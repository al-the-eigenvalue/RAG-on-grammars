                                                CHAPTER 1                         THE LANGUAGE AND ITS SPEAKERS1.1 THE LANGUAGE
    Wambaya is a non-Pama-Nyungan language from the Barkly Tablelands region in the
northern central part of the Northern Territory. It belongs to the West Barkly language
family, which occupies an area of the central Northern Territory very roughly bounded by
Daly Waters in the north-west, Borroloola in the north-east, Brunette Downs Station in the
south-east and Renner Springs in the south-west (see Maps 1 and 2). The West Barkly
languages are part of a larger subgroup known as the Mirndi group which also contains the
Jaminjungan languages: Jaminjung, Ngaliwuru and Nungali. The location of these languages
is shown in Map 1.
   Phonologically, Wambaya is fairly typical for an Australian language. The phoneme
inventory contains five places of articulation for stops (bilabial, alveolar, postalveolar, palatal
and velar), with a nasal corresponding to each stop articulation. Voicing is not phonemically
distinctive. There are three laterals corresponding to the three non-peripheral stop articulations
(alveolar, postalveolar and palatal), an alveolar tap/trill, three semivowels: /w/, Lr,,/ and /j/, and
three vowels: [i], [u] and [a], with no significant phonemic length distinction. In all of the
other West Barkly languages there is a sixth stop articulation, a dorso-palatal, described by
Chadwick (1978:9) as having an onset near the front of the velum and a palatalised release.
This stop does not occur in Wambaya and I have only ever heard one example of it in
Gudanji_ Wambaya words are mostly disyllabic or longer and, except for the auxiliary, never
end in a consonant.
   There are seven parts of speech in Wambaya: nominals (including nouns, adjectives,
demonstratives, free pronouns and time and locational nominals), verbs, adverbs, the
auxiliary (including cross-referencing bound pronouns and tense/aspect/mood/directional
suffixes), particles, clitics and interjections.
   Pronouns distinguish person (1st, 2nd and 3rd) and number (singular, dual and plural).
First person non-singular makes an inclusive/exclusive distinction, and a gender distinction is
made in the third person singular.
   Wambaya nominals generally inflect for case, gender' and number. Although there are
three numbers — singular, dual and plural — only dual nouns are obligatorily marked for
number. All modifiers must agree with the noun that they modify in all of these categories.
   There are four genders in Wambaya, marked by suffixes. In this respect Wambaya and the
other West Barkly languages are typologically aberrant, as gender in other non-Pama-
Nyungan languages, along with much of the verbal morphology, is usually marked by
prefix.'- In fact, apart from the West Barkly languages, the only other non-Pama-Nyungan    I follow Corbett (1991:5) in using this term for what are more traditionally referred to as 'noun classes'.
2   The Jarrakan languages also have genders marked solely by suffixes (Ian Green, pers.comm.).

languages which are not prefixing in at least the verbal domain a re the Tangkic languages,
such as Kayardild and Lardil.3
   The four genders in Wambaya are masculine (Class I), feminine (Class II), vegetable
(Class III) and neuter (Class Iv). Class membership is primarily semantically based. There are
two series of gender suffixes: those which occur in the nominative and accusative cases
(absolutive) and those which occur in all other cases (non-absolutive).4 Gender is marked on
nouns, adjectives, demonstratives and some indefinite/interrogatives.
   Wambaya is a `split-ergative' language: nominals (excluding free pronouns) have an
ergative-absolutive pattern of inflection while the free pronouns have a nominative/accusative
declension. Following Goddard (1982), the class of nominals as a whole is analysed as
having a three-way case system: ergative (/locative), nominative and accusative (see §4.4).
   A second position auxiliary, obligatorily present in most Wambaya clauses, contains
bound pronouns representing the subject and object arguments of the clause. This auxiliary
also contains most of the tense, aspect and mood information for the clause, and can contain
directional affixes indicating movement towards or away from the speaker. Unusually, the
auxiliary has no root.
   Some further unusual aspects of Wambaya grammar include: a subjective/objective
distinction that is made by some adjectives (see §3.1), a suffix found with kinship nominals
which appears to have a reflexive possessive function (see §4.5.1.2) and some verbs which
alternate in transitivity without changing their form (see §7.2.7).
   As is common for Australian languages, Wambaya is morphologically agglutinative and
the word order is relatively free.","[18, 19, 20]"
"   Note that guyala functions both as an interjection meaning `no, nothing' and as a particle
negating a clause, as in guyala nguda yarru `I didn't go'. This is the only other exception to
the mutually exclusivity of word class membership. Interestingly Evans (1995a:87) gives
warirra `nothing' as the only Kayardild word that may belong to more than one word class,
serving both as a nominal and an interjection.' 1
3.2 GRAMMATICAL RELATIONS
3.2.1 CORE FUNCTIONS, ADJUNCTS AND COMPLEMENTS
  Grammatical relations (or grammatical functions), such as subject, object, indirect object,
complement and adjunct, are important in describing many syntactic and morphological
10 Note that the auxiliary is essentially a bundle of clitics. However, its special status in Wambaya
      grammar warrants its treatment as a distinct part of speech.
1 l Bill McGregor (pers.comm.) points out that the possible use of guyala as an interjection does not
      necessarily justify the claim that it belongs to more than one word class since it is not uncommon in
      languages for words of other classes to be used as complete utterances of their own, as in the use of
       `Man!' in English, for example. However, the two uses of guyala have different characteristics — as a
      particle, for example, guyala must co-occur with counter-factual mood marking in the auxiliary (see
       §7.6.I.1)— and thus are considered members of different word classes here.
54    Chapter 3processes in Wambaya. While these functions all have close associations with semantic roles,
the semantic roles are not necessarily invariant; a particular grammatical function may have
one semantic role with one verb, and a different semantic role with another. The role of
grammatical functions, therefore, is to provide the link between the surface morphological
and/or syntactic structure and the semantic level at which lexical predicates select arguments
with specific semantic roles (Bresnan 1982:288).
   Distinctions can be made within the grammatical functions according to two main
parameters: whether or not the function is subcategorisable by a verb, and whether the
function is semantically restricted, or semantically unrestricted.12 The criterion of sub-
categorisability separates adjuncts from other types of grammatical relations. Adjuncts are
never subcategorised for and can potentially occur with any verb. Adjuncts are semantically
transparent in that an adjunct's meaning is consistent and predictable and is not affected by
the verb with which it may occur.
   Among the subcategorisable functions, namely subject, object, indirect object and
complements, a distinction can be made according to whether or not the function is
semantically restricted (i.e. is only ever linked to an argument having a particular semantic
role) or semantically unrestricted (i.e. can be linked to any type of argument) (Bresnan
1982:293-294). Thus we can distinguish core functions (subject, object, indirect object) from
complements on this basis.13 Core functions are always subcategorisable and are
semantically unrestricted in that their meaning (i.e. their semantic role) is dependent upon the
verb of which they are an argument. Thus, the subject of one verb may have the semantic role
of agent, but that of another may be a perceiver or an undergoer. Similarly semantic roles
such as patient, perceived entity and location may all be paired with the grammatical function
of object subcategorised for by different verbs. Complements on the other hand, although
subcategorisable,14 are more closely linked with specific semantic roles and have a consistent
and predictable way of contributing to the meaning of the sentence (Andrews 1985:92).
Complements, therefore, form the middle ground so to speak, between semantically
transparent and non-subcategorisable adjuncts on the one end and semantically non-
transparent and subcategorisable core functions on the other.
   Some examples and a brief discussion of the types of complements and adjuncts found in
Wambaya follow. As the core functions are always subcategorised for, and are directly
related to, the verb of which they are an argument, they are discussed in §7.2, which deals
with the syntax of simple verbal clauses, and verb argument structures.
   Complements have invariant meanings which are related to, and easily characterised in
terms of, their case marking. Yet, unlike adjuncts, they can combine with only certain verbs,
and would therefore be part of a full dictionary entry for their governing verb. A verb such as
12 This terminology and the system of classification of grammatical relations is taken from Bresnan
    (1982:287).
13 Note that I use the term `indirect object' to refer to a type of object that is marked with an oblique case
    (usually dative). This is in contrast to what I simply refer to as `objects', which are marked with
    accusative case. Bresnan (1982) does not make such a distinction; in Bresnan's classification, these are
    both a type of object.
14 Note that there is a slight difference here in the use of the word `subcategorisable'. The sub-
    categorisability of complements is different from that of core functions in that core functions are
    generally obligatory (i.e. a transitive verb has an obligatory subject and object) while complements are
    more often optional (i.e. a verb of motion can have an optional ablative or allative complement
    indicating the source or the direction of the motion).
                                                                 Parts of speech and other preliminaries   55junmi `cut' can take a complement indicating the instrument used (example (3-17)); and
motion verbs such as bardgu `fall' and yarru `go' can take a complement in the allative case
(3-18) or the ablati ve case (3-19) denoting the direction or source of the movement.
     (3-17) Junmi wurlu-ngg-a jabarrini-ni.

            I came from a long way.
   Some verbs subcategorise for . `subject complements' — secondary predicates sub-
categorised for by the verb and agreeing in case, number and gender with the subject. An
example of this is the verb manku in its sense 'to feel', which subcategorises for a reflexive
object and a subject complement denoting the state of affairs of the subject:
     (3-20) Manku ngî-ngg-a baginga.
            feel      I SGA-RR-NF bad.II(NOM)
            I feel no good.
   Similarly, perception verbs can subcategorise for what could be considered an `object.
complement' — a secondary predicate which modifies the object, denoting the state in which
the object is perceived:15
     (3-21) Ngajbi ng-a          alaji
            see      ISG.A-PST child.i(ACC) alone.I(ACC)
            I saw the boy alone.
   Like complements, adjuncts have consistent meanings which remain unaffected by the
nature of the verb with which they occur. However; unlike complements, adjuncts are not
selected by verbs and can potentially co-occur with any type of verb in a clause. Typical
examples of adjuncts include locative phrases (example (3-22)), temporal phrases (3-23),
benefactive dative phrases (3-24) and secondary predicates (3-25).
     (3-22) Ngajbî ngi-ny-a         munjungu-nu.

4.8 FREE PRONOUNS
   While nominals generally operate on an ergative-absolutive system of case marking, free
pronouns (except for the possessive forms) have a nominative-accusative case marking
system; thus, ergative and nominative case forms are homophonous. There is also an oblique
pronoun form which is used in the dative case and serves as the base for other case forms.
Possessive pronouns, like all other nominals, have homophonous nominative and accusative
forms. They agree in gender, number and case with the noun that they modify and are the
only pronoun forms that can occur as a modifier in a NP.
   As was discussed in §4.4.3 above, there is just one nominal case that covers both ergative
and locative case functions. Unfortunately, there are no examples in the corpus of free
pronouns in the locative case and thus it is not possible to tell whether pronouns also collapse
the two cases, as all other nominals do.75 If it is found that pronouns formally distinguish
ergative and locative cases, following the line of argument presented in Goddard (1982), this
distinction should be extended to the class of nominals as a whole. Thus, the analysis
proposed here for all nominals would have to be changed such that there are two distinct
cases that simply have homophonous case marking. However, for present purposes I will
assume that pronouns behave as other nominals, but will gloss the ergative pronoun forms as
`ERG', rather than `LOC', since they are not found in locative function in the corpus.
   Nominative and ergative free pronouns are relatively uncommon and are largely used for
emphatic purposes, as are singular accusative free pronouns. Dual Lind plural accusative
pronouns are used more frequently since object bound pronouns in the auxiliary register only74   The glosses in this example are mine.
75 All attempts to elicit pronouns in the locative function produced either examples involving the allative
     case. or constructions which avoided the use of a pronoun all together. It may he that pronouns ate
     semantically incompatible with the locative case function in Wamhaya (as they appear to he with the
     instrumental case function, for example). Further research is required.
126     Chapter4person; the free object pronouns are therefore required to provide information as to the
number of the object (this is discussed in greater detail in §5.1).
   Table 4.18 contains the non-possessive pronoun forms. The possessive pronouns are
given in Table 4.19 below. Note that the language does not have any third person singular
non-oblique pronouns; when necessary, demonstratives are used instead (this is quite
common in Australian languages; see Dixon (1980)). As ergative and nominative forms are
homophonous, I have listed them together in Table 4.18.

   Note that there are no more than two forms for each pronoun. The singular pronouns have
homophonous nominative, ergative and accusative forms, and a different form for oblique,
while the non-singular pronouns have one form that covers nominative and ergative cases and
another one that is used for both accusative and oblique.
   The non-singular accusative/oblique forms are clearly derived from the non-singular
nominative/ergative forms. The non-singular nominative/ergative forms are made up of a
pronoun base followed by either -wani (after /u/) or -yani (after /i/). The accusative/oblique
forms are derived by replacing the final vowel of the pronoun base with /a/. Thus:
                    Pronoun Base NOM/ERG      ACC/OBL
       1DU.INC      mirndi-      mirndi-yani mirnd-a
       3DU          wurlu-       wurlu-wani wurl-a
   While the singular nominative, ergative and accusative forms are a little unpredictable, the
oblique forms also appear to consist of a pronoun base of which the final vowel is replaced
by /a/. This pronoun base is not found in any other non-possessive pronoun forms, but does
appear in the possessive pronouns; see below.

       3SG.M       nangi-          nang-a76    Evidence for the existence of the final vowels of these roots comes from the analysis of possessive
      pronouns and is discussed below.

consonant of the base is dropped to form the oblique pronoun:

      3SG.F ngayang-     ngaya
   The pronoun forms are basically the same for all three dialects of the McArthur group.
However, in Gudanji the non-singular accusative and oblique forms all contain the additional
final syllable -ga: mirndaga IDU.INC.ACC/OBL', wurlaga `3DU.ACC/OBL' and so on. It seems
that the Wambaya forms may have originally contained this syllable too, as it appears before
the comitative suffix (see below), and is present in the stem of the dative demonstratives (see
§4.6.1).
  Many examples of the use of these pronouns can be found throughout this volume. Some
more follow.

   The oblique forms are used in the dative case (as in examples (4-285) and (4-286)) and
serve as the base for the comitative case forms. In the comitative case the suffix -yili is added
to the oblique form of the pronoun. In the singular forms, the final vowel of the oblique
pronoun assimilates to the vowel of the suffix:
   (4-287) Alajî          gi-n               mirra ngarri-yîlî.

   In the non-singular forms the -ga present in the Gudanji accusative and oblique forms (and
presumably originally in Wambaya) appears before the comitative suffix:

   Possessive pronouns, like most nominals, have an ergative/absolutive case-marking
system; nominative and accusative case forms are homophonous. Table 4.19 lists the
nominative/accusative forms of the possessive pronouns, which agree in gender, number and
case with the noun that they modify (i.e. the possessed noun). A question mark following a
form indicates that the form has been inferred on the basis of other members of the paradigm,
but is not present in the corpus.

    The possessive pronouns are derived from the pronoun bases discussed above. With first
and second person singular, the forms for Classes I, II and III are formed by adding the
appropriate gender suffix: -0/-ni- `I ABS/NABS', -rna/-nga- `H ABS/NABS' and -ma/-mi- `III
ABS/NABS' respectively. The Class IV gender suffixes -gal-gi- `IV ABS/NABS' replace the final
vowel of the pronoun base. Third person singular masculine behaves in the same way as first
and second person singular. Third person singular feminine however, takes the Class I suffix
-ji (and-nyî- in the non-absolutive), and the Class H suffix -nga (both in the absolutive and
non-absolutive). The final nasal of the pronoun base becomes palatal before the palatal stop
of the Class I suffix and is dropped before the nasal of the Class II suffix.

  Evidence for the forms of these pronoun bases is the fact that these are the forms to which
dual and plural number suffixes are attached (see §4.3 for a discussion cf number and

      set of these different case forms only for Classes I and II. I have not been able to get ergative/locative or
      dative forms of Class tit or Class tv demonstratives. The main reasons for these gaps are the infrequency
      with which Class III or Class Iv nouns occur in either the ergative/locative or dative cases. and the
      difficulty in forcing the demonstrative to be present on the rare occasions that these nouns do occur in
      these cases. In the few examples in which I succeeded in forcing a Class iv demonstrative in a transitive
      subject NP, the nominative form of the demonstrative was used:

      Chadwick (1978) also does not give ergative/locative or dative demonstratives for Classes ut and IV, so it.
      is unclear if it is a gap in the data or a gap in the system.

given following each set of Wambaya forms. As the nominative and accusative forms are
always homophonous in all languages, I have listed them together under the heading NOM/

      that they have a proximate meaning, rather than a remote meaning, in Wambaya.
44 I have called this case `LOC' on analogy with the Wambaya case although it is not exactly the same in all
      languages/dialects. While all the Eastern Group languages/dialects have one case suffix that is used to
      mark both ergative and locative case functions (-ni), both Gudanji and Ngarnga have an alternative case
     suffix that can also be used to mark locative case (-nbi). Ngarnga also has a separate instrumental case
     suffix, -warndu, unlike the McArthur dialects, which use the ergative/locative case suffix in this function
      (Chadwick 1978:161).

the preceding vowel, can be elided in fast or casual speech.

   The demonstratives in Wambaya have been morphologically conservative, retaining the
original prefixing system. Thus, gender in the demonstratives is indicated by prefixes, most
of which correspond with the gender suffixes found on Wambaya nominals (see §4.2.2 and
Appendix B for a discussion of gender marking). The following table gives both the gender
prefixes found on demonstratives and the main gender suffixes found on other nominals.
                               TABLE 4.15: GENDER MARKING

                                                   -a     -I   It can be seen in the above table that the Class II prefixes on demonstratives correspond
exactly with the first pair of Class II noun suffixes (-rna and -nga). The Class III absolutive
prefix also corresponds exactly with the Class III absolutive noun suffix. The Class I
absolutive prefix -î and the noun suffix ji are very similar and probably both derive from an
original prefix -ji, the initial consonant of which has lenited in the present-day forms. That
this is the original prefix is supported by the appearance of the prefix ji- in some Class I
demonstratives in Binbinka, such as jirriga `remote singular nominative/accusative Class I'.
The Class ry prefix -ya is probably related to the suffix -a found on some Class IV nouns and
modifiers. The fact that the gender prefixes on demonstratives are similar to the suffixes
found on other nominals supports the theory that gender suffixes on nominals may have
developed from the reduction of postposed demonstratives (see Appendix B and I. Green
1995 for a comparative discussion of gender marking in the Mirndi languages).
   The demonstrative system is easily analysable. All dual and plural forms can be derived
from the singular forms, and the singular forms are made up of a gender prefix, a stern and
either a proximate or a remote marker. The complete structure of a demonstrative can be
schematised as follows:
      Gender prefix + Stem + `Distance' + Number(.Gender) + Case
      Notes:
        (i) `Distance' refers to `proximate' versus `remote'.
       (ii) The `number' slot only contains gender marking in plural number.
112     Chapter 4
         (iii) There are two forms in which the order of the `number' and the `distance'
               suffixes are reversed: inuwuliyaga `remote dual nominative/accusative Class I'
               and nanawuliyaga `remote dual nominative/accusative Class II'.
     The different forms for each of these categories are as follows:
Gender prefixes (ABS; NABS)
    Class I: {i-; ni-}
    Class II: {na-; nga-}
    Class III: {ma-; ?}
    Class Iv: {ya-; ?}
Stem
        Nominative, Accusative:        { -ni- (I); -na- (II, Iv); -ma- (III) }45
        Ergative/Locative:             { -nki- (I, II), -nka- (II) }46
        Dative:                        {-naga-
   When the remote suffix -yaga is added to the stem, the final low vowel of the stem
becomes high. Thus, -na- becomes -ni-yaga; -naga- becomes -nagî-yaga, and so forth.
   Evans (1990) discusses the tendency in Australian languages for demonstratives to derive
from verbs of stance (i.e. `sit', `stand' or `lie') or verbs of perception (i.e. `see, look').
Thus, it is possible that the nominative and accusative demonstrative stems in Wambaya, if
their underlying form is taken to be -na- (see footnote 45), may have developed from the
common non-Pama-Nyungan verb na meaning `see, look' (Evans 1990:144).
    The dative stem -naga- appears to be made up of the nominative/accusative stem -na-
followed by the suffix -ga which occurs with all non-singular object and oblique free
pronouns in Ngarnga and Gudanji (Chadwick 1978:51), and appears in Wambaya non-
singular oblique pronouns with the addition of the comitative suffix; for example, mirndiga-
yîlî `1DU.INC.OBL-COMIT'.
Distance
      Proximate: {-0}
      Remote:    {-yaga/-ya; -ma)
   The remote suffix -yaga is reduced to -ya when it is followed by either the dual or the
plural suffix. The remote suffix -ma is found only in the singular nominative/accusative
forms.
     There are a couple of examples in the corpus in which both remote suffixes are used:
45  The variation in the form of the stem can probably be explained in terms of vowel harmony and analogic
    nasal assimilation. Thus, if the underlying form is taken to be -na-, then the Class i form (-ni-) could be
    explained in terms of vowel harmony triggered by the preceding high vowel in the prefix, and the Class
    tit form (-ma-) as assimilation of the alveolar nasal in the stem to the bilabial nasal of the prefix. There
    is no evidence that these assimilation processes are productive synchronically (most vowel harmony is
    regressive (see §2.3.4.3) and there are no other known instances of such nasal assimilation). However,
    the presence of the alveolar nasal in the stem of the two Class iii Binbinka demonstratives ntaniga
    `remote singular nominative/accusative Class w' and manigula `remote dual nominative/accusative Class
    Ill' adds support to the theory that the Wambaya Class Ili stem may have derived from one containing an

   The dual and plural case suffixes are regular for nominals: the regular nominal suffixes are
-0 for both the nominative case and the accusative case, -ni for the ergative/locative case and
-nka for the dative case, and nominals inflected with the dual suffix take -ji in the
ergative/locative case and -ja in the dative case. The only aspect of case marking that is
unusual to demonstratives is that the singular forms have a zero inflection for the
ergative/locative case and the dative case. Usually a singular nominal would take the regular
ergative/locative and dative case suffixes (see §4.4).

4.9 NP STRUCTURE
   A Wambaya noun phrase consists of a head and one or more modifiers, all of which are
optional (the head can be ellipsed when it is recoverable from previous discourse; see below).
All members of the NP must agree in terms of gender, number and case (where
morphologically possible). As is common to several Australian languages, elements of NPs in
Wambaya need not be contiguous in the clause. This possibility of discontinuous NP
constituents has led researchers working on some Australian languages (e.g. Heath 1986 on
Nunggubuyu, Blake 1983 on Kalkatungu) to suggest that these languages may not have NP
                                                                                                Nominals      131constituents, and that apparent NPS can just be treated as apposed nominals. I will not review
the arguments for this analysis here, but assume that the following two pieces of evidence
argue for the existence of a NP constituent in Wambaya, at least in those cases in which the
elements are contiguous (see below for more discussion of discontinuous NPs):
     (i) Usually the auxiliary must follow the initial word of a clause. However, it is possible
         for the auxiliary to follow a complex NP, thereby providing evidence for its existence
         as a constituent_ The position of the auxiliary can then be described as being after the
         initial constituent of a clause.
     (ii) In possessive phrases in which the possessor is marked with either genitive or dative
          case, relational case marking is found only on the head of the NP. As relational case
          marking is not found on the possessor nominal in this situation, the case marking
          found on the head nominal also refers to the modifying nominal, thereby providing
          evidence that the two nominals in such phrases form a single NP constituent.
   The structure of a Wambaya NP is as follows.78 Note that any one of the modifers listed in
the position before the head can be postposed to follow the head.79
       (MODIFIERS)                       (HEAD) (MODIFIER)
       (Dem)(POSS)(Num)(Adj) Nom
       Dem = Demonstrative
       POSS = Possessive pronoun or demonstrative, or possessive NP
       Num = Numeral
       Adj = Adjective
       Nom = Nominal
  The head is usually filled by a noun, but can in principle be any type of nominal. An
example from Text 1 in Appendix A in which a numeral functions as the head is:
     (4-301) Garnguji=miji                in-i-n                mirra.
               many.I(NOM~INFER 3PL.S(NP)-PROG sit
               There must be a big group (of people).
   The fact that this example occurs at the beginning of the text (i.e. the second line) before
there has been any mention of people, suggests that the numeral is functioning as the head,
rather than simply modifying an ellipsed head. However, there are a small number of
examples in which it may be argued that the head has been ellipsed. Consider the following
sequence (lines 62-64) from the same text:S0
78    This is the same structure as in Kayardild (Evans 1995a) and is very similar to the Gooniyandi structure
      (McGregor 19%).
79    In his detailed discussion of Gooniyandi noun phrases, McGregor (1990) makes a distinction between
      reference modification and referent modification, and shows that this distinction correlates with a contrast
      in function between pre-head and post-head modifiers. Thus, an element which precedes the head modifies
      the reference of the head nominal, it selects a subset of the potential referents denoted by the nominal. In
      contrast. a post-head constituent modifies the head's referent, indicating a quality of property of the thing
      itself, which may be independent of the nominal denoting the entity (p. 26711). Further research is needed
      to determine whether there is likewise a semantic difference between pre- and post- head modifiers in
      Wambaya.
80    This discussion has benefited greatly from McGregor's (1990) discussion of NPs in Gooniyandi,

            many.i(ACC) 3DU.A-HAB.PST hit
            They'd been killing a lot of them.
  In this example, in contrast to that given in (4-301), garnguji in the final line appears to be
modifying the ellipsed head juwarramba which is mentioned in the preceding two clauses.
Thus, this is one example in which an NP has no overt constituent corresponding to its head.
   A NP can also be made up of a pronoun. A (non-possessive) pronoun is always the head
of a phrase, and usually occurs alone (although see below for some possible exceptions to
this).
   Some example NPs are:

   Although the tendency is for NPs to be contiguous, it is possible for members of a NP to be
separated in the clause. In the majority of these examples, one element of the discontinuous
NP appears initially in the clause (see examples (4-312)-(4-314)), but this is not always the
case (see (4-315)).
  Examples of discontinuous NPs are:
  (4-312) Garngunya gin-aji                yabu garirda-rdarra       garndawugini-ni.
          manylRACC) 3SG.M.A-HAB.PST have wife.Il-GROUP(ACC) one.i-LOC

   A great deal more work is needed on discontinuous constituents in Wambaya and the
discourse conditions under which they are possible.                    .
  A small set of nouns can also be used as modifiers, modifying a head noun. The most
common examples of this involve the noun bungmajî `old man' (1):
   (4-316) Garidi-ni      bungmanyi-ni gin-amany     yanybi.
           husband.I-LOC old.man.I-LOC 3SG.M.A-P.TWD get

           mawula-ji-nka.
           play-TH-DAT
           My old man uncle came to play (cards).
134     Chapter 4   Another example involves the noun lagurra `hole'. Note that despite the fact that it belongs
to a different gender, lagurra shows no gender agreement with the head noun in this example:
     (4-318) Yabu ng-aji             lagurra        juruma.
             have 1SG.A-HAB.PST hole.IV(ACC) stomach.IIl(ACC)
             I used to have a deep stomach (i.e. I was very thin).
   In a couple of examples an oblique pronoun co-occurs with a noun. In these examples it is
difficult to determine whether the two belong to one NP or to different NPs. However, the fact
that pronouns usually occur alone in a NP, and that there is usually (but not always) a pause
between the pronoun and the noun, suggests that it may be better to treat these examples as
containing two apposed NPs, as in the English translations.
     (4-319) Yandu irrî          ngaya     bulungunga-nka.
             wait   3PL.S(NP) 3SG.F.OBL young.woman.II-DAT
             They wait for her, the young woman.
     (4-320) Yangula g-a         yarru naniyaga          mujuju-ngunya
             NEG       3SG.S-PST go     that.II.SG.NOM menstruation-PROP.II(NOM)
             irrîga-yîli-nmanji juwa-nmanji.
             3PL.OBL-COMIT-ALL man.I-ALL
             That menstruating woman can't go near them, the men.
   However, in at least one example in the corpus, a pronoun appears between a modifier and
a noun, making the apposition analysis harder to justify:
     (4-321) Jawaranya          ng-u        yidanyî ngaba ng-u               yardi
             billycan.II(ACC) ISG.A-FUT get          THEN      1SG.A-FUT put
             yaniya           cool drink nînaka            nanga         juglni-nka.
             that.IV.SG.ACC cool drink this.I.SG.DAT 3SG.M.OBL boy.t-DAT
             I'm going to get the billycan and put that cold drink (in it) for this boy.
   Further investigation is required. In particular, it is necessary to test whether a pronoun +
noun combination can appear before the auxiliary before it can be determined whether they
can together make up a single NP.
INALIENABLE POSSESSION
   As mentioned in §4.8, Wambaya makes a formal distinction between two types of
possessive constructions: alienable and inalienable. In constructions of alienable possession
the possessor is expressed by either a possessive pronoun or demonstrative, or by a nominal
inflected with either the dative or genitive case. In constructions of inalienable possession,
however, there is no special marking on the possessor nominal and the two nominals occur in
juxtaposition. Examples of constructions of alienable possession are found in §4.8. §4.6.
§4.4.4 and §4.4.10. A discussion of inalienable possession follows.
   Constructions of inalienable possession are the most common type of what are commonly
referred to as part-whole constructions.81 These constructions are thus in contrast to those of
alienable possession, which encode two entities as being associated, but easily separable.","[148, 149, 150, 151, 152]"
"5     In dreamtime stories where this sort of a construction is common (e.g. `make oneself into a bird'), the
      verb yardi `put' is used reflexively, with the resultant state expressed as a subject complement. Thus:
          J1anvila            wurlu-ngg-a yardi bungmaj-bulu.
          eaglehawk.II(ACC) 3DU.A-RR-NF put            old.person-DU(ACC)
          The two old women turned themselves into eaglehawks.
6     This is a type of bird — see Text 2 in Appendix A.
7     Wierzbicka (1988:116-117) discusses such constructions in Japanese. However, in Japanese these
      experiential sentences are only possible in the first person.
                                                                   Parts of speech and other preliminaries     49  For a more detailed discussion of verbless clauses and the use of mina as a copula-like
verb see §7.1.
   These adjectives are doubly interesting as they each have a homophonous verb form which
has the same meaning as the subjective meaning of the adjective. That these are verbs and not
adjectives is shown in the following examples in which the form co-occurs with an auxiliary
and takes no gender agreement with the subject NP.8
    (3-6)    Bagijbi gi            juruma.
             feel.bad 3SG.S(PR) stomach.I1I(NOM)
             He feels no good in the stomach.
    (3-7) Gurzjbi g-u             marala            ngaji-ni.
          feel.good 3SG.S-FUT heart.IV(NOM) see-LOC
          She will be happy to see (her). (lit. Her heart will feel good seeing (her).)
(iii) Free Pronouns
    Free pronouns form a small, closed class. They are referred to as 'free' to differentiate
them from the 'bound' pronouns that form part of the auxiliary (discussed below). Free
pronouns distinguish person (first, second and third), number (singular, dual and plural) and.
make an inclusive/exclusive distinction in the first person non-singular. There are no third
person singular subject or object pronouns; demonstratives are used instead.
   Free pronouns have a different system of case marking from nouns and adjectives. While
nouns and adjectives have an ergative/absolutive system of case marking, free pronouns have
a nominative/accusative declension with nominative and ergative case forms being
homophonous- Free pronouns also have an oblique form which is used in the dative case and
as the base for the addition of other case suffixes such as the comitative. In the case of non-
singular pronouns, this oblique form is homophonous with the accusative case form.
a    It is interesting to consider the possible relationship between the verbs and their corresponding adjectives.
     The final jbi of the adjective gurijbi (and also bagijbi) is identical to a final sequence that in Wambaya is
     quite distinctively verbal. There are many verbs that have this form: ngajbi 'see', gajbi 'eat', nyagajbi 'be
     tired', and it is also found in verbs derived from adjectives with the inchoative suffix jbi: yarduga
     'strong' (Iv) becomes varduga jbi 'become strong' (see §6.2.2.1). This suggests that the adjective gurijbi
     may be derived from the verb gurijbi, thereby accounting for its verb-like form. This theory is supported
     by the other gender forms of the adjective which are all based on this (verbal) form. The usual case
     among adjectives is for the Class iv form to he identical to the root, and therefore to serve as the base for
     the derivation of the other gender forms (see §4.2.2). However with gurijbi it is the Class I form (which
     is identical to the verbal form) from which the other forms are derived. This is shown most clearly by the
     Class II form gurijbi-rna in which the Class Ii gender suffix is simply added on to the full Class I form.
     The situation with bagijbi is different in at least two respects. Firstly, there is some variation among
     speakers as to whether the Class I form of the adjective is correctly pronounced bagijbi or bagiji. For
     some speakers either form is possible, for others only the latter is possible as the Class I form of the
     adjective. And secondly, the other gender forms are not derived from the Class I (and verbal) form, as is
     the case with gurijbi, but are clearly all derived (quite regularly) from a common root bagig - :
          Class I     bagiji/(bagijbi)
          Class 11 bagi-nga
          Class III baging-ma
          Class Iv bagi-ga
     The verbal form bagijbi is clearly also derived from this root.
     The next question is why, if the Class I form of the adjective is actually bagiji, it is often pronounced
     bagijbi, which is the verbal form? It seems quite probable that this could have happened on analogy with
     gurijbi, particularly as it is quite common in fast speech for both gurijbi and bagijbi to he pronounced
     guriji and bagiji respectively (even for the verbal form).
50     Chapter 3Singular pronouns have homophonous nominative, accusative and ergative case forms and
then a different oblique form. Free pronouns are discussed in §4.8.
(iv) Demonstratives
   Demonstratives in Wambaya make a two-way spatial distinction which is roughly
comparable to the distinction in English between `this' and `that'. Demonstratives must also
agree with their referent in case, gender and number. Like nouns and adjectives,
demonstratives can occur alone as the head of a NP, or function as a modifier. Demonstratives
are discussed in §4.6.
(v) Locational nominals
   These nominals are inherently locative and include the compass directionals (langga
`north', ngîrnii `south', gagarra `east', bayungu `west'), other general directionals (gayangga
`up', jangi `down'), locational demonstratives (gili `here', gîlîyaga `there') and other
locationals such as murrgu `inside'. Although these locational nominals can be inflected with
the allative and ablative cases, they are distinguished from other nominals by not taking the
locative case; they occur uninflected in a locative NP:
     (3-8)   Mirra gî-n              murrgu.
             sit    3SG.S(PR)-PROG inside
             She's sitting inside.
(vi) Temporal nominals
   Temporal nominals provide temporal information for the clause and thus tend to have co-
occurrence restrictions with the tense of the clause. Temporal nominals are found in the
corpus with only the locative and dative nominal case suffixes; for example ngurraramba-nî
`in the night' (night-LOC) and ngijininîma-nka `until tomorrow' (tomorrow-DAT).
(vii) Indefinite/interrogatives
   Cross-cutting this division of nominals is the subclass of indefinite/interrogatives. These
nominals can be used both as interrogatives (e.g. `who') and as indefinites (e.g. `someone').
There are indefinite/interrogative pronouns (e.g. gayini `who, someone/what, something'),
quantifiers (e.g. yangulany- `how many, some amount'), locationals (e.g. injani `where,
somewhere'), and temporals (e.g. yangulu `when, sometime'). Indefinite/interrogatives tend
to occur initially in the clause. These nominals are discussed in §4.7.","[66, 67, 68]"
"
31 The suffix -mbili in Jingili is used to mark both locative and comitative case functions (see Chadwick
     1975:20).
                                                                                          Nominals   934.4.10 GENITIVE SUFFIX
   The genitive suffix, along with the proprietive (§4.4.11), the privative (§4.4.12) and the
origin (§4.4.13) suffixes, is different from the case suffixes discussed above in that it
functions adnominally, relating one NP to another within one constituent. In contrast, the case
suffixes discussed above function to indicate the role of a NP within a simple clause and
therefore have a relational function (Dench and Evans 1988:2). Formally these suffixes differ
from other case suffixes in that they are inflected for gender and (except for the genitive) can
themselves be inflected for case.
   The genitive suffix marks the possessor of a possessive NP and agrees in gender with the
possessed (head) noun. More commonly the dative suffix is used to mark possession (see
§4.4.4), and there are thus only a limited number of examples of the genitive suffix in the
corpus. Almost all of these examples have Class Iv agreement, but there are a few with Class
I and Class II agreement. The regular forms of the genitive suffix are nîganji (I), niganya (II)
and niganka (IV);32 irregular allomorphs are found with kinship nouns and are discussed
below. The first vowel of the regular suffix assimilates to the preceding vowel of the stem,
giving the alternative forms nuganka and naganka. The genitive suffix is attached to the non-
absolutive gender form of the noun. Some examples are:
   (4-146) Nayidanga-nî guyala nguy-udi                  ngajbi, juwa-nîganka.
           woman.II-LOC NEG       3SG.NM.A-NACT.PR see           man.I-GEN.IV
           Women can't see (the dance), (it) belongs to men.
   (4-147) Yana            balamurru       bungmanyi-nîganka.
           this.IV.SG.NOM spear.IV(NOM) old.man.I-GEN.IV
           This spear belongs to the old man.
   (4-148) murlu-nuganka mijangga
           eye.IV-GEN.IV medicine.IV(NOM)
           eye medicine
  The case suffix of the possessive phrase appears only on the head noun (i.e. on the
possessed noun); there is no case marking that follows the regular genitive suffi x. This is true
whether the head noun precedes or follows the genitive noun. Some examples of genitive
phrases with non-zero case suffixes are:
   (4-149) Yarru ngi          bungmanya-naganka magi-nmanji.
           go     ISG.S(PR) old.woman.II-GEN.IV camp.IV-ALL
           I'm going to the old woman's camp.
   (4-150) Ayani ngi             magi-nka     bungmanya-naganka.
           look.for ISG.S(PR) camp.IV-DAT old.woman.II-GEN.IV
           I'm looking for the old woman's camp.
   However, speakers will accept as grammatical examples in which both the possessed noun
and the genitive noun are inflected for case, although they do not produce such examples
themselves:
   (4-151) Mina ngi            alangi-niganka-ni                  jalyu-ni.
           sit      ISG.S(PR) boy.I-GEN.IV-LOC                    bed.IV-LOC
           I'm sitting on the boy's bed.","[110, 111]"
"
3     In this respect I disagree with Blake (1990), who argues that the West Barkly languages can be reanalysed
      as prefixing on the basis of the fact that bound pronouns are prefixed in the auxiliary to what he calls a
      verbal stem (p.54). This analysis is based on examples from Chadwick (1979:681) such as the following
      from Wambaya (I have retained Blake's glosses):
         (a)   Nguba.
               I:go:FUT
               I shall go.
         (b)   Ngajbi nguba
               see        I:go:FUT
              I'll go and see.
      Blake (p.54) claims that (a) contains a verb prefixed with a bound pronoun which in (b) functions as a
      grammatical verb governing a non-finite lexical verb. According to my corpus the form in (a) is not a
      verb but the auxiliary, and can be a complete utterance only in a context where it is clearly understood
      which verb has been ellipsed. Thus, the more correk;t version of (a) would be yarru nguba in which the
      auxiliary occurs with the verb yarru meaning 'go'. The form nguba is made up of the bound pronoun
      ng(i)- representing first person singular subject, and the suffix -uba which indicates that the tense is non-
      past and the action/event involves movement in a direction away from the speaker (see below).
                                                                               The auxiliary   139  Appendix C gives the forms of the auxiliaries in the other Eastern Group languages (from
Chadwick 1978)_
5.1 BOUND PRONOUNS
   Every auxiliary (except for some directional imperative auxiliaries — see §5.3) must contain
a bound pronoun that registers the subject of the clause, and if there is a first or second
person object, then the auxiliary must also contain a bound pronoun registering the object of
the clause. (Third person objects are not registered in the auxiliary. This is discussed in more
detail in §5.2.1.) The presence of bound pronouns in the auxiliary means that it is possible,
and indeed usual, to omit the overt NP if all the necessary information is included in the
bound pronoun itself, or if it is evident from context or previous discourse.
   The bound pronoun system as a whole makes a three-way distinction between transitive
subject (A), intransitive subject (S) and transitive object (0) (Table 5.1), although it is only in.
the third person singular that all three core functions are formally distinguished; all other
bound pronouns have homophonous A and S forms. While the subject bound pronouns
register person and number, object bound pronouns register person only. When the object is
non-singular, the appropriate accusative free pronoun is used to indicate the number of the
object (see below).
                     TABLE 5.1: SUBJECT AND OBJECT BOUND PRONOUNS                                           A          S          O

   Note that a gender distinction is made only in the third person transitive subject forms.
This distinction is between masculine (M), which only refers to Class I nominals, and non-
masculine (NM), which refers to nominals belonging to the feminine gender, Class II, as well
as nominals belonging to the two inanimate genders, Classes III and IV:
   (5-9)   Darranggu-nu ngîyi-ng-a              irrijabî.
           stick.IV-LOC      3SG.NM.A-IO-NF scratch
           The stick scratched me.
   As mentioned above, object bound pronouns distinguish only person, not number, and are
based on the singular subject forms. When the object is singular it is enough to have just the
object bound pronoun in the auxiliary (example (5-10)). When the object is non-singular,
however, the object bound pronoun in the auxiliary must be accompanied by a noun phrase
containing the appropriate accusative free pronoun (5-11), (5-12):
140   Chapter 5
  (5-10)    Jiya-j-ba      ngu-ny-u        gijilulu.
            give-TH-FUT 1SG.A-2SG-FUT money.IV(ACC)
            I will give you (sing.) money.

            hit        3SG.M.A-10-NF 1PL.EXC.ACC
            He hit us.
  When the object is third person non-singular it is not represented in the auxiliary (see
§5.2.1), and must be expressed by a either an accusative free pronoun (example (5-13)), a
noun-headed NP (5-14), or both (5-15), (5-16):
  (5-13)    Ngajbî ng-a        wurla.
            see      1SG.A-PST 3DU.ACC
            I saw them (two).

            old.man-PL.I(ACC) 3SG.M.A-NP.AWY 3PL.ACC take
            He takes all the old men.
   Note that the object free pronoun does not have to follow the auxiliary immediately; see
example (5-15) and the following:
  (5-17)    Guyala ngurr-uji         ngajbi        irra.
            NEG     1PL.INC.A-NACT.PR see          3PL.ACC
            We've never seen them.
   As indicated in Table 5.1, third person objects are not registered in the auxiliary. While a
more typical analysis of the data would be to analyse the third person object morpheme to be
zero, a common situation in both Australian languages and other languages of the world, the
behaviour of auxiliaries of clauses with third person objects with respect to tense marking
indicates that they are best analysed as containing no object bound pronoun at all. The
arguments for this are given in Nordlinger (1993b) and in the discussion of tense marking in
§5.2.1.
   There are a few examples in which a plural bound pronoun is used with dual reference,
with no obvious difference in meaning. The following extract is taken from Text 1 (Appendix
A), in which other examples can also be found (e.g. lines 7-10, 14 and so on). The subject of
this extract is two boys and it begins with one of them talking to the other:
   (5-18)   ""Ngajbî   ngurr-uba        yang           ngangaba najbî

             middle-LOC 3DU.S(NP)-PROG sit
             (who) were sitting in the middle (of their camp).
   There are also examples in which a singular bound pronoun is used with general plural
reference:
  (5-19)     Bungmanyî-ni gun-u             nij-ba, nayida    g-u       gajurra.
             old.man.I-LOC 3SG.M.A-FUT sing-FUT woman.II(NOM) 3SG.S-FUT dance.FuT
             The men will sing (while) the women dance.
  However, in other examples the third person plural form irri is used with non-specific or
general reference, as is `one' or `they' in English:
  (5-20)     Ngarringga irr-a          narunguja.
             take.from 3PL.A-PST car.IV(ACC)
             They've taken (her) car. (when explaining that my car had been sent on a truck
             to Adelaide)
5.1.1 THE REFLEXIVE/RECIPROCAL PRONOUN
  In reflexive and reciprocal constructions, the reflexive/reciprocal bound pronoun (glossed
'RR') occurs in the object position in the auxiliary. The form of this bound pronoun is -ngg 4
and it is followed by regular tense/aspect/mood suffixes (see §5.2.1). Some examples are:
  (5-21)     Gurda ngiyi-ngg-a.
             be.sick 3SG.NM.A-RR-NF
             She is sick.
   (5-22)    Daguma j-ba irri-ngg-i.
             hit-TH-FUT       3PL.A-RR-FUT
             They all will fight.
   (5-23)    Daguma-j-ba wurlu-ngg-u.
             hit-TH-FUT 3DU.A-RR-FUT
             They two will fight.
  Note that, although the transitive forms of the subject bound pronouns are used in these
constructions, a subject NP takes nominative case marking, rather than ergative/locative case
marking (as would usually be expected of a transitive subject; see §4.4.3). Thus, the    Note that the Gudanji form of this pronoun is -ngga as in:
       Ngajbi wurlu-ngga-ma.
       See      3DU.A-RR-PST
       They saw each other.
    This is presumably the underlying form of the Wambaya suffix also; the tense suffix replacing the final
    vowel.
142   Chapter 5reflexive/reciprocal marker appears to detransitivise a transitive verb, as evidenced by the
subject's change in case marking.
  (5-24)    Janji       gini-ngg-a      wagardbi.
            dog.I(NOM) 3SG.M.A-RR-NF wash
            The dog is washing himself.
   (5-25)   Alag-bulu       wurlu-ngg-a nyurrunyurru.
            child-DU(NOM) 3DU.A-RR-NF chase
            The two children are chasing each other.
   This is the only situation in which there is a mismatch between transitive subject bound
pronouns and ergative/locative case marking. In all other types of constructions, a NP
represented by a transitive subject bound pronoun must have ergative/locative case marking.
   While indirect objects of verbs such as ayanî `look (for)' and yandu `wait (for)' are not
cross-referenced in the auxiliary with ordinary object bound pronouns (see example (5-3)
above), they can be cross-referenced by the reflexive/reciprocal pronoun.
   (5-26)   Ayani ngurlu-ngg-a.
            look.for IDU.EXC.A-RR-NF
            We're looking for each other.
   (5-27)   *Ayani ngî-ny-a.
              look.for 1SG.A-20-NF
            I'm looking for you.
   (5-28)   Ayani ngi            nganga.
            look.for 1 SG.S(PR) 2SG.OBL
            I'm looking for you.
   This is, therefore, one way in which indirect objects (marked with dative case) can be
distinguished from dative adjuncts: the latter cannot be cross-referenced by the
reflexive/reciprocal pronoun:
   (5-29)   *Wugbardi ngurlu-ngg-u            gunju.
             cook       1DU.EXC.A-RR-FUT meat.IV(ACC)

3.2.2 DEFINING SUBJECT, OBJECT AND INDIRECT OBJECT
   Following are the properties by which subjects, objects and indirect objects can be
characterised and identified in Wambaya.
SUBJECT I7  (i)      Subject NPs take either the ergative case (A) or the nominative case (S).
 (ii)      In a main verbal clause or a finite subordinate clause, the subject is represented by a
           bound pronoun in the first position in the auxiliary.
 (iii)     In a non-finite subordinate clause the subject is the pivot and is obligatorily omitted,
           being identical to a core argument of the main clause (see §8.1).
 (iv)      In a simultaneous non-finite subordinate clause in which the verb is inflected with the
           nominal suffix -nî, the main-clause subject is that which is co-referential with the
           (omitted) subordinate-clause subject.
 (v)       In a reduced adjoined clause the subject is the pivot and is omitted, being co-
           referential with the subject of the preceding clause (see §8.2).18
16 I have not tested the limits of these combinations. For example, what is the limit on the number of non-
     core functions that can occur within a clause? And is it possible to have the complete set of dative
     functions within the one clause? Consider, for example, 'I talked to the woman (indirect object) about
     language (complement) for money (adjunct)'.
17 Note that this discussion does not help to identify or define the properties of a subject in a verbless
     clause. There are often difficulties with formally identifying the subject in such clauses (e.g. see Morphy
     (1983) on Djapu). Verbless clauses are discussed in §7.I.
18 In a non-reduced adjoined clause, the subject can be identified from the auxiliary by (ii).
                                                        Parts of speech and other preliminaries   57OBJECT
  (i) Object NPs take the accusative case.
 (ii) First and second person objects are represented by a bound pronoun in the second
      position in the auxiliary. ('Third person objects are not registered in the auxiliary; see
      §5.2).
      The main-clause object is that which is co-referential with the (omitted) subject of a
      simultaneous non-finite subordinate clause in which the verb is inflected with the
      infinitive suffix -barda (see §8.1).
    Some ditransitive verbs subcategorise for two accusative objects, only one of which is
registered in the auxiliary (see §7.2). I thus make a distinction between direct objects, to
which the above three generalisations apply, and second objects, which are characterised by
(i), but not (ii) and (iii).
INDIRECT OBJECT
   The evidence for indirect object is considerably weaker than that for subject and object.
Indirect objects are marked with the dative case and are never represented in the auxiliary and
are thereby distinguished from subjects and objects. Indirect objects can be distinguished
from dative adjuncts and complements in that they are subcategorisable and semantically
unrestricted, and are thereby core functions. In addition, unlike other complements and
adjuncts, some indirect objects can feed reflexive and/or reciprocal constructions, in which
case the indirect object argument is registered on the auxiliary with the reflexive/reciprocal
pronoun (see examples (3-29) and (3-30)). As shown in (3-31) to (3-34), this is not possible
for dative adjuncts.

     *     This gender slot must agree with the gender of the possessed noun.
   There are no examples in the corpus in which case marking follows the genitive suffix,
although such constructions are accepted by speakers as grammatical. There are also no
examples in which a derivational suffix is followed by an adnominal suffix, although it is
conceivably possible in a word such as ?yugu-warli-ngunya `cry-AGNT.I-PROP.II(NOM)'
meaning `(woman) having a crying (child)'.
   Although there is not an example in which all of these slots are filled, the following few
examples attest to the above ordering and degree of complexity.
  ROOT + ADNOM + NUMBER + GENDER + CASE:
  (4-1) gijilulu-nguj-ball-nî-ni
        money-PROP-PL-I-LOC
        the men with money (ergative/locative)
  ROOT + DERIV + NUMBER + GENDER + CASE:
  (4-2) ngara-barli-marnda-nga-ni
        drink-AGNT-PL-II-LOC
        the women drunks (ergative/locative)
  ROOT + GENDER + GEN + GENDER:
  (4-3) bungma-nyi-niganka (maga)
        old.man I GEN.IV       (camp.w(NOM))
        the old man's (camp) (nominative)
   Some of the adnominal and number suffixes are inconsistent as to the form of the nominal
that they take as their stem. While most suffixes are attached to the root of the nominal, there
are some examples in which such suffixes take the citation form of the nominal, including the
gender suffix, as their stem. For example the number suffix -rdarra `GROUP' (see §4.3.3.4)
always follows gender marking, unlike the other plural suffixes which must precede gender
marking (see examples (4-1) and (4-2) above):    This template does not represent the structure of demonstratives or pronouns. These nominal subtypes
    are discussed in §4.6 and §4.8 respectively.
                                                   58
                                                                                            Nominals     59    (4-4) garngu-nva-rdarra
          many-II-GROUP(NOM)
          a big group (of women) (nominative)
   Other suffixes, such as the proprietive suffix, attach to the root of some nominals
(example (4-5)) and to the citation form of others (4-6). One possibility is that the root
functions as the stem when the gender of the 'base' nominal is unimportant, but that the
suffix follows the citation form when the gender of the underived noun is relevant. For
example, there may be alternative forms of (4-5) such as ala-jî-ngunya `child-I-PROP.II(NOM)''
meaning 'female with boy child' and ala-nga-ngunya `child-II-PROP.II(NOM)' meaning `female
with girl child'. However, this question will need to be followed up in the field.
    (4-5) alag-unya
          child-PROP.II(NOM)
          female with child
    (4-6) mangany-ma-ngunya2
          tucker-III-PROP.II(NOM)
          female with tucker
   These examples suggest that the above nominal template should include a provision in the
root slot for another optional gender marker, with the restriction that it is only filled in some
nominals that contain either the proprietive or privative suffix, or when the -rdarra number
suffix is present. The revised nominal word template would then be as follows:
    [Root (+gender)] + (deriv) + (adnom) + (number) + gender + ([Gen + gender]) + (case)
with the same conditions and abbreviations as given above.","[74, 75, 76, 77]"

   Wambaya is a non-Pama-Nyungan language originally spoken in the Barkly Tablelands
region of the Northern Territory, Australia. There are perhaps 8-10 fluent speakers
remaining, most of whom live in Tennant Creek and Elliott in the Northern Territory. The
linguistic work which led to this volume was initiated by the Wambaya community (through
the Gurungu Council Aboriginal Corporation in Elliott) out of an increasing concern for the
fate of their language as these few remaining speakers get older. It is hoped that this
(ongoing) work will help younger Wambaya speakers learn something of their language
now, and have some access to their language even when it is no longer being spoken around
them.
   While the main focus of this work has been on Wambaya, substantial reference has also
been made throughout the text to the mutually intelligible dialect Gudanji. The close and long-
term interaction between the Wambaya and Gudanji communities makes it virtually
impossible to work on one dialect without working on the other. Furthermore, the similarly
small number of remaining Gudanji speakers makes any work on this dialect equally urgent.
   The research for this grammar was conducted during six field trips, totalling over seven
months, from February 1991 to August 1994. Work was begun in Elliott, N.T., and then, as
many Elliott Wambaya moved to Tennant Creek, was continued there. There was a lot of
support for the project from the Wambaya/Gudanji people of both Elliott and Tennant Creek.
Although people were not always able to to help me with language material, help came in
many different forms: from helping with the elicitation and transcription of stories, to
providing access to computers and office space, to providing company for the many hours
spent driving between Elliott and Tennant Creek.
   This grammar is a revised version of my Melbourne University MA thesis (Nordlinger
1993a). The revisions include the reanalysis of some earlier analyses (e.g. the treatment of
complex clauses in Chapter 8), and the inclusion of new data collected since the MA thesis
was submitted (e.g. the causal suffix in §4.4.9). Unfortunately, the constraints of time have
made it impossible to cover all areas of Wambaya grammar in the same amount of detail.
Wambaya is a morphologically complex language, and thus these aspects of the grammar
have been given the most attention (Chapters 4-6); other areas have been given less coverage
than they deserve (e.g. complex sentences); and still others have been left out altogether (e.g.
prosody, discourse). Throughout the text I have indicated areas in which more work is
needed in the hope that it can be carried out in the future.
   This grammar is written as a reference grammar. I have therefore deliberately avoided
presenting the data in any particular theoretical framework, or devoting much discussion to
the interesting issues raised by aspects of Wambaya grammar for current theoretical research.
Instead I have tried to describe this interesting language in its own terms, using a substantial
number of naturally occurring examples and texts. My belief is that this will give the
grammatical description the best chance of standing the test of time, and readers the best
chance of discovering things in the language that I have not, perhaps even inspiring more
work on Wambaya before it is too late.                                               xi

4.4 NOMINAL CASE MORPHOLOGY
    The forms of the Wambaya case suffixes are given in Table 4.9. These suffixes occur with
all types of nominals except for singular demonstratives and free pronouns; these nominal
subtypes inflect slightly differently for case and are discussed in §4.6 and §4.8 respectively.
A detailed discussion of the functions of each case and any allomorphic variation follows the
table.
   Wambaya is a 'split-ergative' language: free pronouns have a nominative/accusative
system of case marking and all other nominals have an ergative/absolutive case-marking
system. Although there is no nominal which makes a three-way case-marking distinction,
24 It is worth noting, however, that all these examples are of verbless sentences in which the noun and the
      adjective belong to different NPs.
                                                                                      Nominals   81following Goddard (1982) the system as a whole can be seen to be tripartite on the basis of
the interaction between the two case-marking systems. Thus, there are three core cases: (i)
that for which the citation form of either a pronoun or an `other' nominal can be substituted
(S), (ii) that for which either the citation form of a pronoun or a marked `other' nominal can
be substituted (A) and (iii) that for which either a marked pronoun or the citation form of an
`other' nominal can be substituted (0). Following Goddard (1982) these cases will be referred
to as nominative, ergative and accusative respectively. As can be seen in the following table,
the ergative case marker in Wambaya also marks instrumental and locative case.

47 The high vowel of the Class I nominative/accusative stem is lowered before the remote suffix -ma. This
    is presumably attributable to vowel harmony. Similarly, when this stem is immediately followed by the
    dual suffix -wulu, the high front vowel of the stem becomes back, in harmony with the back vowels of
    the suffix. Thus: i-ni 'proximate singular nominative/accusative Class l' but i-nu-wulu 'proximate dual
    nominative/accusative Class t'..
48 Note that gender is not marked with the dual number suffix (see §4.3.2.1).
49
    This morpheme can be segmented into a root -guny- followed by the regular gender marking suffixes: -ji
    (1. ABS), -nyi O. NABS); -nya (II. ABS and NABS); -ma (III. ABS); -ja (IV. ABS). There is a regular
    morphophonemic rule which deletes one of two sequential identical consonants (i.e. -guny- `plural' +
    -nya `n (ABS)' > -gunya); see §2.3.5.

   For the purposes of simplicity however, I will not segment the demonstratives in the
examples in this description. Instead, I will give them in an unsegmented form and simply
indicate in the gloss the morphological structure. For example:
      naniyaga     that.ILSG.NOM, that.11.SG.ACC
      ninagawulija this.LDU.DAT
Other Demonstratives
   There are two other types of demonstratives found in the corpus: demonstratives in the
comitative case and possessive demonstratives. As there are only a few examples of each
type, I have chosen to discuss them separately, instead of including them in the tables and
discussion above.
(i) Demonstratives in the comitative case:
    In these examples, the regular comitative case suffix (-mbîli) replaces the ergative/locative
suffix in the ergative/locative form of the demonstrative. There are only two examples of this
type of demonstrative, both of which have plural number:
   (4-228) Mirrang-ba ng-u          ngankagunyambi!i/ninkigunyimbili.
           sit-FUT       I SG.S-FUT this.II.PL.COMIT/thi s.LPL.COMIT
           I'm going to sit down with these women/men.
   The fact that these demonstratives are based on the respective ergative/locative forms
suggests that what has been described as the ergative/locative stem may in fact be a more
general oblique stem. One argument against this, however, is the fact that it does not occur in
the dative forms.
(ii) Possessive demonstratives.
    These demonstratives are made up of a non-absolutive gender prefix agreeing with the
possessor, the nominative/accusative demonstrative stem -na-, the possessive suffix -gan-5o
(this suffix is also found on possessive pronouns — see §4.8) and a gender suffix agreeing
with the possessed noun. Thus, these demonstratives agree in gender with both the possessor
and the possessed. In the remote forms, the remote suffix -yaga occurs after the gender
suffix. The only examples of these demonstratives are in the nominative case, and have both
singular possessor and singular possessee nouns. A lot more work is needed in order to
obtain all the other forms of these demonstratives. Table 4.16 contains the forms that are
present in the corpus:
50 The fi nal nasal of this suffix is dropped before another apical nasal (such as in the Class It suffix -rna)
    and assimilates to the place of articulation of a following palatal or velar stop.
                                                                                             Nominals     115                               TABLE 4.16: POSSESSIVE DEMONSTRATIVES                                    POSSESSED NOUN

     Rem. Class I nî-na-gan-ji-yaga
     Rem. Class H nga-na-gan ji-yaga                 _
   The gender suffixes are regular and are the same as for possessive pronouns (see §4.8):
-.ii (I), -n is (II), -ma (III), -ga (P.0.51
   Some examples of these possessive demonstratives are:

           boy.I(NOM) that.II.SG.POSS.I(NOM)
           that woman's little boy
4.6.2 FUNCTION
  Demonstratives can be used as deictic determiners qualifying a noun (examples (4-233)
and (4-234)), or as deictic demonstrative pronouns alone in the NP (4-235) and (4-236).
   (4-233) Ngankiyaga      janya-ni   ngiyî-ng-a    dawu.
           that.II.SG.LOC dog.II-LOC 3SG.NM.A-I0-NF bite
           That (female) dog bit me.

   (4-235) Dagunta irri-ngg-a       inigunji.
           hit        3PL.A-RR-NF this.I.PL.NOM
           These ones are fighting.5 t The -ga which is found with the dative demonstratives (as in ninaga 'this.t.SG.DAT') is different from the
     -gan- which derives possessive pronouns and demonstratives (at least synchronically). This is shown by
     the fact that the final nasal found with the possessive suffix -gan- does not show up in the dative
     demonstrative suffix -ga, even when it is not word-final as in ni-na-ga-gunvi-nka 'this.I.PL.DAT'. If these
     two are the same suffix, it is difficult to explain why a nasal would appear in some circumstances and
     not in others.
52 This example is mysterious: it is not clear why the demonstrative is possessive, as the dreaming (see
     Appendix A, Text 4) is about the Peewee, rather than possessed by him.

             talk-AGNT.II(NOM) that.II.SG.NOM
             That woman's a chatterbox.
   In this function, the difference between the two types is very similar to the difference
between `this' and `that' in English. The proximate forms are usually used to refer to things
that are close to the speaker, while the remote forms are used for things that are further away
from the speaker. The proximate forms can also be used with a presentative function; similar
to the use of `here' in an English sentence such as `here's something interesting going on'.
Thus in the following example, taken from Text A.1, the fire is referred to with the
demonstrative yana despite the fact that it is a considerable distance from the speaker.
     (4-237) ""Ngangaba       yana              gi-n      trajbi.""
              fire.IV(NOM) this.IV.SG.NOM 3SG.S(PR)-PROG bum
             ""There's a fire burning (there).""
   Demonstratives also perform an important discourse function: they are used in the
organisation of information and tracking of reference. Demonstratives can be used to refer to
things previously mentioned or alluded to in discourse. The difference between the proximate
and remote demonstratives is metaphorically extended into this function. Proximate forms are
used when the antecedent or discourse topic is close (in terms of time of utterance) to the
utterance of the demonstrative (generally in either the same or preceding clause, but no more
than two clauses back):53

              There used to be a few houses. (Now) they've built lots of them.
   The following example is taken from Text 1 (Appendix A). In the clauses leading up to
this one, the two eaglehawks are telling their two sons that they should prepare a bed for the
two boys who have to leave early in the morning. Then there is one short sentence in which it
is said that the two eaglehawks pick up a round stone and a digging stick (by now all four
other characters are asleep) and:
     (4-240) Bunjunymi wurlu-n            inuwulu          wurlu-n   gulugbi.

             They sneak up on the two boys (who) are sleeping.
   When the thing being referred to was uttered more than a couple of clauses away, or if
there is another intervening discourse topic between the anaphoric element and its antecedant,
a remote demonstrative is used. The following sequence is taken from Text 6 (Appendix A).
The remote demonstrative refers to `the moon', mentioned a few clauses back. As there is an
intervening topic (indilyawurna), a remote demonstrative is used.","[131, 132, 133, 134]"
"
4.6 DEMONSTRATIVES
   Wambaya has a two-way system of demonstratives roughly comparable to this and that in
English. Like all nominal modifiers, demonstratives must agree with the noun that they
modify in terms of gender, number and case, thereby making the number of possible
demonstrative forms substantial. The two demonstratives each distinguish the four nominal
genders, three numbers (singular, dual, plural), and at least four cases (nominative,
accusative, ergative/locative and dative)42 although, as with most nominals, the nominative
and accusative case forms are homophonous. There are also a couple of examples of plural
demonstratives in the comitative case which are discussed later in the section. I have no
examples of demonstratives in either the allative or ablative cases. In the attempts to elicit
such demonstratives, locational nominals were used instead (as in `I'm going to (the) tree
there' instead of `I'm going to that tree'). There are also possessive demonstratives which
agree in gender with the possessed noun. These are discussed later in the section.
   It was said in the discussion of nominal case above that nominals have only one case
suffix which marks both the ergative and locative case functions (see §4.4.3). This appears to
be the case for demonstratives as well, although I have only one example of the same form
being used for both ergative and locative case functions:
     (4-226) Ngankagunyani irri-ng-a                       nyurrunyurru.
             this.II.PL.LOC    3PL.A-IO-NF                 chase
             Those (women) chased me.
     (4-227) Minn ng-u                 ngankagunyani.
               sit      I SG.S-FUT this.ILPL.LOC
               I'll sit with these women.
   There are no other examples of demonstratives occuring in locative NPs; locational
nominals are generally used instead. However, the above examples suggest that
demonstratives do not make a formal distinction between locative and ergative cases, so I will
therefore gloss ergative demonstratives as `LOC' on analogy with nominal case marking.
   The forms of the demonstratives in Wambaya are given in Table 4.14. These are discussed
in detail in §4.6.1, following the table. The function of these demonstratives is discussed in
§4.6.2.",[125]
"
4.3.3.4 -RDARRA `GROUP'
   As well as marking plural number, -rdarra expresses a notion of collectiveness and is
usually best translated into English with the phrases `all of' or `a/the group of'. This suffix
has just one allomorph which occurs with nominals of all genders. It is found only with
nouns and adjectives, and is suffixed to the full citation form of the nominal, following the
absolutive gender suffix. Unfortunately, all of the examples that I have of this suffix are in
either the nominative or the accusative case so it is not possible to tell whether case marking
follows or precedes -rdarra. For the purposes of this work I will assume that case marking
follows -rdarra, as it does with all other number suffixes.

   Hale's (1959) corpus contains examples in which a modifier is also inflected with -rdarra
in agreement with the noun in modifies (for example, p.39):24   (4-57) Yanagunja            darranggu-rdarra          maliwa-rdarra.
            this.IV.PL.NOM tree.IV-GROUP(NOM) big.IV-GROUP(NOM)
            These trees are big.
   Alternatively, an agreeing modifier can be inflected with a standard plural suffix (example
(4-58)) or appear in the unmarked number (4-59).
   (4-58) Iniyagunjî         yangaji-rdarra             maliyî-marndî.
            that.I.PL.NOM meat.I-GROUP(NOM) big-PL.I(NOM)

            These yams are good. (Hale 1959:51)
   This suffix can also be used with garnguj- to emphasise the fact that it is a big group:
   (4-60) Garnguji-rdarra              îrri-n             mîrra narunguji-nka.
            many.I-GROUP(NOM) 3PL.S(NP)-PROG sit                   car.IV-DAT

   (4-61) Yarru îrr-ajî        garngunya-rdarra.
          go     3PL.S-HAB.PST many.II-GROUP(NOM)
          A big group (of women) used to go.
   In Jingili rdarra is a free form that can be placed after a noun to mark plurality (Chadwick
1975:16). The fact that it is a free form in Jingili may explain why it follows gender marking
in Wambaya, rather than inflecting for gender itself (as number suffixes usually do).","[97, 98]"

   The non-singular possessive pronouns are derived by adding to the pronoun base the
possessive-deriving suffix -gan-, inflected for gender: ji/-nyi- `I ABS/NABS', -rna/-nga- `II
ABS/NABS', -ma 'III ABS' and -ga/-gi- Iv ABS/NABS'. The final nasal of the suffix -gan-
assimilates to the place of articulation of the following palatal or velar stop (i.e. with the Class
I and Class Iv suffixes), and is dropped before an alveolar or bilabial nasal (i.e. before the
Class II absolutive suffix and the Class III suffix).77
   In Wambaya, as in many Australian languages, there is a contrast between two types of
possession: alienable possession and inalienable possession. The possessive constructions
discussed so far in this work, in the discussion of possessive demonstratives (§4.6.1), the
genitive suffix (§4.4.10) and the possessive use of the dative suffix (§4.4.4), have all
involved alienable possession; cases in which the possessed item is considered separate and
detachable from the possessor. The nature of inalienable possession, on the other hand, is
that of a part-whole relationship; the two entities are considered to be inseparable such that
what is happening to one nominal (the 'part') is conceived of as simultaneously happening to
the other nominal (the 'whole') (see, for example, Hale (1981), McGregor (1985), Chappell
and McGregor (1989), Chappell and McGregor, eds (1995) for a discussion of inalienable
possession in both Australian languages and more generally). The semantic contrast between
these two construction types is shown in the following English examples:
      The dog bit me on the hand = The dog bit me (inalienable (or part—whole))
      The dog ate my dinner      #    The dog ate me (alienable)
   The dative and genitive suffixes and the possessive demonstratives can be used only in
constructions of alienable possession, which is also the most usual use of possessive
pronouns (see examples (4-292) to (4-295)). However, for purposes of emphasis (4-296) or
in verbless clauses (4-297), it is possible to use possessive pronouns in constructions of
inalienable possession.
  Some examples of the use of possessive pronouns follow. For a discussion of inalienable
possession see §4.9.",[147]

   The ergative/locative case suffix is used with a range of locative functions. The main
locative function is to indicate the place or location of an entity or an event. Thus, it expresses
a meaning usually expressed in English with the use of one of the prepositions such as `in',
`at' or `on'. If further specification is needed as to orientation (e.g. `under', `above') a
locational nominal such as jangi `down, below' or gayangga `high, up, above' can be
included (example (4-85)), although this is not obligatory (4-86). Some examples of the
ergative/locative case in this function follow. Note that in this function, the ergative/locative
suffix can be used in both transitive (4-82) and intransitive (4-83) sentences.

  The ergative/locative case is also used with time nominals:
   (4-87) Ngurraramba-ni ng-u               gulug-ba.
          night-LOC              ISG.S-FUT sleep-FUT

          I will come back next wet season.
   In the following example the use of the ergative/locative case expresses the duration of
time:

86 Chapter 4   The ergative/locative case can also be used to express a comitative meaning. Note that this
is possible despite the existence of a separate comitative case suffix (see §4.4.8). At this stage
of the investigation, it is not known what the difference in meaning is between the two
constructions.

           You'll go and sit with your daughter.
   In one example, the ergative/locative is used to indicate a locative source:
   (4-92) Damangga-ni gin-a             yidanyi namirra.
          head.IV-LOC      3SG.M-PST get         stone.IV(ACC)
          He took a stone out of (my) head.
   Like the dative and ablative suffixes (see §4.4.4 and §4.4.6 respectively), the ergative/
locative suffix can be used with verbs in non-finite subordinate clauses. This use of the suffix
indicates that the action/state described by the subordinate clause occurs simultaneously with
that referred to by the main clause, and that the subjects of the two clauses are co-referential.
One example is given below; for a more detailed discussion see §6.1.5 and §8.1.
   (4-93) Mirra ngirrî-n                  ngarli-ni.
           sit     1PL.EXC.S(NP)-PROG talk-LOC
           We're sitting talking.
   If a transitive subject NP is fronted it does not have ergative/locative case marking, but
appears in the nominative case. That the NP has been fronted in the following examples is
shown not only by the absence of case marking, but also by the position of the auxiliary,
which is in third, rather than second position in the clause (see §5.4 for a discussion of the
position of the auxiliary in the clause). Unfortunately, due to an absence of relevant
examples, it is not known whether other case-marked NPs also lose their case marking when
fronted, or whether this is simply a property of the ergative/locative case. Further
investigation is required.

4.4.4 DATIVE CASE
   The dative case is used in a large variety of functions. It marks the indirect object of
intransitive, semitransitive and some ditransitive verbs; the object of derived nominal
predicates; purpose; beneficiary; and oblique NPs marked in English with prepositions such
as `about' and `until' (as in `they're fighting', `I'll leave it until tomorrow'). The dative
suffix can also be used to mark possession, although there is also a separate genitive suffix
                                                                                        Nominals     87(see §4.4.10). A derive NP is never represented in the auxiliary. Thus, indirect objects of
semitransitive verbs are not represented:
  (4-96) Yandu ngi           ngarringa-nka gujiga-nka.
         wait ISG.S(PR) ISG.POSS.II-DAT mother.II-DAT
         I'm waiting for my mother.
  (4-97) Ayanî     g-a       nganga.
         look.for 3SG.S-PST 2SG.OBL
         He looked for you.
a) Form
   The major allomorph of the dative suffix is -nka. This can also be pronounced [raga], with
the initial nasal having assimilated to the place of articulation of the following velar stop.29
For the use of -nka see examples (4-96) and (4-97) above and (4-102) and following below.
   The other two dative allomorphs are found only after the dual number suffix. Of these,
-ja is the most common and is clearly related to the irregular ergative/locative allomorph ji
that is also conditioned by the dual suffix: both of these irregular suffixes replace the initial
nasal or nasal + stop of the regular suffix with the palatal stop /j/. The other allomorph that
occurs with the dual suffix, -janka, appears to be a combination of -ja and the regular dative
allomorph -nka. Both -ja and -janka occur in free variation. Some examples of each
allomorph follow.
  (4-98)     Yanybi ng-a          marnugujama            bungmaj-bull ja.
             get      ISG.A-PST conkerberry.III(ACC) old.person-DU-DAT

   (4-100) Angbard-a gurl       baba-wuli-janka ngaba wurlu               gulug-ba.
           build-FUT DU.IMP sibling-DU-DAT           THEN    3DU.S(NP)    sleep-FUT

           eat    3DU.A(NP) finish        child-DU-DAT
           They eat all (the food) for the two children.
b) Function
i) Indirect Object
    The dative case is used to mark the indirect object of semitransitive verbs (example (4-
102)); the indirect object that occurs optionally with some intransitive verbs (4-103); the
indirect object of some ditransitive verbs (4-104) (other ditransitive verbs have two absolutive
objects — see §7.2.6); and the optional indirect object of some transitive verbs (4-1051. For a
detailed discussion of the argument structures of Wambaya verbs and a list of verbs
belonging to each type, see §7.2.","[102, 103, 104, 105]"

1.1.2 WIDER RELATIONSHIPS
   As they are among the southernmost non-Pama-Nyungan languages, the West Barkly
languages are surrounded on two sides by Pama-Nyungan languages to which they are
clearly not genetically related: Wagaya and Warumungu in the south and the Ngumpin
languages in the west. Although the non-Pama-Nyungan languages Alawa and Wardaman are
adjacent to the West Barkly languages to the north, there is no apparent genetic relationship
with these languages either. Nor is there any obvious genetic relationship between the West
Barkly languages and Garrwa and Waanyi which lie immediately to the east; although striking
similarities in verbal inflections (see §6.1) suggest a history of contact and influence between
these two language groups (see also I. Green 1995). Thus, the West Barkly languages are
not (closely) related to any of the languages that border them.
   Dixon (1980:225) claimed Jingili (and by implication all of the West Barkly languages) to
be one of two languages (the other being Tiwi) which could not be genetically linked to other
Australian languages at all. However, comparative work done by Chadwick (e.g. 1984) has
shown that the West Barkly languages are related to the Jaminjungan languages (Jaminjung
(Cleverly 1968), Ngaliwuru (Bolt et al. 197la) and Nungali (Bolt et al. 197lb)), located in
the west of the Northern Territory, towards the West Australian border9 (see Map 1). This
relationship is interesting as the West Barkly languages and the Jaminjungan languages are
physically non-contiguous; they are geographically separated by the Ngumpin languages.
   There is (at least) one major typological difference between the Jaminjungan languages and
the West Barkly languages: the West Barkly languages are `suffixing' (employing suffixes
rather than prefixes) and the Jaminjungan languages are `prefixing' (employing both suffixes
and prefixes). However, many of the prefixes found in the Jaminjungan languages
correspond with suffixes in languages of the West Barkly group (see Appendix B). The
existence of residual prefixes in certain lexical items and grammatical elements in West Barkly
languages (such as the gender prefixes in Wambaya demonstratives and the pronominal
elements in the auxiliary), which correspond to prefixes found in Jaminjungan languages is
strong evidence that the West Barkly languages were originally prefixing and have since
become suffixing (see I. Green 1995 for detailed discussion).
   The most striking similarities between the Jaminjungan and the West Barkly languages, as
identified by Chadwick (e.g.1984), are found among the pronouns (both bound and free) and
the gender affixes (at least in Nungali, the only Jaminjungan language with a gender
system). l
°   The similarities, at least within the dialects of the McArthur language, are such that it can generally be
    assumed that much of what is said for Wambaya will be at least similar if not the same for Binhinka and
    Gudanji. The only major areas of difference between these dialects are the auxiliary (particularly the
    tense/aspect/mood marking) and the forms of the demonstratives (see Appendix C and §4.6 respectively).
    This group of languages, containing the West Barkly and Jaminjungan languages, is known as the
    Mirndi group after their shared innovative first person dual inclusive pronouns.
10 The following discussion is based on information contained in Chadwick (1978, 1979 and 1984).
                                                                 The language and its speakers   Among the pronouns there is a large degree of similarity in the function and form of
regular pronouns, as well as irregularities in the system which are common to all of the
languages. One example of this is the first person dual inclusive pronoun which has a base of
the form mind(i) or mirnd(î) in all the languages, and has been adopted as the name for the
whole group. Examples of other similarities among free pronouns include the form of second
person singular free pronouns:
     nanti            Jaminjung and Ngaliwuru
     naminju          Nungali
     nanuthiyama      Jingili
     nyami            Gudanji and Binbinka
     nyamirniji       Wambaya
and the form of the suffix that occurs on dual and plural non-subject free pronouns:
     -ag       Jaminjung           (e.g. mindag IDU.INC.OBL)
     -agu      Jingili             (e.g. mîndagu IDUJNC.OBL)
     -(a)ga    Ngarnga and Gudanji (e.g. mîrndaga IDU.INC.OBL)
  Among the bound pronouns, an example of similarity is the third person singular
masculine transitive subject forms:
     gan-     Jaminjung an d Ngaliwuru (used for feminine too)
     ngan-    Nungali
     gani-    Gudanji (present tense)
     gînî-    Wambaya
   A significant degree of similarity also exists between Nungali and the West Barkly
languages in the area of gender and gender marking. All of these languages have four
genders, marked by suffix in the West Barkly languages, and by prefix in Nungali. In all
languages there is a distinction made among gender affixes according to case. In the Eastern
Group of the West Barkly languages this is a two-way distinction between absolutive gender
affixes which appear in the nominative and accusative cases, and those which appear in all
other cases, followed by regular nominal case suffixes. In Jingili and Nungali, however,
there is a three-way distinction among gender suffixes: absolutive, ergative and dative.
Unlike in Wambaya, the ergative an d dative gender suffixes in Jingili and Nungali are not
supplemented with regular nominal case affixes. There is a significant degree of
correspondence in both form and function between the gender suffixes of Nungali and the
West Barkly languages. This is discussed in Appendix B.","[22, 23]"
"81    Although, as pointed out by Chappell and McGregor (1989:28), constructions of inalienable possession
      encode not so much a part-whole relation, but rather one in which two entities are seen to be inextricably
      linked. See also Hale (1981). McGregor (1985) and Chappell and McGregor, eds (1995) for a discussion
      of inalienability and part—whole relations in other languages.
                                                                                           Nominals     135Inalienable possession in Wambaya is most commonly used with body parts (4-323) to (4-
325), but is also used with other entities such as tracks (example (4-326)) and names (4-
327).
   As mentioned above, the construction of inalienable possession differs from that of
alienable possession in that the two nominals are simply juxtaposed without any special
morphological marking. These two constructions also differ in the way that they are
registered in the auxiliary. In alienable constructions, it is the possessed noun (the head of the
phrase) which is registered in the auxiliary. In inalienable const ructions, however, it is the
'possessor' nominal which is registered. This difference is shown in the following two
examples, of which the first is an alienable construction and the second is one of inalienable
possession.
   (4-322) Dagwna ng-a           ngangi         janjî.
           hit        ISG.A-PST 2SG.POSS.I(ACC) dog.I(ACC)
           I hit your dog.
   (4-323) Nyamî ngî-ny-a                daguma labîrra.
             2SG.ACC ISGA-20-NF hit              hand.IV(ACC)
             I hit your hand.
    If the inalienable construction is considered to be made up of 2 NPs: one which contains
the `possessor' nominal and bears the grammatical relation, and another which contains the
`possessed' entity and is a complement of the first NP, then this difference in the cross-
referencing behaviour of the two possessive constructions is easily explained. Under this
analysis it is simply the head of the NP bearing the grammatical relation which is registered:
janji 'dog' (I) in example (4-322) and nyami `you.ACC' in (4-323). The nominal labîrra in (4-
323) cannot be registered as it belongs to a NP which does not bear the grammatical relation
(but is simply a complement); and the possessor nominal in (4-322) cannot be registered as it
is not the head of the NP in which it occurs.82
   The behaviour of inalienable constructions in reflexive/reciprocal clauses also suppo rts the
analysis that treats the `possessed' entity as a complement to the 'possessor' NP. Usually a
reflexive/reciprocal construction contains no overt object NP, only the reflexive/reciprocal
bound pronoun in the auxiliary. However, in constructions of inalienable possession, it is
possible to have an overt NP representing the object:
   (4-324) Langanjardi j-ba ngu-ngg-u                  jartga.
             hang.up-TH-FUT I SG.A-RR-FUT foot.IV(NOM)
             I'll put my feet up (on the back of the chair).
   This suggests that the overt NP, here janga, is not the object (as the object is represented

3.1.1.1 NOMINALS
(i) and (ii) Nouns and Adjectives
    For the most part, adjectives and nouns in Wambaya can be considered the same. In this
respect, Wambaya is typical of Australian languages, in which there is generally little formal
distinction between nouns and adjectives (Dixon 1980:272). Both nouns and adjectives are
inflected for case, number and gender, can function as the head of a noun phrase or as a
modifier qualifying the head; and can function as the predicate of a verbless clause (see §7.1).
   However, there are differences between nouns and adjectives that support the treatment of
them as two different subclasses even though they are both contained within the larger
superordinate class of nominals. These differences are semantic, morphological and
syntactic.
   Semantically, nouns typically denote objects and entities while adjectives typically denote
attributes. Furthermore, while nouns inherently belong to only one gender (or at most two, in
the case of some animate and plant nouns), an adjective has no inherent gender, but
potentially can be marked for any of the four genders in agreement with the noun that it
modifies (or in the case of an adjective functioning as the head of the phrase, in agreement
with the referent). For example:
      bugayî     alaji               big boy (I)
      bugayirna bayigina             big bag (II)
      buguwama jigama                big yam (III)
      buguwa     darranggu           big stick (IV)
   Morphologically, most of the inflectional suffixes are identical for both nouns and
adjectives. However there is at least one difference, again concerning gender: while Class IV
(the neuter gender) is generally not marked on nouns, it is marked on some adjectives by
either -a, -ga or -ja:4
Nouns:
    balamurru        spear (1V)
    wunba            wind (IV)
    barrawu          house (1v)
Adjectives:
     gurijb-a   good-Iv
     murrgun-ga three-IV
     bagi-ga    bad-Iv
     garngu-ja  many-IV
  Note that this is simply a difference in the form of the marking, not in the number of
gender possibilities for nouns and adjectives, which is exactly the same.
   The difference between the semantics of nouns and adjectives also leads to different
derivational possibilities. For example, the derivational suffix -mî, which can be attached to a
nominal X to derive a factitive verb with the meaning `cause to be X, make X' is found only
4   However with most adjectives, as with nouns, Class iv is not overtly marked (see §4.2.2).
48     Chapter 3
with adjectives, not with nouns. Thus, gurijbî `good' can become guriny-mi `make good,
make better', but a noun such as juwa `man' cannot become *juwamî `make into a man' .5
    Syntactically, while it is possible for nouns to function as modifiers of the head noun, as
in bungmaji barnanggi `old man barnanggi'6 and lagurra jurutna `deep/sunken stomach'
(literally `hole stomach'), this is relatively unusual and it is significantly more common for
adjectives to have this function.
   Thus, while there are many reasons for considering nouns and adjectives to be members
of the same superordinate word class of nominals, there is adequate justification for
considering them to be different subclasses of nominals, thereby allowing for them to behave
and be treated slightly differently with respect to certain features of the grammar.
   There is a slight structural difference for two adjectives, bagij(b)i `bad, no good (I)' and
gurijbi `good (I)', depending on whether they have a `subjective' (or experiential) meaning or
an `objective' (or evaluative) meaning. When the adjective occurs as the predicate in a
verbless construction (as in examples (3-1) and (3-3)) the meaning must be objective. If the
meaning is to be subjective, then the adjective must occur in a verbal construction, usually
with either the verb manku `hear, feel' (3-2) or the verb mirra `sit' (3-4).7
     (3-1)   Bagijbi     inî            janji.

           good:II(NOM) 1SG.S(PR)-PROG sit
           I (female) feel good.
    However, it is possible for a verbal construction, with mirra, to have an objective reading
if, for example, the verbal construction is needed for the specification of non-present tense
(see §7.1.7): .

objective meaning.","[64, 65, 66]"

4.4.3 ERGATIVE/LOCATIVE/INSTRUMENTAL CASE
   There is one case that covers all of the ergative, locative an d instrumental functions. This
case suffix is consistently glossed `LOC' and is referred to in discussion as the `ergative/
locative' case. `LOC' has been chosen to gloss this case suffix as the locative function seems
more semantically basic: extensions of locative to instrumental (e.g. in Pitjantjatjara (Blake
1977:44)) and of instrumental to ergative (e.g. in Kune (Nick Evans, pers. comm.)) are
widely attested, but it seems more unlikely that an ergative suffix would have been extended
to cover locative functions 25 Although there is formally just one case, the ergative, locative
and instrumental functions can be distinguished from each other on functional and syntactic
grounds. This is discussed in more detail below.26
25  Note, however, that this is purely speculative. Further investigation is required in order to substantiate
    this claim for Wambaya.
26 The Jaminjungan languages also have one case morpheme which covers all three of ergative, locative and
     instrumental functions (Hoddinott and Kofod 1976:397). In Ngaliwuru and Jaminjung the basic form is
     the same as in Wambaya: -ni. In Nungali, in which the situation is a little more complicated, the most
    common ergative/locative case markers are either the prefix nyi- or the suffix -ni (Hoddinott and Kofod
     1976:397).
     Wagaya, a language spoken immediately to the south-east of Wambaya, also has one form which is used
     for ergative, instrumental and locative cases (Breen 1976:340), although this suffix (-1. -g or -dy) is very
                                                                                           Nominais     83   The following examples demonstrate the use of the one ergative/locative case marker in all
three case functions:
   (4-67) Janmajardi wurlu-ng-a darranggu-wuli-ji.

          I'm sitting on top of two sticks.
a) Form
   The ergative/locative suffix has 4 allomorphs with -ni being the basic, general form. Of the
other three allomorphs one is phonologically conditioned (-nu) and two are morphologically
conditioned, occurring in very restricted environments.
   The allomorph -nu follows u-final stems. Its occurrence is optional in this environment; it
is equally as acceptable to use the regular form -ni:
  (4-70) Ngabulu-nu ngiyi-ng-agba     dawu murlu.
         milk ry-LOC 3SG.NM.A-IO-HYP bite eye.IV(ACC)
         The sap might sting my eyes.

         stick.ry-LOC     3SG.NM.A- I O-NF scratch
         The stick scratched me.
   The ergative/locative suffix -ji is found only after the dual suffix. There does not seem to
be any phonological motivation for the irregular form of this suffix. Examples include (4-67)
to (4-69) above, and the following:
  (4-72) Bungmaj-bull jî    wurl-aji           daguma juwarramba.
         old.person-DU-LOC 3DU.A-HAB.PST hit            men.I(ACC)
         The old women had been killing all the men.
  (4-73) Barraala                 dunkala      wurlu-n        baba-wuli-ji.
         white.cockatoo.11(ACC) chase.away 3DU.A(NP)-PROD sibling-Du-LOC
         The two brothers are disturbing the white cockatoos.    different in form from the Wambaya suffix. And in Warumungu (spoken immediately to the south of
    Wambaya) the ergative case marks instrumental and locative functions (Heath and Simpson 1982:20).
    However, as Jane Simpson points out (pers.comm.), the coalescence in these languages is probably due
    to a collapse of forms rather than the development of one case marker out of another: in Warumungu,
    complete vowel assimilation causes the collapse of ngka 'LOC' and -ngki, -ngku 'ERG'; and in Wakaya,
    the neutralisation of the case distinction was brought about by final vowel loss.
    Chadwick (1976:393) suggests that in an earlier stage of the West Barkly languages, nouns may not have
    been marked for ergative function and that the modern ergative (/locative) case suffixes may have
    developed from a gender marker of a third person element in the noun phrase. The fact that -ni is also a
    common Class I non-absolutive gender suffix in Wambaya may lend some support to this theory, as
    does the fact that both Jingili (Chadwick 1975:16-17) and Nungali (Bolt, Hoddinott and Kofod 197I b:68-
    69) have portmanteau forms that mark both gender and case. While Wamhaya makes a distinction in the
    gender suffixes between absolutive case and non-absolutive case, in Wambaya, unlike in Jingili and
    Nungali, it is necessary also to affix a separate case suffix to these gender suffixes.
84 Chapter 4   Two non-absolutive gender suffixes found only with certain kinship nouns condition an
irregular ergative/locative allomorph -yi. These are the Class I non-absolutive suffix -na and
the Class II non-absolutive suffix -ga.27 Some examples are:28
   (4-74) Guguga-yi ngîy-a           wugbardî ngarra.

            MB.I-LOC 3SG.M.A-PST.TWD bring
            Uncle brought him.
   In all other environments -nî is the only ergative/locative allomorph that occurs.
b) Function
   The ergative/locative case covers a large range of functions: from marking the subject of a
transitive clause to marking the location of an event. The distinction between ergative,
locative and instrumental functions can be made on functional and syntactic grounds. The
ergative function always marks the subject of a transitive or ditransitive verb; the instrumental
function marks an instrument; and the locative function marks the location or position of an
entity or event. Syntactically, a NP in the ergative function is always represented in the
auxiliary with a bound pronoun, while a NP in either the locative or instrumental functions is
never represented in the auxiliary. The locative function can be distinguished from the
instrumental function on the basis of co-occurrence restrictions: a NP in the locative function
can include locational nominals such as jangi `down' (example (4-85)) and can be replaced
with locative demonstratives such as gîliyaga `there', while a NP in the instrumental function
can not.
   The ergative function marks the subject of transitive and ditransitive verbs. An example of
each is given below.
   (4-76) Gujîga-yi      gurlaganga-ni ngiyi-ny-a      gurla   yagu.

=mijî expresses possibility, rather than probability, and is more like the English modal
'might'.

           Perhaps they're cooking. (In response to an inquiry as to some people's
           whereabouts.)
   The clitic =miji is often used with indefinite/interrogatives in their indefinite function, in
which they indicate a lack of knowledge without asking that the information be supplied. This
function is discussed and exemplified more fully in §4.7. Examples include:
   (7-189) Gayinirna=miji       nayida             ng-u       yany-ba agardi-nka.

          somehow=LNFER 3PL.S-PST drown many.I-GROUP(NOM)
          Somehow they all drowned (but I don't know how).
   In the only example in the corpus where =mijî is not encliticised to the initial element in the

   (7-191) Darrgulumî îrr-a        ngarra    banjangani gayinini-ni=miji.

           Someone must have let the water out behind me.
   The use of =miji with indefinites is similar to that of the particle /pangkal/ `might be, may
be' in Warumungu, which is used to create indefinites from interrogatives (Jane Simpson
pers.comm.). It is also similar to the use of the ignorative clitic =ga in Ngiyambaa
(Donaldson 1980:258ff).27 Note that 'might be' can be used in Aboriginal English in the
same way: Where is X? Might be somewhere.28
73.1.2 =-- NIMA 'JUST'
   The clitic =nima is a restricted clitic that has a number of related emphatic functions,
translating English words such as 'just', 'only' and 'still'. It is most commonly used with
nouns and adjectives, but can also be used with other parts of speech such as verbs (example27 However, the clitic =ga in Ngiyambaa has a different meaning than =miji in wamhaya. as its use with
    other word classes is inferred to be a request for the hearer to affirm or deny the correctness of the
    statement (Donaldson 1980:260). The use of =miji has no such implicature.

gilî `here' and the remote suffix -yaga (this suffix is found on most remote demonstratives;
see §4.6).

    The different uses of =nima are related by the fact that they all se rve to modify
presupposed expectations; the clitic functions as an expectation modifier (McConvell 1983),
highlighting deviation from a presupposition that something more or different would be
expected. In example (7-192), for instance, =nima denies the presupposition that the speaker
would have been given both meat and bread; in (7-195), it denies an expectation that the
travellers would have arrived at their destination already; and in (7-199) the function of =nima
is to deny the presupposition that the speaker went anywhere else. The 'counter-expectation'
meaning of (7-198) is not so obvious. However, this utterance was given in a context in
which the speaker was complaining about the fact that people always come and ask her for

only, and not for anyone else' s 29
7.7.1.3 =MINY/ `AGAIN'
   The clitic -minyi `AGAIN' is used only with verbs. It is attached to the verb over which it
has scope. There are only a few examples of this clitic in the corpus, including:
     (7-200) Bardgu-j-ba=minyi g-u        galyurrungurna.
             fall-TH-FUT=AGAIN 3SG.S-FUT rain.II(NOM)

             sleep-DAT=AGAIN 3SG.S(PR)-PROG cry
             He's crying to go back to sleep (i.e. because he's tired).
   As can be seen in the examples above, =minyî can be used with either of the two senses
that McConvell (1983) identi fies for English `again': (i) repetition of an action or situation
and (ii) return to a former position or state. In example (7-200) =minyi indicates repetition of
the full situation: it is true that the event of raining will be repeated. In (7-201) and (7-202) on
the other hand, =minyi indicates only a return to a former state or position, rather than a
repetition of the whole event. Thus (7-202), for example, means that `he' was asleep before
and that he is crying in order to return to that former state of sleeping. It does not mean that
the event of his crying has happened before and is now being repeated. Similarly, (7-201)
describes the situation in which `she' was here and will return to this former position. It does
not refer to a repetition of the event of returning.","[222, 223, 224, 225]"

ii) Object argument of derived nominal predicates
    The dative suffix is used to mark the object argument(s) of nominal predicates derived
from verbs with suffixes such as the agentive (4-106) and the proprietive (4-107).
   (4-106) Nanîyaga            jîya-j-barlirna           danya-nka     (ngurla).

           You'll come back for money.
   The dative suffix can also be used with verbs to indicate purpose or intended action (see
§6.1.4 and §8.1 for a more detailed discussion of the use of the dative suffix with verbs).
   (4-110) Ngankagunyani îrri-ng-a      nyurrunyurru daguma-ji-nka.

          You'll take it for the white man.
v) `about'
   The dative case is used in Wambaya to express meanings that would be expressed in
English by the preposition `about'. In these examples the dative case is being used to indicate
the reason or cause for the action/event.
  (4-114) Didbidbunga ngirri-ngg-a-n             gijîlulu-nka bungmanya-nka.
          argue.with    IPL.EXC.A-RR-NF-PROG money.IV-DAT old.woman.II-DAT

          be.ashamed 1SG.A-RR-NF big.IV-DAT trousers.IV-DAT
          I'm embarrassed about his big trousers.
vi) `until'
   The dative case is used with some time nominals to express the meaning of `until':
  (4-117) Gulug-ba gurl        ngijininima-nka.
          sleep-FUT DU.IMP tomorrow-DAT
          Sleep (here) until tomorrow.
  (4-118) Yagu ng-a                marndiji-nka.
          leave 1 SG.A-PST later-DAT
          I left (it) until later.
vii) Possession
   The dative suffix is often used to indicate possession, despite the fact that there is a
separate genitive suffix (see §4.4.10). In this function, the dative suffix is affixed to the
possessor.
   (4-119) Alangi-nka yana               jalyu.
           boy.I-DAT      this.IV.SG.NOM bed.IV(NOM)
           This is the boy's bed.
   (4-120) Ngarlwi ngî         ngarringa-nka guguga-nka ngarlana.
           talk      ISG.S(PR) 1SG.POSS.II-DAT MM.II-DAT language.IV(ACC)
           I speak my grandmother's language.
   The case of the possessive phrase is marked only on the head noun; case suffixes do not
attach to the dative suffix. While this is also the case in examples such as (4-119) above, it is
demonstrated more clearly when the possessive phrase is in a non-zero-marked case:
   (4-121) Mirra ngi             gujînganjanga-mbili          alangi-nka.
           sit       1SG.S(PR) mother.II-COMIT                boy.I-DAT
           I'm sitting with the boy's mother.

             sit     1SG.S(PR) bed.IV-LOC old.man.I-DAT
             I'm sitting on the old man's bed.
   Note that the genitive suffix is also usually not followed by case suffixes (see §4.4.10).
vii) Animate location
   The dative suffix can be used to mark animate location or goal (although the allative suffix
is more commonly used with this function; see §4.4.5).
   (4-123) Yarru ngurlu-n                 ginki garngunyi-nka.
           go     1DU.EXC.S(NP)-PROG there many.I-DAT

     This sentence is rather odd. Firstly, gulugardi usually requires a reflexive bound pronoun in this context;
     secondly, I would have expected the locative case suffix on the adjunct NP, instead of the aliative.
                                                APPENDIX B               COMPARATIVE DISCUSSION OF GENDER MARKING   In this section I will discuss gender marking in the other Mimdi languages/dialects, and
consider the ways in which it relates to gender marking in Wambaya (see §4.2.2 for a full
discussion of gender marking in Wambaya). The languages/dialects considered are Gudanji,
Binbinka, Ngarnga, Jingili (all information from Chadwick 1978) and Nungali (from Bolt,
Hoddinott and Kofod 1971 b). The other two Mimdi languages, Ngaliwuru and Jaminjung,
do not have a gender system.
   There are a lot of similarities among the gender-marking systems of these languages, and
gender marking is one of the areas on which the genetic relationship between the West Barkly
languages and the Jaminjungan languages was initially established (e.g. Chadwick 1984:iii).
The gender affixes of each of the Mirndi languages that have a gender system are given in
Tables B 1 to B4.1 As the gender marking on nominals is essentially the same among the
dialects of the McArthur Language (Wambaya, Binbinka and Gudanji), I have included only
the list for Wambaya in the following tables. The only difference in gender marking among
these dialects is in the demonstratives, where Binbinka has slightly different prefixes. The
Binbinka demonstrative prefixes are included in Table Bl.
   Note that gender is marked by prefix in Nungali, as opposed to the West Barkly
languages, in which it is marked by suffix (except in the Eastern Group demonstratives). A
further point to note is that both Jingili and Nungali have two sets of non-absolutive affixes:
one which is used in the ergative and/or locative case and one which is used in the dative
case. The other West Barkly languages, however, have only one non-absolutive form.","[275, 276]"

4.5.2.1 AGENTIVE NOMINALISER
  The agentive suffix is added to a verb X to derive a nominal with the meaning `one
who/which does X' or `one who does a lot of X'. It is added to either the verb root or the verb41    This is the only morphological process in the language that appears to be sensitive to discourse topic.
                                                                                  Nominais    105 root plus thematic consonant, depending on the conjugation class of the verb (see §6.1). The
agentive suffix must show gender agreement with the referent of the derived nominal and
each gender form has two phonologically conditioned allomorphs: the initial bilabial stop is
lenited to /w/ following a vowel or a lateral consonant (see §2.3.1 for a discussion of
lenition). The different absolutive gender forms of the agentive suffix are given in Table
4.12. There are no Class III forms in the corpus.
            TABLE 4.12: ABSOLUTIVE GENDER FORMS OF THE AGENTIVE SUFFIX

                     Class IV           -warla              -barla
   The non-absolutive Class I and II forms are -barlinî-/-warlini- and -barlînga-/-warlînga-
respectively. There are no examples in the corpus of a Class IV agentive noun inflected for
case. The base form of the suffix which is used as the stem for the addition of number
suffixes is -barli-/-warli-. The agentive suffix takes the -marnda- plural suffix:
   (4-219) yugu-lumi j-barli-marndarna
            cry-CADS-TH-AGNT-PL.II(NOM)
            women who make (him) cry (re a group of drunken women who scared a baby)
  This suffix is extremely productive and common. An agentive noun has normal nominal
possibilities: it can be used as a nominal predicate (example (4-220)); as the head of a NP (4-
221) and (4-222) or as a modifier (4-223).

          I hit that `biting' dog. (given as a translation for `I hit the dog that bit me')
   An agentive nominal derived from a transitive, semitransitive or ditransitive verb can take a
dative complement expressing what would be the object in a normal verbal clause. This is
only possible when the nominal functions as a predicate. The subject in these constructions
takes the nominative case:
  (4-224) Ngawurniji alîyulu j-barlirna          mayinanyi-nka.
          1 SG.NOM      find-TH-AGNT.II(NOM) goanna.I-DAT

            She always gives (us) clothes.
   Note that this dative complement is optional. It is present only if the speaker wants to
indicate specifically what the object of the action is. The two examples above could also occur
without the complement, in which case they would mean `I (always) find (things)' and `She
always gives (us) (things)', respectively.","[122, 123, 124]"
"
4.2 GENDER
   Nouns in Wambaya are divided into four grammatical genders3 (or noun classes), marked
by suffix. All nominal modifiers must agree with the gender of the noun that they modify
although, unlike nouns, they have no inherent gender of their own. This section discusses the
different genders in general, and also deals with the gender marking that occurs with most
nominals. The marking of gender on some nominals such as demonstratives and pronouns,
to the extent that they differ from the marking of gender discussed here, is dealt with in the
sections that discuss these modifiers (§4.6 and §4.8 respectively).
   The four genders are divided into two animate and two inanimate genders, which are then
further divided as follows:
     This is an example of gender stacking. In this, nominal gender is marked twice: the inner gender suffix
     has scope over the 'base' nominal (mangany- 'tucker') and the outer gender suffix has scope over the
     whole derived nominal. Another example of gender stacking in Wambaya is in the possessive
     demonstrative forms (see §4.6.1). Gender stacking has also been discussed for Bantu (e.g. Mel'tuk (no
     date)).
3    The use of this term, for what have more traditionally been referred to as noun classes, follows Corbett
     (1991).
60 Chapter 4      A. Animate
          I. Masculine                       II. Feminine
      B. Inanimate
           III. Vegetable/Non-flesh food     Iv. Residue/Neuter
   In the following discussion, these will be glossed and referred to as Classes I, II, III and W
respectively.
   The principles of gender assignment are primarily semantic, as the above labelling
indicates. However, as with most noun-classifying systems, a certain amount of gender
assignment seems arbitrary; perhaps being explained by cultural and/or mythological
considerations. The assignment of gender is considered in more detail in §4.2.1.
   The gender system in Wambaya makes a distinction between `absolutive' and `non-
absolutive' gender suffixes. The `absolutive' suffix appears in the nominative and accusative
cases and in the citation form of the noun, and the `non-absolutive' suffix appears in all other
cases, that is before a non-zero case suffix. The most common gender suffixes are given in
Table 4.1 (see Table 4.3 for a full list). A more detailed discussion of gender marking is
found in §4.2.2.

4.2.1 GENDER ASSIGNMENT
   (a) Animate classes
    The membership of Classes I and II is semantically based according to the following
criteria:
  (i) All nouns with animate referents belong to one of these two classes. There are no
      animate nouns that belong to either of Classes III or Iv.
 (ii) All nouns referring to male humans belong to Class I and all nouns referring to female
      humans belong to Class II.
 (iii) Where a gender distinction is made for non-human animate nouns, the noun with the
       male referent will belong to Class I and the one with the female referent will belong to
       Class II.
                                                                                          Nominals     61   Many human nouns have two forms: one belonging to each animate class. As (iii)
suggests, this is true for some non-human animate nouns also. Some examples are:
      Class I                                   Class II
      bungmaji        old man                   bungmanya           old woman
      alajî           boy                       alkmga              girl
      marndaji        white man                 marndanga           white woman
      abajabaji       crazy person (male)       abajabajirnta       crazy person (female)
      marunki         male countryman           marunkîrna          female countryman
      ngarrînybi      male friend               ngarrinybirna       female friend
      janjî           male dog                                      female dog
                                                janya
      galalaninji     male dog                  galalarrinya        female dog
  Most non-human animate nouns, however, have a `fixed' gender; they are classified
consistently as either Class I or Class n regardless of sex. Whether there are cultural and/or
mythological explanations for the classification of such animals or whether the choice is
semantically arbitrary is unknown. Some examples are:
     Class I                             Class II
     garrgalyi       plains lizard       gulangunya        blue-tongue lizard
     mîmarri         snake (generic)     bubuyirna         children's python
     mamanggî        snail               majigina          crab
     gululyi         maggot              mugunjana         louse
     barnanggi       bird sp.            wirrilgarra       cockatiel
   It is worth noting that the terms for `wild honey' or `sugarbag' are included in the animate
classes, and a distinction is made according to `gender'.5 These terms do not seem to refer to
the bees themselves; warnnganji `fly' (I) is used instead.
      wawunji boy sugarbag (I)
      wawunya girl sugarbag (II)
   While all animate nouns have either Class I or Class II gender, not all nouns of either Class
I or Class II gender are animate. There is a `leak' (Corbett 1991:13) from the semantic residue
or neuter gender (Class Iv) into Classes I and II. Most of these inanimate nouns refer to
natural events or celestial bodies:
    In the case of the non-human nouns, although both gender forms are possible, the Class II form is more
    marked, and it is the Class I form which is used with general reference, or if the gender is unknown or
    unimportant
5   I asked why it is that one type is considered male and the other female and was told only that the male
    type is found high up in a tree and the female type is found on the ground. Although this explains how
     the two types differ, it does not provide any insight into the gender classification.
62     Chapter 4       Class I                      Class II
       galyurringi       water      galyurrungurna rain

       jinkijî           star
       ngurujî           cloud
  Others are nouns such as juguli `boomerang' (I), ginguli `hook' (I), bayigina `bag' (ri) and
mudinya `needle, injection' (II).
  There are a few body-pa rt terms that belong to Class I. These are ngarninji `body',
marlanganji `shoulder', garlimbaji `rib-bone', wurdalyi `ankle', and ilîrri `blood'. All other
body-part terms belong to the inanimate classes.
   There is one example in the corpus of two synonyms having different genders: the two
words for `meat' — yangaji and gunju — belong to Classes I and Iv respectively. This is
shown by the following examples:7
     (4-7)   Yangaji          inî              bagijbi.
             meat.I(NOM) this.I.SG.NOM bad.I(NOM)
             This meat is no good.
     (4-8)   Bagiga           yana               gunju.
             bad.IV(NOM) this.IV.SG.NOM meat.IV(NOM)
             This meat is no good.
(b) Inanimate classes
   All of the inanimate nouns apart from the small number discussed above belong to either
Class m or Class Iv. There are no animate nouns which are members of either of these
classes. The assignment of nouns to these two genders is primarily semantically based, to an
even greater extent than for the animate classes. Class III is made up largely of nouns
referring to non-flesh food such as fruits and bread.8 Some examples are:
       manganyma              tucker, bread
       burnarîngma            wild orange
       jigama                 wild yam
       ngamandurruma          wild banana
   Certain body-part nouns also have Class III gender (the others are members of either Class
I or Class Iv). The majority of Class III body-part nouns seem to have in common the fact that
their shape is of a rounded nature:
6     It is a common feature of all of the West Barkly languages that the word for 'rain' is the feminine form
      of the word for 'water'. Compare:
                  Class I             Class n
             J    ibilga water        ibilgirni     rain (Chadwick 1975:123)
             Ng nguwi water           nguwirna rain (Chadwick 1971:39)
             GB nguwi water           nguwirna rain (Chadwick 1978:382, 387)
7     Yangaji is the most commonly used synonym; gunju is heard much less frequently. Gunju may have
      been borrowed from Nungali (in which it means 'body' (Bolt et al. 1971a:143)). It is possible that gunju
      has been assigned to Class iv on the basis of its form (Class I nouns are almost always /i/ final, while
      Class iv nouns are generally either /a/ or /u/ final; see §4.2.2).
8     Note however that the terms referring to 'wild honey' belong to the animate classes (see above) and
      marrgulu 'egg' has Class tv gender. Otherwise all nouns referring to non-flesh foods belong to Class In.
                                                                                Nominals   63      bunyma           arse
      jarndama         chin, beard
      mabuluma         navel
      gaknna           nose
      luranyma         testicles
      juruma           stomach
      gandaniyama      kneecap
   For others this characteristic is not so obvious:
      banjanganima tail
      banduma       back
      birnmanma     throat
   However, some nouns referring to body parts with a rounded shape do not belong to
Class III, such as ngabulu `breast' (IV).
   Class III also contains the nouns gagama and ngangma, both meaning `faeces, shit'.
   Class IV is the semantic residue class; it contains all of the nouns whose gender is not
assigned on the basis of a positive semantic criterion (Corbett 1991:13). Therefore, Class iv
contains all the inanimate nouns that have not already been mentioned in the discussion of the
membership of other genders. For example, all terms referring to and related to non-edible
plants, rocks, features of the landscape, fire, most tools, language, European objects and so
on belong to Class iv. Some examples are:
     darranggu     tree
     ilyirrga      leaf
     murlurru      turpentine tree
     namîrra       stone
     maga          country, camp
     ngangaba      fire
     balamurru     spear
     ngarfana      language
     danva         clothes
     narunguja     car, vehicle
   There are two examples in the corpus of plants with two forms: one for the fruit
(belonging to Class III) and one for the tree (belonging to Class IV):
     burnaringma      wild orange (fruit) (HI)     burnariga  wild orange (tree) (IV)
     marnugujama      conkerberry (fruit) (III)    marnuguja  conkerberry (tree) (IV)
  For all other fruit trees I was given the same term that is used to refer to the fruit (and
which therefore belongs to Class III).
  Table 4.2 gives a brief description of the types of nouns that belong to each gender:

feminine and `moon' often masculine; `echidna' is commonly feminine as is `emu', and
`faeces, shit' commonly belongs to the vegetable class. For discussions of noun classification
in other Australian languages see Dixon (1972, 1982), Harvey (no date) and Evans (1995c).

  This section covers the marking of gender on nouns and their modifiers in Wambaya. See
Appendix B for a comparative discussion of gender marking in the languages of the Mirndi
group.
   Class III is the only gender which has a single suffix that is consistently present on all
members of the gender. For other genders there are a number of different suffixes, both
phonologically and lexically determined, so that it is not always possible to tell from the form
of the noun what its gender suffix is. Table 4.3 lists all the gender suffixes found on nouns
and their modifiers. The conditioning environments of phonologically conditioned
allomorphs are given in the table. Suffixes in smaller font are less common and are found
with only a small number of forms.9

"77   This suffix is also used to derive possessive demonstratives. However, in the one example of a Class III
     possessive demonstrative in the corpus the alveolar nasal of the possessive-deriving suffix is retained
     before the bilabial nasal of the Class III gender suffix: nganaganma `this.11.SG.POSS.111.NOM/ACC.
     Simpson (1990) notes the similarity between the -ga accusative/oblique element in. Wambaya, and an
     inversion marker in Warumungu -ngki or -ngku. As well as having a slight similarity of form, these two
     morphemes are similar in occurring with non-singular accusative pronouns and possessive pronouns
     (although whether the form that occurs with possessive pronouns in Wambaya is the same as that on
     accusati ve/oblique pronouns is unclear, see the discussion in §4.6). However, the Warumungu morpheme
     has an additional function of marking inversion of subject and object bound pronouns that the Wambaya
     element does not have.

   It is very common for an oblique pronoun to be used in a context where a possessive
pronoun would usually be expected. The examples of this are all in constructions of alienable
possession. Some examples are:

   The fact that oblique pronouns can be used in possessive constructions parallels the
common use of the dative case with nominals in genitive phrases, instead of the genitive
suffix (see §4.4.4 and §4.4.10).","[147, 148]"

    An interesting feature of this system of verbal marking, however, is that the infinitive
suffix -barda can also be used in prior clauses (example (8-14)) and purposive clauses ((8-
15), (8-16)), in which the subjects of the two clauses are co-referential. (Due to lack of data it
is not possible to determine if -barda can also be used in these types of clauses when it is the
main clause object that is the pivot). Thus, it is only when the two clauses are simultaneous6     The examples are so few that it is not possible to tell whether the non-finite clause in this case is a
      complement of the verb, or an adjunct.
7     This is the Gudanji form of the auxiliary.
8     Note that the NP Binbinka is not inflected with the dative case, as objects of purposive clauses usually
      are. This is probably ruled out for phonological reasons, since the dative suffix is identical to the final
      syllable of the NP and would yield Binbinka-nka.
                                                                      Syntax of complex sentences    215that the infinitive suffix is restricted to different subject marking. Note that the object NP in a
purposive clause still must be in the dative case, even if the verb is marked with the infinitive
suffix (8-16).

   Austin (198 lb) shows switch-reference to be an areal feature in Australia; languages
which have some sort of switch-reference system are spoken in a continuous area, extending
from the Indian Ocean through to western Queensland (p.329). As Wambaya falls within this
area, it is therefore predictable that it would have some form of switch-reference. In fact the
switch-reference system in Wambaya is typical for languages of the area in that the
e gative/locative_ suffix is used to mark same subject, and there is no switch-reference in
purposive clauses. The switch-reference systems of surrounding languages such as Jingili,
Garrwa, Wagaya and Alyawarra also have these characteristics (Austin 1981b:326-328).
However, the Wambaya switch-reference system differs from those of these surrounding
languages in that the infinitive case suffix, rather than the allative case suffix, is used to mark
different subject.
   As in the majority of examples above, the usual case is for the non-finite clause to follow
the main clause. However, it may also appear initially, preceding the auxiliary (examples (8-
17), (8-18), see also (8-1) above), and may even appear embedded within the main clause
((8-19) to (8-22)). The only examples of this latter possibility is when the subordinate clause
contains only a verb;9 and in all these examples the subordinate clause is followed
immediately by the controlling NP in the main clause.1 o

v    Although examples such as (8-19) to (8-22) are found in spontaneous speech, speakers do not generally
     accept them as grammatical when presented with them out of context. Thus, it is difficult to get
     judgements on whether such embedding is also possible with more complex non-finite subordinate
     clauses (i.e. those containing object NPs) since speakers generally judge all embedded examples to be
     ungrammatical.

   In other Australian languages such as Warlpiri (Simpson 1988, 1991) and Kayardild
(Evans 1995a), the verb in clauses such as these is marked with a derivational nominalising
suffix; thus non-finite subordinate clauses in these languages are clearly NPs. In Wambaya,
however, the category of these clauses is less clear. Like NPs, non-finite subordinate clauses
can be inflected with nominal case suffixes; and they can appear embedded within the main
clause (example (8-22)) or before the auxiliary (8-17) — two positions that are available to
NPs, but not to finite clauses. However, there is no nominalising suffix; the subordinating
suffix is attached directly to the verb stem. Furthermore, unlike other derived nominals, non-
finite subordinate clauses do not have to agree in case with the head noun that they modify
and nor are they marked for gender. The situation is made more complex by the fact that
different non-finite subordinate clauses have different characteristics. Simultaneous
subordinate clauses, for example, also differ from derived NPs in that they do not assign
dative case to their object NPs; and they cannot function as predicates in verbless clauses.
Purposive non-finite subordinate clauses, on the other hand, do have both of these
properties, and thus appear to be `more nominal' in their behaviour.) ""
8.1.1 SENTENTIAL CAUSATIVES
  There are two examples of sentential causatives in the corpus. Both examples contain
purposive non-finite subordinate clauses.

   There are a number of interesting comparisons that can be made between the gender-
marking systems of the Mirndi languages. Firstly, there is a large amount of consistency,
particularly in Classes II and III. For example, the form nga occurs as a non-absolutive Class
It marker in all languages, on both nouns and demonstratives. And all languages but Jingili
have either nya or rna or both as a Class II absolutive marker (note that this nya turns up in
Jingili as the `gender base' in the Class II demonstrative; see above). Jingili is interesting in
this respect as the Class II nominal absolutive suffixes all have final /i/, whereas Class II in all
of the other languages is consistently marked with /a/, Class I being marked with /i/.
   Class m is consistently marked with ma or mi (as in Jingili) in the absolutive. It is
interesting that both Wambaya and Nungali have ma in the absolutive and mi in the non-
absolutive, while in Jingili this is reversed, mi being absolutive and ma non-absolutive.?
   Other interesting correspondences are the Class I non-absolutive suffixes -nî in the Eastern
Group languages, and -(r)nî in Jingili; and -nyi in the Eastern Group languages and the
ergative/locative/instrumental prefix nyî- in Nungali. The rare Class I non-absolutive
Wambaya suffix -di is the same as the Class I absolutive prefix di- in Nungali.
   The Class II non-absolutive suffix -ga, which is restricted to some kin terms in Wambaya
and Ngarnga, shows up as a more general Class II non-absolutive suffix in Jingili and as part
of the Class II dative prefix in Nungali. In fact the correspondence between the Wambaya and6     From Bolt, Hoddinott and Kofod (1971b:63, 68-69, 75-76, 89-90).
7     Note that prefixes such as ma-, mi- and m- are very common in all non-Pama-Nyungan languages
      marking a class which refers to non-flesh food, probably deriving from an earlier generic noun mayi (see
      Dixon 1980:273).
                                                    Comparative discussion of gender marking    263the Nungali Class II non-absolutive forms is very neat: Nungali has nganyi-, nyanyi- (ERG)
and ganyi- (DAT) and Wambaya has -nga, -nya and -ga.
   There is also a certain degree of similarity among the Class Iv markers. The Class Iv
suffix -ga found with some adjectives in Wambaya, is found as a prefix on Class Iv
demonstratives in Binbinka, and is similar to the Class Iv dative prefixes in Nungali (gi-, gu-)
and the gender base in the Class Iv demonstrative in Jingili: gu-. An original prefix gu- has
been retained in at least two Class iv Wambaya words: gurdurlu `heart' and guyiga `fire',
which are cognate with Nungali dulu and -yug respectively (Bolt, Hoddinott and Kofod
(1971b:143, 145)).
   Table B5 contains the gender markers for each language that appear to have
correspondences in one or more of the other languages. In this table many distinctions made
in the more detailed tables above have been collapsed (such as the distinction between
ergative and dative non-absolutive forms in Jingili and Nungali). A question mark indicates
that the form is not known and a gap indicates that there is no correspondence in that
category. For the Binbinka dialect, only the demonstratives' gender markers have been
included; all other markers can be assumed to be the same as for Wambaya.

2.3 MORPHOPHONEMICS
2.3.1 LENITION
   The initial /b/ of a suffix will always lenite to /w/ when it is added to a vowel-final stem, or
to a stem ending in /rll or /rr/. Compare:
        ngaj-barlî          see-AGNT (I) BUT yugu-warli      cry-AGNT (I)
        gulug-ba            sleep-FUT    BUT ngarl-wa        talk-FUT
        jany-baji           dog-PRIV (I) BUT darranggu-waji stick-PRIV (I)
        bungmaj-bulu        old.man-DU BUT lagija-wulu       coolaman-DU
        and-bi              call.out-NF BUT ngirr-wi                    growl-NF28
   In fast or casual speech this lenition can also occur within morphemes, particularly if the
bilabial stop follows /g/, or if it is in a reduplicated syllable:
        -agba           HYP            -agwa
        wugbardi        cook         — wugwardî
        bardibardî      poor bugger — bardiwardi
   There are also a couple of examples in which /j/ lenites to /y/. This occurs in reduplications
(see §2.3.6 for a discussion of reduplication):
        junmi cut >           junmi-yunmi RDP-cut
and with the causitive suffix -jirrimi after a vowel-final stem:
        gannga+jirrimi        return+CAUS >          gannga-yirrimi
     See §6.2.1.1 for a discussion of this suffix.
     The retroflex stop /rd/ (written d word-initially) lenites to In in reduplication:
        daguma       hit > dagu-raguma            RDP-hit
This lenition is optional before /g/ intramorphemically:
        bardgu fall ~ bargu
28 It seems likely that this lenition would also occur after other liquids, given that it occurs after /rl/ and
       Irr/; however, there are no relevant examples in the corpus.
                                                                   Phonetics and phonology    392.3.2 ELISION
   When two identical vowels a re separated by a semivowel, the semivowel may be elided,
resulting in a phonetic long vowel (this process is discussed in more detail in §2.1.4 above).
This can occur both within and across morpheme boundaries.
     darranggu-wulu tree-DU        > /darranggu-ulu/           rdarat)gu ,ulu]
     ngara-waji     drink-PRIV (I) > /ngara-aji/               Nap ,aiji]
     baraj-bulu     old.person-DU > /baaj-bulu/                ['baaii,bulu]
2.3.3 EPENTHESIS
   Epenthesis is one the strategies used when the concatenation of two different morphemes
results in an illicit consonan t cluster (see §2.3.5 for a full discussion). Thus, as /ni cannot
occur as the second member in a conson an t cluster (see §2.2.3 for a discussion of
permissible consonant clusters), an epenthetic vowel /ii is inserted between a consonant-final
stem and any suffix beginning with /n/. The examples in the corpus all involve verbs and the
suffixes -nka 'DAT', -nî `LOC' and -nnga `ABL' (see §6.1 for a discussion of verbal
morphology).
      mawula-j- + -nka       > mawula-j-i-nka         play-TH-EP-DAT
      gulug- + -nka          > gulug-i-nka            sleep-EP-DAT
      ngirra-j- + -nî        > ngirra j-i-ni          steal-TH-EP-LOC
      ngarl- + -ni           > ngarl-i-ni             talk-EP-LOC
      alalangmî j- + nnga    > alalangmi-j-i-nnga     hunt-TH-EP-ABL
    In examples in this work I will generally not segment this epenthetic vowel, but will group
it with the preceding morpheme (e.g. mawula-jî-nka, gulugî-nka).
   There is one example in the corpus in which lui is the epenthetic vowel. This example
involves the addition of the allative suffix -nmanji to a placename Junggurragurr `Tennant
Creek'. This placename has been borrowed from Warumungu and does not fit Wambaya
phonotactic constraints (by ending in a consonant), hence the need for an epenthetic vowel.
      Junggurragurr+ -nmanji > Junggurragurr-u-nmanji              Tennant.Creek-EP-ALL
2.3.4 ASSIMILATION
2.3.4.1 /w/ > /y/
   An intervocalic /w/ will assimilate to /y/ if it follows the high front vowel Iii. This process
affects the dual suffix -bulu/wulu and the privative suffix -baji/waji.
      /juguli-wulu/ > /juguliyulu/ rjuguli-, julu] boomerang-DU
      fuguli-waji/ > /juguliyaji/ r juguli-, jaijil boomerang-PRiv (I)
   This means that a morpheme which has an initial /b/ underlyingly can be realised with a /y/
(I will use orthography here for clarity):
      juguli + bulu > jugulî-wulu > juguli-yulu
   Thus, an initial /b/ lenites to /w/ intervocalically (see §2.3.1), and then the /w/ assimilates
to the 'frontness' and height of the preceding /i/, becoming /y/.
40     Chapter 22.3.4.2 OF STOPS BEFORE Im/
   When a root having a final stop is followed by a suffix beginning with the bilabial /m/, the
stop assimilates to a nasal. The examples of this involve the Class III gender suffix -ma and
the factitive suffix -mi:
       garnguj-     many        + -ma Class III > garngunyma many.III
       burnarîg-    wild.orange + -ma Class III > burnarîngma wild.orange.11l
       gurij-       good        + -mi FAC       > gurinymi    good.FAC
2.3.4.3 VOWEL HARMONY
   Unlike Jingili, Wambaya does not have many instances of vowel harmony. While the
process of vowel harmony in Jingili affects many nouns and most verbs (Chadwick
1975:10), systematic vowel harmony in Wambaya is only really found within the auxiliary,
although there are a couple of marginal instances restricted to specific morphemes.
  The ergative/locative suffix, usually -ni, has an allomorph -nu when the stem has final /u/.
The use of this allomorph is not obligatory; the two allomorphs are in free variation in this
environment. Some examples are:
     (2-9)   Mîrra ngurru               manjungu-nu/manjungu-ni.
             sit 1PL.INC.S(NP)          shade.IV-LOC
             We'll sit in the shade.
     (2-10) Daguma rig-a             darranggu-nu/darranggu-ni.
            hit        1SG.A-PST stick.IV-LOC
            I hit him/her/it with a stick.
The other morpheme which is affected by processes of vowel harmony is the suffix -barli
`AGNT'. The final vowel of this suffix can optionally be assimilated to /a/ with the addition of
the feminine suffix -rna .
        Daguma j-barlirna/daguma j-barlarna           hit-TH-AGNT.II     A discussion of this suffix is provided in §4.5.2.1.
   The vowel harmony in the auxiliary is triggered usually by the high vowels /u/ and /i/ and
affects any preceding high vowels. (There are no examples with preceding /a/ that would
allow us to determine whether it would also be affected by vowel harmony.)
   There are two types of vowel harmony in the Wambaya auxiliary: regressive and
progressive. Regressive vowel harmony involves the singular and the first person dual
inclusive subject bound pronouns (this set of pronouns will be termed `minimal'; see
§5.1.2). The underlying forms of these bound pronouns are as follows:29
        ngi     ISG.S/A
        nyi     2SG.S/A
        gi      3SG.S
        ginî    3SG.M.A
        ngîyi   3SG.NM.A
        mirndi 1DU.INC.S/A29 See Chapter 5 for a full discussion of the auxiliary, the bound pronouns and related affixes.
                                                                       Phonetics and phonology   41   The past tense suffix -a replaces the final vowel of the stem, but does not affect the
preceding Iii of the disyllabic stems:
      gin-a   3SG.M.A-PST
      ngîy-a  3SG.NM.A-PST
      mirnd-a I DU.INC.S/A-PST
  Nor does it affect the vowel(s) of the subject bound pronoun when it is added to an
auxiliary containing an object bound pronoun (in this case the suffix marks non-future tense):
      ngi-ny-a I SGA-20-NF
      nyi-ng-a 2SG.A-IO-NF
      gini-ng-a 3SG.M.A-10-NF
      ngiyi-ny-a 3SG.NM.A-20-NF
   However, when the future tense suffix -u is added any preceding vowels within the
auxiliary assimilate to the back vowel:
      ngu-ny-u   ISG.A-20-FUT
      nyu-ng-u   2SG.A-10-FUT
      gunu-ngg-u 3SG.M.A-RR-FUT
      nguyu-ny-u 3SG.NM.A-20-FUT
      murnd-u .  1DU:INC.S/A-FUT
   Any suffix with initial /u/ will also trigger this vowel harmony:
      ngu-ny-uda 1SG.A-20-NACT.PST
      murnd-uba I DU.INC.S/A-NP.AWY
   The habitual non-past suffix -ala provides the only example of /a/ triggering vowel
harmony:
     nga-ngg-ala     I SG.A-RR-HAB.NP
     gana-ng-ala     3SG.M.A-10-HAB.NP
     ngay-ala        3SG.NM.A-HAB.NP
   In the above examples a lu/ in a tense/aspect/mood/directional suffix triggers regressive
vowel harmony affecting the subject (and object) bound pronouns that precede it. However,
the situation concerning the non-minimal subject bound pronouns (i.e. all other non-singular
subject bound pronouns, see §5.1.2) is exactly the opposite. In the case of these bound
pronouns, it is the high vowel of the subject bound pronoun that triggers progressive vowel
harmony, affecting any high vowels in the following tense/aspect/mood/directional suffixes.
  Each of the non-minimal forms is disyllabic and has the same vowel in each syllable. The
underlying forms of the non-minimal subject bound pronouns are as follows:
     ngurlu I DU.EXC.S/A
     ngurru 1 PL.INC.S/A
     ngirri 1PL.EXC.S/A
     gurlu 2DU.S/A
     girri   2PL.S/A
     wurlu 3DU.S/A
     îrri    3PL.S/A
42    Chapter 2   Consider the following examples, in which suffixes that were triggering regressive vowel
harmony in the discussion of the minimal subject pronouns above are themselves affected by
progressive vowel harmony triggered by the vowel(s) in the non-minimal subject bound
pronoun.
    ngurlu-ny-u IDU.EXC.A-20-FUT
BUT ngirri-ny-i   1PL.EXC.A-20-FUT
    gurl-uba            2DU.S/A-NP.AWY
BUT îrr-iba             3PL.S/A-NP.AWY
    wurlu-ngg-u 3DU.A-RR-FUT
BUT girri-ngg-i 2PL.A-RR-FUT
   The habitual non-past suffix also does not trigger vowel harmony with these subjects,
although it is not affected by vowel harmony itself:
      îrr-ala      3PL.S/A-HAB.NP
      girri-ng-ala 2PL.A-1 O-HAB.NP
2.3.5 REDUCTION OF NON-PERMISSIBLE CLUSTERS
    There are three different strategies employed in Wambaya to deal with the situation in
which a morphological process creates a non-permissible consonant cluster. (i) epenthesis,
(ii) assimilation of the first consonant to the other, (iii) deletion of the final consonant of the
stem. Of these, the first two were discussed in §2.3.3 and §2.3.4.2 respectively. In this
section I discuss the cases in which the stem-final consonant is deleted.
   The deletion of the stem-final consonant is the usual strategy whenever the addition of a
suffix to a consonant-final stem results in an illicit consonant cluster.30 This is the case if the
two consonants are different:
      alag-    child      +              -ji      Class I > alaji                  boy.I
      alag-    child      +              -nga     Class II > alanga .              gir1.II
      bungmaj- old.person +              -nyi-    Class I > bungmanyi-             old.man.I
      murrgun- three      +              -ma      Class II > murrgurna             three.II
or if the two consonants are identical:
      bungmaj-      old.person +         -ji      Class I > bungmaji             old.man.I
      -gun y-       PL         +         -nya     Class II > -gunya              PL.II
   There are two examples in which a consonant-initial suffix is added to a stem with a final
consonant cluster, thereby creating a triconsonantal cluster. In both of these examples it
remains the final consonant of the stem — the middle consonant of the cluster — which is
deleted:
      wawunyg- sugarbag + -ji              Class I    > wawunji             sugarbag.i
      ginganj- drown + -bi                 Non-future > ginganbi            drown330 There are two exceptions to this: (i) when the suffix is one of -ni `LOC', -nka 'DAT' or -nnga `ABL' and
    the stem is a verb an epenthetic vowel /i/ is inserted (see §2.3.3); and (ii) when the suffix begins with
    /m/ a preceding stem-final stop assimilates to the corresponding nasal (see §2.3.4.2).
                                                                               Phonetics and phonology       432.3.6 REDUPLICATION
    Reduplication in Wambaya is found mainly with verbs, with which it is used to indicate
iterative or durative aspect, or the intensity of the state described by the verb (see §6.1.7). It
is also used with a few nouns, usually marking plurality (see §4.5.3). With neither of these
word classes, however, does reduplication seem to be a regular and productive process,
being relatively uncommon and found only with a limited number of forms. Although
Wambaya is a suffixing language, reduplication generally occurs to the left; that is, the
reduplicated element is attached as a prefix. There are two main patterns of reduplication in
Wambaya, found with both verbs and nouns. At this stage of the investigation, it is not clear
what determines which reduplication pattern a particular form will follow: there are no
obvious phonological or morphological properties which characterise the two classes of
roots. Clearly, more research is required.
   The most common reduplication pattern copies (to the left) the first two syllables of the
word (or the whole word if disyllabic). In the following examples, syllable boundaries are
indicated by a period.32
     ngaj.bi             see              > ngaj.bi-ngaj.bi                        look around
     la ja:rri           light fire       > la ja-la ja.rri                        light fire (DUR)
     ngun.ju.lu          carry            > ngun.ju-ngun.ju.lu                     carry (DUR)
     nya.gaj.bi          be tired         > nya.ga-nya.gaj.bi                      be very tired33
     lung.gany.mi        make cheeky      > lung.gu34-lung.gany.mi                 make very cheeky
     la.barn.ga          branch (of tree) > la.ba-rla.barn.ga                      branch (of tree)
   If the first and second syllables of the word are identical, then only one syllable is copied:
       nya.nya.yu move around > nya-nya.nya.yu move around repeatedly
       di.di.ja   carry       > dî-dî.dî.ja    carry (DUR)
   If the word has an initial stop, this will often lenite to a glide in reduplicated forms. Thus,
/rd/ (written d initially) lenites to Id, r/ lenites to /y/ and /b/ lenites to /w/. There are no
examples of lenition of the velar stop /g/.
       da.gu.ma hit                  >              da.gu.-ra.gu.ma          keep hitting
       du.rra   be   frightened (of) >              du.rra.-ru.rra           be very frightened
       jun.mi   cut                  >              jun.mi.-yun.mi           keep cutting
       bard.gu  fall                 >              bard.gu.-ward.gu         keep falling
   The second main reduplication pattern in Wambaya is slightly more interesting as the
reduplicated part at first appears to be infixed, and does not constitute a single prosodic unit,
31 It is interesting that it is the alveolar nasal, rather than the palatal nasal, which appears in this form.
    This suggests that it is the alveolar nasal that is present before the palatal stop in the root (usually only
    the palatal nasal occurs in this position).
32 The glosses for the reduplicated forms given here are those that the form had in the context in which it
    was given. It is possible that a form may also have other meanings in other contexts. For example,
    lajalajarri may be able to have both a durative meaning such as 'spend some time lighting a fire' and an
    iterative meaning such as 'light many fires'.
33 Note that in this example, as in the two following, it appears that the final consonant of the second
    syllable has not been copied in the reduplicand. However, since in all cases this would result in an illicit
    consonant cluster, meaning that this consonant would be deleted (see §2.3.5), it is not possible to tell
    whether it has simply been copied and then deleted, or not copied at all.
34 Note that this vowel seems to have assimilated to those on either side of it.
44      Chapter 2
consisting of the rhyme of the first syllable and the onset of the second. This type of
reduplication process has been noted in other Australian languages, such as Warumungu
(Simpson 1992), Mangarayi (Merlan 1982) and Jingili (Chadwick 1975). Some examples of
this type of reduplication are:
        banymi      pass by        > banymanymî         keep passing by
        angbardi    build          > angbangbardi       build repeatedly
        bundurrijbî get full       > bundundurrijbi     get very full
        bungmaji    old man        > bungtnungmajî      old men
   Following accounts by McCarthy and Prince (1986:47) for Mangarayi we can account for
this reduplication process in the following way.
     (i) The initial consonant of the base word is considered extramelodic (i.e. it is detached
         from the base but is still available for copying).
 (ii) Attach the template of one syllable as a prefix to the base.
 (iii) Given a copy of the base, satisfy the syllable to the fullest.
 (iv) According to the universal Onset Rule, copy the initial consonant of the second syllable
      of the base as the onset of the second syllable of the reduplicated form.
  Thus, if we apply this account to the Wambaya examples, the derivation of a form such as
banymanymi is as follows:
           6        a
        (b)any mi                        A
               (b)any mi
        banymî      (b)any mî
iv. a            + 6           a
        banymi (b)any mi
   In a form such as angbardi there is no initial consonant to be extramelodic, but the rest of
the derivation remains the same:
i.        a a       a        ang ba rdi
                                                                    Phonetics and phonology   45ii.      a+       a                 a
                  g       La rî                 ,‘ u
        angbardi wig ba rdi
iv.       a+          a
        angbardi ang ba rdi
      In one Wambaya form, the template appears to be two syllables, rather than one syllable:
        garriji   `be cold' >       gamjarriji
i.      a a a         \N N
        (g)a m fl
ii.     a a + a a a                               N.   N           if         (g)a      m jt
        gamji (g)a ni ji
iv. a a + a a a        1\4-'1 N N
     gamft (g)a m Jt
  Although these two reduplication patterns account for most of the reduplicated forms in
Wambaya, there are a few other forms which are reduplicated in slightly different ways. In a
couple of examples the reduplicated form is derived by copying the last two syllables of the
word to the right:
        ya.rru.bu.rdu        walk around > ya.rru.bu.rdu-bu.rdu   keep walking around
        garr.ga.lyi          plains lizard > garr.ga.lyî-ga.lyî   plains lizard
Some other reduplicated forms (of nouns) appear to be unpredictable:
        alaji    boy > alajaji          boys
        iligirra river > ililirri       rivers
                                              CHAPTER 3              PARTS OF SPEECH AND OTHER PRELIMINARIES3.1 PARTS OF SPEECH
   There are seven parts of speech (or `word classes') in Wambaya, determined by the
inflectional and distributional characteristics of each word. These classes are mutually
exclusive:1 each root belongs to only one word class, although with the use of derivational
suffixes, it is possible for a root to move its membership from one word class to another.
These derivational suffixes are discussed in §4.5.2 (verb to nominal) and §6.2.2 (nominal to
verb). The seven parts of speech in Wambaya are:
     (1)     NOMINALS
               (i) nouns
              (ii) adjectives
             (iii) free pronouns
             (iv) demonstratives
              (v) locational nominals
             (vi) temporal nominals
            (vii) indefinite/interrogatives
      (2)    VERBS
      (3)    AUXILIARY
      (4)    ADVERBS
      (5)    PARTICLES
      (6)    CLITICS
      (7)    INTERJECTIONS
   Of these seven word classes, the two largest and most important are the open classes of
verbs and nominals. These two classes have quite distinct morphological and syntactic
characteristics. Nominals generally inflect for gender, number and case and usually function
as the arguments of the clause.2 Verbs on the other hand are inflected for tense, co-occur with
the auxiliary and typically function as the predicate of the clause. Both classes also have
different derivational possibilities. Although word-class membership is determined primarily
on grammatical and functional grounds such as these, it is also possible to characterise the
difference between these two word classes on semantic grounds: verbs typically describe
states, actions and events, and nominals usually denote entities, objects and attributes.3
   In the following discussion I divide the word classes into `inflecting' (nominals, verbs and
the auxiliary) and `non-inflecting' (adverbs, particles, clitics and interjections).","[56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64]"

   My greatest debt is to the Wambaya people who welcomed me into their community and
taught me, so patiently, what I know of their language. In particular I would like to thank my
friends and language teachers, Molly Nurlanyma Grueman, Minnie Niyamarrama Nimara,
Mavis Bangarinya Hogan and Powder Bangarinji O'Keefe (Gudanji) for their never-ending
cooperation, tolerance and patience. They cheerfully shared with me their language and their
stories, answered my questions, and corrected my mistakes. For their support and friendship
I would also like to thank many other people from Elliott and Tennant Creek, including:
Florine Bathern, Ivy Duncan, Amy and Jeffrey Dixon, Billy Hayes, Sandra Hogan, Judy
Holt, Ian Hopwood, Michael Neade, Penny Watson, Heather Wilson and Oscar Wilson; all
of the people who participated in the Wambaya literacy workshop in Tennant Creek in April
1993; and, especially, Moana Strauss for generously sharing her flat and car during my
months of fieldwork. The Gurungu Council in Elliott, who initiated this project, helped
enormously in obtaining funding for my visits and was always cooperative, as was the
Papulu Apparr-kari language centre in Tennant Creek.
   A very special thanks goes to. Nick Evans, who was a dedicated and enthusiastic MA
supervisor, and who first got me interested in working on Australian languages. Without his
invaluable advice, support and encouragement this project might never have got off the
ground. Robert Hoogenraad provided general encouragement and help in the field and I was
also fortunate enough to spend some time in the field with Luise Hercus, David Nash and
Gavan Breen, whose kind support and advice were most appreciated. Many thanks are due
also to John Henderson and Robert Hoogenraad, who provided much-needed computer
assistance. For insightful comments on various aspects of this grammar I am indebted to
Peter Austin, Juliette Blevins, Joan Bresnan, Margaret Carew, Ian Green, John Hajek and
Lesley Stirling. In particular, my revisions to this grammar have benefited enormously from
the comments and suggestions of my two MA examiners, Bill McGregor and Jane Simpson.
Of course, none of these people can be held responsible for any of the remaining flaws or
inadequacies.
   This project would not have been possible without the financial support of the Australian
Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies grant L91/4100, and the Australian
Research Council grant A58930745 (awarded to Nick Evans) entitled 'Non-Pama-Nyungan
languages of Northern Australia: descriptive, grammatical, comparative and sociolinguistic
investigations'. Funding for an additional field trip in 1994 was provided by the Centre for
the Study of Language and Information at Stanford University, with the help of Peter Sells
and Stanley Peters. I thank all these people and organisations for their generous support.
   My heartfelt thanks go to Dean Robinson, who stood by me throughout this project and
put up with my many moods and absences. My family and friends also provided much
valued support and encouragement. I thank them all for their patience and understanding.

Note on translations
Translations in this work are mostly my own. Those that are not are given in inverted
commas. Where English makes distinctions that Wambaya does not (such as definiteness in
NPs) I have made these distinctions in the English translations according to context.

    In Hale (1959), the gender suffi xes for Wambaya are given as: -0 — -(y)i `mase',. -ma 'fern', -ma
     'vegetable' and -(w)a `neuter'.
10 The one exception to this is the Class I non-absolutive suffix -ni- when it occurs with Class. I modifiers.
     In just this case the non-absolutive suffix is added to the absolutive form of the noun rather than
     replacing the absolutive suffix:
         gunv-i other-LABS > gunyi-ni- other-LNABS-

   As shown in Table 4.3, there are a number of different allomorphs for all genders except
Class In. As Classes I and II have the largest number of allomorphs, I will discuss them first,
and will then discuss the gender marking on Class Iv nouns.
   The most common Class II absolutive allomorphs and the common non-absolutive
allomorphs for both Classes I and II are all phonologically conditioned: the initial nasal of the
suffix assimilates to the place of articulation of the preceding consonant (i.e. the final
consonant of the root). Thus:11
       Class II absolutive: UR = -rna
        -ma > -nya \ j, ny
               > -nga \ g, ng
               > -ma elsewhere
       Class I non-absolutive: UR = -ni-
        -ni- > -nyi- \ j, ny
               > -ngi- \ g, ng
               > -ni- elsewhere
       Class II non-absolutive: UR = -nga-
        -nga- > -nya- \ j, ny
               > -nga- elsewhere
   This allomorphic variation is shown in the following examples in which the underlying
allomorphs are given between percentage signs.l 2

   This pattern of allomorphic alternation holds for most of the nominals and nominal
suffixes for which there is sufficient data in the corpus. However there are some nouns1 I Note that, interestingly, it is the Class t non-absolutive suffix -ni- which is used with foreign (i.e.
     English) words:
         Yaniyawulu narunguja-wulu             garage-ni-ni.
         that.IV.DU.NOM car.iV-DU(NOM) garage-I.NABs-Loc
         Those two cars are in the garage.
12 For a discussion of the morphophonemic processes by which the final consonant of the root is dropped
     or nasalised before the gender suffix see §2.3.
13 Nominal roots can often be indentified from the dual form of the nominal since the dual suffix is usually
     attached to the form minus the gender suffix: bungmaj-bulu, marndag-bulu, for example (see 4.3.2).
                                                                                 Nominals    67which have, for example, the Class II suffix -nya in their citation form, but for which it is
unknown whether the root ends in a palatal consonant (i.e. the root is not present in the
current corpus). An example of such a noun is gulangunya `blue-tongue lizard' (II). These
nouns do not contradict this analysis and so, for the present purposes, I assume them to be
consistent with it_ There are some Class H nouns that have the -nya absolutive suffix, but for
which it would seem (on the basis of the Class I counterpart) that the root does not have a
final palatal consonant, M of these examples are kinship nouns and, as there are other
examples of kinship nouns behaving differently with respect to gender marking (see below),
these are not considered to invalidate the rules of distribution of allomorphs outlined above.
Some examples of these nouns are:
      Class I                          Class II
      gugu-O   MMB                     gugunya         MM
      barnga-O male cross-cousin       barnganya       female cross-cousin
      ganggu-O FF                      ganggunya       FFZ   The Class I absolutive allomorphs are mostly phonologically conditioned also. Class I
nouns are inflected with jii after consonant-final roots and -( after vowel-final roots (see
bungmaji and abajabajî above). Class I modifiers and suffixes have -0 after roots ending in /i/
and usually have -i with other vowel-final roots, although there are a couple of adjectives that
are inflected with -yi. As with nouns, consonant-final adjectival roots are followed by the
gender suffix ji. Examples are:
     Root               Class I form   Gloss
     -barb         >     barlî-©       AGNT
     gurijbi-      >    gurijbi-O      good
     gunya-        >    gunyi          other
     munduru-      >    munduri        short, little
     gain-         >    gamayi         long
     buga-         >    bugs yi        big
     garnguj-      >    gamgu ji       many
     bagig-        >    bagi-ji        bad
   Synchronically the three suffixes that appear with vowel final roots — -0, -1, -yi are
clearly distinct- However, there is evidence suggesting that the original system had a simple
opposition between ji after consonants and -yi after vowels (note that lenition of /j/ to /y/
between vowels is common in Wambaya — see §2.3.1), meaning that all three of the above
suffix derive from the original allomorph -yi. This evidence includes the following:
  (i) Almost all of the nouns and all of the modifiers and suffixes which take the absolutive
      suffix -0 end in Ti!. This suggests that there has been a coalescence of the original
      gender suffix -yi with the root such that the final vowel of the root and the initial
      semivowel of the suffix were elided, resulting in the fV-final modern-day forms that
      now have no overt absolutive gender suffix. Examples include:
     burrulyi        tadpole
     dirdibulyi      peewee
     marunki         male countryman
     ngarrinybi      male friend
     galyurringî     water
     wardangarrî     moon

      -barli           AGNT
      gurijbî          good
   The same could also be true of the modifiers and suffixes with other final vowels that now
take the gender suffix Ii/: the final vowel of the root an d the semivowel of the suffix elided in
the Class I form, leaving /i/ as the gender suffix.
 (ii) There are a few places in which the original form -yi has been preserved. The two
      adjectives garna- and buga- contain the suffix -yî in their Class I forms (see above), and
      POK preserves it in the Class I noun mardumbarra `saltwater crocodile', pronouncing it
      mardumbarrayi. There are also a couple of nouns, such as wagalatnarri `crow', which
      are given in Hale (1959:17) as having a final suffix -yi: wagalamarriyi.
   There are a few Class I and Class II gender suffixes which are found only with kinship
nouns. These are the Class I non-absolutive suffixes -rdi and -na, the Class II absolutive
suffix -rda , and the Class II non-absolutive suffix -ga.
   The two Class I non-absolutive suffixes -na and -rdi14 are found with masculine kinship
nouns that take the -0 absolutive suffix. The former of these, along with the Class II non-
absolutive suffix -ga to be discussed below, conditions the irregular ergative/locative suffix
-yi (see §4.4.3). As far as I can tell, there is no phonological conditioning of these two
allomorphs. The kinship nouns with which they are found in the corpus include the
following:
      Absolutive form Non-absolutive form Gloss
      jugu-0          juguna-             MB

      ganggu-0        ganggurdi-          FF    Many Class II kinship nouns take the non-absolutive suffix -ga, which conditions the
irregular ergative/locative suffix -yi (see §4.4.3). Following is a list of the nouns taking this
suffix found in the present corpus.
      Absolutive form         Non-absolutive form Gloss

    suffix found on some Class II kinship nouns (see below), it is presumably related to the widespread
    kinship affix *-rti discussed by Nash (1992).
                                                                                Nominals   69  The regular Class n absolutive suffix for kinship nouns is -nya (see above). However, a
few nouns have alternative forms in which the absolutive suffix is -rda:
      gugunya gugurda MM
      ngayijinya ngayijirda     FM
      gambaranya gambararda MZ
      jamînjilînya jamînjilirda MFZ
   The remaining few Class I and II gender suffixes are found on only one or two forms. The
Class I non-absolutive suffix -dî is found only with the noun yangaji `meat'. The Class II
absolutive suffixes -rra and -0 are found with nouns such as gujinganjarra `mother' and
nayida `woman', respectively. Nouns taking these absolutive suffixes take the non-absolutive
suffix -nga.
    The discussion so far has concentrated on Class I and Class II gender suffixes. The Class
III gender suffixes are straightforward as they are consistent on all members of the class, but
there is some variation in the gender suffixes for Class IV. For the large part, Class IV
nominals are not overtly marked in either the absolutive or the non-absolutive:
      Absolutive form Non-absolutive form Gloss
      darranggu-O     darranggu-0-        tree
      lagija-O        lagija-0-           coolaman
      gujarra-O        gujarra-0-         two
      -baja-0          -baja-0            PRIV
   There are a small number of Class ry nominals, however, which appear to have an overt
gender suffix -a, as shown by the fact that it is replaced in the non-absolutive form with the
suffix -i:
     Absolutive form Non-absolutive form Gloss
     mag-a            mag-i-             camp
     iligirr-a        iligirr-i-         river
  However, there is no synchronic evidence for the existence of mag- or iligirr- as a root.
For example, the dual suffix attaches to the absolutive form of the noun:
     maga-wulu camp-DU
     iligirra-wulu ri ver-DU
    The absolutive suffix -a is also present in the Class N noun burnariga `wild orange tree',
as shown by comparison with the Class in counterpart burnaringma `wild orange (fruit)', and
it is the Class N suffix used with /i/-final modifiers/suffixes:
     Root      Class ry form Gloss
     -barb- -barl-a          AGNT
     gayinî gayin-a          who/what
     gurijbi- gurzjb-a       good
   The other Class N absolutive gender suffixes: -ga, -ja and -wa, are found only on
modifiers and nominal suffixes. The palatal-initial allomorph -ja occurs with palatal-final
roots and the velar-initial allomorph -ga appears with roots ending with any other consonant:
     -guny-       PL     -ganja        PL.IV.ABS
     garnguj-     many . garngc ja     many.N.ABS

      bagig-       bad      bagiga     bad.IV.ABS
   In the non-absolutive case these suffixes become ji- and -gi- respectively.
   The Class Iv absolutive suffix -wa is found with only two adjectives: garnaxa 15
long.IV.ABS' and buguwa `big.IV.ABS'. These two adjectives are unusual in many respects:
they both take an irregular Class I absolutive suffix -yi (discussed above), the Class II form of
each of them is formed by adding the Class II suffix to the Class I form rather than to the root,
and the Class III form of each of them is formed by adding the Class III suffix to the Class IV
form, rather than to the root.
      Root    Gloss Class I Class H   Class III Class IV
      garna- long garnayî garnayirna garnawama garna(w)a
      buga-16 big   bugayî bugayirna buguwama buguwa
   For the purposes of clarity and simplicity, I will not segment the roots and gender suffi xes
in the examples in this description. Furthermore, I will not include the glosses `ABS' and
`NABS', since this information is clear from the form of the case marking (i.e. the non-
absolutive gender suffix appears only before a non-zero case suffix). Thus, the nominative
and ergative/locative forms of the noun bungmajî will be glossed as follows:
      bungmaji     old.man.I(NOM)
      bungmanyî-ni old.man.I-LOC
4.2.3 ODD AGREEMENT
  The usual case is for a Class I noun to require Class I agreement on a modifier, a Class II
noun to require Class II agreement, and so on. However, there are times when the gender of a
modifier does not agree with the gender of the noun that it modifies. Examples of this `odd
agreement' can be classified into two different types: `natural semantic agreement' and
`unmarked gender agreement'.
(i) Natural semantic agreement
    This is the less common of the two types of odd agreement. As the name implies, in this
type of agreement the gender of the modifier agrees with the natural semantic `gender' of the
noun (Class Iv), rather than the grammatical gender to which the noun belongs (Class I or
Class II). This agreement, although often found in people's casual speech, is rejected by
speakers as ungrammatical when repeated back to them.
   Two examples of this type of agreement involve the nouns wawunji `honey, sugarbag' (I)
and bayigina `bag' (II). These are inanimate nouns which belong to animate noun classes. In
the following examples a Class iv modifier occurs with these nouns, thus agreeing with the
inanimate semantics of the noun, rather than the animate grammatical gender.
   (4-9) Aliyulu ng-a          bulyungu    wawunji.

"    Note that all tense/aspect/mood suffixes with initial /u/ trigger regressive vowel harmony in minimal
    subject bound pronouns. For a full discussion of vowel harmony in the auxiliary see §2.3.4.3.

                      Intransitive non-min. subj            -a                  -0
    The fact that auxiliaries with a third person object behave in the same way as intransitive
auxiliaries suggests that, rather than third person object being marked in the auxiliary with a
zero morpheme (as might be a more standard analysis), it is actually not marked in the
auxiliary at all (Nordlinger 1993b). This being the case, it is unproblematic to account for
why it is that auxiliaries with a third person object behave in the same way as intransitive
auxiliaries: they are the same in that they do not contain an object bound pronoun. Thus, the
tense-marking system in the auxiliary is based not on whether the clause is transitive or
intransitive, but on whether or not the auxiliary contains an object bound pronoun. Table 5.3
is the revised table of tense distinctions in the auxiliary.9
                 TABLE 5.3: TENSE DISTINCTIONS IN THE AUXILIARY (REVISED)10                                                           Past    J Present        Future
                     With Obj                                     -a                 -u
                     Without Obj min. subj                 -a           -0           -u
                     Without Obj non-min. subj             -a                 -0
   It is interesting that the same three inflections are used in slightly different ways to
differentiate the three tense marking systems. While -u, if it occurs, is always future tense,
-a can be either past or non-future, and -0 can be either present or non-past. If the three-way
system (see Table 5.3) is taken to be basic this can be described in the following way. If two
tense categories are to be collapsed (as happens with auxiliaries with objects, and auxiliaries
with non-minimal subjects and without objects) then the inflection that marks the most
anterior tense (i.e. that which would occur furthest to the left on a time scale going from past
tense to future tense) is generalised to mark the new tense category. For example, when the
auxiliary contains an object, the tense categories of `past' and `present' are collapsed into
`non-future'. The inflection for this new `collapsed' category is that which is used for the
most anterior of the two collapsed categories, that is `past', and is therefore -a. When the
categories of `present' and `future' are collapsed, as they are when an auxiliary contains a
9    Note that I am not claiming that transitive clauses with third person objects have no object. I am
     claiming only that there is no object represented in the auxiliary (i.e. as opposed to the marking being
     zero). Thus, the terms `With Obj' and `Without Obj' in Table 5.3 refer to the absence or presence of an
     object marker in the auxiliary and not to the presence or absence of an object in the clause.
     A possible altern ative analysis, suggested by Jane Simpson (pers.comm.), is to treat the system as
     completely tripart ite such that the present tense suffix has two allomorphs: -a after consonant-final clitics
     (i.e. after the two object bound pronouns), and -0 elsewhere. However, note that consonant final suffixes
     are possible in the auxiliary, in the directional suffixes 05.3), and the progressive suffix (§5.2.3).
     Furthermore, there are other suffixes that also have two-way, rather than three-way, tense distinctions
     such as the habitual suffixes (§5.2.2) and the directional suffixes (§5.3). Analysing all of these as having
     a tripartite system would lead to an enormous amount of homophony, thus I prefer the analysis pi esented
     here.
10 Table 6.5 shows the interaction between these and verbal tense categories.
                                                                                    The auxiliary   147non-minimal subject and no object, the inflection that would ordinarily mark present tense
(-0) is generalised to mark the new category, non-past tense. This explains why it is that the
future tense inflection is never used to mark anything except for future tense, as `future' can
never be the most anterior of two tense categories.","[163, 164, 165]"

1    Wambaya is alone among the McArthur dialects in inflecting the verb for tense: in neither Gudanji nor
     Binbinka is the verb inflected in main clauses (Chadwick 1978:84). In Ngarnga, the verb also shows a
     future/non-future contrast: however, interestingly, the basic verb form (i.e. that which corresponds to the
     non-future verb form in Wambaya) is used in the future tense, while verbs in past and present tenses are
     inflected with the suffix -ani (p.85).
2    The thematic      of 7 Class verbs also appears before derivational suffixes such as -barli- 'AGNT' and
     -baja- 'PRIV'. For example:
         dag    j-moi hit-TH-AGNT (I)
         daguma j-baji     hit-TH-PRIV (I)
3.   The non-future tense form of a verb is also the citation form, and thus is more like a general unmarked
     form (see below).

158    Chapter 6   Note that the three nominal suffixes -ni, -nka and -nnga are preceded here with /i/. This is
an epenthetic vowel which occurs between the final consonant of a verb stem (whether this
consonant is the final consonant of the root itself, or the thematic consonant /j/) and a
following suffix with an initial nasal. The epenthetic vowel breaks up what would otherwise
be an impossible consonant cluster. (A nasal can be the second element of a consonant cluster
only when it is preceded by a hetero-organic nasal; see §2.2.3). When the details of verbal
morphological structure are not significant I will not segment this epenthetic vowel in
examples in this work, but will group it with the preceding morpheme. For example:
      daguma ji-nka     hit-TH-DAT (NOT daguma j-î-nka )
      ngarli-nka        talk-DAT    (NOT ngarl-i-nka)
   Some examples of inflected verbs from each class are given in Table 6.2. Due to lack of
space, the inflection of only one of the nominal suffixes (-nka) is exemplified. Irregular verbs
are given in Table 6.4 below. In all of the following tables an underline indicates that the
corresponding form is not present in the corpus.

   *Note that the final consonant of this root is dropped before an inflection with initial /b/. I
have no explanation for this as /gb/ is a permissible consonant cluster in Wambaya (e.g.
gulugbi `sleep'). See §2.2.3 for a discussion of consonant clusters in Wambaya.
   As can be seen in Table 6.2, membership of the two conjugation classes is phonologically
determined: verbs with vowel-final roots belong to the J Class and those with consonant-final
roots belong to the 0 Class.
                                                                                   Verbs    159   An alternative analysis for the verbs of the J Class would be to consider the /j/ as in fact
belonging to the verb root, rather than being thematic. Under this analysis the non-future
suffix would still be -0, but the final consonant of the root would be dropped according to
the general phonotactic constraint that words in Wambaya be vowel-final (see §2.2).
However, if the roots of J Class verbs contain a final /j/, then there is no obvious explanation
as to why these verbs belong to a different class than other verbs, such as ngaj- `see', which
also have fj/-final roots. Under the `thematic /jr analysis however, this inconsistency is
avoided as the roots of these two verbs are different: one (daguma-) is vowel-final and the
other (ngaj-) is consonant-final.
  There is some evidence, however, to suggest that /j/ may once have been part of the verbal
root, or even part of the non-future inflection, -bi. For example, many of the verbs of the J
Class have cognates in other languages/dialects of the Eastern. Group that have final
jbi in the non-future fornt4

   One of the particularly interesting things about the Wambaya verbal inflections is their
striking similarity to some of the verbal inflections in Garrwa, a language which borders
Wambaya but appears otherwise unrelated to it. According to the analysis of Garrwa verbs
proposed by Belfrage (1992:46), Garrwa has five verbal conjugation classes. Of these five
there are two which show substantial similarity to the two Wambaya classes and are also
referred to by Belfrage as the J conjugation class and the 0 conjugation class. Table 6.3 gives
the forms of the inflections for these two Garrwa verbal conjugation classes.
    TABLE 6.3: GARRWA J AND 0 CONJUGATION CLASSES (FROM BELFRAGE 1992:46)                                            J              0

                        Sequential          -jiwa          -(bi)jîwa
                        Same subject        -jina          -(bi)jîna
                        Different subject   -(j)kurri      -(bî)kurri
                        Infinitive          -(j)kanyi      -(bi)kanyi
   Thus, Class J verbs in Garrwa have the same /jb/ sequence in their unmarked form that is
so distinctive to verbs in Wambaya. Furthermore, the unmarked inflections of these two
classes in Garrwa are identical to the future tense inflections that occur in the respective
Wambaya classes. And the Wambaya non-future inflection, -bi, turns up (optionally) before4   The Ngamga information is taken from Chadwick (1971). The Gudanji information is from my own
    field notes.
160    Chapter 6the other inflections of the 0 Class in Garrwa. Another point of comparsion is the Garrwa
`same subject' inflection which is very similar in form to the `same subject' inflection (i.e. the
ergative/locative case) in the J Class in Wambaya: j-ini. This inflection in Wambaya is used
to mark same subject in non-finite clauses that are simultaneous with the main clause (see
§8.1). In Wambaya this inflection is analysed as consisting of the thematic consonant r/,
followed by the epenthetic vowel /i/ and then the ergative/locative case inflection -ni. The
Garrwa inflection also appears to be based on the locative inflection, which is -na in Garrwa
(Belfrage 1992:13). Although it is not unusual for the locative case inflection to be used to
mark same subject in this region (see Austin 1981b), it is interesting here that the two
inflections both precede the locative suffix with the sequence /ji/. In Garrwa however, unlike
Wambaya, the full form -jina is also used with the 0 Class. In Wambaya the form that occurs
with the 0 Class is -ini. There is clearly need for more detailed comparative work between
these two languages.
   There are a number of irregular Wambaya verbs which do not belong to either of the two
conjugation classes discussed here. Table 6.4 gives the forms of such verbs that are present
in the corpus, along with the regular verbs daguma `hit' and ngajbi `see' for comparison
(non-italicised). A question mark indicates that the form given is hypothesised, but not
confirmed.

   The verb mirra is irregular in not taking the non-future tense inflection -bi, as other
consonant-final verb roots do. Wugbardi has an irregular alternative future tense form. Both
gajurru and nanganangali have irregular infinitive forms and gajurru, along with ganjimi, has
an irregular future tense form. The remaining five verbs are irregular in that they do not
distinguish future and non-future tense. Furthermore, verbs such as yarru and gannga have
alternative infinitive and/or DAT forms, one of which contains the corresponding regular J
Class inflection. Yugu takes the 0 Class infinitive inflection but the J Class DAT inflection.

6.1 INFLECTIONAL MORPHOLOGY
6.1.1 NON-FUTURE INFLECTION
   As discussed above, the non-future suffix is either -0 (with vowel-final stems) or -bi
(with consonant-final stems). The non-future form of the verb is also the citation form of the
verb and thus may in fact be better considered as the unmarked form. The non-future
inflection is used in both past and present tenses and can also be used in the immediate future
tense (examples (6-1) and (6-2)) in which case it is accompanied by future tense marking in
the auxiliary. This is one case in which there is a mismatch between the tense marking in the
auxiliary and that on the verb.5

  (6-2)     Yarru        ga              ginmanji ngaba murnd-u                     ngarl-wi!
            go(FUT) SG.IMP.TWD this.way THEN 1DU.INC.S-FUT talk-NF
            Come here so that we can talk!
  The non-future form of the verb can also be found in some imperative constructions:
  (6-3)     Alyu nyi-ng-a                  daguma-0!
            NEG.IMP 2SG:A-IO-NF            hit-NF
            Don't hit me!
  (6-4)     Bard-bi garna!
            run-NF SG:IMP.AWY
            Run over there!
  Imperative constructions are discussed in more detail in §6.1.2.
   Its appearance in some future and imperative constructions as well as the fact that it is
always the citation form of the verb suggests that the non-future form is really more like an
unmarked verb form. Therefore, I will treat it as unmarked in example sentences elsewhere in
this work:
     dagunta      hit    (not 'hit(NF)')
     ngajbi      see (not ngaj-bi `see-NF')
6.1.2 FUTURE INFLECTION
   The future tense suffix is -ba, or -wa after liquids. As well as being used in future tense
clauses (examples (6-5) and (6-6)), the future tense suffix also marks imperative mood ((6-7)
and (6-8)). While they contain the same verbal inflection, an imperative construction is
distinguished from a future tense construction since the auxiliary in an imperative
    See Table 6.5 for the possible combinations of verbal and auxiliary tense categories.
162     Chapter 6
construction usually carnes non-future tense marking (6-7) while in a future tense
construction it carries future tense marking (6-5). (See §5.5 for a discussion of the auxiliary
in imperative constructions and Table 6.5 for the interaction between auxiliary and verbal
tense categories). Recall that a future tense construction, such as in example (6-5), can have a
polite imperative reading (see §5.5 for more examples).
    (6-5)     Jiya-j-ba nyu-ng-u manganyma.
              give-TH-FUT 2SG.A-10-FUT tucker.III(ACC)
              You will give me some tucker./Give me some tucker (polite).
    (6-6)     Angbardi-j-ba îrri         ngîrra         barrawu.
              build-TH-FUT 3PL.A(NP) 1PL.EXC.OBL house.IV(ACC)
              They're going to build (new) houses for us.

              Give me some tucker!

              talk-FUT mother.II-DAT
              Talk to your mother!
   In two types of imperative constructions — negative imperative constructions and
constructions containing imperative directional suffixes — it is possible for the verb to appear
without future tense marking. Examples include (6-3) and (6-4) above, and the following:
    (6-9)     A lyu     junmi/junmi-j-ba!
              NEG.IMP cut(NF)/Cut-TH-FUT
              Don't cut it!
    (6-10) Alyu      nyi-ng-a   daguma/daguma j-ba!
           NEG.IMP 2SG.A-IO-NF hit(NF)/hit-TH-FUT
           Don't hit me!
    (6-11)    Wugbardi gama!      OR Wugbardi -j-ba gama!
              cook(NF) SG.IMP.AWY    cook-TH-FUT
              Go and cook it!
    (6-12)    Gaj-bi girrama!   OR Gaj-ba girrama!
              eat-NF PL.IMP.TWD    eat-FUT
              Come and eat!
   The absence of future tense marking in these constructions can probably be accounted for
by the fact that the negative particle and the directional suffixes are specifically imperative.
Thus, with their presence the clause is already marked as imperative, rendering it unnecessary
for this to be also indicated on the verb.
   Verbs such as yarru `go' and yabu `take, have', which do not distinguish future and non-
future tense (see Table 6.4 above), always co-occur with directional suffixes in the imperative
mood. As these directional suffixes are inherently imperative, it is thus possible to make a
distinction between imperative clauses and future tense clauses with these verbs.6
6     Note that, as these verbs make no distinction between future and non-future tenses, the glossing of them
      as `FUT' in these examples is, to a certain extent, arbitrary.
                                                                                             Verbs    163   (6-13)   Yarru gams        ginmanjî!
            go(FUT) SGJMP.TWD this.way
            Come over here!
   (6-14)   Yarns g-ulama           ginmanji.
            go(FUT) 3SG.S-NP.TWD this.way
            He will come over here.
   (6-15)   Yabu        ga            gujînganjanga-nmanji!
            take(FUT) SGJMPAWY mother.II-ALL
            Take her to (her) mother!
  (6-16)    Yabu        gunu-uba            gujinganjanga-nmanjî.
            take(FUT) 3SG.M.A-NP.AWY mother.11-ALL
            He will take her to (her) mother.
   The fact that these verbs often occur with directional suffixes, which themselves mark
imperative mood and tense (in indicative clauses), may explain why it is that they are not
overtly inflected for tense themselves; we have already seen examples in which the verbal
inflection is omitted when it co-occurs with directional suffixes (examples (6-11) and (6-12)
above). However, even in clauses without directional suffixes, these verbs are not overtly
inflected for future tense:
  (6-17)    Yarru       ng-u   marndijî.
            go(FUT) 1 SG.S-FUT later
            I'll go later.
  (6-18)    Yabu       ny-u         garnguji alaji.
            have(FUT) 2SG.A-FUT many.I(ACC) boy.I(ACC)
            You'll have lots of kids.
   The future tense inflection is used both in imperative constructions (as discussed above)
and in future tense constructions (examples (6-5) and (6-6)). In clauses with immediate future
tense however, and in negative future tense clauses, the verb occurs in the non-future form.
For examples of clauses with immediate future tense see (6-1) and (6-2). Some examples of
future tense negative clauses follow.
  (6-19)    Yangula irr-agba        jiyawu.
            NEG       3PLA-HYP give(NF)
            They will not give it to him.
  (6-20)    Yangula ng-agba        ngara-bi ngijininima.
            NEG         tSG.A-HYP drink-NF tomorrow
            I will not drink tomorrow.
   Table 6.5 shows the possible combinations of auxiliary and verbal tense categories.?
Recall that the tense categories of the auxiliary differ depending on the number of the subject
bound pronoun and the presence/absence of an object bound pronoun (§5.2.1). Thus, some
auxiliaries will collapse some of the distinctions made in this table. Note also that some of
these marking patte rns are optional; that is auxiliaries in imperative constructions can actually
have no tense marking at all (see §5.5).","[175, 176, 177, 178, 179, 180, 181]"
"     Note also that the first dual inclusive free pronouns pattern consistently with the other non-singular
     forms (see §4.8).
6    See §2.3.4.3 for a detailed discussion of vowel harmony in the auxiliary.
144      Chapter 5   As the system of number in Wambaya as a whole distinguishes singular, dual and plural
number, mîrndi is considered essentially a dual category. In the discussion of the instances in
which it patterns with the singular forms, I will use the term `minimal' to refer to the group
containing the singular bound pronouns and mirndi, and `non-minimal' to refer to the group
consisting of the other non-singular forms. For a discussion of `minimal' in pronominal
systems see Conklin (1962) and McKay (1975, 1978), among others.","[161, 162]"

7.2 VERBAL CLAUSES: BASIC ARGUMENT STRUCTURES
   In this section I discuss basic verbal clauses in terms of their main verb and the core
arguments that it subcategorises for: subject, (direct and second) object, indirect object and
subject complements. In §3.2 I outlined the criteria by which these different argument types
can be identified in Wambaya. Some aspects of this discussion, namely the distinctions
between the different types of objects,. are worth reviewing here.
  (i) Direct objects are distinguished from second objects and indirect objects as they are
      registered on the auxiliary with an object bound pronoun.
 (ii) Second objects are found with a very small set of ditransitive verbs which also take a
      direct object (see §7.2.1.5). Like direct objects, second objects are always marked with
      accusative case and are thereby distinguished from indirect objects. Unlike direct
      objects, second objects can never be registered in the auxiliary.
(iii) Indirect objects are not registered with an object bound pronoun in the auxiliary. Nor
      are they marked with accusative case. In fact, indirect objects are almost always marked
      with the dative case, the one exception being the allative indirect object of yardi 'put'.
      Like other core functions, indirect objects are semantically unrestricted: their
      interpretation depends on the verb with which they occur. Furthermore, unlike other
      complements and adjuncts, some indirect objects can feed reflexive and/or reciprocal    As has been pointed out to me by Bill McGregor and Lesley Stirling (pers comm.). it is not surprising
    that a verbless clause will have an objective meaning and a verbal clause a subjective meaning. In
    verbless clauses the speaker is imputing a quality upon the subject (i.e. 'objective') and in verbal clauses
    the speaker is describing a situation, event or state (such as that of 'feeling').

        constructions, in which case the indirect object argument is registered on the auxiliary
        with the reflexive/reciprocal pronoun (see §5.1.1 and below).
   Table 7.1 shows the possible basic argument structures for verbs in Wambaya. Discussion
and examples of the different types follow the table. The finite clause complements of verbs
such as dîdîma `tell O that SCOMP', ngajbi `see that SCOMP', tunga `hear, remember that
SCOMP' are discussed in §8.2.1.3. Adjuncts and semantically restricted complements were
covered in the discussion of case marking in §4.4.

25 The following discussion is based on the discussions of foot and metrical phonology contained in Durand
    (1990), Goldsmith (1990) and Nespor and Vogel (1986). It has also benefited from some helpful
    comments from John Hajek and Juliette Blevins. Although I have presented a cyclic, derivational account
    of stress placement, it would also be possible to reformulate this account within a constraint-based
     framework such as Optimality Theory (Prince and Smolensky 1993).
26 Poser (1989) gives an account of the stress patterns in Diyari and Warlpiri without reference to specific
     morphological structure. In his analysis, stress assignment occurs cyclically and begins by moving from
     left to right. However, in order to account for the behaviour of successive degenerate feet which join
     together to make one foot, Poser postulates a rule termed Merger which links degenerate feet into binary
     feet, this time moving from right to left. Poser's account would also work for Wambaya, but the one
     given here is preferred as it avoids the need to be multidirectional. Furthermore, as the constraint against
     stress referring to specific morphological structure does not hold universally — e.g. Mayali (Evans
     1995b), Gooniyandi (McGregor 1990) — I do not think that there is a problem with morphologically
     sensitive stress placement rules.
                                                                           Phonetics and phonology 35
  b. If there are no heavy syllables, scan again from left to right and assign left-headed
      binary feet to each morpheme, beginning with the first syllable. If the morpheme is
      monosyllabic, making a binary foot impossible, assign a strong degenerate foot. Note
      that at this point there may be syllables as yet unassigned to feet.
(ii)a. Again moving from left to right, group two successive degenerate feet into one left
       headed binary foot.
  b. Group a degenerate foot with a preceding unattached syllable forming a left-headed.
      binary foot.27
(iii) Non-branching feet that do not carry primary word stress (i.e. those that are not initial
      and/or do not contain a long vowel) are deleted.
(iv) Stray syllable adjunction: all unattached syllables are attached directly to the prosodic
     word.
   Rule (i)a accounts for the fact that a long vowel is stressed even when it is not in the initial
syllable. Some examples follow; see example A below for a sample derivation:
   la. Nga.'naa.rra Brunette Downs Station
    b. ga.'laa        bone
    c. ga.'rdaa.la    gidgee tree
   According to Rule (i)a foot formation will not begin with the first syllable of these words,
but with the first heavy syllable (i.e. the second syllable). The first syllable will at this stage
remain unassigned, as in example A below.
    Rule (i)b applies to morphemes that do not have heavy syllables (note that long vowels are
very rare in Wambaya, so this type of morpheme is the most common). According to Rule
(i)b, if (i)a cannot apply (because there are no heavy syllables), foot formation begins with
the initial syllable of the morpheme. As feet must be binary, the final syllable of a morpheme
having an odd number of syllables will remain unassigned. See examples B and C below for
sample derivations.
    Rules (ii)a and (ii)b account for the behaviour of monosyllabic suffixes which, by virtue
of the second part of Rule (i)b, all now belong to degenerate feet. It is important that (ii)a
precede (ii)b as monosyllabic suffixes are grouped only with a preceding unattached syllable
if there is not another monosyllabic suffix to their right with which they can group. The
specification in (ii)b that the resulting foot be left-headed, combined with the fact that all feet
are quantity sensitive in Wambaya, ensures that (ii)b will not apply to the second syllable of a
word such as ga.'laa, which forms a degenerate foot due to (i)a. Sample derivations
concerning Rules (ii)a and (ii)b are D and E below.
   Rule (iii) is necessary to account for the fact that if a monosyllabic suffix (which belongs
to a degenerate foot due to (i)b) is not part of a binary foot after the application of Rules (i)
and (ii), it is unattached from foot structure at this stage and is later attached by Rule (iv). An
example of the application of Rule (iii) is in example F below.
  Rule (iv) attaches all remaining unattached syllables directly to the prosodic word.
Examples of the application of this rule are in examples A, B, D, and F below. The feet that27 Note that, since all feet are quantity sensitive, if the degenerate foot contains a long vowel and is the
    second syllable of a monomorphemic word (e.g. garnaa), (ii)b will not apply.

according to the following rule:
 (v) Group feet into a left-branching word tree.

rules. Syllables attached directly to the word level by Rule (iv) are shown with a broken line.

vowels. In §2.1.4 a distinction was made between these long vowels and phonetic long
vowels which are derived through regular language-internal processes of elision. An example
of a phonetic long vowel is that which is derived from the elision of the semivowel /w/ when
the dual suffix is added to the nominal darranggu:
       darranggu + wulu tree + DU > /darranggu + ulu/ ['drri t,gu ,u1u]
   Note that the assignment of stress must precede the morphophonemic process of elision as
these phonetic long vowels do not have primary stress (as a phonemic long vowel would),
and are treated as a sequence of two vowels, with the second carrying stress as it is the initial
syllable of a polysyllabic morpheme.
38     Chapter 2   The rules of stress placement in Wambaya are still not yet fully understood and further
research may lead to a different analysis of stress placement than presented here. While the
rules for foot and word construction given here account for the large majority of the corpus,
there are some unpredictable forms that these rules do not account for. A couple of these
exceptions follow (along with the expected pattern according to the above rules):
       'wug.ba.,rdij.+ba.,rli. + ma (expected:'wug.ba.rdij.+,ba.rli.+rna) cook+AGNT+ll
       'na.nga.na.,nga.li           (expected:'na. nga.,na.nga.li)       sneak away

4.4.8 COMITATIVE CASE
   The comitative case expresses accompaniment and has two allomorphs: -yili, which is
used only with free pronouns and is discussed in §4.8, and -mbili, which is used with all
other types of nominal. The comitative case is used only with animate nouns (the proprietive
suffix (§4.4.11) expresses this meaning with inanimate nouns). Some examples are:
   (4-141) Mirra ngi-n                   gujîga-mbîli         irdîna-mbîli.

           sleep     3SG.S-PST white.man.I-COMIT
           She slept with a white man.
   Note that the locative case can also be used with this function (see §4.4.3 above). I have
not yet been able to determine whether there is a contrast in meaning between this use of the
locative case and the use of the comitative case.

4.4.9 CAUSAL SUFFIX
   This suffix, -nmarndi, is used to mark a noun as the cause or reason for the event, and is
best translated into English with `because of . There are only two examples of this suffix in
the corpus:
   (4-144) Alangi-nmarndî ngiyi-ng-agba              ngurra         dawu.

7.4.2 SECONDARY PREDICATES
   An ascriptive NP can function as a secondary predicate (Nichols 1978) for the subject or
object of a finite clause, in which case, like all nominal modifiers, it must agree in case and
gender (and presumably number, although there are no relevant examples) with the nominal it
modifies. This secondary predicate provides information about the manner or state of the
argument during the time of the main predicate. Theoretically, since these secondary
predicates are adjuncts, any nominal could se rve as a secondary predicate co-occurring with
any verb. Examples of secondary predication follow.

          He looks after me, the sick one.
   In the following example, the secondary predicate (bugayirna ngabulungunya) is in the
nominative case, even though the clause is transitive and the subject is registered with a
transitive subject bound pronoun (and must, therefore, have ergative/locative case). This is
presumably because ergative NPs do not take ergative/locative case marking when fronted
(see §4.4.3).
  (7-133) Bugayirna ngabulu-ngunya, yagu ng-a                   ngarri
          big.Il(NOM) breast-PROP.II(NOM) leave 1 SG.A-PST I SG.POSS.I(ACC)
          irda.
          father.I(ACC)
          (When I was) grown up, having breasts, I left my father.
    True secondary predicates, such as those above, are characterised by the fact that the
clause can be seen as the conjunction of two separate predications: one without the secondary
predicate, and the other a nominal clause with the secondary predicate as the nominal
predicate. For example, (7-126) consists of the two propositions Gulugbi ga `She slept' and
Ilijbirna (nagarna) `(She) was alone'. Such constructions can thus be distinguished from the
syntactically similar use of (usually body-part) NPS in constructions of inalienable
possession. Consider the following examples:
  (7-134) Bagijbi ngi-n               juruma.
          feel.bad I SG.S(PR)-PROG stomach.iV(NOM)

propositions would give Bagijbi ngin 'I feel sick' and the non-sensical (Ngawurniji) juruma
`I am a stomach'. A further difference between the two constructions in Wambaya is that,
while the modifying NP in secondary predicate constructions must agree with the head noun
in gender and number as well as case, this is not true for examples such as (7-134) and (7-
135) above. For example, the subject in (7-134) (taken from Text 4 in Appendix A) has
masculine gender, while the nominal juruma `stomach' has vegetable gender. Therefore,
following Evans (1995a), I distinguish between true secondary predicate constructions and
subject/object-construed body-part constructions such as those in (7-134) and (7-135)
respectively.
   A small number of verbs subcategorise for secondary predicates on the subject, in which
case the modifying NP is referred to as a subject complement. Verbs requiring subject
complements were discussed in §7.2. For convenience, one example of the reflexive verb
manku `to feel', which subcategorises for a subject complement expressing the emotion
attributed to the subject, is repeated here.

    For the moment I will postpone discussion of the reflexive/reciprocal pronoun, which behaves a little
    differently from the other object bound pronouns. The reflexive/reciprocal pronoun is discussed in §5.1.1.
    Unfortunately, there are no examples in the corpus in which both objects are animate (e.g. They gave
    him that woman as a wife), so it is not possible to tell whether it is grammatical/semantic role or
    animacy which determines which argument will be registered in the auxiliary. I suspect, however, that it
    is the recipient that is consistently marked, providing evidence that it is the direct object of these verbs.

   The absence of a verbal root makes the structure of the auxiliary a little difficult to
characterise: are the bound pronouns prefixed to the tense markers, or are the tense markers
suffixed to the bound pronouns? Historically, it appears that the bound pronouns were
prefixed to an auxiliary verb which has since been reduced, or lost completely, and is now
represented only by the tense/aspect/mood and directional markers. However, strictly
speaking, it is no longer valid to say that the bound pronouns are prefixes in Wambaya, as
there is no verbal root to which they are prefixed.3
    In this work, I will call the pronominal elements `bound pronouns' and will refer to the
tense/aspect/mood and directional markers as `suffixes', while acknowledging this term's
slight inaccuracy.
   In this chapter I begin with a discussion of the bound pronouns in the auxiliary (§5.1),
then discuss the tense, aspect and mood marking (§5.2) and the directional suffixes (§5.3).
At the end of this chapter I deal with syntactic and functional aspects of the auxiliary: its
position in, or absence from, the clause (§5.4) and its behaviour in imperative constructions
(§5.5).","[155, 156]"
"   Given the similarities between the West Barkly gender suffixes and the Nungali prefixes it
is quite clear that they have derived from a single system. The interesting question, therefore,
is how they became suffixes in the West Barkly languages and prefixes in Nungali. There are
three different possibilities. Firstly, Chadwick (1978:336ff) proposes that the gender suffixes
of the modem West Barkly languages developed from ""postposed markers not previously
264     Appendix B
attached to the noun stem and simpler in form than the present suffixes"" (p.336). However,
this analysis does not account for why the demonstratives should have gender prefixes and
not suffixes. A second possible analysis is that the gender suffixes, or at least the postposed
gender markers, developed from the reduction of postposed demonstratives. The strongest
argument for this analysis is that it accounts for the absence of gender suffixes on
demonstratives themselves:8 we would not expect demonstratives to be postposed to
demonstratives. A third proposal, suggested by Ian Green (1995:421) combines both of these
two ideas. Green suggests that in Proto Mirndi the precursors of the present-day case
markers were in fact postposed to the nominals as separate words, as Chadwick suggests.
However, he also argues that Proto Mirndi at the same time had gender-prefixed
demonstratives which alternated with these postposed gender markers (these gender markers
belonging to the overall demonstrative paradigm), thus explaining why the demonstratives
did not acquire gender suffixes also. In the West Barkly languages, then, these postposed
markers became fused with the noun stems as suffixes, and in Nungali these developed into
prefixes on following modifers, later being also extended to head nouns. It may not be
possible to find evidence that would distinguish my proposal from Green's, although further
research is clearly required.
   In support of either of the latter two proposals is the strong similarity between the form of
the demonstrative gender prefixes and form of the pre-modern gender markers that Chadwick
reconstructs for the Eastern Group:
    Eastern Group pre-modern gender markers (from Chadwick 1978:336)
                I      II      III    IV
       ABS   Ji     ma ma a, u
       NABS  Ni nga
       (Where Ji denotes either ji or yi and Ni either nî or mi.)
   Except for Class IV, the forms of these markers are exactly the same as the Wambaya
prefixes found on demonstratives, and are also the same as the underlying gender suffixes
found with other nominals. The existence of Class Iv suffixes in Wambaya such as -ga and
-ja, as well as the demonstrative prefix ya-, suggests that the original Class IV marker may
have had an initial consonant, probably /g/. This is supported by the residual gu- prefix in
some Class iv forms (see above), the Binbinka Class Iv demonstrative prefix ga- and the
Class Iv demonstrative base in Jingili: -gu. Chadwick remains undecided as to whether the
pre-modern Class I absolutive marker should be reconstructed as jî or as yî. The fact that the
prefix ji- is found on some Class I demonstratives in Binbinka, and that it appears to be the
underlying Class I absolutive gender suffix on Wambaya nominals (see §4.2.2), suggests
that it may be better reconstructed as ji, with modern day (y)i forms (such as on Wambaya
demonstratives) having derived from ji by lenition of the initial consonant.","[281, 282]"

55 There are no Class t❑ forms in the corpus and no other case forms apart from ergative/locative,
     nominative and accusative. As the latter two case forms are homophonous I have listed them together.
56 I was unable to obtain ergative/locative singular forms; a regular ergative/locative demonstrative was
     always used instead.

   Example (4-247), however, further complicates the situation. In this example there are
three elements to the NP: a demonstrative, nagawulu and a head noun. As there are no other
examples in which two demonstratives appear together in the same NP, this suggests that
nagawulu can't be a demonstrative, at least in this example.

   Such examples suggest that igima is a remote demonstrative since, as mentioned above,
remote demonstratives are used to refer to something mentioned in earlier discourse that is
either a substantial distance away, or precedes the intervention of another topic.
   Perhaps these are generic nouns, meaning something along the lines of `male being',
`female being' and 'thing' that can either modify a noun (perhaps for the purposes of
emphasis or clarification), or can stand alone in the NP, in which case they are interpreted as
third person markers (e.g. remote demonstratives). This would explain the fact that they can
modify a head noun in. the NP, and themselves be modified by adjectives as the head of an NP
and co-occur with both a noun and a demonstrative within the one NP. It does not explain,
however, the fact that their form (i.e. the existence of a gender prefix and the demonstrative
form of the plural suffix) is more like a demonstrative than a noun. These forms only really
differ from true demonstratives in their stem -gi-/-ga-:

7.2.3.2 REFLEXIVE VERBS WITH SUBJECT COMPLEMENTS
   There are two reflexive verbs which subcategorise for subject complements: manku `feel
SubjCOMP' and yardî `turn into SubjCOMP'. With manku the subject complement expresses
the mental or physical state attributed to the subject; with yardi it refers to the entity that the
subject `turned into'. Examples include:
   (7-66)   Manku ngi-ngg-a       gurijbirna.
            hear     I SG.A-RR-NF good.II(NOM)
            I feel good.
   (7-67)   Yardi gini-ngg-a        barnanggi.
            put.   3SG.M.A-RR-NF bird.sp.I(NOM)
            He turned himself into a barnanggi
   Each of these verbs has an alternative case frame which is non-reflexive: nwnku is also a
simple transitive verb meaning `hear, think about'; and yardî is also a ditransitive verb
meaning `put'. However, the reflexive use discussed here is considered to be basic rather
than derived (at least, synchronically) as the meanings are sufficiently different from the non-
reflexive forms to consider them to be different lexemes synchronically. A derived reflexive
form of transitive manku, for example, would mean `hear oneself, think about oneself' and
would not subcategorise for the type of subject complement present in example (7-66) above.
186    Chapter 77.2.4 SEMITRANSITIVE VERBS
   Semitransitive verbs require an nominative subject and a dative indirect object. The indirect
object is not cross-referenced in the auxiliary. The semitransitive verbs in the corpus include
those describing (i) actions of searching or anticipation, such as ayani `look for IO', yandu
`wait for IO' and maranbi `feel around for I0'; (ii) verbal or non-verbal communication
towards or about entities, such as ardbi `call out to I0', ngarlwi `talk to IO, talk about I0',
garni `smile at 10'; and others such as kiji 'be gone for a long time from I0', durra `be
frightened of IO' and bundurrijbi `be/get full of IO, be/get pregnant with IO'.

            be.absent 3DU.S(NP)-PROG ISG.OBL that.one.I.DU.NOM
            They've been gone from me for a long time.
   Some of these semitransitive verbs can also occur as intransitive verbs, without the
indirect object. Examples were given in §7.2.2.1 above, of which two are repeated here.
   (7-71)   Garni gî-n            (ngarra).
            smile 3SG.S(PR)-PROG (1SG.OBL)

            be.frightened 1 SG.S(PR) (dog.I-DAT)
            I'm frightened (of the dog).
   Although these indirect objects are not cross-referenced with an object bound pronoun in
the auxiliary (example (7-73)), they can feed reflexive/reciprocal constructions, in which case
they are represented with the reflexive/reciprocal bound pronoun (7-74). This is one way in
which they can be distinguished from dative marked adjuncts (7-75) (see §3.2 for further
discussion).
   (7-73)   Ayanî ngîl*ngi-ny-a            nganga.
            look.for ISG.S(PR)/1SG.A-20-NF 2SG.OBL

            We're cooking for each other. (The only possible meaning is `We're cooking
            each other'.)
  The interaction of indirect objects and adjuncts with reflexive/reciprocal constructions has
not yet been fully explored: it may be that only some indirect objects can feed such
contructions and/or that some adjuncts can do so as well. Further investigation is required.
                                                                   Syntax of simple sentences   1877.2.5 TRANSITIVE VERBS
   Transitive verbs are characterised by the fact that they subcategorise for an ergative subject
argument and only one other obligatory object argument (in this respect they differ from
ditransitive verbs which require two object-type arguments).","[203, 204, 205]"

 34 The problem is not with the verbless sentence as MG accepts them as grammatical when the NP contains
     only one proprietive nominal. For example:
          Alaji        darranggu-nguji.
          boy.l(NOM) stick-PROP.l(NOM)
          The boy has a stick.
      It is possible that this difference may reflect a dialectal difference between Gudanji and Wambaya: MG,
      who rejects e.:amples in which the proprietive has phrasal scope, is a Wambaya speaker. MH, on the
      other hand, who accepts such examples, speaks a dialect that is predominantly Gudanji (with some
      W""ambaya mixed in). Th is will have to be explored further in the field.
 35 The morphophonemic processes that generate these forms are discussed in §2.3.

           *These forms are in free variation with -waji, -wajarna and so on in this environment.
   The non-absolutive forms of the Class I and II suffixes are -bajini-/-wajîni- (etc.) and
-bajanga-/-wajanga- (etc.), respectively. The Class Iv non-absolutive forms are the same as
the Class IV absolutive forms given above. For a more detailed discussion of gender marking
see §4.2.2.
   The root of the privative suffix, used as the stem for the addition of number suffixes, is
-baja-/-waja- (etc.). The privative suffix takes the -marnda- plural suffix (see §4.3.3.1).
   As with the proprietive suffix, there is some inconsistency in the data as to the form of the
stem to which the privative suffix is attached. For most nouns (particularly those belonging to
either Class III or Class IV) the privative suffix is attached to the citation form of the nominal,
including the gender suffix (if present). Some examples are:
   (4-179) yurula-ajama
           name.IV-PRIV.II(NOM)
           without a name (II)
   (4-180) gijîlulu-wajî
            money.IV-PRIV.I(NOM)
            without any money (I)
   (4-181) darima-aja
            plum.Ill-PRIV.IV (NOM)
            without any plums (IV)
   With other nouns, the privative suffix is attached to the root (minus the gender suffix):
   (4-182) gurij-baja                     (citation form of noun: gurija (IV))
            fat-PRIV.IV(NOM)
            without fat (IV)
   (4-183) alag-bajarna                   (citation form of noun: alaji (I) or alanga (II))
           child-PRIV.II(NOM)
           without children (H)
   (4-184) jany-bajî                      (citation form of noun: janji (1) or janya (II))
            dog-PRIV.I(NOM)
            without a dog (I)
   However, it seems that some nouns may be able to form the privative in either way. Thus
the (Class I) privative form of ilîga `sore' (IV) was given in the following two ways:
   (4-185) ilig-baji        AND îliga-aji
           sore-PRIV.I(NOM)     sore.IV-PRIV.I(NOM)

(I) is:
  (4-186) janji-yaji
          dogi-PRIV.I(NOM)
  Compare this with (4-184) given above.
   There are a number of similarities between the proprietive suffix and the privative suffix
with regard to the form of a particular noun that they take as their stem. Firstly, in both cases
the suffix usually attaches to the full citation form of Class IV and Class III nouns. Secondly,
both suffixes always attach to the root of the nominal alaji/alanga `child' (I/II) and can attach to
either the root or the citation form of the nominal iliga `sore' (IV). Although noteworthy, these
observations do not greatly help in arriving at an explanation for the difference in the form of
the stem with different nominals, but do suggest that the base form for adnominal inflection is
Iexically determined and that some forms (such as îliga `sore' (Iv)) are undergoing reanalysis.
In glossing, I will follow the same principle as for the proprietive suffix: where there is an
overt gender suffix on the base nominal, I will represent it in the interlinear gloss; where there
is no overt gender suffix I will not. Thus manganyma-aji `tucker.III-PRIV.I' but gunju-waji
`meat-PRIV.I'.
b) Function
   The privative suffix has two functions: the first with nominals (i), and the second with
verbs (ii).
(i) The privative suffix is used to negate the presence or existence of an entity.
   (4-187) Ngîrriy-ani        gijîlulu-waja-marndarna.
             IPL.EXC.NOM money-PRN-PL.II(NOM)
             We (women) have no money.
   (4-188) Ngarrirna             babanya         juwa-ajarna.
             t SG.POSS.II(NOM) sister.II(NOM) man-PRIV.II(NOM)
             My sister doesn't have a man/My sister is single.
   (4-189) Yarru g-a         manganyma-aji.
           go    3SG.S-PST tucker.III-PRIV.I(NOM)
           He went off without any tucker.
   A privative form can also be used to identify a person or a place:
   (4-190) Yandu ngi-n               murlu-wajanga-nka.
           wait 1SG.S(PR)-PROG eye-PRN.II-DAT
           I'm waiting for the blind woman.
   (4-191) Mirra irr-a            nguwi yaja-ni.
             sit     3PL.S-PST water-PRIV.IV-LOC
             They lived in the desert.
   As with the proprietive suffix, speakers disagree as to whether or not it is grammatically
correct for the privative suffix to occur on all words in a NP. Thus, while some speakers (e.g.
MH) consider example (4-192) to be a fully grammatical sentence, for at least one other
speaker (MG) it is impossible, a verbal clause such as (4-193) being necessary instead.
100 Chapter 4   (4-192) Alaji       buguwa-aji            darrangg u-waji.
           boy.I(NOM) big.IV-PRIV.I(NOM) stick-PRIV.I(NOM)
           The boy doesn't have a big stick.
   (4-193) Yangula gini             yabu buguwa     darranggu.
           NEG       3SG.M.A(PR) have big.IV(ACC) stick.IV(ACC)
           He doesn't have a big stick.
   However, MG does accept verbless sentences in which there is only one nominal in the
privative NP:
   (4-194) Alaji       darranggu-waji.
           boy.I(NOM) stick-PRIV.I(NOM)
           The boy doesn't have a big stick.
(ii) The privative suffix has another function in which it is used with any verb X to derive a
nominal meaning `one who cannot/does not do X'. The suffix is attached to either the root of
the verb or follows the thematic consonant (depending on the conjugation class of the verb:
see §6.1). Some examples of the use of the privative suffix in this function are:
   (4-195) Ngawurniji langan-bajarna.
           1 SG.NOM       climb-PRIV.II(NOM)
           I can't climb (that tree) (II).
   (4-196) Iniyaga         dawi j-bajî.
           that.I.SG.NOM bite-TH-PRP✓.I(NOM)
           That (dog) won't bite (I).
   (4-197) Aliyulu ng-u            gurijbi      ngaya,        daguma j-baji.
           find      1 SG.A-FUT good.I(ACC) 3SG.F.OBL hit-TH-PRIV.I(ACC)
           I'm going to find her a good (man), who doesn't hit.
   (4-198) Nananga ngiyi              ngarl-wajarna.
           care.for   3SG.NM.A(PR) talk-PRIV.II(ACC)
           She looks after the mute woman.
   (4-199) Manku-j-baja             maga.
            hear-TH-PRIV.IV(NOM) camp.IV(NOM)
            (It is a) noisy camp.","[115, 116, 117, 118]"
"
7.2.2.4 NGARLWI `TALK (LANGUAGE) (TO IO)'
   Ngarlwi is unique in that it subcategorises for a nominative subject NP and two optional
object arguments: an accusative object referring to the language spoken (usually called a
cognate object, e.g. Austin 1982) and a dative indirect object. It can, therefore, appear in four
different case frames, the most of any verb in the corpus: simple intransitive (example (7-
184     Chapter 758)), intransitive with cognate object (7-59), semitransitive (7-60), and semitransitive with
cognate object (7-61).11
     (7-58)   Ngarlwî ngurru-n.
              talk      1PL.INC.S(NP)-PROG
              We're talking.
     (7-59)   Ngarlwî gi            ngarlana.
              talk       3SG.S(PR) language.IV(ACC)
              He talks (the Wambaya) language.
     (7-60)   Ngarlwi ngi-n             nganga.
              talk       ISG.S(PR)-PROG 2SG.OBL
              I'm talking to you.
     (7-61)   Ngarlwi wurl-aji         jingulu irra,      gujinya       irda.
              talk     3DU.S-HAB.PST            3PL.OBL mother.II(NOM) father.I(NOM)
              My mother and father always spoke Jingulu to them.
   While there are other other verbs that occur with cognate objects (see §7.2.5.2), ngarlwi is
unique in that in clauses with the cognate object, the subject remains nominative and is
registered by an `intransitive subject' bound pronoun in the auxiliary. Other verbs taking
cognate objects, such as nijbi `sing (a song)' take ergative subjects which are registered by
`transitive subject' bound pronouns, when they occur in that case frame.","[201, 202]"

4.4.11 PROPRIETIVE SUFFIX
    The proprietive suffix is used to indicate that one noun `has' another. Its use in Wambaya
is rather restricted and, although it is occasionally used to indicate alienable possession (as in
`I have a spear'), it is most frequently used to indicate the physical characteristics of a person
(e.g. `She is pregnant'), an object (e.g. `tea with milk') or a place (e.g. `place with trees').
a) Form
   The proprietive suffix agrees in gender with the noun that it modifies:
   (4-155) alajî          darranggu-nguji
            boy.I(NOM) stick-PROP.I(NOM)
            a boy with (a) stick
   (4-156) alanga         darranggu-ngunya
           girl.II(NOM) stick-PROP.II(NOM)
           a girl with (a) stick
   (4-157) maga              darranggu-nguja
            camp.IV(NOM) tree-PROP.IV(NOM)
            a camp with trees
   The absolutive and non-absolutive forms for each gender are given in Table 4.10. The
gender marking with the proprietive suffix is regular for nominals (see §4.2.2) and the
different gender forms are all derivable from the root -nguj-. A noun with the proprietive
suffix must also agree with the case (example (4-158)) and number (4-159) of the noun or
referent that it modifies.
                                                                                       Nominals     95               TABLE 4.10: THE GENDER FORMS OF THE PROPRIETIVE SUFFIX                                    Absolutive form       Non-Absolutive form
                     Class I           -nguji                -ngunyi-
                     Class II          -ngunya               -ngunya-
                     Class III         -ngunyma              -ngunymi- (?)
                     Class IV          -nguja                 nguji-
   Number suffixes are added to the root, -nguj-. The proprietive suffix takes the -baia plural
suffix (see §4.3.3.1).
   Some examples of the proprietive suffix co-occuring with other suffixes are:
  (4-158) Wurrudbanyi ngiy-a                    maganja                   murlu-ngunya-ni.
            pull              3SG.NM.A-PST digging.stick.1V(ACC) eye-PROP.II-LOC
            The one that could see got the yam stick.
   (4-159) Nanawulu              nayîda-wulu         gijîlulu-nguj-bulu.
            this.H.DUNOM woman-DU(NOM) money-PROP-DU(NOM)
            These two women have money.
   (4-160) Ngirriyani            manganyma-nguj-balarna.
            I PL.EXC.NOM tucker.HI-PROP-PL.II(NOM)
            We've got tucker.
  There is some inconsistency in the corpus as to the form of the noun to which the
proprietive suffix is affixed. The usual case is simply to add it to the full citation form of the
noun (including the gender suffix). Thus:
   (4-161) manganyma-nguja
            tucker. II-PROP.IV (NOM)
           tucker-having (Iv)
   (4-162) janjî-ngunya33
            dog.I-PROP.II(NOM)
            dog-having (II)
   However, in other examples it seems that the proprietive suffix is added to a nominal root.
In these examples the root ends in /g/ and the initial consonant of the suffix is omitted:
   (4-163) alag-unya                   (citation form of noun: alaji (I) or alanga (II))

             sand-having (IV)
  For some nouns either alternative is possible. For example, the proprietive form of
marnarrga `mud' (IV) (here with Class II agreement) was given in two different ways:33 It would be interesting to see whether this form would contrast with a form janya-ngunya `dog.tt-
    PROP.n(NOt )' , in which the dog is marked as female and not male. This is something that needs to be
    checked in the field.

   Similarly, there are two different ways in which the nouns iliga `sore' (Iv) and wawunjî
`sugarbag' (I) can be inflected with the proprietive suffix:
     (4-166) iliga-nguji                AND      ilig-uji
             sore.I V-PROP.I(NOM)                sore-PROP.I(NOM)

             sugar bag-having (IV)
   If a noun retains an overt gender suffix (example (4-161)) I will represent it in the
interlinear glosses. If there is no overt gender suffix, however, I will not represent the gender
of the `base' noun in the gloss. For example, janji-ngunya will be glossed `dog.I-PROP.II' but
darranggu-ngunya will just be glossed `stick-PROP.II'.
b) Function
   The most common use of the proprietive suffix is to express a physical characteristic or
state of a person (examples (4-168) and (4-169)), an object (4-170) and (4-71) or a place (4
172).
     (4-168) Ilarra-wulu:      gunyama        murlu-ngunya     gunyarna

             fall     3SG.S-PST blood-PROP.II(NOM)

     (4-170) Yana               gunju      gurija-nguja.

             stone-PROP.IV(NOM) country.IV(NOM)
             (It's) stony country.
     Another use of the proprietive suffix is to express alienable possession:
     (4-173) Yandu ngi-n               bungmanya-nka   gijilulu-ngunya-nka.
             wait     ISG.S(PR)-PROG old.woman.II-DAT money-PROP.II-DAT

             see      ISG.A-PST big.IV(ACC) car.IV(ACC) sand-PROP.IV(ACC)
             I saw a big truck with sand (in it).
                                                                                          Nominals     97  The proprietive suffix can also be used to express accompaniment:
  (4-175) Bungmaji         iniyaga        g-uba     yarru balamurru-nguji.
          old.mani(NOM) that.I.SG.NOM 3SG.S-NP.AWY go(FUT) spear-PROP.I(NOM)
          That old man will go with a spear.
   Interestingly, some speakers restrict the proprietive suffix to having word scope, and
others use it with phrasal scope, marking the proprietive on all words of the NP. Thus, some
speakers (e.g. MH) considered the following examples to be perfectly grammatical (although
there are no such spontaneous examples in the corpus):
  (4-176) Alaji        buguwa-nguji      darranggu-nguji.
          boy.l(NOM) big.IV-PROP.I(NOM) stick-PROP.I(NOM)`
          The boy has a big stick.
   (4-177) Yarru ng-a         bayigi-ngunya ngarrirna-ngunya.
           go      1SG.S-PST bag-PROP.II(NOM) 1SG.POSS.II-PROP.II(NOM)
           I went (taking) my bag.
   However, one speaker in particular (MG) felt that they were completely ungrammatical and
that it was necessary to use a verbal clause instead, such as the following:34
   (4-178) Yabu gini-n                  buguwa        darranggu.
             have   3SG.M.A(PR)-PROG    big.IV(ACC)   stick.IV(ACC)
             He has a big stick.
   Note that Dench and Evans (1988) give phrasal scope as an essential characteristic of case
suffixes, as opposed to derivational suffixes. As the proprietive suffix can have phrasal scope
for some speakers it considered for present purposes to meet this criterion for casehood.
However, further investigation is required.","[112, 113, 114, 115]"
"3.1.1.2 VERBS
   Most of the information that is traditionally associated with verbs, such as tense, aspect
and mood, is found in the auxiliary in Wambaya. Verbs themselves have comparatively few
inflectional possibilities. In main clauses verbs make a `future'/`non-future' (or unmarked)
distinction with the future form also used in imperative constructions. The inflectional
possibilities for verbs are discussed in §6.1. In non-finite subordinate clauses verbs are
inflected with either the infinitive suffix -barda; or one of three nominal suffixes — the
ergative/locative -nî, the ablative -nnga or the dative -nka — which indicate, respectively,
whether the action described in the subordinate clause occurs concurrently, occurred
previously, or will follow that of the main clause. The use of these suffixes with verbs is
discussed in detail in §6.1 and §8.1. There is also a reduplication process which provides
some aspectual information (see §6.1.7). There are many derivational possibilities for verbs.
Verbs can be made into transitive verbs; causative verbs; and various types of nouns, both
                                                        Parts of speech and other preliminaries   51agentive and instrumental. The verb-to-verb derivational processes are discussed in §6.2.1,
and the verb-to-nominal processes in §4.5.2.
    Verbs in main clauses must always be accompanied by an auxiliary, which registers the
main arguments of the clause and often provides the only tense and aspect information. This
is in contrast with nominal predicates, which obligatorily occur without the auxiliary. There is
a tendency for verbs to occur in initial position in the clause: a survey of texts showed that
61% of verbal clauses were verb-initial.
   There is a group of verbs which, although clearly verbs in their own right, have another
function as adverbs, modifying the main verb in the clause. This is one case in which the
mutual exclusivity of word-class membership appears to be violated. The most common
examples of this type of construction involve the verbs gurinymi `make good' and ganjîmi
`finish', which can be used as modifiers meaning `well, properly' and `all' respectively. In
these constructions it is only the main verb that takes the tense inflection; the modifying verb
remains unmarked for tense. Some examples of these verbs functioning as adverbs, and also
as verbs, are:
  (3-9) a. Gunny-mi ng-u      gulug-ba.
           good-FAC 1SG.S-FUT sleep-FUT
           I will sleep well.
          b. Gunny-ma       ng-u.
             good-FAC.FUT 1SG.A-FUT
             I will fix it.
  (3-10) a. Gaj-ba gun-u        ganjimi.
            eat-FUT 3SG.M.A-FUT finish
            He will eat it all.
          b. Ganjima gun-u.
             finish.FUT 3SG.M.A-FUT
             He'll finish it.
   Examples of this type of construction with other modifying verbs include:
  (3-11) Barngala           ngi-n          mîrra.
         have.legs.crossed 1SG.S(PR)-PROG sit
         I'm sitting with my legs crossed.
  (3-12) Jirrbali        gî-n           nanîyaga      gulugbî.
         lie.on.stomach 3SG.S(PR)-PROG that.II.SG.NOM sleep
         She's sleeping on her stomach.
   The following examples demonstrate that these modifiers are verbs as well, since they are
capable of taking the future tense inflection and appearing alone without another verb:
   (3-13) Barngali-j-ba              giliyaga!
          have.crossed.legs-TH-FUT there
          Sit down with your legs crossed over there!
   (3-14) Jirrbali-j-ba!
          lie.on. stomach-TH-FUT
          Lie on your stomach!
52     Chapter 3   There is only one form that has doubtful status as a verb. This form, darridarri `be in a
line', is only ever found in the modifying function. It was not possible to get an example of
darrîdarri occurring alone.
     (3-15) Darridarri irri-n           mîrra.
            be.in.a.line 3PL.S(NP)-PROG sit
            They're sitting in a line.
     (3-16) Darrîdarri gîrr     garran-ba!
            be.in.a.line PL.IMP stand-FUT
            Stand in a line!
   However, rather than place darridarri in a word class of its own, I will consider it part of
the verb word class by analogy with other modifying verbs such as those in examples (3-11)
and (3-12) above.
     For a more detailed discussion of clauses containing two verbs see §7.4.1.","[68, 69, 70]"
"
4.7 LNDEFLNITE/INTERROGATIVES58
   There are five indefinite/interrogative roots in the corpus, which are used to indicate that
the (full) identity of the referent is unknown to the speaker. These forms are frequently used
in interrogative function, requesting the information about the referent's identity from the
addressee. This interrogative function, however, cannot be considered a part of the core
meaning of these forms as they can be used contexts that are not compatible with an
interrogative meaning, namely those in which they co-occur with the inferential enclitic =mijî
(see below).59 When combined with their various inflections, these five roots cover the
meanings 'someone, who', 'something, what', 'something, which', `for something, why',
'somewhere, where', `from somewhere, where from', 'some amount, how many/how
57 The alternation in the vowel of the stem is triggered by the following high back vowel of the dual suffix.
58 In Nordlinger 1993a I used the term 'ignorative' for this word class (following Karcevski 1969 and more
     recently Wierzbicka (e.g. 1980)). However, as Mushin (1991, 1995)   .      has pointed out, there are two
     components to these words: an ignorative component (which indicates that knowledge is at issue) and an
     epistemological component (which characterises the type of knowledge at issue). For this reason the
     more neutral term 'indefinite/interrogative' has been chosen. In other discussions of Australian languages
     these words have been referred to as `interrogatives' (e.g. Dixon 1972, 1977, Merlan 1994), 'inter-
     rogative/indefinite pronouns' (e.g. Austin 1981a, Morphy, 1983), 'indefinite pronouns' (Dench 1995),
     'indeterminates' (Donaldson 1980) and 'epistememes' (Mushin 1991, 1995).
59 This discussion has benefited from McGregor's (1990:146ff) discussion of such forms in Gooniyandi.
120 Chapter 4much', `sometime, when' and `somehow, how'.60 There is a strong tendency for indefinite/
interrogatives to be initial in the clause.
   As indicated by the term used, indefinite/interrogatives are found with two different
functions in the corpus: indefinite (4-249) and interrogative (4-250).61 In the former
function, they often co-occur with the enclitic -miji `INFER' (7.7.1.1).
   (4-249) Gayina=miji                       irr-a dîdîma.
             something.IV(ACC)=INFER 3PL.A-PST     tell
             They (must have) told him something./I don't know what they told him.
  (4-250) Gayina             irr-a       didima.
          something.IV(ACC) 3PL.A-PST tell
          They told him something./What did they tell him?
   Each of these examples expresses the fact that the speaker does not know what it was that
the subject told the object. As far as I can tell, the difference between the indefinite meaning
of example (4-249) and that of (4-250) is that in the former the speaker is indicating that
he/she is only inferring that anything was `told' at all. Such examples are often translated in
Aboriginal English using `must be', as in `I don't know what they told him, must be
something.'
   I will now discuss each of these indefinite/interrogatives individually. A general
interrogative particle is discussed in §7.5.1.","[137, 138]"

8.1 NON-FINITE SUBORDINATE CLAUSES
   Non-finite subordinate clauses are reduced clauses. They are reduced in four ways: (i)
they do not contain an auxiliary; (ii) they provide no information concerning tense, aspect and
mood; (iii) they are marked as subordinate with either the infinitive suffix or one of three
nominal case suffixes (see below); and (iv) their subject is obligatorily deleted under co-
reference with a main clause subject or object argument.
    There are three types of non-finite subordinate clauses in Wambaya: prior (the subordinate
clause situation precedes that of the main clause), simultaneous (the subordinate clause
situation is concurrent with that of the main clause) and purposive (the situation described by
the subordinate clause follows, and is the purpose of, that of the main clause). A system of
switch-reference operates when the two clauses are simultaneous. There is no switch-
reference in purposive subordinate clauses, and there is not sufficient data to determine the
situation for prior subordinate clauses.
   Table 8.1 shows the inflections that appear on verbs in non-finite subordinate clauses,
where SS (Same Subject) means that the (omitted) subject of the subordinate clause is co-
referential with that of the main clause and DS (Different Subject) means that the subject of the
subordinate clause is co-referential with the direct object of the main clause) For a discussion
of the form of these suffixes as verbal inflections see §6.1.
         TABLE 8.1: VERBAL INFLECTIONS IN NON-FINITE SUBORDINATE CLAUSES                                             SS                 DS

   As is clear in Table 8.1, the pattern of verbal marking in these clauses is complex. The
clearest case is when the two clauses are simultaneous; in this situation the ergativellocative
    More research is needed to determine whether the subject of the subordinate clause can be co-referential
    with a main clause NP other than subject or direct object (as it can in Warlpiri, for example (Hale 1976)).
    There is one example in the corpus in which a verb with this inflection is not in a simultaneous
    subordinate clause. In this example, (7-80), it functions as an argument of the verb ganjimi `finish
    doing'.

(8-2)) and the infinitive suffix -barda/-warda is used when the subordinate subject is co-
referential with the main clause direct object ((8-3) to (8-5)). Thus in this case there is switch-
reference.3 Simultaneous non-finite clauses usually function as adjuncts modifying the
subject ((8-1), (8-2)) or the object (8-3). The latter is particularly common with verbs of
perception ((8-4), (8-5)).4,5

   Since the subject of the subordinate clause is obligatorily controlled by a matrix NP, when
there are no co-referential arguments it is not possible to use a non-finite subordinate clause; a
finite clause must be used instead.

  The ablative case suffix -nnga is used in prior clauses (examples (8-7), (8-8)) (the few
examples of this type of clause in the corpus all have co-referential subjects). These can
    Dench and Evans (1988:30) argue that the use of what appears to be the locative case suffix to mark
    same subject occurs only in languages in which this suffix also marks ergative case and can therefore be
    seen to have arisen through a system of antecedant agreement with a main clause ergative subject, rather
    than being related to a locative function. Thus initially it would have appeared only in subordinate
    clauses controlled by main clause ergative subjects, and would then have extended to all subject-
    controlled subordinate clauses. While this may explain the development of this pattern of marking in
    languages such as Wambaya, in which ergative and locative functions are marked with one case suffix, it
    does not explain the use of the locative suffix to mark same subject in languages such as Jingili
    (Chadwick 1975) and Bilinara (Nordlinger 1990), in which ergative case and locative case are marked with
    separate suffixes.
    In this chapter I will use square brackets to identify the subordinate clause.
    An alternative analysis of these clauses with perception verbs is to treat them as object complements,
    analogous to the subject complements of certain intransitive verbs discussed in §7.2.2.

clause (8-7) or can describe the prior event that led to that of the main clause (8-8).6

   The dative case suffix -nka is used in purposive clauses (examples (8-9) and (8-10)).
These are usually adjuncts (8-10), but may also be verbal complements of certain verbs like
dirndirrimî `teach' (8-12). Purposive subordinate clauses differ from those mentioned above
in that an object NP does not simply appear in the same case that it would in a main clause,
but must be marked with dative case, like the verb ((8-9), (8-10)). The dative suffix -nka is
used in any purposive clause, regardless of whether the subordinate subject is co-referential
with the subject or object NP in the matrix clause. Thus, there is no switch-reference in
purposive clauses.

   A few ditransitive verbs, however, take an indirect object inflected with the allative case;
these are yardi `put O in/on I0',13 burlugardi `soak O in IO' and garnarnda `send O to I0'.
     (7-97)   Garnguja      ng-a        yardi manganyma ngangarrgi-nmanji.

     (7-99)   Guyala ng-udi            garnanuia gunyanga-nmanji.

              I won't send her to another (girl).
   In some contexts, where the location is either clear or irrelevant, the indirect objects of
yardî and burlugardi may be omitted. In this case, yardî is interpreted as meaning `put O
down':14
     (7-100) Yardi ng-a.
             put ISG.A-PST
             I put it down.
     (7-101) Burlugardî ngi-n.
             soak       IGG.A(PR)-PROG
             I'm soaking it.
   Like some dative-marked indirect objects, the allative indirect object of yardi can feed
reflexive/reciprocal constructions.15 In the following example, taken from Text 2 in
I3  There is one example, from Text 5 in Appendix A, in which yardi appears with a complement inflected
    with the locative case, rather than the allative case:
      llvirrga         gin-aji             yardi gayangga-ni.
      leaf.IV(NOM) 3SG.M.A-HAB.PST put high-LOC
      He'd put the leaves on top.
14 Note that this use of yardi, in which the indirect object has been ellipsed, must be distinguished from the
    transitive use of yardi, in which it means 'make'. In this latter use yardi does not take an indirect object.
    Consider the following example from Appendix A, Text I:
      Yangula ny-a             jundurra      bajbaga       yardi.
      NEG        2SG.A-PST dust.IV(ACC) big.IV(ACC) make
      You didn't make much dust.
                                                                          Syntax of simple sentences   191Appendix A, the fact that the reflexive bound pronoun represents an allative argument is
shown by the presence of allative case on the secondary predicate wara 'face', which agrees
with the allative indirect object.
  (7-102) Wara-nmanji gini-ngg-a                    yardi bulinja.
            face.IV-ALL         3SG.M.A-RR-NF put               algae.IV(ACC)
            He put algae on his face.
   One verb, dîdima 'tell 02 to O, tell O to I0', can appear in either type of simple ditransitive
frame. In both cases it subcategorises for an (accusative) cognate object referring to the story
told. However, the recipient can be expressed by either an accusative object (example (7-
103)) or by a derive indirect object ((7-104), (7-105)). As with the other ditransitive verbs
discussed above, only in the former case is the recipient registered in the auxiliary.
  (7-103) Didima ngiyi-ng-a                  marranya.
            tell       3SG.NM.A-1O-NF yarn.IV(ACC)
            She told me a yam.
  (7-104) Buwarraja                 ngiy-a         didima ngarra.
            dreaming.IV(ACC) 1SG.A-PST tell                ISGOBL

            dreaming.IV(ACC) ISG.A-PST tell         boy.I-DAT
            I told the boy a dreaming story.
   The 'o2-theme' case frame, as in (7-103), is the most common and is pragmatically less
marked. The effect of using the '0-theme' case frame, as in (7-104) and (7-105), appears to
be to focus more on the recipient of the telling. However, more research is needed.
   Both didima and janganja have alternative case frames containing clausal arguments,
discussed in §8.2.1.3. Didima, dîrndirrinmyî and garnarnda also allow case frames with
verbal complements; see below.","[207, 208, 209]"
