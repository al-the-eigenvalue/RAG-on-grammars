                   Chapter I
            Summary of Structure
     I.      Phonology.    Words are only composed of the
syllables CV, CV*, CVC, and CV*C in canonical shape.
The words generally range from monosyllabic to
quadrisyllabic with some rare forms which are
slightly longer.
     Wintu words are phonologically marked by a
word juncture /+/, which comprehends a contour.
Primary stress, usually on the first syllable, may....
be deferred to a following prominent heavy syllable
with a long vowel, and thus is never functional, but
is predicted in terms of juncture and other features.
     There are 30 consonant phonemes including four
anomalous ones which are not part of the minimal
contrastive system for all idiolects. Three of
                               i
these are recent borrowings from English, while one
seems to be an autonomous development in the direc­
tion of greater pattern symmetry, albeit with some
support from English.     Consonants may be classed
according to several criteria as limited/unlimited
in distribution, simple/coarticulated, stopped/
continuant, oral/nasal, participant/non-participant
in phonologically conditioned morphophonemic alter­
nations; but essentially what at first appears to
be an asymmetrical collocation is in fact a highly
integrated system -- a system integrated by both
oppositions and crosscutting unities.   Distribu­
tional and phonetic ranges are strikingly parallel,
not only allophonically, but phonemically and morpho
phonemically as well.
     Vowels occur in five phonemic quality ranges
and two contrastive quantities.    Length is analyzed,
for reasons of distribution and pattern congruity,
as a prosodic and phonemically separable unit.      Abun
dant minimal pairs may be demonstrated for all pho­
nemes.
     In addition to the prosodic feature of vowel
length and the non-phonemic stress, there are five
additional suprasegmental features: four phonemic
junctures and one phonemic phrasal pitch supra-
segment.   Other ideolectal, dialectal, and stylistic
features have not been phonemicized.
     II.        Morphophonemics.   There are two kinds of
phonomechanical processes to be noted: first, the
simplification of consonantal sequences resulting
from morpheme combination, specifically through
elision and modification, and second, syncopation
at morpheme boundaries.
     The most extensive phonological processes,
however, affect vowels and involve harmony, ablaut,
and lengthening.    These modifications are not
phonomechanical but are induced by specific
morphological elements.
     III.          Morphology. Wintu structure is rather
synthetic, the technique of synthesis being mainly
agglutinative, but characterized also by a certian
amount of fusion and symbolism.    The most important
morphological processes are (in order of importance)
suffixation, vocalic ablaut, and reduplication, with
very limited amounts of prefixation, compounding,
consonant abluat, proclisis, postclisis, and, rarely,
suppletion.   Wintu thus stands between Takelma and
Yokuts, two other previously described Penutian
languages, in that it has less formal apparatus than
Takelma and more than Yokuts, but more derivational
apparatus than Takelma and perhaps less than Yokuts.
     Morphs characteristically have the shape C, *C,
V, V*, CV, VC, CVC, and CV*C.     Longer sequences of
syllables up to a maximum of three occur, however,
in the case of loan words and reduplicated forms.
Morphemes are combined in sequences which may he
defined as morphemic words in terms of fixed order
criteria, i.e., a sequence of morphemes whose order is
fixed relative to each other constitutes a morphemic
word.    For the most part the boundaries of morphemic
and phonemic words coincide, giving full words.
Morphemic words which are not also phonemic words
constitute a different type of unit designated clitic.
Clitics also differ from full words in their syntactic
properties.     The major order of morpheme classes within
the word is based on a nuclear morpheme cluster (stem
or theme) preceeded maximally by two position classes
of optional occurrence (directionals and locationals)
and followed by a limited number of position classes
of derivational and, finally, inflectional suffixes.
        The morphologically defined word classes are
verbs, substantives, sentence connectives, and
uninflected words.     Most radicals can occur with both
verb and substantive derivation and inflection, while
some appear limited to only one class membership.      A
few radicals occur in one of the first two classes and
in the third class as well.     Verbs and substantives are
characterized by their distinctive inflections, sentence
                                                              31
connectives by their roots, while the uninflected
words always occur in a fixed (invariant) form.     Of
these classes the verb is the most complex as regards
morphological and phonological structure.
     Three main classes of verbs are distinguished:
auxilaries, independent verbs (including a subclass of
adjectival verbs), and dependent verbs.
     Fundamental (unanalyzable) root morphemes with
semantically general meanings —   many of which, on the
submorphemic level, show partial semantic and formal
resemblances of a symbolic nature which may be only
partially analyzable diachronically -- are mostly
monosyllabic, although some disyllabic consonantal roots
and a few triconsonantal loans are found.    Stems composed
of a root plus a vocalic stem-forming suffix almost
always contain two vowels.   The root vowel may undergo
ablaut changes, the ablaut grade in each instance
being determined by the following vowel.    Most verbs
show three stems: indicative, imperative, and nominal.
     Three major types of verbal affixes are distinguished:
prefixes of direction (a very limited number); suffixes
of derivational function (also limited in number) in
several position classes; and suffixes of inflectional,
word-forming function in one final position class, the
member morphemes of which are obligatore and mutually
exclusive.   Verbs can be considered to be marked for
two persons although it appears clear that they were
historically inflected for first person only, the
other person being covertly marked only by certain
suffixes which occur elsewhere with other functions.
Verbs may be morphologically marked for various
categories: person, subordination, plurality, evidence,
negation, exhortation, voice, completion, dubitation,
interrogation, and denomination, although some of these
categories are also expressed in more complex
periphrastic constructions employing auxilary verbs.
Auxilary verbs mark aspect, tense, mode, and possibility.
     The substantive, especially the pronoun, is more
complex in inflection, but less complex in derivation,
than the verb.
     Substantives are formed largely from deverbatives
composed of verb stems plus nominalizing elements or
from roots with no further analyzable derivation, or
from compoun stems.     To these roots, stems, or compound
stems, the inflectional suffixes marking aspect, case,
and number are added.
     Not all substantives are inflected for all
categories however.     Differences in inflection divide
the substantive into two classes: nouns and pronouns.
Nouns are inflected for two aspects, one two, or four
morphological cases, and, rarely, for two numbers.
Nouns are themselves subdivided into inalienably
possessed nouns, alienable possessed nouns, and non­
possessed postclitics; inalienably possessed nouns
obligatorily occur with one of a small number of
prefixes.    Alienably possessed nouns are further
subdivided
into a number of subclasses on the basis of formal
differences in derivation and inflection.      PronOuns
are inflected for two aspects, three numbers, and
various cases.   Like nouns, they are subdivided on
the basis of formal differences in derivation and
inflection into three subclasses: personal, inter­
rogative, and demonstrative.      Personal pronouns
distinguish four persons, except in the singular
                           i
where only three are distinguished. While there
is a great proliferation of personal pronouns, they
are rarely employed and not all series are complete
for all categories.
     Uninflected words include proclitics, exclam-
atives, conjunctions, and adverbials, all distin­
guished by their syntactic function.
     IV.         Syntax.     The largest syntactic unit is
the sentence.    Sentences consist of arrangements
of morphologically defined words terminated by a
period juncture /./.       These arrangements of words
are of two types depending on the morphological
class of their members.       The presence or absence
of a word belonging to the morphological class
verb separates them into clauses and phrases.
Clauses, which are terminated by a comma juncture /,/
except when occurring sentence finally, obligatorily
contain verbs.     Phrases obligatorily contain nouns,
and never verbs.    Clauses are of two types: dependent
and independent, contingent on the type of inflectional
ending forming the verb, that is, on whether the verb
contained is dependent or independent.     Independent
verbs take the personal inflectional suffixes, whereas
dependent verbs are formed by subordinating inflectional
suffixes which are mutually exclusive with those of
person.
        Two types of sentences are defined in terms of
restrictions on occurrence: independent and dependent
ones.     Independent sentences may introduce a discourse
or may in themselves constitute a discourse.     Dependent
sentences never constitute a discourse or occur first in
discourse, but only occur following independent
sentences.    Independent sentences contain obligatorily
one independent clause, and optionally other independent
and dependent clauses as well as phrases.     Dependent
sentences never contain an independent clause, but may
contain, or consist of any other clause or phrase, or
may even consist of a single word.
        Clauses and phrases are composed of four types of
syntactic units —   heads, attributives, satellites,
and conjunctions -- established on the basis of
dependence and agreement relation and syntactic function.
Conjunctions connect words, phrases, and clauses.
Satellites.include: forms which function as subject,
object, or possessor and show instrumental, locative,
or quotative relations.    The heads of clauses are
always verbs, of phrases, nouns.    Words unilaterally
dependent on the heads of clauses and phrases are
attributives.   Attributives of nouns are adjectival
in function, attributives of verbs are adverbial and
auxilary in function.
     While the ordering of clauses and phrases in
a sentence is free, within clauses and phrases the
word order of the attributives of nouns, auxilary
attributives, conjunctions, and one type of
satellite is restricted.    Adverbial attributives and
other satellites are free to occur at any word
boundary although certain positions seem to be
statistically preferred.    Thus the order of occurrence
of the auxilary attributives of the verb, of which there
may be a maximum of five co-occurring within an
independent clause, is rigidly fixed with respect to
the main verb and to each other.    Attributives of nouns
always precede the noun head they modify.     The
                                                              37conjunction is usually the first word in the second
of the two syntactic units being connected, and the
quotative demonstrative pronoun immediately follows
a quotation.
     The most important types of syntactic relations
are concord (agreement) and dependence.     The substan­
tival morphological cases play a relational role in
marking subjects, objects, instrumentality, location,
and possession, expressing these functions differently
in active and passive constructions.     The relation of
noun heads to their attributives, verbs to substantives,
and various other syntactic functions are indicated
by concord in their respective morphological cases.
     While a great deal of specificity in expression
is possible, only certain semantic areas are overtly
dealt with in great detail.   Verbal categories are many
and detailed and primarily obligatory in their expression,
while ellipsis in substantival categories is a prominent
part of the syntax.   Inference plays a large role in the
latter case although specification is possible for
emphasis and clarification.   Thus unless overtly marked
for person, the first predication in a discourse is
assumed to be in the first person.     First person markers
are only introduced for emphasis or to express number.
Overtly expressed subjects and objects are, in general,
not typical; they are rather incorporated semantically
                                           I
in the verb, that is, the meaning of the verb implies
a certain object or subject.*   Conjunctions are then
employed to indicate maintainence or reversal of
subject - object relations in successive predications.
The large number of pronominal forms are generally
restricted in function to the expression of number,
emphasis, or contrast, and are infrequently used.
Certain substantival qualifies of animateness, number,
dispersal, and individuality, as well as contrast
between groups are made explicit through the use of the
formal category of noun aspect and the disjunctive
proclitic.
     In an analogous way certain overtly expressed
obligatory categories of verbs, such as evidence, are
the focus of formal expression (parallel to noun
aspect), while other categories, such as tense are
not typically marked.","[29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44]"
"     2.3.        Syllable.   The syllable is determined
on the basis of the following criteria: consistent
informant syllabation of sequences of segmental
phonemes with obligatory single consonant onset
followed by a peak of sonority associated with a
vowel nucleus of long or short vowel:, coterminous
with stress and pitch phenomena, and optionally
followed by a single consonant.   No initial or final
consonant clusters occur within one syllable, and
no heterophonous vowel clusters ever occur.   The
syllabic can is thus CV(*)(C).
     Examples are:
     CV          / W           'and, or'
     CV •        /mi*/         1tree'
     CVC         /nuq/         pus'
     CV*C        /ba* s/       1food'     Clusters of consonants occur only when a
syllable ending in a consonant is immediately
followed by another syllable; these may be
homophonous or heterophonous but there are no
examples of homophonous clusters uninterrupted
by a juncture.
     Examples are*
     CVCGVC        /pot$om/           'poison oak1
     CVC-CV*C     /net-ta*n/          'my father'
     CVC-CVC      /^el-^ih/           'you put it ini1
                     Chapter III
                Morphonemics
     1.   The phonological shape of morphemes is affected
by four factors:     adjacent phonemes, adjacent morphemes,
speed, and dialect.     Only those variations in the shapes
of morphemes which are pervasive and conditioned by ad­
jacent phonemes will be considered morphophonemic; all
morphologically conditioned alternation and that condi­
tioned by speed will be separately described for each
morpheme concerned, while dialect variation will be given
in the dictionary.     There are two types of phonologically
conditioned variation;     variation in sequences of phonemes
and variation in morphological shape dependent on the
phonological environment.      Phonologically conditioned va­
riation in the shapes of individual morphemes is discussed
under each pertinent morpheme, and is only described here
if it be pervasive.
     There are two types of sequential morphophonemic
variation:   contraction and ablaut.    Contraction involves
the simplification of consonant clusters, with one ex­
ception, at morpheme boundaries.      Consonant clusters are
of two types:   homophonous and heterophonous.    Morpheme
combination resulting in a morphophonemic homophonous
cluster is always realized as a single consonant.      It is
possible, however, for an informant to produce a geminate
consonant to emphasize and clarify a form.             Examples are;
     flheketto•ti      /heketo*t/          'anyone'
     Q’elewwarfl       /^elewar/           'not'
     D^el-^ihheresfl      /^el-^iheres/       'something put inside'
     In word final position a morphophonemic sequence of
voiced continuants /l/ or /r/ followed hy /h/ is
realized phonemically as a single spirant:
     Qlhfl     /X/     IcilhO      /ciX/    'bear'
     Qrhfl     /©/     flnurhfl    /nu8/    'salmon'
     In medial position a morphophonemic sequence of /r/
plus /s/, /n/, or any lateral, /l/ followed by a lateral,
/n/ followed by /l/, /w/ followed by /h/, or /t/ fol­
lowed by / c/ is phonemically realized as the second of
the two consonants.
     Examples are;
drsQ:/s/      flnor sonofl;/nosono/         'South hose,' a sp. place
drnfl:/n/     Jpur nenfl;/punen/            'his mother'
drlfl:/l/     Ipur la»hfl:/pula»h/          'his older sister'
flrX|:/X/     flpur Xabe•|;/puXabe•/        'his older brother'
flix|:/x/    fl^el-XeXe* [|j/9eXeXe»/       'to throw things back
                                            and forth'
01^fl;/A/    fl9ol-Xurad j/’oiura/          'to pile rocks up*
UnlJls/l/    flwin lei Q;/wilel/            'let's see'
Qwhfls/h/    J^uw hetanfl ;/*?uhetan/       'anyway'
dtcfl:/c/    dyet    cufl:/yecu/            'name i t i'     There is one example of simplification of a
heterophonous two consonant cluster within a morpheme
no longer synchronically analyzable into two morphemes.
            flt^U:/?/            Qpot^comfl :/po^om/   'poison oak'
     There are two types of ablaut, vocalic and con­
sonantal.      Vocalic ablaut involves a variation in vowel
quality conditioned by the preceding or following vowel.
It is represented by three morphophonemes.
     The morphophoneme flIfl is phonemically /i/ preceding
/a/, and /e/ preceding /i/, /u/, / e/, or /o/.
          fllllaflj/lila/j flllluH:/lelu/; QlllitS:/lelit/
     The morphophoneme             flufl is phonemically /u/ preceding
/a/, and /o/ preceding /i/, /u/, /e/, or /o/.
          |dUya •[!:/duya •/ ; fldlJyul :/doyu/; fldUyifl:/doyi/
     The morphophoneme             OvD is phonemically a short vowel
of the same quality as the immediately preceding vowel.
If that vowel is flIQ they are both realized phonemically
as /e/;    if it is flufl they are both /o/.
     Consonant ablaut only involves the bilabial stops.
Before junctures and affricates the voiced bilabial /b/
is realized as the unaspirated voiceless bilabjaL /p/.
           flcu •b fl:/ cu •p/     'awl'
           flcubcubukus1:/cupcubukus/             'chipmunk1
     There are two types of pervasive, phonologically
conditioned variation in the shapes of individual
morphemes.      The stem II verb suffixes {u*}, {e«}, {i*}»
and {i *1} have the shape V»(C) following consonantsand wV(*C) following vowels.               The substantival case
suffixes [umj and [un], and the stem II inflectional
suffix {t } have the shape VC following consonants
and C following vowels.

                   Morphology
     1.   Words and Word Classes.   Words may be
defined for Wintu on the basis of the morphological
criterion of the occurrence of morphemes in an
order which is fixed relative to each other.       That
is, there are position classes of morphemes which
occur in invariant sequence.    The unit defined as
a morphological word is used as a distributional
frame, for determining the relative position classes
of morphemes.   With one exception, these position
classes contain inventories of morphemes which are
limited in membership.   The class with unlimited
membership is the root, those preceding it in
sequence are prefixes, and those following it
in sequence are suffixes.   Only one position class,
that of the root, is always obligatorily filled
in all forms.   But the presence of certain position
classes conditions the obligatory filling of others.
While the position classes are not morphemes, each
position class has a class meaning and the elements
contained within a class constitute a set with common
distributional properties, that is privileges of
occurrence, and are mutually exclusive..
     Much affixation results in forms which are
endocentric, that is, which have the same external
distributional properties as at least one of the
component morphemes, from which a layered or
cyclical procession of formations typically ensues.
Many forms are then composed of distributionally
similar forms which in turn have like components.
The cycle may be interrupted at many points by the
addition of certain types of suffixes, or may
continue through several cycles of stem formation.
     Non-root morphemes are thus of two types:
derivational and inflectional.   Derivational
morphemes combine with roots to make stems or
indicate that a previously formed stem is to
be reinterpreted as a radical, i.e. as a single
morphological unit to which the same type of
material may be suffixed in the cyclical fashion
described above.   Inflectional morphemes indicate
                                                                80
that the stem can no longer he so reinterpreted,
interrupting the cycle of derivation.
        Only suffixes are inflectional, while prefixes,
reduplication, and consonant ablaut as well as suffixes
are derivational.     Both derivational and inflectional
suffixes may occur as the final morpheme in a morphemic
word.    However, members of the final position class of
inflectional suffixes may only occur finally, while
one position class of derivational suffixes may
optionally occur finally, being also capable of being
followed by other derivational and inflectional material.
        The combination of morphemes into words involves
suffixation, prefixation, compounding, reduplication,
consonantal and vocalic ablaut, and suppletion.
Suffixation is the major process of morpheme combina­
tion, being extensively used for derivation and the only
process used for inflection.     Prefixation is limited
and occurs only with derivational value.     Compounding
is limited to the combination of single morphemes,
roots, to formsequences which function externally as
roots, called radicals; a juxtaposition yielding
endocentric, co-ordinate compounds.     Reduplication
involves only one class of morphemes, roots, and has but
a single function, that of marking iteration.     Consonantal
ablaut which appears to have been a very active process
in the past (See Sec. 5.) is synchronically analyzable
in a few examples where it is purely derivational in
function.    There are two types of vocalic ablaut:
phonologically conditioned harmonic variation of the
root vowel of stems, and morphologically conditioned
alternance in the vowels of steia ultima preceding certain
suffixes.    The phonologically conditioned variation has
been described in Chapter II (See   fllQ, flufl).   The
morphologically conditioned alternance is described for
each morpheme with allomorphs showing morphologically
conditioned vocalic ablaut.    (See {here} passive,
{nthere} non-visual sensorial evidential, {kele}
hearsay evidential, and the auxiliaries {bly}, bVh},
and {wlr}.    Suppletion, like vocalic ablaut, functions
allomorphically, that is a few morphemes have suppletive
allomorphs.
     Three morphological classes of words are
distinguished on the basis of differences in
inflection.     Two of the classes, substantives
and verbs, are marked by different sets of
final position inflectional morphemes, while the
third class is uninflected.     Most stems may
occur with either substantive or verb inflection,
although some msy occur with only one type of
inflection and a few never occur with inflectional
suffixes.     A small number of stems may occur
as either verbs or substantives or uninflectad
forms.
     The final position class of inflectional
suffixes diagnostic of verbs contains 15 members.
They are:
{ el} the evidential of logical deduction, experiential
{da} 1st person suffix of selfness
{m} dubitative
{k} repeatedly in past time
{^a} anteriority
{•£an} contradictory simultaneity
fsken}   second person
{di} 3rd person hortative
{u*} 1st person optative-interrogative
{n} subordinating ""while""
{ta} subordinating, temporal simultaneity or
     anteriority ""while""
{so} ""before"" necessary anteriority
{t} personal object
{we*} 1st dual hortatory
{i«} interrogative
     The final position class of substantives
contains 5 members which are diagnostic of this
class.   They are:
 {um} object case suffix
 {un} genitive case suffix
 {in} locative case suffix
 {r} instrumental case suffix
 {t} possessive case suffix
    Both verbs and substantives are further
subdivided on the basis of formal criteria.       The
classes and subclasses of morphological words thus
distinguished are charted below.

     2.     Verbs
     2.1.     Verb structure.    The sequences of morphemes
to which the verbal inflectional endings are added
constitute the verb stem.       The verb stern consists of two
elements: an optionally final position class of verb
stem formants and a radical complex.       The radical complex
consists either of a root, or of a root plus one
optional position class of root-deriving suffixes, and
two optional position classes of prefixes, or of a
radical, that is a form consisting of one of four
position classes of radical forming morphemes suffixed
to a previously formed stem.
     Verbs are divided into a number of classes and sub­
classes depending on the number of stems they show, i.e.
the number of stem formants with which they cor»occur,
and the particular allomorph each ste;,; formant has when
suffixed to them.     The majority of verbs show three
stem forms.     A small number show only two stem forms,
while a smaller group has only one stem.       The classes
of verbs are charted below in terms of the number of
stem formants with which each class may occur,
and the particular allomorph of each stem formant
morpheme which occurs with it.
                  i
     The auxiliaries do not fit into any of these
subclasses of conjugational types, but are quite
aberrant, each one virtually constituting a
separate class.       Their conjugational stem forms
are therefore individually described in the
discussion of auxiliaries.

     Typically, verb stems are disyllabic in shape,
although one monosyllabic verb stem (ba« 'to eat')
is found, and some auxiliary verb stems are
contracted to monosyllables, while many of the
stems produced by internal derivation are longer.
These longer stems behave just like the disyllabic
stems in terms of external derivation and inflection.
The major, disyllabic type is based on a mono­
syllabic root CVC or CV*C to which is suffixed a
stem formant vowel, which varies for specific
stem class and verb class.
     Monosyllabic roots of similar phonemic shape
which occur with various conjugation subclass
membership, taking different allomorphs of the stem
formant {a}, frequently show variations in vowel
length, and often show tantalizingly similar meanings
which often appear to involve a contrast in transitive
versus intransitive, or iterative versus single or
punctual.   The variations in meaning and form do
not seem to be synchronically consistent, however,
and no attempt at segmentation has been made.    An
example of thiB type of partial resemblance is found
in the examples of conjugational subtypes in the two
forms /co*r/ 'to open nuts' and /co*ra/ 'burrs to open'
Although the composition of the monosyllabic
sequences occupying the radical position has not
been found susceptible to synchronic analysis,
the partial patterns of derivation apparent within
these sequences seem, at least diachronically,
to have been determining for conjugation class
membership.   More extensive analysis possibly based
on further field work might make clearer the
synchronic and diachronic patterns of relation­
ship between conjugational subclasses on the one
hand and the seeming relationship in form and
meaning between individual radicals on the other.
     The three stem formant morphemes constitute
a single class both positionally and functionally.
They form stems from radicals, occurring obligatorily
before any inflectional suffixes and after any
radical forming suffixes, and after all but a few
roots aid root deriving suffixes.   They are the only
class of derivational morphemes which may be a
final position class, occurring finally if the verb
is not inflected.   One of the stem formants,   {u},
may occur as many as five times within a form if
the radical consists of a number of radical
derived stems.    However, the last occurrence of a
stem formant invariably signals that the derivational
process is terminated for that form.
     The stem formant {a} marks the indicative or
Stem I form of verbs.     This is the form quoted in
the dictionary.     It is commonly translated as an
infinitive in English and is the form most likely
to be elicited.    The morpheme {a} has four allomorphs,
/a/, /a*/, /e/, and /e*/f which are morphologically
conditioned by the class of radical to which they
are affixed.     Thus (a} has the allomorph /a/ when
suffixed to verb classes A, E, F, G, I, J, and M.
It is only suffixed to members of classes F and
G, however, if inflectional suffixes are also added.
     [a} has the allomorph /a»/ when suffixed to
verb classes B and K, the allomorph /e/ when suffixed
to class H, and the allomorph /e*/ when suffixed
to classes C, D, and L.     The stem formant {a} is
optionally followed by two position classes of
inflectional suffixes.
        Examples of each allomorph are;
/a/:     [ca-w}   {a}    /ca*wa/-      'to sing'
/a*/*       ftay} {a}     /baya*/      'to cauterize'
/e/j     {cuq} {a}       /cuqe/        'to help'
/&'/:       {huy} [a}     /huye*/      'to save, hoard'
/a/ when followed hy inflectional suffixes:
         {co*r} {a} {da}      /co*rada/       'I open nuts'
hut      {co*r}               /co*r/          'to open nuts'
        The stem formant [u} marks the imperative or
Stem II form of verbs, a freely elicited form,
translated as the simple or imperative form of an
English verb.        It has five morphologically conditioned
allomorphs: /u/, /e/, /a/, /h/,, and stem vowel ablaut.-*
The morpheme {u} is marked by stem vowel ablaut for class
E, and for the future intentional auxiliary (wlrj.
In both cases the vowel involved is one characterized by
a morphophonemic variation in quality (Q13; /i/             /e/,
and flufl: /u/-^/o/).      In class E the imperative stem is
signaled by the presence of the lower quality phonemic
variant of the morphophoneme: /e/ if the stem vowel if
fllfl, /°/ if        stem vowel is BuQ.     Interestingly
enough, this is the
■* Stem II forms of monosyllabic shape are lengthened
      to V* before suffixation.
stem shape which would he phonologically conditioned
if the /u/ allomorph of the second stem formant {u}
were suffixed.     The vowel ablaut marking the
imperative stem of the future intentional auxiliary
{wlr}, however, is unparalleled in the language,
the second stem form being signaled by the presence
of /a/.   The morpheme {u} has the shape /h/ when
suffixed to the two auxiliary verbs of doing {9uw}
and {?iy}.    It has the shape /e/ when suffixed
to a verb of class L, and the shape /a/ when
suffixed to one of cla6s K.     It has the shape /u/
when suffixed to members of classes A, B, C, D, P,
G-, H, I, and J.    The morpheme {u} is only suffixed
to members of classes F, H, and I if inflectional
suffixes are also added.     The stem formant {u} may
be followed   by up to four optional position classes
of derivational suffixes, and three position classes
of inflectional suffixes.     If followed by more than
one position class of derivational suffix, the
morpheme {u} also obligatorily recurs between each
two derivational suffixes.     The stem formant {u}
never occurs with the verb 'to go'     {har}.
                                                                       94
       Examples of each allomorph are:
Vowel Ablaut:      {cUtj   {u}   /cot/      'Undo I' ■/V
/h/:               {9iw} (u}      [l^iwhO / 9ih/   ’do it (nearby)'.'
/e/:              [huy}    {u}   /huye/     'save, hoard I'
/a/:              {cin}    {u]   /cina/     'defecate 1'
/u/:              {ca*w} {u}     /ca*wu/    'sing!'
/u/ when followed by inflectional suffixes:
                   {90 *r} {u} [n|    /coTun/         'while opening
                                                   nuts'
but                                   /co*r/          'open nuts!'
       The stem formant {i} marks the nominal or Stem III
form of verbs.     This form which i£ only indirectly
elicitable, translates as a participle or nominal
indicating the completion of action, the product of
action, or the instrument or object of an action.            This
stem is not distinguished in verb classes I, J, K, L, and M.
The morpheme {i} has four morphologically conditioned
allomorphs:     /i/, /e/, /•/» and Dvfl.    It has the shape
/i/ when suffixed to members of verb classes A, B, and
0, the shape /e/ when suffixed to members of verb class D,
the shape /•/ when suffixed to the negative auxiliary
/9elew/ and the perfective auxiliary {suk}, and the shape
of a short vowel identical in quality with that of the
final root vowel when suffixed to members of verb classes
                                                                             95
    E, E, G, and H.        The stem formant {i } may ""be followed
    by two position classes of inflectional suffixes.
    When the allomorphs of (ij are /e/, /•/» or flvfl, it
    is obligatorily followed by one of the two suffixes marking
    substantive aspect, {s} or {t }.
             Examples of the allomorphs of stem formant {i] are;
    /i/:      [ca*w} {i}         /ca*wi/    'song, singing'
    /e/j      [cicj {i} {s } /cices/        'being sharp pointed,
                                            that which is sharp
                                            pointed'
    /*/s      {suk} {i}    {s}   /su*s/     'standing, being, those
                                            standing'
    QV fl:     {cUt} (i} [s]     QpUtVsQ   /cotos/      'undoing'
             The radical complex to which the stem formants
    are initially suffixed consists maximally of four
    position classes of morphemes: two optional classes
    of prefixes, an obligatory class of roots, and one
    optional class of root-deriving suffixes.             The optional
    prefixes are directional in meaning.             The optional suffixes
    qualify the meaning of the radical as regards plurality
    or the status of the subject.i
    The sixteen members of the first position
class of prefixes are optional in occurrence,
directional in meaning^ and mutually exclusive.
When affixed directly to roots (except {X} ’to sit'
they are followed by a hyphen juncture, which is
not present when they are followed by the second
optional position class of prefixes.        These prefixe
are listed below in alphabetical order, together
with their specific meanings.

        /xun-wana*/         'to come closer, approach'
{$al}         'other, apart, separately'
        /$al-q,olti*na/        'to talk a different,
                               foreign language'
{$an}        'away, off'
        /£an-kuda/         'to go away, step off'
{yay}        'around, encircling'
        /yay-lamirta/        'to go round and round'
{yel}        'back'
        /yel‘?ol-thamuma*/        'push deer head
                                  decoy back Tip'
{*?el}       'in, in horizontally, intensively'
        /‘’el-taqa/        'to spank'
        / 9el-kuda/        'to step in the house'
     The second optional position class has two
members which are also mutually exclusive and di­
rectional in meaning.        They are always followed
by a hyphen juncture except when prefixed to the
root [X} 'to sit'.        They are:
     {ken}        'down, in'
             /ken\a»/        'to sit down'
             /wayken-kuda/         'to enter the door'
             /xunken-pana/         'to get down here'
     {9ol}        'up, above'
             /9ol-saca/         ’to lift up'
             /yel9ol-thamuma•/         'push deer head
                                       decoy back up'
     The largest single position class, the only
one which is universally obligatory in occurrence,
is that of the root.        It is open in membership
and its members are characterized by having lexical
meanings.     Roots are typically monosyllabic in shape.
Two roots, {X } 'to sit', and {b} 'to eat' consist
of a single consonant.        Other roots have the
shapes CVC, or CV*C.        Roots may be directly
followed by the stem formants or one of the optional
class of root-deriving suffixes.
     Root derivation is accomplished by reduplication
and suffixation.     There are five root deriving
                                                         i
suffixes which constitute a single position class
of optional occurrence, and one optional process
of root derivation.      Both the suffixes (with one
exception,    {el}) and the reduplication are
obligatorily followed by one of the stem formants.
The suffix {el} is obligatorily followed only by the
stem formant {i }, the stem formants {a} and {u}
only occurring with it if followed by inflectional
suffixes.
     The derivational process of reduplication of
the root morpheme marks plurality of an intensive,
iterative, distributive, or numerical type, and
is correspondingly translated.       The reduplication
of roots having the shape CVC and CV»C takes the
shape CVCCVC.     The two single consonant roots {X}
and {b} are never reduplicated.
     Examples are:
     {bal}        'tell a lie'
             /balbala/       'tell all kinds of stories'
     {xi*n}        'sleep'
             /xinxina/       'many to sleep'
     {wlr}       'come'
             /wirwira-be*m/            'many are corning1
     {har]       'go'
             /harhara-be»m/            'many are going'
     {ti*n}       . 'talk*
             /tintin/         'chat'
     {kow}       'hit'
             /kowkowa/         '(to) hammer)
     The root-deriving suffix {VIVlVh}, the
distributive pluralizer, commonly translates
'many separately to...'.         It has two phonologically
conditioned variants, flVlVhQ after /l/, and flVlVlVhfl
elsewhere.     It is suffixed directly to the root
and must be followed by a stem formant.
     Examples are:
     /ceweleleha/            'many to be wide open'
     /bo*loloha/             'to pulverize'
     /xi‘nililiha/           'many to sleep separately'
     The root-deriving suffix {V»r}, the time/space
extended continuative pluralizer, commonly
translates as 'to ... repeatedlyto ... continuously.
Long root vowels are shortened before this suffix.
It is suffixed directly to the root and must be
followed by a stem formant.
     Examples are:
     {kUp}        'chop withinstrument      or     tool'
             /kopo'ra/     'to run with tail cut in half'
     {kum}        'eat crunchy     thingsintermittently'
             /kumu»ra/     'eat crunchy things continuously'
     {pUn}        'leap'
             /pono»ra/     'run'
     {•£uqj       'spot'
             /•^oqo»ra/    'to be spotted all      over'
     {ku*m}        'water to roar'
             /kumu»ra/     'waterfalls roar'
     {te»l}        '(to) skin off,     scab off'
             /teleTa-hara•./         'bald headed ones to move'
     r *   i
     (ci*mj        'to blink, shut     lids of eyes'
             /cimi*ra/     'blink fast, repeatedly'
     The root-deriving suffix {V*y} is iterative
              I
of action or object of the action, and is
correspondingly translated.         Like the suffix (V*rj,
long root vowels are shortened before this suffix.
[V*y} is suffixed directly to the root and is
obligatorily followed by a stem formant.
    Examples are:
     [cUr]        'skin nuts'
             /coro*ya/       'many to be skinned'
     [te*l]        '(to) skin off, scab off'
             /tele*ya/       'many to be bald'
     {daq}        'scorch'
             /daqa*ya/       many to get burned'
     [cUd]        'be chapped'
              ,*      ,
             /codo*ya/      'many to be chapped'
     {cUb]        '(to) peel'
             /cobo*ya/       'face to peel in many places
     {cib}        'scrape with knife'
             /cibi*ya/       'to whittle'
     {ell]        'tear cloth*
             /cele*ya/       'lots of cloth to be   torn'
     {elk]        'take a salmon out from baking'
             /ceke*ya/       'to take many salmon out
                             from baking'
     The root-deriving suffix {c}, the medio-passive
indicates that the action affects the subject.          It
is commonly translated by an English transitive.
It is added directly to the root aid is obligatorily
followed by the stem formant allomorphs charac­
terizing class A.
     Examples are:
     /$an-pumca/           'to blow something away1
                           (literary form)
     /^an-pkuXca/          'to blow something away'
                           (colloquial)
     /lakca/               'to embrace'
     /mincuna/             'for a close relative to die'
     /tepca/               'to come to life'
     /tu*tuhum limcada/            'my mother is sick, she
                                  got sick on me'
     /sukuyum limcada/             'my dog got sick on me'
     /ba»s daqcada/         'the food got scorched on me'
     /tu*tuhum lipcada/            'my mother is thirsty'
     The root-deriving suffix {el} forms stative,
intransitive verbs.        It is commonly translated
'to be           It is suffixed directly to roots, but
is only followed by a stem formant when some other
inflectional or derivational suffixes are added.
     Examples are:
     {min}       'not exist'
             /minel/       'to be dead'
     {sil}       'blind'
             /silel/       'to be blind'
                                                               104      {lim}       'ail'
              /limel/      'to be sick1
      {cit}       'grip'
              /citel/      'to be tied tight'
      {cib}       'scrape or plane even and smooth
                   with a knife'
              /cibel/      'to be a long cloud in   the
                           sky (planed smooth or knife shaped).’
      Forms elicited by Dorothy D. Lee in 1930 such
as:   /9iwi»ca mi 9uwe-bele«s cipi qayumina/        'It's
 so unknown, don't travel around at night alone,
 it's dangerous I 1 and / 9iwi*ya/ 'to not know'
 seem to indicate that there is a privative morpheme
*{w} which also occurs in the negative auxiliary
/9elew/.      If this is so, then four optional positinal
 classes of root-derivation must be recognized,
 rather than one, since /9iwi*ya/ presumably consists
 of the morphemes [9i} {w} {V *y } {a}, while/9iwi*ca/
■would consist of the morphemes {9i} {w} {V •y } {c } [a],
 and /9elew/ would consist of the morphemes
 {9i} (el} {w}.     The suffixes {el}, {V*y}, and {c}
 described above as members of the same position
 class would then be members of not one but three
                                                             105separate classes.     Since it proved impossible to
re-elicit the Lee forms, these classes have not been
set up in the present description.
     The remaining inflectional and derivational
suffixes are added not to the root but to stem forms,
that is forms consisting of a radical plus one of the
stem formants.    These suffixes will therefore be
classified according to the stem form of the verb to which
they are added.     The derivational suffixes capable
of being added to stems enable the stem to be treated
as a radical, that is to be followed by another stem
formant.   Cyclical patterns of derivation previously
discussed then ensue.     This type of derivational suffix
may only be added to verb stems II and III.     Stem I may
only be followed by inflectional suffixes.
     There are two optional position classes of in­
flectional suffixes , containing in all 12 members,
which may be added to Stem I forms of verbs to mark
categories of person and evidence.     The first position
class contains 6 members, the evidential suffixes, a
suffix of approximation, and a suffix of subordination.
The evidential suffixes are at present disappearing from
colloquial use, but still survive in the oral literature.
     The evidential suffix {nthere} indicates that the
action described is reported on the basis of non-visual
sensorial perception of hearing, touch, smell, or taste,
and is commonly translated, if translated at all, as
'it feels ... to me.1    This morpheme is anomalous for
several reasons.     It is one of two morphemes in the
language ""beginning in a consonant cluster, the other
being {sken}; it is also one of two morphemes in
which this particular sequence occurs, the other
occurrence being in the form /winthu*h/ 'person'.
In addition it is one of two evidentials, the other
is {kele}, which have a number of allomorphs and
which may be followed by the personal suffixes fda}
and {sken}.
     The suffix (nthere} has four morphologically
conditioned allomorphs: /nthi/ before the first
person suffix {da} and the completive suffix {k},
/nt^ere/ before the second person suffix {sken},
/nt^er/ before the interrogative suffix {i •}, and
/nthe»/ elsewhere.     Two other suffixes and an
auxiliary verb have similarly conditioned allomorphs of
similar shapes: the passive suffix {here} which has the
shape /hi/ before the first person suffix {da}, /here/
before the second person suffix {sken}, but the shape
/heres/ elsewhere; the hearsay evidential {kele} which
has the shape /ki/ before the first person suffix
{da}, but the shape /kele/ before the second person
suffix {sken}, and the shape /ke*/ elsewhere; and the
future intentional auxiliary {wlr} which has the shape
/wi/ before the first person suffix {da}, /were/ before
the second person suffix {sken}, but /weres/ elsewhere.
Suggestive as these similarities are, their incomplete
symmetry in shape and their lack of systematic
parallelism in positions of occurrence (combinatory
possibilities), indicate that they are only to be
connected diachronically.   The non-visual sensorial
evidential is suffixed to Stem I forms of verbs and may
optionally be followed by one of five suffixes: the
first person {da}, the second person {sken}, the
dubitative {m}, the interrogative {i *} (which is added
to Stem II), and the completive '{k}.
Examples are:
/^unaTit*1ere sken/    'Thus you said (in my
                       hearing)'
/hire»nthe* qewel/     'The house is burning (feel
                       and smell it)'
/pkoj&oq kuya»-binthida/     'I have a headache,
                       I am aching as to the head
                       (i.e., I feel it.     Ob­
                       solete now)'
/hesta-bint^eri• net haras-leli/          'What do
                       you think, should I go?'
/boy ti‘n-wint^eri•/       'Are they going to
                       talk a lot?'
/pi kupanthe*/         'He is chopping wood     (I
                       hear the noise or feel
                       chips flying)'
/wirwira-kinthik/      'They came some time
                       ago (first hand knowledge)'
/ca‘wa-wint^e*m/       'They/he/she just keep on
                       singing'
/•tube‘la-bint^e•/     'It is fragrant'
     The evidential suffix [kele}, indicating that
the source of evidence is hearsay, is used largely
in the narration of myths, gossip, and the description
of the unexperienced.   It is commonly translated,
if translated at all, as 'I have heard ... to be, ...
it is said.'   This evidential has three allomorphs
similar to those of the non-visual sensorial evidential.
It has the shape /ki/ when followed by the first
person suffix [da} or the completive suffix [k}, the
shape /kele/ when followed by the second person suffix
[sken}, and the shape /ke*/ elsewhere.   While occurring
suffixed to other stem I verb forms, in the oral
literature the morpheme [kele} occurs far more
frequently suffixed to one of the two auxiliaries,
the conditional [kil} and the distant past [kirj,
forming constructions in which the sequence of
auxiliary plus evidential is postposed as a unit to
main verbs of predications.   The two sequences
/kilake*/ and /kirke*/ then frequently translate and
function simply as a past.    The suffix [kele} may be
followed by one of three
suffixes:     the first person [da], the second person
{sken}, and the dubitative {m}.       It is rarely-
followed by the personal suffixes {da} and {sken},
however, and is syntactically equally rarely used
with the first or second person subjects, possibly
because of semantic restrictions.
    Examples are;
   /kilepma* kuya-bike*/            'Frightfully sick
            you are' (I hear, you are supposed to be)
   /ca*wa-kirke*m/            'I guess they must have
            sung'
   /Xeyet-kirke•/          'I found out he got it'
    /^uni-kilake•/         'You heard about it' (re­
            mote past)
    /9uni-ke*/             'That'swhat I was told'
    /kirkida/        'I must have'
    /kirkelesken/          'You must have (come), I
            see you did it'
    /kirke*/        'a third person must have
            come/gotten'
    /pi iupake*/           'Heis chopping wood, I hear'
                                                             Ill
       The evidential suffix {re*}, the inferential,
indicates that the information being given is
inferred from logic applied to circumstantial sensory
evidence, or evidence of natural necessity.          It is
commonly translated, if translated at all, as 'it must
be.'    The evidential {re*}, unlike the evidentials
{nthere} and {kele}, may be followed by only a single
optional suffix, the dubitative {m}.
       Examples are:
       /sukere*/       'must be there (standing )'
       /biyare*/       'must be there (lying)'
       /wirare*/       'must have come'
       /hara*re/       'must have gone'
       /suke-bire*/    'I guess they are (standing)’
       /biya-bire*/    'I guess they are (lying)'
       /wira-bire*/    'They must be coming'
       /hara*-bire•/ 'They must be going'
       /nicay hara*re* nor/      'My nephew is gone south'
            (I infer from seeing specific traces)
       /pi kupare*/    'He's chopping wood' (he and his
            axe are gone from the cabin, so I infer it)
       /biyare*m/       'This must be the one (lying), I
            guess’
    The evidential suffix f^el}, the experiential,
                                                 I
indicates that the information being given is
deduced from experience and involves the exercise
of judgement.   It is commonly translated, if
translated at all, as 'I think it to he so'.
The inferential evidential differs from the other
evidentials in that it is never followed by
further suffixation.
    Examples are;
   /buha^el/         'I guess they're sitting home'
   /pi kupa^el/      'He is chopping wood (He has a
         job cutting wood, he usually goes
         everyday between 8 and 5, it is 3
         o'clock, and yesterday at 3 o'clock he
         was chopping wood)'
    /cala* biya^el/      'I guess that may be good
         (it was good last tine)'
    /ho*n hina-kila^el/      'They should have
         arrived by now'
    /pite bira^el/      'My father-in-law must be
         hungry (because I know he's alone and
         bedridden)1
    The inflectional subordinating suffix {r}
indicates that the verb so suffixed is syntacti­
cally dependent and semantically anterior in
regard to causality or time.       It is commonly
                                    i
translated 'because of, of             It is optionally
followed by one of two morphemes;       the subordi­
nating suffix of temporal anteriority {^a}, or
the subordinating suffix of unexpected
simultaneity [ W } ,      The reflexive possessive
pronominal suffix [rj is most certainly historically
related.
    Examples are;
    /ba*r/       'because of eating ...'
    /nis ba*-be*sum winer hara* ^isuk/          'They
           left because they saw me eating'
    /^iwi^yar nis ^ele'le's mis qayupaqmina/
           •Because it is so unknown I can't come
           to see you'
    /^el-tununa’r^a/          'After having put it
           away then ...'
    /buhar^an/         'while sitting, while remaining,
           staying ...'
    The inflectional suffix of approximation
{puke*} indicates unrealized states and frequently
translates ’almost.'       This suffix is probably
historically derived from the independent verb
stem /puke*/ 'to be not quite done (cooked), raw,
or partly raw.'      It is optionally followed by
the suffix {da}.
    Examples are;
    /$icuna*puke*da/          'I almost cut my finger'
   /hara•puke•da/           'I came near going, I
            almost went'
   /qoti*sapuke*-be*sken/           'I see you look as
            if you would prove to be strong' (literal­
            ly:   strong-like you are I see)
   The second and final position class of inflec­
tional suffixes which are optionally added to
stem I forms of verbs contains six members; the
personal suffixes, the dubitative suffix, the suffix
of past repetition, and two subordinating suffixes.
Not all six of these co-occur with all the members
of the first position class of inflectional
suffixes.
     The inflectional suffix [da], the personal suffix
of selfness, always translates as first person subject.
Apparently, before the two morphemes *{s} and *{kenj
coalesced into the second person inflectional suffix
{sken}, the suffix {da} distinguished self from non-self.
Just as the second person morpheme appears to have,
developed from a nominal suffix of concession or
emphasis following a nominalizing suffix, the first
person morpheme may historically be ultimately related
to the substantival emphatic and intensifying suffix
{da}, as occurring in the form /hida/ 'very.'
     Although itself without allomorphs, the suffix
{da} frequently conditions two types of allomorphs if
the preceding morpheme is one of five auxiliaries
or three suffixes.   One type involves contraction of
a two consonant cluster, and the second type a
syncopation with or without compensatory vowel
lengthening or vowel ablaut.   These alternations are
discussed under each of the following affected
auxiliaries and suffixes:      {suk}, {wlr}, {kUy},
{bUh}, {bly}, {here}, {nthere}, and {kele}.
    Examples are;
   /hara*da/        'I   am walking'
   /muteda/     'I hear'
   /wineda/     'I see'
   /hure *?ibi*da/         'I am sewing'
   /pele harle ba*da/          'We'll all go'
    /'
   /ca»wa        /
          ^ise'da/          'I sang recently'
   /ca*wa-kirkida/          'I guess I sang'
   /ca*wada/        'I'm singing, I just finished
         singing'
   /ca*wa-binthida/          'I guess I'm singing'
   /ni haras-kuda/          'I want to go'
   /Xeyhida/        'I   just got hit'
   /hari*l-wida/          'I'm about to take them'
   /hara•puke•da/          'I came near going, I
         almost went'
                                                             117
     The inflectional suffix {sken], the second person
subject suffix, is commonly translated as ""you.""
Non-canonical in phonemic shape (only one other suffix,
{nthere}, begins in a consonant cluster) it seems to re­
semble the combination of two morphemes, the generic
aspect {sj, and either the substantive suffix {ken}
which emphasixes an individual at the expense of all
other individuals which might have been referred to
or included in the expectation, or the post posed
optative root {ken} which expresses doubt and translates
often as ""maybe.""   Both of the latter morphemes with the
shape /ken/ may ultimately be related historically,
and semantically are possible candidates for second person
final inflectional suffixes, being semantically paralleled
by a suffix of very high frequency on third person forms,
the dubitative {m}, which marks a concession to the
personal subject when reporting his behavior and indi­
cates less certainty than when reporting the behavior
of the first person.   Moreover, another suffix, {ken},
the warning imperative suffix often translated ""lest"", and
used with Stem II, has the allomorph /ken/ only with
2nd persons.
     The sequence /sken/ patterns, however, like a
single morpheme unrelated to the sequence {sj {ken} in
                                                           118
terras either of possibilities of occurrence or of
position class membership.   Thus the form [sken] is
suffixed only to five auxiliaries and three suffixes:
the passive {here}, the hearsay evidential {kele},
the non-visual snesorial evidential {nthere}, while
the generic aspect suffix {s} is suffixed to the
Stem III form of all verbs, but never to the two
suffixes {kelej and {nthere}.    In addition, these
suffixes are never followed by stem formants,,
while the {s } suffix is always suffixed to a stem
formant, the stem formant {i}.   The analysis of
/sken/ as a single morpheme is further supported by
its apparent membership in a single position class.
That is, there are only two position classes of inflection­
al suffixes which are added to Stem I forms of verbs.
The evidentials with which the sequence of /sken/ occurs
are members of the first position class.   '.Vith the
exception of the sequence /sken/ thay may only be
followed by a single morpheme.   If the sequence /sken/
is analyzed as two morphemes, a third position class
would have to be recognized, which would consist of only
one member, a member capable of co-occurring with but
a single member of the preceding position class.
     Patterns of syntactic agreement also support the
analysis of the sequence /sken/ as a single morpheme.
                                                              119That is, verb forms terminating with /sken/ may only
co-oocnr syntactically with second person pronominal
forms, just as vehb forms terminating with {da} 'first
person' may only co-occur with first person pronominal
forms.     Most probably,   {sken} is historically two
morphemes, but has just become synchronically analyzable
as one.
      The suffix {sken} may only be suffixed to the
morphemes {here}, {nt^ere}, and {kele}, as well as
to the first stem of the auxiliary verbs {wlr}, {bly},
{9iy}, and {suk}, and may not be followed by further
suffixation.     Main verbs not inflected for one of the
categories marked by the suffixes {here}, {nthere},
{kele}, may only be marked for second person syntactically,
by postposing or juxtaposing an auxiliary verb form
inflected for second person.
     The inflectional suffix {m}, the dubitative,
expresses doubt or question.*      It seems to be function­
ally and semantically equivalent to the interrogative
intonation when added to declarative statements in
English.     It has two common translations:   a
declarative statement of some slight doubt, or a weak
*   These two functions are formally distinguished with
    two aspectual attributive auxiliaries {bly} and
    {bUh}; see under section 2.2.
interrogative.   When suffixed to forms to which the
second person suffix {sken} may also he suffixed, it
generally translates as a third person declarative of
some doubtfulness.     When suffixed to forms to which the
second person suffix {sken} is never affixed, it gener­
ally translates as a second person interrogative,
although it may also be translated as a third person
declarative of mild doubt.     Syntactic co-occurrence
with personal pronouns specifies not only number,
but the choice between interrogation and a declaration
of doubt.   There seems to be a tendency, perhaps due to
the pressure of English bilingualism to use the
dubitative {mj suffix to indicate almost paradigmatic
contrast with the first and second person suffixes (da}
and {sken}, which are conveniently members of the
same position class.    Thus, informants generally
translate English paradigms ""i/we          ""you ...,""
""he/she/they ..."" by / ....da/, / ....sken/, and
/ ,...m/ respectively, although in a more normal
situation {ra} clearly implies primarily an element of
uncertainty, not person.     In view of the internal
structural and external functional pressures, were the
language to survive in use, the verb might well become
inflected for three persons, with {m} marking the third
person.
     The dubitative suffix {mj is added directly to
the stem or to the evidential suffixes {nthere},
{kele], and {re*}.   It is never followed by further
suffixation.
     Examples are;
     /ca*wam ini/    'fid you sing, are you singing?'
     / ca •warn/     'fid you sing, are you singing?'
     /ca*wa wiram/   'Are you going to sing?'
     J f
    /Ca*wa-ba*m mi/'fo you sometimes sing?'
   /ca«wa *?ibe*m/       'They are singing (doubtfully)1
   /ca*wa kilake*m/      'I guess they sang long ago (I
         heard about it)1
   /ca*wa kenehale-bo*m/         'They might sing (I
         guess)'
    /ca*wa ^ele»m/         'Someone (they) sang just
         now (doubtfully), You sang?1
    The inflectional suffix [k}, the completive,
indicates that the action is, was, or will be
performed or finished.     When combined with the
auxiliaries of aspect, appropriate extensions in
meaning ensue.     For example, the combination
of the durative auxiliary {bUh} with the com­
pletive indicates that an action is performed
completely during an extent of time and by
extension repeatedly, generally, or always.       It
is therefore most frequently translated as 'always,
repeatedly, as a rule, generally, etc.,' or not
translated at all.     The completive suffix has two
phonologically conditioned variants:     /ik/ after
consonants, and /k/ after vowels.     It is suffixed
only to five auxiliaries:     {bly}, {bUh}, {wlr},
                                                              123   1[kilj, {su}, and to the evidential [nthere|.     It is
suffixed to the stein I form of these auxiliaries, hut
in one example it appears to he suffixed not to the
auxiliary alone, hut to the whole construction in
which the auxiliary participates, consisting of a main
verh, stem I in form, followed hy a stem III for the
auxiliary {hly}.
     Examples are;
     /Ao*ma ^ikilak/      'I myself saw them kill it'
     /ha* ^ikilak/        *(T ) ate it (distant past)'
     /^uni ni ^iye-ha'k/ 'That's the way I do it (always)'
     /ca*wa-be/sik/       'You saw them sing a while ago,
          you know thay can/do sing'
     /ca*wa-ba*k ni/      'I sing   all the time, sometimes
          I sing, I sing once in a while'
     /caluma*-suk/        'Always be good!'
     /pi ca*wit biyak/    'I'm sure he does sing (I've
          seen him)'
     /ca*wit biyak/       'You sing, I've seen you'
    / ca*wa-be•sinthik/   'I heard them singing some time ago'
    /ne*l ^elew ha*l/     'We two   do not, no we don't'
    /ne*let yica* ^isuk/'They named the two of us'
     The subordinating inflectional suffix ('?aj,
indicates temporal anteriority, and that the verb so
suffixed is syntactically dependent.    It is commonly
                                                            124
translated as 'then         after having        It is
suffixed directly to the stem, or after the subordinating
inflectional suffix indicating causal anteriority, {r }.
     Examples are:
     /pat-hokelta^a hara*/       'After he jumped out he
          went away,    he jumped out andwent   away'
    /ba*9a/      'while    eating ...'
    /bo*sta9a/   'All of a sudden
    /9uni9a/     'And then ...'
    /9el-tununa*9a/        'After they put it away,
          then .. .'
     /9el-tununa*r9a/      'After having put it away,
          then ...'
   The subordinating inflectional suffix {tan}
indicates unexpected or contradictory simul­
taneity of actions or states.    It is commonly
translated as 'while ..., in spite of ...,
anyhow ..., anyway ..., although ...'     It is
suffixed only to auxiliaries , or following
the subordinating inflectional suffix indicating
causal anteriority,   {r}, and the passive {here}.
    Examples are;
   /ca‘wa-we^an/       'anyway, I'll still sing'
   /^elew-be*tan wine hara* wira ^ibi^da/
         'Even if there's nothing to it, I'm going

     In terms of suffixational potential, the stem
II form of verbs is by far the most coraplex of the
stem forms, both in number of position classes and in
number of'suffixes affixed.   Four position classes of
stem-deriving derivational suffixes, comprising in all
seven morphemes, and three position classes of
inflectional suffixes, comprising a total of thirteen
morphemes, are optionally affixed to stem II to mark
modal categories.   Although no class is of
obligatory occurrence, the occurrence of one member
of both the second and third position classes of
inflectional suffixes is contingent on the occurrence
of a member of the preceding class of inflectional
suffixes.   Each of the four optional position classes
of stem-deriving suffixes is obligatorily followed by
a stem formant which must be {u} if further stem II
suffixation follows.
     The first position class of stem-deriving
derivational suffixes contains three members which
specify the aspect of the overtly or covertly expressed
syntactic subject or object of the verb.
     The stein-deriving derivational suffix {t },
which is not translated, marks the verb as
having a syntactic subject of particular aspect,
whether overtly expressed or not.        This suffix
has two morphologically conditioned allomorphs:
/•t/ if suffixed to a verb of class B, C, D, K,
or L, which have long vowel allomorphs of the
stem formant {a}, and ft/ elsewhere.         It forms
verbs which are members of conjugation class J.
    In a few instances stems derived for par­
ticular subject with this suffix are homphonous
with stems inflected for subordination with the
suffix {ta}:    for example, the form /ba*ta/ means
both ’while eating,' and 'to be meaty of nuts/
acorns.'
    Examples are   •
                   •    /ba* ta/       'to be meaty of nuts'
    /ba*tar/       'because of being meaty'
    /yaleqta/      'to drop something'
    /yaleqtu/      'drop it'
    /huyu*ta/      'reading, to read'
    /hulu•ta/      'to bunch together (of people)'
    /hokelta/      'to jump'
    /boloqtuma•/       'to do gently or softly'
           (/boloq/       'soft, fragile')
    The transitivizing stem-deriving derivational
suffix {i •1} indicates that the verb has a
syntactic object in the particular aspect, which
may or may not be overtly expressed.       It is
frequently translated 'together' or 'with.1        It
has two phonologically conditioned variants:
/wil/ after vowels, and /i*l/ after consonants.
It forms verbs that are members of conjugation
class P.
    Examples are:
    /ca*wuwil/        'Sing with themI'
    /weri*l/          'to bring someone'
    /wacuwil/         'to cry with someone (in sympathy)'
    /noyi*l/          'to laugh with someone'
    /suki*l/          'to own or have'     (lit: to be
           standing with particular ones)
    /^ol-hika^yuwil/      'to stand up with someone'
    /cupi*l/          'to wade with someone'
    /bohi*lpure/      'living together'
    /xun-pile*wil/ 'all bound up/
    /put tupuwilda/      'I weeded (the garden) with
           him/her'
    /^ole'lbe'm qewel hari*lenso/         'I'd like to
           take them to church'
    The transitivizing stem-deriving derivational
suffix [m} indicates that the verb has a syntactic
object in the generic aspect, which may or may
not be overtly expressed.    The action of another
verb may be interpreted as a generic object.
It is frequently translated 'with' or 'while
doing something else.'     It forms verbs that are
members of class M.
    Example s are;
    /qerumena*/       'to suffer'
    /werma/           'to come bringing' (i.e. with
         something'
    /qayuma/          'to carry things with one, to
         peddle'
    /ca*wuma/         to sing along while doing
         something else'
    /^olumena*/       'to bandage oneself'
    /do cuma/         'to roast meat'
    /dukama/          'to put things away
    /haya•ruma/       'to go round fast'
    /keruma/          'to finish'
    /kerumeta/        'after having finished'
    The second position class of optional stem-
deriving suffixes contains a single member, the
reflexive {n}, which indicates that the conse­
quences of the verbal action revert to, affect,
involve, or are for the sake of the subject.
It is commonly translated, if translated at all,
by the English reflexive pronouns, or, rarely in
idiomatic fashion, by a form referring to a
specific extension of the subject such as clothing.
It forms verbs which are members of conjugation
class K.
    Examples are:
    /mutna*/         'to feel oneself'
   /$aqcuna«da/      'I'm hitting myself'
    /yoquna*/        'to wash any part of one's   body'
   /yoquna/          'Wash yourself1'
    /yoqunapure/     'Let's wash each other'
    /doyuna*/        'to be tame' (of animals),       lit;
           to give themselves
    /doyunama*/       'to tame,' lit:    to make to
           give themselves
   /cinuna*-wen/     'Shall I help myself, I
           intend to help myself

          'to wrap oneself with generic materials'

     /9el-tununa*r9a/'After having put them away, then...
     /se-dokcuna•/       'They put it here and there inside
          their clothes,' lit: 'on two sides-stick away
          objects-benefitting the subject-for the sake
          of the subject's specific extension, i.e.,
          clothes'
     /tisa*na»s/        'an umbrella,' lit: 'that which
          is shady to oneself
     The third position class of optional stem-
deriving suffixes also contains a single member, the
causative suffix {m} which frequently translates as 'make
or as an adverbial showing involvement, participation,
or manipulation.     The causative suffix forms verbs of
conjugation class M.
     Examples are:
     /ba*ma*/         'to feed,' lit: 'to cause to eat'
    /ba*ma*s-koyit/        '(a) hospitable (person)'
                                                               134

/mayuma*s/       'the teacher,' lit: 'the one who
     causes (them) to follow'
/mayume/       'You teach them!'
             The fourth and last position class of stern-
deriving suffixes contains two members, the reciprocal
and the personal transitivizer.
     The stem-deriving derivational suffix {pur},
the reciprocal, also occurs on pronouns.       It indicates
that the action takes place between the plural subjects
who participate mutually, reciprocally and distributively
in the action.   It is a unique subclass of the conjugation
class H, having the stem forms /pure/ for stem I,
/pur/ for stem II, and /puri/ for stem III.
     Examples are:
    /manapure/        'to have war'
    /bohi*lpure/      'to live together'
    / 9elew-be*m Aikupurmina/         'peace,' lit:
          'no fighting each other now'
    /Aikupule/        'Let's all fight (each other)'
    /yalupure/        'to separate'
    /me’in nite*ruin leweqapure ^ise^da/        'We talked
          about the water'
    /‘Mepelwilpure/        'Everybody is happy'
    /cinupure/             'to commit adultery'
    /cinupuri/             'having committed adultery1
                                                             136    /yoqunapure/          'to wash each other'
    /xun-topupure/        'to he all joined together'
    /qomihpure/           'to agree, conclude'
     The stem-deriving derivational suffix {paq},
the personal transitivizer, indicates that the verb
syntactically has a personal object which may or may
not be overtly expressed.     It forms verbs which are
members of conjugation class F, but which are somewhat
defective, occu ring in this corpus only followed by
three inflectional suffixes: the personal object suffix
{-1 j, the first person subject suffix {daj, and the
nominalizing suffix (s|.
     Examples are;
    /ini litiqpaqat/       'You fix it for me!'
     /^elewpaq/            'missing something'
     /puba*tpurum ^ihpaq/        'Do it for them!'
     /mi ^ihpaqat/         'You do it for me!'
     /ba's-^ilay mis werepaqda/         'I brought you
         a little food'
     /ti*npaq ^ise^da silelesum/        'I talked
          (interpreted) for the blind one'
     /9i\epaqas/        'something all decorated, trimmed,
          ornamented'
     /hika»yupaqheres/        'the one(s) who stood
          by him/her/them'

     The first optional position class of inflectional
suffixes contains two members: the passive suffix, and
the suffix of warning.   The passive suffix is somewhat
anomalous in that it is the only stem II inflectional
suffix which may be followed by stem I inflectional
suffixes.
     The inflectional suffix [ken} indicating warning
in the sense of English 'lest', is commonly trans­
lated 'be careful ... might happen.'   It resembles two
morphemes of identical shape: the substantive suffix
(ken} which emphasizes an individual at the expense of
all other individuals who might have been referred to
or included in the expectation, and the postposed
optative root {ken} which translates as 'maybe.'
The differences in function and distribution make it
impossible to synchronically identify this suffix with
the two aforementioned morphemes or with the second
person suffix (sken}, although the limitations on the
co-occurrence of {ken} with other stem II inflectional
suffixes mark it as anomalous and point to a common
historical origin for these three morphemes.
     The warning suffix has two morphologically
conditioned allomorphs; it has the shape /ke/ when
followed by the hortative [di], and it has the shape
/ken/ elsewhere.     It may only be followed   by the
suffix {di}.
     Examples are:
     /baXken/        'Be careful you might menstruate I'
     /tukuken/       'You might get drowned, watch out!'
     /balaken/       'Don't tell a lie!'
     /piya ^ihkedi/       'He might do it himself,
            don't let him do it! (do it yourself)'
     /pode*li koyuken/         'Don't try to get hurt!’
     /pode»luken/        'Look out you might get hurt!'
     The inflectional suffix {here}, the passive,
is anomalous for several reasons.     Unlike any other
inflectional suffixes affixed to stem II forms of
verbs, it may be followed by two stem I inflectional
suffixes:   {da} and {dken}, and one stem III
inflectional suffix,    {s}.   In addition it differs
from the other inflectional suffixes affixed to
stem II in number and type of allomorphs, which
allomorphy more closely resembles in both number and
type that of auxiliary verbs and the non-visual
sensorial evidential {nthere}.
     The passive has two phonologically conditioned
variants flhlfl s /hi/ and /he/ which alternate
morphologically with /here/.     Preceding the second
person subject suffix {sken} and the noininalizing suffix
{s }, the passive has the shape /here/; elsewhere it
has the shape IhlJ.
     The passive is followed by five suffixesj the
first person subject {da}, the second person subject
{sken}, the generic aspect suffix {s}, the inevitable
future {le}, the hortative [di}.
     Examples are;
     /Xeyhida/        'I just got hit1
     /Xeyheresken/    'You just got hit'
     /Xeyheres/       'the   one who got hit, he who got
          hit'
     /doyuheres/      'the   one it was given to'
     /harma*heres/    'the one who was made   to go'
     /hari*lheres/    'the one who was taken along'
     /hari*lheresken/        'I see you are being taken
          along'
     /hari*lhida/     'I am/was being taken along'
     /doyuheresken/ 'It is being given to you'
     /doyuhida/       'It is being given to m e 1
     /^el-^iheres/    'things that have been stored'
                                                             140
    /pur winhele-ba*da hima*/       'I will be seen by
         him tomorrow1
    /wirnayun po * kacuhedi/     'May he now be chewed
         up by the grizzly bear (literary curse)'
    /harhele*s/        'so that they could go' lit:
         'so that they could be taken'
    /boyun winhida./    'I am being seen by a lot of them'i
       The second optional position class of Inflectional
suffixes affixed to the stem II form of verbs contains
four members, two of which indicate anticipation or
expectation of a verbal action as yet uninitiated.
       The inflectional suffix {le}, the inevitable future,
indicates natural and inevitable necessity, futurity,
causality, potentiality, and probability which might/
can/must be later in the sequence of events.     In contrast
to the auxiliary verb {wlr}, the future intentional,
which often has the same translation, the inevitable
future {le} does not describe an intentional or volitional
act.    It is commonly translated as the future, or
'before         'so as to,' or 'about to.'   Unless a
pronoun accompanies it syntactically, {le} is generally
translated as third person and is never translated as
second.    If the person is to be specified morphologically
it is necessary to add a postposed auxiliary inflected
for person.   Historically, the morpheme {le} seems to
be the reduced form of a verb root {111}, meaning 'to
mak«i to become, to become perforce, to manufacture,
to be arranged, placed, or transformed.'     The morpheme
{le} has two morphologically conditioned allomorphs;
it has the shape /le*/ before the generic aspect suffix
{s }, and the shape /le/ elsewhere.   The morpheme {le} is
followed only ""by the stem II inflectional morpheme
{so}, and stem III inflectional morpheme [sj.
     Examples are:
    /harle/   /hale/ (allegro)        'Let's go, let's
          all go'
    /ba*le*s ni/        'I will/might/could/should/
          would/ought to eat'
    /ca*wa-hale•s/        'they could go there to sing;
          they could go along singing; they could go
          and sing'
     /pite*rum harle-bo*m/         'all of them will go'
    /mite'rum harle-bo•sken/          'You will all go*
     /pele harle-ba*da/        'We'll all go'
    /Xikupule/        'Let's all fight each other'
     /xi»naleso/      'before they went to sleep'
     /ca»wuleso/      'before singing'
    /har-walele, be *le--ba*da./         'Go you two, I
          must/will stay,'
    /xonle-bo*m ba*leso./        'He shall get dry before
          he eats.'
   /tintinpure buha-kilake* xi*naleso./       'They
        sat talking before they went to bed'
         (They went to bed by force of custom;
        talking beforehand was a matter of
        momentary preference)
   /Xitiqle/       'Let's all fix it, it's, going
        to be made'
   /^itiqhele/     'so that they'll make it'
   /po*m honda behe^an ni wele*s./      'Even if
        it took many years, I would come'
    The subordinating inflectional suffix {n}
indicates temporal simultaneity, especially of
as yet unrealized or potential action, and that the
verb so suffixed is syntactically dependent.       It
commonly translates as 'while,' but is untrans­
lated when appearing with the morpheme {s6}.
When this morpheme follows a stem II form which
has been derived by the causative suffix {m}, it
most often translates in the second person, and
the sequence /men/ ({m}{u}{n}) has the same
force for the second person that {le} has for
first and third persons.   It has three morpho­
logically conditioned allomorphs.    'When suffixed
to verbs of conjugation classes B, C, D, K, and
L, which have a long vowel allomorph of the
stem formant {a}, the morpheme {n} has the shape
/•n/; when suffixed to a member of conjugation
class E it has the shape /un/; and elsewhere it
has the shape /n/.    It may only be followed by
the subordinating suffix {so}.
    Examples are:
    /doyu*n/         'while going'
    /were*n/         'while bringing'
    /werun/          'while coming'
   /harmen/          'before going, while     going .
   /harmenso/        'before I go, before     going .
   /ca*wumen/        'while singing
   /ba*men ca*wu/     'sing while you're eating'.'
   /ba*menso cu*s kop/      'Before eating, chop
        me some wood!'
   /we^e war se-josuna’men/          'Come to seek
        good luck!'
   /ken-wanu tepumen/        'Open your mouth wide
        so that you can get across!'
   /harmenso me-m doyu*t/        'Give me a drink
        of water before you go!'
                                                                145     /wayken harmenso, yelwinit/          'Before you go
             over the brow of the hill, look hack at me I'
     /hulmen hoy ha/        'Eat much so as to get fat I'
     /hima* harinen pomin-pana/          'Before you leave
             tomorrow morning, go to bed.'     (Go to bed
             since you must leave )
     The inflectional suffix {n}, the first person jussive,
commonly translates as 'I'll          let me        I'd
like to .... '    It has two phonologically conditioned
variants:     *?*n/ following vowels, and /en/ following
consonants, which alternate; morphologically with /n/
following the two verbs, the future intentional suxiliary
fwlr}, and the verb 'to go,'    {har}.    The first person
jussive may only be followed by {so}.
     Examples are:
     /han/        'I'm going to go, let me go'
     /wen/        'I'll come, shall I come'
     /ni mikis han/       'I'll go first'
     /hari*lenso/         'Let me take ..., I'd     like to
             take'
     /ca*wu-wen/        'I'm going to sing'
     /Aitiqna*nso/      'I'll make it for myself'
     The inflectionalsuffix {di}, the       hortative,     is
commonly translated as 'may it happen, would        that it
happen.'     The hortative is suffixed directly to the root
                                                                  146
or following a member of the first position class of
inflectional suffixes.     When the hortative is suffixed
to the auxiliary {bly}, the resulting form /be’di/ functions
as a negative preverb.     This form possibly consists
of the morpheme {bly}, the auxiliary root, plus ^w,
the privative, and {di}, the hortative, with the same
inorphophoneinic consonant loss and compensatory
lengthening often occurring with the negative preverb
/9elew/.
     Examples are:
     /hardi/      'let him go'
     /ca*wudi/    'may he sing'
     /witi*l sanihadi po*/          'Ivlay it soon be daylight'
     /9ewin be*di po*/           'Would that he were here'
     / 9ole*las p o • ni bedi/        'Would that I were tali'
     /piya 9ihkedi/      'He might do it himself, don't
           let him do it (do it yourself)'
  /‘q^rudi-bo./         'Let him pound him1
  /be*di hu*mus war ba»mina/         'Don't eat
         any fat'
  /pite*rum ca*wudi/         'Let them sing'
  /pi ca*wudi/         'Let him/her sing'
  /wimayun po• kacuhedi/         'May he he now
         chewed up by the grizzly bear!'
   The third and final optional position class of
inflectional suffixes affixed to stem II forms
of verbs contains seven members which indicate
negation, exhortation, interrogation, subor­
dination, and the presence of a personal object.
None of these morphemes are ever followed by
further suffixation.
    The inflectional suffix {mina}, the negative,
is commonly translated as 'not.'     Although the
final vowel /a/ is no longer synchronically
segmentable, this suffix is evidently related to
a verb root {min} 'to not exist,' from which is
derived the stative form/ninel/ 'to be dead'.
While itself a bound morpheme,    [mina} is syntac­
tically almost always in unilateral dependence
on one of two preverbs:     the negative /^elew/,
or the prohibitive /be»di/.     These two preverbs
always occupy the first syntactic position in the
verb string while {mina} is always the final ^
morpheme affixed to the last member of the verb
string, the verb whose meaning it negates.
The suffix {mina} may also be suffixed to the
negative preverb itself to form /*?elewmina/
'certainly,' i.e., 'don't demur, don't (say)
no, don't notl'     The negative is always suffixed
directly to stem II forms of verbs.
    Examples are:•
    /*?elewda harmina/       'I didn't go'
    /9elew-be*sken harmina/          'You didn't go'
    /^elew-be’m harmina/         'He didn't go'
    /9elewar xi*namina/         'not enough sleep'
    /9elew-be»sken haras-lelit be*mina/           'I
         see you're not able to go'
    / 9elewda ca*wi-koyumina/        'I don't want
         to sing'
    /9elewam ca*wi-koyumina/         'Don't you want
         to sing?'
    /bohmina/        'Don't stayI'

        9        /
                       'not gambling, I'm not
     playing cards, I never gamble, no one

     cified )'
/*?elew-be» cuhmina/       'He/she/they are not
     playing cards'
/^elewda harmina/        'I'm not going'

     want to go'
/^elew luhemina/        'It doesn't/didn't/     isn't rain(ing)'
/^elewbe^m Aikupurmina/        'peace' (no one
     fighting each other now)
/niyo *?elew-bak hayhaynamina/       'I_ don't
     like that very well'
    /*?elewam harmina/            'You didn't go?'
    /be*di hu*mus war-ba*mina/             'Don't eat
         any fat1'
    The inflectional suffix          (e •}, the first
person dual hortative, is commonly translated as
'Let's you and j&e..., Let's va two                  It
                    f ' ‘
has two phonologically conditioned variants:
/we*/ following     vowels, and /e*/         following
consonants.    It is suffixed directly to the stem,
and never follows any of the other classes of
inflectional suffixes.         This morpheme may be
historically related in form to the root {wlr}
'to come,' whose imperative has the variant
shape /we*?e/, of which /we*/ could be a contrac­
tion.   In meaning it seems to be related to the
future intentional auxiliary {wlr}.
    Examples are;
    /ba«we*/        'Let's u m two eat'
    /9uhe*/         'Let's you and I        do it'
    /hare*/         'Let's you and I        go'
    /yaqunawe-/             'Let's wash our two selves'
    The subordinating inflectional suffix (so}
indicates necessary temporal anteriority, and
                                                        151
that the verb so suffixed is syntactically
dependent.     It is commonly translated as 'before.1
It is never suffixed directly to the stem form,
                                 L
but is always preceded by a member of the second
position class of inflectional suffixes.
    Examples are:
    /litiqna*nso/       'I'll make it for myself'
   /ca*wu-wenso/        'I'm going to sing, I want
         to sing'
    /wenso/        'I'll come'
    /haleso/        'just before going, just before
         one goes'
    /po»qta 9ila*m hari*lenso/           'Let me take

    /harmenso/        'before going'
    /si*wi hayuwen harmenso/           'I'm going to
         read a little before I go'
    / 9ole*lbe*m qewel hari*lenso/          'I'd like
         to take them to church'
    /xi*naleso/        'before   they went to sleep'
    /ca»wuleso/        'before singing'
    /wayken harmenso yelwinit/           'Before you
         go over the brow of the hill look back
         at me'
     /xonle-bo* ba*leso/        ’He shall get dry,
          heing (perforce) about to ieat,' i.e.,
          he shall get dry before he eats.
     /tintinpure buha-kilake« xi»naleso/       'They

     The inflectional suffix {± •}, the impersonal inter­
rogative, questions the predication.     If the utterance
is not syntactically marked as to person, the
interrogative translates as third person; if the
utterance is syntactically marked it may translate any
person.   It has two phologically conditioned variants:
/wi*/ following vowels, and /i*/ following consonants.
The interrogative is suffixed only to auxiliaries and
evidentials.
     Examples are;
     /^el-wira ^ibewi* ni harmina/        'Am I not going
          to go?1
     /nuya ^ibewi*/        'Is he laughing?1
    /peh *?isto* ti*n *?isuki*/       'What did that
          person say?'
    /suke-bewi*/         'Is he standing there, do you
          see him?'
                                                               153
    /weri-/         'Is he/are they coming?'
    /waca»ntheri*/         'Did she cry, did you hear
          her?'
    /hestit ^iye-bewi*/         'What sort of person is

    /heker 9iye ^ibewi*/         'Whose is that?'

     /hesta kint^eri* net harasleli/           'How did

     /hesta bint^eri* net haras-leli/           'What do you
          think, should I go?'
     /boy ti*n wint^eri•/        'Are they going to talk
          a lot?'
     The inflectional suffix {u*j, the first person
interrogative, questions the predication and always
translates as a first person interrogative.        The co­
occurrence of pronouns with this morpheme, as elsewhere
with morphemes marking person, syntactically specifies
number.   The first person interrogative has two phono-
logically conditioned variants: /wu*/ following vowels
and /u*/ following consonants.
       Examples are:
       /weru*/       'Shall I come?'
       /heke•n-'bo*m weri«lu* phaqam./      'From where
            shall we bring the manzanita wood?'
       /tepumewu*/       'Shall I cross with it?'
       /9ut pe*l henuwu*/       '.That shall we two do?'
       The subordinating inflectional suffix [ta]
indicates temporal anteriority or simultaneity which
is conditioned, dependent, or resultant, and that the
verb so suffixed is syntactically dependent.        It is
commonly translated as 'while, during, after, when,
as.'    It has two phonologically conditioned variants:
flvtajj after stems ending in a consonant, such as
/silel/ 'to be blind,' and /ta/ after all other stems.
       Examples are:
       /mineleta haleba*da/       'I'll go .just as he's
            dying'
    /ba-ta/          'while eating' (homonymous with
            derived verb stem ba*ta 'to be meaty, of
            nuts')
       /ca*wuta haleba*da/       'I'll go when they
            start singing'
       /ca*wa kerumeta haleba*da/       'I'll go when
they finish singing'
       The inflectional suffix {*t} indicates that
there is a personal object of the verb stem
action.     When the verb form does not co-occur
syntactically with a pronoun or noun object,
{•t} commonly translates 'for me, to me;' when
there is a pronoun object, the translation of
{•t} will agree with it in person.       It has two
phonologically conditioned variants:       /t/
following vowels, and Ivtl following consonants,
which alternate morphologically with the shape
/•t/ when {«t] is suffixed to members of
conjugation classes B, C, D, K, and 1 which
have long vowel allomorphs of the stem formant
{a}.     The personal object suffix is affixed
directly to the stem or following the transi-
tivizer {paq}.

     Only the substantival inflectional suffixes
of aspect are affixed to stern III forms of verbs.
There is, however, a single optional position class of
stem-deriving derivational suffixes which may be
affixed to stem II.   These derivational suffixes are
identical in phonemic shape and related in meaning to
allomorphs of the substantival aspect suffixes, but
are marked as being synchronically separate morphemes
by their distribution and their own allomorphy.      This
optional position class of stem-deriving derivational
suffixes is obligatorily followed by a stem formant,
and contains two members which form stative, intransi­
tive trerbs.
     The stem-deriving derivational suffix {h} derives
stative, intransitive verbs from stem III forms of
verbs of primarily nominal function.   In one instance
it also derives a verb from a pronominal root.     It is
commonly translated as 'to be ..., to be like ...'
     Examples are*
     /sani/     'today'
     /saniha/   'to be daylight/daytime'
     /pu/       'that'
     /puha/     'to be yonder'
   /sede/      'coyote'
   /sedeha/       'to be like Coyote (promiscuous,
         flirtatious)'
   /sede*/      'glide'
   /sede*ha/      'to be gliding, sailing,
         flying, floating'
   /ceri/      'sand'
   /ceriha/       'to be sandy'
   /iuli/       'penis'
   /ituliha/      'to be slim, thin'
   /ca*wi/      'a song'
   /ca*wiha/       'to be like a song'
   /teXi/       'belly'
   /teXiha/       'to be pregnant'
   /wi*ta/       'man'
   /wi*taha/       'to mature'
   /coki/      'near'
   /cokiha/       'to approach'
   /canal/      'moon'
   /canaXa/       'to be moon-light'
   The stem-deriving derivational suffix {s]y
derives stative intransitive verbs with in­
tensification of meaning from stem Illforms of
verbs.   There is no common translation for this
morpheme.     The suffix [sj has two morphologically
conditioned allomorphs:         following verbs of
conjugation classes B, C, D, K, and L, which
have long vowel allomof’phs of the stem formant
{a}, it has the shape /*s/; elsewhere it has the
shape /s/.
    Examples are:
    /duya*/         ’to give'
    /doyi«sa/         'to be generous'
    /toq/        'to stand up something long'
    /toqesa/        'to be sterile'
    /ca*wa/         'to sing'
    /ca»wisa/         'to be chock full    of song'
    / cun/       'to urinate'
    /cunesa/         'not to be able to    control bladder'
    /kur/        'to be fertile'
    /kuresa/        'to be full of semen'
    /qota*/         'to be strong, hard, or deep'
    /qoti»sa/         'to be full of strength'

     2.2.    Classification of verbs.   Verbs are
classified as dependent, independent, or auxiliary
on the basis of the coincidence of syntactic function
and morphological structure.    Any verb may be
morphologically marked as syntactically dependent
by the suffixation of one of a small number of
subordinating morphemes as the final suffix.        Verbs
not so marked are syntactically independent, i.e.,
capable in themselves of constituting independent
clauses.    Auxiliaries are distinguished phonologically
by an intervening hyphen juncture when postposed to
independent verbs; morphologically by their anomalous
stem formation, their unique privilege of occurrence
with certain inflectional suffixes, and their inability
to occur with the subordinating suffixes forming
dependent verbs, to which they may be postposed.*
     Verbs are marked as being syntactically
dependent by the final position suffixation of
*Ivlost auxiliaries only occur postposed, but can be
 elicited as free forms in isolation.
one of the following subordinating suffixes,
previously discussed in section 2.1, Verb Structure.
    Suffixed to stem I:
    {r}      causal anteriority
    {?a}     temporal anteriority
    {-kan}   contradictory simultaneity
    Suffixed to stem II:
    {n}      potential temporal simultaneity
    {so}     necessary temporal anteriority
    A subclass of verbs which are syntactically
intransitive are morphologically distinguishedby the suffixation of one of a small number of
derivational suffixes.     These form stative or
adjectival verbs.    The suffixes are both root-
and stem-deriving.
    Root-deriving suffix;
    (el}
    Stem-deriving suffixes affixed to stem III:    [hi
    {s}
    Morphological structure and syntactic com­
binatory possibilities divide the fourteen aud-
liarieB into two main     classes:   copulas and
attributive auxiliaries.     The copulas are of two
types^ while the attributive auxiliaries are of
four main types with an additional derivative type.
    Two types of copulas, which include1three
auxiliaries, are distinguished by morphological
composition and external functioning;      independent
and dependent.   In addition, internal reconstruction
seems to indicate that, unlike the attributive
auxiliaries, both types of copulas are based on
pronominal roots.     The first fcype^ that of the
independent copulas, comprehends two verbs;
{9iy} and {9uw}, which are distinguished from
the other auxiliaries in that they are never
post-posed, and may occur as both main verbs and
auxiliaries with no change in patterns of stem
formation, suffixation potential, or semantic
function.   They differ from each other in stem
allomorphy and in the class of suffixes which can
be affixed to them.     In terms of inflectiunal
suffixation potential they have complementary
privileges of occurrence, {^iy} being only
followed by the personal inflectional suffixes,
while f’uw} is directly followed hy the stem II
modal suffixes.     Only [’uwj is followed “by a
stem-deriving derivational suffix.
    The general verb of doiig (proximal) or
being {9iy} commonly translates as *being, using,
or doing (nearby),1 or is untranslated when
occurring in periphrastic constructions with other
auxiliaries.     Diachronically, it is probably to
be internally reconstructed as based on the
                   *
demonstrative root 9E. (Compare the forms
/9eh/, /’ew/ 'this.')
    Examples are;
    /nis holowi kuyar 9iye kirkelesken/            'You
         were trying to scare me'
   / 9uni 9el-9ina*/       'He put them on his face'
   /turn te*da 9isuk/        'he blushed'
   /pa*lel hara* 9isuk/         'Two of them went'
    /calit su*s 9iye 9ibi»da/        'I was always
         good'
   /calit 9iye 9ibe*/         'He was always good'
    /pi neto 9iye 9ibe»/        'That one is mine'
    /?el-9iye/        'to put in horizontally'
   /ken-9iye/         'to put in vertically downward'
                                                              166
     /*?eh 9iyeda/     'I did this just now'
     /9eh 9isken/      'You did this just now'
     /9ewet 9is-kuyam/      'Do yo\i want to use this?'
     /9eh 9is-kuda/      'I want to do this'
     /mato kelekele 9iyeda/       'I used your knife'
     /9iye bint^-e*/     'I hear them doing it1
     /ne*l 9iyeda/       'We did it right now'
     /ne*l 9iye 9ise»da/       'We   did it'
     /ne«l 9iye 9idi«da/       'We   are the very same two'
     The general verb of doing (distal) or being
[*?uwj commonly translates 'to do', or 'be' (in that
manner or further away), or is untranslated when
occurring in periphrastic constructions with other
auxiliaries.   Diachronically, it is probably to be
internally reconstructed as based on the demonstrative
root *9u.   (Compare the form /9uku/ 'that.')     The
copula [’uwj has the stem shapes     /9uwe/ for   stem I,
/9ud/ for stem II, and /9us/     for stem III. The stem   I
form is never followed by further inflectional suffixation.
To stem II are suffixed the stem-deriving causative suffix
}m] and four stem II inflectional suffixes: the
passive {here}, the inevitable
future {le}, the first person dual hortative
 fa*}, and the negative {mina}.     Li^e the copula
{9iy}, attributive auxiliaries are suffixed, not
post-posed, to two stem forms of the copula j’uwj
The aspectual attributive {bly} is siiffixed to
the stem I form, while the modal attributive
{kUy} is suffixed to stem III.
    Examples are;
   /^uhChJeres-to•t/         'the wounded, forbidden
         one to whom it happened'
   /'hzhChJeres/       'that one indicated' (cf, /*?
         'this one'
   /^uwe/      ’just that way, anyway'
   /’uwe ^iye ^ibe*/         'They did it anyway'
   / 9uwe 9is biyak/        'does it any old way'
   / ’uwe hara* ?ise*da ma*n/        'I went along
         anyway'
   /*?uwe cipada ma*n/        'I hit them anyway'
   /’uwe bukama/         'to contradict' (/bukama/
         'to strongly contradict')
   /9uwe bukama wirada *?elehe^an/        'They
         didn't want me to come, but I came
         against their will'
    /?uwebele»s/           'Don't, you shouldn't do that'
            (weak prohibition)
    /^uwebele*s mi *?uhmina/            'You shouldn't do
            that'
    /^uh/           'You do it1
    /‘?uhe«/         'Let's you and I do it'
    /*?uhle*s          'might do it'
    /9uhle/            'Let's      alldo it'
    /'hihhida/      'It was said       to me’
    /^uhheresken/          'I see it was said toyou’
    /^uni “hihe*/         'Let's do it that way'
    /'?uhma*/         'That's the way to do it' (causative
            with adverbial force)
    /be*di ‘hihmina/            'Don't do that'
    The second type of copula, the dependent,
comprehends a single auxiliary, the neutral stative
verb of being {^el}, which marks statements as
being known from first hand observation to be true,
and therefore is frequently translated 'I see/saw.'
It differs from the independent copulas in that it
may be post-posed, and never occurs as a main
verb, and from both the independent copulas
and the other attributive auxiliaries in that it
                                                             169
has a single stem form which is only followed by a
single suffix.   It has the stem form /^ele*/ except
when suffixed to the nominalized stem III form of
one of three aspectual auxiliaries:     {bly}, {bUhj, or
{suk}, when it has the shape /ile*/.      These appear
to be stem I forms, by reason of the quality and length
of the vowel and the fact that only a stem I inflectional
suffix, the dubitative {in}, may be affixed.     Diachronieally,
it seems likely that {^el} is to be internally
reconstructed as based on the demonstrative root
-^E plus the stative root-deriving suffix {el}
(previously discussed in Section 2.1.).
     Examples are;
    /bo*sile«/          '(I saw them) sitting there'
    /be»sile«/       '(I saw them) lying there'
    /su*sile«/          'to be standing (visibly)'
    / ca*wa be*sile*/        'I see/saw them singing,
          they are/were singing'
    /ca*wa be*sile*m/        'I guess I saw them singing'
    /ba»-betan ca*wa-be•sile*m/          'He was singing
          while eating'
    /ca*wa *?ele*/        'I saw them sing right now,
          they just now sang'
    /bukul ^ol-poyo'ka ^ele*/         'I see the dust
          is rising/has risen'
    /qewel-to* be*sile*/         'I saw that there
          was a house there, there was a house
          there (I saw)1
   /hari*l wira ^ele*/          'I see they're going
          to take them'
   /nor hara* *?ele*m/         'Someone's going south'
    /nor hara* ^ele*/         'They just went by
          gojrg south'
    /memin ^alu'qa *?ele»/        'There is/was a
          reflection in the water'
    .»       »                            ,
    /Xa*qum Xo *ma *?ele* bohemin soni*n/          'I
          seen them kill a rattlesnake with a big
          rock, recently/right now/immediately past'
    The four main types of attributive auxiliaries
are aspectual auxiliaries, modal auxiliaries,
temporal auxiliaries, and auxiliaries of possi­
bility.   They are distinguished from each other
on the basis of the co-incidence of syntactic
function, morphological structure, phonological
shape, and semantic range.    While based on roots
from which main verbs are also formed, attributive
auxiliaries are themselves never main verbs,
but are always syntactically unilaterally
dependent on main verbs.
    The aspectual auxiliaries are distinguished
from the other attributive auxiliaries by their
ability to be followed by the personal subject
suffixes [da] and {skenj, and to occur as im­
peratives.   The aspectuals are further divided
into two subclasses.    The first subclass of as­
pectual auxiliaries has three members based on
roots indicating position or location, while the
latter class has two members based on roots
indicating motion toward or away from the speaker.
    The three members of the first subclass,
{bly}, [bUh], and {suk}, also share a morphopho-
nernic distinction.   The disyllabic stem I fams all
have a contracted monosyllabic alternant of the
shape CV* before the first person subject suffix
{da}.   If the medial consonant is a semivowel,
the vowel of the contracted    monosyllabic alternant
is the same in quality as that of the first
syllable of the disyllabic stem form.        If the medial
consonant is not a semivowel, the vowel of the
contracted monosyllabic stem alternant is identical
in quality with that of the vowel in the second
syllable of the disyllabic alternant.        In formulaicterms:   civiyV2 ^ C1V1* wllile civic""~yv2 ^ C1V2**
    The stem II and III forms of {bly} and {bUh}
also seem to be the result of a similar contraction.
When followed by further suffixation they have the
shape CV*, the vowel being of the quality one
would expect from the operation of the morphopho-
nemic rules for JlJJ and Qujj in an uncontractedstem II form of the shape C^V^^u or an uncontractedstem III form of the shape C2ViC2i *          fornlulaicterms:   c i vi G2V2   C1V1 **
    Thus for stem II:
    {bly] {u}:flblyufl: beyu;/be*/
    (bUh} {u}: llbUhull: bohu: / b o * /    For stem III:
    {bly} {i } {s }jIblyisfl :%eyis;/be*s/
    {bUh}{i}{s}:flbUhisQ: bohis:/bo*s/
    In addition, two members {bly} and {bUh} have
an additional stem II form used only for the
imperative, and distinguish formally the two
                                                         173
polarities is the range of meaning of the dubitative
inflectional suffix [inj .   This suffix, which is
affixed to stem I forms of verbs, is affixed to
both the stem I and stem II forms of the aspect
auxiliaries {bly} and {bUh} with a concomitant
semantic distinction.     When the dubitative is
suffixed to stein I forms it only translates as'a
second person weak interrogative, while when
suffixed to stein II forms it translates as a
doubtful or probable statement.
        The imperfect aspect attributive auxiliary
{bly} characteristically participates in predications
which are generally, reliably, and continuingly
true.     It is commonly translated by a progressive
tense in English.     Diachronically, it appears to
be internally reconstructed as based on the root
{bly} 'to be in a lying position,' from which
main verbs are now formed.      The stem I form of the
imperfective auxiliary has the contracted shapes
/bi*/ before the evidential suffixes, and the
shape /biya/ elsewhere.      The stem II form has the
contracted shape /be/ when it functions as the
imperative, and the shape /be*/ elsewhere.      The
                                                                174
stera III form is /be»s/.     All stem forms only
occur suffixed to the copula roots {^iy} and
[’uwj or postposed to main verbs.         The stem I
inflectional suffixes {nthere}, {kele }, and {re*},
are suffixed to the contracted allomorph of stem
I, /bi/, while the stem I inflectional suffixes
{^el}, {m}, and (k} are suffixed to /biya/, and the
suffix {da} is, of course, affixed to the contracted
allomorph /bi*/.
     Examples are:
     /        »     »
     /ba*-be*tan ca*wa besile*m/           'He was singing
          while eating1
     /suke-bire*/       'I guess they are (standing)1
     /biya-bire*/       'I guess they are (lying)'
     /wira-bire*/        'They must be coming'
     /hara*bire*/        'They must be going'
     /wirwira-binthik/         'I heard them a-coming
          some time ago'
     /pi neto ‘-
               ’iye *?ibe*/       'That is mine'
     /ba* ^ibi^da/        'I'm eating*
     /ba* ^ibe^sken/      'You're eating'
     /ba* ^ibe*(m)/       'They're eating’
     /pi po*m be*le-bo*m/         'That    ground will always
          be there'

    /calit be*le-bo•sken/          'You will always
         be good'
    /calit be:le-ba*da/            'I'll always be good*
    /calit    biya ^ikilak ni/     'I used to be   good'
    /calit    su*s 9iye ?ibi*da/ 'I was always     good'
    /calit    ^iye ^ibe*/          'He is always   good'
    /ho*n calit     ^iye ?ibe*/    'He always was good1
    /bewi*l biyak/          'They two are always   sleeping
          together'
    /ca*wa-be•sile•/        'I saw him singing'
    /ca*wa ^ibe^wi*/        'Are they singing?'
    /ca*wa ^ibiyam/         'Are you singing?'
    /ca*wa *?ibe*m/         'They are singing (doubtfully)'
     The durative aspect attributive auxiliary
{bUh} emphasizes the duration or Extension in time
of the action expressed by the predication.        It
commonly translates in English as 'keep on doing
always       sometimes..., remain...,' or 'still....'
Diachronically, it appears to be internally recon­
structed as based on the root fbllh} 'to be in a
sitting position, to remain, to reside,' from which
main verbs are formed at present.      Unlike {bly},
the durative auxiliary has only contracted stem forms.
Stem I has the shape /ba*/, stem. II has the shape
/boh/ when functioning as an imperative, but
/bo*/ elsewhere, and stem III has the shape /bo*s/.
All stem forms only occur postposed.     The stern I
inflectional suffixes {da}, {k}, and {m} are
affixed to stem I, the suffix {111} may also be
affixed to stem II, as is the suffix {sken}.      The
stem I evidential suffixes and the stem II modal
suffixes are never affixed to the durative {bUh};
thus it is in nearly complementary distribution
with the imperfective auxiliary {bly}.
     Examples are;
     /pi po*m be*le-bo*m/      'That ground will
          always be there'
     /calit be*le-bo•sken/     'You will always be good
     /calit be*le-ba*da/       'I'll always be good'
     /calit sukle-bo*rn        'He'll always be
          good (probably)'
     /9elewle-bo*m he*sin claumina/        'He never
          will be good'
     / okla* kenehale-bo*m/       'He might get good'
     /pur bo*t haras kuda/        'If they were there
          I'd go'
     /miya ma*n minele*bo•sken/        'You too shall
          die, be dead'
                                                           177     /be-le-bo*m/      'It shall remain'
     /mutie-bo•sken/   'You shall hear it, you can't
          help it'
     /ca«wa-ba*m/      'Do you sometimes   sing?'
     /ni ca*wa-ba*k/   'I sing once in a while,
           sometimes I sing'
     /^uni ni *?iye-ba*k/       'That's the way I do it'
     The perfective aspect attributive auxiliary {sukj
emphasizes the punctual, completed, non-durative
nature of the predication.     It commonly translates
in English as simple past.     Diachronically, it
seems to be internally reconstructable as based
on the root {sukj 'to be in a standing position,1
from which main verbs are derived at present.       Stem
I has the shape /se*ya/ when followed by the
dubitative {m}, and the contracted shape /se-/
elsewhere; stem II has the shape /su*/ when followed
by the second person subject suffix {sken}, and the
shape /suk/ elsewhere; stem III has the shape
/su«s/.   The stem I form /se/ and the stem II
allomorph /su*/ only occur suffixed to the copula root
{9i} and postposed, while the stem III /su*s/ only
occurs postposed.    The inflectional suffixes {da}
and {m} are affixed to the stem I allomorph /se*/»
the dubitative suffix {111} is also suffixed to the
stem I allomorph /se*ya/, and the stem II inflectional
suffixes {le} and {i*} are affixed to the stem II
                                                           178allomorph /suk/.
     Examples are:
     /calit-su*s 7iye *?ibi*da/          'I was always good*
     /calit sukle-bo*m/        'HdUl always be good1
     /ca*wa ^ise'ia/          'Did you sing?'
     /ba* ^ise/yain/          'Did you eat?'
     /ba* ^ise*/       'They ate'
     /ba* 9isuki*/     'Did they eat?'
     /ba»s-kuda 9ise*da/        'I wanted to eat'
     /ba*-be*tan ca*wa 9isuk/       'He was singing
          while eating (in past)’
      ,i          j                      .
     /\o*ma ^isuk Aa*qum boherain soni*n/          'She
          killed a rattlesnake with a big rock
          recently'
     The two members of the second subclass of
aspectual auxiliaries,    {wlr}, and {har}, are both
never suffixed to the copula root {9i}.
     The future intentional, aspect attributive auxiliary
{wlr} emphasizes the intentional or volitional
nature of an act about to take place.        It commonly
translates as 'to be about to..., going to....'
Diachronically, it appears to be internally reconstructed
as derived from a root {wlr} 'to come, to move toward
the speaker.'   Like the durative and i.aperfective
aspect auxiliaries,    {wlr} has a contracted, monsyllabic
alternant of stem I, /wi/, which occurs before the
                                                      179
suffixes [da} and [nthere}, and a disyllabic
alternant /wira/, which occurs elsewhere.   The
stein II form has the shape /war/ as an imperative,
and the shape /wer/ before {mina}, and the shape /were/
   i
                                                              180
                                                         i
elsewhere, while the stem III form has the
shape /weres/.   Unlike any other verb in the
language, this imperative form is morphologically
marked for number.    The singular imperative is
/war/, the dual /walel/, and the plural /wata*rum/.
The associated suffixes are all treated under the
pronoun; see Section3.2.    All     stem forms occur
post-posed.
    Examples are:
    /hari*l-wida/        ’I am about to take them*
    /hari*1-weresken/       'I see you're about to
         take them1
    /hari*l-weres/        'They're about to take
         them, the one who's about to take them'
    /hari*l-wira ^ele*/           'I see they're going
         to take them'
   /hari’l-wint^e•/         'They just keep on coming'
   /hari-l-wint^ik/         'They were coming some
         time ago (maybe they didn't arrive)1
    The progressive aspect attributive auxiliary
[har}, of rare occurrence, emphasizes the progressive
and often future nature of an act.       It translates
as 'while ...-ing,' and 'during             Diachronically,
                                                           181
it seems to be internally reconstructed as
derived from a root fhar} 1tu move away from the
speaker.'    Only a stem I form without further
suffixation and a stem III form with {s}, the
generic aspect suffix are attested in this corpus;/hara*/«
     Examples are;
     /wira-hara*/         'while, during the course of
            his coming'
     /kiye*-haras biyak./         'He's getting old.'
     /ciri*ka-haras biyak./       'He's getting skinny.1
     /ni ma*n qati• kiye*-hara» bint^ida/         'As
            for me, I go on growing older.'
     The modal auxiliaries are distinguished from
the other attributive auxiliaries by their inability
to be follwed by the second person suffix {sken}.
There are three modal auxiliaries; the desiderative,
the conditional, and the optative.
     The desiderative .mode attributive auxiliary
{kUy} indicates intention, preference, or desire.
It is commonly translated 'want,' or 'try'.
Diachronically, it seems to be internally reconstructed
as based on the ro t {kUy} 'to ache, to be sick,
                                                               182to hurt.'     Like the aspectual auxiliaries it has a
contracted allomorph of stem I before {da}, /ku/
(which follows the same morphophonemic pattern
previously described), and the allomorph /kuya/ else­
where.     The stem II form is /koyu/.      The inflectional
suffix {in} is affixed to the stem I allomorph /kuya/,
while the inflectional suffix {da} is affixed to
the contracted form /ku/.       All stems are postposed.
        Examples are:
        /9ewet ^is-kuyam/        'Do you want to use this?'
        /9eh ^is-kuda/       'I want to do this'
        /ba«s-kuda/       'I want to eat'
        /ba*s-kuya ^ise^da/        'wanted to eat'
        /^oqci-kuda/        'I feel nauseasted, I want to
             vomit, I will vomit'
        /9us-koyu/       'Try to do it I'
        /pur bo»t haras-kuda/        'If they   were there
             I'd g o '
        The conditional and optative mode attributive
auxiliaries differ from the desiderative.          They
have no imperatives, and they are defective, being
marked for only a single stem form.
        The conditional mode attributive auxiliary
{kil} frequently translates as 'might, if ..., when
....'     It may be diachronically related to a number
                                                             183
of other morphemes of similar shape; the warning
inflectional suffix {ken}, the optative auxiliary
{keneh} (^*l{ken}    {ij {h}?), the hearsay evidential
{kele}, the nominal suffix {ken}, which translates
as 'maybe,1 or the nominal suffix {ken} which
emphasizes an individual at the expense of all
other individuals that might have been included in
the expectation.     The stem of the conditional
auxiliary has a contracted shape /ki/ when followed
by the first person subject suffix {da}, and the
shape /fcila/ elsewhere.   These are probably two
allomorphs of stem I since they only occur with
the stem I inflectional suffixes {kele}, {re*},
{*=■«!1. lie}, and {da}.   When the conditional
auxiliary is followed by the completive suffix {k},
it is obligatorily suffixed itself to the copula
root {9i}.
     Examples are;
     /le*nda cala* keneha kila9el/         'He might
             have been good yesterday,1'
     / 9uni 9isto* kilake*/       'It was said just like
             that, it was supposed to have been said
             just like that'
     /bula kila mi koyule*s/        'If you drank it you'd
             get sick'
                                                          184
   /wirwira kila/      'when they all get here'
   /^uni ^isto* kilake*/         'It is supposed
        to have heen said like that'
   /ba* kila^el/      'They must have eaten'   /hari*l kilake*/          'I heard they took them'
   /tepca kilake*/     'Once upon a time ...'(lit:
         'I heard it may have/supposed to have been
         transformed that'
   /*?uni kilake*/     'That's the way it is
         supposed to have been said*
   /ba* kila kija^ise *da/       'Perhaps because of
         eating I got sick'
   /calit biya ^ikilak ni/          'I used to be good'
   /hari*l kida/      ' I might take them'
    The optative mode attributive auxiliary
{keneh}, commonly translates as 'might,' or 'may.'
It may be diachronically related to one or all of
a number of morphemes with similar shapes listed
under the discussion of the optative {kil}.        The
optative {keneh} has a single stem form /keneha/
which may be a stem II form since it is only
followed by a single stem II inflectional suffix,
the inevitable future {le}.
                                                              185
    Examples are:
    /cala* kenehale-bo*m/            ’He might get good'
    /le*nda cala* keneha kila^el/            'He might
             have been good yesterday'
    /hara• kenehale•s/           '(They) might go'
    /hara» kenehale/            'What do you say we
             might all go, we'11 all go'
    /‘hini nis keneha yecule»s/           'They could/might
          . ' name me'
    /*?uni kenehale*s/           'It could be that way'
    /^uni kenehale•sken/            'Y0u might do it
             that way, you could if you wanted to'
    /ca»wa kenehale»s/           '(They) might sing'
    /hari*l kenehale*s/            'I see you must
             have taken them'
    The single temporal attributive auxiliary {kir]
is distinguished from the other attributive auxiliaries
by its inability to occur unsuffixed, or to occur
with the personal suffixes {da] and {sken] directly
suffixed to its stem form, or to occur as an im­
perative, or to be suffixed to the copula root
{*?iy].     The temporal auxiliary {kir] marks the
past tense, and commonly translates as the simple
past in English.         It is followed by only three
                                                          186
inflectional suffixes: the evidentials {nt^ere},
{kele}, and (re1}.    It has the shape /ki/ when followed
""by the evidential suffix {nt^ere}, and the shape /kir/
when followed by the other suffixes.      These seem
to be allomorphs of a stem I since all the suffixes
which may be affixed to it are stem I inflectional
suffixes.
     Examples are:
     /ko •m neto ba*s ba*-kire*m/       'They must
            have eaten up all my food1
     /wuha* 9imit 9uyu*la-kirke •/      'The milk
            became sour'
     /wirwira-kinthe •/        'They came (I heard them)'
     /wirwira-kint^ik/         'They came some time ago
            (first hand knowledge)'
     //ca*wa-kire•/
       f          /
                           'They must have sung'
     /ca*wa kint^e^m/      'They sang, I guess, I
            heard about it1
     /xal qolin ti*n kinthe*/         'They spoke a
            different language'
     The attributive auxiliaries of possibility
are distinguished from the other auxiliaries by the
fact that they are always postposed to stem III forms
of verbs, only occur in a single stem form without
allomorphy, never occur with the second person
subject suffix [sken], have no imperative, and
are never suffixed to the copula root {^iy].
     The attributive auxiliary of possibility
{pin} indicates inability and commonly translates
as 'to be unable, to have none,1 or 'to lack.'
It has a single stem form /pina*/ to which may be
suffixed only the first person subject suffix {da}
     Examples are:
    /ca*wule•s-pina•da/       'I am unable to sing'
    / t^ewle•s-pina* da/      'I am unable to fly'
    /bo*s-pina* pe*l/       'They two are homeless'
    /be*le*s-pina*/         'can't stay overnight'
    /hurle•s-pina* da/      'I cannot sew'
    / ca*wi-pina•da/        'I have nothing to sing
          I have no song1
    The attributive auxiliary of possibility
{lei} indicates ability and commonly translates
as 'can, so that I can....'     It has a single stem
form /leli/ to which is suffixed only the parti­
cular aspect suffix {t }.
    Examples are;
    /si*wi caluma tatiqpaqat net haras-leli/
         'Fix me out writing so that I can go (write
         me a note so that I will be able to g o )1
    /conos-leli/     'in order to dance'
   /ni haras-lelit be*le*s/         'I ought to go,
         might be able to go'
    /hestule*s ni haras-lelit be*mina/        'I
         wonder if I'll be able to go?'
   /net ca»wi-leli be#le»s/        'I might be able
         to sing/
    The attributive auxiliary of possibility {top},
the usitative, indicates customary predications,
and is commonly translated as '... used to ....'
It has a single stem form /topi/ to which is
suffixed only the particular aspect suffix {t}.
    Examples are:
   /Xo*mi-topi/      'used to killing/murdering*
   /pi ken\a*s-topi be*m/        'That's a chair,' (lit
         'that is used for sitting')
                                                               189
    /be*s-topi/         'bed1, (lit: nominalized form
             of 'to lie down --usually')
     Two preverbs, the prohibitive /be*di/ and the
negative /9elew/, are distinguished on the basis of
their syntactic pattern.       Morphologically, they seem
to be subtypes     of auxiliaries, /be*di/ being
possibly reconstructed as the contracted stem II
form of the imperfective a pect attributive auxiliary
{bly} plus the privative *w with the hortative suffix
{di}, and /9elew/ possibly being the s t e m form of the
neutral stative copula {9el} plus the privative
suffix *w.
     While /be*di/ appears only in this form,
/9elew/ has two stem forms to which are affixed the
inflectional suffixes [da], {mj, {sj, and {here}.
Stem I has two allomorpiiic shapes: /9elewa/ before
the dubitative {m} and /9elew/ elsewhere.       Stem II
has the contracted shape /9ele*s/.
     Examples are:
     / 9elewda haras koyumina/        'I don't want to go'
     / 9elewam haras koyumina/        'You don't want to go'
     /9elew-be*m haras koyumina/ 'They don't want to go'
     /9ele•s-biyak harmina/           'He never does go'
     /9elew-be•sken hara*-wermina/         'I was not
             supposed to go'
/?elew-war/      1Don1t venture['
/‘?elewle-bo »ra he*sin calumina/    ’He never
     will be good1
/^elewhetan harma*s koyumina hara* ^isuk/
     'He went away in spite of me'
           3.     Substantive.   Substantives as a group
differ from verbs in demonstrating case, number,
and aspectual categories.        Internal structural
differences divide them into two types:        those
formed directly from roots, and those based on
forms of complex derivation (radicals) or stems.
Inflectional differences divide them ito two
classes:     noun and pronoun.    Nouns are inflected
for three morphological cases, two aspects,
occasionally for diminutive, or plural, and
can be followed by postclitics, whereas pronouns
are marked for three iersons, three numbers,
three cases, and may be optionally followed by
a small class of suffixes.
           3.1.    Noun.   The sequences of morphemes
to which the nominal inflectional suffixes are
added constitutes the noun theme.        The noun
theme consists of two elements:        an optionally
final position class of thematic aspect suffixes
and a stem.       The stem position may be filled by a
verb stem, most frequently stem III, a radical,
or a root.      Like verbs, nouns are divided into
classes depending on the number of themes they
show and the allomorphy of each thematic suffix
The eighteen classes of nouns are charted below
followed by examples of each class.

     The two mutually exclusive inflectional
thematic suffixes of aspect mark the noun as of
particular or generic aspect.     Only one class of
nouns, Glass N, includes members which appear
unmarked for aspect distinction.      Four other classes,
A, 0, P, and Q, have members which are only marked
for one aspect, the particular.     The members of all
other classes are distinguished for both aspects.
     The particular aspect specifies a live, animate,
or whole individual, a group considered as a unit
contrasting with another mass, or an action which is
punctual rather than durative; in short, a particular
individuated from the mass or genos.      The generic
defines a mass in general,
a group, a plurality, or simply an unspecified,
not particularized, individual, class, or genos.
Thus nouns referring to particular people, proper
names, live animals, personified entities, and
                                     r1  i
paired body parts when prefixed with lean) 'one
side, half' occur in t.ie particular aspect.
Nouns referring to manufactured things, masses
such as fire, wood, water, pus, and smoke, geo­
graphical terms such as creek, flat valley, road,
trail, and land, calendar units, and body parts
except the heart occur in the generic aspect.
Nouns based on verb stem III often translate
as the action or material in the generic, /Xahi/
                Vi
'doctoring', /t uli/ 'swimming', /waci/ 'weeping',
but as the actor in the particular, /Xalit/
'doctor', /thulit/ 'otter', /wacit/ 'the one who
is crying'.
     Some substantives occur in only one aspectual
category, but may be potentially extended to the
other aspect.   For example, particular people
typically occur in the particular, but may also
be marked for the generic, just as in English,
proper names generally occur without articles
but may be particularized by tne use of 'the' as
                                                              197
in 'the ToaLfe: I've known....'
      The generic and particular aspects of sub­
stantives have varying translations in English which
seem most often to involve animate/inanimate, singular/
plural distinctions.     Since the translation rarely
accurately expresses the aspectual contrast, the range
of meanings expressed by aspectual distinctions is
illustrated by a few examples.

       The inflectional thematic suffix of par­
ticular aspect {tj has three morphologically
conditioned allomorphs:         /t/, /h/, and /•/•      It
has the shape /t/ when affixed to members of noun
declension classes A, B, A, D, E, and F; /h/ when
affixed to members of classes G, H, I, J, K, 0,
and Pj and /•/ when affixed to members of classes
M and Q.      The particular aspect suffix does not
occur on members of classes A, B, C, D, E, F, L,
and 0 if inflectional case suffixes follow
       Examples   of the allomorphs of [t] are;
/V as in Class B;           / sedet/    'Coyote' subject, but
                            / sedem/    'Coyote' objectM     as in Class G;        /koloh/     'basket' subject

     The inflectional thematic suffix of generic
aspect {s} has seven morphologically conditioned
allomorphs:   /s/, /t/, /w/, /y/, /m/, /n/, and /•/.
It has the shape / s/ when affixed to members of
classes C, L, and M; /t/ when affixed to members
of class B; /w/ when affixed to members of classes
E, F, and I; /y/ when affixed to members of classes
J and K; /m/ when affixed to members of class G;
/n/ when affixed to members of class H; and /•/
when affixed to members of classes D and J.         The
allomorphs /y/ and /vt/ only occur on members of
classes K and F respectively if case inflectional
suffixes follow.     The allomorph /•/ only occurs
on members of class J if inflectional suffixes
do not follow.
     Examples of the allomorphs of {s} are;
/s/ as in class C:     /tulcuheres/     'the one it is
                                         taboo to touch'

                         /siwiyum/ 'testicles' object
      The three mutually exclusive final position
inflectional suffixes of case morphologically
mark several syntactic relations:       object, possessor,
agent, instrument, and location.       Members of all
classes are not attested occurring ifr all three
cases in both aspects, although some are.        Whether
this is a factor of class membership, the moribund
                                                        201state of the language, or the difficulties in
eliciting categories which are only indirectly
translatable into English, is at present im­
possible to determine.     Nouns unmarked for case,
that is, marked only for aspect, function syn­
tactically as subjects.    Nouns inflected for
particular aspect function as subjects of active
and medio-passive verbs.    Nouns inflected for generic
aspect also function as subjects of active and
medio-passive verbs, and as noun attributives.
     The inflectional suffix {urn}, the object
case, marks nouns and phrases as objects of
transitive and medio-passive verbs.     This suffix
has two phonologically conditioned variants:     /um/
following consonants, and /m/ following vowels, which
alternate morphologically with /s/ when affixed
directly to the first and second person pronominal
roots {ni} and {mi}, and /t/ when affixed to in­
alienably possessed nouns, to /pu/, an allomorph
of the third person pronominal root {pi}, and when
affixed to /^ewe/, an allomorph of {9e}, the third
person pronominal root.
     Examples are;
    /sedem/     'Coyote' particular object
                                                     202
/sedetum/          'coyote(s)' generic object
/curucurum/           'a brown cricket' particular
        object
/curucurutum/          'brown cricket(s)'
        generic object
/sulehum/           'water oak acorn'   particular object
/suleyum/           'water oak acorn(s)' generic
        object
/nis/       'me'
/mis/       'yoti1
/put/       'him'
/*?ewet/         'this one'
/net lehet/          'my younger brother (refer­
        ential)'     inalienable object
   /harasum/         'while it is going,' lit:     'the
          going' generic object
   /nis ha*-be*sum wirier hara* /isuk./          'They
          left me because/while they saw me eating,
          lit:     'They left because of seeing me
          eating
    The inflectional suffix {un}, the genitive
case, marks nouns as possessors and as agents
(subjects) of passive verbs.     This suffix has
two phonologically conditioned variants:      /un/
following consonant^ and /n/ following vowels.
     Examples are;
    /seden/        'Coyote's,by Coyote' particular
          genitive
    /sedetun/         'coyote(s)'s, by the coyote(s)
          generic genitive
    /curueurun/         'a brown cricket's, by the
          brown cricket' particular genitive
    /curucurutun/         'brown cricket(s)'s , by
          the brown crickets' generic genitive
    /sulehun/        'of/by   the water oak acorn'
          particular genitive
    /suleyun/        'of/by   the water oak acorn(s)'
          generic genitive
                                                       204
    /wimayun po • leacuhedi./      'May he now be
          chewed up by the grizzly hear!' (grizzly
          bear generic genitive /wimayun/)
    /boyun winhida./        'I am being seen by a
          lot of them.'
     The inflectional suffix {in}, the locative
case, marks nouns for spatial or temporal location,
instrumentality, and attribution.       It has two
phonologically conditioned variants:       /in/
after consonants and /*n/ after vowels and /n/
after long vowels.
     Examples are:
    /thaki«n/        'in, on the hat'
    /la»hun qedewin buha xilit/          'The fly
          sat on the older sister's arm1
     /qedewin Xeyhida./       'I was hit by the arm'
    /ba*s-bo*sin net, nis Xiya./           'While/because
          I was eating, they threw rocks at me,' lit.,
          'For my eating, (they) threw (rocks) (at)
          me'
     /minelesin/       'after dying ...'
     /xilit buha kahayin./       'The fly sat on
          the fingernail' (generic locative)
                                                             205
          /xilit dile kahahin./       'The fly alighted
               on the fingernail1 (partipular locative)
          /heke*n/    'whereat'
          Two additional inflectional case suffixes
     are distinguished for inalienably possessed
     nouns and pronouns;     the instrumental and the
     dependent possessive.
          The inflectional case suffix {r}, the instru­
     mental, morphologically distinguishes the syntac­
     tic function of instrument from that of possession
     marked by the genitive case suffix {un}.     The
     genitive marks both functions when occurring with
     alienably possessed nouns.    The   instrumental {i*}
     has two phonologically conditioned variants:
     DVrfl when affixed to monosyllabic stems ending in
     /h/, and /r/ elsewhere.     When affixed to stems
     ending in a consonant, excepting monosyllabic
     stems ending in /h/, it replaces the consonant.
     They alternate morphologically with /i*n/ when {r}
     is affixed to /*?ew/, an allomorph of the third
     person proximal pronoun {9e}.
          Examples are;
/•
                                                    206

     /pulahar/         'by his older sister'
     /pune»r/       'by his mother'
     /ner/      'by me'
     /mar/      'by you'
     /pir/      'by him'
     The inflectional case suffix (t}, the possessive,
distinguishes in the pronoun the syntactic function
of possession from that of instrumentality marked
by the instrumental suffix (rj.       It has two morpho­
logically conditioned alternants:       /t/ affixed to
the first person exclusive pronominal root {ni},
and the second person pronominal root (mi}j /r/ when
affixed to the third person pronominal root (pi}
and the third person proximal pronominal root (9e}.
     Examples are:
     /net/      'my'
     /neto/      'mine'
     /mat/      'your'
    /mato/       'yours/
    /pur/       'hi s , hers'
    /9ewer/       'this one's'

     3.2.          Classification of Nouns.   There are
three classes:    alienably possessed, inalienably
possessed, and non-possessed.     Alienably possessed
nouns are optionally preceded by possessive pronouns,
or by a single prefix {can} 'half, one side;' are
inflected for two aspects; are inflected for
three cases:     object, genitive, and locative; may
be syntactically modified by the diminutive and
pejorative, as well as a few clitics such as the
disjunctive.     Inalienably possessed nouns are
always preceded by possessive pronouns, or a single
prefix, the vocative {ye}.     They are never marked
for aspect, but function as though inflected for
the particular and may or may not have an alienably
possessed counterpart functioning as a generic.
Inalienably possessed nouns are inflected for three
cases:   an object case like the alienably possessed
noun, a possessive case, and an instrumental case.
Both possessive and instrumental functions are
marked by a single case, the genitive, for
alienably possessed nouns.     Inalienably possessed
nouns, like alienably possessed nouns, may be
syntactically modified by the diminutive and
pejorative, as well as by a few clitics.
                                                     208
     Non-possessed. nouns never occur with possessive
pronouns or with prefixes, are maximally inflected
for two aspects and three cases, but are, in general,
not inflected for all cases in both aspects,
and are never syntactically modified by the
diminutive, pejorative, or by clitics.
     The clnss of alienably possessed nouns
is open in membership and constitutes the major
type of noun in Wintu, both in terms of the number
of forms, and the number of declension classes.
It has already been discussed in Section 3.1.
     The class of inalienably possessed nouns
is closed in membership, including only ten
members, all of which are kinship terms.   The
inalienably possessed nouns are characterized
by having the allomorph /t/ of the object case
inflectional suffix [urn} in addition to the
distinctions mentioned above.   The genitive case
inflectional suffix {un} when affixed to this
class of nouns, only marks the syntactic function
of possession; the instrumental case suffix {r},
which only occurs with inalienably possessed nouns
and pronouns, marks instrumentality.
                                                      209
     The class of non-possessed nouns is closed
in membership, containing 28 members.      Non-possessed
nouns are of two types:     dependent and independent.
     Three dependent nonpossessed nouns are clitics
and have disjunctive and adjectival functions,
while fourteen are compounded to substantive
stems, stustantive themes, or substantives in­
flected for case, and have adjectival function.
     The eleven independent non-possessed nouns
occur as full words and function as demonstratives,
interrogatives, and classifiers of quantity.
Although inflected maximally for both case and as­
pect, the aspect and case allomorphy is so anomalous
that no attempt has been made to establish sub­
classes of non-possessed nouns, paradigms being
given instead for each form.      In the following
paradigms, non-attested forms are marked by an
asterisk.","[78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 110, 111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 120, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125, 126, 127, 128, 129, 130, 131, 132, 133, 134, 135, 136, 137, 138, 139, 140, 141, 142, 143, 144, 145, 146, 147, 148, 149, 150, 151, 152, 153, 154, 155, 156, 157, 158, 159, 160, 161, 162, 163, 164, 165, 166, 167, 168, 169, 170, 171, 172, 173, 174, 175, 176, 177, 178, 179, 180, 181, 182, 183, 184, 185, 186, 187, 188, 189, 190, 191, 192, 193, 194, 195, 196, 197, 198, 199, 200, 201, 202, 203, 204, 205, 206, 207, 208, 209, 210, 211, 212, 213, 214, 215]"

     3.2.          Pronoun.    Two position classes of in­
flectional suffixes are affixed to pronominal
roots to form pronouns which maximally distinguish
three numbers;     singular, dual, and plural; six
cases;     subject, object, dependent possessive,
independent possessive, instrumental, and loca­
tive; and five persons:       first person exclusive,
first person inclusive, second person, third per­
son, third person proximal; and in one case two
aspects:    particular and generic.     Prom dual and
plural pronominal forms stems are formed which
inflect for aspect and case like the alienably
possessed nouns.     The pronominal forms, however,
are distinguished as a separate class by the unique
shape of the aspect and case suffix allomorp hy.
Prom singular, dual, and plural forms verbs are
derived which are a member of conjugation class N.
Summary charts of all pronominal forms are to be
found at the end of this section.
     There are five pronominal roots, all but
two of which show allomorphy, the allomorphy being
partially parallel.
     The first person exclusive pronominal root
{ni} indicates that the person addressed is
excluded.     It has three morphologically conditioned
allomorphs.    The root {ni} has the shape /ni/
when followed by /te/, an allomorph of the pro­
nominal plural suffix {te}, /s/, an allomorph
of the object case suffix {urn}, or when not
followed by further suffixation.     It has the
shape /ne/ when followed by /t/, an allomorph
of the pronominal possessive case suffix {t},
/r/, an allomorph of the instrumental case suffix
[rj, /*1/, an allomorph of the pronominal dual
suffix {*1}, or /le/, an allomorph of the prono­
minal plural suffix {te}.     It has the shape /niy/
when followed by the emphatic-independent pro­
nominal suffix {o}.
     The first person inclusive pronominal root
{pe} indicates that the person addressed is
included.     It has a single phonemic shape, /pe/.
It only occurs in the dual and plural numbers.
     The second person pronominal root {mi} has
four morphologically conditioned allomorphs.      The
root {mi} has the shape /mi/ when followed by /te/,
an allomorph of the pronominal plural suffix {te},
/s/, an allomorph of the object case suffix {um},
or when not followed by further suffixation.      It
                                                        217
has the shape /ma/ when followed by /t/, an allo­
morph of the pronominal possessive case suffix {t},
/r/, an allomorph of the instrumental case suffix
{r}, or when followed by the pronominal dual number
suffix /*l/ plus stem formants.    It has the shape
/me/ when followed by the pronominal dual number suf­
fix /*l/ alone, or the dual suffix plus the pronominal
stem formant {e} and the generic aspect suffix {s}.
Apparently as the result of analogy when inflected for
object or genitive cases in the generic aspect, there
are two competing second person pronominal stem forms:
one based on the allomorph /me/, the other on the
allomorph /ma/.   The second person pronominal root
{ini} has the shape /miy/ before the emphatic-indepen­
dent pronominal suffix {o}.
     The third person pronominal root {pi} indicates
any third person or thing.    When in contrast with the
pronominal root {9e}, the proximal, it is distal.      It
has four morphologically conditioned allomorphs.      The
root {pi} has the shape /pi/ when followed by /te/,
an allomorph of the pronominal plural number suffix
{te}, /r/, an allomorph of the instrumental
case suffix {r}, or
                                                      218when not followed by further suffixation.    It has the
shape /pu/ when followed ""by /t/, an ,allomorph of the
object case suffix [um}, A/, an allomorph of the
pronominal possessive case suffix ft}, or when followed
by the pronominal dual number suffix f•1} plus stem
formants.    It has the shape /pe/ when followed by the
pronominal dual number suffix {*1} alone, or the dual
suffix plus the pronominal stem formant {e}, and the
generic aspect suffix fs}.    Apparently as the result
of analogy, when inflected for object or genitive
cases in the generic aspect, there are two competing
third person pronominal stem forms, one based on the
allomorph /pe/ and the other based on the allomorph/pV.
       The third person proximal pronominal root
{*?e} distinguishes two aspects, particular and
generic, in singular subject forms, while aspect
is not distinguished for numbers or cases.    The
pronominal root {^e} has three morphologically
conditioned allomorphs.    It has the shape /^e/
when followed by /h/, an allomorph of the par­
ticular aspect suffix, /w/, an'allomorph of the
generic aspect siffix {s}, /ba/, an allomorph
of the plural suffix {te}.    It has the shape /’ewe/
when followed by /t/, an allomorph of the object
case suffix {urn}, /r/, an allomorph of the
pronominal possessive case suffix {t}, and the
dual suffix {*1}.    It has the shape /’ew/ when
followed by /i»n/, an allomorph of the instrumental
case suffix {r}, or /n/, an allomorph of the locative
case suffix {in}.
     The five pronominal roots are optionally
followed by two position classes of inflectional
suffixes.    The first position class contains six
members:    the object case inflectional suffix
{um}, the pronominal possessive case inflectional
suffix {t}, the instrumental case inflectional
suffix {r}, the locative case inflectional suffix
{in}, the pronominal dual inflectional suffix {*1},
and the pronominal plural inflectional suffix {te}.
The four case suffixes have been described in
Section 3.1.
     The pronominal dual inflectional suffix {*1}
marks dual number.    It has two morphologically
conditioned allomorphs.    It has the shape /1/
when affixed to /pu/, an allomorph of the third
person pronominal root {pi}, or to the third
person proximal pronominal root {9e}j it has the
shape /*1/ elsewhere.    It may he followed by the
pronominal stem formant [e].    It is most
probably reconstructed as an allomorphic shape
of the uninflected dual number morpheme {lei}
noted in Section 5 of this chapter.
     The pronominal plural inflectional suffix
[te] marks plural number.     It has three morph­
ologically conditioned allomorphs.     It has the
shape /te/ when affixed to /ni/, an allomorph
of the first person exclusive pronominal root
{ni}, /mi/, an allomorph of the second person
pronominal root {mi}, /pi/, an allomorph of the
third person pronominal root {pi}.     It has the
shape /le/ when affixed to /ne/, an allomorph
of {ni}, /ma/, an allomorph of {mi}, and the first
person inclusive pronominal root {pe}.       It has
the shape /ba/ when affixed to /pu/, an allomorph
of {pi}, and the third person proximal pronominal
root {9e}.     It may be followed by the pronominal
stem formant {e}.
     The second optional position class of
suffixes affixed to pronominal roots includes two
members:     the emphatic-independent inflectionalsuffix and the pronominal stem formant.
     The emphatic independent inflectional suffix
[o} has both a semantic and a syntactic function.
Semantically it emphasizes the form to which it
is suffixed, while syntactically it marks that
form as not dependent on another form.   It has
a single phonemic shape /o/, and is suffixed
directly to the pronominal root or to the prono­
minal root plus the possessive suffix {r}.     It
does not occur with the first person inclusive
pronominal root (pe} or the third person proximal
pronominal root {9e}.
     The suffix {e }, the pronominal stem formant,
is suffixed to the dual and plural number suffixes,
and is obligatorily followed by either aspect
suffix.   It has two morphologically conditioned
allomorphs: /e/ following /*l/, an allomorph of
the dual number suffix {*1}, /©*/ following /pu/,
an allomorph of the third person pronominal root
{pi} plus /l/, an allomorph of the dual number
suffix {*1}, and the shape /•/ following the
plural number suffix {te}.
     The non-possessed nouns /tun/, /ta•/, /^e/,
/Xome/, /pe/, /ho/, /ke/, /ki/, /qat/, /me/,
and /pur/ may be compounded to the bare pronominal
root, the pronominal root plus members of either
one or both of the two position classes of
suffixes affixed to the root, or to the pronominal
dual and plural forms inflected for aspect and
case.

        4.        Sentence Connectives.   Sentence connectives
    are distinguished primarily in terms of syntactic
    function, but are morphologically marked in two
    ways.    They are all based on the auxiliary verb
    root {‘?uw}, they take a very limited number of
    verbal and nominal suffixes, and are followed by
    post-posed auxiliaries.     Six forms are based on
    the general verb of doing (distal) {’uw}, while
    five are based on a radical derived from this
    root, /^uni/.    To the root (^uw) are suffixed
    the passive {here}, the inevitable future {le},
    the causative {m}.plus the stem formant {a},
    and the particular aspect suffix [t}, while
    to the radical /’uni/ the subordinating suffix
    {r} is affixed, and the auxiliaries {har}, (bUhj,
    and {kil} are post-posed.     The five forms based
    on the radical /’uni/ are totally anomalous in
    morphological composition.     The suffix and the
✓*   three auxiliaries are added to stem I forms of
    verbs, but the vowel /if is an allomorph only
    of the st&m III formant {i}.
                                                           229
     The following sentence connective forms are based
on the auxiliary root {9uw}:
    /*?uwe/     'just that way, anyway'
              implies change in subject 'then,
           so then and yet'
    /^ule*s ?ut/        'if you had       I would have'
     /'hile's *?unir/     'just because they were alike'
    /’uma*/      'thus,' causative (adverbial) for {9u}
    /*?uhetan/       'unless, anyhow, despite, even
           though'
     These sentence connective forms are based on
the radical /^uni/j
     / ‘hini/   quotative (nominalized verb)
     /‘hini-hara*/      'after ... had continued and'
           (when previous predication was a con­
           tinuous state)
     / 9unir/    'because' (that's the way it is)
     / ‘hini-buha/     'and, and then' (sentence
           subject remains the same)
     /9uni-kila/       'if, and, and then* (conditional)     5.          Uninflected words.    The last category of
words, uninflecteds, are fixed in form and are
                                                          230
distinguished by their inability to occur with
inflectional suffixes.      They include four semantic­
ally and syntactically defined classes: conjunctions,
exclamatives, adverbs, directionals and one numeral.
     The conjunctions are*
          /^ut/ ’then, so then, and then' (with
                   sub ject change)
          /qah/ 'or, and or'
          /^elwin/ 'with'
          /kala*n/ ’among’
     The exclamatives are;
         /hada*/ 'wonder
         /hadi/       wonder
         /hi*hi/      a curse
         /ho*/      ’yes’
         /di*h/      ’indeed, hm’
          /ha*haq/     ’look’ (shamanistic )
          /ha\a/ disgust
          /huh/ ’well, all right then’
         /huhlel/      ’all right!’
          /me*kur/     a curse
          /•>ih/    ’oh!’
          /ye*/     ’oh!’
                                            231
     /ma*n/ concessive, indefinite
    /peh/ aw
    /ma*/ oh me I
    /ma»y/ oh me I
     /tah/ surprise
    /sici*/ oh damnl
    /mi-ta/ annoyed surprise
     /‘hune*/ well
     /ye*/ vocative addressive
     /9u*/ I don't know
     /9i*/ a sigh
     /9e*h/ surprise
     /9ay/ ingratiating (weak 'please')
     /9ani*/ regret
     /yo*/ conjectural to self (assured?)
The adverbs are:
    /po*/ now
     /ho*n/ already
    /honda/ long ago, for a long time
     /honbes/ old (of things)
     /hima*/ morrow
     /hima*da/ earlier
     /limon/ away, out of sight, hearing,
                faintly
             /le*n/ ancient
             /le«nda/     yesterday
             /^elewmina/     certainly
             /tuda/     increasingly, further along (from
                     {tu} 'forward' + {da} intensive ?)
     There are ten uninflected words of directional
meaning:
             /way/ north
             /nor/ south
             /nom/ west
             /puy/ east
             /*ol/ up
             /ken/ down
             /9el/ in
             /pan/ on
             /yel/ away             /yay/
These also occur prefixed to roots in verb forms.
The directionals and one other prefix, /xun/ 'toward,
which does not occur as a free form, occur followed
by four suffixes that appear to be locational, but
for which meanings and functions cannot be further
specified.     The four suffixes are;
             {ti} 'at, in'
             {da} 'from'
                                                     233
          {dal} ?
          [el]   'toward, in' with two allomorphs,
                 /e«l/ following [*?ol} and {xun} and {kel}
                 /el/ elsewhere.
    Examples are;
         /yelti/ hack of
         /panti/ top of
         /kenti/ below, under
         / 9elti/ inside
         /wayti/ other side
         /^olti/ above
         /^oltay/ up above (dialect form of /*?olti/?)
         /wayda/ from the north
         /waydal/ outdoors
         /xundal/ from lower
         /norel/ to the south, southward
         /kele»l/ far
         /9ole*l/ up above
         /xune*lti/ on this side
    There is one uninflected numeral, the dual
{lei} which is translated as 'two.'

          Brief Discussion of Syntax
               and Text Analysis
     1.    Syntactic Units.    Most typically the
boundaries of morphological words defined on the basis
of the fixed order of their component morphemes
discussed in Chapter IV, coincide with those of
phonemic words discussed in Chapter II.      The unit
defined by the agreement of phonological and morpho­
logical word boundaries is a full word and constitutes
the basic syntactic unit.      In some instances forms
which are phonemically a single word consist of two
or more morphological words.       These constitute ano­
ther kind of syntactic unit, called a complex word.
The morphological words which occur within the
boundaries of a phonological word contour are classed
as clitics and non-clitics on the basis of dependence.
The clitic is always unilaterally dependent on the
non-clitic; the direction of this dependence being
determined by 'dropping.'      Clitics are classified
as proclitics and postclitics by their position
relative to the non-clitic.      Some morphemic words
occur as both clitics and full words.       For example,
                                                           235
the partial utterance /+qewel+*?el+/ 'in the house1
consists of one phonemic word hut two morphological
words.   The partial utterance /+'?el+oiewel+/ ‘in the
house1 consists of two phonemic words as well as two
morphemic words and hence of two full words.     The
monomorphemic form /vel/ 'in' is ""both a full word
in /H-qewel+^el+Z and a proclitic in /+'?el+qewel+/.
     The largest syntactic unit is the sentence.
Sentences consist of arrangements of full words ter­
minated by a period juncture /./.     These arrangements
of words are of two types depending on the presence
or absence of a word belonging to the morphological
class verb which separates them into clauses and
phrases.
     Clauses which are terminated by a comma junc­
ture /,/ except when occurring sentence finally,
obligatorily contain verbs.    Phrases obligatorily
contain nouns and never main verbs.     Clauses are
of two types;   dependent and independent, according
to the type of inflectional ending forming the verb,
that is, according to whether the verb contained is
dependent or independent.     Independent verbs take
the personal inflectional suffixes, while dependent
verbs are marked by the subordinating suffixes {r},
{■£an|, [9aj, {n }, {so} and {ta}.
                                                            236     Within sentences, the syntactic relations be­
tween full words and between full words and clitics
are indicated by word order and by inflectional and
derivational suffixes as well as by conditions of
dependent occurrence.      Four types of functions are
                                                   I
thereby distinguished:      those of head, attributive,
satellite, and conjunction.
     Heads and attributives are mutually self-defin­
ing, heads being those full words not dependent on
other forms (heads) for their occurrence.       This
dependence is generally marked both by the presence
of certain inflectional morphemes associated with
attributive functions and by the order of the forms
relative to each other.       Thus, attributives of nouns
which are in the locative or genitive case or are
subject pronouns precede the noun heads they modify.
For example:
     /wint^u'n qewelin/ 'in an Indian (Wintu) house'
     /pi kete«t/       'that lone one'
     /po*min !\.uci/     '...fell, stuck in the ground'
     /yay-seden yaythapcus/ 'Coyote's backsplitter'
Generic subject attributives of nouns follow the heads
they modify.   For example:
     /kete»t carawa/ 'one coyote'
                                                      237Attributives(of verbs in the locative case, i.e.,
words in the locative case and noun phrases with heads
in the locative case, precede the verb they modify.
For example:
     /wint^U'n qewelin buha/    'in an Indian house
          he did live'
     /9ewin biya/    'here be ...'
     /qolci-n norel phuta»/    'It's boiling up in
          the sky heading south'
     /^e^lin kuda/    'step all over'
Attributives of verbs in the genitive case follow the
verb they modify.    For example:
     /qolca ^ol-kulun/ 'the sky being on edge'
     Satellites, which only occur in clauses and
include words, phrases, or dependent clauses, are
either the subject or object of verbs.    This relation
is marked by both word order and concord of the
nominal inflectional case suffixes {urn}, junj and
{in}, or the particular aspect suffix {t} or the
generic aspect suffix {s} (which when unmarked for
case function as subjects) with the verb stem II
deriving suffixes:{t} (which marks the verb as
having a subject in the particular aspect),   {i*l}
(which marks the verb as having an object in the
particular aspect) and {m} (which marks the verb.as
                                                                                          238

                Phonology
    1.        Suprasegmental Phonemes.   The supra-
segmental features of stress, pitch, and pause
form contours which will he used hs the distri­
butional frame for the establishment of the
segmental phonemes.   The junctural pauses or
transitions and phrasal pitch are phonemic in
status, i.e., unpredictable and marking mean­
ing distinctions, while syllable stress and
pitch are predictable partial components of
the two junctures /-/ and /+/•   T^e phonetic
data allow of only one interpretation.   That
is, junctural transitions and pauses would not
be predictable if phonemic stress or phonemically
prominent syllables were assumed, while stress
is predictable in terms of phonemic juncture.
     1.1.       Junctures.   There are four phonemic
junctures: plus /+/» hyphen /-/, comma /,/, and
period /./•   They are ranked by the magnitude of their
phonological transition and their morphological and
syntactic function from least to greatest magnitude
respectively as; /-/, /+/» /,/, /./.
     Plus juncture consists of potential pause and
the conditioning of three phonetic features: the
location of higher pitch, the location of relatively
heavy, i.e., primary, stress which phonetically
consists of both tenseness and loudness, and the
allophonic release of immediately preceeding
obstruents.   The contour boundaries marked by /+/
delimit sequences of phonation which will be called
phonemic words.    These are coterminous with the
freely volunteered short forms elicited from informants
which may be referred to as informant words.     Each
phonemic word, then, is preceeded and followed by
pause or potential pause and consists of one contour
with only one prominent syllable of higher pitch and
primary stress.
     The location of the pitch and stress within the
phonemic word bounded by /+/ is determined by the
structure of the syllable and its position relative
to the juncture.    Syllables are of three structural
grades, determined by the presence or absence of
length and semi-vowels.    Light syllables contain
short vowels not followed by a semi-vowel.     Heavy
syllables contain short vowels followed by a semi­
vowel (which may be a member of the next syllable);
                                                                   41
extra heavy syllables contain long vowels.        The
prominent syllable of a phonemic word is always the
first syllable following the juncture unless the
second syllable is heavier in which case the second
syllable is stressed.     When a hyphen juncture inter­
venes between any two plus junctures, the prominent
syllable is determined beginning from the position
of the hyphen juncture rather than that of the
first plus juncture.     A secondary pattern of stress
and pitch is conditioned between the initial plus
juncture and the hyphen juncture which is described
in the discussion of hyphen juncture.
                                                        i
     Examples are;
          [ciyel]     /+ciyel+/       'one to be squashed'
          [ciyi*ya]     /+ciyi*ya+/      'to be all squashed up'
          [ciy£*da]     /+ciye»da+/      'I squashed them up'
     The degree of intensity in the primary
stress of the single prominent syllable in
each word is dependent on two environmental
factors.    The greater the preceding juncture,
the greater the intensity of the stress; the
more fortis the glottalization of a preceding
consonant or the articulation of a preceding
/V, ""the stronger the stress.    The latter
factor of glottal stricture varies with the
ideolect but appears consistent within each
ideolect.
     A weaker, or secondary stress, occurs on
any heavy syllable following the prominent
syllable and varies in intensity, being pro­
portionately stronger as that syllable is
further from the preceding prominent syllable.
     The weakest degree of stress occurs on any
syllable which is not already stressed and im­
mediately follows a phonemic juncture.    The
variation in this degree of stress has a small
range parallel to that described above for pri-
mary stress with respect to junctural magnitude
and glottal articulation.
     Examples of the various distributions of
stress and pitch within a phonemic word are given
below.     ['] indicates the prominent syllable of
higher pitch and greater stress, ['] the syllable
with secondary stress, E! an extra heavy syllable,
S a heavy syllable, and s a light syllable.

     sSS     [9ol6*lb&*s]     /+*?ole*lbe»s+/        'God'     Hyphen juncture /-/ represents a phonemically
functional unit with phonetic properties contrast­
ive with other junctures.      Phonetically it is a
transition with the potential of a very brief pause
and conditions unreleased allophones of obstruents.
Like plus juncture, hyphen juncture affects the lo­
cation of syllables of higher pitch and stress.
But whereas plus juncture marks the contour of a
phonemic word, conditioning the location of the
syllables of greater stress and pitch, hyphen junc­
ture modifies the contour, shifting the pitch and
stress.    Hyphen juncture is limited in distribution
to occurrence within phonemic words.       It is therefore
the juncture of least magnitude, being the only
one occurring within words (specifically follow­
ing a few prefixes and within a few compounds).
     Examples of minimal pairs demonstrating the
contrast between close transition, hyphen juncture
and plus juncture are:
     /+*?elwine+/           'with, along, accompanying'
     /+*?el-wine+/          'to look at straight in the
                        eye'
    /+ma»tceki+/       'ear wax'
    /+ma*t-ceki+/      'one split ear'
    Z+'hikin-su* s+/   'they belong to that tribe'
    /+‘hikin+su*s+/    'they were standing there'
    /+ne»l-be*s+/      'we are related through the
                        same mother'
    /+ne*l+be•s+/      'we two slept'     The rules stated above for predicting the
occurrence of pitch and stress in terms of plus
juncture are modified by the occurrence of hyphen
juncture within a phonemic word.    Only secondary
stress may occur on syllables preceding /-/
within a word,   like primary stress, this
secondary stress always occurs on the initial
syllable of the word unless the second syllable
is heavier, in which case the second syllable
has the secondary stress.
     Examples of the various distributions of
stress and pitch within phonemic words contain­
ing a hyphen juncture are given below, using the
same symbolization employed in the discussion of
plus juncture.                        [n£tn£n]     /+net-nen+/          'my mother'

                                             'of those others'        Comma juncture /,/ has two phonetic features:
a fully realized pause accompanied by glottal stric­
ture.           While plus juncture is of greater magnitude
than hyphen juncture and marks phonemic words, the
contour boundaries marked by comma juncture delimit
sequences of phonation called phonemic phrases,
within each of which obligatorily occurs one phrasal
accent of unpredictable location. (See 1.2)
        Period juncture /./, the juncture of greatest
magnitude, has four phonetic features: a fully-
realized pause which need not be followed by
further phonation, an associated glottal stricture,
a preceding phrasal accent of unpredictable location
with allophonically different pitch level from that
of the accent preceding comma juncture, and a terminal
pitch contour which drops sharply in pitch level and
voicing.    Period juncture delimits phonemic sentences.
     Examples of comma and period juncture are;
     /ba*s-bo*sin+net, nis+Xiya.,/    'They threw rocks
     at me because I was eating'
     /ba•s-bo•sin+mat, mis+Xiya./     'They threw rocks
     at you because you were eating'     1.2.    Phrasal Accent.   Phrasal accent /'/»
consisting of very high pitch and particularly heavy
stress, occurs on one of the prominent syllables
within each contour marked by /,/ or /./.     Its
occurrence is obligatory within such contours but
its position of occurrence is unpredictable.
It is further characterized by a
                                                    48
different pitch level on the syllables which fol­
low, depending on whetner the following juncture
is /,/ or /./.   If pitch [3] is high, pitch [2 ]
mid, and pitch [l] low, the syllables preceding
the accented syllable are marked by pitch [2],
the accented prominent syllable by pitch [3],
and the following syllables by pitch [2 ] before
/,/ and pitch [l] before /./.
     Examples ares
     /sukuyum+limcada./      'My dog is sick'
     /sTikuyum+limcada./     'My dog is sick'
     2.      Segmental Phonemes, There are 33 segmentals,
of which 27 are consonants, 5 are vowels, and 1 is
vowel length (a prosodic feature distinguished from
the suprasegments),   In addition there are 4 ano­
malous phonemes which are of very rare occurrence!
3 consonants and 1 vowel.    Of the consonants /f/
and /J/ were recently borrowed, and /©/ occurs only
in the ideolect of C,- D,, my main informant, and is
elsewhere represented by /X/.   The vowel /ae/ occurs
in only one loan word,
     2,1,      Consonants,    Two types of consonants are
distinguished by distributions those of unrestricted
and those of restricted occurrence.   All the restricted
consonants are limited to syllable initial pre-vocalic
position, except /r/ which is excluded from word-
initial position, i.e. never occurs after any
juncture, and /©/ which never occurs initially in
a syllable or word; both /r/ and /©/ may occur
prejuncturally, i.e. in word final position^unlike
the other restricted consonants.

     In the bilabial and dental-alveolar positions of
articulation there is a four-way contrast in the manner
of articulating the stops: glottalized, aspirated,
voiced, and plain (unaspirated)#     Bilabials:
/p/     voiceless, unaspirated, always lenis.
/ph/    voiceless aspirated, usually fortis.
/p/     glottalized, fortis among some younger in­
        formants and in citation forms, but lenis
        in normal speech.
/b/     voiced and fortis.
       In the dental position of articulation younger
and more acculturated informants employ alveolar
stop articulation as in English, while older informants
seem to prefer a post-dental position, or a position
on the gums when the teeth have been lost.        These
apical alveolars are:
/t/     voiceless unaspirated, always lenis.
  V.
/t /    voiceless aspirated, usually fortis.
/■£/    glottalized, as for /p/
/d/     voiced and fortis.
       In the velar and postvelar positions of articu­
lation there is only a two-way contrast in the manner
of articulation of stops: glottalized, and non-
glottalized (voiceless).
/&/     glottalized, usually    lenis, with slightfriction
         of tongue on palate.    There arethree focal     alio-
 phones along a continuum of points of arti­
 culation: [£]
            /> pre-velar before /i/ and /e/,
 [&] velar before /a/, and [£] baoked somewhat
 in the velar position before /u/ and /o/;
 the last allophone overlaps with the front
 allophone of /q/ before /i/ and /e/ in the
 speech styles of some informants, but only
 in point of articulation (see below).
 voiceless, most often slightly aspirated,
 usually lenis; varies similarly from Ik*1]
 prevelar.... [k*1] velar.... [fc*1] backed,
 before /i, e/, /a/, and /u, o/ respectively,
 glottalized, usually fortis, with a strongly
  spirantalized release and much friction at
 the points of articulation as [q*]; varies
  in position of articulation from a slightly
  fronted position before /i/ and /e/ to a more
  backed position before other vowels,
 voiceless, usually lenis, most often unaspirated
  but in rare instances slightly aspirated;
  similarly to /q/ varies in position from
  [q] to [q] before /a/, /o/, and /u/.
Of the above stop consonants only /p/, /t/,
and /q/ occur syllable finally as well as
initially, and they all share the following features of
syllable-final position allophony:
     Before /,/ or /./ they are all closely followed
by a slight glottal stricture and an audible release
after the occlusion of the appropriate stop.     This is
no identical with the articulation of the glottalized
series of stop phonemes in which the occlusion is
generally less tense and the glottalization is a
coarticulated and non-delayed feature.     The allophones
of /k/ and /q/ in this position exhibit none of the
friction which is present in the glottalized series,
but resemble the non-glt>ttalized stops.    The audible
glottal stricture following closure of the stop is
here (as after /m/, / n / , /l/, /w/, and /y/j see
below) interpreted as one of the phonetic components
of the junctures /,/ and /./.
     Before /+/ these four stops all show an aspirated
release which is not fortis as in the oase of the
aspirated stop phonemes (which occur only initially),
but which is so lenis as to constitute usually no more
than an audible release in rapid speech and a lenis
aspiration in citation forms.    The aspiration is
interpreted as one of the phonetic components of
the juncture /+/•
     Before /-/ and before close transition, all 6f
these stops are unaspirated and usually unreleased,
resembling their syllable-initial allophones, except
/k/ which is weakly aspirated in initial position.
     A glottal stop / 9/> which has an audible release
before /,/ and /./ and is of unrestricted occurrence,
is weakly articulated except when the speaker is being
deliberate or emphatic.   This phoneme is in free
variation with zero in initial position and in medial
position in rapid speech, but is always fully
articulated pre-juncturally.   (Note also that the
glottalized phonemes are normally articulated in a
lax manner, particularly when they are not post-
Junatural, although some slight glottal coarticulation
is never absent, and the acoustic quality of these
stops is often quite similar to that of voiceless
unaspirated stops.   Only in some ideolects or in
emphatic speech is fortis glottalization employed;
this is somewhat parallel to the glottal stop
initially.)
     All stop phonemes which occur syllable-finally
before other consonants in word-medial two-consonant
clusters (the only consonant clusters which exist)
are unreleased and are assigned to the voiceless
plain series of unrestricted stops.","[44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61]"

                      INTRODUCTION
     Wintu is a nearly extinct language spoken in
northern California in Shasta and Trinity Counties.
It is a member of a family of three languages estab­
lished by the Powell classification of 1877 and des­
ignated the Copehan family.     In the recent literature
this family has been called Wintun, but has also been
known as Copeh (Latham 1856), Wintoon (Gatschet 1877),
Wintun (Dixon and Kroeber 1913), Wintuan (Swadesh 1956).
The northernmost language of this family, here referred
to as Wintu, has also been referred to as Northern
Wintun (Kroeber), Wintu• ‘ (Lee ), Wintuic (Lamb), and
Wintun (Curtin), as well as by the names for some of
the dialects: McCloud River, Trinity County, Shasta
County, Upper Sacramento, Baldhill, Hayfork, Keswick,
Stillwater, and French Gulch.     This language was speci­
fically called Digger by Gatschet in 1876; although the
term has been applied to very many California Indian
groups, Gatschet referred to a group of Indians in
Colorado who were Wintu or some mixture of Wintun.
     Wintu is closely related to Nomlaki and less closely
to Patwin, the other members of the Wintun family.       Wintun
in turn is one of the California Penutian languages,
clearly though distantly related to the Yokuts, Miwok,
Maidu, and Costanoan families.
     Previous linguistic research on Wintu (except for
some unpublished word lists) has been carried on by
Dorothy Demetracopoulou Lee (unpublished) and Poland B.
Dixon (1909).    See the accompanying bibliography for
(a) synchronic linguistic descriptions and word-lists,
(b) comparative and historical linguistic materials and
classifications, and (c) ethnological and archaeological
materials.
     The Wintu language survives in only the McCloud
River and Trinity County dialects.   The former is still
spoken by about two dozen people and the latter by only
a handful of older persons.   My principal informants were
all speakers of the McCloud River dialect.    The basic
field work occupied the summers of 1956 and 1957, with
additional shorter periods for checking forms during
1958 and 1959.   My three principal informants
were, in the order of their importance:
     Carrie B. Dixon of Redding, seventy years
        old, granddaughter of the last McCloud
        Chief ( Qolculu'li ).
     Ellen Silverthorn of the Clear Creek Rancheria
        south of Redding, over eighty years old,
        a former shaman-interpreter, monolingual,
     Joe Charles of Buckeye north of Redding, over
        eighty years old, a former shaman.
Other informants consulted were:
     Flora Jones of Buckeye, herbalist-shaman,
        niece of Joe Charles.
     Renee Coleman of Redding.
     Nels Sisson, shaman, Ellen Silverthorn's
        brother, deceased 1957*
     lizzie Feder of Lakehead, over seventy years
        old.
     Walter loomls of Weaverville, over seventy-
        five years old, Trinity dialect,
     Grace Nolton McRibbon of Hayfork, over
        seventy years old, Trinity dialect.
     lizzie Cortez of Redding.
     Bill Reed of Frojeot City.
     Johnny Stacey, over eighty years old.
     Edna Button-Benner-Raines-Fan, over seventy
        years old*
     Mary Major, about 100 years old, of Oovelo.
     My field work was generously supported by the
Survey of California Indian Languages, Department of
Linguistics, University of California, Berkeley.       In
1958-1959 I had an additional grant from the Wenner-Gren
Foundation to support a dialect survey and an investi­
gation of related languages.   Of the many people who
have contributed to the preparation of this work, fore­
most is Professor Mary R. Haas, who has guided and
encouraged me from the beginning and whose patient and
unflagging support has made this grammar possible.
My thanks also go to Professor Murray B. Bmeneau for
reading and commenting on a draft of this grammar, and
for his kind and warm encouragement.    Thanks are also
due Professors David Reed and Douglas C. Chretien for
their patience and kindness in reading and commenting
on a draft of this grammar.
     Without the unpublished texts and field notes so
generously loaned by Professor Dorothy Deraetracopoulou
Lee, this description of Wintu would have been far less
extensive.   The texts in particular made it possible to
re-elicit oral literature which for the most part has
disappeared in the last thirty years.   The Lee materials
have added two dimensions to this description.     A
quarter century time span is encompassed making it
possible to describe features which are now exceedingly
difficult if not impossible to collect, while a variety
of ideolects and styles have thus been included,
broadening the synchronic scope.
     My very special thanks are due Carrie 3. Dixon,
a superb informant and teacher, who worked unstintingly
and generously to place the Wintu language before me.

    /f/      [f]labio-dental; anomalous; occurs in
             only two forms: /forijulay/ 'July Fourth'
             and /friho«lis/ 'beans' (the only example
             of a non-medial consonant cluster).
    /0/      [0] interdental after /i/; after /u/ and
             /o/ the tongue proceeds from a retroflex-
             ed position moving forward in an approach
             to the teeth as the articulation pro­
             gresses: [^0].   /©/ occurs only word-
             finally, is of rare frequency, is used
             only by my main informant, and while it
             contrasts with /\/ in her dialect, all
             other informants employ the phonetically
             similar /X/.
     /s/     older speakers employ [§], a retroflexed
             postalveolar slit spirant, before or after
             /a/, /o/, and /u/ and a non-retroflexed post-
                                                                 59        alveolar slit spirant elsewhere.    Younger
        speakers use the latter sibilant or an
        apical-alveolar everywhere.
/\/     an apical-alveolar laterally-released [l],
        freely varying initially with [t£] ([*]), an
        apical-alveolar affricate with a lateral
        release.   These two syllable-initial allophones
        occur in McCloud speech although [l] is much
        more frequent.    In Trinity speech only the affricate
        [fc] occurs.   In both dialects in final position
        after /u/ and /o/ (similarly to /©/) the tongue
        moves from a retroflexed position forward to
                                 Tp
        approach the teeth as [-l].     In both dialects
        in syllable-final position the points of
        articulation are post-dental after /a/ and inter­
        dental after /i/ and /e/.
/x/     has allophones varying in position from [x]....
        [x]....[x] in a distribution identical to the
        velar stops.     Lenis articulation of /x/ is
        characteristic.
/-$./   has allophones varying in position of articulation
        identical to the post-velar stops, and
        consequently has some allophones which overlap
        those of /x/ so that /$/ before /i/ and /e/
        overlaps with /x/ before /u/ and /o/.     However
      /$/ is more fortis in articulation than
      /x/.
/h/   voiceless and fortis, occurs in all posi­
      tions, is distinct from /x/ and /$/ which
      have friction, and from /?/ which is voiced
      and not fortis.    Before /u/, /o/, and /a/
      it is a glottal spirant.     Before /i/ and /e/
      it is a pre-velar spirant with minimum
      friction.     1^ syllable-final position it is
      a voiceless non-vocalic offglide with the
      same position of articulation as the preced­
      ing vowel, and is relatively fortis in cita­
      tion forms.

in minimal and subminimal pairs are given below,
