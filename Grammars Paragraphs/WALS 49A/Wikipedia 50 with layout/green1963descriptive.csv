     In considering the secondary grammatical categories such as person, number, gender, case
it is important to remember that they will be differently expressed*) and will have a different
scope*) in different languages, if indeed they are present at all. To labour this would be to
flog a dead horse.
   Gender does not appear to be grammatically expressed in Igbo.
   Person and number are grammatically expressed only by pronoun sequence, so far as
we can see.

place across the boundaries of multiclausal sentences. See infra, p. 176.

176                                      Green/Izwe, Grammar of Igbo  In the three following sentences, for instance, the pronoun in the second clause varies ac-
cording to the pronouns in the first clause, and in so doing is expressing both person and
number’):
     Mu na yd garda ahya;’anyi           adzuo anu   “He and I   (lit.   1 and he) went to market; we
        ne az                                        bought meat and fish”
        GH nit yd gard ahya; unit dzuo anu na        “You (sing.) and he went to market: you (pl.)
        azn                                          bought meat and fish”
           Ya na nwanné yd gara ahya;’ha dzuo        “He and his brother went to market;           they
        anu na azh                                   bought   meat   and   fish”
  In the two following sentences, where the sequence is pronoun to noun, the choice of pro-
noun again expresses both person and number.
        Ot midhi byara n'ulo m: ‘ya agwa im          ‘One person came to my house; he told me
        na o hirh aghu                               he had seen a leopard”
        Madhi até bydra wuld m; ""ha agwa mh          “Three people came to my house; they told
        ni ha& hire aghy                             me they had seen a leopard”
   Case brings us to a much more complex question. If, in this category, we include such
traditional European linguistic facts as the relations of nominals to verbs as subject or object,
or to each other as genitives, or to prepositions, we find such relations expressed in Igbo by
word order and          tone, but with many ramifications unknown to such a language as English
or Latin.
   Not only, for instance, is genitival relationship of a noun to another noun expressed by
post-position and by a special tone pattern in the genitival noun.           It is also expressed by a
particular inflexional tone pattern in the pre-genitival noun. What, in fact, is required is a
particular tonal relationship and this is achieved, sometimes by a change in the inherent
tone of one noun, sometimes of the other, sometimes of both. Tone, in Igbo, stresses the fact
that in any relationship at least two relata are involved. This fact tends to be obscured by a
linguistic terminology which, as in Latin, speaks of a noun as being in the genitive case. In
Igbo a noun is genitive not only in virtue of its own behaviour but of that of the pre-genitival
noun. For example, if the nouns odh% “tail” and oke “rat” are in genitival relationship, both
have non-inherent tones, od/hi dke “the rat’s tail”. Moreover a noun may, both by word order
and by tone, mark its relationship to what follows and to what precedes. In the following
sentence the noun madhu “person” has non-inherent tones both in relation to the preceding
noun, to which it is in genitival relationship, and to the following verb, to which it is in
subject relationship. Ndi kore akuko @ st wu ukpa madhi di iché iché. “Those who told these
stories were types of people of various kinds” (Text V, 1. 28).
   What might be called this fore and aft system of grammatical relations expressed by tone
is typical of Igbo. Tone relates each part of speech to that which precedes and that which
follows it within the clause.
   As for the relations between nominals and verbs, we have seen in the verb chapters that
not only is subject and object relationship expressed but it is differently expressed, tonally,
for different verb forms. Moreover it is not only tonally expressed in the noun. The low, or
high falling to low, tone required on the syllable immediately preceding a Subject Verb
Form I, main, verb form may fall on the last syllable of the noun subject. But if that noun is
      ') It should be noted that the expression of these categories by pronoun sequence may, at times,
transcend sentence boundaries. To this extent, therefore, grammatical relations may exist even between
multiclausal sentences, which thus cannot be considered, in this respect, as Dr. Haas considers them,
as ‘‘the most inclusive units of Linguistic Analysis proper’. See W. Haas, op. eit., p. 61. But possibly
the operative    word   is *‘proper’’.
       P                                                                            va
                   Chapter XXIII.   The Part Played by Tone in Igho Grammar                       177qualified by a relative verb form this tone will fall on the last syllable of the verb. Thus we get
Ahyé firt uka “The market caused a dispute”. But we also get Ahya o ld! fara uka “His not
leaving the market (lit. the market he did not leave) caused trouble”. There is also tonal
interaction between verb form and noun object in which the tone of verb as well as noun is
involved, for instance in the unsuffixed imperative and Subject Verb Form IT, main,               un-
suffixed, of a low tone verb. Again, what is required here is a tonal relationship.
  With facts like these it is difficult to exclude the verb from expressing the category of case.
But as far as terminology    is concerned    we have not spoken   of case, even   for nominals,   but
have spoken rather of relations, in our descriptions of grammatical        behavior. This is in no
way to deny that the eategory of case is present. Rather it is to draw attention to the way in
which this category is expressed in Igbo grammar.","[195, 196, 197]"

                           The Part Played by Tone in Igbo Grammar
   The part played by grammatical, as distinct from lexical, tone in Igbo was little under-
stood before the work on this subject by Ida Ward.') Nor has the expression of gramma-
tical relations by tone yet received much attention in general linguistices. It is therefore,
perhaps,   worth   while, without attempting      a summary     of the present study, to consider
one or two points about the role of tone in Igbo grammar.
  Except for the inflexional verbal prefix, grammatical relations are, as we have seen, ex-
pressed by word order and by tone. With a fixed word order, allowing of little deviation,
has tone a real part to play or is it merely an “extra’’, a frill that could be omitted
without being much missed? This is, of course, an improper question. It is not for the
student of language to decide which of the means of expression any particular language could
dispense with. It is for him to accept them as they stand and to try to understand the part
they play. And to an Igho speaker tone isas much a part of the linguistic apparatus as are
phonemes or any other of its means of expression. It is the European who is struck by its un-
familiarity. But it is none the less legitimate, while accepting tone as an essential part of Igbo
grammar, to ask whether or not there are times when it expresses grammatical relations
which, in terms of word order, would be ambiguous. The answer is, of course, that it does.
And the fact that the context also helps is neither more nor less relevant here than in any
other linguistic situation.
   We have noted, for instance, how the tonal behaviour of a noun object may help to
distinguish two different verb forms otherwise liable to be confused. There is also the obvious
case of a verb form followed by two nouns which, according to the word order, might be
either a first and second object or a pair of nouns in genitival relationship. Thus with the
same tone classes of noun we have:
     O nyere Adha okuko             “He gave Adha a hen’’           Two noun objects
     O nyere akhwa okuko            “He gave hen’s eggs”            Two nouns in genitival
                                                                    relationship

 178                                       Green/Igwe,    Grammar of Igbo    More complicated examples of identical word order but grammatical differentiation by
 tone can be seen in the following pair of sentences, where no distinction of lexical tone
 comes in.
        O hida ozu éke nwiru       n'ulo                  “He has found the corpse of the rat which
                                                         died in the house”
        O taala akhu Adha 20r6 n’°uld                    “He has eaten the nuts Adha hid in the house”’   In the first, the nouns oZu dke are in genitival relationship followed by Subject Verb
 Form I, sub., rel. A. In the second, Adha is not a genitive but the subject of Subject Verb
 Form    I, sub., rel. B, in a clause which qualifies akhw. In each case N hh ou, akhu is followed
 by N lh, dke, Adha.
   In the following sentence not only word order and lexical tone but words are identical.
 Grammatical differentiation is by tone and by a slight pausal factor, which occurs after
 ohya in the first version and after aghw in the second.
       Onye pyoro ohya ‘aghu na acu ya oso               “Anyone who roams        about    in     the   bush,     a
                                                         leopard chases him”
       Onye pyoro ohya aghh na acu ya oso                ‘‘Anyone who roams about in bush where there
                                                         is a leopard makes him run (i. e. startles him)”
   Tone is, in fact, a sensitive barom®ter of grammatical change, or rather, a sensitive instru-
 ment. And in Igbo the relations of each part of speech to that which precedes and follows it
is expressed, either actually or potentially1), by tone, in addition to, or independently                       of,
word order.
  We have set out, in the preceding chapters, many of the systems of tone change that are
found in the language. But it must be remembered that any rule formulated for tonal
behaviour only holds good “‘all things being equal”. To say this is not to invalidate the rule.
It is, rather, to say that if something is, for instance, added to an utterance of which the
grammatical relations and their expression by tone have been described, there may be a
change in the tone patterns even though the original grammatical relations remain unaltered.
We say, for example, that after Subject Verb Form II, main, noun objects of tone group I
retain their inherent tones. Example:           O zvola dla “He has bought some land”.              But if we
follow al& by N lh in genitival relationship we shall get: O zola ala Adha, or, 0 ztola ala
Adha. “He has bought Adha’s land”. The grammatical relations of the first example have not
changed. Ald is still the object of the verb. But it is now expressing tonally its pre-genitival
relationship to Adha, which itself has mid level tones.
   This sensitivity of tone to every kind of grammatical relation, and not only to that of
dependence*), is of special interest to structural linguistics, with its focus on the relations
between units. “Ferdinand de Saussure may in many respects be considered the founder of
the modern science of language. He too was the first to call for a structural approach to
language, i. e. a scientific description of language in terms of relations between units’). In
a tone language like Igbo a linguistic unit cannot be seized on or described except in some
relation. The lexical tones may be said to express relations of detachement. No doubt this
is also true where relations are expressed by word order. But it is not so manifest.","[197, 198]"

  They are numbered in two levels*) to indicate the vowel harmony which is such a marked
characteristic of the language. Although harmony of position occurs in the case of the open
vowel suffix,) where a front vowel is followed by an open front vowel of the same level and
a back vowel by an equivalent open back vowel, it is the harmony of levels that is general.
Vowels of the two different levels, I and 2, do not occur in the same word except in the case
of compound verbs or of verbs with certain suffixes’), or of borrowed words.
  Derivational and inflexional prefixes always observe vowel harmony of levels. With the
verb stem ia, for instance, there is an inflexional prefix a-, as in Atala! “Don’t eat (munch)!”’
When this same radical element is used as a noun base there is a derivational prefix o-,as in
ota “the eater’’, and g#t- as in dtita “the eating’. It will be seen that all the vowels come from
level 2, either front or back. This is the kind of behaviour that is meant when we speak of
Igbo vowel harmony’).

     Many farmers get discouraged when they think that they have not got enough money for
poultry farming on modern lines. One new method is to use an incubator.
   What one must tell people like this is to cheer up and stop worrying. A little good sense is
the important thing in farming. It is always said that farmers are known to be more sensible
than other people.
     Anyone who wants to keep chickens should see to it, in the first place, that he begins on
the right lines. To begin on the right lines does not consist in keeping more fowls than one’s
other farmer friends. What it means is to be sure that one has good chickens, whether one
or two, at the outset.
     Start by seeing the people who work in the Agricultural Department,      so that they can
advise you about how to begin. They will help you to get good cocks and hens without wasting
a lot of money on them. If you ask them, they can come, too, and keep an eye on them for
you.
     If I were a farmer, what I should start with would     be one cock and six hens,   which I
should look after and tend carefully so that they would produce many healthy chicks in a short
time. Regular feeding is a thing that is very good for them. A place should be made where
they can feed without jumping into it and carrying dirt in with their feet. If they are given
no variety in their food their health will suffer.
  A successful poultry breeder will be one who has the sense to ask questions of professional
breeders and to find out their good methods.

                                         PARTI     THE   SYSTEM
                                               Chapter LV                    The Linguistie Units of the Grammar            in Ascending   Order
   In our description of the system of the grammar of Igbo we proceed from the smallest unit,
the morpheme, to the largest unit, the multiclausal sentence,!) taking always the total
utterance,   or sentence,   as our essential    linguistic datum.
   Smaller units than sentences are found as complete utterances of a linked type. Like the
sentence they are post- and pre-pausal, and a sentence would be substitutable. The smallest
unit found as a complete utterance is a word,?) the largest is a multiclausal sentence. No unit
of a lower level, that is to say of the morpheme          level,   is substitutable for the   words   in an
utterance. Together with the words are found units of the same level, such as conjunctions
and prepositions, which do not occur as complete utterances but for which, none the less.
no unit of a lower level is substitutable. These, together with the word classes, we call the
parts of speech.
  A complete utterance may, as has been said, consist of one word. Such words will include
exclamations and linked utterances of the question and answer type. Or the complete ut-
terance may consist of a group of words, a phrase, used in the same way. If the group of
words contains a verb form we call it a clause. A clause may be a complete utterance of the
linked type for which a single word is formally substitutable. Or it may be found within a
multiclausal sentence as an incomplete utterance for which, again, a single word or part of
speech is substitutable. We then call it a clause of incomplete utterance. But a clause which
is a complete unlinked type of utterance, for which no single word is formally substitutable,
we call a clause of complete utterance.*) In Part I, where a text is analysed in units of
descending order, many clauses of this kind will be described by analytic definition as con-
stituents of the more complex unit of the multiclausal sentence. Once formally identified in
this manner it will be seen that they can also occur as isolated complete utterances.
  If an utterance contains more than one verb form it contains more than one clause. Any
one clause contains only one verb form. A clause, however, is characterised, not only by the
presence of a verb form but by the fact that the grammatical relations of the parts of speech
hold within the clause and are actually or potentially exhausted therein. If a new clause     1) Sineo the morphome is the smallest grammatical unit it can only be given synthetic, and not ana-
lytic, definition in a grammatical description.

will merely be a repetion of the old. The parts of speech, in fact, have intraclausal relations.’)

selves.*)
                                                    Chapter V                   The Parts of Speech and Their Minimal            Distinetive Characteristics
      Since the morphemes       are the lowest level of linguistic units in the grammatical               system
they can only be described in relation to the higher, more complex, units of which they are
the constituents, that is to say, in relation to the parts of speech. We shall therefore proceed
direct to the parts of speech, which will be described not only in relation to the higher levels,
the more complex units, of which they are the constituents, but also in relation to the lower
level of morphemes, which are their constituents and which are themselves thus described.
      The parts of speech are described in the following chapters, but their minimal differential
criteria,    the   minimum     of characteristics      that    distinguish   them   from   each   other, can   be
very briefly set, out first.
   Verbs are distinguished from all other parts of speech in being the only one with which
an inflexional affix is found. This affix is a vowel prefix. This is the only instance of inflexion
phonologically, or segmentally, expressed. All other inflexion in the verb and all inflexion in
the other parts of speech, is tonally, or suprasegmentally, expressed. *)
      Nominals      — nouns, pronouns, numerals                  — are distinguished by a wide range of
syntactical behaviour, much of which is common                   to them, and by much tonal inflexion.*)
          Nouns are minimally distinguished from pronouns by the fact that in a linked ut-
        terance of the question type not initiated by an interrogative, the subject of the verb must
        be a pronoun, or a pronoun following a noun in apposition. It cannot be a noun alone.
          Numerals are distinguished from pronouns in the same way, and from nouns by a
        special tonal inflexion in genitival       relationship.
      Interrogatives are minimally distinguished from nominals by the fact that they can
constitute or initiate a linked utterance of the question type without a pronoun as subject
of the verb.
   Adjectives, conjunctions?) and the preposition are distinguished from the foregoing
parts of speech by a restricted syntactical behaviour and by the fact that they are not found
in isolation as complete utterances.
        Adjectives are never initial in an utterance. They are only found immediately following
        a nominal or other adjective and in their relation to these they have no tonal inflexion such
        as would be found in a nominal qualifying, in genitival relationship, a preceding nominal.","[29, 30, 31, 32]"

     1) Relative B is also found after conjunctions.
                         Chapter XXII,    The Secondary Grammatical Categories                                175     Sentence with two complete utterance clauses joined by a conjunction
       O dight thye driri fooro any n’uld (ma)          “There is no food left for us in the house but I
       ah mr exiight m oke iga ihye 6 wile              am not well enough       to go anywhere           today’’
       tha &@                                           (Text LI, sent. 8)
  The conjunction may be bracketed here to show that it is not an essential part of the formal
construction of either clause. Each clause is complete without it. Contrast with this the
sentence Hd dnaghi ekwe ka ezi di byara ya “They do not agree that an eligible suitor should
approach her” (Text I, sent. 5). Here ka is an essential formal element of the clause it intro-
duces — in this case a noun (object) clause. Or take the sentence Ka mu dbyani ka anyi
rie ya ma mM gawa ahya ygwa pgwa “Let me come and let us eat it so that I may go to market
quickly” (Text IT, sent. 20). Here all the conjunctions — the two ka and the ma —are essential]
formal parts of the clauses they introduce. In a sentence such as ] makwaard n@ ji ighu a na
adha oh nwokhd na oh nwaany?? “Do you know, too, that yam is the price of a man slave
and    a woman    slave?”   (Text   IT, sent. 34), it is not elear, at first sight, whether       or not nd is
formally essential to the clause it introduces. The clause could stand without it as a complete
utterance. It has a main verb form. But it would then no longer stand in object relationship
to    ] makwdara as it does at present.       In clauses of this kind,     therefore,   which   include     cases
of indirect speech, nd is best considered as part of the clause it introduces, as was ka in the
sentence quoted above, Ma dnaght ékwe ka ezi di byara ya. Compare with this, Text I, sent. 15,
where na joins two clauses, each of which is a complete utterance without it, as is the case
with the first example diseussed here, Text II, sent. 8, with the conjunction md.
   The identification of clauses is a complicated matter which is only possible in the light of
a detailed examination of the grammatical structure of Igbo. We hope that the analysis of
a whole text in Part I will be of value to the reader in this matter.
   Multiclausal sentences, the higher, more complex unit within which clauses are given their
synthetic definition, are not themselves susceptible of such definition since they are the
highest, most complex, linguistic unit we have?). They can only be given analytic definition
in terms of their constituents, the clauses, which have already been described.","[194, 195]"
"   1) With Mr. J. O. Iroaganachi and Mr. 8. Chianakwalam, both of whom I would like to thank. The
former has also given me much help independently and I am grateful to him for that and for his en-
couragement.
                                 Note on Seript and Spelling   In October 1961, after this Grammar        had gone to press, the Government          of Eastern
Nigeria   announced   an official decision   about   script and spelling   for Igbo   which   can be
studied in the booklet issued by the Ministry of Education of Hastern Nigeria, ‘‘The Official
Igbo Orthography as recommended by the Onwu Committee in 1961: Notes on Seript and
Spelling for Teachers”’,
  In the official orthography Roman letters with diacritics are used for the vowels, as in this
Grammar. The consonants we use here for linguistic purposes are simplified in the official
orthography for use in general, written Igbo. The spelling differs in some small points from
ours, as, for example, in the use of a hyphen with the auxiliary verb and in writing -ghi
throughout instead of showing vowel harmony, ghi (-ghi) as we do in this book. But the prin-
ciples of word division are the same.
   For the convenience of readers who are accustomed to the former, so-called “new” ortho-
graphy, as used at one time by the Education Department in its periodical ‘‘Amamihe”, we
give a text in that orthography on p. 9, as well as in the transcription used in this book. The
official orthography has, of course, now rendered the “‘new’’ orthography obsolete.

                                             Introduetion   This study of the Igbo language is an essay in descriptive linguistics at the grammatical
level. But comparative and general linguistics must always be kept in mind and we believe
that Igbo has a contribution to make to them. Our knowledge of the tone languages of West
Africa is still very limited. Moreover, in his account of tone languages in general,!) Dr. Pike
does not record any with a mid tone of the particular kind found in Igbo, with the stresses
it sets up in the grammatical system through its occurence only in relation to a preceding
high tone.
   It is sometimes debated whether the study of a language should proceed from the largest
units to the smallest or in the opposite direction.?) We follow Dr. Haas in recognizing that
the “total utterance” or sentence, is the datum from which all lingustic research must set:
out and to which it must return.) In what order the component units of such data are ex-
plored would appear to be largely a matter of convenience.
   As to the order of exposition, in this book we have first described the units from smaller
to larger, giving a brief account at the phonological level in so far as it is necessary for an
understanding of the grammar. At the grammatical level we go on, in our first part, to
describe the grammatical system, still in ascending order, from morphemes to multiclausal
sentences. In the second part we reverse the process and analyse a complete text from larger
to smaller units, from sentences, through descending levels, to morphemes.!) The “system’’ —
la langue — is thus seen in action in the “‘text’’ — la parole —, and the text is explained by
reference to the system,°) each validating the other. In this way, too, the examples in Part I
are contextualised in a way which would be quite impracticable for each in its systematic
position.°)   1) K. L. Pike, ’Tone Languages“, Univ. of Michigan Press, 1948.

  6) The texts are also a guide, though a limited one, since they are but a small sample of the language,
to the relative frequency of occurrence of the various forms. The numbers of examples given in the
predecing chapters are in no way proportionate to the frequency of occurrence, in the language, of
the form exemplified.                    :
XII                                                       Introduction
   We try, throughout, to see the language as a whole and the grammatical facts in relation
to the series of systems within systems within which they occur.) Only thus can the subtle,
large scale oppositions be appreciated and the relations between apparently remote facts
grasped. What increases the difficulty of setting clearly before the reader the outlines of the
grammatical system of Igho is the fact that lexical elements — suffixes and a lexical prefix*)
— may be, and usually are, added to the grammatical forms, particularly in the verbal
system, modifying their meanings, though not their grammatical form, and thus suplement-
ing the somewhat slender resources of the grammar. This marked characteristic of the language
would seem to be of interest for comparative and general linguistics.
  In the recognition and classification of grammatical forms we have been                                         guided by the
principle, that the criterion of grammatical form is grammatical behaviour, the latter including
morphology and syntax.*) This need for formal, not notional, criteria has been stressed
recently by Professor Firth.*)
   Taking the total utterance as the essential linguistic datum helps to keep in its right per-
spective the factor of meaning. Clearly, grammatical forms cannot be discovered and classified
on a basis of notional criteria. Equally clearly they cannot, by an overswing of the pendulum,
be discovered among a series of sounds from which a consideration of meaning has been
excluded. If the principle of significance lies behind the recognition of the phonemes so does
it lie behind that of the grammatical forms,
   In our classification we proceed according to the principle of functional analysis and by
the method of substitutability in more complex units. We are indebted to Dr. Haas) for a
clarification of this principle, whereby lingusitic units are considered in relation to the larger,
more complex, units of a higher level, of which they are the constituents, and are thus given
synthetic definition. This means that, reciprocally, the larger unit of a higher level is given
analytic definition in terms of the lower level units which are its constituents.
   The problem of terminology is an awkward one, and there is no easy solution. We have
tried to avoid coining new terms where possible, though in the description of the Igbo verb,
the nerve centre of this language, labels such as ‘‘tense’’ and ‘“‘mood’’ have been avoided as
likely to be misleading rather than helpful. Where we have used such traditional terms as
those for the parts of speech and the secondary grammatical categories of person, number
and so on, their meaning must be sought in the facts of the Igbo language to which they are
applied.*)
   Further problems are raised by the lack of a generally accepted usage among linguists of
such words, for instance, as “morpheme’’. The translation of examples, moreover, presents
a hurdle which has to be got over somehow. An adequate rendering would involve a degree    1) See L. Hjelmslev, “La catégorie des cas’, Acta Jutlandica, VII, i, 1948, p. 86.
    2) The lexical na-(ne-) prefix to the verb must be carefully distinguished from the inflexional, vowel
prefix, a-(e-). For specially interesting points about the suffixes see infra, p. 67, p. 118, and

mean “grammatical form’’.

be amplified by the reader in the context of the texts.
   Igbo is a language of West Africa spoken by about five million people in South Eastern
Nigeria’). It has many dialects, and the first essential for a deseription of the grammar such
as we have attempted here is that it should be confined to one dialect. It may then serve
as a possible basis for a comparative study of the others. The dialect we examine here is spoken
near Umuahia by the people known as Ohuhu?). Our analysis is based chiefly on the speech
of three speakers living within a few miles of each other in this dialect area, all young and
travelled men and thus tending to speak their dialect, not in the “deep’’ version that would
be used among the older people, but in a rather more general form. All have a good knowledge
of English and have had a higher Western Edueation, and all have had some training in
the study — which is quite a different thing from the speaking — of their own language. We
have all, with various interruptions,     been working on this dialect since    1947.
  Linguistic research is always on the horns of a dilemma.          If the speech of one    individual
is studied there is no check on individual idiosyncracies. If several speakers are taken, a
composite picture may be the outcome. We are aware that we have not altogether avoided
either horn.
   We have not come upon anything in the nature of “special”             languages, whether for the
different sexes or for different sections of the community. In the largely unstratified condition
of Igbo society this is hardly surprising.
   In a partnership of two authors such as those of the present book, inevitably the material
is supplied by the Igbo speaker. The theoretical work of classification is, on the whole, the
work   of the other partner, on whom,      therefore, responsibility in this respect must rest. But
the work has been incalculably helped by stimulating suggestion and encouragement from
the Igbo partner and the zest of joint discovery in the marvel that is language.","[11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19]"

General      Characteristics of the Verb              System  The verb in Igho is characterised by great complexity of detail but by simplicity and sym-
metry of system. It is therefore important to gragp, at the outset, the main outlines of the
system.
 Putting aside the infinitive, which is a nomino-verbal form, we find that the verb falls into
three divisions, the Imperative, the Narrative, and the Subject Ver) Forms. We use the
neutral term “division” rather than the term “mood’’, which has associations that render it
unsuitable for the Igbo verb system.
  The three divisions have clear formal distinctions. In the imperative             the verb can be. and
frequently is, used without a subject and as a complete utterance.
   The narrative never has an immediate subject; it shares the subject of the verb form it
follows. It is never used as a complete utterance.
   The Subject Verb Forms’), as the name implies, do not appear without a subject.2)We again
choose this neutral term rather than the traditional ‘indicative’, in order to avoid misleading
associations. And we speak of Subject Verb Forms I and II instead of speaking of “‘tenses’’).
There     is little, if any,   “time”   distinction   between   the two   Subject   Verb   Forms’),   such
distinction being made by the addition of lexical suffixes, that is to say, by compounding and
not by grammatical elements (see p. 53). The clearest formal distinction between the two
Subject Verb Forms in addition to tone, is the presence or absence of the inflexional vowel
prefix to the verb stem. The prefix, @-(c-), harmonizes with the vowel of the verb stem. In
the non-auxiliary,        affirmative forms of the verb,    Subject Verb Form I      has a vowel prefix,
Example: Any? ala ahya, and Subject Verb Form I has none, Example: Any? la ahya.                        In
the negative of these forms, on the contrary, the position is reversed and Subject Verb Form I
has a prefix and Subject Verb Form IT has none. There is thus a double, systematic opposition
through presence or absence of prefix as between affirmative and negative and as between the
two Subject Verb Forms. That between affirmative and negative is also found in the impera-
tive division. The inseparable singular pronouns are, however, never followed by the vowel
prefix in any verb form.
   The tonal relation of the verb to its subject is an integral part of the verb form. In the
affirmative each Subject Verb Form has one tone pattern with which it can be used as a
complete, unlinked utterance and which we call the main form. Each has also a number
of different tone patterns which are used in clauses of incomplete utterance and which we call
the various subordinate forms. We give below examples for Subject Verb Form I, affirmative.

so-called tense sterns indicating different “aspects” of the verbal action. Latin, however, evolved a
comprehensive system of references to present, future and past, with each of its two aspectual stems

both in the affirmative and in the negative!). When this fourfold system is set out in tabular
form, as in the Verb Tables®), its symmetry and simplicity of outline becomes apparent.
   The simplicity of the Igbo verb system is, however, complicated in usage by the addition
of suffixes. These are lexical, or compounding elements, as has already been pointed out.
They are not exclusive to any one form. They may modify the meaning of the verb in various
ways or help to distinguish between homonymous verbs, or they may sometimes act as signals
to indicate which verb form is being used, without being an essential part of it*).
  Tt will be seen from the diagram                   on p, 66 that for the Subject Verb Forms alone, both
affirmative and negative, thirteen                   verb forms have to distinguish themselves from one
another using only two morphome constituents, verb stem and vowel prefix, in addition to
tone and syntax. It must also be noted that a yerb form will sometimes have an intonational
variant’) and may also have a different tone pattern with or without an object. There is,
moreover, the fact that the inseparable pronoun subjects never immediately precede the verbal
vowel prefix. It is omitted. Thus a great deal of distinctive work has to be done by tone, and
in those instances where there are only two syllables with which to do it — monosyllabic
pronoun and verb stem — ambiguity is bound to arise. One might almost say that too many
tone patterns are chasing two few syllables. The context will of course help, but a further
clue may be supplied by a suffix.
   This ad hoe addition of suffixes makes the setting out of the verb forms in paradigms a
much less tidy              and,   for the reader,     a   more   exacting   affair   than   for   a   language   like
Latin.
    There is also a lexical prefix, na-(ne-), of which the vowel harmonizes with the stem vowel
of the verb, and which occurs only with the subordinate, relative A and B forms of the verb
which have an inflexional vowel prefix, that is to say with the relative A and B forms of
Subject Verb Form II, non-auxiliary and auxiliary, and the relative A and B forms of the
negative Subject Verb Form I, non-auxiliary and auxiliary. The na- prefix changes neither
the meaning nor the syntactical behaviour of the verb form and its use is optional, though
it is much used by Ohuhu speakers. But it helps to distinguish the relative verb forms from
others with which they might be confused but which never use this prefix. It makes clear,
inter alia, even with the inseparable pronoun subjects, that a form of the verb with inflexional
vowel prefix is being used. When the na- prefix follows these pronouns the inflexional vowel
prefix after na- is maintained instead of being omitted.
   Thus there are many lexical amplifications which blur the outlines of the grammatical
forms. Yet to give the bare grammatical forms without these additions would be to give an
abstraction in place of the rich reality of the language. It is, as we have said, by this prolifera-
tion of lexical elements rather than bya complexity of grammatical forms that time meanings,
for instance, are given to the verb. Many verbs, also, depend on the lexical suffixes to give
them statement force. Without them their usage is exclamatory. This can be seen in the Verb
Tables on page 179. These Tables will help to make clear the essential grammatical outlines    1) Negative verb forms are so labelled in this book. Forms not so labelled are to be taken as
affirmative.

pointed    out that some   of these unsuffixed forms would,        with       many verbs,   only be found
in restricted contexts. The Tables should thus be used in close connection with the verb
chapters, which give many examples with suffixes.
     In the following chapters, which set out each of the verb forms in turn, we have not always
given separate paradigms for high and low tone verbs in those forms where                     their tonal
behaviour is alike.
   For some verb forms, moreover, in place of full paradigms we have given short ones of
the type used in the Verb Tables?). They give the essential information about the verb
form as can be seen by comparing them with the full paradigms and by grasping the tonal
behaviour of pronoun and noun subjects *).
   Where proper names have been used as subject or object, their tonal behaviour is as for
any noun of the same tone class‘).","[84, 85, 86, 87, 88]"

54                                     Green/Igwe,    Grammar of IgboThe fact that in some dialects, though not in Ohuhu, the vowel of the element -cha, to which
we referred above, harmonizes with the vowel of the verb stem it follows, is a piece of evidence
pointing to the verbal origin, in some cases at least, of suffixes.
   With a verb stem containing a nasal or nasalized consonant the nasality runs on through
some suffixes but not through others. In compound verbs the position seems to be that
nasality will not run on from the first verb stem to the second if there is thereby any danger
of confusion of meaning.        If there is no such danger the nasality may      or may     not run on.
Here, therefore, there seems to be no clear distinction between compound verb and verb plus
suffix?),
      As to the meaning of the suffixes, it should be noted that those with a time meaning often
supply the verb forms with time distinctions which are absent from the verb forms themselves
and which forms we thus do not call “tenses”. Very many other meanings are added to the
verb forms by the suffixes, among which the time meanings take their place.
   We give below a few notes about some of the frequently used suffixes but any exhaustive
account is proper to a lexical rather than a grammatical study of the language and we do
not attempt it here”).","[73, 74]"
"                                              4. Nouns in Genitival Relationship  A noun can follow another noun in genitival relationship. The tonal behaviour of both
nouns is then involved. The situation is therefore different from that of a language like Latin,
for instance, where only the noun in the genitive case is inflected. For example, if ddha “eldest
daughter’ follows d/a in genitival relationship we get 0 zur dla ddha “He bought the eldest
daughter's land”’ (lit. land of eldest daughter). Both nouns have taken non-inherent tones.
In the same way, if ji “yam” follows wld ‘“house”’ in genitival relationship we get 0 hard
ulo jt,“He saw the yam store’’ (lit. house of yams). There are also instances where only one
of the nouns takes non-inherent tones, and others, all according to definite rules, where both
nouns retain their inherent tones. Always it is the genitival noun which comes second. The
noun preceding it may be said to be in pre-genitival position.
   In the tables which follow, the pairs of nouns could occur in utterances of the type given
in the foregoing examples, that is to say following Subject Verb Form I, main. ‘This provides
a convenient syntactical context though others would be possible.
   Some tone classes of nouns have two sets of tones in genitival relationship, one when the
genitive noun is used in its ordinary sense and one when the animal or thing it denotes is
personified or used as a person's name. Since Igbo fables, i/e, are full of personified animals
and since personal names are often the names of objects or animals, the genitive of personi-
fication is of frequent occurence. Thus we get, for instance, isi eny! “elephant's head” and
ist Pnyi ‘the head of Elephant (or Mr. Elephant)”.
   Nouns in reduplication also have the tones of the genitive of personification.*) Examples:
Odi ikhe tkhe “It            is rather hard”       (as of pounded     food (fufu)). 14 di iché \ehe “They          are

bo Nouns          of More   Than       Two     Syllables,     Genitive      These nouns follow, in principle, the tonal behaviour of disyllabic nouns. The tone of the
 first syllable behaves as does that of the disyllable in relation to the tone of the syllable that
precedes it. The tone of the last syllable behaves as does that of a disyllable in relation to
what follows it. Thus with dkuké “hen’’, we find akhwa dkukd “hen's egg” and dkuk Adha
“Adha's hen’, With akwukwo we get isi akwukwo “chapter of the book’’ and akwukwe Adha
“Adha's book’’.
      It is therefore unnecessary to set out tables of trisyllabic genitives. Many examples will be
 found in the texts.
      In this connection an interesting point may be noted. In the tone pattern of nouns in
genitival relationship, with one exception, the tone which changes in the second, or genitive,
noun is that of the syllable adjacent to the pre-genitival noun. In the case of N hh, however,
it is the tone of the second, or non-adjacent, syllable which changes, as in ist eght “goat's
head”’. This shows clearly that the unit involved in the tone change is the part of speech and
not merely the juxtaposed syllables. This principle of tone change on account of what pre-
cedes does not, however, carry further than two syllables. With a trisyllabic noun such, for
instance, as N hhh, we get isi akwukwo.                There is no tone change on the final syllable. Any
change in the final tone of a trisyllabic noun comes,                  as has been shown above, in relation to
what follows, as in ¢kuko Adha.","[40, 41, 42]"

                                                Chapter II                                                 Tonology
   Following the definition of Dr. Pike we may say that a tone language is one in which
contrastive pitch levels do not merely form the intonation tune of a sentence as, for instance,
in English, but enter as distinctive factors into the lexical elements of the language, and in
some languages, of which Igbo is one, into the grammar as well.
   It has also been suggested by Dr. Pike!) that, on the basis of our present knowledge, tone
languages may be divided into two main types, the register-tone type with level tonemes of
contrastive pitch and the contour-tone type with contrastive glides of pitch. A language may
be predominantly of one type or the other but may yet have occasional features of the other
type.
   On this basis Igbo may be described as a register-tone type of language with a number of
level tonemes. But it has also a relatively small number of significant glides which oceur not
lexically but grammatically. These must be carefully distinguished, as Ida Ward pointed
out?), from the non-significant, inter-syllabie glides which are produced by the transition
from one level toneme to another when no consonant separates the toneme-bearing vowel
syllables. The significant glides take place within the syllable.
     The significant tone or pitch levels of a language may be called tonemes as the significant
sounds may be called phonemes. In Igbo there are three significant contrastive pitch levels or
tonemes, a high, a low and a mid, the last occurring only after a preceding high level toneme.
Thus there is a high mid tone relationship but no such low mid relationship. A tone following
a low tone on a higher level is a high tone, and a tone following a mid tone on the same level     1) K. L, Pike, op. cit.,p. 5.     *) I. C, Ward, op. cit., p. 15.
                                                 Chapter III.      Tonology                                                   7 is a high tone. Since a mid tone is only found in relation to an immediately preceding high tone
 it can itself he followed by a mid tone because it is itself high in relation to what follows.
    It is esential for an understanding of the language to grasp from the outset the character-
 istics of the mid toneme.') Moreover, the tension between the tonal and the grammatical
 systems of the language can only be understood by realising that the mid toneme is a relative
 toneme which         does not occur in isolation but             is found only in relation to an immediately
 preceeding high tone.?)
   There are thus the following tone relationships in Igbo:                          high high, as in imi “nose’’;
high mid, as in miri “‘water”; high low, as in mba “village”; low low, as in dé ‘‘earth’’; low
high, as in adha “eldest daughter’); There are also two independent tone levels, high, as in
je “yam”        and low, as in na “and’’.
    The fact that Igbo has only three level tonemes does not, of course, mean that only three
 tone, or pitch, levels are used by the language. An utterance may have five or six levels but
they will consist in combinations of the three tonemes. Example: Q dj ot nwa agboghd neéywe-
 ght nne      na nnd. “There was a girl who             had      no mother       or father.” (Text I, sent. I.) Here
six tone levels are used, but each is either a high, mid or low toneme. Each syllable carries only
one toneme. A convenient way of speaking of the tonal sequence of a phrase like ywa
agbogho is: high mid level mid, so long as it is understood that the “‘level’’ tone is, tonologi-
cally, a high tone.*)
   Glides from one level to another can often be heard in an utterance but for the most part,
as we have said, they are non-significant and are due to the fact that one vowel follows
another on a different tone level with no intervening                          consonant.    Example:        Aka a. “This
hand”.        Ya dzdala ald. “She has swept the ground.”
   These       non-significant,      inter-syllablic    glides    must    be    carefully    distinguished      from    the
significant glides which take place within a syllable. The latter presumably differ from the
glides of a contour-type of language in that they only occur grammatically and not lexically.
They express certain grammatical relationships. It is required, for instance, that the syllable
preceding       Subject      Verb   Form   I, main,    affirmative’),     should    either be low or should fall to
low. If, therefore, that syllable is not already low it falls to low. Example: Adhd rird ji.
‘“Adha ate yam.” The lexical tone pattern of Adha is low high. But in this syntactical position
the tone of the second syllable glides very rapidly to low. That the glide does not, in principle,
lengthen the syllable is shown paradigmatically by the fact that a disyllabic noun with high
low tones remains unaltered. Examples: Mbé riri ji. “The tortoise ate yam.’’®)
   A further example of asyllabic glide isfound insome forms of the auxiliary form of a low
tone verb. Thus we find, I nd eké anu ’mu ana aciri, “As you keep dividing out meat I'll keep
taking up the shares.’’ Compare              this with     / na deita nkhu ’mu and eké ya, “As you keep    1) Dr. Pike has unfortunately failed to grasp the relative nature of the mid toneme in Igbo and has
altered the tone notation of the examples he has quoted from Ida Ward in his book and has thus mis-
represented the tonal system of the language. Nor does he, in his book, envisage                  the possibility of such
a relative tone. (See Pike, op. cit., p. 31.)
   2)   See   p. 25 infra.
   3) Interclausally, a high tone following a previous high tone may, in certain circumstances, have a
higher tone level, which we call a ‘‘higher than high” tone. It may               also be   found within a clause, asso-
ciated with pause, But this is not another toneme.

equivalent in the high tone verb form a level, unlengthened syllable and must therefore itself
be considered paradigmatically, or tonologically, unlengthened.","[26, 27, 28]"

will buy meat”. But O ga dazu an is also found.
   The true auxiliary, however, is never found as a full verb but only immediately before the
participle of a verb. Nor does the auxiliary fall into either of the categories of high or low   1) Whether some of these lexical suffixes are on the way to becoming inflexional is an interesting,
speculative question.

Example: ind dfu oF i “to go on working”. In Subject Verb Form IT, on the contrary we find
the tonal behaviour of a high tone verb. Example: Ya dna d7u ori “And he was working”’.
   A further tonal characteristic which has been found only with the auxiliary is the absence
of a falling tone on the last syllable of tone group I noun subjects in Subject Verb Form I,
main, auxiliary. Example: Oke na ata akha “A rat eats palm nuts’. This contrasts with the
non-auxiliary form, Oké tara akhu “The rat ate palm nuts”.
   For every non-auxiliary verb form there is a corresponding auxiliary form, the latter
usually having a habitual, or, in some contexts, a progressive meaning. It has no fixed refer-
ence to past, present, or future time, apart from the context, or the particular construction
in which it may oecur,
   Many of the suffixes are found on the participle in the auxiliary verb forms. On the auxi-
liary verb itself, however, a very restricted range is found. The -ra (time) suffix can be added
to if in Subject Verb Form I, main, and also relative A and B. The suffixes -ghi, -la, -kwa
and -md are also found on the auxiliary in certain verb forms).","[161, 162]"
"  The -la suffix is much used with the Question Form. But the following rhetorical question
should be noted, with the verb unsuffixed and with something of the exclamatory force that
was noted in the main (initiating) form:

          change in the meaning of the example. When used with affirmative verb forms this
          sulfix is often found following the -la suffix, as it is here.
             We find a variant tonal form in which tone group I objects retain their inherent
          tones, as above, though the verb form no longer ends on a low tone. An example is
          given below.
             Ebe any agalaghi, ma dnyi dgalaghi                  (Translation as for previous example)

  Its tone is high for high tone verbs and low for low tone verbs, except when the latter are
unsuffixed and followed by certain objects. Whereas the Subject Verb Forms always have
a subject and the imperative often has one, the narrative is distinguished by the fact that
it has no subject. Example:            Mgbé anyt gara ahya zug anu      ree   manu’any}   hur   ya   (V-h.
with open    vowel      suffix in both instances) ‘When we went to market and bought meat and
sold oil we saw him”. It may be said to be in co-ordinate relationship to the verb form it
follows since that verb form could, formally, be substituted for it,
  The narrative occurs only in clauses of incomplete utterance, and its tone level, in relation
to the last syllable of the preceding clause, involves the question of interclausal relations,
as was also the case with Subject Verb Form II, main. When the narrative form of a high
tone verb occurs after a non-low syllable it is sometimes found on a higher tone level than
that syllable and bears a “higher than high” tone mark. This is usually the case when it
follows a main verb form, but not when it follows a subordinate form or when it immediately
follows the verbs of motion zga and ibyd. Its high tone is then level with the preceding syl-
lable. This can be seen in the examples which are given below of these various syntactical
situations. But it must also be borne in mind that even after a main verb form the narrative
clause will not have the “‘higher than high” tone level if its clause is final and if it expresses
close continuity with the action of the main verb form. Thus we find Agara ii ahya, ‘gaa
or “I went to market and went (also) to the farm”. But Agara m ahya gaa ory “I went to
the farm via the market’’. In the same way we get, Agard m ahya, ’zuo anu “T went to market,
and I bought meat’. Here the two actions are, as it were, distinct. But in Agard m ahya zuo
an they are closely connected?).
  Many    suffixes are found with this form, but not the -ra (time) suffix, so far as has been
observed. The open vowel suffix frequently occurs.","[129, 130, 131]"

  The open vowel suffix has a wide distribution,                            being found with verbs, the cognate object,
and with verbal nouns. Among the verb forms it has not been found in the negative and it
is noteworthy that it is not found with Subject Verb Form I, main, or relative A or B af-
firmative.      It will be remembered            that,      with     these       affimative       forms,        when     two    -ra suffixes
are present one of them is represented by its alternant, a vowel which lengthens the vowel
of the preceding syllable. In the case of open vowels we should thus get
                                                                      a suffix indistinguish-
able from the open vowel suffix. In the same way, the -ra(time) suffix is not found with
the Imperative        or Narrative,          with both      of which         the open           vowel     suffix occurs.
  As to the meaning of this suffix, it adds a sense of completion to the action of the verb.
But it does rather more than this in some instances. With many verbs the unsuffixed, mono-
syllabic imperative not only has a sense of incomplete action but is used in an abrupt or
peremptory manner. For example Vi abo! “Lift the basket!” is less polite as well as suggesting
a less complete action than Vio abd! “Lift and carry to its destination the basket!’’ Other
suffixes can also be used to lessen the abruptness of the monosyllabic imperative but
the    open vowel     suffix is one of the most common.                         With     Subject Verb           Form IT (main), also,
the presence of this suffix is, with many verbs, more usual — one might almost say more
normal — than its absence. Without it the verb has a sense of beginning to do something
rather than of actually doing it. But here again other suffixes can also be used.
   Just as we found the -ra(non-time) suffix being used to differentiate homonymous verbs,
so we find the open vowel suffix being used, apparently for the same purpose. For instance,
with the two verbs thu (in “deep” Ohuhu, which is itself Ohwuhwy, we find thwu) which mean
respectively       “to see”   and      “‘to roast”,        we get usually,              though          not exclusively,         ] hula ya?
‘Have you seen it?” but / huola ya? “Have you roasted it?” The possibility of punning with
the two verbs is not neglected by speakers of the language.
      Constant examples of this suffix will be found in the texts and there are also some in the
verb chapters but we give a few below.","[78, 79]"

    A noun immediately following a verb form, and in a special tonal relationship to it, is said
 to be the object of the verb. Many examples of noun objects will be found in the chapters on
 the verb. Here we look at the system as a whole and so are able to see the broad principles by
 which it works. They raise some interesting points.
   As in the genitive, we find the principle of a lowering of tone in the noun object, either
 within the tone pattern of the noun itself or in its relation to the preceding tone of the verb.
 Tone group IT nouns, which end inherently on a low tone, retain their inherent tones, as
 they do in the non-personified genitive. Examples: 0 ziola ité “She has bought a cooking
 pot”’. O ztola akeed “She has bought cloth”.
    The behaviour of tone group I noun objects is less simple, and for an obvious reason. In
 principle they take the same non-inherent tones in objective relationship that they did in
 genitival. Examples: 0 ziola ani “He has bought meat’. 0 zuola akhwa ‘He has bought
 eggs’’. Zio ant “Buy meat’’. Zio akhwa “Buy eggs’’ etc. But N lh cannot take its non-inherent
 mid level tones after a preceding low tone because, in the tonal system of the language, a
 mid tone does not occur except in relation to a preceding high tone?), It will be remembered
 that in the genitive, when N lh was preceded by a noun ending on a low tone, that noun
 took non-inherent tones in which its final low tone was suppressed. Thus with N hl, odhw,
 preceding Nlh, ke, we found odhu ake “monkey’s tail’’.
   But when N lh is the object of a verb form ending on a low tone, matters are different.
 The verb form does not modify its tones”). When, for both high and low tone verbs, a verb
 form has both verb stem and suffix, if present, on a low tone, N lh object retains its inherent
tones. Examples: O zit adkhwa “He bought eggs’’. O vi bhe “He is (was) carrying pears’’.
The grammatical requirement of tone change, in fact, is limited by the possibilities of the
tonal system.
   In this syntactical situation there is no tonal obstacle to prevent N hh taking its non-
inherent, high mid tones. But it does not do so. It maintains the solidarity of tonal behaviour
of tone group I and retains its inherent tones where N lh does so. Examples:                    0 zuri anu
 “He bought meat’’. O vi abe “He is (was) carrying a basket’’.
   To these points of interest another         must   be added.      Where the verb form of a low tone
verb has stem, and suffix if present, on low tones, tone group I noun objects retain their in-
herent tones not only here but after the equivalent verb form of a high tone verb. Examples:
Ekélé anu “Don’t share out meat’’. Ekélé alehwa “Don’t share out eggs’. Here, after the nega-
tive imperative of a low tone verb, with its low tones, it is tonally impossible for N lh to
take its non-inherent tones. But there is no tonal impossibility after the negative imperative
of a high tone verb. Nevertheless we find tone group I noun objects retaining their inhe-
rent tones, Examples:       Azzila anu    ‘Don’t buy meat’. Azila dkhwa “Don’t buy eggs“.
   Tt might almost be said that here the grammatical system is double crossing the tonal. In
the first place, in principle, the grammar requires non-inherent tones in tone group I noun
objects. In fact, after certain verb forms this is tonally impossible and the grammar gives
way to the tonal system. Where, however, non-inherent tones of tone group I would be
tonally possible after a high tone verb but not after a low tone one, it seems that the grammar
insists on the equivalent verb forms being treated alike.","[44, 45]"

of this verb form in clauses of complete utterance, though frequent in colloquial speech,
is thus highly restricted, and is not comparable with the behaviour of Subject Vers Form I

overlooked and we give some examples             below.","[104, 105]"

174                                      Green/Igwe,    Grammar of Igbo  The only verb forms that have been found in adjectival clauses are relative A and B forms.
The first three examples above have A forms and the last two B.
  The clauses are clearly cach substitutable by an adjective and they have the limited syn-
tactical     behaviour     of an adjective,   being found   only immediately   after a nominal,    which
they qualify.')
   It will be realised that with a relative A verb form the subject of the adjectival clause is
also a constituent of the accompanying clause. In the first example, for instance, anu is the
subject of di n’uld, and        anu qualified    by di n’uld is the subject of d) mma.   It is di n’ulo
which is substitutable by an adjective and which must be considered the adjectival clause.
  The limited, adjectival nature of these clauses can be scen very clearly in the first example
where di n’uld is anchored to the preceding syllable by its mid tone, which, as we have seen pre-
viously, is tonally non-existent except after a preceding high tone. Noun clauses, on the
other hand, have a variety of syntactical behaviour that adjectival clauses, like adjectives,
do not
   A further noteworthy point about adjectival clauses is that they are so intimately bound
up with the construction in which they occur that that construction, in many cases, could
not stand formally unaltered without them. In the first example, if di n’ulo is removed, the
tone pattern of anu will be modified and we shall get And di mma “The meat is good”,
because a low, or high falling to low, tone is required before a Subject Verb Form I, main.
That low tone, in the original example, was supplied by the last syllable of wld. Again, in the
last example, if the adjectival clause 0 nd éri is removed, the tone pattern of thye will change
to thyé.
   It will be noted that these clauses can occur within the body of another clause. In this
they appear to be unique, other clauses remaining juxtaposed.
     Many more examples of adjectival clauses will be found in the texts. The whole question
should be studied in relation to the tonal behaviour of the various verb forms.","[193, 194]"

                                                     Chapter XIIT                                                       Suffixes     Igbo is rich in suffixes, with syllabic component v or cv, some of which can be affixed to
 verbs, nominals, nomino-verbals, interrogatives and conjunctions, while some have only been
 found with verbs or verbal nouns. The most frequent use of the suffixes is with verbs, and
 here an interesting point arises which is discussed in connection with the verb forms').
     The suffixes may nearly all be described as high tone since, when affixed to verbs, they
 have the same tonal behaviour as the second member of a compound verb when that
 member, by itself, is a high tone verb. There are a few low tone suffixes with a somewhat
 restricted distribution,      whose     tonal   behaviour,     so far as has been         observed,     is the same     as
 that of the second member of a compound verb when that member, by itself, is a low tone
 verb.
     The   suffixes   are lexical, or compounding, elements             and      neither    derivational    nor,   as has
 sometimes been thought, inflexional, They are not constitutive of parts of speech as are the
 derivational affixes which       are found, for instance, in nouns. Nor are they distinguishing char-
 acteristics of the various verb forms as is the inflexional verbal vowel prefix.
    They are a frequently used feature of the language and have a rich variety of meaning,
particularly when several of them are combined.                    Some verb forms rarely appear without a
suffix of some kind, which may do the work of a preposition in English, as in “put in’, “‘put
on”, and so on. And just as we cannot speak of an “in” or an “‘on” tense of the verb in
English, so we cannot speak of a -ra or a -la form of the verb?) in Igbo if by form we mean
grammatical form, as we do in this book.
   The fact that these suffixes are compounding, or lexical, elements is further brought out by
the difficulty of finding any clear formal distinction between compound verbs (verb plus verb)
and verb plus suffix. This suggests that the suffixes may originally have been verbs, and in some
eases we class as verbs what have sometimes been considered as suffixes, for instance -cha, which
we look on as the stem of the verb icha, “to change colour, ripen’ hence “‘to be complete’.
One of the characteristics of compound verbs, however, is absence of vowel harmony*) between
the vowels of the two stems. Examples: ighudha “to cut down” or idufi “to lead out’. When,
therefore, we find a compounding element in which, as in these examples, the vowel of this
element does not harmonize with the vowel of the verb stem it follows, we have to see whether,
on semantic grounds, it can be associated with any verb. If it can, we tentatively classify
it as a verb, if not, as a suffix. With some suffixes, however, the vowel harmonizes with, or
reduplicates the vowel of the verb stem it follows, and here we seem to have a formal criterion
by which it can be distinguished from a verb. When we find a harmonizing suffix which
appears to be cognate with a verb we class it as a suffix none the less because of its behaviour.","[72, 73]"

   *) The above examples, with their indifference, apart from the context, to a “position in time‘

  Note the high falling to low tone of the final syllable of the nouns of tone group I in the
above paradigm, where they immediately precede the verb. Lexically this tone group has
the final syllable on a high tone. Here, therefore, we have a non-inherent tone pattern. The

keep their inherent tone pattern in front of the verb.

     When     the   -ra(time) suffix is added to it, Subject Verb Form I has statement               foree with
all verbs. It has, moreover, a past time meaning. It is much used and appears as a statement
in conversation or the answer to a question or to initiate a narrative. It is also found in the~
body of a narrative, often as a stylistic alternative to Subject Verb Form IJ, main (non-
initiating),Examples:
       Vh.      O ynweére ako na uce                       ‘She was clever and wise” (Text I, sent. 3).
   In the text this clause of complete utterance is followed by a clause of incomplete utter-
ance but its presence is, formally, unnecessary.   The example given can equally well stand
alone as a complete sentence. This is also the case with tho following example.
                Oméra mma            ke   wkwu             “She was very beautiful’ (Text I, sent. 2)
                O ciri eghu                                “He herded goats”
     This could be statement or answer’).
       V.1.     O kere akhwa                               “He shared out eggs”’
   This could be a statement. A. (man, woman or child) might say for instance, on returning
from some gathering where things had been shared out, that B. (man or woman) shared out
nuts. To this C. (man, woman or child) might deny and say, as in the above example, “He
shared out eggs’’. It could also be an answer to a question.
     Further examples       will be found in the texts. As the tonal behaviour of the verb form is
unaltered by the addition of this suffix it is unnecessary to give full paradigms as for the
unsuffixed form,With     -ra(non-time)      suffix
     This suffix has only       been found with this verb form        in conjunction with      the     -ra(time)
suffix, As we have already seen*), when both these suffixes are present one of them is usually
represented by an alternant, a vowel, which lengthens the vowel that precedes it. This
reduplicating vowel suffix must not be confused with the open vowel suffix, which expands
a close stem vowel and lenthens an open one and which we have never found with this verb
form’).
   The wide range of meaning of the -ra(non-time) suffix is discussed in the chapter on the
suffixes, to which reference should be made.","[94, 95, 96]"
"General      Principles    of Genitival      Tonal     Behaviour  An examination of the tables of nouns in genitival relationship shows that the detailed tone
changes are characterizad by a consistent tendency, that of a lowering of tone in the second,
or genitival, noun.') This can be seen particularly clearly in tone groups I and IT, in which
the majority of disyllabic nouns are found. The lowering takes place either within the tone
pattern of the second, or genitival, noun, or in the relation of its tone pattern to that of the
noun in pre-genitival position. This tendency is most plainly observable in the genitives of
personification, where the first syllable of the genitival noun is always on either a mid or a
low tone after the preceding noun, with its next syllable on a level with the first. Example:
isi Eghu, dhu Mbe.
   With the genitives of non-personification the tendency is equally present and it is tone
group I nouns, with their final high tone inherently, which take non-inherent tones in the
genitive. Thus we find isi eghw, where the lowering comes on the second syllable of the geni-
tival noun, and ahy dke, where the tone pattern of the second noun changes from low high
and has a flattened out, mid level relationship to the preceding noun.
  Tone group IT nouns end inherently on a low tone and thus, in contrast to tone group I,
retain their inherent tones in the genitive, as in isi mbé or ul mbé or dhu énwod. But, in
contrast again with tone group I, these tone group II nouns take non-inherent tones in pre-
genitival position where the total tone pattern requires it. A tone group I noun, for instance,
such as Oke, of the N lh tone class, cannot take its genitival, mid level tones after a preceding
low tone. Such a tonal relationship does not exist in Igbo”). Thus the preceding low tone is
raised and we find odhu dke, “rat’s tail‘, or abha oke, “rat’s jaw’.
  It is important to bear in mind this principle of tonal behaviour, whereby the tone classes
of nouns of tone group I retain or change their inherent tones in the same circumstances
and those of tone group II do likewise in their same circumstances. The principle will be
found again,     with interesting concomitants,      in the tonal behaviour of noun   subjects and
objects of the verb.*)   1) This contrasts with the tonal behaviour of the second noun when is a second object and not a
genitive (see p. 26),
  *) See p. 6.
  3) See p. 24—25.

Forms may be said to be the subject of the verb if a pronoun is formally substitutable. This
grammatical relationship is expressed not only by word order but by tone. In the chapters
on the verb the tonal behaviour of the noun subjects          has   been   set out   in detail,   and   as
such it presents a somewhat formidable appearance. But when it is seen as a whole the
system becomes apparent. In some verb forms all noun subjects retain their inherent tones,
In those where they do not, tone group I nouns take non-inherent tones in a certain set of
circumstances and tone group II nouns in a different set.
  The tonal behaviour of noun subjects in the non-auxiliary verb forms may be set out as
follows:
  In the imperative and imperative negative, noun subjects retain their inherent tones.","[43, 44]"

we may call Tone Form         ii. In this, both pronoun and prefix are on low tones. The tone of
the verb stem is high for both high and low tone verbs. It is followed, in accordance with
the typical negative tone pattern, by another syllable on a mid or a low tone. Whether it is
mid or low depends on the tonal conjugation of the verb, the inherent tone of the suffix, and
the presence or absence of object. With a non-compound verb this syllable will be one of the
suffixes, and -ghi is frequently used. Example: Any? azughi anu (V.h.) ‘We didn’t buy meat’.
The low tone suffix -bd is often found also. Example: O cibo akhu (V.h.) “He hasn’t yet
taken away the nuts’’, But with a compound verb an extra syllable is supplied by the second
verb stem. Thus, with the compound verb imeéechi, ““to shut’’, we find, Anyi emechighi anya
“We didn’t shut our eyes’. The -ghz (-ghi) is optional, the tone pattern being complete
without it'). This is not the case with a simple verb. The suffix appears to be required as a
tone bearing syllable.
      It will be noted that in both Tone Form i and ii there is either a high mid or a high low tonal
interval within the verb form. In the first it is between prefix and verb stem. In the second,
which is the only negative verb form with a low prefix, it is between the verb stem and the
following syllable, whether the latter is a second verb stem or a suffix. With the prefix on
a low tone this syllable following the verb stem is vital to the maintainance of the typical
negative high mid or high low tone pattern. It is also important since a low prefix and high
verb stem are found in Subject Verb Vorm IT, main, affirmative.
   Both tone forms are used in clauses of complete utterance and Tone Form i is also used                 in
ma — ma — “whether — or —” clauses.
      Unlike the affirmative, there is no distinct tonal question form in the negative.        Both Tone
Form i and ii can be used either as statement or question. according to the context, but there
is a tendency to understand Tone Formi, with pronoun subjects, as a question. If either form
is used as a question with a noun subject a pronoun subject must also be present after the
noun,     as in the affirmative.","[137, 138]"

Lexical     and   Grammatical         Tone
    Tone is a lexical factor in Igbo and distinguishes words which, from a phonetic, or segmen-
tal, point of view, are identical.    A very large number of verbs, for instance, are distinguished
only by tone. In the infinitive of non-compound verbs the stem syllable may be either on a
mid or a low tone in relation to the high tone vowel prefix. Thus we get ivé “to carry” and
ivt “to be fat’. A difference of tonal behaviour will persist throughout the verb forms of
these two verbs, thus keeping them distinct.
  Again we find nouns such as oke “rat’’, and oké ‘“‘share’’, distinguished by their lexical tones.
By lexical tones we mean the tones the word has in isolation. These tones may often occur
when the word is no longer isolated but is part of an utterance. In this situation we speak,
not of the lexical but of the inherent, tones or tone pattern. In many utterances, however,
the tones will have changed and we then speak of the non-inherent tones or tone pattern.
In O gbiole oke, “He has killed a rat’’, we speak of oke as having non-inherent tones or a non-
inherent tone pattern.
    The last example shows how tone is not only a lexical but a grammatical factor in Igbo.
It ean be scen clearly, also, in the tonal behaviour, for instance, of two nouns in genitival
relationship. ‘Two nouns which have high high tones lexically, tsi “head”? and eghu “‘goat’’,
have the tone pattern, isi eghu “goat’s head’, when they are in genitival relationship.
  Only in the verb are grammatical relations phonetically, or segmentally, expressed.
Elsewhere, and also in the verb except for its inflexional vowel prefix, grammatical relations
are expressed by tone and word order. This will become clear as the grammatical system of
the language is examined.
   There is also what may be called an intonational factor in Igbo. Certain minor modifications
of the grammatical tone patterns may at times be made for emotional reasons. Examples
will be found in the verb chapters.",[28]
"
Sentence Analysis into Clauses  If we look at our text we shall find a number of single clause sentences, that is to say, of
sentences containing only one verb form. Hach of these is a complete utterance. Sentence 10,
for instance, is an example, Mgbé dura ob? ojod na éme ywa & “The child was always sad”.
Sentence   19 is another, a       ékwe,   “They agreed”. Sentences          22, 36, 38, 40, 43, 53, 61, are
further examples.
   We shall also find many two clause sentences where division can only be into the clause
of complete utterance and the remaining clause. The immediate constituents are, in fact, at
once apparent. Thus sentence 2 divides into the clause of complete utterance, O mara mma
jke ukwu, and a co-ordinate clause, ‘tofitakwa madhy. Sentence 5 divides into the clause of
complete utterance, Ha dnaght ekwe, and a noun clause, ka ezi dt byara ya. Other examples
will be found in the text and in the chapter on clauses‘).
   We find, however, many sentences of more than two clauses. We start always by taking
the formally independent part of the sentence, the clause of complete utterance, as one part
at our first division. On the principle of dividing into as few parts as possible we take the
rest of the sentence as our second part whenever the clauses composing it are interdependent.
This is the case in sentences 18, 21, 35, 37 and 66 for example. If we look at 37 we see that it
divides into the clause of complete utterance (C.C. U.), Akika afzisia, and the rest of the   1) Except, of course, when a part of speech happens to consist of a single morpheme.

202                                      Green/Igwe,     Grammar of Igbosentence headed        by a co-ordinate clause, ‘si ka ha tagbuo ya. At the second division this
second part further subdivides into “si which, as we have said, is co-ordinate with the clause
of complete utterance, and into ka ha tagbuo ya, a noun clause after ‘s7. The order of consti-
tuents we thus get is:
  Akika afiisia si ka ha tagbuo ya
                   wt                       Ne
                           Noun    (obj.)
      CCL.         |          Co-ord.
   It should be noted that in sentence 18, at the third division, we are not able to divide into
two parts only but have to divide into three. The part of the sentence that we have, at this
stage, to subdivide is, — gwachaa ijere na mkpu na mirh ukwu dichiri n’uzd ahi ka ha ghara
ikweé nwa dghoghd ahi neéenweght nne na nnd gafée ka ha tagbuo yd. Here our first part is
gwachaa Vere nda mkpu nad mirl ukwu dichiri n’uzd ahh but we cannot take the whole of what
remains as our second part since it consists in two parts which are not formally dependent
on each other but which each depend on the first part. If either is omitted the other still
stands formally unimpaired in its relation to the first part. We thus have as our second and
third parts at this stage of division, ka ha ghara ikwé nwa agboghd ahi neenweght nne na nna
gafee, and ka ha tagbuo ya. These parts therefore appear in separate brackets"").
   In the same way, when we have a sentence in which the clause of complete utterance is
followed by several co-ordinate clauses we cannot divide into two parts, the clause of com-
plete utterance and the rest of the sentence, beause the latter consists in clauses which depend
not on cach other but on the first part. Each, therefore, is a separate part enclosed in its own
bracket. Sentence 45, for instance, would divide into the clause of complete utterance, Zyi
ésée, and into four following parts at this first stage of division, namely the four clauses co-
ordinate with the clause of complete utterance, ‘kporo ya, ‘ghumachaa ya ahu, were amma
ya and ‘ti ya n’ahu. All these are the immediate constituents of the sentence and, since none
of them happens to be further divisible, they are the ultimate constituents as well. If we
compare sentence 33 we shall see that the last co-ordinate clause part is further divisible
since it contains a noun clause, gawant.
   It remains to consider the adjectival clauses. These, as we know, have the limited behaviour
of adjectives in the sense that they occur only immediately after the nominal they qualify’).
Moreover they are so intimately bound up with the clause within the body of which they
occur that it is formally incomplete without them. In sentence 35, for instance, we divide
first into the clause of complete utterance, Ya érute ebe mkpu di, and the rest of the sentence,
si kit ya gafee. Each part is further divisible and at the second division we get, in the first
part, Ya érute ebe, in which, if it were formally complete, ebe would have a high mid tone
pattern, and the adjectival clause, mkpu di. In the second part we get si, and the noun object
clause, ka ya gafée. The order of constituents is thus:
                            Ya érute ebe    mkpu di | St | ka ya gafee | P                                                 Adj.   | Noun (obj.)      1                                        CxCous               Co-ord.","[221, 222]"

    Many suffixes can be used with the imperative, negative, either in place of -la or together
 with it. Examples are given below. The -ghi suffix does not appear to be used with this
 form. If, for instance, in the place of O st wnu ajila anu “He says you are not to refuse meat’,
 we had O si wunu ajught anu, the utterance would be interpreted as a question, ‘He says
 didn’t you refuse meat?’’ The form in the latter case would be Subject Verb Form I, main,
 negative. Both this and the imperative, negative, form could, in these two examples, be used
 unsuffixed, but only the context would show which form the speaker was intending. The
 exclusion of the -ghi suffix from the imperative, and the use of the -/a suffix, lessens the ambi-
 guity of the form,
 Examples with various suffixes:              The -la suffix is optional.
        O si anyi aladkwala                                  “He says we are not to go after all”

        O ar unk ka une aldawala                             “He sent word that you are not to set out”
        (V.h. with -wa suffix)
        O zirt ha ka ha evitele                              “He     sent word   that they should   not bring

      (V.h. with -ra [non-time] suffix)          impossible to take up any shares’.
   It should be noted that in the above paradigms and examples of indirect speech the meaning
 may be either past or present, according to the context. Thus, for instance, 0 si anyt alakwala
 “He says (said) we are (were) not to go”                                     2.

prefix!), we find in the negative form the ev verb stem and a harmonizing vowel prefix,
a-(e-), according to the stem vowel. It will, of course, be remembered that the prefix is never
present in any verb form when the subject of the verb is one of the inseparable pronouns.
     With noun subjects there is only one tonal form of Subject Verb Form I, main, negative.
In this the prefix is high, with the verb stem on a mid tone for high tone verbs and on a low
tone for low tone verbs, This high mid or high low tone pattern is typical of the negative
verb forms. Example: Via amd onye ontna (V.h.) “Sleep does not recognize a sorrowlul man”
(i. e. he sleeps all the same. Traditional Igbo saying).
    With pronoun subjects this same tone pattern of the verb is also found, with the pronoun
on a high tone or tones. Wxamples:               Anyi act akhu (V.h.) “We        are (were) not earrying (did
not carry) palm nuts”. 0 ci akhu “He is not (ete.) carrying palm nuts’’. This may be called
Tone Form i, It will be seen that with the inseparable pronoun of the second example the
form is ambiguous*).

      The morpheme constituents of this form are the cy verb stem with a harmonizing vowel
prefix, a-(e-), according to the stem vowel. The tone of the prefix is high. That of the verb
stem is mid for high tone verbs before an object but low if no object follows. It is low for low
tone verbs in cither case.
     Where      ambiguity might arise a suffix is added, the -la suffix being often used.         An extra
tone bearing syllable is thus provided such as is found in a compound verb, where ambi-
guity does not arise. Eyen when the meaning is clear without it the -/a suffix is often
used and seems to make little if any difference to the meaning of the form.
   Both separable and inseparable pronouns can be used as subject. The latter are only used
in direct speech and are usually preceded by the conjunction ka. With them the verb prefix is,
    of course, absent.
      This form, like the imperative, affirmative, can be used as a direct command and also in
    indirect speech. With the first person pronouns it usually has the force of a question.",[135]

Moreover its vowel harmonizes with the vowel of the preceding syllable not only in level but
in position. That is to say that a front vowel is followed by an open front one and a back
by an open back, in each case on the harmonizing level?). This can be simply illustrated by the
following table of the imperative form of the verb with this suffix.",[78]

usage and we shall give the paradigm of the low tone verb with one of the most usual
suffixes. But before doing this it is important to note that the tonal behaviour of the low tone
verb is affected by presence or absence of suffix, as is also the case with the Imperative
and with Subjeet Verb Form II, main. All three verb forms end on a high tone when a high
tone suffix is present, and tone group I noun objects have their non-inherent tones. This,
however, is not possible for N lh if the verb form ends on a low tone since its non-inherent
initial mid tone cannot oceur after a low tone'). But we find with Subject Verb Form TI,
subordinate, conditional, that when the verb is unsuffixed the verb stem takes a mid tone
before N lh, which can then follow with its non-inherent mid tone. It also takes a mid tone
before N ll. It is possible that on this occasion these two tone classes of noun fall together
in this respect beeause each has an inherent initial low tone. But the solidarity of tone group I
is none the less maintained by the fact that both have their non-inherent tones as objects
of this verb form?).
   We now give a series of paradigms and examples of Subject Verb Form I, subordinate, con-
ditional, suffixed or unsuffixed for the high tone verb and suffixed for the low tone verb.","[98, 99]"

   The tone of the auxiliary verb stem is low, The addition of the -ghi suffix is optional, but if
it is present it has a low tone. It does not affect the meaning. Pronoun subjects are also on
low tones, the separable pronouns being used. The tone of noun subjects is as for the non-

  With the low tone verb the verb prefix is found on a low tone instead of a high in some con-
structions after any) and unw. This may be a stylistic or an emotional alternative.
   In the paradigm above, the verb form in the first clause, throughout, is Subject Verb
Form I, subordinate, conditional. In the paradigm of the high tone verb above, on the con-
trary, it was Subject Verb Form I, subordinate, rel. B. Note how this difference affeets the
meaning of the second clause, which contains Subject Verb Form II, main, (non-initiating).
   The only inseparable pronoun used as subject with Subject Verb Form IT, main (non-
initiating) is the impersonal pronoun a, which has no separable form. It has, however, a low
tone here whereas with the initiating form it has a high tone.

 98                                     treen/Igwe,      Grammar      of Igbo    With the high tone verb it is unnecessary to give a further paradigm of the verb with high
 tone suffix, since suffix and verb stem are on the same level. But the situation of the low
 tone verb is rather more complex. As with the imperative and with Subject Verb Form I
subordinate,     conditional, we find that, with an object, the tonal behaviour of the unsuffixed
verb form is different from that of the verb form with suffix, ending on a high tone. In the
latter case, tone group I objects have their non-inherent tones. In the former this is not
possible for N. lh, with its non-inherent initial mid tone, so long as the verb form ends ona
low tone. But we find a modification of the tonal behaviour of the verb form when an object
follows. We therefore give paradigms, with and without suffix, with pronoun objects. We
also give noun objects for the unsuffixed verb. Noun objects with the suffixed verb, with both
high and low tone verbs, will be found for the initiating form, which is the same in this
respect as the non-initiating').","[116, 117, 118]"

   The morpheme constituents are the ev auxiliary radical followed by a non-auxiliary
participle.
   The tone of the radical is high before the participle of a high tone verb, and high falling
to low before that of a low tone verb. The tone patterns of these participles are as for Subject
Verb Form I, main, auxiliary.
   Like the non-auxiliary participle, the auxiliary is used after the auxiliary verb or after a
verb such as ¢ji or tgd used as an auxiliary. In the latter case the auxiliary participle may or
may not immediately follow the verb.",[191]

Consonants   Consonants are found as the initials of syllables of two “places’’, as we saw in Otita, “the
eating’. Nasal consonants can also, like vowels, be syllabic, as in mba, “town’’, or ntd, “small-
ness’’. In such eases they are usually homorganie with the following consonant. Syllabic nasal
consonants are occasionally found before y und w. We then underline them, as in nyo, “the
returning”, or in ywit, “clothes”. They are thus distinguished from the palatalized nasal,
ny, as in inyd okhu, “to warm oneself at the fire’, and from the labialized nasal, nw, as in
nwa, “child’’.
     Nasal consonants also occur in final position, as in dum,                ‘‘all”, and in many onomatopoeie
words, and are here also syllabic. Dui has two syllables, the open syllable dw, on a high tone,
and the syllabic nasal consonant 7 on a low tone.
     Nasal consonants also, like vowels, occur as independent syllables,                   as in M bhataran'uld.
“T came into the house.”
     Consonant harmony occurs in the sense that nasality may, in some instances, persist from
one syllable to another. This has been found in the case of certain of the suffixes when they
follow a verb stem of which the initial consonant is nasal or nasalized.                     Ex: o 7irti ulo “He
built a house.’’4) This we have noted for the suffixes with which it has been found and it is
not shown in our script.°) In the example given, the nasality of the 7 syllable persists in the
following one.
  The consonants can be conveniently grouped according to the following plan, which we
borrow from Mr. J. Carnochan.*) Their large number is hardly surprising when one realizes     1) See J. Carnochan,   ““A Study in the Phonology of an Igbo             Speaker’,   B. 8. 0. A. 8., Vol. XII,

    *) See p. 548q.
    ‘) We have dealt with some of the suffixes in common use in the chapter “‘Suffixes’’ and in the voea-
bulary, but our investigation is far from exhaustive. There may well, therefore, be nasality occuring
with suffixes we have not described from this point of view. The suffixes are lexical, not inflexional,
elements. See also p. 53 for compound verbs.
    ®) See J. Carnochan, op. cit., p. 421. In order, however, to keep as near as possible to the official ortho-
graphy used by the Education Department, we have maintained gh for the velar fricative and have
therefore used g/, for the voiced, aspirated, velar plosive. For the same reason. we have written ¢ in-
stead of ty for the unaspirated, and ch instead of thy for the aspirated, voiceless, palatalized, alveolar
plosives. We have also written j instead of dy for the unaspirated, and jh instead of dhy for the aspi-
rated, voiced, palatalized, alveolar plosives.

       The syllabary of Igbo consists, as has been said, in monosyllables which are composed either
    of a vowel, v, or a nasal consonant, n, or a consonant and vowel, ev. Each of the eight vowels
    occurs as a syllable as do the three simple nasal consonants. The consonant-vowel syllables
    which have been found are listed in the table which follows.
      The syllables are units of equal length, phonologically speaking. When one vowel follows
    another it constitutes a separate syllable, This becomes particularly clear when the tonology
    of the language is examined and it is seen that the two vowels carry distinct tonemes.","[22, 23, 24]"

      The second part of this grammar, headed ‘‘The Text’’, consists in a number of texts in
 which the grammatical system set out in the first part is shown in its deployment in speech.
 The system — la langue — is the store of potentialities, the armoury, from which actual speech
 — la parole — chooses its weapons.
   As examples of ‘‘the text’? we give six texts of different kinds and annotate them in differ-
 ent ways.
    Text I is a traditional story, an Igbo folk tale (ifé), of the kind told, in old custom, only at
 night and usually by moonlight'). It has a relatively simple narrative style. This text is
 analysed in terms of descending linguistic units, from more to less complex, from immediate
 to ultimate constituents.
    Text IT is a dialogue and therefore of a different style. The writer gives the conversation
of two women as they set out to market. Parts of it are annotated and certain types of gram-
matical relationship are pointed out which the analysis of Text I into a hierarchy of depen-
dencies ignored.
      Text III is a non-traditional narrative of a descriptive kind taken from a recent unpublished
essay, Each verb form is annotated.
   Text IV is another dialogue, the writer giving a mother and her children talking as they
prepare for market. Here again all the verb forms are annotated and serve as contextualised
examples for the verb chapters of Part I.
   Text V is an example of the language used in translation, and stretching itself, as any
language must, in the effort to convey a foreign idiom.
  Text VI is a short collection of traditional proverbs and riddles). They contain forms and
formulae less frequently found in the speech of every day life. Their use, moreover, of ono-
matopoeia, is apparent.","[215, 216, 217]"
"     With interrogative emphatic force we also find the separable pronouns as subject of Sub-
ject Verb    Form I, main, where in normal, unemphatic                 usage the inseparable singular pro-
nouns would be used. Thus, in answer to the accusation Agj méré ya. “You did it” willcome
Mi     méré ya?    “TI did it?”, The pronouns are on high tones throughout,                both monosyllabic
and disyllabie.
  As with other parts of speech, the grammatical relations of the pronouns are expressed by
tone and word order.
   Pronouns oceur in many of the same syntactical situations as nouns. The tonal behaviour
of the disyllabic pronouns is, however,        distinct from that of the disyllabic nouns.
     It has already been noted as a distinguishing factor between pronouns and other nominals
that only a pronoun, on a low tone, can be the subject of a question form of the verb?).
     Pronouns as subject and object of the verb are set out in the verb chapters, where it is
seen that the subject is an integral part of the verb form in the Subject Verb Forms. Pro-
nouns in their other grammatical relations are set out below, together with a note on the
two forms of the first person singular and the third person plural pronouns as subject of the
verb, which are more suitably dealt with here than in the verb chapters.",[53]
"                                6) Subject    Verb    Form        I, Subordinate, Relative B
   The morpheme constituent is the cv verb stem.
   It is on a low tone for both high and low tone verbs. But whereas the main form, except
with the inseparable, singular pronouns, required a low tone to precede it, this form requires
a high one. Pronoun subjects are on high tones. Noun subjects of tone group I keep their
 88                                        Green/Igwe, Grammar of Igho inherent tones and those of tone group II have non-inherent tones in which their final syl-
 lable is high relatively to the tone of the verb. The tonal behaviour of noun subjects is thus
 the reverse of that for the main form. In the main                 form, for instance, we had, Egh@             riri ji
 “The goat ate the yams’. In this form we have, Ji eghu riri hyirt nne                             “The yams        the
 goat ate were many’.
    This example also shows how the syntactical behaviour of this form differs from that of
 the main. It shows, too, one of its frequent usages, in a clause of incomplete utterance
 qualifying a preceding nominal. It is also used, however, in clauses of incomplete utterance
 introduced by certain conjunctions.
      Tt is used both with and without suffixes.","[107, 108]"

 Note on the Table of Syllables      The vowels e and o are sometimes used interchangeably by different individual speakers,
 as in the verb thkhwe (ikhwo) “to take account of’’, or in the noun           ywokhé (nwokho)      “man”.
 'This is also the case, in some instances, with w and 9, as in the verb inwé (inwo) “to shine”.
     The same thing occurs with the consonants hw and h in some cases, as in the verb ihwi
 (thu) “to see”, “to roast’. Hw appears to be “deep” Qhwuhwy Qhuhu) and h more general.
 In the table brackets are used as in this note.
     In the table we record the syllables si, sz, 5%, 52, 27, zi, 21; and syi, syn, Syt, dyt, zyt, Zyl, Zyt.
But as the first, unpalatalized sect has only been found rarely, and as prefixal elements before
an open vowel radical, as in istsé “the carrying by hand’’, we keep in line with the present
orthography of the Education Department, by writing s and z throughout the book for
both the palatalized and the unpalatalized sibilants.
   Syllables in heavy type in the tables have been found as verb stems. Those not followed by
a number have been found as the stems of both high and low tone verbs. Those numbered 1
have been found as the stems of high toneverbs only, and those numbered 2 as stems of low
tone verbs only. Wordsin the right hand columm contain syllables not found as verb stems,
Syllables which are neither in heavy type nor given in the right hand column are usually deriva-
tional prefixes, as, for instance, in verbal nouns of action.","[24, 25, 26]"

   This form is, as we have said, used in the body of a narrative discourse, where it may stand
alone and where the equivalent clause in English would often begin with “And—""’. But more
often it occurs in a multiclausal sentence, introduced by, or accompanying, another clause.
 96                                    treen/Igwe,     Grammar of Igbo    The wide range of time meanings of this form, according to the constructions in which it
 oceurs and the suffixes it uses, can be judged from the examples and from the texts.It often
 has the same past time meaning as Subject Verb Form I, main, with the -ra (time) suffix,
 and is sometimes interchangeable with it. But on the whole, forms I and II are used in dif-
 ferent types of construction even though the same time meaning may he required.
    Just as we found the initiating form chiefly in the conversational texts, so we find the non-
 initiating in the connected stories, though it is used in conversation too. It is found with many
suffixes but not -ra(time). It does not have the exclamatory usage of the initiating form when
the -la suffix is absent. It is one of the most frequently used of the verb forms and it is es-
sential to study carefully, particularly in the texts, the constructions in which it occurs,
if one is to have any appreciation of Igbo idiom.
      Except with pronoun subjects the paradigms for the non-initiating usage are the same as
for the initiating. They are therefore given under one or other of the two headings but not
under     both.","[115, 116]"
"Examples:
      Ka m ga rity ihye fita!                             “Let me go and eat something and come out!”’
      (V.h.)                                              (Text II, sent. 15)
      Ka m vuru abo m enyr m!                             “Let me pick up my basket, my friend!”
      (V. h. with -ra(non-time) suffix)                   (Text IT. sent, 24)
      Ka m ta!                                            “Let me go!” (a form of leave taking)
      (V.h.)
      Anyi la!                                            “Let us go!”    (a form    of leave taking)
      (V.h.)
                           Here ka could precede and would add formality or a sense of pleading. But with
                           any? it usually seems to be omitted.       (a o nddi odhi                                  “Let him sit down”
      (V.1. with -d? suffix)
      Anyi zda uld                                        “Let us sweep the house!”
      (V. 1. with open vowel suffix)
This verb form can also be preceded by mé in complete, but linked, utterance. If someone,
for instance, says that they are going to do something and someone else asks, Mgbe dle?
“When?’’, the first speaker could reply, Ma anyi la “When we get home”. Again this com-
plete utterance usage is restricted by the presence of a conjunction.
                            y) Subject Verb Form I, Subordinate, Relative A   In this form the unprefixed verb stem, whether for high or low tone verbs, is on a mid tone
in relation to its pronoun or noun subjects. The latter thus never end on a low tone. If they
did so they could not precede a mid tone. Noun subjects of tone group IT have a non-inherent
tone pattern.   Noun objects of tone group I have non-inherent tones.
    It will be noted     that in the examples which follow, the subject of the relative A verb
form is to be found in the accompanying           clause.
   Both relative Aand B are frequently used verb forms. Like other subordinate forms they
are largely contextualised by the main forms with which they occur.
   Many suffixes, including the -ra(time), can be used with Subject Verb Form I, relative A.",[105]

(obj.)Analysis of Parts of Speech into Morphemes  In our analysis of words, or parts of speech, into their constituent morphemes, or minima]
signs, we apply the same principles and diagrams as to multiclausal sentences and clauses,
in so far as they are applicable at this level. We shall find, however, many words which we
        208                                         Green/Igwe, Grammar of Igbo        are unable to analyse into smaller parts. This may be because they already consist of only
        one morpheme but alternatively it may be because we lack the requisite knowledge to break
        them up. We believe that we have identified the inflexional morphemes and this enables us
        to analyse the verb forms. But there may be many nominals which are susceptible of analysis
        but which we have to leave undivided because we have not identified the derivational and
        radical morphemes of which they are composed. It must therefore not be assumed that all
        words left undivided are unanalysable.
           Many words, such for instance as mara, mma, ako, uce, contain only two morphemes and
        thus no problem of levels of division arises since there is only one level in question. The parts
        have simply to be identified. This can be done for the above nouns, mma, ako, and ucé and
        for ez, if0, nri and so on, because              we know    the verbs     with   which    they are cognate. With
        um    “children”, we see that the radical is on a low tone whereas the verb imu “‘to give birth
        to”, is a high tone verb. But we know that this shifting of the tone of the radical does some-
        times occur in cognates.            cp. igwh egwu “to play”, where the tonal shift is present though
        reversed, being high on the noun base of the noun cognate with a low tone verb.
           When, however, more than two morphemes are present, we proceed as in the sentence and
        clause analysis, by dividing that which is dependent and that on which it depends. We can
        divide into two parts only, at the first division, in a word like anaghi, in sentence 5, where the
        inflexional prefix and the verb stem can stand without the lexical suffix ghi, and are thus one
        part at the first divison. But with a word like tofatakwa, in sentence 2, where three compound-
        ing elements — a verb stem and two suffixes — are present in addition to the initial radical,
        more than two parts will be necessary at the first division.
          As in the sentence and clause analysis, the independent part is left unbracketed at each
    level of division             and the   other part, or parts,    are bracketed.      At   the first level of division,
    however, the unbracketed part is, as before, underlined with a dotted line for convenience
    of identification in the diagrams. Only analysable words are included in the following diagram.","[226, 227, 228]"

                                                         Adjectives
   There is, in Igbo, a small class of words which may conveniently be called adjectives!).
   The following have so far been found.
    1. Those with a cognate verb. Their morpheme constituents are a dcrivational vowel prefix,
g-, a cv radical, and, in one instance, a derivational vowel suffix, -0.
   The tones are high high or high high mid.
   oma      “good, beautiful”            Cognate with ima ‘“‘to be good”
   ocha     “white, clean”’               Cognate with icha “to change colour”
   oj0, ojod     “bad”                                   Cognate with ij¢ ‘‘to be bad”
   2. Those with no cognate verb, so far as appears, but with other cognates. Their syllabic
components are cy-n, ev-v-cv (nv-v-cy).
  The tones are high low, high low low, high mid level.
  dum       all”                         Cognate with the noun di                          “fulness” and with
                                                          udumiri “wet season” (lit. “fulness of water’’)
   ladwo (dialectal variant, nadbo)
             “two, both”’                                Cognate with abuo “two”
   litle (dialectal variant, nite)
               ‘aut                                      Possibly cognate with dle? “how many ?’”*)
   3. The demonstrative adjectives, with syllabic components v, v-ev, and tones low and high
low, and distinguished from the foregoing groups by a slight difference in syntactical behav-
jour.
   a         “this”
   ahi       “that”
          naa may be added to both the above for emphasis.
  4. Two       ev monosyllables,        which   cannot     be said to have   a lexical tone since, like all the
adjectives, they do not occur in isolation, and, unlike the other adjectives, their tone varies
according to the tone of the preceding syllable.
   wa        “the, that’’ (i. e. of which we have already spoken). Used only after a noun, or
             adjective qualifying a noun,
  ma             Used only after a pronoun, to give emphasis.
   The adjectives are distinguished from the other parts of speech both by their tonal and
syntactical behaviour. They are only found immediately following a noun, pronoun or other
adjective. If a noun qualified by a pronoun is also qualified by an adjective, the adjectives
of the first two groups can either precede or follow the pronoun. The demonstratives follow
the pronoun.
   1) A few words have         been found which behave sometimes like adjectives sometimes          like nouns.
Example    ukwu    “bigness,    big”.

                                                      1. Nouns
  In the syllabary of Igbo we saw that nearly all ev syllables could appear as verb stems. We
can speak of them as radical elements in contrast to the inflexional vowel prefix by which, in
many verb forms, they are preceded.
  These radical elements also appear in nouns and in some of the few adjectives that have
been found in Igbo. We thus find what may be called cognate clusters,with the nomino-verbal
infinitive form of a verb and, of course, all the accompanying verb forms, and a number
of nouns of various types of formation and sometimes an adjective. We give examples of one
or two such clusters, the list of members not necessarily being exhaustive.",[33]

                                   resume their inherent tones, and in texts it is more                   convenient   to write
                                   them with these. See p. 88, note 2.
                                   It will be seen from the above examples that this question form can be
                                   used both in questions which expect an answer ‘‘Yes’’ or “‘No’’, and in que-
                                   stions   with   a non-initial    interrogative   word    such    as gini.   Further    examples
                                   of the    latter   type are     given   in the chapter     on    Interrogatives.
   b) In indirect questions:
       Example:
       Jioro m ya ma & zuulaara rir hye                              “Ask him       whether he bought              me     what     I
       m sere ya (V.h.)                                              ordered through him”
   c) In an “if” clause, preceded by ma when the clause is not initial. When                                    it is initial ma
      is usually absent.
       Examples:            V.h.
           Anyi tard akhu ‘unk garda imata                         = “Tf we ate nuts you would know‘‘?)

would know.” This use of a question form where it is not intended to have question force is said some-
times to be a source of confusion to interpreters.

            The mid tone level of the pronoun ya is important here. If it were on the same level
         as the preceding syllable, thute would be taken as the negative narrative form!).

    and -wa suffixes)
              Here it will be noted that a narrative form follows S. V. F. if, main, and is itself
         followed by another narrative on a heightened tone level after its own final high
         syllable. It does not itself have any heightening because its initial high tone syllabe
         ga- follows the preceding low tone syllable -/x.
    Aa dlaa, ‘ga gwa nna ha ukwu ihye ha “They went home and told their master what
    hid                                  they had seen” (Text I, sent. 56)
     (V.h. and V.h.)
           Note that here there is no “higher than high” tone level for the second narrative,
         gua.    The same thing can be seen in sentence 66 of this text, where gwa follows another
         verb of motion, bya, and where again the close connection between the action expres-
         sed by the two narratives appears to be shown by their level tones. Suffix behaviour
         in other, comparable forms suggests, however, that ga gwa- and bya gwa- in these
         examples are not to be regarded as compound verbs.

       close vowel and -ra (non-time) suffixes)   It will be seen from the foregoing examples that tone group I noun objects have their non-
inherent tones. This, and the tonal behaviour of the pronoun objets, is at times all that
distinguishes the affirmative from the negative forms. The examples above may be compared
with those given later for the negative form.
  The narrative form usually follows another clause but it can also, and particularly in the
formula Di ka where it is followed by a conjunction, have an initial position. Example: Di
ka kwa ndi Igbo, ndi England nwere asisyu dt iché che “Like the Igbo people also, the English
people have different dialects’ (G, E. Igwe, “Othu Aghwmaghu Sir Too n'England’’, p. 5).
In the same way such forms as site and mara are found in initial position. And we find firi
in the 19bd saying Tiri ywit tirt agbagha, wwe dikwa            pga o dj “Put on clothes put on shoes,
the world is still where it is” (i.e. dressing up does not remove one’s difficulties).

   In clause analysis it is the verb which appears to be formally independent. A clause may
consist in a verb alone, as in the second clause of sentence 25, ghuwa, or the second clause of
sentences 67, gaa, and 68 luwa. At the first division, therefore, we divide into the verb and
that part or parts which are dependent on it*). If any part is further divisible we subdivide
it at the next level, and so on until no further division is possible. We again use the method
of simplest substitution and also of recognition of phrasal units.
    As between preposition and noun we consider the noun as dependent. Paradigmatically —
i. e. in tone class N hh-m — the noun has non-inherent tones following tho preposition.
    Conjunctions are ringed either as being interclausal or as not introducing a dependence.
This is paralleled in its first instanee, at sentence level, where conjunctions join two
   1) When the verb has « subject it is difficult to decide which depends on which. But it seems best to
regard the subject as depending on the verb. Its tonal behaviour is modified according to the verb form
in which it oceurs, which               is one, though not necessarily a conclusive,                                      factor in our decision.

   In the labels of bracketed parts, the heading, as of “Noun” in “Noun (obj.) Phrase”’ refers
to the part of speech dependent at that level, and the bracketed word to the nature of the
dependence. It will be observed that the description “Post-conjunctional” is not enclosed in
brackets as it does not indicate a dependence. The conjunction is regarded as a’ link’).
  It should be noted as a characteristic of subordinate, relative A, Subject Verb Forms, that
the subject of the verb is to be found in the preceding clansc, where it may also be the subject
of that clause but, alternatively, may                            often be the object. In clause                               1b the subject of the
verb is in clause La, where it is the object of the verb in that clause. The same situation is
found    in sentences 6 and                 12.","[224, 225, 226]"
