"Examples (372) and (373) show that to with intransitive verbs results in a
pseudo-transitive clause (te 'PAST' cooccurs with subject agreement prefixes,
see sect. 1.3).
(2) There is a sub-class of verbs which have stems that are inherently neutral
and which may be formed into either transitive or intransitive stems through
morphophonological processes. This is explained in sect. 23.
18.6 Modifier.     Adjectival verbs occur in their uninflected forms as modifiers
of other (inflected) verbs (see sect. 15.3 for a similar modifier function in
noun phrases):        ihcuran pej           '(someone) killed it well'
        intoj pej             'he jumped well'
        ihkin hi              'he stopped liking'
        ihkrer jicu           'he stopped eating'
19 Adjective phrase structure
   The possible combinations of modifier sequences in noun phrases are
discussed in sect. 15.3. Both adjectives (in noun phrases) and adjectival verbs
can be followed by the suffixes // 'augmentative' and re 'diminutive'. The
suffixes primarily modify the adjective/verb but in the case of re the noun is
often modified as well.
(374)   rop ita      im-pej- ti
        dog DEM 3- good-AUG
        'This dog is very good.'",[60]
"
1.2 Stative transitive. This is a special form of transitive, directly related to
the Stative clause (see sect. 1.5). It has most of the formal characteristics
described above for transitive clauses, including the same word order, object
noun phrase or verb prefix, and subject noun phrase or prefix. In this case,
however, the postposition (to which the subject prefix may attach) can be
either te or m . When te occurs it carries the meaning 'habitual state' not 'past
tense' as in the non-stative transitive clauses. When m occurs it means
'temporary state'. Both te and m occur with the same meanings in simple
stative clauses (sect. 1.5). Free pronoun subjects do not cooccur with the
prefixed te and ma.

15 Noun phrase structure
15.1 Marking for case.          There are several morphological ways for
distinguishing the syntactic and semantic functions of noun phrases. Peripheral
clause constituents with noun phrases have one of the set of postpositions
described in sect. 17, representing various semantic distinctions. Certain
occurrences of subject also require specific postpositions.
   The subject of verbs denoting feelings such as fear, hunger, attraction, lust,
cold, etc. is marked by one of two postpositions: mä indicates 'temporary
state' and te 'habitual state'.
(244)   i-mä              kry
        1-TEMPRY          cold
        'I'm cold.'
(245)   rop ita      mä            hüpa
        dog this TEMPRY 3+fear
        'This dog is afraid of it.'
(246)   cu-mä           a-kin
        3- TEMPRY       2-like
        'He likes you.'
(247)   cu-te      pram
        3- HAB hungry
        'He is habitually hungry.'
(248)   capi te        ho      ita   xen
        Capi HAB food this lust
        'Capi lusts for this food habitually.'
(249)   i-te        hüpa
        1-HAB 3+fear
            live afraid of it.'","[39, 40]"
"  When the context is very specific as in the case of responses to questions,
even the verb phrase can be omitted.
(83)    jü kam ca te? pur         wyr
        where    2 go? field to
        'Where are you going? To the field.'",[13]
"   (Numerals and quantifiers like crere 'few' act like verbs and always require
to be separated from another verb by ne 'and').
  Equation is treated by linking the two nouns in a coordinate noun phrase
which is both the subject of a main clause in which the verb is ipipen 'be
equal' and of a subordinate clause which contains the attribute or action being
compared. In the case of an active verb, the subordinator is to. Within context
the attribute can be omitted.
(112)   capi me kryt cati         pipen
        Capi and Kryt big         equal
        'Capi and Kryt are equally big.'

   The Ramkokamekra Canela are part of the Je linguistic family, spoken on
the great central plateau of Brazil. Other Je-speaking people include the
Timbira, Apinaje, Xerente, Xavante and Kajapo, located mosdy south west of
the Canela (Nimuendaju 1946, Crocker 1961).
  The Canela language is spoken with minimal dialect variations by three
separate groups. The Ramkokamekra Canela live in a village of about 800
people about 50 miles south of Barra do Corda, Maranhäo. About 350
Apanjekra Canela live 30 miles west of the Ramkokamekra Canela village.
Some social interaction occurs, and there have been a few cases of
intermarriage. The language is also spoken by the 900 Kraho of Northern
Goias, over 200 miles south west of the two Canela villages. There has been
no social interaction to speak of in recent years between the Kraho and the
Canela villages.
  The total number of speakers is thus around 2000. Bilingualism and
acculturation vary from village to village as well as between age groups and
between sexes. Generally die most bilingual are the young men in their teens
and early twenties. In the Ramkokamekra village at least 70 people can read
and write, at least to some extent, in Portuguese and in Canela. There has
been extensive contact for over 50 years with the surrounding Portuguese
speaking Brazilian population. The Canela-Kraho have, however, been able to
preserve their culture and life style, customs and language, to a remarkable
degree. Although both bilingualism and acculturation are increasing in all
locations, thus far the changes are relatively small. Both groups appear to be
growing economically dependent on the government.",[1]
"Vocalic release of consonants
   All consonants, except kft(k), ts(x), rj(g) and h(h) have a vocalic release
utterance final, and in some dialects also utterance medial. The occurrence and
strength of this release varies and fluctuates freely between dialects. The
quality and occurrence of the release are predictable: v(w) and y(j) syllable
final always occur with release, the quality of which is as follows:
   v(w) has a low central vowel quality [a];
   y(j) has a high front vowel quality [i], except when the y(j) follows i in
which case its release has a low central vowel quality [a].
   All other consonants have a release which has the quality of the preceding
vowel, except when the vowel is a, in which case it releases into a high front
vowel, [i]. None of these releases are written in the practical orthography.
   Long vowels contrast with short vowels, but their occurrence is fairly rare,
and in the practical orthography vowel length is written only when it is the
only distinguishing feature between two otherwise identical words:        ma 'benefactive' and mää 'rhea'
        caxwa 'night' and caaxwa 'salt'
        pe 'DP' and pee 'until'
        te 'PAST' and tee 'in vain'Intonation patterns
  Some common intonation patterns are illustrated below.",[63]

134                                  Jack and Jo Popjes1.7 Equational.     The equational clause consists of a subject and a
complement. The subject may be a noun phrase or a demonstrative. The
complement is a noun phrase.
(40)    ita    ken
        DEM stone
        ""This is a stone.'
(41)    ata-je      ankrare
        DEM-PL      children
        'Those are children.'

        field    1-   possession
        ""The field is mine.'
(43)    ita     i-pur
        DEM 1-field
        ""This is my field.'
1.8 Identifications!!. The identificational clause also consists of subject and
complement, but in this case there is a relator postposition pe, which functions
as a copula. It follows the subject, which may be a noun phrase or a prefix
attached to pe. The complement is a noun phrase.
(44)    capi pe        mehi
        Capi COP       Indian
        'Capi is an Indian.'
(45)    i-pe   capi

        2<X>P      rich     NOMLZR
        'You are a rich person.'","[6, 7]"
"  The plural free form me with the third person automatically refers to animate
beings in general, to human beings more specifically, and most specifically to
Indians:        ihcunea       'all of it'
        ken cunea     'all the stones'
        mehcunea (me ihcunea) 'all the Indians/people/animate beings'
16.2 Demonstrative pronouns:        ita         'this'                   ata          'that'
        itaje       'these'                  ataje        'those'They may be used both independently and adjectivally:
(321)   ita   pi                            (322)       pi     ita
        DEM wood                                        wood DEM
        This is wood.'                                  'this wood'
(323)   ataje   ken                         (324)       ken      ataje
        DEM stone                                       stone    DEM
        'Those are stones.'                             'those stones'  These demonstrative pronouns are also used to indicate previous reference in
discourse. In this case the demonstrative pronoun is used in conjunction with
some sort of relator. The following examples refer to previous statements in
the discourse:        ita na                   'in reference to this'
        ita cwyrjape             'because of this'

        Because of this he will have plenty of food.'
16.3 Reflexive and reciprocal pronouns                  (see sect. 4):        amji and ajpen respectively
16.4 Interrogative pronouns           (see sect. 10):        jam       'who, singular'
        jümje     'who, plural'
        ampo      'what'
16.5 Relative pronouns.         These take the form of demonstratives and are
described in sect. 15.3.
17 Adpositional phrase structure
   The language is postpositional.
   Postpositions are not normally separated from the noun phrase although some
rare irregular occurrences have been noted. They cannot occur as independent
forms.
   Postpositions relate to people, things, actions and locations. Below they are
listed in the third person inflected form, with a hyphen separating the third
person prefix from the stem (0 indicates a zero third person marker):        cu-ma      'for, to, for his benefit' (benefactive)
        cu-pe      'from, to his loss, to his negative benefit'
                     (malefactive)
        cu-ri      'there' (locative)
        cu-rum     'toward there' (directional)
        cu-mam     'before it'
        cu-na      'in front of it'
        cu-te      'he' (transitive past tense, or stative
                     habitual)
        ih-kot     'after it'
        ih-        'from there' (locational source)
        ah-na      'about it'

subject (ha fluctuates between dialects with kra).

"                SYNTAX OF THE SENTENCE OR CLAUSE
1 Word order
   There are 10 clause types: six verbal clause types and four non-verbal. They
are distinguished on the basis of their obligatory constituents. In the listing that
follows, the constituents appear in their normal, unmarked order. Following the
discussion of the ten clause types (sects. 1.1 - 1.10), there is a summary of
basic word order patterns (sect. 1.11) and a description of peripheral clause
constituents (sect. 1.12).
1.1 Transitive. Differences between this clause type and the other types are
most clearly seen in the past tense forms. The clause nucleus consists of a                      Brought to you by | Massachusetts Institute of Technology - MIT Libraries

either a pronoun, a noun phrase or a prefix attached to the past indicative
tense marker te. (See sect. 16 for free and bound pronouns).
   If the subject is a noun phrase, the tense marker te occurs immediately
following it, without a prefix. The object may be a noun phrase or a person
prefix bound to the verb. There is one subgroup of transitive verbs where the
object in the third person is not overtly marked by a prefix. The long form of
the verb occurs with the past tense. (See sect. 23). The examples that follow
include some with present and future tenses also.(1)     wapo te         i-xec
        knife   PAST 1-cut
        'The knife cut me.'
(2)     co he!      que ha       wapo a-xec
        warning     3    PUT knife       2-cut
        'Careful, the knife will cut you!'","[1, 2]"
"   Elsewhere, the subject is not morphologically marked, and the direct object
is also not marked. The syntactic function of noun phrases is distinguished
primarily by word order (sect. 1).
15.2 Genitives. Nouns are divided into two classes:
   a) Inalienably possessed nouns occur with obligatory possessor person
prefixes or free form nominal possessors. Most of these nouns denote body
parts or kinship relationships. For possessor prefix forms, see sect. 16.
   In inalienably possessed noun phrases, the possessor is followed directly by
the possessed.

        'this dog'
(270)   hümre ata-je
        man     that-PL
        'those men'  c) with specifiers, where both the specifier and the specified are nouns. The
specifier is followed by the specified item, which is a more generic term.
(271)   prin    par
        piqui   tree
        ' ""piqui"" tree'
(272)   crow      kd
        burity    grove
        ' ""burity"" grove'   There is a subtype of the specifier noun phrase in which the specifier is
linked to the specified item by the postposition te. The relationship to the
specified item is to specify the material out of which the specified item is
made.

relative clause (276) or precedes it (277). The relative clause may be
extraposed, as in (277). The relative clause is signalled by an obligatory
demonstrative (ita, ata, etc.) occurring after it. This demonstrative functions as
a relative pronoun corresponding to the head noun. There are no restrictions on
the syntactic function of the head noun.

correspond to any of the above ways of nominalizing. The verb in its long

as its normal active verb meaning. It then carries the meaning of an act done

16 Pronoun system
  The pronoun system has both bound and free definite personal pronouns.
There are also indefinite personal pronouns which differentiate between
specific, non-specific, negative indefinite and plural. There are also
demonstrative, reflexive and reciprocal pronouns.","[46, 47]"

   I do not know of any constraints on the types of noun phrases that may be
coordinated. Thus, a simple noun and a complex nominalized clause can be
linked by the conjunction me 'and':

        'Jaco and the chiefs followers saw a deer.'
9 Pragmatic and discourse characteristks
    In other parts of this paper there is discussion of a number of discourse-
conditioned phenomena: ellipsis and dummy verb (sect. 3), various types of
anaphora (sect. 13), free form pronouns used for emphasis (sect. 16), certain
anaphoric uses of demonstratives and cooccurring postpositions (sect. 16), and
the fronting and left-dislocation of the direct object, with cooccurrence of a
pronominal copy prefixed to the verb, for purpose of focus and emphasis (sect.
 1).
   Here I discuss ways in which foregrounding and backgrounding is
distinguished in Canela narrative discourse. These terms, for the two principal
types of discourse information, are used here in much the same way as by
Hopper and Thompson (1980) and many others: foregrounding consists of main
events that are important to the narrator's purpose, whereas backgrounding
includes both events and nonevents that generally support the foregrounded
material but are not themselves part of the main thread of the discourse, e.g.
setting, evaluation, description, reference to custom, flashback, recapitulation.
   The two types of information are distinguished primarily by contrasting
aspect particles and past tense markers, and the (irregular) use of the long
form of verbs (foregrounded) and the short form of verbs (backgrounded).
Customary/habitual aspect is marked by hot pe (foregrounded) and ajco
(backgrounded). The regular past tense form te ('recent' in sect. 18.1) is used
in foregrounded, and a special form pe 'DISTANT PAST' in backgrounded,
sections of the discourse. The long form of the verb is used in foregrounded
clauses even when it occurs clause final, thus over-riding the usual syntactic
conditioning (see sect. 23). The short form of the verb is found in
backgrounded clauses, except when the continuative aspect particles apu and
ame occur.
   Two examples are given below to show contrasting foregrounded and
backgrounded sequences from two texts. Single parentheses signal
foregrounding, and square brackets backgrounding (the specific devices are thus
marked in the Canela, and the whole sections in the English translation):                     Brought to you by | Massachusetts Institute of Technology - MIT Libraries

   A noun or coordinate noun may be followed by up to three modifiers of
different types. The usual limit is two modifiers.

1.4 Intransitive.     The clause nucleus consists of a subject and a verb. The
subject may be a free subject pronoun, a noun phrase, or a person marker
prefixed to the verb. With the majority of intransitive verbs, the long form of
the verb (see sect. 23) occurs in the past tense, and the subject is prefixed to
the verb, unless it is a noun phrase. With a small sub-class of irregular
intransitive verbs, the long form of the verb does not occur in the past tense
unless the verb is non-final in the verb phrase. When the short form of the
verb occurs, the subject may be a free pronoun or noun phrase.

5 Passives
  There are no passive constructions.
6 Causatives
  Any verb can be made causative by the use of the transitive verb to I ton
'make/do'. The verb to be made causative is placed in a subordinate clause,
which is marked as such by the postposition na, and which immediately
precedes the causative verb.
  The direct object of the causative verb agrees with the subject of the verb in
the subordinate clause. In the case of the third person, the direct object marker                     Brought to you by | Massachusetts Institute of Technology - MIT Libraries

7 Comparatives and equatives
  Comparatives are expressed by means of postpositional phrases. Equatives
and similitives are expressed by verbal predications.
  Comparison is expressed by two postpositions which follow the standard of
comparison. They are hirö pe 'more than', and hapyre mä 'less than'.
  The subject or item to be compared occurs clause initial and it is followed
by the standard of comparison, which is followed by the postposition, followed
by the rest of the clause.
(104)   jaco     capi jiro    pe            cati
        Jaco     Capi more than             big
        'Jaco is bigger than Capi.'
(105)   capi kryt jiro       pe    hi                to          in-toj
        Capi Kryt more than body                     DMST        3- jump

        Kryt Jaco       less     than           3- small
        'Kryt is smaller than Jaco.'","[14, 15, 16]"
"  The following types of indefinite pronoun occur:   - specific indefinites: the free forms jurn 'someone' and ampo 'something'.
These forms are also used as interrogative pronouns, with the meanings 'who'
and 'what' respectively (sect. 10).
(317)   j m        j pen       x
        someone work           NOMLZR
        'someone's work'
(318)   i-te    ampo                   pupun
        1-PAST  something              see
        Ί saw something.'",[49]
"  The English gloss 'has/have' may be misleading-the emphasis in Canela is
not on possession but on existence or availability.
1.10 Temporal.      The temporal clause consists of a single uninflected word.
(57)    awa
        night
        'It is night.'",[8]
"   A system of personal pronouns is also used as a means of anaphoric
reference. Complete lists of free and bound form are given in sect. 16. The
reflexive and reciprocal pronouns amji and ajpen (described in sect. 4) are also
a means of anaphoric reference.
(226)   capi te        amji        cakwin
        Capi PAST self             hit
        'Capi hit himself.'

        Jaco PAST deer see             and self     for                   3 -kill
        'Jaco saw the deer and killed it for himself.'
(229)   capi te         po     curan,    que    ha                    cuku
        Capi PAST deer kill              3      PUT                   3+eat
        'Capi killed the deer and will eat it.'

        Capi PAST deer kill              3- eat                   NOMLZR PURP
        'Capi killed the deer for food.'",[36]
"   In the second or following clauses the subject and object free forms can be
omitted if they are the same in both clauses. In transitive clauses the subject-
tense relator te is omitted. The verb and the verb phrase level subject marker
apu 'CONTINUATIVE', cannot be omitted. Verb prefixes may not be omitted.
8.2 Phrase coordination. Nouns may be coordinated into noun phrases with
two or more heads linked by the conjunction me, which is phonologically
linked to the head preceding it.
(148)   wa apu pöhy            tepti       me, kwyr               jakare        me, aryjhy

        kre
        plant
        'I'm planting red corn, white manioc and rice.'
(149)   capi me kryt ma          te
        Capi and Kryt away go
        'Capi and Kryt go away.'",[23]
"  The negator affects the form of the verb in that it may be preceded only by
the long form (see sect. 23). Any constituent may be negated, subject, object,
indirect object, verb or any of the peripheral constituents, and the negator
usually follows the constituent to which it refers. Any word may be negated:
verbs, nouns, including nominalized verbs, pronouns, aspect or manner
markers, etc. When constituents which are marked by a postposition are
negated, the negator most commonly follows the postposition:
(205)   hyrmä     nare
        to him NEG
        'not to him, not in his direction'
(206)   kri         kam nare
        village     in     NEG
        'not in the village'
(207)   mehi      nare
        Indian    NEG
        'not an Indian'
(208)   ihkanhoc to            hahkre cate  nare
        book       INST        teach NOMLZR NEG
        'not a teacher'
(209)   ahtüm nare
        later    NEG
        'short time (not a long time)'

reflect a subtle distinction in meaning.
   In a sentence the non-verbal constituents are commonly negated by placing
them clause initial and then negating the verb. Compare the normal order of
the positive statement (210) with the corresponding negative statement in which
the focus of the negation is on the instrument phrase (211):
(210)   wa ha       catöc   to      po               cura
        1 PUT gun            INST deer               kill
          will kill the deer with a gun.'
(211)   catöc    to       wa ha      po     curan                nare
        gun      INST     1 PUT deer kill                        MEG
           won't kill the deer with a gun.'","[33, 34]"
"   The word incwyrjape 'reason', can be used with two distinct intonation
patterns (see sect. 22): in one, it is phonologically a part of the preceding
clause and functions like a subordinator; and in the other it is phonologically
bound to the clause which follows, functioning more like a sentence
connective.
(234)   i-mä             hüpa       incwyrjape                  i-picahur
        1-TEMPRY         3+fear reason                          1-run
           feared it, therefore I ran.'",[38]
"20 Adverb phrase structure
  There are no phrasal constructions with adverb heads.
                                    21 PARTICLES
  There are no particles other than conjunctions (sect. 8) interrogative markers
and response words (sect. 10), and negation words (sect. 12).
                                   22 PHONOLOGY
  The phonemes of Canela are described and given in the standard phonetic
representations of Pike (1947). The practical orthographic symbols used in this
paper are given in parentheses following the phonetic symbol. For a fuller
description, see Popjes and Popjes (1971).",[61]
"  Capi as the subject is referred to by cu in the second clause and zero in the
displaced adjunct at the end of the sentence. Jaco as object is referred to by
zero in the second clause and ih in the third.
14 Subordinate clauses
   Subordinate clauses are marked by postpositions and one free form word,
and by a subordinate clause intonation pattern (sect. 22).
  The postpositions na and to are commonly used as general subordinators; te
'because' occurs mainly with the verb pram 'want'.
(232)   wa i-xä      na       apu      i-jujaher                         to      mo

  A verb may be replaced by a dummy (pro-verb) or be deleted altogether,
under conditions described in sect. 3.
  Location pronouns commonly occur with the postposition ri or mä indicating
place. The free form he which frequently follows location pronouns indicates
that the location is in sight of both the speaker and the hearer, and the speaker
may even be pointing to it.        curi - 'there, at previously stated location'
        hyrma - 'there, to a previously identified person'
        atari - 'there, further away'
        itari - 'here, closer by'
        ihmutri - Over there'
        ihmutxa he - Over there, look'  All of the above means are used to express anaphora with the antecedent
preceding. They may be used in any syntactically appropriate situation.

        'Because Capi wanted the chief to make trouble for
        him (Jaco) he spied on Jaco and told the chief.'","[36, 37]"
"(4) Present tense is not morphologically marked.
18.2 Aspect.    Aspect in a clause is expressed by certain verb forms and/or
particles or postpositions. The aspectual distinctions in the language are as
follows:(1) Continuous action:        - apu 'continuing', a particle.
(338)   apu    i-cakoc
        CONT 1-speak
        Ί am speaking.'         - to mo 'to go along doing for the duration of a process'. The
subordinative postposition to is preceded by an active verb and followed by the

1.9 Existential.    The existential clause consists of a complement and a
subject, occurring in that order. The complement may be a person prefix, a
noun phrase or a locative phrase, followed by one of the relators ma, ri or
kam. The relator ma is used for persons, and ri and kam indicate location. The
subject is a noun phrase.

                                23 MORPHOLOGY
   This section discusses some general morphological characteristics of verbs
(see sect. 18 for treatment of particular verb and verb phrase categories).
   Nearly all verb stems have two morphemic shapes, a long form and a short
form. A few verbs have only a single form, e.g. hitep 'cut', cucäc 'singe'.
For those with two forms, the long occurs whenever the tense is (recent) past,
and elsewhere whenever the verb stem is non-final in the verb phrase. (There
is a small sub-class of intransitive verbs which have the long form in the past
tense only when the stem is non-final, see sect. 1.4). The short form of the
verb occurs elsewhere. Examples:        long form       short form        ihcuran        ihcura                        '(someone) kills it'
        ton            to                            '(someone) makes it'
        ihcahhyr       ihcahhy                       '(someone) whips it'
        cator          cato                          'he arrives'Examples of the long form are:
(391)   ca   a-te     ton
        2    2-PAST make/do
        'You made/did it.'
(392)   a-mä          ton    pram
        2-TEMPRY      make want
        'You want to make it.'
(393)   que   ha     ton   pyrentu
        3     PUT make immediately
        'He will make it immediately.'","[64, 65]"
"
For use of another form of negative response to imperative, wyr, see sect. 12.
  Hortatives differ from the imperatives by the presence of the obligatory first
person inclusive cu (dual), or cu me (plural). There is a special form of
persuasive or cajoling hortative, marked by ne (200):(198)   cu        pa-htyj
        1INCL 1- strong
        'Let's be strong.'(199)   ha      cu          me po             cura
        ATTN 1INCL PL deer                    kill
        'Hey, let's kill a deer.'(200)   ha      cu        ne
        ATTN 1INCL         PERSUASIVE
        'Hey, let's go, okay?'",[32]
"1.12 Peripheral clause level constituents.       There are eight peripheral clause
level constituents. All but two, aspect and manner, are marked by
postpositions. Time commonly occurs clause initial. The other seven elements,
location, benefactive, instrument, directional, comparison, manner and aspect,
commonly occur between the subject and the object in transitive clauses,
between the subject and the verb in other verbal clauses, and before the first
nuclear element in non-verbal clauses. These peripheral elements may occur,
subject to certain semantic constraints, in all clause types.
   Directional words and phrases are usually found in intransitive clauses with
intransitive verbs of movement. They usually precede the verb.",[9]
The following examples show the object as a noun phrase.,[2]
"  The coordinate noun phrase can occur not only as a subject as in the
examples above but also as a direct object and as a benefactive adjunct.
(115)   jaco te         rop me ropo curan to            i-pipen
        Jaco PAST dog and cat            kill    SUBORD 3-equal
        'Jaco killed equal numbers of dogs and cats.'
(116)   jaco   te        rop me          ropo       curan       xä     ita to

        Jaco PAST 1EXCL and Capi to pay                                       SUBORD 3-equal
        'Jaco paid me and Capi the same (equally).'",[18]
"Strings of two or three phrases or nouns can be negated.
(214)   i-te       catöc       me cuhe           me ko              me wapo             nare

        OBL.OM deer kill
           didn't kill the deer with a gun, bow, club or
        knife (but I killed it).'",[34]
" The subject in identificational clauses is marked with the postposition pe,
which seems to function as a copula.",[40]
"  The emphatic forms of the subject pronoun cooccur with the unmarked
forms. The emphasis is commonly contrastive.
(314)   wa ha       po    cura
        1 PUT deer kill
        Ί will kill a deer.'
(315)   pa, wa ha        po    cura

        7 will kill a deer (emphatic).'
(316)   wa ha       pa po     cura
        1 PUT 1 deer kill
        7 will kill a deer (emphatic).'",[49]
"   Direct quote complements are marked by the word hajyr/hane 'thus', which
occurs following the quote, from which it is marked off intonationally. The
quote is preceded by the introductory quotation formula, which is a complete
transitive clause in itself.
(242)   cu-te        i-mä      harkwa        ton, i-mä                        a-kin,
        3- PAST      1-to      word          make 1-TEMPRY                    2-like
        hane
        thus
        'He said to me, ""I like you."" 'The verb of the quotation formula can be omitted.",[39]
"  Discontinuous sequences are common, especially sequences involving locative
or time phrases. The function of juxtaposed phrases is commonly one of
modification, that is, each phrase narrows the spectrum of meaning of the
previous phrase.
(71)    ken    kam hikwa, ken        kre     kam
        hill   in    live      hill   hole in
        '(He) lived in a cave in the hills.'
(72)    caxwa ri hyrmä       me mo, awcahti           xä     wyr
        night  at to him PL go midnight               NOMLZR toward
        ""They went to him at night, before midnight.'",[11]
"  There is also a set of free form pronouns which may occur as subject:         wa      Ί exclusive, unmarked'
        pa       Ί exclusive, emphatic'
        cu       Ί inclusive'
         ca      '2'
        que      '3'
        ta       '3 emphatic'
        je       '2 or 3, relative'(310)   ha cu           je           ne     po     no cura
        hey 1INCL relative           and deer a kill
        'Hey, relative, let's go and kill a deer.'",[48]
"  Adjectival verb roots occur in adjectival clauses and some transitive clauses,
and also as modifiers in noun phrases and verb phrases (sects. 15.3 and 18.6):
(415)    rop ita      ih-ken
         dog DEM 3- bad
         'This dog is bad.'
(416)    i- te      rop ita      ken
         1-PAST dog DEM bad
            did bad to the dog (hurt it).'",[70]

"   Number is sometimes expressed by the particle me (meh, mem, men)
'plural', usually where the referent is human and, more specifically, Indian
(see sect. 16.1). The particle precedes the subject prefix in intransitive clauses
and the object prefix or free object in transitive clauses. The context alone
indicates whether the subject or the object is being pluralized.",[58]
"  This is the basic pattern, although there are certain additional constraints
having to do with the combination of tenses and the presence or absence of
time phrases second clause initial.
  The conjunction ne is also used to join two clauses when they have different
tenses, though in chronological order ((131) and (133)), and when a time word
occurs second clause initial (135). If the person of the subject in the second
clause is either first or second person and the tense is non-future (first clause
is past and second is present) the conjunction ne freely fluctuates with
juxtaposition ((131)-(132) and (133)-(134)).
(131)   capi te         po     curan ne      wa apu     cuku
        Capi PAST deer kill            and 1       CONT 3+eat
        'Capi killed the deer, and I'm eating it.'",[20]
"1.11 Basic word order.       The basic word order for both main and
subordinate clauses may be summarized as follows:       - transitive and stative transitive: subject-object-verb
       - pseudo-transitive: subject-oblique object-verb
       - intransitive, stative and adjectival: subject-verb
       - equational and identificational: subject-complement
       - existential: complement-subject   For the purpose of focus or emphasis the object in transitive clauses may be
fronted, and phonologically dislocated by pause, and the verb prefix then
occurs. Since there are several other ways to mark emphasis (see sect. 16) this
fronting of the object is rare, being found most often in the context of
correcting a misunderstanding in the minds of the hearers.
(61)       i-te        po     curan
           1-PAST deer kill
              killed a deer.'

           deer,    1 1-PAST         3- kill
           'It was a deer I killed.'",[9]
"  The four non-verbal clause types are distinguished by the presence or
absence of a subject and, when it occurs, the means by which it is related to
the predicate complement.",[6]
"  The negator nare functions as a conjunction carrying the meaning Or if not,
then'. In this usage, nare occurs between the two clauses, and the intonation
pattern usually associated with negation does not occur (see sect. 12 for normal
use of nare with special intonation and the long form of the verb):
(144)   ca ha        pur        wyr te,          nare ca ha                kri
