"Grammatical alignment is strictly nominative-accusative, both morphologically andsyntactically. Subjects in Hup are unmarked, while nouns occurring in a variety of non-subject roles are object-marked with the suffix -a‡n, provided they conform to certainsemantic restrictions relating to the noun’s placement on the animacy/ definitenesshierarchy. Oblique arguments (which are not subject to any animacy restrictions) aremarked with the suffix -Vêt in instrumental, comitative, and locative roles, and with whatis apparently an unstressed variant of the Object marker -an (glossed ‘Directional’) inlocative and allative/ablative roles. A noun can take no more than a single case marker ata time. These patterns are summarized in Table 4.3.",[241]

4.3.1. Object case -a‡nThe patterning of core case marking—depending both on the semantic role of thenominal and on its semantic status (with respect to animacy and definiteness)—isdiscussed in this section. When marking core arguments, the stress on the object marker-an‡ is quite strong: it is often equal to that on the noun stem itself, and in certain cases itmay be noticeably stronger (especially with pronouns and demonstratives) and couldarguably be considered to be primary stress.","[241, 242]"
"       Hup has nominative-accusative alignment and employs morphological casemarking. In general, it favors dependent marking (realized mainly as nominal casemarking and possession marked on the possessor). Hup grammar shows sensitivity to ananimacy hierarchy and particularly to humanness; this is particularly evident in itssystems of differential object case marking and differential or ‘split’ plural/collectivemarking, which reflect the animacy of the referent. Such differential grammaticalmarking is a feature of the languages of the Vaupés region generally.
                                                                                            3
       Other features of Hup grammar include a basically verb-final constituent order;this is best characterized as AOV, although the relative order of A and O is highlyflexible. In addition, Hup has developed a complex evidentiality system (with fivedistinctions) and an incipient system of noun classification; these features also fit theregional profile, and their development in Hup has probably been motivated by contactwith Tukano. Finally, an intriguing aspect of Hup grammar is the significant and evenexuberant polyfunctionality of many morphemes, which in most cases reflects traceablehistorical processes of grammaticalization.","[19, 20]"
"5.1.4. Nominal compounds involving adjectives: attributive uses of aspectCertain complex nominal expressions in Hup are formed from the combination of a nounand an adjective. This role of adjectives is distinct from their typical use as productivemodifiers in noun phrases (see §6.6), in that they do not simply modify a nominal headwithin the noun phrase, but themselves are an intrinsic component of a complex nominalhead, that in most cases can itself be modified. The adjectives in this distinct role aremorphologically marked, setting them apart from the more conventional modifiers. It is apeculiar feature of Hup grammar that there is a formal overlap between themorphological means for marking these compound-internal attributives, and the markingof aspect (primarily on verbs) elsewhere in the language.",[304]
"E. InanimatesFor inanimate entities unmarked for number, Object case marking is ungrammatical (andnote that number is usually unmarked on inanimates even if conceptually plural; see§4.4.1).

        (P.F.125)
F. Plural nounsObject marking is always required when the Plural/collective marker =d’´h is present,regardless of the animacy or definiteness of the noun. Typologically, this appears at firstglance to be a peculiar twist on differential object marking. However, it in fact makessense in light of the fact that number marking in Hup involves essentially the samesemantic parameters as does differential object marking, conforming to ananimacy/definiteness hierarchy (see §4.4.1 below). Moreover, Hup is not alone amonglanguages in displaying an interaction of plural with case marking. For example, animatenouns in Russian have a different way of forming the accusative case in the plural, as domale human nouns in Polish (cf. Comrie 1981: 132)—which may reflect an interactionbetween differential object marking and an animacy-based plurality ‘split’ like that foundin Hup.","[253, 254]"
"       An example of a plural-marked animal object with obligatory case marking isgiven in (49). While inanimate nouns are almost never marked for plural in ordinarydiscourse, they may be—and are then Object-marked—as in example (50).

       ‘I blew the papers down.’ (EL)
4.3.1.3. Object marking on NPs and relative clausesCase marking in Hup is not limited to the individual nominal word, but also occurs onnoun phrases and relative clauses. In these cases, it marks the phrase as a whole, ratherthan attaching to phrase-internal nominal heads or other constituents, and occurs phrase-finally—even following nominal enclitics.59 In this section, I provide a short discussionof the patterning of object marking with demonstrative and adjective NPs (which arediscussed in more detail in §6.3 and §6.6.), and with headless relative clauses (see§18.2.3)
                                                                                                       239
A. Demonstrative + Noun NPsJust as object marking is required on all demonstratives acting as nominal heads, NPscontaining a demonstrative also receive obligatory object marking, regardless of theiranimacy or number. The case marker usually attaches to the final constituent of the NP,as in examples (51-54).

        ‘As for the dog, (he’s) standing up (against the tree), looking at this wasp nest.’
        (FS.5)The NP-final marking of case applies even when both members of the NP areindividually marked as plural:
(55)    “c´¤/      nˆN   cQg-/áy hám!” nç-d’´h-d’ób-óh,                   yˆ-d’´‡h /ãêy=n’a‡n-áh

        ‘“You all go net shrimp!” (he) said, sending those women to the river.’ (LG-C.18)
59
  This ability of Hup case markers to attach to whatever constituent is phrase-final gives them a
resemblance to enclitics themselves, although they bear the (somewhat language-specific) label ‘suffixes’,
in keeping with their other properties (see §3.4).
                                                                                                       240
        However, if a demonstrative and non-human noun themselves form distinct,co-referential NPs in an appositional relationship, the demonstrative alone may take thecase marker, with the non-human noun remaining unmarked.60

                 ‘We’ll eat this fish.’ (EL)Unlike demonstratives, numerals in NPs without overt plural-marking do not require thepresence of the Object marker:(57)    bodáca /óytu=b’ah, yˆ¤t             pˆ¤d   j’ãêh       /ˆ¤n-a‡n   t ˆh   nç¤/-ç¤y

        ‘Eight cookies, that’s what she gave to each of us.’ (P.txt.3)
B. Adjective NPsObject marking on (N + Adj) NPs follows the general animacy/definiteness-related rules,as illustrated by (58-59). When it occurs, -a‡n typically attaches to the adjective, as lastmember of the NP (example 59).61 Case marking can optionally occur on both membersof the NP only when the adjective modifier is nominalized by the bound preform tˆh=(example 59).
(58)    j’ám        nˆ‡        b’éj         tˆh=po‡g hˆd d’o/-way-yˆ/-ní-h!

        ‘Yesterday they took my big jandiá fish!’ (B.Cv.94)60
   When asked, one consultant thought that (b) might be somewhat more restrictive, but no consistent
answer to this question has yet been established.
61
   Note that the pattern of NP-final case marking also applies to noun compounds.

       ‘She likes the big man, it’s said.’ (EL)       In general, adjectives standing alone as nominal heads require the default 3sgpronominal form tˆh= (just like bound nouns in Hup), and are obligatorily object-marked,regardless of number marking or animacy, as in (60-61). The same is true for numeralsappearing alone as heads.

       ‘He only wants the good ones.’ (H.txt.55)
C. Headless relative clausesHeadless relative clauses standing in for object nominals are subject to essentially thesame rules for object marking as are nouns, with one exception. As discussed in §18.2.3,relative clauses in object position may occur either with or without a head noun. Whileobject marking follows the normal rules relating to animacy and definiteness when thisnoun is present, it is obligatory when the noun is absent. In this case, the Object markeris always separated from the verb by the ‘Filler’ form -Vw- (see §15.2.4 and §18.2.3); anexample in given in (62).

Directional oblique case -anThe form -an is phonologically almost identical to the Object case marker -a‡n, differingfrom its sister suffix only in its lack of stress. The two are probably closely relatedhistorically, but synchronically they are distinct, not only in their form but also in theirfunctions and semantic patterning. The preferred use of Directional -an is to expressallative/ablative case, relating to directional goals and sources; but it can also function toexpress location in general, where it seems largely interchangeable with Oblique -Vêt (see§4.3.4).","[255, 256, 257, 258, 259]"
"       The forms in question include the ‘Associative plural’ -an-d’´h (an + PL/COLL;see §4.4.6 below), as in example (73); the ‘indefinite associative’ construction -an-/u‡y(an + ‘who’; see §7.5), as in (74); and the ‘temporal adverbial’ construction -an-ay (an +INCH; see §18.2.6.2), as in (75).(73)   yu‚Ù-an-n’a‡n       hˆd /éy-éy

4.3.4. Oblique case -VêtA variety of non-core participants in the clause are marked with the catch-all oblique caseform -Vêt. The Oblique marker is always required where applicable; unlike the Objectmarker, its presence is not dependent on the animacy, definiteness, or numberspecification of the noun. Nonetheless, the interpretation of the semantic role of theoblique-marked referent is necessarily somewhat dependent on the parameter of animacy.
                                                                                                246
The semantic roles indicated by this form include locative (inanimates), instrumental(inanimates), and comitative (animates);62 such an overlap of semantic roles andgrammatical relations is not particularly uncommon (cf. Blake 2001: 63).","[262, 263]"
"       While adjectives in Hup are best understood as comprising a closed class, thereare a few cases in which uninflected verb stems follow nouns as modifiers. Although thisis in general a diagnostic of adjectives as opposed to verbs or nouns, these uninflectedverbal variants are not productive, but are frozen into specific lexicalized forms such askQn pú ‘shibé’ (a drink of farinha and water). They are therefore not considered to bepart of the adjective class. Another unusual case is dç/key ‘correct’, a lexicalizedadjectival form derived from the verb compound dç/-key- (‘count-see’); this form is aderived adjective, but its etymological components are clearly members of the verb class.
                                                                                                       54810.2. Adverbs and adverbialsAdverbial expressions in Hup function as modifiers of the verb phrase, or in a few cases,of other adjectives (note that adjectives are more often modified by bound emphasis andintensifier morphemes; see §15.1-2). There is no distinct word class of adverbs; manyadverbial expressions are simply adjectives used in an adverbial role, but nouns, verbs,and entire clauses can also function as modifiers of a verb phrase, as can ideophones(§15.7). This section focuses on simple adverbial expressions in Hup, including theclause-initial adverbial element hi‚ê, as well as Hup’s strategies for expressingcomparison—which generally rely on adverbials to indicate the standard of comparison.","[564, 565]"
"3.1.4. Other word classesHup has several additional word classes, which play a relatively minor role in thegrammar compared to the major classes of nouns, verbs, and adjectives. Small closedclasses of words that can occur as heads or modifiers in noun phrases are pronouns,demonstratives, interrogative pronouns, and numerals (which can all be consideredsubsets of the noun class more generally; see chapter 6). Locative and temporalpostpositions also form a closed class (itself made up of two sub-classes), whoseelements occur either within noun phrases or independently as adverbs (§10.2.3).",[176]
"       In Hup, nouns with inanimate referents are generally unmarked for number,although—unlike the restrictions governing differential object marking—numbermarking on inanimates is possible. When counting inanimates, the numeral alone usuallysuffices to indicate plurality (e.g. ka/ap mç‡y [two house] ‘two houses’); classifiers arealso used in certain cases (see §4.4.3). Nouns referring to animals are found both with
                                                                                        254
and without number marking, whereas it is required for humans. While languageswith split plurality systems have many options in arranging their systems of differentialnumber marking, languages like Comanche and Kannada (Corbett 2000: 70) exhibitpatterns very much like that found in Hup.","[270, 271]"
"          Hup’s default nominalizer in a relative clause is the Dependent marker -Vp, aBoundary Suffix that attaches directly to the verb. Normally, a relativized verb markedwith -Vp is directly followed by a head nominal; this may be a full noun (example 61-63),or a bound noun (example 63). This relative clause + head noun construction issyntactically akin to the compound noun (see Chapter 5), in that the relative clauseresembles the first nominal constituent—the modifier—of the noun phrase. Use of abound noun as the head nominal is generally preferred when one is available. Note thatthe Dependent marker -Vp has other functions in Hup besides its role in relative clauses;these are discussed in §18.2.4 below (see also §7.1.5).
                                                                                                  997

       (E.SB.4)       Headless relative clauses marked only with the default nominalizer -Vp are quiterare in Hup, but they do exist. In such cases, the headless relative must act as the subjectof the main clause (example 64), or as a predicate nominal (example 65); headlessrelatives acting as objects or obliques within the main clause are nominalized via adifferent strategy (see below).

       ‘(This is one that was) given to me by Mih.’ (showing off a fishhook) (OS)It is not entirely clear why such Vp-marked clauses occur so rarely as headless relatives;however, this is probably due to the fact that the Dependent marker can also function as amarker of a default adverbial clause (and does so quite often, as discussed in detail in§18.2.4.1 below), as illustrated in example (66). This dual function of dependent clauses
                                                                                         998
marked by -Vp is reminiscent of the synchronically dual function of the ‘adjoinedrelative clause’ found in many Australian languages (Hale 1976), which can beinterpreted as either a relative or an adverbial clause.

       ‘She was going along netting shrimp, it’s said.’ (I.M)       A second nominalization strategy for relative clauses involves the Plural marker=d’´h. As is consistent with Hup’s system of ‘split plurality’ (cf. §4.4.1), only relativeclauses referring to animate entities may be overtly marked as plural with =d’´h. Inthese cases, =d’´h essentially fills the role of head nominal, on a par with a bound noun(i.e. forming a relative clause that is intermediate between headed and headless).","[1013, 1014, 1015]"

17.3. Declarative clausesThis section treats the declarative clause in Hup. Declarative clauses are defined both byconstituent order and morphological marking, and include both affirmative and negativestatements, as well as non-verbal clauses involving predicate nominals, adjectives, andlocatives.
                                                                                          905
17.3.1. Constituent order in the declarative clauseConstituent order in Hup is relatively free, but the formally least-marked pattern is clearlyverb-final. Defining the order of nominal arguments in the transitive clause is moredifficult, but the ‘basic’ constituent order can arguably be identified as AOV. The actualorder of all constituents appears to be determined primarily by pragmatics, with the mostimportant parameter being the fronting of new information. Other relevant factors thatcorrelate with word order are verbal tense and aspect, and the identity of nominalconstituents as pronouns or full lexical nouns. Both context and the existence ofmorphological core case-marking (see §4.3.1), which corresponds to a consistentlynominative-accusative alignment system, help to disambiguate syntactic arguments.","[921, 922]"
"       In this chapter, I present the simple noun stem and the categories of nominalmorphology that are most basic to it, case and number. I also offer a brief discussion ofthe lexical phenomenon of reduplication in nouns, and summarize the processes ofnominal derivation. Processes of nominal compounding are treated in chapter 5, andmulti-word noun phrases are covered in chapter 6.",[231]
"Nevertheless, a given nominal root can often take multiple formatives, including suffixesas well as enclitics. In keeping with Hup morphological patterns in general, these alwaysfollow the stem—with the marginal exception of the procliticization of the third personsingular pronoun tˆh to some bound nouns (see §5.4). In general, formatives attach to the

last element of the noun phrase in Hup, rather than to the head noun within the NP,regardless of how phonologically integrated the bound morpheme is with its host stem.55         A morphological slot sequence for the noun is given here:
     STEM—Number[-d’´h]—(Filler[-Vw])—Case[-a‡n, -an, -Vêt]/Dependent marker[-Vp]
                       —Aspect/Focus—Declarative[-Vêh]         The discussion of nominal morphology in this chapter concentrates on theinflectional marking of case and number; these forms are considered to bemorphosyntactically maximally ‘basic’ to the noun, since they relate intrinsically to theidentity of the individual nominal referent and to its syntactic role in the clause.","[239, 240]"

Acknowledgements
This project would never have been possible without the help and support of so many
people along the way. First of all, I am very grateful to the Hupd’´h, who welcomed me
into their villages. I particularly want to thank my primary consultants, Pedro Pires Dias
(Ya/am D’úb), Teresa Monteiro Socot (Mu‡n), and Jovino Monteiro (Hu‡d), as well as
Americo Monteiro (M’Qh J’ˆ‡h), Sabino Monteiro (/Q‡d), and Jarbas Dias (J’ib Hˆ‡/).
Thanks also to all the other people who told stories or sang songs for the tape recorder, or
simply put up with its presence in the midst of their conversations. I also especially want
to thank my adopted ‘family’ in Barreira, Mario, Selina, José Luis, Ped, Aracy, Emilia,
José Maria, and Luisa, for their warm friendship and many meals together; likewise
Paulina, Jovita, and others in Tat Deh, and the many children, young people, and others
who were my companions for over a year.
        Also in Brazil, I owe enormous thanks to Dr. Denny Moore, who first suggested I
work with the Hupd’´h, and who did considerable legwork to help make that possible. I
am also very grateful to Dr. Nilson Gabas Jr., who has acted as my sponsor in Brazil, and
to Jorge Pozzobon and others at the Museu Paraense Emilio Goeldi in Belém.
        I am very grateful to the Instituto Socioambiental, particularly to Beto Ricardo,
Marta Azevedo, and others of the Rio Negro team—Carlão, Fernando, Francimar, and
Flora and Aloisio Cabalzar. ISA helped me with the practical issues of fieldwork in a
thousand ways, such as transportation to and from the Indigenous Area, a place to stay in
São Gabriel, advice, and friendship. Without their help, fieldwork would have been next
to impossible.
        I would also like to thank FOIRN (Federação das Organizações Indígenas do Rio
Negro) for their support and interest in the project, and CNPq (Conselho Nacional de
Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnológico) and FUNAI (Fundação Nacional do Indio)
for their permission to undertake research in Brazil and within the Indigenous Area. I am
grateful to the health agents (of Saude Sem Limites, etc.) working in the region for their
support, and particularly to Marc de Bont and Herma Klandermans for their friendship
and help during my months in the field. Thanks also to Renato Athias and Henri Ramirez
for interesting discussions regarding the Hupd’´h and their language.
        I am very grateful to the organizations that funded this research: Fulbright-Hays,
the National Science Foundation (Grant 0111550), and the Max Planck Institute for
Evolutionary Anthropology.
        I did the bulk of the writing of this grammar at the Max Planck Institute in
Leipzig, Germany, and I owe the department there a great deal of thanks for their support
and for the strong intellectual climate that helped to foster this project. I would like to
thank Helma van den Berg, Juliette Blevins, Lea Brown, Claudia Büchel, Julia
Cissewski, Bernard Comrie, Michael Cysouw, Jeff Good, Tom Güldemann, Elena
Lieven, Martin Haspelmath, Susanne Michaelis, Don Stilo, and many others for their
insights and comments on various aspects of this work, as well as for their friendship in
Leipzig. I am also grateful to Nick Enfield and others at the MPI for Psycholinguistics in
Nijmegen, who generously supplied me with the extremely useful (and fun) elicitation
materials that they have developed for use in the field, and with whom I had many
                                                                                        xiv
stimulating discussions. In addition, I would like to thank a number of other linguists
for their input on aspects of Hup grammar or its typological implications, particularly
Alexandra Aikhenvald, Mark Donahue, Nick Evans, Larry Hyman, Claire LeFebvre, and
others.
        In particular, I would like to thank Orin Gensler, who read and made copious
insightful comments on every page of this manuscript. I can never thank him enough for
the amount of time and care he put into being my mentor at MPI, or for his unfailing
encouragement and support during the writing process. With his vast knowledge of
typology and historical linguistics, his meticulous approach, and his enormous patience,
Orin would be anyone’s ideal mentor.
         At the University of Virginia, I owe enormous thanks to my advisor Eve
Danziger, who has been behind this project from the very beginning, and who has been
an invaluable part of every step in the process. Without her insightful comments, her
encouragement, and her constant support, it is hard to imagine how this project would
have been possible.
        I am also grateful to the other members of my committee, Lise Dobrin, Ellen
Contini-Morava, George Mentore, and Peter Hook, for all their helpful comments at
various stages of the project. Thanks as well to the others in the Department of
Anthropology at UVA, especially for their willingness to let me take this project where I
wanted it to go.
        Finally, a special thanks to my husband Chris for all his support and his patience
with my long absences.

1. Hup and its speakers        The approximately 1500 speakers1 of the Hup language (also known as Hupda)live scattered throughout the heavily forested region on the Brazil-Colombia frontier. Onthe Brazilian side, the region is known as the Cabeça de Cachorro or ‘Dog’s Head’ (dueto its shape on the map), and is part of the state of Amazonas. Within this region, mostHup speakers live in an area of approximately 5400 square kilometers, defined by theTiquié River to the south, the Vaupés River to the east, and the Papuri River to the north,as shown in Map 1.1.","[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18]"

7.1. ‘Promiscuous’ verbal morphology and the noun class103In general, Hup bound morphology tends to be highly promiscuous, as discussed in §3.3(see also Appendix I). Even the forms that are most closely integrated phonologicallywith their hosts (i.e. the vowel-copying formatives defined as Boundary Suffixes inrelation to verbs) are usually able to attach to various parts of speech, often occurring in a
                                                                                           422
range of distinct constructions, and serving a variety of functions. Accordingly, verylittle nominal morphology in Hup is strictly nominal. As discussed in Chapter 4, even themarkers of case and number—the main inflectional forms that can be consideredprimarily nominal—are not strictly limited to nominal hosts; the case suffixes are capableof combining with verb stems to form adverbial clauses, and the case and numbermarkers attach to verb stems in relative clause contexts (producing nominalizations).","[437, 438, 439]"

A. Relativized noun is the subject of the relative clauseThe examples in this section illustrate the relativized noun’s role as the subject of therelative clause. In (73-75), the relative clause is also the subject of the main clause. Notethat these examples are headed; headless relative clauses in main-clause subject position(i.e. nominalized by -Vp only) are rare, as discussed above.
(73)     /am=tóg         tQ‚êh     hu‚h-j’çm-tú/-úh,
         2sg=daughter offspring hold-bathe-go.into.liquid-DECL

been replaced elsewhere by -Vêt.

Note that the Diminutive Intensifier enclitic =mQh can come between the relativeclause and Plural =d’´h, which acts as the head nominal:
(75)   tˆh=dó/=mQh=d’´h,             [/íp     pãÙ]=mQh=d’´h, hˆd       /ç‚h-yˆ¤/-ˆ¤h

       ‘The little children, the little fatherless ones, they fell asleep.’ (I.M.45)In examples (76-78), the relativized noun is the subject of the relative clause and theobject of the main clause. Headless variants (in which the verb is nominalized by [Filler+ case marker]) such as (76) and (78) are common in this main-clause position.

       path       work=PL.OBJ 3sg     pay-give-FLR-INCH
       ‘He began to pay those who worked on the road.’ (H.txt.64)Note that when a headless relative clause has its own internal animate object, this canresult in embedding of object-marked nominal forms within the larger utterance:
(78)   [[tˆh=tQ‚êh=d’´h-a‡n]     cˆw-/é-w-a‡n]          mQh-mQy-yó/=mah...
         3sg=offspring=PL-OBJ cook-PERF-FLR-OBJ kill-payment-SEQ=REP
       ‘Having killed in revenge the one who had cooked his children…’ (P.BY.92)Also note that the headless (obligatorily object-marked) relative clause and the noun towhich it refers may both appear in the main clause as independent, appositional NPs, asin (79). This is clearly not a headed relative clause, which would appear in the form[pQm-ní-ip hçhç¤h], with the head nominal following the Dependent-marked verb phrase.
                                                                                              1004

       toad        sit-be-FLR-OBJ     beat-take-SEQ=REP
       ‘Having whacked the toad that was sitting there…’ (P.BT.93)In example (80), the relativized nouns are the subjects of the relative clauses and thedirect object and recipient, respectively, of a ditransitive main clause:
(80)   g’áj       ya/ám wç¤y-ç¤h,                [g’áj    wç¤n]-çw-a‡n-áh,

                 (H-CO.79)Finally, the relativized nouns in (81-82) are the subjects of the relative clauses andpredicate nominals in the main clauses:
(81)   /ãh [bˆ/-hipãêh-ãp]=/‚ih
       1sg       work-know-DEP=MSC
       ‘I’m one who knows how to do (this).’ (OS)(82)   [/ˆnˆ‡h      /ˆ‡d   /ˆ¤d-ˆp]=/ãêy    tˆ¤h=ti/,        nç-yó/...

       ‘Having thought, “this is one who speaks our language!”…’ (T.PN.27)
B. Relativized noun is the object of the relative clauseIn (83-86), the relativized noun is the object of the relative clause and the subject of themain clause. As expected (vis-à-vis the discussion above), case marking on the relativeclause (whether headed or headless) corresponds to its role within the main clause, not itsrole within the relative clause.
                                                                                                 1005

       ‘The woman [from whom we stole clothes] has died, it’s said.’ (EL)In (87), the relativized noun is not only the object of the relative clause, but also theobject of the main clause; it appears as headless and Object-marked:
(87)   t ˆh    yçhç¤y-çp      hˆdnˆ‡h     hçhç¤h, [hˆd key-/é]-w-a‡n
       3sg     search-DEP     3pl.POSS     toad      3pl    see-PERF-FLR-OBJ
       ‘He’s looking for their toad, the one they had been looking at.’ (FS.3)Note, however, that while case marking is obligatory when the headless relative is themain-clause object (as in 88), case marking is not required (although it is preferred) whenthe relative clause in this position is headed (and the referent is non-human; recall thatObject-marking is elsewhere required only on human objects, see §4.3.1.2):
(88)   [/ãêh du-/e‡-p]              hçhte‡g(-a‡n)   t ˆh   b’uy-d’´h-yˆ¤/-ˆ¤y

In example (89), the relativized noun is the object of the relative clause and theoblique in the main clause; the head nominal is case-marked accordingly:
(89)   wç‡n’    wót-óy=cud        [j’u‡g-an   yu)Ù d’o-ye-/e‡-p]       tegd’uh tQê‚h-Q‚êt

       ‘She’s stirring mingau with the stick that John brought from the forest.’ (EL)
C. Relativized noun is oblique in relative clauseExamples of a relativized noun that is an oblique in the relative clause are given in (90),in which it is also the subject of the main clause, and in examples (91-92), in which it isthe object of the main clause. Again, case-marking on the relative clause corresponds toits main-clause role.

       ‘The child hit the one with which he was playing, the cat.’ (EL)In (93), the relativized noun is both an oblique in the relative clause and an oblique in themain clause:
(93)   [teg‡   /am hu‚h-/ay-/e‡-p]             b’ç‡t-ç¤t

(94)   [/ˆn wQ¤d-Qp]=teg yúw-úh
        1pl   eat-DEP=tree     that.ITG-DECL
       ‘That’s the tree that we eat from!’ (OS)
18.2.3.1. Other constructions with a relationship to relative clausesThe [relative clause + head nominal] construction in Hup corresponds to the [N1(modifier) + N2 (head)] structure of a nominal compound. In keeping with this fact,headed relative clauses resemble a sub-type of nominal compound in Hup, in which abare verb stem (i.e. lacking a Dependent marker) acts as N1 and combines with a noun—often a bound noun—as N2; e.g. wç‡ç hod (boil hole) ‘Boiling Hole’ (cf. §5.1).","[1019, 1020, 1021, 1022, 1023, 1024]"
"       In addition to these factors, incorporating forms differ syntactically fromintransitive clauses with ni-. For example, the incorporated verbs take a nominativepronoun, whereas non-incorporated nominal constructions can only take a possessive
                                                                                         538
pronoun. This is illustrated in example (127) for cç‚h-ni- ‘dream’ and (128) for wanni- ‘knife exists’:
(127) a)        /ãh cç‚h-ní-íy
                1sg     dream-be-DYNM
                ‘I dreamed.’ (OS)        b)      *nˆ‡           cç‚Ùh           ní-íy

                  1sg        knife      be-DYNM        b)      nˆ‡            wa‡n       ní-íy
                1sg.POSS        knife     be-DYNM
                ‘My knife exists/ is here.’ (i.e. ‘I have a knife.’) (EL)
However, some nouns can occur both in intransitive clauses with ni- and in incorporatedconstructions, as illustrated in example (129-30).
(129) /ãh      hçm-ní-íy
        1sg   sore-be-DYNM
        ‘I have a sore/sores.’ (EL)(130) nˆ‡             hç¤m    ní-íy
        1sg.POSS sore         be-DYNM
        ‘My sore exists.’ (i.e. ‘I have a sore.’) (EL)
        Another syntactic indication of incorporation is the fact that non-incorporated ni-clauses are intransitive, whereas many incorporated constructions can take a direct objectwhich is distinct from the incorporated noun. That the incorporated noun is itself not adirect object is evidenced by the fact that it cannot be marked for case, despite its numberand animacy, whereas case-marking is obligatory for plural and human direct objects.
                                                                                          539
Examples (131-32) show plural, human incorporated nouns that are unmarked forcase, with and without (case-marked) direct objects in the clause; example (133) showsan incorporated form used as a nominalized, headless relative clause, in which the object-marking occurs on the entire nominalized verb form but not on the incorporated noun.

       ‘I take care of those with sores.’ (EL)In contrast, examples (134-35) show non-incorporated direct objects with obligatory casemarking.

       ‘I take care of my sores.’ (EL)
       More evidence that the incorporated compound forms a single lexical item comesfrom one case—that of do/-d’´h-ni- ‘have children, become a parent’—in which anincorporated noun is obligatorily marked for plural. This plural-marking is frozen intothe compound construction and does not change with the pragmatics of the situation (i.e.it appears regardless of whether the entities in question are actually single or multiple, as
                                                                                           540
in example (122) above and in (136). Note that the incorporated singular form has acompletely different meaning, do/-ni- ‘be a child’ (example 137).
(136) /ãh     do/-d’´h-ní-íy
       1sg    child-PL-be-DYNM
       ‘I have children; I am a parent.’ (even if only one child) (EL)(137) /ãh     do/-ní-íy
       1sg    child-be-DYNM
       ‘I am a child.’ (EL)
       In addition, incorporating ni- constructions act as units in derivation and otherverb-related processes. They appear in the middle of longer verb compounds, such asb’oy-cum-ni- (study-beginning-be-) ‘begin to study’ in example (120) above, and cantake verbal valency-adjusting prefixes like any other verb:(138) hi-bab’-ni
       FACT-sibling-be
       ‘four’ (lit. ‘caused to have a sibling/companion’)(139) /u‚h-bab’-ni-d’o/-yˆ¤/-ˆ¤y
       RECP-sibling-be-take-TEL-DYNM
       ‘Come to live with relatives (after having lived away)’ (EL)
       Finally, still more evidence that the [noun + ni-] forms involve incorporationcomes from negation strategies, which are different for predicate nominals and for verbalpredicates (see chapter 16). Nominals may be negated with the ‘negative existence’particle pãÙ (‘is not present, does not exist’; example 140a), while verbal negationrequires the suffix -nˆ¤h on the verb (140b). Incorporating forms typically take verbalnegation (example 141).
                                                                                          541

       sibling-be-NEG DST.CNTR       1sg=EMPH.TAG
       ‘I have no one/ no siblings to accompany me.’ (T.PN.3)       As noted above, the productivity of incorporation with ni- appears to be limited;most incorporated forms are conventionalized and many have developed idiosyncraticmeanings. However, there are one or two examples in my corpus where speakers useincorporating forms that are highly lexically specific and unusual, suggesting that theprocess may occasionally be used to produce new, non-conventionalized forms, as we seein example (142):
(142) ní-íy=mah,           pó/d’ah có/,     d’ub-ní=d’´h
       be-DYNM=REP         upriver   LOC    tail-be=PL
       ‘They exist, they say, upriver; those (people) who have tails.’ (LG.C.21)
Comparative Note       Noun incorporation with ni- in Hup may be motivated by contact with Tukano,which uses a verbalizer -ti to make a noun into a verb meaning ‘have N’ (Ramirez 1997:353). For example, the Tukano noun põ’ra ‘children’ (generic/suppletive plural) isverbalized with the -ti suffix to produce põ’ra-ti ‘have children’, just as Hup do/=d’´h‘children’ (regular generic plural) occurs in the compound do/-d’´h-ni- ‘have children’(136 above), and d’ub ‘tail’ occurs in d’ub-ni- ‘have a tail’ in (142) above.

10. Adjectives and adverbial expressions
        This chapter addresses those parts of speech that are functionally and/or formallyrelated to the verb. These are the adjectives, which form a small, closed class of theirown, and the adverbial expressions, which are not a distinct word class in Hup, but arederived from other parts of speech and function as modifiers of the verb phrase. BecauseHup’s adjectives and adverbials are best understood in their relation to the verb, and—inthe case of the adjectives—they act much like verb roots for morphosyntactic purposesand take many essentially verbal markers of aspect, mode, and valency (which arediscussed in the following chapters), they are treated at this point in the grammar.","[554, 555, 556, 557, 558, 559]"
"Note that—like the lexically singular personal pronouns—/u‡y cannot inflect for number,but does take the Associative plural form -and’´h (see §4.4.6). The form /u‡y has oneadditional use, beyond its function as an interrogative pronoun; it occurs as an enclitic inconstructions meaning ‘one from/associated with’ (see §7.5 below).

       ‘Who’s that?’ (EL)       As a nominal, the interrogative particle hˆ‚ usually appears in its derived form hˆ‚-n’ˆ‡h ‘what’ (interrogative + nominalizer suffix), which can occur as a full NP and takeoblique case marking (though not object marking; example 11), and can modify another

noun within an NP (example 12). Other forms of hˆ‚ commonly occurring in NPsinclude hˆ‚êp ‘which’ and hˆ‚-/a‡p ‘how many’, which modify nouns as interrogativedeterminers.(11)   hˆ‚-n’ˆ‡h-ˆ¤t          tˆh yçhç¤y-ç/?

       Q-NMZ           fish     that.ITG=AGAIN
       ‘What kind of fish is that?’ (OS)       Interrogative hˆ‚ also has adverbial functions relating to direction, location, andtime, as in examples (13-14).

       ‘When (did he leave it by the river)?’ (B.Cv.93)       Like demonstratives (see below), interrogative hˆ‚ is in general unable to standalone as an uninflected form. The only exception is its occurrence with two verbal forms,nç- ‘say’ and nˆh- ‘be like’ (examples 15-16), where it occurs (unmarked) in objectfunction; here it can be separated from the verb by a subject pronoun (16), an additionalverb root in a compound, or other morphology.

6.3. DemonstrativesThe Hup demonstrative system involves five basic terms, which combine with variousbound inflectional suffixes and enclitics to create a large set of derived forms(summarized in Table 4.2, §4.1.2). In addition to the interrogative particle hˆ‚, the systemencodes four other distinctions: proximal, distal, ‘intangible’ (where physicalaccessibility is lacking or irrelevant), and alterative (i.e. ‘other’).87 These basic semanticdistinctions are contrasted in example (17). Example (18) illustrates the same contrast,but with temporal rather than spatial reference.","[384, 385, 386]"
"4.3.4.1. Semantic roles and oblique markingA. ComitativeThe comitative use of the Oblique indicates that X carries out an activity together with Y,where Y is animate, as in examples (76-79). Examples (76-77), in particular, alsoillustrate the fact that the comitative semantics actually subsumes a locative associationas well.(76)       /ãêh=/íp-ít        /ãh ni-/e/-ní-h

B. InstrumentalThe instrumental use of the Oblique indicates that X performs an activity by means ofinanimate Y (an animate Y would essentially result in comitative semantics).

In this semantic role(but not in the comitative or instrumental), consultants usually judge Oblique -Vêt to begrammatically interchangeable with the (object-like) Directional marker -an, and cangive no insights into any semantic difference between the two options (this is the case, forexample, in 84-88 below).63 Nevertheless, a comparison of how the two pattern naturallyin discourse suggests that -an is preferred where the spatial range in question extendsbeyond the point of reference, while -Vêt is preferred when the event is carried outcompletely within the given location, without reference to directional movement from, to,or through it.

In cases where the interpretation of thenoun’s semantic role is potentially ambiguous between instrumental and locative, -Vêt is
                                                                                            250
preferred for the instrumental role, and Directional -an for the locative, as in example(94a) and (b). That this preference only surfaces in cases of ambiguity is illustrated bythe related but locative -Vêt-marked example in (95).

D. TemporalOblique -Vêt can also have a temporal function. This is limited to a very small set ofnouns denoting specific points in time, as in examples (96-97), and resembles its use withverbs in temporal adverbials (see §4.3.4.2 below and §18.2.6.2).(96)   cetémbudu-ut /ãh maca-ní-h

E. Inanimate actor of a reflexive (passive) constructionOne further use of the Oblique marker -Vêt is to mark the inanimate actor (i.e. that whichwould be the agent in the corresponding active clause) in a passive-type reflexive
                                                                                           251
construction (see §11.1.2). While animate actors in passive constructions take theObject marker -a‡n (§4.3.1.1.D), inanimates must take the Oblique, as in example (96).

4.4.4.2. Oblique marking and subordinate clausesLike the other case markers in Hup, Oblique -Vêt is also used to form adverbial andrelative clauses (see §18.2.3 and §18.2.6.2 for more discussion). In its adverbial function,Oblique -Vêt can have either a temporal or a spatial function. As such, it usually attachesdirectly to a verb root, as does Directional -an (§4.3.2 above); however, it canoccasionally appear as its variant -ˆt, with the intervening ‘Filler’ syllable -Vw-. It signalseither a temporal overlap (examples 99-100) or a location (example 101).

4.4. NumberHup marks non-singular number on nouns and noun phrases with the form =d’´h.","[263, 264, 265, 266, 267, 268, 269]"
"       In the case of the noun compounds composed of free lexemes, this individuationis signaled via a possessive relationship, a whole-part relationship, or qualification by acertain property; in the case of the bound nouns discussed above, the relationship
                                                                                            326
between them is likewise that of possessor-possessed or whole-part (or more loosely,an inherent association between two entities). The set of bound nouns in Hup thus bearsa resemblance to the class of inalienable nouns in the Australian language Mayali; Evans(1995) describes these as characterized by the existence of some other entity, a ‘whole’ towhich they belong or are associated. In Hup, these relationships between the componentsof the compound construction all entail that the N2 or head of the compound is definedand specified by the N1, or modifier. The functional relationship between thisindividuating function and the more general phenomena of definiteness and specificationis illustrated by the use of forms like tˆ¤h=/ãy, tˆ¤h=/i‚h (3sg-FEM ‘that woman’; 3sg-MSC‘that man’) in examples (96-97) above.","[342, 343]"
"This widespread reliance on plant parts in classification makes obvious sense vis-à-visthe Amazonian rainforest environment, which is characterized by an enormous variety ofplants, but a relatively scarcity of stone and other raw materials. Thus most Amazonianpeoples, like the Hupd’´h, rely heavily on plant parts as a source of raw materials formanufactured items. Their focus on this maximally salient part of their material world isborne out in the linguistic coding of their interaction with it.

6. The noun phrase: modification and definiteness       This chapter deals with issues relating to the noun phrase and its behavior withinthe clause, with a particular focus on modification and definiteness. While chapter 5dealt with the compound noun, an NP composed of two (or more) associated members ofthe open class of nouns, this chapter examines the closed classes of nominal modifiers—demonstratives, quantifiers, and adjectives—and their roles within the NP. In addition, itaddresses the ability of members of closed word classes to act as nominal heads in theirown right, occurring in lieu of a noun or noun phrase as the argument of a verb. A fewadditional non-nominal functions (adverbial, determiner, etc.) of these closed wordclasses (specifically interrogative pronouns and demonstratives) are briefly consideredhere as well. In the final section of this chapter, I also briefly introduce NP coordination.","[377, 378]"
"However, in certain cases the same root (i.e. the same segmental form) can occur as anoun, a verb, and/or an adjective. Because little or no derivational morphology may berequired to express a change in word class, it can sometimes be difficult to determinewhether one of these different word-class manifestations of a lexeme is more ‘basic’ thananother. In some cases these different manifestations are probably best considereddistinct lexical items; in others, zero derivations or polyvalent roots (i.e. distinguished atthe level of the grammar, not the lexicon; see also §4.6.1).
                                                                                          1543.1.1. NounsPrototypical members of the noun class are those roots that head noun phrases andtypically function as arguments of the clause. Unlike verbs, nouns can regularly appearbare in the clause, without any inflectional morphology or other associated formatives,and they contrast lexically for tone (see §2.3.2.2). Examples of nouns are given in (1-2):(1)    tˆnˆ‡h     mç‡m    nç¤h-ç¤h

       ‘He had shot two capuchin monkeys with his blowpipe.’ (M.NS.65)       Nouns and verbs are also distinguished by the formatives with which theycombine, and under what circumstances the formatives occur. Nouns regularly inflect forcase and number, whereas members of the verb class can only take case- and number-marking formatives when they are themselves nominalized or head adverbial clauses(where the case marker arguably has a distinct function from its usual one; see §18.2.6.2).","[170, 171]"
"        As noted in the noun phrase template in the introduction to this chapter, adjectivesfollow the nouns they modify. This is in contrast to other types of NPs containing amodifier: numerals, demonstratives, and compounded nouns precede the noun (but notethat locative adpositions, like adjectives, follow nouns; §10.2.3 below). Examples ofadjectival NPs are given in (119-121).

        ‘That one has a strong (loud) sound.’ (B.Cv.92)        Adjectives can take the verbal Negative suffix -nˆh not only when they are used aspredicates (see §10.1), but also when the adjective occurs within a noun phrase as amodifier, as in example (122) (a predicate nominal). Adjectival NPs can also be negatedby nominal negators that have scope over the whole NP (see chapter 16).

        Adjectives can also modify subordinate clauses (which are nominalizations;see §18.2), as in (123).

        ‘I have a lot to say today.’ (T.PN.23)        Non-predicate adjectives are obligatorily preceded by some nominal form. Whennot a full noun (as in the examples above), this may be a demonstrative (example 124) orsimilar form (such as the interrogative quantifier acting as indefinite pronoun; example125).

        ‘So many bad things, evil spirits, biciw spirits...’ (H.33)When an adjective occurs on its own as a nominal head, it is obligatorily preceded by thedefault preform tˆh=, elsewhere the 3sg pronoun, as in (126) (note that adjectives do notmodify pronouns in NPs). The only exception to this rule appears to be the form cípmQh‘small’ (cf. Diminutive =mQh, §7.2), which does not occur as a nominal head at all andcannot take tˆh= (and may be better considered a kind of quantifier; compare thealternative form tˆh=tQ‚êh(=mQh) ‘small’, which patterns like a normal adjective).

       ‘What (i.e. which color beads) do you want?’ (OS)       Stress and tone (word-accent) patterns for adjectival NPs are not fully consistentacross speakers and speech events. The underlying lexical tone value for adjectives isalmost always high tone, with the primary exception of bˆÙg ‘old’ (it is possible that thismay be at least partially motivated by the contrast with bˆêg ‘tapir’). In general, a nounphrase composed of [N Adj] is treated phonologically as a single lexical unit, withprimary stress on the second constituent. In the case of tˆh=Adj constructions, this stresspattern is quite consistent: tone always falls on the adjective and is realized as rising(except in the case of CV roots, which always have high tone). In NPs involving fulllexical nouns, on the other hand, tone on the adjective may vary. The pattern in lesscareful speech tends to favor a pattern like that of the tˆh= form (including rising tone onthe adjective), but in more careful speech (especially in cases of potential ambiguity, suchas when the speaker is confronted with a minimal pair set contrasting by tone), the nounmay receive equal stress and take tone. In these cases, the following adjective assumes
                                                                                               411
its underlying tonal value (and so is usually high). In at least one case, this generalpattern gives rise to a minimal pair contrast:
(128) tˆh=po‡g         (3sg=big)       ‘big one’
      tˆh póg          (lie big)       ‘liar’ (literally ‘big liar’, although tˆh by itself is not
                                       generally used in this sense)Note that this pattern for tˆh= adjectival NPs is consistent with the most frequent word-accent (stress/tone) pattern for bisyllabic (monomorphemic) lexical items in general (see§2.3.2), and bound nouns with tˆh= are also always stressed on the N2.","[425, 426, 427, 428]"
"        There is also evidence that the reinterpretation of the semantic head in theseclassifying compounds is being played out in the syntax of these constructions as well. Insome cases, the N1 of the construction is now arguably the syntactic head, as well as thesemantic head. The most likely force behind this change is lexical borrowing fromPortuguese and/or Tukano; this generated new terms, which Hup speakers would haveorganized according to the system already present in their language for dealing withmanufactured or manipulated items. However, since the new terms first came into thelanguage as independent monomorphemic nominals, they naturally assumed the functionof nominal heads, to which the classifying form was subsequently added. Given the large(and growing) number of these borrowed nominals, the classifying forms are graduallycoming to be perceived as something extra, tacked on to the main entity. In some cases,the presence of the classifier is in fact optional:
(171) píta (=b’ah)              ‘cassette tape’              (Port. fita=SPLIT.WOOD)
      mandádiya (=wˆg)          ‘medallion on necklace’      (Port. medalhão=SEED)
      wéda (=teg)               ‘candle’                     (Port. vela=STICK)
      badãêw (=tat)             ‘balloon’                    (Port. balão=FRUIT)        This ‘tacked-on’ effect of classifying terms is even found with a few nativewords, such as those in (172), in which the classifier appears optionally:
(172) nçg’Q‡d (=b’ah)           ‘tongue’     (tongue=SPLIT.WOOD)
      núh(=tat) pog             ‘a big head’ (head=FRUIT big)
                                (when emphasizing shape/size of head)
                                                                                           351
5.6.4.2. Functions of the Hup classifier system and the typology of noun classificationThe transitional appearance of the Hup classifier-like system brings us to the nextquestion: How do the Hup noun classifying terms fit into a general typology ofclassifiers? Below, I consider the various functions of the Hup classifier-like boundforms vis-à-vis the functions of noun classifiers cross-linguistically, and evaluate thearguments for characterizing the Hup case as an incipient noun classifier system.","[367, 368]"
"       The subject pronouns are here re-summarized in Table 6.1. As can be seen in themore detailed paradigm given in Table 4.1, §4.1.2, Hup pronouns—like nouns ingeneral—take basic inflectional and derivational forms relating to case, number, andpossession, as well as various bound focus and discourse-marking forms (chapter 7).",[379]
"A) DerivationTo the extent that the N1 members of compounds can be considered heads of the nounphrase, the classifying nouns—in cases where N1 is a verbal stem—can be understood tohave the derivational function of creating an object or instrument nominalization from theverb stem, as in (173). Such derivational functions are common for noun classifiers inother languages (see Aikhenvald 2000: 220), especially those of Western Amazonia(Grinevald and Seifart, forthcoming).
(173) wˆ‡/=teg            (listen=THING)         ‘thing for listening’ = ‘headphones’
      tác=tat             (kick=FRUIT)           ‘round for kicking’ = ‘soccer ball’
      kQ¤y b’uy-d’´‡h=hçb (trash throw-send=HOLLOW)
                                  ‘hollow for throwing out trash’ = ‘wheelbarrow’B) Anaphoric referenceOne of the most common functions of classifier terms in Hup is that of anaphoricreference, as in examples (174-76). Classifying nouns can refer anaphorically back to thefull compound (or directly to a physically present object) in constructions where the N1 isthe default/possessor form tˆh=, a demonstrative (174), a numeral (175), or a relative
                                                                                                  352
clause (176). An anaphoric function is a common feature of noun classifiersgenerally, especially in Amazonian languages (cf. Derbyshire and Payne 1990: 243).
(174) yˆ‚ê-n’ˆ‡h         hˆd     bˆ¤/-ˆ¤h,        núp=tat
        that.ITG-NMZ 3pl         work-DECL this=FRUIT
        ‘Thus they made it (a clay musical instrument), this size (round).’ (showing with
        hands) (H.22)(175) ka/ap=te‡g!
        two=STICK
        ‘(There are) two of them!’
        (watching flying airplanes: wayd’ó/=teg [fly=STICK])(176) nup      bóda=tat-/e‡/,        [núp d’çh-yQ¤t-Qp]=tat

        ‘This was a ball, this rotting round thing lying here.’ (EL)
        This anaphoric function is not specific to classifying nouns, however. In theirnon-semantically extended use, the plant-part forms and various other bound nouns canbe used for anaphoric reference in just the same way:
(177) do‡g=wˆg           b’ah-yó/… tˆh=wˆ¤g             wç‚t-d’´h-way-yó/
        vapisuna=seed    split-SEQ           3sg=seed   pull.out-send-go.out-SEQ
        ‘Having split a vapisuna seed, having pulled the seed’s insides out…’ (H.15)(178) deh=mí          ke‡y=d’´h        hám=b’ay-áh,           cãêp=mí         pQ¤-ay-áh
        water=river     see=PL         go=AGAIN-DECL another=river            go.upstream-INCH-DECL
        ‘They went again to see the river, and went up another river.’ (LG.C.15)        With relative clauses, numerals, and demonstratives, the bound or classifier formmay be interchangeable with a distinct monomorphemic head noun, depending on howspecific the speaker chooses to be, as in (179). However, the slot cannot be filled by afull compound if a bound form is available. Thus either the lexeme cug’Q‡t ‘leaf, paper,
                                                                                           353

               ‘The one I saw climbed up.’
C) AgreementHup classifying terms can arguably serve a marginal agreement-marking function byvirtue of appearing, optionally, on multiple constituents of the clause (as with noun classmarking in Bantu, for example), as in (180). This concord has been identified byGrinevald (2002) as a hallmark of a true nominal classification system. However, thisagreement-like phenomenon is extremely rare in natural discourse in Hup (beingconfined mostly to elicitation contexts), and may be better characterized as apposition ofdistinct noun phrases, rather than as marking concord within a single noun phrase.
(180) núp=(g’Qt) pˆhˆ¤t=g’Qt              tˆh=po‡g=(g’Qt)
       this=FRUIT      pineapple=FRUIT    3sg=big=FRUIT
       ‘this big pineapple’ (EL)
An incipient classifier systemTypologically, the Hup system is best characterized as an incipient classifier or ‘classterm’ system (cf. DeLancey 1986, Grinevald 2000). It falls near the lexical end of theGrinevald’s proposed scale of classifier grammaticalization:
                                                                                         354               <Lexical------------------------Grammatical>
               measure terms                 noun classes—gender
               class termsThe arguments for considering the Hup system to be incipient are the following.   a) Only a small subset of Hup bound nouns—and even of plant-part terms—are       consistently used in metaphorically extended ways (see the list in 150 above).   b) For the most part, the contexts of semantic extension have to do with newly       introduced cultural items, and the influx of these items is a relatively recent       phenomenon—the majority have become available within the lifetime of adult       speakers. Some bound nouns appear to have been only recently extended in       semantically specific ways, in order to classify a particular variety of new item;       the best example of this is leaf Æ book.   c) The bound classifier nouns have undergone little grammaticalization and       essentially no phonological reduction; they are all recognizable nouns that can act       as heads elsewhere (cf. the incipient classifier systems in some Australian       languages (e.g. Reid 1997, Wilkins 2000, Grinevald 2000: 84).   d) The classifying terms are used for derivation (see §5.7.4.2A), but are used only       minimally for agreement-marking purposes (§5.7.4.2C).   e) The presence of the classifying form is sometimes optional in the NP (see §5.6.4.1       above), and is absent altogether from most nouns in Hup.","[368, 369, 370, 371]"
"Like the corresponding questions, responses like those in (25) are likely to bepragmatically equivalent, and are formally differentiated only by stress.(25)   (a)        hˆ‡/=teg

                  ‘(I’m) going to write.’       The semi-nominal identity of Future -teg / -te- in Hup may also explain itsungrammaticality in negative clauses. Since Hup uses a different strategy for negatingnominal entities than for negating verbal clauses (see chapter 16), it is in fact predictable
                                                                                                       722
that an intermediate form like teg would pattern irregularly in negated contexts. Thisis supported by the fact that it is not only the verbal form of teg that is irregular whennegated, but the nominal form as well. On the one hand, a possessed nominalization with=teg undergoes normal existential negation just like any other noun:

          1sg.POSS        sit=thing           NEG:EX
        ‘My seat (log for sitting) is not here/ does not exist.’ (EL)(27)    [[nˆ‡            hç‚Ùp]   pãÙ]
        1sg.POSS         fish     NEG:EX
        ‘My fish is not here/ does not exist.’ (EL)However, while most nouns can also appear with existential negation in predicatenominal clauses with no overt copula, as in (28), nominal constructions with =teg areungrammatical when they appear with a nominative pronoun in the same type ofconstruction, as illustrated in (29); compare (29) to (26) above, where the only surfacedifference is the form of the pronoun.
(28)    /ãêh [[hç‚Ùp] pãÙ]
        1sg       fish          NEG:EX

          1sg    sit=thing            NEG:EX
          ‘I am without a sitting-thing.’ (EL)Instead, the only grammatical form of this expression requires a verbal stress pattern, incombination with a constituent negator, as in example (30). A verbal clause has beenproduced from a copula-less predicate nominal clause—but it is a peculiar verbal clause,

  Note, however, that the Perfective aspect and other markers can also attach directly to the question word
‘what’, so this form with teg is not completely irregular vis-à-vis other verbal suffixes in Hup.

since the Existence Negator pãÙ is usually ungrammatical with verbs. Moreover, theinterpretation of (30) is as ambiguous between noun and verb as is its form, since ‘I havenothing to sit on’ is pragmatically equivalent to ‘I will sit on nothing’.

       1sg    sit-thing/FUT?   NEG:EX
       ‘I have nothing to sit on.’ (EL)       The historical scenario discussed here is also supported by comparative evidence,since cognates for the lexeme ‘wood, stick’ can be identified in at least two otherNadahup languages (Yuhup tég and Nadeb t´´g; cf. Ospina 2002 and Weir 1984), but nosimilar future marker appears to exist. Moreover, a bound form -teg exists in Yuhup aspurpose marker (Ospina, p.c.). Finally, a likely motivating force for the development ofthe future gram in Hup comes from Tukano, which not only has an explicit future tense,but has been shown to have motivated the development of future marking in theneighboring Arawak language Tariana (Aikhenvald 2002).","[738, 739, 740]"

Thus post-verbally one typically findsthe Intangible forms yúw-úh and yˆ-d’´‡h-´¤h, rather than tˆ¤h-ˆ¤h and hˆ¤d-ˆ¤h (example 1).(1)     naw-nˆ¤h mún /u‚h-mQh-ní-íy                    bˆ¤g     yˆ-d’´‡h-´¤h!

        ‘There are always loads of them fighting!’ (TD.Cv.28)        When they precede the verb in the clause, subject pronouns in Hup are typicallyimmediately preposed to the verb. They appear to be developing a marginallyprocliticized status: in this position, they are unstressed, and in the Umari Norte dialectthe third person singular pronoun (the most frequent in narrative) is phonologicallydependent on its verbal host in some contexts (undergoing loss of final [h] andassimilating the vowel of the verb stem), as example (2) illustrates. This process mayrepresent the incipient development of cross-referencing prefixes in the verb.(2)      yˆ‚ê-nˆ¤h-ˆ¤y                ta-way-máh-ah,          mi‡h-íh,     ta‡h   tç‚-/ç‚êh-ç‚t-çê‚h

        (RA.MJ.58)        As in most languages, Hup pronouns (including their possessive variants, as inexample 3) are deictic forms that occur as arguments of predicates, in lieu of a nounphrase; they refer anaphorically to an entity that would otherwise be indicated by a fullNP, or else refer deictically to the physical context.(3)     tˆh=po‡g         tˆnˆ‡h-ˆ¤h

  Such double-duty of a demonstrative form is quite common cross-linguistically; Diessel (1999: 119)
observes that third person pronouns often derive historically from pronominal demonstratives.
                                                                                               364           Hup discourse relies heavily on pronouns. Any constituent may be referred toanaphorically by a pronoun (or by a demonstrative, see below) if its referent can berecovered from the context. The principal protagonist in a narrative is often referred toexclusively by the third person singular pronoun tˆh for the entire story. Even within thesame clause, it is common to refer to multiple participants with the same third personpronoun. In (4), one participant is a subject and one an object; here case marking andcontext are enough to differentiate the referents. In (5), the first instance of tˆh= refersanaphorically to ‘her husband’—introduced as such immediately afterwards—and thesecond tˆh= refers back to the spirit woman who was the subject of the previous clause.

"Addition of the bound preform tˆh= to adjective modifiers also produces anominalization, as discussed in §6.6. Finally, as covered in §18.2.5, the form -n’ˆ‡hfollows verb stems and nominalizes entire clauses, which usually appear as complements(example 175).

5. The complex noun: compounding, possession, and noun
classification       Hup has several strategies for combining full nouns, pronouns, or nominalelements into complex or compound nouns (i.e. noun combinations that act as phrasalconstituents). Syntactically, all involve the juxtaposition of two or more nominalcomponents, and these combinations serve a range of semantic functions. The slotsequence for the Hup complex noun is the following:               (Possessor [+Alienable possession marker]) [N1...[N1 N2]]       On the most basic, productive level, we find simple noun compounding, whichcan be used to express several distinct relationships between the associated entities. Theexpression of alienable possession likewise involves the combination of nouns in an NP,but in this case the possessor is crucially marked with an additional possessivemorpheme. Hup also has a heterogeneous set of obligatorily bound and/or inalienablypossessed nouns, which must occur in a compound construction, preceded by some othernominal element. Finally, a subset of these bound nouns occur in combination with othernouns and serve a primarily classificatory function, by which they categorize the nounthey occur with on the basis of some abstract semantic component.","[294, 295]"
"       It should also be noted here that while almost all generic nouns referring tohumans are obligatorily bound (usually preceded by the default 3sg pronoun tˆh=), they(like most other bound nouns) may appear unbound in plural form. For example, theform tã/ãêy ‘woman (sg)’ (a reduced form of tˆh=/ãêy, involving the bound noun =/ãêy)can appear as /ãêy=d’´h in the plural, as in example (115). The explanation for this
                                                                                            258
phenomenon lies in the individuating function of the bound construction, as discussedin §5.5; this is essentially incompatible with generic semantics.

B. AnimalsNumber marking is common on nouns referring to animals, as in examples (116-18), butit may be absent (examples 119-20). In general, an animal-referring noun that isconceptually plural but lacks number marking is judged grammatical by speakers,whereas most human nouns in this context are not. In discourse, the presence or absenceof number marking on animal nouns patterns according to specificity; more specificreferences to animals are usually marked, whereas more generic references are not—thisis especially typical for game animals, as in (119-120). This is consistent with the patternof differential object marking on animal nouns (§4.3.1.2), as well as with the absence ofnumber marking on certain generic human nouns, as in examples (109-110) above.

C. InanimatesAlthough number marking is not ungrammatical on countable nouns with inanimatereferents (unlike object marking), these nouns are almost always formally unmarked fornumber in discourse, as illustrated in (124-29). This is the case regardless of whether ornot number is otherwise specified with a numeral or other quantifier. Like non-specifichumans and animals, inanimate entities are typically of relatively low conceptualsalience, and differentiation for number is thus apparently of low importance.

4.4.2. Number and other noun types: demonstratives, numerals, and pronounsAs nominal heads referring to non-singular entities, demonstratives occur as thelexicalized free-pronoun forms nˆ-d’´‡h ‘these’, n’i-d’´‡h ‘those (distal)’, and yˆ-d’´‡h‘those (intangible)’ (see Table 4.2 in §4.1.2 above), as in examples (131-32). Note thatthe lexicalized stress pattern of these forms results in stress falling on the Plural marker,whereas =d’´h is always unstressed elsewhere in Hup. The Plural marker can also occurwith various other derived demonstrative forms, such as that in (133). It is important tonote that the combination of a bound demonstrative morpheme with the Plural markerresults in a nominalization; in other words, =d’´h has a nominalizing effect on theseforms.(131) /´‡g=wag        nˆ-d’´‡h   nˆh-nˆ¤h-ay=pog’,          páy-ay

When occurring within an NP, the (DEM + d’´h) forms above are usuallyrestricted to animate referents, and can only modify an inanimate referent when theinanimate-referring noun is explicitly number-marked with =d’´h (which, as we haveseen, is almost never the case in natural discourse). For inanimate referents,corresponding fused forms built on the nominalizer -n’ˆ‡h (see §4.6.3 below and §18.2.5)are used. These (DEM + n’ˆh) forms are realized as nˆ-n’ˆ‡h ‘these’, n’i-n’ˆ‡h ‘those (DST)’,and yˆ‚-n’ˆ‡h ‘those (ITG)’, and are never used for animate referents. For a countableinanimate noun like ‘fruit’, the -n’ˆ‡h demonstrative form requires a plural interpretation;thus nˆ-n’ˆ‡h=tat means ‘these fruits’, whereas núp=tat means ‘this fruit’ (compare nˆ-d’´‡h dó/=d’´h ‘these children’). For a mass noun, the demonstrative may be eitherinanimate plural or singular; e.g. nˆ-n’ˆ‡h j’ˆ‡k; núp j’ˆ‡k ‘this smoke’.","[274, 275, 276, 277, 278, 279]"
"       The ‘has a sibling’ strategy is clearly a widespread areal phenomenon, although itdoes not appear to be a more generally cross-linguistically common strategy forrepresenting ‘four’ (cf. studies of numeral etymologies, e.g. Blaz‡ek 1999). It is possiblethat the ‘fraternal’ tally system present in Dâw might once have been a more widespreadstrategy, later superseded (in some cases) by a base-five system (also probably a tallysystem). There may also be a cultural explanation for the equation of ‘four’ with twopairs of siblings: in the Vaupés region (and beyond it), having and living among one’sactual and classificatory siblings is culturally extremely important; these are one’s fellowclan members (and in the case of the Vaupés River Indians, the fellow speakers of one’slanguage). Moreover, as Pozzobon (1997: 167) points out, sister-exchange is the ideal
                                                                                                         398
marriage pattern in the region, in part because this allows spouses to return to thecommunity of one of their parents; thus if a person has an opposite-sex sibling, he/she ismore likely to find a partner. This involves two sets of two; two married pairs ofsiblings—four individuals. Thus there is a culturally highly salient reason to associatethe quantity 3 with a ‘failed’ set (‘without a sibling’) and 4 with a full set (‘has asibling’).99         Hup and Yuhup closely fit the Vaupés areal profile in having language-specificlexical forms for 1-3, a calqued form of ‘has a sibling/ is accompanied’ for ‘four’, andterms based on hands and feet for five and up. Interestingly, the range of numeralstrategies across the family corresponds to their geographical proximity to the Vaupésregion: Nadëb (the most distant) has lexical forms for 1-3; Dâw (peripheral) adds aminimally lexical ‘fraternal’ system for 4-10; and Hup and Yuhup have these strategiesplus a base-five system for 5-10. The current systems in Hup and Yuhup may representhistorical layers of developing complexity, which are currently reflected in geographicaldistribution (across the Nadahup languages) as well as diachronically. I therefore suggestthe following stages of development for the Hup and Yuhup numeral systems:     1) A basic 1-3 system (like that found in Nadëb);
     2) Adoption of a minimally productive ‘fraternal’ system (like the one in Dâw);
     3) Adoption of a base-five system (probably borrowed from the Tukanoan
        languages); this would have stranded ‘four’, giving it a specific quantitative value

"       Many of the markers discussed in this section have already been encountered inprevious sections of this grammar. These have other uses that are distinct or onlymarginally related to their clause-linking functions, and as such they may also occur onindependent clauses and even on clausal constituents. While doubt can rarely becompletely eliminated as to whether they are polysemous (either synchronically ordiachronically) or homonymous, polysemy often appears to be motivated semantically,and is certainly in keeping with the high level of polysemy found among forms in Hupgenerally. Where these forms are addressed in this chapter, their other uses arementioned, and cross-references are made to the appropriate sections in other chapters.

18.1. CoordinationHup has a number of strategies for indicating a conceptual link between two clauses,where both are on the same syntactic level and neither is dependent on the other. Thesestrategies include simple juxtaposition of linked elements, as well as additional

morphological means for signaling the relation between them. In some cases, theclause-level strategies can also apply to linked phrases or constituents within the clause.","[983, 984, 985]"
"       A headless relative clause nominalized by the Object marker is given in example(69). Significantly, the use of the Object marker in headless relative clauses isirrespective of the animacy or number of the referent, whereas differential object marking(whereby singular inanimate nouns are never Object-marked; see §4.3.1.2) applies to

most other nouns in Hup. Elsewhere in Hup, the Object marker -a‡n appears only as acase marker on nominals (but cf. the directional oblique form -an, used both for nominalsand in adverbial clauses; see §18.2.6.2).

       ‘John broke the one (i.e. a stick) with which I was making mingau.’ (EL)       A headless relative clause nominalized by the Oblique marker is provided inexample (70). Note, however, that the Oblique suffix used with relative clauses is avariant of the more standard vowel-copying Oblique form -Vêt; it appears obligatorily as-ˆ¤t.200 Some speakers pronounce it consistently as nasal (regardless of the nasality of thestem); others as oral. Elsewhere in Hup, both variants of the Oblique marker (-Vêt and-Vw-ˆ¤t) attach to the verb stem and form adverbial-type clauses relating to location, time,and manner (see §18.2.6.2 below).

The case suffix may also follow the Plural marker=d’´h (which, as noted above, can be considered a sub-type of head nominal akin to abound noun); the Plural =d’´h + Object -a‡n combination usually appears in the fused

"       Corbett (2000: 118) observes that collectives derived from pronouns appear to bevery rare in the world’s languages, but the Hup collective pronoun construction doesseem to be a bona fide collective in Corbett’s sense of a group of items “consideredtogether as a unit”. As the examples below illustrate, the collective is not spatial so muchas conceptual; it is usually used in reference to an ethnic group, as distinct from a morecontextually defined group of referents (which would be referred to with the simplepronominal form).

4.4.3. Uncountable or mass nounsInanimate nouns conceived as a mass cannot, in general, receive plural marking at all(whereas countable inanimate nouns usually do not, but in principle can):

       farinha=REP farinha take-SEQ        drink-DEP NEG:ID
       ‘A little farinha, having taken farinha (and) drinking; not doing this.’ (T.PN.22)       An inanimate mass noun can be made countable by specifying a unit; this isusually done by means of a bound noun (see §5.4), as in the following example:
(149) peyãêw             ‘beans’
      peyãêw=wˆg         ‘bean seed’ (=individual bean)
      peyãêw=tat         ‘bean fruit’ (=bean pod)For a few mass nouns, the plural marker may in fact be grammatical, but only in acollective-type sense:
                                                                                                       266(150) pãÙt                ‘hair’

      pãÙt=d’´h           ‘lots of hair’        The use of measure terms (which are frequently bound nouns) is required whenmass nouns are modified with numerals, as in examples (151-52).
(151) ko/ap b’ç‡/         d’u‡ç    deh tˆh /´g-yˆ¤/-ay-áh,                 ko/ap b’ç‡/

                 she gave all this.’ (P.txt.93)This use of measure terms has a formal parallel in the common (though not obligatory)use of noun classifiers or other bound nouns when numerals modify countable inanimatenouns, as in examples (153-54). This supports the notion that nouns unmarked fornumber in Hup are conceptually akin to mass nouns; in the same way, it suggests that thefunction of the bound construction—and more specifically, the noun classifiers—is oneof individuation, closely linked to that of measure terms (see §5.5-6).64(153) /ˆ¤n-a‡n cúku          tˆh nç¤/-ç¤h,       bodáca        /óytu=b’ah

        two=THING
        ‘Two of them!’ (helicopters: pˆpˆh=teg) (OS)

  Also compare the use of the ‘singulative’ bound noun =/ãêw ‘swarming insect’ (§4.4.1.B above) with
mass-like insect nouns, and the obligatory participation of human nouns in the bound construction (§5.4.2
and §5.5).
                                                                                                         267        Finally, there are a few other uncountable nouns in Hup which are trulyconceptually unitary, rather than simply uncountable; these include páç ‘sky’ and pQ‚êy‘thunder/lightning’.654.4.4. Number marking and the noun phraseIn the noun phrase, number marking—like object marking—generally occurs on the finalelement of the NP. However, if the plural-marked noun is preceded by a demonstrative,the demonstrative is virtually always number-marked as well, as in example (155).","[281, 282, 283, 284]"
"While the above discussion has argued that the bound noun and the adjectival NP cannotbe considered the same construction synchronically, it is very likely that they arehistorically and/or functionally related. Typological work has shown that there is cross-linguistic precedent for the grammaticalization of a possessive marker to an attributivemarker (e.g. in Oceanic languages, Ross 1998; Rießler 2004); in a number of cases, such
                                                                                         418
as in Ural-Altaic languages (cf. Rießler 2004), intermediate stages apparently includea nominalizer, marker of definiteness, and marker of anaphoric-demonstrative focus. InHup, as this discussion has shown, one and the same marker tˆh= has the role of a markerof inalienable possession (and individuation, related to definiteness) with nouns, and ofnominalization and—to some degree—focus and attribution with adjectives.","[434, 435]"

   Corresponding to a general morphophonological process in Hup, an epenthetic glottal stop or
homorganic consonant marks the morpheme/ syllable boundary, here and in all other cases (including the
demonstratives in the tables below) where a bound form precedes an obstruent-initial inflectional
morpheme (see §2.6). The glottal stop is not written in the transcription.

   This use of hˆ‚ with the verb ‘be like’ occurs in the Tat Deh dialect area, but not in that of Barreira Alta,
where speakers use hˆ‚pê =yˆ/ nˆ¤h- instead.

"5.2. Alienable possessionLike noun compounding, the expression of possession in Hup involves the conjunction oftwo nouns into a noun phrase. Most Hup nouns are non-obligatorily or alienablypossessed; that is, they can appear by themselves as complete NPs. When these nounsare possessed by another entity, an additional morphological marker of the possessiverelationship is required. This is the postpostional particle nˆ‡h (which receives stress andrising tone); this marker is associated with the possessor (phonologically so in the case ofpronouns), and usually precedes the possessum, as in examples (29-30). (Note that thisform is homonymous with the clausal Negative suffix -nˆ‡h.)

"           The interjection-type use of hãêy is illustrated in (173), where the speaker uses it tocorrect himself when he absent-mindedly called someone by the wrong name. Note thesimilarity between this use and that of Protestive bá/ for self-correction (§15.3.5) inexample (154) above.(173) páti, hãêy, wáwdu

Interestingly, the ability of hãêyto take object case and number marking is governed by the animacy of the referent, justas it is for any normal noun. This suggests that even though the speaker has a mentalblock on the word itself, information pertaining to the animacy and number of thereferent is still available.179(174) hãêy-ãêt, tegc´‡h-´¤t             tˆh   mçnQ-yó/=mah

In (180), it is not clear what verb the speaker intended to put in the place of hãêy;in (181), the missing verb stem may be hup-hipãh- ‘be conscious’, as in the secondverb—if this is the case, then it is interesting that hãêy occurs first in the compound, rather

InterjectionsAs a category, interjections in Hup are only one step removed from the set of clause-finaldiscourse particles discussed in §15.3. Like many of the discourse particles, Hupinterjections have a primarily affective and stylistic function, and are phonologically andmorphosyntactically independent—but they are considerably more grammatically,semantically, and phonologically self-contained than the discourse markers. Twosubtypes of interjection can be distinguished on formal grounds: those that areobligatorily associated with a preceding clause, and those that can stand alone as a freeutterance.","[879, 880, 881]"
"       The Hup locative postpositions fall into two sets, based primarily on theirmorphological properties. The forms in the first set, given in Table 10.1, are relativelyheterogeneous. They are all morphologically frozen forms, although some appear tocontain identifiable inflectional markers that occur elsewhere in the language (such asDirectional/object -an, Locative có/, Sequential -yo/, Telic/adverbial =yˆ/, and Measure=tQn). Most can also take additional inflectional markers, particularly Directional -anand Locative có/, and the Diminutive intensifier =mQh can follow the locativepostposition to emphasize closeness in the spatial relationship; e.g. ‘just above’, ‘justbelow’, etc. (see §15.1.4). The postpositions in this set are akin to adjective modifiers orbound nouns, in that they follow nouns in noun phrases, and case marking and otherinflection occurs NP-finally. The locative NP as a whole typically functions adverbially.",[585]
"       Given the multiple positions which number marking can fill in the NP, it isgrammatically possible to get number marking on every element of an NP (with theexception of a possessor). It is not altogether clear, however, whether this phenomenon
                                                                                                              269
should be taken as multiple appositional NPs, or as an actual (although extremelymarginal) case of agreement within the noun phrase; but it is clear that each of thenumber-marked elements has its own distinct nominal identity (compare the similarphenomenon found with noun classifiers, discussed in §5.6.4).

4.4.5. Number marking and the relative clauseThe (clause-final) boundary slot of a relative clause is typically filled by a bound noun,which—in the case of animate referents—is most often the masculine or gender-neutralbound noun =/i‚h (although it can also be the feminine form =/ãêy). Given the fact thatnumber marking typically does not occur on nominals with inanimate referents at all,most plural-marked relative clauses therefore involve the plural equivalent of =/i‚h. Inthese cases, the number marker =d’´h usually replaces both the bound noun =/i‚h (asmentioned above in §4.4.1.A), but also the Dependent marker -Vp of the relativized verb.","[285, 286]"
"Example (164) comes from a telling of Mercer Meyer’s The Frog Story, in which the boywas accompanied (and even assisted) by his dog in his search for his missing frog.

       ‘He went (in vain), together with his dog.’ (FS.2)       Finally, -and’´h can function as a kind of ‘inclusory plural’ form: it occurs on thesecond of two coordinated participants to indicate their association with each other, vis-à-vis the event specified in the predicate—even where the first is a plural pronoun like‘we’ that subsumes both referents, as in example (165). In this usage, the Associativeplural does not indicate a group that acts independently, as one of two distinctparticipants; rather, this form crucially has to do with the interaction between the twonamed participants. This use is especially common with the reciprocal/ interactivepluractional construction (see §9.3).

Comparative Note       Several aspects of the number-marking system in Hup may be identifiable as arealfeatures common to Vaupés languages in general. In particular, both Tukanoanlanguages and Tariana (apparently under Tukanoan influence) distinguish pluralprimarily for humans and animates (Aikhenvald 2002: 96), as does Hup. In addition, an‘associative plural’ form that is functionally similar to that found in Hup occurs in anumber of Tukanoan languages, as well as in Tariana, into which it is argued to havespread by diffusion (Aikhenvald 2002: 98). The fact that the Hup form appears to bemorphologically transparent—involving the combination of the Object (or Directional)
                                                                                           272
marker -an and the Plural form =d’´h—also suggests that it may be a relatively newgrammatical category in the language, and therefore a likely candidate for a diffusionalorigin (from Tukano into Hup). Moreover, although the ‘associative plural’ forms inTukano and Tariana are both derived from these languages’ respective words for ‘also’,they resemble the Hup form in that all three share a final syllable that is identical to theplural marker in these languages.","[287, 288, 289]"
"        Declarative verb-final constituent order is illustrated in the intransitive clauses in(7-8). As these examples show, intransitive (and also transitive) clauses are frequentlyinitiated by an adverbial word or clause (often denoting temporal sequence), followed bythe subject, and finally the verb.

In cases where there areabsolutely no other clues to the identity of subject and object, Hup speakers prefer AOVconstituent order, which suggests that this order is in some sense the most basic:

                 ‘The jaguar kills the snake.’ (EL)It is, however, extremely rare for constituent order to be the only clue to the identity ofsubject and object in a transitive clause, even in elicitation contexts. Grammatical objectsthat are human entities, pronouns, and NPs involving demonstratives are obligatorilymarked with Object case in Hup (see §4.3.1.1), so their identity as subject or object isalways clear. On the other hand, inanimate entities in object function are not generallyobject-marked; yet inanimate entities can hardly ever be interpreted as agents, hencehardly ever as subjects, so this lack of object marking rarely leads to confusion. Cases ofpotential ambiguity are therefore for the most part limited to interactions between twoanimal entities, for which object marking is optional. Even in these cases, if context-
                                                                                               910
related clues to the identity of the participants are inadequate or lacking, speakersprefer to use the optional case markers rather than simply to rely on constituent order.","[925, 926, 927]"
"6.5.2. Distributive pˆ¤d as a quantifierLike many morphological forms in Hup, the particle pˆ¤d is multifunctional and extremelypromiscuous in its combinations with various parts of speech. In general, it can beunderstood to have the basic function of signaling multiple realizations of some focusedentity or attribute. Following a nominal argument, pˆ¤d indicates multiple instances of theargument vis-à-vis the predicate; i.e. it acts as a quantifier, as in examples (85-86).

       With human referents, an alternative quantifier to pˆ¤d is the form hupnç¤ ‘eachperson’; this idiomatic form appears to be composed of hup Reflexive or ‘human’ and nç‘say’ (or ‘mouth’). The two forms may be used interchangeably, as in (91), or may co-occur, as in (92). Note the use of a classifying noun with pˆ¤d in (91b) (i.e. ‘bananas, onefruit apiece’), as in (85) above; this is not generally the case with hupnç¤.

       (LG.O.31)       The quantifier function of pˆ¤d is only one manifestation of its basic identity as amarker of multiplicity. Its various other uses are discussed at length in §12.9.1; forexample, when it follows a predicate (whether verbal or nominal), pˆ¤d indicates arepeated instance of the event or of the entity (i.e. ‘also’, ‘respectively’, ‘some/many’), asin examples (93-95). The overlap between this use and the quantifier function of pˆ¤d isillustrated by (95).

6.5.3. Other quantifiersThe ‘quantity’ marker /a‡p102 usually appears as a bound form, which—as discussedabove—appears with the bound demonstrative and interrogative particles to form otherquantity-related expressions, such as hˆ‚-/a‡p ‘how many?’, ya/a‡p [yˆ-/a‡p] ‘several, that102
      This form is homonymous with the ‘negative identity’ particle /a‡p.

many’ (and ya/a‡p-ay [INCH] ‘all gone’), etc. It also occurs in the cardinal numeralsko/a‡p ‘two’ and mç¤ta/a‡p ‘three’ (literally ‘eye-quantity’ and ‘rubber-tree-seed-quantity’), and can optionally occur with other cardinal numerals as well, as in example(97).

This quantifier acts likean adjective in that it can follow the noun or pronoun that it modifies (as in examples 98-100), but it can also occur by itself as a nominal head (example 100). Objects modifiedby /a‡pyˆ/ do not take case marking.

        ‘They gave him everything (on that day) that deer also eat today.’ (I-M.16)        A semantically similar (and usually interchangeable) quantifier is the form nihu‚ê/‘all, all kinds’, a deverbal form of the compounded roots ni-hu‚/- ‘be-finish’. Like/a‡pyˆ/, it can modify a preceding noun or stand alone as a nominal head, as illustrated in
                                                                                              404
examples (101-103). Objects modified by nihu‚ê/ (such as the plural ‘animals’ inexample 101) typically do not take the object marker, and consultants differ as to whetherthis is grammatically possible. The quantifiers nihu‚ê/ and /a‡pyˆ/ can co-occur to producean emphatic statement, as in (103).(101) hu‚ê=d’´h nihu)ê/=mah tˆh hitQê/‚ -Qê‚h

       ‘I took matches, I took rice, all of every kind of food…’ (LG.)       Another commonly used quantifier is b’ˆ¤yˆ/ ‘all, only’. This form probablyincludes the Telic (contrastive focus) form =yˆ/ (like /a‡pyˆ/ ‘all’), but in this case thefirst syllable b’ˆ cannot be identified as a morpheme by speakers. The quantifier b’ˆ¤yˆ/has two subtly different usage patterns: following the focused constituent of the clause(this constituent may itself be a complement clause, as in (110) below), it indicates ‘only’(i.e. an exclusive group involving that entity), whereas when postposed to the predicate ofa main clause it produces an ‘all’ interpretation (i.e. an inclusive group relating to thepredication). The following elicited paradigm illustrates this formal and functionaldistinction:
(104) a)       [/ˆn] b’ˆ¤yˆ/    teghç‚ê-nçg’o‡d     /ˆ¤d-ˆ¤y

                ‘We all speak Portuguese.’ (EL)Further examples of the ‘only’ function of b’ˆ¤yˆ/ are given in (105-9). Note that thequantifier itself can take the Inchoative suffix -ay to form a predication ‘be only, bealone’ (examples 105-6), and that objects modified by b’ˆyˆ/ do take the object marker(unlike most other quantifiers; example 109). This quantifier is also commonlyencountered in the expression /ayup b’ˆ¤yˆ/ ‘only one’ (essentially the same meaning as/ayu‡p=yˆ/).

In example (110), b’ˆ¤yˆ/ (in its ‘only’ function as nominal modifier) has scope over anentire complement clause.

       ‘We all speak (Hup).’ (Ronaldo P.-Int.)       The quantifier d´¤b ‘many, much’ likewise occurs as both a nominal modifier(where it inflects much like an adjective) and a nominal head. It is usually used todescribe a large quantity of discrete objects (multiplicity), rather than a mass amount(example 114), and occurs in at least one lexicalized construction (mumu‡y d´b [lit. ‘armmany’] ‘lower part of hand including fingers’).(114) yˆkán           d´¤b=yˆ¤/-ay=cud, tQ‚êh       d´¤b=yˆ¤/-ay=cud

It can occur as a predicate (whether nominalor adjective; examples 115-18), and can take verbal negation, as in example (117) and thequantifying expression d´b-nˆ¤h=mQh (many-NEG=DIM) ‘a few’.

6.6. Adjectival modifiersAs discussed in §3.1.3 and §10.1, adjectives in Hup can be defined as a distinct wordclass on the basis of their formal properties. Nevertheless, as predicates they share manyproperties with verbs—in particular, the ability to take aspectual inflection and verbal
                                                                                          408
negation—while as modifiers of nominal arguments, they share a number ofproperties with the sub-class of bound nouns in Hup. This section is devoted to adiscussion of adjectives in the noun phrase, where they appear both as nominal modifiersand as nominalized heads.","[416, 417, 418, 419, 420, 421, 422, 423, 424, 425]"

Bound nouns and semantic extension: noun ‘classification’As we have seen, obligatorily bound nouns relating to plant parts, eggs, and other entitiestend to occur in paradigmatic sets, and individuate a referent out of a mass of potentialreferents. As such, particularly in the case of plant parts, the bound construction typicallyserves a classifying function—types of leaves, types of wood, types of feathers, etc. Thebound N1 and N2 correspond either to a whole and its parts, or to two entities in apossessor-possessed or otherwise inherently associated relationship.","[351, 352]"

Indefinite Associative /u‡y (‘who’)The ‘Indefinite Associative’ construction involves the attachment of the interrogativepronoun /u‡y ‘who’ to a noun N, usually following an intervening Directional/Object casemarker (-Vêt or -a‡n), to indicate ‘a person from N, associated with N’. This use of ‘who’is probably linked to the more general function of interrogative pronouns to markindefinite reference (see §6.4); however, it is more grammaticalized. In the IndefiniteAssociative construction, /u‡y is typically pronounced [du‡y] due to assimilation with thepreceding dental stop [t] or [n] of the case marker. Some speakers maintain thisassimilation even in slow speech, and do not even recognize a connection between thisform of /u‡y and the interrogative pronoun.108         The Indefinite Associative construction almost always contains a case marker;this is usually the Object (or possibly the Directional oblique) form -an (71), but in manycases the Oblique -Vêt is also acceptable (examples 72-73). There are also a very fewexamples of this construction where no case marker is present, as in (74) below (note thatin this environment /u‡y is not pronounced [du‡y]). Finally, the construction is almostalways followed by a bound nominal form; this is usually the masculine, feminine, or108
   According to the morphophonological parameters defined for Hup formatives in §3.4, the peripheral
formative /uÙy should be labeled a postpositional ‘particle’, rather than an ‘enclitic’, because it receives

In (78), forexample, it combines with the noun ‘clothes’ to mean ‘a person characterized by havinglots of clothes’. The Indefinite Associative can also occur with a numeral to produce ameaning similar to that of the Associative plural construction (see §4.4.6), as in (79).

This is illustrated in the following examples, which also display some ofthe semantic variations of the Indefinite Associative. In (82), the construction occurs inconnection with a time period, apparently to convey a sense of approximation;consultants say that -an-/uy would be inappropriate for a more exact expression of thetime period.host.

        ‘Where did those twenty go?’ (P.Sp.107)        In the case of NPs involving numerals, number marking is preferred on both thenumeral and the remainder of the NP (especially for human referents), and appears to berequired if the numeral follows the rest of the NP (which probably means that these are infact two distinct appositional NPs):(156) mç¤ta/a‡p(=d’´h) tiyi‡/          po‡g=d’´h

distinct meanings, which are countable—for example, pa‡ç also means ‘rock’, and pQ‚êy is the name of a
species of fish.

However, the noun and its modifier can also occur as two appositional nominalforms with number marked on both, as in [tiyi‡/]=d’´h [tˆh=po‡g]=d’´h ‘the men, bigones’. In this case, the bound nominalizing form tˆh= is required on the adjective.

Some quantifiers (in particular, d´¤b ‘many’ and nihu‚ê/‘all’) are nevertheless able to take the plural marker =d’´h (although others, such as/ápyˆ/ ‘all’, cannot), with the same variable combinations as those described in thepreceding paragraph for adjective NPs. The NP-final number-marking rule also seems tobe waived for number-marked inanimate referents, if and when these occur at all (so, forexample, mç‡y=d’´h tˆh=po‡g [house=PL 3sg=big] ‘the big house’ is said to begrammatical)—but evidence for this is restricted to consultants’ grammaticalityjudgements, since number marking of inanimates is so rare in actual discourse.","[284, 285]"

13. Tense and related forms
        While aspect indicates the internal temporal consistency of a given situation, tenserelates to the place of the event within the larger context of other events. That is, “tenseis grammaticalised expression of location in time” Comrie (1985: 9). In Hup, aspectplays a much larger role than tense as a formal grammatical category; tense distinctionsare more often simply inferred from the aspectual distinctions and the context, rather thanbeing formally marked (see §12.2 and §17.3.2). This is not uncommon cross-linguistically; some languages, such as Burmese (Comrie 1985: 50), do not have agrammaticalized system of tense at all.","[726, 727]"
"Filler -Vw- occurs in all cases, and only in those cases, in which a headless relative clausestands in for an object or oblique nominal argument of the verb, and is nominalizeddirectly by a case marker (either Oblique -Vêt or Object -a‡n) (see §18.2.3). The casesuffix attaches to the verb stem, separated from it only by the Filler syllable. Thisfunction may have some relationship to the clause-linking role of -Vw- (see above), butthis is unclear. Note that in adverbial clauses, on the other hand, the oblique case-markers -an and -Vêt attach directly to verb stems, with no intervening Filler syllable (see§18.2.6.2). The use of -Vw- in headless case-marked relative clauses is illustrated in (95)(Oblique case), and (96) (Object case). Example (96) also illustrates the commonoccurrence of the Filler syllable between a demonstrative stem and case marker, asmentioned above.(95)    tˆh=hipu‡d [y’Qt-yˆ¤/-ˆw-ˆ¤t]   hˆd kow’ow’-tu/-y’Qt-yˆ¤/-ay-áh

Theseformatives have a number of formal features in common: they are restricted to clause-final position, they can occur only once per clause, and most are free particles or—in afew cases—enclitics. They have scope over the clause as a whole and serve an affect-related function having to do with emphasis or encoding some aspect of social interaction(usually involving the addressee). They tend to be very common in conversation—especially highly animated conversation—but rarely occur in narrative. In general, mostof those that are realized as peripheral formatives never appear in the Inner Suffixposition in the verb. Several have formal variants according to the type of clause(interrogative, imperative, etc.) in which they appear, and in some cases these variants actas ‘internally complex’ Boundary Suffixes (see §3.4.1.2). The details of many of theseformatives’ functions are still unclear, and must await future research.","[852, 853]"
