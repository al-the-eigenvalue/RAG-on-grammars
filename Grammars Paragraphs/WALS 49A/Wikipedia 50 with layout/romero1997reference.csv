Many   existing       analyses     written        at   the    turn    of    the  century        have
described        native     languages       against        a Latin-based           grammatical
background.           Despite        increased           contributions             about         the
functioning         of    native      ianguages        developed          during        the     past

investigated.          In    this    particular            linguistic          context,         some
studies      of    strict    phonological,           morpho-syntactic             and      lexical
scope   have     been    completed.       Nevertheless,            little      attention         has
