                                9.                  Inflection of referential adverbs.                    The small                   class of referential adverbs is inflected for referent by                   means of pronominal prefixes.                     These constructions translate                   into English as prepositional phrases, in which the adverb                   translates as the preposition and the prefix translates as
                   the object of the preposition.                      The pattern of inflection,                   on the whole, is like the inflection of nouns, especially                   restricted noun stems, for possessor, but in one point, as                   indicated in 9.5, it is like the inflection of verbs for
                   object.       Hence the noncommittal term referent is used,                   rather than possessor or object, for the semantic category                   expressed by these prefixes.                     The constitutes of these con­                   structions are adverbs, not nouns, syntactically.                                 That is,                   they may not enter into syntactic expansions of pronominal                   prefixes, but instead modify verbs directly.
                           These referential adverbs are more restricted than nouns
                   in their inflection in that they do not occur without a                   referent: the vowel-initial stems may not take <d-> Nominal.","[454, 455, 456]"
"                          The two Third Person pronouns, aside from the Subjective/                  Objective opposition, have a meaning much like that of the                  demonstratives, but without the latter*s contrasts of person                  or distance.          They are thus used for less specific reference,

"                  Among the significant differences are the facts that only                  the Pirst Person pronoun, after adding a Personal Number

                          The recognition            of the Imperative prefix in this word                  may be semantically farfetched.                      Alternative analyses would                  be the recognition of a homophonous Third Person Objective                  prefix ge- or the recognition of the Third Person Subjective                  prefix g- plus an Objective affix e- or -e, preceding or                  following the pronoun stem i.                     The contrast between the                  Third Person Subjective and Objective pronouns is equivalent
                  to that obtaining between subjective and objective nouns                  (7, 31*1-2 ), and these constitute the only instances in                  the language of stems restricted to use as subject or object.","[459, 460]"

                           Inflection for inclusiveness is accomplished by adding                  one of the two Inclusive suffixes.                         The suffix is chosen to                  agree in number with the pronoun, so that the First Person                  Dual pronoun adds the Dual Inclusive suffix -si and the                  First Person Plural pronoun adds the Plural Inclusive suffix                  -hu.      The constitutes of these two constructions are different                  distribution classes, because of the agreement in number                  with the pronoun of an Inclusive suffix on a noun or verb                  when the pronoun forms a syntactic expansion of the First
                  Person prefix on that noun or verb (8.9.3, 27.11.3).                           a.    First Person Dual Inclusive pronoun.                  le 1 si.si         /lesisi/         'we (du. inc.), us (du. inc.)'

                   <9-> 9- is occasionally found in syntactically unexpanded                   form on restricted noun stems (Nr) to give a citation form                   (where one might expect instead <d-> Nominal).                               Such a form                   also occurs occasionally in texts in cases where the word
                   that is the possessor of the noun has been previously                  mentioned but does not immediately precede this prefix.
                   In this case the prefix might be said to have anaphoric                   reference to this preceding word.","[447, 448]"
"                           The hypothesis of a passive force conferred by this                   prefix has presented itself, but can not be formally
                   substantiated.            As far as can be determined, the subject                   of the derived stems is the person carrying out the action,                   rather than the object(s) receiving the action.                                 This means                   that in the case of transitive verbs the subjects of the
                   underlying and the derived stems would be the same, but in
                   the case of intransitive verbs the subjects would be different,
                   that of the underlying stem being the inanimate object, but
                   that of the derived stem being the person.                             However, the                   evidence on this point is not good, as most of these stems

                           The ITto-Aztekan adjoining washo on the eastern half of                   its border consists of one language, Paviotso or Northern                   Paiute, which is one of six languages in the Numic branch
                   of this family.             The term Sho shone an, also given on the map,
                   refers to a larger grouping which is probably not a valid                   sub-unit of the family.                 Penutian on the west is represented                   by two language families, Maidu and Miwok, in each of which
                   two languages have common borders with Washo.                               The two Maidu
                   languages are Northeastern Maidu or Maidu proper and Southern
                   Maidu or Nisenan; the Miwok languages are Northern Sierra                   Miwok and Central Sierra Miwok.                      There are additional languages
                   in each of these families.                   The degree of relationship between                   Maidu and Miwok is a distant one, whereas the relationship of                   the languages within each of the three surrounding sub-families                   is a more obvious one.
                           The map of Pig. 1 is not intended to show the exact                   boundaries of Washo territory.                     Por a iap showing the probable                   boundaries in relationship to topographical features the
                   reader may be referred to Plate I in Price, 1962.                                 This map,                   which is cased on a synthesis of sources as mdrcated on

                           The name Washo is derived from the native name for the                   tribe and its members, /wa*siw/.                       The English word is usually                   spelled Washo in the anthropological and linguistic literature,                   but it is spelled Washoe in governmental and legal documents

This spelling                    reflects the local pronunciation of the name of the tribe,
                    wherein the second syllable rhymes with shoe.                               This pronunci­
                    ation is a closer approximation to the native form than the                    spelling pronunciation wherein the second syllable rhymes
                    with show.","[20, 21, 22]"
"                    When used as a verb the stem means *to drink                               as a noun
                    it means 'water*.             Since this form apparently does not
                   mean *'to go and drink and return', it is assumed not to

                           23*6*      -ha Causative.            The stem-formative suffix -ha                    Causative has been noted on three nouns, two unrestricted
                    and one restricted, forming transitive verbs.                               The semantic                    relationship of the verb to the noun, differs from case to                    case.        The stem formed from one unrestricted noun conveys                    the idea of making a person (metaphorically) into the noun,
                    the other such stem has the meaning of making the noun for                    a person.         The stem formed from the restricted noun, which                    is not accepted as idiomatic by all speakers, has a meaning                    intermediate between these two, that of adding the noun to
                    the recipient as a permanent part.                            a.     On unrestricted norms,                    g o - z f K 'pig':                            go*zi9 .ha Vt *to make a pig of*, i.e., 'cause to eat

                   suffixes are added to verb stems to derive                             other verb stems

                   transitivity, making intransitive verbs transitive, and transi­                   tive verbs double-transitive.                     With the exception of the                   Causative stiffix in some cases, it is impossible to determine

"                  The alternative to this identification would be the setting                  up of an additional morpheme -e Exhortative.                               Furthermore,                  even granting the analysis of the sequence /se/ into two                 morphemes, there remain possible alternative statements                  about this allomorphy.                 The preferred treatment recognizes                  the fact that in all other environments the Dual Inclusive                 morpheme has the one allomorph -si.                          One would not want to                  say merely that we have here a portmanteau representation
                  of the two morphemes, because of the identity of the first
                  consonant of the Dual Inclusive suffix                                of the sequence                 /se/; a more tenable statement would be that this is a case
                  of including and included morphs, where the /§/ belongs                  only to the Dual Inclusive suffix, but the /e/ belongs to                 both morphemes.              Or, one might conclude that the Dual

                  in the use that is made of the available e-coloring morpho-                  phonema as the representation of the Op-canive suffix in                  this environment is that there is no clear evidence that it                  colors a preceding vowel in the same manner as a following
                  one; trying to overcome this drawback by maintaining that                  the morph is infixed in the Dual Inclusive suffix (Qs e iQ)
                  would introduce a greater anomaly in the language structure.
                          It is not possible to say that /§e/ is merely an alio—                  morph of the Dual Inclusive suffix <-si>, since the two                  morpheme sequences may contrast minimally after stems that
                  are both nouns and verbs, e.g., /laqalsi/ 1our (du. inc.)
                  house* vs. /laqalse/ *let*s build a house*.

                  always occurs followed by <-i> Imperfect presents itself.

"                 In this transcription spaces are left between the successive                 morphs.        Finally, the phonemic representation for the se­                 quence of morphophonemes is given, enclosed in slashes /.../.
                         Both a zero morphophoneme Q$B and a zero phoneme /0/                 are assumed to be present on their respective levels between
                 every pair of successive units.                       These may correspond to non­                 zero units in either direction.                       Thus B$0            be represented

                 Conversely, /$/ may be the phonemic representation of a con­                 sonant, as in 3.6, or of a vowel, as in 3.15; this latter                 case is sometimes called ""loss"".                       A zero is usually written
                 on the morphophonemic level only when it is the complete
                 representation of a morpheme; the recurrent case in what                 follows is the allomorph 0,0— B of the Third Person prefix
                 <’-> .     Either kind of zero may also be written in the formula                 for a morphophonemic rule.",[274]

                   fix appears to be quite limited and semantically coherent,
                   one might alternatively say that these nouns are also members                   of the class of defective intransitive verbs that occur only                   with this prefix, rather than treating this as an instance                   of denominative derivation.                    The nouns occurring with this
                   prefix fall into two semantic spheres: they either express                   tangible or visible natural phenomena or they are names of
                   seasons.          The derived verbs in the former case express the                   occurrence of the natural phenomena.                          In the latter case they
                   express the current occurrence of the season in question;                   they also seemingly express the notion of passing a season
                   in a given place, although this is attested only for 'winter*
                   and *summer*.","[569, 570, 571]"

                             9.5.               Expressed referent.                To express with an inde­                   pendent noun or pronoun the referent of a referential adverb,                   the Third Person prefix <9-> 9- ~ 0- expanded with this noun
                   or pronoun is used.               This construction is used even with a                   First or Second Person pronoun, which makes the inflection                   of referential adverbs different in this respect from the                   inflection of nouns and similar to the inflection of verbs                   for objects.           However, with respect to the inflection for                   first or second person referent by prefix alone, the inflec­                   tion of these adverbs is similar to that of nouns and of                   verbs for subjects.

Pronoun inflection.               Pronouns are formed by                  inflection of the pronoun stem i.                         Pour different persons                  are formed by means of four inflectional prefixes.                                      Any of
                   these pronouns may be inflected for dual or plural number                  by the addition of a Personal Number suffix.                                The Pirst                  Person pronoun in the dual or plural number may be further                   inflected for inclusiveness by the addition of an Inclusive                   suffix.        When not followed by a suffix, the pronoun stem is                  phonemically long by a regular morphophonemic rule (3.17.2).","[456, 457, 458, 459]"
"                  For example, a form such as                  00    tu9m te iti’ i 0          /tum’teti^i/            'he has both feet hanging                       down 5

                  would have to decide whether to reinterpret /m?™/ as Anin/ qt>                  as /mm/,        Either way we would not avoid morphophonemie changes.
                  Choosing the former alternative would avoid changes in forms                  parallel to the one we have just seen, such as

                   0j3 turn m e ime we*7 iO           /tummemewe9!/.
                   The other alternative would give us an interesting morphopho-                   nemic change whereby the glottalization would pass from the                   first to the second resonant:
                   Q0 turn me Ime we9 iQ               /tummemewe9i/.
                   But the choice of the former alternative would introduce                   changes in other forms, such as
                   8 9um 9 ma*sQ        / 9 um 9 ma*s/      'your pine nut territory',                   which would become                   0 9um ma*s 0       / 9 umma*s/.
                   In this latter case a morphophonemie change is avoided by                   the preferred analysis, as well as by the other alternative,                   which would give us / 9 umma*s/.","[95, 96]"
"                  In this case the derived form has the same semantic relation­                  ship to the underlying verb as it does without this inter­                  vening layer of derivation.                    When this suffix is added to                  an underived noun, the derived fora describes the physical                  result of an action, such as 'gathering', applied to the                  noun.      For this suffix added to verbs, see 14.14.

                               14,     Derivation of nouns from verb stems.                         Nouns are                   derived from verb stems both by means of prefixes (14.1-14.11)                   and suffixes (14.12-14.15).
                           14.1.               Prefixes deriving nouns from verbs.                       The produc­                   tive prefixes that derive nouns from verbs are <d-> Nominal,                   <t-> Third Person Nominal, and <9it-> Attributive-Instru­                   mental.        The remaining prefixes (14.5-14.11) are highly
                   restricted in their application.","[502, 503]"
"                          In order to avoid excessive repetition, the term third                  person nominal has been introduced in this section*                                    This
                  means a noun, demonstrative, quantitative, third person pro­                  noun, or nominalized clause.
                          There are two restrictions that run throughout these
                  constructions and have not been repeated in the separate                  sections.         The first concerns the opposition between subjec­                  tive and objective third person pronouns (10.1) and between                  subjective and objective nominalized clauses (31.1-2).                                    Only                  the subjective members of these pairs may be used in construc­                  tions forming subjects of verbs or possessors of nouns, and                  only the objective members may be used in constructions form­                  ing direct or indirect objects of verbs.                            The second restric­                  tion is that a nominalized clause may only be the first in                  linear order of a series of words expanding a prefix.",[418]
"                           Insofar as one can judge from the relatively small                  number of stems involved, it appears to be the case that                   intransitive verb stems beginning with a vowel do not take                   the Collective Plural prefix directly, but first add the                  reduplicative Plural prefix.                      In such cases the latter                  prefix does not seem to add anything to the meaning of the                  whole, but merely to be added for purely formal reasons.",[552]

                              14.14.              -ewe? Resultative.             The Resultative suffix -ewe’                   is added to intransitive verb stems to derive unrestricted                  noun stems expressing the physical entity resulting from the                  action described by the verb.                         Apparently this suffix cannot                  be added to transitive verb stems, as many of the underlying                   intransitive stems are derived from transitive verb stems,                  by <’um-> Intransitivizing or be- Indefinite Object, as well                   as from neutral verb stems by m- Intransitive.

                                 15.               Verb themes as nouns.                 A common pattern of                    formation of names of places and persons is the use of a                    verb theme formed with <‘?-> 9----0- Third Person expanded
                    with a noun expressing the subject.                         A few personal names                    also occur in which the prefix is expanded for object (sec­                    tion c).           There are likewise several personal names in which                    the prefix is not expanded for either subject or object (sec­                    tion d); for the majority of these, in which the prefix has                    the zero allomorph, it is merely a hypothesis based on the                    analogy of the other names that these are instances of themes,                    rather than stems, used as nouns.
                            One place name has been noted in variant forms (not                    necessarily applying to the same place), one in this pattern                    and one with the verb nominalized by de- Nominal; this means                    literally ""rocks in a row"" or ""ridge"".

The thematic suffix -ugil                   Defunetive indicates an interruption or cessation of the                   action or condition expressed by the theme to which it is
                   affixed.        At times it conveys the simple meaning of empha­
                   sizing that the described situation is no longer true, e.g.,                    •it was raining (but it has stopped)', 'it was on his head
                   (but it has been removed)',                   'his eyes were closed (but now
                   they are open)*.             At other times (especially in the texts                   from HP), this suffix emphasizes that the action described
                   was one characteristic of people now dead and gone, and
                   hence one no longer practised.                      This suffix also commonly
                   expresses a semantic linkage with the following verb, in                   eases where the action or condition expressed by the latter                   is not the normally expected sequel of the one expressed
                   by the verb to which -ugil is affixed —                            cases where the
                   first action is interrupted, thwarted, nullified, rejected,                   or counteracted by the second action.","[624, 625]"

                 which occurs at the end of several instrumental prefixes, has
                 a lengthening effect upon immediately following stressed vowels,                 and it also colors following QiQ to /e/ in the same manner as                 0e{j.       The lengthening may he inhibited by certain patterns of
                 consonants following the vowel, the rules for which have not
                 been fully worked out.                It seems likely, however, that the                 inhibiting environment consists of either a consonant cluster                 or a glottal morphophoneme 09 h[3 *                     When the vowel is in such
                 an environment, the (PO has no effect upon an OaQ» while it
                 colors an QiQ to /e/ without lengthening it; examples of these
                 cases are given in sections c and d.                         If the following vowel                 is already long, its length is not affected; here again the
                 only perceptible effect of this morphophoneme is the coloring                 of Bi*Q bo /e*/*             See sections e and f for examples of this

                 ing as to whether this morphophoneme lengthens a following

The entries are of two kinds,
                   main entries and cross references.                         Each morpheme has one
                   main entry.           If the morpheme has more than one allomorph or
                    dialectal variant, this entry begins with a heading sur­
                   rounded by < >, followed by a listing of the allomorphs,                   separated by              and the dialectal variants, separated by                   commas.        If the morpheme has only one allomorph and dialec­                   tal variant, the entry has this for a heading, without                   surrounding brackets.                 After this heading may come a symbol                   for the distribution class, in the case of members of large                   classes, and then a meaning or label for the morpheme.                                The                   references are to sections of the grammar or pages of the                   Introduction.            The cross references have as their heading
                   an allomorph or dialectal variant other than that chosen as
                   the heading for the morpheme.                      This is followed, after a                   colon, by the heading for the main entry for the morpheme.","[687, 688, 689]"

"                           The second variation would be to say that the syllable-                   final stops were the plain stops, rather than clusters with                   /h/ in either order.                This is equivalent to equating the                   syllable-final stops with the voiced stops, and is subject                   to the morphophonemie advantages and disadvantages that                   have been discussed in section 1.7.6.                          Then QpCQ and QpCQ                   would be represented by /pC/.                     The word for *bottle* would                  have the one phonemic allomorph /kehtep/, so that the forms                   shown in the preceding paragraph would become /kehtep/                   •bottle', /kehteplu/ 'with a bottle*, and /kehtepa/ 'in a                   bottle*.        The word for ’body* would have phonemic allomorphs                   showing an alternation between /hp/ and /p/, as in /tahpis/                   'his body* and /tapsa/ 1on his body*.                          This analysis would                  be much less divergent phcnctactically in that it would                   introduce three-consonant clusters with medial /h/ only                   in the rather infrequent case where the voiceless stop                  was the final member, and it would eliminate the four—con­                   sonant clusters.

His evidence consisted                    of seven lexical juxtapositions and a noting of the similarity                    between the nominal d- prefixes of these languages.                                  This
                    lead was picked up by Sapir in his 1925 article, even though
                    he was compelled to demonstrate that four of the lexical                    comparisons were untenable.                    Sapir of course pointed out                    that any relationship to Washo would have to be interpreted                    as a relationship to Hokan and Goahuiltecan.                              His attempt                    at confirming such a relationship presents 136 sets of                    lexical comparisons and includes a discussion of apparent
                    Subtiaba sound changes and a comparative treatment of aspects
                    of Subtiaba and Hokan morphology, especially derivational                    prefixes.        Most of the Washo lexical material used in this                    paper had already been used for comparisons in the 1919

"                          4.32.       Shortening of vowels.                Five verb stems which                  have long initial vowels in most environments have allo­                  morphs with those vowels shortened when taking affixes which                  are partly infixed after these vowels.                           The first stem shown
                  below has this allomorph in the presence of ^i^g6-. .-1- Pi                   '(pi.) to run'; the other four stems show their shortened                  allomorphs in the presence of <‘?um-> e-. ,-m- Intransitivizing                  (22.5).        In the case of the three stems wherein the stressed
                  vowel is followed by a voiced stop, we could say that this                  vowel is short on the morphophonemic level and is lengthened                  by a regular morphophonemic rule (3.17) when the infix (a                  voiced resonant) does not intervene between the vowel and the                  stop.      This would not work, however, in the case of the two                  stems wherein the vowel is followed by a glcttalized stop,                  as there is no parallel morphophonemic rule applying to such
                  an environment.             There are, in faet, two other stems which                  take the Intransitivizing affix <9im-> e-.e-m- and which                  show a short vowel both with and without the infix, namely
                  ipel Vt 'to dig a hole' and Iteg Vt 'to gut *.                              One can not                  say that the shortening is due to the presence of the short-                  ener morphophoneme             Q Q, as the affixes in question already

There are two verb stems                 that have allomorphs containing posttonic QiQ in the presence                 of infixes.           These allomorphs avoid potential three-consonant                 clusters and also avoid the insertion of /i/ in a different                 position by a morphophonemic rule (3.13).                      4.33.1.             <apd> 'to peel, shell'.

It is necessary to recognize                 the allomorph apid because, while the morphophonemic rule                 for the insertion of /i/ (3.13) would produce the correct                 preconsonantal allomorph /ampit/, it would produce an in­                 correct prevocalic allomorph */amipd/ from the morphopho­                 nemic form *Qe a[m]pdf).

                   latter type of prefixes is more like itsobject.                                 Most of                   the prefixes in -u seem to imply motion, which does not                   seem to be the            case with those in -e .","[525, 526]"

"                           When the Intermediate Future suffix is followed by the

                    the Imperfect suffix follows; in particular it is not clear                    that it would not sometimes refer to the immediate future,                    as analogous expressions containing the Near Future suffix                   followed by the Aorist suffix are rather rare, although
                    they do occur.            If another verb follows such a phrase, to                   convey the notion that the action actually will occur or is                   occurring, this verb is in the near future tense or in the
                   imperfect.","[658, 659]"
"                           This suffix is usually followed by -i Imperfect, with                   no restriction on further nominalization or adverbialization                   of the predication.               Very characteristic are phrases in                   which such forms, usually nominalized, take an adverbializing                   suffix -duk or -dug 'as, like, and so', and are followed by                   a form of a verb with generalized meaning, usually wa’ 'to                   do', e9 'to be', or id 'to say', to indicate that the action
                   in question is in keeping with custom or tradition.                                   Many of                   the examples given below show tnxs, such as the first example                   of section a, which is there translated rather freely as                   'h e 's eating as usual *, but might be translated more liter­
                   ally a a ’he usually eats and so he's doing*.                              The Usitative                   suffix is also followed by -i9 Attributive-Agentive, which
                   is followed in turn usually by -a9 Aorist but also by -i                   Imperfect (with nominalization and -duk) and by -a9yi9

                     occurring suffix —emel9 Traditional seems to indicate that
                     the action expressed by the verb to which it is suffixed is                     one that is or was done in accordance with traditional usage,                     or, in the case of animals, in accordance with the natural
                    habits of the species.                  Its meaning is often difficult to                     distinguish from that of -enun Usitative.                            This suffix is                     thought to occur always with following -i Imperfect, with                     subjective or objective nominalization (31.1-2).                                However,                     the -i is never apparent phonemically, being lost because                     of the preceding B^B*                If this hypothesis about the presence
                    of -i Imperfect is incorrect, this would make -erneI9 a final,                    rather than a prefinal, suffix.                       The frequency of usage of
                    this suffix seems to vary considerably with informants,                    0 mus       x*gew i9 emel9 i ** g i:                /tanu muse *gewi9 emel9 gi/                        ‘people used to tell the story*                    ge dx[*]ye * emel9 i "" g i:                    /ka*ka9 gedx9ye9emel9gi/                 'they

                     Visual indicates that the speaker's knowledge concerning                     the situation described by the verb comes from direct                     observation, usually in the absence of other sources of                     information.          Verbs bearing this suffix may be literally                     ti^aiated into English by making the suffix into a primary                    verb.       Thus when the underlying verb means 'you have come',                    the form with this suffix might be translated 'I see (that)                    you have come' or 'you have come, I see*.                    m xye^.iye’ i           /mlye^iye’i/            'you have come, I see' (a common                        greeting)

                    verb stems, both primary and derived, and after two derived                    transitive verb stems, on one of which it follows the                    stem-formative suffixes -uwe9 'hence* and -u§ Durative.
                    There are also examples of this suffix on the Anaphoric
                    Theme <9 .. '>.         Although conclusive evidence is lacking, it                    seems probable that this is a thematic suffix, rather than                    a stem-formative suffix.
                            The Auditive suffix is usually followed by -i Imperfect,                   which may in turn be followed by the Reference Switching                    suffix -s and/or Nominalizing suffixes.                           This suffix also                    occurs before -le Redundant and before <-a9> -a Aorist

There are three different situa­                 tions in which a morphophonemic choice between /a/ and /e/                 according to patterns of vowel harmony is made in a syllable                preceding the stressed syllable of the word, and the rules                 for the choice are the same in each case.                            The situations                 arise in the preconsonantal representation of fleQ (3.9.1),
                 the preconsonantal representation of Q^B (3.9.2), and the in­                 sertion of a vowel after QwB (3.14).                         This choice of vowel
                quality is conditioned by the quality of a certain following                vowel.       All speakers agree as to the correlation between the
                 quality of this vowel and the choice of /a/ or /e/, but there                 is a dialectal difference regarding the placement of the con­
                ditioning vowel.              In the southernmost dialect, represented                by KJ, the conditioning vowel is the next following one, re­                gardless of whether or not it is stressed.                              In the remainder                 of the area the conditioning vowel is the next stressed vowel,                regardless of whether or not there are intervening unstressed
                vowels.","[317, 318]"
