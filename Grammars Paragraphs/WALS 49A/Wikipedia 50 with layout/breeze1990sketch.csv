      When the head of the noun phrase is a noun, nominative and accusativesuffixes are obligatory when the noun is specific and optional when the
                                                  41noun is not specific.     When the head of the phrase is a pronoun, however,the subject almost always bears the nominative suffix, whereas the objectonly bears the accusative suffix when it is especially prominent in thesentence.   The genitive suffix is optional whether the head is a noun or apronoun.    In all the other cases the suffix is obligatory.                          Regardingpronouns, apart from the nominative, it is the basic form of the pronounto which the case markers are affixed.                  Some examples are:

§3.1. THE NOUN PHRASE:
§3.1.1. NOUN PHRASE STRUCTURE:       The normal structure of the noun phrase can be represented by thefollowing formula:       NP = (Modifier1) Head (Modifier 2)                  (Determiner)          (Case)   (Quantifier)       Modifier        can be a possessive pronoun, a numeral, an adjective or a
                  1
relative clause.            The head is usually a noun or a pronoun but it may alsobe an adjective or a determiner.                Modifier           can be a numeral, an adjective
                                                           2
or a relative clause.             When the head is a pronoun, the only optionalelement to occur is the case marker.

"This marker, however, does not occur in a phrase where the head is a non-specific noun, neither is it added to a relative clause which precedes thehead it modifies.    In fast speech, it may be elided before the determiner.

FOCUS WITHIN THE NOUN PHRASE:      When a previously referred to head of a noun phrase has specialprominence in the sentence, an appropriate form of the pronoun may occurfollowing the determiner, or, in some cases, instead of it.              This seems to

act as a suffix rather than as a separate word, because the marker _anever precedes it and the initial consonant of the pronoun is often elided.",[42]
"      The most frequent use of this construction is in a noun phrasefunctioning as subject, where the third person masculine or feminine

         Less frequently, the oblique case pronoun may be added to an objector to a noun bearing a possessive suffix, e.g.                  a 4 sln

"Where the head of the first phrase of a co-ordinate noun phrase is in anaccompanying role to the second, the co-ordinate marker replaces the casemarker on each, but the verb following will be governed by the subject of thesecond phrase only.        In this case, at least one of the phrases, usually thesecond,is a pronoun.

§l.    PHONOLOGY:§l.l. VOWELS:       There are five vocalic phonemes in Gimira:                                  i                                 u                                  e                                     o

       Generally, vowels are short, but a sequence of two similar vowelsoccurring as a result of affixation is realised as a phonetic long vowel.

§l.2. CONSONANTS:       The following chart shows the consonantal phonemes of Gimira:Table 1  p    pY pW t t Y                s([ts])        c([f}])            G- k k Y                    ? ?Y ?w  b    bY b W d d Y                                                         g    gY g W  p'            t't Y'            s'([ts']) c'([tl']) ct' k' k Y'

                I   r                            Y
       These phonemes have allophones as follows:(a)/p/ has two allophones: [ph] and Ir l .                       Either [ph]           or   lr l       occur inany position; no conditioning has been noted, e.g.                    [ ap
                           hI ] or [af I ] eye(b)/y/ has two allophones: [y] and             [w]2. [w] occurs before back vowels,
                                                       -6-
while [y] 9ccurs before front and central vowels e.g.

consonant cluster following                  In/.     Before         I al either [3] or [3 j ] may
occur.        Elsewhere [3] only occurs, e.g.                    [gond3 4]              cooked ms!lt              [ka3 2-3]     happiness                    [ gen 4   d3 u 4 b a y l ] dikdik                [ma34gas3]    be patient

[tl j , ] .     Before tal either the palatalised form or the non-palatalisedform may occur.        Elsewhere [I] and [D'] only occur, e s g ,                    [ lap' 3 ] or [I J·ap , 3 J coo k1.:ng-po t

       /n/ has two allophones:               [ n J and [ I)] •         [I)] occurs preceding velars,
[n] occurs elsewhere, e.g.

The contrast between /n/ and                      [m] is neutralised postconsonantally,          forhere we find a syllabic nasal (represented phonologically as N) which alwayshas the same place of articulation as the preceding consonant, e.g.

However,tone is important in distinguishing the cases of certain pronouns, certainverb tenses, the morphological classes of certain words and the semanticfeatures of certain adjectives.","[7, 8]"
"      A number of descriptive adjectives can be intensified by raisingthe tone to tone 5, e.g.

"§3.3. THE VERB PHRASE:      The verb phrase structure can be shown by the following fomula:      VP = (S.Pn) (O.Pn) V (S.Pn) (Aux V)V can be a main verb, a subordinate verb or a participle.                      S.Pn is the reducedform of the subject pronoun which has been included in the verb phrase fortwo reasons; firstly because it can occur in addition to a normal subjectpronoun and secondly because in a phrase containing an auxiliary verb, it canoccur either before the main verb or between the main verb and the auxiliaryverb, e.g.
                            I     3             3        4       3   323

~.4.l.   CLAUSE STRUCTURE:      Basic clause structure is:                   NPs           Complement VPNP s and complement are optional.

"      There are three forms of subject pronoun:      The normal subject form functions as head of a noun phrase and generallyencodes known information and refers to a subject pervious1y mentioned, e.g.
                     3 3 3 4 4 .43 2 3

      The emphatic subject form changes to tone 1 and is used when thesubject has special prominence in the sentence.                  It usually occurs sentence-initially, being front-shifted to precede the adverbial phrase when one ispresent, e.g.                yi lSi 3       u2~am4      ke 4tn 5        karlti 5     han 3k 'u 2e 3

                Then he returned home
      A reduced subject form functions as part of the verb phrase and servesto indicate the person and number of the subject of the verb it precedes,where this cannot be distinguished by the verb form alone.                     It retains tone3 but final C is dropped.             One of the other subject pronoun forms may alsooccur in its normal position, e.g.

§2.8.4. SIMPLE TENSES:       The simple indicative verb has the following structure:          v = V root (Tense) (Neg) (Foc.Pn) Person/number Mk (Fin V Mk)
       There are three simple tenses:The simple past tense:               In the affirmative this is formed from the paststem, e. g.
                    3
              ham               go           han 3 23

            4 3         2 3                                   3
       ham m su e              He will go          cf , ham        go       When the future marker is added to the basic form of Class 2 verbs,the syllabic        _N 3       is elided and the tone of the marker is raised to tone4, e.g.
                3 3                       3 423             .

                    +      +4
                    ¢J    -ns       The present perfect tense is formed from the present participle stem,e.g.              ye a-
                  San 4 k'en 2 de 3              They have prepared

                          23e                    He has gone       For verbs whose future and past stms are identical, the only differencebetween the future and one of the present perfect forms is the tone on -Ns-,
                                                  -30-e.g.
               33323                              will love
          ta    ~un ~u e                      I
                           3 4   2 3          I   have loved
          ta ~un ~u e
                                                                                             4
       For the negative, the future stem is used and the negative marker -arg -is affixed before the pronoun or person/number marker.                 The present perfecthas no distinct negative form.
            4     423                          He did not go
          ha m~u e
              4 3  423                         He will not go
          ham m s~u e
       When the negative marker is added to the basic form of class 2 verbs,the nasal becomes part of the following tone 4 syllable, e.g.
               3             423               He was not helped
          ga~ ~ u              e
       When the focus of a clause is on the verb rather than on the subject,the emphatic form of the subject pronoun is affixed before the person/number marker instead of an independent pronoun form occurring immediatelyprior to the verb.               -g    of preceding negative marker is dropped except
                2
before yint                you (polite/plural).     In this case, it is the -y that isdropped e.g.          hank' 3 t a Inu 2e 3                I   went
             4 3   4 123

CONCLUSIONS:
     In this paper, I have attempted to present a preliminary analysis ofthe main features of the phonology and grammar of the Gimira language.                            Asthe analysis has been based on data collected from a limited number ofspeakers living outside their home area, the conclusions reached aretentative.       However, it is hoped that there will be opportunities in thefuture for more detailed research to be carried out.

After affixation, up to five extra syllables may be addedto a verb root and up to four may be added to a noun root.                No more thantwo of the added syllables contain a syllabic nasal, but a syllabic nasalcan occur in any suffix syllable, e.g.
