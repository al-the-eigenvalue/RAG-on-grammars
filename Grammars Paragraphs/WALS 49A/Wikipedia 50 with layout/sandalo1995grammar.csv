One possible answer            that can be found within Government & Binding theory is that case licenses the presence of grammatical            arguments. Thus, the function of those morphemes could be assignment of structural case. But Kadiwéu            presents evidence against this interpretation.     A morpheme such as -d: can occur with a subject pronoun            (nominative) in unaccusative clauses (310) or object pronoun (accusative) in transitive clauses (311). All            subjects (i.e. subjects of transitive clauses (which only appear if the object is third-person). unergative            subjects, unaccusative subjects. and subjects of passives and reflexives) are in the nominative case in            Kadiwéu. Objects are marked by a different set of pronominals.            If we were dealing with case, I would            expect pronominals co-occurring with -d: to belong to a same structural class (i.e. nominative. accusative.            or ergative). This is not the case —        there is one form that indicates      that the pronominal   is in the            nominative case and another that indicates accusative case and -d: co-occurs with both. The morpheme -            d: indicates the semantic role of a pronominal. theme. not its case. This fact indicates to me that the            transitivity morphemes         are operating on theta   role assignment     --   hence   the label semantic   role            morphemes.

"              4.2.1. Kadiwéu Semantic Role Markers.              Many languages that have a free constituent order also have       morphologically marked case. In such languages case markers are like English prepositions in that they assign       semantic roles. Thus. several authors prefer to label these elements as semantic role markers or semantic case       markers (e.g. Simpson 1983).       Kadiwéu fits this pattern. except that it is the pronominal clitics and affixes. rather       than nouns, that co-occur with semantic case morphology.         Kadiwéu has six semantic role markers: -d: ‘theme’. -gi       ‘goal’, -wa ~ -ma ‘dative’, -dom ~ -ma ~ -lo 'benefactive', -k 'allative', and lokom 'adessive'. Subject markers must be       followed by either © (agent subjects) or -d: 'theme'. Direct object markers must be followed by -d: ‘theme’. Indirect       object enclitics must be followed by one of the following morphemes: -wa ~ -ma ‘dative’, -dom ~ -ma ‘benefactive’. -       k ‘allative'. -g ‘goal’, /okom ‘adessive'.'*

                   In order to license grammatical internal arguments (i.e. transitive. ditransitive. and unaccusative           clauses), we must add role suffixes. Example 308 and 309 show that a stem functions as a noun or a           transitive verb depending on whether the semantic role markers are present or not.       In 308 they are not           present and the stems function as a noun: that is, syntactic arguments cannot be added in spite of the fact           that the valency suffix -Gen: '[+become]' is present and in spite of the fact that a Kadiwéu speaker           understands that somebody is pierced. In 309, however. the semantic role -d: ‘theme’ is present and the           stems functions as a transitive clause; that is. there is a grammatical internal argument, Go-'Ipl.OBJ':           (308)       lapwaGen:ig:i.

The function of these morphemes,         however, is actually more complex. They license the          grammatical internal arguments.","[128, 129]"
"               Since second person is higher than first person. a transitive verb whose subject is second person and whose        object is Isg can also be marked by a subject prefix rather than an object prefix. In this case, the subject marker        must be followed by the semantic case marker -d: 'theme’.        (94)     ad:ad:e:gi.

"                  What transitivity means in terms of generative grammar is controversial. Jelinek (1994.             1995)           interprets transitivity as the ability to assign theta-roles. Baker (1991, 1994) takes a different perspective:          according to Baker. verbs in pronominal argument languages have no case to assign to complements.",[119]

"              Griffiths   1987 and Griffiths      1991   are descriptions of Kadiwéu   relative clauses and wuinterrogatives.        respectively, including a discussion of constituent order and constituent movement. The author points out that the        constituent order of Kadiwéu main clauses varies freely between VSO and SVO, while the constituent order of        subordinate clauses is always VSO. My data shows that the constituent order of Kadiwéu main clauses is much        freer than Griffiths reports. Possible orders are OVS, VOS, SOV. OSV, VSO, and SVO. The high frequency of        SVO order in Griffiths’ publications seems to be biased by elicitation technique: I have found that Kadiwéu        speakers tend to translate Portuguese sentences with SVO order. The problem is that, although one can translate        Portuguese sentences word-by-word         into Kadiwéu,    the resulting set of Kadiwéu     sentences      reflects a small        proportion of the constituent order of Kadiwéu,         which has much     freer order. Griffiths never mentions that        (semantic) case is morphologically marked in Kadiwéu, and free constituent order is not unusual among languages        which mark case morphologically.",[16]
"               A severe ban on degenerate feet makes predictions about possible word shapes. If a quantity-insensitive       language allow no degenerate feet at all. then there can be no monosyllables in this language.            Therefore.       monosyllables are predicted to be non-existent in Noble Kadiwéu, which is quantity-insensitive. This is indeed the       case: monosyllabic words must be expanded into disyllables, as represented in 42.       (42)                    a
              Observe in 42 that the vowel is not merely lengthened: instead it is reduplicated into a new syllable. The       syllabic trochee languages which ban degenerate feet studied by Hayes allow no words consisting of a single light       syllable; however,   they do allow monosyllabic words consisting of a heavy syllable. Hayes thus proposes that       syllabic-trochee languages characteristically employ a minimal-word constraint which takes heavy syllables as       proper feet. Kadiwéu conterexemplifies Hayes’ generalization, since all stems containing an odd number of       syllables, even those which contain a long vowel, must be expanded in order to be well-formed. The wave forms in       Figure 2 illustrates the analysis with the monosyllables ve: ‘he died' and ye 'my belly’. which show the same       reduplication pattern. Each peak in the wave represents one independent vowel. Long vowels appear as long peaks.",[42]
"        4.2. Kadiwéu as a Pronominal Argument Language
             Jelinek 1984 explains the properties of nonconfigurational languages by proposing that languages set the       elements which can work as verbal arguments.                  According to Jelinek. pronominal clitics and affixes are the       arguments in nonconfigurational languages; nominal phrases are adjuncts, and therefore they can assume free       order or be omitted. This proposal has not been universally accepted. however. The existence of inflectional       morphemes      functioning   as arguments       challenges     the   idea of a fixed phrase      structure   over   which   syntactic       relationships such as subject and object can be defined.                 An altemative analysis would          be to say that the       morphemes on the verb do not replace conventional argument phrases, but that nonconfigurational languages are       nothing more than cases of obligatory pro-drop languages. Baker 1984, for instance, argues that nominal phrases       are adjuncts in Mohawk, but he denies that Mohawk pronominals are arguments. According to Baker. the verbal       arguments are an empty category pro that occupies the projections of the verb. Kadiwéu offers evidence supporting       Jelinek's hypothesis that inflectional morphemes can indeed be arguments in some languages. Arguments are       understood in this work as elements that (i) are in A-position (adjuncts are in A-bar position), (ii) are subject to the       Theta-criterion, and (iii) are subject to special kinds of syntactic operations (i.e. passivization, which affects       arguments but not adjuncts).",[87]
"             This proposal. however, relies on the assumption that theta-roles are assigned to noun phrases. But we          saw in § 4.2 above that there is good reason to believe that pronominals, rather than nominal phrases. are          verbal arguments in Kadiwéu; that is, theta-roles are assigned verb-internally. This entails that an element

           cannot receive theta-roles from two independent verbs in Kadiwéu. Further fieldwork will be necessary to           test whether pronominals can also be considered arguments in SVCs. In any case. the patterns of SVCs           probably still need to be sorted out in theoretical linguistics.","[116, 117]"
"               If lexical categories do not project in pronominal argument languages. what is the clausal structures of           these languages? Chomsky    1995 proposes that functional heads vary across languages in that they calty           strong features in some languages and weak features in others. Since strong features must be discharged.           functional categories carrying strong features trigger movement. Thus. according to this proposal. English           differs from languages without (overt) wH-movement         in that complementizers   carry strong features in           English, and therefore they trigger movement. Chomsky 1995 proposes that transitivizing morphemes are           functional categories that function as light verbs. Jelinek 1995 assumes this analysis and proposes that           transitivizing morphemes are functional heads that carry strong features in some languages, triggering           verb movement. I adopt this proposal and assume that the Kadiwéu semantic role markers, represented in           319 as 8, are functional categories which must discharge their strong features and therefore trigger           movement:

               On this hypothesis. the Kadiwéu semantic role suffixes are like light verbs. Grimshaw & Mester (1988)           argue that light verbs are functional categories that must be in a symbiotic                      relationship with lexical           categories that are valent but unable to assign theta-roles to complements. Whereas the verb is valent but           unable to assign theta-roles. a light verb is avalent but able to assign theta-roles: that is. able to license           grammatical arguments. Working on the Minimalism framework. I propose that a valent stem is attracted           to adjoin 9, the light verb. As a result theta-assigning takes place. This proposal explains why D nodes           function as arguments. Theta-roles are discharged at the SPEC position of © to D nodes: there is no other           nominal element in the structure. Note in 319 that the order of the Kadiwéu morphemes is captured by           this proposal.””              4.4.4. Summary             and Implications.            In this section I proposed that lexical categories are divided in           the Kadiwéu lexicon into valent and avalent roots. and I believe that this provides enough evidence to          classify them as either verbs or nouns. Although Kadiwéu has valent roots. it has no transitive roots.","[135, 136]"

             A single pronominal affix or clitic co-occurs with several different semantic case markers. Conversely. a       particular semantic case marker can co-occur with more than one pronominal prefix or enclitic.

           spokenby about 1,500 Indians distributed over
                                                      an area of 538,000 hectares in the State of Mato Grosso do
           Sul, Brazil. The Kadiwéus are the only surviving descendants of the Mbayd people, who
                                                                                               in the 18th.
           century dominated a large extension of the Brazilian and Paraguayan Chaco area. The data for this study
           is comprised primarily of material collected in fieldwork with native speakers of Kadiwéu in Serra da
           Bodoquena, Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil.
               I provide a detailed description of Kadiwéu phonology and morphology. | offer a description of the
           Kadiwéu phonology, on synchronic and diachronic grounds, taking dialect differences into consideration.
           Kadiwéu      has two dialects which reflect gender and social status. Moreover,                 I provide a detailed
           description of the verb and noun morphology. The verb is marked for subject and object in person and
           number.     Kadiwéu    marks subject person with          prefixes, but number (pl)      is marked     with a suffix
           immediately following
                            the root. Aspect
                                         and mood, but not tense, are markedon the verb. There are seven
           aspect markers - completive/incompletive/durative, telic/atelic, repetitive, and intensive - and two mood
           markers, conditional and desiderative.          There are also three negation markers and a set of directional
           enclitics. Among      the WaikurGan languages, only Kadiwéu has a set of semantic role markers. The
           structure of the Kadiwéu noun resembles noun structure in other Waikunian languages as well as in most
           westem      South   American   languages.       The   presence   of classifiers/nominalizers    marking   inalienable
           possession seems to be an areal feature of the languages of western lowland South America.
               Several aspects of the Kadiwés syntax, which bear on theoretical issues, are discussed. Kadiwéu has
           the classical properties of a nonconfigurational language: any nominal phrase can be omitted, nominal
           phrases are freely ordered with respect to each other and the verb,              and some discontinuous nominal
           expressions
                 are allowed.             Jelinek   1984    explains the properties of nonconfigurational
                                                                                                  languages by
          proposing that languages set the elements which can be verbal arguments.                        According to Jelinek,
           pronominal clitics and affixes are the arguments in nonconfigurational languages;
                                                                                      nominal phrases are
           adjuncts and therefore they can assume free order or be omitted. This proposal has not been universally
           accepted, however. For instance, Baker 1994 argues that nominat phrases are adjuncts in Mohawk, but he
           denies that pronominals are arguments in this language. According to Baker, the arguments are an empty
           category pro that occupies the projections of the verb. Kadiwéu offers evidence supporting Jelinek’'s

            hypothesis that pronominals can indeed be arguments in some languages. First, pronominal clitics and
            affixes co-occur with elements which are roughly tike English prepositions in that they assign semantic
            roles: -d: 'theme', -wa ~ -ma ‘dative’, -dom ~ -ma ‘benefactive’, -g ‘goal’, -/okom '‘adessive', -k '‘allative’.
            Nouns can never co-occur with such semantic role assigners. The fact that bound pronominals, rather than
            nouns, are governed by semantic role assigners suggests that Kadiwéu is a pronominal argument language
            of the Jelinek rather than the Baker type. In addition, the results of several syntactic tests support the
            analysis —    passivization,   recursivity, coreference,   anaphora,   quantifiers, and the behavior     of wu-
            interrogatives ~- support the analysis.
                This dissertation also shows that the major lexical categories present in Kadiwéu are nouns and verbs.
            Kadiwéu lacks prepositions entirely. I show that structures previously analyzed as containing prepositional
            phrases are in fact serial verb constructions.
                 Finally, I present the criteria I used to classify the Kadiwéu roots as nouns or verbs. Verbs are those
            elements which are valent; that is, that have an argument structure. Valency representation contains
            information about the number of arguments a verb requires
                                                                and the semantic nature
                                                                                    of those arguments. I
           determine the valency of a Kadiwéu root according to (i) the meaning of a bare root and (ii) the meaning
            of a stem consisting of the reot plus a valency suffix. Although Kadiwéu has valent roots, it has no
            transitive roots.   I understand transitivity as the capacity of assigning theta-roles to complements.
            Transitivity is assigned syntactically via verb movement. This dissertation has implications for language
           typology and linguistic parameters. Jelinek & Demers’ 1994 prediction that transitivity is assigned at the
            syntactic level in all languages whose arguments are pronominals, rather than nominal phrases or an
            empty pro, is borne out by Kadiwéu. | propose a parametric variation based on an insight in Fukui &
            Speas 1986 to account for pronominal argument languages. I argue that in these languages verbs do not
            project. On this hypothesis, clauses in pronominal argument languages are formed by raising of a valent
            lexical item to adjoin a light verb, which is a functional category able to theta-assign.","[4, 5, 6, 7]"
"
                   Grimshaw proposes that verbs in English have an a-structure and are theta-markers.          Eventive           nominals in English have an a-structure as well, but they cannot assign theta-role. Therefore. in order to           have grammatical arguments, eventive nouns need a theta-assigner. Thus, eventive nouns appear with a           preposition in English (e.g. donation of money to hospitals) and with a light verb in some constructions of           Japanese. My proposal is that Kadiwéu does not have any lexical category that is able to theta-assign. The          elements that [ classify as verbs in Kadiwéu        are similar to eventive nominals of of better known          languages: they are valent (i.e. have an argument structure in Grimshaw's terminology) but they are not

"              Much of the work on SVCs is concerned with the fact that the constituent verbs of a SVC must share a           subject, but several authors have pointed out that the constituent verbs of a SVC must also share the theme           argument. As observed in Baker 1989. the theme argument of the first verb in a SVC is understood also as           the theme argument of the second verb. and when V2 take an object. this object must be marked as an           indirect object. This is the case with Kadiwéu SVCs. In 261 and 263 -ati and ka- normally take a direct           internal argument, but their object must be marked as an indirect object (i.e. an enclitic followed by a           semantic role marker) when they are part of a SVC. as in 262 and 264.7           (261)    Maria      — yati                      lod:a:jo.

First, pronominal clitics and affixes co-occur with elements which are roughly like English prepositions        in that they assign semantic roles: -d: 'theme', -wa ~ -ma ‘dative’, -dom ~ -lo ~ -ma ‘benefactive'. -g ‘goal’. -lokom        ‘adessive', and -k ‘allative'. Nouns   never co-occur with such semantic        role assigners. The   fact that bound       pronominals, rather than nouns, are governed by semantic role assigners suggests that Kadiwéu is a pronominal       argument language of the Jelinek rather than the Baker type. In addition, the results of several syntactic tests. for       instance passivization --- which affects pronominals but not nominal phrases -~ support the hypothesis.",[14]

"              Second. consider the facts of Kadiwéu relativization. In most languages. the object of a preposition can           be relativized:           (245)     Mary killed a chicken with a knife           (246)     The knife with which Mary killed the chicken
               The   nominal phrase referring to the object of -ati, nod:a:jo ‘knife’. cannot be relativized in 247           however. and this suggests that we are not dealing with prepositional phrases. If -ati were a preposition.           the relativization of nod:a:jo ‘knife’ should be possible. as it is in 248.   One possible explanation for the           ungrammaticality of 247 would be to say that Kadiwéu might not accept preposition stranding.               But          example 248 shows that this is not the case; in fact. 248 shows that the object of -ati can be relativized if          -ati functions as a main verb:          (247)         *ika        nod:a:jo         ane              Maria       yel:wadi

Although the facts above indicate that we are dealing with biclausal           structures, many differences emerge when we compare the sentences in 236-239 with biclausal structures           such as coordination and control.","[107, 108]"

               Moreover. observe that in a control structure like the one in 267 both verbs must be morphologically           marked by a subject prefix: there is no subordinate verb in Kadiwéu which is not marked by a subject           prefix. SVCs have a different agreement pattern — a serial verb is not morphologically marked by a           subject prefix if the subject of the closed-class verb and the object of the open-class verb are semantically           the same:

Kadiwéu control           structures allow relativization of any of the objects: for instance. as can be seen in 270, the object of V2           can be relativized in a control structure. As we have already seen, this is not the case of a SVC.",[113]
"       This is not the case in Kadiwéu: mood and aspect markers precede subject and object markers. Mood and certain       aspect markers are simple proclitics (Zwicky 1977) which can occur as independent words (58). or attach to either       a the verbal stem (59) or a complementizer (60):°

               Kadiwéu has no tense markers, but aspect -—- that is. the way the grammar marks the duration or type of       temporal     activity denoted         by   the   verb   -—- is marked     on the   verb.

                This disscrtation has also shown that Kadiwéu         lacks prepositions entirely. and that the structures            analyzed by Griffiths as containing prepositional phrases are actually biclausal. The fact that adverbs can            modify either of the lexical heads comprising those structures indicates that we are dealing with two verbs            rather than with a verb and a preposition. Moreover, relativization also indicates that we are dealing with            biclausal structures. The structures discussed in this paper have many of the properties attributed to SVCs            across languages: arguments must be shared, the negation of one head implies the negation of the whole            string, and the actions expressed by serial verbs are simultaneous. Further fieldwork will be necessary to            test whether pronominals can also be considered arguments in SVCs.               In any case, this dissertation            suggests that the patterns of SVCs still need to be sorted out in theoretical linguistics.","[138, 139]"
"            >>    Note. however. that transitivizing suffixes are not present when the object is third person. It seems that            constructions whose object is understood as third person are in fact like such English sentences as John            ate. that is, semantically there are two arguments (we know that John ate some food). but syntactically the            construction is intransitive.            *¢          assume that pronominals are elements of a non-projecting D(eterminer) category: that is. a
            functional category that bears person and number features. The claim that D does not project is supported            by    the     fact   that   quantifiers   appear   incorporated   to   locative   predicates   in   Kadiwéu.    Moreover.           demonstratives are likely to be verbs and there is no articles. Kadiwéu is not the only nonconfigurational           language to lack determiner projections. Bittner & Hale 1995 argue that Walpiri has no items of the           syntactic category D.",[147]
"
         Spontaneous speech illustrating free constituent order is not easy to find in Kadiwéu because nominal phrases are       usually absent in this language. Any inflected verb in Kadiwéu corresponds to a complete sentence in English:       (151)     jib:a:taGawa.

            'S    Recall that the subject of transitive clauses is marked when the object is third-person: when the object            is first- or second-person. the verb is marked by an object pronoun.            Since passivization demotes the           subject of transitive clauses. passivization occurs exclusively when the verb has a third-person object --           that is, when a transitive clause has an overt subject. In this respect. passivization in Kadiwéu is similar to           passivization with the clitic se in Romance languages, which only occurs with third-person objects.","[143, 144]"

             3.2.3. Diminutive. Kadiwéu has two diminutive suffixes that encode gender: -nig:i ‘masculine diminutive’       and -na ‘feminine diminutive’. The diminutive suffixes are very productive in that they can co-occur with any       nominal root. Voiced short obstruents are devoiced before a diminutive suffix:

            3.2.4. Number. Kadiwéu has five plural suffixes -(a)di, -pi, -Ga. -dodi, and -al:i. The suffix -a/:i is a plural       suffix used exclusively with nouns that refer to objects that have an elongated form (nod:a:jol-:i ‘knifes'). The       choice among ail the other plural suffixes seem to be lexically determined. The suffixes -adi and -al:i are realized       as -di and -/:i . respectively. when they attach to a stem ending in a vowel. All the elements in a noun phrase must       agree in number:       (131)      nGidiwa                         nekecodi                      nabidaGaGa

The suffix -jegi ‘source’ is used to derive nouns from        other nouns. The suffix -jegi causes the devoicing of the last voiced stop of a root (nigotaGa 'city', nigotaqajegi        ‘citizen’). Kadiwéu has a suffix -awa ‘like’ which is used to derive nouns from nouns that contain a diminutive        suffix. Some of these constructions involve reduplication of the last phonological foot (recall that fect are formed       from right to left in Kadiwéu):       (134)         nig:anig:awa:nigi

"            Jelinek claims that the Theta-Criterion applies verb-internally in pronominal argument languages. The fact that        pronominal clitics and affixes, rather than nouns, co-occur with semantic role markers in Kadiwéu suggests that        the Theta-Criterion must indeed be applied verb-internally in some languages.                  One could question whether the        semantic role markers are attached to pronominals at the phonological level. If this were the case, Baker's        approach still could be maintained.          If the argument phrases are an empty pro. the logical possibility is to cliticize        them to the verb at the phonological level. There is, however, evidence suggesting that the phenomenon is truly        morphological. Table 5 (repeated here as Table 11 for convenience), a schematic representation of Kadiwéu verb        structure,     shows     that the pronominal-semantic       role assigner clusters occur        deeply   embedded       in the verb        morphology.       Pronominal clitics and affixes are further inside the verb structure than inflectional morphemes such       as aspect, mood, directionals, and plural markers. The pluralizer -waji has different semantic scope according to       the verbal valency: it pluralizes the subject prefix if the clause is intransitive (202), but it pluralizes an internal       argument if the verb has one (203). The fact that -wayi accesses the internal morphological boundaries of the verbal       stem to establish its semantic scope indicates that this morpheme cannot be attached to the verb at the phonological       level.   A morpheme which is attached to the verb at the phonological level (simple clitic) cannot access the lexical       properties of its host. The fact that Kadiwéu semantic role morphemes are inside -waji in the verb structure       indicates that those morphemes also cannot attach to the verb at the level of phonological form.

              4.2.2. Syntactic Tests. In this section I show. by means of a variety of syntactic tests. that all the            available evidence indicates that Kadiwéu is indeed a pronominal argument language.","[90, 91, 92]"
"                 Note in examples 236-239 that the second element taking an internal argument has been translated             into English as a preposition.     One might argue that Kadiwéu does not have two verbs in the sentences             above, but a verb and a preposition.      Indeed. Griffiths 1991 analyzes examples 237-239 as containing             prepositional phrases, rather than verbs with ""preposition-like properties”. However, the fact that a word             can be translated as a preposition does not mean that that word is a preposition. The first problem that we             face in analyzing roots like -ati, ka-. and d:i- as prepositions is that we will have to postulate that             Kadiwéu has homophonous verbs and prepositions, because 240 and 241 show that such roots can            function as main verbs.    Example 240 differs from example 236 in that 240 has a main and a subordinate             clause, as indicated by the presence of the complementizer me.",[105]
"           °°      The claim that nominal phrases in Kadiwéu are adjuncts predicts that the coindexation of a
           pronominal subject and a noun inside a nominal phrase referring to the object is allowed because the           pronominal subject will not c-command the nominal phrase referring to the object. Note. however. that           sentences such as (i) are ungrammatical.          A pronominal cannot be coreferent with a noun inside a           possessive   phrase.    The same     phenomenon    is attested in other nonconfigurational      languages   such   as           Navajo, Warlpiri, and Arandic languages (Ken Hale. personal communication. 1995). The only language          that allows coreference between a pronominal and a noun in a possessive clause is Mohawk (Baker 1994).",[145]
"           1.2.2. Braggio 1981.         Braggio 1981 is a description of Kadiwéu phonology. including a discussion of some       morphophonemic rules which affect subject and object prefixes. This work is based solely on 23 verbal paradigms.       and therefore several aspects of the language's phonology and morphology were misanalyzed. The author presents       a systematic transcription of Kadiwéu, clearly distinguishing long and short consonants; however, she postulates       that long consonants occur in stressed syllables only, and are therefore predictable.

         Kadiwéu long and short consonants are phonemically distinct. Braggio observes that subject and object prefixes do         not co-occur, and she tries to account for this complementary distribution of subject and object markers via         phonological rules. My data shows, however, that there is no plausible phonological basis for the complementarity         of subject and object prefixes in Kadiwéu. Moreover, Braggio complicates the Kadiwéu pronominal system by         postulating two sets of distinct subject prefixes. Kadiwéu has only one set of subject prefixes: these undergo regular         phonological alternations according to the semantic case suffix that follows them.","[15, 16]"

Fukui & Speas' claim does not seem to be on the right           track. [ assume that all languages have both functional and lexical categories. Doing so. I must redefine           the nature of Fukui & Speas' parametric variation. My proposal differs from those of Fukui & Speas 1986           and Fukui    1986 in that I claim that the parametric variation does not consist in whether functional           categories are present or not, but in whether functional (FC) and lexical categories (LC) are able or not           able to project:

              According to my proposal. in languages like English (type A) recursive nominal phrase arguments are           not allowed due to the projection of functional categories. In languages like Japanese (type B) recursion of           nominal phrase arguments is not blocked, because only lexical categories project. In pronominal argument           languages (type C) nominal phrase arguments do not exist. because lexical categories do not project. No           Type D languages are attested.","[134, 135]"
"                   Questions regarding categorical distinctions have occupied a central place in linguistics. Chomsky           (1986b and later works)           makes     a distinction between      lexical categories. which are defined over the           features [+/-noun, +/-verb], and functional categories, which include the following grammatical elements:           complementizer, determiner, tense, and light verbs. According to Chomsky, cross-linguistic differences           are not random. but they are confined to a specific component of grammar. The parametric variation           across languages lies in inflectional categories rather than in lexical categories. Therefore, the proposal           that Salishan languages lack a lexical contrast between nouns and verbs is incompatible with Chomsky's           proposal.",[118]

           Genitive constructions are formed by juxtaposing nouns; the head of the genitive phrase must be preceded       by a possessive proclitic and the classifier n- if the head is an alienably possessed noun. The nouns composing a       genitive construction can follow any order in relation to each other:       (125)         Gonel:e:giwa           liGeladi

           The complement of copular clauses in Kadiwéu is always a noun phrase. Kadiwéu does not have adjectives: all       non-verbal roots have identical syntactic properties. Elements which are expressed by adjectives in languages like       English are expressed by nouns (168-169) or intransitive verbs (170-171)            in Kadiwéu (see 4.4 for criteria for       lexical category classification).

              Noble and Non-noble Kadiwéu        differ in that Noble Kadiwéu              lacks long semivowels.   Long scmivowels        correspond to /iy/ and AwV/ in Noble Kadiwéu, where V is a mid vowel:        (1)       Noble Kadiwéu               Non-noble Kadiwéu                   Gloss                  i-weel:ate-di               i-w:el:ate-di                       ""my shoes'                  Niiyal:e                    niy:al:e                            ‘tree’              One could postulate that the segments /y:/ and /w:/ are underlyingly /iy/ and /wV/ in Non-noble Kadiwéu and       that these sequences undergo an obligatory phonological that turns them into long semivowels. However. I avoid a       rule of obligatory neutralization, since cases of /iy/ and /wV/ do occur in Non-noble Kadiwéu:
       (2)         Noble Kadiwéu               Gloss                   iy:onig:i                   ‘my son'                   liwelse                     ‘its thorn’
              A glottal stop occurs in word-final position after al! vowels in both Noble and Non-noble Kadiwéu. Since this       is completely predictable, I have not analyzed glottal stop as a phoneme or as an allophone of some phoneme.","[26, 27]"
"                This result has implications for language typology and linguistic parameters. Jelinek & Demers' 1994            prediction that transitivity is assigned at the syntactic level in all languages whose arguments      are            pronominals, rather than nominal phrases or an empty pro, is borne out by Kadiwéu. I have proposed a           parametric variation based on an insight in Fukui & Speas 1986 to account for pronominal argument           languages. I argued that these languages are languages in which lexical categories do not project. On this           hypothesis, clauses in pronominal argument languages are formed by raising of a valent lexical item to           adjoin a functional category that functions as a light verb. Light verbs enable valent elements to theta-           assign.",[137]
"           The structure of the Kadiwéu noun resembles noun structure in other Waikunian languages as well as in most       western South American languages. The presence of classifiers/nominalizers marking inalienable possession seems       to be an areal feature of the languages of western lowland South America. According to Payne 1990. classifiers       marking   inalienably possessed   nouns are present in Maipuran.       Cariban,   Arauan,    and Candoshi   languages:       Facundes 1995 shows that genitive classifiers marking inalienable possession are also present in Apurina. an       Arawakan language spoken in the western Amazonian area. There are three types of possessed nouns in the       Waikunian languages: Class I. nouns that must be possessed and do not take a prefix n-; Class II. nouns that can       be possessed and that take the prefix n-: Class II, nouns that are never possessed, and refer to things from nature.       e.g. storm, rain, and river. The prefix n- is a classifier that marks alienably possessed nouns. Kadiwéu nouns are       further organized into subclasses marked by classifier suffixes.   Kadiwéu. like Toba and Mocovi. has a diminutive       suffix added to nouns which encodes gender distinction (m/f).",[50]
"              The hypothesis that nominal phrases are adjuncts predicts that anaphoric                    expressions     such as          himself/herself/themselves       and    referential   quantifiers   such   as each   other   will   be   nonexistent   in          pronominal argument languages, since their presence would lead to a violation of Condition A of the          Binding Theory. The coindexation of an anaphoric element to an adjunct nominal phrase would lead to a          violation of Condition A of the Binding Theory. which states that an anaphoric clement must be bound by          a c-commanding antecedent in argument position.'? -*°
              Since reflexives and reciprocals are expressed by verbal morphology in Kadiwéu. this prediction also          holds here:

              Although anaphors are predicted to be nonexistent in pronominal argument languages. logophoric or          emphatic pronouns are possible. Such pronominals are elements in A-bar positions, which do not require          a structurally defined antecedent (Reinhart & Reuland 1991). Kadiwéu does not have anaphoric elements.          but it does have emphatic pronouns. These emphatic pronouns, like other Kadiwéu nominal phrases, are          recursive.",[98]
"
             Kadiwéu      has two types of interrogative      constructions.       Complements       are questioned by means   of the       incorporation of the interrogative ame in a locative/existential predicate:

"       There is only one form for the plural demonstrative, id:iwa. The plural marker -wa can also be used to mean       ‘Kadiwéu nationality’ or ‘pertaining to the Kadiwéus' (e.g. ad:iwa iwal:o ‘that Kadiwéu woman sitting’ vs. ad:i       iwal:o ‘that woman sitting’). Absence is always marked by the morpheme                    *k:a; when the object or person is       present,   however,      the form   varies   according   to position   (static/moving).    Table   10   shows   the Waikunian       demonstrative system.",[71]
"           '0     In active systems the agent argument of a transitive verb is marked like the sole argument of an           unergative verb. which is also an agent semantically. Nonagent arguments (and also possessives) are           marked by a different set of prefixes. In this system agent arguments form a natural class, distinct from           nonagents.       Vestiges of an active system are found in all the Waikurian         languages. and has been           reconstructed for Proto-Waikurdan (Ceria & Sandalo       1995). Although Kadiwéu       marks   Isg, Ipl, 2sp/pl.           and 3sg      subjects of unergative and unaccusative verbs by the same set of    of prefixes. there are some           unaccusative verbs that must be marked by an object prefix instead of a subject prefix (see dictionary):           (i)    God:awela
                  Go-d:-awela
                  [pl.OBJ-theme-scare                  ""We are scared.'",[142]
"           *7     The parametric variation proposed here is substantially different the one in Baker 1994. My proposal           can account for the existence of languages in which pronominals, rather than nominal phrases. are verbal           arguments. It does not mean that languages in which a small pro is an argument do not exist. But if they           do, they cannot be derived from the same parametric variation. Baker (personal communication,                        1995)           mentions that there are at leat two types of nonconfigurational languages: (a) languages which have empty           categories pro as arguments and whose verbs are overtly marked by agreement (Mohawk),                              and (b)           languages whose verbal arguments are pro, but whose verbs are not marked by agreement morphemes           (Jiwarli). Jiwarli does not have bound pronominals, but it shares a remarkable number of features with           languages        as Mohawk.      Kadiwéu     presents   evidence for a third class of noncofigurational         languages:           languages in which bound pronominals are arguments.",[147]

Verb and Noun Morphology           The structure of the verb seems to be similar in all the Waikurdan languages.* The verb agrees with the subject        and object in person and number (sg/pl). Kadiwéu, Toba, and Mocovi mark subject person with prefixes. but        number (pl) is marked with a suffix immediately following the root, although               in Kadiwéu the pluralizing        morpheme for the third-person subject of transitive and unaccusative verbs is a prefix. All Waikurian languages        have a directional prefix n- ‘hither’ which is added to a verb stem. They also have a set of enclitics which mark       direction and motion. Aspect and mood, but not tense, are marked on the verb in Waikurian languages. Kadiwéu       has seven aspect markers -- completive/incompletive/durative, telic/atelic, repetitive. and intensive — and two       mood markers. conditional and desiderative. There are also three negation markers.              Among   the Waikurian       languages, only Kadiwéu has a set of semantic role markers.","[49, 50]"
"             Valency in Thomason             et al.'s terminology corresponds to the lexical semantics of a predicate in           generative grammar.        Generative grammarians have been trying to capture the lexical properties of           predicates in formal representations since Chomsky 1965. The context-sensitive subcategorization rules of           Chomsky 1965 ware the first attempt to represent the semantics of a verb. More recently, lexical semantic           representations have taken the form of predicate decomposition (Carter 1976, Dowty                       1976, Jackendoff           1976,     1987,   1990),   Hale     &     Keyser   1987,   Rappaport     &     Levin   1988,   Zubizarreta   1985).   These           representations are generally termed Conceptual Structures or Lexical Conceptual Structures (LCS) and

           are primarily focused on representing the syntactically relevant parts of verb meaning. Grimshaw 1990           presents further development in the understanding of the lexical semantics of predicates. According to           Grimshaw, nouns and verbs have a lexico-semantic representation (LCS). but verbs and eventive nominals           are distinct from regular nouns in that only the former include an aspectual dimension in addition to a           LCS (a-structure). Thus. according to Grimshaw. verbs and eventive nominals have an a-structure. while           nouns lack an a-structure. A complete understanding of the semantics of a predicate is still subject of           research,   Tenny   1994 and   Levin &    Rappaport    1995,   for instance.   present   further articulation    of           Grimshaw's a-structure.","[118, 119]"
"           In 4.2.1 I show that pronominal clitics and affixes co-occur with elements that assign semantic roles. The fact       that pronominal clitics and affixes, rather than nouns, are governed by semantic role assigners suggests that       Kadiweu is a pronominal argument language of the Jelinek type rather than of the Baker type. In 4.2.2 a variety of       syntactic tests, for instance passivization — which affects pronominals but not nominal phrases — will be applied

                In more recent work Chomsky’s uniform bar-level hypothesis. according to which the number of bars            for maximal projection is uniform across categories, has been questioned. For instance. Fukui & Speas            (1986) argue that functional categories are limited to a single specifier position and a single complement            position. By contrast, lexical categories project recursively as long as they have theta-roles to assign. In            other words. the projection of lexical categories has been assumed to correlate with their capacity to assign            theta-roles. Now, there are several pieces of evidence that verbs cannot assign theta-roles in Kadiwéu. If            the projection of lexical categories is indeed tied to their ability to assign theta-roles, that entails that            Kadiwéu verbs do not project.","[133, 134]"

Although there are pieces of evidence supporting the claim that there are two verbs in           Kadiwéu SVCs, at the argument-structure level the verbs are merged. Note in the sentences below that the           subject \faria ‘Mary’ is understood as the agent of both verbs. The SVC differs from coordination in that           the noun phrase Afaria cannot precede both verbs in a SVC:

"           This work has implications for studies of language typology and linguistic parameters. Jelinek & Demers' 1994       prediction that transitivity is assigned at the syntactic level in all languages whose arguments are pronominals.       rather than nominal phrases or an empty pro, is borne out by Kadiwéu. Kadiwéu roots resemble nouns of better-       known languages in that they are not transitive; that is, they cannot assign theta-roles to complements. Thomason       at al. 1994 argue that transitivity and valency must be distinguished. The facts of Kadiwéu support this proposal.",[14]

Some children answered Pau! and John’s mother respectively: these children's first           language was Portuguese, however, and they learned Portuguese outside the village. Children who learned           Portuguese in the village answered Joseph and Joao, respectively, even when the test was applied in           Portuguese, that is. when the stories and questions were conducted in Portuguese.

               Additional examples are shown in 215-218. All the available evidence shows that a pronominal in a            Kadiwéu main clause can be coreferential with a nominal phrase in a complement clause. The data on            coreference constitutes strong evidence that pronominals. rather than pro, are arguments in Kadiwéu.'®

If             nominal phrases are indeed           adjuncts in Kadiwéu, therefore, they should be recursive. There are many examples which come both from           texts and from elicited sentences that show that nominal phrases are indeed recursive. Observe in 219 that           there arc three nominal phrases referring to the object. and in 220 there are two nominal phrases referring

            Kadiwéu has two dialects which reflect gender and social status: the most salient differences between            Noble and Non-noble Kadiweéu are at the level of suprasegmental phonology. Noble Kadiwéu parses the            word into binary trochees. Non-noble Kadiwéu presents a rare stress system: it parses the word into            iterative ternary feet. Comparison of Kadiwéu prosody with the prosody of the other Waikurian languages            suggests that Non-noble Kadiwéu stress patterns were introduced through interference from Portuguese            and/or Spanish. Chapter 3 comprises a detailed description of the grammatical morphemes found in the            noun and in the verb.,[138]
