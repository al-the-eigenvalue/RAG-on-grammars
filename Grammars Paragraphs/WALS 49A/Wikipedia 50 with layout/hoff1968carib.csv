"48 The melodie rise, and the expression of a certain 'incompleteness' are strongly
   reminiscent of what Bolinger, writing about English, has called the B-accent;
   in o.c. pp. 147, 143.
49 This rise and the relation between two word-groups as described here, also
   occur when no shift of accent is possible because the word is always accented
   on the last vowel, or even contains only one vowel. E.g. o:ruwá ~'u:1""It tïtunda
    má!1, kasi:ri su:ka:toiJ kaba 'the third hoor just began, when they already
    sieved the cassava beer'.

 2) No supplementation in the same sentence.
   Two kinds of cases are known to me.
    In the first place the melodie rise with shift of accent was found
 in two sentences, expressing a question, respectively a request. In the
first sentenee the phenomenon occurs in ayu:pa:kái 'have you woken
up', in the second sentence in ipo:tna'J'jgakó 'stir it up': ""ayu:pa:kái he
ya:konó"" kïfJga:no i:wa ""'have you woken up, my friend"", he said to
him'. ""waxto ipo:'l'nafJgakó"" kifJga:no ""'stir up the fire"", she said'.
   I think that, unlike the preceding cases, the rise does not link up
the first group with the second group. It seems more probable that
theanticipation expressed by the rise concerns the intended reaction
of the listener.
   Secondly the phenomenon was observed more than onee in sentences
which, in the course of a story, merely indicated that the joumey was
continued: irombo kinïxsa:tóij 'then they set out', te kïnïxsa:tófJ na:pa
'then they set out again'. In these cases too, the rise can very weU be
explained as expressing incompleteness, hinting at the continuation of
the story.
                       3. MORPHOLOGY
                         3.0.       INTRODUCTION   Morphologica1 investigation is primarily eoneemed wÏJth the syste-
matie fonnal-sernantic correlations which may exist in the lexicon of a
language. It brings to light morphologica1 eategories, i.e. series of
words between which there is semantic and fonnal proportionality.l
Besides these morphologica1 categories proper, cart:egories of another
type may be found, which I sha11 call syntactica1 categories. Instead of
a formal-semantic proportionality, they show a forrnal-synttactic pro-
portionality only: in opposition to other categories of words they share
both a forrna1 feature and a potential for entering into certain syn:tactic
constructions. All these proportionalities are best described in tenns
of a process tenninology.
   In the second place, morphological investigation has to answer tbe
question to what extent and in what way the categories are imerrelated,
constituting systems which are generally called parts of speech or
(morphologica1) word classes. In a number of languages these systems
ean be thought of as being largely autonomous, 1mt for the frequently
occurring relations that are dealt with under the headings of 'trans-
position' or hypostasis. This morphologica1 model may be represented
by the following diagram: 2            I                   I(1)        1                    2            I                   I
  It is certain, however, that in other languages the word classes
show a smaller or larger amount of overlapping, because they mutually

share a part of their categories. In such cases there are at least two
other conceivable mode1s of description. 3 The hierarchic model would
apply in those cases where systems form part of more-embracing super-
systems. These super-systems in their turn may, of course, form part
of still larger wholes.
  This might he symbolized as follows:                                                   1                                                   2

however, partly overlap. A represents categories which are found in
system 1 as well as in system 2, B represents categories which are found
both in system 3 and in system 4, while C represents categories that
occur in all four systems. 4
  The chain-model would apply in those cases wh ere some relatively
autonomous system shares same of its categories with certain other
systems, and some of its other categories again with other systems.
What I mean may be illustrated by the following diagram:                                           1                                          2

   how many different models it might he possible to conceive. The question as
   to how far the first model has been developed under the influence of the
   traditional theory of word classes also cannot he gone into here.

   described by him is possible. See C. F. Hockett, A course in modern linguistics,
   New York 1958, pp. 221-222.
                                       MORPHOLOGY                                         107   Of the four systems, 1, 2 and 3 share certain eategories, on the
one hand, represented by A. On the other hand, 3 shares some other
eategories with 4, represented by B. It is this double affinity of 3
which makes it impossible to arrange the systems in a hierarchic
structure.
   N ow it seems to me that the most adequate method of description
for Carib is a combination of methods (1) and (3). The main COtl-
c1usion of my morphological investigation is that in this language there
are six morphologieal systems to he distinguished, one of which, that
of the numerals, is c1early separated from the other five: those of the
verbs, nouns, postpositions, adjectives and demonstratives; which
together ean he adequateiy described with the aid of model (3). Thus,
a schematic picture of the morphology of Carib may he given in the

In the diagram the dimensions of the areas give an approximate
indieation of the extent of the six systems and of the degree to which
they overlap.
   Let us now first COtlsider the five systems of categories (or word
classes, the term that will he used from now on) which, while showing
differences, at the same time share same unmistakable agreements. As
to the differences, it is only the verbs (1) that have, for instanee,
eategories of tense and mood, only the nouns (2) that have a general-
 108                        THE CARIB LANOUAGE
ising category with the suffix -wa:no, only the postpositions (3) that
have a reflexive category with as-, only the postpositiOt15 and the
adjectives (3, 4) that have a no-category, the members of which
designate persons or things characterized by a property which is
designated by the corresponding monomorphematic word,5 while only
the demonstratives (5) have a category with the suffix -ba1j, the
members of which characterize persons or things as belonging to a
certain kind. Examples:
(1) e:ne   to see         sene:ya        I see it
(2) epi:ti medicine       opi:wa:no      medicines in genera! 6
(3) uwa:po before         asll :'wa:po   before each other
(3) uwa:po before         uwa:pono       one who is before
(4) ka:wo high            ka:wono        a high one
(5) e:ro   this           e:roba1j       one of this kind.
   Of the agreements the main one is the presence of the same set
of five personal prefix-categories in the verbs (1), nouns (2) and
postpositions (3); these categories are represented in the diagram by
area A. The foUowing examples show one of these five categories,
viz. the one with the value 'second person', formed by prefixing
with ay-:
(1) e:ne   to see    aye:ne    to see you
(2) epi:tï medici ne aye:pi:tï your medici ne
(3) uwa:po before    ayu:wa:po before you
   The fact that the postpositions take part in these pers<mal formations,
while the adjectives do not, is one reason for regarding them as
different word classes. The second reason is that, whereas the reflexive
as-category 7 occurs with the postpositions, it does not with the adjec-
tives. On the other hand, the adjectives do not have any categories
which are not found in the postpositions as weU. This is indicated in
the diagram by the shading of the bottom area, shared by the adjec-
tives (4) and the postpositions (3). Whereas the adjectives are limited
to this bottom area, the postpositions belong to the two bottom areas,
as well as to the large area A, shared with (1) and (2).
IiIt is true that this 1I0-category is not only found with postpositions and
  adjectives but a1so with the nouns and verbs; with the latter, however, the
  no-process requires combination with certain other morphological processes,
  whose occurrence does nat depend on -no.
6 Suffixing is combined with modification of the base, con5isting in 105S of the
  final syllable and replacement of c by o.
7 As discussed above.
                                   MORPHOLOGY                                 109     The classes of verbs (1), nouns (2) and demonstratives (5) agree
  in having a category formed by suffixing with -mbo, the members of
  which share a value 'distance, discrepancy', either in a temporal or
  in some other sense (area B in the diagram). Demonstratives (5) and
  nouns (2) agree in having a plural formed by suffixing with -kofJ
  (area C), nouns (2) and verbs (1) agree in having a category of
 negation, formed by suffixing with -xpa or -~ma (area D). Examples: 8
  (1) e:ne      to see   enembo      away from seeing
                         enexpa      unseen
 (2) epi:tï     medicine epi:tïmbo medici ne that is not effective or no
                                     longer used
                         epi:tïko~   medicines
                         epi:mma without medicine
 (5) e:ro      this      e:rombo     this, no longer present
                         e:roko~     these
    Class 6, that ofthe numerals, differs from the other five, in having,
 among other things, a category with the suffix -mboto 'by . . . at a
 time'; e.g.:
 (6) o:wiiJ one          o:u!imboto once.
    Whether there is any agreement between (6) and other classes is
open to doubt. The llUmerals have a category with the suffix -no,
which appears to show semantic agreement with· the no-category found
in the postpositions as well as in the adjectives, discussed above.
 Examples:
(6) o:ko       two       o:kono     the second
(3) uwa:po before        uwa:pono one who is before
( 4) ka:wo high          ka:wono    a high ooe.
An important difference between the numeral no-formations and those
on the basis of adjectives and postpositions is, however, that the
former have all the morphological and syntaotic properties of the mono-
morphematic nouns, whereas this is not the case with the adjectives
and postpositions. lt would therefore he hetter to regard the numeral
no-category as a transposition to the class of nouns (represented in
the diagram by a long arrow) than to identify it with the no-category
in (3) and (4).","[123, 124, 125, 126, 127, 128, 129]"

3.2.1.   SYNTACTIC CATEGORIES
3.2.1.1. FORMATION AND SYNTACTIC VALENCE  In a large part of the nouns we find two formaIly distinct categories,
between which there is no semantic difference but only a difference
in syntactic valenee. The members of these syntactic categories, here
provisionally designated A and B, are found as follows: A in isolation,
and besides in all word-groups where no members of the other category
occur, B in groups formed by the noun being directly connected with
a preceding other noun or nom,inal group, or also with a preceding

or thing and does not perform the function of an article, in which
case A occurs. Examples:
A) kuri:yara! 'a baat!'; e:ro po:no kuri:yara 'a boat from here';
kuri:}'ara am wo:pïrï sene:ya 'I see a boat coming' (am 'a', wo:pïrï
'to come'); with a demonstrative: mo:ro kuri:yara wo:pïrï sene:ya
'I see the boat coming' (mO':ro 'that, the').
B) kasi:ri ku:riya:rarï 'boat for cassava-beer' (kasi:ri 'cassava-beer') ;
moxko ya:wo ku:riya:rarï 'my uncle's boat' (moxko ya:wo 'my uncle') ;
with a demonstrative: moxko ku:riya:rarï wo:pïrï sene:ya 'I see his
boat coming' (moxko 'he, his').
   \\Te now pass on to the description of the formal difference between
the two categories.
   Apart from certain cases with vowel-a1ternation, which will be dis-
cussed presently, the situatiOll is as follows:
The members of A are monomorphematic nouns;
The corresponding words in Bare forn1ed by suffixation with one of
the following a1ternants:
1) -rï
2) -rtt
3) -ni
4) -di
The first alternant occurs when the monomorphematic noun ends 111
avowel other than u, the second when it ends in ti. Examples:
A) kuri:yara        B) ku:riya:rarï    boat
   to,'Ptt              to:puYtt       stone 86
The third alternant occurs when rthe mOllomorphematic noun ends in
a nasal, ex cept in one case, e:rafJ 'watchman', where the 4th alternant
was found: Examples:
A) a,'si~                 B) a:si:ni              heat
   e:rlIf3                   e:randï              watchman
  The productive character of the formations with -nï, at least where e
precedes the nasal, is perhaps shown by the occurrence of -nï in two
recent loanwords from Sranan:
86    In a number of cases suffixation is accompanied by contract ion : we :we/we :rï
     'wood', wï:wïjwï:rï 'axe'; we:yu/weiru 'sun', sese:wu/seseuru 'fringe on a
      garment'; ki)'e:rejïxkerc :rï 'cassava'.

      ske1j                ske:nï           body
    In a number of isolated cases the rule given above does not apply.
 Vowel-change iustead of -rï was fottnd in:
A) auxto              B) auxtï              house
      pa:to                pa:tï            place, spot
   Besides there are a number of cases, including some words denoting
 next-of-kin, which are completely unsystematic from a formal point
 of view:

   In some words there is, besides the suffix, another formal dif-
ference between A and B, which consists in A beginning with 0 or 0:
and B with e or e:. My material contains the following cases:
A) o:ma              B) e:mari             path
     O':mï                emï:ri          louse

   As I have not specially investigated the phenomenon, it is very weil
possible that the e/o-altemation occurs in many more cases than these87 Alongside sa:no and y!I:mï the regttlar formations fa:tarï and pa:parï occur,
   but always with a childish connotation.
88 Grandfather and paternal aunt are irregular, but not completely unsystematic:
   tamlt:si/ta:mltrlt 'grandfather', wo:pï/o:pirï 'paternal aunt'.
89 This pa:ti is undoubtedly identica1 with the word pa:tï 'place', which cor-
   relates as B-form with the A-form pa:to 'place'.

 of this limited material, both A and B may serve as the starting-point:
  (A -+ B) In certain A-nouns with initial 0 or 0: formation of B
 takes place partly by replacement of 0 or 0: with e or e:; or
  (B -+ A) In certain B-nouns with initial e or e: formation of A takes
 place by loss of -ri or -ru, and replacement of the initial vowe1 by
 oor 0:.
    An argument in favour of the first of these statements is that, as
 is usually the case, the shorter farm is held to serve as the base. YetI
 suspect that further investigation will show that the second statement
 is to be preferred. For one thing it is an established fact that there
are nouns that always begin with 0 or 0:; e.g.
A) oko:mo              B) oko:mori           wasp
      o:ti                 o:tiri            thing
      oxta                  oxta:ri          cave, hole
      oxto:no               oxtono:ri        cold
    This means that foreach of the A-nouns heginning with 0 or 0: it
would he necessary to state whether or not they replace the initial
vOIWel bye, e: in case of suffixation with -rï. On the other hand na
B-nouns with initial e, e: have sa far been found, to which an A-noun
 with o. 0: does not correspond. H fumher investigation. does not
bring to light such cases, the conc1usion will have to he that A is best
described on. the basis of B.
    The belief that it is the words with e, e: that are best regarded as
the base is strengthened by what we found in three verbal categories:
those with -xpo, -topo and -ne13 (3.1.2.2.). There ejo-alternation was
found to occur, too, with the same function as is performed in the
nouns by -ri and e j o-alternation together. N ow in these verbal cases
there is a conclusive reason for considering the form with e as the
base, viz. the fact that it is the initial vowe1 of the monomorphematic
verb. E.g.:

3.5.1. THE MONOMORPHEMATIC DEMONSTRATIVES
   First of all we are concerned with the twenty words in the table on
 page 270, most of them clearly of a deictic character,134 which are
closely related bath semantically and formally. Later on we shall discuss
 the morphological processes to which these words are subject.
   Let us first consider the seman.tic aspeots. An important part is
clearly played by two distinctions: indefinite as opposed to definite,
and inanimate as opposed to animate. 135
   Both indefinite and referring to an inanimate object are o:tï, o:we
and o:ya. Of these three words, o:we 'where' and o:ya 'whither', which
denote place and di rection , respectively, are distinguished from o:tï
'what, something', which does not have this spatial meaning. Examples:
o:we ko nafj? 'where is he?' (ko 'interrogative particle', naij 'is he'),
o:we na:re 'I don't know where' (na:re 'unknown to speaker').
o:ya ko nï:tofj? 'where has he gone?',
o:ya na:re 'I don't know where (whither)'.
o:tï ko e:ro na1j? 'what is this?' (e:ro 'this') ,
a:mu o:tï ye:nuru ta:ka nï:tofj 'something got into my eye' (a:mu 'a',
ye:nuru ta:ka 'into my eye', nï:tofj 'went').
   A special feature of o:tï is that besides its function as a demonstra-
tive, it ean also function as a noun or a verb. E.g. yo:tïrï 'something of
mine', kïno:tïyaij 'he does something'.
   Corresponding to o:tï 136 'what, something' is no:kï 'who, somebody',
as an indefinite demonstrative word referring to a living creature.","[289, 290, 291]"
"97 With the postpositions and the adjectives -mbo occurs on!y in combination
   with -no, apart from iso!ated instances Iisted in 3.3.8E. and 3.4.6B.
98 The occurrence of specia! alternants without x and y after diphthongs may
   be seen as a consequence of a genera! sequentia! ru!e, see 2.1.1.4.1.
226                         TUE CARIB LANGUAGE
    Also prediatable is the occurrenee of -~ma when the monomorphem-
atic noun ends in 1j or f'3 (which are dropped), and that of -~ma or -ma
when the monomorphematic noun ends in the syllable nï, which also
disappears when suffixation takes place 99. Again, -ma is used here
after a diphthong and -~ma after other vowels.
Examples:
PO:SI~1j 'sweetness', ipo:si~ma 'nat sweet'; e:rlDJ 'watchman', e:ra~ma
'unguarded'; ïxko:nï 'dirt', ixko~ma 'not dirtty'; a::~ 'heat', a:si~ma
'not hot'; exkïini 'smoke', exkiima 'not smoky'.
    In all other cases either -xpa or -~ma is found without it being
possible to give a rule.
Examples with -xpa: wo:to 'fish, meat', iwo:toxpa 'without fish, meat';
ixka:rï 'anything living in water', ixka:rixpa 'without living inhabitants';
u:ra 'weeping', uraxpa 'without weeping'.
Examples with -~ma: pe:tï 'thigh', ipe:tï~ma 'without a thigh'; ïiyo
'husband', iyo~ma 'unmarried (woman)' ; are:pa 'cassava', ere:pûma
'without cassava'.
    The fact that recent loanwords are suffixed with -xpa might he an
indica.tion that it is the productive altemant: e.g. bu:ku 'book', ibu:-
kuxpa 'not possessing books'. A further indication is perhaps the fact
that -~ma is not foond with verbs, although othe,rwise they form the
negative category in exactly the same way as nouns. 100
    A number of noons loses the final syllable before -xpa and -~ma.
This phenomenon occurs in all cases en ding in nï in my material, and
 in some of the cases in ti and ri, again without it being possible to
find a rule for the occurrence or Ilon-occurrence of the reduction.
    Ni is lost in amo:ni 'avarice', am()~ma 'not avaricious'; ere~nï 'quick-
ness, nimbleness', erûma 'motionless'; exkïinï 'smoke', exkïima 'not
smoky'; ïxko:ni 'dirt', ixko~ma 'not dirty'.
    Ri is lost in me:rï 'drawillg, marking', imexpa 'without marking'
  (said of skin of young animal) ; pi~'ri 'shyness', ipï:ixpa 'not shy';
 ye:rï 'tooth, sharpness', iyexpa 'toothless, blunt'; ra:rï 'flat surface',
iraxpa 'without a flat surface' ; apo:rï 'arm', apoxpa 'armless'; eka:ri
 'message' , ekaxpa 'without a message' ; ekï:ri 'thom' , ekixpa 'without DO Not only nï but also the final syllables nu, f'ï, kï and ti are lost before the
    suffix in certain cases; see further on in this section.
100 That is, as far as the transitive verbs are concerned. In intransitive verbs
    there is yet another difference: initial tv is lost in the verbs, while in the
    nouns w is treated as the other consonants, i.e. i- is prefixed before w. See
    3.1.3.2.6.
                               MORPHOLOGY                               227thorns'; epe:rï 'fruit', epexpa 'wÎlthout fruit'; Ono:rï 'raw smeU',
i~noxpa 'without raw smeU'; andïkï:rï 'tail', anáikixpa 'without a tail';
 yatjsikï:rï 'depth', iyatjsikïxpa 'shaUow'.
    Rï remains in a:rï 'foliage', a:rïxpa 'bare, of tree'; ta:rï 'contents',
 ita:rïxpa 'without contents'; ïxka:rï 'anything living in the water',
ixka:rixpa 'without living inhabitants'; emïirï 'daugter', emïirïxpa
 'without a daughter'.
    Ti is lost in epe:tï 'price, payment', epe~ma 'cheap'; i:pofi 'hair (on
 the body)', i:poxpa 'hairIess'; tlxse:tï 'hair (on the head)', tlxsexpa
 'baId'.
    Ti remains in e:tï 'name', etïxpa 'nameIess'; o:fi 'thing', o:tïxpa
'without thing, without substanee' ; pe:tï 'thigh', ipe:FOma 'without a
thigh'; yaxtï 'firewood', iyaxtï~ma 'without firewood'; ïxkaitï 'dysen-
tery', ixkaitïxpa 'not suffering from dysentery'; epi:tï 'medicine',
epi:tï~ma 'without medicine'.
    FinaIly, something must he said about the nouns that are regarded
as bases for the formations described here. In generaI it may he
stated that the monomorphematic nouns serve as such, but a further
specification must he given for those nouns in which the syntactic
dist'inction discussoo in 3.2.1. is partly expressed by means of vowel-
alternation. Where this is the case, the same vowel appea.rs in the
negative formations as in the syntactic B-category. In the first place
this applies to the words with 0 I e-alternation; e.g.
A o:ma, B e:marï 'path', e:maxpa 'without apath'; furthermore to
the isolated case with ale: A are:pa, B ere:parï 'cassava-bread',
ere:pûma 'without cassava-bread'. lol aIso appIies, however, to the
two irregular cases with olï-altemation at the end of the word: A auxto,
B auxti 'house', aum~ma 'without a house'; A pa:to, B pa:tï 'place,
spot', ipa:tï~ma 'without a place, spot'.
    The meaning of the memhers of the category may he described as
'without that which is designated by the corresponding monomorphem-
atic noun'.","[245, 246, 247]"

I) Composition.
  Only one case is known to me, rexta:ka '(descending) on the ridge'.
The components are re:tï 'ridge (of roof)' and ta:ka 'into', a member

syIlable by x, as in re:tï, is also found in other cases of the formation
of compounds. 120
                                3.4.    ADJECTIVES
3.4.0.  1NTRODUCT10N
   The adjectives constitute a small class: my mart:erial col1Jtains not
more than 43 monomorphematic words belonging to the system to be
discussed here.
   The categories of which the adjectives form part are all found in
other word classes as weIl, but there they belong to other, more
extensive systems. 1t is for this reason that the adjectives are treated
as a separate class. 121
   The foIlowing categories are to he dealt with:
1. The monomorphematic category.
2. The no-category (postpositions 3.3.4., verbs 3.1.3.2.13., nouns
3.2.2.5.).
3. The plural category (postpositions 3.3.5., verbs 3.1.3.2.9., nouns
3.2.2.4.).
4. The mbo-category           (postpositions 3.3.6., verbs 3.1.3.2.2., noun!>
3.2.2.2.).
   Further categories, formed by combination of the three processes
(-no, plural and -mbo) are discussed in a final section.

"2.5.3.        ACCENT IN CERTAlN TYPES OF SENTENCE    In a number of cases 47 the accent was found on the last vowel of
words which normally, in accordance with the mIe formulated in 2.5.1.,
 beJJr the accent on avowel other than the last.
   It is almost certain that this different position of the accent is
related to phenomena which belong to the larger units, word-group and
sentence. As, however, my investigation hardly concemed itself with
these Iarger units, it is not possible for me to ascertain whether this
shift of accent is subject to an absolute mIe, in the sense that the shift
invariably occurs in ce11tain types of sentence.
   I only found that all the sentences in my material in which the shift
of accent occurs clearly agree in one respect: they are all characterized47    27 cases with two long vowels, diphthongs or VCC-sequences, 6 cases with
      three such segments and 1 case with four such segments.
                  THE STRUCTURE OF THE WORn FORMS                            103by a strong melodie rise on or towards the final vowel with the deviating
accent, a rise that seems to indicate a certain incompleteness. In most
cases this indication of incompleteness is as it were a prelude to a
supplementation by a wDrd-group or word in the same sentence; in
other cases such a supplementatiDn is lacking. We shall now consider
some sentences of both these types.481) Supplementation in the same sentence.
    We find two word-groups, either pla.ced beside each Dther in an
enumeration, or connected with each Dther in a syntactic construction.
In bath cases we perceive by the melodic rise, which occurs in the
finrt group,49 thatt the rest Df the sentence will provide an addition Dr
a supplementation.
    Between the tWD word-groups I generaUy perceived (in 21 out of
the 26 cases) a c1ear pause, here indicated by /. E.g. apo:rï ïmboka:tóij
/ isei:rï ïmboká:toij 'they untied her arms / they untied her legs'
 (ïmboka:to~ 'they untied').","[122, 123]"
"8   The plural is also found in 1, both the plural and -mbo are also found in 3
    and 4. In these classes, however, they require combination with certain other
    morphological processes, whose occurrence does not depend on that of the
    plural process or the mbo-process.
110                             TUE CARIB LANGUAGE
   The diagram shows two other regular possibilities of transposition
by means of affixes, both from noons to verbs and adjectives, respec-
tively. Examples:
(2) epi:tï medicine -+ (1) epi:nopï           to treat with a medici ne
                          -+   (4) topi:ne    with currutive power.
    At the end of this survey of the interrelations hetween the word
classes it should he 110ted that no account has been taken a) of cate-
gories of limitted size, i.e. categories that show correlates with only
a small numher of memhers of the other categories helonging to the
same class, and b) of categories which, though occurring in a certain
class, are not in direct correlation with the monomorphematic category.
Without these restrictions a slightly different picture would have
emerged. In a few cases a delimitation would have been brought out
more clearly: thus there is a category of direction with -naka which
is only found with some of the postpositions (class 3) and the adjectives
 (class 4), and a caltegory of extent with -ro which is only found with
some postpositions (class 3). As against this, however, it may he said
that the picture of inner coherence would have tended to emerge even
more clearly. It will frequently be found, for instance, that categories
which are productive in one word class also occur in another word
class, but then only in a few isolated cases. Furthermore, the no- and
especially the plural- and the mbo-categories occur in practically all
classes when the restriction of b) above is not made.
   Finally it should he noted that the demonstratives and the numerals
are so-called closed classes, i.e. they show a closed system of formal-
semantic relations and consequently cannot freely take in new elements. 9
The posltpositions and adjectives, although not closed in this sen se,
nevertheless comprise a relatively small numher of words: in each of
these two classes not more than a few dozen mono-morphematic words
were found. The verbal class far exceeds all the other classes in the
number of its categories. 10

10   A nwnber of words does not belong to any of the morphological systems, and
     will therefore not he discussed here. Further research doubtless will show
     that sernantically and syntactically they belong still to a nwnber of different
     types. In the word index these words without morphological valenee are
     marked with a (P). Apart from proper names and interjections, there are
     e.g. words Iike na'nelj 'first', ro 'indeed', ko:ro 'please', ko 'interrogative
     particIe'.

 will become sufficiently clear that not in all verbs exactly the same
 morphological correlations are found. One group of verbs, which we
 shall call intransitive, generally shows a smaller number of correlations
than the other, transitive, verbs. Conversely, the latter lack a corre1ati011
 which some of the intransitive verbs have.
   The following subjeots will be disCtlssed, in this order:
3.1.1. The monomorphematic category.
3.1.2. Syntactic categories, comprising verbs that are semantically
complete1y idenotical with the corresponding m011omorphematic verbs,
thus, apart from their form, differing from these 0111y in syntactic
valence.
3.1.3. Polymorphematic categories, comprising verbs that both formally
3Ind semantically differ from the corresponding monomorphematic verbs.
3.1.4. The defective verb wa 'I am'.
   As 3.1.3. is by far the longest section and forms the nucleus of the
present chapter, a survey of its contents and arrangement will he given
in what follows. Part of the polymorphematic categories may be
described as the product of the applicati011 of a certain process to the
monomorphematic verbs or, if certain processes cannot he directly
applied to these, to polymorphematic verbs, but only to those of the
simplest possible morphological structure. The total number of cate-
gories, however, is many times larger than the tota! number of processes,
owing to the fact that it is possible to combine the latter (as in booklet,
books, booklets, where two processes yield three categories ). N ow the
division of 3.1.3. into nine sub-sections aims at giving the clearest
possible picture of this co m bin a t ion of the various processes:
1) categories formed by processes which can occur in combinati011 with
others without any restriction,
2, 3, 4) three groups of categories formed by processes each of which
eau or must occur in combinati011 with its own set of personal prefixes,
5,6, 7) categories formed by processes which cannot occur in com-
bination with personal processes,
8) a caJtegory formed by a process of transpositi011, i.e. a process
which can occur in combination with processes belO11ging to a system
other than the verbal one,

 9) categories fonned by combination of processes discussed in 1, with
 those discussed in 2-8.
    I now give a survey of the contents of the first eight sub-sections
 of 3.1.3. The processes are designated by means of one of their affix-
 alternants or other forma! modifications. A provisional indieation of
 their semantic value is added.
 1. On the basis of monomorphematic verbs the following affixations
may occur, either in combination or not in combination with all the
other verbal processes.

   -kepï non-continuation

   Affixation with we- is confined to the transitive verbs, thart: with
wos- to transitive verbs, the monomorphematic base beginning with e
or e:. The result is verbs with the same morphologica1 possibili-ties as
monomorphematic intransitive verbs. All the affixations mentioned
here may also occur in combination with each other, but 'We- eannot

"3.4.2. THE no-CATEGORY
  The formation of the members of this category takes place by:
1) suffixation with -no
2) suffixation with -'3, 3i11d change of the preceding vowel
3) removal of the final syllable.
  It was not found possible in all cases, on the basis of the structure
of the monomorphematic words, to predict the form of the word in
the no-category, or vice versa. It is possible, however, to formulate
some rules:
A) If the monomorphemart:ic word ends in 0, suffixing WÏith -no always
takes place. Twelve cases are known to me:
embo / embo:no           past, on the other side/a past one, one from
                         the other si de
ka:wo/ka:wono            high/a high one
koro:mQ/koro:mono        recent/a recent thing
kowa:ro/kowa:rono        very small/a very small one
kura:ndo/kurandono       outside/one who is outside
ma:po/ma:pono            ashore/one who is ashore
mondo/mondo:no           present/one who is present
no:mo/no:mono            menstruating/ one who menstruates
nu:ro/nu:rono            living/a living one
PoxPo/poxpo:no           low/a low one
tuwa:ro/tuwa:rono        thoughtful/a thoughtful one
tuwo:ro/tttwo:rono       different/one who is different
B) Of the two cases ending in a, one is formed according to 1), the
other according to 2):
tuwo·:muxka/tuwo:muxka:no skilful, h3i11dy/a skilful, handy one
yu~pa/yu~p""irj             good/a good one
C) With words ending in e there are the following possibilities:
a) In the following twelve cases suffixing with ~ and replacement of
e by a takes place:
pïime/ pïi~,
aPiime/ apïimat}       many, much/a manifold one
ipi:piye / ipi:piyafj  thin/a thin one
                                 MORPHOLOGY                                 261itïhnelitïhnat}           silent/a silent one

sa:meI sa:1natJ           extinguished quickly lone that is extinguished
                          quickly
sawo:nelsawo:nafj         light (of weight)/a light one
tïpïime;ltïpïimafj        thick/a thick one
b) In three cases there is suffixing with -no; in one of these -no
replaces the final syllable me:
ffi:cse I tïxse:no        far/a far one
sCfjge I sCfjge:no        near/a near one
kopo:seme I kopo:seno 122 on the opposite side/one on the opposite side
c) In the other fourteen cases ending in e, which are all formally
characterized by the fact that the final e is preceded by m,123 the no-
category is fom1ed by means of reduction. It consists in loss of the
final syllable me, except in one case, ya~wa:me 'bad', where the final
syllable is replaced by t}.
api:pime I api:pi       shallow / a shallow one
ara:suka:me I ara:su ka soft I a soft one
ase:rïme I ase:rï       newI a new one
awo :pame I awo :pa     on the edge/one that is on the edge
imbo:melimbo            fed up with/one who is fed up with
imembome 124limembo,
imemboko:me I !:memboko smail/a small one
mïno:tomeI mïno :to     pregnant/a pregnant one
122 By the side of kopo:seme and kopo:seno there is kopo:se 'opposite side',
    which with regard to its syntactic valenee is reminiscent of a noun (e.g.
    kopo:se :ne tïxse maij 'the opposite side is really far away', kopo:se wïino
    'from the opposite side'). Morphologically, however, kopo:se lacks all the
    possibilities of the nouns, whereas kopo: seme and kopo: seno c1early beloog
    to the system discussed here.
123 Jt does not, however, comprise all adjectives in me, as is c1ear from the
    foregoing discussion.
124 I have not been able to find any semantic difference between this word and
    the next one. The second is possibly more expressive: it also has a sound-
    symbolic counterpart imimbiki :me 'tiny', which imembome seems to lack.

ya~wa:me ya~wat}               bad/a bad one    That in these 14 word-pairs the longer correlate is morphologically
 less complex than the shorter one follows from their semantic parallel-
 ism with the cases listed under A, B, C. a and b above, where it
 was the shorter foml that was regarded as the less complex one.
    Furthermore, to all the words of the type api:pime rule 2 cao also
 be applied, in which case, however, final e before -13 is replaced by i,
 not by a, as in the type apïimeI apïitnOftJ. Thus we find side by side
 with the same meaning, api:pi and api:pimi13 'a shallow one', po:to and
 po:tomï13 'a large one', etc.
    The short form (po:to) and the long one (pO:tomi13) are freely
 interchangeable in all syntactie contexts, except in direct coo-
nection with a noun, where the form with mï13 is exc1uded. Thus we
find without any semantic difference po:to am se wa or po:tomÏfJ am
se wa 'I want a large one' (am 'a', se wa 'I want'), whereas in mo:ro
po:to ma:riya:rï tuta:se ma1j 'my big knife is lost' (mo:ro ma:riya:ri
'my knife'), po:to cannot he replaced by po:tmnï13.
   The meaning of the members of the no-category may be defined as
'person or thing possessing the quality designated by the corresponding
monomorphematic adjective'. Cf., e.g., the meanings of ka:wo and
ka:wono in ka:wo ma:mïi 'you have built it high', mo:ro ka:wono
sa:mii 'I have built the high one' (mo:ro 'the', a:mi 'to build'), ka:wono
am sa:mïi 'I have built a high one' (am 'a'; the reference is to houses).","[280, 281, 282]"

 (left) and the members of the no-category (right), it is difficult to
 ascertain whether i- -rï are used here in combination with the no-
 process, or not:
 pato~ne j pato~na'Yj    transverseja transverse one
 sawo:ne j sawo:nl113    light (of weight)ja light one
 opo:tome j opo:to       large j a large one
   From a semantic point of view the second possibility is the more
plausible one; it accords well with the occurrence of a instead of e
in the first two cases and .the absence of me in the third case. The loss
of 'Yj, however, is left unexplained.
D) The category with -xpa.
  The following six negative formations formed, just as in the case of
nouns, with i- -xpa, i- -~ma, -xpa or -~11ta (3.2.2.3.) confront us with
the same problem as the personal words discussed above (C).
isa:wo:naxpa not light

emï:yûma     not young, beautiful
ipoito~111a  not young, beatlltiful

129 Vowel-alternation of 0/ e in initial position also occurs in nouns; e.g. 0 :ma
    'path', e :maxpa 'without apath'.
130 As omuxka does not exist as a word and tuwo:mllxka does not appear to
    have any semantic feature that can be specially correlatoo with fIlW-, the
    word must be regarded as being monomorphematic. Strangely enough, it
    behaves as if tllW- was a prefix, for this fragment is lost when -xpa is
    affixed; while morcover tuwo :ul1Ixlw has a structure which is only found
    in polymorphematic words (2.2.2.1.): .t' follows avowel other than the first
    or scconc!, anc! it can alternate with length (tll7C!o:lIw:ka occurs too).

cases is supported by the occurrence of a instead of e in the first case,
and the absence of me in the next th ree. However, the last two cases,
without -no· in the negative fonn, seem to point in the opposite
direction.
E) Transposition to the verbs.

"A) Polymorphematic words containing 2 vowels.
A.I) Only suffixes.
   The mIe according to which bivocalic words have the vocalic struc-
ture + - also applies, without any limitation, to the polymorphematic
words. This implies that the short vowel of a base with one vowel, in
suffixing is always lengthened. E.g. on the basis of fa 'in', with -no,
ta:no 'contents'; on the basis of 'Wo 'to beat', with -yaij, wo:yaij 'he
beats him'.
A.2) Only prefixes.
  phematic nouns. This process has not any semantic consequence (kuri:yara
  = ku:riJ'a:rarï 'canoe'), its function being purely syntactical (3.2.1.).
  Personal prefixing in nouns is not applied to the monomorphematic forms,
  but to thc members of this syntactical rï-category; e.g. kuri::yara 'canoe',
  aku:riya:rarï 'your canoe'. As both the process of the Ist person and that
  of the 3rd person have a zero alternant, nouns with -rï permit a personal as
  weil as a non-personal interpretation, e.g. ku:riJ'a:rarï both 'canoe' and 'my
  canoe', e :marï both 'path' and 'hls path' (3.2.2.1.).
76                          THE CARIB LANGUAGE
   When a prefix is added to a base with one vowel, the rule aeeording
to whieh bivocaIic words have a vocalie structure + - implies the
occurrenee of an alternant with a long vowel. E.g. on the basis of ta
'in', with i:-, i:ta 'in it' (but on the basis of po:ko 'with', with i-, ipo:ko
'with it') ; on the basis of wo 'to beat', with tï:-, tï:wo 'beaten' (but on
the basis of pi:na 'to take', with tï-.. tïpi:na 'taken').
 B) Polymorphematie words with three vowels.
 B.l) Only suffixes.
    Words fomled from bases with one vowel, by means of suffixes
 with two vowels, have a vocalie structure with a long first vowel and
 a short second one. E.g. on the basis of kï 'to rasp', kï:potï 'to rasp
 repeatedly'; on the basis of wo 'to beat', 'wo:kepï 'to stop heating'.
    The words with three vowels formed hy suffixing of a bivocalic
base may, in aecordanee with the table on p. 72, have one of two types
of vocalie structure, viz. - + - or + - -. In eertain bases the first
vowel is shortened and the seeond is lengthened when a suffix is added,
whereas in other bases both vowels retain their original length. E.g. on
the basis of O:1na 'path', o:makoij 'paths', e:marï '(his) path'; 15 but
on the baJSis of o:wa 'hammock-line', owa:koij 'hammock-lines', ewa:rï
'(his) hammock-line'.
   It is impossible to predict in all cases whether the type + - - or
the type - + - will result. It is eertain that retention of the original
length of the two vowels is found in all bases with an initial consonant.
E.g. on the basis of pi:ra 'sail', pi:rakoiJ 'sails'. This rule also holds
good when a polymorphematic word with two vowels serves again
as a base; e.g. on the basis of po 'at', po:no 'one who is at', po:nokoiJ
'id. plural'.
   On the other hand, of bases with an initial vowel some have quan-
titative modification, some not. No mIe could he found: the phonemie
structure of the base has nothing to do with it, while the following
cases show that it also does not matter whether the base is a noun,
a verb, or a demonstrative.o:mG paJt:h                     e:marï     (his) path

i:ro   this (anaphoric)           iro:koij     these (anaphoric)   Finally it should be pointed out that there is no question of the
vocalic structure + - - being rare in words of this type, as was the
case in monomorphematic words: it results from the suffixing of all
bivocalic bases with initial consonant, and besides of part of the bases
with initial vowel.
B.2) Only prefixes.
    Generally the vocalic structure - + - is found, viz. in all cases
where the base contains two vowels. E.g. on the basis of a:ro 'to take
along', with ay-, aya:ro 'to take you'; on the basis of ku:po 'on', with
i-, iku:po 'on it'.
   The vocalic structure + - - was only fOUlld in formations from
bases which already had this structure themselves. To this category
belong a few words with initial ï:, which vowel is dropped when a
prefix is added; e.g. on the basis of ï:potï 'hair of the body', with the
long prefix-alternant i:-, i:potï 'the hair of his body', cf. on the basis
of sa:no', with the short prefix-alternant i-, isa:no 'his mother'.
B.3) Both prefixes and suffix es.
    In general we find a vocalic structure with a short first vowel and a
long second one. E.g. on the basis of la 'in', with i- and -no, ita:no
'its contents'; on the basis of wo 'to beat', with si- and -ya, siwo:ya
'I beat him'.
   The other vocalic structure, with a long first vowel and a short
second one, is found in formations of the following two types.
   In the first place in formations from the bases with initial ï:, men-
tioned in the preceding section; e.g. on the basis of ï:potï 'hair of the
body', by affixing with i:- and -ta and loss of the fragments ï: and ti,
i:pota 'to become hairy'.t 7

        2.5.1.   RULES OF ACCENTVATION
           The accent is a prominence which - it seems to me - is effected
        in the first pla.oe, if not solely, by pitch variations. 42
           Accentuation in Carib is regular. The position of the accent mainly
        depends on the number of long vowels, diphthongs and VCC-sequences
        occurring in the word. From an accentual point of view there is a
        clear equivalence among these three.
        1) If in a given word onIy one long vowel, diphthung or VCC-sequence
        occurs, then the accent always falls on the last vowel.
          In the available material the following types are represented:        L         o:ró              tOllo:ró                    si:také           kure:wakó

        tion of the accent: po~gó, itauxtî,42° samïixtaké.
        2) If two long vowels, diphthongs, or VCC-sequences occur in a word,
        the accent always falls on the second of these segmeI1l1:s.

                     THE STRUCTURE OF THE WORD FORMS                          97    The available material does not allow us in all cases to st3l1:e with
 certainty in how far the open spaces in the table are due to gaps in
 the material, or reflect certain structure rules. The latter is certainly
 the case in most of the open spaces in the fifth and the sixth column,
 which show the second, accented, segment in final position. All com-
 binations with a long vowel or VCC-sequence for their second segment
 are excluded here, since these segments cannot occur finally.43
    When a diphthong stands immediately before a CC-sequence, such
a segment (diphthong-consonant-consonant) is again coUl1ll:ed as one.
E.g.: kuixkasé:re, auxtá:rï, kïteixtá:toiJ, auxtómbo, amïixpómbo, kïna:-
mïixtafj.
    In three cases I noticed a second accent, besides the accent according
to the rule: ini:pá:torîkofj, aye:Pá:nopïrï, mitu:wá:romatáke. The fact
th311: the accented vowel is followed by a fairly large number of vowels
 (3, resp. 4) will have played a part in these cases.
   These three words also occur, however, without the second accent,
without there being any difference in meaning.
    No difference in degree between the two prominences was noticed
by me.
3) If three long vowels, diphthongs, or VCC-sequences occur in a word,
the second long vowel, diphthong or VCC-sequence bears the accent in
185 out of the 228 cases in my material.
   If the available material is arranged according to type, the situation
is as follows: 44
43   See 2.1.2.1.2. and 2.1.2.2.3.

     only D L L has been included in the tabie, this being the only combination
     that was found (in kinaipa:sa:tO'ij).

         to indicate the number of cases of each type. The material appears to
         be predominantly concentrated in a few types: more than 2/3 beloog
         to the types with a LLL, LLCC or LCCL structure. Of most types
         onIy a few cases, or sometimes only one case, have been found. In the
         latter case no figure has been added.
            The large number of open spaces shows that often not a single case
         was found. I find it impossible to say in which cases this is due to
         a shortage of material and in which cases it may reflect a morphono-
         logical rule.
            Let us now consider the 43 cases in which the accetlJl: was not found
         on the serond long vowel, diphthong or VCC-sequence. In these cases
         the third segment tums out to be the bearer of the accent.
            The available materiaI, arranged according to type, is set out in the
         table below. 45         448 î    = accentuated i.
            45   As not one case was found, the table does not take into account the 9 con-
                 ceivable combinations with D as the first of the three segments.

            We found that in words containing one long vowel, diphthong or
         VCC-sequence a simple rule applied: the accent always falls on the
         last vowel. The same is true of words containing two of these segments:
         in these words the accent always falls on the second segment.
            A complicalted situation was found to exist, however, in words that
         contain more than two of these segments. It is true that in these
         words, too, the accent was usually found to fall on the second segment,
         bUIt accent on the third segment was also found to occur, and even
         - although only in a few cases - accent on the fourth segment.
            We must now ask ourselves how this situation is to he accounted
         for. There are three possibilities.
         a) All cases, both those with the accent on the second and those with
         the accent on the third or fourth segment, are subject to a set of rules
         applying to all of them, so that certain types have one accentual pattern
         and other types another.
         b) The rule is that the accent falls on the second segment; the 50
         cases in which this is not the case form an exception to the rule. It
         will then he necessary 11:0 see whether this exceptional position can he
         accounted for.
         c) Only in words COIlItaining more than two segments the accent cao
         fall either on the second, or on the third, or on the fourth segment.
            Comparison of the tables in 3) and 4) shows that the first of these
         three alternatives cao be rejected. In 3) we find no less than 14 types
         that have the accent both on the second and on the third segment.
         Besides, among these 14 types there happen to be the most frequent
         ones: out of the total numher of 228 cases no fewer than 178 belong
         to a type in which both accentual patterns were found.
                     THE STRUCTURE OF THE WORD FORMS                        101     The same is tme of 4) : 20 of the 26 cases beloog to a type in
 which accent of the second, as weIl as of the third and fourth segment
 was found.
    The second possibility cannot be excluded. However, the nurnher of
 exceptions to the mIe is on the high side : 43 out of a total of 228
cases with three segments, and 7 out of a tota! of 26 with four segments.
 Moreover none of them have special features of any kind to account
for their supposedly exceptional character.
     FinaIly, the third altemative is supported by the fact that a numher
of doublets were found: kïne:pori:toma:no and kïne:pori:tomá:no,
kïni:tt'tnda:no and kïni:tundá:no, kïni:tunda:tdfJ and kïni:tundá:toij,
 kïno:tánáOmoyafJ and kïno:tandî~moya1j. It is true that the number
of these doublets is smaIl, but this might be explained by the way in
which the data were coIlected: they were taken from a limited text-
material, in which a:lmost every word occurred once or alt the most a
 few times. In this connexion it is perhaps significant that in kïni:-
 tllnda:no 'he arrived' and kïni:tunda:toij 'they arrived', words which
occur mther frequently in stories, bath accentual pattems were found.
    The supposed freedom of position does not exclude a preference
for one of the segments. Such a preferenee would then be reflected in
the strong predominance of cases with the accent on the second
segment.46
    We now arrive at our final conclusion. If we choose the last of
the three alternatives (a free accent in words with 3 or 4 segnlents)
as heing the most plausible, it becomes possible to formulate a generaIly
valid accentual mIe.
    It mns as foIlows: in each word the accent faIls on a long vowel,
diphthong or VCC-sequence, but never on the first segment of this
type that occurs in the word. This mIe applies to words with one
segnlent, as weIl as to those with two, three or four segments:
    in words cO\1ltaining only one long vowel, diphthong or VCC-
sequence and therefore lacking a segnlent of this kind to bear the
accent in accordance with the mIe, the final vowel bears the accent;
    in words containing a second segment the accent always faIls on
this segn1ent;
46   They constitute 81 % of the tota! number of cases. This preference for the
     second segment is possibly less strong in words in which three segments
     follow each other immediately without being interrupted by a short vowel
     (in the tab!es: the third and fourth columns). In these words the second
     segment is accented in almost 75 % of the cases, while for the words in the
     first two columns the percentage is almost 90 %.

"2.1.2.1. CONSONANTS
2.1.2.1.1.   I nitial and medial position
   Initially all consonantSJ were found except 1j, '3 and g; x and ,
however only in 'wa/:wa 'to, by', 'me/:me 'small' (already discussed
in 2.1.1.4.3B.) and in the enclitics xkuru/ :kuru 'al ready' and 'ne/:ne
'really, the true one' (2.3.).
   These are also the only foor cases with a cluster in initial position.
   The other consonants are found, for instance, in the following words:
pa:na 'ear', tunda 'to arrive', ka:pu 'heaven', batjga 'man's name',
                    THE STRUCTURE OF THE WORD FORMS                        69 diye:mo 'woman's name', mo:ro 'that', no:kï 'who', wïino 'away from,
from', yu:po 'sweet cassava', sa:kau 'sand', re:re 'bat'.
    Medially, all consonants occur except 1), 13, g, x and ~, as weIl as all
 the consonant clusters al ready mentioned. Examples: ra:pa 'again',
 pa:to 'place', po:ko 'with', itu:bïrï 'old woman', wo:di 'girl', o:ma 'path',
o:nu 'eye', ma:wi 'species of fish', o:ya 'where to', ku:sa 'crab', no:ro
'still'. For examples wi-th clusters see 2.1.1.1.1.
    The fact that g is not found initially and medially is perhaps to be
accounted for in not quite the same way as the non-occurrence of 1],
'3, x and ~. It is possible to regard the non-occurrence of g in these
positions as being part of the more general fact toot voiced stops are
extremdy rare initially and medially: band d were also found in some
very few cases (see 1.1.2.1.). It is therefore not impossible that further
investigation may proouce some instances of g in these two positions,
which seems hardly likely in the case of the four other consonants
(1), 13, x and n.
2.1.2.1.2.   Pinal position    In this position only 1), 13 are found; and very rarely m, and the
cluster ~m.
   Examples: aura1) 'language', e:ra'3 'guard'.
   Only one case was found of both m and ~m in final position: am
'somebody, something, a little', ro~m 'otherwise, else'.
   By the side of am, a:lnu occurs. It would seem plausible enough to
assume that am, with its exceptional fina,1 -111, is a reduced form used
in rapid speech. Yet this is not the case. In the case of ro~m, which
is doubly exceptional because it does not only end in m but is moreover
the only instance of a sequence of two consonants in final position, we
find a situation similar to that of a11l. By the side of ro~m the forms
ro:mu1) and ro~mu1) occur with a meaning which does not seem to he
different from that of the shorter fonn. Again, ro~m is by no means
confined to rapid speech.
   When through suffixing 1] and 13 lose their final position, the follow-
ing phenomena occur:
   If the suffix has an initial consonant the result is different clusters
which can also occur in monomorphematic words: mb, nd (2.1.1.l.1Bl)
or ~m (2.1.1.1.1B2, the type wo:toxko~me).
   1f the suffix has an initial vowel, 1) and 13 are replaced by n. E.g.
on the basis of aura1) 'language, speech', with -ïmbo, auranïmbo 'chat-
 70                        THE CARIB LANGUAGE
ting'; on the basis of wo:nel1j 'murderer' (which is fonned on the basis
of wo' 'to kill'), with -ïmbo, wo:nenïmbo 'mean murderer'.
   Finally a remark about the frequency of finalfj and '3. It is strikingly
low in mooomorphemaJtic words: there are only 39 instances of fj in
my material, and even fewer instanees of '3 : S. On the other hand,
in polymorphematic words the frequency of fj and '3 is by no means
low, because a fairly large number of productive suffixes happen to
end in these consonants (see phonemics, 1.1.2.2.).
2.1.2.1.3.   Position after first and second vowel
   In monomorphematic words clusters containing x or ~ are only
found either after the first vowel or after the second. E.g. moxka:ro
'they', upi~no 'under'. A structure with such a cluster after, for in-
stance, the fouM vowel, as in anu:ku:tïxpa 'not knowing' (uku:tï 'to
know', with an- and -xpa) can only occur in a polymorphematic wOord.
The same is true fOor a structure with such clusters both after the first
and after the secOond VOowe1: e.g. u.rta~nofj 'things that do not emerge'
(uxta 'emerge' with -~nofj) ; see 2.2.2.1.
2.1.2.2. VOWELS
2.1.2.2.1. Initial position
   In this positioo all vowels were fOound except ei and ui, while oi
was not found in monOomOorphematic wOords, but only in some poly-
morphematic words. In view Oof the generally low frequency of diph-
thongs, the chances. are that in this case ther~ is an accidental gap in
the material. Examples of vowels in initial position: a:ko 'mortar' ,
e:ro 'this', o:ko '.two', i:tu 'forest', tt:na 'to wipe off', ï:rï 'to give',
aku:pa 'species of fish', eka:numï 'to run', okoipo 'species of tree',
ine:ku 'poisonous liana used for fishing', uwembo 'belly', ïra:pa 'bow',
auxto 'house', aima 'to smoke', ïiyo 'husband', o'iyo 'your husband'
(with replacement of ïi by oi).
2.1.2.2.2.   Medial position
   All vowels occur in this positioo, except between the penultimate
and the final consonant where only short vowels can occur.
Examples: kuma:ka 'cotton-silk tree', ame:kufj 'wrist', amo:ro 'you,
thou (sg)', kupi:ra 'species of fish', ma.su:wa 'fish-trap', wokï:rï 'man',
ame~tarï 'geogr. name', pere:pete:ri 'omanlent, wing-case of beetle',

mïkafj 'trough', itauxtï 'rapid (noun)', amo:saikï 'claw', oseiri 'new',
okoipo 'species of tree'. apu:kuita 'paddIe', ekïini 'smoke'.

   All vowels occur in this position except tbe long ones.
Examples: u:pa 'to distribute, hand out', o:we 'where', si:mo 'liana',
u:pi ""to look for', ore:ku 'war', amo:fi 'strap, sling', sa:kau 'sand',
to:kai 'hut', wa:sei 'species of palm', o:roi 'cashew', ï:rui 'older brother',
ta:pii 'men's house'.
2.1.2.2.4. Final and penultima te position
   An immediate sequence of vowels is generally not confined to a
certain position. We found aembo 'ready', masi:ïri:rï 'species of insect',
miro:kou 'species of fish'. There are indications, however, that sequen-
ces of two vowels which can occur together as components of a diph-
tbong are confined to the end of tbe word. These are the sequences:
a:u, a:i, e:i, ei, o:i, u:i and ï:i,12 as found in wana:u 'otter', mara:i
'wood-hen', we:i 'to become', ake:rei 'species of bird', ï,xtupo:i 'to sit
down on something', pu:i 'to extend', sikï:i 'little finger'.
   One of tbe 26 monomorphematic cases, however, pïya:usi 'osprey'
is apparently not subject to tbe supposed rule. This might he reason
enough to give up the idea of regularity, but for the fact that when
words ending in a:i, etc. are suffixed a modification occurs which also
points to these vowel sequences heing confined to final position. In
suffixing the sequence of vowels is replaced by the corresponding
diphthong: e.g. on the basis of we:i 'to become', with -ya, weiya 'I
become' is formed, on the basis of apo:i 'to seize', a.poiko 'seize him';
with diphthongs ei, oi. Our conclusion therefore, although with some
hesitation, is that the rule according to which o:i, etc. are confined to
word-final position is valid, and that pïya:usi shows an exceptional
structure.","[88, 89, 90, 91]"
"3.5.2.3. THE ne-CATEGORY
   The name 'ne-category' for the plural has heen retained here for
the sake of uniformity. It is not meant to indicate that the alternant
-ne plays any part here in the fonnation of plurals.
   In the same way as practically all nouns, the demonstratives referring
to inanimate objects have a plural fonned by means of the suffix -koij;
e.g. e:roko1j 'these', iro:koij 'those just mentioned'.
   The plural of demonstratives referring to living ereatures, with the
exeeption of au 'I', is fonned by suffixing with either -aij (also found
with a few nouns) or -aro; combined with modification of the base.
  The suffix i'S -aij in the following three cases:
no:kï    who                         nort""kaij   who, plural
mo:kï    that                        1nOrt""kaij  those
mo:se    this                        mo:yaij     these
  The suffix is -aro in the following four cases:
mort""ko  he                          mort""ka:ro they
kïxko    both of us                  kirt""ka:ro  we, including hearer
amo:ro you                           amïiyaro you, plural
ino:ro   the one just mentioned ina:ro           those just mentioned
   An isolated position is taken up by au 'I', which has for its plural
a~na 'we, excluding hearer'. It is to he noted that au takes up a similar
isolated position in the system of formal-semantic relationships dis-
cussed in 3.5.1.
   The plurals mort""ka:ro and nort""ka1j can OOth he further suffixed with
the ordinary plural suffix -koij. M o.rka:rokoij is used to refer respect-
fully to a third person (father, mother, wife's brother) ,139 while
noxkatjgo1j occurs as a plural of the taboo-word no.rkaij 'snake', which
to the speakers is probably identical with nort""kaij 'certain creail:ures'.",[297]
"2.1.3.1. VOCALIC STRUCTURE OF WORDS WITHOUT
       CLUSTER AND WITHOUT DIPHTHONG
   In these words the distribution of long and short vowels corresponds
to one of the following patterns (+ long, - short vowel).
 Total number of vowels         First vowel short     First vowel long           1
           2                                        +-

           7                 -+-+---or +-+----
  The table shows that words eontaining three or more vowels may
have two types of vocalic structure, one with a short first vowel, the
other with a long one. A word containing four vowels, for instance,
                      THE STRUCTURE OF THE WORD FORMS                          73 may have either a vocalie structure like kure :wako 'green parrot' or
 one like ka:rawa:si 'rattle'.
   Where two types of vocalie structure are possible, those with a
 long first vowel are the least frequent. This is especially apparent in
 the large group of monomorphematic words with three vowels: as
against some hundreds of cases with - + -, only 15 cases were found
with + - -; to wit ï:poti 'body hair', ma:puru 'staff', ku:miri 'to be
hungry', ta:kuwa 'polishing stone', o:ruwa 'three', pa:tïmï 'nephew',
ko:koro 'early moming', e:rome 'now, today', a:sito 'a Httle', ro:rïpo
'ra,ther', i:tunt 'forest', ku:mïkalJ 'trough', slt:rabafj 'beam', yo:rokafj
'evil spirit', ka:bara 'sheep'. The not very numerous monomorphematie
cases with five vowels in my material all helOlIg to the type with a
short first vowel; because their numher is so smalI, while moreover
the type with a long first vowe\ was found in polymorphemaJtie words,
there seem to he insufficient grounds for considering the latter vocalism
impossible in monomorphematie words.
   Vocalie structures with six and seven vowe\s were only found in
polymorphematie words.

of whieh was found in one case only; - -, - + + - -, and

  The first is found in Itwa 'no', where the exceptional structure may

74                            THE CARIB LANGUAGE
exeeptiO'nal structure in this case is eertain, in view O'f the great number
O'f bivocalie words in the material.
    The second pattem is found in kuri:ta:nene 'noon, mid-night', which
may cO'ntain kuri:ta 'day' with an otherwise unknown reduplicatioo of
the encIirt:ie :ne 'rea!'.
   The third type O'f vocalic structure occurs in ika:rikana:ri 'cinnamO'n
wood', the O'nly monomorphematic WO'rd with six vowels. This pattem
corresponds to a doubling of the trivocalic pattem - + -, so that
ika:rikana:ri gives the impression of being compounded of two trivo-
calic words. Yet is it improbable that we have a compound here. as
neither ika:ri nor kana:ri occur as separate words.
   Let us O'nce more con si der the various types O'f vocalic structure
as set out in the tabIe. 1t is true for all of them that with regard to
the first twO' VO'wels only two arrangements are possible: either the
first vowel is short and the second long, or the first is long and the
second short. Further comparison shows that also the length of the
other vowels is related in a simple way to that of the first two: the
second vO'wel following the long first or second vowel is long as weIl,
provided it is not in final position or precedes a final consonant; since
according to a general mIe no long VO'wels ean occur in these positions.
We therefO're find with a long secood vowel, a long fourth VO'wel in
the pattern - + - + -; and with a long first vO'wel, a long third
one in the pall:tem -I- - -I- - ; while the second vowel follO'wing the
long O'ne is not long in the patterns -I- - - and - + - -, where it
has final position.
   The fact that the table O'n page 72 also applies to agreat many poly-
morphematic words, implies bath the occurrence of affix-alternants
which differ only as to the being either long or shO'rt of their vowels,
and the occurrence of lengthening or shortening of vowels belooging to
the base. These alternatioos and modifications are generally determined
by the following factors:
1) the vocalic structure O'f the base,
2) the number O'f vowels added, either by single or repeated prefixing,
or single or repeated suffixing,
3) the identity O'f the affixes used.
  The third factor is of less importance than ·the other two. Affixing
with the syntactical suffix -rï,14 the personal prefix y- (lst person),14   -ri, or one of its coalternants -ru, -ni and -di, are added to many lIIonomor-
                    THE STRUCTURE OF THE WORD FORMS                           75or with both together, in certain circumstances may result in a shift
of vocalic pattern, one regular pattern (short-long) being replaced by
 the other, corresponding, regular pattern (long-short). There are other
suffixes that also may modify in a special way the length of one vowel
in the base; however, this modification never leads to the emergence
of a new, still regular pattern, but always to disturbance of the
 regularity. Therefore those other suffixes will be discussed later, in 2.2.
   It would no doubt be better in our discussion to start from all the
types of vocalic structure conceivable on the basis of the combination
of the three factors mentioned above. My limited material, however,
does not admit sueh treatment. I shall therefore begin at the opposite
end and, starting from the available polymorphematic cases with a
regular vocalie structure, I shall examine what alternations and modi-
fications have occurred in their formation.
   We shall deal suceessively with polymorphematic words containing
2, 3 and 4 or more vowels. Those affixing processes which dot not
add avowel to the base need not be discussed; with the exception,
however, of prefixing with }'- which, as we have seen, may be attended
by special quantitative modifications. The words will be discussed in
this order: first those words whieh only contain sllffixes, next those
that only contain prefixes, and finaUy those that co11'tain prefixes as
weU as suffixes.","[92, 93, 94, 95]"

ona:pi olie', ona:pi:wa:no 'lies in general'.
  Cases with -wa:no, final syllable is lost:
epi:ti 'medicine' , opi:wa:no 'medicines in general' ; aki:rï 'plague, some-
thing that makes a place unsafe', akï:wa:no 'plagues in general' .
   Wilth regard to the replacement of e by 0 it should he noted that
this is not connected with the syntactic e/o-alternation discussed in
3.2.1. For vowe1-altematioo takes place not only in the words that are
suffixed with -ri and thus take part in the syntactic mechanism in
qumon, but in all nouns heginning with e or e:. E.g. e:ti 'nam.e',
unchanged in ï~muru e:tï 'my son's name', but with 0 in otï:wa:no
 'names in generai'.
  We have alreadyseen that a final syllable ti, rï may he lost before
-nana or -wa:no. In which cases this phenomenoo occurs needs further
investigatioo. One is inclined to assume that the same nouns are in-
volved which lose these syllabi es hefore negative -xpa/ -~ma; there is,
however, ooe case in my material for which this is not true: epi:fi
'medicine' retains ti in epi:ti~ma 'without me<licine', but loses ti in
opi:wa:no 'medici ne in general'.
   The meaning of the members of the category may he described as
follows: 'what is designated by the corresponding noun, in general'.
   The gen~rality referred to may be of two kinds:
I. There is not ooe concrete thing to which the noun ean refer. E.g.
nu:wa:no ene:ke maij 'it is like a tongue, it is tongue-shaped' (nu:ru
'tongue', ene:ke ma~ 'it is like'); po:rina:no ta:ro ro:te~ iya~siki:ri
'is depth was only the length of a shin' (po:riri 'shin', ta:ro 'as far
as, as long as', ro:te~ 'only'; iya1jsiki:rï 'its depth').
 11. There are concrete things to which the noun refers, but the
 numher of these things is not in any way limited or known. E.g.
 mainana:no kopo:seme ma~ 'the complex of gardens is across the river'
 (maina 'garden', kopo:seme ma~ 'is across the river') ; moxko e:tï
 anu:ku:!ixpa ma~? 'doo't you know his name?' (question put to

3.2.2.7. TRANSPOSITION TO THE VERBS
  3.2.2.7.1. Transposition to the intransitive verbs
     On the basis of monomorphematic nouns a transpositional category
  is fonned, ,the members of which hehave like monomorphematic in-
  transitive verbs. This takes place by suffixation with:
  1) -ta
 2) -na
 3) -da
 4) -wa
 5) -pami
 6) -nopami
 7) -mami
     Apart from a small number of cases, which will be enumerated later,
 the rule is that altemant 1 occurs when the noun ends in avowel, and
 altemant 2 when it ends in a nasal, which is lost when suffixation
 takes p1ace.
 Examples:
 1) iiyo 'husband', ïiyota 'to find a husband, get married' ; wa:re 'song',
 wa:reta 'to sing'.
2) po:~ 'sweetness', po:si:na 'to become sweet'.
     Contrary to the rule given above, suffixation with 2 was found in
the following nouns ending in avowel: a:ri 'foliage', a:rïna 'to bud,
get leaves'; apeinï 'ti dal current in the river', apeina 'to flow'; asi:woini
 'clarity' (water), asi:woina 'to become c1ear'; pu:nu 'flesh', pu:na '00
grow, become sturdy'; amu:nu 'whiteness', amu:na 'to become white'.
 Of these five, the first case is an isolated one, the other four agree in
having ni or nu for their final syllable. N ow it might he supposed
that there is a rule here, viz. one prescribing the second altemant also
for nouns ending in nï or nu. In two other cases it was found, however,
tha.t they are suffixed not with the second altemant but with the third,
while the final vowel ij u is lost:

4) auru 'laughter', auwa '00 laugh'; e:napo:rï 'snoring', e:napo:wa '00
snore'; mo:ri 'rumbling', mo:riu'a 'to rumble' (e.g. of a drum); sa:pi
'play, playfulness', sa:piwa 'to he playful'; to:ri 'story', to:riwa 'to tell
a story'; 106 ona:pi olie', ena:piwa 'to lie'; mo:na 'theft' , mo:nawa 'to

  side mo:nawa, as far as I could tell, with exactly the same meaning.
     The last three alternants were each found in one case:
  6) a:siiJ 'heat', a:simbamï 'to become hot'.
  7) koiye 'aftemoon, after four o'c1ock', koiyeno:pamï 'to become late
 aftemoon'.
 8) ewa:rumï 'darkness', ewa:ruma:mï 'to grow daI1k'.
     By the side of a:simbamï regular a:si:na occurs, without any ap-
 parent difference in meaning.
     Nouns in which the syntactic distinction A/B is characterised not
 only by suffixation with -ri or -rtt but also by vowel-altemation, have
 the same vowel in the transposition-category as in the B-category.
  E.g. A o:nu, B enu:ru 'eye', enu:ta 'to begin to understand'.
    As was the case with the xpa- and nano-categories (above, 3.2.2.3.,
 3.2.2.6.), suffixation may be accompanied by loss of the final syllable
 of the noun. The phenomenon was found in the following syllabies: ti,
 ki, ku, rï, ru, and - as we saw above - nï and nu; however, it does
 not occur in all words that end in one of these syllabies. Loss of the
 final syllable was found in: ka:fi 'fat', ka:ta 'to become fait', mi:tï
 'root', mi:ta 'to he rooted'; pï:tï 'wife', pï:ta 'to find a wife, get mar-
 ried'; ixkaitï 'dysentery', ixkaita 'to get dysentery'; anï:kï 'illness',
 anï:ta 'to fall ill'; asi:wokï 'satiety', asi:wota 'to become satiated';
 ora:muku 'sweat', era:muta 'to sweat'; ko:ri 'decay', ko:ta 'to decay,
 become rotten'; me:rï 'drawing, marking', me:ta 'to get marking
 (animal)' ; pïirï 'shame, shyness', pïita 'to become slIy'; ye:ri 'tooth,
sharpness', ye:ta 'to get teeth, become sharp'; akï:rï 'plague', akï:ta
 'to be visited with a plague'; ï:rki:rï 'yellowness', ïxki:ta 'to become
yellow' ; ena:rirï 'nervousness', ena:rita 'to become l1ervOUS'; ï~no':rï
'raw, polluted air', ï~no:ta 'to smell raw'; auru 'laughter', auwa 'to
laugh', aktl:ru 'soft substance', aku:ta 'to become soft'; ya:puru 'decayed
wood', ya:puta 'to moulder'. Two syllables are lost in andïkï:rï 'tail',
andï:ta 'to grow, get a tail'; 107 umï:rïkï:rï 'to curl', umï:rïta 'to become
curly'.
    As against this, there are three cases which retain ti or rï: we:tï
'rust', we:tïta 'to become rusty', a:rï 'foliage', a:rïna 'to bud'; mo:ri
'rumbling', mo:rïwa 'to rumble'.","[250, 251, 252, 253]"
"H. Combinad:ioll of the xpa-process with the mbo-, no- and plural

   By combination of -xpa with one or two of the other processes at
least foor, and probably five, categories may he fonned:                                 no-process           mbo-process

 has been left open, because I have omitted to find out wh ether it occurs.
 It seems probable that it does.
    In the combination of -xpa, -no and the plural process a special
alterna.t1it occurs, -~nofj.
    In words formed by combination of -xpa and -mbo I found -xpa both
before -mbo and after it. I do not know whether this difference in
order involves any semantic difference.
    Finally it seems possible to me that, together with -xpa, the no-
and the mbo-process may he combined, too; I have not investigated
rt:his, however.
 lIl. Combination of -nano and the plural process.
   In three cases I found generalizing -nano (3.2.2.6.) combined with
the plu ral suffix, -kofj (3.2.2.4.): maina 'garden', tnainana:noko1j
'gardens in general, and in all their diversity'; aiya:rï 'hand', aiyana:-
nokofj 'hands, of all kinds of people'; ïmba 'shoulder', ïmbana:nokofJ
'shoulders, of all kinds of people',ll3
   I have not further investigated the combination of the two processes,
but I would call attention to the possibility that they may be freely
combinable. If only from a semantic point of view (combination of
'generalizing aspect' and 'plurality'), this would be an important datum.
   Combination of -nano with personal prefixation, -xpa and -mbo may
he ruled out as impossible.
3.2.4.     THE CATEGORIES WITH -xto, mï-, -kepï, -po, as-
   These five categories have so far not been mentioned. As they occur
only a few .times in my material and as attempts to obtain more cases
failed, I suspect that these are processes which, at any rate in the
nouns, are unproductive; in the verbal system, -xto, mï- and -kepï are
definitely productive, and as- is productive with the postpositions.
   My researches on this point have not been thorough enough, however,
so that a further check will he necessary; especially with regard to
-xto and mi-.
A) The xto-category.
   I know of tnainaxto 'no garden, without garden' (tnaina), and yexto
'withourt: sharpness' (ye :rï). As with the verbs, further suffixation113   A somewhat similar 'double plurality' occurs in groups consisting of a noun
      in the plural, and a temporaljmodal verbal form, also in the plu ral (3.1.3.3.3.1.,
      at the end).
248                         THE CARIB LANGUAGE
takes place with -ri, unless me follows: mainaxto me maij 'it is not a
garden', mari:ya yextorï mo:ro wa:ra nixkoto:poi 'the blunttless of the
knife caused it to he cut like this' (mo:ro wa:ra 'like this', nixkoto:poi
'it has caused it to cu.t like this'). For -xto in the verbal sySltem, see
3.1.3.2.5.
B) The mi-category.
  In the two cases in my material, mï- is combine<! with generalizing
-nano (above, 3.2.2.6.): wo:ku 'beer', mïwo:kuna:no 'the beer of all
of us'; ï:potï 'hair on body', mï:po'lf.!a:no 'the hair on all our bodies'
For mi- in the verbal sySltem, see 3.1.3.2.12.
C) The kepï-category.
   Some nouns may be directly suffixed with the aspect-suffix -kepï
'to stop, cease', without a special transposition-suffix being necessary.
The resulting formation has all the properties of a verb. The cases in
my mart:erial are: o:nlt 'eye', enu:kepï 'to he dazzled'; are:pa 'bread',
ere:pake:pï 'to he left without any bread, to run out of bread'; auraij
'speech', aurOlY3gepï 'to stop speaking'; a:ri 'leaf', a:rif3gepï 'to he
stripped of leaves'. I cannot account for the introduction of a nasal in
this last: case. For -kePi in the verbal system, see 3.1.3.1.4.
D) The po-category.
   Suffixation with -po is combined with the syntactic process (-ri),
and may furthermore he combined with the transpositiona:l process
t- -re. I know of only the following cases: aiya:rï 'hand', A aiya:po,
B aiyapo:rï 'dexterity', taiyapo:re 'handy'; e:tï 'name, cry, sound of
musical instrument', A oti:po, B etï:pori 'beautiful sound of musical
instrument', toti:pore 'sounding beautiful'; undi 'trunk, steersman',
A unái:po, B unáiPo:rï 'skill in steering', tunáiPo:re 'skilful at steering'.
E) The as-category.
  The reciprocÏJty-prefix as- has been found with kinship-terms:
enauxfi 'sister', enaunaiJ 'sisters', ase:naunaiJ 'sisters of one another'.
For as- with postpositions, see 3.3.3.","[266, 267, 268]"
"3.3.6.   THE mbo-CATEGORY    The mbo-process can only he applied in combination with the no-
process (3.3.4.). There are two alternants:
1) -mbo
2) -imbo
    Both are placed after the suffix of the no-process. The first occurs if
the alternant of the no-process is -no, the second if it is -t3; before
-imbo this nasal is replaced by -n-.
Examples:
1) ita:no 'its contents', ita:nombo 'its former contents'.
2) epi:tï mat} 'something that serves as a medicine', epi:ti ma:nimbo
'something that cannot really serve as a medicine'.
   The meaning of the memhers of the category may he defined as
'that which is designated by the corresponding word in the no-category,
regarded by the speaker with some reserve as not or no longer agreeing
with the present state of affairs'. E.g. ita:no kina:ruta:no 'its contents
are drying', but ita:nombo kïno:ta:pika:no 'its contents were scattered',
i.e. of a basket which ripped, so that its contents feIl on the groUilld
and ,thus at the moment spoken about were no longer really in the
basket. llS117 There is no affixed form to refer to 'like us, exc1uding the hearer'. In order
    to express this, use must he made of the demonstrative a~na 'we, excl.' e.g.
    a;Jna wa:,-a 'like us, exc1.'.
118 For more information on the semantic value of -mbo sec the sections on the
    adjectives and the nouns, where the category also occurs and more data
    were available (3.4.4. and 3.2.2.2.).

        PROCESSES WITH EACH OTHER
    When we discussed the separate categories we already saw that
certain processes mus t occur in combimIltion with certain other pro-
cesses: the plural process requires either personal prefixing, or reflexive
prefixing with as-, or suffixing with -no, the mbo-process requires
suffixing with -no.
    Beside these compulsory combinations 0 p t ion a I combination is
als<> possible, namely of all prefixings (personal, and with as-) with
the no-process, and of the mbo-process with the plural process. This
means that in all 40 categories are formed, belonging to a system which
may be illustraJted by the following paradigm:                       plural            mbo-process       mbo-process and
                       process                             plural combined
          awa:ra       awa:raine
          Iike you     Iike you(plur.)
no-       awa:rano     awa:rano:koij     awa:ranombo       awa:rano: konimbo
process   one who is   those who are     one who is not    those who are not
          Iike you     Iike you          really like you   really Iike you   All the words in this paradigm share the prefix a-, for second pers011.
Since instead of this a- it is possible for 4 other personal prefixes,
the prefix as-, or no prefix to be present, the system to be represented
in its entirity requires 7 paradigms in all. Five of these complete1y
share the structure shown above, two are different, in lacking an
equivalent for the plural awa:raine. This regards:
1) The postpositions without prefix, which always occur in connection
with an immediate1y preceding word, e.g. ayu:mï wa:ra 'like your
father'. Plural suffixing is confined to the word preceding the post-
position, e.g. ayu:mïko~ wa:ra 'like your(plur.) father(s)'. The para-
digm of these postpositions is in other respects equal to the one shown
above:                       plural            mbo-process       mbo-process and
                       proeess                             plural combined
          wa:ra
          Iike
no-       wa:rano      wa:rano:koij      'wa:ranombo       wa:rano:konimbo
process   one who is   those who are     one who is not    those who are not
          like -       Iike -            really Iike -     really Iike -
 256                           THE CARIB LANGUAGE
2) The postpositions containing the personal prefix for first person,119
 e.g. wa:ra 'like me', ye:ko:sa 'with me, at my house', ï:ta 'in me'.
Their paradigm is equal to the one shown under 1): wa:rano 'one who
is like me', ye:ko:simo 'one who lives with me', etc.
    As shown in the first paradigm, in the word formed by a combination
of personal prefixation and the plural process (awa:ra.ine) the plurality
pertains to the personal exponent: 'you, plural'. When hesides these
two also the no-process is applied (awa:rano:koij) the situation may
he more complicated. In the cases known to me, the plurality is related
to the non-personal part of the word: 'those who are like you'. However,
it is conceivable that the plurality may aIso pertain to the personal
part of the word, making possible two further interpretaJtions: 'those
who are like you(plur.), and 'one who is like you(plur.)'. Actually, this
kind of ambiguity has been found in similar verba! formations ; but I
have omitted to ascertain its existence with the postpositions (see
3.1.3.2.14 IV).
   Finally, the position of the system in relation to the other word
classes may he summarized. The personaI prefixes are shared with verbs
and nouns, and furthermore the plural with -ne and diphthongization is
shared with the verbs only. The as-category, formed by means of a
prefix that can replace a- in the paradigm, is as a productive category
peculiar to the postpositions (for this reason it was not discussed in
3.3.2. together with the personal categories). Finally, the reduced
system as shown sub 1), without the ne-plural, is identical with the
complete system of the adjectives (see helow, 3.4.5.).","[274, 275, 276]"
"3.2.1.2. NOM1NAL WORD-GROUPS
   It is necessary to make same observations about the worelgroup-
character of the constructions elesignateel B in the last section. As we
saw there, in many nouns a special syntactic suffixation with -rï
occurred, sometimes accompanied by vowel-alternation, e.g. A kuri:yara
'boat', B moxko ya:wo ku:riya:rarï 'uncle's boat'; whereas in cases
where the synt,actic category is lacking these constructions merely
contain the monomorphematic noun: e:tï 'name', moxko ya:wo e:tï
'uncle's name'.
   WhaJt has so far not been mentioneel, however, is that in the B-
constructions the two componenfs must always immeeliately foIlow
each other,92 a fact which may weIl make us wonder whether these
constructions are not compounds rather than word-groups. The con-
sequence of such an assumption would be that what we called 'members
of the syntactic B-category' in the last section could no longer he
assigneel the status of worels since they would only occur as parts of
compounds.
   There are, however, three indications pointing to the fact that, in91   A nasal as final phoneme is rare in monomorphematic words, see 1.1.2.2.
92    1t is true that mi 'late' and ~me plu ral .~makoiJ 'smaU' may be placed between
     the two nouns, but it is doubtful wheth~r these elements themselves are words
      and not parts of words. Mi itself cannot be separated by a third word from
      the word to which it beloogs (ya:wo mi 'my late uncle'); ~me and imakojij
      are perhaps identical with the words ï';>me, ï~makojij 'child, children' (loss of
      initial ï is a normal sandhi-phenomenon) but, when used as diminutives, they
     must always immediately foUow the word to which they belong (pïrï:wa ';>me
     'smaU arrow', pïrï:wa ~makoiJ 'smaU arrows'). On ;>me, also 2.1.1.4.3B.·
 220                          THE CARIB LANGUAGE
 spite of the absence of clear separability, we have to do with word-
groups and not with compounds. 93
 1) In analogous constructions with a rnonornorphernatic verb following
a noun there is clear separability, e.g. by na~net3 'first': moxko ya:wo
 (na~net3) kura:ma kïnoxtaij 'he will (first) corne tI) look after uncle',
see 3.1.1.(lb).
2) The first nominal component of the eonstruction remains subject
to suffixation without any restriction, which is generally not the case
with compounds. E.g. maina e:marï 'path to a garden' (maina 'garden',
o:ma 'path'), imainarï:ko'Ïj e:marï 'a path to their gardens'.
3) Each of the two cornponents remains subject to the rules of word-
structure, formulated in chapter 2.
   Finally, clear isolability exists in the A-nouns or, where the syn-
tactie differentiati011 is laeking, in the rnonornorphematic nouns. They
rnay eonstitute the tatal word-content of a sentence, e.g. kuri:yara!
'a boat !', a possibility which m011omorphematic verbs (3.1.1.) and
postpositions (3.3.1.) do not have.","[239, 240]"
"
150 See 3.2.1. The syntactical process consists here in the simultaneous addition
    of a suffix -rï and a prefix y-. The occurrence of y- with these numerals is
    remarkablc, because with the nouns it is confined to a few isolated cases:
    as a rule, there is only -rï.

lä3 The personal prefixes (in this example, i- for third person) are always added
    to thc words as thcy appear in the syntactic rï-category; see 3.2.2.1.

  3) mo:rokoiJ o:ruwa:nokofj se wa 'I want those triple ones' (mo:rokoij
  'those', se wa 'I want').
  Personal prefixation and -koiJ may he applied together:
 iyo:ruwa:ncwïkoiij mo:se mafj 'he is the third of them'.
     Suffixing with -no, with similar semantic correlate, bas also heen
 found with the postpositions and the adjectives, e.g. eko:sa 'at, with',
 eko:sano 'one who is at, with', ka:wo 'high', ka:wono 'one who is high'
  (3.3.4., 3.4.2.). Yet, I do not believe that th is process is to he identified
 with the process discussed here, because there are also important
 differences, both with regard to their morphological and to their
 semantic properties.
     MorphologicaUy, both processes ean he combined with plu ral -koij:
 o:ruwa:nokofj 'triple ones', eko:sano:koij 'those at, with', ka:wono:koij
 'high ones'. Personal prefixation, however, may he combined with
 numerical -no, but cannot he combined with adjectival -no. It is true
 that with the postpositions, -no and a personal prefix may he found
 within the same word (e.g. aye:ko:satlo 'one staying with you') ; but
still the situation is essentially different from the one we are finding
with th.e numerical category, because with the postpositions personal
prefixture may occur as weU without -no heing present (e.g. aye:ko:sa
 'with you'), which is not tnte for the numerals. FinaUy, the syntactic
 N-distinction does not occur together with the adjectival and post-
positional no-process, but is strictly confined to tbe nouns and the
numerals witb -no.
     Syntaotically, adjectival and postpositional no-formations may be
connected with an immediately foUowing noun, e.g. ka:wono we:we
ca high tree', aye:ko:sano kari~na 'a man staying with you'. Neither
numerical no-formations nor nouns can be used in groups of this type.
     011 the other hand, the numerical no-category has one important
feature in common with the nouns, and with the noul1s only: the syn-
tactic rï-distinction. Moreover, syntactically they are probably 154 fuUy
equivalent. Therefore, I am of the opinion that the numerical no-process
may weU he regarded as a means by which numerals are transposed
to the nominal class.","[303, 304]"

2. THE STRUCTURE OF THE WORD FaRMS                       2.0. INTRODUCTION   We open this chapter with an outline of the most conspicuous features
of the Carib lexicon. To begin with, the number of words with relatively
many syllabi es - three or more - is high as compared with that in
many other languages. If we consider solely the words without affixes,
we find that though bisyllabic words are the most frequent, they
scarcely outnumber those with three syllabies. Words with four syllables
are also numerous. Only those with five and six syllables are relatively
rare, while none was found with seven or more. Among the words that
contain affixes much larger numbers of syllables were found. Tt was
impossible to determine an upper limit: application of all the productive
morphological processes could produce words of 14 syllabies, but I
am not certain whether words of such length are ever used and accepted
as normal. However, words with as many as 8 or 9 syllables were found
to occur, while words with 7 syllables are common, and words with
5 or 6 syllables are very common.
   The high frequency of words with relatively many syllables is prob-
ably related to the drastic limitations on the distribution of many of
the Carib phonemes, since the number of the latter is not particularly
low (17 C, 18 V). The most important limitation consists in the st rong
preference for a regular alternation of consonants and vowels. This
preference results from the following three factors:
1) Sequences of more than two consonants or of more than two vowels
do not occur (with the exception of a few loan-words).
2) A sequence of two consonants is not possible in final position
(except for one word wich occurs as a doublet of a longer form which
bas no CC-sequence in final position), nor in initial position (except
for a few enclitics). In addition part of the possible CC-combinations
cannot occur in certain intervocalic positions either.
3) A sequence of two vowels is not to the same extent subject to
positional limitations as that of two consonants: VV occurs in initial
and final positions as weIl as between consonants. Yet the frequency
of VV-sequences is low.
                       THE STRUCTURE OF THE WORD FORMS                   ss
     Another very important limitation pertains to the distribution of the
  long and the short vowels. In monomorphematic words of given length
  and given consonantal structure at most two different pattems of long
  and short vowels are possible, and in many cases only one such pattern
  is possible. For instance, in monomorphematic words containing four
 vowels, none of them diphthongs, and no consonant clusters, only two
  types of vocalic structure are possible: either that of kuri:yara 'canoe',
  with long second vowe1, or that of ka:rawa:si 'species of tree', with
 long first and third vowel. Other vocalisms are either fuUy excluded,
 or restricted to polymorphematic words. An example of the latJter is
 provided by kïne:ka:toij 'they bite him', from e:ka 'to bite' with kïn-
 and -:to1J.
    A third important distributional limitation consists in the exclusion
 of all consonants bUil: 1j and "" from final position.
    Finally, the Carib word is characterized by carrying a word accent.
 Except in certain cases of sandhi and of special emphasis 1 it faUs on
 the sec 0 n d long vowel counted from the heginning of the word, or,
 if there is no or only one long vowel, on the final vowel. Vowels
 foUowed bytwo consonants and diphthongs count as long for this
purpose. Only if there are more than two long vowels, VCC-sequences,
or diphthongs, the accent to a certain extent is free.
    The formal properties of the Carib words outlined above will be
 dealt with more fuUy.in the following sections. First, however, we
must consider the method which has been used, and in particular two
factors that have limited its application.
    The first limitation concerns the establishment of negative structure
rules: rules that state the impossibility of the occurrence of a particular
phoneme in a certain position or in combination with certain other
phonemes. N ow the possibility of its occurrence can, of course, he
proved by a single instance, but if no instance is attested this does not
constitute any proof of the impossibility of its occurrence: since the
available material comprises only part of the totallexicon the possibility
of its fortuitous exclusion from our material cannot he ignored.
    This problem scarcely arises when the negative rule applies to all
or to agreat many words in the lexicon, but it becomes the more
apparent, the more specific the property to which the rule appliea.
Thus the rule that in Carib 1j and "" cannot occur at the heginning of
a word, can safely be established hecause it is supported by all the 1   See 2.4.1. and 2.5.2.
 56                          THE CARIB LANGUAGE
  available lexica! malterial. However, the question, for instance, whether
  the absence from our Carib material of the vowel sequence u:ï is
  accidental or not, cannot he answered with certainty. Many of the
 conceivable combinations of two vowe1s are found realized, and it may
  very well be that if our material had been more eXTtensive, words
 cOilitaining this sequence would have been found. This consideration
  is corroborated by the fact that a case was found of the similar com-
 bination i:ï.
     Only the statistical examination of more extensive lexicographic
 material than is at present available could indicate the degree of
 probability that the lack of an instance of the occurrence of a phoneme
 in a particular combination or position reflects a negative structure
 rule. Yet on the basis of such considerations as were applied in the
 preceding paragraph with regard to the initial nasals and to the vowel
 sequence u:ï it is possible, in spite of gaps in the material, to make
 rough distinctions between instanees in which the existence of a
 negative structure rule is likely and those in which no staltement as to
 its existence can he made. In the former case it will he said thalt in
 a partictrlar position or in a particular sequence the occurrence of a
 certain phoneme is impossible; in the laUer case I shall speak of its
 not having been found.
    The second limiting factor occurs in the search for positive structure
 rules. These positive rules are in no sense ""the reverse"" of the negative
ones since they do not pertain to what is possible in the language, but
to what actually occurs. 2 Therefore they can only he established on the
basis of the fullest possible inventory of the lexicon, which is out of
the question in the present state of research. Only in a few cases of
evident tendencies has it been possible to formulate some positive rules,
that is to say, to make statements ahout the frequency of certain
phoneme sequences or about the frequency of a particular phoneme
in a certain position. For instanee, the loan-words ma:ti 'mate' and
ti:ru 'cannon' are stated to be the only cases found containing the
sequence ti; or: final fj and '3 are stated to be more frequent in words
that contain suffixes than in words not containing suffixes.
    The rules pertaining to the structure of the Carib word win he
found to he of three kinds:I   E. M. Uhlenbeck, De structuur van het Javaanse morpheem, VerhandelilIum

2) positional rules
3) rules of vocalic structure.
  The third type formulail:es the limitations - already mentioned in
passing - on the distribution of long and short vowels, which are
distributed over the word-forms in accordance with a limitednumber
of regular pattems.
  The validity of all these structure rules extends in principle to the
whole vocabulary. We shall see, however, thail: in the formation of
certain 1110rphological categories this general regularity is sometimes
disturhed. These disturbances occur with regard to only a few of the
sequential and the positional rules. Vlith regard to the rules of vocalic
stmcture, however, they occur to a very considerabIe extent.
  Our procedure will he as follows. First we shall formulate the rul es
(in 2.1.) and then give a survey of the phenomena thaJt interfere with
these rules (in 2.2.). This will be followed by separate sections on
enclitics (2.3.), sandhi (2.4.) and word accent (2.5.).","[73, 74, 75, 76, 77]"
"3.1.3.2.12.     The mi-category
   The mï-process ean only occur in combination with the topo-process
 (3.1.3.2.7.). The following alternating prefix es occur:
 1) mi-
2) m-
 The first is used when the topo-formation begins with a consonant.
the second when it begins with avowel. After m-, e: and e are replaced
by 0:, o.
Examples:
1) weitopo 'dwelling-place', mïweitopo 'the dwelling-place of all of us' ;
2) aro:topo 'means of taking', maro:topo 'means of taking all of us';
    ene:topo 'means of seeing', mone:topo 'means of seeing all of us'.
   Semantica1ly, the members of the mï-eategory seem to agree with the
pet""sonal prefix-categories, though their personal referenee is not
c1early dependent on the speechevent. As far as I can see, their refer-
ence is not subject to any restriction to the speaker, the hearer, or
the group to which they consider themselves to beloog, but they can
colleotively refer to anybody. They cau, however, only refer to human
beings. 2424   The formation mïkï:topo, on the basis of ki 'to rasp', was at once understood
     and accepted, with the comment that rasps for people fortunately do not
     exist.

    The substantivising nO'-process is also found in the nouns (3.2.2.5.),
 while it bas a central position in the system of the postpositions (3.3.4.)
 and the adjectives (3.4.2.). In the last two classes the process is
 applied directly to the monomorphematic postpositions or adjectives,
 whereas in the verbal class it can only occur in combinart:ion with -xpa
  (3.1.3.2.6.) and -me (3.1.3.2.11.).
    With postpositions and adjectives -n~ is the main suffix-altemant,
 while -tJ also plays some part. Although with the verbs it is only the
 latter alternant that is found, we adhere to the names nO'-process and
 nO'-category.
 A) In the case of combination with -xpa, the alternant -tJ is placed
after this nega.tion-suffix, which undergoes the following modifications:
a is replaced by i, P by b and x is lost. 25
Examples:
etaxpa 'unheard', e:tabïtJ 'one who is not heard'; itundaxpa 'not ar-
riving', itundabïtJ 'one who does not arrive'.
Irregular is the nO'-formation by the side of e:ixpa 'not being', viz.
e:bitJ 'one who is not', without i-.
B) In the case of combination with -me, the alternant -tJ is placed
after this suffix. The vowel e in me is replaced by a.
Example:
wO':to~me 'in order to kill', wO':tO'~matJ 'something to kill with'.","[166, 167]"
"3.2.2.7.2.   Transposition to the transitive verbs
 Transposition to the transitive verbs shows great fonnal diversity.
We find suffixation of monomorphematic nouns with:
 1) -xto
 2) -ma
 3) -ka
 4) -no
 5) -do
 6) -ga
 7) -ro
 8) -ko
 9) -ndo
10) -pa
11) -katï
12) -nopï   In this section I shall try to show that, in spite of this groot diver-
sity, there is only one transpositional category, the counterpart of the
                                MORPHOLOGY                              235 intransitive category discussed in the last section; the reasons being
 a) the almost fully complementary distribution, and b) the semantic
 identity of the twelve suffixes.
   There are, however, $Ome facts that would seem to argue against the
 assumption that there is one category: c) the occurrence of the twelve
suffix es is only very partly dependent Upoll rul es, d) in the case of
some nouns we find doublets, and e) a numher of these doublets are,
to a certain extent, semantically differentiated, so that in these cases
there is no complete semantic identity of the suffixes. As will be
apparent from tbe material to be presented here, in d) and e) we are
concemed with phenomena of marginal importance which do Ilot detract
from the assumption of a pre{lominant unity. Tbe impossibility to
formulate a rule which predicts the occurrence of all the alternants is
a more serious objection ; we shall, bowever, find some indications
pointing to the fact that the first suffixation in our list, that with -xto,
is at present the only productive one among the 12 suffixations.
   We shall first discuss the twelve suffixations and the reduction
which certain nouns undergo in the process of suffixation. This wiII
he followed by a definition of their semantic aspect, and a discussion
of the doublets referred to sub d and e).
   The only regularity that could he established concerns the occurrence
of certain alternants with nouns end1ng in a nasa! or in nï, nu. In the
first place we find that the fourth altemant, -no invariably occurs with
nouns ending in ij; e.g.:
4) po:St""iJ 'sweetness', po:si:no 'to sweeten'.
This -no shows dear parallelism to the alternant -na of the intransitive
process. Like -na, -no was further found with some nouns ending in
nïand nu:
4) asi:woinï 'cleamess', asi:woino 'to cause to become dear'; amu:nu
'whiteness', amu:no 'to cause to becOI11e white'.
Here toa, however, other alternants are found with ïxko:nï and me:nu.
5) ïxko:nï 'dirt', ïxkondo 'to make dirty'.
6) me:nu 'blood', mefl,.ga 'to cause to bleed'.
Tbe same aItemant may perhaps he assumed to occur with the word
e:r~, ending in the ot:her nasaI, t}:
5) e:r~ 'watchman', e:rando 'to have guarded'.
The same may apply to:
5) yonài 'covering', yondo 'to cover'.
236                           THE CARIB LANGUAGE
  The other nine alternants are found with nouns not ending in a
nasal, ni} nu or ndi; apart from this, their occurrence does not seem to
he subject to any rule. We do find, however, that in the available
material three altemants occur much more frequently than the others.
The nurnerica1 proportions in a total of 127 cases are as follows:
 1) -xto         47 times
 2) -ma          29""
 3) -ka          26""
 7) -1""0         12
 8) -ka            5
                        ""
                        ""
 9) -ndo          4
10) -pa           2
                      ""
11) -kati        once
                      ""
12) -nopï
                    ""
    Of ·the three most frequent altemants, -ka 108 was not found in
loanwords, while -:rto' and -ma were; e.g. areisi 'rice', areisixto 'to sup-
ply with rice'; po:si 'kiss', po:sima 'to kiss'.109 It may he concluded
from this that only -xto and -ma are possibly productive suffixes. If
one has to choose between these two, i.t seems most probable to me
that -xto is productive. The reasons are (a) the greater frequency of
-xto in the material, (b) the fact that verbs with -xto formed by
myself were often accepted, and (c) the fact that in at lea:st six
loonwords, where a form from Sranan, clearly recog:nisable as such,
precedes -ma} it is very doubtful whether the latter ever occurs by
itse1f, as a noun. This is the case with: fatJgama 'to receive', kara:rima
'to get finished', pa:sama 'to pass', pïreima 'to pretend something',
ru:ruma 'to spy, tie in wait for', wi:nima 'to win something'. A different
case, however, is po:sima mentioned above, by the side of which po:si
'kiss' does occur. Further investigation will he necessary as to this
problem of productivity. More examples and an enumeration of the108 Transpositional suffixation with -ka (in case of final nasal with -ga) is
    also found with onomatopoeic and soundsymbolic words; it results in tran-
    sitive verbs. E.g. ko:ro 'depicts a scrubbing sound', ko:roka 'to scrub, rub,
    sweep'; pi:ri 'flash !', pi:rika 'to make glitter, to make shoot sparks';
    bO'Jbo"" 'bang bang I' ixsano:ri kïbo'Jbo,!ga:to;j 'its coldness (its, of the rain)
    came bang bang down upon us' (ixsano:rï 'its coldness').
109 It should be noted that one of the extremely rare cases with 10) -pa happens
    to be a loanword as weil: to:ri 'story', to:ripa 'to teil someone a story'.
    The intransitive transposition, too, in fo:ri takes place, not with the regular
    -ta, but with -'Wa (3.2.2.7.1.).
                                MORPHOLOGY                               237 cases in my material with the infrequent altemants 7-12, will he given
 in the discussion of the semantic aspect.
     Nouns where the formation of a syntactic category does not, or does
 not only, depend on suffix3Ition with -rï or -ru, have the same vowel
 in the transposition-category as in the B-category. Also in the case of
 irregularities in the syntactic categories, the transpositional categories
 always follow the B-category. E.g. A o:ma B e:marï 'path', e:maxto
 'to make a p3lth for someone'; A auxto B auxtï 'house', auxtïma 'to
 build a house for someone'; A kiye:re B ixkere:ri 'cassava', ixkerexto
 'to give someone cassava'.
     With regard to the loss of a final syllable ti, ki, ku, rï, or ru, the
 situation is probably exactly the same as with the intransitive process
 discussed in the last section. In practically all the cases mentioned
 there, and in twelve further cases, it was established that they also
 lose the final syllable when they are suffixed with -xto. The twe1ve
 new cases are: yaxtï 'firewood', yaxto 'to put firewood on fire'; amo:tï
 'strap, sling', amoxto 'to provide with astrap, sling'; apu:tï 'cover',
 apuxto 'to provide with a cover'; u'lve:tï 'stool', uwe:ka 'to relieve
 oneself'; ï:potï 'hair, feathers growing on body', ï:poxto 'to provide with
 hair, feathers'; e~we:tï 'fringe', e~wexto 'to provide w~th fringe';
ïmbakï:tï 'lath', ïmbakixka 'to strengthen with laths'; ra:rï 'flat surface',
ra:ka 'to cause something to get flat surfaces' ; anu:ru 'tongue, vibrating
lath on drum-skin', anuxto 'to provide with such a lath'; aiku:ru 'liquid',
 aikuxto 'to make liquid'; inda:rï 'mouth', ïndaxto 'to provide with
a mouth, an opening'; axsa:ri 'gutter', axsaxto 'to dig a gutter round
a house'.
    Retention of the final syllable ti or rï, as with the intransitive verbs,
was found in a:rï 'foliage, wiek of oil-Iamp', a:rïxto 'to provide with a
wiek'; mo:rï 'noise', mo:rika 'to cause 10 make a noise' ; and also in
e:tï 'name', efi:ka 'to give a name'.
    The meaning of the members of the transitive category may be
defined as:
(a) to cause to become,
(b) to make produce, to produce for another,
 (c) to give, provide with,
(d) to handle, to apply to something,
that which is designated by the corresponding monomorphematic noun.
    I suppose that we are again concerned here with one and the same
semantic distinction, and that it depends on the lexical meaning of
 238                            THE CARIB LANGUAGE
  a noun whether the resulting verb is to be interpreted in terms of a,
  b, c or d. As to a, b and c, there is c1ear paralle1ism to the semantic
  definition of the intransitive category: we find side by side (a) to
  become versus to cause to become, (b) to produce by oneself or for
  oneself versus to make produce, to produce for another person, (c) to
 obtain versus to give, provide something with something else.
     In support of the assumption that there is no semantic difference
 among the nine suffix-alternants, even though their occurrence is not
 subject to a hard-and-fast rule, as far as possible examples will now
 to he given for each alternant which represent all the four semantic
 types. For the rare altemants 7-12 all the cases in my material are
 Hsted.

wo:toka 'to go catching fish for a person' ; (c) e:ti 'name', etï:ka 'to
give a person a name'; (d) wa:re 'song', wa:reka 'to make a song on

become blaak'; ka:mi 'pale-red colour', ka:miro 'to cause to become
pale-red'; ke:pu 'wet', ke:pztro 'to cause to become wet'; ko:rï 'decay',110   See sub (b) the same word, with an interpretation in terms of 'to produce
      for someone else'. In this case the informant spontaneously indicated the two
      situations in which the word could he used: one ""when someone needs much
      cassava at a time, 50 that he is assisted in lifting it"", the other ""when people
      have nothing more to eat and friends provide them with the necessities of
      lifc"".

12) The case with -nopï: (d) epi:tï 'medicine' , epi:nopï 'to treat a

   The material tisted above accords with the assumption that the
formal differences among the ni ne suffixes are not paralleled by a
semantic difference. It is tree that in 8-12 not all three possibilities
of interpretation a, band care represented in each case, but in view
of the limited material this was hardly to he expected.","[254, 255, 256, 257, 258, 259]"
"3.4.7.    TRANSPOSITIONAL AD]ECTIVES
    Every verb and every noun can probably he transposed to the system
 of the adjectives. This is effected in the following ways.
 1) Verbs, by suffixation with -sene, in certain cases attended by pre-
 fiXiture of i- or by removal of an initial w, according to the rules
 fonnulated in 3.1.3.8. E.g. wo:pï 'to come', opï:sene 'just come'.
2) Nouns, except the five cases mentioned under 3, by prefixing with
 t-, tï- or tu- and suffixing with -ke, -ne, -re or -me; e.g. on the basis
of wa:re 'song', tuwa:reke 'knowing many songs' (3.2.2.8.). The same
 process is applied to a small number of verbs as weU, e.g. 11 :'u/a 'to
dance', tuwa:lle 'fond of dancing' (3.1.3.8. note).
3) Five nourus are tran,sposed by suffixation with -pe or -me and re-
moval of a fragment of the base: panaxtorï I panaxpe 'strength' /,strong',
parixtorîl parixpe 'violence'/,violent', yaiJsikï:rï I yaiJsi:pe 'depth' I'deep',
mo:siiJlmo:si:pe 'length' I 'long', sa:niiJl sa:ni:me 'shortness' l'short'.
    The transposed verbs with -sene have a no-category with -'rJ and
vowel change, exactly like the monomorphematic adjectives of the type
ipi:piye (3.4.2C.a.); e.g. opï:sene I opï:sena'rJ 'just come' /,one who has
just come'. Also the nc- and the mbo-processes, and their combination,
are applied in a fuUy regular way (3.1.3.8. and 3.4.5.).
    Both the regular transposed nouns and the five irregular cases men-
tioned under 3, fuUy share the semantic distinctions as illustrated in
the paradigm of 3.4.5. FonnaUy ho wever , they show some deviations.
These concern:131   I have not found any semantic difference between this word and the next one.
                                   MORPHOLOGY                                   269 A) The forrnation of the no-category.
   This is effected by suffixing with -'3, as with a number of mono-
morphematic adjectives ending in e (3.4.2C.a.). The replacement of e
by a before the suffix does not take pla.ce, ho~ever. E.g. tuwa:reke
'knowing many songs', tuwa:rekery 'one who knows many songs', tuwa:-
rek~ tampo:ko 'an old man knowing many songs'. Three of the
irregular forma,tions mentioned under 3 do have the vowel change: in
one case e is replaced by a, in two others by ï: yafJsi:pe/yafJsi:pafJ
'deep'/'a deep one', mo:si:pe/mo:si:b""ir'3 'long'/,a long one' (with further
replacement of p by b), sa:ni:me / sa:ni:m~ 'short' /'a short one'. I do
not know how the formation is effected in panaxpe and parixpe.
B) The formation of the ne-category.
   Plurals are formed by suffixa.tion with:
 1) -mofJ
2) -nofJ
   The first occurs with the regular transpositioll's of the type tuwa:reke.
Before -mofJ, ~ disappears and the preceding vowel is replaced by a:.
E.g. tuwa:rek~ 'one who knows many songs', twwa:reka:mofJ 'persons
knowing many songs'.132
   The second altenlant is found with the three cases wÏ:th -~ and vowel-
change mentioned above; before the suffix, the final syllable is removed:
yafJsi:pary/yafJsi:nofJ 'a deep one' /,deep ones', mo:si:lii~/mo:si:no1j 'a
long one'f'long ones', sa:ni:mï'3'1sa:ni:no1j 'a short one'/'short ones'.133
   There is nothing that deserves special notice in:
C) The formation of the mbo-category.
   Suffixation takes place with -ïmbo, final ~ being repla.ced by n ; e.g.
tuwa:rek~/tuwa:reke:nïmbo 'one who knows many songs' /,one who
does not really know many songs'.","[288, 289]"
"B) In suffixing
   As the clusters occurring ll1 suffixes are identical with those in
monomorphematic words, and as they can only he added to bases
ending in avowel, it goes without saying that the resttlting poly-
morphematic words do not conJtain any sequences of consonants other
than those mentioned above.
   Sequences in which the first consonant belongs to the base, and the
second is part of the suffix also occur. They are brought about in two
ways. Firstly, there are formations from bases with a final consonant,
to which a suffix with initial consonant is added. Secondly, there are
somewhat more complicated processes involving not only suffixing but
also reduction of the base.
BI) Suffixing without reduction
   The only consonants occurring 111 final posItIOn are the nasals ij
and tJ. By adding a suffix the clusters nd and t'Jg may arise; e.g. on
the basis of e:ratJ 'guard', se:randoya 'I put a guard there', (cf. with
a vowe1 in final position o:ma 'pa1h', se:maxtoya 'I lay out a pa1h
there'), on 1he basis of auraiJ 'language' , auratJgofJ 'languages' (cf. with
a vowel in final position o:ma 'path', o:mako'ij 'paths').
   The chances of finding consonant clusters in this type of poly-
morphematic words are smaII, because in general final fJ and tJ have
a low frequency; besides, only some of the forms containing these
final nasals admit of suffixation.
B2) Suffixing with reduction
  Consonant clusters also arise, however, when to the vast majority 3 of
verbs ending in pï, tï, kï, rï. mï, ku, or ru, or to the verb wï:to 'to go',
3   The few instances in which reduction does not take place are all bivocalic:
    a:tï 'to clean', kï:rï 'to make', a:tnï 'to build a house', 'Wo:mi 'to enter'. There
    are also bivocalic words, however, where reduction does take place: e.g.
    'Wo:pï 'to come', ï:rï 'to give, to place', po:tnï 'to plant'. I have .not been able
    to find a rule governing the occurrence or non-occurrence of reduction, in
    these cases.
 60                            THE CARIB LANGUAGE
  a suffix is added with 0 n e initial consonant, with the exception of
  -ri and -:se. 4
     In the process of suffixation, the final syllable of the verb undergoes
  reduction. This reduction is counterbalanced by what may he termed
  compensation, either by the insertion of x, ~ or a nasal, or by length-
 ening, or by diphthongization of the vowe1 that has become final
 through the reduction. In this section we shall only deal with the first
 type of compensation, the insertion of x, ~ or a nasal, as it is only this
 type that gives rise to clusters. Weshall return to the second type
 - the lengthening of the final vowel - in 2.2.3.1B. and 2.2.3.3B2.
 The diphthongization of the fiual vowe1 will he discussed in 3.1.2.1.
 and 3.1.3.3.2.1.
    In cases of reduction with loss of pï, tï, kï, ku, or to, the compen-
 sation consists in the insertion of x before suffixes with initial p, tor k.
 Thus, for instance, on the basis of ena:pi 'to cat', with -poti, enaxpoti
 'to eat repeatedly', with -tafj, enaxtaij 'he will eat', with -ko, enaxko
 'eat it'. Before a suffix with initial n, however, ~ is inserted; e.g. with
-no, ena~no 'act of eating', with -nt""fj, ena~nerJ 'he ate'. The occurrence
of x before p, t, k and of ~ hefore n is in complete agreement with the
situation found in monomorphematic words - with the exception of
yû pa 'good' - and accentuates the exceptional character of this one
form.
    In the case of reduction with 1055 of mi a homorganic nasal m, n
or 13 is inserted hefore suffixes with an initial stop, while all: the same
time all altemant with voiced stop, instead of voiceless stop, is used.
Thus, on the basis of eka:numi 'to run', with -boti/poti, eka:numboti
'to runrepeatedly', with -dafj/tafj, kine:ka:nundafj 'he will run', with
-go/ko, aye:ka:nu13go 'run I'. If the suffix has initial n, ~ is inserted,
just as in the case of reduction with loss of pi, ti, kï, or ku, discussed
above. E.g. with -no, eka:ntûno 'running'. ThllS in the case of reduction
with loss of mi we again find altemants which give rise to only those
consonant seqllences that also occur in monomorphematic words. The
fact that, as in the case of formations on the basis of words with
final fj or 13 (see BI), suffix alternants with b, d, g occur instead of
p, t, k, confirms the exceptional character of the clusters in tampo:ko,
ka13kasa:pa and mi13ka:rï.
    Exactly the same phenomena of reduction and compensation OCCllr
4   On the syntactical category with -rï, see the verbaI class, 3.1.2. On the modal
    suffix -:sc, see 3.1.3.3.2.8.
                   THE STRUCTURE OF THE WORD FORMS                     61in some categories of polyrnorphematic words. W ords fonned with
the suffix -topo lose po when they are further suffixed with -ko1J or
with -me; in the fonner case there is compensation with X, in the latter
with ~. Thus, on the basis of wo 'to kill', wo:topo 'a mea.ns of killing',
wo:toxko1J 'means of killing', wo:to~me 'as a means of killing'. The
same phenomenon is found again when the two suffixes occur together,
in which case -kof] loses its final nasal before -me, and ~ is inserted.
E.g., 'U!o:to.rlwij 'means of killing', wo:to.rko~me 'as means of kiling'.","[79, 80, 81]"

II, on the other hand, has different altemants in these cases. Moreover
there is prefix-altemation depending on the nature of the initial
phoneme of the mononlOrphematic verb: one alternant occurs when the
latter begins with avowel other than ï, the other when it begins with
a consonant or with ï; in which latter case the prefix does not precede ij

    Diphthongisation of the final vowe1 as it occurs in the vetative verbs
 was also found in the optative-affirmative diphthongisation-process
 (3.1.3.3.2.6.). As the latter is also combined with personal prefixations
which, formally at least, are identical with those found here, we find
that by the side of every verb here designart:ed 'vetative', a formally
identica1 optativejaffirmative verb occurs; e.g., alongside kïku:ra:mai 1
 'you must not look after me', kïku:ra:mai2 'may you look after me,
you have rea1ly looked after me'.
   The question now arises whether - as has so far been assumed -
we have to do with different (homonymous) words, or with one and
the same? An argument against identification would seem to be, in
the first place, the considerabie difference hetween the meanings as
dlefitred for the vetative verbs on the one hand, and the optative-
affirmative verbs on the other: one category prohibits the same thing
that the other describes as desirabie. Vet it is not inconceivable that
the suggestion as to the existence of an important semantic difference
might he due to the definition we have chosen to give of the meanings66   Wï:ka 'to speak' and wï:to 'to go' hehave irregularly, just as this was the
     case in the fonnation of temporal and modal categories (s.ee 3.1.3.3.1.). In
     wi:ka loss of w does not occur, but the syllable wï: is replaced by i- :
     ika:ko 'you must speak'. The vetative has k- instead of kït- : kï:kai 'do not
      speak'. In the cas.e of 'WÏ:tQ 'to go' the ko-process may only be used in
     combination with the tamï-process, which has itself the semantic value 'to go'
     (helow, 3.1.3.4.3.). As with wi:ka, prefixation takes place with i-; furthermore
     the syllable tQ is lost by reduction before the infix -tamï-, which in its turn
     reduces the syllable mï to '3 hefore the imperative suffix -ko. Thus is formed
     itQ1Jgo 'you must go'. As is always the cas.e with imperatives formed both
     with -ko and -tamï, a shortened doublet in -ta occurs here: i: ta 'you must go'.
     The vetative of wï:to, like that of wï:ka, is formed irregularly with k- instead
     of kït-, while moreover, instead of diphthongisation of the final vowel, suffixa-
     tion with -'ij occurs: kï: to;j 'you must not go' . We:i 'to he' has aiko by the
     side of regular eiko 'you must he', with - as far as I could tell - the same
     meaning.
  192                               THE CARIB LANGUAGE
 in English. If we define the meaning of kïku:ra:mai always as 'I appeal
 to you - either in a positive or in negative sen se - with respect to
 looking after me', it would seem possible to conclude that we have
 to do with one word, whose meaning may he interpreted either in a
 positive sense ('may you look af ter me'), or in a negative sense ('do
 not look after me').
    There are, however, three arguments against identification. In the
 first place there is no complete correspondence between the semantic
 correlates of the pcrsonal prefixes in the vetative verbs and the for-
mally correspon<iing prefixes in the optativejaffinnative verbs. As the
following table shows, in the transitive formations with ki- (first line)
there is not much difference between the personal exponent of the
vetrutive and that of the optative-affinnative: the only difference is
 that the former, unlike rthe latter, does not seem to have the Ijyou-
reference as wel! as the youjme-reference. In the case of the formations
with kïsi:- however, there is no correspondence at all: to 'you' (left)
corresponds 'both of us' (right). In the case of the intransitives there
is correspondenee again in 50 far as formation takes place with a-, 0-,
ay- (third line), but not in so far it takes place with kït- (fourth line):              prefix          semantic value of this     semantic value of this

 be one (with our people), both of us really have been one (with our
 people).
    A second indieation that the two types are not identical is the fact
 that the transitive verbs have only two vetative categories, viz. those
 with the personal exponents you/me and you/him, while the intransitive
verbs have only one, that with the personal exponent you. If th ere was
identity iJt mighrt sure1y he expected that for all the eight (transitive
verbs) or four (intransitive verbs) personal distinctions of the optative/
affirmative, the vetative interpretation would be possible as weU; so
that, e.g. aku:ra:mai 'may he look after you, he has really looked after
you' would also admit of the interpretation 'he must not look after you'.
The latter is not the case, however. Moreover, the personal distinctions
which the vetative verbs do have, are exaotly the same as those of the
imperative verbs, whose status as separate categories is beyond dispute.
   Finally, a third argument against identificaJtion is to he found in the
fact thaJt whereas the same optative/affirmative value also belongs to
the categories with -<f3 and to those with -:se (3.1.3.3.2.10.), these
eategories can never be interpreted in a vetative way; e.g. apo:ro'nerj
'may you stop, you have really stopped', and apo:ro:pï:se 'so that you
may stop', can neither of them he inlterpreted as: 'you must not stop'.","[208, 209, 210, 211, 212, 213]"
"134  The exceptions are o:tï 'something, what', and Ilo:kï 'somebody, who', as it
     is not evident that they ""characterize with reference to the speech event or
     its partiCipants"" (Roman Jakobson, Shi/ters, verbal categories, aJld the
     Russian verb, 1957). On the other hand, same words that c1early do have
    the ""shifting"" character of deictic words do not belong to the morphological
     class described here: mi:}'a 'to the opposite side', mi).a:ro and miye:ro 'over
    there, far away', and )'a:ro'wa 'hither'.
135 In this distinction animate applies to people and animais. inanimate to plants
    and all other things.
136 Oxlo 'whatever' is c10sely related in meaning to 0: li; perhaps the only
    difference is that oxto has an affective connotation. Oxlo, however, has no
    counterpart referring to living creatures, such as o:tï has in no:kï 'somebody,
    who', nor does it take affixes as o:tï does (see 3.5.2.). The same applies to
    two other words which show same semantic and forma! resemblance to 0: ti:
    oxtoro 'a certain number, how many', and oxtono:11Ie 'for same reasan or
    other, why'; these words, toa, do not fit into the morphologica1 system of
    the demonstratives. There is, however, a word oxtono:mlRj 'the reason why',
    which occurs by the side of oxt01l0 :me in accordance with a process belonging
    to the postpositions and the adjectives (3.3.4. and 3.4.2.).
 272                           THE CARIB LANGUAGE
 Examples:
 no:kï ko me:nei? 'who did you see?' (ko interrogative partic1e),
 imemboko no:kï e:bïrjke 'because he was not a small living creature'
  (imemboko 'small', e:bïtJ ke 'because he was not').
    o :we 'where' and o:ya 'whither' have no animate COUIIlterpart.
    In the case of the definite demonstraJtÏves we also find the two
 distinctions animatejinanimate and locational-directional as opposed
 to non-Iocational-directional. Apart from these, however, there are
 some further distinctions.
    In the case of words referring to place or direction there is one
 further distinction: near as opposed to far-oH. Corresponding to the
 indefinite o:we 'where' there are i:ye 'there' and mo:e 'yonder', cor-
 responding to o:ya 'whither' there are i:ya 'thither' and mo~ya 'to
yonder'. I:ye and i:ya are only used to refer to the immediate vicinity
of the spot where the speech event is taking place, otherwise mo:e and
mo~ya are used.
Examples:
mene:ya1j? 'do you see it ?', i:ye seta:e 'I hear it over there' (nearby,
speaker and hearer are looking for an animal in the bushes ) ,
o:ya ko nï:to1j? 'where has he gone?', i:ya nï:toij 'he has gone that way'
 (speaker indicates the direction ).
o:we ko naij? 'where is he?', mo:e kïno~na:sa1j 'he is ea.ting over there'
 (somewhere else in the village),
o:ya ko nï:to1j? 'where has he gone ?', mo~ya nï:to1j ya:rï :wa 'he has
gone over there, up the river'.
    The distin.ction between nearhy and farther off is also present in
four of the five demonstratives which do not denote a place or a
direction. Thus e:nï refers to what is in the immediate vicinity of
the spot where the speech event is taking place, mo:nï to what is
farther oH.
Examples:
e:nï se ma1j? 'do you want this one here?' (se maij 'do you want'),
mo:nï para:Pi aitatJgo 'go and get that dish over there (para:pi 'dish'),
o:tï po:ko mo:ni po neixto1j? 'what were they occupied wÎlth over there?'
(o:tï po:ko 'with what', po 'at, in', neixtoij 'were they').1 37
131   When combined with an indication of time, mo :1Ii refers to greater remote-
      ness in time, e.g. mo:nï wi:ki 'next week'. When koro:po 'to-morrow' follows
      mo:nï, a nasal is inserted: mo:nï fjgoro:po 'the day aftel' to-morrow'. The
      addition of )IIC 'really, to a high degl'ee' produces mo:nï ~ne fjgoro:po 'two
      days after to-morrow'. Perhaps these combinations with inserted fj are
      compounds.
                                MORPHOLOGY                              273     There is a similar distinction in the use of e:ro and mo:ro, but here
 it does not function in relation to the place where speaker and hearer
 are, but to the speaker only. E:ro refers to what concerns the speaker,
 mo:ro to everything, whether nearby or far-off, that does not concern
 the speaker.
 Examples:
 e:ro auxto ta aye:mafJgo 'you must live in this house' (auxto 'house'),
 e:ro tu:na ta kïne:maiya:toij 'they live in this river area' (tu:na 'river,
 river area'),
 i.e. in the house, or the river area, where or noor where the speaker is;
mo:ro auxto ta aye:mafJgo 'you must live in that house',
mo:ro tu:na ta kïne:maiya:toij 'they live in that river area',
i.e. in a certain house or area where or near where the speaker is not
present.
     The only decisive faotor here is the presence or absence of the
 relation to the speaker and not, as with e:nï and mo:nï, the smaller or
greater diSitance from the spot where the speech event is taking place.
The following examples may serve to further illustrate this difference.
    After the question: e:nï se maij? 'do you want the one here?' it is
possible for an answer in the affirmative to contain another e:nï, e.g.
a:a e:nï se wa 'yes, I want the one here'. An answer in the negative
may contain, for in stance, the counterpart of e:nï, i.e. mo:nï 'the one
over there': uwa, mo:nï se wa 'no, I want the one over there', or also
e:ro 'the one near me': uwa, e:ro se wa 'no, I want the one near me'.
    After the question e:ro se maij? 'do you want the one near me?', on
the other hand, an answer in the affirma.tive does not contain another
e:ro, but mo:ro: a:a, mo:ro se wa 'yes, I want that one (the one not
near me)'. Here it is an answer in the negative that may contain
another e:ro: uwa e:ro se wa 'no, I want the one near me'; or also,
for installlce, e:nï: uwa, e:nï se wa 'no, I want théllt one here'.
    Besides the demonstratives referring in relation to the place of the
speech event and those referring in relation to the speaker, there is
thirdly, an anaphoric one: i:ro 'whéllt has just been mentioned'.
Examples:
i:ro wa:ra ro mandoij 'they did act in the way just described' (wa:ra
'like, way', ro 'indeed', mandoij 'they were, acted'),
i:ro ~ne se wa 'what you have just said I really want' pne 'really',
se wa 'I want').
There is no diSitinction between nearby and farther off in this case.
 274                           THE CARIB LANGUAGE
    When we turn tothe definite demonstra.tives referring to living
 creatures, we find a complete parallelism with e:nï and mo:ni in mo:se
 'living creature nearby', and mo:kï 'living creature not nearby'.
 Examples:
 mo:se o:mïya:ko kisa:ki:mai no:ro 'you must not trouble this girl here
 any more' (o:mïya:ko 'girl') ,
 mo~ya Wixsa ya:rï :wa mo:kï pï:yei wa 'I am going over there up the
 river, to the medici ne-man there' (pï:yei 'medicine-man').
 M o:se may express irritation or contempt, in which case the person
 referroo to is not necessarily in the immediate vicinity: o:we ko mo:se
wo:di na~ 'wherever isthat girll'
    No such complete parallelism with the corresponding demonstratives
 referring to inanimate objects, is found in the demonstratives involving
the participants of the speech event. Instead of two terms we find four:
au '1', amo:ro 'you', kïxko 'you and 1', and moxko 'he'; moreover there
is a semantic difference: whereas in the case of e:ro and mo:ro the
 speaker is only involved as a means to characterize something else
 (e:ro '.this with me'), au etc. refer directly to the participants in the
speech event themselves. Yet it seems to me that, rather than stressing
these differences, more importance should he attached to the agreement
shown by the six words in the e:ro-kïxko column, in that they all in
some way involve the participants ; for it is in this that all these six
words differ from those in the e:nï-mo:kï column.
    Finally there is here, 100, one anaphoric word, ino:ro 'the living
creature just mentioned'.
Example:
""paki:ra am se:nei"". ""ino:ro ro xkuru au wa"". 'I have seen a peccary'.
'That, indeed, was me'. (ro 'indeed', xkuru 'then, on that occasion',
aft wa 'was me'; speaker is Peccary-girl, showing herself in human
shape).","[291, 292, 293, 294]"
"3.4.6.    INCIDENTAL FORMATIONS
   Apart from the categories diseussed so far, a numher of ineidental
fOmlations has been found with a larger or smaller number of adjec-
tives.
 266                          THE CARIB LANGUAGE
 A) The naka-category.
    Suffixing with -naka has been found in the following cases: ka:wol
ka:wona:ka 'high'l'up', koro:nalkoro:naka 'deep'/,into the depths',
ma:po Inw:pona:ka 'ashore' I'ashore (direction )' poxpo I poxpona:ka
 'low' /,down', sefjgejsefjgena:ka 'near' I'nearer', tïxscltixsena:ka 'far' I
'farther away', kurando I kurandona:ka 'outside' /,owt, outside (direction )'.
The one case with final a, koro:na, has -ka instead of -naka.
    A special case is kopo:sena:ka 'to the other side of the river', which
might equally well correlate with kopo:seme '311: the opposite side' and
with kopo:se 'opposite side' (see 3.4.2C.b., and note).
    The meaning of the words with -naka is 'moving into the direction
of a place indicated by the monomorphematic adjective'. Cf., e.g. ka:wo
kïnoxsa~ 'it (an aeroplane) is approoching 311: agreat height', ka:wona:-
ka kïnoxsa~ 'it (a tree-trunk) is coming up', i.e. one end of the cut-
down tnmk because the other end sank away.
    Formations with -naka are also found with some postpositions
(3.3.8C.).
B) The mbo-category.
   In six cases the mbo-process was found directly applied to a mono-
morphematic adjective, without the no-process being applied at the
same time: ka:wolka:wombo 'high'j'from above', tixseltïxscmbo 'far'l
'from afar', sawo:nelsawo:nembo 'light (of weight)' I'abnormally
light',12R omi:yame I omï:yambome 'young, beautiful' I'not rea1ly beauti-
ful', po:tomeIPo:tombome 'iarge' /,abnormally large', poitomelPoitom-
bome 'beautiful' I'not really beautiful'.
   The cases ending in me disctlssed in 3.4.2C.c. have -mbo- infixed
before me.
   Their meaning again may be characterized by the term 'discrepancy'.
In the first two cases this discrepancy or deviation has the same purely
spatial sen se as is found in certain postpositions and demonstratives
(3.3.8E. and 3.5.2.).
C) The category with i- and -ri.
   Personal formations with a personal prefix and -ri, such as are found
with the nouns (3.2.2.1.), have been found with three adjectives:
ipa:to~nari    the transverse part of it
isa:wona:ri    the light part of it
iyo:poto:ri    the si ze of it.","[285, 286]"

1.2.1.1. LONG AND SHORT MONOPHTHONGS
   In the case of the phonemes I i i: ti ti: ï ï: a a: e e: 0 0: I we find
monophthongal articulations, with the exception of one of the four
allophones of le:l, the diphthong ei, which is distinguished from the
diphthong phoneme leil hy a more open articulation. 3o As the allo-30   Wherea.s generally in this book letters corre!'>pond to phonemes, in this section
     (1.2.1.) this is only true of letters between diagonal strokes. Their absence
     means that the letters represent phonetic segments.
                                    PHONOLOGY                                   49 phone ti has a very limited distribution, and the other allophones of
 le:1 are monophthongs, we treat this phoneme here, together with
 li, i:1 etc., rather than in the next section, together with lau, ail etc.
 1.2.1.1.1.     Open and half-open
   Allophones were found to occur in the case of the phonemes with
 open articula1:ion la a:1 and those with half-open articulation la 0:
e e:l. The number of allophones found with la a: 0 0:1 was two, with
lel three, with le:1 four. In general complete allophonic parallelism
 was found to exist in the case of the corresponding long and short
phonemes, excep1: for lel and Ie: I, as the allophone ei - referred to
above - of the latter phoneme has no counterpart in ,the case of lel.
   In the following table I shall try to relate the qualitative differences
which I heard with differences in tongue position, in terms of open-
close, front~back. The scope of my investigation did not permit me to
find out in each case in how far differences in both respects contributed
to the qualitative differences which I observed, nor was it possible for
me to establish whether factors other than these two might play a part.                       more front     less front    more front     less front

and for the rest they are free.
  The rules are the following:
I) a alld ;) are always found before f}, 1J and clusters; 31 a, a:, ;) and ;):
are always found before s.
2) t is always found before f} and '3. 3231 This is not the case with the corresponding long variants a: and 3:, because
   long vowels Camtot occur in these positions. See 2.1.1.4.1.
32 Long vowels cannot occur here, cf. note 31.

    Apart from these cases, no fixed regularity could he found: in one

 Within this freedom, however, a clear preference was observa:ble on
some points. In a material comprising some 700 words, obtained from
tape-recordings, the following tendencies could he noted:
 1) a was the moSlt: common allophOl1e in final positiOl1,34 a and a:
 hefore vowels and p t k m n w r. Only hefore y no preference for
either allophone could he found.
2) ;J was the most common allophOl1e in finaJ position,34 except when
imrnediately followed by a word with initial m w or r; ;J and ;J: were
the most commoll allophones before vowels and p t k.
o and 0: were the most common allophones before m w r, except when
/0:/ or /0/ occurred three times in successive syllables of a word; in
that case :J: or :) is practically always heard all three times.
Before y and n no clear preference was found for either allophone.
3) e was the most common allophone in final position; 34 e: hefore all
imrnediately following vowel; e and e: before all consonants, with the
following exceptions: hefore a consonant followed by i, t: was often
found to occur; before a nasal cluster e was often found to occur.
The diphthOl1g ei only occurred before r in a few cases.","[68, 69, 70]"
"1.1.2.     DISTRIBUTION AND CONTRAST1.1.2.1. VOICED AND VOICELESS STOPS   Contrast of voiced and voiceless stops is found in a limited number
of cases. Examples:17   B. Blach and G. L. Trager, Ol/tUne of linguistic allalysis, Baltimore 1962, p. 30.
 44                               THE CARIB LANGUAGE
b and p in ba:ku 'proper name', pa:to 'place', ara:bo 'species of fish',
uwa:po 'before', ambo:tï 'ta break', tampo:ko 'aid man';
d and t in diye:mo 'proper name', tïya:po 'marsh', wo:di 'littie sister',
wo:to 'fish';
9 and k in ïfJga:na 'behind', mïfJka:rï 'gill-slit'.
     Owing to the pecllliar distriblltion of the stops it proved to be
  impossible to find a single minimal pair: pand k were practically only,
 and t was only, found in initial and intervocalic positions and after or ;
  band d were chiefly, and 9 was only, fOlmd after a homorganic nasa!.
    Vet there is contrast, because certain words are not subject to this
 distributional tendency and contain p or kafter a nasal, or b or d in
 intervocalic or initial position. These words comprise OI1ly 3 cases with
 a cluster 'I11p or ""3k. 21 monol1lorphematic cases with b or d in initial
 or intervocalic position, and two types of polymorphematic words
 which all contain intervocalic b.
    The 3 cases with p or kafter a nasal are: tampo:ko 'old man',
 mïfJka:rï 'gill-slit', kafJkasa:pa 'large lizard'.
    With initial b tbe following words were found: ba'fJga, ba:ku 'proper
 names', biyo:ro 'term of abuse', beda:ki 'Christmas', ba:siya 'depttty',
 bi:ribi:ri 'flooded savanna', bo 'bang!', baij 'alas!', and bu13 'who is
 afflicted with'; othis last word is fornled on the basis of pe 'afflicteel
 with', by suffixing with -13. vowel-change anel replacement of p by b.1 K
    With initial d: diye:mo 'proper name'.
    With intervocalic b: kibainare 'proper name', itll:bïrï 'aid woman',
 tïsa:bake 'muddy', ara:bo 'species of fish', tïnu:berefJ 'plane' (tooi),
 waka:buij 'species of tree', su:rabaij 'beam of roof', ka:bCNa 'sheep',
ka:biri:ta 'gaat'; a small number of demonstratives formed by suffixing
with -baij, 19 e.g. o:tïba~ 'what kind of?' on the basis of o:tï 'what?';
and the words formed by suffixing with -""3, vowel -change, replacement
of p by band dropping of .r, on the basis of words which in their turn
are formed by suffixing of nOlms of verbs with -.rpa,20 e.g. ï:potï 'hair'.
i:po.rpa 'hairless' (with i-, -.rpa and loss of ï and ti), i:pobi""3 'a bald
person'.
    With d in intervocalic position: wo:di 'Iittie gir!', ma:kïdo:na 'proper

    There is reason to assume that the opposition voiced: voiceless stops
is marginal in Carib. To this points in the first place the small number18 See 3.3.4.

b, d which are available to prove the opposition. Moreover, at least
15 out of the 24 monomorphematic cases tha;t are available belong to
special sections of the lexicon: they include five proper names, three
familiar designations of persons (tampo:ko, itu:bïrï, wo:di) , an
ol1omatopoeia, and a temlof abuse; 5 words could be identified as
loan words (beda:ki and ba:siya are borrowed from Sranan, waka:buij
from Tupi,21 ka:bara and ka:biri:ta from Spanish 22) while the remain-
ing 9 mayalso he loon words.
   The exceptional character of the clusters 13k and mp is further con-
firmed by extemal as weIl as internal sandhi phenomena, the effect
of which is that only the clusters mb and 13g - and not mp and 13k -
occur on the boundaries of words and parts of words. 231.1.2.2.   ~    AND I}
   These two nasals have a limited distribution, which moreover coin-
cides only to a small extent with that of the other consonants. They
only occur in the clusters ijs, 13g, 13k; and in final position. The only
possibilities of contrast are the following:
 1) In clusters.
ij and x contrast before s, e.g. waijsi:ri 'littIe bird', axsa:rï 'gutter,
neek'.
13 and x contrast before k, e.g. mï13ka:rï 'gill-slit', ïxka:rï 'fishes in
water-pool'.
   Such cases of contrast are rare hecause, except xk, these clusters
have a very low frequency.24
2) In final position.
   Besides ij and 13 the only other consonant found in this position
is m. It only occurs, however, in two cases, am and ro~m, which are
c1early exceptional. 25
   Apart from m, therefore, in final position ij and 13 only contrast with
each other, e.g. auraij 'language', e:ra13 'guard'. As we shall see, how-
ever, this possibility of contrast is subject to a further limitation.
Words en ding in ij or 13 are not rare at all, but this is practically21   C. Tatevin, La Langue TaPihiya. Vienne 1910.

   completely due to the fact that a number of processes of suffixation
   have suffix-alternants ending in one of these nasais; this is the case
  with 8 out of 38 productive processes of suffixation. In words without
  a suffix the frequency of the nasals - especially that of '3 - is very
  low.
     This situation, which Ahlbrinck pointed out as early as 1931,26
  accounts for the fact that, although final ~ and ~ occur frequently,
  hardly any cases of minimal contrast wen! found: the only instances
  known to me are ma~ 'he is', ma~ 'one who serves as' (me 'as', with
  -13 and vowel change), ba~ 'alas!' ba13 'one who is afflicted with' (pe
  'afflicted with', with -13, vowel change and replacement of p by b).
     The following list 27 shows the monomorphematic cases with final
 ~ or '3:

117 Four of these words could he recognised as loanwords; perhaps the numher
    of borrowings is actually larger. Borrowings from Sranan are: watrakaij
    'jug', skeij 'body', te1J 'time'. Pa:rcn, 'fish-line' comes from French or possibly
     Spanish palangre. The name of the species of tree waka:buij, and ra1J
    'resembling' also occur in Tupi (Tatevin, op. cit.) and may therefore have
    been borrowed from that language.

    The productive processes of suffixation that have alternants ending
 in a nasal are the following. A provisional indication of their semantic
value is added:
 1) plural : -koij I -goij/-moijf -noij I -:toij I -saij/-SC'J I-ne/ -to-.
2) perfonner of the activity designated by the base: -nC'J.
3) possessor of characteristic designated by the base: -'3/-no.
4) temporal: -yaijf-saij/-yal-sal-:nol-e.
5) temporal, future: -taij/-take.
6) temporal, past: -yakoiJ/-sakoij/-koij.
7) temporal, past, affinnative: -ij/-tJ/-neYj/-ne.
8) interrogative: -ijl -:no.
   To conc1ude this section, let us once again consider the material
listed above, so as to make sure that the occurrence of ij or '} is not
conditioned by the preceding vowel.
   In monomorphematic words ij is found after all short vowels, Yj af.ter
a and e. In words containing one of the suffixes 1-8, we find the
following combinations: ij after a, 0; J:3 after a, e, ï. 28
   Thus we find that the two nasals are in contrast after a, e, ï. It could
not he established whether the combinations o'}, UYj, iYj were not found
by chance or wh ether they are impossible. 291.1.2.3. THE SEMIVOWELS
   The semivowels have been inc1uded in the group of consonant phone-
mes, as they are c1early not to be identified with the vowel phonemes
 u and i. We find that I) w and y occur between u: and i, i: and u
while 2) lI:i and i:u are also found in immediate succession. Examples:
1) su:wi 'Httle sister', 2) pu:i 'to expand'; 1) wi:yu 'species of tree',
2) e:kesi:u 'species of insect'.
   Moreover, w and y are subject to palatalization after i. In this

"3.1.3.2.2.   The mbo-category    The members of the category are formed by means of the suffix -mbo.
 Example: we:we ixko:to 'to chop wood', we:we ixko:tombo 'the farmer
chopping of wood, (coming home) away from wood-chopping (we:we
 'tree, wood').
    There are aIso mbo-formations which moreover contain a suffix with
 a syntactic function, -ri or -se; it seems plausible to assume that the
possibility to combine each of the three types (-mbo, -rimbo and
-sembo) with other words, here toa, confarms to the rules formulated
in 3.1.2.1. This would mean thart: members of the mbo-category (without
 -ri or -se) can only be expected to occur in a group (a) with se
'wanting to' or (b) with a verb of the type wo:pi 'to come', the latter
only, however, when the verb has na reduction of the final syllabie
and thus does not have the possibiIity of being suffixed with -se (see
3.1.2.1.).
    In fact, my material does not contain a single case of type (a)
- which does not necessarily mean that these groups with se do not
occur - but only groups of type (b) containing a verb meaning 'come,
go', etc. E.g., we:7JJe ixko:tombo kïnoxsa1j 'he is coming from the wood-
chopping, which is now a thing of the past'. The additioo of wïino
'away from' is possible, without my being able to establish any semantic
difference: we:we i.t:ko:tombo wïino kinoxsa1j.
    As long as one confines oneself to studying sentences like these,
one will be inclined to describe the meaning of the mbo-formations in
tenns like 'removal in space'. It is more likely, however, that in fact
the semantic wlue of -mbo is more general and comprises other forms
of diSitance or discrepancy besides the spatial one. We find confirmation

in accordance with the rules of 3.1.2.1., no longer require the presence
of pre-eminently 'spa.tial' verbs like 'corne' and 'go'. The semantic value
of such fonnations may he expressed as 'not really taking place', e.g.,
in ya:saka:ri wo:marïmbo sapo:i 'I caught my friend who was falling',
 (50 that his fall did not really take place; ya:saka:ri 'my friend',
wo:ma 'to fall' , sapo:i 'I caught'). Purely temporal removal is found
in mo:ro mata:pi ka:pïrïmbo i~wa eka:ri:ko 'teil about his fonner
making of the cassava-press' (mo:ro mata:pi 'the cassava-press', ka:pï
'to make', ~~wa 'by him', eka:ri:ko 'teil').
   N on-spatial di stance or discrepancy is also found when the mbo-
process is combined with other verbal processes (see below, 3.1.3.2.14.,

systems: nouns (3.2.2.2.), postpositions (3.3.6.), and adjectives
(3.4.4.).","[156, 157]"

3.2.2.4. THE ne-CA TEGORY   The process by means of which plurals are formed is applicable to
the monomorphematic nouns. The name of ne-process was introduced
in an earlier chapter (the verbs, 3.1.3.2.9.) and is used here, too, aI-
though in fact the alternant -ne does not play any part. Instead, two
 228                            THE CARIB LANGUAGE
 other alternants occur, the first of which was also found with the
 verbs (by the side of -ne): 101
 1) -ko~
 2) -goij
      The first of these is used when the monomorphematic noun ends in a
  vowel, the second when it ends in a nasal. Examples:
   1) wo:to 'fish', wo:toko~ 'fishes' ;
  2) e:ra'fj 'watchman', e:r0/t3goij 'watchmen'; auraij 'speech, story',
  aur0/t3go~ 'stories'.
      In three cases suffixation with -ko~ is accompanied by a further
  modification of the base: ï~me 'child', ï~mako1J 'children'; tamu:si
  'grandfather', ta:mukoij 'grandfathers' ; kaxto:po 'uncle', kaxto:ko~
  'uncles'.
     In a number of cases the rule given above does not apply at all:
 suffixation takes place with -sa~, -ya~ or -naij, and the final syllable
 before the suffix is usually lost.
     -Safj was found in three nouns ending in po: epïxpo 'pip, seed',
 epïxsa~ 'pips, seeds'; upuxpo 'head', ttpuxsa~ 'heads'; ye:po 'bOlle',
 ye:sa~ 'bones'.102 Also in uwa:poto 'prominent person', uwa:poto:saij
 'prominent persons', where the final syllable remains.
     Most words which form their plurals with -yaij or -naij refer to
 re1atives:
     -Yaij was found in apo:remïfJ 'owner', apo:reyaij 'owners'; no:tï
 'grandmother', no:ya~ 'grandmothers' ; pa:rï 'grandchild', pa:yaij by the
side of regular pa:rïkofj 'grandchildren'; pï:fi 'wife', pï:yaij 'wives'.
In other cases the final syllable remains: pi:rï 'younger bro.ther'.
pi:rïyafj 'younger brothers'; wokï:rï 'man', wokï:rïyaij 'men'; also in
wo:rïi 'woman', wo:rïiyaij 'women' there is no modification of the base.
    -Na~ was found in enauxti 'sister', enaunaij 'sisters'; ï:rui 'ol der
brother', iruina~ 'older brothers'.
    With all words denoting relatives the plural can also he used
honorifically; this applies both to the regular plurals (with -koij) and
to the irregular plurals enumerated above. E.g. tï')wo 'brother-in-Iaw',
tOwokoij 'brothers-in-Iaw, honoured brother-in-Iaw'; no:tï 'grand-
mother', no:yafj 'grandmothers, honoured grandmother'. To the words
with -yaij or -naij the regular suffix may he added. as well, in which101   See 3.1.3.2.9C, D.

"2.1.3.2. VOCALIC STRUCTURE OF WORDS WITH CLUSTER,
         WITHOUT DIPHTHONG
    In words containing a cluster other vocalic structures occur than
 those that have just been discussed. Before setting them out in a table
 we have to retum to the positional and other limitations to which
clusters are generally subject.
    \Ve have seen that clusters containing x or ~ in monomorphematic
 words ean only occur either after the first or after the second vowel
 (2.1.2.1.3.).
    This positional limitation does not apply to nasal clusters. As
weU as after the first and the second vowel they were found:
 1) After avowel other than the first or second, viz. in five mono-
morphematic cases: wa:yarimbo 'packing material woven from palm-
leaves', oko:yumbo 'water-spirit', oxkatombo 'spirit of the dead', 0:-
romenda 'storm spirit'; enu:mefJga 'to think of'; and also in eertain
polymorphematic words, in the first place formations with the suffix
-mbo.
2) After the second vowel, the first vowel being foUowed by a cluster
with xC or ~C; in one monomorphematic word, sahombo 'leaves', and
in polymorphematic words with -mbo.
3) After the first vowel, the second vowel being foUowed by a cluster
with xC or ~C; only in polymorphematic words, e.g. amboxko 'break
it', on the basis of ambo:tï 'to break', with -ko and replacement of ti
by x (2.1.1.1.1B2).
4) After both the first and the second vowel. Only one, poly-
morphematic, case was found: undimbo 'rotten tree-stump', on the basis
of undi 'trunk' with -mbo.
  As there is either no, or very limited monomorphematic material
available for the types listed in 1-4, we shall eonfine ourse1ves to the
words with xC, ~C or a nasal cluster after the first or second vowel.
In these words the foUowing types of vocalie structure may occur:19   Shorter words with long first vowel mayalso arise in the same way. see

words containing a cluster after the first vowel, and 3 or 5 vowels.
Only one vowel pattern was found in the words of this type that contain
4 vowels. The situation with regard to this point in words with 4 and
5 vowels, however, is not quite clear to me, because sufficient materia!
is lacking.
 82                           THE CARIB LANGUAGE
     In words with 5 vowels the voca1ic structure with a long vowe1 after
  the cluster was only found in one monomorphematic case in the mate-
  rial: m.a~m(],:taka:ra. The polymorphematic cases have the other type of
  vocalic stnlcture, e.g. oxkoto:potï 'the cutting of you into pieces',
  formed on the basis of ixko:to 'to cut' with 0-, -poti, and the loss
  of ï. The remarkable thing here is the shortening of the second vowe1
  in affixing, which prevents the occurrence of a pattem as found in
  ma~ m.a:taka:ra.
     With regard to the words with four vowels the question arises as
 to whether in these words, as in the words with three and five vowe1s,
 a vocalic structure with a long vowe1 after the cluster is not possible.
 The maierial does not a110w us to answer this question with certainty:
 only seven monomorphematic cases were found, all with the voca1ic
 structure of ka'l'jkasa.:pa 'lizard'. Polymorphematic words also have this
 structure, in some cases by means of affix-altemation or modification
 of the base. E.g. ûmo 'to begin', a~mo:ya~ 'he begins', but a~moya:to~
 'they begin'; ka:pï 'to make', woxkapï:rï 'to come into existence'.
    In trivocalic words with CC after the first vowel the occurrence of
 two types of vocalic structure is beyond doubt. There is, however,
another reason why we must discuss these cases in detail.
    The vocalic struoture - 11 - - is rare1y found; there are 12 cases
in my material. Besides the loan-word watraka~ 'water-jug', they include
the following words: paxporo 'all', paxpota 'past', ï~muru 'son', pixpisi,
toxkoro, pextoko 'diff. species of birds', pixkiri 'species of very small
fish', puxtoro~ 'swish', tuxkusi ',type of arrow', ïxsano 'cold', tïxpone 20
'being able to swim'. Apart from watraka~ all these words contain a
cluster with x or ~. No nasal clusters were found, perhaps they are
impossible.
    N ow in all these cases the sequence of a short vowel and x or P
alternates freely with a long vowel: by the side of paxporo, pa:poro
occurs, by the side of toxkoro, to:koro, etc. For furtber details about
this alternation, see 2.1.1.4.3. ahove.
    The altemants pa:poro, to:koro etc. show the same vocalic pattem
as the type ï:potï, ta:kuwa etc. disctlssed in 2.1.3.1. It should be noted
that ï:potï and the eight other cases always are heard with a long
vowel, which is never replaced by short vowe1 plus ;r or plus ~.
    There are some indications that the monomorphematic words with the20   This word looks like an adjectival formation with t- - -ne, on the basis of
     the verb ïxponu:mï 'to swim'. The drastical reduction of the base, with twü
     syllables instead of one, is otherwise not found (3.1.3.8., note).
                    THE STRUCTURE OF THE WORD FORMS                           83vocalic structure - "" - -, beside those with the much more frequent
structure - "" + -, take up a special position. In the first place, the
possibility to replace x or ~ by vowel length, as found in all 11 cases
with the pattern - "" - -, also arises when regular vocalic pattems
are disturbed as a consequence of pre- or suffixing; see the next section,
2.2.2.1. Secondly, it is remarkable that of the 11 éases possibly no less
than 6 are onomatopoeia or sound-symbolic words. This is certainly
true for puxtoro1J 'swish', and for the three bird's names, which repro-
duce the callof the bird; pi.xkiri, with its three i's, denotes a very sma11
fish swarming in large numbers, while tuxkusi may suggest the flash
of the flying arrow.
   There are polymorphematic words, too, with - "" - -. One of these,
Pmako~ 'c~i1dren', has alternation with a long vowe1 in the same way
as the monomorphematic cases: ï:mako~ also occurs. The word is a
formation, with the suffix -ko~ and vowel change, from ï~me or i:me
'child', one of the isolated bivocaJic words with alternation of ~ and
vowe1 length (2.1.1.4.3B.).
   The other polymorphematic cases in my material all contain a
bivocalic suffix; when it is added a fragment of the base is replaced
by x (2.1.1.l.1B2.). In these cases there is no alternation. 21 E.g. oxtoko
'come (plur.) I', formed on the basis of wo:pï 'to come', with the
suffixes -to-ko, loss of w and replacement of :pï by x; wïxtake '1'11 go',
on the basis of wï:to 'to go', with -take and replacement of :to by x;
pe:~potï 'to inundate again and again', on the basis of pe:kï 'to inundate',
with -poti and replacement of :kï by x.
   Of the two other trivocalic types, - "" + - has IlO alternation of ~
or x and vowe1 length. The same is true for the type containing CC
after the second vowe1; but for one exception which I cannot explain:
upuxpo/upu:po 'head'. Otherwise, in this pattem x cannot be replaced
by length: cf. aruxka 'to put in', but aru:ka 'to dry'; enexpo 'seen',
but ene:po 'to show'.","[100, 101, 102, 103]"

confine myself - as there is very little material for these types - to
those words that contain a diphthong as a first or second vowel. The
following types of voca1ic structure were found:
                      second vowel
                       diphthong                 first vowel diphthong  2 vowels            +D                        D-

  4 vowels            -D--                      D+--
Examples:
  2 vowels     sa: ka""     sand            aima         to smoke
  3 vowels     marauni     Maroni river    maipu:rj     tapir, pïimeke slow
  4 vowe\s     amïiyaro    you (plur.)     paipa:yana   mythical tiger
    Not included in the table is the pattem with j ust one (diphthongal)
 vowel, which is restricted to au 'I' and two onomatopoeic words: pau
 'bang' and tau 'slap'. The same is true of a bivoca1ic pattem with a
 short first vowel, only found in sowei 'swish'.
    In bivocalic words with a diphthongal first vowel, two vocalic struc-
 tures have been found, exernplified by maipu:ri and pïimeke. Of the
 second type, with short second vowel, only three further cases are
known to me: poitome 'young, beautiful', painaka 'perhaps' and painare
 'perhaps' (I could find no sernantic difference between these two). The
 more frequent vocalism, that of maipu:ri, has also been found in
trivocalic polymorphematic words formed on the basis of the bivocalic
type aima 't~ smoke': aima:ko 'you must smoke it'; in these formations
the final vowel is lengthened before any suffix. This adaptation to the
vocalic structure of the maipu:ri-type may he regarded as an indication
that the latter represents a regular pattern; pïimeke, poitome, painare
and painaka for some unknown reason deviating from this.
   Only three cases were found with four vowels: amïiyaro 'you (plur.)'
paipa:yana 'mythical tiger' , aipa:yawa 'shark'. Their vowel pattems
conform to those of the more frequent types marauni and maipu:ri.
   In discussing the phonernic status of the diphthongs (1.2.2.2.), we
found it very difficult to find cases of truly minima! contrast between
the diphthongs and the voweI sequences a:u, a:i, e:i, o:i u:i, i:i, OI-i,
e-i, o-i, u-i, i-i. It can now he shown that several rules of word struc-
ture cooperate to restrict the possibilities for such a minimal contrast;
without however completely excluding it. Together with the rather low
frequency of the diphthongs, this fact explains the absence of clear cases
of contrast in my material.
                    THE STRUCTURE OF THE WORD FORMS                               85 1) A positional rule (2.1.2.2.3.) restricts the sequences a:u etc. to
final position.
2) Because the frequency of the pattem - + - is very high, and that
of the pattem + - - is very low (2.1.3.1.), it is to he expected that
my trivocalic cases with avowel sequence are all of the type wana:u,
 with short first vowel and long second vowel.
3) According to the rule formulated in thissection, a bivocalic word
with D for second vowel must have a long first vowel: type sa:kau.
4) Together, 2 and 3 are responsible for the fact, that in my material
most cases of vowel sequence are of the type V:V, cooccurring with
a short vowel (as in wana:u); while diphthongs cooccur with a long
vowel (as in sa:katt).
   Yet, a few representatives of still less frequent types rome nearer
to showing minimal contrast:
1) The monovocalic words au '1', patl 'bang', talt 'slap', with e.g. pa:u
'island, land of the white people'.
2) The one exception on the ruIe restricting a:u etc. to final position
(2.1.2.2.3.): pïya:usi 'osprey'; with e.g. marauni 'Maroni river'.
3) The single fourvocalic case with sequence e-i known to me:ake:re-i 23
'species of bird'; with e.g. tapi:roi 'blunt arrow', kïse:nei 'don't look
at it' (e:ne 'to see').
      2.2. DISTURBANCE OF THE REGULAR PATTERNS
2.2.1. SEQUENTIAL RULES
   A sequence of two long vowels regularly occurs in polymorphematic
words when to words ending in V:V suffixes are added which lengthen
the immediately preceding vowe1 of the base.
   These suffixes are:
1) the seven suffixes -:pa, -:po, -:to, -:to -:ma, -:ma and -:noij which,
as we shall see,24 altemate with -xpa, -xpo, -xto, -xto, -~ma, -~ma and
-~noij ;

"3.6.5.   CONCLUDING REMARKS
    In principle any number can be expressed by means of the system
described in the preceding sections. In certain cases, however, it would
lead to very complicated combinations, am! it is my impression that
in aetual practice these are not, or rarely used.
   It is always possible to make use of numerals from Dutch or Sranan,
or of wl'itten figures, because, at least in the larger villages, instruction
in arithmetic has been given for years. Today the situation seems to
he that the Carib numerals are used by preference, but only in so far
as they are manageable.
   A symptom of the existence side by side of two different systems
of counting is the mistaken use of -karOna for 'ten' instead of for
'score'. This mistake, which I heard people make and correct a few
times, is probably due to the fact that it is impossible in the Carib
syste111 to combine ai/yapato:ro 10 with 2, 3, etc., so as to arrive at 20,
30, etc., while -kari~na can he thus combined with a numeral.

and anacoluthons, indicating them as such by a row of dots and, if
necessary, by an explanation in a note. Mutilation of word forms in
rapid speech has been indicated by placing in parentheses that part of
the word form, which was not audibly pronounced. In case of sandhi,
words have been written as they were heard, notes indicating how they
would appear in isolation. Words with free alternation of .X"" or ~ with

    difference that with the former, the no-process may also he combined with
    another process, that with -me; which does not occur with the nouns. See

l04 This is not the alternation with length of x or :) often found in other cases,
    such as, e.g., in e:kaxpa = e:ka:pa 'not bitten'. Here the vowel that
    preceded x remains short, unless it has to be long in accordance with some
    general mie of vocalic structure, see 2.1.3.
230                       THE CARIB LANGUAGE
Examples:
1) maina 'garden', mainana:no 'gardens in general, the whole complex
of gardens belonging to a village' ;
Z) pï:tï 'wife', pï:wa:no 'wives in general'.
With vowe1-altemation: e:tï 'name', otï:wa:no 'names in general'.
   The occurrenee of the suffix-alternants is partly determined by the
nature of the final phoneme: in notbus with a final nasal the formation
invariably takes place with -nano. E.g. tu:mufj 'mound', tu:muna:no
'mounds in general' ; uwe:tuij 'sleep', uwe:tuna:no 'sleep in general'
   Wi.th nouns ending in avowel both altemants occur. It is fairly
certain tJha,t their occurrence is connected with the vocalic structure
of the polymorphematic word: we find that -nano is always preceded
by a short vowel and -'ltla:no by a long vowel. Yet I have only partly
succeeded in finding a mie which, on the basis of the form of the
monomorphematic noun, predicts which of the two altematllts wilt
occur; viz. only for the dissyllabic nouns. In these (1) -nano occurs,
except when (Za) the noun belongs to the type which, when suffixation
occurs, shortens the first vowel and lengthens the second 105, or when
(lb) the noun loses its final syllable when suffixation takes place;
in the last two cases we find -wa:no.

30                          THE CARIB LANGUAGE
   In accordance with this central position of the word in all subsyste:ms
of language, the phonemes of chapter 1 are units that have as their
function the marking and distinguishing of wor d s, and their inven-
tory is made by seeking for oppositions by means of the comparison
of isolated words. No attempt has been made here to systematize the
phOlllemic inventory on the lines of ]akobson's general theory: a
conventional phonetic framework has been used. In one case however
- that of the nasal phonemes - it could he shown that adoption of
distinctive feature analysis will lead to a more satisfactory description
than the present one.
   In morphology, too, the fundanlental unit is the word: the classes
in chapter 3 are systems of categories of words, in which the words
take up their place according to their mutual forma:l/semantic opposi-
tions. Morphology heing conceived of in this way, the WP (word and
paradigm) style of morphological description 83 evidently is the most
suitable one. As rightly stressed by Robins, this type of grammatical
statement eau easily accommodate apr 0 ces s terminology ,84 while
on the other hand it also makes it possible to give due consideration
to the ent i tie s on which the processes ean operate. 85
   As was stated above, morphological eategorization started from
regular formal and semantic differences hetween words. N ow it has
become clear that in Carib - as in other languages - many regular
formal differenees are not restricted to words belonging to a few
categories, but ean be seen as resulting from more general regularities
that pervade the whole lexicon. Snch general rules have been described
separately, within the framework of a general discussion of the phone-
mie make-up of the Carib words, which is found in chapter 2. For
further particulars the reader is referred to the introductory sections
of the third and the second chapters (3.0., 2.0.).
   Problems properly pertaining to syntax, such as the formation of
word groups, had to he gone into at several points in chapters 2 and 3.
Iintend to devote a later publieation entirely to this subject.
   Finally, some transcriptions of tape-recorded material have been
added.","[49, 50]"
"    The personal prefixes may he regarded as exponents, which indicate
bath the starting-point and the aim of the action designated by the
verb, with regard to the speech event. As to the latter a distinction is
made hetween 1) the speaker, 2) the hearer, and 3) anything that is
neither speaker nor hearer. As can be seen from the first two columns
of the tabIe, there is one process, viz. IV, in which the action only
takes place between speaker and hearer; and this without it heing
expressed at which of the two ,the action is aimed and with whom it
originated: kïku:piya may be interpreted as 'you bath me' and as 'I bath
you'. In three categories (I, 11, 111) the action is directed at a person
who or thing which is neither speaker nor hearer, and proceeds from
speaker (I), hearer (11), or these two together (lIl); in three others
it, conversely, proceeds from a persoll who or a thing which is neither
speaker nor hearer, and is directed at speaker (V), hearer (VI), or4!l   vlIr occurs only in syntactic connection with a preceding word. We return
      to this in the present section.
162                        THE CARIB LANGUAGE
another person who or thing which is neither speaker nor hearer (VII).
 In VIII the personal distinctions are identicaJ with those of VII, with
this difference that the person at whom or the thing at which (being
 speaker nor hearer) the action is directed, is specified by a word
directly connected with the verb. It is not possible to use VIII except
 in connection with such a word, this in contrast to the members of
tbe categories I-VII, which may quite well occur as the only word-
cootent of asentence.
   In the verbs with I-VI the twofold personal indication is duplicated
by a twofold possibility of being syntactica1ly connected wi.th certain
other words or word-groups, which serve to make the persons or
thi,ngs involved in the action more explicit. Thus, e.g., siku:piya 'I bath
him' may he connected with au '1': au siku:piya 'it is I who bath him';
or wi.th :i)me 'my child': ï~me siku:piya 'I bath my child'. The two
words need not precede the verb: siku:piya au and siku:piya ï~me are
also possible. There is probably a tendency 10 place ï~me before the
verb and not to separate it from ,the verb by au, but I have not further
investigated this.
   With the verbs formed with VII (he/him) the situation is different
fromt!hat of the verbs formed with I-VI, in that only one of the two
possibilities of connection is present; viz. that with a word which
makes explicit the person from whom the action proceeds: VII ï~me
kïni:kttpi:ya'ij 'my child bathes him'.
   Finally as to the verbs with VIII, we have already seen that thc
situation is different from that found with I-VI, in that the person
at whom the action is directed mus t he made explicit by another
accompanying word. With regard to the person from whom the action
proceeds there is, as with I-VI, only the pos s i b i I i t Y of making
explicit, which need 110t he used.
Examples:
VIII moxko kari~na ene:ya'ij 'he saw the Indian',
VIII moxko kari~na ene:yatj moxko kuru:pi, or
VIII moxko kuru:pi moxko kari~na ene:yaij 'Kuru:pi saw the Indian'.
The word-group referring to the person from whom the aotion proceeds
(moxko' kuru :pi) may without any apparent semantic difference, be
placed both before and after the verb, see the above example. The
group ean never be placed, however, between the verb and the word
or group - always compulsorily present before the verb - which
makes explicit who undergoes the action (here: moxko kari~na).
                                   MORPHOLOGY                                 163  In what follows we shall see that VII and VIII complement each other
syntactically and semantically. In fact this is ,the strongest argument
for regarding VIII as an essential component of the system of personal
prefixatioo described here, so that it is reasonabie to assume the
existence of a personal zero prefix in VIII as a counterpar:t of the
other prefixes. Before this complementary character of VIII and VII
can be demonstrated, however, we must first discuss in some detail
the words and groups with which the verbs may he cormected. They
belong to five types:
A) Nouns (3.2.) and nomina! groups; e.g. i~me saro:ya 'I am taking
my child', mo:ro tapi:ret'j ta:ku'Wa saro:ya 'I am taking the red
polishing-stone' .
B) Proper names 43; e.g. Ya:nume:si ya:roya1J 'V. is taking me'.
C) No-formations on the basis of verbs (3.1.3.2.13.), postpositions
(3.3.1.4.) and adjectives (3.4.1.2.), and groups of which they form
part; e.g. ka:'Wono sako:to'ya 'I am cutting the high one' (sako:toya
'I am cuJtting it').
D) Verbal formations with -ri, ni-, -nCt'j, and -xpo (3.1.2.; 3.1.3.
2.3,4,8.), and groups of which they form part; e.g. aya:rorï supi:ya
'I cannot take you' (supi:ya 'I cannot'), ana:rorï sapoiya 'I seize what
you take' (sapoiya 'I seize it'), aya:roxpo sene:ya 'I see that you have
been taken' (sene:ya 'I see it').
E) The demonstratives discussed in 3.5.1., i.e. those that do not refer
to place or direction ; e.g. e:ro kïsa:roya 'both of us are taking this',
au ya:royaij 'he is taking me'.
   As might he expected, the words and groups mentioned sub A-E are
not indiscriminately suited for making explicit all personal distinctions:
   Where a lst person ('speaker') is present, he can he made explicit
by the demonstrative au 'I' (belonging to type E). A lst person is
found in I, IV and V.
   Where a 2nd person ('hearer') is present, he can he made explicit
by the demonstrative amo:ro 'you' (belonging to type E). A 2nd person
is found in 11, IV, VI.
   Where a Ist + 2nd person is present ('speaker' + 'hearer'), it can be
made explicit!: by the demonstrative kixko 'both of us' (belonging to
type E). A Ist + 2nd person is found in 111.
   Where a 3rd person is present ('anytl:hing that is neither speaker
43   In this study not discussed as a separate catagory or class, as they are not
     morphologically structured.
     164                             THE CARIB LANGUAGE
     nor hearer'), he or it can he made explicit by the other demonstratives
     mentioned sub E,44 and fu~thermore by all the words and groups men-
     tioned sub A-D. A 3rd person is found in I-In and V-VIJL
        As a result of these limita:tions it is in practically all cases unam-
    biguously clear whether the word or group connected with the verb
    makes explicit the person from whom the action proceeds, or the person
    at whom the action is directed. The following examples illustrate this
    for the categories formed with I-IJl, V, VI; pa:pa represents all the
    types of words and word-groups which can make a 3rd person explicit.
                                       word connected with verb
                                         refers to the person
     at whom                                        from whom
     the actioo is directed                         the action proceedsI    pa:pa saro::ya        I am taking father               it is I who am taking
                                                    au saro:ya
                                                            him
11 pa:pa maro:ya      you are taking father amo:ro maro:ya it is you who are taking
                                                            him
111 pa:pa kïsa:roya   both of us are taking kixko kïsa:roya it is both us who are
                      father                                taking him
V au ya:roya~         he is taking me       pa:pa ya:roya~ father is taking me
VI amo:ro aya:roj'a;j he is taking you      pa:pa aya:roya~ father is taking you      When each of the two persons is made explicit by a word or word
    group, it is still clear which of the two undergoes the a.d:ion and which
    performs the action:
    I au papa saro:ya or: pa:pa au saro:ya it is I who am taking father, etc.
      As far as I could discover it does not make any semantic difference
    whether it is au or pa:pa that precedes; there may, however, he a
    some difference in emphasis.
      Ambiguity does arise in the verbs formed with IV, but this ambi-
    guity also exists when such a verb is not connected with another word    44   They are o:tï 'something, what?', no:kï 'somebody, who?', c:nï 'this ooe here',
          mo:na 'that ooe over there', e:ro 'thi~ ooe with me', mo:ro 'that one,
         not with me', mo:se 'this living creature here', mo:ki 'that living crea-
         ture over there', moxko 'he', i:ro 'the thing referred to', ino:ro 'the living
         creature referred to'. Polymorphematic demonstratives (3.5.2.) generaUy
         perform their functioo of making explicit with the same personal categories
         as their monomorphematic counterparts. An exception in this respect is a:>na
         'we, excl. hearer'. Although this a:>na should probably he regarded as 'the
         plu ral of all 'I', it makes explicit not a lst pers. but a 3rd pers.: a~na kïni:-
         kupi:j'a~ (VII) 'we (excl.) bath him', a~na ku:piya;j (VIII) 'he bathes
         us (excl.)'.
                                      MORPHOLOGY                                 165or group. The only words that can serve to make persons explicit are
au '1' and amo:ro 'you':
IV au karo:ya          it is I who am tal<ing you / it is me you are taking
IV amo:ro karo:ya it is you I am taking / it is you who are taking me.
   The addition of au or amo:ro only gives some emphasis to the
reference to a Ist or Znd person. 45
   Finally, in VII and VIII we find two processes where the personal
exponent twice refers to the same person: the action proceeds from
a 3rd person and is directed at a(nother) 3rd person. In view of this,
ambigl.1ity might he expected to arise when a verb formed with VII or
VIII is connected with a word or grol.1p capable of making a 3rd person
explicit. Vet ambigl.1ity does not arise: in the first place, becal.1se in
VII only one of the two persons can he made explicit instead of ooth,
as is the case with the other processes; secondly, becal.1se in VIII one
of the persons has to he made explicit, and not just may he made
explicit, as is the case with other processes:                 action directed at                    action proceeding from
VII 3rd person, cannot he made explicit           3rd person. may he made explicit
VIII 3rd person, must he made explicit            3rd person, may he made explicit   It will now he c1ear th at VII and vIn complement each other: they
have the same personal exponent, but the latter is made explicit in
accordance with different mIes. Becal.1se of this complementary charac-
ter ambiguity does not arise, provided the verb is connected with not
more than one word or wordgroup.
Example:
VII moxko kari~na kine:neya1j the Indian sees him (moxko kari~na
                                   'the Indian')
VIII moxko kari~na ene:ya1j        he sees the Indian.
   When OOth persons are made explicit, a second factor operates, viz.
a ntle of word order. The verb, which in this case is always VIII,
is preceded by (A) the word or the grol.1p making explicit the person
at whom the action is directed,46 whereas (B) the word or the group45 Au amo:,-o karo:ya 'It is I who take you' is probably possible, too; I have
   not investigated this, however.
48 The verb VIII must always follow the word or the group with which it is
   connected, but need not follow it immediately. Separation is, for instanee.
   possible by naj>neJ3 'first': mme na~neJ3 klt:pi:l'a1J 'he first bathed his child'
 166                            THE CARIB LANGUAGE
 making explicit the person from whom the aotion proceeds may he
 placed either before or after the verb, provided it is not placed between
 (A) and the verb.
 Example:
 VnI moxko kuru:pi moxko kari~na ene:yaij or moxko kari~na ene:yafJ
        moxko kuru:pi Kuru:pi saw the Indian (moxko kuru:pi 'Kuru:pi',
        moxko kari~na 'the Indian').
 I have not been able to ascertain whether the different position of the
group moxko kuru:pi involves any semantic difference.
   Finally we return to the description, given at the beginning of this
seotion, of the verbs of type VnI as the product of personal prefixation,
with a prefix ,that is invariably zero, irrespective of the nature of the
initial phon:eme of the monomorphematic verb. 47
Two arguments ean now he put forward in favour of such an analysis:
(1) In these verbs a personal exponent is clearly present: '3rd person
as starting-point of the action'. As this personal exponent neirther
belongs to the monomorphematic base, nor is contributed by the
tempol'alf./modal suffixing-process, it is reasonabie to assume the ex-
istence of a zero-prefix as its bearer.
(2) The assumption that the verbs of type VnI have a place in the
system of personal prefixations is now oonfirmed by their relation to
vn described above: both vn and VIn have sueh synJtactic and
semantic properties as to complement eaeh other.","[181, 182, 183, 184, 185, 186]"

    We find the same sifuation for the third suffix-alternat1il: -re. It is
 found with all nouns in which the transitive transposition takes place
 by means of -ro, but also with some others. Examples of -ro and -re:

 'provided with drawing'; owaxpo 'caImness, kindness', ewaxporo 'to

'given to lying, mendacious'.
   In cases other than those so far mentioned, alternant 1) occurs; e.g.
mauru 'cotton', tïmauruke 'provided with cotrt:on'; ye:rï 'tooth, sharp-
ness', tïye:ke 'with teeth, sharp'; 'wa:re 'song', tuwa:reke 'knowing

   An exception is formed, however, by five nouns in which trans-
position takes place in a very different way, viz. without prefixatiol1,
only with suffixation. Four have -pe, one has -me. They are: panaxtori
'strength', panaxpe 'strong' ; parixtorï 'violence', parixpe 'violent','
yafjsikï:rï 'depth', ya~si:pe 'deep'; mo:si~ 'leng;th', mo:si:pe 'long';
sa:ni~ 'shortness', sa:ni:me 'short'.
   In this caJt:egory, too, affixation is in many cases accompanied by
reduction of the noun, in the process of which the final syUables ti,
ki, ku, ri, rtt, ni or nu often, but not always, disappear, without it
being possible to formulate a rule for this. It also happens that a
particular noun undergoes reduction in one process and not in another.
A list of these discrepancies is given here, but it is no doubt in-
complete. The matter needs further investigation. The enumeration
given in 3.2.2.3. serves as a basis.
a) Nouns that are reduced in the negation-category (with -xp a or
-~ma) and in the transposition-categories as weU.
Example:
ï:potï 'hair, feathers on body'; i:po:rpa, ï:poxto, tï:poke.
b) N OUI1S that are not reduced in Ithe negation-category and not in
the transposition-categories either.

c) Nouns that are not reduced in the negation-category, but are in the

do not indicate that a particular form does not exist, but only that it
is lacking in my material.

tion only takes place in the adjectival transposition:

category may he defined as foIlows: 'having what is designa.ted by the
monomorphematic noun, as a possession, quality, outward characteristic,
social relation'. E.g.:
tïpï:ra:take 'possessing money', tïpïike 'shy, ashamed', tïpi:pake 'as
flat as the frog pipa', tomïirïne 'having a daughter'.","[262, 263, 264, 265]"
"  The picture of unity from a semantic poiI1Jt: of view is hardly dis-
turbed by those cases where two different altemants were found to
occur with one and the same noun. In the first place there is no
apparentsemantic difference between some of these doublets:
2) aku:tuma     4) aku:tuno     to cause to hecome turbid, doudy (a)
1) puruxsaixto 3) puruxsaika to adze with the long ooze (d)
7) ka:muro      3) ka:muka      to cause to fJare up (b)
8) a.si:woko    3) a.si:woka    to satiate (a)
1) ïiyo:rto    10) iiyopa       to give a husband (c)
  Furthermore, among the cases that do show differentiation there
are two in which it does not lie in the semantic aspect of the suffix es,
but in that of the noun which serves as base for the formation:
 240                       THE CARIB LANGUAGE
  1) e:maxto 'to cut out a path for someone, or for a boat so as to
 drag it to the water' (c), 3) e:maka 'to comb a parting in somebody's
 hair' (c);
 1) wepandaxto 'te grow a branch', said of a .tree (b), 3) woxpandaka
 'to branch, to flow together', said of rivers (b).
    In the second doublet, on the basis of panda 'branch', the we-process
 has been applied after transposition, which gives the resulting verbs
 an intransi.tive, reflexive charaoter. It is remarkable that, whereas -xlo
 is combined with the reglllar altemant we-, -ka in this case is combined
 with wox-, an altemanit which is confined to very few verbs (3.1.3.1.1.).
 This would seem to support the assumption that -ka is no longer
 productive.
    Thus only five doublets remain in which the suffixes seem to be
 semantically differentiated. In four of them the difference may he one
 between (c) 'to give, to provide with 5Omething', and (a) 'to cause to
 become':
 2) aiku:ma 'to add a liquid to something', i.e. water, to msped cas-
 sava in makillg beer (c), 1) aikuxto 'to make liquid by lrneading', e.g.
 berries (a) ;
2) karaima 'to blacken', viz. the backs of the hands by applying black
pigment to them (c ), 7) ka:rairo 'to cause to become d:a.rk in colour',
viz. the sun tans the skin (a);
2) ku:yuma 'to make brownish-red', viz. the feet by applying red
pigment to them (c), 7) ku:yuro ',to cause to become yellowish-brown',
viz. bread by baking it (a);
9) rando 'to provide with a floor of boards' (c), 3) ra:ka 'to cause
something to get a flat surface', viz. a tree by splitting it (a).
   I am not quite certain that the differentiation is really fixed in these
cases, '50 that it would be impossible for a and c to be interchanged;
this would need further invest:igation.
   Finally there is a doublet which seems to be complete1y i5Olated:
2) epe:ma 'to pay for 5Omething, to take revenge for something' (c),
epe:kati 'to buy something' (d ?).","[259, 260]"
"3.1.3.2.11.     The me-category
    The me-process can only occur in combination with the topo-process
  (3.1.3.2.7.). Suffix -me is placed after the suffix of the topo-process.
 In rthis laJIlter suffix, the syllable po is reduced before -me; it is replacecl
 by ~ (see also 3.1.3.2.9D.).
 Examples:
 paxkato:po 'opportunity for ,taking outside', paxkato~me 'in order to
 take outside'; weitopo 'way of being', weito~me 'in order to be in a
 certain way, so that - might be in that way'.
    The meaning of the members of the me-category may be defined as:
 'in order to perfoml the part of what is designated by the corresponding
 topo-fommtion' .
Examples:
ori:no u:nato:po 'implement for sieving day, sieve for cIay', ori:no
u:nato~me e:ro sima:ri sika:sa 'I make this sieve in order to sieve day'
 (ori:no 'day', u:na 'to sieve', e:ro sima:ri sika:sa 'I make this sieve') ;
merki a:ripa,xtopo 'place for, means of, distributing mi Ik', merki a:ri-
pax8o~me i:ke aka:wana:ï a:tïya:tofJ 'in order to distribute milk with it,
they are rinsing out a tin' (i:ke 'wÏith it', aka:wana:ï 'tin', a:tïya:tofj
'they are rinsing'); weitopo 'place, way of being, of becoming', tïpa:-
tïmï epi:no:safJJ ko:i po:tome ino:ro weito~me 'he treated his sister's
child with herbs so that it might gei big 5Oon' (tïpa:tïmï epi:no:safj
'he tre3lted his sister's child with herbs', ko:i 'soon', po:tome 'big', ino:ro
'the one referred to').
    It is to be noted thai what has been described as a suffixed -me is
bdth semantically and morphologicaIly similar 10 a certain word, the
postposition me 'as, when',21 50 that one cannot but wonder whether21   Both the formations with suffixed -me, and the postposition me form their
     plural with -ne and diphthongisation (meine, see below 3.1.3.2.14. paradigm
     VII, and 3.3.5.); and both form a no-formation with -'! and vowel change
     (3.1.3.2.14. paradigm IX, and 3.3.4.).
                                    MORPHOLOGY                                   145me in the type pa..-rkato~me is not identieal with this word me. For that
 matter, the reverse possibility deserves oonsideration, too: is not it
possible that in other cases where combination of a verbal fonn with
this postposition me is assumed 22 we rea11y have to do with a suffixed
-me, just as in pa:rkato~me?
   A c1ear distinction between word and suffix is made difficult in
this case because me, like all other non-prefixed postpositions, always
has to immediately follow the word with which it is connected and
thus resembles a suffix in this respect.23 AIthough there are, it seems
to me, three arguments against the altemative inrt:erpretations mentioned
above, I would certainly not exclude the possibility that, when more
facts have come to light, a more satisfactory analysis may be put
forward than the one given here.
I) On the whole there is no reason to regard me following a verbal
form as anything other than the postposition me, because replacement
by other poSitpositions is possible; e.g. ke 'with': aembo mo..-rko we:i:po
me 'when he had finished', aembo mo..-rko we:i:po ke 'because he had
finished.'.
2) Only in the formation of the type pa..-rkato~me on the basis of pax-
kato:po does the phenomenon of reduction clearly indicate that -me is
a part of a word and not a word. Nor is replacement of this -me by a
postposition possible.
3) The members of the topo-caregory ean also be combined with me
without red.uction occurring, and in this ease it is natural to regard
me as a postposition. It is not certain whether the thus-formed groups
differ sernantically from the corresponding formations with -me and
reduction. Perhaps such a difference may he found in the following
cases - the only ones in my material - where with the same verbal22 This is the case with the formations with -ri (3.1.2.1.), with -:rpo (3.1.3.2.4.),
   with -:rto (3.1.3.2.5.), and with -lIeJJ (3.1.3.2.8.). Examples:
   1) am wo:)'a~ tïna:rori me 'he killed one, as something that was taken by
   him' (i.e. as food for his journey; am wo: J'a~ 'he killed one'); 2) aembo
   tuwe:i:po me ro kinï:rsa~ nona:pa 'as soon as he was ready he set off again'
    (aembo 'ready', we:i 'to be, become', tu- '3rd pers. refl.', ro 'indeed, quite,
   straightway', kinï:rsa~ nOlla:pa 'he set oH again'); 3) mo:rka:ro pita:ni
   ne:ne:rtorï me ta:ro ma~ 'whiIe the children could not watch her, she was
   abducted' (mo:rka:ro pita:ni 'the children', c:lle 'to see, wateh', ta:ro ma;)
   'she was taken, abducted'); 4) kerki ene:/u13 me tï::ye ma?) 'he has been
   appointed verger' (kerki 'church', ti:)'e ma~ 'he has been appointed').
23 What it lacks is the separability with regard to other words which is
   characteristic of words, in contrast to parts of words. For the reason for
   regarding, despite this, postpositions as words and not as suffixes, see 3.3.1.

 fonnation with -topo, suffix -me and reductioo occur:

 c) wo:t1o pi:nato~me      in order to get fish.
 In OOth cases the group wi<th postposition seems to he hetter suited
 to refer to material means serving the activity, while the fonnation
 with -me seems to have a more general-final meaning; this needs
 further investiga<tion, however, before areliabIe conclusion is possible.","[164, 165, 166]"
"Exarnples:
1) auxto 'house',         auxtombo 'dilapidated house',
2) aura~ 'story',         auranïmbo 'old, fornler story'.
   In a small numher of rases a formation with -po was found alongside
the one wi.tb -mbo, without any apparent semantic difference. The
words in question are: mari:ya 'knife', mari:yapo 'old knife'; to:ri
'story', to:ripo 'old story, strange story'; pa:M 'ear, sting at the side
of tbe head of a fish', pa:napo 'loose sting, of a fish that has been
eaten'; ï:potï 'hair on body, feathers', ï:popo 'plucked hair, feathers';
maina 'garden', mainapo 'former garden'; ï~muru 'son', Pmu:po 94 'SOI1
whose father is dead'; andïkï:rï 'tail', andïkï:po 'tail-piece (meat)'.94
In all these cases regular -mbo rnay also occur, and moreover -po and
-mbo may he used together, again without any semantic difference:
marï:yapombo 'old knife', ï:popombo 'plucked hair, featbers'; andïkï:-
pombo 'tail-piece'.
   The latter does not apply to ku:pesi:ni po:ripo 'non-genuine branch
94   Before -po the final syllable is lost. As we shall see, this phenomenon also
     occurs in other suffixations than -po; not however with its regular counter-
     part -mbo: ï~mllrllmbo Iikewise meaning 'son whose father is dead'.

 invariably find -po, not -mbo or -pombo (po:rirï = 'branch').95
   The meaning of the members of the category may be defined as:
 'what is designated by the monomorphematic noun, applied by the
 speaker with some reserve because of the existence of a discrepancy
 with regard to the real state of affairs'.
   The discrepancy may be of various kinds: I. The noun used was at one time fuUy applicable to the thing in
question, but is so no longer. This temporal discrepan.cy may be ex-
pressed by terms like (A) 'formerly, at one time, originally'; other
cases, which may be rendered by (B) 'known for ages, you know what
I mean', probably also belong to this temporal interpretation of -mbo.
Examples:
A) paru:ru e:pïmbo aro:yalJ 'he took with him something that used to
he the stem of a banana-tree' (but has now been cut down and stripped
of its leaves; paru:ru 'banana', e:pï 'stem') ;

 186                           THE CARIB LANGUAGE
     All interrogative verbs have now been fully described formally, and
  this in terms of the modifications which the memhers of the non-
  interrogative categories have to undergo so as to produce the inter-
  rogative verbs. The formation of the interrogative verbs may, however,
  be approached from a compietely different angle. When discussing the
  temporal/modal and personal processes in 3.1.3.3.1. and 2., we found
  in a numher of cases an alternation of affixes which did not depend
  on the form. of the monomorphematic verb but was detemlined mor-
  phologically only. This kind of alternation was found to occur:
  1) In the ya- and the take-process (3.1.3.3.2.1. and 2.); where the
  alternants -ya, -sa, -eo -fake occur in the case of combination with the
 personal processes I-IV (transitive verbs) and 1-3 (intransitive verbs),
  while other altemants: -yaij. -sa~. -:no, -taij occur in the case of
 combination with the personal processes V-VIII (transitive verbs)
 and 4 (intransitive verbs).
 2) In the personal prooess VII (transitive verbs) and the personal
 process 4 (intransitive verbs); where the alternants kïni:- or kïn-
 occur in combination with the temporal/modal processes with -ya, -take,
 -yakof), -yaine, -1'3 (3.1.3.3.2.), while the alternants ni- or n- occur
 in combination with the processes with diphthongisation, -:se or -rï. 63
    Now the interrogative verbs may all he regarded as products of the
 non-applic:a:bility of these two rul es, the altemants -ya, -sa, -e, -take,
 kïni:- and kin- heing replaced by their co-altemants -yaij, -saij, -:no,
 -ta1j, ni- and n-. Where the latter are already present in accordance with
the rules applying to non-interrogative verbs, the possibility to form
interrogative verbs is lacking.
    As to ,the semantic value of the process the following may he noted.
On the whole it is well characterised by the term 'interrogative', but
th ere are two types of cases for which this is not entirely correct.
a) Without th ere being anything like a question, the imerrogative
fOffilations are invariably used in syntactic combination with ti:ro 'it
is said, it seems that', and o:ro 'let, may'; e.g. kari~na ti:ro no:saij 'it
seems that people are coming' (no:saij on the basis of wo:pï 'to come',
with ya-process and n- instead of kïn-) ; and the answer: o:ro no~ne7j
'Iet them come' (no~ne7j on the basis of wo:pï, with 1'3-process and n-
instead of kïn-).
b) Interrogative formations may he used in a modest or reservedua   There is a third alternant: zero. used in combination with -to (3.1.3.3.Z.5.).
     This zero-alternant, however, plays no part in the interr<>gative verbs.

i.e. 'not too badly' (yu~pa 'well', paina,re 'perhaps', weitaij on the basis
of we:i 'to he, become', with -taf] instead of -take).
   Although 1 have only come across this use of interrogative verbs in
polite phrases like the one cirted, it seems not impossible to me that
they may he used in other cases where the speaker wants to avoid
making a definite statement.","[205, 206, 207]"
"35 And perhaps with the mbo-process, but I have not gone into this.
38 The alternant -}no;j for the plural corresponds, with the exception of the ~,
   to the -nofj for the plural of certain adjectives, see 3.4.3.
37 1 have not ascertained the possibility of cornbination with -mbo, mi-, and
   repeated combination with -ne (above, VII).

ni-category and the categories formed by combination of ni-, -xpo and
-xto are lacking.
II. Besides ni-, -netj cannot he applied either, while -xpa in the case of
intransitive verbs cannot he combined with personal prefixation. Thus
the following formations are left:                                            (b)                   (c)

personal prefixation is possible with intransitive verbs, too, but the
plu ral process can only he applied in one way: in direct combination
with the topo-process, and not also in direct combination with the
me-process. Again, g marks the plural process (here represented by
the alternant -koJJ only), and h represents the me-process:

transitive and intransitive verbs.","[175, 176, 177]"
"It should he noted, however, that the negation-process with -xpa,
although it occurs singly with all verbs, ean he combined with a per-
sonal prefix only in the case of transitive verbs. Both the ni- and the
ne9j-process are wholly confined to transitive verbs. All these affixa-
tions, both personal and non-personal, ean also occur singly. We shall
see that some of the seven non-personal affixations can also he eom-
bined with each other.
  Together with some of the processes, further affixation is possible:
personal processes exeept Ist person, and the non-personal ones, ex-
cept -mbo, may he eombined with

  In the processes enumerated above numerous alternation-phenomena
 116                          THE CARIB LANGUAGE
 occur. Sometimes the detennining factor is found in the further mor-
 phological structure of the word; thus, for instance the interrogative
 caltegory of the Ist and 2nd persons is fonned by means of suffixing,
 but that of the 3rd person by prefixing. More often the alternation is
 detennined by the form of the base. The rules tha.t obtain in such
 cases pertain to the nature of initial or final phonemes, while the
 reduction of the final syllables pï, (i, kï, mï, rïJ ku and ru as aresult
 of suffixation, discussed in the chapter on morphonology, is also in
 many cases attended by the occurrence of a special suffix-alternant
 (2.1.1.1.1B2.).
   Besides these special alternaJtions, which are confined to certain
eategories, widespread altemation occurs as a result of the general
rules of word structure, which were discussed in chapter 2. Of special
importance are the mIes distributing long and short vowels, in ac-
cordance with a limited numher of patterns, over the word-fonn (2.1.3.
and 2.2.3.). Except in special cases, such genera! rules will not he
mentioned again in the present chapter ; they may he found in chapter 2.","[133, 134, 135, 136]"

    As was noted at the beginning of this section, many nouns lack the
 distinction between a syntactic A- and B-category. Thus we find along-
 side exkïinï se:nei 'I have really seen smoke', waxto exkïini se:nei
 'I have really seen the smoke of the fire', with the same form exkïinï,
 without ,.ï or vowel-alternation.
    I have not completely succeeded in fom1Ulating rules for the oc-
currence or non-occurrence of the formation of syntaotic categories.
 This may be due to the fact that my investigation was not thorough
 enough, but I believe that there is in fact no complete regularity in
 this matter.
    In sa far as it is possible to detect regularity, it lies in the faet that
 (1) there is no formation of syntaotic categories in the great majority
of nouns ending in ï. There are, however, (2) also noons in ï where
syntactic categories are foond, and conversely (3) nouns ending in
avowel other than ï or in a nasal where they are not found. I have
 not succeeded in finding any mIe enabling one to prc<liot whether a
noun belongs to 1, 2 or 3.
 1) Examples of nouns in ï withOUJt syntactic categories: emexpï 'fore-
head', koxfi 'ery', e:kï 'pet animaI', wo:mi 'garment', ye:ni 'storage,
packing', ttnài 'treetmnk', wokï:rï 'man', ekï:ri 'thorn', isu~Wi 'lath,
split palm rib'.
2) The cases in my material en ding in ij with syntactic categories:
o:ti/o:firï 'thing', po:tï/po:firï 'upper lip', re:tï/re:tïrï 'top', ore:kï/
ere:kïrï 'wOUl1d', pï:mï/Pi:mïrï 'neck', ta:mï/ta:miiri 'tobacco'.
3a) The cases in my m.a.terial ending in avowel other than ij without
syntactic categories: epïxpo 'pip, seed', pi:po 'skin, bark', turu:po
'heart', ttpuxpo 'head', ye:po 'bone'; 90 ako:no 'friend' (male or female),
ektt:ntt 'waist', pll:nu 'flesh', ï~me 'child', ï~mo 'egg', Pmuru 'son',
ïmba 'shoulder-blade', ïiyo 'husband', uwembo 'helly'.
3b) The cases in my material en ding in a nasal, wÎJthout syntactic~o   As against these 5 cases in po that are not suffixed with -ri, there are two
     where this does happen: tllxPO/lllxpori 'spoon', wïrï:po/wï:rïpo:ri 'sweepings'.
                                      MORPHOLOGY                                    219categories: auraij 'language, speech', uwe:s~ 'backside', awo:St1J
'weight, heaviness', ema:miij 'work', po:siij 'sweetness', apoxtufj 'right-
 hand side', a:tufj 'fever', tu:muij 'mound', uwe:tuij 'sleepiness', ya:>muij
 'body', yextuij 'illness, pain'.
    In fact these 11 cases constitute the greater part of the very lim-
 ited 91 material with a final nasal; I know of only 7 cases where the
syntactic cattegories do occur: su:rabaij j su :raba:nï 'beam of roof',
skeijjske:nï 'body', tefj/te:nï 'time', a:sifJja:si:nï 'heat', mo':siijjmo:si:nï
'length' , sa:niij j sa:ni:nï 'shortness', e :mt}j e :randï 'watchman'.
    Finally, i:tuji:turu 'forest' is an isolated case, since the presence
or absence of ru has nothing to elo with a difference in syntactic
valence: both fom1s are syntacticaIly and semantically fully inter-
changeable.","[238, 239]"
"3.1.3.5.1.     The tï-category
   Serving as base for the tï-process are the members of the syntactie
se-category (3.1.2.1.), where it is present. V/hen such a syntactie se-
formaJtion is lacking, the monomorphematic verb as such serves as base
for the t'i-process.
   The following prefix-altemants occur:
 1) tï-
2) tu-
3) t-
   The first is the case when the monomorphematic verb begins with
a con·sonant other than w, the second when it begins with w, and the
third when it begins with avowel.
Examples, verbs with syntactic se-category:
1) ka:pïlka:se 'to make', tïka:se 'made'; po:mïlPoiye 'to plant', t'ipoiye
'plal1lted' ;
196                           THE CARIB LANGUAGE
 2) we:i/weiye 'to become', tuweiye 'having become';
 3) ï:rï/ï:ye 'to give, place', tï:ye 'given, placed'; ambo:tï/ambo:se 'to
 break' (trans.), tambo:se 'broken' ; apo:i/apoiye 'to seize, hold', tapoiye
 'seized'.
 Examples, verbs without syntactic se-category:
 1) ku:pi 'to bath', tïku:pi 'bathed'; tunda 'to arrive', tïtunda 'arrived';
 2) wo:ma 'to fight against', tuwo:ma 'fought against'; waipï:na 'to
 stand together', tuwaipï:na 'having stood together' ;
 3) a:ro 'to take (with you)', ta:ro 'taken'; atï:ta 'to grow', tatï:ta
 'having grown'.
    After t-, an initial vowel e or e: is replaced by 0, 0:.
 Examples:
 3) e:ne 'to see', to:ne 'seen' ; ere~na 'to faint', torûna 'fainted'.
    In three cases the formation is not in accordance with the rules
given above.
    With wo 'to strike, kill' prefixation occurs not in accordance with 2,
but in acordance with I: tï:wo 'struck, killed'.70
    With wï:ka 'to speak' and wï:to 'to go' prefixation occurs not in
accordance with 2, but in accordance with 3, the prefix t- replacing w:
tï:ka 'having spoken', tï:to 'gone'.
    The meaning of the members of the category may he defined as
'having undergone (transitive verbs) or having performed (intransitive
verbs) the action designated by the corresponding monomorphematic
verb'.
Examples:
moxko pita:ni tïku:pi tera:pa ma1j 'the child has already been bathed',
 (moxko pita:ni 'the child', ku:pi 'to bath', tera:pa 'already', ma1j 'he
 is'); ye:mïirï tuta:se ma1j 'my daughter is lost, has lost her way'
(ye:mïirï 'my daughter', uta:pï 'to get lost, lose one's way', ma1j 'she is').
   The verbs with tï- were found (a) directIy connected with one of
the members of the defective paradigm ma~ 'he, she, it is', ma:na 'you
are', wa 'I am', kïna:koij 'he, it was', etc. (see 3.1.4.); (b) in direct
connection with we:i ''10 he, beoome', wo:pï 'to come', wï:to 'to go', or
a derivation from one of these verbs, (c) in direct conneotion with
the conditional postposition axta, (d) without one of the above words70   It is possible that the deviant behaviour of 'wo is connected with the mono-
     syllabic word-structure. It should he noted that also in the formation of the
     reflexive personal category (see 3.1.3.2.1,) wo is provided with an alternant
     tï- while otherwise tu- is a1ways used before w-.
                                   MORPHOLOGY                                 197  being present, but in th is case I have not found any semantic difference
  from a groop which would arise if the form ma1j 'he, she, it is',
  mentioned sub (a), was added. The word with tï- invariably precedes
  the word directly connected with it, but need not precede it inunediately.
  Examples:
  a) tuta:se ma1j 'she has lost her way', tuta:se wa 'I have lost my way',
  to:ne ma:na 'you have been seen';
  b) tuta:se me:i 'you have really lost yom way' (me:i optative/
 affirmative Znd pers. to we:i), toka:nuiye kïnoxsa1j 'he comes running'
  (eka:numï 'to run', kïnoxsaij 'he comes), am anuiye toka:nuiye mïxsa
 'you go to pick up a coupie, running' (am anuiye 'to pick up a coupie',
 mïxsa 'you go') ;
 c) tuwo:tapoiye tera:pa axtaine 'as they had already taken each other',
  (tcra:pa 'already', axtaine 'as they') ;
 d) ani po:to ixpori:rï ihva tïpa:to 'a big creek has been crossed by
 him' (am po:to ixpori:rï 'a big creek', i~wa 'by him', pa:to 'to cross').
 Thc semantic content of the sentence remains the same, as far as I
 could ten, when ma1j 'he, it is' is added after tïpa:to. In my text-material
 cases without maij are rare.
    I do not know whether, apart from the verbs mentioned under a, b
 abOove and axtla, any other verbs and postpositions may be connected
 with the members of the tï-category. On the basis Oof my material it
 would seem that the constructions with maij and we:i are much more
frequently used than those with the other verbs and axta.
    As the examples cited showed, .the word connected with a member
of the tï-category gives, by means of its personal exponent, an indication
 with ~rd to the person involved in the action. In the case of
intransitive verbs it is the person from whom the action proceeds, in
the case of transitives it is the person al\: whom the action is directed.
In order to indicate the performer of the action, too, in a transitive
tï-fom1ation, use may be made of a group with the postposition ~wa
'to, by', or of a personal derivation from this postposition: ï~muru
~wa tïka:se ma1j 'it has been made by my son' (ï~muru 'my son', ka:pï
'to make'), i~'wa tïka:se maij 'it is has been made by him'.","[215, 216, 217]"

1.1.1.4. FINAL REMARKS

phenomenon here referred to as palatalization and the phonetic phe-

within each pair of allophones is not always entirely the same. The
following types ean he distinguished.
1) The palatalized allophone phonetically consists of two segments,
the second of which is a laminal off-glide: unvoiced in pY, t Y, voiced
and frictionless in br , d"", m r , w Y, voiced with friction in di.
2) The palatalized allophone is phonetically one segment. In this type
the following differences are found:
a) As compared with the non-palatalized allophone a complete shift has
taken place to another zone of articulation; from tongue tip to blade:
ii; from dorsum to blade: c; or from dorsum to centre: ;!.'.
b) There is no such complete shift in the case of Is I. Both allophones,
hissing s and hushing s, are articulated with the blade; in s, however,
the cent re of the tongue is raised.
c) In the case of Iyl the articulations of OOth allophones, y and j,
are completely homorganic; the only difference between them is that
there is friction in j, whereas there is none in y.
                                       PHONOLOGY                                     43     The tenn palatalization as used in phonetics cannot be applied to
  each of these types. In phonetic tenns palatalization is only a special
  fonn of co-articulation: ""any except a frontal (palatal) sound can be
  accompanied by a raising of the front toward the hard palate"" ; 17 only
  the allophones of our type 1) come under this heading. In those of
  type 2) it is not a matter of a sound being modified by a second
  Sltricture occurring simultaneously with the primary articulation, but
 of a simple articulation (e.g. k) being replaced by another (e.g. c).
     This does not alter the fact, however, that the phonetic processes
 that give rise to the allophanes of type 1) and those of the types 2a)
 and Zb) have clearly much in common. In all these th ree types we
 have allophones occurring after i which from an articulatory point of
 view are closer to i than their partners. This does not, however, apply
 ta I y I. In tthis case the ""palatalized"" allophone, the fricative j, happens
 to differ more from i than its partner, the semivowe1 y. It may be
 asked whether, in view of this striking phonetic disparity - on the
 one hand a shift to the i-position, on rthe other a change away from
 it - it would not have been better ,to treat the allophonic situation in
 the case of I y land that in the case of the other consonants separately.
    In my opinion, however, this disparity is not sufficient reason to
question the phonologica1 unity of the phenomenon, the more so as this
 unity is confirmed by the rules which we found in 1.1.1.2. There we
have seen that in the case of ,Iyl these rttles are different from wh at
holds good for the large majoritty of consonants, but it is precise1y in
these differences that they are in complete agreement with the rules
for Irl, one of the phonemes subject to palatalizatian, as the term
is understood in phonetics.
    Maintaining the phonological unity of the phonetically heterogeneous
fanns of i-allophonics, we need a tenn for the phonological phe-
nomenon. I have retained the ,term palatalizatioll, despite the fact that
in its phonetic sense it is not applicable to the i-a1lophonics of all the
phonemes.","[61, 62, 63]"
"2.. This is not the free alternation of x with length often found in other cases,
   such as e.g. e:maxpa = e:ma:pa 'without a path'. Here the vowel that
   preoeded x remains short, unless it has to he long in accordance with some
   genera! rule of vocalic structure, see 2.1.3.

   The no-process can also he applied to monomorphematic postpositions
 (3.3.4.) and adjectives (3.4.2.), so that the question arises as to
whether in the suffixation with -.-cpa or -me transposition to one of
these other systems has taken place. Transposition to the adjectives
is out of the question, as they lack the personal prefixture and plural
suffixation characteristic of the xpa- and me-formations (see 3.1.3.2.14.
paradigm IX). The postpositions do, however, possess these processes
 (3.3.2."" 3.3,5), so that there is no denying that they are mor-
phologically similar to the xpa- and me-formations. There is, however,
a difference: the postpositions lack the mï-process (see 3.1.3.2.12.,
above), while the xpa- and me-formations lack the as-process which is
a produotive one with the postpositions (3.3.3.). Semantically, too,
the two verbal categories and the postpositions seem to have HttJe in
common. For these reasons lassurne that no transposition has taken
place in this case.","[167, 168]"
"3.1.3.2.9.   The ne-categories
   The ne-process, by means of which plurals are formed, cannot be
directly applied to monomorphematic verbs. It may only occur in com-
bination with the following processes discussed above: A) the personal
processes, except that of the first person (3.1.3.2.1.), B) the one with
 142                          TUE CARIB LANGUAGE
  -xpa (3.1.3.2.6.), C) the one with ni- (3.1.3.2.3.), D) the one with
 -topo (3.1.3.2.7.), E) the one with -net'J (3.1.3.2.8.), F) the Oone wi,th
 -xpo (3.1.3.2.4.). I have not gone intOo the question as tOo whether
 combinatioo with the xto-process (3.1.3.2.5.) is possible; definitely
 impossible, however, is combinatiOon with first person and with the
 mbo-process (3.1.3.2.2.).
    When the ne-process is combine<! with the other processes, a number
 of very different alternants occur. In the discussion below categories
 which have the same plural-alternant are kept together; for tJhis reason
 there is some deviation from the order in 3.1.3.2.1-8.
 A) In the case of combinatioo with a personal process, suffixation
 with -ne occurs. Before -ne, the final vowel of the monomorphemart:ic
 verb is replaced by the corresponding i-diphthong, unless this final
 vowel is i.
Examples:
 1) aya:ro your being taken aya:roine your (plur.)             being taken
    a:ro     his     ""      ""    aroine     their                """"
    ta:ro    his own ""     ""     ta:roine their own              """"
    ka:ro OOth our ,,'     ""     ka:roine our (incl. hearer) ""         ""
2) ayu:pi your being looked ayu:pine your (plur.) being looked
    etc.     for                 etc.       fOor
Wiillh the 200, 3rd and reflexive 3rd person the ne-formation is used
when the number of persons referred to by the prefix is two or mOore,
while with the Ist + 2nd person ('OOth of us') this number is three
Oor more, because either the speaker, or the hearer, Oor OOth are inc1uded
in a group comprising two Oor more persOons. 20
B) Also in '!he case of combination with the xpa-process, there is
suffixation with -ne, and replacement Oof the final a in -xpa by the
corresponding i-diphthong, ai.
Examples:
ika:pïxpa 'not made', ika:pïxpaine no:ro mando~ 'they have not yet
been made' (no:ro 'yet' , mando~ 'they are'); c:ixpa 'not becOome, not
ripe', e:ixpaine no:ro mandoij 'they are not ripe yet'.
C) In the case of combination with the ni-process, the a1ternant -koiJ
occurs.
Example:20   An excluding 'our' can only be expressed with the aid of the demonstrative
     li}na; a~na a:ro 'our, excl. hearer, being taken'.
                                MORPHOLOGY                             143moxko pa:mï na:rorï se wa 'I want it to be taken by (my) brother-in-
law, I want what is taken by (my) brother-in-law'; moxko pa:mï
no:rorï:koij se wa 'I want them to be taken by (my) brother-in-law,
I want the things taken by (my) brother-in-law' (a:ro 'to take).
D) Also in the case of combination wi,th the topo-process, the altenlant
-koij occurs, placed after -topo. Before the suffix, the syllable po in
-topo is reduced in the same way as regularly happens to final pï, tï
and other syllabi es in monomorphematic verbs (see 2.1.1.1.1 B2.). The
loss of po is compensated for by ,the insertion of .l'.
Exanlples:
u:nato:po 'sieve', u:natoxkoij 'sieves'; 'weitopo 'way of being, dwelling-
place', weitoxkoij 'ways of being, dwe11ing-places'.
  Reduction of po in -topo is also found in the case of combination
with the me-process; see below, 3.1.3.2.11.
E) In the case of combination with the ne1J-process the alternant -moij
is placed after the other suffix. Before the plural suffix, e'} in -ne'} is
replaced by a:.
Example:
wo:ne1J 'murderer', wo:na:moij 'murderers'.
F) In the case of combination with the xpo-process, the alternant -saij
occurs. This suffix replaces po.
Examples:
noxpo 'the being left behind of one person, a person who has been left
behind', noxsaij 'id., plur.'; ttxtaxpo 'some:thing that has emerged,
sandbank', uxtaxsa.ij 'id., plur.'.","[161, 162, 163]"
"   Let us now consider, first (I) the temporally urunarked, non-inter-
rogative verbs with their plural correlates ; next (rI) the preterites
and (rIl) the interrogative verbs.
I. The plurals in the right-hand column are formed by means of
-:toi] or, after a nasal, -dofj, which alternant occurs with the regular
verbs as well (3.1.3.3.3.1A-C.). The absence of a plural lst pers. is
also in accordance with what is invariably found in the regular verbs.
As to the personal distinctions, the replacement of w by m- (Znd pers.)
and by kït- (1 st + Znd pers.) is in accordance with the rule applying
                                MORPHOLOGY                               213 to all intransitive verbs with initial w, see 3.1.3.3.1. With regard to the
  lst + 2nd pers., I have omitted to ascertain whether by the side of
 the plural kïta:toij the singular (kï:ta ? or kïta:na ? 'both of us are')
 occurs, too; it is probable that this is the case. In the 3rd pers. the
  regttlar prefix kïn- is not found, but in the plural m- occurs, and in
 the singular m- or n-. \Ve shall return to the difference between these
 two third person-forms.
    At the end of the word we find in the 2nd pers. ma:na an extra
 syllable -na, different from the normal intransitive paradigm (e.g.
 wo:mïya 'I enter', mo:mïya 'you enter'). On the other hand, the oc-
 currence of 1j in one of the two 3rd pers.-forms, maf.! 'he is', is fully in
 accordance with the mie (e.g. kïno:mïyaf.! 'he enters') ; the other 3rd
 pers., na, is irregular in this respect.
    Finally the semantic difference hetween maf.! and na has to be dis-
 cussed, a distinction which does not occur in the normal intransitive
 paradigm. Na is used when the speaker makes a statement about a
 state of affairs he finds in existence at the moment of speaking, maf.!
 is used when he makes a statement about a state of affairs which he
al ready knew about apart form the speech event.
 Examples:
 (1) ya:kono ka:pï1j te mo:se na 'but this is not my friend' (ya:kono
 'my friend', ka:pi'ij 'not', te 'but', mo:se 'this one here'; said by a girl
on discovering that the one who accompanied her at night was very
 hairy, and so was not her friend but must he a wood-spirit).
 (2) ya:kono ka:pifJ te mo:se maf.! 'but that is not my friend' (statement
to inform a third person of the speaker's friendly relations long known
to herself) .
 (1) ita:rïxpa na 'it is empty' (ita.:rïxpa 'without contents'; the speaker
opens a box and to his disappoil1tment finds nothing in it).
 (2) ita:rïxpa mafJ 'it is empty' (the speaker sees that somebody else
is about to open the box and tells him that he can save himself the
trouble).
11. The preterite-forms contain -kofJ, in the plural preceded by -to-,
fully in accordance with the mies formulated in 3.1.3.3.2.3. and
.3.1.3.3.3.1 D.
111. The lst and 2nd perSOl1S of the interrogative verbs have fj as
final consonant, the 3rd pers. has n- as initial consonant.
    1t is likely that there is also a separate interrogative form for the
lst + 2nd person, but I have not further investigated this. There is,
again in accordance with the mie, no separate interrogative fornl for
the 2nd pers. and for the 1st + 211d person.

                             3.2.   NOUNS3.2.0.   INTRODUCTION
   In the greater part of the nominal system we find either partial or
complete correspondence to certain parts of the - much more exten-
sive - verbal system.
   In the first place, agreat many nouns form syntactie categories,
although the rules that apply are for the greater part different from
those applying to verbs (see 3.1.2.).
   Secondly, complete or partial similarity to· the verbs is found with
regard to the following morphological categories:
1. Five personal categories, formed with the same prefixes as de-
scribed for the verbs in 3.1.3.2.1.,
2. The mbo-category (for the verbs, 3.1.3.2.2.),
3. The xpa-category (for the verbs, 3.1.3.2.6.),
4. The plural categories (for the verbs, 3.1.3.2.9.),
5. The no-category (for the verbs, 3.1.3.2.13.).
   There are also categories, however, which are confined to the
nominal system:
6. The generalising category with -nano,
7. Two transposition-categories the mernbers of which have the mor-
phological valence of verbs,
8. A transposition-ca.tegory whose members have the morphological
valenee of adjectives.
   In a final section it will be shown how the various nominal pro-
cesses may form further categories by combination with each other.","[232, 233, 234]"
