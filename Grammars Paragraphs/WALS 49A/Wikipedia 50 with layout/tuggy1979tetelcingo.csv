                                    INTRODUCTION      Tetelcingo Nahuatl is spoken in the town of Tetelcingo and its two colonies,
Cuauhtémoc and Lazaro Cardenas, in the municipality of Cuautla, Morelos, Mexico,
about fifty miles southeast of Mexico City. There may be as many as 3,000 speakers.
There are very few monolinguals left; many speakers are more proficient in Spanish
than Aztec.
      Tetelcingo Nahuatl differs from neighboring Aztec dialects in having converted
the old vowel length distinction into a distinction of tenseness or phonetic placement,
and in its elaborate honorific system. The speakers call their language masiewal:, which
doubtless derives from the classical word maaseewalli, which meant plebeian or vassal.
      Previous study of Tetelcingo Aztec was done by Richard S. Pittman and Forrest
and Jean Brewer, all of the Summer Institute of Linguistics. The author of this sketch
has been studying Tetelcingo Aztec (between interruptions) for five years.
       I would like to acknowledge my indebtedness to Dr. Pittman and the Brewers
for their personal help and encouragement and for the materials they provided for me
to work with. Especially helpful in preparing the present work have been the Brewers’
Vocabulario Mexicano de Tetelcingo and a concordance of texts collected by them
which was produced at the Oklahoma University Computing Center in May 1969.         lam
also indebted to many inhabitants of Tetelcingo who have taken time to teach me their
language, especially Don Martin Méndez Huaxcuatitla, Don José Catonga, and my close
friend Trinidad Ramirez, who has spent months with me trying to figure out the best
ways to express different concepts in Aztec. Also I would like to acknowledge my
indebtedness to my wife Joy, without whose love, encouragement, help, and cooking
I would not have progressed as far as I have in the study of Tetelcingo Aztec, and to
my Master, Jesus Christ, without whose motivation | would probably never have begun
it.
      All the errors, omissions, inaccuracies, overstatements, understatements,
oversights, misleading comments, over-hasty generalizations, incorrect analyses, etc.
which this sketch doubtless contains are solely my own fault.
       Ihave used the abbreviations (P-G) and (P-NH) for reference respectively to
Pittman’s Grammar and his article Nahuatl Honorifics in the few instances where I have
cited them.","[4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]"

     Even when a noun is not needed to identify the subject or object, a free pronoun
may take its place in certain situations. This mechanism is especially useful for
topicalization or emphasis, but also has other uses. Sometimes it is used to
disambiguate potentially ambiguous or nearly ambiguous verb constructions.

           HON                        toSometimes a free pronoun serves to distinguish a true reflexive sense (SUBJ-OBJ)
from a middle sense (SUBJ-IOBJ) or a passive sense.

            He HON gave himself. {not gave something for himself)
     *There are some exceptions to this:     e.g., the verb maka ‘give’ only marks the indirect object
{see second example in this section), and     ayt ‘do something’ has no object marked.

          PL      PL                    PL       A possessor pronoun is copied onto all possessed items and postpositions (with
the frequent exceptions of -pa at, -ka with, and -wa and, with, and also excepting
the cases where the P is affixed to a noun). This copying is done even when the
possessor is overtly specified in the same phrase.

          its-inside my-foot
       A subject prefix is copied onto the head or the first constituent of a predicate
noun or adjective construction. Sometimes it is copied onto both the head and its
modifiers.

                               Foreword
       This is the second of a set of three volumes dealing with Uto-Aztecan grammar.
The grammatical descriptions in these volumes grew out of a Summer Institute of
Linguistics Uto-Aztecan workshop that was held in Ixmiquilpan, Hidalgo, Mexico
from January through April 1976.    I was invited to be guest director of that workshop
and supervised the participants in the preparation of grammatical sketches of the
various Uto-Aztecan languages on which they were working. At the end of the work-
shop it was agreed that the sketches would be revised for publication, resulting in this
series. Volume I of the series consists of my own Overview of Uto-Aztecan Grammar,
which is based on the lecture material I presented during the workshop and provides
fundamental information concerning the Uto-Aztecan language family (including both
synchronic structure and diachronic evolution) and relevant grammatical concepts.
The present volume contains sketches of four modern Aztec dialects. Volume HI,
Uto-Aztecan Grammatical Sketches, is to consist of sketches of five other Uto-Aztecan
languages:   Northern Paiute by John and Joy Anderson; Papago by Dean Saxton;
Northern Tepehuan by Burton Bascom; Western Tarahumara by Don Burgess; and
Cora by Eugene Casad.
       The purpose of these sketches is to provide Uto-Aztecan scholars, linguists
generally, and other interested people with reasonably comprehensive basic information
about a variety of Uto-Aztecan languages. To facilitate understanding and comparison,
we have adopted fairly uniform transcriptions, abbreviations, and formats. Most of the
notations should be self-explanatory; see Volume I for a complete list. These three
volumes are to be considered an integral unit. The Overview constituting Volume I
provides the background necessary for appreciation of the individual sketches in
Volumes IT and III, which in turn serve to exemplify the points covered in the Overview
and to make possible ready comparison of the languages covered.","[3, 4]"

third footnote under BE for a similar proposal for verbs. Note also that most
monosyllabic nouns either have RDP in the singular (e.g., tie-te-tu RDP-stone-ABS) or
have -cin DIM (see NOUN MORPHOLOGY, N + X = N).)          Sometimes-th shows up where -tl is expected, with a slight change of meaning.

kame         and Somc. However, for most speakers « and         e tend to neutralize in this
context, and some speakers pronounce them as a definite me. So for these speakers
it is probably best to analyze these cases as examples of the ~tl ABS (whether or not
a result of epenthesis; see under Absolutive} and           -me PL, with mm      reducing to m.
Supporting this analysis is the fact that the possessed form of tlakiemt-tl clothing
is i-tlakie (his-clothing), not i-tlakiem: as one would expect if the stem were really
tlakiem:.* Note also iku dis water pot. Also, compounded forms with these nouns
do not have the ¢ in them.

      peon-PL      Some nouns have the Spanish PL in their singular form, and use the Aztec PL
to form the plural.      kaiobos               nail (from Sp.           kalobos-te          nails
      nail                  clavos nails)            nail-PI,-ke
      A very few nouns use -kc as their PL. This is probably the same ending as -k-
(ADJR-PL), which appears on almost all PL ADJ. (There is also. a -ke PL used on
PERF and FUT verbs.) This PL is pronounced -k> when it is not final.      kukowe                ox                       kukoweh-ki          oxen

where the -t was ABS,e.g., Poch. atom-t jouse, Tetel. atumt-tl fouse. This suggests that perhaps
these forms arose historically from an epenthesis.

60            DAVID H. TUGGY          The noun child behaves oddly with respect to possession.    The POSSD SG form
is suppletive:

          When PL occurs with a -crei suffix, the POSSD PL marker        -wa(n) is repeated
twice.
     mo-pél-wan-ce-ci-wa         your HON children

     Another form has PL marked twice, once with a non-POSSD and once with a

     your-servant-PL-RDP-HON-POSSD:PLSyntax          POSSR affixes attach to nouns or to postpositions. When there is an explicit N
or PRON POSSR, the POSSR affix remains on the POSSD N or P, and the explicit
POSSR follows the POSSD nominal. Sometimes the Spanish preposition de of is
also used:

   ake one, someone, however, always precedes its POSSD nominal, and normally so
do all nominal question words, including okt who?
     ake i-yulo           one’s heart
     one his-heart
     ake i-yulo (withQintonation)               whose heart?

"Subject Relatives      The relativized noun is normally represented only by the appropriate SUBJ
pronoun prefix on the relativized verb. (See examples above.)Object Relatives      The relativized noun is normally represented only by the appropriate OBJ
pronoun prefix on the verb. Non-pronominalized subjects tend very strongly to
follow the verb even in cases when ambiguity results. (Presumably this is because the
relativized noun is almost always in focus; in those cases where it is not, the focused
element will usually have been pronominalized.                Since pronouns appear in this sort of
situation only to indicate focus, they normally precede the verb.)

Sometimes oki is used with a PL animate or human referent in this type of
construction, though otherwise it is used only with SG. This strong preference for
aki is especially noticeable in constructions where a POSSR is relativized.

the relativized noun, it is often preposed to the verb.

   *The use of    okt here may be an example of the special use of okt               with a PL referent (see next
paragraph), or it may be a result of the fact that hiente is ambiguous between singular and plural
(as in the Spanish of the region). In this example it appears with the SG nie-ka instead of the PL
nie-ka-te, yet the relativized pronoun is PL.          Such confusion is common.

WH Questions).

negligible—they are practically synonymous. This RDP is probably often a result of
the tendency to make verbs and nouns have at least two syllables and preferably three;
often the RDP form is demanded for PERF (truncated) stems. (See note under BE, as
well as the last paragraph under Absolutive.)

   *Many of the examples here analyzed as an ¢ or ano tensing are probably really a matter of
ty and ow contracting to i and u in certain environments. However, it is not always clear if the
w's and y’s in these cases are really there. For instance, the many verbs.interpreted here as ending
in ow-a are listed in the Brewers’ Vocabulario as ending in oa, and they may well be right.

vowels in these situations; the VR -t:, though probably related to -te CAUS, does not.

      For a large portion of the vocabulary, the generalization holds true that verbs
ending in « are INTRNS or stative and that verbs ending in a are TRNS or active.
(Verbs ending in any other vowel are extremely rare.) There are a good many pairs
where this difference shows up clearly—in some cases -a and -t might be treated as
separate morphemes with these meanings. -ow-a is the typical TRNS VR and -cwe
or -iews is the typical INTRNS VR. Many verbs have these endings, which are no
longer clearly derived. Many verbs, especially those with CAUS or APPLIC or the
YR -ow, have a PRES TRNS marker -a which appears in PRES and IMPRF but
which drops elsewhere.

     The meaning of -on is hard to pin down. Sometimes it seems to indicate motion
away from the speaker; sometimes it indicates location away. Sometimes it implies
immediacy of action. Sometimes, when initial, it seems to just mean PAST, perhaps as
an alternative form of o- PAST (cf. English went and Ved, where went does not
particularly imply movement).                 Pittman glosses it as hence, immediately, now, and just
(P-G-42(a), D-1, 13 #1,3).

Normally only one OBJ is marked by a verb prefix; almost always the indirect OBJ is

94           DAVID H. TUGGYif it is 3P non-HON, is signalled by the APPLIC suffix.

words, they act as if they were part of the stem.

    The basic HON marker for 2P forms is mo- (REFL). Since mo- is a sort of
OM, a3P non-HON OBJ will not be marked by 4 verbal prefix, but only by the
APPLIC.         However, a 1P or 3P HON OBJ will be marked by an OBJ prefix preceding
the mo-, and an APPLIC is added anyway.

    “It seems probable that all these 3P HON forms (-9, -owa, -wa, 4o) derive from a single IMPERS
or PASS *owg, For instance, the IMPRF form is -aya instead of -ya following -lo, which
suggests that there isa final 5 or a associated with   -lo.

ways, ¢.g., with prepositional or postpositional phrases.

SBINCT verb is preceded by the EXHRT/SBINCT particle ma_ or its negative
ma-hk-amo (may-be:permanently(?)-NEG).

     A YNQ is marked by a somewhat different intonation pattern from that for the
corresponding declarative sentence.   Higher tone on the last two syllables seems to be
the main factor. Often it is difficult to tell from intonation alone whether a sentence
is declarative or a YNQ,   Some people mark YNQ with a rising final intonation.      kenekt wos                        He wants to go.
      it-want goes-FUT      keneke tyo-s                      Does he want to go?
      it-want goes-FUT      kenekt etyo-s                     Does he want to go?
      it-want goes-FUT      ——
      ki-neke fy -8                     Does he want to go?
      it-want goes-FUT      welis perhaps may be used at the beginning of a YNQ to express surprise at the
mildly expected affirmative answer.
      welis       keneke tyo-s          Does he want to go, then?
      perhaps it-want goes-FUT       YNQ are typically answered by kiema ves or amo no; by kiema or amo
followed by the whole interrogative sentence (with declarative intonation); or, more
usually, by kiema or amo followed by the main verb of the question sentence.
      TS           ,
      amo     keneke                    No, he doesn’t want to.     (appropriate response
      NEG     it-want                   to Does he want to go? above)
YNQ may also be answered by kien-amo (how-NEG) of course (cf. Spanish jcémo no?)
or by tlika amo (why-NEG) why not?.
      A YNQ with a NEG usuaily carries a mild expectation of a NEG answer.
      amo     keneke tyo-s              Doesn't he want to go, then?
      NEG     it-want goes-FUT
      ps   amo                          No, the doesn’t},   (expected response)
      well NEG
      Another common type of YNQ       involves a declarative sentence followed by the
tag mo-tiel (REFL(?)-truly) /sn’t that so?, which can carry either declarative or
question intonation. When declarative intonation is used, the question seems to be a
simple request for confirmation without any doubt of the truth-value of the statement.

        ADJ (except QNT) follow their head noun unless they are considered to be in
some sense ‘intrinsic’ or distinctive properties of the head noun, in which case they
precede the noun and may even intervene between it and its possessor prefix.

"            Above ten, Spanish numerals are more common.                            A few old people recall forms
such as wh-poa-lz (two-count-NR-ABS) forty, etc. Six is occasionally given as
mokWilt           wan-sie, seven                as mokWile    wan-ume, etc.
            The         -t on most of these NUMR is probably well treated as an ABS; it usually
disappears when -pa times or a PL is suffixed (see below). However, sometimes it
doesn’t.

     *It is probably more correct to analyze this as (-(ka)-ka, with the ¢ not being a morpheme but
 a vowel epenthesized to keep from having a one-syllable verb.     This epenthesis would precede the
 reduplication. See also tya goes, tye-s he wili be. (Cf. a similar proposal for nouns under BASIC
 INFLECTIONAL ELEMENTS, Absolutive.}
    **Normally -k is a PERF marker—only here and in the obviously related 3P HON forms of go
 (w-ilowa-(k) and wéh-w-ilowa-(k)) does it appear in the PRES, and in those cases it is retained in

vowel-final monosyllabic nouns seem to be in this class, except a few which
reduplicate (e.g., tie-te-tu RDP-stone-ABS).                  Presumably this is to avoid a one-syllable
noun (cf. BASIC INFLECTIONAL ELEMENTS, Absolutive).

     This reflex of the historical DIM -toon survives on a large class of nouns, but its
DIM force is lost in most cases and it tends to function as an ABS.

"Topicalization
       Topicalization or emphasis is usually signalled by putting the emphasized or
topicalized element first in the sentence, even if this gives an abnormal word order.

10        DAVID H. TUGGY         The presence of a pronominal SUBJ or OBJ is redundant, since these are already
marked pronominally on the verb. So their retention usually signals topicalization or
emphasis of some sort. Occasionally, however, their function seems to be
disambiguation of homophonous or nearly homophonous verb forms. (See the fol-
lowing section on Pronoun Copies.)
         Topicalization is often signalled by vocal emphasis without any change in word
order.","[15, 16]"
"Pronoun Copies
       Pronoun affixes agreeing in person and number with the subject and object of a
clause must be copied onto the verb.* Thus, any time a noun is used to identify the
subject or object, it is also represented pronominally in the verb.

118             DAVID H. TUGGYObject Complement Clauses           Object complement clauses are marked differently according to what type of
main verb they have. The following observations are far from exhaustive. Note that
the same verb used in different senses may take different types of subordinate OBJ
clauses.","[123, 124]"
"                          BASIC       SENTENCE          STRUCTUREWord   Order
       Order of major constituents is relatively fixed, in that changes in order
usually signal emphasis or topicalization. The most neutral order seems to be
as follows:
       SUBJ      (ADV)     V      (ADV)      OBJ    (ADV, P-PHR)
       Introducers, time phrases, or any ADV phrases referring to material in
previous sentence normally precede SUBJ.
       Intransitive sentences often have the order         V SUBJ.   Quotative sentences also
often have this order, probably as a stylistic variation. When the subject is a pronoun,
it is normally there only to reflect some sort of emphasis or topicalization, so pronoun
subjects do not follow the verb, except occasionally in quotative sentences.",[15]
"        Sometimes a reverse sequential time clause occurs, marked by katto first, earlier
followed by de ke.        These clauses can also follow the main verb. Often the
subordinate verb will bear an IRR marker or one of the contingency markers.

(if it-say-FUT) if it should be (that)                     is also common.        These clauses usually precede
the main clause.

tend to follow rather than precede the main clause. (See ADVERBIAL CLAUSES,

u_ is velar before velars and m. It is bilabial before p and b or f (w).

w is labial (8) before front vowels (alternating with b initially); it is voiceless

ie is a diphthong indistinguishable phonetically from ye. In general I have written
