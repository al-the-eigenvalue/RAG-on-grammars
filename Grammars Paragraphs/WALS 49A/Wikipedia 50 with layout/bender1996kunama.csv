and said“I ‘want to mount and ride the lion, (so) make a bridle and stirrups for me"".
3Fitina, not believing, asked ""How can you mount (such) a great, wise, very strong
person?"" j AThe jackel replied ""I know how; do it for me"". The blacksmith, without
further words,   made       (them) for him.   He took (them) and went.
