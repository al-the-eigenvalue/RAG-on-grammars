-nuhwakta(ni)- ""be sick,' -nuhyanik- ‘be stingy'), while still others allow (or require) transitive           AOR PRO throw PNC                           TR AOR PRO throw PNC
prefixes. In addition there are stems that take impersonal prefixes (e.g. intransitives such as               ‘he lost it’                                ‘he threw it (away from here)’
-liha- ‘boil' or -Ali- ""break') and stems that take only nonsingular prefixes (e.g. -atalo- ‘be
friends’, -a?wata?- ‘die off, -a/a?se- ""be cousins’).                                                         taho'ti-                                    tshya?tehayélha?

3.3.5.3 Verb stems can also be classified by whether they treat some of the prepronominal                     CIS   AOR      PRO   throw   PNC            CONT DU PRO do SER

requirements, but the others are, with stems requiring the dualic being most common,                          -hlek- (trans)

others have suppletive forms for when there is no incorporated noun, e.g. -ehsak-/-isak- ‘look                   ye-ks-ohale-?t-nyu-hkw-ha?
for', -us-/-es- 'be long’. There are also many verbs that offer speakers a choice between use                    PRO dish wash INST DIST INST SER
with an incorporated noun (verbal derivation) and with an unincorporated noun (syntactic                         ‘dishpan’
construction). One pattern in all this is that short verbs (single syllables or less) are very
likely to incorporate nouns.                                                                                     Akheksohalényuhse?

tendencies toward (or against) derivational suffixes and, though the boundaries may not be                       ‘I'll wash dishes for her’
tight, it may be useful to classify verbs by their affinities for derivational suffixes. The verb
root -ohale- ‘wash’, for example, quite freely incorporates nouns and derivational suffixes:              3.3.5.6 Finally it is useful to classify verbs by their aspectual requirements. Here there are

a punctual suffix is needed since the future prepronominal prefix is only compatible with a
punctual suffix. Stative verbs have several ways of creating such punctual forms. Some            3.4.3 Motion Verbs - Verbs of motion present a special case for the way they use aspectual

and then inflecting that verb with any of the four regular aspect suffixes of dynamic verbs.      typically end in /e/. There are also some derived motion verbs.
Others, especially those verb stems ending in /e/, use the -ke? suffix used by dynamic verbs
to create a habitual future meaning.    Others, especially descriptive or adjectival verbs, use   3.4.3.1 Suffix Forms - One way of deriving a motion verb is by suffixing the progressive
the -Lake? suffix. Still others use an alternative derivation suffix, most typically -at          morpheme, which ends in /e/, onto a verb with the stative suffix. Another way of deriving
                                                                                                  a motion verb is by adding the derivational suffix called the dislocative (-A-, -hn-, -As(1)-).

4.4.7. For tools a small number are built from noun roots, but most are descriptions built   expressions. All the single morpheme words not used as nouns are particles:
from the verb morphology with the instrumental suffix.                                               tho ‘there’, ‘then’; tsi? ‘as’, ‘that’; she-ki ‘still’; ostuha ‘little bit’

       yehnekataliha?takhwa?      ‘tea kettle’ (‘one heats water with it’)                   forms in these are either partially decayed or quite transparent:
       yehyatukhwa?               ‘writing tool’ (‘one writes with it’)                               niyo'lé ‘a distance’; ni-y6t ‘how it appears’; aydlhane? ‘tomorrow’; swatye'lA
       ye’nikhukhwa?              ‘needle’ (‘one sews with it’)                                       ‘sometimes’; tyétkut ‘always’

Some combinations of particles have melded and have an idiomatic meaning:                             6.2.7   Conjunctions:
      nok ‘only’ from ne ok; okhale? ‘and’ from ok ale?; okhna? ‘and then’ from ok na?                        okhale? ‘and’; ok ne?n ‘or’; nok tsi? ‘but’; ne- tsi? ‘because’; kany6                         ‘when’;   tsi?
                                                                                                              niyo'lé ‘until’; okhna? ‘and then’; tho ne on ‘then’; tsi? nahe? ‘since’
Other combinations of particles may not have melded but have developed semantic
specializations:                                                                                      6.2.8   Subordinating particles:
        onk kwi ‘now then’; kwah i-kA ‘very’; nok tsi? ‘but’; ok ne?n ‘or’; ki? wah ‘indeed’                  né""; ne?n; tsi?; tsi? ka-yA°      ‘that which’;   tsi? ndhte?      ‘whatever’;    tsi? ni-yot tsi? ‘the

Still other combinations can contain quite a few particles. These are often used to introduce
sentences or clauses:                                                                                 6.2.9   Evidential particles:
         onk ki? ale? wi ‘immediately’; kwah kas kati? wi ‘usually’; tho né ond ‘and then’                    yaka? ‘it is said’; khelé ‘it seems’;        a’ny6       ‘it seems’;   wé'ne     ‘it seems’;     tat nu?u
Several particles are exceptions to the accent placement and accent shift rules of the                        ‘maybe’; tat niwa ‘maybe’
phonology and longer combinations of particles have their own idiosyncratic accent patterns.
                                                                                                      6.2.10 Particles are used for both syntactic and discourse functions and some particles are
6.2 Functions - Functionally particles, in the widest sense, can be grouped as interrogative,         required by particular verb or noun constructions so that they are almost part of the
time, place, emphasis, negation, degree, conjunctions, subordinators, and evidentials. Some           morphology of those words:
selected examples are:                                                                                        ka? nika?slehta ‘a little car’

6.2.1   Interrogative particles:                                                                              yah tewakanthte ‘I don't know’

6.2.2   Time particles:
        ond/na ‘now’, ‘then’; oksa ‘right away’; atsinok ‘after a while’; atsyok ‘later’; ehnok       7.1 Predication - Although a single Oneida verb has within it both the predication and
        ‘a little while ago’; (n)uwa? ‘now’; the-tk ‘yesterday’; ayélhane? ‘tomorrow’; astéhtsi       (pro)nomination to stand as a complete sentence, an Oneida sentence almost always contains
        ‘morning’; kwashu'té ‘last night’; tyotukohtu ‘after’; ka? nahe? ‘in a little while’;         more words. Some simple commands constitute most of the exceptions. Particles often form
        elhiwa ‘just now’; tsi? niyo'lé ‘until’; kanyd ond ‘whenever’; oni se? ‘already’              constituents with verbs, most occurring before the verb but a few, e.g. the interrogative ka

6.2.3   Place particles:                                                                              sentences exist where nouns are used with particles (mostly ae) supplying the formal
        kA‘tho ‘here’; tho ‘there’; a?e nukwa ‘over there’; isi? nukwa ‘over there’; énike ‘up’;      predication.
        ehta‘ke ‘down’; oha‘ta ‘in front’; ohna-ka ‘behind’; akta ‘nearby’; atste ‘outside’

Glosses    are in single    quotation   marks.   Morpheme     analysis      is given by   separating   the
morphemes by hyphens and regularlizing their phonemic form. A second line of analysis
provides for each of the separated morphemes an identification with either one of the above
abbreviations or by an English gloss. Hyphens are used with the glosses to indicate where
several English words correspond to a single Oneida morpheme.

in -ukwe%- ‘person’; -/yo7t- ‘animal’; -shest ‘syrup’; and -ahtahkw- ‘shoe’. For others it is          3.3.4.1 Distributive — The possible forms are -As/u-, -Au-, -nyu-, and -w. The meaning
very much like the suffix used to nominalize verbs (-s/-, -ts/-, -As/-) as in -atokwatsl-              distributes the action of the verb in time (several times) or place (here and there) or it
‘spoon’; -nuhkwas/- ‘medicine’; -ts/%ats- ‘bird’; and -ahtahnawats/+ ‘ball’. The choices               pluralizes the patient, especially an incorporated noun. Compare the following:
among these alternates are not governed by strict rules but there are some generalizations:                     -atahahokahslu-       ‘branching roads’    -atahahoka- ‘fork in the road’
-%- tends to occur after vowels, particularly /e/; -7 tends to occur after /s/; -s/ tends to                    -atketskwanyu-        ‘get up often’       -atketskw-  “get up’
occur after /t/ and /k/; and -As/- tends to occur after /a/.                                                    -kalatunyu-           ‘tell stories’       -kalatu-    ‘tell a story’
         Nominalized verb stems can also be incorporated as nouns. Verbs are nominalized by                     -nohalenyu-           ‘wash many objects’ -nohale-     ‘wash’
the suffixation of a nominalizer morpheme which has many forms: -s/-, -as/-, -hs/-, -ahsl-,                     -ksahlunyu-           ‘set dishes out’     -ksahl-     ‘set out a dish’
-tsl-, -atsl-, -7tsl-, -a7tsl-, -ksl-, -aksl-, -a%ksl-, -?sl-, and -%-. The choice among these forms            -nuhsotu-             ‘houses standing’     -nuhsot-   ‘house standing’
is dependent on the verb being nominalized but is not strictly predictable (the best                            -ya?khu-              ‘cut up’             -ya?k-      ‘cut’
generalizations are that -As/ occurs after vowels and forms with /t/ tend to occur after glottal
stops). Some examples are:                                                                             3.3.4.2 Inchoative — The basic form is -* after vowels and -a? after consonants. It is added

         -atalo?sl-        ‘friend’ from —atalo- ‘be friends’                                                  -ata?-                ‘get in’                -at-           ‘be in’
         -yo?tahsl-        ‘job’ from —yo?te- ‘work’                                                           -yata?-               “get?                  -ya(t)-         ‘set’, ‘place’, ‘have’
         -hyatuhsl-        ‘paper’, ‘book’ from —hyatu- ‘write’                                                -ksta?-               “become old’            -ksta-         ‘be old’
There is also variation among speakers.                                                                       -nakla?-                  “become plentiful’        -nakle-          ‘be plentiful’
         The third possibility for the noun incorporation slot is an empty morpheme, usually                  -ta?-                     ‘stand up’, ‘stop’        -t-              “be standing’
a syllable or less. Some verbs require that the noun incorporation slot be filled and when a
more specific noun root or nominalized verb is not used, an empty morpheme fills the slot.             3.3.4.3 Instrumental — This derivational suffix is made up of several alternative forms and
The choice among many alternatives depends on the incorporating verb stem. Some examples               several meanings that overlap sufficiently to frustrate attempts to identify separate morphemes.
are: -?sk- in -?sko- ‘put in water’; -%sk- in -?skut ‘fry’; -7/4 in -7holok- ‘cover’; -7/- in          The basic forms of the instrumental are -At-, -7t-, -st-, -t-, and -hkw-. The choice among
-Ahenya?- ‘collapse’; -2- in -nzohale- ‘wash’; and -Any- in -Anyof- ‘set up’.                          them is dependent on the verb. For some few verbs more than one alternative is possible and
         The meaning shift that the noun incorporation adds to the verb often is to specify a          there is some variation among speakers. Granting many exceptions, there are the following
type of patient role but it is not always a predictable shift and is probably best viewed as           generalizations: -+ tends to occur after /k/; all the others occur after vowels; -st also occurs
a process of lexical derivation. The presence or absence of an incorporated noun is controlled         after /t/; after consonants all of the basic forms occur with an inserted vowel (usually /a/);
