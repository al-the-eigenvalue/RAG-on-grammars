"In each of the above cases the noun expounding the Object slot refers only to the general
category of items bearing that meaning, and not to any particular instances of the category.
Less elegantly, but more accurately, these clauses could be glossed as 'I am water-fetching'
or 'Brother is bird-shooting', where the object is semantically incorporated into the predicate.
Indeed from a functional viewpoint, such cases could be equally well classified as
intransitive. akin to the cases of noun-incorporation described in §5.5.2. That the objects
above are indeed non-referential is demonstrated by their inability to be modified by
adjectives. noun-classifiers or demonstratives:   ( 6 . 22)    MediI       perik     *6nda kaka.

"    With the exception of Chapter 2, each of the language examples presented is accompanied
by an interlinear gloss, plus a rendering into idiomatic English. Although an attempt is made
to keep them as uniform as possible, the interlinear glosses sometimes vary to suit the
demands of the discussion. In most instances they provide a morpheme-by-morpheme
account, but where larger constituents need to be identified, this is indicated using the
appropriate symbols and parentheses. Apart from the special orthographic conventions
adopted here to distinguish the different phonological values represented by the grapheme 'e'
(see §2.6.2), the format of the Karo language examples reflects the orthographic practices
employed by native speakers. Thus morpheme breaks within the word are not indicated in
the vernacular examples, but are marked by the use of a full stop in the interlinear gloss. The
full stop also serves to join together a number of words which collectively refer to a single
fonn in the vernacular, where Karo-English morpheme correspondences are not readily
expressible, for example, perlahangna 'the.not.being.the.case.of. In vernacular examples
the hyphen serves to indicate reduplicated forms (see §3.9); in those cases where such forms
have a single meaning, no corresponding morpheme break. is indicated in the interlinear
gloss.

following section.","[18, 19]"
"   Each of the clauses in examples (6. 1 ) , (6.2) and (6.3a) contains a verb relating two
nominal participants, identifiable in semantic terms as ACTOR and UNDERGOER. These
terms are used here as defined by Foley and Van Valin ( 1984:29):
      Provisionally we may characterise the actor as the argument of a predicate which
      perfonns, effects, instigates or controls the situation denoted by the predicate,
      and the undergoer as the argument which expresses the participant which does
      not perform, initiate or control any situation but rather is affected by it in some
      way.
  Actor and undergoer are generalised semantic relations, or macroroles, which admit the
possibility for further specification of say, the actor as agent, experiencer, instrument, or
                                              185
1 86source, and so on.37 However, such expansion of case-roles is not especially relevant to
Karo grammatical organisation.
   It can be seen from examples (6. 1 ) and (6.2) that in each pair of clauses, the semantic
relations hold constant; that is, propositional meaning is unchanged. In the (a) clauses, the
actor is the first-mentioned participant. It occupies the subject position, and its role as actor is
marked by the inflectional prefix NL on the verb stem (§3.4. 1 . 1 ). This correspondence of
actor with subject fits with the conunonly accepted definition of an ACTIVE clause. By
contrast, in the (b) clauses, it is the undergoer which occupies subject position, with the verb
prefix i- marking this undergoer-as-subject role, and the actor being relegated to post-verbal
position. In example (6.3b) there is no actor present in the clause at all. In so far as it serves
to undo the choice of actor for subject and replace it with undergoer instead, plus in some
cases delete all reference to an actor, this (b)-type configuration clearly corresponds to the
PASSIVE.38
    The above data provide merely an introductory glimpse of the transitive system in Karo,
which as will emerge below, exhibits a number of interesting complexities and apparent
anomalies, some of which may raise the question of whether 'active' and 'passive' are truly
applicable to the phenomena encountered in Karo transitive clauses. The position taken here
is that for the purpose of describing transitivity in Karo, it is not inappropriate to employ the
terms ' active.' and 'passive' as labels for construction types of the kind exemplified above. It
is emphasised, however, that the use of such familiar terms as labels for constructions of a
particular morphosyntactic type, should not be confused with the meanings or functions
associated with those constructions.39 As will emerge from the following account, the
function of the Karo passive is not entirely congruent with that of other languages, even
those which are closely related, such as Indonesian. Nevertheless, as long as this limitation
is borne in mind, the use of this conservative terminology is felt to be more a convenience
than a hindrance in embarking upon a discussion of the Karo transitive system.
   A detailed description of the formal aspects of active and passive clauses is now provided,
followed by an account of their relative frequencies of occurrence, their relationship to each
other, and their functions.","[195, 196]"
"4. 1 .2 NOUN HEAD
    The Head slot of the NP may be expounded by:         a personal pronoun (§4. 1 .2. 1 )         an interrogative pronoun (§4.1 .2.2)
         an indefinite pronoun phrase (§4. 1 .2.3)
         a noun, of which there are a number of subclasses, including common nouns,
         identificational nouns (§4. 1 .2.4), locative nouns (§4. 1 .2.5), and nouns derived by
         morphological processes (§3.7)         a demonstrative (§4. 1 .2.6)         numerals and certain quantifiers (Sections 4. 1 .3 )         nominalised forms, including nominalised adjectives, whole clauses (§4. 1 .2.7) and
         headless relative clauses (§8. 1 .6)4 . 1 .2. 1 PERSONAL PRONOUNS
    The personal pronoun system in Karo is formally somewhat asymmetrical, with most but
not all pronouns having both independent and dependent (clitic) forms, as illustrated in Table
4. 1 .
    The independent pronouns expound the following clause-level slots: subject, predicate of
identificational clause, and object of active clause (except for ia '3 SGIPL ' , which, in the
latter environment, has a special objective form -sa). For example:    (4.6)         Aku tubuh i Juhar.
                  I     born    at Juhar
                  I was born in Juhar.

They can also expound the Complement of all prepositional phrase types except Time,
Purpose, Dative-2, Manner and Genitive (§4.2):

An NP whose Head is expounded by a personal pronoun is restricted to possible co­
occurrence with Measure, Apposition and Detenniner slots.25

those with enclitic forms, occur with ba- in expounding the Complement of Dative-2

"4. 1 .4 POSSESSIVE SLOT
   The Possessive slot always follows the NP Head and is itself expounded by an NP.
Pronouns expounding the Possessive slot are manifested in possessive form.
                                                                                             1 35   (4. 1 92)     sora   surdam

   (4. 1 94)     i babo takal
                 at top head
                 upon the head
4. 1 .4. 1 ORDERING OF POSSESSIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE
   When these two slots co-occur in the NP, Possessive normally precedes Descriptive:
   (4. 1 95 )    rupandu mejile
                 face.your beautiful
                 your beautiful face
   (4. 1 96)    alu sorana        megang kal
                with voice. his loud     EMPH
                in his very loud voice
   (4. 1 97 )   katangku perpudi kal      man bandu
                word.my last       EMPH to    you
                my very last words to you
Limited variation to this ordering is possible, when the Descriptive slot is expounded either
by a noun (§4. 1 .5.3), or by a single intransitive verb (analysed in §4. 1 .5.5 as a subjectless
clause). In such cases the Possessive follows the Descriptive slot:
   (4. 1 98 )   siding menci mama
                trap   rat      uncle
                uncle's rat-trap
   (4 . 1 99)   amak tayangenndu
                mat thing.for.lying.on.your

   (4.20 1 )    wan berkatta
                day depart. our
                our day of departure
Instances of a possessive pronoun following a noun plus adjective, however, are not
analysed as cases of variation from the normal ordering, but rather as occurrences of
compounding ( § 3 . 1 0) , where the NP Head itself is expounded by a compound word
consisting of a noun plus adjective. The position of a possessive pronoun following such a
NP Head is therefore regular:
1 36   (4. 202)      kaka                 tuana
                 older brother/sister old.his

                 my uis kapal (a special type of woven blanket)
4. 1 .4.2 EMBEDDING OF POSSESSIVE WITHIN POSSESSIVE
   MUltiple embeddings of Possessive with Possessive are common, with up to three
Possessive slots recorded in a single NP. Such embeddings are represented below by
multiple nestings of possessive material in parentheses in the interlinear glosses of the
following examples:
   (4.204)       nakan ninindu

                 the kind thoughts and deeds of the Chief of Kuta Usang
4. 1 .4.3 SEMANTIC RELAnONS BETWEEN POSSESSIVE AND HEAD
   The term 'possessive' is used here to designate a structural relation of modification of one
NP by another. Although in the majority of cases this modification is accompanied by a
semantic role-structure of possessed-possessor, the semantic relation between the two NPs is
not limited to 'possessive' in the strict sense (see Durie 1 985b: l 09; Verhaar 1 988a:6 ff.). A
number of different semantic relations are expressed by possessive NPs, including:
(i) possession or ownership : property + owner

     By ' action' is meant both 'process/activity' as well as 'result/product' . Exponents of the
head in this category are typically verbal nouns derived by means of the affixes peN-, per-,
peN-. . . -en, per-... -en, -en, ke-... -en (§3.7 . 1 - §3.7.6).

kepuasenta                          our satisfaction4 . 1 .4.4 GENITIVE PREPOSITIONAL PHRASES
     Although possession in Karo is expressed by means of word order, the language does
possess some vestiges of a case-marking device denoting the kind of semantic relations
described above. As described in §4.2. 13, the genitive marker ni = nu = u occurs with an
NP Complement in certain archaic expressions to expound the Possessive s10t:33     (4.207)      gedang-gedang u dalin
                  long-long           of road
                  along the road (Le. for the length of the road)
32  This expression is ambiguous. It may refer to the one who is literally our father, or to a male clan mate
    whom we should address as bapa, or to the father of somebody to whom we are expressing respect and
    solidarity.
3 3 The occurrence of the nasals in the enclitic pronominals -ngku , -ndu , -nra and -na might also be
    interpreted as remnants of this genitive marker.","[144, 145, 146, 147]"
"3.3.2 FORMS
   Karo has more than sixty different morphemes which are realised as affixes. Yet the total
number of different affix fonns in the language is 2 1 . This means that a number of different
morphemes are manifested wholly or partially by the same morphs. For example, as
described in §3.2, the suffix -en represents four different morphemes. It also occurs in a
number of circumfixes: the verbalisers ke-... -en, ter-... -en, si-. . . -en, and the nominalisers
peN-... -en, per-... -en, ke-... -en, kini-. -en. In all cases the suffix alternates between I-en! and
                                         ..",[50]
"   Further afield, similar constructions are described by Siewierska ( 1 984:93 ff.) and
Keenan ( 1 985:273 ff.), drawing upon data from a wide cross-section of language families:
Indo-European (Latin, Classical Greek, Dutch, German, Irish), Finno-Ugric, Altaic,
43 Passive verbs lacking active counterparts are found sprinkled in neighbouring languages. Percival
   ( 198 1 :74) cites such ""defective stems"" in Toba Batak, whilst in Indonesian one finds the passive form
   dikarenakan 'caused by' without an active counterpart *mcngarenakan . McGinn (1 982:48) mentions
   similar instances for Rejang. A few such cases occur in English as well, for example, 'He was
   rumoured/reputed to be a spy' .
202
Dravidian, Ni ger-Congo, Nilo-Saharan, Yuman and Uto-Aztecan. These are generally
labelled 'impersonal passives', and by and large present the same dilemma as the Karo data
above: passive verbal morphology and syntax, but generally no undergoer-as-subject. The
data for Karo accord with the principal conclusions stated by Siewierska, namely: ( 1 ) that
impersonal passives cannot be defined with respect to the basic transitivity of the verb (as
seen above, some verbs in subjectless constructions are more closely related to intransitive
counterparts), and (2) the agents of impersonal passives are restricted to human actors (the
only apparent counter-example recorded in Karo involves the agent 'caterpillars' - see
example (6.78) - who were in fact humans in disguise).","[211, 212]"
"6.3. 1 .2 EXPONENTS
    The Predicate Centre is expounded by a transitive verb stem prefixed with the passive
marker i- (§3 .4. 1 .2). Although it is sometimes dropped by some speakers in informal
contexts, or in situations where other syntactic andlor pragmatic clues exist to define the
clause as passive, this i- prefix can always be attached to the verb when the Agent is in post­
verbal position, that is, when it is manifested by a noun or noun phrase, or independent or
                                                         ,
enclitic pronoun. The glossing convention '(PASS) is used below to indicate that the
passive prefix has not been realised on a particular verb, but is nevertheless recoverable.
However, when the actor is realised by a pronoun denoting first person singular (aku) or
first person plural inclusive (kira), then the Agent slot is pre-verbal , and expounded by the
proclitic forms ku- 'I' or si- 'we (inclusive) ' ; in such cases the passive prefix i- is
obligatorily absent.",[202]
"   In view of the existence of similar subj ectless passive constructions in many other
languages, there would seem to be no reason for excluding these Karo cases as non-passive
on the grounds of their apparent structural irregularity. What such constructions clearly
imply, however, is that the function of passive cannot be wholly defined in terms of the
semantic role of the passive subject, since they contain no grammatical subject at all (Kirsner
1 976:389). Put another way, since they lack a subject, such constructions serve as evidence
for the claim that demotion of the (active) subject occurs independently of the promotion of
the (active) object (Comrie 1 977:58). This accords with Shibatani's ( 1 985:837) claim that the
primary pragmatic function of passives is not promotion of the patient but rather defocusing
of the agent.",[212]
"3.3 .2. 1 N-
   In general terms this is a homorganic nasal which assimilates to the place of articulation of
the stem-initial consonant to which it is prefixed: { m-} before bilabial stops, {n-} before
dental, alveolar and palatal obstruents and fricatives, and { ng- } before velar stops. There are
five different morphemes realised by N-, which in this description are differentiated from
each other by means of a superscript number, for example, Nl-. Two of the five morphemes
realised by N- are entirely homophonous, differing only in terms of paradigmatic versus
derivational function. Grouping this pair together according to formal identity, we may still
distinguish four different prefixes which are very similar but not entirely identical in form.
They in fact differ slightly from each other in terms of: (a) their replacive effect upon the
stem-initial consonant (which is sometimes elided and sometimes not), and (b) their form
preceding a stem-initial vowel. These differences are set out in full in Table 3. 1 . As the table
shows, the array of allomorphs for each of these morphemes differs, with at least two
differences between any two arrays. Each array is comprehensively described and illustrated
in the main text below (§3.4 - §3.8) together with any exceptions to the norms reflected in
Table 3. 1 . It is also evident from the table that, morphologically, intransitive verbs are
something of a mixed bunch, exhibiting features of both transitive verbs and adjectives.

         ate                      ---->              rate

(Exception: uga ----> eruga, not *ruga)
In the speech of some older infonnants, { er-} fluctuates with {re-} in certain words.20 This
is a sporadic phenomenon:
20 Tarigan and Tarigan (1979:93) state that this is simple free variation. Informants whom I consulted
   totally rejected free variation on many items.

The prefix er- does not occur with stems beginning with Ir/.

  These prefixes are reduced to pe- and te- respectively when attached to a stem which

In a very small number of cases, the reduced form of the prefix occurs when the second
syllable of the stem begins with Ir/:
         turah                ---->             peturah
         ngerana              ---->             pengerana
         sereh                ---->             tesereh = tersereh
3.3.2.4 -sa
    This suffix manifests a number of different morphemes including the enclitic form of the
third person pronoun. Following a dental stop or nasal, -sa is usually manifested as
{ -ca } , whilst elsewhere it is { -sa} :
         muat                 ---->              muatca
         melket               ---->              melketca
         ngenehen             ---- >             ngenehenca
         man                  ---->              manca
         meteh                ---- >             metehsa
         galang               ---->              galangsa
There is some interesting variation to this pattern. Whether the { -ca} allomorph is actually
realised as described above depends upon the lexical identity of the -sa morpheme concerned.
For example, -sa is normally realised as { -sa } , irrespective of the phonological environment,
when it manifests the excessive degree marker in the adjective paradigm (§3.4.3.4).
                                                                                                433 .3.2.5 -en
   This suffix has two allomorphs:       { -en} following a stem-final consonant. and { - Vn}
following a stem-final vowel. 'V'. In the latter case the schwa of the suffix assimilates to the
preceding vowel, yielding a phonetically long vowel (§2.4. 1 . 1 0). This is not indicated
orthographically.         pedas                  ---->              pedasen

   In this description, affixes are classified according to their function. Primarily a distinction
exists between paradigmatic and derivational affixes. Paradigmatic (or inflectional) affixes do
not change the lexical identity of the stem to which they are attached. Their function is to fit
the stem for use in a syntactic frame. for example, voice marking for transitive verbs, or
predicative and degree marking for adjectives. By contrast, derivational affixes create new
words; that is, they change the lexical identity of the stem to which they are attached. This
usually involves a change in categorial status (e.g. from noun to verb, or vice versa), but in a
number of cases the resultant form belongs to the same word class as the stem from which it
is derived. For example, the circumfix per-... -en derives collective nouns from other noun
sterns : nini 'grandparent' ---> peminin 'the grandparents' (§3.7.4).","[50, 51, 52, 53]"
"   (6. 1 96) Q. Ise        si     nebaksa            si     Amin ?
                    who REL ACT.stab.PERF title Amin
                    Who stabbed Amin?
                 A. la nebaksa          banal
                    he ACT.stab.PERF self
                    He stabbed himself!
   Interestingly, the perfective suffix -sa is identical in form to the third person objective
pronoun. In light of Foley and Van Valin's observations ( 1 984:368-372) about the
correlation between highly individuated objects and what they term ""accomplishment-verb
semantics"", it seems likely that this formal identity is not coincidental. The issue will not be
pursued further here, except to note that -sa is not compatible with verbs followed by a non­
individuated or identifiable object. Compare example (6. 193) with example (6. 197):
   (6. 1 97 )       Kalak si        * nangkosa      sen      ikataken     pinangko.
                    person REL ACT.steal.sa money PASS.call thief
                    A person who steals money is called a thief.
   (6. 1 98 )       Aku ku kerangen * medilsa           b6dar.
                    I    to forest      ACT .shoot.sa wild. goat
                    I am going/went to the forest to shoot wild goats.
2206.6 SUMMARY
   In this attempt to present an accurate synchronic description of transitive clauses in Karo,
a number of important interrelated threads have been revealed, but by no means sufficiently
disentangled to provide a comprehensive account of all the factors which contribute to
conditioning the occurrence of active and passive clauses. Nevertheless it is clear from this
sketch that active and passive are functionally distinguishable from each other on more than
the grounds of mere ""stylistic difference"" (as implied for Toba Batak by Percival ( 1 981 :72».
   Aside from their usual voice-marking functions (with the passive directed more at actor­
demotion rather than undergoer-promotion - see §6.3.2.4), active and passive also correlate
very highly with imperfective and perfective aspect. at least in certain environments.
However, since aspect is signalled by other (morphological) devices when the surrounding
grammatical conditions dictate the selection of one voice over the other, it is concluded that
aspect marking is a secondary function associated with actives and passives in this language.
    As they outnumber actives by more than two to one. and as it is possible to more clearly
define the distributional patterns and meanings of actives than those of passives, it is evident
that passives play a more central role in Karo than they do in many other languages.
Furthermore. given that the passive prefix i- is often dropped (as opposed to the
indispensable active marking prefix N-), it is tempting to conclude that - contrary to the case
for English, for example - the passive is the more basic. unmarked voice, and active is the
marked voice. At this point. however. questions of cross-linguistic comparability arise.
along with the complex issue of whether the Karo passive should in fact be regarded as a true
passive at all. A number of recent studies on transitivity in other Austronesian languages
have claimed that these languages exhibit ""discourse ergativity"" (Hopper 1 983. 1 98 8 ;
Cooreman, Fox & Giv6n 1 984; Verhaar 1 988b), although a response b y Cumming and
Wouk ( 1 987) argues for caution in adopting such terminology for languages which are not
unambiguously ergative at the level of morphology. It is impossible to address such far­
reaching issues here, but in so far as the description provided above might give a better idea
of the fonus and functions associated with actor and undergoer marking in another relatively
unstudied Austronesian language. it is hoped that the Karo data might be of some small use
in assisting in the resolution of some of these problems.
                                          CHAPTER 7                                 CLAUSE-LEVEL SYNTAX   Whereas the preceding two chapters described the core features of individual clause types,
this chapter deals with clause-level phenomena which are common to all clause types.
Complementing the multitude of examples of clauses in declarative mood presented earlier, a
detailed account is now provided of interrogative (§7. 1 ) and imperative (§7.2) moods.
Peripheral constituents such as adjuncts (§7.3), operators (§7.4) and vocatives (§7.5) are
described, along with the essentially thematic processes of ordering (§7.6), left- and right­
dislocation (§7.7) and ellipsis (§7.8).","[229, 230, 231]"
"
44 This elaboration on one side of the system but not the other suggests that Karo passives are higher in
   transitivity than actives, according to the parameter of individuation propounded by Hopper and
   Thompson ( 1 980:253, 287).
45 In relating Wouk's conclusions for Toba Batak to mine for Karo, I have of necessity altered the jargon.
   Wouk explicitly rejects the terms ""active"" and ""passive"" for Toba Batak, opting instead for the term
   ""trigger system"", wherein a ""nominative noun phrase"" (relatable to what I have termed ""subject"")
   constitutes the ""trigger"" of the clause. If bearing the role of actor, this NP ""triggers"" a verbal
   morphology identified as ""+AT' (akin to the Karo active); if it is a patient (i.e. undergoer) then it
   triggers the ""-AT"" construction (akin to Karo passive). The two languages are similar enough to make
   safe and valid comparisons about these obviously identical constructions, even if it might be felt in some
   quaners that terminological violence has been perpetrated.
                                                                                             207(ii) or else the noun or NP concerned is topicalised via left-dislocation (§7.7. 1 ) and can then
be followed by a passive clause containing a coreferential resumptive pronoun agent:   ( 6 1 2 3)
      .          Kalak ah       bunuhna           bana.
                 person that (PASS).kill.he to.him
                 That fellow, he killed himself.","[216, 217]"
"These clauses are structurally identical to the passive reflexives described in §6.3.2. 1 , in that
they contain a (more or less obligatory) prepositional phrase in place of the usual nominal
undergoer. In so far as the verbs in these clauses are typically locative (either implicitly so, or
explicitly marked with the locative suffix              -i   -   see §3.5. 1), or in the case of the
communication verbs, typically associated with phrases designating the substance of the
communication or thought, then the referential content of the accompanying prepositional
phrases is - from a semantic perspective - consistently compatible with a verb-undergoer
relationship. As was the case with the passive reflexives, this 'undergoer-like' material is
encoded not as a fully-fledged, syntactically central constituent (i.e. subject) but as a
grammatically oblique or peripheral element instead. Why this should be so, when the
language demonstrably possesses the means to elevate such (semantic) undergoers to a
higher syntactic status, is not entirely clear. Part of the reason may be that their identity is
often too vague or 'unfocusable' to be relegated to the status of a true undergoer. Consider
for instance the nebulous and imprecise identity of the location referred to in clauses such as
the following:   (6.83)        Tatap            si nguda-nguda ku kawes kemuhen.
                 (PASS).look girl                  to    left       right
                 The girl looked right and left.",[209]
"3 .9. 1 0 ALLITERATIVE REDUPLICATION      Unlike some neighbouring languages (e.g. Acehnese - see Durie 1 985a:43; Indonesian ­
see Macdonald 1976:32), Karo has very few instances of the type of reduplication where two
juxtaposed stems differ only in respect of either a consonant or a vowel. Where this sort of
thing occurs in Karo it may be simply considered a case of collocation of two independent
forms of similar structure:        jemoJah-jemoJe                               swaying to and fro
        melandas-melindes                            clear and unobstructed3 . 1 0 COMPOUNDING  A compound is a word which consists of two stems and which has a meaning other than
the simple sum of the meanings of its parts. For example:                          uis              cloth(ing)         +       gara         red
        ---   >           uis gara         a special type of woven blanket, red in colourSemantically, uis gara refers to something other than just 'red cIoth(ing)' (which in Karo is
expressed as uis megara ). Structurally, it functions as a regular noun, with potential for
modification by a possessor: uis garangku 'my uis gara ' . Despite their fonnal resemblance
to phrases, compounds differ from the latter in that their combining elements are inseparable
and, except for a few instances involving negation of the second element, otherwise
incapable of individual modification.",[112]
"   (4.289)          Baba                 ku tutupen pinangko ena ndai.
                    (PASS).bring to           lockup thief             that before

identify a discourse participant which has either recently been referred to or has played a role
in the context of shared experience between speaker and addressee.
Some ambiguity concerning the function of ndai is possible. For example:   (4.290)       Enggo kabang perik e                 ndai.
                 already fly          bird     that beforeHere, ndai could be referring to the time the action occurred (,Those birds flew away a little
while ago' ) or to the birds which had been present in the discourse ( 'Those birds - the ones
we were speaking about earlier - have flown away'). The potential for movement of ndai to
another position in the clause (usually to i mmediate post-predicate position) would
disambiguate the interpretation, in this case by establishing the role of ndai as a temporal
adjunct.","[158, 159]"
"The participant fronted in these cases is usually 'old' (previously mentioned) information
(examples (7.443), (7.445)) or related to something previously mentioned (examples
(7.442), (7.444» , but may also be entirely new (example (7.446)). The fronted NP is
always post-modified by pe (§7.4.5.2. 10). NPs fronted in this way usually have a low
discourse salience; that is, they are merely incidental or peripheral to the story-line or
situation being described. Thus the reason for fronting appears not to be associated with
topicality, either new, sustained or resumed. Furthermore, investigation with informants
reveals that in the above examples, the S-P clauses concerned could be just as easily and
acceptably rendered as P-S, in which event the marking with pe would be dropped. These
facts suggest that the fronting of subject NPs in the above circumstances is optional and non­
thematic, and that the obligatory marking with pe indicates that the fronted NP is 'out of
position' . As much as anything else, the function of fronting in these cases may simply be to
provide variation for its own sake, from the usual predicate-first ordering.",[292]

2. 1 . 1 .4 IRREGULAR STRESS
   Around ten words have been found which, from a purely synchronic perspective, exhibit
irregular stress placement, nearly always on the final syllable. However, when viewed from
other perspectives, their failure to conform to the regularities of the system described above
may be seen to be systematic:
(i)      One case, /bagel [bagel 'like that, thus' is a contraction of preposition plus
         demonstrative pronoun /bagi e/ [bagi e], with the stronger phrase stress dominant over
         word stress after the process of contraction.",[22]
"   From a structural perspective, the two ter- passives are virtually identical. The agent is
always immediately post-verbal, and may be realised by a full noun phrase or by a pronoun.
First person pronoun actors occur in fuII form, second and third person usually occur as
enclitics, with the third person agentive pronoun realised as                -sa. These facts are
comprehensively iIIustrated in §3.4. 1 .3. The main point of structural difference between the
two ter- passives concerns the agent. With abilitative passives, the agent is freely omissible,
and need not even be recoverable from the context:   ( 6 .99)      Kuga kin        pe        riahna     perjuangen, anakperana ras

                 each other.",[213]
"  It remains an open question as to how many of these different Batak tongues ought to be
regarded as distinct languages, as opposed to dialects of the one language. Against the north­
south grouping adopted above is the reality that a line of mutual intelligibility may be traced
between adjacent languages in the chain from north to south. Yet the fact that each of the
groups recognises and asserts its identity on the basis of clan names and social organisation
suggests that sociocultural factors play a role equally as important as linguistic ones in
determining where dialects end and new languages begin. In many ways the issue of the
Batak linguistic divisions seems to parallel the case of the Scandinavian dialect continuum.
4    Karo is most closely related to its three neighbouring languages: Alas to the west (across
the provincial border, in Aceh Tenggara), Pakpak to the south, and Simalungun to the east.
A comparison of 207 basic vocabulary items from Karo and these adjacent languages yields
cognate percentages of 76, 81 and 80 respectively. With IndonesianlMalay, which it borders
on the north, the percentage of shared basic vocabulary is only 30%. Karo and Toba are not
mutually intelligible. Foley (1983) groups two other local speech forms, KIuet and Singkil,
together with the northern Batak dialects, but in the absence of adequate information about
these, little more can be established for the moment concerning their interrelationships.","[13, 14]"
"
6        Tarigan and Tarigan ( 1 979:84) claim that stress is phonemic as it can distinguish meaning, citing as an
         example [bayu) 'weave' versus [bayu) 'young girl'. Their failure to recognise the role of vocative stress
         here is compounded by their failure to distinguish homophones. In fact the second word bayu can occur
         with stress on its penultimate syllable when used non-vocatively, as in lorati bayu ahI [oi'ati bayu ah)
         'Ask that girl'.

"3 . 1 TERMINOLOGICAL PREUMINARIES
   The complexities inherent in establishing a universal definition of the notion of 'word' are
well-recorded in linguistic literature (Lyons 1 968: 194 ff. ; Pike & Pike 1 977: I l l ) . Even
within the one language, it is often the case that no single criterion or set of criteria can be
applied to identify and define all those structural units ,one wishes to call 'words ' .",[47]

4.2. 1 LOCATION PP
   Location PPs incorporate Position. Direction, Vicinity, Source, Proximity and Extent. All
these SUbtypes can occur as predicates of stative clauses, as locative adjuncts. and as
exponents of the descriptive slot of the NP. Position, Direction, Source and Vicinity PPs
typically exhibit a Complement filled by a locative noun (§4.1 .2.5)
4.2. 1 . 1 POSITION-l PP
  This PP contains the preposition i 'in, at, on':
   (4.308)      I ja       kam tading i Medan ?
                at where you stay      at Medan

                There's a rat inside the house.
In fast speech and in the lowlands western dialect the preposition is sometimes deleted; the
remaining locative complement is unambiguously interpreted as referring to position:

4.2. 1 .2 POSITION-2 PP   This PP is characterised by the preposition ibas or bas 'in, at, on, with ' . Unlike Position- 1
with i, which refers to a concrete or tangible location, Position-2 with ibas is used: (a) when
referring to an abstract location, such as 'in a language/family/organisation; in one' s
thoughts/mind/heart; at a point o f time' , (b) when the Complement is manifested b y a
personal pronoun or noun with human reference, in which case there is a possessive element
of meaning, (c) when the Complement is manifested by a clause:

"4.2 PREPOSITIONAL PHRASES
   Thirteen types of prepositional phrase (PP) may be identified in Karo; some of these
exhibit more than one SUbtype. As indicated by their various labels, PPs most typically
1 52expound clause-level adjunct slots. except for Genitive PPs. which expound only the
Possessive slot of the NP. Several PP types can also function as predicates of stative clauses.
namely Location. Dative. Comitative, Reference, Purpose and Similitude. Others such as
Dative-2 and Comparison PPs occur as fillers of various nuclear constituents of other
constructions (such as reflexive clauses) and as complements of certain stative and
intransitive clauses. At the phrase level. several types of PP expound the Descriptive slot of
the NP; these are identified individually in the relevant sections below.
   With the exception of the Location (Source) PP (§4.2. 1 .5 ). which is characterised by the
presence of a postposition. nan 'from' all PPs contain prepositions. Etymologically these are
                                       •a mixed bag: some are 'pure' prepositions, others serve elsewhere as nouns and adjectives,
many are derived from verbs. In some cases (Position- l and Dative-2 PPs) the preposition is
sometimes optional. Exponents of the PP Complement are equally varied: although mostly
NPs or particular subsets thereof. they may also be independent clauses (usually involving
some ellipsis of the subject under conditions of coreferentiality) or even other PPs.
   Karo PPs are now individually described in detail.","[161, 162]"
"7.7 LEFr AND RIGHT-DISLOCAnONS
          -
7.7. 1 LEFr-DISLOCATION
  This is a construction whereby an NP occurs preceding a clause, from which it is marked
off by a separate intonation peak and a potential pause (indicated orthographically by a
comma). This NP is linked to the clause by means of an anaphoric pronoun, which can bear
any of the following grammatical roles: subject (examples (7.447), (7.448)), agent «7.449),
(7 .450)), object « 7.45 1 ), (7.452)), possessor « 7.453), (7.454)), or complement of a
prepositional phrase «7.455), (7.456)). Of these, possessor is the most common. (For the
sake of clarity, the pronoun referring to the initial NP is underlined.)   (7.447)      Aku, lawes aku.
                I       go      I
                (Me), I'm going.",[292]
"   (6.9)        Aku nimai                denga       surat     i     LIP! nati.
                S :(I) P:(Acr.wait) Aux:(still) O:(letter at LIPI from)
                I am still waiting for a letter from LIPI.
   Active clauses in Karo are all monotransitive - that is, there are no cases of dual objects
(one direct, one indirect) in this language.",[197]
"   Such examples may be analysed as consisting of an NP (or, as in example (8.3 14), a
clause functionally equivalent to an NP) accompanied by a pair of intransitive clauses. These
intransitive clauses in tum each contain a predicate expounded by reh 'come' plus a subject
expounded by an adjective suffixed with -na. (Most frequently the adjective in the fIrst clause
is dekah 'long time ' . ) The precise identity of -na cannot be defInitively established. On the
one hand, it appears to be a case of a third person possessive pronoun, coreferential with the
'main' NP, which in tum is analagous to a left- or right-dislocated nominal (§7.7). Against
this conclusion, however, is the fact that fIrst and second person possessive pronouns do not
                                                                                                         343occur in place of this -na, as would be expected if the 'main' NP is non-third-person.
Alternatively, to regard -na here as a nominaliser (§3.7.8) is also unsatisfactory, in that the
relationship between the (dislocated) 'main' NP and the adjective-as-subject does have clear
possessive overtones of the sort described for dislocated nominals.","[352, 353]"
"   The appropriateness of this syntactically-motivated classification is reinforced by
regularities in morphological processes, principally affixation. For example, the suffix -en
1 8 See, for example, Percival ( 1 98 1 :52).
1 9 This statement could be amplified to include the qualification 'at least from a synchronic perspective'.
      Thus forms which are probably the result of derivation via now petrified affixes are to be considered
      simply as roots (§3.7 . 1 O).
                                                                                                 39has four different but predictable function-meaning combinations depending upon the class
of word to which it is attached:   1.    with nouns, -en generally means 'affected by...     '   2.    with transitive verbs, -en derives 'undergoer' nouns
   3.    with intransitive verbs, it signifies plurality or multiplicity
   4.    with adjectives, it marks comparative degree   Affixes are thus sensitive to the word-class membership of a given stem or root. As will
emerge from the detailed account of individual affixes below, some affixes combine in
special ways with certain subclasses, such as numerals and pronouns.","[48, 49]"
"   Since narratives typically relate a series of events which have taken place, it is not
surprising that Karo narrative discourse is literally loaded with passives, and that these are
most readily translatable into English with past tense forms. However, it is not necessarily
the case that perfective actions always refer to events which have actually transpired. Actions
which are future, potential, conditional or hypothetical are also expressed via the passive:   (6. 1 60)     Kutejin        me       engko!
                 I.swallow EMPH you
                 I'll eat you up!",[224]
"  The affixes are now described individually, in categories according to their function: first,
paradigmatic affixes, then derivational affixes deriving transitive verbs, intransitive verbs,
nouns. and finally miscellaneous items. The descriptive format for each affix focuses first on
formal aspects, then on function and meaning. These are exemplified in short lists of usually
single-word examples, but where it is necessary to clarify some special sense of what the
affix conveys, extra context in the form of a phrase or clause is provided. Morpheme breaks
are not indicated as they are felt to be evident from the individual accounts given. Finally,
homophonous affixes belonging to different functional sets are not distinguished from each
other, but where they occur within the same set, they are differentiated by superscript
numbers. An exception to this practice is the regular use of superscript numbers to identify
the five different affixes whose representation is N-.",[53]
"3 . 2 WORD CLASSES AND ROOT CLASSES
   Words may be classified according to many different criteria. As this description of Karo
is focused ultimately on the way in which words combine to form larger strings of meaning -
phrases, clauses and sentences - then the criterion of syntactic distribution is adopted as the
primary means of defining word classes or 'parts of speech' . Accordingly, the following
classes may be distinguished (their defining syntactic characteristics will be described later in
full, at the appropriate places in the overall description):     1.    Nouns
   2.      Transitive verbs
   3.      Intransitive verbs
   4.      Adjectives
   5.      Prepositions
   6.      Conjunctions
   7.      Operators
   8.      Exclamations, interjections and responses   Classes 1    -   4 are typically 'open', in the sense that there is an unlimited number of items
which belong to them. By contrast, Classes 5         -   8 have finite membership, and are considered
to be 'closed' . This statement needs to be qualified by the observation that within the major
classes there are certain subclasses which have limited membership: for example, pronouns,
demonstratives and numerals, which on syntactic grounds are most conveniently grouped
with nouns, have a limited number of members which can be exhaustively listed.",[48]
"   AFFIXES are similar to clitics, in that they are also phonologically bound forms, but
differ in that their structural domain is restricted to word formation. In the simplest cases,
affixes combine with ROOTS to form words (e.g. baba 'carry' + -en ' (nominaliser:
undergoer) ' = baban 'burden, load'). However, since this resultant construction is itself
capable of being further affixed to create a verb, as in er- '(verbaliser) , + baban 'load' =
1 7 This description is therefore at variance with the analysis by Verhaar (1984a:3,4) of analagous structures
    in Indonesian, wherein he classifies clitic pronouns as affixes.

38
erbaban 'to carry a load, to be burdened' , then i t i s also necessary to distinguish the level of
STEM, intermediate between ROOT and WORD.","[47, 48]"
"   CLITICS are a special subset of words; they are monomorphernic, unstressable forms
which never occur freely but are phonologically bound to an adjacent word. As the above
example shows, they affect the stress placement of the word to which they are attached. Karo
has only two sets of clitics:   (i)   the personal pronoun agentive and possessive forms, ku- , -ku, -ndu, -mu,
         -naJ-sa, si- and -ta17   -   agentive clitic pronouris expound clause level slots (§6.3 . 1),
         whereas possessive clitic pronouns expound the possessive slot of the noun phrase
         (§4. 1 .4) ;
   (ii) the operators nge (§7.4.S.2.9) and me (§7.4.5.3.4) which, upon loss of their vowel
         under certain environmental conditions, merge phonologically with an adjacent word.",[47]
"   Such syntactic behaviour points to the strongly nominal origins of such conjunctions, and
is in fact analagous to the situation described for NPs when a noun head is modified by a
Descriptive slot expounded by an independent clause, in which case any personal pronoun
subject of the descriptive clause is 'advanced' and attached in enclitic form to the noun head
(§4. 1 .5 .5). For example:
   (8.273)       ingan leita jumpa        --->      inganta    jumpa
                 place we        meet               place.our meet
                 the place where we meet, our meeting place   Constructions with janah, dingen, etc. could therefore be classed as a special set of
temporal noun phrases. However, from a functional perspective they do resemble nonnal
conjunctions, in that alternative, regular behaviour is attested in the following circumstances:(i) when the subject of the subordinate clause is coreferential with the subject of the main
clause, and thus omitted:   (8.274)       Dingen ngoge            aku man          gaJuh.
                 while     ACT.read I            ACT. eat banana
                 While reading I ate a banana.(ii) when the subject of the subordinate clause is not pronominal, but simply a regular NP:   (8.275)       Taren pernanden erdahin j juma perbapan erjudi i kede.
                 while mothers          work      in field fathers       gamble in shop
                 Whilst the women are at work in the fields, the menfolk gamble in the coffee
                 shop.",[346]
"   In this chapter the term WORD will be used in the sense o f 'grammatical word' (Pike &
Pike 1977: 1 13; Matthews 1 974:32), as distinct from the notion of 'phonological word'. For
instance, the utterance lrumahtal is a single phonological word, with characteristic stress on
the penultimate syllable (§2. 1 . I . 1 ), but is grammatically a sequence of two elements, rumah
' house' and -ta 'our' , the latter morpheme being a clitic form of the first person plural
(inclusive) pronoun kita. Since the construction rumahta 'our house' (including the
addressee), expounds a noun phrase (§4 . 1 ) analagous to rumah karni 'our house' (excluding
the addressee), it is analysed as consisting of two grammatical words, not one.",[47]

(d) Apart from its capacity for non-person reference in agentive and possessive forms, the
third person pronoun differs markedly from the other personal pronouns in having a separate

   (4.226)       si   mbelang pinggel
                 title wide           ear
                 Big Ears
   (4.227)       si   gedang buk
                 title long hair
                 women in general
   (4.228)       bengkala               biring gurung
                monkey. species black back
                a particular species of monkey used for picking coconuts, which, if it has a
                black back, is reputedly impossible to train (used to refer to somebody who
                is difficult to teach)
(ii) the nouns ate 'heart' (lit. 'liver' - the seat of one's emotions) and ukur 'mind' are often
pre-modified by an emotive adjective to form a phrase which may function as subject
(example (4.229)) or as a base which may be prefixed with er- (§3.6. 1 ) to form an
intransitive verb (example (4.230))
   (4.229)       Ceda     ate      naring           nglanl         pusuhku.
                broken heart only.EMPH ACf.reside in heart.my
                Only disappointment filled my heart.
   (4.230)       La lit gunana emembeh ate,                  la   lit gunana ercian   ate.
                 not BE use.the have.angry heart not BE use. the have.critical heart
                 There was no use in being angry, no point in being critical.
                                                                                           141
4. 1 .5.3 NOUNS
   The Descriptive slot may be expounded by a noun, which describes or specifies 'what
kind of (noun)' the NP Head is:
   (4.23 1 )        kite     buluh
                    bridge bamboo
                    bamboo bridge
   (4.232)          rumah adat
                    house tradition
                    traditional house
   (4.233)          siding menci
                    trap     rat
                    rat trap
   (4.234)          kerja tahun
                    feast year
                    annual feast (to celebrate the village harvest)
NPs with a noun expounding the Descriptive slot are superficially identical in structure to
NPs with a noun expounding the Possessive slot. The two constructions are distinguishable
on syntactic grounds, however, with the exponent of the Possessive slot having the potential
for left-dislocation (§7.7 . 1 ), as exemplified in (4.235). By contrast, a noun functioning as
exponent of the Descriptive slot cannot be thus extracted, as illustrated in (4.236):
   (4.235) a. Sora          surdam e        mejile.
                    sound flute    that beautiful
                    The sound of that flute is beautiful.
               b . Surdam e         sorana mejile.
                   flute    that sound.its beautiful
                   That flute, its sound is beautiful.
   (4.236) a. Siding menci enda kitik.
                    trap     rat     this small
                    This rat trap is small.
               b.   *Menci enda      sidingna kitik.
                    rat       this   trap.its   small
Included with the descriptive NPs are two other types of particular note:
(i) where the Head noun and the descriptive noun are coreferential, the descriptive noun
being derived from a verb, and morphologically marked as either Actor (examples (4.237) -
(4.239)) or Undergoer (examples (4.240) - (4.242)):
   (4.2 37)         kalak perjudi
                    person gambler
                    gambling man, gambler
  (4.238)           biang perburu
                    dog    hunter
                    hunting dog
1 42   (4.239)      cuan pencamet
                hoe weeder
                weeding hoe
   (4.240)      kalak bayangen
                person imprisoned.in.stocks
                prisoner in the stocks
   (4.24 1 )    barang tangkon           =   barang tinangko
                goods thing. stolen          goods thing. stolen
                stolen goods
   (4.242)      benang tinenges
                thread thing. sent
                thread sent
In his treatment of analagous structures in Indonesian, Verhaar ( 1988a:20-2 1 ) regards such
constructions as ""restrictive appositions"". However, in view of the potential of these Karo
constructions to be further modified by a possessive (which is not a characteristic of
apposition phrases - see §4. 1 .7), they are categorised here simply as a sUbtype of descriptive
NP:   (4.243)      biang perburuna
                dog hunter.his
                his hunting dog
   (4.244)      benang tinengesku
                thread thing.sent.my
                the thread I sent
(ii) where the Head noun and the modifier exhibit an actor-undergoer relation:
   (4.245)      pennakan kerbo
                shepherd water.buffalo
                water-buffalo herder
   (4.246)      perlanja sira
                porter salt
                salt-carrier
  (4.247)       penukur isap
                buyer     cigarette
                cigarette money; a tip
   (4.248)      penagan api
                lighter   fire
                flintThe head nouns in such cases are derived from verbs via prefixes peN- (§3.7. 1 ) and per­
(§3.7.2).
                                                                                            1 434 . 1 .5.4 PREPOSITIONAL PHRASES
   The Descriptive slot may be expounded by PPs expressing location (§4.2. 1 ), dative
( §4.2.4), reference (§4.2.7), purpose (§4.2.8) and similitude (§4.2. 1 O):
   (4.249)       daJan i Lau Baleng nan ku Tarotung
                 road at Lau Baleng from to Tarntung
                 the road from Lau B aleng to Tarntung
   (4.250)       surat ibas cakap      Karo
                 letter in    language Karo
                 a letter in Karonese
   (4.25 1 )     lau    man inemen
                 water for to.be.drunk
                 water for drinking
Possessives take precedence over descriptives manifested by PPs:
   (4.252)      perlawesku ku MMan
                going.my to Medan
                my going to Medan
   (4.253)      utang kami man raja
                debt we       to    chief
                our debt to the chief
   (4.254)      belinna   ukur pengulu Ajinembah man Appung Baros
                big.NMS mind headman Ajinembah to         Appung Barns
                the headman of Ajinembah's kindness towards Appung Barns
4. 1 .5.5 CLAUSES
  The Descriptive slot may be fllled by an intransitive or transitive clause, with or without an
explicit subject. The latter case occurs when the subject of the verb is understood to refer to
people in general. Examples without subjects are:
   (4.25 5)     kerja mengket rumah
                feast ACT.enter house
                house-warming feast
   (4.256)      a5am erjudi
                capital gamble
                gambling stakes
   (4.257)      daJan ndarat i rumah nan
                way go.out at house from
                the way out of the house
   (4.258)      wan mulai nabah          kayu
                day begin ACT.cut tree
                the day to begin felling the trees
144Examples with subjects are:
   (4.259)      ingan pusung       ndabuh
                place umbilicus fall
                birthplace
   (4.260)      paksa kami jumpa
                time we meet
                the time we met
   (4.26 1 )    sora kalak      erkusik-kusik
                voice person whisper
                the sound of people whispering
   (4.262)      dalan kita sitandan             enda
                way we know.each.other this
                the way we became acquainted
When the subject of the modifying clause is a personal pronoun, it is normally (as opposed to
example (4.262» manifested in possessive form, attached to the Head noun:
   (4.263)      dalanta pulung
                way.our gather
                the way we assembled
   (4. 264)    inganta    jumpa
               place.our meet
               our meeting place
   (4.265)      babanku       nggeluh
               burden.my live
               my burden of living
   (4.266)     inganna cebuni e
               place.his hide      that
               his hiding place
   (4.267)     Mbera-mbera la lit alangenndu           muatsa        denggo.
               hopefully     not BE obstacle.your ACT.fetch.it later
               Hopefully there will be no obstacles for you to take it later.
The Descriptive slot may also be expounded by an interrogative clause expressing location or
manner:
   (4.268)     ingan i ja         nan     reh   sora   e
               place at where from come voice that
               the place where the voices were coming from
   (4.269)     dalan kuga ia bengket ku bas        rumah
               way how he enter          to inside house
               the way he got into the house
                                                                                              1454. 1 .6 DETERMINER SLOT
   To account for maximally expanded NPs in Karo, two Determiner slots are posited: DET
1 and DET 2.4 . l . 6. 1 DETERMINER 1
   DET I is expounded by either a demonstrative pronoun, a temporal adverb (ndai or
ndube), or the specifier -na. These are now described in tum.","[150, 151, 152, 153, 154, 155]"
"
60    Ellipsis does not cover cases of systematic omission of elements such as the second person addressee in
      imperatives (§7.2. 1 ), or the absence of agents in passive clauses where the identity of the actor is
      unknown or irrelevant (§6.3 . 1 .3). There are several other cases of omission of elements, however, where
      it is debatable as to whether ellipsis is involved'or not:
      (i) the omission of the locative preposition i 'in, at, on' in speech (a feature especially of the lowlands
      western dialect) and the preposition man 'to, for' in Dative-2 PPs (§4.2.4.2). For example:
           (I)   Kempungku      si     ntua      ndai   Mt5dan ia    sekolah.
                 grandchild.my REL oldest before Medan he attend. school
                 My oldest grandchild is attending school [in] Medan.
           (2)   . .gelah ula
                 .               reh    banta kejadin si        la   mehuli.
                 PURP don't        come to.us event      REL not good
                  ... so that something bad does not happen to us.
      (ii) the omission of a Dative-2 PP in the presence of a verb expressing transfer, or in the case of pseudo­
      reflexive clauses (§6.4.3). For example:
           (3)   Adi ka/imbubu,         arus     sibert5ken manuk    (man bana).
                  if    mother' s.lineage must we.give      chicken (to     them)
                  As for the kalimbubu, we must present a chicken (to them).
      (iii) the omission of conjunctions expressing time, condition, reason and antithesis when two clauses are
      linked paratactically (§8.5).
      In each of the above cases, the frequency of omission of the elements is such as to make their absence
      virtually systemic, yet their reinstatement to the clauses is universally recognised by native speakers as
      effecting grammatical completeness.
2887.8 . 1 FULL NPs
    Topical NPs which expound subjects may be ellipsed if their identity has been established
in the immediately preceding context.6! Such ellipsed topics are normally rendered in English
with a pronoun. (In the following examples, ellipsed material is indicated between square
brackets in the glosses.)
     (7.479)       Ndai reh bapa, gundari enggo lawes.
                   before come father now        already go
                   Father came earlier, now [he] is gone.
     (7.480)       . . . sebap kite   kitik nge,         tentu    1a laban.
                   because bridge small EMPH certain not endure
                   ... because a bamboo bridge is small, [it] certainly wouldn't be able to
                   withstand the weight upon it.
     (7.48 1 )     Adi bapa    ras nande, ndahi        mama ku Kuta Kepar.
                   if   father and mother ACT. visit uncle to Kuta Kepar
                   As for Father and Mother, [they] have gone to visit Uncle in Kuta Kepar.
     (7.482)      Ibuat          Pa Rontang sada ranting. Icelurkenna                      ku api.
                  PASS.take Pa Rontang one branch PASS.immerse.he to fire
                  Pa Rontang took a branch. He thrust [it] into the flre.
     (7.483) Q: Lit senndu ?                               A:.   La lit.
                  BE money. your                                 not BE
                  Have you any money?                            [1] haven't [any].","[297, 298]"
"   Despite superficial appearances, however, the above clauses are all unequivocally
intransitive, on the grounds that they cannot be passivised as regular transitive clauses can be
passivised. In the above cases, the post-verbal NP is non-referential: no particular bicycles,
salt or spinning tops are being referred to. The NP can be considered to semantically coalesce
with the preceding verb to form a phrase translatable as, say, 'bicycle-selling', 'salt-trading',
                                                                                              1 79or 'top-gambling' . As these clauses are systemically non-passivisable, the post-verbal NPs
cannot be properly considered as objects in the grammatical sense. Nor are they complements
in the sense described above (§5.4.2), where a complement is a constituent which normally
follows the predicate, but which can be separated from it whenever the latter is fronted across
the subject. The post-verbal nouns in examples (5.76) - (5.78) above cannot be separated
from their verbs by any intervening material, a grammatical fact which is reinforced by the
phonological impossibility of an intervening pause between the two elements. Nor can they
be further modified by possessives, descriptives or determiners in the usual manner that NPs
can be modified. In view of these characteristics, such instances are analysed as derived
intransitive phrasal verbs, which have in effect been created by incorporating an undergoer
NP into the intransitive verb phrase.","[188, 189]"

August 1991. During the years that it has taken to bring this research to fruition, I have
received support and help from a number of institutions and individuals.","[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]"
"5 . 6. 1 .3 STATIVE EXISTENTIAL CLAUSES USED TEMPORALLY
   A minor use is made of existential clauses in temporal expressions. In such cases, lit is
followed by a subject expounded by a temporal noun phrase (§4. 1 .3 .2.2 (vii)), accompanied
by an optional Locative PP. No permutations are possible. The resultant clause denotes the
length of time elapsed. Distributionally it is restricted to expounding a Time adjunct.
                                                                                                        l S3   (5 . 1 1 1 )       Lit dua tahun i            Bangko, tubuh anakna.

                      After two years in Bangko, they had a child.","[192, 193]"
"(2)       Since it occurs in significantly fewer words than the other vowels, it naturally has a
          more limited distribution. It does not occur word initially, for example, and with three
          exceptions, in citation form is always found in a stressed closed syllable. In 1 2 out of
          25 instances it occurs in independent morphemes of eve structure, in another four
          cases in monosyllabic roots prefixed with me-, and in five of the remaining cases it is
          followed by /hi. As all of the lexemes in which Iwi occurs are contentives rather than
          functors, it has a very high potential for occurrence in words which bear phrase
          stress. For example:             (i)     Enggo kam reh ?                              Have you come?
                      [�I)g6   kam i'W:h]                         (used in greetings)             (ii)    La terteki       aku kam.                    I can't believe you.
                     [la t�ftul:ki aku ka:m]             (iii)   Raga enda enggo demo                         This basket is full.

1 0 Of the minimal pair Ip;;) SQII 'to push on the belly of a woman in labour, to accelerate the birth' versus
      IIJ;;) SUIl/ 'kind of leaf , only the second was known to my informants, 1'rJ sUIII being a leaf possessing
      various medicinal qualities.
      The other citation, Ig;;)rjI 'to have lost and start again, in a boys' game called panta ' versus IgUIrJI 'kind of
      deer trap' , is questionable in two respects. First, the format of the entry of this root word on page 1 14 of
      the dictionary - GENG (gong) - is not suggestive of a pronunciation difference between the two (in fact
      three) lexemes listed therein. It is not at all clear why Adelaar deduced that the first was pronounced
      differently from the second, as the pronunciation guide ('gong') precedes both. Secondly, while there is a
      word 19UIrJl meaning 'to set or reset elements in a game, or equipment (such as a trap)"" the meaning cited
      in Neumann regarding 'a kind of deer trap' was unknown to my informants. I suspect there is in fact only
      one word /gtJIIJ / which, as explained in this description, is articulated as Ig;;)rY when unstressed.
11    With the various affixational possibilities afforded by a productive derivational morphology, the actual
       number of different words in which it occurs would be between double and treble that number. It may
      also be noted that Neumann does not indicate a number of unconteritious cases of [UI], for example
      /b;;) ntUIhal, which he records as [b;;)n(;;) ha].
22
              In unstressed syllables, however, it is usually replaced by I�/:
              (iv)    Bapa si reh ndai.                       It was Father who came.
                      [bapa si r�h nd3i]
              (v)    UJa tekindu kai gia nina.                Don't believe a word he says.
                     [ula !�klndu k3i gia nina]              (vi)    Terdemindu kang kam?                    Can you fill it?
                      [!�fd�rrUndu kaI:J     ka:m]
Although such data seem suggestive of a possible complementary relationship between [w]
and [�], none of the hypotheses which postulate [w] as a stressed or lengthened variant of I�I
holds up under close examination.12 The account of length in §2. 1 .2 shows that this is a
predictable and therefore not phonemic feature of the language.
   Most crucially, instances of contrast in identical and analagous environments are of
sufficient number to establish a phonemic difference between Iw/ and I�/.","[31, 32]"
"Me also occurs after subject NPs. These are always definite, and usually have already been
mentioned in the immediately preceding context (or are readily recoverable from the
surrounding context of discourse, as in the case of second person pronouns). In such cases
me singles out a participant from the context and highlights it for further comment:

7.4.5 PARTICLES
   These are mostly monosyllabic forms which almost always post-modify other
constituents, including other operators (and sometimes even other particles). They can never
occur as free forms in isolation, and are subject to strict distributional limitations. These latter
properties distinguish them from other relatively mobile and independent forms such as
emphatic adverbs (e.g. tuhu-tuhu 'really'). Syntactically and phonologically, particles enter
into phrase-level constructions with the constituents they follow, but from a semantic
perspective they tend to modify the whole clause in which they occur. With few exceptions
they are restricted to occurrence in main rather than subordinate clauses.
                                                                                                  257   In terms of function, particles can be subclassified into three types: softening particles,
emphatic particles and discourse particles. It is not uncommon for a single particle to have
more than one meaning or function, depending upon the environment in which it occurs. For
instance, kin and nge vary in meaning according to whether they occur in yes/no questions,
in content questions or in declaratives. In some cases it has been more convenient to describe
particles according to the clause type in which they occur (e.g. in imperatives or
interrogatives). When this has been done, it is indicated below, together with the appropriate
cross-references.","[266, 267]"

3 . 8 DERIVING MISCELLANEOUS FORMS
3 . 8 . 1 N4 _
   This homorganic nasal prefix is attached to certain measure nouns (§4. 1 .3.2.2) which, as
it happens, all begin with an obstruent. The initial consonant of the noun stem is retained.
The function of this prefix is to fonn measure nouns from various other stems. In some
cases the semantic connection between root and derivative is quite transparent, in others more
circuitous. Sometimes the connection is simply unknown.

and (c) other noun stems, to form respectively: (a) temporal adjuncts, (b) quantifiers, and (c)
various stative predicate exponents and noun modifiers. With many derivatives in categories
(b) and (c) the prefix has two allomorphs in free variation, { se-} and { si- } .

"8.2.9 NOUNS WHICH TAKE COMPLEMENTS
   As described above, the majority of cases of complementation involve a complement
clause bearing some relation to a particular adjectival or verbal predicator. It is also possible
for complement clauses to occur with certain nouns, which may be roots themselves, or
derived from adjectives and verbs (principally from the sets described in §8.2.2 and §8.2.3).
Structurally, a complement clause associated with a particular noun is usually encoded as an
exponent of the Descriptive slot in the NP (§4. l .S.5):   (8. 1 83)          Bagendam carn majekken rumah adat.
                      like.this       way ACT.erect             house     tradition
                      This is the way to build a traditional house.",[331]
"   One other possibility exists for the shared constituent: it may be a possessive NP whose
head is expounded by a noun referring to some inalienable body part or action possessed or
performed by an animate entity which is both the referent of the Possessive slot of the NP
and the putative subject of the second clause. Such cases occur only in accordance with the
second ordering possibility described above (i.e. between the two clauses).",[336]

   Based upon precategorial as well as a few intransitive verb stems (roots and er­
derivatives), -um- is infixed into the first syllable of the root to produce an intransitive verb
which means to do an action erratically or unsteadily. It is not very productive. The prefix has
two allomorphs, { -um- } and { -em-} , in free variation:

   This prefix forms nouns from (mainly transitive) verbs with prefix NI -; its allomorphs
parallel the verb variants:make          to wear                       pemake            way of wearing

pinangko                thief
pilako                  habit, behaviourWhen based on a verb with suffix -i or -ken, the noun with peN- sometimes retains the
suffix. Retention or loss of the suffix is neit predictable:ngerakuti          to bind                  pengerakuti       thing used for binding

nadingken        to leave                   penading             depositThe precise meaning of a peN- noun cannot always be detennined out of context. For
instance, penumt (from nurat 'to write') can mean 'a writer (person); a writing implement;
the way someone writes' ; only its use in a particular sentence can disambiguate these
potential meanings. Furthermore, the final three categories of meaning listed above ( 'way' ,
'process' and 'product' of the action) tend to shade into each other, such that assigning a
given form (e.g. penampat assistance - product? or process?) to one category or another
depends upon careful consideration of its meaning in a large number of occurrences in texts.3.7.2 per-
