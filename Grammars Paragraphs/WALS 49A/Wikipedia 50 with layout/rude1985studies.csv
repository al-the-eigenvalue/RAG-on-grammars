      ‘Afua    made     cornbread     for    Kofi'The verb 'give' may even be the origin of the English preposition to, as
Robert Hetzron (personal communication) has noted.     The Indo-European
verb for 'give' is everywhere derived from *dd-, but not in Germanic.
If, however, this morpheme had come down to us in English, it would have
the form to [tu].   Could it be that this preposition entered Germanic as
a serialized verb marking the dative?    Give in Germanic is cognate with
words meaning ‘grasp’ or 'hold' in other Indo-European languages,     and
thus a construction like John gave the book to Mary could derive from a
serialization        like    John   took    the     took   gave   Mary.",[175]

"      7Relational Grammar recognizes an abstract level of structure of
complete syntactic autonomy (see Perlmutter [1953-84])}.    In this
abstract level of structure there are syntactic relations that represent
neither semantic role nor discourse function, although, the 1, 2, and 3
relations look suspiciously like agent, patient,  and dative goal.      And,
it is worth noting here,  the universality of the abstract,    syntactic ""3""
is not supported by the Nez Perce evidence.   A dative case is totally
lacking in Nez Perce.  Patient and dative direct objects have exactly
the same syntactic description:   their substantives  are marked by -ne,
and    both        express            verbal        agreement           via        'e-,    pée-,            and   nées-.                  Further,         it
is    only     the        dative           goal     of   a    bitransitive                verb,         just      as        it       is     the
patient        of        a unitransitive                 verb,         that        conditions               the   reflexive,                  the
reciprocal, the passive, detransitivization                                                 via @- and hi- when it                                   is
lst or 2nd person, and the antipassive when                                                 it is possessed  by the
subject (see Chapters VI and VIII).   Since there is no seperate
morphological or behavioral ""3"" relation in Nez Perce, why should there
be a purely abstract non-semantic, syntactic ""3""?   In attempting to
limit abstractness in phonology, Kiparsky (1968) would disallow
structures               that undergo              absolute neutralization.                                  Is   this           not        also    a
reasonable               restraint  on             abstractness in syntax?        8 when           the     verbal           complement           functions            as        the    direct           object          of    a
transitive               verb,       the     genitival            argument           of    the        nominalized                    verb     may
