3.1.11. Non-constituent word-formsSince certain determiners and all case-markers are suffixes, attached to the
end of a complete noun phrase and phonologically bound to what is other-
wise the final element, it often happens that a noun phrase ends in some-
thing which is a single phonological word and apparently a single gram-
matical word-form but which is not a syntactic constituent. For example, the
sequence ume txiki 'little child' can take the plural definite article to produce
ume txikiak '(the) little children', in which the single form txikiak is not a
constituent: the syntactic structure is [ume txiki\ak. The same thing can hap-
pen when a case-suffix is added: the noun phrase zenbait gizon 'several
men' can take the ergative case-suffix to produce zenbait gizonek, but again
gizonek is not a constituent here: the syntactic structure is [zenbait gizon]ek.
The Basque grammarians of the past, trained only in the Latinate word-and-
paradigm model of description, frequently misunderstood this point badly,
and their grammars often present full paradigms for what are erroneously
called ""undefined"" or ""indefinite"" (mugagabe) forms: gizon 'man' (""abso-
lutive indefinite""), gizonek (""ergative indefinite""), and so on. These forms
do not really exist: a case-suffix cannot, in general, be added to a bare noun,
but only to a full NP with a determiner.
                                                              Postpositions   1713.2. Case and number inflection of noun phrases
     J.I. Hualde3.2.1. The nature of nominal inflectionIn noun phrases containing a single noun only the last word of the phrase
carries case and number inflection, which is marked by suffixes. The word
in the noun phrase inflected for case/number is not necessarily the head
noun. If an adjective or another modifier follows the noun the inflectional
suffixes will appear on this word. That is, in Basque number and case inflec-
tion is a property of noun phrases. In the following examples, we separate
the inflectional suffix from the stem with a hyphen for clarity:Table 58. Nominal inflection
 (a)   gizon-ari               'to the man'
       man.DET.DAT
 (b)   gizon gazte-ari         'to the young man'
 (c)   gizon gazte hon-i       'to this young man'
More details on the structure of noun phrases are given in section 3.1. In this
section, we adopt a form-based approach to the study of the morphology of
nominal inflection, without meaning to imply that all the forms listed corre-
spond to grammatical cases or are otherwise syntactically comparable.","[200, 201]"
"
4.8.2. Causee marking in morphological causativesThis section is devoted to causee marking in morphological causatives,
where the logical subject caused to act may not occur as a subject. This
grammatical function is taken over by the causer, which, if expressed, will
appear in the ergative case. The causee, on the other hand, will take on ab-
solutive or dative marking. The dialectal and argumental factors which rule
the usage of one case marking versus the other are discussed in the follow-
ing sections. We will examine the case marking of the causee ('logical sub-
ject') of intransitive, monotransitive and ditransitive predicates. In order to
make case marking patterns in the examples more illustrative, pronouns are
provided in cases where the nominal would have been dropped in actual
use. These pronouns are inserted in square brackets in corpus examples and
in parentheses in constructed examples.",[626]
"Neuk alone would also be possible here. Note the double case marking, in
this instance ergative.
                                                             The noun phrase   153
    There is variation in the inflection of the intensives. The forms like neu
and nihaur most often retain the same stems with all case-suffixes, as in er-
gative neuk and nihaurek, while the forms like nerau usually exhibit the
suppletive stems of the demonstratives, and hence nerau has ergative ne-
ronek. But other forms are found.
    There are also intensive pronouns for the third person. Most commonly,
we find singular bera 'he himself, she herself, while the plural is variously
bera or berak 'they themselves'. Some northern varieties make a distinction
here, using singular beraur and plural berauk in isolation, but bera to ac-
company another item, usually a demonstrative: hence beraur but hura
bera, both 'he himself, she herself. Western varieties use only bera in both
functions.
    In some eastern varieties, the intensives have an additional use, to ex-
press 'by oneself, 'alone'. Examples: Nihaur naiz hemen Ί am alone here';
Pello bera bizi da 'Pete lives alone'.
    In all varieties, postposed ber- plus the article makes the ordinary third-
person intensifier: Igone bera 'Igone herself, liburua bera 'the book itself,
gizonak berak 'the men themselves'. Any case-suffix is added to both ele-
ments: Igonek berak egin zuen 'Igone herself did it'. Some northern varie-
ties allow ber to be preposed, with no second article, and hence allow ber
liburua as well as liburua bera for 'the book itself.
    In the classical Lapurdian language of the 17th century, a genitive was
obliged to appear in its intensive form if and only if it was coreferential with
another noun phrase (not necessarily the subject) in the same simplex
clause, whether or not that other noun phrase was overtly present. Hence the
classical language made a sharp distinction between (a), with an intensive
genitive and (b), with an ordinary genitive of a demonstrative:(118) a. Hartu du bere        liburua.
         take AUX his.lNTS book
         'He took his (own) book.'
      b. Hartu du haren liburua.
                      his
         'He took his (someone else's) book.'","[182, 183]"
"   The interrogatives do not, in general, distinguish number. However, in
Bizkaian alone, there exist explicitly plural forms constructed by suffixing
-tzu(k): nortzu(k) 'who?' (plural), zertzu(k) 'what?' (plural), and zeintzu(k)
'which?' (plural) (cf. Sp quienes, cuäles).
   For the use of interrogatives as indefinites, see section 3.1.6.1.4.
                                                             The noun phrase   155
3.1.6.1.4. Indefinite pronouns There are three major classes of indefinite pronouns (and related items), and
 these are not equivalent. Almost all are formed from the corresponding in-
 terrogatives, by affixation or reduplication.
    The first group we may call the 'existential' indefinites; these correspond
 to the English indefinites in 'some-', and are formed by suffixing -bait to
 the interrogative: norbait 'somebody', zerbait 'something', nonbait 'some-
 where', noizbait 'sometime', nolabait 'somehow'. There is no form related
 to zein 'which?'
    This -bait is historically derived from reanalysis of the verbal prefix bait-
 (see sections 4.10.1.1.6 and 4.10.2.1.3). In the earlier language, therefore,
 -bait followed a case-suffix, as in norkbait (ergative) and noribmt (dative).
Today only the restructured forms like norbaitek and norbaiti are in use.
However, internal inflection is still found in norabait '(to) somewhere'
(more common than nonbaitera)
    The pronouns norbait and zerbait may be modified, as in zerbait ona
 'something good' and ona den zerbait 'something which is good'; note the
presence of the article -a in both constructions. The first construction is only
possible when the pronoun stands in the absolutive case.
    The pronoun zerbait may take a diminutive suffix to express 'a little
something'. Eastern varieties use forms like zerbaitto, but western varieties
have a different ordering, with zertxobait.
    In eastern varieties (only), zerbait may be used as an indefinite deter-
miner, as in zerbait obra 'some piece of work'.
    Equivalent in function, but much less frequent, are nor edo nor 'some-
body' and zer edo zer (B zeozer) 'something'; these consist of nor 'who?'
and zer 'what?' reduplicated about edo 'or'.
    Semantically similar to norbait, but perhaps emphasizing the sense of
'somebody or other', 'one or another', is a construction involving two in-
stances of bat 'one' connected by edo 'or', by the genitive -en, or by both:
hence, bat edo bat, baten bat, or bat edoren bat.
    The second group are the 'free-choice' indefinites; these correspond to
the English indefinites in 'any-' when these are not polarity items. There are
two different sets of these, the first found more or less throughout the coun-
try, the second largely confined to the west. The first set is formed by suf-
fixing nahi 'want' to an interrogative: nornahi 'anybody (at all), anyone
(you like)', zernahi 'anything (you like)', nonnahi 'anywhere (you like)',
noiznahi 'any time (you like)', nolanahi 'any way (you like)', zeinnahi 'any,
whichever you like'. These are similar in form to the Castilian items like
156 Morphology
quienquiera 'anybody at all', and may have originated as caiques. The sec-
ond set is formed by prefixing edo 'or' to the corresponding interrogative:
edonor 'anybody at all', edozer 'anything at all', edonon 'anywhere at all',
edonoiz 'any time at all', edonola 'anyhow', edozein 'any'.
    The third group are polarity items, and they correspond to English forms
in 'any-' in that function (see 3.1.2.4). In principle, they are formed by pre-
fixing e- to the interrogative, but there are numerous complications, and
northern varieties sometimes use unrelated forms in this function. Exam-
ples: ezer 'anything' (but also northern deus), inor (northern nehor) 'any-
body', inon (northern nehon) 'anywhere', inoiz (northern nehoiz) 'ever' (but
also sekula[n]), inola (northern nehola) 'in any way'. The form ezein 'any',
from zein 'which?', is now archaic.
    All the members of this third group are frequently reinforced by the par-
ticle ere 'also' (B bere or be). They occur in polarity contexts, typically un-
der negation and in questions:(121) Ez dut ezer(ere) ikusi.
      not AUX anything see
      Ί didn't see anything.'","[184, 185, 186]"
"    As in Lekeitio and Tolosa, younger speakers may pronounce interroga-
tives with final raising intonation. Repeat or echo-questions have similar
properties to those in the dialects of Lekeitio and Tolosa. The same patterns
as in the other dialects are also found in exhortative and exclamative utter-
ances.
   Adverbial adjunct clauses separated from the main clause by a break dis-
play a continuative type of intonation. These phrases have a higher pitch
level than the matrix clause. There is pitch rise on the penultimate syllable
of the first word, and a further rising onto the last syllable. This pitch level
is then maintained for the rest of the adverbial clause, until the last word,
which presents a fall in pitch on the final syllable, i.e., as if it were the last
word in a phrase with main prominence. The last syllable presents a contour
intonation, however, as there is a rise in pitch at the end. This pattern is il-
lustrated in Fig. 32, for sentence (61):(61) Gure αηάϊα allägatu denean,         Amagoiakin    gan garά.
     our brother arrive      AUX.when Amagoya.COM go AUX
     'When our brother arrived, we left with Amagoia.'

                               Morphology
3.1. The Noun Phrase: nouns, determiners and modifiers; pronouns and
     names
     R.L. Trask3.1.1. Introduction3.1.1.1. The basicsIt is convenient to present the structure of the noun phrase in the form of a
template; an asterisk marks an element that may occur more than once:Complex Modifier* - DETI - Ν - ADJ* - DET2The positioning of degree modifiers is complex and variable, and is de-
scribed in section 3.1.3.4. Any case-marker is suffixed to the end of the NP,
as described in section 3.2. Number-marking is possible only in the DET2
position, as explained below. Consequently, any number-marking or case-
marking which is present appears only once, at the end of the noun phrase;
there is no NP-intemal agreement, and nouns cannot in fact be directly in-
flected at all: in Basque, it is noun phrases, and only noun phrases, which
can be inflected.
   The only obligatory element is a determiner. With only minor exceptions,
an NP always contains a determiner; with just two significant exceptions, an
NP contains only one determiner. Here we use the label determiner in a
maximally broad sense, to include all of the following: (a) articles; (b) de-
monstratives; (c) the partitive marker; (d) numerals; (e) quantifiers; (f) inter-
rogatives; (g) certain indefinite determiners.
   A noun phrase may, of course, consist merely of a pronoun or a proper
name; pronouns are treated in section 3.1.6 and proper names in section
3.1.7.
   As a rule, Basque has no grammatical gender and no noun classes, and
there are no classifiers. With only trivial phonological complications, all
noun phrases are constructed and inflected identically, except that animate
noun phrases form their local cases somewhat differently from inanimate
114   Morphology
 noun phrases; see section 3.1.1.2 for an account, and see section 3.2.2.4 for
 the list of forms.
     The head of a noun phrase is the noun, if there is one, but see section
 3.1.5 for headless NPs. The class of nouns is large and open, and nouns are
 generally sharply distinct from other parts of speech, though see section
 3.1.3.1 for a sample of words which can be either nouns or adjectives.
 Words formed with the word-forming suffix -dun 'having, who has' can be
 either nouns or adjectives. For example, from euskara 'Basque language',
 the derivative euskaldun can be either a noun meaning 'Basque-speaker,
 Basque' or an adjective meaning 'Basque-speaking'.
     A noun may be monomorphemic, like neska 'girl' or zur 'wood'. It may
 be derived from another word by means of a noun-forming suffix, like eder-
 tasun 'beauty' (from eder 'beautiful'), ikusmen 'vision' (from ikusi 'see'),
 or jendetza 'crowd' (from jende 'people'). Or it may be compound in form,
like eskulan 'handicraft' (from esku 'hand' plus lan 'work'), logela 'bed-
room' (from lo 'sleep' [n.] plus gela 'room'), gurpide 'cartpath' (from gurdi
 'cart' plus bide 'road'), or the remarkable eztabaida 'argument, dispute'
(from the two complete sentences Ez da! Bai da! 'No, it isn't! Yes, it is!')
Sometimes a compound is written as two words; for example, 'sunflower'
may appear either as eguzkilore or as eguzki lore (eguzki 'sun' plus lore
 'flower'), and 'old people's home' may be zaharretxe or zahar etxe (zahar
 'old [person]' plus etxe 'house').
    Nouns are divided into countable and uncountable nouns, and, as a rule,
an uncountable noun may not be the head of an NP which is overtly marked
for plural number. Observe, however, that many uncountable nouns can be
pluralized to give an individuating sense. For example, ogi 'bread' is un-
countable as a generic, but is countable when it means 'loaf: ogiak 'loaves
of bread'. As in other languages, there are a few nouns which are idiosyn-
cratic in this respect: for example, the Romance loan jende 'people' is un-
countable in Spanish Basque (like Peninsular Spanish gente), but countable
in French Basque (like French gens). There are a few pluralia tantum, such
as guraizeak 'scissors' and frakak ~ prakak 'trousers'. Some words are re-
gionally variable here: the nouns aza 'cabbage', orga 'cart, wagon', hilerri
'cemetery' and ote ~ ota 'gorse' are pluralia tantum for some speakers only:
azak, orgak, hilerriak, otak. But other words are ordinary count nouns, per-
haps unexpectedly, like haitzur 'large shears'. Neologisms are variable:
'spectacles' is a count noun betaurreko for some speakers but a plurale tan-
tum betaurrekoak for others.
    The language is rich in abstract nouns, such as bizitza 'life', bakardade
'solitude', edertasun 'beauty' and zikinkeria 'filth, lewdness, depravity', but
                                                            The noun phrase   115
 these do not differ at all from other nouns in their grammatical behavior,
 though of course most of them cannot be counted. Nouns denoting activities
 and events, such as lurrikara 'earthquake' (lur 'land, soil, earth' plus ikara
  'tremor'), korrika 'race' (competition) and desegite 'destruction' are nu-
 merous and totally unremarkable. Collective nouns like komite 'committee'
 and ekipo '(sports) team' are ordinary countable nouns, and they likewise
 exhibit no distinctive behavior. Mass nouns like gari 'wheat' and elur
 'snow' are ordinary uncountable nouns, and the language has no distinct
 singulative forms; related individuating nouns are constructed by ordinary
 lexical means, as in galburu 'head of wheat' (gal- 'wheat' plus buru 'head')
 and elurluma 'snowflake' (elur 'snow' plus luma 'feather').
     Noteworthy is the presence of a set of spatial nouns, such as aurre 'front,
 space in front o f , atze 'space behind' and inguru 'vicinity'; these are ordi-
nary nouns, but their case-inflected forms constitute the largest group of
postpositions in the language, as explained in section 3.3.1, and in postposi-
 tional use they exhibit a few idiosyncrasies.
     Dvandva compounds are almost invariably plural in form, like aitamak
 'parents' (aita 'father' plus ama 'mother'), hortz-haginak 'teeth' (hortz
 'molar' plus hagin 'incisor'), and plater-pitxeruak 'crockery' {plater 'plate'
plus pitxeru 'pitcher'). Noteworthy is the case of Bizkai-Gipuzkoetan 'in
Bizkaia and Gipuzkoa', again with a plural ending (see section 3.8.1).
     Otherwise, there are no irregular nouns in standard Basque (although in
local varieties one sometimes finds nouns which are exceptional in the mor-
phophonological rules they trigger in combination with inflectional suf-
fixes). As in Spanish, nouns of foreign origin lose all trace of their foreign
inflections, except sometimes for gender in loans from Spanish (see section
3.1.1.3); for example, fenomeno 'phenomenon' and erradio 'radius' behave
just like any other noun.","[141, 142, 143, 144, 145]"
"In (1902), the dative NP is the first person singular. The personal pronoun
as such has no overt realization within the sentence, but appears as the first
demonstrative (honi) after the relative.
   Usually the whole phrase is appositive (see 4.10.3.3.4), and follows the
personal pronoun it its plain form. Both NPs, the personal pronoun and the
appositive phrase, bear the same case marker:(1903) Baina        nik,      [karismarik(...)   hartu ez dudan]
       but          I.ERG     charisma.PRTT      take not AUX.COMP

        'But I, who have not received any charisma, only have the present
        and the past before my eyes.' [Mitx. IH:392]Observe that in (1902) and (1903) both the verb within the relative (naizen,
hartu ez dudan) and the verb of which the personal pronoun is the argument
in the main sentence (didazu, ditut) agree with the first person. Therefore, it
can be said that, although personal pronouns cannot be used as relative
heads, they can be relativized.
    Some grammarians have claimed that it is possible to use some intensive
pronouns bearing a local case ending as head of relatives. These pronouns
are morphologically complex and result from the adjunction of the demon-
strative to the personal pronoun itself (in its emphatic form): for instance,
nerau (<neur + hau) for the first person singular. Although such constructs
are somewhat easier to accept than those where the head is an unmarked
personal pronoun, the result is still bad, and speakers can hardly employ
such forms:
                                                                         Subordination   789

"
3.2.2. Inflectional suffixes for case and number3.2.2.1. Basic morphological paradigmsAs indicated above, although case and number inflection in Basque is
phrasal in scope, it is morphologically expressed by means of bound forms
attached to the last word in the noun phrase.
    As the examples above already show, demonstratives are inflected in a
somewhat different way from other words. Personal pronouns also show
minor idiosyncrasies. Other than this, nominal inflection is completely regu-
lar and uniform, in the sense that there is no lexical marking of nouns or ad-
jectives as requiring special forms of the inflectional suffixes or as belong-
ing to different inflectional classes. The number/case inflectional endings
are the same for all nouns and adjectives. Regarding the shape of the inflec-
tional endings, a distinction, however, must be made between stems ending
in a vowel and stems ending in a consonant. Also among vowel-final stems,
172   Morphology
those ending in -a present certain morphophonological peculiarities (in
many dialects there are further morphophonological complications, see 3.2.6
below). We will first describe the morphophonology of case and number in-
flection in a systematic way, presenting complete inflectional paradigms.
Then, we will examine the morphology and use of each case suffix sepa-
rately.
   Four morphological subparadigms are distinguished. First, indefinite
forms are distinguished from definite forms; definite forms, in their turn,
may be singular or plural; and within the plural, in addition to the general
plural, there is a proximal plural form.
   The inflectional paradigm of the word leku 'place' is given in table 59 as
an example of a nominal stem ending in a nonlow vowel. Again, what we
mean by the inflectional paradigm of the word leku is the set of forms that
this word will take when not followed by any other word within the noun
phrase. The labels definite, indefinite, singular and plural as well as the case
labels on the left column must be understood as applying to the noun phrase
ending in the word given as an example. As explained in section 3.1.1.1, in-
definite forms cannot appear by themselves, and, in order to constitute a
complete noun phrase, must be accompanied by a numeral, quantifier, in-
definite or interrogative determiner (e.g. zazpi leku 'seven places', zenbait
lekutan 'in several places', edozein lekutara 'to any place', zenbat lekure-
kin? 'with how many places?')
    Nouns/adjectives ending in -a lose this vowel when followed by a vowel-
initial inflectional suffix. As an example of noun ending in -a, the word
hondartza 'beach, sandy place' is given in table 60.
    In Bizkaian and some Gipuzkoan varieties, stem-final /a/ raises to /e/ be-
fore the singular article /-a/. The resulting sequence -ea has undergone fur-
ther changes in different western varieties. Thus, for instance, for alaba
'daughter', we find the following absolutive singular forms: Arratia alabea,
Getxo alabe, Lekeitio alabia, Gernika alabie, Ondarroa alabi. In a couple of
villages on the boundary of the western area where -a-a > -e-a and the area
where -a-a > -a, forms with -aa are found; e.g.: alabaa 'the daughter'. In
the plural, on the other hand, there is no rising of stem-final /a/ in any dia-
lect. In a few conservative western varieties (Onati), we find the historical
long vowel unchanged in the absolutive plural; e.g.: alabaak (vs. singular
alabia in this dialect), elsewhere the sequence has been reduced: Arratia,
Getxo, Lekeitio, etc: alabak (so that, e.g., in Leketio ergative singular ala-
biek contrasts with absolutive and ergative plural aläbak).
   In Zuberoan and the extinct Roncalese dialect, the sequence -a-a has
been reduced, but memory of the historical sequence is accentually pre-
                                                                           Postpositions   173
served by attraction of the accent; e.g.: Ζ alhäba 'daughter', alhabä 'the
daughter' < *alhaba-a, (vs. gizuna 'the man'), alhabäk 'the daughters' (see
section 2.2.4). In Salazarese, an epenthetic -r- is inserted in the absolutive
singular of stems ending in a low vowel: alabara 'the daughter'.","[201, 202, 203]"
"
3.1.1.2. AnimacyAnimate noun phrases exhibit a peculiarity in the formation of their local
cases. An animate noun phrase is one denoting a human being or a larger
animal, and it is, of course, the animacy of the head noun that determines
the animacy of the whole noun phrase (even in headless NPs; see section
3.1.5). Speakers are uncertain about the animacy of small creatures like
birds, crustaceans and insects, but names of these creatures very rarely occur
in the local cases anyway, except in fables, in which case the creatures are
personified and of course their names are treated as animate.
116   Morphology
     As a rule, animate noun phrases are inflected just like inanimate ones:
hence, with mendia 'the mountain', we have absolutive plural mendiak and
ergative plural mendiek, and, with gizona 'the man', we have absolutive plu-
ral gizonak and ergative plural gizonek, and so on. However, animate NPs
frequently form all their local cases differently from inanimate NPs. Hence,
 'in/on the mountains' is mendietan, but 'in/on the men' is commonly
gizonengan (or northern gizonen baitan). See section 3.2.2.4 for the forms.
The local cases are the Locative, the Ablative, the Allative, and the com-
pound cases formed on the Allative: Directional, Terminative and Destina-
tive. This distinction is adhered to rather rigorously in western dialects, but
less so in eastern dialects. Eastern varieties sometimes use inanimate forms
with animate NPs, above all when the local sense is abstract or metaphori-
cal, rather than literal. For example, we find the following:(62) Nik ez dut konfidentzirik      honelako gizonetan.
     I   not have confidence.PRTT such         man.PL.LOC.
     Ί don't have any confidence in men like that'. [Xalbador]But even literal senses sometimes appear with inanimate inflections:(63) Hura    zalu, goait   zagozkon senar       eta haurretarat.
      s/he   agile wait    were       husband   and child.PL.ALL
      'She hurried off to the husband and children who were waiting for
      her.' [Hiriart Urruty]This eastern usage is particularly common when the NP is plural and generic,
or when it is a personal pronoun, but it is not confined to such cases.
   But, in all varieties, an animate noun phrase regularly takes the inanimate
forms of certain local cases to provide the special sense of 'among'. Thus,
the ordinary locative of zazpi alabak 'the seven daughters' is zazpi alaben-
gan 'in/on the seven daughters', but the inanimate form zazpi alabetan
means 'among the seven daughters'. Likewise, gizonak 'the men' forms an
ordinary ablative gizonengandik 'from the men', but inanimate gizonetatik
means 'from among the men'.","[145, 146]"

4.1.5. Ditransitive Structures4.1.5.1. Trivalent ditransitiveIn this group we include all those verbs that can increase their valency with
the addition of a dative-marked argument fulfilling the role of recipient or
beneficiary. They all have therefore a more basic transitive bivalent use. I
exclude from the group those ditransitives that encode a possession relation
between the dative and some other argument of the verb (see section 4.1.6),
the so-called 'datives of interest'. Verbs in this group are (among many oth-
ers) eman 'give', erosi 'buy', saldu 'sell', esan 'tell', eskeini 'offer', era-
kutsi 'show', ekarri 'bring', kontatu 'tell', esan 'say' and erantzun 'answer'.
They all involve a notion of transfer from an agent or causer to a recipient
or beneficiary. Verbs that cannot be interpreted as involving a transfer can
have ditransitive forms, but they are invariably of the possessive sort.
   The dative argument is doubly marked by case on the noun-phrase and
dative affixes on the auxiliary (see section 4.1.3.6.2 for important restric-
tions; also Albizu 1997a):(642) a. Jonek      ardoa ekarri du.
           Jon.ERG  wine bring AUX.TR
         'Jon brought (the) wine.'
      b. Jonek      Mireni       ardoa ekarri       dio.

4.10.3.1.6. Morphosyntactic secondary effects linked to relativization hier-
            archyBasque has developed more or less marginal ways to lighten the problems
linked to relativization of non-grammatical phrases. We mention three of
them: -ko insertion, use of resumptive pronouns, and non-argumental verb-
inflection.
4.10.3.1.6.1. -ko insertionThe relational suffix -ko is used to make possible for adverbial phrases, and
especially locative phrases, to function as adnominals. As observed above,
relativization of locative phrases, though possible, has some restrictions.
But joining -ko to a relative clause permits the speaker to indicate that the
locative interpretation of the relativized phrase is required. From the point
of view of syntactic analysis, the relative is adverbialized as a headless rela-
tive with a locative case: a possibility which is generally restricted to tem-
poral phrases. Adnominalization of the headless relative is then realized by
means of the relational suffix. Consider the following example:
782   Syntax
(1885)    [Ό soak     iragaiten  direneko]          haroa       ten.
          doves      pass.IMPF   AUX.COMP.REL       season was
          'It was the season when pidgeons arrive' [Sarri. Afar.: 10]Without adjunction of -eko to the relative clause, (1885), where the relativ-
ized NP is a locative, would be grammatically correct, but more difficult to
interpret. The relational suffix can be added to a plural form:(1886)     [pastoralak eman zirenetako]            herri-izenen
           pastorals     give AUX.COMP.PL.REL village-names.GEN
           beste zerrenda
           other list
         'the other list of the names of villages where pastorals have been
         presented' [Leku. Ahozko:221]
4.10.3.1.6.2. Resumptive pronounsSince verb-agreement occurs with all grammatical NPs (absolutive, ergative
and dative), it can be considered as a kind of resumptive realization of the
relativized grammatical NP. We won't discuss this point here, restricting re-
sumptive pronouns to independently realized true pronominal forms.
    In many languages, resumptive pronouns provide a strategy to facilitate
the interpretation of relativized adverbial or genitive phrases. Actually, this
strategy has been proposed for Basque by some modern grammarians and
among them especially Altube (1929, §125). However, using resumptive
pronouns in relative clauses doesn't represent a strategy Basque-speakers
usually resort to, even with adverbial phrases which are hard to relativize.
Nevertheless, resumptive pronouns are more readily accepted when the rela-
tivized NP is embedded within another NP or clause.
    The distal demonstrative Qtura) or its emphatic form (bera) can be used
as resumptive pronouns. In (1887) we have an example where the resump-
tive pronoun bears a non-subcategorized complex case (comitative with
ezkondu 'marry'). Out of context, the example is accepted by some speak-
ers, but it is doubtful the construction is used in natural speech situations:(1887)   %Amerikara   joan da   [berarekin          ezkondu
         Americas.ALL go   AUX him.COM              marry
         nahi izan zenuen]    mutila.
         will   have   AUX.COMP     boy
         'The boy to whom you wanted to get married to went to America.'
                                                              Subordination   783
The status of (1887) is not clear, though some people consider such use of
resumptive pronouns acceptable. Observe that, without the resumptive (ber-
arekin 'with him'), the example would be rejected by most speakers.
Resumptive pronouns are more readily used when embedded within other
phrases within the relative. Consider the following example taken from a
TV show:(1888)    [Harekin gustora egotea              lortzen
          her.COM      well       be.NOM.DET succeed.LMPF
          dudan]        lehengo neska da.
          AUX.COMP first            girl  is
         'She is the first girl with whom I succeed in feeling good.'
         [ETB, Jaun eta jabe, 96/04/06]In (1888) harekin is a resumptive pronoun which makes interpretation of the
relative clause easier. The resumptive pronoun is not an immediate constitu-
ent of the relative clause, since it belongs to a nominalized clause embedded
within the relative. The fact that the relativized NP is deeply embedded
within the relative makes the use of a resumptive pronoun more natural.","[811, 812, 813]"
" Verb glosses
Verbal inflection in finite verbal forms is also glossed in detail only where
 directly relevant. Since the only relevant information, outside the chapter on
 verbal morphology itself, is person agreement (including person, case and
number morphemes) only that information is specified. Unless PL 'plural' in
explicitly marked, 'singular' is the default value. We have tried to represent
person agreement information in the order in which it appears on the verb.
Thus, subjects will be variously marked to the right or to the left, depending
on whether they are cross-referenced by the ergative or the absolutive
marker. Person morphemes are separated by slashes from each other in
pluripersonal agreement forms. Mood is only marked when the potential or
hypothetical marker -ke is present or when the subjunctive auxiliary is se-
lected, if directly relevant. Where none of this is relevant, only 'AUX' has
been indicated. Full information is given in 3.5.2.
    As for aspect information, following Basque grammatical tradition, we
gloss perfective participles as infinitives. This is so because they work as
the unmarked, citation form of the verb. Thus, a form like hartu is glossed
as 'take'. Similarly, the future morpheme -ko is added to this citation, parti-
cipial form, and we gloss hartuko as take.FUT, disregarding again the 'per-
fective' aspect marker -tu-. The auxiliary izan 'be' reinforcing perfective
tenses (3.5.4.2.1) or inserted to provide a verbal host for aspectual markers
in verbal locutions (3.5.4.2.2) is always glossed as 'be' regardless of its
grammatical function.
    The perfective present form ikusi dut can be translated as a present per-
fect of simple past in English. Both translations are given for this tense
throughout the grammar. The different tense values are described in 3.5.4.
Finally, some verbal expressions can be analyzed as regular verb+auxiliary
                                                           Notes on glosses ix
combinations or as noun/adjective + 'be, have' periphrases: bizi naiz Ί live,
be alive', nahi dut Ί want, have desire'. We have maintained the different
authors' preferences in this area.

                             Introduction
                                J. I. Hualde1.1. The Basque language and its nameThe word 'Basque' derives, through French, from the name of the Vas-
cones, a nation or tribe that in Roman times occupied an area of the Iberian
Peninsula including most of present-day Navarre and neighboring parts of
Aragon. Whereas, on the one hand, possibly not all Vascones were Basque-
speaking (both non-Indo-European Iberian and Indo-European Celtiberian
appear to have been used in parts of their territory) and, on the other hand,
Pre-Basque and related languages seem to have been also spoken by some
other neighboring nations (at least the Aquitanians in Gaul, see Gorro-
chategui 1995), in medieval times the name Vascones became identified
with the speakers of the direct ancestor of the language we know as Basque.
The traditional name for the Basque language in Spanish is vascuence, de-
rived from Latin uasconice '(to speak) in the Vasconic way', which is paral-
lel to and was opposed to romance < romanice 'in the Roman way'. In post-
Renaissance Spain, the name vizcaino, strictly speaking only the western-
most dialect of Basque, became for several centuries a frequent designation
for the Basque language and its speakers.
    The Basques call their language euskara (and dialectal variants: euskera,
eskuara, iiskara, auskera, etc.). Euskara is opposed to erdara (or erdera)
'foreign language', used to refer to Spanish on the southern side of the po-
litical border and to French on the other side. Both words have an ending
which very likely derives from the word era 'manner', used as a suffix in
many words, such as ibilera 'way of walking' (from ibil-i 'to walk'), etc. In
erdara the first element appears to be erdi 'half. Etymologically erdara
would thus be 'a half way of speaking', 'something that is not fully a lan-
guage'; a not unusual way to characterize a foreign language. On the other
hand, the original meaning of the root eusk- in euskara is less clear. Among
the proposed etymologies we find the name of the Ausci, a Pyrenean tribe in
Roman times, and the reconstructed verb *enau(t)s-i 'to speak' (Irigoyen
1977, 1990).
2 Introduction
    Basque speakers refer to the land where their language is spoken as
Euskal Herria (euskal = compositional form of euskara + herri 'country' +
-a 'singular determiner') 'country of the Basque language' and to them-
selves as euskaldunak 'those who have the Basque language' (euskal- +
-dun 'possessing' + -ak 'plural determiner').
   In the first decades of the 20th century, the eminent Basque politician and
not-so-eminent philologist Sabino Arana Goiri (1865-1903) and his follow-
ers changed the spelling to euzkera in the (mistaken) belief that this word
must be related to eguzki (dialectal euzki) 'sun', on the Classical Greek
model that sought a connection between Hellen and helios. Related coinages
of that vintage are the words Euzkadi 'Basque Country', later reformed as
Euskadi, the adjective euzko (later eusko) 'Basque, in an ethnic or political
sense' and euzkotar (later euskotar) 'Basque citizen; ethnic Basque'. The
truly great and very influential Basque linguist Luis Michelena (in Basque
Koldo Mitxelena) promoted the use of some of these neologisms to preserve
the traditional link between euskal and the Basque language. His wish was
to avoid the misuse of words like euskaldun, which traditionally can only
mean 'Basque speaker', as 'Basque citizen'. He succesfully campaigned for
terms like Eusko jaurlaritza 'Basque government' instead of Euskal jaur-
laritza, which in the Sprachgeflihl of traditional Basque speakers could only
mean something like 'Government of the Basque language' (see Michelena
1984).","[8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32]"
"(2151) Miren Paristik    edo Erromatik    etorri zen.
       Miren Paris.from or      Rome.from come AUX
       'Miren came from Paris or Rome.'
860 Syntax
4.11.3.1. Coordination in noun phrasesProblems arise when we want to determine which elements smaller than
postpositional phrases or case-marked noun phrases can be coordinated.
Case endings are attached to the end of the noun phrase. As shown in 3.1,
the structure of the noun phrase can be analyzed by means of the following
template:   Complex Modifier* Adjl Detl Ν Adj2*                 Det2The first situation under study is the possibility of coordinating two noun
phrases under a single case ending:   [NP and NP] CaseIn this pattern, different degrees of unacceptability arise, depending on the
nature and the structure of the noun phrases conjoined. It is never possible
to coordinate noun phrases ending with demonstratives (2152) or plural ar-
ticles (2153), and the same is true of personal pronouns (2154):(2152)    *Irakasleek     neska   hura     eta   mutil    hari
          teachers.ERG    girl    this     and   boy      that.DAT
         deitu   diete.
         call    AUX
         'The teachers have called this girl and that boy.'","[889, 890]"
"
4.10.3.1.1.4. Left- and right-branchingIn the examples above, the relative clauses precede the head. Indeed, the
prenominal position of relatives is the unmarked position in Basque, almost
obligatory for many speakers in present-day Basque. This is reminiscent of
what happens with genitive phrases, and the complementizer employed in
relatives (-(e)n) has often been considered to be cognate with the genitive
marker (-en), though this remains doubtful, because, unlike the genitive, the
complementizer doesn't seem to be syllabic in its underlying form (-«).
    In the past, another word order could be used, and can still be used as a
marked form in modern eastern dialects. In this case the relative clause is
still embedded, but, like an adjective, it follows the head. See (1851):
766   Syntax
(1851)    [Eskualdun zahar [zerbait    dakite-n]         -ak]    aide
          Basque       old   something k n o w - c O M P -DET.PL side
          dituzte.
          have
         'The old Basques who know something have them on their side.'
         [Etch. Bur.-ΛΠ] In (1851) the head is eskualdun 'Basque', and the relative clause follows it
 (after the adjective zahar 'old').
    Observe that in (1851) the relative clause precedes the determiner (-ak),
 which must be at the end of the whole NP. Thus, there is no extraposition of
the relative clause. Actually the relative clause occupies the position that ad-
jectives have in Basque, i.e. to the right of the head-noun, but before the de-
terminer. Thus we have a case of right-branching with regard to the lexical
head of the phrase (the bare noun), but not with regard to its functional head
(the determiner). Hence, the relative clause in (1851) is not the last syntactic
constituent within the whole NP because it is followed by the determiner,
which is actually suffixed to it (-ak).
    One should not analyze (1851) as a relative clause having an internal
head. If this were the case, the head (euskalduri) would have the ergative
case-marker which corresponds to it within the relative. Basque doesn't al-
low this relativization strategy.
    Postnominal embedded relatives share all the properties prenominal rela-
tives have, and they must not be considered on a par with the extraposed
relatives studied below.","[795, 796]"
"
4.10.3.4.1.1. The relative pronounThe relative pronouns are zein 'which' (in all cases) and no- (only for local
cases). When used as a relative pronoun, zein appears in two forms depend-
ing on the dialect and the type of case it takes, but without any other conse-
quences being related to this difference. In the first alternative, the pronoun
zein receives directly the case ending (indefinite declension); in the second
possibility, the definite article is joined to the pronoun (singular or plural
declension).
   In the eastern tradition the favored form, though not the sole one, was the
indefinite zein (or zoin, the easternmost form) among writers of the 16th and
17th centuries. From the 18th century on, zeina(k) became the most widely
used form in Lapurdian texts. In western texts, zein and zeintzuk were the
most widely used forms. In all dialects, local pronouns {non, nondik, nora,
noraino) were generally employed, though zein(a) with a local case ending
(zeinetan, zeinetarik, zeinetara, zeinetaraino) could be used as well. Here
are some examples of the different types of pronouns:
                                                                     Subordination 811
- Indefinite zein. In (1958) the relative pronoun is absolutive indefinite. The
example is written in a dialect close to Zuberoan. In the Bizkaian example
in (1959) the relative pronoun receives the comitative ending (-gaz).","[840, 841]"
"
3.7. Derivation
     J.I. HualdeAlmost all productive derivation in Basque is accomplished by means of
suffixes. Derivational suffixation is a robust feature of Basque. There is a
rather large group of derivational suffixes, which include both native mate-
rial and suffixes borrowed at various times from Latin and Romance. An
exhaustive description of derivational suffixes would surpass the limits of
this work. In this section only the most common derivational suffixes are
presented. For more detailed studies of Basque derivational morphology,
Azkue (1923-25[1969]) and Mugica [Mujika] (1978, 1982) may be con-
sulted.
    Sometimes classificatory doubts arise as to whether a given item should
be considered a derived word or a compound. This is the case, for instance,
with words with -zale 'fond of as second element; e.g.: neskazale 'fond of
girls, womanizer', ardozale 'fond of wine'. Whereas the most normal usage
of zale is in such formations, it can also appear as a separate word in west-
ern dialects (oso zalea da 's/he is very fond of it') and also occurs as a stem
in derived words such as zale(tu) 'become fond of and zaletasun 'fond-
ness' .
                                                                   Derivation   329    In some cases what originally was an independent word is, from a syn-
chronic point of view, better seen as a derivational suffix. An example is -
dun 'having' (originally from the verb du 's/he has it' plus the relative suffix
-,η), which gives rise to formations such as dirudun 'having money,
wealthy' (An alternative etymology for -dun due to de Rijk is the participle
 *edun 'have') . In other cases, a suffix has become an independent word.
This is the case with the suffix -(t)asun '-ness' (perhaps of Latin origin)
which has been promoted to the status of an independent word, tasun 'qual-
ity, feature'. Given the existence of the word tasun it is not obvious that
words such as anaitasun 'brotherhood', askatasun 'freedom', etc., should be
considered derived words instead of compounds.
    Several words which are frequently used as second members of com-
pounds have acquired an initial dental or velar consonant, which originally
had an epenthetical function in some of the compounds in which they occur.
The new consonant-initial form may coexist with the older vowel-initial one
with somewhat different meanings or, in some cases, the older form may
have been replaced. For instance, together with ume 'child; offspring', in
some western dialects we find the word kume 'offspring of an animal' which
undoubtedly derives from reanalysis in words like katakume 'kitty', where
the -k- , was originally epenthetical (perhaps by analogy with some other
word). Another example is tegi 'place; storage room; stable', which most
likely derives from an earlier *egi, its initial t- being the result of reanalysis
in compounds such txerri-tegi 'pig-sty' or lora-tegi 'garden' (flower-place).
Forms like jauregi 'palace' (lord-place), with the older form -egi, would
perhaps have to be considered derived words synchronically, since egi does
not have independent existence nowadays. Another word that has acquired
an initial consonant in this manner is kide 'companion' (cf., e.g. adiskide
'friend' [adin 'age'], lankide 'coworker' [lan 'work'] but ahaide 'relative',
haurride 'sibling' [haur 'child'], gogaide 'person with similar ideas' [gogo
'soul']). Most likely talde 'group' is etymologically related to aide 'side' in
the same manner, although synchronically they must be considered separate
items.
   The reasons for the classificatory doubts may also be of a semantic na-
ture. Thus, whereas the word bide 'path, way' is well attested as a free form,
as a bound element it often has the meaning of 'method' when attached to a
verb; e.g.: ikasbide 'method for learning', aurkibide 'table of contents'
(aurki[tu] 'find'), (vs., e.g. ardi-bide 'sheep path', which is a clear com-
pound).
   The classificatory problem, then, is whether morphologically complex
words like ardozale 'fond of wine', garbitasun 'cleanliness, quality of being
330   Morphology
clean', ikasbide 'method for learning' or lorategi 'garden' should be treated
as compounds or as derived words. Basque grammarians do not always
agree in the classification as compounds or derived words of many of these
examples. Here we have followed our own criterion in individual cases.
   For presentational purposes, derivational suffixes are classified by the
class of word to which they (most frequently) give rise (i.e. derived nouns,
derived adjectives, etc.) and within each of these types by their most usual
source (e.g. denominal, deverbal, etc.). The few derivational prefixes that
are found are illustrated at the end of the section. A special case is that of
diminutive suffixes, since these never change the category of the word they
are joined to. In a sense, then, diminutives occupy a position between inflec-
tion and derivation. These suffixes are treated first.
   Several caveats are in order:
— A certain degree of arbitrariness is involved in classifying a given suffix
as denominal, deverbal, etc. Sometimes a suffix is used with more than one
type of stem. In other cases, beside a regular pattern, there are more-or-less
exceptional formations where the stem belongs to a different category.
— Classification of a given suffix as noun-deriving or adjective-deriving is
not always a straightforward matter.
— A number of suffixes have more than one usage or meaning.
   These details are made explicit in the description of each suffix. The
classificatory labels used in this section represent only the unmarked or
most common case for each suffix.","[358, 359, 360]"
"(79) Oso on-a-k        dira.
     very good.DET.PL are
     'They're very good.'(j) in most vocative NPs, as in Bai, gizon-a 'Yes, sir' or Ume-a-k, etorri
    hona! 'Come here, children.'(k) in the citation form of a noun or adjectiveThe use of noun phrases without determiners is explained in 3.1.2.8. For de-
tails on the use of the determiner in nominal predicates, see 4.2.1.
    Save only in the easternmost dialects, a Basque asked for a Basque noun
or adjective will invariably cite this with the article, and hence will give
gizona for 'man' and gorria for 'red'. Some early dictionaries do the same.
Linguists and modern dictionaries cite forms without the article, and would
hence provide gizon and gorri for these examples. Speakers at the eastern
extreme of the country also cite words without the article.
    Note that a Basque NP with the definite article may or may not corre-
spond to a definite NP in English: thus, ura may correspond either to 'water'
or to 'the water', and umeak may correspond either to 'children' or to 'the
children'. So, depending on context, Umeak maite ditut may translate either
as Ί love children' or as Ί love the children'.
122   Morphology
3.1.2.2.2. The proximate plural articleWestern varieties (only) have, alongside the ordinary plural article -ak, a
proximate plural article -ok. In these varieties, gizonak means '(the) men',
while gizonok variously means 'we men', 'you men', or 'the men here'. In
case-inflection, the plural marker -e- which normally appears in all the
oblique plural forms is replaced by -o- in the proximate plural: hence, etxee-
tan 'in the houses', but etxeotan 'in the houses here'. The proximate plural
is also found in some eastern varieties in early literature, but it is extinct in
the east today. As a rule, there is no corresponding proximate singular in the
modern language, but a proximate singular, variously -ori, -or, -au or -o, is
attested in a number of varieties in early texts, and -o still exists marginally
in Bizkaian today, as in hemen berton 'right here', alongside hemen bertan.","[151, 152]"
"In the previous example, the personal pronoun is ergative (nik T ) , and is
followed by an appositive relative in which the first person (subject NP) is
relativized and receives the article followed by the ergative case-marker
(-ak). This kind of relative is often used when personal pronouns function as
vocatives. Sometimes the pronoun itself is gapped and the relative is em-
ployed alone, as in example (1906), where the whole vocative phrase is un-
derlined, and the relative clause is put between brackets:(1906) Emanen         ere     didazu,    \nere      bizi     zaren\-a,
          give.FUT    also    AUX        my         life     are.COMP-DET
          aurreko       egun    hartan        han          eman   zenidana.

         '(You), who are my life, you'll give me what you gave me that day.'
         [Gazt. Musi:201]In (1906) the vocative NP is the second person singular, but the pronoun
does not appear before the appositive phrase.",[819]
"
3.1.2.7. Indefinite and interrogative determinersBasque has a number of indefinite and interrogative determiners. All of
these are formally derived from indefinite and interrogative pronouns, and
their formation is accordingly described in sections 3.1.6.1.3 and 3.1.6.1.4,
but their syntax is described here.
   All the determiners described here occupy the DETl (preposed) position.
They include zein 'which?' (Northern zoin), zer 'what?', zenbat 'how
much? how many?' (variants zeinbat, zonbat, zomat), zeinnahi 'whichever
you like, any at all', edozein 'any' (free-choice, not polarity), hainbat and
hainbeste 'so many, that much' and the archaic ezein 'any' (polarity item).
Examples may be found in table 46.
   The items zein and zer have a special use in exclamations, corresponding
to English 'what' or 'how' in this function (4.6.1.1). Unusually, they fre-
quently, though not invariably, take the definite article in this function; in
central varieties, zer commonly occurs in its reduced prenominal form ze
(see table 47).
                                                                 The noun phrase   133

 zein ederra!                              'how beautiful!'","[162, 163]"
"
3.1.2.3.2. Intensive demonstrativesThe intensive suffix -xe can be added to a demonstrative to produce an in-
tensive form, as in hauxe, horixe, huraxe (B axe). Such forms are most typi-
cally used with noun phrases which are in focus (see also 4.4.7.2.2). Com-
pare the following two sentences, where liburu hau can be interpreted as a
topic while the intensive liburu hauxe is in focus:(80) Liburu hau erosi dut.
     book    this buy AUX
     Ί bought this book/This book I bought.'
124   Morphology
(81) Liburu hau-xe          erosi      dut.
      book      this.lNTS   buy        AUX
      Ί bought this very b o o k . '
   The suffix -xe normally precedes any case-suffix, and always so with an
ergative or genitive suffix, so that intensive hauxe has ergative honexek and
genitive honexeren. With other case-suffixes, some speakers place the -xe
after the case-suffix, and so the dative of hauxe may be either honexeri or
honixe.
   The form horixe is commonly used as a complete utterance expressing
strong agreement with a preceding statement, like English 'Exactly!' or
'That's it!'.","[153, 154]"
"
4.10.3.1.8. Restrictive vs. non-restrictive relative clausesIt is well known that some languages distinguish between restrictive and
non-restrictive relative clauses. Basque also makes such a distinction be-
cause, as will be seen further, appositive and extraposed relatives are non-
restrictive. However, embedded ordinary relatives don't distinguish between
the two kinds of interpretation, or, to put it in another way, ordinary rela-
tives can receive both interpretations depending on pragmatic factors. This
can be observed by checking whether there is any difference in relativiza-
tion when the head noun is a proper noun (non-restrictive interpretation),
and when it is a common noun which is specified by means of the relative
(restrictive interpretation). Compare the following examples:(1899) a.    Erakutsi didazun      gizonaz      mintzo naiz-
             show      AUX.COMP man.INSTR speak         am
            Ί am speaking about the man that you showed me.'
         b. Hainbeste miresten        duzun        Axularrez
             so.much    admire.IMPF AUX.COMP Axular.INSTR
             mintzo naiz-
             speak am
            Ί am speaking about Axular that you admire so much.'
                                                                Subordination 787
In the first sentence, the relative is restrictive: the NP is specified and its
specification results from the information given by the relative clause. In
contrast, in the second sentence the relative is non-restrictive, because the
head is a proper noun, which has its own specified reference. The informa-
tion given by the relative doesn't contribute to the specification of the NP.
As can be seen in the examples above, relativization is carried out in the
same way in both cases, and no formal difference is attached to the distinc-
tion between the two types of interpretation.
   The use of modifiers with proper nouns is stylistically rather marked, and
relative clauses are no exception. Here is an example of such a construction:(1900)    Eta   Arestik,     horren    oraintsuko        Arestik,
          and   Aresti.ERG   so       right.now.REL      Aresti.ERG

         'And Aresti, Aresti who is so modern, Aresti who we know so well,
         Aresti who speaks so loudly, (...) left many obscure passages.'
         [Mitx. EIG IV:81]
4.10.3.1.9. Relatives describing proper nounsPersonal pronouns are full NPs and they can receive no modifier at all.
Therefore no personal pronoun occurs as head of a relative clause:(1901)    *[Maite   zaitudan]            zurekin      ezkondu   nahi   dut.
          love      have.2A/lE.COMP you.COM marry               want   have
          Ί want to marry you whom I love so much.'","[816, 817]"
"In eastern varieties, a case-suffix may occasionally follow the reinforcing
ere, as in nehoneretik ez 'from nowhere at all', in place of nehondik ere ez-
    Basque has no negative pronouns or related forms, and these are ex-
pressed by combining the items in this third group with ez 'not', as in the
examples just given: inor ez 'nobody', ezer (ere) ez or deus ez 'nothing',
inola (ere) ez 'in no way', and so on. Exception: in eastern varieties, deus or
its extended form deusik can be used in isolation to express 'nothing', with-
out ez\ the same is not true of ezer.
    A negative may take a diminutive suffix, as in ezertxo ere ez 'absolutely
nothing'.
    An indefinite of the ezer type may be followed by guti ~ gutxi 'few, lit-
tle' to express 'hardly any...': inor gutxi 'hardly anybody', ezer gutxi 'hardly
                                                             The noun phrase   157anything'. A case-ending follows, as in Inor gutxik daki hori 'Hardly any-
body knows that'.
   The interrogative nor 'who' functions as an indefinite meaning 'the one,
the person' in locutions like this:(124) Μ ez naiz nor       hori egiteko.
      I not am      who that          do.NOM.REL
      Ί am not the one to do that/I am not the right person to do that.'","[186, 187]"

 zuek     'you' (plural)                   zuen    'your' (plural)In elevated styles, it is also possible, when the genitive is a personal pro-
noun, to invert the normal construction and to place the genitive after the
head noun, in which case the definite article must be used, even with a
proper name: aita gurea 'our father', Jon gurea 'our Jon'. This construction
is not normal in ordinary styles.
    In order to express a genitive-like relation which involves the notion of
location, Basque uses, not a genitive, but a -ko phrase. Compare the geni-
tives in etxearen izena 'the name of the house' and etxearen kolorea 'the
color of the house' with the -ko phrases in etxeko andrea 'the lady of the
house' and etxeko atea 'the door of the house'. In other words, Basque uses
a -ko phrase, rather than a genitive, to express the relations 'who/which is
located in', 'who lives in', 'who/which comes from', 'which forms part o f ,
and similar local notions. See the next section.
3.1.4.2. -ko phrasesThe relational suffix -ko is of central importance, and it is exceedingly fre-
quent. Its principal function may be readily described: any constituent of
adverbial function, regardless of its internal structure, may take the suffix
-ko to produce an adjectival modifier which precedes its head noun. The
only limitations on this process are semantic ones. The addition of -ko pro-
duces irregular phonological developments in certain cases: the final -n of a
                                                           The noun phrase   145
locative or comitative NP or of the manner suffix -lan is lost before -ko (ad-
verbs of place are sometimes exceptions), and the locative singular ending -
an disappears entirely. As usual, the plosive is voiced after /n/ or N.
   The suffix may be added to any of the following.(a) a simple lexical adverbatzo 'yesterday'; atzoko egunkaria 'yesterday's newspaper'
hemen 'here'; hemengo giroa 'the atmosphere here'
gero 'later, afterward'; geroko bizitza 'the afterlife'   The adverb orduan 'then', which is historically the locative singular of
the noun ordu 'hour', usually forms the -ko phrase orduko 'of that time'; see
(d) below.(b) an adverb of manner formed with -la(n)hola(n) 'thus, in this way' (from hon- 'this'); holako lana 'this kind of
work'; zelan 'how?' (from ze- interrogative); zelako pertsona? 'what kind
of person?'(c) a morphologically complex adverbzirt edo zart 'decisively', zirt-edo-zarteko gizona 'a decisive man'; hitzez

egiaz 'in truth, truly', egiazko esaldia 'a true statement'The combination -z-ko is in fact very common in deriving adjectives of ma-
terial, as in urrezko 'golden, made of gold', from urre 'gold', but is proba-
bly best regarded as a single distinct word-forming suffix, rather than as a
true -ko phrase — though note that such formations occupy the normal posi-
tion of a -ko phrase.(g) a postpositional phraselotsa gäbe 'without shame'; lotsagabeko emakume bat 'a shameless
woman'; gerra ondoan 'after the war'; gerra-ondoko mundua 'the post-war
world'(h) an adverb constructed from a determinerless NP or other sequence by
    means of the suffix -kaesku-huska 'bare-handed' (ADV) (from esku 'hand' plus huts 'bare' plus

bought yesterday'; ekarririk 'having (been) brought'; txoriak kabira ekar-
ririko abarra 'the branch brought to the nest by the bird'   In general, the -ta participle is used in the west, the -(r)ik participle in the
east and to some extent in B. This construction represents the only way in
which an adjectival participle can take arguments and adjuncts in western
varieties; see section 3.1.3.5 for an alternative construction in eastern dia-
lects, and see also section 3.1.4.4 for yet another possibility in eastern dia-
lects.(j) a finite adverbial clause (only in certain circumstances, notably with
temporal clauses, since most other formations would be senseless):

         'the season when doves pass over'(k) a finite complement clause in -la (only with a following head noun
    meaning 'story, report, rumor' or the like)(111)a. hil dute-la

         'that he has been killed'
      b. hil dutelako        kontua
              AUX.that.REL report
         'the report that he has been killed'    The only major exception is that -ko cannot be added to an adverb of
manner derived from an adjective, so that, for example, gaizki 'badly' (from
gaitz 'bad') cannot form *gaizkiko. But this restriction has an obvious se-
mantic basis: the non-existent *gaizkiko could have no meaning distinct
from that of gaitz.
    On occasion an adverbial source for the -ko phrase is difficult to identify:
ARGIA aldizkari-ko zuzendaria 'the editor of the magazine ARGIA'. Here
ARGIA aldizkaria 'the magazine ARGIA' takes the suffix -ko even though
there is no source: we cannot describe, the editor as being 'in' the magazine
(ARGIA aldizkariaren zuzendaria is also possible).
    There exists a second type of -ko phrase, quite different from the para-
digm cases described above and similar to descriptive genitives in other lan-
guages. Here the suffix is added, not to an adverbial, but to a determinerless
NP; this sequence must consist of at least two words (with a few exceptions
like adineko, edadeko 'elderly, of age'), it must express a quality or charac-
teristic, and there are obscure semantic restrictions:
148   Morphology
Table 51. -ko phrases
 hortz bi      'two teeth'       hortz biko sardea         'a two-pronged pitchfork'
 bihotz on     'good heart'      bihotz oneko neska bat    'a good hearted girl'
 hiru urte     'three years'     hiru urteko ume bat       'a three-year-old child'
 beso eder     'beautiful arm'   beso ederreko pilotaria   'a jai-alai-player with a great
                                                           arm'
    These formations have no adverbial source: we cannot, for example,
 speak of a child who is 'in three years' (hiru urtetan), and even if we could
the form is wrong: we would expect *hiru urtetako ume bat. This last is im-
possible in the western varieties from which the example is taken, though it
is possible in the east, and similar examples are found in early texts.
    In addition, we have a number of strictly lexicalized -ko phrases, such as
nahiko 'enough' (nahi 'want') and herriko 'popular, vernacular' (herri
 'people'); these have meanings which are at least partly opaque, and they
are therefore normally entered separately in dictionaries, but syntactically
they behave like other -ko phrases.
    We find a few other miscellaneous and idiosyncratic instances of -ko
phrases. A striking one is balizko 'hypothetical', which occurs in the famil-
iar proverb Balizko olak burdinarik ez Ά hypothetical forge doesn't [pro-
duce] any iron'; this derives from the finite verb-form balitz 'if it were'.
    Only in a handful of lexicalizations does a -ko phrase follow its head
noun. This occurs, for example, in Jaungoikoa 'God', from jaun 'lord' and
goiko, a -ko phrase formed from goian 'in a high place', and also in zezen-
suzko 'toro de fuego', from zezen 'bull' and the -ko phrase suzko, from su
'fire' and instrumental -z (this is a papier-mache figure of a bull covered in
fireworks and displayed at festivals). (Eastern varieties often prefer the more
regular suzko zezen.)
    See also section 3.1.7.1 for the occasional use of postposed -ko phrases in
personal names.
    See section 4.10.3 for the somewhat specialized use of -ko in relative
clauses.
                                                                       The noun phrase   149
3.1.4.3. Relative clausesThe formation of relative clauses is treated in detail in section 4.10.3. Here
we note only that a relative clause is a complex modifier and thus precedes
its head, as in(112) [loreak eman dizkiodan] neska
      flowers give AUX.COMP girl
      'the girl [I gave the flowers to]'
3.1.4.4. ParticiplesIn eastern varieties (only), there exists a fourth type of complex modifier.
This consists of the perfective participle of a verb (transitive or intransitive),
often accompanied by arguments and adjuncts, but with no further suffix on
the participle. Apart from the absence of any suffixes on the participle, this
construction is similar to the type of -ko phrase discussed in section 3.1.4.2
(i), and it is an alternative to the postposed eastern construction described in
section 3.1.3.5. Example:(113) nik erosi       liburua
      I   buy         book
       'the book I bought/the book bought by me'
3.1.5. Noun phrases lacking head nouns
There is no requirement that an NP must contain a head noun, and NPs with
empty heads are exceedingly common. Examples:
Table 52. Genitives
 gorri-a-k             'the red ones'
 nere-a                'mine'
 Bilbo-ko-a-k          'the ones in Bilbao' (often 'the people in Bilbao')
 bi berri              'two new ones'
 gu-re-kila-ko-a-k     'the ones (who are/were) with us'
Note in particular that a complex modifier, such as a genitive or a -ko
phrase, may modify such a headless noun phrase; for example, from
mendietan 'in the mountains' we can form the -ko phrase mendietako, which
150   Morphology
can take a null head and the article to produce mendietakoa 'the one in the
mountains'. This process is recursive, and the last noun phrase can take a
genitive suffix to form the genitive mendietakoaren, which can again take a
null head and an article to yield mendietakoarena 'the one belonging to the
one in the mountains', which can take (say) a dative case-suffix to give
mendietakoarenari 'to the one belonging to the one in the mountains'. Such
recursive formations with multiple null heads are perfectly normal in con-
text, but they have been misunderstood by some Basque grammarians, who
have tried to analyze them as single nouns with multiple case-suffixes and
who have consequently applied the label 'superdeclension' to such forma-
tions. The superdeclension analysis is quite wrong.
    The only inflectional suffix that can be recursively repeated is the geni-
tive: gizonarena 'the one of the man', gizonarenarena 'the one of the one of
the man', etxekoarena 'the one of the house', etxekoarenarena 'the one of
the one of the house'. In particular, -ko does not allow this type of recursiv-
ity: *etxekokoa.
    The animacy of a headless NP is determined by the animacy of its under-
stood head. For example, beltza 'the black one' takes animate morphology
when denoting a horse but inanimate morphology when denoting a skirt.","[174, 175, 176, 177, 178, 179, 180]"
"
4.11.5. Nonconstituent coordinationCoordination has often been used as a test to determine constituenthood.
Nevertheless, it has long been noted that the results of this test sometimes
seem contradictory. For instance, consider examples (2275) and (2276):(2275)   [Joxeren    liburu] eta    [Mirenen      aldizkari]   berriak
         Joxe.GEN    book     and   Miren.GEN     magazine     new.DET.PL
         'Joxe's (new) books and Miren's new magazines'(2276) Joxeren       [liburu berri] eta      [aldizkari   zaharr]ak
         Joxe.GEN    book     new     and    magazine     old.DET.PL
         'Joxe's new books and old magazines'In the first example the coordination test would produce the result that the
prenominal modifier and the noun form a constituent (which is not the
case), while in the second the noun and the adjective would be grouped to-
gether. Some devices have been proposed to overcome these problems (de-
letion, empty categories..).. Moreover, we find sometimes examples where
the elements grouped by coordination can hardly be considered constituents.
For example, in (2277), in one of its interpretations, we could advance an
analysis where the noun, the adjective and the article are grouped in one
constituent:(2277) Joxeren       [liburu zaharrak]      eta   [aldizkari berriak]
         Joxe.GEN   book      old.DET.PL    and   magazine     new.DET.PL
         'Joxe's old books and new magazines'But if we follow this line of argumentation, in an example like (2278) the
prenominal modifier would be outside of the constituent formed by the
noun, the article and the case marker:
888   Syntax
(2278) Herriko  [elbarriei]   eta                  [zaharrei]     gabon

         'They have given Christmas gifts to the disabled and elderly of the
         town.'","[917, 918]"
"
2.1.3. Syllable structure and phonotactic restrictions2.1.3.1. OnsetsThe only onset groups allowed in Basque are those of the muta-cum-liquida
type (including fl-, fr- and excluding dl-, tl-). Even these groups were not
permitted in older stages of the language and borrowings from Latin and
early Romance show either deletion of the stop or vowel epenthesis between
stop and liquid (see section 2.1.8.2). Words with these sequences in the
modern language are more recent borrowings (pobre 'poor', prakak 'pants',
plater 'plat€,fresko 'cool', triste 'sad', krabelin 'carnation', gris 'gray'), in
addition to a few cases of syncope in the native vocabulary (e.g. andere >
andre 'woman').",[63]
"   In some cases, this type of agreement gives rise to morphologically aber-
rant forms. See the following example, where a genitive NP corresponding
to an object has been relativized (see 3.5.5.1.2):(1893) Ez       nituen   aurkitu     [bila          nenbiltzan]
          not   AUX      find        searching      lA.SG.walk.PL.PST.C0MP
          argitasunak.
          explanations
         Ί didn't find the explanations I was looking for.' [adapted from
         Mitx. EIG VI: 166]The verb in (1893) is bila ibili 'look for', a complex expression where ibili
'walk, be active in' is inflected. With bila ibili, the subject NP takes the ab-
solutive case, and the object the genitive case (see above [4.10.3.1.4.3]).
The verb in (1893) is morphologically aberrant: on the one hand, it bears
agreement with the absolutive subject (first person singular), on the other, it
carries the plural agreement marker as if the subject were plural. Indeed,
number agreement is only linked to absolutive case marking in Basque, and
                                                                  Subordination   785
the verb in the relative clause should only agree with its subject. But this is
not the case in (1893), because in fact the plural marking within the verb
(-tza-) corresponds to agreement with the relativized NP (something irregu-
lar, since genitive NPs don't have verb agreement). The regular form for
(1893) would be (1894):(1894) Ez       nituen   aurkitu    bila        nenbilen
          not   AUX      find       searching       lA.walk.PST.coMP
          argitasunak.
          explanations
         Ί didn't find the explanations I was looking for.'","[814, 815]"
"Note, however, the following unusual case.(149) [ni eta ni bezalako asko]ren iritziz
      I    and I like.REL many.GEN opinion.iNSTR
      'in the opinion of me and of many like me'Here the genitive ending -en occurs only once, on the larger NP formed from
ni Τ and ni bezalako asko 'many like me'.
   Naturally, only the first pattern is possible in the rare cases in which the
conjoined NPs bear different case-suffixes:(150) Bost umerekin eta oinez         etorri zen Bilbotik.
      five child.COM and foot.lNSTR come AUX Bilbao.ABL
      'She came from Bilbao with five children and on foot.'
170   Morphology
Here the conjunction of comitative host umerekin 'with five children' and
instrumental oinez 'on foot' can be expressed in no other way.
   On the other hand, only the second pattern is possible when the coordi-
nate NP contains an adjective modifying both conjuncts:(151) [emazte ta ume] onakaz
      wife     and child good.COM
      'with the good women and children'Here on 'good' modifies both emazte 'woman' and ume 'child'. The form
emazteakaz eta ume onakaz is possible, but means 'with the women and
(with) the good children'.","[199, 200]"
"
3.1.2.2.3. The indefinite articleThe so-called indefinite article is bat. In general, this is identical to the nu-
meral bat 'one': etxe bat 'one house' or 'a house', though a few varieties
may make an accentual distinction. This article is used much less freely than
the indefinite articles of English and other western European languages, and
it often corresponds more directly to 'a certain', rather than merely to 'a(n)'.
Note the difference, for some speakers though not for all, between Semea
(ba-)dutfdaukat Ί have a son' (i.e., I am not without sons) and Seme bat
(ba-)dutfdaukat Ί have a certain son' (among others) or Ί have one son'
(not two) . Likewise, Emaztea dut/daukat is Ί have a wife', while #Emazte
bat dut/daukat sounds bizarre and suggests polygamy.
    The quantifier batzuk 'some, several', treated in section 3.1.2.6, is for-
mally a plural of this bat.
    Among some younger speakers, there is a tendency to extend the use of
bat to caique the much broader use of the Spanish article un(a).
    The indefinite article bat has a special use, as follows. It can follow a
bare noun carrying the genitive suffix -en, as in umeren bat 'a child', 'some
child or other'. This construction can be extended to involve two instances
of bat, as in liburu baten bat 'a book', 'some book or other'.
    The same construction with a numeral gives the sense of 'about, ap-
proximately', as in hogeiren bat 'about twenty', 'twenty or so'. Some
speakers drop the genitive and say hogei bat.

3.1.2.3. Demonstratives3.1.2.3.1. Ordinary demonstrativesThere are three demonstratives: proximal (h)au(r) 'this', mesial (h)ori 'that'
(just there), distal (h)ura (B a) 'that' (over yonder). In general, the first indi-
cates proximity to the speaker, the second proximity to the addressee, and
the third remoteness from both, though on occasion hori and hura merely
indicate differing degrees of remoteness from the speaker. All show stem-
suppletion: proximal hau(r) has oblique singular stem hon-, plural stem
haue- (Β one-)', mesial hori has oblique singular stem horr-, plural stem
horie-·, distal hura has oblique singular stem har-, plural stem haie-. All
three occupy the DET2 position: etxe hau(r) 'this house', ume horiek 'those
children', mendi hura 'that mountain'.
   In B, uniquely, the demonstratives may occur either preposed or in both
positions simultaneously, and Β has constructions like ori gizona or ori
gizon ori (often written as ori gizonori) 'that man (just there)' and a gizon a
(or a gizona) 'that man (over yonder)'. These take double case-marking, as
in orrek gizon orrek (ergative) and oneri umeori 'to this child' (dative), a
rare exception to the principle that case-marking occurs only once within an
NP. None of this is possible in other varieties.
   See section 3.1.6.1.1 for the use of demonstratives as personal pronouns.
   The determiner hori is used for something which is not located in space,
or not located in a way that is relevant to the context, as in Nor da Igone
hori? 'Who is this Igone (you're talking about)?' It is possible to use hori
and hau, Spanish-style, to express 'the former' and 'the latter', respectively,
though other locutions are more common.","[152, 153]"
"Nominal inflection
Case endings are glossed with the name of the case, without trying to ana-
lyze them further into determiner, number and case ending proper. This in-
formation is easily retrievable from the inflection charts offered in chapter
3.2. For reading ease, the gloss for a case is often not the morphological
case label, but its meaning ('with' for coM(itative), etc.). Among grammati-
cal cases, dative is glossed in exactly the same way (DAT or 'to'), and erga-
tive always with the case label (ERG). The zero case, absolutive, is treated
somewhat differently. We have taken it as the default case, so that, unless
otherwise stated, the absence of any case indication on a nominal means it is
in the absolutive case.
   Determiners and plural markers are not easily isolatable for most case
endings and we have not tried to identify them in the glosses. Thus,
gizonekin comitative plural is glossed as 'men.with', or 'men.COM', while
the comitative singular gizonarekin is glossed as 'man.with' or 'man.COM'.
The determiner (-a) and the plural marker (-it) are most easily identifiable in
the absolutive case, but here too, we have only identified them where di-
viii Notes on glosses
rectly relevant. Thus, a noun like etxeak '(the) houses' has been glossed in
full (house.DET.PL) only where the information is important. Otherwise it is
glossed as 'houses'. Similarly, singular etxea is usually glossed as 'house'
and only where needed as 'house.DET'. Nonetheless, both determiner and
plural are identified when they are attached to anything other than a noun
(to adjectives, headless relatives, etc.): etxe handia is always glossed as
'house big.DET\ etxekoak 'house.REL.DET.PL', etc. The Basque texts in sec-
tion 5 have been glossed with more details. There all case endings have
been separated from the stem and identified, and the latter has always been
glossed in the singular. The case endings thus identified can be easily
checked in the tables provided in section 3.2. As usual, determiners and plu-
ral markers have only been identified for the zero case, the absolutive.","[7, 8]"
"Many of these examples are ambiguous. For example, in (2206) it may be
the case that we are calling two people, one that is in charge of the econ-
omy, and the other being in charge of finances; but it could also be the case
that we refer to people that are at the same time in charge of the economy
and finances.
   Thus, the possibility of coordination is wider in word compounding than
in the case of derivation; but this possibility is not unconstrained. We will
try to analyze the conditions that favor this kind of construction or make it
more difficult.
   This type of coordination is not allowed in co-compounds:(2208)   arroz    eta   kafesnea
         rice     and   coffee.milk.DET
         'rice and coffee with milk'/*'rice with milk and coffee with milk'The same happens when morphophonological changes have taken place
(arto to the derivational form arta-):(2209)   *arbi    eta  arta.soro
         turnip   and corn.fieldA high degree of lexicalization makes it difficult to coordinate two elements
under one only 'head':(2210)   lardi    eta   behi-esnea
         sheep    and   cow-milk.DET
                                                               Coordination   871
The lack of parallelism in the relations of each conjunct with the head pro-
hibits their coordination:(2211)   *mando eta mendi.bide
         mule      and mountain.trail
         'mule- and mountain trails'Mandobide would be a mule trail, and mendibide a mountain trail. The two
modifier nouns cannot be coordinated with the head noun.
  On the other hand, coordination is easier with synthetic compounds:(2212)   barazki      eta gozoki saltzaileak
         vegetables and candy seller.DET.PL
         'vegetable and candy sellers'Coordination is also possible when the head is semantically 'open' and im-
poses very few requirements on its complement, allowing for a large variety
of them:(2213)   uso    eta antzar sailak
         dove and goose group.DET.PL
         'flocks of doves and geese'In this line, compounds with a very low degree of lexicalization and a high
regularity and productivity are accepted and used without any problem:(2214)   ekonomia eta hizkuntza arazoak
         economy and language problem.DET.PL
         'language and economy problems'A last case that could be taken into account is the possibility of coordinating
parts of complex words with prenominal modifiers. These constructions are
totally ruled out in Basque:(2215)   *azukrearen   eta gatz-ontzia
         sugar.DET.GEN and salt-pot.DET(2216)   *ekonomiaren         eta    hizkuntza-arazoak
         economy.det.GEN      and   language-problem.DET.PL
872 Syntax
4.11.4. Sentence coordination and ellipsisIn the same way as smaller elements, whole sentences may also be con-
juncts in coordinated structures. If the two clauses have some like material,
the repeated elements are often omitted. When this happens, it is not always
clear to which category the coordinated constituents belong. In this section
we will try to analyze mainly two structures where the constituents involved
seem to be sentences: gapping structures, and examples with ellipsis of the
auxiliary verb.","[900, 901, 902]"

4.10.3.4.1. Appositive relative clauses constructed with relative pronounsRelative clauses constructed with relative pronouns occur in the written tra-
dition of all dialects since the beginning of Basque literature in the 16th cen-
tury. They did not really penetrate everyday spoken Basque, but they were
widely used in written texts, not only in books, but also in less formal regis-
ters; they were employed, for instance, in sermons and correspondence. At
the end of the 19th century, language consciousness led many to reject ele-
ments of the language taken from Romance languages, especially those that
were not essential and not fully integrated into the popular language. This
attitude was general. It was found among writers of western Basque dialects
who were under the strong influence of linguistic purism, but it also oc-
curred among easterners, who, though usually opposed to the form of pur-
ism promoted on the other side of the border, tried to keep written Basque
based on the spoken language as far as possible. Most of the grammarians
during the first two thirds of the 20th century considered these relatives as
not genuine and Lafitte (1944) did not pay much attention to them, consid-
ering they were mere gibberish. Nowadays there is no such condemnation
against these relatives, and no grammarian would consider that they do not
belong in the language. Nevertheless, it should be said that their use is more
or less marginal, and far from being as wide as it was until around 1880.
   The most salient characteristics of these relative clauses are illustrated in
(1957). They follow the antecedent and are appositive or extraposed rela-
810 Syntax
tives. They contain a relative pronoun built on the wh-word zein 'which'
(non 'where' in local cases); this pronoun receives the case ending that cor-
responds to it within the relative, and zein can receive the definite article as
well. The verb within the relative receives either -(e)n or bait- as a comple-
mentizer:(1957) Hiltzen       ditu    belar gaixtoak,        [zeinek
         kill.IMPF   AUX     grass     bad.DET.PL   which.PL.ERG
         iresten            baitute     lurrak      ogiari

          eman behar lukeen               gozoa].
          give need AUX.POT.COMP nourishment
        'It kills the weeds, which swallow the nourishment that the earth
        should give to the wheat.' [Duv. L.L.:72]In (1957) the relative clause is bracketed. The antecedent is belar gaixto
'weed' which carries the plural absolutive suffix (-ak). The relative clause
follows the antecedent. Its first constituent is the relative pronoun zein
'which', with the plural ergative suffix (-ek). The inflected verb form within
the relative receives the prefix bait- as complementizer (baitute).","[839, 840]"

                VERB ...      [.... ...

                                        NON-FINITEIn (a), the wh-word is an argument of the verb in the main clause and it re-
ceives its case from it. In (b), on the other hand, the wh-word is an argument
of the verb within the non-finite clause. The latter (taken as a whole) is the
direct object or the subject (absolutive) of the main clause. The first con-
struction (a) is highly marked. It is found in old texts and it usually requires
822 Syntax
the wh-word to correspond to arguments having the same case ending in
both sentences, as in (1985). However, when this is not the case, the wh-
word shows the case ending given by the verb in the main clause (not the
one it would receive from the verb in the subordinate clause). One such ex-
ample appears in Etxepare's 1545 poems:(1988) Kondu        hertsi    behar dugu harzaz               eman
          account   careful   need     AUX     that.lNSTR     give
          segurki   [nori      baitu         bere    odolaz
          surely    who.DAT    bait.AUX      his     blood.lNSTR
          kario erosi].
          dear buy
         'Surely, we must give a careful account [for our soul] to the one
         who redeemed it with his blood at such a high price.' [Etx:109-110]In (1988) the dative wh-word (nori) is the indirect object within the main
clause. If the case corresponded to its role in the subordinate clause, it
would have been ergative.
   Unlike the first construction (1987a), the second construction (1987b)
with a non finite verb within the subordinate clause is found in all dialects
of present-day Basque. It is used especially with verbs like *edun or eduki
'have', and izan, egon 'be' when they express existence and possession, re-
spectively. The wh-word within the subordinate clause can receive any case.
Crucially, it can be subject and receive the ergative case; therefore, the con-
struction must be distinguished from control structures found in other con-
texts. Consider the following example (Bizkaian dialect, 20th century):(1989)    [Nok       eman] baleukie          orrek      jango        leukie
          who.ERG    give     if.had.POT     they.ERG   eat.FUT AUX.POT
         'If they had somebody to give it to them, they would eat it.' [Kir.
         Egun: 39]In (1989) the wh-word within the non finite clause is ergative. In eastern
dialects, the non finite verb appears in the radical form. This is the case in
(1986) where the verb is pausa 'lay', radical of the past participle pausatu.
In western dialects, the participial is used, and it is often nominalized taking
the definite article or the partitive. For instance, Matthew 8,20 is expressed
in a Gipuzkoan version as in (1990) where the participle takes the partitive:
                                                                     Subordination 823
(1990)    Gizonaren    Semeak,   ordean,       ez      du     [burua

          non     ezarririk].
          where   put.PRTT
         'But the Son of man has nowhere to lay his head.' [Orix. Mat 8,20]In older texts the subordinate clauses appear with finite forms. These were
subjunctive forms as shown in (1991) below:(1991)    Gizonaren    semeak    ez    dik                  non      bere
          man.GEN      son.ERG   not   has(ALLOC)           where    his
          burua       reposa     dezan.
          head.DET    put(RAD)   AUX(SUBJ).COMP
         'But the son of man has nowhere to lay his head.' [Leiz. Mat 8,20]Example (1991) is taken from the translation of the gospels by Leizarraga
(16th century) and it must be compared here with (1986) and (1990). In
(1991) the subordinate clause is finite, and the inflected verb form is the
auxiliary *ezan in subjunctive form (dezan). Such forms are not used in pre-
sent day Basque and look quite archaic. However, they were still used in the
18th century by writers such as Larramendi and Mogel in western dialects:(1992)   Ez dago [nok          egin          dagijan
         not is        who.ERG make          AUX(SUBJ).COMP
         penitenzijarik].
         penance.PRTT
         'There is nobody to do penance.' [Mog. Konf.:29]The example is extracted from a Bizkaian text by Mogel (1803). In this dia-
lect, the transitive auxiliary for subjunctive forms is egin (dagijan) instead
of *ezan (dezan).","[851, 852, 853]"
"
4.10.3.1.1.3. Gapping of the relativized NPAs can be seen in the examples above, the relativized NP is gapped in ordi-
nary relatives, and neither a relative pronoun, nor any other pronominal
form corresponding directly to the relativized NP appears within the relative
clause.
   However, when the relativized NP is one of the NPs carrying verb-
agreement (absolutive, ergative, dative), the agreement marker acts like a
kind of remote or indirect resumptive morpheme (see Bossong 1984). Com-
pare the following examples:
                                                              Subordination   765
(1850) a.  merkatuan     erosi dituzun        sagarrak
           market.LOC buy AUX.COMP apple.DET.PL
           'the apples that you bought in the market.'
        b. sagarrak        erosi dituzun       merkatua
           apple.DET.PL buy       AUX.COMP market.DET
           'the market where you bought the apples'In (1850a) the relativized NP is the direct object of the relative clause. It
triggers verb-agreement, and the inflected auxiliary has a morpheme (-it-)
indicating that the object is plural. Thus, although the relativized NP is not
overt within the relative clause, the plural marker within the verb inflection
shows agreement with it.
    On the contrary, in (1850b), the relativized NP is an adverbial NP (loca-
tive) and the verb doesn't agree with it. As can be seen, in this case the rela-
tive NP has no overt realization within the relative clause, neither direct
(pronoun) nor indirect (agreement).
    Observe that the gap within the relative clause stands not only for the re-
lativized NP, but for the whole phrase, including the case-marker. This is
true of all cases. For example in (1850a) the relativized NP corresponds to a
grammatical case (absolutive), and in (1850b) to an adverbial case (loca-
tive).","[794, 795]"
"
4.10.2.2.1. Adjunct structures based on the verbal nounThe verbal noun, formed with the suffix -t(z)e, may practically take any of
the inflectional suffixes that regular noun phrases take. We already dis-
cussed the use of absolutive dative or ergative nominalized clauses, in the
section of complement structures. We also included there nominalized
clauses with the allative case-ending (-ra) and regarded them as comple-
ment clauses:(1760)    Ogia      erostera          noa.
          bread     buy.NOM.ALL       go
          'I'm going to buy bread.'",[767]
"   Note, however, that it is never possible to place a determiner on each
conjunct but a case-ending only on the last: *itsasoa eta mendietan 'in the
sea and the mountains'. In many instances, both patterns are equally accept-
able:(145) a. [Pantxikari eta Mireni]      eman dizkiet liburuak.
         PantDAT      and Miren.DAT give AUX books
         Ί gave the books to Pantxika and (to) Miren.'
                                                           The noun phrase   169
      b. [Pantxika eta Miren]i         eman dizkiet liburuak.
         Pantxika and Miren.DAT   Sometimes, however, only the first pattern is possible. This is generally
the case when pronouns and/or demonstratives are conjoined:(146) a. zuri       eta niri
         you.DAT and I.DAT
         'to you and to me'
      b. *[zu eta ni]ri(147) a. hauek eta horiek
         'these and those'
      b. *[hau eta hori]ekIn these examples, the dative case-ending -(r)i and the plural ending -ek ab-
solutely must be repeated.
   The same applies when the demonstratives accompany nouns:(148) a. Gizoti honek    eta emakume harek        egin dute.
         man    this.ERG and woman       that.ERG do   AUX
         'This man and that woman did it.'
      b. *[Gizon hau eta emakume har]ek egin dute.","[198, 199]"
"
4.10.2.2.2.3. Other adverbial structures based on the participleThe participle is also used with other independent words to form adjunct
clauses; these postpositions may take noun phrases as their complement
(e.g. ezik 'except for (not)', ezean 'except for (not)', gäbe 'without', on-
dorenlondoanlosteon 'after', bitartean 'in the meantime', arte 'until'), and,
in some cases, also take -en headed finite clauses, as we saw in section
4.10.2.1.2.4. Even though the same structure that exists for the participle
also exists for regular noun phrases, it is harder to argue that the perfect par-
ticiple is indeed part of a nominalized structure; the article, for example, is
missing and, in the cases where a regular noun phrase requires genitive
case, the participle lacks it. Below we provide some relevant examples.
    The words ezik and ezean, both based on ez 'not' form negative condi-
tionals:(1799) a.    Jonek       ezik,     beste     guztiok            izena   eman
             Jon.ERG     ezik      other     all.PROX.PL        name    give

4.10.3.1.5. Accessibility4.10.3.1.5.1. Accessibility hierarchyWhen a noun phrase can be relativized in a clause, it is said to be accessible
to relative-clause formation. Most of the time, accessibility to relativization
is understood according to the morphosyntactic features of the relativized
NP, and this is the way we take it here.
    Basque is an SOV language which uses a gapping strategy for the relativ-
ized phrase. Such languages typically have constraints on accessibility, and
so we expect to find constraints in Basque. It is easy to understand how rela-
tivization may appear rather difficult in these circumstances, since the rela-
tivized phrase, which includes the case-ending, has no overt realization
within the relative clause. Notice, however, that in those cases where the re-
lativized NP agrees with the verb, verb-agreement can be considered as a
kind of resumptive realization of the relativized phrase. Such a situation can
appear in Basque with ergative, absolutive and dative phrases.
    It is generally admitted that accessibility displays the following syntactic
hierarchy (cf. Keenan & Comrie [1977, 1979]:(1863) subject > direct object > indirect object > adverbialThis hierarchy is the one which is found in Basque, as we will presently
show.
   First, let us see how the syntactic hierarchy shown in (1863) could be ex-

The hierarchy of (1863) is modified in (1864) because a) no superiority re-
garding accessibility seems to appear in Basque between subjects and ob-
jects, b) subcategorized adverbial phrases are easier to relativize than ad-
junctive adverbial cases. The interpretation of (1864) is as follows:- Ergative and absolutive NPs can always be relativized without any kind of
restriction, and no hierarchy seems to exist between them in inflected rela-
tives.","[804, 805]"

3.1.2.6. QuantifiersQuantifiers vary in their placement. Some appear in the DETL position, oth-
ers in the DET2 position. In the first group are zenbat 'how many?' 'how
much?' and hainbat and hainbeste 'so many, so much, that many, that
much'. In the second group are batzu(k) 'several, some', guti ~ gutti ~ gutxi
'few, little, not much, not many', gehiago 'more' and gehiegi 'too much'.
Many others are regionally variable, being in some places preposed but in
others postposed. Among these are (h)anitz 'much, many, lots o f , zenbait
'several, some', aski 'enough' and asko 'many, much, lots o f : asko diru or
diru asko 'lots of money'. (This asko formerly meant 'enough' in the east.)
   Naturally, the presence of a quantifier normally prohibits any other de-
terminer from appearing (though see section 3.1.2.9 for two major excep-
tions). Consequently, an NP with a quantifier is not usually overtly marked
for number. Examples:Table 45. NP with quantifier
  hanitz jende                           'lots of people'
 zenbait ume                             'several children'
 jende gutxi                             'few people'
 diru gehiago                            'more money'However, the addition of the article is by no means rare here, and we find
examples like merezi hainitzak 'many virtues' in the writer Haramburu, for
expected merezi hainitz (here hainitz is a variant of hanitz), and we hear urte
askoan 'in many years', with the article, for expected indefinite urte as-
kotan. Some speakers regard this odd use as being in some way ""expres-
sive"". In eastern varieties, anitz can take a plural article to form the pronoun
anitzak 'lots of people'.
    The quantifier oro 'all', today confined to eastern dialects, exhibits
unique behavior: it functions as a kind of appositive, following a complete
NP with a determiner. Compare mendiak '(the) mountains' with mendiak oro
'all the mountains'. If the NP is case-marked, the case-marker may be re-
peated on oro, and so the ergative case-form of this last example is mendiek
132   Morphology
orok, with ergative -k appearing twice (note the absence of the article; the
form *mendiek oroek is impossible). Likewise, 'on all the mountains' is
mendietan orotan, with repetition of the locative case-ending, though mendi
orotan also occurs and is now perhaps the norm with non-argument (adver-
bial) cases. The same behavior is sometimes exhibited by the adjective
guz(t)i 'all', and so, in place of normal mendi guztiak 'all the mountains',
we occasionally find mendiak guztiak. This is usual when a demonstrative is
present: mendi horietan guztietan 'on all those mountains'.
    In fact, the behavior of quantifiers is often regionally highly variable and
idiosyncratic. For example, with franko 'a whole bunch of', we find in use
all offranko gizon, gizon franko, gizona franko and gizonak franko.
    Certain words with quantifier-like meanings are strictly adjectives, in-
cluding guzti ~ guzi 'all', bakoitz 'each', gehien 'most' and ugari 'abundant,
numerous': etxe guztiak 'all the houses', ikasle bakoitza 'each student',pilo-
tari gehienak 'most jai-alai players', janari ugaria 'abundant food'. But ge-
hiago 'more' and gehiegi 'too much, too many' are determiners, and they do
not co-occur with another determiner: lan gehiago 'more work', diru ge-
hiegi 'too much money'.","[161, 162]"

4.10.3. Relatives
        B. Oyhar^abalDifferent relativization strategies are used in Basque. The main distinction
is the one separating ordinary embedded relatives from appositive and ex-
traposed relatives with relative pronouns. This second kind of relativization
is a marked one, and has often been considered as not genuine by modern
grammarians like Altube, Lafitte and Lafon. Although most Basque writers
in the 20th century haven't used adjoined relatives with relative pronouns,
these were very common in written texts until the second half of the 19th
century in all dialects. Here are examples of both kinds of relatives:(1846) Hala     dio     eskuizkribuari   josita        zetorren
         so     says    manuscript.DAT   attach.PTCP   came.COMP
        ohartxo       horrek.
        note, DIM that. ERG
       'So says this little note which came attached to the manuscript.'
       [Am: 12]In (1846), the relative clause precedes the modified noun, and it is embed-
ded within the whole phrase. This clause contains no relative pronoun, and
                                                                 Subordination 763
no resumptive pronoun, and the relativized noun has no overt realization in
it. Consider now (1847):(1847) Ikusten        ditut(...)   bi    zizpa-kanoiren   muturrak,
          see.LMPF    AUX.         two   gun.GEN          ends
          zeinek(...)  ez baininduten guti izitu.
          which.ERG not bait.AUX          little frighten
         Ί see ...two gun barrels, which scared me more than a little.' [Eliss.
         P.A.:67]In (1847), the relative clause is said to be adjoined, because it is outside of
the noun phrase whose head the relative modifies {muturrak). This relative
contains a relative pronoun carrying a case ending (zeinek, ergative plural).
   Besides the two types mentioned above, correlative relatives and ad-
joined relatives with resumptive pronouns are also employed, mainly in
eastern dialects. These will be presented at the end of the section
(4.10.3.4.3-4).","[792, 793]"
"
3.8.7. Other types of compoundsIn this subsection, we gather several small compounding patterns not con-
sidered above. The adjective berri is suffixed to the perfective participle
form of the verb, or in the case of some lexicalized forms, to the verb root,
to give rise to adjectives/nouns with the meaning 'just V-ed'; e.g.: sortu-
berri 'just born', ezkonberri 'just married, newly wed', hilberri 'having re-
cently died', etorriberri 'newcomer'.
   The postposition gäbe 'without' appears in a number of lexicalized for-
mations; e.g.: nahigabe 'displeasure' (nahi 'want'), paregabe 'peerless',
bidegabe 'injustice' (bide 'way'), ezkongabe 'unmarried', lotsagabe
'shameless'. In some of these compounds, the initial velar is irregularly de-
voiced; e.g.: ustekabe 'accident' (uste 'opinion, idea'), atsekabe 'disfortune'
(atsegin 'pleasure'), dohakabe 'unfortunate' (doha[tu] 'provide').
   The adjective erdi 'half can be prefixed to adjectives and verbs and
sometimes to other parts of speech; e.g.: erdi-itsu 'half blind', erdi-lotan
'half asleep', erdi-hil 'half dead', erdi-galduta 'haft lost', erdi-entzun 'half
hear', erdipurdi 'badly' (lit. 'in a half-assed way').
360 Morphology
3.8.8. Morphological    reduplicationsAdjectives can be repeated for emphasis. The first repeated adjective is left
uninflected. This is a productive procedure (examples are given with the
singular determiner):argi-argia 'very clear'
zuri-zuria 'very white'
bete-betea 'completely full'
berdin-berdina 'completely identical'
bilbotar-bilbotarra 'very Bilbaoan'
oinarri-oinarrizkoa 'very basic' (oinarri 'base' = oin 'foot' + harri 'stone')
(ioinarrizko-oinarrizkoa)
ber-bera 'the very same'   This type of reduplication is also used with certain adverbial expressions,
but with less productivity:poliki-poliki 'very slowly'
emeki-emeki 'very softly and carefully'
ixil-ixilik 'quietly'
zabal-zabalik 'wide open'
geldi-geldirik 'very slowly'
astero-astero 'every week'
aurre-aurrean 'exactly in front'
itsu-itsuan 'blindly' (blind-blind.DET.LOC)
zuzen-zuzenean 'directly'
bat-batean (bapatean) 'suddenly' (one-one.DET.LOC)
hasiera-hasieratik 'from the very beginning'
bihotz-bihotzez 'sincerely' (heart-heart-lNSTR)   In a few fixed expressions with a distributive meaning the inflection is
repeated:aldian-aldian 'each at its time'
banan-banan 'one by one'   There is another repetitive construction, perhaps best treated as syntactic
rather than morphological, in which an inflected word, generally occurring
                                                                Compounds 361
in the instrumental indefinite (-z) or the partitive (-rik), is followed by an
uninflected copy of the same word:hitzez hitz 'word by word, literally'
herriz herri 'from town to town'
etxez etxe 'from house to house'
etxerik etxe 'from house to house'
menderik mende 'century after century'
kasuan kasu 'each case separately'
tokian toki 'each place separately'    These expressions can take the relational suffix -ko, e.g.: tokian tokiko
hizkerak 'local dialects'.
    There are several patterns of sound-symbolic reduplications. In one such
pattern, the stem is repeated replacing the first consonant by m- in the redu-
plicant (or adding initial m- to stems starting by a vowel):
zehatz-mehatz 'very precisely' (zehatz 'exact')
duda-muda 'doubt, incertitude' (duda 'doubt')
zoro-moro 'a little crazy' (zoro 'crazy')
esamesa 'rumor' (esan 'say')
isilka-misilka 'silently' (isil 'silent, quiet')
ikusi-makusi Ί spy with my little eye' (ikus[i] 'see')
hazur-mazurrak 'remains of a meal' (B hazur 'bone')
kako-makoak 'schemes' (kako 'hook; key')
nahas-mahas 'confusion, mess' (nahas[i] 'mix')
inguru-minguruka 'in a roundabout way' (inguru 'surroundings')
auzi-mauzika 'disputing' (auzi 'dispute')  In a number of these reduplicative compounds the unduplicated stem
does not have independent existence in the language:aiko-maiko 'indecisive'
zarra-marra 'rubbish'
ziri-miri 'drizzle'
zurru-murru 'rumble'    Occasionally we find a consonant other than m- or an entirely different
initial syllable in the reduplicant; e.g.: txitean-pitean 'constanly', nahaste-
borraste 'mess' (nahas[i] 'mix, to mess up').
362   Morphology
   In another type of sound-symbolic formation, there is a vowel alterna-
tion, generally with i in the first component and a in the second, although
other patterns are also found in a few examples:fristi-frasta 'any which way'
 zipirri-zaparra 'clumsily'
 ziri-zara 'restlessness'
 zirt edo zart 'decisively'
 kirriz-karraz 'noise of shoes in walking'
 tiki-taka 'walking step by step'
dinbi-danba 'hitting with blows'
zirti-zarta 'helter-skelter'
kili-kolo 'insecure'    In addition, there are onomatopoetic formations where the same element
is repeated twice without any changes; e.g.: pil-pil 'boiling softly' (pilpilean
'hot, current'), marmar 'whispering', mara-mara 'falling softly (generally
said of snow or rain)', parra-parra 'profusely', dardar 'trembling'. A few
nouns and verbs clearly have their origin in such onomatopoetic reduplica-
tive formations: e.g.: marmara 'whisper', dardara 'vibration', dirdira
'shine, glitter', dirdira(tu) 'shine'. It is likely that the word gogor 'hard' is a
reduplication of gor 'deaf' (for the meaning, cf. Sp duro de oido 'hard of
hearing').

                                  Syntax
4.1. Valency and argument structure in the Basque verb
     R. Etxepare4.1.1. Valency and the auxiliary system: an outline Leaving aside a small set of verbs (see 3.5.3), Basque finite verbs are com-
 posed of a morphologically independent lexical verb carrying aspectual in-
 formation, and a clitic auxiliary bearing Tense, Agreement and Modal af-
 fixes. The choice of auxiliaries in Basque seems to be largely dependent on
 the valency of the predicate. Intransitive, transitive, and ditransitive auxilia-
ries typically correspond to monovalent, bivalent and trivalent predicates.
The arguments of the verb (participants in the event, such as agents, themes
or patients, and beneficiaries) are mapped systematically by person and
number morphology corresponding to grammatical functions such as sub-
ject, object and indirect object. Changes in the argument structure of the
verb (as in the causative/inchoative alternation) are also signaled in the
choice of the auxiliary. However, in some cases the correlation between
valency and choice of auxiliary does not obtain. The mismatch between
valency and morphology is due in these cases to the contribution of an as-
pectual dimension (see section 4.1.1.3).
    In order to maintain the two domains clear (lexical structure and mor-
phology), I will refer to the valency of the verb with categories such as
monovalent, bivalent or trivalent, and to its morphological expression with
categories such as intransitive and transitive. The latter are familiar from
the structural analysis of basic verbal paradigms (in section 3.5.3) and are
based on the presence/absence of ergative morphology. When ergative mor-
phology is present in the paradigm corresponding to a finite form, I will re-
fer to that form as transitive. Otherwise, I will refer to that form as intransi-
tive.
   In sentences with transitive verbs, the subject is morphologically marked
as ergative and the direct object in the absolutive case (zero suffix). As for
one argument-verbs, Basque expresses morphologically a distinction be-
tween tow types of monovalent predicates that has been noted syntactically
in other languages. This is the distinction between unaccusative and unerga-
364 Syntax
tive predicates (Perlmutter 1978; Burzio 1981). Subjects of unergative
predicates take the ergative case; subjects of unaccusative predicates, on the
other hand, take the absolutive case. In accord with case marking, unerga-
tive predicates take the transitive auxiliary, and unaccusative predicates the
intransitive one:(499) a. Jonek          ardoa            ekarri du.      (transitive)
             Jon.ERG    wine.DET.(ABS)   bring   AUX
          'Jon brought the wine.'
       b. Jonek      saltatu du.  (unergative)
           Jon.ERG jump      AUX
          'Jon jumped.'
       c. Jon         etorri da.  (unaccusative)
             Jon(ABS)   come    AUX
          'Jon came.'","[389, 390, 391, 392, 393, 394]"
"The dative argument can represent either a hidden possessor or a goal (a
true argument of the verb). In the first case, the verb is bivalent: the absolut-
ive constituent marks the theme and the dative marks the goal. In the second
case, the dative only marks a possessive-like relation with the absolutive.
Again, this is a case of 'ethical dative'.
   Verbs of inherently specified motion (such as igo 'climb', jaitsi 'go
down, descend' or igaro 'cross') give rise to two sorts of transitive struc-
                                               Valency and argument structu re 419
tures: on the one hand, transitive structures in which the object is a theme
(a); on the other, affected transitive structures in which the object is some
sort of measure (b):(666) a. Jonek       patata zakuak jaitsi        ditu.
           Jon.ERG   potato sacks     take.down AUX.TR
          'Jon took down the potato sacks.'
       b. Jonek      50 metro jaitsi        ditu     urpean.
           Jon.ERG 50 meters descend AUX.TR underwater
          'Jon descended 50 meters under water.'","[448, 449]"
"3.1.6.1.5. ReflexivesThere are no true reflexive pronouns; instead, reflexive noun phrases are
formed by combining the genitive of an intensive personal pronoun with
buru 'head' and the definite article -a. Here are the forms:Table 56. Reflexive noun phrases
 neure burua        'myself
 heure burua       'yourself (intimate)
 bere burua        'himself/herself
 geure burua       'ourselves'
 zeure burua       'yourself (unmarked)
 zeuen burua       'yourselves'
 zere(n) burua     'themselves'
Some speakers add plural -k to the plural reflexives (geure buruak 'our-
selves'); this was usual in the older language, but today it is less common
than the other form. Except when this -k is added, a reflexive is always for-
mally non-plural and never triggers plural agreement in the verb:(131) Ispiluan   ikusi dugu (*ditugu) geure      burua.
      mirror.LOC see AUX                our.lNTS head
      'We saw ourselves in the mirror.'",[189]
"
3.2.5. Personal pronounsThe genitive form of the personal pronouns has the ending -re, instead of
-en (with the exception of the second person plural pronoun zuek, which his-
torically is more recent, and has a genitive zueri). Other than this, personal
pronouns inflect in the same manner as indefinite noun phrases:Table 68. Personal pronouns
          ni Τ          hi 'thou'    gu 'we'      zu 'you'     zuek 'you-PL'

As with nouns, the affix gan of local cases may be attached directly to the
absolutive form (nigan ~ niregan, etc.).",[209]
"Instrumental. The instrumental case carries the endings indefinite -z, singu-
lar -az and plural -ez. In some dialects the plural is -etaz, instead. In High
Navarrese, the final consonant in the instrumental is -s: HN eskuas 'with the
hand' (standard eskuaz). The instrumental indicates instrument or means:
giltzaz ireki dugu atea 'we have opened the door with the key', trenez etorri
gara 'we have come by train', oinez 'by foot'; matter: zilarrez egin dugu
'we have made it with silver', zilarrezko eleztuna 'a silver ring'; and topic:
morfologiaz hitzegin genuen 'we spoke about morphology'. It is also used in
some simple time expressions: goizez 'early in the morning', garaiz 'on
time', egunaz zerbait alegratzen naiz, gabaz beti penetan 'during the day I
become somewhat happy, at night, always in pain' (folk song) and with
names of languages: euskaraz (egin) '(to speak) in Basque', ingelesez 'in
English'. In both of these usages, the instrumental is usually replaced by the
locative in more complex expressions: gaur goizean 'today in the morning',
hizkuntza honetan (egin) '(to speak) in this language'.
    As mentioned above, in Bizkaian and Gipuzkoan areas, the comitative is
used instead of the instrumental in its central meanings: giltzarekin ireki
dugu atea 'we have opened the door with the key', eskuekin egin dugu 'we
have made it with our hands', although residual use of the instrumental is
maintained in these dialects in other instances.
    Some verbs take complements in the instrumental: ahaztu naiz liburuaz
Ί have forgotten the book' (see section 4.1.7.1).
    The instrumental is also used in some idiomatic expressions: buruz ikasi
'to learn by heart (lit. by head)', etxez etxe 'from house to house' (see 3.8.6,
3.8.8). Some postpositions also require a complement in the instrumental:
mugaz bestalde 'on the other side of the border', horretaz gain 'in addition
to that', horretaz aparte 'aside from that' (see 3.3).",[214]
"
3.1.1.3. Sex-markingIn the great majority of cases, nouns are not marked for sex: ikasle 'student',
mediku 'doctor', poeta 'poet', antzerkilari 'actor', 'actress', mahaizain
                                                             The noun phrase   117
 'waiter', 'waitress', zerbitzari 'servant', joskile 'tailor, dressmaker, seam-
stress', katu 'cat', ardi 'sheep', zaldi 'horse', and many others are all neutral
as to sex.
   The sex-marking of nouns, where it occurs at all, is usually done lexi-
cally: gizon 'man', emakume 'woman'; zezen 'bull', behi 'cow'. A few cases
are asymmetric: alongside generic zaldi 'horse' and female behor 'mare',
there is no distinct lexical item for 'stallion'. With nouns denoting human
beings, the suffix -sa (borrowed from Romance) is occasionally used to
mark a word as female: jainko 'god\ jainkosa 'goddess'; okin 'baker', re-
gional okintsa 'female baker'. In much of the country, alargun means both
'widow' and 'widower', but in some places it is strictly 'widower', while
'widow' is alarguntsa. Eastern varieties make more systematic use of this
suffix, distinguishing, for example, between errient and errientsa 'primary-
school teacher' (male and female) and infermier and infermiertsa 'nurse'
(male and female). Names of larger animals can be sex-marked, when nec-
essary, by suffixing ar 'male' or erne 'female': katu 'cat', katar 'tomcat',
kateme 'female cat'. In one or two cases a diminutive suffix is used to mark
an animal name as female: urde 'hog', urdanda ~ urdanga 'sow', with di-
minutive -anda. (In the case of oilo 'hen', which is already sex-marked, the
diminutive oilanda means merely 'young hen'; the male form is oilar
'rooster'.)
   A certain number of sex-marked pairs have been borrowed or adapted
from Romance. Thus, 'first cousin' is lehengusu for a male cousin but le-
hengusina for a female cousin; here native lehen 'first' has been added to
the Romance words for 'cousin'. Similarly, 'male teacher' is maisu but 'fe-
male teacher' is maistra, both forms coming from Romance. Such borrowed
pairs are now numerous in western varieties.
   In western varieties, a few native nouns have somewhat remarkably ac-
quired Romance-style sex-marking. The purely native word gixajo 'poor fel-
low', whose final -o has nothing to do with the Romance gender-marker,
has for many speakers acquired a female counterpart gixaja, with importa-
tion of the Spanish feminine suffix. See also section 3.1.3.1 for occasional
sex-marking in adjectives.

    zenbait 'some, several' (in some varieties), hainbat and hainbeste 'so

(c) question words, such as zein 'which?', zer 'what?', zenbat 'how many?,
    how much?';

    ever you like', and the now archaic ezein 'any'.","[146, 147, 148]"

The pronoun zu is listed with the plurals because it was historically a plural
and it still takes plural agreement in the verb; the innovating plural zuek
takes double plural agreement.
    The intimate singular hi is of extraordinarily restricted use. Its use is gen-
erally obligatory (a) between siblings, and (b) between close friends of the
same sex and roughly the same age, particularly those who have grown up
together. Its use is optional (a) in addressing children (whether one's own or
not), and (b) in teasing, cursing or abusing (people or animals). It is not
normally used (a) in addressing an adult of the opposite sex (except a sib-
ling), not even a spouse, (b) in addressing a significantly older person (in-
cluding a parent), or a person of superior status, (c) in addressing an animal
(except when abusing it), (d) in addressing God. Basque-speakers do not
normally change from zu to hi for any reason at all, and so one may find a
70-year-old man addressing a 55-year-old neighbor with hi and receiving zu
in return, because long ago a 20-year-old man chose to address his five-
year-old neighbor with hi.
    Some eastern varieties have another second-person pronoun xu, a palatal-
ized form of zu; this is intermediate in intimacy between zu and hi. Some
southern varieties have a very formal second-person pronoun berori, used
only in addressing a person of markedly superior status; this is formed from
ber- 'self, 'same', plus hori, the mesial demonstrative. A few eastern varie-
ties have a formal second-person singular pronoun ori\ this is derived from
the mesial demonstrative hori.
    In general, Basque lacks true third-person pronouns, and demonstratives
are used when third-person pronouns are required for thematic purposes.
Western varieties, however, have acquired third-singular bera and third-
plural berat, these consist of ber- 'self' and the article -a (historically the
distal demonstrative), and represent extensions of the intensive third-person
pronouns (see section 3.1.6.1.2). Bizkaian has a curious variant eurak for
berak.
    Personal pronouns cannot be modified directly. A second-person pro-
noun, however, can be modified indirectly by using the mesial demonstra-
tive hori as a pronoun, as in(114) Hain argia zaren         horrek     jakin   beharko    zenuke.
      so    clever are.COMP that.ERG      know    must.FUT AUX
      'You, who are so clever, ought to know.'","[180, 181]"
"Sentence (1883) is an example where relativization is blocked because the
relativized NP is a non-subcategorized adverbial NP (see (1874)). The ap-
parently similar example (1884) is not rejected, since in the latter the head
noun bears the same case as the relativized NP. This contrast shows that
there is a general interpretive rule which attributes to the relativized NP the
same case as that of the whole phrase. This is confirmed by the observation
that mistakes resulting from case parallelism are often produced in child
language.",[811]

3.1.3. Adjectives3.1.3.1. Lexical adjectivesBasque has a large and open class of adjectives, and adjectives are rather
sharply distinguished from other parts of speech: as a rule, a word which is
an adjective cannot also be another part of speech. There are just a handful
of mostly ancient exceptions which can serve as either adjectives or nouns,
like Hun 'dark' and 'darkness', hotz 'cold' (ADJ.) and 'cold' (n.) (opposite of
'heat'), bero 'hot' and 'heat', and gose 'hungry' and 'hunger', plus a couple
of adjectives which can also serve as verbs, like hil 'dead' and both 'die'
and 'kill', and busti 'moist' and 'moisten'. (Such cases must not be con-
                                                           The noun phrase   137
fused with headless NPs containing adjectives; see section 3.1.5.) Lexical
adjectives may be morphologically simple (handi 'big', gorri 'red'), they
may be derived from other words by means of the numerous adjective-
forming suffixes (euritsu 'rainy', from euri 'rain', diruzale 'avaricious',
from diru 'money'), or they may be compounds (larrugorri 'naked', from
larru 'skin' plus gorri 'red', ahobero 'indiscreet', from aho 'mouth' plus
bero 'hot').
    Virtually all lexical adjectives follow their head noun within an NP, but a
small number of adjectives may or must precede the head noun; see section
3.1.3.2 below. Some adjectives may also occur as appositions following the
noun phrase, see
    There is no formal difference between restrictive and non-restrictive ad-
jectives: liburu zaharra 'the old book' can be understood either restrictively
(""as opposed to the new one"") or non-restrictively (""the only book under
discussion, which happens to be old"").
    There are two lexical adjectives derived from relative forms of finite
verbs: den (B G dan) 'all', from da 'is', and zen (B G zari) 'late' (i.e., 'de-
ceased'), from zen ~ zan 'was', as in gizon denak 'all the men' and Koldo
Mitxelena zena 'the late Luis Michelena'. (In the north, dena, plural denak,
is strictly pronominal, and cannot be used as an adjective.)
    A number of adjectives, mostly borrowed from Spanish, exceptionally
exhibit sex-marking. An example is majo 'nice', which has a female variant
maja applied to women and girls; the unmarked variant majo is used in all
other circumstances (males, animals, inanimates, abstractions). Other exam-
ples include the loans tontoltonta 'foolish' and katoliko/katolika 'Catholic'.
Such sex-marking is confined to western varieties, and Β in particular may
have hundreds of these; eastern varieties invariably borrow only the mascu-
line form of a Romance adjective and apply it indiscriminately to both sexes
in Basque.
    Multiple adjectives are possible. The order is usually exactly the reverse
of English, or exactly the same in terms of distance from the head noun, as
in:(100) etxe zuri txiki polit bat
       house white little pretty a
      'a pretty little white house'But other orders can occur, as in the popular song
138   Morphology(101) txakur txiki     gorritxo     bat
        dog       small red.DlM     a
       'a little red dog'   Transitive adjectives exist, governing complement phrases in various
cases but most often in the instrumental:(102) Bere lan-az          harroa         dago.
        his   work.LNST proud.DET is
       'She is proud of her work.'","[166, 167, 168]"
"    The three demonstratives and the definite article all distinguish number
(singular versus plural), and an NP bearing one of these is always explicitly
singular or plural. No other determiners distinguish number, and hence an
NP which does not contain one of these four is never marked for number,
though it will often be semantically singular or plural, with (in many varie-
ties) the corresponding verbal agreement. Examples: zein gizon? 'which
man?, which men?', diru asko 'lots of money', bi liburu (B liburu bi) 'two
books', zenbait ume gazte 'several young children'
3.1.2.2. ArticlesThere are two articles, the so-called definite article -a (singular), -ak (plu-
ral), and the so-called indefinite article bat. The first of these is used more
broadly than its name would suggest, the second more narrowly.
                                                            The noun phrase   119
3.1.2.2.1. The definite articleThe so-called definite article is a bound morpheme, -a in the singular and -
ak in the plural (historically derived from a distal demonstrative, see
3.1.2.3). With gizon 'man' and handi 'big', we thus have gizona 'the man',
gizonak 'the men', gizon handia 'the big man', and gizon handiak 'the big
men'. When this article is suffixed to a word ending in a vowel, there are
various phonological complications, for which see section 3.2.2. Ortho-
graphically, however, the only point of note is that a word-final 'a' merges
with the article: neska 'girl' + -a, -ak gives neska 'the girl', neskak 'the
girls'. (See also section 3.2.2 for phonological complications in the oblique
cases.)
   The label 'definite article' is misleading, since this article is of much
broader use than the English definite article. It occurs:(a) in an np which is definite and either is identifiable to the hearer or can
    be safely presumed by the hearer to exist: goizeko izarr-a 'the morning
    star', Erromaren jatorri-a 'the origin of Rome', txakurr-a 'the dog'
    (which I have previously mentioned).(b) in an NP which is identifiable to the speaker but not to the hearer(64) Emazte-a    dut/daukat.
     wife.DET have
     Ί have a wife.'","[148, 149]"
"
3.1.9. Nominalized verbsThere is one other important type of noun phrase: a gerund NP. This nomi-
nalized verbal form is constructed from a complete non-finite verb phrase,
with a lexical verb but no auxiliary verb, by adding to the verb-stem the
gerund suffix -te or -tze followed by the definite article -a. The resulting NP
can appear in any NP position in a sentence and must take any case-marking
appropriate to its grammatical position. See sections 3.5.1.2.1 and
4.10.1.1.2.1 for an account of these nominalizations.",[197]
"Normative practice favors absolutive marking regardless of animacy.
598 Syntax
    Turning now to causativization of unaccusative predicates with a second,
dative argument, we will differentiate cases where the dative of the basic
verb stands for a goal argument and cases where it represents the experi-
encer of a psychological predicate. Beginning with goal datives, causativi-
zation proceeds as described above. If the 'causee' is inanimate, it will re-
tain the absolutive case, both in eastern and western dialects:(1342) Ez zekien nork helerazi       zion eskutitz hura
        not knew who reach.CAUSE AUX letter           that
        aita    Santuari.
        father holy.DAT
       'He did not know who made that letter reach the Holy Father.'
       [HEH.helerazi]The dative is kept for the goal argument. This is also the situation one finds
with animate causees in eastern dialects. However, in western dialects,
which usually mark animate causees dative, a doubling of dative nominale
would result, a situation which presents processing problems which render it
unacceptable in many cases (see 4.8.2.3 below). This can be avoided in the
(b), 'western' pattern by reserving dative marking for the causee, and substi-
tuting an allative marker for the goal argument originally expressed with the
dative:(1343) Mikel diru      eske        etorri zait.
       Mikel money asking.for come AUX.3A/1D
       'Mikel came up to me asking for money.'(1344) a.    Beharrak     Mikel     diru   eske
