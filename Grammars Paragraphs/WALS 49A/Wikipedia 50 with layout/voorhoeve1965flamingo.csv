I l l THE ACCENTIntroduction39
  To the most recent investigations in the field of accent belong the
studies of the American linguist D. L. Bolinger. In 1958, the results
of a number of experiments he had made were published.8 These
showed that the most important cue in determining stress in English
is what he terms 'prominence of pitch', i.e. ""a rapid and relatively  I owe this term to: K L. Pike, Phonetics, University of Michigan, Ann
  Arbor, 1958, p. 93.

  pp. 109-149.

wide departure from a smooth or undulating contour"".g By 'departure'
Bolinger means a deviation in a contour which then continues in the
                                                                      - or
same pitch - ' -           or - -, as well as a sudden rise -
fall - , after which it continues on a higher or a lower level.
   w i t h r e g a r d to Asrnat, it could be established that in most cases
the accent is accompanied by a clear and sudden rise or fall of the
pitch. Four cases can be distinguished :1. The accented vowel has a higher tone than the rest of the contour:2. The accented vowel has a higher tone than the contour preceding it :3. The accented vowel has a lower tone than the contour preceding it:
                                       -
                                           --
4. The accented vowel has a higher tone than the contour following it:
     It is clear that in 3, and 4 'pitch' alone does not determine the
accent. There must be other factors that cause the difference. Bolinger,
who describes a parallel case in English, attributes the determination
of accent in this case to different factors: context, phonetic reduction,
and contiguous 'unaccentables3.10 It is not possible, however, for me
to determine in how far similar factors are also active in Asmat This
would require special investigation.
  There are also cases in which I noted accent without being able
to discern a deviation in the pitch by ear. In some of these cases it
could be established that the accented vowel was rather longer than
the contiguous non-accented vowels. It was often not possible, however,
to determine by ear what the accent-determining factors were.3-1 9   Id. p. 112.
^ Id. pp. 136, 137.
1-1 I n the  above mentioned article, Bolinger remarks that psychological factors
     play a role in the interpretation of phonetic data as accent: data interpretable
     as accent may be ignored by a person speaking his mother tongue, when they
     occur in places where he knows from experience that there is no accent.
     (p. 136, 137). This presents the possibility that, on the one hand, a linguist

The general principle of accentuation
40
   The general principle of accentuation is : there is a reqular alternation
of accented and unaccented vowels.
   I n certain cases, however, sequences of two, at most three, un-
accented vowels occur.
   Furthermore, there are some cases of multi-vowelled onomatopoeia
in which no alternation of accented and unaccented vowels is found:
     iriririri   imitating"" the sound produced by many small objects
                 falling down.
     M s E       imitating the hissing of fire as it is put out.12
   The factors which co-operate to produce the accent pattern of a
word are : the morphological structure of the word, and the accents
of contiguous words in the context.","[35, 36, 37]"

The personal possessive pronouns can form groups with :
substantives :   no cdm           my house
proper names :   no Tbazuuc       I am Teawuc
adjectives :     no om&           I am afraid
verbs :          4 mafewit        I will have it

have already been given in Â 209).

2. The demonstrative class
220
This class consists of the demonstrative pronoun e/er, the neutral
pronoun afar and the three demonstrative pronouns without variants :
ja, jdka and dtar.
                                  A
The A variant was always found, except in the following cases; in
these, the B variant occurred exclusively:
1. as the single word in a sentence :
   ar here; er there.
2. linked to the directional pronouns :
   or or this way; i r or that way, over there,
3. linked to:
      a r h (5 245) dr draw this is it; here it is.
      & ardw that is it.
      nms2rim      &r Â¥mas2ri        and next ; and then
      ?$in%        ir~ziw             a little bit to that side
      f i c i r i m d r picirim       to here (and no further).
Cases in which the demonstrative pronoun was linked to en, pen, am
or uw, were not met with in the material I worked on.
4. before the final a which occurs in exclamations: era! hey, there!222
a/or     points to:
1. that which is by, or in the direct neighbourhood of the speaker:
   a fir cu serdpmodmd
      this /fish trap/ who /you put it down/
      who are you, who have put down this fish trap ? (5 269).

      there only forest only pp there Sirec
      there was only the forest, there by the Sirkc (the locale of the story)
      (8 290).
3. to that which is simultaneous, or almost so, with the action spoken
of, or the happening narrated:
      a /hari Minggu/ 8 8 cowdk jiwi ta.kds aj mupicin atawaHc
      this Sunday one children all new clothes receiving
      this very Sunday, all the children will get new clothes.","[163, 164, 165]"
"
NegationsOnly the following forms of the verb can precede negations :
1. the m-/mV- and the m-/mV-@ forms :
2. the tense and tense-aspect categories of verbs of which the core
contains the formative por == to wish, to try to. These verbal forms
only occur in combination with @k/pak, opO~s.l/powand @nakdw/
pZnakhw. These negations then express a contrariness which can be
translated by : but no, but in vain.opdk/pak    not, without
ufidk and pak alternate freely, except after verbs with the formative
for, where opik always occurs. pak was usually found after the m-/mV-
and the m-/wtV-dji forms of the verb; in other cases op6k was usually
found.opdk/pak can form groups with :
the m-fmV- forms of the verb: m@or pdk embf            I did not see it;
                                  see not /did   I/
substantives :       a d s ojdk there is no sago
adjectives :         akdt opdk it is not good
personal possessive pronouns : or pdk not you
cowdk one, all :     up& cowdk absolutely not
mt much, many : opdk wut by no means
flak not:            opdk fiak really ! positively !
                     not not
Cases in which opdk is preceded by the verbal forms mentioned in
 239, 2. are:
166                          THE ASMAT LANGUAGE
    Serkw matowoj un arewfdjporamdr ophk iba
    /people of Serew / in order to kill/ pp /they assembled/ not pp
   the people of Screw gathered to kill her, but in vain ($ 338).
    ""manic"" ajipor opdk eat it, he said, but in vain.
   /eat it / he said/ not
opow/pow      not, without
The distribution of o    m and pow is parallel to that of opdk and pak.
I could not find a distinct difference in meaning between o$hk/pak and
o p h / p o w . I got the impression from the examples to hand that the
relationship between opdk/pak and opow/pow is parallel to that
between the non-mood and the mood forms of the verb. opow/pow
was only found in direct speech, in sentences in which the speaker
gives expression to varying moods.op6w/pow was found linked to :
the m-/mV- forms of the verb:
   Sujit masetdj powd       Sajit has not arrived !
   Sajit arrived not !substantives :
   amds of&       there is no sago!personal possessive pronouns :
   no op6w I am not there!","[177, 178]"
"61
I n addition to the preceding cases a number of isolated cases of free
variation were noted. I n these cases the same formal difference was
not found to recur in a series of pairs of variants.
I will give here only the variants of two words which occur frequently
in the texts:
     1. dsinerhm, m h e r i m , masirim, midrim, msnim then, thereupon.
     2. mariw, ma& ; &, mare ready, finished.

The following morphological processes occur :
A. Frequently occurring processes :
      1. suffixation: occurs with verbs, substantives, proper names,
         adjectives, and personal-possessive pronouns.
      2. prefixatim: occurs only with verbs.
      3. reduplication: occurs only within the core of the verb and
         consists of the repetition of the first two phonemes of the under-
         lying form. When the latter consists of two phonemes only, this
         process results in dupIication (5 79).
      4. composition: occurs with verbs, proper names and substantives.
B. Processes occurring exceptionally :
   5. infixation : was only found to occur instead of prefixation within
         the core of the verb in three cases (8 76).
      6. infixation, simultaneous with suffixation: was only found to
         occur instead of suffixation within the core of the verb in three
         cases ($ 82).
      7. modification : was only found instead of prefixation in one
         case ($ 76).
      8. multiplication: only two cases were noted : one of triplication
         of an adjective ($ 200) and one of quadruplication of a verbal
         root ($ 79).","[52, 53]"
"Adjectives, in addition, can be linked with words which express 'a great
degree of. I got the impression that these words cannot be linked to
all adjectives. Thus I found :

      tar$ kor           very long (ago)

VI DEICTIC WORDSIntroduction206
Asmat has a number of deictic words which fall into two main groups:
I. non-interrogative pronouns ; 11. interrogative pronouns.
I. The non-interrogative pronouns, if we set aside the derivative forms,
can be set out in the folllowing scheme:                                                       ...............
                 no / nor               e / e r      1      ariw
                                    ...............
                  na/mr                   ja
                                          jh ka
                  ca / car                dtar                 personal            demonstrative       directional
                 possessiveThe form of this scheme rests on the following considerations:
1. the noln-interrogative pronouns fall into three class,es:
   personal possessive pronouns ; demonstrative pronouns ; and
   tional pronouns ;
   Of these, only the personal possessive pronouns have morphological
   valence ;
                                   WORD-CLASSES                                 1432. there is one 'neutral' deictic word, q'w, which links up with all
      three classes ;
3. I n all three classes we find pairs of word-variants: one variant
   ending in a vowel, the other in r.
The scheme makes it clear that there is a certain formal connection
between the classes: 1) because the deictic word a/ar belongs, to1 all
three classes; 2) because the same type of word-variants occurs in all
three classes.
Only with these deictic words do word-variants with and without
final r occur systeniatically : outside the deictic words, only a few
isolated cases were found.3611. The interrogative pronouns are ca/com, ucim and ucina.k/uci/uc.
I n this group the neutral deictic word a/w does not occur, nor do
word-variants with and without final r. The reasons for treating them
as one group will be given in $ 232.","[153, 154, 155]"

1 The Asmat language: area, adjacent languages, dialects   The language of the Asmat Papuans, Asmat,l is one of a number
of related Papuan languages which are spoken over an extensive area
of the coastal plain of South-West New Guinea (Irian Barat). These
languages extend along the coast from the River Opa in the nolrth-west
to the mouth of the River Digul in the south-east.2
   The Asmat region is generally considered to be the coastal strip
and the adjacent hinterland between the Rivers Momkc (Le Cocq
d'Armandville) and Ewtii. In addition to his region, however, Asmat

Sirkc (Eilanden) and Wildeman; on the coastal strip between the
Ewtk and Cook Bay (the Casuarinen Coast) ; and in a few villages
on the coast between Cook Bay and the mouth of the River Digul.
   I t is still not known with certainty how far inland the Asmat

brought under Government control and that part of the low-lying
plain abutting onto the mountainous country in the centre is still
practically terra incognita. Up to now, Asmat villages have been
encountered inland to a distance of more than 70 miles.

                           THE ASMAT LANGUAGE
to Asmat, KAn~oroand Skmpan, are spoken. These two languages
cover the whole coastal area between the Rivers Opa and Otakwa.
Between the Otakwa and the MomAc, where the Asmat language-area
begins, there are no villages. Nothing is known about the languages
to the north and the north-east of the Asmat language-area : in the east
and the south-east, Asmat meets up with the Awju and Jakaj languages,
which are probably not related to Asmat.3
   Asmat has various dialects, but a systematic investigation into them
has not yet been made, so that little is known about the nature and
extent of the dialectical variations. Broadly, Asmat dialects can be
divided into a central group of little differing dialects with, around it,
on the periphery of the Asmat language-area, a number of dialects
differing sharply from it: those spoken upstream of the Rivers Pomiic
(Noordwest), Unir (Lorentz) and Sirkc, and the dialect of the
Casuarinen Coast.","[7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]"
"These will here be treated as a group for the following reasons:
1. they can occur in combination with a postposition am, which only
   occurs in combination with interrogatives;
2. they can olnly occur with particular forms of the verb.ca/com : ca occurs in all cases except immediately preceding the post-
position am : in this case corn occurs.  k&r:      loan-word from Malay, = kapal.

w occurs before the directional pronouns a/ar and adw.
I n addition, u c i and uc occur in the two alternating forms wid and 2 x 2 ,
which occur in contexts in which the speaker expresses annoyance or
uneasiness. These forms have the final 2, dealt with in $ 33.
The syntactical valence of the interrogatives is still not fully known
to me. The structure of the sentences in which they occur is not always
clear. I t can only be said with certainty that they can form groups
with substantives and verbs.
I shall deal first with those cases in which the interrogatives occur
in combination with a m ; then I shall discuss those in which they occur
without am.","[169, 170]"
"8 Research in Ag-ats and Jepem  I began the investigation at Agats, but since Agats was completely
outside the sphere of Asmat society - it was a 15-minute walk from
Surh - I decided, once I had surmounted the first difficulties of the
language, to continue it in one of the Asmat villages in the vicinity
of Agate. By living amidst the Asmat people I would be able quietly
to observe the way in which Asmat society functioned and would
become acquainted with the people and their language. Surfi was less
suitable as a place in which to stay because the presence of the Govern-
ment and the Missions had to a certain extent already influenced the
way of life there. The village of Jepkm, where both my informants
had relatives, appeared to be the most suitable, and from May, 1961,
the investigation was carried on from there, interrupted from time
to time by a short sojourn in Agats.
   During the period of my stay in the Asmat region, the Dutch scholar,
Dr. A. A. Gerbrands, and the American student D. B. Eyde, were
also there: the former doing research into Asrnat art, similarly under
the auspices of W.O.N.G., and the latter doing ethnological field work.
Their presence was of great value in acquiring as good an insight as
                             INTRODUCTION                             9possible into Asmat culture. Many were the pleasurable and stimulating
discussions we had when we were together, either in the house of
the W.O.N.G. in Agats or at the 'Wong Club', as Dr. Gerbrands'
house in the village of Amhamkaj was called. During the last year,
a lively correspondence on mythological and linguistic subjects was
kept up with Eyde. A knowledge of mythology seemed to be of the
greatest importance for acquiring an insight into Asmat culture, and
it was for this reason that I put as many tales as possible on the tape.
I collected approximately 80 texts, but these represent only a fraction
of the wealth of stories the Asmat people know.

I THE PHONOLOGICAL SYSTEMIntroduction
   The phonological description is based on the speech of the two
principal informants. In the cases where their speech deviates from
that of other people speaking the same dialect, the difference will be
mentioned.
   The system used for the phonetic spelling is that followed by the
American linguist, K, L. Pike, in his work ""Phonemics"".~ The
phonetic transcription, in accordance with usual practice, is put between
square brackets; the phonematic transcription between solidi. In the
phonetic spelling, the accent is indicated by a sign placed before
the accented vowel Fa] : in the phonematic spelling, by a sign above
the accented vowel /a/, The following signs are also used : # = other
than; Q = alternating with; C = consonant; V = vowel.
  The term duster means a biarticulate, non-geminate intervocalic
consonant cluster. The terms initial, media! and final indicate positions
in the word.","[20, 21, 22]"

  To sum up one can say that the vowel phonemes form a system of
three contrasting tongue heights. At the highest level, there is a
contrast front - back /i - u/; at the middle level, a contrast front -
central - back /e - C - o / ; while at the lowest level only /a/ occurs:
  According to my informants, the word [ond'Gw] was used only by the people
  who originated from the village of Kajt?. I had the impression that now only
  the older people within this group use it. The younger people, as well as the

   From the fo'regoing it is clear that a rounded allophone of /i/ and
/e/ occurs in analogous cases, while a rounded and an unrounded
allophone of /u/ and / o / , respectively, occur in analogous cases,. Later
it will become clear that there is a close connection between /i/ and /u/,
and between /e/ and /o/ which manifests itself in their occurrence
in word variants (see 8 55, 56) and in aflomorphs (see 5 91, 98).","[27, 28]"
"Deviations from this regularity are found :
1. when the personal possessive pronoun is linked to a substantive
having one vowel, which is initial :
   no h my drum ; o 6 your pig ;
Besides these, however, one always finds :

It is possible that here the homonymy has led to a need for differen-
tiation.

"Cases of transposition191
The one definite case of transposition I found is the word jiwinakap,
which occurs as a substantive with the meaning 'small child' (from
jiwi, child), and as an adjective with the meaning 'small"". This case
will be dealt with when the adjective is discussed.
Transposition to the class of substantives probably occurs in the
following cases :1. The adjectives a d large, and jhinakap small, occur in the fol-
lowing sentence in positions in which one would expect substantives
to occur :

      2. ['I alternates with [s] in normal speech, i.e., speech that is
      neither deliberately slow nolr intentionally emphatic. I n the cases
      noted, ['I always occurs after a vowel. The phonetic quality of this
      allophone is difficult to define by ear. I found it markedly similar
      to a voiceless glottal fricative [h], When, however, I deliberately
      pronounced an [h] in such cases, my informants thought it ridi-
      culous. I t is probably a weak alveolar fricative. Regrettably, I have
      not been succcessf~ilin reproducing this allophone : [amb'as, ambfas]
      sago ; [des'cn, W e n ] none.
      3. [.%I and [i?] occur especially in the speech of older people.
      I got the impression that they are not alternants of [s], but that
       [El and [ 8 ] are distributed throughout the vocabulary in a way
      which varies from person to person.27
/r/      Allophones : [TI,[r].
      1. [r] occurs in all positions except in initial position and as the
      last consonant of a cluster (5 48, 53) : [tEr'E] rattan leaf; [arpfuk]
      far away ; [ir] year bird.
      2. [r] Y, [g] was found only in the speech of small children and
      in the speech of the regular informants. I t is not beyond question
      that a consequence of the latter regularly speaking Malay with [TI,
      is their using it now and then in their mother tongue.28

   2. The nmal occurs in all other cases, and, in addition, in initial

1 The core category
KM
The cores form a category that is distinguished from all other a t e -
gories by the absence of a categorial element of form. Their common
semantic element is difficult to define on the basis of the 31 cases
I noted. Tentatively, it can be said that these cases fall into' two groups :
a. one comprising a number of cases in which the core seems to be
characterized by the absence of all other categorial meanings and only
relates to the action or the happening as such :
     a Wok tetdm, a Mis i e t h , 2 a niwi tetdm, inim a-e-f
     here Wok give here Mis give there his father give /that's what / he did/

238
I shall now deal with a number of words that have no rnorpho'logical
valence and which cannot yet be classified into a definite word-class
because the material is insufficient for this purpose. That I have,
nevertheless, divided them into negations and postpositions is due to
the fact that the negations, at least, have a feature common to them,
one which is not found in the postpositions : only specific forms of the
verb can occur before negations. The feature characteristic of the
postpositions is that they always occur at or within the end of a
word-group.43
The syntactical valence of the negations and postpositions, like that
of the interrogatives, is still not fully known to me. In so far as I have
been able to determine it with certainty will it be mentioned, and
examples will be given.
In additioln, cases will also be given of the occurrence of negations and
postpositions in sentences of which the syntactical structure has not
yet been determined.","[175, 176]"
"Words having two vowels :
   As a rule, these have the accent on the second vowel. In the material
I collected, the following words, however, have the accent on the
first vowel :
     mimkam      kind of liana
     irk 13      Spanish pepper
     j4wa        kind of grass

     USt         a tree fallen over a river   working on a language foreign to him, interprets phonetic data as accent
   where the man speaking his mother tongue would not do so, and on the
   other, that he errs in ignoring phonetic data when they occur in places
   where he does not anticipate them. So, the fact that most words with two
   vowels have the accent on the second vowel, caused me to overlook for a
   considerable time a number of cases in which the accent falls on the first vowel.

   The general principle of accentuation also applies to these words
with, however, the limitation that in specific cases, to' be mentioned
later, a sequence of two unaccented vowels occurs.
   With regard to the position of the accent, or the first accent where
the word concerned has more than one accent, the following rules apply :1. The accent falls on the first vowel when the first morpheme has
only one vowel :
   0.few       relatives

          the verbal forms in the paradigms are shown without any prefixes. When
          prefixes do occur, they are given separately below the paradigms;
          in the forms, only the junction between the core and the peripheral part
          is shown: in the usual manner, by a dash. The morpheme structure of the
          peripheral part can be deduced by comparing the different forms and from
          the discussion on the formal characteristics of the categories which will
          be given immediately after the paradigms;
          when the phonological structure of the core influences the form of the
          suffixes following the core, the paradigms of the different verbs will be
          given in order to demonstrate this influence;
          in general, a translation will only be given of one of the series of forms.

similar suffix is absent in the form of the object category I. Object
category I is here characterized by the absence of an element of form
which is correlated with the categorical meaning. In a case such as this,
we can say that the object category is characterized by zero.
If we compare the form an-; with the other forms of the paradigm,
then we see that here the modal suffix c is absent: the imperative is
therefore characterized by zero. Besides an-i, the form with modal

/</ I n addition to the vowels /a, e, i, o, u/ there occurs a mid-central

      river; [dfw'et, daw^t] elder brother ; [do 'not, do 'nat] I (stressed) ;
       [jumb'us, j am'as] with bowed head.
      In the second place, it does not alternate with one of the other
      vowels, for example in [Cam'en] penis ; [san'en] elbow; [?~mb'ow]
      abuse; [j'qpsres] sweat; [and'ow] mother.
      It also occurs in a number of verbal suffixes, such as: [-an, -ar].

   ment in which the other vowels do not occur, is excluded by the
   occurrence of word pairs, like the following:
                          [Eem]     = house
                          [Eam'an] = space under the house
    [Eam'en] = penis      [turnran] = a burn
                          [Eim'in] = the temple (of the head)
                          [combfit] = sponge made of young sago leaves

    [and'ow] mother ; [oncTow] thatch ;3
    [&porfes]they saw him (from por - to see) ;
    [&parfes] they sat (from ap - to sit).
   Since [a] occurs in the accented as well as the unaccented position
   in those cases in which it alternates with the other vowels, it is not
   possible to regard it here as an allophone common to /a, e, i, o, u/
   which is restricted to unaccented positions. Because [a] also occurs
   without alternating with the other vowels, in which cases I found
   some minimal pairs, it must be regarded as a phoneme be/. Cases
   of alternation must be regarded as cases of phoneme alternation.

"12 The habitual category13s
This category, like categories 13 to 15, inclusive, and 18 to 21, inclusive,
is a tense-aspect category with separate characteristics of form for
indicating time and aspect. In this category, as in the two previous
categories, a series of formal and a series of informal forms occur.
These two series are, in addition, opposed to a third series of forms
which express a particular mood of the speaker, such as, for example :
joy, excitement, vexation, disappointment. These forms I shall call
mood forms. The formal and the informal forms are, in this respect,
neutral. I n addition, a few interrogative forms were noted. These occur
only in the traditional stories. I get the impression that they have an
archaic character. Outside the traditional tales, I found in questions only
the non-interrogative forms, followed by the question marker en/an.17136
(Paradigms: see pp. 94-95)
I noted the following interrogative forms :
     1. t e t h - c e m a m   shall I give him
       3. t e t h - c W n &            will you give him
       6. tetam-cemdn                  will he give him

Tense suffix: from a comparison with the forms of category 13, it
appears that here the time suffix is zero.

-p occurs in all forms, except when the object suffix and the subject
suffix are zero'; in that case, -@ occurs.
Interrogative suffix : -an.

  an aspect suffix -m in form 6. (before -op) :

"The verbal core can be monomorphematic or polymqhematic. The
peripheral part consists of prefixes and/or suffixes added to the core.
   The mutual independence of the core and the peripheral part shows
itself in a difference in internal organization which makes a separate
description of the two parts necessary.
   Their mutual dependence shows itself in the fact that: a. a verb
consists either of a core, or of a core +   peripheral part, but never of
a peripheral part alone; and b. there are a number of verbal categories
that do not occur with cores ending with the morphemes iturn, es, it
or u w e ~(see 5s 91-94).
                            WORD-CLASSES
The morphological structure of the core
     Only provisional observations can be made here about the structure
of the core. The reason for this is that the main point of research, as
regards the verb, was an investigation into the verbal categories. An
insight into the structure of the verbal system proved to' be a pre-
requisite if I were to understand and to speak the Asmat language.
The relative independence of the core made it possible, temporarily
to leave its structure outside consideration. Since, however, research
into the verbal categories took most of the available time, there was
none left for a systematic examination of the cores. This remains one
of the most important tasks for future research.
  Consequently, the paragraphs on co-re-structure, as well as the para-
graphs on core-morphology, represent only a preliminary reconnaissance
in the field. The picture of the core-structure given here is for the
main part based on indirect information, i.e. information obtained from
an analysis of a specific corpus of verbal cores of which only a small
part was elicited from the informants with this analysis in view. This
corpus of verbal cores consists of 2 3,000 cores, of which Â±1.200
occur in the texts to be appended to this grammatical description.","[54, 55]"
"5 The m-/mV- -6ji/dji category112
m-    occurs before an initial vowel;
d-occurs before an initial consonant: the vowel is identical to the
first vowel of the core, or a (// t~$-/mV-8 111).
-&ji occurs in all cases, except when the core ends in the durative
formative, which in this category has the allomorph ewer; in this case
-6occurs. The first vowel of the suffix is always accented.
The forms of this category only differ from those of the preceding
category in having a semantic element that can be translated with
usually ; always' :
      m5 cufinmi ma-kondwams-hji
      I land /usually go to sleep/

No difference in meaning could be found between the forms with and
without a prefix and between forms with -mas, -&us,           -ajmos or
-ejimos. -djimos only occurs with cores ending in the durative formative,
which here occurs in the allomorph &.

that we are here dealing with a suffix -a/aj/ej'i, followed by a suffix
-ma. The suffix - a / a j / i j i is probably identical with the suffix -bji
of the forms of category 5. The forms of the -ajmos and the -6jpurUw
category are used to comment on something that, in the opinion of the
speaker, is not as it ought to be.
The forms of the -djmos category have a semantic element of exhor-
tation in common :

                               TEXTSINTRODUCTIONRecording and presentation
The ten stories presented here are only a selection of tho'se recorded
on tapes. Eight of the sttories were narrated by youths of 14 to 17 years
of age and the recording's were made either at my house in Agats or
in my house in Jepkm. One story, (VI), was tolid by a woman and was
recorded in her own house and one, (X), narrated by an older man,
was recorded in the ceremonial house.
During the narration, the speaker sat cross-legged on the ground on
a sleeping mat, according to Asmat custom. And, since the stories
were being told to an audience, the hand microphone, on its holder,
was placed on the ground in front of the narrator. A number of
listeners were always present during the recording sessions. The
speaker was only interrupted during the telling of the story when a
new tape had to be put on.
The recorded stories were later transcribed and translated with the
help of my informants. For the transcripts, they repeated the stories
word by word, and the translating of each story was only done when
the transcription had been completed.
The stories have been presented - as far as it has been practicable
to do sol - as they were told by the narrators : recapitulations, anaco-
lutha, corrections made by the speakers, sudden changes of theme, and
asides have been retained. Any errors of speech which, in my opinion,

The transcripts given here are based on the word-by-word repetition
of the stories by my informants, who' sometimes deviated from the
original by using another word-variant, or another word, or by using
an Asmat word instead of a Malay word used by the narrator. In these
cases the word used by the latter is given in a note.
To facilitate the reading of the texts these have been divided into
relatively short paragraphs. One paragraph of the Asmat text corres'-
ponds to one paragraph of the translation. If any notes occur in a

the notes to the Asmat text as well as the notes to the translation have
been added to the Asmat text.
The spelling of the texts is phonematic ; the special phonological sounds
are written as shown in $ 32, note. The accent is always indicated.
The x indicates the sound made by striking the cupped hand with
the fist. The narrators sometimes did this when the passage dealt with
chopping, striking, spearing, or when they wanted to indicate a thud
o r a crack, o r a sudden start of an action. Since the striking of the
cupped hand with 'the fist often whollly o r partly took the place of a
verbal description, i,t seemed advisable to indicate this sound in the
transcription. A sentence such as : Taweric amds . . . 'Taweric sago' . . .
cannot be understood unless the accompanying sounds made by the
narrator are represented: Taweric amds x A- x x 'Taweric chopped
down sago palms'.
In addition, the following punctuation-marks will be used :
the comma, to indicate a nail-final pause in the speech of the narrator;
the full stop, to' indicate a final pause, after a noii-exclamatory sentence ;
the ex~larnatio~n    mark, to indicate a final pause after an exclamatory
sentence ;
the dash, to indicate a sudden change of theme;
quotation marks, to indicate statements in direct speech.
 No. capital letters will be used, except for proper names.","[190, 191, 192, 193]"

A category about which meagre data were obtained is that of the forms
characterized by the suffix -mZr. I only got form 6 from the informants,
so that I thought for a long time that I was dealing with an isolated
case. Later, froim the texts it appeared that other forms also occur.
The forms with -m& relate to the past. I n addition, they have a semantic
element of repetition which is translatable with 'each day again'.
The following forms were noted :

"But when this is not the case, it has an accent on the first vowel, as
for example in:
    niwi father              -   niwi.4 hey, father!    phkaj is not included in the list given in 8 41, because it is a bound morpheme
    (verbal formative, see $67).
                            THE ASMAT LANGUAGEWords in context45
  The principle of the regular alternation of accented and unaccented
vowels also operates in word sequences, though not so rigidly as
within a word.
This is expressed by:1. the accentuation of words with one vowel; this appears to be
governed by this principle, as for example in :
     wdn ow nbt cem map ent.6tepdkajpife.s in
     some people pp houses ahead /had gone upriver and sat together/ pp
     some of the people had gone ahead upriver to their houses and sat
     there together.2. the influence which accents in words in sequence can have on
each other:
     a. words which in isolation have an accent on the first vowel, do
     not have this accent when, in context, a word with final accent
     precedes it; or, instead of it, have an accent on the second vowel:
     dm-oh       you made it.     a p6 ca &-or.&       who made this paddle?
     this paddle who /you made it/     a p6 cd e m - 0 y . h who made this paddle ?
     this paddle who /you made it/     md.ne.m-0r.h      you chopped down.
     ucim os md.ne.m-or.&       which tree have you chopped down?
     which tree /you chopped down/     os cd ma.nd.m-or.&      who has chopped down the tree.
     tree who /you chopped down/     b. words which in isolation have an accent on the last vowel do
     not have this accent when, in context, a word with initial accent
     follows it; or, instead, have an accent on the penultimate vowel:
     dsawic   banana
     6suwic d banana leaf

     p h a n c h , Roman c&        the houses on both sides (of the river).
     jother side/ house, /other side/ house46
Contrary to the general principle, sequences of two accented vowels
can occur in context. Unfortunately, I have not been able to discover
any definite regularity in their occurrence.
     Jomot dwse m k u here Kernsthe (river) Jornot (Â 309).

     door bolt47
   Because the rules of accentuation presuppose an insight into the
morpheme structure of the Asmat words which cannot be expected
from readers without a fair knowledge of the Asmat language, and
because in context changes in the accentuation of words often occur,
the accents will be shown throughout this work, except in the lists
of verbal cores 15' given in 8s 100-103, and in the verbal cores, given
in the word l i ~ t . 1 5 ~
IV THE DISTRIBUTION OF PHONEMES I N THE WORDSingle vowels and consonants
  All vowels occur word-initially, word-medially and word-finally,
except Z which does not occur word-finally.
  I found only the following exceptions to this rule: a) the onolmato-
lsaFor this term,   see $5 64-69.
IsbThe reasons for not showing the accents in these cases are: a. that only a
   few cores were found in isolation; b. that the morphological structure of many
   cores is still not fully known.
   In many cases it is therefore impossible to tell how the core in isolation will
   be accentuated.

"These forms are probably contractions of forms of category 3 and
j - e r m k . I think it not impossible that the forms with - e r d r o are
archaic. When I ran the text after the recording, the informants
repeated it word for word, and they always used in these cases forms
with -mZro instead of these with - e r H o : jbk apawh--mZro; wasen
dcukewir-mu.
Finally, a form with - m a d r o was found :

   Sure is there, he is busy every day making a very big canoe of

In tins case, the daily activity is seen as a process that is still unfinished.
Perhaps the -mZr forms are divided into a category of past tense forms
and another category of present tense forms.",[133]
