"ELLIPSIS
4.111 Ellipsis refers to the omission from a sentence of a
word when its presence is not necessary, often because the
word has already occurred, either in the same sentence or in a
preceding one. Sometimes pronouns can be omitted in
Indonesian where their presence is required in English. In
examples in sections 4.112-7 pronouns in translations to
examples are placed in square brackets where the
corresponding form in Indonesian is ellipted.
Ellipsis of subject
4.112 A subject can be omitted if it is clear from context.
In the following example Ki Demang is spoken to in the first
sentence; rather than a second person pronoun in the second
sentence ellipsis occurs:
   O, sombong kau, Ki Demang. Diminta air, malahan
   menyombongkan kekayaan.
   Oh, you are arrogant, Ki Demang. [You] are asked for
   water, instead [you] boast about [your] wealth.
The subject need not have been mentioned previously in the
discussion; it is sufficient that who is being talked about is
clear from context for pronouns to be ellipted:
   ""Makan malam di luar?"" ...
   ""Diundang teman lama' , sahut Febrian dengan
                             9   perasaan bersalah*
   ""Are [you] dining out?"" ...
   ""[I]'ve been invited by an old friend"", replied Febrian with
   a feeling of guilt.
If two clauses are in coordination and have the same subject
then the subject of the second clause can be ellipted:
    Mereka sudah lama kawin, tetapi belum punya anak.
    They have been married a long time but [they] don't yet
    have any children.
Further examples, with a variety of coordinators, are given in
section 4.64.
The subject of a subordinate clause can be omitted whether it
precedes or follows the main clause:
   Ali tidak pergi ke sekolah karena sakit
   Karena sakit Ali tidak pergi ke sekolah.
   Because [he] was sick Ali didn't go to school.
If the subordinate clause occurs first it can retain the subject.
In this case the noun can be replaced by a pronoun in the
main clause. However, the subject cannot be omitted entirely
from the main clause:
    Karena Ali sakit, dia tidak pergi ke sekolah.
    Because Ali was sick he didn't go to school.
Ellipsis of the subject after supaya/agar when acting as a
complement is discussed in section 3.122. The subject can
also be ellipted if supaya introduces a subordinate clause (see
4.74):
   Dia pergi ke perpustakaan supaya (dia) dapat membaca
   buku.
   He went to the library so that [he] could read a book.
Ellipsis of subject nouns referring to non-humans
4.113 When a noun referring to a human is understood
from context it is usually represented by a pronoun, as
repetition of the noun would sound awkward. In the case of a
noun referring to anything other than a human there is no
corresponding pronoun in many positions in the sentence
(see 2.74). In such cases ellipsis is the only alternative to
stylistically awkward repetion of the noun. In the following
example nira 'palm juice is omitted from the second
                              1sentence:
   Nira tidak bisa dibiarkan lama* Kalau tidak segera
   dimasak akan cepat jadi rusak.
   Palm juice cannot be left long. If [it] is not boiled at once
    [it] will quickly spoil.
In section 3.39 is an example where, after initial mention,
kaki ayam 'the chicken leg' is ellipted in three following
clauses.
Retention of parts of the noun phrase in ellipsis
4.114 If a noun is omitted a relative clause occurring
within the noun phrase can be retained. This is then
nominalised, as discussed in section 3.131. A number, along
with a classifier or measure noun, can also be retained. Other
components of the noun phrase, such as adjectives, attributive
nouns and possessives, cannot occur if the head noun is
omitted. In the following example the quantifier measure
noun segelas 'a glass (of something)' is retained in the second
sentence while the head noun susu 'milk' is ellipted. In the
third sentence the subject is a nominalised relative clause
yang lain 'the other', gelas (susu) being ellipted:
    Dia datang membawa susu dua gelas. Segelas
    diletakkannya di atas meja. Yang lain dibawanya
    padaku.
    She came carrying two glasses of milk. She put one glass
    on the table. The other she brought to me.
All nominalised relative clauses result from ellipsis of the
head of the noun phrase, examples being given in sections
3.131-5.
Ellipsis of words other than the subject
4.115 If an action or state has been mentioned it need not
be repeated in the following clause. Instead, the following
clause may contain just the subject and any words which do
not occur in the preceding clause or contrast with what has
been said:
   Saya sudah makan tapi mereka belum.
   I've eaten but they haven't yet.
   Majikannya tidak tahu ke mana dia pindah. Teman-
   temannya juga tidak tahu.
   Her employer didn't know where she had moved to. Her
   friends didn't know either.
Multiple ellipsis
4.116 It is not uncommon for ellipsis both of subject and
other redundant components of a clause to occur together.
The following sentence repeats an example given in section
4.95, with ellipted components of the correlative subordinate
clauses presented in square brackets:
   Entah [gagasannya] disetujui entah [gagasannya] tidak
   [disetujui], dia tetap akan mengusulkan gagasannya.
   Whether it is agreed to or not he will continue to propose
   his idea.
Ellipsis of possessives
4.117 Possessive pronouns can be ellipted. This is
especially common in the case of inalienable possession, such
as referring to body parts, when it is obvious who the
possessor is:
   Dia mengulurkan tangan kepadaku.
   He held out [his] hand to me.
   Mereka sedang menggosok gigi.
   They are cleaning [their] teeth.
Ellipsis in responses
4.118 In conversation ellipsis frequently occurs in one
person's response to what another says.
In response to a question words occurring in the question are
usually not repeated:
   Q: Siapa nama saudara? A: Jim.
        What's your name?               Jim.
   Q: Berapa harganya?           A: Tiga ribu.
        How much is it?                Three thousand.
   Q: Kapan saudara              A: Besok pagi*
      berangkat?
      When do you leave?              Tomorrow morning.
Responses to yes-no questions, in which ellipsis is usual, are
discussed in section 4.13.
Ellipsis is often used in a question when the context makes it
clear what is meant; often just the question word is used:
   Ada orang cari anda.             -       Siapa?
   There's someone looking          -       Who?
   for you.
When agreeing with someone or commenting on what they
have said ellipsis is also usual:
   Saya sudah ke sana.              -       Saya juga.
   I've been there.                 -       I have too.

Main entries are alphabetical except that plural s is ignored. Sub-entries
 are not alphabetical but generally in order of occurrence in the grammar.
 Affixes are listed alphabetically by their first letter, the hyphen being
 ignored. A free word is placed in order before a homophonous affix; thus
 anda precedes -anda.
The symbol > before a sub-entry cross references to the same item as a
  main entry for further information.

"Personal pronouns
2.66 Pronouns which refer to people are called personal^
pronouns. These can occur as heads of personal pronoun
phrases (see 2.75-81).
Personal pronouns reflect social relations between people far
more than do other parts of the language and a brief
discussion of their social role is required.
Only a limited number of words are purely pronominal. The
full forms of these are:
               first             second                third
    single saya, aku             engkau, kamu, ia, dia,
                                 kau, anda             beliau
    plural kita kami kalian                            mereka
               inci. excl.
The first singular forms both mean T but differ in social
distribution, as discussed below. The inclusive first plural kita
means 'we where the person being spoken to is included, that
          1is, T and you', while the exclusive first plural kami means 'we'
where the person being spoken to is excluded, that is, 'I and
others but not you . The second person pronouns are all
                    1restricted in social usage. However, the third person forms are
socially neutral except beliau 'he, she (respectful)'.
Pronouns aku 'I' and engkau, kau, kamu 'you singular' and
kalian 'you plural' (a recently created form not used by all
speakers) are intimate forms, used to children and between
equals who have a close relationship with each other. They
are sometimes used to younger adults, although this always
conveys a suggestion of social superiority on the part of the
speaker.
The pronouns saya T and anda 'you are often said to be
                                        1neutral in social connotation. This is largely true of saya,
although its use instead of aku usually indicates that an
intimate relationship does not exist. However, anda conveys
social information, as discussed below.
The pronouns kita 'we (inclusive)', kami 'we (exclusive)', ia,
dia 'he, she', and mereka 'they' are socially neutral. Of the
third person pronouns only beliau 'he, she' carries social
connotation, referring to people who are held in high respect.
It is among second person pronouns, those used for the
person being addressed, that most variety occurs.
Anda, an artificial creation introduced in the 1950s, was
intended as a neutral form, equivalent to English 'you'.
However, the mere fact that it does not convey the intimacy of
engkau, kau and kamu, nor indicate a kin relationship, meant
that it was immediately confined to impersonal situations,
such as addressing strangers of the same age as or younger
than the speaker. It is not widely used in addressing
individuals and, because it does not convey respect, cannot be
used by a junior to a senior. As an impersonal form it is most
frequently used in advertisements and public announcements,
and in addressing people in gatherings such as conferences.
The first example below is a notice in aeroplanes, while the
second is taken from an advertisement:
   Kenakan sabuk pengaman selama anda duduk.
   Fasten your safety belt while you are seated.
   Apakah mesin fotokopi anda mencemari lingkungan?
   Does your photocopier pollute the environment?
Pronoun substitutes
2.67 Pronoun substitutes are personal names and kinship
terms used instead of pronouns. Saudara 'sibling or relative
of the same generation', like anda, is used widely for 'you' to
people of the speaker's own generation or younger and has an
impersonal tone, generally being used towards people with
whom the speaker is not well acquainted. To females saudari
(see 1.42) is sometimes used.
The other pronoun substitutes can mean either T or 'you'.
Most common are bapak 'father' and ibu 'mother'. These are
respectful forms used to older people or to any adult of
marriagable age:
   Bapak tinggal di sini?
   Do you live here? (said to an older man)
   Apa ini anak ibu?
   Is this your child? (said to an older woman)
Like all pronoun substitutes, these terms are basically nouns,
used for referring to a third person. Thus the two sentences
above literally mean 'Does father live here?' and 'Is this
mother's child?' and can also be used in reference to a third
person, context making clear which is meant.
The abbreviated forms pak and bu cannot be used alone as
pronoun substitutes, that is, they cannot mean 'you', occurring
only as vocatives (see 4.109) in most people's usage.
However, in combination with a name they can be used as
terms for reference to a third person or in addressing a
second person, that is as pronoun substitutes:
   Pak Hasan mau makan sekarang?
   Do you want to eat now, Mr Hasan?
The above sentence could also be a question about a third
person, 'Does Mr Hasan want to eat now?'
Other abbreviated kinship terms can also combine with names
and be used in addressing another person: Mas Tomo 'older
brother Tomo', Mbak Yuli 'older sister Yuli', Dik Muji
'ypunger brother Muji'. There is a considerable amount of
regional variation in the use of such terms.
Tuan 'sir' and nyonya 'madam' (to a married woman) have a
much more limited role in modern Indonesian than in the
past but are still used by some people, especially to
foreigners. Like pak and ibu they can also be used with
personal names.
As pronoun substitutes bapak and ibu can also mean T. Here
they are restricted to use by older people to younger people,
whether their own children or not:
   Ibu mau ke pasar.
   I'm going to the market, (said by a woman to someone
   younger)
   Kasi pada bapak!
   Give it to me! (said by a man to a younger person)
Personal names are also commonly used as substitutes for T
and 'you'. This is particularly common among children, as a
substitute for aku and kamu:
   Dinah mau ikut.
   I want to come along, (said by a girl named Dinah)
   Ini untuk Dinah.
   This is for you. (said to a girl named Dinah)
2.68 When there is uncertainty about how a person should
be addressed Indonesians have a number of strategies for
avoiding giving offence. They may use a more polite form
than» is necessary, avoid using a pronoun altogether, or use
third person -nya. The last two possibilities are illustrated:
    Tinggal di mana?
    Where do (you) live?
    Di mana rumahnya?
    Where do you live? (literally: Where is his/her house?)
2.69 The above discussion of pronouns and pronoun
substitutes is far from exhaustive. Many other forms occur,
some confined to or identified with particular regional usage.
These include Jakartanese gua, gue T and lu 'you , and 1literary forms such as hamba T. Among some people o m
'uncle' and tante 'aunt' occur commonly as pronoun
substitutes for older people and opa 'grandfather' and oma
'grandmother' for people approximately of the same age as
the speaker's grandparents.
Among some people the distinction between kita and kami is
not always maintained. In some regional varieties kita is used
for 'I'.
Third person pronouns dia and ia
2.70 Third person singular ia and dia both mean 'he, she .      1Dia can occur in all positions. However, ia is restricted in
occurrence to pre-verbal position. That is, it can be used
instead of dia when it occurs before a verb, either as subject,
in either an active or passive sentence, or as agent in a type
two passive (see 3.28). In all other positions, including object
or agent following a verb, following a preposition, as
predicate and as a possessive, only dia can occur (although
-nya can occur instead in some of these positions - see 2.71):
   Dia/ia akan menolong kami.
   He will help us.
   makanan yang sudah dia/ia pesan
   the food he has ordered
   makanan yang sudah dipesan (oleh) dia
   the food which he has ordered
   Kami akan menolong dia.
   We will help her.
   Berikan buku ini kepada dia.
   Give this book to her.
   Ini buku dia.
   This is her book.
   Itu bukan dia.
   That isn't him.
The rule that ia cannot occur after the verb does not apply in
cases where as subject it follows the verb as a result of change
from standard word order (see 3.42):
   Melihat raksasa itu datang, bersembunyilah ia ke balik
   batu besar.
   Seeing the giant coming, he hid behind a large rock.
   (Standard word order: Ia bersembunyi...)
   Harus pergikah ia?
 - Must she go? (Standard word order: Ia harus pergi?)
Also ia can occur as object of the verb if it is also the subject
of a complement (see 3.76); in this case its role as subject of
the following complement takes precedence over its role as
object of the preceding verb. Dia and -nya can occur instead
of ia:
   Saya menganggapnya/dia/ia bodoh.
   I consider him stupid.
   Sikap inilah yang menyebabkan ia dijuluki ""nyinyir"".
   It was this trait which caused him to be nicknamed
   ""nagger"".
In older Malay dia was an inflected form of ia, occurring in
those positions in which only dia can occur in modern
Indonesian. First and second person equivalents daku T and
dikau 'you might still occasionally be seen in older literature
           1but are lost from the modern language:
   Suaranya yang merdu membenamkan daku ke satu
   fantasi yang indah dan ajaib.
   Her melodious voice enveloped me in a beautiful and
   mysterious fantasy.
Bound forms of pronouns
2.71 The singular pronouns aku, engkau and kamu, and
dia have bound variants in certain situations. The bound
forms are:
                prefixed            suffixed
   first        ku-                 -ku
   second       kau-                -mu
   third                            -nya
The suffixed forms occur as objects of active verbs:
  Narti menungguku/mu/nya.
  Narti is waiting for me/you/him.
The suffixed forms can only occur if the verb has prefix
meN-; hence they cannot occur with those transitive verbs
such as makan 'eat which do not have the prefix (see 1.186).
                   1In this case full pronouns aku, kamu and dia must be used or,
if a non-human is referred to, either the noun must be
repeated or ellipsis (see 4.113) occurs. The first sentence
below contains unprefixed makan 'eat\ while the second
contains the same verb with prefix meN-:
   Dia mengambil kue itu lalu makan.
   He took the cake and ate [it].
   Dia mengambil kue itu lalu memakannya.
   He took the cake and ate it.
Suffixed forms also cannot occur where meN- is dropped in
colloquial usage or in certain constructions such as
imperatives (see 4.39). Nor can they occur as complements.
Thus -nya can occur as object of mempelajari 'study':
mempelajarinya 'study it', but not as complement of belajar
'study' (see 3.63).
The third person suffixed form occurs as agent of a passhe
verb in passive type one (see 3.27):
   Narti ditunggunya.
   He is waiting for Narti.
The prefixed forms occur as agents of passive verbs in passive
type two (see 3.28). There is no third person form:
   Buku ini sudah kubaca.
   I have read this book.
   Buku ini sudah kaubaca.
   You have read this book.
Bound forms can occur as possessives:
  rumahku my house
  mobilmu your car
  bukunya her book
They also follow some prepositions. Most prepositions (see
2.118ff) can only be followed by full forms of the pronouns:
seperti aku 'like me', tentang kamu 'about you', kecuali dia
'except him', dari dia 'from her'. Some, like kepada 'to', allow
bound pronouns to follow: kepadaku 'to me', kepadamu 'to
you', kepadanya 'to him'. Other prepositions allowing
suffixed pronouns include: pada 'at, to', daripada 'than;
from', bagi 'for', buat 'for', untuk 'for', bersama 'together
with', dengan 'with', terhadap 'towards', oleh 'by', dari 'than'.
In all situations in which the bound forms can occur
corresponding free forms are also possible:
   Buku ini sudah aku/engkau baca.
   I/you have read this book.
   Ini pena aku/kamu/dia.
   This is my/your/his pen.
   Narti menunggu aku/kamu/dia.
   Narti is waiting for me/you/him.
Third person -nya can be plural, meaning 'they', as well as
singular (this is not the case with dia/ia):
   Mahasiswa-mahasiswa ini akan melanjutkan
   pendidikannya di luar negeri.
   These students will continue their education overseas.
   Mereka akan membuat rencana dan segala sesuatu akan
   diaturnya sesuai dengan rencana itu.
   They will make a plan and they will organise everything in
   accordance with that plan.
Pronouns indicating possession
2.72 Indicating possession pronouns must follow a noun;
phrasal forms corresponding to 'mine , 'his , and so on, do not
                                      1    1occur. This may require repetition of a noun:
   Mobil ini mobil saya.
   This car is mine.
To avoid repetition the first occurrence of the noun is usually
omitted. Alternatively the possessive pronoun may be
attached to a form like kepunyaan 'possession', milik
'property':
   Ini mobil saya.
   This is my car.
   Mobil ini kepunyaan saya.
   This car is mine (my possession).
As mentioned in section 2.71, singular pronouns can occur in
their free or bound (suffixed) form to mark possession.
Pronouns referring to non-humans
2.73 Most speakers use third person pronouns dia/ia and
mereka only to refer to humans. The bound form -nya can
refer to non-human animate and inanimate nouns, both single
and plural:
   Apa namanya?
   What's its name?/What are their names?
   Saya sudah membacanya.
   I've read it/them.
2.74 In contexts where -nya cannot occur there is usually
nothing corresponding to English 'it'. This is further
discussed in section 4.113. In the translations of the
following examples 'it' is placed in square brackets where
there is no equivalent in Indonesian:
   Hebat, bukan?
   [It's] amazing, isn't it?
   Dia meminyaki rambutnya, supaya mengkilat
   She oiled her hair so that [it] shone.
   Surat ini penting. Baca!
   This letter is important. Read [it]!
Despite the fact that it is unacceptable to many speakers, there
is an increasing tendency, especially in journalistic style, for
ia to mean 'it':
    ""Australia berada dalam situasi sulit bila ia kalah"",
    katanya.
    ""Australia will be in a difficult situation if it loses"", he said.
    Peliharalah taman ini. Ia milik anda.
   Look after this park. It is your property.
The use of mereka to refer to non-humans is rare but does
occur and is becoming increasingly common in journalistic
style. In the first example below it refers to horses:    2   Ia datangi dua ekor yang lain, membelai punggung
   mereka masing-masing...
   She approached two others, stroking the backs of each of
   them.
   Bakteri ternyata makhluk yang cukup cerdik. Mereka
   tak menyerang tubuh seenaknya, melainkan memilih
   sasaran tertentu.
   Bacteria are clearly cunning creatures. They do not attack
   the body randomly but choose specific targets.","[188, 189, 190, 191, 192, 193, 194, 195, 196]"

INTRODUCTION
This is a description of the Indonesian language for English-
speaking teachers and learners and for any others interested
in the language and its structures.
The work recognises that the majority of such people will not
be familiar with linguistic concepts and terminology.
Consequently it avoids linguistic jargon and theoretical
discussion. It also differs from linguistic studies in that it
does not always describe Indonesian grammar 'in its own
right'. The special needs of English learners of the language
are taken into account, with more detailed discussion of
structures which differ significantly from corresponding
structures in English. English and Indonesian structures are
specifically contrasted if the Indonesian structure is one which
causes particular difficulty for English-speaking learners.
The variety of Indonesian described here can be called
standard formal Indonesian. This can loosely be identified as
the language of government, administration and the mass
media in the Republic of Indonesia. It is the type of
Indonesian in which education takes place and which is used
by educated people in formal situations, whether written or
spoken. There is very little mention here of forms
characteristic only of colloquial and non-standard varieties of
Indonesian. Such varieties of the language vary considerably
from region to region, social group to social group and
according to the degree of informality of the situation.
Attempting to deal with what are in fact different grammatical
systems together in a single description would result in a
confusing hotchpotch and would divert attention from the
basic aim of this work, which is to provide a description of the
formal standard language. In some cases colloquial forms are
mentioned if they are widely used. However, this is rarely
done and phenomena such as the dropping of certain verbal
affixes in everyday speech are not discussed.
Even within formal standard Indonesian there is a
considerable amount of variation compared with that found in
standard English. Where there are alternative structures only
one might be acceptable to some educated people. Mention
of such differences is sometimes made. If published sources
give conflicting opinions as to the grammaticality of a
structure this is sometimes mentioned in a footnote. Much
variation, however, must go uncommented upon, including
the tendency of certain structures to be favoured by people of
particular regional language backgrounds.
Only rarely is comment made on the frequency of occurrence
of forms or on their level of formality (although forms
occurring mainly in colloquial styles are specifically
identified as such). Differences in usage between people of
different social and ethnic groups makes this a complex topic
in the study of the Indonesian language and comments are
necessarily very general.
Further, Indonesian is a language in a state of rapid change.
New words suddenly appear, some to acquire permanent
acceptance, others to quickly disappear. The mass media,
frequently translating from English, are constantly
introducing English words and structures. With the enormous
influence of the press on the language, structures regarded as
un-Indonesian or ungrammatical quite recently have become
acceptable (at least to some people) today. The Javanese
language too continues to influence Indonesian, both in
lexicon and syntax. The changes that have been occurring in
Indonesian present difficulties for any attempt to describe the
language. A grammar is basically a synchronic statement and
little attempt is made here to capture diachronic change,
although some important current trends are noted. Structures
which were common in earlier language may not be
mentioned here if they were not recorded in modern usage
during the preparation of this description.
In order to provide a practical reference for most user needs a
grammar must aim for a certain degree of completeness. The
present grammar describes in some detail all the major
structures of Indonesian from words to complex sentences.
However, it stops far short of attempting to describe the
various functions of individual words, this being the task of
dictionaries and studies of word usage (such as Sarumpaet
 1980). While contrasts between function words are frequently
pointed out, this is necessarily brief; Kaswanti Purwo's attempt
to investigate the differences in function between various
deictic words (Kaswanti Purwo 1984) reveals what an
enormous task this would be if extended to the entire lexicon.
In the production of this work I have drawn on many sources
for information on the language, exploiting the study and
insights of numerous people. All published works from
which information on Indonesian grammar have been taken
are given in the list of references. While major structures are
dealt with in some detail, as mentioned above, the description
is hampered by the fact that many areas of Indonesian
grammar have not been subjected to detailed analysis. Gaps
in our knowledge are found in all areas of the grammar, with
a great deal of analysis still being required on the affixes ter-
and ke-...-an, on reciprocal constructions, and on
complementation, to name but a very few areas. This
grammar then is only as complete as research on any area
allows.
An attempt is made to provide a reasonable number of varied
examples in natural contexts for all structures discussed.
Examples of constructions are drawn from numerous sources,
including newspapers, magazines and novels, television and
radio, and, to a lesser extent, from conversation. Others are
directly elicited from speakers of Indonesian. Where a
number of words function in the same way a list of examples
is usually provided. English glosses to words in such lists are
meant as a guide only. A gloss does not attempt to capture
the complexities of a word's meaning and refers only to its
meaning in the particular construction being discussed.
Where dictionaries disagree as the the meaning of a word, a
not uncommon occurrence, the tendency here is to follow
Kamus Besar Bahasa Indonesia (1991). Echols and Shadily's
dictionary (in the 1989 revision edited by John Wolff and
James Collins) has also been influential.
The work is in four chapters, each based on one of the four
basic levels of Indonesian grammar discussed: Words, Phrases,
Clauses, Sentences. No chapter is strictly confined to
describing elements at the level referred to in its title. In
particular, in dealing with the function of certain affixes, a
satisfactory description must take into account the syntactic
structures within which words taking those affixes occur. This
is especially true in the coverage of verbal affixes.
Because many structures must be referred to in several
sections cross-referencing is extensive. This attempts to help
the reader find desired information as quickly as possible,
something often very difficult in reference grammars. This is
also aided by a table of contents at the beginning of the work
and a more detailed index at the end.
Sections are numbered consecutively from the beginning to
the end of each chapter. As far as possible, each section has
been designed to be informative if read alone, thus providing
the reader with useful information on a particular small aspect
of the language.
A grammar is essentially a set of generalisations about a
language, each structure described being a general description
of a large number of utterances of a particular form. In order
for structures to be conveniently discussed labels must be
applied to them. These labels are called grammatical terms.
Grammatical terms used in this work are defined in the
section dealing with the structure they label. A glossary of
common terms is also provided. Terms used are basically the
common terms of traditional grammar, although some are
used here in a somewhat different way from what is usual in
grammars of English. Moreover, a few terms have been
coined here specifically to meet the needs of Indonesian
grammar. However, an effort is made to keep the the number
of grammar terms to a minimum.
Spelling used in this work is the official Ejaan yang
disempurnakan, introduced in 1972 (see, for instance,
Kridalaksana 1978). Punctuation is usually retained as it
occurred in written examples, although this results in some
inconsistency, mainly in the use of commas.
In this grammar the level of phonology is not dealt with.
Adequate non-technical descriptions of the sounds are given
in a number of teaching texts, such as Johns (1978). More
detailed discussion of phonology requires a level of technical
description not informative to people without a linguistics
training and for this reason is excluded. Works providing
such description include Alieva et al (1991), Macdonald
(1976), and Tata Bahasa Baku Bahasa Indonesiai 1988,
1993).
Levels of grammar above the sentence are not dealt with
either. Indonesian discourse structure still awaits adequate
analysis and, further, it is felt that a description of higher
levels would not be perceived by many users as having the
practical value of lower-level analysis. Nevertheless, a study
of Indonesian paragraph and discourse structure along the
lines of the present work would be a worthy project for a
future date.
Much about the Indonesian language apart from its grammar
could not be included in the present study. A brief discussion
of the history of the language and its position within present-
day Indonesian society can be found in the Introduction to
Worsley (1994).
In the production of this work a number of grammars of
English were consulted, including Quirk and Greenbaum
(1973) and Leech and Svartvik (1975). Collins Cobuild
English Grammar (1990) was especially valuable and has had
an important influence on the nature of this work.
1 WORDS
1.1       Words can be simple or complex. A simple word
consists solely of a base, which cannot be broken down into
smaller units. A base carries the essential meaning of a word
and is the part of the word listed alphabetically in a
dictionary. Examples of simple words are buku 'book , lebar
                                                        1'wide', duduk 'sit .
                 1
In this chapter are described the processes whereby complex
words are formed. A word can be complex in a number of
ways, it can consist of reduplicated bases, such as buku-buku
'books . Reduplication is discussed in sections 1.10 to 1.29.
      1It can be a compound of two bases, such as asal-usul 'origin'.
Compounds are discussed in paragraphs 1.30 to 1.35. A
word can also consist of a base with one or more affixes, such
as membukukan 'enter in a book , diperlebar 'widened ,
                                     1                        1kedudukan 'situation .
                     1
1.2     The description of affixes and their functions forms
the major part of this chapter, beginning at section 1.38.
There are three types of affix in Indonesian: prefixes, suffixes
and circumfixes. A prefix is attached before the base. When
a prefix is discussed separately it is indicated by a hyphen
after it, such as ber-. A suffix comes after a base, indicated
by hyphen before it: -an. A circumfix contains two parts, one
occurring before the base and one after. When a circumfix is
mentioned separately the two parts are separated by three
dots, this indicating the position of the base: ke-*..-an. When
only the first part of a circumfix is referred to, the term
'prefix is used. A fourth type of affix, the infix, is not part of
       1the system of modern Indonesian, although its earlier
occurrence is seen from a few fossilised forms, discussed in
sections 1.36-7. An infix is placed after the first consonant
sound of a base; when referred to separately an infix has
hyphens placed before and after it: -el-.","[4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36]"
"AFFIXES
1.38 In the following sections of this chapter the prefixes,
suffixes and circumfixes of the language are described.
When the function of an affix can be adequately described
without reference to context single words are given as
examples. When it is necessary to include a discussion of
context in the description of an affix examples are given in
context.
1.39 There are two types of affix according to function:
derivational and inflectional. When a derivational affix is
attached to a base it changes the word to another class; that is,
it derives another class. An inflectional affix does not change
the category of the word. Most affixes in Indonesian are
derivational. The important inflectional affixes are the voice
affixes meN- and di-, which are attached to transitive verbs to
signal whether they are active or passive.
1.40 Affixes can occur in combination. Thus the word
memperbesar 'enlarge' contains base besar 'large with       1prefixes meN- and per-.
A circumfix must be distinguished from a combination of
prefix and suffix. Thus berpakaian 'clothed, wearing clothes'
consists of prefix ber- 'have, wear' and base pakaian 'clothes'.
This in turn consists of base pakai 'wear' and'suffix -an. On
the other hand, berdatangan 'come in random fashion'
consists of circumfix ber-...-an 'do in random manner' and
base datang 'come'.
1.41 Most of the affixes described in the remainder of
this chapter are indigenous, while a few are borrowings from
other languages. A number of other affixes now occurring in
the language are not discussed here, such as -isme, as in
kolonialisme 'colonialism', and -itas, as in stabilitas 'stability'.
These are generally recent acquisitions from European
languages, attached to bases which are also borrowed from
European languages. While some are common in the speech
of educated people, they are not regarded as sufficiently
assimilated for inclusion here. However, commonly
occurring affixes borrowed from Sanskrit and Arabic are
included.
1.42 In a number of words borrowed from Sanskrit male
and female forms are distinguished, the former ending in a
and the latter in i. The distinction has been extended to a few
native words. The form with a is sometimes general, applying
both to males and females, while the form with i is always
feminine. This ending is not a suffix as the word cannot
occur without it:
   dewa god, deity : dewi goddess
   pemuda youth : pemudi young female
   pramugara air steward : pramugari air stewardess
   putra son; prince : putri daughter; princess
   saudara relative of same generation; you : saudari you
      (to female)
The only affixes which make a gender distinction are -wan
and -wati (see 1.105).
1.43 In the following discussion affixes are grouped
according to the class of word they derive. The 'parts of
speech' referred to, noun, verb and so on, are described in
Chapter Two. When discussing the meaning of affixes it is
sometimes convenient to use the symbol [base] to indicate
that the meaning of any relevant base can occur in that
position. Thus, in section 1.59 the meaning of -an is
described as apa yang di-[base]. With the base makan this
becomes apa yang dimakan.
Derivation of nouns
1.44 A considerable number of affixes can be attached to
bases to derive nouns. Nouns are further discussed in section
2.3.
Prefix peN-
1.45 This prefix is attached to verbs and some other
words to derive nouns with several closely related meanings.
With some bases peN- alternates with pe-, as discussed in
section 1.53.
1.46 PeN- is attached to verbal bases to derive nouns
indicating a person who carries out the action expressed by
the base. Corresponding verbs are given for comparison in
the following examples:
   menganut follow : penganut follower, adherent
   menonton view : penonton spectator
   menulis write : penulis writer
   menumpang ride in : penumpang passenger
   menduduki occupy : penduduk inhabitant
1.47 peN- also derives nouns referring to inanimate
objects, usually the instrument with which the action is
performed. Such forms frequently modify another noun (see
2.37) or are themselves modified by another noun, as shown
in the following examples:
    membangkitkan generate : pembangkit (listrik)
       (electricity) generator
   mempersatukan unify : pemersatu unifier
    mencetak print : (mesin) pencetak printer
   menenangkan calm : (obat) penenang sedative
   mengendalikan control : (menara) pengendali control
       (tower)
   menggaris draw a line : penggaris ruler
   menutup shut : penutup (botol) (bottle) top
   merangsang stimulate : perangsang stimulant
1.48 A peN- noun can sometimes mean either a person
who performs the action or an instrument with which the
action is performed, depending on context:
   mencetak print : pencetak printer (person or instrument)
   mendengarkan listen : pendengar listener; (alat)
      pendengar hearing aid
   menjebak trap, snare : penjebak trapper; trap
1.49 A few peN- nouns are based not on verbs but on
other parts of speech, usually adjectives. These refer to
someone or something associated with the base:
   besar big : pembesar important person
   jahat bad : penjahat criminal
   mabuk intoxicated : pemabuk drunk (person)
   muda young : pemuda youth
   sakit sick : penyakit illness
   sebab cause : penyebab cause
A number of other forms based on adjectives, such as pemalu
'shy person , are often interpreted as nouns but bear more
           1resemblance to adjectives. These are described in sections
1.119-22.
prefix pe-
1.50 This prefix derives nouns indicating a person who
carries out an action. It occurs with a limited number of
bases.
1.51 Pe- derives nouns indicating a person who carries
out the action indicated by the corresponding ber- verb. It
only occurs with bases which begin with a consonant:
   bekerja work : pekerja worker
   berdagang trade : pedagang trader, merchant
   berjalan walk : pejalan (kaki) pedestrian
   berziarah go on pilgrimage : peziarah pilgrim
1.52 Pe- nouns sometimes refer to sporting activities.
Some of these have no corresponding ber- verbs:
   berenang swim : perenang swimmer
   bergulat wrestle : pegulat wrestler
   bertinju box : petinju boxer
   bulu tangkis badminton : pebulu tangkis badminton
      player
   tenis tennis : petenis tennis player
1.53 In a few cases both peN- and pe- nouns occur with
the same base, having the same or very similar meanings:
   bersaing, menyaingi compete : pesaing, penyaing
      competitor
   bersulap, menyulap conjure : pesulap, penyulap
      conjurer
   cinta, mencintai love : pecinta, pencinta lover
1.54 PeN- and pe- may both occur but with different
meaning. Sometimes peN- indicates one who performs the
action (the actor), being related to a verb with prefix meN-,
while pe- indicates one who undergoes the action (the patient
- see 3.17), being related to a verb with prefix di-:
   penatar trainer (menatar run upgrading course) :
      petatar trainee (ditatar be upgraded, trained)
   penunjuk indicator (menunjukkan indicate) : petunjuk
      instructions, indication (ditunjukkan indicated)
   penyuruh one who gives orders (menyuruh order) :
     pesuruh messenger, one who takes orders (disuruh
     ordered)
In a few cases both forms occur with different meanings
which are not related to actor and patient:
   penjabat (menteri) acting (minister) : pejabat official
      (menjabat hold office)
   penyerta companion (menyertai accompany) : peserta
     participant (ikut serta participate)
1.55 With some bases N is lost from peN- (see 1.5). With
such bases the prefix can only be determined by the
corresponding verb. Thus pelukis 'painter' has prefix peN-,
corresponding to melukis 'paint', while pelari 'runner' has
prefix pe-, relating to berlari 'run'. The prefix in pelatih
'trainer, coach' is peN- as the word relates to melatih 'train
(someone)', not to berlatih 'train, practice'.
Prefix per-
1.56 There are a very few nouns with prefix per-. Several
of these have bases with an initial vowel and these could be
regarded as having a variant of prefix pe-:
   pelajar student (belajar study)
   perantara intermediary, go-between (berantara be
      spaced)
   pe(r)tanda sign, indication
   pertapa hermit, ascetic (bertapa live as an ascetic)
In several cases there is contrast with peN-, thus pelajar
'student' and pengajar 'instructor, teacher' (mengajar teach).
Suffix -an
1:57 Suffix -an derives nouns from verbs and, to a lesser
extent, from nouns, adjectives and other classes. It also co-
occurs with full and partial reduplication. It has a number of
different functions.
1.58 Suffix -an most commonly attaches to verb bases,
several different meanings being distinguishable.
1.59       With many verb bases it produces a noun which
stands as object (see 3.19) of the action indicated by the verb.
There is therefore always an associated transitive verb. The
meaning is often expressed in Indonesian as apa yang di-
[base] 'what is [base]-ed\ where [base] is the meaning of the
verb base. Thus makanan 'food is apa yang dimakan 'what
                                 1is eaten', pakaian 'clothes' is apa yang dipakai 'what is worn'.
This is a large, productive set of nouns, including:
   lukisan picture                  minuman drink
  tulisan writing                   kenalan acquaintance
   ukiran carving                   pinjaman loan
  sumbangan contribution            pilihan choice
  tanaman plant                     tujuan destination
1.60 While these nouns all relate to the object of the
corresponding verb, further subgrouping on semantic
grounds is possible. Thus some refer to something which
results from the action, such as tulisan 'writing' and ukiran
'carving', while others refer to something already existing
which is subjected to the action, such as makanan 'food' and
minuman 'drink'.
1.61 One subset of nouns in this group typically act as
modifiers to another noun (see 2.37), although some can
occur alone with the same meaning. They tend to be
translated by adjectives in English:
   (barang) curian stolen (goods)
   (binatang) buruan game (animal)
   (budak) belian bought (slave)
   (rumah) sewaan rented (house)
   (sapi) perahan milch (cow)
1.62 The second important group of -an nouns with verb
bases are action nouns (see 2.53). These describe the action
of the verb and can occur as head of a phrase containing
prepositions such as terhadap. Thus serangan 'attack', as in
the noun phrase serangan terhadap musuh 'an attack on the
enemy , expresses the same action as the verb menyerang
       1'attack', as in the construction Mereka menyerang musuh
'They attacked the enemy . This is also a large, productive set
                          1of nouns and includes:
   ancaman threat                tentangan challenge
   balasan response              kecaman criticism
   bantuan help                  tuntutan demand
   keluhan complaint             tekanan pressure
   larangan prohibition          tembakan shooting
1.63 With some verb bases -an derives nouns indicating
the instrument with which the action is performed or the place
where the action occurs. With some nouns the instrumental or
locative meaning is clear while for others either interpretation
is possible. Thus timbangan 'scales' can be interpreted as
either the instrument with which one weighs (menimbang
'weigh') or the place where weighing takes place:
   ayunan cradle                  gilingan mill
   kendaraan vehicle              bendungan dam
   saluran channel                parkiran parking place
   angkutan transport             pikulan carrying pole
   boncengan pillion, bicycle rack
   gantungan hanger (for clothes)
1.64 -an can also occur with noun bases. Sometimes it
has the same meaning as the base, or a meaning which varies
only slightly from that of the base, such as peran, peranan
'role , while with other words there is a clear difference in
    1meaning. It may indicate a magnification of the base, thus
laut 'sea , lautan 'ocean'. It may have the same meaning as the
        1base but with an additional extension of that meaning, thus
pinggir 'edge', pinggiran 'edge, outskirts'. In some cases the
difference in meaning is unpredictable, such as akhir 'end',
akhiran 'suffix':
    darat (dry) land : daratan mainland
 ' gambar picture : gambaran description
    keluh sigh, groan : keluhan groan, complaint
    pasar market : pasaran (international) market
    ruang space, room : ruangan space, (large) room
    kubang, kubangan mudhole
    landas, landasan base, substratum
    gugus, gugusan group, cluster
1.65 One group of -an nouns based on nouns derive
words which do not differ in meaning from the base but have
a different distribution. The base alone typically occurs as a
partitive (see 2.29) indicating a natural or artificial grouping
or piece of something, and is always preceded by a number,
most commonly se- 'one . The -an form occurs as the head
                          1of a noun phrase and can have a noun modifier (see 2.37).
Typically both constructions have the same translation in
English:
   sederet rumah
   deretan rumah
   a row of houses
   Dia membawa seikat jerami/Dia membawa ikatan
   jerami*
   He was carrying a bundle of hay.
While the base usually occurs in a partitive construction with a
preceding number, and is thus always indefinite, the -an form
can be specific, occurring without a number, either alone or
with a determiner:
   deretan itu that row
   ikatan ini this bundle
The following examples give only the -an form, but the base
also has the same translation:
   gugusan group, cluster      lembaran sheet, page
   jajaran row, line           pasangan pair
   kawanan herd, flock         rangkaian series
   kepingan chip, fragment     timbunan heap, pile
1.66 Suffix -an can occur with a reduplicated noun base.
There are two major functions.
1.67 The word can indicate a variety of what is indicated
by the base. This formation is especially common with words
for plants:
   obat-obatan medicines
   pohon-pohonan (all kinds of) trees
   padi-padian cereals
   bunga-bungaan (all kinds of) flowers
   daun-daunan foliage
   rumput-rumputan grasses, weeds
   sayur-sayuran vegetables
   umbi-umbian (various) edible tubers
   buah-buahan fruits
   tari-tarian (various kinds of) dances
1.68 The word can indicate a diminutive or something
which resembles or imitates what the base specifies. With this
function the construction is quite productive and people often
create new forms to refer to toys:
   mobil-mobilan toy car
   rumah-rumahan doll's house
   bulan-bulanan target
   kuda-kudaan toy horse, hobbyhorse
   kapal-kapalan toy boat
   perang-perangan manoeuvres
   burung-burungan toy bird
   orang-orangan puppet; scarecrow
1.69 A few of the forms described in 1.67 with full
reduplication of the base can alternatively occur with partial
reduplication:
   pepohonan trees
   rerumputan weeds
   dedaunan foliage, greenery
1.70 A few forms, with either full or partial reduplication,
have verbal bases:
   reruntuhan ruins (runtuh collapse)
   tumbuh-tumbuhan, tetumbuhan (all sorts of) plants
      (tumbuh grow)
   goreng-gorengan fried foods (goreng fry)
   sesajian (temple) offerings (saji offer)
1.71 With adjective bases -an derives nouns which refer to
something having the characteristic specified by the base:
   asam sour : asaman pickles
   kotor dirty : kotoran excrement, garbage
   lanjut advanced : lanjutan continuation
   manis sweet : manisan sweets
   samar indistinct, vague : samaran camouflage, disguise
Circumfix ke-...-an
1.72 Circumfix ke-...-an forms nouns from adjectives,
verbs and other classes. Such nouns are generally of an
abstract nature.
1.73 Ke-...-an nouns can have an adjective base. The
nouns are all abstract, identifying the characteristic of the
adjective:
   baik good : kebaikan goodness, kindness
   bebas free : kebebasan freedom
   bersih clean : kebersihan cleanliness
   cantik beautiful : kecantikan beauty
   sehat healthy : kesehatan health
   sulit difficult : kesulitan difficulty
1.74 In general the meaning of the noun can be predicted
from the meaning of the adjective base. In a few cases this is
not so:
   berat heavy : keberatan objection
   malu shy : kemaluan genitals
   terang clear : keterangan explanation
1.75 The negative tidak 'not' can combine with some
adjectives to form a compound base for ke-...-an nouns.
These correspond to English nouns with prefix dis- or in-:
   adil just : ketidak-adilan injustice
   jujur honest : ketidak-jujuran dishonesty
   puas satisfied : ketidak-puasan dissatisfaction
   senang pleased : ketidak-senangan displeasure
1.76 Several adjectives derived with prefix se- (see 1.127)
can form the base of a ke-...-an noun:
   seimbang balanced : keseimbangan balance, equilibrium
   sesuai appropriate, suitable : kesesuaian suitability,
      compatibility
   seragam uniform, of the same kind : keseragaman
      uniformity
1.77 The noun can be formed from an intransitive verb:
   datang come : kedatangan arrival
   hidup live : kehidupan life
  ingin wish : keinginan wish, desire
  lahir be born : kelahiran birth
  menang win : kemenangan victory
  naik go up : kenaikan rise, increase
1.78 The base can be a verb with prefix ber- or ter-. In
this case the prefix remains:
    berangkat depart : keberangkatan departure
    berhasil succeed : keberhasilan success
    terbatas limited : keterbatasan limitation
   tersedia available : ketersediaan availability
1.79 A few nouns are formed from a negated verb or
have a compound verb base:
   tahu know : ketidak-tahuan ignorance
   ikut serta participate : keikut-sertaan participation
1.80 A few ke-.„-an nouns are based on modals (see
2J 53) or adverbs:
   boleh may : kebolehan ability, skill
   harus must : keharusan necessity, a must
   kerap frequently : kekerapan frequency
   lebih more : kelebihan excess
   mungkin possible : kemungkinan possibility
1.81 ke-...-an nouns can be based on nouns; this use is
very productive and many forms are recent in the language.
The ke-...-an forms in general mean 'having to do with
[base]'. Some forms have a different translation from the
base:
   anggota member : keanggotaan membership
   daerah region : kedaerahan regionalism
   ibu mother : keibuan motherliness
   pemimpin leader : kepemimpinan leadership
   wanita woman : kewanitaan femininity
1.82 Many ke-...-an nouns with noun bases typically
modify another noun. Thus keagamaan 'having to do with
religion' occurs in such phrases as upacara keagamaan
'religious ceremony'. Sometimes the translation depends on
context; thus kebangsaan is translated differently in the
phrases kebangsaan kapal itu 'nationality of the ship' and
lagu kebangsaan 'national song'. When modifying another
noun it is frequently translated by an adjective, as in the case
of keagamaan above. In other cases the ke-...-an noun has
the same translation as the base. Thus penduduk 'population'
and (teori) kependudukan 'population (theory)'. In either
case such nouns are best glossed 'having to do with [base]',
except where context makes their meaning clear, as in the
following examples:
   kedokteran medical, having to do with doctors : fakultas
      kedokteran faculty of medicine
   kehutanan forestry, having to do with forests : petugas
      kehutanan forestry official
   kepolisian having to do with police : akademi kepolisian
      police academy
   keuangan finance, finances : departemen keuangan
      department of finance; soal keuangan financial matters
   kemasyarakatan social, having to do with society or
      community : masalah kemasyarakatan community
      problem
   kemahasiswaan having to do with students : hidup
      kemahasiswaan student life
   keimigrasian having to do with immigration : undang-
      undang keimigrasian immigration laws
1.83 In a few cases ke-...-an nouns are formed from
nouns already having prefix peN-, such as kependudukan
'having to do with population' (penduduk population
menduduki occupy) and kepemimpinan leadership
(pemimpin leader, pimpin lead).
1.84 With noun bases indicating a person holding a rank
or office, ke-...-an forms nouns meaning 'the domain
administered by [base]':
   duta ambassador : kedutaan embassy
   kaiser emperor : kekaisaran empire
   lurah village head : kelurahan administrative unit headed
      by a lurah
   menteri minister : kementerian department headed by a
      minister
   raja king : kerajaan kingdom
   sultan sultan : kesultanan sultanate
1.85 With a very few noun bases ke-...-an forms nouns
indicating a collection of [base]:
   pulau island : kepulauan archipelago
   pustaka book (archaic) : kepustakaan bibliography, list
      of references
1.86 A few nouns are derived from numbers, both
definite and indefinite (see 2.106ff), meaning 'a group which
consists of [base] :
                 1   satu one : kesatuan unit
   sebelas eleven : kesebelasan eleven (soccer team)
   seluruh whole : keseluruhan entirety
Circumfix peN~...-an
1.87 Most nouns with peN-...-an have verbal bases. They
refer to the action expressed by the corresponding transitive
verb and are often translatable 'the act of doing what the verb
refers to'. They can occur with an indication of length of
time or with such verbs as dilakukan 'carried out'. In the first
example below penulisan 'the act of writing, the writing'
relates to menulis 'write'; in the second pengumpulkan 'the act
of collecting' relates to mengumpulkan 'collect', and so on:
   Penulisan buku itu memerlukan dua tahun.
   The writing of that book took two years.
   Pengumpulan cerita-cerita itu dilakukan di New York.
   The collecting of these stories was done in New York.
   Amerika Serikat telah menghentikan pengiriman bahan
   makanan.
   The USA has stopped the sending of foodstuffs.
   Kedua kepala negara menyaksikan penandatanganan
   perjanjian kerja sama.
   The two heads of state witnessed the signing of the
   cooperation agreement.
In the above examples the peN-...-an nouns are all translated
by '-ing' verbs. Some peN-...-an nouns, however, usually
correspond to English nouns which also translate
corresponding -an nouns (see 1.59). Thus, while
penerjemahan can be translated 'the translating', it is more
common for 'translation to occur in English, which also
                          1translates terjemahan. On the other hand, some -an nouns
are translated with '-ing' verbs; thus tulisan and penulisan
both translate 'writing . However, the meanings of the two are
                      1always distinct, the peN-...-an noun referring to the action, the
-an noun referring to the result of the action. This is further
discussed in section 1.116.
This is a productive affixation and applies very freely to
transitive verbs:
   pelaksanaan implementation, implementing
   pembacaan reading
   pencetakan printing
   penembakan shooting
   pengecekan checking (of facts)
   pengiriman dispatch(ing), sending
   pengusiran expulsion, expelling
   penjualan selling
1.88 Where meN- cooccurs with prefixes per- (see
1.234ff) and ber- (see 1.199), so too can peN-„.-an. If meN-
also occurs without those affixes contrasting peN-...-an nouns
sometimes also occur. Preceded by peN- the initial p of per-
is lost (see 1.6):
    memberlakukan apply (rules) : pemberlakuan
       application (of rules)
    memperoleh get, acquire : pemerolehan process of
       acquiring
    memberhentikan dismiss : pemberhentian dismissal, cf.
       menghentikan stop : penghentian stopping, cessation
    mempersatukan unite : pemersatuan unification, cf.
       menyatukan unite : penyatuan unification
1.89 Nouns derived with peN-...-an can also correspond
to intransitive verbs with prefix meN- (see 1.179). If there is
an intransitive meN- verb and a transitive verb having the
same base there may be peN-..»-an nouns corresponding to
each of them. Thus penyerahan '(act of) surrendering, the
surrender' corresponds both to intransitive menyerah
'surrender, give in' and transitive menyerahkan 'surrender,
hand over, transfer':
   Penyerahaan tentara Jepang terjadi bulan Agustus.
   The surrender of the Japanese army occurred in August.
   Penyerahaan surat-surat itu dituntut oleh jaksa.
   The handing over of the documents was demanded by the
   prosecutor.
Other examples of peN-...-an nouns relating to both transitive
and intransitive verbs are:
   pendaratan landing : mendarat land (intr.),
      mendaratkan land (trans.)
   pendaftaran registration : mendaftar register (intr.),
      mendaftarkan register (trans.)
1.90 If two transitive verbs have the same base then a
peN-...-an noun may correspond to only one of them:
   penemuan discovery : menemukan discover, cf.
     menemui meet
   pembangunan development : membangun develop, cf.
     membangunkan wake up
On the other hand, there may be a peN-...-an noun
corresponding to each of the verbs:
   menerangi light, illuminate : penerangan lighting,
      illumination; menerangkan explain : penerangan
      explanation
   menembak shoot (someone) : penembakan shooting (of
      someone); menembakkan fire (a bullet) :
      penembakan firing (of a bullet)
1.91 In some cases a peN-...-an noun corresponds to the
object of an action as well as, or instead of, corresponding to
the act. Thus penemuan means 'discovery' in the sense of
'something discovered' as well as 'the act of discovering'.
Some nouns, like pengetahuan 'knowledge (what is known)'
and peninggalan 'remains; inheritance (what is left behind)'
relate only to the object of the verb. Other nouns which relate
to the object of the corresponding verb include:
   memandang view, observe : pemandangan view, scenery
   mengumumkan announce : pengumuman
       announcement
1.92 A number of peN-..-an nouns refer to the place
where the action of the corresponding verb typically occurs.
They usually also relate to the action:
   menggiling mill : penggilingan mill (place); act of
     milling
   mencuci wash : pencucian laundry; act of washing
   membuang exile : pembuangan place of exile; act of
     exiling
   membakar burn : pembakaran place for burning; act of
     burning
   menginap spend the night : penginapan lodging, inn
Circumfix per-...-an
1.93 Many nouns with this affixation relate to verbs with
prefix ber-. They indicate the process or result of the action
referred to by the corresponding verb:
   bekerja work : pekerjaan work
   belajar study : pelajaran lesson
   bergerak move : pergerakan movement
   berjanji promise : perjanjian promise, agreement
   bersatu unite : persatuan unity
   bertemu meet : pertemuan meeting
1.94 Some per-...-an nouns correspond to transitive
verbs, indicating the act of doing what the verb indicates:
   menolong help : pertolongan help, assistance
   mengingatkan warn, remind : peringatan warning
   mencoba try : percobaan experiment; attempt
   memohon request : permohonan request
   mengatur put in order : peraturan regulation
   melawan oppose : perlawanan opposition
1.95 Some per-...-an nouns refer to the place where the
action of the corresponding verb occurs:
   berhenti stop : perhentian stopping place
   berjudi gamble : perjudian place for gambling
   mencetak print : percetakan printery
   menenun weave : pertenunan textile mill
1.96 Verbs with prefix per- (see 1.234ff) always have
associated nouns with per-...-an, never with -an (see 1.57ff).
While such nouns are listed here as having circumfix per-...
-an, an alternative interpretation would be to treat them as
retaining verbal prefix per- on the base to which suffix -an is
then attached:
   memperbaiki repair, improve : perbaikan repairs,
       improvement
   memperhatikan pay attention to : perhatian attention
   memperhitungkan calculate : perhitungan calculation
   mempertimbangkan consider : pertimbangan
       consideration
1.97 Per-...-an nouns with noun bases may indicate
'having to do with [base], affairs dealing with [base]':
   budak slave : perbudakan slavery
   musuh enemy : permusuhan enmity, hostility
   saudara brother : persaudaraan brotherhood, friendship
   sekutu ally : persekutuan alliance
   undang-undang law : perundang-undangan legislation
   wakil deputy, representative : perwakilan representation,
      delegation
1.98 As is the case with abstract ke-...-an nouns (1,81-2),
many of these forms based on nouns occur attributive to
other nouns. While they literally mean 'having to do with
[base]', they are usually translated by the same word as the
base. The following examples occur as modifiers to other
nouns:
   buruh worker : (sengketa) perburuhan labour (dispute)
   ekonomi economy : (masalah) perekonomian economic
      (matter)
   film movie : (dunia) perfilman movie (world)
   hotel hotel : (bidang) perhotelan hotel (sector)
   industri industry : (daerah) perindustrian industrial
      (region)
   kabar news : (media) perkabaran news (media)
   kayu timber : (buruh) perkayuan timber (worker)
   rumah house : (kompleks) perumahan housing
      (complex)
1.99 Some per-...-an nouns with noun bases indicate 'a
collection of [base]' or 'the place where a large number of
[base] are found':
   air water : perairan waters
   alat instrument : peralatan equipment
   bukit hill : perbukitan hilly region
   gelang bracelet : pergelangan ankle/wrist
   istilah term : peristilahan terminology
   pustaka book (archaic) : perpustakaan library
1.100 Some per-...-an nouns mean both 'affairs to do with
[base]' (see 1.98) and 'place where a large number of [base]
are found/collection of [base]' (1.99):
   ikan fish : perikanan fishery affairs; fishery
   kebun garden : perkebunan horticulture; plantation
   kota town : perkotaan urban affairs; urban area
   sawah rice field : persawahan rice cultivation; cluster of
      rice fields
   ternak livestock : peternakan animal husbandry; animal
      farm
   toko shop : pertokoan shopping matters; shopping area
The different meanings are made clear in context:
  Dia ingin mendapat pekerjaan di peternakan ayam.
  She wants to get a job on a chicken farm.
  Dia ingin mendapat pekerjaan di bidang peternakan.
  She wants to get a job in animal husbandry.
  Ayahnya mengurus perkebunan teh.
  Her father manages a tea plantation.
  Ayahnya pejabat di jawatan perkebunan.
  Her father is an official in the horticulture office.
1.101 Some per-...-an nouns with noun bases have a
meaning the same as or very similar to that of the base:
   batas limit; border : perbatasan border
   debat debate : perdebatan debate
   masalah matter, problem : permasalahan matter,
      problem
   muka face; surface : permukaan surface
   serikat union : perserikatan union
   soal matter, problem : persoalan matter, problem
   syarat condition, regulation : persyaratan regulations
1.102 With cardinal numbers per-...-an forms nouns
referring to road intersections. Only the following occur:
   tiga three : pertigaan three-way intersection
   empat four : perempatan cross-roads
   lima five : perlimaan five-way intersection
Circumfix pe-...-an
1.103 The number of nouns with this affix is limited. It
occurs unpredictably with some bases instead of per-*..-an.
(In contexts where the r of per- is regularly lost, as in
peternakan 'animal farm' (see 1.4), per-...-an is recognised as
occurring.) Most pe-...-an nouns are based on nouns and
indicate 'the place where a large number of [base] occur'. A
few also mean 'affairs to do with [base]'. Several have bases
which are not nouns:
   dalam inside : pedalaman interior, inland
   desa village : pedesaan rural; rural area
   gunung mountain : pegunungan mountain range
   jagal butcher : pejagalan abattoir
   bertualang undertake adventure : petualangan adventure
   menggadaikan pawn : pegadaian pawn shop
1.104 With some bases both per-...-an and pe-...-an occur,
with the same meaning. Some speakers use only one or the
other:
   bermukim reside : permukiman, pemukiman settlement
   dupa incense : perdupaan, pedupaan censer, incense
       burner
   kubur grave : perkuburan, pekuburan cemetery
   sawah rice field : persawahan, pesawahan rice
       cultivation; cluster of rice fields
Suffixes -wan, -wati and -man
1.105 The suffix -wan occurs with bases, most of which are
nouns, to indicate a person who is regularly associated with
[base].
   harta wealth, property : hartawan wealthy person
   ilmu science : ilmuwan scientist
   olahraga sport : olahragawan sportsman/woman
   rohani spiritual : rohaniwan clergyman
   sastra literature : sastrawan man of letters
   sejarah history : sejara(h)wan historian
   warta news : wartawan journalist
1.106 Suffixes -wan and -wati, both borrowed from
Sanskrit, are the only affixes in the language which make a
gender distinction (see also 1.42). The form -wan refers to
both male and female unless it is contrasted with -wati, which
is specifically feminine:
    karya work : karyawati female worker
    seni art : seniwati female artist
    sukarela voluntary : sukarelawati female volunteer
    wisuda graduation : wisudawati graduating female
1.107 The suffix -man derives one noun:
   seni art : seniman artist
Suffixes -anda, -nda
1.108 These are added to a number of pronouns and kin
terms to form honorifics, that is, forms of address which show
respect. Suffix -anda is added to bases ending in a consonant
and -nda to bases ending in a vowel. In most cases a base
loses final k, resulting in a final vowel, which is then followed
by -nda:
   anak : anakanda child
   kakak : kakanda older sibling
   ayah : ayahanda father
   nenek : nenenda grandmother
   ibu : ibunda mother
   adik : adinda younger sibling
The word ayunda 'older sister (honorific) is a borrowing
                                               1from Javanese and has no base in Indonesian.
Prefix ke-
1.109 This is added to a few bases to form nouns:
   hendak want : kehendak desire
   kasih love : kekasih beloved
   rangka framework, skeleton : kerangka skeleton
   tua old : ketua chairman
Prefix ter-
1*110 This prefix occurs with a small group of nouns used
in legal proceedings, such as terdakwa 'accused person':
    Satu demi satu para terdakwa dijatuhi hukuman
   penjara.
    One by one the accused were sentenced to jail.
These forms also occur as verbs (see 1.265); as nouns the
following occur:
   tergugat the accused
   terhukum person who has been sentenced
   terpidana convicted person
   tersangka the suspect
   tertuduh the accused
Prefix pra-
1.111 Prefix pra- 'pre-' is a borrowing from Sanskrit:
   prasejarah prehistory (sejarah history)
   prasangka prejudice (sangka supposition)
   prakata foreword (kata word)
   prasyarat precondition (syarat condition)
Comparison of noun-forming affixes
1.112 While generalisations can be made about the
functions of all noun-forming affixes, there are always
exceptions, words which can only be placed in a category with
difficulty or not at all. Many irregularities and minor
functions of affixes are not considered in the above sections.
1.113 Further, there is not always a clear-cut distinction
between the functions of two affixes. The result is that a
particular base might take two affixes with little or no
difference in meaning. Thus, while peN- usually occurs with
verb bases (1.45) and -wan with noun bases (1.105), there are
a few bases which allow both affixes to occur, with the same
meaning:
   pirsa : pemirsa, pirsawan television viewer
   usaha : pengusaha, usahawan business person
1.114 In some cases a word is derived with one of two
affixes, the choice being unpredictable for a particular base,
as seen from the following pair:
   menolong help : pertolongan help, assistance
   membantu help : bantuan help, assistance
1.115 Sometimes the difference in meaning between two
derived forms depends on whether the form relates directly to
the meaning of the base or to the meaning of another derived
form. This is the case with the pair ke-...-an and peN-...-an.
The meaning of the former relates immediately to the
meaning of the adjective base (see 1.73), while the meaning
of the latter relates to the meaning of the corresponding
transitive verb (1.87). Thus:
   bersih clean : kebersihan cleanliness; membersihkan
       make clean : pembersihan (act of) cleansing
   bebas free : kebebasan freedom; membebaskan release,
       liberate : pembebasan (act of) liberating
1.116 Affixes -an and peN-...-an frequently have the same
verbal base. In such cases the meaning of -an usually relates
to the object of the action, (apa yang di-[base] - see 1.59),
while peN-...-an relates to the action itself (see 1.187):
   menerjemahkan translate : terjemahan translation;
      penerjemahan act of translating
   menabung save : tabungan savings (money which is
      saved); penabungan act of saving (the saving of
      money)
   menulis write : tulisan writing (something which is
      written); penulisan writing (the act of writing
      something)
   memilih choose : pilihan choice, selection (something
      chosen or selected); pemilihan act of choosing,
      selecting
   Terjemahan ini tepat sekali.
   This translation is very accurate.
   Penerjemahan buku itu dilakukan tahun lalu.
   The translation/translating of that book was undertaken last
   year.
1.117 Where per-...-an and peN-...-an nouns have the
same base the former usually relates to a ber- intransitive verb
while the latter relates to a meN- transitive verb. Thus
perkembangan 'development' relates to intransitive
berkembang 'develop, expand': perkembangan bahasa
Indonesia 'the development of Indonesian' relates to Bahasa
Indonesia berkembang 'Indonesian develops', while
pengembangan 'development, the developing (of something)'
relates to mengembangkan 'develop, build': pengembangan
bahasa Indonesia 'the development of Indonesian' relates to
(Mereka) mengembangkan bahasa Indonesia '(They)
develop Indonesian'. Other examples are:
   perbuatan action, act : berbuat do; pembuatan (the act
       of) making : membuat make
   perkumpulan association : berkumpul gather;
       pengumpulan collecting : mengumpulkan collect
Derivation of adjectives
1.118 The majority of adjectives consist of free bases, as
discussed in section 2.98. A limited number of adjectives are
derived forms.
Prefix peN-
1.119 Prefix peN- usually occurs with verb bases to derive
nouns indicating one who carries out the action described by
the base (see 1.46). It also occurs with adjective bases
indicating human characteristics. These words are usually
translated by nouns indicating one who is regularly identified
with the characteristic:
   diam quiet : pendiam quiet person
   malas lazy : pemalas lazy person
   malu shy : pemalu shy person
   marah angry : pemarah hot head
   riang cheerful : periang cheerful person
1.120 While these words are translated by nouns they
actually behave more like adjectives. Thus they can be
coordinated with adjectives:
   Kakak saya seorang yang tenang dan pendiam.
   My older sister is a calm and quiet person.
They are negated by tidak, not bukan:
  Dia tidak pemarah.
  He's not hot-tempered.
They can follow yang, which is common with adjectives but
rare with nouns (see 3.101):
   Dia bukan orang yang pemalu.
   She's not a bashful person.
They can be preceded by such modifying adverbs as terlalu
'too', paling 'most', begitu 'so', agak 'rather', and followed by
such adverbs as sekali 'very' (see 2.100):
    Pangeran Edward terlalu pendiam.
    Prince Edward is too quiet/a too quiet person.
1.121 A few peN- forms based on adjectives do not behave
as described in section 1.120 but act like nouns (see 1.49).
1.122 A few peN- adjectives are based on verbs:
   tidur sleep : penidur sleepyhead
   menangis cry : penangis cry-baby
   lupa forget : pelupa forgetful person
   memilih choose : pemilih particular, choosy
These also behave like adjectives, as described in 1.120:
  Anda pelupa sekali.
  You are a really forgetful person.
  Pasar musik Hong Kong sangat pemilih.
  The Hong Kong music market is very choosy,
Circumfix ke-...-an
1.123 This occurs with a small number of common
adjectives and with banyak and lebih to indicate excess, being
synonymous with terlalu 'too':
   kecil small : kekecilan too small
   mahal expensive : kemahalan too expensive
   manis sweet : kemanisan too sweet
   tua old : ketuaan too old
   banyak much : kebanyakan too much
   lebih more : kelebihan excessive, too much
This function of ke-...-an is borrowed from Javanese and is
not considered standard by all educated speakers:
   Baju ini kebesaran bagi saya.
   This shirt is too big for me.
   kamu kebanyakan uang.
   You have too much money.
1.124 Occurring with a limited number of reduplicated
noun and adjective bases ke-...-an forms adjectives meaning
'possessing to some degree the characteristic indicated by
[base] . It most commonly occurs with colour terms, such as
      1kemerah-merahan 'reddish':
   Warna kemejanya kuning kemerah-merahan.
   His shirt is a reddish yellow.
With noun bases it usually has a negative connotation:
  kebiru-biruan bluish
  kegelap-gelapan rather dark
  kegila-gilaan slightly crazy
  kekuning-kuningan yellowish
  kebelanda-belandaan westernised (acting like a
     European)
  keilmu-ilmuan quasi-scientific
1.125 Some speakers allow an unreduplicated base with
colour terms and some other adjectives:
   kehijauan greenish
   keperakan silvery
   kepucatan rather pale
In the case of keemasan 'golden' reduplication of the base
does not occur.
Reduplication does not occur if the base is already
reduplicated:
   kanak-kanak young child : kekanak-kanakan childish
   laki-laki man : kelaki-lakian mannish (of a woman)
   malu-malu shy : kemalu-maluan rather shy
Suffixes -/, -wi, ~iah
1.126 The suffix -i/«wi derives adjectives from nouns. It is
very limited in application, occurring only with some words
borrowed from Sanskrit and Arabic. The variant -I follows a
final consonant and -wi follows a final vowel:
   alam the world, nature : alami natural
   dunia world : duniawi worldly (hal-hal duniawi worldly
       matters)
   hewan animal : hewani bestial, relating to animals
   Islam Islam : Islami Islamic
   manusia human : manusiawi humane
   surga heaven : surgawi heavenly
With some words an alternative suffix -iah occurs:
  alami, alamiah natural
  badani, badaniah physical, bodily
Special forms occur with base bumi 'world : bumiawi 'earthly,
                                             1terrestrial', and with roh 'spirit : rohani, rohaniah 'spiritual'.
                               1Prefix se-
1.127 One function of se- is to form adjectives meaning
'sharing [base], having the same [base]', where the base is a
noun. There are two distributions for these forms. They may
occur in a noun phrase, following the noun and preceding a
possessor:
   Dia teman sekelas saya.
   He is a class-mate of mine,
   rekan sekamarnya
   his room mate
The possessor may be absent if it is clear from context:
  Dia pergi dengan dua puluh delapan orang senasib.
  He went with twenty eight people who had suffered the
  same fate.
Alternatively, the se-[base] form may occur as a predicate and
be followed by an accompaniment phrase beginning with
dengan 'with' (see 2.210):
   Dia sekelas dengan saya.
   He's in the same class as me.
   Istrinya seranjang dengan kedua anaknya.
   His wife shared a bed with her two children.
Other words in this group include:
   searah (dengan) having the same direction/purpose (as)
  seimbang (dengan) in balance (with)
  sekantor (dengan) sharing an office (with)
   selaras (dengan) in harmony (with)
  sependapat (dengan) of the same opinion (as)
   seumur (dengan) being the same age (as)
   setara (dengan) equal (to), matching, on the same level
      (as)
1.128 Prefix se- also forms equative adjective phrases.
These are discussed in 2.103.
1.129 The combination of se- and a noun sometimes forms
an adjective meaning 'all, the whole [base]', being equivalent
to seluruh 'whole . Thus se-Asia 'all-Asia', as in konperensi
                 1pangan se-Asia 'all-Asia food conference':
   se-Indonesia all-Indonesia
   sedunia (whole) world
   (orang) sekampung the whole village
Suffix -an
1.130 With measures of time, weight and distance, -an
forms adjectives meaning 'done, happening, appearing once
in the measure indicated by the base'. Thus, tahun 'year' is
the base for tahunan 'annual, yearly', as in ujian tahunan
'annual exam':
   bulanan monthly
   harian daily
   mingguan weekly
 - kiloan by the kilo
   meteran by the meter
1.131 Nouns such as koran 'newspaper' and majalah
'magazine , are frequently omitted when followed by harian
         1'daily' and mingguan 'weekly', these words then acting as
nouns:
    (koran) harian daily (paper)
   (majalah) mingguan weekly (magazine)
1.132 With some noun bases -an derives adjectives
meaning 'having many [base], containing many [base]' or
'suffering from [base]':
   cacing worm : cacingan infested with worms
   jamur fungus, mould : jamuran mouldy
   kudis scabies : kudisan suffering from scabies
   semut ant : semutan suffer pins and needles
   uban grey hair : ubanan grey haired
Prefix tuna-
1J33 The prefix tuna- 'without' is a borrowing from
Sanskrit. It usually occurs with bases which are themselves
from Sanskrit, to produce euphemisms for more common
terms:
   tunakarya unemployed (karya work)
   tunasusila immoral (susila decent, moral)
   tunawisma homeless (wisma building, house)
Prefix antar-
1.134 This is a borrowing from Sanskrit, meaning 'inter-':
   antarbangsa international (bangsa people, nation)
   antarbudaya cross-cultural (budaya culture)
   antarpulau inter-island (pulau island)Derivation of adverbs and adjuncts
1.135 Adjuncts are components of a clause which give
information about such matters as place, time, frequency, and
manner (see 2.l65ff). The term adverb is used here to refer
to adjuncts of manner (see 2.166) and modifying adverbs
within adjective phrases (see 2.100). Adverbs of manner
based on numbers are described in sections 1.159-60, 1.163.
Affixation se~...-nya with reduplicated bases
1.136 With reduplicated adjective bases this affixation
derives adverbs meaning 'as [base] as possible':
   baik good : sebaik-baiknya as well as possible
   cepat fast : secepat-cepatnya as fast as possible
   keras hard : sekeras-kerasnya as hard as possible
   lekas soon, quickly : selekas-lekasnya as soon/quickly as
      possible
   tinggi high : setinggi-tingginya as high as possible
   Ali melempar batu itu sejauh-jauhnya.
   Ali threw the stone as far as possible.
   Dia lari secepat-cepatnya.
   She ran as fast as possible.
   Dia harus dihukum seberat-beratnya.
   He must be punished as severely as possible.
These adverbs are further discussed in 2.173-4.
1.137 A few words of this structure mean 'at the most
[base]'; bases are adjectives or modifying adverbs (see 2.100-
1):
    dikit, sedikit a little : sedikit-dikitnya at least
    kurang less : sekurang-kurangnya at least, at the least
    lambat late : selambat-lambatnya at the latest
    lebih more : selebih-lebihnya at most
    Saya harus berangkat ke Indonesia selambat-lambatnya
    tanggal 25 Juli.
    I must leave for Indonesia by the 25th of July at the latest.
    Anda harus menunggu sekurang-kurangnya sepuluh
    menit.
    You must wait at least ten minutes.
1.138 These forms can occasionally occur without
reduplication:
   Sedikitnya dua puluh orang tewas.
   At least twenty people died.
   Dia sadar sepenuhnya bahwa saya benar.
   He's fully aware that I am correct.
1.139 A few forms are based on words of other classes:
   setidak-tidaknya at least
   sedapat-dapatnya as well as possible, as much as one is
       capable of
   Kalau tidak bisa datang sendiri, setidak-tidaknya
   menelpon.
   If you can't come yourself, at least phone.
   Saya akan berusaha sedapat-dapatnya.
   I will try as well as I can/to the best of my ability.
1.140 A few forms, based on adjectives or other classes,
have meanings such as 'as one likes'. Most of these occur
without reduplication of the base:
   seenak-enaknya, seenaknya as one likes
   semau-maunya, semaunya as one likes
   seadanya as it is, as one finds it
   sekenanya at random, in disorganised fashion
   Mereka parkir seenaknya.
   They park just as they please.
1.141 A number of forms, such as sebenarnya 'actually'
and seharusnya 'should' are sentence adjuncts. These are
discussed in 4.106-7. Several forms, including setibanya 'on
his arrival' and sepulangnya 'on his return home', function as
subordinate clauses or time, discussed in section 4.71.
Suffix -an with reduplicated bases
1.142 A few adverbs of manner are formed by adding -an
to reduplicated adjective, verb and noun bases:
    angin-anginan capriciously, in fits and starts
   besar-besaran on a large scale
   habis-habisan exhaustively, vehemently
   kecil-kecilan on a small scale
   mati-matian with great effort
   terang-terangan frankly, openly
   terus-terusan constantly, on and on
    untung-untungan relying on luck
   Ibu memarahi saya habis-habisan.
   Mother scolded me vehemently.
Circumfix se-...-an with reduplicated bases
1.143 This occurs with two reduplicated bases to form
adjuncts of duration (see 2.204):
   sehari-harian all day long
   semalam-malaman all night long
Prefix ber- with reduplicated bases
1.144 Nouns indicating periods of time and distance can
be reduplicated and prefixed with ber- to form adjuncts of
duration (see 2.203):
   berjam-jam for hours
   berminggu-minggu for weeks
   bertahun-tahun for years
   bermeter-meter (for) meters (and meters)
   berkilo-kilo (for) kilometersDerivation of numbers
1.145 As well as occurring in noun phrases (see 2.13ff)
some numbers can occur as adverbs of manner (see 2.177).
All derived forms based on numbers are described in the
following sections.
Prefix se-
1.146 Meaning 'one' se- has a wide distribution, replacing
the full number satu before classifiers (see 2.21) and
partitives (see 2.27ff) and in a number of other contexts.
1.147 It occurs with group numbers (see 2.107) to form
cardinals:
   sepuluh ten                     sebelas eleven
   seratus one hundred             seribu one thousand
   sejuta a million
1.148 se- also occurs in fractions (see 1.149):
   seperempat one quarter
   seperlima one fifth
It forms special fractions setengah and separuh 'half.
Prefix per-
1.149 This forms fractions, being prefixed to the
denominator and preceded by the numerator:
   sepertiga one third
   tiga perlima three fifths
   tujuh persepuluh seven tenths
   sembilan perseratus nine hundredths
While seperdua 'half is possible, the special forms given in
1.148 are more common.
1.150 In the sporting term perempat final 'quarter final   1per- is not preceded by a number:
   Dia maju ke perempat final.
   He advanced to the quarter final.
Prefix ke-
1.151 This is added to cardinal numbers to form ordinals
(see 2.16):
   kedua second       ketiga third
   kesepuluh tenth    kedua puluh tiga twenty third
For 'first' the form kesatu occurs but pertama is more
common.
Ordinals are sometimes written with Roman numerals, in
which case ke- is not shown:
  HUT XIX (= hari ulang tahun kesembilan belas)
  nineteenth anniversary
1.152 Prefix ke- also forms the interrogative ordinal
keberapa 'how many' (see 4.20) and the indefinite ordinal
kesekian 'umpteenth' (see 2.198).
1.153 Forms derived with ke- are also used for collective
numbers (see 2.17):
   keempat all four kelima all five
Suffix -an
1.154 This suffix occurs with group numbers (see 2.107)
with several meanings.
1.155 With group numbers, but not with their multiples,
-an indicates an indefinite multiple of the group number:
   puluhan tens
   ribuan thousands
   puluhan ribu mobil tens of thousands of cars
Belasan indicates an indefinite number between ten and
twenty:
   belasan hari about two weeks
1.156 With multiples of group numbers it indicates an
estimate, 'about so many, that number or so':
   delapan puluhan about eighty, eighty odd
    dua ratusan about two hundred
    Rumah mereka ditembaki oleh lima puluhan pasukan
    tak dikenal.
    Their houses were fired on by about fifty unidentified
    soldiers.
1.157 With dates which are multiples of puluh the form
refers to a particular decade:
   tahun-tahun delapan puluhan
    the nineteen eighties
    Ia anggota politbiro PKI pada awal 1920-an.
    He was a member of the PKI politbureau in the early
    1920s.
Prefix ber~
1.158 Attached to cardinal numbers from 'two' to 'four' this
derives numbers referring to a group:
   berdua both, two together
   bertiga all three, three together
   berempat all four, four together
These forms occur with pronouns (see 2.79 for examples) but
not with nouns.
1.159 These forms also function as adverbs of manner
meaning 'together in a group of [base]':
   Mereka selalu bersepeda berdua.
   They always cycle together (in a group of two).
   Mereka makan sepiring nasi berempat.
   They ate a plate of rice together in a group of four.
1.160 With reduplicated numbers from 'two' to 'four' ber-
forms adverbs indicating '(acting) in a number of groups of
[base] at a time':
   berdua-dua two at a time, two by two
   bertiga-tiga three at a time, three by three
   berempat-empat four at a time, four by four
   Mereka masuk berdua-dua.
   They entered two by two.
Prefix ber- can be omitted from these forms (see 1.25).
1.161 Attached to reduplicated group numbers ber- forms
indefinite multiples of the base:
   berpuluh-puluh tens
   beratus-ratus hundreds
   berjuta-juta millions
   berpuluh-puluh tahun yang lalu
   decades ago
   Beribu-ribu orang menderita akibat perang itu.
   Thousands of people suffered as a result of the war.
1.162 With reduplicated nouns referring to containers,
weights and measures, ber- forms quantifiers meaning 'in
numbers of [base]' (see 2.33), similar in function to forms
based on numbers (see 1.161) and on periods of time (see
1.144):
   berbotol-botol bottles and bottlesful
   berkarung-karung sacksful
   berkeranjang-keranjang basketsful
   berkilo-kilo kilos and kilos
   bermeter-meter meters and meters
   bertimbun-timbun piles and piles
   berton-ton tons and tons
   Bangunan ini menghabiskan berton-ton batu bata.
   This building used up tons and tons of bricks.
   Polisi menyita berbotol-botol minuman keras.
   Police confiscated bottles and bottles of alcohol.
Circumfix ber-...-an
1.163 this occurs with the numeral dua 'two , with optional
                                               1reduplication, to form an adverb meaning 'together', of action
performed by two people:
   Dia duduk berdua(-dua)an dengan pacarnya.
   He sat together with his girl friend.
Derivation of verbs
1.164 For ease and clarity of description two groups of
verbs are recognised here: primary and secondary verbs.
Primary verbs are those which occur with primary affixation,
as described in sections 1.165-2.45. Secondary verbs are
those which have secondary affixation, which replaces
primary affixation under certain circumstances. Secondary
verbs are described in sections 1.246-85.
Every verb is either transitive or intransitive. Transitive verbs
can have an object and a passive form; intransitive verbs have
neither. Transitivity is discussed in 3.18-25.
Verbs are based on nouns, adjectives and other classes. A
base which cannot occur alone as a word is a verbal base.
Thus atur cannot occur alone but is the base for verbs such as
mengatur 'organise ; it is therefore a verbal base.
                    1
Primary verbs
1.165 Primary verbs are either intransitive or transitive.
Intransitive primary verbs are simple, that is, they have no
affix, or have prefix ber- or meN-. All transitive primary
verbs occur with one of the inflectional voice affixes, meN- or
di-. Transitive verbs are either simple, having no affix other
than meN- or di-, or they occur with one of the following
affixes or affix combinations: -kan, -i, per-, per-...-kan, per-Simple intransitive verbs
1.166 A simple intransitive verb occurs alone without an
affix. There are a great many of these, of which the following
are a small sample:
   bangun wake up                 benci hate
   cinta love                     datang come
   duduk sit                      gagal fail
   hidup live                     ikut follow
   ingat remember                jatuh fall
   kembali return                 lenyap disappear
   lulus pass                     lupa forget
   mandi bath                     masuk enter
   mati die                        menang win
   mulai begin                     percaya believe
   pergi go                        pindah move
   selesai finish                  tahu know
   tenggelam sink                  terbang fly
   tiba arrive                     tidur sleep
Intransitive verbs with ber-
1.167 Some ber- verbs have verbal bases. It is difficult to
assign a meaning to ber- with such bases other than that its
presence is necessary to produce a well-formed verb. Some
of these verbs take a complement (see 3.63-4):
   berangkat leave              berenang swim
   berbaring lie                belajar study
   berbuat do                   berhenti stop
   bekerja work                 berdiri stand
   bertemu meet                 berubah change
   berpikir think               bertiup blow
   bercukur shave               berputar turn
1.168 A few ber- verbs which refer to reflexive action
optionally take diri 'self in a compound form:
   berdiam (diri) be silent
   berjemur (diri) sunbake, go out in the sun
   berhias (diri) dress, groom oneself
In this construction diri cannot be expanded as it can when it
is a separate phrase (see 2.162ff).
1.169 The largest group of ber- verbs have noun bases.
With these it is possible to assign a function to ber-. There is
considerable variation in the categories recognised by
different writers and the function of the prefix with some
noun bases is open to different interpretations. However,
there is little purpose in striving to identify a large number of
categories, each with a small number of members and a very
narrow semantic range. The groupings suggested here could
all be subdivided into smaller groups.
1.170 The largest group has a general meaning 'have, own
[base]'. Some of these verbs do not translate well as 'have
[base] , such as berdebu 'dusty (literally 'have dust ), or
     1                           1                    1berguna 'useful* ('have use'); in such cases the appropriate
gloss is provided. Some of these verbs take a complement
(see 3.64). This group includes:
   berguna useful                beristeri have a wife
   berisi contain                berbau smell
   berduri thorny                berdebu dusty
   berumur be aged               beranak have children
   bermaksud mean                berhasil succeed
   bernama be named
   berpendapat have the opinion
1.171 Some verbs mean 'to use, wear, travel by [base]'. TQ
this group can be added forms based on pronouns meaning
'use [base] when speaking to someone':
   bertopi wear a hat           berbedak wear powder
   berdasi wear a tie           berkuda ride a horse
   berjas wear a jacket         berperahu go by boat
   bersepatu wear shoes         bersepeda ride a bicycle
   berbapak use bapak 'father' when addressing someone
    beraku use aku T when speaking to someone
1.172 Another subgroup of ber- verbs mean 'produce
[base]'. Many of these refer to production of the sound
indicated by the base:
   berkeringat sweat              berbohong lie
   bertelur lay an egg            berdesing whizz, buzz
   beranak give birth             berkokok crow
   berbuah bear fruit             berderit squeak
   berteriak scream               berbunyi make a sound
   berkata say
   bercerita relate, tell a story
1.173 Some ber- verbs with noun bases are reciprocal,
indicating that two people stand in the same relationship to
each other, as specified by the base. Thus bertetangga 'be
neighbours', as in Ali dan Tomo bertetangga 'Ali and Tomo
are neighbours (with each other)':
   berteman be friends
   bermusuh be enemies
   bersahabat be friends
   berkenalan be acquaintances
   berkerabat be related
   bertunangan be engaged to each other
   bersaudara be relatives of same generation
   bersaingan be competitors, compete (with each other)
The verbs berkenalan, bertunangan, bersaingan and similar
forms having suffix -an are regarded here as being built on
bases kenalan 'acquaintance , tunangan 'fiance , saingan
                               1                    1'competitor', and so on. They could alternatively be treated as
ber-...-an reciprocal verbs (see 1,255ff) built on verbal bases
such as kenal, tunang and saing.
1.174 Some ber- verbs refer to work which is regularly
performed or done for a living. In this group are included
some verbs with verbal bases:
   berdagang engage in trade
   berkebun own or work gardens
   berkuli work as a labourer
   berladang own or work unirrigated fields
   bersawah own or work rice fields
   bertani farm
   bertukang work as an artisan
   beternak engage in animal farming
Some verbs in this group optionally have a complement (see
3.64). These differ from transitive verbs with an object in that
they specify habitual action rather than an action performed
on a particular object:
   berburu (rusa) engage in (deer) hunting
   bertanam (jagung) plant (corn) (as an occupation)
1.175 Similar to verbs listed in 1.174 are those which mean
'engage in the activity specified by the base'; many of these
are based on nouns referring to types of sport:
   berolah raga play sport
   bertinju box
   bergulat wrestle
   berpiknik go on a picnic
   berperang wage war
   berbelanja go shopping
   bertamasya go sight-seeing
   berdarmawisata go on an excursion
1.176 Many ber- verbs have noun bases which are phrases.
Although these are written as separate words they act as a
single unit to which ber- is attached. As free forms the bases
are noun phrases consisting usually of a noun and noun (see
2.37) or noun and adjective (see 2.45). Thus the phrase
celana pendek 'short pants' becomes the base of the verb
bercelana pendek 'wear short pants'. Other compounds
consist of a noun plus number. In a free phrase the number
precedes the noun (see 2.14); it is placed after the noun when
the phrase becomes a verbal base. Thus dua anak 'two
children' forms the base of beranak dua 'have two children':
   berbaju kulit wear a leather coat
   berkaki panjang have long legs
   berkebun kelapa have a coconut plantation
   berkepala gundul have a shaved head
   berpendidikan rendah be poorly educated
   bertubuh kurus be thin (have a thin body)
   bertingkat tiga have three storeys, three-storey
Such phrasal verb bases should not be confused with verbs
followed by a complement. In the sentence Dia bernama Ali
'He is named Ali', the verb bernama 'have the name' is
followed by a complement, Ali. The words nama 'name' and
Ali do not form a phrase but rather a clause, Nama(nya) Ali
'His name is Ali'. Such complements are described in section
3.64.
1.177 A few ber- verbs have adjective bases:
   bergembira be glad         berbahagia be happy
   berterus-terang be frank bersedih be sad
   berkeras persist           bersabar be patient
Prefix ber- combined with prefix si-
1.178 The combination bersi- occurs with a few verbs. In
all cases si- is optional:
    bersikeras, berkeras persist
    bersitegang, bertegang persevere
    bersikukuh, berkukuh be stubborn, persist
   bersijingkat, berjingkat walk on tiptoes
Intransitive verbs with meN-
1.179 Some intransitive verbs with prefix meN- have verbal
bases. MeN- cannot be assigned a function with these verbs,
other than that its presence is required to produce a well-
formed verb. Verbs in this group include:
   menangis cry             mendidih boil
   menyerah surrender       mengungsi flee
   melapor report           meledak explode
   menyanyi sing            menyuruk hide
   mengeluh complain        menelentang lie on the back
   meluncur slide           menginap spend the night
   menikah marry            melompat jump
1.180 Many meN- intransitive verbs have noun bases. As
with ber- verbs based on nouns, a number of different
meanings can be identified.
1.181 Some verbs mean 'go to [base]', where the base refers
to a location:
   mendarat land                menepi move to the side
   melaut go to sea             mengutara go north
   menyeberang cross to the other side
1.182 Others mean 'produce [base]', where the base is a
sound:
   mengeong miouw           meraung roar
   menjerit scream          mendengkur snore
   menggonggong bark        mengeluh groan
   mengerang groan          memekik scream
1.183 Some meN- verbs with noun bases mean 'become
like, resemble [base]':
   memuncak reach a crest, culminate
   menggunung pile up, mount up
   membatu petrify, harden
   membukit form a heap, resemble a hill
   membabi buta rage blindly
1.184 With adjective bas< meN- usually forms verbs
meaning 'become [base], take the characteristic of [base]':
   menghebat intensify       membengkak swell
   menghangat warm up        menguning grow yellow
   mereda calm down, abate membusuk rot, decay
   mengering dry             memutih become white
   menyempit tighten,        memerah redden,
    constrict                  become red
Prefix meN- cannot be added to all adjectives with this
meaning. The number of such forms is limited and
unpredictable, although there is some degree of productivity.             4
The verb memanjang (panjang long') means 'stretch', as in
Pantai itu memanjang dari barat ke timur 'The beach
stretches from west to east'.
Comparison of simple, ber- and meN- intransitive verbs
1.185 Verb bases occur with ber-, meN- or without
affixation unpredictably. For instance, there is no
explanation for the following forms other than usage: mandi
'bath', berbaring 'lie down', menginap 'stay'. With such forms
ber- and meN- can be ascribed no function other than that
they are required with particular bases.
If the base is other than a verb then either ber- or meN- must
occur to derive a verb. Here also there is sometimes no
predictability about which affix will occur. Thus: berteriak
'yell, shout', memekik 'scream'.
With a number of bases ber- and meN- can substitute for each
other, although usually one form is more common than the
other. A number of these forms mean 'produce the sound
indicated by the base'. Others have verb bases:
   bernyanyi, menyanyi sing
   berderit, menderit scream
      There is disagreement as to the acceptability of some forms. Thus
      Kamus Besar Bahasa Indonesia (1991) gives membiru 'become
      blue', whereas Dardjowidjojo (1978: 264) rules this word out. Such
      disagreement reflects a degree of productivity and the gradual spread
      of meN- to an increasing number of adjective bases.
   berteduh, meneduh take shelter
   berdengkur, mendengkur snore
   berbekas, membekas leave a trace or mark
   berdoa, mendoa pray
   bersebar, menyebar spread out
   berludah, meludah spit
In a few other cases two forms occur but with a clear
difference in meaning:
   tinggal live : meninggal die
   pulang go home : berpulang die
   lari run, flee, escape : berlari run
Transitive verb affixation
1.186 Transitive verbs are inflected for voice; meN- marks
active voice, di- marks passive voice. Voice is discussed in
3.26-40. Under some circumstances these affixes are
omitted, for instance meN- in certain imperative constructions,
di- with first and second person agent. These processes are
described in the appropriate places.
In addition, meN- is usually omitted with a few common
verbs: makan 'eat', minum 'drink', minta 'request', mohon
'request', although affixed forms of these, memakan etc., do
occur. Without the prefix these behave differently from other
transitive verbs in some ways; for instance, they cannot take
bound objects, such as -nya (see 2.71).
The verb mengerti 'understand' is unusual in that the prefix
does not drop in the passive (see 3.27), thus dimengerti
'understood'. Some grammarians account for this by treating
mengerti as not having a prefix, meng being part of the base.
However, the verb was originally based on arti 'meaning' and
meng- is not retained in the presence of circumfix peN-...
-an, thus pengertian 'understanding'. It must therefore be
regarded as a prefix.
In colloquial usage meN- may frequently be dropped,
although consideration of this lies outside the scope of this
work. It is just noted here that the tendency for meN- to be
dropped increases as the degree of informality of the speech
situation increases. 5
Apart from the above contexts, meN- is predictably present
on active transitive verbs and is consequently omitted from
illustrative examples in some grammar works. However,
because its occurence is required in most natural contexts it is
retained in examples here. That is, the examples are given in
the active voice form of the verb.
Simple transitive verbs
1.187 Most simple transitive verbs have verb bases. They
have no affixes other than one of the voice affixes meN- if
active and dl- if passive. There are a great many such verbs
and the following list is far from exhaustive:
   membuka open                    menutup close
   membangun build                 mendorong push
   memukul hit                     memotong chop
   membeli buy                     menjual sell
   menyewa rent                    melihat see
   mendengar hear                  menulis write
   membaca read                    membawa carry
   mengambil fetch                 mengangkat lift
   menolong help                   merasa feel
   mencuri steal                   memegang hold
1.188 Some simple transitive verbs are based on nouns and
mean 'use [base] on the object, apply [base] to the object'.
Some of these can occur without the object being expressed,
as described in section 3.21.
   menyapu sweep
   memotret photograph
   memborgol handcuff
   melap, mengelap wipe
   menggergaji saw
      Anderson (1983: 6) notes that in a particular survey meN- was
      dropped in only 21% of cases when the addressee was a stranger, a
      situation in which language is likely to be more formal, but was
      dropped in up to 67% of cases when the addressee was a member of
      the speaker's family, a situation in which informal style is most
      likely.
   mencat, mengecat paint
   menyemir polish
   mempel, mengepel mop
   menambal, menampal patch, mend
   menggunting cut (with scissors)
   mengebor bore, drill
Transitive verbs with suffix -kan
1.189 All verbs with suffix -kan are transitive with the
exception of merupakan (see 3.25). A number of different
functions of -kan can be identified, although it is also
possible to regard it as having two basic functions, that of
marking the object as patient and that of marking the object
as beneficiary. The different roles of participants in the
action, such as patient and beneficiary, are discussed in
section 3.17.
With all non-benefactive verbs -kan marks the object as the
patient of the action, that is, the thing which is manipulated,
acted on or moved by the action. With some verbs this
participant can also be regarded as the instrument (see 1.205).
1.190 With many verb bases -kan has no other function
than identifying the object as the patient of the action. Like
ber- and meN- with intransitive verb bases it is simply
required to produce a well-formed verb. Verbs in this group
include:
   melemparkan throw              meninggalkan leave
   mengerjakan do, work           menguraikan analyse
   merundingkan discuss           memikirkan think about
   menyebutkan mention            melakukan do, carry out
   membutuhkan need               melaksanakan carry out
   menerangkan explain            menghamburkan scatter
   menerapkan apply               mengharapkan hope
   membicarakan discuss           mengenakan put on
   menyiarkan broadcast           menerjemahkan translate
   menghiraukan pay attention to
   menyumbangkan contribute
   mengadakan do, carry out
   membandingkan compare
   menganjurkan urge, suggest
With some bases, including some listed above, -kan is
optional, as discussed in section 1.210. With some verbs -kan
can be replaced by suffix -i; in this case the object is the
recipient or location rather than the patient (see 1.212).
Causative -kan
1.191 With many verbs -kan has a causative function. The
base may be an adjective, noun or verb.
1.192 If the base is an adjective the object is caused to have
the quality or characteristic specified by the base. Thus
membersihkan means 'cause object to be clean (bersih)':
   Kamar ini sudah bersih.
   This room is clean.
   Siti sudah membersihkan kamar ini.
   Siti has cleaned this room.
This form is very productive and can be based on most
adjectives:
   mengamankan pacify, render safe (aman peaceful, safe)
   membersihkan clean (bersih clean)
   melebarkan widen (lebar wide)
   mengeringkan dry (kering dry)
   membebaskan set free, release (bebas free)
   mematikan extinguish (mati dead)
   melembutkan soften (lembut soft)
A few adjectives do not form bases for such verbs. Thus
indah 'beautiful' does not form the base of such a verb;
mengindahkan 'pay attention to' has an unrelated verbal base.
1.193 With a few verbs the meaning is not predictable from
the meaning of the adjective base:
  - membenarkan correct; confirm; approve (benar right,
      correct)
   memberatkan make things difficult for (berat heavy)
   menyulitkan cause difficulty for (sulit difficult)
   menggelapkan embezzle (gelap dark)
    meremehkan belittle; underestimate (remeh of no
      importance)
   memuliakan honour deeply (mulia noble)
1.194 One subtype of causatives are based on adjectives
indicating emotions and attitudes. These verbs indicate that
the subject causes the object to experience the emotion or
attitude expressed by the base. When the object is understood
as applying to everyone in general it is typically omitted:
    Film itu membosankan.
    That movie is boring.
    Pidatonya mengecewakan.
    His speech was disappointing.
    Madonna mengejutkan.
    Madonna is startling.
Such verbs can function as ordinary transitives when the
action applies to a particular object:
   Film-film seperti itu membosankan saya.
   Movies like that bore me.
   Pidatonya mengecewakan para pemilih.
   His speech disappointed the voters.
   Madonna mengejutkan publik lagi.
   Madonna has startled the public again.
When there is no object these verbs function like adjectives
and are usually translated by adjectives, as in the above
examples. Like adjectives they can take modifying adverbs,
such as kian 'increasingly' and sangat 'very (see 2.100):
                                          1   Kondisinya kian memprihatinkan.
   His condition is causing increasing concern.
   Kabar itu sangat menyedihkan.
   The news was very saddening.
Other verbs in this group include the following. Typical
translations with and without an object are given:
   memuaskan satisfy / satisfying
   memalukan embarrass / embarrassing
   mengejutkan startle / startling
   menyenangkan please / pleasing
   meyakinkan convince / convincing
   menakutkan frighten / frightening
   menyedihkan sadden / saddening
   mencemaskan make apprehensive / cause apprehension
   mengagumkan fill with admiration / admirable
With these verbs a phrase beginning with untuk or bagi (see
2.105) may occur instead of an object. In this case the verb
behaves like an adjective and is translated as such:
   Kelakuannya memalukan ibunya.
   His behaviour embarrassed his mother.
   Kelakuannya memalukan bagi ibunya.
   His behaviour was embarrassing for his mother.
1.195 The verb mengherankan 'amazing frequently 1occurs with tidak, meaning 'no wonder, it's not surprising':
   Tidak mengherankan perusahaan itu terus berkembang
   dengan pesatnya.
   It's not surprising that company continues to grow quickly.
1.196 A number of verbs whose bases do not indicate
emotions or attitudes, including some with noun bases,
function in the same way as the emotive verbs and can be
grouped with them, such as:
   merugikan inflict a loss on, damage / damaging, harmful
      (rugi suffer a loss)
   menghebohkan cause a sensation, cause an uproar /
      sensational (heboh commotion, uproar)
   mengesankan impress / impressive (kesan impression)
   merepotkan cause difficulty for / causing difficulty, being
      a nuisance (repot busy, going to trouble)
   Keputusan itu sangat merepotkan.
   The decision caused a great deal of difficulty.
1.197 Some of the verbs in this group can also indicate that
the subject undergoes the emotion expressed by the base.
Thus, as well as meaning 'cause apprehension', mencemaskan
can mean 'feel apprehension'. As well as meaning 'cause to be
proud', membanggakan can mean 'be proud of, and
mengkhawatirkan can mean 'worry about' as well as meaning
'cause worry':
   Banyak pengamat mencemaskan bahwa Kim akan
   gagal.
   Many observers are apprehensive that Kim will fail.
   Pak Hasrun membanggakan anaknya.
   Mr Hasrun is proud of his son.
   Terus terang, kami mengkhawatirkan munculnya
   monopoli baru.
   Frankly, we are worried about the appearance of new
   monopolies.
This function is not frequent with active verbs, although it is
increasing in journalistic style. However, it occurs regularly if
the verb is passive (see 3.26); that is, the agent experiences the
emotion indicated by the base rather than causing someone
else to experience it:
   Mereka tak perlu kausedihkan, (cf. menyedihkan
       sadden)
   There's no need for you to feel sorry for them.
   Itu yang saya takutkan, (cf. menakutkan frighten)
   That's what I'm afraid of.
   Kelakuannya tidak usah dimalukan, (cf. memalukan
       embarrass)
   There's no need to be embarrassed by his behaviour.
   Anaknya selalu dirisaukannya, (cf. merisaukan cause
       (object) to worry; worry about)
   She's always worried about her child.
1.198 When the base of a -kan verb is an intransitive verb
the meaning is usually 'cause the object to perform [base]'.
Thus m e m b a n g u n k a n 'wake (someone) up' and
mendaratkan 'land (something)' are based on the intransitive
verbs bangun 'wake up' and mendarat 'land' respectively:
   Siti bangun.
   Siti woke up.
   Ibu membangunkan Siti.
   Mother woke Siti up.
   Pesawat sudah mendarat.
   The plane has landed.
   Pilot sudah mendaratkan pesawat.
   The pilot has landed the plane.
Other verbs in this group include the following. The
corresponding intransitive verb is indicated in parentheses:
   menjatuhkan drop (jatuh fall)
   mengembalikan return, take back (kembali return, go
      back)
   menaikkan raise (naik go up)
   melahirkan give birth to (lahir be born)
   mendirikan establish, set up (berdiri stand)
   mengumpulkan collect (berkumpul collect, gather)
   menghentikan stop (berhenti stop)
   menyatukan unite (bersatu united)
   menyingkirkan remove, eliminate (menyingkir step aside)
   mendekatkan bring nearer (mendekat approach)
   menyurukkan hide (menyuruk hide)
1.199 In three words the prefix ber- of the corresponding
intransitive verb is retained when meN- is added. In two cases
the base without ber- also occurs, the verbs having different
meanings with and without ber-. All the transitive verbs
except melakukan have causative meaning:
    memberhentikan dismiss, sack (berhenti stop);
      menghentikan stop
   memberangkatkan dispatch (berangkat depart)
   memberlakukan apply, put into effect (rules) (berlaku
      apply, be in effect); melakukan do, perform
In one word the prefix meN- of the corresponding intransitive
verb is retained, there also being a form derived directly from
the adjective base:
   memeratakan distribute evenly (merata become even);
   meratakan make level, smooth (rata level, smooth, even)
1.200 Causative verbs can be based on simple transitive
verbs. These indicate that the subject causes another person
to carry out the action on the object. The one who carries out
the action is expressed by a prepositional phrase beginning
with kepada or pada. Sometimes the causative verb has a
different translation in English from the simple verb. Thus
meminjam 'borrow and meminjamkan 'lend (i.e. cause
                     1someone to borrow)':
   Ali meminjam buku saya.
   Ali borrowed my book.
   Saya meminjamkan buku saya kepada Ali.
   I lent my book to Ali.
For the majority of verbs in this group, however, the causative
form has no direct translation into English. This requires a
circumlocution in the English translation of the type 'have
something done by someone', with a passive verb. Thus
m e m e r i k s a k a n is translated 'have the object
inspected/checked by someone' and mencucikan is translated
'have the object washed by someone':
   Dokter memeriksa mata saya.
   The doctor checked my eyes.
   Saya memeriksakan mata ke dokter.
   I had my eyes checked by the doctor.
   Wanita itu mencuci pakaian saya.
   That woman washes my clothes.
   Saya mencucikan pakaian pada wanita itu.
   I have my clothes washed by that woman.
With a number of verbs in this group a location is more likely
to be expressed than an actor; in either case the preposition
can be pada:
   Di mana kau mencucikan pakaianmu?
   Where do you have your clothes washed?
   Tetangga saya selalu mereparasikan mobilnya pada
   bengkel ini.
   My neighbour always has his car repaired at this garage.
      (mereparasi repair)
   Saya mau mencetakkan kartu nama saya di percetakan
   baru itu.
   I want to get my calling cards printed at that new printery.
      (mencetak print)
With some verbs an acceptable English translation is possible
without a passive, even if there is no special equivalent to the
-kan verb. In the following examples membebankan 'cause
(object) to be borne' and menontonkan 'cause (object) to be
viewed' can be translated 'impose a burden' and 'display,
exhibit' respectively:
   Polisi memikul beban ganti rugi.
   The police bore the burden of compensation.
   Hakim memikulkan beban ganti rugi pada polisi.
   The judge imposed the burden of compensation on the
   police.
   Pengunjung menonton hasil kemajuan yang terakhir.
   The visitors viewed the results of the latest progress.
   Mereka menontonkan hasil kemajuan yang terakhir.
   They display the results of the latest progress.
Other verbs in this group include the following. A gloss with
a passive verb is provided where this is the most natural
translation:
   meminumkan cause (object) to be drunk, give (object) to
       be drunk
   menyewakan rent out, lease out
   menjahitkan have (object) sewn
   menggilingkan have (object) milled
   mengoperasikan have (object) operated on
   menimbangkan have (object) weighed
   menambalkan have (object) patched
   memuatkan load, cause (truck) to hold (memuat) a load
   menyunatkan have (son) circumcised
1.201 Many -kan verbs are based on nouns. There are
several functions of which only the commonest are listed in
the following sections.
1.202 Some verbs mean 'put the object in [base], or take
the object to [base] , where the base is a location. Thus
                     1memakamkan 'bury' means 'cause the object to be put in a
makam (grave)'. Other examples:
    memasarkan (take to) market (pasar market)
    mengandangkan put in a stable/pen (kandang animal
      enclosure)
    mementaskan stage (a play) (pentas stage)
    meliburkan send on holiday (libur leave, holiday)
    meminggirkan put to the edge (pinggir edge)
  ' menggudangkan store, put in a store (gudang warehouse)
    memenjarakan put in jail (penjara jail)
    menyekolahkan send to school (sekolah school)
A number of verbs in this group have as their base directional
ke 'to' and usually a locative noun, the most frequent being
mengemukakan 'state, present, put forward', based on k e
muka 'to the front':
   Dia sudah mengemukakan pendapatnya mengenai
   pembredelan majalah itu.
   He has presented his opinion on the banning of the
   magazine.
Others verbs in this group are:
  mengetengahkan produce (evidence); set forth (ke tengah
      to the centre)
  mengesampingkan put aside, ignore (ke samping to the
      side)
  mengebumikan bury (ke bumi into the earth)
  mengeluarkan put/take outside (ke luar to the outside)
1.203 Many -kan verbs with noun bases mean 'cause the
object to be [base], treat the object as [base], give the object as
[base]'. Thus mengorbankan means 'cause (object) to be a
korban (sacrifice)', mencalonkan means 'cause (object) to be
a calon (candidate)', menghadiahkan means 'give (object) as
a hadiah (present)':
   Orang Toraja mengorbankan banyak kerbau.
   The Torajans sacrificed many buffaloes.
   Dia mencalonkan adiknya.
   He nominated his younger brother.
   Gubernur menghadiahkan sebidang tanah kepada guru
   teladan.
   The governor gave a plot of land (as a gift) to the model
   teacher.
Other verbs in this group include:
   menceritakan tell, narrate (cerita story)
   menasihatkan advise (nasihat advice)
   menargetkan target, aim at (target target)
   merencanakan plan (rencana plan)
   mengabarkan report (kabar news)
   mengkambinghitamkan make (object) a scapegoat
      (kambing hitam scapegoat)
   menjanjikan promise (janji promise)
   mendewakan idolise, treat (object) as a god (dewa god,
      deity)
   mensukseskan make (object) a success (sukses success)
   mengeramatkan consider (object) sacred (keramat
     sacred)
   merahasiakan keep (object) a secret (rahasia secret)
   mewakilkan appoint (object) as representative, delegate
     (wakil representative)
1.204 A number of other categories with small numbers of
members can be identified but many -kan verbs with noun
bases have unpredictable meanings or can only be categorised
unconvincingly. Only the following loose grouping is noted
in addition to the groups listed above.
A few verbs indicate that the subject acts as/is [base] with
respect to the object, gives [base] to the object, or directs
[base] at the object. Thus membahayakan 'be a danger
(bahaya) to':
   Letusan gunung itu membahayakan daerah sekitarnya.
   The eruption of the volcano endangered (was a danger to)
   the surrounding region.
Some other members of this group are:
  mencerminkan reflect (cermin mirror)
  melambangkan symbolise (lambang symbol)
  menyaksikan witness (saksi witness)
  membuktikan prove (bukti proof)
  mengecohkan deceive (kecoh fraud, deceit)
Instrumental' -kan
1.205 With one group of verbs -kan is usually interpreted
as marking the object as instrument. These verbs are based
on simple transitive verbs with a change in structure such that
the object of the simple verb becomes the location with the
-kan verb and the instrument of the simple verb becomes the
object with the -kan verb. This is shown by the following
examples:
   Dia memukul anjing dengan tongkat.
   He hit the dog with a stick.
   Dia memukulkan tongkat pada anjing.
   He used the stick to beat the dog with.
   Dia menikam perut harimau dengan belati.
   He stabbed the tiger's belly with a knife.
   Dia menikamkan belati ke perut harimau.
   He thrust the knife into the tiger's belly.
As the above examples show, there is frequently no direct
translation into English of -kan instrumental forms. Thus,
menikamkan belati is translated 'thrust the knife', whereas it
literally means 'stab-with a knife'. Sometimes, however, a
more literal translation is natural in English. Thus 'tie' and
'wrap' can translate both the non-instrumental and the
instrumental verbs in the following:
    Dia mengikat anjing dengan tali.
    He tied up the dog with a rope.
    Dia mengikatkan tali ke anjing.
    He tied the rope to the dog.
    Perawat membalut lukanya dengan kain.
    The nurse wrapped his wound with a bandage.
    Perawat membalutkan kain ke lukanya.
    The nurse wrapped the cloth around his wound.
Other examples:
   Dia menyentuhkan gelas pada bibir temannya. (cf.
      menyentuh bibirnya touch his lips)
   He touched the glass to his friend's lips.
   Aku memelukkan tangan pada pinggangnya, (cf.
      memeluk pinggangnya embrace her waist)
   I wrapped my arms around her waist.
Other verbs in this class, with typical instrumental objects
shown in parentheses, include:
   memotongkan (parang) chop with (a machete)
   mencukurkan (pisau) shave with (a knife)
   mengetokkan (palu) knock with (a hammer)
   menembakkan (pistol) shoot with (a pistol)
   mencambukkan (tali) whip with (a rope)
   menutupkan (kain) cover with (a cloth)
   menampalkan (plester) patch with (plaster)
   mencengkamkan (kuku) grasp with (talons)
Although these verbs are usually regarded as marking the
object as being the instrument with which the action is
performed, the object cannot always be so regarded, as shown
by the following:
   Dia memukulkan kepala ke dinding.
   He beat his head against the wall.
   Dia menampalkan gambar ke tembok.
   He stuck pictures on the wall.
These examples show that what is basically important in these
constructions is that the object is something which is handled,
manipulated or moved (the patient - see 3.17); with the
corresponding simple verbs the object is something at which
the action is directed.6Benetactive -kan
1.206 With a number of verbs -kan functions to indicate
that the object is the beneficiary, the person for whose benefit
the action is performed. This is sometimes called 'benefactive
-kan'.
All verbs which can take benefactive -kan also occur as
simple transitive verbs with an object which indicates the
patient. In the benefactive construction there are two objects.
The one immediately following the verb is the primary object,
which identifies the beneficiary; the second is the secondary
object, which indicates the patient (see section 3.20 for further
discussion of primary and secondary objects). The examples
below illustrate simple transitive verbs and their benefactive
counterparts:
   Pelayan mengambil segelas air.
   The waiter fetched a glass of water.
   Pelayan mengambilkan tamu segelas air.
   The waiter fetched the guest a glass of water.
  - Dia menjahit rok.
   She sewed a skirt.
   Dia menjahitkan anaknya rok.
   She sewed her child a skirt.","[53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108]"
"Noun phrases
2.5      Nouns act as heads of a great variety of different
phrase structures. Some of the important components of
noun phrases are discussed in the following sections. Not all
nouns can occur with all the phrase elements discussed; some
subclasses of noun are restricted in the elements with which
they can cooccur.
Demonstratives
2.6      The demonstratives are ini 'this', itu 'that', tersebut
'already mentioned', and tadi 'recently mentioned'.
2.7      The demonstratives ini 'this' and itu 'that' follow the
head noun. As they do not distinguish between one and more
than one they also translate 'these' and 'those' respectively:
   buku ini this book
   kedua buku ini these two books
   negeri itu that country
   negeri-negeri itu those countries
Demonstratives can occur with all classes of nouns including
proper nouns:
   Jakarta ini this (city of) Jakarta
   Siti itu that (girl) Siti
Both Ini and itu can refer to someone or something
previously mentioned but not now present:
   Bagaimana rumah itu?
   What is that house (about which we have been talking)
   like?
   Orang ini baik sekali»
   This person (who we are talking about) is very good.
They can also refer to something physically present, as when
pointing:
   Saya tinggal di rumah ini.
   I live in this house.
   Duduk di kursi itu.
   Sit in that chair.
When referring to something present, but not when referring
to something previously mentioned but not now present, ini
and itu can optionally be preceded by yang for emphasis:
   Rumah besar itu rumah Tomo; saya tinggal di rumah
   yang ini.
   That big house is Tomo's; I live in this house.
   Tulis di buku yang itu; ini buku saya.
   Write in that book; this book is mine.
Besides referring to something being pointed at or something
previously mentioned, itu can also be used with generic
nouns:
   Harimau itu binatang liar.
   The tiger is a wild animal.
In the above sentence harimau itu, like the English 'the tiger ,1refers to all members of the group. Likewise, itu can be used
with certain nominalised verbal clauses (see 3.143), referring
to all instances of the action:
   Lari itu sehat.
   Running is healthy.
2.8      The use of itu sometimes proves a difficulty for
many English speakers, sometimes inaccurately being equated
with 'the'. While both words refer to something definite, a
number of differences occur in their usage. In English 'the is
                                                            1
obligatory with a noun which refers to something unique,
whereas itu cannot occur in this context:
   matahari the sun            bulan the moon
Many nouns refer to something which is unique to one
context but may not be unique in other contexts. Thus
perdana menteri 'prime minister refers to someone unique in
                                   1the discussion of a particular country but not in a discussion
referring to a number of countries. Where it is unique, as in
the first sentence below, itu cannot occur; where it is not
unique, as in the second sentence, itu can occur:
   Perdana menteri sudah pulang.
   The Prime Minister has returned home.
   Kedua perdana menteri itu bersalaman.
   The two prime ministers greeted each other.
In English 'the can refer to something not previously
                 1mentioned, whereas itu cannot. This matter is further
discussed in section 2.50.
2.9      When a non-unique noun has previously been
mentioned it is usually marked by itu if there is nothing else
in the phrase to indicate that it refers back to what has already
been mentioned. Thus in Orang itu teman saya That person
is my friend', orang 'person cannot occur alone because there
                            1is nothing to tell that it refers to someone already mentioned
or being pointed to; only itu marks it as definite, and
therefore already mentioned. If something else marks the
noun as definite itu need not occur (see for instance 3.98).
2.10 In formal writing tersebut 'previously mentioned' is
sometimes used to refer to someone or something already
mentioned:
   Alasan itu dikemukakan oleh para guru bahasa tersebut.
   That reason was put forward by the previously mentioned
   language teachers.
2.11 Although tadi 'just recently' usually occurs as an
adjunct of time (see 2.191) it can follow a noun to refer back
to someone or something recently mentioned or recently
present:
   Kedua pacar tadi sekarang sudah menjadi suami istri»
   The two lovers (who were mentioned a short while ago)
   have now become husband and wife.
   Anaknya mengintip adegan seram tadi.
   His child spied the frightening scene (just referred to).
   Bagaimana pendapat saudara tentang orang tadi?
   What's your opionion of that person (who was here a
   moment ago)?
Quantifiers
2.12 There are several types of quantifier, including
definite and indefinite numbers. Partitives, which indicate
amount, combine with numbers to form quantifiers.
Classifiers are not themselves quantifiers. However, as they
behave in some ways similar to partitives and must occur with
a number, they are included in this section.
Numbers
2.13 Numbers are either definite or indefinite. Definite
numbers include cardinal and ordinal numbers, and fractions.
In sections 2.14 to 2.20 numbers as a component of noun
phrases are discussed. The internal structure of number
phrases is discussed in sections 2.106 to 2.117.
2.14 A cardinal number precedes a count noun (see 2.3)
to indicate the number of things being referred to:
   dua orang two people sepuluh kota ten towns
Cardinal numbers are listed in section 2.107.
2.15 A cardinal number can occur after a noun to
indicate its position in a series. Cardinal numbers are only
used in this way with things which are commonly
distinguished from each other by their position within a
sequence. A question as to the position of the noun in the
sequence is asked by placing berapa after the noun (see
4.19). The contrast between occurrence of cardinals before
and after the head noun is shown in the following examples:
   lima jam five hours : jam lima five o'clock
   tiga halaman three pages : halaman tiga page three
   dua kelas two classes : kelas dua class two
With dates cardinals are used rather than ordinals:
  Mereka akan tiba pada tanggal enam Maret.
  They will arrive on the sixth of March.
Cardinals also follow the word nomor 'number' to indicate a
number in a series:
  Jalan Persahabatan nomor tujuh
  number seven Persahabatan Street
  bis nomor 14
  bus number 14
2.16 With nouns which are not usually distinguished by
their order in a sequence cardinal numbers cannot be used as
described in section 2.15; instead ordinal numbers (see
1.151) are used. These follow the head noun:
   orang ketiga the third person
   minggu keenam the sixth week
Frequently yang precedes the c.dinal:
   Ali anaknya yang kedua.
   Ali is his second child.
2.17 Ordinal numbers from kedua upwards can also
occur before the noun as collective numbers to indicate an
inclusive group of that many, 'both', 'all three' and so on.
Since the noun they refer to is always definite it is always
marked by a demonstrative, a possessive or some other
element which identifies it:
   Saya sudah membaca keempat buku itu.
   I've read those four books.
   Kelima anaknya pandai.
   All five of her children are clever.
When a specific group is not referred to the collective number
is replaced by a cardinal number.
    Saya sudah membaca empat buku minggu ini.
    I've read four books this week.
2.18 Fractions (see 1.149) precede the noun and indicate
how large a part of something is compared to the whole:
   Dua pertiga orang Indonesia tinggal di pulau Jawa.
   Two thirds of Indonesians live in Java.
Fractions can also be included in full numbers (see 2.108).
2.19 Indefinite numbers (see 2.113-7) include words like
banyak 'many and semua 'air. Indefinite numbers precede
               1the noun:
   Semua orang itu bekerja di kota.
   All those people work in town.
The plural marker para is a kind of indefinite number,
discussed in section 2.116.
2.20 The word dari 'of sometimes separates a number
from the following head noun.
If a cardinal number is separated from the noun by dari it
refers to the number within the group specified by the noun:
   Tiga dari orang itu bekerja di rumah sakit.
   Three of those people work in the hospital.
Dari optionally occurs between a fraction and the head noun:
  Seperlima dari mahasiswa itu naik bis ke kampus.
  One fifth of those students get the bus to campus.
A few indefinite numbers are commonly separated from the
head by dari, including sebagian 'a number (of)' and salah
satu/seorang 'one (of)':
   Sebagian dari transmigran itu sudah tahu tentang
   persawahan.
   A number of the transmigrants know about wet rice
   cultivation.
   salah satu/seorang dari teman saya
   one ""of my friends
Classifiers
2.21 A classifier precedes a count noun to place it in a
particular noun class. Classifiers are optional (this is further
discussed in 2.27) and with many nouns they rarely occur.
The classifiers are always preceded by a number. The
number plus classifier can also follow the noun, as discussed
in section 2.31. If the noun is singular se- 'one' precedes the
classifier. Only three classifiers are in frequent use:
   orang used with humans : seorang guru a teacher
   ekor used with living creatures : dua ekor ular/
       ikan/kucing two snakes/fish/cats
   buah used with inanimate things : tiga buah meja/
       pena/rumah three tables/pens/houses
Classifiers are far more likely to occur with se-, meaning 'one 1but translated 'a, an\ than with higher numbers. If the
classifier is absent se- cannot occur:
   Dia seorang guru/Dia guru.
   He is a teacher.
With a classifier the noun is always indefinite. That is, it does
not refer to a specific thing or things; hence a demonstrative
or possessor cannot cooccur with a classifier:
   seorang guru            cf.      guru saya/itu
   a teacher                        my/that teacher
   dua ekor kuda           cf.      kedua kuda itu
   two horses                       those two horses
In journalistic style classifiers occasionally occur with a
proper noun, just as 'a' can in English:
   Sebuah Indonesia yang kuat dan dinamis penting untuk
   Asia Tenggara.
   A strong and dynamic Indonesia is important for
   Southeast Asia.
Generic nouns, such as ikan 'fish and burung 'bird', can take
                                   1a modifying noun (see 2.37) and be preceded by a classifier:
   seekor ikan hiu a shark
   seekor burung elang a hawk
2.22 There are a large number of classifiers, although
only the three already mentioned are common. The
following list is not exhaustive. There is some overlap in
function; for instance, helai, lembar and carik can all occur
with kertas 'paper :
                  1
  batang used with cylindrical objects such as pipes, tree
     trunks, cigarettes : Pak Trimo memiliki 25 batang
     pohon kelapa. Mr Trimo owns 25 coconut trees,
  bentuk used with round and curved objects : sebentuk
     cincin/gelang a ring/bangle,
  bidang used with flat, spread-out things : sebidang tanah
     a plot of land
  biji used with small, round objects such as soap, cakes,
     eggs, grains : dua biji telur two eggs
  bilah used with sharp things such as knives, needles :
     Nanda mengancam sopir dengan sebilah pisau. Nanda
     threatened the driver with a knife,
  carik used with paper : secarik kertas a piece of paper
  helai used with flat things like leaves, sheets : sehelai
     kertas a sheet of paper
  kaki used with umbrellas : sekaki payung an umbrella
  kuntum used with flowers : tiga kuntum bunga kemboja
     three frangipannis
  lembar used with flat things such as paper, sheets : dua
     lembar foto two photographs
  patah used with kata 'word' : susunan dua patah kata a
      sequence of two words
  pucuk used with guns and letters : sepucuk surat/bedil a
      letter/gun
  utas used with rope and thread : Dia mengikatkan seutas
     tali pada anjing. He tied a piece of rope to the dog.
2.23 With nouns which do not fit any of the above
categories buah generally occurs. As the classifiers listed
above are rarely used buah can replace some of them.
Alternatively, a classifier is omitted, indicated by parentheses
in the following examples:
   Tadi pagi saya menulis tiga (pucuk/buah) surat.
  - This morning I wrote three letters.
   Tangannya memegang (sepucuk/sebuah) pistol.
    His hand clutched a pistol.
There is an increasing tendency for sebuah to be used
with abstract nouns: sebuah pengamatan/rencana/
perdebatan 'an observation/plan/debate'. The function of*#
sebuah overlaps with that of suatu 'a', discussed in 2.114.
2.24 Classifiers can be preceded by some indefinite
numbers, including beberapa 'several', and the interrogative
number berapa 'how many?' (see 4.19):
   beberapa buah buku several books
   berapa biji sabun? how many cakes of soap?
2.25 Unlike other classifiers orang can occur without a
following head noun:
   Dia seorang yang jujur.
   He is an honest person.
If se- does not occur in such situations orang must be
regarded simply as the noun meaning 'person':
   Dia orang yang jujur.
   He's an honest person.
The classifier orang and the head noun orang are sometimes
used together, although many speakers avoid this
construction:
   Seorang orang Perancis diculik di Kamboja kemarin.
   A Frenchman was abducted in Cambodia yesterday.
2.26 The word belah 'half; one of something which
comes in a pair' is sometimes listed with classifiers. It is used
mainly with body parts which are in pairs: sebelah mata 'an
eye', dua belah tangan 'two/both hands' and for things like
shoes and ornaments worn one on each side of the body:
sebelah subang 'one ear ring'. Unlike classifiers, it can occur
with a definite noun, marked, for instance, by a possessive:
   Dia menutup mulutnya dengan kedua belah tangannya.
   She covered her mouth with both hands.
Partitives
2.27 Partitives indicate a particular amount of something.
They precede the head word, which can be either a count or a
non-count noun. Count nouns can alternatively be preceded
by a cardinal number or a number plus classifier but non-
count nouns cannot. To indicate singular se- 'one' precedes
the partitive. In some discussions of Indonesian grammar
partitives are confused with classifiers. However, there is a
clear distinction: classifiers group nouns on the basis of some
perceived intrinsic characteristic, while partitives group nouns
on the basis of how they are measured, assembled, or
processed. Thus, in sebatang rokok 'a cigarette', batang is a
classifier, marking rokok 'cigarette' as a member of the class
of cylindrical objects. In sebungkus rokok 'a packet of
cigarettes', bungkus is a partitive, identifying the quantity of
cigarettes according to the way they are packaged.
Unlike classifiers, which are always optional, partitives can
never be deleted without change of meaning. Thus, deletion
of batang in the following sentence results in no change in
meaning:
   Dia mengisap dua batang rokok.
   Dia mengisap dua rokok.
   He smoked two cigarettes.
On the other hand, deletion of the partitive bungkus results in
a sentence with a different meaning:
   Dia megisap dua bungkus rokok.
   He smoked two packets of cigarettes.
   Dia mengisap dua rokok.
   He smoked two cigarettes.
The number preceding a partitive can be a fraction; in the
following example setengah 'half precedes the partitive gelas
'glass (of)':
    Dia minum setengah gelas air.
    He drank half a glass of water.
2.28 Among partitives are containers; any noun
indicating something which can contain something else can
be used in this way:
   bakul basket : tiga bakul beras three baskets of rice
   botol bottle : sebotol bir a bottle of beer
   genggam handful : beberapa genggam nasi several
      handfuls of rice
   piring plate : sepiring nasi a plate of rice
   sendok spoon : dua sendok gula two spoons of sugar
   truk truck : dua truk pasir two truckloads of sand
2.29 Partitives include natural and artificial clusterings,
groupings and pieces of things, such as:
   bulir ear : sebulir padi an ear of rice
   gugus cluster : segugus bintang a cluster of stars
   gumpal clump, lump : segumpal tanah a clump of soil
   iris slice : dua iris mangga two slices of mango
   jenis kind, sort, species : sejenis burung a type/species of
       bird
   kawan herd, flock, gang : sekawan gajah a herd of
       elephants
   keping chip, fragment : sekeping kayu a splinter of wood
   macam kind, sort, type : semacam senjata a type of
       weapon
   potong piece, slice : sepotong roti a slice of bread
   rombongan group, party : serombongan gubernur a
       group of governors
   sikat hand, small bunch : dua sikat pisang two hands of
       bananas
   tandan bunch : setandan pisang a bunch of bananas
   tetes drop : setetes darah a drop of blood
   timbun pile : lima timbun pasir five piles of sand
With some members of this subgroup the partitive plus head
noun may be reinterpreted as head noun plus modifying
noun (see 2.37). In the above list tandan 'bunch is a   1partitive, while in the following sentence it is the head of a
noun phrase, occurring reduplicated and without a number, as
can other count nouns:
   Dia sedang menata tandan-tandan pisang dagangannya.
   She was arranging the banana bunches she had for sale.
Some other partitives in this group more commonly take
suffix -an if occurring as phrase heads (see 1.65).
2.30 Measurement nouns can act as partitives. A
measurement noun refers to size, distance, volume, speed,
weight or temperature:
   meter meter                   ton tonne
   kilometer kilometer            hektar hectare
   liter liter                    derajat degree
   kodi a score (for purchase of cloth)
   depa fathom, measure from finger tip to finger tip
   hasta cubit, measure from elbow to finger tip
Measurement nouns are always preceded by a number,
forming measurement noun phrases:
   dua kilometer two kilometers
   tiga seperempat ton three and a quarter tons
   dua puluh delapan derajat (selsius) twenty eight degrees
      (celsius)
   beberapa liter several liters
Measurement nouns referring to length, area, volume and
weight can occur in partitive constructions to indicate the
amount of something:
  sekilo beras a kilo of rice
  dua liter susu two liters of milk
  tiga puluh ribu hektar lahan thirty thousand hectares of
     land
  setengah meter rotan half a metre of cane
  dua kodi kain two kodi (= forty pieces) of cloth
Numbers, classifiers and partitives; further comments
2.31 Both classifiers and partitives can follow the head
noun:
   Dia mengimpor kursi sebanyak 8000 buah.
   He imported as many as 8000 chairs.
   Dia datang membawa susu dua gelas.
   She came with two glasses of milk.
   Ibu membeli beras dua kilo.
   Mother bought two kilos of rice.
2.32 Many classifiers and partitives are basically nouns
and can occur as heads of noun phrases. Words functioning
as classifiers sometimes have a different meaning when
fuhctioning as a head noun. Thus the classifiers ekor,
grouping animals, and buah, grouping inanimate things,
mean 'tail' and 'fruit' respectively when occurring as nouns:
   Ekor anjing ini panjang.
   This dog's tail is long.
   Buah pohon ini enak.
   The fruit of this tree is delicious.
AU partitives indicating containers (see 2.28) also occur as
full nouns:
   Botol ini retak*
   This bottle is cracked.
2.33 Group numbers and some partitives, including those
indicating containers (see 2.28), and measurement nouns (see
2.30), can be reduplicated and prefixed with ber- to indicate
an indefinite quantity (see also 1.161 and 1.162 for further
examples):
   berjuta-juta orang millions of people
   berliter-liter susu litres and litres of milk
   berbotol-botol bir bottles and bottles of beer
   bermacam-macam tanaman all sorts of plants
Diminutives and honorifics
2.34 These occur immediately before the head noun to
convey an attitude on the part of the speaker, usually of
affection or respect.
Si
2.35 This is a diminutive. It is used with the names of
children, emphasising their smallness or a feeling of affection
on the part of the speaker:
   si Ali Ali (a child)
Si can also be used with the names of animals, especially pets
or animals in folk stories. In this case it is a personifier as
well as diminutive:
   si Putih Whitey (name of an pet)
   si Kancil Mousedeer (character in folk stories)
It can occur with adjectives, usually those indicating physical
characteristics, turning the adjective into a proper noun while
still acting as a diminutive:
    si Botak Baldy                  si Gemuk Fatty
    si Tolol Dopey
The nominalised adjective may become a common noun, in
which case the diminutive sense is usually absent:
   Pembagian pangan yang tak merata membuat si gendut
   makin kaya, tanpa peduli nasib si miskin, yang hampir
   mati kelaparan.
   Unequal distribution of food makes the fat one
   increasingly rich, without caring about the fate of the poor
   one, who almost dies of hunger.
It also occurs with common nouns, most frequently those
formed with peN- (see 1.46). Here there is no diminutive
connotation:
   si pembawa resep
   the one who brought the prescription
   Si pengirim foto tidak menyebutkan namanya.
   The sender of the photos didn't mention his name.
Sang
2.36 This is an honorific. It shows that the person
referred to is someone held in high respect:
   sang Raja the King
   sang Presiden the President
Like si, it can occur with names of animals in folk tales. It
also occurs before the name of the Indonesian flag, thus
acting as a personifier as well as retaining its role as an
honorific:
   sang Harimau Tiger
   sang Merah Putih the Red and White (the Indonesian flag)
It can also be used facetiously or even sarcastically to indicate
the speaker's negative attitude towards someone who is
perhaps more highly regarded than he deserves:
    Sekitar tiga puluh tahun silam nama John Profumo
    melambung di media massa karena sang menteri terlibat
    skandal seks dengan seorang pelacur.
    About thirty years ago the name of John Profumo was
    prominent in the media because the esteemed minister was
    involved in a sex scandal with a prostitute.
Modifying nouns
2.37 A noun can be followed by another noun called a
modifying noun. A modifying noun gives more specific
information about the head noun. There is a wide range of
relationships between the two nouns. The modifying noun
can indicate what the head noun is made of, where it comes
from, what it is used for, what it does, where it is, what it is part
of, what sex it is, what process it has undergone, and so on.
The following examples illustrate a number of these
relationships:
   toko buku book shop
   guru bahasa language teacher
   sate ayam chicken sate
   buku sejarah history book
   pemain tenis tennis player
   ilmu kedokteran medical science
   mesin pendingin cooling machine
   tukang kayu carpenter (wood artisan)
   buku catatan note book
   anak perempuan girl (female child)
   orang Jepang Japanese (person)
   kapal Indonesia Indonesian ship
   kain batik batik cloth
   pinggir jalan edge of the road
Some modifying relationships occur only with action nouns;
these are discussed in section 2.53.
2.38 No other word can come between a head word and
following modifying nou:i. Any word following the
modifying noun refers to the head word and not to the
modifying noun:
   toko buku yang besar a big book shop
   guru sekolah itu that school teacher
An exception is that some modifying nouns can themselves
take a modifier. In the first example below the head of the
noun phrase is awak 'crew . The modifying noun bis 'bus'
                               1has its own modifying noun, kota 'city':
   awak bis kota city bus crew
   buku sejarah Indonesia Indonesian history book
   gelombang keresahan sosial a wave of social unrest
2.39 In some cases the modifying noun must itself be
modified, that is, the phrase would be incomplete if consisting
just of the head word and modifier. In such cases the
modifier is a peN- noun based on a transitive verb (see 1.46)
and its own modifier relates to the object of the
corresponding verb. The first example below relates to
Pasukan itu memelihara perdamaian 'Those troops keep the
peace ; pasukan pemelihara is not well-formed unless
     1pemelihara 'keeper, maintained has the modifier perdamaian
'peace . The modifier and its own modifier act as a
         1compound and are hyphenated in English equivalents:
   pasukan pemelihara perdamaian peace-keeping forces
   propinsi penghasil lada pepper-producing province
   kapal pembawa plutonium plutonium-carrying ship
   kunjungan pencari fakta fact-finding visit
Possessors
2.40 A possessor follows the head word. It can be a noun
or a pronoun:
   rumah Tomo Tomo's house
   nama negeri itu the name of that country
   mobil saya my car
Possessive pronouns are further discussed in section 2.72.
Possessive nouns differ from modifying nouns (see 2.37ff) in
that they can themselves be the head of a noun phrase. In the
following example the possessor, toko 'shop', is head of a
noun phrase which contains a modifier and demonstrative:
   nama toko buku itu the name of that book shop
As head of a noun phrase a possessive noun can also take a
possessor:
   kantor ayah saya my father's office
   mobil teman Marni Marni's friend's car
Out of context ambiguity may exist as to whether a noun is
modifying or possessive. Thus bis 'bus' is a modifier in the
first example below, describing what kind of driver Ali is, but
possessor in the second:
    Ali sopir bis.
    Ali is a bus driver.
    Sopir bis ini belum muncul.
    The driver of this bus hasn't turned up yet.
2.41 A possessive noun does not always identify the
owner of the head word; it may identify the originator, creator
or some other relationship. In the following phrase
sastrawan 'man of letters' is the writer of the novel, a
relationship sometimes indicated by 'by' in English:
    roman sastrawan ini the novel of/by this man of letters
2.42 Sometimes a possessor is optionally preceded by a
modifying noun (see 2.37) which specifies the particular
relationship between the possessor and head word. The
modifier is not obligatory to the construction. Thus, in buku
ciptaan Pak Sastro the modifier ciptaan 'creation specifies
                                                    1that Pak Sastro 'Mr Sastro' is the writer of the book rather
than the owner. However, the modifier could be omitted,
resulting in buku Pak Sastro 'Mr Sastro's book', although this
does not explicitly state whether he is writer or owner:
   buku ciptaan Pak Sastro
   Mr Sastro's book; the book written by Mr Sastro
   kios milik Pak Junus
   Mr Junus' kiosk; the kiosk owned by Mr Junus
   barang buatan Jepang
   Japanese goods; goods made in Japan
   partai pimpinan Hawke
   Hawke's party ; the party led by Hawke
2.43 A ligature dari 'of sometimes occurs between head
and possessive noun, although it cannot occur before a
possessive pronoun:
   rumah dari Bu Siti Mrs Siti's house
Use of dari before a possessor is regarded as substandard by
many people. However, it is frequently used if the head word
and possessor are the same or similar:
   guru dari guru saya
   my teacher's teacher
   lukisan dari pelukis-pelukis Italia
   paintings by Italian artists
2.44 Also occurring as a ligature before possessive nouns
is -nya:
    anaknya guru kami our teacher's child
In this context -nya carries no meaning other than to identify
the second noun as possessor. Its use is particularly common
among speakers of Javanese, in which a similar construction
occurs. It is likely to occur where a kin relationship would be
ambiguous. Thus Ibu Suparjo could mean 'Suparjo's mother      1or 'Mrs Suparjo'. With ligature -nya possession is the only
possible meaning:
   ibunya Suparjo Suparjo's mother
Adjectives in the noun phrase
2.45 An adjective immediately follows the phrase head:
   rumah besar a big house
Adjectives are frequently preceded by yang. The yang plus
adjective construction is actually an instance of a relative
clause (see 3.98). However, because of its frequency it
deserves separate treatment here.
A noun plus adjective sequence forms a close unit, expressing
a single idea without any emphasis on the adjective. Use of
yang separates the adjective from the noun and gives
emphasis to it. This occurs, for instance, when a contrast is
made:
   Mereka tinggal di rumah yang besar, bukan rumah
   yang kecil.
   They live in a big house, not a small house.
If a noun plus adjective sequence is a compound (see 1.32)
yang cannot occur:
   rumah sakit hospital
   imigran gelap illegal immigrant
Some noun plus adjective sequences are either compounds,
with idiomatic meaning, or genuine sequences, depending on
context. The combination can only be separated by yang if it
is not a compound. Thus:
   kamar kecil toilet; small room : kamar yang kecil small
       room
    orang tua parents; old people : orang yang tua old
       people
   meja hijau law court; green table : meja yang hijau
     green table
   kambing hitam scapegoat; black goat : kambing yang
     hitam black (coloured) goat
If more than one adjective occurs the first may form a close
unit with the noun while the second is preceded by yang:
   gadis kuno yang malu-malu
   a shy old-fashioned girl
   tubuh tua yang ringkih
   a frail old body
Coordinated adjectives must be preceded by yang:
  anak yang rajin dan pandai
  a hard-working and clever child
A sequence of more than two adjectives usually requires dan
'and only before the final adjective:
    1   wanita yang cantik, periang dan cerdas
   a woman who is beautiful, cheerful and intelligent
Yang is obligatory before an adjective phrase (see 2.99ff)
within the noun phrase except that it need not occur before a
superlative adjective phrase with paling or ter- 'most':
   gempa bumi terburuk di daerah ini
   the worst earthquake in this district
   kelompok paling kuat
   the strongest group
With other adjective phrases yang is obligatory:
  jas yang terlalu besar
  a jacket which is too big
  orang yang lebih kaya
  richer people
As yang actually introduces a relative clause, predicate
elements (see 2.132ff) such as negative and temporal markers
can precede the adjective:
   pakaian yang tidak mahal
   clothes which aren't expensive
   orang yang sudah cape
   people who are already tired
Modifying verbs
2.46 A modifying verb immediately follows the head
noun and describes what the noun is used for. Verbal affixes
are usually lost:
   kamar tidur bedroom
   kamar mandi bathroom
   meja tulis desk, writing table
   mesin ketik typewriter
   ruang tunggu waiting room
   lapangan terbang aerodrome
Some people retain prefix ber- on a modifying verb; others
regard this as incorrect:
   kolam renang/berenang swimming pool
   tempat kerja/bekerja work place
Some modifying verbs indicate the process the noun
undergoes:
  nasi goreng fried rice
  ubi rebus boiled cassava
Attributive verbs
2.47 The relationship between the head noun and
attributive verb is that of subject and verb in a clause.
Attributive verbs differ from relative clauses (see 3.98) in two
ways.
First, yang does not precede the verb. Secondly, the
attributive verb, unlike the verb in a relative clause, cannot be
expanded by other clause components, except as indicated
below. Attributive verbs are usually ber- verbs with a noun
base (see 1.169ff). These refer to states or permanent
conditions, not to actions:
    kendaraan bermotor motor vehicle
    sayur-sayuran bergizi nutritious vegetables
    perampok bersenjata armed robbers
Some attributive verbs have compound noun bases consisting
of a head noun and a following adjective or number (see
L176):
   pesawat berbadan lebar a wide-bodied plane
   gedung bertingkat tiga a three-storey building
   bocah berusia sembilan tahun a nine year old boy
The noun which forms the base of the attributive verb may be
modified by another noun:
  rumah beratap seng a tin-roofed house
  kapal berbendera Amerika a ship with an American flag
  listrik bertenaga surya solar-powered electricity
The attributive verb may have a noun complement (see 3.64):
  pemuda bernama Gaston a youth named Gaston
  buku berjudul ""Rajiv"" a book entitled ""Rajiv""
Stative ter- verbs (see 1.266) can also occur in attributive
position:
   ujian tertulis written exam
   wawancara terpisah separate interviews
Some more or less set expressions also occur attributive to a
noun, such as tak dikenal 'unidentified and tak berdosa
                                          1'innocent :
         1    Rumahnya dirampas oleh dua orang tak dikenal*
   His house was robbed by two unidentified people,
   bayi tak berdosa
   an innocent baby
An attributive verb can always be preceded by yang; in this
case, however, it becomes a relative clause (see 3.98) and is
capable of all the expansion that can occur in such a clause.
Relative clauses in the noun phrase
2.48 One way of adding information about a noun is by
placing a clause within the noun phrase; this is called a
relative clause. A relative clause is always preceded by yang.
Relative clauses containing an adjective are discussed in
section 2.45 and other relative clauses in 3.97ff.
Adjuncts in the noun phrase
2.49 Adjuncts are discussed in sections 2.165-215. Some
adjuncts can occur within noun phrases, including adverbs of
manner (see 2.166), prepositional phrases (see 2.118ff) and
adjuncts of time (see 2.182).
Adverbs of manner which can occur in a noun phrase include
begini, semacam ini, seperti ini 'like this , begitu, demikian,
                                          1sedemikian, seperti itu 'like that :
                                1   bioskop seperti ini a cinema like this
   pikiran begitu thoughts like that
A variety of prepositional phrases can occur in the noun
phrase, of which the following are a few examples:
   petani dari Aceh
   a farmer from Aceh
   dongeng tentang seorang haji
   a story about a haji
   uang untuk pondokan
   money for boarding
   pertemuan antara kedua pemimpin itu
   a meeting between the two leaders
   serangan dengan batu bata
   an attack with bricks
Adjuncts of time are illustrated by the following:
  pesta kemarin the party yesterday
  pengumuman tadi malam the announcement last night
Functions of -nya in the noun phrase
2.50 This suffix has several functions within the noun
phrase. It can function as a third person possessive pronoun
(see -2.72), or as a ligature before a possessive noun (see
2.44).
It can also occur attached to the head noun, being translated
'the . This can occur where the noun has not before been
   1mentioned but is understood within the context of the
utterance. Where a thing or person has recently been
mentioned itu must be used in the repetition (see 2.9). The
different distributions of itu and -nya are shown by the
following sentences:  1    Ibu sudah memasak nasi. Nasi itu di lemari.
   Mother has cooked rice. It is in the pantry, (literally: That
   rice is in the pantry.)
   Kalau mau makan, nasinya di lemari.
   If you want to eat, the rice is in the pantry.
In the first sentence above nasi itu 'that rice' refers to the rice
already mentioned. (The English translation has 'it', which
has no equivalent in Indonesian - see 2.73-4.) As nasi is not
mentioned previously in the second example, itu is not
possible. However, when reference is made to eating in
Indonesia rice is understood, and thus -nya can occur. In the
following examples perawatnya 'the nurse' and airnya 'the
water' are possible because nurses are assumed in the context
of a hospital and water is necessary for bathing:
   Ia menilai pelayanan di rumah sakit cukup baik.
   ""Begitu dibel, perawatnya langsung datang"", katanya.
   He regards service in the hospital as very good. ""No
   sooner is she called than the nurse immediately comes,"" he
   said.
   Saya ingin mandi, tetapi airnya tidak ada.
   I wanted to have a bath but there wasn't any water.
In the following examples the first sentence assumes a dog is
kept in the house, the second presupposes a newspaper is
delivered, while in the third it is understood that there is a way
to the post office:
    Apa anjingnya sudah diberi makan?
   Has the dog been fed?
   Di mana korannya?
   Where is the newspaper?
   Saya mau ke kantor pos tapi tidak tahu jalannya.
    I want to go to the post office but I don't know the way.
Use of -nya in this way is optional; it tends to be used by
Indonesians whose regional language has a similar
construction.
      This example is taken from McGarry and Sumaryono, book 3
      (1974: 42).
Reflexive sendiri
2.51 The reflexive sendiri 'self occurs with nouns and
pronouns (see 2.81) to emphasise or make clear who or what
is being referred to:
    Ibu sendiri yang memasak kue ini*
   It was mother herself who made this cake.
   Buku ini ditulis oleh Pak Bambang sendiri.
   This book was written by Mr Bambang himself.
Sendiri is frequently, though optionally, separated from a
subject noun phrase and placed after the verb or after the
object of the verb (as also occurs in English):
   Dia sendiri datang/Dia datang sendiri.
   He came himself.
   Kami sendiri membangun rumah ini/Kami membangun
   rumah ini sendiri.
   We built this house ourselves.
Colloquially sendiri is often used after the verb instead of
sendirian, seorang diri 'alone, by oneself (see 2.178).
Following a possessive noun or pronoun sendiri translates
'own':
   Sayur-sayuran ini dari kebun ibu sendiri.
   These vegetables are from mother's own garden.
   Budi harus membayar dari kantongnya sendiri.
   Budi must pay from his own pocket.
Some people allow a possessive to be ellipted (see 4.111)
before sendiri if the person it refers to has recently been
mentioned. In the following example -nya is ellipted:
   Nelayan merasa di laut seperti di rumah sendiri.
   When they are at sea the fishermen feel as if in their own
   home.
Sendiri also occurs in reflexive phrases (see 2.162).
Lain and lainnya in the noun phrase
2.52 Following a noun both lain and lainnya translate
'other, another'. However, they have different meanings.
Lain means 'other' in a contrastive sense. That is, 'other,
something or someone different':
   Kita harus menghormati hak orang lain.
  We must respect the rights of other people.
Lainnya means 'other' in the sense of 'something extra,
something or someone in addition':
  Selama di Amerika dia disertai isterinya, anak-anaknya
  dan beberapa orang lainnya.
  While in America he was accompanied by his wife, his
  children and several other people.
Both lain and lainnya can be preceded by yang, in which
case they are treated as relative clauses (see 3.98).
Attributive nouns in action noun phrases
2.53 Action nouns can be followed by attributive nouns,
which do not occur in other types of noun phrase. While
these attributives bear a relationship to possessive nouns they
require special treatment. They differ from modifying nouns
(2.37) in that they can themselves be full noun phrases and
can be preceded by a preposition.
Action nouns usually have affixation peN-...-an (see 1.87)
but some have -an (see 1.62) and some have other affixes or
are affixless. An action noun always relates to the meaning of
a transitive verb; thus pembunuhan 'killing, murder' relates to
membunuh 'kill'.
The attributive noun can relate to the head noun as either
actor or patient of the corresponding verb (for a discussion of
'actor' and 'patient' see section 3.17). The relationship may be
ambiguous:
    pembunuhan pemilik toko
    the killing of the shop keeper
Here it is not clear (out of context) whether the shop keeper
performs the action (the actor) or is affected by the action
(the patient). Thus the above phrase may derive from either
of the following constructions:
   Pemilik toko membunuh.
   The shop keeper killed (someone).
   Pemilik toko dibunuh.
   The shop keeper was killed (by someone).
Frequently the relationship is made clear by use of oleh 'by'
before an actor attributive and by a preposition, usually
terhadap 'of, toward', before a patient attributive:
   pembunuhan oleh pemilik toko
   the killing by the shop keeper
   pembunuhan terhadap pemilik toko
   the killing of the shop owner (by someone)
Attributives relating to the head noun as actor and patient can
occur together, in which case the second requires a
preposition. Their relative ordering is free:
   penuduhan lurah oleh bupati
   the accusation of the village head by the bupati
   penuduhan lurah terhadap bupati
   the village head's accusation of the bupati
The first phrase above relates to Lurah dituduh oleh bupati
'The village head was accused by the bupati\ and the second
relates to Lurah menuduh bupati 'The village head accused
the bupati\
A preposition may occur before each of the attributives:
   pemukulan terhadap pengemudi sepeda motor oleh
   seorang polisi
   the beating of a motor cyclist by a policeman
The following examples illustrate occurrence of attributive
nouns with action nouns which do not have affix peN-.~-an:
   kecaman keras negara-negara itu terhadap Iran
   the strong criticism by those countries of Iran
   serangan oleh seorang gerilya
   an attack by a guerrilla
   eksploitasi negara-negara kaya terhadap negara-negara
  miskin
   exploitation by wealthy countries of poor countries
Several other prepositions can replace terhadap as marker of
the patient attributive, of which atas is the most frequent.
Dari also occurs:
   pemboman atas kota itu
   the bombing of that city
   pengangkutan olehnya dari barang ini
   the transporting by him of these goods
Bahwa and supaya/agar complements in noun phrases
2.54 Some nouns can take a complement introduced by
bahwa 'that (see 3.108) or supaya/agar '(so) that' (see
             13.119):
   laporan-laporan bahwa kegiatan tersebut telah berhenti
   reports that those activities have ceased
   seruan agar perdamaian tercipta
   an appeal that peace be achieved
Such complements occur with nouns which correspond to
verbs which can take the same complements. Thus the phrase
laporan bahwa..* 'the report that...' is based on (Dia)
melaporkan bahwa... '(He) reported that../; the phrase
seruan agar ... 'an appeal (so) that ...' is based on (Dia)
berseru agar ... '(He) appealed that...'.
Word order within the noun phrase
2.55 This discussion is restricted to the relative ordering
of certain constituents of the noun phrase which occur after
the head noun: modifying nouns, adjectives, possessors,
relative clauses, attributive nouns- and demonstratives.
2.56 A modifying noun directly follows the head,
preceding all other post-head elements including adjectives
and possessors:
   toko buku besar
   a big book shop
   guru bahasa saya
   my language teacher
2.57 A possessor follows an adjective:
   sikap tegas bapak
   father's firm attitude
   galangan kapal terbesar Korea Selatan
   South Korea's largest shipyard
2*58 Attributive nouns in action noun phrases also follow
adjectives:
   kecaman keras negara-negara itu terhadap Iran
   the harsh criticism of Iran by those countries
2.59 Relative clauses follow modifying nouns, adjectives
and possessors:
   sandiwara baru Pak Djoko yang dipentaskan tadi
   malam
   Mr Djoko's new play which was staged last night
An adjective preceded by yang is a relative clause (see 3.98).
In this case it follows a possessor, whereas without yang it
precedes the possessor, as in 2.57:
   sikap bapak yang tegas
   father's firm attitude
2.60 The demonstratives follow all other constituents of
the phrase. In the following example the demonstrative
follows an adjective and possessor:
   baju merah saya ini
   this red shirt of mine
The presence of a demonstrative thus marks the end of a
noun phrase. The first construction below is a noun phrase
ending in itu, the second is a clause in which the subject noun
phrase ends in itu and is followed by an adjective predicate,
the third construction is also a clause in which the subject is
itu (see 2.65) and the predicate is a noun phrase:
   rumah besar itu
   that big house
   Rumah itu besar.
   That house is big.
   Itu rumah besar.
   That is a big house.
Structural ambiguity may occur if there is more than one
noun preceding a demonstrative. In the following phrase
nelayan 'fisherman' is either a modifying noun describing
what sort of house is being referred to, in which case ini refers
to the head word rumah 'house' (because a modifying noun
cannot usually be the head of a phrase - see 231 if), or it is a
possessor, specifying the owner of the house, in which case ini
refers to nelayan:
   rumah nelayan ini
   this fisherman's house
   or the house of this fisherman
In the following example itu may refer to the head word,
tuduhan itu 'those charges', or to the attributive, Robert itu
'that (person) Robert' (demonstratives can follow proper
nouns - see 2.7):
    tuduhan terhadap Robert itu
   those charges against Robert
   or the charges against that (person) Robert
Ambiguity may result when a demonstrative follows a relative
clause ending in a noun; the demonstrative may refer to the
head word or it may be part of the noun phrase within the
relative clause, referring to the final noun of the relative
clause. Thus the following example may be interpreted as
containing anak ... itu 'that child' or ... sepeda itu 'that
bicycle':
   Anak yang naik sepeda itu tinggal dekat saya*
   That child riding a bike lives near me.
   or The child riding that bike lives near me.
Although it is widely regarded as unacceptable, itu sometimes
occurs before a relative clause in journalistic style, especially
if the relative clause is long. Most people would place itu at
the end of the subject noun phrase, after aktivis, in the
following sentence:
    Kapal carteran itu, yang mengangkut para pelajar dan
    kaum aktivis, kembali menuju Darwin.
    The charter boat, which was transporting the students and
    activists, turned back to Darwin.","[157, 158, 159, 160, 161, 162, 163, 164, 165, 166, 167, 168, 169, 170, 171, 172, 173, 174, 175, 176, 177, 178, 179, 180, 181, 182, 183, 184, 185]"
"
      This was pointed out by Hein Steinhauer in a personal
      communication.
A number of benefactive verbs, such those in the above
examples, have English equivalents which also allow the
beneficiary to be expressed as the object. Some others are:
   membuatkan make (for)
   membelikan buy (for)
   memilihkan choose (for)
   memasakkan cook (for)
   memesankan order (for)
For a number of other benefactive verbs the corresponding
English verb does not allow a benefactive object, as with
membawakan 'carry', whose English translation requires the
beneficiary to be expressed by a phrase beginning with 'for':
   Sopir membawakan saya koper yang berat
   The driver carried the heavy cases for me.
Some other verbs whose English translation does not allow a
benefactive object are:
   mencucikan wash (for)
   membukakan open (for)
   mengangkatkan lift (for)
   mencarikan seek (for), look for (for)
   menutupkan close/cover (for)
The verb menuliskan has a benefactive object. The English
equivalent does not allow a benefactive object but instead
allows an object indicating the person to whom the letter is
sent, the recipient; in Indonesian this participant must be
expressed by a phrase with kepada :
   Dia menuliskan ayahnya surat
   He wrote a letter for his father.
   Dia menulis surat kepada ayahnya.
   He wrote his father a letter/He wrote a letter to his father.
All verbs which can take benefactive -kan can also occur
without the suffix. However, if it does not occur the object
must be the patient and the beneficiary must be expressed by
a phrase beginning with untuk, buat or bagi Tor':
   Pelayan mengambil segelas air untuk tamu.
   The waiter fetched a glass of water for the guest.
When benefactive -kan does occur it signals that the action is
done for someone's benefit even if that person is not
mentioned. Thus:
  Pelayan mengambilkan segelas air.
  The waiter fetched (someone) a glass of water.
Such constructions are common in contexts where it is clear
for whose benefit the action is performed. Perhaps because
of such constructions forms with benefactive -kan and a
beneficiary expressed in a prepositional phrase beginning
with untuk, buat or bagi have developed in modern
Indonesian :7   Pelayan mengambilkan segelas air untuk tamu.
   The waiter fetched a glass of water for the guest.
   Aku membelikan bermacam-macam perhiasan untuk
   isteriku.
   I bought lots of jewelry for my wife.
1.207 Many verbs cannot take benefactive -kan. These
includes all verbs with which -kan is required to produce a
well-formed transitive verb, such as discussed in section 1.190,
and to form causative verbs, discussed in 1.191 ff. Verbs
which describe actions which are not normally done for
someone else, such as makan 'eat', also cannot take
benefactive -kan.
With these verbs the beneficiary must be expressed in a
beneficiary phrase (see 2.211). In the following example
tamu 'guest cannot occur as object because base beres 'in
                1order' must take -kan to form a causative verb (see 1.192);
therefore -kan cannot occur with this verb to indicate that the
object is the beneficiary:
    Ibu membereskan kamar untuk tamu.
  - Mother arranged the room for the guest.
      While such constructions are common in modern Indonesian and
      generally considered well formed, some people regard them as sub-
      standard, resulting either from analogy with constructions in which
      the beneficiary is not expressed, or confusion with constructions in
      which -kan has a non-benefactive function (see Samsuri 1981: 8),
      or from interference from Javanese (see Verhaar 1984: 36-7) Johns
      (1978: 226) states that -kan must drop in such constructions.
Suffix -kan with two functions
1.208 If a transitive verb can occur without a suffix the
possibility exists for it to add -kan to indicate that someone
else is caused to do the action (see 1.19Iff) or to mark the
object as instrument (see 1.205) or beneficiary (see 1.206).
Thus menjahit 'sew allows the addition of -kan to show that
                    1the subject gets someone else to perform the action or that the
subject performs the action for someone else's benefit:
   Saya menjahitkan kemeja ke tukang jahit.
   I had my shirt sewn by that tailor.
   Tukang jahit itu menjahitkan saya kemeja baru.
   That tailor sewed me a new shirt.
Other verbs which allow the addition of -kan with these two
functions include:
   mencuci wash
   menimbang weigh
   memeriksa inspect, check
   memikul bear, carry on the shoulder
The verb menulis 'write' allows -kan with both instrumental
and benefactive meanings:
   Dia menuliskan pensil tumpul.
   He wrote with a blunt pen.
   Dia menuliskan ayahnya surat.
   He wrote a letter for his father.
Other verbs which allow -kan with these two functions
include:
   membelikan buy with (money); buy for (someone)
   memotongkan chop with (something); chop for
      (someone)
   membalutkan wrap with (something); wrap for (someone)
Other functions of rkan
1.209 Sometimes meanings occur in addition to those
noted above. Thus, in addition to meaning 'read for
someone', membacakan can mean 'read aloud, recite':
membacakan puisi 'recite poetry'. As well as meaning 'carry
for someone' membawakan can mean 'convey, present,
perform : membawakan lagu 'present a song'. As well as the
       1
two meanings given above, menuliskan can mean 'write
down': menuliskan pikiran 'write down (one's) thoughts'.
Some other simple transitive verbs which can add -kan to
form a verb whose meaning cannot be put into any of the
above categories include:
   melukis paint : melukiskan describe
   mendapat get : mendapatkan discover, obtain
   mendengar hear : mendengarkan listen to
   menunjuk point to : menunjukkan indicate
Optional-kan
1.210 With a number of words -kan can be omitted without
change of meaning. Most, though not all, such verbs are in
the group in 1.190 above. Thus, both mengantar and
mengantarkan mean 'accompany':
   Utomo mengantar/mengantarkan ibunya ke pasar.
   Utomo accompanied his mother to the market.
In the following examples optional -kan is indicated in
parentheses:
   melempar(kan) throw mengirim(kan) send
   menanam(kan) plant     merusak(kan) damage
   menuang(kan) pour      menyebut(kan) mention
   memberi(kan) give      menitip(kan) entrust
   menyumbang(kan) contribute
   mengantar(kan) accompany
In a few cases the optionality of -kan is different in active and
passive voice. This is discussed in section 3.35.
Transitive verbs with suffix -i
1.211 Suffix -i has two major functions: to indicate that the
object is the location of the action and to indicate repeated
action. When suffix -i occurs with a base ending in i the
sounds merge into one: beri + -i —> beri.
Locative -/
1.212 The most common function of -i is to indicate that
the object is the place where the action occurs or the person
or place to which the action is directed. When the action is
directed at a person that participant is called the recipient;
when it is located at or directed at a place that participant is
the location. Both these participants are referred to as
location if there is no need to distinguish them. These
participant roles are further discussed in section 3.17.
1.213 Many -i locative verbs have noun bases. The largest
group of these mean 'apply or give [base] to the object'.
Thus, in the examples below menandatangani 'sign' means
that the base tandatangan 'signature' is applied to the object
surat 'letter' and menghormati 'honour' means that the base
hormat 'honour' is applied to the object orang tua 'parents':
   Dia menandatangani surat.
   She signed the letter.
   Kita harus menghormati orang tua kita.
   We must honour/respect our parents.
Other verbs with noun bases and suffix -i with this function
include:
   mengilhami inspire         mewawancarai interview
   melukai wound              menangani tackle, handle
   meracuni poison            mengampuni forgive
   meminyaki oil              mempengaruhi influence
   mengakhiri end             mengipasi fan
   membatasi limit            menggarami salt
   membanjiri flood           meludahi spit on
   menasihati advise          menamai name
   memagari fence             mewarnai colour
   merestui bless             membohongi lie to
   mengisi fill               menilai evaluate
   menghargai appreciate, respect
   mengobati apply medicine to, treat
In a few cases the verb means that what is expressed by the
base is removed from the object rather than applied to it.
This is also generally the case with English equivalents of
such verbs:
   menyisiki scale (fish)
   menguliti skin, peel
   mengutui delouse, remove lice
   menulangi remove bones
   membului pluck, remove feathers
   merumputi weed, remove weeds
In both English and Indonesian removal, rather than addition,
is meant when removal is the action typically applied to the
object. However, in specific contexts addition may be
indicated by the same verbs. Thus, in the expression
menguliti buku 'cover a book', the verb menguliti indicates
the addition of something rather than the removal of
something, as does membului in membului anak panah
'feather an arrow'.
1.214 Another major group of -i verbs with noun bases
mean 'act as/be [base] with reference to object'. Thus in the
examples below Pak Irwan acts as sutradara 'director' of the
movie and Agassi is juara 'champion' of the tennis
tournament:
   Pak Irwan menyutradarai film itu.
   Mr Irwan directed that movie.
   Petenis Amerika Agassi menjuarai turnamen tenis itu.
   The American tennis player Agassi won the tennis
   tournament.
Other verbs with noun bases and suffix -i with this function
include:
   mengetuai chair (meeting)
   membintangi star (in movie)
   mensponsori sponsor
   mengepalai head, lead
   mewakili represent
   merajai rule (over)
   membuntuti trail after
   melandasi underly, be the base for
   mengawali precede
  - memusuhi treat with hostility
   mendalangi mastermind, manipulate
1.215 Suffix -i occurs with a limited number of adjective
bases. Most of these bases also occur with causative -kan (see
1.192). The -i form usually indicates that something is
applied to the object; it thus has a locative rather than
causative meaning. So memanasi (air) 'heat (water) by
applying heat to it , memanaskan (air) 'heat (water), for
                    1instance, by moving it into the heat ; mengasini (ikan) 'salt
                                     1(fish) by adding salt to it', mengasinkan (ikan) 'salt fish, for
instance, by placing it in salt water'; memerahi (bibir) 'redden
(lips) by applying something red to them', memerahkan
'redden by any means'; mengeringi (sawah) 'dry (rice field)
by draining water from it', mengeringkan 'dry, for instance,
by putting out in sun'.
Other verbs in this group include:
   membasahi wet, dampen
   memberati weigh down
   memenuhi fill, fulfill
   mencemari pollute, contaminate
   menelanjangi uncover (secret); strip
   menerangi light, illuminate
  menghitami blacken
  mengotori dirty, befoul
  mengurangi reduce
1.216 A few -i verbs based on adjectives have somewhat
different meanings, where the function of -i is not easily
distinguished from that of -kan, including:
   melengkapi complete
   mendalami deepen
   menghabisi finish off
   mengurangi reduce
1.217 With bases which indicate approximation or relative
position the -i verb means 'become the distance indicated by
the base from the object'. Thus menjauhi 'avoid' means
'become jauh (far) from'. Bases are from a number of word
classes, including some locative nouns (see 2.120); thus
membawahi 'be underneath', from bawah 'underneath':
   melalui pass (lalu past)
   melampaui pass by, exceed (lampau past)
   membawahi be underneath (bawah underneath)
   mendampingi flank, stand beside (damping close)
   mendekati approach (dekat near)
   menengahi intervene; mediate (tengah middle)
   menghampiri approach (hampir near)
   menjauhi avoid (jauh far)
1.218 A large number of -i verbs have verbal bases and
objects which indicate location. These verbs have intransitive
counterparts, as in the following examples:
   berbohong lie : membohongi lie to
   berkerumun swarm : mengerumuni swarm over
   datang come : mendatangi visit, come to
   duduk sit : menduduki sit on, occupy
   hadir be present : menghadiri attend
   jatuh fall : menjatuhi fall on
   melangkah step : melangkahi step over
   melompat jump : melompati jump over
   menangis weep : menangisi weep over
   menikah get married : menikahi marry (someone)
   percaya believe : mempercayai trust, believe
   tidur sleep : meniduri sleep on
1.219 Intransitive verbs such as those in the list in section
1.218 may take a prepositional phrase to indicate place,
means and so on (see 2.130), in which case the intransitive
verb plus preposition usually means the same as, or
something very similar to, the corresponding transitive verb:
   Mereka hadir (di rapat itu).
   They were present (at the meeting).
   Mereka menghadiri rapat itu.
   They attended that meeting.
   Dia sudah menikah (dengan gadis itu).
   He has married (that girl).
   Dia sudah menikahi gadis itu.
   He has married that girl.
For some of these intransitive verbs a prepositional phrase is
obligatory, as with tinggal di 'dwell in , the intransitive verb
                                         1and preposition corresponding in function to the -i verb.
Among verbs typically behaving like this are the emotives,
those which express emotions directed towards someone or
something, such as cinta 'love (prepositions following such
                                1intransitive verbs are variable, as discussed in section 2.130):
    Siapa yang tinggal di rumah ini?
    Siapa yang meninggali rumah ini?
   Who lives in this house?
   Pak Basri cinta akan istrinya.
   Pak Basri mencintai istrinya.
   Mr Basri loves his wife.
The following list exemplifies intransitive verbs which rarely
occur without a following preposition, together with their
transitive -i counterparts. Typical prepositions are also given.
With a few verbs prepositions are optional, as indicated by
parentheses:
   benci akan : membenci hate
   gemar akan : menggemari be fond of
   masuk (ke dalam) enter : memasuki enter
   sadar akan : menyadari be aware of
   suka (akan) : menyukai like
   tahu (akan) : mengetahui know
   bertemu dengan : menemui meet
   berkunjung ke : mengunjungi visit
   berdiam di : mendiami dwell in
   menyusup ke : menyusupi infiltrate
In a few cases there is some difference in meaning between
the intransitive verb plus preposition and the corresponding -i
verb:
   marah pada angry at : memarahi scold
   setuju dengan agree with (person or action) : menyetujui
      agree with, approve (action)
1.220 All the -i verbs with verbal bases discussed in section
 1.219 relate to intransitive verbs with a following preposition.
However, not all -i verbs with verbal bases correspond to
intransitive verbs in this way. Relating to some -i verbs are
intransitive verbs which are reflexive, such as menyerah
'surrender (oneself)', menyerahi 'hand over to, entrust to'.
For others there is no corresponding intransitive verb. Some
-i verbs relate to transitive simple verbs. Thus menulis 'write',
menulisi (kertas) 'write on (paper)'. Among verbs which do
not correspond in meaning to an intransitive verb plus
preposition are:
    melayani serve
    mengulangi repeat
   mempunyai have, possess
   merintangi block, hamper
   menaburi sprinkle
   menyelidiki investigate
   mengolesi smear
   menutupi cover
   menghalangi prevent, hamper
1.221 Another group of -i verbs are those sometimes called
ditransitive verbs, which are further discussed in section 3.20.
These verbs have a primary object and a secondary object.
With ditransitive -i verbs the primary object represents the
recipient of the action, that is, the one at whom the action is
directed, and the secondary object represents the patient. This
group is exemplified by mengirimi 'send to' and menyerahi
'hand over to':
    Ayah mengirimi saya uang.
    Father sent me money.
    Kepala kantor menyerahi kami tugas yang berat.
    The office head assigned us a heavy task.
Almost all these verbs have counterparts with suffix -kan, with
which the object represents the patient (see 1.190ff). A
number of verbs with noun bases are also ditransitive and can
be placed in this group, such as menghadiahi 'give to (object)
as a hadiah (gift)'. Some verbs in this group are given below,
along with typical primary and secondary objects:
   memberi (dia uang) give (him money)
   menawari (dia pekerjaan) offer (him a job)
   menamai (dia Ali) name (him Ali)
   menyuguhi (tamu minuman) offer (the guests a drink)
   melimpahi (dia harta) give (him wealth) in abundance
   menghadiahi (dia buku) give (him a book) as a gift
   menganugerahi (mereka seorang putri) bless (them with
      a daughter)
   meminjami (dia buku) lend (him a book)
   menyodori (dia buku) hand (him a book)
   mencurahi (dia kekayaan) bestow upon (him wealth)
1.222 There are many other -i verbs which are not
ditransitive but which nevertheless have counterparts with
-kan. The participant which is object with the -kan verb
occurs in a dengan phrase with the -i verb. (The relationship
between -i and -kan verbs is further discussed in 1.229ff.)
The following exemplify such -i verbs in sentences:
   Dia menanami sawahnya dengan padi.
   He planted his field with rice.
   Para demonstran melempari wartawan dengan batu.
   The demonstrators pelted the journalists with stones.
The prepositional phrase in such constructions is optional:
  Dia menanami sawahnya.
  He planted his field.
Some other verbs in this group are given below, with typical
objects and dengan phrases:
   menyirami (bunga dengan air) spray (flowers with water)
   mengolesi (badan dengan minyak) smear (body with oil)
   melayani (tamu dengan makanan) serve (guest with
      food)
   memuati (truk dengan batu bara) load (truck with coal)
   membebani (orang dengan tugas) burden (person with
      duty)
   menaburi (makanan dengan garam) sprinkle (food with
      salt)
   menghiasi (kamar dengan mawar) decorate (room with
      roses)
   membanjiri (negeri itu dengan uang) flood (the country
      with money)
   menutupi (mata dengan tangan) cover (eyes with hand)
   menulisi (kertas dengan pena) write on (paper with pen)
English verbs translating -i locative verbs usually allow the
same object, as in the above examples, although with a few
verbs the Indonesian must be paraphrased or a different verb
chosen. For instance, melampiri 'enclose can take surat
                                              1'letter' as object where the corresponding English verb cannot;
the English verb 'enclose' requires a patient as object and thus
is actually a translation of the corresponding -kan verb:
    Ayah melampiri surat dengan kwitansi.
    Father enclosed a receipt in the letter.
Other verbs which must be translated into English by a
paraphrase include:
   menghujani (musuh dengan bom) rain on (enemy with
      bombs)
   menuangi (cangkir dengan teh) pour into (cup with tea)
The preposition dengan 'with' can be omitted under certain
circumstances in a passive construction (see 3.37).
Verbs with and without -/
1.223 Some verbs occur in simple transitive form or with
suffix -i with different meanings. Besides those differences
which can be accounted for in terms of the regular functions
of -i, such as menulis 'write , menulisi 'write on', are
                                1differences in meaning which are restricted to particular verbs
and are usually unpredictable, such as:
   meliput cover an event (of a journalist) : meliputi cover
   mendapat get : mendapati find
   menunggu wait (for) : menunggui watch over
   mengenal know : mengenali recognise, identify
   mengajar teach : mengajari teach, train, coach
   mengurus arrange, organise : mengurusi look after
Optional -/
1.224 With a number of words locative -i can be omitted
without change of meaning. Thus both menyeberang and
menyeberangi mean 'cross over':
   Kita bisa menyeberang/menyeberangi jalan di sini.
   We can cross the road here.
In the following examples optional -i is indicated in
parentheses:
   menyiram(i) spray
   menghias(i) decorate
   mengikut(i) follow, obey
   menerobos(i) break through
   menggunjing(i) speak badly of
   mendamprat(i) abuse, insult
   mengiring(i) accompany
   menurut(i) follow
   menyuluh(i) light, illuminate
   mencicip(i) nibble
There is a considerable amount of variation in what different
speakers regard as acceptable. Thus some allow mengirim
instead of mengirimi 'send (someone something)', while
others regard -i as obligatory. Also, the frequency with
                                  8which -i occurs when it is optional varies from word to word.
For some speakers addition of -i to some words changes their
meaning while for others the suffix is optional and does not
change the meaning. Thus, some people distinguish
mengajar (mereka) 'teach (them)' and mengajari (mereka)
'train (them)'; others treat this as simply a case of optional -i.
Some people distinguish intransitive menyeberang 'cross
over' and transitive menyeberangi, although other
Indonesians treat the -i as optional before an object (but
obligatorily absent if there is no object - see 3.21).
Locative verbs without -/
1.225 A number of verbs occur as simple transitives where
-i might be expected because the object is locative. Thus
menyumbang has a locative object, this participant being
marked by kepada with the corresponding -kan verb:
   Kami menyumbang mereka dengan uang.
   We support them with money.
   Kami menyumbangkan uang kepada mereka.
   We contribute money to them.
Some verbs in this group have -kan counterparts with
'instrumental' meaning (see 1.205). Some others have noun
bases (see 1.188). Among these verbs are:
    mengetuk (pintu) knock on (door)
    menyemprot spray
    menambah (pengetahuan) add to (knowledge)
    menyemir polish
    mengingat remember
    memborgol handcuff
     Thus Dardjowidjojo (1978: 352) allows both Saya mengirimi
     mereka uang saku and Saya mengirim mereka uang saku 'l
     send them pocket money', while Johns (1978: 232) treats -i as
     obligatory in Paman mengirimi saya uang tiap bulan
     'Uncle sent me some money every month'.
   memberitahu tell
   menginjak tread on
A few verbs which have locative objects and intransitive verb
plus preposition counterparts (see 1-219) do not have suffix
-i. These include mengenal 'know' and mengingat
'remember':
   Saya kenal/ingat akan dia.
   Saya mengenal/mengingat dia.
   I know/remember him.
Repetitive -/
1.226 Suffix -i can be added to a number of simple
transitive verbs to indicate that the action is performed more
than once. The precise meaning of -i depends on the context
and the particular verb base. It may indicate action done
separately to a number of objects or repeated action on the
one object, either by one actor or more. The difference is
shown by the following examples:
   Dia mencium pacarnya.
   He kissed his girl friend.
   Dia menciumi pacarnya.
   He kissed his girl friend repeatedly/a number of times.
   Kami akan menjemput mereka.
   We will collect them.
   Kami akan menjemputi mereka.
   We will collect them (in more than one trip).
   Mereka menebang pohon di depan rumahnya.
   They chopped down the tree in front of their house.
   Mereka menebangi pohon di sekitar rumahnya.
   They chopped down the trees around their house.
With the following examples the gloss does not distinguish
the different possibilities:
   mengambili fetch repeatedly
   memukuli hit repeatedly
   mengangkati lift repeatedly
   menggigiti bite repeatedly
   menggaruki scratch repeatedly
   membungkusi wrap (many things)
   menembaki shoot repeatedly
   menjuali sell off, sell (many things)
   menutupi shut (many things)
1.227 With some verbs -i indicates intensity or
thoroughness. Thus memandang means 'look at , while  1memandangi means 'gaze at':
   Tiap pasang mata memandangi kami.
   Each pair of eyes gazed at us.
Other verbs indicating intensity include:
   membakari burn up completely
   melihati scrutinise, look at intently
  memegangi grip, hold tightly
   memeriksai inspect carefully
With a few verbs, such as memakani 'eat up', the meanings of
repetition and thoroughness are not clearly distinguished:
   Burung itu memakani padi.
   The birds ate up the rice.
With several verbs -i incorporates both a locative object and
repeated or intensive action. Thus melempari means 'throw
(many things) at', a meaning also conveyed by the English
translation 'pelt' (as in the example in section 1.222). The
verb menanyai corresponds to the intransitive verb plus
preposition bertanya kepada 'ask' but for most people it also
suggests intensity or thoroughness, thus meaning 'question,
interrogate', rather than just 'ask':
   Polisi menanyai tersangka.
   The police interrogated the suspect.
1.228 Many verbs cannot take repetitive -i. This includes
all verbs which do not have a simple transitive form but with
which -i or -kan is required to produce a well-formed
transitive verb. With such verbs repetition must be indicated
by an adjunct, such as berkali-kali 'repeatedly' or berulang-
ulang 'over and over'. Such adjuncts can also replace
repetitive -i:
    Dia mencium pacarnya berkali-kali.
    He kissed his girlfriend again and again/repeatedly.
Suffixes -kan and -/ compared
1.229 Many verbs can take both -kan and -i, usually with a
clear distinction in meaning, -kan marking the object as
patient and -i marking it as location or recipient (see 3.17).
The -i verb may be ditransitive (see 1.221) or have only a
single object (see 1.222):
   Mereka menawarkan bantuan kepada saya.
   They offered help to me.
   Mereka menawari saya bantuan.
   They offered me help.
   Buruh itu memuatkan beras ke kapal.
   The workers loaded the rice onto the ship.
   Buruh itu memuati kapal dengan beras.
   The workers loaded the ship with rice.
   Sopir memasukkan mobil ke dalam garasi.
   The driver put the car into the garage.
   Mobil memasuki garasi.
   The car entered the garage.
Not all verbs with verbal bases take both suffixes. Many
verbs, including menyewakan lend , have no corresponding
                                    1-i forms:
    Parno menyewakan rumahnya kepada keluarga Sugito.
    Parno rented his house to the Sugito family.
There is no -kan form corresponding to a number of -i verbs,
such as menghiasi 'decorate :
                           1   Dia menghiasi kamarnya dengan bunga.
   She decorated her room with flowers.
1.230 With a number of words the distinction between
-kan and -i is blurred in common usage.
In some cases both -i and -kan occur with the same meaning.
With some there is a recipient or locative object, while with
others the object is the patient:
   menamai, menamakan name
   mengenai, mengenakan subject to
   mengingini, menginginkan desire
   menyakiti, menyakitkan hurt
   menyembahyangi, menyembahyangkan pray over,
     conduct service for
   mendoai, mendoakan pray for
   menghamili, menghamilkan make pregnant
   Mereka menamai/menamakan anaknya Ali.
   They named their child Ali.
   Goenawan dikenai/dikenakan skorsing dua tahun.
   Goenawan was subjected to a two year disqualification.
With these words both forms are generally acceptable.
Nevertheless, there is a considerable amount of confusion in
the minds of many people as to which suffix is appropriate
with certain verbs. Typical is the use of menugaskan instead
of menugasi 'assign', literally 'give tugas (duty/assignment)
to'. While purists insist on the -i form, use of -kan is
common, even among educated people:         9    Mereka menugasi/(menugaskan) dia mengadakan
    observasi.
    They assigned him to carry out observations.
In the active, but not in passive voice, memberikan
commonly occurs with a recipient object, although in this
case also purists regard the -kan form as ungrammatical:
   Ibu memberi/(memberikan) anaknya baju baru.
   Mother gave her son a new shirt.
In the case of memberikan and mengenakan, referred to
above, purists accept only a patient object:
   Ibu memberikan baju baru kepada anaknya.
   Mother gave a new shirt to her son.
   Skorsing dua tahun dikenakan pada Goenawan.
   A disqualification of two years was applied to Goenawan.
1.231 Some -kan verbs have a recipient or locative object.
Reference is made in section 1.197 to -kan verbs having a
locative meaning with emotive adjective bases, such as
     This has prompted a number of grammarians, such as Badudu (1983*
     45-6), to discuss the 'correct usage of m e n u g a s i and
                                     1     menugaskan, the latter being acceptable only with an object
     identifying the patient.
mencemaskan 'be apprehensive about'. In such cases an
intransitive emotive verb plus preposition (see 1.219)
corresponds to a -kan transitive verb rather than an -i verb:
bangga akan, membanggakan 'be proud of.
1.232 Occurrence of -i where -kan would be expected is
rarer (see also 1.216). The -i form mengantongi (uang)
'pocket (money)' has a patient object (compare
memenjarakan (penjahat) 'jail (a criminal)'). Many people
use menakut-nakuti (anak) (with obligatory reduplication)
'frighten (a child)' instead of menakutkan, although others
also recognise menakuti 'fear' with a locative object.
1.233 With some verbs acceptability of forms differs
between active and passive constructions. This is discussed in
section 3.35.
Transitive verbs with prefix per-
1.234 Prefix per- can occur alone or in combination with
-kan and -i. Examples are given in the active voice, with
prefixation m em per-. Verbs formed with the combination of
per- and -kan are discussed in sections 1.239-44; those
formed with per- and -i are discussed in section 1.245.
1.235 Per- can occur with adjective bases to form causative
verbs. It is sometimes stated that such verbs differ from
causatives with -kan (see 1.192) in that with -kan the object is
caused to take on a characteristic it did not previously have,
while with per- the object already has the characteristic and is
caused to have it in greater degree. Thus from besar 'big' is
derived membesarkan 'make big something which is not big'
and memperbesar 'make bigger something which is already
big'. Other people recognise no contrast between the two
affixes, regarding per- verbs simply as indicating that the
object is caused to have the characteristic of the base, whether
it already had the characteristic to some degree or not. It is
probable there is considerable variation in usage between
different speakers, with many people making no distinction
between the functions of the two affixes. Causative verbs with
per- include:
    memperkecil reduce, make small (kecil small)
   mempercepat speed up (cepat fast)
   memperkuat strengthen (kuat strong)
   mempersempit make narrow (sempit narrow)
   memperpanjang extend, make longer (panjang long)
   mempermudah make easy (mudah easy)
   memperkaya enrich (kaya rich)
   memperlemah weaken (lemah weak)
Affixes per- and -kan cannot always substitute for each other
with adjective bases. Thus memperpanjang 'lengthen/extend
(the time of the object) , as in memperpanjang visa 'extend a
                          1visa' and memperdalam 'deepen', as in memperdalam
pengetahuan 'deepen knowledge', cannot be replaced by
memanjangkan 'lengthen' and mendalamkan 'deepen'
respectively, which apply only to physical objects.
With some bases one affix or the other does not occur or is
very infrequent. Thus memperkaya 'enrich' is common while
it is doubtful if many people use mengayakan. Only
memperindah means 'beautify', mengindahkan, meaning 'pay
attention to', having a different base. While per- is less
                                               10frequent with most bases than -kan it is nevertheless
productive and can occur with new adjectives, such as canggih
'sophisticated', a word which was introduced in the mid 1980s:
    Negara-negara Asia mencoba mempercanggih
    kemampuan militernya.
   The Asian countries are trying to make their military
   capability (more) sophisticated.
To produce causative verbs per- occurs only with adjective
bases, not with intransitive verb bases. Thus there is no per-
form corresponding to - k a n causatives such as
membangunkan 'wake (someone) up' and memandikan 'bath
(someone)'.","[108, 109, 110, 111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 120, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125, 126, 127]"
"Adjective phrases
2.99 Adjectives act as heads of a variety of different
phrase structures. Some of the important components of
adjective phrases are discussed in the following sections. Not
all adjectives can occur with all the phrase elements discussed;
some subclasses of adjective are restricted in the elements with
which they can co-occur.
Modifying adverbs
2.100 The adjective can be preceded by one of a number
of modifying adverbs. These show the amount or intensity of
the quality indicated by the adjective. These include:
   sangat, amat very
   terlalu, terlampau too
   sungguh really, truly
   cukup enough
   relatif relatively
   serba completely
   agak rather
   makin, semakin, kian, tambah, bertambah increasingly
   begitu, demikian, sedemikian so, like that
   begini so, like this
   Beban ini sungguh berat.
   This load is truly heavy.
   Tingkat radiasi relatif tinggi.
   The radiation level is relatively high.
   Iran secara militer sudah makin kuat.
   Militarily Iran has become increasingly strong.
   Mengapa saudara demikian lelah?
   Why are you so tired?
A number of modifying adverbs follow the adjective,
including:
   sekali very
   belaka entirely, completely
   sama sekali entirely
   benar really
   Janjinya palsu belaka.
   His promises are completely false.
   Urusannya sudah beres sama sekali.
   His affairs are entirely in order.
The adverb sedikit 'a little can precede or follow the adjective:
                           1  sedikit pusing/pusing sedikit
  a little dizzy
A few modifying adverbs can co-occur for emphasis. The
commonest combinations are amat sangat 'exceedingly',
sangat... sekali 'exceedingly', agak ... sedikit 'somewhat':
   Daging ini agak mahal sedikit.
   This meat is somewhat expensive.
   Dia amat sangat kaya.
   He is extremely rich.
Some of the modifying adverbs, including cukup 'enough'
and terlalu 'too', can cooccur with a phrase beginning with
untuk, bagi or buat 'for' (see 2.105).
When the adjective phrase occurs as a predicate (see 3.9) with
tidak most speakers replace sekali 'very' by begitu 'so':
   Rumahnya tidak begitu besar.
   His house isn't very big.
Modifying adverbs like makin commonly occur in correlative
structures, such as:
    Ali makin besar makin sombong.
   The older Ali gets the more arrogant he becomes.
These constructions are discussed in section 4.90.
Comparative phrases
2.101 The comparative adjective phrase is formed by
placing lebih 'more' or kurang 'less' before the adjective:
lebih besar 'bigger', lebih jelas 'clearer', lebih indah 'more
beautiful', kurang mahal 'less expensive':
   Saya minta air yang kurang panas.
   Could I have water which isn't so hot.
The major expansion of the comparative phrase is with dari
or daripada 'than' followed by a noun phrase indicating the
person or thing with which comparison is being made :            3   Dia lebih tinggi dari saya»
   He is taller than me.
   Mobil Jepang kurang mahal daripada mobil Amerika.
   Japanese cars are less expensive than American cars.
Lebih can itself be preceded by a number of modifiers,
including jauh 'far , sedikit 'a little', a number followed by kali
                     1'times' (see 2.197), or a noun indicating distance, weight or
measure:
    Rumah ini jauh lebih mahal dari rumah itu.
    This house is far more expensive than that one.
    Situasi hari Minggu sedikit lebih tenang.
    The situation on Sunday was a little calmer.
    Kota ini dua puluh kali lebih besar.
    This town is twenty times bigger.
    Jalan ini tiga meter lebih lebar daripada jalan-jalan
    lain.
    This road is three meters wider than the other roads.
Kurang can be replaced by kalah. Preceded by a negative
only kalah can occur:
   Tuti kurang/kalah cantik.
   Tuti is less pretty.
   ""Siapa bilang?"" bantah saya, tak kalah keras.
   ""Who said so?"" I protested, no less harshly.
When kalah occurs dari(pada) can be replaced by dengan:      Verhaar (1988: 56) says dari is more colloquial than daripada 'but
      not distinctly substandard while Tata Bahasa Baku Bahasa
                                  1      Indonesia (1988: 216) says dari is non-standard. Chaer (1988:
      163) advises against use of dari in comparative constructions.
      However, while this stand is taken by some grammarians it is not
      generally accepted and dari is by far the more frequent of the two in
      both formal and informal Indonesian.
   Tulisan Subagio tidak kalah blak-blakan dengan tulisan
   orang Australia yang mana pun.
   Subagio's writing is no less frank than that of any
   Australian.
Superlative phrases
2.102 These are formed by placing paling 'most' or prefix
ter- before the adjective: paling kaya, terkaya 'richest ,  1paling tinggi, tertinggi 'highest'.
Many people allow prefix ter- only with two syllable
adjectives; it cannot occur with longer adjectives, compounds
or verbs acting adjectivally. Thus it cannot replace paling in
paling berani 'bravest', paling berguna 'most useful', paling
menyenangkan 'most pleasing', paling keras kepala 'most
obstinate'. The exception are a few words which are actually
made adjectival by addition of ter-; thus belakang 'behind'
and ke muka 'to the front' act as adjectives only in
terbelakang 'most backward, last' and terkemuka 'most
prominent, foremost'.
A superlative phrase can be expanded by a number of
delimiting prepositional phrases, most commonly phrases
beginning with dari 'of or di 'in':
   Nasi goreng yang paling enak dari semua makanan
   yang tersedia.
   Fried rice is the tastiest of all the food available.
   Ini gempa bumi terburuk di daerah ini.
   This was the worst earthquake in this district.
A superlative phrase can contain an ordinal number (see
1.151) indicating ranking. Prefix ke- on the ordinal can be
replaced by nomor 'number':
   Dia petinju terbaik kedua/Dia petinju terbaik nomor dua.
   He is the second best boxer.
The ordinal can precede the head of the adjective phrase, in
which case yang optionally comes between the ordinal and
head:
   Ini nomor delapan terendah.
   This is the eighth lowest.
   Dia petinju kedua yang terbaik.
   He is the second best boxer.
The ordinal can cooccur with a delimiter:
  Vietnam akan menjadi negara pengekspor beras ketiga
  terbesar di dunia.
  Vietnam will become the third largest exporter of rice in
  the world.
Equative phrases
2.103 An equative construction says that one thing is
similar to another in the quality indicated by the adjective.
The other thing is expressed as a qualifier following the
adjective. There are two constructions:
   a. se- + adjective + qualifier
   b. sama + adjective-nya dengan + qualifier
The latter construction is actually a type of topic-comment
construction (see 3.87) which needs discussion here because
of its meaning. The qualifier is usually a noun phrase:
   Gedung ini setinggi gedung itu.
   Gedung ini sama tingginya dengan gedung itu.
   This building is as tall as that building.
The qualifier may be ini 'this' or itu 'that' or a nominalised
construction (see 3.132) with yang ini 'this one or yang itu
                                                   1'that one'. The difference in meaning is shown by the
following:
    Buku ini tidak semahal yang itu.
    This book is not as expensive as that one.
   Buku ini tidak semahal itu.
   This book is not that expensive.
In the first sentence above yang itu refers to another book
while in the second itu refers to, for instance, a price
previously mentioned.
With the se- construction the qualifier can be a relative clause:
  Saya tidak sebodoh yang dikira orang.
  I'm not as silly as people think.
The sama ... -nya construction cannot be used if the
preceding noun is first or second person. Thus it cannot
occur in the following:
   Saya setinggi Ali.
   I'm as tall as Ali.
Nor can it occur following tidak. Thus it cannot occur in the
following:
   Buku ini tidak semahal yang itu.
   This book is not as expensive as that one.
The sama ... -nya construction allows the two things being
equated to be indicated in the same noun phrase. The se-
construction cannot occur here:
   John dan Ali sama pandainya.
   John and Ali are as clever as each other/are equally clever.
In such constructions, where there is no qualifier, many
speakers allow omission of -nya:
   Mereka sama pandai.
   They are equally clever.
If the head of the phrase is a compound only sama ... -nya
can occur:
    Tini sama lemah lembutnya dengan kakaknya.
    Tini is as gentle as her older sister.
The modifying adverb hampir 'almost' can precede an
equative construction with se-:
   Dia hampir setinggi saya.
   He's almost as tall as me.
Negated adjectives
2.104 An adjective preceded by paling 'most' and a
number of modifying adverbs (see 2.100) can be negated.
Tidak occurs between paling or the modifier and the
adjective:
   Ini makanan yang paling tidak enak.
   This is the most unpleasant food.
   Cara itu sangat tidak manusiawi.
   That method is very inhumane.
   Organisasi itu dinilainya kian tidak efisien.
   He judges that organisation as increasingly inefficient.
In such constructions only the adjective is negated. This is
different from negation of a whole adjective phrase when it
occurs in the predicate of an adjective clause (see 3.9). In this
case tidak precedes the whole phrase:
   Makanan ini tidak begitu enak.
   This food isn't very tasty.
   Jasnya tidak terlalu besar.
   His jacket isn't too big.
Referent phrases
2.105 A prepositional phrase introduced by untuk, bagi or
buat 'for' can follow the adjective to indicate with reference to
whom or what the characteristic indicated by the adjective
applies:
   Ini aneh untuk saya.
   This is strange for me.
A modifying adverb can precede the adjective:
  Mobil ini terlalu besar buat kami.
  This car is too big for us.
  Udara di Jakarta makin tidak baik untuk paru-paru.
  The air in Jakarta is increasingly bad for the lungs.
Frequently an adjective phrase containing a referent phrase
occurs as the predicate of a clause whose subject begins with
untuk (see 3.115). If the subject follows the predicate, which
it usually does, the referent phrase takes bagi, to avoid the
occurrence of a series of constructions beginning with untuk
(another example occurs in section 3.115):
    Sulit bagi kita untuk menurunkan harga.
    It is difficult for us to lower prices.
If the subject does not begin with untuk, being a simple
nominal clause (see 3.143), the referent phrase can begin with
untuk:
   Sulit untuk kami memperoleh bukti.
   It is difficult for us to get proof.
NUMBERS AND NUMBER PHRASES
2.106 Numbers are either definite or indefinite. The
position of numbers within noun phrases is discussed in
sections 2.14-20. In the following sections the internal
structure of numbers is discussed. The only definite numbers
discussed here are cardinal numbers (see 2.107-12). Derived
numbers are described in sections 1.145-63.
Cardinal numbers
2.107 Cardinal units are:
   satu one
   dua two
   tiga three
   empat four
   lima five
   enam six
   tujuh seven
   delapan eight
   sembilan nine
Group numbers are:
  puluh tens
  belas teens
  ratus hundreds
  ribu thousands
  juta millions
  milyar billions
Group numbers combine with one of the units. 'One' is se-
except that with juta the full unit satu can occur and with
milyar it must occur:
   sepuluh ten
   seribu one thousand
   sejuta, satu juta one million
   satu milyar one billion
Otherwise a full unit precedes the group number:
  dua puluh twenty
   tiga belas thirteen
  empat ratus four hundred
Smaller numbers are expressed after larger numbers:
  dua puluh satu twenty one
  seratus lima puluh one hundred and fifty
  dua ribu enam ratus tiga puluh sembilan
  two thousand six hundred and thirty nine
When numbers are written with Arabic numerals a full stop,
rather than a comma, is used to mark off each three placings:
   1.000 (seribu) 1,000
   2.300.000 (dua juta tiga ratus ribu) 2,300,000
2.108 Fractions (see also 1.149) follow full numbers:
   satu setengah one and a half
   dua sepertiga two and a third
   lima dua pertiga five and two thirds
   Saya sudah membaca dua setengah halaman.
   I've read two and a half pages.
2.109 In decimal numbers koma 'comma , equivalent to
                                             1'point' in English, and represented in writing by a comma,
precedes the numerator:
   dua koma tiga (2,3)
   two point three (2.3)
   satu koma satu juta (1,1 juta)
   one point one million (1.1 million)
2.110 'Nought, zero' is nol, although in reading out lists of
numerals, such as in telephone numbers, many people use
kosong:
   tiga nol dua/tiga kosong dua
   three o two/three zero two (302)
2.111 Arithmetic phrases consist of two cardinal numbers
separated by a word indicating an arithmetic operation:
   enam tambah dua six plus two
   sepuluh kurang lima ten minus five
   tiga kali dua three times two
   enam belas dibagi dua sixteen divided by two
Such phrases frequently occur as subject of a clause with
sama dengan 'equals' (see 3.13).
2.112 Cardinal numbers can be preceded by a modifier,
such as lebih dari more than':
                  f   Lebih dari sepuluh orang tewas dalam kecelakaan itu.
   More than ten people died in the accident.
Modifiers of cardinal numbers include:
  kira-kira, sekitar, kurang lebih about, more or less
  hampir almost
  sampai up to
  genap fully
  lebih dari more than
  kurang dari less than
The last two modifiers in the above list can be negated:
  Tidak kurang dari satu juta orang menjadi pengecer
  Amway.
  No less than one million people have become Amway
  retailers.
The modifier lebih can follow the number:
  Akuarium itu dapat menampung lima ribu lebih
  binatang laut.
  The aquarium can hold more than five thousand sea
  creatures.
Indefinite numbers
2.113 Indefinite numbers include the following:
   semua all
   segala all
   seluruh all of, whole of; all
   segenap all
   seantero the whole (of an area)
   sebagian part of
   tiap, setiap, tiap-tiap each, every
   banyak many (with count nouns); a lot, much (with non-
      count nouns)
   beberapa several
   sedikit a little, few
   bermacam-macam various, all sorts of
   berbagai, pelbagai various
   sejumlah a number of
   kebanyakan most
   salah satu, salah seorang one of
   masing-masing each
   aneka various, all sorts of
   sembarang any (kind of), no particular
Some indefinite numbers, including banyak and sedikit, can
take a modifying adverb (see 2.100):
   banyak sekali orang very many people
   terlalu sedikit gula too little sugar
Banyak is preceded by lebih 'more' before a noun where in
English 'more' directly preceded the noun:
  lebih banyak uang more money
Several indefinite numbers can be negated by tidak, including
semua, seluruh, setiap, banyak, sedikit:
   Tidak banyak orang yang senang pada dia.
   Not many people like him.
   Tidak semua orang bisa mengontrol marah seperti itu.
   Not all people can control anger in that way.
Sembarang differs from other indefinite numbers in that it is
negated by bukan:
   Bukan sembarang orang diundang.
   Not just any old person was invited.
Several indefinite numbers can be pronominalised (see 2.95).
2.114 The indefinite number suatu 'a, one is similar in
                                               1function to sebuah (see 2.21). This usually occurs with
abstract nouns:
   suatu sistem/ide yang bagus/penyelidikan/pertemuan
   a system/good idea/investigation/meeting
While suatu is sometimes used with concrete objects, (se)buah
is sometimes used with abstract things; there is thus some
overlap:
   sebuah/suatu pondok/dialek/propinsi/kesimpulan
   a hut/dialect/province/conclusion
However, unlike classifiers, suatu is inherently singular.
2.115 The indefinite number masing-masing deserves
some comment. It occurs before a noun - but after a
pronoun (see 2.80) - with a similar meaning to tiap 'each , but
                                                             1emphasises the separateness of each of the people or things
involved:
   Masing-masing transmigran menerima sebidang tanah.
   Each transmigrant received a plot of land.
It also occurs after a noun, where the separateness of each of
the people or things referred to is caused by its correlation
separately with someone or something mentioned elsewhere.
In this case it could also be regarded as following a possessive
pronoun with the pronoun deleted:
    Mereka pulang ke rumah masing-masing.
    They each returned to their own home.
    Para sandera menelpon keluarga masing-masing.
    Each of the hostages telephoned his (own) family.
Masing-masing can occur as an indefinite pronoun (see
2.96).
2.116 A special indefinite number is para. Used only with
humans, para marks the noun as plural and referring to a
particular group:
   Jenaza para korban dibawa ke rumah sakit.
   The bodies of the victims were taken to the hospital.
   Beginilah terungkapkan cinta dan kesetiaan terhadap
   para leluhur.
   In this way can be expressed love and faithfulness to the
   ancestors.
Para is used only with nouns indicating people having some
characteristic in common, such as para guru 'the teachers',
para nelayan 'the fishermen'. It does not occur with generic
nouns such as orang 'person', anak 'child', manusia 'human'.
2.117 While satu-satunya 'the only' is not specifically
indefinite it can be grouped with indefinite numbers:
   Satu-satunya jembatan dari desa itu sudah rusak.
   The only bridge from that village has been wrecked.","[205, 206, 207, 208, 209, 210, 211, 212, 213, 214, 215, 216, 217]"
"Voice: active and passive
3.26 The person or thing we want to talk about is usually
expressed as the subject of the clause. If we want to talk
about the actor we make it the subject of the verb and use an
active verb. Active transitive verbs have prefix meN-. The
construction is called an active clause or said to be in active
voice.
The other participant in the action is expressed by the object
in an active clause. If we want to focus attention on this
person or thing we make it the subject of the passive form of
the verb. The construction is called a passive clause or is said
to be in passive voice. The actor is expressed by an agent
phrase which follows the passive verb. A passive verb usually
lias prefix di-. The first example below is an active
construction in which the subject is the actor; the second is a
passive construction in which the subject is the patient:
    Mereka sudah menjemput Tomo.
    They have met Tomo.
    Tomo sudah dijemput oleh mereka.
    Tomo has been met by them.
Some grammars of Indonesian do not use the terms active
and passive, instead using such terms as subject and object
construction or subjective and objective focus. This is
because there are differences between the constructions in
Indonesian and the active and passive in European languages
such as English, in both structure and function. Nevertheless,
there are also important similarities, and the relationship
between the two constructions is often similar to the
relationship between active and passive in English, allowing
the same terms to be used to describe them. The structure of
a passive clause can be described in terms of a transformation
from the corresponding active.
The passive construction is more frequent in Indonesian than
in English. Where a passive translation would sound
unnatural, translation by an active construction is usually
given in the following sections.
The Indonesian passive has two different forms, called here
'passive type one' and 'passive type two' . The choice of
                                                1passive type is determined by the actor.
Passive Type One
3.27 In this type of passive the actor is third person, that is
pronoun dia or mereka, or a noun. Passive type one is also
used if no actor is expressed. The structure of an active
clause and its corresponding passive type one are set out as
follows:
    Active voice:
      Subject (actor) + meN-verb + Object (patient)
   Passive voice:
      Subject (patient) + di-verb + (oleh) + Agent
      (actor)
These structures are illustrated by the following active clause
and its passive transformation:
   Dia menjemput saya.
   He met me.
      The terms 'passive type one' and 'passive type two are used by
                                                       1      Dardjowidjojo (1978).
   Saya dijemput oieh dia.
   I was met by him.
In the above example the actor is dia 'he'. The following
illustrate passives with the other possible actors, mereka, a
noun or no actor expressed:
    Dia sudah diberi uang itu oleh mereka.
    He has already been given the money by them.
    Surat ini ditulis oleh Tomo.
    This letter was written by Tomo.
    Barang ini akan dikirim ke Jepang.
    These goods will be sent to Japan.
A third person singular agent can be expressed by either dia
or -nya. They are optionally preceded by oleh 'by':
   Saya dijemputnya/olehnya.
   Saya dijemput dia/oleh dia.
   I was met by him.
Oleh is always optional except when the agent does not
immediately follow the verb, in which case it is obligatory.
This occurs when another clause element comes between the
verb and agent or when the agent is placed before the verb to
receive highlighting (see 3.47).
In passive type one the components of the predicate (see
2.132ff) apart from the verb remain unchanged:
   Mereka sudah dijemputnya.
   They have already been met by him.
   Mereka tidak harus dijemputnya.
   They do not have to be met by him.
While makan 'eat', minum 'drink' and a few other transitive
verbs usually occur without prefix meN- in active voice (see
 1.186), they take di- in the passive: dimakan 'eaten', diminum
'drunk'. The verb mengerti 'understand' retains its prefix
meN- in the passive (see 1.186): dimengerti 'understood'.
Passive Type Two
3.28 In passive type two the agent is a pronoun or
pronoun substitute (see 2.67). The agent phrase comes
before the verb, which does not have a prefix. The structure
of passive type two is thus:
   Subject (patient) + Agent (actor) + Verb
The following example shows the relationship between an
active clause and a passive type two clause:
   Kami menjemput dia.
   We met him.
   Dia kami jemput
   He was met by us.
No other component of the clause can come between the
agent and the verb in passive type two. In particular,
components of the predicate phrase (see 2.132ff), such as
negative and temporal marker, come before the agent in
passive type two:
   Buku ini tidak akan kami baca.
   This book will not be read by us.
If the agent is aku T or kamu 'you', the bound forms, ku- and
kau- respectively (see 2.71), usually occur:
    Buku ini sudah kubaca.
    I've read this book.
    Buku ini harus kaubaca.
    You must read this book.
Choosing Passive Type
3.29 When an active clause is transformed into a passive
two things must be considered in deciding if the passive is to
be passive type one or two: Is the actor first, second or third
person? and: Is the actor a pronoun (including a pronoun
substitute) or is it a noun?  2Nouns and pronouns can be distinguished as follows:      Although sentences with oleh saya and so on (passive type
      one with first or second person agent) are regarded as ungrammatical
      they do occur in spontaneous speech, even among educated
      speakers, especially if the agent is added as an afterthought.
             first          second      third
             person         person      person   singular saya            kamu etc. dia             A
   plural kami, kita           B      mereka        nounsPassive type one is used where the actor is in box A and
passive type two is used where the actor is in box B.
3.30 Either passive type one or passive type two can be
used if the actor is dia or mereka; they occur in both boxes
in the diagram in section 3.29. This is because they are third
person, allowing passive type one, and also pronouns,
allowing passive type two:
    Buku sejarah ini belum dibacanya.
    Buku sejarah ini belum dia baca.
    He hasn't read this history book yet.
    Buku-buku ini sudah dibaca oleh mereka.
    Buku-buku ini sudah mereka baca.
    They have read these books.
3.31 As mentioned in section 2.67, kinship terms such as
bapak 'father', ibu 'mother' and personal names can occur as
pronoun substitutes. They can refer to the addressee,
meaning 'you', or to the speaker, meaning T. When they
occur as agent passive type two is used:
   Buku itu sudah Tini kembalikan.
   I (Tini) have returned the book.
   Surat ini harus bapak tandatangani.
   You must sign this letter.
If a third person is being spoken about then Tini and bapak
would be third person nouns and passive type one would be
used:
    Buku itu sudah dikembalikan oleh Tini.
   The book has been returned by Tini.
    Surat ini harus ditandatangani bapak.
   This letter has to be signed by father.
3 32 With ter- verbs (see 1.265ff) and ke-...-an verbs (see
 #1.276ff) which allow an agent, only passive type one occurs,
even if the agent is first or second person. If the agent is a
pronoun, including a third person pronoun, oleh is
obligatory. Examples are given in sections 1.269, 1.272 and
L283. One exception is with teringat 'remember' (see
1.271).
Further changes from active to passive
3.33 Typically, transformation from an active
construction to a passive involves no more than the changes
described in sections 3.26-31. Components of the clause
other than subject, verb and object are not affected.
3.34 If there are two objects (see 3.20) it is only the
primary object - the one immediately following the verb -
which becomes the subject of the passive. The following
examples illustrate active clauses with benefactive -kan and
locative -i and their passive transformations:
   Dia membelikan adiknya buku.
   He bought his brother a book.
   Adiknya dibelikannya buku.
   His brother was bought a book by him.
   Kepala kantor menyerahi kami tugas itu.
   The office head handed us that task.
   Kami diserahi kepala kantor tugas itu.
   We were handed that task by the office head.
The final noun phrase in each of the above examples - the
secondary object - may be subject of a passive clause, but
only one which is a transformation of an active clause in
which that noun phrase is primary object. The following
sentences correspond to those above except that the
secondary object has become the primary object:
   Dia membeli buku itu untuk adiknya.
   He bought that book for his brother.
   Buku itu dibelinya untuk adiknya.
   That book was bought by him for his brother.
   Kepala kantor menyerahkan tugas itu kepada kami.
   The office head handed that task to us.
   Tugas itu deserahkan oleh kepala kantor kepada kami.
   That task was handed by the office head to us.
3.35 In general a transformation from active to passive
has no effect on suffixes -i and -kan, which are retained when
an active verb is transformed to a passive. However, there are
some cases in which their presence or absence differs between
active and passive.
With some verbs -kan is optional in active voice but
obligatory in passive voice, including verbs with bases ajar
'teach , kirim 'send', beri 'give', nyanyi 'sing':
     1    Dia mengajar(kan) bahasa Indonesia.
    He teaches Indonesian.
    Bahasa Indonesia diajarkan di sini.
    Indonesian is taught here.
    Dia sudah memberi(kan) uang itu kepada adiknya.
    He has given the money to his brother.
    Uang itu sudah diberikan kepada adiknya.
    The money has been given to his brother.
    Mereka menyanyi(kan) lagu Indonesia.
    They are singing an Indonesian song.
    Lagu apa yang mereka nyanyikan?
    What song are they singing?
On the other hand -kan is obligatory with some active verbs,
such as meninggalkan 'leave' and memaksudkan 'mean', but
can be omitted in the passive:
    Dia meninggalkan tasnya di kantin.
    She left her bag (deliberately) in the canteen.
    Tasnya ditinggal(kan) di kantin.
    Her bag was left (deliberately) in the canteen.
  ' Dia memaksudkan kalimat ini.
    He means this sentence.
    Kalimat ini yang dimaksud.
    This is the sentence which is meant.
3.36 A number of -kan verbs with emotive adjective bases
are usually causative in active voice but indicate that the actor
undergoes the emotion in the passive. These are discussed in
section 1.197.
3.37 Preposition dengan 'with can be omitted in a passive
                                  1clause if the subject marks the recipient. In almost all cases
the verb has locative -i and no agent is expressed:
   Aku didandani pakaian pengantin.
   I was adorned in bridal clothes.
   Kamar-kamar di hotel ini dilengkapi sistem pendingin.
   Rooms in this hotel are provided with a cooling system.
   Tanah itu ditanami pohon jati.
   The land was planted with teak trees.
The verb can be a simple transitive verb but the relationship
of the subject must nevertheless be that of recipient:
   Tangannya diikat tali plastik.
   His hands were bound with plastic cord.
If an agent is expressed it must follow the instrument,
otherwise dengan must occur:
   Kantor Monitor dilempari batu oleh sekelompok
   mahasiswa Islam.
   The Monitor office was pelted with stones by a group of
   Moslem students.
   Ladang itu ditanami oleh Pak Mendur dengan ubi.
   The gardens were planted by Mr Mendur with cassava.
Dengan cannot be omitted if the subject marks the patient:
  Nasi boleh dimakan dengan tangan.
  Rice can be eaten by hand.
Uses of the passive
3.38 As in English, passive constructions allow the
speaker to avoid mentioning the actor. This is sometimes
necessary or desired because the actor is not known, is
obvious, is not important, or because the action is something
which can be done by anyone:
   Sepedanya dicuri tadi malam.
   His car was stolen last night.
   Saya disuruh pergi.
   I was ordered to go.
   Mayatnya ditemukan dekat rel kereta api.
   His body was discovered near the railway line.
   Mudah-mudahan segala dosa orang ini akan diampuni.
   Hopefully all this person's sins will be forgiven.
   B u k u macam ini dapat dipinjam dari perpustakaan
   pusat.
   Books like this can be borrowed from the central library.
3.39 While every active transitive verb has a passive
counterpart, it is not the case that every active construction
can be transformed into a natural or acceptable passive
construction. If the object is indefinite it usually cannot be
the subject of a passive verb. Thus most Indonesians would
not accept a passive transformation of the following active
clauses:
   Dia membaca sebuah buku.
   He's reading a book.
   Dia melihat seseorang.
   He saw someone.
The choice between active and passive voice is a choice
between actor and patient as subject. Subject selection is
primarily a stylistic matter, which means that in a given
context one choice may be more appropriate than another,
but in other contexts more than one choice might be possible.
Thus, the choice between active and passive constructions
cannot usually be explained by inflexible rules. Sometimes,
as when no actor is expressed, a passive construction must be
used, even though the patient is indefinite:
  Seorang gadis kecil, berumur empat tahun, ditemukan
  tadi pagi di depan rumah sakit...
   A little girl, aged four, was discovered this morning in
   front of the hospital... 3   Sebuah rencana untuk mengembangkan dan
   memanfaatkan gas alam sedang disiapkan.
   A plan to develop and use natural gas is being prepared.
In most language styles passive constructions are far more
common in Indonesian than in English. Consequently an
      This example and preceding comments are based on Poedjosoedarmo
      (1986: 3).
Indonesian passive can often only be translated into natural
English by an active construction, as in several of the
examples in previous sections, this being one of the reasons
why some grammarians have been reluctant to apply the
terms active and passive to Indonesian. The following passive
sentences are natural in Indonesian but cannot be translated
by English passives:
   Anaknya sendiri tidak pernah dicarikannya jodoh.
   She had never looked for a marriage partner for her own
   child.
   Surat kabar ini sudah licin tandas saya baca sampai
   iklan-iklannya.
   I've completely read this newspaper right down to the
   advertisements.
   Cuma ini yang saya peroleh hari ini.
   This is all I've got today.
Frequently in narrative discourse a series of actions carried
out by the same actor is expressed by a string of passive
clauses, sometimes following an introductory active clause. In
such sequences there is a focus of interest on the series of
actions rather than on the participants in the action. Some of
the clauses in the following examples include word order
changes discussed in 3.41 ff:
   Dia datang membawa susu dua gelas. Segelas
   diletakkannya di atas meja. Yang lain dibawanya
   padaku.
   She came carrying two glasses of milk. She put one glass
   on the table. The other she brought to me.
   Dimatikannya lampu-lampu dalam kamar tidur itu, lalu
   dengan meraba-raba didekatinya tempat tidur ...
   He turned off the lights in the bedroom then, groping his
   way, he approached the bed ...
   Ia menimang-nimang kaki ayamnya, sebentar hendak
   ditaruhnya juga di piringnya, sebentar hendak
   dibuangnya. Akhirnya, setelah diawasinya benar-benar
   tak ada bagian yang boleh dimakan, barulah
   diletakkannya di lantai ...   4   He played with his chicken leg, one moment going to put
   it on the plate, the next going to throw it away. Finally, but
      This example is quoted by Slametmuiyana (1969: 345)
   only after carefully observing that there was nothing which
   could be eaten, he placed it on the floor...
Reflexive passives
3.40 A reflexive phrase (see 2.162) can be the subject of
a passive clause. In this case diri cannot occur alone;
constructions like melarikan diri 'flee' (see 2.163) cannot be
transformed into the passive. The subject usually follows the
verb:
   Dibandingkannya dirinya dengan raja.
   He compared himself with the king.","[274, 275, 276, 277, 278, 279, 280, 281, 282, 283, 284]"
"      These examples are based on Johns (1981: 86).
Verbs with ber-...-an
1.254 There are two groups of verbs with this affixation,
one group indicating reciprocal action and one group
indicating random action.
Reciprocal ber-...-an verbs
1.255 These verbs indicate that two people do the same
thing to each other, such as bersalaman 'greet each other by
shaking hands', or that two people or things stand in the same
relationship to each other, such as berdekatan 'be near each
other':
   Mereka bersalaman waktu bertemu.
   They shook hands when they met.
   Rumah kami berdekatan.
   Our houses are near each other.
With many verbs the two participants can be expressed in the
same phrase, as above, or one can be expressed in a phrase
beginning with dengan:
   Kapal tangki dan kapal barang bertabrakan.
   The tanker and the cargo ship collided (with each other).
   Kapal tangki bertabrakan dengan kapal barang.
   The tanker collided with the cargo ship.
1.256 Verbs with affixation ber-...-an which indicate
reciprocal action are based on basic transitive verbs. The
group includes:
   berdesakan push and jostle
   berpandangan gaze at each other
   bertabrakan collide with each other
   berbalasan reply to each other
   bersahutan answer back and forth
Most of these verbs can occur with reduplicated base, such as
berkejar-kejaran 'chase each other' (mengejar 'chase'):
   Anak-anak berkejar-kejaran di halaman.
   The children are chasing each other in the yard.
A few are always reduplicated in the usage of some people.
Other verbs which frequently occur with reduplicated base
are:
   berpukul-pukulan hit each other
   bercinta-cintaan love each other
   berpeluk-pelukan embrace each other
   berdesak-desakan pushing and shoving
1.257 Several of these verbs can alternatively be expressed
as base combined with meN- form (see 1.248):
   berpukul-pukulan, pukul-memukul hit each other
   berpeluk-pelukan, peluk-memeluk embrace each other
   bersaingan, saing-menyaingi compete with each other
   bertolong-tolongan, tolong-menolong help each other
However, neither group is very productive and generally there
is only one possible secondary formation relating to a
particular basic verb. Many verbs have no reciprocal form,
reciprocity being expressed by saling, as mentioned in 1.251
and 2.160.
1.258 With a few verbs the two participants stand as actor
and recipient. With these verbs a complement (see 3.65)
occurs, corresponding to an object with the related basic
verbs:
   Mereka berkirim-kiriman surat.
   They send letters to each other.
   Mereka berpegangan tangan.
   They were holding hands.
   Mereka bertukaran cincin.
   They exchanged rings.
1.259 Of verbs which indicate that two people or things
stand in the same relationship, a spatial relationship is usually
referred to:
   berhadapan face each other
   berjauhan be far from each other
   berseberangan be across from each other
   berdampingan be side by side
   berbelakangan be back to back
   berbatasan border on each other
1.260 A few verbs refer to personal relationship:
   bermusuhan be enemies with each other
   berpacaran be boyfriend and girlfriend to each other
These are similar to reciprocal ber- verbs (see section 1.173).
However, with these verbs the base cannot be regarded as a
noun derived with -an as no such form exists. In one case
both ber- and ber-...-an forms occur: b e r m u s u h ,
bermusuhan 'be enemies (with each other)'.
Random action ber-...-an verbs
1.261 These forms are related to basic intransitive verbs.
The subject refers to multiple participants, who carry out the
action in a random, uncoordinated manner. Thus
berdesingan means 'whizzing in all directions' (mendesing
'make whizzing sound'), beterjunan means 'jump down (of
many people acting in an uncoordinated manner)' (terjun
'jump down'):
   Peluru berdesingan.
   Bullets were whizzing about in all directions.
   Ketika kapal itu terbakar penumpang beterjunan ke
   laut.
   When the ship caught fire the passengers jumped into the
   sea.
Since plurality of the subject is implicit it is rarely indicated
overtly; however, it can be expressed:
   Para saksi mata mulai bermatian.
   The eye witnesses were beginning to die off.
Other verbs in this group include:
   berguguran fall (of leaves etc.)
   berdatangan come, arrive (from all directions)
   beterbangan fly (in all directions)
  bergantungan hang (all over the place)
  berlarian running (in all directions)
  bermunculan turn up (from all directions)
A few verbs do not imply a plural actor. The verb berjualan
'sell for a living' (menjual 'sell') can have a single actor and
can also occur with a complement, having the same meaning
as berjual (see 3.64):
    Dia berjualan kuda.
   He sells horses for a living.
The verb bepergian simply means 'go on a trip, travel' (pergi
'go'):
   Bepergianlah dengan kereta api!
   Travel by train!
The verb berkeliaran 'wander about' refers to random,
undirected action but can have a single actor. The verb
berserakan 'scattered about' refers to things in a random
state. These two verbs have no corresponding basic verbal
forms:
   Dia selalu berkeliaran di sini.
   He is always wandering about here.
   Tiang-tiang bambu berserakan.
   Bamboo posts were scattered about.
Verbs with affixation ber-...-kan
1.262 Most of these verbs have noun bases. The
construction contains a noun complement (see 3.65) and has
the general meaning 'subject has complement as [base]'.
Thus, berdasarkan 'be based on' literally means 'have
complement as a dasar (basis, base)'; the first sentence below
literally means 'The philosophy of Indonesia has Pancasila as
a base'. The word bersenjatakan 'be armed with' literally
means 'have complement as a senjata (weapon)'; the second
sentence below literally means 'That country has nuclear
bombs as weapons':
    Filsafat Indonesia berdasarkan Pancasila.
    The philosophy of Indonesia is based on Pancasila.
    Negara itu bersenjatakan bom nuklir.
    That country is armed with nuclear weapons/has nuclear
    weapons.
As in the above examples, these verbs refer not to actions but
to states; there are no corresponding passive forms. Other
verbs in this group include:
   beranggotakan have as members
   bercita-citakan have as an ideal, aspire to
   bersendikan have as a pivotal point
   berisikan have as contents, contain
   beristrikan have as a wife
   bertepikan have as an edge, be edged with
1.263 With some verbs the suffix -kan can be omitted. In
the following examples optional -kan is indicated in
parentheses:
   Botol ini berisi(kan) obat.
   This bottle contains medicine.
   FIS beranggota(kan) lima belas ribu orang.
   FIS has fifteen thousand (people as) members.
   Rumah Sucipto beratap(kan) genting dan
   berdinding(kan) bambu.
   Sucipto's house has a tile roof and bamboo walls.
Some other verbs always retain -kan if there is a complement.
However, corresponding to all ber-...-kan verbs with noun
bases are ber- verbs with no complement, meaning 'have
[base]' (see 1.170). The ber- verbs in the following examples
can be compared with the corresponding ber-...-kan verbs
given in section 1.262:
   Pendapatnya tidak berdasar.
   His opinion has no basis.
   Awas, dia bersenjata.
   Careful, he's armed.
1.264 A number of ber-...-kan verbs have verb bases.
These also form the bases for -an nouns and the ber-...-kan
verb means the same as it would if it had the corresponding
-an noun as a base. Thus bertuliskan means 'have
(complement) as writing (tulisan), have (complement) written
on it, be inscribed with (complement)'; bertutupkan means
'have (complement) as a cover (tutupan), be covered with
(complement):
   Foto-foto presiden dan para menteri bertuliskan ""for
   sale"".
   The photos of the president and ministers had ""for sale""
   written on them.
   Puncak gunung itu bertutupkan salju.
   The peak of the mountain is covered in snow.
Other verbs like this, together with corresponding -an nouns,
include:
   berhiaskan have as a decoration (hiasan), be decorated
      with
   berlukiskan have as a painting (lukisan), be painted with
   berukirkan have as carvings (ukiran)
   berikutkan have as a following attachment (ikutan), be
      followed by
   bercoretkan have as graffiti (coretan), be scrawled with
Such formations are fairly productive in the modern language
and an increasing number are occurring, especially in
journalistic style, which are not included in dictionaries.
The verb bermandikan (peluh/cahaya) 'be bathed in
(sweat/light)' has no corresponding -an noun.
Verbs with prefix ter-
1.265 Most ter- verbs fit one of three categories: stative,
accidental, abilitative.
Stative ter- verbs
1.266 These verbs refer to a state of affairs. As there is no
action involved there cannot be an actor. They thus contrast
with di- passive verbs which refer to an action. The verbs
diletakkan 'placed (by someone)' and ditulis 'written (by
someone)' refer to actions and can hence take an agent, while
terletak 'situated' and tertulis 'written' refer to the state which
exists following an action:
   Koran siapa yang diletakkan di atas meja?
   Whose newspaper has been placed on the table?
   Koran siapa yang terletak di atas meja?
   Whose newspaper is (located) on the table?
   Surat itu ditulis(nya) dalam bahasa Inggris.
   That letter was written (by him) in English.
   Surat itu tertulis dalam bahasa Inggris.
   That letter is written in English.
No other affix can cooccur with stative ter-; any affix present
with the corresponding basic verb is deleted, as with -kan in
the first example above. Other examples of stative ter- are:
   Patung dewa itu terbuat dari emas.
   The statue of the god was made from gold.
   Pengetahuannya sangat terbatas.
   His knowledge is very limited.
   Koran ini tertanggal 20 April.
   This newspaper is dated 20 April.
All stative ter- verbs correspond to basic passive verbs which
describe the action from which the state results. Other verbs
in this group include:
   terkenal well-known
   terputus severed, broken off
   tertutup shut
   tertarik attracted, interested
   terbuka open
   tersedia available
   tercatat noted
   tersebut mentioned
   terlibat involved
   terjamin guaranteed
   tercemar polluted
   terhormat honoured, respected
Accidental ter-
1.267 The word 'accidental is a cover term for a variety of
                             1uncontrolled actions and it is not appropriate in all cases;
depending on the particular verb and the context other terms
may be more appropriate, such as 'unintended, unexpected,
agentless, involuntary, sudden'.
Verbs in English do not distinguish between accidental and
deliberate action. Thus, 'He left his bag in the library' may
refer to a deliberate act or to an unintended act, usually
context making clear which is meant. In Indonesian the
contrast is usually made explicit. In the following sentences
ditinggalkan 'left' and dijatuhkan 'dropped' refer to
deliberate actions while tertinggal and terjatuh refer to
accidental actions:
   Tasnya ditinggalkan di perpustakaan.
   His bag was left (deliberately) in the library.
   Tasnya tertinggal di perpustakaan.
   His bag was left (accidentally) in the library.
   Piring dijatuhkan.
   The plate was dropped (deliberately).
   Piring terjatuh.
   The plate was dropped (accidentally)/The plate fell.
Accidental ter- verbs can be either intransitive or transitive.
Intransitive accidental ter- verbs
1.268 These verbs behave like basic intransitive verbs
except that they explicitly state that the subject undergoes
something unintended, the action often occurring suddenly
and unexpectedly.
   Latif tertidur di kelas.
   Latif fell asleep in class.
   Saja tergelincir di jalan.
   I slipped on the road.
   Tadi pagi saya terbangun jam lima.
   This morning I woke (suddenly and unintentionally) at
   five o'clock.
Other verbs in this subgroup include:
   terdiam fall silent
   tertegun stop suddenly
  terlompat jump suddenly
   terjadi happen
   terkejut be startled
  terbakar catch fire
   terpekik scream suddenly
  tersandung stumble
Transitive accidental ter- verbs
1.269 Transitive accidental verbs are passive. Passive type
one (see 3.27) always occurs, even if the agent is first or
second person:
   Maaf, buku saudara terbawa oleh saya.
   Sorry, I took your book by mistake.
   Maaf, penamu terpakai oleh saya.
   Sorry, I used your pen by mistake.
When the agent is a pronoun, as in the above examples, oleh
'by must occur. It can be omitted if the agent is a noun:
   1   Obat itu terminum anak saya.
   The medicine was accidentally drunk by my child.
An agent is not necessarily expressed and sometimes the
situation is agentless, or is perceived as such, or the agent is of
no importance to the event being related:
    Waktu tabrakan terjadi sopir terlempar dari taksi.
    When the accident occurred the driver was thrown from the
    taxi.
    Dia tersabet dengan senjata tajam.
    He was slashed with a sharp weapon.
    Tertipulah kamu!
    You were tricked!
Sometimes ter- and di- forms can be used together to contrast
deliberate and accidental action:
   Dia ditembak atau tertembak polisi.
   He was shot deliberately or accidentally by the police.
Other transitive accidental ter- verbs include:
   tertabrak collided with
   tepergok caught red handed
   tertangkap caught, arrested
   termakan eaten
   terluka injured
   terbunuh killed
1.270 Accidental ter- verbs are not often associated with
basic verbs with suffix -i or -kan. When they are the suffix
usually drops:
   Agassi dan Graf tersingkir.
   Agassi and Graf were eliminated.
   Penduduk setempat tidak akan terpengaruh oleh
   rencana pemerintah.
   The local population won't be affected by the government
   plan.
   Kita memang mudah terpesona oleh barang-barang
   mahal.
   We are indeed easily enticed by expensive goods.
The ter- verbs in the above three sentences correspond to the
basic verbs disingkirkan 'eliminated , dipengaruhi
                                             1'influenced', and dipesonakan 'enchanted' respectively.
Sometimes a suffix occurring on the basic verb is retained on
the ter- verb, especially in journalistic usage. Dictionaries and
grammars differ markedly in what they list and there is
considerable doubt and disagreement among speakers as to
whether suffixes can occur with some verbs. Sometimes a
suffix is used by some people but not others. The verb in the
following example corresponds to the basic verb digenangi:
   Tujuh ratus rumah tergenangi/tergenang air.
   Seven hundred houses were covered in water.
However, for some speakers a suffix is always unacceptable
with accidental ter- verbs. Dropping of suffixes with
accidental ter- verbs is further discussed in section 1.274.
1.271 The verb teringat 'remember, recall (suddenly)' is
exceptional in a number of ways. It allows a pronoun agent
without oleh:
   Teringatku suatu peristiwa.
   I remembered an incident.
It allows either an active clause structure, resembling
intransitive ingat akan/pada 'remember', or a passive clause
structure, resembling diingat 'remembered':
    Keluarga itu teringat oleh saya.
   Saya teringat akan keluarga itu.
   I suddenly thought of that family.
Abilitative ter- verbs
1.272 These verbs indicate that the agent has the ability to
perform the action. All abilitative constructions are transitive
and passive. As with accidentals, only passive type one
structures (see 3.27) occur, even with first and second person
agents.
Abilitative verbs are usually negated, indicating the inability
of the agent to perform the action:
   Mobil semahal itu tidak terbeli oleh saya.
   I can't afford to buy a car as expensive as that.
   Masalah itu belum terselesaikan oleh kami*
   We haven't yet been able to settle that matter.
Frequently an agent is not expressed:
   Suara dosen tidak terdengar dari sini.
   The lecturer can't be heard from here.
   Soal kemacetan lalu lintas belum terpecahkan.
   The problem of traffic congestion cannot yet be solved.
   Blok-blok perdagangan regional tak terhindari lagi.
   Regional trading blocks can no longer be avoided.
As shown in the above examples, if a basic verb has suffix
-kan or -i, this is regularly retained on the corresponding
abilitative ter- verb (while it is almost always dropped with
accidental verbs - see 1.270).
Although abilitative ter- verbs are usually negated this is not
always the case:
   Kini arteri yang buntu terpintasi.
   Nowadays blocked arteries can be bypassed.
   Lebih dari seratus orang terselamatkan dari feri Estonia.
   More than a hundred people have been saved from the
   ferry Estonia. (literally: ...were able to be saved...)
   Apa pekerjaan itu terselesaikan?
   Can that work be finished?
There is nowadays a tendency for redundant dapat 'can' to
occur if the verb is not negated:
   Diharapkan pencemaran limbah pabrik dapat teratasi.
   It is hoped pollution by factory waste can be overcome.
   Ini semua dapat tercapai berkat kemajuan teknik.
   All of this can be achieved thanks to technological
   progress.
Instead of a ter- verb, a basic di- verb with bisa or dapat 'can'
very frequently occurs to indicate ability:
   Masalah ini belum dapat dipecahkan.
   This problem cannot yet be solved.
Other abilitative ter- verbs (given in the positive) include:
   teramalkan can be predicted
   terelakkan can be avoided
   terkendalikan can be controlled
   terlihat visible, can be seen
   terpisahkan can be separated
   tersingkapkan can be revealed
   tertahankan can be endured
A number of negated ter- verbs have English equivalents with
un-/in~...-able:
   tidak terkatakan indescribable
   tidak terdengar inaudible
   tidak terhindarkan unavoidable
   tidak terlihat invisible
   tidak terlukiskan indescribable
Potentially ambiguous ter- verbs
1.273 Some ter- verbs are potentially ambiguous as to
accidental and abilitative action, although context usually
makes clear which meaning is intended. In their first
occurrence below each of the verbs terbawa and tercuci
indicates ability, this being made clear by the phrases kau ...
sendiri and sebanyak itu. In the second example of each
accidental action is made clear by the use of maaf with
terbawa and the overall situation with tercuci, that is, the
implausibility of washing a letter other than accidentally:
   Apa terbawa oleh kau paket-paket itu sendiri?
   Were you able to carry those parcels by yourself?
   Maaf, koran saudara terbawa oleh saya.
   Sorry, I took your newspaper my mistake.
   Apa tercuci olehmu pakaian sebanyak itu?
   Did you manage to wash that many clothes?
   Suratmu tercuci oleh ibu bersama dengan pakaianmu.
   Mother unintentionally washed your letter along with your
   clothes. 13
It is possible for a word to be ambiguous as to all three basic
functions of ter-, although context makes the intention clear.
      These examples are based on Johns (1978: 251, 253).
Thus the word terbuka is usually understood as stative, as in
the first example below, although, depending on the meaning
of the sentence, it can be accidental, as in the second example,
or abilitative, as in the third example:
   Pintu terbuka.
   The door is open.
   Matanya terbuka lebar karena keheranan.
   His eyes opened wide with amazement.
   Akhirnya pintu itu terbuka juga olehnya.
   Finally he did manage to open the door.
Retention and loss of suffixes with ter- verbs
1.274 If a basic transitive verb has a suffix this is retained
with an abilitative ter- verb (see 1.272) but usually dropped
with an accidental verb, as discussed in 1.270. Thus,
corresponding to dipikirkan 'thought about' is terpikir
'unintentionally thought' and (tidak) terpikirkan 'can (not) be
thought':
   Hal itu belum pernah terpikir olehnya.
   That had never entered his mind.
   Harapan seperti itu tak terpikirkan oleh ayahnya.
   Such a prospect was unthinkable for her father, (literally:
       ...could not be thought by her father.)
Other forms with ter-
1.275 There are many ter- verbs which do not fit easily
into any of the three categories described in sections 1.266 to
1.272. Some verbs like tertawa 'laugh' and tersenyum 'smile'
can be grouped with intransitive accidentals (see 1.268),
indicating action which is considered beyond the control of
the subject. Some words with ter- are not verbs; they belong
to other word classes and in many cases it is doubtful if the
component ter can always be regarded as a prefix in the
modern language. Such words include terlalu 'too',
terlambat 'late', terhadap 'towards', terutama 'especially',
termasuk 'including'.
Verbs with circumfix ke-...-an
1.276 With a few exceptions these verbs are adversatives;
they indicate that the subject undergoes an unpleasant or
undesired experience or event.
Unlike basic verbs, adversative verbs explicitly focus attention
on the adverse effect of the event on the subject. The
following two sentences can be translated in the same way:
   Mobil Tomo dicuri.
   Tomo kecurian mobil.
   Tomo's car was stolen.
However, the first sentence is simply a statement of what
happened to Tomo's car, while the second sentence
specifically indicates that Tomo undergoes something
unpleasant. It could more literally be translated, 'Tomo
suffered the stealing of his car', Tomo had his car stolen', or
Tomo was robbed of his car'.
There is only a limited number of adversative verbs and new
formations are not common. In colloquial speech numerous
forms occur with ke-...-an under Javanese influence, where
standard Indonesian has prefix ter-. These are not discussed
here. The few forms occurring in standard speech which have
ter- equivalents are, however, discussed in the following
sections.
A number of subgroups can be recognised, based on the
relationships between the constituents.
1.277 Verbs in this subgroup (subgroup 1) derive from
basic intransitive verbs in clauses whose subject noun phrase
contains a head noun and a possessor, such as the following:
   Uang Tomo hilang.
   Tomo's money is lost.
The possessor of the basic construction - Tomo in the above
example - becomes subject of the ke-...-an verb and the
original head noun - uang in the above example - is
expressed as a complement (see 3.65) following the verb:
   Tomo kehilangan uang.
   Tomo has lost his money (Tomo has suffered the loss of
   his money).
Other verbs in this group include:
   kehabisan suffer from (complement) being used up, run
     out of (complement)
   kematian suffer the death of (complement)
   kekurangan suffer a deficiency of (complement), lack
     (complement)
Also in this subgroup is keguguran 'have a miscarriage
(literally: suffer the falling)'. This verb does not have a
complement, as it is understood:
    Ibu Asma keguguran tadi malam.
    Mrs Asma had a miscarriage last night.
Although the complement is always something possessed by
the subject, possessive -nya is rare, but can occur:
   Mereka kematian ayah(nya).
   They have lost their father.
These verbs must be distinguished from nouns derived from
similar bases with ke*...-an (see 1.77). These nouns, such as
kematian 'death' in the following example, occur in different
environments from the verbs:
   Kematian ayahnya sangat menyedihkan.
   The death of his father was very saddening.
1.278 Verbs in this subgroup (subgroup 2) correspond to
transitive passive verbs. Like verbs described in 1.277 they
have a complement indicating something possessed by the
subject. An example with kecurian 'suffer from the theft of
(complement)' is given in section 1.276.
Other verbs in this subgroup include:
   kecopetan have (complement) stolen by a pickpocket
   kemalingan be burgled of (complement)
Unlike verbs in subgroup 1, these verbs can occur without a
complement:
  Saya kecopetan (dompet) di bus.
  I was pickpocketed (of my wallet) on the bus.
1.279 Subgroup 3 verbs are based on nouns. The subject
is adversely affected by what the base indicates. In the
following sentence the subject is unpleasantly affected by
malam 'night
   Dia kemalaman di hutan.
   He was overtaken by night in the forest.
Other verbs in this group include:
   kehujanan be caught in the rain
   kesiangan be overtaken by daylight
   kebanjiran be flooded
  ketulangan have a bone caught in the throat
  keracunan be poisoned
  kecanduan be addicted
The verb kegelapan 'overtaken by the dark' belongs in this
group although it has an adjective base. Some of these verbs
also occur in subgroup 5 (see 1.281).
1.280 Subgroup 4 verbs are based on adjectives. The
subject suffers from what the base indicates to a severe
degree. The difference between the adjective alone and the
verb derived from it is shown in the following examples:
   Dia lapar.
   He is hungry.
   Dia kelaparan.
   He is famished/starving.
Other verbs in this group include:
  kepanasan suffer from heat, be overcome by heat
   kedinginan suffer extremely from cold
  kehausan suffer from severe thirst
   kesakitan be in pain
   kesepian be lonely
  ketakutan be terrified
These verbs must be distinguished from homophonous nouns
derived from the same adjectives (see 1.73). Thus ketakutan
'be terrified' is homophonous with ketakutan 'fear', although
they have a different distribution in sentences:
   Dia ketakutan.
   He is terrified.
   Dia hidup dalam ketakutan.
   He lives in fear.
They must also be distinguished from colloquial adjectives
meaning 'too [base] (see 1.123). Such adjectives have an
                       1inanimate subject while the verbs have a human subject:
   Kami kedinginan tadi malam.
   We were freezing last night.
   Air ini kedinginan bagi saya.
   This water is too cold for me.
1.281 Subgroup 5 verbs have the same meaning as
corresponding basic verbs with affixation di-...-i, except that
the action is explicitly adversative, the difference being shown
by the following:
   Bu Hartini didatangi wartawan.
   Mrs Hartini was visited by a journalist.
   Bu Hartini kedatangan wartawan.
   Mrs Hartini was unexpectedly visited by a journalist.
With verbs in this subgroup the noun following the verb is the
agent. If it is perceived as the human instigator of the action,
the actor (see 3.17), then it can be preceded by oleh 'by', as in
the first example below. If, however, it is inanimate, as in the
second example below, then the use of oleh is unacceptable to
many people:
   Dia ketahuan (oleh) ayahnya.
   He was found out by his father.
   Dia kejatuhan durian.
   He was hit by a falling durian fruit.
Other verbs in this subgroup include:
   kedapatan be discovered, caught in the act
   kemasukan be possessed, infiltrated
   ketularan be infected, contaminated
   ketumbuhan be overgrown with
   ketumpahan be spilled on
The verbs ketahuan and kedapatan allow a verbal
complement (see 3.72):
  Dia kedapatan menggelapkan uang negara.
  He was caught embezzling state funds.
   Pemilik toko itu ketahuan oleh polisi menjual burung-
   burung kookaburra.
   The shop owner was caught by the police selling
   kookaburras.
A few verbs in subgroup 3 (section 1.279) can also occur in
subgroup 5. As subgroup 3 verbs they are based on nouns
and do not have an agent, while as subgroup 5 verbs they
correspond to di-...-i verbs and can have an agent. In the first
sentence below kebanjiran is based on the noun banjir 'flood   1and means 'subjected to flood (banjir)', while in the second
sentence it corresponds to dibanjiri 'be flooded' and occurs
with an agent:
   Kota itu kebanjiran.
   The town was flooded.
   Kota itu kebanjiran (oleh) turis asing.
   The town was flooded with foreign tourists.
Some other subgroup 5 verbs which also occur in subgroup 3
are given here with exemplary agents and corresponding
basic verbs:
   keracunan (permen basi) be poisoned (by spoiled sweets)
      (diracuni poisoned)
   kehujanan (batu) be rained on (by stones) (dihujani
      rained on)
1.282 Subgroup 6 includes several verbs whose subject is
not the person adversely affected but the thing possessed by
that person. In this respect they resemble ter- verbs (see
1.269). In the following sentence the person adversely
affected by kebongkaran 'be broken into' is saya 'I', the
possessor of the house:
   Rumah saya kebongkaran.
   My house was broken into.
The 'ter-like' character of these verbs is seen with kebakaran
'catch fire, be burned' which has the same meaning as
terbakar:
    Kapal itu kebakaran/terbakar.
   The ship caught fire.
With ketinggalan 'be left behind' a person can be subject only
if he or she is the 'thing' left behind:
    Saya ketinggalan bis.
    I missed the bus. (literally: I was left behind by the bus.)
1.283 Two ke-...-an verbs are not adversative. These are
kelihatan 'can be seen, visible; looks, seems' and kedengaran
'can be heard, audible; sounds, seems':
   Rumahnya tidak kelihatan dari sini.
   His house can't be seen from here.
   Musik itu kedengaran dari jalan.
   The music can be heard from the road.
Meaning 'can be seen/heard' these verbs function like passive
verbs and can take an agent. If the agent is a pronoun
occurrence of oleh 'by' is obligatory (see 3.32):
   Musik itu kedengaran olehku.
   I could hear the music.
These verbs can have a verbal compliment (see example in
3.76).
If the verb means 'seems (looks/sounds)' it cannot take an
agent (being intransitive in this function); it can have an
adjectival complement (see 3.69) and can take -nya:
   Supomo kelihatan(nya) sakit.
   Supomo looks sick.
1.284 Acting like kelihatan are the affixless verbs nampak
and tampak 'can be seen, visible' (with -nya these mean
'seems, looks' and function as sentence adjuncts - see 4.107):
    Umi tampak/nampak olehku duduk dengan Fatimah dan
    Salamah.
    I could see Umi sitting with Fatimah and Salamah.
Verbs with prefix ke-
1.285 There are only a few verbs occurring with prefix ke.
The prefix is a borrowing from Javanese and all these verbs
are regarded as non-standard to some degree by many
people. Almost all ke- verbs correspond to ter- accidental
       14verbs. A very few, including the first two listed below,
correspond to other forms. More standard forms having the
same meaning as ke- verbs are given in parentheses for the
following examples:
   ketemu (bertemu) meet
   ketimbang (dibandingkan dengan) compared with
   ketawa (tertawa) laugh
   kesohor (tersohor) famous
   ketipu (tertipu) tricked
   ketabrak (tertabrak) collided with
   kesasar (tersasar) lost, astray
   kepergok (tepergok) caught red handed
     Chaer (1988: 303) advises against the use of forms like ketipu
     'tricked' and ketabrak 'collided with', advising that ter- forms,
     such as tertipu and tertabrak, be used instead
2 PHRASES
2.1       This chapter describes phrases and other
constructions which combine to form clauses (clauses are
described in Chapter Three). A phrase is a group of words
which is grammatically equivalent to a single word, being able
to occur in the same places as that word. The phrase contains
a word of the class to which it is equivalent. This word is the
head or head word of the phrase, the rest of the phrase being
built around it. The phrase type is identified by the word
class of its head. Thus a noun phrase contains a noun, an
adjective phrase contains an adjective, and so on.","[134, 135, 136, 137, 138, 139, 140, 141, 142, 143, 144, 145, 146, 147, 148, 149, 150, 151, 152, 153, 154, 155]"
"PREPOSITIONS AND PREPOSITIONAL
PHRASES
2.118 A prepositional phrase consists of a preposition and
a noun phrase. The preposition links the following noun
phrase to another component of the sentence. At the clause
level the preposition shows the relationship of the following
noun phrase to the predicate.
Locative prepositions
2.119 Among the most important prepositions are those
which indicate position and direction. These are the locative
prepositions. There are three basic locative prepositions: di,
ke, and dari. The first, di 'in, at, on indicates that the action
                                      1occurs in the place indicated by the following noun; there is
no movement. Preposition ke 'to' indicates movement toward
and dari 'from indicates movement away:
               1   Dia tinggal di kota.
   He lives in the city.
   Dia berangkat dari kota.
   He set off from the city.
   Dia berjalan ke kota.
   He walked to the city.
These can combine with a set of locative pronouns, which
indicate position in relation to the speaker. The locative
pronouns are sini 'here (near speaker)', situ 'there (not far
off)\ and sana 'there (far off)'. The combination of the three
locative prepositions and three locative pronouns produces a
nine-way distinction of location and direction, including:
   di sini (at) here
   ke situ to there (close)
   dari sana from there (far)
The locative prepositions also combine with the question word
mana 'where' (see 4.17).
2.120 The three locative prepositions also combine with a
set of locative nouns which indicate location in relation to the
following noun. The locative nouns include:
   atas top, above               bawah beneath
   depan front                   muka front
   samping side                  dalam inside
   antara between                luar outside
   tepi edge                     belakang back
   seberang other side           sebelah side
Examples in sentences are:
  Dia muncul dari belakang rumah.
  She appeared from behind the house.
  Di sebelah rumah ada pohon mangga.
  At the side of the house there is a mango tree.
  Mereka berenang ke seberang sungai.
  They swam to the other side of the river (They swam
  across the river).
The locative noun can be omitted from such constructions if
it refers to a position which is normally understood; thus di
laci for di dalam laci 'in(side) the drawer , di meja for di atas
                                           1meja 'on (top of) the table'. If, however, some other position
is referred to the locative noun is necessary: di bawah meja
'under the table'.
Locative nouns indicating 'side' can be made more specific by
such words as kanan 'right', kiri left', utara 'north', and so on:
   di sebelah kiri rumah on the left side of the house
2.121 For many speakers di is omitted before a locative
noun if figurative space is referred to; in this case the locative
noun occurs alone as a preposition:
   tokoh dalam cerita itu
   the character in that story
   perbedaan antara kedua kata itu
   the difference between those two words
2.122 The locative preposition dari is also used for
figurative direction away:
   Mereka melindungi anaknya dari tentara.
   They protected their children from the army.
2.123 When the following noun refers to a person ke is
replaced by kepada 'to :
                       1   Dia memberikan surat itu kepada ayahnya.
   She gave the letter to her father.
2.124 The word pada is usually used instead of di when
location in time is referred to:
   Dia datang pada jam tiga.
   He came at three o'clock.
   Kami akan berangkat pada tanggal dua.
   We will leave on the second.
There is an increasing tendency for di to be used for some
references to time, including before the words hari 'day ,    1bulan 'month', tahun 'year' followed by a proper noun,
although some people regard use of di here as substandard:
    pada/di bulan Desember in December
In such contexts dalam may also occur:
   Kapal itu tenggelam pada/di/dalam tahun 1985.
   The ship sank in 1985.
Besides its use in reference to time pada is used in other
contexts of figurative space:
   Saya tertarik pada pelajaran itu.
   I'm interested in that subject.
   Perubahan-perubahan itu terjadi pada semua bahasa.
   Those changes occur in all languages.
Pada is sometimes used instead of kapada:
  Berikan surat itu pada saya.
  Give that letter to me.
2.125 The form kemari '(to) here', as in Datang kemari!
'Come here!', is written as a single word because mari does not
occur with the other locative prepositions; it means the same
as ke sini.
Other prepositions
2.126 There are many prepositions apart from the
locatives. A number occur in clause adjuncts, as discussed in
sections 2.165ff. A few of the more common non-locative
prepositions are:
   untuk, bagi, guna, buat for
   dengan with
   tentang about, concerning
   oleh by
   sampai until
   seperti like
   tanpa without
Some prepositions are complex, including a prefix:
  terhadap towards
  beserta together with
  sesudah, setelah after
Some also function as verbs, as indicated in parentheses:
  menurut according to (follow)
  mengenai about, concerning (affect, concern)
  lewat via (pass by)
A few consist of two words:
   oleh karena because of, on account of
   bersama dengan together with
The forms kepada 'to and daripada 'than, of consist of two
                      1words written as one.
2.127 A number of words function both as conjunctions
(see 4.69) and prepositions. As conjunctions they link a
subordinate clause to the main clause in a sentence; as
prepositions they link a noun phrase to the predicate. In the
first example below karena 'because' is a conjunction,
followed by a subordinate clause; in the second it is a
preposition followed by a noun phrase:
    Dia tidak datang karena ayahnya meninggal.
    He didn't come because his father died.
   Dia tidak datang karena kematian ayahnya.
    He didn't come because of the death of his father.
Among other words which can function as both preposition
and conjunction are:
   sebab because
  sebelum before
  sesudah after
  sehabis after
  selama during
  dengan by means of, with
2.128 Not all Indonesian prepositions consistently translate
one English preposition. The preposition terhadap illustrates
the variety of correspondences which might occur. This does
not result from any vagueness in the meaning of terhadap;
the meaning 'directed at' is discernible in all these contexts:
   sangsi terhadap orang yang melanggar kebiasaan
   sanctions against people who violate custom
   sikapnya terhadap tamu-tamunya
   his attitude to/towards his guests
   jengkel terhadap dirinya sendiri
   annoyed at himself
   perlakuan Iran terhadap para sandera
   Iran's treatment of the hostages
   berminat terhadap sejarah
   interested in history
   perang terhadap perjudian
   war on/against gambling
   kemenangan terhadap Jepang
   victory over Japan
   kebencian terhadap mereka
   hatred of/towards them
2.129 The preposition oleh 'by' marks the agent of a
passive verb (see 3.27) and the agent attribute in a noun
phrase (see 2.53). It can sometimes follow an intransitive
verb, in which case it can be regarded as a contraction of oleh
karena 'as a result of, because of :
   Ratusan juta orang akan tewas oleh ledakan, radiasi,
   wabah penyakit dan kelaparan.
   Hundreds of millions of people will die as a result of
   explosions, radiation, epidemics and hunger
It can sometimes occur with an adjective predicate, being
synonymous with dengan 'with':
   Stadion penuh sesak oleh orang yang datang untuk
   menonton pertandingan.
   The stadium was packed with people who had come to see
   the match.
If, however, dengan indicates instrument or means oleh
cannot alternatively occur:
    Mereka bepergian dengan kapal laut.
    They travelled by ship.
2.130 A number of intransitive verbs take a following
preposition, being equivalent in meaning to transitive verbs
with suffix -i. These are further discussed in section 1.219.
With some of these verbs there is considerable freedom as to
which prepositions it can take. In particular, akan and pada
are frequently interchangeable. The following are some
examples:
   cinta akan/pada love
   percaya akan/pada believe in
   kenal akan/dengan know, be acquainted with
   curiga akan/pada/terhadap be suspicious of
Colloquially sama can replace all the above prepositions.
2.131 The preposition antara 'between' may be followed
by coordinated noun phrases, in which case dengan is usually
the coordinator. Examples are given in section 2.207.","[217, 218, 219, 220, 221, 222]"
"Complements
3.61 A complement is a clause component which
resembles an object but which cannot become the subject of a
passive clause. Complements occur in transitive and
intransitive clauses and also in adjective clauses. A
complement can be an adjective phrase, a noun phrase or a
verbal clause. A complement is almost always obligatory to
the construction in which it occurs. Thus Ibu mulai 'Mother
began' is incomplete because it does not state what mother
began doing. The verb mulai requires a verbal complement:
Ibu mulai berbicara 'Mother began to speak'. Only some
ber- verbs, mentioned in section 3.64, have optional
complements.
For convenience of description, noun and adjective
complements are mentioned in sections 3.62-71, separate
from verbal complements, which are described in sections
3.72-6. Complements introduced by untuk are discussed in
3.77-9, complements introduced by supaya or agar in
section 3.80 and those introduced by sebagai in 3.82-3.
Complements of adjective clauses are discussed separately in
sections 3.83-5.
Noun and adjective complements
3.62 Noun and adjective complements can occur with
both intransitive and transitive verbs. Occurrence with
intransitive verbs is described in sections 3.63-70 and with
transitive verbs in section 3.71. Complement noun phrases
include bahwa clauses (see 3.66), and indirect questions (see
3.67).
Noun and adjective complements of intransitive verbs
3.63 In Indonesian a transitive and an intransitive verb
sometimes have the same meaning or similar meanings:
   Banyak siswa belajar bahasa Perancis.
   Banyak siswa mempelajari bahasa Perancis.
   Many students study French.
Only the transitive verb has a passive counterpart:
  Bahasa Perancis dipelajari banyak siswa.
  French is studied by many students.
In the above example bahasa Perancis 'French' is the object
of the transitive verb mempelajari 'study' and can be the
subject of its passive transformation dipelajari 'studied'.
However, belajar is an intransitive verb with no passive
counterpart. Following belajar the phrase bahasa Perancis is
a complement, not an object.
Most intransitive verbs with complements correspond to
English transitive verbs with objects. Thus belajar translates
the English transitive verbs 'study' and 'learn'.
3.64 Among intransitive verbs with noun phrase
complements are numerous ber- verbs. Thus the verb
beternak 'breed animals' can take a noun complement which
specifies which particular animals are bred, such as beternak
ayam 'breed chickens'. In section 1.176 are mentioned ber-
verbs which have a compound base, such as bercelana
panjang 'wear long trousers'. The bases of such verbs also
occur as noun phrases, in this case celana panjang 'long
trousers', and thus do not constitute a verb and complement.
On the other hand, ternak ayam is not a possible phrase and
cannot be regarded as a compound base; ayam must be
treated as a complement to the verb beternak.
Many of the verbs in this group take an optional complement,
especially those with noun bases. Thus beternak can occur at
the end of a sentence without a following noun: Ayah saya
beternak 'My father breeds animals'. Others, especially those
with verb bases, must take a complement, such as bertukar
(pikiran) 'exchange (ideas)'. Other examples, with illustrative
complements in parentheses are:
   berbicara (bahasa Jepang) speak (Japanese)
   bermain (olah raga) play (sport)
   berpakaian (piyama) wear (pyjamas)
   bernyanyi (lagu) sing (a song)
   berisi (air) contain (water)
   berpindah (tempat) change (places), move (house)
   berdagang (barang-barang berharga) trade (in valuable
      goods)
   berumur (delapan tahun) be aged (eight years)
   bernama (Idrus) be named (Idrus)
   bertanam (jagung) plant (corn)
   berburu (rusa) hunt (deer)
   berjual (ikan) sell (fish), engage in selling (fish) for a
      living
Many of these complements refer to a class of things in
general, such as in the above example, where ayam refers to
poultry in general, not to a specific chicken. Some of these
forms contrast with transitive verbs which take an object which
can refer to a specific instance. Thus bertanam (jagung)
'plant (corn)' refers to a general state or occupation, whereas
menanam jagung (itu) 'plant (that) corn' may refer to a single
action; berburu rusa means 'carry out the activity of hunting
deer', and cannot refer to the hunting of a particular deer,
whereas memburu rusa (itu) 'hunt (that) deer' can.
3.65 Besides ber- verbs, many simple and m e N -
intransitive verbs take noun phrases as complements. With
these verbs the complement is obligatory. The following
examples include illustrative complements:
   menjadi (presiden) become (president)
   punya (uang) have (money)
   suka (kopi) like (coffee)
   mau (teh) want (tea)
   tahu (hal itu) know (that matter)
   merangkap (menteri keuangan) double as (minister of
      finance)
   menyangkut (masalah politik) involve (political matters)
Several verbs with suffixes do not have a passive form and are
thus intransitive, occurring with a complement. These are
mentioned in section 3.25.
A number of intransitive verbs can take a complement noun
phrase instead of a prepositional noun phrase (see also
1.219). Thus ke dalam 'into' can be omitted from the
following:
   Dia masuk (ke dalam) rumah.
   He entered the house.
Apart from simple primary verbs a number of secondary
verbs take complements. These include some reciprocal verbs
(see 1.248 and 1.255), ber-...-kan verbs (see 1.262ff), and
some ke-...-an verbs (see 1.276flf).
3.66 Intransitive report verbs can have bahwa clauses as
complements (see 3.111):
   Saya yakin bahwa dia pencuri.
   I am sure that he is a thief.
   Saya berharap bahwa anda berhasil.
   I hope that you succeed.
This group of verbs includes:
   tahu know             berkata say
 ' percaya believe       sadar be aware
   ingat remember        berpendapat have the opinion
   berpikir think        lupa forget
   beranggapan have the opinion, consider
A few of these verbs, such as berkata 'say' and berpikir
'think', can alternatively have a direct quote as complement
(see 3.95).
3.67 Indirect questions (see 4.27) can also occur as
complements:
   Saya tidak tahu apakah dia akan datang.
   I don't know whether he will come.
3.68 With intransitive verbs reciprocity can be indicated
by the complement satu sama Iain (literally: 'one with the
other'):
   Mereka kenal satu sama Iain.
   They know each other.
3.69 The number of intransitive verbs which can occur
with adjective complements is limited:
   Mereka merasa puas.
   They feel satisfied.
   Kakinya terasa sakit.
   His foot feels sore.
Other verbs include kelihatan 'looks, seems' and kedengaran
'sounds, seems' (see 1.283).
3.70 The verb menjadi 'be; become' can have both noun
and adjective complements:
   Suprapto sudah lama menjadi guru.
   Suprapto has been a teacher for a long time.
   Bapak menjadi marah.
   Father became angry.
Noun and adjective complements of transitive verbs
3.71 Some transitive verbs allow a complement to follow
the object; this is usually called an object complement. The
relationship between the object and object complement is that
of subject and predicate. The complement can be an
adjective phrase or a noun phrase:
   Perbuatannya menjadikan ibunya sedih.
   His actions made his mother sad.
   Mereka menganggapnya munafik.
   They consider him a hypocrite.
Some verbs, such as membuat 'make and mengira 'consider,
                                      1reckon', can take either an adjective phrase or noun phrase as
complement:
   Dia membuat saya marah/asistennya.
   He made me angry/his assistant.
   Orang sekampung mengira dia gila/pencuri.
   The village people consider him mad/a thief.
Verbal complements
3.72 Some verbs can have a verbal clause as a
complement. In this situation two verbs occur within the one
clause. To distinguish them the terms main verb and
complement verb are used here. In the clause Ibu mulai
berbicara 'Mother began to speak' the main verb (sometimes
called the superordinate verb) is mulai, while the complement
verb (sometimes called the subordinate verb) is berbicara.
Verbal complements follow an intransitive verb, as discussed
in section 3.73. They follow the object of a transitive verb, as
discussed in section 3.76.
Verbal complements of intransitive verbs
3.73 The verbal complement of an intransitive verb can
itself be intransitive, as in the first two examples below, or
transitive, as in the last two examples. The main verb and the
complement verb have the same subject:
    Saya sudah berhenti merokok.
    I've stopped smoking.
    Siti mulai menangis.
    Siti began to cry.
    Siti ikut membantu ayah.
    Siti joined in helping father.
    Dia lupa menulis namanya.
    He forgot to write his name.
If the complement verb is transitive it can be active, as in the
above examples, or passive:
    Keputusan pemerintah mulai dibicarakan.
    The government decision began to be discussed.
    Tesisnya selesai diperbaiki.
    His thesis is finished being corrected.
If the complement verb is active the subject is the actor of the
complement verb as well as of the main verb; Siti is actor of
the main verb mulai 'begin' and of the complement verb
menangis 'cry' in Siti mulai menangis 'Siti began to cry'. If
the complement verb is passive the subject is its patient;
keputusan pemerintah 'the government decision' is patient of
dibicarakan 'discussed' in Keputusan pemerintah mulai
dibicarakan 'The government decision began to be
discussed'.
3.74 When some verbs, including berhasil 'succeed' and
gagal 'fail', occur with a passive complement verb, they
express what the actor of the complement verb succeeds or
fails in doing, not what their own subject succeeds or fails in
doing:
    Tujuh anggota komplotan berhasil diringkus polisi.
    Police succeeded in catching seven members of the gang.
   Dia gagal diselamatkan.
    (They) failed to save him.
3.75 If mau 'want' and ingin 'want, wish' have a passive
complement ambiguity occurs as to whether it is the subject
or the agent of the complement who wants the action to
occur. While the first sentence below is unambiguous the
second means either that Bill wants to be helped or that Ali
wants to help him:
   Ali mau menolong Bill.
   Ali wants to help Bill.
   Bill mau ditolong Ali.
   Bill wants to be helped by Ali. or Ali wants to help Bill.
In practice context makes the meaning clear. Thus, while the
first sentence below is ambiguous without a context, meaning
either that beliau doesn't want to be interviewed or that saya
does not want to interview, the second sentence occurs in a
context which indicates that beliau is the one who does not
want to be interviewed:
    Beliau tidak mau saya wawancarai.
    I don't want to interview him. or He doesn't want me to
    interview him.
   Kalau beliau tidak mau saya wawancarai, tidak apa-
   apa.
   If he doesn't want me to interview him it doesn't matter.
The first sentence below would automatically be interpreted as
meaning that the agent of bunuh 'kill' wants to perform the
act, while the second, which occurs with question intonation,
clearly means that the subject wants the act to be performed:
   Kau mau kubunuh.
   I want to kill you.
   Kau mau kubunuh, ya?
   You want me to kill you, eh?
If the subject is inanimate the one who wants is clearly the
agent of the complement:
    Ini bagian kalimat yang ingin ditegaskannya.
    This is the part of the sentence which he wanted to
   emphasise.
Verbal complements of transitive verbs
3.76 As mentioned in section 3.71, the complement of a
transitive verb follows the object and is sometimes called an
object complement. The object of the main verb is subject of
the complement verb. Thus in the first example below
anaknya 'his children' is object of menyuruh and subject of
pergi:
   Suwono menyuruh anaknya pergi ke sekolah.
   Suwono ordered his children to go to school.
   Polisi menghentikan para demonstran memasuki
   kampus.
   The police stopped the demonstrators entering the campus.
As the main verb is transitive it can be made passive. Its
object becomes the subject in the normal way (see 3.26).
However, the complement remains after the main verb. In
such constructions the subject is patient of the main verb and
actor of the complement verb. The first two examples below
of passive main verbs with complements are preceded by their
active counterparts. The final example has a transitive ke-...-
an verb (see 1.283):
   Dia menyuruh saya pergi.
   He ordered me to go.
   Saya disuruh pergi.
   I was ordered to go.
   Mereka menugasi saya melakukan observasi.
   They assigned me to carry out observations.
   Saya ditugasi mereka melakukan observasi.
   I was assigned by them to carry out observations.
   Bangkai mobil dibiarkan bertumpuk.
   Car wrecks were allowed to pile up.
   Pak Sarif ditunjuk pemerintah mengurus pabrik itu.
   Mr Sarif was appointed by the government to manage the
   factory.
   Pak Sujud kelihatan membakar kemenyan.
   Mr Sujud could be seen burning incense.
Complements with untuk
3.77 Some complement verbs refer to an action which
occurs in the future with respect to the main verb, which can
be intransitive or transitive. The complement can optionally
be preceded by untuk. Untuk clauses are discussed in
3.113ff.
3.78 Although untuk can always be omitted from a
complement (see 3.116) it cannot always be added; many
transitive verbs do not allow an untuk clause as complement.
These include verbs whose complement verb refers to an
action taking place at the same time as the main verb. In this
category are verbs of perception, such as melihat 'see ,    1mendengar 'hear', mengamati 'observe', and numerous other
verbs, such as mempergoki 'catch'. These verbs take an object
complement as described in 3.76:
   Polisi mengamatinya menelpon sejumlah orang dari
   terminal.
   Police observed him telephone a number of people from
   the terminal.
   Kami mempergoki dia sedang mencoba membuka
   lemari besi.
   We caught him trying to open a safe.
3.79 Complements with untuk must be distinguished from
subordinate clauses beginning with untuk (and guna). The
complement is an essential part of the clause; if it is omitted
the construction is incomplete. On the other hand a
subordinate clause, while adding further information, is not
obligatory. A further difference is that untuk is optional
before a complement but obligatory before a subordinate
clause. Subordinate clauses introduced by untuk are
discussed in 4.74.
Complements with supaya and agar
3.80 Transitive and intransitive verbs which indicate that
the subject intends someone else to perform an action can
take a complement introduced by supaya, agar or, more
formally, agar supaya 'that, so that'. Verbs which can take a
complement introduced by supaya/agar include:
   ingin want, desire           menghendaki want
   berharap hope                menyuruh order, tell
   hendak want                  mempersilakan invite
   mau want                     memerintakhan instruct
   berkeinginan desire          meng(h)imbau appeal
   berpesan instruct            menyerukan appeal
   berusaha endeavour          menasihati advise
   bercita-cita desire          (me)mohon request
   mendesak urge                (me)minta request
   mengajak invite, urge        mengusulkan suggest
   menuntut demand
   menginginkan want, desire
   mengharapkan hope, expect
   menginstruksikan instruct
Clauses introduced by supaya/agar are discussed in 3.119ff.
3.81 Complements with s u p a y a / a g a r must be
distinguished from subordinate clauses beginning with the
same conjunction. The complement is an essential part of the
clause; if it is omitted the construction is incomplete. On the
other hand a subordinate clause, while adding further
information, is not obligatory. Subordinate clauses
introduced by supaya or agar are discussed in 4.74.
Complements with sebagai
3.82 While similar to an adjunct, a prepositional phrase
with sebagai is essential to the meaning of the clause, which is
therefore incomplete without it. As such these constructions
are complements, which link directly to either the subject or
object of the clause.
A complement with sebagai can occur with some intransitive
verbs to indicate what role or function the subject has:
   Dia bekerja di sana sebagai tukang kayu.
   He works there as a carpenter.
   Bahasa Indonesia berfungsi sebagai alat pemersatu
   bangsa.
   Indonesian functions as the national unifier.
The complement can occur with some transitive verbs and
describes the role of the patient or what the patient's role is
thought to be. The patient can be object of an active clause
or subject of a passive clause:
   Harian Kompas memandang keputusan pemerintah
   sebagai langkah mundur.
   The daily Kompas regards the government decision as a
   backward step.
   Panitia memilih Djunawi sebagai ketua sidang pleno.
   The committee chose Djunawi as the president of the
   general session.
   Mereka dicap sebagai bandit.
   They were branded as bandits.
   Kacong dianggap polisi sebagai penjahat.
   Kacong was considered by the police to be a criminal.
Complements of adjective clauses
3.83 There are two types of verbal complement in
adjectival clauses. In one type the subject of the main clause
is also actor of the complement verb, discussed in 3.84. In
the other the subject of the main clause stands as patient of
the complement verb, discussed in 3.85.
3.84 A limited number of adjectives can take an active
verb as a complement. The adjective then indicates the
manner in which the subject performs the action. In these
constructions the adjective is the predicate centre and can be
negated; it does not function as an adverb within a verbal
clause. The following verb usually occurs as a 'to-infinitive*
verb in the English translation. Adjectives which can take
such a complement include pandai 'clever, capable'
(translated in this construction as 'able, capable'), berani
'brave' (translated in this construction as 'dare'), and gembira
'delighted':
    Ratna pandai berenang.
    Ratna is able to swim.
    Dia tidak berani membantah pendapat guru.
    He wouldn't dare contradict the teacher's opinion.
    Saya gembira mendengar berita itu.
    I was delighted to hear the news.
Other adjectives able to take such complements include:
  takut afraid                    malu embarrassed
  senang happy                    bangga proud
  segan reluctant                 cenderung inclined
3.85 A limited number of adjectives can take a verbal
complement in which the verb is passive and the adjective
describes the way in which the subject noun undergoes the
action. Adjectives occurring in this construction include
sukar 'difficult', sulit 'difficult' and mudah 'easy'. Untuk
optionally begins the complement:
   Tulisan saudara sulit (untuk) dibaca.
   Your writing is hard to read.
   Kata-kata baru ini sukar (untuk) saya ingat.
   These new words are hard for me to remember.
   Jawabannya tidak mudah dimengerti.
   His answer wasn't easy to understand.
Other adjectives taking such complements include:
  menarik interesting           enak pleasant
  gampang easy                  patut appropriate
  baik good
In Indonesian a verb must be passive if the subject noun
identifies its patient. This is also the case where the verb
occurs at a lower level, as in the above constructions. Thus, in
the first example above tulisan 'writing stands as patient of
                                          1the verb 'read'; the verb must therefore be in its passive form
dibaca. (This rule does not apply in English, where the verb
is usually active, as in the above examples.) This rule also
applies in relative clauses, and is further discussed in relation
to such constructions (see 3.99).
These constructions can be transformed into the constructions
discussed in sections 3.10-11.
The modifying adverbs terlalu and cukup are possible, in
which case many more adjectives can occur than those given
above. Untuk obligatorily introduces the complement:
   Sepatu ini terlalu mahal untuk kami beli.
   These shoes are too expensive for us to buy.
   Papaya ini sudah cukup masak untuk dimakan.
   This papaw is already ripe enough to eat.","[293, 294, 295, 296, 297, 298, 299, 300, 301, 302, 303, 304, 305]"
"Full reduplication
1.10        A word, whether simple or complex, can be fully
reduplicated. Full reduplication involves repeating the entire
word. The two parts of the word are separated by a hyphen in
writing and the second is treated as the reduplicated part.
Free bases can be reduplicated: buku-buku, tinggi-tinggi,
duduk-duduk.
A word consisting of an affix or more than one affix plus
base can be reduplicated: perubahan-perubahan (from base
ubah), tulisan-tulisan (from base tulis).
A base can be reduplicated and affixes can then be added to
the reduplicated base: kemerah-merahan (from base merah),
berkali-kali (from base kali), sebesar-besarnya (from base
besar), melihat-lihat (from base lihat).
Full reduplication has many functions. Sometimes
reduplication of bases cannot be discussed separately from a
consideration of the affixes with which it occurs. For
instance, the function of the reduplication of the bases in
kuda-kudaan 'toy horse and sebesar-besarnya 'as big as
                          1possible is dependent on the particular combination of base
        1and affix and cannot be described free from the overall forms
in which it occurs. Such reduplication is discussed under the
individual affixes. On the other hand, most full reduplication
of words, whether simple or complex, and of some bases in
complex words, can be described free from a consideration of
the particular affixes accompanying it. Such reduplication is
discussed in the following sections.
Reduplication without corresponding single bases
1*11 Sometimes reduplicated forms have no
unreduplicated counterparts to which they can be related.
Such forms are often treated as single bases in dictionaries,
although usually written with a hyphen. Such forms include
tiba-tiba 'suddenly', sia-sia 'futile', pura-pura 'pretend',
megap-megap 'pant', masing-masing 'each'. Although single
bases with the same form sometimes occur these are chance
similarities. Thus the word tiba 'arrive' has no relationship (at
least in modern Indonesian) to tiba-tiba 'suddenly'.
Reduplication of nouns
1.12 Where a noun can occur singly or repeated the
reduplication has a number of functions, as discussed in
sections 1.13-4.
Some nouns consisting of repeated forms are of the type
mentioned in 1.11 and are thus single bases. Many of these
words are names of plants and animals, types of food, and
instruments, although such formations are not confined to
these categories: cumi-cumi 'squid', kupu-kupu 'butterfly',
alang-alang 'tall grass species', koma-koma 'saffron', gado-
gado 'mixed vegetable dish', ani-ani 'small harvest knife',
oleh-oleh 'gift'. Sometimes a reduplicated form refers to
something having two or more similar parts; a single base
rarely or never occurs: paru-paru 'lungs', baling-baling
'propeller', anting-anting 'ear ring'.
1.13 Reduplication may produce a meaning which is
different but nevertheless related to the meaning of the single
base. Dictionaries inconsistently list such reduplicated forms
under the single base or as separate entries. Such forms
include:
   gula sugar : gula-gula sweets
   laki husband : laki-laki man
   mata eye : mata-mata spy
   kuda horse : kuda-kuda easel; trestle
   langit sky : langit-langit ceiling
In a few cases such words can also indicate plurality (see
1.14). Thus kuda-kuda 'horses', mata-mata rantai 'links of a
chain'.
1.14 The major function of noun reduplication is to
indicate plurality. Both simple and complex nouns can be
reduplicated to indicate plurality: rumah-rumah 'houses',
singkatan-singkatan 'abbreviations', perubahan-perubahan
'changes .
        1
A noun is not usually reduplicated unless it is unclear from
context whether one or more than one is referred to and then
only if this is important to what the speaker wishes to convey.
In the first example below the number makes plurality
specific, while in the second sentence plurality is clear from
the general context; one does not usually buy a single shoe:
   Menteri mengunjungi tiga negeri asing.
   The minister visited three foreign countries.
   Saya harus membeli sepatu baru.
   I must buy new shoes.
Sometimes, however, a speaker does use reduplication even
though plurality is clear from context:
   Pulau-pulau Bali, Lombok dan Sumbawa terletak di
   sebelah timur pulau Jawa*
   The islands of Bali, Lombok and Sumbawa are located east
   of Java.
Reduplication does not occur if a whole class of things is
referred to. Neither noun in the following sentence can be
reduplicated:
   Anjing suka tulang.
   Dogs like bones.
It is sometimes stated that reduplication of nouns indicates
variety rather than plurality (although plurality is implied by
variety). Indonesian writers disagree on this question, but
clearly reduplication can be used where variety is of no
importance. In the following sentences there is no focus at all
on variation among the mango trees, links of the chain or
water containers; what is stressed is that there is more than
one:
   Rumahnya dekat pohon-pohon mangga itu.
   His house is near those mango trees.
   Mata-mata rantai berbentuk bulat.
   The links of the chain are round.
   Pada pinggangnya terikat bumbung-bumbung kosong.
   At his waist are tied empty bamboo water containers.
Reduplication is not normally used in reference to things
which come in pairs, such as certain body parts. Where it is
felt necessary to indicate plurality in such cases belah 'half;
one of something which comes in a pair' is usually used (see
2.26).
When a noun is followed by a modifying noun (see 2.37)
usually only the head noun is reduplicated:
   buku-buku sejarah history books
   toko-toko buku book shops
There is sometimes disagreement among Indonesians as to
whether or not a noun and modifying noun should both be
repeated; in some common combinations either the head
noun alone is repeated or both are, speakers differing as to
what is acceptable, thus: surat-surat kabar or surat kabar-
surat kabar 'newspapers'.
When a noun and a following possessive noun both refer to
more than one it is often possible to repeat either noun:
  Sebutkanlah nama-nama universitas yang termasuk
  SKALU.
  Sebutkanlah nama universitas-universitas yang termasuk
  SKALU.
  Give the names of the universities
                                 • •
                                      m SKALU. 2
Reduplication of pronouns
1.15 The following personal pronouns (see 2.66) can be
reduplicated: saya T, kami 'we (exclusive)', kita 'we
(inclusive)', kamu 'you', beliau 'he, she (respectful)', and
mereka 'they .
             1
For all these except mereka reduplication usually has a
belittling or disparaging connotation:     These sentences are taken from Simatupang (1983: 112).
     Indonesians display a great deal of uncertainty and disagreement as
     to what is permissible when reduplicating constructions involving
     two nouns (noun with following modifying or possessive noun).
     Simatupang presents a detailed consideration of this topic (1983*
      110-120).
   Mengapa hanya saya-saya yang selalu diberi tugas yang
   berat ini?
   Why is it always poor old me who gets these jobs?
   Jangan berbuat gaduh di sini, beliau-beliau sedang
   rapat!
   Don't be noisy, the big shots are having a meeting!
For mereka reduplication conveys emphasis; the pronoun is
usually followed by a relative clause introduced by yang:
   Mereka-mereka yang belum terdaftar harap lekas
   mendaftarkan diri.
   Those who aren't enrolled yet should enrol as soon as
   possible.3Reduplication of adjectives
1.16 Reduplication of an adjective usually occurs when
the noun it describes is plural; reduplication indicates that the
characteristic indicated by the adjective applies to all the
objects:
   Gambarmu bagus-bagus.
   Your drawings are beautiful.
   sekitar 230 pulau yang kecil-kecil ukurannya
   about 230 small islands
   hutan-rimba yang pohonnya tinggi-tinggi sekali
   a forest whose trees are very tall
1.17 A reduplicated adjective can occur alone,
functioning like a concessive clause introduced by meskipun
(see 4.76):
   Kecil-kecil, si Ali sudah pacaran.
   Although young, Ali already has a girl friend.
   Sakit-sakit, dia pergi juga ke sekolah.
   Although sick, he still went to school.
1.18 Reduplicated adjectives can function as adverbs (see
2.170):
   Anak itu berteriak keras-keras.
   The child screamed loudly.","[43, 44, 45, 46, 47]"
"Personal pronoun phrases
2.75 Personal pronoun phrases contain a limited number
of constituents, including those discussed below. In general
suffixed pronouns can occur with the same phrase elements as
      The first example is from Toer (1980: 28). Kaswanti Purwo (1984:
      114) rejects the use of mereka to refer to non-human nouns.
free pronouns. Prefixed pronouns cannot act as phrase
heads.
Demonstratives
2.76 The demonstrative ini gives emphasis to first person
pronouns:
   Kau kira saya ini pelayanmu?
   Do you think I am your servant?
With third person itu can occur to indicate location or
previous mention:
   mereka itu
   they (over there) or they (who have been mentioned)
Relative clauses in personal pronoun phrases
2.77 Adjectives must be preceded by yang in pronoun
phrases. They are thus relative clauses (see 3.98):
   saya yang kecil ini I who am small
   kamu yang pandai you who are clever
Apart from adjectives, relative clauses occur only after
mereka. In this case the pronoun acts like orang, meaning
'people who..., those who...':
   mereka yang tetap tinggal di desa
   those who continue to live in the village
   mereka yang tidak hadir
   those who are not present
Numbers in pronoun phrases
2.78 A limited number of definite and indefinite numbers
are the only quantifiers which occur with personal pronouns.
2.79 Numbers with prefix ber- (see 1.158) are the only
definite numbers which can accompany pronouns. Following
a pronoun they indicate a group, having the same meaning as
collective numbers with ke- preceding a noun (see 2.17):
   mereka berdua
   both of them
   Kita bertiga menghadap kepala sekolah.
   The three of us appeared before the school principal.
2.80 Several indefinite numbers (see 2.113) can occur
with pronouns, including semua 'air, sekalian 'all', masing-
masing 'each'. Although they precede nouns (see 2.19),
indefinite numbers follow pronouns:
   Mereka masing-masing memperoleh sebidang tanah.
   They each received a plot of land.
   Kami semua harus membuka jalan dahulu.
   All of us must clear a road first.
The indefinite number sekalian is sometimes used as a plural
indicator for second person: saudara/anda/engkau sekalian
'you (plural)'. However, it also occurs with other pronouns:
mereka sekalian 'all of them'.
Reflexive sendiri
2.81 This functions as with nouns (see 2.51):
   Ini rumahku sendiri.
   This is my own house.
As with nouns, sendiri can be separated from a pronoun
subject:
   Kamu sendiri harus pergi/Kamu harus pergi sendiri.
   You must go yourself.
Apposition
2.82 A pronoun can be in apposition (see 2.61) with a
noun phrase:
   kami, bangsa Indonesia
   we, the people of IndonesiaIndefinite pronouns
2.83 These indicate that a person or thing is being spoken
about without a particular person or thing being identified.
2.84 The pronouns seseorang and sesuatu correspond to
English 'someone' and 'something' respectively:
   Saya akan menyuruh seseorang menjemput mereka.
   I'll tell someone to meet them.
   Dia makan sesuatu.
   He ate something.
The phrase segala sesuatu 'everything refers to all the things
                                      1being discussed without them being named individually:
   Dia membicarakan segala sesuatu.
   He discussed everything.
Sesuata and segala sesuatu can take a relative clause (see
3.98):
   Ada sesuatu yang kurang baik.
   There is something which isn't good.
   Segala sesuatu yang dikatakannya selalu menarik.
   Everything he says is always interesting.
2.85 Corresponding to English indefinite pronouns
beginning with 'any' are forms consisting of a question word
(see 4.14) followed by saja. The interrogative mana follows
a locative preposition (see 2.119) or a noun:
   siapa saja anyone
   apa saja anything
   di/ke/dari mana saja (at/to/from) anywhere
   mana saja any
   kapan saja any time
   berapa saja any amount
   Siapa saja boleh ikut.
   Anyone can come along.
   Kamu boleh minum apa saja.
   You can drink anything.
   Taruh barang itu di mana saja.
   Put those things anywhere.
   Anda bisa bepergian ke mana saja.
   You can travel anywhere.
   Kalau libur kami menginap di hotel mana saja.
   When on holidays we stay in any hotel at all.
   Singgah di rumah kapan saja.
   Call in any time at all.
   Ambil berapa saja.
   Take any amount you like.
All the above interrogatives except kapan and berapa can be
followed by pun instead of saja:
    Sekarang koran bisa dibungkam untuk apa pun.
    Now a newspaper can be silenced for anything.
   Saya tidak bisa menerima pembredelan oleh siapa pun
   dan di mana pun.
   I cannot accept banning by anyone anywhere.
Many people write pun attached to the interrogative:
siapapun and so on.
2.86 The forms apa pun/apa saja and mana pun/mana
saja occur in a noun phrase after a negated predicate instead
of the reduplicated forms discussed in 2.89:
   Mereka tidak memberi informasi apa pun.
   They didn't give any information at all.
   Kami tidak berkunjung ke desa mana saja.
   We didn't visit any village at all.
Forms with saja also occur in questions but with a different
meaning (see 4.22).
2.87 Indefinite pronouns can be followed by a relative
clause (see 2.98) and almost invariably are if they occur in
subject position:
   Siapa pun yang berbuat onar akan ditindak.
   Anyone who causes trouble will be acted against.
   Apa saja yang diucapkannya selalu benar.
   Whatever he states is always correct.
2.88 Alternative to siapa saja and apa saja, though more
formal, are the forms barang siapa 'anyone' and barang apa
'anything'. These only occur as subjects of a clause and are
frequently followed by a relatived clause:
   Barang siapa yang bersalah harus dihukum.
   Anyone who is guilty must be punished.
   Barang apa yang diceritakannya selalu benar.
 , Anything she said was always true.
2.89 Reduplicated forms of siapa, apa, mana have the
same meanings as the forms mentioned in section 2.85 but
follow a negated predicate (reduplicated mana can also
follow a positive predicate - see 2.90):
   Saya tidak bertemu dengan siapa-siapa.
   I didn't meet anyone.
   Dia tidak tahu apa-apa.
   He doesn't know anything.
   Saya tidak pergi ke mana-mana.
   I didn't go anywhere.
If the indefinite pronoun occurs in a noun phrase following a
negated predicate then a form with saja or pun is more likely
to occur (see examples in 2.86).
If siapa-siapa and apa-apa occur as predicates they are
negated by bukan:
   Dalam sumber alam Taiwan bukan apa-apa
   dibandingkan dengan Indonesia.
   In natural resources Taiwan is nothing compared with
   Indonesia.
2.90 The reduplicated form (di/ke/dari) mana-mana can
also occur after a positive predicate, meaning '(at/to/from)
everywhere':
   Pengungsi itu datang dari mana-mana.
   The refugees came from everywhere.
2.91 The indefinite pronouns siapa-siapa and apa-apa
must follow a negated predicate, as mentioned in 2.89. They
therefore cannot occur in subject position. Instead the
following forms occur:
   tidak seorangpun no one
   tidak satupun nothing
This distribution of the forms is partly similar to that of forms
with 'not ... any(one)' and 'no (one)' in English, the difference
being illustrated by the first two sentences below:
   Saya tidak mengenal siapa-siapa di sini.
   I don't know anyone here.
   Tidak seorangpun mengenal saya di sini.
   No one knows me here.
   Tidak seorangpun tersenyum kepadanya.
   No one smiled at him.
   Tak satupun menarik perhatiannya.
   Nothing interested her.
The forms tidak seorangpun and tidak satupun can precede
a noun to mean 'not a single'; tidak satupun can occur with
both human and non-human nouns:
   Tidak seorangpun prajurit yang cedera.
   Not a single soldier was injured.
   Tidak satupun pengadilan yang akan menghukum dia.
   Not a single court will sentence him.
Such phrases can also follow a negated verb; in this case tidak
does not occur with the pronoun. In the following example
the verb ada 'exist' is negated by belum:
   Belum ada satupun desainer Indonesia yang mampu
   merancang padang golf bertaraf internasional.
   There is not yet a single Indonesian designer who can
   design an international class golf course.
2.92 Other classifiers can replace orang in tidak
seorangpun (see 2.91) as appropriate. Thus pucuk, the
classifier for guns (see 2.22), can occur with senapan:
   Tak sepucukpun senapan yang meletus.
   Not a single gun went off.","[196, 197, 198, 199, 200, 201, 202]"
"
      There is disagreement as to the acceptability of some forms. Thus
      Kamus Besar Bahasa Indonesia (1991) gives mencantikkan
      'make beautiful', whereas Dardjowidjojo (1983: 261) rules this out,
      allowing only mempercantik.
1.236 A small number of per- verbs are based on nouns
and mean 'treat the object as [base]' or 'take the object as
[base]'. Thus memperistri 'take as wife, marry':
   Saya tidak dapat memperistri gadis seperti dia.
   I can't marry a girl like hen
Other verbs in this group include:
  memperbudak enslave; treat like a slave
  mempersuami take as husband, marry
  memperalat make use of (someone); use as an instrument
  mempertuan treat as (one's) master
  memperkuda exploit, work (object) like a horse
  memperdewa deify, treat like a god, idolise
  memperadik regard as a younger sibling
1.237 Per- also occurs with cardinal numbers from 'two' to
'four' to derive verbs meaning 'cause to be so many parts,
divide into so many parts':
   memperdua divide into two parts
   mempertiga divide into three parts
   memperempat divide into four parts
Belonging to this group is memperbanyak 'multiply, increase
the number of:
   Mereka memperbanyak senjatanya.
   They increased the number of their weapons.
1.238 Two forms occur with verb bases:
   memperoleh get, obtain
   memperbuat do
Transitive verbs with affixation per-...-kan
1.239 This affixation occurs with some adjective bases to
produce causative verbs:
   mempermalukan shame, embarrass
   memperhebatkan intensify
   memperbesarkan enlarge
Where it occurs with adjective bases per-...-kan has the same
meaning as per- (see 1.235). Thus memperhebatkan could
be replaced by memperhebat in the following sentence:
   Serikat buruh memutuskan untuk memperhebatkan
   kampanye.
   The trade union has decided to intensify its campaign.
These verbs probably result from confusion between per- and
-kan forms and are not accepted by all speakers. Some, such
as mempermalukan, have wide acceptability and tend to be
included in dictionaries, while others, such as
memperbesarkan, tend to be excluded from dictionaries.
1.240 A very limited number of per-...-kan verbs occur
with noun bases. Some of these are synonymous with
memper- forms. Thus memperdewa, memperdewakan
'deify; idolise'. There is uncertainty about the meaning of two
forms; some people treat m e m p e r i s t r i k a n and
mempersuamikan as meaning the same as memperistri and
mempersuami respectively (see 1.236), while others make a
distinction, memperistri/suamikan meaning 'marry off
(son/daughter), cause (son/daughter) to take a spouse'. The
verb mempermadukan 'take a second wife, provide (wife)
with a co-wife', has no corresponding form without -kan.
Also in this group are the following:
   memperdebatkan debate (over)
   mempersoalkan dispute, question
   mempermasalahkan dispute, question
   mempersengketakan dispute, quarrel over
1.241 With verb bases per-...-kan has several functions.
With some bases it simply identifies the object as the patient
of the action, being required with those bases to produce well-
formed verbs. With some verbs per- is optional; the
corresponding -kan verb has the same meaning. In such
cases both forms are given in the following examples:      Uncertainty as to the meanings of these forms is shown, for
      instance, by the two editions of Tata Bahasa Baku Bahasa
      Indonesia. The first edition (1988. 115) gives memperistrikan
      and mempersuamikan different meanings from memperistri
      and mempersuami respectively. The second edition (1993: 138)
      gives the forms with and without -kan as having the same
      meanings, the suffix simply being optional.
   memperebutkan struggle over
   mempertimbangkan weigh up, consider
   memperhitungkan calculate, estimate
   mempermainkan make fun of
   mempertahankan maintain, defend
   memperjuangkan struggle for
   mempercakapkan talk about
   memperlakukan treat
   mempertunjukkan present, perform
   memperbandingkan/membandingkan compare
   mempersilakan/menyilakan invite (to do something)
   memperdagangkan/mendagangkan deal in, trade in
   mempertontonkan/menontonkan exhibit
1.242 Another group of per-...-kan verbs indicate that the
object is caused to perform the action of the corresponding
intransitive verb. Thus mempersatukan 'unite means 'cause
                                                  1the object to unite (bersatu)'. Other verbs in this group are
better paraphrased 'regard the object as [base], treat the object
as [base]'. With a number of these verbs also per- is optional.
Corresponding intransitive verbs are given in parentheses:
    mempekerjakan employ (bekerja work)
    mempertemukan unite (bertemu meet)
    mempermandikan baptise (mandi bath)
   mempergunakan/menggunakan use (berguna useful)
   mempersiapkan/menyiapkan prepare (bersiap get ready)
    memperbedakan/membedakan distinguish (berbeda be
       different)
   mempersatukan/menyatukan unite (bersatu be united)
1.243 A very small group of per- verbs are based on
simple transitive verbs. These indicate that the subject causes
another person to carry out the action. The one who carries
out the action is expressed in a phrase beginning with
kepada/pada. Thus melihat 'see', memperlihatkan 'cause
(someone) to see; show':
   Harun melihat gambar-gambar saya.
   Harun saw my drawings.
   Saya memperlihatkan gambar-gambar saya kepada
   Harun.
   I showed my drawings to Harun.
A larger group of verbs with this function have only suffix
-kan, as discussed in section 1.200, while with one verb in this
group per- is optional:
   memperdengarkan present (music), let (music) be heard
      (mendengar hear)
   memperkenalkan/mengenalkan introduce (mengenal
      know)
1.244 As examples in sections 1.241-3 show, some per-...-
kan verbs are synonymous with -kan verbs. This is not
always the case; some per-...-kan verbs have no
corresponding -kan forms. In other cases both forms occur
but with different meanings, as with the following:
   mendengarkan listen to : memperdengarkan perform,
      let (object) be heard
   mengerjakan do, perform : mempekerjakan employ
   menunjukkan indicate : mempertunjukkan perform,
      display
   melakukan do, carry out : memperlakukan treat
   memandikan bath : mempermandikan baptise
   mengatakan say : memperkatakan talk about, deliberate
      over
   menanyakan ask about : mempertanyakan question
Transitive verbs with affixation per-...~i
1.245 This affixation occurs with only a limited number of
verbs; it is not productive. Sometimes per- can be deleted, as
indicated in the list below. Two verbs are based on adjectives
and have a causative meaning. The others are based on verbs;
with these per-...-i functions like -i:
   memperbaiki fix, repair
   memperba(ha)rui/memba(ha)rui renew, repair
   mempelajari study
   memperlengkapi/melengkapi equip; complement
   mempersenjatai arm
   memperingati commemorate
   memperlindungi/melindungi protect, shelter
In the case of one verb the per- form contrasts with the non-
per- form: mempelajari 'study', mengajari 'teach, train'.
Secondary verbs
1.246 Among secondary verbal forms there is considerable
variation in function. In most cases primary affixation is
deleted. Secondary verbal forms are base-meN-base form
(such as pukul-memukul), and verbs with affixation ber-...-
an, ber-...-kan, ter-, ke-.».-an and ke-.
Base-meN-base verbs
1.247 This derivation, as in pukul-memukul, occurs only
with certain basic transitive verbs. It consists of the verb base
followed by the active voice form of the verb. There are two
groups of verbs with this structure, one group indicating
reciprocal action and one group indicating 'anything to do
with [base] .
           1Reciprocal base-meN-base verbs
1.248 The verb indicates that two people do the same thing
to each other. Corresponding verbs in English have 'each
other' as object:
   Mereka pukul-memukul.
   They hit each other.
   Kedua keluarga itu selalu tolong-menolong.
   Those two families are always helping each other.
As the above examples show, these verbs occur in intransitive
constructions, the subject expressing both actor and patient of
the corresponding basic verb. They therefore have no passive
transformations.
If a suffix occurs with the basic verb this is usually retained,
although verbs with -kan rarely enter this construction:
    peluk-memeluk embrace each other
   telpon-menelpon telephone each other
   tikam-menikam stab each other
   harga-menghargai respect each other
   cinta-mencintai love each other
   jauh-menjauhi avoid each other
    maaf-memaafkan forgive each other
In a few cases suffix -i of the corresponding basic verb is
deleted:
   surat-menyurat correspond, write to each other
      (menyurati write to)
   kunjung-mengunjung visit each other (mengunjungi visit)
While reciprocal verbs can be based on only a limited number
of basic transitive verbs, forms like telpon-menelpon
'telephone each other' show that there is some degree of
productivity.
1.249 With some verbs the two participants stand not as
actor and patient but as actor and recipient (see 3.17). These
verbs have a complement (see 3.65), corresponding to the
object of the related basic verb. The reciprocal participants
can both be expressed by the subject. Sometimes one
participant can alternatively be expressed by a prepositional
phrase beginning with dengan 'with':
   Yanti dan Lia tukar-menukar hadiah Natal.
   Yanti and Lia exchanged Christmas presents.
   Yanti tukar-menukar hadiah Natal dengan Lia.
   Yanti exchanges Christmas presents with Lia.
Other verbs in this group are:
   tawar-menawar bargain (with someone)
   pinjam-meminjam borrow (from each other)
1.250 The only verb in this group which does not have a
corresponding basic transitive form is bahu-membahu 'work
shoulder-to-shoulder':
   Dia bahu-membahu dengan rekannya.
   He worked shoulder-to-shoulder with his colleagues.
1.251 For the majority of basic verbs no reciprocal form
occurs. With these reciprocity can be indicated by saling (see
2.160), which can also occur instead of a reciprocal form:
   Mereka kunjung-mengunjung.
   Mereka saling mengunjungi.
   They visit each other.
The two forms are sometimes redundantly combined:
  Mereka saling kunjung-mengunjung.
  They visit each other.
Other reciprocal verbs have affixation ber- (see 1.173) or
ber-...-an (see 1.255).
Verbs meaning 'everything to do with'
1.252 Based on basic transitive verbs which do not refer to
activities which can normally be reciprocal, because the object
is not typically a person, this form means 'everything/anything
to do with [base], affairs relating to [base]'. Thus jahit-
menjahit 'anything to do with sewing' (menjahit 'sew ),      1a n g k a t - m e n g a n g k a t 'anything to do with lifting'
(mengangkat 'lift'), masak-memasak 'everything to do with
cooking, the art of cooking' (memasak 'cook'):
   Kalau soal jahit-menjahit, jangan berikan kepada sayar
   If it's anything to do with sewing don't give it to me.
   Urusan angkat-mengangkat serahkan kepada kami.
   Any lifting there is to do leave to us.
   Dia banyak tahu tentang masak-memasak.
   She knows a great deal about the art of cooking.   12
This function is quite productive; other forms include:
   tari-menari anything to do with dancing
   karang-mengarang anything to do with writing
  sulam-menyulam anything to do with embroidery
  lukis-melukis anything to do with painting
   ketik-mengetik anything to do with typing
These forms are based only on basic simple transitive verbs.
As in the above examples, the form is always nominalised (see
3.130), occurring either as the head of a noun phrase or
modifying another noun.
1.253 A unique form is tidak tahu-menahu 'know
absolutely nothing about'. This is not nominalised, occurring
as the predicate of a verbal clause, and containing the form
menahu, which does not otherwise occur:
   Yudi tak tahu-menahu pembunuhan gadis itu.
   Yudi knows absolutely nothing about the murder of that
   girl.","[127, 128, 129, 130, 131, 132, 133, 134]"
"Verbal clauses
3.16 Verbal clauses have a verb as their predicate centre.
Verbal clauses display greater variety and complexity than
non-verbal constructions; special consideration is required for
transitivity (see 3.18-25), voice (see 3.26-40) and word order
(3.41-9). The verb ada has some unique characteristics and
is discussed separately in sections 3.54-60.
Further, a consideration of grammatical roles and semantic
roles is important for an understanding of verbal clauses.
This topic is mentioned in section 3.17.
Participant roles
3.17 Components of the clause such as subject and object
refer to grammatical relationships. However, the semantic
relationship between these elements and the predicate can
vary. For instance, in the clause Ali memukul John 'Ali hits
John', the subject Ali refers to the participant who carries out
the action. In the clause Ali dipukul John 'Ali is hit by John ,
                                                              1the subject identifies the participant to which something is
done, the patient.
The major participants, or semantic roles, are:
Actor : The one who carries out the action. The actor is
  expressed by the subject in an active clause, such as Ali in
  Ali menolong saya 'Ali helps me'. It occurs as agent in a
  passive clause, which is optionally marked by oleh 'by' (see
  3.27): Saya ditolong (oleh) Ali 'I am helped by Ali'.
Patient : The patient, also called the goal, is the participant
   which is moved or affected by the action. It occurs as
   object in most active clauses, such as Ali in Mereka
   menolong Ali 'They help Ali'. It occurs as subject in the
   passive of such constructions: Ali ditolong oleh mereka
   'Ali is helped by them'. With ditransitive verbs the patient
   can occur as the secondary object (see 3.20). Thus, the
   patient uang 'money' occurs as secondary object in Saya
   memberi dia uang 'I give him money'.
Recipient : This is the person at whom the action is directed.
  It can follow prepositions kepada and pada 'to'. With
  some verbs, especially -i verbs (see 1.212), it can occur as
  object, such as dia 'he' in Saya memberi dia uang 'I give
  him money'. In passives of such constructions it occurs as
  subject: Dia diberi uang 'He is given money'.
Location : This is the place where the action occurs or the
  place from which or to which the action is directed. It is
  normally marked by a prepositional phrase. However, it
  can be the object with -i verbs and some simple transitive
  verbs, such as kebun 'garden' in Mereka menanami kebun
- 'They plant the garden'. In passives of such constructions
  it occurs as subject: Kebun ditanami The garden is
  planted'.
Beneficiary : This is the person for whose benefit an action
  is performed. It is usually marked by preposition untuk
  'for'. With benefactive -kan verbs (see 1.206) it occurs as
  object, such as Ali in Saya membelikan Ali buku 'I buy
   Ali a book'. In passives of such constructions it occurs as
   subject: Ali dibelikan buku 'Ali is bought a book'.
Instrument : This is the thing with which the action is
   performed. It is usually marked by preposition dengan
   'with', such as tali 'rope' in Dia mengikat anjing dengan
   tali 'He tied up the dog with a rope'. This participant can
   sometimes occur as object, that is with 'instrumental' -kan
   (see 1.205). However, it is probably best to recognise a
   reinterpretation of the role of the participant in this case.
   That is, in the construction Dia mengikatkan tali ke anjing
   'He tied the rope to the dog', tali is best considered as
   having the role of patient.","[267, 268, 269]"
"Relative clauses
3.97 One way of adding information about a noun is by
incorporating a clause within the noun phrase. This clause is
preceded by yang and is called a relative clause. The head of
the noun phrase corresponds to some component within the
relative clause. The noun phrase within which the relative
clause occurs, or is embedded, is called the embedding
phrase.
There are a number of different types of relative clause. The
most common of these is the defining relative clause,
described in sections 3.98-102 and usually referred to simply
as a relative clause. Other relative clauses are topic-comment
relative clauses, described in sections 3.103-5, and
prepositional relative clauses, described in section 3.106. A
fourth type of relative clause is not preceded by yang. This is
the locative relative clause, discussed in section 3.107.
Defining relative clauses
3.98 A defining relative clause is one whose subject
corresponds to the head noun of the embedding phrase. In
the following sections a defining relative clause is referred to
just as a relative clause, being by far the most common type
of relative clause. The clause is incorporated, or embedded,
within the noun phrase by: (i) deleting its subject, which is
identical to the head noun of the embedding phrase, and (ii)
placing yang before it. Thus, the following independent
clause: (a) Orang itu duduk dekat jendela That person is
sitting near the window', can be embedded within the subject
noun phrase of the following clause: (b) Orang itu bekerja
dengan saya That person works with me', by the two steps
above, giving: (c) Orang yang duduk dekat jendela itu
bekerja dengan saya 'The person who is sitting near the
window works with me'.
The italicised part in (c) is the relative clause; it derives from
(a) by the steps (i) and (ii) above and occurs within the
subject of (c). The subject of (c) ends with optional itu.
Although itu identifies the subject of (b), this is also achieved
by the relative clause; in this case itu is more likely to be
omitted from the embedding phrase. In journalistic style a
long relative clause is sometimes placed after a demonstrative.
This is discussed in section 2.60.
In Indonesian yang must occur before a relative clause,
although in English corresponding 'who' or 'which' can
sometimes be omitted:
   Mobil yang ditubruk truk itu rusak sama sekali.
   The car (which was) hit by the truck is a complete wreck.
   Orang yang berkumpul di depan pintu harus pindah.
   The people (who are) gathering in front of the door will
   have to move.
   Celana yang dibelinya kemarin terlalu kecil.
   The trousers (which) he bought yesterday are too small.
3.99 A relative clause can contain any constituent
occurring in an independent clause except the subject, which
is identical to the head of the embedding noun phrase. Since
the head noun stands in the same relationship to the verb as
the subject of the clause that relationship must be shown by
the verb. If the relationship is that of actor the verb must be
active:
    orang yang membangun rumah saya
    the person who built my house
If the noun stands as object the verb must be passive:
    tanah yang sudah digarap
   land which has been worked
The rule that the verb must be passive following a noun which
stands as object to it can cause difficulty for English speakers
as in English the verb can be, and usually is, active in this
context:
   Rumah yang dibangun Pak Dani tidak begitu besar.
   The house Mr Dani built isn't very big.
   Bis yang saya naiki tidak berhenti di Jalan Pramuka.
   The bus I got didn't stop at Pramuka Road.
   Dokter yang kami telpon segera datang.
   The doctor who we called quickly came.
3.100 Verbal suffixes remain unchanged in relative
clauses. Thus the head noun can have any participant role
that the subject of an independent passive clause has. In the
first example below the head noun stands as recipient and in
the second it stands as beneficiary:
    Beberapa orang yang dikirimi surat belum menjawab.
    Several of the people who were sent letters have not yet
    replied.
    Pemuda yang dicarikan pekerjaan sangat berterima
    kasih.
    The youth for whom work was sought was very thankful.
3.101 Sections 3.98-100 refer only to verbal relative
clauses. Relative clauses can also derive from other basic
clause types. The following are some examples of noun
phrases containing non-verbal relative clauses. The first is an
adjective relative clause (further discussed in 2.45), followed
by prepositional relative clauses:
   mobil yang biru
   the blue car
   orang yang di sini tadi
   the person who was here a while ago
   anak yang seperti Tini
   children who are like Tini
Noun relative clauses rarely occur. Normally yang cannot
precede a noun. However, a noun relative clause can be used
when the speaker wishes to distinguish a person from other
people with similar characteristics, especially the same name:
   Soeharto yang presiden
   Soeharto who is president (not some other Soeharto)
Moreover, there is a growing tendency, especially in
journalistic style, to allow noun relative clauses to add
information about the head noun, rather than to identify,
although this is not acceptable to all speakers:
    Pemerintah mengizinkan Zardari, yang juga anggota
   parlemen, untuk menghadiri sidang.
   The government allowed Zadari, who is also a member of
   parliament, to attend the session.
    Ibu Alieva, yang seorang ibu, akan kami jemput.
   Mrs Alieva, who is a woman, will be met by us.
3.102 A number of relative clauses can occur within the
one noun phrase. The following example contains adjective
and verbal relative clauses:
   pertambangan-pertambangan yang penting yang
   menghasilkan bahan tambang strategis
   important mines which produce strategic minerals
Topic-comment relative clauses
3.103 Both possessor topic-comment clauses (see 3.88)
and object topic-comment clauses (see 3.91) can be
embedded in noun phrases. The topic of the topic-comment
clause is deleted; the noun of the embedding phrase then
stands as topic (not subject) to the relative clause. The -nya in
the relative clause identifies the head of the noun phrase.
Possessor topic-comment relative clauses meaning
'whose'
3.104 In possessor topic-comment relative clauses, which
translate constructions with 'whose' in English, the subject of
the relative clause is the thing possessed by the head noun.
The first example below derives from the independent clause
Sopir itu namanya Ali 'That driver's name is Ali':
   sopir yang namanya Ali
   the driver whose name is Ali
   orang yang mobilnya dicuri
   the person whose car was stolen
   jalan yang panjangnya sekitar 18 kilometer
   a road whose length is about 18 kilometers
If the subject of a topic-comment clause is something
inalienably possessed by the topic it can occur after the
predicate, as discussed in section 3.89. This rule also applies
in relative topic-comment clauses:
   lima puluh empat negara Afrika yang diakui
   kedaulatannya
   fifty four African nations whose sovereignty is recognised
   kawasan yang dipuji kebersihannya ini
   this region whose cleanliness has been praised
   seorang pejabat yang tidak akan disebutkan namanya
   an official whose name will not be mentioned
   gadis yang kami kagumi kecantikan dan kelembutannya
   itu
   the girl whose beauty and gentleness we admired
Object topic-comment relative clauses
3.105 The head of the embedding phrase is identical to the
object of the relative clause and is marked by -nya occurring
in object position within the clause. In the first example
below the head of the embedding phrase harapan 'hope is      1also object of the verb menyelesaikan 'fulfil':
   Saya banyak menciptakan harapan bagi rakyat yang
   saya sendiri tidak mampu menyelesaikannya.
   I created many hopes for the people which I myself was
   not able to fulfil.
   senjata yang tidak setiap musuh bisa menghadapinya
   weapons which not every enemy can face
   sebuah lagu yang barangkali saudara akan
   menyukainya
   a song which perhaps you will like
Prepositional relative clauses
3.106 In these constructions the head of the embedding
phrase is not identical to the subject (or topic) of the relative
clause. Instead it is identical to the noun in a prepositional
phrase (see 2.118), usually one indicating location. The noun
following the preposition is deleted and replaced by -nya.
The following basic clause contains a prepositional phrase as
an adjunct of location (see 2.208):
   Di belakang rumah itu ada pohon mangga.
   Behind that house there is a mango tree.
This can be embedded in a noun phrase whose head is rumah
'house'. Rumah itu is deleted from the prepositional phrase
and its place taken by -nya:
   rumah yang di belakangnya ada pohon mangga
   the house behind which there is a mango tree
The preposition may be followed by a longer noun phrase;
the whole of this is deleted from the relative clause as it also
occurs in the embedding phrase. The locative adjunct in the
following construction contains the phrase sebuah grup
vokal 'a vocal group':
   Rima juga ikut di dalam sebuah grup vokal.
   Rima also participates in a vocal group.
The whole phrase is deleted from the relative clause and
replaced by -nya:
   sebuah grup vokal yang di dalamnya Rima juga ikut
   a vocal group in which Rima also participates
In such constructions the preposition occurs at the beginning
of the relative clause, immediately after yang. The
preposition involved is usually a locative preposition, as in the
examples above and the first example below. In the other
examples below it is the recipient preposition kepada 'to' and
the benefactive preposition untuk 'for':
    meja yang di atasnya tersedia makanan
    the table on which food is set
    orang yang kepadariya saya mengirimkan surat
  ' the person I sent a letter to
    anak yang untuknya saya membeli kado
    the child I bought the present for
Prepositional relative clauses occur infrequently and are likely
to be replaced by defining relative clauses where these can
occur. Thus the last two examples above could alternatively
be expressed:
   orang yang saya kirimi surat
   the person I sent a letter to
   anak yang saya belikan kado
   the child I bought the present for
Locative relative clauses
3.107 These differ from other relative clauses in that they
are not preceded by yang. The more traditional construction
begins with tempat, translated 'where : 1   Pabrik tempat mereka bekerja tidak jauh dari sini.
   The factory where they work is not far from here.
Although some people still regard this as the only acceptable
form it is more commonly replaced by di mana in the
present-day language:
   pabrik di mana mereka bekerja
   the factory where they work
On analogy with this form constructions with dari mana
'from where, from which' and dalam mana 'in which' are
becoming more common in journalistic style, although
unacceptable to many people:
    pangkalan dari mana roket itu dilepaskan
    the base from which the rocket was launched
    surat-surat cinta dalam mana dia berjanji akan
   mengawini gadis-gadis itu
    love letters in which he promised to marry those girlsBahwa clauses
3.108 Any statement can follow bahwa 'that'; these
correspond to 'that' clauses in English. A bahwa clause
behaves like a noun phrase and can occur in a number of
positions where nouns usually occur.
3.109 A bahwa clause can occur within a noun phrase,
modifying the head noun (see also 2.54):
   Kabar bahwa gaji pegawai akan naik menggembirakan
   kami.
   The news that employee's wages would rise delighted us.
   Tudingan bahwa Bung Karno terlibat makin santer.
   Accusations that Bung Karno was involved became more
   and more frequent.
3.110 It can also occur as the predicate of a noun clause.
A copula usually precedes bahwa (an example is given in
3.6).
3.111 The most frequent occurrence of a bahwa clause is
as object of a transitive verb or as complement of an
intransitive verb (see 3.66). As such it introduces indirect
speech, also called an indirect quote, which can be used
instead of direct speech (see 3.95):
   Dia menjawab, ""Saya tidak percaya"".
   He replied, ""I don't believe it"".
   Dia menjawab bahwa dia tidak percaya.
   He replied that he didn't believe it.
B a h w a clauses most frequently occur as objects or
complements of verbs which report something that happened
or report what someone said; only the latter group can replace
the bahwa clause by a direct quote. These are usually called
reporting verbs in grammars of English and many of them
rarely, if ever, have a noun as an object:
   Dia sadar bahwa dia telah ditipu.
   He was aware that he had been tricked.
   Kami percaya bahwa kami dapat mengatasi kesukaran
   ini.
   We believe that we can overcome this difficulty.
   Kami mengakui bahwa kami perlu bantuan dari luar
   negeri.
   We acknowledge that we need help from overseas.
A list of intransitive verbs which can have a bahwa clause as
complement is given in section 3.66.
When a bahwa clause is object or complement bahwa can be
omitted:
  Saya tahu (bahwa) dia pencuri.
  I know (that) he is a thief.
  Dia memperkirakan (bahwa) Indonesia membutuhkan
  tiga ribu pilot baru.
   He estimates (that) Indonesia needs three thousand new
   pilots.
If the subject of the bahwa clause is the same as the subject of
the main clause then it can be omitted along with bahwa:
    Mereka berjanji bahwa mereka tidak akan merongrong
    pemerintah.
    They promised that they would not undermine the
    government.
    Mereka berjanji tidak akan merongrong pemerintah.
    They promised not to undermine the government.
    Dia mengancam bahwa dia akan membunuh saya.
    He threatened that he would kill me.
    Dia mengancam akan membunuh saya.
    He threatened to kill me.
3.112 A bahwa clause can occur in subject position. As
subject it usually follows the predicate. Corresponding to
such clauses in English are constructions whose subject is
impersonal 'it , with the that' clause following the predicate.
              1           1In some grammars of English such structures are treated as
having two subjects; 'it' is called the 'anticipatory subject' and
the 'that' clause is called the 'postponed subject'. In formal
English the 'that' clause may precede the verb as the sole
subject, as given as an alternative translation to the first
example below. The bahwa clause may also precede the
predicate, although this is not common:
   Bukanlah rahasia lagi bahwa dia suka pada Irma.
   It is no longer a secret that he likes Irma. (That he likes
   Irma is no longer a secret.)
   Jelas bahwa dia ingin menipu kita.
   It is clear that he wants to cheat us.
   Belum disadari bahwa helm dapat mencegah luka berat.
   It isn't yet realised that a helmet can prevent serious injury.
   Bahwa kabar itu tidak benar diumumkan oleh yang
   berwajib.
   That the news was not true was announced by the
   authorities.
If the bahwa clause is in subject position and follows the
predicate bahwa can be deleted; if it precedes the predicate
bahwa cannot be deleted:
    Tidak dapat disangkal (bahwa) film mempunyai
    pengaruh besar.
    It cannot be denied that movies have a big influence.
    Bahwa film mempunyai pengaruh besar tidak dapat
    disangkal.
    That movies have a big influence cannot be denied.","[313, 314, 315, 316, 317, 318, 319, 320, 321, 322]"
"Questions with -kah
4.23 A sentence can be overtly marked as a question by
use of -kah. It is always optional and is largely confined to
writing and formal speech. The element to which -kah is
attached is placed first in the question. -Kah can occur in
both yes-no and specific questions.
-kah in yes-no questions
4.24 If apa is present -kah attaches to it:
   Apakah dia sakit?
   Is he sick?
If apa does not occur -kah attaches to another word within
the clause. This is usually the predicate centre:
   Sakitkah dia?
   Is he sick?
   Jatuhkah dia?
   Did she fall?
If the predicate centre is a phrase, for instance an adjective or
locative phrase, or if the predicate phrase contains time
marker, modal or negative, -kah can attach to the final word
of the phrase, the whole phrase then occurring at the
beginning of the question:
   Terlalu gemukkah anda?
   Are you too fat?
   Sudah pergikah ia?
   Has she gone?
If a complement occurs this remains in its normal position:
    Maukah kamu ikut?
    Do you want to come along?
    Tahukah anda mengapa mereka bekerja di sini?
    Do you know why they are working here?
Instead of being attached to the predicate centre -kah can be
attached to a time marker, negative or modal to highlight that
this is what is being asked about. If marked by -kah this
word then goes to the beginning of the clause while the rest of
the predicate remains in its usual place. Some other clause
components, including a number of adjuncts, can also be
marked in this way:
    Sudahkah hal itu kaupikirkan?
    Have you already thought about that matter?
    Akankah pertemuannya dengan Presiden Soeharto
    batal?
    Will his meeting with President Soeharto be cancelled?
    Seringkah dia pergi ke sana?
    Does she often go there?
4.25 The sentence tag bukan (see 4.9) can take -kah; it
then goes to the beginning of the sentence and carries a tone
of Isn't it the case that...?':
   Bukankah dia berasal dari golongan menengah?
   Isn't it the case that he comes from the middle class?
   Bukankah saudara kaya?
   Aren't you rich? (Isn't it the case that you are rich?)
If bukankah occurs in a noun clause it can alternatively be
interpreted as a case of -kah being attached to the negative
within the predicate and not to a tag. This is the only
interpretation if the negative is other than bukan:
   Tidakkah ini memberikan dampak yang negatif?
   Doesn't this give a negative impact?
Specific questions with -kah
4.26 In specific questions -kah attaches to the question
word, which comes first in the clause:
   Siapakah dia?
   Who is he?
   Bagaimanakah perahu nelayan itu dapat menemukan
   jalan?
   How can the fishermen's boats find their way?
   Apakah yang dia kerjakan?
   What is he doing?
If the question word is part of a phrase the whole phrase
occurs first, with -kah attached to the last word of the phrase:
   Pukul berapakah pasawat berangkat?
   What time does the plane depart?
   Berapa buahkah kamar hotel itu?
   How many rooms are there in that hotel? (literally: How
   many are the rooms of that hotel?)
If siapa 'who' and apa 'what' occur as object of an active verb
they must come after the verb, in which case -kah cannot
occur. However, the question word can occur first in an
identifying clause (see 3.92) and take -kah:
    Anda menemui siapa?
    Who did you meet?
    Siapakah yang anda temui?
    Who did you meet? (literally: Who was the one you met?)Indirect questions
4.27 A question can be placed within a statement, taking
the place of a noun. Thus the question Kapan dia akan
pindah? 'When will he move?' can occur as the complement
of tahu 'know':
    Saya tidak tahu kapan dia akan pindah.
    I don't know when he will move.
As it takes the place of a noun an indirect question is a kind
of nominalised clause (see 3.130). Turning a free question
into an indirect question involves no change in word order in
Indonesian. However, interrogative intonation does not occur
and a question mark is not used in writing.
4.28 Indirect specific questions can occur as object or
complement of a verb:
   Saya tidak tahu mengapa rapat itu dibatalkan.
   I don't know why the meeting was cancelled.
   Saya lupa di mana saya menyimpan surat itu.
   I forget where I put the letter.
   Kami mengerti bagaimana perasaannya.
   We understand his feelings, (lit: ...what his feelings are
   like)
   Dia memberitahukan apa yang dilihatnya.
   He told what he saw.
4.29 The indirect question can be the subject in a passive
clause; it usually follows the verb:
   Belum diketahui siapa yang akan menjadi dekan.
   It isn't known yet who will become the dean.
4.30 An indirect yes-no question must be preceded by
apa(kah), translated 'if, whether'; as the question loses its
interrogative intonation there is no other signal that it is a
question. Like indirect specific questions these can occur as
object or complement or as subject in a passive clause:
   Kami ragu-ragu apa dia bisa lulus ujian.
   We are doubtful whether he can pass the exam.
   Saya tidak tahu apakah bis ini berhenti di Pasar Senen.
   I don't know if this bus stops at Pasar Senen.
   Masih diragukan apakah pendapat ini dapat diterima.
   It is still doubtful whether this opinion can be accepted.
4.31 Yes-no questions ending with atau plus a negative
(see 4.12) can also become indirect questions:
   Dia bertanya apa mereka setuju atau tidak.
   He asked if they agreed or not.
   Saya tidak tahu apakah ini Pak Amran atau bukan.
   I don't know if this is Mr Amran or not.
Imperatives
4.32 Constructions in Imperative mood are all addressed
to someone with the intention that something is done. They
range from strong commands to requests, appeals and
suggestions. Basic imperatives are discussed in sections 4.33-
40. In sections 4.41-56 are discussed milder constructions,
including requests and invitations.
Basic imperatives are usually written with a final exclamation
mark, although this convention is not always observed,
especially if the order is a mild one.
Intransitive verbs in imperatives
4.33 Intransitive verbs undergo no change in imperatives:
   Datang ke sini!
   Come here!
   Berangkat sekarang!
   Leave now!
   Menginap di sini!
   Stay here!
Transitive verbs in imperatives
4.34 Transitive verbs drop prefix meN- if they refer to
action performed on a specific object:
   Lihat foto ini!
   Look at this photo!
   Tutup pintu!
   Shut the door!
A transitive verb in an imperative construction does not lose
its prefix if it occurs without an object, that is, if acting
pseudo-intransitively (see 3.21):
    Membaca sekarang!
    Read now!
    Menulis baik-baik!
    Write properly!
Prefix meN- is also retained if an object occurs but does not
refer to something specific:
   Menabung uang untuk hari tuamu!
   Save money for your old age!
   Membaca buku sekarang!
   Read a book now!
Such constructions refer to action in general, not to a
particular action performed on a specific object. Interest is
thus on the activity alone and the 'object can be regarded as
                                                1forming a kind of compound with the verb. Thus, in the last
example above, membaca buku acts like an intransitive verb
'do book reading'.
Negative imperatives
4.35 Negative commands are formed with jangan 'don't':
   Jangan merokok di sini!
   Don't smoke here!
   Jangan tidur!
   Don't go to sleep!
In the presence of jangan prefix meN- on transitive verbs is
regarded by most people as optional, even if there is a specific
object:
   Jangan (mem)baca buku itu sekarang!
   Don't read that book now!
Use of meN- in such cases reduces the force of the command,
resulting in a milder imperative. Prefix meN- is retained
                                       2with pseudo-intransitives, as is also the case in positive
imperatives (see 4.34). The first example below refers to
action on a specific object (which is ellipted because it has
already been mentioned - see 4.111), while in the second
interest is solely on the action:  3   Pakaian ini tidak kotor. Jangan cuci!
   These clothes aren't dirty. Don't wash them!","[348, 349, 350, 351, 352, 353]"
"Word order in clauses
3.41 The normal or standard order of constituents in a
clause is subject + predicate. In a transitive verbal clause the
normal order is subject + predicate + object. If there are two
objects (see 3.20) the normal order is subject + verb +
primary object + secondary object. In a passive clause the
normal order is subject + verb + agent. If there is a secondary
object this freely precedes or follows the agent. In passive
type two (see 3.28) the order is subject + agent + verb.
While some adjuncts tend to occur in a particular position
within the clause, such as before the subject or after the
predicate, they are much freer to move than nuclear
components and it is not unusual for them to appear in a
variety of positions. An adjunct which usually occurs in one
position does not receive any emphasis when in that position.
If shifted elsewhere attention is drawn to it. Thus the adverb
dengan cepat 'fast' occurs in its usual position after the verb
in the first clause below, where it receives no emphasis. In the
second clause it is placed before the subject, where it receives
emphasis:
    Michael lari ke toko dengan cepat.
    Michael ran to the shop quickly.
    Dengan cepat Michael lari ke toko.
    Quickly Michael ran to the shop.
Nuclear clause components usually have a fixed position in
relation to other nuclear components. When they are moved
from this position attention is focused on them.
Changes from normal word order, or inversion, of nuclear
clause components is discussed in the following sections. A
few cases of word order change are also mentioned elsewhere
when it is necessary in the description of a particular
construction.
Placing the predicate before the subject
3.42 The predicate can occur before the subject in a non-
verbal clause, such as in a noun clause or adjective clause. In
this case the predicate receives highlighting:
    Mahasiswa Unpad dia*
    She is an Unpad (University of Padjadjaran) student.
   O! Sombong kau, Ki Demang.
   Oh! you are arrogant, Ki Demang.
   Cantik sekali gadis itu.
   That girl is very pretty.
3.43 An intransitive verb can also occur before the
subject. When shifted to pre-subject position a verb freqently
takes foregrounding particle -lah (see 3.51):
   Lalu datanglah seorang musyafir.
   Then there came a traveller.
   Di sini hati saya hancur. Menangislah saya dengan
   sangat sedih.
   Here my heart broke. I cried very sadly.
The emphasis given to the verb when it is placed before the
subject is to some extent caught by the translation of the first
example above: Datanglah seorang musyafir There came a
traveller , although this device is not always possible in
        1English.
3.44 A transitive verb, whether active or passive, can also
occur before the subject. A passive verb frequently precedes
its subject to take foregrounding, often with -lah (see 3.51).
Very frequently in such constructions the verb is preceded by
an adjunct, which gives a kind of balance to the construction,
the verb still occurring in the 'middle' of the clause. Similar
constructions occur in English:
   Di atas gunung telah didirikan sebuah antene raksasa.
   On top of the mountain has been built a giant antenna.
   Pada hari itu terciptalah suatu negara Indonesia
   merdeka.
   On that day there was created a free Indonesia.
Such balancing is not, however, obligatory:
   Sudah dibuatkan sepatu khusus bagi dia.
   Special shoes have been made for him.
3.45 Frequently a long subject is placed after the verb. In
the following example the subject is the noun phrase
beginning with alat-alat and continuing to the end of the
sentence:
   Sekarang di toko Tuan Ong tersedia alat-alat yang
   menarik perhatian orang desa yang berkunjung ke kota.
   Now in Mr Ong's store are available implements which
   attract the attention of villagers visiting the town.
In such cases the verb is not placed before the subject for
highlighting, but rather the subject is placed last to avoid a
stylistically clumsy construction.
When the subject is a bahwa clause (see 3.112), an untuk
clause (see 3.115), a supaya/agar clause (see 3.127), a
nominal clause (see 3.143), or an indirect question (see 4.29),
it usually follows the predicate. Such subjects are frequently
long. The placing of such subjects after the predicate occurs
also in non-verbal clauses, as in the last example below. The
occurrence of 'it' at the beginning of corresponding
constructions in English is discussed in section 3.112:
    Diputuskan bahwa saya harus dibuang.
    It was decided that I must be driven out.
    Sulit untuk menurunkan harga.
    It is difficult to lower prices.
    Diserukan agar dilancarkan aksi-aksi protes
    internasional di semua pusat operasi perusahaan itu.
    It was urged that international protest actions be launched
    in all centres of operation of the company.
   Mulai tahun 1970 diwajibkan mengenakan tali
   pengaman.
   Beginning in 1970 the wearing of seat belts became
   compulsory.
   Masih diragukan apakah keputusan ini dapat diterima.
   It is still doubted whether this decision can be accepted.
   Bukan maksud saya menggurui ayah.
   It's not my intention to lecture father.
3.46 In general, the longer a subject the more likely it is
to follow the predicate. Nevertheless, a long subject may
retain its usual position before the verb. In the following
example the subject, jemaat Katolik Jawa yang pertama 'the
first Javanese Catholic congregation', occurs before the verb:
    Di mata air Sendangsono pada tanggal tiga puluh
    Desember 1904 jemaat Katolik Jawa yang pertama
    dipermandikan.
    In the Sendangsono spring on the thirtieth of December
    1904 the first Javanese Catholic congregation was baptised.
The position of the agent in a passive clause
3.47 The agent of a passive normally comes immediately
after the verb. However, it can be preceded by several clause
elements, in which case oleh is obligatory.
A secondary object can occur before or after the agent:
  Kami diserahi kepala kantor tugas itu.
   Kami diserahi tugas itu oleh kepala kantor.
  We were handed that task by the office head.
A number of adjuncts, such as the adjunct of location in the
following example, can also precede the agent:
   Kami dibawa ke bioskop oleh ayah.
   We were taken to the movies by father.
If the speaker wants to treat the agent of a passive verb as
important information it can go before the verb. Since it is
out of its standard position the agent phrase must be preceded
by oleh (see 3.27). It can precede or follow the subject:
    Oleh seorang bekas penderita kusta Pak Hena disuruh
    ke rumah sakit lepra.
   By a former leprosy sufferer Mr Hena was told to go to the
   leprosy hospital.
   Oleh orang tuanya ia diberi pembantu.
   By his parents he was given an assistant.
   Musikus itu oleh pengadilan Selandia Baru divonis tujuh
   tahun penjara.
   The musician was sentenced to seven years jail by the New
   Zealand court.
Position of the object
3.48 The object of an active verb cannot occur before the
verb. Occurrence of the patient participant (see 3.17) before
the verb requires it to be the subject of a passive verb. This
rule also applies in derived constructions, as discussed in
sections 3.85, 3.91 and 3.99.
If the object of a verb is long it is usually placed last in the
clause, following other clause components such as adjuncts
and secondary object. In the following example the object,
the phrase beginning with rekannya 'his colleague , follows
                                                     1the instrument:
   Andre Agassi mengipasi dengan handuk rekannya John
    McEnroe, yang kepanasan.
    Andre Agassi fanned with a towel his colleague John
   McEnroe, who was overcome by the heat.
If the object is a nominalised construction, such as a bahwa
clause, a clause beginning with untuk or supaya, or an
indirect question beginning with apakah (see 4.30), it is also
placed last in the clause. In the following examples the object
follows a locative phrase beginning with kepada 'to':
    Pemerintah mengumumkan kepada petani bahwa harga
    beras akan naik.
  ' The government announced to the farmers that the price
    of rice would rise.
    Dia menyarankan kepada Tuti supaya berolah raga.
    He advised Tuti to play sport.
    Kita akan menanyakan kepada masyarakat apakah
    mereka akan menerima kita kembali.
    We will ask the community if they will accept us back.
Several changes occurring together
3.49 Changes in word order to focus attention on a
particular component of a clause and to avoid a stilted
construction may occur together. In the following passive
construction the agent is fronted for highlighting while the
subject, being exceptionally long, is placed after the verb:
   Selain itu, oleh desa dikembangkan pula usaha di bidang
   industri rumah, seperti pertenunan.
   Apart from that, by the village have been developed also
   endeavours in the area of home industries, such as
   weaving.
Foregrounding particles
3.50 Two particles are recognised here as foregrounding
particles, -lah and -kah. The latter occurs only in questions
and is discussed in sections 4.23-6. Particle pun is usually
grouped with -lah in discussions of Indonesian grammar.
Here it is grouped with the focusing adjuncts (see 2.22Iff).
Particle -lah
3.51 Although referred to as a particle, -lah is always
written attached to the preceding word. Particle -lah has been
called, among other things, a 'predicative marker' and a
'foreground marker'. Its most common function is to mark
the predicate when the predicate is out of its normal position,
usually when it is placed before the subject. Since the
predicate is strongly foregrounded or highlighted in this
position, -lah is associated with that foregrounding, as in the
following examples (other examples occur in section 3.43):
    Kira-kira tahun 1400 masuklah pengaruh Islam di
   Indonesia.
   About the year 1400 the influence of Islam entered
   Indonesia.
   Sesudah mengucapkan kata-kata itu, bangkitlah dia dari
   kursi dan terus pergi tanpa mengucapkan kata-kata
   pamit.
   After uttering those words he got up from his chair and
   straightaway went, without taking leave.
   Tertipulah kamu!
   You were tricked!
   Makin yakinlah aku akan kebenaran firman Tuhan.
   I am increasingly convinced of the truth of God's
   commandments.
Particle -lah attaches to the first word of the predicate, which
may be a negative, temporal marker or modal:
   Dapatlah disimpulkan bahwa serangan itu direncanakan
   lama sebelumnya.
   It can be concluded that the attack was planned well in
   advance.
   Tidaklah pantas kalau pemburuan kanguru masih tetap
   diizinkan.
   It is not appropriate if kangaroo hunting is permitted to
   continue.
Particle -lah can also attach to negatives to give emphasis (or
foregrounding), even if the predicate is in its normal position:
   Hubungan antara kedua petinggi itu saat ini tidaklah
   terlalu baik.
   Relations between the two important figures at the moment
   are not too good.
   Hutan lindung Kapuk bukanlah hutan lindung pertama
   yang berubah fungsi.
   The Kapuk protected forest is not the first protected forest
   to undergo a change of function.
It sometimes also occurs with other words, such as modifying
adverbs, to emphasise them without the predicate being
fronted:
    Hubungan Indonesia dan Amerika sangatlah dekat.
    Relations between Indonesia and America are very close.
-Lah is never obligatory; it is particularly common in certain
constructions where the predicate typically precedes the
subject, such as identifying clauses (see 3.92) and certain
imperatives (see 4.40), and is discussed separately for such
constructions.
3.52 A predicate marked by -lah does not occur before
the subject if this is marked for emphasis by pun (see
2.22 Iff):
   Dan penonton menyambut dengan tepuk tangan yang
   meriah. Kemudian layar pun tutuplah.
   And the audience applauded (our performance) with
   cheerful clapping. Afterwards the curtain closed.
   Anak-anak mulai bubar. Dan yang tinggal di ruang
   kelas enam, tempat kami disunati, hanyalah orang tua-
   tua. Mereka pun pulanglah seorang demi seorang ...
   The children dispersed. And only the elders remained in
   class room six, where we were circumsized. Then they too
   went home one by one ...
3.53 Besides occurring within the predicate -lah can be
attached to a clause adjunct to foreground it. The adjunct
always occurs first in the clause with -lah attached to its last
word. Such constructions are usually translated by cleft
sentences (see 3.92) in English:
   Sejak tahun itulah Indonesia secara resmi menjadi
   jajahan Belanda.
   It was from that year that Indonesia officially became a
   Dutch colony.
   Beginilah terungkapkan cinta dan kesetiaan terhadap
   para leluhur.
   In this way can be expressed love and faithfulness towards
   the ancestors.
   Di desalah terdapat masa depan bangsa kita.
   It is in the villages that the future of our people is found.","[284, 285, 286, 287, 288, 289, 290, 291]"
"      These two exampies are taken from Slametmuijana (1969: 382).
  Feeling depressed and not knowing what he should do, the
  president then asked...
2 . 2 2 4 While emphasising the preceding word or phrase
p u n can also indicate an addition, similar to juga and pula
'also (see 2.219), which may accompany it:
  M e r e k a ingin menyadarkan masyarakat bahwa mereka
  p u n manusia juga.
  They wish to make society aware that they too are human
  beings.
   Indonesia adalah tanah yang subur. Tetapi bukan
   tanahnya saja; penduduknya pun demikian pula.
   Indonesia is a fertile land. But it is not just the land; the
   people also are the same.
2.225     Very similar to its function mentioned in 2.224, pun
can emphasise that an addition is something unexpected,
translated 'even :
                1   Bahan-bahan pangan menjadi mahal dan untuk
   memperolehnya pun sangat susah.
   Foodstuffs have become expensive and even to obtain
   them is very difficult.
   p e s a Bangunarjo menjadi terkenal di seluruh kabupaten
   sampai pedagang kota pun datang ke sana.
   The village of Bangunarjo has become well-known
   throughout the kabupaten, to the extent that even city
   traders come there.
The phrase sedikitpun tidak 'not even a little' is exemplified in
section 2.140.
2 . 2 2 6 The subject can be emphasised by pun while the
predicate is foregrounded by -lah. Examples are given in
section 3.52.
3 CLAUSES
3.1       A clause is a construction which contains a predicate
and, with some minor exceptions, a subject. A clause is either
independent or dependent. An independent clause is one
which can occur alone as a sentence (see 4.63). A dependent
clause cannot occur alone but is always part of a larger
structure. It may occur embedded within a lower-level
structure such as a noun phrase. Dependent clauses may also
combine with other clauses to form sentences; these are called
subordinate clauses. All clause types are described in this
chapter except subordinate clauses, which are discussed in
Chapter Four.
A distinction can be made between basic and derived clauses.
A basic clause is an independent clause which is described
without reference to any other clause type. Derived clauses
can best be described with reference to basic clauses; they can
be either independent or dependent. Under this definition
passive clauses are derived. However, they are discussed
together with active clauses, beginning in section 3.26. Other
derived clauses are described in sections 3.86 to 3.145.
BASIC CLAUSES
3.2       Basic clauses have two types of constituents: nuclear
constituents and adjuncts. Nuclear constituents are obligatory
to the clause, the clause being incomplete without them. For
most clause types the nuclear constituents are subject and
predicate. Subjects are discussed in section 3.3 and predicates
in section 3.4. Other nuclear components of clauses are
discussed elsewhere. For transitive verbal clauses object and,
in some, secondary object, are nuclear. Further, complements
are nuclear in a variety of clause types. Adjuncts are rarely
essential to a construction. They give additional information
on such matters as manner, time, place, and so on; their
absence does not affect the basic meaning of the clause.
Adjuncts are described in 2.165-226.
The normal word order of clause constituents is mentioned in
section 3.41 and changes from that order are discussed in
following sections. One of the functions of changing word
order is to focus attention on a particular clause element. A
number of particles also serve this function (see 3.50ff).
Subject
3.3      The subject of a clause is in general terms the thing
which is being discussed, the 'theme' of the utterance. It
is frequently something which has been mentioned
previously, about which something new (the predicate) is said.
As such it is usually definite (although this is not always the
case - see 3.39).
The subject of a clause is usually a noun phrase or a pronoun
phrase. A number of other constructions can also be subject,
including a simple nominal clause (see 3.143) and a bahwa
clause (see 3.108), as in the following examples:
   Mencari pekerjaan di kota tidak begitu mudah.
   Finding work in the city isn't very easy.
   Bahwa dia suka pada Siti bukan rahasia lagi.
   That he likes Siti isn't a secret any more.
A number of other constructions can function as subject of a
clause; examples are given in the sections dealing with those
constructions.
Some clauses have no subject; these are discussed in section
3.15.
Predicate types
3.4       The structure of predicate phrases is described in
sections 2.132-61. The predicate is the pivot of the clause
and it determines much of the rest of the clause structure.
Clause types are identified by the element functioning as the
predicate centre. Clauses are either verbal, having a verb as
their predicate centre, or non-verbal, having one of a number
of non-verbal constructions as their predicate centre. The
major types of non-verbal clause are discussed in sections
3.5-15. Copulas, which occur in non-verbal clauses, are
discussed in section 3.14. Verbal clauses are discussed in
sections 3.16-40.
Noun clauses
3.5      Noun clauses have a noun phrase as their predicate
centre. Noun clauses are equative; they state that the person
or thing expressed by the predicate is the same as the person
or thing expressed by the subject:
   Dia guru. She is a teacher.
   Ini keputusan saya. This is my decision.
Noun clauses are negated by bukan (see 2.134):
  Dia bukan guru.
  She isn't a teacher.
3.6       Most sub-types of noun can occur in the predicate,
including demonstrative pronouns (see 2.65) and personal
pronouns (see 2.66). Also included are simple nominal
clauses (see 3.143), bahwa clauses (see 3.108), and untuk
clauses (see 3.113). That these function as nouns can be seen
from the fact that the relationship between subject and
predicate is equative, not one of actor and action. Further, the
negative is bukan and the subject and predicate are frequently
separated by copula adalah or ialah (see 3.14), which cannot
occur in verbal clauses:
   Pekerjaannya tiap hari ialah memasak di dapur.
   Her work every day is to cook in the kitchen.
   Kesukaannya bukan membaca novel.
   His past time is not reading novels.
   Hakikatnya ialah bahwa saya benar.
   The truth is that I am correct.
   Maksudnya adalah untuk mendidik rakyat Australia.
   His purpose is to educate the Australian people.
3.7       In a few cases where a noun occurs in the predicate
the construction is not a noun clause, there being no equative
relationship; tidak is the negative, not bukan. Thus sekolah
'school in the following example is acting as a verb, being
       1equivalent to bersekolah 'go to school':
   Anak saya (tidak) sekolah di Rawamangun.
   My children (do not) go to school in Rawamangun.","[257, 258, 259, 260, 261, 262]"
"Partial reduplication
1.26 Partial reduplicaton occurs only with bases which
begin with a consonant. It involves placing before the base a
syllable consisting of the first consonant of the base followed
by e. This type of reduplication is no longer productive in
the language; it occurs with a few bases, mainly nouns, and
cannot be applied to others. The reduplicated word has a
meaning which is the same as that of the single form or
related to. Sometimes, as in the first example below, the
historical relationship is not obvious:
   tangga ladder : tetangga neighbour
   jaka bachelor : jejaka bachelor
   laki husband : lelaki man
   luhur noble : leluhur ancestor
   tamu guest : tetamu guest
   tua old : tetua elders
Imitative reduplication
1.27 In imitative reduplication the two parts of the word
are not identical, though they are similar. Nouns, adjectives
and verbs can all undergo imitative reduplication. The
variation between the two parts of the word can involve either
consonants or vowels. Imitative reduplication is not
productive; new forms cannot be created nor can the two parts
of the word change places. Frequently only the first
component of the word occurs as a simple word. In some
cases neither part can occur alone. The reduplication usually
indicates variety or emphasises the meaning of the first
component. Imitative reduplication is not greatly different
from some types of compounding (see 1.31) and could
alternatively be placed in that category.
1.28 The difference may be only the first consonant:
sayur-mayur 'vegetables' (sayur 'vegetable'), lauk-pauk 'side
dishes' (lauk 'side dish'), ramah-tamah 'hospitable and
friendly' (ramah 'friendly'), cerai-berai 'scattered, dispersed'
(cerai 'separated', berai 'dispersed'), kaya-raya 'very wealthy'
(kaya 'rich , raya 'great').
              1
In one case two consonants are different: pecah-belah
'broken into pieces' (pecah 'broken', belah 'crack').
1.29 The difference may be in the vowels. There may be
only one vowel difference: desas-desus 'rumour', warna-
warni 'all kinds of colours' (warna 'colour'), gerak-gerik
'movements, gestures' (gerak 'movement').
Usually there are two vowel differences. It is most common
for the first component to contain the vowels o...a and the
second component to contain the vowels a..J, although these
are not the only combinations. Often with this type of
imitative reduplication neither part of the word can occur
alone: bolak-balik 'to and fro' (balik 'return'), pontang-
panting 'run helter skelter , obrak-abrik 'destroy, smash to
                           1pieces', mundar-mandir 'back and forth', tindak-tanduk
'behaviour (tindak 'action'), asal-usul 'origin, descent' (asal
          1'origin'), teka-teki 'riddle'.
Compounds
1.30 A compound is a combination of two simple words
which come together to form a complex word. Thus tanda
'sign and tangan 'hand' combine in the compound
     1tandatangan 'signature . Not all compounds are written as a
                          1single word; some are usually hyphenated, such as pemuda-
pemudi 'young people', while others are often written as two
words, such as salah paham 'misunderstand'. There is
considerable inconsistency in the usage of different people.
It is usual for such forms to be written without a space or with
a hyphen when they form the base for a derived word:
kesalahpahaman, kesalah-pahaman 'misunderstanding'.
A sequence of words may not be a compound when standing
alone but may become such when acting as the base for an
affixed form. Thus peti es 'ice box' is a phrase rather than a
compound, but it is a compound base in the verbal form
mempeti-eskan 'leave for later consideration'.
 1.31 Some compounds resemble imitative reduplication
(see 1.27-9). In these compounds, however, there are
differences of both vowel and consonant; the two parts can
also have different numbers of syllables. The parts occur as
separate words, usually with very similar meanings. These
forms are almost entirely adjectives; they are similar in
meaning to one or both parts alone but the meaning is more
intensive: gelap gulita 'pitch dark' (gelap 'dark', gulita 'dark'),
kelam kabut 'foggy, murky' (kelam 'dull, overcast', kabut
'fog'), lemah lembut 'gentle, graceful' (lemah 'weak', lembut
'soft'), sunyi senyap 'deathly still' (sunyi 'lonely, quiet', senyap
'quiet, deserted'), terang benderang 'very bright' (terang
 bright', benderang 'bright').
1.32 A compound may consist of two words occurring as
noun and adjective or as noun and modifying noun which are
treated as a single unit for the purpose of affixation, that is,
they combine as the base of a complex word. Many of these,
such as kambing hitam 'scapegoat', have an idiomatic
meaning. As idioms they act like single words, not only
combining for the purposes of affixation, but not being
separable when occurring without affixation. Thus in the
above example the idiom is lost if the words are separated by
yang; kambing yang hitam can only mean 'a goat which is
black (see also 2.45). As mentioned in 1.30, some
     1combinations, such as peti es 'ice box , only have idiomatic
                                         1meaning when forming the base of a complex word.
1.33 Some compound nouns form the base for verbs,
such as the following:
   kambing hitam scapegoat : mengkambing-hitamkan put
       the blame on, make a scapegoat
   tandatangan signature : menandatangani sign
   titik berat centre of gravity, most important aspect :
       menitik-beratkan stress, emphasise
A few compound nouns consist of two verb bases. These then
form the base for complex verbs:
   serah terima transfer (serah 'surrender , terima 'receive') :
                                             1      menyerah-terimakan handover, transfer (authority)
Some compounds function both as intransitive and transitive
verbs:
   ikut serta participate : mengikutsertakan include, let
       (someone) participate
   putar balik turn over : memutarbalikkan turn
       (something) over
   bertanggung-jawab be responsible : mempertanggung-
      jawabkan account for, justify
1.34 The following compounds function as both nouns
and verbs:
   makan pagi breakfast; eat breakfast
   makan siang lunch; eat lunch
   makan malam dinner; eat dinner
1.35 In a number of cases two nouns can be juxtaposed to
form a compound where the words are separated by 'and' in
English. In other cases two words of similar meaning are
compounded:
   anak cucu children and grandchildren
   kasih sayang love and affection
   pemuda pemudi youths, young men and women
   putra putri sons and daughters
   suami istri married couple, husband and wife
   harta benda wealth, property
   sanak saudara relatives
   warta berita newsInfixes
1.36 Infixation is not productive and only a limited
number of infixed forms occur Because of this infixed
forms are no longer felt by most people to contain an affix
and they are listed separately from their bases in dictionaries.
The infixes are -em-, -el-, -er-. The meaning of the infix is
unpredictable. Infixed forms have the same meaning as the
simple form or a meaning related to it:
   gigi tooth : gerigi serration
   suling flute : seruling flute
   tapak palm, sole : telapak sole, palm
   tunjuk point : telunjuk index finger
   getar vibrate : gemetar tremble
1.37 A few forms infixed with -em- occur only as a
reduplication of the base form of the word. Such words
convey a meaning which is similar to that of the base alone or
which is an intensity of the meaning of the base:
   kilau shine : kilau-kemilau shine brightly
   tali rope : tali-temali all sorts of rope
   turun descend : turun-temurun hereditary
In at least one case the base does not occur alone: gilang-
gemilang 'brilliant'.","[49, 50, 51, 52, 53]"
"THE PREDICATE PHRASE
2.132 The predicate is the essential component of every
clause (see 3.4). A predicate phrase contains an obligatory
predicate centre, which is a verb or one of a number of
phrases, including noun phrase, adjective phrase, and
prepositional phrase. The predicate centre determines the
type of clause, as discussed in section 3.4.
In addition to the obligatory centre a predicate phrase may
contain a number of other elements, including markers of
time, modality, negation and reciprocity.
Negation
2.133 There are four negative words: bukan, tidak, belum
and jangan. Belum 'not yet' combines the meanings of
bukan/tidak plus temporal marker sudah and is discussed in
section 2.156. Jangan 'don't' occurs in imperative
constructions and is discussed in section 4.35.
2.134 Bukan negates a noun; that is, it is used if the
predicate centre contains a noun or noun phrase:
   Dia bukan guru.
   She isn't a teacher.
2.135 Tidak negates all types of predicate other than
nouns, including verbs, adjectives, prepositional phrases:
   Mereka tidak menolong kami.
   They didn't help us.
   Dia tidak di sini.
   She isn't here.
   Hawa Bandung tidak terlalu panas.
   The climate of Bandung is not too hot.
2.136 A number of prepositions, including karena
'because', untuk 'for', seperti 'like', can be negated by either
bukan or tidak:
   Ini bukan/tidak untuk saudara.
   These are not for you.
   Penyakitnya bukan/tidak karena itu.
   His illness is not because of that.
   Ini bukan/tidak seperti desa kita.
   This isn't like our village.
2.137 Bukan can replace tidak. As such it is emphatic,
implying that a contradictory statement could follow:
   Dia bukan bodoh.
   He isn't stupid (but there is another reason for his
   behaviour).
The contradiction can be expressed, for instance, as a clause
beginning with melainkan 'but rather':
   Dia bukan bodoh, melainkan malas saja.
   He's not stupid but just lazy.
Such constructions are discussed in section 4.84.
2.138 Several variants of tidak occur. Tak has a literary
flavour for most Indonesians. It was once obligatory before
ter- verbs (see 1.272), although in modern Indonesian tidak
is also common in this position:
    Tak ada dosa yang tak terampuni.
    There are no sins which cannot be forgiven.
Tiada is a literary form meaning the same as tidak 'not' and
tidak ada 'there isn't':
   Aku tiada berkata begitu.
   I did not say that.
   Di daerah itu tiada air.
   In that region there is no water.
2.139 With some verbs tidak can be replaced by kurang
'less' to indicate a lessened degree of negation or to soften the
impact of the negation:
    Aku kurang percaya akan kabar itu.
    I didn't really believe that news.
2.140 Both tidak and bukan can be emphasised by sama
sekali '(not) at all, definitely (not)' and sedikitpun '(not) even
a little':
    Ini sama sekali bukan uang orang lain.
    This is definitely not other people's money.
    Saya sama sekali tidak tergantung pada dia.
    I'm not in the least dependent on him.
    Mereka sedikitpun tidak mempedulikan nasib orang lain.
    They don't in the slightest care about the fate of other
    people.
2.141 Tidak can occur in several phrases besides the
predicate phrase, including adjective phrases (see 2.104), and
with indefinite numbers (see 2.113). Bukan occurs as a
sentence tag, irrespective of which negative would occur in the
main clause (see 4.9). It also occurs in some correlative
structures (see 4.83ff).
Temporal markers
2.142 In many languages, including English, it is necessary
to specify when an action occurs in relation to the present or
in relation to some other event, either in the form of the verb
or with obligatory aspect markers (as in 'ate', 'has eaten , 'had
                                                          1eaten', etc.). In Indonesian the form of the verb does not
change to indicate tense or aspect. A sentence such as Dia
pergi ke kantor carries no indication of whether the verb
refers to a regular occurrence or to a single occurrence and, if
the latter, when it happens in relation to the present. This is
inferred by listeners from the context within which the
utterance is made.
Time can be indicated by adjuncts of time (see 2.182), such
as setiap hari 'every day' and tadi pagi 'this morning (past)':
   Dia pergi ke kantor setiap hari.
   He goes to the office every day.
   Tadi pagi dia pergi ke kantor.
   This morning he went to the office.
Time can also be indicated by a set of temporal markers
within the predicate. These indicate that the action has
occurred, is occurring, or is yet to occur in relation to the
moment of utterance or in relation to some other event
referred to.
In studies of Indonesian grammar these are usually referred
to as 'aspect markers', indicating completeness or continuation
of an action. Because of this interpretation akan 'will' is
usually grouped apart, with modals or 'auxiliary verbs'.
2.143 Sudah usually indicates that an action has occurred
or that a state has been achieved:
   Ali sudah bangun.
   Ali has woken up.
   Ali sudah sembuh.
   Ali has recovered.
With verbs which indicate a state sudah usually refers both to
the action which begins the state and to the continuation of
the state:
   Dia sudah tidur.
   He has gone to bed/He is asleep.
   Dia sudah duduk.
   He has sat down/He is seated.
With such verbs, however, sudah can also indicate that the
action is complete; context indicating which is meant:
   Dia sudah tidur.
   He has slept (and is now ready for work).
Sudah can occur with other predicates besides verbs, 'already   1usually occurring in the English translation:
   Dia sudah tinggi/di sini/guru.
   He is already tall/here/a teacher.
2.144 Telah has the same meaning as sudah:
   Dia telah pergi/makan.
   He has gone/eaten.
The difference between the two is in register; telah is almost
entirely confined to writing and very formal speech, while
sudah occurs in all registers from informal speech to the most
formal styles.
2.145 Sedang indicates that an action is in progress,
sometimes glossed 'in the process of:
   Mereka sedang makan.
   They are eating.
2.146 Lagi and tengah can replace sedang, although they
are less frequent and not used by all speakers:
   Mereka lagi makan.
   They are eating.
   Apartment Citraland kini tengah dibangun di Jalan
   Satrio.
   The Citraland apartments are in the process of being build
   in Satrio Road.
2.147 Masih indicates that an action is still occurring:
   Dia masih makan.
   She is still eating.
Like sudah it can occur with other predicate types:
   Dia masih muda/di sini/pegawai.
   She is still young/here/an employee.
2.148 Akan indicates a future event or state:
   Kami akan makan nanti.
   We will eat soon.
   Tugasnya akan berat
   His task will be heavy.
2.149 Bakal indicates a future event. It is less common
than akan and only refers to action a considerable time in the
future. Thus it can replace akan in the sentence below but
not in the two sentences illustrating akan in 2.148:
   Dia akan/bakal menjadi presiden.
   He ^ill become president.
It does not occur with other than verbal predicates. Where
bakal precedes a noun it is part of the noun phrase, meaning
'prospective, future': bakal presiden 'future president'.
2.150 Baru indicates that an action or state has just
occurred:
   Dia baru tiba/mandi.
   He has just arrived/bathed.
   Umurnya baru empat tahun.
   She's just four years old.
Baru is often followed by saja for emphasis:
  Dia baru saja tiba.
  He's only just arrived.
2.151 Pernah indicates that an action occurred in the far
past. It cannot be used of recent events. It corresponds to
'ever' but unlike the English word it is not restricted to
negative and interrogative sentences. It is also translatable
'once':
   Dia pernah belajar di Paris.
   She once studied in Paris.
2.152 In examples in sections 2.143-51 temporal markers
refer to time in relation to the moment of utterance. Time
relative to another event may also be indicated. In the
following examples the point of reference is an event in the
past. Thus sudah and telah indicate that an action had
occurred before another action, and so on:
   Sebelum meninggal dia telah menceritakan riwayat
   hidupnya.
   Before dying he had related his life story.
   Ketika saya sampai di rumahnya Tom sudah bangun.
   When I arrived at his house Tom had already got up.
   Ketika saya sampai di rumahnya Tom sedang makan.
   When I arrived at his house Tom was eating.
If the point of reference is the past akan indicates that
something was going to happen (although sometimes it does
not occur), translatable 'would; was going to':
   Dia berjanji akan datang.
   He promised he would come.
   Ketika akan menyerang Batavia, Sultan Agung lebih
   dulu mendirikan lumbung-lumbung padi di sepanjang
   jalan yang akan dilalui bala tentaranya.
   When he was going to attack Batavia, Sultan Agung first of
   all built rice barns along the road which his army was
   going to use.  4
Modals
2.153 Modals, often called auxiliary verbs in studies of
Indonesian, refer to such concepts as possibility, ability and
necessity. Grammars of Indonesian vary considerably as to
the words they place in this category, and not all modals
function in precisely the same way. The main modals are:
   dapat, bisa can, be able      This example is from Kaswanti Purwo (1984: 81).
w    boleh may, have permission
    harus, mesti must
    perlu must
    mampu, sanggup able, have the capacity
    sempat have the opportunity, have the time, be able
A number of other words usually grouped with modals,
especially ingin and mau 'want', differ both grammatically
and semantically from modals and are best treated as full
verbs.
Modals usually occur with verbs:
   Kamu boleh pergi tapi harus pulang sebelum jam lima.
   You may go but you must come home before five o'clock.
Some modals can occur with adjectives and locatives:
  Tidak banyak orang yang bisa dekat dengan Kim Jong
  n.
  Not many people are able to be close to Kim Jong II.
  Seorang polisi harus tinggi.
  A policeman must be tall.
  Saya harus ke sana.
  I have to go there.","[222, 223, 224, 225, 226, 227, 228, 229]"
"REFLEXIVE PHRASES
2.162 A reflexive phrase consists minimally of reflexive
pronoun diri 'self. A minimal reflexive phrase usually occurs
as the object of a verb and indicates that the object is the same
person as the subject of the verb:
   Kamu harus menjaga diri baik-baik.
   You must look after yourself properly.
   Tuan rumah memperkenalkan diri kepada kami.
   The host introduced himself to us.
   Kami ""mengabdikan diri kepada tanah air.
   We devote ourselves to the nation.
2.163 Sometimes a transitive verb followed by diri occurs
where English uses an intransitive verb:
   Penjahat itu melarikan diri.
   The criminal fled.
   Perdana menteri mengundurkan diri.
   The prime minister resigned.
Other examples of this formation where English uses an
intransitive verb are the following. In some cases an
intransitive verb can also occur, as indicated:
    meloloskan diri/lolos escape
    menarik diri withdraw
    mencalonkan diri stand (for office)
    mengkhususkan diri specialise (in a certain field)
    menyerahkan diri/menyerah surrender
When membunuh 'kill' occurs with diri prefix meN- is usually
lost: bunuh diri 'commit suicide'.
2.164 The full reflexive phrase is diri + possessive pronoun
+ sendiri. Third person -nya corresponds to a plural as well
as a singular third person subject:
   dirinya sendiri himself/herself/themselves
Either the possessive pronoun or sendiri can be omitted. The
addition of either is more emphatic than diri alone;
occurrence of sendiri makes the phrase particularly emphatic:
   Kasim menganggap dirinya lain dari orang lain.
   Kasim considers himself different from other people.
   Sekarang anda pasti sudah mempersiapkan diri anda.
   Now you have certainly prepared yourself
   Tidak ada orang lain yang menghargaiku sebagai
   manusia. Karena itu aku harus menghargai diriku
   sendiri.
   No one else respects me as a person. Because of that I
   must respect myself.
   Dia gemar mencandai dirinya sendiri.
   He's fond of joking at himself.
If the object is a bahwa clause (see 3.111) a reflexive phrase
still occurs, whether bahwa is present or omitted (English
does not use a reflexive if corresponding 'that' occurs):
    Dia menyatakan dirinya bukan familiku lagi.
    He declared himself no longer a relative of mine.
    Mereka percaya bahwa dirinya lebih unggul dari orang
    lain.
    They believe that they are superior to other people.
A reflexive phrase can also follow a preposition if it refers to
the same person as the actor (the subject of an active clause or
the agent of a passive clause). Following a preposition diri
cannot occur alone:
   Dia jengkel terhadap dirinya sendiri.
   He is annoyed at himself.
   Kata-kata itu saya tujukan kepada diri saya sendiri.
   I directed those words at myself.
   Narkotika itu dia beli tak hanya untuk pasien tapi juga
   untuk dirinya sendiri.
   He bought those narcotics not only for the patients but
   also for himself.
Sometimes a reflexive phrase is used instead of a personal
pronoun even though the action is not reflexive, that is, the
reflexive phrase does not identify the same person as the
actor. This is usually done for emphasis (although sometimes
the speaker may be confused as to whether the action is
reflexive or not):
   Dia menolak untuk diperiksa mengenai tuduhan-tuduhan
   terhadap dirinya.
   He refused to be examined on the charges against him.
   Saya siap menghadapi hukuman apa pun yang akan
   dijatuhkan atas diri saya.
   I am prepared to face any punishment which befalls me.
A phrase consisting of diri followed by a noun, meaning
something like 'the person of [noun]' can occur in a non-
reflexive context:
   Dia akan menulis buku tentang diri Presiden.
   He is going to write a book about the President.
   Raksasa itu melambangkan nafsu-nafsu jahat dalam diri
   manusia*
   The giant symbolises the evil passions within humans.
The reflexive phrase can be subject of a passive clause (see
3.40).","[233, 234, 235]"
"Transitive and intransitive
3.18 If an action or event involves only one participant it
is expressed by an intransitive clause. An intransitive clause
has two nuclear components, a subject, which indicates the
actor, and a predicate, which contains an intransitive verb (see
lA66ff):
   Mereka bekerja.
   They are working.
   Siti menangis.
   Siti is crying.
Intransitive clauses frequently contain one or more adjuncts
(see 2.165); the following includes adjuncts of time, location
and manner:
   Setiap hari mereka bekerja keras di pabrik.
   Every day they work hard in the factory.
3.19 In addition to the actor some actions or events
involve another person or thing which is affected by the
action. This is expressed by a noun phrase following the
verb, called the object. Clauses which have an object are
called transitive clauses and verbs which occur in these clauses
are called transitive verbs (see 1.186ff).
   Saya membantu ibu.
    I am helping mother.
   Ali menjual mobilnya.
   Ali sold his can
A transitive clause minimally consists of a subject, a predicate,
and an object, as in the above examples. In addition, a
number of adjuncts can occur. In the following construction
an adjunct of time and a recipient occur:
   Tahun lalu All menjual mobilnya kepada Hasan.
   Last year Ali sold his car to Hasan.
Ditransitive clauses
3.20 The object may express one of a number of
participants. In the examples in 3.19 it expresses a patient. It
may also express a beneficiary (see 1.206) or a recipient (see
1.212). In such clauses another noun phrase, the secondary
object, must occur to express the patient:
   Mereka mengirimi kami surat.
   They sent us a letter.
   Ibu membuatkan Siti rok.
   Mother made Siti a skirt.
In the above examples the final noun, surat letter' in the first
sentence and rok 'skirt' in the second, is the secondary object.
Clauses which require two objects are usually called
ditransitive clauses. In grammars of English, and in some
grammars of Indonesian, the person who receives (such as
kami in the first example above) or benefits (such as Siti in
the second example above) is usually called the indirect
object, while the patient (surat and rok) is called the direct
object. In this description the noun immediately following
the verb is called the primary object and the other noun is
called the secondary object. As explained in sections 1.206
and 1.229, the clause can be rearranged so that the secondary
object becomes the primary object; in this case the recipient
or beneficiary must be expressed by a prepositional phrase
(see also the examples in 3.17).
Pseudo-intransitive verbs
3.21 While most transitive verbs require the object to be
expressed there are some whose object need not be expressed.
The object of such verbs can be omitted when it is obvious or
unimportant, as in:
   Wendy sedang membaca.
   Wendy is reading.
The action expressed by membaca 'read carries over to an
                                            1object. However, interest is often on the fact that the action is
being performed rather than on what it is being done to; in
such cases the object is not expressed, as in the above
example. Such verbs are sometimes called intransitive.
However, a real intransitive verb refers to an action which does
not carry over to another person or thing and involves only
the actor, such as tidur 'sleep and berdiri 'stand . Verbs like
                               1                   1membaca 'read' describe actions which have an object, even if
it is not expressed. They are therefore transitive and have a
passive form. Some grammars call them pseudo-intransitive
verbs. A large number of transitive verbs can occur without
an object being expressed, including:
    makan eat                      menulis write
    minum drink                    melukis paint
    menyapu sweep                  menggambar draw
    memasak cook                   menyeterika iron
    mencangkul hoe                 menggergaji saw
All verbs acting in this way are simple transitive verbs (see
1.187). Verbs with affixes per-, -kan or -i cannot omit the
object. Where suffix -kan and -i are optional (see 1.210 and
1.224) only the variant without the suffix can occur without
an object:
   Anak-anak sedang menyanyikan lagu.
   The children are singing a song.
   Anak-anak sedang menyanyi (lagu).
   The children are singing (a song).
   Kami bisa menyeberangi sungai di sini.
   We can cross the river here.
   Kami bisa menyeberang (sungai) di sini.
   We can cross (the river) here.
In English the list of pseudo-intransitive verbs is longer than
in Indonesian; an English pseudo-intransitive verb sometimes
corresponds to both a transitive and intransitive verb in
Indonesian. Thus pseudo-intransitive 'enter' corresponds to
either transitive memasuki or intransitive masuk:
   Dia memasuki kamar.
   He entered the room.
   Dia masuk.
   He entered.
Formal distinction between transitive and intransitive verbs
3.22 In Indonesian a clear distinction is made between
intransitive and transitive verbs. By its form a verb almost
always identifies itself as transitive or intransitive. Exceptions
are intransitive verbs with prefix meN-, such as menangis 'cry',
which 'look like' simple transitive verbs, and a very few
intransitive verbs which have a suffix (see 3.25). In English
many verbs function both transitively and intransitively. . In
Indonesian this is almost never the case; there is almost always
some difference in form between an intransitive and transitive
verb having the same base. Each (a) construction below is an
intransitive clause; each (b) construction is the transitive
counterpart. The verbs always differ, while in English they do
not:
   a. Anaknya mandi.
           His child is bathing.
   b. Dia memandikan anaknya.
           He is bathing his child.
   a. Bis berhenti di depan gedung sekolah.
           The bus stopped in front of the school.
   b. Sopir menghentikan bis di depan gedung sekolah.
           The driver stopped the bus in front of the school.
In the above examples the transitive verbs have causative
suffix -kan. Other examples are given in section 1.198. In
some cases transitive and intransitive verbs differ only in their
prefix, the intransitive verb, sometimes indicating reflexive
action, having ber- and the transitive verb having meN-, such
as berubah '(undergo) change' and mengubah 'change
(something)':
   Wajah Jakarta sudah berubah.
   The face of Jakarta has changed.
   Gedung-gedung pencakar langit sudah mengubah wajah
   Jakarta.
   Sky scrapers have changed the face of Jakarta.
Other pairs include:
  bercukur shave : mencukur shave (someone/something)
   bergaruk(-garuk) scratch : menggaruk scratch
      (something)
  berputar turn, revolve : memutar turn, revolve
      (something)
  berhias dress up : menghias decorate, dress (something)
     up
  berias put on make up : merias dress (someone) up
  berbentuk be in the form of : membentuk form
      (something)
  bergantung hang, be suspended : menggantung hang
     (something) up
Transitive and intransitive in Indonesian and English
3.23 Some intransitive verbs correspond to transitive verbs
in English. Corresponding to the object of the English verb is
a prepositional phrase, as in the first example below (see also
1.219), or a complement, as in the second example.
Although resembling an object, the complement cannot
become the subject in a passive construction (see 3.63).
   Pak Parno cinta akan istrinya.
   Mr Parno loves his wife.
   Mereka belajar bahasa Jepang.
   They are learning Japanese.
3.24 Some Indonesian transitive verbs are translated by
English verbs which take a following preposition (called
phrasal verbs in English), such as mencari 'look for :
                                                    1   Ali mencari adiknya di pasar.
   Ali looked for his sister at the market.
Others, with exemplary objects in parentheses, include:
   melamar (pekerjaan) apply for (work)
   meminta (uang) ask for (money)
   membayar (barang) pay for (goods)
   melihat (foto) look at (photo)
   memikirkan (hal itu) think about (that matter)
  meminang (gadis) propose to (a girl)
Intransitive verbs with a suffix
3.25 A few verbs with a suffix are not transitive; they do
not have a passive form and the following noun is therefore a
complement, not an object. These include merupakan
'constitute, be' and menyerupai 'resemble':
   Pulau Bali merupakan tujuan yang paling populer untuk
   turis asing.
   Bali is the most popular destination for foreign tourists.
   Dia menyerupai ayahnya.
   He resembles his father.
The verbs mencukupi and memadai 'satisfy; be sufficient' can
occur with or without a complement:
   Gaji mereka tidak mencukupi.
   Their salary is not sufficient.
   Gaji itu tidak mencukupi kebutuhan mereka.
   The salary does not fulfil their needs.","[269, 270, 271, 272, 273, 274]"
"SOUND CHANGES IN COMPLEX
WORDS
1.3      A number of sound changes occur when affixes and
bases combine. The major changes are discussed in sections
1.4 to 1.8. Other sound changes affecting affixes are minor
and are dealt with in discussion of the individual affixes.
The following symbols are used in the discussion of such
sound changes. A plus sign (+) indicates a sequence of affix
and base. An arrow (—>) indicates the form which results
from their combination. Thus ber- + renang berenang
means that when prefix ber- and base renang are combined
the result is the complex word berenang.
Prefixes ber-, per-, ter-
1.4       Prefixes ber-, per-, ter- and circumfixes which have
ber- or per- as their prefix component undergo the changes
listed below:
 The r of the prefix is lost under the following circumstances:
-When the base begins with r:
   ber- + renang                     berenang
   per- + rusak                      perusak
   ter       + rasa            —>    terasa
When the base begins with the sound combination CerC,
where C represents any consonant:
  ber- + serta                         beserta
  ber- + terbang + -an —» beterbangan
   per-     + kerja          + -an       -» pekerjaan
   ter-     + pergok                        tepergok
Loss of r before a base beginning with CerC is not entirely
regular; in a few words it does not occur or is optional. Thus:
   ter-       + percaya             tepercaya, terpercaya
Prefix ter- usually becomes te- with the bases lanjur and
lantar. The ter- forms are regarded by some as substandard
and are not listed in all dictionaries. In some dictionaries te-
is regarded as part of the base rather than as a prefix:
    ter-     + lanjur —» telanjur, terlanjur
    ter-     + lantar —> telantar, terlantar
With base ajar the r in ber- and per- is replaced by 1:
  ber- + ajar                          —> belajar
  per- + ajar                + -an           pelajaran
Prefixes meN- and peN-
1.5       The capital N represents a sound which changes
depending on the first sound of the base. N can appear as
one of the nasals m, n, ny, ng, or as zero. Sometimes the nasal
comes before the first sound of the base and sometimes it
replaces the first sound. The rules are illustrated by meN- but
apply equally to peN- and peN-*..-an. Exceptions to the rules
are given in section 1.6 and the affixation with single syllable
bases in section 1.7.
N becomes ng before a vowel
If the word begins with a vowel prefix meng- is attached:
    meN- + ajar              —>    mengajar
    meN- + ekspor                  mengekspor
    meN- + erang                   mengerang
    meN- + olah              —»    mengolah
    meN- + urus              —»    mengurus
N becomes m with initial b, p, f
If the word begins with b, p or f prefix mem- occurs. Initial p
is lost:
    meN- + beli             —» membeli
    meN- + pakai —» memakai
   meN-     +     fitnah     —> memfitnah
N becomes n with initial d, t, c, j, sy, z
If the word begins with d, t, c, j, sy, z prefix men- occurs.
Initial t is lost:
    meN- + dengar                              mendengar
    meN- + tulis                               menulis
                                                  — >
    meN- + cari                                mencari
                                                  —>    meN- + jual                                menjual
                                                  —>    meN- + syarat              + -kan —> mensyaratkan
    meN- -f ziarah + -i                        menziarahi
N becomes ny with initial s
If the word begins with s prefix meny- occurs. Initial s is lost:
       meny- + sewa —> menyewa
N becomes ng with initial g, k, h, kh
If the word begins with g, k, h or kh prefix meng- occurs.
Initial k is lost:
    meN- + ganggu                      mengganggu
                                      —>    meN- + kirim                       mengirim
    meN- + hilang                      menghilang
    meN- + khawatir + -kan             mengkhawatirkan
                                      — >N is lost before other initial sounds
If the word begins with 1, r, m, n, ny, ng, w, or y prefix
occurs:
    meN- + lihat                            melihat
    meN- + rasa                             merasa
    meN- + masak                            memasak
    meN- + nanti                            menanti
    meN- + nyanyi                           menyanyi
                                            — »    meN- + nganga                           menganga
    meN- + wakil                + -i -> mewakili
    meN- + yakin                + -i        meyakini
Sometimes the same sequence of sounds can result from
different combinations of N and initial base sound so that the
initial sound of the base cannot be predicted from the form of
the derived verb. Thus, ny results both from meny + s (which
is lost) and from me + ny:
   menyewa          from      meny-       +    sewa
   menyanyi         from      me-         +    nyanyi
The sequence of ng and a vowel can result from three
combinations:
  mengarang from meng- + karang
  mengarang from meng- + arang
  menganga from me-            + nganga
N undergoes the same changes with affixes peN- and peN-«..-
an as it does with meN-, for instance:
   peN- + tulis                        -> penulis
   peN- + tulis              + -an —> penulisan
Exceptions to the rules for N
1.6      If prefix meN- is followed by prefix per- the initial
p of per- is not lost:
   meN- + per- + lebar                —> memperlebar
   meN + per- + oleh                  -> memperoleh
If the base begins with the sequence perC, that is, per
followed by a consonant, the initial p is lost irregularly:
   meN- + percaya + -i                        mempercayai
   meN- + pergok + -i                         mempergoki,
                                              memergoki
   meN- + percik             + -i - > memerciki
The p of prefix per- and of base-initial perC is lost following
prefix peN-:
   peN- + per- + satu                      —> pemersatu
   peN- + per- + oleh + -an —» pemerolehan
   peN- + perkosa                          -> pemerkosa
With some bases initial p, t, s, and k are not lost. If s is not lost
N becomes n. With the exception of verbs beginning with
perC, this is almost entirely confined to words borrowed from
other languages. The initial sound is most likely to be
retained if the word is still felt to be foreign. Thus retention
of the sound is common in words beginning with consonant
clusters, which do not occur in indigenous words:
    meN- + proklamasi + -kan                 memproklamasikan
   meN- + traktir            —> mentraktir
   meN- + swadaya + -kan        menswadayakan
   meN- + klasifikasi + -kan —> mengklasifikasikan
Initial p, t, s and k are sometimes retained in borrowings even
where there is no initial consonant cluster. As a borrowing
becomes more accepted as an Indonesian word the tendency
increases for people to use the more regular form without the
initial consonant of the base. During a transition period both
forms occur:
    meN- + protes                       memprotes, memrotes
    meN- + taat + -i                    mentaati, menaati
    meN- + sukses + -kan —> mensukseskan,
                                        menyukseskan
    meN- + kritik                — >    mengkritik, mengritik
The time at which the 'changeover' occurs and the length of
the transition period differs from word to word (and to some
extent from speaker to speaker). Thus, mentaati and menaati
'obey' continue to exist side-by-side, while after many years
of use menterjemahkan 'translate' was completely replaced by
menerjemahkan in a very short period during the mid-1980s.
In a few non-borrowed words base-initial p remains. The
word mempengaruhi 'influence , from base pengaruh, may
                                 1result from interpretation of the word as having prefix peN-.
However, mempunyai 'possess', from base punya, must be
regarded as an exception in the modern language.
With kaji both possibilities occur but with different meanings:
mengaji 'recite the Quran', pengajian 'Quran reading', and
mengkaji 'to research, carry out study', pengkajian 'study,
research'.
Prefix peng- occurs with the bases lihat, rajin and lepas:
penglihatan 'sight', pengrajin 'craftsman', penglepasan
'release' (as well as pelepasan). During the early 1990s there
was an increasing tendency for pengrajin to be regularised as
perajin.
Initial sy is lost from the base syair: menyair 'write poetry ,     1
penyair poet'.
MeN- and peN- with single syllable bases
U         With single syllable bases, which are all borrowings
from other languages, meN- and peN- optionally become
menge- and penge-. The regular form of the prefix can
occur instead, in which case initial p, t, s, k are not lost Some
people recognise only the menge- variant as being standard*.
The frequency of either form depends both on the individual
base and personal preference:
   meN- + pel                            —>   mengepel, mempel
   meN- + cek                            — >  mengecek, mencek
   meN-           bom                         mengebom,
                                              membom
   meN- + tik                                 mengetik, mentik
   meN- + sah + -kan                         mengesahkan,
                                             mensahkan
   meN- + rem                         - > mengerem, meremDerivatives with peN- and peN-*..-an act similarly:
  peN- + bom + -an —> pengeboman,
                                         pemboman
  peN- + sah             + -an —> pengesahan,
                                         pensahan
With passive prefix di- (see 3.27) the base occurs in the
normal way: dibom, dipel, and so on.
The indigenous word tahu 'know is interpreted as a single
                                     1syllable and only the prefixes menge- and penge- occur with
it:
    meN- + tahu + -i                    mengetahui
    peN- + tahu + -an —> pengetahuan     Tata Bahasa Baku Bahasa Indonesia (1993: 120) recognises only
     the menge* forms as standard. Chaer (1988: 270) takes the same
     position and advises against the use of forms such as mempel and
     mentik. On the other hand, Badudu (1986: 89-90) regards both
     forms as standard. Echols and Shadily (1989) and Kamus Besar
     Bahasa Indonesia (1991) frequently list both forms.
In the passive of this word ke- is retained: diketahui. With the
borrowed word tik 'type ke- optionally occurs in the passive:
                          1ditik, diketik. Because of this both ketik and tik are
recognised as bases. Some people regard menge- as
containing a prefix ke-, which functions to form a two-
syllable base, such forms being the most common base in
indigenous words. The retention of nge in reduplicated bases
(see 1.8) strengthens this view.
Reduplicated bases with meN- and peN-
1.8      When a base prefixed with meN- is reduplicated N is
retained on the reduplicated base where the initial consonant
has been lost. The symbol R represents full base
reduplication (see 1.10):
   meN- + bagi-R                       —»membagi-bagi
   meN-          amat-R + -i -> mengamat-amati
   meN- + minta-R                        meminta-minta
   meN- + pijit-R                      —>memijit-mijit
   meN- + tulis-R                      —>menulis-nulis
   meN- + kayuh-R                      —>mengayuh-ngayuh
When meN- is realised as menge- before a one-syllable base
(see 1.7) the sequence nge occurs on the reduplicated base:
   meN- + cek-R                  mengecek-ngecekWORD-FORMING PROCESSES
 1.9       The word-forming processes in Indonesian are
 discussed in the remainder of this chapter. The individual
 affixes, their functions and the combinations in which they
 occur are discussed from section 1.44 to the end of the
 chapter. Some general word-forming processes are not
-restricted to particular classes of words; these are the various
 types of reduplication and compounding.
Some word-forming processes, including some forms of
affixation, are productive. That is, the process is not restricted
to particular words but can be applied to new words as they
appear in the language or to already existing words to which
it has not been applied before. Some processes, such as
infixing, are not productive; the process occurs only with
particular words. Where a process is not productive this is
pointed out in the relevant section.","[36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43]"
"Coordination
4.64 Coordinators, or coordinating conjunctions, link two
independent clauses in a sentence. Coordinators which link
two clauses include:
   dan and
   atau or
   tetapi, tapi, akan tetapi but
   lalu then
   kemudian then, afterwards
   serta and, as well as
   dan bahkan and moreover, what's more
   sedangkan while, whereas
   sementara while (at the same time)
   sambil, seraya while (of two actions performed by the
      same person)
   Dia bekerja di bank sedangkan istrinya menjadi guru
   SMA.
   He works in a bank while his wife is a high school teacher.
   Minah menjaga anak-anak sementara saya pergi
   berbelanja.
   Minah minded the children while I went shopping.
If the coordinate clauses have the same subject it is usual for it
to be ellipted from the second clause (see also 4.111):
    Mobilnya terus melaju kencang, lalu putar ke kiri.
    His car continued to travel along fast, then turned left.
    Dia bergaul dengan bebas dan bahkan membantu
    dengan pekerjaan kecil-kecilan.
    He mixes freely and moreover helps with odd jobs.
    Diambilnya mangga itu, kemudian dikupasnya hati-hati.
    He took the mango then he peeled it carefully.
The coordinators serta and sambil require the two clauses to
have the same subject, the second being obligatorily ellipted:
   Mereka menaati nasihat orang tua serta mengikuti adat
   kebiasaan kita.
   They obey the advice of their parents and follow our
   customs.
   Ibu memandang kami sambil tersenyum.
   Mother looked at us while smiling.
Coordination of phrases and words
4.65 As well as linking clauses coordinators can link two
phrases or words. The two elements linked must be of the
same kind:
   laut yang bening dan tenang
   a clear and calm sea
   murid yang pandai tetapi malas
   a clever but lazy pupil
   Pak dan Bu Marto sudah lama kawin»
   Mr and Mrs Marto have been married for a long time.
   Mereka sudah pergi ke Jakarta atau ke Bandung.
   They have gone to Jakarta or to Bandung.
   Dia hanya duduk dan menangis saja.
   He just sat and cried.
When two transitive verbs are coordinate they have the same
subject and object. The subject, along with any components
of the predicate covering both verbs, occurs before the first
verb and the object after the second verb:
   Majikan tidak bisa sembarangan memperkerjakan dan
   membayar pembantunya.
   An employer cannot employ and pay his servants just as
   he pleases.
4.66 Some coordinators do not link all construction
types. A number, such as sedangkan and sementara (see
4.64), only link clauses. Among coordinators which do not
link clauses are the following.
Two adjectives can be linked by lagi 'as well as :
                                             1   Terrier mungil lagi cerdas.
   The terrier is cute as well as intelligent.
Two nouns or noun phrases can be linked by beserta 'and,
together with':
   Para karyawan beserta keluarganya bahagia dan
   sejahtera.
   The employees together with their families are happy and
   prosperous.
Coordination of more than two items
4.67 More than two clauses, phrases or words can be
coordinated. The coordinator usually occurs once, before the
last two items. The most common coordinators are dan and
serta:
    Ini untuk hiasan dinding, meja serta kursi.
   These are decorations for walls, tables and chairs.
Alternatively, coordinators may occur between each item.
Rather than repetition of dan, the final two items are
frequently linked by serta: a dan b serta c 'a and b and e'.
This combination of coordinators may also occur if there is
coordination at two levels within the one construction. In the
following example dan links coordinate verbs while the object
consists of nouns joined by serta:
   Mereka menjaga dan memelihara kebersihan serta
   keteraturan sekolah mereka*
   They care for and maintain the cleanliness and orderliness
   of their school.
Atau 'or can also coordinate more than two items, usually
         1only occurring between the last two items. In the following
example atau links noun phrases, one of which contains two
nouns also linked by atau:
   bagi suami yang kehilangan istri, bagi anak yang
   kehilangan ibu atau bapak, atau bagi negara yang
   kehilangan raykatnya
   for husbands who have lost their wife, for children who
   have lost their mother or father, or for countries which
   have lost citizens
Coordination without a coordinator
4.68 Two units can be coordinated without a coordinator
being present; they are simply placed one after the other.
This is sometimes called parataxis. In the first example below
three clauses are linked in this way (dan being omitted); in
the second example two numbers are linked (atau being
omitted):
   Rumahku hancur, sapiku mati, sawahku tak bisa
   ditanami lagi.
   My house was destroyed, my cattle were dead, my fields
   could not be planted any more.
   Tiga empat ribu orang bekerja siang-malam di pabrik.
   Three or four thousand people work day and night in the
   factory.
Subordination
4.69 A sentence can consist of a main clause and a
subordinate clause. The main clause can stand alone as a
sentence (that is, it is an independent clause). The
subordinate clause cannot stand alone, occurring either before
or after the main clause to add information to it. The
subordinate clause is preceded by a subordinating
conjunction, sometimes called simply a conjunction. The
type of information given by the subordinate clause depends
on the conjunction. Some conjunctions also function as
prepositions, as discussed in section 2.127. In 4.70-9 the
main types of subordinate clause are discussed. Subordinate
clauses can occur without a subordinator, as discussed in
section 4.80. The verb in the main clause is referred to as the
main verb.
Clauses of time
4.70 These say something about when the action of the
main clause occurs. Time conjunctions include:
   sebelum before
   sesudah, setelah after
   sehabis after
   sejak since
   sampai until
   ketika, waktu, tatkala when
The words ketika, waktu and tatkala refer to a specific event
in the past:
    Ketika/waktu/tatkala mereka tiba di tanah seberang,
    keluarga Pak Idris dan para transmigran lain harus
    membuka hutan.
    When they arrived in the outer island Mr Idris's family and
   the other transmigrants had to clear the forest.
4.71 A special type of subordinate clause of time contains
the construction se- + verb + -nya. It indicates that the action
of the main clause occurs immediately after the action of the
subordinate clause. Only a limited number of verbs can
occur in this construction, all having to do with arrival, the
most common being setibanya 'on (someone's) arrival':
   Setibanya, dia langsung mandi.
   On arriving he immediately took a bath.
   Sepulangnya dari Jakarta, ibu jatuh sakit.
   On arriving home from Jakarta mother fell ill.
The subordinate clause can contain an agent:
  Sesampainya mereka di rumah sakit, mereka diperiksa
  dokter.
  On their arrival at the hospital they were examined by the
  doctor.
  Setibanya saya di sana, saya membuka kebun di
  belakang rumah.
  On my arrival there I made a garden at the back of the
  house.
Some people allow omission of -nya if the subordinate clause
has an agent:
   Sedatang beliau, kami boleh pergi.
   On his arrival we were allowed to go.
Clauses of condition
4.72 These indicate that the action of the main clause is
conditional in some way on occurrence of the action of the
subordinate clause. Conjunctions include:
   kalauJika, jikalau if, when
   bila, apabila, bilamana when, whenever, if
   asal, asalkan provided that
   seandainya, andaikata, sekiranya supposing that, if
While some of these words can refer to action in the past, and
thus be translated 'when\ they always indicate that the action
of the main clause has occurred or will occur more than once,
conditional on what is mentioned in the subordinate clause:
   Kalau Lebaran dia selalu pulang ke Jawa.
   When it's Lebaran he always returns to Java.
   Bila ada kesempatan, singgah di rumah saya.
   If/whenever you have a chance, drop in at my place.
When referring to future action English 'when' always carries
the assumption that the action of the subordinate clause will
occur, and so contrasts with 'if; the Indonesian words do not
convey an assumption that the action will occur:
  Malaysia bersedia mengurangi produksi minyak
  kalau/apabila negara-negara lain juga bersedia berbuat
  demikian.
  Malaysia is prepared to lower oil production if other
  countries are prepared to do the same.
The conjunctions andaikata, seandainya and sekiranya
often suppose something contrary to fact or something which
is unlikely to occur:
    Seandainya/andaikata/sekiranya musyafir itu kembali ia
    tetap tidak akan memperoleh air minum.
    Supposing/if that traveller returned he still wouldn't be
    given water to drink.
Clauses of reason
4.73 Subordinate clauses of reason indicate the reason for
the action of the main clause. Subordinators include:
   karena, oleh karena because
   sebab, oleh sebab because
   lantaran because
   gara-gara because
   mentang-mentang just because
   kalau-kalau lest
   Karena/sebab/lantaran sakit, dia tidak masuk sekolah.
   Because he was sick he didn't go to school.
   Mentang-mentang dia orang kaya, dia berbuat
   seenaknya.
   Just because he's a rich person he does as he likes.
The conjunction kalau-kalau 'lest' usually occurs with an
imperative main clause:
  Jangan lari, kalau-kalau jatuh.
  Don't run, lest you fall.
Clauses of purpose
4. 74 These indicate the purpose of the action of the main
clause. Conjunctions are:
   supaya, agar, agar supaya so, so that
   untuk, guna to, in order to
These also introduce complements (see 3.77-9 and 3.80-1),
which occur only with particular verbs and are obligatory to
the construction; subordinate clauses introduced by these
conjunctions can occur with any verb in the main clause and
are optional. The structure of the subordinate clauses is the
same as that of complement clauses. Supaya and agar are
followed by a full clause, whose subject is usually different
from the subject of the main clause; they correspond to finite
purpose clauses in English. If the subject is the same as that
of the main clause it can be ellipted (see 4.112 for an
example). Untuk and guna introduce a clause whose subject
is absent, being identical to the subject of the main verb; they
correspond to non-finite purpose clauses in English:
    Dia mencuci rambutnya supaya bersih.
   She washed her hair so that it was clean.
    Kami berangkat pagi-pagi agar kami tidak terlambat.
   We set off early in the morning so that we wouldn't be late.
   Saya harus pergi ke kantor pos untuk membeli
   perangko.
   I have to go to the post office to buy stamps.
   Mereka bertemu di Inggris guna membahas masalah-
   masalah itu.
   They met in England to discuss those matters.
While a complement always follows the main verb a
subordinate clause introduced by supaya or agar can
precede the main clause:
   Agar kami tidak terlambat kami berangkat pagi-pagi.
   So that we wouldn't be late we set off early in the morning.
Clauses of extent
4.75 These indicate that the action of the main clause
continues to the extent that the action of the subordinate
clause results. Conjunctions include:
   sehingga, sampai, hingga until, to the extent that, so that
   Zainab memandangi mukaku, hingga aku jadi marah.
   Zainab stared at my face until/so that I became angry.
   Pencuri itu dikejar, sampai/sehingga/hingga dia
   ditangkap.
   The thief was chased until he was caught.
These conjunctions can occur in correlative constructions,
with begitu, demikian or sedemikian occurring in the first
clause (see 4.88).
Clauses of concession
4.76 These clauses, often called concessive clauses,
indicate that the action or state expressed in the main clause
occurs despite what is stated in the subordinate clause.
Subordinators, all of which can be translated 'although ,   1include:
   meski, meskipun
   walau, walaupun
   sekalipun
   kendati, kendatipun
   biarpun
   sungguhpun
   Meskipun/walaupun dia amat cape, dia memasak untuk
   suaminya.
   Although she was extremely tired she cooked for her
   husband.
Reduplicated adjectives can also carry a concessive meaning
(see 1.17).
These conjunctions also introduce clauses in correlative
relationship with clauses preceded by namun, as discussed in
section 4.91.
The conjunction padahal 'whereas, although' introduces a
clause which states something factual which contrasts with
what is stated in the main clause:
   Dia pura-pura tidak tahu, padahal dia tahu banyak.
   He pretended not to know, whereas he knew a great deal.
Clauses of means and manner
4.77 Conjunction dengan 'by, by means of indicates the
means by which or the manner in which an action is
perfomed:
   Pencuri memasuki rumah dengan memecahkan kaca
   jendela.
   The thief entered the house by breaking a window.
  Dengan bekerja keras kamu pasti akan lulus.
  By working hard you will certainly pass.
Conjunction tanpa 'without' indicates a means or manner by
which an action is not achieved:
  Dia meninggalkan isterinya tanpa memikirkan nasib
  anaknya.
  He left his wife without thinking of the fate of his children.
Clauses of resemblance
4.78 These indicate that the action of the main clause is
done in the way it would be done if what is stated in the
subordinate clause were the case. Conjunctions are:
   seakan-akan, seolah-olah as if
   Abdullah berbicara tentang kebaikan Lord Minto
   seakan-akan orang Inggris itu layak disembah-sembah.
   Abdullah spoke of the kindness of Lord Minto as if the
   Englishman was fit to be worshipped.
   Dia takut kepada saya seolah-olah saya ini musuhnya.
   He's afraid of me as if I were his enemy.
Clauses of contrast
4.79 These contrast what is said in the main clause with
something else. Conjunctions are:
   daripada rather than, instead of
   alih-alih rather than, instead of
   melainkan, tetapi but rather, instead
   Saya akan bertransmigrasi ke Irian Jaya daripada
   menjadi gelandangan.
   I will transmigrate to Irian Jaya rather than become a
   vagrant.
   Alih-alih naik kereta api, ia memilih naik pesawat
   terbang.
   Instead of taking a train he chose to go by plane.
   Mereka tak menyerang tubuh seenaknya, melainkan
   memilih sasaran tertentu.
   They don't attack the body in a random way but rather
   choose specific targets.
Conjunction daripada can introduce a clause in correlative
relationship with a clause introduced by lebih baik or
sebaiknya, as discussed in section 4.92.
Constructions with melainkan/tetapi are further discussed in
sections 4.84-6.
Subordinate clauses without a subordinator
4.80 Subordinate clauses without a subordinator
correspond to non-finite clauses in English. The subordinate
clause has no subject, the action being performed by the same
person in both clauses.
The subordinate clause can occur before the main clause. In
this case the action of the main clause occurs immediately
after the action of the subordinate clause. In some cases the
subordinate clause also indicates the reason for the action of
the main clause:
   Melihat aku gugup, Zainab jadi reda.
    Seeing me nervous, Zainab calmed down.
    Mendengar cerita Narti, Totok berkata di dalam hati,
    tt
    Hearing Narti's story, Totok thought to himself, ""...
   Berhasil melarikan diri, ia pun mengembara di Eropah.
   Managing to escape, he then wandered about in Europe.
The subordinate clause can follow the main clause. In this
case the events in the two clauses occur at the same time. The
subordinate clause sometimes expresses the reason for the
action of the main clause:
   Hakim mengetukkan palu, menutup sidang.
   The judge beat his gavel, closing the session.
   Pak Karim mendayung, menyeberangkan Muji kembali
   ke desanya.
   Mr Karim rowed, taking Muji back across to his village.
   Ia duduk di kursi, mengayun-ayunkan kakinya.
   He sat on the chair, swinging his legs.
Correlative Structures
4.81 Sometimes two clauses, phrases or words are
dependent on each other, such that neither can occur alone.
The two units are correlative constructions or are said to have
a correlative relationship. Usually each of the units is
introduced by a conjunction or adverb, as discussed in
sections 4.82-97.
Baik... maupun !both... and'
4.82 Emphasis can be placed on the fact that what is said
applies to two words or phrases in coordination by placing
baik before the first and maupun before the second. These
words are a correlative pair because baik anticipates the
addition of what follows maupun:
   Baik Ana maupun Ira tinggal di Jakarta.
   Both Ana and Ira live in Jakarta.
   Baik di kota maupun di desa sepak bola digemari orang.
   Soccer is enjoyed both in the town and in the village.
If the accompanying predicate is negated the construction
means 'neither ... nor':
   Baik kepandaian maupun kecantikan tidak berguna
   untuk mencapai kebahagiaan.
   Neither ability nor beauty is useful for achieving
   happiness.
The word baik is sometimes omitted:
  Mereka berjuang untuk bangsa maupun untuk keluarga.
  They fight both for the nation and for their family.
If more than two items occur in coordination baik is placed
before the first and maupun before the last:
    Baik orang Cina, orang Jepang, orang India maupun
  ' orang Portugis berdagang di Jakarta.
    Chinese, Japanese, and Indians, as well as Portuguese
    traded in Jakarta.
Correlative structures with bukan
4.83 There are several correlative structures in which the
first unit is preceded by bukan 'not'. These are discussed in
sections 4.84-7.
Bukan... melainkan/tetapi 'hot... but rather'
4.84 These constructions contain two clauses. The first,
introduced by bukan, is stated to be incorrect, while instead
the second, introduced by melainkan or tetapi, is stated to be
true. Bukan does not occur within the first clause but rather
negates the whole clause; a negative can occur within the
clause predicate, as in the second example below. Bukan
usually occurs before the subject of the clause and can
optionally take -nya:
   Bukan dia bodoh, melainkan dia malas.
   It's not that he's stupid, but rather that he's lazy.
   Bukannya saya tidak mau membeli rumah, tetapi uang
   saya tidak cukup.
   It's not that I don't want to buy a house, but that I don't
   have enough money.
The two clauses can have the same subject, expressed before
the first clause. In this case bukan can follow the subject:
   Ia bukannya memerankan si Doel, melainkan menjadi
   sutradara.
   He isn't playing the part of Doel, but rather is the director.
In some cases the second clause is so clearly implied by the
first clause that it can be omitted:
    Saya bukan tidak percaya kepadamu.
    I don't disbelieve you.
If bukan occurs after the subject and is not followed by -nya
or tidak, it can be regarded as occurring within the predicate
of the clause. If it occurs with other than a noun predicate it
is emphatic, anticipating the contradictory clause to follow
(see 2.137):
    Dia bukan bodoh, melainkan malas saja.
    He's not stupid but just lazy.
If emphasis is absent bukan can be replaced by tidak; the first
clause is then simply a basic clause, followed by a subordinate
clause introduced by melainkan or tetapi (see also 4.79):
    Kami tidak pergi ke Solo, melainkan ke Yogya.
    We didn't go to Solo but to Yogya.
Correlative subordinate clauses of purpose
4.85 A sentence can state that an action is performed not
for one purpose but for another. In this case correlative
subordinate clauses of purpose introduced by untuk (see also
4.74) occur. In English 'not usually occurs before the verb
                              1of the main clause rather than before the first subordinate
clause. In Indonesian bukan occurs before the verb of the
first subordinate clause:
    Dia pergi ke Indonesia bukan untuk tinggal di hotel
    tetapi untuk bergaul dengan rakyat.
    He didn't go to Indonesia to stay in a hotel but to mix with
    the people.
Bukan hanya... melainkan/tetapi juga 'not only... but
also'
4.86 The correlative structure may indicate that not only
does the action of the first clause occur but so too does the
action of the second clause. The first clause contains bukan
h a n y a 'not only' and the second is introduced by
tetapi/melainkan juga 'but also'. Extra emphasis can be given
to hanya, occurring before the predicate of the first clause, by
placing saja after the predicate:
    Candi Borobudur bukan hanya sebuah monumen
    bersejarah saja, tetapi juga ramai didatangi orang.
    The Borobudur temple is not just a historical monument
    but it is also visited by many people.
Other correlative structures with bukan
4.87 The second clause can be introduced by several
other words, including asal(kan) 'provided that', which sets a
condition on the occurrence of the action of the first clause:
   Saya bukan tidak rela kau membantu familimu, asal kau
   pertimbangkan juga kebutuhan kita sendiri.
   I'm not unwilling for you to help your relatives, provided
   you also consider our own needs.
Begitu/(se)demikian... sehingga/sampai'so... (to the
extent) that'
4.88 Subordinate clauses of extent are discussed in
section 4.75. If the main clause is an adjective clause the
sentence can indicate that the action or state of the
subordinate clause is a result of the extent of the quality
mentioned in the main clause. The main clause contains
begitu, demikian or sedemikian, which are actually
modifying adverbs within the adjective phrase (see 2.100):
   Dia begitu gembira, sehingga dia menangis.
   He was so happy that he cried.
   Harganya sedemikian mahal, sehingga tidak ada yang
   mau beli.
   The price was so expensive that no one wanted to buy it.
   Dia demikian lelah, sampai tidak dapat berjalan lagi.
   She was so tired that she couldn't walk any further.
If preceded by demikian or sedemikian, the adjective can
take -nya. Some people regard -nya as obligatory in this
situation:
    Udara sedemikian panasnya, sampai banyak orang
    pingsan.
   The air was so hot that many people fainted.
Instead of being the predicate of an adjective clause, the
adjective phrase may function as an adverb of manner in the
first clause:
    Dia lari begitu cepat sehingga sangat sukar untuk
    memotretnya.
    She was running so fast that it was very difficult to
    photograph her.
Instead of an adjective, rupa can occur, the phrase
begitu/demikian rupa meaning 'in such a way':
   Haji itu membentak aku begitu rupa hingga mukanya
   menimbulkan rasa jijikku.
   The haji snapped at me in such a way that his face aroused
   my disgust.
Correlative structures with begitu 'no sooner... than'
4.89 In these constructions the first clause is introduced
by begitu 'no sooner'. The second clause, which has no
formal marker, refers to an action which immediately follows
on the action of the first clause. In English the second clause
begins with 'than':
   Begitu timbul penyakit baru, segera juga ditemukan
   obatnya.
   No sooner does a new illness appear than a medicine is
   discovered for it.
   Begitu musim hujan tiba, jalan itu tertutup air.
   No sooner does the wet season arrive than those roads are
   covered in water.
A few reduplicated intransitive verbs can function in the same
way as begitu in this construction (see 1.24).
Correlative structures with modifying adverbs like makin...
makin'the more... the more'
4.90 Two adjective clauses (see 3.9) can occur in a
correlative relationship to indicate that as the degree of the
first adjective increases so too does the degree of the second.
Each adjective is preceded by one of the modifying adverbs
makin, semakin, kian, tambah, bertambah 'increasingly* (see
2.100). Both clauses can have the same subject:
    Ali makin besar makin sombong.
    The older Ali gets the more arrogant he becomes.
    Orang itu tambah tua tambah kaya.
    The older that person gets the richer he becomes.
The first clause can contain lama 'long (of time)'. Such
constructions indicate that the degree of the adjective in the
second clause increases as time goes on. The construction is
similar in meaning to a single clause having the same
adjective, except that the correlative construction puts
emphasis on the gradual intensity in the quality over time.
The first example below is preceded by a single clause
containing the same adjective:
    Ali makin kurus.
  . Ali is getting thinner.
    Ali makin lama makin kurus.
    (As time goes on) Ali is getting thinner and thinner.
    Harga barang semakin lama semakin tinggi.
    The price of goods is continually rising.
Hari 'day' can replace lama, in this construction also meaning
'long (of time)':
    Golongan itu bertambah hari bertambah kuat.
   That group is getting stronger and stronger (as time goes
   on).
The two clauses can have different subjects; each subject
usually occurs after its predicate:
   Makin tinggi pangkat orang, makin banyak persoalan
   yang dihadapinya.
   The higher the position of a person, the more problems he
   faces.
   Kian berat penderitaan orang, kian dekat ia pada
   Tuhan.
   The greater a person's suffering, the closer he comes to
   God.
The correlative relationship may be between adverbs of
manner or other adjuncts within two clauses, rather than
between predicates. The adverb occurs first in each clause:
   Makin sering mereka bertemu, makin sering mereka
   bertengkar.
   The more frequently they meet the more frequently they
   quarrel.
   Makin lama orang tinggal di kota besar, makin enggan
   mereka kembali ke desa.
   The longer people live in a big city the more reluctant they
   are to return to the village.
Meskipun... namun although... nevertheless'and related
                       1
structures
4.91 Meskipun 'although' and similar words introduce
subordinate clauses of concession (see 4.76). Instead of
occurring with a main clause they can occur in correlative
relationship with a clause beginning with n a m u n
'nevertheless'. This emphasises the contrast between what is
stated in the two clauses. The clause with meskipun must
come first:
   Meskipun sawahnya banyak, namun kenikmatan hidup
   sedikit.
   Although he has many rice fields, nevertheless the
   pleasures of life are few.
The other subordinators of concession listed in 4.76 can also
occur, such as biarpun:
   Biarpun sumbangannya tidak seberapa, namun dia
   mempunyai peranan dalam proyek raksasa ini.
   Although his contribution doesn't amount to much,
   nevertheless he has a role in this giant project.
Instead of namun, the second clause can begin with toh
'nevertheless', or contain juga 'anyway' after the predicate. All
three can occur together, which gives especially strong
emphasis to the contrast between the two clauses:
   Meski keterangan Suryaman seru, toh terasa kurang
   meyakinkan.
   Although Suryaman's explanation was loud, it was
   nevertheless unconvincing.
   Meskipun hujan lebat, si Amat pergi juga.
   Although it was raining heavily, Amat went anyway.
   Meskipun sakit, namun anak-anak ini toh sekolah juga.
   Despite being sick, nevertheless these children go to school
   anyway.
Closely related in meaning are constructions in which the first
clause does not begin with a conjunction, while the second
clause ends with juga. These indicate that the action of the
second clause occurs despite what is mentioned in the first
clause. The second clause frequently begins with tetapi 'but':
   Dia tidak diundang, tetapi dia datang juga.
   He wasn't invited but he came anyway.
Lebih baik/sebaiknya... daripada It's better that... rather
than'
4.92 A contrast of the type 'it's better that ... rather than'
can occur between two clauses. Either clause can occur first.
The clause beginning with lebih baik/sebaiknya frequently
also contains saja 'just', which emphasises the contrast between
the two clauses:
   Daripada mati kelaparan, lebih baik kita pindah saja.
   Rather than die of hunger it's better that we move.
   Sebaiknya mereka menyerah saja, daripada melawan.
   It's better that they just surrender rather than fight.
                                                    namun/toh
'no matter how [adjective]... nevertheless
4.93 These constructions indicate that no matter how
much of a certain quality there is, nevertheless a certain action
or state will occur. The quality is expressed in the first clause,
which is an adjective clause; -nya is attached to the adjective.
The second clause is introduced by n a m u n or toh
'nevertheless :
             1   Betapapun baiknya orang Eropah itu pada kita, toh
   mereka takut mengambil risiko.
   No matter how kind those Europeans are to us,
   nevertheless they will be afraid to take risks.
Namun may be absent from the second clause:
  Bagaimanapun terbukanya pemikiran Nurcholish, di
  kalangan kebanyakan umat pemikiran itu agak susah
  diterima.
  No matter how open Nurcholish's thinking is, among most
  congregations that thinking is rather hard to accept.
Bagaimanapun can also link the following clause with the
preceding sentence (see 4.100).
Correlative structures with baru hot until'
                                    14.94 Baru occurs in a sentence containing a subordinate
clause of time (see 4.70) or within a clause containing an
adjunct of time (see 2.182ff) to indicate that the action of the
main verb does not occur until the time of the action of the
subordinate clause or the time mentioned in the adjunct.
Baru can precede either the time element or the main clause:
   Baru setelah keluar dari desa ketiga tokoh kita dapat
   naik dokar.
   Not until they were out of the village could our three
   characters get in the carriage.
   Baru pukul sepuluh berita itu diketahui.
   Not until ten o'clock was the news known.
   Sore hari, sehabis bekerja, baru kita pulang.
   Not until evening, after finishing work, do we go home.
   Malam harinya baru aku pergi ke Hotel Homan.
   Not until night time did I go to the Hotel Homan.
Entah... entah 'whether... or'
4.95 This construction indicates that something occurs
whether it is the result of one thing or another. The structure
frequently consists of two clauses, each preceded by entah,
stating the alternative causes, and followed by a third clause
stating the effect. Ellipsis of some clause elements (see
4.111) in the clauses preceded by entah is usual:
   Entah dia bodoh entah malas, dia tidak pernah
   menyelesaikan pekerjaannya.
   Whether he's stupid or lazy, he never finishes his work.
   Entah disetujui entah tidak, dia tetap akan mengusulkan
   gagasannya.
   Whether it's agreed to or not he will continue to propose
   his idea.
The clause stating the effect may occur first:
  Kalau mati secara alami biasanya monyet ini tidak
  ditemukan, entah dikubur oleh monyet lainnya, entah
  kebiasaan monyet itu menyembunyikan diri sebelum
  mati.
  If they die of natural causes these monkeys are usually not
  found, whether because they are buried by other monkeys
  or because it is their habit to hide themselves before dying.
Kalau/apabila... maka !if... then'
4.96 Kalau and apabila 'if introduce a subordinate
clause of condition (see 4.72). Instead of occurring in a
sentence with an independent clause this can cooccur with a
clause beginning with m a k a 'then', which states a
consequence:
   Apabila pemerintah Sri Langka tidak mengambil
   langkah tegas, maka India akan protes.
   If the Sri Langkan government does not take firm steps
 ' then India will protest.
   Kalau teori ini benar, maka jawaban itu harus kita
   pertimbangkan lagi.
   If this theory is correct then we must rethink the answer.
Jangankan... pun 'not only... even1
4.97 This construction indicates that not only does the
action indicated by the verb apply to the first phrase, which is
surprising enough, but it even applies to the second phrase:
   Jangankan orang lain, orang tuanya sendiri pun tidak
   dihormati.
   Not only other people, but even his parents he doesn't
   respect.
   Jangankan rumah, kamar pun belum punya.
   He doesn't even have a room yet, much less a house.
   Jangankan Ida Betara, saya pun risi kalau melihat
   jemuran di depan pura.
   Let alone Ida Betara, even I would be disgusted to see
   laundry (hanging up) in front of the temple.","[365, 366, 367, 368, 369, 370, 371, 372, 373, 374, 375, 376, 377, 378, 379, 380, 381, 382, 383, 384, 385]"
"Nominalised clauses
3.130 The word 'nominalised means 'turned/made into a
                                  1noun . Nominalisation can apply not only to clauses but to
     1various words, including adjectives (see 2.35). Relative
clauses (see 3.97) can be nominalised by deletion of the head
of the noun phrase, as discussed in 3.131. A clauses can also
be nominalised by use of -nya on the predicate; this is called
predicate nominalisation, and is discussed in section 3.136.
Some clauses can be nominalised by occurring in certain
positions within another clause; these are simple nominal
clauses, discussed in section 3.143. Indirect questions are also
nominalised constructions; these are discussed in section 4.27.
Nominalised relative clauses
3.131 Relative clauses occur within noun phrases and are
preceded by yang (see 3.97).
Nominalisation occurs when the head noun is ellipted (see
4.111), usually because it is clear from context, leaving yang
at the beginning of the noun phrase. The yang phrase then
functions like a noun. In corresponding constructions in
English the noun is frequently replace by 'one . The noun
                                                   1mobil 'car' in the first clause below is omitted in the second
clause because it is clear from the context what sort of thing is
b§ing spoken about:
   Mobil yang dibeli Ali berwarna biru. Yang dibeli
   Hasan berwarna merah.
   The car which Ali bought is blue. The one Hasan bought
   is red.
3.132 Any defining relative clause (see 3.98) can be
nominalised by deletion of the head noun. The following
examples illustrate a number of different types of
nominalised relative clauses:
  Yang biru milik saya.
  The blue one is mine.
  Yang sudah dipakai tidak bisa dikembalikan.
  The used ones can't be returned.
  Kepada yang lapar diberikan makanan.
  To the hungry will be given food,
  yang itu
  that one
  yang mengajukan permohonan ini
  the one who presented this request
  yang kedua
  the second one
  yang lain
  the other; others
3.133 Possessor topic-comment relative clauses (see 3.104)
and prepositional relative clauses (see 3.106) can also be
nominalised:
   Yang mobilnya dicuri langsung memberitahu polisi.
   The one whose car was stolen told the police straightaway.
   Yang di depannya tumbuh pohon mangga rumah
   Hendrik.
   the one in front of which grows a mango tree is Hendrik's
   house.
Object topic-comment clauses (see 3.105) are unlikely to be
nominalised because of their complex structure.
3.134 A nominalised relative clause can occur in any of the
positions in which the embedding phrase can occur, including
subject, predicate and object, as in the following examples:
   Yang itu teman saya.
   That one is my friend.
   Mobil saya yang biru.
   My car is the blue one.
   Andi memilih yang besar.
   Andi chose the big one.
Since the nominalised clause is a noun it is negated by bukan
if it appears in the predicate:
    Mobil saya bukan yang biru.
    My car isn't the blue one.
However, the predicate within the nominalised clause can also
be negated and if this is a verb it is negated by tidak in the
usual way:
   Mobil saya yang tidak biru.
   My car is the one which isn't blue.
3.135 It is stated in section 3.99 that the verb in a relative
clause must be passive if the head noun stands as object to it.
This rule holds in a nominalised relative clause, even though
the head noun is deleted:
   Yang dibangun Pak Dani tidak begitu besar.
   The one Mr Dani built isn't very big.
Predicate nominalisation
3.136 A predicate which contains a verb or an adjective can
be nominalised by the suffixation of -nya. The subject of the
clause becomes a possessor in the nominalised construction.
The process is illustrated with the following clause:
  Beberapa jalan ditutup.
  Several roads were closed.
(i)        The verb is placed before the subject and -nya is
attached to it; the subject now acts as possessor to the
nominalised verb:
    ditutupnya beberapa jalan
    the closure of several roads
(ii)        The whole construction is now a noun phrase, which
can occur in a larger construction, italicised in the following
example:
     Lalu lintas menjadi macet karena ditutupnya beberapa
   jalan.
     Traffic became jammed because of the closure of several
     roads.
A second illustrative example is the following:
  Yang amat menyolok adalah hadirnya anak-anak kecil
  di setiap tempat yang kita lalui.
  What was very conspicuous was the presence of small
  children in every place we passed through.
The nominalised clause in the above is hadirnya anak-anak
kecil 'the presence of small children', which derives from the
clause Anak-anak kecil hadir 'Small children are present'.
The nominalised predicate can be an adjective, as in the first
two examples below, an intransitive verb, as in the third to
fifth examples, or a transitive verb. If transitive it must be
passive, as in the last two examples below. The basic clause
from which the nominalised clause derives is placed in
parentheses after each example below:
    Hal ini disebabkan karena miskinnya orang tua. [Orang
    tua miskin.]
    This is caused by the poverty of parents.
    Mereka harus menghadapi ganasnya laut selama
    berminggu-minggu. [Laut ganas.]
   They had to face the fury of the sea for weeks.
    Mereka prihatin atas terjadinya kerusuhan di kampus.
    [Kerusuhan terjadi di kampus.]
    They are concerned about the occurrence of riots on the
   campus.
    Runtuhnya komunisme Soviet merugikan ekonomi
    Kuba. [Komunisme Soviet runtuh.]
   The collapse of Soviet communism damaged the Cuban
   economy.
   Sungguh luar biasa meningkatnya jumlah anak-anak di
   negeri kita ini. [Jumlah anak-anak di negeri kita ini
   meningkat.]
   The increase in the number of children in this land of ours
   is truly extraordinary.
   Polisi telah menahan dua orang pria sehubungan
   dengan terbunuhnya seorang anggota parlemen.
    [Seorang anggota parlemen terbunuh.]
   Police have detained two males in connection with the
   killing of a member of parliament.
   Para demonstran menuntut dibebaskannya semua buruh
   yang ditahan. [Semua buruh yang ditahan dibebaskan.]
   The demonstrators demanded the freeing of all the
   detained workers.
3.137 In the examples in 3.136 the nominalised predicate
is a single word. However, the predicate can contain any of
the constituents discussed in sections 2.133-53:
   Ini menunjukkan tidak adanya efisiensi kerja.
   This indicates lack (non-existence) of work efficiency.
   Sebuah suara yang menggeletar mengumumkan akan
   datangnya seorang jenderal yang kelak menguasai
   dunia.
   A shimmering voice announced the future coming of a
   general who would rule the world.
   Mereka tidak sadar tentang bakal adanya pemilihan
   umum.
   They aren't aware of the forthcoming general elections.
If the nominalised predicate is adjectival it can include
modifying adverbs occurring within the adjective phrase (see
2.100):
   Ini menunjukkan makin baiknya hubungan bilateral.
   This indicates the increasing improvement in bilateral
   relations.
3.138 Nominalised adjectives and verbs can often be
replaced by nouns with affixation ke-...-an (see 1.72) or peN-
...-an (see 1.87). The following are drawn from examples in
section 3.136 with corresponding nouns in parentheses:
    miskinnya (kemiskinan) orang tua
    the poverty of the parents
    hadirnya (kehadiran) anak-anak kecil
    the presence of small children
    meningkatnya (peningkatan) jumlah anak-anak
    the increase in the number of children
    terbunuhnya (pembunuhan) seorang anggota parlemen
    the killing of a member of parliament
Where there are both intransitive and transitive verbs with the
same base, a corresponding peN-...-an noun does not
distinguish between them (see 1.89); however, the
nominalised predicate does: mendaratnya/pendaratan
pasukan itu 'the landing of those troops' (from: Pasukan itu
mendarat 'Those troops landed') and didaratkannya/
pendaratan pasukan itu 'the landing of those troops' (from:
Pasukan itu didaratkan Those troops were landed').
Not all nominalised verbs and adjectives can be replaced by
ke-...-an or peN-...-an nouns. In particular, if the
nominalisation involves other predicate components, such as
tidak adanya 'non-existence' and akan datangnya 'future
coming', as in examples in section 3.137, this is not possible.
Also, a few nominalised forms have different meanings from
affixed forms with the same base. Thus banyaknya orang
'the large number of people' and kebanyakan orang 'the
majority of people'.
3.139 A nominalised predicate can consist of two words in
contrast. The pair can be two adjectives, such as besar-
kecilnya 'size, dimensions', two intransitive verbs, such as
timbul-tenggelamnya 'rise and fall', or an adjective or
intransitive verb and tidak, such as ada-tidaknya 'existence or
not':
    Besar-kecilnya rumah itu tidak diberitahukan.
    The size (largeness or smallness) of the house was not
    reported.
   Timbul-tenggelamnya suata negara tidak bergantung
    pada cara pemerintahannya.
   The rise and fall of a nation does not depend on its type of
   government.
   Pembebasan suatu negara tergantung pada ada-
   tidaknya kegiatan politik.
   The liberation of a country depends on the existence or
   otherwise of political activity.
Such constructions do not derive directly from independent
clauses. However, many of them can be related to
constructions in which predicates are coordinated by atau
(see 4.64), which is sometimes retained in the nominalised
form. The nominalised structure in the following example
derives from a clause with coordinated predicates, Usaha ini
berhasil atau tidak berhasil This endeavour succeeds or does
not succeed':
   Berhasil-tidaknya/berhasil atau tidaknya usaha ini
   tergantung pada kita.
   The success or failure of this endeavour depends on us.
3.140 Nominalisation of adjectives referring to measure is
a particular type of predicate nominalisation. Adjectives of
measure are nominalised as explained in section 3.136. Thus
from Orang itu tinggi That person is tall', is derived
tingginya orang itu 'the height of that person'. Such
constructions frequently occur as subjects of quantity clauses
(see 3.8):
   Tingginya orang itu seratus tujuh puluh sentimeter.
   That person's height is one hundred and seventy
   centimetres.
Nominalised adjectives of measure only take - n y a
obligatorily if there is no other possessor expressed, In the
presence of a first or second person possessor -nya cannot
occur:
   Beratnya sepuluh kilo.
   Its weight is ten kilos.
   Berat(nya) koper ini sepuluh kilo.
   The weight of this suitcase is ten kilos.
   Berat saya delapan puluh kilo.
   My weight is eighty kilos.
3.141 Nominalised measure adjective constructions
frequently become topic-comment clauses (see 3.88):
   Roket itu panjangnya 7,9 meter dan beratnya 2.180 kg.
   The length of the rocket is 7.9 metres and its weight is
   2,180 kg.
3.142 A nominalised adjective of measure cannot be used
if the construction does not contain a possessor. Instead a ke-
...-an noun (see 1.72) is used:
    Roket itu mampu mencapai ketinggian 50 mil dan
    mencapai kecepatan 2.500 mil per jam.
    The rocket can achieve a height of 50 miles and a speed of
    2,500 miles per hour.
Ke-...-an nouns are sometimes used instead of nominalised
measure adjectives even where there is a possessor (see also
3.138). The nouns kedalaman 'depth' and kecepatan 'speed'
frequently occur in such contexts:
   Kedalaman/dalamnya sungai ini tiga meter.
   The depth of this river is three metres.
   Kecepatan/cepatnya mobil itu seratus kilometer per jam.
   The speed of the car was one hundred kilometres per hour.
However, the two forms sometimes differ. Thus ketinggian
'height' refers to how far above the ground something is:
ketinggian pesawat itu 'the height of that plane (i.e. how high
it is flying)', while tingginya 'height, tallness' refers to the
measurement of something from its base to top.
Simple nominal clauses
3.143 Intransitive verbs and transitive active verbs can be
used as nouns meaning 'the general activity denoted by the
verb'. In grammars of English these are usually called
gerunds, verbal nouns or nominal '-ing' clauses. They can
occur as subject of a clause:
   Berenang sangat baik untuk kesehatan.
   Swimming is very good for the health.
   Mengarang ialah seni.
   Writing is an art.
While a verb is often nominalised alone, as in the above
examples, other clause elements can occur with it. However,
because the nominalised verb refers to activity in a general
way it cannot have a subject. An object can occur, although
this cannot be a definite noun:
    Mencari pekerjaan di kota tidak begitu mudah.
    Finding work in the city is not very easy.
    Mengumpulkan perangko kesukaannya.
    Collecting stamps is his hobby.
    Membersihkan rumah tidak boleh dilalaikan.
   Cleaning the house cannot be neglected.
Besides components of the original clause nothing can occur
within the noun phrase with a nominal clause except the
demonstrative itu, which occurs when all instances of the
action are referred to; it also has the effect of identifying the
verb as nominal (see 2.7):
   Lari itu sehat.
   Running is healthy.
As mentioned in section 3.115, deletion of untuk results in a
simple nominal clause, although not all simple nominal
clauses can become untuk clauses.
3.144 In all the examples in section 3.143 simple nominal
clauses occur in subject position. A simple nominal clause
can also occur as predicate, in which case it is usually
preceded by copula adalah or ialah (see also the first
example in 3.6):
   Tugas saya adalah menjual koran.
   My task is selling newspapers.
   Kesenangan kami ialah bermain sepak bola.
   Our favourite pastime is playing soccer.
That the verb is here acting as a noun is shown by the fact that
the predicate is equated with the subject and is negated by
bukan. When the predicate is negated a copula rarely occurs:
   Kegemaran saya bukan memelihara binatang.
   My hobby is not looking after animals.
3.145 Secondary verbs of the type jahit-menjahit
'everything to do with sewing' are always nominalised; these
are discussed in section 1.252.
4 SENTENCES
4.1       A sentence is a construction which is grammatically
complete; it can stand alone as a complete utterance (although
it may be closely linked to what has gone before). A sentence
expresses a statement, question, command, or exclamation. In
writing a sentence begins with a capital letter and ends with a
full stop, question mark, or exclamation mark.
In this chapter the different types of sentence structure are
described. In sections 4.2-62 are described the four moods:
statements, questions, imperatives, exclamations.
Sentences are either simple or complex. A simple sentence
consists of a single independent clause (clauses are described
in Chapter Three). A complex sentence is one which consists
of more than a single clause. Complex sentences are
described in sections 4.63-110.
Ellipsis, or omission of clause components, is discussed in
sections 4.111-8.","[328, 329, 330, 331, 332, 333, 334, 335, 336, 337]"
"ADJUNCTS
2.165 Adjuncts are components of a clause which give
information about such matters as place, time, frequency, and
manner. Adjuncts may be single words, prepositional phrases
(see 2.118ff) or other phrase types. Adjuncts are often called
adverbs or adverbials, although here the word adverb is
restricted to adjuncts of manner.
There is a great variety of adjuncts of which only the most
frequent can be dealt with in the following sections. In
addition to adjuncts which give information which applies to
the clause in general there are other adjuncts, called focusing
adjuncts, which focus on a particular element in the clause.
These are discussed in sections 2.216-26.
Adverbs
2.166 Adverbs are a subgroup of adjuncts which give
information about the manner in which an action is
performed. They are sometimes called adverbs of manner.
Many adverbs are based on adjectives and are usually
translated by an adjective with suffix -ly in English. There are
several ways in which adverbs are derived from adjectives, as
described in the following sections. Some adverbs are not
based on adjectives and these are also described below.
Where the derivation involves affixation adverbs are described
in Chapter One (see 1.136 and 1.142).
Adjectives used directly as adverbs
2.167 A few adjectives can be used directly as adverbs
without a preposition or reduplication:
   Kami bekerja keras.
   We work hard.
   Mereka akan mudah mencari pekerjaan.
   They will get work easily.
Adverbs formed with dengan
2.168 Many adverbs of manner are phrases consisting of
dengan followed by an adjective or adjective phrase:
   Edberg melompati net dengan gembira setelah
   mengalahkan Sampras.
   Edberg jumped the net with glee after defeating Sampras.
   Jumlah penduduk di kota Jakarta menanjak dengan
   cepat sekali.
   Jakarta's population is rising very quickly.
   Amerika dengan tegas mengingatkan dunia akan
   kemampuannya.
   America forcefully reminded the world of its strength.
While many adjectives can be adverbialised by placing
dengan before them a few cannot, including aneh 'strange',
benar 'true', bodoh 'stupid', lucu 'funny'. However, there is
considerable variation between what different people regard
as acceptable.
The suffix -nya can optionally occur on the adjective:
  Hujan turun dengan derasnya.
   The rain fell heavily.
Adverbs formed with secara
2.169 Some adjectives can be adverbialised by placing
secara before them:
   Mereka hidup secara sederhana.
   They live simply.
   Topeng dapat dibuat secara mudah.
   Masks can be made easily.
   Dia tidak mengatakan pemikirannya dan sikapnya
   secara jujur.
   He did not state his thinking and attitude honestly.
Adverbs formed with secara are not based solely on
adjectives. They can be based on verbs acting adjectivally, as
discussed in section 2.98, and also on some verbs which do
not act as adjectivcs, and on other word classes:
   Manusia hidup berdampingan dengan serangga secara
   menguntungkan.
   Humans live side by side with insects profitably.
   Mereka mengundang penelitian ilmiah secara terbuka.
   They openly invite scientific inspection.
   Plaza ini secara berkala digunakan untuk maksud-
   maksud komersial.
   This plaza is used periodically for commercial purposes.
   Kasus itu diusut secara hukum.
   The case was investigated legally.
   Secara pribadi Moerdiono ikut protes.
   Privately Moerdiono joined the protest.
The adjective following secara can be negated:
  Pernyataan itu secara tidak langsung mengesampingkan
  anggota PLO.
  The statement indirectly ignores the PLO members.
  Dia dituduh bergaul secara tidak senonoh dengan wanita
  itu.
  He was accused of associating immorally with the woman.
Reduplicated adjectives
2.170 Some adverbs consist of reduplicated adjectives:
   Habiskan nasimu cepat-cepat!
   Finish your rice quickly!
   Kakinya diikat erat-erat
   His feet were bound tightly.
   Penyakit itu betul-betul dapat disembuhkan»
   The disease can really be cured.
   Dia diam-diam meninggalkan istana.
   He quietly left the palace.
2.171 Some adverbs can be derived from adjectives either
by use of dengan or reduplication, although their number is
limited:
   Sofyan berteriak keras-keras/dengan keras.
   Sofyan screamed loudly.
Other adverbs
2.172 A small group of adverbs consist of a negative
followed by reduplicated adjective base plus -nya. These
indicate that the quality or state specified by the reduplicated
form is never reached, often translating 'without ever getting
[base] . The following examples are based on putus 'broken,
      1interrupted', jemu 'tired' and jera 'wary, having learned one's
lesson' respectively:
   Dengan mereka raja tak putus-putusnya bercanda.
   With them the king incessantly cracked jokes.
   Dia bekerja tidak jemu-jemunya.
   He works tirelessly.
   Belum jera-jeranya Salim mencuri.
   Salim steals undaunted (not having learned from past
   experience).
Others in this group include:
  tidak puas-puasnya without ever getting enough
   tidak bosan-bosannya without ever getting bored
  tidak sembuh-sembuhnya without ever recovering
The verb base henti 'cease', with optional prefix ber-, also
occurs in this construction:
   Paman saya tak (ber)henti-hentinya merokok.
   My uncle smokes incessantly.
2.173 Adverbs derived by reduplication of the adjective
with affixation se-...-nya are discussed with examples in
section 1.136.
In this group are a few set expressions consisting of se- plus
adjective plus noun, such as sepuas hati 'to one's heart's
content' and sekuat tenaga 'with all one's strength':
   Kamu boleh bermain sepuas hati.
   You can play to your heart's content.
2.174 The forms described in 1.136 can be replaced by a
construction in which the reduplication and -nya are replaced
by mungkin 'possible':
   Dia memukul temannya sekeras-kerasnya/sekeras
   mungkin.
   He hit his friend as hard as possible.
   Kita harus berangkat selekas-lekasnya/selekas mungkin.
   We must leave as soon as possible.
2.175 Words which rarely or never occur as adjectives tend
to function adverbally without reduplication or a preceding
preposition, such as terus-menurus 'continuous', asyik 'busy',
serentak 'in unison, at the same time' (of a number of people
acting together), sekaligus 'together, at the same time (of
action done to several things at once)':
   Hujan turun terus-menerus.
   Rain fell continuously.
   Tetangganya asyik bekerja di sawah.
   His neighbours were busily working in the fields.
   Semua orang serentak berdiri.
   All the people stood up together.
   Dia minum semua tablet sekaligus.
   He took all the tablets at once.
Others in this group include:
  segera immediately
  langsung directly
  terus continuously
  tetap permanently
  mutlak unconditionally
  langsung directly, immediately
2.176 The words begini, seperti ini 'like this, in this way',
begitu, demikian, seperti itu like that' are adverbs of manner:
   Mengapa mereka dihina begitu?
   Why were they humiliated like that?
   Setiap tahun ribuan hektar tanah menghilang begini.
   Every year thousands of hectares of land are lost in this
   way.
2.177 A set of manner adverbs based on numbers indicate
the number of people or things involved together in the
action. Reduplicated numbers can occur alone (see 1.25 for
examples) or with prefix ber- (see 1.160 for examples).
Alternatively the numbers can be separated by demi or per:.
   Mereka keluar dua demi dua.
   They came out two by two.
   Satu per satu para terdakwa dijatuhi hukuman penjara.
   One by one the accused were sentenced to jail.
The phrase sedikit demi sedikit 'little by little' can also be
grouped here.
Other manner adverbs based on numbers are described in
sections 1.158-60 and 1.163.
2.178 The adverbs sendirian, seorang diri and,
colloquially, sendiri (see 2.51) mean 'by oneself, alone':
   Anak itu bermain sendirian/seorang diri/sendiri di
   taman.
   The child played alone in the park.
2.179 The reduplicated form sendiri-sendiri means 'apart,
separately':
   Mereka memasak sendiri-sendiri.
 ' They cook separately.
2.180 Both sendiri and the phrase dengan sendirinya
mean 'automatically, by itself, of its own accord' when
referring to action by an inanimate subject:
   Lemari itu terbuka sendiri.
   The cupboard opened by itself.
   Batu ginjal keluar dengan sendirinya.
   The kidney stone came out by itself
2.181 As adverbs of manner ramai and banyak are
restricted to preceding certain passive verbs to indicate that
the action is performed by a great many people:
   Pasar Lewolebo ramai dikunjungi oleh para pedagang.
   The Lewolebo market is visited by large numbers of
   traders.
Adjuncts of time
2.182 An adjunct of time can be a noun phrase, a
prepositional phrase or a word. Adjuncts can indicate both
specific time and relative time.
Specific time does not make reference to the time of
utterance. Specific times can be clock times, days of the
week, months, years, and dates.
Relative time indicates when an action or state occurs in
relation to the present or some other event. It can be
indicated by a temporal marker within the predicate (see
2.142), by a subordinate clause of time (see 4.70) or by an
adjunct of time within the clause.
Clock times
2.183 These are usually expressed in terms of hours and
minutes or parts of an hour. The number indicating the hour
is preceded by jam or pukul 'o'clock':
   jam dua two o'clock
    pukul lima five o'clock
There are several ways of indicating minutes or parts of the
hour. For minutes after the hour and before the half hour the
minute is preceded by lebih 'more' or lewat 'past'. The word
menit 'minute' may follow:
  jam sembilan lebih sepuluh
  ten past nine
  pukul lima lewat dua puluh menit
  twenty minutes past five
For expressing the half hour setengah 'half is used before the
number of the following full hour. The word jam/pukul is
frequently omitted:
   (jam) setengah tiga half past two
Between the half hour and the following full hour minutes are
subtracted, the minute being preceded by kurang 'less':
   jam empat kurang delapan (menit)
   eight (minutes) to four
For quarter hours seperempat 'one quarter' is used as an
alternative to lima belas (menit):
   jam lima lebih seperempat/jam lima lebih lima belas
    a quarter past five
    pukul dua kurang seperempat/pukul dua kurang lima
   belas menit
    a quarter to two
It is becoming increasingly common to simply place the
minute after the hour; with this system counting always
precedes forward to the full hour:
   jam enam tiga puluh six thirty
   jam dua empat puluh two forty
Parts of the day, pagi 'morning until about ten', siang
'between about ten and four', sore 'between about four and
six' and malam 'night' can follow the time, equivalent to 'a.m.,
in the morning' and so on:
   jam lima pagi five o'clock in the morning
   jam tujuh malam seven at night
In formal contexts a twenty four hour clock is used. The time
is always preceded by pukul and minutes are counted forward
to the full hour:
    pukul delapan belas tiga puluh
    eighteen thirty hours (six thirty p.m.)
Days of the week
2.184 The days of the week are proper names (see 2.3):
   Minggu, Ahad Sunday
   Senin Monday
   Selasa Tuesday
   Rabu Wednesday
   Kamis Thursday
   Jumat Friday
   Sabtu Saturday
The names of the days are preceded by hari 'day':
  Dia berangkat hari Senin.
  He left on Monday.
Parts of the day can follow the name of the day; in this case
hari is frequently omitted:
   Senin pagi Monday morning
   (hari) Jumat malam Friday night
The word malam can precede the name of the day to indicate
the preceding night:
   maiam Minggu Saturday night
The names of special days of the year are also preceded by
hari:
   Hari Natal Christmas Day
   Hari Angkatan Bersenjata Armed Forces Day
Months
2.185 The names of months are proper nouns:
   Januari January     Juli July
   Februari, Pebruari  Agustus August
    February           September September
   Maret March         Oktober October
   April April         Nopember, November
   Mei May              November
   Juni June           Desember December
The names of the months are preceded by bulan 'month : 1  Dia lahir bulan Maret.
  She was born in March.
Years
2.186 The name of a year is expressed either by stating it
as a cardinal number (see 2.107) or by stating the part
referring to the century separately. The number is preceded
by tahun 'year . Thus '1994' is expressed in either of the
                1following ways:
   tahun seribu sembilan ratus sembilan puluh empat
   tahun sembilan belas sembilan puluh empat
   nineteen ninety four
If the part referring to the century is stated separately the
group number for the decade, puluh, may be omitted. Nol
'zero' can precede a final number under ten:
   tahun sembilan belas sembilan tiga
   nineteen ninety three
   tahun sembilan belas (nol) tiga
   nineteen (o) three
Eras can be expressed by placing Sebelum Masehi 'before
Christ', abbreviated to SM 'BC' in writing, or Masehi '(after)
Christ', abbreviated to M 'AD' in writing, after the year:
   tahun sepuluh enam puluh enam Masehi 1066 AD
Years in the Moslem calendar are marked by Hijrah,
abbreviated H:
   1295 H the year 1295 in the Moslem calendar
Decades can be referred to as indicated in section 1.157.
Dates
2.187 The date is indicated by a cardinal number preceded
by tanggal 'date'. The name of the month or the month and
year can follow:
   tanggal lima the fifth
   tanggal tiga Februari the third of February
   tanggal delapan Juni tahun seribu sembilan ratus
   sembilan puluh empat
   the eighth of June 1994
Prepositional phrases indicating specific time
2.188 The preposition pada usually precedes noun phrases
indicating specific time (see 2.124):
   Anaknya lahir pada tanggal dua Oktober.
   Her child was born on the second of October.
   Kami mulai bekerja pada jam delapan.
   We begin work at eight o'clock.
However, pada can be omitted:
  Toko ini buka (pada) jam tujuh.
  This shop opens at seven o'clock.
  Pak Susanto pindah ke Surabaya (pada) tanggal
  lima/bulan September.
  Mr Susanto moved to Surabaya on the fifth/in September.
Phrases with pada can contain a word which indicates which
part of the time period is being referred to, including awal
'beginning', pertengahan 'middle' and akhir 'end':
   pada awal tahun delapan puluhan
   at the beginning of the nineteen eighties
In some contexts di can occur instead of pada (see 2.124).
2.189 Other prepositions occurring in time adjuncts
include:
   sebelum before
   sesudah after
   menjelang approaching, towards
   sekitar about, around
   Para calon harus melapor sebelum jam dua.
   The candidates must report before two o'clock.
   menjelang akhir tahun
   approaching the end of the year
   sekitar pukul sepuluh
   around ten o'clock
Phrases indicating relative time
2.190 There are a great many words, phrases and
expressions indicating relative time, only a few of which are
listed here.
2.191 Some adjuncts of time indicate time relative to the
present while others can indicate time relative either to the
present or to some other event. Adjuncts of time include:
   sekarang now
   kini now, nowadays
   dulu, dahulu earlier, previously
   kemudian afterwards
   akhir-akhir ini recently
   baru-baru ini recently
   mula-mula at first
   akhirnya finally
   sebentar lagi in a moment
   tadi recently, a short while ago
   nanti soon, shortly
   kelak later
   Akhir-akhir ini prestasinya terus menanjak»
   Recently his performance has continued to improve.
   Mereka berangkat tadi.
   They left a short time ago.
   Kelak saya ingin punya banyak anak.
   Later I want to have lots of childien.
2.192 Phrases with hari 'day , bulan 'month , and so on, can
                               1              1combine with ini 'this :
                     1   hari ini today
   bulan ini this month
They can also combine with (yang) lalu 'past' and depan,
(yang) akan datang 'next':
   tahun lalu last year
   minggu depan/yang akan datang next week
These can occur with a number:
  dua minggu lalu two weeks ago
  beberapa tahun yang lalu several years ago
Referring to time relative to some other event these
expressions can be expanded in numerous ways:
   beberapa jam sesudah itu several hours after that
   dua hari kemudian two days later
   keesokan harinya the following day
2.193 Adjuncts of time also refer to specific days before or
after the present, optionally followed by an indication of the
part of the day:
   kemarin yesterday
   kemarin dulu the day before yesterday
   besok tomorrow
   iusa in two days time
   kemarin pagi yesterday morning
2.194 While nanti and tadi can occur alone as adjuncts of
relative time (see 2.191) they can also occur with nouns
indicating parts of the day to indicate past or future within the
24 hour period; they can occur either before or after the
noun for the time period, expressions with the adjunct last
being more formal:
   tadi malam, malam tadi last night
   tadi pagi, pagi tadi this morning
   nanti sore, sore nanti this evening
The only combination not possible is that of nanti and pagi.
For 'tomorrow morning* besok pagi is used. Tadi is used
after the period of the day referred to is past; nanti if the
period has not yet arrived. Thus, if it is still morning at the
moment of utterance the phrase pagi ini 'this morning' is
used, rather than tadi pagi.
2.195 The periods of the day can be reduplicated to form
adjuncts of time. Thus pagi-pagi 'early in the morning' from
pagi 'morning':
   Kita harus berangkat pagi-pagi.
   We must set off early in the morning.
The other forms in this group are:
  siang-siang early in the day
  sore-sore late in the day
  malam-malam late at nightAdjuncts of frequency
2.196 Many adjuncts indicate the frequency with which an
action occurs, as illustrated by berkali-kali 'repeatedly' and
jarang 'rarely':
   Dia sudah berkali-kali dipanggil.
   He's already been called repeatedly.
   Ia jarang datang kemari.
   She rarely comes here.
Other adjuncts of frequency include:
   kadang-kadang sometimes
  sekali-sekali occasionally, now and then
  sering, sering kali, kerap, kerap kali, acap kali
      frequently, often
  selalu, senantiasa always
   berulang kali, berulang-ulang repeatedly
  biasanya usually
  umumnya usually, generally
The phrase tidak pernah 'never' occurs within the predicate
and is illustrated in section 2.157.
The adjuncts jarang and sering can occur with several of the
modifying adverbs mentioned in section 2.100:
  Jarang sekali mereka makan di rumah.
  They very rarely eat at home.
  Makin sering mereka bertengkar.
  They argue more and more frequently.
2.197 Numbers can occur with kali 'times' to indicate how
many times the action occurs:
   Kami sudah ke sana dua/beberapa kali.
   We've been there twice/several times.
These expressions can be expanded to indicate how often
within a certain time period the action occurs:
   Dia menulis kepada istrinya dua kali seminggu.
   He writes to his wife twice a week.
   Sekali sebulan kita mengadakan rapat.
   We hold a meeting once a month.
Sekali 'once' can occur after indication of the time period:
  dua minggu sekali once every two weeks
  setiap bulan sekali once every month
2.198 Preposition untuk followed by an ordinal number
and kali(nya) indicates how many times in a sequence the
action has occurred:
   untuk pertama kali for the first time
   untuk ketiga kalinya for the third time
   Untuk pertama kalinya orang desa melihat pesawat
   terbang.
   For the first time the village people saw an aeroplane.
The indefinite ordinal number kesekian occurs in such
expressions:
   Untuk kesekian kalinya mereka memprotes vonis
   hukuman mati.
   For the umpteenth time they protested against the death
   sentence.
The time period within which the event has occurred that
many times can also be mentioned:
   untuk kedua kali bulan ini
   For the second time this month
2.199 A time period with prefix se- (see 1.146) occurs
alone to indicate that the action is done by a certain number
of people or to a certain number of people or things once in
such a period; the number is mentioned in the phrase
identifying the people or things:
   Lebih dari delapan ribu turis mengunjungi pulau itu
   sebulan.
   More than eight thousand tourists visit the island a month.
   Pabriknya menghasilkan empat puluh pesawat setahun.
   His factory produces forty planes a year.
2.200 Nouns indicating a period of time can be preceded
by setiap, tiap-tiap, tiap, saban 'every :
                                      1   Setiap hari Selasa ada rapat.
   Every Tuesday there is a meeting.
These phrases can be preceded by hampir 'almost':
  hampir setiap jam almost every hourAdjuncts of duration and distance
2.201 These indicate how long an action or state lasts
(duration) or over what physical distance it occurs (distance).
2.202 Adjuncts of duration can be noun phrases
containing a cardinal number indicating a period of time:
   Kami tinggal di sana dua tahun.
   We lived there two years.
Such phrases can also refer to physical distance:
   Mereka berjalan tiga kilometer.
  They walked three kilometers.
The adjunct can be preceded by several adverbs, including
hampir 'almost' and kira-kira 'about':
  Dia bekerja di Semarang hampir tiga bulan.
  He worked in Semarang for almost three months.
2.203 Nouns indicating a period of time can be
reduplicated and prefixed with ber- to indicate duration of an
indefinite number of such time periods (see 1.144). This can
optionally be followed by lamanya 'long (of time)' or
preceded by sejak 'since':
   Dia berkeliaran di sini berminggu-minggu.
   He's been wandering around here for weeks.
   Berjam-jam lamanya saya berusaha.
   I've been trying for hours.
   Jembatan desa itu sejak bertahun-tahun tidak pernah
   diperbaiki.
   The village bridge has never been repaired for years.
These constructions can also refer to indefinite physical
distances:
   Kita sudah berjalan berkilo-kilo.
   We've already walked for kilometers.
2.204 Other adjuncts of duration include:
- lama long (of time)
   sebentar, sesaat, sekilas, sekejap, sejenak a moment
   sepanjang hari, sehari-harian all day long
   sepanjang malam, semalam-malaman all night long
   Tunggu sebentar!
   Wait a moment!
   Lama mereka duduk di situ.
   They've been sitting there a long time.
Lama can take a number of modifying adverbs (see 2.100),
or a negative:
   agak lama rather long
   tidak lama not long
prepositions in adjuncts of duration
2.205 Prepositions of duration include:
   sejak since
   selama during, for (as long as)
   sampai, hingga, sehingga until
   untuk for
These can occur with phrases indicating time periods:
  Mereka tinggal di Jakarta untuk/selama tiga setengah
  tahun.
  They lived in Jakarta for three and a half years.
  Ibu di rumah sakit sejak minggu lalu.
  Mother has been in hospital since last week.
Untuk 'for and selama 'for, during' can be omitted, as in the
          1first example in section 2.202.
Sampai and hingga can also refer to physical extent:
  Saya membaca sampai/hingga halaman tiga puluh.
  I read up to page thirty.
  Kami berjalan kaki sampai desa Jatisari.
  We walked as far as the village of Jatisari.
There are a number of combinations of such prepositions
with adjuncts of time (see 2.191) and with some conjunctions,
such as sementara 'meanwhile':
   Hingga kini mereka belum mengambil tindakan.
   Until now they haven't taken action.
   Untuk sementara dia harus berobat.
   For the time being he must have medical treatment.
2.206 The prepositions dekat 'near' and jauh dari 'far
from' indicate how close to or far from something the action
takes place:
   Mereka tinggal dekat kami.
   They live near us.
   Mereka bekerja jauh dari rumah.
   They work a long way from home.
Jauh can be negated: tidak jauh dari 'not far from :1   Ia dirawat di poliklinik tak jauh dari tempat itu.
   She was nursed in a clinic not far from that place.
A measurement noun phrase (see 2.30) can also indicate the
distance of the event from something else:
   Dia berdiri beberapa meter dari tepi jalan.
   He stood several meters from the edge of the road.
2.207 There are several combinations of prepositional
phrases which indicate the time or distance within which the
action occurs.
A prepositional phrase with dari 'from or sejak 'since can be
                                       1                 1followed by another prepositional phrase with sampai,
sampai dengan, hingga 'until, up to':
   Dia bekerja di Jakarta dari bulan Agustus sampai bulan
   Nopember.
   He worked in Jakarta from August until November.
   Dia sekantor dengan saya sejak awal tahun lalu hingga
   kini.
   He's been in the same office as me from the beginning of
   last year until the present.
   Saya membaca dari halaman dua belas sampai dengan
   halaman dua puluh.
   I read from page twelve to page twenty.
A prepositional phrase beginning with antara 'between' can
be followed by another prepositional phrase beginning with
dan or dengan 'and':
   Antara jam delapan dengan jam sebelas kami tidak ada
   di rumah.
   Between eight and ten o'clock we won't be at home.
   Ada perbedaan pendapat antara keluarga Hari dengan
   keluarga paman.
   There is a difference of opinion between Hari's family and
   uncle's family.
Location
2.208 Adjuncts of location state where an event occurs.
With verbs of motion they also refer to source and direction.
These adjuncts are mostly prepositional phrases, discussed in
sections 2.118-25.
Instrument and means
2.209 The preposition is dengan 'with; by':
   Dia memotong kayu dengan parang.
   He chopped the wood with a machete.
   Dia mengirim surat dengan pos udara.
   He sent the letter by airmail.
In some passive clauses dengan can be omitted (see 3.37).","[235, 236, 237, 238, 239, 240, 241, 242, 243, 244, 245, 246, 247, 248, 249, 250, 251, 252, 253]"
"The copulas adalah and ialah
3.14 The copulas, which correspond to what are
sometimes called link verbs in grammars of other languages,
are adalah and ialah. They occur optionally between the
subject and predicate in non-verbal clauses. The two forms
are interchangeable except that ialah only occurs after third
person subjects.
Copulas occur most commonly in noun clauses and some
Indonesians regard them as unacceptable in any other clause
types. However, they are readily used by other speakers in
some other non-verbal clauses, especially in adjective clauses.
Copulas mark the division between subject and predicate.
They are not obligatory and are least likely to occur in short
constructions such as Ayah guru 'Father is a teacher'.
They are most common in noun clauses where either the
subject or predicate is long, in which case they break up a
string of nouns and add a smoothness to the construction:
   Ayah Tomo adalah pegawai Bank Indonesia.
   Tomo's father is an employee of the Bank of Indonesia.
   Kain kebaya ialah pakaian wanita Jawa.
   The kain kebaya is the clothing of Javanese women.
Copulas are also frequently used if the predicate is a
nominalised verb, bahwa clause or untuk clause (see 3.6 for
examples).
The following examples illustrate copulas in adjective and
prepositional clauses:
   Setiap calon pembeli adalah penting.
   Each prospective purchaser is important.
   Satu-satunya air yang ada adalah dari telaga.
   The only water there is is from the lake.
Although they can occur with locative predicates, the copulas
do not occur before preposition di. Instead ada occurs (see
3.58).
The copulas adalah and ialah are not verbs; they precede the
entire predicate including a negative. The combination of a
copula and negative is, however, rare:
   Bahasa Indonesia adalah bukan bahasa yang penampil
   subyek.
   Indonesian is not a subject-prominent language.
   Pernyataan ketua koperasi itu adalah tidak benar.
   The statement by the chairman of the cooperative is not
   correct.
Several other words are sometimes referred to as copulas
because they serve to link two noun phrases. However, these
words, including merupakan 'be, constitute' and menjadi 'be,
become', are full verbs and can be negated.","[265, 266]"
"Topic-comment clauses
3.87 In addition to the nuclear phrases occurring in basic
clauses (see 3.2), a topic-comment clause contains an extra
nuclear component, the topic. Topic-comment clauses are
used to highlight a particular noun phrase. This phrase is
taken from the basic clause and placed before it, becoming
the topic. The rest of the clause is then a comment on the
topic. The place from which the topic is taken is marked by
-nya. There are two types of topic-comment clause, those
whose topic is based on a possessor, called here possessor
topic-comment clauses, and those whose topic is based on an
object, called here object topic-comment clauses.
Possessor topic-comment clauses
3.88 This construction is based on a clause whose subject
noun phrase contains a possessor. The possessor is placed
before the clause, becoming the topic. Its place in the subject
is marked by -nya. This process is illustrated by the
following example, the basic clause being given first, then the
topic comment clause:
   Nama sopir itu Pak Ali.
   The name of that driver is Mr Ali.
   Sopir itu namanya Pak Ali.
   Concerning that driver, his name is Mr Ali.
In the basic clause above the subject is nama sopir itu 'the
name of that driver'. The possessor, sopir itu 'that driver',
becomes the topic, its place being marked by -nya. Thus in
the topic-comment clause the topic is sopir itu 'that driver'
and the comment is namanya Pak Ali 'his name is Mr Ali'.
A topic-comment clause has the force of 'as for [topic], ...' or
'concerning [topic], ...', as in the above example. Such a
construction is, however, frequently unnatural in English,
although used in the above example to convey the force of
this construction. The emphasis on the topic is accompanied
by a rise in pitch (rising intonation). A slight pause may also
occur after the topic; in writing a comma can but need not
follow the topic. The translations of the following examples
do not necessarily convey the force of the Indonesian
construction:
    Jakarta wajahnya sudah mulai berubah.
    The face of Jakarta has begun to change.
  ' Para pegawai gajinya tidak akan naik.
    The salary of the employees will not rise.
    Teman saya, anaknya tiga.
    My friend, he has three children.
    Mahasiswa itu, rambutnya tidak pernah disisir.
    That student, his hair is never combed.
The place of the topic in the subject is always marked by
-nya, even if it is plural:
   Mereka adiknya dipanggil polisi.
   (As for them) their brother has been summoned by the
   police.
Some Indonesians accept a first or second person topic, such
as the following, while others reject this construction:
   Saya asalnya dari Semarang.
    (As for me) I'm from Semarang.
In informal speech it is common to put kalau before the
topic:
   Kalau Pak Yanto, anaknya sudah kawin.
   As for Mr Yanto, his children are already married.
The topic can be a demonstrative pronoun (see 2.65), as in
the following example. In this case the basic clause can be
regarded as containing a possessive noun, such as nama
benda ini 'the name of this thing : 1   Ini namanya Monas, Monumen Nasional.
   This is named Monas, the National Monument, (literally:
   (As for) this, its name is Monas, the National Monument.)
3.89 With some possessor topic-comment clauses
foregrounding of the predicate is also possible, by placing it
before the subject. Thus the first example above could be
changed to:
   Jakarta sudah mulai berubah wajahnya.
   The face of Jakarta has begun to change.
If the predicate precedes the subject a comma is not placed
after the topic in writing and in speech there is usually no
pause. The predicate can only precede the subject if the
subject is something inalienably possessed by the topic. This
is shown by the following example. In the first construction
the thing possessed by the topic Pak Ali is mata 'eyes'. Eyes
are something inalienably possessed, something intrinsic to or
      This example is from Dardjowidjojo (1978: 165). Such
      constructions are rejected by Verhaar (1984: 62), among others.
part of the possessor. In the first construction therefore the
subject can occur after the predicate. In the second
construction the thing possessed is istri 'wife . However, a wife
                                                  1is not something inalienably possessed, it is not part of the
possessor; Pak Ali remains the same without a wife.
Consequently the subject of this construction cannot follow
the predicate: 6   Pak Ali matanya dioperasi.
   Pak Ali dioperasi matanya.
   Mr Ali's eyes were operated on.
   Pak Ali istrinya dioperasi.
   Mr Ali's wife was operated on.
The following examples of topic-comment constructions with
inverted subject and predicate all refer to inalienable
possession:
   Mereka itu kolot pikirannya.
   Their thinking is old-fashioned.
   Dilihat dari bawah, orang itu seperti semut saja
   besarnya.
   Seen from below, those people look as big as ants,
   (literally: ... those people, their size is like an ant.)
   Golongan itu bertambah hari bertambah kuat suaranya.
   The voice of that group gets stronger by the day.
3.90 The pronouns formed from collective numbers, as in
2.94, and indefinite numbers, as in 2.95, can occur as subject
of a topic-comment construction whose topic identifies the
noun they refer to. Although there is not a possessor-
possessed relationship between topic and subject the
construction is based on analogy with the possessor topic-
comment form:
   Saudagar itu ketiga-tiganya berasal dari Jepara.
 ' All three of those merchants come from Jepara.
   Anak ini semuanya berasal dari Nusa Tenggara.
   All of these children come from Nusa Tenggara.","[305, 306, 307, 308]"
"
       The Classical Malay example is from the Hikayat Pandawa Lima,
       quoted by Kaswanti Purwo (1984: 186). The other two examples are
       from Verhaar (1984: 53) and Toer (1980: 314) respectively.
Particle lah in imperatives
4.40 In writing and formal speech -lah is optionally
added to the verb in imperative constructions. This can also
occur in informal styles but is much less frequent. Its
occurrence here is to mark the predicate, which is out of its
normal position, occurring at the beginning of the clause (see
3.51):
   Bukalah pintu itu!
   Open that door!
   Berangkatlah sekarang!
   Depart now!
It is frequently stated in teaching texts that -lah makes an
imperative polite. Some writers even translate it as 'please .       1Further, it is used so frequently in some works as to give the
impression it is more or less obligatory and some even refer
to it as an 'imperative particle'. However, it is probably the
case that for most Indonesians -lah does not function as a
softener and rarely occurs in imperative constructions in
everyday speech. Moreover, some people even regard an
imperative with -lah as being stronger rather than softer.      5Softeners in imperatives.
4.41 A number of words can be used in imperatives to
make them softer or to produce polite requests. These are
discussed in sections 4.42-7.
Tag ya
4.42 In section 4.11 it is noted that as a sentence tag in
informal statements ya allows the speaker to avoid the
impression of making a firm assertion. In imperatives it has
the same function. By drawing the listener into agreement it
avoids the impression of a firm order:
   Jendela ditutup, ya, sebelum tidur.
   Shut the window, won't you, before you go to bed.        6
     Among many texts which assert that -lah makes an imperative
     more polite are Johns (1978: 23), Sarumpaet (1977: 145), and
     Dardjowidjojo (1978: 108-9). Dardjowidjojo calls it an 'imperative
     particle*. On the other hand, Sugono (1986: 55) states that -lah
     makes a command firmer.
     This example is from Johns (1978: 276).
Silakan \please'
4.43 Silakan (or silahkan), translated 'please , invites the
                                                 1addressee to do something for his or her own benefit. Prefix
meN- drops with transitive verbs:
   Silakan masuk.
   Please come in.
   Silakan ambil kue.
   Please take some cake.
Tolong, coba, harap in imperatives
4.44 These three words occur with imperatives to make
them polite, preceding what would otherwise be a firmer
order. Prefix meN- drops if there is a specific object (see
4.34). A transitive verb can be passive, in which case the
subject can occur before or after the verb.
Tolong
4.45 Translated 'please , tolong requests the addressee to
                           1do something for the speaker's benefit (cf. menolong 'help ).
                                                            1It is frequently used by one with less authority to one with
more authority or seniority, or to someone of the same status
who is not well known to the speaker:
    Tolong ambilkan saya jas itu.
    Please fetch me that jacket.
    Tolong dicuci pakaian ini.
    Please have these clothes washed.
Tolong is only used with transitive verbs and only then if the
verb has a specific object, prefix meN- being deleted.
Coba
4.46 Also translatable 'please', coba frequently has a
suggestion of urging (cf. mencoba 'try'). It differs from
tolong in that it is not usually used in a request for the
speaker's own benefit. Unlike tolong, it can occur with
intransitive verbs. It is almost always used by seniors to
juniors or between people of equal status:
    Coba duduk baik-baik, Andi.
   Please sit properly, Andi.
    Coba anjingmu diikat, Mardi.
   Please tie your dog up, Mardi.
Coba can occur with klta 'we (inclusive)', the addressee is then
urged to join the speaker in the action:
   Coba kita lihat siapa yang ada di sana.
   Let's see who's there.
It can also be used with saya 'I', the addressee being urged to
allow the speaker to perform the action:
    Coba saya lihat PR-mu.
    Let me see your homework.
Harap
4.47 This word is politer than coba and can be used to
elders and seniors. It is somewhat softer than 'please', the
expression 'would you please' usually being a more
appropriate translation (cf. berharap 'hope'). It may, like
tolong, seek help for the speaker but is not restricted to this:
   Harap telepon Tuti di rumah.
   Please telephone Tuti at home.
   Harap buku saya dikembalikan.
   Would you please return my book.
Like coba, it can be used with intransitive and pseudo-
intransitive verbs, prefix meN- being retained:
    Harap berdiri.
    Would you please stand up.
    Harap menulis di sini.
    Please write here.
The addressee can be mentioned:
  Harap bapak tunggu sebentar.
  Would you please wait a moment, sir.
Softeners occurring with Jangan
4.48 Tolong, coba and harap can be placed before
negative imperatives:
   Tolong jangan antarkan Siti ke setasiun sekarang.
   Please don't take Siti to the station now.
   Coba jangan diganggu anjing itu.
   Please don't annoy the dog.
   Harap jangan marah.
   Please don't be angry.
Softeners occurring with -lah
4.49 If -lah (see 3.51) occurs with a softener it usually
attaches to the softener, which is the first word of the clause.
Alternatively, it can follow the verb:
    Tolonglah buka jendela itu.
    Tolong bukalah jendela itu.
    Please open that window.
Requests
4.50 There are a number of ways of requesting someone
to perform an action apart from adding a softener to a basic
imperative. Sometimes the construction is essentially the
same as in a basic imperative but this is not always so. Very
polite requests are briefly discussed in section 4.53.
Requests with minta and mohon
4.51 The verbs (me)minta and (me)mohon both occur in
statements with the meaning 'request*. Simple, direct requests
with them are, however, in imperative mood:
   Minta air.
   Can I please have some water.
    Minta tolong.
   Would you please help me.
   Mohon undangan dibawa.
   Please bring your invitation.
Unlike the softeners, mohon and minta cooccur with either
tidak or jangan to form a negative request, although some
people accept only tidak in this context (see also 3.128):
   Mohon tidak merokok.
   Please don't smoke.
   Mohon jangan iri hati.
   Please don't be jealous.
Requests with hendaklah and hendaknya
4.52 The words hendaklah and hendaknya, meaning
'please, it is requested, you should', form polite requests,
usually conveying a suggestion that the action should be
performed.
    Hendaknya koper-koper dikunci.
   Suitcases should be locked.
   Hendaklah membalas surat ini dengan segera.
   Would you please reply to this letter at once.
Very polite requests
4.53 A number of words occur, either alone or in
combination, to form very polite requests. They are followed
by a full clause, including the second person subject. The
most frequently used word is sudi 'be prepared to; have the
pleasure to':
   Sudi bapak duduk.
   Would you please be seated, sir.
The word kiranya '(I) wonder; apparently' can form requests
meaning 'kindly, please':
  Saya minta kiranya anda membalas surat ini.
  I request that you kindly respond to this letter.
Several combinations with sudi and kiranya are even politer,
such as sudilah kiranya:
   Sudilah kiranya saudara membawa barang itu ke sini.
   Would you be so good as to bring those things here.
The formula sudi apalah kiranya introduces a supplication:
  Sudi apalah kiranya bapak memberikan bantuan
  kepada pembawa surat ini.
  Would you please be so kind as to give assistance to the
  bearer of this letter.
Constructions with mari and ayo
4.54 Mari is used to urge the addressee to join the
speaker in the activity, being translated 'let us'. First person
inclusive pronoun kita optionally occurs:
    Mari kita pergi ke bioskop.
  ' Let's go to the movies.
    Mari makan.
    Let's eat.
Particle -lah can be attached to mari:
   Marilah (kita) menyanyi.
   Let us sing.
Ayo has a similar meaning but is more informal. Unlike
mari it cannot be used to older people, only to equals and
juniors. It has a sense of 'come on, let's ...':
   Ayo kita makan dulu.
   Come on, let's eat now.
If the verb has a specific object then meN- is omitted (see
4.34):
    Mari kita habiskan kue ini.
   Let's finish off this cake.
   Ayo kita habiskan!
   Come on, let's finish it off!
These words cannot cooccur with jangan. Thus in a
construction urging the addressee to join the speaker in not
doing something, they are absent. However, kita must occur:
   Jangan kita pergi ke sana.
   Let's not go there.
Mari can be used with a first person pronoun if the speaker
wishes to do something for the benefit of the addressee. The
verb must be transitive and have a specific object;
consequently meN- does not occur on the verb (see 4.34):
   Mari saya bawakan tas bapak.
   Let me carry your bag.
Both mari and ayo can be used to invite the addressee to do
something, in this function being similar to silakan (see 4.43),
although less formal:
    Mari/Ayo masuk!
    Come on in!
They can also be used as a very informal way of taking leave:
  Mari/Ayo.
  Bye, see you.
Mari is contrasted with biar in section 4.56.
Constructions with biar
4.55 Biar means 'let, allow'. In imperatives it urges the
addressee to allow a course of action to occur. It can refer to
action by any person except the addressee. Particle -lah can
be attached to biar:
   Biar dia tidur!
   Let him sleep!
   Biarlah saya sendiri menemani dia!
   Let me accompany him myself!
   Biarlah undangan itu diantarkan sekarang!
   Let the invitation be delivered now!
Mari and biar contrasted
4.56 Because mari urges the addressee to join with the
speaker while biar excludes the addressee from participating,
the former can cooccur with kita (see 4.54) while the latter
can occur with any first or second person pronoun except
kita, including kami 'we (exclusive)':
   Mari kita pergi!
   Let us (you and me) go!
   Biar kami pergi!
   Allow us (me and someone else) to go!","[355, 356, 357, 358, 359, 360, 361, 362]"
"Exclamations
4.57 Utterances in exclamatory mood express the
speaker's feelings or attitude, usually in an emphatic way.
They are often uttered forcefully and in writing this may be
indicated by an exclamation mark. Exclamations may be
single words, discussed in 4.58, or sentences, discussed in
section 4.59.
Interjections
4.58 Many exclamations are single words, also called
interjections, which are usually uttered as an immediate
reaction to some event to express surprise, anger, and so on.
There are a great many interjections; glosses to the following
few examples do not attempt to catch the precise force of the
Indonesian:
   Aduh! Oh! Oh dear!
   Astaga! Good heavens! Heaven forbid!
   Brengsek! Useless! (exclamation of disapproval)
   Cis! Bah! Tut! (exclamation of disgust)
   Kasihan! Poor thing! What a pity!
  Keparat! Damn!
  Lho! Gosh! What!
  Masa! Ridiculous! How could that be!
  Sialan! Damn! Blast!
Interjections can be used to attract someone's attention.
Examples are given in section 4.110.
Interjections can be followed by a sentence in one of the
other moods, which also tends to be exclamatory in tone:
   Wah! Mahal sekali!
   Gosh! Its really expensive!
   Masyaalah! Lantas, bagaimana?
   Good heavens! Then what happened?
   Celaka! Dia kembali lagi!
   Blast! He's coming back!
Exclamatory sentences
4.59 Exclamatory sentences are equivalent to exclamatory
sentences in English with 'how' followed by an adjective,
although more frequently in informal English expressions
using such interjections as 'gosh' are used. English
exclamations with 'what' followed by a noun phrase have no
direct equivalent in Indonesian; instead an interjection
followed by a statement may be used:
    Wah, enak sekali masakan ini!
   What a great meal!
The exclamatory sentence can consist of one of the forms
bukan main, alangkah, betapa, or (rarely) bukan buatan,
followed by an adjective with -nya:
   Bukan main besarnya! How big it is!
   Alangkah bagusnya! How beautiful!
   Betapa luasnya! How vast it is!
Bukan main can follow the adjective:
  Panasnya bukan main! Gosh, it's hot!
Bukan main can also occur alone as an interjection
expressing astonishment:
   Bukan main! Extraordinary!
4.60 A basic exclamation can be followed by a noun
phrase indicating the person or thing having the quality
referred to. The adjective corresponds to the predicate in a
basic adjective clause (see 3.9) and the noun phrase
corresponds to the subject of such a clause. Each of the
exclamatory sentences below is preceded by the basic clause
corresponding to it:
   Cerita itu lucu.
   That story is funny.
   Betapa lucunya cerita itu!
   Gosh that story is funny!
   Malapetaka yang menimpa mereka besar.
   The disaster which struck them was great.
   Alangkah besarnya malapetaka yang menimpa mereka!
   How great was the disaster which struck them!
4.61 The adjective in an exclamatory clause may
correspond to an adverb in a basic clause. In this case it is
followed by a subject-predicate structure. For each of the
following examples a basic clause containing an adverb is first
given, followed by the exclamatory sentence based on it:
   Mbak Koes menerima kami dengan ramah.
   Mbak Koes received us hospitably.
   Bukan main ramahnya Mbak Koes menerima kami!
   How hospitably Mbak Koes received us!
   Mereka bekerja dengan lambat.
   They are working slowly.
   Alangkah lambatnya mereka bekerja!
   Gosh, they're working slowly!
   Mereka melawan teroris dengan gigih.
   They opposed the terrorists resolutely.
   Betapa gigihnya mereka melawan teroris!
   How resolutely they opposed the terrorists!
4.62 Colloquially the adjective with -nya can occur alone,
often following an interjection:
   Wah, bagusnya!
   Gosh, it's beautiful!
   Aduh, kotornya jalan ini!
   Oh, this street's dirty!
COMPLEX SENTENCES
4.63 Sentences are either simple or complex. A simple
sentence consists of a single independent clause, accompanied
by an intonation contour. Many of the sentences occurring
in examples in Chapter Three are simple sentences. A
complex sentence is one which consists of more than a single
clause.
When two clauses occur in the one sentence they are
sometimes linked by a conjunction. Conjunctions both link
the clauses and specify the relationship between them. There
are two types of conjunction. Coordinating conjunctions,
sometimes called coordinators, link two independent clauses.
These are discussed in sections 4.64-8. Coordinators can also
link two phrases or words, as discussed in section 4.65.
Subordinating conjunctions, also called subordinators, link an
independent clause, called the main clause, and a clause which
adds further information about the main clause. This is called
a subordinate clause; it is always preceded by the conjunction.
Subordinating conjunctions are discussed in sections 4.69-
79.
Sometimes a sentence contains correlative structures, in which
two clauses, phrases or words are dependent on each other,
neither being able to occur alone; these are discussed in
sections 4.81-97.
Some sentences consist of a clause preceded by a word or
phrase which links it to the preceding sentence. These
constructions are discussed in sections 4.98-104. Other
sentences occur with a word or phrase, called a sentence
adjunct, which provides a comment on what is said. These are
discussed in sections 4.105-8. A sentence can also contain a
word which addresses the person being spoken to. Such
words, called vocatives, are discussed in sections 4.109-10.","[362, 363, 364, 365]"
"The verb ada
3.54 Ada is an intransitive verb which differs significantly
from other verbs and deserves special comment. It has a
number of functions.
3.55 In many of its occurrences ada means 'exist :    1   Tuhan ada.
   God exists.
3.56 Very similar to the meaning 'exist' is the meaning
translated by 'there' followed by the appropriate form of the
verb 'to be'. In this construction the subject must follow the
predicate:
   Ada koran di meja.
   There is a newspaper on the table.
Like other verbs, ada can be preceded by negative, temporal
markers and modals:
   Di Indonesia tidak ada kanguru.
   In Indonesia there are no kangaroos.
   Akan ada orang yang berdemonstrasi di luar
   kantornya.
   There will be people demonstrating outside his office.
When banyak occurs ada is optional:
  Tidak (ada) banyak mobil di jalan hari ini.
  There aren't many cars on the road today.
This construction also corresponds to English expressions
with 'some (are)':
   Ada yang besar, ada yang kecil.
   Some are big, some are small, (literally: There are big
   ones, there are small ones.)
3.57 In some constructions ada means 'have, own',
occurring with an obligatory complement (see 3.61), which
indicates the thing owned. This function of ada is most
common in colloquial style:
   Saya tidak ada uang.
   I don't have any money.
3.58 It occurs before the locative preposition di as a
linking verb meaning 'be'. In this context it is optional:
   Ayah (ada) di kantor.
   Father is in the office.
In this context ada cannot be equated with adalah, which
occurs as a copula before non-verbal predicates (see 3.14),
because ada, unlike adalah, is a verb and can be preceded by
such predicate elements as tidak 'not':
   Ayah tidak ada di kantor.
   Father isn't in the office.
The verb berada can occur instead of ada in this context:
   Sekarang kita berada di sebuah desa di Jawa Tengah.
   Now we are in a village in Central Java.
3.59 Similar to the construction in 3.58 is occurrence of
ada to indicate that someone has the subject in his or her
possession. The possessor is indicated in a phrase with
preposition pada:
   Buku Ali ada pada saya. I've got Ali's book.
3.60 It can occur before a verb as an intensifier; in this
case ada probably cannot itself be regarded as being a verb,
its role being similar to that of emphatic 'do' in English:
    Ia ada menerima surat itu.
    He did receive the letter.
    Adakah engkau merasai perubahan sesudah disunati?
    Did you feel a change after being circumcised?","[291, 292, 293]"
"Number pronouns
2.93 These are based on several types of definite and
indefinite numbers.
2.94 Collective numbers with prefix ke-, meaning 'both',
'all three' and so on (see 1.153), can take suffix -nya to form
pronouns. These forms can also have a reduplicated base,
with or without ke-, thus keduanya, kedua-duanya, dua-
duanya 'both of them, either of them', ketiganya, ketiga-
tiganya, tiga-tiganya 'all three of them':
 - Arti kedua kata itu sama; anda dapat mempergunakan
    kedua-duanya.
    The meanings of those two words are the same; you can
    use either of them.
In combination with a negative they are translated 'neither of
them, none of them, not any of them':
   Saya tidak suka kedua-duanya/dua-duanya/keduanya.
   I don't like either of them.
   Ini selokan atau jalan?         - Bukan dua-duanya.
   Is this a gutter or a road?     - (It is) neither.
These forms can occur as subjects in topic-comment
constructions (see 3.90).
2.95 Several indefinite numbers (see 2.113) can occur as
pronouns, in which case they take suffix -nya. These include:
   semuanya all of them
   segalanya all of them
   seluruhnya all of it, the whole
   Tidak semuanya meninggal.
   Not all of them died.
These forms can occur as subjects in topic-comment
constructions (see 3.90).
2.96 Masing-masing can occur as a number pronoun
meaning 'each of them'; it does not take -nya:
   Kedua kota itu hampir sama besarnya. Masing-masing
   berpenduduk sekitar empat ratus ribu orang.
   Those two cities are almost the same size. Each of them
   has a population of about four hundred thousand people.","[202, 203]"
"Combinations of Negative, Temporal
Marker and Modal
2.154 Many combinations of negative, temporal and modal
are possible. In general the first to occur modifies the
meaning of everything which follows within the predicate. In
the first example below tidak modifies boleh hadir 'may be
present', giving 'not the case that (he) may be present', while in
the second example boleh expresses the possibility of tidak
hadir 'not present', giving 'permissible (for him) not to be
present':
   Dia tidak boleh hadir.
   He is not allowed to be present.
   Dia boleh tidak hadir.
   He is allowed to be absent.
   Pelamar tidak harus kawin.
   Applicants do not need to be married.
   Pelamar harus tidak kawin.
   Applicants must be unmarried.
Sometimes a reversal of word order does not change
meaning. Thus sudah harus and harus sudah both mean
'must already':
   Kamu sudah harus di sini jam lima.
   Kamu harus sudah di sini jam lima.
   You must be here by five o'clock.
Not all combinations are possible and Indonesians differ in
what they find acceptable. Some combinations, while
occurring, are of very low frequency.
2.155 Two negatives may cooccur in the predicate. In the
following example the first tidak negates dapat. This
combination in turn modifies tidak terkena 'not subject to',
giving 'cannot be the case that (it) is not subject to'. In the
second example tidak negates tak terbatas 'unlimited':
   Bahasa Indonesia tidak dapat tidak terkena hukum
   perubahan.
   Indonesian cannot avoid being subject to the laws of
   change.
   Kekuasaan kepala negara tidak tak terbatas.
   The powers of a head of state are not unlimited.
2.156 Belum 'not yet' combines the meanings of bukan/
tidak plus temporal marker sudah:
   Dia belum professor.
   He isn't a professor yet.
   Mereka belum berangkat.
   They haven't left yet.
Sudah can precede tidak and bukan, the combination
indicating that what follows is no longer the case. Lagi (see
2.161) frequently occurs also:
   Karena asap menara pengendali sudah tidak terlihat
   lagi.
   Because of the smoke the control tower could no longer be
   seen.
   Dia sudah bukan pembantu lagi.
   She is no longer a servant.
2.157 For many speakers negatives do not combine with
sedang, masih, and baru, although tidak can precede akan
and pernah:
   Mereka tidak pernah pergi ke bioskop.
   They never go to the movies.
   Dia tidak akan datang.
   He won't come.
The combination belum pernah is equivalent to the negative
of sudah pernah and thus differs from tidak pernah, as in the
following examples:
   Saya belum pernah pergi ke sana.
   I have never been there.
   Saya tidak pernah pergi ke sana.
   I never go there.
2.158 There are only a few combinations of temporals,
usually involving akan:
   Apakah dia akan pernah mendapat pekerjaan?
   Will he ever get work?
The combination sudah akan means 'about to' when referring
to the past. Referring to the future sudah akan and akan
sudah both mean 'will have (done the action)':
   Dia sudah akan setuju tadi.
   He was about to agree just now.
   Kami akan sudah selesai kalau anda kembali jam lima.
   We will already be finished if you come back at five.
   Saya yakin dalam beberapa hari lagi surat anda sudah
   akan sampai.
   I am sure that in a few days your letter will have arrived.
The combination akan pernah and pernah akan can be
negated:
   Situasi itu tidak akan pernah timbul.
   That situation will never arise.
2.159 A combination of two modals always includes harus
'must':
   Australia harus dapat meyakinkan mitra dagangnya.
   Australia must be able to convince its trading partners.
Combinations of temporal and modal are common:
  Itulah yang masih harus dibuktikan.
  That's what still has to be proved.
  Dia bakal mampu menaklukkan mereka.
  He will be able to defeat them.
Some combinations of negative, temporal and modal occur:
  Partai itu tidak akan bisa membentuk pemerintahan.
  That party will not be able to form a government.
Saling
2.160 Before a verb saling marks reciprocal action. It can
occur with any verb which allows a human object. As with
verbs having reciprocal affixation (see 1.248 and 1.255), an
object does not occur. The English translation has 'each
other' as object:
   Mereka saling mengenal/memaafkan/mengunjungi.
   They know/forgive/visit each other.
Several -i verbs (see 1.212ff) optionally drop the suffix in the
presence of saling:
   Mereka saling mencuriga/mencinta, (cf. Dia
   mencurigai/mencintai istrinya.)
   They suspect/love each other, (cf. He suspects/loves his
   wife.)
Saling can occur redundantly with reciprocal verbs (see
1.251).
Kembali and lagi
2.161 The predicate centre can be followed by kembali or
lagi. Both mean 'again'; kembali also has the meaning 'return
to former state'. (Occurring before the predicate lagi is a
temporal marker meaning 'in the process' - see 2.146).
   Anak itu menangis lagi.
   That child is crying again.
   Koran yang dibredel sudah terbit kembali.
   The banned newspaper has reappeared.
The combination of a negative and lagi means 'no longer, not
any more' (see also 2.156):
   Dia bukan guru lagi.
   She's no longer a teacher.
For speakers from some regions the combination of belum
and lagi means 'not yet':
   Saya belum lapar lagi.
   I'm not hungry yet.","[229, 230, 231, 232, 233]"
"Exception
2.214 The preposition kecuali 'except' indicates who or
what is not included in the action:
   Tidak ada orang yang membantu dia kecuali ayahnya.
   No one helped him except his father.
Subject matter
2.215 Preposition tentang 'about' indicates that the action
concerns a particular subject or topic:
   Menlu memberi keterangan tentang peristiwa itu.
   The foreign minister gave an explanation about the matter.
More formally, mengenai 'about, concerning' can occur.
Focusing adjuncts
2.216 Focusing adjuncts identify the most important thing
involved in what is being said. There are several types.
Particle pun is also here included among the focusing
adjuncts (see 2.221). The foregrounding particles -lah and
-kah are discussed separately, -lah in sections 3.51-3 and
-kah in sections 4.23-6.
Limiters
2.217 Limiters restrict what is said to the part of the clause
on which attention is focused. Most limiters, including
hanya, cuma, semata-mata 'only', precede the predicate. The
focused item can vary depending on which word is given
stress. In the following example focus would normally be on
the fact that nothing was eated except bread. However, if
makan 'eat' receives stress, the sentence can indicate that the
only thing done to the bread was that it was eaten:
   Tadi pagi saya hanya makan roti.
   This morning I only ate bread.
The limiters saja and melulu 'just' follow the focused item:
  Tadi pagi saya makan roti saja.
  This morning I just ate bread.
Hanya and saja can combine to give additional emphasis:
  Dia hanya makan roti saja.
  He ate nothing but bread.
2.218 Some limiters restrict what is said particularly or
mainly to the part of the clause focused, including terutama
'especially, particularly' (see also 2.63) and khususnya 'in
particular':
   Kenaikan pendapatan itu terutama berasal dari pajak.
   The rise in income in particular comes from taxes.
Additives
2.219 Juga and pula 'also, too, as well', indicate that the
focused part is an addition. The focused item can vary
depending on what is given stress. Thus in the following
example the focused item, the addition, may be saya T (as
well as someone else), makan 'eat' (as well as the performance
of some other action, such as cooking), nasi 'rice' (as well as
other food):
   Saya makan nasi juga.
   I eat rice too.
Justru
2.220 Justru emphasises that a particular component of the
clause is the case rather than any other possibility, this being
contrary to what the listener might expect. Justru,
translatable 'precisely', usually precedes the focused
component, always doing so if it occurs last in the clause:
   Yang mengeluh justru Garuda.
   It was precisely Garuda which complained.
   Film-filmnya menjadi besar justru karena tema kecil.
   His movies became big precisely because of their small
   themes.
Otherwise justru sometimes follows the focused element and
is translatable 'the very one' or 'precisely':
    Di perusahaan semacam ini pegawai yang baik justru
    menjadi bulan-bulanan fitnah.
    In businesses like this good employees are the very ones
    who become the targets of slander.
    Saya datang ke sini karena saya justru melihat
    kemungkinan di desa ini.
    I came here precisely because I saw the possibilities in this
    village.
Particle pun
2.221 Particle pun acts as a focusing adjunct in some of its
functions. It can also act like a linking adjunct, as discussed
in section 2.222. Whatever its function, pun always follows
the subject of the clause and acts to emphasise it. Some
people always write it attached to the preceding word.
A number of conjunctions, such as meskipun 'although (see       14.76), and indefinite pronouns, such as tidak seorangpun 'no
one' (see 2.91), have pun as their final component (rarely
written as a separate word), which is clearly related in meaning
to the particle pun.
2.222 Sometimes pun acts to link two clauses which have
the same subject, being placed after the subject of the second
clause. In earlier literary Malay this device was very common
in constructions referring to a sequence of actions; in modern
Indonesian it is much rarer:
    Setelah Taifah mendengar kata perempuan itu, Taifah
    pun segera kembali ke rumahnya.
    After Taifah heard what the woman said he returned to his
    house.
    Maka sekali waktu baginda pergi berburu ke dalam
   hutan, maka baginda pun bertemu dengan seekor kijang
    ...
   Onc$ His Majesty went hunting in the forest. He came
   across a deer ...5
2.223 Two clauses can be linked by pun even if they have
different subjects. Pun follows the subject of the second
clause and emphasises it. The action of the second clause
always follows the action of the first clause; pun can thus
often be translated 'then' in such constructions:
   Teriakan Sukijan cepat didengar dan para tetangga pun
   mulai berdatangan.
   Sukijan's cries were quickly heard and the neighbours then
   began arriving.
   Berdasarkan surat kecil ini, polisi pun mulus melacak
   alamat mereka.
   On the basis of this brief letter the police were then easily
   able to trace their address.
   Merasa gundah dan tak tahu apa yang harus dia
   lakukan, Presiden pun bertanya...","[254, 255, 256, 257]"
"NOUNS AND NOUN PHRASES
2.2      A noun phrase is a sequence of words which
functions in the same way as a noun; that is, it occurs in the
same positions in a clause as a single noun. A noun phrase
always contains a noun as its head. Nouns are discussed in
section 2.3. The other major components of noun phrases
are discussed in sections 2.5 to 2.60. Some other components
of noun phrases are described elsewhere. A noun occurring
alone can be regarded as a (minimal) noun phrase (see 2.4).
Nouns
2.3      A noun can be defined as a word which refers to a
person, thing or abstract idea. A number of types of noun
can be distinguished.
The specific name of a person, thing, or place is called a
proper noun. Proper nouns are spelled with a capital letter:
Soeharto, Jakarta, Jawa, Kompas. Titles before proper
nouns are also treated as part of the proper noun: Presiden
Soeharto, Professor Subrata, Ibu Suparto. Names of
organisations, institutions, events, and countries are also
proper nouns: Bank Bumi Daya, Bandara Sukarno-Hatta,.
Idul Fitri, Australia.
A common noun refers to a person or thing which is a
member of a set; it is not the specific name of that person or
thing: kucing 'cat', pikiran 'thought , pulau 'island', orang
                                        1'person', penyakit 'illness'. A common noun can occur as a
proper noun when it is part of a specific name; thus
universitas 'university' is a common noun except when it is
part of the name of a specific university, as in Universitas
Indonesia 'University of Indonesia'.
Common nouns can be further divided into count nouns and
non-count (mass) nouns.
Count nouns refer to things which can be counted: buku
'book', rumah 'house', pendapat 'opinion'. These can be
directly preceded by a number (see 2.14) or a classifier (see
2.21): dua buku 'two books', sebuah rumah 'a house'. They
can also be reduplicated to indicate plurality (see 1.14):
buku-buku 'books', pendapat-pendapat 'opinions'.
Non-count nouns cannot be preceded by a number or
classifier or be reduplicated to indicate plurality. They refer
to processes, substances and the like (either concrete or
abstract), rather than individual items: air 'water', gula 'sugar',
nasi 'rice', hujan 'rain', keadilan 'justice'. Although not
countable, concrete non-count nouns can be preceded by
certain quantifiers (see 2.27ff): sekilo gula 'a kilo of sugar',
dua piring nasi 'two plates of rice'.
Some non-count nouns can be used as count nouns when the
context makes it clear that a certain measure or amount is
being referred to. Thus kopi 'coffee' is a non-count noun but
if, in a restaurant for instance, one asks for dua kopi 'two
coffees', it is clear that what one means is dua cangkir/gelas
kopi 'two cups/glasses of coffee'.
2.4       A noun can occur alone in a phrase, in which case
the phrase consists solely of its head word. The following
construction, a clause, consists of two noun phrases, one the
subject and one the predicate, each phrase consisting of a
single noun:
   Ali guru.
   Ali is a teacher.","[155, 156, 157]"
"Untuk clauses
3.113 A basic clause obligatorily loses its subject when it
becomes an untuk clause, as the subject is always identical
with some component of the main clause within which the
untuk clause occurs. Untuk clauses can occur as subject,
predicate and complement.
As well as not having a subject, an untuk clause allows very
few predicate components; in addition to the verb only tidak
is at all frequent:
    Dia memutuskan untuk tidak menolong mereka.
    He decided not to help them.
3.114 Occurring as predicate an untuk clause is frequently
preceded by a copula. This is further discussed, with an
example, in section 3.6.
3.115 Occurring as subject an untuk clause usually follows
the predicate (see 3.45). The English translation frequently
has an 'anticipatory 'it' subject , as discussed in section 3.112:
                               1   Penting sekali bagi negara-negara Arab untuk
   memelihara hubungan dengan Iran.
   It is very important for the Arab countries to maintain
   relations with Iran.
   Tidak semudah itu untuk mengubah sikap penduduk.
   It isn't as easy as that to change the attitude of the people.
Untuk can be omitted when the untuk clause occurs as
subject, in which case the clause becomes a simple nominal
clause (see 3.143):
   Untuk mencari pekerjaan di kota tidak begitu mudah.
   To find work in the city isn't very easy.
   Mencari pekerjaan di kota tidak begitu mudah.
   Finding work in the city isn't very easy.
3.116 An untuk clause can occur as complement of
transitive and intransitive verbs to indicate an action which
occurs after the action of the main verb:
   Mereka bersedia untuk menurunkan harga.
   They are prepared to lower prices.
   Pemberontak berencana untuk melancarkan operasi
   baru.
   The rebels plan to launch a new operation
   Mereka dipanggil untuk mengambil bagian.
   They were called to take part.
   Pemerintah mengizinkan dia untuk menghadiri sidang.
   The government permitted him to attend the session.
 Untuk can always be omitted, in which case the complement
functions like the verbal complements discussed in sections
3.73 and 3.76. The last example above can also be:
   Pemerintah mengizinkan dia menghadiri sidang.
   The government permitted him to attend the session.
The likelihood of untuk occurring depends on a number of
factors. When the clause is a complement untuk rarely occurs
following some main verbs, such as mencoba 'try', while it is
rarely absent after some other verbs, such as memutuskan
'decide':
   Saya mencoba (untuk) merokok Dji Sam Soe.
   I tried to smoke Dji Sam Soe cigarettes.
   Saya memutuskan untuk pergi.
   I decided to go.
3.117 Some transitive verbs have no object but are directly
followed by an untuk complement. This occurs when the
subject of the complement verb is identical with the subject of
the main verb:
   Dia mengelak untuk menjawab langsung.
   He avoided answering directly.
   Menteri memutuskan untuk memberitahu para
   wartawan*
   The minister decided to tell the journalists.
   Dia menolak untuk menyebutkan jumlah pesawat yang
   diperlukan.
   He refused to state the number of planes which were
   required.
Untuk is also optional in this situation:
  Dia mengelak menjawab langsung.
  He avoided answering directly.
In such constructions the untuk clause must be regarded as a
complement and not an object because the main verb cannot
be transformed to a passive. However, the complement verb
can be passive; the two verbs still have the same subject:
   Dia menolak untuk diperiksa oleh mereka.
   He refused to be investigated by them.
3.118 Untuk also occurs as a conjunction before a
subordinate clause of purpose (see 4.74). In this function it
cannot be omitted.","[322, 323, 324]"
"      This example is from Lapoliwa (1990: 202).
   The Prime Minister was urged by the people to take firm
   steps.
What is expressed as object of the main clause can
alternatively be expressed as subject of the complement
clause; in this case the supaya/agar clause becomes object of
the main clause, as discussed in section 3.125.
3.123 Supaya/agar can be omitted, although with manj
intransitive verbs the construction is awkward without it.
When the conjunction is omitted a transitive verb is followed
by an object and object complement, as discussed in section
3.76:
   Suwono menyuruh anaknya (supaya) pergi ke sekolah.
   Suwono ordered his children to go to school.
3.124 A Supaya/agar clause can be the object of a
transitive verb under two conditions: when the original object
is ellipted (see 3.125), or when it is reinterpreted as a recipient
phrase (see 3.126).
3.125 When occurring as complement of a transitive verb
the subject of the supaya/agar clause is usually ellipted, as
discussed in section 3.122. Alternatively, the object of the
main clause can be ellipted, in which case the subject of the
supaya/agar clause is retained. The main verb is then
immediately followed by the supaya/agar clause:
   Dia menginstruksikan agar sopir membawa tamunya ke
   hotel.
   He instructed the driver to take his guests to the hotel.
   Rukman mengingatkan agar anak buahnya tidak
   menembak.
   Rukman warned his men not to shoot.
   Leo menyerukan agar rakyat punya keberanian
   mengadu.
   Leo appealed for the people to have the courage to
   complain.
In constructions such as those above the supaya/agar clause
is the object of the main verb. It can thus become subject of a
passive construction, as illustrated in section 3.127.
3.126 The original object of the main clause can be
reinterpreted as a recipient, introduced by kepada 'to . In this
                                                      1case the supaya/agar clause is no longer a complement but is
reinterpreted as object. It always follows the recipient phrase
and its subject is ellipted, being the same as the recipient. In
the first example below -nya is shown both as object and as
recipient:
   Dokter menganjurkannya supaya berobat di Australia.
   Dokter menganjurkan kepadanya supaya berobat di
   Australia.
   The doctor urged him to get medical treatment in
   Australia.
   Mereka menghimbau kepada Presiden Soeharto agar
   mencabut keputusan Menteri Penerangan.
   They appealed to President Soeharto to revoke the
   decision of the Minister of Information.
3.127 As subject a supaya/agar clause invariable occurs in
a passive clause. It almost always follows other nuclear
components of the clause:
   Diserukan agar dilancarkan aksi-aksi protes
   internasional di semua pusat operasi perusahaan itu.
   It was urged that international protest actions be launched
   in all centres of operation of the company.
   Disarankannya agar mereka dikawinkan.
   She advised that they be married.
3.128 If the verb of the supaya/agar clause is negated
either jangan or tidak can occur. Although use of tidak is
historically the newer form it is preferred by many people:
   Saya minta supaya saudara tidak/jangan pergi.
   I request that you don't go/I ask you not to go.
3.129 When the subject of a supaya/agar clause is ellipted,
as discussed in 3.122, the clause has no subject and hence
supaya/agar can be replaced by untuk (see 3.113):
   Saya dapat mengusulkan kepada pimpinan untuk/supaya
   menerima saudara.
   I can suggest to the leaders to accept you.
   Hasan Basrie mendesak pemerintah untuk memperkuat
   sensor terhadap film kekerasan.
   Hasan Basrie urged the government to toughen censorship
   against violent movies.
If a subject occurs supaya cannot be replaced by untuk:
    Saya dapat mengusulkan kepada pimpinan supaya
    mereka menerima saudara»
    I can suggest to the leaders that they accept you.","[325, 326, 327, 328]"
"Identifying clauses
3.92 An identifying construction is another method of
focusing attention on a particular element of a clause.
Identifying clauses correspond to what are called cleft
sentences in English, although their structure is quite
different. The following clause is a neutral statement:
   Orang itu mencuri dompet saya.
   That person stole my wallet.
If we want to call attention to orang itu 'that person', to make
it clear that it was he and not someone else who was involved,
we can make it the predicate. The rest of the clause,
beginning with yang, becomes a nominalised relative clause
(see 3.131) and acts as subject. Because the predicate occurs
before the subject it is foregrounded or highlighted (see
3.42-4) and can be marked by foregrounding particle -lah
(see 3.51).
    Orang itulah yang mencuri dompet saya.
    It was that person who stole my wallet.
Such clauses can be translated by cleft sentences, as in the
above example, or by constructions like 'That person is the
one who stole my wallet'. Identifying clauses are far more
frequent in Indonesian than cleft sentences in English where,
at least in speech, it is more common simply to stress the first
word of the phrase: 'That person stole my wallet'. The
identifying clause in Indonesian is also accompanied by extra
stress on the first phrase. In addition, a rising intonation
identifies the first phrase as the predicate. While
foregrounding particle -lah is common in identifying clauses
it is not obligatory:
    Wayang kulitlah yang paling kami gemari.
    It is the wayang kulit that we most admire.
    Faktor politiklah yang terutama mempengaruhi hukum.
    It is political factors which most influence the law.
    Hadi yang berangkat tadi.
    It was Hadi who left just now.
The predicate can be a personal pronoun or, as occurs
commonly, a demonstrative pronoun:
  Inilah yang paling lezat, sehat dan segar.
  It is this which is most delicious, healthy and fresh.
As the predicate is a noun phrase it is negated by bukan:
   Bukan saya yang selalu terlambat.
   It isn't me who's always late.
3.93 Many Indonesians do not allow question words
siapa 'who' and apa 'what' to be the subject of a basic passive
clause. Instead they must occur in identifying constructions.
This is discussed in section 4.16.
3.94 The order of subject and predicate cannot be
reversed in an identifying clause; reversal of order produces a
basic clause in which the subject is a nominalised relative
clause (see 3.131-2). In each of the pairs of constructions
below the first is an identifying clause, which has rising
intonation on the predicate, while the second is a basic clause,
with normal intonation pattern:
   Pakaian yang saya beli.
   It was clothes that I bought.
   Yang saya beli pakaian.
   What I bought was clothes.
   Pak Hasjim(lah) yang mendirikan sekolah itu.
   It was Mr Hasjim who founded that school.
   Yang mendirikan sekolah itu (adalah) Pak Hasjim.
   The one who founded that school was Mr Hasjim.","[309, 310, 311]"
"Specific Questions
4.14 These questions do not seek 'yes' or 'no' as an answer
but require specific information. Specific questions contain a
question word, or interrogative, corresponding to one of the
'wh-' words in English. These are:
   apa what
   siapa who
   (di/ke/dari) mana where (at/to/from)
   (yang) mana which
   kapan, bila when
   apabila, bila(mana) when
   bagaimana how
   berapa how many, how much
   keberapa which number
   mengapa, kenapa why
   untuk apa why, what for
Specific questions usually have the same word order as
corresponding statements. In the sentences below apa and
siapa are objects. Both occur after the verb, in the normal
position for an object in a statement. In English the question
word must be placed first in the sentence:
   Anda membaca apa?
   What are you reading?
   Dia menemui siapa?
   Who did he meet?
However, if the question word is predicate it often precedes
the subject (see also examples at the end of 4.16):
   Siapa dia?
   Who is he?
   Bagaimana jalan itu?
   What is that road like?
Siapa and apa
4.15 These are interrogative pronouns, occurring in the
same positions as nouns. They can thus occur as components
of a clause, as in the first two examples in section 4.14.
They can also occur within a noun phrase. Modifying a noun
apa asks 'what':
  Buku/hari/film apa ini?
  What book/day/movie is this?
As a question word apa must be distinguished from the
question marker discussed in section 4.7.
Following a noun siapa is possessive, meaning 'whose':
   Anak siapa ini?
   Whose child is this?
 Siapa is an independent phrase if it does not follow a noun.
 In the following example it is the predicate of an interrogative
 clause and can be contrasted with the sentence above:
    Siapa anak ini?
    Who is this child?
 To ask about the name of a person siapa is used:
    Siapa nama orang itu?
   What is that person's name?
 For anything other than a person apa is used:
    Apa nama kota itu?
    What is the name of that town?
Apa and siapa can follow prepositions. In English a
preposition can precede 'who' and 'what' at the beginning of a
clause, although this only occurs in formal style; usually the
preposition is placed at the end of the sentence. In
Indonesian siapa and apa cannot be separated from a
preceding preposition:
   Ibu memberi buku itu kepada siapa?
   Who did mother give the book to?
   Anda membeli buku ini untuk siapa?
   Who did you buy this book for?
   Dia menulis dengan apa?
   What did he write with?
The preposition plus question word can occur first for
emphasis; here also they cannot be separated:
  Dengan siapa dia menonton?
  Who did she go to the pictures with?
 4.16 Apa and siapa cannot occur as subject of a passive
- clause. Instead, the construction is changed to an identifying
 clause (see 3.92), with the question word as predicate. The
 question word is then followed by yang, which introduces the
 subject:
     Apa yang dibicarakan di rapat?
     What was discussed at the meeting?
     Siapa yang kauundang?
   Who did you invite? (literally: Who was the one you
   invited?)
Further, the subject of a passive clause cannot be a noun
phrase containing siapa or apa, the same change being
required here also:
   Film apa yang kamu tonton?
   What movie did you see?
   Sepeda siapa yang dicuri?
   Whose bike was stolen?
Although some Indonesians allow the interrogatives to be
subject of an active verb, many people always use an
identifying construction here also:    1   Siapa yang menulis buku ini?
   Who wrote this book?
   Apa yang dapat menyebabkan sakit perut?
   What can cause stomach ache?
Non-verbal clauses are also transformed into identifying
constructions:
   Siapa yang marah?
   Who is angry?
   Apa yang enak?
   What is delicious?
The only exception to the occurrence of a nominalised
subject is if it is already a noun or pronoun. The
interrogative predicate freely occurs before or after the
subject:
   Apa ini?/Ini apa?
   What is this?
   Siapa orang itu?/Orang itu siapa?
   Who is that person?","[342, 343, 344, 345]"
"Noun phrases in apposition
2.61 When two noun phrases occur one after the other
and refer to the same person or thing they are in apposition.
The second noun phrase gives further information about the
first, and is called the defining appositional phrase. The two
phrases are usually separated in writing by a comma and in
speech by a slight pause between them. In the first example
below Ola and suaminya 'her husband' are two noun phrases
referring to the same person; the second gives information
about the first:
    Dia menantikan Ola, suaminya.
    She awaited Ola, her husband.
    Ini namanya Monas, Monumen Nasional.
    This is called Monas, the National Monument.
    Pertunjukan lain adalah ketoprak, sandiwara tradisional
    dengan cerita dari sejarah dan dongeng-dongeng.
    Another show is the ketoprak, a traditional play with stories
    from history and legend.
The defining appositional phrase can itself be followed by a
defining phrase. In the following example the defining
phrase gives information about Pak Trimo. The defining
phrase itself is followed by a defining phrase giving
information about Banyusumurup:
   Ini Pak Trimo, seorang penduduk di Banyusumurup,
   sebuah desa di lereng Gunung Kidul.
   This is Mr Trimo, a resident of Banyusumurup, a village
   on the slope of Mount Kidul.
The defining noun phrase can sometimes occur before the
main phrase. In this case a comma is not placed between the
two in writing:
   Suaminya Ola masih belum pulang.
   Her husband Ola still hadn't returned home.
   Petenis Amerika Agassi maju ke perempat final.
   The American tennis player Agassi advanced to the quarter
   final.
2.62 The apposition can be made explicit by occurrence
of ya'itu or yakni 'that is' before the defining noun phrase:
   Camat wilayah itu, yakni Pak Sitepu, berkerabat dengan
   saya.
   The district camat, that is Mr Sitepu, was a relative of mine.
   Di sebelah barat Parangtritis terdapat sebuah tempat
   wisata lagi, ya'itu Pantai Samas.
   To the west of Parangtritis is another tourist spot, that is
   Samas Beach.
2.63 A second type of apposition requires an adjunct
before the second noun phrase. The second phrase then
exemplifies the first in some way, as specified by the adjunct.
Adjuncts which can precede the second noun phrase include:
   misalnya, umpamanya for example
   terutama especially
   termasuk including
   seperti such as
   Beberapa pengarang, misalnya Umar Kayam, pernah
   memberi kuliah di sana.
   Several writers, for instance Umar Kayam, have given
   lectures there.
   Makam Rara Mendut dan Pranacitra ramai diziarahi
   orang, terutama para pedagang.
   The graves of Rara Mendut and Pranacitra are visited by
   large numbers of people, especially merchants.
   Brigjen. Sabur kemudian datang ke Halim dan
   melaporkan tewasnya para jenderal, termasuk A. Yani.
   Brigadier General Sabur then came to Halim and reported
   the deaths of the generals, including A. Yani.
   Ide-idenya diperkenalkan di kota-kota besar, seperti
   Jakarta, Bandung, Surabaya dan Yogyakarta.
   His ideas were introduced in the large cities, such as
   Jakarta, Bandung, Surabaya and Yogyakarta.","[185, 186, 187]"
"Yes-No Questions
4.5      Questions which seek the answer 'yes' or 'no' are yes-
no questions:
   Kamu lapar? Are you hungry?
   Tidak. No.
(The answer might not be a simple positive or negative; there
are many other responses, such as k a d a n g - k a d a n g
'sometimes , mungkin 'possibly , and so on.)
          1                    1
Yes-no questions are spoken with interrogative intonation,
fnarked by a rise in final pitch, and written with a final
question mark. Frequently intonation (a question mark in
writing) is the only difference between a statement, marked by
a fall in final pitch, and a yes-no question:
   Sri sudah pulang.
   Sri has gone home.
   Sri sudah pulang?
   Has Sri gone home?
   Dia guru.
   He is a teacher.
   Dia guru?
   Is he a teacher?
4.6     A yes-no question does not usually have a different
word order from the corresponding statement. However, if
boleh occurs it usually precedes the subject:
   Boleh saya masuk?
   May I come in?
4.7       A yes-no question can be made overtly interrogative
by placing apa or apakah before it. This is more common in
writing and formal speech:
   Apa ini hari Selasa?
   Is this Tuesday?
   Apakah dia guru?
   Is she a teacher?
In this context apa(kah), which is here called a question
marker, has no lexical function but simply signals that what
follows is a question. It must be distinguished from the
question word apa 'what? (see 4.15):
   Apa dia sudah makan?
   Has she eaten?
   Dia sudah makan apa?
   What has she eaten?
The first sentence above contains the question marker apa,
which can be omitted:
  Dia sudah makan?
  Has she eaten?
In the second sentence apa 'what' is the object of the verb and
cannot be omitted.
4.8      If question marker apa does not occur -kah can be
attached to another word to signal that the construction is a
question, that word usually being placed first in the clause:
    Sudahkah dia makan? Has she eaten?
Use of -kah is discussed in section 4.23-6.
Bukan as sentence tag
4.9      Bukan can be attached to a statement to turn it into a
question. Bukan then corresponds to a sentence tag with 'be',
'have or 'do in English. This is usually used either when the
     1      1speaker, uncertain as to the truth of the statement, seeks
confirmation or, when knowing the statement to be correct,
seeks agreement from the addressee:
   Saudara mahasiswa, bukan?
   You are a student, aren't you?
   Pesawat berangkat jam lima, bukan?
   The plane leaves at five, doesn't it?
   Dia sudah makan, bukan?
   She has eaten, hasn't she?
As the above examples show, bukan is used in this way even if
the construction would usually be negated with tidak or
belum.
Bukan can occur as tag to a negative sentence:
  Saudara tidak punya surat jalan, bukan?
  You don't have a travel document, do you?
Bukan occurs first in the sentence if -kah is attached to it (see
4.25).
4.10 Informally bukan may be replaced by kan, but only
when the speaker is seeking agreement from the addressee to
a situation the speaker knows to be correct. Kan often comes
before the predicate, rather than at the end of the sentence:
   Gajinya lumayan, kan?
   Gajinya kan lumayan?
   The salary is pretty good, isn't it?
Ya as sentence tag
4.11 In informal speech y a can occur as a sentence tag.
Like bukan it turns a statement into a question, which invites
confirmation or agreement from the listener. This also allows
the speaker to avoid the impression of making a firm
assertion:
   Dia cantik, ya?
   She's pretty, isn't she?
   Film itu bagus, ya?
   That movie was great, eh?
Ya also occurs in imperatives (see 4.42).
Alternative possibility yes-no questions
4.12 The alternative possibility can be indicated by
attaching atau plus a negative, meaning 'or not', to a yes-no
question. The negative following atau is the same as would
occur if the preceding part of the question were negated:
   Apakah anda mau ikut, atau tidak?
   Do you want to come, or not?
   Ini jalan ke Rawamangun, atau bukan?
   Is this the road to Rawamangun, or not?
   Mereka sudah pulang, atau belum?
   Have they gone home yet, or not?
Responses to yes-no questions
4.13 A yes-no question can be answered by a positive
response, such as ya 'yes', betul 'correct'. This may be
followed by a full sentence:
   Q: Siti cantik?
         Is Siti pretty?
   A: Ya, (dia cantik).
         Yes, (she is).
Frequently a positive response is with a word which occurred
in the question. The most common of such words are sudah,
boleh, mau:
   Q: Anda sudah makan?
         Have you eaten?
   A: Sudah.
         Yes (literally: Already).
   Q: Boleh saya masuk?
         May I come in?
   A: Boleh.
         Yes (literally: (You) may).
Responses are further discussed in section 4.118.
A negative response to a positive question is with the
appropriate negative word:
   Q: Anda sudah makan?
         Have you eaten yet?
   A: Belum.
         Not yet.
If a yes-no question contains a negative it is agreed to by a
positive response, such as ya 'yes , betul 'correct', where 'no'
                                   1would occur in English. In a full response this is then
followed by a sentence containing a negative:
   Q: Anda tidak minum kopi?
          You don't drink coffee?
   A: Ya, (saya tidak minum kopi).
          No, (I don't drink coffee).
   Q: Kamu belum mengisi formulir, bukan?
          You haven't filled in the form yet, have you?
   A: Ya, (saya belum mengisi formulir).
         No, (I haven't filled the form in yet).
Although a tag question is always formed with bukan, a
negative response uses the appropriate negative word, bukan
if the predicate is a noun, belum if the predicate contains
sudah, and tidak elsewhere:
    Q: Anda lapar, bukan?
         You're hungry, aren't you?
    A: Tidak.
         No.","[338, 339, 340, 341, 342]"
"Sentence Linkers
4.98 Sentence linkers, sometimes called linking adjuncts,
are similar to conjunctions. However, instead of linking one
clause to another within a sentence, they link two sentences, at
the same time indicating the kind of connection there is
between the two sentences. In the following example namun
'nevertheless' is the sentence linker. It indicates that the
situation in the second sentence occurs in spite of what is
stated in the first sentence:
    Mereka tahu dia menderita penyakit lepra. Namun,
    mereka tidak takut.
    They know he has leprosy. Nevertheless, they are not
    afraid.
There are a large number of sentence linkers, describing a
variety of relationships between two sentences. Some of the
more common linkers are listed in sections 4.99-104. Some
linkers also function as conjunctions and so are discussed in
sections 4.70-9 as well.
While a linker usually comes first in the sentence this is not
always the case; it can occur within the main clause of the
sentence. In the following example the second sentence
consists of a clause and the linking adjunct malahan
'moreover'. The linker follows kadang-kadang 'sometimes',
which is a time adjunct within the clause:
   Di rumah sering diadakan pesta. Kadang-kadang,
   malahan, mereka mendatangkan band dan penyanyi-
   penyanyi.
   In the house parties are often held. Sometimes, moreover,
   they bring in a band and singers.
Linkers indicating an addition
4.99 The second sentence can contain a related comme it
to the first sentence or information which reinforces the first
sentence. Linkers include:
   lagi pula further, what's more
   di samping itu besides that
   juga also
   selain itu besides that, apart from that
   kecuali itu besides that
   selanjutnya further
   bahkan moreover, even
   apalagi moreover, besides
   malah, malahan moreover, what's more
   Sejak kecil penduduk Bangunarjo mengalami hidup di
   lingkungan yang sehat dan teratur. Selain itu, oleh desa
   dikembangkan pula usaha di bidang industri rumah,
   seperti pertenunan.
   From childhood the people of Bangunarjo have known life
   in a healthy and orderly environment. Besides that, efforts
   in the area of home industry, such as weaving, have also
   been developed by the village.
   Anak itu memang nakal. Bahkan ibunya sendiri pernah
   ditipunya.
   That child is certainly naughty. He has even deceived his
   own mother.
   Ia tidak mau masuk sekolah. Lagi pula, ia tidak mau
   belajar di rumah.
   He doesn't want to go to school. What's more, he doesn't
   want to study at home.
Linkers indicating contrast
4.100 The second sentence can contrast in some way with
the first sentence, sometimes indicating that the action of the
second sentence occurs despite what is stated in the first
sentence. Linkers include:
   namun, namun demikian despite that, nevertheless
   walaupun demikian, namun begitu despite that,
       nevertheless
   meskipun demikian, meskipun begitu despite that,
       nevertheless
   biarpun demikian, biarpun begitu despite that,
       nevertheless
   tetapi, akan tetapi but, nevertheless, still
   sebaliknya on the contrary, on the other hand
   malah, malahan, bahkan instead, on the contrary
   bagaimanapun (juga) however that might be
   Kami tidak sependapat dengan dia. Biarpun begitu,
   kami tidak akan menghalanginya.
   We don't agree with him. Despite that, we will not prevent
   him.
   Penyakitnya sudah telanjur dibiarkan. Meskipun
   demikian, dengan berobat penderitaannya dapat
   dikurangi.
   His disease has been left too long. Despite that, with
   medication his suffering can be reduced.
   Keadaan memang sudah mulai aman. Akan tetapi, kita
   harus tetap waspada.
   The situation has begun to calm down. Nevertheless, we
   must remain alert.
   Yang dilepas itu justru yang kelas kakap. Yang kecil-
   kecil malah ditahan.
   It was the big shots who were released. The small fry
   instead were detained.
   Barangkali engkau berhelat dengan alasan bahwa ayah
   keras kepala. Bagaimanapun juga, kau telah salah
   melangkah.
   Perhaps you are using the excuse that father is being
   obstinate. However that may be, you have acted wrongly.
The contrast shown in the second sentence may be
strengthened in several ways, such as by use of juga 'also,
anyway':
    Dia tidak belajar. Namun, dia lulus ujian juga.
    He didn't study. Nevertheless, he passed the exam anyway.
The linkers malah, malahan and bahkan also mean
'moreover' (see 4.99 and the example of malahan in 4.98).
Meaning 'instead, on the contrary' they usually follow a
negative sentence:
   Anjingnya tidak diberi makan. Malahan dilempari.
   The dog wasn't given food. On the contrary, it was pelted.
   Mereka tidak bekerja. Mereka bahkan bermain kartu.
   They didn't work. Instead, they played cards.
Linkers indicating a consequence
4.101 The second sentence can indicate something which is
a consequence of what is stated in the first sentence. Linkers
include:
   akibatnya as a result, consequently
   alhasil, walhasil the result is, consequently
   jadi thus, therefore
   maka consequently, thus, so
   maka dari itu as a result of that
   makanya consequently, no wonder
   oleh karena itu therefore, because of that
   oleh sebab itu therefore, because of that
   Gino sudah besar. Maka dia punya buku tabungan
   sendiri.
   Gino is grown up. So he has his own savings book.
   Tempat itu licin. Makanya kamu jatuh.
   That place is slippery. No wonder you fell.
   Sopir mereka, Rudy, melihat massa mendekat sambil
   melempari mobil yang mereka tumpangi. Walhasil,
   Rudy langsung tancap gas.
   Their driver, Rudy, saw a mob approaching and pelting the
   vehicle they were in. As a result, Rudy immediately put his
   foot down.
4.102 The first sentence may indicate something which is a
consequence of the second sentence. Linkers include:
   soalnya the thing is; this is because
   habis the reason being, what else could one expect, how
      else could it be
   maklum(lah) bear in mind; this is understandable since
   Suasana di kantor itu sudah tegang. Soalnya, kantor itu
   terus-terusan menerima ancaman melalui telepon.
   The atmosphere in the office was tense. The thing is, the
   office was continually receiving threats by telephone.
   Ini memang bukan air minum. Habis, dipakai untuk
   segala macam kebutuhan.
   This certainly isn't drinking water. The reason is, it is used
   for all sorts of purposes.
   Antara 1853 dan 1858 jemaah haji yang pulang ke
   Hindia Belanda tidak sampai separuh dari yang
   berangkat. Maklum, hingga tahun 1930-an, sekitar
   sepuluh persen jemaah Indonesia meninggal di Tanah
   Suci karena sakit.
   Between 1853 and 1858 less than half those who set off on
   the pilgrimage returned to Netherlands East Indies. Bear
   in mind, until the 1930s about ten percent of pilgrims died
   in the Holy Land from illness.
Linkers indicating an example
4.103 The second sentence presents an example of what is
mentioned in the first sentence. Linkers include:
   misalnya for example, for instance
   umpamanya for example, for instance
   Buah-buahan makanan yang sehat. Umpamanya, buah
   mangga dan buah semangka mengandung banyak
   vitamin A.
   Fruit is healthy food. For example, mangos and
   watermelon contain a lot of vitamin A.
Linkers indicating a time sequence
4.104 A number of linking adjuncts indicate that the action
of the second sentence takes place before, after, or at the same
time as the action of the first sentence. Linkers include:
   kemudian afterwards, later
   sesudah itu after that
   sebelumnya, sebelum itu beforehand, before that
   sementara itu in the meantime, at the same time
   lalu, lantas then
   Orang tuanya berbelanja ke Glodok. Sesudah itu,
   mereka pergi ke Ancol.
   Her parents went shopping at Glodok. After that they went
   to Ancol.
   Tahun lalu mereka pindah ke Jakarta* Sebelumnya,
   mereka tinggal di Bandung.
   Last year they moved to Jakarta. Before that they lived in
   Bandung.","[385, 386, 387, 388, 389, 390]"
"Direct quote clauses
3.95 Some verbs report what someone said. The object of
such verbs, or the complement if they are intransitive (see
3.61), is a direct quote, sometimes called direct speech. In
writing this is placed within quotation marks and is usually
preceded by a comma:
   Dia berkata, ""Terima kasih"".
   He said, ""Thank you"".
   Dewi menjawab, ""Betul"".
   Dewi replied, ""That is correct"".
These clauses are here called direct quote clauses. A person's
words can also be indirectly quoted, as discussed in section
3.111.
3.96 As well as basic direct quote clauses there are derived
direct quote clauses. In these the direct speech is placed first
in the clause for emphasis. The subject and verb of the basic
clause are replaced by a quote noun phrase, which consists of
a quote noun and a possessor. The quote noun consists of the
base of the verb in the corresponding basic clause and the
possessor corresponds to the subject of the basic clause. The
quote noun phrase corresponds to a subject and verb in
English. The constructions derived from the basic quote
clauses in section 3.95 are:
   MTerima kasih"", katanya.
   ""Thank you"", he said.
   ""Betul"", jawab Dewi.
   ""That is correct"", replied Dewi.
The direct speech can be anything from a single word to a
long construction. It can be a question, command, or
exclamation, as well as a statement. For each of the following
examples the subject and verb of the corresponding basic
clause are also given:
   ""Saya diperlakukan tak adil"", teriak terhukum.
   [Terhukum berteriak, "".v.]
   ""I've been treated unjustly"", shouted the sentenced man.
   ""Siapa itu?"" tanyaku. [Aku bertanya, ""...]
   ""Who is that?"" I asked.
   ""Saya sudah mengundang dia"", tambahnya.
   [Dia menambahkan, ""...]
   Tve already invited him"", he added.
   ""Diusulkan agar saya belajar di Belanda"", lanjut
   Kristiyanto.
   [Kristiyanto melanjutkan, ""...]
   ""It was suggested that I study in Holland"", continued
   Kristiyanto.
The direct speech can be broken up, with the quote noun
phrase being inserted within the two parts of the quote:
   ""Kalau gajinya tidak cukup"", ujarnya, ""jangan bekerja
 - di sana"".
   ""If the salary isn't enough"", he said, ""don't work there"".
Some other quote nouns are the following, with -nya 'he'
given as possessor:
   gerutunya he grumbled     tegasnya he asserted
   jelasnya he explained     pikirnya he thought
   ceritanya he related      ucapnya he pronounced
   sahutnya he responded          bentaknya he snapped
   tulisnya he wrote              guraunya he joked
The quote noun phrase may be followed by a number of
other clause components, such as prepositional phrases
indicating who was spoken to, the manner in which it was said,
and so on:
   ""Ke sini!"", bisiknya kepadaku.
   ""Here!"" he whispered to me.
   ""Kami masih berteman"", ujarnya dengan lemah-lembut.
   ""We're still friends"", she said softly.
   ""Itu bukan maksudku"", katanya sambil tersenyum.
   ""That's not what I meant"", she said while smiling.","[311, 312, 313]"
"      Lapoliwa (1990: 204) states that retention of meN- in a negative
      imperative with a specific object makes it a weaker command»
      While many Indonesians regard meN- as optional in negative
      imperatives with a specific object, e.g. Kaswanti Purwo (1986.
      163), some writers, e.g. Dardjowidjojo (1978: 169), treat it as
      obligatorily present and some, e.g. Johns (1978: 112), treat it as
      obligatorily absent.
      These examples are based on Johns (1978: 112, 114).
   Jangan mencuci sekarang! (Kita harus pergi nanti.)
   Don't wash now/Don't do any washing now! (We have to
   go soon.)
Jangan is emphasised by sekali-kali:
  Jangan sekali-kali melanggar peraturan ini!
  Never disobey this rule!
Constructions with jangan kita 'let's not' are mentioned in
section 4.54.
Passive imperatives
4.36 An imperative with a transitive verb can be expressed
in the passive, with prefix di-. As such a verb cannot occur in
a statement with a second person agent (see 3.27) this
construction contains a suggestion of being directed not at the
addressee but at a third person. It is thus more indirect and
consequently less forceful than an imperative with an active
verb, containing a sense of 'it is to be done', rather than 'you
do it', although this is not always reflected in the translations
of the following examples:
   Barang itu ditaruh di sini saja!
   Just put those things here.
   Diangkat, jangan diseret!
   Lift it, don't drag it!
In a negative construction the subject can either precede
jangan or follow the predicate:
   Jendela ini jangan dibuka!
   Jangan dibuka jendala ini!
   This window is not to be opened!
4.37 Prohibitions are expressed as passives, for instance
with dilarang '(it is) forbidden'. While these are structurally
statements their intention is imperative:
   Dilarang masuk.
   No entry.
   Dilarang menyalahkan api.
   Lighting fires is prohibited.
Addressee in imperatives
4.38 Although the addressee is not usually mentioned in
imperatives it can be. In Classical Malay it was expressed in
an agent phrase, olehmu 'by you':
   Tangkaplah olehmu Sang Tomo, hai Bima!
   Seize Tomo, o Bima!
This form occurs today only in literary and archaic usage:
   Pujilah olehmu Allah yang maharahim!
   Praise God the most merciful!
   MBacalah olehmu sendiri ini, Jan"", kataku pada
   Dapperste.
   ""Read this yourself, Jan"", I said to Dapperste.     4
With jangan the addressee can be expressed by a pronoun
placed before the verb:
   Jangan kamu (mem)baca surat ini!
   Don't you read this letter!
Pronoun objects
4.39 Bound pronouns (see 2.71) cannot occur as objects
of verbs in imperative constructions; instead full pronouns
must occur:
   Jangan mengganggu aku/dia!
   Don't disturb me/him!
While -nya can occur as object in a statement, corresponding
to unstressed 'it' in English, as in the first sentence below, it
cannot occur in an imperative. Instead the object is not
mentioned if it is clear from context, or, if necessary, is
mentioned in full:
   Saya sudah membacanya.
   I've read it.
   Ini suratnya. Baca!
   This is his letter. Read it!","[353, 354, 355]"
"
     Tatabahasa Baku Bahasa Indonesia (1988: 187) states that
     siapa/apa must always become predicate, the subject being a
     nominalised construction with yang. On the other hand, Johns
     (1978: 139) allows active clauses with the interrogative as subject,
     such as Siapa membeli pakaian? 'Who bought some clothes?'
Mana
4.17 Following a locative preposition (see 2.119) mana
means 'which'. Like siapa and apa (see 4.15), mana cannot
be separated from the preposition, although 'where' usually is
in English:
   Mereka datang dari mana?
   Where do they come from?
   Ke mana mereka membawa barang itu?
   Where are they taking those things?
4.18 Occurring within a noun phrase mana usually
follows yang and asks 'which (out of a known set)':
   Tomo tinggal di rumah yang mana?
   Which house does Tomo live in?
Yang before mana is usually omitted if the following phrase
begins with yang, although it can be retained:
   Pohon mana yang akan ditebang?
   Which tree will be cut down?
   Pasif yang mana yang harus dipakai dalam kalimat ini?
   Which passive must be used in this sentence?
As in the above examples, a noun phrase containing (yang)
mana cannot be the subject of a passive clause; instead the
construction is transformed into an identifying clause (see
3.92), as also occurs if apa or siapa occurs within the noun
phrase (see 4.16).
The phrase orang mana asks about a person's origins:
   Penyanyi itu orang mana?
   Where does that singer come from/What country is that
   singer from?
The phrase yang mana can be nominalised (see 3.131):
  Yang mana mobilmu?
  Which is your car?
Berapa
4.19 Berapa precedes a noun as an indefinite number
meaning 'how many': berapa jam/tahun/orang 'how many
hours/years/people'. It follows a noun to ask 'which, what' if
the answer is a number, that is, if the noun refers to something
belonging to a series in which the members are distinguished
by a number (see 2.15): jam/tahun/kelas/tingkat/halaman
berapa 'what hour (time) /year/ class/ level/ page'. The
difference is illustrated by the following examples:
   Berapa jam mereka tunggu di sini?
   How many hours (how long) did they wait here?
   Jam berapa mereka singgah di sini?
   What time did they call by here?
   Kamu sudah membaca berapa halaman?
   How many pages have you read?
   Kamu membaca halaman berapa?
   What page did you read?
Keberapa
4.20 keberapa 'which number' asks the number in a
sequence of something which is not usually distinguished by
its relative order. The position of such a noun in a series is
identified by an ordinal number (see 2.16). Keberapa is thus
the interrogative ordinal:
    Fatimah istrinya yang keberapa?
    What number wife of his is Fatimah?
Other question words
4.21 Question words of time, reason and manner usually
occur first in the clause:
   Kapan/bila dia akan berangkat ke Jakarta?
   When will he leave for Jakarta?
   Mengapa mereka belum menjawab surat saya?
   Why haven't they replied to my letter yet?
   Bagaimana kotak ini harus dibuka?
   How should this box be opened?
Question word plus saja
4.22 Combinations of a question word followed by saja
when occurring in questions indicate an expectation on the
part of the person asking the question that the answer will
contain reference to more than one thing:
   Andi akan berkunjung ke mana saja?
   Which places will Andi visit?
When asking this the questioner assumes not only that Andi
will go visiting but also that he will go to more than one place.
A typical answer might thus refer to a number of places:
   Dia akan berkunjung ke Aceh, Medan dan Palembang.
   He will visit Aceh, Medan and Palembang.
The following examples illustrate the other common phrases
in this group:
   Apa saja yang dibeli ibu di pasar?
   What things did mother buy at the market?
   Pertunjukan apa saja yang dapat ditonton di sana?
   What shows can be seen there?
   Anda ingin bertemu dengan siapa saja?
   Which people do you wish to meet?
   Anda membaca surat kabar yang mana saja?
   Which newspapers do you read?
   Mahasiswa itu berasal dari mana saja?
   Which places do those students come from?","[345, 346, 347, 348]"

"Adjective clauses
3.9      Adjective phrases (see 2.99) can occur in the
predicate centre:
   Risikonya akan berat sekali.
   The risk will be very great.
   Minuman itu harus dingin.
   The drinks must be cold.
If an adjective clause is negated tidak usually occurs
immediately before the adjective phrase:
   Mencari pekerjaan di kota tidak begitu mudah.
   Looking for work in the city isn't very easy.
Sometimes tidak can occur directly before the adjective. This
is discussed in section 2.104.
3.10 An adjective clause can contain a referent phrase
(see 2.105) and have a simple nominal clause (see 3.143) as
its subject. If the simple nominal clause immediately follows
the referent phrase the referent noun may appear to be the
subject of the nominal clause:
    Sulit bagi kita mencari pekerjaan di kota.
    It is difficult for us getting work in the city.
However, the referent phrase bagi kita 'for us' can be omitted
and the simple nominal clause can either precede the
predicate or be preceded by untuk, these variations showing
that kita 'we' is not acting as subject of the simple nominal
clause. Examples of these constructions are given in section
3.115.
3.11 Adjective clauses containing a referent phrase and
having as subject a simple nominal clause or an untuk clause
bear a transformational relationship to adjective clauses
containing a verbal clause as complement (as discussed in
3.85). The first construction below has bagi saya 'for me' as
a referent phrase within the predicate and (untuk) mengingat
kata-kata baru ini 'to remember these new words' as subject;
the second has kata-kata baru ini 'these new words' as subject
and (untuk) saya ingat 'for me to remember' as complement:
   Sukar bagi saya (untuk) mengingat kata-kata baru ini.
   It is hard for me to remember these new words/
   Remembering these new words is hard for me.
   Kata-kata baru ini sukar (untuk) saya ingat.
   These new words are hard for me to remember.","[263, 264]"
"Adjectives
2.98 An adjective is a word which describes a noun; it tells
something about a person or thing, such as its shape or size
(besar 'big', bulat 'round', gemuk 'fat'), colour (hijau 'green',
hitam 'black'), condition (bersih 'clean', kotor 'dirty', rusak
'broken') or other characteristics (baik 'good', pandai 'clever',
senang 'happy', cantik 'pretty', hati-hati 'careful').
Two adjectives may form a compound (see 1.31). The order
of the two adjectives in such compounds is fixed; the second
word usually acts to strengthen the meaning of the first word,
as in lemah lembut 'gentle'.
A compound may also consist of an adjective and a following
noun. Such forms are idiomatic, such as buta huruf 'illiterate',
keras kepala 'stubborn', panjang tangan 'having a tendency
to steal'.
A compound may consist of a colour term and a following
noun or adjective which makes it more specific: merah tua
'dark red', biru muda 'light blue', hijau daun 'leaf green',
kuning gading 'ivory yellow'.
Two adjectives may be juxtaposed to form a kind of
coordination, without dan 'and' occurring between them. The
order of adjectives in such pairs is fixed, such as tinggi kurus
'tall and thin', tegap gesit 'firm and agile':
    Perawakannya tinggi langsing, pembawaannya tegap
    gesit
    Her figure was tall and slender, her bearing firm and agile.
Other pairs like this include hitam manis 'dark and attractive',
tinggi tegap 'tall and strong', halus mulus 'fine and smooth',
cerdas tangkas 'intelligent and quick-witted'.
Juxtaposed adjectives may also indicate alternatives, atau 'or'
being omitted between them, such as panjang pendek 'long or
short', baik buruk 'good or bad'. Such pairs, written with a
hyphen and followed by -nya, are frequently nominalised
(see 3.139).
A number of verbs can act as adjectives, being able to occur
with many of the components of the adjective phrase, such as
modifying adverbs, lebih 'more', and paling 'most'. These
include membosankan 'boring' and similar forms (see 1.194),
menarik 'attractive', and many of the verbs with prefix ber-
based on nouns (see 1.169ff), such as berbahaya 'dangerous',
berhasil 'successful', berguna 'useful'. The indefinite
numbers banyak 'much' and sedikit 'a little' can also function
in the same way (see examples in 2.113).","[203, 204, 205]"
"     The discussion of reduplicated pronouns, together with examples, is
     adapted from Kaswanti Purwo (1984* 64).
     Reduplication of verbs
    1*19 Unlike nouns, complex verbs do not undergo full
    reduplication. Instead, bases are repeated and affixes then
    attached to them. There are several functions.
    1.20 With some verbs reduplication gives a connotation of
    action done in a casual or leisurely way:
       duduk sit : duduk-duduk sit about
       berjalan walk : berjalan-jalan walk about, go for a stroll
       melihat see : melihat-lihat browse, have a look around
       membuka open : membuka-buka (buku) leaf through (a
          book)
    1.21 With many verbs reduplication indicates continued
     tion, either an action done over a period of time or an
    ac    action performed repeatedly:
       Bu Yem mengurut-urut rambut anaknya.
       Mrs Yem stroked her child's hair (a number of times).
       Potongan kayu itu terapung-apung di atas air.
       The piece of wood floated on the water.
       Dia berteriak-teriak memanggil pelayan.
       He shouted and shouted for the waiter.
       Menteri menunda-nunda keberangkatannya.
       The minister kept delaying his departure,
1*22 With some verbs reduplication gives a meaning
somewhat different from that of the single form, usually
conveying a sense of intensity:
   menjadi become : menjadi-jadi get worse
   meminta request : meminta-minta beg
   membesarkan enlarge : membesar-besarkan exaggerate
   berganti replace : berganti-ganti alternate, keep
                        changing places
1*23 Accompanied by tidak 'not' reduplication of the
yerb can indicate that the action has not occurred, usually
implying that this is contrary to expectation:
   Sudah dua hari Pak Tanto tidak muncul-muncul.
   Mr Tanto hasn't turned up for two days now.
   Perembukan mereka tidak menyinggung-nyinggung
   masalah pemerintah persatuan nasional.
   Their deliberations did not touch on the matter of a
   government of national unity.
1.24 A few verbs, including datang 'come', bangun 'wake
up', pulang 'arrive home', can be reduplicated to function like
correlative clauses introduced by begitu 'no sooner' (see
4.89):
   Bangun-bangun mereka sudah bertengkar.
   No sooner were they awake than they began to argue.
Reduplication of numbers
1.25 This forms adverbs meaning 'in a group of so many':
   Bicaralah satu-satu.
   Speak one at a time.
   Mereka masuk dua-dua.
   They came in two at a time.
The numbers can also be separated by demi or per (see
2.177). Numbers for 'two' to 'four' can also occur with prefix
ber- (see 1.160).","[47, 48, 49]"
