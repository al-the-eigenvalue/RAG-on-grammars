"     Free pronouns may be followed by the determiner eng, as regular nouns may.
But whereas the determiner indicates definiteness in the case of nouns, its
function following pronouns is slightly different. Although related in the
sense that 'given NPs' are potential topics.        Following a pronoun, the
determiner can be best glossed as 'as for':     (26) wo eng       ininou wau imâ            gâs     ende
            he this our      boy younger.brother like thus            'As for him, he is like our younger brother'3.3.1     Possessive pronouns        The possessive pronouns precede the possessed head noun, as in:     (27) yonou munai
           my     house      'my house'The possessor, when identified by means of a noun, precedes the possessive
pronoun. If the possessor noun is itself possessed or modified, it is virtually
a full NP, except that this NP may not be closed off with the determiner eng.
If the possessor noun has the nominal operator eng with it, intonational
features suggest that the possessed item stands in apposition. Let us consider
the following examples :     (28) (a)    man      âib eng, wonou ur      (eng)
                 garden big this its      father (the)                 'this big garden, its owner'
                                         MORPHOLOGY                           55
           (b)   man     âib wonou ur         (eng)
                 garden big its      father (the)                 'the owner of the big garden'           (c)   man     âib ur       (eng)
                 garden big father (the)                 'the owner of the big garden'     In (28) (a) the NP man âib eng has a slightly rising intonation and is
followed by a pause.      I would analyze this example as consisting of two NPs
standing in apposition. The first NP seems to function as Theme.        Strictly
speaking, it is separate from the predication that is being made of wonou ur
'its owner', even though it is relevant to this predication.
     In (28) (b) and (28) (c) we have instances of a single NP, with not much
difference in meaning. This may also be illustrated by the reduction of Yagos
wonou unor 'Yagos his mother' to Yagos unor 'Yagos' mother'. The reduction of a
possessive phrase by eliminating the possessive pronoun seems restricted to
phrases with a kin term as HN. When the possessor is animate and the possessed
item is inanimate, the possessive pronoun is obligatory:    (29) (a)     munon wonou bei
                 man    his    axe         'the man's axe'            (b) *munon bei
                 man   axe3.3.2    Emphatic pronouns and reflexives        Possessive pronouns in Usan are also used in emphatic reference:    (30)     in _âr    wonou   der      qâmâr-a       gas   igub   ig-oun
            we just herself get.up say-3sDS           only hear.SS be-lp.Pr             'We are just hearing herself get up and speak'
56                          STRUCTURES AND THEIR FUNCTIONS IN USAN
     Just as English uses the reflexive pronoun form to express emphatic
reference, Usan uses the possessive pronoun also for reflexives. However, in
this case the possessive pronoun forms a compound with ml 'something': yonomi
'myself', nonomi 'yourself', etc. For example:     (31)   nonomi        dui              qib     igo-ân    ne?
            yourself hand.over.SS go.SS be-2s.Pr and            'You want to kill yourself, huh?'               [When someone walks at
            a dangerous place, e.g. near a precipice]     Plural possessive forms may be reduplicated when expressing reflexivity for
each individual of a particular set:     (32)   munon qei       qob     eng   igub      wurinou-wurinou qâm-amir:.
            man        some talk, this hear.SS their-REDUP            say-3p.FP            'Some men heard that word and each one said to himself:     As emphatic reference, the possessive pronoun may follow                 the    normal   free
pronoun :     (33)   ye yonou âr           qâmb    ig-oum
            I     my      idle say.SS be-ls.Pr            'I myself am just speaking without purpose'The noun git 'body, fruit' may be used instead of the possessive pronoun, as in     (34)   wo git       wonou oau        uber     igo
            he body its           insides good be-3s.Pr            'He himself is at ease'However, it is difficult to ascertain whether wo in (34) is the possessor of git

within one NP, or whether git stands in apposition, as yonou in (33). The
reason is that possession may also be expressed with regular free pronouns, as
(35) illustrates.    (35) ye wau     eng   is-orei
           I   child this descend-3s.FP           'My child has gone down'3.3.3   Social distance in pronominal reference     In 1.1.2.2 we have seen that the Usan society is characterized by a general
reluctance to use proper names. There is an outright taboo on the use of proper
names with respect to affinal relations, such as mund 'in-law of same
generation', ya-ga 'my father-in-law',      inemi   'mother-in-law'.    Singular
referents who stand in one of these relationships to ego have to be addressed
with the second person plural pronoun an. Similarly, when individuals of these
categories are referred to, the third person plural pronoun wuri has to be used.
     According to Head (1978), such variation in number is the most widespread
device by which languages signal respect or social distance, as for example in a
number of European languages (Dutch, German, French, etc). It has also been
recorded for the Highlands language Kobon (Davies 1981:153). As in Kobon, Usan
predicates agree in number when the plural pronoun that refers to a singular
referent is the subject.      Comrie (1975) has shown that the more verb-like a
predicate is, the more likely it is to agree with the features of the surface
subject rather than with the real world number of its referent. In Usan, number
is only marked on verbs, not on adjectives or nouns, so that more detailed
comparison with Comrie's hierarchy is not possible.
     The rule specifying which relations require polite reference has to be
qualified as follows. The reference of respect is not obligatory in the case of
say, mund 'brother-in-law'. Certain mund-s may have acquired a kind of brother
relationship. One knows them well, has a close friendship with them.    Then, a
singular pronoun in addressing or referring to them is acceptable. If one does
use the plural in such instances it is to signal some fear or awe.        Social
distance as a feature of plural address or reference to an individual may be
more appropriate than respect.
     Father- and mother-in-law, however, are invariably addressed and referred
to by plural equivalents of second and third person pronouns. The relationship
to them is characterized as sig qau 'very sacred/taboo'.
     Considering the overwhelming number of unrelated languages that Head quotes
as exhibiting this phenomenon, many more Papuan languages may have to be
included. As Head postulates, the usage of plural for social distance seems to
58                          STRUCTURES AND THEIR FUNCTIONS IN USAN
point out the iconicity of language: a relationship to a group is less intimate
than that to an individual. The use of a plural pronoun and/or plural verb affix
in referring to an indivudual may be seen as a device to 'magnify' the other.","[72, 73, 74, 75, 76]"
"     The whole nominalized clause (ur ... wurugumatarau) functions as the noun
phrase modifying the HN qomon 'custom'. In such contructions it is then very
unlikely that the HN will be further modified by adjectives and quantifiers, or
that the composite HN (=Nominalized clause + HN) will function as a HN of a
replacive relative clause (see 6.2), although, again, this is in principle
possible.
     The formula for NP (1) shows that Usan is not an exceptional SOV language.
It conforms to Greenberg's universal     #20 in that the order of modifiers with
respect to the HN is: N_ + Adjective + Numeral + Demonstrative (1966:69).
Furthermore, Usan is postpositional and has the genetive preceding the noun,
which makes it, together with the general order of the NP, an example of one of
the   more   preferred   language types according to Hawkins' principle of
Cross-category Harmony (1980:224). According to Hawkins' predictions, non-rigid
Verb-final languages would be more harmonic with at least some operators on the
noun following it, whereas rigid V-final languages would be more likely to have
the operators precede the noun.       It will become clear that Usan is rather
rigidly V-final (but cf. 5.1.1 and 6.6 and 6.7 where possible 'leaks' are
discussed).   Since Hawkins' predictions are not meant to be absolute, Usan may
be seen as a rigid Verb-final language with a deviant Genitive-Noun order.
     In 3.5.3 I already discussed the possibility of quantifiers following the
determiner, contrary to what is indicated in (1). If that is the case, as in
(5), the quantifier is no longer part of the NP, but stands in apposition,
leading to a partitive interpretation.      (5) (a)    wonou wau   eng ombur um-umirei
                 his   child the two   die-3p.FP                 'Two of his children have died'This contrasts with a construction with the quantifier included in the NP:
                                               PREDICATION                                                    123
     (5) (b)        wonou wau   ombur eng um-umirei
                    his   child two   the die-3p.FP                    'His two children have died'    When sentences such as              (5)     (a)   and     (b)   are     given   in        isolation,      the
difference     is      best indicated with the English glossess given. There is greater
subtlety involved however. Both these sentences may be used when                               the     possessor
had only two or more than two children. Possible glosses are then:     (5) (a)       Given his children, the two have died            (b)    Given the two children [already mentioned], they have died     In   other        words, the difference between (a) and (b) is more pragmatic than
semantic.     But this pragmatic difference causes                   the    different         scopes    of    the
quantifiers       as     indicated     in    the first glosses to be the more likely semantic
interpretations.
     Establishing the limits of the NP is even more important                            in     the    case    of
stative   clauses,        which      in Usan do not employ copula verbs.                 Thus, we may have
either of the following two constructions as a stative clause:     (6) (a) pnunon âib eng
                  |_man    big the                          'That is the big man'            (b)    munon eng          âib
                   man      the       big                   'That/the man is big'     The (6) (a) example consists of one NP constituent which is a comment on an
extra-linguistic          topic,     which     is   not     itself expressed.       The (6) (b) example
consists of two constituents:                the topical     NP     munon    eng    'the      man'      and   the
adjectival     comment âib 'big'.            This distinction is important, because it allows
for a satisfying interpretation of replacive RCs that occur by themselves,                                    i.e.
not as a term of a superordinate predication (cf. 6.2.4).
124                               STRUCTURES AND THEIR FUNCTIONS IN USAN
4.1.2     The structure of the clause     One of the typological characteristics of Usan is the predominance of verbs
and verb sequences, as mentioned in the introduction (1.1.3). In natural speech
there are very few utterances for which only one verb suffices. Most states of
affairs are expressed by combinations of verbs, many of which are highly
restrictive with regard to their semantic loading.         This makes explicit
reference to semantic functions in most cases redundant. Therefore the present
section as well as the one discussing semantic functions, is not as illustrative
of the typical nature of Usan as for example the chapters on coordination and
subordination.
     Since sentences are mostly formed by the two mechanisms of coordination and
subordination of clauses the linguistic expression of a predication is termed
'clause'. However, I do not mean to imply some significant theoretical
difference between clause and sentence as one finds, for example, in Tagmemic
theory. Corresponding to the language independent schema given in Dik (1978),
we can adopt the schema (7) for Usan.","[140, 141, 142]"
"(Notice also, in this example, that the comitative is included in the plural
first person pronoun in (b); the speaker is the only other person in that
action, yet the subject is in 'we').
84                             STRUCTURES AND THEIR FUNCTIONS IN USAN        The verb 'to say' qâmb has also obvious connective functions.                            Where it   is
used     in   purpose       clauses     it governs indirect quotations which require certain
changes in          personal    reference      compared      with    direct         quotations     (cf. 6.6)*
Compare       the     use   of first person pronoun in the purpose clause in (93) and the
second person pronoun in the direct quotation in (94), both of                             which    refer   to
the same individual.       (93)   wo mi         âib ye-s-eib                  qâmb      qâm-arei

               I     thing big y o u - g i v e - s g . F u t - l s thus say-3s.FP
               'He said:       ""I will give you something b i g "" '     Besides this usage, it also marks noun phrases, particularly when it                                   is
understood that the noun thus marked is only one item out of a greater set.                                 In
this respect it resembles the use of English 'say' when one wants to give                                   an
example, compare (95) and (96).","[101, 102]"

                                                     PREFACE     This description of structures and their functions in Usan has been
submitted as a doctoral thesis to the Faculty of Arts of the university of
Amsterdam.
     Usan is a Papuan language spoken by approximately 1400 people in the
Madang      Province         of     Papua     New Guinea. I would like to express my deepest
appreciation to numerous Usan speakers who taught                            me      their        language   and
their culture, and who extended their friendship to me. My main teacher has
been Piniau Manat, who for years has been                       my        friend     and     colleague.      Any
field-linguist would be fortunate to have a teacher like him.","[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]"
"1.1.3.2.4          Medial verbs     Probably the most characteristic feature of languages belonging to the
Trans New Guinea phylum is the use of special verb forms to signal clausal
conjunction.   Such verb forms are generally known as 'medial verbs'. The term
reflects the fact that they signal that at least one more clause needs to follow
to reach the end of a well-formed sentence. A second function served by medial
verb affixation is to indicate a switch-reference system, i.e. it indicates
whether the subject of the following clause is coreferential (SS for Same
Subject) or not (DS for Different Subject) to the subject of the clause in which
the medial verb functions as predicate.
     There are languages in which the medial verb also indicates some temporal
relationship between two consecutive clauses.       It does not seem possible to
point to common factors in the morphology of medial verbs as they appear in the
TNG phylum languages.
     Among the Highlands languages, the most frequent pattern of the medial verb
structure may be given as:        (8)   verb stem + medial morpheme + anticipatory subjectThe medial morpheme may be 0 if the subjects of the consecutive clauses are
coreferential. In that case, of course, the anticipatory subject is the same as
the subject of the medial verb. In some languages, e.g. Fore (Scott 19 78) of
the East-Central family, and Telefol (Healey 1965) of the Ok family, the medial
morpheme may signal simultaneity or sequence as temporal relationships between
the medial verb and the following clause.
     Haiman (1980:xlviii) presents two other patterns for medial verbs, which
can be combined into :
18                        STRUCTURES AND THEIR FUNCTIONS IN USAN     (9) SS:      verb stem + (in)variable ending
           DS:    verb stem + (more complex) variable ending marking the
                               subject of the medial verbThe languages of the Finisterre-Huon group exhibit             (9)   as    the     more     frequent
pattern.     When the subject of the following clause is going to be different, the
subject of the medial verb          is   identified,   which   accounts     for     the     variable
ending.      In   the   case   of   coreferential      subjects,   the    medial     verb    has an
invariable ending, which is sometimes zero.
     Languages such as Waskia (Ross and Paol 1978) and Siroi (Wells 1978) which
both belong to the Madang-Adelbert sub-phylum may be said to illustrate schema
(9). However, in both these languages, the DS medial verbs are morphologically
indistinguishable from final verbs. This means that DS medial verbs are affixed
for tense and subject person-number as final verbs are.
     Usan also represents schema (9).       It is typologically     similar   to
Finisterre-Huon languages in this respect. The SS medial forms have endings
that vary only according to the verb conjugation. The DS medial forms indicate
person-number of the subject of the medial verb. The medial subject affixes
differ considerably from the affixes on final verbs: second and third person
are neutralized and their forms are totally different (cf. 3.9.1).
     Haiman claims that from a morphological standpoint all medial verbs are
nominalizations (1980:xlviii). His arguments are based upon data showing that
the anticipatory subject affix in (8) is a personal pronoun in East-Central
languages, and, secondly, that medial verbs may co-occur with a number of
suffixes whose distribution is confined to nominal expressions. I am not
convinced by his arguments.
     Firstly, Usan as well as the Finisterre-Huon languages do not indicate the
anticipatory   subject   in   the   morphology   of   medial verbs.    Secondly,
nominalization of verbs requires different affixation (cf. 3.2.1 and 3.9.1).
Thirdly, not only medial verbs but also final verbs used sentence-medially may
co-occur with material that is confined to nominal expressions (cf. chapter 6 ) .
Fourthly, Haiman himself suggests that the medial desinence in Fore and other
East-Central languages is possibly derived from the connector gi   'and', which
also occurs as a phrasal conjunction. I do not see why a construction like 'I
did something and (then) he...' should imply that the predication 'I did
something' must be nominalized.","[35, 36]"
"Other languages, such as Ambulas, a member       of    the   Sepik-Ramu   phylum,   use   a
special dependent verb form:      (23) abuba      jébaa ya-n du     toakwa yaap raké de      yo
           in.garden work     do-   man woman   rest sit     they will           'The people who worked in the garden may rest'The form ya-n is defined by Wilson (1980:75) as 'past tense accessory verb'.
'Accessory verbs' are used in relative clauses (her 'included' clauses), and are
more restricted in their inflection than finite verbs. It would appear that
Gahuku not only has prenomlnal RCs, but also replacive ones, in which case the
head noun is part of the RC:      (24) agmina makisi na         moq-ma-mo         voe-li
          those    greens he.ate Top-Def-sg.subj      what?-it.said           'Those greens that he ate... said:         ""What?"" (Deibler 1976:49)     Deibler analyzed (24) as an instance of postnominal RCs: na 'he ate' as RC,
following the head noun makisi 'greens'. This RC structure, as alternate to the
one in (22), is preferred when no head noun is available (i.e. where English
would have 'the one that...' or 'those who...'), and when the RC exists of more
than one clause. Rather than analyzing (24) as a postnominal RC, I would see it
as a replacive RC: in stead of the equivalent HN within the RC, it is the
antecedent N that is not expressed. In fact, Gahuku allows the fully expressed
NPs to occur simultaneously, if the speaker needs to emphasize the, clearly
topical, head noun (Deibler, pers. comm.):      (25) vegana lamana keza mihuka hora ale vegana nene...
           people good   they garden work do people the           'The good people who worked in the garden...'
                                              SUBORDINATION                                                 219
The Gahuku construction (2 5) is similar to (2 6 ) , which Kuno (1976b) proposed                              as
the underlying structure of the Japanese prenominal RC                            in (27).       (26)    [[""sono hon wa              Hanako ga   yonda           hon
                [ t h e book THEME         H.     SUBJ r e a d         book       (27)      Hanako ga         yonda              hon

utterances, should be marked as a thematic NP, since the head noun of a RC is
ipso facto the topic (my terminology) of the RC. Deibler's characterization of
(25), giving a high degree of prominence to the topic vegana, seems to
correspond to Kuno's hypothesis.
     Like Gahuku and other Papuan Highlands languages, Usan has both prenominal
and replacive RCs.     Siane, related to Hua and Gahuku, has both prenominal and
replacive RCs (Dorothy James, pers. comm.).       The prenominal construction,
however, is the more frequent one.   In Usan we find the opposite: replacive RCs
are far more frequent than prenominal ones. Both variants seem to be related to
a construction in which both antecedent and relative NPs are expressed.
Consider (28), which illustrates a normal order clause relativized.       (28)    [mimon qemi b a u - o r                  eng J                 ye    me   ge-au
               [man     bow     take-3s.FP       RC     the     GoObjTop      I    not   see-NOM                'I did not see             the man who took the bow'
                                         /the bow that the man took'          [<Given that a/the man took a/the bow, I did not see (it/him)]In isolation, (28) can mean either of the two glosses, although the first one is
more    likely.       The     second reading would preferably be expressed as (2 9 ) , where
the determiner which follows qemi should establish the object as topic.                                  Without
the first determiner, the sentence is questionable.       (29)   i [gemi eng munon b a u - o r                   eng I        ye            me    ge-au

220                           STRUCTURES AND THEIR FUNCTIONS IN USAN                  'The bow that the man took I did not see'Another way to make clear which noun is being relativized on, is to                     retain    the
antecedent NP, as in (30) (a) and (b):       (30) (a)               RC               . •   HN
                   munon qemi bau-or             munon eng      ye me ge-au
                   man   bow take-3s.FP          man   the      I not see-NOM                    'I did'nt see the man who took the bow'             (b) munon qemi bau-or             qemi eng ye me    ge-au
                    man      bow   take-3s.FP bow    the I   not see.NOM                    'I didn't see the bow that the man took'     If the antecedent NP is retained, then the identical noun within the RC
should not be marked with the determiner eng. Nor should the object in (30)
(b), qemi 'bow', be fronted.       The reason may be that the prenominal RC is a
descriptive adjunct to the topical antecedent NP. If the relative NP is still
present within the RC, topic marking would be too much.
     It is possible to have the RC in Theme position, i.e. the whole predication
marked by eng and followed by a pause:       (31) munon qemi bau-or             eng,   qemi/munon eng ye me       ge-au
             man       bow    take-3s.FP the     bow/man      the I    not see-NOM             'Given t h a t a man took a bow, the bow/man I d i d n ' t s e e '
The relationships between these constructions suggest that the Usan RC (28)                       has
developed        from a basically paratactic construction, (30) or (31). Evidence for
this development may be found in the following properties of (30): (i) the                       verb
of    the   RC    is   final; but (ii) without final intonation; and (iii) there is no
major pause between the RC and the HN, as is found in (31).","[236, 237, 238]"
"Meimi    may be reduplicated as meimemi in indirect questions, meaning 'whatever',
for example :      (39)   wo unor      meimemi   at    mâni yâb       igo      ende qâmb
             he mother whatever do.SS yam cook.SS be.3s.Pr thus say.SS             g-ib          qâmb   is-ai
             see-sg.Fut.SS say.SS descend-3s.NP             'He went to see whatever his mother did when she cooked yam'        Meimi 'what' is also used for 'which', preceding the noun          that   identifies
the     category    of    objects from which the hearer is expected to choose the right
alternative.       When meimi means 'which', no differentiation is made between human
and non-human features; thus:      (40) (a)     meim   wau    eâb     igo?
                   which child cry.SS be.3s.Pr                   'Which child is crying?'             (b)   meim    nam   sue-i-b-an?

       Manner     is    questioned    with     the     following       compounds    of   mâi:   mâi-gâs
'what-like'       =     'how',   or   again,   mâi-si         'what-do'.     Number is questioned by
reduplicating mâi:          mâi-mâi       'what-what'     =     'how   many'.      Likewise,    time   is
questioned       with    mâi:    qen mâi-t 'time what-at' = 'when'.                Reason or purpose is
questioned with the following phrase:       (41)   meim-et qâmb
              what-for say.SS          'saying for what' = 'why'     The relator -(e)_t expresses a number of semantic functions (see 4.4.1),
among them Beneficiary.      Usan resembles many other Papuan languages in this
expression of 'why' (see further 6.5 and 6.6). The verb 'to say' qâmb is not
obligatory in this question phrase, but usually it is present.
     Universal question words, such as 'whoever' or 'whatever', occur in the
protasis of some conditionals.             They are expressed in Usan by the question words
your     'who'    or    meimi    'what'     followed     by     the    quantifier ger 'one', as (42)
illustrates.       (42)   meimi ger indâr                   qâmb      qomor-un       eng ende

Qualifying adjectives are found immediately following the head noun. Numerators
and quantifiers follow the adjective, if the latter is present.
     The numerators and quantifiers will be discussed first.          Since the
adjectives overlap considerably with the category of adverbs, it seems better to
discuss these two word classes consecutively        in   order   to   show   the
interrelationship.

3.5.1     Numerators        The    original   Usan     counting     system   seems     to    have   been a mixture of a
base-two system and a bodypart-counting system.                  Thus:    (43)       1 = gâri [the little finger of the left hand is bent]
                           The weak form ger meaning 'one, a certain' is used
                           as indefinite article.
               2 = ombur [the ring finger joins the little finger] or,
                           reduplicated: ombur-ombur.
               3 = ombur gâri [the middle finger is also bent]
               4 = ger ombur ger ombur
               5 = uben ig ue [lit. hand side not, i.e. all fingers of
                                the left hand are bent]
               6 = uben ig   ue     ig   gari
                   hand side not    side one (only)
              10 = uben ig   ue     ig   ue
                   hand side not    side not     After that, wrist, elbow, shoulder, etc. were used. Most people now alive
do not know how the system works beyond 10. In fact, the numbers given so far
are the only ones presently used. Numbers higher than 3 are borrowed from Tok
Pisin.   They follow the noun that is to be counted, and are themselves followed
by the form ende (<e 'here/this' + ng 'given' + t at/for/etc.' + e 'this' =
'thus'), as in:    (44)      munon seben ende
              man    seven thus               'seven men'     The smaller numerals, gâri, ombur and ombur gâri behave like the less exact
quantifiers. Presumably based upon some old trading system, 10 Kina (Kina =
currency unit of PNG) is referred to as gotau gâri 'one stick'.","[77, 78, 79]"
"       Although I have benefitted from                   many        publications,         special      mention

book,       his     publications         on    Hua    have     had    a    great      influence         on    my
understanding of Usan and Papuan languages in general.

1 The Usan people and their language
1.0 Introduction     Libraries have been filled with various grammars of the major languages. It
would be presumptuous to think that one could do justice to the richness of a
lesser known language in the course of a few hundred pages or so. This is even
more difficult for someone who is not a native speaker. After all, judgements
regarding acceptability of certain expressions are only valid when they come
from someone who has internalized the language. One does not need to hold to a
strong reading of the Whorfian hypothesis in order to acknowledge that language
and culture are interdependent in complex ways. When I present this description
of Usan, I am very much aware of the many shortcomings and loose ends that will
surface. T hope, however, that at least one thing will become clear: Usan is
spoken by people who have come to terms with their physical and social
environments in a creative way and this is reflected in their language.
     The creative faculty of man implies that the possibilities of human
behavior are open-ended. Since language is one part, probably the most typical
part, of human behavior, we would be dealing in principle with an infinite set
of language expressions. In actual practice, one can get by in any speech
community with a rather restricted vocabulary and (syntactic) combinations
thereof. But native speakers have the capacity to reach into almost forgotten
corners of their memory and their collective heritage to bring forth more
specific idiomatic tools to express what they want to say. It is this capacity,
I believe, that a foreigner never attains, even when he/she reaches a high level
of proficiency.
     A grammar is supposed to provide the rules and principles that account for
the well-formed expressions in a certain language. Given the fact that language
expressions, just as human behavior in general, form an open set, it is
difficult, if not impossible, to formulate a finite set of rules that hold true
for a hundred percent. The danger is great for anthropologists and linguists to
become guilty of hubris: a group of people, the language of a speech community
is reduced to an object or a piece of machinery, whose movements can be
described in a manual of n pages by an omniscient researcher.
     Language is used for communication Cas well as for thought processes, I
think, but this is not the place to enter into a discussion on this topic).
Adequate communication in a speech community is achieved through a relatively
small sub-set of the infinitely possible expressions. Therefore I think it is
2                    STRUCTURES AND THEIR FUNCTIONS IN USANbetter for a non-native speaker to base himself on natural usage (= actual
tokens of language expressions) as much as possible.     The extreme alternative
would be to degrade true native speakers to sentence-producing machines. Yet,
natural tokens of language need to be compared with, checked against, a more
systematized knowledge about well-formedness.        So, elicited material will be
included both as positive and negative evidence for certain rules.
     Ever since my first contact with the Usan, I have wondered what a Dutch
kinship system, or a grammar of Dutch would look like if analyzed and described
by an Usan scholar. We may pride ourselves in the illusion that we use """"etic""
(cf. Pike 1967) categories in a first description of an unknown system before we
arrive at a more """"emic"" description of what is peculiar to a language or a
culture.   Any science that concerns itself with human behavior in its widest
sense must never forget, however, that the researcher is part of the object of
his research.      Even foreign cultures or languages cannot be objectivized as if
the anthropologist/linguist were ""outside the system"".        I have often felt
 ""outside the system"" of the Usan.           But if I studied their language as an
objective system of sentences I would deny their humanity. As an observer I am
not outside the object of study, since I bring with me my internalized grammar
of Dutch, more superficial knowledge of a few other languages, and ideas about
languages which I have accumulated through reading linguistic literature. I do
not consider these ""prejudices"" as etic or objective categories.          With my
personal "" e m i c "" viewpoint I may do great injustice to the """"genius"" of Usan.
This disclaimer is important. It has always been my deepest wish to know the
Usan and their language the way they would like to be known. But I can never be
certain that I have succeeded in doing so.
     The Usan form a relatively small speech community.   Their language has
proven adequate for the communication needs they have felt in their particular
situation.
     In this sketch of the functions and structures of Usan I will try to show
the unique features of the language: how speakers can exploit certain principles
for communicative purposes, how the       language   reflects   their   physical
environment.   Uniqueness, of course, can only be shown in the context of
communality with other languages. In the course of this description we shall
have numerous occasions to observe similarities and differences between Usan and
other languages, those that can be called 'Papuan' in particular.","[11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20]"
"     Concepts such as 'general simultaneity' as in the case of Anggor an-, and
'sequence' for Fore ma, seem to be more specific semantic labels for instances
of pragmatic presupposition.     Any event that is described as preceding or
enveloping the event of the main predication is ipso facto background. That is,
it needs to be taken for granted by the hearer if he wishes to identify the main
predication. Similarly, the concepts of 'contrast' and 'contra-expectation'
involve the presupposition of one event. As I have said earlier, assertion and
presupposition only form extremes on a continuum.      This would explain the
apparent historical shifts resulting in synchronic fuzziness with regard to
certain conjunctions (cf. 6.7 and 6.8).
     Having seen that the forms translated by many researchers in Papuan
languages as 'but' are in fact the demonstratives for topic marking and
relativizing, it is not surprising that the history of English 'but' shows a
development from a preposition to a coordinate      conjunction.    Jespersen
(1917:127ff) shows how Old English be-utan developed from a preposition via a
negative relative pronoun to a   ""natural conjuntion where the notion is
negative"" (p.131), which is frequent in an object clause after a negative
expression, as in:      (97) It_ must not be denied but I_ am a plaine dealing villaine
           (p.130)In the same way, Usan eng (or: ego for some speakers when the sense of
antithesis has to be conveyed) 'this given', Waskia mu 'that' and equivalent
forms in other Papuan languages convey a contrastive conjunction. As such, it
is not infrequently used to introduce new sentences (6.8). I take the embedding
by means of a preposition to be of the same nature as that by means of
demonstrative-like forms.",[266]

(cf.    3.7), is    considered appropriate for discourse deixis.                  So, only the near
deictic is left, and       this    is   mostly      used    with   the   suffix    -ng   indicating
''givenness', as illustrated with munon eng ' that/this/the man' in (9).
       Anaphoric and cataphoric references are accomplished by the near deictic in
the following configurations:       (19) e-ng-t-e               >          ende
            this-given-to/for-this            thus         is used anaphorically;            e-t-e                         >   ete
            this-to/for-this                  thus         is used cataphorically.
216                       STRUCTURES AND THEIR FUNCTIONS IN USANBoth forms are frequently used in connection with quotations, ete preceding                   and

a sentence-initial position, which can be either P 2 in (1), or if this position
is absent, P1 as illustrated by:       (21) (a)   munon eng             , wonou man       soau         is-orei

characteristics of a relative clause (RC). Some general                features     include   the
presence    of a finite verb, or a distinctive non-finite form; the RC often has a
pronoun coreferential with a noun preceding or following the RC; the RC together
with   a nominal forms a NP constituent; the RC begins or ends with a distinctive
marker.
       As a semantic characterization, Downing states that a RC never stands alone
                                       SUBORDINATION                           217
as a complete sentence.        It is always linked, semantically at least, to a NP
which is part of another clause. In other words, a RC functions as (part of) a
term of a predication.
     This characterization is compatible with the semantic definition given by
Keenan and Comrie (1977): "" A n y syntactic object is a RC if it specifies a
larger set, called DOMAIN of relativization and then restricted to some subset
of which the restricting sentence is t r u e "" . Kuno (1976b) states what he calls
the thematic constraint on relative clauses as follows: "" A RC must be a
statement about the relative NP and thus about its antecedent"".
     These characterizations hold for three Usan constructions. The first one
employs a nominalized predication with the verb in the form 'stem + au' (cf.
3.2.2), which precedes the head noun it modifies.          A   second   relative
construction also    precedes the head noun, but in this case the RC contains a
finite (i.e. final) verb. The third   relative construction contains the nominal
constituent about which it makes a statement. In this RC too, the predicate is
in the form of a final verb, which is normally followed by the determiner eng.
In other words, the whole predication takes the place of a nominal with eng as
operator. It is this third construction that is structurally identical to
subordinate clauses that function as a conditional protasis, a temporal
adverbial, or a reason adverbial. I will first discuss the form of the RC, in
comparison with some other Papuan langauges. An account of the (pragmatic)
function of the RC will provide a natural bridge to the discussion of the
structurally similar subordinate clauses.","[233, 234, 235]"
"      It     is    not   difficult       to   identify    at least some free pronouns in the FP
suffixes.         I have no explanation for the divergent forms for 2               and      3   singular
for classes 4c, 6 and 7.            The fact that first person forms in all tenses display
-m is also unaccounted for, except for the possibility that this may be                            related
to   some    old      basic    verb form which is now first person singular.                 Reasons for
this conjecture are 1) occasionally               this    form   surfaces     as    SS   medial        form,
sometimes with the cessative suffix and 2) the -m form is found in all plural FP
suffixes.         Be that as it may, the plural forms            show   rather     clearly       the    free
pronouns      in     'we'     and   an   'you,pi'   and    the   plural     morpheme -ri, albeit in
metathesis.

3.9.1.2.4       Future        We turn now to the two future tenses.          The basic verb root for     the    future
tense     has     been   discussed for the future medial form.       In case of the straight
future tense, the only requirement is. to suffix the Pr tense suffix set                 to   it,
with the provision that the first person suffix vowel is /â/              for all conjugation
classes and that the backvowel is elided.             This yields the following set:     (118)      Future tense suffixes                1s:    -ib-am                  e.g. is-ib-âm   'I will go down.'
                2s:    -ib-ân
                3s:    -ib-â                          etc.                lp:    -ub-oun
                2p :   -ub-oumon
                3p:    -ub-our     Following from what I said in 3.9.1.1.1 this means, of course, that class
4c yields yemb-âm etc. for singular subjects and yomb-oun for plural subjects.
     Soae verbs display irregularity. The class of causative verbs, which have
their SS medial end with -si (not siâb), have future forms like conjugation 4a,
i.e. -si-erib — s i - o r u b . So does the process class of verbs, formed with some
nouns and adjectives with -t(er), e.g. qoyam 'knowledge' >          qoyamet 'become
knowledgeable' , which yields qoyamterib and qoyamtorub as future stems. The
verb diâb 'come up', even though behaving like other verbs of class 4d,
nevertheless follows the 4a class in the future tense: di-erib.","[115, 116]"
"     (NOTE: The near and far past tenses are normally suffixed with           -ei,   which
occurs also on negative future, expressing inability or involition.           This suffix
does not appear in RCs, possibly because of morpho-phonological reasons in            that
RCs are followed by eng.      At the same time, normal sentence-final past tenses or
RCs without eng occur without -ei, especially in fast speech.        I have    not    been
able to identify any meaning of this morpheme.)     (33) Hua:    [fu do-e        fu         0      do-ma'     fu

adjectives, but then asserts that there is evidence that they are deverbal nouns
occurring as qualifiers (p.263).     His latter assertion seems to me more
plausible.   Hua, together with other Eastern Highlands languages such as Siane,
Gahuku and Fore, has at least some qualifying adjectives following the head
noun. In Usan all adjectives follow the noun (3.5), but modifying nouns precede
the HN:     (34) (a) munon âib eng
              man   big the              'The big man'          (b) munai ginam eng
              house place the            'The house place = village'
222                      STRUCTURES AND THEIR FUNCTIONS IN USANPrenominal RCs operate in the same way as prenominal nouns: iyau goter 'he bit
the dog' in (32) and munai 'house' in (34) occupy the same slot in the NP. This
suggests that a prenominal RC is in fact a nominalized clause. However, in (32)
the verb does not show the nominalization morpheme -au (3.2.2).
     The prenominal RCs seem to be closely related to the more frequently used
replacive RCs, which take the place of noun phrases.   If there is a functional
difference between nominalized clauses as noun modifiers and prenominal RCs, it
is very subtle. I have not been able to detect it. Compare the two modifying
clauses in (35), which have the same gloss.      (35) (a)   sarau ba-tar        igo      yâmângâr ger
                 work hold-pl.Ben.SS be.3s.Pr woman    one           (b)   sarau ba-tar-au                 yâmângâr ger
                 work   hold-pl.Ben.NOM          woman    one                 'A woman who works for others = a servant'     It is with this habitual aspect that prenominal RCs are likely to occur. A
nominalized clause as in (35) (b) MUST be habitual or generic, as seems to be
the case for processes of noun-incorporation in         other   languages   (cf.
Mardirussian 1975). But the prenominal RC, although it is most frequently used
with habitual or generic events, may also refer to specific events in which the
referent of the HN is engaged.        Thus, (36) (a) is not acceptable with the
indicated gloss, whereas (36) (b) is:      (36) (a) *mani u-t-au         wau eng...
                 yam    3s-give-N0M boy the                 'The boy to whom they give yam...'      (36) (b)   mâni u-t-emir     wau eng
                 yam 3s-give-3p.FP boy the                 'The boy to whom they gave yam...'","[239, 240]"
"     Examples which come closest to being equivalent to the logical operator AND
involve symmetrical and reversible (cf. R. Lakoff 1971) conjuncts, as in:     (5) (a)   John and Peter
                                  are two of my uncles
         (b)   Peter and John     Haiman (1980:249 and 431ff) has given examples of symmetrical conjunctions
in Hua of both nominal constituents and clauses. Symmetrical conjuction of
predicates is in Hua used especially for reciprocal constructions. Usan, with a
lexicalized reciprocal construction (cf. 3.9.1.3.1), does not need such a
construction for this purpose, even though a comparable construction does exist
(see 5.2). The decisive criterion for symmetrical conjunction (which is a
sub-type of what I consider to be coordination) seems to be that reversing the
order of the conjuncts has "" n o narrative significance"" (see for this claim:
Haiman 1980:432).
     Asymmetrical coordination, then, does not allow reversal of conjuncts
without   a different interpretation of the described data or a certain
awkwardness. Asymmetrical coordination seems the more general case, especially
with regard to predicates or fully expressed predications. But even in the case
of coordinated nominal expressions one could raise the question whether
narrative insignificance for alternate order of the conjuncts is really as
widespread as the term symmetrical conjunction would suggest. It may not be
accidental for example that symmetrical conjunctions are often illustrated by
proper nouns as in (5), or other elements that are as neutral as possible with
respect to functional relationships that may exist between the conjuncts. When
one finds, however, that pairs such as nuam-net 'mother-father' in Waskia (Ross
and Paol 1978) or ur-unor 'father-mother' in Usan are nearly lexicalized
compounds, the arbritrariness of the order of coordinated conjuncts becomes
questionable.
     A further factor that weakens the strength of the reversibility of
symmetrically coordinated elements is the almost universal      pragmatically
motivated order of elements according to the principle ""first things first.""
176                              STRUCTURES AND THEIR FUNCTIONS IN USAN
As for the coordination of predications, Kempson (1975:198ff) suggests that the
maxim 'be orderly', with the interpretation 'unless you explicitly mark the time
relation, make your narration of events reflect their sequence' holds equally
well for AND as for 0 linkage, as in:      (7) (a)         Rob Roy rode away and jumped on his horse               (b)    Rob Roy rode away. He jumped on his horse     It seems to me that (7) (b) lacks the obvious awkwardness of (7) (a) in
that the second clause of (7) (b) may be interpreted as a specification of the
first one. The conjunction with explicit and in (7) (a) makes this series of
clauses much more of a temporal sequence, resulting in an awkward sentence.
     Reversibility then will not be a factor that we could fruitfully consider
in the discussion of coordination in Usan. Coordination represents the most
neutral semantic relation between two (or more) elements. Grimes (1975) uses the
term 'collection' to refer to this relationship. One could say that a speaker
does nothing more than indicate that the conjuncts of a coordinate construction
belong together in that they have the same function in relation to the (simple
or complex) predication that S. expresses. As Grimes (1975:221) has pointed out
regarding his concept of 'collection': ""when applied to events it takes on a
different form ... When the events take place at different times, the effect is
one of temporal sequence."" This explains why symmetrical conjunctions are
easier identified in the case of nominal expressions than with clauses.","[193, 194]"
"3.3    Pronouns     Usan has a system of six personal pronouns.    The singular forms reflect
rather clearly the proto-forms of Set III, which Wurm (1975) has posited for
certain areas covered by the Trans New Guinea phylum, including the Madang
province (cf. 1.1.3.2.1): 1s da~ta~ya; 2s _na_; and either nu of Set III or wa of
Set II. The free pronouns are given in (22). They are used rather frequently
although each verb clearly identifies the person-number of the subject and, in
the case of animates, of the object. The free pronouns are recognizable in the
possessive forms as well as in the object prefixes that are required by certain
action verbs. These derived forms suggest that the present free pronoun forms
for first and second person plural are abbreviated forms.

     Even within a series of same referent medial verbs, a free pronoun may
appear in order to focus on the referent of the subject-topic, as in:
    (23) ..qâm-ar.           Ende qâmb     wogub    ne wo Agqaur ginam igo...

"        (92)        Ag   >    Go   >   Rec        >    Ben    >     Ins     >       Loc   >    Temp
160                  STRUCTURES AND THEIR FUNCTIONS IN USAN     In Dik (1980) we find three arguments for the necessity of the Object
function: (i) if a language allows both Go and Rec to occupy the Object
function; (ii) if a language has a 'Raising'-rule by which the Ag of a
subordinate clause is marked as Obj of the superordinate predicate; and (iii) if
a language allows a causative opposition between schema's such as x made y V z
and x made z to be V-ed by y. Usan has none of these possibilities.
     This means that Dik's Functional Grammar would consider the syntactic
functions Subject and Object irrelevant for Usan. In spite of my affinity to
Dik's model, I have nevertheless appealed to these functions in order to account
for cross-reference of some semantic functions on the verb. Not only Ag is
cross-referenced for person-number on the verb. The functions Positioner,
Processed and Force (and Item, which is needed for State predicates formed by a
Position-taking verb + continuative igo 'be, stay') are cross-referenced by the
same verbal suffix. In the case of inanimate semantic functions (Proc, Fo, It)
number is not signalled as plural; inanimate entities are cross-referenced by a
third person singular subject affix (cf. Classical Greek, where neuter plural
subjects trigger only singular verb "" a g r e e m e n t "" ) .
     Rather than having to specify that the verb agrees with a number of
semantic functions, I would suggest that it is the syntactic function Subject
that triggers verb agreement.     This allows us to formulate rules that pertain
equally to all semantic functions that are cross-referenced by the verbal
suffix. For example, the rules of switch-reference, as they will be given in
5.3, refer to the syntactic function Subject, albeit that factors of topichood
may override their application.
     Within the framework of Dik's Functional Grammar, De Groot (1981) has
suggested to use the concept of          ""First Argument"" for the set of semantic
functions that are cross-referenced like the Agent (for a similar solution cf.
Okombo 1983 for Dholuo). Given the definition of Subject as entertained by Dik
C.S., namely "" t h e point of view from which a state of affairs is described"", I
see no problem with a stipulation that in Usan the subject function is
invariably assigned to the semantic function Agent (at least in transitive
constructions).","[177, 178]"

Apparently, Kewa can use either SS or DS as long as the person category         remains
the   same and only the number changes.      Usan obligatorily has SS in these cases.
Conversely, Usan may choose when the number and person categories        both   change,
in which cases Kewa has obligatory DS.
In both languages then the person category is more important than the number
category.
     When the shift in number goes the other way, i.e. from singular to plural,
again with the singular participant being part of the plural set, as in (64),
Kewa and Usan agree in marking the change of person as DS:      (64)                                               Usan     Kewa             3 sg shot a pig and 3 p1 carried it home    BOTH     BOTH

             2 sg                 1 p1                   DS       DS
             1 sg                 1 p1                   SS       BOTHThese shifts are by nature from 3 to 2 to 1 person, i.e. from a low               high
position on the topicality hierarchy (cf. kuno and Kaburaki 1977):      (65) Speaker   >   Hearer   >   Third person     With the person category remaining the same, again Usan obligatorily marks
SS and Kewa may choose, except that Usan may choose also with the person lowest
on the hierarchy. Apparently, there are cases where it is at the discretion of
the speaker, within the general rules of the language whether he/she marks a
certain partitioning as SS or DS. The decisive factor for the choice seems to
be pragmatic : does the speaker consider the shift in participants important
enough to warrant a DS marking? In other words, if, for example, a Kewa speaker
has been thinking about a group of which he was a part and then shifts the
attention completely to himself as an individual, he would mark 1 p 1 → 1 sg as
DS. If he as speaker was the center of attention to begin with, he may choose
the SS marking when going from singular to plural.      With the person category
remaining the same, Usan can only choose when going from 3 sg → 3 p1.

5.3.3     Temporal clauses     A third exception to the rule of same/different subject marking mentioned
by Longacre concerned temporal clauses.       This exception can be extended to
include clauses that describe meteorological conditions and other clauses that
give some setting or background information. In a sentence such as (66) Usan
may choose whether to mark the clause preceding the temporal one as SS or DS:        (66) ye bur wâb     ba   ir-âb                  1 worom is-a          ne
             I pig shoot.SS take ascend-SS                 sun  descend-3s.DS and                                        ir-ine
                                       ascend-ls.DS            ginam weib       di-amei

            I arrived in the village'The temporal clause itself, worom is-a 'the sun set', has to be marked as DS.
A similar situation is found with experiential verbs (cf. 4.2.8).       In many
Papuan languages, concepts such as 'hunger', thirst', 'sickness', 'pain', etc.
are expressed by rather special constructions: the Experiencer is given as
Topic, and this is cross-referenced on the verb by an Object prefix, while the
subject person-number affix on the verb agrees with the afflicting item. Again,
the clause preceding the experiential clause may be marked as SS or DS, provided
the subject (i.e. Agent, Positioner, etc) of the first clause in constructions
such as (67) is coreferential with the experiencer as well as with the subject
of the third clause.        (67) munon isig eng sarau âib        ab-a           migeri

             'The old man will work hard and become exhausted
             and he will stop'      The choice between SS and DS marking preceding the experiential                            clause     is
apparently        determined        by     discourse       considerations.        When      presented     with
sentences such as (67)             in    isolation,       Usan   speakers       will   assign    the     first
predicate     a    DS   marking.         In natural texts, however, when the topic is clearly
established before the clause with the experiential verb, and when that topic is
coreferential       with     the        experiencer,      one    finds   only SS marking on the first
clause.     This 'false'       SS marking is also attested               with     clauses     that     contain
other than experiential verbs.
     In an oral history account of heavy fall-out from a vulcanic eruption (see
Appendix), many precautions are mentioned that people would take in case of a
re-occurrence.   These actions are summarized with the formula given in 5.2:
'thus doing':      (68) ende at    ne tat dar-a            mor igo    minemb
           thus do.SS and sky come.down-3s.DS home be.SS hungry.SS             ig-orun       qâmb...
             be-lp.UF say.SS             'They did thus and lest they would be hungry, staying
             home (when) the sky would come down they ...'","[219, 220, 221, 222]"
"       Either        the     rising         or   the falling intonation contour may be employed for
content questions.
       Leading questions are characterized by a slight adaptation                       of    the      rising
pitch     intonation             of    (34).     The high pitch in the case of these questions (as
well as in their use as rhetorical questions)                      is   normally    restricted      to    the
question particle qi:        (35)    in mágin     nam su-5

sentence medial rising pitch which co-occurs in particular with presuppositional
nominais (cf. chapter 6 ) , but it may also fall on                     medial    verbs.     It   is     more
pronounced       on    medial          verbs     which are followed by the periphrastic verb wogub
'cease.SS' with or without the connector ne 'and'.                        If me 'and' does occur,          it
will    be     stressed and pronounced with a high pitch.                  The number of rising pitch
contours per sentence is indeterminable.                      Such a medial high     pitch    creates      an
optimal       environment             for    a   pause.   Thus, it signals something like: "" I ' m not
finished yet. Keep the floor open for m e . ""

     Consider (36) for an impression of how a   sentence   may   be   realized   with
stress, pitch and pauses:

3     Morphology3.0     Introduction     In this chapter I will discuss the various categories that seem necessary
for a grammar of Usan. I will briefly illustrate and discuss the criteria for
the various word classes by referring to their semantic and           syntactic
peculiarities, with excursions into pragmatic exploitations that are allowed in
some cases. Following this I will discuss the various forms of affixation,
which is mainly restricted to verbs. The few non-verbal instances of affixation
are discussed in 3.9.2. Reduplication (3.9.3) affects all major categories,
such as noun, verb, adjective, and adverb.","[59, 60, 61]"
"1.1.3.3.2     Presuppositional nominal      Fully     explicit       NPs    that refer to something that the speaker considers as
given information have a deictic or a form derived from a deictic                     as     operator.
This same form may be used as operator on predications that are considered to be
given information.           Such constructions function as           relative   clauses     supplying
specific      information about one of their terms.                Such replacive relative clauses
(the term is from Downing 1978) may be the only possible means of relativization
as    in   certain        languages of the Madang-Adelbert sub-phylum, e.g.            Siroi.      They
may be the preferred, i.e. most frequent, alternative                    to   pre-nominal     relative
clause formation, as in Usan.               Or they are a less frequent alternative, with the
prenominal relative clause as the more frequent construction.                     This seems to      be
the   case     in    Highlands       languages,    e.g     Hua (Haiman 1976) or Siane (D. James
p.c.).
      In very many         languages    of     these     groups,   structures    identical    to    the
replacive      RC   may be used as the protasis of conditional sentences, as temporal
satellites or as reason-clauses.              With NPs marked       as   given   information,      such
clauses      have    in    common    that     the speaker offers them as containing pragmatic
presuppositions for the assertion that he/she wishes to make.                    Most of      chapters
6 and 7 is used to discuss these facts in greater detail.
20                             STRUCTURES AND THEIR FUNCTIONS IN USAN
1.1.3.3.3     Medial verbs      The     syntactic        significance       of medial verbs is, in my opinion, that these
verb forms indicate coordination of predications.                        The   order    of      clauses     with
medial      verbs is tense-iconic, i.e. the chronological order of states of affairs
is reflected in the syntactic order.                    Since   medial     verbs      themselves      are    not
affixed      for   tense (and often also not for aspect and mode), they are dependent
for these categories on the following final verb.
      In a number of languages medial verbs may be affixed, or followed                               by     free
forms,      with   material          that    normally     co-occurs with nominal expressions. Hua,
Siane, Fore, Chuave of the Highlands languages use                        affixation      and     Usan      as    a
representative       of        the   Madang area uses a free form. In this case, it would be
more appropriate          to     see     such   medial     forms   as     standing      in   a    subordinate
relationship to the next clause.
      The     switch-reference              system of the medial verbs does not just monitor the
absolute coreferentiality of consecutive subjects                        but   this     is   true     for        all
Papuan      languages      that        employ    switch-reference.         The factors which determine
whether subjects of consecutive clauses can be considered to refer                               to   same        or
different entities are discussed in detail in chapter 5.","[37, 38]"
"1.1.3.3     Syntactic characteristics1.1.3.3.1    Word order     It can be safely said that most Papuan languages of the TNG phylum have the

verb in the sentence final position.        The order of the terms, i.e. nuclear
arguments and peripheral satellites as they are known in Functional Grammar (Dik
1978, 1980, etc.), is relatively free. Nevertheless, it seems that the Subject
(which covers the various semantic functions such as Agent, Positioner, etc.)
normally precedes the Object (Goal, Recipient) in most neutral orders in the
clause, so that we may speak of a basic SOV order in these languages (see
further chapter 4, where the order possibilities are discussed in more detail).
     The majority of these languages have the adjective following the noun in
the NP. This is a fair generalization of the languages of the Madang-Adelbert
sub-phylum and the Finisterre-Huon group. A number of the Highlands languages
have some adjectives preceding the noun, others following it.
     The Genitive preceding the Head Noun is a more general pattern.     This is
also   true    for    the    order  Adverb-Verb. Most of these languages are
postpositional: 'axe-with'. The postposition may be either a free adposition or
a clitic that is attached to the last word of the NP.
     The    following     preferred orders are also widespread: condition-main
predication; cause-effect; intention-main predication. For the latter semantic
relationship, the use of the verb 'to say' is a typical feature of TNG phylum
languages, somewhat in the form of: 'the woman 'getting yam' saying, to the
garden went' for ""The woman went to the garden in order to get some y a m "" . The
specifics of these constructions are discussed in chapter 6, where many
comparative notes are made which relate Usan to other Papuan languages.","[36, 37]"
"     As a conclusion to this section, I would suggest that coordination of Terms
can be handled according to schema (17), which achieves coordination through
expansion.   But it seems better to analyze 'gapping - like' constructions in
Usan as instances of non-realization of terms and/or predicates of a shadow
predication. The expression of predication takes places in time, i.e. linearly.
When two instances of a state of affairs are contrasted in terms              of
participating roles or props, the second predicate and/or identical roles do not
need to be expressed.
      This situation is closely related to other instances of a 'truncated'
sentence, where again. for reasons of highlighting, already known predicates,
sometimes with accompanying arguments, may be left unrealized, as in (34) and
(35).

5.2   Coordination of predicatesIn 3.9.1.1 I have given the morphological features of medial verbs and indicated
their syntactic function as that of coordinate conjunction of predicates (or
predications).   As such, medial verbs are linked to a final verb which
determines the tense-aspect-mood categories of the compound predication to which
the medial verb clauses belong. Medial verbs may be directly coordinated to
each other or to a final verb. Both conjunctions may also be marked by the
coordinator ne 'and'. The difference between a naked coordination and one with
ne can only be defined in subtle pragmatic terms, which will be further
discussed in 5.2.1. The following example, involving gab 'see' and qamb 'say',
may illustrate that medial verb-medial verb, medial verb-final verb and the same
sequences   with the additional insertion of ne       'and' are all basically
coordinating conjunctions:      (36) wo namanimun gumat    big-a     gab   qamar-ari

"3.6     Adverbs3.6.1    Temporal adverbs        A small set of adverbials express the            time    reference    of     a    predication.
These     are     not   fixed   to   a   certain     position    in   the clause.        However, time
references are often topical in the sense that they provide a frame of reference
(cf.      Chafe 1976) for the predication and as such they are found in the initial
position.        Such is the case for time         expressions    such   as   qoan       [lit.   'old',
presumably the head noun 'time' has been dropped] 'before', qoan ir 'long                         ago',
qen ger-t [lit. time one-at] 'later', se 'now' etc., for example:       (67)     qoan   in tain-eb ne wurinou ur     qoan eng ete

Barim is used for both 'day-before' and 'day-after', differentiated by the tense
of the verb.         Urigom 'skipping one' may be added to express 'day after tomorrow'
or 'day before yesterday'.
       Both    se and barim not only indicate absolute time, i.e. in relation to the
time of utterance, but also relative time, i.e. in relation to the time that the
predication          refers to. se_ is for that reason differentiated by the addition of
the deictic e:          see 'now, today', and the clitic           -t.   'at':   set    'at   the   time
that'.       Some of these factors are illustrated by the following two examples:      (68)    wo barim           dier-i-b                qâmb     ende misir     ig-a

and   thus     stand     in     a coordinate relationship to the main predication, e.g. ai
gâb-gâb 'earth see.SS-REDUP' means 'in the afternoon':      (70)      ai     gâb-gâb           umo     is-u-b-oun

these,     there are the words pi 'near', pa 'far', mug(en) 'middle distance', etc.
which can be used both as adverbs and as adjectives.                            Other     place    adverbs      are
qataben        'on     the   way', qon-ut 'at the side', etc. One of the reasons why it is
difficult to ascertain what the correct position of locational adverbs is in the
clause     is        that    one     hardly        ever     expresses     more than two terms in each Usan
predication (cf. 4.1.2).
        In the case of pa, _pi, and such distance-specifying words, here                                again   (as
is   the case with the temporal qoan 'old, before') the best analysis seems to be
that they are original adjectives with the head noun deleted.                                  Compare:     (71) (a)          qumo-t                igo      qitebig           dier-inen        eng

                      we near not go-Nom very far go-lp.FP                       'We didn't go nearby, we went very far away'        According to the proposed analysis then, _pi and pa in                           (71)     (b)   would    be
understood           to be modifiers of head nouns such as ai 'ground' and ginam 'place'.
Just as qen in (67) is no longer necessary, so these head nouns can be dispensed
with, and the result is that the adjectives seem to function as adverbials.
        This    analysis does not apply to an adverbial such as qataben 'on the way'.
This is a genuine locative adverb                         which,   when    it   occurs    with     other    terms,
normally precedes the object or instrument, as in:

and     which      are    highly restricted in their collocational possibilities.                      Manner
adverbs, which could be termed 'pre-verbs', form almost a unit                          with     the   verb,
because       no    terms may intervene between them and the verb.                  An example is urim,
which together with baub 'take' means 'steal1.                       Some   instances    of     this    class
seem     to     have     originated     as    nouns,   such     as    mungam    'sleep'.       Consider the
expressions in which this item appears:       (73)     mungam yener-a

verb for 'to lie down' is inâb.                This verb may be used to mean 'to               sleep',    but
when it is not clear from the context, the verb inâb is modified by mungam:       (74)   mungam inâb         igo-ai
                sleep     lie.SS be-3s.FP              'He was asleep'The same effect is achieved by the adverb naat:       (75)   naat        in-ai

Or in combination with mungam:    (76)   mungam naat in-ai           'He is asleep'
           [lit. 'sleep asleep he has lain down']     As the examples for urim, mungam and naat suggest, these adverbials are
highly restricted in their use. There are others, with unclear origin, that may
only be used with specific verbs. An example is qinat 'for no reason', which
can only be used with eâb 'cry':    (77)   wau     qinat           eâb      igo
            child for .no.reason cry.SS be.3s.Pr            'The child is crying for no reason'     Finally, there are a good number of verbs that are almost exclusively used
in their medial SS forms followed by another verb. The medial verbs express the
manner or circumstance that defines the state of affairs expressed by the main
verb. I do not see any need to differentiate these verbs into various
sub-classes, but some can be used with a number of verbs (78) (a), while some
can be used as main verbs and these are only used adverbially when they are
reduplicated (78) (b). Others appear to be highly restricted and may just as
well have been nouns, except that certain forms (i.e. those ending in -i_ or -t)
are likely to be original verbs (7 8) (c). Of these, some have only been observed
with the existential verb igo 'to be' (78) (d), others with certain motion verbs
(78) (e), or with the more generic verb ebet 'to do' (78) (f). Examples are:    (78) (a)     wo sorasi   imat-erei / napi-arei

serialization.   As is the case with serial verbs, which I will discuss in more
detail in 4.3, these verbs may be interrupted by modal particles, such as _bo
'again' and me 'not'. Moreover, as with serial verbs, these adverbs may also
precede the adverbial verb with no resultant change in meaning.   Thus, we may
get (79) (a) and (b) as denial of (78) (a):                                 NEG ADVERB VERB
     (79) (a)   wo morogan       me     sorasi im-au

differently from the adverbs described thus far. They cannot possibly be traced
back to adjectives, nouns, or verbs. These particles express a certain mode
which operates on the predication as a whole. Most of these modal particles
behave rather freely throughout the clause without the different positions
having any clear affect upon its meaning. Examples are: bo 'again', 'in turn',
gor 'also', mom 'enough', 'completely', qând 'quickly', qas 'only'.
     In particular bo may appear more than once in a sentence, in various
places, with no difference in meaning as a result.           Compare its various
positions in (80). Each of the occurrences of bo would have been sufficient by
itself, but the repetition does not strike any hearer as unacceptable, except
that four times in such a short stretch seems a little overdone.     (80)   munon eng bo              igo-i          wogub        qen ger-t      bo      misien

are given in 3.3.           For convenience they are repeated here:        1s = yV-                   lp = _in  ini
        2s = nV-                   2p = an   ani
        3s = _-                    3p = wuri   wuru    (w)oro     The referenced object may be present as a nominal constituent in the same
clause or sentence or in a preceding one.          As far as its affix status is
concerned, I may mention that it is as loose as the reciprocal prefix. That is,
the object pronoun may be detached from the verb, in which case it is
insensitive to the processes of vowel assimilation (2.1.8.3). Also, with verbs
like ab 'call' the pronoun functions as the purpose, affixed with the
postposition -t.
     In 3.1 I have given three verbs which have the object pronoun (actually, it
might be better to speak of 'goal pronoun', but cf. 4.4.1; 4.4.2) incorporated
in the verb stem. That is to say, wâb 'to shoot', wârâmb 'to hit', and utâb 'to
give' change their stems considerably according to the person-number of their
goals. Other action verbs will have zero object prefix for third person
singular.   Since inanimate plural subjects are cross-referenced on the verb as
                                             MORPHOLOGY                                      109
singular (cf. 4.4.2), it is indeterminable whether the object prefix can
cross-reference only animate objects. Given the way plural inanimate objects
are conceived of as singular, the third person plural object prefix could never
refer to inanimate objects, and the third person singular does not have an
explicit object prefix.
      The singular object prefixes assimilate their vowel to the vowel of the
verb stem in most cases. The process of vowel assimilation is rather weak in
Usan.    For example, duet 'to desire someone to stay' changes the object prefix
vowel of ye 'I' to a high back variant /u/ (and the alveolar stop is weakened to
a flap): yu-ruét. But suâb leaves the prefix unchanged: ye-suab 'cutting me'.
Some verbs drop the initial glottal: qoat 'wait' yields noat 'wait for you';
others leave at least a trace: na-qaiget 'carry you on the shoulder'.
      Plural object prefixes also change their vowel features in the following
way: in 'lp' and an ' 2p ' are followed by an epenthetic vowel (or is it the high
front vowel /-i/ as is found in possessive pronouns?) preceding a verb stem with
initial consonant. This vowel harmonizes with the stem vowel. The vowels of in
and an. themselves are immune. This is not the case with wuri ' 3p ' . Preceding
stems with /a/, /a/, or /o/, the prefix becomes woro or oro. Preceding stems of
which the first vowel is /u/, only the prefix final vowel has to be assimilated:
wuru-bumani 'embrace them'.      When consonant-initial verb stems have a front
vowel (/i/ or /e/) as first vowel wuri remains unchanged:           wuri-qenungar
'like/love them'.
     Verbs of the conjugation classes 1, 2, 3, 4a, and 4b have the SS medial
suffixes -et, -at, -ot, -âb replaced with -ar when their object prefix refers to
a plural object.     As an exception to this rule, it should be mentioned that
class 3, i.e. those ending on -ot, retain the back vowel /o/.   Thus we get:   (144)     irubét          'wait impatiently' : an-irubar 'to wait
                                                         impatiently for you.pl'
             gumát           'spear' :               wuru-gumár 'to spear them'
             mirimot         'lie, deceive' :        wuri-mirimo-ár 'to deceive them'     The verb gab 'to see' distinguishes itself from all others by the fact that
metathesis     is     required for plural objects:         i-bag 'see them'.    When the object
refers to first        and     second    plural,   the   stem-initial    /b/   is   prenasalized:

"      ( 13 )   John Ag gave a_ book Go to Peter Rec
      (14)     The climate Fo gave John Rec new strength Go      But this implies that different verbs give have to be listed in the
lexicon, with different arguments. This solution does not seem superior to the
verb classification in case grammars, where each verb is given with its basic
case frame.     But if each verb is listed as such, it may no longer be so
revealing to classify them along the two coordinates of control and dynamism,
unless it is to define the total set of semantic functions a certain language
differentiates. In other words, Dik's classification necessitates two semantic
functions that have control over the state of affairs: Agent for Action verbs,
Positioner for Position verbs. Dik's classification is attractive, in that it
recognizes the presumably universal importance of volition that is involved in
controllable states of affairs. The dimension of dynamism I find a little more
difficult to handle. Just as with the concept of transitivity, one can ask what
it is that is being dynamic in some states of affairs describing psychological
states such as hate, love, believe, etc. If one wants to formulate some general
syntactic rules for various classes in Usan, a classification according to the
two parameters in Functional Grammar is insufficient.
     It is true that Dik's Functional Grammar allows for a subdivision of the
four classes according to the nuclear arguments of the predicates. But such a
categorization would still not allow for optimal generalizations of syntactic
rules in Usan. The classification which I consider necessary for Usan predicates
is basically a semantic one, supported with various syntactic-morphological
rules. On the basis of various rule possibilities one can distinguish eleven
classes, which I will rank according to controllability and transitivity.",[146]
"     The normal expression of reason-result relationships is iconic in Usan.
Chronologically, causes and reasons preceed effects and results. The Theme in
(44) concerns a result ad the predication is going to give the reason. Although
it is possible to express two states of affairs in the order result-reason (cf.
6.5), it would be highly marked. In (44) then, the result is first stated as
Theme, then it is repeated verbatim as a consequence of the state of affairs
that provides the reason.     In 3.8.2 I mentioned that periphrastic wogub
'cease.SS' tends to carry a causal meaning. I believe that (44), as well as its
use in (43), certainly strengthens this hypothesis.        (45) qenen      munon eng ende at      qib-ei    seret       wogub
             always man       the thus do.SS go-Cess despair.SS cease.SS             ig-urei
             be-3p.FP             'Always the man was doing thus until they despaired and (so) they
             stayed'        Again, (45) shows a shift in number, 3sg             3pl, marked      as   Same       Subject
following.        The    final verb igurei 'they stayed' follows the periphrastic wogub
with causal overtone and communicates that their staying is                effected      by    their
despair of ever finding the culprit, and          hence     their   staying     contrasts       with
doing something: they stayed doing nothing.             The transition from (45) to (46) is
made without a Tail-Head linkage.           Instead, the next sentence        starts    with      the
coordinator       ne    'and'. And a new time frame is indicated with qen ger-t 'at one
time' (= later).        These data suggest a major break in the narrative,              i.e.      one
could     interpret this as a paragraph break.          I say this in rather cautious terms
because I do not want to give the impression that a              paragraph    is   as     clear    a
formal     unit    as   a   sentence.   Groups   of sentences exhibit various degrees of
332                     STRUCTURES AND THEIR FUNCTIONS IN USAN
homogeneity. Whereas a sentence in Usan may be unequivocally defined as a
structure ending with a final verb and final intonation (with granted exceptions
in cases where medial verbs with final intonation end an utterance-sentence), I
do not think it is possible to posit such clear criteria for the boundaries of
larger stretches of text.    Paragraphing, then, makes use of a number of
criteria, of which absence of Tail-Head linkage in narrative material is a major
one, albeit not a sufficient condition, as is illustrated by the absence of
Tail-Head between (46) and (47).      (4 6) ne qen ger-t munon eng bo     itum der    is

not as major as it is between (45) and (46), since no other features strengthen
the break.
                         THE ORGANIZATION OF INFORMATION                     333
     In (47) we have a further specification of the state of affairs nd nub
wogub isa 'he ate something and went down' which was only mentioned in passing
in (46). This specification highlights the topical participant by the NP +
pronoun reference: mani eng wo 'the snake he'.
The """"stripped-down"" verb (= verb root) i_s_ 'descend' suggests a close
relationship with the next medial verb ibiat 'defecate'. In contrast with the
 ""stripped-down"" verbs, for example in (46): der is gar eng 'given that he got
up, went down and saw', here in (47) the morphologically minimal verb is
separated by a lot of verbal material from the event 'defecate' with which it is
so closely linked. The intermediate material sets a time frame: nam irib qâmb
'as he was about to go up the tree' and the Goal and Locative receive rather
heavy identification as well. The Goal term is expressed as a presuppositional
nominal, functioning here as a relative clause: mogobi qâmb nuor eng 'the taro,
say, that he had eaten'. This plurality is also responsible            for   the
reduplication of the adposition ten 'together with all these other things'. The
Locative in (47) consists of a Head and an apposition, both marked with the
postpositional clitic -t (cf. 3.6.2).     (48) igâm-a   munon eng is       ibi       eng g-âb     toat

          followed, looked up and saw the snake lying curled up above'     Strictly speaking, (47) does not provide a "" T a i l "" to which the """"Head""
igâma of (48) can be connected. The existential verb refers to a state of
affairs that is understood as a consequence of the snake's going up. As
described in 4.2.6, the normal way to express a state of affairs as object of a
perception verb is by means of a medial verb construction. This explains why
âsi 'look' is marked for SS. Another way of looking at it is to say that mani
... bugâb igama 'the snake was lying curled up above' is a backgrounded clause
of the type discussed in 5.3.3.3. In that case, one would have to say that the
Goal object of the final verb garei 'he saw' is unrealized since it has been
explicitly mentioned only in the preceding clause.          This might    be  an
interpretation   which does justice to the """"genius"" of Usan and which
334                        STRUCTURES AND THEIR FUNCTIONS IN USAN
 ""explains"" the normal way in which a predication is expressed as the object of
a perception verb.
     This sentence is followed by another parenthetical comment by the narrator:      (49) mani     eng gag              yâ-gâi-âr            qâmb       ibiat

          would see him and went on top and stayed (there)'Here, the existential verb igoai 'he was' does not indicate continuous aspect.
It is a full verb coordinated with the previous medial verb-complex ibiat
'defecate' wogub 'cease' and the ""stripped-down"" verb ir 'ascend'.
After the explicit reference to the various participants in the preceding
sentences, no such reference is needed in the following sentence which is loaded
with action:      (50) igâm-a       gâb      wârâmb           wogub         nami

           in order to take yam up and cook it with the snake'
                              THE ORGANIZATION OF INFORMATION                                     335
     Since the verb nami refers to an action normally done by more than one
person, i.e. two men carrying a tree on their shoulder (nam = tree), I take it
that here the other man (perhaps the women as well) enters the scene, so that we
have another instance of 3sg → 3pl marked as SS, which accounts for the SS
medial verbs preceding the plural DS verb wâgari 'they left him'. In this
sentence, the narrator seems to get ahead of himself: 'they went to the garden'
uses a medial verb, which is then followed by a purpose construction which ends
the   sentence.    To   have   a purpose construction as Afterthought, i.e.
sentence-final is not unusual (cf. 6.6), but normally this would be the case
following a final verb.      The narrator has to add some information about the
situation prior to their going to the garden and checks himself by simply adding
the purpose construction following the medial verb iua 'go' and a pause.
     This construction and the beginning of the next sentence illustrate how an
Usan speaker can deviate from the iconic principle that ""first things are to be
mentioned first"".        (51) man      is-ub                     qâmb     ne   wau      foa    eng

occur     sentence-initially:        mi     e   bigoun      eng    'this thing that we've put here'

336                           STRUCTURES AND THEIR FUNCTIONS IN USANclause on the Goal term that occurs within the embedded predication. This is
necessary in order to place the free pronoun an      'you.pl' in the initial
position, since this topic is to be contrasted with the other participants: in
'we'. The two free pronouns clearly constitute a case of contrastive focus.
This sentence, then, illustrates how a medial verb may have the illocutionary
force of a command: The first conjuct an    ... igâmari has a second person
subject, and it resorts under the same tense category as the second cunjuct in
... yomboun 'we will cook'        With the removal of one topic, the other two groups of participants are                     in

              after a while it became light and they went down'In     (71)   the    verb    igo     'be'   is   marked    for DS preceding the temporal clause
urigeramorei, Whereas in (72) igo is marked for SS.                   The    clear     difference    is
that     in   (61)     'it   became    light'      is a final verb, whereas in (72) it is in a
medial form.        This means that in (71) urigeramorei is seen as a significant                   new
event    in a series, and hence the verb preceding it signals a topic-shift by its
DS form.      In (72) urigerma represents the middle              clause    of   the    schema   (70),
establishing a reasonable condition for the Topic to continue its actions.
     In summary, we can formulate the following principles for the operation of
the switch-reference mechanism in Usan (and, as I argued in Reesink 1983a, in
other Papuan languages):1. It monitors the coreferentiality of subjects in consecutive clauses within a
sentence.   The shifts in number as discussed in 5.3.2 provide some specific
interpretation of the degree of coreferentiality.
2. It does not do this indiscriminately: if the subject of the first clause is a
strong    candidate      for topichood (human, definite), and it is continued as topic
in a third clause, the less topical subject of the intermediate                      clause   MAY   be
disregarded     by     the S/R mechanism, which results in a 'false' SS marking on the
verb of the first clause.
6     Subordination16.0     Introduction     In this chapter I will discuss some structural and functional properties of
subordination as it applies to clauses and sentences. Subordination is the
mechanism by which one communicative unit (= predication, as discussed in
chapter 4) is used as a term in another unit. Subordination contrasts then with
coordination which simply adds one communicative unit to another.            The
difference between these two mechanisms may be schematically represented as:      (1)   (a) Coordination:    P1   S O V   +     P   1   S O V            (b) Subordination:   P 2 , P1 S   0   V , P3                                      P1 S 0 V     When a predication is embedded as a nominal constituent in any of the
constituent positions in (1) (b), it contains in most cases a pragmatic
presupposition, whereas a coordinated predication as in (1) (a) expresses in
general a second assertion (cf. 4.4.3). The schemas in (1) give the impression
of a clear dichotomy between these two syntactic mechanisms. It will become
clear in the course of this chapter and the following one that it is more a
matter of gradation between two extremes.
The subordinate clause seems to be a natural domain for the expression of a
state of affairs that the speaker wants to take for granted. It is the
'background' for the 'picture' of the main clause (Talmy 19 78).          Such a
metaphorical characterization of a subordinate clause is similar to Chafe's
definition of a Topic:   "" A spatial, temporal, or individual framework within
which the main predication h o l d s "" (1976:50). We shall see that the structure
of Usan, and other Papuan languages, underscores the linguistic validity of
1 The basic contents of sections 6.1 Topic and 6.2 Relative clause have been
published separately in Reesink 1983b. The conclusion of that paper 'Subordinate
clauses as RCs in Theme or Topic positions', is worked out in more detail in
sections 6.3, 6.4, and 6.5.
208                        STRUCTURES AND THEIR FUNCTIONS IN USANthese metaphors.
     Central to the discussion of subordination in Usan is the function of the
determiner eng, which makes up about 9 percent of all word tokens in texts with
a total of 37500 words.       In 3.7 I showed that eng is made up of the near
deictic e 'here, this' and the suffix -ng (phonetically [ng]) which indicate
'givenness'. The determiner eng not only functions in 'Given NPs', which are
potential topics, but also with       nominalized predications. A nominalized
predication may function as a replacive relative clause, a conditional protasis,
or as a temporal adverbial clause. When the nominalized predication with eng as
its determiner is cliticized with the postpositional clitic -t, it expresses
cause or reason.   The nominalized predication, if followed by eng, is a
presuppositional nominal in all these cases.
     In order to show the structural and functional relations, I will first
discuss in some more detail the pragmatic functions of Topic and Theme.       In
section 2 the relative clause will be discussed, followed by a discussion of
conditionals in 6.3, temporals in 6.4, and cause and reason in 6.5. The notion
of reason is semantically related to that of purpose. Purpose and related
relations make use of the periphrastic verb qamb 'to say' in Usan and other
Papuan languages.    This is a different form of subordination, which will be
discussed in 6.6.
Finally in this chapter I will compare some of these subordinate constructions
with coordinate relations (6.7) and illustrate how the morphological markers eng
'the, this, that' and ne 'and' may also be employed to conjoin sentences into
natural sequences.","[223, 224, 225, 226]"

                    wash-CM-3s.Pa                     'She washed the eye which the mud had injured'     Both these languages resemble Usan, although they belong to different
families, in that the verb of the RC is final, with full inflection.       It would
seem that some Highlands languages, such as Hua (Haiman 1980) and Fore (Scott
1978), differentiate the functions of Usan eng over two (perhaps more, as is the
case in Siane, D. James, pers. comm.) morphemes. Hua ma, which replaces the
indicative mode affix -e in RC verbs, is identified as a near deictic (Haiman
1980:258).   According to Haiman (1976) the connective           particle   mo   is
historically related to ma, and this marks potential topics.
     Fore ma is called a delineator in a NP by Scott (1978:100). Its origin
might be the same as Hua ma. (In fact, morphemes equivalent to ma occur in most
Highlands languages.      In various languages some meaning of 'givenness' or
'specificity' seems appropriate, cf. Korafe amo in 6.3 (71)).
     Fore does not seem to use ma for RCs, but besides the above-mentioned use
on NPs, it is also used with medial verbs. In the latter case, the clause with
ma seems to adopt some presuppositional status, cf. Reesink 1983a.
     The Fore RC makes use of a final verb, i.e. with full inflection for tense,
and a special set of subject person-number suffixes, called Emphatic subject
morphemes. Fore ma, marking potential agent or actor, and a sequential
relationship between medial verb clauses, may well be related to some deictic.
Scott (1978:82) list m á : ' as the near deictic 'this', 'here', and compounds with
ma for various far decitics. My point here is that it is basically a deictic
form whose usage is extended to mark states of affairs the speaker takes for
granted.","[251, 252]"

              yâ-nâm-onei         'you hit me.FP'3.1.1    Derived verbs     Many verbs of conjugation 6 seem to be derived from nouns or adjectives
according to the formula noun/adj + i (+m) , with the final -m elided in the SS
form and its derived forms. Examples are:        (2)   nam-i        'carry on shoulder [with more than one carrier, i.e.
                             as one carries a nam 'tree']
              tumun-i      'bury'             tumun   'hole in the ground'
              sau-i        'litter'           sau     'woodchip'
              goan-i       'skin'             goan    'skin'
              nanau-i      'be shortwinded'         nanau    'hot'     Verbs such as yari 'be afraid', âsi 'look for', qiumuni 'gather' are not as
easily analyzed.
     A few verbs of this type seem to form transitive counterparts to                   verbs   of
conjugation 7, as in the following pairs:        (3) (i)       ner-er-mâ     'it comes loose by itself' (<ner = ?)
                      ner-i-mâ      'he takes it out, lifts up'              (ii)    wab-er-m       'to hide oneself'
                      wab-i-m        'to hide something'              (iii) âpâm-âr-m       'to become open [e.g. of roof leaves
                                         rotting away]'
                      (b-)âpâm-i-m     'demolish [a roof or a house]'
46                         STRUCTURES AND THEIR FUNCTIONS IN USAN
     Pairs of intransitive-transitive verbs as in (3) are not numerous.
However, it seems safe to say in general that verbs with a stem ending -r, which
needs the morpheme -m in many forms, indicate a process or an action without a
Goal (cf. 4.2), whereas verbs ending -i, also needing -m in the appropriate
forms, predominantly indicate actions with Goal.       Although one can still
identify certain nouns or adjectives in the verb stem of conjugation 6 (i.e.
those ending on - i ) , this does not appear to be a productive process of
verbalization anymore.      This is different with the suffix si, which can be
described as a causative morpheme. Most likely _si is in fact a rather generic
verb for 'to do' or 'to cause'. It can also be used by itself, meaning 'to do
something to someone', either in a positive or negative sense. The verb si can
be suffixed to virtually all adjectives and many nouns, even nominalized verbs.
In most cases it makes a transitive verb [= action plus goal] out of the
non-verbal item. For example:     (4) über            'good'              +-si = 'cause good to someone'
             boru        'bad'               +si = 'cause bad to someone/thing' =
                                                       'ruin'
             yonou       'my'                +si = 'appropriate as mine'
             mumu(n)     'corpse'            +si = 'kill off'
             ibiau       'seedling'          +si = 'make something like a seedling'Some -si verbs do not indicate actions, but precesses (cf. 4.2):     (5)     duun        'cough' (as in duun yâ-nâm-â 'the cough hits me')
                                    + si = ' to cough'             yar         'cliff'       + si = 'to fall [only of humans]'Position-taking       verbs     may     be    causativized by suffixing si to the stem of the
nominalized form:     (6)     bugâb     'sit' , bugam-au        'sitting'    bugâm-si       'to erect';
             nâget     'stand', nag-au         'standing'   nâg(â)-si 'to erect';
             inâb 'lie down', in-au            'lying down' in(e)-si 'to lay down'     Less productive is          the    process    by   which    certain    adjectives   or   other
non-verbal    items     can     be    made     into processes.   This is effected by suffixing
these items with the form -t:
                                             MORPHOLOGY                                        47
     (7)     uber     'good'       uber-t     'become good'
            bi        'soft'       bi-(e)t    'become soft = decay = rot'
            iyo       'yes'        iyo-t      'assent, come to understand'     The verb forms derived from these process verbs show that the extended stem
does not end on -t, but on -ter. In fact, the vowel of this form is epenthetic,
to preserve the preferred syllable structure.   The epenthetic vowel is very
weak, and thus harmonized with the vowels of the verbal suffixes, or weakened to
schwa. This can be illustrated with the following forms of iet 'be bored,
dislike';     (8) iet-o-r-oum                    'I dislike.Pr'
         iet-e-r                        'dislike.sg.Imp'
         iet-â-r-âr                     'dislike.pl.Imp'
         iet-u-r-umei                   'I disliked.NP'
         iet-e-r-ân                     'you dislike.Pr'     It is not possible to give a rule as to which adjectives may be made into
process verbs with -t. Those that may not, use the verb burâb 'become', as:     (9)    boru      'bad'            boru burâb         'become bad'
            mein      'gentle, weak' mein burâb           'become gentle'Other adjectives may be turned into process verbs in either way:
    (10)    gagam 'strong'             gagam-t             'become strong'
                                       gagam burâb         'become strong'
            uber      'good'           uber-t              'become good (glad)'
                                       uber burâb          'become good'     As may     have     become    clear,    certain   verbalization      processes   result   in
consonant     clusters.        Since homorganic nasal voiced stops are analyzed as single
segments, these will not be discussed.            But sequences such as -rm- in        verbs   of
conjugation     7,     and    C-t, t-C and C-s often require an adaptation to conform to
the preferred CVCV syllable structure.            The sequence    rm     is   not   unacceptable,
especially in fast speech, but often a schwa is inserted, as in waber-e-m-oum 'I
hide myself'.        In some verbs, as ârir 'throw', the m may be deleted, so that two
48                        STRUCTURES AND THEIR FUNCTIONS IN USAN
alternate forms are acceptable: ârir-e-m-om 'throw, sg.Imp' and arir-om. This
is exceptional.
     When a process verb is formed out of a noun stem with a different final
consonant (i.e. not a / r / ) , the epenthetic vowel takes on the front or back
feature of the preceding stem vowel: itum 'night, darkness' itum-o-r-(â)-m-â
'it gets dark'.     The second epenthetic vowel harmonizes with the vowel of the
suffix only in very slow speech.
     When a word is affixed with the causative si to make it into an action
verb, epenthetic /e/ is needed only in a few cases. It is not really possible to
state a rule for its presence. For example, the one-syllable stem mein 'calm,
gentle' , when affixed with si has mein-e-si only in slow speech, whereas in
(stem of inâb 'lie down') has in-e-si always. A stem with final stop like song
'idle' has song-e-si 'to confuse, scramble', but âib 'big' does not allow a
transition vowel before the suffix: aib-si 'to make big'.
     In any case, fast speech in most cases does not seem to have problems with
the cluster Cs_, so that the rule of epenthetic vowel insertion may be on its way
out.
     One final morphological rule for the suffixation of -si is that stem-final
/n/ in unstressed syllables is elided, compare:múmun         'corpse'      múmu-si      'kill off' and
woyán         '?'           woyán-si     'to mediate, appease'3.2   Nouns     Nouns in Usan are those words that function as heads of term expressions.
Usan does not allow a definition in morphological terms,    since there is no
inflection of nouns.     The definition as given would also admit adjectives and
question words to the class of nouns.   But, when the latter two categories
appear   as the head of NPs , it is recoverable from the linguistic or
extra-linguistic context which nouns they qualify.
     Given the established CV patterns (2.2) we can deduce that wherever a
(hetero-organic) consonant cluster occurs in a noun, the word consists of two
morphemes, even where the original parts are no longer identifiable as
autonomous items, as in qâb-turin 'Pinon imperial pigeon'. In contrast to the
other word classes (verbs, adjectives, adverbs, deictics), nouns are hardly ever
reduplicated (see further 3.9.3).      Some nouns are inherently reduplicated,
especially some yam species and bird names:        dórundoru        'kind of yam'
        qumb-qumb        'a kind of sorumbi [a tuber]'
        qin-qin          'a cockatoo'.

A noun may be modified by a following adjective, or by a preceding noun, e.g.    (11) ginam         'place'        ginam âib        'a big place'
                            munai ginam   'house place = village'

"     Theme as a function indicates a constituent which precedes the main
predication, which is comparable to Y-movement or contrastive topicalization in
Givón (1981). Theme does not belong to the predication proper, but it can be
said that the predication has to have a high degree of relevance to the Theme
constituent. In Dik's words: ""Theme represents the domain or universe of
discourse within which it is relevant to express the predication"" (1978). In
(93) the Theme yaur 'brook' is carried over from a preceding sentence; it is
stated at the beginning of the sentence which has yagwai' fish' as Topic. The
suffix -u is typical for noun phrases, used in an absolute sense, e.g.       for
vocatives and Themes.

             up and up and up until they arrived at the well of the brook'     When Topic is defined as ""that which the predication is a b o u t "" , or, in my
own words:    ""that which a speaker wants to talk a b o u t "" , formal differences
between Theme and Topic may not be very great at times. A rather persistent
difference, in that it seems to hold for most languages, is that there is a
considerable pause (called """"comma-intonation"" or """"functional pause"") between
Theme and the following predication, which is lacking between Topic and the rest
of the predication.
     In a language such as Usan, the comma-intonation may be the only clue that
we are dealing with a Theme rather than with a Topic. The reason is that some
pronominal reference to the Theme may be present in the predication. The same
reference would be needed for a similar predication with only a Topic. Consider
the following two sentences:      (94)   munon eng                 wonou bur um-orei
             'man      the THEME his           pig die-3s.FP             'That man, his pig died'      (95)   munon eng wonou bur                   um-orei
             man       the his      pig Topic die-3s.FP
                                     PREDICATION                                      163             'That man's pig died'
     In (94) the Theme constituent has a pronominal reference in the form of the
possessive   pronoun   wonou 'his' within the main predication. The nominal of the
Theme may be part of a possessive NP which forms the Topic of         the   predication,
as in (95). In the latter case, there is no comma-intonation.         Clearly, (95) may
have developed from (94) through a process of grammaticalization.
     Tail stands for the right-dislocated constituent following the main
predication, which modifies or clarifies (some constituent of) the predication.
Givón (1976) uses the term 'afterthought topic shift' for this device.
Afterthoughts or Tails are certainly not 'less important' in the total
communicative unit, contrary to what a term like 'afterthought' might imply to
some people. Usan is a strictly V-final language: constructions in which a Tail
contains only a NP are very strained. In typologically similar languages nominal
Tails are more frequent (L. Jarvinen for Mauwake; T. Phinnemore for Ono; both
personal communication). The Tail positon is nevertheless needed for certain
subordinate clauses. Together with Theme and Topic, Tail will be further
discussed in chapter 6.","[179, 180, 181]"
"6.6    Purpose     Purpose is a subcategory of the psychological concept 'reason'. The reason
for doing an action X is often that some other state of affairs will eventuate
or be prevented.     Purpose clauses make explicit what speakers interpret the
intention of certain action to be. In particular actions that are ascribed to
agents can easily be, and often are, conceived of as being done with some
intention (Searle 1980).
     I indicated earlier that various features of topics and subordinate clauses
could be 'explained' by reference to the metaphor DISCOURSE is SPACE. A
corollary of this metaphor is the conduit metaphor, which treats concepts as
containers, messages as going through channels (Reddy 1980). The notion of
intention may also be understood in terms of spatial or possessive relations.
We shall see in this section that purpose clauses in many Papuan languages are
different from the subordinate clauses discussed so far.   But before I present
various Usan constructions, it may be fruitful to point out some striking
similarities in some languages between purpose constructions and locative or
benefactive constituents. In 6.5 I showed how reason can be identified by means
of some locative element or the adpositions that are being            used   for
beneficiaries. The question 'Why did you do that?' may be answered be referring
to some preceding event (cause or reason) or to some following event (purpose).
This following event is the 'goal' of the main predication. Notice, as Searle
has made clear, that the intention as a mental event MUST precede the action, if
the action is to be called intentional. In other words, the mental event is the
reason or cause of the action.
     When one gives something to someone, the recipient is the goal of that
action.   This presumably accounts for the fact that the semantic function
Recipient in many languages can easily be realized as syntactic Object. When I
do something for someone's benefit, again, this is the goal of my action. When
one goes to some place, one's destination is the goal of one's action.
Conceptually, all of these goals are rather similar.          This similarity is
reflected in the morphology and syntax of many languages, even though different
languages may divide the basic concept of 'goal' up into different components.
Consider the following English sentences:      (113) (a) I gave this book to John
            (b) The woman went to the store
            (c) What I wanted to say...
            (d) She watered the plants to let them grow better
                                     SUBORDINATION                            255
     Purpose in English makes use of the same preposition as Goal.    Maybe not
many English speakers would recognize _to in (113) as the same word in all
instances. I would suggest that this failure is due to the same reason why dead
metaphors are no longer recognized as metaphors. Diachronic processes may not
reflect psychological reality, yet they do help to explain constructions that
are found in a synchronic description of a language. In Reesink (1982) I noted
as a significant fact that rather diverse languages use locative markers on
verbs with a purposive, or infinitive, character. Compare the English examples
of (113) with the Siroi locative -am in (114) and the infinitive marker -am in
the purpose clause in (115) (Wells 1978:8 and 86):     (114) turnail-am
           face-Loc              'in front of'     (115) kite   ye pastor tuku fonde kus-am         k-at
           today I      pastor for   fence tie-Intent go-1s.Im.Pa           'Today I went to fix the pastor's fence'When such diverse languages agree in marking purposives and loatives in the same
way, this may indicate some universal tendency to employ the metaphor    DISCOURSE
is SPACE: an intended event is like a spatial goal or reference point.","[272, 273]"

semantic function that requires the oblique object marker -t (in (45) (b) -t
combines with eng to yield end). The Ins of the RC is the Processed-Subject of
the main clause.      It is therefore the topic of the sentence. As such it may
occupy the sentence-initial position, but then it is stripped of its grammatical
relator -t Alternatively, the Ins may retain its unmarked position, as in (45)
(b) . It keeps the relator -t. If the item is not repeated as was the case with
the object NP in (30) (b), the resulting construction is acceptable, but it is
not frequently used. The RC construction of (45) (b) is only possible if the
Ins is marked as 'given' (topical) with eng. If the relator -t were simply
affixed to the noun, as bei-t 'with an axe', one could not relativize on the
Instrument.","[243, 244]"

2.2.1     Some problems2.2.1.1     Consonant clusters        Juxtaposition     of   morphemes       within    a   word    gives      rise to clustering of
consonants,     which     is   not   present      in    mono-morphemic         words.   With    certain
consonants,     clustering is tolerated; with other consonants epenthesis of vowels
is applied to preserve the canonical structure of                   (2 3 ) .    Consonants     that   may
occur     in clusters across morpheme boundaries are restricted, i.e.                    plosives and
nasals may be immediately followed by the only fricative /s/. Thus, we get;

               bu.gám     'sit'   + si →      bugâmsi     'to erect'       The only other consonant cluster that is             allowed    involves   the     voiceless
alveolar       plosive.    The phoneme /t/ immediately following a stem-final consonant
occurs when a noun or adjective is made into a Process verb in a coumpound                       form
with    -tVr- 'become', or when a noun is suffixed with the relator -t 'with, for,
in, etc.'.       In both cases an epenthetic vowel is normally inserted                between    the
stem-final       consonant    and      /t/, but, especially in fast speech, -Ct is possible
(but see 3.9.2 for inconclusive evidence with respect to the relator                     -t) .   So,
for example:       (26)    qoyám        'knowledge'    qoyâmtarei   'he became knowledgeable'
               quguráu      'heavy'        qugurâgtarei 'he experienced problems'

epenthetic vowels. In this way the canonical word structure as represented in
(23) Is preserved. Epenthetic vowels are always unstressed. Since unstressed
syllables have reduced vowels, approaching schwa, it is not always easy to
determine which vowel has been inserted. In the case of the relator -t, the
high back vowel /u/ appears to be the most frequent, e.g. nam-ut 'in a tree,
with a piece of wood' (with namt as an alternative realization).
     In other instances, the epenthetic vowel receives the coloring from the
vowel in the adjacent stressed syllable. This can be noted, in particular, in
verbalization processes, e.g.     (27)     itúm     'dark' is made into a Process verb by means of two
              verbalizing morphemes -r and -m, whose origin is unclear
              (cf. conjugations 6 and 7 in 3.1.):

[itúmerem-â].
     The same process can be observed in all verbs whose stem ends with -r
which, therefore, needs the second verbalizing morpheme-m :      (28)   ârir       'throw'            ârir-im-oum      'I throw.Pr'

so that the cluster -rm- emerges.","[55, 56, 57]"
"3.8.3    Postpositions     Two connectives are used for comitative relations: nob (which is used in
the colour adjectives) and ten, both meaning 'with' = 'accompanied with/by'.
Nob can be used both with human, animate and inanimate objects; ten is only used
with inanimate items, and it means something like 'with all that' or 'together
with'. As is the case in many other Papuan languages (also in West-African
languages, cf. Lord 1973; and e.g. in Russian, see Nichols et al. 1980), the
comitative may be considered as part of the subject for the purpose of marking

Voorhoeve 1975) the feature that sentence-medial verbs are morphologically
distinct from sentence-final verbs, in that the latter normally are inflected in
more detail for subject person-number and tense/aspect/mood, and the former
carry a switch-reference mechanism (cf. chapter 5) with or without signals for
various temporal relationships, such as simultaneity, successivity, etc.
     The nomenclature of medial and final verbs is slightly misleading despite
its generally accepted usage (see many items in the bibliography on Papuan
                                                   MORPHOLOGY                                              87languages).   Medial verbs may occur in utterance-final position. But when they
do, it is usually clear that such an utterance is not a grammatically complete
sentence.   That is to say, the participants in the discourse event are aware
that something is understood to follow. But here, as in so many instances, one
should be careful with dogmatic statements using 'always' and 'never', as if we
were dealing with all-or-nothing situations. For example, utterance (102) uses
a medial verb.   (102)        wâg-a

                be-1p.FP     The differences between the alternative expressions in (75) are subtle. In
general, a pronoun copy of a nominal constituent within the same sentence gives
emphasis to this participant. Such extra focus is given then to Ben in (75) (b)
and (75) (d). The explicit Beneficiary seems to be restricted to Action verbs [ +
Go], i.e. some verbs with the feature [ + Control]. The incorporated Beneficiary
does not necessarily imply that this participant benefits from the action. It
may in fact be adversely affected (recall example (44) in 4.2.9, which
illustrates this with a process verb).
     The incorporation of Ben in the verb conveys a greater degree of
affectedness of the Beneficiary, as is the case in (75) (c) and (d). The latter
fact is borne out by the restriction on the co-occurrence of Ben with process
verbs and the verb igo. An explicit term Ben is not allowed with these verbs.
The following example is unacceptable:     (76)   *narau    irou ye-t   igo
             betelnut many me-for be.3s.Pr     But a Beneficiary verb stem is possible, as indicated in 4.2.11:     (77)   narau       irou igo-s-â
            betelnut many be-for.me-3s.Pr            'There are many betelnuts for me'     Beneficiary verb stems based upon process verbs and igo are not    used   very
frequently.
156                        STRUCTURES AND THEIR FUNCTIONS IN USAN4.4.1.9      Instrument     Instrument (Ins) is inherently inanimate. This function occurs with action
verbs [+ Go], speech verbs, motion and perception verbs. With the latter three
classes the semantic restrictions are of course heavy, and only very few items
can be used as Ins: 'eyes' with 'to see', 'ears' with 'to hear', etc.
     However, the semantic richness of many action verbs results in equally
strong selection restrictions. For example, gumat 'stab' is almost exclusively
done with an qauri ""spear'. Frequently, because of the restriction on the number
of terms per predicate, Ins is expressed as Go of a preceding predication and
understood in the predication that follows, as in :      (79)    wo     bei    ba   nam   su-erei     [= sorei]
              he     axe Go take tree cut-3s.FP              'He took an axe and cut the tree'     When an Ins is expressed in the same clause as the Ag and Go, it is done so
mainly to contrast it with possible other Instruments. Alternatively, Go may be
expressed in a preceding clause and Ins in the following one. In this case Ins
has to be marked with the postposition -t:      (80)   wagar    iring ba   rmut-et             iset     wogub    ne ...

"     In a more recent publication, Olson (1978) shows with examples from Barai
that a reference to subject is insufficient to account for the S/R phenomenon.
He shows that the S/R mechanism is controlled by a number of factors, including
""role prominence, animacy conditions, deliberateness of the Actor, the basic
orientation of the verb, and in some instances the referential status of the
role prominent participant"".
     In this section I will formulate a theory that attempts to explain the
three exceptions noted by Longacre, as they appear in Usan. Although according
to Dik's Functional Grammar the syntactic function of subject is not strictly
necessary for Usan (cf.5.5.2) I will use subject (identical here to 'first
argument', as for example in De Groot 1981) as the pivot for the S/R mechanism
(cf. also Dixon 1979:121).",[218]
"     Usan     can    express        inception of action by this construction, and resembles
the Finisterre-Huon languages (cf. McElhanon 1973) in this respect.

           'I was about to go down, but when it rained I stayed'      Pretense is another semantic category that may be expressed              this   way,   in
which case the verb in the subordinate clause is in the present tense:      (127) Uram ye wagar mungureri eng baub               wor-oum      qâmb

            [lit.: 'Uram took my arrow and saying 'I shoot' he aimed
            purposelessly']     If the event of the subordinate clause is undesirable, and the main action
is meant to prevent it, qâmb is used to mean 'lest', while the subordinate verb
carries the Uncertain Future tense:      (128) yâmângâr ag            is-ari             gitâb       mâni me

                 planting the yam.    Lest the yam wither'It should be evident from this example that the meaning 'lest' is not captured
by the form qâmb. A culturally desirable state of affairs in the subordinate
clause would require the meaning 'in order that'.
     As was the case with conditionals, temporals, and reason sentences,
likewise with purpose sentences one may subordinate medial clauses by adding
the demonstrative, in which case the purpose clause functions as the protasis of
a conditional:        (129)     is i s - i b          qâmb   eng song i s

                  ' I f you want to go down, j u s t go'
     Other languages may operate in the same way. They would embed a medial
verb clause, which has a special intentional or desiderative medial verb form,
by means of a demonstrative, as Siroi (130) illustrates (from Wells 1978:129):        (130) tango wande kanger-am        ndeta-nu kile wande po-ng-a

of    Papuan     languages    are marked in the same way as topics or themes.              They use
the demonstrative that is used for anaphoric reference and              they   are         found    in
sentence-initial position, with or without comma-intonation.              The only exception
are purpose clauses which are embedded as object complements              of     the   verb        'to
say'.
      The       functional explanation I have given referred to the pragmatic function
of presupposition that subordinate clauses share with topics.              What        a     speaker
262                            STRUCTURES AND THEIR FUNCTIONS IN USAN
wants to talk about very often parallels that which he takes for granted as
shared knowledge between himself and the addressee.   The predication that he
makes about the topic then, is the comment; this is what is being asserted.","[277, 278, 279, 280]"
"        Simultaneity        of     two     events   where            the first one has an earlier starting
point and forms a necessary condition for                            the   second     one     is   the     case      with
sensory       verbs    in    particular.          As Kirsner and Thompson (1976) have pointed out
for English, when perception verbs take a predication as complement,                                       as     in     'I
smelled him spraying the room', one cannot analyze the subject of the complement
as the direct object of the                main     verb.            The   whole    event      expressed        in      the
complement         functions       as      object    of        the     perception     verb.        Usan     expresses
perceptions as a sequence of medial verbs (of course, the                                   sensory      verb     itself
may be a final verb if it ends a sentence), as is illustrated for igub 'hear' in
(108) and for _gâb 'see' in (110).      (110)    wuri mi           ni-ari       gâb         ne    wo mu              mendir

               'He saw them eating (this) thing and he was vomiting'     If medial verbs exemplify the iconicity of language by following the
chronological sequence of events, additional coordination devices, as given in
3.8, strengthen the iconic relationship. Insertion of the connective me 'and'
suggests a greater distance between the states of affairs expressed in the
consecutive clauses. The periphrastic verb wogub 'cease' is not just used for a
temporal sequence but expresses some kind of reason relation, even between two
temporally simultaneous events, as discussed in 3.8.2.
     Given all these facts, one may wonder whether it is possible in Usan to
express       something     like     'before   X,   Y'.   The answer is positive.          It is done
according to the schema 'not x be.3s.PS, Y', as in:     (111)    ne me yar-au     igâm-a   wuri isub       munai

              house (there)'       The use of the medial form of the existential verb               'to    be,   stay,     exist'
igo,    following final verbs (yar-au in (111) is an instance of a final verb, cf.
3.9.1.2.6, being the negative past tense for all person-number categories)                        will
also be discussed In 5.3.3.            Here it suffices to state that the existential verb
seems to have the total preceding event as its argument, much as                     sensory      verbs
have    the    event      that     is expressed by the medial verb as their complement.             In
other words, ne        'you' in (111) is NOT the subject of igâma.            If   that    were     the
case, (112) would be grammatical for a first person, but it is not:                       igimine has
to be igâma:     (112)    *ye _me yar-au  igim-ine wuri ... mindat-emirei

other morphological change.            Both SS and DS     forms   may   be    suffixed     with    the

morpheme   -i.  This morpheme is best characterized by the meaning 'cessative'.
It signals that the event of the verb it is attached to occupies a considerable
time span UNTIL the event of the following verb materializes. In principle the
cessative morpheme may be suffixed to any verb. In actual usage the verbs isub
'go down' and igo 'be, stay' are the most frequently modified with this suffix.
In the case of isub it is the verb root _is that receives the cessative, although
isub occasionally is also suffixed with it. As an alternative form -ei occurs
with no clear semantic or morphological motivation.      I will first give an
example with some other verb:   (113)   wuri qorau                eng nob     big      bââb       igâm-ari

verb   with     connective     properties       meaning     'until'.       As    such it may occur in
combination with the SS medial form of 'to come' yârâb:   (114)      ...in taut         isub           ig-unei.      is-i                yârâb

on DS forms than on SS forms.
       This     concludes     the   discussion        of the morphological properties of medial
verbs.        Further discussion of syntactic properties of medial verbs can be found
in    4.3    and   chapters       5 and 7.    We will now turn to an exposition of the final

identified only in relation to the speaker (his/her person, and time and place
of the utterance). Personal and temporal deixis I have handled in the sections
on pronouns and temporal adverbs, while tenses will be described in 3.9.1.2.
Here, I will attempt to account for the rather versatile system of spatial
deixis that Usan employs. Some of its forms discussed here are of the utmost
importance for textual deixis. All of chapter 6 is devoted to illustrate how
Usan exploits the metaphor DISCOURSE is SPACE, even though it uses only a small
fraction of the available spatial deictics for establishing textual cohesion.
     The spatial deictics consist of four basic forms, which are intricately
linked to the geographical features of the area in which Usan is spoken. In 1.1
I have described the physical features of this area: even though the mountains
rise only to medium altitudes, the terrain is rugged. The small villages and
hamlets are located on top of the narrow ridges. The gardens are laid out on
the steep slopes.     From everywhere narrow creeks tumble down into the gorges.
Concepts such as 'up', and 'down' and 'across' are very important under such
conditions.
      Apart     from     the     concept    'here'    (=   close     to   the speaker), those three
directions define the system of spatial deixis:      (84) e 'here' , ité 'up there' , úmo 'down there',
           iré 'across there'

careless speech, ité for example, may be used where in fact a derived form would
have been more precise. The proper deictic forms may be suffixed with the
clitic -t, which does not seem to be different from the adposition -t, meaning
'in, at, on, with, for, etc' (see 3.9.2); with the suffix -ng 'given' and with a
combination of these two: -nd. The 'given' suffix -ng is used to single out a
certain item which often has been mentioned before or is understood to be given,
from a set of possible alternatives. Thus we get:     (85)    e-t      'at here'              e-ng       'this one'
             ité-t    'at up there'          ité-ng     'the one up'

             úmo-nd   'at the one down'
             iré-nd   'at the one across'     The     proper deictic forms include several derivations, which in turn may be
affixed with -t, -ng, and -nd.          These derivations specify various distances     and
terrain features.      They are only relevant for the three elevationals.          These may
be made proximal, retaining their orientation, by compounding with the              proximal

"     With nominal constituents that do not contain a Locative word, as in (82),
one has a choice as to whether one marks both the HN and the determiner with the

acceptable variant of (82) with less emphasis on the Loc. But it is also
possible to have a deictic without -t following the HN, as in (86).

"3.5.4.1       Non-scalar adjectives     Non-scalar adjectives seem to form a separate sub-class, in that they
invariably follow the head noun immediately. They are more noun-like than scalar
adjectives, and they behave similarly to material and other           non-scalar
adjectives in European languages.      Non-scalar adjectives are used for the
categories AGE, COLOUR, and some PHYSICAL PROPERTIES.
     The category AGE cannot be expressed apart from SEX.        The adjectives
denoting these categories also signal SOCIAL STATUS when referring to humans:      (51)             young unmarried    married        widowed          male         moi                    bârâi       qoi
          female         yoróu                nârom       qind6uThe    adjective       bârâi is generalized in its meaning 'grown up/important' and can
in that sense also be used with yâmângâr 'woman'.
     The non-scalar adjectives applying to animals are                      differentiated      for
when referring to adult and for species when referring to young:       (52)    wân           'young' [animal]; qamáaman 'young' [bird]
               yeim          'young' [+ one year old of pigs]

               únor          'female' [bird, animal]       Other     non-scalar      adjectives     denote social status, irrespective of sex or
age.    These are found in pairs of antonyms:       (53)    bânâm       'friend' - qaráu           'enemy'
               qau         'taboo/sacred/set apart' - arén              'non-sacred'     Other non-scalar adjectives that occur                       in    pairs   of   antonyms    can    be
categorized under AGE (or SOCIAL STATUS):

                                 sabúmTemen can be used for animate and inanimate entities. Bubun means 'for the
first time' and frequently refers to humans: munon bubun 'a new man' is someone
who is new to a certain activity. The antonym qoan 'old' denotes the opposite
of both temen and bubun.   In contrast to the terms in (54) qoan can be
intensified.   It may also be used as a temporal adverb. Presumably, its head
noun gen 'time' is so well understood that qoan by itself is used to mean 'long
ago' or 'before' (cf. 3.6.1).
     A number of non-scalar adjectives are highly restricted as far as their
collocation with head nouns is concerned. Many of them do not have a lexical
item as antonym. This seems to be the case for adjectives that express a state
different to what would be naturally expected, e.g. quum 'deaf', igug 'deaf (of
nuts)', gog6r 'orphan' (=wau gogor 'child orphan').","[83, 84]"
"     It is much harder to find instances of other semantic                        functions,   such   as
Locative (16), in coordinate constructions in Usan.     ( 16 )     nam      dirigar ba         nam   andib-t              qiyo sumburei

               vines or on a sumburei (= tree parasite) they lay their
               eggs'     The frequent occurrence of coordinated satellites is no doubt related to
the general restriction on the occurrence of peripheral terms. Notice that in
(16) the Goal relating to the predicate with the coordinated Loc is expressed in
180                          STRUCTURES AND THEIR FUNCTIONS IN USAN
a preceding clause, which creates space for the coordinate terms.
      All the above examples of coordinated terms can be                         accounted        for    by    the
general coordination schema as proposed by Dik (1980):       (17)
which expands an element α into an n-ary series of coordinated elements of                                         the
same type.
      With regard to the qualification 'of the same                        type',   one     may       raise        the
question      as     to   what     criteria      constitute        sameness.       Schachter's          (1977:90)
constraint on coordinate structures stipulates                      that     ""the        constituents         of     a
coordinate     conjunction         must belong to the same syntactic category and have the
same semantic function"". When Dik discusses syntactic and semantic                                  constraints
on    coordinate       structures,         he   points     out     that Schachter's constraint is too
strong. There are many             cases    where    complete        identity      in     surface       syntactic
category      does    not hold. This is true also for Usan, where a replacive relative
clause may be coordinated with a 'normal' NP:       (18)   morogan wamariau      wurinou qomon ne wurinou mâni

nominalized verb as Head with a regular NP:       (19)   *qirar wurinou qomon ne wurinou inau big-au eng

                        COORDINATION AND SWITCH-REFERENCE                    181
     A possible explanation of the ungrammaticality of (19) may lie in the
semantic content of a nominalized form in Usan, i.e. a form on -au may still
convey a strong portion of 'activity', which makes it appropriate as an
adjective (cf. 3.2.2). (NOTE: Perhaps a similar semantic value of the English
progressive form is responsible for the ungrammatical coordination with an
absolute (infinitive) form, as Schachter's example:     *Running and to overeat may be unhealthy)     Given the differing ease with which the various semantic functions may be
coordinated, it might be desirable to put a pragmatic condition on the general
schema (17) for Usan, namely, that this schema is not as freely applied to
satellites as to nuclear arguments. At the same time, animate constituents, even
when peripheral (e.g. Comitative), share in the preferential treatment of
nuclear arguments by the coordination schema.
     Coordination of terms does not increase the valency of a predicate, but it
does increase the participants of a state of affairs. Both the addition of terms
and the internal increment of the complexity of a term imply an increasing load
of information within a predication, which is generally kept low in Usan and
other Papuan languages (cf. 4.1.1 and 4.1.2). Possibilities and constraints on
coordination may therefore be closely related to pragmatic criteria. An increase
of information expressed per predication seems to be more tolerable when it
concerns more central semantic functions and/or animate constituents. Satellites
are peripheral to the expression of a state of affairs. Their explicit
expression implies an extra degree of news value (used here in a sense closely
related to Communicative Dynamism of the Prague School). Satellites do not occur
as freely in coordinate constructions. When they do occur in a coordinate
construction, the coordinated term is assigned Focus function. Terms with Focus
function, or terms that supply additional information (e.g. Appositions (4.4.3)
may contain coordinate constructions), allow coordination more freely than terms
that are out of Focus. This is illustrated by the given examples (16) and (18).
In (16) the Focus is on the possible locations where the given topic nam dirigar
'twigs' will be put. In (18) the coordinated Goal precedes the subject ye 'I',
which implies pragmatic prominence. We need to add another hierarchy then to (8)
and (9) as they are combined in (10):     (20)   Focus   >   Non-Focus     An inanimate peripheral term may then be increased in saliency by virtue of
its focality.

5.1.1      On so-called 'gapping' constructions     Gapping constructions involve two (or more) instances of some state of
affairs, with different sets of terms. That is to say, the semantic and
syntactic function of the terms with respect to the predicate expressing the
state of affairs are the same, but their referential meanings are different.
One could say that in 'gapping' constructions the same scene is played with
different actors and/or props, which are then contrasted with each other.
     It is the contrastive function of 'gapping' constructions that seems to me
of crucial importance. As Kuno (1976a:310) states as his assumption regarding
the intended function of Gapping: ""namely that of deleting contextually known
information and presenting contrastive (and therefore, new, unpredictable)
information."" Because of this function, there are many Usan constructions that
I believe to be related to Gapping, even if they may not look 'canonical gapping
constructions.' Beginning with Ross (1970), the theory has existed that gapping
possibilities are related to the ordering of constituents, in such a way that
SOV languages have either two possible Gapping constructions (SOV + SO and SO +
SOV) or just the one order SO + SOV. The latter case would hold for languages
that are strictly V-final. Now, Usan, even though it is strictly V-final, has
as the only possible gapping order SOV + SO, as in (21) (a); (21) (b) is
impossible.        (21) (a)     Seiru purat             wâr-a             ne   ye qomb
                     S.     bird.of.paradise shoot-3s.DS and I          Goura.pigeon               (b)   *Seiru purat             ne     ye qomb              w-amei
                       S.    bird.of.paradise and I     Goura.pigeon shoot-Is.FP      A formal account of (21) (a) may be given by the general schema of (17)
with the necessary ordering principles, as in Dik (1980:207), with the proviso
that Usan's V-final nature does NOT have the strictly V-final pattern as e.g. in
Dutch subordinate clauses. That is, Usan requires that for coordination of term
n-tuples, ( α2) .... ( αm) is expressed following the complete expression of
V( α 1 ) .
      In natural text, we also find sequences such as:        (22)   goban        u-t-ib-einer           eng wai          eng goban
               shoulder him-give-sg.Fut-3s.UF the animal the shoulder               u-t-ib-a

            'To the one who 1 may give him j a shoulder, h e j will

            and belly him-give-sg.Fut-3s.UF the belly            'And to the one who may give him a belly, a belly'     The difference between (21) (a) and (22) is that in the former the first
conjunct has the predicate in a medial verb form, whereas in the latter example
the first conjunct is a fully expressed sentence with a final verb,    receiving
final intonation. This also appears to be the case in Korafe, another Papuan
SOV language:    (23) Korafe: Mary nu isia mindira,    John nu kuta
                 M.   she taro she.ate.TP J.   he sweet.potato                   'Mary ate taro, John sweet potato'
                   (data from Cindy Farr, pers. comm.)     The occurrence of sequences such as (22) and (23) suggests that 'gapping'
constructions, in Papuan languages at least, may originate from another source
than the expansion schema (17). The fact that the first sentence in (22) forms a
complete grammatical sentence with final intonation indicates that the second
sentence is the expression of a separate predication whose predicate is not
realized. Such a non-realization rule would be similar to zero anaphora when the
appropriate constituent has been mentioned in a preceding sentence.
       Whether constructions such as in (22) and (23) are achieved by expansion or
non-realization        (see   below),   they   do   provide,   in   my view, instances of an
exclusive SOV + SO configuration for SOV languages, which Ross (19 70) and others
have    ruled   out.    Usan is a V-final language which allows very little 'leaking'
(cf. Ross 1973). The only construction which might be said to exhibit              'leaking'
involves    'reason'-clauses       following    a   grammatically    complete sentence, i.e.
following a final verb with final intonation, as in:       (24) (a)   yonou iyau um-orei
                  my    dog die-3s.FP            (b)   mi    boru nu-or    end
                  thing bad eat-3s.FP this-for
184                         STRUCTURES AND THEIR FUNCTIONS IN USAN
                   'My dog has died. (That's) because he ate something bad'     No 'first argument', i.e. Ag, Pos, etc, nor Go or Rec may follow the
predicate to which it relates. The reason-clause in (24) (b) is better analyzed
as originating in a sentence whose final verb is not realized since it is an
echo of the final verb in (24) (a). In other words, (24) is the result of the
same process that we have assumed to be responsible for (22) and (23).
     Let us now consider an example of 'gapping' with a medial verb in the first
conjunct :      (25) (a)     ye nam    bei-t      \    su-ab   igim-ine wo qasuri-t
                   I   tree axe-with    i    cut-SS be-1s.DS he knife-with             (b)   ye bei-t   nam
                   I axe-with tree                   'I am cutting the tree with an axe, he with a knife'     In 4.1.2 I pointed out that the order of the clause constituents is
relatively free, so that the difference between (25) (a) and (b) is rather
subtle with a slight preference for (25) (b). Neither the first conjunct of (25)
(a) nor the one in (25) (b) may be followed by a second truncated predication
which expresses the Goal rather than the Instrument:      (26)   *ye bei-t        nam    su-ab   igim-ine wo qug
              I    axe-with tree cut.SS be-ls.DS he black.palm               'I am/was cutting the tree with an axe, he the black palm'     As an explanation of this restriction I would suggest that 'gapping' is
primarily used with a contrastive function. I have postulated that satellites
have more news value than arguments. And contrast can only be placed on those
items that have relatively higher news value. This restriction is parallelled in
negative constructions. Givón (1979) makes clear that the implications of
negated versions of sentences such as (26) (a) and (b) are different.      (27) (a)     He ran
             (b)   He ran fast

            (b)       He d i d n ' t run fast        =     he d i d n ' t run
         That i s , (28) (b) negates p r i m a r i l y the a d v e r b i a l q u a l i f i c a t i o n . In
Bossuyt's terms (1983), "" t h e negative c a r r i e s the only 'new' information of the

     Thus, with regard to (24) and ( 2 5 ) , the second p r e d i c a t i o n should c o n t r a s t

affairs       ascribed    to     one     participant,         the second predication is sufficiently
186                     STRUCTURES AND THEIR FUNCTIONS IN USAN
expressed by a term referring to this participant and the negative. Of course,
in this case the negated state of affairs may be expressed first, with a
positive truncated predication in the second position, as in:      (31)   wuri in-ab    ig-our   eng ag-ag              end    me
             they sleep-SS be-3p.pr the near/on.the.ground the-at not             in-âb     ig-our       #   erer   end    qas
             sleep.SS be-3p.Pr          on.top the-at only             'As for where they sleep, they do not sleep near the ground,
              only high up'     It is this order of negative-positive, with the positive predication in a
'gapped' form that is highly preferred in Usan argumentation: The existence of a
certain state of affairs receives more emphasis through the contrast with a
negated similar state of affairs.
     For a sentence such as (30) (d) one might want to adopt some kind of shadow
predication schema (as suggested by Simon Dik, pers. comm.):      (32)             wâb 'shoot'v     (Seiru)Ag    (purat)Go             AND NEG            V          (ye)Ag      (••••)Go
     where the second conjunct has an empty predication which receives the
opposite existential value through the Negative operator.
     In addition, the lexical value of the Go in the second conjunct should be
empty. Empty predicates and terms should only be allowed under identity with
predicates and terms in a first conjunct. Such a solution, based upon an
expansion schema for (30) (d) seems to allow for non-realization of those
elements in the second predication that are identical to elements in the first
predication.
     But if (32) is a valid representation of the data displayed by (30) (d), it
may also be valid for examples (21) (a), (22) and (31).
     The latter two examples have fully specified final verbs in the first
predication. In (21) (a) the medial verb of the first predication has to be
marked for Different Subject following, which means that somehow the relation of
the second subject with respect to a predicate must be referred to. This would
be possible through a shadow predication as in (32). It would be more cumbersome

through the expansion schema (17) with its ordering principles. The possibility
of a non-realization solution along the lines of (32) is strengthened by
sequences of predications in which the second predicate is not identical to the
first one.
     Example (33) is taken from a text in which the previous sentences have
provided enough information for a felicitous interpretation of the protasis of
the counter-factual sentence.     (33)   in wau     me    isub-ari                      an        gâri        ende

            you only [i.e. only your problem existed], it would
            be good [i.e. we would be able to help you financially]'     It is virtually impossible to set up either a tight expansion schema or a
tight deletion rule to arrive at the coordinate construction: wau me isu-ari an
gâri, since for example the verb of the second conjunct would not be isub
'descend'.   Presumably, from the second conjuct the nominal predicate qugurau
'heavy (=problem)' , located between an and gâri has not been realized.
     Non-realization of a main predicate or term is possible when in an
(immediately) preceding expression such a predicate or term has already been
realized, as inâb igour 'they are used to sleep' in (31).","[197, 198, 199, 200, 201, 202, 203, 204, 205]"
"3.9.1.2.8       Semantics of Usan tenses       The Present (or neutral) tense refers to some state of affairs                        that      takes
place right at the time of utterance.               Philosophers might argue that the present
is always or never.           In other words, it is a fleeting           time     indication        between
the    past     and   the     future.     As soon as the present is here, it is immediately
past, i.e. in the Usan system:             near past.
       This is a fortiori the case with             punctiliar      events      and   what    have     been
termed      accomplishments      or     achievements      (cf.     Steedman     1977).    With durative
events it is different.          States and Positions are easily              perceived      to   be    the
case in the present, and so are some durative processes and actions.
       In     these   cases,    the     present   tense    may     be felicitously employed.            For
example, while one is on his way to some place one may be asked:   (122)      eret      ir-an?
              where-to go.up-2s.Pr                'Where are you going?'
                                                  [if the hearers direction is uphill]

to which one can answer:
   (123) ginam ite ir-aum
         place up go.up-ls.Pr             'I am going up to that village'
Immediately at arrival in that village one might say:
   (124) ani-mbegeib          qâmb   di-aum
         you.pl-see.sg.Fut.SS say.SS come.up-ls.Pr
           'I've come to see you'     The neutral tense in (124) in fact refers to an accomplished event, which
in the strictest sense is no longer present at the time of its utterance. The
same can be said of (12 5) which might be uttered as a comment on a preceding
statement by the same speaker disclaiming responsibility in case the hearer
would be upset by what the speaker said.
   (125)       ye     âr    qur-aum
           I    purposeless say-Is.Pr
           'I just said it'
     The fact that especially durative events can be considered to take place at
the time of an utterance is borne out by the fact that verbs in a continuative
or habitual aspect are among the most frequent to show present tense, cf.
(121).
     The neutral tense is also used in clauses expressing 'pretense', or to
express that some state of affairs is the case because one thinks another event
is true, whereas the speaker knows it is not.
     In this case the alleged reason or pretense is embedded as a quote of the
verb 'to say'(cf. 6.6), as in
   (126) yâmângâr eng der    munon woro-bai-oun    qâmb
         woman    the get.up man   them-take-ls.Pr say.SS

"7.1.1    Non-verbal negative: ue        The    negative    ue    is used primarily for non-verbal predicates, i.e.   state
predicates (4.2.10), as in:        (2) wo eng ye tain        ue
              he the I    father not               'He [or: this one] is not my father'     Since state predicates in general assert some quality about their topics,
the negative ue can be said to deny the assignment of qualities. As such, ue
may be found in non-verbal predicates which act as restrictor within terms that
relate to a verbal predicate. In that case, it does not form a constituent
negation as in (1), but appears to be a result of a relativization process of a
state predicate, as in (3) (b):      (3) (a) mutar   uber  ue
              mushroom good not                  'The mushroom is not good [=inedible]'              (b) mutar   uber    ue   eng nub    mendir-ib-ân

     The non-verbal negative may function in a similar way as English 'without',
which of course also negates a certain quality the addressee may believe that an
entity has. An interesting example is:       (4)
                  THEME                 ITEMNON-VERBAL                      PREDICATE
                  or
                  TOPIC              'I am without talk'In (4), ue appears to be a negation of existence (cf. (6)). The Usan example
(4) is very typical of Papuan languages as the equivalent of "" I have nothing to
say about t h a t "" , which implies that the speaker does not see any problem with a
certain state of affairs. Apparently, a problem or disagreement would give rise
to an argument, i.e. to speech, and so (4) is used to express 'I don't mind',
'It's OK with me'. I believe that vernacular expressions such as (4) supply a
nice example for the heavy substrata influences in Tok Pisin, which has the
equivalent expression:       (5)   mi nogat tok
             I no     talk              'I have nothing to say = I don't mind'The    'without'-sense       is also attested in (6) (a), which is the opposite of      (6)
(b).       (6) (a) munon sarau ue           eng ibeibi             gib       ig-our

274                        STRUCTURES AND THEIR FUNCTIONS IN USAN
      The quality-denying function of ue receives a natural extension to                    include
the possibility of negating existence, when            no     qualifiers   occur   in   a    state
predicate :      (7) munon ue
          man   not             'There are no men'A statement like       (7)    may     be   offered    as    an alternative to (8) to deny the
presence of 'men'.      (8) munon me    ig-our
         man      not be-3p.Pr          'The men are not (here)'Strictly speaking, (8) denies the existential presence of 'men', for example in
a village where only a woman and a few children are left, whereas (7) should
only deny the quality of 'man-hood' with respect to other beings left. Since ue
is the negator for state predicates, i.e. non-verbal material, it can also be
used to negate nominalized verbs. Since nominalization of a final verb extends
over preceding medial verbs (for a qualification of this scope, see 7.1.3), the
negative ue has the same scope.         In (7) we saw an example where the
quality-denying sense of ue is difficult to differentiate from the negation of
existence which is normally achieved by the verbal negator.      Yet, the same
difference of flavor between (7) and (8) exists also between (9) and (10), which
I try to indicate in the English gloss through the phrase 'It is not the case
that...' for the nominalized verb + ue:      (9) wau     skur-t       isub          qoyam         bai-au   ue
         child school-to descend.SS knowledge take-NOM not          'It is not the case that the children went to school and acquired

"3.2.2     Nominalization     Verbs are nominalized by affixing -au to the stem, which is at the same
time the form of the singular imperative. For the verbs of conjugations 4a and
4c this results in a change of the stem vowel /o/ into /â/, while the verbs of
conjugations 6 and 7 elide the vowel /o/ of the imperative form (see table 1 ) .
     Nominalized verbs function as nouns or as adjectives. In this respect,
Usan nominalized verbs resemble the progressive participles of English and other
Indo-European languages. Compare the English forms in (15) with the Usan forms
in (16).     (15) (a)       Skating is very popular in Holland

"     In this section I have not quoted material            from    other    Papuan    languages.
But on the basis of what I have seen in the quoted papers and monographs, it can
safely be said that the use of verbatim and generic recapitulation, coordinating
connectives      and   demonstratives,      with   or    without     postpositional       clitics
indicating causal relations, in various languages parallel the features of Usan.
The examples (143) and (144) indicate that the form eng (and its derivations) is
no longer as     clearly subordinating as it is with relative and adverbial clauses
(recall    the   history of English 'but', 6.4). This impression seems to me due to
the fact that we normally do not perceive          a    full   sentence      in   a   subordinate
relation    to   another   sentence.     For   this     reason,    the     English    conjunction
'therefore' or the Dutch equivalent 'daar-om' are not analyzed as subordinators.
270                  STRUCTURES AND THEIR FUNCTIONS IN USAN
But, again, the deictics 'there' and 'daar' are easily seen as pro-forms for
complete predications.
     Again, we see the metaphor DISCOURSE is SPACE illustrated: what is given in
the immediate visual or audio field functions as the ground for the figure of
the asserted statement or question.
7      Sentential modes7.0    Introduction     In this chapter I will discuss the three main operators on a predication by
which a speaker can express his/her opinion with respect to the truth status of
that predication. In other words, a speaker may want to deny a certain aspect
of a predication; he may want to convey his uncertainty or doubt with regard to
an element of a state of affairs; or, he may want to express his wish that some
state of affairs will come about.        In this way I have given a generally
functional description of negative, interrogative and imperative. I will try to
indicate what an Usan speaker wants to achieve when he uses one of these
operators.
     With respect to negation, for example, we can say that a speaker believes
that the addressee may (have) form(ed) an opinion about a certain situation
which the speaker thinks he should rectify.         Likewise, in the case of
interrogatives, a speaker assumes that certain elements of a state of affairs
are the case and he wants to be informed about some element he lacks information
on.   With imperatives, finally, the speaker must assume that the addressee is
capable of bringing about some state of affairs that the speaker finds
desirable, or, with negative imperatives of course, undesirable. These three
sentential modes are discussed together since their scopes in Usan sentences are
the   same   with respect to the syntactic functions of coordination and
subordination.","[287, 288, 289]"

the plural morpheme -ri (cf. 3.9.1.3.4).        When we also consider that other
members of the Numugenan family have ya- and na- for lsg and 2pl, we may see the
same number-conditioned ablaut which Haiman suggested, and which is shown in the
Finisterre-Huon group (5), also at work in the Madang-Adelbert Range sub-phylum.
This conjecture is not very plausible, however, since the plural fronting in
Usan can not be attested in the pronoun root.     It may be that the plural
formation in the Madang-Adelbert sub-phylum is effected by agglutination.
Compare the Siroi pronouns (Wells 1978:19) as in (7) with Usan (6).

     Z'graggen lists dual pronouns for the languages of the Adelbert Range
super-stock. But he makes explicit that for many languages the formation
consists of nothing else than the plural pronoun plus the numeral 'two'. Usan
is typical of this group. It does not show any evidence of a specific dual
category, as it may be recognized in Siroi (7), which represents the Rai Coast
stock of the same sub-phylum.","[33, 34]"

Comparison of (13) and (14) shows that primary stress on the quantifiers other
than the particular one allows for an interpretation of constitutent negation.
Primary stress on the negative morpheme constitutes sentence negation; but in
the case of the particular quantifier (14) (c), this is identical to a
constituent negation. The result is that both (14) (a) and (14) (c) describe
the situation where nobody went down.
     As already indicated in 5.1.1, sentence negation has as its primary scope
whatever special elements a predication contains, such as satellites and
adverbials, not the nuclear arguments, unless specifically indicated. As Givón
(1979:113-114) has pointed out, logicians and linguists may see that it is
possible to negate both the presupposition and the assertion, so that 'The king
of France is not bald' may mean: 'There is no king of France and so he can't be
bald'; but most speakers of natural languages would only take it to mean: 'there
is a king of France and he is not bald'. The reason for this fact is clearly
pragmatic, related to the economy of communication. If a speaker would deny the
validity of a state of affairs, why would he at the same time communicate
embellishments of that state of affairs which he claims as non-existent in the
first place? Thus, in (15) the distance is not said to be incapable of becoming
shorter. It is only claimed that it will not happen quickly.        (15) qumu-big        is-inen         eng ai      tâp     degen âib,

transportation      (e.g. Lakoff 1969; Lindholm 1969), by which the negative is said
to be transported out of the complement of            sentence    (16)    (a)   into   the   main
clause, (16) (b), without change of meaning.
278                       STRUCTURES AND THEIR FUNCTIONS IN USAN      (16) (a)    I think John won't leave until tomorrow           (b)    I don' t think John will leave until tomorrowThis is argued by Lindholm on the basis of the ungrammaticality of 'John will
leave until tomorrow'. Horn (1978) adduces evidence from a number of languages
to suggest that negative transportation may be a universal rule of language. As
Horn himself points out (1978:181), however, equivalents of (16) (b) are
universally weaker than those of (16) (a) in the assertive force of the
negative. This means that by uttering (16) (b) the speaker does not say what he
thinks, whereas in (16) (a) he asserts what the content of his thought is. In
other words, (16) (a) implies (16) (b), but (16) (b) does not imply (16) (a),
which is schematically represented in (19). This is true of Usan:      (17) (a) wo me      yar-ib-a              end      misir        ig-oum
                 he not come-sg.Fut-3s the.at thought hear-1s.Pr                 'I think that he will not come'           (b) wo yar-ib-a                end         misir      me   ig-oum

                 'I don't think that he will come'Examples (17) (a) and (b) are elicited, and I doubt whether they would actually
occur in that form. A more natural way to express thought content makes use of
the qâmb-construction (cf. 6.7):      (18) (a) unor       igo-i      ne   wau         ger watu        yâ-gâb     igo

not warrant a rule deriving one from the other, can be represented by the schema
in (19).     (19) (a) [Main clause   (NEG Subord. cl)] = [NEG Main            (Subord. cl)]
          (b) [NEG Main cl. (Subord. cl)]          =    [Main cl     (NEG Subord. cl)]              These implicational statements hold for complex predications
             when the predicate of the main clause = Speech verb (4.2.5)
              or a Perception verb (4.2.6).","[293, 294, 295, 296, 297]"
"6.5   Cause and reason      The notions of cause and reason (and, of course, purpose (6.6)) are
semantically related.    Davidson (1968:92) states:       ""The    most   primitive
explanation of an event gives its c a u s e "" . True causal laws are distinguished
by the fact that they are inductively confirmed by their instances, Davidson
says.    A reason, on the other hand, involves human reasoning: ""When someone
does something for a reason, he can be characterized as (a) having some sort of
a pro attitude toward actions of a certain kind and (b) believing (or knowing
                                         SUBORDINATION                                  249
etc) that his action is of that k i n d "" (1968:79). Davidson proceeds then to say
that a primary reason for an action, i.e. any state that fulfils the condition
(a) and (b), is the cause of the action.
     Briefly then, the main difference between a cause and a reason lies in the
fact that the apodosis of a reason requires the feature [ + Control]. In Hua
(Haiman 1980:450-455) this difference is nicely grammaticalized. A relative
clause construction suffixed for benefactive case presupposes a voluntary action
to bring the state of affairs in the apodosis about, whereas a direct causal
consequence between two states of affairs is expressed by the ergative case
marking on the RC which expressed the causal state of affairs. A medial verb
conjunction is neutral in that it does not signal a causal relationship, but it
allows a causal inference.
     Usan does not make as clear a distinction (but see below the constraint on
the conjunction with gab 'see'). In chapter 5 we have already seen that medial
verbs are used for coordination, which, being neutral, allows for various
semantic inferences depending on the content of the conjoined predications.
This is again illustrated by:       (98)    munon uyan qas   ni-ari         qen   ubur-âb   igo   e

               construction signalled by the final demonstrative:

               no time left')       In 3.8.2 I showed that the periphrastic verb wogub 'cease.SS' has causal or
reason overtones in its expression of complete aspect. In this sense it           may   be
less   coordinating     than    a   straight    medial verb conjunction, compare (99) and
(100). The medial verb iet in (99) does not necessarily have the same tense             as
the final verb. In (100) the near past tense is automatically applied to asiema.       (99) bug e     mom    iet         wogub    bug ger

with which semantic function cause or reason is lined up.       In many Papuan
languages it is either the instrument, beneficiary or locative.
     Waskia (Ross and Paol 1978)             appears     to use the instrument marker -se,
affixed to the far deictic mu:

notes this for all languages of the Finisterre-Huon group).","[266, 267, 268, 269]"
"     Constructions indicating which constituents receive Focus are         often
illustrated by answers to questions (cf. Dik 1980, Dik et al. 1981). Chomsky
(1971) and Creider (1979) seem to equate Focus with that part of a sentence that
166                       STRUCTURES AND THEIR FUNCTIONS IN USAN
expresses the assertion about a Topic. According to Creider, ""rules that move
constituents to the left are topicalizing, and Focusing rules move constituents
to the right."" He makes this point explicit by saying that ""Right-dislocation
is, in fact, the exception that proves the rule, for Right-dislocation is
primarily a rule for 'afterthought' topics"" (Creider 1979:11). But clearly,
the assigning of Focus is independent of sentence position; as the possibility
of contrasted Topics, which occupy the initial position, illustrates.
     Typically, in information questions the speaker determines the Topic for a
felicitous answer to be given by the addressee. Consequently, what is being
asserted about the Topic normally constitutes the more salient information, and
as such is likely to receive Focus, by whatever means a language allows.
     This characterization forms a plausible explanation of the Tail or
""afterthought"" topic phenomenon. After a speaker has expressed a certain
predication, he gives of his own account an answer to a possible question which
the addressee may have with regard to a possibly vague constituent. As such, the
tail represents additional information, which even if it          contains   old
information or a given topic, is asserted rather than presupposed.
     Such additional identification of an item does not need to wait until a
predication is fully expressed. I am referring to the phenomenon of Apposition,
which to my knowledge is not very often talked about in the linguistic
literature. Yet, appositional constructions are ubiquitous, and not only in
unplanned discourse. Typically, appositions are used to supply additional
information, in order to either remove uncertainty about the referent of the HN
(97), or strengthen the intent of the reference (98).      (97)   ibâg           igum-une wuri     Mamari wonou ur           eng Qoir

             'All of us, young men, young women, and old men and old
             women, none of us should stay home'     The second apposition in (98) is an instance of a              quantifier     conveying    a
partitive interpretation (cf. 3.5.3).
     A strengthening effect is also achieved when a more general referring
device follows a more specific one, as in the case of a pronoun copy following
an explicit NP:     (99)    eâb      igim-ine ne   tain       wo    yâ-nâmb   wogub ...
