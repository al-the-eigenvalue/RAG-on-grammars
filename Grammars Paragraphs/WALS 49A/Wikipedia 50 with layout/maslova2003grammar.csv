The monographic description (Krejnovich 1958) is concerned mainly
with the grammar of Tundra Yukaghir, with references to the Kolyma
Yukaghir materials collected by Jochelson; (Krejnovich 1979) also
sketches the Tundra Yukaghir grammar.
Note that if my description of a phenomenon attested by Jochelson
and/or Krejnovich differs from that suggested by these scholars in more
than the degree of detail, I usually indicate the deviation from the pri-
mary description simply by ""cf."" in front of the relevant reference, with-
out going into the discussion of the controversy, in order not to over-
load the book with details which are hardly interesting for its potential
readers. However, if the differences appear to be significant, they are
described explicitly.
The examples from published texts are indicated by a letter (""F"" for
(Nikolaeva 1989), ""K"" for (Maslova 2001), and ""T"" for the texts in-
cluded in this book) followed by the number of the text (according
to the sources' numbering). The transcription of Nikolaeva's examples
(which are presented in Cyrillic-based orthography) is mine. Note that
a number of examples from (Nikolaeva 1989) contain some deviations
from the published source, which reflects the results of discussing these
sentences with informants; a reference to the published source has been
preserved if such deviations are relatively insignificant (including cor-
rections of misprints). The examples from unpublished texts appear
without any indication of the source, the examples elicited in interviews
are indicated by the letter ""F.
The materials published by Irina Nikolaeva in 1997 have not been in-
cluded in the corpus of examples employed for this grammar precisely
because I have had no chance to check them with other informants.
For the same reason, I employ the examples cited by E. A. Krejnovich
only in exceptional cases, simply because he normally does not indi-
cate whether a particular example has been elicited in an interview or
has been attested in a text. Furthermore, he mentions that he ""con-
584    Notes       structed"" some of his Kolyma Yukaghir examples on the basis of other
       data (1982:249); this method of exemplification is never employed in
       this grammar.
 6.    These percentages are based on data collected in 1987 by a joint expedi-
       tion of the Institute of Linguistics and the Institute of Ethnography of
       the USSR Academy of Sciences (St .Petersburg branches) and published
       by Nikolay Vakhtin (1992:50, Table 1).
 7.    See (Vakhtin 1992:57-58) for a detailed description of how these ratings
       were obtained.
 8.    In their reviews to an earlier version of this grammar, Bernard Com-
       rie and Christian Lehmann suggested that this system might be more
       appropriately described as advanced tongue root (rather than palatal)
       harmony. Since a justifiable choice between these options could only
       be based on a thorough phonetic investigation of the phenomenon, I
       have opted for the term traditionally adopted in the Yukaghir studies
       (Collinder 1940:80-88; Krejnovich 1982:20-21; Nikolaeva and Helimsky
       1996:157).
 9.    The voiced obstruent j z j does not occur in morpheme-final position.
10.    The final / n / of the verb stem mon- 'speak, say' is dropped before the
       morph -d'e, e.g., mo-d'e Ί said', mo-d'ek 'You (SG) said', etc.
11.    The allomorph -j of the attributive marker -jE does not occur after
       consonants.
12.    The Resultative marker, the Stative marker, the copula ö-, and the final
       -δ- in the qualitative and quantitative verbs are notably similar, so that,
      at least diachronically, they might be assumed to instantiate the same
      morpheme (see 5.3.6.1). Then, the phonologically unmotivated alterna-
      tion / j / ~ /d'/ is restricted to a small set of morphological environ-
      ments. A further diachronic hypothesis might be that the morphemes
      constituting these environments used to contain a final sonorant, which
      triggered this alternation (see 3.3.1). This hypothesis is supported by
      Tundra Yukaghir data, where final / l / of the Resultative marker and of
      qualitative stems like in (67) is still preserved in some contexts (Kre-
      jnovich 1982:98-99); see also 6.3.6.
13.   That is why there is no special chapter on adverbs in this grammar.
14.   Krejnovich (1982:105) describes the forms of ""degree of comparison"" for
      qualitative verbs. According to his observations, some nominal forms
      of the verb (referred to as Subject Nominal and Relative Nominal in
      the present grammar, see 6.1.3.6-6.1.3.7) can signify a higher degree
      of quality, especially when combined with the nominal Augmentative
      marker (see 5.6.1.2).
15.   See 5.5.5.2 on integration of Russian adjectives into Yukaghir grammar.
16.   Small capitals denote consonants that can undergo devoicing after a
                                                                   Notes    585       final voiceless obstruent of a stem, as described in 5.3.2.1.
17.    In this sentence, the Plural marking on the verb is controlled by the
       Locative NP; for a description of such constructions, see 12.1.2.3.
18.    Krejnovich (1982:249) suggests that the A participant in Kolyma Yuk-
       aghir may get the Predicative marking as well; however, his examples
       of this phenomenon contain detransitivized verbs (with the suffix -ze-,
       see 6.4.4.2), so that the Predicative marker is in fact attached to the S
       participant.
19.    For Ο marking in non-finite clauses, see 9.1.2.2.
20.    Krejnovich (1982:253; 256) observes a correlation between the choice
       of -(e)k on the head and the presence of an attributive modifier; this
       correlation is in accordance with the functional account suggested here.
21.    Krejnovich (1982:250-251; 256-257) considers presence vs. absence of a
       (lexical) noun modifier as the major factor which determines the choice
       of the Accusative vs. Instrumental marking.
22.    The combination u0+i70- 'child+be-' is apparently lexicalized with the
       meaning 'be young'
23.    The verb inflection has been described by Jochelson (1905) and discussed
       by Krejnovich (1982:184-216). Krejnovich (1982:201-208), in contrast to
       (Jochelson 1905), claims that the transitive verb in Kolyma Yukaghir
      has the SF form in -I. This claim strongly contradicts my data, see
       (Maslova 1997) for details and discussion. The absence of the transitive
      SF paradigm in Kolyma Yukaghir represents one of the major divergent
      features between the Yukaghir languages, as Tundra Yukaghir has a
      specialized transitive SF form with zero inflection (Krejnovich 1955;
       1982:209-210).
24.   Krejnovich (1982:149-151) includes the form in -τη both in the Inter-
      rogative and in the Imperative paradigm; see 13.3.1.1 and 13.3.2 for
      Interrogative applications of this form.
25.   See 5.4.1.3, 12.2 for further examples and discussion.
26.   This is a clear point of divergence between Kolyma and Tundra Yuk-
      aghir. In the latter, the affirmative pre-verb is employed much more
      frequently and can be analyzed as Predicate Focus marker (Maslova
      1989; Comrie 1992; Fortescue 1996).
27.   The -ge- ~ -h- ~ -j- alternation in the third person Conditional DS con-
      verbs instantiates the same morphophonemic rule as the alternation of
      the Accusative marker after the Possessive marker (see 5.1.3); in fact,
      the Accusative marker may be assumed to have developed from the
      generic locative marker.
28.   According to Krejnovich (1982:167), the forms in -l-ge(ne) are used with
      the singular subject and the forms in -l-u-ke(ne) express the plurality
      of subject. This correlation is not confirmed by my data. The form in
586   Notes     -l-u-ge(ne) is absent from the paradigm presented by Krejnovich.
29. Normally, the controlling clause is the next clause of a chain. See 10.1.1
    for further details.
30. In fact, these suffixes might have been described as expressing Aktion-
     sarten. Krejnovich (1982:121ff) describes all the suffixes under discus-
    sion in this chapter as sposby protekaniya dejstviya (i.e., Aktionsarten).
31. It should be noted that the Result Nominal cannot be analyzed as the
    Action Nominal form of the Resultative (although formally it might be
    possible), just because the Resultative formation can be applied to a se-
    mantically restricted class of verbs (see 3.6.2), while the Result Nominal
    form is available for any verb.
32. In Tundra Yukaghir two variants of the regular causative suffix, -s- and
     -se-, are distributed according to the general morphophonemic rule de-
    scribed in 5.3.4.1 (see Krejnovich 1982:68; Maslova 1993:273).
33. See 5.3.1.2.3 on the /d'/ ~ /n/ alternation.
34. My informants seemed to be able to construct the form by attaching
    the nominal Instrumental marker to a pronominal stem, but not to use
    it, and it does not occur in texts.
35. Here the Free Possessive form functions as a nominal modifier (see <9.2.1
    on this construction).
36. Notably, this nominalizer was rendered as -bon by W.Jochelson (1900),
    which makes it possible to posit the original form *b0n.
37. This meaning is rendered by the noun k0nme 'mate; the other'.
38. In one example in [F9], the temporal demonstrative form tudä appears
    to be used as a noun modifier ('former""), see (571b). Since there are
    no other examples of this sort, this phenomenon is not discussed in the
    grammar.
39. In this chapter, the internal structure of complex NPs is indicated by
    angle brackets in the interlinear gloss.
40. The Possessive Attributive marking (2.3.2) constitutes an exception to
    this rule.
41. In this chapter, two separate referential entities invoked by an NP with
    nominal modifier are called 'Possessor"" and ""Possessed"", independently
    of the exact semantics of the relation between them.
42. This is about the hero of a fairy-tale who has a bubble for a head, and
    that is why his name is Bubblehead.
43. The thing is a straw and a worm at the same time.
44. This rule does not cover the cases of pronominal Possessive marking, as
    described in 2.2.1.1.
45. This meaning is not ruled out by cultural knowledge, since polygamy
    used to be allowed in the Yukaghir tribes.
46. As described in 2.1.2, the construction is ambiguous between the posses-
                                                                        Notes    587       sive and the apposition interpretations, so the reading 'the small goose's
       daughter' is also possible.
47.    This formulation does not take into account the possessive use of the
       zero marking, since in this case Attributive marking is not an option.
48.    This option was suggested to me by Bernard Comrie.
49.    Note that the Comitative markers in this example introduce the sec-
       ondary participant of a reciprocal situation (see 9.2.8); two Comitative
       participants are conjoined by the connective adverb.
50.    See Note 127.
51.    In this chapter, the core participant roles are shown by indexes A and Ο
       in the interlinear gloss unless they are recoverable from the case marking.
52.    See 5.4.1.6 on the semantic difference between the Accusative proper
       and the O-marking Instrumental
53.    This phenomenon was described by Krejnovich as ""quasi-ergativity""
       (1982:232).
54.    I am grateful to Maria Polinsky for drawing my attention to this issue
       many years ago.
55.    A special case not dealt with here is represented by relativization of the
       Possessor (see 11.3.1.4 for details).
56.    This meaning is impossible for Nominal clauses, simply because the head
       denotes a situation (not a countable referential entity).
57.    Note that this property is similar to topicality in Givon's sense (i.e., topic
       continuity and persistence), with the qualification that the structuring
       of a text into episodes must be taken into account.
58.    The only exception may be the first and second person pronouns, which
      tend to trigger Accusative marking in all instances, see (609a), (612a).
      In my corpus, there are no examples of Neutral (= Pronominal Ac-
      cusative) marking of these pronouns with third-person A. It should be
      noted, however, that my informants do rate the Neutral option gram-
      matical in such cases. Apart from this, the Accusative marking of the
      first and second person pronouns can be viewed as an instantiation of
      the more general rule suggested here, insofar as they tend to refer to the
      most prominent entities in any episode they occur.
59.   An entity is taken to ""occur"" in some clause if it is involved in the
      situation being described, independently of whether· it is represented by
      an overt NP within that clause.
60.   Note that the Accusative NP in such examples may represent the Ο
      constituent of the finite clause, cf. ίθ.1.3.1, 10.1.3.3.
61.   This property is shared by the Dative Experiencer as well (see 2.7.1).
62.   To be more precise, there is no convincing way to draw the distinc-
      tion between a sequence of independent clauses and a sentence built by
      juxtaposition of finite clauses.
588    Notes63.    The term ""clause conjunction"" is used here to refer to any syntactic link
       between two or more clauses all of which have the same illocutionary
       function.
64.    In the latter function, it is opposed to specialized adverbial clauses, a
       relatively minor strategy for clausal modification of propositions (see
       IIA,    13.5.3.1).
65.    Some deviations from the strictly subject-oriented switch-reference pro-
       cedure are described in 14-1.3).
66.    ""Perch"" is interpreted as a proper name within the context of this fairy
       tale, hence the Nominative form in the Focus position.
67.    In this example, the detransitivized verb leT)-de- 'eat' is used despite the
       presence of the direct object; this deviation is presumably entailed by
       the Desiderative suffix which is typically used with the detransitivized
       verb, but not with its transitive counterpart (leg- 'eat').
68.    The linear structure is posited for the DS clause and the controlling
      finite clause. The relation between the SS clause and the DS clause is
       more appropriately described in terms of nesting, see 2.4.2 for a further
       discussion of such examples.
69.   In this example, the underlined NP fills the Ablative slot of the verb
       loijde- 'separate (from)', which is absent from the pattern of the verb
      paja- 'carry'.
70.   Note that this application of the ordinary chaining is possible only under
      the specific mode of reference (1.2).
71.   This function appears to be fairly typical for sentence-initial temporal
      clauses across languages (Thompson and Longacre 1985:212).
72.   See 12.2.4 for a description of ss-chains with shared Focus.
73.   The glosses for predictive conditional constructions are based on the
      context, as well on (Russian) translations provided by informants.
74.   In this example, the controller of switch reference is the Possessor of the
      finite-clause subject, see 14-1.3.2 for a description of this phenomenon.
75.   This example is one of very few exceptions from the rule of switch ref-
      erence: the DS form is used despite the shared subject.
76.   The term ""complementation"" refers to constructions where a clause de-
      noting a situation or fact fills a valence slot of the main verb (Noonan
      1985:42). Note that two of the three nominal verb forms employed
      for complementation, the Result Nominal (6.1.3.4) and the Prospective
      Nominal (6.1.3.5), can denote entities as well. In this case, they func-
      tion like ordinary NPs and can appear in a clause independently of the
      valence properties of the main verb. Such constructions are outside the
      scope of this section.
77.   However, see 2.2 for a group of verbs taking the Supine complements.
78.   This is the only type of phase verb existing in Yukaghir: other phase
                                                                       Notes    589       meanings are expressed morphologically (see 6.3). See also 2.1 for an
       alternative complementation pattern for the verbs of termination.
79.    Thus, this construction might be described in terms of subject-to-
       subject raising.
80.    Note that the nominal complement of an intransitive verb of termina-
       tion fills the S slot of the matrix clause; in the pattern with converb, this
       slot is filled by the primary participant of the complement clause situ-
       ation. Thus, this construction might be described in terms of subject-
       to-subject raising.
81.    See 9.2.7.2.3 for the alternative pattern for the verb erd'i- 'want'.
82.    The Applicative may be thus taken as a morphological marking of the
       subject-to-object or object-to-object raising.
83.    There is a single interview example of relativization of the Dative con-
       stituent (with the Passive Attributive form, see 6.1.3.3), yet there is
       no text evidence confirming this possibility. It should be noted that the
       relativization of constituents other than core participants belongs to the
       class of phenomena which do not lend themselves to reliable ""interview""
      investigation, at least not in the case of Yukaghir; the only thing which
      can be said is that such constructions are not produced readily and are
      not attested in texts. No statements of absolute grammatical constraints
      can be made; yet even if such constructions are grammatically possible,
      they are far more ""marginal"" then Locative relativization and Possessor
      relativization.
84.   The only attested example is controversial, see comments to the sentence
      in (745).
85.   Note that in this example the Russian word svad'ba 'wedding' is used
      instead of the Yukaghir Action Nominal form n'e+mid'ul 'talcing each
      other' with apparently similar meaning, which makes it possible to sug-
      gest that here this word refers not to the action itself, but to the place
      of festive activities.
86.   Note that for same-subject situations, this meaning is expressed by
      means of the Perfective Converb, see 10.2.2.
87.   Otherwise, the causal relationship can be expressed by means of the
      Imperfective SS form; see 10.2.4.1.
88.   This property distinguishes a nominal predicate with the bound copula
      from the Stative form constructed with the same marker (see 5.5.5.2).
89.   Note that Predicative marking on the object is impossible in this con-
      struction, presumably because of the Predicative marking on the verb
      form.
90.   Krejnovich (1982:208-209) considers this construction a part of the
      Focus-marking system (for A Focus marking, which cannot be achieved
      by means of the regular grammatical Focus construction, see 12.2.1).
590     Notes        That approach is not accepted in this grammar because of significant
        differences in the role these constructions play in the grammar and dis-
        course. Most importantly, the construction with the Result Nominal
       is not obligatory in the environments which trigger compulsory Focus
       marking on the S/O participant (see 12.3.1); see also (Maslova 1997)
       for further details.
 91.   The ""locative"" pattern for predication of possession is presumably in-
       duced or at least strongly supported by Russian influence, where such
       a pattern constitutes the major option.
 92.   Note that a logically possible variant of dealing with such a situation
       would be to put the Focus Ο constituent in the clause-initial position,
       before the A constituent (which would have been then included into
       the scope of assertion). Yet this variant is prohibited by the word-order
       rules, i.e., this constituent order is not allowed in the Focus construction;
       see 5.1.5.1.
 93.   This ne can be assumed to be just the Russian negative marker.
 94.   Krejnovich (1982:151) gives the whole person/number paradigm of this
       verb, yet all forms but those of second person appear to be out of use.
 95.   In most instances these word order options cannot be distinguished (just
       because the subject is very often omitted).
 96.   For examples of questions to the S/O constituent, see 1,8.3.1.1.
 97.   Note that the phonological integrity of the complex qodo-l'e- is indicated
       by the alternation of the final / e / with /&/ before the inferential marker,
       which shows that the stem as a whole belongs to the class of back stems,
       see 5.2.4.1).
 98.   The combination el+jüke can be fused into ejüke 'not far'.
 99.   The interrogative pronoun kin 'who' does not take the negative prefix.
100.   This use of the manner question word is quite typical for colloquial
       Russian.
101.   Note that the possessive relationship between the subject of the main
       clause and that of the subordinate clause is expressed by means of the
       bound (non-reflexive) Possessive marking (see (893)).
102.   Note that the verbs I'e- 'be' and ä- 'make' can also combine with Inter-
       rogative adverbials to build questions to predicates (15.2.2.2).
103.   The omitted piece of the text represents the direct speech (what the
       brother was saying while he was crying).
104.   Thus, the grammatical Focus shows a predicate-like behavior; see 12.2
       on the syntactic status of the Focus.
105.   Thus, such a quantifier shows the same behavior as the grammatical
       Focus; see 8.3 on the semantics of this construction.
106.   Note that the comitative strategy of NP conjunction implies the single-
       event interpretation.
                                                                Notes   591107. This example involves an unexpected OF form in the first clause (the
     case marking and the word order indicate rather topicalization of the Ο
     constituent). Presumably, the narrator changed his plan: he was going
     to speak about karbasses, but then decided to mention that other people
     made other kind of boats.

Introduction
1. Kolyma Yukaghir and its genetic affiliation
Kolyma Yukaghir is spoken by about 50 people in the settle-
ments Nelemnoye and Zyryanka, Upper Kolyma district, Yaku-
tia (Sakha) Republic and in Seymchan and Balygychan, Maga-
dan region, Russia. Until very recently, Kolyma Yukaghir has not
been written; the writing system used for the first publication of
Yukaghir folklore (Nikolaeva 1989) and currently employed in the
school in Nelemnoye is based on the Cyrillic alphabet. This gram-
mar describes the variety of Kolyma Yukaghir spoken by the oldest
generation of Yukaghirs in Nelemnoye.
   Kolyma Yukaghir is one of two existing Yukaghir languages
(which used to be referred to as dialects of Yukaghir in the liter-
ature). Another Yukaghir language, Tundra Yukaghir, is spoken
mainly in the settlements Andryushkino and Kolymskoye, Lower
Kolyma district, Yakutia. The Yukaghir languages are convention-
ally considered a genetically isolated group; yet they can probably
be affiliated with the Uralic family (Angere 1956; Bouda 1941;
Collinder 1940, 1960, 1965; Nikolaeva 1988a; 1988b).","[8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19]"
"4.1.2. The Nominative case
The Nominative noun phrase represents the S participant (154),
the A participant (155), or the Ο participant. The latter use is
possible if A is 1 st or 2nd person (156) and in a non-finite clause
(157).19

            gO-PFV-INFR(3SG)
            'The bear broke that stick and went away.'
The Nominative is used with Possessive noun phrases (158), proper
nouns (159) and third person pronouns (160) in the predicative
function (158) and in the Focus function (159), (160) (see Chapter
12 for further details on these syntactic functions).

            of their hitting the target)' [F6]

            he        wait-OF:3SG
            'He was the one she was waiting for.'
The Nominative non-Possessive form is used as the possessive
modifier (see also 8.2.1-8.2.2)·.(161)    pulut num0                'old man's house'
         met terike arjd'e         'my wife's eyes'
         comparnä azü              'language of ravens'The Nominative case is used for vocative noun phrases:
 (162)      pulut,     mit colhoro sejre-s'
            old man, our hare       run.away-PFV:iNTR:3SG
            O l d man, our hare has run away.' [F13]
The Nominative case has some other uses which are described else-
where in the grammar: (a) argument of the copula (see 12.1.1.2),
(b) apposition (5.2.1.2), (c) argument of postpositions (7.3, 5.5.2).
                                                    Functions     of the cases   914.1.3. The Predicative case
The Predicative noun phrase is the nominal predicate (163) or the
Focus of a clause (Krejnovich 1982: 184; 232ff). Only S (164)
and Ο (165) can acquire the Predicative marking (0.1.1.2; cf. also
Note 18). The Predicative case is incompatible with Possessive
noun phrases, proper names, and third person pronouns, which
take the Nominative case in these functions (see (158)-(160)).
(163)      üjs'i          omo-s'e          soromo-lek
          workman         [good-ATTR]      person-PRED
           'The workman is a good person.' [F50]
(164)      irk-id'e       ju0-de-ge     sä-pe-lek           ohö-iji-l
           [one-iTER see-3SG-DS] tree-PL-PRED               stand-3PL-SF
           'Once he saw that there were trees.' [F31]
(165)      met tet-in         saqale-lek    kej-te-me
           I     you-DAT fox-PRED give-FUT-OF:lSG
           Ί will give you a fox.' [F52]
The Predicative marker has two variants, -lek and-(e)k, which are
formally distinguished only with vowel-final stems and in the Plu-
ral form (see Table 10, 1.4.1). There is a clear functional dis-
tinction between these variants which subsumes two interrelated
factors: 20
   First, the short variant is used if the narrow information focus
(e.g., the focus of contrast) falls on a modifier, rather than on the
noun phrase as awhole:
(166) a. kukki        vosemnadcaV          nodo azü-k
          cuckoo eighteen                  bird   language-PRED
           lejdi-mele
           know-OF:3SG
           'The cuckoo knew eighteen bird languages.' [F5]
        b. o,      nahä    omo-s'e         soromo-k             kel-u-l
          I n t j [very    good-ATTR] person-PRED           come-0-SF
           'Wow, a very good person has come.' [F15]
92   Chapter 5. Nominal   morphology         c. tat    qon-u-t             il'l'e-l        soromo    cuge-k
            [CA go-0-SS:iPFv] other-ANR person                   trace-PRED
            num-mele
            find-OF:3SG
            'Then she went and found traces of other
            people.' [F54]
The relevance of this factor is indirectly shown by the fact that
only the short variant is possible in question-word questions with
a question word modifying a noun (cf. 12.3.1.1):
 (167)      qodi-mie       pajpe-k                l'e-t-u-l?
            what-QLT woman-PRED                   be-FUT-O-SF?
            'What woman would it be?' [F49]
Secondly, the formal opposition in question is employed to express
the distinction between the true predicative and the referential use
of noun phrases. The Predicative noun phrase in -lek ascribes a
property to (i.e., classifies) some entity.In other words, an example
like (165) might be appropriately rendered as 'The thing I will
give to you is a fox'. The variant in -ek signifies the referential use
(i.e., the Focus NP introduces a referential entity); this is shown
by the fact that only this variant can be used if the noun phrase
is modified by a numeral, in particular by the numeral irkin 'one':
 (168) a. tat      äj     qon-de-ge       cuge-ge       irk-in      qodö-d'e

            'She kept going and found a hole.' [F4]
                                                   Functions    of the cases   93       c. tat     aji   I'e-r/i-de-ge ataq-un       ibiligie-k

          'After having been there for some more time, two
          eagle-owls flew overhead.' [K5]
4.1.4. The Accusative case
The Accusative case is used to mark the Ο participant, under the
condition that A is third person (otherwise the Nominative case
is used, see 4.1.2):
(169) a. colhorä-die-gele       tä      sasil-ge
          hare-                 there   snare-LOC
          i-de-m
          get.caught-CAUS-TR:3SG
          'He caught the hare in the snare there.' [Fl4]
       b. titte cül-gele    min-ijä
          their meat-ACC take-3PL:TR
          'They took their meat.' [F48]
        c. tet   kimm met-kele kudede-m
           your whip me-ACC kill-TR:3SG
           'Your whip has killed me.' [F19]
The Accusative marking is compatible with pronouns, proper
nouns, Possessive noun phrases and definite noun phrases (includ-
ing generic reference, as in (170a)); if a noun phrase is indefinite,
the Instrumental case is used instead (cf. Krejnovich 1982:254-255,
see also Note 21).
   There can be two Accusative noun phrases in a clause if some
kind of possessive or part-whole relationship holds between them
(cf. 5.4.2.2 for a designated body-part form).

               'All fishes listen to Perch's word.' [Tl]
The Accusative can mark the recipient (171a) and the addressee
(171b), the functions most commonly fulfilled by the Dative case
(see 4.2.1,     9.2.4).

4.1.5. The Pronominal Accusative Case
First and second person pronouns have a special Pronominal Ac-
cusative form in -ul (see 7.1.1.1), which is used for the Ο partici-
pant under the same conditions as the Nominative form of nouns,
i.e., if A is first or second person (172a)-(172b), or, occasionally,
in non-finite clauses (172c) (cf. 4.1.2).

Like the Accusative in -gele (see 4.1.4), the Pronominal Accusative
can mark the recipient:
(173)     met tet-ul      mer-uji-t              ejre-din

          Ί Ί give you feathers for you to fly.'","[107, 108, 109, 110, 111, 112, 113]"
"2.2.3. Involvement
Another factor which can trigger internal Possessive marking is
the involvement of the Possessor in the situation being described.
For instance, in (572a) the Possessor ('his wife') participates in
the situation of arrival (which is shown by the Plural agreement
on the verb). In sentences like in (572b), the Possessor is obviously
affected by the situation:
 (572) a. tat tude         terike        soromo-p-te-ge
            CA <his wife>             person-PL-POSS-LOC
            jaqa-iji
            arrive-3PL:lNTR
            'Then they came to his wife's people.'
        b. met tudel         n'as'e-gi       cumu
            I      he        face-POSS all

            tear-CAUS-0-FUT(TR:lSG)
            Ί will tear his whole face.' [F54]
However, this factor plays a role only in a relatively small class of
instances, presumably because there is a more direct way to sig-
nify that a Possessor is involved in the situation: it can just receive
the same case marking as the Possessed (cf. 5.4.1.4, <5.4.2.1). Such
constructions can be described as instances of ""External Posses-
sion"", as attested in many other languages. The contrast between
internal Possessive marking and the External Possession construc-
tion is illustrated by the following examples: in (573a) the Posses-
sor takes the Accusative form, in (573b), it retains the unmarked
(Nominative) form:
                                           Noun phrases as noun modifiers   303(573) a. tat     num0-i)in     qon-delle       tude       terike-gele

          NEG+see(NEG:3SG)         NEG+hold(NEG:3SG)
          'He has not seen or held his bride's hand. [F3]
(see 5.4.1.4 and 5.4.2.1 for more examples of Accusative and Dative
""doubling"" under the condition of the Possessive relationship be-
tween two instances of the same case). Note that if the head noun
itself is in the Nominative case (as in (572a)-(572b)), Yukaghir
has no morphological means to distinguish between the ""External
Possessor"" which is assigned to the same case role as the Possessed
(as in (573a)) and the Possessive modifier (as in (573b)).
    Thus, Possessive marking on the head can serve a function simi-
lar to ""External Possessor"" constructions in other languages: once
it is applied, the Possessor can be conceived of as a participant
in the situation. This may but need not be reflected in the case
marking.","[320, 321]"

represented in Table 12. The class of nominal phrases conven-
tionally referred to as ""third person Anaphoric"" here comprises

a possessive pronoun, cf. Krejnovich 1982:260-261).

inative, Predicative, and Accusative cases, as well as the patient-
marking function of the Instrumental. For further discussion of

3. Accents and varieties
Given the small number of speakers nowadays, any notes about
dialectal or social varieties of Kolyma Yukaghir can only be spec-
ulative. However, the currently spoken idiolects are so distinct
as to prevent the best Yukaghir speakers from rating each other's
language competence highly; Table 5 shows that not one got the
highest rating for language competence from any expert. These
distinctions, as well as the reluctance to acknowledge each other's
competence, seem to result from two factors of language variation:
   First, the Yukaghirs currently living in Nelemnoye represent
two regional groups of Yukaghirs which used to exist before the
collectivization in 1931. One group roamed mainly along the Kor-
kodon River, the other along the Yasachnaya River. These groups
apparently spoke two distinct varieties of Kolyma Yukaghir. The
most notable phonological distinction concerned the labial vowel
harmony, which was characteristic of the Korkodon variety and is
24   Chapter 2. Kolyma   Yukaghir and its speakersstill maintained in the speech of some Kolyma Yukaghirs; one of
my consultants, A. E. Shadrina, a daughter of a Korkodon Yuk-
aghir, regularly labializes vowels in suffixes after /o/, which distin-
guishes her accent from that spoken by most of my consultants.
The same distinction was described by E. A. Krejnovich on the
basis of her father's accent (Krejnovich 1982:21-22).
    Secondly, and most importantly, the Kolyma Yukaghir language
is undergoing an extremely fast modification, so that the varieties
of the language spoken even by neighboring generations are clearly
distinct. This seems to be a part of the survival strategy cho-
sen by the language in the aggressive sociolinguistic environment.
Each generation faces a simple choice: given that their mother
tongue is not their first language, they can either reject speaking
that language and let it disappear, or simply speak as they can
(cf. Vakhtin 1992:79-80). So far, each successive age group has
chosen the second alternative. Quite predictably, the resulting
variety differs from that spoken by their parents in being more
significantly influenced by Russian. Furthermore, it can be rated
as ""corrupted"" not only by the previous generation, but by the
speakers themselves. Yet, to some extent, this strategy of ""survival
through modification"" is approved by the oldest speakers, that is,
the speakers of the ""purest"" existing variety: they themselves do
use a special simplified Yukaghir-based jargon when addressing
younger people, just in order to be understood, yet to maintain
communication in their mother tongue.
    Now, it is clear that this strategy has been applied at least
since the end of the 19th century, which means that the current
group of ""best speakers"" used to represent a ""corrupted"" version
a couple of dozens years ago. Some of them are aware of the
differences between their own language and the language their
parents used to speak (occasionally, my questions were answered
like ""I would say it this way, but my father would have said it
differently""). Even more so, they are aware of ""mistakes"" in the
language spoken by their fellow-citizens, hence low ratings of their
language competence.
                           The effect of language   contact   on Kolyma    Yukaghir       254. The effect of language contact on Kolyma Yukaghir
The most important contact languages have been Yakut and Rus-
sian. Now the contact with Russian is more significant. Russian
loanwords play an eminent role even in the Yukaghir everyday
vocabulary, e.g.:(13) Yukaghir                                   Russian
     terike           'wife, old woman'         starukha
     korobe           'cow'                     korova
     s0stok           'staff'                   shestok
     uzzuo            'gun'                     ruzhjo
Now Russian lexical items are being borrowed practically without
phonetic changes. Moreover, the borderline between the Yukaghir
lexicon and the Russian one is likely not to be ""taken into account""
in the course of natural communication: almost nobody hesitates
to insert a Russian word into a Yukaghir utterance. In contrast
with this, the words borrowed earlier (like those given in (13)) used
to be changed according to the Yukaghir phonetic rules and gen-
erally preserve their Yukaghir phonetic form in the contemporary
speech.
    The instances of occasional code-mixing are numerous, cf. the
following examples (Russian grammatical and lexical items are in
boldface):
(14) a. potomu        6to bogatyj-r/o:-t                      gude-j
         [because          rich-TRNSF-SS:lPFV                 become-iNTR:3SG

         'Because he became a rich person, that is why they used
         to go there and back (swarm around him).' [F38]

         go:lPL]
         'They began to ask him (repeatedly), let us go, let us
         go·' [F36]

          go:lMP house-DAT
          'Go home!' [F36]
None of the Russian items involved in these utterances can be
viewed as integrated into Yukaghir grammar and/or lexicon; these
examples are intended just to represent a possible source of contact
changes. Yet some grammatical items of Russian origin are used
very regularly and can be assumed to have replaced their original
Yukaghir counterparts. One of the most notable examples is the
Russian intensifier sam 'self' (in various phonetic forms):
 (15) a. sam el-ozä-nu-j
         self NEG-drink-IPFV-INTR:3SG
         'He himself didn't drink.' [K4]
       b. tude-gele kudde-m       tude-sam äj amde-j
          [he-ACC kill-TR:3SG] [he-self     CP die-lNTR:3SG]
          'He killed that one and died himself, too.' [K3]
Cf. the Yukaghir emphatic form of personal pronouns marked by
the suffix -id'ie, e.g., tude-l 'he' > tud-id'ie 'he himself'.
   In the most general terms, the effect of Russian contact on
Kolyma Yukaghir grammar can be described as a shift from origi-
nal Yukaghir synthetic grammatical patterns to newly introduced
analytical patterns. In some cases, the new pattern involves a
grammatical item borrowed from Russian. For example, obliga-
tive modality is now expressed almost exclusively by a construc-
tion with a Russian predicative loanword nado 'is-necessary' and a
nominalized form of a verb (as in (16a)), which is rapidly replacing
Yukaghir modal suffixes (the old pattern is illustrated by (16b)),
e.g.:
 (16) a. tamun min-gi          nado
         that     take-POSS necessary
         'It is necessary to take it.'
       b. tamun      min-mozi
          that     take-PRSP(TR:lSG)
          'It is necessary/inevitable to take it, I should take it.'
                                            Kolyma   and Tundra Yukaghir   27Another subclass of these contact phenomena comprises various
expansions of Russian-like grammatical patterns construed by
means of Yukaghir morphology, which squeeze out Yukaghir syn-
thetic patterns and take over their functions. For example, Yuk-
aghir has a verbal suffix -ji- designating movement in order to
perform the action denoted by the stem. This suffix can occur
either in a finite verb form as in (17a), or in a same-subject form
dominated by a verb of movement as in (17b). Both patterns are
being rapidly replaced by a construction with the Supine, similar
to t h a t found in many European languages (including Russian),
e.g. (17c):
(17) a. tabud-ek     ju0-ji-mele
        this-PRED look-PURP-OF:3SG
        'He went to look at this.'
      b. ays 'i-ji-t               kewe-s'
         [search-PURP-SS:IPFV] go-PFV:INTR:3SG
         'He went to look for it.'
      c. arjs'i-din   kewe-s'
         search-SUP go-3SG:INTR
         'He went to look for it.'
Although the construction with the Supine is hardly new for
Kolyma Yukaghir, it can be assumed to have been a marginal
device for expressing this situation type until recently. Now, it is
the most common and frequently applied option, while the pat-
terns represented in (17a)-(17b), having no structural parallel in
Russian, are squeezed out.
   Similar phenomena are found in almost all fragments of Yuk-
aghir grammar and will therefore be described in detail in the
respective sections of the book. In general, I will try to present
modern Kolyma Yukaghir as it is used in everyday communication
(that is, by Yukaghirs over 55-60).","[41, 42, 43, 44, 45]"

2.3.3. Relativization and complementation
Relative clauses are built by means of the Attributive verb forms,
the Action Nominal, and, far less frequently, by the Result Nomi-
nal. The syntactic roles accessible for relativization are the subject
(11a), the direct object ( l i b ) , the spatial or temporal adverbial
(11c), and the Possessor of the intransitive subject ( l i d ) .
(11) a. purk-in      soromo le-je        soromo
        [seven-ATTR person eat-ATTR] person
        'a person who has eaten seven people'
12   Chapter 1.   Introduction       b. tit      ide-met                   anil
           [you catch-ATTR:2PL]              fish
           'the fish that you have caught' [T2]
       c. odu-pe                 modo-l         jalhil-pe-gi
           [Yukaghir-PL live-ANR] lake-PL-POSS
           'the lake where the Yukaghirs lived' [K3]
       d. noj-de                   citne-j          nodo-k
           [leg-POSS:ATTR long-ATTR] bird-PRED
           'a bird whose legs are long'
The main complementation strategy makes use of the Nominal
verb forms, Action Nominal and Result Nominal:
 (12) a. omo-s'                    tet    qamie-d'e-l          met-in
           good-INTR:3SG [you help-DETR-ANR I-DAT]

           Ί did not tell anybody that I had seen such a

3. A b o u t this grammar
 3.1. Purpose
The history of Yukaghir studies features the names of two bril-
liant researchers, Woldemar Jochelson and Eruhim Krejnovich,
who have provided the basic grammatical descriptions of the Yuk-
aghir languages (Jochelson 1898; 1900; 1905; Krejnovich 1955;
1958; 1968; 1979; 1982). The Kolyma Yukaghir language has been
briefly described by Jochelson (1905) and Krejnovich (1979); the
former source (which is apparently best known to the English-
reading audience) is based on the rich data collected by Jochelson
at the end of the XIX th century (1898; 1900). Krejnovich's es-
say in Encyclopedia of the languages of Asia and Africa (1979)
is based both on Jochelson's materials and on Krejnovich's own
                                                About this grammar   13data collected in 1959. Finally, Krejnovich's last work (1982) rep-
resents the most detailed and comprehensive source of information
on a range of significant issues for both Yukaghir languages. These
works constitute the major sources of first-hand data on Kolyma
Yukaghir,1 which have served as the basis for a number of papers
dealing with some specific topics, as well as for typological studies
involving Yukaghir data. A detailed description of Kolyma Yuk-
aghir phonology based on new field data constitutes a part of Irina
Nikolaeva's unpublished Ph.D. thesis (1988b).
   Thus, there is no book which might serve as a reference gram-
mar of Kolyma Yukaghir. Further, some important aspects of the
language have not been described at all. This grammar is intended
to fill that gap, drawing both on the previous descriptions of Yuk-
aghir and on the results of my own field work, and thus to make
Kolyma Yukaghir data available for further studies, as well as for
cross-linguistic research.2
   The grammar attempts to cover all attested forms and con-
structions of contemporary Kolyma Yukaghir; in this restricted
sense, it is intended to be comprehensive. It is clear, however,
that no single book can provide a truly ""comprehensive"" descrip-
tion of any human language, at least not at the present stage of
development of linguistics. Writing a grammar inevitably involves
making a number of choices, so that some aspects of the language
structure may be described and exemplified in more detail, others
only briefly sketched, and possibly some may be omitted from the
description. Insofar as such decisions have been made consciously,
I have attempted to write this grammar in such a way as to ""let
the language speak"", rather than to force it to answer any par-
ticular theoretically pre-determined questions. In other words, I
have tried to concentrate on those constructions and grammatical
distinctions that appear to be of importance in Yukaghir gram-
mar and discourse, rather than on those that play a major role in
current linguistic theories.
14   Chapter 1.   Introduction 3.2. The structure of the grammar
This grammar has a rather traditional structure: it comprises a
sociolinguistic introduction (Chapter 2), Phonology (Chapter 3),
Morphology (Chapters 4-7), Syntax (Chapters 8-14), and Texts
(Appendix 3). The lexicon is represented by two Appendices: a
Yukaghir-English vocabulary (Appendix 1) and an exemplified list
of nonproductive verbal derivational suffixes (Appendix 2). The
Morphology is divided into chapters according to the classification
into parts of speech, which is introduced in Chapter 4. The further
structuring of each chapter is essentially determined by two kinds
of considerations, which can be called paradigmatic and semantic:
    Whenever some morphological items clearly constitute a para-
digm, they are treated as such. Normally, I start a description of a
paradigm with a listing of opposed items and their form(s), which
is followed by a semantic (functional) description of each particular
item. If it appears that some morpheme can be more appropri-
ately described separately, not as a member of any paradigmatic
opposition (this is the case for some derivational morphemes), its
form and meaning are treated together. In both cases, I take the
form-to-function approach, that is, I describe the meaning(s) (or
function(s)) of grammatical items singled out on formal grounds.
These considerations determine the ""micro-structure"" of the mor-
phological description.
    On the other hand, the ""macro-structure"" of each chapter fol-
lows the function-to-form approach, that is, it features such gen-
eral semantic categories as, e.g., ""Aspect"" or ""Demonstrative pro-
noun"", under which various paradigms or separate morphological
items are subsumed on functional grounds. In practice, this means
that considerations of semantic affinity prevail over distinctions in
the grammatical status, in particular, over the opposition between
inflection and derivation. For instance, the section on Aspect deals
with all morphological means employed for expressing aspectual
meanings, regardless of their regularity, productivity, and the like.
This is not to say, of course, that such properties are not expli-
cated for each item. Normally, each section starts with a general
overview of the morphological means it describes, their (formal
                                                About this grammar   15and semantic) relations to each other, grammatical status, etc.
    The Syntax is structured according to similar considerations.
It is divided into seven chapters associated with more or less tra-
ditional topics in syntax, as determined by general classification
of syntactic units and types of syntactic relations. The internal
structure of each chapter is determined by grammatical distinc-
tions expressed in Yukaghir, that is, the constructions are classi-
fied according to functional considerations, which helps to high-
light the contrasting features of functionally similar constructions.
On the micro-level, the description of each construction takes the
form-to-function approach: my aim is to describe and exemplify
various constructions and the meaning(s) associated with these
constructions.
    I believe that this combination of the form-to-function approach
to the description proper and the function-to-form approach to
classification of items into chapters and sections of a grammar
appropriately suits the objectives of this endeavor: on the one
hand, it provides a reasonable degree of accessibility of informa-
tion on the basis of rather general and semantically motivated
headings determined by the more or less widely assumed view
on what a descriptive grammar should cover; on the other hand,
on the micro-level it licenses a description of grammatical items
and associated semantic configurations, as they are attested in the
specific language, rather than mapping of linguistic constructs and
concepts onto that language.
    To be sure, at a number of points these approaches turn out to
be in contradiction, i.e., the range of functions associated with a
morphological item or syntactic construction crosses the ""bound-
aries"" set by the general semantic considerations. There is no one
way to solve the descriptive problems produced by such contra-
dictions that can be applied throughout the grammar. However,
there are two technical devices which are intended to override
these contradictions: cross-references between the relevant frag-
ments of the grammar and special sections providing summaries
of interrelated phenomena treated in different parts of the gram-
mar (e.g., there is a summary of properties which identify the
16   Chapter 1.   Introductionsyntactic function of subject in Yukaghir; since these properties
manifest themselves in various types of syntactic constructions,
they are described in detail in different sections of the grammar).
To sum up, the macro-structure of the description offered here
is determined by how I understand what descriptive linguistics
is about; in many respects, it follows such general guidelines for
descriptive linguists as Lingua Descriptive Questionnaire (Comrie
and Smith 1977) and Language Typology and Syntactic Descrip-
tion (Shopen 1985). The micro-structure is determined by what I
know of Kolyma Yukaghir and represents an attempt to describe
the language ""in its own terms"".","[29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34]"
"1.1.1. The case paradigm
Personal pronouns are inflected for case according to the general
rules of nominal inflection, with only some minor differences:
  1. The Instrumental case is not attested. 34
  2. The first and second person pronouns have the Pronominal
     Accusative form (see 5.4.1.5, 0.1.1). The Nominative form of
     the third person pronouns has the same formal marking (-/)
     as the Pronominal Accusative.
  3. For the third person pronouns, the Nominative and the Pos-
     sessive forms are formally distinguished, while the first and
     second person pronouns are used as the Possessive modifiers
     in their Nominative form, i.e., like nouns (5.4.1.2, 8.2.1); see
     1.1.2.",[251]
"2.2.1. Nouns
Nouns are inflected for number (Singular, Plural), case (Nomina-
tive, Predicative, Accusative, Instrumental, Dative, Locative, Ab-
lative, Prolative, and Comitative), and Possession (cross-reference
suffixes for third Person Possessor only). This paradigm is exem-
plified in Table 2 for the noun ace 'domestic deer'.
    The Possessive marker cross-references either the possessive
modifier or a possessor outside the NP. It can be used only for
a third person Possessor t h a t is not coreferential with the subject

is used to express the possessive relationship.
    When combined with the Possessive cross-reference marker, the
Plural may denote the number of the Possessed, the Possessor, or
both, so that a form like äce-p-ki   (deer-PL-3(NOM)) is ambiguous
among 'his/her deer (many)', 'their deer (one)' and 'their deer
(many)'.
    Nouns have an Attributive form in -d/-n which can be used
only non-referentially (e.g., äce-n legul 'deer-food, food for deer')
and two ""verbal"" forms, the Proprietive form, which is built by
means of the suffix -n'e- ~ -n'- (äce-n'-     'to have (a) deer, to be
with deer'), and the Stative form derived by the bound variant
+i)ö-  of the copulative verb δ- 'to be' ( ä c e + η δ - 'be (a) deer').
    Nouns also have a Transformative form which is derived from
the Stative form by means of the suffix -n/-t, e.g., äc.e+i)5-n           'as
a deer, (become) a deer', a Privative form built by the combina-
tion of the standard negative prefix el- and the postfix              +cu0n,
e.g., el+ace+cu0n     'without (a) deer', and an (almost obsolete)
Prospective form, e.g., pulut+mozu        'fiance' (from pulut        'hus-
band').
    There is a number of nominal derivational suffixes, only two
of which are productive, the Diminutive, -die-, e.g., äce-die           'lit-
tle deer' and the Augmentative, -tege- ~ -the-, e.g., äce-tke        'large
deer'; these suffixes follow the Possessive markers within a word
form. Nouns can also be built by compounding and by lexicaliza-

4.1.6. The Instrumental case: patient-marking function
The Instrumental case can be used for the Ο participant if A
is third person (i.e., under the same condition as the Accusative
marking, see 4.1.4). This marking is incompatible with definite
pronouns, Possessive noun phrases and proper nouns (in these
cases, only the Accusative marking is available).
(174) a. n'umud'i-le   mid'-u-m

         'He took an ax.' [F14]

96   Chapter   5. Nominal    morphologyIn most cases, the Instrumental Ο marking is applied to unmod-
ified nouns, 21 since the presence of a modifier either attracts the
Focus marking (see 4.1.3), or implies definiteness and licenses the
Accusative marking thereby (see 4.1.4). This is rather a tendency
than a rule, since in a few examples the Instrumental marking is
applied to definite (175a) and/or modified noun phrases (175b).

Like the Accusative (see (170)), the Instrumental case can mark
the whole if some part of it constitutes the Ο participant of the
clause:

In particular, the meaning of purpose is characteristic of the Action
Nominal Dative:

See £.1.3.3, 11.4.4 for functions of the ""frozen"" Action Nominal
Possessive Dative (Supine).
   The Dative marking can be doubled,whereby the second Da-
tive (normally, the Possessive Dative form) is used to specify the
direction more precisely. The following examples illustrate this
phenomenon for a body part (184a) and for the Possessive form
of the AD-postposition al' (see 7.3.1.1.1):

                'The hare and the old man worked the whole day from

In one example, the Dative is used temporally in the combination
with the Russian preposition do 'until':

                'They waited until the morning.' [F36]
The Dative constitutes an element of some verb patterns (9.2.4,
9.2.6) and is used within the Body-Part form (see 4.2.2); see also
5.1.1 for its marginal use as a noun modifier.","[113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118]"
" Terminological note. In the syntactic chapters of this book,
    the term ""Predicative marking"" is applied to cases like (605)
    as well, that is, I will not make the reservations concern-
    ing Anaphoric NPs at all points where Focus marking is
    mentioned. Similar terminological conventions are applied
    to other case marking options: the term ""Neutral marking""
    refers to the second marking option in the list above (Nomina-
    tive for third-person NPs, Pronominal Accusative for first and
    second person pronouns). Thus, Neutral marking is opposed
    to Nominative marking, where the Nominative case is used
    independently of the person. The term ""Accusative marking""
    is applied to refer to the third marking option, independently
    of the particular case employed.521.1.2. Intransitive finite clauses: split intransitivity
The single core participant of a finite intransitive clause (S) can
either take the Nominative form or be marked as the grammatical
Focus of the clause. The latter option involves the Predicative
marking of the NP (5.4.1.3) and the choice of the SFparadigm for
the finite verb (6.1.1.2). These options are exemplified in 5.4.1.2
and 5.4.1.3. Thus, Yukaghir appears to show a special (""Focus-
oriented"") case of split intransitivity:53 the S participant takes ei-
ther Nominative marking (associated with the A participant in a
328     Chapter   9. Syntax   of the   clausetransitive clause) or Predicative marking (associated with the Ο
participant in a transitive clause).
    These marking properties naturally give rise to the following
question: Which grammatical units (if any) can be associated with
syntactic functions (or grammatical relations), such as subject,
direct object, etc.; in other words, do the participant roles identify
the syntactic functions, or are these functions identifiable only for
a given packaging variant? To put the question straightforwardly,
is it only the Nominative (non-Focus) primary participant (A/S)
that can be identified as the subject of a clause, or is subjecthood
maintained for the Predicative (Focus) S as well?54
    The former analysis might appear more plausible not only on
morphological grounds, but also on the basis of functional con-
siderations, inasmuch as some sort of topichood is generally asso-
ciated with subjects. It appears, however, that Yukaghir gram-
mar assigns the subject properties to the primary participant role
(A/S), be it the Focus or not, rather than to the Nominative (non-
Focus) A/S. That is to say, the syntactic generalizations of the
type cross-linguistically associated with ""subjects"" are to be stated
over the participant roles, without regard for the Focus marking.
Various syntactic constructions that substantiate this claim are de-
scribed in different parts of this grammar; see 1.4 for a summary
of this evidence.","[345, 346]"
"1. Core participants and grammatical relations
 1.1. Finite clauses: summary of case marking
1.1.1. Transitive finite clauses
The primary participant of the transitive finite clause (A) takes
the Nominative form 50 and controls the agreement marking on the
verb (see 5.4.1.2, £.1.1.2); it is easily dropped when recoverable.
The secondary participant (O) lacks a uniform case marking; the
following options are available:  1. Predicative marking. The Ο participant can be marked as
     the Focus, which entails the choice of the OF paradigm for
326   Chapter 9. Syntax of the clause      the finite verb (see 5.4.1.3, £.1.1.2). The Focus NP cannot be
      dropped. The Focus marking ensures the distinguishability of
      the participants, insofar as no other participant of a transitive
      clause can be marked as the Focus (see 12.2-12.3).
  2. Neutral marking. Provided that A is first or second person,
     a third person Ο takes the Nominative form (5.4.1.2), a first
     or second person O, the Pronominal Accusative form (5.4.1.5,
     7.1.1.1). Both in this and in the next case the Ο participant
     can be easily dropped if the referent is recoverable from the
     context.
  3. Accusative marking. If A is third person, a non-Focus Ο
     participant takes the Accusative or the Instrumental form
     (5.4.1.4, 5.4.1.6).
These marking options are exemplified in the respective sections
on case functions (5.4.1), as well as by many other examples in
this book; for a description of Focus marking, see 12.2-12.3.
   Note that the so called ""Anaphoric NPs"" (proper nouns, third-
person personal pronouns, and Possessive NPs) do not take the
Predicative case form (5.4.1.1, 5.4.1.2). Instead, the Nominative
form is used in all positions where the Predicative case would
otherwise be required. As a result, in sentences like (605) both
core participants are in the Nominative case form. 51

However, such sentences are never ambiguous, since they occur
only if the Ο participant is marked as the Focus and the Focus NP
always takes the preverbal position. Hence, the NP representing
the A participant cannot intervene between the Focus and the
finite verb (see 1.5.1). In addition, the Focus NP (which is implied
by the verb form) cannot be omitted, so that the Nominative NP in
the preverbal position can only be interpreted as the Ο participant.
Thus, it is the grammatical Focus marking (as manifested in the
linearization rules, constraints on pro-drop, and the OF form of
the verb) that is employed to distinguish the core participants in
such clauses.","[343, 344, 345]"
"It might therefore be suggested that the Focus construction should
be analyzed as a combination of a clause-external constituent and
a free relative clause. Furthermore, there are two types of con-
structions which apparently favor the clause-external analysis of
the grammatical Focus (2.3-2.4).
   This combination of properties indicates that the Focus con-
struction is a result of grammaticalization of a cleft-like structure,
a typologically quite frequent source for Focus constructions.
452     Chapter 12. Nominal predicates and grammatical   Focus 2.2. Focus as a clause-internal phenomenon: summary
The grammatical Focus in Yukaghir exhibits a number of syntactic
features which identify it as a clause-internal phenomenon:
      • The word order in the Focus construction not only maintains
        the regularities attested in other clause types, but even ad-
        heres to them more strictly, that is to say, the Focus NP is not
        split off from the remainder of the clause. In particular, the
        A constituent cannot intervene between the Focus and the
        verb form (see P. 1.5.1). This linearization rule can be viewed
        as grammaticalization of the information-packaging function
        of Focus marking, which implies that the presupposed mate-
        rial (in particular, the topic) should precede the Focus (see
        Section 3). On the other hand, it is in obvious contradic-
        tion with a cleft-like analysis, which would suggest that the
        A constituent belongs to a free relative clause.
      • The accessibility constraints on Focus marking are much
        stronger than those on relativization; in particular, the A
        constituent is accessible for relativization (Ü.3.1.1), but not
        for the Focus marking (P. 1.1.1). The Focus marking is orga-
        nized in such a way as to ensure the unique identification of
        the clause-internal role of the NP: it can be applied only to
        one participant role per clause type.
      • The Focus S constituent maintains the syntactic properties
        associated with the subjects (0.1.4.1, 2.4).
      • The SF and OF forms of the verb, in contrast with the simi-
        lar forms used for relativization, have the full range of finite
        morphology (see 0.1.2.1, 0.1.3.2).
These properties suggest that the Focus in Yukaghir is grammati-
calized as a clause-internal phenomenon: the strong syntactic con-
straints on Focus marking are not motivated by the constraints on
relativization, nor by the Focus semantics per se. Rather, they
are targeted at integrating the Focus into the clause-internal syn-
tax, so that the Focus marking unambiguously assigns the NP to
a clause-internal function (participant role).
                                     Syntax of the Focus construction   453 2.3. Cleft-like constructions
The Focus construction may contain, although rather infrequently,
a demonstrative pronoun in the Nominative form which is not as-
signed to any clause-internal function and can be analyzed only
as the subject associated with the Predicative NP according to
the descriptive pattern (1.1.1). Consequently, the remainder of
the construction should be analyzed as a free relative clause. The
sentence in (790a) illustrates the OF construction with a demon-
strative pronoun, (790b), the SF construction.
(790) a. ju0-k              adu0n   tet-ek         ar/ci-rjile
          see-iMP:2SG | this        you-PRED search-3PL:OF
          'Look, it is you that they are looking for.' [K5]
        b. adu0n   aleksej-die   cwjze-l
          this     A.-DIM        whistle-SF
          'It is Aleksej that is whistling.'
It should be stressed that the demonstrative pronoun in such a
construction is not a ""dummy subject"", i.e., it always refers to
some actual phenomenon in the situation of speech. In (790),
the demonstrative refers to a situation taking place at the time
of speech (calling somebody in (790a), whistling in (790b)). In
(791), the demonstrative has an entity referent (a dog found by
the speaker and his mother).
(791)     emie,    tu0n soromo-lek        touke+r/ot
          mother that person-PRED [dog-TRNSF
          kude-delle       ejrie-l'el-u-l
          become-SS:PFV]     come-iNFR-0-SF
          'Mother, this one has turned out to be a human being
          which has transformed into a dog.' [F20]
However, other types of NPs are impossible in this position (e.g.,
in (791), the demonstrative pronoun cannot be replaced by an NP
like 'that dog').
    The construction observes all constraints on the Focus con-
struction outlined in 2.2: Predicative marking can be applied only
to the S/O participant; the A constituent cannot take the linear
454   Chapter 12. Nominal predicates and grammatical   Focusposition between the Focus and the verb form, i.e., it is either
postposed (792a) or precedes the Focus (thus taking the posi-
tion between the demonstrative pronoun and the Predicative NP,
(792b)).
 (792) a. tu0n lem-dik               üj-met               tit?
            that    what-PRED make-OF:2PL                you
            'What is it that you are doing?'
        b. adu0n tet         cicetke-lek      ju0-l'el-me
            this      you C-PRED              see-INFR-OF:2SG
            'It is Chechetka that you have seen.'
However, this construction gives a piece of syntactic evidence in fa-
vor of the clause-external origin of the grammatical Focus, insofar
as the demonstrative pronouns manifest the presence of the sub-
ject slot (which can be attributed to the main clause with nominal
predicate, but cannot be accounted for under the clause-internal
analysis of the Focus).
   On the other hand, this construction could have become possi-
ble under the influence of Russian, where the demonstrative pro-
noun eto 'it, this' is regularly used to highlight the focus; in partic-
ular, this pronoun appears in the Russian translations of the sen-
tences like (791)-(792) provided by the Yukaghir narrators. Thus,
such sentences appear to combine the Yukaghir and the Russian
tools for focus marking. Notably, such examples have not been
attested in previous descriptions of the Yukaghir Focus (which are
based on earlier data), which can be taken as a piece of indirect
evidence in favor of this hypothesis.","[469, 470, 471, 472]"
" 1.2. Non-finite clauses
The case marking of the core participants in non-finite clause dif-
fers from that outlined above for finite clauses:      • Focus marking is impossible in non-finite clauses.
      • The primary participants of Nominal and Attributive relative
        clauses are encoded as Possessive modifiers (see 1.2.1).
      • Neutral Ο marking in non-finite clause is compatible with the
        third person A participant, under pragmatic conditions which
        can be formulated in terms of oppositions between global and
        local participants (1.2.2).
                              Core participants   and grammatical   relations   329I.2.1. Possessive A/S marking
The primary (A/S) participant of a Nominal clause (see 11.1 and
II.3.2) or an Attributive relative clause (11.3.1) is encoded as the
Possessive modifier of the head NP, that is, of the Nominal verb
form or the relativized NP respectively.55 Since non-pronominal
Possessive modifiers always take the Nominative (unmarked) form
(see 5.2.1.1, 8.2.2), the case form of a noun cannot reflect this
property. Therefore, Possessive A/S marking is manifested only
by the following features:
  • Third-person pronouns take the possessive (unmarked) form
    and are used reflexively, i.e., according to the general rule
    for Possessive modifiers of NPs (7.1.1.2), see examples (606a)
    and (607a).
  • The A/S participant (different from that of the matrix clause)
    can be cross-referenced on the head NP by the Possessive
    marker. The sentences in (606b), (607b) illustrate pronom-
    inal Possessive marking, and the sentences in (606c), (607c)
    illustrate internal Possessive marking (see <9.2.2.1 for a de-
    scription of this distinction).
  • The Plural marker on the head may indicate either the plural-
    ity of the relativized NP (607b) 56 or the plurality of the S/A-
    participant of the Nominal (606c) or relative clause (607c),
    or both; see 5.3.2.3.

                             Core participants   and grammatical   relations   3311.2.2. Differential Ο marking: global vs. local participants
In contrast to the finite clause (see 1.1.1), Neutral Ο marking in
non-finite clauses is compatible with a third person A participant.
Thus, the variability between Neutral and Accusative Ο marking
is not fully accounted for in terms of the person of A. Differential
Ο marking appears to correlate with the relative prominence of
the core participants outside the given clause, i.e., in some higher-
level text unit. More specifically, Neutral marking is available if
the A participant is conceived of as a salient element of a more
global text unit than the Ο participant, according to the following
tentative hierarchy: clause < episode < text.5,7
1.2.2.1. Variability of O-marking. Exactly as in finite clauses,
Neutral Ο marking is the only option when A is first or second
person:
(608) a. tintarj   ääl    mibe-de-gen              cine-delle
           [that   tree   root-POSS-PROL          chop-SS:PFV]

          'When I close my eyes in the darkness, I can see.' [F31]
Differential Ο marking in clauses with third person A is illustrated
by the pairs of examples in (609)-(612) for various types of non-
finite clauses. In each pair of examples, the sentence in (a) illus-
trates the Accusative option, and the sentence in (b) illustrates the
Neutral option. These examples are intended to demonstrate that
there is no strict syntactic rule which governs the choice of one or
another option; see the examples in (611), where there seems to
be just no semantic or structural difference between the (a) and
(b)-sentences which could account for the differing Ο marking.
Neither can the differential Ο marking be explained in terms of
semantic or pragmatic properties of the NP (as attested in some
332   Chapter   9. Syntax   of the   clauseother languages). In particular, Neutral marking may occur with
highly ""individuated"" and referential NPs; see (611b), (613c). 58
Differential Ο marking in Relative clauses:

clause represents the unique occurrence of some entity in the cur-
rent episode of the text, it usually takes Neutral marking:
(613) a. irk-in           ar/d'e-n'-u-l-ben                       SeSpedaijiV

           'Look for the shaman who has eaten my girl! ' [F44]
See also (609b), (610b).
    An essential point is that a local Ο participant may be pre-
viously mentioned in other episodes of the text; what matters
is its status within the current episode. For instance, the sen-
tence in (613c) starts an episode describing a struggle between
two shamans (one who has eaten the girl and the other to whom
the request in (613c) is addressed), an episode in which the girl
herself does not play any role (although she is the main figure of
one of the previous episodes). In (614b) the Ο participant has a
pronominal modifier tintaij 'that, aforementioned' which indicates
that the participant plays a role in a previous episode; however,
it is its single occurrence within the current episode, hence the
Neutral marking.
    In all instances of the local Ο participant, the A participant
represents a continuous and/or persistent entity, that is, it does
occur in other clauses of the same episode, either within (as in
(613)) or outside (as in (614)) the given sentence. For instance,
in (614a) the A participant is not shared by the finite clause,
but nonetheless represents a prominent participant in the episode.
Similarly, the sentence in (614b) belongs to a piece of text which
describes a series of actions carried out by the A participant of
the non-finite clause, each involving another set of non-primary
participants. Hence, the core participants have differing statuses
within the episode, although the difference is not observable on
the sentence level.

           '(He) jabbed that woman with a splinter, and the

clauses of the same episode, 59 both marking options are available.
For Neutral Ο marking to be possible, the A participant must
represent a more prominent and persistent figure of the episode or
of the text as a whole.
   For instance, in each sentence in (615) the Ο participant of the
non-finite clause is shared by the finite clause, but it is a relatively
minor element on the episode level, while the A participant is the
central figure of the episode. Apparently similar examples in (616)
instantiate another type of situation where both participants play
significant roles in the episode. For instance, the bag in (616a) is
a magic thing involved in all the events of the episode, while the
knife in (615a) is nothing more than an instrument employed only
within this particular event. 60

            him away. ' [Fl5]
In (617), the Ο participant is involved in the relative clause only,
but it is a continuous and persistent entity within the episode, as
well as the main hero of the text (see Text 1). The A participant
plays a role both in the relative clause situation and in the main
clause situation, yet it is a less prominent figure of the episode
and does not persist in other episodes of the text. This situation
triggers Accusative marking.

            'The fishes that had brought him said to the sea king:
            [...]' [Tl]
Note that Neutral Ο marking does not require the A participant
to be shared by other clauses of the sentence. For instance, in
(612b) the Ο participant occurs in both clauses of the chain, the
A participant being involved in the non-finite clause only. Fur-
thermore, the Ο participant is a salient element of the episode (in
which the hero has to follow the way indicated by the hatchet);
yet the A participant is more ""global"", being the main figure both
of the episode and of the text, hence the Neutral marking.
    This evidence seems to indicate that Neutral Ο marking in the
non-finite clause is available only if the A participant of that clause
is a more ""global"" entity, either on the episode level (see 1.2.2.2)
or on the text level. If the Ο participant is a more (or equally)
prominent entity both on the episode and on the text levels, it is
likely to take the Accusative marking.
                            Core participants   and grammatical   relations   337 1.3. ""Pragmatic motivations"" for case marking: summary
There are four alternative mechanisms which are employed to dis-
tinguish the core participants of a transitive clause:
  1. Focus marking. If the Ο participant is marked for the gram-
     matical Focus, the core participants of the clause are distin-
     guished by virtue of the fact that the A participant cannot
     take the Predicative marking (1.1.1). This mechanism can
     be viewed as a sort of grammaticalization of the semantic
     affinity between the A role and the ""topic"", on the one hand,
     and the Ο role and the ""focus,"" on the other. Various re-
     flexes of these affinities are attested in the grammars of many
     languages. What may distinguish Yukaghir typologically is
     the especially prominent role of this association in the core
     clause-internal syntax.
  2. Person hierarchy. If the A participant coincides with a speech
     act participant and the Ο participant does not, no overt case
     marking is needed, i.e., the grammar associates the partici-
     pants of the speech act with the A role and the third person
     with the Ο role. Such affinities are also clearly semantically
     motivated and widely attested cross-linguistically. In addi-
     tion, the agreement marking on the ν erb gives a strong formal
     support to this mechanism: the combination of a Nominative
     NP and a first- or second-person verb form accepts only the
     Ο interpretation of that NP.","[346, 347, 348, 349, 350, 351, 352, 353, 354, 355]"
"1.2. Word order in the noun phrase
Noun phrases are head-final (see Sections 2-3); the order of noun
modifiers conforms, with few exceptions, to the following scheme:
( 5 4 7 ) DEMONSTRATIVE + QUANTIFIER + POSSESSIVE PRONOUN
          + ATTRIBUTE + HEADwhere ""attribute"" stands for any lexical modifier, be it an NP or a
relative clause. This scheme is illustrated by the following exam-
ples:
                                    The structure   of the noun phrase   287Demonstrative + Quantifier:

         'those pants of his'
        b. taij met jaqa-d+äs'e

           'one of my nets'

         one-ATTR orphan+STAT-ATTR woman child
         'one orphan girl'

          'his wooden spoon'
        b. met kenme pajpä-die
           my friend woman-DlM
           'my friend (a girl)'
Attributive Indefinite pronouns combine only with attributes; they
are always phrase-initial:
 (554) a.      tie 0nme-n'-d'e      soromo-pul
             some [mind-PRPR-ATTR] person-PL
             'some clever people'
        b.     tie n'e+legu-l          en-d'on-pe
             some [RECP+eat-O-ANR] animal-PL
             'some animals who ate each other.'
In contradiction to the general scheme in (547), contrastive at-
tributes may precede determiners and possessive pronouns. Such
cases are attested with attributes which single out one of several
people who have the same kinship relationship to somebody:
 (555) a. 0rd'5-l       tude masl'u0
          [middle-ANR] her daughter
          'her middle daughter'
        b. comö-l      tar) päbä-gi
           [big-ANR] that elder.sister-POSS
           'the oldest of those elder sisters of hers.'
Since the NP may contain more than one noun, its internal struc-
ture may turn out ambiguous, as shown in (556) : 3 9(556) MODIFIER <MODIFIER HEAD> hea
       <MODIFIER H E A D > M O D I P I E R HEAD
                                    Noun phrases as noun modifiers   289These options are illustrated in (557). Note that the NP-initial
demonstrative modifier is related to the NP as a whole in (557a),
but to the nominal modifier in (557b).
(557) a. tir) cu0l'e-d+omm                  n'ied'i-l

         cthat <be.rich-ATTR old.man>> house
         'the house of that rich old man'
This structural ambiguity can be resolved by means of Possessive
marking (2.2.4) or Attributive marking (2.3.1).","[304, 305, 306, 307]"

  4. The personal pronouns have two special forms, absent from
     the nominal paradigm:
        • Free Possessive form ('mine', 'yours', etc.); see 1.1.3
        • Intensified form ('self'); see 1.1.4.
  5. The third person pronouns belong to the class of Anaphoric
     noun phrases, i.e., they do not attach the Predicative marker
     and take the Nominative form in the predicative function and
     and in the Focus position (see 5.4.1.1, 5.3.1.2).
Table 18 gives illustrative paradigms for the LSG, 2PL, and 3SG
pronouns. The inflection of the other three pronouns is completely
analogous.","[251, 252]"
"1.4.2. Direct object properties (O participant)
The direct object (O participant) can be distinguished from other
objects by the following properties:      • The Ο participant can receive the grammatical Focus (Pred-
        icative) marking, which is impossible for other objects.
      • The Ο participant can take the Nominative case form (under
        the conditions described in 1.1.1, 1.2.2).
      • The Ο participant can be promoted to the S position by
        means of the Resultative (5.3.5.6.2).
      • The coreference of the Ο participant with the A participant
        is marked by the Reflexive marking on the verb (see 5.4.5.3,
           1.1.1).
      • The Ο participant can be relativized (see 11.3 for details).
      • The Ο participant can control scalar quantifier floating (see
        5.3).
                            Core participants   and grammatical   relations   3411.4.3. Indirect object properties (Dative participant)
The following properties are shared by the Ο participant and the
Dative participant of a ditransitive clause (see 2.4.2), in contrast
to more marginal constituents:  • The Ο participant and the Dative participant of a ditransitive
    clause can take the Accusative case form (both the regular
    Accusative and the pronominal Accusative, see 2.4).
  • The reciprocal relation between the primary participant, on
    the one hand, and the Ο participant or the Dative partici-
    pant, on the other, can be marked by means of the Reciprocal
    marking on the verb alone (6.4.5.2), while for more marginal
    participants a free postposition-based reciprocal marker (see
    3.2.2) is needed.
  • The Ο participant and the Dative participant can control the
    omitted primary participant in the Supine Purpose clause
    (11.4.4).61
 1.5. Constituent order
1.5.1. Basic word order
The most frequent word order in terms of the core constituents is
subject-object-verb, which is illustrated by most of the examples
in this grammar. However, the word order, in particular in finite
clauses, is rather flexible and is more appropriately described by
the following ""discourse-oriented"" scheme:(619) Topic-Focus-verb-(After-Topic)Since the Focus is grammaticalized, this scheme imposes two strict
constraints on the word order variation: the Focus cannot follow
the verb (see 14-2.2.3), and the A constituent cannot intervene
between the Ο Focus and the finite verb. As shown in 1.1.1, the
latter rule can play a major role in distinguishing the participants
of a clause.
342   Chapter   9. Syntax   of the   clause   There are two types of deviations from the SOV order: right
dislocation (1.5.2) and clause-initial objects (1.5.3). NP disconti-
nuity is possible but rather infrequent (1.5.4).","[358, 359, 360]"
"2.2.1. Referential autonomy2.2.1.1. Pronominal Possessive marking. The Possessive marker
on a noun cross-references the Possessor (5.2). The Possessive
markers can be used pronominally, that is, they can replace nom-
inal possessive modifiers. In such cases the entity cross-referenced
by the Possessive marking is represented either by another (non-
subject) element of the same clause or by an element of a preceding
clause. This use is illustrated by the following examples:

other class of instances of the Possessive marking, where the Pos-
sessor is represented by a nominal modifier within the same NP
(below, internal Possessive marking). In this construction, the
Possessor is represented by an NP in the Nominative form which
immediately precedes the NP bearing the Possessive marker:

298   Chapter 8. Noun phrase and postpositional   phraseThe examples in (558)-(560) and (568) demonstrate that the Pos-
sessive relationship between two entities licenses both the zero
marking and the internal Possessive marking (see 5.2 for more ex-
amples of the latter option). In other words, if the NP is intended
to invoke two referential entities (i.e., the modifier referent and
the head referent), the speaker is free to choose between these en-
coding options. The semantic distinction between these options
can be explicated in terms of markedness: the impact of the Pos-
sessive marking is to signify that the modifier has a referent of
its own, while the zero option leaves this feature unmarked (see
2.1.2). Thus, the Possessive marking resolves the ambiguity asso-
ciated with the zero marking.
    For instance, in (569a) the Possessive marking precludes the
apposition interpretation (like in (563)), since it signals that the
modifier has a separate referent. The zero marking option would
have allowed both interpretations ('Alandin's servant' vs. 'servant
Alandin'). Similarly, in (569b), the Possessive marking on the head
indicates that the phrase ataqun num0 refers to the specific (pre-
viously mentioned) families, while otherwise it would have been
interpreted as an instance of quantification (see 2.1.3):

The choice between unmarked vs. marked option for encoding of
the Possessive relationship seems to be associated with the degree
of prominence accorded to the modifier referent. Roughly, two
situations are distinguished:
   First, the role of the modifier referent in the message can be
reduced to building an appropriate description of the head referent
                                      Noun phrases as noun modifiers   299(i.e., to serving as the ""reference point"" (Langacker 1993) for its
identification). This situation entails zero marking. Secondly, the
modifier referent can be conceived of as playing some independent
role in the overall information structure of the message (see 2.2.2)
or in the situation being described (see 2.2.3). In this situation,
Possessive marking is likely to be chosen.
    Note that this account explicitly relates the internal use of the
Possessive markers to their pronominal use (2.2.1.1): in both cases,
the controller of the Possessive marker has some other function in
the clause or in some higher-level text unit, apart from being the
Possessor for the entity referred to by the head.
    Furthermore, this analysis gets indirect support from the Pos-
sessive marking of the primary participant in Nominal and relative
clauses (see 0.1.2.1, 11.1). In these constructions, the primary par-
ticipant is encoded as the grammatical Possessor of the head NP (a
Nominal verb form or the relativized NP, respectively). Although
both zero marking and Possessive marking are available in both
constructions, the latter is applied much more frequently. This
preference is straightforwardly accounted for by the analysis sug-
gested here, insofar as the primary role in the situation signified
by a non-finite clause ensures a higher degree of prominence than
just the function of Possessive modifier.","[314, 315, 316, 317]"
"4. Closed classes
There are five closed classes of items: pronouns and related pro-
forms, numerals, postpositions, particles and interjections. Pro-
72   Chapter 4- Parts of speech and inflectional   paradigmsnouns and numerals have rich morphology which comprises nom-
inal, verbal, attributive and adverbial forms (see 7.1, 7.2). Some
postpositions have the locative paradigm and the Possessive mark-
ers (see 7.3, 8.5).
Chapter 5
Nominal morphology
1. Formation of major categories
Major nominal inflectional categories are Number, Case and Pos-
sessive. The markers are agglutinated to a stem or to each other
as represented by the following scheme (""X"" stands for stem; see
also Tables 10, 11):
(124)   X-NUMBER-POSSESSIVE-CASEThe whole paradigm is compatible with nouns and all Nominal
verb forms; the non-Possessive sub-paradigm, with interrogative,
demonstrative and indefinite pronouns (see 7.1.2, 7.1.3, 7.1.4), the
Case sub-paradigm, with personal pronouns (7.1.1).","[89, 90, 91]"
"4.5.2. Functions of the Reciprocal
4.5.2.1. Reciprocal constructions. The Reciprocal marks a recip-
rocal situation in which the reciprocal participants correspond to
the subject argument and some other argument of the verb. The
Reciprocal marker is productive and semantically very regular; it
can be attached to a verb whenever a reciprocal situation involv-
ing the relation expressed by that verb can be imagined. There
seem to be no purely grammatical restrictions on this operation,
228   Chapter   6. Verb   morphologye.g., in terms of transitivity, syntactic function assigned to the
secondary argument, etc. However, if the secondary participant
is represented by an NP other than direct or indirect object, an
additional free reciprocal marker is required (see 9.3.2.2).
    Although most instances of reciprocal marking involve the sub-
ject and the direct object arguments of a transitive verb, this seems
to be just a consequence of the fact that most two-argument verbs
are transitive (cf. 9.2.1). The examples in (430) illustrate this
most frequent case:
 (430) a. mit n'e+totcos-ti'i          sespedaijil'-ge

          'We pressed each other against the door.'

           'The two of them brought each other (if, for example,
           one of them was blind and the other lame).'
The examples in (431) illustrate the reciprocal marking involv-
ing the recipient (indirect object) participant (431a), and the ad-
dressee (431b); in the latter case, the additional free reciprocal
marking is needed (see 9.3.2.2 for further examples of this type).

The reciprocal participants are normally represented by a single
NP in the subject position:

See also 9.2.8 for another, marginal, option for encoding of the
reciprocal participants.
4.5.2.2. Natural reciprocals. The morphological reciprocal marker
can be attached to verbs signifying so called ""naturally recipro-
cal"" situations, without any significant change in the meaning, cf.
(430c) and (434a):

See also 3.3.2.3 for a natural reciprocal derived by means of an
Iterative suffix.
4.5.2.3. Incorporation. There are two attested cases of incorpo-
ration of a nominal stem between the reciprocal marker and verb
stem; the incorporated stem fills the patient/theme slot of the
verb.

                'Those Yukaghirs and those Evens used to understand
                each o t h e r ' s language; since they understood each
                other's language, they helped each other. [Kl]
Generally, incorporation-like phenomena are not characteristic of
Yukaghir, and the status of these cases within its grammar remains
unclear. It should be noted that neither a verb like *p0me-har)s'i-
'lice-search' nor one like *azu+medi- 'language-understand' exists
in Yukaghir independently; these combinations are possible only
in the context of the reciprocal. The form n'e-p0me-aijs'i-jejl'i 'we
are looking for each other's lice' is found in the texts collected by
                                        Valence-changing   morphology   231Jochelson (1900:47), but this is the only example of this type in
his data. The grammaticality of this form was confirmed by my
consultants in 1987 (see (435)). The second example is taken from
a text written down by myself in 1992, but I have not managed to
elicit any other instances of this phenomenon during my field work.
It thus remains unclear whether there are strong lexical restrictions
on this phenomenon, or if it is a rare (perhaps marginal), but
free (with respect to the lexical items involved) type of reciprocal
construction.
4.5.2.4. Lexicalization. Some combinations of the reciprocal
marker and verb stem are apparently lexicalized, e.g., n'e-mejnu-
'to get married, to join' (from mejnu- 'to take something'),
n'e-lej-nu-l-ben 'predator' (RECP-eat-iPFV-ATTR-RELNR), lit. 'one
who eats each other'.","[245, 246, 247, 248, 249]"
"
2.1.3. Quantification
If preceded by a quantifier, a zero-marked modifier can express a
certain (unit o f ) quantity:

         one-ATTR skin-PRED ask-OF:3SG <two-ATTR

296   Chapter 8. Noun phrase and postpositional   phrase 2.2. Possessive (head) marking: N P M NP#-POSS-CASE
This section is mainly concerned with the factors which trigger
overt Possessive marking, in contrast to the zero marking which
is also available for possessive relations (2.1.1). The Possessive
marking appears to signal that the Possessor (modifier referent) is
accorded a higher degree of clause-level prominence. More specif-
ically, it is conceived of either as the clause-level topic (2.2.2) or
as a participant involved in the situation (2.2.3).
   Thus, Possessive marking appears to involve a sort of discrep-
ancy between form and function: semantically, the Possessor is
assigned some clause-level role, while structurally its status as an
NP modifier is maintained. This property of the grammar makes
it possible to use the same morphological device for two essen-
tially different functions, which are kept formally apart in many
other languages, i.e., to subsume topicalization of the Possessor
(information-packaging function) and involvement (situation con-
strual function) under the same category of referential autonomy
expressed by the overt Possessive marker on the head (2.2.1).","[313, 314]"
" 5.1. Possessive pronouns vs. Possessive markers
Formally, the pronominal arguments of postpositions are encoded
in the same way as pronominal possessive modifiers of nouns, ei-
ther by the possessive forms of personal pronouns (7.1.1.2) or by
the Possessive marking (5.2, 2.2) on the postposition itself. Yet, in
NPs, the possessive forms of third person pronouns are reflexive,
that is, they signify that the Possessor is coreferential with the
subject of the clause. In postpositional phrases, this is not the
case, i.e., the possessive forms may (599), but need not (600) be
coreferential with the subject:

                'This woman's dog jumped around her showing
                affection.'
To some extent, the non-reflexive use of these forms is determined
by the fact that not all postpositions have the Possessive mor-
phology, i.e., the non-reflexive counterpart of possessive pronouns
is not always available (see 7.3 for the list of postpositions which
have Possessive forms). Quite predictably, since one member of
the opposition is not available, the opposition is neutralized.
   It should be noted, however, that the possessive pronouns may
be used non-reflexively with those postpositions which do take the
                                             Postpositional   phrases   321Possessive markers; see (600c) and (601):

          bag-DiM         near-POSS-LOC     Iie-INTR:3SG
          'The bag lay near him.' [F49]
In other words, the functional opposition between reflexive (free)
and non-reflexive (bound) pronominal modifiers is neutralized for
arguments of all postpositions, independently of the morphological
availability of the latter option in each particular case. It may be
assumed, therefore, that the noun-to-postposition grammatical-
ization in Yukaghir involves two partially independent processes:
  • Reinterpretation of the possessive modifier as the argument
    of a postposition. The possessive form of pronominal modi-
    fiers is preserved, but it is reinterpreted as a non-Possessive
    instance of the personal pronoun, hence the loss of the reflex-
    ive meaning (which is associated only with the possessive use
    of personal pronouns, see 7.1.1).
  • Loss of the nominal morphology, in particular, of the Posses-
    sive morphology.","[337, 338, 339]"
"1.5.4. Discontinuity
Discontinuity of NPs is not frequent, yet possible. First, a modifier
can be post-posed, while the nominal head occupies its typical
preverbal position (the elements of a discontinuous constituent
are shown by reversed angle brackets in the interlinear glosses):
(626) a. cül-ek         qodö-l comö-d'e         end'δη
         >meat-PRED< lie-SF >be.big-ATTR animal<

          'His arrows were over, Momusha's.' [F6]

                Ί will show you the hole in the earth, where we go
                out.' [F31]
Secondly, a Nominal clause can be interrupted by the main verb, so
that a constituent of the Nominal clause is postposed; in (627a), it
is the comitative adjunct associated with the subject of the Action
Nominal clause, in (627b), an adverbial clause subordinated to the
Result Nominal in the clause-initial position: (627) a. tä       noj l'e-de-jle       ju0-i]ä

2. Overview of verb patterns
2.1. Introductory         notes
Generally, the transitivity of a clause is fully determined by its
main verb. As shown in 9.1, in Yukaghir this property is associ-
ated rather with the pragmatic (information structuring) roles of
the NPs, rather than with their case role semantics. To put it a
little bit too straightforwardly, the transitive pattern is the Topic-
Focus pattern, rather than the Agent-Patient one. Accordingly,
intransitivity is associated with a single N P which is conceived of
as the most appropriate candidate for both ""communicative"" roles.
                                            Overview   of verb patterns   347This ensures a very wide domain of application of the transitive
pattern, i.e., this pattern covers situation types which are very far
from the semantic prototype of transitivity (including such mean-
ings as 'be afraid of', 'speak about', 'stand on', 'laugh at', etc.,
see 2.3). In fact, the vast majority of two-slot patterns and all the
patterns with more than two slots are transitive.
   Apart from the core participants, Yukaghir shows a rather close
correspondence between the case marking and the role interpreta-
tion of a slot. Instances of conventionalized deviations from the
case semantics (as described in 5.4.2) are very rare. They can be
summarized as follows:
  1. Some transitive verbs have Body Part slots for the Ablative
     or the Prolative NP (2.3.2).
  2. Both intransitive (2.5.1) and transitive (2.5.2) verbs can have
     the Ablative slot with partially unpredictable role semantics.
     Although in most cases the Ablative slot in such patterns
     can be described (more or less appropriately) in terms of a
     metaphorical ""source"" or ""starting point"", its specific instances
     appear to be conventional. Note, however, that the Ablative
     lends itself most easily (of all peripheral cases) to various
     metaphorical extensions, independently of its usage within
     verb patterns; see 5.4.2.5.2).
  3. There are marginal intransitive patterns with the Locative
     Experiencer (2.7.2.1) and the Dative Experiencer (2.7.1). The
     latter seems to be closely associated with the Benefactive
     (Malefactive) function of the Dative (see 5.4.2.1).
  4. Some verbs have a slot which can be filled either by the Loca-
     tive NP or by the Dative NP. For the verbs of movement (""Di-
     rectional"" slot, see 2.6), this variability could be accounted for
     in terms of the ""adverbial"" nature of the slot. It should be
     noted, however, that the directional reading of the Locative
     is possible only within this pattern. Furthermore, the same
     variability is preserved in the metaphorical applications of
     the Directional pattern (ii.1.6), as well as in the peripheral
     Experiencer slot (at least for some verbs; see 2.7.2).
348   Chapter 9. Syntax of the clauseNote that there are two types of valence patterns which are not dis-
cussed here: copular patterns (see 12.1) and patterns with prepo-
sitional slots (11.1-11.2).","[363, 364, 365, 366]"

this strategy, the verb can have the Singular form:

This agreement presumably suggests that the construction may
be analyzed as a clause-conjunction with dropped verb forms; al-
ternatively, it can be assumed that agreement is controlled by the
closest NP. 48
   If conjoined NPs constitute a ""typical group"", they can share a
single Possessive pronoun (preceding the whole group) or even a

The following examples illustrate its use for conjunction of Nom-

5. Postpositional phrases
Generally, arguments of postpositions are encoded in the same way
as modifiers of nouns:
  • The third person pronouns take the possessive form.
  • Nouns can have the Nominative or the Attributive form.
  • The argument of a postposition can control the Possessive
    marker on that postposition.
However, the distribution of these marking options differs from
that attested in noun phrases: the possessive forms of third person
pronouns are not reflexive (5.1), and the Possessive Attributive
form is much more common than in NPs (5.2).","[334, 335, 336, 337]"
"4. Valence-changing morphology
 4-1. Preliminaries
The structure of this section (and the preceding one) is based on
a semantic (functional) classification of morphemes. This solution
(resulting from the general principles outlined in i.3.1) obscures
some semantic and formal affinities which appear to be very im-
portant for Yukaghir verb morphology and have to be mentioned
here.
    First, the system of valence-changing in the narrow sense (those
grammatical items which are applied to relational expressions and
modify their valence patterns) employs, to a large extent, the same
set of morphs which are used for derivation of verbs from nominal
stems (see 4.2). Roughly, the same morph can derive Causative
verbs from both verbal and nominal stems (meaning, in the latter
case, 'cause to have X'); see 4.2, 4.3.1 and 4.3.3.1. Similarly, one
morph can derive Stative expressions from both verbs and nouns
(3.6). In other cases, Causative verbs are derived from verbs by a
suffix which, if applied to a noun, derives an intransitive verb with
the meaning 'get, receive X' (see 4.2 and 4.3.3.3). Although the
semantic affinity is less transparent in this case, yet the two types
of valence modification have something in common: the suffix adds
a new valence slot for the agent participant in both environments.
                                       Valence-changing   morphology   211If such correlations had been absolutely transparent and regular,
it would have been plausible to give up the more or less traditional
scheme adopted here, and to organize the presentation in accor-
dance with how Yukaghir organizes its morphology. Yet this is not
the case: as will be observed, the system of morphs which is abso-
lutely regular and productive, as far as the denominal derivation
is concerned, is somewhat less regular and transparent within the
domain of deverbal derivation. That is why a compromise solution
was chosen: a subsection on the denominal derivation is included
into the present section, yet it is kept apart from the valence-
changing morphology proper, which is discussed afterwards.
    A second type of correlation which could not be reflected in
the structure of the chapter is that between the valence-changing
morphology (in particular, the Causative) and the Internal Aspect
marking (see 3.3.2, 4.3.3.3, 4.3.3.5). Very roughly, the Causative
is strongly associated with the iterative (more precisely, distribu-
tive) meaning, and this association manifests itself formally at a
number of points. Since this correlation is even less transparent
and regular than the previous one, mainly because it is restricted
to the domain of non-productive derivation, it was hardly possi-
ble to organize the presentation in such a way as to highlight this
feature (however noteworthy it seems). This results in somewhat
arbitrary distribution of information on some suffixes between this
section and the preceding one. This deficiency is partly compen-
sated by cross-references within the relevant subsections and by
Appendix 2 which presents the non-productive verb derivation in
a purely form-to-function fashion.
    Note that the present section contains only very brief notes
on the distribution of the non-productive morphemes; whenever
a suffix can be attached to a closed group of verbs only, I just
state this and go on to discuss its semantics. Representative lists
of verbs taking each suffix are to be found in Appendix 2.","[228, 229]"

The formal variation described in 1.4.2 applies to the Action Nom-
inal and the Result Nominal verb forms (the markers -I and -öl re-
spectively, see £.1.3.1). In this case, the variation appears to have
a functional burden, namely, it distinguishes verb forms (where /1/
is dropped obligatorily) and nouns resulting from lexicalization of
those forms (where / I / is not dropped), cf.:(135)    Verb forms                             Nouns

The grammatical Possessive relation covers a wide range of re-
lationships between entities. As in many languages, it clusters
around three meanings, the part-whole relationship (136a), kin-
ship (136b), and belonging (136c). For further details on the se-
mantics of grammatical Possession, see 8.2.
    The bound Possessive suffixes -gi, -de- mark the Possessive re-
lation between the referent of the noun phrase and some third
person/entity which is not the subject of the clause within which
the noun phrase occurs (136a). In particular, the controller of the
Possessive marking can serve as a modifier within the same NP
(136b)-(136c). If the same relation holds between the referent and
the first or the second person, or between the referent and the
subject participant of the clause, the Possessive forms of personal
pronouns must be used (see 7.1.1.2).

The Possessive marking can be used for anaphoric reference to the
Possessor outside the clause:

Note that the Possessive marking need not be applied if the Pos-
sessor is a modifier within the same noun phrase:

For factors determining the choice between zero vs. Possessive
marking within an NP, see 5.2.2
   If attached to the Action Nominal or to the Result Nominal,
the Possessive suffix cross-references the subject of the nominal
clause, as in (140b), (151); see 0.1.2.1 for details.","[96, 97, 98]"
" 5.2. Attributive marking
The non-Possessive Attributive form is available for arguments of
postpositions, but occurs extremely rarely. In fact, there are but
few examples of this usage (602). This is quite predictable, since
the arguments of postpositions are normally referential, which pre-
cludes Attributive marking (see 2.3).

In contrast to this, the Possessive AttributivePossessive markinglin
postpositional phrases form is employed much more frequently for
arguments of postpositions than for noun modifiers.

If the argument of a postposition is an Action Nominal or a Re-
sult Nominal, this marking can be viewed as the most frequent,
""default"" version.

Chapter 9
Syntax of the clause
This chapter discusses the case marking of the core participants
in finite (1.1) and non-finite (1.2) clauses. The most remark-
able feature of case marking in Yukaghir is the extensive employ-
ment of the well-known affinities between the core participant roles
and pragmatic (or information-packaging) properties of NPs (1.3).
Section 1.4 provides summaries of syntactic properties which may
serve to identify the grammatical relations of subject, direct object
and indirect object.
   The most frequent word order is verb-final, yet the relative
order of constituents is largely determined by their pragmatic roles
(1.5).
   Verb valence patterns are described in section 2. Section 3
provides an overview of clausal adjuncts.","[339, 340, 341, 342, 343]"
" 1.3. Possessive forms
The Possessive marker is -Gi in the Nominative, -De- otherwise.
The Possessive sub-paradigm lacks the Predicative case (the Pos-
sessive Nominative is used instead; see 4.1.2, 4.1.3).
    The combination of the Possessive and the Dative markers re-
sults, in the vast majority of cases, in the short form in -d-in. The
full form in -de-r/in is also possible, but occurs only in few cases,
as an optional variant of the short form, e.g., nume-pe-de-ijin ~
nume-pe-d-in 'in/to their house'.
    The Accusative marker -gele commonly takes the form -jle after
the Possessive marker. The full variant is also possible, but very
infrequent. The choice of a variant does not depend on the stem,
as shown by the following pairs of forms:(131)   -de-jle            -de-gele
        iri-de-jle        iri-de-gele          'belly'
        n'umud'i-de-jle   n'umud'i-de-gele     'axe'
        qär-de-jle        qär-de-gele          'skin'
 1-4· Consonantal stems
1.4.1. Instrumental and Predicative markers
The initial j l j of a case marker is dropped after a consonant. This
is illustrated below by the Instrumental forms.
78   Chapter 5. Nominal   morphology(132)    Nominative        Instrumental
         sin'el'           sin'el'-e         'snare'
         eks'il'           eks'il'-e         'boat'
         pulut             pulut-e           'old man, husband'
         sasqul            sasqul-e          'paw, hand, foot'As a result, the two variants of the Predicative marker (see Table
10) are not distinguished after stems in / / / , / I ' / (see 4.1.3 on the
function of this variation).","[95, 96]"
"Attributive and Possessive marking are incompatible, that is, the
Attributive modifier cannot serve as the controller of the Posses-
sive marking on the head. 40
    The functional distinction between these structural options can
be described in terms of referential autonomy of the modifier: the
Possessive marking can be applied only if the modifier has a ref-
erent of its own, most often, specific and definite (see 2.2.1). In
contrast to this, the Attributive marking signifies that the mod-
ifier is non-referential (2.3). Finally, the zero marking option is
unmarked with respect to the referential autonomy of the modi-
fier (2.1), i.e., it can be employed independently of whether the
NP invokes a single referential entity or two separate entities.
290   Chapter 8. Noun phrase and postpositional phrase 2.1. Zero marking: NP M +NP H -CASE
In this construction, the modifier is in the Nominative case; the
head noun is marked for case according to the role of the NP in
the clause.
    Instances of this construction fall into two major classes: one
class comprises NPs which invoke two separate referential enti-
ties and establish a possessive relationship between these entities
(2.1.1); NPs of the other class invoke a single referent (apposition,
see 2.1.2). A special subgroup of the latter class is formed by NPs
with quantifiers, where a zero-marked modifier expresses a unit of
quantity (2.1.3).
    The interpretation of each particular NP is determined, in most
cases, by the lexical meanings of the nouns and/or by the context.
The construction itself is ambiguous with respect to referential au-
tonomy of the modifier; furthermore, in some cases, this ambiguity
remains unresolved (see 2.1.2).","[307, 308]"
" 1.4. On ethnonyms
The etymology of the ethnonym Yukaghir (alternative spellings
are Yukagir, Jukagir, Russian jukagir, jukagirskij) is unclear; this
is what Yukaghirs usually call themselves when they speak Rus-
sian. The alternative ethnonym Odul (Russian odul, odul'skij) cor-
responds to the Kolyma Yukaghir self-designation odul·, the Tundra
Yukaghir counterpart of this ethnonym is wadul. Strikingly, the
Tundra Yukaghirs sometimes call themselves odul when speaking
Russian.

2. Sociolinguistic situation in Nelemnoye
According to a sociolinguistic investigation undertaken by Nikolay
Vakhtin in 1987 (1992), 29 Nelemnoye Yukaghirs spoke the Yuk-
aghir language, although it was the first language for only nine of
them, see Table 4.
   None of them spoke only Kolyma Yukaghir, all spoke Russian,
and all but four spoke Yakut. Table 5 presents some statistical
data on the degree of language competence among the Nelemnoye
Yukaghirs. It was assessed by means of expert ratings, according
to a seven-point scale, ""1"" being the highest (excellent language
knowledge), ""7"" the lowest (no knowledge of the language). 7
   As shown by these tables, the first language of all Yukaghirs
under 60 is Russian, although many have Yukaghir as their mother
tongue. The youngest generation is practically monolingual. Their
native language is evidently Russian, which is the only language
used at school and at the kindergarten. Yukaghir has been taught
at school since 1985/86, yet this does not seem to have changed
the situation drastically.
   These data give clear evidence of the extremely rapid decline
of Kolyma Yukaghir. Yet, one must assume that a similar socio-
linguistic situation was found by Jochelson at the end of the 19th
century (2.1.3). How, then, has the language been maintained for
                                               Accents and varieties   23so long? A possible hypothesis is that the language competence
of the middle-aged group is always underestimated by the eldest
generation and by themselves, and that when a group of speak-
ers grows older, they return to communication in their mother
tongue (Vakhtin 1992:79). This hypothesis is supported by a re-
cent slight (but nevertheless apparent) rise of the role of Yukaghir,
due mainly to the global rise of ethnic self-awareness on the ter-
ritory of the former Soviet Union. As far as I could observe in
1992, many relatively young Yukaghirs (of about 45-50) seemed
to have ""recalled"" their mother tongue, which they had pretended
not to speak at all in 1987, and now spoke Yukaghir with their el-
der fellow-citizens rather often. This ""regressive shift"" apparently
indicates that the language competence of the middle-aged group
is actually higher than was assessed in 1987. However, the dif-
ferent generations clearly speak distinct varieties of the language:
generally, the younger the speaker, the more notable contact phe-
nomena in their language (see Section 3 on age-defined varieties,
Section 4 on the effect of language contact on Kolyma Yukaghir).","[39, 40, 41]"
"3. Quantifiers
Quantifiers comprise cardinal numerals (7.2.1), universal quanti-
fiers (7.1.5), and scalar quantifiers (cä- 'be few', ninge- 'be many'),
see also 2.1.3 for quantification phrases. This section describes
only the scalar quantifiers. The scalar quantifiers belong to the
class of verbs.
 (584) a. lebejdi ninge-j
          berries be.many-lNTR:3SG
          'There were a lot of berries.'
        b. cu0l'e-d+omm        parä-ge  comölben

                'In the ancient people's time, there were few elk.' [F34]
                                                      Quantifiers   311
When used as noun modifiers, they take the verbal Active At-
tributive form (6.1.2.2). The same lexical items are used for scalar
quantification of count nouns (585) and mass nouns (586). The
head noun takes the Singular form (see 5.3.1.4, 5.3.1.5).
(585) a. met ninge-j           soromo-k
         I     [be.many-ATTR] person-PRED

          'Many birds gathered.' [F5]

           I    place-LOC [be.few-ATTR] berry-PRED be-SF
           'At my place there were few berries.'
(586) a. öä-je          legul-ek      kej-met
         [be.few-ATTR] food-PRED give-OF:2PL
         'You have given me little food.'
       b. ninge-j             legul-ek   nado+qö-l,
          [be.many-ATTR] food-PRED necessary-STAT-SF
          n'er-ek,      όζϊ-k
          cloth-PRED water-PRED
          'We need a lot of food, (we need) clothing, (we need)
          water.' [F31]
If the quantified NP is the direct object, the scalar quantifier can
float to the preverbal position. In this construction, the quantifier
takes a special form in -ö, thus:
(587) a. terike, legul ningö ä-k
         wife    food many make-IMP:2SG
         'Wife, make a lot of food.' [F24]
       b. lebejdi-le ningö  saqal'e-s-l'el-rja
          berries    many gather-CAUS-lNFR-3PL:TR
          'They have gathered a lot of berries.'
312   Chapter 8. Noun phrase and postpositional   phrase         c. tolow tat ningö nurj-i
            deer CA many find-TR:lPL
            'We have found lots of deer.'
         d. legul-e öälö kej-ηά
            food    little give-3PL:TR
            'They gave a small amount of food.'
         e. anil nahä öälö ϊ-de-j
            fish very little get.caught-CAUS-TR:lPL
            'We have caught a very small amount of fish.'
The distinction between the ""internal"" quantification (as in (586))
and the construction with quantifier floating is clearly associated
with the grammatical Focus (see 12.2-12.3): quantifier floating is
used if the Ο participant itself is outside the scope of assertion
(hence, cannot be marked for the grammatical Focus). Scalar
quantifiers in the modifier function regularly attract grammatical
Focus marking; see (586).
   If the object NP is recoverable from the context, it can be
dropped, so that only the quantifier is present in the clause:
 (588) a. met-in öälö kej-met
          I-DAT little give-TR:2PL
          'You have given me a small amount (of it).'
         b. ningö     pundie-nu-l'el-u-m
            many tell-lPFV-lNFR-0-TR:3SG
            n'e-leme-die-le           el-hahid'i-t
            [NEG-what-DlM-iNSTR NEG+conceaL-SS:iPFv]
            'He told a lot, without concealing anything.' [F50]
   Apparently, a similar construction with quantifier floating is
possible for cardinal verbs (7.2.1.2), yet it occurs very rarely:
 (589)      mit comölben-pe d'e n'elbe-t-i   ataqlö
            we elk-PL        DP skin-TR:lPL two
            'We skinned both elk.'
See also 7.1.5.1 on the syntactic behavior of the universal quanti-
fier.

is taken to cover all cases where one type of participation in the
event is ascribed to two (or more) separate entities (represented
by different lexical items). Yukaghir has three different strategies
for N P conjunction, which make use of the Comitative case (4.1),
asyndeton (4.2) and the connective adverb tähile (4.3).","[328, 329, 330, 331]"
"1.2.1.6. The Temporal Demonstrative forms refer either to the
absolute time of the event (453) or to the temporal distance be-
tween two events (454). The form täne is obsolete, and the respec-

(453b).

1.2.2. The functions of Demonstratives1.2.2.1. The deictic function. The three Demonstrative series are
distinguished in terms of the distance from the point of reference
(in particular, visibility (Krejnovich 1982:235-237)) and in terms
of the control and direct availability for the speaker.
   The series in ti- refers to most proximate entities and/or lo-
cations which are directly available to the speaker (for example,
something belonging to the speaker):
 (455) a. ti-rjide         ejre-s'
            here-DlR      walk-PFV:lNTR:3SG
            'He has come here ( = to me).'

           that-LOC this raft   make-TR:lPL
           'That is why we have made this raft.' [F9]
The series in add- refers to entities and/or locations which are
not taken to be remote (in particular, they can be visible for
the speaker), but are not directly available and/or not under the
speaker's control; such entities often belong or are nearer to the
addressee or to a third person:
 (456) a. editj cilge   met-in kej-k

Finally, the Distal series in tä refers to entities and/or locations
which are considered remote and invisible to the speaker:
(457) a. tarj meme qol+l'e?
         that bear     where+be(lTR:3SG)?
         'Where is that bear?' [F17]
      b. u0+yö-l-öl-yin          tä-rjide  met-ek

         erd'ie-s-mele
         want-CAUS-OF:3SG
         Ί want to return to the days of my youth.' [F58]
The Locative demonstratives of the ία-series can be combined with
the item ejmi 'across, on the other side' (see 3.1.5.2 on its use as a
postposition; cf. also Krejnovich 1982:237). In contrast with the
simple forms, such combinations can be used only in the deictic
function:
(458) a. ejmi+tä-yide       qon-delle izulbe
         [across-there-DlR go-SS:PFv] tiredness
         k0u-de-t-i
         gO-CAUS-FUT-TR:lPL
         'Let us go there and have a rest.' [F31]
       b. ejmi+tä        jaqa-r/ide         palatka-ge
          [across-there arrive-SS:COND] tent-LOC
          jaqa-te-je
          arrive-FUT-lNTR:lSG
          'If I reach that place there, I will be able to reach the
          tent.'
The nominal Demonstratives tu0n and adu0n can be used as deic-
tic subjects of a cleft-like construction, whereby the deictic element
is followed by a complete Focus-marking clause (see 12.2.3).
1.2.2.2. The anaphoric function. The demonstrative pronoun
tabun is often used to pick up a previously mentioned entity. This
is the only way to refer back to an inanimate entity (459); for ref-
246   Chapter    7. Morphology   of closed   classeserence to an animate entity, a personal pronoun can be used as
well. Generally, the demonstrative (in contrast with a personal
pronoun) involves a certain amount of contrast. In particular, it
often refers to the entity introduced in the previous sentence as
the grammatical Focus:
 (459) a. tarj pulut        nume-ijin    qon-delle tude
          [that old.man house-DAT go-SS:PFv] his

          'The old man went home and put some snow into his

Moreover, the demonstratives are strikingly more common in the
grammatical Focus position than the personal pronouns (460); see
12.3.2.3 on the pronominal Focus.

The other Nominal demonstratives are impossible in this function.

can be used as a determiner when the noun phrase refers to an
aforementioned entity:
(461) a. tay pajpe   ataq-un    u0-n'e-l'el

          'These hunters were pursuing it, but not catching
          up.' [F34]
In addition, there is a complex Attributive form tin+tarj 'that'
(Krejnovich 1982:237), which can be used only to refer back to
an aforementioned entity, i.e., this form resolves the ambiguity
between deictic and anaphoric interpretations of the Attributive
demonstratives:
(462) a. tintaij      ataq-un      pajpe-d-hu0r-pe          pude

          'That old woman gave (him) some tea.' [F19]
Krejnovich (1982:237) suggests that this form represents the frozen
combination of the Attributive demonstratives tirj 'this' and tar)
'that'. In addition to this form, he cites a nominal complex form
tin-tamun, which is not attested in my corpus.
1.2.2.3. The resumptive function. The Nominal demonstratives
are often used to refer to an aforementioned event as a whole;
this function is particularly typical for the demonstrative tabun
~ tamun, yet tu0n is also possible (see also i^.2.1.2):

The demonstrative pro-forms can also be used as main clause cor-
relates for correlative subordinate clauses (see 13.5.3).
1.2.2.4. Discourse-linking function. The distal Demonstratives in
tä, in particular the Ablative form tat and the Local forms of the
Nominal demonstrative tabun, serve as a very general device link-
ing a clause to the preceding discourse (see i^.2.1.2, 14-3). In
this function, these forms can be glossed as 'then, so, thus, that is
why', etc.; the form tat serves as most semantically vague connec-
tive adverbial (it is therefore represented as CA in the interlinear
glosses.)

The pronoun p0n ~ pen can refer to the physical environment
(with a meaning like 'world', 'nature', 'environment', etc.; see
(465)-(466)), or to the physical condition of a person (467). The
former meaning is most often evoked in descriptions of weather
situations, seasonal changes, etc. (465); see also 9.2.2.2 for this
clause pattern. However, a less conventionalized usage is possible
as well (466) (for convenience, this word is glossed as 'it' in the
interlinear translations).

considered the bound (grammaticalized) form of p0n ~ pen.36
250   Chapter    7. Morphology   of closed   classes 1.3. Interrogative pro-forms
Most interrogative pro-forms are derived from the interrogative
stem qo- ~ qa-. e.g., qodo 'how', qodi-t 'why', qamun 'how many'
(for more interrogatives, see Table 19); there are three other in-
terrogative words, two interrogative pronouns, kin 'who, whose'
and lerne ~ neme 'what, who', and the Interrogative adverbial
nor/on 'what for'. The Interrogative pronouns have the regular
mon-Possessive nominal paradigm (as described in 5.1), but for-
mally slightly different predicative forms, kin-tek and lem-dik ~
nem-dik respectively (Krejnovich 1982:234-235):
 (468) a. kin-tek                jaqte-l?
                who-PRED sing-SF
                'Who is singing?' [F13]
        b. tet lem-dik      irji-me               lebie budie?
           you what-PRED be.afraid.of-OF:2sG earth SUPER
           'What are you afraid of on the earth?' [F31]
The Interrogatives are used in direct and indirect questions
(13.2.2, 13.5.2) and in correlative subordinate clauses (see 13.5.3).
   The Locative Interrogative qon 'where' and the Manner inter-
rogative qodo 'how' can form phonological complexes with the ex-
istential verb I'e 'be': qol+l'e- 'Where is/was?' (see 13.2.2.1),
qodo+l'e- 'How is/was?' (see 13.2.2.2). The latter combines also
with the verb ä- 'make': qod-ä- 'What/how did (A) behave with
respect to (O)?' (see 13.2.2.2 for examples).","[261, 262, 263, 264, 265, 266, 267, 268]"
" 4-4- Transitivizers and detransitivizers
4.4.1. Applicative
There are two suffixes which add the direct object slot to the va-
lence pattern of an intransitive verb, -re- and -n- (i.e., applicative
suffixes). Note that the former has a number of other functions (in
particular, Causative, see 4.3.3.5), while the latter is specialized
for the applicative function. Each can be applied to a very small
group of verbs (see Appendix 2). The semantics of the new slot
is determined by the meaning of the verb; in fact, in most cases,
the verb meaning implies presence of the corresponding partici-
pant in the situation being described, so that the impact of an
applicative suffix is limited to assigning the direct object role to
this participant. Some examples:
 (423) a. tät jaqte-t                     modo-de-ge is'
                [CA sing-SS:lPFV]         [sit-3SG-DS]   long-time

           'The eagle appears to have lied to me.' [F19]
4.4.2. Detransitive
There are three suffixes which detransitivize verbs by elimination
of the direct object slot from the valence pattern, -d '(e)-, -ze-, and
-de-. Each applies to a restricted group of verbs (see Appendix 2).
In most cases, the semantic impact of these suffixes is to construe
the situation as having no specific patient participant, cf. the
following pairs of sentences:
(425) a. nem-dik      aduon oji-me
         what-PRED it         bark-OF:3SG

                'So I entered the house and began to search, (but) I
                saw nobody.'
In other cases, the patient is obiviously present, but remains
unspecified; this case is illustrated by sentence (427c) for verbs
pan-de- 'cook' and lerj-de- 'eat' (sentences (427a)-(427b) exem-
plify the corresponding transitive verbs).

                Afanasij, the old man, said: . . . ' [K4]
With some verbs, the suffixes -d'- and -ze- have a middle-like func-
tion, i.e., they signify that the agent acts on his own body:
 (428) a. δζϊ              min-delle               tat      ajle-n-d'e33

Cf. 6.4.5.3 on the regular Reflexive marking.
                                            Valence-changing   morphology   2274-5. Reciprocal and Reflexive
4.5.1. Formation
The reciprocal marker is n'e-, the reflexive marker, met-. These
morphemes cannot be combined within one verb form, i.e., the re-
ciprocal and reflexive meanings are treated by Yukaghir grammar
as opposed members of one category.
(429) a. met tudel ju0
          I    he    see(TR:lSG)
          Ί saw him' [I]
       b. mit      n'e-ju0-jü'i
          we       RECP-see-lPL:lNTR
           'We saw each other' [I]
        c. tudel     met-ju0-j
          he        REFL-see-3SG:iNTR
           'He is looking at himself' [I]
Both the reciprocal and the reflexive decrease verb valence, which
in the vast majority of cases results in formal shift from the Tran-
sitive agreement pattern to the Intransitive one.
    Phonologically, these morphemes are characterized by a looser
connection with the stem than the suffixes, so that the boundary
between a prefix and its stem may be described as internal open
juncture. For example, clustering of vowels on morpheme bound-
aries is prohibited within the postfixal part of a word, but possible
on a""preverbal"" boundary, e.g., n'e+aji- 'to shoot each other' (see
also 5.2.3.1).","[242, 243, 244, 245]"
"3.2.3. Directional postposition
laiji ~ larjin ~ laijide 'to, towards, in the direction of'. The
     semantic distinctions between these forms can be formulated
     only in terms of tendencies: the form lay in seems to imply
     movement up to the final goal named by the noun (530), in
     contrast with the form larji, which can be used just to specify
     just the direction of the movement (529). The form laijide
     seems to be more frequent in the meaning 'to somebody's
     place' (531). The form lar/in commonly has the temporal
     meaning 'by, until' (532). For adverbial clauses built by means
     of this postposition, see 11.4.1.2. (529) a. 0ndie larji    qoni

             why always eagle.owl like AFF-cry-lTR:2SG
             'Why do you always cry like an eagle owl?' [K5]
The combination of the postposition tite with an ethnic name can
be used to signify the language:(535)      odul tite       '(speak) like a Yukaghir, in Yukaghir'
          luci tite        '(speak) like a Russian, in Russian'
          jaqal tite       '(speak) like a Yakut, in Yakut'In the following examples, the same (semantic) pattern is applied
to common nouns:

             'Egor began to imitate the swan's voice.' [K4]
There is a qualitative form titimie- 'similar to', which is derived
from this postposition by means of the qualitative suffix -mie-
(6.3.6.4.2). This form shows the same behavior as the qualitative
demonstratives (1.2.1.5), that is, it is verb-like (537a), with only

Noun phrase and postpositional phrase
1. The structure of the noun phrase
 1.1. Overview of NP types
There are three major structural types of NPs: (i) a pronoun, (ii) a
noun with optional preceding modifiers, (iii) a nominalized clause.
These types are briefly introduced in this section, with references
to other parts of the grammar where they are discussed in detail.
Pronouns (in the strict sense, i.e., pro-NPs). This class com-
    prises personal pronouns (7.1.1.1), nominal forms of the
    demonstrative and interrogative pronouns (7.1.2.1), the in-
    definite pronouns sar 'something' (7.1.4.4) and ile 'some'
    (7.1.4.5), and the substantivized forms of the modifiers jen
    '(an)other' (7.1.4.6), mus'in ~ bucun (7.1.5.2) and irkin 'one'
    (7.2.1.1).
Nouns plus (optional) preceding modifiers. The major for-
   mal types of modifiers are:
       • Unmarked NPs, which may (538c) but need not (538a)-
         (538b) be cross-referenced by the Possessive marker on
         the head. Some examples:

      also 2.1.3 for quantification phrases.","[294, 295, 296, 297, 298, 299, 300, 301, 302]"
"2.3.1. Case marking and grammatical Focus
Case marking patterns in main clauses are dominated by the Focus
system. Grammatical Focus is marked by means of the Predicative
case and an appropriate verb form (see Table 3). This marking
works on an ergative basis, that is, it can be applied to intransitive
subjects and direct objects, as shown in (7):
(7) a. tat touke-lek       jedej-l
       CA dog-PRED appear-SF
       'Then a / t h e dog appeared.' [K3]
     b. locil-ek  ti-tä        piecet-nu-l'el-mele
        fire-PRED here-there kindle-iPFV-lNFR-OF:3SG
        '(She) made campfires here and there.' [K3]
The major function of the grammatical Focus is to delimit the
scope of assertion from the preceding material (either within or
outside the given clause), whereby the NP marked for Focus is
conceived as the left-most (i.e., the first in the linear order) con-
stituent within the scope of assertion.
    If a clause is marked for grammatical Focus, no other case mark-
ing of core participants is needed. Similarly, if the subject is first
or second person, and the direct object is third person, both occur
10     Chapter   1.   Introductionin the Nominative (unmarked) case (8a). Otherwise, the case-
marking pattern is nominative-accusative (8b)-(8c).
 (8) a. met                tolow                 kudede
           I(NOM)    deer(NOM)                   kill(TR:lSG)
           Ί killed a d e e r . ' [I]
       b. met             tet-ul           ju0
           I(NOM) you-ACC              see(TR:lSG)
           Ί s a w y o u ( S G ) . ' [I]        c. tudel    met k0nme-gele                      ju0-m
           he(NOM) my friend-ACC                       See-TR:3SG
           'He saw my friend.' [I]
If the direct object is represented by an indefinite NP, the Instru-
mental case form is used instead of the Accusative:
 (9)       tudel       tolow-le    kudde-m
           he(NOM) deer-lNSTR kill-TR:3sG
           'He killed a deer.' [I]
Examples (8)-(9) show that Yukaghir lacks a uniform direct ob-
ject encoding; the choice of marking depends on placement of the
Focus, person of the subject, and the referential properties of the
NP itself.","[27, 28]"
"1.3.3. Structural ambiguity of clause chains
The structural options outlined in 1.3.1-1.3.2 are distinguishable
only if the chain contains an NP which demonstrably belongs to
the controlling clause, but not to the switch-reference clause, since
the linear position of such an NP can indicate the degree of struc-
tural cohesion between clauses. Yet most instances of clause chain-
ing simply do not contain NPs which would be able to signal the
type of structure involved. This structural ambiguity is a direct
consequence of two basic syntactic properties of Yukaghir, the ex-
tensive use of zero anaphora and the verb-final order.
   Indeed, if a shared participant with nonconstant case role is
380   Chapter 10. Clause   chainingomitted, the distinction between the linear and the nesting struc-
ture (see 1.3.1.1) is neutralized, cf. (690) and (687).
 (690) a. merie-de-ge           qon-te-m
            [fly-3SG-DS] gO-CAUS-TR:3SG
            'He flew and it (the wind) carried him.' [F20]

           'He came closer to the fireplace, and she recognized
           him.'
On the other hand, if all participants of the controlling clause sit-
uation are involved in the switch-reference clause situation in the
same case roles (691), they are likely to precede all verb forms
independently of the structural option involved. Given the verb-
final word order, a chain-initial NP representing a shared partic-
ipant may be taken to belong to either clause (and be dropped
in the other), or otherwise to the merged complex as a whole (as
in (689)). In (691), the linear analysis is represented with square
brackets, the nesting analysis, with curly brackets.

           'Charchahan killed the ogre by cutting off his head

The structural ambiguity of most ordinary chains appears to be
an essential property of this strategy of clause linking (rather than
an artifact of inadequate tools of syntactic analysis). Instead of a
strict formal opposition between co-ordination and subordination,
the clause-chaining offers a rather flexible device for combining
clauses exhibiting various degrees of backgrounding and semantic
cohesion (see 2.3-2.4).
                                           Semantics   of ordinary    chains    3812. Semantics of ordinary chains
2.1. General semantic properties and ""loose"" chaining
Ordinary chaining involves three semantic properties:
  1. The clause chain expresses temporal relations between the
     situations (a switch-reference clause situation can be either
     prior to or simultaneous with the controlling clause situation);
     see 2.2.
  2. Clause chaining involves some degree of backgrounding of the
     non-finite clauses, or, the other way round, the finite clause
     is accorded the primary prominence; see 2.3.
  3. Clause chaining implies thematic unity between clauses,
     which may entail various degrees of semantic cohesion (2.4).
These properties are characteristic of all instances of ordinary
chaining and determine the functional distinction between the
chaining and the mere sequencing of finite clauses. However,
within this functional domain, the semantic impact of chaining
varies from presenting a sequence of events as a coherent stretch
of discourse to signaling rather tight semantic relations between
propositions. The former pole is instantiated by chains describing
a coherent series of subsequent events.

                'Once he came, and his wife said: . . . ' [F49]
The order of clauses in such a chain is iconic, i.e. it reflects the tem-
poral order of events; thus, the temporal interpretation of clause
chains does not differ from the ""default"" interpretation of sequences
of finite clauses. The deranking is also uniquely determined by the
temporal order (the finite clause always describes the last event),
hence, the backgrounding effect is not significant. Finally, the se-
mantic cohesion amounts to the temporal adjacency of events and
some sort of discourse coherence (or thematic unity). In sum, the
chaining is employed simply as a discourse structuring device and
involves a minimum of semantic implications.
    The following sections demonstrate that each of the properties
outlined above can have a more significant impact on the interpre-
tation of a clause chain. This semantic variation correlates with
the degree of structural cohesion: the ""loose"" chains as in (692) ex-
hibit the linear structure, while a higher degree of backgrounding
or semantic cohesion may involve the nesting or merged structure
(1.3). Besides, the degree of semantic cohesion may determine the
choice of the Perfective vs. Imperfective SS form in a consecutive
chain (see 2.4.1). However, no strict grammatical distinctions can
be drawn between various semantic subtypes of ordinary chains.","[397, 398, 399, 400]"

262   Chapter    7. Morphology    of closed   classesfier. The numerals for 'five' and 'nine' do not have the noun-like
Attributive form, hence the Attributive form of the respective car-
dinal verb is used in this function (494c). The numeral for 'ten' is
commonly used attributively in the Nominative form (lacking for
other numeral stems), (494d).

noun is derived from a verb marked for Imperfective, either by the
regular Imperfective marker -nu- (6.3.2), or by one of the Iterative

The suffix -ra- derives a few substantives denoting various items of
the household. The suffix is compatible with nominal (260a), ver-
bal (260b) and adverbial (260c) stems. In addition, it is attested
in a few synchronically non-derived stems (260d).

words with similar semantics, e.g., loska-rä 'spoon' (Russian
lozhka 'spoon'), k0use-rä 'ladle' (Russian kovsh 'ladle').
   The suffix can be also distinguished in a small group of other
derived substantives, which do not belong to this semantic group:(261)    cine-rä              'a sunk part of tree'

        decayed.stuff-DER
        ugurce-rä             'poplar'
        ski-DERA small group of nouns are derived by the suffix -zä-, which can be
considered a variant of -rä-, e.g., §0lien-zä 'cedar bush' (cf. solie
'cedar nut'), lamun-zä 'a floating part of tree' (cf. lamut with
apparently the same meaning).
134     Chapter 5. Nominal   morphology6.1.8. The suffix -(i)l'-
The suffix -(i)l' derives a closed set of de-verbal nouns, which
signify mostly a typical agent or instrument involved the action
denoted by the verb stem, i.e., it has a meaning like 'somebody
or something which does V' (Krejnovich 1982:86-87). T h e list of
attested examples is:(262)      cekc-il'               'foreman'

There are some other suffixes, attested in one or two cases each

          im-ol         'riding deer' (ima- 'sit on deer back, boat, etc.')
          sogi-je       'pocket' (sogi 'bag')
          αη-ur         'palate' (αηα 'mouth')
6.2.    Compounds
The only regular type of compounding is of the form N i - A T T R + N 2 .
As described in 5.3.1.2.5, from the phonological point of view, the
Attributive form cannot be considered a fully free word form (given
                                                  Nominal   derivation   135the possible alternation -d ~ -n under phonological conditions de-
termined by the head noun). That is why it is not easy to delineate
noun phrases with Attributive dependent nouns and compounds
based on the same structural scheme (see examples (230)). What
has to be stated is that there are such collocations with the fol-
lowing properties (which distinghuish these collocations from those
described in 5.1.1):
 1. The meaning of the combination is not predictable from the
    meanings of its components.
 2. Before a vowel-initial stem, only the variant -d of the Attribu-
    tive marker is allowed; its alternation with -n is allowed (and
    required) only before a consonant.
 3. With respect to the Possessive marking, the collocation be-
    haves like a single noun stem, i.e., the Possessive marking on
    the Attribute (the Possessive Attributive form, see 5.1.2) is
    disallowed.
Some examples:
(264)       arjd'e-n-sorome            'pupil'
        eye-ATTR-person
         sä-d-abut                     'coffin'
        tree-ATTR-case
         aijd'e-d-abut                 'entrails, internal fat'

        jös'e-d-amun                    'buttock'
        lump-ATTR-boneThis way of word formation can be applied for naming new phe-
nomena, cf. two alternative nouns for spectacles, soj-d-arjd'e
(stone-ATTR-eye) and aijd'e-d-ajbt   (eye-ATTR-shade).
136     Chapter   5. Nominal   morphology   In some cases, one member of such a compound does not occur
independently:(265)     atja-n-muge 'lip'                          ar/a 'mouth'
          jouho-d-ari 'bag'                          jouho 'back'

Verb morphology
1. Major types of verb forms
The verb paradigm falls into four subparadigms: the Finite forms,
the Attributive forms, the Nominal forms, and the switch-reference
forms (converbs). This section describes how these forms are built,
and provides an overview of their functions (which are treated in
more detail in the respective chapters on syntax).","[148, 149, 150, 151, 152, 153, 154, 155, 156, 157]"
"2.2.2. Topicalization
Many instances of internal Possessive marking involve topicaliza-
tion of the Possessor, i.e., the clause is construed as being about
the entity cross-referenced by the Possessive marker. Although
identification of a particular clause as an instance of topicaliza-
tion is often controversial, there are some clear examples which
demonstrate that this factor is in play:
(570) a. tudel      ninge-j          soromo-gi
          he        <be.mant-ATTR    person-POSS>
           oj-l'e
          NEG-be(NEG:3SG)
          'He does not have a large family, (lit. He, his large
          family does not exist.)'
300   Chapter 8. Noun phrase and postpositional   phrase        b. taij   paj     touke-gi l'ie-1'el

           four-VR-INTR:3SG
           'This elk had four forelegs (lit.: This elk, his forelegs
           were four.)' [F34]
         e. mit     emd'e         azü-gi
            <our younger.sibling> word-POSS
            medi-s'
            be.heard-lNTR:3SG
            'One could hear our brother speaking (lit. 'Our
            brother, his words were heard.' )
         f. pude        qodö-l     §0gt ar/il'-gi   johodaj-delle
            [<[outside lie-ANR] bag> hole-POSS open-ss:PFv]
            el+l'u0-k
            NEG+See-IMP:2SG
            'The bag which lies outside, do not open it and look
            (what is inside).' [F19]
In examples like (570) the controller of Possessive marker might
have been analyzed as the ""syntactic topic"", i.e., as a left-detached
constituent resumed by the Possessive marker within the comment,
rather than as a modifier within the clause-initial NP. This analysis
appears to have a number of advantages:
   First, it conforms with the syntax of switch reference (i^.1.3.2)
and relativization (ii.3.1.4), insofar as the controller of the Pos-
sessive marker can serve as the syntactic ""pivot"" in these con-
struction types. Secondly, this analysis would subsume internal
and pronominal instances of the Possessive marking under a single
                                            Noun phrases as noun modifiers   301grammatical category, inasmuch as the controller of the Possessive
markers was to be analyzed as ""external"" in both cases. Finally,
the construction under discussion would be explicitly identified
with structurally and semantically similar ""double-subject"" con-
structions in topic-prominent languages (Li and Thompson 1976).
   However, there seems to be some strong evidence against such
an analysis. In a number of examples, the topic interpretation
does not seem semantically plausible; more importantly from the
structural point of view, the controller of the Possessive marking
need not be clause-initial:
(571) a. terike-gi        pude        uk-ej-delle                towke-le
           [wife-POSS o u t s i d e   go.out-PFV-SS:PFV]        dog-iNSTR
           ulte-m         meme        cuge-de-ge
          tie-TR:3sG      bear        trace-POSS-LOC
          'His wife went outside and fastened the dog on the
          bear's track.' [F54]
       b. tabun-ge tudä      taij     lebie-n+pugil'-pe
          that-LOC that.time that earth-ATTR+lord-PL
          es'ie-pe-gi     mon-u-l
          father-PL-POSS say-O-SF
          'The father of the former earth lords replied:
          <...>' [F9]
See also (569), (574). Thus, the analysis of the Possessor as ""topic""
does not provide a semantically adequate account for all instances
of internal Possessive marking.
   In addition, the controller of Possessive marking must immedi-
ately precede the NP bearing the marker, i.e., the Possessor and
the Possessed cannot be separated from each other by any other
elements of the clause. 44 This observation apparently undermines
the clause-external analysis of the Possessor.
   And last, but not the least, the syntactic notion of topic, if
identified on the basis of sentences like in (570), would be limited
to this particular construction type, i.e., there is no evidence for
prominence of syntactic topics other than Possessors in Yukaghir
syntax.
302   Chapter 8. Noun phrase and postpositional   phrase   These considerations suggest that topicality should be viewed
as a pragmatic factor which ensures a sufficient degree of promi-
nence of the Possessor to trigger the morphological marking of its
referential autonomy (see 2.2.1), but does not change its syntactic
status, i.e., the Possessor retains the syntactic properties of noun
modifiers.","[317, 318, 319, 320]"
"2.8. Functions of the               Imperative
The Imperative has the usual range of meaning, e.g., command,
request, proposal, admonition, etc.
 (338) a. tet jaqte-k          kejien
          you sing-iMP:2SG at.the.beginning
           'Sing first!' [F21]

           right-QLT-INTR:3SG RECP-take-PL-IMP-3
           'That's right, let them marry.' [F3]
The second person Imperative with the suffix -ge- (see Table 14)
is used to express commands or requests which have to be fulfilled
later (Krejnovich 1982:149).
(339) a. tet   colhoro kuded'e lek-telle      jaqte-ge-k
         [you hare     liver    eat-SS:PFv] sing-iMP-2sG

          'Finish up and then come!' [F36]
See also 10.2.1, 10.3.1.3 on clause chains with the Imperative finite
clause.
   The Imperative can be negated in the regular way (340c), yet
in the second person Imperative this formation normally involves
the Prohibitive suffix -le- (see Table 14).

178   Chapter    6. Verb   morphology2.9. Periphrastic Tense-Mood, Forms
2.9.1. The Periphrastic Prospective2.9.1.1. Formation. The Periphrastic Prospective form consists of
the Auxiliary I'e- 'be' and the Supine; the final / n / of the Supine
can be assimilated into / / / (see 5.3.1.3). In some cases, just the
Dative form of the Action Nominal is used for the Periphrastic
Prospective. This form has been described by Krejnovich as the
mood of ""being ready"" (naklonenije gotovnosti) (1982:147-149).
    The Auxiliary can be in any form, including the non-finite
forms. If the lexical verb is transitive, the agreement of the Aux-
iliary vacillates: it can follow either the Intransitive paradigm
(which reflects the intransitivity of the verb I'e- 'be' itself), or the
Transitive one (in accordance with the transitivity of the lexical
verb) (Krejnovich 1982:148).
2.9.1.2. Functions. The Periphrastic Prospective expresses rela-
tive immediate future:
 (341) a. p0n joule+rjöt         kude-din I'e-j
          state evening-TRNSF become-sup be-iNTR:3sG
          'It was almost evening.'
        b. el+n'e+ju0-din               l'e-lu-ge   niijie   tat
                [NEG+RECP+see-SUP       be-l/2-DS] mood CA
                gude-l'el
                become-lNFR(3sG)
                'That is how I feel when we are not going to see each
                other.' [F57]
In most cases, the use of this form implies that some preliminary
features of the foregoing event are already present (Krejnovich
1982:148). As a result, this form can be used to refer to a process
in progress, whereby the first stage of the event has already started
(but it is not necessarily the case that it would be brought to its
completion):
 (342) a. letj-d-öl'-i-t                      am-de-din      I'e-iji
                [eat-DETR-DESD-0-SS:IPFV]     die-PFV-SUP    be-3PL:lNTR

       b. num0-ge     jaqa-din  l'e-de-ge    num0-get
          [house-LOC reach-SUP be-3SG-DS] house-ABL
          jaqte-lek   medü-l
          sing-PRED heard-SF
          'When he was approaching the house, he heard a song
          from within.' [Fl3]
Finally, this form can be used to express an intention (Krejnovich
1982:148):
(343) a. carcaqan d'e tet-ul      lectin    I'e-je
         C.         DP you-ACC eat-sup be-iNTR:lSG
         'Charchahan, I am going to eat you.' [F21]
      b. juku+joijzä marqil' min-din     l'e-mle
         small-goose girl     take-SUP be-OF:3SG
         'The small goose is going to marry.' [F5]
2.9.2. The Periphrastic Past2.9.2.1. Formation. The Periphrastic Past is formed by putting
the Subject Nominal form (1.3.5, examples (344)) or the Relative
Nominal form (1.3.7, examples (345)) in the Predicative position.
The former construction is available for intransitive verbs only, the
latter can be used with any verb, cf. (336b) and (336c). According
to the general rules for predicate nominals (see 12.1.1, 12.1.1.3),
this construction requires the copula δ- if the subject is first or
second person; if the subject is third person, the nominal can just
take the Predicative case marker.
2.9.2.2. Functions. The Periphrastic Past is used in order to con-
trast two temporal planes, that is, to highlight that the time of
the situation being described precedes the time of reference; see
(344a), (345a). This function is by no means grammaticalized in
a way normally implied for the category of tense, rather, its usage
is a matter of optional emphasis on the distinction between tem-
poral planes; see (344a), (345a). For example, (344b) is the final
180   Chapter 6. Verb morphologysentence of a story a b o u t some events which had happened in the
speaker's childhood, i.e., long before the story was told (see Text

yet in the last sentence t h e speaker decided to contrastthe time of
the events j u s t described with the time of speech.

          with ropes and let ants eat her.' [F48]
The same construction is used (although very rarely) with a modal
sense:

          you-DAT     NEG-give-O-RES-SBNR-PRED

          'We have to go in the morning.'     (lit. 'we are people
          going away in the morning.')
 2.10. Desiderative
The suffix -51'- expresses the desiderative meaning (Krejnovich
1982:146). Its productivity is hard to assess: it is practically ab-
sent from texts (where this meaning is expressed either by the
Periphrastic Prospective, or more often, by means of the verb
erd'i- 'want' or its derivatives), yet my consultants easily derived
Desiderative forms from various verbs. The suffix seems to belong
to the class of markers which have become obsolete too fast to lose
their productivity. It is particularly common in one, apparently
frozen, combination, leijd-öl'- 'be hungry' (ler/de- 'eat').
(347) a. qäqä,         comön    leij-d-öl'-d'e

          'Friend Tebegej, which way would you prefer to
          die?' [F28]
182    Chapter   6. Verb   morphology3. Aspect
 3.1. Preliminaries
As a first approximation, the morphological means of aspect mark-
ing can be described by the following scheme, which reflects the
linear order of various aspectual suffixes within a verb form:
( 3 4 8 ) [[[ROOT-INTERNAL A S P E C T ] - R E S U L T A T I V E / I N G R E S S I V E ] -
          I M P E R F E C T I V E / H ABITUAL]The basic opposition between Perfective and Imperfective com-
prises two morphological ""layers"": the Internal Aspect marking,
on the one hand, and the regular Imperfective (3.2) and Habitual
(3.4) marking, on the other. The Internal Aspect (see 3.3) com-
prises the Perfective suffix -j- ( 3 . 3 . 1 ) and a set of non-productive
imperfective suffixes. As in many other languages, the Internal
Imperfective is more closely related to the lexical meaning of a
verb and frequently involves various sorts of quantification of situ-
ation which can be subsumed under the term Iterative (a series of
identical subevents within one time interval, on one occasion).30
That is why these suffixes are referred to below as ""Iterative suf-
fixes"" ( 3 . 3 . 2 ) . The Internal Perfective is compatible with the reg-
ular Imperfective suffix, the output also being the iterative sense
(3.2.4).
   Note that the Perfective vs. Imperfective opposition (with the
Iterative as a distinguished subtype of the Imperfective) is also
maintained within the system of the Same-Subject converbs (see
1.4.3, 1.4.4, 1.4.5) which thus constitute the most ""external"" layer
of aspect marking, directly associated with temporal relations be-
tween different situations.","[194, 195, 196, 197, 198, 199, 200]"
"2.1.1. Possessive modifiers
The juxtaposition of NPs can render a possessive relationship (in
a very broad sense) between their referents. The examples below
illustrate the application of this construction to the prototypi-
cal possessive relations: belonging (558), part-whole (559), and
kinship (560), as well as to some other relations that may be
accounted for in terms of extension of the possessive prototype
(561). 41

Note that in (564f) the reading 'the child of that bear' is excluded
only by a wider context: the story is about a woman who gave
birth to a bear. The construction itself does not provide any clues
to the intended interpretation.
   In some cases, the ambiguity of the construction cannot be
resolved by the context, so that an NP allows both the same-
referent (apposition) and the possessive interpretations:

"5.5.2. The Stative form
The copula δ- 'be' (12.1.1.2) has the bound variant +ijδ-, which
can be used to create the Stative form 'be X'. The Stative form
is not very common for genuine Yukaghir nouns (5.5.2.1); yet this
marking appears to play a major role in borrowing of Russian
adjectives (5.5.2.2).

contrast with the Yukaghir qualitative verbs (^.3.2), Russian ad-
jectives are nominal, a fact which is obviously perceived by Yuk-
aghirs (given their native or near-native competence in Russian,
see 2.2). In order to overcome this contradiction, the Stative form
is employed when a Russian adjective is inserted into a Yukaghir

into Yukaghir qualitative verbs:

The Stative form is employed for a new Russian-based modal con-
struction with nado 'is necessary' (see 0.2.7.1, 11.1.2) and consti-
tutes the morphological basis for the Transformative form (5.5.3)5.5.3. The Transformative form
The Transformative form is created by means of the elements -rjö-t
οτ-ηδ-η, which can be morphologically analyzed as the Imperfec-
tive converb of the Stative (as in (242)) and the Stative-based
adverb (see ^.3.3, 4-2) respectively. These variants are used more
or less in the same way, showing at most some tendencies towards
a semantic distribution, rather than a clear semantic distinction.
    Most often, the Transformative is used as an argument of the
verb kude- 'to become, to happen, to begin' (see 12.1.3.1.1). In
this function the two variants of the form are semantically equal
('to become X, to turn into X'), see (244)-(245). The form in -t is
commonly followed by the variant gude- of the verb (see 5.2.1.2)
and (245b)).

 2.8. Reciprocal pattern: V [S, COM]
A group of intransitive verbs signifying situations with two partic-
ipants playing similar roles (so called ""naturally reciprocal events""
(Kemmer 1993:102)) have a secondary slot for a Comitative NP
(see 5.4.2.3):
 (659) a. tat soromo-p-lek         nuij-rjile              titte-n'e
           CA person-PL-PRED meet-OF:3SG                | heir-COM

           'Then they met some people and spoke with

       b. kimm, säl-n'e         kimd'i-k

           'She began to speak with the moon.' [F2]
All such verbs occur with the one-slot valence pattern as well; in
this case, the S slot is conceived of as representing all participants
of the situation:
(660) a. saqal'ä-delle          d'e ann'-ä-rji

ciprocals as well (661), although the one-slot variant is far more
frequent (see 6.4.5.2 for examples):

                Once he met with a very old man living there.' [F31]
Given the general properties of the Comitative strategy of NP
conjunction (8.4.1), there can be no sharp border between the
one-slot and the Comitative valence options. For instance, the
example in (662) apparently represents the Comitative option, yet
the verb agreement is Plural:
 (662)          qahiel-n'e il'ede-rji
                loon-COM         quarrel-3PL:INTR
                'He quarreled with the loon.' [F5]
3. Clausal adjuncts
 3.1. Overview of clausal adjuncts
3.1.1. Spatial and temporal adjuncts
Spatial adjuncts are expressed by means of the local case forms
of NPs (5.4.2.5), by postpositions (7.3.1-7.3.2), by local forms of
demonstratives (7.1.2.1) and by locative adverbs (^.2.2). Tem-
poral adjuncts can be expressed by the Dative case (5.4.2.1), the
Locative case (5.4.2.5.1), the Ablative case (5.4.2.5.2) and by some
postpositions (7.3.2). Nouns denoting periods of time have a spe-
cial Temporal form (5.5.3).
    These adjuncts tend to be clause-initial (663) or, less frequently,
clause-final (663a), (664):

See 11Λ.1-11Λ.2, 13.5.3.1 for a description of spatial and temporal
adverbial clauses.","[379, 380, 381]"
" 3.3. Data for this study and exemplification
This grammar is based on two types of data: authentic texts in
contemporary Kolyma Yukaghir and linguistic interviews with its
native speakers (see Acknowledgments). My text database com-
prises texts published by Irina Nikolaeva in 1989 and texts written
down by Nikolay Vakhtin (1987) and myself (1987, 1992);3 some
of the latter are published in (Maslova 2001), and some are in-
cluded in this grammar (see Appendix 5); in order to increase the
reliability of data, all controversial and/or questionable sentences
of these texts have been double-checked with native speakers. 4
    As discussed in Chapter 2, Kolyma Yukaghir has been under
strong pressure from Russian for at least several decades. This,
in combination with the well-known methodological drawbacks of
interviews, makes this sort of data far less reliable than those
elicited from authentic texts. That is why I tried to use only
text examples for illustrative purposes. As a result, some of these
examples might seem too long and complex for the point they are
intended to illustrate. Unfortunately, it is too often the case that
an authentic sentence ""simplified"" by a linguist for some didactic
purposes is not a reliable example anymore. In the case of such
languages as Yukaghir, the ""unnecessary"" complexity of examples
is the price to be paid for reliability of data. Even if I had a
simpler and, in some sense, ""clearer"" example in my field notes,
I always chose in favor of a text example. 5 In some cases, where
                                                About this grammar   17this seemed to be inevitable, I did ""shorten"" illustrative sentences;
note that all such omissions are shown by <...>; such examples
should not be taken as ""complete sentences"".
    There is, of course, a range of phenomena which cannot be
appropriately described in this fashion because they are absent or
rare in the texts, but are readily produced by my informants in an
interview. These phenomena are described in the grammar on the
basis of my field notes, but with explicit reservations concerning
the source of the data. If an example elicited in an interview
is included in the grammar (in order to avoid loss of significant
information), the source is indicated by the letter ""I"" after the
idiomatic translation.","[34, 35]"
"
4-1• Comitative   strategy
The Comitative strategy represents a sort of intermediate case
between the coordination of NPs (and-like) and the comitative
adjunct (with-like), a situation which seems to be fairly typical for
languages without a separate morpheme for ""and"" (Mithun 1988;
Stassen forthcoming).
    The Comitative marker -n'e (5.4.3.2.1) can be employed to con-
join two (and only two) NPs representing the subject (590) or the
object (591) participants (it is not applied to more marginal par-
ticipants). This construction is also possible with the alternative
Comitative form in -n'it ~ -n'ut; see 5.4.2.3.2 for examples. (590) a. tar] emil-ge   alandin tude adu0-n'e             kereke-pul

            'Since he hated her song, he took his bow and arrows
            and shot at her.' [F37]
The Comitative marking licenses only the single-event ('together')
interpretation of clauses like in (590)-(591), i.e., such a construc-
tion cannot be employed to describe two separate events involving
the conjoined participants in the same role.
    The Comitative either creates a single noun phrase or intro-
duces a new (comitative) participant (see 5.4.2.3.1). Accordingly,
if the Comitative is associated with the subject participant, the
verb agreement can be either Plural (see (590)) or Singular (592)).

            'That girl went away with the moon.' [F2]
        b. met irk-in      pajpe  u0-n'e juode-je
           I    one-ATTR woman child-COM play-iNTR:lPL

          'She did not know where to go and lay down there
          together with the bear.' [F4]
Furthermore, even if the agreement is Plural, the NP created by
means of this strategy is not subject to the Coordinate Structure
Constraint, i.e., the non-Comitative subject participant can be
dropped:
(593) a. met emd'ie-n'e            pon'o-jön-pe
         my younger.sibling-COM remain-SBNR-PL
         δ-d'e
         COP-INTR:lSG
         Ί remained there with my younger sister.'
       b. tar) met pajpe     u0-die-n'e    cu0te

          me+juod-ü'i
          AFF+play-lNTR:lPL
          Ί always played with that girl.'
Note that in the periphrastic verb form in (593a), the nominal form
of the lexical verb bears the Plural marker, while the copula shows
Singular agreement. These observations suggest that there is no
clear border between 'and' and 'with' functions of the Comitative.
    The Comitative marker -n'it (see 5.1.2, 5.4.2.3.2) can be ap-
plied to create a list of two or more NPs, each of which takes the
Comitative marker:

"3.3.2. Iterative suffixes
3.3.2.1. The suffixes which are subsumed here under the term Iter-
ative (Krejnovich 1982:126-134) have a variety of meanings, most
of which have to do with some sort of quantification of situations.
This includes, in particular, distributive and dispersive meanings
(several identical subevents involving different participants and/or
different locations or directions). These suffixes can also render the
same meanings as the Imperfective in -nu-, so that, for example,
an Iterative verb can denote an action in progress (see also 6.3.4.1
on the semantic effect of the regular Imperfective when combined
with an Iterative suffix). Most often, it is not the case that the
semantics of a given suffix can be reduced to one particular mean-
ing (although some tendencies will be noted below). That is why
all these suffixes are glossed as Iterative (ITER), which might not
reflect the meaning implied by a specific example.
    In a number of cases, the Iterative suffixes are opposed to suf-
fixes -de- or -re-, which build up the (semantically) unmarked
                                                             Aspect   193counterparts of the Iterative verbs. It does not seem appropriate
to gloss these suffixes as Perfective, although this might be implied
by the idea of the Internal Aspect opposition: these suffixes do not
signify that sort of bounding the situation which is associated with
the term ""perfective"" in general and with the Yukaghir Perfective
marker in particular. For the purpose of interlinear glossing, I will
use the term non-Iterative for such suffixes (gloss NONIT); thus, if
this abbreviation appears in a gloss, this means that the verb has
an Iterative counterpart (where the given suffix is replaced by an
Iterative one).
   The Iterative suffixes are listed below with some sentences in-
tended to illustrate their meaning, and with some notes on their
distribution. For a representative list of Iterative verbs, see Ap-
pendix 2.
3.3.2.2. The suffix -uj(i)- (Krejnovich 1982:131) takes the form
-ujt- if its second syllable constitutes the final syllable of the word;
if the suffix is followed by a syllabic morph, its final / i / is dropped
or reduced. This suffix produces the / j / ~ / c / alternation in / j / -
initial morphs (see 5.3.3.3.2).
    This suffix signifies that the situation is viewed as a protracted
process, in most cases, consisting of a series of identical sub-
situations (a multiplicative situation); it combines only with in-
transitive verbs (with few exceptions). Most of the authentic text
instances of such verbs are Imperfective or Iterative converbs (see
1.4.3, 1.4.5). In each pair of examples below, (b) contains a verb
marked for Iterative, (a), its unmarked counterpart.

           [wander-lTER-SS:ITER] walk-3PL:lNTR
           'They lead a nomadic life.'
In some cases, the derivative with -uji- is opposed to the Perfective
derivative with -j, while the unmarked counterpart may be absent,
e.g., kewe-j- 'to leave, to go away' vs. kew-uji- 'to be in the process
of leaving, to go away and come back several times, without being
able to leave after all'.
3.3.2.3. The suffix -(u)zu- is attached to a very restricted set of
verbs and signifies the dispersive meaning (movement in various
directions, location at various places):
(369) a. tamun ti+tä          üj-de          soromo-pul-ge
         [that    here+there work-SS:lTER] person-PL-LOC

           'The blood from the shoeless feet of her running
           children lay on the reindeer moss here and there,
           turning it red.' [F7]
Practically in all instances, there is no morphologically unmarked
stem. The Dispersive suffix is opposed to the suffix -re-, cf. sej-re-
vs. seg-uzu- 'run away'; jie-re- vs. jie-zu- 'swim'; ej-re- vs. eg-uzu-
'walk'. In one single case, the suffix seems to confer a reciprocal
meaning: jug-uzu- 'kiss each other' (from jugi- 'kiss').
3.3.2.4. The suffix -ci- (Krejnovich 1982:126-127) is used with a
closed class of verbs, mostly transitive, and most often has the
distributive meaning (action upon several distinct objects).
(370) a. terike, mit u0r-pe               kude-s't-ge
           wife    our child-PL kill-lTER-lMP(lPL)

           take.away-lTER-iNFR-0-TR:3SG
           'He took away all those things of his.' [F31]
This suffix can also express progressive (371a) and iterative (371b-
371c).
(371) a.    me+am-δϊ
           AFF+die-ITER(3SG)

           'He was repeating this and running around.' [F56]
        c. cu0te       adä-t        mer-uji-t               tude nojl
           [always there-ABL            fly-ITER-SS:lPFv]   his   leg

            'When he jumps from there, he always injures his leg,
            making it ache.' [I]
Almost all the derivatives with this suffix are opposed to the verbs
with the suffix -de-, which thus form semantically unmarked coun-
terparts of such verbs, cf. am-de- vs. am-ci- 'die', kude-de- vs.
kude-ci- 'kill', etc. In some cases, the basic (morphologically un-
marked) stem also exists and represents the non-Causative coun-
terpart of the derived verbs; see 4.3.3.5.
3.3.2.5. The suffix -jt- (Krejnovich 1982:126) is used with a very
small group of transitive verbs (see Appendix 2), with the itera-
tive/imperfective meaning, cf. the following examples:
(372) a. tat       qorobo äj       kigi-m
            CA cow          CP jab-TR:3SG
            'Then the cow jabbed (him) once again.' [F27]

"1.4.4. The Indefinite pronoun sär 'something'
The Indefinite pronoun sär means either 'something' (more rarely,
'somebody') (473), or, if used as a modifier, 'some (of), any' (474).

The Indefinite pronoun tie 'some' can be used either as a modi-
fier (475) or as an independent noun phrase (476). In the latter
function, it has a meaning like 'some of them' or 'others' (in this
case, it often contrasts with a previously introduced noun phrase
containing the same pronoun as a modifier; see (477)). If used as a
254   Chapter    7. Morphology   of closed   classesnoun phrase, the pronoun takes the nominal inflection and occurs
most often in the Plural form.

The pronoun has the adverbial form tlemede 'sometimes':
                                                               Pronouns   255(478)     üe-mede    tar/ pulut      n'ied'i-nnu-l'el

The substantivized form of this pronoun is derived by means of
the suffix -ben (see 1.2.3):
(480) a. met tet-in         jen-bed-ek                kej-te-me

          'You will go from me to other people.' [F31]
This pronoun can be used in combination with the Ablative NP
to render a meaning like 'else than, but':

1.5. Universal quantifiers
1.5.1. The universal pronoun cumu(t) 'all, whole, everything'
This universal pronoun has two forms, cumut and cumu. Basically,
the first form is used for quantification of primary participants
(483), the second, otherwise (484) (Krejnovich 1982:262-263).
                                                               Pronouns   257(483) a. äumut        terike-l-l'el-rji

          'He made presents and gave them to all of them.' [F3]
The universal quantifier cannot function as a noun modifier. It
either serves as an autonomous pronoun, with the meaning 'ev-
erybody' or 'everything' (485), or is combined with the quantified
noun phrase within one clause, thus forming a construction similar
to quantifier floating (486).

                'For the animals and for the human beings, he made
                everything he was told to make.' [F3]
The form cumu can render the meaning 'whole':
 (487)          tintaij kenme-gi        soj-1-ö-d'e       pejd'e
                that    partner-POSS [fry-O-RES-ATTR] armpit

                'His partner took the fried shoulder blade and ate it
                whole.' [F42]
There is a new compound involving the component ciste ~ cirte,
from Russian cisto 'clean', colloquial 'entirely'. The resulting com-
bination ciste+cumu has roughly the same meaning as just cumu,
yet somewhat intensified. The compound can take case markers.

This quantifier has the meaning 'every, various, any, every variety
(of)'; a noun phrase containing this quantifier is often accompanied
by the universal pronoun cumu(t):

the suffix -ben (see 1.2.3); it is used in the meaning 'everything,
lots of various things':

Note that postpositional phrases, NPs in oblique cases and adverbs
cannot serve as modifiers in Kolyma Yukaghir, with a few minor
exceptions. 38 To some extent, their potential semantic functions
are taken over by unmarked modifiers, which cover a fairly wide
range of semantic relationships (see (561), (562)). On the other
hand, an ""oblique"" modifier can be introduced by means of a rela-
tive clause, most notably, by an existential (545a) or a Proprietive
(545b) relative clause.

            'We will give him all the animals that are walking in
            the water now.' [F9]
A possible exception is Dative modifiers, which are attested in a
few examples in my corpus. Such a modifier can both precede
and follow the head noun. Presumably, this is a new construction
which has arisen due to the influence of Russian. Some examples:
 (546) a. oqil'l'ä and'e-lek        anil-pe-yin
          Perch leader-PRED fish-PL-DAT
          'Perch is a prince of (to) fishes.' [F10]

            snare-PRED install-OF:3SG
            'Outside, near his house, he installed a snare for
            hares.' [F15]
Note, however, that the same semantic relationships between NPs
can be rendered by the regular unmarked or Attributive modifier
(see 2.1, 2.3).
   Besides, the substantivized pronouns jen+ben 'other (than)'
and irkil+l'e 'one (of)' can take the Ablative modifier (see 7.1.4.6,
7.2.1.1).","[302, 303, 304]"
"1.1.1. Clauses with nominal predicates in the Predicative form
The nominal predicate in the Predicative case occurs only with the
third-person subject (761); otherwise, the copular pattern must be
used (see 1.1.2):
 (761) a. comölben     lebie-n+end'öd-ek
          elk         earth-ATTR+animal-PRED
          'The elk is a land animal.' [F34]
       b. momusä laqidis'e ciste        cumu amun-ek
          M.        tail      entirely all   bone-PRED
          'The whole tail of Momusha is only bones.' [F6]
438   Chapter 12. Nominal predicates and grammatical   Focus        c. titt-in     cumu tudel id'i    pugil'-ek
           they-DAT all      he     now lord-PRED
           'To all of them, he is now the lord.' [F9]
        d. til) marqil' met emd'e
           this girl      my younger.sibling
           'This girl is my younger sister.'
The subject of a descriptive clause can be easily omitted, so that
a clause is made up of a single NP in the Predicative case:
 (762) a. irk-in     soromo ejre-j            jöbt

           'Near Taskan there were Evens. (These were) two
           families of Evens.' [F55]
1.1.2. Copular descriptive clauses
The copular pattern is the only option if the subject of a descrip-
tive clause is first or second person:
                                          Clauses with nominal predicates   439(763) a. met vasilej-die       ö-d'e

          'My name is Basil.'

          you be.terrible-ATTR be.ill-ANR C O P - I N T R : 2 S G
          'You are a terrible disease!' [F47]
The bound copula form +ηδ- can also be used in this construction,
although such examples are less common; see (764). Somewhat
unexpectedly, the bound variant, in contrast to the free variant,
allows Plural and Possessive marking on the noun: 88
(764) a. mit       kereke-pul+ijö-d'üi
          we      Koryak-PL+COP-lNTR:lPL
          'We are the Koryaks (you are looking for).' [F50]
       b. met alandin        üjs'i-gi+rjö-d'e
          I       A.        worker-POSS+COP-lNTR:lSG

       c. kin+r/ö-k?

          'Who are you?' [F50]
       d. er-ce                pugil'+r/d-l'el-d'ek

          'You turned out to be a bad son-in-law.' [F18]
With the third-person subject, the copular pattern is used if some
modal meaning has to be expressed (765), in non-finite descriptive
clauses (766) and in negative clauses (767a):
440   Chapter 12. Nominal predicates and grammatical Focus

            'If Petr Berbekin is a sinner, he will burn in fire
            . . . ' [F31]
The negative prefix is attached to the free copula (767a)-(767b)
or to the noun followed by the bound copula (767c) (Krejnovich
1982:193-194)):
 (767) a. comparnä            el+δ

          I      NEG+T.+COP-INTR:lSG
          Ί am not Tebegej.' [F28]
The subject of a copular clause can be omitted if its referent is
recoverable; see (767a)-(767b) and (768).
(768)   a. 0rd'-5-l          lebie-ge   ejre-t

          'They were such lazy people.' [F53]
The copula 5- has the transitive counterpart ο-ζΐ-, which has a
slot for Nominative NP that qualifies the Ο participant from the
point of view of the A participant:
(769)     mit id't       tit-ul soromo
          we now you(PL)-ACC person
          el+ö-zi-t-ti'i
          NEG+COP-CAUS-FUT-INTR:lPL
          'From now on we will not consider you human beings
          (you will not be human beings to us).' [K4]
1.1.3. Headless relative clauses as nominal predicates
Headless relative clauses (see 11.3.3) can be used as nominal pred-
icates, both with the copula δ- (770) and in the Predicative form
(771)-(772). In this construction, the subject of a descriptive
clause is identified with (or described as) the relativized partic-
ipant.
   If the relativized participant is the subject, the subject of the
matrix clause is identified with the subject of the relative clause.
Thus, the whole construction has a single subject NP which is de-
442   Chapter    12. Nominal predicates   and grammatical   Focusscribed as the primary participant of the relative clause situation.
The resulting structure is similar to that of a simple clause, the
only difference being the ""complex"" form of the verb; see (770)-
(771). As described in 6.2.9.2.2, such constructions function as
the Periphrastic Past. Note that in such a construction the neg-
ative marker is attached to the lexical verb, not to the copula
(771b)-(771c).
 (770) a. met 0rd'5-l                         lebie-ge          Ve-j-ben
            I           [be.middle-ANR e a r t h - L O C       be-ATTR-RELNR]

            [almost    [eat-DETR-DESIR-O-SS: IPF v]
            el+amde-j-ben-pe          δ-ά'ϊΐ'ϊ
            NEG+die-ATTR-SBNR-PL]                    COP-INTR:lPL
                'We have almost died from hunger.'
 (771) a. magadan-ge ataq-un                      n'emolhil-ge l'e-lle           tat
                [M.-LOC          two-ATTR year-LOC                  be-SS:PFv]   CA
                kie-s'uod-ek
            come-SBNR-PRED
            'He has come after having spent two years in
            Magadan.'
        b. sorjd'il'e kieje met-ket   kewe-öuon-pe-lek
           flood      before we-ABL go-PFV:SBNR-PL-PRED
           'They had gone away from me before the flood.'
If the relativized participant is the direct object, the subject of the
matrix clause is identified with the Ο participant of the relative
clause situation. Thus, the Ο participant is represented by the
subject NP (this constituent is shown in boldface in (772)). This
structure clearly distinguishes such constructions from their simple
                                       Clauses with nominal   predicates   443transitive counterparts:
(772)      adu0n soromo kimdan'e-ri-din        tetcie-pe
           this      [person deceive-APPL-SUP rich.person-PL
           ä-ijile-bed-ek
           make-3PL:ATTR-RELNR-PRED]
           'This is a thing the rich did in order to deceive
           people.'
However, the substantivized Passive Attributive forms (such as
those in (772)) can be also involved in the Periphrastic past forms,
which entails reanalysis of the construction as a simple clause,
hence, the Accusative marking of the Ο constituent (see examples
in £.2.9.2.2). 891.1.4. Result Nominal clauses as nominal predicates
The Result Nominal clause (0.1.3.4) can function as a nominal
predicate of a descriptive clause. This construction describes some
observed state of affairs as a result of a prior situation. The subject
of such a descriptive clause is either represented by the pronoun
tabun or dropped.
(773) a. tabun porjzube          lukil  ejü-l-5-gi
         that     [wood-grouse arrow get-0-RNR-POSS]

           'Peter Berbekin checked his ropes. They had been
           fastened well.' [F31]
        c. tabun k0ze ejre-t             lorjd-5-gi         tude
           that    [[K. walk-SS:lPFv] dance-RNR-POSS his

           'It was Koje who walked and danced there in his
           shoes.' (lit. 'That is the result of Koje having walked
444   Chapter 12. Nominal predicates and grammatical   Focus            and danced in his shoes.') [F8]
        d. met-kele met es'ie jad-5-gi <...>
           [I-ACC     my father Send-RNR-Poss]
           'It was my father who had sent me . . . ' (lit. '(My being
           here) is a result of my father s having sent me.') [F22]
This construction can be employed to signify that the primary
participant of the Result Nominal situation is a part of the asser-
tion; see, e.g., (773c)-(773d).90 This use is motivated by the fact
that the A participant constitutes an element of the preceding sit-
uation, but not of the resulting state. For example, the sentence
in (773d) is intended to explain why the speaker is in some place
(the resulting state of affairs which does not involve the cause),
and this explanation invokes a preceding transitive situation with
its A participant.","[455, 456, 457, 458, 459, 460, 461, 462]"
"3.2. Functions of the Plural
3.2.1. Plurality
The Plural form signifies multiplicity of the entities referred to:
 (146) a. met tl     l'e-l    soromo-pul-rjin    kie-s'e
          I    [here be-ANR] person-PL-DAT come-lNTR:lSG

                                     Functions   of the Number forms   85        b. cohojo-pul n'umud'i-pe    qod+ä-met?
           knife-PL   ax-PL        how-make-TR:2PL
           'What have you done to the knives and the axes?' [F55]
Very rarely, the Plural can be used after a numeral, or when the
multiplicity is signified by the verb ninge- 'be many' (see 3.1.4,
3.1.5):
(147) a. <...> purk-in         cül'd'i    pulut-pe-lek

           children-PL-POSS-ATTR child-PL many-LNTR:3PL
           'He has a lot of grandchildren.' [K4]
The Plural form of a noun signifying a pair of entities marks mul-
tiplicity of pairs.

          your (PL) shoe-PL get.dry-CAUS-PL-LMP:2

tive, and indefinite pronouns.

In the context of a Possessive marker, the Plural marker can sig-
nify either the plurality of the entities referred to by the noun
itself, or the plurality of the entities cross-referenced by the pos-
sessive marker, or both, so that a Possessive Plural form has three
readings, e.g., the form num0-pe-gi can mean 'his houses', 'their
house', or 'their houses'. Some examples:

Note that in these examples the ambiguity of the Possessive forms
is resolved by means of the verb agreement markers; cf. the Sin-
gular different-subject form in (150a) and the Plural finite form in
(150b).
    In the Action Nominal (151a) and in the Result Nominal (151b)
form of verbs, the Plural marker signifies the plurality of the sub-
ject. In most cases, such forms involve a Possessive marker cross-
referencing the subject, yet the Plural marking is also occasionally
possible in the absence of a possessive marker (151c).
