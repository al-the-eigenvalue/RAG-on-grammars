traditionally employed in descriptions of Indo-European case systems
(e.g. Latin, Russian) have only recently become accepted by
Australianists since the important papers by Mel'cuk (1979) and Goddard
(1982). To quote Goddard's formulation (p. 169), ""a case is a class of
                                                      The Yukulta Case System         559
nominal forms which are mutually substitutable in certain syntactic or
semantic environments given that for any two cases, casej and casej are
formally distinguished by at least one subclass of nominal"" (italics mine).
    On my analysis all nominals in apposition and all nominals that are
mutually substitutable, have the same case. In (10-53), for example, the
phrase ngalawanji burldamurri ('we three (OBJect)') is glossed as
containing two words, each in the LOCative; Keen glosses the pronoun
'OBJective' and the nominal 'ERGative/LOCative'. Similarly, the phrase
kirrwa kunawunantha 'for you two children' is parsed by my analysis
into two dative words; Keen's analysis glosses the nominal 'DATive' and
the pronoun 'BENefactive'.
    A second difference is that I treat the PROPrietive (Keen's COMitative)
as a case rather than a derivational suffix. This is a possibility Keen
considers but does not adopt. There are two reasons for this: it may mark
objects in detransitivized case frames, and it marks the subcategorized
arguments of certain verbs (as in K). Both features are more
characteristic of cases than derivational suffixes. Also relevant here are
the arguments given in 3.4.2 against considering as derivational those
suffixes that include an adnominal function, simply because they may be
followed by a further suffix.
    Finally, note that Yukulta nominals have a truly ergative/absolutive,
rather than a ""tripartite"" system (with distinct A, S and Ο cases), since no
nominal subclass formally distinguishes S from O.1
    This is the appropriate point to mention another deviation between my
glosses and Keen's: in the interests of presenting the complex Yukulta
facts, I use slightly more transparent labels than in her grammar for the
tense/mood categories of the auxiliary. For example, in (10-53) I gloss
the auxiliary as 'PST.IRR' rather than her 'FUT' ; this is justified by her
own analysis (Keen 1983: 223).","[585, 586]"
"Keen (1983: 246) treats condition (c) as a type of concord: ""the
complement is marked by a dative case which agrees with an unfilled
dative NP in Sj"". This explanation is attractive. But to establish it
satisfactorily we would need sentence examples in which the dative
marks main clause NPs destined to become future pivots, and
unfortunately Keen gives no examples of this. 16 Without them, it is
better to treat this construction as a special case of ""obviation"",
supplementing the antecedent-agreement system.
    There are thus two exceptions to the antecedent-agreement principle
governing complementizing case: the complementizing DATive can appear
16
    Despite this lack, her explanation gains cross linguistic support from some
Warlpiri data reported by Hale (1982a: 296-7), showing ""pure obviative complements""
which take subjects in the dative:
             kurdu-ngku    ka       jarntu     warru-wajilipi-nyi,    [kamta-ku        miyi
             child-ERG     PRES     dog        around-chase-NPST      woman-DAT       food

             cook-INFIN-OBVIATIVE
             'The child is chasing the dog around, while the woman is cooking food.'
But it is possible to ""foreground"" the infinitival subject by raising it into the main
clause, still marked dative. The subordinate infinitival complement then optionally
agrees with it in case:
     kurdu-ngku     ka-rla            jarntu     warru-wajilipi-nyi     karnta-ku,
     child-ERG      PRES-3sgIOBJ      dog        around-chase-NPST      woman-DAT

546     12 Finite subordinate clauses
when the antecedent is a LOCative underlying object, or where no
antecedent exists at all.17
1 2 . 6 . 2 Evolution of the Kayardild Odd Pivot system
It is likely that pT—or at least proto southern Tangkic—had a system
essentially identical to the Yukulta one just described. At some later
stage, the case marking strategy for main clauses shifted from an ergative
to an accusative system (10.4.2.2) with objects coming to take the
LOCative in the commonest construction type. As the pT form {-kiya}
lost its ergative function, the affiliations of the old complementizing
ergative would no longer have been clear, and it was almost completely
reanalysed as a LOCative, with which it was formally identical. The only
residue of its original ergative status is the ban on C.LOC appearing on
pronouns: this goes back to the fact that the ergative form of proto-
Tangkic pronouns was identical with the absolutive (later nominative), so
that the synchronically aberrant invarient subject pronouns merely
continue the old ergative form (cf. 12.1.4.1).
     If the rules for assigning complementizing case remained
unchanged—and this is quite plausible, given the relative conservatism of
subordinate clause constructions (cf. Givon 1979: 89)—we would obtain
the schema illustrated in Table 12-1 (OBV represents the case where the
subordinate subject has no antecedent).
     Almost the entire complementizing system in stage 1 follows from the
single principle of case agreement—the ""obviative dative"" and the use of
the complementizing dative where the antecedent is an object remarked
with the LOCative are two minor supplementary principles. By contrast,
that at stage 2 lacks any obvious rationale, and would have to be learnt as
a collection of unmotivated rules. Clearly the pressure to somehow
refashion it would be great. One simple way would be to reinstate a
modified agreement rule: if the antecedent is nominative (A or S), don't
mark the subordinate clause, otherwise mark it. Assuming further that
speakers were aware of two alternate markers (*LOC and *DAT) but were
unsure how to use them, we may postulate a stage in which all
subordinate clauses with non-subject antecedents could take either. At
this stage we essentially have a switch reference system, which marks
17
    It is not uncommon for systems of antecedent-agreement to employ as
complementizers only a subset of the available (relational) case inflections, resulting
in exceptions to the agreement principle. In Martuthunira (Dench 1988) ""Finite
Relative Clauses"" can be complementized with the Accusative or the Locative, marked
on the verb. While the Accusative is used only with accusative antecedents, the
Locative covers Genitive as well as Locative antecedents.

identity (unmarked) or non-identity (marked) between matrix and
subordinate subjects.
    Still later, in modern Kayardild, the choice between LOCative and
OBLique (ex DATive) cases was reanalysed and aligned with the person of
the subject, with LOCative used wherever the subject includes a second
person referent (12.1.4).
    How this happened remains a mystery. One possibility is that the

modern Kayardild (9.2.4.1); they are not shown here.","[572, 573, 574]"
"(B) MEANING. The transparency of the semantic relation between ""modal""
and ""relational"" or ""adnominal"" meanings varies with the case
considered. The relationship between ablative and ""past"", and allative and
""inceptive"", is one of straightforward transfer from the spatial to the
temporal or aspectual planes. But the relationship between proprietive or
""having"" and potential modality requires more subtle analysis of the
relational and adnominal meanings of the Kayardild proprietive, which
include ""intentional object"" and ""potential ability"" (4.3.5). In the case of
the OBLique, whose modal value is ""emotive"", it has virtually been
leached of a clear semantic value in its relational use. I consider the nature
of these semantic relationships in more detail in 10.2.
    This range, from semantically transparent polysemy to functional
ranges with a less clear semantic basis, is typical of case systems in many
languages—just consider the genitive with objects of negated verbs in
Polish or Russian, and the effects of discourse factors on case-marking
(Hopper—Thompson 1980) in a large number of languages. Cases that
include information about tense are found in other Australian languages
(e.g. Kalkatungu, Pitta-Pitta and of course Yukulta and Lardil) and also
in the Caucasus (e.g. Georgian—see Vogt 1971 and Harris 1981).
Although some semantic link may be uncovered by careful analysis (e.g.
Wierzbicka's (1980) study of the Russian instrumental), the case systems
of most languages abound in such problematic polysemy.
    The radical difference between Kayardild and these other languages is
that in Kayardild each semantic or syntactic component is factored out, as
it were, and represented in a separate level of case-marking, whereas in
most languages a number of factors combine to select a single case (see
                                  3.4 Functional domains of case inflection   119
Austin 1981b for some Australian examples). To consider a single
example: in many languages, objects of nominalized verbs receive an
oblique case instead of the regular object case (cf. Silverstein 1981). That
is, two syntactic factors—object relation, and nominalized verb—
combine to select a single case (usually the dative or genitive). In
Kayardild, on the other hand, each is represented by a distinct case
inflection: the object relation by the appropriate modal case, and the fact
that the verb is nominalized by the associating OBLique.
(C) SEQUENCE RESTRICTIONS. Certain sequences of case-suffixes are not
permitted in Κ (4.2.3): the OBLique may not be followed by another case,
and the LOCative may only be ""followed"" by the OBLique, in which case
the suppletive portmanteau -(k)urrka is used. A number of strategies may
be used when such restrictions are encountered. For example, the inner
suffix may be replaced by a near synonym that does not violate the
restriction, or it may disappear entirely. What is relevant here is that these
sequence constraints apply regardless of suffix function (although the
choice of a synonymous substitute does depend on their function, as one
would expect). Our morphological statements are therefore simplified if
we assume that the same suffix is involved.
    In this grammar I adopt a polysemy analysis, treating the various case
functions as functional or contextual variants of single cases. This has the
advantage of emphasising the strikingly case-like syntactic properties (in
particular, concord) found with all functions of these suffixes, of
drawing attention to the semantic connections between case and modality,
of accounting for the identical sequence restrictions that these suffixes
obey regardless of their function, and of being faithful to their historical
origins: as I will show in 10.4 and 12.6, all these morphemes originated
as case suffixes sensu strictu, regardless of their synchronic status.
    At the same time, I will make the determining role of syntactic context
explicit by treating case suffixes as bipartite entities, identified by a case
label (e.g. ABLative) and a function (e.g. Modal). This makes it possible
to formulate generalizations either in terms of function, or in terms
of ""case"".","[145, 146]"
"3 . 1 . 1 . 1 The nominal class. Several subclasses must be
distinguished within the nominal class.
     As in many Australian languages, there is a large open class of
NOUN/ADJECTIVES, with identical inflectional and derivational
possibilities. Typically, members of this class have several functional
possibilities within the NP: wurkara, for example, may designate an
entity, 'boy', or may be an adjective-like qualifier, 'male'. Jambarnda
may mean 'hollow' (attribute) or 'hollow log' (entity). Warngiida may
function as a quantifier, meaning 'one', as a qualifier, meaning
'common, shared', or as a determiner, meaning 'a, a certain'. The
various possibilities for noun/adjectives are discussed in 6.3.
Noun/adjectives may also function as nominal predicates in verbless
clauses (9.1) and as ""second predicates"" (9.4), as in 'you will return
home a good fisherman'.
     PRONOUNS form a closed class. They distinguish person (1st, 2nd,
1st + 2nd or 1st inclusive, and 3rd) and number (singular, dual and
plural). The pronominal case system is basically identical to that of other
nominals; minor differences are discussed in 5.2.2.
     LOCATIONALS are another closed class. They are inherently locative
and do not normally inflect for the LOCative case. A number of special
derivational suffixes are found only with this class. Locationals may be
86     3 Some descriptive   preliminaries
 further subclassified into the DISTANCE LOCATIONALS dan-da 'this,
 here' and dathina 'that, there', the COMPASS LOCATIONALS, and
 POSmONALS like marrwaa 'near' and dulkalarri 'outside'.
      All locationals may function as local adjuncts. In addition,
 demonstrative and compass locationals may function as spatial
 determiners, as in danda dangkaa 'this man' and bada dangkaa '(the)
 west man'. The demonstrative dathina 'that' doubles as a discourse
 determiner. And compass locationals and positionals occur in complex
 NPs giving the relative location of two entities.
      MANNER NOMINALS describe the manner in which an actor
 accomplishes some action, e.g. kantharrkuru              'alone, unaided',
junkuyarrada 'in return, in revenge'. Whereas normal noun/adjectives
 may function as heads, modifiers, nominal predicates or second
 predicates, manner nominals may only function as second predicates on
 semantic actors. This limits their case possibilities to the nominative, or,
 with verbs taking object complements (e.g. Ί saw / found / left him
 sitting alone'), to a case appropriate to objects.
      PREDICATE NOMINALS have nominal form and nominal derivational
 possibilities, but can only function as predicators: they cannot be used
 attributively, or inflect for case. Typical examples are mibulka 'asleep'
 and mungurru 'knowing, knowledgeable'. Some, such as mungurru,
 may take quasi direct objects 'knowing OBJ'; and some take quasi indirect
 objects, e.g. mulurra 'jealous, suspicious (of IOBJ)'.
      ΉΜΕ NOMINALS give temporal specification. They too take only a
subset of nominal case inflections: see 5.4.2.
      INTERROGATIVES belong to a functional class cross-cutting the
morphological        classification given above: there are interrogative
pronouns, locationals and verbs. Interrogatives are discussed with the
syntax of questions, in 9.5.","[112, 113]"
"
3 . 1 . 2 Lexical and phrasal classes; category mismatches
For each of the two major word classes, nominals and verbals, it is
useful to set up corresponding phrasal units:
    NOUN PHRASES (NPs) consist of one or more nominal words,
agreeing in case (3.4.2.1), whose order is largely determined by
syntactic function (6.2.1); they are discussed in Chapter 6 1 .
    VERB COMPLEXES ( V C s ) comprise one or more verbal words,
agreeing in ""final inflection"", whose order is determined by function
(8.2); they are discussed in Chapter 82.
    The syntactic behaviour of elements within NPs and VCs can be used
to define categories of ""syntactic nouns"" and ""syntactic verbs""
independently of their morphological characteristics. Syntactic nouns
govern relational and/or adnominal case agreement, and may be modified
by demonstratives, adjectives, quantifiers, adnominal NPs. Syntactic1
     Note that case agreement is a necessary but not sufficient condition for shared
membership of a NP: second predicates may agree in case with another NP but do not
form a constituent with it.
2
     Although the term ""verb phrase"" would reflect better the isomorphic relation
between nouns and noun phrases, on the one hand, and verbs and verb complexes, on
the other, it has been used so often with the meaning of ""predicate"" or ""verb plus non-
subject arguments"" that this would be confusing. I therefore use Dixon's (1977) term
""verb complex"". In the X-bar theory of phrase structure, it corresponds to a V'.
 88     3 Some descriptive   preliminaries
verbs govern agreement in tense, aspect, mood and polarity within the
VC, and may be modified by aspectual, motional or adverbial coverbs.
    Kayardild grammar sanctions a number of mismatches between
categories belonging to different components of the grammar—
morphological, syntactic, and semantic—and in the rest of this section I
show how this can happen, what mismatches occur, and propose a
precise descriptive terminology.
    One main source of such mismatches is a class of inflections that
change the word-class membership of their constituents, so that there is a
mismatch between the syntactic and morphological categories of fully
inflected words: morphological verbs may be syntactic nouns, and
morphological nouns may be syntactic verbs. I illustrate these in 3.1.2.2,
after first spelling out, in 3.1.2.1, language-specific tests that
successfully distinguish inflectional from derivational morphology. A
second source of mismatches is the existence of constructions with non-
verbal predicates, some of which are two-place; these are discussed in
3.1.2.3.","[114, 115]"
"3 . 1 . 2 . 3 Mismatches between morphological, syntactic, and
semantic categories. The existence of inflections that change word
class produces a lack of exact fit between morphological and syntactic
word class. Even though the unmarked situation is for NPs to be made up
of words that belong to the nominal category on both morphological and
syntactic criteria, and VCs to be made up of words that are verbal on both
morphological and syntactic criteria, we can have NPs made up of
syntactic nouns that are morphologically verbal and VCs made up of
syntactic verbs that are morphologically nominal:

    On the use of warraja and wirdija in verbal complexes see 8.2. Here warraja
contributes the meaning 'going around' and wirdija the meaning 'keep doing X'.

In addition, the basic tendency of languages to employ verbs as
predicates and nominals as arguments is not strictly adhered to, for
Kayardild shares with many other Australian languages the possibility of
using nominal words or NPs as predicates in ""nominal sentences"". There
is even a small set of nominals, mostly referring to states, that may be
described as ""transitive"" or ""semi-transitive"": the noun/adjectives
mungurru 'know, knowing' and burdumbanyi 'ignorant', for example,
take quasi direct objects, and mulurra 'jealous' takes a quasi indirect
object (9.1.7). However, it is not possible for verbals to act as arguments
without undergoing some derivational process. This gives us the
following picture:
   Semantic                    Word-class category (phrasal category)
   function                                 nominal (NP)           verbal (VC)   argument   predicate
Proposals as to how to handle categorial mismatches have been made by
Sadock's (1991) theory of autolexical syntax; in a formal grammar of
Kayardild such mismatches could be stipulated in the lexical entry of the
category-changing inflectional suffix, stating the morphological and
syntactic categories they assign to their host. What is important for the
purposes of this reference grammar is that a terminological distinction be
maintained, where needed, between logical function (argument,
predicator), phrasal category (NP, VC) and word class as defined by
morphology (e.g. ""morphological noun"") and by syntax (e.g. ""syntactic
noun"").
    92        3 Descriptive   preliminaries
3.2 Word order and ellipsis3.2.1          Word      orderThe order of phrases in Kayardild is basically free, with all orders
attested. Case marking, not word order, codes syntactic relations.
    Discussion of word order is rendered both difficult and unimportant
by the frequent ellipsis of arguments, which leaves some clauses with
nothing but verbs. On the other hand, phrases may be repeated within the
one sentence, either as afterthoughts or for emphasis, and it is not always
clear which NP to use in deciding constituent order.
    Below I give word order counts taken from seven narrative texts
(including six given in Part II); repetitions and subordinate clauses were
ignored in the count. Ellipsed arguments are given in brackets, arbitrarily
placed before non-ellipsed ones.","[117, 118, 119]"
"1 0 . 3 . 2 . 1 Types of instrument. Perhaps the most subtle
investigation of the semantics of the instrumental case is that given in
Wierzbicka (1980). Her explications of the Russian instrumental include
both a ""subject component"" (""SUBJ did something"") and a contact
component (""INSTR came into contact with OBJ""). Different languages
take different components as paramount, leading to different patterns of

case syncretism. Ergative/instrumental syncretism, as in Dyirbal (Dixon
1972), stresses the subject component. Locative/instrumental syncretism,
as in Warluwarra (Breen 1971), stresses the contact component. In yet
other languages the instrument function may simply be inferred from the
presence of a second predicate of having, as with the Yukulta examples
discussed above; in ergative languages with this construction the having
suffix is followed by ergative agreement 10
    Κ allows a number of possibilities.
    INSTRUMENT OF EQUIPMENT. When the instrument is borrowed or
temporarily snatched up for the task at hand, the Associative is used.
This functions as a second predicate on the subject, with the reading ""X
V-ed, temporarily having ASSOC"" (implied: ""and using it""). Like all other
second predicates on the subject, the Associative NP escapes both AOBL
(9-177) and modal case (10-28):

            3pl-du-NOM catch-PST fish-MABL net-ASSOC
            'They caught some fish with the net.' (temporarily using it)Where the subject is using a body part as instrument, the NOMinative is
most commonly used (9.4.3), although PROP is also possible (10-29);
such NPs escape modal case.

"The importance of ordering to the interpretation of NPs is illustrated by the
semantic difference between ngijinda nida wuranda 'my totem animal' (lit.
'my name food') and ngijinda wuranda nida 'my totem name'; in the first
nida functions as a qualifier, while in the second the qualifier is wuranda.

morphological subclasses proposed in 3.1. The determiner function, for
example, may be discharged by possessive pronouns, demonstratives
and compass locationals, genitive and ablative noun phrases expressing
possession, and certain noun/adjectives like niida 'same' and jathaa
'different'. This places the burden of characterizing the NP on functions
like determiner, qualifier, etc., rather than on formally-based phrasal
categories like Determiner Phrase, Adjectival Phrase and so on.
   Variation in the order of modifiers causes changes in their function.
Possessive pronouns, for example, function as definite determiners
when they precede the number nominal, but are indefinite qualifiers
when they follow it: niwanda kiyarrngka thabuju 'his two brothers' vs
kiyarrngka niwanda thabuju 'two (of) his elder brothers'.

   Figure 6-1 shows the various types of multifunctional lexemes.
238    6 The noun phrase    The polyfunctionality of Κ lexemes is systematic rather than random:
only the above ten functional combinations are attested out of a
theoretically possible 5! = 120.
    Many lexemes, for example, double as entities and qualifiers, e.g.
maku 'woman; female', jambarnda 'hollow log; hollow', balumbanda
 'westerner; western'. And many double as entity and generics, e.g.
thungalda 'tree; thing', dangkaa 'man; human being'. There are also
about 100 that can only function as qualifiers, e.g. jungarra 'big' and
others discussed in 6.3.3, and a half dozen that can only function as
numbers, such as kiyarrngka 'two'. But there are no lexemes that double
as determiners and generics, or qualifiers and generics, for example.
    There are clear semantic reasons for these restrictions and multiple
possibilities. The absence of lexemes that can be both determiners and
generics is due to the inherent unsuitability of generic terms, which
denote a large class of entities, for identifying individuals, which is the
semantic function of determiners.
    Given the strict restrictions on polyfunctionality, and the semantic
rationale often evident, it is tempting to construct a set of minor lexical
categories each with its distinctive set of functional possibilities, and to
isolate their shared semantic characteristics.
    An obvious example would be to set up an ""adjective"" subclass,
which could be defined as just those nominals that can only occur in
qualifier function.
    The grammatical ramifications of such a subclassification, however,
would not extend beyond the description of NP structure: all subclasses
have identical morphological possibilities. Moreover, there are many
facts that cannot easily be related to the semantics: why is it, for
instance, that maku 'woman' is used to denote the quality 'female', but
that wurkara 'boy' rather than bithiinda 'man' is used for 'male'?
    I will therefore assume that the specification of which function(s) a
nominal can perform is left to the relevant lexical entry in the dictionary.","[263, 264, 265]"

    The reconstructions of verbal and nominal morphology contained in Dixon
(1980), though attributed by him to proto Australian, are more plausibly viewed as
proto Pama-Nyungan.

        Map 3. Main genetic groupings of Australian languages
30      I The language and its speakers
There are also strong typological differences between Pama-Nyungan
and non-Pama-Nyungan. In general, non-Pama-Nyungan languages are
head-marking, make use of prefixation as well as suffixation, have four
or more noun classes, have weakly developed systems of subordination,
and make only optional use of core case marking. Pama-Nyungan
languages, by contrast, are generally dependent-marking (though many
use auxiliaries hosting clitic pronouns), use suffixation only, lack noun
classes, have a tightly organized and rich system of case marking, are
generally organized ergatively for nouns, and have a rich set of
subordinate clause types, often using switch-reference, antecedent case
agreement, or syntactically-defined pivots or some combination thereof.
    It is only along the eastern edge of the Pama-Nyungan / non-Pama-
Nyungan border that these correlations break down, and where
languages are found whose classification as Pama-Nyungan or non-
Pama-Nyungan has been revised.
   Yanyuwa, for example, was originally classified by O'Grady et al. as
a family-level isolate, but has been shown by Blake (1988) and Evans
(1988) to be Pama-Nyungan on the basis of its pronouns, case forms,
and the presence of initial laminalization; Blake has shown it should be
grouped with Warluwarra, Wakaya and some other languages in the
discontinuous Warluwarric group within Pama-Nyungan.
Typologically, however, it is in many respects a typical non-Pama-
Nyungan language, with elaborate prefixing morphology on verbs and
noun-class prefixes to nouns, although it does possess a participializing
suffix with cognates in many Pama-Nyungan languages.
   Karrwa and Wanyi together form a group that is transitional between
non-Pama-Nyungan and Pama-Nyungan in its pronoun forms, though
typologically resembling Pama-Nyungan. The languages of the Jingiluan
group, though clearly non-Pama-Nyungan, typologically resemble
Pama-Nyungan languages in having suffixing morphology, but recent
work by Blake (1990) shows this to have been a historically recent
development: verbal suffixes, for example, have developed by suffixing
an old auxiliary verb which bore prefixes.","[55, 56, 57]"
"6.3 Modifier types
Because few NPs contain nominals in every function, and because many
nominals are multi-functional, the identification of ""determiners"" and
""qualifiers"" in particular relies on certain decisive phrases that are either
fully expanded, or contain unifunctional words like kiyarrngka 'two'
that ""fix"" the position of the other nominals. The following discussion of
functional possibilities is based on such crucial NPs, although many
examples that I give will not be decisive in the above sense.
                                                    6.3 Modifier types    2396.3.1     Determiners
Determiners make explicit the identifiability of a NP. My use of the term
""determiner"" here diverges somewhat from its normal technical use in
syntactic description, since I am using it as a functional rather than a
word-class label; it may include pronouns, demonstratives, certain
noun/adjectives and compass locationals, provided they are functioning
to ""determine"" the reference of their head. In Kayardild, NPs lacking a
determiner may be definite or indefinite according to the linguistic
context: kiyarrngka dangkaa, for example, may mean 'two men' or 'the
two men'.
    ""Definite"" and ""indefinite"" are highly simplistic labels, summarizing
complex assumptions by the speaker about both his own ability to
identify the referent, and the ability of his interlocutor. In discussing the
use of determiners, therefore, I shall supplement these labels by more
explicit representations of the speaker's assumptions.
   The following may function as determiners. In (a) to (e) the identity
of the referent is known to the speaker, in (f) to (h) it is not. (Note that
more than one may occur in the one NP, e.g. dathina riya dangkaa 'that
man in the east', dathina niida dangkaa 'that same man'.)
(a) THE DEMONSTRATIVES dathina 'that' and danda 'this', as in danda
kiyarrngka wumburungka 'these two spears'. These determiners are
used when it is assumed that the hearer can identify the referent by its
demonstrated position in space (""spatial determiner"") or because it is an
important established participant (""discourse determiner""). See 5.3.2.1
and 5.3.2.2 for examples.
(b) THE COMPASS LOCATIONALS bada 'west', etc., and the derived
'from' forms such as bathinda 'coming from the west', as in bada
dangkaa 'the man in the west' and bathinda dangkaa 'the man coming
from the west'. See 5.3.2.1.
(c) THE PRONOUNS, as in niya jungarra dangkaa [he big man] 'the big
man' and ngarra kunawalada [we-du children] 'we two children'. Here it
is assumed that the hearer can identify the referent either because it is
established (3rd person) or because it is a participant in the speech act
(1st, 2nd person). Note that on this analysis the pronoun in a phrase like
the above is not just apposed ('we, the children') but helps identify
which children are being talked about. A sentence example is:
(6-11)    ngada bala-thu niwan-ju         naljirndirri-wu, marrwa-wu
          I:NOM hit-POT him-MPROP scrub turkey-MPROP near-MPROP
240      6 The noun phrase
            niya       rabi-ju
            he-NOM     get up-POT            'I'll shoot him, the scrub turkey, he'll fly up nearby.'(d) POSSESSIVE PRONOUNS, AND ATTRIBUTIVE NPS bearing the
ablative or genitive of possession. These assume that the hearer can
identify the referent by knowing who the possessor is, and which entity
belongs to the possessor. In thabuju-karra             kiyarrngka    maku
[big brother-GEN two wife], for example, the speaker is assumed to
know who 'big brother' is, and who 'big brother's two wives' are, and
is therefore assumed capable of identifying the two referents.
    Because the possessor must be readily identifiable, proper names or
kin terms are more likely to appear in the adnominal phrase, but common
nouns are possible in the right context.
    Adnominal locatives, as in nguku wuruman-urru [water billy-ASSOC]
'the water in the billy', could also be treated as determiners on semantic
grounds; certainly they are always definite. However, the fact that all
examples in my corpus are postposed makes the position test
impossible.
(e) THE QUALIFIER NOUN niida 'the same', as in niida dangkaa 'the same
man', and in (6-12). Here the speaker assumes that the hearer can
identify the referent, because it is identical to something that has just
been talked about.

"10.4 Evolution of the Tangkic modal case systems
Comparative reconstruction explains many of the unusual features of the
Kayardild and Lardil modal case systems:
(a) The formal similarities between (some) verb inflections and
modal case.
(b) The appearance of modal case, in ""marked"" modalities, on virtually
all NPs in the VP.
(c) Its more restricted domain in the unmarked modality.
(d) The semantic link between modal and more basic case uses. It can
also be shown that the unusual modal case systems arose from a
relatively normal proto system.
In all modern Tangkic languages case-assignment depends on main vs
subordinate clause status, and on the verbal categories of tense/mood. In
Yukulta (and probably in the proto language) a third series of factors is
important: negation, inverse person combinations, and irrealisness can all
trigger middle constructions in underlyingly transitive sentences. Because
case-assignment depends on so many factors, it is construction type,
rather than cases considered in isolation, that must be compared across
languages and used as the basis of historical reconstruction. Fortunately
most construction types are preserved, in some guise, in at least two of
the modern Tangkic languages, increasing the certainty of our
reconstruction.
424    10 The modal case system10.4.1 Nature of the proto-language
Despite an early suggestion by Hale (1970) that proto-Tangkic was
morphologically accusative, it is now generally accepted that it was
morphologically ergative.
     Hale had suggested that Australian languages of the majority ergative
type had evolved by generalizing a passive construction present in an
accusative proto language. As he pointed out, this hypothesis ""entails that
the so-called ergative case is simply that of the agent of a passive"" (Hale
 1970:764). Changes of this type have occurred in several Polynesian
languages (Hohepa 1969, Chung 1977).
     Consideration of the marking of demoted agents in modern Tangkic
passives gives no support to this. Each insular language has a different
pattern. In Lardil, demoted agents take the OBJective (< pT *DAT),
GENitive, or possessive pronoun. In Kayardild they take the ABLative,
OBLique (< pT *DAT), LOCative, or verbal allative. The limited data on
Yangkaal contains but one example, with a possessive pronoun. (Details
on these choices are in 9.3.2.2.) Such diversity suggests recent and
independent innovation, rather than continuation of an ancestral
construction.
     Klokeid (1978) and McConvell (1981), working independently, and
both relying on Yukulta and Lardil data only, advanced similar arguments
for an ergative ancestry.
    Firstly, Klokeid showed that the underlying (i.e. pre-truncated) form
of the Lardil 'OBJective' case is -NHTHa. This is identical to the Yukulta
dative, which can mark objects in middle constructions; Klokeid inferred
that the Lardil system arose through generalization of such a clause type,
which replaced the old ergative type.
    Secondly, Lardil (like Kayardild) leaves the (non-pronominal) objects
of imperatives unmarked; this can be explained as a last residue of
ergative morphology.
    Thirdly, both pointed out that the passive in Lardil arose from an
earlier reflexive construction with widespread non-Tangkic cognates.
    Finally, McConvell demonstrated similarities between some Lardil
main clause types and subordinate clause types in Yukulta, and suggested
that the former were derived from the latter.
    Although both Klokeid and McConvell agree that pT was ergative,
they propose different explanations of why the ergative proto system was
abandoned. I postpone discussion of this until 10.4.3.
    In this section, I will take the morphologically ergative nature of the
proto-language as established. The emphasis will be on the related
question of how modal case evolved, a question which the addition of
Kayardild and Yangkaal data now allows us to answer in some detail.

at the expense of the ablative and appositional constructions, and
attributed this to English influence. Another possible explanation is that
possessive pronouns, which neglect the distinction, are taken as a model.
     Sentence examples of the use of possessive pronouns are:

           that-NOM 2sgPOSS-NOM spear-NOM
           'That is your spear.'(5-25)     ringurrnga            ngijin-da dulk

distinction in non-nominative cases. This occurs because non-
nominative pronominal cases are built on the possessive stem. Thus niya
[3sgNOM] is formally distinct from the possessive form niwan-da
[3sgPOSS-NOM], but the LOCative of both is niwan-ji(ya), which is
ambiguous between 'him-LOC' and 'his-LOC'.
     Another example is bilwanji in the following two sentences:
(5-27)     ngada     kuni-ja      bi-l-wan-ji
           lsgNOM see-ACT         3-pl-POSS-MLOC

     In fact there is a corridor of languages with tense-dependent nominal forms
running south from the Tangkic group through Kalkatungu and Pitta Pitta to the
closely related dialects Gurnu and Bägandji (Hercus 1982) on the Darling River. In
these last two languages, however, special pronominal forms are involved, rather than
the alternative case frames found in Pitta Pitta and Kalkatungu; a Gurnu example is
wadhu Ί-past', gadhu Ί-future' (Wurm—Hercus 1976). A third variation on the
same functional theme is found in Karrwa (Furby—Furby 1977: 51-2). Here past
tense is signalled by a morpheme yi which may follow the verb stem or replace the
final vowel of one pronoun in the clause; future tense is marked by a clitic -dja,
optionally attached as either a suffix or a prefix to one word (of virtually any type).
Both past and future marking, it seems, are half-frozen tense clitics. The closely
related language Wanyi (Breen to appear) has a similar system.
20
    It is interesting that Capell (1979) suggested that Tangkic, Kalkatungu and
Kairwa are each isolate groups in the Gulf area.

    Heath's (1978) classic book on ""intense lexical diffusion"" in Arnhem land
mentions diffusion of nouns (including kin terms) and verbs, but not pronouns,
although he makes no specific reference to this.

PRONOUNS
Blake (1988) reconstructs distinct non-Pama-Nyungan and Pama-
Nyungan pronoun sets, which I draw on below. A number of features
clearly identify the Tangkic languages with the northern set 22 :• Non-singular second person roots in ki- (e.g. Kayardild kirra 'you
      two', kilda 'you pi.') correspond to roots in ku-/ki- throughout
      non-Pama-Nyungan. In Pama-Nyungan languages the
      reconstructed second person dual root is nyuNpalV        and the
      second plural root is nyurra .
• Non-singular third person roots in pi- (e.g. Kayardild pirra 'they
      two', pilta 'they pi.') correspond to roots in pu-/pi- throughout
      non-Pama-Nyungan. In proto-Pama-Nyungan the third person
      dual root was pula and the third person plural wasjana .","[59, 60]"
"4 . 4 . 1 . 3 Are verbal cases serial verbs? Where verbal cases have
corresponding free forms functioning as verbs, e.g. -maru-tha in
(4-110), a tempting alternative analysis is to treat the verbal element as a
serial verb.
     Constructions using serial verbs as prepositions, or to show case-like
relations, are found in languages as widespread as Yoruba, Igbo, Thai
and Chinese. In Chinese, for example, a number of NP arguments which
would be realized in English as prepositional phrases, and in most
Australian languages as phrases bearing oblique cases, appear as serial
verb constructions, in which the NP is object of the added verb: 'We
often go to New York"" is 'we often arrive New York go', 'S/He again
borrowed money from me' is 'S/He again follow me borrow money',
and so on (examples from Li—Thompson 1981, see also Hag£ge 1975).
     Could we not analyse the Kayardild verbal cases as serial verbs in
which the argument is incorporated into the valence-adding verb?
     There are four arguments against this.
     Firstly, it would be unusual for the incorporation process to be
repeated for each word in the NP.
     Secondly, serial verb constructions do exist in Kayardild with motion
verbs, but verbal cases have nothing in common with them syntactically.
In these serial verb constructions, discussed in 8.2.2 and 8.2.3, the order
of the two verbs is fixed; this is not so of the verbal case construction.
     Thirdly and most tellingly, the nominal arguments in verbal case
constructions are not in a syntactically or semantically consistent relation
to the verbal formative. With -marutha, for example, the suffixed
nominal is ""destination"" of the corresponding main verb. With the verbal
ablative -wulatha, whose corresponding free form bula-tha means 'pull
off, remove', the suffixed nominal is always the source, never the object
(the thing pulled). Such irregular semantic relationships are more
reminiscent of nominal compounding, with its inexplicit and varied
relationships between formatives, than of serial verbs, where the added
argument is always the object of the serial verb.
168       4 Nominals, Part I
    Finally, there is comparative evidence that such verbal cases
originated not as serial verbs, but by increasing the productivity of
compounds like the Yukulta verb darrmarlutha       [thigh-put] 'put on lap'.
    To summarize, verbal cases are neither serial verbs with prefixed
objects, nor derived nouns. They resemble normal cases in their phrasal
scope, concord, complete productivity, and, as we shall see, in their
range of meanings; they form part of the case frames for some verbs
(e.g. 'give'), and can be assigned as cases on demoted agents by voice
alternations. They do, however, have some verb-like syntactic
characteristics; these will be discussed in 4.4.3.","[194, 195]"
"Against these rather weak arguments, we can cite the restriction of
auxiliaries to Yukulta in the modern Tangkic languages, and the
frequency with which auxiliaries have developed under areal influence in
Australia (Yukulta has at least one neighbour, Karrwa, with an
auxiliary), as possible evidence that the auxiliary is a late innovation
confined to Yukulta.
     So far, then, there is no clear evidence either way. What would be
decisive proof of a proto-Tangkic auxiliary would be the discovery of
cognacy between the tense-markers in the Yukulta auxiliary, and verbal
or auxiliary morphology in non-Tangkic languages. But I have been
unable to locate such evidence.
     To turn to the causes of why any auxiliary that might have existed in
proto-Tangkic should have been lost, it is clear that phonological
explanations are inadequate. There is evidence that the processes of
truncation found in Lardil free forms did not affect clitics: the pT clitic
=ka, for example (9.7.4.2) is fully preserved in Lardil. More importantly
Κ and Ya, which as we have seen suffered only minor phonological
change, show no evidence of a clitic complex. (McConvell had no data
on these languages). It is therefore unlikely that any loss of auxiliary that
occurred resulted from sound change. We must therefore seek alternative
explanations—and a more recent paper by McConvell (1990:14) raises
the possibility of pidginisation. While the loss of such complex
morphology is quite compatible with what we know of pidginisation
processes, and fits in with the scenario of late Tangkic arrival in its
present location (1.4.2), we have no positive evidence for it, and for the
time being it must be regarded as no more than a plausible hypothesis.
     Whether proto-Tangkic never had an auxiliary, or whether both pre-
Lardil and pre-Yangkaal-Kayardild had lost an original auxiliary for some
unknown reason, we are left with an ancestral system with a very
restricted set of main clause tense/mood categories, but a developed
system of signalling interclausal tense/mood relations. Although unusual,
it conforms with the picture obtained by reconstructing verb inflections.
                           10.4 Evolution of the Tangkic modal case systems        449
Such a system would be under some functional pressure to recruit new
main clause categories, as McConvell argues, and the rich system of
subordinate clause types would have provided an obvious model: as
argued above, the syntactic shift from subordinate to main clause status
was accompanied by a semantic shift from relative to absolute tense.
    The historical productivity of this process in the Tangkic languages is
emphasized by the occurrence in Κ of a second round of insubordination,
to be discussed in Chapter 12: a second, outer layer of complementizing
case suffixes may also be used in main clauses. These either indicate the
ellipsis of a matrix perception, utterance or command predicate, or extend
to main clauses the ""odd pivot"" tracking mechanisms originally applied
only between matrix and subordinate clauses.
     In summary, then, the sweeping morphological and syntactic changes
undergone by die insular Tangkic languages cannot be attributed to sound
changes which wiped out key inflections in pT, as Klokeid and
McConvell propose. Rather, the reasons appear to have been functional:
the ancestors of Lardil and Kayardild-Yangkaal had a meagre set of main
clause tense/mood categories, but a rich set of subordinate clause types.
They redressed this imbalance by allowing the subordinate types to be
used in main clauses as well. In the process, old ""t-complementizing
case"" was imported as new ""modal case"".
    This had the effect of increasing the number of accusative-type
constructions allowed in main clauses: alongside the accusative
""detransitivized"" constructions were three (L) or six (K) old subordinate
constructions, also accusative, compared to the one ergative construction,
only possible in indicatives, imperatives and realis desideratives. To this
might be added the non-distinctness of the subject and object pronoun
forms in the ergative construction, whereas they were distinct in
detransitivized and subordinate construction types. It is not surprising
that in the end the accusative constructions were fully generalized and the
ergative construction fell into disuse.27
    There is no evidence that the above syntactic changes served to
realign morphological and syntactic categories, a mechanism Dixon
(1977b) credits with certain changes in Dyirbal and Yidiny, and also
relevant in the development of morphological accusativity in languages of
the Ngayarda group, which were already syntactically accusative (Dench
1982). The relation between case-assignment and syntactic function was
undoubtedly complicated in pT, but it has become even more so in K, Ya
and L: in addition to the complicated tense/modality-dependent marking
of objects found in all three, L in particular has a daunting array of
27
     Note, however, that Κ does have two constructions that could be considered
ergative: resultative nominalizations, probably a recent innovation (11.4.3), and the
bakiija qualifier construction (8.2.1.1). Lardil also has a newly-developed ""object-
topicalization"" construction that could be considered ergative (McConvell 1981:172-6).
450    10 The modal case systempossibilities for subjects. To consider active clauses alone, they may be
nominative (unmarked clause type), genitive (topicalized object in marked
modality) and accusative (subject of active contemporaneous clause).
There are also several possibilities for the ""underlying"" subjects of
passive clauses (9.3.2).
                          Chapter 11
                 Non-finite subordinate clauses
In this and the following chapter I discuss subordinate clauses. These
may be classified into non-finite and finite clauses according to the
cluster of syntactic criteria in Figure 11-1.","[475, 476, 477, 478]"
"1 0 . 4 . 1 . 3 Complementized subordinate clauses. Subordinate
clauses are normally more conservative than main ones (cf. Givon 1979),
and the Tangkic languages are no exception. Whereas pT main clause
types (1) and (2) have either been lost or undergone a drastic change of
function in all languages but Y, every modern Tangkic language
preserves several pT subordinate clause types. Accordingly, examples
from all four languages will be used here in support of our
reconstruction.
     Subordinate clauses in pT were formed by adding a
""t-complementizing"" 2 2 case suffix to the verb, following the -77/-
thematic, and a case-suffix to all NPs of the subordinate clause except the
subject where present. In Keen's Yukulta examples the subject is equi-
deleted from all but PRIOR clauses; it is hard to know whether this was
obligatory.
     Figure 10-5 summarizes the probable pT clause types. In negatives
the complementizer followed the negative thematic -nang- (7.2.1). To
simplify the exposition negatives, which have undergone comparable
changes, will not be discussed here.
     The complementizing cases transparently signal the temporal/modal
link between clauses. DATive and PROPrietive cases, for example, may
apply to NPs marking purpose; DATive and PROPrietive complementized
clauses have a similar ""purpose"" meaning, and function like ordinary NPs
bearing the approprate case. Likewise the CONSequential signals temporal
priority whether it applies to a simple NP or a clause.
     For most subordinate clause types—the various purposive clauses
(purpose, implicated and movement purpose), and simultaneous—the
case following the verb thematic and that appearing on NPs is identical.
    Purpose clauses, with reflexes in Y (10-59) and the Kayardild
hortative (7.2.3.10), involved a DATive on verbs and NPs alike:
(10-59)     kira warra-ja=rna,
Y           close go-IMP=him22
    Following Dench—Evans (1988) I use the term ""t-complementizing case"" for
cases that establish a temporal, spatial or logical relationship between a main and
subordinate clause; this is contrasted with the ""c-complementizing"" use of case to track
coreference relationships between arguments in main and subordinate clauses
(Mnemonically, ""t"" stands for ""temporal"", ""c"" for coreference). pT had both types, t-
complementizing and c-complementizing, with the latter outside; c-complementizing
case is discussed in 12.6.1.

"1 0 . 3 . 2 . 5 The domain of modal case marking: overview.
Modal blocking within the VP, as we have seen, always links it
semantically with the subject in some way: a body part is seen as part of
the subject himself; a goal or motivation is conceptualized as a personal
concern of the subject, not necessarily evident to the public eye; a
13
    But it is interesting to note that in the one clause type with no active
correspondent—namely RESultative clauses—demoted agents do take modal case. See
11.4.3.
422     10 The modal case system
transferred object is seen as possessed by the subject either before or
after the transaction.14
    The exact semantics of ""subject orientation"" varies from construction
to construction. It is clear, however, that the determination of ""subject
orientation"" requires a far more detailed representation of case meaning
than that provided by ""thematic roles""; rather, something like
Wierzbicka's detailed explications of the Russian instrumental
(Wierzbicka 1980) may be needed.
    Whenever this representation includes explicit reference to the
subject, modal blocking is appropriate. Glancing briefly through our
examples, the ""body part as instrument"" meaning includes a component
like 'SUBJ did something with X, which is part of SUBJ's body'; the
PROPrietive ""private goal"" includes a meaning component something like
'SUBJ is thinking about PROP, SUBJect wants to be in the same place as
PROP'; PROPrietive themes with transfer verbs would express a meaning
something like 'SUBJ has PROP; because of this SUBJ can cause OBJ to
have PROP' for wuuja 'give' and 'SUBJ has PROP after causing OBJ not to
have PROP' for marndija 'deprive'. In other words, the (complex)
predicates expressed by the case suffix include as arguments at least the
host NP and the clausal subject.
    The meanings of the non-subject-oriented NPs, on the other hand,
may all be framed without specific reference to the subject. There are a
number of possibilities here:
(a) The predicate expressed by the case can have as arguments the host
NP and the proposition encoded by the clausal core, as with adjuncts like
the (relational) LOCative.
(b) The predicate may take as arguments the host and the object, as with
the INSTRumental of contact: 'INSTR came into contact with OBJ, causing
something to happen to OBJ'.
(c) The predicate may take as arguments the host and something else
whose identity is left to context. The ""UTlLitive of conventional purpose""
is an instance of this—a possible formulation is 'one could see the people
would use X with/to make UTIL'. Here the role of context is dual: it
supplies the identity of X, which is usually an OBJect, e.g. (4-97) to
(4-100), but may also be a second predicate on the subject (as in 10-35).","[448, 449]"

A note on translations:English translations are my own unless in inverted commas; these latter
are usually in Mornington English. Readers should note that   (a) definiteness and gender are not grammatically marked in
   Kayardild, and I have translated these according to context;   (b) the unmarked 'ACTual' tense may be past or present,
   according to context.   (c) Kayardild terms that are highly specific semantically, such
   as pronouns, kin terms, and zoological/botanical terms have in
   places received a less specific English translation.   (d) in general, I have supplied utterance translations rather than
   sentence translations, meaning that they may be more
   semantically specific than the source sentence itself requires.

                The language and its speakers1.1     Linguistic type
Kayardild is a dependent-marking, agglutinating, entirely suffixing
language with a free order of phrasal constituents and a rich system of
case marking, which functions both to relate NPs to the verb (1-1), and
to relate one NP adnominally to another (1-2, 1-3).","[23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28]"

9.7.6 Interjections
These have no syntactic function, and usually make up a complete
sentence. They include:warirr    '(I've got) nothing; nothing doing; no.' (May also be used as a noun,
          meaning 'nothing').
yukurdida 'That's right; there you go' (e.g. when easing a blind man into a car).
kwiy      'Wow!' (A pleased exclamation at one's own success).
dankuruk! 'hey! Whatcha doing?' 'You gotta be kidding!' (An expression of outrage)
ngani     'Oops, oh no!' This expresses disappointment at one's own stupidity (for
          example after leaving a spear behind, or missing a fish), or self-correction,
          as when substituting one word for another.
yakay     'Watch out, wow, ouch!' (Expresses surprise or sudden pain). While
          watching an event continue, as when watching a willy-willy tear through
          the camp, it may be reduplicated indefinitely: yakayakayakayakay..!
yaniyuud 'Wait a minute!' (Related to yanda 'now' and yuuda 'first').
yaa! yaa! (A special exclamation used during wind magic).
ngii       'yes'. 2 1Five interjections that use sounds outside the normal Kayardild phonemic
repertoire are:ht           (A forceful aspiration followed by an unreleased alvolar stop,
             made while dancing.)21
       This word is used rarely, however. Assent is more commonly expressed by
repetition of the interlocutor's assertion, by use of the clitic {-ida } 'same', by the
English loan 'yeah', and by the words junku-d [straight-SAME] 'true indeed' or yuud,
lit. 'already'—cf. Italian gid.

                     The modal case system
The ""modal case"" system is one of the most unusual and interesting
 features of Kayardild grammar. We have already seen how suffixes
whose basic function is adnominal or relational can be used to signal
modality (3.4.3); that these follow adnominal or relational case suffixes
but precede associating and complementizing suffixes (4.1), and that
their domain is, roughly, all NPs except subjects and those associated
with subjects. Their correlation with verb inflections for tense, mood and
aspect was discussed, in simplified fashion, in 7.2.2. The present
chapter draws together the discussion of modal case as a system.
     Firstly (10.1) I review the correlations between modal case and
verbal tense/mood/aspect. For a subset of sentence types modal case
seems to be distributed across the VP, appearing as modal case on NPs
and as the termination on verbs. With other sentence types the many-to-
one relation between verb-inflections and modal case invites an analysis
in which modal cases code superordinate categories subsuming the more
specific categories marked on the verb. Even this analysis, however, is
too simple: to a limited extent modal case can be varied independently of,
or in the absence of, verb inflection.
    In 10.21 discuss the semantic overlap between modal and adnominal
or relational uses of case. There is, I argue, a parallel between modal case
and the widespread use of local cases or prepositions as
complementizers. But where the complementizer use of local case codes
temporal or modal relations between clauses, i.e. relative tense/modality,
modal case codes absolute relations between a single clause and the
speech act.
    In 10.3 I examine the domain of modal case in more detail. This
roughly corresponds to the VP. But certain NPs, that the ""associating
OBLique test"" (9.4.1.1) show to be inside the VP, nonetheless exhibit
""modal blocking"", escaping modal case: e.g. PROPrietive ""intentional
objects"". I argue that these are ""semantically oriented"" to the subject in
the sense that a statement of their meaning must refer to the subject. A
parallel is drawn between modal blocking and ""ergative agreement"" in
other Australian languages.
    In 10.4 I use comparative data from within the Tangkic subgroup to
show how the modal case system evolved. Two factors in the proto
language combined to produce the modal case systems found in
Kayardild, Lardil and Yangkaal: (a) the replacement in main clauses of
fully transitive ergative constructions by detransitivized case frames
                            10.1 Verbal tense/mood and modal case categories        399
under certain semantic conditions, and (b) the use of local cases as
complementizers, marked over the verbs and NPs of subordinate clauses.
With ""insubordination""—the reinterpretation of subordinate as main
clauses—these complementizers became markers of absolute rather than
relative tense/modality. Since both (a) and (b) type constructions were
morphologically accusative, the evolution of modal case is closely bound
to the abandonment of morphological ergativity in Kayardild, Yangkaal
and Lardil.","[423, 424, 425, 426]"

                                Preface
The material for this book was gathered during field trips to Mornington
and Bentinck Islands in June 1982-January 1983, May-July 1984,
October 1985, April-May 1986, September-October 1987, June 1988,
August 1989, April and December 1992, September 1994, and during
June 1987 when a group of Bentinck Islanders attended a Kayardild
literacy course at the School of Australian Linguistics in Batchelor,
Northern Territory. Before my first field trip I was able to do some
preliminary analysis of Stephen Wurm's 1960 recordings and fieldnotes
on Kayardild, and examine the insightful works on the related languages
Yukulta (Keen 1972, 1983) and Lardil (Hale 1973, Hale et al 1981;
Klokeid 1976).
    The project was initiated following a request to Bob Dixon by the
Bentinck Island community, who were concerned about the fate of their
language and wanted a linguist to record it. Between 1982 and 1985 my
research concentrated on Kayardild grammar and text collection, and the
grammar in Part I is a substantially revised version of Evans (1985), a
dissertation submitted for the degree of Ph.D. at the Australian National
University. Subsequently I was able to continue gathering the text and
lexical materials contained in Parts II and III of this book, and to revise
various parts of the grammar.
    Community support for the project was overwhelming, and virtually
every Bentinck Islander helped me in some way. Thanks to this, my
fieldwork procedure could be quite eclectic. It combined participant
observation while hunting, fishing, drinking, ""seeing the country"" in the
the South Wellesleys, reminiscing and gossiping, arguing, attending
community meetings, and farewelling people at the airport, with more
structured sessions ""working on language"": gathering and transcribing
texts and stories, plodding through paradigms, building up
comprehensive word lists, and discussing the meaning and
appropriateness of particular constructions heard in spontaneous
conversation.
    The grammar contained in this book deliberately eschews theory-
specific assumptions and formalisms. My many frustrating experiences
trying to extract generalizations about a particular language from a
grammar, or ""fragment"" of a grammar, written in the ephemeral garb of a
once-fashionable theory, have convinced me that grammars of little-
known languages should be presented in as straightforward language as
possible, and furnished with a generous set of naturally-occurring
example sentences and texts. Only in this way can readers glean enough
χ     Preface
to reach their own conclusions about the internal consistency and
empirical accuracy of the description. And only when a relatively full
informal account of a language's structure and its resources for encoding
meaning becomes available can the next step, of more formal modelling,
be taken. The present work does no more than indicate the rough
direction this might take.
    In analysing this highly unusual language I have drawn freely on
whatever grammatical tools seemed appropriate, without worrying
whether they all came from the same toolkit A few key terms understood
differently by different linguistic schools are discussed in Chapter Three,
and pegged to language-specific definitions. Certain new terms
necessitated by the novel structure of Kayardild are also introduced there.
    Although the analysis I give is self-sufficient synchronically, I have
included comparative/historical material from other Tangkic languages in
several places, so that the grammar has ended up containing the seeds of
a historical-comparative grammar of the Tangkic group. Experience has
shown me that the more bizarre features of Kayardild grammar were only
accepted by otherwise broad-minded linguists once their less eccentric
pedigrees had been established.

" 3 . 1 . 2 . 1 Phrasal inflection and lexical derivation. The
 distinction between ""inflection"" and ""derivation"" is a fundamental and
 traditional one, well formulated by Anderson (1982: 588): ""the central
 issue ... appears to be the difference between processes which operate
 with essential reference to structure beyond the word-level vs processes
 which simply provide alternate words on the basis of the (word-)initial
 structure of the base."" Derivational processes, that is, create new lexemes
 which would be listed in a dictionary; while inflection fits these into a
 larger syntactic whole.
      Despite the importance of this distinction, it is not always easy to find
 formal tests that will label a morpheme unambiguously as inflectional or
 derivational.
      One diagnostic often employed is word-position: inflectional affixes
 usually lie ""outside"" derivational affixes. Among Australianists this
 ""followability criterion"" has become something of a standard test. Blake
 (1977: 38), for example, writes of the genitive suffix in Australian
 languages that ""the suffix to the possessed is usually regarded as a stem-
forming        affix (my italics—N.E.) and can be followed by case
 inflections""; and Dixon (1980: 322-3), writing on Australian languages in
 general, asserts that ""each word has an obligatory root and final
 inflection; between these two constituents there can optionally occur one
 or more of a number of derivational suffixes."" However, the
 followability test is not suitable for Kayardild, which allows extensive
 multiple inflection, with sequences of up to four case-like inflections
 (3.4.7). For an overview of other Australian languages permitting
 multiple case inflection, see Dench—Evans (1988).
                                3.1 Parts of speech and phrasal categories   89
    In Kayardild a more fruitful test is based on the insight that inflection
essentially operates on units ""beyond the word level"", in particular on
phrases, while derivation applies to individual lexemes. In illustration of
this, inflections exhibit concord over the relevant noun phrase or verb
complex, so that 'on that beach' is dathin-ki ngarn-ki [that-LOC beach-
LOC], and 'will hit hard' is kurulu-thu bala-thu [kill-POT hit-POT],
    Derivational suffixes, on the other hand, never show phrasal
concord, but must be limited to a single word. For example the
inchoative suffix, deriving verbs of becoming from nominals, can apply
to the word mundundunkuru            'maggot-PROP, maggotty' to give
mundundunkuruwatha        'become maggotty, become fly-blown', but not
to the phrase jungarrawuru mundundunkuru [big-PROP maggot-PROP]
'full of fat maggots'. A different construction must be employed, using a
copula with a NP complement (9.1.8). Alternatively, a new lexeme may
be derived by compounding a noun and adjective, and this compound
lexeme may then take the inchoative derivational suffix: thus nalda birdi
'bad (in the) head' yields the compound nalbirdi [head-bad] 'mad,
drunk', which may then take the inchoative derivational suffix, giving
nalbirdiwatha 'go mad, get drunk'.
    In this grammar the possibility of phrasal concord will be taken as the
crucial test distinguishing inflection from derivation. This allows us to
handle the multiple inflection discussed in 3.4.7. It also enables us to
deal with suffixes which, though functionally inflections, change the
word class of their targets.
    Another characteristic of inflections is that they are fully productive
and regular in meaning; whereas derivational suffixes are limited to a
small number of lexemes and often produce fairly idiosyncratic changes
in meaning. This distinction correlates well with the phrasal scope test.
Note, though, that sometimes inflectional forms may have a derivational
use, in which case their scope is limited to the word.","[115, 116]"
"5 . 2 . 1 . 1 Analysis of stems. Temporarily leaving aside the non-
singular forms, the nominative and possessive pronoun forms can be
neatly segmented as follows:
      Person             Inclusion   Number          Possessive stem
      1    nga-          -ku-        Dual -rr-       -wan- (~-umban-)
                                     Plural -/-
      2    ki-
      3    bi-The possessive pronoun formative -wan-, with irregular -(u)mban- in the
second singular ngumban-, is clearly cognate with the ORIGin case, with
its parallel irregular alternation between -wan- with noun/adjectives and
-umban- with compass locationals (the source of lsg -(i)jin- is a
mystery). It is likely that in pT -mban-/-wan- was the possessive case
form, and that semantic specialization has in the modem languages split
this into a possessive pronoun formative with pronominals, and a distinct
ORIGin case elsewhere; certainly in Κ they can no longer be treated as one
suffix.
     Most ""subject oblique"" forms add -waa (after consonants or
monosyllables) or -wa (after vowel-final disyllables) to the possessive
pronoun stem, minus the -wan- formative. Alternatively, they can be
derived by deleting η from the possessive stem). Epenthetic vowels that
are optional in the possessive pronoun forms are obligatory in the subject
oblique:   2 sg           kirr-wan-da             kirr-waa
   3 sg           ni-wan-da               ni-waa
   2 plu          kil(u)-wan-da           kilu-wa
204      5 Nominals, Part II    Subject oblique forms in Κ are cognate with dative forms in Yukulta 9
and probably proto Tangkic, as in the Yukulta sentence:(5-19)     nguku-wa kirla-ka=thu              ngijuwa
Y          water-ABS fetch-IMP=lsgOBL           lsgDAT

7 . 8 . 3 Idioms with free nominal arguments
A number of idiomatic constructions involve a verb and a body-part
nominal. These often exhibit semantic similarities to the prefixed-nominal
constructions given above, and may be the historical source of at least
                                         7.8 Noun-verb compounding    297some of them. But in idioms the verb and nominal are separate words:
they can be reordered (although the elements of the idiom remain
contiguous), and the nominal is inflected for case. For example the idiom
bardaka kamburija [stomach say] 'say to oneself, think without speaking'
involves a nominal in the nominative case, and allows the alternative
ordering kamburija bardaka.

may be expanded to include preverbal particles, and complexes of verbs

               Kayardild-English Dictionary
The following Kayardild-English dictionary is a slightly revised version
of the first part of Evans (1992a), which also contains an English-
Kayardild finder list and a Kayardild ethnothesaurus, neither of which
are included here. Illustrations for the dictionary were drawn by Penny
Johnson and the late Marbuk Kohler.
Entries are arranged as follows, grouped together into lemmas .
(a) HEADWORD (in bold). The word to be defined. Verbs are given in
their 'ACTual' form, e.g. baaja 'bite, bites, bit'. Nouns are given in the
nominative form, e.g. baburrka 'splash'. Some words have variant
pronunciations, shown in brackets, e.g. kabanda (~ kabarnda)
'stargazer (fish)'. Homonyms are distinguished in headwords through
the use of numerical subscripts, e.g. biriidaj 'body'; biriida2 'father'.(b) PART OF SPEECH (in italics), e.g. v.t. (transitive verb) for baaja,
and n. (noun) for baburrka.
(c) DIALECT (normal type, in brackets). Words from the Yangkaal
(Forsyth Island) dialect are indicated by (Ya), those found in both
Kayardild and Yangkaal by (K, Ya). Most of the Yangkaal words have
been taken from Hale (1962); some were transcribed by the author from
Ross Charles, Ronnie Charles and Cora Peters. If no dialect information
is given this means that the information pertains only to Kayardild.
    Sometimes this information follows just part of an entry—for
example, (K, Ya) after the first meaning, 'tooth', of d a m a n d a
indicates that only this meaning is known for both Kayardild and
Yangkaal; the other meanings are known only for Kayardild. Usually
this reflects the fact that we know much less about Yangkaal than
Kayardild.
(d) ROOT or OBLIQUE FORMS (in bold between square brackets, e.g.
[bath-] after bada 'west', [LOC duujinji] after duujinda 'younger
brother'). This is used for nominals whose root and/or non-nominative
forms cannot be predicted from the nominative form given in the
headword. The root serves as the basis for most other declensions of the
noun. Note that such special information is not given where the root
differs from the nominative in a predictable way. Nouns ending in nda,
rnda, Ida and rlda always take off the da to get the root unless otherwise
                                          Kayardild-English   Dictionary   637
indicated; those ending in ngka always take off the ka. Full details of
nominal declensions are in 4.2 of the Grammar.
(e) MEANING(S). One or more senses of these may be given, depending
on how rich the word is in polysemies (multiple meanings); each sense is
numbered. In some cases I follow a number of senses or alternative
translation equivalents with a single general sense in square brackets: an
example is the entry for kurrngu. Sometimes an English word giving
the meaning is in quotation marks, e.g. birmarutha cause trouble for
OBJ without intending to, ""spoilim""; this marks it as the usual translation
in ""Mornington English"".
    As the ""place-marker"" OBJ in this definition illustrates, I sometimes
use grammatical abbreviations to show how particular words of the
English definition plug into the Kayardild: in this case, it means that
whatever word fills that place in the definition will be treated as a
grammatical object in Kayardild. Sometimes only words of a certain
meaning can be plugged in; this is shown by characterizing the type of
word that can be inserted through the use of a colon, e.g. under the entry
for dunbuwatha the definition '(Faculty: body part SSPRED) become
useless for its natural purpose' means that this meaning of can only apply
to nouns, designating body parts that represent some mental or physical
faculty (e.g. the ear for hearing and memory), and that this noun will be
treated grammatically as a secondary predicate on the subject, agreeing
with it in taking the nominative case.
(f) EXAMPLE SENTENCES. AS far as possible I have tried to include
example sentences showing how a word is used; these are followed by
English translations. Example sentences and translations are given in
smaller type.(g) SYNONYMS, i.e. words of the same meaning, are given in brackets,
after an equals sign. This information is not represented systematically in
the Kayardild-English section and can be discovered more systematically
in the thesaurus.(h)   SUB-HEADWORDS, IDIOMS AND FIXED EXPRESSIONS f o l l o w the
information for the headword. In some cases they contain the same range
of information (from (b)-(g) above) as normal headwords.","[661, 662, 663, 664]"
"Although the constituents identified in this way are typically contiguous,
they need not be (Chapter 6). In this grammar I will assume that
constituency is independent of contiguity or linear order, but diagnosed
by the distribution and ordering of case inflections at various levels. Of
course many examples are less straightforward than those just given,
since there exist a number of specific rules blocking the occurrence of
inherited case in certain situations, such as the rule preventing the
complementizing locative appearing on pronominal subjects (12.1.6), or
the rule preventing modal case from appearing on indirect objects
(10.3.2), but this does not mar the general usefulness of case inflection
as a test for constituency. Throughout this grammar the term
""constituent"" will be used in this special sense, implying immediate
domination but not order; the same applies to c-structure representations.
    While the use of case inflection as a diagnostic clearly distinguishes
NP and S constituents, the existence of a VP constituent is more
problematic, although the domain of both modal case and associating
case approximates the VP.
    Modal case appears on what could be defined as a VP minus certain
grammatically specifiable NPs (such as indirect objects and a few
""subject-oriented"" NPs with a semantic connection with the subject).
Historically it appeared on the verb as well, and most verb inflections
comprise a thematic element plus what is etymologically an old case
marker (7.3.3). However, this analysis is of limited value
synchronically, as I will argue in 10.1. Most importantly, the verbal
inflection is independent of modal case to a certain extent, so that it
cannot be assigned by the same inflectional category. The best we could
                                3.4 Functional domains of case inflection   121
say synchronically, then, is that modal case appears on all but a
syntactically defined subset of NPs within the VP.
    Associating case is a better candidate for diagnosing the VP: it appears
on all NPs within the VP, but not on the verb itself. The only NPs to
escape it are the subject and certain secondary predicates clearly
associated with the subject (9.4.1.1).
    With both associating and modal case it would be possible to state the
conditions on their distribution without reference to the VP: that is, as all
NPs in a clause, minus the subject, secondary predicates on the subject,
and (in the case of modal case) indirect objects and some NPs
semantically associated with the subject.
    Stating the distribution of these items in this way would capture the
semantic fact that modality and tense are semantic operators with clausal
scope, and that nominalization takes clauses, not VPs as input. It seems
likely that the historical explanation for the failure of modal case to appear
on subjects has to do with the original distribution of modal case over all
overt constituents of subordinate clauses, which typically lacked an overt
subject (10.4).
    What is more, our grounds for postulating a VP in Kayardild are
weakened by the lack of any other syntactic evidence that could
corroborate the criterion of case distribution—I have been unable to find
any test that could be used as an equivalent to tests for VP-membership in
other languages, such as the scope of ""so did"" conjunction in English.
    Despite these arguments against the usefulness of postulating a VP
constituent in Kayardild, I will continue to use the term VP in places
where I discuss the distribution of modal or associating case marking,
simply because it is more convenient than the long list of conditions that I
would otherwise need to use.

                           Nominate, Part I
The nominal word class includes a number of subclasses (3.1):
noun/adjectives, pronouns, locationals, and manner and time nominals.
In this chapter I discuss the case system, which is essentially identical for
all nominal subclasses, plus a few nominal suffixes for number and the
like. Derivational, compounding and reduplicational processes in the
noun/adjective subclass, and specific properties of the remaining nominal
subclasses will be treated in the next chapter.","[147, 148, 149]"
" 1.4.2.1      Typological comparisons. Typologically the Tangkic
languages—especially Yukulta and what we can reconstruct of proto-
Tangkic—have very little in common with their closest relatives in
Arnhem Land, and in fact could pass for typical Pama-Nyungan
languages. These similarities are summarized here without substantial
justification, which is given in comparative asides to the relevant
sections of the grammar.
    Although the grammar of all modern Tangkic languages is extremely
unusual, the most plausible proto system was not atypical for a Pama-
Nyungan language: suffixing, agglutinating, basically ergative, with free
word order and a rich array of case inflections. Like many Pama-
Nyungan languages, in particular those of the Northern Nyungic area, it
may also have had an auxiliary which followed the first constituent and
carried information about tense and mood, as well as subject and object
bound pronouns. The ""modal case"" which is such a distinctive feature of
Kayardild and Lardil was not a feature of proto-Tangkic, nor was
""verbal case"" present in other than incipient form. However, the use of
case agreement on complement clauses, governed by the case of a main-
clause antecedent, was more clearly present than in modern Kayardild or
Lardil; again this is characteristic of many Pama-Nyungan languages and
is particularly well-developed in the northern Nyungic area.
    The main peculiarity of proto-Tangkic was a system of
detransitivized constructions triggered by certain tense, mood and
polarity conditions characteristic of ""lowered discourse transitivity""
(Hopper—Thompson 1980). In irrealis desideratives, for example,
transitive clauses had an ABSolutive:DATive case frame rather than the
usual ERGative:ABSolutive frame.
    The typological resemblances between Tangkic and two Pama-
Nyungan subgroups are also worth mentioning. The Ngayarda
subgroup (Pilbara district, W.A.), like Kayardild/Yangkaal and Lardil,
has become morphologically accusative from an ergative ancestor
(Dench 1982). This is undoubtedly a recent and completely independent
development. Closer at hand, Kalkatungu (Blake 1979b), Yalarnnga
(Blake 1971) and Pitta Pitta (Blake 1979a), spoken to the south of the
32      1 The language and its speakers
Tangkic subgroup, are all basically ergative but with accusative
constructions triggered by various tense/mood conditions (see Blake
1987), a feature they share with Yukulta and proto-Tangkic19.
    This raises the question of whether the common presence of tense-
triggered non-ergative constructions in Tangkic, Kalkatungu and Pitta
Pitta is due to some genetic affiliation, especially since all are aberrant in
a number of ways (pronouns, lexicon and case forms) 20 . But there are
no other similarities between Tangkic and these languages (and cognacy
rates lie in the 2-3% range), which makes this hypothesis unlikely. More
probable is a previous period of contact and structural diffusion of the
relevant constructions.","[58, 59]"

This correlates fairly well with the distribution of the reflexive formative
-yi and the reciprocal formative -nyji/-nyju     (see below), and of certain
vocabulary items. However, the other resemblances between these
families and Tangkic are minimal and a more definitive picture must
await more detailed reconstructions of these groups.","[61, 62]"
"The modal oblique, as in (10-14), is commonest, for the most basic
meaning expressed by the apprehensive is that the event described is or
would be unpleasant, calling for the ""emotive"" oblique. But in certain
situations more potent factors may override this: in (10-15) the speaker
stresses his certainty of being able to effect an unpleasant retaliation by
choosing the ""future"" modal proprietive.5 (In Lardil the cognate of the
PROPrietive—the 'Future OBJective'—is the only modal case allowed
with the APPRehensive; see (10-82)).
     A third possibility is that the unpleasant event is actually taking place,
as in (10-16).6 Here the LOCative modal case shows the reality of the
occurrence, while the APPRehensive verb inflection expresses the
speaker's distress.
    These examples show that modal case does not always depend on the
verb inflection, but can to some extent be varied independently, allowing
for a multiplication of subtle meanings. From this we may conclude that
modal case can encode a separate meaning from that given on the verb,
although the need for the two to be logically compatible (one cannot state
simultaneously that the same event has actually happened and will occur
in the future) places strict limits on the set of possible combinations.7
5
     The ""emotive"" modal oblique would also be acceptable here, and would emphasize
the unpleasantness of the consequence.
6
    The use of ""lest"" clauses to describe actually-occurring undesirable events has been
reported for Yidiny (Dixon 1977a:352-3).
7
     There appear, however, to be conventionalized co-occurrence restrictions beyond
the call of semantic compatibility. The DIRECted verb inflection, for example, always
406     10 The modal case system    An ideal grammar of Kayardild would combine the formal
generalizations made by the VP-distribution rule (10-4) with the semantic
generalizations about modal case as a semantic category superordinate to
verbal inflection; it could also allow for the ""independent"" use of modal
case just discussed. To do this it would need:
(a) ""Distribution rules"" of the type proposed in 10.1.1, along with
""category-sensitive"" variants.
(b) ""Semantic diagnosis"" rules that would select an appropriate modal
case after examining the semantic content of the verb inflection.
(c) ""Independent"" rules that could re-assign modal case on a semantic
basis, in defiance of, or in the absence of, (a) and (b).
The ""independent"" use of modal case has not been reported for Lardil,
and thus seems to be a recent Kayardild innovation, encouraged by the
association of each modal case with a semantically coherent group of
verbal inflections.
    The modal case system has proved particularly vulnerable to
English/Kriol influence. Some young speakers have abandoned the past
and apprehensive inflections and their attendant verbal cases: in their
place they use the particles bin and baymbay (""bye and bye""), together
with the indicative verbal inflection and the locative modal case. They do,
however, retain the future verb inflections and proprietive modal case.
    Other, middle-aged, speakers, though not affected by English to the
extent of replacing the traditional tense/mood system with particles, do
have a system in which modal case correlates entirely with verb
inflection: the independent use of modal case described above is not
found. In other words, their grammar could be explained by a modality
distribution rule. Thus the independent use of modal case described in
this section is restricted today to the oldest speakers. And as one would
expect, Wurm's recordings of Kayardild, made in 1960, contain a higher
incidence of independent uses than is found today.
    Elsewhere in Australia are many other cases where those features of a
language most interesting for general linguistic theory are the first to
disappear following English contact; the situation is probably similar
throughout the colonial world. Two examples are the disappearance of
syntactic ergativity from Dyirbal (Schmidt, 1985) and the tendency
among younger Warlpiri speakers towards freezing of word order (Bavin
—Shopen 1985), which would leave it a more ""configurational""
language.selects the modal ALLative, even though prior, instantiated or future values would be
semantically compatible with it.
                                  10.2 From bcational to modal case meaning          407
10.2      From locational to modal case meaning
In this section I examine the extent to which relational or adnominal
meanings can be related to the modal meanings of the same case. This
bears crucially on whether modal cases should be treated as different
functions of the same case, as suggested in 3.4.8, or as homophonous
forms quite distinct from the more usual case functions. More generally,
it answers the typological question of why modal case should exist at all.
I will argue that whereas relational cases relate the NP they mark to the
action described by the verb, and case-like complementizers in many
languages extend this to the relationship between two clauses, modal
cases relate the event described by the clause to the event of the speech
act.
     The relevant cases are all, in a broad sense, locational: LOCative,
ABLative, ALLative, PROPrietive (having) and OBLique (etymologically an
old dative).8 These locational cases are essentially two-place predicates.
But there is no inherent restriction on what arguments they take. Used
adnominally (""the fool on the hill"") they take two entities (NPs) as
arguments. Used ""relationally"", they take an entity argument (e.g. a local
NP) and a proposition (the core of the clause). Used as complementizers
they take as arguments two propositions: the main and subordinate
clauses.
     As the arguments being related change from NP to clause—i.e. as
""rank-shifting"" occurs—only some languages retain the same locational
markers. Yidiny, for example (Dixon 1977a:332-346), does not use
regular case suffixes as complementizers, but the subordinate verbal
inflection is formally similar (and possibly related diachronically) to a
local case.
     Nevertheless, probably the commonest pattern is for local case
markers or adpositions to double as complementizers. English, for
example, uses local prepositions with the infinitive, as in ""they stood up
to applaud the musicians"". In Australia, many Pama-Nyungan languages8
     Clark (1970) argues that ""possessive"" and ""having"" (here, PROPrietive)
constructions are closely related to the semantically more fundamental ""locatives"".
Although her discussion is primarily concerned with predicative constructions, it can
be applied with equal validity to attributive constructions employing adnominal
suffixes. Possessives, she maintains, are more appropriate when the ""location"" is
animate, and the thing located is not definite; the ""having"" relation is more appropriate
when the location is animate and the thing located is definite. Accordingly, she groups
existential and locative constructions (both ""hyperlocatives"") with possessive and
""having"" constructions (both ""possessives"") under the joint rubric ""locational"". Her
analysis may be extended to include the ALLative as the directional counterpart of the
LOCative and the DATive as the directional counterpart of the PROPrietive (i.e. ""want
to have"".)
408       10 The modal case system
mark the appropriate local case on every subconstituent of the
subordinate clause (except, of course, equi-deleted subjects), as in Djapu
(10-17, from Morphy 1983:132-3). This appears to have been the
situation in proto Tangkic (10.4.1.3).(10-17)     rjayi       ror/iyi-n    [nM-nhara-yur      mälu-'mirrirju-walij
Djapu       3sgNOM return-PERF see-NMLSR-ABL father-KINPROP-OBL
            'He has come back from seeing his father.'
            (Human nominals in Djapu take OBLique case suffixes for the ablative
            case function.)All of this is quite familiar, and few would dispute that genuine polysemy
is involved, with similar relationships being set up between arguments of
different types. Of course, the meanings of these relationships are not
identical—with complementizers, the temporal meaning usually
predominates over the spatial, for example—but a cluster of related but
distinct meanings is typical of case polysemy, and more generally in
""grammaticalization chains"" (Heine—Claudi—Hiinnemeyer 1991). The
important thing is that a substantial semantic overlap can be established.
     The particular type of extension at issue here—that from spatial to
temporal meanings—has been known for a long time (e.g. Cassirer
 1923, Kronasser 1952) and the use of locationals as temporal or
purposive complementizers, as in ""she stood up to sing"", is found
throughout the world's languages.
     Modal case, because it is so unfamiliar, may not appear to follow this
pattern. I would claim, however, that it represents a further application of
the case-as-complementizer pattern, but taking as its arguments the event
of the speech act and the event expressed by the clause. The main
difference from the uses just discussed is that here only one of the
arguments—the proposition containing modal case—is overtly
expressed. The other—the (time of the) speech act event—is not
expressed by any linguistic material, but given by context.
    This is typical of deictics. The word ""now"", for example, means
something like ""the time at which the event described in this proposition
happens is the same as the time at which I say this""; it could therefore be
treated as a two-place predicate taking as arguments the containing
proposition, and the context of utterance.
    The difference between relative and absolute tense provides a good
analogy with the difference between complementizing and modal uses of
a local case, and in fact the evolution of modal from complementizing
case corresponded to a shift from relative to absolute tense, as we shall
see in 10.4.2.3. Relative tense involves a temporal relation between two
propositions: the main and the subordinate clause. Absolute tense, on the
other hand, involves a temporal relation between a proposition and the
context of utterance. If we think of this in terms of ""worlds"", then
                            10.2 From locational to modal case meaning   409
relative tense relates the ""world in which [main clause]"" to the ""world in
which [subordinate clause]"", while absolute tense relates the ""world in
which [main clause]"" to the ""world including this speech act"".
    This ""absolute"" complementizing use is far less common than the
relative complementizing use, but examples are found in a number of
Creoles. In Tok Pisin the originally spatial word klostu ('close up')
signals an ""almost"" modality, as in dispela haus klostu pundaun 'this
house is nearly falling down / nearly fell down' (Dutton 1973:101). And
in Gullah (Nichols 1975) the preposition for, as well as being a locational
marker and a complementizer, may mark modal obligation in a main
clause: where for put this 'where should one put this'.
    Having noted these somewhat marginal parallels from other
languages, I would now like to examine the Kayardild modal cases from
this perspective. With the LOCative, ABLative, ALLative and PROPrietive,
I will argue, the link between modal and adnominal/relational meanings is
synchronically valid. With the OBLique, links of this type may once have
existed but have been obscured by reconstructable historical changes.
    Before discussing the semantic links, a note on the problem of the
representation of the meanings to be connected. Although a number of
recent scholars within the broad ""cognitive semantics"" movement have
paid attention to space/time polysemy, their means of representing
meaning have varied widely. Some, such as Langacker (1986) have used
diagrammatic visual representations; others, such as Wierzbicka
(Goddard—Wierzbicka 1994) use verbal definitions. Although visual
representations have the advantage of conciseness, and of relating
linguistic meaning to non-linguistic schemata, they have the disadvantage
that their visual conventions may not be adequate for representing the
more complex and subtle case meanings, and more importantly it is not
clear how particular semantic components can be subjected to linguistic
argumentation. I therefore adopt, below, a definitional approach to case
meaning, using the ""natural semantic metalanguage"" developed by
Wierzbicka and her colleagues (Goddard 1989, Goddard—Wierzbicka
1994). Note that the expression ""can be thought of as"" is intended to
capture metaphorical extension.
    The modal LOCative, as we have seen, marks the modality
""instantiated""; in other words it describes a state of affairs the speaker
knows to be occurring or have occurred. The choice of the LOCative,
which primarily expresses the coincidence of two entities, is obvious
enough with present events, but at first sight may appear inappropriate
for past ones. Recall, though, that the modal ABLative with the PaST
verbal inflection is used when pastness is being stressed; choice of the
ACTual verb inflection, together with MLOC, stresses the actuality of the
event. We can summarize this as follows: ""the world including this
speech act this can be thought of as in a world where [Main clause]"".
410       10 The modal case system
    The ""prior"" modality associated with the modal ablative can similarly
be paraphrased as: ""the world including this speech act can be thought of
as coming from a world where [Main clause]"". Where it is functioning
relatively, as with PRECONdition clauses, the following substitution
could be made: ""the world where [Main clause] can be thought of as
coming from a world where [Subordinate clause]"".
    The modal ALLative is used for events just coming into the speaker's
awareness, or to describe activities as they approach the speaker. The
link between relational and modal meanings here is obvious: the meaning
of the latter may be represented as ""the world including this speech act
can be thought of as moving towards a world where [main clause]"".9
    The use of the modal PROPrietive to code futurity requires some
further explanation. Semantic developments from 'have' to futurity,
mediated by a stage in which 'have' represents obligation, have occurred
in the history of the Romance languages (see Fleischman 1982 for an
overview) and also in Ukrainian, for example citat' imu [read have-I] Ί
will read'.
    But in the Tangkic languages a different semantic pathway has been
followed. There is ample evidence in Kayardild grammar for a link
between the PROPrietive and expectation. The employment of the
PROPrietive to mark the ""intentional objects"" of verbs like 'search for' or
'wait for' was noted in 4.3.5.4 and 9.2.3. Moreover, it may attach to
active or passive nominalized verbs, producing the meaning 'able to V' or
'one can expect this to V' (11.2.11.1). It may also mark some entity
whose subsequent appearance is augured by an omen. In (10-18), from a
mythical story, the protagonist has gone out spearing fish. All the fish he
sees are a bloody red; unknown to him, this signals the imminent
approach of the lecherous mud-dwelling predator Barrindindi,
accordingly marked with the PROPrietive.
(10-18)     mutha-a     yakuri,     yarbuth-uru       dathin-kuru Barrindwdi-wuru
            many-NOM fishNOM monster-PROP that-PROP (name)-PROP
            'There were many fish, heralding that monster Barrindindi.'","[432, 433, 434, 435, 436, 437]"
"
3.1 Parts of speech and phrasal categories
From Dionysius Thrax onwards it has been normal grammatical practice
to define parts of speech through a combination of morphological,
syntactic and semantic criteria. This works well enough when all three
criteria coincide, but is more problematic in languages where, for
example, a given word may be a ""syntactic noun""— defined perhaps by
its ability to govern case agreement and follow a determiner—but a
""morphological verb""—defined by the fact that it inflects for
morphological categories such as tense, mood, and polarity.
    Kayardild is such a language. Although morphological and syntactic
criteria, taken alone, yield clearcut results, there are cases when they do
not give the same category. In other words, the grammar sanctions
various types of mismatch between morphological, syntactic and
semantic criteria. In this section I proceed by first defining a set of word
classes on predominantly morphological criteria; then looking briefly at
the two phrasal projections of these classes found in Kayardild, namely
NP and VC; and finally considering the various types of categorial
mismatch that are possible.",[111]
"(1-21)   A young man appears, and the speaker says of him:
         [ngijuwa     mima-tharra-nth]
          lsgCOBL     beget-PST-COBL
          'He's my son.' (lit. Ί begot (him).')The fourth unusual feature of Kayardild is the existence of a second
series of case suffixes which behave semantically and syntactically like
ordinary case markers—in marking roles like recipient, direction of
motion, instrument and so on, in occupying the same morphological
position as regular case markers, and in showing concord over the NP—
but which convert their hosts from morphological nouns to
morphological verbs, which then agree in all verbal categories with the
main verb. I shall refer to this phenomenon as ""verbal case"".
    Two examples from a series of six are the ""verbal dative"", which
marks beneficiaries and recipients, including the indirect objects of
'give' (1-22), and the ""verbal allative"", which marks destinations (1-23,
1-24).(1-22)   ngada         wuu-ju        wirrin-ku    ngijin-maru-thu

            cave-VALL-NEG.POT            Ί will not go to that cave.'","[34, 35]"
"In these examples I have supplied two glosses for the relevant
morphemes—one relating to its more basic and normal case function
(locative, ablative, proprietive); the other to its semantic content—
""prior"" in (1-9), ""future"" in (1-10) and (1-13), ""emotive"" in (1-11), and
""instantiated"" in (1-12). In the rest of this grammar I shall in general
only use the first type of gloss, but will use the second type when it is
relevant—for example when arguing about the semantics of the modal
case categories. In addition to the four categories just given there is a
""directed"" category, marked by the modal allative and signalling
inceptive aspect or direction of the event towards the speaker, and a
'zero' category, marked by the absence of modal case, which is used in
imperatives (e.g. 1-1) and progressive nominalizations.
   Modal case—which as far as I know is unique to the insular Tangkic
languages—appears to have evolved from two sources. A detailed
comparative-historical study is in 10.4; for the moment these sources can
be summarized as(a) the use of case to show interclausal relations (e.g. locative on all
words in a subordinate clause to show simultaneity); this construction
was later generalized to main clause use.
4        1 The language and its speakers
(b) the existence of a number of detransitivized case frames, responsive
to modality, negation and inverse person combinations, in which the
object is marked with an oblique case—the locative, dative, or
proprietive.","[30, 31]"
"There is comparative evidence explaining this block. As I will show in
12.6.1, the Kayardild Complementizing LOCative descends from an
ergative-antecedent use of the proto-Tangkic ergative/locative. But in
Yukulta, and we may infer also in proto-Tangkic, free pronouns do not
have an ergative form distinct from the nominative. A phrase like
ngakulda bakiinki in (12-14) would have had exactly the same form in
proto-Tangkic if it had been an apposed pronoun and noun—the pronoun
would have been formally indistinct from the nominative, while the noun
would have taken the ergative/locative. Thus the failure of Kayardild
subject pronouns to show the complementizing locative simply continues
the lack of a distinct ergative form for free pronouns in proto-Tangkic.",[521]
"
7 . 3 . 4 Reconstruction of final inflections: summary
The evidence assembled above suggests that all pT verb inflections, with
exception of the imperative -ka, the irrealis imperative -ki and the
desiderative -da , derived from nominalizations inflected for case. For
positive nominalizations the nominalizing base was -TU-, identical to the
indicative suffix; for negative nominalizations it was -na(ng)-.
    This reconstruction is based on very restricted evidence: on
morphology alone, and verb morphology at that. Before we can
understand the wider causes of these changes, we must place the verbal
suffixes in a broad syntactic perspective. This will be done in 10.4,
where I argue that the above verb inflections were originally limited to
subordinate clauses, in which a complementizing case appeared on both
the nominalized verb and its nominal arguments. These complementizers
coded relative tense/mood between clauses: simultaneity with the
LOCative, anteriority with the CONSequential, and so on. Later, the
complementized clauses were ""insubordinated"" (i.e. reinterpreted as main
clauses) and the complementizing cases came to code absolute rather
than relative tense.
    The scenario presented here and in Chapter 10 leaves us with a rather
puzzling proto language: rich in interclausal relations, but poor in its
stock of main clause tense/mood categories. Indeed, McConvell (1981)
effectively proposes that one reason for the subsequent insubordination
was to enrich the inventory of main clause categories. One possible
explanation for this is that the proto language, or its predecessor, was
wholly or partly pidginized, leading to a drastic simplification of the
276    7 Verbalsverbal inflections; these were then replaced by case-inflected nominalized
verbs. This would account for the almost total lack of verb inflections
relatable to those in any other group—only the imperative -ka is cognate
with the set of inflections Dixon reconstructs for ""proto-Australian"".
    Unfortunately, however, very little is known about pidginization
between Australian languages, as against between Indo-European and
non-European ones, and until more is known about this it is hard to
assess how plausible the changes suggested above really are.
    A second possibility, also implicit in McConvell's scenario, is that in
proto-Tangkic, tense was not marked on the verb but on the auxiliary, as
in Yukulta. Loss of this auxiliary in Kayardild and Lardil created a need
for a new means of tense marking, which was met by the process of
insubordination described above. Note that something very similar to this
appears to have happened in the nearby languages Karrwa and Wanyi:
       It seems that Wanyi and Garawa have lost a system of auxiliaries
       which presumably hosted bound pronouns. They retain old infinitives
       which now represent the neutralisation of a number of previous
       distinctions probably including tense and aspect. Garawa seems to
       have developed a new system of marking tense and aspect via clitic
       particles and Wanyi ... seems to be getting by without such a
       distinction. (Blake 1990: 64)
7.4 Derivations: verb-verb
These come between the stem and the final inflection.
    The conjugation they recruit into is shown here by the following
ACTual suffix. For instance the middle suffix {-yii-}, which always
derives palatal conjugation verbs, will be represented as {-yii-ja}. And
the iNCHoative, which always derives dental conjugation verbs, will be
represented as -wa-tha.","[302, 303]"
"
6.3.5      Part-whole NPs
In these a ""part"" nominal is juxtaposed with a ""whole"" nominal. These
constructions are used when one entity is thought of as an inseparable or
inalienable part of, an alternate manifestation of, or a subset of, the
other. The orders part-whole and whole-part are equally likely. As with
generic-specific constructions, there are no syntactic reasons for
considering one nominal to be the head, and it is better to treat them as
apposed nominals. Another similarity with generic-specific constructions
is that each word may be prefixed to a nominalized verb, as in
kandu-diya-n-da dangka-diya-n-da [blood-eat-N-NOM person-eat-N-NOM]
'eater of people's blood' (Text 1, Line 13).6

    This ""harmful object"" use probably results from the inclusion of 'snakes' within
the reference of yarbuda .
6
    Two tests could be used to isolate a ""semantic"" head:
(a) Scope of numerals. Does kiyarrngka barthaa dangkaa [two track man] mean 'two
tracks, of a man' or 'tracks of two men'. I did not investigate this in the field and
cannot answer this.
(b) Semantic consequences of omitting one nominal, ngada balatha dangkaya nali
[I hit man head] Ί hit the man's head' is interpreted as roughly synonymous with
248      6 The noun phrase      There are several semantic subtypes of part-whole NP:(a) body parts, as in dangkaa thukanda [man chin/beard] 'man's
chin/beard', ngida wamburra 'tree trunk'. Excretions and eggs are also
included here, e.g. bangaa kuru 'turtle egg(s)'. Severed body parts take
the GENitive, e.g. wanku-karra daman-da [shark-GEN tooth-NOM],
except where the species of their former possessors is at issue, e.g.
wanku-wa daman-da [shark-NOM tooth-NOM] 'shark tooth'. With human
body parts the possessor may instead take a possessive pronoun or a
genitive noun/adjective, even when the part is not detached (4.3.8.2,
5.2.2.1).
   Body part constructions within the NP, such as those just given,
must not be confused with the 'body-part as instrument' and 'body-part
as locus of effect' constructions (9.4), where part and whole, although
agreeing in (relational) case, are represented by distinct NP constituents.(b) tracks, as in jara barthaa 'foot track' and barthaa bangaa 'track
turtle', and the wakes of fish, as in yakuriya dakarnda 'fish wake'.
(c) language, names, voice and characteristic sounds, e.g. waydbala
kangka [whiteman language] 'the white man's language'; bangaa
wangarra [turtle song] 'the song/sound of turtles'; dangkaa nida [person
name] 'a person's name'; mutha-mirra kangka dangkaa [many-INTENS
language person] 'many sounds of people'; niya thawurra [he throat]
'his voice (quality)'.(d) spirits, as in dangkaa ngabaya 'person's spirit'.
(e) 'story-places', seen as alternate manifestations of mythical beings.
See Text 4, Lines 18 and 19.
ngada balatha dangkaya Ί hit the man', while ngada balatha nali [I hit head] would be
interpreted as Ί hit (a detached) head', even if 'he' is well established in the discourse.
This argument suggests that the ""inalienable possessor"" or ""whole"" is semantic head
with body part constructions.
    With ""track"" constructions, on the other hand, the omissibility argument suggests
the ""part"" (the track) as semantic head: ngada kurrija bangaya barthaya [I saw turtle
track] is a more explicit version of ngada kurrija barthaya Ί saw a track', but is a
totally different proposition to ngada kurrija bangaya Ί saw (a) turtle'.
    And with ""composite"" constructions like ngada kurrija kawukaya jardiyaliya Ί
saw a bundle of fighting sticks', either nominal can be omitted: Ί saw a bundle' and
Ί saw fighting sticks' are both synonymous with the part-whole version.
    It is thus impossible to make a single generalization about whether the ""part"" or
the ""whole"" is ""semantic head"": this depends on the subtype of the construction.
Much more work would be needed before the exact semantic relationships can be
delineated.

dangkaa 'stone man (Kajurku)'.

fighting-stick] 'a bundle of fighting sticks'.

1 0 . 4 . 3 Possible reasons for the loss of ergativity                     and
            development of modal case
As the ""why"" of language change is always more uncertain than the
""how"", I have so far restricted myself to reconstructing what changes
probably took place, without going into their possible causes. To the
latter, more speculative, question this section is devoted.
     Klokeid (1978) proposed that phonological change was the
motivating factor in undermining the ergative system of pT. The battery
of truncation rules that has shortened Lardil stems would, he claims,
have eliminated the ergative as a distinct case, with subject and object
forms no longer distinct in the ""basic"" construction type. The other,
middle constructions, in which they were distinct, would then have been
taken as canonical. Klokeid's argument is repeated in Dixon (1980:457).
     Two objections can be made to this analysis. Firstly, it is simply not
true that truncation destroyed the distinctness of the ergative case. As
mentioned in 10.4.1.1, the ergative of non-pronominals in pT, as in
Yukulta (Appendix B), was formally identical to the locative. And this
locative is preserved as a distinct case form in Lardil, having undergone
some irregular sound changes, so that {-(ng)e) replaces pT {-kiya}. On
the basis of other, regular sound changes we would expect {-(ng)i}26 but
there has been irregular lowering of the vowel, probably conditioned by26
    The initial k, which occurred only after nasals, changed to ng by progressive
assimilation of nasality. A similar change has produced Lardil ngan [GEN] from pT
karran in this environment.
                         10.4 Evolution of the Tangkic modal case systems   447
the original following glide. In short the Lardil locative, which continues
a form identical to the pT ergative, has remained distinct from the old
ABSolutive despite the many phonological changes undergone by Lardil.
    A second objection relies on evidence from Κ and Ya, unavailable to
Klokeid when he wrote the above article. In Κ and Ya there have been
only very minor phonological changes, and the nominative (< pT
absolutive) and locative (<pT locative = pT ergative) are clearly distinct in
all but one declension class (which was not distinct in pT either)—see
4.2. But despite the relative phonological conservatism of Κ and Ya,
comparable morphosyntactic changes have occurred. We must therefore
seek a non-phonetic causal mechanism.
    On the other hand, pronominal subjects and objects appear to have
been formally identical in pT (10.4.1.1). This would certainly have
favoured the growth of any construction in which they were distinct.
    McConvell (1981) offers a functional explanation for these changes.
He suggests that in pT, as in Yukulta, there was a clitic complex or
""auxiliary"" distinguishing past, present and future tenses; verbs did not
distinguish tense, but signalled mood and polarity. When ""truncation""
eliminated the tense element of the auxiliary (limited in Y to a segment
NCV in final position), main clauses were left with no means of signalling
tense. To this ""there was a radical solution: the subordinate clause types
of Proto-Tangic (sic) ... which did make a distinction of tense ... were
transplanted as main clause types"" (p. 163). This further increased the
proportion of accusative-type constructions in main clauses, until ""Lardil
took the output of the ANTIPASSIVE (nominative subject—dative object)
as the canonical form of the uninflected tense type, thus eliminating
almost the last trace of ergative syntax, and bringing the uninflected type
into line with the other indicative tense types"" (p. 165).
    McConvell's scenario contains three logically independent subplots:
(a) the supposed existence in pT of a tense-bearing auxiliary,
(b) the destruction of the auxiliary by the sound changes collectively
known as truncation, and
(c) the reanalysis of pT subordinate as main clauses, and subsequent
""crowding out"" of the originally canonical ergative construction.
While I believe (c) to be likely, and (a) to be plausible, the status of (b) is
problematic.
   The evidence for the existence of an auxiliary in proto-Tangkic is not
decisive either way.
    In favour of attributing an auxiliary to pro to Tangkic, we can say that
448    10 The modal case system(i) the Yukulta auxiliary system contains a lot of fusional and hence rather
old-looking morphology; many of the bound pronouns cannot be related
to free forms, and nor can the tense/mood markers(ii) as Blake (1990) has pointed out, the Yukulta auxiliary can be
regarded as containing person prefixes to a tense marking auxiliary base;
if attributed to proto-Tangkic, this would provide a link to the prefixing
non-Pama-Nyungan languages of Arnhem Land to which the Tangkic
languages are most closely related. The languages of the Jingiluan family
provide a clear parallel for the move from a prefixing language to a
suffixing language in which the only residual prefixes are in an auxiliary,
deriving from a degenerate prefixed verb (Nordlinger 1993).","[473, 474, 475]"
"4 . 2 . 2 Comparative remarks on case forms
Unless otherwise noted, the Kayardild forms can be shown to preserve
the pT original. I do not wish to go into all the details here.
    Few of these inflections have recognizable cognates outside the
Tangkic languages.
    The existence of a non-zero NOMinative inflection in Yukulta,
virtually identical to the Kayardild NOMinative4 was noted as unusual by
Capell (1979); it may have originated as a discourse particle {-ha}
(lenited intervocalically to -wa , assimilated in place of articulation to
preceding consonants etc), but clear evidence is lacking: see 4.3.2.
    Instrumental -nguni has a possible cognate in Guugu-Yimidhirr
ergative/instrumental -ngun (Haviland 1979a) but the form is not
widespread; moreover, comparison with Lardil suggests that the pT
ancestor merely marked ""having"".
    Privative -warri is probably reduced from a free form warri, so
widespread with the meaning ""bad"" that it is a good candidate for proto-3
     Two points should be emphasized here: (a) this variation is not due to PROSODIC
TRUNCATION (2.3), since reduction from -kiring- to -kir-, for example, occurs whether
or not the relevant word is breath group final; furthermore, the addition of clitics does
not protect the form, whereas it blocks prosodic truncation, (b) the appearance of
""word-internal"" forms does not depend on the ""level"" of the case inflection; merely on
the fact that another inflection follows. The ALLative, for example, will be -kir
word-finally, and -kiring- word-internally, regardless of whether it functions
relationally or modally, and regardless of the function of the following suffix.
4
     The only difference is with disyllabic roots in final /a/, which take a nominative
suffix in /-ra) in Y and in /-a/ in Kayardild.

Australian; see Evans (1990b) on the extension from ""bad"" to ""privative""
in Australian languages. In any case, -warri can be reconstructed back to
proto-Tangkic with privative meaning 5 .
    The PROPrietive {-kuru}, deriving from pT { - k u r l u } (preserved in
Yukulta) by regular sound change, has cognates in Warlpiri and Kukatja
PROPrietives -kurlu and probably the Nyangumarda privative -kurlu. The
most likely scenario is that it is an early loan into Tangkic from some
northern Nyungic language, such as Warlpiri, at a time when Tangkic
was spoken well to the west of its current position 6 .
    The LOCative {-kiya} , which in pT must have also had an ergative
function (as in Yukulta), and the ABLative {-kinaba }, have no obvious
cognates in nearby languages. However, within the Yiram group some
400km to the west we find possible cognates: the ergative/locative in
Ngaliwurru includes -ki (after the velar nasal) and -i (after I or w);
another allomorph -ni, with no Tangkic correspondent, has been
generalized in the other Yiram languages. Within the pronoun paradigm,
both Nungali and Ngaliwurru have possessive -kina. The exact
interpretation of these similarities is problematic at present—do they
represent inherited shared characteristics, or loans, and if the latter, in
what direction? However, there is some other lexical evidence for early
contact between Tangkic and Yiram (see Evans in prep).","[155, 156]"

3 . 1 . 1 Word classes
For Kayardild five major word classes may be set up, based on the
suffixing possibilities of each word. These are mutually exclusive; each
root belongs to just one class. A number of derivational processes change
word class; those deriving nominals from verbals are discussed in 11.2
and 11.3, and those deriving verbals from nominals in 7.5. The word
classes are:

    1. Nominals             (a) noun/adjective
                            (b) pronoun
                            (c) locational - demonstrative
                                            - compass locational
                                            - positional

                            (e) predicate nominal
                            (f) time nominal
   2. Veibals
   3. Particles
   4. Inteijections
   5. ConjunctionsThe noun/adjective subclass and the verbal class are essentially the only
open classes, although a few English loans are passing into the particle
and interjection classes (9.7.3).
    The nominal and verbal classes are the most important and populous.
In general nominals denote entities or attributes, and verbals denote
actions. States like ""know"", ""be ignorant"" and ""be jealous"" are expressed
by predicate nominals in Kayardild. The two major classes have distinct
inflectional possibilities. A nominal word is obligatorily inflected for
case; a verbal word must take one of a rich set of tense / mood / polarity
markers. Nominal and verbal words also have distinct sets of derivational
suffixes.","[111, 112]"

     My use of ""function"" as an abbreviation for ""functional domain"" here should not
be confused with the more usual meaning of case ""function"" in a phrase like ""another
function of the dative in Russian is to mark the deep subjects of certain types of verb"";
I shall also use ""function"" with this second sense. The presence of such qualifiers as
""modal function"", ""adnominal function"" etc. should disambiguate the two senses of
""functional domain"" and ""function within a domain"" (e.g. marking instruments, within
the relational functional domain).

Unclear cases are in brackets—the GENitive, ORIGin and Associative, for example, are
used with demoted agents of ""resultative nominalizers"", and this could be treated as
either an ""adnominal"" or a ""relational"" use. The LOCative may only be used
adnominally if no other case suffix follows. The NOMinative is an ""elsewhere case"", in
equipollent opposition to all other cases: it appears only where no relational, modal,
associating or complementizing case is assigned.","[128, 129]"

    I use the term nominalization rather than participle because of the absence of a
morphologically-defined adjective class in Kayardild; since the functions of Kayardild
nominalizations cover those of both nominalizations (deverbal nouns) and participles
(deverbal adjectives) in some languages, nominalization seems a more appropriate
term.
                         11.1 Morphological structure of nominalized verbs   453
All nominalized clauses have special rules for assigning relational and
modal case; ""plain"" nominalized clauses, for example trigger
""Associating OBLique marking"" (3.4.5), and resultative nominalizations
have an ergative argument structure.
    Together with nominalized clauses I will discuss ""lexical
nominalizations"": words like wangal-ngudinda 'boomerang thrower',
ngijin-kinyiliyarrba 'one who was given form (brought into the world)
by me', and warrku-darayarrba 'one circumcized at daybreak'. Like
clauses, these have an argument structure with a verbal predicator and up
to two arguments: one prefixed, the other the referent of the
nominalization. Like clauses, there are regular rules governing the voice
of the verb stem and the semantic roles of the arguments. Syntactically,
however, they are nominal words (usually entity nominals). They may
inflect for number and nominal derivational suffixes such as muthanda
'excessive', may be modified by other nominals, and are part of a NP.
And where the arguments of syntactic nominalizations are free NPs,
lexical nominalizations must incorporate their arguments as prefixes.
    ""Motion purpose"" clauses give a motivating action toward whose
execution the matrix subject is moving in space as well as time.
Syntactically they are 'DlRECted' VPs directly embedded beneath a matrix
adjunct NP; all their constituents (including the verb) take a further modal
case inflection in agreement with that of the matrix clause:
(11-8)    balmb-u            ngada  dali-ju           ngumban-jiring-ku
          morrow-MPROP       lsgNOM come-POT         2sg-MALL-MPROP          kamburi-jiring-ku
          speak-DIREC-MPROP          'Tomorrow I'll come to talk to you.'","[479, 480]"
"What is important, then, is not that each verb have identical argument
structures, but merely that they have non-conflicting argument structures:
it is acceptable for a NP to be an object of one verb in a clause but bear no
grammatical relation to its clause-mate, but it is unacceptable for a NP to
be subject of verb A and object of verb B.
     This contrasts with the stricter constraint found in many
morphologically ergative Australian languages (such as Dyirbal
(Dixon 1972: 64), Yidiny (Dixon 1977a: 252), Ngiyambaa (Donaldson
1980: 203) and Kalkatungu (Blake 1979b)) which requires that all verbs
and adverbs in a verb complex agree in (surface) transitivity. If we accept
Goddard's (1982) argument that such languages have three core cases,
ergative (A), nominative (S) and accusative (O), the reason is clear: if
transitive and intransitive verbs were mixed in a clause, they would
assign conflicting cases (ergative and nominative, or nominative and
accusative) to their subject. In an accusative language like Kayardild, on
the other hand, there are no grounds for distinguishing A and S cases,
these being joined in a single ""nominative"" case, so there can be no case
clash.
     The various elements of the VC may be more or less tightly linked,
both syntactically and semantically; three types can be identified. I shall
now examine these, proceeding from the looser to the tighter.",[330]
"
4 . 4 . 4 Discussion4 . 4 . 4 . 1 Origins. As we have seen, the verbal case system integrates
complex verbals of quite different provenance. The allative was formed
by deriving an inchoative verb from a nominal inflected for the locative
case. Formation of all the other cases involved prefixation of nominals to
verbals, but the case relation originally obtaining between the prefixed
nominal and the verb varied considerably: proprietive with the verbal
purposive and donative cases, ablative with the verbal ablative and
evitative, and locative with the verbal dative.
     Comparative evidence suggests that the fully-fledged verbal case
systems in Kayardild and Lardil have evolved quite recently. Yukulta has
two verbal cases, corresponding to the Verbal Ablative and Verbal
Evitative in Kayardild. Corresponding to other verbal cases in Kayardild,
Yukulta has non-productive patterns of derivation (e.g. kalarr-i-watha
[open space-LOC-lNCH] 'come out into the open') or nominal prefixation
(with marlutha 'put' and janija 'look for'). The verbal case systems
almost certainly evolved by increasing the productivity of these
formations, and by expanding the scope from word to phrase.

    How was the transition made from lexical to phrasal scope? I believe
that the ""apposition"" or ""unmerged"" analysis of NP structure (6.1)
provides an answer. Under this analysis, the words of an NP like 'the big
man' are not parsed as sister NPs below a common NP node, but as
apposed NPs: 'the big one, the man'. If NPs in proto-Tangkic had this
kind of structure, each word of the ""unmerged NP"" could undergo the
word-level process of derivation or compounding, e.g. [big-put man-put]
for 'put to the big one, put to the man'. Later changes in syntax, leading
to a more structured ""merged"" interpretaton of the NP, would cause such
sequences to be reinterpreted as NPs over which 'put' shows concord,
rather than apposed compounds.","[207, 208, 209]"

7 . 3 . 3 Origin of final inflections as nominalized                         verbs
          inflected for case
The above reconstruction suggests that most final verbal inflections
originated as nominalizations inflected for case. The thematic -TH- would
have formed affirmative nominalizations, and the modern thematic
-na(ng)- would have formed negative or privative nominalizations.
Supporting this hypothesis are two arguments:
(i) In most Australian languages, only nominalized or other non-finite
verbs can inflect for case. Many languages have special nominalized
forms distinct from finite inflections—examples are Djapu (Morphy
1983: 131-9) and Ngarluma (Simpson 1983: 28), in which nominalized
forms of the verb may inflect for a variety of cases, showing different
relations between main clause and complement. In other languages, such
as Pitta-Pitta (Blake 1979a: 218-9), Yuwaaliyay (Williams 1980),
Anindilyakwa (Dench—Evans 1988) and Djamparrpuyngu (Wilkinson
1991) one finite form, usually identical to the past or indicative, doubles
as a nominalized form. Proto-Tangkic -TH(a), which could be both
indicative and nominalization, seems to have parallelled the latter type;4
     Kroskrity (1984) describes a similar phenomenon in Arizona Tewa, where
subordinate and negative clauses are formally similar. He suggests that the original
marking of negatives involved the structure 'Not [Clause (Subord.)], Clause (Aff.)'.
Subsequently, ellipsis of the affirmative clause allowed negative clauses to be
""insubordinated"".
                               7.3 Final inflections: a comparative note   275
note the parallel properties of the (possibly cognate) Anindilyakwa past
inflection -ja.
    In proto Tangkic, as in the above languages, most verb types
deriving from nominalizations inflected for case were restricted to
subordinate clauses. Their main clause use evolved later (10.4.2.3). If
the -TU- and -na(ng)- thematics were originally nominalizations, this
would explain why they could host the case inflections discussed above,
and also why further          case inflections, in the form of the
""complementizing case"" discussed in Chapter 12, are allowed.
Significantly, the Kayardild desiderative, which does not derive from a
nominalization, does not allow further case inflection (12.1.6).
(ii) This hypothesis also fits in with the account given in 10.4 of how
modal case evolved. Most modal cases are related to the case-like final
component of some pT verb inflection. This is what we would expect of
complement clauses with case markers both on the nominalized verb and
its arguments.","[301, 302]"
"In such sentences one may treat the verbal case as governing Ν Ρ
arguments in various grammatical functions, shown here by arrows:(4-154)               nyingka         ngijin -maru-tha              kuwand
The proposition this encodes needs to make reference both to the free NP
arguments and to the incorporated24 NP. A rough logical representation23
    Omission of the main verb is attested with all verbal cases. With the Verbal
Dative, however, it is only possible with the transfer of position or transfer of
ownership meanings, not with the benefactive meaning.
24
     Here I am using ""incorporated"" in a very general sense, and do not wish to imply
that ""noun incorporation"" of any of the four types described by Mithun (1984) is
involved.
178       4 Nominals, Part I
of (4-154) is ""SUBJ cause OBJ to move to INCORP"" where INCORP is the
incorporated NP.
    A satisfactory representation of verbal case, then, requires verb-like
argument structures, making reference to several (typically three) NP
arguments and their grammatical functions. But it must also allow verbal
case to distribute over every word in the NP, or, alternatively, to
incorporate as a prefix every word in the NP. How this is done will
depend on the syntactic theory being used, and I will not go into this
question here.
    The two alternatives of ""distribution"" and ""incorporation"" imply
different representations—the former more case-like, the latter more
verb-like. Historically the Verbal Allative arose through distribution, the
other verbal cases through noun-verb compounding.","[204, 205]"

9 . 2 . 7 Accusativity and argument structure: some typological
          consequences
As shown above, a large number of Kayardild verb lexemes alternate
between transitive and intransitive case frames. Other accusative
Australian languages are comparably liberal, as shown by the following
examples from Lardil and from Martuthunira (Ngayarda subgroup):Lardil (Hale et al 1981)Lexeme                  Meaning in               Meaning in transitive frame

waa                     'go'                     'go/come to OBJ; overwhelm OBJ'
yileyi                  'be afraid'              'fear OBJ'
luuli                   'play'                   'play with OBJ'
Martuthunira (Dench to appear)paya-npa-nguru          'get angry, 'get wild'   'get angry with OBJ'
[angry-INCH-PRES]panyu-npa-nguru         'feel good, get well'    'feel good towards OBJ,
[gOOd-INCH-PRES]                                 do something good for OBJ'
In most ergative Australian languages, such as Dyirbal (Dixon 1972),
Yidiny (Dixon 1977a: 206), Ngiyambaa (Donaldson 1980) and Diyari
(Austin 1981a), on the other hand, such alternations in transitivity are not
possible. A given verb lexeme is either transitive or intransitive, and
alternations in transitivity must be accompanied by some formal marking,
such as a change in verb conjugation.
    Dixon (1980: 378), basing his generalization on the ergative majority,
comments: ""every verb in an Australian language is strictly transitive—
occurring with subject (A) and object (O) NPs—or strictly intransitive—
occurring just with a subject (S) core NP. It is usually a simple matter to
determine transitivity."" liiere are three classes of exceptions to this.
    Firstly, verbs taking ""cognate objects"" are a partial exception
(Austin 1982). In Diyari, for example, six verbs take cognate objects:
'speak' (a language) 'dance' (a ceremony), 'lie', 'play' (a game), 'wear'
(clothing) and 'be painted' (a pattern). Significantly, subjects remain in
the nominative (intransitive subject) case, even though the extra NP
behaves syntactically like an object.
    Secondly, quite a few languages, such as Alawa, Djaru, and
Kalkatungu (see Blake 1987: 28-29 for references) have an alternation
                             9.2 Verbal clauses: basic argument structures   345
between basically transitive verbs and semi-transitive constructions that is
used to show goals or ""failed objects"" for a small number of verbs. In the
above three languages these alternations between ERG:ACC and NOM:DAT
frames occur with the two verbs 'see' (-> 'look for, try to see') and
 'hear' (-> 'listen for'). Luritja and Kalkatungu have similar alternations
between transitive 'find' and semitransitive 'see, try to find'. Some of the
Yolngu languages, notably Djapu (Morphy 1983) and Djinang
(Waters 1989) extend this alternation to the verbs 'hit' and 'strike',
while others, such as Djamparrpuyngu (Wilkinson 1991) do not. In all of
these languages the number of verbs with such alternations is less than
half a dozen.
    Warlpiri (Hale 1982a) and Mparntwe Arrernte (Wilkins 1989) have a
productive pattern of adding dative arguments, which denote a goal or
""failed object"" of transitive verbs. Interestingly, even here the case of the
subject is unchanged, remaining in the ergative. Cf. Warlpiri luwa-rni
 'SUBJ (ERG) shoot OBJ (ABS); SUBJ (ERG) shoot at IOBJ (DAT)'. In the
Yolngu language Djamparrpuyngu (Wilkinson 1991) the two perception
verbs 'see' and 'hear' display the same transitive/semitransitive
alternation as Kalkatungu, Djaru and Alawa, but the semitransitive
construction assigns the ergative to its subjects. In Warlpiri, Mparntwe
Arrernte and Djamparrpuyngu, then, the case assigned to the subject
remains constant through these case frame alternations.
    The third category of exceptions involves what Wilkins (1989) has
called ""cognate subjects"": verbs whose semantics narrowly determine
their possible subjects. In Warlpiri (Laughren 1987) two synonymous
verbs of this type, both meaning 'burn, cook' display an alternation
between an intransitive frame ('the meat burns/cooks') and a transitive,
ERG:ACC frame ('the fire burns/cooks the meat'). In Mparntwe Arrernte
(Wilkins 1989) two verbs display this alternation—one meaning
'cook/burn' as in Warlpiri, and another meaning '(wind:NOM) blow',
'(windrERG) blow (OBJ:ACC) around or over'.
    Fixed transitivity in ergative languages is thus a very strong tendency
rather than an exceptionless law. But it is significant that each of the
above classes of exceptions involves a small and semantically coherent
class of verbs, and that cognate object constructions in all languages
considered, and ""failed object"" constructions in some, maintain ergative
case on the subjects.
    In addition to the productivity of transitivity alternations, two other
features of Kayardild grammar further stress the relative unimportance of
transitivity as a syntactic category:
(a) As mentioned in Chapter 8, there is no requirement in Kayardild that
all verbs in a ""verb complex"" agree in transitivity. In such ergative
languages as Dyirbal (Dixon 1972: 64), Yidiny (Dixon 1977a: 252),
Ngiyambaa (Donaldson 1980) and Kalkatungu (Blake 1979b), on the
346      9 Syntax of the simple clause
other hand, transitivity-agreement within verb-complexes is strictly
required.
(b) A corollary of (a) is that Kayardild has no transitivity-sensitive
adverbal forms. Mirrayalatha 'do well', for example, may be used with
intransitives, as in mirrayalatha wirrkaja 'dance well', and with
transitives, as in mirrayalatha ngudija wangalki 'throw the boomerang
well'. In ergative Yukulta, by contrast, adverbs have transitivity-specific
forms: mirralaja wukuwa 'work well' vs watigalka mirralatha ngudi
'throw the boomerang well'. Similarly, the verbal ablative case is
transitivity-sensitive in Yukulta but not in Kayardild11 (see 4.4.2.4).
These differences between accusative Kayardild and the various ergative
Australian languages mentioned above can be explained if we accept the
arguments put forward by Mel'cuk (1979) and Goddard (1982) that most
so-called ergative languages in Australia actually have three core cases,
which Goddard labels ergative (A), nominative (S) and accusative (O).
     If transitive and intransitive verbs were mixed in a clause, they would
assign conflicting cases (usually ergative and nominative, but nominative
and accusative in a syntactically ergative language like Dyirbal) to their
subject. In an accusative language like Kayardild, on the other hand,
there are no grounds for distinguishing ergative and nominative cases,
these being joined in a single ""nominative"" case, assigned to the subjects
of transitive and intransitive verbs alike, so there can be no case clash.
    With regard to lexical argument structures, one might propose that
verb lexemes readily tolerate changes in case-assignment to non-subject
arguments, but require that their subjects always be assigned the same
case. In an accusative language the subjects of intransitive and transitive
argument structures alike will be assigned the same case (nominative); in
an ergative langage, on the other hand, transitive and intransitive
argument structures will assign their subjects different cases (A or
""ergative"", and S or ""nominative"", respectively).
    Two interesting implications emerge from the above discussion.
Firstly, clausal transitivity is far more important as a syntactic category in
ergative languages. Secondly, ergative and accusative languages differ
not only in their syntactic rules, but also in their patterns of regular verbal
polysemy, as manifested in case frame alternations.","[369, 370, 371, 372, 373]"

So strong is the association between contrasting participant sets and
complementized clauses that all pronouns may be ellipsed. The
complementizing case signals the contrast in participants and to an extent
their person, while their exact identity is left to context:(12-39)   [damuru-yiwa-thurrka](yjBL ngaka-th!
          panja-VALL-IMMED:COBL wait-IMP
          '(You) wait here while (we/they) go for panja (spike rush corms)!'
          [According to context the subordinate subject could be interpreted as first
          or third person.]
1 2 . 2 . 4 Syntactic conditions: possible generalizations
As we have seen, complementizing case is not found when the pivot is
subject of both clauses. It is found in all other cases, namely (a) when the
pivot is a subordinate non-subject, (b) when the pivot is a matrix non-
subject and (c) when the two clauses lack a common argument.
     Can these various conditions be captured in a single generalization? A
first approximation would be to require ""complementizing case""
whenever the two clauses have different subjects.
     This would be consistent with (a) to (c) above. But it fails to account
for sentences like (12-32) and (12-33) where matrix and subordinate
clauses have a common subject but still take complementizing case,
because they also have a non-subject argument in common, and this non-
subject argument is the pivot. Complementizing case here is not triggered
by comparing the identity of successive subjects, but rather by the non-
identity of subject and pivot. A related and more important drawback of
the ""different subject"" analysis is that although it mostly predicts correctly
the appearance of complementizing case, it misses the central functional
principle, which operates not by tracking subjects, but tracking pivots
and indicating whether they coincide with subjects. This could be
formulated as follows:(12-40)   In finite subordinate clauses complementizing case will apply whenever
          the pivot is not subject of both matrix and subordinate clausesIn Kayardild, the various odd-pivot conditions are not formally
distinguished. Lardil, on the other hand has developed ways of
distinguishing the four conditions Sub-Sub, Sub-Obj, Obj-Subj and
Obj-Obj. See Appendix C.
    Note that the derived subjects of passives count as subjects for the
purposes of (12-40). See, for example, (12-81).

1 2 . 2 . 5 Comparison between odd-pivot and switch-reference
            marking
It may be useful at this stage to compare Odd Pivot marking (OP) in some
detail with the related phenomenon of ""switch-reference"" (SR) marking,
which signals the identity or otherwise of successive clausal subjects. In
characterizing SR I am drawing on works by Jacobsen (1967), Austin
(1981c), Haiman—Munro (1983) and Stirling (1993); although not all
scholars would agree on the exact characteristics of SR, I believe the
following would be accepted by most as typical, particularly in Australian
languages.(a) Both are reference tracking devices. But where SR tracks arguments
in the same grammatical function, canonically subjects,5 and evaluates
their identity or otherwise, OP tracks referentially identical arguments and
evaluates their grammatical function: are they subject of both clauses?
(b) Both appear to code information about referential identity/non-identity
elsewhere than on the relevant nominal arguments themselves. The fact
that SR systems typically employ verbal suffixes (Diyari, Arrernte),
particles (e.g. in Pima; see Langdon—Munro 1979) or conjunctions
(Yankunytjatjara), while OP marking is realized by case marking over a
whole clause, is of no particular significance. Verbal suffixes, particles
and conjunctions are all classic means of coding functions with clausal
scope, and case-marking over a whole clause is another such means,
uncommon cross-linguistically but consistent with the rigorous concord
found at all levels of Kayardild syntax. The formal similarity between OP
marking and SR becomes all the more obvious when one considers that in
most Australian languages SR verbal suffixes incorporate case
inflections, at least diachronically (Austin 1981c, Dench—Evans 1988).
Although it has been asserted that SR is ""weird"" because ""it seems to
violate very general iconic tendencies whereby categories which define
properties of nouns are expressed by nominal affixes"" (Haiman 1983), I
believe it is misleading to see either SR or OP as categories limited to
particular nominal arguments.
    For one thing, the information provided by SR usually extends
beyond the identity of one argument. As Heath (1983) points out, by
knowing that clauses have identical subjects we also know that the
subordinate object, for example, is different from the main clause
subject. As we saw above, SR and OP rules give similar results for most5
    See Stirling (1993: 32ff) for a discussion of various non-canonical SR systems,
such as those in which requirements of agentivity or topicality are added to the
requirement of subjecthood.
                          12.2 Odd pivot conditions and complementizing case         505
argument combinations; this is a consequence of the multiple information
SR and OP marking both provide.
    More importantly, I believe that SR and OP should be seen as
providing information about clauses rather than nominal arguments. In a
number of languages the SR mechanism doubles to code contrasts of a
more general kind between the two clauses. In Yankunytjatjara, for
instance, the ""Contrastive Connective"" kaa is used for switch reference
but also ""where one proposition is being contrasted with another, or
when in a narrative, a surprising or exceptional development occurs""
(Goddard 1983: 296). One of the ""obviative"" or SR suffixes 6 in Warlpiri
subordinate clauses, rlajinta, ""is used to show SUBJECT control, but with
the further implication that the action described in the matrix happened as
an accidental consequence of the action described in the controlled
clause"" (Simpson—Bresnan 1983: 57). In Kayardild, too, the
appearance of OP marking occasionally seems to reflect a more general
type of contrast—see 12.2.6.3.
    The semantic similarity between these two uses of SR morphology,
and the fact that both refer to whole clauses, may be shown by the
following approximate paraphrases. The ""surprise/contrast"" meaning
could be expressed as ""(in this clause) something happened that one
would not expect, knowing what I've been talking about just now"". And
the ""different subject"" meaning as: ""(in this clause) I say something about
someone whom one would not expect, knowing whom I've been talking
about just now"". This second meaning, framed with SR in mind, is also
suitable for OP marking.
    On the analysis proposed here, then, the fact that both SR and OP
systems employ syntactic means having clausal scope is iconic, as SR
and OP provide information primarily about clauses and only secondarily
about particular arguments. By marking all words of the affected clause,
Kayardild expresses this iconicity in full.","[529, 530, 531, 532]"
"1.6     The Kayardild language today
1.6.1      The linguistic milieu
The Kayardild language is being abandoned in favour of English with
frightening rapidity, so that within less than forty-five years of
substantial European contact there are no fully fluent speakers under
fifty. Before we can understand this phenomenon, we must understand
the overall linguistic and social position on Mornington Island. There are
basically four groups of people on Mornington:(a) The L A R D I L , who are the traditional owners and residents, and
number about 500. Mission contact since 1919, and in particular the
infamous ""dormitory system"" that operated till the early 1950s, has
severely reduced the number of speakers of Lardil. A full profile of the
varieties of Lardil spoken by different age groups is impossible here, but
the following oversimplified picture will give the reader some idea.
    Perhaps five old people still speak Lardil fluently, but even they
mostly use English. Those from forty-five to seventy know quite a bit of
Lardil, often including a number of traditional songs, but their grammar
is simplified, their vocabulary restricted, and language mixing is
frequent: a typical utterance, combining Lardil, English and pidgin
elements is hey thabu, I never savvy your binngen bin waa! 'hey
brother, I didn't know your wife had gone'. For those below thirty
knowledge of Lardil is restricted to a few formulaic expressions like
kunaatha 'goodbye' and nyingki waa 'hello', basic lexicon (some kin
and body part terms, taboo words like dulda 'shit', and some plant,
animal and fish names), plus swear words like ngamadaan           'mother
fucker'. As contacts with Kriol 33 -speaking groups to the west increases,
33
    Kriol is the generally-accepted term for a creolized variety of English, showing
heavy substrate influence from Aboriginal languages, that is spoken by perhaps
44      1 The language and its speakers
Kriol is having an increasing influence on the English of younger
speakers. The types of English spoken by these various groups are
summarized in Table 1-4 34 .(b) About 100 ""MAINLANDERS""—Aborigines who have come to
Mornington from a number of places, especially Ganggalida (Yukulta),
Garawa and Waanyi people from the adjoining mainland, and Wik
Mungkan from Aurukun. Although some of these people still know
traditional Aboriginal languages (particularly the Aurukun people), the
internal fragmentation of this group, the small number of speakers of
each language, their relative Europeanization (most paid jobs not held by
Europeans are held by ""mainlanders"") and perhaps their remoteness
from their traditional territory, mean that the traditional languages of this
group are peripheral to the linguistic network of Mornington Island.
Most speak a form of Aboriginal English relatively close to Standard
Australian English; with Mornington Aborigines they use ""Mornington
English"".(c) About 1 0 0 EUROPEANS, who hold most of the paid jobs, wealth and
power. All speak Standard Australian English; none speaks any
Aboriginal language fluently, although most know a few of the Lardil
words that have become part of Mornington English.(d) The 1 5 0 KAIADILT, minus those residing on Bentinck Island and on
the mainland at a given time. Those over 60 speak fluent Kayardild; with
non-Kaiadilt they may use some English or Pidgin words. Those
between 35 and 60 speak Kayardild with varying degrees of fluency, but
are more at home in English, if younger, and a mixture of Kayardild and
Pidgin, if older. The main activity domains where Kayardild is used are
hunting, navigation, food gathering, scolding, swearing and joking.","[70, 71]"
"    The Yukulta dative forms were presumably also used for the subjects
of clauses complementized with the dative case (12.6.1). This would
have given rise to the Kayardild ""subject oblique"" use, which is the only
place these forms still appear in modern K.
    For other OBLique functions the pT dative has been replaced in
modem Κ by the OBLique suffixed to the possessive pronoun stem, as in:(5-20)     dathin-a     wanku         baa-nyarra       ngijin-inj

"1.4     The Tangkic family in Australian perspective
1.4.1     Overview of the Australian phylum
The consensus among most Australianists today is that all Australian
languages are related, but at such a remote time depth that it will be
possible to reconstruct ""proto-Australian"" only sketchily—probably the
main outlines of the phonological system and pronominal morphology,
possibly an ancestral noun class system, and a few score lexical items.
Because of the remoteness of their connection many prefer to use the
term ""Australian phylum"" rather than ""Australian family"". It is worth
bearing in mind that the most conservative dates for the human
occupation of Australia are now more than forty thousand years.
Although there is no guarantee that modern Australian languages
descend from those of the original colonizers, the possibility at least
exists that Australian languages have had an extremely long time during
which to diverge genetically.
    Since the seminal classification of O'Grady—Wurm—Hale (1966),
which proposed twenty-nine family-level groupings, there has been
substantial comparative work on the nature, identity and number of these
groupings, leading to a number of lumpings and reclassifications, but it
seems unlikely that the number of language families will ever be reduced
to much below ten. My own interpretation of our current understanding
of the genetic picture is shown in Map 3.
    Within the Australian phylum there is a concentration of genetic
diversity in the north and north-west of the continent, where a large
number of coordinate family-level groupings are found. The remaining
seven-eighths of the continent is covered by the numerous members of
the Pama-Nyungan family, whose relative similarity suggests a
28      1 The language and its speakers
time-depth of four to five millenia. The genetically diverse languages of
the north and north-west are collectively known as ""non-Pama-
Nyungan"".
    There is no evidence that the complete set of non-Pama-Nyungan
languages form a genetic entity opposed to Pama-Nyungan, and
although many share similarities in pronominal forms (Blake 1988) these
are probably shared retentions from proto-Australian.
    On the other hand, there is growing morphological evidence for an
intermediate-level subgrouping we may term the ""Arnhem Family"",
which will probably include most of the non-Pama-Nyungan languages
of Arnhem Land, subsuming the Gunwinyguan, Burarran, Iwaidjan,
and Maran groups as well as several languages hitherto classified as
isolates such as Umbugarla, Gagudju, Mangarrayi and Nunggubuyu.
    Evidence for an intermediate-level ""Arnhem family"" comes from
shared irregularities in noun class systems (Heath 1987, Evans in prep),
in verbal morphology (Alpher—Evans—Harvey to appear; Green to
appear) and lexicon. Within this grouping it may be possible to
recognize a further subgroup, which we may call ""core Arnhem"", on the
basis of certain regularities in pronominal morphology. Some of this
evidence will be discussed below in connection with the genetic position
of Tangkic.
    The Pama-Nyungan family was first proposed in 1966 by O'Grady,
Wurm and Hale on lexico-statistical grounds, but it has taken another
twenty-five years for substantial comparative evidence to establish its
genetic reality convincingly; in the process there have been a number of
revisions to its membership. The main diagnostic features of Pama-
Nyungan are     (a) a distinctive set of pronouns, set out by Blake (1988).
     (b) laminalization (to lamino-dentals or lamino-palatals) of inherited
         apicals in word-initial position (Evans 1988).
     (c) distinctive case forms for the ergative/instrumental (-rjku - - lu), and
         locative (-rjlca - -la).
     (d) a set of conjugationally distinct verbal suffixes and other verb stem
         augments (Dixon 1980 1 8 , Alpher 1990).","[54, 55]"
"Often such constructions involve successive restriction of reference: the
speaker may begin with a more general referring expression, decide the
hearer has not yet identified the referent successfully, then give a more
specific expression. The first NP is typically very general—e.g. a pronoun
or generic noun—while the second is more specific. There is no
requirement that such apposed NPs be contiguous:

                                Verbals7.1   Introduction
The morphological class of verbals includes three functional types: verbs
proper, which function as predicators (e.g. raaja 'spear'), adverbals,
which only occur together with a main verb (e.g. bakiija 'all S do, do to
all O'), and verbal cases, which function like cases, attaching to each
subconstituent of a NP. Despite their functional differences, these three
types have identical possibilities for inflection and verb-verb derivation.
    All verbals, regardless of function, belong to either of two
conjugations, ""dental"" or ""palatal"" (7.2.1). Conjugation membership is
largely determined phonologically (7.2.4).
    We begin this chapter by discussing the functional relationships
between verbal inflection, the systems of modal and verbal case, and the
preverbal clitics and particles that may mark tense/mood. In 7.1.2 we
summarize the structure of the verbal word; then in 7.2 the form and
function of each verbal inflection is presented in detail. In 7.3 I attempt a
reconstruction of the proto Tangkic system of verb inflections, arguing
that all but the imperative and desiderative derive historically from
nominalizations inflected for case. We then turn to the various verb-verb
(7.4) and nominal-verb (7.5) derivations, certain nominal suffixes that
may follow the verb inflection (7.6), verbal reduplication (7.7), and
nominal prefixation (7.8).","[278, 279]"
"12.6    The evolution of complementizing case
The peculiar Kayardild system of ""Odd Pivot"" marking appears to have
evolved from an original system based on case agreement with the main
clause antecedent NP. Under this system, preserved in Yukulta,
subordinate clauses can be left unmarked, or further marked with one of
two outer complementizing cases: the ergative (CERG) or the DATive
(CDAT). The first is cognate with the Kayardild Complementizing
LOCative, the second with the complementizing OBLique. As in
Kayardild, these suffixes appear on every word of the subordinate
clause.
                                 12.6 The evolution of complementizing case    5431 2 . 6 . 1 Complementizing case in Yukulta
Although the forms, domains, and word-positions are identical, the
conditions governing the use of complementizing case in Yukulta differ
radically from those in Kayardild. The basic principle is antecedent
agreement, using an A/S pivot in the subordinate clause. This correlates
with the accusative morphology of subordinate, as opposed to main,
clauses. See 10.4.
    When the antecedent is a matrix S or Ο (i.e. in the unmarked
ABSolutive case), the subordinate clause is unmarked:15(12-137)   dii-ja=thayi          [maka-thurlu]

     To avoid confusion with the inner layer of complementizing case in Yukulta,
which marks relative tense/mood (see 10.4.1.3), only the outer, reference-tracking
layer of case will be shown. Verb inflections will not be decomposed into thematic
