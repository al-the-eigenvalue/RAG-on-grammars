"Examples such as this are exceptional; there are only two such cases in my database, bothof which involve the word kupe ‘non-Indian’.1

    Another possibility is that there may have been some translation inadequacy for these two isolated cases.

       Noun modification is also expressed by noun phrases consisting of a noun and anonfinite verb form. In these cases, the nonfinite verb is the head of the noun phrase,which derives from a verbal predicate construction, whereas the other nominal involvedserves as the modifier (6). That the nonfinite verb is part of a noun phrase isdemonstrable by its distribution and its function in the clause: it is surrounded by a nounand the definite article ja, and it is an argument of the main predicator (6.b). Note thatthe relational prefix occurs, since the head of the noun phrase, ire, begins in a vowel; thepattern is comparable to that of the genitive construction introduced above.

       Noun modification may also involve the presence of a descriptive verb inattributive function in the noun phrase, in a relative clause construction. In this case, thedescriptive is the modifier element and follows the head noun (see details onrelativization in section V.2). Notice one such complex noun phrase as the object of theinstrumental postposition  in (7.c).

Determiners. In phrases where the head noun co-occurs with a determiner, the head doesnot appear phrase finally, since determinants are positional clitics that necessarily followthe nominal element they refer to. Determiners include the definite articles ja ‘singular’and je ‘collective’, and the indefinite article õ ‘some; a; one’ (8).2 Demonstrativepronouns also fall in this functional and distributional category, following the head noun(9).

         The indefinite marker õ may operate as a pronoun and thus head a noun phrase onits own. That is also true of the demonstratives and the singular definite article ja (10).","[215, 216, 217, 218]"

1.   ComplementationThe examples of complementation existing in my database consist of clausalcomplements occupying positions other than that of a sentence subject. Additionally, theoverwhelming majority of complement-taking predicators are of the noncanonicalmarking type, most often involving the use of the dative postposition m. These may bemere coincidences; however, there has been at least one instance in which I tried to elicita sentence that included a clausal complement in subject position, and speakers offeredparatactic clauses, instead.
                                                                                              277
       As already mentioned, the use of subordination for the expression ofcomplementation requires that the subordinate verb be in its nonfinite form. Thesubordinate clause occupies some position between the matrix verb, which occurs in finalposition, and the positional clitics normally occupying sentence-initial position. Sincethe complement-taking verbs noted all involve the use of a postposition for marking oneof the core arguments (which could be either A or O, depending on the verb), it is oftenthe case that the clausal complement will be immediately preceded by this case marker,when A is the noncanonically marked argument.","[290, 291]"
"       It has been noted, for instance, that the negative clitics not only require suchmorphology, but display a morphological make up that may be seen as evidence for averbal diachronic origin, namely, the consonant k-, analyzed here as a reflex of the thirdperson accusative prefix. Other factors that have been considered are its clause-finalposition and its possiblity of occurrence with the clitic ne. The presence of this cliticsuggests an affinity of the form ket with the class of descriptive verbs, in that some ofthem often co-occur with the morpheme ne. These are simple observations, however, andneed to be further investigated.
                                                                                                     298
        The morphosyntactic and distributional facts about the negative morphemessuggest that they may have all originated diachronically from verbal sources. At least inregard to the morpheme ket, a plausible hypothesis is that it must have started out as amonosyllabic negative predicator of tV structure, and that the kV- syllable is a reflex ofthe accusative prefix ku-, also noted in other function words, such as kumrc ‘INTS’ andkt ‘3.ERG’, among others (see chapter IV). The hypothetical predicator *tV must havebeen responsible for the negation of the proposition described in the clause, thusrequiring the nonfinite form of the subordinate verb; whereas the morpheme ku- couldhave operated as an anaphoric/resumptive pronoun, referring back to the negatedproposition. Verbs do take noun phrases as arguments; and it is quite possible that thedistribution of ku- was restricted to cases of propositional, not nominal, negation in a paststage of Apinajé.1 However, since the most frequent scope of negation is the proposition,the use of the *kVtV form may have become more standardized, leading to its reanalysisas the negative stem of Apinajé thus replacing other related forms elsewhere in thegrammar. As far as phonological changes, one could speculate a path such as *kute >*kete > ket, for Apinajé, with vowel harmony and eventual deletion of the stem finalvowel. In any case, it is no longer possible to speak of ket and ketne as true verbs in1
  In Kaingang (Southern Jê), one of the negative markers is indeed a monosyllabic morpheme beginning in
/t/: tõ ‘NEG’ (Wiesemann 1986). However, in that language this form of the negative is employed in narrow
scope negation, specifically, in the negation of nouns; sentential negation is expressed by a similar ket
morpheme. (Thanks to Eduardo Ribeiro for calling my attention to this piece of data, in personal
communication.)

Apinajé. These morphemes have now become positional clitics which do not display thefull morphosyntactic behavior and semantic content of a lexical verb.","[311, 312, 313]"
"       Noncanonical marking in Apinajé is noticeable with verbs of cognition, emotion,utterance, and sensation, among others. The patterns observed with these verbs all departfrom the basic canonical patterns of argument marking and involve many sorts ofpostpositions – from locative, to dative, to instrumental to ergative. The semantic sub-categorization of such predicators corresponds somewhat to the kinds of postpositionsused, but not necessarily so.
                                                                                                       233
Notionally monovalent non-canonical predicators. Most (notional) monovalent non-canonical predicators (and I say “predicators,” rather than “verbs,” because some of theseare based on nouns4) have their sole participant marked with the dative postposition,although there is one verb, ami kati ‘have fun; enjoy oneself’, which calls for thereflexive pronoun.

 That the elements involved are nouns, and not simply the result of conversion of nouns into verbs, can be
seen from morphological differences between the members of a pair, for instance, as in akr ‘be cold’ as
compared to kr ‘cold (?)’; another example is t- go [RP-LOC water] ‘sweat’, as against  ‘LOC’ and go
‘water’.

         At a closer look, one could hypothesize that the predicator in these cases may betaking a zero third person marker, in which case the predicator could not be adequatelydescibed as monovalent. The difficulty with confirming this hypothesis is that, in somecases, a regular verb adopts an alternative form which is specific to this kind ofpredication. Take the example of m kr ‘feel cold’: elsewhere, the form of the predicatoris akr ‘be.cold’, which may take person inflection, thus also employing the relationalprefix j-. In the case of a zero third person form, the relational prefix would not occur; butthe formative a- would not be lost either. Therefore, the best criteria for deciding whetherthese are mono- or bivalent predicators, and even whether the participants marked withpostpositions are or are not core arguments, must come from syntax. For the time being,I will simply lay out the morphological patterns involved, and will postpone a discussionof the syntactic evidence until section 4.
                                                                                          235
Bivalent non-canonical predicators. Bivalent non-canonical predicators come in avariety of patterns. The primary difference between the patterns is whether A or O isnoncanonically marked, and secondarily whether we should think of some of these asextended intransitives rather than noncanonical transitives. We begin with two clearcases of noncanonical A: some verbs require that the A be marked as a dative, others thatit be marked as ergative.","[246, 247, 248, 249]"
"        The word ja has the primary function of a definite article within a noun phrase;muj and atar are demonstratives that operate either as full pronouns or as determiners ofthe noun. The present section focuses on the pronominal role of these markers. Fordetails about their function, distribution, and morphological properties within the nounphrase, see section IV.2.1. The forms ictar and mutar are used mostly as locatives and arenot discussed here.",[179]
"       Dixon and Aikhenvald call attention to the fact that a phonological word – or, theword as defined by its phonological properties – in a given language, may or may notcoincide with a grammatical word in the same language. Thus, a grammatical word mayconsist of more than one phonological word or, likewise, a phonological word mayconsist of more than one grammatical word. In the first case, they cite the example ofYimas (Foley 1991: 86, cited in Dixon and Aikhenvald 2002), in which compounds(grammatical words) are composed of more than one phonological word (theparticipating nouns), in that they bear individual primary stresses. As an illustration ofthe second case, they cite examples of one positional clitic in Dyirbal (p. 27-28).",[103]
"That is so because b is the second argument of the verb are, and accordingly, it occursimmediately preposed to the verb, which takes the relational prefix; the same is true of di‘woman’ in (6.c), the S argument of the verb ca ‘stand’. In (6.c-d), on the other hand, therelativized element di ‘woman’ is the A argument of are ‘tell’. The external relativestrategy applies in this case, with the restrictive clause following the head noun. Notice in(6.d) the presence of the third person ergative marker kt inside the subordinate clause;the ergative case marker is coreferential with the external head noun and serves as aresumptive pronoun.

        The examples in (7-9) further illustrate the point. In (8), the relativized element isthe dative participant, which also occurs internally in the relative clause. Thus theinstances in which externally headed relative clauses occur include mostly cases ofergative relativization, but are not limited to this. For instance, consider (9.b), where thesecond argument of the verb, mekdc ‘medication’, appears in initial position in thesentence. Inside the relative clause, the subordinate verb appears without the relationalprefix, since its object is not contiguous to it. Examples of this kind were not veryfrequent during elicitation sessions. It is possible that this fronting of the object of the RCis a pragmatic strategy for placing it under focus, in which case this construction wouldbe more marked than those in which the relativized object occurs internal to the relativeclause. It is also possible that this is all artefacts of elicitation; further (textual) examplesare still needed for clarification of this point.

         Strategies for case-recovery in Apinajé relativization are the use of resumptivepronouns, which are zero in many cases, but which may also come attached to theergative marker (or expressed by its suppletive form, in the case of the third person).","[296, 297, 298]"

Verbs are subcategorized morphosyntactically into transitives, intransitivesand descriptives, displaying a split intransitivity system with respect to verbal person-marking. Word order is predominantly SOV. Syntactically complex constructionsinclude verb serialization and clause subordination, with ergative case-marking acharacteristic of subordinate clauses.

"           A brief examination of data from Apinajé, Suyá, Kayapó and Timbira may reveal the many differences (e.g. prenasalized stops, nominative case-marking in independent clauses) and similarities (e.g. simple morphology, SOV word order, ergative marking in subordinate clauses) existing among them. Panará, on the other hand, is dramatically distinct from the other languages of the branch. It displays a more polysynthetic morphological typology, with agent, patient and tense/aspect/modality (TAM) marking on the verb; ergative marking in independent clauses and SVO word order, among other things.18

     The area is known in Brazil as “Bico do Papagaio” (‘the parrot’s beak’).
17
   In an interview on this subject, an Apinajé speaker declared his total lack of familiarity with the latter
terms. Most interesting in this case would be to check on the word for ‘tip, corner’ in any of the Timbira
languages.
18
 Data examined are from Alves (2002), Timbira Apanjekrá; Reis Silva (2003) and Salanova (2001),
Mebengokre Kayapó; Santos (2004), Suyá; and Dourado (2001), Panará.

       The Apinajé are considered, in the anthropological literature, a Western divisionof the Timbira, living west of the Tocantins. Eastern Timbira peoples are thosedistributed at various locations in the States of Maranhão and Tocantins, east of the river(Nimuendajú 1983; Da Matta 1982). In linguistic classifications, on the other hand, it isnot uncommon for an Apinajé-Kayapó grouping to be contrasted with the Timbiradialectal cluster (Davis 1966; 1968). Be that as it may, the conclusion in both fields isthat the Apinajé constitute an autonomous group and language, distinct from bothKayapó and Timbira.","[41, 42]"
"Relational prefixes, as already mentioned, indicate distributional contiguity and syntacticconstituency between the elements of the phrase. When such contiguity is breached, therelevant argument is understood as being under focus, as it occurs elsewhere in theclause. In the case of transitive, monosyllabic predicators, an argument under focus isreplaced in the verb phrase by the third person accusative prefix ku-, which serves as aresumptive pronoun (35-36).

       The other possibility is that the relevant noun phrase argument may occurelsewhere in the discourse, in which case the accusative prefix serves as an anaphoricpronoun. Note also that the zero third person prefix occurs, when distributionalrestrictions prevent the occurrence of ku-.","[233, 234]"
"       As pointed out earlier, the number clitics wa and m generally precede the nounphrase they modify, follow the pronoun they modify, and precede the verb whose boundprefix they modify. In these conjunction examples, the first impulse might be to assumethat they modify the preceding noun phrase, which would be structurally odd. However,
                                                                                           211
this is not the case: the realis clitic na marks the right boundary of the conjoined S/A nounphrase in (17.b-c), leaving wa to serve as a resumptive pronoun.","[224, 225]"
"       When a conjoined noun phrase is in O function, the resumptive pronoun slot is notavailable. In this case, wa can occur only as a modifier of the third person form of theverb (18.a), in which case the O noun phrase is not within the verb phrase, but stands as apreverbal adjunct. The attempt to force an analysis with wa as a post-NP modifier fails,as seen in (18.b): wa cannot be interpreted as the dual marker when it comes between theconjoined noun phrase and a transitive verb bearing a relational prefix (indicatingcontiguity with its O argument). Here, wa can only be interpreted as the homophonousnoun ‘tooth’, and the conjoined noun phrase must be its possessor.

       The same observations regarding the use of the realis and the dual markers arevalid for the examples involving the expression (ne) kacw, which has the samedistribution in the noun phrase as the plain conjunction ne in the examples above. Noticethat, here too, the dual marker may be dispensed with, when the coordinates constitutethe O argument of the verb (19.d). The morpheme kacw can also function as aninchoative marker in a different type of construction (section V.4).

       The examples in (20) illustrate the use of the associative marker me, whichfollows the same general pattern noted above. One interesting fact about this morphemeis that it serves as the basis for the numeral ametkrut ‘two’. The use of ame as a numeralresults in different distribution from its use as the associative (20.c). It appears as acommon modifier of the coordinates, thus closing the higher noun phrase, which is againnot contiguous to its predicator.

       ‘I saw your husband and your child, the two of them.’
       Notice that (20.a) is a counterexample to the analysis proposed here, that thecoordination of S/A noun phrases must be mediated by the realis marker. The examples in(21), on the other hand, not only confirm the analysis, they also show that, without therealis marker, the clause is grammatically unacceptable, a fact that reinforces the idea thatcoordinate noun phrases in Apinajé are somewhat emphasized because of the verysyntactic construction in which they appear. In face of the evidence, however, it appearsthat the analysis will have to be reajusted to include the possibility that position andmovement intransitives may, in fact, allow for the lack of the realis marker. Furtherresearch will be necessary to clarify this point.

       The strategies for noun phrase coordination presented in (17-21) all indicate thatthe referents performed actions, underwent changes-of-state or participated in eventstogether, as a party. Another coordination strategy, one that employs the noun acw j

‘likewise’, indicates that the referents of each noun phrase performed the same actions,participated in the same events or underwent the same states, but they did soindependently from one another. Further details about this construction are in section 2.3.","[225, 226, 227, 228]"
"       On the other hand, Direct Object is a less robust grammatical relation in thelanguage. The O argument forms a tight constituent with the following verb, and if the Odoes not occur as a free form, then a personal prefix on the verb must index the person ofO. In addition to this morphosyntactic pattern, the accusative prefix set contains a uniqueform, the prefix ku-, which is the one criterion that unquestionably identifies the DirectObject. Note that these criteria only identify the canonical O as Direct Object, leaving nosyntactic or morphological evidence for the combination of the canonical O category withthe many proposed noncanonical O arguments: these latter bear case-markers, cannot beindexed on the verb, and show no evidence of constituency with the V. As such, we pushthem to the next category, that of Indirect Object.",[269]

The study is based on originaldata collected by the author in various trips to the field between October 1995 andAugust 2000, as well as in interviews with speakers of the language in the city ofGoiânia, Goiás State, Brazil. Rather than a definite account of the language, this work isintended as the kernel of what will evolve into a more comprehensive grammar as furtheranalysis is conducted; for the time being, my main goal is to lay out as many patterns ascan possibly be distilled from the available data, regarding the phonology, morphology,lexicon, and syntax of the language. From a broader perspective, I hope this study willserve as an effective source for historical-comparative work aiming at the reconstructionof the Jê linguistic family, and thus constitute an additional piece for the betterunderstanding of the Macro-Jê stock, a still hypothetical classification for a number oflittle-documented South American languages.","[9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]"

       Thus, the structure of simple clauses in Apinajé betrays a combination of splitintransitivity and nominative alignment patterns – all this relative to agreement and cross-referencing, however. It is only in the context of subordination that ergativity is overtlyexpressed by case markers (see chapter V). These patterns comprise the canonicalmarking of arguments in Apinajé verbal clauses.","[243, 244]"
"It may occur in predicate position (95.a), or modifying predicates, in which case it mayitself be modified by the additional intensifier kumrc (95.b-c) The use of tc withdescriptive predicates implies a reading in which the predicator encodes a transitional ortemporary condition or state (95.d), and in this respect it contrasts with ru ‘plenty;grand’and raci ‘large’.

        This morpheme is transparently related to itc ‘be strong’, which is a descriptivestem in all respects: it inflects for person, in which case it takes the relational prefix c-;and operates as a predicator, though it may be a noun modifier, as other descriptives.","[167, 168]"
"       The ergative markers t and kt must have evolved from a nominal source. Myclaim is based on their distribution in the sentence and their function in present-dayApinajé syntax, as case markers of nominal elements. However, the possibility that theprefix ku- may have participated in the development of the suppletive third-person formof the ergative is also present here – a path that I propose for the other two postpositionsthat display suppletive forms, namely, the detrimentive and the dative, as well. Thehypothesis is displayed schematically below:
(1)            *ku-m        >       k-m >       km     ‘3.DAT’
               *ku-pe         >       ke-pe >        kep     ‘3.DTR’
               *ku-t         >       k-t >        kt     ‘3.ERG’
       The idea proposed in (1) is that all three postpositional markers may once havebeen used with the third person prefix ku. With the frequency of use, the vowels involvedunderwent certain phonological changes, such that non-low vowels ended up in fullharmony, whereas in the environment of a low vowel, only partial asimilation took place,
                                                                                              300
such that the high back vowel became lowered. Eventually, all word-final vowels werelost, giving way to a heavy monosyllabic word.","[313, 314]"
"Notice that only the realis form of pronouns participates in this strategy.

       Although it is frequently true that the same pronoun is presented twice in theclause – once for focus and once as the nominative –, as shown in (104), that is notnecessarily the case: the pronoun/referent in focus position may be distinct from that innominative position (105).","[174, 175]"
"       If Direct Object in Apinajé is not particularly robust, the evidence in favor of thegrammatical relation Indirect Object is limited to a single criterion: obligatoriness. In thetraditional ditransitive predicates, the third argument bears the dative case-marking, andin the various noncanonical verb types seen in section 3.3.2, the second argument bearsone of four different case-markers, lexically determined by the verb. Thus, the categoryof Indirect Object could be defined as those obligatory arguments that otherwise have nomorphological or syntactic patterns to unite them.
                                                                                                256
          The criteria listed above for subjects are further discussed and illustrated in thenext sections.","[269, 270]"
"4.2. ImperativesIn imperative clauses, bound person inflection also displays a nominative pattern, in whatseems to be a unique occurrence of this pattern for person marking in Apinajé (85-87). In(85.a), the O argument of the verb is overtly expressed, forming a phrase with it. In(85.b), the O argument is not overtly mentioned, in which case, the verb inflects for A.",[271]
"       The verbs that require a dative A include verbs of liking, disliking, refusal, fear,and desire. The latter three occur as complement-taking verbs as well, as may be seen inthe examples. The clause begins with the nominative pronoun in first or second position,followed a bit later by a coreferential dative-marked A argument; the O follows thecanonical pattern, either occurring as a noun phrase immediately adjacent to the verb, orindicated morphologically with bound pronouns ((51-52); O-NP’s are within brackets).",[249]
"
2.2. Postpositional phraseThe structure of postpositional phrases is quite consistent regardless of themorphosyntactic properties of the noun phrases involved. Vowel-initial postpositionsrequire relational prefixes, as usual. Objects of postpositions may be simplex nounphrases, coordinated noun phrases and nonfinite clauses (22-24).

        Complex noun phrases, namely, those including relative clauses, may havepostpositions but are not directly headed by the postposition; in these cases, a person

Of the determiners found in noun phrases, only demonstrative pronounsmay replace the noun phrase headed by a postposition. Otherwise, in the absence of afull noun phrase, it is a person prefix or the reflexive or reciprocal clitics that attach to thepostposition, serving as cross-reference markers (26).

Quantifiers. The plural and dual clitics may each co-occur with a postposition that isinflected for person. In this case, the quantifier clitic is actually modifying the (referentof the) person prefix attached to the postposition, and occurs preposed to it. Mostpostpositions take a zero prefix for third person; others have irregular third person forms(see diachronic hypothesis in section III.3.1.3). In these cases, the quantifier occurspreposed to the postposition itself (27).
                                                                                           216(27) a. me     Ø-kot                          ‘after them’

Clausal objects. A few select postpositions may perform a more grammatical functionwhen taking a clause as their objects. One such example is the dative postposition m,which may encode notions of future or purpose action as illustrated in (28).

Postpositional phrase coordination. The coordination of postpositional phrases seemsmore restricted in possibilities than plain noun phrase coordination. The conjunctionused is the associative marker me. The examples in (29) show structural distinctions thathave to do with whether one of the coordinates is a speech-act participant. If so, it will beexpressed as a person prefix on the postposition, which results in non-contiguity betweenthe (notional) coordinates, since the two nominal elements are separated by the
                                                                                              217
associative and the dual marker (29.a). That is not exactly what could be calledcoordination, though the combination of dual marker and first person prefix encodes firstperson exclusive, and the other participant is clearly indicated by the associative markerme. In (29.b), on the other hand, the two third person objects are expressed by overt nounphrases linked by the associative marker.

          The unacceptable examples in (30) show that the presence of the dual marker wais necessary, and that it mediates the relation between the coordinate noun phrases andthe postposition that heads the higher phrase. In other words, there is no coordination ofpostpositional phrases as such; instead, there is either noun phrase or clause coordination(31).

2.3. Verb phraseVerbs phrases in Apinajé follow an absolutive pattern with regard to which argumentcooccurs with the verb inside the phrase. That is predictable according to themorphosyntactic class of the predicator that heads the phrase – either (di)transitive ordescriptive (32-34). Verb phrases headed by intransitive verbs do not include any type ofnoun phrase, in main clauses. In dependent clauses, they follow the same pattern asdescriptives, that is, they have their S argument overtly expressed in the verb phrase (34).","[228, 229, 230, 231, 232]"

"       In the analysis of Apinajé, I share Matthew Dryer’s view that the grammaticalrelations of a language are specific to that language and may be defined according tolanguage internal criteria. In section 3.3 I have pointed out how distinct systems ofalignment interact in Apinajé. Thus, coding patterns and control properties relevant forthe establishment of grammatical relations in Apinajé include:(82) Relevant criteria for the establishment of grammatical relations in Apinajé   (a) word order
   (b) person prefixes
   (c) independent pronouns
   (d) person inflection in imperative clauses
   (e) the use of reflexives
   (f) the occurrence of the realis marker in noun phrase coordination
   (g) switch-reference strategies
   (h) valency-changing operations
   (i) ergative marking in subordinate clauses
   (j) equi-deletion in complementation
   (k) coreferential deletion in coordination
       The SOV word order (criterion (a)) is fairly rigid in Apinajé and serves as a usefulcriterion of the identification of A and O. The use of person prefixes (b) reveals a split-

Similitive acwj. The postposition acwj ‘likewise; too’ is a category that pertainsstructurally to the noun phrase, being thus a counterpart of mnen ‘also; likewise’, whichis an adverbial element that operates at the clause level (section IV.2.3). This postpositiontakes the relational prefix j- and interacts with the switch-reference system of Apinajé ininteresting ways.

Relator nouns. Apinajé makes extensive use of relator nouns to express more detailednuances of space relations. Most of the instances found in the corpus also involve the useof postpositions, resulting in fixed, compound expressions where specific postpositionsand relator nouns associate. The inventory of postpositions noted in these cases is broad,although it seems to exclude the associative me, the allative wr, and the ablative rum.","[161, 162]"
"Among all postpositions, the dative frequently allows for phonological truncation, beingrealized simply as a bilabial nasal consonant in word-final position. In this case, thestress of the reflexive clitic is the relevant one in the phonological word. Compare(129.a-b).

         Reciprocity also targets obliques, as illustrated in (130), as well as the secondargument of noncanonical verbs (section IV.3.3.2.). Notice that the number particleapplies to the reciprocal marker in the same way as it does with other pronouns (131-132).","[190, 191]"
"       In the morphological causative, the lexical verb then turns out to have the samedistribution relative to  as the manner adverb in a given clause; but that does notnecessarily make an adverb out of it: the fact that the lexical verb shares an argumentwith  and that the latter has a very generic meaning makes it easier for  to becomereinterpreted as belonging to a distinct category − a derivational morpheme, in the case athand − than for the lexical verb to be reinterpreted as a manner adverb.

         Criteria (h-j) for the establishment of Apinajé grammatical relations involve othercomplex constructions. Of these criteria, equi-deletion follows a nominative patternwhile subordination requires ergative case-marking. In coordination, coreferentialdeletion varies according to whether the verbs involved are transitive or descriptive.","[280, 281]"
"        One set of nouns includes prefixes that occur more productively in verbs, namely,the middle prefixes (a-, aw-, am-; see section 3.1.2.4). When attached to verbs, theseprefixes typically result in detransitivization of the base. A similar result holds withnouns, in that the valency of the noun may also be reduced: inalienable nouns becomealienable after the derivation (44.a). There is one instance in which the opposite is true,with the derivation departing from an alienable noun (44.b). Other cases involve the useof verbal roots as bases, a role that may be performed by transitive, intransitive ordescriptive verbs (44.c-d). Sequences of morphemes belonging to the “middleinventory,” such as aw- and am-, apply to these verbal bases for noun derivation.

"        The fact that some of these core arguments will be marked with adpositions orcase-marking certainly makes it hard to decide whether the participant in question is infact a core argument of the verb. Thus, as Onishi wisely points out, “both morphologicaland syntactic criteria [are necessary] to determine which arguments should be regarded asA, S, O and E” (p.2).
                                                                                         232
       The noncanonical marking of core arguments is understood here, with Onishi(2001), as those patterns that deviate from the standard patterns of argument markingused in a given language. In the case of Apinajé, the canonical pattern is the use of freepronouns to indicate SA/SO/A (nominative pattern), and bound person markers to indicateSO/O (absolutive pattern). Noncanonical marking in Apinajé then involves the use ofvarious postpositions for the expression of what appear to be core arguments, that is,participants that are obligatorily required by verbs.","[245, 246]"
"Certain properties commonly found in subordinating constructions, such as the use of thenonfinite form of verbs, are also necessarily employed in the expression the comparativeof superiority and one type of inchoative construction. The structural properties observedin the latter cases, which are typologically less common, are crystallized and presumablyresult from the diachronic development of source biclausal constructions, in which themodern main verb was subordinate and the modern postverbal particle was the main verb.",[288]

Genitive õ. The genitive marker õ behaves very much like other postpositions ofApinajé.

            ‘My beans are inside my covered pan.’           Traditionally, the marker of alienable possession o has been analyzed in many Jêlanguages as the noun for ‘thing’ (cf. e.g. Ribeiro (2004) and references therein). Eventhough this may be true from a diachronic point of view, evidence indicates thatsynchronically this is not the case in Apinajé. This morpheme õ – not to be confused withthe indefinite article õ – is limited in distribution to genitive constructions: it does notoccur anywhere as an independent lexical item. In addition, there are other words thatpresently encode the meaning ‘thing’: bj ‘thing’ and kukre ‘belongings’ (76.a-b).

Dative m. The dative postposition m also indicates the benefactive and may operate asallative or locative, as is crosslinguistically common. Besides occurring with nounphrases, the dative postposition is also used as a subordinator in purpose clauses (sectionIV.2.2).

        The third person form of this marker presents a morphological peculiarity,however.     If the referent is expressed by a full noun phrase, then the postpositionmaintains its bare form and co-occurs with the noun, which is in consonance with thebehavior of other postpositions (77.a). On the other hand, with a pronominal third personreferent, the form is km (77.b).

Arguments are typically shared, but that may notnecessarily be the case. In functional terms, what I will be discussing here are thedomains of (a) complementation, understood, in the sense of Noonan (1985), as acomplex structure involving a clause that serves as argument of a matrix verb; (b)relativization, a clause that serves as modifier of a head noun, thus belonging within anoun phrase; (c) adverbial clauses, those expressing contextual or circumstantialinformation that serves as a frame for the main event described by the matrix verb, that is,clauses that modify a verb phrase or clause; (d) constructions expressing aspectualmeanings, such as the inchoative, the progressive, and the continuous; and (e) thecomparative of superiority. Causative constructions, discussed in section IV.5.2, alsoconstitute one type of complex construction in Apinajé, since they are expressed by thetypes of syntactic strategies described here.","[286, 287]"

Emphatic forms of personal pronouns. Non-hortative personal pronouns displayemphatic forms. Emphatic first and second person pronouns include an oral open vowel

and the suffix -m in root-final position; the stem initial plosive is always voiceless, sincethe pronoun carries discourse stress. The emphatic third person pronoun is also realizedwith an open vowel. The inventory of emphatic personal pronouns as compared to theirnonemphatic counterparts is listed in table III.2. The example in (108) is illustrative.","[175, 176, 177]"
"        Serialization requires the nonfinite form of verbs when the (causative orinstrumental morpheme) verb  ‘do’ is involved. Otherwise, it is just the bare form ofverbs that occur in a sequence; in this case, the verbs involved are usually from the classof intransitives (i.e. they take no inflection in their finite form). In Apinajé, serializationalways involves either a movement verb or a position verb. Not all verbs belonging toeach category are eligible for serial constructions expressing aspectual meanings, butonly a selected few. When verbs from outside this inventory are used, the resultingoverall meaning of the construction is more literal than grammatical, sometimes yieldingawkward or jocose meanings.
                                                                                            276
       General criteria used for deciding whether these clauses or predicators in asequence all belong in a single complex syntactic unit are of three kinds: prosodic,morphological, and syntactic. From the prosodic point of view, the elements of eachcomplex construction belong within a single sentential intonation contour.","[289, 290]"

Verbs. The nominative argument of a simple verbal clause controls reflexivization andreciprocity. One target of reflexivization is the direct object of a transitive clause. In thiscase, the reflexive marker ami occupies the direct object position slot in the verb phrase,in which case the verb may take a relational prefix if vowel initial. Compare theexamples (a-b) below.

           The reciprocal marker has the same distribution in the verb phrase as the reflexivemarker; likewise, it may target the accusative argument of a transitive clause. However,at least at the semantic level, the reciprocal marks both the subject relation, whichcontrols the process, and the object relation, which is the target, since the reciprocalrelation must include at least two referents.

"        Piagri ‘give birth’ is coherent with the semantic analysis pia+gri ‘body/womb+besmall’ (which is definitely the case as one gives birth!); this analysis is supported by themorphological pattern for person inflection as well as the classification of the verb as adescriptive. Piao is also coherent in both semantic and morphosyntactic terms: pia+o‘body+suck’, from the perspective of the child, should not require person marking on thestem, since the body belongs to the mother. Accordingly, piao is an intransitive verb(section 3.1.2.1).(58)    piao                   ‘nurse (on mother’s breast)’         < o ‘drink; suck’

Kr- Verb Stems. Kr-verbs also include a nominal component. The morpheme kr,which may mean ‘head’, also encodes the more general notions of ‘spherical object;nugget; chunk’. The verb stems in which it occurs, below, are verbs of cutting whichimply that a chunk falls off in the process. Kr-verbs form a semantic class and displayno idiosyncratic behavior.(59)   kr r                ‘cut; trim [of hair]’
       kr ta                ‘cut off; chop off’                    < ta ‘cut’

       Verb stems belonging to this class seem more like instances of nounincorporation, since kr is a full-fledged noun of Apinajé. And if this hypothesis iscorrect, it would suit õ- verbs and pia- verbs equally well; however, there are nooccurrences of õ and pia as regular noun roots in the database.","[141, 142]"

Compounds consit of morethan one root (2.a), and may include derivational morphology as well (2.b). Derivationalmorphemes may be clitics or affixes attaching to the root (3).

 Relational Prefixes (RP) are part of the inflectional system of Apinajé. These morphemes occur
pervasively in vowel-initial nouns, verbs and postpositions of Apinajé. See details in section 4.1.2. below.

1.2. AffixesInflectional and derivational affixes are often monosyllabic morphemes whose structureis restricted to the V(C) and CV(C) syllable patterns. Certain inflectional affixes mayconsist of a single consonant, as is the case with relational prefixes and nonfinitenesssuffixes (sections 4.1.2. and 4.1.3.). Affixes do not display any particular stressproperties in Apinajé; they simply contribute segmental material to the phonologicalword, submitting to the overall stress rule applicable to that word. The verb pi ‘kill’ isinflected for person in (5). The finite form of the verb is shown in (a), and its nonfiniteform in (b).
(5) a. ic-pi                  [ic pi]            ‘kill me’
       a-pi                   [a pi]             ‘kill you’
       ku-pi                  [gu pi]            ‘kill it’      b. ic-pi-r              [ic pi ]           ‘kill me’
                                                                                                            85
         a-pi-r                     [a pi ]          ‘kill you’
         Ø-pi-r                     [ pi ]           ‘kill it’
         Formatives display the same structural properties as affixes, certainly becausethey too were affixes at an earlier stage in the development of the language. For instance,it is possible to identify personal prefixes that have been reanalyzed as part of somestems, which take productive inflectional morphology at the synchronic level (6).
(6) a. kupe                          [gu pe]           ‘touch’                     < ku- ‘3’

       pr n-ipok ri                 [ p ni pog ri] ‘in the core of the forest’1.3. CliticsClitics may be of three kinds: positional clitics, phrasal clitics and word clitics, all ofwhich display specific stress properties and, like the roots, may come in any of thesyllable patterns available. Positional clitics occupy specific slots in the structure of theclause, and they usually encode grammatical categories that pertain to the proposition asa whole, such as mood, tense, aspect and the like (7). Few phrasal clitics indicate theinitial boundary of a phrase; the tendency is for them to occur phrase finally (8). Thesame is true of word clitics, except that their structural domain is restricted to the(grammatical) word (9).2

        Some phrase final clitics retain stress prominence in their domain (10). Somepositional clitics retain stress prominence in a clitic sequence – that is true of the tenseand aspect clitics vis-à-vis mood and pronominal clitics. Notice that the clause-initial
written as monosyllabic function words and separated by spaces, since they have broader syntactic scope

2.     WordIn any language, words can be characterized in terms of phonological and grammaticalproperties, which constitute independent criterial dimensions. One general definition ofthe phonological word is provided in Dixon and Aikhenvald (2002) as follows:
          A phonological word is a phonological unit larger than the syllable (in some
          languages it may minimally be just one syllable) which has at least one (and
          generally more than one) phonological defining property chosen from the
          following areas:and occupy predictable positions in clauses and phrases.
                                                                                                88
               (a) Segmental features – internal syllabic and segmental structure;
                  phonetic realisations in terms of this; word boundary phenomena; pause
                  phenomena.
               (b) Prosodic features – stress (or accent) and/or tone assignment; prosodic
                  features such as nasalization, retroflexion, vowel harmony.
               (c) Phonological rules – some rules apply only within a phonological
                  word; others (external sandhi rules) apply specifically across a word
                  boundary.
         Note that there is likely to be a close interaction between these types of features
         (Dixon and Aikhenvald 2002: 13).","[96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102]"

  The distinction between the indefinite determiner õ and the homonymous genitive postposition õ is
noticeable, among other things, by the distribution of each: the determiner follows the head; the
postposition is the head of a lower phrase but it precedes the head of the higher structure.
3
  In this context, the indefinite article õ is pronounced as [õt]. It is not yet clear whether the reduced
consonant at coda position is morphological material, the result of a phonological process, or merely a
phonetic effect. Compared to that, there are instances in which the definite article ja in pronominal
function is also pronounced as the more “extended” form [ari]; under these circumstances, however, it
usually has the more adverbial meaning ‘here’. Thus, the alternation in shape is justifiable as the result of a
morphological process.

Quantifiers. The quantifiers wa ‘dual’ and me ‘plural’ are positional clitics too. Eitherone of them may co-occur with an overt head noun; unlike determiners, however, theseclitics precede the head noun they modify (11-12).(12) wa        di                                ‘(dual) women’

       The dual and plural clitics are most frequently used with pronominal elements.","[218, 219]"
"        The fact that Postposition is viewed here as a lexical category might seem at oddswith the fact that postpositions are function words. However, even though a clear set ofstandard postpositions (monosyllabic, high frequency of use, with more grammatical thanlexical meaning) does exist in the language, other members of this category seem morelike postpositions-in-the-making, evolving from a class of nouns that I will term here“relator nouns.” For that reason, it is almost innaccurate to speak of postpositions inApinajé as constituting a closed class; perhaps this might be best described as a “halfwayopen” class.",[153]
"Genitive constructions. The structure of a genitive construction is determined by thesubclass – alienable or inalienable – of the head noun (section III.3.1.1.1). Thus, a nounphrase headed by an inalienable noun is characterized structurally by juxtaposition (1.a-b)or, if person prefixes are involved, by prefixation on the head noun (1.c-d); in either case,a relational prefix occurs between a vowel-initial head and its dependent noun or personprefix.

The postpositional phrase encodes the genitive element and is dependent onthe alienable noun that heads the higher structure; note that the alienable noun does nottake any kind of prefix – relational or personal – despite the constituency relation it holdswith the genitive postpositional phrase (2.c), as indicated by intonational, distributionaland semantic factors.

        Besides the relational prefix strategy, phrase internal cohesion is indicated by thecontiguity between the elements involved, which may not be interrupted by extraneousmorphological material; the intonation pattern, with all elements encompassed under asingle intonation contour; and phrasal stress, which falls on the last element of the phrase,that is, the head (3).","[213, 214]"

3.   Word classesThe present section is about the content and function words of Apinajé: how theycategorize and how this categorization is expressed in structural terms, among otherthings. The discussion is organized in terms of lexical categories and grammaticalcategories. Lexical categories include nouns, verbs, postpositions and adverbials –mostly open classes (section 3.1). Grammatical categories are pronouns and clitics thatencode various grammatical meanings – words that consitute closed classes (section 3.2).","[117, 118, 119, 120]"
"        In descriptive verbs, the formative ka- is less transparent semantically (49), eventhough it is easier to find independent roots related to these descriptives than to ka-transitives (50).(49)      ka i                    ‘become thin [of hair]; fall [of long fibers]’

          pr        ‘remain; stay behind’      kapr            ‘be empty’
        One observation about the set in (49) is that it includes a number of “hair-related”terms. It also seems, on the basis of the semantic content of the roots listed above, thatka- operates as an overt index of state or change-of-state in these cases. This hypothesis
                                                                                            120
seems to apply beyond kagr ‘be(come) hot’, ka i ‘be(come) thin’, and kapri ‘be(come)sad’ (which could possibly be explained in metaphorical terms: ka- ‘become’+ pri‘short’), since some of these verbs already indicate state, as is the case with karr ‘beblond’. In the case of kapr, it seems it could relate to pr in the following way: prfocuses on the thing that has been left behind after everything else was gone, whereaskapr focuses on the space left after everything else has gone (for vowel alternations inApinajé see section 2.3.2). This is just a speculation, however; more systematic evidencemust be sought in historical-comparative analyses.","[133, 134]"
"        Subordination in Apinajé requires that the relevant verb be inflected fornonfiniteness. The ergative case marker may or may not mark the A argument,depending on coreference conditions. In complementation, the distribution of asubordinate predicate is the same as that of the equivalent nominal. The matrix verboccurs in final position, postposed to the subordinated element.",[289]
"       The Apinajé grammatical word can be identified according to some of the criterialisted in Dixon and Aikhenvald (2002:19-25). First, the grammatical word is internallycohesive, both formally, since its components constitute a bound unit; and semantically,because that unit conveys a conventionalized meaning. Secondly, the component

morphemes of a grammatical word in Apinajé follow a particular order, with word cliticsalways occupying the outermost final position in the word, thus indicating the word finalboundary, and person prefixes appearing in first position, when applicable, thusindicating the word-initial boundary. Thirdly, speakers generally utter the word withoutinterruptions or pauses, except in case of hesitations, clarifications or factors of this sort,which are part of natural speech in any language. Finally, the Apinajé grammatical wordcan constitute a complete utterance by itself.","[105, 106]"

4.1.2. Relational Prefixes       Relational prefixes constitute another morphological category common to Nouns,Verbs, and Postpositions. These morphemes are overt indices of the constituencybetween a head and a dependent element. In formal terms, relational prefixes serve aslinkers between a given root and some element that immediately attaches to it, includingcertain derivational morphemes (139.a), personal prefixes (139.b) or, at a more syntacticlevel, dependent noun phrases ((139.c); see section IV.1). The role of relational prefixes
                                                                                         183
is precisely to indicate this bond between units that belong together, either as constituentswithin a phrase, or as the component morphemes of a word, even compounds (139.d-e).(139) a. aw-j-apro                            ‘go shopping <INTR>’

       Historically, the occurrence of relational prefixes must have been phonologicallymotivated, with the proto-form having been a coronal – presumably palatal – segment(Davis 1966; Ribeiro 2004), whose reflexes in present-day Apinajé includes some sixdifferent forms. In addition to those, there are elements beginning in a bilabial stop thatdisplay distribution and function similar to those of relational prefixes; however, inaddition to form, other idiosyncrasies indicate that these morphemes must have evolvedhistorically from a distinct source.
                                                                                             184
Verbs. Relational prefixes occur in the finite forms of transitive and descriptive verbs,but only in the nonfinite forms of intransitive verbs, which do not take person marking inany other environment.","[196, 197, 198]"
"Person pronouns indicate the nominative argument of a sentence, whereas prefixesexpress the absolutive (section 4.1.1).
                                                                                          159
          Person pronouns encode the first, second and third persons. The first personincludes the hortative and plural inclusive distinctions (other number disctincitons are notexpressed in the pronominal system as such; instead, they are encoded by number clitics;see section 3.2.2.5 below). There are two sets of person pronouns, one for the realis modeand the other for the irrealis. The same form of the pronoun is used for first personpronoun and first person plural inclusive, but with different syntactic distribution (TableIII.1).","[172, 173]"
"        Like the ku- formative discussed above, it is possible that the i- observed in theseverbs may have started out as a third person prefix which became reanalyzed as part ofthe stem. Additionally, as with the õ- formative described above, this morphologicalpattern is also observable in a large number of nominal stems.(56)    ibc      ‘exterminate; kill [PL] O’ [TR]

Õ- Verb Stems. Õ-verbs constitute a fairly transparent semantic class. The morpheme õ-refers to the inner side of the body, as may be seen in most examples of the set (57). Themeaning of this classificatory morpheme becomes most obvious when it occurs withnouns, which form a much larger õ- class than verbs. These verbs, as well as the nouns,take the relational prefix -. Of the verbs below, the first three are descriptive; the fourthis a transitive, and the last is an intransitive.(57)    õcwa                   ‘be sleepy’

Pia- Verb Stems. Pia- verbs also have to do with the body, and make more sense if pia-is thought of as a nominal component. Of the base roots occurring with these verbs, atleast two are clearly identifiable: o ‘suck’ and gri ‘be small’. It is possible that m is anonfinite form of such a movement verb as ‘enter’ (in which case the meaning

‘embarrassed’ would call for a metaphorical interpretation), except that in that case, onewould expect the relational prefix c-, which does not occur.","[139, 140, 141]"

 The phenomenon described here as conversion is sometimes referred to in the literature as functional shift
or as zero derivation. As Bauer (1988) points out, however, the term “zero derivation” is not felicitous
because it would imply a contrast between a pair of word forms based on the presence versus the absence
of some distinctive morphological element between its members, which is not true in cases like these.
Thus, the “zero morph” analysis would be more suitable when describing a paradigmatic contrast.

2.3.5. SuppletionSome postpositions display suppletive inflectional forms. The postposition pe‘detrimental’, inflected for person in (28), is illustrative. A hypothesis for thesesuppletive forms is that, at an earlier historical stage, these postpositions must have takenthe third person prefix ku-. Vowel harmony may have applied, affecting the quality ofthe prefix vowel, followed by deletion of the word final vowel. This hypothesis needshistorical-comparative verification, however.

       A subset of verbs display different forms depending on the number of participantsin the events they describe. I do not analyze these cases as suppletion; these are actuallypairs of semantically related but distinct verb stems (section 3.1.2.3).","[112, 113]"
