  18 The variant n@ ‘one’ as in n@ . . . n@ ‘one . . . another’ of the number ‘one’ (whose form is nak) could be a shortened
form of the indeﬁnite pronoun n@k@ ‘another, other’ which is semantically very similar (see §10.3).
58     2 PhonologyB. Phonological Processes on Clitic Boundaries Within a Phonological Word
B1. Reduction of sequences of identical consonants. A sequence of identical consonants
on the boundary between a clitic and its host is reduced to a single consonant, e.g. kl@m
‘here (feminine singular)’ = ma:n ‘negative’ → kl@má:n ‘here not’ (§2.5.3, II). A complex verb
consisting of an adverb and a verb undergoes similar simpliﬁcation: what is bás s@tuá ‘I ask’
in very slow speech register becomes bas@tuá in normal speech register. Cf. A6, for a similar
process on suﬃx boundary.
B2. Vowel elision on clitic boundary. A sequence of -@ = -a becomes -a, e.g. l@ ata → lata
‘she then’, s@ ab@r → sab@r ‘these are two names’ etc. A similar rule applies on a suﬃx
boundary (see A4). However, the diﬀerence between A4 and B2 is that B2 is optional: a proclitic
like l@ can be pronounced as a separate word, and then vowel elision will not take place (as
shown in 2.1b, 2.1c). There is no such option for a suﬃx boundary where vowel elision is
always obligatory.
   The vowel elision does not apply with the cliticizable a ‘third singular feminine’ which occurs
on non-verbal predicate heads, e.g. s´@=á (name=3fem.sg.nom) ‘it is a name’ (not ∗ sa).
B3. Vowel fusion and simplification on clitic boundary. A sequence of two identical
vowels across a clitic boundary undergoes fusion and subsequent simpliﬁcation, e.g. a = a →
a, as in kus@dá=aká → [kus@dákà] ‘he ﬁnished thus’. This process is very frequent in
rapid speech, e.g. d@-k@-d@=a-d@ ra:w (he-obl-masc.sg=dem.dist-masc.sg maternal.nephew)
‘that maternal nephew of his’ is pronounced as [d@-k@-da-d@ ra:w]. A sequence ata=adakw
(then=stay) ‘stay then’ becomes [atadakw].
B4. Further fast speech phenomena. A posture verb preceded by another verb in a sequenc-
ing form -n ‘doing at the same time as’ (§18.2) can be pronounced together as one phonological
word, and then the ﬁnal -n of the ﬁrst verb is elided: wuk´@-n r@-na-wún (listen-seq sit-act.foc-
1sgbas.vt) ‘I am sitting listening; I am listening’ is pronounced, in fast speech, as [wuk´@r@na-
wun]; and wapá-n napa-kú (leave-seq compl.vb-compl.ss) ‘having left for good, having fully
completed leaving’ becomes [wapànapakú]. A sequence of two verbs one of which is monosyl-
labic may also result, as in dá:-n adá (sit-seq stay.impv) ‘sit down’ pronounced as [dá:n-dà]. (A
year-old baby repeatedly reproduced this command as dandá, which for her was a way to refer
to a chair: see §13.2.2.)
C1. Epenthetic glide y is inserted on any boundary, breaking a sequence of i and a, as in saki-
ab ‘name debate-too’ > [saki-y-ab]; tami=ad (area=3masc.sg.nom) ‘it is an area’ > [tami-y-ad],
and aki=ata ‘news then’ > [aki-y-ata].
                               2.7 i n t o nat i o n patt e r n sFalling intonation is characteristic of the end of a declarative clause. Interrogative intonation
contour involves rising intonation on the last word of a clause (marked with Ű) with high pitch
on the clause as a whole and an additional rising pitch on the last syllable, as in:
2.3 ak@         s@k@r waku-k@-na-d@m@nŰ?
    what.fem.sg time go.out-fut-act.foc-2masc.sgbas.vt
    ‘What time will you go out?’
  In a rhetorical question, the sharp rise can be preceded by a falling intonation on the ﬁrst
word (marked with Ů):
                                                                  2.7 Intonation patterns       592.4 ñ@nŮ        agulaŰ?
    you.fem.sg why
    ‘What are you here for?
  Commands have a slightly rising intonation, as in 2.5–6:
2.5 p@s@pa:m            atakŰ
    rubbish+lk+loc impv+put
    ‘Put (this) into the rubbish!’
2.6 da-n        adaŰ
    go.down-seq sit.impv
    ‘Sit down!’
   A combination of falling and rising intonation is characteristic of ﬁrst person imperative
clauses, often used as a marker of turn taking in discourse:
2.7 waŮuŰ
    speak+1sgimpv
    ‘May I talk?’
   Vocative intonation involves slight rise on the last syllable of the vocative and simultaneous
lengthening of vowel in the last syllable of the vocative forms (restricted to kinship terms and
personal names).
2.8 Maliye:::Ű
    ‘Mali!’
   Farewelling intonation is similar, with the proviso that it involves slight rise and then slight
fall on the last syllable (note that its vowel is often lengthened):
2.9 yaradákw@::: ŰŮ
    well+stay.impv
    ‘Stay well’ (said by someone who is leaving as a farewell formula)
   Exclamatory clauses involve a sharply falling intonation contour, especially if they include
interjections expressing surprise, e.g. waŮ ‘Wow, oh dear’.
   A further pattern in complex sentences which involve sequences of clauses involves rising
intonation on the completive medial verb (see Chapter 18). The ﬁnal verb of the ﬁrst clause is
repeated in the subsequent medial clause. A diﬀerent-subject medial clause is shown in 2.10.
Clause-ﬁnal falling intonation in 2.10 is shown with Ů.
2.10 adiya                 y@-na-diŮ        [short pause] y@-da-kŰ        ata
     dem.dist.react.top.pl go-foc-3plbas.vt               go-3pl-compl.ds then
     wa-dŮ
     say-3masc.sgbas.p
     ‘They went. Them having gone, he said’
  A short pause only appears if some time is supposed to have elapsed between the time of the
ﬁrst sentence, and of the second one. A medial verb may form one phonological phrase with
the ﬁnal verb in the preceding main clause if no time is understood to have elapsed between
the two sentences. In 2.11, this is signalled with square brackets around the sequence of two
verbs:y@-dì y@-kú. The last (stressed) syllable of y@-kú is pronouncd with more intensity than
the last (stressed) syllable of y@-dì.
60     2 Phonology2.11 adiya                 [y@-dì      y@-kú]Ű      ata wa-diŮ
     dem.dist.react.top.pl go-3plbas.p go-compl.ss then say-3plbas.pŰ
     ‘They went. They went, having gone, they said’
   This same intonation pattern also appears in Tok Pisin when spoken by the Manambu.
This pattern has been observed with medial verbs marked with some sequencing morphemes
(e.g. cotemporaneous sequencing -ta:y), but not others (the immediate sequencing -taka, the
temporal overlap -(k@)k@b, and the sequencing -@n). Juxtaposed dependent clauses have a
distinctive intonation contour with the pitch going high up on the last syllable of the predicate
(see §19.1).
        3        Grammatical Relations
Understanding grammatical relations in Manambu is pivotal for understanding its grammar.
A member of any major word class can head an intransitive predicate, or be a modiﬁer in an
NP. A verb as head of either transitive or intransitive predicate takes tense- and topicality-
sensitive verbal cross-referencing suﬃxes, to mark subject (A/S) and non-subject. In contrast,
if a member of most other classes is head in an intransitive predicate, it takes person-marking
enclitics (§3.1). Grammatical relations are also marked by cases on nouns, on subject-non-
subject basis (§3.2), and through a set of demonstratives, on an absolutive basis (§3.3).
                                3.1 c ro s s -referencingNouns, adjectives, adverbs, verbs, and most closed subclasses (see Chapter 10) can head an
intransitive predicate. Only a verb can be head of a transitive predicate. In the indicative mood,
all Manambu verbs can cross-reference one or two arguments. One of these has to be the
subject—A or S. A non-subject argument can also be cross-referenced if it is more topical than
the subject, independently of the verb’s transitivity.
   This is how it works. In 3.1, the S=A ambitransitive verb ‘know’ is used intransitively. The
suﬃx -na- ‘action focus’ indicates that the focus is on the fact of knowing, and not on what
is known. The subject (S), ‘I’, is cross-referenced on the verb. The cross-referencing suﬃxes
employed are in Table 3.1.
3.1 b@      laku-na-wun
    already know/understand-act.foc-1fem.sgbas.vt
    ‘I know (already), I am knowledgeable’
  This same verb can be used transitively, with an object. The object in 3.2 is not topical—
that is, it is not something to be further deployed in the discourse. The subject (A) is the only
participant cross-referenced on the verb:
3.2 (wun) a                  yar@k b@    laku-na-wun
    I       dem.dist+fem.sg news already know/understand-act.foc-1fem.sgbas.vt
    ‘I already know that news’
   If a constituent other than the subject is more topical than the subject, both are cross-
referenced on the verb. In 3.3–4 the object is topical, and it is cross-referenced in the second
position on the verb, with the same markers as the ones used for the S/A in 3.1–2 (Table 3.1).
The subject is also cross-referenced, but with a diﬀerent set of markers (Table 3.2). Person
marking on the verb can occur together with a full NP. Since the NP is optional, it is in
parentheses.
3.3 (d@ wun-a:m) laku-da-wun
    he i-lk+obj know-3masc.sgsubj.vt-1fem.sgbas.vt
    ‘He knows me’
62     3 Grammatical Relations3.4 (a-d@             ma:j wun) laku-tua-d
    dem.dist-masc.sg story I         know-1sgsubj.vt-3masc.sgbas.vt
    ‘I have understood it (e.g. a long story)’
  An oblique can be cross-referenced on the verb, if topical. The destination, ‘road’, is the
topic of 3.5, and is cross-referenced in the second position on the intransitive verb ‘go’. The
road is in the allative case (§7.5).
3.5 (wun) a-d@                yaba:r           yi-tua-d
    I      dem.dist-masc.sg road+lk+all go-1sgsubj.vt-3masc.sgbas.vt
    ‘I went towards that road’ (that we are talking about)
   The choice of an argument or an oblique to be cross-referenced on a verb depends on the
topicality of this argument (or oblique), and also on the verb’s semantics. Out of context,
3.6 could be understood as ‘I ﬁnished that work (we were talking about)’ (then, the object
‘work’ would be cross-referenced), or as ‘I ﬁnished that work at that (topical) time’ (then,
‘time’ would be cross-referenced), or as ‘I ﬁnished that work in that (topical) way’ (then
‘way, manner’, of feminine gender (§5.2.1), would be cross-referenced). The cross-referenced
constituent can be overtly expressed, but does not have to, inasmuch as it is retrievable from the
context:
3.6 a                 yawi kus@-tu@-l
    dem.dist+fem.sg work ﬁnish-1sgsubj.p-3fem.sgbas.p
    ‘I ﬁnished that work (we were talking about)’
    ‘I ﬁnished that work at that (topical) time’
    ‘I ﬁnished that work in that (topical) way’
  Example 3.7 also has two meanings—diﬀerentiated only by the context.
3.7 ñap-a-ta:kw                Dora kui-la-b@r
    mother’s.sister-lk-woman Dora give.to.third.p-3fem.sgsubj.vt-3dubas.vt
    ‘Aunt Dora gave (us) these two (Malay apples)’
    ‘Aunt Dora gave (Malay apples) to the two (girls)’
  Topical constituents which can be cross-referenced in the second position include time,
location, destination, and manner. The following can never be cross-referenced:
  (a) A copula complement—see 3.8 and 3.9. The copula subject is always cross-referenced;
      the second position can be occupied by location, manner or time.
3.8 a-b@r        ñ@di        kwakuli t@-b@r
    dem.dist-du children:du orphan become/be/stand-3dubas.vt
    ‘Those children became orphans’
3.9 a-b@r       ñ@di         kwakuli t@-br@-di
    dem.dist-du children:du orphan become/be/stand-3dusubj.p-3plbas.p
    ‘They became orphans at those times, or in those ways, or in those places’
  (b) The second argument of verbs of ‘becoming’ or ‘turning into’:
3.10 l@ aka b@          m@d        patiaku-l
     she here already cassowary turn-3fem.sgbas.p
     ‘She has then already turned into a cassowary’
                                                                     3.1 Cross-referencing       63  (c) Nominal components of complex verbs (§7.2), e.g. gu ‘water’ in gu yaku- ‘wash in water,
      bathe’; m@l ‘eye’ in m@l v@- (eye see) ‘see with eyes’; or wapruku- ‘be overfull’, as 3.11.
      Here, ‘house’ (of masculine gender) is the subject:
3.11 br@-k@-d@        wi     miyawa sa:n-a-d@ka    wapruku-d
     3du-obl-masc.sg house all       money-lk-only overﬁll-3masc.sgbas.p
     ‘Their whole house was overﬂowing with money’
  (d) A constituent marked with a transportative, substitutive, or comitative case—see
      §§7.7–9.
  (e) A speech report—see §19.5.
   Ellipsis of noun phrases, frequent in speech, makes the exact reference of cross-referenced
participants highly context dependent. Statistically, some participants tend to be cross-
referenced more often than others. For instance, the addressee of the verb wa- ‘say’ is more
often cross-referenced than the message. This has to do with the fact that wa- is frequently
used to frame direct speech reports which can never be cross-referenced. A form wa-k@-tua-di
(say-fut-1sgsubj.vt-3plbas.vt) can mean ‘I will tell (something) to them’, or ‘I will tell them,
e.g. stories’, depending on the context.
   A form kur-m@na-d@wun (do/make-2sgsubj.vt-1masc.sgbas.vt) is more likely to mean ‘you
did (something) to me’, than ‘you created or made me’, if the story from which this example
comes is not a creation myth. With the verb ‘give’, the overall frequency of cross-referencing
either the ‘recipient’ or the ‘gift’ is the same (this goes against the frequently discussed pref-
erence, among the languages of the world, to mark the recipient rather than the ‘gift’ of
‘give’).
   In contrast to verbs, non-verbal predicates cross-reference just the subject, with cross-
referencing enclitics listed in Table 3.4.
   Table 3.1 features the ‘basic’ set of cross-referencing markers used for
   (i) the subject, if no other, more topical, constituent is to be cross-referenced—as in 3.1–2;
  (ii) the more topical constituent other than the subject—as in 3.3–5.
   In situation (ii), the subject is cross-referenced with a special set of cross-referencing suﬃxes
as listed in Table 3.2. A marker from this set is always followed by a marker from the ‘basic’ set.
The relevant verbal cross-referencing sets distinguish what we call ‘versatile tense’ (employed
for present, recent past, and in future contexts—see §12.2). The tense distinction is neutralized
in dual and plural of the basic set. The non-tense-sensitive suﬃxes in the subject set are the
ones used in partially inﬂected verbal forms (where only the subject is expressed: see §11.1.1).
   The two sets of personal markers are similar, but not identical. The versatile tense basic set
diﬀers from its past counterpart only in the feminine singular forms. The versatile tense subject
markers diﬀer from their past tense counterpart in the quality of the ﬁnal vowel in all the forms
except for ﬁrst and third person plural where the present–recent past set has an extra syllable
-na.
   The basic sets diﬀer from the subject sets in ﬁrst person (all numbers). The subject set has no
gender distinctions in ﬁrst person. The basic sets are easily segmentable: they contain gender-
number markers -d- ‘masculine’, -l/ø- ‘feminine’ in the singular, and number markers -b@r -
‘dual’ and -di- ‘plural’, in dual and plural forms respectively.
   All other forms are similar to personal pronouns featured in Table 3.3. The basic set shows
more similarities with the personal pronouns than the subject set. The ﬁrst person markers in
the subject sets are not related to the personal pronouns at all.
64     3 Grammatical Relations         Table 3.1 Verbs as heads of predicate: basic set of cross-referencing suﬃxes           Person/gender                 Sg                  Du                 Pl                              Versatile          Past   Versatile/Past   Versatile/Past           1 fem                -wun          -l-wun       -b@r-an            -di-an           1 masc                      -d@-wun           2 fem                -ñ@n          -l@-ñ@n      -b@r -b@r     -di-gw@r , -di-gur           2 masc                   -d@-m@n           3 fem                  -ø              -l         -b@r               -di           3 masc                        -d  Person-marking enclitics whose only role is to cross-reference the subject of a verbless clause
with a non-verb as a predicate head are given in Table 3.4. The segmental make-up of the
markers is almost identical with the basic cross-referencing set in Table 3.1.
  The diﬀerence lies (a) in that the markers in Table 3.4 are enclitics and the ones in Table 3.1
are suﬃxes (see §§2.5–6 on the diﬀerences between these), and (b) in the existence of free
variants of ﬁrst and third person singular feminine forms. The vowel a in the forms in Table
3.4 can be considered a kind of linker; note its absence with the suﬃxes.
  Example 3.12 illustrates an adjective, and 3.13 an adverb as head of intransitive predicates.
3.12 a-di         ja:p kuprap=adi
     dem.dist-pl thing bad=3plnom
     ‘These things are bad’
3.13 yabi:b-yabi:b=ad
     quickly-quickly=3masc.sgnom
     ‘It (the way he is moving) is very quickly’
In 2.1–2 nouns were used as predicate heads. These same enclitics mark focused constituents,
in highlighting focus constructions (see §20.3).
   The choice between cross-referencing just the subject or also an additional participant on a
Manambu verb is largely independent of the verb’s transitivity: both transitive and intransitive
verbs can cross-reference one or two arguments.
   Importantly, the number of arguments cross-referenced correlates with the grammatical
categories of the verb. The option of either one or two cross-referencing positions is available
for independent positive indicative declarative and interrogative clauses, positive and nega-
tive habitual declarative and interrogative clauses, relative clauses, and dependent juxtaposed
clauses (both negative and positive). See examples 3.1–10 above. Such forms are fully inﬂected
for person (see §11.1.1; Table 11.1). Only one cross-referencing position is available for all these
clauses if the verb contains the action focus marker -na-. Causal clauses and all diﬀerent-subject
medial clauses also cross-reference just the subject (with the non-tensed suﬃxes in Table 3.2).
The imperative has its own paradigm of subject cross-referencing (see §13.2). All these forms
are partially inﬂected.

   No cross-referencing is found in negative declarative non-habitual clauses, in positive com-
pletive and customary aspects and in a variety of non-declarative forms including prohibitive,
desiderative, and frustrative, and all same-subject medial clauses. These forms are uninﬂected.
See a summary in Table 11.1.
   The number of cross-referencing positions on the verb only marginally relates to mood,
modality, polarity, and aspect. Most of the verbal forms which accept one cross-referencing
position or take no cross-referencing are non-declarative. Most negative forms take no cross-
referencing at all.
   The number of cross-referencing positions is independent of the verb’s transitivity. It
depends on the pragmatic properties of the non-subject constituent, and not so much the
lexical properties of the verb itself. This is partly reminiscent of Ugric and Samoyedic
languages.
   There, a special verbal conjugation (called ‘objective’) is used for transitive verbs if the
object is deﬁnite or topical. A transitive verb with an indeﬁnite object appears in the ‘sub-
jective’ conjugation (see, for instance, Moravcsik 1983 on Hungarian and Nikolaeva 1999 on
Northern Khanty). Diﬀerent sets of cross-referencing suﬃxes in Menya, an Angan language
from Morobe Province, Papua New Guinea (Whitehead 1991), mark more topical, and less
topical, subjects. However, in neither case is there a complete analogy with the Manambu
system.
   The marking of A/S as the only cross-referenced constituent (‘basic’ marking set) is the same
as the marking of the second argument if it is more topical than the subject. This may seem
reminiscent of split ergativity whereby, under certain conditions, the S constituent (the only       Table 3.4 Person marking on non-verbs as heads of predicate                                 Sg                         Du                   Pl         1 fem    =awun, =al-wun as free variants

a transitive verb). 1 However, the Manambu pattern is only superﬁcially similar to this, since:
  (a) the basic cross-referencing set marks A/S and also O, a locative, a manner, or a time
      constituent, that is, it is hardly comparable with a ‘real’ ergative/absolutive system, with
      an opposition between S/O and A; and
  (b) the occurrence of the marking is conditioned by the topicality of the participant and
      only partly by its grammatical function (we can recall that some relations, such as copula
      complement, or comitative, are never cross-referenced).
The closest analogy to the Manambu system comes from Alamblak (Sepik Hill: Bruce 1984:
184–8, 216–30). Here, an argument additional to the subject can be cross-referenced on the
verb ‘if it can be thought of as a crucial participant in the situation’ (219). Just as in Manambu,
the second argument marker follows the marker of the subject. However, unlike Manambu,
the same set of markers cross-references both arguments, and there are no special sets for non-
verbal predicates. It is not clear whether there are any types of arguments which can never be
cross-referenced. Sare (or Kapriman), also from the Sepik Hill family, does not have this feature
(Sumbuk 1999). Is this similarity between Manambu and Alamblak a simple coincidence? Or,
given that some Manambu subclans claim their origins to be in the area of Chambri lake—
to the south of which Alamblak is spoken (see §1.5.3)—could this be an areal feature? The
question remains open. Also see §§22.2–3, where we return to the issue of areal diﬀusion.
We conclude that, though marking the pragmatic status of constituents through variation in
cross-referencing patterns on the verb is not unprecedented, no other system we know of is
fully comparable with the way Manambu verbs mark their participants.
             3.2 gramm atical relat ions marked on noun phrasesCases in Manambu mark grammatical relations on a basic nominative-accusative principle.
Only deﬁnite and completely aﬀected objects are marked with the -Vm case ‘accusative/
locative’ (see §7.3 for a hypothesis concerning the motivation for this case syncretism). Table
3.5 summarizes the principles of dependent marking on nouns, and how these correlate with
the marking on verbs as heads of predicates.
   Table 3.5 shows that grammatical functions covered by the second-position cross-referencing
suﬃxes only somewhat overlap with the ones covered by cases. The case syncretism does not
fully coincide with the syncretism of meanings available for the basic cross-referencing set
when it refers to a non-subject constituent. We can recall that this may refer to location (for
which three cases are available: a location can be unmarked, marked with a locative case or
the terminative case); to an object (one case available), or to an instrument or manner (one
case available). This illustrates one-to-many correspondences in the relationship between cross-
referencing on the verb and case marking on nouns. Case meanings below the thick line in
Table 3.5 do not have a cross-referencing correlate: these constituents are not cross-referenced.
   An object marked with the accusative/locative case is likely to be a topic, and is cross-
referenced more often than an unmarked O, in terms of textual frequency. However, this is not a
   1 Instances whereby a language has an ergative pattern of marking grammatical relations depending on the topical
continuity of S/O include Asheninca Campa (an Arawak language from Peru: Payne and Payne (2005) showed how
a split intransitive pattern marks the main story line, or foregrounded actions). In Yagua (Peba-Yagua) and Pajonal
Campa (Arawak), S is marked like O to highlight some new information (but not a new participant) (Dixon 1994:
211).

steadfast rule: if another constituent is more topical than the O, then it will be cross-referenced.
We saw in 3.7 above that, with the verb ‘give’, either the gift or the recipient can be cross-
referenced, depending on their topicality. Only the ‘gift’ can be marked with accusative/locative,
while the recipient is always marked with dative.
   In 3.14, the place which is the topic of the stretch of discourse is cross-referenced on the verb
(with the feminine gender form). The indeﬁnite direct object, unmarked for case, is not.

   Alternatively, a completely aﬀected O marked with the accusative/locative case may be less
topical than the subject, especially if the verb is marked with the action focus -na-. In 3.15,
the angry man is determined to exterminate the moon who, as he thinks, is responsible for his
wife’s menstruation. The moon is marked for case and is the topic of the story, but is not cross-
referenced: the action focus -na- shows that the focus is on the action and it is more important
than the O.

referencing of O.
   We conclude that cross-referencing on verbs and case marking on nouns follow diﬀerent
principles. Verbs distinguish between subject and (topical) non-subject, while nouns operate on
a principle reminiscent of nominative-accusative. In addition, nouns distinguish a rather large
number of forms for non-core participants. We return to the discussion of cases in Chapter 7.
                    3.3 ‘ r e ac t i vat e d t o pi c’ d e m o n s t rat i v e sThere are three series of demonstratives marking ‘reactivated topic’—k@- series ‘proximal to
the speaker’, wa- series ‘proximal to the hearer’, and a- series ‘distant from both’ (discussed in
detail in §10.2.3). These always agree in gender and number with the S/O argument. They are
employed to bring an already established topic ‘back to action’, if it has not been mentioned
for some time. Consider 3.16, said to 5-year-old Kerryanne who was running around at a
local market, to remind her of the existence of her mother and myself (whom she ought to
be following):
3.16 abra                       yi-na-b@r
     dem.dist.react.top+dual go-act.foc-3dubas.vt
     ‘Those two are going!’ (I am reminding you of them; or else you will be left behind)
  If an O constituent is a reactivated topic, it is obligatorily cross-referenced on the verb (using
the basic set in the second cross-referencing position). In 3.17, the bundle of sago established
as a topic in the previous stretch of discourse is mentioned again. Since it is topical, it is also
cross-referenced on the verb:
3.17 na:gw ada                            ka-war-la-d
     sago dem.dist.react.top+masc.sg carry-go.up-3fem.sgsubj.vt-3masc.sgbas.vt
     ‘She has carried up that previously mentioned sago’
   With the ditransitive verb ‘give’, a reactivated topic marker refers to the recipient rather
than the gift if it is more animate than the gift, unless the gift is more topical. Example 3.18
comes from a story about a man (the topic of the whole story) who was considered dead by
his relatives. In the previous stretch of text the ﬂying fox who had been looking after the man
tells him that his relatives were arranging a mortuary feast for him. The man has not been
mentioned for a paragraph or so. Then, it turns out that the preparations for the mortuary
feast for the man are under way at the man’s house. The man is thus ‘brought back’ into the
text as the reactivated topic. The mortuary feast, in the O function in 3.18, is the gift; the
‘reactivated topic demonstrative’, and the cross-referencing on the verb, refer to the man:
70     3 Grammatical Relations3.18 maja:n          ada                            kui-da-d

     ‘They were giving mortuary feast to him (the reactivated topic)’
   We will see, in §10.2.3, that a reactivated topic demonstrative can refer to the S of an
ambitransitive verb used intransitively. It can also refer to a location, as in 10.68. The content
of a direct speech report is never referred to with such a demonstrative. The problem of whether
the reactivated topic demonstrative forms one NP with a noun it refers to or not is discussed
in §10.2.3.
   The predominantly absolutive (S/O) basis for the reactivated topic markers agrees with a
cross-linguistic tendency for a correlation between the S/O function and topicality (Du Bois
1987). That a demonstrative should operate on an absolutive basis is hardly surprising—in
Dyirbal and a few other languages, an NP including a nominal demonstrative may only occur
in S or O function (Dixon 2003: 83, 94–99; Aikhenvald and Dixon forthcoming). Reactivated
topic demonstratives provide a strong criterion for S (see, for instance, the discussion of
polyfunctional verbs and their argument structure in §4.2.2). The subject of a verbless clause or
head of non-verbal predicate is hardly ever referred to with the reactivated topic demonstrative
(the implication of this is that it is not treated on a par with S arguments).
            3.4 gra m m at i c a l r e lat i o n s i n m a na m bu: a s ummaryCross-referencing on the verb and case marking on nouns in Manambu operate on diﬀerent
principles. The choice of cross-referencing depends on the tense-aspect-mood and polarity, and
on the presence of a participant more topical than the subject. Case marking is reminiscent
of a nominative-accusative system, with the occurrence of the object case depending on the
deﬁniteness and the degree of involvement of the O. Systems of this kind are cross-linguistically
attested (see Aikhenvald 1994 for a brief survey).
   Cross-referencing on the verb is more unusual. It follows a subject-non-subject principle. The
subject of a verb, be it A or S, always has to be cross-referenced. Any non-subject constituent—
with the exception of copula complement, transportative, comitative, and substitutive con-
stituents, and speech reports—can be cross-referenced. (This is reminiscent of Alamblak, from
the Sepik Hill family.) The same, ‘basic’, marking is used for cross-referencing the subject (A/S)
with no other topical constituent; and for cross-referencing a topical non-subject. In addition,
all of the A/S of all verbs are marked in the same way. The subject of a non-verbal predicate
head acquires a somewhat diﬀerent marking, and does not distinguish tense.
   In addition, three series of demonstratives marking ‘reactivated topic’ operate on an absolu-
tive basis, marking gender and number agreement with the topical S/O argument which is then
highly likely to be cross-referenced on the verb.
   The three ways of marking grammatical relations allow for a highly elaborate way of speci-
fying the topicality of participants and the involvement and deﬁniteness of the object.
   A historical note is in order. The dependent marking on nouns appears older than the
unusual system of verbal cross-referencing. Cases for core arguments are a shared feature
of Ndu languages, while the personal marking of two arguments on verbs appears to be a
Manambu innovation also shared with Gala. Iatmul has only subject cross-referencing which
appears to be a relatively recent innovation.
        4        Word Classes
Open word classes in Manambu are nouns (§4.1) and verbs (§4.2) Two subclasses of adjectives
are discussed in §4.3, and §4.4 focuses on the semi-closed class of adverbs. A brief overview of
closed classes is in §4.5.
                                           4.1 nounsAll nouns have grammatical categories of gender (Chapter 5), number (Chapter 6), and case
(Chapter 7). Syntactically, a noun can be both head and dependent in possessive constructions
(Chapter 8), head and modiﬁer in an NP, and head of predicate (see §4.3 and §4.4). Derivation
and compounding are discussed in Chapter 9. The types of noun phrases and their features
(including word order) are addressed in Chapter 20, within the context of other multiword
constituents.
   Nouns divide into a number of subclasses, in terms of their morphophonological properties
(§,4.1.1) and in terms of semantics and correlating grammatical properties of their referents
(§4.1.2).","[84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98]"

        PrefaceThis is a grammar of Manambu, a language of the Ndu family, which is, in terms of numbers of
speakers, the largest language family of the Sepik area of New Guinea. Manambu is spoken by
about 2,500 people in ﬁve villages—three of which, Avatip, Malu, and Yambon, are suﬃciently
big to appear on most maps of Papua New Guinea. I started studying the language in 1995,
as part of my work on classiﬁers, genders, and noun classes. I was interested in learning a
language with shape-based genders. Alan Rumsey was teaching a ﬁeld methods course at
the ANU, with Pauline Agnes Luma Laki as a consultant. I came along to the course, and
then carried on working with Pauline for more than ten years afterwards—this is how my
voyage of discovery started. I have since worked with several dozen speakers of Manambu,
mostly in Avatip. Pauline Agnes Luma Laki and myself are currently engaged in preparing a
comprehensive dictionary of the language.
   This grammar contains an analysis of the Manambu language, starting from a brief charac-
terization of the language and its speakers, then going on to phonology, morphology, syntax,
discourse organization, and semantics. The analysis is cast in terms of a cumulative typological
framework of linguistic analysis—which employs ‘the fundamental theoretical concepts that
underlie all work in language description and change’ (Dixon 1997: 128) and in terms of which
signiﬁcant typological generalizations are postulated; this has come to be called ‘basic linguistic
theory’. I have avoided employing any transient formalisms. This grammar is part of genuine
documentation of the Manambu language in its varied facets.
   Every chapter of the grammar includes a presentation of the facts of the language interwoven
with arguments for their analysis within a typological framework. No attempt has been made
to separate pure ‘description’ from theoretical interpretation—which would not be a productive
task. A typological perspective for each phenomenon is crucial for the analysis given here.
   Detailed exempliﬁcation is provided for every grammatical point. Most examples come
from texts, and a few from spontaneous—or carefully directed—conversation. An additional
objective was to convey as much of the Manambu culture as possible through using naturally
occurring examples. I avoid using elicited sentences; elicitation was limited to lexicon and to
paradigms.
   English glosses are kept as close as possible to the glosses and explanations oﬀered by
my consultants. Readers should be warned against trying to draw conclusions concerning
Manambu grammar and semantics from study of the translations.
   Examples, tables, diagrams, ﬁgures, charts, and footnotes are numbered separately within
each chapter. Footnotes are also numbered separately for each chapter. The orthography used
in the examples from languages other than Manambu, and language names, follows that of the
sources (unless indicated otherwise).
   This grammar can be used as a sourcebook for further typological studies, and as a model
for further grammars of languages of the Ndu and of other families of the New Guinea area.
It is far from being the last word on Manambu—the grammar is intended to provide a sound
systematic foundation for further studies, reanalyses, and reinterpretations.
   It is my hope that this book will encourage linguists to go out into the ﬁeld and document
languages threatened by extinction (before it is too late to do so). Nothing can compare with
the intellectual excitement of working out the grammatical system of a previously undescribed
language.
        AcknowledgementsI never planned to work on a Papuan language—until I decided I needed to know more about
shape-based genders for my work on classiﬁers, genders, and noun classes. I am grateful to
Alan Rumsey for introducing me to Pauline Agnes Luma Laki in 1995. Pauline adopted me as
her younger sister, and has since been my closest collaborator. My warmest thanks go to her.
   This grammar would not have been written without the self-sacriﬁcing help, and wonderful
linguistic insights, of Jacklyn Yuamali Benji Ala—whom Pauline lovingly called ‘angel without
wings’ ( p@ p t@-ma:r-na angel). She spent hours helping me with transcriptions, translations,
explanations, and at the same time cooking, cleaning, looking after her children, and telling the
most wonderful and sophisticated stories. Her help and dedication could never be suﬃciently
acknowledged.
   I owe an eternal debt of gratitude to my Manambu friends and family. I am grateful to
James S@su Laki, Joel Yuakalu Luma, David Yagenmas Takendu, Leo Luma Yambwi, John
Sepaywus, Jamis Katalu Angi Balangawi, K@mbwiyat, and Kulanawi Yuakaw, for sharing their
insights and histories with me. Paul Kat Badaybæg and John Sepaywus were my main teachers
of the Manambu history and lore. Catie Teketa:y, Jennie Kudapa:kw, Lowai, the late Wimali
Yabukwi, Gemaj, Yuawalup, Maguniway, Yipawal, Sawsepali, Tagwatakw, Gaiawalimæg,
Walinum, Ester Yuaya:b, and Ñatabi did not just tell stories and sing women’s songs to me—
they shared their warmth and friendship, and made me feel part of the village.
   Piurkaramb, Leo Kalangas, and Waliaundemi, of Malu, and Aulapan, Seplawan, and Yuk-
waygab, of Yawabak, shared with us stories of the Manambu past. In Malu I was privileged
to meet Duamakwa:y—the oldest man in the Manambu community. Jennie Kudapa:kw,
Yuawalup, and Catie Teketa:y spent hours helping me with transcriptions and translations.
Kawidu (or Rex) was a most patient and insightful teacher, who never tired of correcting my
mistakes. And he was also the greatest canoe guide I ever had—he took us everywhere and
patiently explained what was what. Ken Nayau shared with me his linguistic observations
about Manambu. The late Eric Yuamalen, and his wife Martha Pambwi, taught me things
no one else could. The intuitions of these natural linguists helped put the grammar into shape.
   I learnt a lot—both as a linguist, and as a person—from so many more people. Dameliway,
or simply Damel, has been the warmest friend I have had for years, as was her sister Motuway.
Gemaj—my classiﬁcatory mother—told us the most remarkable stories, and looked after me
as only a mother could. And Karkamb’s (Nelly’s) smile would always make the whole house
joyful. Nelma’s energy and wit brightened our days. Dora and Janet, my classiﬁcatory sisters,
were towers of strength in every way—always full of love and friendship, as was their mother,
Lowai. I greatly enjoyed the company of so many more—not least, Lucy Leo and Ludi (Leo
Yambwi’s wives) with whom I could only communicate in Tok Pisin. Luke Ala (Jager), Jacklyn
Yuamali’s husband, was a remarkable host, and a warm friend.
   Some of my best friends, and dedicated teachers, were children. During my two stays in
Avatip, I learnt more from Jacklyn Yuamali’s Tanina (8 in 2001–2, and 11 in 2004) than from
many adults. Her wit, energy, intelligence, and linguistic intuitions are unsurpassable. By the
time she was 11, she could tell stories almost as well as her grandmother Gemaj. Her little
sister Kerryanne, whom I ﬁrst knew as a 3- and then as a 5-year-old, was a great help—as a
non-stop talker, and also as an ‘assistant nurse’ (one of the duties I assigned her: helping me
perform ﬁrst-aid on other people). Celestin and Stevie (Karkamb’s children) were always at
                                                                    Acknowledgements        xviihand if I had a question to ask. Jennie Kudapa:kw’s son Ryan, Damel’s son Alonso, Gaia’s
daughter Sylvia, and, of course, ever-smiling Simona, the daughter of Teketa:y and Kawidu,
were a source of joy, and most patient and thorough teachers. Janet’s daughter Joana (Zoana)
and Jacklyn’s baby Jemima taught me a lot about how children acquire Manambu and Tok
Pisin. I will always miss my Manambu family.
   Pauline Laki, Albert Yuamuk, Damel, Patrick, Kawindu, Iraman, Leo Yambwi, Maguniwai,
and especially Piurkaramb were instrumental for our trip to Swakap (Swagup). Thanks to
Piurkaramb, we were immediately adopted into Martin Kumwau’s family. I am immensely
grateful for Martin’s and his wife’s hospitality, and for endless hours of patient work on the
Gala language he spent with me, together with Peter, Luke, and Bukakoinben.
   I greatly enjoyed talking to all the Manambu people I met outside the village, in Port
Moresby, Wewak, and Canberra—especially Ruth (Nebekaru), Joel Apikuñ Luma (Pauline
Laki’s elder brother), Mejikay, Jibudam, Ñidewi, Kila, Elizabeth, Paul, and so many more.
And, of course, always cheerful Wanita, Ruth’s and Joel Yuakalu Luma’s daughter! Pauline
Laki’s children, Cassie, Salome, and Kelvin, will always be special to me, just like children of
my own.
   Thanks are also due to Pius Bonjui, himself a Iatmul (from Korogo), the head of the Papua
New Guinea branch of ABC radio in Melbourne. Pius organized an interview for Pauline Laki
on the program Lingua Franca—as a result, many people could hear a Manambu mourning
song and her explanations of the Manambu name ownership. And thank you to Martin
Lawrence, the creator of Lingua Franca, for introducing me to Pius in the ﬁrst place.
   Having a respected anthropologist—Simon Harrison—disentangle the intricacies of the
Manambu culture was a great advantage for me, as a linguist. I am very grateful to him. I was
also fortunate to be in touch with Ross Bowden, an expert on the Kwoma culture, with Colin
Filer, an expert on the Sepik cultures in general, and with Angela Mandie Filer, a sociologist
and herself a Kwoma. Contact with Laurie Bragge, an ex-District Oﬃcer in the Ambunti
area—whose knowledge of the ethnohistories of the Sepik people is truly unsurpassable,—
was precious. Paul Roscoe, an expert on Ndu cultures, and Ulrike Claas, an expert on the
Sepik area, provided valuable references and feedback. I would like to acknowledge my debt
to them.
   Various people read through drafts of various chapters and commented on them. I am
particularly grateful to Matthew Dryer, Nicholas Evans, Bill Foley, Spike Gildea, John Hajek,
Darja Hoenigman, Gerd Jendraschek, Edit Moravcsik, Andrew Pawley, Vera Podlesskaya,
Alan Rumsey, Hilário de Sousa, and Tonya Stebbins. Gerrit Dimmendaal’s expertise in
phonology and phonetics was instrumental in helping Pauline Laki and myself work out the
Manambu vowel system. I greatly proﬁted from frequent interaction with Andrew Pawley,
on various problems in Papuan and Oceanic linguistics. The information on dogs in New
Guinea provided by Jack Golson was invaluable. I also beneﬁted from animated discussions
and information on Iatmul, from Gerd Jendraschek, and from other members of RCLT—Seino
van Breugel, Oliver Iggesen, Mark Post, and Sheena Van Der Mark.
   I would like to acknowledge help and advice from experts in Papuan languages—Alan
Rumsey, Lise Dobrin, Eva Lindström, Karl Franklin, Les Bruce, Darja Hoenigman, and also
Lila San Roque, Ngawae Mitio, Carol Priestley, John Roberts, Tida Syuntaro, Borut Telban,
Ken Sumbuk, and Lourens de Vries. The late Otto Nekitel supported this work, and we still
mourn him.
   I will always be grateful to Tom Dutton—a remarkable teacher of Tok Pisin, and a friend.
I owe a special debt of gratitude to my friends and colleagues in the Summer Institute of
Linguistics at Ukarumpa and Wewak, for their hospitality and their willingness to share
xviii    Acknowledgementsinformation and ideas—René van den Berg, Steve Parker (with whom I could also share ideas
about the Arawak family), Bob and Selma Bugenhagen, as well as Ken Nayau and Robin and
Marva Farnsworth. Cindi and Jim Farr are and will always remain my very special friends—
words will never be enough to express my gratitude to them.
   Invaluable comments on almost every page came from R. M. W. Dixon, without whose
constant encouragement, enthusiasm, criticisms, and support this grammar would never have
eventuated.
   A debt which can never be over-estimated is to Professor Michael Osborne, who welcomed
the Research Centre for Linguistic Typology to La Trobe University and, while he was Vice-
Chancellor, inspired us to create an intellectual atmosphere of the highest quality, commencing
in 2000 and continuing until 2007. This grammar was written within that stimulating ambience.

        Organization and Cross-referencesThis grammar has been written as an integrated whole. To understand what follows one needs
to have digested what precedes. Chapter 1 provides a quick overview of the main points of the
Manambu grammar. Later chapters deal with a particular grammatical topic each.
   Chapter 3 discusses the ways in which grammatical relations are expressed. This chapter
is basic for understanding the rest of the grammar. Chapter 2 contains a detailed discussion
of phonology; it is not necessary to read to understand the rest of the grammar. Chapter 4
gives an overview of all the word classes, and Chapter 11 concentrates on the organization
of verbal morphology, giving a preview of Chapters 12–17. Chapters 18 and 19 deal with
complex clauses. Chapter 20 draws together the structure of clausal constituents, clauses, and
sentences, and discusses the principles and functions of constituent order and of order of
grammatical words within each constituent. Issues in semantics are addressed in Chapter 21.
Those interested in cultural background and historical and comparative problems are advised
to focus on Chapters 1 and 22.
   Examples are numbered separately for each chapter. Examples from texts at the end of the
grammar are referred to with the letter T followed by the number of the text and the sentence
(that is, T2.40 refers to sentence 40 of Text 2).
   All the examples and texts are supplied with an interlinear morpheme gloss, and then trans-
lated into English. Homophonous morphemes are diﬀerentiated by their glosses. The symbol
‘+’ is used to indicate fused morphemes, e.g. taba- is glossed as ‘hand+lk’, its underlying form
being ta:b ‘hand’ (with the long vowel shortened when the linker is added) and -a- ‘linker’.
Portmanteau morphemes are glossed with ‘:’, for instance, mæy ‘come:impv’. All grammatical
morphemes are glossed in small caps while lexical morphemes are in lower case. Pronominal
preﬁxes are shown as 1sg, 3pl, in lower case. For polysemous morphemes, diﬀerent translations
in glosses correspond to diﬀerent meanings.
   Cross-references are of two kinds:
  r Those preceded by § refer to chapter and section number: for instance, §11.1 refers to
    section 1 of Chapter 11;
  r Those beginning with a number refer to examples in the grammar: for instance, 11.1 refers
    to example 1 in Chapter 11.
        Abbreviations and ConventionsHere and passim ‘-’ stands for any morpheme boundary, that is, a boundary between a root
and an aﬃx, or between two roots. The symbol ‘=’ indicates a boundary between a root and a
clitic, or an aﬃx and a clitic, or two clitics (see Chapter 2). The symbol ´ indicates a primary
stress, and ` a secondary stress (obligatory on enclitics). Stress is marked on each example in
Chapter 2 (‘Phonology’) and in other chapters only if relevant to the discussion.
   Manambu has a certain amount of variation between allophones (discussed in Chapter 2).
Many variants depend on the age of the speaker. Examples reﬂect the recurrent individual
variants which also appear in the Vocabulary at the end of the grammar (e.g. kamna:gw, kamna:
‘food’, numa, n@ma ‘big’). Examples throughout the grammar are given in their phonological
representation. Conventions of transcription are addressed in Chapter 2. Loans and code-
switches from Tok Pisin and English are italicized in each example throughout the grammar
(in Chapter 22, Tok Pisin words are italicized and English words are underlined).","[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25]"

                         6.2.4 Markedness in the number systemDual and plural are quite transparent in their semantics. Plural agreement always signals a
plural referent, and dual agreement indicates that there are just two participants. There is just
one exception. A noun phrase with the numeral mugul ‘three; few’ can trigger dual agreement,
if the numeral mugul means ‘few (two or three)’, as in 6.40. The same principles apply, no
matter whether the head noun has an animate referent or not.
                                                                   6.2 Number agreement           1436.40 k@-b@r         laulap mugul        k@-di
     dem.prox-du banana three/few eat-3plbas.p
     ‘After they have eaten a few (two or three) bananas . . . ’
  If a noun phrase with mugul refers to exactly three entities, the agreement is plural: 6.41 is
about having exactly three classiﬁcatory mothers.
6.41 k@-di         amæy mugul t@-da-l-a
     fem.prox-pl mother three have-3plsubj.p-3fem.sgbas.p-3fem.sgnom
     ‘This is how they had these three mothers’
Dual agreement with mugul in the meaning of ‘a few’ suggests that, at an earlier stage, the
dual number in Manambu could have had the meaning of ‘paucal’, referring not necessarily
exactly to two entities, but rather to a small number of entities. The forms and semantics of
dual agreement in Ndu languages are considered in Aikhenvald (forthcoming b).
  Plural agreement is used in a variety of further contexts. Plural agreement is the unmarked
choice in content questions if the speaker has no idea about the sex or the quantity of people
they are asking about, as in 6.42.
6.42 s@  kulapu-na-di
     who clean-act.foc-3plbas.vt
     ‘Who cleaned (the path)?’
  Along similar lines, the question in 6.43 contains a plural form of ‘child’, and yet the answer
could be in the singular—that is, the plural is used as a kind of cover term for all numbers. This
choice may also have to do with the semantics of the interrogative quantiﬁer kas which implies
a non-singular quantity.
6.43 d@-k@-m    ñan-ugw kas?
     he-obl-loc child-pl how.many/much
     ‘How many children does he have?’
   A ﬁnal piece of evidence in favour of plural being less marked functionally than dual comes
from mistakes and slips of the tongue. It is not infrequent for any speaker to mistake dual
participants for plural. In 6.44, the speaker is talking about two people. She ﬁrst uses dual, and
then refers to them with plural; later on she corrects herself again.
6.44 abra                   waku-b@r,        waku-di       waku-b@r
     dem.dist.react.top+du go.out-3dubas.p go.out-3plbas.p go.out-3dubas.p
     ‘The two went out, (many) went out, two went out’
   Mistakes like this are always ‘in favour’ of plural. It is as yet too early to say that the dual is
on its way out. However, these examples may indicate that within non-singular numbers, plural
is less functionally marked than the dual.
        7        Case Marking
                      7.1 f o r m at i o n o f c a s e s : a n ov e rv i ewManambu has a system of nine case forms. One can distinguish nine cases each corresponding
to a form. By their functions and meanings, one can distinguish eighteen cases. At the end of
this chapter, we argue for an intermediate solution.
   Core cases mark grammatical relations on a basic object–non-object principle (see §3.2).
Table 3.5 summarizes the principles of dependent marking on nouns, and how these correlate
with the cross-referencing of arguments on verbs as heads of predicates. All cases, except for the
comitative, can only be marked once per NP. Case markers occur on the head of an NP (which
is, in most instances, also the last word in the NP; the few exceptions include comitative, and
NPs with cardinal numbers, such as ‘three’ in 7.50, and quantiﬁers: see §§10.5–6; §20.1.1). Case-
marked forms, and Ø-marked nouns, are underlined throughout this chapter. Some cases can
occur on verb stems and forms: see §7.11.
   Case markers attach to a linker whose choice depends on the subclass of nouns (§4.1.1). The
sequence of linker -a and the V in accusative-locative, dative, and allative-instrumental cases
results in a long vowel a:. If the linker is @, the V of the case marker disappears. Third person
singular and dual pronouns and the interrogative s@ ‘who’ take the oblique marker -k@- as a
linker (homophonous with the possessive marker -k@- discussed in §8.2).
                 7.2 f unct ions of a noun unmarked for caseA noun unmarked for case appears as (A) A/S and copula subject, (B) copula complement,
(C) the second argument of verbs of ‘turning into’; (D) object; (E) manner; (F) locations;
(G) purpose; (H) instrument; and also (I) nominal component of complex verbs. Topics and
afterthoughts also appear unmarked, no matter what function they are in.
A. Subjects (A/S and copula subjects) do not receive any formal marking, as shown in 4.16–17,
4.35–6, and 7.1 below. All subjects are cross-referenced on the verb (see §3.1). Their subject
properties (including behaviour in clause chaining) are summarized in §20.1.4.
B. Copula complements are also formally unmarked (see §7.9, for one exception); unlike other
non-subject arguments, they are never cross-referenced on the verb, as shown in 3.8–9 and 7.1
(also see discussion of copula verbs under B in §4.2.2).7.1 [br@-k@-b@r    amæy asa:y kiya-br@-k]             kwakuliCC ya-n      t@-b@r
    3du-poss-3du mother father die-3du-compl.ds orphan           come-seq stay-3dubas.vt
    ‘After their mother and father died, the two came to be orphans’C. The second argument of the verbs of change of state and turning into is formally unmarked
and not cross-referenced on the verb, as illustrated in 3.10, 7.2, and 15.116.
                                               7.2 Functions of a noun unmarked for case          1457.2 ta:kw2nd.argument saw@l-na                             ya
    woman             be.transformed-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt emph
    ‘(The mango) turned into a woman’
   These verbs are similar to copula verbs in that their second argument (which denotes a kind)
is obligatory and cannot be cross-referenced on the verb itself.
D. An object can be formally unmarked if it is indeﬁnite, non-referential, or generic, as in 3.14,
4.31–2, and 7.3, or its complete involvement in the activity is not in focus, as in 4.29–30 and
4.34–6. A topical object can be cross-referenced in the second position (see §3.1).
7.3 wun wali-kamna:gw ak@s            k@-kwa-na-wun
    I     white.people-food neg.hab eat-hab-act.foc-1sgbas.vt
    ‘I never eat white people’s food’
   In idiomatic expressions the object is always unmarked, as in T1.4 and 7.16, bap v@-
‘menstruate’, literally ‘see moon’. The object of the verb nay- ‘play’ is always unmarked, e.g.
politics nay- ‘play politics’, t@ p@t@ p@ka:u nay- (diving play) ‘play at diving’; it cannot be cross-
referenced.
   If the focus is on the activity (and this is marked with action focus -na-), the object is likely
to be unmarked:
7.4 [wun-a-di kaukau]        b@      luku kur-na-di
    I-lk-pl    sweet.potato already steal get-act.foc-3plbas.vt
    ‘They already stole my sweet potatoes’
   This is in contrast to 3.15 and 7.17 where the case-marked referents are completely involved
in the activity (see §7.3). Personal pronouns and proper names are usually case marked, unless
the grammatical relations are clear from the context. An example like 7.5 or 10.64 is unusual
(it was a cry of surprise by Gemaj when she realized I was carrying water into the house):
7.5 wun ñ@n ma: v@
    I     you neg see+neg
    ‘I didn’t see you!’E. A noun referring to the manner in which an action is performed appears unmarked for
case, as in 7.6. The manner is the topic, and so it is cross-referenced on the verb in the second
cross-referencing position. Manner is typically feminine (see §5.2.1).
7.6 sad-@-sa:d kur-l@-l
    way-lk-way got-3fem.sgsubj.p-3fem.sgbas.p
    ‘It was in a variety of ways that she (cassowary) got him (the human child)’
In 7.7, the crocodile surfaces in diﬀerent form, disguised as diﬀerent beings. These forms are
what this stretch of the text is about, which explains the feminine cross-referencing on the verb.
7.7 [kwasa-d@       ñan mu]           ata gwa:s karu       ba:u
    small-masc.sg child crocodile then turtle mudgroper scaly.mudgroper
    adawur                    war-d@-l
    dem.dist+masc.sg+up come.up-3masc.sgsubj.p-3fem.sgbas.p
    ‘Having come up as a ﬁsh, he came up as a baby crocodile, in the form of a turtle, a small
    ﬁsh, a big ﬁsh, in these forms he came up’
146     7 Case Marking   The semantics of the ‘manner’ oblique is reminiscent of the second argument of verbs with
the meaning ‘turn into’ (under C above). While the second argument of such verbs is obligatory
(that is, a sentence like 7.2 would be ungrammatical without it), form and manner in 7.6–7 are
optional.
F. Nouns referring to location, direction, and provenance can occur unmarked for case. This is
typical for inherently locational nouns and place names (see §4.1.2), as in 4.1, 7.8, and 13.34,
or if the direction is obvious, as in 4.56.
7.8 [atab@k-@     ta:kw] [k@-d@                 t@p] ma: ku
    that+like-lk woman dem.prox-masc.sg village neg stay:neg
    ‘There are no women like this (in) this village’
   A noun which is not inherently locational can occur without locative marking if it obviously
refers to a location, as in 7.9 (‘nose’ of a canoe):
7.9 tapwuk ta:m yayib              mal@-m         abra
    rooster nose tree.kangaroo stern+lk-loc dem.dist.react.top+du
    yi-na-b@r
    go-act.foc-3dubas.vt
    ‘The rooster on the nose (of the canoe), the tree kangaroo on the stern, the two went’
  An unmarked noun can refer to direction, as in 7.10, and to provenance ‘from’, as in 7.11, if
these meanings are recoverable from the context and the verbs have directional semantics.
7.10 [n@k@-d@      tama:y nak] ada
     other-masc.sg point one dem.dist.react.top.masc.sg
     wula-na-d
     come-act.foc-3masc.sgbas.vt
     ‘(Onto) another point, one (more bandicoot) comes in’
7.11 al@k        wi    waku-dian
     this.is.why house go.out-1plbas.vt
     ‘This is why we went out (of) the house’
  Inherently temporal nouns often occur unmarked, as in 4.3.
G. Nouns expressing purpose can be unmarked if the purpose meaning is clear from the
context, as in 7.12a; in this cases dative case would be expected, as in 7.12b (see §7.4).
7.12a na:gw ma: y@
      sago neg go:neg
      ‘One didn’t go for sago’ (during the Japanese occupation)
7.12b nagw@-k       yi-kwa-na-di
      sago+lk-dat go-hab-act.foc-3plbas.vt
      ‘They used to go for sago’
  Nominalizations in -ka:u occur unmarked (see §9.1.2):
7.13 kak@l-ka:u yi-k-na-b@r
     surpass-nom go-fut-act.foc-3dubas.vt
     ‘They two were about to go for races’H. Instruments can occur unmarked if the instrumental meaning is clear from the context, as
in 7.14:
                                                               7.3 Accusative-locative case         1477.14 ta:b kayk@t@-n
     hand hold/lean-seq
     ‘Holding (him with) a hand’A formally unmarked noun can be used to describe a property of an inanimate entity, as in
17.63–4, e.g. day yi v@r-k-na (mouth ﬁre burn-fut-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt) ‘Mouth will burn’
(lit. burn in terms of ﬁre) (if you eat hot pepper).
   Functions E–H correspond to oblique arguments, none of which is required by the verb’s
argument structure.
I. Nominal components of complex verbs are always unmarked and never cross-referenced on
the verb. As shown in §4.1.2, these nominal components are often body parts, e.g. s@ p ‘skin’
in s@p ji- and s@p sakwi- both meaning ‘be fed up’, or states, e.g. ka:m ‘hunger’, as in ka:m
yas- ‘feel hunger’, and s@ ‘sleep’ as in s@ kwa- ‘be asleep’ and s@ yasa- ‘feel sleepy’. Other
nouns include gu ‘water’ in gu yaku- (water wash) ‘bathe; wash oneself’, sua:l ‘lie, story’ in
sua:l kur- (lie do) and sua:l taka- (lie put) ‘tell a lie’, and yanu ‘magic’ in yanu bla- (magic talk)
‘cast a magic spell’. (Similar constructions, e.g. gu ya:ku- ‘wash’, are attested in Iatmul: Gerd
Jendraschek, p.c.)
   The nominal component cannot be cross-referenced on the verb. Unlike any other argument,
it cannot be questioned, focused, or negated separately. One cannot ask ‘what is she putting’,
and receive a reply ‘a lie’; one cannot say ‘it is a lie that she is putting’. This is because it is not
part of the verb’s argument structure. Further analysis of complex verbs is in §17.3.
Topics and afterthoughts occur unmarked, no matter what functions they are in. In 4.35, ‘child’
is an afterthought, and is separated from the rest of the clause with a pause. Case markers are
mutually exclusive with derivational suﬃxes -d@ka ‘only’, -r@b ‘fully’, -p@k ‘like’, and -k@r @b
‘together’, as in 10.147. (See §9.2.)
   The functions and meanings of formally unmarked nouns in Manambu are summarized
in Table 7.1. Zero-marked nouns vary in terms of their functions discussed above and (1) how
obligatory they are; (2) whether they can or cannot be cross-referenced on the verb; (3) whether
they can alternate with a case-marked noun; and (4) whether they can be replaced with an
unmarked personal pronoun.
   We conclude that zero-case marking in Manambu has nine diﬀerent meanings and functions
corresponding to the contexts A–I outlined here. Nouns in contexts A–E can be consid-
ered zero marked for case since zero is in paradigmatic contrast to segmental marking. In
contrast, nouns in contexts F–H are better considered as formally unmarked since there
is an underlying case form which can be omitted thus producing a surface zero (loca-
tion can be marked with locative case, purpose with dative, and instrument with allative-
instrumental). Not all case markers can be omitted: there are no unmarked comitatives,
transportatives, or substitutives. Components of complex verbs are not special grammatical
relations.

      Personal pronouns are typically case marked, as shown in 7.15 (7.5 is highly unusual).
7.15 wun-a:m         m@n      karda    ma: ta:y
     I-lk+acc/loc you:masc bring+down neg ﬁrst
     ‘You will not carry me down ﬁrst’
  (ii) If the direct object is completely involved in the action, or completely aﬀected by it, it is
       likely to be case marked. In 3.15 and T1.8, the man is planning to exterminate the moon,
       that is, to fully kill her. The moon is marked with the accusative-locative. In contrast,
       ‘moon’ in the object function in an idiomatic expression, as in 7.16, is unmarked.
7.16 yala-wa       t@-ta:y          ak@s       bap v@-kwa-na-di
     belly+lk-com stand-cotemp neg.hab moon see-hab-act.foc-3plbas.vt
     ‘When one is pregnant (lit. with a belly) one does not menstruate (that is, see the moon)’
  In 7.17, the object is completely involved: the spirit is known to eat children up completely:
7.17 dakul wapi du-a-ñanugw-a:m              k@-da:-di
     spirit bird man-lk-children-lk+acc/loc eat-3plsubj.p-3plbas.p
     ‘The spirit birds ate up male children’
In all these instances the accusative-locative case is in paradigmatic opposition with a zero-
marked object. We now consider verbs which allow for a choice between accusative-locative,
dative, and zero marking for their second argument.
  (iii) The accusative-locative case with perception ‘see’ and ‘hear’ (see §21.1.2) and ‘ﬁnd, look
        for’ indicates telic action whose result was achieved. In 7.18, the verb kwak@- with an
        accusative-marked object means ‘ﬁnd’.
7.18 [wula-l-a]                             [a              takwa:m]
     come.in-3fem.sgbas.p-3fem.sgnom dem.dist+fem.sg woman+lk+acc/loc
     kwak@-ku
     look.for/ﬁnd-compl.ss
     ‘It is that she came in, after having found that woman’
This verb with an unmarked object refers to atelic action, as in 7.19. Here it means ‘look for’.
7.19 [ñanugw amæy] kwak@-ya-bana
     children mother look.for-come-1plsubj.vt+3fem.sgbas.vt
     ‘We are looking and looking for the children’s mother’
  This same verb with an object marked by dative case has a frustrative overtone of ‘looking
for and not ﬁnding’, as in 7.20:
7.20 [a-d@               kiyak]        kwak@-n      t@-la
     dem.dist-masc.sg key+lk+dat look.for-seq stay-3fem.sgsubj.vt+3fem.sgbas.vt
     ‘She is constantly looking for the key (without ﬁnding it)’
   Verbs of perception, v@ ‘see, look’ and wuk@- ‘hear, listen’, show comparable alternations. A
generic object of ‘see’ is unmarked, as in 7.16. Its O is marked with dative, if the object has
not been seen completely, or intentionally looked at. If the object is fully seen and the action
is volitional and/or telic (meaning ‘look’, or ‘see well’), the object is marked with accusative-
locative—see 4.12. In 7.21 the object is deﬁnite and completely seen and the action is volitional:
150      7 Case Marking7.21 [ [a              w@pak-a:m]                 v@-ku]        a-d@

     road+lk+loc go-proh.gen
     ‘Having seen the tree (whose leaf I put on the ground), do not go on that road’
  In the non-volitional meaning ‘see, notice’, and ‘look around for’, the object is marked with
dative, as in 7.22 (also see 7.28). In 7.22 the head of the village is the topic, and this is why he is
cross-referenced on the verb:
7.22 [ta:y waku-d@           yibun-miya:k]      ata v@-br@-d
     ﬁrst go.out-3masc.sgvt stick-tree+lk+dat then see-3dusubj.p-3masc.sgbas.p
     ‘Then the two looked around for the number one chief (of the village)’
   This meaning of the dative case is consistent with its overtone of future projection: see §13.7.
As shown in §21.1.2, verbs v@- ‘see, look, try, experience’ and wuk@- ‘hear, listen, miss, feel
sorry, obey’ are polysemous. Body parts m@l ‘eye’ and wa:n ‘ear’ are used to diﬀerentiate their
meanings to do with perception: m@l v@- can only mean ‘see, look’, and wa:n wuk@- means
‘hear, listen’. The body parts cannot be cross-referenced on the verb; and a limited number of
constituents can intervene between the body part and the perception verb. The verbs remain
transitive—that is, they can take an object (either case marked or not). These collocations are
similar to complex verbs, and the zero-marked body parts behave like nominal components
in complex verbs (see under I in §7.2). In its meaning of ‘experience’, the verb v@- takes an
unmarked object, as in 7.23 and 21.7.
7.23 m@n          b@       wasa-yuwi       v@-d@m@n            wasa-yuwi     ma:

     v@
     see+neg
     ‘Did you shave yet (have a beard) or did you not shave (when you met Dangwan)?’
  The verb wuk@- with the dative object means ‘listen to, try to hear’, as in T3.27–8 (‘the snake
sat listening for man’s name’ (trying to hear it)). This verb with an object in the accusative-
locative may mean ‘listen to, obey’:
7.24 [atab@k-@ jap@-m]                wuk@-tukwa
     like.this-lk thing+lk-acc/loc listen-proh.gen
     ‘Do not listen to/obey things like this’
   Dative and accusative-locative alternations are also attested with verbs of aﬀect, such as verb
vya- ‘hit, kill’. With an accusative-locative object it implies strong hitting and especially killing
(that is, hitting the victim until they die, as in 3.15 and T1.8). In 7.25, the mother asks the child
if anyone has attempted to hit her just slightly, and so the object is in dative case. The mother
knows that no one has hit the child, and the child is crying for no reason at all.
7.25 s@-k@-lal                   ñ@n-a:k         vya-na
     who-obl-fem.sg+3fem.sgnom you.fem.sg-lk+dat hit-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt
     ‘Who is it who hit at you?’
  (iv) The accusative-locative case can mark a number of other arguments, including the third
       argument of ditransitive verbs if it is topical and includes all the recipients, as in 7.26;
       or if the beneﬁciary or maleﬁciary is fully aﬀected, as in 7.34 (‘for us’ in ﬁrst line).
                                                            7.3 Accusative-locative case       1517.26 Gala Waskuka:m            ta:kw kra-di
     Gala Washkuk+lk+acc/loc wife marry-3plbas.p
     ‘Gala married Washkuk (Kwoma) women’ (lit. Gala married women from/of Washkuk)
  If the ‘gift’ is permanent possession, the recipient is marked with accusative-locative case.
The alternative is dative case (which is typically used to mark recipients: see §7.4, and 7.36).
Example 7.27 is a way of referring to a man’s father by birth:
7.27 wun-a:m wus kui-d@                                asa:y
     I-lk+loc penis give.to.third.p-3masc.sgbas.vt father
     ‘the father who gave me penis’ (lit. penis on me)
  This is similar to 7.30 and T1.32 (see below).
  In summary: the accusative-locative case marking on NPs indicates complete involvement
and/or complete aﬀectedness of a second or third argument in the action. The argument is
most often the object, but can also be a recipient or a possessor. The use of this case correlates
with deﬁniteness and animacy, and also focuses on the completion and telicity of the action
and its result (rather than the action itself).
B. Obliques in the function of location and direction are marked with the locative case,
as shown in 7.21, 7.28, and 7.32 (see §7.2 on unmarked location).
7.28 ga:n [d@ ad@da                         gu-a:m           t@-na-d@

     war@-d
     come.up-3masc.sgbas.vt
     ‘At night the man, the water spirit who lives in water, having noticed the canoe, came up’
Locative is also used in constructions of provenance, ‘from’; these are biclausal structures, as in
7.29. Note that while locative case marks location and allative case (§7.5) marks direction, there
is no special ablative case to express provenance. In each of its purely locative uses including
this one, the -Vm case can be replaced with the terminative case if the exact point in time or
space is implied (see §7.6).
7.29 [ak@m        t@-ku]        ya-na-d
     where+loc stay-compl.ss come-act.foc-3masc.sgbas.vt
     ‘Where is he coming from?’ (lit. ‘Where having stayed he come?’)
   The locative case is used with an inherently temporal constituent, if the whole duration of
time is in focus, or an exact point in time referred to, as in 4.4.
   The locative case is also used to mark complete lack of possession, as in 7.30, or complete
involvement, as in 7.34 (‘for us’). The possessor completely aﬀected by the ‘possession’ of, say,
a sickness, as in T1.32, is also marked with locative.
7.30 wun-a:m ma:s         ma: ku
     I-lk+loc betelnut neg stay:neg
     ‘I have no betelnut’
The locative contrasts with the allative whose main meaning is ‘direction towards’ (see 7.49 in
§7.5). However, the diﬀerence goes beyond that. The allative case indicates direction which has
not yet been reached, as in 7.31.
152      7 Case Marking7.31 ada                           war-na-d                  d@-k@-r
     dem.dist.react.top.masc.sg go.up-act.foc-3masc.sgbas.vt he-obl-all
     ‘Here he is climbing onto it (and never got there)’
In contrast, if the action is completed and the destination reached, the locative case is used:
7.32 war-d@-l                            [a                m@d         l@-k@

     m@ñ-a:m]
     breast-lk+loc
     ‘He (the man’s head) went up onto the cassowary’s breast (and stayed there)’
  Using the locative rather than the allative case implies complete coverage of the destination.
In 7.33, hot water was poured all over the woman’s skin, which is marked with locative. A
similar example is in 7.41 (‘jump over you-locative’).
7.33 adika                   [l@-k@             s@p-a:m]

     pour-put-3fem.sgsubj.p-3plbas.vt
     ‘She poured (quantities of hot water) all over her body’
    A locative-marked NP, ‘bad way’, is used in the predicate slot, in a ‘completive’ meaning of
‘it will be absolutely bad for us’.
7.34 ñ@d-@-ñ@d-@r                 yi-k@-k@-bana                            ma: ñan-a:m

     ‘If we get into the middle (of the rainbow), then it will be bad for us, it will be absolutely
     bad (for us)’
Summing up: the accusative-locative case in Manambu can mark (i) obligatory arguments as
well as (ii) obliques. In (i), it is in opposition to zero-marked nouns and to nouns marked with
dative case. In (ii), it is in opposition to allative and to terminative cases. What the two uses
have in common is the meaning of complete involvement of a non-subject constituent (object,
recipient, possessor, location, or direction) and the focus on result. This agrees with the way in
which the same marker is used on verbs. We return to this in §7.11.
                               7.4 dat i v e -av e r s i v e c a s eThe dative case, marked with -Vk, has a wide variety of functions covering (A) addressee and
beneﬁciary; (B) purpose and destination; (C) cause and reason; (D) ‘lest, for fear of’; and (E)
bodily states. We saw in §7.3 (7.20, 7.22, 7.25, and also T3.28) that dative can mark the second
argument of a number of verbs if the argument is not completely aﬀected or the action is atelic.
Dative obligatorily marks the second argument of a number of verbs discussed under (F) below.
   The dative case is highly polysemous. However, to simply say that the dative case always
marks an object which is not primarily aﬀected would be a simpliﬁcation. An argument or an
oblique marked with the dative case can be cross-referenced on the verb. The aversive meaning
of -Vk can be easily shown to ‘derive’ from a more general meaning of the dative as a marker of
                                                                7.4 Dative-aversive case      153second argument of verbs to do with emotions, such as fear. If a dative-marked noun is used in
isolation, it may acquire aversive reading depending on its semantics. The dative marker could
be cognate to the future and purposive markers -(V)k-—we return to this in §7.11.
A. Addressee, or beneficiary of ditransitive verbs, is marked with dative, as shown in 7.35–
6. Also see examples of ‘give’ in §4.2.2.
7.35 d@ [d@-k@             takwa:k]    ata wa-d@-l
     he he-poss+fem.sg woman+lk+dat here say-3masc.sgsubj.p-3fem.sgbas.p
     ‘He spoke like this to his woman’
In 7.36, the topical addressee (not the object ‘shown’) is cross-referenced on the verb, since the
story is about the man.
7.36 ata d@-k@-k      n@k@         yawi s@maka-dana-d
     then he-obl-dat other+fem.sg work show-3plsubj.vt-3masc.sgbas.vt
     ‘Then they showed him another work’
Dative case marks beneﬁciary—that is, person for whom the action is being done:
7.37 d@-k@-d@        yanu ada                        bla-d@-di

     ‘Then he performed his magic for that child’B. Purpose and destination marked with dative case are illustrated in 7.38–9. Example 4.2
illustrates the dative case on a temporal noun (‘for tomorrow’).

  When I asked why Avatip women were so keen on smoking large quantities of ﬁsh, the answer
was sana:k (money+lk+dat) ‘for money’. The purpose of hunting or ﬁshing is usually marked
with dative:
7.40 k@dika                   væki-di                  [k@-d@              mu-a:k]
     dem.prox.react.top+pl go.across-3plbas.p/vt dem.prox-masc.sg crocodile-lk+dat
     ‘These (people) went across for this crocodile (to fetch the trapped crocodile)’
A nominal component of a complex verb ‘do cooking’ can be marked with dative, as in 17.44.
This is the only case this form can take.
C. Cause and reason are also marked with dative. A ﬁght between two women broke out in
front of our house in Avatip. I asked a young boy what was happening. His short answer was
du-a:k (man-lk+dat), meaning ‘because of a man (they are ﬁghting)’.
154      7 Case Marking  ‘Purpose’ and ‘reason’ are often hard to distinguish. The form agw-a jap@-k in 7.41 means
both ‘for what purpose’ and ‘why, for what reason’. An alternative is agw-a:k (which-lk+dat)
‘why, what for’—see §10.4.

     ‘Why/what for would they two be jumping over you?’
  Along similar lines, 7.42 can be interpreted as ‘crying because of his mother (since she hit
him)’, or ‘about his mother (because he misses her)’, or ‘for his mother (for her to come)’.

     mother+lk+dat
     ‘That small child too cried for his mother’D. Aversive ‘lest, for fear of’ is another meaning of the dative case:

     ‘Cover yourself for fear of ﬂies’
  Women worried about me standing underneath a coconut palm would shout: t@ p-a:k!
(coconut-lk+dat) ‘for fear of coconut; beware of coconut!’ When walking on a path for the
ﬁrst time, I was warned: wuk@l, diyak (careful, shit+lk+dat) ‘be careful, (beware) of (dog’s)
shit!’ We will see, in F that the second argument of the verb yaga- ‘be afraid of’ takes dative
case.
E. Bodily states and desires are marked with dative case. We saw in §4.2.2 that the verb t@-
preceded by a body part or a body state noun in dative case refers to something wrong with this
particular body part, e.g. aba:k t@- (head+lk+dat be, stand, have) means ‘be not quite right in
one’s head’; and kam@k t@- ‘be hungry’, as in 7.44. The verb kwa- ‘stay’ is used in a similar way,
as in 7.75.
7.44 [kam@k           t@-k@-dana]                      agw-a:r

     k@-k@-dana-di
     eat-fut-3plsubj.vt-3plbas.vt
     ‘When they are hungry, how will they eat (sago)?’
  By itself, kam@k (for hunger), is easily understood as ‘(he/she/they) is/are hungry’. The
verb ‘say’ accompanied by a noun with an inanimate referent in dative case is interpreted as
‘wanting’ (see §19.5, on speech reports), or intention, as in 7.45a.

  A headless possessive in dative case can have a similar meaning. A little boy desperately
wanted to get hold of his brother’s bow and arrow. This was phrased as:
7.45b [wun-a-br@k] wa:d
      I-lk-du+dat say+3masc.sgbas.p
      ‘He said he wanted the two of mine’ (lit. he said, for the two of mine, i.e. bow and arrow)
                                                                   7.5 Allative and instrumental cases                    155F. Dative marking of the second argument is a feature of a number of verbs of emotions,
the verbs yaga- ‘fear’, bas s@- ‘ask’, kap@- ‘wait’, sa:l yi- ‘be short of something’, warsama- ‘be
cross at someone/something’, suguya- ‘help’, kal@pa- ‘teach’, and a few others:
7.46 d@-k@-k     kap@-n kwa-na-wun
     he-obl-dat wait-seq stay-act.foc-1fem.sgbas.vt
     ‘I am waiting for him’
   The object of wuk@- ‘hear, worry about’ in the meaning of ‘worry about, be sad about’ is
marked with dative case—see 4.11. The objects of verbs of liking—including m@yakw kwa-
‘like’ and its equivalent, a Tok Pisin borrowing laiki- (in 7.47b), a complex verb mawul war-
(inside go.up-) in 7.47c, and mawul kur- (inside get) in 7.71—are marked with dative.
   The polyfunctional verb yasa-/yas@- ‘be of physical state’ (see Table 4.1) can occasionally
occur with its copula complement in dative case. 7.47a–c are used as synonyms:
7.47a agw-a    kamnagw@-k yasa-na-d@m@n
      which-lk food+lk-dat be.of.physical.state-act.foc-2masc.sgbas.vt
      ‘What food would you like?’
7.47b agw-a     kamnagw@-k laiki-na-d@m@n
      which-lk food+lk-dat like-act.foc-2masc.sgbas.vt
      ‘What food would you like?’
7.47c agw-a    kamnagw@-k mawul war-na-d@m@n
      which-lk food+lk-dat inside go.up-act.foc-2masc.sgbas.vt
      ‘What food would you like?’
The dative case also marks theme for verbs of speech—that is, what the talk is about, as in 7.48.
7.48 m@n-a:k             t@p-a      du wa-dana-d@m@n
     you.masc-lk+dat village-lk man say-3plsubj.vt-2masc.sgbas.vt
     ‘Village people talk about you’
The dative case marker -Vk occurs on a few adverbs (see §4.4). The etymologically dative form
of the distal demonstrative a/al, al@k, means ‘this is why, for this reason’. We will see in §18.7
that this form has grammaticalized as a causal marker -l@k ‘because of’ on the verb.
                            7.5 a l lat i v e a n d i n s t ru m e n ta l c a s e sThe same form, -Vr, has two diﬀerent meanings and functions—allative (‘towards’) and instru-
mental. 1 In 7.49 ‘direction’ of motion marked by allative is contrasted to location marked by
locative.
7.49 [makaw      samasa:m ar-a:m           t@-na-di]                [an ar-a:r
     telopia.ﬁsh many       lake-lk+loc stay-act.foc-3plbas.vt 1du lake-lk+all
     yi-t@k]
     go-1duimpv
     ‘There are many telopia-ﬁsh in the lake. Let us two go to the lake’
We saw under B in §7.3 above that locative can also mark direction with an implication that the
destination was fully reached, and also that the whole location was involved. Allative has no
such implications (see 7.31, in contrast to 7.32, with a locative-marked constituent). Allative
    1   -r in the allative-instrumental is often subject to the process of rhotic dissimilation detailed in A1 in §2.6.
156     7 Case Markingis used with directional nouns, such as mapa-taba:r (right-hand+lk+all) ‘to the right’, aki-
tabar (left-hand+lk+all) ‘to the left’, and with demonstratives, e.g. al@-da:r (dem.dist.fem.sg-
down+all) ‘that small (one) downwards’. It is very rarely used with animate nouns. Allative
with time nouns refers to a future time span, as in 7.50:
7.50 [ña:r         mugul] kwa-ku           yi-k-na-bran
     day+lk+all three stay-compl.ss go-fut-act.foc-1dubas.vt
     ‘Having stayed for about three days, we will go away’
  In its second meaning, the -Vr case is typically used with nouns with inanimate referents
used as instruments, e.g. mæn-@r (foot-lk+instr) ‘on foot’, and:
7.51 d@ wa:j mij-a:r                 vya-d@-l
     he eel ﬁsh.spear-lk+instr kill-3masc.sgsubj.p-3fem.sgbas.p
     ‘He killed an eel with a spear’
The instrumental of kudi ‘language’ means ‘in a language’, as in 7.52.
7.52 [t@p-a     kudi-r]           at@ta wa-u
     village-lk language-instr how say-1sgimpv
     ‘How am I to say (this) in the village language?’
   The -Vr case with non-locational inanimate nouns has a preferential instrumental reading:
sana:r (money+lk+all) normally means ‘with money’ rather than ‘towards money’. A few
nouns allow for multiple interpretations. The word kabak has two meanings, ‘stone’ and ‘lot of
money’; the form kabak-@r can be understood either as ‘towards a stone; into a stone’; ‘with a
stone’, or ‘with a lot of money’ (but hardly as ‘towards a lot of money’).
   This case is often used with locational nouns used as a means for reaching a destination:
7.53 asay-wa    da-lwun             Sambri-r           val-a:r
     father-com go.down-1sgbas.p Chambri-all/instr canoe-lk+instr
     ‘I went down with my father, towards the Chambri lakes, on a canoe’
   The form Sambrir is ambiguous: it can mean ‘via the Chambri lakes’, or ‘towards the
Chambri lakes’. This indeterminacy can be resolved only by context, or with an appropriate
question. We will see in §10.4 that question words distinguish allative (akr@l ‘where to?’) and
instrumental (ak@-r (what/where-instr) ‘with what, which way?’ and agw-a:r (which/what-
lk+instr) ‘with what thing, how?’) (as in 7.44).
   The instrumental case with means of transport is synonymous with the transportative cases
(see §7.7), e.g. val-a-r, val-a-sap, val-a-say ‘by canoe, by car’.
   Synchronically speaking, allative and instrumental are better analysed as homonymous cases
rather than two meanings of one, polysemous, case. We saw in §7.3 that locative and allative
are in a paradigmatic opposition. In contrast, instrumental case is not in any paradigmatic
opposition to other cases; it is almost synonymous with transportative cases when used on a
small group of nouns describing means of locomotion or of reaching a destination. In addition,
allative and instrumental meanings are marked diﬀerently in the interrogative system. The -Vr
form occurs on verb roots with the meaning of manner (§7.11).
   The instrumental-allative polysemy is uncommon cross-linguistically. It is attested in a
couple of Australian languages (Dixon 2002a: 168). A formal connection between instrumental
and allative is a feature of various languages of the Sepik area, including a number of Ndu
languages and Kwoma (see Aikhenvald forthcoming b).
                                                                             7.6 Terminative case   157                                     7.6 t e r m i nat i v e c a s eThe terminative case, marked with -Vb, has the meaning ‘exactly on the dot or reaching the
point; to the brim’. In 7.54, a speaker was commenting on how small an Amazonian Indian
was compared to me:
7.54 k@l@b                       t@-na,                 ñ@n-a:k
     dem.prox+fem.sg+term be/have-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt you.fem-lk+dat
     sagwa:b               t@-na
     shoulder+lk+term be/have-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt
     ‘She is up to here, she is up to your shoulder’
Terminative case has similarities with the locative case, with a subsequent change in meaning:
7.55 is a variant of 7.29, but the meaning is ‘where exactly?’ 2
7.55 [ak@b        t@-ku]          ya-na-d
     where+term stay-compl.ss come-act.foc-3masc.sgbas.vt
     ‘Where exactly is he coming from?’ (lit. ‘Where exactly having stayed he come?’)
  Locative and terminative are contrasted in 7.56: the rooster is instructing the rock wallaby
exactly what part of the canoe he wants to be on:
7.56 [m@n      ya:n        mal@m            ada],      [wun ya-n        tama:b
     you.masc come+seq steer+lk+loc stay.impv I              come-seq nose+lk+term
     ta:u]
     stay+1sgimpv
     ‘On the way there, you stay on the stern, let me stay exactly on the nose (of a canoe)’
  The terminative case contrasts with the unmarked form of the noun in 7.57a and 7.57b. The
verb ‘reach’ is transitive.
7.57a kwati ma: n@bay kak@l
      knee neg yet       reach:neg
      ‘(Water) has not reached the knees yet’
7.57b gu    kwatiyib         bu      kak@l-na
      water knee+lk+term already reach-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt
      ‘Water has already reached knees; is exactly knee-high’
  Terminative case can also express direction, as in 7.58:
7.58 [k@-d@             t@p-a:b]       yi-di
     dem.prox-masc.sg village-lk+term go-3plbas.vt
     ‘They went up until this village’
With the noun ma:j ‘talk’, it has the meaning of ‘following the words exactly’, as in 7.59; the
expression maj@b is often used to mean ‘using someone’s exact words’. With temporal nouns,
it implies exact time frame (§4.1.2).
7.59 [d@-ka                         maj@b]     wuk@-ku
     3masc.sg-obl+dem.dist.fem.sg word+lk+term listen-compl.ss
     ‘Having obeyed his words exactly’
                  2   Laycock (1965) erroneously treated -b case in Manambu as an ablative.
158     7 Case MarkingA suﬃx of the same form appears in manner adverbs (§4.4), where it is often accompanied by
reduplication, e.g. m@y-a-m@y-a:b (real-lk-real-lk+term) ‘for real, fully well and truly’.
                              7.7 t ra n s p o rtat i v e c a s e sTwo transportative cases occur with a limited group of nouns, and are similar in their meanings.
The markers are -Vsap and -Vsay; both are used with nouns referring to means of locomotion
or of reaching a destination. Their meaning overlaps with the instrumental -Vr (see §7.5). The
form -say appears to be more frequent than -sap. See 7.60–1.
7.60 gu-jabra-sap           ya-na-wun
     water-boat+lk-transp come-act.foc-1fem.sgbas.vt
     ‘I come by water-raft’
7.61 [a              kiya:l          br@ka                       amæy] ata

     kar-asay       ya:l
     car-lk+transp come/go+3fem.sgbas.vt
     ‘That dead mother of them two then came by car’
   The sentence in 7.61 is followed by 7.62, where the meaning ‘by car’ is marked with the
allative-instrumental. This shows similarity in meanings of the allative and the transportative:
7.62 [kar-a:l    waku-n]      ata p@una-l             mat@mat-@-m
     car-lk+all go.out-seq then appear-3fem.sgbas.vt cemetery-lk-loc
     ‘Going out by car, she appeared at the cemetery’
   The marker -say can also be used with locations such as waterways used as means of getting
from one place to another, as in 7.63:
7.63 alawur             Kabla-say                 da:d
     dem.dist.fem.sg+up Screw.River+lk-transp go.down+3masc.sgbas.vt
     ‘He went down from up there via Screw River’
   Both markers can be used with other means of getting from one place to another: one
can say yab-@-say or yab-@-sap ‘by road’, n@b-@-say or n@b-@-sap ‘by dry land’. With some
words, only -say was considered acceptable and produced spontaneously: p@takau-say (ladder-
transp) was judged to be synonymous with p@takaur (ladder+instr) ‘by ladder’; but ∗p@takau-
sap was rejected. The marker -say was also used on an interrogative, in 7.64; -sap was judged
strange in this context. The answer was: with a ladder. An alternative would have been agw-a:r
(what/which-lk+instr) ‘with what, how?’
7.64 wun ak@-say              da-u
     I   what/where-transp go.down-1sgimpv
     ‘How (lit. with which means) shall I go down?’
  Neither case can occur on personal pronouns or demonstratives. There is a lookalike -sap
used with one word, yanu ‘magic’; yanu-sap means ‘by way of or through magic’. Whether the
two are related or not is an open question. According to the intuition of some speakers, they
are homonyms.

     ‘In the absence of protein food they went out (to ﬁsh) in the Sepik River’  In 7.67, the case marker appears in a headless possessive structure, ‘instead of hers’:7.67 l@-k@-di-yæy      Sirunki adika                  n@n@m

     ‘Instead of her (own ﬁshes), Sirunki put those (previously mentioned) on the smoking

form can be used this way.7.68 kad-ad                             wun-a        ñamus-@-yæy-ad

relations of nouns within an NP, alongside two non-core clausal functions: (b) an associated
participant and (c) location ‘along something’. It can also (d) mark the copula complement
of t@- ‘have, be, become, stand’. It appears to have developed into (e) a derivational suﬃx
meaning ‘all together’. And there appears to be a link between the comitative marker -wa and
the connective wa (mentioned in §4.5, and §20.1.1). We discuss these uses of the comitative one
by one.
   The major grammatical diﬀerence between the adnominal comitative and the comitative
used for clausal functions is the placement of the case marker. The marker of coordinating
comitative within an NP occurs on the ﬁrst constituent in an NP. If the comitative marks a
clausal function, it occurs on the last word of the NP, like other case markers discussed so
far. Adnominal comitative can be marked twice within an NP, expressing simultaneity and
‘togetherness’ of the participants.
160     7 Case Marking   The comitative marker -wa attaches to the linker, just like any other case. The only anomaly
is the comitative formed on s@ ‘who’: the comitative is s@ka:wa ‘with whom?’ rather than ∗s@-
k@-wa, as would be expected following the analogy of d@ ‘he’, d@-k@-wa ‘with him’.
A. Coordinating comitative is the most common means of coordinating two nouns within
one NP. Three options are available here:
A1. Comitative marked once in an np is used to coordinate any two nouns whose referents are
closely linked together, e.g. as co-participants in a story, such as tapwuk-a-wa yayib (rooster-
lk-com rock.wallaby) ‘rooster and rock wallaby’, waj@-wa sakibag (eel+lk-com wild.taro) ‘eel
and wild taro’, ñanugw-@-wa ta:kw (children-lk-com woman) ‘women and children’, or Y@san-
a-wa Mayau (Yessan-lk-com Maio) ‘people from Yessan and from Maio’ (representatives of
one group live next door to each other and speak the same language). The expression s@r-a-wa
mu: (tomorrow-lk-com day.after.tomorrow) means not just ‘tomorrow and the day after’, but
can refer to ‘next few days’ as a whole. In contrast, a list of disparate entities does not require
a coordinator.
   A coordinating comitative requires dual or plural agreement on the possessive, e.g. Wargab-
a-wa Wapanab d@ya-k@-di a:s (Wargab.clan-lk-com Wapanab.clan they-obl-pl dog) ‘dog
(names) belonging to the Wargab and the Wapanab clans (lit. Wapanab and Wargab their
names of dogs)’, and on the verb, as in 7.69. (Another example of agreement of coordinate
comitatives with demonstratives, ‘his (two) bow and arrow’, is in 7.71).
7.69 [a              takwa-wa          l@-k@       ñan] ata kwa-b@r
     dem.dist+fem.sg woman+lk-com she-obl+fem.sg child then stay-3dubas.vt
     ‘The woman and her child then stayed (there)’
If more than two nouns are coordinated, there are two options: the second and the third nouns
can be juxtaposed to the comitative marked noun, as in 7.70.
7.70 [Kuimag-a-wa Sirunki Lai] ata ya-di
     Kuimag-lk-com Sirunki Lai then come-3plbas.vt
     ‘Kuimag, Sirunki, and Lai came then’
Alternatively, the connective wa can be used, e.g. Elizabet-a-wa Paul wa br@-k@ ñan Sandra
(Elizabeth-lk-com Paul and 3du-obl+fem.sg child Sandra) ‘Elizabeth, Paul, and their daugh-
ter Sandra’. The latter option is dispreferred by older and more traditional speakers. In each
case, the plural agreement on the verb indicates that the coordinate NP is one constituent.
   There are no restrictions on the function of an NP containing a coordinating comitative of
types A1 and A2. Example 7.71 is an example of an adnominal comitative on the ﬁrst word of
the two NPs, and the dative and the accusative-locative at the end of the respective NPs.

noun phrase); note that the case markers go onto diﬀerent words within an NP constituent.
Coordinate comitative NPs are pronounced as one intonation unit, without a pause. The word
order is ﬁxed, and the NP cannot be split.
A2. Comitative in comitative-marked argument elaboration constructions was discussed
in §6.2.3. The major diﬀerence between such constructions with and without comitative is the
equality of participation: the comitative-marked participant is somewhat backgrounded (see
6.37–9). For innovative speakers highly proﬁcient in Tok Pisin, the comitative postpositions
wuk@n ‘with, together’ (as in 4.69–70 and 7.72) and nakamib (as in 6.39) are synonymous with
the comitative.
   A comitative-marked inclusory construction can be in any case function. The case marker
goes onto the cover pronoun, as shown in 7.72. This is in contrast to most other types of NP:
7.72 kus@-d@-k                 aw [an-a:k             wun-a-wa Yuakalu wuk@n]
     die-3masc.sg-compl.ds then we.two-lk+dat I-lk-com Yuakalu together
     an-a:k            kap@-n t@-da-l                         aka
     we.two-lk+dat wait-seq stay-3plsubj.p-3fem.sgbas.p dem.dist.react.top.fem.sg
     ‘After he died, that time they waited for us two, me and Yuakalu’
  The word order within the NP is ﬁxed, just as in A1 above.
A3. Double comitative occurs in an NP consisting of two nouns marked with the comita-
tive referring to one participant or event which can be in any function in a clause. Saying
t@p-a-wa kapayawi-a-wa k@-k-na-wun (coconut-lk-com sweet.potato-lk-com eat-fut-act.foc-
1sgbas.vt) means ‘I will eat coconut and sweet potato together’ referring to eating them
simultaneously (with shaved coconut spread on the sweet potato). In 7.73, m@r @-wa 3 wala-
wa (strong.wind+lk-com rain+lk-com) ‘hurricane; strong wind and heavy rain happening
simultaneously’ triggers singular agreement on the verb. That wa:l ‘rain’ is the head of the
construction is corroborated by the choice of the weather verb j @- ‘to rain’ (see §4.2.2) which
can only be used with ‘rain’, and not with any other phenomenon:

     ‘Then there was (lit. rained) a heavy rain with simultaneous wind’
   If the two participants are animate, the agreement on the verb is non-singular, as in T3.52
(‘Oselo and the snake the two together died that night’). This is not an inclusory construction:
the double comitative is one NP, and the ‘two together’ is another. There is an intonation break
between the two NPs.
   A double comitative construction can consist of any nouns, e.g. amæy-@-wa ñ@n@-wa
(mother-lk-com child+lk-com) ‘mother and child together’, and even of pronouns: when I
showed a picture of myself with Kulanawi, his reaction was: ñ@n-a-wa wun-a-wa! (you.fem-lk-
com I-lk-com) ‘you and me together!’ A double comitative construction does not allow any
other case morphology on the same NP.
B. Comitative as associated participant is an oblique, meaning ‘together with’; it is never
cross-referenced on the verb. Unlike adnominal comitative, the marker of the comitative of
associated participant goes on the head of an NP. The comitative-marked NP can be placed
before the verb or after it depending on its topicality: in 7.74 it is postposed to the verb.
         3   The @ in the sequences @-w and @-y may not be pronounced at all in normal speech register.

     ‘No, my father said no for me to go down with you’
Comitative on nouns with inanimate referents marks a concomitant object: kwara-wa naya-d
(grass.skirt+lk-com play-3masc.sgbas.vt) means ‘he (a transvestite boy) played with a grass
skirt on’ (also see 14.105). Similarly, a comitative on a noun denoting weather condition implies
‘at the same time as’. Damel gave the following explanation for her visiting our house rather
than going to work in the garden:
7.75 [wala-wa       yawi kur-ku]          ata     bar@k           kwa-k@r
     rain+lk-com work do-compl.ss neg.des fever+lk+dat stay-des
     ‘I don’t want to get fever after having worked during the rain’
   The comitative also marks a participant in an inherently reciprocal action, such as ‘mixing,
putting together’ in T3.20 and ﬁghting (‘with him’) in 7.71 (third line).
   If a clause contains an oblique comitative, and the subject is acting alone, the verb acquires
singular cross-referencing, as in 7.76: the man is going to ﬁght with the moon, but there is no
indication that the moon will ﬁght back.

Dual or plural agreement is required if the participants act together, as in 7.77.

     ‘His father with another man, with a dog then went’
   The placement of the comitative and the presence of intonation break in between the NPs
and enumerating intonation in 7.77 show that this is not an instance of coordinating comitative.
   Comitative often indicates reciprocal activity, without the overt reciprocal marker awarwa as
in 7.78. The form awar-wa is in itself a comitative form of awar ‘side, sideways direction’ (also
see §§4.4, 16.2.4).
7.78 d@-k@-wa     karkwas t@-na-bran
     he-obl-com quarelling have-act.foc-1dubas.vt
     ‘I am quarrelling with him’ (lit. we-two with him are quarrelling)
The reciprocal often warrants using comitative on each of the participants to stress that the
action is mutual, as in 7.79. This ‘double’ comitative is diﬀerent from the double comitative
construction in A3 above in that it consists of two NPs separated by a pause. In 7.79, they are
coordinated with the connective wa ‘and’ (also see 16.93b).

The mother complained that her baby was breastfeeding while we were walking along the
road. ‘Road’ and ‘breast’ do not form one NP (there is an intonation break between the two,
and semantically they do not belong together).

  A village submerged under water was described as:

     dem.prox-masc.sg village water-lk-com sit+3masc.sg
     ‘This village is covered with water throughout’
This meaning is obviously linked to ‘together with’, or ‘during’, as in ‘during the rain’ in 7.75.
D. Copula complement of the verb t@- ‘have, be, become, stand’ takes the comitative case in
a few expressions to do with the acquisition of a bodily state, e.g. yala-wa t@- (belly+lk-com
be) ‘become pregnant’ (as in 7.16), and m@ñ-a-wa t@- (breast-lk-com be) ‘acquire breasts (of a
young girl); become adult’.
E. Derivational meaning of the comitative was mentioned in §4.4. A few nouns marked with
the comitative can be used as adverbial-like modiﬁers, with the meaning of ‘all together’, e.g.
du-a-wa (man-lk-com) ‘all the men’, t@p-a-wa (village-lk-com) ‘the whole village’, wiya-wa
(house+lk-com) ‘the whole household’. The meaning is transparent in all these cases, except
for one quantiﬁer: mi ‘tree’ derives miya-wa (tree+lk-com) ‘all together, the whole of’, as in
miya-wa gu ayakw (tree+lk-com water impv+wash) ‘wash/bathe the whole body!’ (also see 6.24
and 16.50). Such forms can modify the action of the verb, as in 7.82. In this example, t@p-a-wa
can also be interpreted as a modiﬁer to the subject ‘they’. The form t@p-a-wa does not form
one NP with ‘they’, because it is an afterthought (separated from the rest of the clause with a
pause).
7.82 d@y nagw@-k        adiya                    ya-k@-na-di           ya,

     t@p-a-wa
     village-lk-com
     ‘They will be coming to fetch sago, as a whole village’
Unlike any other adverbs, such derived comitatives can be used in S (7.83) or O (7.84) function.
7.83 t@p-a-wa        ada                           kus@-na-d

     dem.dist.fem.sg village village-lk-com search-3plsubj.p-3fem.sgbas.p no
     ‘They searched that village through and through the village—nothing’
   A noun in the form of a derivational comitative cannot be modiﬁed, and cannot be referen-
tial. There is a clear semantic link between the derivational comitative and other meanings of
the comitatives, especially the locative ‘throughout’ (as in 7.81).
   The comitative marker occurs on two demonstrative adverbs, k@tawa ‘like this; along here’
(10.47), atawa, and ak@tawa ‘like that’ (see §10.2.2).
164     7 Case Marking  Of all the cases in Manambu, the comitative is the most complex semantically. It can be used
to coordinate nouns within an NP, to mark two oblique functions (concomitant participant
and perlative locative), and one core function (copula complement), and has developed into a
derivational marker.

              9.1.2 Other nominalizations and an adjectivizing derivationNon-productive action nominalizations involve the syllable-weight-sensitive suﬃx -ka:u ‘action
nominalization’: it requires that the root it combines with should contain at least one light and
one heavy syllable (in the sense of §2.4.2). This suﬃx has been attested with one disyllabic root
kak@l ‘surpass, exceed’; the resulting form kak@l-ka:u (surpass-nom.act) means ‘races, compe-
tition’ (as in 9.22). All other roots this suﬃx occurs with consist just of one heavy syllable (of
CVC structure); they have to undergo full reduplication. The resulting forms are g@p-@-g@p-@-
ka:u (run-lk-run-lk-nom.act) ‘running around’, t@p-@-t@p-@-ka:u (dive-lk-dive-lk-der) ‘div-
ing up and down’, and pakw-@-pakw-@-ka:u (hide(intr)-lk-hide(intr)-lk-nom.act) ‘hiding; hide
and seek’. A possible exception is rali-rali-ka:u (untie-untie-der) ‘game of untying (grass skirt)’,
as in kwa:r rali-rali-ka:u nayi-di (grass.skirt untie-untie-nom.act play-3plbas.p) ‘they played

186      9 Derivation and Compoundingat untying grass skirts’. The formative -ka:u in p@t@ka:u ‘ladder’ may also be related to this
morpheme. All the -ka:u derivations refer to a kind of game, or process. These nominalizations
cannot take case marking (see 7.14). They are freely used as heads of predicates as in 9.22, and
express unmarked purpose, as in 7.14. With the verb ‘play’ they refer to the game played, as in
9.23.

     ‘They played at running around (and) diving up and down’
   Unlike any other object it can never be cross-referenced on the verb. In these properties, it is
reminiscent of the nominal component of complex verbs.
   The suﬃx -kay derives an object nominalization from one root, yab@r- ‘fan (somebody)’,
producing yabr@kay ‘fan’. Two suﬃxes occurring with one root each derive adverbs: -sap as
in yanu-sap (magic-der) ‘by magic’ (this suﬃx is homophonous with one of the transportative
case markers: §7.7) and -naral as in takwanaral (woman+der) ‘(row or sit in a canoe) in a
woman’s fashion (for a man)’.
   The inﬁx -ka- ‘intensive’ accompanied by root reduplication is partly a word class-changing
derivation (see Table 4.2, and §4.3.2). It derives non-agreeing adjectives with intensive meaning
from numerous non-agreeing adjectives, e.g. s@mi ‘long’, s@mi-ka-s@mi ‘very long’. A few nouns
take this inﬁx, and the result is, in many cases, a non-agreeing adjective, e.g. laki ‘ginger’, laki-
ka-laki ‘green; ginger colour’. Some nouns refer to colours when used as modiﬁers, e.g. wa:m
‘white cockatoo; white colour’. When used with the inﬁx -ka-, these are used only as non-
agreeing adjectives, e.g. wama-ka-wa:m (white+lk-int-white) ‘very white’. Further examples
are in §4.3.2.
   The inﬁx -ka- when applied to nouns does not always derive an adjective: as mentioned in
§4.3.2, this derivation with ya:l ‘stomach’ results in yala-ka-ya:l (stomach+lk-int-stomach)
‘empty stomach’, as in 4.58.
                  9.2 no n-wo r d c la s s -changing derivationsManambu has a few adverb-speciﬁc derivational suﬃxes (§4.4) and derivational formatives
occurring on personal names (§5.3). Verbal formatives whose status is ambiguous between
derivational suﬃxes and parts of compounds are discussed in §15.2.4.
   Manambu has one non-word class-changing derivational suﬃx, a collective marker -ja:y
which applies just to nouns. This suﬃx has a fairly speciﬁc meaning: it deﬁnes a peer group
or a generation-based group of people, e.g. n@b@-takwa-ja:y (marriageable-woman+lk-coll)
‘young marriageable women’, naubadi-ja:y (young.man-coll) ‘young men’, du-a-ñanugw-a-
ja:y (man-lk-children-lk-coll) ‘a peer group of little boys’, takw-a-ñanugw-a-ja:y (woman-
lk-children-lk-coll) ‘a peer group of little girls’. This suﬃx is also used with kinship terms,
e.g. amay-br@-ja:y (mother-pl-coll) ‘peer group of classiﬁcatory mothers’, asay-br@-ja:y ‘peer
group of classiﬁcatory fathers’, jukwar-ugw@-ja:y ‘peer group of siblings’, ñaju-gwu-ja:y ‘peer
group of paternal uncles’, away-bra-ja:y ‘peer group of maternal uncles’.
   To refer to an exclusive group, the suﬃx -ja:y appears inﬁxed in between the reduplicated
parts of a fully reduplicated noun, as in takwa-ja:y-ta:kw (woman+lk-coll-woman) ‘a group
                                              9.2 Non-word class-changing derivations        187of women only’, ñanugw-a-ja:y-ñanugw ‘a group of children only’, and du-a-ja:y-du (man-lk-
coll-man) ‘a group of men only’.
    Forms containing this suﬃx have plural reference and require plural agreement. The suﬃx
itself requires a plural form of a noun it occurs with (if the noun has one). If the plural form
of a noun is archaic and restricted in usage, it cannot occur with -ja:y, e.g. tid@-takwa-ja:y
(co.wife+lk-woman+lk-coll) ‘peer group of co-wives’ (i.e. women of the same clan who are
either married to the same man, or are eligible to marry men from the same clan), but neither
∗
  tid-igw-ja:y nor ∗ takwagwa-ja:y (though the archaic forms tidi:gw ‘co-wives’ and takwa:gw
‘wives’ exist and occur in songs).
    Note that -ja:y- follows the plural marking in the forms above. This may be considered as
an exception to an oft-quoted tendency to place inﬂectional markers (such as plural) after
derivational markers. However, as shown in §6.1, number marking on nouns themselves in
Manambu is highly restricted and quite irregular. It can be argued that plural on nouns is a
derivation, and not an inﬂection.
    A collective form marked with -ja:y can modify a personal pronoun, as in 9.24; or occur in
S and in an oblique function, as in 9.25.9.24 [ñan kwasa-ñanugw-a-ja:y]               nay-@k      waku-dian

     ‘A group of only men stay in men’s house’   A suﬃx of the same segmental form occurs on the command marker jau ‘let it drop’ (Tok
Pisin maski) resulting in the adverb jau-ja:y ‘any old way, carelessly’. It appears impossible to
decide whether the two ja:y are indeed instances of the same aﬃx, or diﬀerent aﬃxes.
   The unstressed non-productive derivational suﬃx -kara occurs with yara ‘all right’; the
resulting form is yara-kara ‘well’.
   Four further suﬃxes appear to form one morphological system. They can combine with
any word class (that is, they are low in selectivity), displaying somewhat diﬀerent properties
depending on the word class they occur with. Their properties are summarized in Table 9.2.
   All these suﬃxes require a linker (see §4.1.1). Third person singular and dual pronouns
require the linker -k@-, just as with case markers. One grammatical word cannot take more
than one of these suﬃxes—this is an argument in favour of them forming one morphological
system. However, they can occur on diﬀerent words within one NP, as shown in 9.34 below
(similarly to the way in which one noun phrase can contain two cases which occur on diﬀerent
words within one noun phrase, as in 7.71, where one is comitative and the other dative). We
discuss them one by one.
1. The suﬃx -d@ka ‘only, just, exactly’ can occur with members of any word class, with the
basic meaning ‘only, just’, e.g. takwa-d@ka t@p (woman+lk-only village) ‘village of women
only’, m@n-a-d@ka (you.masc-lk-only) ‘you only, just you’. A noun marked with -d@ka can
occur in any function. In 9.26, -d@ka occurs on an O and on a deictic adverb ‘like that’. The
suﬃx is pronounced as -da in rapid register (see §2.6).
   The suﬃx -d@ka ‘only’ is unstressed. When it is added to a noun or a verb, the stress moves
to the antepenultimate position, e.g. a:s ‘dog’, asá-d@ka t@p (dog+lk-only+lk village) ‘village
of only dogs’.

     child-lk-only carry-compl.ss breast+loc
     ‘Just like that, silent, after she was carrying just her son on her breast . . . ’
   The form taba-d@ka (hand+lk-only) ‘hands only, carrying nothing’ can be used in any
function, including a manner modiﬁer, or even as an elliptical greeting, in the meaning of ‘give
me your hand to shake, let’s shake hands’ (a more conventional way of saying the same thing
is ta:b kuru (hand get+1sgimpv) ‘may I take (your) hand’—see §13.2). Only occasionally can
this suﬃx appear on a case-marked noun, as in gan@r-d@ka (night+lk+instr-only) ‘only/just
by night’.
   The suﬃx -d@ka can occur on the ﬁrst of a sequence of nouns repeated for expressive
purposes (§9.3), e.g. gan@-d@ka ga:n (night+lk-only night) ‘only night after night (and never in
daytime)’. This suﬃx occurs on the indicative positive form of the verb root, with the meaning
of ‘do just this’, e.g. waji-d@ka (laugh-only) ‘(he is) just laughing’ (§12.8.1).
   It can also occur on a nominal component of a complex verb, especially if its verbal compo-
nent is clear from the context, e.g. sa:-d@ka (sleep+lk-only) ‘(we will) only (do) sleeping’.
2. The suﬃx -r@ b ‘fully, totally’ occurs on uninﬂected forms of nouns and verbs and is not
compatible with any other inﬂections. A noun marked with -r@ b can occur in any function
except A. In 9.27, it occurs on a noun in an oblique function; in 9.28 it appears on a pronoun
(‘right there’).
9.27 ñ@d-@-ñ@d-@-r@b             adi:d
     middle-lk-middle-lk-fully go.down.impv
     ‘Go down right in the middle (of a ladder)’
  The suﬃx -r@ b is used in lieu of a superlative, e.g. kwasa-r@ b in 9.28. An elder sister is
teaching her younger sister how to shoot birds, and she is telling her to hit the really small
one.
9.28 ata [k@                    kwasa-r@b]NP           a-r@b                      avi
     then dem.prox+fem.sg small+fem.sg-fully dem.dist+fem.sg-fully impv+hit
     ‘(Can I hit it, said (the younger sister), no! (said the elder sister), that is a big one), you
     hit this the smallest one (or: a really small one), right there’
Along similar lines, n@ma kudi-r@ b (big+fem.sg language/voice-fully) means ‘in a really loud
voice’. A headless adjective n@ma-r@ b (big+fem.sg-fully) ‘really big one’ was used to refer to
a very big teacup.
   This same suﬃx is also used to express full identity with another entity. Yuamali’s reaction
to a list of cognates between Manambu and Gala was ñan-a kudi-r@b (we-lk language-fully)
‘(this is) our language fully!’ Similarly, Kulanawi said to me that his son’s name was Michael,
and added 9.29. A similar example is in 9.31.
9.29 ñ@n-a-d@                ñan sa:-r@b
     you.fem-lk-masc.sg child name+lk-fully
     ‘It is exactly like your son’s name’
  Just like -d@ka, -r@b attaches only to the indicative positive stem of a verb (see §12.8.1).
  With personal pronouns, -r@ b may be used somewhat idiomatically to refer to a person’s
wishes. This is the only instance where a form with -r@ b takes nominal cross-referencing in a
190      9 Derivation and Compoundingnon-verbal clause, as in ñ@n-a-r@b-a (you.fem-lk-fully-3fem.sgnom) ‘it is up to you (lit. it is
fully you)’.
3. The suﬃxes -aba:b, -a:b ‘also’ are used with members of any word class, and can attach to
an inﬂected noun or a verb. There are no restrictions on the syntactic function of a noun. In
9.30, -aba:b goes onto the inﬂected verb in the form of predicate focus. That is, -aba:b can have
a whole clause in its scope:9.30 kar-da-k@-m@na:l-aba:b
     carry-down-fut-2masc.sgsubj.vt+3fem.sgbas.vt+3fem.sgnom-too
     ‘It is the case that you took her down, too’   Within a clause, -aba:b and -a:b more often attach to a constituent than to the inﬂected verb.
The diﬀerence between the two suﬃxes is subtle: -a:b is preferred when numerous additional
possibilities are enumerated, that is, when there is more than one additional participant in the
clause. In contrast, -aba:b tends to be used when there is just one additional participant. In
9.31 -a:b (underlined) occurs with enumerated body parts, and -aba:b (bold and underlined)
adds one extra body part (line 3) or participant (line 5):9.31 [a-b@r        l@-k@-b@r       ñ@di      abakapi m@la:b         ma: t@]          [abakapi

     ‘Her two children did not have hawk’s eyes either, they did not have hawk’s nose either,
     they did not have hawk’s feathers either. This, too, the beak, too, is fully like a chicken’s
     beak, both (for) boy and (for) girl; their beards too are fully like chicken’s beards. She,
     too, got the head like (that) of a chicken.’   This example also shows that the linker -k@- can occasionally be omitted (as in l@-aba:b in
the third line). These are the only suﬃxes with long vowels. Given that they do not trigger vowel
shortening in nouns with a long vowel as would be expected for suﬃxes, such as ta:m ‘nose’,
it is possible that these are better treated as clitics (note that they do not acquire secondary
stress).
   The suﬃx -aba:b ‘also’ is probably etymologically related to the quantiﬁer aba:b ‘all’ (see
4.63 and §10.5).
4. The suﬃx -p@k has somewhat diﬀerent meanings depending on the class of word it attaches
to. As shown in Table 4.2 (§4.3.2), it means ‘like’ when used with verbs, ‘more or less; like’ when
used with nouns and other nominals, and is a comparative marker when used with adjectives.
The standard of comparison is not stated; a comparison is implied, as in 4.51 and 9.32
(a continuation of 9.28):
                                              9.2 Non-word class-changing derivations        1919.32 ya:kya, [a                 kwasa-p@k-al]CLEFT.O

     vya-l@-l
     hit-3fem.sg.subj.past-3fem.sg.bas.p
     ‘OK, it was a smaller one (?or the smallest one) that she hit’
  When used with nouns and pronouns, -p@k means ‘more or less, like’, as in 9.33. This was
a question to the oldest living Manambu man, Duamakwa:y, to determine how old he was at
the time of Behrmann’s expedition (see §1.4.2):
9.33 a-d@               Dagwan laku-m@n@-l                          s@-k@-p@k

     be-compl.ss know-2masc.sgsubj.p-3masc.sgbas.p
     ‘At the time when you knew Dangwan, who were you like (in terms of size and age) when
     you knew him?’ (lit. having been like who you knew him?)
   One grammatical word can contain only one suﬃx of the four suﬃxes contrasted in Table 9.2;
but in a noun phrase, one suﬃx can go onto its head and another one can attach to its end, as
in 9.34. The suﬃx -p@k typically attaches to the end of an NP, or a clause, as we will see below.
9.34 t@b-@-d@ka kudi-p@k                 wa-kwa-na
     sky-lk-only language/voice-like say-hab-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt
     ‘It (earthquake) sounds just like the language/voice of thunder’
With the connective atan ‘then’, -p@k means ‘like this, this is how’ (§10.2.2). With a numeral,
-p@k means ‘more or less, approximately’, as in 9.35:
9.35 akwur      l@-k@-k     vitiya-p@k
     impv+get she-obl-dat two+lk-approx
     ‘Give her two (Malay apples) or so’
  A noun or a pronoun accompanied by -p@k can occur in the predicate slot and take personal
cross-referencing, as in 9.36.
9.36 wun aw m@n-a-p@k-awun-@k
     I    then you.masc-lk-like-1fem.sgbas.vt-conf
     ‘Then I am like you’
   A noun with the suﬃx -p@k can take further case suﬃxes, e.g. Malu-p@ka:r yi-di (Malu-
like+lk+all go-3plbas.vt) ‘they went a distance like (the one) from here to the Malu village’.
   When used with a verb, the suﬃx -p@k implies comparison of activity. It then has a whole
clause in its scope—see 14.117, §19.3, and examples there. The suﬃx -p@k does not qualify
as a case marker: it can occur with cases and also, unlike any case-marked forms, a form
marked with -p@k can head a predicate. Unlike other derivational suﬃxes described here, it
is polyfunctional, being used as a derivational suﬃx ‘like’, as a means of clause combining,
and as a comparative marker on adjectives.
   Further non-word class-changing derivations include reduplication of nouns. Full reduplica-
tion of nouns has distributive meaning (also see §4.3, and Table 4.2), as in ña-ñ@ (day+lk-day)
‘every day, day in day out’, bap-a-bap (moon-lk-moon) ‘month after month’, t@p-a-t@p ‘every
village’, gwalugw@ gwalugw@ ma:j (clan+lk clan+lk story) ‘story which goes from one clan to
another’, tamiy-a-tamiy (area-lk-area) ‘every area, every place’, wi(y)-a-wi (house-lk-house)
192      9 Derivation and Compounding‘every house’, and n@b-a-n@b ‘various strangers’. Such nouns can be used in any function, and
take case markers.
   The reduplicated form of ga:n ‘night’ is irregular: ganap-ganap ‘every night’. The time noun
ganbab ‘early in the morning’ undergoes repetition rather than reduplication, in order to
acquire a distributive meaning, as in ganbab ganbab ‘every early morning’. The noun gra:b
is repeated in the locative case form: grab@m grab@m ‘every afternoon’. Time nouns denoting
relative time (tomorrow, yesterday, etc.) cannot be reduplicated.
   The noun s@ ‘name’ has an irregular reduplication pattern: say-si ‘(call) each (person or
house) by name’. This pattern is reminiscent of that discussed in §12.8 (also see §16.1, on k@tay-
k@ti ‘look around and around’). In both k@tay k@tí and say-si, reduplication involves repeating
all the syllables of the form after its main occurrence, with the vowel of the last syllable lost
and y changed to i .
   If a noun has a unique referent, it acquires an intensive meaning when reduplicated, as does
ñ@d ‘middle’ in ñ@d-@-ñ@d ‘the very middle’ (see 9.27 and 7.34). As shown in §4.3.2, reduplicated
adjectives also have intensive meaning, e.g. kwam ‘crazy’, kwam-a-kwam ‘very crazy’; yara
‘ﬁne’, yara-yara ‘very good’.
   The reduplication of closed word classes produces intensive or distributive meaning, e.g.
adverbs m@ya-m@ya:b ‘really really; indeed’; s@ms@ma:b ‘well and truly (not) at all’ (s@ma:b
‘not at all’: see §14.6); k@p ‘just’, k@p-a-k@p-a ma:j (just-lk-just-lk talk) ‘words for nothing,
useless talk’. When the number ‘one’ is reduplicated, its meaning is idiosyncratic: nak-a-nak
(one-lk-one) ‘not many; each individually’ (also see §10.6.1; cf. Iatmul kita ‘that one’, kita kita
‘one each; each per unit’: Gerd Jendraschek, p.c.). The indeﬁnite determiner ka:p ‘on its own;
alone’ can be reduplicated in the intensive meaning ‘all alone’ (kap@-ka:p).
   Inherently reduplicated roots are found in every word class except for verbs, e.g. ñauñau (t@)
‘smash’, l@kil@ki ‘soft’, n@mn@m ‘tired’, m@km@k, karkar ‘quietly’ (noun-like complements);
adverbs r @ka:r@k ‘properly’, apar apar ‘not properly’, mad@k mad@k ‘especially, namely’, and
r @ka:r@k ‘properly’; and quantiﬁers samasa:m ‘a lot’, and aba:b ‘all’.
   Among one-oﬀ derivational formatives is the formative -b which derives the lexeme gan@b
‘morning’ from ga:n ‘night’, and -ab which derives the time noun ganba:b ‘early in the morning’
from gan@b ‘morning’. (This noun undergoes repetition rather than reduplication, to acquire a
distributive meaning, as in ganbab ganbab ‘every early morning’.) The formative -b may well be
cognate with the terminative case -Vb which is used as a derivational device on adverbs (§4.4).
                                    9.3 comp oundingManambu has a number of patterns of nominal compounding. Some noun phrases can be
realized as one or more than one phonological word depending on their syllable length. They
diﬀer from compounds in the number of grammatical words they form, and their semantic
compositionality. A compound always forms one grammatical word and tends to be seman-
tically non-compositional. We saw in §2.5, that a modiﬁer-head noun phrase or a possessive
noun phrase (types A and C in §8.1.1) consisting of two or three syllables is pronounced as one
phonological word. Examples are: kula-má:j (new-word) ‘new word’, kwasa-ñán ‘small child’,
yala-wí (belly+lk-house) ‘the inside of a house’, m@w-mí ‘base of a tree’, taba-yí (hand+lk-ﬁre)
‘wrist watch’. They can be pronounced as two phonological words in slow deliberate register.
Similar structures are pronounced as several phonological words if more than three syllables
long.
                                                                      9.3 Compounding         193  Possessive noun phrases and adjective-noun noun phrases which start their life as phono-
logical compounds become true morphological compounds once (i) their meaning becomes
non-compositional (that is, the meaning of the whole is no longer a simple combination of
the meanings of the parts), and (ii) they form one grammatical word. This is the case with
possessive NPs of type A: these include personal names, e.g. Ñ@d-@-wi (middle-lk-house)
‘middle of the house’, and of type C, e.g. ab-a-wapwi (head-lk-dress) ‘hat’ and ap-a-t@p (bone-
lk-village) ‘Avatip’. These are discussed under types (1) and (2) below.
  In terms of morphological relationship between components and their word class, com-
pounds are of the following types:
1. ‘Genitive’ compounds consist of two nouns, one in a genitive, possessive, or associative
relationship to the other. Structurally, these correspond to possessive constructions of types A
and C in §8.1.1. The meaning is non-compositional to a varying extent. Examples include m@w-
t@p (base-village) ‘main village; an alternative name for Avatip’, ap-a-na:gw (bone/remainder-
lk sago) ‘sago ﬁbre left over from washing sago; sago pith’; nagw@-gar (sago+lk-ﬁeld) ‘ﬁeld
or grove of sago; where sago palms are’; t@p-a-kudi (village-lk-language) ‘village language,
Manambu’, n@b-@-du (dry.land-lk-man) ‘people of the jungle, strangers (a general term for
those who do not traditionally live on the Sepik River and are thus potential enemies: see
Harrison 1993 for a discussion of this notion)’. Place names are often compounds of this kind,
e.g. Yawa-bak (tree.species+lk-ﬁeld) ‘ﬁeld of tree.species’.
   Ad hoc expressions, like n@b@l-a-ga:n (today-lk-night) ‘tonight, the night of today’, nagw@-
ya:b (sago+lk-road) ‘road to sago or with sago’, or m@gw@-ñan (whatever+lk-child) ‘child to
do with whatever we were talking about previously’, straddle the boundary between NPs and
compounds and are inherently ambiguous, given the immense productivity of N-N structures
described in §8.1.1.
   Fixed collocations can be problematic as to whether they are compounds or noun phrases.
Examples like t@p-a-ja:p (village-lk-thing) ‘village thing, to refer to sorcery’; gu-jab@r (water-
ship) ‘water-raft’; t@n@b-@-baw (ﬁreplace-lk-ash) ‘ashes from a ﬁreplace’; and yar@g-a-du
(household-lk-man) ‘man of (the same) household’ can each be described as referring to a
unitary culturally signiﬁcant concept, and hence better treated as compounds. The latter two
instances are more than three syllables long and are often pronounced either with a secondary
stress, or as two phonological words.
   A particular N-N combination can be fully semantically transparent and be on the way
towards developing into a term. For instance, t@k-@-mi (seed-lk-tree) ‘fruit or seed of a tree’ is
the preferred way of referring to any kind of pill. Similarly, t@p-a-s@ (village-lk-name) ‘village
name’ is a term for traditional name, and wali-s@ (white.person-name) means ‘Christian or
given name’ (referring to name given at baptism and diﬀerent from the traditional, or ‘village’,
name and not just ‘name of/for a white person’).
   A component of a compound can develop a special meaning limited to just this context:
ap-a- (bone-lk) has the meaning of ‘main, true’, as in the name of apa-t@p, that is, Avatip, the
main village; and other expressions, such as ap-a-nagudaw (bone-lk-Nagudaw) ‘a true member
of Nagudaw clan’.
2. Adjective-noun compounds are fairly productive, e.g. kula-t@p (new-village) ‘new village;
term referring to the new location of Avatip and the villages which are relatively recent
compared to Avatip’; r@k-a-s@p (dry-lk-skin) ‘dry skin; a person with dry skin; term referring
to any old person’. Just as with type 1 compounds, some are ambiguous with noun phrases,
e.g. kula-kamna:gw (new/fresh-food) ‘fresh food’ as opposed to dry food.
194     9 Derivation and Compounding   Adjective-noun compounds often contain m@ya- ‘real’ whose exact meaning depends on the
second component of a compound: m@y-a-m@y-a-kayik (real-lk-real-lk-image/ghost) means
‘carving; picture (or any man-made image of a human or animal)’; m@y-a-na:gw (real-lk-
sago) refers to cultivated sago; m@y-a-kamna:gw (real-lk-food) refers to protein foods and
also traditional foods considered ‘strong’, such as sago (see §21.2.4).
   The noun wali used as a modiﬁer frequently occurs in compounds to refer to white peo-
ple’s imports, e.g. wali-kamna:gw (white.person-food) ‘non-traditional food stuﬀ’, wali-yaki
(white.person-smoke) ‘store-bought tobacco’, wali-na:gw (white.person-sago) ‘biscuit’, wali-s@
‘Christian name’ (see above). This term is often extended to refer to any object acquired after
contact, e.g. wali-kami: (white.person-ﬁsh), to refer to a type of ﬁsh reportedly from Indonesian
waters which has been invading the waters of the Sepik for the last twenty-ﬁve years. Some of
these compounds develop very speciﬁc meanings, e.g. wali-kudi (white.person/east-language)
used to refer to any ‘white man’s language’, that is, both Tok Pisin and English, but now
mostly used to refer to Tok Pisin (Inglis kudi being the term for English). The compound
wali-n@b (white.person-dry.land) ‘dry-land-dweller of white person type; white person’ is a way
of referring to white people. (This has a morpheme-per-morpheme cognate in Iatmul (Gerd
Jendraschek, p.c.), and could have been calqued from Iatmul.)
   The status of a compound as type 1 or type 2 may be indeterminate if the ﬁrst component
can be used as either a noun or an adjective. This is the case with compounds containing wali
‘white person; something to do with white person; eastern (wind); something coming from the
east’, and a few others, e.g. kaykwap-a ta:b (lazy-lk hand) ‘left hand’, literally, ‘lazy-hand or
hand of a lazy one’.
3. Coordinate compounds consist of two nouns typically without the linker referring to a
new referent which can be deﬁned by the two conjoined referents as its major representa-
tives, e.g. du-ta:kw (man-woman) ‘people’, mæn-ta:b (leg-hand) ‘arms and legs’, amæy-asa:y
(mother-father) ‘parents’, væy-ka:d (spear-shield) ‘arms’. If the ﬁrst component contains a
long vowel, it gets shortened, e.g. awa:y ‘mother’s brother’, away-mamæy (lit ‘maternal.uncle-
mother.and.her.sisters’) ‘relatives responsible for bringing up a child’. The ﬁrst component of
some coordinate compounds can take the comitative marker, e.g. am-a-wa n@bi (bow-lk-com
arrow) (as in 7.71) or am-n@bi ‘bow and arrow’. Possibly, du-ta:kw (man-woman) ‘people’,
mæn-ta:b (leg-hand) ‘arms and legs’ were inﬂuenced by Tok Pisin man-meri ‘people’ and lek-
han ‘arms and legs’. (However, compounds of similar structure have been attested both in
related Ndu languages and in the neighbouring Kwoma and Yessan-Mayo.) The compound
kami-kamna:gw (ﬁsh-food) ‘foodstuﬀ’ has a generic noun as its second component.
4. Synonymous compounds are structurally and semantically similar to coordinate com-
pounds. They consist of two near-synonyms, or nouns from the same semantic ﬁeld, both
with non-human referents. The compound describes either a group of linked referents, or
one referent with pronounced features of both components. The linker is obligatory, e.g.
kamkaw-a-ñan (hairy.yam-lk-smooth.white.yam) ‘yams as a group’; ar-a-ñab (lake-lk-river)
‘lake’; apwi-m@d (cassowary.vocative.term-cassowary) ‘mature female cassowary’; d@g-a-ta:m
(beak-lk-nose) ‘nose’.
5. Generic-specific compounds are somewhat similar to constructions with noun classiﬁers
in Australian and in Mayan languages. They consist of a noun ‘woman’ or ‘man’ followed
by a speciﬁc noun. With hybrid nouns, they serve to disambiguate the sex of a referent (see
§5.3), as in takwa-ñan (woman+lk-child) ‘girl’, du-a-ñan (man-lk-child) ‘boy’, gwa:s ‘turtle’,
du-a gwa:s ‘male turtle’, takwa gwa:s ‘female turtle’. They can also combine with some speciﬁc
                                                                                      9.3 Compounding               195nouns whose referents are inanimate, or non-human; then they indicate species, as in du-a-mæj
(man-lk-thread) ‘strong natural ﬁbre for making stringbags’ and du-a-kabay (man-lk-snake)
‘type of dangerous snake’. The term du-a-ma:gw (man-lk-generic.noun) ‘brother’ also belongs
to this type. These are similar to gender-identifying compounds containing nouns ‘man’
and ‘woman’ as their second component, as in babay-du ‘maternal grandfather’, babay-ta:kw
‘maternal grandmother’, yanan-ta:kw ‘daughter’s daughter’, yanan-du ‘daughter’s son’, and
bap-a-ta:kw (moon-lk-woman) ‘lady moon’ (note that moon is always feminine: see §5.2.1).
6. Order and size compounds contain asa:y ‘father’ and amæy ‘mother’ as their ﬁrst compo-
nent. The term ‘father’ denotes large size, as in numa-d@ asa:y wuk (big-masc.sg father tooth)
‘very big tooth’, or asa:y wuk ‘huge tooth’, numa-d@ asa:y na:b ‘very long hair’ and so on (also
see §5.2.1 and 5.14). The term amæy refers to order in the compound amæy ta:kw (mother wife)
‘ﬁrst wife’, and perhaps also to prominence, as in amæy ta:b (mother hand) ‘thumb’. There is
no linker between the components.
7. Echo compounds involve nouns with non-human referents, and have the meaning of ‘things
of the same nature as the component which serves as base of echo alliteration’ (cf. Yip 1998:
237–8, for an outline of this phenomenon), e.g. ar-sar (lake-echo.reduplication) ‘lake and so
on; lake and waterways’; mij-ma:j (echo.reduplication-talk) ‘all kinds of small talk’. Echo
compounds of adverbs and one adjective have intensive meaning, e.g. kuprap ‘bad’, kuprap@-
saprap ‘really bad’, walba:b ‘near, close’, walba:b kalba:b ‘very close’ (or wal@b ‘close’, wal@b
kal@b ‘very close’), and sakw@r ‘happy’, makw@r sakw@r ‘very happy’, and so do noun-like
complements, such as wayg@r (with auxiliary) ‘complain’, wayg@r sayg@r ‘complain a lot’;
kayg@n ‘(be) silent’, kayg@n sayg@n ‘be really silent’. The only example of an inherently echo
compound is the noun-like complement saul@y paul@y ‘be in great numbers’, as in 9.37:
9.37 du-ta:kw      saul@y.paul@y      yi-di
     man-woman in.great.numbers go-3plbas.vt
     ‘People were in great numbers’. 18. Compounds involving closed word classes include a Postposition-Noun combination
kuk@-m@l (at.back-eye) ‘(look) sideways’, and a Numeral-Noun combination viti-kisa-ñ@di
(two-?-child:du) ‘twins’.
9. Verb-noun compounds consist of a verb root plus a noun. The structure of the compounds
is similar to that of relative clauses (see §§19.2.2–3): the noun can be S, O, oblique, or A (the
latter is not so frequent), r @-tami: (sit-area) ‘area where one lives; living area’, kiya-du (die-man)
‘dead man’, bra-t@p (scrape-coconut) ‘coconut for scraping’, bla-ma:j (speak-speech) ‘talk’. A
compound can consist of a subject of a weather verb + the weather verb’s root + noun root, as
in [wa:l ja]-s@k@r (rain fall-time) ‘time of rainfall’.
   This compounding type is extremely productive and is widely used to coin terms, such as
kusu-ja:p (wear-thing) ‘clothing’, gra-kudi (cry-language) ‘mourning, crying; term for mourn-
ing songs’, kiya-du ‘dead man; used as name of a Manambu football team in Avatip’. The term
s@kwa-mawul (carve-state.of.mind/inside) ‘state of mind of a carver’ was suggested by David
Takendu as a term meaning ‘patience’. The ﬁrst component of such compounds can consist of
  1 Echo compounds are attested in other Ndu languages; the examples given by Wendel (1993: 92) from Hanga
Kundi (Wosera), involve verbs, unlike Manambu where verbs do not follow this pattern. Similar examples are given by
Staalsen and Staalsen (1975) in their dictionary of Iatmul, e.g. walanga salanga ‘relatives’. Gerd Jendraschek discovered
further echo compounds, e.g. wapuk sapuk ‘stories’ (pronounced as wapuchapuk). The number of echo compounds in
Manambu is too restricted to warrant any meaningful generalizations.
196     9 Derivation and Compoundinga complex verb in its root form and a noun, as in s@-kwa-ja:p (sleep-hab-thing) ‘sleeping gear’,
s@-kwa-wi (sleep-hab-house) ‘house for sleeping’.
   In just one instance, the verb root in a Verb-Noun compound appears with a formative
unique to this compound: bla-ja-ya-ma:j (speak-?-come?-talk/story) ‘story; something to tell’
(see §15.3). This compound is not functionally equivalent to a relative clause.
A morphological type of a compound is hard to determine if part of it is not used anywhere else.
Examples include saw-na:gw (?-sago) ‘wild sago’, s@p-a-tabi (body-lk-?) ‘clothes; body cover’,
as@-kami: (?-ﬁsh) ‘catﬁsh’, and ñ@g-a-ñam (leaf-lk-?) ‘leafy vegetable’. Sometimes a part of a
compound is no longer used in Manambu itself, and comparison with related languages may
provide a clue. This is the case with gab-@-ma:j (?-lk-story) ‘traditional story; teacher’, often
pronounced as gama:j. The ﬁrst component is cognate to Iatmul gabu- ‘talk, discuss’ (Staalsen
n.d.b; Jendraschek, p.c.); that is, originally this form must have been a type 9 compound.
Along similar lines, the term gai-na:gw (?-sago) ‘sago starch’ probably contains the element gai
cognate to the term for ‘house, household’ throughout the Ndu family. Terms gai-du (Gai-man)
and gai-ta:kw (Gai-woman) are used to refer to the Wosera, and especially the Abelam in whose
language gai is a term for ‘house, village’.
   The modiﬁer nawi ‘mate, one of the same kind, peer group’, as in nawi-du (mate-man) ‘man
of the same age; mate’ and nawi-ta:kw ‘woman of the same age, peer group’, never occurs on
its own; as a result, the structural type of compound is diﬃcult to determine. Unlike other
components of compounds, nawi can be reduplicated without reduplicating the noun. The
reduplication imparts collective meaning, as in nawi-nawi-du ‘all male peer group’, nawi-nawi-
ta:kw ‘all female peer group’. In combination with ‘child’, the reduplicated form nawi-nawi
requires the plural ñanugw ‘children’, as in nawi-nawi-ñanugw ‘all children peer group’. The
agreement on the verb is also plural:
9.38 [nawi-nawi-ta:kw] ata aban taka-di
     peer-peer-woman then pact put.down-3plbas.vt
     ‘All peer group women then conspired together’
  Compounds can have a complex internal structure. Attested combinations involve type 2
and type 9, e.g. gla-[kusu-wapwi] (black+lk-wear-clothes) ‘black clothes’ (for instance, as a
type of clothing worn under mourning); type 2 and type 5, as in [ñiki-s@p-]a-du (red-skin-lk-
man) ‘white man’; or type 2 and type 3, e.g. n@b-@-[du-ta:kw] (inland-lk-man-woman) ‘people
who live inland’ (a term used to refer to those who do not traditionally live on the Sepik River:
§1.4.1).
        10        Closed Classes
Closed word classes are personal pronouns (§10.1), demonstratives (§10.2), indeﬁnites (§10.3),
interrogatives (§10.4), quantiﬁers (§10.5), and numerals (§10.6). Most of them share some prop-
erties with nouns but do not take the full range of noun morphology discussed in Chapters 4–9.
This justiﬁes their recognition as separate classes. An overview of their morphological and
syntactic features is in §10.7.                               10.1 p e r s o na l p ro n o u n sPersonal pronouns are given in Table 3.3 (repeated here). They distinguish three numbers—
singular, dual, and plural—and two genders in second and in third person singular. There is a
clear etymological connection between independent pronouns, the two sets of tense-sensitive
verbal cross-referencing markers, and cross-referencing enclitics employed with non-verbal
predicates (listed in Tables 3.1–2 and 3.4). Grammaticalization of personal pronouns as cross-
referencing markers appears to be relatively recent.
   Personal pronouns share most properties with nouns. Just like nouns, they take the approx-
imative suﬃx -p@k in the meaning ‘like’, e.g. wun-a-p@k (I-lk-approx) ‘more or less like me’.
A pronoun can occur in apposition with a noun or a noun phrase, e.g. wun ñ@n-a ñam@s (I
you.fem-lk+fem.sg younger.sibling) ‘me, your younger sister’. However, it cannot be modiﬁed
by adjectives or relative clauses, or head a possessive NP (see type D2 in §8.1.1, for possessive
constructions employed with a pronominal possessor).
   All non-singular personal pronouns participate in argument elaboration (‘inclusory’) con-
structions (see §6.2.3; examples 6.32–3) as cover terms. A direct object expressed with a
personal pronoun tends to be case marked, unless the grammatical relations are fully clear
from the context (as in 7.5, in §7.2).
   Non-third person pronouns stand apart from third person pronouns in the following ways:
(i) First and second person pronouns always have an animate (preferably human) referent, as
a speech act participant. Third person pronouns may refer to any entity.
(ii) Third person non-plural pronouns take the oblique marker -k@- (see §4.1.1; this form is
homophonous with the possessive marker -k@- discussed in §8.2) to form cases expressed with
a non-ø suﬃx, e.g. d@-k@-k (he-obl-dat) ‘to him’, d@-k@-wa (he-obl-com) ‘with him’, and to
combine with each of four suﬃxes discussed in §9.2. The linker is also obligatory if a pronoun
is used as an argument of a postposition (see §4.5), e.g. d@-k@ kuk@r (he-obl after) ‘after him’.
(iii) Third person pronouns take all case markers, while ﬁrst and second person pronouns do
not occur with transportative cases.
(iv) First and second person pronouns occur in identiﬁcation constructions (see §8.2.2) whereby
the notional possessor is the subject of a verbless clause, and the possessed noun occupies the
predicate slot. Such constructions with personal pronouns imply full ownership and complete

names belonging to their clan, and then summarize his speech by saying 8.24 or 10.1:
10.1 ñan-adiyan
     we-1plnom
     ‘These are ours’ (lit. ‘(these) are us’)
(v) Only third person pronouns are used as pronominal possessive markers in possessive noun
phrases of type D2, used if possessor is a noun with a speciﬁc referent (§8.1.1).
(vi) Only a third person pronoun can be used as a modiﬁer in noun phrases which contain a
functionally unmarked distal demonstrative. The agreement in gender and number with the
head noun is obligatory. The meaning of these combinations is akin to that of a deﬁnite article
with emphatic overtones, ‘that very one’ (see §20.1.1 on NP structure). This is a way of referring
to a previously mentioned important participant. Example 10.2 comes from a story about a
man who encountered a woman in the jungle.10.2 [la                  ta:kw] vyak@t-a ta:kw ma:, kuprap-@ ta:kw-al
     she+dem.dist.fem.sg woman good-lk woman neg bad-lk woman-3fem.sgnom
     ‘That previously mentioned woman is not a good woman, she is a bad woman (she is an
     evil spirit)’
Three clauses later, the woman is mentioned again; she is an important participant—the one
who is going to bring misfortune to the man. A noun phrase which contains a personal
pronoun in an article-like function, a distal demonstrative, and an indeﬁnite pronoun is in
10.3:
10.3 [d@ a-d@               n@k@-d@       du] ata ya:d                 kwarba:r
     he dem.dist-masc.sg other-masc.sg man then go+3masc.sgbas bush+lk+all
     ‘That very one (previously mentioned important participant) other man then went to the
     bush’
  Such sequences of a personal pronoun and a demonstrative do not belong to two separate
NPs, because there is no pause between them, and the two are often pronounced as one
phonological word.
  These six features point towards the existence of subtle grammatical distinctions between
ﬁrst and second person pronouns (that is, speech act participants) and third person pronouns
(non-speech act participants). We return to this distinction in §19.5.4, on speech report tech-
niques.
                                                                 10.1 Personal Pronouns        199A fully reduplicated pronoun has an emphatic meaning roughly translatable as ‘oneself’, e.g.
ñ@n-a-ñ@n ‘you (feminine) yourself, really you, as for you’, wun-a-wun ‘I myself; really me, as for
me’. A fully reduplicated singular third person pronoun requires the oblique marker -k@-, as in
d@-k@-d@-k@ (he-obl-he-obl) ‘he himself’. As is typical for VkV syllables (process A3 in §2.6),
the middle syllable -k@- is elided in normal to fast speech, and one frequently hears d@-d@-k@
‘he himself’ (as in 10.10, 10.11, and 10.15). Interestingly, the oblique -k@- does not occur on
third person dual pronouns (10.4)—we can recall that the linker -k@- is obligatorily used with
any non-plural non-reduplicated third person pronoun.
   This emphatic meaning of full reduplication is a speciﬁc feature of pronouns as a word
class. An emphatic pronoun can occur in any function in a clause. In 10.4, it is used to mark
possessor, and in 10.5 it marks addressee.
10.4 b@r-br@-k@            ñan kayt@k wuna:k       kur-kwa-na-b@r
     3du-3du-obl+fem.sg child like        I+lk+dat do-hab-act.foc-3dubas.vt
     ‘They used to treat me like their own child’
10.5 wun-a-wuna:k ak@s         wa-kwa-na-d
     I-lk-I+lk+dat neg.hab speak/tell-hab-act.foc-3masc.sgbas.vt
     ‘He never talks to me myself’
In 10.15, it marks the A and the O. The two meanings of an emphatic reduplicated personal
pronoun—that of emphasis and that of ownership—may not be distinguishable, as in 10.6:
10.6 d@-k@-d@-ka                      ta:kw ma:
     he-lk-he-lk+dem.dist+fem.sg wife neg
     ‘He himself had no wife’ (lit. ‘His own wife did not (exist)’, or ‘As for him, there was no
     wife’)
  When a reduplicated pronoun appears in the predicate slot, it does not take any personal
cross-referencing. As shown in 10.7, it can take the conﬁrmation marker -@k:
10.7 wun-a-wun-@k k@ka                          r@-tua
     I-lk-I-conf      dem.prox.react.top.fem.sg sit-1sgsubj.p+3fem.sgbas.vt
     ‘It is me myself, I am here sitting’
Reduplicated personal pronouns translate into Tok Pisin with a particle yet (as in em yet ‘he
himself’, yu yet ‘you yourself’). Speakers who frequently code-switch into Tok Pisin employ
the particle yet (underlined), as in 10.8. This was corrected as 10.9, by another speaker:
10.8 ñ@n yet væn        r@-ñ@n-@k
     you yet see+seq sit-2fem.sgbas.vt-conf
     ‘You yourself are sitting looking’
10.9 ñ@n-a-ñ                væn      r@-ñ@n-@k
     you.fem-lk-you.fem see+seq sit-2fem.sgbas.vt-conf
     ‘You yourself are sitting looking’
  Some speakers from Malu village employ both a reduplicated personal pronoun and the Tok
Pisin particle yet:
10.10 d@d@-k@            yet m@y-a-m@y-a ap-a-nagudaw-ad
      he(+lk)+he-obl yet real-lk-real-lk bone-lk-nagudaw-3masc.sgnom
      ‘He himself is a very true member of real Nagudaw clan’
200     10 Closed ClassesThis phenomenon whereby native and borrowed grammatical forms appear together is known
as lexical/grammatical parallelism (see Hajek 2006 for Tetun Dili; Aikhenvald forthcoming c).
This is how foreign forms make their way into the language, in a situation which appears to
disfavour a downright replacement of native forms with foreign insertions.
  The semantic analogy between the reduplicated personal pronouns must have contributed to
an extension of reduplicated pronouns to mark reﬂexive, as in 10.11 which describes a suicide.
Such examples are rare.
10.11 d@d@-k@          vya-s@pa-ku         ada
      he(+lk)+he-obl hit-hit.body-compl.ss dem.dist.react.top.masc.sg
      kiya:d
      die+3masc.sgbas.p
      ‘Having hit himself, he died’
  An alternative to emphatic personal pronouns as markers of co-referential possession is the
adverb ka:p ‘own’, as in kapa kagr@s (own+lknephew) ‘one’s own nephew’. Further ways of
expressing reﬂexive meanings are discussed in §16.2.4.                                  10.2 de m o n s t rat i v e sManambu has three demonstrative roots, k@- ‘proximate demonstrative: near speaker’, wa-
‘proximate demonstrative: near addressee’, and a- ‘distal demonstrative (far from both)’. These
roots occur in nominal demonstratives also used as spatio-temporal demonstratives (§10.2.1),
in manner adverbial demonstratives (§10.2.2), and in reactivated topic demonstratives (§10.2.3).
Of all demonstratives, only nominal demonstratives distinguish additional distance (as shown
in Table 10.1 below) and directions.","[211, 212, 213, 214, 215, 216, 217, 218, 219, 220, 221, 222, 223, 224, 225, 226, 227]"
"Manambu has nine case forms (including zero). Each has a number of meanings and functions,
and is in opposition to others. There are two ways of interpreting this system. We can distin-
guish nine cases each corresponding to one form (this can be called a ‘lumper’ approach).
Or we can distinguish eighteen cases, going strictly by their function (this can be called a
‘splitter’ approach). Table 7.2 contrasts a ‘lumper’ and a ‘splitter’ approach, with a summary
justiﬁcation for either.
   The coordinating comitative on NP level is used to link constituents of an NP and does not
mark any grammatical relations; this is why it is not treated on a par with other cases here.
The terminative, two transportative and substitutive cases are semantically and functionally
straightforward, and constitute one case each. (As shown in Table 3.5, a form marked with
these cases, except for terminative, cannot be cross-referenced on the verb.)
   A ‘lumper’ approach has two advantages—it is economical and allows us to capture a
notable semantic and syntactic connection between diﬀerent case meanings and uses, which
include
    (i) ø marking for copula complements and for the second argument of verbs ‘turn into’
        (which may be viewed as a variety of copula verbs of ‘becoming’);
   (ii) the -Vm ‘accusative-locative case’ which has a shared meaning of complete involvement
        of the O argument, the locative, or another argument completely aﬀected by the action;
  (iii) the -Vk ‘dative-aversive’ case where the common syntactic core is marking arguments
        which are not prototypical or not completely aﬀected objects; and
  (iv) the -wa ‘comitative case’ which has a variety of meanings all of which can be captured
        under the umbrella notion of ‘accompaniment’.
  A ‘splitter’ approach allows us to separate diﬀerent meanings and functions of the same
form. It is appropriate when two or more meanings of a form have little in common semanti-
cally or syntactically or both.
  Putting together the advantages of both approaches, we judge it most reasonable and
economical to postulate the following system of thirteen cases:
  ø-case for subjects;
  ø-case for copula complements;
  ø-case for objects;
  ø-case for manner;
  -Vm ‘complete involvement of an argument (most often locatives and O arguments)’;
  -Vk ‘dative case for third arguments and not fully aﬀected second arguments; aversive and
    purposive’;
  -Vr ‘allative case’;
  -Vr ‘instrumental case’;
  -wa ‘comitative case’;

                          7.11 c a s e m o r ph o lo gy o n v e r b sNominal case suﬃxes (with the exception of the terminative, transportative, and comitative
cases) can occur on verbal roots. None of the zero-case morphology applies to verbs: a verb
root cannot occur on its own. The resulting forms diﬀer in their status. In addition, all case
morphology can occur on headless relative clauses (see §19.2.1). Relative clauses in Manambu
have all the tense-aspect and person marking of the main clause (they diﬀer from main clauses
in how they are negated). An example of a headless relative clause marked with a comitative
is kui-kwa-na-di-a-wa (give.to.third.p-hab-act.foc-3plbas.vt-lk-com) ‘with those who usually
give’. These look like instances of case marking on what is homonymous with an inﬂected main
clause verb.
   The marker -Vm ‘complete involvement of a second participant’ is reminiscent of -Vm
‘accusative-locative’ whose meaning involves completeness of involvement of an argument, or
an oblique. The marker -Vm occurs on verbal and other roots (see §12.6) indicating completion
of an action, or total achievement of a state, as in kuprap-@-m (bad-lk-loc) ‘it is totally bad’,
7.34, and in 7.85:
7.85 d@-k@-d@         ñan wuk@mar-@-m
     he-lk-masc.sg child forget-lk-loc
     ‘(I) completely forgot his son’
   A completive form of r@p ‘be enough’, r@p-@-m ‘fully enough’, is often used in the meaning
of ‘this is perfect; this is ﬁne’. The completive form can only be used as a copula complement
of na- ‘copula for abstract states’ (see §12.6).
   Dative -Vk case on a verbal root has same subject purposive meaning (see §13.4.1 and
§19.4.1), as in 7.76 where such forms are used as purpose complements to verbs of motion.
   This same form is used in a construction with the auxiliary kur- ‘do’ in its imminent meaning,
e.g. kiya-k kur- (die-purp.ss get/do) ‘be about to die’ (§17.1.2).
   The instrumental -Vr appears on a few verbal roots, in a function of manner adverb, as in
væs-@-r mæy (walk-lk-instr come.impv) ‘come by stepping’ (see Aikhenvald forthcoming g,
for further discussion). It also occurs in one lexicalized V-V compound nas-@-k@ta:-r (count-
lk-try-instr) ‘by counting (when talking about the number of people or days)’.
   The substitutive case -yæy on a verb can serve as a sequencing marker with the meaning
‘instead of, rather than’ (§19.3, and examples 19.36–7 and T3.40).
   Using cases on verbal roots does not nominalize them. The resulting forms are less pro-
totypically verbal: -Vm and -Vk- marked verbs belong to the group of uninﬂected aspectual
modal forms, and the combination of verb root plus -Vr case can be considered similar to a
manner adverb. The verb forms marked with the substitutive -yæy can be same subject (with
no special subject marking) or diﬀerent subject (and then the subject is marked on them:
see §18.1 for the discussion of this as a general principle in Manambu). The phenomenon
of verbal case as exponent of clausal meanings, and as clause-linking device, is widespread in
Australian languages (Dixon 2002a: 237–8) and in a number of languages from other parts of
the world. The discussion of Manambu verbal case in typological perspective is in Aikhenvald
(forthcoming d).
         8         Possession
Manambu distinguishes ﬁve major kinds of possessive noun phrases whose choice depends
mainly on the semantics of a noun and that of the possessive relationship—see §8.1. Predicative
possession and the ways of cross-referencing the possessor on the verb are discussed in §8.2.
     8.1 p o s s e s s i v e n o u n phra s e s, t h e i r f u n c t i o n s a n d s e m a n t i c s                                 8.1.1 Possessive noun phrasesManambu has ﬁve types of possessive noun phrases: (A) part–whole NPs; (B) NPs with
juxtaposed components; (C) NPs with a linker; (D) NPs with pronominal possessive marker;
and (E) associative possessive NPs.
  Table 8.1 contrasts these in terms of (i) semantic relationship between nouns; (ii) restrictions
on type of possessee; (iii) restrictions on possessor; (iv) focusing of possessor, possessee, or
the possessive relationship; (v) whether the possessor or the possessee can consist of a noun
plus a modiﬁer; (vi) whether the head can be omitted; (vii) whether multiple possessors are
possible; and (viii) whether a possessive NP can be discontinuous. What all the constructions
have in common is that the possessed noun is invariably the head. We will see in §8.1.2 that
most nouns can occur in any of the ﬁve constructions, with meaning diﬀerences (Table 8.2).
Manambu has no strictly deﬁned possession classes for nouns, with one exception. No nouns
other than body and plant parts can occur in part–whole NPs (type A); body and plant parts
can occur in constructions B–E.
A. Part–whole NPs consist of a body or plant part, or of a spatial term, plus the linker
followed by the ‘whole’, or the ‘possessor’. The possessor is generally inanimate, and the ﬁrst
component constitutes its inherent part, e.g. yala wi (belly+lk house) ‘the inside (lit. belly) of a
house’, baga wi (back+lk house) ‘back part of the house, backyard’; tama val (nose+lk canoe)
‘prow, front part or nose of a canoe’; ñ@d-@ ñab (middle-lk Sepik.river) ‘middle of the Sepik
River’; t@k-@ mi (seed-lk tree) ‘fruit of a tree; medicine’; s@p-a lap (skin-lk banana) ‘banana
skin’, kui-a lap (ﬂesh-lk banana) ‘ﬂesh of banana’; ab-a m@ñ (head-lk breast) ‘nipple; upper
part of the breast’.
   The same construction is used to express spatial relations and orientation, e.g. mut@m-a
kara:b (face-lk man’s.house) ‘(at) the front of the man’s house’; api ñ@g (top mosquito.net) ‘(on)
top of the mosquito net’; mada ñ@g (bottom/testicles+lk mosquito.net) ‘underneath mosquito
net’.
   The noun m@w ‘reason of, base of’ forms a similar construction with another noun, e.g.
m@w mi: ‘base of a tree’, m@w ñab ‘main part of the river’, m@w t@p ‘main part of the place;
main place’. These constructions can be pronounced as one phonological word (with one
stress on the last component) if they do not exceed three syllables (see §2.5.1 on the preferred
phonological word). Some are used as personal names, e.g. female names Ñ@d-@-wi (middle-
lk-house) ‘middle of the house’ and Jib-@-da:m (design-lk-spider) ‘spider’s design’.

                         10.2.3 ‘Reactivated topic’ demonstrativesThe three demonstrative stems—k@- ‘proximal (to the speaker)’, w@- ‘proximal to the
addressee’, and a- ‘distal’—mark reactivated topic, within the following structures:
  Demonstrative stem-gender/number agreement marker -@ka (pronounced in normal to rapid
register as a, in agreement with A3 under §2.6, see §3.3), e.g. k@-d-@ka, normal to rapid speech
k@-d-a (dem.prox-masc.sg-react.top) ‘this one masculine’; k@ka, underlying form k@-Ø-@ka
(dem.prox-fem.sg-react.top) ‘this one feminine’.
  Reactivated topic demonstratives, and the ways in which they operate, were introduced in
§3.3. Their major function is to reintroduce or re-establish a previously established topic,
especially if it has not been mentioned for some time. (Additional examples are under 3.16–18.)
They typically refer to S/O argument, and always agree in gender and number with the S/O
argument, and constitute the major instance of an absolutive pattern in the language. As
mentioned in §3.3, reactivated topic demonstratives provide a strong criterion for S—see, for
instance, the discussion of copula subject in §4.2.2.
  The choice of the demonstrative stem depends on the distance of the referent. In 10.61, the
narrator, John Sepaywus, is telling about the origin of the people of cassowary’s feathers; he
then reminds the audience of the fact that these people are in fact the Kwoma (in S function).
He then goes on talking about the Kwoma and their totemic links with cassowaries.
10.61 Kum    adika                   kwa-na-di
      Kwoma dem.dist.react.top+pl stay-act.foc-3plbas.vt
      ‘The Kwoma are the ones who stay there’
   A similar example is under 10.11 (where the S of the verb ‘die’ is referred to with a reactivated
topic pronoun).
   If a verb is strictly transitive, its A can never be referred to with a reactivated topic demon-
strative. If a verb is ambitransitive and is used intransitively (with only one, the S, cross-
referencing position ﬁlled), the S can be referred to with the reactivated topic demonstrative,
as in 10.62. The rooster is reintroduced as a topic (his appearance is important for this stretch
of the text because his singing implies that the night is over):
10.62 tapwuk ada                            ma: p@kaka:u
      rooster dem.dist.react.top+masc.sg again ‘cockadoodledoo’

      dem.dist.react.top+masc.sg say-act.foc-3masc.sgbas.vt
      ‘The rooster then (said) “cock-a-doodle-doo” again, he said again’
   We can recall, from §3.3, that if an O constituent is a reactivated topic, it is obligatorily cross-
referenced on the verb (using the basic set in the second cross-referencing position), as in 10.63
(an oﬀer to tell yet another story), and in 10.64 (the reactivated topic is a personal pronoun: the
speaker stresses that what she is talking about is herself and how she got taken into a strange
place) (a similar example, with wuka, is under 10.15).

      ‘Another man, a jungle-dweller (lit. dry-land man), has just brought me (future topic)
      (here)’
  If the verb ‘say’ is used transitively, the addressee can be referred to with the reactivated topic
demonstrative, if appropriate. In 10.65, the underlined form refers to the participants close to
the speaker who were to ﬁght the enemy from then on throughout the narrative:
10.65 k@diya                  wa-tua-di
      dem.prox.react.top+pl say-1sgsubj.vt-3plbas.vt
      ‘I told these (people)’
   The content of a direct speech report is never referred to with a reactivated topic demon-
strative (or cross-referenced). An NP object of the verb ‘say’ can be referred to this way (see
10.69).
   We saw in 3.18 that a reactivated topic marker refers to the recipient rather than the gift of
the ditransitive verbs ‘give’ if it is more animate than the gift. This is, however, not a steadfast
rule. After he had announced that he would tell us the names of men’s houses in the Avatip
village in its previous location (see 10.68), John Sepaywus added 10.66. The names are the
topic of the whole paragraph; they are referred to with the reactivated topic demonstrative and
cross-referenced on the verb ‘give’:
10.66 d@y-a-di s@         adiya                    kui-k@-tua-di
      they-lk-pl name dem.dist.react.top+pl give.to.third.p-fut-1sgsubj.vt-3plbas.vt
      ‘I will give (everyone) their (topical) names’ <names follow>
  If the gift is more topical in a given paragraph than the recipient, it can be referred to with
the reactivated topic demonstrative. In 10.67, ‘banana’ is re-established as a topic: this is what
the ﬂying fox used to give to her adopted son (whose topicality has already been established),
and it is the banana she gave him again. The second occurrence of ‘give’ cross-references the
recipient, as a means of further clariﬁcation.

      give.to.third.p-3fem.sgsubj.vt-3masc.sgbas.vt
      ‘She gave (him) the (topical) banana (then), she gave him (it)’
   A location can also be referred to with a reactivated topic demonstrative. In 10.68, John
Sepaywus once again enumerates the names of men’s houses in the Avatip village in its previous
location. This is something we had been talking about on and oﬀ during that morning, and the
reactivated topic demonstrative is used to ‘bring them back’ as important topics. The other
‘reactivated topic’ is the old ‘inland’ village itself—that is, a location.

      ‘Those men’s houses, those men’s houses which stay in that (topical) inland village, I will
      enumerate them (topical) again’   In 10.54, a cross-referenced constituent referred to with a reactivated topic demonstrative is
someone with respect to whom the action is performed. Examples of this sort indicate that the
reactivated topic demonstratives operate predominantly, but not exclusively, on an S/O basis.
Alternatively, they can be described as operating on a non-A basis. As illustrated in 10.68, a
clause can contain two occurrences of reactivated topic demonstratives, but never more than
that.
   The reactivated topic demonstratives do not appear to form one NP with the noun they refer
to. They agree with this noun in gender and number, but can never take any cases or suﬃxes
or be arguments of postpositions. There can be an intonation break between a demonstrative
and an NP it refers to (as in 10.68)—something atypical for an NP. Within a clause, they tend
to occur immediately preceding the verb (or the complex adverb+verb, as in 10.68). If the
constituent they refer to has a contrastive overtone, they follow it, as in 10.62. We will see,
in §20.1.1, that Manambu is not averse to split NPs; however, they are never split between
clauses.
   In terms of spatial reference, the demonstrative stems employed in reactivated topic demon-
stratives have similar overtones to the nominal spatio-temporal demonstratives (§10.2.1, under
A). In 10.69, the ‘close to addressee’ demonstrative is used to refer to the names of men’s houses
which were enumerated for my (addressee’s) beneﬁt (just as in 10.25 above).10.69 a-d@-wula                   t@p-a-k@-di          wudiya                  b@

      ‘I have already told the ones (names) of the away-from-the-Sepik River village, the

to the O (‘story’) and to the action of telling itself: it supplies an aspectual overtone of ‘here
and now; ongoing action’ to a verb marked with action focus. Similar examples are under 10.56
and 10.78. We return to this in §12.1 and in §12.8.3 (C).
    When reactivated topic demonstratives appear as predicate heads, they take the predica-
tive marker -n followed by -a- and by gender-number agreement marker -@ka, e.g. k@ka-n-
aka (dem.prox.react.top.fem.sg-pred-react.top.fem.sg) ‘this feminine singular (reactivated
topic) is’, often used as a summary statement, ‘this is how it is, this is how things are’. Its
distal demonstrative counterpart is often used in a similar way, meaning ‘so, this is how
it is’:

      ﬁghting)’  In 10.71 (the end of Sepaywus’s recital of the names of men’s houses in Avatip), a plural
reactivated topic demonstrative heads the predicate. The gender and number agreement with
the subject is thus marked twice.10.71 [a-di       [a-d@-wula                  t@pa]-k@-di kara:b]

      ‘The men’s houses belonging to that village inland are those ones (topical)’   To conclude: reactivated topic demonstratives agree with a cross-linguistic tendency for
preferred argument structure whereby a topical element is never introduced in the A func-
tion. They are typologically quite unusual in that they combine reference to the constituent’s
topicality, its grammatical relation, and its position in space. The latter makes them somewhat
redundant, given that they often occur in the same clause as nominal demonstratives with the
same spatial reference.
                                     10.3 i ndefinitesManambu has two indeﬁnites, with the meaning ‘other, another’. The agreeing modiﬁer fem.sg.
n@k@, masc.sg. n@k@-d@, dual n@k@-b@r , plural n@k@-di ‘another, other’ (see §5.1.1) refers to
another, additional and diﬀerent, participant, e.g. n@k@ ñ@ (another+fem.sg day) ‘next day,
another day’ and in 10.53 (’another story’). It can refer to ‘one’ and ‘another’ (members of a
pair), as in 10.55, or to several choices, as in 10.52. This example contains six occurrences of
n@k@ corresponding to the number of smoking grids in the spirit’s house. This pronoun can
also refer to an indeterminate location or time, or referent: n@k@ ñ@ (another+fem.sg day) can
mean ‘next day, another day’ (then its synonym is kwap@k ‘next day’). Or it can mean ‘some
other day, whenever’. This same pronoun may refer to additional objects, e.g. ‘two more plates’
as in 10.72.10.72 n@k@-b@r plet viti akray!
      other-du plate two impv+bring
      ‘Bring two more plates!’ (lit. two other plates)  The pronoun ‘other, another’ carries with it a distinct overtone of something undesirable
and potentially dangerous. In 10.3 above, ‘another man’, or a ‘stranger’ is a trespasser. A
similar example is 8.12 (the gist of it is that other people’s cats are strangers and do nothing
but damage).
  The feminine locative form of the indefinite n@k@- ‘other, another’, n@k@m, means ‘half-
heartedly; not fully’:
                                                                         10.3 Indeﬁnites       22310.73 gura:m                 [v@-tua                           m@l] n@k@-m

      v@-tua-digur-@k
      see-1sgsubj.vt-2plbas.vt-conf
      ‘I see you (with) the eye that sees (you) not very well’
This form can be repeated as n@k@m n@k@m (another.fem.sg+loc another.fem.sg+loc) ‘bit of
everything; in a random way’. In 10.74 it is used as modiﬁer to the noun, and in 10.75 as a
manner modiﬁer to the verb. In 21.44, repetition of n@k@m means ‘wherever’.
10.74 a-di        kamkaw ñan, n@k@m         n@k@m       k@k@pa:t a-b@r        b@

      ‘They two kept pottering around (do this and that in a random way)’
  The pronoun n@k@- is usually employed as a prehead modiﬁer; only occasionally can its
head be omitted. In contrast, the indeﬁnite n@w@k ‘(an)other one’ is used only as a head. It can
be modiﬁed with nominal demonstratives, but, unlike any other nominal, does not take case
marking. It can have a singular referent, as in 10.76. It is in O function, but is not marked for
case.
10.76 a                 kus@-l@-l,                          kwasa          maw n@w@k

      hear-1plsubj.vt+3fem.sgbas.vt
      ‘That one (story) is ﬁnished, we are listening to another one (as) a little base (for it)’
  This pronoun can also have a non-singular referent. The number value of its referent can be
recovered from the context.

  Unlike n@k@- which refers only to third person, n@w@k can refer to any person. In 10.78,
n@w@k refers to ‘others among us’: the personal reference is obvious from the marking on the
verb.

224     10 Closed Classes   Speakers who frequently code-switch with Tok Pisin employ narapela ‘other’ to cover both
n@k@- and n@w@k. The meaning of ‘someone; one . . . another’ can be achieved by using the
numeral ‘one’ (see §10.6). Repetition of a noun has a distributive indeﬁnite meaning, e.g. ag@k
‘one of the two sides’, ag@k ag@k ‘one side to the other’, tab@k ‘end of, side’, tab@k t@b@k ‘one
side and another’.                                  10.4 i n t e r ro gat i v e sContent questions are marked with a question word and slightly rising intonation, while
polar questions are marked by intonation only. Interrogative clauses are discussed in §20.1.3.
A question word does not have a ﬁxed position in a clause; like any constituent, if it is in
contrastive focus it tends to occupy the clause-initial position and acquire focus marking.
   Interrogatives form a heterogeneous class in terms of their meanings, syntactic function,
focus marking, and grammatical categories. Interrogatives include nouns, adjectives, adverbs,
and quantiﬁers. There are no interrogative verbs. Manambu employs the following interroga-
tive stems:
     (i) s@- ‘who; whose’;
    (ii) agwa- ‘what, which’;
   (iii) ak@- ‘where; belonging to where; when’;
   (iv) akr@l ‘where to’;
    (v) agula ‘what’s up; what for; why’;
   (vi) ata, ata ata, at@ta, atawa, at@tawa, at@taka, k@t@taka ‘how’; and
  (vii) kas ‘how many/much; which (by number)’.
(i) The pronoun s@ ‘who’ has human reference, and can be used as an argument, as head of
predicate, and as a possessive modiﬁer (‘whose’). It takes all cases, except for transportatives
and substitutive. Unlike nouns, it cannot take any modiﬁer. As shown in §7.1, this form behaves
similarly to third person non-plural personal pronouns in that it takes a linker -k@-, as shown
in 10.79 (see §7.9 on the form of the comitative with ‘who’).
10.79 ñ@n      s@-ka:wa       kwa-na-ñ@n-@k,              k@-d@
      you.fem who-obl+com stay-act.foc-2fem.sgbas.vt-conf dem.prox-masc.sg
      t@pa:m
      village+lk+loc
      ‘Who are you staying with, in this village?’
   Unlike a personal pronoun, it cannot be reduplicated. A constituent in a medial completive
clause can be questioned, as in 10.80 and 9.33. This is one of the properties of these clauses
which diﬀerentiates them from other types, especially relative and conditional clauses (see
Chapter 19). The interrogative ‘who’ in 10.80 is in dative case, required by the verb ‘ask’ (lit.
‘ﬁrst plant’):
10.80 m@n      s@-k@-k      bas s@-ku            karya-m@na
      you.masc who-obl-dat ﬁrst plant-compl.ss bring-2masc.sgsubj.vt+3fem.sgbas.vt
      ‘Who did you ask when you brought her here?’ (lit. having asked who did you bring it
      (here)?)
  When used as a possessive modiﬁer, s@ takes the oblique marker -k@- and agrees in gender
and number with the possessee, as in 10.81.
                                                                                  10.4 Interrogatives           22510.81 k@-d@              n@b@k     [s@-k@               gwalugw d@y-a-d@

      n@b@k]-ad
      mountain-3masc.sgnom
      ‘Whose clan does this mountain belong to?’ (lit. this mountain whose clan’s mountain is
      it?)
   This pronoun can have masculine or feminine singular reference, as in 10.82: the speaker
cannot see whether the person behind the door is a man or a woman. The gender and number
reference is established via agreement on the predicate.
10.82 ñ@n     s@-k@-l-al                 o m@n      s@-k@-d-ad
      you.fem who-obl-fem.sg-3fem.sgnom or you.masc who-obl-masc.sg-3masc.sgnom
      ‘Who are you-woman, or who are you-man?’
   If the speaker is not sure whether the actor was a man or a woman, or how many people
there were, plural agreement is preferred, as in 6.42.
   If the pronoun ‘who’ is used as predicate head, as in 10.82, or is marked for focus, as
in 10.83, it appears in a form reminiscent of an associative NP (as illustrated in 8.12–14),
characterized by a gender-number marker -l- ‘feminine’, -d- ‘masculine’, -bra- ‘dual’, and -di-
‘plural’, followed by a nominal predicate cross-referencing enclitic. 3
10.83 s@-k@-d-ad                  vya:d
      who-obl-masc.sg-3masc.sgnom hit+3masc.sgbas.p
      a. ‘Who is it who hit him?’
      b. ‘Who is it he hit?’
   The two readings of 10.83 have to be disambiguated by the context; the ambiguity results
from the fact that focused constituents do not distinguish case.
(ii) The pronoun agwa- ‘what, which’ is used as a non-agreeing modiﬁer to a noun with a non-
human referent, especially to the noun ja:p ‘thing’: agwa ja:p means ‘what?’, and can be used
as A, S, O, and head of predicate, e.g. 10.84.
10.84 agwa ja:p kur-na-ñ@n                al@m
      what thing do-act.foc-2fem.sgbas.vt dem.dist+fem.sg+lk+loc
      ‘What are you doing there?’
  The form agwa ja:p marked with dative case means ‘why, for what (material) reason or
purpose?’, as in 10.85:
10.85 m@n       Apat@p agwa jap@k              da-na-d@m@n
      you.masc Avatip what thing+lk+dat go.down-act.foc-2masc.sgbas.vt
      wuna:wa warya-k
      I+lk+com ﬁght-purp.ss
      ‘You, a man from Avatip, for what purpose have you come down to ﬁght with me?’
  3 A similar construction with agwa- ‘what, which’ marked for ‘double gender’ was described by Farnsworth and
Farnsworth (1966), based on the Yambon variety, e.g. agwa-l-al-a (what-fem.sg-fem.sg-3fem.sgnom) ‘What sort of
thing is it (feminine)?’; agwa-d-ad (what-masc.sg-3masc.sg.nom) ‘What is it (masculine)?’; agwa-da-di ha-di ‘What are
they (plural)?’; and agwa-da-b@r ‘What are they (dual)?’ (the last form apppears highly dubious). No such forms were
recognized as grammatical by any of the speakers I worked with.
226     10 Closed Classes   The combination agwa ja:p is very frequent. In informal discourse, the noun ja:p ‘thing’ can
be used in the meaning of ‘what’, e.g. ja:p-al? (thing-3fem.sgnom) ‘what is it?’ as a synonym of
agwa ja:p-al? (what thing-3fem.sgnom) ‘what is it?’ The form agwa- can modify other nouns,
e.g. agwa kudi ‘what language?’, agwa ma:j ‘what talk/stories are there, what’s the gossip?’ It
can co-occur with adjectival modiﬁers, e.g. agwa kwasa-kwasa-di ma:j bla-dana-di? (what small-
small-pl story talk-3plsubj.vt-3plbas.vt) ‘what little stories are they telling?’ In 10.86, agwa
modiﬁes a non-agreeing adjective ‘good’ used as head of predicate. Of all interrogatives, only
agwa can occur in exclamations, as exempliﬁed in 10.86.10.86 agwa vyak@t-al
      what good/beautiful-3fem.sgnom
      ‘What a beautiful (woman) it is!’  The form agwa- can be used as head only in non-core functions—that is, marked with
dative (agwa:k) meaning ‘why, what for’, as in 10.87, with locative (agwa:m) meaning ‘in what
location?’, with instrumental (agwar) meaning ‘with what; how’, and with comitative (agwawa)
meaning ‘with what’, as in 10.88.
  Agwa:k is very similar in meaning to agwa jap@k (in 10.85); the diﬀerence is that the latter
presupposes a longer statement of reason or purpose, and may imply a material object as a
reason, while the former is more abstract and is often used in rhetorical questions:10.87 a    agwa:k     atawa wa-ñ@na-d@wun-@k
      then what+dat thus say-2fem.sgsubj.vt-1masc.sgbas.vt-conf
      ‘Then why did you say thus to me?!’10.88 agwawa     k@-k@r
      what+com eat-des
      ‘What am I to eat (sago) with?’  Similarly to nominal demonstratives, agwa takes the accusative-locative case only in the
locative meaning. Unlike any other word class, the allative-instrumental case with agwa has
only instrumental meaning. Note that there is a special interrogative word with an allative
meaning, akr@l ‘where to’ (see (iv) ).
(iii) The pronoun ak@- ‘where, belonging to where’ is used as a modiﬁer to a noun whose
location is being questioned, and as predicate head. If it is used as a modiﬁer, the noun is
either the subject of a verbless clause, a temporal or a locative oblique, or the possessor.
The pronoun always takes gender and number agreement. Its feminine singular agreement
forms vary depending on whether it is used as head or as a modiﬁer. The masculine singular
agreement is, as expected, -d@, the dual is -b@r , and the plural is -di. This pronoun is only used
with third person reference.","[246, 247, 248, 249, 250, 251, 252, 253]"

                             21.5.4 How to address each otherAddressing each other in Manambu involves a variety of techniques, including kinship terms
and personal names. In a society with a classiﬁcatory kinship system, everyone’s relationship
to everyone else is deﬁned through kinship links—which may vary, given that many children
are adopted, and thus may be called brothers and sisters when in fact they are not so by blood.
For instance, Yuaneng addresses Yuamali’s mother Lowai as ma:m ‘elder sibling’ because
Yuaneng’s father Lumawandem had adopted the young Lowai and treated her as his daughter.
Every such instance has a story behind it: calculating kinship relationships to one another is
part of day-to-day routine, with a lot of gossip involved.
  Personal names are an object of value among the Manambu. The more names a person
has, the richer, and more respected, they are. People are typically addressed by the main name
(apas@, ‘bone name’), and only on particular occasions by their other names (s@gliak). The
588     21 Issues in Semantics and Features of Lexiconmain name can be shortened: for instance, the full name Yuamali-mæg or Yuamali-wæg is often
shortened to Yuamali, or simply to Mali. Most people also have a ‘white man’s’ name (wali
s@): such as Jacklyn, Pauline, Patricia, Paul, or James. Some, however, do not: Gemaj is one of
these. And some do not like their white names: Damel, or Dameliway, let me know immediately
that her white man’s name, Leona, meant nothing to her. Some people are typically referred
to by their white names: many call Badaibæg simply ‘Paul’. This appears to reﬂect personal
preferences, rather than any steadfast rule. Some children and teenagers, even if they are good
speakers of Manambu, do not know their ‘village name’ (when asked what it was, some used
to ask their parents, or even me—since I was supposed to ‘keep track’ of the language).
   Disentangling the multitude of names can be quite a puzzle for an outsider. It took me a
few days to work out that the lady who ﬁrst introduced herself to me as Jacklyn is actually the
same person as Mali, Yuamali, Yuamali-mæg, and Yuamali-wæg; that Patricia is also Walup or
Yuawalup; that Rex prefers to be addressed as Kawidu or Kawi; and the now late Wimali often
called herself Yabukwi. This is reminiscent of the multitude of variants and abbreviations of
the same name which baﬄe Western readers of Russian novels—except that in the Manambu
culture most names cannot be easily derived from one another. But this is not the full story as
far as addressing people goes.
   Linguistic knowledge is tantamount to material wealth among the Manambu (see §1.3).
Being well versed in totemic names belonging to diﬀerent clans, as well as personal names,
is valued most of all. In day-to-day life, this knowledge is reﬂected in the correct and creative
use of ‘address terms’ (way@pi, wa:y), a typologically unusual subclass of nouns (see §4.1.2).
   In the Manambu tradition, every clan possesses a set of terms for culturally important
objects, alongside the clan’s ‘own’ personal names. Natural objects, ﬂora, and fauna are also
divided between clans as their totems. The names of entities which belong to a particular clan
are used for addressing and farewelling members of this clan (also see discussion in Harrison
1990a: 76–7). Examples were given in 4.5–6. An address term can be used as a mode of clan
identiﬁcation, as illustrated in T2.27: Sesawi asks Kamkudi what clan he belongs to, and
Kamkudi replies ‘I am brown snake, death adder’: these are the totems of the clan group
Gla:gw, to which the Vali:k clan founded by Kamkudi belongs.
   In greeting and farewelling people, it is highly important to use the correct address terms
which reﬂect the clan of the addressee (that is, the clan of their father): this is known as way@pi
s@- ‘address.term call’. Mentioning an address term of their mother’s clan is a sign of particular
endearment and respect. The beginning of a conversation, or of a letter (as in 21.77), is more
often than not accompanied by one or more address terms.
21.77 wun-a        ñamus           yara yab@nay           kwa-na-ñ@n
      I-lk+fem.sg younger.sibling well Maliau.addr.fem stay-act.foc-2fem.sgbas.vt
      ‘Are you OK, my younger sister, woman of Maliau clan?’
  From the form of the greeting it is obvious that the person to whom it is addressed is a
woman belonging to the Maliau clan (part of the Wulwi-Ñawi clan group: see Table 1.1). The
same applies to a farewell:
21.78 yara ma:y     yab@nay         makaj@wi        ga:j          tapwuk
      well go.impv Maliau.addr.fem Maliau.addr small.pelican hen
      ‘Oﬀ you go (goodbye), you woman of Maliau clan, daughter of a woman of Sablap clan’
   The address forms here reﬂect the fact that the addressee is a woman belonging to the Maliau
clan, but that her mother’s clan is Sablap (part of the Nabul-Sablap clan group): since ga:j
‘small pelican-like white bird’ and tapwuk ‘chicken’ are the totems of this clan.
                                                         21.5 Speech formulae, greetings        589   We saw in §4.1.2 that some of the address terms are words in Manambu. So, bap ‘moon’—a
totem of the Maliau, Ñakau, and other clans for the Wulwi-Ñawi group—is an address term
for their members. Wapi ‘bird’ is an address term for the Nagudau subclan of the Wulwi-
Ñawi group, and wud@b ‘spirit, dead people’ is the term for the Nabul clan, while wa:m
‘white cockatoo’ is used for the Wapanab, Makem, and Wargab clans of the Gla:gw clan
group. The name of a clan itself can be used as an address term, as in yimal ‘address term
for someone from the Yimal clan’. The term mana:b—the denomination of the Manambu—
appears in the address term apwi mana:b, for the Maliau clan. A compound can be used as an
address term, e.g. amn@bi ‘bow and arrow’, for members of the Wapanab clan.
   The address term g@ñap used for members of the Yimal clan (Gla:gw clan group) is puzzling:
this is the name of a bush people whom Manambu had exterminated in the past. Stories of
the G@ñap wars are widespread (see their description by Harrison 1993: 67–9; some of them
are reminiscent of the descriptions of the Gala: see Chapter 1). Harrison hypothesizes that the
G@ñap could have been speakers of the Sawos language or some variant of it. These people
are referred to as either g@ñap or g@ñap-kwalap (kwalap is the ‘shadowy’ equivalent of g@ñap—
see §22.3). We can recall, from Text 2, that a Gala man was adopted into one of the clans of the
Gla:gw group. This clan group is associated with dark things and bush in general. It is perhaps
no wonder that the term g@ña, also used to refer to the original ‘bush people’, has been ‘reused’
as an address term for a clan group associated with bush, earth, and all things ‘dark’.
   Numerous address terms are not used for any other purpose—apwi ‘address term for Sarak
clan’, to do with a totemic term for ‘cassowary’, is one such example. (We will see in §22.2.3
that apwi appears as a farewell term in Kwoma-Manambu pidgin (Bowden 1997), no doubt
due to the fact that the Kwoma (Kum) are associated with cassowaries in the Manambu stories
(as told by John Sepaywus).)
   Other examples include ñirvi, makaj@wi ‘address terms for Maliau clan’, maguni for Gla:gw
clan group, kaligab for the Wapanab clan, and so on. The term makati is used to address
members of Gla:gw clan group; this term also appears to be used to address women of the
Maliau clan by members of the Gla:gw.
   That is, successful communication is grounded in the knowledge of the addressee’s and their
family’s clan membership. This knowledge comes naturally to most Manambu people—given
the importance of one’s paternal and maternal relatives—for bride price, mortuary payment,
and various obligations. But being proﬁcient in a variety of address forms is a highly valued
asset.
   The address forms are used by adults of all generations and religious aﬃliations (even devout
Christians—many of whom condemn ‘heretic customs’ such as the mortuary payment—
appreciate their use and knowledge). To get them wrong is shameful; and discussing the
appropriate address forms for various clans is one of the favourite topics of conversation. In
stories, address terms are used between protagonists of all sorts, including animals (e.g. turtles).
The speakers use address terms when spontaneously talking to pet animals: for instance, a tree
kangaroo (yayi:b), a totem of the Gla:gw clan group, was spontaneously addressed as makati—
a member of the Gla:gw clan.
   Address terms are just one aspect of the general principle which permeates the Manambu
language, and culture—name ownership and multiple synonymy (see §1.3).
   Besides owning their own, particular totems, each Manambu subclan ‘owns’ one or more
special totemic names for culturally salient items, such as crocodile (general term mu), totemic
trees and crotons (kwalami), stone (kabak), dog (a:s), slit drum (ra:b), spirit (apawul), totemic
haze (mali), house (wi), ceremonial house (kara:b, sa:y), residential area (yar@g), spear (væy),
ceremonial mound (t@pwi), grass skirt (kwa:r), canoe (val), wind (ma:r), mountain (n@b@k),
590     21 Issues in Semantics and Features of Lexiconfood storing basket (k@bi), and many more. This creates multiple synonymy, restricted just to
nouns. Not too many people know the full set of terms nowadays. The terms themselves are
a potential matter for dispute ultimately resulting in name debates (saki). A full analysis and
a list of these names is currently being compiled by Pauline Yuaneng Luma Laki, with the
assistance of such knowledgeable elders as John Sepaywus (a major s@b@k, oﬃce holder of a
ceremonial division in Avatip) and old ladies including Gemaj, Maguniway, Saws@pali, and
Walin@m. Going into the structure and ownership of these names (a potentially sensitive issue)
lies beyond the scope of this grammar.
   Name ownership goes hand in hand with ownership of landmarks and areas (wa:gw ‘area’).
The term for ‘owned valuable thing’ is ja:b. For instance, the Ambunti mountain, which towers
over the settlement itself and can be seen from Avatip on a ﬁne day, is said to belong to the
Ñakau clan. Yet its name in Manambu, Mak@mawi, is said to have been bestowed upon it by
the Yimal clan, as was explained to me:
21.79 Ñakau d@y-a-di ja:p Yimal saki-taka-da-l
      Ñakau they-lk-pl thing Yimal bestow.name-put-3plsubj.p-3fem.sgbas.p
      ‘It (the Ambunti mountain) is the property of Ñakau clan, the Yimal clan bestowed the
      name (Mak@mawi) onto it’
  The name Ambunti is believed to be a name of a totemic ceremonial house, ultimately
belonging to the Ñakau:
21.80 Ambunti karab-@                sa:d,                   Ñakau d@y-a-di n@b@k
      Ambunti ceremonial.house-lk name+3masc.sgnom Ñakau they-lk-pl mountain
      d@y-a-d@         sa:d
      they-lk-masc.sg name+3masc.sgnom
      ‘Ambunti is a name of a ceremonial house, it is the name of a mountain belonging to the
      Ñakau’
   Knowledge of the multitude of totemic names, synonyms, and address terms is aﬀected by
encroaching obsolescence. This is one of the signs of language endangerment, and culture loss,
among the younger generation of the Manambu lamented by the older generation in their
‘discourse of nostalgia’. We address this in the next chapter.
        22        Genetic and Areal Relationships, and New
        Developments in the LanguageWe will discuss genetically inherited and areally diﬀused features of the Manambu lexicon
and grammar, before addressing code-switching with Tok Pisin and English, and further new
developments in the language.                        22.1 manambu as a ndu la nguageAll languages of the Ndu family show uniformity in their pronominal paradigms (see Appen-
dix 22.1), and in a large part of their nominal and verbal lexicon. All the Ndu languages
have cases for core and peripheral arguments. Verbal categories vary in their marking and
semantics.
   The Ndu languages are predominantly suﬃxing, with few preﬁxes, such as the imperative a-,
and the causative-manipulative kay-, both attested in Manambu. They are strictly nominative-
accusative, with pronominal cross-referencing for A/S recently evolved out of pronouns. Only
Manambu and Gala cross-reference more than one argument. A reconstruction of Proto-Ndu
phonology and morphology is in Aikhenvald (forthcoming b).
   In terms of grammatical complexity and richness of forms, Manambu and Gala (or Ngala)
exceed other Ndu languages. Gala is unusual in a number of further ways, such as the pronom-
inal system (see below), pervasive preﬁxing, complex vowel system, and lack of prenasalization
of stops. When, on my visit to the Swakap village, I ﬁrst enquired after the name of the
language, I was told that it was /gala duŸ p/, and not /∗N gala/—the latter was condemned as a
way the Manambu refer to this language. (We can recall, from §1.4.1, that the old enmities
between the Gala and the Manambu dating back to the Gala wars are still alive in people’s
memories: the Avatip people recall recent hostile attacks by the Gala.)
   Distinguishing two genders, roughly deﬁned as ‘masculine’ and ‘feminine’, is a pervasive
feature of the Ndu languages. In terms of its semantics, gender assignment is sex based
for human referents. It is shape and size based for referents of other groups (see Chapter
5 above), at least in Manambu, Iatmul, and Gala. In the Yangoru dialect of Boiken, the
assignment is based on size and also hardness or softness of the referent (hard objects,
such as ironwood and hard-textured yam varieties, are assigned masculine gender and soft
objects, such as soft tuber varieties, are female: Paul Roscoe, p.c.). Gender marking is overt
in personal pronouns and in verbs, and covert in numerous other contexts (such as adjectival
agreement).
   Gender marking is uniform across the Ndu family. Cognates of the Manambu masculine
singular -d (cf. masculine singular pronoun d@) are found in Iatmul d1 ‘he; 3masc.sg agreement
marker’, Hanga Kundi (West Wosera) dé ‘personal pronoun; subject agreement suﬃx’ (Wendel
1993: 59), Ambulas dé (Kundama, Wilson, and Sapai 1987) ‘he’, and Boiken (Yangoru) d@
(Freudenburg 1979).

"
                       8.2.3 Possessor cross-referencing on the verbSince the possessed noun, and not the possessor, is the head of any possessive noun phrase in
that it controls agreement on the modiﬁers and on the predicate, the possessor cannot normally
be cross-referenced on the verb. It can be cross-referenced occasionally, if in contrastive focus,
178     8 Possessionas in 8.26 (the possessive construction here is of D2 type). The cross-referenced possessor is
underlined.
8.26 [wun-a       kui] k@-kwa-dana-wun
     I-lk+fem.sg meat eat-hab-3plsubj.vt-1fem.sgbas.vt
     ‘They used to eat my ﬂesh’ (lit. they used to eat me (on) my ﬂesh) (said the turtle)
   As shown in §7.3, under (iv), the locative-accusative -Vm case can mark a third argument
of ditransitive verbs, if the beneﬁciary or recipient is fully aﬀected, or the gift is permanent
(as in 7.27). Examples like 7.26 (‘The Gala married women from/of Washkuk’, or ‘belonging
to Washkuk’) and 8.27 can be considered instances of possessor raising since the possessor is
treated as the object:
8.27 [k@              a:b] vya-l@pa-d@-l                          [a

     takwa:m]
     woman+lk+acc/loc
     ‘He smashed the woman’s head’ (lit. he head-smashed that woman)
  In 7.26 and in 8.27, the possessor (‘Washkuk’ and ‘woman’ respectively) does not form one
noun phrase with the possessed (‘woman’ and ‘head’, respectively). The possessive relation-
ship is understood from the context; and the locative-accusative case indicates the complete
aﬀectedness of the possessor in each case. This ‘possessor raising’ is available for body part
possession only.
        9        Derivation and Compounding
Manambu has a few derivational mechanisms which change word class (§9.1) and a number of
those which do not (§9.2). Nominal compounding is discussed in §9.3.                     9.1 wo r d c la s s -changing derivationsFully productive action nominalizations are derived through full reduplication of the verb’s
root. These are discussed in §9.1.1, in the light of other functions of reduplicated verbal root.
Non-productive deverbal nominalizations and a partially productive adjectivizing derivation
are addressed in §9.1.2. There are no morphological means for deriving a verb from a noun.
One adjective, vyak@t ‘good, beautiful’, is related to a verb vyakanaku- ‘correct, improve’ via a
unique process. (Neither has cognates in other Ndu languages.)                9.1.1 Full reduplication of verbal root and its functionsFull reduplication of verbal root is a productive means of deriving action nominalizations, e.g.
war- ‘go up’, warwar ‘going up’; nas(@)- ‘count’, nas@nas ‘counting’ (see §2.2.1 on the insertion
of @ to break an unauthorized consonant cluster); kawar- ‘take up’, kawar-kawar- ‘carrying
and going up’; yawi kur- (work do) ‘work (verb)’, yawi kur-kur ‘doing work (noun)’.
   If a root ends in -u and undergoes full reduplication, the ﬁnal vowel is reduced to -w and,
if it follows a stop, is realized as labialization of the last consonant, as in waku ‘go out’,
wakuwakw ‘going out’. If a verb root has a structure CVC1 C2 V, and C2 is y, the ﬁnal vowel
is dropped and y becomes i , as in warya- ‘ﬁght’, warya-wari ‘ﬁghting’. Monosyllabic roots with
the vowel a acquire the shape CaC@ when reduplicated, e.g. da- ‘go down’, da-d@ ‘going down’,
ra- ‘cut’, ra-r@ ‘cutting’. Nominalizations are stressed on the last syllable; whether they form
one phonological word depends on the syllable count (see §2.5). Nominalizations can occur
in S or O function, as obliques and as part of complex predicates (see §4.1.2). They cannot
be part of a possessive NP or be modiﬁed. All nominalizations have the verb’s argument
structure and argument marking (their A/S is Ø marked, as in 9.1 and 9.4, and their O can
be unmarked, as in 9.2–3, or marked with accusative-locative case following the principles in
§7.2, e.g. 4.7).
   But is every reduplicated verb a nominalization? We will see below that the reduplicated
forms diﬀer in their semantics and in their syntactic possibilities depending on their function
and the type of additional marking they take. The broad meaning ‘action nominalization’
appears to be fully applicable to some combinations of form and function of reduplicated verb
root, and only partly so to others. We will use this term here for convenience. At the end of this
section we return to the problem of whether all these can be analysed as one category.
180      9 Derivation and CompoundingI. Nominalizations unmarked for case are used as S in 4.7–8 and 9.1; and as O in 9.2. They
cannot be used as A.
9.1 [kasan war-war] vyak@t-a
    peanut go.up-red good-3fem.sgnom
    ‘Peanuts are coming up ﬁne’ (lit. Peanuts going up is ﬁne)
  Deverbal nominalizations in O function are employed as complementation strategies, with
the verb ‘know’, as in 9.2, and ‘ﬁnish’, as in 4.8.
9.2 [na:gw k@-k@] b@r b@ta:y laku-bra
    sago eat-red 3du already know-3dusubj.vt+3fem.sgbas.vt
    ‘They were eating sago, they already knew how to eat sago’ (lit. they already knew sago
    eating)
   ‘Peanuts coming up’ in 9.1 and ‘sago eating’ in 9.2 are diﬀerent from possessive constructions
of type B (§8.1.1), for two reasons. First, given the right pragmatic circumstances, another
possessive construction (types C–E) can replace a B-type possessive construction. In contrast,
no possessive construction can be used instead of an action-nominalization structure. Secondly,
an object of a nominalization can take the accusative-locative case if fully aﬀected, as in 4.7. In
all of 9.1–2 and 4.7–8 nominalizations are employed as complementation strategies (see IX in
§19.8).
   An action nominalization can occur in the predicate slot, as in 9.3 (predicate is focused: see
§20.3).
9.3 k@                  lap       kwa:j    k@-k@-l-a
    dem.prox+fem.sg banana ﬂying.fox eat-red-3fem.sgnom-3fem.sgnom
    ‘This is the way of eating of bananas by ﬂying fox’
  As can be seen from these examples, nominalizations are assigned feminine gender, in
accordance with its functionally unmarked character (see §5.2.3).
  Nominalizations are frequently used as modiﬁers to nouns, e.g. vya-vy-a ta:b (hit+lk-red-
lk hand) ‘right hand, lit. hitting hand’, wusau-wusau s@p (itch-red skin) ‘itchy skin’, væt-@-
væt-@j @pis (bite-lk-red-lk ant) ‘an ant that bites a lot’. An alternative interpretation for these
constructions as analogous to relative clauses is in §19.2.2.
II. Dative-aversive-marked nominalizations are used to mark a purpose, or a goal expressed
with what translates as a clausal complement. These are used where one expects the dative-
aversive case, as in 9.4 and 13.81–2.
9.4 kap@-n kwa-na                             [n@k@-di ñanugw ya-ya:k]
    wait-seq stay-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt other-pl children come-red+dat
    ‘She is waiting for the other children to come’ (lit. she is waiting for other children coming)
  The dative-aversive marked nominalizations are used with a variety of expressions with
negative meaning, such as ‘forbid, refuse’, literally, ‘say no’, as in 9.5, or ‘feel shame’, as in 9.6.
9.5 [m@n        kap@-ka:p da-da:k]             ma: wa-na-wun
    you.masc self+lk-self go.down-red+dat no say-act.foc-1fem.sgbas.vt
    ‘I forbid you to go down fully on your own’ (lit. I say no to you going by yourself)
9.6 [k@-ka:k]     d@ wap     sayid
    eat-red+dat he shame feel+3masc.sgbas.vt
    ‘He felt ashamed to eat’
                                                       9.1 Word class-changing derivations           181   This is in line with the aversive meaning of the -Vk case. The nominalizations are also used
in a more clearly aversive, ‘for fear of’, sense, as in 9.7:9.7 [ank@l s@p kag@l yi-ya:k]         marasin-al
    nettle skin sore go-red+dat medicine-3fem.sgnom
    ‘Nettle is a medicine against sore skin’ (lit. nettle is a medicine for fear of skin going sore)Dative-aversive-marked nominalizations are used in yet another sense—that of future projec-
tion, as in 9.8.9.8 [l@-k@-d@         ñan kiya-kiya:k] atawa kur@-d
    she-lk-masc.sg child die-red+dat thus do-3masc.sgbas.p
    ‘It (the cat) was acting like this (as a premonition) for her little boy dying’We saw that a nominalization unmarked for case can be used with the expression ‘be hard’ in
4.7 where the diﬃculty is not limited to the future. If a future diﬃculty is implied, a dative-
aversive-marked nominalization is employed:9.9 [apaw@l b@u-m         t@-na]                           [ [al@k      suan
    spirit    haze-loc stay-act.foc+3fem.sg.bas.vt this.is.why hard
    yi-na-wun]                      [apaw@l-a:m v@-væk] ]
    go-act.foc-1fem.sgbas.vt spirit-lk+acc see-red+dat
    ‘A spirit is in a haze, this is why it is hard for me to (try and) see the spirit (in future)’   The dative-aversive nominalization can be considered a type of complementation strategy
(§19.8). Unlike other complementation strategies, they often follow the inﬂected verb. This
same form is also used in clauses introduced with k@pa:b ‘in case’—see §13.7.
   Dative-aversive nominalizations can be derived from any verb, with the exception of verbs
of C@l/r structure. So, the verb b@l-/bla- ‘talk’ forms a nominalization blab@l ‘talking’; but
not ∗ blabl@k; the same-subject purposive bla:k is used instead (see §13.4). Such gaps in the
paradigm of dative-aversive nominalizations show that their morphological possibilities do not
fully coincide with those of nominalizations discussed at I above. This could be an argument
in favour of analysing them as a separate category.
III. Terminative case-marked nominalizations marked with Vb can only be used with the
polyfunctional verb t@- as support verb. The meaning of the construction is ‘to be on the brink
of doing something; to do just so’:9.10 ñ@n-a-d@             majan          kui-kuib         t@-na-dian
     you.fem-lk-masc.sg funerary.ritual give-red+term have/be-act.foc-1plbas.vt
     ‘We are about to oﬀer you a funerary rite (because we thought you were dead)’The support verb can be omitted, if its subject is coreferential with that of a juxtaposed
clause:9.11 [kuprap-@ du taba:m               r@-ku]      [ya:n]        [r@-tua
     bad-lk       man hand+lk+loc sit-compl.ss come+seq sit-1sgsubj.vt+3fem.sgbas.vt
     aka                         kiya-kiya:b]
     dem.dist.react.top.fem.sg die-red+term
     ‘Sitting in the bad man’s hands, having come, here I sit, on the brink of dying’
182     9 Derivation and CompoundingThe meanings of -Vb with nominalizations agree with the general semantics of the terminative
case (see §7.6). Noun phrases marked with terminative case are typically used as obliques,
unlike nominalizations with the same marking.
IV. Nominalizations as parts of complex predicates with the verb t@- ‘be, stand, have’ as
a support verb have an intensive and habitual meaning, as in 9.12. Compare 9.12a, with an
inﬂected verb, and 9.12b, with a nominalization as part of a complex predicate.9.12a day-a:k       warsamad
      they-lk+dat be.angry+3masc.sgbas.vt
      ‘He is angry at them’9.12b day-a:k       warsam-warsam t@-na-d
      they-lk+dat be.angry-red    be-act.foc-3masc.sgbas.vt
      ‘He is very angry at them’   The verb bla means ‘speak; say magic spells’; a person who keeps saying magic spells is called
yanu bla-b@l t@-kwa-na-d-@ du (spell say-red stand/have-hab-act.foc-3masc.sgbas.vt-lk man).
Similarly, wuk@mar means ‘forget’, wuk@mar wuk@mar t@- means ‘be forgetful’.
   The meaning of a reduplicated nominalization may be only partially predictable: for
instance, reduplicated r@p ‘be full, satisﬁed’ within a complex predicate means ‘equal, same
as’, as in 4.47.
   An analytical problem arises here. At the end of §4.2.2 we mentioned multiple word class
membership of fully reduplicated verbal roots. Most of them can be used as inﬂected verbs
(in which case they are interpreted as intensive aspect forms: see §12.8), and also as parts of
complex predicates. This was illustrated with examples 4.47–8; also see 9.13a–b:9.13a a-di        pato wali-wali        t@-na-di
      dem.dist-pl duck walk.around-red be-act.foc-3plbas.vt
      ‘Those ducks keep wandering around’9.13b a-di        pato wali-wali-na-di
      dem.dist-pl duck walk.around-red-act.foc-3plbas.vt
      ‘Those ducks are wandering around all the time’   For dynamic verbs, like wali- ‘wander around’, there appears to be a subtle diﬀerence:
nominalizations as parts of complex predicates refer to an atemporal action that keeps repeat-
ing, while inﬂected verbs describe something that is happening either right now or at some
particular time (this is why the action focus marker is preferred in examples like 9.13a–b). For
stative verbs there is no such diﬀerence.
   In addition, a reduplicated verb root can occur as part of a complex predicate with support
verbs other than t@- ‘be, stand’, with the basic meaning of action nominalization. The noise
of rolling is described in 9.14, and this warrants the use of the polyfunctional verb na- ‘be (of
natural phenomena, including noise)’:9.14 t@m@l-t@m@l ata na:l
     roll-red     then be:nat+3fem.sgbas.vt
     ‘There was a noise of (him) rolling and rolling’
                                                      9.1 Word class-changing derivations     183   The reduplicated root triggers feminine agreement, like any nominalization in S function.
Examples like 9.14 are infrequent; nevertheless, they point towards a diﬀerent nature of redu-
plicated verb roots with a support verb and verbal nominalizations.
V. Emphatic nominalizations are used as manner modiﬁers to a semantically similar (or the
same) verb, as in 9.15.
9.15 wuk@-wuk wuk@-tua
     hear-red hear-1sgsubj.vt+3fem.sgbas.vt
     ‘I am just listening’ (not saying anything; lit. listening I listen)
  The emphatic nominalization constructions often have a frustrative connotation: in 9.16
there is an overt contrast between ‘just hearing’ and ‘really talking’.
9.16 wuk@-wuk wuk@-na                       yi-yi      suan yi-na
     hear-red hear-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt talk-red hard go-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt
     ‘She does hear (understand) (the language), talking is diﬃcult’ (lit. hearing she hears,
     talking is diﬃcult)
  A nominalization containing a diﬀerent, but semantically similar, root can modify a verb,
denoting a manner in which the action is performed, as in 9.17:
9.17 væs@-væs ma:y
     step-red go.impv
     ‘Go by stepping carefully’
  Just occasionally can a reduplicated verb root be used to modify a verb of a diﬀerent
semantic group, as in 9.18:
9.18 wiya:m          aw       t@m@l-t@m@l aw         t@m@l-t@m@l ata gra:l
     house+lk+loc in.turn roll-red          in.turn roll-red      then cry+3fem.sgbas.vt
     ‘At home she then cried in turn rolling and rolling (lamenting her drowned son)’
VI. Nominalizations in negative constructions as predicate heads are a means of expressing
negative obligation. This is consistent with a typologically widely attested pattern whereby
non-verbal forms are used to express curt commands and strong prohibitions (Aikhenvald
forthcoming a). In 9.19, the mother was trying to explain to her baby daughter that one does
not breastfeed while walking along the road:
9.19 yab@-wa       m@ñ k@-k@ ma:
     road+lk-com breast eat-red neg
     ‘One does not breastfeed while walking’ (lit. There is no breastfeeding along the road)
  Such negative statements can refer to something that has not happened yet (as in 9.19 said
before the girl had started breastfeeding—see 7.80), or to something that has already occurred.
  The position of the negator is congruent with its position in clauses with a non-verbal
predicate (see §14.1.2). However, an additional problem arises here. We will see in §14.3.3 that
the negative form of the reduplicated intensive aspect of a verb coincides with the reduplicated
verb stem, that is, a nominalization. In negative future, the negator is postposed to the negative
form of an inﬂected verb, making a construction like 9.20 (and in T1.7) inherently ambiguous
between (a) a negated nominalization as a means of expressing negative obligation; and (b) a
negative future of the intensive aspect.

     (a) ‘She (the moon) is not to see my wife’
     (b) ‘She (the moon) will not be intensively staring at my wife’
  This ambiguity can be resolved by the context. Interestingly, both readings are possible in
the humorous story from which the example 9.20 is taken. The story is about a naive newly
wed young man who had no idea that women menstruate, literally, ‘see moon’, once a month.
He decides to stop the moon from seeing his wife by killing the moon (cf. 3.15), and says 9.20.
  The reduplicated forms discussed in I–V cannot be negated independently (see §14.1.3). For
instance, a reduplicated deverbal nominalization as part of a complex predicate (IV above) is
negated in the same way as any other clause containing the support verb t@- ‘stand, be, have’.

     forget-red            neg.hab stand-hab-act.foc-1fem.sgbas.vt
     ‘I am never forgetful’
The diﬀerences in semantics and functions of reduplicated verb root discussed in I–VI are
summarized in Table 9.1.
   Just like with cases (§7.10), one may wish to follow a ‘lumper’ approach, and consider all
instances of reduplicated verbs in Manambu as essentially one category with six diﬀerent
functions. The fact that six diﬀerent functions are in a complementary distribution as to the
additional marking and syntactic functions of the reduplicated root is a strong argument in
favour of this approach.
   Alternatively, one can follow a ‘splitter’ approach, and distinguish several semantic and
functional categories expressed with homophonous forms: (i) deverbal action nominalization:
structures I–III and VI; and (ii) non-inﬂected verb with intensive-habitual meanings: IV and
V. Once used as head of predicates, deverbal action nominalizations are reinterpreted as a
modality (§13.7).
   The meaning diﬀerences between reduplicated verb root in constructions I–III and in IV are
substantial. In addition, the reduplicated verb root as part of a complex predicate in IV can be
replaced with an inﬂected verb form containing the same reduplicated verbal root, as shown
in 9.13a–b. Reduplicated verb roots as parts of complex predicates may well be considered
a special grammatical form of a verb, which is only superﬁcially similar to nominalizations
discussed under I–III. The two analytic alternatives are equally valid.","[204, 205, 206, 207, 208, 209, 210, 211]"
"   In addition, just as in the majority of the world’s languages, subjects are targets of impera-
tives, they control reﬂexives, and there is a ‘same-subject’ requirement in constructions involv-
ing the two modal verbs (20.25a–c and 20.58)—see Dixon (1994: 111–42). There are no other
pivot restrictions on coreferential deletion—as is to be expected in a language with switch-
reference.
   Given such robust grammatical criteria, there should not be any problem in identifying
subjects in each particular case. And yet there are. Body part constructions, copula clauses
referring to mental and physical states, and impersonal constructions are the cases in point. We
saw in §17.4, §18.3, and §20.1.1 (A) above that such constructions have two cross-referencing
patterns: the verb can either take third person feminine cross-referencing or it can cross-
reference the actual experiencer. Examples are at 20.31–5, and also in §17.4. The cross-
referencing depends on topicality: the experiencer is cross-referenced only if highly topical.
   And when used in a dependent clause, such constructions are marked for diﬀerent subjects
even if the subjects have the same referent. Examples like 20.62 may sound nonsensical: ‘they’
are hungry and the same ‘they’ will come—and yet, the subject is marked as ‘diﬀerent’.20.62 [ka:m yasa-l@-k]                     [ya-k-na-di]
      hunger be:feel-3fem.sg-compl.ds come-fut-act.foc-3plsubj.vt
      ‘If/when they feel hungry, they will come’ (lit. if/when hunger feels, they will come)This is in fact the most frequent situation—also see 18.24 and 20.36a. So, is a body part or the
noun referring to a bodily state the subject here? We return to this issue shortly.
   It should be noted that, as we saw in §18.3 (18.26), if the experiencer is topical, the situation is
diﬀerent. Then, the experiencer can be treated as ‘same subject’ with respect to switch-reference
even within a body part construction, if the subject is indeed the same. A rare example is at
20.37. Or if the subject is diﬀerent, it is marked as diﬀerent; but the experiencer remains cross-
referenced on the polyfunctional verb referring to a bodily state. An example is at 20.63.

      ‘After he’d felt hunger, she (mother) having gone to the previously mentioned place,
      having brought the sago she’d fried by carrying it gave it to him’
The man in 20.63 is the one who is hungry. Consequently, ‘he’ is cross-referenced with a
masculine singular marker on the polyfunctional copula verb yasa-, within a medial clause.
The subject of this clause is diﬀerent from that in the subsequent clause: the work is done by
one of his mothers. That is, diﬀerent-subject marking in 20.63 is sensible—it shows that one
person (man) was hungry and another person (woman) came, brought sago, and fed him.
   We can conclude that if the experiencer is cross-referenced and is topical it is the subject.
Otherwise it is not, even if it is overtly stated, because it does not trigger same-subject marking
or get cross-referenced on the verb. These constructions can also be considered impersonal.
This is plausible, given that third person singular cross-referencing is used in constructions
with no subject at all, such as sentences with modal verbs at 20.25a. Here, the body part or
the expression of bodily state such as ‘hunger’ cannot be considered the subject because it
behaves as a copula complement. A similar situation obtains with impersonal constructions
which include complex predicates such as suan yi- (diﬃcult go-) ‘be diﬃcult’ (see §4.1.2), and
a corresponding loan from Tok Pisin hat (used with the support verb t@-). In 20.64, 13.80, and
T3.33, the support verb yi- takes third person feminine cross-referencing. All these statements
have a generic meaning—one does not eat rotten bananas:
20.64 [bapi t@-dana]                               [suan    yi-k-na]
      rotten become-3plbas.vt+3fem.sgsubj.vt diﬃcult go-fut-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt
      [k@ka:k]
      consume+red+dat
      ‘If they (bananas) become rotten, it will be diﬃcult to eat (them)’
   An experiencer cannot be added—but an S can. And it can be expressed with a nominaliza-
tion as a complementation strategy, as in T3.20 and T3.33, or with a sequencing -n form:
20.65 [k@k@pa:t kur@-n] [k@                  tami: suan ya:l]
      food       get-seq dem.prox.fem.sg area diﬃcult go+3fem.sgbas.p
      ‘It was diﬃcult to get food in this area’
   A clause used as a complementation strategy can contain an object (ya:m ‘smell’ in T3.20
and k@k@pa:t ‘food’ in 20.65). But is the clause itself a subject? Presumably, yes—at least
based on formal reasons. First, the feminine singular cross-referencing on the verb is the
least functionally marked, and hence likely to be used in constructions with non-prototypical
subjects (see Aikhenvald 2000: 28–44).
   Secondly, as far as switch-reference-sensitive markers go, constructions like those in T3.20
and T3.33 are treated in the grammar as having diﬀerent subjects from that in the main clause,
even if the experiencer of the diﬃculty is the same as the subject of the adjacent clause. An
example is at T3.35: the predicate of the dependent clause is cross-referenced for diﬀerent
subject; and the snake is the main character and the subject of this whole sentence.
                                                                20.1 Major constituents       533  Another option is to cross-reference the experiencer on the verb—then the experiencer has
to be overtly stated, as in 20.66. The experiencer is highly topical: the hawk is stressing the
diﬃculty he has in entering the house without a key:
20.66 [wiya:r            wula-wula:k] [suan        yi-na-d@wun-@k]
      house+lk+all enter-red+dat diﬃcult go-act.foc-1masc.sgbas.vt-conf
      ‘It is diﬃcult for me to enter the house’ (lit. I am diﬃcult to enter the house)
   Such a topical experiencer has yet another crucial subject property: it controls switch-
reference. In 20.67, the same person experienced diﬃculties in talking and got into the hands
of an evil man:
20.67 [wun yi-y@      suan     yi-ku]          [kuprap-@ du taba:r
      I      talk-red diﬃcult go-compl.ss bad-lk          man hand+lk+all
      wula-lwun-@k]
      enter-1fem.sgbas.p-conf
      ‘As it was diﬃcult for me to talk (lit. as I was diﬃcult to talk), I got into the hands of a
      bad man’
  Neither body part constructions, nor copula clauses or impersonal constructions, can form
imperatives or reﬂexives, or be used in constructions with modal verbs—which means that
these universal criteria for subjecthood are not applicable here.
  Bodily and mental processes in Papuan languages are very often expressed with ‘impersonal’
constructions, which are problematic with respect to their subjecthood. The title of Pawley, Gi,
Majnep, and Kias’s (2000) ‘Hunger acts on me . . . ’ speaks for itself: the problems we have
just addressed for Manambu are pervasive in the whole area—also see Pawley (forthcoming),
Roberts (2001), and Priestley (2002). Compared to other Papuan languages, body part and
impersonal constructions in Manambu are fairly limited. And the experiencer is never marked
as an object. There is also a strong correlation between the topicality of an experiencer and its
potential subjecthood.
  We conclude that in all such constructions in Manambu the topical participant has the
formal properties of a subject. This is congruent with the idea that subjects tend to be
grammaticalized topics (see, for instance, Keenan 1987: 103–4; and discussion in Dixon 1994:
11–30). It is interesting to note that subjecthood and topicality are closely intertwined just
in this instance, so much so that one is tempted to say that subjecthood in body part and
impersonal constructions is determined entirely by pragmatics.
  Verbless clauses are also potentially problematic in terms of how their subjects are to
be identiﬁed. Clauses with non-verbal predicates other than adverbial and reactivated topic
demonstratives are pretty straightforward in this respect: we recall, from §20.1.3 above, that
their subject is cross-referenced on the predicate itself with cross-referencing enclitics. When
used in dependent clauses, non-verbal predicates have to be used with a support verb which
then also cross-references the subject constituent.
  But verbless clauses and clauses with adverbial and reactivated topic demonstratives have no
subject cross-referencing. Neither can they be used in dependent clauses.
  Since the predicate is marked with the suﬃx -n- in both clauses with adverbial and reactivated
topic demonstratives (see 20.52b), the other obligatory constituent can be safely identiﬁed
with the subject. This other constituent—e.g. ‘food’ in 20.52b—triggers gender and number
agreement on the demonstrative in the predicate slot, which makes it similar to a subject
(A/S). The order of constituents is ﬁxed: the predicate always comes last. We thus conclude
that the non-predicate noun phrase in non-verbal clauses with adverbial and reactivated topic
534      20 Clause Types and Discourse-Pragmatic Devicesdemonstratives as predicates is subject-like enough to be considered on a par with other
subjects.
   The situation in verbless clauses is less clear. In clauses of the naming type, there is semantic
agreement between the ﬁrst and the second noun phrase. The order is ﬁxed; and the choice
of the second NP depends on the ﬁrst. And if a ‘naming’ verbless clause is rephrased as a
non-verbal clause, the ‘name’ is in the predicate slot and the person named is the subject. This
allows us to hypothesize that the ‘name’ occupies the predicate slot, and the person named is
the subject.
   The same line of argument holds for verbless clauses with a reactivated topic demonstrative
in the second position—such as 20.52a. There is also some grammatical agreement between the
two constituents: so, in a verbless clause apawul ada (spirit dem.dist.react.top+masc.sg) ‘that
is a (masculine) spirit’ the masculine form is determined by the ﬁrst noun phrase. We can thus
suggest that the ﬁrst noun phrase is subject-like, and the second is not. Following the principles
of analogy with similar clauses, we can stipulate that the question word heads the predicate in
20.54, 10.98, 10.100–2. The situation with verbless clauses of other subtypes is just as murky:
the notion of subject does not appear to be applicable at all to the one-word clauses like those
in 20.53a and 20.55.
   The category of a syntactic subject—A and S—is highly relevant for Manambu (despite its
limited applicability to verbless clauses). What about other grammatical relations?
B. The category of object (O). We saw in §7.3 that the direct object (O) is often marked with
accusative case. An O can also be cross-referenced on the verb in the second position—see
§3.1—and it can be referred to with a reactivated topic demonstrative (§3.3 and §10.2.3). The
O is added to an intransitive verb as a result of applying the morphological causative kay- (see
§16.2.1). But while accusative marking is just about exclusive to a direct object, the other two
properties are not. In particular, any non-subject constituent—with the exception of speech
reports and copula complements—can be cross-referenced on the verb in the second position,
provided it is topical. Then, an ‘object’ is just a part of a more general category which can
be negatively deﬁned as ‘non-subject’. This ‘non-subject’ shares a number of properties with
S—the subject of an intransitive verb: see below.
C. Linking together S, O, and ‘non-subjects’. All or most languages of the world display a
number of links between S (= subject of an intransitive verb) and O (= object of a transitive
verb) (see Dixon 1994: 55; and Aikhenvald and Dixon forthcoming). These links have nothing
whatever to do with ergativity of any kind. They are expected to be found in languages
with every pattern of syntactic and morphological alignment—that is, nominative/accusative,
absolutive/ergative, and so on. So, if a language marks quantiﬁcation on verbs, it is highly likely
that the number expressed will be that of S or O. And this is indeed the case with the marker of
complete involvement -tu- (see §12.4), e.g. kiya-tu-di (die-many-3plbas.p) ‘TheyS all died’ and
vya-tu-di (kill-many-3plbas.p) ‘They killed (all) of themo (all over the place)’; and not ∗ They
(all) killed them’ (see 12.22–4 and 12.72).
   Besides this expected correlation between S and O, Manambu has a number of less obvious
ones. We saw in §3.3 and then in §10.2.3 that reactivated topic demonstratives can only refer to
an S, or an O, or, somewhat more rarely, to another non-subject participant—for instance,
recipient, location, and time. (That a demonstrative should operate on an absolutive basis
is hardly surprising—in Dyirbal and a few other languages, an NP including a nominal
demonstrative may only occur in S or O function which is the pivot function in Dyirbal: Dixon
2003: 83, 94–9.) These non-subject participants are the ones cross-referenced on the second
position—provided they are topical.
                                                                    20.2 Constituent order        535  This S/O, or, better, non-A, basis for reactivated topic markers has a pragmatic basis. It
agrees with a cross-linguistic tendency for a correlation between the non-A function (typically,
an S/O function) and introducing a new participant (Du Bois 1987). To put it simply: new
participants tend to be introduced in S/O function, but hardly ever in the A function.
  This principle in Manambu has interesting repercussions for the variations in constituent
order, and for the highlighting focus construction. There is a strong preference for non-As to
occur in a postverbal position reserved for unexpected and relatively new information and clar-
iﬁcation (see §20.2). An A constituent hardly ever occurs in highlighting focus constructions
reserved for new information (see §20.3). 20.2 c o n s t i t u e n t o r d e r: i t s s y n tac t i c a n d p rag m at i c m o t i vat i o n sConstituent order in Manambu is predominantly verb ﬁnal in main clauses, and almost exclu-
sively so in dependent clauses (see Tables 19.1 and 20.1). This is consistent with a verb-ﬁnal
tendency advocated as typical of languages with clause chaining and switch-reference.
   However, this is not a steadfast rule. One Sunday in early 2002 Ken Nayau, the major
consultant working with SIL missionaries Robin and Marva Farnsworth, was visiting his native
Avatip. He burst into Yuamali’s house where we were having a mid-afternoon snack to ask me
an urgent question: ‘What is a verb-ﬁnal order?’ I explained, using a mixture of Manambu,
Tok Pisin, and English, what this is supposed to mean (it is not an easy task to say ‘verb’ in
Manambu, or to talk about linguistics in general). ‘You put your verb at the end of what you
say.’ ‘Yes’, replied Ken, ‘this is what Robin told me it means. But we do not speak like that.’
   And indeed, not all clauses in Manambu end with a verb. (In the corpus, about 15–20
per cent do not.) There are a number of principles which allow for non-verb-ﬁnal orders in
the language.
   The general principle of ordering words and constituents in Manambu involves placing new
and less topically established participants ﬁrst. Participants tend to be introduced as O (as can
be seen in T1.1 and T2.1), or in a verbless clause (as in T1.3 which may be translated as ‘(There
was) a young man and a woman’), or as an S of a non-verbal clause (as in T2.3). In a transitive
clause, the order is typically AOV, as in 20.68a. An overt A does not have to be expressed at
all; but it is likelier to be expressed if the predicate is a non-inﬂecting verb as in 20.68a–b (also
see 7.5).20.68a wun m@n-a:m                vi      ma:
       I      you.masc-lk+acc/loc hit+neg neg
       ‘I will not hit you’  An OAV order implies that the O is contrastive, new, and unexpected, as in 20.68b:20.68b m@n-a:m                   wun vi         ma:
       you.masc-lk+acc/loc I           hit+neg neg
       ‘I will not hit you’ (implying that I may hit someone else)  Placing an O before an A is so unusual that if the clause is to be repeated in a ‘head-tail’
bridging structure (see §20.4), the A is also repeated. Note that the O is not case marked,
despite being a personal name: this O is a new participant never mentioned in the story again,
and case marking is associated with topicality—see §7.3.

having hit’ (see §20.4.1). But since there is potential ambiguity as to who did the hitting and
who was hit, ‘Iraman’ is repeated again.
  A fronted O in OAV clauses often appears in a highlighting focus construction:20.70 al@k        [klada                    ta:kw-a]O in focus      [d@ k@-d@

      ‘That is why it is this woman down there (that) he this son of ours may marry’   Obliques also tend to be placed at the beginning of the clause if contrastive—see further
discussion in §20.3.
   The postverbal position is reserved for noun phrases, or sometimes parts thereof, which
provide unexpected supplementary information which is partly new and partly conﬁrms what
we already know. We saw in 20.20 that a numeral can be extracted from a noun phrase
postposed to the verb: in this case it emphasizes the ‘togetherness’ of the action.
   Only a small fraction of such postverbal elements are separated from the verb with a pause,
as one would have expected if it had been an afterthought. Consider 20.16: the woman did not
bring water even for her own child, and this latter, oblique constituent, is postposed to the verb,
as surprising information. This information is not fully new—we already know that the child
accompanied her, and that she did not bother to bring either food or water for either of them.
The postverbal position for the beneﬁciary, the child, stresses how remiss she was.
   Similarly, in 20.6, the speaker reintroduces his ancestor in S function as the one who was
looking around. A similar example is 13.56: the comitative ‘with them’ is supplied after the
verb because it is unexpected, and needs to be reiterated. In T1.16, the S is postposed to
the imperative form since it is conceived as a means of ‘chasing away’ an unexpected guest.
And in T2.16 the tree ﬁnally falls down—this unexpected and surpising result is expressed via
postposing the S to the verb. A similar example is at 20.71—a command by a mother to her
daughter urging her to be less greedy and share some of the tiny Malay apples with her baby
sister:20.71 l@-k@-k      akui                 mugul-a-jagw@s

the postverbal noun phrase contains a relative clause). We already know where the mother and
her brother had gone; that the child decides to follow them right there is unexpected.
20.72 kwap@k ada                              ya:d               [amæy wa
      next.day dem.dist.react.top+masc.sg go+3masc.sgbas.p mother and
      away              yi-bra           tamiya:k]
      mother’s.brother go-3dubas.p+lk area+lk+dat
      ‘Next day he (child) went (guess where) to the area where mother and uncle had gone’
   As a result of this unexpected turn of events, the child discovers the existence of yams—
this is the beginning of the story about the origin of yams. A similar example is at T3.26—the
snake’s entering the house (postposed to the verb) is unexpected: snakes are not supposed to
enter houses.
   Alternatively, a postverbal NP may provide additional clariﬁcation, as in 20.8: the speaker
wanted to make sure the audience understands exactly who went up the river. A similar
example is at 20.73: the postverbal oblique makes it clear that the speaker is urging his sister to
return to the house:
20.73 s@b@n@n      yi-t@k         wiya:r
      return+seq go-1duimpv house+lk+all
      ‘Let’s go back, (that is) home’
  When a little boy got drowned in the village, the whole family was involved in mourning him;
20.74a speciﬁes that his mother was also among those who cried at that time:
20.74a [ata wuk@-ku]        [gra-dian    d@-k@            amæy wuk@n]
       then hear-compl.ss cry-1plbas.p he-obl+3fem.sg mother with
       ‘Then having heard (the news) we cried together with his mother’
   Similarly, in T2.59 the possessor in a non-verbal possessive clause is postposed to the
predicate, as a means of clariﬁcation. An NP which provides clariﬁcation is more likely to
be separated from the rest of the clause with a pause than an NP which supplies unexpected
information. An example of a clarifying afterthought is at T3.41.
   Not every syntactic function allows for a postverbal position with equal ease. The number
of transitive subjects in this position is remarkably limited. One such rare example is at 20.74b.
The participant sucking the breast was—according to the speaker—a rather unexpected one:
20.74b a                 ta:kw m@ñ ka:d                    a-d@        wa:j
       dem.dist.fem.sg woman breast eat+3masc.sgbas.p dem.dist-masc.sg eel
       ‘That eel (guess who!) was sucking that woman’s breast’
Another example is in the last clause of 16.29. This is an example of clariﬁcation stating exactly
which members of the opposite clan group (that is, the wife’s relatives) were conducting a
debate about the man’s mortuary festival.
   Two noun phrases can be postposed to the verb, albeit rarely. In 20.75a two NPs (an oblique
and an S) clarify a statement which would otherwise have appeared obscure. The adverb
‘already’ is also postposed to the verb—this emphasizes the unexpectedness of the fact that
the plane (and Jager with it) is already going away, in the direction of Wewak:
20.75a væki-na-d                           b@        Wewak-a:r          Jag@r
       go.across-act.foc-3masc.sgbas.vt already Wewak-lk+all Jager
       ‘Jager is already going across to Wewak!’ (lit. (He) is already (surprise!) going across to
       Wewak Jager)
538     20 Clause Types and Discourse-Pragmatic Devices   The English translation presents this clause as if it contained afterthoughts—the Manambu
clause does not, because there are no pauses intervening between the constituents.
   A rare example of VOA order is at 20.75b: that I (the addressee) had not yet had the chance
to go to the market and see Walinum (‘her’) again was surprising to the speaker:
20.75b ma: n@bay v@          l@-k@-m             ñ@n
       neg yet     see+neg she-obl-acc/loc you.fem
       ‘You (not anyone else: surprise) haven’t yet seen (guess who) her’
  An unusual constituent order, such as OVAO in 20.76, tends to involve repetition of one of
the constituents. In 20.76, bal ‘pig’ (O) is repeated twice: once before and once after the verb:
20.76 [abra                  {war-b@r]        [war-ku]}       [balO
      dem.dist.react.top+du go.up-3dubas.p go.up-compl.ss pig
      ada                         vya-bra-d]                    [amæy asa:y]A
      dem.dist.react.top+masc.sg kill-3dusubj.p-3masc.sgbas.p mother father
      [p@takaum kwa-d-@                   bal]O
      ladder+loc stay-3masc.sgbas.vt-lk pig
      ‘The two went up, having gone up; killed the pig mother (and) father the pig that was
      on the ladder’
  The second postposed constituent can be an afterthought, as in 20.77. It is separated from
the rest of the clause by a pause:
20.77 [a-d@             wi     ada                          yi:n
      dem.dist-masc.sg house dem.dist.react.top+masc.sg go+seq
      s@maka-yi-d@-d                         du-a-ñan]     pause [a-di        rum-a:b]
      show-go-3masc.sgsubj.p-3masc.sgbas.p man-lk-child pause dem.dist-pl room-too
      ‘The boy (guess who) kept on showing that house on and on, those rooms too’
   Speakers vary as to the frequency of postposed NPs and adverbs. Postposition for clariﬁ-
cation purposes is more frequent with older women as story tellers, accustomed to explaining
and spelling out things for their grandchildren as their audience. During my ﬁrst stay at Avatip,
speakers such as Yipawal, Yuawalup, and the late Wimali would use such postposed noun
phrases (S, O, obliques, and even As) with much more frequency than later on, after I’d become
much less of a novice (or a novelty), and was expected to understand a story like any other
adult.
   Postposing an NP to the verb in a command may have additional repercussions to do with
its illocutionary force. This is shown in the three contrasting examples below. In 20.78a, the
mother tells the elder child to give a doll to a younger child who is crying:
20.78a dolly nak l@-k@-k     akui
       dolly one she-obl-dat impv+give.to.third.p
       ‘Give her one dolly!’
  The elder girl ignores the command, and the younger child continues crying. The mother,
mildly annoyed, repeats the command as 20.78b:
20.78b dolly nak akui                     l@-k@-k
       dolly one impv+give.to.third.p she-obl-dat
       ‘Give her one dolly’ (lit. one dolly give to her)
  The girl ignores it again, and the younger child cries more and more. The mother shouts:
                                                                  20.2 Constituent order        53920.78c akui                   pause dolly nak l@-k@-k
       impv+give.to.third.p pause dolly one she-obl-dat
       ‘Give her one dolly!!!’ (Give (pause) one dolly to her)
  In this last example, the noun phrases are separated from the verb with a short pause.
However, it appears counterintuitive to treat them as ‘afterthoughts’—rather, the mother sets
the NPs oﬀ from the verb as a way of reminding the naughty girl what she is to do, unless she
wants to face the consequences. (The child did not, and opted to run away.)
  Order within dependent clauses tends to be verb ﬁnal. However, there are exceptions—as in
T1.3, and 20.79. These exceptions serve a didactic purpose—that of reminding the audience of
an S, or an O, or an oblique (but hardly ever an A). The man was mentioned a few lines before;
so the speaker chose to repeat a reference to him, just in case:
20.79 [v@-k@tak@p t@-ku              du-a:k]         [adiya          s@b@nadi]
      see-fr       ‘stand’-compl.ss man-lk+dat dem.dist.react.top+pl return+3plbas.p
      ‘Having tried to see the man in vain, they returned’
There is never any pause between the predicate of the dependent clause and the postposed NP.
   A dependent clause can be postposed to the main clause, as a means of providing supplemen-
tary information, as in 14.115, 14.116, and T1.34. This information is not new—the function of
a postposed dependent clause is to remind the listener of something they are already supposed
to know. Consider T1.34: all the postposed medial completive clause tells us is that the main
character was married—something we have known from the very start of the story.
   A similar example is at 20.80. The girl is very angry with her uncle who had mistreated her
in the past. This is what the preceding paragraph is about. The uncle understands this and says
to the girl’s brother (for whom the fact that the girl is angry is also no news):
20.80 [l@ [l@-k@             s@    kwa:l-a                 tamiya:b] kwa:l
      she she-obl+fem.sg sleep stay+3fem.sgbas.p-lk area+lk+term stay+3fem.sgbas.p
      aka]                         [wun-a:k warsama-ku]
      dem.dist.react.top.fem.sg I-lk+dat be.angry-compl.ss
      ‘She is in the place where she sleeps, having got angry at me’
   A dependent medial clause postposed to the main clause with same-subject marking may
have a recapitulative function. Then they form one intonation unit. Examples are in 18.19 and
18.28, 20.76, T2.23, and the penultimate clause of T2.40. We saw, in §19.5, that such recapit-
ulating constructions are particularly frequent in speech reports, as in 19.74. An additional
function of this is to stress that a speech act actually took place: speech report constructions
in Manambu are used in a wide variety of meanings not all of which involve a speech act.
Alternatively, the same-subject form of the verb t@- ‘stand, be’ can be used in the meaning of
‘after that’, literally, ‘having been (like that)’, as in 18.24 and 18.28, and T2.62.
   We saw in §13.7, and especially examples such as 13.79–81 and 20.64, that a dative-aversive
marked nominalization can precede or follow the main (inﬂected) verb. A postverbal position
is reserved for an unexpected piece of information, as in 13.82 (people are normally not afraid
of going into a house).
   The position of the reactivated topic demonstrative aka (dem.dist.react.top.fem.sg) before
or after the verb depends on what the demonstrative refers to. If it refers to a participant
(typically in S, O or oblique function), it precedes the verb, as in 10.41 and T2.1. If it refers to
the action itself, it can be placed either before or after the verb.
   It appears after the verb if the whole action and its extent is somewhat unexpected. Consider
the ﬁnal lines of the three texts: in T2.69, aka precedes the verb, and in T1.35 and T3.53 it
540      20 Clause Types and Discourse-Pragmatic Devicesfollows. In the latter instances, the end of a story is stated as being ‘that topical one’: neither
story is a traditional one, and consequently does not have an ending that everyone would be
aware of. In contrast, T2.69 is the ending of a traditional story which ﬁnishes in due course;
and so aka precedes the verb. Along similar lines, in the ﬁrst clause in 20.80 the fact that the
girl is sleeping in her house and her uncle is left outside is somewhat unexpected and contrary
to convention—this explains the postverbal position of aka.
   In summary: constituent order in Manambu is both syntactically and pragmatically based.
In particular, the fact that A (transitive subject) hardly ever appears postposed to the verb
reﬂects its pragmatic function closely associated with its syntactic role.
   We will see, in §20.4.1 (example 20.90) that having a non-verb-ﬁnal constituent order does
not aﬀect the basics of ‘head-tail’ linkage between sentences.
                    20.3 highlighting fo cus constructionsHighlighting focus constructions (mentioned in §3.1 and then in §11.1.1, and example 11.8)
involve marking a noun phrase or a fully inﬂected verb as if it were a non-verbal predicate,
in order to contrast it with another constituent, or another clause. A noun phrase or a
verbal form in highlighting focus takes nominal cross-referencing enclitics. Gender and number
speciﬁcations agree with the head of predicate. That is, if the predicate head is masculine
singular, as in the ﬁrst clause in 20.81, cross-referencing is masculine singular. And if the
predicate head is feminine singular, so is the cross-referencing, as in the second clause in
20.81. If the whole inﬂected verb is in highlighting focus (examples 20.87–8), the agreement
is third person feminine singular; this is in line with this being the least functionally marked
choice. Highlighting focus constructions are highly frequent in conversations and narratives.
They involve contrasting a constituent to another constituent; or ‘stressing’ a constituent as
important for the discourse.
   As mentioned in §20.1.1, parts of a noun phrase cannot be focused independently: only an
NP as a whole can. The same principle applies to complex predicates. A clause cannot contain
two constituents each in a focus construction. A constituent in focus tends to occupy a clause-
initial position.
   A highlighting focus construction does not appear to produce a cleft sentence: the non-
focused part of the clause has the make-up of an independent clause. We would expect a cleft
to split a clause into two clauses: one copula-like, and the other marked as a relative clause (see
Matthews 1997). We return to this issue further below.
   There is no intonation break or pause between the form in highlighting focus, which has to
obligatorily precede the predicate. A story or a conversation never starts with a highlighting
focus simply because a highlighting focus implies contrast to something previously mentioned.
A constituent in highlighting focus does not have to be deﬁnite; but it has to have been
mentioned previously in discourse.
   Highlighting focus overwhelmingly involves S (intransitive subject), as in T1.3, T1.13,
penultimate clause of T3.16, T3.25, and 20.81, or the object, as in T2.59, T3.3, and 20.82.
Constituents in highlighting focus are in braces, and so are their translations into English:20.81 [{j@pwas-ad}               t@k@r-@m     r@-kwa-na-d]

                                                      20.3 Highlighting focus constructions    541       ‘{An initiated man} used to sit on a stool, {as for a woman}, there is no sitting on a
       stool’ (lit. {It is an initiated man} used to sit on a stool,{it is a woman} there is no
       sitting on a stool)
  An object in highlighting focus construction is never case marked. This is in line with
the semantics of object case marking (see §7.3): only deﬁnite and topical, rather than focal,
objects are case marked. This also agrees with a general tendency of not having case-marked
constituents in the highlighting focus constructions.
20.82 {du d@-k@-d@           kui-ad}      k@-da-d
      man he-obl-masc.sg meat-3masc.sgnom eat-3plsubj.p-3masc.sgbas.p
      ‘{It is man’s ﬂesh} they ate’
  The S of a non-verbal clause can be in highlighting focus, as in T1.7 (‘as for this one’), T2.27
(ka ‘this is it (that I am)’), T3.40 (kad b@ numa-d@ ga:n-ad ‘this is that it is a big masculine
night’) and 20.83.
20.83 {a-d@                 masalay-ad}            kabay-ad
      dem.dist-masc.sg spirit-3masc.sgnom snake-3masc.sgnom
      ‘{It is that spirit} (who) is a snake’ (lit. {It is a spirit} is a snake)
So can a time adverb as in T3.42 (‘today’), and an addressee, as in 20.84.
20.84 {a-d@               Kainu-ad}              wa-ñ@na-d
      dem.dist-masc.sg Kainu-3masc.sgnom say-2fem.sgsubj.p-3masc.sgbas.p
      ‘{It is that Kainu} (that) you spoke to’ (lit. {it is that Kainu} you spoke to)
If a location or an instrument is focused, it tends to appear without any case marking, as in
20.85a (this is also a possible alternative interpretation for the ﬁrst clause of T2.8). A rare
example of a case-marked oblique in highlighting focus is at 20.85b.
20.85a {gu-a}               ya-b@r
       water-3fem.sgnom come-3dubas.p
       ‘{It is to water} (that) they came’
20.85b wiyar-a                         yi-na-di
       house+lk+all-3fem.sgnom go-act.foc-3plbas.vt
       ‘{It is to the house} (that) they went’
   We mentioned in §10.2.2 that ata ‘thus’ has a predicative focus form ata-n, e.g. ata-n au (thus-
pred impv+talk) ‘speak now’ (lit. ‘it is now that you are commanded to speak’). This marker
also appears when ata heads the predicate (see §20.1.3). An example of ata in a highlighting
focus construction is at 20.86 (the O, ‘ceremony’, is postposed to the verb as a clariﬁcation).
20.86 {ata-n-adi}         t@-da-di              ba:gw
      thus-pred-3plnom have-3plsubj.p-3plbas.p ceremony
      ‘{This was the way} they had ceremonies’ (lit. {Thus was} they had (what we already
      know, that is) ceremonies)
  A constituent within a dependent clause can rarely occur in a highlighting focus construction
unless there is a break (a rare example is at T2.35). A dependent clause (except for an -n-marked
sequential clause) cannot be in highlighting focus.
542     20 Clause Types and Discourse-Pragmatic Devices   We saw, at §20.1.3 above, that the interrogative pronoun s@ ‘who’ is obligatorily marked for
focus if it occurs in subject function. This is the only instance of grammaticalized focus whose
occurrence is limited to S and A.
   Highlighting focus constructions involving arguments and obliques cannot be negated sep-
arately. This is hardly surprising: we can recall that a constituent cannot be negated separately,
without the whole clause being negated.
   We now turn to a rather unusual construction whose function is to contrast an action, or
a state, to other actions or states. Such ‘predicate focus’ constructions involve marking a fully
inﬂected verb as if it were a non-verbal predicate. Note that they cannot involve a predicate
already marked for action focus (§12.2). (If the predicate in ‘predicate focus’ contains an
uninﬂected verb, it requires a support verb—see §17.2.) In 20.87, the speaker is saying that
what they were going to do was to cut the pig, and not anything else. This is framed as predicate
focus—that is, the whole clause is within the scope of the focus. A similar example is at 11.8.
20.87 [au {k@-d@                 bal ra-k@-bana-l}-a]
      then dem.prox-masc.sg pig cut-fut-1plsubj.vt-3fem.sgbas.vt-3fem.sgnom
      ‘It is that {we are going to cut the pig}’ (rather than doing something else)
  ‘Predicate focus’ structures produced spontaneously often provide an explanation for an
unusual event or state. When we returned to Avatip from an exhausting trip to Swakap, people
would look askance at my bandaged arms. The answer—provided by Yuaneng—was:
20.88 [{Swakapa:r         yi-ba-l}-a]
      Swakap+lk+all go-1plsubj.p-3fem.sgbas.p-3fem.sgnom
      ‘It is that {we went to Swakap}’ (and got sunburnt and tired)
   A distal demonstrative as head of non-verbal predicate can be put in a focus construction,
as a form of a strong statement: a-l-al (dem.dist.fem.sg-3fem.sgnom-3fem.sgnom) ‘this is it’.
It is also used as a conversation sustainer, and as a summarizing statement indicating that the
speaker has ﬁnished one point, and may well start on something else.
   Such predicate focus constructions cannot contain reactivated topic demonstratives. Neither
do they occur with a non-predicate-ﬁnal constituent order. This is to do with their pragmatic
organization: the event or the resulting state is viewed as a whole, and is thus contrasted to
another event, the participants being of secondary importance.
   The diﬀerence between the English translational equivalents in 20.87–8 and 11.8 and the
Manambu structures is that there is no overt subordination marker in Manambu.
   If the predicate in a highlighting focus construction is negated, it takes the subordinate
negator -ma:r-. We can recall, from §14.5.3, that this is indeed the most frequent context under
which a predicate of what looks like an independent clause may occur with -ma:r-. This involves
focusing a negated clause. Examples are at 14.134–5, and 20.89a. What makes life in Swakap
unbearable for the people from Avatip and Malu is that:
20.89a [{kwasa          wi    t@-ma:r-dana-l}-a]
       small+fem.sg house have-neg.sub-3plsubj.vt-3fem.sgbas.vt-3fem.sgnom
       ‘It is that {they do not have toilet (small house)}’
   This brings us back to the issue of whether highlighting focus involves a cleft or not. In
many languages, focus constructions are expressed via cleft clauses which, in their turn, involve
marking part of a clause as a dependent clause. That a dependent clause negator is used
in focused clauses shows that such clauses may be considered underlyingly dependent. That
is, at least predicate focus constructions may be considered clefted, but the evidence only
                                            20.4 Further issues in discourse organization       543becomes apparent if they are negated. And this should not come as a surpise—it is also the
case in relative and juxtaposed dependent clauses whose status as dependent clauses is fully
revealed under negation. Highlighting focus constructions do not involve relative clauses (see
§19.2): the rearrangement of participants typical for possessor relative clauses does not occur
in highlighting focus constructions.
   If a constituent in highlighting focus is contrastive, an option is to employ double focus. This
involves adding another nominal cross-referencing marker, as in 20.89b. Here, the fact that they
do not have a toilet is contrasted to the fact that other, more ‘cultured’ people do:20.89b [{kwasa          wi
       small+fem.sg house
       t@-ma:r-dana-l}-a]-al
       have-neg.sub-3plsubj.vt-3fem.sgbas.vt-3fem.sgnom-3fem.sgnom
       ‘It is that {they do not really have toilet (small house)}’   The existence of double focus structures demonstrates that focus constructions are diﬀerent
from verbless clauses with non-verbal predicate heads: no non-verbal predicate would take
double cross-referencing, outside the focus construction. Unlike 20.60, where a double focus
structure is obligatory, in 20.89b it is pragmatically determined.
   Are highlighting focus constructions monoclausal or biclausal? The evidence goes both
ways. A noun phrase in highlighting focus has the appearance of a full verbless clause, since
it includes non-verbal cross-referencing markers. On the other hand, it is not a full clause
because it cannot be negated separately. It occupies the argument slot of the predicate. And
if it is to be questioned, the question word also has to be cast as a focused constituent.
We conclude that highlighting focus constructions combine features of biclausal and mono-
clausal constructions, and, just like transitivity-neutralizing constructions involving clause
chaining (§17.5), are an additional instance of grammar-in-the-making. A similar construction
in Iatmul was described by Jendraschek (2006b): their status as bi- or monoclausal is equally
ambiguous.
               20.4 f u rt h e r i s s u e s i n d i s c o u r s e o rga n i zat i o nManambu clauses form sentences which contain one main clause, and sentences combine to
form a paragraph. A paragraph—or a coherent stretch of discourse—is deﬁned as having a
topic of its own, and is normally separated from the next paragraph by a signiﬁcant pause.
As we saw above, a topic usually appears preposed to the predicate. A reactivated topic—
that is, a topic mentioned in a previous stretch of discourse and known to the speaker
and to the addressee, but not mentioned for some time—is marked with reactivated topic
demonstratives (see §10.2.3 and §3.3). This is a powerful device which allows speakers to
handle more than one topic at a time. The ways sentences can be linked together within a
paragraph, or across paragraphs, are addressed in §20.4.1. In §20.4.2 we discuss the function
of ‘boundary-marking’ clauses consisting of ya:kya ‘all right’ and its Tok Pisin equivalent orait
(§20.4.2).
   We saw in §20.2 above that constituent order plays its role in identiﬁcation of topical partic-
ipants. Narratives tend to be elaborate in stating participants, while conversational discourse
is highly elliptical, and heavily relies on context. Some of the recurrent principles of ellipsis in
the Manambu discourse are discussed in §20.4.3.
544      20 Clause Types and Discourse-Pragmatic Devices   A typical turn-taking device is the ﬁrst person permissive form of the verb wa- ‘speak’: wau
‘May I speak? Shall I speak now?’ A distal demonstrative as head of non-verbal predicate in a
focus construction a-l-al (dem.dist.fem.sg-3fem.sgnom-3fem.sgnom) ‘this is it’ signals the end
of what someone has to say, indicating that at least one point is ﬁnished, just like a verbless
clause akatawa ‘this is how it is’ (see 20.53a).
   Expressions like a-l-al and the interjection ay are used as conversation sustainers, supplying
feedback from the listener and urging the speaker to go on talking. The expression ma:j ma:
(speech neg) ‘there is nothing to say; talk is over’ (very similar to Tok Pisin nogat tok) is a
signal that there is nothing much else to add to the conversation.","[558, 559, 560, 561, 562, 563, 564, 565, 566, 567, 568, 569, 570, 571]"

        1        Introduction: The Language and its Speakers
Manambu belongs to the Ndu language family, and is spoken by about 2,500 people in
ﬁve villages: Avatip, Yawabak, Malu, Apa:n, and Yambon (Yuanab) in East Sepik Province,
Ambunti district. About 200–400 speakers live in the cities of Port Moresby, Wewak, Lae, and
Madang; a few people live in Kokopo and Mount Hagen.                                   1.1 l i n g u i s t i c ty p eManambu is synthetic, with elements of fusion, and predominantly suﬃxing. The imperative
marker a- is the only fully productive preﬁx (§13.2.1), while the causative-manipulative preﬁx
kay- occurs with a limited number of verbs (§16.2.1). The inﬁx -ka- marks intensive forms of
non-agreeing adjectives (§4.3).
   Manambu has twenty consonants and nine vowels. There is a series of simple voiced and
voiceless bilabial, apico-dental, and dorso-velar stops (just like in other Ndu languages). Voiced
and voiceless bilabial and dorso-velar stops also have a labialized counterpart. All the voiced
stops and the voiced fricative j are prenasalized in word-initial, intervocalic, and word-ﬁnal
positions. Vowel length is contrastive. Long vowels a: and æ: are a recent innovation: older
speakers still pronounce these as sequences of identical short vowels interrupted by a glottal
stop. Syllable structure is (C)(C)V(C). Stress is movable and contrastive. Long vowels tend to
be stressed (Chapter 2).
   Open classes are nouns and verbs. Nominal categories include case, three numbers, and two
genders in the singular. Grammatical relations are expressed with verbal cross-referencing and
with nominal case marking. Manambu has nine case forms, more than any other Ndu lan-
guage. The subject case is formally unmarked. The same form marks locative and a deﬁnite and
fully involved object. Another form expresses direction and instrument. The dative case marks
beneﬁciary and maleﬁciary, and also has an aversive meaning, ‘for fear of’. The terminative
case means ‘on the very edge of’, and ‘up until’. Two cases mark ‘means of transportation’.
The substitutive case means ‘instead of’. The comitative case meaning ‘together with’ is
a major device for coordinating noun phrases. Its additional meanings are locative ‘along
(e.g. a road)’ and temporal ‘while’. Case markers may attach to verbal roots: the objective-
locative case marks completive aspect, dative case marks purpose, instrumental case derives
deverbal adverbs, and substitutive case marks dependent clauses meaning ‘instead of doing
something’.
   Verbal categories include personal cross-referencing fused with tense, aspect, mood
(imperative-permissive, and irrealis), and modalities (optative, purposive, desiderative, and two
frustratives). The subject (A/S) is always cross-referenced on the verb. A second argument—
direct object, beneﬁciary, location, time, manner, or instrument—can be cross-referenced if
it is more topical than the subject. A copula complement, a speech report, and a comita-
tive constituent are never cross-referenced. Members of word classes other than verbs take
2     1 Introductioncross-referencing enclitics when they occupy the predicate slot (Chapters 3–4). This is unlike
most other Ndu languages which cross-reference only the subject.
   A small closed class of agreeing adjectives has three members, ‘big’, ‘small’, and ‘ﬁne’; these
agree in gender and number with the head noun. About sixteen non-agreeing adjectives—
which cover semantic types such as value, dimension, colour, and age—share a number of
properties with nouns. Adverbs and time words are semi-closed classes which share a few
properties with nouns. Word class-changing derivations are limited.
   A striking property of Manambu is its gender system. Two genders, masculine and feminine,
are assigned to nouns according to their referents’ sex and also shape and size. That is, a
large house is masculine, and a small house feminine. Genders are covert in the sense that,
rather than being marked on the noun itself, they appear on the agreeing modiﬁers, verbs,
and adverbial demonstratives, and in possessive constructions. The feminine gender is both
formally and functionally unmarked (Chapter 5).
   Three numbers—singular, dual, and plural—are marked on the agreeing modiﬁers, verbs,
and in possessive constructions. Plural and dual are marked on most kinship terms and on
a few nouns with a human referent. Associative non-singular (X and his/her associates) is
restricted to just personal names (Chapter 6). The choice between ﬁve types of possessive
construction depends on the type of possessive relationship, of possessee, and of possessor
(Chapter 8).
   The system of demonstratives is unusually intricate. Three demonstrative roots, k@-
‘proximate demonstrative: near speaker’, wa- ‘proximate demonstrative: near addressee’, and
a- ‘distal demonstrative’, are used in nominal demonstratives, in manner adverbial demonstra-
tives, and in reactivated topic demonstratives. Nominal demonstratives express either spatio-
temporal deixis or ‘current relevance’. The latter are derived from the former with the suﬃx
-na- ‘current relevance’, indicating that the object of pointing is being talked about, or is of
immediate or ongoing importance to the speakers. Spatio-temporal demonstratives distinguish
gender and number, and may also distinguish either three additional degrees of distance, or
ﬁve directions. ‘Current relevance’ demonstratives distinguish ﬁve directions, and two addi-
tional degrees of distance, but no number or gender. Reactivated topic demonstratives refer
predominantly to an S/O constituent (Chapter 10).
   Negation is marked diﬀerently depending on aspect, tense, mood, and modality. Non-
habitual negative indicative clauses have no person marking. All dependent clauses are negated
diﬀerently from main clauses. Three prohibitives diﬀer in their illocutionary force.
   Manambu has a productive system of verbal compounds (they can be alternatively analysed
as one-word serial verbs: Chapter 15). They express manner, aspectual and sequential mean-
ings, and function as valency-changing devices. Many are lexicalized and have idiomatic
meanings.
   Verbs divide into several subclasses depending on whether they can occur with directional
markers, and which directional markers they occur with. Inherently directional verbs
include the six basic verbs war- ‘go upwards’, da- ‘go downwards’, væki- ‘go across (away from
the speaker)’, væra- ‘go across (towards speaker)’, wula- ‘enter, come in, come in a direction
from the Sepik River’, and waku- ‘go out (including motion in direction away from the Sepik
River)’. These do not take any further directional speciﬁcations. Their roots are the base
for directional markers on other verbs, and on demonstratives. Intrinsically directional
verbs include four roots which must take directional suﬃxes, each of which corresponds
to an inherently directional verb. The majority of verbs are optionally directional. They
combine with bound forms consisting of s@- followed by a directional marker. Copula verbs,
                                                                         1.1 Linguistic type      3the general motion verbs yi- ‘go’ and ya- ‘come’, and ingestive and stative verbs do not combine
with any directionals. Directionals also have a valency-increasing eﬀect. Directionals on verbs
and on demonstratives have similar origins, but display subtle diﬀerences in their semantics
(Chapter 16).
   Manambu has a semi-productive causative-manipulative preﬁx kay- which causativizes a
limited set of intransitive verbs. When applied to transitive verbs, it indicates a special physical
eﬀort and the intensity of action. There is no passive. Instead, Manambu employs transitivity-
neutralizing constructions which involve clause chaining, and are ambiguous as to their status
as biclausal or as monoclausal. A reciprocal marker awarwa has an associative meaning
‘together with’. Reﬂexive meanings are expressed with a variety of means none of which
involves a verbal derivation (§16.2).
   Ten polyfunctional verbs can each be used as an auxiliary or as a support verb, and also
as a copula verb (Table 4.1, and Chapter 17). Auxiliary verb constructions express aspectual,
positional, and modal meanings. There are also a variety of idiomatic complex predicates. Body
part constructions—expressing emotional, mental, and physical states—are a special subtype
thereof.
   Clause linking in Manambu is achieved through a variety of means. The major strategy is
clause chaining via medial dependent clauses. In most cases this involves switch-reference (that
is, marking of dependent clauses may be sensitive to whether their subject (A/S) is the same as
that of the following clause or not). The tense and extent of action expressed in a medial clause
is determined by its relationship to the action of a subsequent dependent clause or a main
clause. There are also causal clauses, and ‘unlikely condition’ clauses. Other clause-linking
devices include juxtaposition of a dependent clause and a main clause (this is a preferred
manner of indicating conditional meanings); clause linking via a case marker ‘instead’ and
a suﬃx ‘like’, and clause linking involving connectives.
   Relative clauses are similar to main clauses in most properties; they are negated like depen-
dent clauses. Speech reports—direct, indirect, and ‘semi-direct’—are highly frequent. They
express a wide variety of meanings, including desire, fear, and reason. Manambu has no
complement clauses as a special clause type; instead, medial and other dependent clauses are
co-opted as complementation strategies (Chapters 18 and 19).
   Constituent order in Manambu tends to be verb ﬁnal. It is often motivated by discourse
pragmatics. Word order within constituents depends on their type. For instance, quantiﬁers
can precede the noun head or follow it depending on the referent’s topicality. Chapter 20
oﬀers a comprehensive analysis of the principles of ordering words and constituents, and also
of the structure of constituents, and of clauses. An argument, or the predicate, can occur
in a highlighting focus construction. A focused constituent appears marked as a non-verbal
predicate head with the appropriate person markers, and the rest of the clause remains as it
was. Highlighting focus constructions may appear biclausal. A focused noun phrase has the
makings of a full verbless clause, since it contains the non-verbal cross-referencing markers.
However, it is not a full clause because it cannot be negated separately. Highlighting focus
constructions are an instance of grammar-in-the-making, similar to transitivity-neutralizing
constructions involving clause chaining (§19.9 and §20.3).
   Manambu has a highly elaborate verbal and nominal lexicon. Typologically unusual seman-
tic groups of verbs cover eating, drinking, and chewing, perception, and speech. Highly speciﬁc
terms coexist with highly generalized ones. A general noun ma:gw ‘whatever, whatchamacallit’
and a general verb m@gi- ‘do whatever’ are an option, if one cannot think of the right term, or
prefers to be non-speciﬁc. In the Manambu tradition, knowledge—tantamount to monetary
4      1 Introductionriches—is viewed in terms of lexicon, especially the totemic names (which are nouns). The
issue of name ownership acquires particular importance at name debates (saki). Multiple
‘names’—each belonging to a diﬀerent clan—result in multiple synonymy. The totemic names
are used as address terms, as an integral part of Manambu speech etiquette, where the tradi-
tional patterns coexist with newly acquired Western imports.
   In terms of the etymological make-up of its lexicon and grammar, Manambu is a central
member of the Ndu family. There are a number of loans from other languages of the area,
mostly Western Iatmul. Similarities between Manambu and the neighbouring Kwoma are
contact induced. All the speakers of Manambu are proﬁcient in Tok Pisin and many also
in English, and code-switching is pervasive. Signs of incipient language obsolescence look
ominous—however, a strong opposition to language loss gives room to hope that the language
will live.
                     1.2 t he manambu: t h e p r e s e n t a n d t h e pa s tThe Manambu occupy ﬁve villages in the Ambunti District in the East Sepik Province
of Papua New Guinea (see Map). They live mostly on the Sepik River (Manambu ñab,
cf. Kwoma nabagey 1 ), and more precisely, on its section between the Hunstein Mountain range
and the Washkuk Hills. Avatip is the major village in terms of population, of physical size, of
ceremonial signiﬁcance, and of military exploits. We return to this in §1.2.2 and §1.4.
   The Manambu and the neighbouring Kwoma have been fortunate, in terms of attracting
high-quality anthropological research. Useful and highly informative accounts of the Man-
ambu culture in Newton (1971), Bragge (1990), and especially Harrison (1983, 1985a–b, 1987,
1990a–b, 1993) contain anthropological analysis and innumerable insights into the cultural
and cognitive patterns of Manambu ritual and everyday life over the years. This is why this and
the following sections are limited to a very brief sketch of cultural background, with just the
information necessary for understanding the grammar which follows.","[25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31]"

  Alternatively, a spatio-temporal demonstrative can be preceded by the distal demonstrative
in its anaphoric function, or if it is used to mark a previously mentioned deﬁnite referent.
An example is a-d@ k@-d@ t@ p (dem.dist-masc.sg dem.prox-masc.sg village) ‘deﬁnite/previously
mentioned this-proximate village’—literally, ‘that this village’, used to refer to the Avatip village
which has just been discussed in detail. That is, demonstratives in their diﬀerent meanings
complement each other. No other demonstratives can occur together in one noun phrase.
   We will now look at further features of noun phrases. We start with (A) appositional
noun phrases (where a noun modiﬁes another noun), and then address (B) headship of a
noun phrase, (C) noun phrase coordination and disjunction, and (D) the order, and types,
of modiﬁers in noun phrases. Further problems in deﬁning the boundaries of noun phrases are
discussed in (E).
A. Appositional noun phrases. A head noun can be modiﬁed by another noun which then
takes a linker (most often -a-: see §4.1.1), as in apawul-a du (evil.spirit-lk man) ‘male evil
spirit’. The head noun itself can consist of a compound—see §9.3. Or it can consist of two
nouns in apposition to each other. Appositional constructions are of four types. The order of
components is ﬁxed in types A.I–III.
A.Ia. A kinship term followed by a personal name, as in 20.2. Note the absence of the linker
on the ﬁrst noun.
20.2 Lumawad@m [d@-k@-d@           k@-d@             ñamus        Kainuwa:k]
     Lumawandem he-obl-masc.sg dem.prox-masc.sg younger.sibling Kainu+lk+dat
     ata wa-d@-d
     then say-3masc.sgsubj.p-3masc.sgbas.p
     ‘Lumawandem then said to Kainu, this younger brother of his’
   A kinship term can be followed by the name of a kind of animal or reptile, as in amæy karaki
(mother death.adder) ‘death adder the mother’ throughout Text 3 and ñan kabay (child snake)
‘snake the child’ in T3.8 (also see amæy m@d ‘mother cassowary’ and ñan m@d ‘child cassowary’
in 20.9). A name of an animal can be followed by a kinship term, and then a noun phrase can
have two readings: m@d amæy may mean ‘cassowary’s mother’ or ‘mother cassowary’. The two
readings can be diﬀerentiated only by context.
                                                                 20.1 Major constituents          509  A pronoun can also be followed by a personal name, as in wun Walinum ‘me Walinum’ and
20.11 (which contains three appositional NPs similar to those in 20.2).
A.Ib. Additional meanings of kinship terms asa:y ‘father’ and amæy ‘mother’ in apposi-
tional noun phrases. These have somewhat idiosyncratic meanings. We can recall, from §5.3
and 5.14, that the noun asa:y ‘father’ can be used with or without the adjective ‘big’ as a kind
of augmentative, e.g. numa-d@ asa:y wuk (big-masc.sg father tooth) ‘very big tooth’, or simply
asa:y wuk ‘very big tooth’. The noun amæy is also used as a kind of augmentative in amæy ta:b
(mother hand) ‘thumb’. The combination amæy ta:kw (mother wife) refers to the ﬁrst, elder
wife (the term for non-ﬁrst wife is g@ña ta:kw ‘last+lk wife’ (or tail+lk wife), as in T2.50).
A.II. A name of an object (typically, a ritually important one) followed by the word denoting
this object, e.g. Mak@mawi n@b@k ‘Makemawi mountain’ (Manambu name for Ambunti moun-
tain), K@b@nwali kara:b ‘men’s house called Kebenwali’. The ﬁrst noun takes the linker (see
§4.1.1), e.g. Pakan@bra kara:b (Pakaneber+lk men’s.house) ‘men’s house called Pakaneber’,
Waikab-@ kara:b ‘men’s house called Waikab’.
A.III. An appositional construction denoting extension of class consists of a noun followed by
the generic m@wi ‘things like that’. This generic noun is not used anywhere else in the language
(and cannot occur on its own). It is semantically comparable to the associative non-singular
discussed at §6.2.2. And the two are in complementary distribution: we can recall that the
associative non-singular can only be formed on personal names, e.g. Nelma-b@r (Nelma-ass)
‘Nelma and others associated with her’ (6.29). The generic noun m@wi can be used with any
noun, except personal names, deﬁnite nouns, and nouns with a uniquely identiﬁable referent.
A noun phrase containing m@wi is indeﬁnite, and usually has no other modiﬁers (including
quantiﬁers), as in 18.14 (ñapwi m@wi ‘ﬁrewood and things like that’, gu m@wi ‘water and things
like that’), T3.24 and 14.155 (‘children and things like that’), and 20.3:20.3 [ [d@ a-d@                kabay] ad@ka                         yi-ta:y]     [ [bal

     sit-fut/irr-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt say-cotemp
     ‘That very one (previously mentioned) (topical) snake having gone (and) killed pigs and
     things like that brought (them) to her, so that she should not be hungry’ (lit. having said
     ‘she might be hungry’)  A noun phrase containing m@wi is one NP and not two coordinated ones, for three reasons.
First, it is pronounced as one intonation unit without any pause. Secondly, no other constituent
can intervene between the two. And thirdly, it takes one case marker at the end of the NP—see
20.4 (these criteria are addressed at E, at the end of the section).20.4 [væs m@wi:k]-a:b                 yi      ma:
     grass things.like.that+dat-too go:neg neg
     ‘(One) mustn’t go to get grass and things like that’ (lit. for grass and things like that)  The form m@wi can be used to modify a component of a lexicalized complex predicate (see
§17.3), as in 20.5. This shows that at least some such components are essentially nominal in
nature:
510     20 Clause Types and Discourse-Pragmatic Devices20.5 [wi    kulapu-ta:y] [s@kul@k m@wi             yi-ta:y]      [ [n@k@        ja:p]

     stay-do.incessantly-3fem.sgbas.p
     ‘Cleaning the house, cooking and doing things like that, washing one thing and another,
     she kept staying in the house’
If a mass noun occurs in a noun phrase with the generic m@wi ‘things like this, things of similar
nature’, the noun phrase requires plural agreement on the verb and on the reactivated topic
demonstrative, as in 6.21.
A.IV. Synonymous noun phrases consist of two near-synonyms (without a linker). These are
rare and are employed as a stylistic device for rhetorical purposes. Unlike the types A.I–III,
the order does not appear to be ﬁxed. In 20.6, ‘(paternal) grandfather’ and ‘ancestor’ refer to
the same person. These terms are almost synonymous: gwa:l on its own can be used to refer to
any paternal ancestor.
20.6 [al@m                   r@-ku]        [k@tay k@ti
     dem.dist+fem.sg+loc stay-compl.ss around around

     see-3masc.sgsubj.p-3fem.sgbas.p I-lk-masc.sg grandfather ancestor
     ‘Having stayed there, he looked around, my grandfather-ancestor’
  A similar example is karaki kabay (death.adder snake) ‘the snake death adder’ in T3.3. Both
components of the NP acquire a plural form if they have one, as in 20.7.
20.7 [ñan-a-di gwalugw         waraga:gw] [ya-n]        [kar-da-l]
     we-lk-pl grandfather+pl ancestor+pl come-seq bring-down-3fem.sgbas.p
     [d@-k@-l-a]
     he-poss-3fem.sgnom-3fem.sgnom
     ‘This is the story of how our ancestors (lit. our grandfathers ancestors) brought (the
     people) down by coming’
Appositional noun phrases of this type are very similar to synonymous compounds discussed
under §9.3 (type 4). However, unlike compounds, synonymous appositional NPs form two
grammatical and phonological words.
B. Recognizing the head of a noun phrase. The head of a noun phrase is generally easy to
recognize: it determines number and gender agreement on each of the agreeing modiﬁers (see
§4.3 and §§10.2–3), and cross-referencing on the verb. In 20.2, Kainu is the head of the NP and
is cross-referenced with the masculine singular throughout the noun phrase in brackets, and as
addressee on the verb of speech. As shown in Chapter 7, case markers go onto the head noun
which in most cases is also the last word in a noun phrase. Only the coordinating comitative
behaves diﬀerently: it occurs on each of the coordinands, or just the last one (see §7.9). If the
postposed modiﬁer is a number or a quantiﬁer, the case marking remains on the head noun as
in 7.50 and 10.142 (asa:k viti (dog+lk+dat two) ‘of two dogs’).
C. Noun phrase coordination and disjunction. Noun phrase coordination can be achieved
with a coordinating comitative case -wa (see §7.9), the argument elaboration (inclusory)
construction, or both (§6.2.3). A participant marked with the comitative or its equivalent
                                                              20.1 Major constituents       511(postposition wuk@n) has a lesser role in the joint activity. An alternative is the coordinating
connective wa (§4.5.3 and §7.9). This implies that the conjoined participants are equal, as
in 20.8.
20.8 ata war-b@r         [Lumawad@m wa Parmali]
     then go.up-3dubas.p Lumawandem and Parmali
     ‘Lumawandem and Parmali then went up(stream)’
  The connective can also be used in an argument elaboration construction, as in 20.9. This
appears in the speech of those who are highly proﬁcient in Tok Pisin and English, and may well
be a calque.
20.9 b@r [ [amæy m@d]         wa [a-d@               [ñan m@d] ] ]     b@      yara
     3du mother cassowary and dem.dist-masc.sg child cassowary already well
     a-d@              kaw sar-@n      væki-br@-d
     dem.dist-masc.sg hole jump-seq cross-3dusubj.p-3masc.sgbas.p
     ‘They two mother and son cassowary crossed the hole jumping’ (lit. they two mother
     cassowary and child cassowary already crossed the hole well by jumping over it)
   The connective wa can occur in a double comitative construction, as an additional mark of
joint activity of both participants, as in 7.79.
   There may be a historical connection between the comitative -wa, and the connective wa.
This requires further investigation, as soon as further information on Ndu languages becomes
available. The connective is much rarer in texts and in conversations than any other coordinat-
ing device. It is never used to coordinate clauses.
   If more than two participants are coordinated, several techniques may be employed. In
20.10, there are ﬁve coordinands (plus the speaker). The noun phrase contains a coordinating
comitative, and the rest of the participants are in apposition to each other. The adverb nakamib
‘together’ (see 6.39 on its use in lieu of argument elaboration constructions) is placed between
the complex noun phrase and the verb which is marked for ﬁrst person plural: the speaker was
among the participants.
20.10 [ [ [wun-a-di ñan-ugw d@y-a-k@               kwasa        gwa:l]         Abasadu]
      I-lk-pl       child-pl they-lk-poss+fem.sg little.fem.sg granddaughter Abasadu
      D@miyawi-wa Gab@lmæg Yapikudi asa:y] nakamib yi-ba-l
      Demiyawi-com Gabelmag Yapikudi father together go-1plsubj.p-3fem.sgbas.p
      ‘Abasadu, the little classiﬁcatory granddaughter of my children with Demiyawi, Gabel-
      mag, Yapikudi (and) father, together we went (that time)’
And in 20.11, the connective wa is placed between the last two coordinands. This pattern is
very similar to Tok Pisin and English (in which the speaker was highly proﬁcient). That is, this
may well be a calque from either of these contact languages:
20.11 [ [m@n   Yuas@s@g] [wun Yuan@g] wa [l@ Ñamamayrata:kw] ñan gwalugw
      you.masc Yuas@s@ng I       Yuan@ng and she Ñamamayratakw we clan
      nak] [Maliau-adian]
      one Maliau-1plnom
      ‘You Yuas@s@ng, I Yuan@ng, and she Ñamamayratakw we (belong to) one clan, we are
      Maliau’
  The coordinands themselves are complex noun phrases, each consisting of a pronoun fol-
lowed by a personal name.
512      20 Clause Types and Discourse-Pragmatic Devices   The suﬃx -a:b, -aba:b ‘too’ is also used as a way of coordinating noun phrases—see 20.13
below, and the discussion in §9.2.
   Juxtaposition of noun phrases is used for two additional purposes. First, a juxtaposed
noun can provide additional information to the preceding noun phrase, as in T2.63, k@-di
Sabrayi-b@r Vali:k (dem.prox-pl Sabray-ass.pl Vali:k) ‘these relatives of Sabrayi, the Vali:k
clan’. We can recall, from §19.7, that juxtaposed clauses can be employed in a similar function
(see 19.81).
   Secondly, two noun phrases or two modiﬁers within a noun phrase can be juxtaposed as a
means of expressing disjunction, e.g. 20.12–13. Lengthy noun phrases like the one in 20.13 are
not very frequent in discourse.
20.12 [a-d@              ñan b@         numa-d]            [ [ [nabi mugul a:li] k@t@k]
      dem.dist-masc.sg child already big-3masc.sgnom year            three four like
      ta:d]
      become+3masc.sgbas.p
      ‘That child was already big, he was approximately (lit. like) three or four years old’
20.13 [ñan-a          t@p      mugul o t@p        a:li] [Malu Avatip Yuanab Yawabak
      we-lk+fem.sg village three or village four Malu Avatip Yuanab Yawabak
      k@-di-a:b]
      dem.prox-pl-too
      ‘Our villages (are) three or four, Malu, Avatip, Yuanab, and Yawabak, these too’
   The ﬁrst noun phrase in 20.13 illustrates an additional strategy used for disjunction—the
Tok Pisin loan conjunction o. This is now used by speakers of all generations, to conjoin noun
phrases, as in 20.13, or modiﬁers, as in 20.14, or even clauses, as in 10.82. The speaker who
asked 20.14 was among the few old ladies whose Tok Pisin was rather fractured; this did not
stop her from using the Tok Pisin import o.
20.14 [kwasa        o numa]        gu      yaku-na-ñ@n
      little.fem.sg or big.fem.sg water wash-act.foc-2fem.sgbas.vt
      ‘Have you washed a little bit or all over?’ (lit. have you water-washed a little or a lot?)
  This conjunction can link sentences, as in 20.15 (continuation of 10.82). There is a pause
between the two sentences, the second of which is introduced with o. The character was trying
to ﬁnd out whether the owner of the house was a man or a woman:
20.15 [du kwa-na-d-@                           wi-ad]                pause [o ta:kw
      man stay-act.foc-3masc.sgbas.vt-lk house-3masc.sgnom pause or woman
      kwa-na-d-@                         wi-ad]
      stay-act.foc-3masc.sgbas.vt-lk house-3masc.sgnom
      ‘Is it a house where a man stays (lives)? Or is it a house where a woman stays (lives)?’
   If there are more than two alternatives, the loan disjunction o occurs between the last two,
e.g. Telefom@n Oksapm@n o Vanimo-a:m (Telefomin Oksapmin or Vanimo-lk+loc) ‘in Tele-
fomin, Oksapmin, or Vanimo’. Once again, this is a Tok Pisin pattern replicated in Manambu.
   Another option is to use the repeated conjunction aw ‘then’ (see §19.6) which then refers to
alternating actions or marks alternatives, as in aw kami: aw lau-lap (then ﬁsh then ripe-banana)
‘(we eat) sometimes ﬁsh sometimes banana (or both)’.
D. The order, and types, of modifiers in noun phrases. No noun phrases have all the
positions ﬁlled, for semantic and phonological reasons. The longest noun phrase in the corpus
                                                                20.1 Major constituents       513contains six modiﬁers: a-d-@ n@k@-d-@ [wiy-a-m s@ kwa-na-d-@] n@ma-d-@ gla-ka-g@l du-a
ñan (dem.dist-masc.sg-lk other-masc.sg-lk house-lk-loc sleep lie-act.foc-3masc.sgbas.vt-
lk big-masc.sg-lk black-int-black man-lk child) ‘that other very black boy (male child) lying
asleep in the house’. An average noun phrase is likely to contain two to three modiﬁers, e.g.
br@-br@-k@ n@k@ kapab-a wi (3du-3du-poss+fem.sg other+fem.sg separate-lk house) ‘another
separate house of well and truly their own’.
   A modiﬁer can itself be a noun phrase, as in [[Yuajan kuk@b]-a du] (Yuajan behind+term-lk
man) ‘son who followed Yuajan’ (lit. man after Yuajan).
   The article-like third person pronouns do not combine with the inherently indeﬁnite noun
m@wi ‘things like this’. There can be just one quantiﬁer or a numeral in a noun phrase, and
not more than two adjectives. Typically, in a complex noun phrase only one of the coordinands
is a long possessive NP—as in 20.10. In everyday conversations, speakers avoid long noun
phrases—this is in contrast to long clause chains which nobody (except for children under 10)
seems to mind using under any circumstances. In T1.23 a demonstrative precedes a posses-
sive modiﬁer (a-d@ l@-k@-d@ ñamus (dem.dist-masc.sg she-obl-masc.sg younger.sibling) ‘that
younger brother of hers’). In T1.14, a demonstrative precedes a relative clause (k@ s@ kwa-na
bap (dem.prox.fem.sg sleep stay-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt moon) ‘this sleeping moon’). A noun
phrase with three modiﬁers (‘he this son of ours’, that is, ‘this previously mentioned child of
ours’) is at 20.70.
   Alternatively, an NP containing modiﬁers can occupy the possessor slot, or both as in
T3.34 [[a:bab-a du ta:kw] d@y-a-k@ya:m] (all-lk man woman they-lk-poss+fem.sg smell)
‘the smell of all the people’, and in [[amæy karaki] l@-k@-d@ [a-d@ numa-d@ wiya:m]]
(mother death.adder she-obl-masc.sg dem.dist-masc.sg big-masc.sg house+lk+loc) ‘in that
big house of mother death adder’. A relative clause can contain a noun with a modiﬁer, as in
T3.40 ([[a-l-ay ñan] s@ki-la-d@ s@] (dem.dist-fem.sg-dist youngster call.name-3fem.sgsubj.vt-
3masc.sgbas.vt name) ‘the name that young lady there called’). An example of a complex noun
phrase with a relative clause in both possessor and possessee is in 20.22.
   A noun phrase of any length can occur with a postposition: see §4.5.2. A possessee—the
head of the noun phrase—can be modiﬁed by a demonstrative, as in T3.5 ([a-di [karaki l@-k@-
di ñan-ugw]] (dem.dist-pl death.adder she-obl-pl child-pl) ‘those children of a death adder’).
An NP with modiﬁers can be in apposition to, say, a pronoun, as in T1.32 (ñan [k@-di k@pa-
k@-di ta:kw] (we dem.prox-pl earth+lk-poss-pl woman) ‘we these women of this earth’).
   The order of modiﬁers in an NP tends to be ﬁxed. Agreeing modiﬁers (third person pronoun
in article-like function and demonstratives) precede the non-agreeing ones, and the third person
pronoun in an article-like function always precedes all other agreeing modiﬁers, e.g. [d@ a-d@
n@k@-d@ du] (he dist.dem-masc.sg other-masc.sg man) ‘that very one (previously mentioned
important participant) other man’ (also see 10.3).
   A noun phrase cannot contain a sequence of two agreeing adjectives (see §4.3.1). If two
agreeing adjectives occur together one of them has an adverbial meaning, e.g. kwasa n@ma-
p@k-a ñan (small+fem.sg big+fem.sg-compar-lk child) ‘a child that is a little bigger (than
another child)’.
   A noun phrase usually contains no more than two adjectives. An agreeing adjective precedes
the non-agreeing one (as shown in §4.3.1). In a sequence of non-agreeing adjectives, a dimen-
sion term precedes a colour term, as in g@rg@r ñikiñiki ñan (tiny red:red child) ‘tiny pink baby’
(said ironically to a 3-year-old crying as if she were a baby). This is similar to many languages,
including English. A non-agreeing value adjective precedes another non-agreeing adjective, as
in vyakata-yak@ kula p@taka:u (good-very new ladder) ‘a good new ladder’. Only once did
I register a noun phrase with three adjectives: the agreeing adjective preceded the sequence
514     20 Clause Types and Discourse-Pragmatic Devicesof non-agreeing ones: kwasa-kwasa g@rg@r ñikiñiki ñan (small-red+fem.sg tiny red:red child)
‘little tiny pink baby’.
    There are just two instances of variable word order within a noun phrase, which is deter-
mined by pragmatic parameters. First, a demonstrative and a pronominal possessive marker
may occur in either order. In 20.16, the demonstrative precedes the possessive marker and in
20.2 it follows.
20.16 [l@ kamnagw-a:b ma: kray]            [gu-a:b    ma: kray         [a-d@
      she food-too       neg bring+neg water-too neg bring+neg dem.dist-masc.sg
      l@-k@-d@         ñ@n@k-a:b] ]
      she-obl-masc.sg child+lk+dat-too
      ‘She did not bring the food either, did not bring the water either for that (previously
      mentioned) child of hers either’
   The reason for the diﬀerent positions of demonstratives lies in the status of the head noun. In
20.2, the new participant, Kainu, has just been introduced, while Lumawandem, the possessor,
is an established referent. In 20.16, the child has been introduced some time ago (also see
§20.2, for an explanation of a non-verb-ﬁnal constituent order here); the demonstrative here
has a distinctly anaphoric function.
   Numerals (other than ‘one’) and quantiﬁers can either precede or follow the head noun. We
saw in §§10.5–6 that a newly introduced or a non-topical referent is followed by a quantiﬁer,
and once the referent is established it is preceded by a quantiﬁer. In 20.17, the characters ate
any old three bananas, and so the numeral follows the noun.
20.17 [ [laulap mugul] kan        napa-da-k]           [ada
      banana three eat+seq compl.vb-3pl-compl.ds dem.dist.react.top+masc.sg
      wa:d]
      say+3masc.sgbas.p
      ‘After they’d eaten three bananas, he then said’
  In contrast, in 20.18 the children are deﬁnite, and so the numeral precedes the head noun. A
preposed quantiﬁer or a numeral takes a linker.
20.18 [ [k@-di     mugul-a ñan-ugw] kur-ku]           [ata ya:l]
      dem.prox-pl three-lk child-pl get-compl.ss then go+3fem.sgbas.p
      ‘Having taken these three children she then went’
Similar examples are at 10.116–17. This goes hand in hand with the general principle of
ordering words and constituents in Manambu: a new and less established participant comes
ﬁrst. We return to this in §20.2.
   We will see, in the next chapter, that many speakers code-switch with Tok Pisin. The code-
switches behave in somewhat peculiar ways—which justify their treatment as ‘foreign morphol-
ogy’. The complex issue of how such code-switches are assigned to word classes in Manambu
was mentioned in §4.5.6. Code-switches are equally foreign with respect to their syntactic
position: as predicted by Moravcsik (1978), they occupy the same position in a Manambu
constituent as they would in Tok Pisin, despite the fact that such a position would have been
unthinkable in ‘proper’ Manambu (see §22.4).
   So, wanpela ta:kw (one:tp woman) is a spontaneously produced variant of ta:kw nak
‘one woman’, and wanpela liklik ma:j (one:tp small:tp story) or wanpela kwasa ma:j (one:tp
small+fem.sg story) both correspond to kwasa ma:j nak (small+fem.sg story one) ‘one little
story’. Such noun phrases with foreign forms in a foreign order are marginal in that they are
rare, and speakers have a pejorative attitude towards them.
                                                                20.1 Major constituents        515   Only two such foreign elements have been observed in the domain of complex predicates, or
clauses. One is a Tok Pisin modal mas ‘must’ which can occur with third person imperative in
the meaning of strong obligation (13.22). The other is Tok Pisin nogut which was once used
by a speaker as a nonce code-switch accompanied by a dependent negative clause (14.125),
mirroring a corresponding structure in Manambu.
E. The limits of a noun phrase. A few more questions remain. First, how do we determine
the boundaries of a noun phrase? The relevant criteria include having one case per noun
phrase (see §7.1). So, for instance, the allative case form of an appositional noun phrase
Mak@mawi n@b@k ‘Makemawi mountain’ is Mak@mawi n@b@k@r . This is in contrast to 16.55
where [adaki n@b@k@r] [pause] [Mak@mawir] (dem.dist.masc.sg.across.away hill+lk+dat,
Makemawi+dat) ‘to (that) hill across (away from us), to Makemawi’ corresponds to two noun
phrases. This brings us to the next criterion—that of prosodic cohesion. The insertion of a
pause between the two allative-marked constituents indicates that these are indeed two noun
phrases.
   Also, if a noun phrase appears in a highlighting focus construction it is focused as a whole: a
part of an NP cannot be focused separately. This explains why no constituent can be focused in
relative clauses, as shown in Table 19.1. That is, focalization is another criterion which helps us
determine the boundaries of an NP. Non-word class-changing suﬃxes detailed in §9.2 appear
once per noun phrase. And the emphatic enclitic -ya always goes onto the last word in a noun
phrase.
   And, in addition to all this, we saw that the word order in a noun phrase is mostly ﬁxed—
except for the two instances of variable order in D above. For instance, an adjective followed
by a demonstrative belong to diﬀerent noun phrases, even if pronounced without a pause. An
example is in 20.19:
20.19 [wun kwasa            t@-lwun-@k]                      [kwasa]
      I      small+fem.sg be/stand-1fem.sgbas.p-conf small+fem.sg
      [ [k@laki                   Kudaway] l@-k@                  ñ@np@k]
      dem.prox+fem.sg+across Kudaway she-obl+fem.sg child+like
      ‘I was little (when the war started), little, like the daughter (lit. feminine child) of this
      Kudaway across away’
  This example contains two noun phrases: one is an adjective ‘small’ (feminine singular) used
headlessly, and the other is a possessive construction accompanied with the suﬃx -p@k ‘like’
with the possessor modiﬁed by a demonstrative. The speaker, Kukelyabau, spoke very fast,
and there were no pauses between the two. The placement of the demonstrative is indicative of
an NP boundary.
  But are noun phrases in Manambu always contiguous? They are not. However, instances
of split noun phrases are limited to noun phrases with numerals and quantiﬁers as modiﬁers.
The numeral or the quantiﬁer can be split from the rest of the NP and postposed to the verb,
as a clariﬁcation (see §20.2). An example is in 20.20: the two women were staying together;
this togetherness is emphasized by positioning the numeral modiﬁer after the verb. There is no
pause before ‘two’—as would have been expected, if this were an afterthought.
20.20 [a-b@r      ta:kw] pause abra                       kwa-b@r [viti]
      dem.dist-du woman pause dem.dist.react.top+du stay-3dubas.p two
      ‘Those women stayed (topical) two (of them together)’
We return to the functions of this postposed numeral in §20.2.
  If a relative clause contains an additional argument or oblique, it can be placed into a
sentence-initial position as a means of focalizing it. We can recall, from Table 19.1, that no
516     20 Clause Types and Discourse-Pragmatic Devicesconstituent of a relative clause can be focused independently. That is, removing an argument
or an oblique from within the relative clause and preposing it is the only available means of
focusing on it. Note that in such cases a relative clause—but not the whole noun phrase—is
discontinuous:
20.21a [gwa:r        a-d@            yi-d-@                 kwasa-d@        ñan]

       tayib           waku-d
       before+term go.out-3masc.sgbas.p
       ‘That little boy who drowned (lit. to water that one which went) left home before (his
       mother)’
  The order of words without such preposition would have been:
20.21b [a-d@              gwa:r       yi-d-@                  kwasa-d@       ñan]
       dem.dist-masc.sg water+all go-3masc.sgbas.p-lk small-masc.sg child
       tayib          waku-d
       before+term go.out-3masc.sgbas.p
       ‘That little boy who drowned (lit. went to water) left home before (his mother)’
  We saw in §10.2.3 that reactivated topic demonstratives do not form one NP with the noun
they refer to (typically an O, an S, or a location). They agree with this noun in gender and
number, but can never take any cases or suﬃxes or be arguments of postpositions. There can be
an intonation break between a demonstrative and an NP it refers to (as in 10.66 and in 20.20)—
something atypical for an NP. Within a clause, they tend to occur immediately preceding the
verb, as in 20.20 and 20.22.
20.22 [ [a-d@               [k@-laki                   ta:kw]

      I will tell those (topical) stories of that traditional story of the shrimp written by this

That is, reactivated topic demonstratives are not modiﬁers to a noun within a noun phrase,
even though they get translated as such, for want of a better equivalent in English.","[535, 536, 537, 538, 539, 540, 541, 542, 543]"
"   In addition to shared structural features, Manambu has a few lexical loans from Iatmul. The
Manambu, similarly to many other Sepik groups, have an overwhelmingly ‘importing culture’.
This implies an emphasis on exchange and value assigned to outside goods, both material and
non-material (Mead 1938). In many Sepik societies, language was traditionally considered on
a par with material goods—spells, incantations, and even names and individual words being
traded and bought (see Harrison 1990a: 20–3).
                                        22.3 Loans from Western Iatmul and elsewhere           601   In Harrison’s (1990a: 20) words, ‘from an historical perspective, the circulation of ritual
forms in the regional trading system seems to have been a key formative inﬂuence on Manambu
society . . . , because the most valued scarce resources among the Manambu, and the items of
strategic prestige value in the political system of their villages, were rights in ritual property,
much of which the Manambu acquired from the Iatmul. Manambu ritual and cosmology
seem, in fact, to be not only a kind of patchwork of the ritual and cosmological traditions
of neighbouring societies, but a largely bought patchwork, acquired piecemeal through trade.’
Trading ownership of names and cults is a feature of numerous Sepik cultures—including the
Kwoma (Bowden 1983: 67), the Abelam, and the Iatmul (Bateson 1958).
   These ‘acquisitions’ used to surface in various speech styles, many of them eﬀectively lost
in modern days. Harrison (1990a: 78) reports that shamanic spirits used to speak ‘through
their human mediums in a special, arcane language, intelligible only to those with many
years of experience of shamanic séances, which is actually a kind of Manambu-based jargon
with exaggerated outré Iatmul features’. Harrison stresses that in Manambu, ‘all speciﬁcally
“religious” forms of speech borrow heavily from Western Iatmul’. We will see, in §22.6.1, that
due to the encroaching inﬂuence of Western culture (including the virtual obsolescence of
initiation) most of the religious registers are rapidly falling into oblivion, and with them the
‘Iatmulized’ forms of speech.
   Some Iatmul imports are still actively used in poetic register, and are identiﬁed by speakers
themselves as being originally Iatmul. The songs of foiled marriages and love aﬀairs, known as
namay and sui, and also mourning songs (gra-kudi) are a case in point. These poetic literary
forms (improvised by performers) consist of two parallel stanzas, each referred to either as ap@k
‘side, part’, or ag@k ‘side, counterpart (one of two)’. Such songs typically consist of a string of
not-too-complex sentences interspersed with totemic address terms and names (often relating
to the clan of the addressee or the ‘character’ of the song). The second stanza restates the
ﬁrst one in diﬀerent wording using what the Manambu speakers call ‘shadowy’ register, or ‘the
other side’ (ag@kem ‘on the (other) side of two’). This reﬂects the binarism, or ‘parallelism’, a
pervasive feature of the Sepik culture—in Bateson’s (1958: 239) words, ‘the idea that everything
in the world has its equal and opposite counterpart’ (also see Harrison 1983: 20, on binarism
in the song styles).
   While gra-kudi, the mourning songs, are the prerogative of women (typically, old and knowl-
edgeable ones), namay and sui can be sung by both men and women. Harrison (1983) put
together a collection of namay sung by men (also see his comment on the role of mythological
setting and secret knowledge in the creation of namay). Women also compose namay and
sui, and sing them—traditionally, on women-only ﬁshing expeditions or anywhere where men
would not be able to overhear them. I recorded over twenty namay sung by women (most of
them over 50); but was told not to share them with anyone since they discuss the foiled loves,
suitors, and nostalgic feelings for men other than their husbands, and if I disclosed them, this
might get these women into trouble.
   My estimate is that the ‘other side’ register may have traditionally contained several hun-
dred words. At present, few people have complete knowledge of it. A number of kinship
terms and items from other semantic groups have a ‘shadowy’ equivalent, while most do
not. The kin terms which are the same in both ‘sides’ include gwa:l ‘father’s father’, yæ:y
‘father’s mother’ (similarly to the ‘Mother-in-law’ language in some Australian languages:
Dixon 1990), kagr@s ‘son’s wife’, and kajal ‘brother’s wife’, as well as numerous body part
terms, such as m@l ‘eye’, and verbs, e.g. væk@r ‘fall’, v@- ‘see’. Many clan address names have
a shadowy equivalent—for instance, the equivalent of g@ñap ‘address term for Yimal clan’ is
kwalap.
602     22 Genetic and Areal Relationships   Table 22.3 illustrates a sample of words which have an equivalent in the ‘other side’ (or
‘shadowy’) register. Loans from Iatmul—shown in bold—include ﬁve kinship terms and one
body part term. The kinship terms—all except one of which (waw) were recognized by the
authors of the songs as being Iatmul imports—have the same meaning in Manambu as in
Iatmul.
   The body part term da:m ‘nose’ in the ‘shadowy’ register is a Iatmul form adapted to
Manambu (the real Iatmul form is da:ma, cf. the Manambu form ta:m ‘nose’; most probably
Proto-Ndu ∗ da:ma ‘nose’). The term da:m is used as the equivalent of another body part, ‘ear’.
   And this takes us to at least three principles discernible for the correspondences between
‘everyday’ items and their ‘shadowy’ counterparts. First, the choice of a ‘shadowy’ counterpart
may involve the opposite—as is the case for ‘hand, arm’ and ‘foot, leg’; and also ‘ﬁngers’ and
‘toes’ (these are switched). This is somewhat reminiscent of the ‘upside-down Warlbiri’, ‘spoken
by guardians in the presence of junior novices’, that is, by initiated men in the Warlbiri men’s
rituals (Hale 1971: 473). The principle of the ‘upside-down Warlbiri’ is: ‘replace each noun,
verb and pronoun of ordinary Warlbiri by an “antonym”.’
   Secondly, a distinction in the everyday terms may be neutralized in the ‘shadowy’ register—
as is the case for ‘sun’ and ‘moon’ (from a mythological, or totemic, point of view this
makes sense inasmuch as ‘sun’ and ‘moon’ are totems of the same clan group). And ﬁnally,
a more general term may be used to subsume a more speciﬁc one—this is the case with ‘child,
youngster (a term also used for uninitiated men)’ and ‘young (person) in general’, and perhaps
also ‘nose’ and ‘face’ (as its generic location).
   In the limited data available, verbs seem to be replaced by other verbs, with somewhat similar
meanings (see the last three rows in Table 22.3).
   If only a part of a word has a counterpart in the ‘shadowy’ register, and the other part does
not, then only the ﬁrst part will change. Many of the names of the Maliau clan start with
Yu-a (shell.valuable-lk); their shadowy counterparts start with Rama (see Table 22.3), e.g. the
names Yua-n@g—shadowy register Rama-n@g; Yua-muk—shadowy register Rama-muk. (Yu as
an object is a totem of the Maliau clan; the origin of Ram(a) is unknown.)
   Little more can be said at this stage about the semantics and the forms in the ‘shadowy’
register. An additional complication lies in the nature of the knowledge associated with this
register: an outsider’s attempts to gain unjustiﬁed knowledge of this run the danger of being
treated as attempts to unlawfully appropriate a valuable. And in addition, fewer and fewer
people still have this knowledge.
   There is little evidence of loans into Manambu from other Ndu sources. The only loan from
Abelam-Wosera is the mixed origin term gai-du, gai-ta:kw ‘address term for the Abelam people,
or the people of the Maprik area’. This consists of an adjusted version of Abelam-Wosera gayé
‘village’ and Manambu du ‘man’, ta:kw ‘woman’. An alternative is simply gai. The Abelam-
Wosera people do not ﬁgure among the traditional trade partners of any of the Manambu clans
(the major partners include the Chambri, the Sawos, the Iatmul, the Kaunga, the Kwoma, the
Yessan-Mayo, and the Yerikai-Garamambu: see Harrison 1990a: 23, 70–2). Yet, there is an
ongoing trade relationship between the Abelam-Wosera and the Manambu: even nowadays,
the Manambu women routinely go to Maprik to sell their dried ﬁsh to the locals who pay
them with stringbags, other goods, and money. According to my consultants, these trade links
are of a considerable antiquity. This explains the existence of a special address term for the
Abelam-Wosera.
   The term Ñaura, Ñaula used by the Manambu for the Iatmul in general comes from Iatmul
itself (it is an autodenomination of the Western Iatmul), and the term Kum for the Kwoma
is a loan from the Kwoma autodenomination kwow ma ‘hill people’ (Bowden 1997: xv, 105).

   There is no evidence for any other loans, except for a few curious similarities with Oceanic.
One such similarity is the Manambu irregular imperatives of the verb ya- ‘come’, mæy, and
of the verb yi- ‘go’, ma:y (see Table 13.2). The form mæy ‘come’ looks very much like Proto-
Oceanic ∗ mai ‘come’ (see, for instance, Lynch, Ross, and Crowley 2002: 47). Could this be
a borrowing, or is it a simple coincidence? A potential cognate to either mæy or ma:y is the
Abelam imperative marker mé (Wilson 1980: 165), which does not preclude the possibility of
the form being borrowed from coastal Oceanic languages in northern New Guinea. And we
can recall, from §1.5.3, that at least one clan group of the Manambu claims to have come from
the coast.
   The term for ‘dog’, a:s(a), is especially intriguing in light of this. It bears a similarity
to Proto-Austronesian ∗ asu ‘dog’, reconstructed on the basis of reﬂexes in the languages of
Taiwan, the Philippines, western Indonesia, and others, but hitherto unattested in any Oceanic
language with which a Papuan language could have come in contact. A number of Oceanic
languages of Bougainville have a form for ‘dog’ reconstructible as ∗∗ kasu; however, positing a
reconstruction higher than Proto-North-Bougainville appears to be dubious (Andrew Pawley,
p.c.). The dog was introduced to New Guinea through coastal areas, and perhaps through
maritime coastal trade into the Sepik-Ramu area, and the date given is circa 5500 bc. The
archaeological data indicate that the introduction of the dog in New Guinea may have been
consistent with the Lapita/Austronesian culture (Jack Golson, p.c.). If the dog was indeed
introduced by Austronesians in the coastal areas, and then spread further inland, it would not
be surprising that the name for dog could have been of Austronesian descent. The word wa:sa
‘dog’ in Abelam may indicate that if the term for ‘dog’ was indeed borrowed, the borrowing
could have occurred at the Proto-Ndu stage. This, however, is pure speculation.
   Manambu (and other Ndu languages) have a number of further lookalikes with Oceanic
and Austronesian. Proto-Oceanic ∗ manuk ‘bird’ (with its variants manu, ma:n, or ma:n in
coastal New Guinea languages: Andrew Pawley, p.c.) is similar to Manambu ma:n, Iatmul
ma:n, and Kwoma manu ‘bird of paradise’. And Proto-Oceanic ∗ taw ‘man’ could be compared
to the Proto-Ndu ∗ du(e) ‘man, male’ (cf. Boiken tuo ‘man’ which earned Boiken the name
Tuo-language by Kirschbaum 1922). However, these are likely to be mere coincidences.
   Curious ‘foreign language’ insertions occur in the stories which comprise my Manambu
corpus. Gemaj, a highly qualiﬁed story teller, quoted an evil character who, according to
her, was speaking ‘dry-land man’s language’ (n@b@-du kudi wa:d dry.land-man language
speak+3masc.sgbas.p). Examples 22.1 and 22.2 come from essentially the same story told on
two diﬀerent occasions. Insertions in the unidentiﬁed language are in italics.22.1 wus sakura-m@ni, au wus sakura-w@ni n@b-@                 du kudi         wus

   So far, I haven’t been able to identify these inserts. It is obvious that they come from the same
language. Judging by the person marking, it appears to be a Ndu language (but not Gala).
The obvious source is Kaunga (the closest ‘dry-land people’ who speak a Ndu language: see
Harrison 1993: 33–4 on the Manambu–Kaunga relations). This needs to be veriﬁed when more
Kaunga data become available.
   It is possible that some examples of ‘animal talk’ are in fact insertions from other languages,
e.g. sakatelo ‘sound made by man transformed into a victoria pigeon’.
   Very few grammatical descriptions, and dictionaries, are as yet available for most languages
of the Sepik area. At the present time, we have many more questions than answers as to
why some of the Sepik languages share rather unusual, ‘exotic’ features. Can it be a simple
coincidence that shape-based gender assignment is attested in Ndu languages, and in Alamblak
and Sare, or Kapriman (both Sepik Hill) (Bruce 1984; Sumbuk 1999)? And that the unusual
patterns of cross-referencing in Manambu (§3.1) are so strikingly similar to those in Alamblak?
What is the nature of the areal diﬀusion of patterns within the Sepik area? These questions are
undecidable—until well-founded facts can be provided.
   Nowadays, the major agents of foreign inﬂuence on Manambu are Tok Pisin and English,
the two lingua francas of Papua New Guinea as a whole.
         22.4 i n f lu e n c e o f t o k pi s i n a n d o f e n g l i s h: b o r row i n g
                                  and code- s w i tc h i n gAt present, all the Manambu people are proﬁcient in Tok Pisin: there are no Manambu
monolinguals. As mentioned in Chapter 1, just a few old ladies are more comfortable speaking
Manambu than Tok Pisin. I was told that two children in Avatip (one 4, one 6 years of age,
in 2004) speak nothing but Manambu; but no one seemed to know exactly where they lived,
or how to ﬁnd them. Schooling is conducted in Papua New Guinea English (see §1.4.2 on
the incipient Manambu ‘tok ples’ programmes in primary schools in Yawabak and Avatip).
The result is not really a balanced triglossia: Tok Pisin and English tend to dominate many
domains, such as village council, churches, and parent–teacher meetings. The latter is not so
surprising given that of a dozen or so teachers at the Avatip school, two or three are usually
not Manambu, and even those teachers who are Manambu prefer communicating in English
or Tok Pisin to make sure they do not exclude the outsiders or those children whose Manambu
is halting.
606     22 Genetic and Areal Relationships   Even the meetings accompanying the mortuary ritual K@k@t@p involve a large amount of
interaction in Tok Pisin. This is to do with their major topic which concerns the distribution
of material wealth between the parties and power relationships in general. The powerful ‘big’
men (numa-d@ du) intersperse their speech with Tok Pisin inserts, even during the name debate
ceremony. We will see below that Tok Pisin and, even more so, English are the languages of
authority. This, and also the fact that men are exposed to the outside world more than women,
explains why men of all generations code-switch more than women.
   The encroaching dominance of Tok Pisin is speeded up by the number of outsiders living in
the villages, especially in Avatip, mostly as the result of mixed marriages. A few non-Manambu
women do speak the language (for instance, Nelma, Iatmul herself, is a very proﬁcient speaker;
and so is Jag@r, Yuamali (Jacklyn’s) husband), but even they often communicate with their
children in Tok Pisin.
   We start with the status of Tok Pisin and English ‘inserts’ as borrowings, or code-switches
(§22.4.1), and then look at their morphological and syntactic integration into the language
(§22.4.2). We also mention the issue of syntactic calques in Manambu. Then, in §22.4.3, we
discuss the functions of these ‘inserts’.","[627, 628, 629, 630, 631, 632, 633]"

        4.2.2 Semantically and grammatically determined subclasses of verbsVerbs fall into several transitivity classes—see A below. Polyfunctional verbs are a special
subclass—see B. The verb ‘give’ forms a class on its own—see C. A small class of weather
verbs is discussed under D, and complex verbs consisting of a verbal root and a non-verbal
component are under E.
  A few other verbs display unusual grammatical and semantic features. These include
ingestive verbs k@- ‘consume (eat, drink, smoke)’ and j @- ‘chew’; verbs of speech; generic
verbs; and verbs of perception. These are discussed in §§21.1–3. Verbs can be classiﬁed
with respect to how they combine with directional markers—see §16.1.1. Further, minor
                                                                                    4.2 Verbs       79properties of various semantic subclasses of verbs will be discussed throughout the grammar as
appropriate.
A. In terms of Transitivity Classes, Manambu has strictly intransitive, transitive, and ditran-
sitive verbs. Strictly intransitive verbs include motion verbs, e.g. yi- ‘go’, ya- ‘come’, g@ p- ‘run’,
tabu- ‘escape’, posture verbs, e.g. kwa- ‘stay’, r @- ‘sit’, and a few others, such as gra- ‘cry’,
warsam(a)- ‘be angry’, and kawi- ‘come ashore’.
   Over 80 per cent of verbs are S=A ambitransitives, e.g. laku- ‘know, understand’, used
intransitively in 3.1 and transitively in 3.2; other such verbs include k@- ‘consume (food, drink,
smoke)’, j @- ‘chew’, and wuk@- ‘hear, understand’. A few verbs can be used only transitively,
e.g. yi- ‘say, speak’ and kur- ‘do, make, get’.
   As shown in §3.1, an O can be either unmarked for case, or marked with the accusative-
locative -(V)m. The direct object of verbs with somewhat negative overtones takes the dative
marking. This agrees with one of the meanings of the dative case as a ‘maleﬁciary’ marker
(§7.4). For instance, the S=A ambitransitive verb yaga- ‘be scared’ takes the O in dative case,
e.g. kaykak yaga-na (ghost+dat be.scared-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt) ‘she is scared of a ghost’.
In its meaning ‘be worried about someone’, the polysemous verb wuk@- ‘hear, obey, feel, worry’
takes the object in dative, as in 4.11 and 21.19.
4.11 d@-k@-k           wuk@-na-wun
     3masc.sg-obl-dat worry-act.foc-1fem.sgbas.vt
     ‘I am worried about him’
The verb ‘see’ is unusual in the case marking for its O constituent. It is unmarked if the object
seen is indeﬁnite or not completely seen. If the verb has an atelic meaning, ‘see’ (by chance),
the object is in the dative case, as in the ﬁrst line of 4.12. And it is marked with the accusative-
locative if the object is fully seen and the action is telic, rather than atelic—that is, if the verb
v@- means ‘look’, as in the second line of 4.12. (The accusative-locative case marks the object
of this verb in its newly acquired meaning ‘read’: see §21.1.2.)
4.12 [br@-k@-k      v@-tu@-k]          [wun-a:m       v@-ku]         [ata wa-b@r]
     3du-obl-dat see-1sg-compl.ds I-lk+acc/loc see-compl.ss thus say-3dubas.p
     ‘After I’d seen the two of them, having looked on and on (lit. going) at me, they said thus’
   Strictly transitive and ambitransitive verbs diﬀer from intransitive verbs in their derivational
possibilities. Intransitive verbs can form causative compounds with the verb taka- ‘put’ as V2
(see §15.3.1 on its applicative-like meaning). The preﬁx kay- (limited in productivity) derives a
strictly transitive verb from an intransitive verb, e.g. wiy- ‘be broken’, kay-wiy- ‘break by hand,
e.g. nuts’. If used with an ambitransitive verb, kay- has a diﬀerent eﬀect—for instance, it may
imply a special eﬀort or an unusually large object, e.g. tapu- ‘hold, carry’, kay-tapu- ‘hold, carry
(an unusually large bundle)’ (see §16.2). Most verbs derived with the preﬁx kay-, or causatives
with wa- ‘say’ as V1 are strictly transitive, e.g. kay-napwi- ‘unwrap (e.g. a parcel)’, kay-puti-
‘take oﬀ’ (see §15.3.2 and §16.2.1 for further discussion).
   Verbs of speech, perception, and giving, and most intransitive verbs (e.g. ‘die’ or ‘stand up’),
diﬀer from other verbs in terms of (a) whether they combine with directional markers at all,
and (b) what the semantic eﬀects are—see §16.1.
   Verbs which are both S=A and S=O ambitransitives include all the generic verbs (§§21.1–3),
t@ p- ‘close’, kaykwa- ‘spill something intentionally (transitive); capsize (intransitive)’, wuka-
‘drop or spill unintentionally; fall’, wula- ‘enter; make enter’, s@luku- ‘forget something; be
forgotten’, gwaj- ‘turn (the handle); turn (by itself)’, rali- ‘untie something; untie (by itself)’,
kus@- ‘ﬁnish’ (4.13–14).

     ‘We have ﬁnished it (a long story)’The verb kus@- is used intransitively as a euphemism in lieu of ‘die’, with a human subject.
   An ambitransitive verb may have somewhat diﬀerent meanings when used transitively and
when used intransitively: transitive kaja- means ‘open by moving apart (legs, book), move (e.g.
ﬁngers)’; the same verb used intransitively means ‘disperse’. The transitive verb wapa- means
‘leave, abandon’; the same verb used intransitively means ‘be full, not want any more’, as in
ya:l wapa-na (belly leave/be.full-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt) ‘he was full’.
   The class of S=O ambitransitives appears to be expanding. Transitive verbs such as kasapwi-
‘open ‘ and yi-pa:kw- ‘hide’ are used intransitively by innovative speakers, much to the annoy-
ance of the traditionalists. A form yi-pa:kw@-d (go-hide-3masc.sgbas.p) normally means ‘he
hid (something)’; whereas for innovative speakers it can also mean ‘he became hidden’. An
intransitive verb can occasionally be used transitively: kiya- ‘die’ was used to mean ‘kill’ in an
angry outcry at a misbehaving child:4.15 ka-l                              kiya-kiya-k@-tua-ñ@n-@k
     dem.prox+fem.sg-3fem.sgnom die-die-fut-1sgsubj.vt-2fem.sgbas.vt-conf
     ‘This one! I will well and truly kill you!’   Extended intransitives form a small subclass of intransitive verbs. These have an obligatory
second argument which is unmarked for case and cannot be cross-referenced on the verb. One
such verb, patiaku- ‘turn into (something)’, was illustrated in 3.10. The second argument can
be obligatory; for instance, yaku- ‘wash’ is typically used with the unmarked instrumental
argument gu ‘water’, as in gu yaku-na-wun (water wash-act.foc-1sgbas.vt) ‘I wash, bathe’ (lit.
‘I wash (with water)’). Or it can be optional, as is the case with wapruku- ‘be overﬂowing’:
this verb can be used intransitively, as in ya:l bu wapruku-na (belly already be.overﬂowing-
act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt) ‘(I am) very full, lit. belly is already overﬂowing’; or with an unmarked
instrument, as in 3.11 (‘overﬂowing with money’).
   Ditransitive verbs are a small class which includes wa- ‘say, tell’, s@maka- ‘show’, yapi- ‘buy,
sell, pay’, kalipa- ‘learn, teach’, and a loan verb sali- ‘send’ (from Tok Pisin salim ‘send’), the
third argument being recipient. The verb taka- ‘put’ has a location as a third argument. All of
these except ‘show’ and ‘put’ can be used as transitives and as A=S ambitransitives. The verb
wa- ‘say’ has the speech content (as object) and the recipient as its arguments. It can be used
transitively, with just the recipient as the second argument. If the speech content is a direct
speech report, it cannot be cross-referenced. Direct speech report constructions are discussed
in §19.5. The verb ‘give’ is a class of its own, both in terms of form and of semantics. See C
below.
   Transitivity of verbs is neutralized in what look like complex sentences consisting of a verb
in the completive, cotemporaneous, or manner sequencing form and one of the three polyfunc-
tional verbs (t@- ‘stand’, r @- ‘sit’, kwa- ‘stay’, also used as positional verbs); see §17.5. Pervasive
use of sequencing constructions with a copula where the verb’s transitivity is neutralized may
be one of the reasons why the class of S=O ambitransitives is currently expanding.
                                                                                   4.2 Verbs       81B. Polyfunctional Verbs: copula verbs, support verbs, and auxiliaries
Manambu has ten verbs which can each be used in two or three of the following functions—as
copula verbs, as support verbs, and also as auxiliaries. Five of them are also used as lexical
verbs. A summary of these verbs and their functions is in Table 4.1.
   When used as copula verbs, they head the predicate of copula clauses which involve two
arguments but cannot be considered either transitive or intransitive (see Dixon 2002b for
a typological overview of copulas, and §20.1.3). In Manambu, the relationship between the
two arguments of a copula clause—the copula subject and the copula complement—covers
identity, attribution, location, and possession. Their choice depends (a) on the meaning of the
copula construction, and (b) on the semantic type of copula complement. Further meanings
typically associated with copula clauses can also be expressed with verbless clauses or non-
verbal predicate heads—we return to this in §20.1.3.
   When these polyfunctional verbs occur as auxiliaries in complex predicates, they impart
an aspect or modality speciﬁcation to the whole construction, and take further tense, aspect,
mood, and modality inﬂections (see §§17.1–4).
   Some also occur as support verbs with uninﬂected verbs, carrying tense, aspect, mood,
and modality inﬂections. Such uninﬂected verbs include completive, completive-intensive, and
customary aspects, desiderative and frustrative modality, and a few other categories detailed in
Table 11.1. Loan verbs typically require a support verb, e.g. stati t@- (start support.verb) ‘start’.
Support verbs are similar to the so-called ‘light verbs’ (see a deﬁnition in Matthews 1997), used
to construct verbal expressions with accompanying nouns or with borrowed verbal roots (see
Haig 2001: 213 on similar use of ‘do’ in Kurmanjî and Zazaki, both Iranian). See §17.2 for
details. In addition, some polyfunctional verbs appear in lexicalized complex predicates—see
§17.3.
   Five of the polyfunctional verbs can also be used as independent lexical verbs. These are
positional verbs ‘stand’, ‘sit’, and ‘stay’, and the verbs kur- ‘do, take, get’ and yi- ‘say; go’.
These have a full range of grammatical forms including imperatives. The other ﬁve verbs do
not have a full range of grammatical forms—for instance, they cannot form imperatives.
   Each of the ten verbs featured in Table 4.1 can be considered polysemous and multifunc-
tional. The regularity of their multiple functions points towards the appropriateness of a
polysemy, rather than a homonymy, analysis. But can we decide which of the uses is primary?
We address this issue in §17.2.
   When these verbs are employed as copula verbs, their copula subject shares all syntactic and
morphological properties with subjects (A/S) of other sorts, including cross-referencing on the
verb and case marking. It behaves like an S in terms of its ability to control agreement with the
‘reactivated topic’ deictic marker (operating on an S/O basis)—see §3.3. Copula complements
are diﬀerent from any other argument in that they (i) never take any case marking and (ii)
are never cross-referenced on the verb (see §7.2). All copula clauses show the expected rela-
tional meanings—identity, attribution, and location. One copula (t@-) is also used to express
possession and ‘becoming’. See discussion below.
   The verbs na- ‘be (of physical states; natural phenomena)’, tay- ‘be (of climatic states)’, yasa-/
yas@- ‘be (of physical states, e.g. hunger, thirst)’, say- ‘be (of some states, e.g. shame)’, and yæy-
‘be (of smells)’ occur with a restricted set of formally unmarked nouns or nominals, and can be
interpreted in either of two ways. They may be viewed either as copula existential verbs with the
corresponding nouns and nominals in the copula complement (CC) slot, or as support verbs
for such nouns and nominals. We can recall, from §4.1.2, that many nominals can only occur
as CC of such verbs. The copulas na-, tay-, and yasa-/yas@- allow the option of having a zero

                                                                                 4.2 Verbs       83subject cross-referenced with 3fem.sg (formally and functionally unmarked: §5.2.3). We return
to these in §17.2.
   A nominal part of the predicate containing a support verb shares morphological and syn-
tactic properties with copula complements. Both are formally unmarked, cannot be negated or
questioned separately from the verb they precede, and have a ﬁxed position in a clause (they
can only be separated from it by the connective ata or the reactivated topic demonstratives).
   The major diﬀerence is semantic: when used as copula verbs, the multifunctional verbs listed
in Table 4.1 reﬂect one or more of the relational meanings typically associated with copula
clauses (see §20.1.3 and Dixon 2002b). When used as support verbs, they are eﬀectively mere
‘placeholders’ for the inﬂectional categories which cannot be expressed otherwise.
   The verbs listed under 6–10 can be seen as primarily support verbs with a strong semantic
and partially syntactic similarity to existential copulas. A broken line separating columns 2 and
3 for these verbs in Table 4.1 reﬂects this indeterminacy in their status.
   We will now discuss the polyfunctional verbs in Table 4.1 one by one.
1. The copula t@- in the meaning of ‘become’ was illustrated in 3.8–9. It is used as a support
verb with uninﬂected frustratives in 4.9–10. It can also be used as an existential verb as
illustrated in 4.16–17; then it occurs with either a locative, or a reactivated topic demonstrative.
4.16 al@k        apaw@l k@ta b@um          t@-na-di
     this.is.why spirit now haze+loc stay-act.foc-3plbas.vt
     ‘This is why spirits are now staying in a haze’ (and are invisible to us)
4.17 kayik        ada                              t@-na-d
     ghost/spirit dem.dist.react.top.masc.sg stand-act.foc-3masc.sgbas.vt
     ‘The ghost is (there)!’ (said, in fear, by Tanina, then 8 years of age)
   The verb t@- can also be used in the meaning of ‘have’, as in 4.18. Its second argument is
similar to the copula complement in that it is not cross-referenced on the verb. If a reactivated
topic demonstrative occurs in such a construction, it agrees in gender and number with the
subject of t@- and not with the possessed entity. This indicates that the subject of t@- behaves
like an intransitive subject (S) no matter whether the verb is used with one argument, or with
two.
4.18 n@ma       kabak            adika                     t@-na-di
     big+fem.sg money(lit.stone) dem.dist.react.top+plural have-act.foc-3plbas.vt
     ‘Now they (mentioned again) have a lot of money’
  The verb t@- also occurs in idiomatic collocations. When preceded by a body part noun in
dative case it refers to something wrong with this particular body part, e.g. ab-a:k t@- (head-
lk+dat be/stand/have) ‘be not quite right in one’s head’ (see §17.2.3).
2. The copula r @- ‘sit’ can be used as an existential verb; then it requires either a locative or a
reactivated topic demonstrative (just like the copula t@-), as in 4.19.
4.19 mak@n      r@-na                       væk aka
     mourning sit-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt pan dem.dist.react.top.fem.sg
     r@-na
     sit-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt
     ‘The pan “in mourning” (that is, a pan with a string of black wool on it) is (here)!’
This same verb also means ‘sit’, e.g. t@k@r -@-m r @-k-na-wun (stool-lk-loc sit-fut-act.foc-
1fem.sgbas.vt) ‘I will sit on a stool’.
84     4 Word Classes   The choice between t@- and r @- as existential verbs is partly determined by the nature of
the copula subject. Similarly to many languages of Papua New Guinea (see Aikhenvald 2000:
166–9 for an overview), the verb t@- ‘stand’ is used with referents which are prototypically
vertical—humans, spirits, animate beings, and trees. The verb r @- ‘sit’ is used with large, squat,
inanimate referents, such as ‘pan’ in 4.19. This is reminiscent of classiﬁcatory verbs—see §17.2.3
for arguments against the analysis of Manambu copula as purely classiﬁcatory. The verb t@-
can optionally replace r @- as an existential. Both t@- and r @- have one suppletive imperative
ada.
   The copula r@- ‘sit’ can take the adjective yara ‘well’ as its copula complement, e.g. yara r@-
na-wun ‘I am ﬁne’; as well as a number of nouns marked with the locative case, e.g. stua-m r@-
(store-loc sit) ‘be for sale in a store’ (see §17.2.3).
3. The copula kwa- ‘stay’ is used with some adjectives and nouns as copula complement, e.g.
yara ‘well’, as in 4.20, an answer to a conventional question ‘are you ﬁne’? The use of kwa- as
an auxiliary is discussed in §17.2.1; its use in lexicalized complex verbs is addressed in §17.3.
4.20 yara kwa-na-wun
     well stay-act.foc-1fem.sgbas.vt
     ‘I am ﬁne’
4. The copula yi- occurs with a few abstract nouns, such as suan ‘diﬃcult’ in 4.7 and 13.80,
and some onomatopoeic-like expressions, e.g. kr@sakr@s (scratchy) in 4.21. Similarly to the
polyfunctional verbs discussed so far, yi- can be interpreted as a support verb as well as an
existential copula. Unlike the verbs under 6–10 below, yi-can also be used as an open-class
verb.
4.21 wun-a kwa:l kr@sakr@s yi-na
     I-lk throat ‘scratchy’ be-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt
     ‘My throat is scratchy’
   This same verb is used with the nominal s@kul@k ‘cooking’ to mean ‘cook’. This construction
can be used without a second argument (‘do the cooking’) or with a second argument (‘cook
something’). However, just as with the verb t@- in the meaning ‘have’, this second argument is
not an object: it cannot be cross-referenced or referred to with the reactivated topic demon-
strative.
   The verb yi- in combination with kwas@k (possibly, a dative case form of the adjective kwasa
‘small’) means ‘be unwilling to do something, or be tired of someone or something’ (kwas@k
can be replaced by Tok Pisin les, as in 22.35). It takes an additional, non-O, NP argument in
the dative case, as in 4.22. Or it can occur with a postposed irrealis complement clause, as in
13.81. This behaviour is somewhat unusual in Manambu (where the matrix verb tends to be
sentence ﬁnal: see §20.2 on discourse motivations for the constituent order).
4.22 l@-k@-k           kwas@k yi-na-wun
     3fem.sg-obl-dat unwilling be-act.foc-1fem.sgbas.vt
     ‘I am fed up with her’
   The copula yi- has the same form as the intransitive verb yi- ‘go’ and the transitive verb yi-
‘say, speak’ (see §21.1.3 on the syntactic diﬀerences between speech verbs in Manambu). These
three verbs share all forms, except the imperative: as we will see in §13.1, the verb ‘go’ has a
suppletive imperative ma:y, while the verb ‘say’ and the copula share a regular imperative a-y.
Given that, cross-linguistically, the verb ‘say’ often becomes a copula, we hypothesize that the
                                                                                 4.2 Verbs       85two could be linked in Manambu. The component yi- as V1 in a few compound verbs (§15.2.3),
e.g. yi-pa:kw- ‘hide something’ (where pa:kw- means ‘be hidden’), is also likely to be connected
to the verb ‘say’.
5. The verb kur- occurs as a copula verb in the meaning of ‘become fully, reach, arrive to be
something’, as in 4.23. Its copula complement is always a noun.
4.23 du-a-ñan      ata kur@-d
     man-lk-child then become.fully-3masc.sgbas.p
     ‘He then reached the stage of being a boy’
This verb is also used as a transitive lexical verb meaning ‘do, make, get, take, procure’, e.g.
yawi kur- (work do-) ‘work, do a job’. With a same-subject purposive lexical verb, it forms an
imminent construction, ‘be about to’ (§17.1.2), as in kiya-k kur- (die-purp.ss do/get-) ‘be about
to die’.
As mentioned above, the remaining ﬁve verbs are inherently ambiguous in their status: they
can be equally well interpreted either as existential verbs, or as support verbs each used with a
limited number of nominals. For each of these, the ‘experiencer’ can be optionally added; this
is why it is in brackets. Without the overt subject, 4.24 means ‘it is hot’ (in general); 4.25 means
‘it is cold’ (in general), and examples at 4.26 refer to an unspeciﬁed experiencer (also see §17.2).
6. The copula or support verb na- takes physical states, natural phenomena, ideophones, and
expressives as its complements (also see 4.81).
4.24 (wun) bwiyabwi na-na
     (I)      hot        be:nat-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt
     ‘It is hot’, ‘I am hot’
7. The copula or support verb tay- occurs with nouns which refer to climatic states:
4.25 (wun) n@k@r tay-na
     (I)      cold be:clim-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt
     ‘It is cold’, ‘I am cold’
8. The copula or support verb yas@-/yasa- occurs with nouns referring to physical states and
desires. These include ka:m ‘hunger’, gu ‘water’, and kwa:l ‘neck’ (Yuanab dialect) meaning
‘feel thirsty’, s@ ‘sleep’, wus ‘urine’, di ‘shit’, and ñiki ‘blood’ (for ‘feeling reckless’).
4.26a (wun) ka:m yas@-na
      (I)    hunger be:desire-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt
      ‘I am hungry’
  Unlike any other polyfunctional verb, it can occur with purposive and desiderative verbs:
4.26b (wun) yaki      k@-k@r     yas@-na
      (I)    tobacco consume-des be:desire-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt
      ‘I want to smoke’
4.26c (l@) kur@-k        yas@-na
      (she) do-purp.ss be:desire-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt
      ‘She is displaying signs of having sexual desire’
4.26d kiyak        ñiki yas@-na
      die+purp.ss blood be:desire-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt
      ‘Do you feel reckless enough to be going to die?’
86        4 Word Classes     The subject properties of experiencer in such constructions are discussed in §20.1.4.
9. The copula or support verb say- occurs with nouns referring to two mental and physical
states—‘shame’ and ‘pins and needles’:
4.27 wap      say-na-wun
     shame be:feel-act.foc-1fem.sgbas.vt
     ‘I feel ashamed’
10. The copula or support verb yæy- occurs with ‘smell’. The source of smell (e.g. ﬂower) can
be optionally speciﬁed; otherwise the construction can have a generic reference: ‘there is a
smell’.
4.28 (maway) ya:m yæy-na
     (ﬂower) smell be-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt
     ‘There is a smell (of a ﬂower)’
  The polyfunctionality of the copula, support, and auxiliary verbs is in line with a few
other verbs with generic and abstract meanings (but without copular functions). These include
s@- ‘call, make’, ka- ‘take’, ku- ‘put, do’, and also the general ‘replacement’ verb m@gi- ‘do
whatever’. Many of these take part in forming lexicalized complex predicates—see §17.3.
C. The Verb ‘Give’ forms a subclass on its own. This strictly ditransitive verb has two stem
forms whose choice depends on the person of the recipient. A few languages across the world,
including some from Papua New Guinea (mostly, but not exclusively, the Highlands: Comrie
2003), display a similar pattern.
   If the recipient is ﬁrst or second person (any number or gender), the form is kwatiya-, e.g.
m@n-a:k kwatiya-k@-tua (you.masc-lk+dat give.to.nonthird.p-fut-2sgsubj.vt+3fem.sgbas.vt)
‘I will give you this (thing)’. The stem alternant in the imperative and the non-future negative
is kwata:y or kw@ta:y, e.g. wun-a:k a-kwata:y! (I-lk+dat impv-give.to.nonthird.p) ‘give (some-
thing) to me’ (see §11.3.2). A ﬁrst person dual recipient is illustrated in 4.29:
4.29 [ña-n@       k@-kwa-gura-di                 bal] an-a:k
     day+lk-day eat-hab-2plsubj.vt-3plbas.vt pig 1du-lk+dat
     kwatiya-kwa-na-digwur-@k?
     give.to.nonthird.p-hab-act.foc-2plbas.vt-conf
     ‘The pigs you eat day in day out, do you give (them) to the two of us?’
   If the recipient is third person, the form is kui-, e.g. l@-k@-k a-kui! (3fem.sg-obl-dat impv-
give.to.third.p) ‘give to her’, and 4.30. The stem alternant in the non-future negative is kwa:y,
e.g. ma: kwa:y ‘did not give’ (see §11.3.2).
4.30 adiya                   s@b@n@-n kui-da-di                          a-di
     dem.dist.react.top+pl return-seq give.to.third.p-3plsubj.p-3plbas.p dem.dist-pl
     kamna:gw
     food
     ‘They gave these types of food back (to them)’
  The form kui- ‘give to third person recipient’ can be considered functionally unmarked,
for the following reasons. First, it is consistently used in reciprocal constructions, no matter
what the person of recipient is. In 4.31, the speaker is talking about us giving, or oﬀering, the
mortuary feast to each other; yet, the third person recipient form is used.
                                                                                 4.2 Verbs       874.31 k@k@t@p        awarwa kui-na-bran
     mortuary.feast rec      give.to.third.p-act.foc-1dubas.vt
     ‘We give the mortuary feast to each other’
   Secondly, the third person recipient form is used for recipients in general, in the meaning of
‘giving away’, as in 4.32.
4.32 a-b@r        marasin kui-kwa-na-b@r                           kui-ta:y
     dem.dist-du medicine give.to.third.p-hab-act.foc-3dubas.vt give.to.third.p-cotemp
     ‘They used to give medicine (to people), giving (and giving)’
  A third person recipient form is used in generic statements, even if these obviously include a
non-third person. Eight-year-old Tanina was worried about me not eating the banana I was
given, and giving everything away instead. She was sitting next to me, and I had oﬀered
the banana to her. That is, by using kui- in 4.33, she had subsumed herself (ﬁrst person)
under a generic set of recipients covered by this form. (Syntactically, this is an example of a
desubordinated cotemporaneous clause: see §19.9.) A similar example is in T2.1.
4.33 Sasa kur-ta:y       kui-ta:y               kur-ta:y   kui-ta:y
     Sasha get-cotemp give.to.third.p-cotemp get-cotemp give.to.third.p-cotemp
     ‘Sasha (keeps) getting (things) (and) giving (them away), getting (things) (and) giving
     (them away)’
Thirdly, the form kui- is the one that occurs in verb compounded structures whose meaning
is only partially predictable, e.g. kui-taka- (give.to.third.p-put-) ‘send, give away (e.g. money)’,
kui-tay-taya-n (give.to.third.p-to.side-to.side-seq) ‘give back and forth (e.g. in a situation of
exchange)’. This same form also occurs in idiomatic collocations, e.g. mawul n@ma kui- (inside
big+fem.sg give.to.third.p-) ‘be happy’, and s@p kui- (skin give.to.third.p-) ‘get used to’.
   In spontaneous speech, many speakers employ kui- for a non-third person recipient, where
one would expect kwatiya-. Teketay is a very lively story teller and a gifted natural linguist. She
used kui- and kwatiya- for non-third person interchangeably, as shown in 4.34. The ‘aberrant’
use of kui- is underlined.
4.34 ka-di t@p          a-di       jap@-wa         kur-ku       ya-ku,
     sow-pl coconut dem.dist-pl thing+lk-com get-compl.ss come-compl.ss
     ñan-a-k         kui-ku,               k@                 ñan ata
     we.pl-lk-dat give.to.third.p-compl.ss dem.prox+fem.sg child then
     kur-k-ñ@na
     get-fut-2fem.sgsubj.vt+3fem.sgbas.vt
     ‘Having got these coconuts with those things, having come, having given to us, then you
     will get this child’
  Later in the same story, she used kwatiya- for a ﬁrst person recipient (4.35), and then, a few
sentences later in the same story, she used kui-, for the same recipient (4.36):
4.35 wun kwatiya                      ma: [Pause] k@              ñan
     I    give.to.nonthird.p:neg neg              dem.prox+fem.sg child
     ‘I won’t give (you), this child’
4.36 ñan k@                   ñan, kui            ma:, ñ@n-a:k
     we dem.prox+fem.sg child give.to.third.p:neg neg, you.fem-lk+dat
     ‘We won’t give this child, to you’
88        4 Word Classes   Similar examples are not infrequent (see, e.g. 13.50). However, it is notable that the form
kwatiya- is hardly ever used instead of kui-. We can hypothesize that a tendency to replace the
restricted and functionally marked form kwatiya- ‘give to non-third person’ with a more widely
used and functionally unmarked form kui- ‘give to third person’ is indicative of the incipient
breakdown of the system, ultimately increasing the overall frequency of the functionally
unmarked kui- over kwatiya-, which is more restricted in the contexts in which it occurs.
   Comparative evidence, from other languages of the Ndu family, does not fully support this.
The only other language in the family with a distinction between ‘give to third person’ and ‘give
to non-third person’ is the Abelam-Wosera dialect complex. 4 The Proto-Ndu form for ‘give’ is
∗
  kwa(:)y/kw@y.
   The two forms in Abelam-Wosera are: tiyaa ‘give to non-third person’ and kwayee ‘give to
third person’. The Manambu kui- (negative kwa:y) and the Abelam kwayé ‘give to third person’
are reﬂexes of the Proto-Ndu ‘give’, while the Manambu kwatiya- (negative and imperative
(-)kwata:y) can be interpreted as a combination of kwa(y) ‘give’ and the cognate of Abelam
tiyaa ‘give to non-third person’. That is, the Manambu ‘give to non-third person’ goes back
to a compound verb. The component -tiya in kwatiya- is likely to be an archaic cognate
between Manambu and Abelam-Wosera, lost from other Ndu languages. Sound correspon-
dences between Manambu and Abelam-Wosera support this, making it unlikely for this form
to be a borrowing. (We saw in Chapter 1 that there is a certain amount of trade contact between
the Manambu and the Wosera people through barter markets; there is hardly any bilingualism,
or any substantial linguistic contact.) However, the compound itself can be interpreted as a
Manambu innovation. That some people still prefer to replace the new formation kwatiya-
with the old form kui- may reﬂect the fact that this innovation is not yet fully established in
the language. An additional complicating factor in the ‘acceptance’ of this innovation is the
lack of support from neighbouring languages with which Manambu is, or has been, in trade
or other contact in recent times: neither Iatmul (also Ndu) nor Kwoma-Washkuk (which is
not demonstrably related to Ndu languages) distinguish the third–non-third recipient forms of
‘give’. Iatmul has one form kwi- ‘give’ (Staalsen and Staalsen 1973), which is a direct reﬂex of
Proto-Ndu ∗ kw@y, while Kwoma has a form ha (Bowden 1997).
   The form kui- is unusual and perhaps archaic in one additional way. Unlike other verbs
in the language, it does not have to take the suﬃx -kwa- ‘habitual’ in the negative form. As
we will see in §12.3, the habitual aspect marked with -kwa- is likely to be the result of recent
grammaticalization of the verb kwa- ‘stay’. Two options are thus available for ‘give’ in past
habitual; there is no semantic diﬀerence between the two. The regular form, kui-kwa- ‘(not)
give habitually’, is shown in 4.37.4.37 d@-k@-k     sa:n     ak@s    kui-kwa-na-d
     he-obl-dat money neg.hab give.to.third.p-hab-act.foc-3masc.sgbas.vt
     ‘He never used to give him money; he never gave him money’     The non-habitual declarative form, kui-, with the habitual negator ak@s is shown in 4.38:4.38 ak@s     kui-l                         ka:b yiyi        ta:l
     neg.hab give.to.third.p-3fem.sgbas.p selﬁsh aux:red stay+3fem.sgbas.p
     ‘(She was bad), she never gave (children anything), she was selﬁsh’   4 Laycock (1965: 166) did not register the distinction of the two forms for ‘give’ in Manambu. The Abelam-Wosera
tiya form is erroneously interpreted as ‘give to me’, while the form kway is said to be used with second person recipient.
This goes against all other sources for Abelam-Wosera (e.g. Kundama, Wilson, and Sapai 1987).
                                                                                   4.2 Verbs       89  The other verb, kwatiya- ‘give to non-third person’, is always marked with -kwa- in habitual
negative constructions, as in:
4.39 brak       ak@s     kwatiya-kwa-na-d@wun
     2du+dat neg.hab give.to.nonthird.p-hab-act.foc-1masc.sgbas.vt
     ‘I never give you two (anything)’
  If indeed the original compound form kwatiya- is a recent innovation, its grammatical
regularity in the formation of the negative habitual (in itself, a recent form) conﬁrms its recent
origin.
D. Meteorological Verbs are a small subclass. They take one obligatory argument—the
weather or time condition in the subject slot. Two verbs unequivocally belong to this class:
ja- ‘rain’, used exclusively with the subject wa:l ‘rain’, and va- ‘fall (night)’, used only with ga:n
‘night’, as in 4.40–1:
4.40 wa:l ja-na
     rain be.rain-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt
     ‘It is raining’
4.41 ga:n aka                        va-na
     night dem.dist.react.top.fem.sg fall:night-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt
     ‘It was getting dark’
The subject ga:n ‘night’ controls gender agreement with the reactivated topic demonstrative in
4.41; this shows that it behaves like an intransitive subject (S). We will see in §5.2.1 that nouns
referring to time are normally feminine. These verbs cannot take any cross-referencing other
than third person; neither can they occur in imperative, form part of any verbal compound, or
take a directional suﬃx.
   They can cross-reference time, location, or manner if it is topical, in the second cross-
referencing position, as in 4.42:
4.42 n@ma        wa:l ja-la                                  s@k@r
     big+fem.sg rain be.rain-3fem.sgsubj.vt+3fem.sgbas.vt+lk time
     ‘time when big rain fell’
  The verb ja- is not used in any other context; unlike va- which also occurs in an idiomatic
collocation agur va- ‘snore’. Whether or not it is the same va- is an open question.
  The verb kus@- meaning ‘ﬁnish, end’ is an S=A and S=O ambitransitive (see 4.13–14, and
4.8). When used with ga:n ‘night’ in the subject slot, it means ‘completely fall (of night)’:
4.43 ga:n b@          kus@-na
     night already ﬁnish-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt
     ‘It is dark, the night has completely fallen’
   In some ways it behaves similarly to the two meteorological verbs when used in this context—
it cannot form an imperative, or be used with a non-third person subject. Unlike meteorological
verbs, it can combine with the verb -ya- ‘come’ in V2 slot, conveying the meaning of a prolonged
gradual process, as in 4.44:
4.44 ga:n b@          kus@-ya-na
     night already ﬁnish-come-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt
     ‘It is slowly and gradually getting dark’
90        4 Word Classes  This is a slightly unusual meaning of a -ya- compound (see §15.3.1): these typically refer
to durative action. It is not clear whether the two meanings of the verb kus@- are an instance
of polysemy or of homonymy. Only comparative evidence (hitherto unavailable) may help us
make an informed decision.
E. Complex Verbs consist of a non-verbal component (typically, a noun referring to a body
part or a state) and a lexical verb. Many such verbs describe a physical condition, e.g. 4.45:
4.45 s@p ji-na
     skin be.tired-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt
     ‘(I, or another person) am/is/are tired’
   Some complex verbs contain an adverb. e.g. bas s@- (ﬁrst plant-) ‘ask’, or a component not
used anywhere else, e.g. luku kur- (? do-) ‘steal’. Some of the verbs in such constructions are not
used anywhere else, e.g. ji- ‘be tired’. Others are, e.g. s@ ‘plant’ in bas s@ ‘ask’, ga:m s@ ‘serenade,
shout’, or kwa- ‘stay’ in s@ kwa- (sleep stay) ‘be asleep, sleep’. See §17.3. Complex verbs which
involve body parts allow variation in their cross-referencing. An alternative to 4.45, ‘skin is
tired’, is 4.46:
4.46 s@p ji-na-wun
     skin be.tired-act.foc-1fem.sgbas.vt
     ‘I am tired’ (lit. skin I-am-tired)
The semantic motivation for this is similar to that in copula clauses involving physical states
like cold or hunger (§17.4): the subject is likelier to be cross-referenced if it is focused—if I am
really insistent about the fact that I am fed up and can’t take any of it any longer, I am likelier
to use the second construction. No such option is available for complex verbs which do not
contain a body part term, e.g. s@ kwa- ‘sleep’ (see §17.4 and §20.1.4).
The last issue to be addressed in this section is the multiple class membership for two types
of derived verbal forms: reduplicated forms and customary activity forms with the suﬃx
-j@b@r . These can occur either as copula complements, or nominal parts of complex predicates
with support verbs, or as inﬂected verbs. (We can recall, from B above, that a non-verbal part
of a predicate with a support verb is morphologically and syntactically similar to a copula
complement.) The reduplicated form r@p@r@p ‘equal, identical’ (reduplicated form of r@p ‘be
enough’) is a copula complement in 4.47 (see §6.2.3 on this construction type called ‘argument
elaboration construction’, or ‘inclusory construction’).
4.47 Yuakalu-wa nabi r@p@r@p               t@-na-bran
     Yuakalu-com year be.enough:red have/be-act.foc-1dubas.vt
     ‘Yuakalu and I are the same age’ (lit: ‘with Yuakalu we two are same age’)
     In 4.48, r@p@r@p ‘equal, identical’ is an inﬂected verb:
4.48 mutam r@p@r@p-na-b@rb@r
     face    be.enough:red-act.foc-2dubas.vt
     ‘You two look the same’ (lit. ‘you are same face-wise’)
 In addition, reduplicated forms of stative verbs can modify a nominal in the copula comple-
ment slot, as in 4.49.
4.49 r@p@r@p         kwa:m t@-na-b@r
     be.enough:red crazy have/be-act.foc-3dubas.vt
     ‘They two are equally crazy’ (talking about two children shouting like mad)
                                                                             4.3 Adjectives      91   In 12.17 and 12.33–4, a verb inﬂected with -j@b@r ‘customary aspect’ requires a support verb
t@-, while in 12.37–9 it is an inﬂected verb. There is no meaning diﬀerence between these two.
It appears, however, that innovative speakers are more likely to treat these forms as inﬂecting
verbs than traditional speakers. As the language evolves, this may result in the expansion of the
class of inﬂecting verbs. Interestingly, this development does not aﬀect modal forms (the two
frustratives and the desiderative) which never take any verbal cross-referencing markers and
always occur as copula complements if tense needs to be expressed (see the end of §4.1.2).
                                       4.3 a d j e c t i v e sAdjectives fall into two classes: a small class of three underived ‘agreeing’ adjectives, two of
which refer to dimension, and one to value; and a smallish semi-open class of about sixteen
‘non-agreeing’ adjectives some of which are derived. These cover value, dimension, age, and
colour.","[105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 110, 111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118]"
"22.7 [Yawabak t@p        r@-bana                         k@ka]                   [tasol

     ‘If it is the second one (second child), this is no good (ﬁrst child is more important)’  The language-internal motivation behind this is that the few connectives Manambu has
occupy exactly the same position. The same applies to nau ‘then’ which occurs in the same
place in Manambu clauses as it does in the Tok Pisin spoken by the Manambu. This clause-
chaining insert accompanies the sequencing marker, and nau forms one phonological word
with the verb:22.9 [Ya-tataka-nau]    ata wa-di
     come-imm.seq-then then say-3plbas.p
     ‘On having come, they then said’  Within a noun phrase, non-agreeing adjectives of Tok Pisin extraction occupy the same place
as they would in Tok Pisin, and in Manambu, as shown in 22.17, and 22.10.22.10 a    liklik ma:j wa-k@-tua
      then little story say-fut-1sgsubj.vt+3fem.sgbas.vt
      ‘Then I will tell a little story’  A Tok Pisin indeﬁnite pronoun sampela ‘some’ or narapela ‘(an)other’ precedes a Tok
Pisin adjective, as would its Manambu equivalent n@k@- ‘(an)other, some’; it also precedes a
Manambu adjective, as in 22.11:
610      22 Genetic and Areal Relationships22.11 narapela ma:j wa-k@-tua                                   sampela kwasa         ma:j
      (an)other story say-fut-1sgsubj.vt+3fem.sgbas.vt some             little+fem.sg story
      ‘I will tell another story, some little story (or other)’
   A quantiﬁer planti ‘many’ precedes the noun, just like its Manambu equivalent samasa:m
(see 22.36); and a quantiﬁer olgeta ‘all’ follows the noun, just like Manambu aba:b ‘all’; 22.12b
was the speaker’s correction of his spontaneous code-switch in 22.12a.
22.12a ñan olgeta atawa kwa-na-dian
       we all       thus stay-act.foc-1plbas.vt
       ‘We all stay like this’
22.12b ñan aba:b atawa kwa-na-dian
       we all       thus stay-act.foc-1plbas.vt
       ‘We all stay like this’
   In all the instances so far, the linear position of a Tok Pisin item was the same as that of its
Manambu counterpart. Not so for the numerals. We can recall, from §10.6.1, that numerals in
Manambu follow the head noun. In Tok Pisin, they precede it. When Tok Pisin wanpela ‘one, a’
appears in Manambu speech, it precedes the noun, following Moravcsik’s predictions that if a
term is borrowed, so is its linear order. Wanpela is quite frequent (and uniformly condemned as
‘bad language’). It appears with Tok Pisin nouns, as in 22.13–14, and with Manambu nouns, as
in 22.15–16 and 21.42 (where wanpela ta:kw (one:tp woman) is repeated as ta:kw nak (woman
one) ).
22.13 gabu-ma:j              ad@ka                          suku-k@-tua-d,

      one/a      village+lk+loc dem.dist-masc.sg village man two stay-3dubas.p
      ‘In a village, in that village, there were two men’
  The Tok Pisin form wanpela precedes any adjective in a noun phrase; it is more often found
with Tok Pisin adjectives than with those from Manambu:
22.17 wanpela liklik ma:j aka                            wa-k@-tua
      one/a       little story dem.dist.react.top.fem.sg say-fut-1sgsubj.vt+3fem.sgbas.vt
      ‘I will tell one little story’
   Occasionally, wanpela and nak ‘one’ occur in one noun phrase, reinforcing each other (as
in 21.42). We return to this in § 22.5.4. In all these instances, wanpela has nothing to do with
counting; it is an indeﬁnite introducer for a new referent. A story in Tok Pisin would start with
                                                22.4 Inﬂuence of Tok Pisin and of English        611wanpela plus a participant—so this use of wanpela in Tok Pisin is an obvious consequence of a
tendency to ‘match genres’ in languages in contact (see Aikhenvald 2006b: 27), that is, sharing
pragmatic patterns and the ways of organizing discourse structures.
  Other borrowed numerals do not behave this way. They always precede foreign nouns, as in
T2.21 and T2.40 tu wik ‘two weeks’ (from English). Code-switching in numbers is considered a
mistake—in T2.40 the speaker corrected himself by saying wik (tp, e) viti ‘two weeks’; in T2.41
he used sande viti ‘two weeks’, lit. ‘two Sundays’.
  If used with a Manambu noun, Tok Pisin numerals typically follow them, just as a Manambu
numeral would, thus going against Moravcsik’s prediction. These numbers are used for count-
ing, and often occur accompanied by Manambu terms, in ‘parallel’ structures:22.18 n@k@-di t@n@b        foa faiv a:li taba:b kwa-na-di
      other-PL household four ﬁve four ﬁve          stay-act.foc-3plbas.vt
      ‘Other (clan) households are four (or) ﬁve, four (or) ﬁve’  English and Tok Pisin terms are often used for numbers bigger than ten (as in T2.65)—see
§22.4.3 below, on the motivation for this.
  The Tok Pisin preposition and adverb wantaim occurs in Manambu as a postposition, replac-
ing the postposition wuk@n ‘together, with’ (see §4.5, and 4.68–9). The postposition wantaim is
used by younger speakers, and is considered highly substandard. An example spontaneously
produced is in 22.19:22.19 m@n-a         wantaim yi-k-na-bran
      you.masc-lk with        go-fut-act.foc-1dubas.vt
      ‘We will go together with you; you and I will go together’  Other numerous code-switches involve pro-clauses, e.g. orait ‘OK’ often used similarly to
Manambu ya:kya ‘OK’ (see §20.4.2) (also see T2.50, T2.60, T2.65), em nau ‘this is it’, and em
tasol ‘this is it, just this’. They are not morphologically or syntactically integrated. The question
about whether they can be assigned to a Manambu word class remains open.
  As we saw at the end of §4.5, the word class assignment for a number of Tok Pisin inserts is
problematic (this may justify considering them as code-switches rather than borrowings). One
such problematic word is the modal mas ‘must’ (from Tok Pisin mas) which—unlike any other
modal—can occur with an imperative-marked verb as in 13.22. Another one is tabu, from Tok
Pisin tambu, ‘be prohibited’. This form never occurs inﬂected. It can head a predicate, as in
22.20:22.20 Apat@pa-wa        g@ñ@r warya-wari tabu
      Avatip+lk-com later ﬁght-red forbidden
      ‘Later on it was forbidden to ﬁght with Avatip’Or it may form one constituent with an inﬂected verb in non-future or in future, in what
superﬁcially looks like a complement clause construction, as in 22.21–2:22.21 abra-wur              b@yib ñan tabu              r@-bana
      dem.dist+du-up stream we forbidden sit-1plsubj.vt+3fem.sgbas.vt
      aka-n-aka
      dem.dist.react.top.fem.sg-pred-react.top.fem.sg
      ‘It is that it is forbidden for us to live (lit. sit) on the two streams up there’
612     22 Genetic and Areal Relationships22.22 [d@yam               vyavi]    [ma]: [wun tabu

      ‘There is no hitting them, it is forbidden for me to hit (them)’ (lit. I am forbidden I will
      hit)
  In terms of its synchronic status, tabu forms a subclass of its own.
  The Tok Pisin completive marker pinis also behaves in an unusual way when it occurs in
Manambu speech. It can head a predicate (and be modiﬁed by olgeta ‘altogether’, also from
Tok Pisin), as in 22.23, or form a whole clause, as in 22.24 (where it is preceded by a pause):
22.23 ata S@ruali pinis olgeta            ata kus@-taka-d
      then Seruali compl altogether then ﬁnish-put-3masc.sgbas.p
      adiya
      dem.dist.react.top+pl
      ‘Then the Seruali (i.e. Gala: see §1.4) ﬁnished altogether. Then he put an end to them’
22.24 ka-n     napa-ku             rap@-da:-l                 pause pinis
      eat-seq compl.vb-compl.ss get.up-3plsubj.p-3fem.sgbas.p       compl
      ‘After they had eaten they got up, and it was all over’
If accompanied by an inﬂected verb, as in 22.25, it may be interpreted as an aspect marker: its
position is the same as that of the Tok Pisin pinis.
22.25 vya-da-k         olgeta         pinis
      hit-3pl-compl.ds altogether compl
      ‘Having completely killed all . . . ’
Mas, tabu, and pinis may be interpreted as tokens of incipient ‘loan’ morphology in Manambu
(see §4.5.6).
   Syntactic and morphological calques from Tok Pisin are diﬃcult to identify because of the
nature of Tok Pisin as a Creole language. Any structural similarity between Tok Pisin and
Manambu may well be due to the indigenous substratum in Tok Pisin itself rather than its
inﬂuence on Manambu. Such similarities include some compounds, e.g. Manambu mæn-ta:b
(leg-hand), Tok Pisin lekhan ‘hands and feet’, the polysemy of Manambu vya- ‘hit, kill’ and
Tok Pisin kilim, and numerous others.
   If the Manambu patterns used by frequent code-switchers into Tok Pisin (most, but not
all, of whom are younger than 40–50) diﬀer from those employed by traditional speakers and
display striking structural similarity to Tok Pisin, we can suspect that calquing is at work. For
instance, code-switchers tend to use the postposition wuk@n in many contexts where a comita-
tive would be expected (see §7.9), and even replace it with wantaim (see above). This reﬂects a
tendency towards analytic constructions possibly developed under Tok Pisin inﬂuence. Code-
switchers display more frequent verb-medial order than traditional speakers, which may again
be due to the Tok Pisin inﬂuence (traditional speakers have a pronounced verb-ﬁnal tendency
in their constituent order).
   The more Tok Pisin the person uses, the more impoverished their Manambu sounds—such
speakers would prefer series of juxtaposed clauses to clause chains (see Chapters 18–19), and
would rarely use certain clause-chaining markers, such as -taka ‘immediate sequence’. This
takes us to the issue of incipient language obsolescence—taken up in §22.6.1.
                                              22.4 Inﬂuence of Tok Pisin and of English         613                   22.4.3 Functions of code-switches and borrowingsWhen children and teenagers speak among themselves, they use hardly any Manambu. Some
use Manambu to talk to their parents, and some to talk to their grandparents. In actual fact,
however, a lot of parent–child communication involves Tok Pisin, or even English. Typical
examples include 21.22 and 17.26b. Similar examples are 22.26–8. In these cases, the most
topical NP is in Tok Pisin—this goes together with Tok Pisin used as a way of getting the child
to do things. Tok Pisin inserts are in italics both in Manambu and in the English translations:
22.26 nem bilong yu aw
      name of      you impv+speak
      ‘Say your name!’
22.27 dan             ada   long graun
      go.down+seq sit.impv on ground
      ‘Sit, on the ground!’
22.28 wara bilong yæy                      kus@-k-ñ@na
      water of     paternal.grandmother ﬁnish-irr-2fem.sgsubj.vt+3fem.sgbas.vt
      ‘You might ﬁnish oﬀ granny’s water!’ (a warning not to drink too much)
  All these examples involve commands. This takes us to a major function of Tok Pisin, as a
language of authority. This is also known as ‘directive’ function.
  Consider the following interaction. The mother was getting more and more annoyed with
the little girl trying to pull bits oﬀ the stringbag the mother was knitting. She starts telling her
oﬀ in Manambu (22.29a), and then switches to a mixture of English and Tok Pisin (22.29b):
this makes the threat real and immediate.
22.29a kur-tukwa       da-n      ada
       do-proh.gen go.down-seq sit.impv
       ‘Don’t do (it), sit down’
22.29b naughty yu stupid idiot bai mi pait-im             yu nogut tru
       naughty you stupid idiot fut i hit-trans you bad/strong really
       ‘Naughty, stupid idiot, I will hit you really strongly’
  And the threat was fulﬁlled, too: the mother hit the girl, the girl cried, and the mother
soothed her saying—in Tok Pisin—sori, mi sori. The incident was over. An alternative would
have been for the child to run away; and this was indeed her reaction to her mother’s shouting
the following:
22.30 kal                           kiya-kiya-k@-tua-ñ@n-@k                      nogut mi

      break leg hand of               you
      ‘It is this one, I will kill you, beware I might break your legs and hands’
  The ﬁrst clause is an interesting example of the verb kiya- ‘die’ used transitively meaning
‘make die, kill’. I was told that this usage is not quite grammatical.
  This kind of language socialization is strongly reminiscent of the situation in Gapun village
analysed by Kulick (1987). In both cases, code-switching and language mixing varies depending
on speech genre, and has a special illocutionary force. We will see in §22.6.1 that the sheer
614     22 Genetic and Areal Relationshipsnumber of Tok Pisin inserts may be indicative of the fact that language shift from Manambu
to Tok Pisin and English is imminent.
   English is also in the process of becoming an even stronger ‘power-talk’, especially for
those for whom Tok Pisin is the major language anyway. A group of young boys gathered
around Yuakalu’s house were obviously up to no good. Yuamali went up to them to enquire
about their intentions, and addressed them as ‘Hello boys, what are you doing here?’ The
boys muttered something unintelligible and disappeared. Using English was Yuamali’s way
of asserting her authority over the wayward youngsters. This is very similar to the ways in
which the majority languages—be it Spanish, or Portuguese, or English—are used throughout
the world by minority speakers to claim power over others (see discussion, and references, in
Aikhenvald 2002a: 187–211 and Hill and Hill 1986: 364–86). The motivation for this is fairly
straightforward: speakers of the majority language are the ones in the position of authority,
and so those who speak minority languages employ these same languages to acquire the air of
authority; this may happen consciously, or not.
   Children also code-switch when they talk to adults. A girl was trying to tell a story, and
forgot the name of the main character. In the question addressed to her mother, the possessor
(and the topic) was referred to in Tok Pisin. This agrees with the pattern illustrated in 22.26–8
above—the central, topical constituent, appears in Tok Pisin:22.31 ta:kw-al              l@-k@          t@p-a      s@      Maimwi-al
      woman-3fem.sgnom she-obl+fem.sg village-lk name Maimwi-3fem.sgnom

      man-3masc.sgnom mama village-lk name of            this    man
      ‘There is a woman, her village name is Maimwi, there is a man . . . Mummy, what’s the
      village name of this man?’   But, more often than not, a child would spontaneously address an adult in Tok Pisin. One
girl (11 years of age), herself a highly sophisticated speaker of Manambu, was told to get her
mother’s towel (22.32a), using the Tok Pisin word taul. Her spontaneous reaction was 22.32b;
the mother answered 22.32c (note the English loan beg rather than the Tok Pisin bek):
Mother:
22.32a wun-a        taul akray
       I-lk+fem.sg towel impv+bring
       ‘Bring my towel!’
Daughter:
22.32b i    stap we?
       pred stay where
       ’Where is it?’
Mother:
22.32c wuka                                 bega:m kwa-na

       ‘This here (next to you) is in the bag’   The trigger for the code-switch in this case could be the fact that the mother herself used
a Tok Pisin word (see Clyne 1987, on potential triggers for code-switching). This type of
interaction is highly frequent—and there is always enough Tok Pisin around to provide a
trigger.
                                               22.4 Inﬂuence of Tok Pisin and of English         615  ‘Power-talk’ is not the only function of Tok Pisin: it can be used as a sort of baby talk. All
the children address their mothers and fathers in Tok Pisin (see mama as in 22.31). A speaker
lovingly said to her little niece: sindaun na kaikai ‘sit and eat’. This is also reﬂected in frequent
parallel Manambu–Tok Pisin structures, as shown in 22.33. Here, the mother was trying to
placate a crying baby, and said the same thing twice—in Manambu and in Tok Pisin:
22.33 yata-u          mama i       karim yu
      carry-1sgimpv mama pred carry you
      ‘Shall I carry you? Shall Mummy carry you?’
  In 22.34, another mother was trying to convince her baby to go and wash hands together
with her other children:
22.34 yi-nak       mipela i     was han
      go-1plimpv we        pred wash hand
      ‘Let’s go, we wash hands’
   Speakers have an explanation for this function of Tok Pisin, saying that it is easier than
Manambu for small children. And indeed, the fact is that most children acquire Tok Pisin ﬁrst.
Little Joana (about 3 in 2004) was quite good at Tok Pisin, and did not speak any Manambu
at all. And no wonder: her carers talked to her almost exclusively in Tok Pisin. Her mother
was not concerned about this in the slightest, saying, on various occasions, ‘she will speak, (in)
the village language together with the white people’s language’ (cf. 4.73). We return to this in
§22.6.2.
   Some relatives are always addressed with a Manambu term; then this is like a personal name,
and there is no code-switching. The child addressed in 22.28 always calls this grandmother yæy
(‘paternal grandmother’). This explains why the mother used this term within the noun phrase
containing a Tok Pisin code-switch.
   In summary: the major function of code-switching between Tok Pisin, English, and Man-
ambu is asserting one’s authority—that is, both Tok Pisin and English are used as ‘power-talk’;
nowadays, English is rapidly monopolizing this function. At the same time, Tok Pisin (but not
English) plays a special role in language socialization: it is considered ‘easier’ than Manambu
and is employed as a ‘baby talk’.
   Another function of Tok Pisin is filling a perceived gap in the language. Manambu
does not have a dedicated contrast marker, so tasol comes in as in 22.7 and T2.3. A similar
explanation would hold for the introduction of sapos ‘if’ in 22.8 (Manambu has a fairly
elaborate system of conditionals, but not a word for ‘if’), and for the disjunction o (as in T2.50).
There is no special word for ‘everything’—no wonder an exasperated mother exclaimed about
her baby daughter trying to grab everything: everﬁng kur@-k! (everything get-purp.ss) ‘She is
going to grab everything!’
   Similar examples abound for lexical items. Filling a lexical gap accounts for the use of
mas ‘must’, tabu ‘forbidden’, and the verb laik ‘like’. The concepts of ‘liking’ and ‘wanting’
can be expressed through using the desiderative modality, a speech report construction, a
complex predicate with the form m@yakw kwa-, or a body part construction with the noun
mawul ‘insides’. But each of these constructions is rather complex, and fraught with additional
overtones. Most speakers ﬁnd it easier to say wun laiki-na-wun ‘I like’ or wun ma: laik (I neg
like) ‘I don’t like’ rather than wun ma: wa-na-wun (I neg say-pres-1sgbas) ‘I am saying no’. Note
that the latter form is in fact ambiguous between ‘I don’t want’, ‘I don’t like’ and ‘I refuse’ (to
say ‘no’ to). Here, the introduction of Tok Pisin results in a resolution of potential ambiguity.
And this takes us to the next point.
616      22 Genetic and Areal Relationships   We saw in Chapter 21 that Manambu abounds in polysemous terms. Tok Pisin helps disam-
biguate polysemy. We can recall that wuk@- can mean ‘hear, listen, smell, obey, and worry’. By
using a Tok Pisin term wori ‘worry, miss someone’ to replace wuk@- a speaker avoids a potential
misunderstanding.
   The same word suku- is used for ‘write, carve, record’—to disambiguate these, one often
says raitim and rikodim, keeping suku- just for ‘carve’. The Manambu word ñ@g means ‘leaf,
mosquito net, paper, letter’—but the Tok Pisin word pas only means ‘letter’, and its use makes
communication more eﬃcient (see 22.6 and 22.37). We can recall, from §21.1.1, that k@- means
‘eat, drink, consume (e.g. smoke)’. Tok Pisin distinguishes kaikai ‘eat’ and dringim ‘drink’—
and some speakers, especially mothers, use these words when urging children to eat or to drink,
to ensure that the distinction is made. Along similar lines, laku means ‘know’ and ‘understand’.
And one frequently hears wun save ma: t@ (I know neg have:neg) ‘I don’t know, I have no
knowledge’ rather than wun laku-n ma: t@ (I know/understand-seq neg have:neg) ‘I don’t
know/understand, I have no knowledge/understanding’. The compound gab@-ma:j refers to
a traditional story (e.g. Texts 1 and 3) and to a teacher; many people choose unambiguous
stori and ticha, to avoid potential confusion.
   Traditional Manambu had the same word meaning ‘truth’ and ‘lie’ (sua:l); the two meanings
can be disambiguated with a special construction (see Chapter 21). But it is quicker and easier
to say giaman ‘lie’ (originally from English gammon) and tru ‘true’, or tru stori. And this takes
us to yet another function of Tok Pisin code-switches—that of a ‘shortcut’.
   The Manambu speakers themselves often lament that Tok Pisin is a ‘shortcut’—a language
where brukim means ‘break’, no matter what sort of breaking we are talking about, karim
‘carry’ covers all sorts of carrying, and kukim ‘burn’ does not allow one to distinguish diﬀerent
types of ‘burning’. (I heard similar complaints from Gala speakers who plainly stated that Tok
Pisin is not a language at all, only a ‘shortcut’.)
   However, the lure of a quick-and-easy shortcut is strong. It is easier to say stori ‘story’ than
to choose an exact term—gabu-ma:j ‘traditional story’, or wa-saki-ma:j ‘true story’ (21.37). A
short term hat ‘hat’ is easier than aba-wapi (head+lk-clothing) (see 21.38). A lengthy ap t@-
na-d-@ mi (bone/strength ‘stand’/have-act.foc-3masc.sgbas.vt-lk wood) ‘hard wood’ is liable
to be replaced with short strongpela (tp) mi (m), with the same meaning. Same for higher
numerals: we can recall, from §10.6.2, that numbers higher than ten in Manambu are complex
in structure. As a result, Tok Pisin and English numbers are preferred, as an ‘easy’ option (see
T2.65).
   Manambu has several ways of saying ‘I am lazy, fed up, unwilling (to do something)’. Body
part constructions s@ p (skin) jina, sakwina (lit. skin is tired) mean ‘I am tired and fed up’
and s@p væt yina (lit. skin goes heavy) means ‘I am very tired, unwell’ (see §21.4). A complex
predicate kwas@k yinawun means ‘I am unwilling (to do something)’ (cf. 13.81). Tok Pisin
has one word, les ‘tired, unwilling, dislike’, which covers all these distinctions. Young people
and children often use les in combination with the functionally unmarked auxiliary yi- ‘go,
say’: one hears les yinawun instead of any of the four combinations above. This construction
has the same syntax as kwas@k yi- (it requires a dative-aversive-marked nominalization, as
in 9.8 and 13.81). The following example comes from a spontaneous conversation: a thirty-
something speaker refused to drink any more water (for fear of having to go down to pee at
night):22.35 les yi-na-wun                      gu    k@ka:k               wus-a:k
      tired go-act.foc-1fem.sgbas.vt water eat/drink+red+dat urine-lk+dat
      ‘I don’t want to drink water (or ‘I am fed up with drinking water’) for fear of urine’
                                             22.4 Inﬂuence of Tok Pisin and of English        617   And using brukim for ‘break’ means that one does not have to be speciﬁc—we can recall
that Manambu has numerous verbs for breaking, but no generic term. This is similar to the
ways in which some speakers use the general verb m@gi- if explicitly asked to avoid excessive
code-switching, as we saw in §21.3.2.
   Speakers are aware of the fact that using Tok Pisin involves simpliﬁcation—and this attitude
is indeed reﬂected in how Tok Pisin appears to be used as ‘baby talk’. Along similar lines,
speakers of inﬂectionally complex languages—such as Bilingual Navajo—borrow ‘easy-to-
process’ words from English (Schaengold 2004: 52–7; Aikhenvald 2006b: 34). Using a Tok
Pisin word, or a whole phrase, results in levelling distinctions obligatorily made in Manambu.
   A further function of Tok Pisin inserts is getting the point across; this is similar to ‘reit-
eration’ as one of the functions of code-switching recognized by Gumperz (1982). A frequent
technique here involves parallelism, whereby native and borrowed forms appear together (see
Hajek 2006; Aikhenvald 2006b), as in 21.22, 21.57, 22.9, 22.25, T2.54, and 22.36–7. Such
parallelism may involve repetition of a whole clause, as in 21.22, 21.57, and 21.42, or a noun
phrase, as in 22.36, or a noun, as in 22.37, or just a modiﬁer, as in 22.18.22.36 planti man meri     samasama du ta:kw t@-na-di
      many man woman many+lk man woman have-act.foc-3plbas.vt
      ‘There are many people, many people’22.37 ñ@n-a:k             ñ@g pas suku-k@-tua
      you.fem-lk+dat letter letter write/carve-fut-1sgsubj.vt+3fem.sgbas.vt
      raiti-k@-tua
      write-fut-1sgsubj.vt+3fem.sgbas.vt
      ‘I will carve, write you leaf, letter’   Such parallelism has additional functions for diﬀerent speakers. Examples 22.36 and 22.37
were produced by relatively young men (around 40) who consider themselves knowledgeable
in the traditional lore. They typically code-switch with Tok Pisin, but are acutely aware of
this ‘deﬁciency’, and insert the Manambu forms whenever they can, as a sort of afterthought.
The parallelism in 22.33 had another additional function: stressing the point, and making the
speech more expressive. Note that the order of Tok Pisin and Manambu parallel forms in 22.37
diﬀers from that in 22.36 and 22.18. Example 13.22 also illustrates such a parallelism: the Tok
Pisin mas ‘must’ is accompanied by the third person command form of the verb ‘know’ (which
already has a deontic meaning of obligation: see §13.2.2). The function is to make sure the
addressee understands the importance of this obligation.
   In addition to this, code-switching may be used to stress a particular point (see Hill and Hill
1986: 377). Tok Pisin forms often sound more expressive than their Manambu equivalents.
If someone really approves of something, they are likely to exclaim Nambawan! rather than
Vyakat-a-m@y (good-lk-very) ‘very good’; or tru-al! (true-3fem.sgnom) ‘it is true!’ rather
than m@y-a sual-a ‘it is really a true story!’ During the Saki (name debate) ceremony, such
exclamations were accompanied with an often unanimous sound of appreciation (sounding
like a very loud AAAŰ-111Ů). And a negative Nogat! reﬂects a much stronger rejection than
a simple Manambu ma: or even ka (see 10.24). This diﬀerence in illocutionary force between
Tok Pisin and Manambu can be linked together with the role of Tok Pisin as a ‘power-talk’.
   We will see in §22.6 that Manambu is currently threatened by the encroachingly dominant
Tok Pisin and English. As a consequence, many speakers have word retrieval problems. And
this is where Tok Pisin insertions come into play—a Tok Pisin equivalent is the one they
618       22 Genetic and Areal Relationshipsremember ﬁrst. This is perhaps the saddest function of Tok Pisin, and the one speakers lament
most. For them, mixing Tok Pisin with Manambu results in a ‘rubbish talk’.
                22.5 new development s i n t he manambu lexiconDespite extensive code-switching, there is a marked tendency to extend the meanings of Man-
ambu words to refer to newly introduced items and activities. The maintenance of these items
is ensured by language purists (see §22.6) concerned with the survival of Manambu, and those
speakers who prefer to avoid ‘rubbish talk’—Manambu peppered with Tok Pisin inserts. In
public places outside the Manambu-speaking villages, many of these words serve the function
of ‘secret talk’—everyone would understand mani (Tok Pisin for ‘money’), but hardly anyone
would make any sense of kabak (lit. ‘stone’) or sa:n (lit. shell valuable). 4
   For instance, a riﬂe is called jarkañ (a term for bamboo shoot originally used as a storing
tube), and jarkañ l@-k@ væy (bamboo.tube 3fem.sg-poss+3fem.sg spear, lit.‘bamboo tube’s little
spear’) is the word for ‘bullet’. A term for a long piece of bamboo kañgu is used to refer to a
policeman (by reference to policemen carrying a long bamboo-like riﬂe on their shoulder).
   The word kabak ‘stone’ is used to refer to large sums of money, and sa:n ‘shell valuable’ is
used to refer to money (any quantity). The word j @l@g ‘ten shell valuables strung together’
is used for a ten-kina note. Kabas@k ‘seed’ now means ‘rice’, t@k-@-mi (seed/little.fruit-lk-
tree) ‘seed, little fruit of a tree’ is a term for ‘medicine’; wali-na:gw (white.man-sago) refers
to ‘biscuit’, and wali-gus (white.man-paddle) means ‘outboard motor’. Few people say kar for
‘car’—most prefer val ‘canoe’, and hardly anyone says umbrella—aba-ñ@g (head+lk-leaf) is
used instead. The term for a plane is mi val (high canoe); though many do switch to balus,
a Tok Pisin term. Telefon is in competition with mi ma:j (high talk). The term j @b ‘design,
drawing’ is also used for ‘letter, literacy’; its major competitor is English letter. And the
term taba-ñ@ (hand+lk-sun) is used in the meaning of ‘watch’ more than the English word
watch.
   Some new developments in the Manambu lexicon result in creating further patterns of
polysemy. An example of a newly evolving polysemy is kayik ‘image, picture, reﬂection (in
water), shadow, ghost’ (see §21.4), and nowadays also ‘photographs, pictures’ and ‘ﬁlms’.
(Examples 16.107 and 19.20 illustrate kayik in the sense of ‘photographs’.) A noun phrase
kayik v@-bana tami: (image see-1plsubj.vt+3fem.sgbas.vt area) can be understood as ‘area
where we see ﬁlms’, and ‘area where we see ghosts’. This is, of course, easy to disambiguate in
a context of real life. Another option, as we saw above, is to use a Tok Pisin or an English word
instead—neither ﬁlm nor piksa evoke any implications of ‘ghosts’.
   The noun ñ@g ‘leaf, mosquito net’, also used for ‘letter’ (but hardly ever for ‘book’), presents
a similar problem. We saw in 22.6 and 22.37 that it is in stiﬀ competition with Tok Pisin pas.
   As mentioned above, suku- means ‘carve, write, record (on a tape-recorder)’. This polysemy
posed unexpected problems for a ﬁeldworker as well as for the speakers, since it does not
allow one to easily distinguish between ‘writing’ and transcribing a story, and ‘recording it’.
The only way out appears to be a Tok Pisin code-switch (see §22.4.2 above). Another new
pattern of polysemy involves the verb v@- ‘see, look’ in the meaning of ‘read’ (see 21.13a, b). It
is diﬃcult to distinguish between ‘look at a book’ (as a child or an illiterate person would do),
and ‘read a book’—so Tok Pisin ridim ‘read’ comes to the rescue.","[636, 637, 638, 639, 640, 641, 642, 643, 644, 645]"

                          19.5.5 Syntactic role of speech reportsThe role of direct and of indirect speech report in multiclausal speech report constructions
depends on the transitivity of the reporting verb. A reporting verb may be intransitive, transi-
tive, or even ditransitive (see Munro 1982: 304–5, and discussion in Aikhenvald 2008).
   The verb wa- ‘say’ is the only verb in Manambu consistently used to introduce and frame
speech reports. This verb is rather unusual in its transitivity patterns. Unlike any other verb
(including the other two verbs of speech, bla- and yi-, discussed in §21.1.3) it appears in a
variety of frames.
                                                                   19.5 Speech reports       489A. wa- ‘say’ as a ditransitive verb can appear in two frames.
  First, the verb wa- can take two NP objects meaning ‘telling someone something’, or ‘telling
someone about something’. Its second argument is an addressee. The object (as in 19.1) or the
addressee (as in 19.59) can be cross-referenced in the second position if appropriate.
19.59 ñan-a             t@p-a-ma:j       wa-k@-tua-digur-@k
      we-lk+fem.sg village-lk-story say-fut-1sgsubj.vt-2plbas.vt-conf
      ‘I will tell you (many) our village tale’
   A similar example is in T2.67. We will see, in §19.8, that wa- in this usage can occur with
a headless relative clause in the O slot used as a complementation strategy. The object is
questioned with agwa ja:p ‘what?’ (see §10.4) used to question direct objects of any kind
(cf. example 10.84). The verb wa- can also mean ‘promise’, and is then used ditransitively.
The thing ‘promised’ is the object, which can also be questioned with agwa ja:p ‘what?’
19.60 [l@-k@-k      wa-tu-di               ja:p]
      she-obl-dat say-1sgsubj.p-3plbas.p thing
      k@dika-n-adika
      dem.prox.react.top+pl-pred-react.top+pl
      ‘Here are the things I promised her’
   Secondly, the verb wa- as ditransitive verb can occur with a name in what looks like an object
slot, and the object or person named as a second argument, as in T2.3 (‘those whom we call
Gala’) and in T2.18 (this (man) by that name of Kamkudi), 19.12, and 19.76. In 19.61, it is
used with a reciprocal awarwa in the meaning of ‘address each other as (name)’.
19.61 ñamus           ma:m          awarwa wa-na-b@r
      younger.sibling elder.sibling rec     say-act.foc-3plbas.vt
      ‘They two address each other as siblings’ (lit. say younger sibling elder sibling to each
      other)
  The object or person named can be cross-referenced on the verb, and questioned either with
agwa ja:p ‘what?’, or s@ ‘who?’ (see §10.4). In contrast, the name is never cross-referenced on
the verb. It is questioned with ata ‘how?’, just like NP objects in the examples discussed at B
below, and direct speech reports.
B. wa- ‘say’ as a transitive verb can take an NP object if the NP is something being said, e.g.
‘verse’ in 10.113, or a wrong word in 19.62a. A young girl instructed an older speaker not to
use a Tok Pisin word:
19.62a lukautim wa-tukwa
       lukautim say-proh.gen
       ‘Do not say lukautim!’
  It can also be used in describing ways of pronouncing a word, as in 19.62b:
19.62b [n@k@-di ta:kw sajagalavi wa-kwa-na-di]             [n@k@-di ta:kw sag@lawi
       other-pl woman sajagalawi say-hab-act.foc-3plbas.vt other-pl woman sag@lawi
       wa-kwa-na-di]             wun saw@ngalawi wa-kwa-na-un
       say-hab-act.foc-3plbas.vt I   saw@ngalawi say-hab-act.foc-3plbas.vt
       ‘Other women pronounce (lit. say) sajagalawi, other women say sag@lawi, I say
       saw@galawi’
490      19 Other Dependent ClausesThe word for language, kudi, as the object of wa- refers to a typical sound made
by a non-human, e.g. kudi aka wa-na (language dem.dist.react.top.fem.sg speak-
act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt) ‘she (the pot with water boiling) is making a sound’, or t@b kudi wa-na
(sky language speak-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt) ‘thunder is sounding’ (lit. sky speaks language).
Alternatively, the sound itself can be reproduced, as in 19.63:
19.63 tapwuk [p@kaka:u]          ada                            wa:d
      rooster cockadoodledoo dem.dist.react.top+masc.sg say+3masc.sgbas.p
      ‘The rooster said: “cock-a-doodle-doo” ’, or ‘The rooster sang’
In this use, the verb wa- allows for cross-referencing the addressee, or the time, or the manner
as appropriate, and also the object NP referring to what’s being said. What is being said can be
questioned with ata ‘how’. This is similar to direct speech reports—see C below.
  The verb wa- forms a number of idiomatic collocations with interjections and adverbs, e.g.
ay wa- (ay say-) ‘let know’, ya:k wa- or ya:kya wa- (OK say) ‘agree, accept; say OK’. The
combination vyak@ta wa- (good say) means ‘approve’, and ma: wa- means ‘refuse; reject’. These
are lexicalized: the meaning of the whole is not easily deducible from the meanings of the parts.
And the component in the speech report slot cannot be questioned.
  A reported command cast as purposive indirect speech report is a purposive clause, of
the type discussed in §19.4 above (see 19.54). It occupies the object slot of the verb wa- as
a transitive verb. If the content of a reported command has to be questioned, ata is used.
Alternatively, a constituent within a purposive clause can be questioned as appropriate (see
§10.4). The ﬁrst person imperative-permissive wa:u ‘may I talk?’ is used intransitively, as a
turn-taking device.
C. wa- ‘say’ with a direct speech report: transitive or ditransitive?
  A direct speech report cannot be considered a direct object of the verb wa- since it can never
be cross-referenced on this verb, and has to be questioned with the adverbial interrogative ata
‘how’ or its reduplicated version ata ata. The question at 19.64 can be answered with 19.61,
19.62a–b, or 19.53:
19.64 ata (ata) wa-na?
      how       say-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt
      ‘What did she say?’
  The same question word can be used to question the sound made by a rooster in 19.63.
  An adverbial demonstrative ‘thus’ is used to anaphorically refer to a speech report:
19.65 [mæy, mæy] k@tawa wa-na
      come, come like.this say-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt
      ‘ “Come, come”, this is what she said’ (lit. like this she said)
Addressee, time, manner can be cross-referenced on the verb of speech accompanied by a direct
speech report, as in T1.23, T2.7, and T1.26 (see §3.1, for the discussion of cross-referencing).
The speech report can never be cross-referenced.
   We can thus conclude that direct speech report is not a prototypical object. However, it
is obligatory, and therefore is to be considered a core argument of the verb ‘say’. It is best
considered a special grammatical relation.
   The transitivity patterns described in this section only apply to the underived verb wa-. When
accompanied by directionals, or when used as ﬁrst component in verb compounds, wa- can be
used either transitively or ditransitively, like any other verb which displays this transitivity
alternation (see §4.2.2 and Chapters 15 and 16).
                                                                   19.5 Speech reports       491                      19.5.6 Polysemous patterns in speech reportsIn many languages, especially in the New Guinea area, speech reports express a variety of
meanings beyond mere reporting of what someone else had actually said (see the survey in
Aikhenvald 2008). The following meanings are expressed by direct speech reports.
I. Internal speech and thought are cast as direct speech reports, as in T3.28 (‘think, hope’).
An alternative is to use the expression maw@la:m wa- (inside+lk+loc say) ‘think, say to
oneself’. The semantics of mawul is discussed in §21.4.
19.66 [k@                ta:kw kra-k@-tua]
      dem.prox+fem.sg woman marry/bring-fut-1sgsubj.vt+3fem.sgbas.vt
      [m@wulam        ada                    wa-na-d]
      inside+lk+loc dem.top+masc.sg say-act.foc-3masc.sgbas.vt
      ‘He said to himself (lit. in his mind/inside), “I will marry this woman” ’
II. Desires and intentions of non-first person are expressed as direct speech reports. A
speech report typically contains a same-subject purposive, as in 19.67, or a desiderative, as in
13.57–8 (also see 19.58a).
19.67 [kayik         kur@k]           [wa-na]
      picture/image do/get+purp.ss say-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt
      ‘She wants or intends to take pictures’
  If intention is expressed with a loan from Tok Pisin (pait ‘hit’), it appears uninﬂected, as in
19.68—a threat to a naughty baby to make her stop crying lest Tedison whom she was thought
to be afraid of might hit her.
19.68 Tedison [pait] [wa-k-na-d]
      Tedison hit    say-fut-act.foc-3masc.sgbas.vt
      ‘(Calm down), Tedison intends to hit you’
  An alternative is employing an inﬂected clause as a speech report, as in 19.69, or a noun in
the dative case as in 19.70.
19.69 pusi væn        t@-na-d                        [pap@r
      cat see+seq stand-act.foc-3masc.sg.bas.vt later

      eat-fut-1sgsubj.vt+3fem.sgbas.vt say-act.foc-3masc.sgbas.vt
      ‘The cat is and has been looking (at the duckling), he wants to eat her later (lit. he says
      “I will eat her later” ’
19.70 diya:k        wa-na
      shit+lk+dat say-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt
      ‘She wants to have a shit’ (said about a 1-year-old baby who could not talk yet, but
      whose intentions were clear)
None of these examples involves an actual speech act. As I was coming downstairs with a
loaded camera (without saying anything), 19.67 was said by a speaker to make sure the girls
whose pictures I was to take were ready. Tedison (mentioned in 19.68) had no idea that his
name had been used to cajole the little baby into behaving herself. The baby mentioned in
13.67 could not talk yet—so her desire to have a poo could not have been expressed verbally.
492     19 Other Dependent ClausesAnd cats do not talk—the cat’s intentions in 19.69 were clear from the way it looked at the
duckling.
III. Reason, cause, and purpose are expressed as direct speech reports. Example 19.71 did not
involve any speech acts. This was an answer to a child’s question about why her mother had
gone out:19.71 [wus-a:k     wa-ku]        [aka
      pee-lk+dat say-compl:ss dem.dist.react.top.fem.sg
      waku-na]
      go.out-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt
      ‘She has gone out because of (desire to) pee’ (lit. ‘saying “because of pee” she went out’)  And 16.81 explains the intentions of 9-month-old baby who could not yet talk.
  We saw, at §16.2.2, that speech reports are one of the biclausal causative strategies; examples
are at 16.84, 13.24–5, and T2.34.
IV. Apprehensives can be expressed as direct speech reports. In 19.72 a speech report with an
apprehensive meaning contains an irrealis form meaning ‘might’ (see §13.3):19.72 [aw yaga-di]             [a-di          du-aba:b aw [a-di             a:s
      then be.scared-3plbas.p dem.dist-pl man-too then dem.dist-pl dog
      vya-k@-dana-dian]             wa-ku]
      hit-irr-3plsubj.vt-1plbas.vt say-compl:ss
      ‘So they were afraid, men too, lest the dogs might hit them (lit. having said “Those dogs
      might hit us” )’V. The end result of counting is usually expressed as direct speech report, as in 19.73 and
T2.21. Neither of these contains an actual speech report: the child we were talking about in
19.73 did not speak Manambu and was too shy to speak in the presence of a white woman
anyway.19.73 nabi a:li wa:d
      year four say+3masc.sgbas.vt/p
      ‘He is 4’ (lit. ‘he says four’)We have seen that speech reports do not have to imply a speech act. However, there are two
major diﬀerences between speech reports which do not imply an actual speech act and those
reports that do.
   First, a direct speech report can precede or follow the reporting verb (as we saw in §19.5.1
above) only if the actual speaking took place. If a speech report is used to express any of
the meanings detailed in I–V in this section, it always has to precede the verb ‘say’. Reported
commands as indirect speech reports also have to precede the verb of speech.
   Secondly, speech reports which do not imply an actual speech act tend not to be introduced
by a speech introducer ata ‘then’ (see Aikhenvald 2008).
   An additional way of making clear that a speech act has actually taken place is by using a
‘framing’ construction illustrated in 19.51. Then, if a speech report follows the framing clause,
another framing clause is often added at the end of the speech report of the kind ‘they said
[Speech Report] having said’. A typical example is at 19.74:
                                                19.6 Clause linking involving connectives       49319.74 [wa:l ja-k-na-d]                             [wa-tu@-l]                    [wa-ku],
      rain rain-fut-act.foc-3masc.sgbas.vt say-1sgsubj.p-3fem.sgbas.p say-compl:ss
      [ata wa:d],                   [ma:] [j@ ma:] [wa-ku]
      then say+3masc.sgbas.p no           rain neg say-compl:ss
      ‘ “It will rain”, I said saying, then he said, “No, it won’t rain”, having said’
   A speech report which does not imply a speech act cannot be used in such a ‘framing’
construction. Neither can the verb wa- in any of its ditransitive or transitive usages without
a direct speech report; nor if it is used in one of the lexicalized collocations, such as ma: wa-
‘refuse, reject’ or ya:kya wa- ‘agree’.
   Framing constructions are very frequent. They also appear in speech reports in the local
Tok Pisin: one frequently hears a dialogue being reported using a quote frame na em i tok
olsem na em i tok (and he said thus and he said). This apparent redundancy serves a purpose:
it distinguishes speech acts as speech acts from their metaphorical extensions.
                  19.6 c lause linking involving connectivesConnectives involved in linking clauses occupy clause-initial position. Connectives do not
occur in any of the medial clauses discussed in Chapter 18, or dependent clauses in this chapter.
The connective a-l@-k ‘because; this is why’ is an exception: it can occur in a causal clause (as in
19.75). This connective derives from that-fem.sg-DAT ‘for that’ and is employed only if explicit
statement of reason is appropriate:
19.75 [l@ wuk@mar-la]                              [al@k        ma:
      she forget-3fem.sgsubj.p+3fem.sgbas.p this.is.why again
      wa-tua,                           a                    ma:j]
      say-1sgsubj.vt+3fem.sgbas.vt dem.dist+fem.sg story
      ‘She forgot (it), this is why I am telling it again, the story’
   A similar example is at 4.16. Alternatively, the connective al@k can be used within a causal
clause, as in 19.76. This is an explanation as to why there is no men’s road and women’s road
in Malu village.
19.76 [al@k m@ya numa-di k@p            r@-ma:r-da-l@k]         [ [du-a-ya:b
      so     real big-pl      ground sit-neg.sub-3pl-because man-lk-road
      takwa-ya:b           wa-n] kwasa             kwa-ku]       [b@       suan
      woman+lk-road say-seq small+fem.sg stay-compl.ss already hard
      yi-na]
      go-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt
      ‘So since they do not occupy really big territory, since what is called men’s and women’s
      road is small, it is diﬃcult (to have them)’
In T1.16 al@k occurs after the subject wun ‘I’, since the subject is fronted as part of a topical-
ization strategy (see §20.2). This connective can link sentences as well as clauses as in 18.25,
and T1.22. It often occurs in a main clause preceded by a medial causal clause, as in 18.49 and
19.77, or by another medial clause, as in 18.52.
19.77 [d@ da-d@-l@k],                   [(al@k)      wi     waku-dian]
      he go.down-3masc.sg-because this.is.why house go.out-1plbas.p
      ‘Since it (plane) went down, [this is why] we left our houses’
494      19 Other Dependent Clauses   We recall, from §18.7, that the connective al@k and the causal medial clause marker -l@k share
their etymology: both come from a dative-marked feminine form of the functionally unmarked
distal demonstrative a-.
   We saw in §18.3 that the medial clause form t@-ku (stand-compl.ss) operates almost like a
conjunction ‘thus, and so’ when it follows another medial clause (see 18.28). This form is indeed
in the process of grammaticalization as part of a conjunction: al@k t@-ku (dem.dist.fem.sg+dat
stand-compl.ss) is used as a clause linker meaning ‘and so, as a result’. It is pronounced as one
phonological word. This connective does not occur with causal clauses. An example is in 19.78:
19.78 [sana:k           karab@         ja:p kui-taka-dana-di]
      money+lk+dat men’s.house+lk thing give.to.third.p-put-3plsubj.vt-3plbas.vt
      [al@k       t@-ku        ma: t@]
      this.is.why be-compl.ss neg have.neg
      ‘They (the neighbouring group) gave away the things from men’s house for money, this
      is why they do not have (them anymore)’
  The connective aw ‘and then; so; but’ links clauses and sentences. Its meaning may involve
contrast, as in 19.79:
19.79 [vyak@ta-d],         [aw          wun ñan ma: t@],          [a-d@-r@b
      nice-3masc.sgnom contrast I             child neg have:neg dem.dist-masc.sg-fully
      lukauti-t@k]
      look.after-1duimpv
      ‘He (the foundling) is nice, and (surprise, surprise: unlike any normal woman) I don’t
      have a child, (so) let’s look right after this one’
   It occurs as a sentence linker in T2.5–6, and T2.8–9. Also see 19.72 for its sequential
meaning. When repeated, it refers to alternating actions, as in aw yi-n aw ya-n (and.then
go-seq and.then come-seq) ‘on the one hand coming, on the other hand going’ (T3.18). A
similar example, aw war-@n aw da-n (then go.up-seq then go.down-seq) ‘alternately going up
and coming down’ is in T2.8. This same form can link noun phrases, e.g. aw kami: aw lau-lap
(then ﬁsh then ripe-banana) ‘(we eat) sometimes ﬁsh sometimes banana’ (or both).
   The connective a ‘then, as a result’ has a sequential meaning, as in T2.3 and 19.4. It can link
dependent clauses, as in T3.18 where it is similar to aw. It may have an adversative meaning,
roughly translatable as ‘but’, as in 10.22b. The form a probably comes from the feminine distal
demonstrative ‘that’.
   Connectives which link sentences within a paragraph are ata ‘then’, and atawata:y (from ata
wa-ta:y ‘then say-cotemp’) ‘and so then, in summary, this is why’. The latter is a result of a
recent grammaticalization of ata and a medial clause form of ‘say’. The semantic development
is congruent with the use of wa- ‘say’ to express reason (see §19.5.6). The connective atawata:y is
often used without reference to an actual speech act, as in 18.33 where the speaker talks about
how the Avatip people lived during the Second World War when they had to hide from the
Japanese invaders. Or it may refer cataphorically or anaphorically to an actual speech report,
as in 19.80:
19.80 [atawata:y takwa-sua:l   taka-ya-da-d]                   [ta:kw

      wa-da-d]
      say-3plsubj.p-3masc.sgbas.p
      ‘Thus/this way they lied to him about women (lit. put woman-lie to him), “You will
      marry a woman, we will give you a young woman”, thus they said to him’   The connective ata often introduces speech reports which imply actual speech, as can be
seen throughout the texts at the end of this grammar. It typically precedes the verb and never
occurs on the ﬁrst sentence in a text (see examples 4.12 and T1.1, T1.8, T1.10, and T1.12). In
the third clause of T1.12 the connective ata is placed after the imperative verb ‘go’; this adds
to the urgency of the command.
   Ata can intervene between parts of numerous multiword constituents involving verbs (for
instance, complex predicates: see §17.1–5, and negative constructions: see Chapter 14).
   The question of whether the form ata meaning ‘how; thus’ and ata as a negator of desider-
ative and same-subject purposive (see §14.3.2) are related to each other and to the connective
ata remains open. Several instances of ata in its diﬀerent meanings do not occur; we can recall,
from §10.4, that a repeated form ata ata has just the interrogative meaning ‘how?’
   When used in the predicate slot or as part of predicate focus, ata ‘connective’ and ata ‘thus,
how’ take the predicate marker -n (see §10.2.3 on its occurrence with reactivated topic-marking
demonstratives), as in 4.79 and 10.103. No other connective can be focused or head a predicate.
   The connective k@pa:b ‘in case’ introduces dependent conditional clauses discussed at §13.7
and §18.8 (examples 13.88, and 18.52). This connective is most probably a terminative case form
of k@ p ‘just’ (§21.2.2). Just like any other connective, k@pa:b occupies a clause-initial position.                        19.7 j u xta p o s i t i o n o f m a i n c laus e sSeveral main clauses can be juxtaposed to one another. Such juxtaposed main clauses do
not have a special rising intonation contour characteristic of dependent juxtaposed clauses
discussed at §19.1. There is usually a short pause between the clauses. Juxtaposition of clauses
has the following semantic eﬀects.
I. A subsequent clause oﬀers a comment or a clariﬁcation to the preceding clause, elaborating
on it. Examples include 19.79, and also 19.9, 19.29, 14.11, 14.12, 14.53, 14.95, 14.97, 14.104, and
T1.9, T1.19–20, T1.22, and T1.28. A similar example is at 19.81: Kuk@lyabau was explaining
that she was a little girl when the Second World War broke out. The fourth clause provides
additional information to the third clause.19.81 [wun a                   taim numa         ñan ma: t@]         [war

      ‘I was not a big child that time, (time when) the war came. I was not a big child, I was a
      small child, then the war came’
496     19 Other Dependent Clauses   A subsequent clause often rephrases the preceding clause, as in 14.50. This serves as a
rhetorical device, to make sure the hearer understands the point made. Similar examples come
from beginnings and endings of stories—this can be seen in T1.35, T2.68, and T3.1.
II. A subsequent clause oﬀers an alternative, or a correction, to the preceding clause, as in
14.102 and 14.105. If the subsequent clause is cast in irrealis (see §13.3), it acquires an appre-
hensive meaning—that is, is understood as a warning against something negative. Examples
are at 13.43 and 19.82.
19.82 [a                plet akayblak]              [sa:r
      dem.dist.fem.sg plate impv+caus+overturn ﬂy
      r@-k@-k-la]
      sit-irr-irr+3fem.sgsubj.vt-3fem.sgbas.vt
      ‘Turn that plate upside down, or else a ﬂy would sit (on it)’
   A juxtaposed irrealis clause can be negated with the dependent negator -ma:r-, as shown
in 19.83 (the meaning is that of possible negative consequence). This is unlike irrealis in main
clauses which is negated with the particle ak@s (see §14.3.1); also see 13.35. This suggests that
juxtaposed irrealis clauses could well be treated as a subtype of dependent clauses.
19.83 [k@-di       plet ajan]           [a                  kamna:gw
      dem.prox-pl plate impv+wash dem.dist+fem.sg food
      k@-mar-k-na-ñ@n]
      eat-neg.sub-irr-act.foc-2fem.sgbas.vt
      ‘Wash these plates, (or else) you will not eat the food’
III. If one of the clauses is negated, the relationship between juxtaposed clauses is that of
contrast, as in 14.41, 14.135, and 14.156. Juxtaposition of a positive and a negative clause can
be used as a means of clausal disjunction, as in 7.23.
IV. The subsequent clause marks consequence or reason if it contains an imperative or a
desiderative, as in 13.12, 13.20, 13.23–4, 13.58, 14.31, 14.90, 14.108, and 19.48. Both clauses
can contain either an imperative or a desiderative, as in 19.84.
19.84 [væk akrawul]               [s@kul@k yi-k@r]
      pot impv+bring+inside cooking do-des
      ‘Bring the pot inside (the house), (because) I want to cook’
V. A clause juxtaposed to another clause has a simultaneous temporal meaning if the verb
cross-references time in the second position. This is the case in 19.81 (second clause: ‘(time
when) the war came’) and 9.33. This illustrates the anaphoric or cataphoric function of cross-
referencing time in the second position on the verb, which acts as an additional clause-linking
device.
VI. Juxtaposition of clauses may also reﬂect a sequence of actions, as in T1.27. Juxtaposition
of two clauses with positional verbs has a similar eﬀect, e.g. 19.85:
19.85 [wun-a-d@    warag     nagw@m         war-@n      kwa:d]
      I-lk-masc.sg ancestor sago+lk+loc go.up-seq stay+3masc.sgbas.p
      [ra:d]
      sit+3masc.sgbas.p
      ‘My ancestor kept going up the sago (ﬁelds) (and) settled down (lit. sat) (there)’
                                                        19.8 Complementation strategies         497We will see in §20.1.4 that there are no pivot restrictions on coreferential deletion of arguments
in clause juxtaposition, with just one exception: if juxtaposition of clauses reﬂects a sequence
of actions the subjects are always shared.
                         19.8 c o m p l e m e n tat i o n s t rat e g i e sManambu has no complement clauses as a separate clause type. Existing clause types are
used in lieu of complement clauses depending on verb type, the semantics of complement
clause (whether fact or activity, or potential), and the relative tense of the complement clause
(see Dixon 2006, for the basic principles for a typological approach to complementation). A
clausal complement can be in S or O function (but never in A function). These correlations are
summarized in Table 19.4.
   We discuss the existing complementation strategies one by one.
I. Completive medial clauses (discussed at §18.3) are used as clausal complements exclusively
in O function, with the verbs of perception such as ‘see/look’ and ‘hear/listen/obey’ (and
compounds and directional forms involving these: see Chapters 15 and 16). They indicate that
the action of the clausal complement precedes that of the main clause. The semantics of clausal
complement is activity or fact. If the subject of the main clause and of the clausal complement
are diﬀerent, diﬀerent subject forms are employed. Examples are at 19.86–7; also see T2.4,
T3.20, and T3.48.
19.86 [amæy wa-l@-k]                 [awuk]

      stand-compl.ss
      ‘After he’d seen that she’d done this because of the eel (her husband killed this eel)’
II. Juxtaposition of main clauses (also see §19.7) is used for a clausal complement in O func-
tion with the same verbs of perception. Juxtaposition is used if the action of the complement
is either simultaneous or subsequent to the main clause—in contrast to the completive medial
clauses in I above. Examples of simultaneous action are at 19.48, 19.88–9, 19.93a–b, 19.94, and
also T1.11 and T3.16.

      ‘Listen to/obey what I am saying’ (lit. having said, listen/obey)

      ‘That young woman looked up and saw: the up-there-man was sitting there’
  If the action of the clausal complement is subsequent to that of the main clause, it can be
cast in future tense, as in 19.90. Such constructions are polysemous, in that they can denote

this is morphological—we can recall, from §13.3, that future morphology is homophonous
with irrealis.19.90 [kamapu-k-na]                                 [v@-k@-tua]
      appear-fut/irr-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt see-fut/irr-1sgsubj.vt+3fem.sgbas.vt
      (a) ‘I will see her appear’ (lit, she will appear I will see)
      (b) ‘I will see if she appears’   The sentence in 19.90 could also be understood as consisting of a juxtaposed dependent
clause and a main clause (see §19.1), if it had a characteristic intonation contour with sharp
rise on the last word of the juxtaposed clause. Then the reading would have been ‘If she had
appeared I would have seen her/it’. This highlights the importance of intonation.
   A juxtaposed main clause can be used in lieu of a clausal complement of verbs ma: wa-
(no say) ‘refuse’ and ya:kya wa- (OK say) ‘agree’, when they refer to a fact or activity and
involve diﬀerent subjects. We will see, at IV below, that if their subjects are the same, the
same-subject purposive or dative-aversive-marked nominalization will be preferred. Poten-
tial meaning entails the use of either diﬀerent-subject purposive or a dative-aversive-marked
nominalization. In 19.91, a fact complement expressed with a juxtaposed clause (clause 1) is
contrasted to a potential complement expressed with a dative-aversive-marked nominalization.19.91 [yi-tua]                        [ma: wa-na-di]            [k@-di       t@p-a

      say-act.foc-3plbas.vt
      ‘They objected to the fact that I went (hunting), these village men refused me (the
      permission) to cut sago in the sago ﬁeld’   Juxtaposition is also used if the clausal complement is in S function of the verb kus@- ‘ﬁnish’.
The clause which corresponds to the complement often cross-references time or manner in
second position. The main clause takes feminine singular cross-referencing as a default option
(see §5.2.3).19.92 [warya-n         t@-ya-da-l]                           [aka

      already ﬁnish-3fem.sgbas.p
      ‘Their ﬁghting was already over’ (lit. they kept ﬁghting (it) was already over)  Juxtaposition of a main clause can also be used in lieu of a clausal argument in the O slot of
mental processes: knowing, as in 19.93a–b, and forgetting, as in 19.94. The juxtaposed clause
as a complementation strategy can be preposed or postposed to the clause containing the verb
of mental process:19.93a [bar@k         wa-m@n@-l]                            [wun ma: la:kw]

      ‘Then I forgot that I put (the hair cream on top of the mosquito net)’ (lit. I forgot it-was-
      the case that I put (it there) )
 Finally, one main clause juxtaposed to another may be used in lieu of a clausal argument
marking an activity in the S function in a verbless clause, as in 19.95.

      good-3fem.sgnom come.toward-2masc.sgsubj.vt+3fem.sgbas.vt
      ‘It is good you came/are coming’ (lit. it is good—you came/are coming)
In each case, the clause boundary is signalled by an intonation break (less than a second
duration).
III. A relative clause with or without an overtly stated head noun can be used to express
clausal complement referring to a fact, as in 19.96a–b. The way of saying ‘tell me why you
came’ is ‘tell me the reason for which you came’.
19.96a [ya-m@na                                  maw]
       come-2masc.sgsubj.vt+3fem.sgbas.vt reason/base

       say-2masc.sgsubj.vt+3fem.sgbas.vt listen+1sgimpv
       ‘You tell why you came, so that I listen’
  Another way of saying essentially the same thing is 19.96b. The diﬀerence is that in 19.96a
the speaker is requesting the full story concerning the reason of the other person’s coming,
while 19.96b presupposes a simpler statement—a ‘thing’ fought about:
19.96b [warya-bra                             ja:p] [ma: la:kw]
       ﬁght+come-3dusubj.p+3fem.sgbas.p thing neg know:neg
       ‘I do not know why (lit. thing) they fought about’
  Headless relative clauses, like the one at 19.25 (and 19.23a), can also be interpreted as
complementation strategies. They can express fact or activity. The syntactic context in 19.25
makes it clear that we are dealing with a headless relative clause: the common argument has
been omitted, but the adjective referring to it remains in its position in the noun phrase.
However, we saw above that a headless relative clause can be almost indistinguishable from
a main clause (cf. 19.26). And clause juxtaposition as a complementation strategy may also
be homonymous with a headless relative clause. So, 19.97a is inherently ambiguous between
reading (a), with a juxtaposed clause as a complementation strategy, and reading (b) as a
headless relative clause.

       (a) ‘Do you see that she is sitting here further away?’
       (b) ‘Do you see the one (female) sitting here further away?’
                                                        19.8 Complementation strategies          501   The ambiguity disappears if the second clause is negated: a relative clause would take the
dependent clause negator -ma:r-, and the juxtaposed clause would be negated like any main
clause (§14.5). The negated relative clause is at 19.97b, and a juxtaposed main clause at 19.97c:
19.97b [k@layir                     r@-ma:r-na]

       (a) ‘Do you see the one (female) not sitting here further away?’

       (a) ‘Do you see that (she) is not sitting here further away?’
A similar example, with a verb of knowledge and understanding, is at 19.98, an angry shout at
a naughty and disobedient child:
19.98 [laku-ñ@na]                                       [wa-tua]
      know/understand-2fem.sgsubj.vt+3fem.sgbas.vt say-1fem.sgsubj.vt+3fem.sgbas.vt
      (a) ‘Did you understand that I was telling you (what to do)?’
      (b) ‘Did you understand what I was telling you?’
IV. Same-subject purposive marks a purpose complement of any verb if semantically appro-
priate, as shown in 7.76 and 19.43 (see §19.4.1). Same-subject purposive can also be used as a
complementation strategy with the verb ‘say’ if the subject of the verb expressing purpose or
intention is coreferential with the subject of ‘say’—see 13.45, 19.57 (§19.5.4), and 19.99:
19.99 [kwasa        ñan t@-tu@-k]             [wun-a:k krak
      small+fem.sg child stay-1sg-compl.ds I-lk+dat take+purp.ss
      wa-m@n@-l]
      say-2masc.sgsubj.p-3fem.sgbas.p
      ‘When I was a small girl you spoke of marrying me’
V. Different-subject purposive clauses can mark a purpose complement of any verb (see
§19.4.1 and §13.4.2, and 13.54–5). This is also used in indirect commands, as in 19.54 and
13.49. A purposive clause as a complement of the verb wa- ‘say’ is the only way of forming a
diﬀerent-subject complement clause for the concept of ‘wanting’: 19.100 is ambiguous between
‘we told them to go to the house’ and ‘we wanted them to go to the house’. This ambiguity can
only be resolved by context.
19.100 [wiya:r          yi-b@r-k@k@k]    [wa-bana-b@r]
       house+lk+all go-3du-purp.ds say-1plsubj.vt-3dubas.vt
       (a) ‘We told them two to go to the house’
       (b) ‘We wanted them two to go to the house’
  In 13.51, only the ‘wanting’ reading is appropriate, since there was no speech act involved.
  In diﬀerent subject ‘wanting’ constructions, the verb ‘say’ can be omitted, as in 19.101. Then,
there is no ambiguity between ‘telling someone to do something’ and ‘wanting someone to do
something’. Similar examples are at 13.55, and 14.70.
19.101 wun-aba:b k@-d@                      ñan k@ta-b@         t@-d@-k@k@k
       I-too          dem.prox-masc.sg child now-already stand/be-3masc.sg-purp.ds
       ‘I too want this child to be like this now’ (lit. I too so that this child be like this now)
       ∗
         I too tell this child to be like this’
502     19 Other Dependent Clauses  The subject of the matrix clause can also be omitted—and then a sentence k@-d@ ñan k@ta-
b@ t@-d@-k@k@k means ‘(speaker wants) this child to be like this now’. This use of the diﬀerent-
subject purposive may be interpreted as an instance of desubordination—whereby the erstwhile
dependent clause becomes a main clause. Diﬀerent-subject purposive clauses are also used as
complementation strategies with verbs of asking, as in 13.52. An alternative is a direct speech
report, or a reported question, in VI below.
VI. Desiderative clause can mark a purposive complement of any verb—see §19.4.2 and §13.5
and 19.47. Desideratives in dependent clauses in O function can be used as complementation
strategies with potential meaning involving verbs of negative desire, such as ‘be unwilling’ in
19.102:
19.102 [wun tapwuk ba:d k@-k@r] [kwas@k yi-na-d@wun-@k]
       I     chicken egg eat-des unwilling go-act.foc-1masc.sgbas.vt-conf
       ‘I am unwilling to eat chicken egg’
   A desiderative clause in the direct speech report slot of the verb wa- is the only way of
reporting non-ﬁrst person’s desire—see 19.58 and 13.57. A desiderative clause can be in the
S slot of a verbless clause—see 13.65.
VII. Direct speech reports framed by the verb wa- ‘say’ can be used as complementation
strategies. We saw in §19.5 above that a direct speech report is a special grammatical relation.
The meanings of direct speech reports range from fact/activity to potential, and can involve
statements, questions, and commands.
VIII. Reported questions can be used as complementation strategies in the O slot of the verb
of knowledge/understanding:
19.103 [wun-aba:b ma: la:kw]        [agwa-mi d@-k@-di t@k@-mi-a-di]
       I-too         neg know:neg what-tree he-obl-pl seed-tree-lk-3plnom
       ‘I, too, do not know what tree they are seeds of’
19.104 [wun ma: la:kw]     [kas        du-ta:kw      t@-na-di]
       I      neg know:neg how.many man-woman be/have-act.foc-3plbas.vt
       ‘I do not know how many people they have (in Malu)’
In 19.104, the interrogative quantiﬁer kas is postposed to the noun ‘people’ which is its normal
position (see 10.109–10 in §10.4). Reported questions typically refer to fact or activity. They
are rather rare in discourse of any sort, and may have been calqued from Tok Pisin or even
English.
IX. Nominalizations are widely used as complementation strategies. We can recall, from
§9.1.1, that deverbal nominalizations with Ø-case marking in O function are employed as
complementation strategies, with the verb ‘know’, as in 9.2, and ‘ﬁnish’, as in 4.8. A deverbal
nominalization in S function can also serve as a complementation strategy, as in 9.3. A
nominalization can be a complement of a verb ‘be diﬃcult’, as in 4.7, 9.9, 19.43, and T3.20,
T3.33, and T3.35. An action nominalization can occur in the predicate slot, as in T3.34 (where
it is negated). These nominalizations always refer to activity or fact.
    Deverbal nominalizations marked with dative-aversive case -Vk are used in the O slot of
verbs to do with not wanting, refusing, forbidding, feeling shame, as in 9.5–6, 13.78, and 13.81,
waiting as in 9.4, forgetting as in 13.79, being afraid of doing something, as in 13.82, and in the
sense of ‘for fear of’, as in 9.7 and 13.83, or ordering not to do something, as in 15.111.
                                                     19.8 Complementation strategies        503   There are no restrictions on subject coreferentiality—in 19.105a the subjects of the matrix
clause and of the complementation strategy are the same, and in 19.105b they are diﬀerent:19.105a [bar@k         kwa-kwa-k] [ma: wa-na-wun]
        sick+lk+dat stay-red-dat neg say-act.foc-1fem.sgbas.vt
        ‘I don’t want to become sick’ (lit. to becoming sick I say no)19.105b [ñ@n      bar@k         kwa-kwa-k] [ma: wa-na-wun]
        you.fem sick+lk+dat stay-red-dat neg say-act.foc-1fem.sgbas.vt
        ‘I don’t want you to become sick’ (lit. to you becoming sick I say no)  In all these cases a dative-aversive nominalization used as a clausal complement has a
‘potential’ meaning, that of future projection, similarly to 9.8. This is in contrast to a zero-
marked nominalization—see 4.7 and 9.9. A dative-aversive nominalization can never occupy
the S slot of any verb, except for verbs of diﬃculty.
X. Sequencing medial clauses can mark clausal complements of a transitive verb (as in 18.12
and 19.106–7) or of a ditransitive verb (18.13), as complementation strategies. The meaning is
that of an accomplished fact rather than a prolonged activity. They have been attested with the
verb wa- ‘speak’ (18.12 and 19.106), ‘teaching’ as in 18.13, and perception, as in 19.107.19.106 [na:gw ka:n          rap@-n]       [wa-k@k@-tua]

       are”, he hit them two’They can also be used with a verb denoting ‘diﬃculty’, in the S function (see 20.65).
XI. Medial clauses marked with -k@b ‘as soon as’ can be occasionally used as clausal
complements in the O slot of verbs of perception, if the speaker wishes to emphasize the
temporal overlap between the perception and the activity (see §18.6).19.108 [atawa sa:d t@-d@-k@k@b]                  [ak@s
       thus way stand-3masc.sg-as.soon.as neg.hab
       v@-kwa-bana-d]
       see-hab-1plsubj.vt-3masc.sgbas.vt
       ‘We usually do not see it (the rainbow) standing like this’   The meaning of the clausal complement is always that of activity simultaneous with percep-
tion; however, such examples are rare.
Table 19.4 shows that, of all the complementation strategies, the juxtaposition strategy and
deverbal nominalization are the most versatile in terms of verb types they occur with. The
verbs of perception and knowledge allow the greatest number of options in terms of types of
complementation strategies they occur with.
504     19 Other Dependent Clauses                 19.9 de s u b o r d i nat i o n o f d e p e n d e n t c laus e sWhat is an essentially dependent clause can come to be used as a main clause through regular
ellipsis of the erstwhile main clause. This phenomenon known as ‘desubordination’ has been
described for numerous languages, including English (see Stirling 1998). Desubordination and
the change of status of clauses can result in the creation of new tense-aspect-mood paradigms
(as in Australian languages: Dixon 2002a: 148–9), or evidentiality (as in Estonian: Aikhenvald
2004a: 281–3).
   Just three of the medial dependent clause types in Manambu are used on their own (see
§18.2–4). In each case, this can be considered ellipsis; however, each use has its own semantic
overtones and can be analysed as a new clause type ‘in the making’.
   Sequencing medial clauses with the verb marked with -n (§18.2) appear as strong commands,
as shown in 16.96, and 19.109—an annoyed order to a naughty child to be seated:19.109 jupwi     taka-n
       backside put.down-seq
       ‘Put your backside down!’ (lit. putting your backside down!)  A medial completive same-subject form on its own can also be used as a command, an
even stronger one. The illocutionary force is comparable to German participle commands, e.g.
hingesessen! ‘sitting here!’ An example is at 19.110—the mother was even more annoyed than
when she shouted 19.109:19.110 t@k@r-@-m     da-ku
       chair-lk-loc sit-compl:ss
       ‘Sit down on the chair immediately!’ (lit. Having sat on the chair!)  These command strategies ﬁll what can be conceived of as a ‘gap’ in the system. We saw
in §14.4.1 that Manambu has three prohibitive forms: a general prohibitive and two strong
prohibitives. But there is only one positive imperative (§13.2). The diﬀerent degrees of strength
of command corresponding to the degree of strength of prohibition are expressed through
command strategies employing desubordinated clauses. Rough correspondences, with numbers
of example sentences, are in Table 19.5.
  A medial sequencing clause can be used as a complete sentence if it states the result of an
activity, as in 19.111. A pause of less than a second’s duration signals a sentence boundary.
There is no pause between the two sequential verb forms in the second sentence.","[515, 516, 517, 518, 519, 520, 521, 522, 523, 524, 525, 526, 527, 528, 529, 530, 531]"
"                                5.2.3 Markedness relationsThere are two main types of markedness—formal and functional. A term in a system is
formally unmarked if it has zero realization or a zero allomorph. If all of the terms in a
system except one are used only in speciﬁed circumstances and the remaining term is used
in all other circumstances, then this term is said to be functionally unmarked (cf. Dixon 1994:
56–7; Aikhenvald and Dixon 1998).
   We have seen (Table 5.2) that feminine gender is formally unmarked in a number of contexts:
feminine has two agreement forms, ø and -l, while masculine gender is always marked, and the
agreement form is always -d.
   The following evidence indicates that feminine is also functionally unmarked, independently
of the context and of agreement form—that is, whether it is ø or -l.
A. The feminine form is used for a referent whose gender, or size and shape, are unknown.
If they are known, then semantic principles outlined in §5.2.1 apply. The generic noun ma:gw
‘whatever; don’t remember what’ often triggers feminine gender (unless the speaker has a long
or big object in mind). An abstract noun triggers feminine agreement if the action is not
particularly intense or does not refer to an exceptional realization of a state. For instance,
ka:m ‘hunger’ is feminine when referring to a normal state of hunger. It is only when hunger is
exceptionally strong that it triggers masculine agreement.
   To ask ‘what is it?’, a feminine agreement form is used—unless one knows what to expect:
5.21 agwa ja:p-a?
     what thing-3fem.sgnom
     ‘What is it?’
  If something serious is suspected, then the masculine agreement form can be used in such
a question: 5.22 was asked as a reaction to a very loud commotion in the backyard. Gemaj
suspected that something serious must have happened (it turned out to be a snake).
                                                        5.2 Semantics and markedness         1255.22 agwa ja:p-ad?
     what thing-3masc.sgnom
     ‘What is it (this loud noise)?’
  The non-agreeing adjective ‘old’ which distinguishes two gender forms in the singular does
not have a plural form. Then the feminine form apaw is used as a general form, as in 5.23.
5.23 numa       apaw-adi           ñ@g
     big+fem.sg old:fem-3plnom mosquito.net
     ‘Mosquito nets are truly/largely old’
A group of referents of diﬀerent sex (for animates), shape, and size (for inanimates) requires
agreement with non-singular numbers, where gender is neutralized. Coordinate compounds
whose referent is inherently non-singular require non-singular agreement on modiﬁers. Just
occasionally, they can trigger singular agreement. Then, if the last noun has inherent gender, it
determines the agreement. In 5.24, the masculine agreement on the possessor is determined by
the inherent gender of asa:y ‘father’.
5.24 ñ@n-a-d@             amæy asa:y v@vak
     2fem.sg-lk-masc.sg mother father see+red+dat
     ‘(You) want to see your parents (lit. mother-father)’B. The feminine agreement form is used with a number of non-prototypical controllers, includ-
ing action and object nominalizations in the predicate slot: see 4.7–8. A purposive form as a
complementation strategy (in the function of the subject of a verbless clause: 5.25) and a copula
complement (5.26) requires feminine agreement.
5.25 t@p-a:r           yiya:k          numa ja:p-a
     village-lk+all go+red+dat big+fem.sg thing-3fem.sgnom
     ‘To go to the village is a big thing’
5.26 t@p-a:r           yiya:k       suan yi-na
     village-lk+all go+red+dat diﬃcult go-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt
     ‘To go to the village is hard’
   And we saw, in 4.65–6, that in modal constructions with n@b@ ‘be able’ (§4.5.1) the verb is
in the third person feminine form, no matter what gender and number the S or A is. A similar
example is 5.27.
5.27 n@b@ ya:n        suku-l
     able come+seq write-3fem.sgbas.p
     ‘One can carry on writing’ (referring to the two of us writing together)
  The feminine agreement form is used with loans with abstract meaning, e.g. numa apaw
tenkyu (big+fem.sg old+fem.sg thankyou) ‘thank you very much, a very big thankyou’ (lit. big
old thankyou).
C. The feminine form is the one consistently used in highlighting focus constructions—as
shown in 5.28 (see further discussion in §20.3):
5.28 Swakap-a:r           yi-ba-l-a
     Swakap-lk+all go-1plsubj.p-3fem.sgbas.p-3fem.sgnom
     ‘It is (the case) that we went to Swakap’
126      5 Gender Marking, Semantics, and Agreement Generic statements—often used for phatic communication—always require feminine agree-
ment, as in 5.29 which is almost like a ﬁxed expression.
5.29 aka-n                                aka
     dem.dist.react.top+fem.sg-pred dem.dist.react.top+fem.sg
     ‘Here it is, this is how things are’
Example 5.30 illustrates a summarizing phrase which can be roughly translated as ‘this is how
things are, this is it’. The distal demonstrative a is in a highlighting focus construction (this
pronoun is typically used for textual deixis: §10.2).
5.30 al-al
     dem.dist.fem.sg+3fem.sgnom-3fem.sgnom
     ‘This is how it is’ (lit. it is that, that is that)
   The same principle applies to adjective forms. The feminine agreement form of the adjective
‘old’, apaw, is used in generic statements: 5.31 is a general comment about old people who had
lived all their adult lives outside the village:
5.31 apaw    apaw    t@-ku                t@p-a:r          yiya:k  vyak@t ma:
     old.fem old.fem become-compl.ss village-lk+all go+red+dat good neg
     ‘Having become very old, it is not good to go to the village’D. The feminine, rather than the masculine, form of agreeing adjectives and agreeing closed
classes is used as a default form in a number of grammatical contexts where the gender
agreement is not required.
   The feminine form of agreeing adjectives is used when agreeing size adjectives appear in
adverbial functions, e.g. kwasa (small+fem.sg) ‘a little; almost’, numa (big+fem.sg) ‘in a big
way’ (also see 4.52 and discussion there), and in idiomatic expressions such as numa kwasa
kwa- (big small stay-) ‘spread the news’.
   The feminine form of the indefinite n@k@- ‘other, another’ appears in the distributive
headless adverbial n@k@m n@k@m (another.fem.sg+acc/loc another.fem.sg+acc/loc) ‘bit of
everything; in a random way’.
   The feminine form of the interrogative ak@- ‘which, where’ is used in the formation of a
general locational interrogative ak@m (which.fem.sg+loc) ‘where’. This form is also used to
enquire about the location of a singular object belonging to the feminine gender, and in a
complex construction to express the meaning ak@m t@-ku (which.fem.sg+loc stay-compl.ss)
‘where from’ (see §10.4). (See §6.2.4 on plural agreement with s@ ‘who’ to enquire about
someone whose sex is unknown.)
   The feminine form of gender-sensitive demonstratives is used in adverbial demonstra-
tives, such as kl@m (dem.prox+fem.sg+loc) ‘here’, al@m (dem.dist+fem.sg+loc) ‘there’. The
feminine form of the proximate demonstrative k@ is used in negative interjections kal or ka
(dem.prox+fem.sg+3fem.sgnom) ‘no! not that!’ (pronounced with falling intonation and high
intensity of the vowel).
   The feminine form of the cardinal numeral nakam@y ‘one, only one’ (§10.6.1) is used
in counting, e.g. nakam@y, viti, mugul, a:li ‘one, two, three, four’. It often replaces the mas-
culine form naka-d@-m@y in noun phrases (even when counting men). The adverb nakamib
(one.fem.sg+adv) ‘together’ is based on the feminine form nakam@y.
E. The ﬁnal piece of evidence in favour of the unmarked character of the feminine gender
comes from child language acquisition. Kerryanne, when she was 3, would use the feminine
                                                            5.3 Overt gender marking       127gender to refer to any unknown object or person, independently of their apparent sex or
size attributes. When looking at the photos of a white man and a boy (both obviously
male), she would invariably ask: Ka-l? (dem.prox+fem.sg-3fem.sgnom) ‘This feminine one is
(what)?’
Statistically, feminine agreement forms are more frequent than masculine, due to the fact
that nouns of quite a few semantic groups, e.g. time and manner, are typically feminine. The
feminine gender in Manambu shows an almost perfect match between a functionally and a
formally unmarked category. In the few instances where both gender forms are equally marked
and there is no formally unmarked choice (as in the case of the adjective ‘old’), the feminine
form is still unmarked functionally. The agreeing adjective yara- ‘ﬁne’ is an exception. It has
two gender forms, each of which is formally marked. The formally unmarked form yara is used
adverbially as well as in the copula complement function, rather than the formally marked
feminine singular yara-l. This conforms to the general tendency in the language to match the
two kinds of markedness.
   Most Ndu languages have the markers d ‘masculine’ and l ‘feminine’, also found in personal
pronouns in all languages except Gala. Gala and Manambu share ø as a feminine marker,
e.g. Gala ki ‘she’, kir ‘he’ (related to Proto-Ndu k@ ‘proximal demonstrative’, attested in
Manambu in this function). I hypothesize that the ø-marking in feminine forms is a Manambu-
Gala innovation, and that the forms containing -l are more archaic than the zero-marked
ones.                            5.3 overt gender markingNatural gender can be marked on a noun with a human referent, to disambiguate hybrid nouns
(i.e. nouns which can denote either male or female). Lexemes ta:kw ‘woman’ and du ‘man’ are
used to disambiguate the hybrid noun ñan ‘child’, e.g. takwa-ñan (woman+lk-child) ‘girl’, du-
a-ñan (man-lk-child) ‘boy’.
   The root du ‘man’ also occurs in one kinship term, du-a-ma:gw (man-lk-generic.noun)
‘brother’. Its female counterpart is jukwar ‘sister’ (which is non-segmentable, and does not
have any overt gender marker). The same construction can also be used with animate nouns
assigned a ﬁxed gender because of their shape (see B under §5.2.1), e.g. gwa:s ‘turtle’, du-a
gwa:s ‘male turtle’, takwa gwa:s ‘female turtle’. Gender reference of a few hybrid kin terms
can be disambiguated via a compound with the second element -du ‘man’ or -ta:kw ‘woman’,
e.g. yanan ‘grandchild’, yanan-ta:kw ‘granddaughter’, yanan-du ‘grandson’; babay ‘maternal
grandparent’, babay-du ‘maternal grandfather’, babay-ta:kw ‘maternal grandmother’.
   A semantically redundant gender marking component -ta:kw ‘woman’ appears with some
kinship nouns with feminine reference: e.g. ña:p and ñap-a-ta:kw ‘mother’s sister’ are used
interchangeably. Along similar lines, ti:d is ‘co-wife; woman of the same clan and generation
as ego’. The term tid@-ta:kw has the same meaning but appears to be used in not quite so usual
contexts: a rare and archaic form tid@-takwa:gw (co.wife-woman+pl) was used to refer to stars
as my potential ‘co-wives’, since stars belong to the same clan group as the one I was adopted
into (also see F in §5.2.1).
   Heads of noun phrases containing the noun asa:y as an augmentative marker are always
masculine, e.g. numa-d@ asa:y wuk (big-masc.sg father tooth) ‘huge big tooth’, or asa:y wuk
(father tooth) ‘huge tooth’, and 5.14. That is, asa:y in such noun phrases can be considered
tantamount to an overt gender and augmentative marker.
128     5 Gender Marking, Semantics, and Agreement  Vocatives distinguish masculine and feminine forms whose choice depends on the gender of
the addressee, e.g. yaban ‘Maliau clan: greeting, masculine addressee’; yab@nay ‘Maliau clan:
greeting, feminine addressee’. The latter form is also used as a denomination of a clan group
of the Iatmul with which the Maliau have long-standing ties.
  Personal names often contain formatives which identify them as feminine or masculine.
Male names often contain -du ‘man’ as their last component, as in Yuakalu-du, D@miyawi-
du, Duamakwai-du, Kawi-du. Female names contain -ta:kw ‘woman’, as in Ñamamayra-ta:kw,
Saun-ta:kw, Yuwas@pa-ta:kw, Ganvala-ta:kw. Frequently, names come in pairs, e.g. Kapavala-
du (male), Kapavala-ta:kw (female). (In actual interaction names are shortened, and the ﬁnal
syllable dropped; as a result, a shortened name Kapaval can refer to a man or to a woman.)
  Other formatives which occur in male names include  -bædi, as in Saun-bædi, Wali-bædi;
  -d@mi, as in Kwalgu-d@mi, Kasa-d@mi;
  -duí, as in Kipam-duí, Sagi-duí, Wali-duí;
  -gab, as in Kwal@k@-gab, S@ p@r-gab, Kab@-gab;
  -k@ban, as in Maji-k@ban, Madaw-k@ban, T@pwi-k@ban;
  -nakwan, as in Y@ma-nakwan;
  -m@li, -mæli, as in Saun@g@-mæli, Win-m@li, Yapun-m@li, Tuj@-m@li;
  -n@buk, as in Way-n@b@k, Yua-n@b@k, Kwaru-n@buk.","[151, 152, 153, 154, 155]"

                         20.1.3 Clause types and their propertiesThe major clause types in Manambu are (A) declarative, (B) imperative, and (C) interrogative.
Exclamatory clauses have the same structure as declarative clauses; they diﬀer from them
in their sharply falling intonation (§2.7). The imperative is only used in imperative main, or
independent, clauses. Other clauses can be either dependent or independent.
A. Declarative clauses. The major distinguishing features of independent, or main, clauses
and dependent clauses of various types were summarized in Table 19.1. The most prominent
features include:
  r Constituent order is not necessarily ﬁxed in main clauses (see §20.2) but is almost always
      ﬁxed in dependent clauses;
  r Any word class can head a predicate of main clause, while only verbs can head the predi-
    cate of a dependent clause; non-verbs have to occur as copula complements in dependent
    clauses;
  r The use of uninﬂected modal and aspectual forms is allowed only in main clauses; these
    same forms require support verbs when used in dependent clauses;
  r Main clauses distinguish future negation, past negation, habitual negation (and also see
    Chapter 14), while all the dependent clauses are negated with -ma:r- ‘dependent clause
    negator’.
That uninﬂected modal and aspectual forms require support verbs when used in dependent
clauses indicates that they are less ‘verbal’ and more noun-like than inﬂected verbs. This is a
property they share with non-verbs as predicate heads: in order to be used in dependent clauses,
non-verbs have to occur as copula complements of the verb t@- which is also used as the most
frequent support verb (see §17.2)—an example is at 20.26.
                                                                 20.1 Major constituents        519  The ﬁrst clause is an independent clause with a non-agreeing adjective in the predicate slot.
This is an example of a non-verbal clause. The second clause is a medial dependent clause
which contains a copula t@- and the same adjective in the copula complement slot. There is
no other way in which an adjective can appear in the predicate slot in a dependent clause (a
similar example is at T3.23). The third clause is a main clause, of the verbless type.20.26 [vyakat-ad]          [vyakat t@-ku]            [ya:kya]
      good-3masc.sgnom good         stand-compl.ss OK
      ‘It (masculine) was/is good. As it was good, (this was) OK’   As expected, main declarative clauses distinguish more grammatical categories than depen-
dent clauses. However, as we will see shortly, not all main clauses distinguish all categories.
   Main declarative clauses divide into three types: verbal, non-verbal, and verbless. Verbal
clauses can be headed by a fully inﬂected, a partially inﬂected, or an uninﬂected verb (see
§11.1.1). The number of inﬂectional positions depends on the category—for instance, positive
indicative verbs are always fully inﬂected, while imperatives (see B below) are partially inﬂected,
and negative indicative verbs are uninﬂected (unless they are in the habitual aspect)—see
Table 11.1. Verbal clauses express the full set of tense, aspect, mood, and modality distinc-
tions (detailed in Chapters 13–14), and can be headed by intransitive, transitive, ambitran-
sitive, and ditransitive verbs—see §4.2.1. Or they can be headed by a copula—see under
B §4.2.2.
   Copula clauses in Manambu contain polyfunctional verbs in their predicate slot. There
are ten such verbs, and they can each be used as copula verbs, as support verbs, and also as
auxiliaries. In addition, ﬁve of them are also used as lexical verbs. A summary of these verbs
and their functions is in Table 4.1.
   When used as copula verbs, they head the predicate of copula clauses which involve
two arguments but cannot be considered transitive or intransitive (see Dixon 2002b for a
typological overview of copulas; also see §17.1).
   The relationship between the two arguments of a copula clause—the copula subject and
the copula complement—covers identity, attribution, location, and possession. Their choice
depends on (a) the meaning of the copula construction, and (b) the semantic type of copula
complement.
   We saw, both in Table 4.1 and examples 4.16–19, that copula clauses containing copulas t@-
‘be, stand’, r @- ‘sit’, and kwa- ‘stay’ are used to express location and existence (also see T1.32,
T2.67, and T3.43, for t@-; T2.4 and T2.7 for r @-; and T1.11 and T1.14 for kwa-). A similar
example is at 20.30.
   The copula t@- —the most versatile in terms of its semantics—can also imply ‘coming into
existence’. The stative existential meaning and the more dynamic meaning of ‘appearing’ can
only be distinguished by context.
   Consider 20.27. Its ﬁrst clause (which is a relative clause) contains the existential copula
r @- ‘sit (overtone of horizontal position)’. This copula never has any overtone of ‘coming into
existence’. It is used here because living or staying in an area is typically associated with a
horizontal location and treated as ‘sitting’. This is reminiscent of classiﬁcatory verbs found in
some New Guinea languages—we saw, in §17.1.1, that despite some classiﬁcatory overtones,
positional verbs in Manambu cannot really be considered classiﬁcatory.
   The second clause of 20.27 contains the copula t@- meaning ‘become, come into being’. This
same clause may also mean ‘a lake was (there)’, but this is not the reading implied by the
context of the story.

      ‘In the area where we used to be (lit. sit) a lake came into being’
  The copula t@- is also used in the meaning of ‘become’, as in 3.8–9 and 20.28–9. These exam-
ples show that the copula complement of ‘become’ can be a noun (as in 20.28 and T2.42), or
an adjective (as in 20.29). In T1.8, the copula complement is a deictic adverb, atawa ‘like that’.

      dem.prox-masc.sg village that.is.why big-masc.sg become-act.foc-3masc.sgbas.vt
      ‘That is why this village has become big’
  It is also used in the meaning of ‘have’ with any kind of possessum, as in 4.18, 8.16, and
14.33. In T1.4 a clause with t@- can be interpreted either as existential (‘the sickness which
exists on/to us-our village women’) or as possessive (‘the sickness we-our village women have’).
  The verb t@- is not used to express identity or equation; neither are the two other postural
verbs. The verb kwa- ‘stay’ can be used in the meaning of ‘become and remain’, as shown in
the last clause in 20.30:
20.30 [ [ta:y waku-na-di]                   yibunmi-a:b a:li t@-na-di]              [samasa:m

      stay-1plsubj.vt+3fem.sgbas.vt-because
      ‘There are also four chiefs (lit. chiefs who go out ﬁrst), because we remain numerous’
  This is consistent with its lexical meaning of ‘staying’ and the way it is used in aspectual
complex predicates to express prolonged durative meaning.
  Other polyfunctional verbs used as copulas express identity and attribution. Their choice
depends on the copula complement and in fact is only partly predictable.
  As mentioned at B in §4.2.2, the copula verbs na- ‘be (of physical states; natural phenom-
ena)’, tay -‘be (of climatic states)’, yasa-/yas@- ‘be (of physical states, e.g. hunger, thirst)’, and
say- ‘be (of some states, e.g. shame or pins and needles)’ allow an additional option. They
can take third person feminine cross-referencing, with the experiencer optionally added if
appropriate. Examples are at 20.31a–34a. Or the experiencer can be cross-referenced on the
copula verb. Examples are at 20.31b–34b. There are no restrictions on the person of the
experiencer.
  Each of the examples at (a) in 20.31–2 allows for two interpretations, no matter whether the
overt experiencer is present or not (see §20.4.3 on ellipsis): they either refer to a general state
of aﬀairs, or to the feelings or state of an experiencer participant. Examples at (b) only refer
to the state of the experiencer. As always in Manambu, the overt NP can be omitted. The two
readings (i) and (ii) are equally frequent, and only context provides the clue. The person does
not have to be ‘I’—there are no restrictions on the person choice.
20.31a (wun) bwiyabwi na-na
       (I)       hot   be:nat-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt
       (i) ‘It is hot’
       (ii) ‘I am hot’
                                                                  20.1 Major constituents        52120.31b (wun) bwiyabwi na-na-wun
       (I)    hot     be:nat-act.foc-1fem.sgbas.vt
       ‘I am hot’
20.32a (wun) n@k@r tay-na
       (I)       cold be:clim-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt
       (i) ‘It is cold’
       (ii) ‘I am cold’
20.32b (wun) n@k@r tay-na-wun
       (I)    cold be:clim-act.foc-1fem.sgbas.vt
       ‘I am cold’
The preferential reading for example 20.33a is (i)—that is, these sentences refer to the feelings
of a particular experiencer (not necessarily ﬁrst person).
20.33a (wun) bag                    say-na
       (I)       pins.and.needles be:feel-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt
       (i) ‘I feel pins and needles’
       (ii) ‘It gives one a feeling of “pins and needles”; there is a feeling of “pins and needles” ’
20.33b (wun) bag                 say-na-wun
       I        pins.and.needles be:feel-act.foc-1fem.sgbas.vt
       ‘I feel pins and needles’
   And example 20.34a has only one reading—it can only refer to hunger (or other physical
feelings: see 4.26a–d):
20.34a (wun) ka:m yasa-na
       I      hunger be:desire-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt
       ‘I am hungry’
20.34b (wun) ka:m yasa-na-wun
       I      hunger be:desire-act.foc-1fem.sgbas.vt
       ‘I am hungry’
   In contrast, the meaning of the (b) examples at 20.31–4 is pretty uniform: ﬁrst, they always
imply the presence of an experiencer—cross-referenced on the verb—and secondly, the speaker
is focusing on the state of the experiencer—who is also topical. This is why it is underlined in
the translations.
   This is very similar to the alternations in cross-referencing we already saw in ‘body part
constructions’ many of which use the copula or polyfunctional verbs discussed here—see §17.4,
and especially examples 17.57–9. A similar example, with the word mawul ‘insides; feelings’,
appears in 14.87. Along similar lines, a normal way of saying ‘I am angry’ is 20.35a. This is
another example of a body part construction.
20.35a (wun) ya:l gra-na
       (I)    belly cry-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt
       ‘I am angry’
  If I want to focus on my anger, to make sure people understand that I am well and truly
angry, I would say:
20.35b (wun) ya:l gra-na-wun
       (I)    belly cry-act.foc-1fem.sgbas.vt
       ‘I am angry’
522      20 Clause Types and Discourse-Pragmatic Devices  In each of these cases, the choice of a pattern—whether to cross-reference an experiencer or
not—has repercussions on the use of switch-reference in clause chaining. We recall, from §18.3,
that body part constructions and copula clauses with these four verbs usually trigger diﬀerent
subject medial markers even if the experiencer is the same as the subject of a subsequent clause,
as in 18.24 and 20.36a:
20.36a [wus yasa-l@-k]                      [a-wa-j@wi]
       urine be:desire-3fem.sg-compl.ds impv-say-be.awake
       ‘If you feel like peeing wake (me up)’
  The independent clause alternative for the ﬁrst clause in 20.36a is 20.36b, where the experi-
encer is not cross-referenced on the copula verb.
20.36b (ñ@n)     wus yasa-na
       you.fem urine be:desire-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt
       ‘You feel like peeing’
This clause was used as a juxtaposed dependent clause in (i), a version of 20.36a:
20.36c [wus yasa-na]                          [a-wa-j@wi]
       urine be:desire-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt impv-say-be.awake
       ‘If you feel like peeing wake (me up)’
  However, as we saw in §18.3 (18.25–6), if the subject is topical, it can be treated as ‘same’ with
respect to switch-reference even within a body part construction. Such examples also occur
with copula verb structures illustrated in 20.31–4 above, but they are less frequent. Another
example is in 20.37.
20.37 [abakapi ata ka:m yasa-d]                           [ka:m yasa-ku,]    [ya:k]
      hawk     then hunger be:desire-3masc.sgbas.p hunger be:desire-compl.ss OK
      ‘The hawk then felt hunger, after he felt hunger, it was OK’
As we saw in 17.60, even if the experiencer is cross-referenced on the polyfunctional copula verb
yas@-/yasa- ‘be (of desires)’ in a main clause, it may not be cross-referenced on an adjacent
dependent clause. Another rare example of the experiencer cross-referenced on copula verb
within a dependent clause is at 20.63. We return to this phenomenon—rather pervasive in
Papuan languages—in §20.1.4.
   Unlike the four copula verbs discussed above, the verb yæy- ‘be: of smell’ does not refer to a
feeling by any particular experiencer; typical examples are at 4.28 and 20.38.
20.38 du-a-jig@r@pa            ya:m yæy-na
      man-lk-bodysmell+lk smell be:smell-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt
      ‘There is a smell of human body’
      ∗
        ‘I smell human body’, ∗ ‘I emit a smell’
  We already mentioned in §4.5 that the copula subject behaves like any other subject. In
contrast, the copula complement of any copula verb is diﬀerent from any other type of
argument. It can never be cross-referenced on the copula verb. A copula complement cannot
be case marked, or independently focused in a highlighting focus construction (§20.3).
  None of the copula clauses can form an imperative. The verbs t@-, r @-, and kwa- do form
imperatives when used in their positional senses (‘stand’, ‘sit’, and ‘stay’ respectively). The
copula na- ‘be: of physical states, natural phenomena’ can occur in a command phrased as a
                                                                20.1 Major constituents        523sequencing clause chain only if used as a support verb (see §17.2.3 and example 17.36a). Other
than that, copula clauses have all the properties of verbal clauses.
   We now turn to non-verbal clauses, that is, clauses which have a member of a word class
other than a verb in their predicate slot. We saw in §3.1 that non-verbs in the predicate slot
require nominal cross-referencing enclitics cross-referencing their subject (see Table 3.4). This
cross-referencing is not tense sensitive—that is, the tense distinctions expressed in verbs are not
marked for non-verbal predicates.
   As mentioned in §12.1, to express tense, aspect, or any other further categories, non-verbs
have to be used as complements of a support verb (most frequently, t@- ‘be, have, stand’). Also,
if a non-verbal clause is to be used in a depedent clause, the non-verbal predicate has to occur
with the support verb—see further discussion in §17.2.3.
   Non-verbal predicates are negated diﬀerently from verbs—see §14.1.2, and especially
Scheme 14.2. The negator ma: is postposed to the non-verb, and the person, number, and
gender cross-referencing enclitics are suppressed. We can recall that, to negate a non-future
declarative non-habitual verb, the same negator is preposed to a special negative verb form
stripped of any cross-referencing. And to negate a future declarative non-habitual verb, the
negator is postposed to the verb root (which is often diﬀerent from the negative non-future
form: see §14.1.1). These tense distinctions in negative declarative verbs are irrelevant for
negative non-verbs. Example 20.39 recapitulates these correlations: 20.39a is an example of
a non-future declarative negative verbal clause; 20.39b is the same example cast in the future;
and 20.39c is a non-verbal negative clause. The only feature declarative negative verbal and
non-verbal clauses share is the lack of personal cross-referencing.
20.39a ñan ma: t@
       child neg have+neg
       ‘(I/you/we/they etc.) do not/did not have a child’
20.39b ñan t@            ma:
       child have+neg neg
       ‘(I/you/we/they etc.) will not have a child’
20.39c vyak@t ma:
       good neg
       ‘(I/you/we/they/it etc.) is not/was not/will not be good’
  In 20.39d–e, vyak@t occurs with t@- as a support verb or as a copula (with the meaning of
‘become’)—and this support verb behaves as a normal verb, with all the appropriate tense and
other distinctions:
20.39d vyakat ma: t@
       good neg sup.vb+neg
       (a) ‘(I/you/we/they/it etc.) is not/was not good’—support verb
       (b) ‘(I/you/we/they/it etc.) does not/did not become good’—copula clause
20.39e vyakat t@              ma:
       good sup.vb+neg neg
       (a) ‘(I/you/we/they/it etc.) will not be good’—support verb
       (b) ‘(I/you/we/they/it etc.) will not become good’—copula clause
  We can recall, from §14.1.2 (also see the discussion above), that 20.39d–e are ambiguous in
yet another way: the verb t@- with a non-verb may also be understood as a copula, ‘become’.
524     20 Clause Types and Discourse-Pragmatic DevicesHence the reading (b) for each of 20.39d–e. Nothing but context can help us decide. Just like
copula clauses, non-verbal clauses are not used in commands.
  The subject of both copula and non-verbal clauses can occur in the highlighting focus
construction, just like any subject of an intransitive clause (S)—see §20.3.
  Cross-linguistically speaking, the meanings expressed with non-verbal clauses in Manambu
are, in the majority, associated with copula clauses—see Dixon (2002). We discuss them one by
one.
I. Identity and equation are illustrated in 20.40, and in T1.6, T1.16, T2.8, T2.24, and the
second clause of T2.27.
20.40 k@-di         du-adi
      dem.prox-pl man-3plnom
      ‘These (ones) were/are people’
  The subject can be omitted, as in 20.41.
20.41 wagi-adi
      eel-3plnom
      ‘They are eels’
  We can recall from §8.2 that an alternative to a construction with ‘have’ is what can be called
identiﬁcation construction whereby the possessor is the subject of a non-verbal clause, and
the possessed noun occupies the predicate slot. These constructions tend to be employed if the
possessive relationship is conceived of as a permanent one, as, for instance, belonging to a clan,
as in 8.21–5, clauses 6 and 7 of T2.27, and 20.42. In the last clause of T2.26 an ‘identiﬁcation
construction’ is cast as a question.
20.42 wun gabak-ad@wun-@k
      (I) Gabak.clan-1masc.sgnom-conf
      ‘I am a member of Gabak clan’
This is akin to predicative possession, further illustrated at 20.43–4.
II. Predicative possession and purpose are illustrated in 20.43–5. In 20.43, a headless posses-
sive marked with -k@- (see §8.1) heads the predicate; a similar example is at 8.14. The ‘double’
gender marking is discussed in §8.1.
20.43 d@-k@-l-al
      he-poss-fem.sg-3fem.sgnom
      ‘She is his (wife)’
  A predicative possessive construction can be used as an alternative to a clan-identiﬁcation
construction, with little semantic diﬀerence. The only diﬀerence is pragmatic: in 20.42 the
speaker fully identiﬁes with the clan, while 20.44 simply states the fact of the clan membership.
20.44 yabun kwalgud@mi d@ sablap gwalugw-@-k@-d-ad
      (name) (name)      he Sablap clan-lk-poss-masc.sg-3masc.sgnom
      ‘Yabun Kwalgud@mi, he is of Sablap clan’
  We recall, from 8.24, that the identiﬁcation construction is a preferred rhetorical device in a
name debate, where clan membership and the ensuing name ownership are of vital importance.
  In 20.45, a dative form, ‘for you’, heads the predicate:
                                                                20.1 Major constituents        52520.45 k@                  na:gw m@n-a:k-al
      dem.prox+fem.sg sago you.masc-lk+dat-3fem.sgnom
      ‘This sago is for you/yours’III. Naming illustrated in 20.46 can also be expressed with a non-verbal clause:
20.46 wun-a-d@     s@      ma: Sepaywus-ad
      I-lk-masc.sg name again Sepaywus-3masc.sgnom
      ‘My name, again, is Sepaywus’
  Agreement is with the ‘owner’ of the name. Unlike possessive noun phrases (§8.1.1), posses-
sor and not the possessee can be considered ‘head’ here.
IV. Attribution is consistently expressed through non-verbal clauses with an adjective, a
number or a quantiﬁer in the predicate slot, as in 20.47, 20.26, and 20.39c above.
20.47 du viti-ab@r
      man two-3dunom
      ‘Men were/are two’V. Similarity is also expressed with non-verbal clauses. Any word class marked with the suﬃx
-p@k ‘like’ or -r@b ‘fully like’ (see §9.2) or a noun followed by the postposition k@t@k ‘like, as’
(§4.5.2) can occupy the predicate slot, as in T1.5 and 20.48.
20.48 l@-k@              amæy-p@k-al
      she-poss+fem.sg mother-like-3fem.sgnom
      ‘She is like her mother’
  The suﬃx -r@b does not necessarily require nominal cross-referencing: as shown in 9.29, a
noun with -r@b can occupy the predicate slot without any marking. Consider 20.49a and b
which are almost synonymous. The diﬀerence is slight: 20.49a was used as a general statement
pronounced after a lengthy discussion of what the Gala language is like. In contrast, 20.49b
was an immediate reaction to a few rather striking cognates between Gala and Manambu:
20.49a ñan-a kudi-r@b-a
       we-lk language-fully-3fem.sgnom
       ‘This is fully like our language’ (a general statement based on a lengthy discussion)
20.49b ñan-a kudi-r@b
       we-lk language-fully
       ‘This is fully like our language’ (a spontaneous statement based on a couple of cog-
       nates)
   These two examples represent diﬀerent structures: 20.49b and 9.29 are verbless clauses—see
below.
   Non-verbal clauses can also be used for pointing, as in T1.14, bap ka (moon
dem.prox+3fem.sgnom) ‘This is the moon’. This is only possible if a nominal demonstrative
is in the predicate slot. Otherwise a verbless clause is the preferred option.
   Non-verbal clauses feature prominently in highlighting focus constructions—see §20.3.
   A special subtype of non-verbal clauses is clauses whose predicate is a manner adver-
bial demonstrative or a reactivated topic demonstrative. As we saw in §§10.2.2–3, each
of these takes the predicative marker -n(-). The adverbial demonstrative takes -n- accom-
panied by third person feminine singular nominal cross-referencing, as in akatawa-n-a
526      20 Clause Types and Discourse-Pragmatic Devices(like.this.anaph-pred-3fem.sgnom) ‘this is it, this is how it is’. And a reactivated topic demon-
strative takes -n accompanied with its copy marked for number and gender, e.g. aka-n-aka
(dem.dist.react.top.fem.sg-pred-react.top.fem.sg) ‘that is it’. Another example is at 20.52b.
   If a clause with an adverbial demonstrative is negated, the predicative marker is omitted, e.g.
akatawa ma: ( (like.this.anaph neg) ‘this is not like this’). To negate a clause with a reactivated
topic in its predicate slot one uses a biclausal structure, with the pro-clause ma: ‘it is not
the case’, as a separate clause, e.g. aka-n-aka [pause] ma: (react.top.dem.dist.fem.sg-pred-
react.top.fem.sg neg) ‘that is it—no’, meaning ‘this is not at all the case’. This is very similar
to how ma: was used in 14.152–4 (§14.6), also to negate clauses.
   Neither the adverbial demonstratives nor the reactivated topic demonstratives can occur
with a support verb. Nor can they occur in any dependent clause; or be used in the highlighting
focus construction (§20.3). These properties are similar to those of verbless clauses—our next
topic.
   Verbless clauses contain no verb and no cross-referencing. No tense-aspect distinctions can
be expressed; these clauses cannot be employed in clause chaining, or as complement clauses.
They are negated in the same way as non-verbal clauses: with postposed negator ma:. Unlike
copula clauses, no constituent can be in highlighting focus.
   The word classes employed in verbless clause are rather limited. The semantic types covered
include:
i. Naming and identity can be expressed with a verbless clause, as in 20.50a–b, and T2.1.
20.50a wun Walin@m
       I     Walinum
       ‘I am Walinum’
20.50b wun-a       s@    Walin@m
       I-lk+fem.sg name Walinum
       ‘My name is Walinum’
Identity expressed with a verbless clause involves a clan name (or associated totems) or a
kinship name in the second position (as in the ﬁrst clause of T2.1 and the third clause of
T2.27, and 20.51). Using any other word class there would be awkward.
20.51 wun d@makau       kanukaraki
      I    brown.snake death.adder
      ‘I am brown snake, death adder’ (that is, I belong to a clan whose totems are brown
      snake and death adder)
   We saw in 20.46 above that a non-verbal clause can be used for naming. In fact, 20.46 (‘my
name, again, is Sepaywus’) and the ﬁrst clause of T2.1 (‘I am father’s brother, Sepay’) were
used by the same person, for diﬀerent stories. Another possibility would be to use a non-verbal
clause in the meaning of identity: wun S@paywus-ad@wun (I Sepaywus-1masc.sgnom) ‘I am
Sepaywus’. Verbless clauses are statistically the most frequent choice for people introducing
themselves as story tellers—a slightly unusual situation in itself, given that all the listeners nor-
mally already know who the people are. A non-verbal clause appears to be more appropriate
if one says one’s name to an unfamiliar audience. But this is hardly a steadfast rule.
ii. Pointing is expressed with non-verbal clauses only if a reactivated topic demonstrative
appears in the predicate slot, to bring back a topical participant. The context is always that
of an immediate reaction—this is it, here and now, as in T2.25 and 20.52a. In conversations the
object is pointed at with a hand.
                                                                20.1 Major constituents     52720.52a ñ@n-a                 kamna:gw k@ka
       you.fem-lk+fem.sg food            dem.prox.react.top.fem.sg
       ‘Here is your food’ (pointing) (I have just put it here; it is here right now)
An alternative would be a predicative form of a reactivated topic demonstrative, as in 20.52b.
The implication is that the food has been here for some time, and its place is here.
20.52b ñ@n-a                 kamna:gw k@ka-n-aka
       you.fem-lk+fem.sg food         dem.prox.react.top.fem.sg-pred-react.top.fem.sg
       ‘Here is your food’ (pointing)
  We have already seen (20.49b) that a verbless clause may have an overtone of spontaneity. It
appears to be also the case in instances like 20.52a.
iii. Summarizing a preceding stretch of discourse can be achieved through using an adverbial
demonstrative on its own, in a verbless clause (and without a predicative marker), as in 20.53a.
An alternative is to use the word ‘manner’ in a similar structure—another verbless clause:
20.53a akatawa
       thus
       ‘This is how it is’
20.53b akatawa sa:d
       thus     way
       ‘This way (it is)’
   An alternative for each of these would be either a predicative form of adverbial demonstra-
tive (akatawa-n-a for 20.53a), or a non-verbal clause (akatawa sa:d-a for 20.53b). The verbless
versions sound more spontaneous and informal.
iv. Verbless clauses are used in a presentational function, as in T1.2.
v. Verbless clauses are used in questions (see C below) which involve manner and are marked
with the question words ata ata ‘how how’, as in 10.100, and agula ‘what’s up; what for; why’,
as in 10.98. Verbless clauses are also employed in questions involving naming, as in 10.102 and
20.54:
20.54 ata maway s@?
      how ﬂower name
      ‘What’s the name of the ﬂower?’
  Verbless clauses are also used in short questions used to enquire after someone: 20.55 is the
way of asking a child about his or her mother and father—that is, where they are, are they OK,
and so on:
20.55 amæy? asa:y?
      mother father
      ‘(What about) mother? Father?’
  A similar example is at 20.58—this is a question addressed to unknown beings in order to
ﬁnd out what food they would be capable of eating.
  The interrogative pronoun ak@- ‘where’ (as in Table 10.7, example 10.90) is used in non-
verbal clauses, since it requires non-verbal cross-referencing.
  If negated, verbless clauses are indistinguishable from non-verbal ones: 20.56 is a negative
version of both a non-verbal clause l@ T@k@ta:y-a (she Teketay-3fem.sgnom) ‘she is Teketay’
and a verbless clause l@ T@k@ta:y ‘she is Teketay’:
528     20 Clause Types and Discourse-Pragmatic Devices20.56 l@ T@k@ta:y ma:
      she Teketay neg
      ‘She is not Teketay’
   Table 20.1 summarizes the properties which diﬀerentiate between copula clauses, verbless
clauses, and two types of clauses with non-verbal predicates—those involving demonstratives
with the predicative marker -n- and the rest.
   The arguments in favour of considering non-verbal clauses as a separate type of clauses
headed by non-verbs are: (a) kind of cross-referencing markers used, or lack thereof; (b)
negation; (c) tense distinctions expressed with cross-referencing; (d) occurrence in subordinate
clauses and in non-indicative moods; (e) semantics; (f) use in highlighting focus constructions;
and (g) constituent order.
   Unlike copula clauses—which are similar to normal verbal clauses in all but their (lack of)
capacity to form commands—they are negated in the same, non-verbal, way, and have a strictly
subject-predicate order (see §20.2). Clauses with adverbial and reactivated topic demonstratives
in the predicate slot share more properties with verbless clauses than they do with non-verbal
clauses.
   But how do we identify grammatical relations, especially in verbless clauses? This is to be
taken up in §20.1.4.
B. Imperative clauses are always independent, and contain partially inﬂected imperative-
permissive forms discussed in §13.2. Copula clauses, clauses with non-verbal predicates, and
verbless clauses cannot occur in imperative clauses. Some verbs—such as perception verbs—
have a telic meaning when used in commands; that is, 20.57 can only mean ‘you listen’ rather
than ‘you hear’ or ‘you understand’. (A loan verb understand was used in a command urging a
child to understand what the mother was saying and to act accordingly, in 17.26b.) We return
to the ways in which ‘see’ and ‘hear’ are used in commands in §21.1.2.
   The ways in which imperatives can be negated were addressed in §14.4. An imperative
strategy can be used in lieu of an imperative-permissive form—see Table 19.5, to express
additional overtones to do with strength of the command.
   The constituent order in imperative clauses follows the same principles as that in declarative
clauses (see §20.2): it is predominantly verb ﬁnal, but a constituent can be postposed to the
verb for disambiguation or if the participant is unexpected (see T1.16).
   Imperative clauses have a rising intonation on the verb, if they imply a command, and even
if used as a turn-taking device, as in 20.57.
20.57 b@r     awuk
      you.du impv+listen
      ‘You (two) listen!’
Permissive forms (see §13.2.2), which are often used in turn taking, tend to be pronounced with
an interrogative rising intonation—see C below.
C. Interrogative clauses correspond to either polar or content questions. We mentioned in
§10.4 that content questions are marked with a question word and slightly rising intonation,
while polar questions are marked by intonation only. There is no structural diﬀerence between
a positive polar question and a corresponding statement. Only the intonation and the context
decides. Some examples are at 10.79 and further examples in §10.4, 20.14–15, the last clauses of
T1.4 and T1.18, and the ﬁrst clause of T1.14. The last clause of T2.26 contains an ‘identiﬁcation
construction’ cast as a question.

530     20 Clause Types and Discourse-Pragmatic Devices  The only instances of positive clauses with exclusively interrogative reading are short one-
noun-phrase-long questions cast as verbless clauses. These are used to enquire after someone,
as in 20.55 and 20.58 (which contains a relative clause).
20.58 [ [b@r n@b@ k@-k@-bra]                           [k@k@pa:t] ]
      you.du able eat-fut-2dusubj.vt+3fem.sgbas.vt food
      ‘(What about) food you two will be able to eat?’
   These clauses would not make sense as declarative verbless clauses, since—as we saw in A
above—verbless declarative clauses contain at least two independent NPs.
   Polar questions display the same patterns of constituent order as do declarative clauses: 13.56
is an example of an oblique, ‘with them’, placed after the verb (see §20.2). Content questions
also display the same patterns.
   A question word does not have a ﬁxed position in a clause. It tends to gravitate towards the
beginning of the clause or to appear immediately before the verb, as in 10.87–8, T1.5, T1.30,
and T3.8. The only exceptions are verbless clauses involving the question word ata ata ‘how
how’ as in 10.100–2, and agula ‘what’s up; what for; why’ (10.98): here the constituent order is
ﬁxed.
   The pronoun s@ ‘who?’ is unlike other interrogative words in that it takes the linker -k@- in
order to combine with case markers. It is obligatorily marked for highlighting focus if in the
subject position. And if it is used as predicate head, as in 10.82, or is marked for focus, as in
10.83, and 20.59, its form is reminiscent of a headless associative NP (as illustrated in 8.14):
it takes gender-number markers -l- ‘feminine’, -d- ‘masculine’, -bra- ‘dual’, and -di- ‘plural’,
followed by a nominal predicate cross-referencing enclitic.
20.59 s@-k@-l-al                m@n-a:k    kwatiya-l
      who-obl-fem.sg-3fem.sgnom you-lk+dat give.to.nonthird.p-3fem.sgbas.p
      ‘Who gave it to you?’
Examples like 20.59–60 can be interpreted as instances of obligatory grammaticalized focus,
not infrequent in content interrogatives worldwide. We will see, at §20.3 below, that a focused
constituent can only rarely be in the A function.
   The interrogative ‘who’ can be marked for double focus; then the nominal cross-referencing
is repeated. The meaning is highly contrastive: ‘who is it really?’ (see §20.3). In 20.60, the
speaker is wondering whether the mysterious person who had entered his house is a man or a
woman.
20.60 [s@-k@-d-ad-ad                                 k@-d@              wun-a-d@
      who-obl-masc.sg-3masc.sgnom-3masc.sgnom dem.prox-masc.sg I-lk-masc.sg

      house+lk+loc sit-act.foc-2masc.sgbas.vt or sit-act.foc-2fem.sgbas.vt
      ‘Who is it really, you (man) (who) are staying in this house of mine? Or you (woman)
      who are staying?’
A clause may consist just of a question word, as in the last clause of T1.23. And any verbal
form, including the permissive (13.10), can occur in a question.
  When negated, both content and polar questions take the negative dependent clause marker
-ma:r- if they contain a verb—see 14.127–30. However, as we saw in §14.5.2, this is not the only
option. Many speakers (and especially young and innovative ones) use negative declarative
forms in negative questions, as in 14.131 and 14.151. If a negative question contains a non-
verbal or a verbless clause, it has the same structure as its positive counterpart:
                                                                   20.1 Major constituents         53120.61 k@                 kamna:gw vyakat ma:
      dem.prox.fem.sg food        good neg
      ‘Is this food not good?’  Further issues, including the patterns of response to negative questions, were discussed in
§14.5.2.","[545, 546, 547, 548, 549, 550, 551, 552, 553, 554, 555, 556, 557, 558]"
" Bragge (1990: 49) calculates that the approximate date of establishment of Avatip and
Malu could be between 1860 and 1870. This only partly agrees with Harrison’s (1993: 30)
                                                        1.5 Linguistic aﬃliation and prehistory             23observations that ‘Asiti was abandoned at the end of the eighteenth century or early in the
nineteenth’; he estimates dates of founding of Avatip and Malu as ‘some seven generations
ago’ (1993a: 17). An old lady in Avatip (who died in the early 1970s) appeared to have been
only four generations removed from Asiti.
   The story of Yuanab appears to be more intricate. According to some (Harrison 1993: 30),
after the foundation of Avatip, some colonists moved upriver and established the village of
Malu; others migrated still further upstream and settled there with an autochthonous people
to form the village of Yuanab. This is corroborated by oral histories collected by Bragge
(1990)—the origin stories collected by him among the Yuanab people ‘tell of the wandering
ancestors gathering together’ and acquiring a new language—Manambu—for them to use.
Nauwi Sauinambi (a Kwoma man from Bangwis) reports that ‘Yambon [Yuanab] came from
up near Swagup and Alakai, some came from Garamambu. They did not paddle canoes’
(Bragge 1990: 37).
   This suggests that the Yuanab people originally consisted of a number of groups—not
necessarily all speaking one language—‘forced together into a simple village situation by the
Manambu threat’ (37). This ‘language shift’ is dated by Bragge (1990: 48) as having occurred in
about 1830. Originally, the Yuanab-dwellers were ‘dry-land’ people, only recently ‘converted’ to
be river people. This may explain a somewhat aloof attitude of the people of Avatip and Malu
to those from Yuanab. And we can recall, from §1.4, that, according to Paul Badaybæg, after
the Gala wars some of the Gala people hid in Yuanab: this points towards some kind of Gala
substratum in Yuanab. After the end of the S@ruali M@gunay—that is, Gala—war (see §1.4),
the Malu people are said to have destroyed Yuanab, with only two or three people surviving.
   An alternative version is that the Yuanab people abandoned their village and went oﬀ to
bush camps. The next waves of migration to Yuanab came from a Iatmul (Ñaula) speaking
village of Japandai in the early twentieth century (Bragge 1990: 41–6); as a result of arguments
between the new arrivals and the Yuanab people, an armed conﬂict erupted; the Malu people
came to help and took the Yuanab people ‘up to their present village site and set them up there’
(41). It may have been at that stage that Yuanab ‘acknowledged its position as a Manambu
village’.
   The presence of varying substrata is probably what accounts for more pronounced dialectal
diﬀerences between Yuanab and the rest than between, say, Malu and Avatip.
   In the absence of written documents, dating of historical events has to rely on genealogies,
and the information obtained can be contradictory. We saw that the dates for the S@ruali
M@gunay wars vary from early to late nineteenth century. All we can say with assurance is
that the major migrations of the Manambu into more or less their present location within the
area of Ambunti mountain took place in the nineteenth century.
   What do we know about their more remote history? According to the tradition, the
three clans of the Manambu came from three mythical ancestral villages, called saki-t@p
(totemic.ritual-village). 14 The totemic ancestors of the Gla:gw lived near the Yentschang-
gai/Lapanggai areas. The totemic ancestors of the Wulwi-Ñawi lived in a village far to the
east—which, according to some, is the reason why the Wulwi-Ñawi totemically own the
eastward areas, including Australia and places the white people come from, as well as
the ‘white people’s objects’. The word for ‘east’ is wali, also used for ‘white people’. The totemic
ancestors of the Nabul-Sablap lived further to the west, in the direction of the sea (and perhaps  14 Young Manambu men—orators in training—equate the three ancestral villages, Asiti, Maukabu, and
Garaikwali—with the three mythical villages from which the three clan groups had originated. This is the way in
which ethnohistory-in-the-making is now evolving.
24       1 Introductioneven on the coast). They are the ones who ‘carved’ the Sepik River, whose source remains in
their ancestral village (also see Harrison 1990a: 45).
   This may imply that, historically, the Manambu could have consisted of at least three groups
merged together, one of which used to be located towards the coast. This may also explain a
few curious similarities between Manambu and Oceanic languages (see §22.3). But nothing can
be stated with full assurance.
   Diﬀerent subclans of the Manambu, and sometimes even the same subclan in diﬀerent
villages, claim diﬀerent migration routes. The Nagud@u of Avatip say that their ancestors came
from far up the Screw River, in the direction of the Abelam; while the Nagud@u of Yuanab
describe their ancestral ‘home’ as the south-west shore of Lake Chambri (Newton 1971: 64).
This is similar to the ways in which diﬀerent Gala ‘wards’ claim diﬀerent places of origin (see
§1.5.1). This may well reﬂect various layers of population mix and perhaps subsequent language
shifts and unknown substrata, which may be held responsible for the linguistic complexity of
modern Manambu.
   The question of an overall proto-home of the Ndu people remains open. There are indi-
cations of the migrations of some of the Ndu-speaking peoples (Gala) from the north-east
towards the Washkuk Hills. According to Roscoe (1994: 74), ‘it does seem probable that
the early Sepik-Ramu population spawned the ancestors of the Ndu-speaking groups now
spread across the lands from the Middle Sepik to the northern mountains and that these
proto-Ndu arrived ﬁrst in the Middle Sepik region, quite possibly in what is now the Sawos
territory’. However, the exact route of migration is impossible to ascertain, until more archae-
ological and linguistic studies of the surrounding groups are undertaken. 15 The story about
two Manambu brothers carving the Sepik River may suggest the arrival of the Ndu people
by water before the recession of the inland sea, rather than on foot. (The Middle Sepik
River is thought to be the remnant of a vast inland sea which is believed to have reached
its maximum extent between about 5000 and 6500 bc, and was inﬁlled by about 1000 bc:
Chappell 2005: 535–6; Paul Roscoe p.c.) Roscoe (1994: 74; p.c.) points out that ‘the balance
of evidence suggests that the Ndu presence in the Middle Sepik is ancient rather than recent
and that the ancestors of the Abelam and Boiken began moving north many hundreds of years
ago’.
   That is, the proto-home of at least some Ndu peoples could have been the Middle Sepik area.
This requires further study.
                                      1.6 l i n g u i s t i c s i t uat i o nCurrently, Manambu—called by the speakers ‘village language’ (t@p-a kudi) or Manambu
language (Mana:b@ kudi)—is the main language of the ﬁve villages on the Sepik River. It
is used in most homes, especially by older generations (50–80 years of age), and during
traditional ceremonies, such as name debates and the mortuary feast (§1.3.1). At present, there
are no Manambu monolinguals; just a few old ladies, including Gemaj (see Plate 6) are more
comfortable speaking Manambu than Tok Pisin.
   Children’s early socialization starts in Tok Pisin (see §22.4). Most parents in the villages
speak to their children in Manambu as well as Tok Pisin; however, Tok Pisin is the preferred  15 Errors in Foley’s (2005a) linguistic data invalidate his conclusions concerning the interrelationships between the
languages of the Sepik area (§22.2.1).
                                                                   1.6 Linguistic situation      25means of communication between children of all ages. A few women in Avatip come from
other areas of New Guinea, and communicate with their peers, and children, in Tok Pisin. This
enhances the frequency of Tok Pisin, and now also of Papua New Guinea English. Most church
services are conducted mostly in Tok Pisin, with inserts from Papua New Guinea English, and
from Manambu. I attended several SDA church meetings which were mostly in Manambu;
later on I was told that this was done ‘for my sake’.
   Most Manambu who live in towns maintain the language as a means of home communica-
tion. However, their children tend to be proﬁcient just in English, with little knowledge of Tok
Pisin, and even less of Manambu. When these children go back to the village, during school
holidays, the amount of English in the villages soars.
   That is, the overall degree of intrusion of Tok Pisin and English into village life looks
threatening—no wonder many older people complain that the language is doomed and bound
to go (this is comparable to the situation in Taiap described by Kulick 1992). We return to the
prospects for the survival of the language in §22.6.
   Traditional multilingualism now survives mostly in the folk memory. As we saw in §1.4, the
Iatmul (Ñaula) used to be traditional trade partners of a number of the Manambu clans (see
Harrison 1990a: 69–72). These links were based on (a) trade exchange, and (b) shared cultural
practices. Within Manambu clans traditional initiation ceremonies and debates (thoroughly
described by Harrison 1990a) involved ‘trading’ incantations and spells in the closely related
(but far from mutually intelligible) Iatmul. Representatives of older generations—especially
men who achieved high degrees of initiation—used to have a very good knowledge of this
language. A Iatmul inﬂuence is reﬂected in the special ‘shadowy’ style in traditional songs (see
§22.3). Younger people know much less Iatmul.
   Further language knowledge involved traditional trade partners. Older people used to know
the languages of their neighbours and trade partners, especially Kwoma (also see Bowden
1997: xx). This knowledge is drastically diminished among the younger generation. This
gradual disintegration of traditional multilingual patterns, and the increase in knowledge of
the main lingua francas—Tok Pisin, and English—is a worrying sign of traditional language
endangerment on a global scale (see Aikhenvald 2002b).
   Avatip has a primary school (years 1–7), currently with 245 students and 12–13 teachers
(a few of them from other communities: for instance, one is an Arapesh). The headmaster,
Leo Yabwi Luma, is highly competent and proﬁcient in Manambu language and lore. Most
schooling is in Papua New Guinea English together with Tok Pisin. A Manambu vernacular
language programme is under way. Manambu alphabetization materials are created by teachers
themselves. Plate 5 features Tanina Ala displaying one of the posters relating to a story about
‘mother pig’ used in the Avatip school in 2002–3. The primary school in Yawabak (years 1–3)
currently has a vernacular teaching programme; and apparently so does a primary school in
Malu.
   A major problem for teaching Manambu at school is the existing orthography. The orthog-
raphy proposed by SIL missionaries was primarily based on the Yuanab variety which distin-
guishes just one liquid r rather than r and l as in Malu and Avatip (Farnsworth and Farnsworth
1975). The orthography distinguishes all the other consonant phonemes (digraph ny is used for
the palatal ñ). The orthography distinguishes only four vowels rather than nine (see §2.1.2). The
vowels are written as a for /a/, uw for /u/, iy for /i /, and aa for either /a:/ or a sequence /aPa/
(see §2.1.2, on how older speakers pronounce long vowel a: as a sequence of identical vowels
interrupted by a glottal stop). The symbol i is used for @. People complain that this writing
system is bulky—and avoid writing Manambu.
26     1 Introduction   Alternative orthographies have been emerging spontaneously over the years. One exemplar
of this is a story by an elder, Daniel Takendu (1977). The writing system is basically phonetic:
some automatically prenasalized consonants are written as such (d as nd, b as mb, and so on),
and some are not; i is used for @, and also for i , and a double vowel is used for long a:. Palatal
ñ is written as ny. Double consonants appear in stressed syllables. Most enclitics and some
suﬃxes are written as independent words.
   The way Manambu was written in Takendu’s story about the Gala war (1977: 3) is illustrated
in 1.1 (the ﬁrst line of a story about the Gala war). The second line represents the phonological
transcription adopted throughout this grammar.

    ‘In that village that they call Ambunti, there is Makemawi (Ambunti mountain), (this is
    the) name of a ritual oﬃcer’    The orthography used in the primary school programme in Avatip (see Plate 5) combines
features of Takendu’s (1977) with those of Farnsworth and Farnsworth’s (1975) proposals (that
is, iy for i , and uw for u, as in duw ‘man’ rather than du). Enclitics are written as separate words.
The sequence of a labialized consonant gw followed by a schwa @ is marked as gu. Prenasalized
stops are sometimes written as simple stops (as in baal /ba:l/ ‘pig’), and other times as sequences
with a nasal, as in kwarimbaam /kwarba:m/ ‘in the jungle’ and giramb /grab/ ‘afternoon’. A
sample with a corresponding phonological transcription and gloss is in 1.2 below:

    ‘I am mother pig, I live in the bush, I have four children, I never sleep day and night’   Perceived inconsistencies and the unwieldiness of the orthographic conventions suggested
by the Farnsworths are a matter of concern for many literate Manambu. There is currently an
interest in developing a new, community-based, orthography.
   The importance of such orthography approved by a consensus of well-respected Manambu
cannot be underestimated: if people start writing their language, this may ultimately diminish
the expansion of Tok Pisin into functional domains reserved for Manambu. For the time being,
the Manambu language is considered ‘diﬃcult to write’.
   Throughout this grammar, all the examples are presented in the phonological transcription
based on the analysis in Chapter 2.

1887, when the members of the New Guinea Company Scientiﬁc Expedition under Schrader,
Hollrung, Schneider, and Hunstein sailed up the Sepik River on board the steamer Samoa
(Zöller 1891: 367–8; Hahl 1980: 126). Zöller (1891: 367) reports that the members of the
scientiﬁc expedition had stayed in a camp at Malu between 22 August and 7 November.
Dr Schrader collected ‘68 words from Zenáp-dialects, 26 words of Mangi-dialects spoken to
the west from it, 132 words from the Malu dialect, 25 words of the neighbouring Yamboni-
dialect [Yambon, or Yuanab, variety], and a further 12 words from a village which lies
further down the river “in the grasshills” ’ (Zöller 1891: 367–8). We have no information on
the nature of this ﬁrst contact, or the ways in which the language data were collected. The
combined wordlist was published by Zöller (1891: Appendix, item 18), under the heading
Augustaﬂuss (Sepik River). It is presented in Appendix 1.1. As shown in the Appendix, sixty-
seven words and expressions are recognizably Manambu, and are presumably from the Malu
dialect.
   Seventeen words in the list are identiﬁable as Western Iatmul. I hypothesize that they
belong to what Zöller calls ‘Yamboni-dialect’, and perhaps reﬂect a dialect of Western Iatmul
spoken where Brugnowi is located now (next to Yuanab/Yambon). Six of these are shared
between Iatmul and Manambu. Five words are similar to Kwoma: this may have been the
language from a Grass Hills village. A further sixty-eight are problematic. Six words are
identiﬁable as Chenapian (note that the materials on Chenapian, published in Laycock and
Z""graggen 1975: 744, are extremely limited). What is meant by ‘Mangi-dialect’ remains a
mystery.
   Zöller’s materials are quoted in Schmidt (1902: 70), under the heading of Sprachen vom
Augustaﬂuss, that is, Languages of the Sepik. He points out the impossibility of making
any deﬁnite pronouncements based on the limited data available, and notes the presence of
repetition in the colour terms nüggi-nüggi ‘red’ (ñiki-ñiki lit. blood-blood) and laggi-galagi
‘yellow’ (lit. laki-ka-laki ginger-intensive-ginger, ‘green’); these forms, still in use in Manambu,
are discussed in §4.3.3 below.
   Behrmann (1922: 178) mentions the greeting kubiaai (k@p@yay), but does not provide any
wordlist. Adolf Roesicke (1914), also a member of the expedition, collected vocabularies, part
                                                                             ´
of which he cites to illustrate the fact that the language spoken ‘from T āmbunum                  ´
                                                                                          to Jāmānŭm
           ´
and Tschĕbandei’      (which is identical with Iatmul) is relatively similar to another language,
spoken in ‘Awatíb, Mālu and Jambŭn’  ´ (that is, Manambu) (508–9). The Manambu part of this
illustrative list is given in Appendix 1.1. 16
   Malu as a group of languages distinct from Iatmul was recognized by Loukotka (1957: 29–
30): ‘Málu. Un petit groupe de langues vers l’ouest. Le Málu est parlé dans un village du même
nom sur le Sepik [Kluge 1938: 176], le Tuo dans un autre village de la même région [Schmidt
1901; 1902], l’Ambunti dans un autre village encore et l’Awatib aussi dans un village /pour les
deux: néant/.’ 17
   16 The full vocabulary has not been located so far. Ulrike Claas (p.c.) suggests that it must have been destroyed
during the Second World War.
   17 Málu. A small group of languages towards the west. Málu is spoken in a village with the same name on the
Sepik River [Kluge 1938: 176], Tuo (is spoken) in another village of the same region [Schmidt 1901; 1902], Ambunti
(is spoken) in one other village, and Awatip is also (spoken) in one village /for both: nothing/.
28     1 Introduction   The ﬁrst missionaries of the Summer Institute of Linguistics to set foot in the Manambu
villages were Janet Dodson (later Allen) and Phyllis Walker (later Hurd) (1962–3). They pro-
duced a sketch of Manambu phonology (Allen and Hurd 1972) based on the Yuanab variety
(also quoted in Pike 1964). Pauline Yuaneng Luma Laki recalls their visit to her house in
Avatip in the early 1960s: they were the ﬁrst white people she had ever seen, and the experience
was scary. They were then replaced by Robin and Marva Farnsworth (1963–80), 18 who worked
mainly in Yuanab (though their major collaborator, Ken Nayau, is from Avatip). (The ﬁrst
survey wordlist collected by Robin Farnsworth in Yuanab [Yambon] is dated 31 December
1964.)
   Robin Farnsworth authored a number of papers (1966, 1975, 1976) on Manambu pro-
nouns and demonstratives, phrases and clauses, and translation problems. Farnsworth and
Farnsworth produced a grammar sketch (1966), and ‘Essentials for translation’ (n.d.), as a
prerequisite for their translation work, in addition to an orthography proposal (1975) and
phonology data (1981?). Marva Farnsworth compiled a number of collections of stories (e.g.
1971, Nyana maaj ‘our speech’), and a draft wordlist (n.d.), in addition to a few booklets
for literacy work and stories (mostly biblical). The Bible, God diki lapa nyig (lit. God his
banana leaf), was published by the SIL, Ukarumpa, in 1979, and dedicated in 1980. On the
request of the Manambu people, a revision of this preliminary translation started in 2001,
with the help of Marva and Robin Farnsworth, and their major collaborator Ken Nayau;
it is currently being undertaken by several groups of Manambu themselves, including Ken
Nayau.
   The phonological analysis of Manambu (based on the Yuanab variety) by Farnsworth
and Farnsworth (1981?) is similar to that in Allen and Hurd (1972): it postulates three
vowel phonemes (i , a, and a:), whose allophones (@, 1, and u; we will see in §2.1.2 that @,
u, and also æ are in fact distinct phonemes) depend on the consonantal environment. This
over-parsimonious analysis resulted in the creation of a complicated orthography (§1.6). The
grammatical analysis is mostly cast in a rather inscrutable tagmemic framework; many of the
paradigms are partial.
   A sketch grammar of Manambu by Laycock (1965: 120–31) contains some partial pronom-
inal paradigms and is on the whole very shallow. The materials obtained, and the ﬁeldwork
methodology, are problematic: the sketch is based on a short span of work with a consultant
who worked as a medical assistant at the Ambunti hospital, while ‘a previous informant . . . was
dismissed after one morning’s work as unsatisfactory’. Despite the statement that both consul-
tants were from Malu, the wordlist contains a number of Yuanab features, which may be due
to dialect mixing. His claim that there are no dialectal diﬀerences between Avatip, Malu, and
Yuanab [Yambon] is incorrect (see §22.6). The language is said to have three vowels, a, @, and 2.
In his 1991 paper, Laycock postulated the existence of a long vowel a: for all the Ndu languages,
including Manambu.
   Harrison (1990a) and (1993) contain a wealth of lexical items, phrases, and sentences
in Manambu, in addition to incisive observations about such aspects of Manambu seman-
tics as the concept of mawul ‘insides; location of emotions’ and kayik ‘image, shadow’
(§21.4).","[49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55]"
"
A. ‘Seeing’
The verb v@- means ‘see’, ‘look’, and also ‘try (often by taste or touch)’ and ‘experience’. This
verb has a somewhat unusual argument structure. We can recall, from §7.3, that in its meaning
‘see, look’, it is transitive, and its O is unmarked for case if indeﬁnite or not ‘seen’ completely. If
the object is fully seen and the action is volitional and/or telic (meaning ‘look (at)’, or ‘see well’),
the object is marked with accusative-locative, as in 7.21. But in the meanings ‘look around for’
and ‘see, notice’, the object is marked with dative, as in 7.22 and 7.28.
   The O in the meaning of non-volitional and uncontrolled experience is unmarked, as in 7.16
and 21.7. This was an answer to 7.23, a question about the age of Duamakwa:y, the oldest man
in the Manambu communities, at the time when he had met Dangwan (one of the Manambu
interpreters for Behrmann’s 1912–13 expedition to the Ambunti area).
21.7 wun wasa-yuwi          b@      v@-d@wun,             b@      v@-d@wun
     I      cheek+lk-hair already see-1masc.sgbas.p already see-1masc.sgbas.p
     ‘I already shaved, already shaved’ (lit. I already experienced beard)
   The same meaning of v@- occurs in T2.56 (‘experience body/skin’ means ‘have sex’).
   The expression yig@n v@- refers to dreaming—it can be understood either as ‘seeing a dream’
or ‘experiencing a dream’. The polysemy of v@- as ‘see, look’ and ‘experience’ is what makes
Text 1 hilarious for Manambu speakers: it is centred around the expression bap v@- (moon
see/look/experience) which is a conventional way of referring to women’s menstruation as
‘experiencing the moon sickness’. A stupid young man—the main character of Text 1—does
not know this, and understands this expression literally, as ‘looking at the moon’, or ‘seeing
the moon’.
  3 According to Laycock (1965: 165), only Yelogu has k2 for ‘eat’ and r@ for ‘drink’ (there are no forms for these in
the SIL survey lists, so I was not able to check this).
556      21 Issues in Semantics and Features of Lexicon  Unlike in, say, Indo-European languages such as English (also see an overview in Evans and
Wilkins 2000), ‘see’ does not cover the meanings of ‘know’ or ‘understand’ (these are expressed
with laku- ‘know, understand’, and partly with wuk@- —see below).
  In its meaning ‘try’, v@- typically describes trying something by taste or touch. The manner
of ‘trying’ is speciﬁed with a sequencing -n form of a verb, as in 21.8:
21.8 ka:n      v@-tua
     eat+seq see/try-1sgsubj.vt+3fem.sgbas.vt
     ‘I am trying (the new food) by eating’
   An imperative of v@-, ap, can mean ‘look!’ or ‘try!’ As is typical for imperatives, it has to have
a telic and volitional meaning—that is, ap does not mean ∗ ‘see!’ or ∗ ‘experience!’ However, a
permissive form remains polysemous—21.9 has both meanings ‘may I see/may I look’ and ‘may
I try’. It does not mean ‘may I experience’, because ‘experiencing’ denoted by v@- is beyond
asking for permission—this is something that just happens no matter what.
21.9 vau
     see/try+1sgimpv
     ‘May I see/look’; ‘may I try?’
  To avoid the ambiguity, one can use a verb compounding construction involving the bound
root -k@ta ‘try’ (discussed under A3 in §15.3.1; see 15.40). Forms with the bound root -k@ta
have no imperative.
21.10a [k@-k@ta-n] [vau]
       eat-try-seq see/try+1sgimpv
       ‘May I try and eat’ (lit. try by eating)
       ∗
         May I see and eat
  Yet another alternative is a biclausal construction with a sequencing -n:
21.10b [ka:n] [vau]
       eat+seq see/try+1sgimpv
       ‘May I try by eating’
       ∗
         May I see and eat
 If the verb v@- is used in such a biclausal construction and is marked with -n, the resulting
meaning is ‘try and see, try and look’, and not ∗ ‘see looking’:
21.11 [væn]        [ap]
      see/try+seq impv+see/try
      ‘Try and see, try and look’
  If the verb v@- appears with a completive medial clause as its clausal complement in O
function (see §19.8), it can only mean ‘see’, as in T2.4, T3.20, T3.48, and 21.12.
21.12 [waku-d@-k]                   [v@-l@-d]
      go.out-3masc.sg-compl.ds see-3fem.sgsubj.p-3masc.sgbas.p
      ‘She saw that he went out’
      ∗
        She tried for him to go out
   We saw in §16.1.1 that the form -k@ta- takes the directional markers to provide directional
speciﬁcations for v@- ‘see/look’. Since directionals make the verb telic (see §16.1.3), the transla-
tion ‘look’, and not ‘see’, is the only one appropriate for v@- with a directional (see 14.95, 16.7,
                                                                    21.1 Verb semantics           55716.55, and 19.89). The directional forms of verbs of perception, ‘see/look’ and ‘hear/listen’,
indicate the direction of the gaze or listening. The directional suppletive forms of ‘look’ are
used adverbially, as modiﬁers, but never as verb roots. This is how ‘look’ diﬀers from all other
intrinsically directional verbs (see Table 16.2). If used with a directional, the verb v@- cannot
mean ‘try’, e.g. k@tu v@- (look.up see/look-) can only mean ‘look upwards’, and not ∗ ‘try and
look upwards’.
   A recent extension of the verb v@- is ‘read’. The accusative-locative often marks the object of
‘see’ in this meaning, but does not have to (see §7.3):
21.13a a     l@-a:b   buk ma: v@,           d@-k@-d@ka v@-d@-l
       then she-too book neg see+neg he-obl-only see-3masc.sgsubj.p-3fem.sgbas.p
       ‘She did not read the book, only he read it’
21.13b buka:m                v@-na
       book+lk+acc/loc see-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt
       ‘She is reading a (speciﬁc) book’
  We can also recall, from §17.4, that a formally unmarked body part m@l ‘eye’ can be used in
a body part construction with the verb v@-. Its eﬀect is to stress the perceptual meaning ‘see;
look’, as in 17.65 and 21.14. In 17.65 a child is instructed to look properly at what she is doing,
and in 21.14 the speaker was recounting her own experience:
21.14 k@tab@k-a                  ja:p m@l v@-tua
      this.way+pred+like-lk thing eye see-1sgsubj.vt+3fem.sgbas.vt
      ‘I saw this kind of thing with my (own) eye’
We saw in §7.3 that occasionally m@l ‘eye’ can take accusative-locative case if seeing with
‘one’s own eyes’ is focused, as in k@p-a m@la:m v@-k-na-ñ@n (own-lk eye+lk+loc see-fut-
act.foc-2fem.sgbas.vt) ‘you will see (the Swakap people and their ways) with your own eyes
(as opposed to hearing about them)’. (No such examples have been attested for ‘ear’ with
‘hear’—see below.)
  It was seen in §4.5 that the form kuk@- ‘back’ appears in a few modiﬁer-noun compounds,
including a partially predictable one kuk@-m@l, in kuk@-m@l v@- (back-eye see) meaning ‘look
back’ (see §4.5.2). If repeated, it can be used ironically to describe someone looking over and
admiring themselves, as in 21.15. This is how Kerryanne was supposed to react to a traditional
Papua New Guinea style female dress ‘meriblaus’ which I was instructed to buy for her:
21.15 kuk@-m@l kuk@-m@l v@-k-na
      back-eye back-eye see/look-fut-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt
      ‘She will look at herself admiringly’ (lit. eye to the back eye to the back she will see)
  The body part does not aﬀect the verb’s transitivity: the object can be understood from the
context, as in 21.15, or it can be overtly stated, as in 21.16:
21.16 k@p m@l v@-tua-d                          kara:b
      just eye see-1sgsubj.vt-3masc.sgbas.p men’s.house
      ‘It is that I saw the man’s house with my (own) eyes’
  The verb v@- appears in a number of formations which marginally involve vision as a
means of perception, e.g. v@-s@m@l- (see-?-) ‘look for’, v@-s@m@l-s@m@l- ‘look for something very
carefully’ (see §15.3.1), v@-k@ka-n t@- (see-?-seq have-) ‘look after’ (15.27), and v@-v@-ka- (see-
see-‘move’?-) in v@-v@-ka-taka- (see-see-?-put-) ‘watch carefully’ (15.28). An additional irregular
558     21 Issues in Semantics and Features of Lexiconform v@-v@-ka- means ‘see, watch’ in the following lexicalized complex predicate. A synonymous
expression is given in 20.17b:
21.17a m@l v@-v@-kan         kwa-na
       eye see-red-?+seq stay-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt
       ‘She is watching (us talking) (not doing anything else)’
21.17b m@l væn       kwa-na
       eye see+seq stay-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt
       ‘She is watching (us talking) (not doing anything else)’
   In none of these cases can the verb v@- accompanied by m@l have the meaning of ‘try’ or
‘experience’. In just one instance does v@- combine with a directional form of the verb kar-/kra-
‘carry, bring’: v@-kraki- (see-carry.across-) means ‘recognize by seeing’. It also combines with
-sapwi- ‘open’, meaning v@-sapwi- (see-open-) ‘discover by seeing something’ (see below on
wuk@-sapwi- ‘discover by hearing’).","[582, 583, 584, 585]"
"                              10.6.2 Numerals higher than tenTable 10.9 features numerals from eleven to twenty, with translations and a gloss. We have seen
that numerals from one to ten are uniform for all speakers. The larger the numeral, the more
variability there is. The third column of Table 10.9 features numbers from eleven to twenty
produced by several 8- to 9-year-olds. The forms diﬀerent from those used by traditional
speakers are in bold.
   For ten and twenty, there are special counting terms for money (traditionally used for shell
valuables): mi nak (literally, stick one) or j @l@g nak (literally, string one) ‘ten (valuables)’, and
mi-v@ti or j @l@g v@ti ‘twenty valuables’.
   All numerals higher than ten are noun phrases. Numerals from eleven to fourteen consist of
‘ten’ followed by the word mæn ‘leg’, and then a numeral one to four: tab@ti mæn nak ‘eleven’
(lit. both hands one on one leg?), tab@ti mæn v@ti ‘twelve’, tab@ti man mugul ‘thirteen’, and
tab@ti man ali ‘fourteen’. ‘Fifteen’ is formed with ‘ten’ and the form man followed by -@b ‘all?’
(this could be the same morpheme as in tab-ab ‘ﬁve’), tab@ti man@b (literally, two hands (and)
all the leg).
   Numbers from sixteen to nineteen are formed on ﬁfteen, followed by n@mn@m (not used
anywhere else in the language), and then followed by numbers one to four, e.g. tab@ti man@b
n@mn@m nak ‘sixteen’.
   Young speakers regularize the system, by forming all numbers from eleven to nineteen in the
same way (and avoiding the rare form n@mn@m). The term for ‘twenty’, du-a-mi nak (man-lk-
tree one), refers to the number of ﬁngers and toes on one person. This is reminiscent of the form
for ‘twenty’ in Boiken, du mi nap2 (man stick one), which also involves mi, and also Iatmul kita

du-mi (one man-?stick). (In other Ndu languages, such as Gala, the term for ‘twenty’ is ‘one
person’: lua-nok.)
   Table 10.10 features numbers from twenty-one onwards. Numbers from twenty-one to
twenty-nine are given in full. They consistently involve du-a-mi ‘twenty’, a connector sa:p (not
found anywhere in the language except for complex numerals), and then a lower number from
one to nine.
   Numbers for the multiples of ten have alternative forms. The forms in the ﬁrst column
are the ones accepted by a majority of knowledgeable male speakers. These are twenty-based
and involve (formally unmarked) multiplication, and addition marked with either sa:p or with
n@mn@m. So, the term for thirty is ‘twenty plus ten’; forty is ‘two twenties’; ﬁfty is ‘two-twenty
plus ten’; sixty is ‘three twenties’; seventy is ‘three twenties plus ten’; eighty is ‘four twenties’;
ninety is ‘four twenties plus ten’; and one hundred is ‘ﬁve twenties’. The connector for twenties
is sa:p, and n@mn@m is a connector for units (one to nine).
   Such a twenty-based system is found in the dialect of Iatmul described by Staalsen (n.d.b),
e.g. dumi kuvuk (twenty three) ‘sixty’. Similar forms appear in the dialect of Korogo (Jen-
draschek, p.c.), e.g. ndumi kuvuk ‘sixty’, du-mi taba nak (man-? hand one = ﬁve). The numbers
in Gala also partially operate on the same, vigesimal, basis, e.g. lua-nok waja-ﬁt (man-one =
twenty ten (=hand-two)’) ‘thirty’.
   Speakers are fairly consistent in the forms for numbers up until twenty-nine. From thirty
onwards, there is a certain amount of confusion which cuts across dialectal boundaries.
The numbers in Table 10.10 appear to be the most accepted ones (this system was partially
described by Farnsworth and Farnsworth n.d.).
   Some speakers use du-a-mi mugul (twenty (man-lk-tree three) ) for ‘thirty’. This parallels
Iatmul ndu-mi kuvuk (man-? three) (note that in Iatmul the term for twenty is du-mi kita (man-?

is duami abun (twenty six); seventy is duami ab@ti (twenty seven), eighty is duami abumugul
(twenty eight), and ninety is duami aba:li (twenty nine). Each of these forms has a parallel in
Iatmul of Korogo where doublet forms were also attested, e.g. du-mi ainak (man-? four) and
du-mi viti (man-? two) ‘forty’, du-mi sila kita (man-? ? six) and du-mi kuvuk (man-? three) ‘sixty’,
and so on.
   The alternative term for ‘hundred’ in Manambu is duamir duamir tab@ti (twenty+instr
twenty+instr ten), which is somewhat similar but not fully parallel to Iatmul du-mi taba vli
(man-? hand two=ten) (Jendraschek, p.c.).
   Another alternative form for forty was duamir duamir a:li (twenty+instr twenty+instr
four). This was discarded as an error by most speakers who said that this means ‘row of
twenties’. Another alternative is duamir viti (twenty+instr two) ‘forty’. In 10.149 below, duami
viti and duamir viti were used interchangeably. Occasionally, a forty-based system was attested,
as in duamir n@ sa:p tab@ti mæn nak (twenty+instr one and ten leg one) ‘ﬁfty-one’ (lit. one
forty and eleven). This was used by just one speaker (who had used duami viti and then duamir
viti for ‘forty’ in the previous sentence, in 10.149). Since the term in Tok Pisin almost always
accompanies such lengthy numbers, there are hardly ever any misunderstandings.
   The following forms have been cited for numbers over 100:  duami tab@ti (twenty ten) ‘200’,
  duami tab@ti mana:b (twenty ten leg+too) ‘300’,
  duamir duamir duami nak (twenty+instr twenty+instr twenty one) ‘400’,
  duamir duamir duami nak mana:b (twenty+instr twenty+instr twenty one leg+too) ‘500’,
  duamir duamir duami nak mana:b n@mn@m nak ‘600’;
  duamir duamir duami nak mana:b n@mn@m viti ‘700’;
242     10 Closed Classes  duamir duamir duami nak mana:b n@mn@m mugul ‘800’;
  duamir duamir duami nak mana:b n@mn@m a:li ‘900’, and
  duamir duamir duami nak mana:b n@mn@m taba:b ‘1000’.
  Numbers over 100 are hardly ever used.
  The Manambu people are ‘number-proud’. Knowledge of high numbers is considered a
valuable token of expertise in the language. At present, Tok Pisin numbers (which are easier
to handle and to remember) are used in everyday life, especially those from eleven onwards.
Higher numbers occur in traditional stories, or when a speaker wishes to display their expertise,
especially if the context involves traditional counting contexts. These include counting one’s
ancestors, counting the number of enemies killed in battle, and counting shell valuables. In
10.148, from the story about how the Vali:k clan was founded (similar to Text 2), high numbers
are used to compare the prowess of the two men.
10.148 yi-da-k           S@sawi paki      duami mugul sa:p tamb@ti

       kill-3masc.sgsubj.p-3plbas.p man number+lk-count then say-3dubas.p
       ‘Having gone (to ﬁght), number of people killed by S@sawi is 70, number of people
       killed by Kamkudi is 89, this is how they counted’
  High numbers, whenever they are used, are likely to be accompanied by translations into
Tok Pisin, since the speakers are never conﬁdent that their audience really understands these.
In 10.149, the speaker made sure he translated the numbers; however, he himself used two
diﬀerent forms for ‘forty’:
10.149 duami viti vya-da-di                  vya-ku        wali kudir
       twenty two hit-3plsubj.p-3plbas.p hit-compl.ss white language+instr

       ‘They killed forty (people), having killed them; in white language (Tok Pisin) we say
       about them, they are forty, in the village language we (say) “forty” ’
   Numbers higher than ten are postposed to the head noun, or occur in split noun phrases (as
in 10.148), or without a head noun, as in 10.149. Manambu has a word for number, paki; the
verb for counting nas- can also mean ‘enumerate’, or ‘list’ (as in 10.68). A full account and an
attempt to reconstruct the Proto-Ndu numbers is in Aikhenvald (forthcoming b).

modiﬁers, (iii) whether they can take case marking; and (iv) whether they allow overt marking
of number and gender. These are partly summarized in Table 10.11.
   Further grammatical subclasses can be established within each particular class. We saw
above that reactivated topic demonstratives behave diﬀerently from any other demonstratives
(or any other classes in the language) in that they take a predicative marker -n followed by
a-gender-number-ka when focused or when used as predicate heads. Current relevance demon-
stratives have no gender and number marking, in contrast to spatio-temporal demonstratives
which do.
        11        Predicate Structure and Verb Root Types
Verbs are the most complicated part of the Manambu grammar, both in terms of the wealth
of their categories, and of the array of root alternations (see §4.2.1). In §11.1, I discuss verbal
categories and verb structure. The structure of non-verbal predicates is addressed in §11.2. An
overview of verbal root types in terms of their alternations is in §11.3.                 11.1 v e r ba l c at e g o r i e s a n d v e r b s t ru c t u r e                          11.1.1 Inﬂected and uninﬂected verbsEach verb can occur in one of two types of form:
  r inflected—those which take personal cross-referencing, and
  r uninflected—those which do not take any personal cross-referencing (though they may
    take other aﬃxes).","[266, 267, 268, 269, 270, 271]"

       ‘After he too had drunk water, then they two went. As a result they went and arrived in
       the village’ (lit. going going out in the village)
  Manambu does not have a morphological resultative derivation—desubordinated medial
sequencing clauses play the part of ‘resultative’ strategies.
  Medial completive clauses, typically same-subject ones, can be used on their own, with a
completive meaning. A speaker came into the house and showed us a ﬁsh, commenting on
how she had obtained it:
19.112 [sa:n yapi-ku]
       money buy/pay-compl.ss
       ‘I have paid money (for it)’ (lit. having paid money (for it)
  This completive use is semantically close to the meaning of the anterior complex predicate
with the auxiliary t@- discussed at §17.1.1. Yet, it is diﬀerent inasmuch as the focus is on the
completion of the action and the result achieved.
  Desubordination has its roots in ellipsis. Yet the two are diﬀerent. Consider 19.113b, an
answer to the question in 19.113a:
19.113a ak@         s@k@r væra-k-ñ@na
        what.fem.sg time come.back-fut-2fem.sgsubj.vt+3fem.sgsubj.vt
        ‘What time will you come back?’
19.113b [na:gw yapi-ku]
        sago buy-compl.ss
        ‘After I had bought sago’ (lit. having bought sago)
  This has a clear overtone of sequencing and of relative tense: ‘I will come back after I’ve
bought sago’. Not so with 19.112 which simply focuses on the completion of an action. (An
additional way of focusing on the completion of one action before the start of another is
through using ya:kya ‘OK’ or its Tok Pisin equivalent orait in lieu of a main clause. We return
to this in §20.4.2.)
  Along similar lines, a cotemporaneous clause can be used on its own, to express prolonged
action that started before the moment of speech and goes on and on. An example is at
19.114—a mother was exhausted by her baby daughter’s drinking and peeing non-stop. Similar
examples are at 4.33 and 18.35.
19.114 [gu     k@-ta:y]           [wus yi-ta:y]
       water consume-cotemp pee go-cotemp
       ‘All she does is drink and pee’ (lit. having drunk water having peed)
  Desubordinated cotemporaneous clauses typically occur in pairs, as in 19.114, 4.33, and
18.35, referring to continuous alternate or simultaneous actions. Since Manambu does not
have a dedicated verbal form to cover this meaning, once again a desubordinated verb can be
said to ﬁll in a gap.
  Desubordination of the three dependent clause types discussed here goes hand in hand with
grammaticalizing the most frequent desubordinated forms into connectives. We saw in §18.3
that the form t@-ku (stand-compl.ss) operates almost like a conjunction ‘thus, and so’ (18.28).
506     19 Other Dependent ClausesThis form is indeed in the process of grammaticalization as part of a complex connective:
al@k t@-ku (dem.dist.fem.sg+dat stand-compl.ss) is used as a clause linker meaning ‘and so,
as a result’ (§19.6 and 19.78). Fixed combinations [ak@m t@-ku] (where+loc stay-compl.ss)
or [ak@b t@-ku] (where+term stay-compl.ss) meaning ‘where from?’ (as in 7.29 and 7.55) are
frequently used as an interrogative on their own: we can recall, from §10.4, that Manambu does
not have a dedicated interrogative form meaning ‘where from’ (there is one meaning ‘where to’,
and another one meaning ‘where (location)’). A desubordinated verb is again used to ﬁll a gap:
ak@m t@-ku can be considered a new interrogative form. Desubordinated sequencing forms
containing -n are on the way towards being reinterpreted as adverbs; see 18.7–8 in §18.2 (also
see §4.4). Unlike corresponding verbal forms, they cannot be negated separately.
   We can recall, from 18.8, that s@b@n@-n (return-seq) can be used as a verbal modiﬁer meaning
‘back’, and can also be used as a medial verb ‘returning’. The two usages can be distinguished:
the verb in a dependent clause can have its own arguments and obliques and can be negated,
and the verbal modiﬁer cannot.
   The dependent clause verb s@b@n-@n in its negative and positive form is illustrated in 19.115.
The relevant forms are underlined.
19.115 [l@ wiya:r            s@b@n-@n] [ñan-ugw-a:k        kamna:gw
       she house+lk+all return-seq child-pl-lk+dat food
       kui-k-la]                   [s@b@n-ma:r-@n]      kui                 ma:
       give.to.3p-fut-3fem.sgsubj return-neg.dep-seq give.to.third.pneg neg
       ‘On returning to the house (or: by returning to the house) she will give children food,
       on not returning (or: by not returning) she won’t give (it to them)’
The same form s@b@n@n reanalysed as a verbal modiﬁer in 18.8 cannot be negated, since
negation is a clausal category in Manambu, and a verbal modiﬁer cannot be negated.
  A cotemporaneous form of wa- ‘say’ in the form ata-wa-ta:y (then-say-cotemp) has devel-
oped into a connective ‘and so then, in summary, this is why’—see §19.6 (especially example
19.80). And the verb yi- with a sequencing medial clause marker -n is often employed as a
marker of continuing action, as in 18.9 and 19.116.
19.116 [kwasa-kwasa-di sa:s           yin]    [numa-di kuyak t@-na-di]
       small-small-pl     boil/bubble go+seq big-pl    wound be/stand-act.foc-3plbas.vt
       ‘Tiny tiny boils gradually become big wounds’
   In 19.116, little boils or bubble-like spots on the skin do not go anywhere: as they develop
on and on, they grow into big wounds. It is this process of gradually and continually changing
state that is captured by yi:n ‘going’.
   In summary: desubordination of dependent clauses and subsequent grammaticalization of
the most frequently used desubordinated forms is an ongoing process in Manambu.
        20        Clause Types and Discourse-Pragmatic Devices
We now turn to further issues in Manambu syntax, starting with a discussion of the structure
of major constituents and order of words within them. We then summarize the properties of
clause types and criteria for determining core grammatical relations (§20.1). We then discuss the
pragmatic motivations behind the ordering of constituents within clauses (§20.2). Highlighting
focus constructions are discussed in §20.3. The devices used for linking sentences in discourse,
including turn taking, and marking of topicality, are addressed in §20.4. There we also deal
with the principles of ellipsis—a prominent feature of Manambu discourse.                 20.1 m a j o r c o n s t i t u e n t s, c laus e ty p e s, and
                              grammatical relat ions                          20.1.1 The structure of noun phrasesA noun phrase in Manambu is composed of a head—usually, a noun—and one or more
modiﬁers. If the noun head is omitted, a modiﬁer can be used in headless noun phrases. Closed
classes diﬀer in terms of whether they can occur as NP heads—this is summarized in Table
10.11 in §10.7. If a noun phrase is headed by a pronoun, no further modiﬁers can be used.
   Inﬂected verbs within relative clauses, nouns, adjectives, and a number of closed classes
(personal pronouns, indeﬁnite pronoun n@k@- ‘other, another’, quantiﬁers, and numbers) can
all be modiﬁers in a noun phrase. We recall (§4.1.1) that prehead modiﬁers take a linker which
is only partially predictable. The most frequent order of modiﬁers in a noun phrase is in
Scheme 20.1.
   As shown in §10.2.1, a spatio-temporal demonstrative and a ‘current relevance’ demon-
strative can occur together in one NP, as in 10.40–1. The current relevance demonstrative
with no gender or number speciﬁcation occurs ﬁrst and the spatio-temporal one follows,
providing further speciﬁcation. The two complement each other, since the ‘current relevance’
demonstrative does not convey information about the gender of the noun or its additional
distance from either the speaker or the addressee. And a spatio-temporal demonstrative can
provide supplementary directional speciﬁcation.
   Consider 20.1. Combining two demonstratives in one noun phrase allows the speaker to be
speciﬁc about the location of the village which is both upstream and inland, that is, away from
the river from where he is. The location ‘away from the river’ is expressed with a demonstrative
which follows the one stating the location ‘upstream’:20.1 k@-na-wur                 k@-d@-wul                   t@p-ad
     dem.prox-curr.rel-up dem.prox-masc.sg-inland village-3masc.sgnom
     ‘It is this-previously mentioned village upstream, this-away from the river big village’  That the village is big is clear from the masculine gender assignment (§5.2.1).

                           17.2.2 Support verbs with loan verbsLoan verbs often head a predicate as part of complex predicates with t@- ‘have, be, stand’ as a
support verb, as shown in 17.26a–b. This is the only instance when the support verb cannot be
omitted from the main clause.
17.26a aw 1963 transferred t@-dian              k@ka                   East Sepik
       then 1963 transferred stand-1plbas.vt dem.prox.react.top.fem.sg East.Sepik
       ‘Then in 1963 we were transferred here to East Sepik’
17.26b understand ada

       ‘Understand, you!’
  The support verb strategy is the only one available for loan verbs whose syllable structure is
more complex than (C)CVCV, as in 17.26a–b. Verbs of (C)CVCV structure can be borrowed
as inﬂected verbs, as in 17.27a, or as components in support verb complex predicates, as in
17.27b–c. The two strategies appear to be in free variation, as shown in 17.27a and 17.27b (by
the same speaker). Traditional speakers have a slight preference towards using loan verbs in
support verb constructions.

       resign have-compl.ss village+lk+all then go-1fem.sgbas.p
       ‘Having resigned I went to the village’         17.2.3 Support verbs with nominals, onomatopoeia, and expressivesThe polyfunctional verb t@- is also used as a support verb with nominals, e.g. kaig@n t@- ‘be
quiet’, warsam t@- ‘be angry’, kwa:m t@- ‘be crazy’, bapi t@- ‘be soft, spongy, drenched’. The
verb t@- is the semantically neutral choice: it does not involve any connotation of ‘standing’.
The two other positional verbs, r@- ‘sit’ and kwa- ‘stay’, can also be used with these nominals.
They then impart aspectual and positional overtones to the construction: kaig@n r@- means ‘be
quiet for some time, with an implication of sitting position of the subject’, and kaig@n kwa-
means ‘be quiet for quite a long time’. Further examples are at 17.39–41.
   Nouns marked with dative case take t@- as support verb, e.g. man@-k (leg/foot+lk-dat) t@-
‘have something wrong with one’s foot or leg’, yala:k (belly+lk+dat) t@- ‘have something
wrong with one’s belly’, or ab-a:k t@- (head-lk+dat be/stand/have) means ‘be not quite
right in one’s head’. The noun ba:r ‘fever’ occurs in a similar construction with kwa- ‘stay’
as support verb: bar@k kwa- (fever+lk+dat stay) ‘have fever, malaria’. As a joke, other
nouns can be used in this construction: an annoyingly talkative woman was once referred
to as maj@k t@-na ta:kw (speech+dat have-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt woman), ‘a woman who
has something wrong with her talking’. The only exceptions are expressions with the noun
kam@k (hunger+lk+dat) ‘for hunger’ which can be used with all three verbs: kam@k t@- ‘be
hungry’, kam@k r@- ‘be hungry (for some time)’, kam@k kwa- ‘be hungry for a very long
time’.
   The polyfunctional verb r@- ‘sit’ can take the adjective yara ‘well’ as its copula complement,
e.g. yara r@-na-wun ‘I am ﬁne’; as well as a number of nouns marked with the locative case,
e.g. stua-m r@- (store-loc sit) ‘be for sale in a store’, m@wula:m r@- (mind/inside+lk+loc sit-)
‘stay in one’s memory’, and the uninﬂected lotu ‘church’: lotu r@- ‘go to a church’. It also forms
idiomatic collocations, e.g. du-a-k r@- (man-lk-dat sit) ‘get married (of a woman)’, and mak@n
r@- (mourning sit) ‘be in mourning’ (illustrated in 4.19: the sign of mourning is a black string
worn around one’s neck, wrists, and ankles; ‘pan in mourning’ was a nickname given to a pan
with a black string tied to it).
   The polyfunctional verb na- is used as a support verb with nominals referring to physical
states, natural phenomena, ideophones, and expressives, as shown in 4.24, 4.81, 17.20 (in curly
brackets), and 17.29–32.17.29 gur-a-di wa:r         pa:m na-na-di

      ‘After it had dawned, they went oﬀ’
  Onomatopoeia—that is, a replication of an actual sound made by a living thing or an
object—with na- as support verb are illustrated in 17.32–3. A reactivated topic demonstrative
can intervene between the non-verbal component of a complex predicate and the support verb:
17.32 [kian kian kian kian kian na-ku]          yi-tua
      noise.a.hawk.makes        be:nat-compl.ss go-1sgsubj.vt+3fem.sgbas.vt
      ‘Having sounded kian-kian-kian-kian-kian, I go oﬀ’ (said the hawk)
17.33 kr@jan            aka                     na-na
      crackling.noise dem.dist.react.top.fem.sg be:nat-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt
      ‘It (shell) made a crackling noise’
  Expressives are similar to onomatopoeia in that they appear to iconically reﬂect a natural
phenomenon, without, however, replicating it. They are typically repeated from three to ﬁve
times. In 17.34 an expressive refers to a very dark cloud.
17.34 [g@l ata v@-d@-k]                     [ata war@-n       s@k       s@k

      see-3masc.sgsubj.p-3fem.sgbas.p dem.dist.react.top.fem.sg
      ‘He had then seen the dark (cloud), as it came, as it became black-black-black-black, he
      then looked at it (the village)’
In T2.25, the expressive s@r describes a very white colour of a man’s teeth glowing in the
dark (as the man was hiding standing in a sago trunk). Neither s@r ‘expressive:white’ nor sik
‘expressive:black’ are used in any other function. In 17.35, an expressive used with a support
verb na- refers to ﬁre bursting higher and higher:
17.35 yi jig@r         jig@r       jig@r   na-na
      ﬁre expr:go.up expr:go.up expr:go.up be:nat-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt
      ‘The ﬁre is going up and up and up’
  We recall, from §12.8.3, that a verbal root can be repeated to express particularly intensive
action, or state, as in 12.82, and T2.25 (third line: ‘eyes bulging out’). Such expressives also
take na- as a support verb.
  A complex predicate with na- as a support verb cannot form an imperative. To be used in a
command, it has to occur with an additional support verb t@- or r@-. This is the only instance
of two support verbs occurring in one complex predicate. The non-imperative equivalent of
17.36a is 17.36b.
17.36a {k@rk@m na-n}        ada
       be.silent be:nat-seq sit/stand.impv
       ‘Keep silent!’
17.36b {k@rk@m na-n}         r@-di
       be.silent be:nat-seq sit-3plbas.vt/p
       ‘They kept being silent (in a sitting position)’
434      17 Complex Predicates   As we recall, the verbs r@- and t@- share a suppletive imperative ada. Example 17.36c is
also a possible non-imperative version of 17.36a. The diﬀerence in meaning between 17.36b
and 17.36c is congruent with the diﬀerence between aspectual complex predicates involving r@-
and t@-.17.36c k@rk@m na-n          t@-di
       be.silent be:nat-seq sit-3plbas.vt/p
       ‘They have been silent’  The support verb na- can be omitted in main clauses, just like any support verb. There is
evidence that native speakers conceptualize the combination of the nominal component and
the support verb na- as one unit. Consider the following conversation. Five-year-old Kerryanne
was not sure how to say ‘hot’ in Manambu, and so she asked her mother in Tok Pisin with one
Manambu insert, t@p-a-kudi (village-lk-language) ‘village language’:17.37a Mama, hotpela long t@pakudi em i olsem wanem?
       ‘Mama, how is “hot” in the village language?’  Mali’s reply included not just the lexical item itself, but also the support verb:17.37b bwiyabwi na-na
       hot         be:nat-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt
       ‘It is hot’   A nominal requiring t@- as support verb would be typically given without a support verb,
e.g. m@k@m@k ‘be silent’. Further evidence comes from child language acquisition. At the age
of 3 Kerryanne had a tendency to overuse t@- in lieu of other support verbs (much to the
annoyance of her elder sister Tanina). For instance, she would say bæy t@-na (taste stand:sup.vb-
act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt), instead of bæy yi-na (taste ‘go’:sup.vb-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt) ‘It is
tasty’. (At the age of 5 she did not do this any more.)
   This, and the fact that the verb t@- appears as a support verb in a wider variety of contexts
than na-, indicates that t@- could be considered a functionally unmarked choice of support
verb. This is consistent with its use as the least functionally marked copula, ‘be’, ‘have’, or
‘become’ (see 4.16–17; further discussion of copula clauses is in §20.1.3). In neither of these
copula contexts is t@- straightforwardly associated with the meaning of ‘stand’ which it has as
a positional verb.
   Other polyfunctional verbs can occur as support verbs for selected nominals, but not for any
verbal forms. These involve yi- ‘say, go’, as in bæy yi- ‘be tasty’, kag@l yi- ‘be painful’, væt yi- ‘be
heavy’, karkwas yi- ‘squabble’, b@k@s yi- ‘quarrel’, kakelka:u yi- ‘be in a competition’, kwas@k
yi- ‘be unwilling’ (see 4.22), and ka:b yi- ‘be greedy, not giving’, illustrated in 4.38.
   The verb yi- can be used instead of t@- as a support verb for loans denoting the process of
acquiring a state, as in 17.38.17.38 les yi-na-wun-@k                          gu    k@ka:k
      lazy ‘go’-act.foc-1fem.sgbas.vt-conf water consume+red+purp
      ‘I am getting too lazy (unwilling) to drink water’   The verb kur- ‘do, get’ occurs as a support verb in a few instances, e.g. karkwas kur-
‘squabble’, luku kur- ‘steal’. At least some of these instances can be alternatively analysed as
lexicalized complex predicates—see §17.3.
                                     17.2 Complex predicates containing support verbs         435                  17.2.4 How to choose a support verb for a nominalThe semantic principles behind the assignment of a support verb to particular nominals are not
always straightforward. While ideophones, expressives, and descriptions of natural phenomena
almost exclusively warrant na-, for many nominals referring to physical states the choice
appears to be arbitrary, and the support verb has to be remembered. The nominal wiyaw
‘light and dry’ requires the support verb na-; and the nominal væt ‘heavy’ goes with yi-. The
nominal k@rk@m ‘silent’ requires na-, and its near synonym m@k@m@k requires t@-, as shown
in 17.40.
   Alternatively, m@k@m@k (but not k@rk@m) can occur in an aspectual complex verb contain-
ing either r@- or kwa- —see 17.39 and 14.117. Both 17.39 and 17.40 have distinct positional
overtones.
17.39 ma:j ma: w@,           m@k@m@k ra:d
      speech neg say+neg silent         sit+3masc.sgbas.vt/p
      ‘He did not say anything, he kept silent (in sitting position)’
17.40 ta:b ku-sada-taka-ku            m@k@m@k ta:d
      hand put-inside-put-compl.ss silent        stand+3masc.sgbas.vt/p
      ‘Having put his hand (inside a pocket) he stood very still’
  Two support verbs can sometimes be interchangeable: karkwas yi- and karkwas kur- ‘squab-
ble’ are a case in point. Not so for the nominal kaig@n ‘quiet’ which requires the support verb
t@-, r@-, or kwa- depending on the subject’s position and the aspectual value of the clause, as in
17.41a–c.
17.41a kaig@n aka                           t@-na
       quiet dem.dist.react.top.fem.sg stand-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt
       ‘She is quiet’ (position unspeciﬁed)
17.41b kaig@n aka                       r@-na
       quiet dem.dist.react.top.fem.sg sit-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt
       ‘She is keeping quiet (sitting)’
17.41c kaig@n aka                         kwa-na
       quiet dem.dist.react.top.fem.sg stay-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt
       ‘She is staying quiet’ (long time)
If used in the same clause as yi-, kaig@n can only be interpreted as a modiﬁer to yi- in its
meaning ‘go’ as a main verb—see 17.42.
17.42 kaig@n aka                      yi-na
      quiet dem.dist.react.top.fem.sg go-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt
      ‘She is going quietly’
      ∗
        ‘She is quiet’
  The nominal component of a complex predicate can be questioned, with at@ta ‘how?’ (see
§10.4), as illustrated in 17.43a–b.
17.43a ab-a               kag@l yi-na
       head-3fem.sgnom pain ‘go’:sup.vb-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt
       ‘(My) head aches’ (lit. is achy)
436      17 Complex Predicates17.43b ab-a                at@ta yi-na?
       head-3fem.sgnom how ‘go’:sup.vb-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt
       ‘Head is what?’ (lit. Head is how?), i.e. ‘What’s the matter with your head?’   This is unlike complex predicates of other kinds, where the non-auxiliary component cannot
be questioned. We can recall, from §4.2.2, that copula clauses are structurally similar to
support verb constructions; moreover, the copula complement shares features with the nominal
component of support verb constructions. The ability of being questioned is one such feature.
   An additional complication comes into play. Polyfunctional verbs which form aspectual
and modal complex verbs and occur as support verbs also appear in what can be considered
lexicalized complex predicates. This is the topic of our next section.
                       17.3 l e x i c a l i z e d c o m p l e x p r e d i c at e sAs we saw in the previous section, the choice of a support verb can be fairly unpredictable.
Many support verb constructions are lexicalized. Nominal components of lexicalized complex
predicates vary in their status: some are full nouns, and others have few nominal properties.
For instance, s@kul@k as in s@kul@k yi- (cook go/do) ‘do cooking, cook’ cannot head an NP in
any function other than purpose. Then it is marked with dative case, as in 17.44:17.44 ñ@n      adakw      al@dab                           s@kul@k-a:k
      you.fem stay:impv dem.dist+fem.sg+down+term cooking-lk+dat
      ‘You (feminine) stay right down there, for (the purpose of doing) the cooking’   Whether a nominal component in complex verbs is part of the verb’s argument structure
or not is a diﬃcult question. The meaning of complex verbs is idiomatic to a varying extent.
For instance, the verbs ji- and sakwi- are used only in complex verbs with s@p ‘skin’, meaning
‘be fed up’. The nominal component m@yakw is not used anywhere except with the verb kwa-
‘stay’; the resulting complex verb meyakw kwa- means ‘like’.
   Other complex verbs are semantically transparent. The noun gu ‘water’ in gu yaku- (water
wash) ‘bathe’ can be interpreted as the unmarked typical location for ‘washing oneself’; sua:l
‘lie, story’ can be interpreted as the object of taka- ‘put’, and kur- ‘do’, in expressions sua:l taka-
and sua:l kur- ‘to lie’. The verbs yaku- ‘wash’, taka- ‘put’, and kur- ‘do’ are transitive if used on
their own. Complex verbs ‘bathe’ and ‘lie’ are intransitive. That is, a nominal component of a
complex verb may aﬀect the transitivity of the whole.
   Numerous complex predicates consist of a nominal which usually cannot head a predicate
on its own, followed by a verb from a closed class. They share the following features:     (i) they form two independent phonological and grammatical words;
    (ii) their components tend to be contiguous, and only constituents such as ata ‘then’,
         reactivated topic demonstratives, and adverbs can intervene between them;
   (iii) the order of components can be reversed as a means of marking afterthought;
   (iv) the nominal component cannot be questioned;
    (v) the nominal component or the verb can be ellipsed if clear from the context;
   (vi) it is often the case that the nominal component is not used elsewhere in the language;
         and
  (vii) they are translated into Tok Pisin or English as one verb, and when code-switching
         takes place they are replaced with a one-word verb.
                                                      17.3 Lexicalized complex predicates          437Lexicalized compounds may include a polyfunctional verb, e.g. s@ kwa- (sleep lie) ‘sleep’ (12.5,
12.81), m@yakw kwa- (? stay) ‘like’; luku kur- (? do/get) ‘steal’ (7.4, 13.85), s@kul@k yi- (? go)
‘cook’ (12.10, 17.44). Or they may include another verb with a generic meaning, e.g. s@- ‘make,
plant’, as in ya:p s@ (breath plant) ‘breathe’, bas s@- (ﬁrst plant) or ga:m s@- (? plant) ‘shout,
serenade, sing’, or wa- ‘say, speak’, as in mikuli wa- (17.7), or taka- ‘put’ as in aban taka- (? put-)
‘agree, conspire’ and api: taka- (? put) ‘yawn’. Or both parts may not be used anywhere else in
the language, e.g. agur væ- ‘snore’.
   The nominal component may, or may not, be used in the language in other contexts. For
instance, m@yakw, luku, or s@kul@k, ga:m, and aban are not used anywhere other than in
complex predicates. In contrast, the form bas ‘ﬁrst’ appears as an adverb meaning ‘ﬁrst’, e.g.
bas yawi waku- (ﬁrst work go.out) ‘go out for work for the ﬁrst time’ or bas-a du (ﬁrst-lk
man) ‘ﬁrst/most important man’. The nouns ya:p ‘breath, asthma’ and s@ ‘sleep’ can be used
as ordinary common nouns.
   The components of lexicalized complex predicates tend to be contiguous, but this is not a
steadfast rule. In 12.81 the connective ata ‘then’ intervenes between components. In the last line
of 17.45, a repeated adverb yapw@r yapw@r ‘very quickly’ and the connective intervene between
the components of a lexicalized complex predicate. This is a means of focusing on the adverb:
the woman was told to cook quickly, and so quickly she cooked:
17.45 wa-d@-k                 yapw@r yapw@r s@kul@k ay,       s@kul@k ata
      say-3masc.sg-compl.ds quickly quickly cooking impv+‘go’ cooking then
      yapw@r yapw@r ya:l
      quickly quickly ‘go’+3fem.sgbas.p
      ‘After he had said: “Cook quickly”, quickly she cooked’
   In 14.122 two adverbs, both loans from Tok Pisin, intervene between the components of the
complex predicate luku kur- ‘steal’. The speaker was lamenting the fact that people steal food
from other people’s gardens more and more. The negator tends to be placed between the two
components, as in 17.46:
17.46 ya:p ma: s@
      breath neg plant+neg
      ‘(He) is not breathing’
   Alternatively, it can precede the whole predicate (as in the ﬁrst clause of 17.52), with no
noticeable semantic diﬀerence.
   The nominal component of a lexicalized complex predicate can be ellipsed if the predicate
is repeated, as in the following dialogue (a continuation of 17.45). In examples 17.47–50, Ø
indicates that the nominal component or the verb has been omitted.
17.47 [ata wa-d@-l],                         [ñ@n     s@kul@k a-y],

      ‘Then he said to her: “You cook!”, after he had said (this), “I will do (cooking)”, she
      then said’
  Along similar lines, in ‘head-tail’ linkage only the verb gets repeated, as in 17.48:
438     17 Complex Predicates17.48 [s@kul@k ata ya:l]                 [Ø ya:n    napa-l@-k]               [ata

      wa:d]
      say+3masc.sgbas.p
      ‘Then she did the cooking. After she had done (cooking), he said’
  Or the verb can be omitted, as in 17.49–50. Such ellipsis only occurs in highly colloquial
register, and only if the non-verbal component is frequent and not used anywhere else, as is the
case with luku ‘stealing’.
17.49 wun-a-di kaukau        b@       luku Ø, miyawa
      I-lk-pl sweet.potato already stealing all
      ‘My sweet potatoes (have been) stolen, all of them!’

      stealing-only stealing-only stealing-only
      ‘Stealing, stealing, stealing only’ (said about young people stealing sweet potatoes from
      gardens)
When used without the verb, luku may have a more general meaning, ‘cheating, being unfaith-
ful’, as in 15.52. The non-verbal component can be placed after the verb, as an afterthought—
as in 17.51:
17.51 pusi kur-kur@k, luku
      cat do-red+dat stealing
      ‘(I put the food into a basket hung on the ceiling) so that cats may not steal it (lit. may
      not take it, that is stealing)’
  This afterthought is here used to avoid potential ambiguity: without luku the hearer could
have thought that cats were going to get the food (we can recall that kur- also means ‘get’), and
not that they were going to steal it, or to get it stealthily.
  Complex verbs whose non-verbal components are not so frequent do not seem to allow
such ellipsis. For instance, the lexicalized complex predicate m@yakw kwa- ‘like’ is hardly ever
reduced to just m@yakw:
17.52 [ta:kw aba:b d@-k@-k       ma: m@yakw ku],            [al@k     ta:kw ma: k@r]
      woman too he-obl-dat neg liking            stay:neg this.is.why woman neg get+neg
      ‘Women too didn’t like him, this is why he didn’t get married’
  Some lexicalized complex predicates whose non-verbal component is also used as a noun can
occur with manner and quantity modiﬁers which contain either the same noun, as in 10.127a,
or a synonymous adverbial expression such as kwasa gwad@m meaning ‘fast asleep’ in 17.53.
17.53 kwasa gwad@m s@         kwa-na
      fast.asleep       sleep stay-act.foc+3fem.sg.bas.vt
      ‘She is fast asleep’
  These examples provide further evidence in favour of lexicalized complex predicates as
conceptual units with one, unitary meaning. This is corroborated by the ways in which they
get translated into Tok Pisin and English, and also how code-switching operates. The complex
predicate m@yakw kwa- (see 17.52) was replaced with Tok Pisin code-switch laiki- by a diﬀerent
speaker: so, m@yakw kwa-na-ñ@n (liking stay-act.foc-2fem.sgbas.vt) ‘you like (something or
to do something)’ was given as equivalent to laiki-na-ñ@n (like-act.foc-2fem.sgbas.vt).
                                     17.4 Body part constructions as complex predicates        439   The class of lexicalized compounds may be extended to include a variety of ﬁxed expressions
involving polyfunctional verbs and nouns or adjectives, e.g. yawi kur- (work do-) ‘work’;
sua:l kur- (lie do) and sua:l taka- (lie put) ‘lie’, m@wulam r@- (inside+loc sit) ‘stay in one’s
memory, be remembered’, yara r@- ‘live OK, be in place’, k@p kwa- (just stay) ‘be messing
about, doing nothing’, yara kwa- ‘be OK (or not)’. Some such ﬁxed expressions containing
positional verbs can be considered copula clauses with a somewhat unpredictable idiomatic
meaning (see §20.1.3). They diﬀer from lexicalized complex predicates, discussed at some length
in this section, in that their nominal component can be questioned. One can ask at@ta kwa-na?
(how stay-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt) ‘How is she?’ and receive an answer yara kwa-na ‘she is
ﬁne’, or k@p kwa-na ‘she is messing about, doing nothing’.
   Not so with m@wulam r@- (inside+loc sit) ‘stay in one’s memory, be remembered’. One can
say a ma:j m@wulam r@-na (dem.dist.fem.sg story inside+loc sit-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt) and
this means ‘I remember that story’, literally ‘that story sits in my inside’ (see §21.4 about mawul
‘inside’ as a location for human emotions and memory). But one cannot ask a question a ma:j
agwam r@-na? (dem.dist.fem.sg story what+lk+loc stay-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt) ‘where does
the story sit?’ and receive an answer ∗ m@wulam r@-na. An appropriate answer to such a question
would involve a concrete location, for instance, bukam r@-na ‘it is in the book/notebook’.
Similarly with dua:k r@- (man+lk+dat sit) ‘get married (of a woman)’: a question s@-k@-k
ra:l? (who-obl-dat sit+3fem.sgbas.p) always has the meaning of ‘Who did she marry?’ One
can question yawi in yawi kur- ‘work’, but not sua:l in sua:l kur- or its synonym sua:l taka- ‘lie,
tell a lie’.
   In such idiomatic constructions the verb itself may be so easily recoverable from the context
that it can be omitted in elliptical discourse, as shown in 17.54. A woman says 17.54 to the
spirit, and the spirit answers 17.55.
17.54 [ata wa-l@-l],                          [wun-a:k sua:l kur-ñ@n-@k]
      then say-3fem.sgsubj.p-3fem.sgbas.p I-lk+dat lie       do-2fem.sgbas.vt-conf
      ‘Then she said to her, “You are telling a lie to me” ’
17.55 wun sua:l ma:
      I     lie   no
      ‘I am not (telling) a lie’
   There appears to be a continuum between semantically compositional constructions con-
taining polyfunctional verbs, and fully lexicalized idiomatic entities. These idiomatic colloca-
tions have to be listed in a dictionary.
   We will now turn to the discussion of another set of constructions which show semantic and
formal aﬃnity with lexicalized complex predicates.
           17.4 b o dy pa rt c o n s t ru c t i o n s a s c o m p l e x p r e d i c at e sBody part constructions consist of a formally unmarked noun followed by a semantically
appropriate verb. The noun is a body part, or a physical or other state with respect to which the
process is happening. Such constructions describe states, and thus cannot occur in aspectual
and modal complex predicates (§17.1).
   Many body part constructions in Manambu are composed of a physical state or a body part
nominal followed by one of the polyfunctional verbs listed in Table 4.1, e.g. ka:m ‘hunger’ as in
ka:m yasa-/yas@- ‘feel hunger’ and s@ ‘sleep’ in s@ yasa-/yas@- ‘feel sleepy’ (see other examples
in 4.26a–d and 17.56a). The order of components is ﬁxed.
440     17 Complex Predicates17.56a l@ s@       ma: ya:s
       she sleep neg be:desire:neg
       ‘She is not sleepy’
  The noun gu ‘water’ in combination with yasa-/yas@- describes thirst, in the Avatip variety:
17.56b gu     yasa-na
       water be:desire-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt
       ‘(I) am thirsty’
  In the Yuanab variety, the body part term kwa:l ‘throat’ is used instead: kwa:l yasa- means
‘be thirsty’.
  They may also contain verbs other than polyfunctional verbs to do with feelings, e.g. ji- and
sakwi- ‘be fed up’ (always used with s@p ‘skin, body’: see 4.45), or yaga- ‘be scared’. The verb
war- ‘go up’ is often used with mawul ‘inside’, to indicate a state of excitement (as in 14.87),
or a physical state, as in 17.57a. The experiencer is not cross-referenced on the verb. It can be
supplied if necessary: in 17.57a ‘I’ appears in brackets since it is optional. The bodily states
typically belong to the functionally unmarked feminine gender, and this explains the feminine
cross-referencing on the verb:
17.57a (wun) d@pugw@l war-na
       (I)   hiccup      go.up-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt
       ‘Hiccup (or burp) appears’ (lit. goes up)
  The verb waku- ‘go out’ is used with wa:gw ‘sweat’ as in 17.58a. Again, the experiencer is not
cross-referenced, and is optional.
17.58a (ñ@n)    wa:gw waku-na
       you.fem sweat go.out-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt
       ‘(You) come out in sweat; sweat is coming out on you’
   As mentioned in §17.2, the body part components in such constructions are similar to the
nominal parts of lexicalized complex predicates. They are formally unmarked and are never
cross-referenced on the verb. The nominal component does not aﬀect the verb’s transitivity;
and so it is likely not to be part of the verb’s argument structure.
   All constructions involving body parts allow for variation in their cross-referencing. An
alternative to saying 4.45, ‘skin is tired’, is 4.46, ‘(I) am skin-tired’. Along similar lines, an
alternative to 17.57a is 17.57b and to 17.58a is 17.58b. This property is not found with complex
predicates of any other sort.
17.57b (wun) d@pugw@l war-na-wun
       (I)     hiccup    go.up-act.foc-1fem.sgbas.vt
       ‘I hiccup (or burp)’ (lit. ‘I go up in hiccuping/burping’)
17.58b wa:gw waku-na-ñ@n
       sweat go.out-act.foc-2fem.sgbas.vt
       ‘You come out in sweat; sweat is coming out on you’
   The diﬀerence between the two pairs is pragmatic. The experiencer is more likely to be cross-
referenced if focused—if the speaker is focusing on their own state or that of their interlocutor,
they are more likely to use the b-version. In 17.59a, the speaker is talking about his own urgent
desire, focusing on himself. In the second line, he rephrases the statement about his desire to
have a shit by using a desiderative with an overt pronoun:
                                     17.4 Body part constructions as complex predicates      44117.59a wun di         yasa-na-d@wun                   wun di yi-k@r
       I      faeces be:desire-act.foc-1masc.sgbas.vt I   shit go-des
       ‘I feel like having a shit, I want to shit’  An alternative would have been 17.59b, from a dialogue—which is a normal way of stating
one’s need:17.59b ñ@n      akr@l?    di yasa-na
       you.fem where.to shit be:desire-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt
       ‘ “Where are you (going)?” “I feel like having a shit” (lit. shit feels)’   Note that no such option is available for complex verbs which do not contain a body part
term, e.g. s@ kwa- ‘sleep’.
   When a body part construction is used in a dependent clause, the bodily state is cross-
referenced on the verb, and the construction requires diﬀerent subject marking—despite the
fact that the same person may be experiencing the state and performing subsequent actions,
as in 17.60. In a main clause, an experiencer in body part constructions can be either back-
grounded, as in 17.57a, 17.58a, or 17.59b, or foregrounded, as in 17.57b, 17.58b, and 17.59a.
A dependent clause does not allow this option: the experiencer is always backgrounded.
This is in line with a generally backgrounded character of information within dependent
clauses.
   Take 17.60. The main clause foregrounds ‘me’, the experiencer, who is cross-referenced on
the polyfunctional verb ‘be:desire’. Once in a dependent clause within a head-tail linking
structure, the experiencer is backgrounded, and not cross-referenced on the verb of feeling.
A diﬀerent subject sequencing marker is typically required:17.60 [ka:m yasa-na-wun],                          [ka:m yasa-l@-k]
      hunger be:desire-act.foc-1fem.sgbas.vt hunger be:desire-3fem.sg-compl.ds
      [wa-tua]
      say-1sgsubj.vt+3fem.sgbas.vt
      ‘I am hungry, after I felt hunger (lit. after hunger felt), I am telling (my uncles to feed
      me)’  We return to the problem of subjecthood in body part constructions in §20.1.4.
  Body part constructions often involve terms denoting physical locations of mental states.
The most frequent one is mawul ‘inside’, e.g. mawul war- (inside go.up) ‘be excited, angry’,
mawul wuk@- (inside think) ‘worry’ (see 14.86–7), mawul taka- (inside put) ‘agree, be agreeable
to’, mawul wa- (inside say) ‘think’. Another one is ya:l ‘belly’, as in ya:l gra- (belly cry) ‘be
angry’ (see further discussion in §21.4). Similar constructions involve physical concepts, such
as being itchy, as in 17.61a–b, or full, as in 17.62a–b. As in the examples above, the diﬀerence
between versions a and b here lies in the focus on the experiencer. Examples with third person
cross-referencing allow for an impersonal reading.17.61a s@p wusau-k-na
       skin be.itchy-fut-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt
       ‘Skin will be itchy (for I/you, or a person in general)’17.61b wun s@p wusau-k-na-wun
       I      skin be.itchy-fut-act.foc-1fem.sgbas.vt
       ‘I will be itchy in my skin (that is, my skin will be itchy)’
442      17 Complex Predicates17.62a ya:l wapruku-na
       belly overﬂow-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt
       ‘Belly is overfull’ (that is, I am very full)
17.62b ya:l wapruku-na-wun
       belly overﬂow-act.foc-1fem.sgbas.vt
       ‘Belly is overfull’ (that is, I am very full)
  In 17.61b and 17.62b, ‘I’ cannot be interpreted as possessor of the body part because of the
potential pause between ‘I’ and the body part atypical for possessive NPs.
  To describe properties of inanimate entities, a similar construction type is used. Then, only
third person can be cross-referenced, as in 17.63–4:
17.63 [t@b g@l       war-na]                          [wa:l ja-k@r]
      sky blackness go.up-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt rain rain-des
      ‘Sky is becoming black (lit. Sky goes up in terms of blackness), it is wanting to rain’
17.64 day   yi v@r-k-na
      mouth ﬁre burn-fut-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt
      ‘Mouth will burn’ (lit. ‘burn in terms of ﬁre’) (if you eat hot pepper)
  The semantic function of g@l in 17.63 and yi in 17.64 is similar to manner, or instrument.
Formally unmarked body part terms such as m@l ‘eye’ and wa:n ‘ear’ can be used in a similar
meaning with verbs of perception, to stress their telic perceptual meanings. We will see, in
§21.1.2, that v@- ‘see’ also means ‘try’ and ‘experience’, while wuk@- has a wide range of
meanings from ‘hear’ and ‘listen’ to ‘obey’ and ‘worry’. In 17.65 v@- can only refer to ‘looking’,
and in 17.66 wuk@- only refers to ‘listening’ (see §21.1.2):
17.65 m@l ap
      eye impv+see
      ‘Look!’
17.66 wa:n a-wuk
      ear impv-hear/listen
      ‘Listen!’ (lit. ‘ear listen’)
   Functionally, ‘eye’ and ‘ear’ in 17.65–6 are similar to other nominal components of complex
verbs, e.g. gu ‘water’ in gu yaku- (water wash) ‘bathe; wash oneself’, and yanu ‘magic’ in yanu
bla- (magic talk) ‘cast a magic spell’.
   Just like with other complex predicates, very few elements can intervene between the compo-
nents of such constructions. Body part constructions are more semantically predictable than
lexicalized complex predicates, and their components can be used on their own. Similarly to
complex predicates of other types, they consist of two grammatical words (which are also two
phonological words) in one predicate slot and form somewhat idiomatic collocations.

                               involv ing clause chainingTransitivity-neutralizing constructions involving clause-chaining markers (§16.2.3) are similar
in structure and meaning to the aspectual complex predicates discussed in §17.1.1 above. They
consist of a verb with a switch-reference-sensitive clause-chaining marker followed by one of
the three positional polyfunctional verbs: t@- ‘stand’, r@- ‘sit’ or kwa- ‘stay’.
                                            17.5 Transitivity-neutralizing constructions      443   In 17.67, the dependent verb is marked as completive. The meaning of the whole construction
is akin to the anterior meaning of complex predicates with verb t@- discussed in §17.1: the bags
have been overﬂowing with money, and the fact that they remained in this state was relevant
for the story as a whole:17.67 wapwi-wa wapwi-wa wapruku-ku           t@-di
      bag-com bag-com overﬂow-compl.ss stand-3plbas.vt/p
      ‘The bags have been overﬂowing (with money)’ (lit. having overﬂowed with money they
      remained (this way) ) If the action of the dependent clause is described as prolonged and overlapping with the
main clause, the cotemporaneous sequencing marker -ta:y is used, as in 17.68:17.68 kwar@b yis@wul-ta:y         ta:d                     mi:r war-@n
      bush    turn.into-cotemp stand+3masc.sgbas.vt/p up go.up-seq
      ‘He was turning (into a wild bird) in the bush, going upwards (to tree tops)’ (lit. ‘As he
      was turning (into a wild bird) he stood going upwards’)  As shown in §16.2.3, the dependent verb can be marked for diﬀerent subject, as in 17.69, if
the two actions are closely related and the O of the ﬁrst verb is identical to the S of the second
verb.17.69 yi-pakw@-d@-k                        d@ ata ra:d
      go-be.hidden-3masc.sg-compl.ds he then sit+3masc.sgbas.vt/p
      ‘He stayed (in a sitting position) hidden’ (lit. ‘he having hidden (him) he sat’)  The choice of the polyfunctional verb partly depends on the duration of the ensuing result,
and partly on the position of the S. In 17.69, the connotation is that the man was in hiding for
some time in a sitting position. If the duration had been irrelevant, the verb t@- would be used,
as in 17.70.17.70 adula                     t@pam               yi-pakwu-da-k
      dem.dist.inland+masc.sg village+lk+loc go-be.hidden-3pl-compl.ds
      ta:d
      stand+3masc.sgbas.vt/p
      ‘He stayed hidden in the inland village’ (lit. After they had hidden him in the village
      inland, he stayed)  The verb kwa- ‘stay’ is used in similar structures to describe prolonged resulting state, as in
17.71.17.71 yi-n     wula:-n a                  t@pa:m            r@-ku
      go-seq enter-seq dem.dist.fem.sg village+lk+loc sit/live-compl.ss
      kwa-dana
      stay-3plsubj.vt+3fem.sgbas.vt
      ‘Having gone in and out (lit. gone and entered) they remained in that village’ (lit. ‘having
      lived in that village they stayed’)  As shown in §16.2.3, on the surface these constructions appear to be biclausal. Yet, they
tend to be treated as one predicate head since the two verbs cannot be negated separately, and
have a fused argument structure. Their semantics is very similar to that of aspectual complex
predicates. They are best considered as emergent complex predicates.

  criteria:    1. Types of inflected verb: polyfunctional verbs are used in complex predicates containing
       auxiliaries and support verbs, while lexicalized complex predicates and body part con-
       structions can contain other verbs. This agrees with the major property of polyfunctional
       verbs: their ability to be used as grammatical markers.","[458, 459, 460, 461, 462, 463, 464, 465, 466, 467, 468, 469, 470, 471]"

                             10.6.1 Numerals from one to tenNumerals from one to ten are given in Table 10.8, together with an indication of their addi-
tional meanings and composition (for numbers over four).
   Numerals ‘one’, ‘two’, and ‘three’ diﬀer from other numerals in that they have meanings
additional to counting. Numeral ‘one’ stands apart from other numerals in a number of
properties outlined in A below. Numbers ‘two’ and ‘three’ are discussed in B and C respectively.
Words for ‘ﬁve’ and ‘ten’ contain the term for ‘hand, arm’.
   Numbers ‘two’ to ‘ten’ can be employed as prehead or posthead modiﬁers; their position in a
noun phrase depends on whether the noun referent is newly introduced or already established,
and whether it is focused on. Just as with quantiﬁers (§10.5), a newly introduced referent is
followed by the numeral. In contrast, number ‘one’ always follows the noun.
   Numerals one to ten form one grammatical word. Numerals one to four are underived.
Number ﬁve contains the root for ‘hand’, ta:b-, and the formative -a:b, which could be cognate
to -a:b ‘too’, or to aba:b ‘all’ (see §22.1 on this being a possible calque from Kwoma). Ordinal

numbers can be formed on cardinal terms from ‘two’ to ‘ten’, using the suﬃx -yay attached
to the linker, as in viti-a-yay (two-lk-ord) ‘second’, mugul-a-yay ‘third’, and so on. Ordinal
numbers are non-agreeing modiﬁers, similar to quantiﬁers and cardinal numbers ‘two’ to ‘ten’,
in that they occur postposed to a new or non-topical referent, as in 10.129:

       ‘This is a third village; it is (the case) that we settled in the third village’
  Ordinal numerals occur preposed to a topically established or deﬁnite referent (see §20.2):
10.130 a                  mugul-a-yay wiya:r     yi-l@-l
       dem.dist.fem.sg three-lk-ord house+lk+all go-3fem.sgsubj.p-3fem.sgbas.p
       aka
       dem.dist.react.top.fem.sg
       ‘It is that she went to that third house’
  An ordinal numeral can be used without a nominal head, and it can then take the appropriate
case marker, as in 10.129. This is in contrast to cardinal numbers which do not take case
marking.
All numbers can be used in counting, as in ‘one, two, three’, and as modiﬁers; the number ‘one’
is unique in that the form used for counting (or number recital) is diﬀerent from forms used in
most other contexts.
A. Number ‘one’ has three forms. The form nakam@y has two uses: it occurs in counting ‘one,
two, three’, as shown in 10.131—an incitement for the two children who are diving to come up
again:
10.131 nakam@y viti mugul a:li, taba:b, a-war-@y
       one       two three four ﬁve        impv-go.up-voc
       ‘One, two, three, four, ﬁve—up you go!’
As mentioned in §5.1.1, nakam@y can be used as a prehead modiﬁer meaning ‘only one, one
(of many)’. Then it optionally takes an inﬁxed gender agreement marker: naka-d@-m@y means
‘only one (masculine)’, and naka-m@y ‘only one’ is feminine. This refers to one turtle out of
many in 10.132:
236     10 Closed Classes10.132 nakam@y-a           gwa:s aka                      ya-na
       one.single.fem-lk turtle dem.dist.react.top.fem.sg come-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt
       ‘One single turtle (out of many) came’
  In 10.133, the masculine form refers to the only child:
10.133 wun-a-d@     nak-a-d@-m@y-a           du-a-ñan        ad@ka
       I-lk-masc.sg one-lk-masc.sg-very-lk man-lk-child dem.dist.react.top+masc.sg
       t@-na-d
       stand-act.foc-3masc.sgbas.vt
       ‘My only son (about whom we are talking again) is standing (here)’
   This form is the only one in the language to distinguish two gender forms, but no number
forms. The use of nakam@y in counting goes together with the functionally unmarked character
of the feminine gender. These forms are likely to be compounds consisting of nak- ‘one’, -a-
‘linker’, followed by the gender marker (-d(@) ‘masculine’, ø ‘feminine’), and m@y ‘real; very’.
   The two further forms, nak and n@, are both used as posthead modiﬁers and are almost
synonymous: one can refer to children of the same mother (or to those who belong to the
same maternal clan) as ya:l nak waku-di or ya:l n@ waku-di (belly one come.out-3plbas.vt)
‘they came out of the same belly’. Both jay@b nak and jay@b n@ mean ‘one moment, quickly,
instantaneously’. In enumerating objects one by one, the form n@ appears to be somewhat
preferred. Both nak and n@ can mark indeﬁnite and newly introduced referents. In 10.134,
from the very beginning of a story, the speaker introduced the referent as ta:kw nak (woman
one) ‘a woman’. A variant ta:kw n@ is also used in the same function.
10.134 ta:kw nak l@-k@-di     ñan-ugw@wa    kwa:l
       woman one she-obl-pl child-pl+lk+com stay+3fem.sgbas.p
       ‘One woman lived with her children’
  However, there are a number of diﬀerences between nak and n@, along the following lines:
1. The numeral nak, but not n@, can be used without a nominal head, as in:
10.135 kudi       nak ak         wa-di          nak ata ka:l
       mouthful one impv+eat say-3plbas.p one then eat+3fem.sgbas.p
       ‘ “Eat one mouthful!”, they said, she then ate one (mouthful)’
  It can also head a predicate, which is not the case for n@, and can have a meaning of ‘same
(as previous)’, as in 10.136:
10.136 ma:j        nak-al
       word/talk one-3fem.sgnom
       ‘This is the same word’
2. The numeral nak (but not n@) often has the meaning of ‘another, one more’. In 10.137,
Walinum volunteers to tell another short story. Nak ‘another one’ is used headlessly; it can
have the same meaning as a modiﬁer.
10.137 wun-a           kwasa           ma: nak aka
       I-lk+fem.sg small+fem.sg again one dem.dist.react.top.fem.sg
       wa-k@-tua
       tell-fut-1sgsubj.vt+3fem.sgbas.vt
       ‘I will tell another little one of mine again’
                                                                        10.6 Numerals        237This use of nak is reminiscent of the use of the indeﬁnite n@k@ ‘another’, illustrated in 10.3
and 10.52. It is possible that forms nak, n@, and n@k@ are etymologically related. In rapid
casual speech, n@k@ can be pronounced as n@ (in agreement with A3 under §2.6), e.g. rapid
speech n@ ja:p n@ ja:p kur-ku, normal speech n@k@ ja:p n@k@ ja:p kur-ku (another.fem.sg thing
another.fem.sg thing get-compl.ss) ‘having taken one thing and another’. Unlike both nak and
n@, n@k@ is an agreeing prehead modiﬁer.
3. The numeral nak can be used in opposition to other numbers, while n@ is not used this way.
An example is under 10.138—a description of what happens during warfare:
10.138 du nak ak@s         kiya-kwa-na-d              d@y viti, mugul, a:li, ata
       man one neg.hab die-hab-act.foc-3masc.sgbas.vt they two three four then
       kiya-kwa-na-di
       die-hab-act.foc-3plbas.vt
       ‘One man never dies, two, three, four die’
  The form n@ is only occasionally used in opposition to another number, but never more than
one, as in 10.139:
10.139 bap       n@ t@-k@-na-d@wun-@k                         o bap       viti t@-ku
       month one stay-fut-act.foc-1masc.sgbas.vt-conf or month two stay-compl.ss
       ya-k-na-d@wun-@k
       come-fut-act.foc-1masc.sgbas.vt-conf
       ‘I will stay (away) for one month, or I will come back having stayed (away) two months’
4. Only nak and not n@ can undergo full reduplication. A reduplicated form nak-a-nak (one-
lk-one) has two meanings: ‘one by one’, as in 10.140, and ‘few, not too many’, as in 10.141.
10.140 nak-a-nak kur-ta:y       s@pur-taka-bana
       one-lk-one get-cotemp shell-put-1plsubj.vt+3fem.sgbas.vt
       ‘Having got (peanuts) one by one we shell them’
10.141 wur@bi-adi              k@-di,         nak-a-nak adiya
       large.mosquito-3plnom dem.prox-pl one-lk-one dem.dist.react.top+pl
       ‘These are large mosquitoes, they are few’ (since this is dry season)
This same form can be used adverbially, meaning ‘one by one’, as in 21.4. These uses may well
have resulted from a Tok Pisin inﬂuence: cf. Tok Pisin wan wan ‘few’; wanpela wanpela ‘one by
one’. Nowadays they are part of everyday usage. The ﬁnal k can be elided in fast speech.
5. The form nak is strongly preferred to n@ in complex numbers higher than ten (see §10.6.2).
In its use as a marker of newly introduced referents, the numeral ‘one’ is inﬂuenced by a similar
usage of the number ‘one’, wanpela, in Tok Pisin. Young speakers, especially children and
teenagers whose major language of communication is Tok Pisin, display a peculiar pattern
of code-switching, introducing a new referent, for example wanpela ta:kw (one:TP woman)
and then correcting this to ta:kw nak (as in 10.134). Some speakers even use both Tok Pisin
and Manambu lexemes in this same function, as shown in §22.4 (wanpela du nak (one:TP man
one) ‘a man’). This is unusual since the Tok Pisin numeral does not go into the same slot as its
Manambu correspondent, but rather keeps the Tok Pisin linear order. In most instances, a Tok
Pisin number occurs together with a Tok Pisin word, as in wanpela taim (one time) ‘once’ (see
Aikhenvald forthcoming c).
   As shown in §5.1.1, the root nak occurs in two other forms, nak-a-l-@b (one-lk-fem.sg-term)
‘together’ (of a group consisting of women only, or of a mixed group) and its synonym nakamib
238     10 Closed Classes‘together’ (which is most likely derived from nakam@y and the terminative case frequently
employed in deriving adverbs)—see 16.106.
   Unlike other numbers, ‘one’ has the adverb ta:y ‘ﬁrst’ in lieu of a corresponding ordinal
number, as in 4.61, 13.15, and T2.47. An alternative term is an adverb bas ‘ﬁrstly’, as in bas
yawi waku-n (ﬁrst work go.out-seq) ‘going out to work for the ﬁrst time’. The term for last is
gañ. Further terms involving the idea of being ﬁrst or last include g@m ‘ﬁrst pregnancy’, k@-
t@p-@ m@ñ (eat-close-lk breast) ‘last child’, amay ta:kw (mother woman/wife) ‘ﬁrst wife’, g@ñ-a
ta:kw (last-lk wife) ‘non-ﬁrst wife’; ap-a s@ (bone-lk name) ‘ﬁrst name’ (of the many names
one has), as contrasted to s@gliak ‘any name other than the ﬁrst one’. The term kuk@-s@buk
(late-sibuk) ‘the latest/most senior of all initiated men (simbuks)’ was suggested as a term for
‘ﬁrst priest’.
B. Number ‘two’ has an additional, non-numerical, meaning. We saw in Table 6.1 that the
numeral viti or its cliticized version -v@ti marks dual on several kin terms.
  Case marking on NPs provides a way of distinguishing viti as a dual marker and viti as
number two (also see B in §6.1). When the number ‘two’ acts as a number, it does not take case
marking—we saw in 7.50 that this is a general property of numbers. This is shown in 10.142.
10.142 [asa:k          viti] yaga-na
       dog+lk+dat two be.afraid-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt
       ‘She is afraid of two dogs’
In contrast, a noun marked for dual takes case marking:
10.143 d@-k@-b@r jukwar-a-v@ti:k wapa-ku
       he-poss-du sister-lk-du+dat leave-compl.ss
       ‘Having left his two sisters . . . ’
The number ‘two’, when reduplicated, has a somewhat idiomatic meaning of ‘muddled’, as in
10.144—this was Kawindu’s explanation for a mess up in local ﬂights:
10.144 ma:j viti-viti t@-na-b@r
       story two-two have-act.foc-3dubas.vt
       ‘They two tell muddled stories’ (lit. have two stories each?)
C. Number ‘three’ as a cardinal number has an additional, non-numerical quantifying meaning
of ‘a few, several’. Whether mugul is used in a numerical meaning or not is usually clear from
the context. In 7.50, we were leaving exactly three days later. In 10.131 and 10.138, mugul is one
of the numbers used in counting. In 10.145, mugul ‘few’ is contrasted to another quantiﬁer—it
cannot possibly mean ‘three’.
10.145 orait mugul æywan ma:, mugul-a-b@            da-di
       alright few    many neg few-lk-already go.down-3plbas.p
       ‘OK, (there were) few, not many, few people went down (river)’
When an ordinal number is formed on ‘three’, its meaning is always strictly numerical, as in
10.130. A noun phrase with the quantiﬁer mugul ‘few’ can trigger dual agreement, if the number
of referents is about two, as in 6.40. Or it can trigger plural agreement, if there are more than
two referents, as in 10.146. If mugul means ‘three’, agreement is always plural.
10.146 gurawa         mugul-a bal-adi,       wun samasa:m-adi
       you+lk+com few-lk pig-3plnom I              many-3plnom
       ‘There are few pigs with you, I, (my pigs) are many’
                                                                            10.6 Numerals         239   The non-numerical quantiﬁer usage of mugul suggests that its numerical meaning is relatively
recent. This is corroborated by the data from other Ndu languages: while terms for ‘one’ and
‘two’ are relatively stable throughout the family, the terms for numerals from three onwards
vary. The Iatmul form for ‘three’ can also mean ‘few’ (Jendraschek forthcoming). (The two
forms equally reconstructible for Proto-Ndu ‘three’ are ∗ m@g@l and ∗ k@ p(w)@k; their reﬂexes
are scattered across the family: see Aikhenvald forthcoming b.)
   Numerals ‘two’ and ‘three’ can take the derivational suﬃx -k@r @b ‘together’, as in viti-k@r @b
‘two together’ and mugul-a-k@r@b ‘three together’ (but not ∗ a few together). Both numbers have
a strictly numerical meaning in such derivations (see 10.47). A derivation containing -k@r@b can
be used to refer to humans, as in T3.52 (where it modiﬁes a pronoun, ‘they two, two of them
together’). It can modify a noun with a non-human referent, as in 10.147. This is an example
of a split noun phrase:10.147 viti-k@r@b    avæs        mæn
       two-together impv+step foot
       ‘Step with two feet together!’ (while walking on a narrow log in lieu of a bridge)Just like any numeral, a derivation marked with -k@r@b can be used as a posthead modiﬁer, as
in 10.47, or as a prehead modiﬁer. In the latter case, the noun takes a modiﬁcation marker, e.g.
viti-k@r@b-a ta:kw (two-together-lk woman) ‘two women together’ (e.g. two co-wives).
   Numbers from ‘two’ to ‘ten’ can occur with the approximative suﬃx -p@k ‘more or less’, e.g.
9.35, and with -r@b ‘fully’ (see §9.2.1). If combined with either suﬃx, the number mugul has a
strictly numerical meaning, ‘three’. The number ‘one’ does not combine with any suﬃxes.","[261, 262, 263, 264, 265, 266]"
"                                         20.4.3 EllipsisBeing elaborate and precise is a skill highly appreciated for story tellers and orators in the
Manambu speech communities. In contrast, day-to-day speech is highly elliptical. If a noun
phrase is recoverable from the context, it won’t be overtly mentioned. In 20.36a and 20.36b
the referents of the full pronouns were obvious (‘me’ and ‘you feminine’), so they did not
have to be stated. And we saw that in 20.41 the subject was omitted—also because it is clear
from the context. In 8.4 only the gender agreement shows that the possessed noun ‘house’ has
been omitted. This was Yipawal’s answer to my question ‘Where is your house?’ The reply
was, literally, ‘I this one (masculine)’. Further possibilities of ellipsis are illustrated with the
following snippets of dialogue.
   Consider 20.92–3. The sentence under a is a question, and b is an answer to it. The question
in 20.92a is itself elliptical: we were talking about some women going to Maprik to sell ﬁsh, so
this part is not stated:20.92a s@-k@-dadi           yi-k-na-di?
       who-obl-3pl+3plnom go-fut-act.foc-3plbas.vt
       ‘Who is going (to Maprik to sell ﬁsh)?’ (lit. Who are going?)  The idea of the answer in 20.92b is that the speaker was going to ﬁnd out who was going and
then give them money to buy her some hair cream:20.92b kwak@-ku      kui-k@-tua-di
       ﬁnd-compl.ss give.to.third.p-fut-1sgsubj.vt-3plbas.vt
       ‘Having found (them), I will give (it: money) to them’
                                             20.4 Further issues in discourse organization         547  In 20.93a, the speaker asks the guest whether he’d come from Yawabak on foot. Note the
absence of the overt pronoun: it is omitted, since the cross-referencing on the inﬂected verb
conveys who the subject is:
20.93a n@b@-say               ya-na-d@m@n?
       dry.ground+lk-transp come-act.foc-2masc.sgbas.vt
       ‘Have you come on foot?’ (lit. via dry ground)
   The addressee replies, omitting the main verb. The dependent clause is postposed to the
elliptical main clause (which consists just of the instrument, ‘with a canoe’), as a clariﬁcation:
the speaker wants the audience to know that he came all the way just paddling (and therefore
is tired and wouldn’t mind refreshments).
20.93b [vala-r@b]         [gus   kan]
       canoe+lk-fully paddle paddle+seq
       ‘Straight with a canoe, paddling a paddle’
The main verb can only be omitted if it has been introduced in the preceding discourse.
For instance, if A says wali-kamna:gw ak@s k@-kwa-na (white.people-food neg.hab eat-hab-
act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt) ‘she never eats white people’s food’, B is likely to add wun-aba:b ak@s
(I-too neg.hab) ‘I too never’. The latter clause would not make sense on its own, taken out
of context. In 20.94—an example of a desubordinated clause, similar to 19.113b—both object
and verb have been omitted from the second clause:
20.94 d@-k@             buk al@-da:m                      taka-ku         wun api:m
      he-poss+fem.sg book dem.dist+fem.sg-down+loc put-compl.ss I             top+loc
      ‘I have put his notebook underneath, and mine on top’ (lit. having put)
   Elliptical clauses are very frequent in informal interaction. We saw in §19.9 how desubordi-
nated clauses—which can be considered the result of conventionalized ellipsis—are employed
as command strategies. An elliptic clause can be used as a command, with a particularly strong
illocutionary force (similar to desubordinated medial clauses in Table 19.5), e.g. ap k@ka (bone
dem.prox.react.top.fem.sg) ‘This bone!’ meaning ‘Put this bone here (or put it down) (or
else)!’
   Instead of producing a full clause, as in 7.29, people would just shout: ak@m t@-ku?
(where+loc stay-compl.ss) ‘where (are you/(s)he/they) coming from?’ And we can recall that
just one word, marked with dative, is enough to verbalize an impending threat: Tanina would
shout diya:k (shit+lk+dat) ‘(beware) of (dog’s) shit’, and I would know to watch my step.
Along similar lines, a reciprocal marker was omitted in 14.114, since the sentence can only
have a reciprocal reading.
   If a support verb, or an auxiliary, is easy to supply, it can also be omitted, as in 20.95–6, and
in 17.49–50—this latter was uttered by an angry speaker immediately on entering our house
one Saturday. The context was clear; and the form luku only occurs with the verb kur- —so no
ambiguity could possibly arise. A similar example is at 20.95a: the support verb which occurs
with sua:l is either kur- or taka-; so it appears to be easily omissible in a quick dialogue (from
a story):
20.95a [ñ@n      sua:l kur-ñ@n-@k]                 [wa-l@-k]                [ka
       you.fem lie       do-2fem.sgbas.vt-conf say-3fem.sg-compl.ds dem.prox.fem.sg
       wun sua:l ma:]
       I     lie    neg
       ‘ “You are lying (lit. doing a lie)”, she having said, (the other said), “no! (lit. this!), I am
       not lying (lit. I a lie not)” ’
548     20 Clause Types and Discourse-Pragmatic DevicesThe last clause without ellipsis would be rendered as in 20.95b (the ellided word is underlined,
here and in the further examples in this section):
20.95b wun sua:l ma: kwa:r
       I     lie   neg do+neg
       ‘I am not lying’ (lit. I am not doing a lie)
  Along similar lines, mak@n ‘be in mourning’ can be omitted from a complex predicate with
kwa-ya- (stay-come), as in 20.96a. This verb is typically used in combination with ‘mourning’.
The aﬀected participant is overtly expressed and the context states that he or she had indeed
died. This makes ‘mourning’ recoverable from the context, and thus dispensable.
20.96a [kiya-d@-k]              [ya:kya] [d@-k@-k       kwa-ya-di]
       die-3masc.sg-compl:ds OK            he-obl-dat stay-come-3plbas.p
       ‘After he’d died, OK, (his relatives) stayed (in mourning) for him’
  The full clause, without ellipsis, would be:
20.96b [kiya-d@-k]              [ya:kya] [d@-k@-k       mak@n        kwa-ya-di]
       die-3masc.sg-compl:ds OK            he-obl-dat in.mourning stay-come-3plbas.p
       ‘After he’d died, OK, (his relatives) stayed in mourning for him’
   If a support verb is omitted from the main clause, and the clause takes part in the bridging
repetition (or ‘head-tail’) linkage, only the support verb gets repeated in the following medial
clause. This is a frequent feature of any narrative, not just of a conversation. An example is at
20.97a. A pause indicates that there is a clause boundary.
20.97a [yi:n   gan kus@m]         [pause] [na-l@-k]                [ya:k]
       go+seq night ﬁnish+compl pause be:nat-3fem.sg-compl.ds OK
       [ada                       kwa-na-d]
       dem.dist.react.top+masc.sg stay-act.foc-3masc.sgbas.vt
       ‘As it went on and on, the night ﬁnished completely. It having ﬁnished, OK, he
       remained’
The same sentence without ellipsis is at 20.97b.
20.97b [yi:n    gan kus@m           na:l]                 [pause] [kus@m
       go+seq night ﬁnish+compl be:nat+3fem.sgbas.p pause ﬁnish+compl
       na-l@-k]                 [ya:k] [ada
       be:nat-3fem.sg-compl.ds ok       dem.dist.react.top+masc.sg
       kwa-na-d]
       stay-act.foc-3masc.sgbas.vt
       ‘As it went on and on, the night ﬁnished completely. It having ﬁnished, OK, he
       remained’
  The support verb here is uniquely identiﬁable because this is the only one that can occur
with uninﬂected completive aspect (see §17.2)—so there is no need to state it in the main clause.
Neither is there any need to repeat the complement of the support verb since it has just been
mentioned.
  Any support verb can be omitted in the same way. We recall, from 17.39–40, that a nominal
m@k@m@k ‘silent’ takes a support verb r@- ‘sit’ or t@- ‘stand, be’. In narratives of any kind it
often occurs on its own, without a support verb, as in 20.98a:
                                             20.4 Further issues in discourse organization    54920.98a [ada                           da-na-d]                  [m@k@m@k]
       dem.dist.react.top+masc.sg go.down-act.foc-3masc.sgbas.p silent
       ‘He went down, (being) silent’
  A version without ellipsis is at 20.98b:
20.98b [ada                           da-na-d]                  [m@k@m@k

       t@-ku]
       ‘stand’-compl.ss
       ‘He went down, (being) silent’
   This is the only type of ellipsis pervasive in any type of discourse.
   A lexical verb can be omitted from clauses with the generic completive napa- (see §18.9)
if understood within the given context. The fact that the child had ﬁnished staying there is
understood—there is nothing else the child was supposed to do after he’d been put there. The
elliptical clause is underlined. Its unelided form would have been kwa-n napa-d@-k (stay-seq
compl.vb-3masc.sg-compl.ds).

      bring.up-put-1plsubj.vt-3masc.sgbas.vt
      ‘We then used to carry that child together, having carried (him), we put him down (lit.
      having put her by carrying down), OK, after he’d completed (staying there), we take him
      and put him (there) carrying (him)’
Switch-reference (diﬀerent subject marking in the clause with napa-) helps track the referents.
Note that this is an example of a mismatch in gender agreement (see §5.2.2). The masculine
child is small, and so is referred to with the feminine form of the demonstrative; but it is male,
and so is cross-referenced with the masculine singular on the verb.
   Even a part of a ﬁxed expression can be omitted, if the speaker chooses to do so. As can be
seen from the endings of the three texts at the end of this grammar (T1.35, T2.69, and T3.53),
when a story ﬁnishes, it ‘goes inside the base’. One very long story that the speaker chose to
tell several times ended with:
20.100a gabu-maj           wula-d                         aka
        traditional-story come.inside-3masc.sgbas.p dem.prox.react.top+fem.sg
        ‘The (long) traditional story is over’ (lit. goes inside)
  What he could have said, had he not chosen to be elliptical, is:
20.100b gabu-ma:j          maw@r           wula-d
        traditional-story base+lk+all come.inside-3masc.sgbas.p
        aka
        dem.prox.react.top+fem.sg
        ‘The (long) traditional story is over’ (lit. goes inside the base)
550     20 Clause Types and Discourse-Pragmatic Devices   Such omissions are indicative of speakers who are less careful in how they lay out their
narratives. And it is perhaps not a coincidence that speakers who tend to be elliptical are not
among the most eloquent orators. That is, Manambu discourse presents a curious combination
of both explicitness and ellipsis. This is comparable to the structure and use of the lexicon—
which also combines a high degree of precision with the ever-present option of using a generic
term. This is the topic of our next chapter.
         21         Issues in Semantics and Features of Lexicon
Throughout this grammar we have dwelt upon the semantic content of various word classes,
including nouns (§4.1.2), verbs (§4.2.2), the two classes of adjectives (§4.3.3), and adverbs (§4.4).
This chapter focuses on a number of salient features of the Manambu lexicon in general.
   Speakers often conceive of their languages in terms of lexicon, putting primary value on
the knowledge of words. In the Manambu tradition, knowledge—viewed in terms of lexicon,
especially the totemic names—is tantamount to monetary riches. In other words, the more
names one knows the richer one is: these include personal names, terms of address, and
denominations of culturally important items owned by diﬀerent clans in general. The issue
of name ownership acquires particular importance at name debates (saki). A man’s oratorical
skill plainly depends not so much on his eloquence but on his knowledge of names—in other
words, nouns par excellence. Knowledge of totemic names belonging to a clan (and of their
‘shadowy’ equivalents: see §22.3) plays a role for both men and women when it comes to songs.
Laments of foiled marriages, namay and sui, are sung by both men and women. The mourning
songs gra-kudi (cry-language) are the prerogative of women. The quality of a song and the
proﬁciency of a singer are judged by the richness of totemic names associated with the clan of
the deceased. Such proﬁciency in a woman is comparable to the eloquence of a male orator
in name debates—except that a good orator wins at a debate (and his clan acquires a name),
while singing a mourning song does not result in winning anything, except prestige and respect.
Multiple ‘names’—each belonging to a diﬀerent clan—create a situation of multiple synonymy
(see §21.5), mostly for nouns.
   The Manambu lexicon is large—especially where nouns are concerned. Very precise distinc-
tions can be expressed. On the other hand, there is a high degree of ‘generality’—one always
has the option of using a generic noun or a generic verb if for some reason one chooses to do
so. This is reminiscent of the organization of Manambu discourse: at the end of the preceding
chapter we saw a curious combination of both explicitness and ellipsis. Manambu also has
a large number of homonyms (partly resulting from a variety of phonological mergers in its
history). A view from other Ndu languages may sometimes help—we return to this in §22.1.
   We start with a discussion of a number of prominent semantic subclasses of verbs (§21.1).
We then turn to the problem of generic, and speciﬁc, notions in the Manambu lexicon (§21.2).
A general noun and a general verb meaning ‘whatever’ and ‘do whatever’ respectively are dis-
cussed in §21.3. Body part constructions and the expression of emotions are discussed in §21.4
(see §17.4 and §20.1.4 for grammatical relations in body part constructions). Their semantics is
discussed in §21.4. In §21.5, we address speech formulae, especially the ways of addressing and
farewelling each other, and touch upon multiple synonyms and name ownership.
                                   21.1 v e r b s e m a n t i c sRoughly the same set of semantic distinctions is coded in the verbal lexicons of all the languages
of the world. Language-speciﬁc concepts tend to include items relating to beliefs, cultural
552     21 Issues in Semantics and Features of Lexiconpractices, and social organization. The range of meanings of a lexeme can be expected to
vary from language to language. In this section, we brieﬂy summarize a few of the semantic
subclasses of Manambu verbs which appear to be cross-linguistically unusual.
  One such instance in Manambu is ingestive verbs, to do with consuming food or drink—
see §21.1.1. Verbs of perception display rather unusual patterns of polysemy, and may be
considered a special semantico-grammatical subclass within the verbal lexicon—see §21.1.2.
Verbs of speech, one of which was discussed at some length in §19.5, show an interesting
distribution and a number of cross-linguistically unusual diﬀerences one from another—see
§21.1.3.","[573, 574, 575, 576, 577, 578, 579]"
"   Such ﬁne-grained distinctions in temporal relationships between clauses are characteristic
of other Ndu languages, such as Iatmul (see Staalsen 1972) and Ambulas (Wilson 1980: 72–4;
also see Roberts 1988, 1997).
   The only switch-reference-sensitive medial markers which form a same-subject/diﬀerent-
subject pair are the completive markers -ku and -k. Other markers do not have paired forms,
similarly to Iatmul and to Ambulas. The cotemporaneous and the immediate sequence marker
require that the subject of the clause they mark be the same as that of the subsequent clause.
This requirement may be understood as a consequence of topical continuity of same-subject
participants in such situations.
   In contrast, the markers with the meaning ‘as soon as (little temporal overlap)’ and ‘same
time as: consecutive overlap’ do not have the topical continuity requirement. Consequently,
their subjects do not have to be the same as those of a following clause.
   We will now discuss the semantics and the properties of each of the medial clause types one
at a time. Medial clauses can be embedded within one another and form a clause chain—this
is addressed in §18.10. In each section, dependent verb forms under discussion are underlined.                                   18.2 s equencing -nThe sequencing medial clause marker -n is the most general of all medial clause markers,
in terms of its semantics and usage. It indicates that the action of the dependent clause is
simultaneous with that of an adjacent or a main clause, or shows a signiﬁcant degree of
temporal overlap with it. In 18.1, the event of the clause marked with -n is simultaneous with
the main clause: as one road goes oﬀ to the left, another comes in on the right.
                                                                   18.2 Sequencing -n       44918.1 [nak aki-taba:r          væki:n]       [nak mapa-taba:r

     værad]
     come.in+3masc.sgbas.p
     ‘One (road) going oﬀ to the left, one comes in on the right’  In 18.2, the actions of the clauses marked with -n are simultaneous; they signiﬁcantly overlap
with the action of a subsequent clause, marked with the completive -k:18.2 [yi-ku],       [a-d@               na:gw {yaku-n yaku-n yaku-n}] [karya-n]
     go-compl.ss dem.dist-masc.sg sago wash-seq wash-seq wash-seq bring-seq
     [væk-a:m       væs@-br@-k]            [t@-d@-k],             [ata
     pot-lk+loc store-3du-compl.ds stand-3masc.sg-compl.ds then
     wa-br@-d]
     say-3dusubj.p-3masc.sgbas.p
     ‘Having gone, as they washed-washed-washed that sago, as they brought (it), having
     stored it in a pot, it having stayed, then they said to him’   Repetition of the verb yaku- ‘wash’ marked with -n in 18.2 iconically reﬂects repetition of
the action (see §12.8.3, and examples there). The three occurrences of yaku-n are pronounced
as one intonation unit and belong to the same clause—this is why they are in curly brackets
(similar examples are at 12.77–9). No other medial verb form can undergo such repetition.
   In 18.2, the subject of the simultaneous clause marked with -n is the same as that of the
subsequent clause (marked with the completive -k). Not so in 18.3. In the third clause, the
sequential form with -n is repeated four times. There is an intonation break between the second
and the third clause which is indicative of a clause boundary. The vowel of the verb in the
second clause is lengthened, iconically reﬂecting the distance to be travelled:18.3 [an     yi-k@-ta                           aka],                      [yi:n], [yi-n

     yi-n     yi-n    yi-n], [ñ@d-@-yab@m              yab@-bra               viti]
     go-seq go-seq go-seq middle-lk-road+lk+loc road+lk-3dunom+lk two
     ‘This is how we two will go, as (we) go, as (we) go-go-go-go, in the middle of the road
     there are two roads’   As can be seen from 18.3 and numerous other examples, ‘simultaneity’ of the dependent
clause is only one of the meanings of the sequencing suﬃx -n. Its general implication is that
the event was concomitant to some other event—as in 18.3 where the characters were not
necessarily walking simultaneously with the two roads appearing in front of them. Similar
examples of concomitant events are at 14.105 and 14.109 (where the dependent clause follows
the main clause), and T1.33. In 14.110, the second clause marked with -n has additional
overtones of reason (‘since/as/while you did not come or were not coming’).
   Clauses marked with -n often reﬂect sequence of actions, as in 18.4—a suggestion by Tanina
that she should, as always, take my microphone down the stairs and put it down in the sun, so
that its solar panel could be recharged:18.4 [kar-da-n]         [taka-u]
     bring-down-seq put.down-1sgimpv
     ‘Shall I take it down(stairs) and put it down?’
450     18 Clause Linking and Dependent Clauses  Here, the action of the dependent clause clearly has to precede that of the main clause. The
two form a closely knit sequence. A dependent clause marked with -n can refer to a process
which leads up to the result stated in the main clause, as in 18.5:
18.5 [wun war@-n] ñ@n-a-p@k                  t@-k-na-wun
     I       go.up-seq you.fem-lk-like become-fut-act.foc-1fem.sgbas.vt
     ‘I will grow to be like you’ (lit. I going up will be like you)
  Similar examples are 16.22, 18.6, and 16.19. All of these have an additional implication of
manner. Example 16.22 was an instruction to the little girl to drink water from a cup, and
not straight from the bucket where the water was stored. Example 18.6 refers to the way of
obtaining food.
18.6 [kamna:gw yapi:n] [k@-kwa-d]
     food        buy+seq eat-impv.3p-masc.sg
     ‘May he eat having bought/buying food’ or ‘May he eat through buying food (rather than
     growing his own)’
   A one-word clause marked with -n is akin to an adverbial modiﬁer. In 18.7, the dependent
clause can be translated as ‘being hidden’, or ‘in a secret way’.
18.7 [d@ pakw@-n]       k@-k@r
     he be.hidden-seq eat-des
     ‘He wanted to eat (stolen food) being hidden (himself)’ (or ‘in a secret way’)
  The -n marked forms of positional and motion verbs are often used to modify other verbs in
adjacent clauses, as in 18.8: here, the sequencing form of the verb s@b@n- ‘return, come back’
means ‘back’. A similar example is in the penultimate line of T2.40.
18.8 s@b@n@-n        ak@s       kui-kwa-na
     come.back-seq neg.hab give.to.third.p-hab-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt
     ‘She never gives (things) back’
  Along similar lines, yi:n (go+seq) in 18.9 does not involve going anywhere—the meaning of
this form is ‘on and on’, and it is used to describe continuous crying for the drowned boy.
18.9 [gra-n gra-n napa-ku]                  [ga:m      s@-d@ka     s@-d@ka],
     cry-seq cry-seq compl.vb-compl.ss shouting plant-only plant-only
     [a               fondey-a       ñ@ yi:n,       ga:n kus@m]
     dem.dist.fem.sg Thursday-lk day go+seq night ﬁnish+compl
     ‘(We) having cried and cried, calling only, that Thursday. (As we went crying and calling)
     on and on, the night ﬁnished’
   These forms are being reinterpreted as adverbs; we return to the grammaticalization and
reinterpretation of medial verbs in §19.9.
   Speakers of Manambu tend to oﬀer sequencing forms marked with -n as citation forms of
verbs, e.g. væs@-n (step-seq) ‘to step’, væs kap@-n (grass cut-seq) ‘to cut grass’. These forms can
be used as S in verbless clauses, as in 18.10a–b, and 15.20:
18.10a [gu    tu:n            s@kul@k yi:n]      samasama yawi-a
       water fetch.water+seq cooking go+seq a.lot+lk job-3fem.sgnom
       ‘Fetching water and cooking is a lot of work’
                                                                     18.2 Sequencing -n       45118.10b [wiyugw saku-n]             aka-n-aka
       door       push.outside-seq react.top.dem.dist.fem.sg-pred-react.top.fem.sg
       ‘This is how is (done) opening (lit. pushing outside) a (traditional) door’
   Or they can head the predicate of a verbless clause, and take the appropriate nominal cross-
referencing:
18.11a væs kap@-n-a
       grass cut-seq-3fem.sgnom
       ‘This (activity) is cutting grass’
  A similar example in negative polarity is at 18.11b:
18.11b na:gw kur@n k@                      tami: ma:
       sago get+seq dem.prox.fem.sg area neg
       ‘There is no place to get sago in this area’
  They can also mark clausal complements of a transitive verb (as in 18.12) or of a ditransitive
verb (18.13) (see §19.8):
18.12 [ [a             ja:p kur@-n] ma: wa-k@-bra]                             [aw agwa
      dem.dist.fem.sg thing do-seq no say-fut-3dusubj.vt+3fem.sgbas.vt then which
      jap     k@-b@r-k@k@k]
      (thing) eat-3du-purp.ds
      ‘Then if they would refuse doing this thing, then what are they to eat?’
18.13 [family kulapu-n]      [vyakanaku-n] atawa skul
      family keep.tidy-seq improve-seq       thus school
      kui-yikwa-lwun
      give.to.third.p-hab.p-1fem.sgbas.p
      ‘Keeping the family tidy, improving (things), thus I taught (them to do)’ (lit. gave school)
  Sequencing forms marked with -n can be used on a par with noun phrases, similarly to action
nominalization. An example is at 18.14.
18.14 [kur-ma:r-k@-bra-di                  yawi adiya]                     [ñapwi
      do-neg-fut-3dusubj.vt-3plbas.vt work dem.dist.react.top+pl ﬁrewood
      m@wi             yi-n    kur-@n karya-n] [gu        m@wi              tu:n
      things.like.that go-seq get-seq bring-seq water things.like.that fetch.water+seq
      wiya:r            kawar@-n]    [k@ jap atawa akw@r]
      house+lk+all carry.up-seq this thing thus impv+do
      ‘The work they won’t do, things like going getting carrying ﬁrewood and things like that,
      fetching water (and) carrying it up to the house and things like that, do these things! (she
      usually kept telling them)’
  The sequencing forms are not really noun-like in any other way. Unlike action nomi-
nalizations (see §9.1.1), the sequencing forms cannot take any cases, be part of an NP, or
occur with modiﬁers. And we can recall, from §17.1.1, that the sequential form -n is also
used in aspectual complex predicates. This is also the citation form (cf. 16.108). There is no
doubt that it is a verbal form, and the most polyfunctional of all medial verb forms in the
language. As it occurs in a wide variety of contexts, it can be considered the least functionally
marked.
452     18 Clause Linking and Dependent Clauses       18.3 c o m p l e t i v e - k u ‘ s a m e s u b j e c t ’/ -k ‘ different subject ’The completive medial markers -ku/k indicate that the action of the dependent clause was fully
completed before the start of the action of an adjacent or a main clause. An example of same
subject in the dependent and the main clause is at 18.15, and of diﬀerent subject at 18.16.
18.15 [vya-ku]      [k@-k@-bana-b@r]
      kill-compl.ss eat-fut-1plsubj.vt-3dubas.vt
      ‘Having killed (them) we will eat them two’
18.16 [ata wa-tu@-k]             [k@-di         ñan-ugw asa:y ata wa:d]
      thus say-1sg-compl.ds dem.prox-pl child-pl father thus say+3masc.sgbas.p
      ‘After I’d said thus, the father of these children said thus’
   The use of same or diﬀerent subject is frequently triggered by an adjacent clause which may
itself be a dependent clause. An example is at 18.17. Switch-reference in clause chaining helps
keep track of who did what to whom—this is especially important in the case of third person
participants. The subject of the ﬁrst clause in 18.17 is the same as that of the second clause. But
the subject of the main clause is diﬀerent from that of the following clause which happens to
be the main clause.
18.17 [d@-k@-d@        ñan gu       k@-ku]              [kiya-d@-k]            [ata
      he-poss-masc.sg child water consume-compl.ss die-3masc.sg-compl.ds then

      cry+3masc.sgbas.p
      ‘After/because hisi sonj had died after/because hej drowned (lit. consumed water) hei
      (father) cried’
  This example highlights the inherent ambiguity of the completive medial clauses—they may
express temporal sequence and also reason. The completive verb construction is used as a
means of disambiguation—see §18.9.
  A chain of clauses with subject change is often much longer than this. Example 18.18 is a
rather typical lengthy clause chain. Further examples include T2.4–5 and T2.13–17.
18.18 [ata a-di          m@d        day-a-di m@d-a             sap kay-puti-ku]

      they (the skins) stayed (there), after they (cassowaries) then having turned into real
      women, they (cassowaries) stood (there)’
   A dependent medial clause can be postposed to the main clause, as is the second clause in
18.19. This clause has the same subject as the main clause, and forms one intonation unit with
it. We return to this later on in this section. A pause separates second and third clause. Note
that the subject of the third clause is the same as that of the subsequent, fourth, clause.

      on top of the bench, he sat (there)]’
  That is, switch-reference is a powerful means for tracking referents (see Roberts 1988, 1997).
Further examples of diﬀerent-subject completive are at 7.1, 7.72, 17.31, and 19.31, and of
same-subject completive are at 7.18, 7.21, 7.28, 14.111, 14.142, 17.28, and 19.3. Examples 17.4,
T2.4–5, and T2.13–18 illustrate lengthy clause chains where the subject change is marked with
switch-reference-sensitive suﬃxes.
  If a clause marked as same subject is followed by another clause also marked as same subject
this implies that there is no subject change, as in 18.20.
18.20 [ [s@r     yi-k@-bana]                       wa-ku]         [val  kur-ku]

      [adiya                  yi-di]
      dem.dist.react.top+pl go-3plbas.p
      ‘Having said: “We will go tomorrow”, having got the canoe, they went’
  In contrast, if two clauses—each carrying diﬀerent-subject completive marker and identical
person markers—are consecutive, the subject does not have to change. This is in fact a means
of linking two dependent completive clauses. Consider 18.18 above: second clause ‘after they
put’ and third clause ‘after they’d stayed (that way)’ are both marked for diﬀerent subject
because their subjects are diﬀerent from that of the following clause ‘having changed into’.
This is particularly obvious if the same clause is repeated, either slightly rephrased, as in 18.21,
or verbatim, as in T3.37.
18.21 [kar-da-n]         [taka-d@-k               ya:m],         [numa-d@      ya:m

      put-3masc.sg-compl.ds village-lk man-woman then say-3plbas.p
      ‘After he’d put (the snake) into the ﬁre bringing it down, after he put (it) into a big ﬁre,
      village people then said (“What a big snake!”)’
   The second clause of 18.21 is an infrequent example of a non-verb-ﬁnal order in a medial
dependent clause.
   In contrast, a sequence of two clauses each marked for diﬀerent person of diﬀerent subjects
implies that the subjects are indeed diﬀerent, as in 17.4 (second and third clauses). Alterna-
tively, if the cross-referencing is the same, but participants are diﬀerent, at least one of them
tends to be stated with an overt NP. In T3.37, the main character, a woman, is the subject
of the ﬁrst clause—hence the feminine singular cross-referencing. The subject of the third
clause is diﬀerent from that of the ﬁrst clause, but, since night is feminine (see §5.2), it also
requires feminine cross-referencing. To indicate that the two ‘feminine’ participants—‘night’
and ‘woman’—are diﬀerent, ‘night’ is overtly stated.
   We will see, in §20.4.2, that a clause chain can be interrupted by ya:kya or ya:k ‘all right,
OK’ whose major function is to indicate that a certain time has elapsed between the actions of
the two adjacent clauses. Such interruption also allows the speaker to regain their breath.
   Just as in many languages with switch-reference, establishing what counts as same and as
diﬀerent subject is not always straightforward. If the subject of the ﬁrst clause is part of a
(non-singular) subject of the subsequent clause, the two subjects tend to be treated as same. In
454     18 Clause Linking and Dependent Clauses18.22, the subject of the ﬁrst clause is the son, and the subject of the third, ﬁnal clause is the
son and his mother. The medial dependent clauses are marked for same subject.
18.22 [d@-a:b-a             kamna:gw k@-ku]                 [d@-ab-a             gu

      ‘After he (son: not anyone else) too had eaten food, after he (son: not anyone else) too
      had drunk water, they two (son and mother) then stayed (there)’
   Not so in T2.13: Sesawi who had struck the slit gong was among those Avatip men who got
together and went oﬀ to ﬁght the Gala hiding on top of a tree. Yet his association with his
fellow villagers was not as close as that of a mother and a son; hence diﬀerent-subject marking.
   Two quite diﬀerent referents may acquire same-subject marking if they take part in a closely
knit event (see Reesink 1983, on similar phenomena in other Papuan languages). In 18.23, the
subjects of the second and the third clause are diﬀerent—yet they are marked as if they were
the same since the sub-events happened almost simultaneously, and the second clause was the
direct reason for the third clause: the narrator looked around scared as she had heard the sound
of something exploding:
18.23 [ar waku-n]       [pou                na-ku],          [wun

      ‘Going out to the lake, noise of explosion having occurred, I having looked across away
      (to see what’s happening), then said’
   We can recall, from §17.4 (especially example 17.60) that body part constructions expressing
feelings or states within dependent clauses require diﬀerent-subject cross-referencing even
though the experiencer is the same person. Once in a dependent clause, the experiencer is
backgrounded, and not cross-referenced on the verb of feeling. A diﬀerent-subject sequencing
marker is then required. A typical example is at 18.24—the same people felt thirsty, went down
to the lake, and drank water:
18.24 [gu    yasa-l@-k],                      [a-d@              gu    ata da-ku]

      ‘Having felt thirsty (lit. after water felt), having descended onto water, having done so,
      they two drank it sitting’
  However, body part constructions can be treated as containing the same subject in terms of
switch-reference, if the subject is highly topical, as is the pronominal subject wun in 18.25:
18.25 [wun ya-tua-l-a]                                      [wun-a       ta:kw atawa bap

      ‘It is the case that I have come, because my wife saw the moon (that is, menstruated),
      this is why having become angry (lit. belly having cried), I am coming’
                                18.3 Completive -ku ‘same subject’/-k ‘diﬀerent subject’         455   In 18.26, m@l ‘eye’ appears in a body part construction with puk@-puk puk@-puk ‘bulge and
bulge’ (see §12.8.3, on the function and meaning of repetition here). The character, who had
been hiding in a hollow sago tree, is the topic of this stretch of discourse: he had just been
found by an enemy, and is asking the enemy to kill him straight away (this is from a diﬀerent
version of Text 2, told by another speaker). The reactivated topic marker ad@ka in the third
clause refers to the topical participant, the subject of ‘say’:
18.26 [m@l puk@-puk puk@-puk na-ku]                     [wa-ku],
      eye bulge-red bulge-red be:nat-compl.ss say-compl.ss
      [ad@ka                          wa:d],                 [wun-a:m        avi        ya],

      ‘His eyes bulging out, (he) saying, he (topical) said: “Kill me, after you’d hit me to death
      may I die”. He, “that?” ’ (meaning: no way)’
   The completive dependent clause has here an additional, recapitulative, function. The same-
subject completive form of the dependent verb appears after the main verb, forming one
intonation unit with it, indicating the completion of the action of the main verb. Such com-
pletive dependent forms never express causal meanings. An example is at 18.27. Curly brackets
indicate that the inﬂected verb in the main clause forms one intonation unit with the verb in
the following same-subject dependent clause.
18.27 [t@-d@-k],                  [kula:r a-d@              na:gw ata
      stand-3masc.sg-compl.ds axe         dem.dist-masc.sg sago then

      [waku-d@-l]
      go.out-3masc.sgsubj.p-3fem.sgbas.p
      ‘After he (Kamkudi) had been (there), after he (Sesawi) completed splitting that sago
      (tree) open (lit. hit open—having hit open), he (Kamkudi) went out (of the sago tree) at
      that (time)’
   A similar example is at the penultimate clause of T2.40 (kur-ku yi-ku get-compl.ss go-
compl.ss). We will see, at §19.5, that such recapitulating constructions are particularly frequent
with speech reports, e.g. wa-tua wa-ku (say-1sgsubj.vt+3fem.sgbas.vt say-compl.ss) ‘I said’ (lit.
I said saying) (e.g. 19.74). One additional function of this repetition is to stress that a speech
act actually took place: speech reports in Manambu are used in a wide variety of meanings not
all of which involve a speech act.
   Alternatively, the same-subject form of the verb t@- ‘stand, be’ can be used in the meaning
of ‘after that’, literally, ‘having been (like that)’. This form often follows a dependent clause, as
in second and third clauses in 18.24—note that the sequence of verbs {da-ku t@-ku} (go.down-
compl.ss stand-compl.ss) are pronounced as one intonation group. A similar example is at
18.28: the recapitulating t@-ku occurs twice:
18.28 [atawa war@-d                yawi] [a-di       yawi {war-ku]

      concerned, these people from the Maliau clan cut and carried (sago) down up until
      here’
   The form t@-ku operates almost like a connective ‘thus, and so’. We will see, in §19.6, that
this form is indeed in the process of grammaticalizing as part of a connective: al@k t@-ku
(dem.dist.fem.sg+dat stand-compl.ss) is used as a clause linker meaning ‘and so, as a result’.
It is pronounced as one phonological word.
              18.4 c o t e m p o ra n e o u s c lau s e m a r k e d w i t h -ta:yCotemporaneous clauses indicate the action of the dependent clause which started before that
of an adjacent or a main clause and overlaps with it. The suﬃx -ta:y could be related to the
adverb ta:y ‘before’ (§4.4).
  A dependent clause marked with -ta:y in 18.29 describes an action which started before that
of the main clause, and continued after the action of the main clause had started, overlapping
with it:
18.29 [k@-ta:y]   [wa-na-b@r]
      eat-cotemp say-act.foc-3dubas.vt
      ‘They two talk while eating’ (they started eating before they started talking)
  Yuaneng instructed Benji to put on a shirt we’d just given him as a present, and to come
back to show us:

      ‘You will come (to us) having put (the shirt) on and wearing it’
   The ancestors of the Makem clan have been killing ﬁsh and eating it on their own without
telling their relatives from Avatip. The killing of the ﬁsh has obviously started prior to them
not telling the other lot about it (ﬁrst clause of 18.31a). In 18.31b (which follows 18.31a in the
same story), killing ﬁsh had started before ‘eating on their own’; the eﬀect of -ta:y in the ﬁrst
clause is that they kept killing and eating the ﬁsh:
18.31a [k@-di        Mak@m           d@y-a-d@        warag-a-du

                                        18.4 Cotemporaneous clause marked with -ta:y         45718.31b [d@y vya-ta:y]     kap@-ka:p          k@-da-l

       ‘Killing ﬁsh they ate it (ﬁsh) on their own’
It is instructive to compare the three medial clause types we have discussed so far, in terms of
their semantics—which is not always easy to render in a translation into English (let alone Tok
Pisin).
   We can recall, from 18.7, that [d@ pakw@-n] k@-k@r (he be.hidden-seq eat-des) means ‘He
wanted to eat (stolen food) being hidden (himself)’ (or ‘in a secret way’). If a completive form
is used, [d@ pakw@-ku] k@-k@r (he be.hidden-compl.ss eat-des) would mean ‘He wanted to eat
(stolen food) after having hidden (himself)’. With a cotemporaneous form, the meaning would
be subtly diﬀerent again: [d@ pakw@-ta:y] k@-k@r (he be.hidden-cotemp eat-des) means ‘He
wanted to eat (stolen food) having been hidden (before he ate, or before he expressed his desire)
and staying hidden while eating’.
   With an example like 18.32a–b, the diﬀerence is rather more illustrative (compare 18.8):
18.32a s@b@n-ku            ak@s       kui-kwa-na
       come.back-compl.ss neg.hab give.to.third.p-hab-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt
       ‘Having come back she never gives (things)’
18.32b s@b@n-ta:y      ak@s      kui-kwa-na
       come.back-seq neg.hab give.to.third.p-hab-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt
       ‘As she is coming back, she never gives (things)’
  The cotemporaneous -ta:y has an overtone of action or state stretching over time, as in
14.114, 12.37, and T3.43. Two clauses marked with -ta:y can be juxtaposed, with a sequential
eﬀect, as in 18.33. This is a description of the way of life of the Manambu people hiding in the
bush during the Japanese occupation of Avatip:
18.33 [m@y-a s@      ma: ku]           [amay-b@r      s@kul@k yi-da-k@r@b]

      then+say-cotemp stay-do.incessantly-1plbas.p
      ‘(We) did not really sleep. As mothers were cooking, every night going down taking us
      they would take us to the bush (to hide)’
  The verb or a sequence of verbs each marked with -ta:y can be repeated to describe an
action that goes on and on, as in 18.34, and T1.29. This is congruent with the general meaning
of repetition (see §12.8.3).
18.34 [ñ@n-a-di       ñan-ugw aw wun k@d@ka                                    {vya-ta:y]

      ‘Your children I will eat, killing-eating killing-eating’ (said the man taunting a snake)
  A sequence of verbs marked with -ta:y in 18.34 is pronounced as one intonation group
(marked with curly brackets). This is reﬂected in the English translation with a dash
458     18 Clause Linking and Dependent Clauses(killing-eating) These verbs share not only the subject, but other arguments as well. Such
juxtaposed clauses form a clause union, similarly to above.
  Repeated cotemporaneous forms are often used as the only predicates in a clause (see §19.9
on desubordination). The semantic eﬀect is that of an action which keeps repeating itself, as in
4.33—a comment on me getting things and giving them away. Similarly, Celestin commented
on my habit of washing my teeth every time I ate anything:
18.35 {k@-ta:y    jan-ta:y}           {k@-ta:y jan-ta:y}
      eat-cotemp wash(part)-cotemp eat-cotemp wash(part)-cotemp
      ‘Eating-washing eating-washing’
   This is an example of a desubordinated clause—a dependent clause used on its own.
   Just like the same-subject completive form, the cotemporaneous form may have a recapitu-
lating function, adding the meaning of ‘keeping on and on’ to the main clause. Then, the same
verb as that of the main clause occurs in the cotemporaneous form postposed to it, forming
one intonation group with it (as in 4.33 ‘getting and giving’).
   Cotemporaneous forms can, just occasionally, head the predicate, taking the nominal cross-
referencing—just like a sequential -n (example 18.11a). The meaning is that of repetitive action.
18.36 gu    tu-ta:y-ad
      water fetch-cotemp-3masc.sgnom
      ‘He kept fetching water’
   Alternatively, one or several cotemporaneous dependent verbs can be used with t@- ‘stand’
as support verb. The meaning is that of an action that started before the moment of speech
and keeps going on and on. In 18.37, such a construction with four dependent verbs occurs
in a main clause, and in 18.38 it is used in a dependent completive medial clause. They
share all arguments. In terms of their intonation, they do not diﬀer from other -ta:y-marked
clauses.

      sago wash-cotemp stand-compl.ss look.across.away see-1sgsubj.p-3plbas.p
      ‘As I had been washing sago on and on across there on an island, I looked across here’
   As mentioned in §17.5, such structures can be analysed as complex predicates with a repet-
itive meaning whose action had started before the speech act. Their meaning is much more
straightforward than that of aspectual complex predicates (§17.1.1): the anterior, durative, or
prolonged durative meaning of the aspectual complex predicates arises from putting together
the -n-marked verb form accompanied by the appropriate auxiliary. In contrast, the repetitive
meaning of 18.37–8 is inherent to the cotemporaneous form.
   If the position, or duration of action, is to be speciﬁed, another positional verb can be used
as a support verb with a cotemporaneous form, e.g. r @- ‘sit’ as in 18.39 where the character is
in a sitting position.
                                    18.5 Immediate sequence clause marked with -taka          45918.39 [na:gw sau-ta:y]       [r@-na]
      sago fry-cotemp sit-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt
      ‘She is sitting frying sago on and on’ (she had started frying sago before the moment of
      the narrative)
   Examples 18.37–9 illustrate dependent verb forms heading a predicate and requiring a
support verb—just like any uninﬂected verb form would, if used in a dependent clause, or
if person, number, gender, and tense speciﬁcations are required.
   Similarly to the same-subject completive forms, cotemporaneous forms may become gram-
maticalized. The form wa-ta:y (say-cotemp) ‘that way; lit. having been saying’ is a case in point.
In 18.40, wa-ta:y has nothing to do with any speech act; just like t@ku ‘thus’ discussed at the
end of §18.3, it operates as a connective:
18.40 [ata r@-ta:y]          [k@-ta:y]   [ata wa-ta:y       tabu-dian]
      then sit/live-cotemp eat-cotemp then say-cotemp escape-1plbas.p
      ‘Then living (and) eating, that way we escaped (the Japanese)’
  Similar examples are at 12.59 and 18.33. The form ata wa-ta:y is often pronounced as one
word—see §19.6. This grammaticalization path is not surprising given the frequency and the
breadth of meaning of the verb wa- ‘say’—we return to this in §19.5.
            18.5 i m m e d i at e s e q u e n c e c laus e m a r k e d w i t h -takaThe medial clause suﬃx -taka is one of the four suﬃxes which are sensitive to the syllable
weight of the root and trigger iambic stress pattern (§2.4.2). The suﬃx has two allomorphs:
-taka with heavy roots and -ta-taka with light (CV) roots. This suﬃx requires the same subject
as the main clause. It indicates that the action of the dependent clause has been completed
and is immediately followed by that of an adjacent clause. In 18.41, the sorcerer opened the
stringbag with the baby in it the very moment he got hold of the bag. This idea of the ‘very
moment’ is captured by -taka:
18.41 [d@ a-d@              du yata-taka]         [wa:r      ada
      he dem.dist-masc.sg man carry-imm.seq string.bag dem.dist.react.top+masc.sg
      kaja-saki-ku]                                  [ketad

      v@-d@-d]
      look-3masc.sgsubj.p-3masc.sgbas.p
      ‘The man opened the stringbag he had carried and looked down into it’ (lit. ‘he that man
      immediately on carrying (the stringbag) having opened the stringbag by moving the sides
      apart, looked down (into the bag) (and put a spell onto the baby that was inside)’
Other examples are at 18.19, 16.19, and 16.29. A clause marked with -taka can be postposed to
the main clause, as in 14.115.
   Just as with the completive same-subject clauses (e.g. 18.20), a sequence of -taka clauses
share their subjects. An example is in T1.3.
   A -taka clause which is postposed to the main clause and contains the same verb as the main
clause has a recapitulative function, as in 18.42. The two verbs form one intonation unit, and
there is no intonation break between them. This is similar to the behaviour of a same-subject
completive clause (see 18.27).
460     18 Clause Linking and Dependent Clauses18.42 [yi-n, yi-n, yi-n, ñ@d-@-yab@r                 ata {waku-di],

      out’
Unlike cotemporaneous clauses and sequencing clauses marked with -n, -taka clauses cannot
head a predicate. They hardly ever occur desubordinated (that is, without a main clause), and
are much less frequent in texts and conversations than medial clauses of other types.
          18.6 t e m p o ra l ov e r la p m a r k e d w i t h - k@b ‘ a s s o o n a s’The medial clause suﬃx -k@b is sensitive to the syllable weight of the root, and triggers the
iambic stress pattern (§2.4.2). The suﬃx has two allomorphs: -k@b with heavy roots and -k@-
k@b with light (CV) roots. A variant of -k@-k@b is -k@r@b (see A3 at §2.6). This suﬃx requires
diﬀerent subject; consequently the resulting verb is partially inﬂected. It indicates that the
action of the dependent clause is immediately followed by that of an adjacent or a main clause,
with a possible short temporal overlap between the two. In 18.43, as the Gala people were
eating ﬁsh (ﬁrst clause), as soon as the Avatip people had approached them (second clause,
marked with -k@b), the Gala started carefully putting together pieces of limbum palm leaves
(to hide the ﬁsh), and gave the Avatip people just coconuts to eat:
18.43 [k@-ta:y],    [Apat@p du væki-da-k@b],                [r@ka:r@k bæy

      ‘As they were eating, as soon as the Avatip men came across, they having carefully joined
      (pieces) of limbum (to hide the ﬁsh), gave them nothing but coconuts’
  A similar example is at T2.15: after the Avatip people had come (to ﬁght the Gala fugitives
hiding on top of the tree), as soon as the Avatip people cut the tree (marked with -k@k@b), while
the Gala people were throwing spears down from the tree, they (the Gala people) hit the shields
of the Avatip men. Further examples are at 10.59, 12.80, and 16.78.
  Adjacent clauses marked with -k@b may have diﬀerent subjects, if the verbs are next to each
other as in 18.44 (clauses 4 and 5), or same subjects (as in clauses 5 and 6) if they are not.

      get them, little children from every area having been staying in their own village area,
      usually play (with these seeds)’
  Only if adjacent clauses contain the same verb, as in 18.44, are the subjects the same. Note
that they have to be diﬀerent from those of the next clause. The constituent in slashes / / in the
ﬁrst clause in 18.45 is a complex predicate with a prolonged durative meaning (§17.1.1).
18.45 [ñan-a t@p-a:m           walimaudi /waku-n        kwa-d@-k@k@b/]

      ja-s@k@r
      fall-time
      ‘In our village as soon as the Rainbow keeps coming out and stays in the sky, that is the
      time of rain’
   This is similar to the behaviour of the diﬀerent-subject completive -k in adjacent clauses:
18.43 is similar to 18.18, and 18.44 is reminiscent of 18.21.
   Unlike other medial clause markers, -k@b can combine with -ta:y ‘cotemporaneous’. The
sequence -ta:y-k@b and its variant -ta:y-k@r@b (always in this order) has the same subject as the
following clause, and refers to the action that started before the action of the following clause
and overlaps with it. The subject is the same, because -ta:y is the same-subject marker:
18.46 [abakapi wuka                                da-ta:y-k@r@b]             [ñan-ugw

      dem.prox.addr.react.top.pl eat-3fem.sgsubj.vt-3plbas.vt
      ‘The hawk as soon as she has descended here (close to you: she’d started descending
      before the moment of narrative), ate up the children (of the chicken)’
  A similar example is in T3.8. The medial verb forms marked with -k@b can head a predicate,
as shown in 18.47.
18.47 n@k@            k@k@pa:t n@k@           k@k@pa:t

      give.to.third.p-3masc.sg-as.soon.as-3masc.sgnom
      ‘(This was) as soon as he’d given (them) various sorts of foodstuﬀ’
  This is the only circumstance when it occurs desubordinated.
                     18.7 c aus a l c lau s e s m a r k e d w i t h -l@kThe predicate of causal clauses takes the suﬃx -l@k which is not switch-reference sensitive.
This suﬃx is a product of recent grammaticalization of the (functionally unmarked) distal
demonstrative feminine dative a-l-@k ‘for that feminine’. We can recall, from §7.4, that causal
meaning is congruent with the meaning of the dative case. The form al@k ‘this is why’ is also
used as a clausal connective (see §19.6).
  The causal medial forms diﬀer from all other medial forms. They can be considered fully
inﬂected, because they occur with main clause tensed subject cross-referencing for A/S (see
462     18 Clause Linking and Dependent ClausesTable 11.2). However, unlike the inﬂected verbs in main clauses, no second argument can be
cross-referenced. Alternatively, the lack of second argument cross-referencing can be under-
stood as Ø-cross-referencing which corresponds to feminine singular basic non-subject. This
agrees with the functionally unmarked character of the feminine singular choice.
   This is understandable, from a historical perspective: the second position after the tensed
subject cross-referencing is ‘occupied’ by the ‘reason’ marking. We can conceive of the Ø-cross-
referencing as reﬂecting the ‘reason’.
   Unlike other medial clauses, dependent causal clauses can contain verbs marked with the
habitual aspect (as in T1.24), and with the action focus, as in 18.48.
18.48 [wañ wuli-yi-n         kwa-na-l@k]                             [wun-a

      ‘Because the (genealogical) line keeps getting bigger and bigger, I say about my land “It

  Some speakers use non-tensed subject markers—rather than tensed ones—in causal clauses,
thus making them more similar to other dependent clauses. An example is at 14.116—Kulanawi
said kwar-ma:r-tu-l@k (get.neg-neg.dep-1sg-‘because) ‘because I did not get (a letter)’ using
the non-tensed form -tu- rather than -tua (subj.vt) or -tu@ (subj.p). This is in contrast to 18.49
where a more frequent tensed form is used.
18.49 [wun ga:n s@k@r yawi kur-tua-l@k],                   [al@k       wun ña        s@k@r

      ‘Because I work at night, this is why at day time I will keep hanging on the banana palm’
      (said the ﬂying fox)
Uninﬂected verbs in causal clauses require a support verb. Causal clauses are negated with
the suﬃx -ma:r, just like all other dependent clauses—see 14.55 and 14.116 (this example
contains a causal clause postposed to the main clause). Desubordinated causal clauses are
ungrammatical.
   A causal medial clause is compatible with the connective al@k ‘this is why’ in the main
clause—as shown in 18.49. We return to clause linking involving connectives in §19.6.
                           18.8 u n l i k e ly c o n d i t i o n -ga:yA medial clause marker -ga:y, with the meaning of unlikely condition, ‘if, in an (unlikely) case’,
requires the same subject as that of the following clause and forms an uninﬂected verb. Medial
clauses marked with -ga:y take part in a construction involving the root form of the verb with
the suﬃx -ga:y followed by the same verb in whatever form is appropriate. In 18.50, it is rather
unlikely that we might have to go away; the -ga:y form is followed by future. The ﬁrst clause is
a juxtaposed dependent clause, and is marked with intonation (see §19.1):
18.50 [s@r         yi-ga:y    yi-k@-k@-bana]                          stuam

by a dependent completive medial verb marked for diﬀerent subject:18.51 [wa-su-ga:y wa-su-da-k]                [yabi:b wuk@-nak]
      call-up-cond call-up-3pl-compl.ds quickly listen/hear-1plimpv
      ‘Just in case they call up (to the house where we are), let’s quickly listen’  In 13.84, the -ga:y form is followed by a dative-aversive-marked nominalization. No other
constituent can intervene between the verb marked with -ga:y and the other verb. A -ga:y form
cannot be negated. It can be used in a negative construction: 18.52 is an example of the ‘unlikely
condition’ marker occurring in the same clause as a dependent conditional clause introduced
by the adverb k@pa:b ‘in case’ (see §13.7 and §14.5.1). We can recall, from §14.5.1 (especially
example 14.126), that such dependent conditional clauses are negated with a reduplicated
dependent clause negator -marmar-. This same negator appears in 18.52:18.52 [k@pa:b ya-ga:y         ya-marmar-@k]           al@k       samasama kamn:agw

      s@kul@k yi-tukwa
      cook      go-proh.gen
      ‘Just in case if they do not come, this is why do not cook a lot of food’   ‘Unlikely condition’ clauses are rare in all genres of texts, and in conversations. We will see
in §19.1 how other conditional meanings are expressed.                        18.9 ge n e r i c c o m p l e t i v e v e r b napa-The completive auxiliary napa- forms a complex predicate with a verb marked with the
sequencing suﬃx -n. No other constituent, including ata ‘then’, can intervene between the two
components. The order can never be reversed: clauses containing napa- are strictly verb ﬁnal.
They cannot be negated. A clause containing napa- can be postposed to the main clause (see
17.25b).
   Using the completive auxiliary is a way of emphasizing that the activity or part of it has been
ﬁnished. This strong overtone of ‘over and done with’ associated with napa- was corroborated
by the paraphrases by some consultants. When helping me transcribe a variety of Manambu
narratives, Jennie Kudapa:kw consistently rephrased all the occurrences of napa- with wapa-
‘leave, stop’. In her own speech, she used napa- and wapa- as synonyms. (A cognate could be
naap in Wosera/Ambulas, meaning ‘fall’.)
   Medial clauses containing complex predicates with the completive verb napa- have only
temporal meaning. This is in contrast to completive-marked dependent clauses (§18.3) which
may have a causal meaning: 18.53 refers to temporal sequence, and not to cause-eﬀect, while
18.17 is ambiguous. Complex predicates are in slashes.18.53 [d@-k@-d@         ñan /kiya-n napa-d@-k/]                      [s@b@n-@n

464     18 Clause Linking and Dependent Clauses   A vast majority of clauses containing napa- are marked with the completive medial clause
suﬃxes -ku (SS)/-k (DS). Further examples are at 12.81, 16.11, 16.39, 17.48, 18.9, and T2.13,
33, 35, and 37.
   Other medial clause aﬃxes—with the exception of the unlikely condition marker -ga:y
and the causal -l@k—also occur, but less frequently. In 18.54, a complex predicate with the
completive verb napa- appears in an immediate sequence clause marked with -taka: the focus
is on the completion of the action of eating food followed by washing:18.54 [a-di        kur-da-di             kamna:gw-adi] /kan            napa-taka/

      go-fut-act.foc-3plbas.p
      ‘As for those foods they brought on just having eaten them, after they’d entered the
      water, OK, they went oﬀ’   In 18.55 (a version of the story of the Gala war, similar to that in Text 2), napa- is used with
-ta:y ‘cotemporaneous’. The Gala people who were hiding on top of a tree would have got food
and eaten it down below; this process would be started and completed with some temporal
overlap with the action of climbing back up the tree, to hide:18.55 [kamna: m@wi              /kur@-n kan            napa-ta:y/]

      go.up-3plsubj.p-3plbas.p
      ‘As they have been getting food and things like that (and) eating they climbed up (the
      tree where they were hiding)’   Just like aspectual complex predicates (see the end of §17.1.1), a complex predicate with a
completive verb can contain two lexical verbs if they describe aspects of the same action, as
in 18.54. Alternatively, the lexical verb can be repeated as in 18.9. A complex predicate with
a completive verb cannot contain complex predicates of any other sort. A whole napa- clause
can never be repeated.               18.10 c laus e c h a i n i n g a n d s e n t e n c e s t ru c t u r eIn a language with extensive clause chaining a sentence contains one main clause and a series
of dependent medial clauses each of which speciﬁes relative tense with respect to the main
clause or to the adjacent clause. The resulting structure can be dauntingly lengthy and complex.
The head-tail linkage between sentences ensures coherence of the text itself, and enables the
listener to keep track of the sequence of subevents. Thus, the sub-events are presented as a
chain structure—each one connected to the next. T2.3–7 are a prime example of such a chain.
The average number of medial clauses per sentence is two to three, as in Texts 1–3. An unusually
long sentence with ﬁve medial clauses (all same subject) is in 18.56, from one of the numerous
versions of the story of Gala wars told by Walinum, a highly proﬁcient story teller.

  A lengthy chain is often interrupted by ya:kya, or its variant ya:k ‘OK, all right’, or Tok
Pisin orait, as in T2.17. We return to the use of ya:kya in §20.4.2.
        19        Other Dependent Clauses and Further
        Features of Clause LinkingWe will now discuss clause-linking devices other than clause chaining via medial dependent
clauses (see Aikhenvald forthcoming g, on their semantics). These include: juxtaposition of a
dependent clause and a main clause (§19.1); relative clauses (§19.2); clause linking via a case
marker ‘instead’ and a suﬃx ‘like’ (§19.3); purposive and desiderative clauses (§19.4); speech
reports (§19.5); clause linking involving connectives (§19.6); and juxtaposition of main clauses
(§19.7).
   Manambu does not have complement clauses as a type on their own. Some types of medial
dependent clauses, juxtaposed clauses, purposives, desideratives, speech reports, and nominal-
izations can be used as complementation strategies—see §19.8. Dependent clauses can be used
as main clauses. This phenomenon, known as desubordination, is addressed in §19.9, together
with grammaticalization and reinterpretation of ‘medial’ verbal forms.
   Table 19.1 features a comparison of dependent medial clauses, juxtaposed dependent clauses,
relative clauses, and main clauses in terms of their constituent order, predicate head possibil-
ities, and tense, aspect, and moods expressed. Relative clauses are more similar to juxtaposed
clauses than to clauses of the other two types.
   A constituent in a medial completive clause can be questioned, as in 10.80 and 9.33. This is
a special property of these clauses which sets them apart from all other dependent clause types,
especially relative and conditional clauses (see §10.4).     19.1 j u xta p o s i t i o n o f a de p e n d e n t c laus e a n d a m a i n c laus eJuxtaposed clauses are a type of dependent clause with no segmental marking. Juxtaposed
clauses are preposed to a main clause. They mark absolute tense (unlike medial dependent
clauses whose tense is relative to that of the main clause). All aspect and tense distinctions
of main clauses can be expressed. Similarly to dependent clauses in general, and unlike main
clauses, juxtaposed clauses are negated with the subordinate negator -ma:r-. Uninﬂected aspec-
tual and modal forms require a support verb to be able to be used in juxtaposed clauses.
   A striking feature of juxtaposed clauses is their rising intonation contour with the pitch
going up on the last syllable of the predicate. This intonation contour may be the only
feature that distinguishes positive juxtaposed dependent clauses from juxtaposed main clauses
discussed at §19.7. Juxtaposed clauses are strictly verb ﬁnal.
   Juxtaposed clauses often express condition. Examples with a positive clause expressing
counterfactual condition via irrealis marking are at 13.35–6 and 14.55–7 (also see §13.3 and
§14.3.1 on irrealis in positive and in negative clauses). Examples expressing real condition are
14.58, 14.123–4, and 18.12. As shown in 14.56, whether the condition is counterfactual or not
may depend on the context, given the inherent ambiguity between irrealis and future. Example
19.1 may have either of three meanings: ‘if I had gone, I would have told you (the secret)’,

468      19 Other Dependent Clauses‘if I go, I will tell you (the secret)’, or ‘when I go, I will tell you (the secret)’. In the actual
context, the second reading was the most appropriate: the speaker had not yet gone, was not
sure if she was going, and telling the secret depended on her going to another village and
learning the details:
19.1 [wun yi-k@-tua]                         [ñ@n-a:k

     wa-k@-tua]
     say-fut-1sgsubj.vt+3fem.sgbas.vt
     ‘If I go, I will tell you (the secret)’
   That is, a real-condition reading is appropriate in 19.1. This is in contrast to -ga:y ‘unlikely
condition’ (§18.8) which always has a conditional reading. Similar examples are at T3.23 and
T3.25.
   Alternatively, a juxtaposed clause may have a purely temporal meaning. An example is at
19.2: we know that it is not conditional because of the context of the story: the man is bound
to hit the road to go back home. This example shows that a juxtaposed clause can be postposed
to the main clause, just like most other dependent clauses.

     ‘Having put (the mangoes together), do not ever half-open the stringbag as you go onto
     the road’
  A similar example is in the ﬁrst clause of T3.43. Here, the juxtaposed clause cannot possibly
have a conditional reading.
  A juxtaposed clause does not have to be contiguous with the main clause: in 19.3 a cotempo-
raneous clause intervenes between a juxtaposed clause and a main clause. This same example
shows that a juxtaposed dependent clause can itself contain a medial clause. The ‘relative tense’
of the medial clause is determined by the absolute tense of the juxtaposed clause.

   Juxtaposed clauses are similar to main clauses in most ways, except negation. No such
clauses have been documented in related languages. This clause type may constitute a recent
innovation.
                                  19.2 r e lat i v e c lau s e sRelative clauses (see Table 19.1) involve an inﬂected verb—see §19.2.1. An alternative relativiza-
tion strategy is verb-noun compounding—see §19.2.2. The two are compared in §19.2.3.
                                                                    19.2 Relative clauses       469                       19.2.1 Relative clauses with an inﬂected verbRelative clauses in Manambu are restrictive. The main clause and the relative clause must have
an argument in common. The shared argument can be stated in the main clause, but does
not have to be. It is not stated in the relative clause. Headless relative clauses are treated on
a par with any other constituents of the main clause. A relative clause typically follows the
demonstrative and precedes an adjective within an NP (see §20.1.1).
   Relative clauses share properties with a main clause: the predicate can be an inﬂected or a
partially inﬂected verb. Similarly to other dependent clauses, no predicate head other than a
verb can be used in a relative clause. Uninﬂected verbal forms and non-verbal predicate heads
require a support verb (typically, t@- ‘stand/be’) (see §17.2).
   Relative clauses are strictly verb ﬁnal. All tenses, aspects, and modalities can be expressed.
Unlike medial dependent clauses, but similarly to juxtaposed dependent clauses, no constituent
within a relative clause can be independently focused. The predicate of a relative clause can have
one or two cross-referencing positions (following the same principles as in the main clauses: see
Chapter 3). It always requires the linker -@ after a word-ﬁnal stop. The last cross-referencing
position agrees with the common argument. Relative clauses are negated with the dependent
clause negator -ma:r-, just like other dependent clauses.
   Relative clauses have no special segmental marking. Monosyllabic verbs have a somewhat
special form in relative clauses. We can recall, from §11.3.2, that when monosyllabic verbs
consisting of CV, with a root vowel either @ or a, take a suﬃx and the resulting form is
monosyllabic, the root vowel is lengthened. And the verbs with vowel a and with @ are then
homophonous, e.g. r @- ‘sit’, ra- ‘cut’, and ra:d (sit/cut+3masc.sgbas.p) ‘he sat/cut’. When
such verbs appear in relative clauses, they do not undergo vowel lengthening and there is no
homophony, e.g. r @-d-@ du (sit-3masc.sgbas.vt/p-lk man) ‘man who sits/sat’, ra-d-@ du (cut-
3masc.sgbas.vt/p-lk man) ‘man who cut(s)’. The reason lies in the syllabic structure: since a
relative clause is in the modiﬁer slot to a noun, it requires a linker (see §4.1.1), and this linker
adds an extra syllable to a monosyllabic verb. Consequently, its root vowel remains unaltered.
   As we saw in Table 19.1, relative clauses are similar to juxtaposed dependent clauses. How-
ever, they lack a special rising intonation contour; instead they tend to form one phonological
phrase with the common argument. If used headlessly (as in 14.122 and T2.67) they have the
same phonological properties as any headless NP.
   Any core or peripheral argument, including locative, temporal, instruments, associated
arguments, and possessors, can appear as a common argument (CA) in a relative clause.
There are very few restrictions on the function of the common argument in a main clause.
Only the argument of the three postpositions k@t@k ‘like; similarly’, wuk@n ‘together with’, and
kuk@- ‘behind’ cannot be relativized on. This appears to go against the hierarchy established
by Keenan and Comrie (1977): according to the hierarchy, if a language can relativize on a
possessor, it is expected to relativize on the argument of an adposition. A tentative explanation
is oﬀered at the end of this section.
   The CA in A function in a relative clause and the S function in the main clause is shown
in 19.4. A similar example is at 14.122 (where a headless relative clause contains the CA in A
function, which is also in the A function in the main clause).19.4 a     [br@-k@-m   yaku-ya-l               ta:kw-a:b] [a

470      19 Other Dependent Clauses  In 19.5 the CA is in S function in the relative clause, and S in the main clause. A similar
example is in T1.31: the CA is the S of the relative clause, and the A of the main clause (‘(We)-
the people who stay on the earth see the moon’).19.5 [d@y-a-d@            ta:y waku-d-@                    yibun-mi] [tayir

     brother (who was here) before, then said’In 19.6 the common argument is itself the head of a non-verbal predicate. A similar example is
in T1.26 (‘this is the moon who keeps shining all over this earth’), and at 14.118a–b.19.6 [væra-d-@                                   du]-ad
     come.across.towards-3masc.sgsubj.vt/p-lk man-3masc.sgnom
     ‘It is a man who is coming across towards (us)’  In 19.7 the common argument is an O in the relative clause and S in the controlling clause.
Note that the relative clause occurs together with an adjective ‘small’ in the same NP preceding
the adjective:19.7 [ [kwatiya-tua                                    kwasa        lapa-ñ@g]

     ‘After you have brought the small book (lit. banana leaf) I gave you (to the village), may
     it stay in your hand’ (that is, do not let your sister get it)   In 18.14, the ﬁrst clause of 16.40 and in the third line of T1.4, the CA is the O in both
relative clause and main clause. In 19.45, it is the O of the relative clause and a location in a
main clause. In 18.56 (‘having cleaned [ . . . ] the rubbish which was staying in his teeth’), the CA
is the S of the relative clause and the O of the main clause. This is also an example of a relative
clause within a dependent clause. A similar example is at 19.8: the CA is S of the relative clause
(with an aspectual complex predicate which has a transitivity-neutralizing eﬀect: §16.2.3 and
§17.1.1), and O of the main clause:19.8 [a-d@             t@p@-taka-n         r@-d-@                  kaw] ma: v@

     ‘He (the human child) did not see the hole which had been covered up’ (lit. ‘stayed closed’)   The ﬁrst line of T1.4 illustrates relativization on the addressee. The CA is in A function in the
main clause. A CA can be a nominal component of a lexicalized complex predicate noun-dat

   And 19.14 illustrates the possessee, ‘dog’, as a common argument; it is the S of the main
clause:

   The argument structure and the marking of arguments in relative clauses is the same as
that in main clauses, unless the CA is the possessor closely associated with the possessee. Such
possessees include kinship relations, as in 19.15, body parts, as in 19.16, and physical states, as
in 19.17a–b. Then, the possessee is zero marked and preposed to the predicate of the relative
clause followed by the CA. That is, ‘men whose wives died’ are literally ‘wife they-died men’,
‘man whose hand you shook’ is ‘hand you-shook man’, and ‘boy whose fever goes up’ is ‘fever

  A similar relative clause construction occurs whenever a connection between the possessor
and the possessee can be conceived as close enough and culturally acceptable. That is, 19.18a
was judged possible, but 19.18b was treated as contrived, the reason being that children do not
really own mice or rats:
19.18a a:s kiya-d-@                 ñan
       dog die-3masc.sgbas.p-lk child
       ‘a child whose dog died’ (lit. dog he-died child, or child dead with respect to dog)
19.18b ?wakuli    kiya-d-@            ñan
       mouse/rat die-3masc.sgbas.p-lk child
       ‘a child whose mouse died’?
   The possessor in 19.15–18 can be in any function in a main clause. Its function in a relative
clause is the subject (S, as in 19.15, 19.17–18) or the object (as in 19.16): this function is
indicated by the person, number, gender, and tense markers on the predicate of the relative
clause. The possessees in the relative clauses in 19.15–18 are ambiguous as to their syntactic
functions: they can be considered part of the S in 19.15, 19.17–18, and part of O in 19.16.
                                                                   19.2 Relative clauses      473This creates an unusual clause type, only found in relative clauses involving relativization of
possessor.
   From a semantic point of view, the phenomenon of ‘extraction’ of an inalienably possessed
noun and change in its argument status is akin to the phenomenon known as double object
construction. For instance, in Tariana (Arawak: Aikhenvald 2003: 156–7) if a possessive con-
struction containing a body part or any inalienably possessed item is in a non-subject function
in a clause, both possessor and the possessee acquire the non-subject case marking and are
treated as objects. In constructions known as ‘external possession’, the possessor is coded as a
‘core grammatical relation of the verb and in a constituent separate from that which contains’
the possessee (see Payne and Barshi 1999: 3).
   We have just seen that in Manambu, relative clauses involving possession with a close
link between the possessor and the possessee have the surface structure of either double
subject or double object. And the relativization in Manambu appears to go against the NP
accessibility hierarchy proposed by Keenan and Comrie (1977): the hierarchy predicts that if a
language allows relativization on possessors, it should also allow relativization on arguments
of adpositions. However, the analysis above suggests that in Manambu possessors need to be
transformed into either a subject or an object (depending on the function of the possessive
construction in the main clause), before they can be relativized. Possessors as such cannot
be relativized on. That is, relativization in Manambu does in fact conform to the hierarchy
suggested by Keenan and Comrie.
   If there is a close association between the process and the result, the ‘associated result’ can
also be relativized on. This is illustrated in 19.19: the man looked into the house and saw the
ﬁre lit by the woman (CA is O in the relative clause and in the main clause), and also saw what
literally translates as ‘the smoke that she was cooking’—that is, the smoke associated with, or
coming from, her cooking:19.19 [a                apaw       ta:kw aka

      then look.inside see-3fem.sgsubj.vt+3fem.sgbas.vt
      ‘He saw inside (the house) the ﬁre lit by that old woman, the smoke of her cooking (lit.
      cooking she-do smoke, or the smoke associated with her doing cooking)’  Along similar lines, 19.20 literally translates as ‘these are the pictures which they spoke at
a name debate called “saki” ’, meaning ‘these are the pictures to do with (that is, taken at the
time of) a name debate “saki” ’:19.20 [saki         bla-dana                         kayik]-adi
      name.debate speak-3plsubj.vt+3fem.sgbas.vt picture-3plnom
      ‘These are the pictures of them speaking at the name debate “saki” ’ (lit. name debate
      they-speak pictures)   There are no grammatical restrictions on the nature of an associated participant.
   Since any core argument can be relativized on, ambiguity may arise: 19.21 allows for two
interpretations—since both participants, the man and his companion, are marked with the
same third person singular masculine cross-referencing:

      ‘This companion of his said to that man who was about to hit him: “I won’t hit you” ’ or
      ‘This companion of his said to that man whom he was about to hit: “I won’t hit you” ’
  In the context of the story, only the second reading is appropriate. If the common argument
and the core argument(s) of the main clause require diﬀerent gender and number marking, no
ambiguity arises—see 19.28.
  Overt expression of participants in a relative clause is an alternative way of disambiguating
the role of the CA. A clause kwa-na-d-@ wi (stay-act.foc-3masc.sgbas.vt-lk house) is ambigu-
ous: adding an additional argument allows us to disambiguate between ‘a house that stays (is
located) on a hill’ and ‘a house where someone stays’:
19.22a [n@b@k@m        kwa-na-d-@                        wi]-ad
       hill+lk+loc stay-act.foc-3masc.sgbas.vt-lk house-3masc.sgnom
       ‘It is a house that stays (is located) on a hill’
19.22b [du kwa-na-d-@                            wi]-ad
       man stay-act.foc-3masc.sgbas.vt-lk house-3masc.sgnom
       ‘It is a house where a man stays (lives)’
Any relative clause can be used without a head. If the head is omitted, the verb takes the
case marking which the common argument would have taken had it been there. In 14.122 the
headless relative clause, ‘(people) who do not work’, is in the A function of a main clause,
and in T2.67 (‘those we were talking about’) it is in S function. A dative case-marked headless
relative clause is illustrated in 19.23a. The omitted common argument is in the O function in
the relative clause, and in the function of second argument of the complex verb ‘ask’ which
requires dative marking:
19.23a g@ñ@r bas s@-k@-tua-di                         [a-di
       later ﬁrst plant-fut-1sgsubj.vt-3plbas.vt dem.dist-pl
       laku-mar-tua-di:k]
       understand-neg.sub-1sgsubj.vt-3plbas.vt+dat
       ‘I will ask later about (the ones) I do not understand’
  If the CA had not been omitted, it would have taken the dative case:
19.23b g@ñ@r bas s@-k@-tua-di                        [a-di
       later ﬁrst plant-fut-1sgsubj.vt-3plbas.vt dem.dist-pl
       laku-ma:r-tua-di                            maj@k]
       understand-neg.sub-1sgsubj.vt-3plbas.vt word+lk+dat
       ‘I will ask later about words I do not understand’
  And in 19.24a the omitted CA is an S in the relative clause. In the main clause it is a location,
marked with the comitative case (see §7.9). Since the CA is omitted, the case marking goes onto
the verb.
19.24a [a              væk r@-lawa]                             mæy
       dem.dist.fem.sg pot sit-3fem.sgsubj.vt+3fem.sgbas.vt+com come.impv
       ‘Come by the (area) where that pot sits’
                                                                    19.2 Relative clauses      475  If the CA had not been omitted, the sentence would be:
19.24b [a              væk r@-la                            tamiya-wa]  mæy
       dem.dist.fem.sg pot sit-3fem.sgsubj.vt+3fem.sgbas.vt area+lk-com come.impv
       ‘Come by the area where that pot sits’
   This is how what looks like a fully inﬂected verb can take a case marker (see §7.11, for
the discussion of case marking on verbs). A similar example is in T3.43, with a headless
relative clause ata wa-tua-di-a-wa (then say-1sgsubj.vt-3plbas.vt-lk-com) ‘with those (the
words) which I was saying’.
   We can recall, from 19.7–8, that a relative clause follows a demonstrative and precedes an
adjective modifying a common argument. This same order holds if the CA is omitted, as in
19.25. The CA is the O function in both relative and main clause:
19.25 [a                    wuk@mar-tua]                        kwasa
      dem.dist.fem.sg forget-1sgsubj.vt+3fem.sgbas.vt little+fem.sg

      dem.dist.react.top.fem.sg tell-fut-1sgsubj.vt+3fem.sgbas.vt
      ‘I will tell that little (bit of a story) which I forgot’
  A headless relative clause in an elliptical sentence looks exactly like a main clause would
look. A speaker heard a woman shout from the next-door house, and asked S@-k@-l-al? (who-
obl-fem.sg-3fem.sgnom) ‘Who is this?’ Gemaj answered 19.26:
19.26 anaki                            wiya:m          r@-na
      dem.curr.rel+across.away house+lk+loc sit-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt
      ‘(It is the one who) lives in previously mentioned the house across from us (meaning our
      next-door neighbour Esther-Yuaya:b)’
   An alternative interpretation for this clause could have been ‘She lives in previously men-
tioned the house across from us’; but this interpretation would not have made sense under
the circumstances. That is, a headless relative clause—if it is not negated—can sometimes be
distinguished from a main clause by context only. If it is negated, it takes the dependent clause
negator -ma:r- which a normal main clause does not take (except under special circumstances:
§14.5.3). In addition, all relative clauses, including headless ones, can be used as complementa-
tion strategies—see §19.8.
   Relative clauses are very common in every genre of Manambu. An alternative strategy is
verb-noun compounds.","[475, 476, 477, 478, 479, 480, 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488, 489, 490, 491, 492, 493, 494, 495, 496, 497, 498, 499, 500, 501, 502]"

          13.4.3 Same-subject and diﬀerent-subject purposive: a comparisonThroughout this section, we saw that same-subject and diﬀerent-subject purposive share a
number of properties. The two are marked with suﬃxes which could well be etymologically
related. They diﬀer in form depending on the syllable weight of the root (Table 2.4).
   In terms of their semantics, same-subject purposive and diﬀerent-subject purposive parallel
each other. We will see, in §14.3, that they are negated somewhat diﬀerently. Diﬀerent-subject
purposive is more often used in non-main clauses than the same-subject purposive. The process
of desubordination is likely to account for the uses of both same-subject and diﬀerent-subject
purposive in main clauses.
   The two forms diﬀer in a number of ways. A diﬀerent-subject purposive can only occur
in purposive complements, while same-subject purposive can occur in any dependent clause
as a copula complement (as illustrated at 13.44). Only the same-subject purposive takes part
in forming complex predicates (§17.1.2). This is a feature it shares with the desiderative -k@r,
discussed in the next section.
                                    13.5 de s i d e rat i v eDesiderative is an uninﬂected verb form marked with the suﬃx -k@r. The major meaning of
desiderative in main clauses is the desire to perform an activity, as in 13.56.
                                                                        13.5 Desiderative   29113.56 ñ@n     yi-k@r d@yawa?
      you.fem go-des they+lk+com
      ‘Do you want to go with them?’
  A similar example is at 11.9, said ironically by a woman; other examples are in T1.30, T2.12,
and T3.45. A clause containing a direct speech report with a desiderative-marked verb is a
conventional way of reporting other people’s desires and intentions. An example is at 13.57—
this was said about a 15-month-old child who could not yet talk:
13.57 di yi-k@r wa-na
      shit go-des say-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt
      ‘She wants to shit’ (lit. she says (I) want to shit)
  In 13.58, from a letter, the same construction ‘say Verb-desiderative’ is used to refer to the
wishes of a second person:
13.58 [t@p-a:r        Apat@p-a:r       yi-k@r a
      village-lk+all Avatip-lk+all go-des dem.dist+fem.sg
      wa-m@n@-l]                       [klay                    August bap        m@yir

      ‘(Suppose) you want to go to Avatip (lit. you say go-desiderative), if you really want to
      go this (coming) August, tell me quickly’
  Desiderative in a main clause with non-volitional predicates implies that something is to
happen, as in 13.59–60. A purposive would be inappropriate in either of these instances,
because—unlike desiderative—it implies controlled and volitional activity.
13.59 t@b g@l        war-na                             wa:l ja-k@r
      sky blackness go.up-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt rain fall-des

      ‘It is almost one o’clock’ (lit. it is almost staying going to become one o’clock)
   Desiderative can be used to express purpose, as in 12.62 (‘They (men) surrounded (the men’s
house) fully, looking-desiderative for women’), and in 13.61. The same-subject purposive would
have been possible here, but with a diﬀerence in meaning: purposive implies deﬁnite intention
very likely to succeed, while the desiderative indicates that there is no reason to believe that
the intention will be successful. In both 12.62 and 13.61 the intended action had indeed failed:
the villagers were unable to get sago because they were attacked. That is, desiderative may have
slightly frustrative overtones.
13.61 d@y a-d@                 t@p-a     du ta:kw nagw-@k           yi-k@r aban

      taka-na-di
      put-act.foc-3plbas.vt
      ‘These people (lit. man woman) of that village made arrangements to go get sago’
  Desiderative also occurs in complex predicates consisting of an inﬂected form of the verb
kur- ‘do, get’ preceding the desiderative, with the meaning of impending intention. This is very
292     13 Mood and Modalitysimilar to a complex predicate consisting of kur- and same-subject purposive, as in 17.15–
16. The diﬀerence in meaning is consistent with the diﬀerence between the purposive and
the desiderative: the woman’s death in 17.16 is imminent and cannot be prevented; while the
intended actions (of cats) in 13.62 can. Once again, the desiderative in a dependent clause
implies that the intention is not bound to be realized. (Also see §17.1.2.)13.62 [pusi k@-k@r kur-da-l@k]        væga-tua-di
      cat eat-des do/get-3pl-because put.inside.bag-1sgsubj.vt-3plbas.vt
      ‘Because cats might be about to eat (the foodstuﬀs) I put (the foodstuﬀs inside the
      basket)’   Just like the same-subject purposive, the desiderative can head a dependent clause; then
it has to take the polyfunctional verb t@- as support verb, as is typical for any uninﬂected
verb. Examples are at 13.63–4—semantically similar but not identical with 13.44. The speaker
said 13.63 on Friday—this is an example of future projection, corroborated by the future and
potential meaning of n@b@ ‘able, can’ (see §4.5).13.63 [fonde yi-k@r tu-ku]          n@b@ va:l                sa:n
      Monday go-des be-compl.ss able see+3fem.sgbas.p money
      ‘On Monday, after (you) are about to go, one can see about money’   This example has an overtone of indeterminacy to do with something that might, or might
not, happen in the future. (The hesitation and indeterminacy is also characteristic of the
attitude of the people to any mention of money: they do not mind accepting it as a present, but
feel shy discussing anything to do with it.)
   Example 13.64 was said to describe a picture from the same album as 13.44. The diﬀerence
was that in 13.44 the uncle was shown as embarking on a canoe, while the picture described by
13.64 only showed us preparing for an impending trip.13.64 [yi-k@r t@-da-l]                    ñ@-a
      go-des be-3plsubj.p-3fem.sgbas.p day-3fem.sgnom
      ‘This is the day they were about to go’   In summary, same-subject purposive implies controlled activity and intention which is
bound to come to fruition. In contrast, the desiderative expresses non-controlled activities
(such as time and weather) and activities which are desirable but may or may not take place.
   A clause with a desiderative can be used as a complementation strategy, as in 13.65. This
describes a prohibition on marrying women from the same clan as oneself:13.65 [awarwa    ta:kw kra-k@r] a                     n@ma         apaw
      each.other woman take-des dem.dist+fem.sg big.fem.sg old.fem.sg
      va:l-a
      taboo-3fem.sgnom
      ‘Wanting to marry each other’s women is a big strong (lit. old) taboo’   The desiderative marker may, or may not, be related to the purposive. Its most likely cognate
is the Iatmul marker -k1t, which functions as an indirect object case on nouns and as a verbal
purposive (Brugnowi dialect: Staalsen n.d.a).
                                                                         13.6 Frustrative      293                                     13.6 f rus t rat i v eFrustrative indicates that the action was done to no avail—that is, the desired result was not
achieved. Frustrative is an uninﬂected verb, but, unlike other uninﬂected verbs, frustrative
makes a distinction between durative and non-durative action. Durative frustrative is marked
with the suﬃx -p on the verb stem and repetition of the frustrative form. This indicates that the
action which failed to achieve the result took place over a lengthy period of time—as in 13.66.
The form can be repeated from two to ﬁve times, but hardly ever more than that. The more
times the form is repeated, the lengthier the failed attempt is supposed to be. The repeated
frustrative-marked verbs form one intonation unit, and no other constituent can intervene
between them.
   A clause containing a frustrative form is typically accompanied by another clause indicating
either why the action failed, as in 13.66, or what was done after it failed, as in 13.67 and T3.31.13.66 lagu-p lagu-p lagu-p suan         yi-na
      pull-fr pull-fr pull-fr diﬃcult go-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt
      ‘(He) pulled and pulled and pulled (the canoe out of mud) in vain, it was hard’  Like any uninﬂected verb, the durative frustrative can only occur in a dependent clause as a
copula complement of t@-, as in 13.67 and T3.29. Then there is only one copula no matter how
many times the durative frustrative form is repeated—this is an argument in favour of treating
the durative frustrative as one predicate, and not as repetition of several predicates:13.67 [d@ asa:y war-d@-l                             wiya:r]          [kap@-n r@-p r@-p

      ‘The father went up into the house, having sat and sat and sat and sat waiting in vain,
      having said, “oh”, he went down’   The non-durative frustrative is marked with -yak@p. This form contains no indication as to
how long the frustrated attempt had lasted. The form is usually not repeated. We can recall,
from §2.4.2, that -yak@p is syllable-weight sensitive. If a verb root has a CV(C)V, a CVC, or a
CCV/CVC structure, the form of the marker is -yak@p, as in kwak@-yak@p (look.for-fr) ‘look
for in vain’, kayket@-yak@p ‘hold onto something in vain’, gra-yak@p ‘cry in vain’. If a verb
consists of a CV, the frustrative suﬃx undergoes initial CVCV reduplication, as in ya-yak@-
yak@p (come-red-fr) ‘come in vain’, v@-yak@-yak@p ‘look in vain; be unable to see’. The verb
v@- ‘see’ is unusual in that it has an alternative non-durative frustrative form v@-k@tak@p—this
is illustrated below. This alternative form ﬁts in with the iambic stress pattern characteristic of
weight-sensitive suﬃxes—see §2.4.2.13.68 v@-yak@-yak@p væ:n      r@-da-l

294      13 Mood and Modality  In 13.70, the frustrative of the verb ‘say’ refers to calling in vain—there was no answer. The
action of calling and getting no answer is repeated in diﬀerent clauses, to show that this was
done twice.

      ‘He said to her, “I have already collected the breadfruit”, he said in vain (there was no
      answer), he said to her, he said in vain, OK, he called, and he stayed that way’
  If a verb contains -ya ‘come’ as the last syllable, the frustrative -yak@p is ‘shortened’ to -k@p,
as in 13.71. Such haplology is unusual.

      ‘He looked for her this way and that way in vain, nothing, he went back’
  Like any uninﬂected verb, a frustrative -yak@p can only be used in a dependent clause as a
copula complement:
13.72 [a    wun-a:k kwak@-yak@p t@-ku]            [wun-a-di ja:p buti-ku]

      ‘Having looked for me in vain, having packed my things, by entering (inside the bush)
      they hid them together with their things’
  The two frustrative markers may well be etymologically related: they share the formative -p.
We can hypothesize that -yak@- in -yak@p could be related to -yak@- ‘do fully’ (see §15.3.1), and
that -k@ta- in v@-k@tak@p could be linked to -k@ta- ‘try’, as in k@-k@ta ‘try eating’. However,
these hypotheses require further substantiation.
  Unlike the other modal forms discussed so far, neither of the frustratives can be negated.
        13.7 no m i na l i zat i o n s m a r k e d w i t h dat i v e -av e r s i v e c a s eWe saw in §9.1.1 (under II) that deverbal nominalizations marked with the dative-aversive case
-Vk express a variety of modal meanings to do with future projection, unrealized wishes, weak
probability, or events to be prevented from happening. When used in the predicate slot, these
nominalizations behave like any uninﬂected verb; examples are at 13.73–5.

      ‘They would like to come tomorrow (but won’t be able to)’
   In 13.74, the ﬁrst occurrence of dative-aversive-marked nominalization expresses a wish. This
is a typical meaning of the dative-aversive case (see §7.4). The second occurrence of dative-
aversive-marked nominalization is ambiguous: we recall, from §13.4.1, that these forms are

(as in T3.40, third line, and 13.74) can be interpreted either as a dative-aversive nominalization,
meaning ‘might stay’, or as same-subject purposive, meaning ‘going to stay’. The ambiguity
can be resolved by the context, and under negation (see §14.3).

   Dative-aversive case-marked nominalizations may express weak probability, both in ques-
tions and in statements. In 13.75, a grandmother is desperately looking for her two grandchil-
dren, asking in every men’s house in Avatip village:
13.75 wun-a-b@r na:         viti k@-l-@-m            kwa-kwa:k?

  After a younger sister refused point blank to let her estranged paternal uncle stay in her
house, her brother asks her, without much hope:

      ‘What are you saying then, let it be, (is he) to go to another house perhaps?’
  Nominalizations are also used in rhetorical questions:
13.77 aw k@ta s@      kui-kui-k                eh?
      then now who give.to.third.p-red-dat eh?
      ‘Then now (after everything bad he did to us), who is going to give him (things), eh?’
   Dative-aversive-marked nominalizations are used as clausal complements in contexts which
would require the dative-aversive case on a noun phrase. These include verbs with a negative
meaning, e.g. ‘feel shame’, as in 9.6, ‘say no’, or ‘forbid, refuse’, as in 9.5 and 13.78 (cf. also
10.35), ‘forget’, as in 13.79, ‘be diﬃcult’, as in 9.9 and 13.80, and ‘be unwilling’ (lit. go for
little), as in 13.81.

      ‘She forbids you to walk around’ (lit. she says ‘no’ to you walking around)
  As can be seen from examples such as 13.79–81, a dative-aversive-marked nominalization
can precede or follow the main (inﬂected) verb.

      ‘If one has a garden close (to the village), they might steal (vegetables from it)’  A dative-aversive nominalization on its own may have an apprehensive meaning, just like
dative-aversive case forms (see §7.4):13.86 kiya-kiya-k
      die-red-dat
      ‘(Do not go there) lest you die!’  The aversive use of dative-aversive-marked nominalizations in main clauses is another
instance of desubordination of verb forms which are predominantly used in dependent clauses.
  In all the cases discussed above, dative-aversive case-marked nominalizations occupy the
second argument slot of a verb. They can also occupy the S slot of a non-verbal predicate
with a negative meaning, as shown in 13.87. This sentence states a convention concerning
men’s road and women’s road in Avatip. (A corresponding positive statement would require a
ø-marked nominalization: see §9.1.1.) A noun phrase marked with dative-aversive case cannot
be used this way. Examples like 13.87 oﬀer an argument in favour of considering fully redupli-
cated verbs marked with the suﬃx -k as separate modal forms which are homonymous, rather
than polysemous, with a dative-aversive (-Vk) case form of a deverbal action nominalization.
                                                                        13.8 Summary        29713.87 k@ta-n-ab         [ñan-a-d@      t@p    ta:kw du-a-yab@r                 yi-ya:k]

   What I call dative-aversive-marked nominalizations are obligatorily used in an additional
type of dependent conditional clause introduced by the adverb k@pa:b ‘in case’ (most probably,
terminative case of k@p ‘just’). The meaning of such clauses is ‘in case VERB’ as in 13.88.
Unlike the examples above (especially 13.84–5), the verb does not have to have any negative
connotations.
13.88 kusu-n ap              k@pa:b r@p@-r@p-@k
      wear-seq impv+see in.case be.enough-red-dat
      ‘Try it (dress) on, just in case it ﬁts’ or ‘to see if it ﬁts’
   Such forms are identical to dative-aversive nominalizations. However, like any non-main
clause forms they require a suﬃxed negator -ma:r-, albeit in a somewhat diﬀerent form (see
§14.3 and §14.5.1). The ways in which nominalizations are negated are discussed in §14.3.3.
This is an argument in favour of the reduplicated verbs marked with -k in ‘in case’ clauses
being special modal forms, homonymous with other, seemingly identical, forms.
                                           13.8 s ummaryManambu is rich in modal forms. The imperative mood has three person sub-paradigms which
diﬀer from each other in their form, function, and semantics. The optative modality can be
formed on imperative, and on the irrealis.
   The pervasive problem in distinguishing tenses and modalities in Manambu is that of
polysemy versus homophony. We have already discussed similar problems with cases, and will
return to the same problem in the lexicon, in Chapter 21. The irrealis forms are homophonous
with future, and can only be formally distinguished under negation. Same-subject purposive is
homophonous with dative-aversive case-marked nominalizations of light monosyllabic verbs;
again, the two are negated diﬀerently.
   Dative-aversive case-marked nominalizations are used in main clauses, and as clausal com-
plements. Their lookalikes express condition in dependent clauses meaning ‘in case (something
happens)’—that these are diﬀerent forms can only be seen in the ways they are negated.
   The use of same- and diﬀerent-subject purposives in main clauses involves the process of
desubordination. The same process appears to be at work with dative-aversive case-marked
nominalizations used in an apprehensive meaning, that is, as warnings.
   The desiderative modality is relatively unproblematic in terms of its semantics. In contrast,
frustrative oﬀers a choice between durative and non-durative, absent from any other modality.
Frustrative is the only modality which cannot be negated.
         14         Negation
Manambu has a highly complicated system of negation. The choice of a negative form cor-
relates with the tense, aspect, mood, and modality value of the clause, and with clause type.
We saw above that negation is often the only means of distinguishing otherwise homophonous
verb forms, and clause types.           14.1 ne gat i o n o f d e c la rat i v e n o n- h a b i t ua l c laus e sAll declarative non-habitual clauses are negated with the negator ma:. Just as in positive
clauses, verbal predicates diﬀer from non-verbal predicates in what tense distinctions are
expressed under negation (see §12.1). Negation of verbal predicates (including copulas) is
discussed in §14.1.1. In §14.1.2 we look at how non-verbal predicates are negated.
   The verbal negator ma: (variants: ma:n, ma""an, ma""a) has clausal scope, and is also used as
a pro-clause meaning ‘no’. The forms ma: and ma""a are in free variation; and so are ma:n and
ma""an (see §2.1.2). The variants ma: and ma:n are in free distribution in most instances, with
the variant ma:n found only with traditional and older speakers. The only noted diﬀerence
between the two is discussed under §14.1.2 (example 14.15). Additional uses of the negator ma:
are discussed in §14.6. See the discussion in §14.1.3.","[317, 318, 319, 320, 321, 322, 323, 324, 325]"

conversations, from over ﬁfty speakers, male and female, including three children (during the
period between 1995 and 2004). About 95 per cent of the materials come from the speakers in
Avatip, and the rest are from Malu and Yawabak. All the texts were transcribed and translated
with the assistance of linguistic consultants.
   Texts include traditional tales (genre termed gabu-ma:j), traditional stories about historical
events which are passed on from one generation to another (wa-saki-ma:j and blajaya-ma:j), life
stories, and stories about recent happenings and developments, and various songs (mourning
songs gra-kudi, and laments about foiled marriages namay and sui). Three sample texts have
been included at the end of the grammar. Other stories will be available as a web-accessible
resource in the near future.
   The materials were collected during ﬁeld sessions, and then transcribed and translated.
Elicitation was used very sparingly, and as much as possible was through Manambu. It
was employed to complete paradigms, and check hypotheses. Speakers were presented with
a putative sentence, or a description of a situation in Manambu, rather than asking them
to translate a sentence from Tok Pisin or English. Participant observation played a con-
siderable role in discovering the ways in which the language is used. The Manambu—
especially the women—are patient and dedicated teachers, always eager to oﬀer correc-
tions and new ways of saying things, providing additional invaluable linguistic information.
The linguistic insights of such natural linguistic analysts as Jacklyn Yuamali Benji Ala,
Pauline Agnes Yuaneng Luma Laki, Jennie Kudapa:kw, Patricia Yuawalup, Katie Teke-
tay, David Takendu, and James Katalu Balangawi helped us unfold the beauty and intri-
cacy of the Manambu language. Throughout this book, I make occasional observations
on how Manambu relates to other Ndu languages (based on the few published sources,
and the unpublished documents made available to me through the generosity of the SIL at
Ukarumpa).

         2         Phonology
Manambu is more complex in its phonology than most other Ndu languages. It has a large
inventory of phonemes (twenty-one consonants and nine vowels), contrastive stress, and an
array of phonological processes. 1 Most loans are assimilated to the Manambu phonology.
Morphophonological processes relevant for nouns are discussed in §4.1.1, and those relevant
for verbs in §11.3. Examples throughout the grammar are given in their phonological represen-
tation. The phonological sequences y@ and w@ are rendered as yi and wu, to reﬂect their most
frequent surface realization.
                               2.1 s egmental phonolo gyConsonants and their realizations are discussed in §2.1.1. We discuss the vowel system in §2.1.2.
In §2.1.3 we discuss unusual phonetic segments restricted to interjections and baby talk.","[55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63]"
"   In actual fact, these items are used interchangeably by those living in Avatip and in Malu
(though at least some Manambu purists, most of whom reside outside the villages, make
it a point to never use expressions from a diﬀerent dialect). For instance, an Avatip man
spontaneously said: ar@p ka:w t@-na-d (bush.knife sharpness have-pres-3masc.sgbas) ‘the knife
is sharp’, using the form ar@ p, from the Malu variety.
   As a result of ongoing levelling of dialectal diﬀerences, speakers are often unable to dis-
tinguish which form belongs to which dialect. There are several ways of referring to being
thirsty. Avatip speakers reject kwa:l yas- (throat feel-) as being either Malu or Yuanab; gu
yasa- (water exist-) is judged to be better, but still not quite right (it is said that this form
must be Malu). I was advised to say gu k@-k@r (water eat-des) ‘I want to drink water’ or,
with a somewhat diﬀerent meaning, kwa:l gu-a:k wurt@ p@-na (throat water-lk+dat long-
act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt) ‘I am very thirsty’, to avoid any confusion. The speakers themselves
used the ﬁrst three forms interchangeably.
   Dialect levelling does not always imply language attrition—it is, for instance, a well-known
fact that the spread of radio and television results in the levelling of dialect diﬀerences in just
about every language, including English. Neither does dialect levelling necessarily imply the
‘death’ of a particular dialect—it may imply the creation of a new system incorporating features
of several dialects, and thus be similar to ‘koineization’ (a similar situation for Koiari, a not-yet-
endangered Papuan language, was reported by Tom Dutton, p.c.). But with incipient language
attrition already in place, dialect mixture and dialect merging may lead to disruption of lexical
and grammatical rules, and thus to the development of new variability.
   The major feature of Manambu language attrition lies in stylistic reduction and loss
of traditional knowledge. Such stylistic reduction has been noted for numerous languages
of Papua New Guinea. For instance, the knowledge of a ritual ‘pandanus’ language used by
a number of peoples of the Southern Highlands Province during the harvest of pandanus
nuts has decreased during the past thirty to forty years, as Franklin and Stefaniw (1992)
report for Kewa and Imbongu (Kewa has about 25,000 speakers, and Imbongu has 16,000;
neither of these languages is in any immediate danger of becoming extinct). Stylistic reduction
often pre-dates language obsolescence (as was the case with Dyirbal ‘Mother-in-law’ language:
Dixon 1990). For instance, the oratorical style sesade kwanif associated with the ritual food
exchange in Abu"" Arapesh was dying out in the 1960s, long before children stopped acquiring
the language (Nekitel 1985: 182). Tuzin (1976) made similar observations for Ilahita Arapesh.
622     22 Genetic and Areal Relationships   In the case of Manambu, stylistic reduction goes along several lines. First, the breakdown in
the transmission of traditional knowledge and in the continuation of rituals brings about a lack
of access to certain genres. One such genre is name debating, s@ saki. The fact that at least some
industrious people go oﬀ to towns to pursue a career of European-based education means that,
even if they have traditional knowledge themselves, they do not transmit it to their children.
Neither do many of those who remain in the village. Two traditional speech styles, songs of
foiled love aﬀairs (namay and sui) and funerary laments (gra-kudi), involve the deployment of
Iatmul-based ‘shadowy’ lexicon and of totemic terms relating to the clan of the man or the
woman mourned. Simon Harrison, during his work with old men in the 1980s, managed to
get them to sing namay without any hesitation. My own experience with older women singing
namay and sui in 2001–2 and 2004 was that many of them showed signs of hesitation in the
choice of appropriate terms. During various mortuary feasts (K@k@t@ p) held at the village at
this time, only a few very old women knew how to sing gra-kudi properly, which was a cause of
worry to some members of the community.
   These genres require the use of totemic equivalents for numerous words, referred to as ‘other
side’, or ‘shadowy’ lexicon (see §22.3). Knowledge of this is virtually non-existent among
younger people; and this results in drastic lexical reduction. While one could possibly argue
that the knowledge of the ‘other side’ lexicon implied a certain amount of diglossia, this
diglossia is at present on its way out.
   Younger speakers and those speakers who employ mostly Tok Pisin in their day-to-day life
frequently face problems of word retrieval and incipient lexical obsolescence. This involves
time words, numerals, and especially Manambu personal names (and also terms for ﬂora and
fauna). Most speakers of Manambu can count up to ten in the language; younger speakers ﬁnd
it hard to count beyond ten; only a few can count up to twenty. But those who do count further
tend to somewhat regularize the system, as shown in Table 10.9. Needless to say, younger
speakers were much more comfortable counting in Tok Pisin than in Manambu—which is a
source of chagrin to their parents, and to themselves; we can recall, from §10.6, that speakers
of Manambu are ‘number-proud’.
   Younger people are often ill at ease with kinship terms: it is easier for them to say brata
(Tok Pisin ‘brother’), susa (Tok Pisin ‘sister’), or anti (from English ‘auntie’), rather than be
more precise and distinguish siblings in terms of age, or diﬀerent types of ‘aunties’ depend-
ing on whether paternal or maternal. Word-retrieval problems result in increased frequency
of the catch-all ma:gw ‘what’s its name’, and the ‘lazy’ general verb m@gi- (see §21.3.1–
2; and 21.42). Many young speakers do not know their own Manambu names, let alone
those of their peers. In a culture where personal names are an important part of one’s
knowledge and are considered on a par with material wealth such obsolescence is tragic.
Problems in word retrieval result in a growing insecurity of younger speakers, another
common consequence of language obsolescence. Urban Manambu, who have lost their ﬂuency,
and village teenagers, who are unsure of themselves, prefer to answer in Tok Pisin when
addressed in Manambu, to avoid potential communication problems, and also for fear of
being ridiculed for their mistakes (similar tendencies are reported for Abu"" Arapesh by Nekitel
1998).
   Code-switching within a multilingual context comes in a variety of guises (see Clyne 1987;
Gumperz 1982 on types, functions, and constraints on code-switching). Code-switching may
obey strict rules, as is often the case in situations of di- and polyglossia, which imply sta-
ble functional diﬀerentiation of languages in distinct domains. Code-switching may depend
on the communicative situation without involving diglossia as such (Aikhenvald 2002a:
187–209).
                                                  22.6 Incipient language obsolescence       623   In situational code-switching, the domain determines the language used—so, in the con-
text of the Sepik area, Tok Pisin would be expected at meetings of the local council, and
Manambu during discussions concerning mortuary rituals. Alternatively, code-switching may
be unrestricted (Landweer 2000: 7): the language choice may change without any functional
diﬀerentiation or consistency, simply because speakers are more proﬁcient in one language
than in the other. Similar patterns were discussed by Kulick (1987) for Taiap (and also see
Nekitel 1992: 56 on extensive code-switching in Abu"" Arapesh as indicative of the growing lack
of language proﬁciency).
   Unrestricted code-switching is thus concomitant with lexical obsolescence and insecurity of
those speakers who do not have suﬃcient exposure to the vernacular. In the Manambu context,
frequent unrestricted code-switching is an indicator of speakers eﬀectively losing allegiance to
their ancestral language (Landweer 2000: 7), and is in itself disquieting.
   We now turn to the perspective of Manambu language survival.","[648, 649, 650]"

  A generic statement concerning the cassowary’s son’s living habits involves verb-noun
compounds—he never stays in closed-up areas preferring clearings in the jungle.

      ‘Before he never used to stay in closed area. Having looked around, he would stay in an

   In contrast, in 19.34, the central character stayed on a speciﬁc clearing he had just found:
19.34 [tugwam na-l@-l                            tamia:m]    ata

      ra:d
      stay+3masc.sgbas.p
      ‘He then stayed in the clearing’
  The generic meaning of a noun in a compound structure agrees with a general princi-
ple: nouns in compounds are typically non-referential and non-speciﬁc (see Mithun 1984;
Aikhenvald 2007).
  As mentioned in §9.3, verb-noun compounds are productive, and new ones are always being
coined spontaneously. Scolding her daughter for being clumsy, a mother exclaimed 19.35:
19.35 gu      kaykwa-tami:-al          a
      water spill-area-3fem.sgnom eh
      ‘Is this the area for spilling water?’
   In addition, they often get lexicalized, and acquire somewhat unpredictable meanings. So,
gra-kudi (cry-language) is not just ‘language with which people cry’; it is a term for ‘mourning
songs’, and wa-saki-ma:j (say-across.away-talk) refers to traditional stories which are trans-
mitted across generations. Similarly, ku-su-ja:p (put-up-thing) is a generic term for ‘clothing’,
ku-su-mæ:n (put-up-leg) is a generic term for ‘footwear’, and s@-kwa-ja:p (sleep-stay-thing)
is used for ‘sleeping gear’. Such compounds frequently become names. For instance, kiya-du
‘dead man’ is used as the name of a Manambu football team in Avatip whose members live not
too far from a local cemetery. 1
   In contrast, relative clauses do not undergo lexicalization. This does not mean that they
cannot give rise to names—for instance, we used to refer to the blind Ñatabi as m@l kus@-na
yawus (eye close/ﬁnish-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt father’s.sister) ‘blind father’s sister’, lit. ‘father’s
  1 A reduplicated verb used in a verb-noun compound developed a somewhat idiosyncratic meaning in vya-vya ta:b
(hit+lk-red+lk hand) ‘right hand, lit. hitting hand’. This can be alternatively interpreted as a deverbal nominalization
used as a modiﬁer to another noun (§9.1.1).
480      19 Other Dependent Clausessister whose eyes ﬁnished’, and to a sickly girl in the village as 19.17b. Each of these coinages
is, however, more of an occasionalism than a ﬁxed expression, as is the case with verb-noun
compounds.
   19.3 c lau s e l i n k i n g v i a c a s e m a r k e r ‘ i n s t e a d ’ and suffix ‘ like ’Of all case markers which can attach to verbs only the substitutive case -yæy ‘instead, rather
than, in exchange for’ is uncontroversially used to link clauses. There are two options. If the
case marker attaches to the verbal root, the subject of the dependent clause is the same as that
of a main clause, as in 19.36.
19.36 [m@y-a-mæja:r           yati-yæy] [wali-mæja:r                  wa:r

      knit-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt
      ‘Instead of knitting with real thread (made of tree bark), she has knitted a stringbag with
      wool (lit. white people’s string)’
If the subjects are diﬀerent, the substitutive case marker attaches to the verb inﬂected with
main clause subject marker (in versatile tense). The case marker occupies the second cross-
referencing position. Examples are 19.37 and T3.40.
19.37 [ñ@n       kiya-ñ@na-yæy]                      [d@-k@-m

      kill-hit-fut-2fem.sgsubj.vt-3masc.sgbas.vt
      ‘Instead of you dying, you will kill him’
   In T3.40, the substitutive clause has the meaning ‘in exchange for’ (wun-a-di ñan-ugw vya-
m@na-yæy wun-aba:b aka ya-na-wun-@k (I-lk-pl child-pl kill-2masc.sgsubj.vt+3fem.sgbas.vt-
subst I-too dem.dist.react.top.fem.sg come-act.foc-1fem.sgbas.vt-conf) ‘in exchange for
you killing my children, I too have come here (to kill you)’. Examples of the substitutive case
-yæy as a clause-linking device are rare in texts and in conversations. I have never heard a
negated substitutive clause used; nor are there any examples of negated substitutive clauses in
the corpus.
   Clauses linked with -p@k ‘like’ are not that scarce. We saw in §9.2 that the suﬃx -p@k ‘like’
can be used with most word classes, with somewhat diﬀerent meanings. It is used on a fully
inﬂected verb if one activity or state is compared to another. Examples are at 14.31, 14.33,
19.5, and 19.38–42. In 9.38 and 14.117, -p@k is used on a negated clause, in a slightly diﬀerent
meaning ‘as if’. The use of the dependent clause negator -ma:r- conﬁrms the dependent clause
status of the -p@k clause. There are no restrictions on tense and aspects, or the occurrence of any
main clause complex predicate, in clauses marked with -p@k. Just as in any dependent clause,
uninﬂected verbs require a support verb.

      space be/have-neg.sub-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt-like sit-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt
      ‘She sits (over there) as if there were no space’
A clause marked with -p@k can occur with t@- ‘stand/be/have’ as a support verb, as in 19.39.

      ‘It is this girl (who) is as if she had a child’  In 19.40, a -p@k clause follows an NP argument also marked with -p@k. This shows a
similarity between the -p@k clause and any oblique argument marked with -p@k ‘like’. The
-p@k clause itself occurs in a chain with a completive same-subject clause:19.40 [wun-a-p@k] [a      yi-tua-p@k]                     [r@ka:r@k yu-ku]      ma:y

      ‘Like me, like I went, go having gone carefully’  A -p@k clause can itself be complex: in 19.41 it contains a same-subject completive clause.
In his story about how he and his mates ran away from school when they were little, David
Takendu compared this event to the ﬂight of Jews from Egypt:19.41 [a-di        ju igipt wapa-ku,          tabu-da-l-p@k]

purposive (uninﬂected) and diﬀerent-subject purposive (partially inﬂected)—see §13.4. The
marker of same-subject purposive -Vk and the marker of diﬀerent-subject purposive -k@k (or
-k@k@k, with light verb roots) are similar to the dative case marker -Vk on nouns. The markers
may well be related. However, synchronically speaking, -Vk on nouns behaves diﬀerently from
-Vk on verbs: seemingly the same marker can attach directly to a monosyllabic noun+linker,
while to be used with a monosyllabic verb it requires the root to be reduplicated. So, the
noun s@ ‘name’ and the verb s@- ‘put, plant’ combine with -Vk yielding diﬀerent forms: sa:k
(name+lk+dat) ‘for name’ and s@sa:k (put/plant+red+purp) ‘so that (same subject) puts or
plants’ (also see §2.4).
  Same-subject purposive forms of monosyllabic verbs are homophonous with dative-aversive-
marked nominalization (§9.1.2 and §13.7). They can be easily distinguished by the ways in
which they are negated (see §14.3).
482     19 Other Dependent Clauses  The same-subject purposive marks a purpose complement of any verb if this is semantically
appropriate, indicating that the subject of the matrix verb and that of the purpose-marked verb
are identical—see 7.76, 16.75, T1.8, T1.12, and T1.14. Another example is at 19.43:19.43 [kamna:gw k@ka:k]               [hat t@-na-d]
      food         eat+red+purp.ss hard have/be-act.foc-3masc.sgbas.vt
      ‘It was hard for him to eat food’  Same-subject purposive clauses cannot be negated: the negative pro-clause ma: has to be
used, as in 14.67 and 14.68.
  A purposive clause can precede the main clause, as in 19.43, or follow it, as in 19.44. The
order of constituents depends on pragmatics (see Chapter 20). The second line of 19.44 shows
that a purpose clause can appear with a completive clause as its matrix clause. Their subjects
are the same. And the subject of the completive clause is, in its turn, the same as that of the
main, fully inﬂected clause:19.44 [a-di        ñ@ ab@ti kus@-l@-k]                   [nagw@k

      ‘After those seven days ﬁnished, we will go (to fetch) sago, to wash sago, having killed
      one (pig) again, for (us) to eat’  The matrix clause for a purposive clause can be a relative clause, as in 19.45. The common
argument is the O of the relative clause and a location in the main clause.19.45 [ [wi kur@-k]       kulapu-tua]                       [tami: mi

      dem.dist.react.top.fem.sg already go.up-3plsubj.vt+3fem.sgbas.vt
      ‘(In) the area which I cleaned to make a house trees have already grown’  Diﬀerent-subject purposive forms are partially inﬂected, exactly like other diﬀerent-subject
forms. A diﬀerent-subject purposive clause can precede or follow the main clause—see 13.51,
13.55, and 19.46.19.46 [l@ k@ka-n-aka                                       ga:m

      plant-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt eel come-3fem.sg-purp.ds
      ‘She here is calling, so that the eel should come’  A matrix clause for a diﬀerent-subject purposive clause can be a dependent clause, as in
13.49 where it is employed as a complementation strategy. We return to this in §19.8.
  Diﬀerent-subject purposive clauses are negated with a dependent clause negator -ma:r- (see
14.71), unlike same-subject purposive clauses. This is a crucial diﬀerence between same-subject
and diﬀerent-subject purposive clauses (see §13.4.3).
                                                19.4 Purposive and desiderative clauses        483                                19.4.2 Desiderative clausesA desiderative form in a dependent clause always requires the same subject as that of the main
clause. Similarly to the same-subject purposive, desiderative is an uninﬂected verb. Desiderative
can express purpose, as in 12.62, 13.57–8, 19.47, 19.102, and T3.45. While the same-subject
purposive would have implied deﬁnite intention, the desiderative indicates a certain insecurity.
The desire expressed in 19.47 does not mean that the expedition will eventuate:19.47 [kapayawi-k      yi-k@r] [war-na]
      sweet.potato-dat go-des go.up-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt
      ‘She has come up (into the house) wanting to go and get sweet potatoes’   We will see in §19.8 that desiderative clauses are used as complementation strategies with
verbs of negative desire, such as ‘be unwilling’ (in 19.102). Manambu has no verb meaning
‘want’. The idea of wanting something is most frequently expressed as a speech report (using
the verb wa- ‘say’) accompanied with a desiderative clause (this is also the case in many
other languages of New Guinea and Australia: see Aikhenvald 2008, for discussion and
references).
   Unlike purposive clauses, desiderative clauses always have to be preposed to the main clause.
If they appear postposed, they typically form an independent clause juxtaposed to another
main clause. A short pause indicates a clause boundary in 19.48:19.48 [mæy        yi-t@k]        [pause] [ka:m        k@-k@r] [v@-tua]

      [ka:m       samasa:m ra:d]
      breadfruit a.lot        sit+3masc.sgbas.vt
      ‘Come, let’s go, (I) want to eat breadfruit, I saw there is a lot of breadfruit’  Just like purposive clauses, desideratives can be used within dependent clauses, as in T3.45.
Neither purposives nor desideratives can head the predicate of a verbless clause. Desiderative
in dependent clauses cannot be negated—if they have to be, a desiderative clause has to be
rephrased as a main clause, which may be cast as a speech report.
  A comparison of purposive and desiderative clauses is given in Table 19.3.
  Dative-aversive-marked nominalizations can also be used to express purpose and have the
implications of same subject (see, for instance, T2.8: ‘to wash sago’). Their syntactic and
semantic properties are considered in §13.7. Similarly to purposive and desiderative clauses,Table 19.3 Purposive and desiderative clauses Properties                Purposive (DS)           Purposive (SS)           Desiderative (SS) 1.

the basic meanings of the dative-aversive case—see §19.8.
                                  19.5 s p e e c h r e p o rt s                19.5.1 Speech report constructions and their propertiesSpeech reports are by far the most frequent clause type in Manambu discourse, and especially
in conversations. Even the small textual sample at the end of this grammar contains speech
reports in just about every third sentence.
   Speech reports are extremely versatile: besides reporting actual speech events, they are
employed to express internal speech and thought, desire and intention of third person, reason
and purpose, and a few other related meanings. Multifunctional speech reports are a feature
Manambu shares with a number of Papuan languages: speech reports often express thinking,
desire, intention, and cognition. See Aikhenvald (2008) for an overview, and a summary of
typological parameters relevant for the analysis of speech reports.
   Manambu has three verbs of speech—bla- (allomorph b@l-) ‘say/tell (something)’, yi- ‘say X,
speak (a language)’, and wa- ‘say, tell’. Of these, only the verb wa- occurs with speech reports
of any kind. The verb yi- occurs with just a few interjections as speech reports, as in ay yi-da-d
(interj say-3plsubj.vt-3masc.sgbas.vt) ‘they shouted’ (lit. they said ay) (T1.29). A comparison
of the three verbs of speech in terms of their further properties is in §21.1.3 (Table 21.1).
   Speech reports in Manambu are multiclausal (Manambu has no reported evidentials).
Speech reports can be coextensive with a clause, or a sentence. They may be less than a clause,
containing just a vocative, as in 19.49, or an interjection, as in 19.50:
19.49 [gra-n] [ata wa-na]                    [wun-a      ñan-eee]
      cry-seq then say-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt I-lk+fem.sg child-voc
      ‘She said crying: ‘Oh my chiiiild!’
19.50 [ [mm] wa-ku]       [ada                          ya:d]
      interj say-compl:ss dem.dist.react.top+masc.sg go+3masc.sgbas.p
      ‘Having said “mm” (an “up-to-no-good” interjection), he went oﬀ’
   Or they may consist of several sentences, as in T2.40, and T3.22–5. Speech reports can be
discontinuous—as in T1.33. Discontinuity only occurs on clause boundaries.
   Speech reports do not have any special segmental markers other than the verb of speech itself
in a framing clause. There is an optional pause between the speech report and the preceding
framing clause. Speech reports do not have the falling intonation contour of medial clauses, or
the rising contour of juxtaposed clauses.
   Speech reports can precede or follow the framing clause containing the speech verb, with a
slight preference for the former. Clear examples of speech reports preceding the framing clause
are at T1.4, T1.11, T1.12, T1.16, T1.22, T1.24, T1.28, T2.5, T2.27, T3.8, T3.13, T3.16, T3.37,
T3.40–1, T3.44, T3.47, and T3.50. Clear examples of speech reports following the framing
clause are at T1.8, T1.13, T1.18, T1.19, T1.21, T1.23, T1.24, T1.26, T1.28, T2.40, T2.57, T2.58,
T3.22, and T3.41. If a speech report follows the framing clause, another framing clause is often
added at the end of the speech report. This is frequently cast as a medial clause—as in T1.33
and T2.7. This results in what looks like a speech framing construction: ‘they said [Speech
Report] having said’. A similar example is at 19.51. The speech report is in curly brackets, and
the framing verb of speech is underlined:

  A speech report can itself contain a speech report. Examples are at T1.33 (where the main
character is quoting what he himself had said prior to going oﬀ to ﬁght the moon), and T3.43.
  We will now discuss further properties of speech reports in Manambu, including direct
speech reports (§19.5.2), reported commands as indirect speech reports (§19.5.3), and semi-
direct speech reports (§19.5.4). The syntactic role of speech reports is addressed at §19.5.5.
Polysemous patterns in speech reports are analysed in §19.5.6.","[505, 506, 507, 508, 509, 510, 511, 512]"

        4.1.2 Semantically and grammatically determined subclasses of nounsNouns fall into several grammatical subclasses according to their morphological possibilities
which correlate with semantic properties of their referents. These classes may overlap. As a
result, a noun can belong to more than one class.
   Nouns with animate and with inanimate referents diﬀer in the principles of gender assign-
ment. The gender assignment of animate nouns is by sex and also by shape and size of the
referent. In the gender assignment of inanimate nouns shape, size, and some other parameters
(such as degree and quantity) play a role. The semantics of genders distinguishes mass and
74     4 Word Classescount nouns—see §5.2. Vocatives are typically formed on nouns with an animate referent and
on personal names. These restrictions are tendencies rather than steadfast rules: any noun
referring to an addressee, if called, or spoken to, can acquire a vocative form, e.g. bal-a (pig-
voc) ‘oh pig!’, amæy-a ‘oh mother!’ Vocatives never form part of a clause, and are separated
from the clause by a pause (see §2.7 on the speciﬁc vocative intonation and vowel lengthening).
   Body part and orientation terms—such as ya:l ‘belly’, mutam ‘face’, ma:l ‘side’, ñ@d
‘middle’—diﬀer from other nouns in that they appear in part–whole possessive constructions
(see §8.1), e.g. yala-wi (belly+lk-house) ‘inside the house’.
   Inherently locational nouns, e.g. tami: ‘area’, ñab ‘the Sepik River’, may occur unmarked
for locative or directional case (see Chapter 7). The body part noun ya:l ‘belly, stomach’
behaves as an inherently locational noun with respect to human referents: siblings or twins
are often referred to as those who ya:l n@ waku-b@r (belly one go.out-3dubas.p) ‘came from one
belly’. Place names can also be unmarked for locative case, as in 4.1:
4.1 Swakap yi-dana
    Swakap go-3plsubj.vt+3fem.sgbas.vt
    ‘They went to Swakap’
Nouns referring to means of transport take the ‘transportative’ cases -Vsay and -Vsap, e.g.
val-a-say, val-a-sap (canoe-lk-transp) ‘by canoe’ (§7.7).
   Inherently temporal nouns refer exclusively to time spans and are often unmarked for
case (cf. §7.2 and §21.2.1), e.g. n@b@l ‘today’; s@r ‘tomorrow’. Temporal nouns form locative,
terminative, dative, and comitative cases, and can be modiﬁed by a numeral, e.g. jayib nak
(moment one) ‘one moment’ (unlike adverbs). Examples 4.2–4 illustrate case marking on
temporal nouns. A noun marked with the locative case refers to a deﬁned point in time
(4.4), while an unmarked temporal noun refers to the stretch of time (4.3). Along similar
lines, nag@s means ‘the day before yesterday’, and nag@s-@-b (the.day.before.yesterday-lk-term)
means ‘lately, exactly up until recently’).
4.2 s@r-a:k              kamna:gw-a
    tomorrow-lk+dat food-3fem.sgnom
    ‘This is the food for tomorrow’
4.3 n@b@l væra-k-na-di
    today come.back-fut-act.foc-3plbas.vt
    ‘They will come back today (any time today)’
4.4 n@b@l-a:m      væra-k-na-di
    today-lk+loc come.back-fut-act.foc-3plbas.vt
    ‘They will come back later on today (that is, a part of today which is later than now)’
   Temporal nouns are less noun-like than prototypical nouns because they cannot be modiﬁed
by adjectives, or be possessors or possessees in possessive NPs. Similarly to other nouns, tem-
poral nouns may form coordinate compounds, e.g. s@r-mu: (tomorrow-the.day.after.tomorrow)
means ‘within the next few days’. Just like other nouns, they can be coordinated using the
comitative, e.g. s@r-a-wa mu: (tomorrow-lk-com day.after.tomorrow) ‘tomorrow and the day
after’.
   A small set of non-inflecting nouns which take no case marking are mostly loans, e.g. lotu
‘church’, stori ‘talking’ (from Tok Pisin lotu, stori), e.g. stori r@-na-dian (talking sit-act.foc-
1plbas.vt) ‘we sit talking’, lotu ma: r@ (church neg sit:neg) ‘(he) does not go to church’.
Two nouns with generic reference, m@wi ‘things like that’ and ma:gw ‘whatsitsname, what-
ever’ (see A.III in §20.1.1 and §21.3.1), stand apart from other nouns because of their semantics.
                                                                                               4.1 Nouns           75The noun ma:gw can replace any noun if the speaker does not recall the exact term. (The
general verb m@gi- ‘do whatever’ is related to this: §21.3.2.) The generic noun m@wi is unusual
in that it follows a noun it modiﬁes (all other noun and adjective modiﬁers are preposed to
the head noun), as in yawi m@wi (work things.like.this) ‘work and other things of that nature;
things like work’, wi m@wi ‘things like houses’. This position is similar to that of quantiﬁers
and numerals (§§10.5–6).
   Kinship nouns form a closed subset. They always have a human referent. Some have a
ﬁxed gender: ñaj ‘paternal uncle’ and awa:y ‘maternal uncle’ are always masculine, and amæy
‘mother’ and yawus ‘paternal aunt’ are always feminine. Others have variable gender, e.g. ma:m
‘elder sibling’ and ñamus (or ñam@s) ‘younger sibling’. Only kinship terms have an obligatory
overt number marking (§6.1).
   Personal names are a culturally salient subclass (see §1.3.2, §21.5.4). These always have a
human or an important referent, and a ﬁxed gender. As demonstrated by Harrison (1990a),
names are conceived of as valued possessions of a clan, and using a name belonging to another
clan is tantamount to stealing property.
   Names cannot be pluralized, or occur as heads of possessive NPs. They have speciﬁc sets
of gender-sensitive derivational aﬃxes (see §5.3). They occur as postnominal modiﬁers in
appositional NPs (see §20.1.1, on the noun phrase structure), e.g. wun-a ma:m Pak@nab@r (I-
lk+fem.sg older.sibling name) ‘my elder sibling Pak@nab@r’; and can form associative plural
(§6.2.2). Any object considered a totem of a clan or of a subclan can be used as a personal name.
This is why names constitute a potentially open class and also overlap with terms of address.
Nowadays, names from Tok Pisin and English are making their way into the language—e.g.
J@m@s ‘James’, Jemima (pronounced as [Jemi""ma]), Paulina ‘Pauline’, Pol ‘Paul’. They have the
same syntactic properties as the original Manambu names. Most nouns or even noun phrases
can be used as personal names, e.g. Saun ‘white pelican; female name’, Gwarabi ‘mango; male
and female name’, Ñ@d-@-wi (middle-lk-house) ‘middle of the house; female name’. When used
as such, they share all other properties of personal names.
   Terms of address (Manambu way@pi or way, wa:y) are a typologically unusual subclass of
nouns. In the Manambu tradition, every clan possesses a set of terms for culturally important
objects, alongside the clan’s ‘own’ personal names. Natural objects, ﬂora, and fauna are also
divided between clans as their totems. The names of entities and objects which belong to a
particular clan are used for addressing and farewelling members of this clan (see Harrison
1990a: 76–7). It is considered proper style to address and farewell a person using address terms
and totems of their father’s and of their mother’s clans. Address forms are widely used in
traditional song genres (laments namay and sui, and mourning songs gra-kudi).
   For instance, saun ‘white pelican’ is a totem of the Maliau clan, and m@d ‘cassowary’ is a
totem of the Sarak clan. Consequently, when addressing (especially when greeting) someone
belonging to the Maliau clan, one can address them as saun, and when addressing a person
from the Sarak clan one can address them as m@d.The moon is a totem for the clan of Ñakau,
and so anyone belonging to this clan can be addressed as bap ‘moon’. Since crotons are a totem
of their clan, every Yimal clan member can be addressed as b@utag@r ‘croton’. 3
   In addition to the names of totems, each clan has a set of their own address-only terms.
Some can be identiﬁed as lexical items referring to totems: so, apwi, an address term for
someone from the Sarak clan, is also a ‘shadowy style’ word for cassowary (see §22.3).
Others do not appear to have any identiﬁable lexical source (at least within the Manambu
language).","[100, 101, 102]"
" 4 This category also includes terms for people from areas of Papua New Guinea other than the Sepik area, e.g.
m@g-a lap (unripe-lk banana) for the Tolai, and bal (pig) for Highlanders.
                                                  22.6 Incipient language obsolescence       619   Manambu purists go even further in suggesting lexically ‘pure’ innovations covering edu-
cational, ﬁnancial, and religious terminology, e.g. suku-mawul (carve-insides) ‘patience, that
is, the mindset of a carver’, kalipa-d@ du (teach-3masc.sg man) ‘male teacher’, sa:n warapwi-
dana tamiy (money change-3pl area) ‘stock exchange’, du-awa kwa-mar-na ta:kw (man-com
lie-neg.sub-pres+3fem.sg woman, lit. ‘woman who does not lie with men’) ‘virgin’, God ma:j
krayin kalpa-di (God speech carry+seq teach-3plbas.vt, lit. ‘teachers carrying God’s speech’)
‘disciples’, and even N@ma-d@ Du (big-masc.sg man) ‘The Christian God’.
   It is too early to evaluate the eﬀects of language engineering by this group of purists.
Conservative attitudes toward loanwords are known to have hampered eﬀorts to maintain
endangered languages; ‘unrealistically severe older-speaker purism can discourage younger
speakers’ (Dorian 1994; similar points were raised by Hill and Hill 1986: 140–1). And Hamp
(1989) suggested that if a minority language survives next to a larger dominant language, it has
to allow for a certain amount of borrowing of morphemes. On the other hand, some degree of
purism may stop otherwise unlimited borrowing and code-switching with Tok Pisin.
   There appears to be a certain amount of language consciousness and resistance to borrow-
ings among some young villagers. One of the urban Manambu, when she visited Malu village,
asked a 10-year-old boy to tie her canoe for her, using a Tok Pisin verb pas ‘be closed, stuck’:
22.38 val     a-pas
      canoe impv-tie
      ‘Tie the canoe!’
  The boy corrected her, saying:
22.39 a-pas    ma: atawtak      aw
      impv-tie neg impv+tie+put impv+say
      ‘Not “apas”, say “tie” ’
   Since this urban Manambu is known to be a purist and an authority on Manambu culture,
the boy could have just been trying to get his own back, demonstrating that he knows enough
to correct the ‘authority’. But opportunities like this no doubt enhance the language awareness
of speakers.
   We now turn to the eﬀects of language obsolescence, and the perspectives for the survival of
the language in its current setting.

guages very often lies not in the sorts of change, which are often the same. Rather, it lies
in the quantity of change, and in the speed with which the obsolescent language changes
(see Aikhenvald 2002a: 243–60; 2004b). Language obsolescence frequently entails a general
breakdown in language structure resulting in allophonic and morphological variation, regu-
larization, and even new allomorphs. Stylistic, rhetorical, and expressive loss in language shift
results in lexical and even in grammatical reduction (cf. Woodbury 1998).
   As we saw in Chapter 1, outside the domestic environment, Manambu is used in ritual
discourse, and sometimes in village- or clan-level meetings. Even then, it is often replaced
620       22 Genetic and Areal Relationshipswith Tok Pisin, or English, and just about always appears interspersed with Tok Pisin and
English code-switches.
   The types of changes observed in modern Manambu follow the general principles of change
in language obsolescence summarized by Campbell and Muntzel (1989), Dixon (1991), Sasse
(1992), and Aikhenvald (2002a: 243–60). Variability of phonological processes is a sign
of language disintegration. The process of rhotic dissimilation (§2.6, A1) is violated by urban
speakers of Manambu, as well as those villagers whose major language of communication
within their homes is Tok Pisin.
   New morphological variability, a frequent consequence of language obsolescence, has
been noticed for kinship terms which have overt number markers (§6.1). Younger speakers
whose knowledge of the kinship system appears to be incomplete freely oscillate between such
forms as sg. ñap, pl. ñap-a-b@r, ñap-agw ‘mother’s elder sister’; sg. ñasap, pl. ñasap-b@r, ñasap-
agw ‘father’s elder brother’; sg. gwal, pl. gwalugw-b@r, gwal-ugw ‘grandchild, father’s father’; sg.
babay, pl. babay-b@r, babay-ugw ‘mother’s parent’, and a few others. In one case double plural
marking was given as an alternative: sg. ma:m, pl. mam-@gw, mam-ugw-b@r ‘elder sibling’. The
lack of confusion in marking dual on kinship terms is due to an obvious link between the dual
marker -v@ti and the number ‘2’ (viti). Not so for the irregular dual of ñan ‘child’, ñ@di (plural
ñanugw). Younger speakers regularize this form, by adding -v@ti ‘dual, two’ to it: ñ@di-v@ti, lit.
‘child:du-two’ ‘two children’. Older and more traditional speakers frown at this.
   Stylistic reduction and obsolescence of traditional knowledge aﬀects the frequency of num-
ber marking. The archaic plurals takwa:gw (woman/wife+pl) ‘women’, from ta:kw ‘woman,
wife’, lanugw ‘husbands’ (la:n ‘husband’), and tidigw (ti:d ‘co-wife, woman of same generation’)
‘co-wives’ only occur in namai ‘foiled love songs’; and they are not known to younger people
(or people who have lived outside the Manambu-speaking area for a long time). Non-kinship
terms which contain the plural marker -@gw tend to fall into disuse. Speakers who speak more
Tok Pisin than Manambu tend not to use some sequencing forms, such as -taka ‘immediate
sequence’, or -ga:y ‘conditional’.
   Dialect mixing and dialect levelling is another feature of obsolescent languages. When a
language becomes restricted in its use, speakers often spontaneously mix forms from what were
previously distinct dialects, without realizing that they belong to diﬀerent linguistic systems.
Sometimes speakers may not even be able to tell which form comes from which dialect.
   In the Manambu context, dialect mixture is reinforced by the mobility of speakers. In
particular, those Manambu who live in towns freely mix with each other, and often ‘pick up’
one another’s speech habits. Dialect variation in the Manambu-speaking communities is not
great. The language is spoken in ﬁve villages; of these, Yawabak is considered an ‘extension’
of Avatip, and there are hardly any diﬀerences; similarly, Apa:n is an ‘extension’ of Malu.
Yuanab (or Yambon) stands apart. In spite of being further away from the government station
Ambunti, it has always been more open to outside inﬂuences than the other villages. It appears
to have had a strong inﬂux of Iatmul migrants and Iatmul inﬂuence (see discussion by Harrison
1990a), and also perhaps some Gala substratum (according to Paul Badaibæg Kat). Yuanab
was the only Manambu village to have welcomed SIL missionaries in the early 1960s. 5
   The Yuanab dialect has a number of marked diﬀerences from Avatip and Malu. One diﬀer-
ence between this and other varieties lies in the r/l distinction: the Yuanab variety does not
distinguish r and l (that is, l in other Manambu varieties corresponds to r); so Ñaula ‘Iatmul’ is
pronounced as [ÑauRa]; and salyak@n ‘stretching out’ comes out as [saRyak@n]. This diﬀerence   5 Most Manambu speakers maintain that a major drawback of the ﬁrst version of the Bible in Manambu, published
in 1979, was its bias towards the Yuanab variety; the revision of the translation is currently in progress.
                                                     22.6 Incipient language obsolescence         621is the only one that appears to be consistently maintained; and is also held to be emblematic
for those who come from Yambon. However, in the speech of the Yuanab Manambu who
live outside the Manambu-speaking villages area the two sounds r and l tend to become
allophones in free variation. There used to be minor lexical and grammatical diﬀerences, which
are nowadays diﬃcult to retrieve. For instance, the word for ‘dark’ is gRa-g@R (black+lk-black)
in Yuanab, and gla-ka-g@l (black+lk-int-black) in the Avatip and Malu varieties; in actual fact
one hears both forms in Avatip and in Malu.
   The varieties spoken in Malu and in Avatip are very similar; minor lexical diﬀerences include:   r Avatip ba:g, Malu ar@ p ‘bush knife’;
   r Avatip saku, Malu sapwi ‘give birth’;
   r Avatip ya:l b@ r@ p@-na (belly already be.full/enough-pres+3fem.sgbas), Malu ya:l b@ kap@-
    na (belly already full-act.foc+3fem.sgbas) ‘(I) am full’. An alternative expression in Avatip
    is ya:l b@ wapruk@-na (belly already overﬂow/overfull-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt) ‘I am very
    full indeed’.","[645, 646, 647, 648]"

 14.1.3 Contiguity in non-future negative constructions, and the scope of negationIn future negative constructions, the verb and the negator are always contiguous, and form one
phonological word. In non-future negative constructions, contiguity is not required. Then the
order of the negator and the verb cannot be reversed: the negator has to precede the negative
verb.
  The only form which obligatorily intervenes between the negator and the negated verb is the
adverb n@bay ‘yet, already’, as in 14.20. Any other order is ungrammatical (see 14.20a).
14.20 d@ ma: n@bay yæy
      he neg yet     come.neg
      ‘He has not come yet’
14.20a?? ∗ d@ n@bay ma: yæy
         he yet     neg come.neg
         ‘He has not come yet’—???
  The following types of constituents may intervene between the negator and the negative verb
form. The eﬀect is focusing on the intervening constituent. As mentioned in §20.3, individual
constituents hardly ever occur in highlighting focus in negative constructions. Changing their
position in a clause is one way of focusing them.
1. The adjective yara ‘well, ﬁne’ used adverbially can intervene between the negator and the
negated verb, as in 14.21a where ‘well’ is in focus.
14.21a wun ma: yara la:kw
       I     neg well know.neg
       ‘I do not know (this) well (contrary to what you may expect)’
304     14 Negation  In 14.21b, ‘well’ is not in focus:
14.21b wun yara ma: la:kw
       I     well neg know.neg
       ‘I do not know (this) well’2. The object can intervene between the negator and the negated verb, as in 14.22–3, with the
object in highlighting focus:
14.22 man-ta:b ma: ap             t@
      foot-hand neg bone/force have.neg
      ‘(His) hands and feet had no strength’
14.23 k@ta wun ma: br@-k@-m          wuk@mar
      now I     neg 3du-obl-acc forget.neg
      ‘Now I haven’t forgotten these two (white people) (despite the fact that we lost touch)’
3. The copula complement can intervene between the negator and the negated verb. In 14.24,
the narrator stresses that people and apawul spirits are not friendly because of a number of
misunderstandings—in contrast, they fear each other:
14.24 al@k        ñan-awa       ma: kapawi t@
      this.is.why we-lk+com neg friend be.neg
      ‘This is why (they) are not friends with us (they are scared of us)
4. The subject can intervene between the negator and the verb. An example of the A of t@-
‘have’ is at 14.25—this is what a speaker said about her siblings:
14.25 takwa-d@ka        du-a-ma:gw       ma: ñan t@
      woman+lk-only man-lk-’thing’ neg we have.neg
      ‘(We are) just women, we (in contrast to others) do not have brothers’
  In 14.26, gu ‘water’, in the S function, intervenes between the negator and the verb:
14.26 ma: gu     r@
      neg water sit.neg
      ‘There was no water (in contrast to what was expected)’
5. An oblique in a locative, or an allative case, can intervene between the negator and the verb,
as in 14.27–8, and T3.14:
14.27 [yæj         k@-na-wur               t@n@b-a:m          r@-na]
      frying.pan dem.prox-curr.rel-up ﬁreplace-lk+loc sit-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt
      [ma: wiya:m             r@]
      neg house+lk+loc sit.neg
      ‘The frying pan is up there (in previously mentioned location) on the ﬁreplace, it was
      sitting in the house (contrary to what the character expected)’
14.28 ma: ña:r           krakw
      neg sun+lk+all take+outside
      ‘(The two brothers) did not take (their new sister) out into the sun’ (contrary to what
      would be expected)
6. A part of complex predicate marked with the sequential -n (see §17.1.1 and §16.2.3) can
intervene between the negator and a posture verb, as a means of focusing on the lexical verb:
                                                  14.1 Declarative non-habitual clauses       30514.29 ñan [Malu kwa-na                          nagw@m]         ma: væn       r@
      we Malu stay-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt sago+lk+acc neg see+seq sit+neg
      ‘We did not sit watching the sago that was staying at the Malu village’
   Examples like 14.21–9 are common to all generations of speakers of all levels of proﬁciency.
In most such cases, the intervening word does not exceed two syllables. An exception is at
14.24—but note that it comes from a story by an elderly man who was trying his best to be as
elaborate as possible.
   Only highly elaborate speakers allow a whole clause to intervene between the negator and
the verb. Examples are at 14.30 and 14.31.
14.30 a-d@               a:s ma: [ya:n        br@-k@-k      ma:k] ta:k
      dem.dist-masc.sg dog neg come+seq 3du-obl-dat face put.neg
      ‘That dog did not show his face by coming to them two’ (contrary to what they expected)
  In 14.31, two constituents intervene between the negator and the negated verb—the adverb
n@bay (for which this is the only possible position) is placed close to the negator, and followed
by a dependent clause ‘like I stay’. The spirit of a dead woman refuses to give her living husband
the food she eats in the world of the dead:
14.31 m@n-a:k            k@-di         kami: a-di        kwa:y kwatiya              ma:,
      2masc.sg-lk+dat dem.prox-pl ﬁsh dem.dist-pl shrimp give.to.nonthird.p neg
      m@n        [ma: n@bay [wun kwa-tua-p@k]                          ku]
      you.masc neg yet        I     stay-1sgsubj.vt+3fem.sgbas.vt-like stay.neg
      ‘I won’t give you these ﬁsh, those shrimp, you are not yet in the same state as I am
      (contrary to what you may think)’
   There is an intonation break between ma: n@bay ‘not yet’ and the rest. This is not surprising:
ma: n@bay behaves like a ﬁxed expression.
   If a multiword complex predicate consists of an inﬂected auxiliary and an uninﬂected part
(see Chapter 17), the uninﬂected part of the complex predicate intervenes between the negator
and the inﬂected part. This is shown in 14.32.
14.32 d@ væy ma: warya-n            t@
      he spear neg quarrel/ﬁght-seq have+neg
      ‘He hadn’t fought with spear’
   To focus the uninﬂected part of the complex predicate, this has to be preposed to the negator.
Note that the uninﬂected part of the complex predicate cannot follow the negative form of the
auxiliary—this is in contrast to uninﬂected verbs which are not part of complex predicates
(§17.1–2). In 14.33, the speaker focuses on the fact that she had never ever seen European-type
long hair (she had heard of this, but this was her ﬁrst-time visual experience):
14.33 wun tala:b væ-n ma: t@                 nab [ñ@n-a
      I     before see-seq neg have.neg hair you.fem-3fem.sgnom
      t@-na-p@k]
      have-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt-like
      ‘I have never before seen hair like you have’
  Complex predicates consisting of a nominal and a verb are negated just like other complex
predicates in 14.32: the whole complex predicate follows the negator, as in 14.34–5:
306     14 Negation14.34 wun ma: s@kul@k y@
      I     neg cooking do/go
      ‘I didn’t do the cooking’
14.35 wun k@            t@pa:m              ma: j@b@ kwa:r
      I     dem.prox village+lk+loc neg image do/get+neg
      ‘I didn’t learn to write (lit. get image) in this village’
   The position of negator and the eﬀect of reversing the order of the nominal, or the
dependent-marked verb, and the negated verb help diﬀerentiate superﬁcially similar complex
verbs containing auxiliaries (as in 14.33–5) and sequencing structures (as in 14.29).
   In none of the examples discussed above does the change in the position of the negator
aﬀect the scope: the negator consistently has the whole clause within its scope. There is just
one exception. The adverb m@yir appears to be unique in that the scope of negation diﬀers
depending on its position in a clause. In 14.36, m@yir ‘really’ precedes the negator, and the verb
is within the scope of negation.
14.36 a-di        ma:j n@k@-di du-ta:kw         m@yir ma: la:kw
      dem.dist-pl story other-pl man-woman really neg know.neg
      ‘Other people really do not know those stories’
  In 14.37, this same adverb intervenes between the negator and the verb. Either the verb or
the adverb can be understood as being within the negator’s scope. The ambiguity is resolved
by context.
14.37 a-di          ma:j n@k@-di du-ta:kw     ma: m@yir la:kw
      dem.dist-pl story other-pl man-woman neg really know.neg
      ‘Other people do not really know those stories’ or ‘Other people really do not know
      those stories’
  Manambu has no negative pronouns. The numeral ‘one’ in its indeﬁnite meaning is used in
negative clauses, meaning ‘not one’, as in 12.7 (nak-a:b@ ma: y@ (one-too neg go) ‘not one
escapes’), and T3.14 where the form nakam@y ‘single one (feminine)’ is used.
  If a constituent other than the predicate is to be negated, it has to form an independent non-
verbal clause negated by ma:. To say ‘not only in Avatip’ one literally says ‘only in Avatip—no’,
as in 14.38. The non-verbal negative clause is in square brackets.
14.38 n@b@l wun-a-d@        t@p-a:m        Apat@p-a:m         [wun-a-d@        t@p-a-d@ka

      ‘Now in my village, Avatip, not only in my village, (lit. only in my village—no), in our
      three or four Manambu villages, there are two roads by which we keep going round’
  A negative non-verbal clause can occupy the same position as a noun phrase. For instance,
the word for ‘bald’ is nab ma: t@- (hair neg have). How this term was used is shown in 14.39
(an example of the argument elaboration construction: §6.2.3). That ma: ‘negator’ forms one
constituent with nab ‘hair’ and not with the verb t@- ‘have’ is evident from the form of the
                                                      14.2 Negation of habitual clauses       307verb: it is inﬂected as a positive, and not as a negative verb. A negative form of t@- is shown
in 14.40—this sentence was used to describe a girl who is not bald, but whose hair had been
shaved because of lice. (Constituency is indicated with square brackets.)
14.39 [an    Bob wuk@n] [nab ma:] t@-na-bran
      we.two Bob together hair neg have-act.foc-1dubas.vt
      ‘We two, Bob and I, are bald’ (lit. we have there-is-no hair)
14.40 nab [ma: t@]
      hair neg have.neg
      ‘She has no hair’
  Negating one constituent as a separate non-verbal clause produces the eﬀect of strong
contrast. One sister is saying to the other: ‘We two will eat that sago with coconut’, and the
younger sister replies 14.41:
14.41 ka!                    t@p-a:wa           ma:, bal-awa
      dem.prox+3fem.sgnom coconut-lk+com neg pig-lk+com
      k@-k@-ta
      eat-fut-1dusubj.vt+3fem.sgbas.vt
      ‘ “That? (meaning: no way!), not with coconut, we will eat (sago) with pork!” ’
   A similar example is at 10.145 (‘few, not many, few people went down (river)’).
   As we will see in §14.6, the negator ma:—unlike any other negator—can be used as a
complement of the verb wa- ‘say’ with the meaning of ‘forbid, negate, refuse’. This is illustrated
in 9.5, 13.78, and 14.42. In such constructions the verb wa- remains inﬂected as required. The
second occurrence of ‘say no’ is negated in the last line of 14.42.
14.42 alaku                          [ma: wa-k-na-b@r],               wun-a:k

      get.ﬁre-red-dat no, impv+go.out they.two neg say.neg neg
      ‘ “Across there they will refuse (say no) to me getting ﬁre.” “No, go out, they won’t
      refuse” ’
 This example also illustrates another usage of ma:—that of a general negative pro-clause.
We return to this in §14.6. Inherently negative lexemes (see §14.6) co-occur with clausal negator
ma:. They do not have the same scope eﬀects as does ma:. Neither do other negators.
                        14.2 ne gat i o n o f h a b i t ua l c lau s e sHabitual clauses (which require the verb in habitual aspect marked with the suﬃx -kwa-
‘present’, -yikwa- ‘past’: see §12.3) are negated with the negator ak@s which occurs with the
verb in habitual aspect (marked with the suﬃx -kwa-). Unlike the general negator, ak@s co-
occurs with fully inﬂected verbs, as in 14.43–4, 10.5, and 10.60. The negative habitual refers to
what is typically not done.
14.43 ñ@n      ak@s       k@-kus@-kwa-na-ñ@n
      you.fem neg.hab eat-ﬁnish-hab-act.foc-2fem.sgbas.vt
      ‘You never eat (things) up’
308     14 NegationThe copula t@- is obligatorily used to express a habitual non-occurrence involving a non-verbal
predicate head:
14.44 yabi:b ak@s      kuprap t@-kwa-na-di
      quickly neg.hab bad      stay-hab-act.foc-3plbas.vt
      ‘They do not become bad quickly’
  We can recall, from §4.2.2, that the verb kui- ‘give to third person’ is quite unusual in that it
has two alternative forms of the negative habitual. Unlike other verbs in the language, it does
not have to take the suﬃx -yikwa- ‘past habitual’ in the past negative form. Two options are
thus available for ‘give’ in past habitual; there is no semantic diﬀerence between the two. The
regular form, kui-kwa- ‘(not) give habitually’, is shown in 4.37 and 14.45:
14.45 ak@s     kui-yikwa-l                           d@-k@        ta:kw
      neg.hab give.to.third.p-hab.past-3fem.sgbas.p he-obl+fem.sg wife
      ‘She never used to give (them food), his wife’
   The alternative non-habitual declarative form, kui-, with the habitual negator ak@s, is shown
in 4.38 and 14.46. Within the same story, 14.45 and 14.46 follow each other.
14.46 ñaj             ta:kw kuprap-al          ak@s       kui-d
      paternal.uncle wife bad-3fem.sgnom neg.hab give.to.third.p-3masc.sgbas.p
      ‘Paternal uncle’s wife was bad, she never gave (children food)’
   A negative construction containing the negator ak@s and an inﬂected verb forms two gram-
matical and two phonological words. A habitual negative construction with ak@s does not have
to be contiguous. In 9.21 the copula complement precedes the construction of ak@s followed
by an inﬂected verb, and in 14.44 the copula complement is positioned between the negator
and the inﬂected verb. The eﬀect of inserting a constituent between ak@s and the inﬂected
verb is essentially the same as that in constructions with the non-future negative structures
involving the declarative non-habitual negator ma: (see §14.1.3 above): the inserted constituent
is in highlighting focus.
   In fact, any constituent, except for subject or object, can intervene between ak@s and the
inﬂected verb. In 14.47 gus ‘paddle’ is part of a complex predicate involving a typical instrument
(see §7.2).
14.47 wun ak@s        gus  ka-kwa-na-wun
      I     neg.hab paddle paddle/row-hab-act.foc-1fem.sgbas.vt
      ‘I never paddle’
In 14.48, a series of dependent clauses intervenes between the negator and the inﬂected verb:
these clauses contain information which is contrary to what is expected of the river-dwellers:

occur with n@bay ‘yet’. An anterior complex predicate involving the habitual form copula t@-
and a sequential form of a verb is preceded by ak@s as shown in 14.49 (a non-habitual negated
anterior complex predicate is at 14.32). Any alternative ordering of ak@s and the inﬂected verb
in such structures appears contrived.

      antibiotic neg.hab do/get-seq have-hab-act.foc-1sgbas.vt
      ‘I have never been taking antibiotics’
   The negators ma: and ak@s share some similarities in terms of contiguity in negative con-
structions; but are not identical in their properties. Unlike ma:, the negator ak@s is not used
to negate non-verbs on their own—that is, without a copula (see 14.44). Consequently, it is
not used to negate a nominal constituent in the way ma: is employed (see 14.41). Neither is it
used as a complement of the verb wa- ‘say’. The negator ak@s can be used elliptically, meaning
‘never’: in its second occurrence in 14.50, ‘never’ is an elliptic clause recapitulating the previous
clause:
14.50 [l@ ñan-a-k@               kwa:s ak@s     yak@-sada-kwa-na-b@r]

      ‘This salt of ours they would never throw (into their food), never, never ever would they
      throw (salt in their food)’
   The general non-habitual negator ma: and the habitual negator ak@s are both used as pro-
clauses in elliptical replies—see 14.51 and 14.42.
14.51 ñ@n      yaki k@-kwa-na-ñ@n?                ak@s
      you.fem smoke eat-hab-act.foc-2fem.sgbas.vt neg.hab
      ‘ “Do you usually smoke?” “Never!” ’
  Further similarities and diﬀerences between ma: and ak@s are addressed in §14.6.
  The same negator, ak@s, is used to negate irrealis in main clauses, and in counterfactual
conditional clauses, and to negate the optative mood—this is the topic of the next section.
                 14.3 ne gat i o n o f n o n- i n d i c at i v e m o da l i t i e sAll of the non-indicative modalities discussed in Chapter 13 can be negated, with the exception
of the frustrative. Irrealis and optative, on the one hand, and same-subject purposive and
desiderative, on the other, are negated in the same way (§§14.3.1–2). Diﬀerent-subject purposive
is negated in the same way as any verbal predicate in a non-main clause—see §14.3.2 and §14.5.
The negation of nominalizations as predicate heads is addressed in §14.3.3.","[330, 331, 332, 333, 334, 335, 336]"
"Tables A22.2–5 contain independent personal pronouns in Iatmul, Wosera-Abelam, Boiken

         TextsMost texts recorded and analysed (approximately 190 in all) are rather long. These texts include tradi-
tional tales (genre termed gabu-ma:j), traditional stories about historical events which are passed on from
one generation to another (wa-saki-ma:j and blajaya-ma:j), and various songs (mourning songs gra-kudi,
and laments about foiled marriages namai and sui). I have chosen three shorter texts, each from a diﬀerent
speaker, so as to provide as broad a picture as possible. Texts were recorded, transcribed, glossed, and
provided with an explanation by me. Jacklyn Yuamali Benji Ala assisted me with transcribing Texts 1
and 2, and Jennie Kudapa:kw helped with Text 3.
   Text 1 was told by a highly knowledgeable lady, Gaiawalimæg (in her ﬁfties). It is a funny story based
on a word game: ‘see the moon’ or ‘look at the moon’ is an expression used to refer to menstruating
women. A naive husband decides to go and punish the moon for frivolously looking at his wife. As a
result, he suﬀers and repents. This is a gabu-ma:j, a traditional fairy tale type story.
   Text 2 was told by John S@paywus, the esteemed leader (yibunmi) of Avatip, formerly the member of the
provincial Council (now in his seventies). The story is about the origin of Vali:k clan (one of the clans of
the Gla:gw group: see §1.3), based on the encounter of S@sawi and Kamkudi (Kamkundi). The origin of
the Vali:k is connected with the wars with the Gala (Swakap). I have recorded and transcribed at least ten
diﬀerent versions of this same story (another version was published in Takendu 1977; also see Harrison
1993). The Gala wars were discussed in §1.4.1. This is a typical example of a wa-saki ma:j (say-across
story), a traditional story about a historical event.
   Text 3 was told by James Katalu Angi Balangawi, a highly proﬁcient story teller in his ﬁfties, and is
a gabu-ma:j about an unfortunate and somewhat stupid man Oselo who had tried to exterminate all the
snakes.
   The texts below are given in phonological transcription. They are divided in sentences (and are referred
to accordingly throughout the grammar). Comments on interesting or unusual linguistic phenomena
within these sentences and references to the relevant sections of the grammar are provided after each sen-
tence when necessary. Within each sentence, clauses are in square brackets. Smaller complex constituents
(noun phrases and auxiliary constructions) are in braces. Loans from Tok Pisin and English are in italics.

       ‘OK, another traditional tale then again we two will record’
This was the third story Gaiawalimæg (commonly addressed as Gaia) volunteered to tell that day; this is
why she started it with ya:kya. Note the alternative phonetic realization of gabu-ma:j is gama:j (see A7 at
§2.6). The story is considered suﬃciently ‘long’ to warrant masculine agreement on the agreeing modiﬁer
n@k@- ‘other’ (see §5.1). The verb suku- can mean ‘carve, write down, record’, so the second clause is
ambiguous as to whether we two (Gaia and myself) will record the story, or write it down.

       ‘I am Gaia, I will write/record one (story) again’
The ﬁrst clause is a typical verbless naming clause (see §20.1.3). The reactivated topic demonstrative refers
to the topical object, the story itself.

clause the A (‘that man’) is postposed to the verb as a clariﬁcation (see §19.7). Two ‘medial’ clauses (each
marked with same-subject immediate sequence) are postposed to the main clause; the second medial
clause has a summarizing function. The next clause is a rare example of a dependent clause with a non-
verb-ﬁnal order. The next clause—a medial completive clause—contains the same verb as the preceding
clause. This is a typical example of bridging ‘head-tail’ clause or sentence linkage (as is the third clause
in this sentence: see §20.4.1). Within the second clause, the nominal clause ‘there is another man’ is an
instance of contrastive focus (see §20.3). The last clause is a speech report consisting of the attention
getter ‘hey’.","[653, 654, 655]"
"
                         15.3.2 Minor verb precedes major verbCompounds of the second type are composed of a verb from a closed class (‘minor’ verb)
which provides a valency-changing or an aktionsart speciﬁcation followed by a verb from an
open class. These are summarized in Table 15.2. Such compounds are highly restricted: only
two ‘minor’ verbs, wa- ‘say’ and yi- ‘go, say’, can occur in V1 slot. The existing combinations
with V2 can be exhaustively listed. Their semantics is only partly predictable.
   A valid analytical option would be to analyse these instances of V1 as preﬁxes. None of them
can occur together with the preﬁx kay- ‘causative/manipulative’ (see §16.2.1).
   Two minor verbs can occur as V1 in grammaticalized compounds: (B1) wa- ‘say’, and (B2)
yi- ‘go, say’. Neither of these is productive.
B1. Cause-effect compounds with ‘say’ involve four verbs in V2 slot: yaga- ‘be scared’, j @wi-
‘be awake’, la:kw- ‘know’, and buti- ‘fold’. Unlike in the cause-eﬀect compounds discussed in
370      15 Verb Compounding  Table 15.2 Asymmetrical compounds: minor verb precedes major verb  Form and translation         Meaning in compounds                                  Discussed in  wa- ‘say’                    causative (four or ﬁve verbs)                         B1

§15.2 above, the actual meaning of ‘saying’ is bleached: ‘scaring’ or ‘wakening’ does not have
to be done by speaking.
    The S=A ambitransitive verb yaga- ‘be scared (of something)’ is illustrated in 15.112a where
it is used transitively. It can also be used intransitively, as in yaga-tukwa (be.scared-proh) ‘don’t
be scared!’.

        ‘I was scared to go down (there) on my own’
   In 15.112b, the same verb appears in a compound with wa-, with a causative meaning ‘scare
someone’. The child cried because I was the ﬁrst white person he had ever seen; I did not have
a chance to talk to him—so the causation has nothing to do with a speech act.

  The verb j @wi ‘wake up, be awake’ is strictly intransitive—see 15.113a.

  In 15.113b, it is causativized with wa- ‘say’:

        urine feel-3fem.sg-compl.ds I-lk+acc impv-say-be.awake
        ‘If you want to pee (lit. if it feels like peeing), wake me up’
  We saw in 3.1–2 that the verb laku- ‘know, understand’ is S=A ambitransitive. A compound
consisting of wa- ‘say’ and laku- ‘know, understand’ is a strictly transitive verb meaning ‘give
advice (as a parent to the child)’, as illustrated in 15.114a and 15.114b:
15.114a [an-a       amæy l@-k@                wa-laku-majik     wuk@-ku]

        come-1dusubj.p-3fem.sgbas.p dem.dist.react.top.fem.sg
        ‘Having listened to our mother’s advice, here we came’
   In 15.114b, this same compound occurs with the purposive suﬃx (this is a complementation
strategy).

                                                                   15.3 Asymmetrical compounds                371   This verb is quite speciﬁc in its meaning: it can only be used to refer to advice given from
someone superior to someone inferior—that is, it is not appropriate for an equal member of a
peer group.
   The fourth verb which occurs with a preﬁxed wa- is an S=A ambitransitive verb buti- ‘be
folded; fold’: the strictly transitive verb wa-buti- means ‘fold forcefully or with care; fold a
full length of something, e.g. a long sheet’. It is similar in its meaning to kay-buti- (manip-
fold) ‘fold a full length of a big object’ (see §16.2.1). In this instance, wa- does not really
causativize the verb buti- (neither does it have any implication of a speech act): it restricts
an ambitransitive verb to a transitive use, and adds an implication of full extent of activity and
a special manipulative eﬀort. This is in line with the way kay- ‘causative-manipulative’ is used
with transitive verbs, but quite unlike all other instances of wa- as a putative V1 .
   At least one other form may contain a causative with wa-. The form suan ‘diﬃcult’ occurs
as copula complement of the auxiliary yi ‘say, go’ (see §4.2.2), as in suan yi-na (diﬃcult
go-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt) ‘it is diﬃcult’ (see 4.7). 1 The S=O ambitransitive verb wa-sway-
‘postpone, be postponed, undo the plan’, may be related to it (e.g. wasway-na-d@wun ‘I could
not do it’; wasway-na ‘it was postponed’, a-wasway ‘postpone!’, wasway-bran ‘we postponed’).
   The class of wa- causatives may be bigger, if we include other compounds involving wa-
‘say’. Under A8 above, we analysed wa-t@p(@)- (say-be.closed) ‘forbid, deprive’ (see 15.92–3)
as a subtype of asymmetrical compound with -t@p(@-) as V2 , with a somewhat unpredictable
meaning. This verb can be equally well analysed as having causativizing wa- as V1 and
-t@p(@)- ‘be closed, fence, ?stop’ as V2 . Its somewhat unpredictable meaning ‘forbid, deprive’
can be easily linked with the meaning of the components: ‘make stop, tell to stop’. Similarly,
a lexicalized symmetrical-looking compound wa-t@k- (say-break) ‘accuse’ can be interpreted
as a wa- causative with an idiosyncratic meaning. So can wa-yak@- (say-throw) ‘send, order’
(illustrated in 15.110–11), since its meaning is not a sum of the meanings of its components.
   The causatives with wa- as V1 form a closed class, whose exact membership is debatable.
The semantics of each of the causatives is not quite straightforward. At a ﬁrst glance, there is
nothing wrong with this analysis. It is even corroborated by the fact that wa- ‘say’ is used as a
causative strategy with transitive verbs in biclausal structures (see §16.2.2). In addition, verbs of
speech are easily grammaticalized as causative markers, both in languages of New Guinea (e.g.
Yimas: Foley 1991), and in most other parts of the world (Heine and Kuteva 2002; Aikhenvald
2008). However, a typological analogy is not a proof. We cannot exclude an alternative option:
that wa- ‘causatives’ do not contain the verb ‘say’, but a transitivizing preﬁx wa- with no known
etymology.
B2. The verb yi- ‘go, say’ occurs as V1 in three combinations, all with diﬀerent meanings.
Its causative meaning occurs with one verb: we saw in §4.2.2 that pa:kw- ‘hide’ is intransitive—
see 15.115a and 15.2. Its transitive counterpart is yi-pakw- ‘hide (something)’—see 15.115b and
15.54. This verb is strictly transitive for traditional speakers; innovative speakers can use it as
an S=O ambitransitive (see §4.2.2).15.115a d@-k@-k       pakw@n t@-k-na-d@wun-@k
        he-obl-dat hide+seq stay-fut-act.foc-1masc.sgbas.vt-conf

        ‘Having gone oﬀ, she already hid him, the snake, very well in the faraway house’
   The causativizing eﬀect of yi- ‘go, say’ is reminiscent of the causativizing eﬀect of wa- ‘say’ as
V1 . The same verb yi- occurs as V1 in combination with the extended intransitive verb s@wul-
‘turn into, become’, imparting an overtone of full achievement. The two are illustrated in
15.116:
15.116 bau yi-s@wul-@l              s@w@l-ku,       m@umiya:m            ata

       ‘She fully turned into haze; having turned (into haze), she was standing at the base of
       a tree looking upwards’
   The verb yi- combines with a transitive verb gaji- ‘rub, spread, clean, wipe, squash’, forming
a compound yi-gaji- ‘spread, rub’. The resulting meaning diﬀerence is quite subtle. The verb
gaji- describes cleaning, wiping, rubbing, spreading, or destroying (by crushing or dissolving)
something which one has not put in there. For instance, the correction ﬂuid was described
as gaji-kwa-dana ja:p (rub-hab-3plsubj.vt+3fem.sgbas.vt thing) ‘thing they rub or eliminate
(things) (with)’. In 15.117, this same verb describes ‘rubbing and cleaning one’s eyes’, and in
15.118 it refers to killing a centipede by squashing it.

  A speaker shouted at an annoying child: gaji-k@-tua-ñ@n (squash-fut-1sgsubj.vt-

oﬀ—after we’d completed picking peanuts Mali told me to wipe my dirty hands with a towel:
taw@la:r a-gaj (towel+lk+all impv-clean/rub/wipe) ‘wipe (the dirt oﬀ) with a towel!’
  The compound yi-gaj-, with yi- as V1 , implies spreading a speciﬁc substance (ointment or
water) over the whole surface, as in 15.119 and 15.120.
15.119 [gu   kur-ku]        [ta:b a-yi-gaj]

       ‘Having got water, spread (water) on (your) hand (to ease the itching of mosquito bites)’
   Note that an ointment in 15.120 is referred to as yi-gaj-@-ja:p ‘spreading thing’. This is very
diﬀerent from the term for correction ﬂuid mentioned above (‘thing they rub or eliminate
(things) (with)’).

       ‘He spread the (magic) ointment (for attracting women over his body)’   A similar example is at 15.128. It looks as if yi- in yi-gaj- adds an extra participant to the verb,
that is, both an instrument of rubbing and the surface to be rubbed on. This function may be
linked together through the use of yi- as a causativizing device with the intransitive verb ‘hide’.
However, the number of examples is so limited, and each use of yi- as V1 so idiosyncratic, that
none of these observations is likely to extend beyond speculation.
   One can equally well state that yi- in all the three verbs discussed here is simply a nonce
preﬁx, and has nothing to do with the verb yi- ‘say, go’.                      15.4 com binations of verb comp oundsSymmetrical and asymmetrical verb compounds diﬀer as to how they can be ‘nested’ within
one another. A compound with complex structure typically contains no more than three verb
roots.
   A symmetrical compound can occupy the V1 slot of an asymmetrical compound of all types
listed in Table 15.1, except for -t@p(@)- compounds which are more idionsyncratic than others,
e.g. [ [vya-l@pa]-yak@]- (hit-cut-fully) ‘hit and break fully; cut cross-wise fully’, [ [væs@- p@rki]-
ya]- (step-tear-come) ‘keep stepping and tearing’, [ [vya-l@pa]-taka]- (hit-cut-put) ‘hit and break
in a downward direction involving large surface’. Also see 15.39a–b, and 16.40 (t@p@-taka-ya-
(be.closed-put-come) ‘keep closing (the road) oﬀ’).
   In 15.121, a sequential compound containing an inherently directional verb væki- as its V2
combines with yi- ‘go’. The resulting compound has a motion-direction meaning ‘do while
going’ (see A4 above):15.121 ata [ [kur-væki]-yi]-l                [kur-væki-ku]           [ [k@-b@r     yag@l
       then do-go.across-go-3fem.sgbas.p do-go.across-compl.ss dem.prox-du destitute

       go-3dubas.p/vt child:du sleep then stay-3dubas.p/vt
       ‘She then went on going across and acting like this (collecting wild breadfruit), having
       done (like this) going across the two destitute children went to sleep’   That kur-væki- ‘do (and) go across’ is the main verb in the compound kur-væki-yi- ‘went on
going across and doing’ is corroborated by the fact that just this part is repeated in a completive
clause in a tail-head structure in 15.121.
   Very occasionally, a V1 or a V2 within a cause-eﬀect or a sequential compound can be a
compound. Two compounds—one as V1 and one as V2 —are not attested. In all the attested
cases, the second part of the compound V1 or V2 is a non-existent root, e.g. [vya-t@pu]V1 -
kiyaV2 - (hit-?-die) ‘be killed and die’ and taniV1 -[yi-ba:gw]V2 - (turn-go-?) ‘turn and go round
and round’. One lexicalized compound based on vya- ‘hit, kill’, vya-t@pu- (hit/kill-?) ‘kill’, forms
a cause-eﬀect compound, as in vya-t@pu-kiya-kwa (hit-?-die-impv.3p+fem.sg) ‘Let her be killed
and die’ (said in annoyance about a particularly nosy and naughty child). This example may
have resulted from contraction of a sequential construction with -n in rapid speech.
   The V1 slot of an asymmetrical compound can be a compound containing wa- or -yi- as
their V1 , as in 15.122:

   Asymmetrical compounds containing kus@- ‘ﬁnish’ (A1), ∗ -t@ka/pæsa ‘do incompletely’
(A2), -k@ta ‘try’ (A3), -taka ‘put, arrange by spreading’ (A7), -t@p ‘be closed’ (A8), ∗ -ba:gw-
‘do incessantly’ (A9), and ∗ -pakw- ‘do all, aﬀect all’ (A10) can occur as V1 with one of -yi ‘go’
(A4), -ya ‘come’ (A5), and ∗ -yak@- ‘do fully’ (A12) as V2 . The form ∗ -jika ‘do properly’ (A11)
is not attested in complex compounds. An asymmetrical compound V1 cannot appear in the
‘go-come’ construction (A6).
   Some examples are at 15.123–6 and 15.101 ([ [kus@-pakw@]-yak@]-da-k (ﬁnish-do.all-fully-
3pl-compl.ds) ‘after they completely all died’). In all such cases, the last verb speciﬁes motion-
direction, aspect, or extent of the complex V1 .

  That the verbs -yi ‘go’ (A4), -ya ‘come’ (A5), and ∗ -yak@- ‘do fully’ (A12) as V2 can occur
in compound verbs—whether symmetrical or asymmetrical—as grammatical markers goes
together with their high productivity. That V2 and not V1 marks aspect, motion-direction,
and extent accords with the predominantly suﬃxing character of Manambu.
  The forms -yi- ‘go’ (A4), -ya- ‘come’ (A5), and ∗ -yak@- ‘do fully, fully’ (A12) as V2 are
the most likely candidates for further development into grammatical markers. We can recall
that -ya- as an aspect marker may not even be connected with the verb ya- ‘come’, and
-yak@- ‘do fully’ does not really have a corresponding full verb in the language. Their status
                                                       15.5 Reduplication in compounds         375is thus comparable with that of -kwa-, a marker of habitual aspect which could have come
from grammaticalization of the verb -kwa- ‘stay’, and its past form, -yi-kwa-, which may well
have come from a combination of ‘stay’ and ‘go’. The only reason why the habitual aspect
is considered together with other aspectual categories (§12.3), and -yi- ‘go’ (A4), -ya- ‘come’
(A5), and ∗ -yak@- ‘do fully’ (A12) as V2 are treated on a par with verb compounds, lies in
the grammatical properties of the forms: habitual has its own system of negation (§14.2). The
habitual marker cannot be reduplicated; neither can -yi- ‘go’ and -ya- ‘come’ in compounds. In
contrast, ∗ -yak@- ‘do fully’ can—see the following section.
                        15.5 r e d u p l i c at i o n i n c o m p o u n d sWe saw in §12.8.2 that both components of a compound verb can undergo full reduplication
(see 12.57–8); the meaning is that of intensive and continuous activity, as in v@-s@m@l- (see-?)
‘look for’, v@-s@m@l-s@m@l- ‘look for something very carefully’, and vya-t@m@l- ‘hit-roll’, ‘make
roll or sound by hitting’, vya-t@m@l-t@m@l (hit-roll-red) ‘make roll or sound by hitting many
times’, as in 15.24b. The ﬁrst component of a symmetrical and of an asymmetrical compound
can be reduplicated, as in 12.64 and the ﬁrst line of 15.50, where it indicates continuous action.
The second component of a symmetrical cause-eﬀect compound can be fully reduplicated, to
indicate intensity—as in 15.23.
   Any second component of an asymmetrical compound can be reduplicated, except for
-yi- ‘go’ and -ya- ‘come’, and the components of the ‘go-come’ construction. In 15.127, the
second component ∗ -t@ka- ‘do incompletely’ undergoes reduplication (accompanied by vowel
omission: see §12.8.2): the meaning is ‘bit by bit but not fully’.

       ‘Having killed (her), after she’d died, having cut (her body) bit by bit (incompletely) he
       put her straight into the pot’
  Further similar examples are at 12.65–6 (-yak@- ‘do fully’), and 15.102 (-jika- ‘properly’).
  Both components of an asymmetrical compound can be reduplicated separately as an
expressive device, e.g. vya-vy-taka-taka-l@-d (hit-hit:red-put.down-put.down-3fem.sgsubj.p-
3masc.sgbas.p) ‘she hit him downwards really strongly’; also see 12.68. This does not happen
with symmetrical compounds.
  Compounds with yi- as V1 (see §15.3.2) can occupy the V1 slot of any asymmetrical com-
pound (except for -t@p compounds). The verb yi-gaji- (go-spread) as V1 with -yak@ ‘do fully’
as V2 is illustrated in 15.128. The second component, gaji-, is reduplicated to express the full
extent of ‘wiping’:
15.128 [kamkaw-a-ñan          k@-ta:y     [ [yi-gaji-gaji]V1 -yak@]V2 -ta:y]

376      15 Verb Compounding  We can recall from B in §12.8.2 that -ba:gw- ‘do incessantly’ and -jika- ‘properly’ can undergo
partial reduplication, with an iterative meaning. This kind of reduplication is not found with
any other kinds of V2 of asymmetrical compounds.
                                        15.6 s ummaryVerb compounds in Manambu fall into symmetrical and asymmetrical. The former can express
conventionalized sequences of sub-events, manner, and cause-eﬀect. The latter consist of a
major verb and a minor verb which speciﬁes its aspect, motion-direction, and extent. The
minor verb can also aﬀect the valency of the whole compound. This is the case with -taka
‘put’ as a V2 .
   Manambu verb compounds vary in how semantically unpredictable they are. Most of the
Manambu compounds have to be listed in the lexicon, rather than generated via grammatical
rules. Many of them show superﬁcial similarities with English phrasal verbs, or prepositional
verbs in German, Estonian, or Hungarian, in that the sum of the meanings of components
does not allow us to predict what the compound would mean.
   Some compounds could alternatively be analysed as suﬃxing, or even preﬁxing structures
(see §15.3.2). The V1 in any grammatical compound can consist of a verbal root followed by a
directional, e.g. [yak@-su]V1 -k@taV2 - (throw-up-try) ‘try and throw high up’. This is the topic of
the next chapter.
        16        Directionals and Valency-Changing Devices
Marking directionality of action on the verb is a prominent feature of Manambu. We discuss
verbal directionals in §16.1, and then contrast them with directionals on nominal demonstra-
tives (discussed in §10.2.1). Directionals are among the many valency-manipulating devices in
the language which are discussed in §16.2. Of these, the causative-manipulative derivation is
the only semi-productive exclusively valency-changing morphological device in the language.
At the end of §16.2, we also look at the expression of reﬂexive and reciprocal meanings.                                    16.1 di r e c t i o na ls                          16.1.1 Formal aspects of directionalsManambu verbs fall into four categories depending on which directional markers they take, if
any. We distinguish four classes of verbs, two closed and two open. The forms and the meanings
of the inherently directional verbs, the directional markers with intrinsically directional verbs,
and bound directional forms with optionally directional verbs (I–III below) are given in
Table 16.1. This table also contains directional forms used with demonstratives (see Table
10.5, which includes some verbal directionals). An etymological connection between the roots
of inherently directional verbs, the directional suﬃxes on intrinsically directional verbs, and
bound directionals is apparent. The shared morphemes are in bold. Table 16.2 features the
directional suﬃxes used with intrinsically directional verbs.
I. Inherently directional verbs include the six basic verbs war- ‘go upwards’, da- ‘go
downwards’, væki- ‘go across (away from the speaker)’, væra- ‘go across (towards speaker)’,
wula- ‘enter, come in, come in a direction from the Sepik River’, and waku- ‘go out (including
motion in the direction away from the Sepik River)’. These verbs do not take any further
directional speciﬁcations. Their roots are the base for directionals on other verbs, and on
demonstratives—see Tables 16.1 and 10.5. Inherently directional verbs occur as V2 within
sequencing compounds (§15.2.1) indicating that the action of V1 was accompanied by, or done
at the same time as, movement in a given direction. See §16.1.4.
II. Intrinsically directional verbs include the following four roots which must take direc-
tional suﬃxes each of which corresponds to an inherently directional verb and has a corre-
sponding bound directional form:
IIa. kar-/kra-/∗ ka- ‘bring, carry’ has the allomorphs: kar-, kra-, and ka- in complementary
distribution depending on the morphological context (see ﬁrst column of Table 16.2). The
form ka- is used with the directional ‘up’ (all forms except second person imperative), ‘across
towards speaker’ (all forms except second person imperative), and ‘away from the Sepik River
or inside’ (all forms except second person imperative). The form kar- is used only with the
directional ‘downward’ (all forms except second person imperative) and in a directional form
378      16 Directionals and Valency-Changing Devices‘bring from or take to a faraway place’. The form kra- is used in all other instances (including
all second person imperatives containing a directional).
   The root ∗ ka- never occurs on its own. The root kra- with an allomorph k@r- in a word-ﬁnal
position means ‘marry, take as a wife’. It could be related to the allomorph kra- of the verb
∗
  kar-/kra- ‘bring, take’. The exact nature of the vowel alternation in kar-/kra- remains a puzzle.
   The bound verbal root ka- also occurs with a verb -sapwi ‘disclose something, with an
implication of sudden discovery and outward movement’, in ka-sapwi- (‘move/bring’-disclose)
‘open up to disclose something’. Whether this is the same ka- as the one which occurs in the
intrinsically directional verb kar-/kra-/∗ ka- ‘bring, carry’ is an open question.
IIb. The form -k@ta-, also used as a suppletive combining form of the verb ‘look’ (see §15.2),
takes the directional markers to provide directional speciﬁcations for v@- ‘see/look’. Note that,
since directionals make the verb telic (see §16.1.3), the translation ‘look’, and not ‘see’, is
appropriate for v@- with a directional. The resulting forms are independent grammatical and
phonological words which cannot head a predicate; they can be classiﬁed as adverbs. No free
forms other than ata ‘then’ can intervene between the directional and the verb ‘see/look’ (see
16.56). The form -k@ta+directional typically precedes the verb ‘look’, but can also follow
it. The verb ‘look’ can be ellipsed. The root -k@ta means ‘try’ in asymmetrical compounds
discussed in §15.3.
IIc. The generic verb s@- ‘plant; put; call’ can occur on its own. And it also appears to occur
with several directional suﬃxes, in s@-wul(a)- ‘push inside’, sada- ‘put downwards’, and saku-
‘push outwards’ (also see 16.44, and further discussion in §16.1.3).
IId. The verb t@- ‘stand, stay, be’ can occur on its own in a variety of functions—as posture
verb, as a copula, and as an auxiliary. In its postural meaning it occurs with one directional
suﬃx: tapra- means ‘stand facing speaker’.
III. Optionally directional verbs include all verbs which imply motion, e.g. lagu- ‘pull’,
yak@- ‘throw’, prap@- ‘be upside down’, blak@- ‘turn downwards’, kur- ‘get’, s@- ‘plant, put,
move’, and a number of verbs which do not. Directional distinctions, each of which has a
corresponding inherently directional verb, are expressed with bound forms consisting of s-
followed by a directional marker. Three further distinctions are expressed with directional
suﬃxes -tay ‘sideways away from speaker or reference point’, -tæy ‘sideways towards speaker
or reference point’, or reduplicated -tay-tay- ‘back and forth’. These three cannot occur
on intrinsically directional verbs. Bound directionals often develop somewhat unpredictable
idiomatic connotations, especially with verbs which do not have to imply motion, e.g. kiya-saki-
(die-across.away.from.speaker) ‘half-die’, wa-saki- (speak-across.away.from.speaker) ‘tell a tra-
ditional story’, ta-saku- (hit/move-outward) ‘appoint, elect someone’, ku-su- (put-upwards)
‘wear, put on (clothing)’. See §16.1.2. One verb, or one clause, can contain two directionals—
see §16.1.4.
A full set of bound directional forms and directional suﬃxes with the verb yak@- ‘throw’ is
shown in 16.1. Also see Table 16.1.16.1 yak@-su ‘throw upwards’
     yak@-sada- ‘throw down’
     yak@-saki ‘throw across away from speaker or reference point’
     yak@-sapra- ‘throw across toward speaker or reference point’
     yak@-s@w@l- ‘throw inside or away from the Sepik River’
     yak@-saku- ‘throw in the outward direction’
                                                                       16.1 Directionals       379     yak@-tay- ‘throw sideways away from speaker or reference point’
     yak@-tæy- ‘throw sideways toward the speaker or reference point’
     yak@-tay-tay- ‘throw back and forth’Bound forms which contain more than two syllables require a secondary stress—in this respect,
they are more similar to nominal compounds than to verbal compounds (§2.5). They cannot
be considered clitics: we can recall that all clitics in Manambu can be also used as independent
words. Their phonological similarity to compounds is corroborated by their etymology: we will
see below that bound directionals are likely to be composed of a generic root s@- ‘put, plant’
and the directional suﬃxes occurring on intrinsically directional verbs. Directional suﬃxes do
not require a secondary stress, unless reduplicated—we can recall, from §2.5, that this is a
property of reduplicated morphemes.
  All the directionals can be used with the general verb m@gi- ‘do whatever; be or become
whatever’. Given its highly general meaning, this verb presents an almost perfect testing
ground for establishing the core meanings of the directionals. This verb is S=A and S=O
ambitransitive. We will see, at §16.1.3 below, that the bound directional morphemes increase
valency making the action telic—as a consequence, if m@gi- is accompanied by a directional, it
has to refer to a transitive and telic action (see 16.58d).16.2 m@gi-su- ‘do whatever upwards’
     m@gi-sada- ‘do whatever down’
     m@gi-saki- ‘do whatever across away from speaker or reference point’
     m@gi-sapra- ‘do whatever across toward speaker or reference point’
     m@gi-s@w@l- ‘do whatever inside; tuck inside; move away from the Sepik River’
     m@gi-saku- ‘do whatever in the outward direction, stretch out’
     m@gi-tay- ‘do whatever sideways away from speaker or reference point’
     m@gi-tæy- ‘do whatever sideways toward the speaker or reference point’
     m@gi-tay-tay- ‘do whatever back and forth’Two monosyllabic verbs, ta- ‘move, hit’ and ku- ‘put, move’ do not occur without directionals,
e.g. ku-su- (put/move-up) ‘move up; put upwards; put on (clothes)’, ku-sada- (put/move-down)
‘move or put downwards’, ku-saki- ‘put, move across away from speaker’, ku-s@w@la- ‘put
inside; put on (shoe), put spear in/spear’; ta-saki- ‘move across away from speaker’, ta-sapra-
‘move across towards speaker’; ta-saku- ‘appoint, elect someone’. The verb ku- also occurs with
the verb -sapwi- ‘disclose, with an implication of sudden discovery and outward movement’: ku-
sapwi- (‘put’-disclose) means ‘come out of something, e.g. a nose of an animal sticking out of
a burrow’.
IV. Verbs which do not combine with directionals are copula verbs, positional verbs with
the exception of t@- ‘stand’, the general motion verbs yi- ‘go’ and ya- ‘come’, ingestive verbs k@-
‘consume without chewing (that is, eat, drink, and smoke: §21.1.1)’ and j@- ‘chew’, and stative
verbs, such as warsam(a)- ‘be angry’.
   Inherently directional verbs do not form one class in terms of their transitivity. The verbs
war-, da-, væki-, and væra- are strictly intransitive. The verb w@r-/wur- ‘bring something up (e.g.
from water)’ could be related to war- ‘go up’ (interestingly, the Wosera/Ambulas verb waaré
‘go up; put up, e.g. on neck’—which corresponds to both Manambu war- and w@r- —is S=A
ambitransitive). The verb wula- ‘enter’ is an S=O ambitransitive (see §4.2.2).
   Four directional markers result from a straightforward grammaticalization of inherently
directional verbs:
                                                                                                                                                     380

100      4 Word Classes   Verbs are used to express some dimension concepts, e.g. kau- ‘be deep’ and v@rv@r - ‘be
shallow’; value, such as perfect or strange; physical properties, human propensity, qualiﬁcation,
e.g. r @ p- ‘be enough’, and position. Adverbs are used for speed, while diﬃculty is covered
with nominals. Similarity is expressed with postpositional structures (see §4.5.2 on k@t@k ‘like’).
Quantiﬁcation is marked with quantiﬁers (§10.5). Ordinal and cardinal numbers are a special
class (§10.6.1). An exception is ta:y ‘ﬁrst’ which is an adverb.
                                          4.4 a dv e r b sAdverbs form a semi-open heterogeneous class of over forty members. They do not have any
grammatical categories characteristic of other word classes. Their major syntactic function
is to modify verbs. Unlike manner arguments, adverbs are never cross-referenced on the
verb.
   Many underived adverbs are monosyllabic, e.g. k@ p ‘just’, ma:k ‘personally, in person’, b@
‘already’, ma: ‘again’, ta:y ‘ﬁrst, preceding’, the reﬂexive-emphatic ka:p ‘oneself, by oneself’
(4.63; §16.2.4). Some are disyllabic, e.g. (ma:) n@bay ‘not yet’, walba:b ‘close’, wayway ‘maybe’,
jaujay ‘in a sloppy, incorrect way’, and arguably also the reciprocal marker awarwa (in itself, the
comitative case form of the noun awar ‘side, sideways direction’: see §16.2.4). A few adverbs
come from nouns, e.g. s@k ‘far’, from s@k ‘long distance’; ma:k ‘in person’, from ma:k ‘face,
person’ (as in 4.69), or gañ ‘last’, related to g@ñ ‘tail’ (4.60–2).
4.60 S@sawi ta:y, d@ gañ ata yi-b@r
     Sesawi ﬁrst he last then go-3dubas.p
     ‘Sesawi went ﬁrst, he (Kamkudi) last’
   The alternative form of the same adverb is g@ñ ‘last’ which coincides with the noun ‘tail’,
and could be a back formation from the noun in its use as modiﬁer, where it also means ‘last’,
e.g. g@ñ-a ta:kw (tail-lk woman) ‘last/non-ﬁrst wife’.
   Adverbs may contain derivational suﬃxes which have the same segmental make-up as case
markers. The suﬃx -Vb is similar to the terminative case -Vb and is used to derive adverbs
from some nominals (which are typically used as copula complements), e.g. kwam-a:b (crazy-
lk+term) ‘by mistake, not thinking’, s@k-a:b (far-lk+term) ‘far, from afar, to a far point’,
from noun phrases, e.g. kwasa-m@y-a-b (little+fem.sg-very-lk-term) ‘little by little; a little bit’,
from nouns, e.g. ta:l ‘past’, tal-a:b ‘long time ago’, and from other adverbs, e.g. k@ p ‘still, yet,
just’ (see §21.2.2), k@pa:b ‘in case’, awar ‘one-sidedly’, awar-@-b ‘in turn’.
   This same formative occurs in some adverbs which do not appear to be derived (synchron-
ically), e.g. waya:b ‘in very recent past; just now’; s@ms@ma:b ‘no way’. This formative also
occurs in nakamib ‘together’, from nak, nakam@y ‘one’. The meaning of this suﬃx is hardly
predictable; similarly to the terminative case, it is stressed.
   The suﬃx -Vr is similar to the allative-instrumental case -Vr. Unlike the case suﬃx, it is not
stressed. It is used to derive adverbs from nouns, e.g. g´@ñ@r ‘later’ (cf. g@ñ ‘tail’; g@ñ´@r ‘to tail;
with tail’), from some non-agreeing adjectives, e.g. s@mir ‘along’ (from s@mi ‘long’) and páp@r
‘a little later’ (from pa:p ‘short’) and from underived adverbs, e.g. ta:y ‘before, in front, ahead’,
tá:yir ‘previously; towards the front’; m@y ‘very’, m´@yir ‘really’.
   This same formative appears in a few other adverbs, such as japwár ‘conveniently’, yapwur
‘quickly’. Note that the allative-instrumental case forms are reminiscent of adverbs in their
semantics and usage, especially if repeated, as in ab-á-r ab-á-r (head-lk-all head-lk-all)
                                                                          4.4 Adverbs       101‘head ﬁrst’. The adverb kuk´@r ‘after, later’ is also used as a postposition (see §4.5.2). A
few inherently repeated adverbs are derived from verb roots, e.g. pakwúr pakwúr (hide+all
hide+all) ‘in a secretive way’ (from pa:kw- ‘be hidden’).
   A formative -Vk, similar to the dative case marker -Vk, appears in mad@k mad@k ‘especially,
namely’. The comitative -wa appears to derive adverbs with the meaning of ‘all the referents’
from a few nouns, e.g. mi: ‘tree; high’, miy-awa ‘together; whole’, t@ p ‘village’, t@p-awa ‘the
whole village’ (see §7.9). A few derivational formatives occur on numbers (see §10.6.1) deriving
adverbs, e.g. -k@r@b ‘together’, as in v@ti-k@r@b ‘two together’. The formative -ta:y in b@ta:y
‘already’ may be cognate to the verbal cotemporaneous sequencing suﬃx -ta:y (§18.4). This
adverb is unusual in that it can occur with the verbal conﬁrmation marker -@k, beta:y@k ‘right
now, already’ (see §12.5). A few adverbs typically occur repeated, e.g. yapwur yapwur ‘quickly’,
or reduplicated, e.g. s@ms@ma:b ‘no way’, wayway, w@yw@yau ‘maybe’, and r @ka:r@k ‘properly’.
The adverbial derivational suﬃxes (none of which is productive, or semantically predictable)
are the only adverb-speciﬁc morphological property.
   A few frequently used forms containing the suﬃx -@n ‘manner sequencing’ are on the
way towards becoming grammaticalized as adverbial manner modiﬁers (see §19.9). Exam-
ples include yi:n (go+seq) ‘all along’, as in ñikiñiki yi:n k@l@b say-na-di (red go+seq
dem.prox+fem.sg+term ﬁnish-act.foc-3plbas.vt) ‘red (colour) all along (the sheet) ﬁnishes
here’, kray-in (bring-seq) ‘up until’, and s@b@n-@n (return-seq) ‘back’, as in s@b@n-@n a-kray
(return-seq impv-take) ‘take (it) back!’ However, they have hardly any of the morphological
properties of the adverbs outlined in Table 4.4. They cannot be considered bona ﬁde members
of the class of adverbs despite their meanings and can be treated on a par with verbal forms,
with one proviso: they cannot be negated independently.
   All three agreeing adjectives can be used adverbially (that is, to modify a verb, or an
adjective)—see 4.53 above. The agreeing value adjective yara ‘ﬁne’ forms part of a derived
adverb yara-kara (which contains a formative not found anywhere else in the language).
   Just like verbs, nouns, and adjectives, all adverbs can be heads of intransitive predicates.
Most adverbs can be modiﬁers in noun phrases. They do not require a linker, e.g. bas wari
(ﬁrst ﬁght) ‘ﬁghting for the ﬁrst time’, ta:yir ñaj (early+adv father’s.brother) ‘the father’s
brother (who was here) earlier’, ta:y ta:kw (early/precedingly woman) ‘ﬁrst wife’ (also see
4.77, ‘previous hole’), miya-wa du (tree+lk-com man) ‘all the men; all men together’ (also
see 15.100).
   Table 4.4 features a comparison of morphological properties and syntactic functions of
adverbs with the three other major word classes—nouns, verbs, and adjectives (see Table 4.2).
1. Negation. If an adverb is the head of an intransitive predicate, it is negated just like a
noun or an adjective in the same function: the negator ma: is placed after the predicate head
(which has no person markers); and no tense distinctions are made, e.g. s@k ma: (far neg) ‘it
is not far’—as a general statement which can refer to present, past, or future. If tense has to
be expressed, then a verbal negative construction with the copula (most often t@-) is used. See
§§14.1.1–2.
2. Compounding is typically not found with adverbs—a property they share with agreeing
adjectives. Just occasionally does an adverb form a compound, e.g. ab-a-gañ (head-lk-last)
‘very last’.
3. Reduplication of adverbs has an ‘intensive’ meaning, e.g. ka:p ‘alone, by oneself’ (also used
as a reﬂexive marker: §16.2.4), kap@-ka:p ‘really alone’, and also as in 4.61:

     d@ tay-tay
     he ﬁrst-ﬁrst
     ‘Thus stepping she went, right after (behind) him, she the very last, he the very ﬁrst’
4. Semantics of -p@k ‘like’ when it occurs with adverbs is similar to that with nouns and verbs,
e.g. miy-a-wa-p@k (tree-lk-com-like) ‘as if all, like it were all’, yabib-a-p@k (quickly-lk-like)
‘as if it were quick’. This suﬃx is not used with most monosyllabic and disyllabic adverbs.
5. The infix -ka- ‘intensive’ is used with just two adverbs: ka:p ‘on one’s own’, kap@-ka-ka:p
‘absolutely on one’s own’, and k@ p ‘just; for nothing’, k@ p-@-ka-k@ p ‘well and truly for nothing’.
6–7. An adverb can modify a verb, as shown in 4.63; this is a function adverbs share with
adjectives. An adverb can modify a nominal copula complement, but not an adjective.
8. An adverb can be a copula complement, e.g. k@p kwa-na-d (just stay-act.foc-
3masc.sgbas.vt) ‘he just stays, stays for nothing’. Some such constructions have idiomatic
meanings, e.g. ma:k kwa- (in.person stay) ‘be born’.
9–10. Just like a verb, an adverb cannot be head of an NP or an argument. An adverb can
be modiﬁed by m@yir—just like a verb, e.g. m@yir yapwur yapwur ma:j bla-kwa-na (real+adv
                                                                       4.5 Closed classes       103quickly quickly talk speak-hab-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt) ‘she speaks really fast’. This is the
only instance of an adverb modifying another adverb. One adverb, gañ ‘last’, can be modiﬁed
by m@y- ‘real, very’, just like a noun or an adjective, as in 4.62:
4.62 ada                            gañ kwa:d                 m@y-a-gañ
     dem.dist.react.top+masc.sg last stay+3masc.sgbas.p real-lk-last
     ‘Then he stayed there last, really last (the very last)’
  As shown in Table 4.4, adverbs share some properties with nouns and adjectives, and some
with verbs. Adverbs can be positioned anywhere in a clause (unless they modify a noun, in
which case they precede that noun). A clause can contain up to three adverbs in the corpus
collected, as shown in 4.63 (adverbs are in bold):
4.63 a-di         t@p      ka:p aba:b b@          kiya-di
     dem.dist-pl village alone all        already die-3plbas.p
     ‘Those (of) the village already all died by themselves’
  This is a unique syntactic property of adverbs: a clause or an NP cannot contain more than
two modiﬁers of other sorts. Some connectives are connected with demonstratives (see §4.5.3).
                                    4.5 c lo s e d c la s s e sClosed classes in Manambu include (a) personal pronouns (Table 3.3 and §10.1); (b) demon-
stratives (§10.2); (c) indeﬁnites (§10.3); (d) interrogatives (§10.4); (d) quantiﬁers, e.g, sama:sam
‘many, much’ (§10.5); and (e) numerals (§10.6). All of these, with the exception of demonstrative
and interrogative adverbs, are similar to nominals in most properties. They diﬀer in the
amount of nominal morphology they take; in their position within a noun phrase; and in their
syntactic functions (whether they can be heads of intransitive predicates, copula complements,
or modiﬁers). Demonstrative and interrogative adverbs do not take nominal cross-referencing
sets when they head a predicate.
   Further closed classes are modal verbs, postpositions, emphatic particle, connectives, horta-
tive, interjections, and onomatopoeia.","[126, 127, 128, 129, 130]"

    ‘It is those wives of yours that are going by’ (as a joke, to a man, indicating a group of
    marriageable relatives)
If the noun ta:kw appears on another kinship term as an overt feminine ‘gender marker’ (see
§5.3), it can also be pluralized, as in tid@-takwa:gw (co.wife+lk-woman+lk+pl) ‘women-co-
wives’. Such an expression, seemingly redundant, is used to refer to totemic co-wives who are
not obviously women—for instance, to stars, or female turtles.
   The noun kudi has two meanings: ‘speech, language, noise’ and ‘(the outside of) mouth’. The
second meaning is very restricted: it appears in compounds, e.g. s@p-a-kudi (skin-lk-mouth)
‘lip’, kudi-gu (mouth-water) ‘saliva’, and in ﬁxed expressions, e.g. kudi nak (mouth one) ‘one
mouthful; a little bit’. A general term for mouth is day. The plural kudi-ugw only occurs in the
ﬁrst sense, with a collective meaning (‘lips and mouth’), and has an archaic feel to it. In 6.2,
the speaker chose to accompany it with day, stressing the fact that the character washed the
whole mouth:
6.2 kudi-ugw day       jan-ku
    mouth-pl mouth wash-compl.ss
    ‘After she has washed the whole of her mouth’
   A similar principle applies to the noun gwal-ugw. The noun gwa:l has two meanings:
‘grandchild’ and ‘paternal grandfather’. The plural gwal-ugw is used for both; it also has the
meaning ‘clan’. Only in the ﬁrst two meanings does gwal-ugw always trigger plural agreement.
The ‘double plural’ formation gwal-ugw-@-b@r (grandfather-pl-lk-pl) has only been attested in
the meaning of ‘many paternal grandfathers’ (see B below). The noun gwalugw ‘clan’, though
etymologically a plural form, can have a singular referent, as in 6.3. The clan in question is
considered small—and is accorded feminine gender, realized in agreement on demonstratives
and on possessives:
6.3 aw a                     wulwi ñawi kwasa           gwalugw
    then dem.dist+fem.sg Wulwi Ñawi small+fem.sg clan

    clan     dem.dist.react.top+fem.sg-pred dem.dist.react.top+fem.sg
    ‘Then here is a small clan belonging to Wulwi Ñawi (clan group), this is my clan’
  A dual reference for gwalugw in the meaning of ‘clan’ is illustrated in 6.4, while 6.5 illustrates
plural agreement.

 In summary, plural formation provides an additional mechanism for diﬀerentiating various
meanings of polysemous nouns. We will now discuss further morphological features of number
marking.
B. Dual marking. All the dual forms of kinship nouns (except for ‘child’: see E below) contain
the numeral viti, v@ti ‘two’. Unlike noun phrases consisting of a noun and a numeral, they
  (a) form one phonological word and one grammatical word, since no other constituent can
      intervene between the two, and
  (b) do not allow alternative ordering of components. For instance, in 6.4 the number ‘two’
      can appear before and after the head noun (see §10.6.1 for the discussion). Such alter-
      native ordering is impossible for a dual form of a kin term. Kin terms marked for dual
      require dual agreement on any agreeing constituent, for example:6.6 b@r    awuk,         k@-b@r        n@k@-b@r amæy-v@ti
    you.du impv+hear dem.prox-du other-du mother-two/du
    ‘You two listen, these other two mothers!’
  In contrast to the irregular dual form of the noun ‘child’, the dual forms of kinship
nouns do not combine with the number two: ñ@di viti (child+du two) ‘two children’ is
perfectly acceptable, while ∗ amæy-v@ti viti (mother-two/du two) is not. A noun phrase
amæy viti-viti (mother two-two), with a diﬀerent phonological and grammatical structure,
would mean ‘each two mothers’ and is an example of a distributive noun phrase with a
numeral.
C. Alternative plural forms, with the marker -b@r, and also with -Vgw, have been attested for
most nouns (see Table 6.1). Two nouns, mam-ugw-b@r (elder.sibling-pl-pl) and gwal-ugw-b@r
(grandfather-pl-pl), have double plural markers. In each case, the ﬁrst form in the third column
of Table 6.1 is the most frequent one, and also the one judged correct by many speakers. What
are the factors that may condition the choice of -b@r or of -Vgw as a plural marker, and the
appearance of the seemingly aberrant ‘double plural’?
134     6 Number   Both markers have cognates in other Ndu languages. The plural marker -b@r marks plural
with kin terms in Abelam -béré ‘pluralizer’ (Wilson 1980: 36), and the irregular plural marker
-mbri in Western Wosera (Wendel 1993: 57–8). The plural marker -Vgw has its cognates in
Western Wosera -(n)gu, Abelam -gu (Wilson 1980: 46), where it is also restricted to kinship
nouns. In Manambu, the marker -Vgw is somewhat more productive than the marker -b@r.
(Also see §22.1.)
   For most kin terms listed in Table 6.1, the additional, ‘second-named’, plural is -Vgw. Most
terms have the -Vgw form as their only form. The only noun for which the alternant with -Vgw
does not exist is the noun duama:gw ‘(female ego’s) brother’. This gap may have to do with a
tendency to avoid the occurrence of two labialized consonants in adjacent syllables within one
word (see A6 in §2.6).
   For nouns with the plural -Vgw as the ‘second-named’ plural form, the instances of the
-Vgw plural occur if a preceding noun, within the same noun phrase, or a paragraph, exhibits
the same number marking. In 6.7, the speaker tells a story about the origin of the Manambu
people. He ﬁrst uses a traditional form asay-b@r ‘fathers’:
6.7 ñan-a-di asay-b@r kwa-ku,             a    ñan k@ka
    we-lk-pl father-pl stay-compl.ss then we dem.prox.react.top+fem.sg
    kwa-bana
    stay-1plsubj.vt+3fem.sgbas.vt
    ‘After our fathers had stayed (here), we are living here’
  He then goes on to list thirteen generations of his Manambu ancestors, gwalugw, literally,
paternal grandfathers, and concludes:

    (belong) to the younger siblings’ ﬁreplace here, they are later ﬁreplaces, these (members of
    the clan of) Yimal’
  The use of the -Vgw form on ‘father’ in 6.8 is likely to have been inﬂuenced by the previously
occurring term gwal-ugw, in a very similar meaning, as a kind of ‘echo eﬀect’. Notably, within
the same story the speaker is also talking about sibling relationships—and the plural forms of
the two words for ‘sibling’ involve -Vgw.
  The echo eﬀect has also been noticed in spontaneous conversation: once the speaker chooses
to use an innovative form with the -Vgw plural, they are likely to carry on applying the same
marker to other kin terms within the same noun phrase, or clause. For instance, Tanina asked
me about my asay-ugw (father-pl) ‘fathers, relatives of father’s generation’, and then lamented
the fact that I have no living asay-ugw nor mamay-ugw (maternal.aunt-pl) ‘maternal relatives’.
For both terms, a more traditional option is the -b@r plural.
  The traditional ‘ﬁrst-named’ plural for gwa:l ‘grandchild; father’s father’ is gwalugw—this is
shown in 6.9–10, both from historical accounts of the Manambu wars and migrations. In 6.9
gwalugw is used as a synonym for warag ‘ancestor’ in the collective sense, and asay-b@r ‘fathers’.
                                                                     6.1 Number marking on nouns               1356.9 warag    gwal-ugw         asay-b@r adiya                       ra:n   v@-ku
    ancestor grandfather-pl father-pl dem.dist.react.top+pl sit+seq see-compl.ss
    ‘Having seen ancestors, that is, grandfathers, fathers being (there)’In 6.10, gwal-ugw ‘paternal grandfathers’ and warag-agw ‘ancestors’ (both marked with -Vgw
plural) follow each other: the second one is a speciﬁcation for the ﬁrst one. 26.10 t@p     yi-n    g@r-ku,              ñan-a-di gwal-ugw         warag-agw ya-n

     kar-da-l
     bring-3plsubj.p-3fem.sgbas.p
     ‘Having established the village, our grandparents, ancestors kept bringing (people) here’   If the noun ‘ancestors’ had been used on its own, the preferred form would have been
warag@-b@r.
   However, as we saw above (6.3–5), the term gwalugw also means ‘clan’. A sentence a-di-
awur gwal-ugw-adi (dem.dist-pl-up grandfather-pl-3plnom) is potentially ambiguous—it can
mean either ‘These are the clans that are up there’, or ‘These are your grandfathers (paternal
ancestors) up there’. This sentence was a comment on stars who are supposed to be my
ancestors (since I was adopted into the clan group associated with sun, moon, and stars). That
is, the ambiguity was resolved by context.
   However, to avoid potential misunderstandings, and to diﬀerentiate the meaning ‘clan’ from
the meaning ‘numerous paternal grandfathers’, some speakers opt for an additional plural
marker, -b@r, on gwalugw, in the meaning of ‘many paternal grandfathers’, as in 6.11:6.11 tayir ñan-a-di warag-agw gwalu-gw@-b@r
     before we-lk-pl ancestor-pl grandfather-pl-pl
     ‘Before (having stayed in the village called Asiti, they then stayed in Avatip) our ancestors,
     paternal grandfathers’That is, the double plural marking is a result of a tendency towards disambiguating two
meanings of gwal-ugw—that of a plural, and that of a singular noun ‘clan’. The double
plural form mam-ugw-b@r, used by innovative speakers, has a similar motivation: mam-ugw
(elder.sibling-pl) tends to acquire a collective meaning, of ‘elder siblings as a group’. To ensure
the individuated plural reading of mam-ugw, the additional plural marker -b@r is added. 3
D. Plural marking on non-kinship terms involves the marker -Vgw in three cases (‘mouths’,
‘youngsters’, and the address term k@p). We saw, in C above, that the marker -Vgw is more
frequent and productive than its synonym -b@r with kinship nouns. That it is an archaic
retention, and not an innovation, is corroborated by the fact that the noun kudi in its plural
form kudiy-ugw means ‘mouths’, while in the singular it is much more often used to mean
‘language, noise’, and the meaning ‘mouth’ survives in a handful of compounds and ﬁxed
expressions. That more nouns could take the overt plural -Vgw in the previous stages of the
language is supported by the existence of a few other nouns which, in all probability, go back
to plural forms: the name Gla:gw ‘clan group associated with darkness’ is transparently related  2    The authors of the history accounts often used the Tok Pisin word tumbuna in lieu of both gwal-ugw and warag-
agw.
  3    The form ñamus@-b@r was attested as an ‘echo eﬀect’ of mam-ugw-b@r, within the same clause.
136       6 Numberto g@l ‘black, blackness, dark cloud’. The term kwayugw ‘wet season’ could also be a frozen
plural form.
E. Irregular number marking on ‘child’. The word for ‘child’ has an irregular dual form,
ñ@di, and a plural form ñan-ugw. This word has two meanings, that of a kinship term, ‘child
(of someone)’, and that of an age group, ‘child, young person; non-initiated man’. Dual and
plural forms are usually employed in both meanings. Dual agreement is illustrated in 6.12, and
plural agreement in 6.13.
6.12 aw wun k@-b@r              kwasa-b@r ñ@di-@-k           wa-ku
     then I       dem.prox-du small-du child:du-lk-dat say-compl.ss
     ‘After I told (them) about these two small children (of mine) . . . ’
6.13 wun-a-di ñan-ugw d@y-a-d@             asa:y-a:b ata stakra-tu@-d
     I-lk-3pl child-pl they-lk-masc.sg father-too then meet-1sgsubj.p-3masc.sgbas.p
     ‘Then I met the father of my children, too’
   The dual form often occurs followed by a seemingly redundant number ‘two’, viti, as
in takwa-ñ@di viti (woman+lk-child:du two) ‘two girls’. The term for ‘twins’, kisa-ñ@di
(?-child:du), also typically occurs with the number ‘two’: kisa-ñ@di viti ‘two twins’. This term
only exists in a dual form, and refers to twins only. The form viti here has not yet been
grammaticalized into a dual marker: ﬁrst, it does not form one phonological word with kisa-
ñ@di, and secondly, it can be preposed to kisa-ñ@di (the constituent order in numeral phrases
and its motivation are discussed in §10.6.1 and §20.1.1). 4 If the singular form ñan ‘child,
young people’ has a collective referent, it can trigger plural agreement. We return to this in
the following section.
                                      6.2 number agreementNumber is marked on prehead modiﬁers (which include adjectives, demonstratives, and indef-
inite pronouns), possessives (see §8.1.1), and on predicates. See §5.1.1, and Table 5.1.
   Number agreement is the only means of disambiguating the number of a countable referent.
In 6.14, the number agreement shows that we are talking about two roads—one for men, one
for women:
6.14 k@-b@r        wa-tua-b@r            ya:b k@p kwa-na-b@r
     dem.prox-du say-1sgsubj-3dubas.p road still stay-act.foc-3dubas.vt
     ‘The two roads I am talking about are still there’
Number agreement—just like gender agreement in 5.3–4—helps determine boundaries of
constituents. In 6.15 number agreement shows that ‘I’ is the possessor of ‘village’, and not
of ‘children’. If ‘I’ were the possessor of ‘children’, 6.16 would have been appropriate.
6.15 [wun-a t@p-a]         ñan-ugw-adi      n@ma-di-adi
     I-lk      village-lk child-pl-3plnom big-pl-3plnom
     ‘It is the children of my village who are big’
6.16 [wun-a-di [t@p-a        ñan-ugw-adi] ] n@ma-di-adi
     I-lk-pl village-lk child-pl-3plnom big-pl-3plnom
     ‘It is my village-children who are big’
  4 The English loan twins triggers dual agreement, as in twins-ab@r (twins-3dunom) ‘the (two) were twins’, but does
not occur with v@ti ‘two’.
                                                                  6.2 Number agreement          137  Just like gender, number agreement helps track referents in discourse. And it can also
diﬀerentiate meanings of nouns with uncountable referents—see below.","[157, 158, 159, 160, 161, 162, 163, 164]"

                  2.4.2 Syllable weight and evidence for iambic stress in verbsTwo syllable ‘weights’ can be distinguished. A light syllable has a CV structure and can be
said to contain one mora. A heavy syllable contains two morae and has a CVC, or a CCV ∼
CVC structure. Six verbal suﬃxes have diﬀerent form depending on whether they attach to a
monomoraic verb root or to a heavy multimoraic root: this can be monosyllabic, or contain
more than two syllables. Since hardly any verb root has an inherent long vowel, the issue of the
correlation between morae and long vowels remains open. See Table 2.4.
   All syllable-weight-sensitive suﬃxes (except for future) are stressed on the last syllable and
produce forms which consist of two syllables or more. (Words of four syllables or more require
a secondary stress: see §2.3.1.)
   Suﬃxes 1–3 attach directly to a verb root (which cannot take person markers). The resulting
forms are not inﬂected for person (§3.1; §11.1.1). In the examples below, the syllable-weight-
sensitive suﬃxes are underlined. Suﬃxes 1–2 undergo CV or CVCV reduplication if combined
with a light verb root. Examples with light roots are wa-tà-taká (speak-red-imm.seq) ‘spoke
and’, k@-tà-taká ‘ate and’, kwa-tà-taká ‘stayed and’; wa-yak´@-yak´@p (come-red-fr) ‘speak in
vain’, kwa-yak`@ -yak´@ p ‘stay in vain’. (That a root consisting"" of a labialized stop and a vowel
counts as light constitutes an additional piece of evidence in favour of monophonemic status
of labialized stops: see §2.1.1.) Examples with heavy monosyllabic verb roots of CVC structure
are wàr-taká ‘went up and’, g`@r -taká ‘scratched and’, wàr-yak´@p ‘go up in vain’; of two syllables
and polysyllabic compounds are wulà-taká ‘came in and’, ka-sapwì-taká ‘opened and’; kwak`@ -
yak´@p (look.for-fr) ‘look for in vain’, kayk@t`@ -yak´@p ‘hold on to something in vain’. Roots  13 Suﬃxes typically consist of either a single consonant, or a CV, VC, or a CVC syllable. Disyllabic suﬃxes are very
few (see Table 2.4, for some examples).
50       2 Phonologywith CCV∼CVC structure count as heavy, e.g. blà-taká ‘spoke and’, grà-taká ‘cried and’, vyà-
taká ‘hit and’, grà-yak´@p ‘cry in vain’. That is, Manambu displays the phenomenon of ‘onset
moraicity’.
   The same-subject purposive suﬃx (3 in Table 2.4) requires full reduplication of a light verb’s
root, e.g. k@-ká:k ‘so that (same subject) should eat’, kwa-kwá:k ‘so that (SS) should stay’, s@-
sá:k ‘so that (SS) should plant’. 14 With a heavy root, the form is -@k, as in kayk@t-´@k ‘so that
(SS) should hold on to’, war-´@k ‘so that (SS) should go up’. (With CCV∼CVC roots, the form
is -a:k, as in blá:k ‘so that (SS) should speak’.)
   Suﬃxes 4–5 attach to verb root followed by person markers, and undergo CV reduplication
if the verb root is light, e.g. v@-tù-k@k´@k (see-1sg-purp.ds) ‘for me to see, so that I see’, v@-
tù-k@k´@b (see-1sg-as.soon.as) ‘as soon as I saw’. The resulting forms are partially inﬂected for
person (§3.1; §11.1.1). Unreduplicated allomorphs are used with heavy roots, e.g. wàr-tu-k´@k
‘for me to go up’, wàr-tu-k´@b ‘as soon as I went up’, wakù-tu-k´@k ‘for me to go out’, wakù-tu-
k´@b ‘as soon as I went out’, blà-tu-k´@k ‘for me to speak’; blà-tu-k´@b (speak-1sg-as.soon.as)
‘as soon as I spoke’. If a verb stem consists of a sequence of CV-CV roots it is treated
as heavy (each of the roots on their own would be light), e.g. wa-yà-tu-k´@k (say-come-1sg-
purp.ds) ‘so that I carry on saying’. The future marker (6 in Table 2.4) attaches to the verb root
and is followed by person markers (§12.2); the resulting forms are fully inﬂected for person.
Examples with light root involve full reduplication of the suﬃx, e.g. wa-k´@-k@-tuà (say-fut-
fut-1sgsubj.vt+3fem.sgbas.vt) ‘I will say it’. The unreduplicated form -k@- occurs with heavy
roots, as in wàr-k@-tuá ‘I will go up’, blà-k@-tuá ‘I will speak it’, kayk@t`@ -k@-tuá ‘I will hold
onto it’.
   Each of the verb forms containing suﬃxes discussed here has an iambic stress pattern. They
can be seen as consisting of two feet each with an unstressed (light) syllable followed by a
stressed (heavy) one. The additional syllable created by reduplicating the initial CV of a CVCV
or CVC suﬃx or the initial CVCV of a CVCVC suﬃx serves to satisfy the requirement that
a multisyllable verbal word containing a monomorphemic suﬃx of heavy syllable structure
be divided into two feet of equal length (this agrees with the average length of a preferred
phonological word in Manambu: see §2.5.1). The iambic stress principle is restricted to verbs,
and thus provides an additional point of phonological diﬀerentiation between verbal and non-
verbal roots. 15
                                       2.5 phonolo gical word                                           2.5.1 General propertiesThe main criterion for a phonological word is stress (Dixon and Aikhenvald 2002). Most
frequent types include CV(:)C and CV(:)CV(:). A phonological word cannot contain more
than one long vowel. A word of a CV structure tends to contain a long vowel, e.g. yi: ‘ﬁre’, wu:
‘ton fruit’, ma: ‘again; negative’. (There are a few exceptions, e.g. s@ ‘name; who?’). Otherwise, it
tends to cliticize to another word, as does l@ ‘she’ (see §2.5.3). Or the vowel may be optionally   14 In contrast, the dative-aversive case marker -Vk, formally reminiscent of the same-subject purposive (see §7.11),
can attach to a monosyllabic noun without reduplication, e.g. s@ ‘name’, sa:k ‘for/for fear of name’.
   15 The iambic principle does not apply if a suﬃx is of structure -CV(:)y (e.g. -ta:y ‘cotemporaneous sequencing’:
§18.4; -ga:y ‘unlikely condition’: §18.8), or -CVr (e.g. -k@r ‘desiderative’: §13.5). That it does not operate with the suﬃx
-l@k ‘because’ (§18.7) may be due to the fact that this suﬃx is a product of a recent grammaticalization of a free form
al@k ‘this is why, because’.
                                                                 2.5 Phonological word       51lengthened, e.g. mi, mi: ‘tree, up’, mu, mu: ‘crocodile’. A major class of exceptions with no
optional vowel lengthening is interjections, e.g. tsa, sa! ‘attention getter’ (see §2.1.3).
   Additional phonotactic restrictions determine the boundaries of a word:
    (i) The labiodental fricative v pronounced as such appears only word-initially (then it does
        not have [B] as a possible allophone: see §2.1.1).
   (ii) Only low vowels (with the exception of the long æ:) occur in the word-initial position.
  (iii) No phonological word consists of C@C@.
  (iv) In a monosyllabic monomorphemic phonological word, if C1 and C2 have the same
        place of articulation, the coda (C2 ) cannot be more voiced than the onset (C1 ).
        That is, words like ∗ pab and ∗ tad are not well formed. (This does not apply to
        ta:d ‘he stands/stood’ which consists of two morphemes, the root t@- and the suﬃx
        -d ‘3masc.sgbas.vt/p’).
   (v) A phonological word of more than one syllable cannot contain a sequence of CV-VC
        (see §2.2.1). How this is avoided can be seen in the treatment of loans from Tok Pisin.
        An imperative of the verb raus@-, a loan from Tok Pisin rausim ‘throw out, get out’,
        should be ∗ a-raus. To avoid such an unacceptable structure, this form is pronounced as
        a-rawús, or a-raw´@s, with the word-ﬁnal syllable becoming a glide-V sequence. Along
        similar lines, a native Manambu verb, yak@-saula- ‘throw-inside something or inland’,
        yields the imperative form a-yak@-saw´@l, and not ∗ a-yak@-saúl.
   Further tokens of phonological word boundaries include unreleased stops (see §2.1.1),
prenasalization (D in §2.1.1), and allophonic variation in the pronunciation of @ (C in §2.1.2).
   A preferred phonological word in Manambu does not exceed three syllables in length.
We can recall that most words over four syllables require a secondary stress (see §2.3.1). Its
intensity varies from speaker to speaker; however, the fact that some people tend to write
words like kwatiyà-k@-na-d@m´@n (give.to.nonthird.p-fut-act.foc-2masc.sgbas.vt) ‘You (man)
will give (something to me)’ as kwatiya k@nad@m@n or as kwatiya k@na d@m@n reﬂects the native
speakers’ attempt to ‘conform’ to the length limitations of a preferred phonological word. A
few four-syllable-long phonological words may not require a secondary stress, e.g. yará-kara
(ﬁne-affix) ‘well’.
   Phonological and grammatical word coincide in most cases. As expected (Dixon and
Aikhenvald 2002), reduplication and compounding constitute the instances of mismatches
whereby one grammatical word may consist of more than one phonological word—see §2.5.2.
Two or three grammatical words form one phonological word in the case of some noun phrases,
and if a word contains a cliticizable morpheme—see §2.5.3.","[76, 77, 78]"

                        16.2.4 Reciprocal-associative, and reﬂexivesNeither reciprocals nor reﬂexives are expressed with a valency-changing verbal derivation. The
reciprocal and associative marker awar-wa is the comitative of the inherently locational noun
awar ‘side; sideways direction’ (see §4.4). Both reciprocal and associative uses are consistent
with the meaning of the comitative. We saw in §7.9 that the comitative marks a participant
                                                          16.2 Valency-changing devices      419in an inherently reciprocal action, such as ‘mixing, putting together’ in T3.20 and ‘ﬁghting’
in 7.71. A comitative can mark a participant involved in a reciprocal activity, with the overt
awarwa as in 16.93a, or without it, as in 7.78.
16.93a ñan gur-a-wa         awarwa v@          ma:
       we you.pl-lk-com rec            see.neg fut
       ‘We won’t see each other’ (lit. we with you plural will not see each other)
   An alternative may involve double comitative on both participants, to stress that the action
is mutual, as in 16.93b and 7.79. Both 16.93a and 16.93b are statements made by the spirit
apawul about how they are to become invisible to humans.
16.93b ñan gur-a-wa         ñan-a-wa awarwa v@      ma:
       we you.pl-lk-com we-lk-com rec       see.neg fut
       ‘We won’t see each other at all’
   In 7.79, the two comitatives are also conjoined with the noun phrase linker wa. In terms of
its behaviour and position in a clause, awarwa is identical to any adverb or oblique constituent.
Its position is preferably before the inﬂected verb, but can vary, depending on its pragmatic
status (see §20.2). The reciprocal awarwa is never used with singular A/S.
   When used in a clause containing a transitive or ditransitive verb, a reciprocal may indicate
that A is identical to O and the action is symmetrical, as in 16.93a–b, and 16.94. Once
mentioned in one clause, the reciprocal can be omitted in subsequent clauses:
16.94 [awarwa warapwi-taka-ta:y]      [na:gw warapwi-ta:y]  [yapi-ta:y] [ata
      rec        exchange-put-cotemp sago exchange-cotemp buy-cotemp then
      da-di]
      go.down-3plbas.p
      ‘Having exchanged (goods) with each other, having exchanged sago, having bought
      (things), they went downstream’
  Or it may indicate that A is identical to addressee, as in 16.95. Here, the Avatip people swore
each other to secrecy.
16.95 awarwa wa-sapwi-wa-sapwi-k              wa-sapwi-tukwa
      rec       say-be.open-say-be.open-dat say-be.open-proh.gen
      ‘As for disclosing (information) to each other, (he said): “do not disclose it” ’
  A similar example is at 16.96—‘be good to each other, treat each other well’. This is an
example of a sequencing form used as a command strategy: this is an instruction to siblings to
look after each other properly (which was particularly important since their youngest brother
had recently died by drowning):
16.96 awarwa r@ka:r@k kur@-n
      rec    properly make/do-seq
      ‘You must be good to each other’ (lit. ‘Doing properly to each other!’)
  The reciprocal may also state the identity between A and a beneﬁciary, as in 16.97a–b:
16.97a [awarwa gwar       taka-ku]      [ata adakw] [wa-b@r]
       rec      ointment put-compl.ss then stay:impv say-3dubas.p
       ‘Having applied ointment to each other, they said “Good bye (lit. stay!)” ’
420     16 Directionals and Valency-Changing Devices16.97b [ban [ñiki da-na-di               ba:n] awarwa væg@t@-ta:y] gwar       atak
       back blood go.down-act.foc-3pl back rec         wipe-cotemp ointment impv+put
       ‘Apply ointment (on) the back, the back on which blood is streaming down, to each
       other’
   A similar example is in 4.31, ‘giving mortuary feast to each other’.
   The reciprocal with an intransitive verb has an implication of multiple participants, and may
imply symmetrical action, as in 16.98. The reciprocal itself does not have to be stated, as in
7.78: the comitative marking makes the reciprocal meaning of ‘quarrelling’ obvious:
16.98 awarwa karanki          t@-na-di
      rec      angry/annoyed have-act.foc-3plbas.vt
      ‘They are annoyed with each other’
I was warned not to go out at night by myself, since I would be in danger because:
16.99 t@p-a-k@-di         du-ta:kw     awarwa kuprap t@-na-di
      village-lk-poss-pl man-woman rec          bad      be/stand-act.foc-3plbas.vt
      ‘Village people are bad to each other (and I could be aﬀected by sorcery)’
  The reciprocal may just state a general symmetrical relationship, ‘between themselves’, as
16.100 (cf. 7.26). These examples involve a transitive verb, ‘take wife; marry’:
16.100 Waskuk Gala awarwa ta:kw kra-di
       Washkuk Gala rec         wife get-3plbas.p
       ‘The Washkuk (and) the Gala intermarried between themselves’ (lit. took wives
       (from/between) each other)
   A similar example is 4.56. This is an explanation of the joking relationship with one’s
brother’s wives. The distributive noun phrase, kajal kajal (sister.in.law (brother’s wife) sis-
ter.in.law), reinforces the reciprocal meaning. The clause refers to a woman making jokes when
face to face with a brother’s wife (as in 5.16) who is a woman of the opposite clan group, and
is not a potential co-wife.
   That is, the reciprocal awarwa can mark any kind of symmetrical relationship independently
of the verb’s transitivity or the semantic roles involved. However, the semantic expectations are
somewhat diﬀerent, depending on the verb’s transitivity.
   The other meaning of awarwa is ‘associative; together’. This meaning is in line with the main
meaning of the comitative (see §7.9). This meaning is attested both with transitive and with
intransitive verbs. Example 16.101 comes from the same story as 16.100—if the Gala had not
been nasty to the Washkuk, they would have carried on marrying each other (16.100), and
building their ‘line’ of descendants together (16.101):
16.101 [k@ta-n-a:b     b@ta:y awarwa wañ ba:p taka-n] [ata kur@-n
       now-pred-too already rec          line row put-seq then do/get-seq
       kwak@-k-na-di]
       seek-fut/irr-act.foc-3plbas.vt
       ‘Now, too, having established (lit. put down) a line, a row (of descendants) together
       already, they would have been seeking to act’
  An intransitive verb with awarwa as an associative marker is shown at 16.102.
16.102 awarwa atawa       r@-di
       rec      like.that sit-3plbas.p
       ‘Like that they stayed all together’
                                                          16.2 Valency-changing devices        421   The two meanings—reciprocal and associative—are not readily distinguishable—in 16.103
either reciprocal or associative sounds plausible. Both readings are given at 16.103.

       ‘Holding hands (lit. having entered their hands), (a) the two were walking stuck
       together or (b) were walking stuck to each other’
  Often only the context determines if the meaning of awarwa is reciprocal or associative.
An example is at 16.104. A man was attacked by a crocodile and was saved by another man,
Kainu, and a few others. Out of context, awarwa lagu- could have meant ‘pull each other’. In
this context, this can only mean ‘pull together’: there was no reciprocality involved, just a joint
eﬀort:

       River by his thigh, it (the bone) would have broken, he would have never come ashore
       again’
  In 16.105, awarwa lagu- has both associative and reciprocal meanings. It describes a dispute
between two boys: they were both pulling the coveted bow and arrow, away from each other:

       rec
       ‘Those two pulled these two (topical) bow and arrow together each away from the
       other’
   In its associative meaning, awarwa is partly synonymous with nakamib ‘together’ (see
§10.6.1), and in fact can even be replaced with it. Example 16.106 was used as a synonym
of 16.100, in an additional explanation of the relationship between the Washkuk and the Gala:
16.106 nakamib ta:kw kra-di
       together wife get-3plbas.p
       ‘They intermarried among themselves (that is, took wives (from/between) each other)’
   Examples like 16.106 bear a distinct similarity to the way wantaim ‘together, with each other’
is used in Tok Pisin. And note that the speaker who said 16.106 as a comment to 16.100 was
judged by others as speaking very ‘carelessly’: his Manambu was peppered with Tok Pisin
code-switches.
   To express a reciprocal and an associative meaning simultaneously, both awarwa and
nakamib are used. Example 16.107 described us taking a picture of each other all together—the
whole big family and neighbours were involved:
16.107 awarwa nakamib kayik kur-k@-bana
       rec      together picture get-fut-1plsubj.vt+3fem.sgbas.vt
       ‘We will take a picture of each other all together’
422     16 Directionals and Valency-Changing Devices   The associative has a strong overtone of ‘togetherness; being next to each other’, especially
in the case of inanimate objects, as in 16.108:
16.108 awarwa kwa-di            kamna:gw ka:n
       rec       stay-3plbas.vt food        eat+seq
       ‘eating foods (which are) next to each other (lying on a smoking grid)’
  The reciprocal/associative awarwa does not occur with singular subjects. And just like most
other adverbs, it can modify a noun. Then, the meaning tends to be associative, with the
overtone of ‘something shared, joint’, as in 16.109–10:
16.109 [awarwa         ma:j] aka                           wa-tua
       rec/together story dem.dist.react.top.fem.sg say-1sgsubj.vt+3fem.sgbas.vt
       ‘I am telling (topical) joint story’ (shared by all Manambu groups)
16.110 [awarwa        gwalugw]
       rec/together clan
       v@-kraki-v@-kraki-al-al
       see-carry.across-see-carry.across-3fem.sgbas.vt-3fem.sgbas.vt
       ‘What it (the story) is is a noticeable sign (symbol) of (our) joint clans’
   However, even here the exact meaning entirely depends on the context. So, awarwa wa:r
(rec boundary/mark) means ‘joint boundary; shared boundary’. But k@-di d@ya-di awarwa
ta:kw (dem.prox-pl they+lk-pl rec woman) means ‘these women who are in a peer group
relationship to each other’, and not ‘women to each other’, or ‘women together’.
   In 16.111, the job of building a house is described as a joint enterprise. Pauline Laki, the
author of this story, translated awarwa ja:p as ‘joint work’ and also as ‘give and take process’.
This indicates the close link between reciprocal and associative meanings of which speakers are
acutely aware.
16.111 wiya       yawi a                     n@mal             a

       awarwa                ja:p-al
       together/each.other thing-3fem.sgnom
       ‘The work on the house is big, it is a thing one does together (or: to each other’)
       Pauline Laki’s literal translation: ‘enormous task of building is also a give and take
       process’
  All these examples show that associative and reciprocal meanings are intertwined, and not
so easy to tease apart. And this is where the reciprocal strategies come into play.
  We can recall, from §16.1.4, that two directionals on one verb, -saki-sala- (outward-‘inward’)
can have a reciprocal overtone (see 16.68). So can the reduplicated directional -tay- ‘sideways
away from speaker’ (see 12.67). Their major meanings have nothing to do with reciprocality.
But they are used as reciprocal strategies (with or without awarwa) as means of avoiding the
associative/reciprocal ambiguity of awarwa.
A further note on awarwa. The noun awar ‘side, sideways direction’ is an inherently locational
noun, and is most often used to indicate location (note that it does not take locative case, which
is natural for a locational noun), as in 16.112:
16.112 awar-d@ka yi:n        v@-k@-tua-d
       side-only go+seq see-fut-1sgsubj.vt-3masc.sgbas.vt
       ‘I will go and look sideways’ (also: in a hidden way)
                                                         16.2 Valency-changing devices        423  The expression awar m@la:r (side eye+lk+instr) means ‘out of the corner of one’s eye, in a
secretive way’. When reduplicated, awar means ‘between (two similar things)’, as in 16.113:
16.113 awar awar ñ@gawa                      r@-na
       side side mosquito.net+lk+com sit-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt
       ‘It (bag) is sitting between the mosquito nets’
  An alternative to awar in 16.113 is the connective aw ‘then, or’ (see §4.5) used when some-
thing is located between two diﬀerent objects, as in 16.114. Senapian was not on the map, but
Mali suggested that it should be between Swakap and Ambunti:
16.114 aw Swakap aw Ambunti, aw ñ@d@m
       then Swakap then Ambunti then middle+lk+loc
       r@-k-na
       sit-fut/irr-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt
       ‘It (Senapian) should be between Swakap and Ambunti, in the middle’
   An etymological connection between awar and aw is possible, but tenuous. Had aw been
anything other than a connective, one could have hypothesized that awar is formed of aw plus
the instrumental -(a)r .
   In contrast to the reciprocal-associative, there is no dedicated reﬂexive. The reﬂexive-
emphatic ka:p ‘alone, by itself’ is used as a reﬂexive strategy. The emphatic meaning (by oneself)
and the reﬂexive meaning are diﬃcult to tease apart—see 16.69a and 16.70a. Both occur in
clauses with animate and with inanimate subjects.
   Another way of expressing a reﬂexive-emphatic meaning is with a reduplicated personal
pronoun—see §10.1, and especially example 10.11.
   An additional emphatic strategy involves the adverb ma:k ‘in person; face to face; oneself’:
16.115 n@n-a:m             ma:k   v@-k@-tua
       you.fem-lk+acc in.person see-fut-1sgsubj.vt+3fem.sgbas.vt
       ‘I will see you in person’
  This form can co-occur with a reciprocal-associative, as shown in 16.116. The referent of
ma:k can be coreferential with the subject. So far, ma:k has not been attested in a purely
reﬂexive meaning.
16.116 awarwa ma:k         ma: v@
       rec      in.person neg see:neg
       ‘(We) haven’t seen each other in person/ourselves’
         17         Complex Predicates
Manambu has a variety of complex predicates which consist of more than one grammatical
and phonological word. These include:
    (i) complex predicates containing auxiliaries—see §17.1;
   (ii) complex predicates containing support verbs—see §17.2; and
  (iii) lexicalized complex predicates—see §17.3.
  Body part and part–whole clausal constructions (referred to as ‘body part constructions’ and
‘part–whole constructions’ for short) share similarities with complex predicates—see §17.4.
Transitivity-neutralizing constructions which involve clause-chaining markers (§16.2.3) are
semantically akin to aspectual complex predicates; see §17.5. Complex predicates involving
repetition of the verb were discussed in §12.8.3. A comparison of complex predicates is in
§17.6.
  We can recall, from B under §4.2.2, that Manambu has ten polyfunctional verbs used as an
auxiliary or as a support verb, and as copulas (see Table 4.1). The bulk of this chapter focuses
on discussion of these verbs.
  Polyfunctional verbs in (i) and (ii) have a grammatical role to play. Auxiliaries impart
aspectual or modal meanings to the whole construction, and also serve as carriers for various
inﬂections. Support verbs simply serve as inﬂection carriers. A complex predicate can contain
not more than one occurrence of the same polyfunctional verb in a grammatical function,
and only one non-inﬂected component. That is, an auxiliary is usually incompatible with
a construction already containing the same verb as a support verb. Two support verbs can
occasionally occur together (as in 17.36a–b). A nominal component of a complex predicate can
never be focused. Some can be questioned—see §§17.2–3. Components of complex predicates
are underlined throughout this chapter.
              17.1 c o m p l e x p r e d i c at e s c o n ta i n i n g au x i l i a r i e sAuxiliaries are deﬁned as a closed subclass of verbs which (a) form part of one complex
predicate in combination with an uninﬂected verb from a large open class; (b) take all the
person, number, gender, aspect, tense, mood, and modality speciﬁcations required; and (c)
impart a modal or aspectual meaning to the construction. There are no restrictions on the
transitivity of the lexical verb.
   Complex predicates containing auxiliaries cannot contain stative verbs or non-verbal pred-
icate heads. As we can recall from Table 4.1, four of the polyfunctional verbs are used as
auxiliaries. The positional verbs t@- ‘stand’, r@- ‘sit’, and kwa- ‘stay’ mark anterior and durative
aspects in complex predicates. (They are glossed as ‘stand’, ‘sit’, and ‘stay’ in their auxiliary and
support verb functions throughout this chapter.) Aspectual complex predicates consist of a
lexical verb marked with the manner sequencing suﬃx -n and an auxiliary. Aspectual complex
predicates are discussed in §17.1.1. The verb kur- ‘do, get, become (fully)’ marks imminent
                                         17.1 Complex predicates containing auxiliaries          425modality in combination with the same-subject purposive or the desiderative form of a lexical
verb (§17.1.2).
   Complex predicates discussed in this section can be used in a main and in a dependent clause.
An additional type of complex predicate with temporal meaning is restricted to dependent
clauses. It consists of a verb marked with the sequential -n and the generic completive verb
napa- accompanied by the appropriate clause-chaining markers (as in 17.25b)—see §18.9.
Modal complex predicates of yet another type consist of one of the two modal verbs both
meaning ‘be able to, can’ followed by an inﬂected verb. These complex predicates cannot be
negated, questioned, or occur in a command; neither can they take any of the modalities
discussed in Chapter 13. (See §4.5.1.)                   17.1.1 Aspectual and positional complex predicatesAspectual complex predicates express (A) anterior aspect, (B) durative aspect, and (C) pro-
longed durative aspect. The polyfunctional verbs which occur in all three aspectual complex
predicates are also used as positional verbs. In these constructions, they tend to be bleached
of their positional meanings. We will see, under (B), that this bleaching is incomplete, and that
positional verbs sometimes retain their meanings to do with ‘standing’ and ‘sitting’. Since their
choice does not correlate with the shape or any other inherent property of the referent, they
cannot be considered classiﬁcatory (see Aikhenvald 2000: 159–66, on classiﬁcatory verbs in
New Guinea languages).
A. An anterior complex predicate consists of the auxiliary t@- preceded by the verb from
an open class marked with the sequential -@n. It refers to an action which may be completed
by the time of speech act, and remains relevant for the present. The focus is on the result of
an action, as is the case with other aspectual complex predicates. The action itself may, or may
not, extend to the present; it is its result that has to be relevant for the present (as in 12.71, ‘I
have completely forgotten (it)’).
   This is illustrated in 17.1, with the verb v@- ‘see/look’. The action of ‘seeing/looking’ started
prior to the timing of the main line of the story, and continues to be relevant for the rest of the
story because the people keep looking at what is happening.17.1 [a-d@             v@-s@mul-d@-k]                      [day du ta:kw ata væn

     dem.dist-masc.sg key+lk+dat look.for-seq stand-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt
     ‘She (the hen) has been looking for that key ever since’  An anterior complex predicate can appear in a dependent clause, as in 17.3. Kuimagan keeps
holding the baby in his arms while his wife Sirunki goes oﬀ into the bush. The action expressed
with a complex predicate (yata-n t@- (carry-seq stand-) ‘to have been carrying’) started before
Sirunki had gone oﬀ to the bush, and is continuing while she is in the bush.
426     17 Complex Predicates17.3 [Kuimagan Lai ata yata-d@-d],                                   [yata-n

     ‘Then Kuimagan held Lai (in his arms), as he was carrying him, Sirunki went inside (the
     bush)’
   The auxiliary in an aspectual complex predicate can be marked for future and for desidera-
tive modality, as illustrated in 17.4.
   In the second line, the form t@-d@-k (stand-3masc.sg-compl.ds) is an example of a head-tail
linkage whereby only the inﬂected, auxiliary, part of the complex predicate gets repeated (see
§20.4.1):
17.4 [g@ñ@r yi-ku         k@d@ka                          væn       ta:d]

     ‘Having gone oﬀ later, he had been looking (at the woman), having been looking (at her),
     “I will come with an intention of keeping on looking at her”, the man said’
The ways in which the anterior complex predicate is negated, and the issues of contiguity
in non-habitual negative anterior, were discussed in §14.1.3. Examples 14.32–3 illustrate the
semantic diﬀerence between negative anterior constructions with the declarative non-habitual
negator ma: preceding the whole construction, or just the auxiliary. If the negator precedes the
auxiliary, this implies negative anterior reading: something has not happened in the past, and
this remains relevant for the moment of speech. If the negator precedes the whole construction,
the implication is a complete lack of experience.
   A negative habitual anterior is shown in 14.49—here the habitual negator ak@s obligatorily
precedes the whole complex predicate. The meaning is ‘I have never been taking antibiotics’.
An example of positive habitual anterior is at 12.67.
   The intensive (marked via a full reduplication of the verb root) can occur in a complex
predicate with auxiliary (see §12.8.2 and §17.1.2). No modality other than the desiderative has
been attested with any of the aspectual complex predicates. Neither can the customary aspect
discussed in Chapter 12 co-occur with an aspectual complex predicate. The reasons for this are
purely formal. We can recall, from §12.7, that the customary aspect requires t@- as a support
verb to carry the necessary person-number-gender inﬂections (see §12.7 and §17.2), since it is
an uninﬂected verb. And the same verb used as a support verb and an auxiliary cannot occur
in one complex predicate.
   A complex predicate with an auxiliary can occur in a command, albeit rarely. There are no
instances of anterior commands in the corpus. We can recall, from §13.2.1, that the polyfunc-
tional verbs t@- and r@- share the suppletive imperative ada. However, all the examples with ada
as part of a complex predicate have a distinct durative meaning, and thus reﬂect the auxiliary
r@- —see B below.
B. A durative complex predicate consists of the auxiliary r@- preceded by the verb from an
open class marked with the sequential -@n. The focus is on the result of an action, as is the case
with other aspectual complex predicates. A durative complex predicate can have past, non-past,
and future reference—see 17.5–6. Further examples are at 16.88 and 16.91–2.
                                         17.1 Complex predicates containing auxiliaries        42717.5 Japan-adi       ya-n       r@-di

     I      maternal.uncle-pl house+lk+loc go.up-seq sit-fut-act.foc-1masc.sgbas.vt
     ‘I will keep going up to the house of my maternal uncles’
  A durative complex predicate can combine with a construction containing the suﬃx -d@ka
‘only’. We can recall, from §12.8.1, that an uninﬂected verb marked with -d@ka can be accompa-
nied by an inﬂected form of the same root, to express persistence and continuity of an activity,
as in 12.50 and 17.7:
17.7 mikuli     wa-d@ka wa-n      r@-na
     complaint say-only say-seq sit-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt
     ‘She keeps only complaining all the time’
  A durative complex predicate occurs in commands, as shown in 17.8 (continuation of 17.1:
the younger brother commands the people to keep looking). Note the suppletive imperative
ada which could belong to either t@- or r@- (§13.2.1). The durative semantics of the construction
indicates that ada is a form of r@-:
17.8 [væn     ada]
     see+seq stand:impv
     ‘Keep looking’
   In the instances discussed so far, the positional verbs t@- and r@- employed as auxiliaries
appear to be bleached of their meanings ‘stand’ and ‘sit’ respectively. However, this is not
always the case. Some actions have a typical position associated with them. For instance, the
verb kap@- ‘wait’ is associated with sitting position, and as a result a durative complex predicate
in 17.9 receives an alternative interpretation as ‘she is sitting (for a long time) waiting’:
17.9 l@-k@              du-a:k         kap@-n r@-na
     she-obl+fem.sg man-lk+dat wait-seq sit-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt
     ‘She is sitting waiting for her husband’ or ‘She is waiting for her husband’
  The two positional verbs ‘stand’ and ‘sit’ preceded by a verb referring to a position in
space—such as ‘be standing’ and ‘go down’—each marked with the sequential -@n, form
complex predicates with positional, rather than aspectual, meanings. As shown in 13.1, da:n
r@- (go.down+seq sit) means ‘sit down, be seated’—also see 17.10.
17.10 ada                           da:n           r@-na-d
      dem.dist.react.top+masc.sg go.down+seq sit-act.foc-3masc.sgbas.vt
      sayi:m
      boy’s.house+lk+loc
      ‘He (topical) sat down (or was sitting down) in boy’s house’
   A complex predicate ras@-n t@- (stand.up-seq stand) often means ‘stand up, be standing’ (as
in 13.2), rather than having an expected anterior reading. The verb ras@- often has an anterior
reading in its other meanings, ‘get up’ and ‘grow up’. An anterior complex predicate da:n t@-
(go.down+seq stand-) would mean ‘have gone down’; in contrast, ∗ ras@-n r@- (stand.up-seq sit)
does not make sense since, as I was told, ‘one cannot stand up and sit down at the same time’.
428     17 Complex Predicates  The positional semantics of ‘sit’ and ‘stand’ appears to be maintained in complex predicates
by analogy with copula clauses and constructions with a support verb—see §17.2 (especially
examples 17.39–40).
C. A prolonged durative complex predicate consists of the verb kwa- ‘stay’ preceded by a
verb from an open class marked with the sequential -@n. It describes an action which goes on
for a long time, longer than the one described with the durative complex predicate. In 17.11, a
prolonged durative complex predicate describes a situation that persisted for a long time.
17.11 day tayir k@-d@                    t@p      warya-n kwa-di
      they before dem.prox-masc.sg village ﬁght-seq stay-3plbas.vt/p
      ‘Before they, (the inhabitants of) this village, kept on and on ﬁghting’
  A speciﬁc time frame is stated in T2.41: a prolonged action which involved looking after
a captured Gala man took the Manambu man two weeks. Like other aspectual complex
predicates, the prolonged durative predicate can occur with future, as in 17.12:
17.12 [ñ@n a-k@s],     [wun kur@-n                 kwa-k@-tua]
      you impv-catch I        take.care.of/do-seq stay-fut-1sgsubj.vt+3fem.sgbas.vt
      ‘You catch (shrimp), I will keep looking (after the baby)’
  It is instructive to compare the aspectual complex predicate with prolonged durative mean-
ing with the habitual aspect (§12.3 and examples 12.20–1). We can recall that the marker
of the habitual is likely to be etymologically related to the polyfunctional verb kwa- ‘stay’;
however, synchronically habitual is quite diﬀerent from other aspects, and from any of the verb
compounding structures. The habitual aspect does not combine with the durative complex
predicates. The habitual aspect does not combine with future: a future habitual meaning can
only be expressed with a complex predicate involving the verb kwa- ‘stay’. That is, 17.12 has an
additional meaning ‘I will habitually look after the baby’ (cf. 12.20). Here, the habitual and the
durative meanings can only be disambiguated by context.
  An aspectual complex predicate can contain two lexical verbs if they describe aspects of the
same action, as in 17.13a, b:
17.13a da:n          war@-n    ta:d
       go.down+seq go.up-seq stand+3masc.sgbas.vt/p
       ‘He has been going up and down’
17.13b da:n          war@-n    kwa:d
       go.down+seq go.up-seq stay+3masc.sgbas.vt/p
       ‘He keeps going up and down’
This is similar to complex predicates with the completive verb napa- (§18.9), but not to any
other complex predicate, including the imminent modality described in §17.1.2.","[445, 446, 447, 448, 449, 450, 451, 452, 453, 454, 455]"
" 3 A full list of clans and their totems is outside the scope of this grammar (and is a matter of contention among the
Manambu speakers themselves).
76     4 Word Classes   Address terms can be gender sensitive; for instance yab@n, yaban is a term of address for men
of the Maliau clan, and yab@nay is its correspondent for women. The form yab@nay is also a
name for the Iatmul clans which are totemically the same as the Maliau clan; this term has no
other meaning in Manambu. The same address term can be used for men and for women: for
instance, tapwuk ‘chicken’, gawi ‘eagle’, and wud@b ‘spirit’ can be used to address both men
and women from the Nabul clan.
   Address forms are illustrated in 4.5–6. In 4.5 a cassowary (who has shed her skin and become
a beautiful young woman) is addressed in the way appropriate for a member of the Sarak clan,
to which she belongs, since the cassowary is its totem. This is said by a man who has just stolen
and hidden her skin, and is going to marry the cassowary-woman.4.5 mæy-a           Apwi              Manab ñ@n-a           s@p

    ‘Come, the one of Sarak clan, your skin is here’  In 4.6, two diﬀerent address forms are used to one person. The more address forms one
knows and uses, the more elaborate one is as a speaker, and the addressee is likelier to listen to
what one has to say.4.6 a-kamal         ya    akr@l    Yaban

    ‘Do come back, where are you going, Yaban (the one of the Maliau clan), come, Jamal’  The address forms such as the ones shown in 4.5–6 can be used as vocatives. They can also
be heads of intransitive predicates and copula complements: to say that someone is of the
Vali:k clan, one can say: kanukaraki-a (death.adder-3fem.sgnom) ‘she is (to be addressed as)
“death adder” (a totem of the Vali:k clan)’. They are not used in any other function, and can
be considered a marginal subclass of nominals, restricted in their morphological and syntactic
possibilities.
  The general ‘goodwill’ address term k@ p, plural k@pugw ‘my dear’ stands apart from all
other address terms. It is used exclusively as a term of address in farewells, greetings, and
expressions of best wishes, and is noun-like only in the way the plural is derived (see §6.1). It
can be considered a defective noun (see §21.2.2). (Since it cannot be modiﬁed, or used as an
argument, its gender is impossible to establish: see §5.2.)
  Deverbal action nominalizations are derived via CV/CCV and CVCV reduplication of the
verbal root (the choice depends on the root structure; further discussion of nominalizations,
their argument structure and meanings is in §§9.1.1–2). They can occur in the S function, as in
4.7 (‘be diﬃcult’) and 4.8 (‘ﬁnish’).4.7 d@-k@-m            kawar-kawar suan       yi-na

They are used as complementation strategies—see §19.8. Unlike other nouns, but just like
verbs, nominalizations can be modiﬁed by nouns in local cases, e.g. t@p-a kudir nas-@-nas
(village-lk language+all count-lk-count) ‘counting in the village language’, but not by adjec-
tives. A nominalization can modify a noun, e.g. tabu-tabu wa:l (escape-red rain) ‘a passing
rain, lit. a rain running away’. Nominalizations do not take any verbal morphology.
   A subclass of nominals can occur only as copula complements, e.g. bwiyabwi ‘heat’ (copula
na-) and suan ‘diﬃculty’ (copula yi-). These also include terms for weather and times of day,
e.g. kat@lam ‘dawn’, and onomatopoeia, e.g. rou rou rou ‘growling sound’ (both occur with the
copula na-). Unlike other nouns (except for the address term k@ p) the gender of these nominals
is impossible to establish, since they cannot be heads of NPs or arguments other than copula
complements.
   They cannot take any nominal (or other) morphological markers. Just a few can be used as
modiﬁers. For instance, the form s@pis@pi ‘drizzle, drizzly’ typically occurs with a copula na-,
as in s@pis@pi na-k-na (drizzle be:nat-fut-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt) ‘it will drizzle’. It can also
be used as a modiﬁer to the only noun with which it is semantically compatible: s@pis@pi wa:l
(drizzle rain) ‘drizzling rain’, and as a modiﬁer to a verb, as in wa:l s@pis@pi væker-na (rain
drizzle fall-act.foc+3fem.sgbas) ‘the rain is falling in a drizzly way’.
   This is a potentially open class, since it comprises loans like bisi ‘busy’, isi ‘easy’, stati ‘start’,
save ‘know, knowledge’ (from Tok Pisin bisi, isi, stati, and save) or les ‘lazy, unwilling’ (from
Tok Pisin les). These always occur as copula complements, with a copula/support verb yi-
or t@- (see §17.2.2), e.g. stati t@-na-wun (start ‘stand’-act.foc-1sgbas.vt) ‘I start’, ma: save
t@ (neg know ‘stand’:neg) ‘(I/you/she/he, etc.) don’t know’, and 22.35. They never occur as
verbs, despite the fact that, as we will see in §4.2, Manambu is not averse to borrowing
verbs.
   Nouns of physical states are similar: they typically occur as copula complements, with
polyfunctional verbs (see §4.2.2 and §17.2), e.g. ka:m ‘hunger’ (copula yasa-/yas@-), n@k@r ‘cold’
(copula tay-). However, most of them can also take the dative case, be heads of possessive con-
structions, and occur with derivational suﬃxes, e.g. sad@ka (sleep+only) ‘(process of sleeping)
only’. A few can occur with more than one polyfunctional verb with a meaning diﬀerence, e.g.
s@ ‘sleep’ with the copula yasa-/yas@- means ‘be sleepy’, and with the copula kwa- means ‘sleep,
be asleep’. These nouns can be assigned variable gender depending on the ‘degree’ of quality
they express (masculine gender goes with a stronger degree, and feminine gender with a weaker
degree—see §5.2).
   A number of deverbal aspectual forms (e.g. -j@b@r ‘customary aspect’: §12.7) and modal
forms (e.g. desiderative -k@r (§13.5) and frustrative -p and -(ya)k@ p (§13.6) ) appear to be more
nominal than verbal. First, they do not take any verbal cross-referencing or verbal sequencing
suﬃxes. Secondly, to express tense, or to be used in a non-main clause, these forms have to
occur as complements of the support verb t@- ‘be, stand’, as illustrated in 4.9.4.9 v@-k@ta-k@p t@-k-na-d
    see-try-fr be/stand-fut-act.foc-3masc.sgbas.vt
    ‘He will be trying to see in vain’4.10 ga:m ata s@-na                           s@-p    s@-p     s@-p   t@-ku

     ‘She called, having then called many times in vain (she stepped and went up onto the dry

78     4 Word Classes  These forms do not have any nominal grammatical categories, and cannot occur in any
syntactic function other than a copula complement. Since they express essentially verbal
categories and have verbal argument structure, we will consider them in the chapters dealing
with verbal morphology (Chapters 11–13).
                                          4.2 v e r b s                           4.2.1 Verbal grammatical categoriesVerbs are an open class. They constitute the most complicated part of the Manambu grammar,
from the point of view of both the richness of grammatical categories, and of morphophono-
logical complexity. That verbs are an open class is corroborated by the facility Manambu
appears to have in adopting verbs as loans. We saw in §4.1.2 that verb roots are often borrowed
as nominals, and then used as copula complements. Verbal roots can also be borrowed as
verbs, and then take all the appropriate verbal morphology. It is hard to determine whether
these are established loans, or occasional nonce loans, e.g. a-pas (impv-tie) ‘tie!’, pasi-tua ‘I
tied’ (from Tok Pisin pasim ‘tie’), a-tik (impv-tick) ‘tick!’ Whether to borrow a verb as a
verb, or as a nominal employed as a copula complement of the verb t@-, is often speaker’s
choice (see Aikhenvald forthcoming c). The Tok Pisin verb kamap ‘take place, occur, get up’
is frequently used as a full verb in Manambu, e.g. kamap@-d ‘he got up, (it) happened’. The
same root can be borrowed as a copula complement of the verb t@-, as in kamap@ ta:d (get.up
‘stand’+3masc.sgbas.vt) ‘He got up (became ﬁne)’. Loan verbs integrated into the language
and used by most speakers include sali- ‘send’ (Tok Pisin salim), laiki- ‘like’ (Tok Pisin laikim),
puti- ‘put’ (Tok Pisin putim), paini- ‘ﬁnd’ (Tok Pisin painim), and lukauti- ‘look after’ (Tok
Pisin lukautim) (despite the attempts of the proponents of ‘pure’ Manambu to get rid of
them).
   Verbal categories include personal cross-referencing, action focus, tense, aspect (Chapter 12),
moods and modalities (Chapter 13), and verbal negation (Chapter 14). Verb compounding is
employed for valency increase, and to express an array of aspectual and directional meanings—
see Chapter 15. Verbs take a set of directional aﬃxes (see §16.1). A non-productive transi-
tivizing preﬁx derives a morphological causative (see §16.2). Verbs—unlike any other word
classes—can occur in the predicate slot of subordinate clauses (without requiring a support
verb: see Chapters 18 and 19). Verbs fall into at least ﬁve classes depending on root type and
vowel alternations in non-stressed syllables within the verbal paradigm. These are discussed in
§11.3.","[102, 103, 104, 105]"

  22.6.2 The ‘Manambu revival’ movement and perspectives for language survivalA notable feature of the language attitude among many Manambu is the discourse of ‘nostal-
gia’. When I ﬁrst arrived in the village and started explaining what I was doing, the general
response was: yes, we do need a linguist, because our language might die (ñan-a kudi kus@-
k-na (we-lk+fem.sg language ﬁnish-irr-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt) ). This attitude, which goes
together with strong preference for ‘the old ways’ of speech, has some similarities to what
Hill (1998) described as the ‘discourse of nostalgia’, for the bilingual communities around the
Malinche volcano in central Mexico. Like speakers of Nahuatl, speakers of Manambu contrast
the linguistic ‘purity’ of ‘long ago’ with ‘the language mixing’ of ‘today’; they also strive to
be as close as possible to the ‘long ago’ ideal in their language monitoring. The discourse of
nostalgia among many city-dwelling Manambu speakers extends to Tok Pisin (wali kudi, lit.
‘white people language’). They lament that not only do their children have no knowledge of
Manambu (and little desire to acquire this knowledge); they do not even speak or understand
Tok Pisin.
   Obsolescence of the true Manambu language is an object of concern for most senior people
in the village, and also a few younger people in their thirties and forties. A number of purists—
most of whom are successful middle-class urban-dwellers—are trying their best to exclude Tok
Pisin and English loans and instead invent indigenous terms. We saw numerous examples in
§22.5 above.
   Discourse of nostalgia could be a dangerous sign—it often indicates that the language is well
and truly on its way out. There are, however, indications that speakers do value Manambu and
are not prepared to just let it go. Within the urban communities, Manambu is employed as
a sort of ‘secret language’ and an in-group means of communication emblematic in itself. In
the village context, one frequently hears mothers shouting at children ‘Say this in the village
language, don’t speak white language (Tok Pisin)!’ (see 21.28a, b). Children who are proﬁcient
in Manambu feel valued. It was a matter of particular pride for 11-year-old Tanina to be able
to correct her mothers and grandmothers whenever they let slip a Tok Pisin word. No matter
how much Tok Pisin she uses herself, she is a language revivalist in the making.
   Manambu remains an emblematic language for the people it ‘belongs’ to. Hardly any young
people know as many totemic terms as they could be expected to; but many make it a point
to learn at least some correct greetings: this is seen to enhance their status in the community.
Even ardent Christians who otherwise reject traditional rituals as ‘heretical’ adhere to these
624      22 Genetic and Areal Relationshipstraditional patterns as emblematic of their Manambu identity and their place in the village
clan and kinship system.
   People vary in the extent of their concern about the fact that children tend to speak Tok
Pisin. Some are convinced—and perhaps rightly so—that their children will acquire proﬁciency
in Manambu. See Janet’s observation that her daughter—whose ﬁrst language is Tok Pisin—
will be speaking Manambu and Tok Pisin together in no time at all (4.73).
   And despite the disquieting fact that little Joana spoke only Tok Pisin as her ﬁrst language,
Janet’s predictions may well come true. Joana is frequently left in the care of Janet’s mother
Lowai and elder sister Dora—both elaborate and proﬁcient speakers of Manambu, just like
Janet herself. That Tanina, Kerryanne, Celestin, and Stevie are good at Manambu, and that
Tanina has already grown to be an excellent story teller, is in large part due to the fact that the
children live in the same house with Gemaj, one of the best speakers and connoisseurs of lore.
The survival of the language lies in the hands of these mature-age women and their charges.
   A number of cultural and economic trends in modern-day Papua New Guinea could also
be favourable to slowing down the process of impending language shift, and improving the
perspective for language survival.
   The sheer prestige of Manambu speakers—such as Paul Badaibæg Kat, Eric Yuamalen, John
Sepaywus, Kulanawi, and others—in a larger Sepik context helps maintain the high prestige of
the language and of the traditional knowledge. Avatip is lucky in having Leo Yabwi Luma, a
highly knowledgeable and respected man and an elaborate connoisseur of the language and of
the tradition, as the headmaster of its primary school.
   Within a broader context, the fact that many members of the urban elite in the cities are
Manambu provides further appreciation of those who know the language and the lore. Just
a few examples. Lieutenant-Colonel James Laki is a major expert on security issues in Papua
New Guinea and worldwide; Colonel David Takendu is an ex-High-Commissioner to New
Zealand; Joel Yuakalu Luma occupies a high position in the government. The current Ambas-
sador to the Philippines and the Chief of Staﬀ of Papua New Guinea army are Manambu. A
growing number of the Manambu acquire higher degrees overseas and return to their country
to work in universities and various companies.
   These people create role-models for the new generation—those who want to be ‘like uncle
Leo’, or ‘like uncle Joel’, would try and learn at least some Manambu to maintain their status
in the village and outside it.
   Some of the retiring urban elite go back to the village. This has already brought another
inﬂux of interest and culture revival into the village. The activity of an overseas linguist and
an overseas anthropologist each working with highly respected Manambu speakers boosts the
prestige of the language as a means of day-to-day communication; this has already initiated
a community-based project of Manambu language and culture documentation and teaching
(see Hornberger and King 2000: 185 on the importance of such activities in the context of
Quechua language maintenance). The ‘revival’ of Manambu school programme is now under
way, under the leadership of Leo Luma. Despite dangerous signs of obsolescence, one should
not be pessimistic: the language may well live on.

                 4.3.2 Adjectives in comparison with nouns and verbsTable 4.2 features a comparison of morphological and syntactic properties for nouns, verbs,
and adjectives. We saw, in §3.1, that members of any word class can head a one-place predicate
in declarative and interrogative main clauses. Then, verbs use verbal sets of person marking
(Tables 3.1–2), while other word classes use the ‘nominal set’ (Table 3.4). Only verbs can head
a predicate in a non-declarative clause, or in a temporal or conditional subordinate clause.
Other word classes require a copula/support verb in these contexts. Any word class can be
focused (see §§11.1–2 and §20.3). The diﬀerences between verbal and non-verbal roots were
summarized in Table 2.3. Only verbal roots have unpredictable vowel alternations (see §11.3).
1. Negation is marked diﬀerently for verbal and non-verbal heads of a predicate; these also
diﬀer in how tense distinctions are expressed. See §§14.1.1–2, for a discussion.
2. Compounding is productive for verbs, and is used to express a number of meanings,
including aspectual, valency changing, manner, sequencing, and complete involvement, e.g. k@-
yak@- (eat-throw) ‘eat fully, eat up’, vægru-yak@- (get.together-throw) ‘get together (all people)
(see §15.3). Verb-noun compounds can be considered functional equivalents of relative clauses
if the noun is not speciﬁc, e.g. kiya-du (die-man) ‘dead man’, kiya-d-@ du (die-3masc.sgbas.p-
lk man) ‘a/the man who died’—see §19.2.2. Noun compounding is extremely productive, e.g.
ap-a-t@ p (bone-lk-village) ‘Avatip (the main village)’ (see §9.3).
   Agreeing adjectives cannot be part of a compound. Other adjectives can form nominal-like
compounds, e.g. væk-a-kru (pot-lk-fat) ‘fat as a pot’ in 4.55, or wi-a-kru (house-lk-fat) ‘thick,

96     4 Word Classeswide as a house’. The adjective vyak@t ‘good’ is unusual in that it forms a compound with -yak@
‘throw’ as a second component, as if it were a verb, e.g. vyak@ta-yak@ n@b-a ta:kw (good-throw
young.female-lk woman) ‘very beautiful young woman’.
3. Reduplication can be partial only for verbs (see §9.1.1 and §12.8.2). Just one noun has a
partially reduplicated form: jija:p ‘things, belongings’ formed on ja:p ‘thing’. Full reduplication
results in diﬀerent meanings with diﬀerent word classes. With verbs, full reduplication marks:
  (i) action nominalizations, e.g. nas(@)- ‘count (verb)’, nas@nas ‘counting (noun)’ (§§9.1.1–2);
 (ii) intensive, continuous, or durative aspectual meanings (§12.8.2).
   Full reduplication of a noun has distributive meaning, as in nabi-nabi (year-year) ‘every
year’, t@ p-a-t@ p ‘every village’, gwalugw-u gwalugw-u ma:j (clan-lk clan-lk story) ‘story which
goes from one clan to another’, sad-@-sad (manner-lk-manner) ‘various ways; every way’,
tamiy-a-tami: (area-lk-area) ‘every area, every place’. In a reciprocal construction, full redu-
plication conveys the meaning of ‘to one another’, as in 4.56.
4.56 awarwa r@k kur-na-bran                    kajal-kajal
     rec      joke make-act.foc-1dubas.vt brother’s.wife-brother’s.wife
     ‘We make jokes to/about each other, from brother’s wife to brother’s wife’ (an explanation
     of joking relationship with one’s brother’s wives) (also see 5.16)
   With all agreeing adjectives, full reduplication has intensive meaning, e.g. kwasa-kwasa-
di kami (little-little-pl ﬁsh) ‘very small ﬁsh’, kwasa-kwasa-di gwalugw (little-little-pl clan) ‘very
small clans’; n@ma-n@ma-di kami: (big-big-pl ﬁsh) ‘very big ﬁsh’. Some non-agreeing adjectives
can also undergo full reduplication, with the same intensive meaning, e.g. a-di vyak@t-vyak@t-a
ta:kw (dem.dist-pl good-red-lk woman) ‘those very good women’, ñiki-ñiki ñan (red-red
child) ‘a very pink baby’, g@r ‘small’, g@r -g@r ‘tiny’. Other non-agreeing adjectives derive
intensive forms via full reduplication and the inﬁx -ka-—see 5 below.
   The non-agreeing adjective kula ‘new, raw (food)’ has a partially unpredictable meaning,
when reduplicated: kulakul means ‘naive, unknowing (e.g. about a person who has come
somewhere for the ﬁrst time)’.
4. Semantics of -p@k ‘more or less, comparative’ varies depending on the class of its host
word (see further discussion in §9.2). With nouns, verbs, some non-agreeing adjectives (and
also numerals, pronouns, adverbs) the suﬃx -p@k ‘approximative’ means ‘about; more; more
or less like this’, e.g. v@tiy-a-p@k (two-lk-like) ‘more or less two’; takwa ñan-a-p@k (woman+lk
child-lk-like) ‘someone who is more or less like a girl’. With the agreeing dimension adjectives,
this suﬃx implies comparison. The standard of comparison is not overtly expressed, and the
idea of comparison is understood from the context, as in 4.51.
   The suﬃx -p@k has comparative meaning with non-agreeing adjectives referring to value,
size, and age, e.g. apar-p@k-a ñan (adult-compar-lk child) ‘an older child’, vyak@t- p@k-a val
(good-compar-lk canoe/car) ‘a better car (than other cars)’, s@mi-p@k-a wapwi (long-compar-
lk clothing) ‘a piece of clothing longer than another one’. It is hardly ever used with colour
adjectives.
5. The infix -ka- ‘intensive’ is used with most non-agreeing adjectives, and also with some
nouns. The root of an adjective or of a noun undergoes full reduplication, and the inﬁx (which
requires a linker) is inserted between the two reduplicated parts, e.g. pa:p ‘short’, papa-ka-pa:p
‘very short’; kru ‘fat’, kru-k(u)a-kru ‘very fat’; væs ‘yellow, green (colour of grass)’, væs@-ka-væs
‘very yellow’; g@l ‘black’, gla-ka-g@l ‘very black’; s@mi ‘long’, s@mi-ka-s@mi ‘very long’; t@pwi
                                                                                            4.3 Adjectives          97‘broad’, t@p(w)i-ka-t@pwi ‘very broad’; 5 juwi-ka-juwi ‘brown’ (Yambon dialect: Farnsworth and
Farnsworth 1966). This process also applies to loans, e.g. blu ‘blue’, blu-ka-blu ‘very blue’. The
adjective kuprap ‘bad’ forms an irregular derivation k@pr@-ka-kuprap ‘very bad’.
   Adjectives which can take -ka- cannot undergo full reduplication without it. The only
exception is the adjective kuprap ‘bad’: an alternative intensive form of kuprap involves an echo
compound kuprap@-saprap ‘really bad’ (§9.3). Adjectives which undergo full reduplication (see
4 above) cannot take -ka-; these include vyak@t ‘good’, ñiki ‘red’, and a few others.
   An additional connotation of the -ka- derivation with adjectives involves ‘all over, every-
where’. To refer to a sequence of samples of black colour on a colour chart, 10-year-old Celestin
explained:
4.57 k@-l@-m                karya-r@b g@l-a-ka-g@l-adi
     dem.prox-fem.sg-loc carry-fully black-lk-int-black-3plnom
     ‘Right up until here they are all black all over’
   A few nouns also occur fully reduplicated with the inﬁx -ka-. Some of these formations are
used as non-agreeing modiﬁers only, e.g. s@p ‘skin’, s@p-@-ka-s@ p (skin-lk-int-skin) ‘skinny,
thin, ﬂat’; ap ‘bone’, ap-a-ka-ap ‘very thin; bone-like’; 6 laki ‘ginger’, laki-ka-laki ‘green as
ginger’ (also see §9.1.2). Other such formations have an intensive meaning, e.g. ya:l ‘stomach,
belly’, yal-a-ka-ya:l (stomach-lk-int-stomach) ‘stomach and nothing else, empty stomach’, as
in 4.58; and the nominal suan ‘hard’, e.g. suan-@-ka-suan (hard-lk-int-hard) ‘very hard’.
4.58 yala-ka-yala:m                   r@-tukwa
     stomach+lk-int-stomach+lk+loc sit-proh.gen
     ‘Don’t stay on an empty stomach’
6. Modifier to a verb is a syntactic function typical for three agreeing adjectives (see §4.3.1
and examples there). Non-agreeing dimension adjectives can modify verbs directly, e.g. s@mi r@-
(long sit-) ‘stay for a long time’. Alternatively, a non-agreeing adjective may be adverbialized
(see §4.4):
4.59 s@mir      yi-k@-na-wun
     far+der go-fut-act.foc-1fem.sgbas.vt
     ‘I will go far’
  Value and age adjectives can be used as modiﬁers only if they form one NP with the noun
sa:d ‘manner, way’, e.g. kuprap@ sa:d ‘bad way; badly’. Nouns cannot be used as modiﬁers to
verbs, with a possible exception of sa:d ‘way’. 7
7. Modifier to another adjective is a syntactic function restricted to the two agreeing dimen-
sion adjectives, e.g. kwasa s@mi (little+fem.sg long) ‘a little far, long’, n@ma kru (big+fem.sg fat)
‘very fat’ (see example 4.52 and the discussion there).
8. Copula complement is a syntactic function which verbs do not have (they have to be
nominalized to be used this way). All nouns and adjectives can be copula complements; unlike
non-agreeing adjectives, the two agreeing dimension adjectives agree in gender and number
  5  The loss of labialization in the ﬁrst part of the reduplicated word is optional.
  6  Ap-a-ka-ap can be pronounced either as [apa""ka:p] or as [apaka""ap], with a highly unusual sequence of identical
vowels.
   7 We can recall (§3.1) that ‘manner’ can be cross-referenced on the verb in second position, if topical, e.g. akatawa
sa:d suku-k@-tua (thus way write-fut-1sgsubj.vt+3fem.sgbas.vt) ‘I will write (it) this way’. Manner words are feminine
(§5.2.1).
98     4 Word Classeswith the subject; see examples in §4.3.1. The value adjective yara ‘ﬁne’ does not agree with the
subject when used as copula complement.
9. Head of NP is a syntactic function limited to nouns and adjectives. Verbs have to be
nominalized to be used as arguments. The resulting nominalizations are used in a limited range
of functions (see §9.1.1). We can recall, from §4.1, that deverbal nouns can be heads of noun
phrases, but cannot be modiﬁed or possessed. A few verbs can be nominalized with the syllable-
structure-sensitive suﬃx -ka:u, e.g. kak@l- ‘exceed, win’, kak@l-ka:u ‘competition’ (see §9.1.2).
   In contrast, any noun or adjective can be head of an NP, and be used as an argument. Heads
of possessive NPs of the types discussed in §8.1 are mostly nouns.
10. A member of any word class can be modifier in an NP. The structure of NPs (with special
attention to the variable positioning of possessives, quantiﬁers, and modiﬁers from closed
classes) is discussed in §20.1.1. Only rarely can an NP contain two non-agreeing adjectives.
The few available examples involve a dimension adjective and a colour adjective; dimension
precedes colour, as in g@rg@r ñikiñiki ñan (tiny red:red child) ‘tiny pink baby’ (said ironically
to a 3-year-old crying as if she were a baby).
   We saw in §4.3.1 above that the two agreeing dimension adjectives can occur together
(but then the meanings are slightly idiosyncratic). The third agreeing adjective, yara ‘ﬁne’,
hardly ever co-occurs in a noun phrase with any other adjectival modiﬁers. The agreeing
adjectives occur further away from the head of a noun phrase than non-agreeing adjectives;
this is a feature they share with other modiﬁers from closed classes—e.g. demonstratives or
indeﬁnites—which have the same gender and number agreement patterns and marking (see
§5.1 and §§10.2–3).
11. Modification by m@y ‘real; very’ provides an additional criterion for distinguishing
between the three major word classes in Manambu. The non-agreeing adjective m@y ‘real’
occurs preposed to nouns, with the meaning ‘real’, e.g. m@y-a ma:j (real-lk story) ‘real story’.
Like any prehead modiﬁer, it then takes a linker. It occurs postposed to an adjective in the
predicate slot with the meaning of ‘very’, e.g. kwasa m@y (little+fem.sg real) ‘very small, very
little’, vyak@t-a m@y (good-lk very) ‘very good’. When it appears preposed to an adjective
in any function, its meaning is ‘really’, e.g. m@y-a kwasa-di du-ta:kw (real-lk little-pl man-
woman) ‘really small people’, m@y-a n@ma-di k@ p (real-lk big-pl land) ‘really big stretches of
land’, m@y-a vyak@t-a (real-lk good-lk) ‘(something) really good’.
   This same adjective occurs with nouns, in the meaning of ‘real’, e.g. m@y-a du (real-lk man)
‘real man (that is, not a spirit or an animal in disguise)’, m@y-a ta:kw ‘real woman’. In contrast,
a verb can only take the adverb m@yir ‘really’, as in wun m@yir ma: la:kw (I real+all neg
know:neg) ‘I really do not know’ (also see §21.2.4). The meaning ‘very’ with verbs is covered
partly by intensifying reduplication (see §12.8.2), and partly by -yak@- compounds (see §15.3).
   In summary: the two adjective subclasses diﬀer in a number of properties, and yet have
enough properties in common (especially 4–11, and also 1, 9, and 10) to justify being assigned
to one major word class. Agreeing adjectives show similarities to modiﬁers from closed classes
(§4.5), while non-agreeing adjectives—most of which are derived from nouns—are noun-like.","[121, 122, 123, 124, 125]"
"                                     12.1.2 Action focusThe action focus marker -na- indicates that the activity itself rather than any of the participants
is in focus; in clauses which contain the action focus marker there are no participants more
salient or topical than the subject. In fact, other participants are often backgrounded.
   The action focus is often used in clauses describing actions which take place one after
another, as in 12.5 (the forms are underlined). All the actions are happening at the same time
as the speech act itself, with the exception of the last clause where the action is immediately
preceding the time of speech act.

  As mentioned above, traditional stories are usually cast in past tense. However, vivid
accounts of actual events are often cast in the versatile tense, with the action-focus marker
employed to focus the audience’s attention on the event itself.
256      12 Verbal Categories   This is illustrated in 12.7, from a story about how the Avatip men had killed the Japanese
invaders during the Second World War. At the very beginning, the speaker establishes the past
time frame. As soon as he starts talking about the action itself, he switches to versatile tense
(ﬁrst line of 12.7).
   This was followed by a sequence of actions which describe the attack, each marked with
action focus. The sequence was interrupted once (lines 6–7), by the speaker bringing the
audience back to the time frame of the narrative, and saying: ‘this was the time when we the
fathers were also young’. Here, the verb form is in bold. It is also in highlighting focus, and this
is why it is marked with an additional set of nominal enclitics. (The feminine cross-referencing
here refers to the time of event: ‘time’ in Manambu is inherently feminine.) After this insertion,
the speaker goes back to his lively narration using action-focused terms:

     All right’
   Taken out of context, a form marked with action focus can have a wide range of temporal
references, from present to recent past to near future, just like any versatile tense. So, a form
r @-na-wun (sit-act.foc-1sgbas.vt) may mean ‘I am sitting down’, or ‘I have just sat down’, or
‘I am about to sit down’. Action focus does not make the verb intransitive and is thus not a
valency-changing device: as shown in examples 3.2 and 12.8, a verb marked with action focus
can take an object. Example 12.8 describes the event which triggers the developments in the
rest of this story:
12.8 [a-d@               d@-k@-d@          last ñan] ada                   ta:kw

unmarked for case. Such objects have either a generic reference, or their full involvement in the
activity is irrelevant, as in 3.2, 7.4, and 12.8. This agrees with the general meaning of the action
focus.
   The action focus marker occurs with versatile tense cross-referencing markers. We can recall,
from Scheme 11.2 and §3.1, that it can only occur with basic A/S cross-referencing. It is thus
mutually exclusive with a non-subject constituent more topical than the subject. This follows
from the meaning of action focus: the action itself is more important than the participants, and
the topicality of participants is not an issue. Action focus is incompatible with the highlighting
focus marking (see §20.3).
                                         12.2 f ut ur eThe future in Manambu is marked with the suﬃx -k@-, followed by versatile tense cross-
referencing markers. The future marker can occur with the action focus marker provided
the action—rather than the participants—is focused on. Past markers do not occur with the
future. The future marker may be etymologically connected with the same-subject purposive
-k, diﬀerent-subject purposive -k@k, or the dative-aversive case -Vk (see §7.4, §13.4).
   The future form usually refers to an action or state subsequent to the speech act, as in 12.9.
Here, the object (‘key’) is the topic of a stretch of a story about how the hen and the hawk do
not get along because of a key the hen had lost. The key is masculine because it is long and
thin, and the house is feminine, because it is small.12.9 k@                  wiya-k@-d@                 ki ada

     ‘I will give you that (topical) key of this house’  In 12.10, the action focus marker is used, since the important point is what the participants
are going to do:12.10 an     kwa-k@-na-bran,               s@kul@k yi-ku,          a    m@n-a-p@k

      ‘We two will stay, having cooked, then, like you, we will come the day after tomorrow’  As shown in §2.4.2, light monosyllabic verb roots have an option of marking future with the
reduplicated -k@-k@- (Table 2.4). The existence of two allomorphs depending on the syllable
weight of the verb root was discussed in §2.4.2. An example is at 12.11.12.11 na:gw sau-n yi-k@-k@-bana

      ‘We will go straight away after having fried sago’   However, the marker -k@- can occasionally occur with a light verb root. The two options are
in free variation, as shown in 12.12.

      ‘I will tell another story straight away. So it is (life story) I will tell, I will tell (it)’
The reduplicated -k@- is never used with the verb k@- ‘consume (eat, drink, smoke)’: so, a form
like ∗ k@-k@-k@-bana (eat-fut-fut-1plsubj.vt+3fem.sgbas.vt) is ungrammatical, and k@-k@-bana
would always be used instead in the meaning of ‘we will eat (it)’. This may also be due to a rule
of loss of a voiceless velar stop discussed at A3 in §2.6.
   The future is homophonous with irrealis (§13.3). In positive clauses, the two meanings are
distinguished solely by context. But, as we will see in §13.3, the future and the epistemic, or
irrealis, meanings are formally distinguished under negation: ku-sada ma: means ‘she won’t
put’, and ak@s ku-sada-k-la means ‘she might not have put; she would not have put’ (§14.1.1
and §14.3.1). This suggests that synchronically there are two morphemes -k@-: one is marking
future, and the other one marking irrealis (§13.3).
   An example of an irrealis form is at 12.13. This was said as an explanation for why the little
girl woke up in tears. A future interpretation would not make sense here.

      ‘She must have seen a (bad) dream’; ∗ ‘She will see a bad dream’
   A future and an irrealis in a main clause can be ambiguous: for instance, 12.14 can mean
‘she will put (the purse) inside the bag’, or ‘she might have put (the purse) inside the bag’:
12.14 b@gam           ku-sada-k-la

      (a) ‘She will put (the purse) inside the bag’
      (b) ‘She might have put (the purse) inside the bag’
  The overtones of future and irrealis in juxtaposed clauses are discussed in §19.1.
                                     12.3 ha b i t ua l a s p e c tThe habitual aspect is the only aspect which consistently combines with a fully inﬂected
verb. It can co-occur only with the versatile tense cross-referencing, and has the following
properties:
   r It has two forms: non-past tense marked with the suﬃx -kwa, and past marked with -yi-
     kwa-. The semantic distinction is that of non-past versus past—this is in contrast to the
     diﬀerence between the past tense and ‘versatile’ tense in non-habitual clauses which covers
     recent past, recent future, and present, and is also used in vivid narratives.
   r The non-past habitual can occur with the action focus marker, as shown in 12.17.
   r The habitual is negated with the particle ak@s which, unlike the non-habitual declarative
     negator, occurs with a fully inﬂected verb. The same categories can be expressed in positive
     and in negative habitual clauses. In contrast, negative declarative non-habitual clauses
                                                                    12.3 Habitual aspect        259     require the negator ma: accompanied by a non-inﬂected form of the verb with no person,
     gender, or number distinctions (§§14.1–2).
   r The habitual aspect does not combine with future: a future habitual meaning can only be
     expressed with a complex predicate involving the verb kwa- ‘stay’ (12.20–1).
   The habitual marker could be etymologically related to the polyfunctional verb kwa- ‘stay’
(see §17.1.1 on its use as auxiliary in aspectual complex predicates with the meaning of
prolonged durative). Synchronically, however, the habitual diﬀers from verb compounding
structures since (i) it is negated in a unique way, (ii) its past form involves an additional marker
-yi-, and (iii) it only takes the versatile tense cross-referencing markers.
   The past habitual marker could be related to the verb yi- ‘go’ or the copula verb yi- (the two
are distinguished in the ways they form imperative: see §4.2.2), or to neither of these.
   Unlike the verb kwa-, the habitual does not form an imperative, or combine with any further
modality speciﬁcations. The irregular negative habitual form of the verb ‘give’ was illustrated
in 4.38 (also see 4.37, for a regular one).
   The habitual aspect describes usual activities, as in 12.15. The versatile tense form refers to
activities not restricted to any time frame, and is frequent in generic statements, with or without
the action focus marker:
12.15 mi:ya-b@r        yap-@-m        ji-ku         ñan-ugw ata
      log+lk-3dunom rope-lk-loc tie-compl.ss child-pl then

      play-hab-act.foc-3plbas.vt swings+lk+loc
      ‘Having tied two logs on the rope, children play on the swings’
  Along similar lines, 12.16 states what the snake used to do. Fish are the topic, and this is why
they have to be cross-referenced on the verb:
12.16 kami: d@ k@-kwa-da-di
      ﬁsh he eat-hab-3masc.sgsubj.p-3plbas.p
      ‘He (the snake) used to eat ﬁsh’
  In a vivid narrative about her experience living with an Australian couple, the speaker used
the non-past habitual marked with action focus, so as to highlight what her foster parents used
to do:
12.17 Harold, d@ kamna:gw-a:b k@-j@b@r t@-kwa-na-d                             a-di

      to eat things like fruit, together with his wife Kay. They then treated me correctly, like
      (their) child’
The past habitual refers to usual activities restricted to the time before the speech act, which
are no longer relevant for the present. The usual activities described in 12.18 ended just after
Australians occupied the Sepik area:
260     12 Verbal Categories12.18 aw kr@l                      da-yi-kwa-di

      ‘They then used to go down the river here’   In 12.19 the past habitual—used in a relative clause—refers to something that is no longer
there (we will see in §14.5 and §19.2 that relative clauses have all the speciﬁcations of a main
clause, unless negated; in cases like this one they can be distinguished from juxtaposed main
clauses by intonation only).12.19 ata [kwa-yi-kwa-da-di                       kara:b]

      ‘Those (reactivated topic) men’s houses in which they used to stay were like this. Now
      they are no longer there’  A negated form of the habitual aspect is illustrated in 7.16 (also see §14.2). A future habitual
meaning can be expressed by a complex predicate consisting of the lexical verb marked with
the sequencing manner suﬃx -n and the verb kwa- ‘stay’ marked for future, as in 12.20. Such
examples may have an additional connotation of ‘staying in a place’ (rather than moving), due
to the primary meaning of the verb ‘stay’.12.20 ñ@n         a-k@s,    wun [kur@n             kwa-k@-tua]
      you.fem.sg impv-get I        take.care+seq stay-fut-1sgsubj.vt+3fem.sgbas.vt
      ‘You get (shrimp), I will keep taking care (of the baby)’ or
      ‘You get (shrimp), I will stay taking care (of the baby) (rather than move)’   If the context excludes the connotation of ‘staying in a place’, the reading of such construc-
tions is habitual. In 12.21, the sorceress is expected to keep going back and lighting a ﬁre. There
is no connotation of ‘staying’—the verb kwa- has a purely habitual meaning.12.21 yi [taka-n kwa-k@-na]
      ﬁre put-seq stay-fut-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt
      ‘She will keep lighting a ﬁre’   The habitual marker can occur with the root kwa- ‘stay’ in one grammatical word,
e.g. walim@udi waku-n kwa-kwa-da s@k@r (rainbow go.out-seq stay-hab-3masc.sgsubj.vt+
3fem.sgbas.vt time) ‘the time when the rainbow usually stays having come out’. Without a
future marker, the verb kwa- in combination with a verb marked with a sequencing -n describes
a sequence of actions—see §18.2.
   Etymologically, the habitual could well be related to the Wosera -kwa ‘vivid present’ (Wilson
1980: 68). No other Ndu language appears to use a habitual aspect marker of this shape.
                         12.4 c o m p l e t e i n vo lv e m e n t o f s / oThe suﬃx -tu- ‘all’ indicates complete involvement of S or O. That an aﬃx referring to plurality
or complete coverage of participants operates on an absolutive basis is not uncommon cross-
linguistically (Dixon 1994: 55). This suﬃx does not occur together with the habitual.
                                                              12.5 Conﬁrmation marker          261  In 12.22 and 12.72, the suﬃx marks complete involvement of numerous S.

      væk@r-tu-na-di
      fall-many-act.foc-3plbas.vt
      ‘Those tiny ants, black ants, centipedes all fell (into the ﬁre)’
  In 12.23, -tu- indicates that all the O were involved:
12.23 na:gw vya-wuta-tu-l@-di
      sago hit-break.in.two-many-3fem.sgsubj.p-3plbas.p
      ‘She broke all the (branches) of sago palm’
  The suﬃx -tu- refers to S of an ambitransitive verb, thus showing that it is used intransitively,
as in 12.24. We can recall, from §7.2, that gu in examples like 12.24 is part of a complex
ambitransitive verb and not its object. Not surprisingly, -tu- in 12.24 refers to people who
washed themselves fully, and not to the water:
12.24 gu    ata yaku-tu-di
      water then wash-many-3plbas.vt/p
      ‘Then they washed (fully)’
   The suﬃx -tu- is often used with verbs of aﬀect. It is likely to be cognate to the Wosera suﬃx
-to- ‘all’ (Wilson 1980: 63).
                              12.5 c o n f i r m at i o n m a r k e rThe conﬁrmation marker -@k stresses that the action or state has taken place or is happening.
This marker occupies the very last place within an inﬂected verb (see Scheme 11.2) and occurs
on verbs, and on non-verbal predicates (see Scheme 11.3), provided these have a ﬁrst or second
person subject (as in 12.25–7), or ﬁrst or second person object (as in T3.8). That is, this suﬃx
can only be used with speech act participants. In 12.25, the conﬁrmation marker goes onto a
nominal head of predicate and onto the verb in a following clause.
12.25 [takw-a-ñ@n-@k ]              [wiya:m          r@-na-ñ@n-@k ]
      woman-lk-2fem.sgnom-conf house+lk+loc stay-act.foc-2fem.sgbas.vt-conf
      ‘You are indeed a woman, (this is why) you are indeed staying at home’
  When we arrived at Yuanab and asked an old lady whether she had been to church yet, she
answered:
12.26 b@ta:y-@k
      already-conf
      ‘Already indeed! (that is, I have already!)’
  In 12.5 (‘I have come’), the conﬁrmation marker co-occurs with the action focus, and in
10.60 it occurs on a verb marked with habitual aspect.
  The conﬁrmation marker can occur with future, provided the point in time is deﬁned, as in
T3.7 and T3.40 (‘today you will die’). The conﬁrmation marker occurs in rhetorical questions,
as in 12.27, but not in information questions:
262      12 Verbal Categories12.27 ñ@n        ata ata kur-ñ@n-@k?
      you.fem.sg how how do-2fem.sgbas.vt-conf
      ‘What (on earth) have you done!’
  The conﬁrmation marker is not compatible with negation.
                                 12.6 c o m p l e t i v e a s p e c tCompletive aspect is marked with the suﬃx -Vm, the same as the locative case (see the
discussion at §7.11). Its meaning conveys completion of an action or total achievement of a
state. As was shown in §7.11, this marker can attach to a verbal root, as in 7.85, 12.7 (second
line), and 12.28.
12.28 a-d@                 t@p    ada                     b@

      kus@-pakw@m
      ﬁnish-everything+compl
      ‘In this village everything was completely over’
  This same marker occurs on adjectives in the predicate slot, as in 12.29:
12.29 kuprap-@-m
      bad-lk-compl
      ‘It is irredeemably bad’
   To be used in dependent clauses or to take further person or modality expressions, the
completive form requires the support verb na- ‘copula for abstract states’. This is in contrast to
other uninﬂected verbs, which are used with the functionally unmarked support verb t@- ‘be,
stand’. The support verb occurs in main clauses if the tense and person, number and gender
speciﬁcations are required:
12.30 sa:l     yi: ma:, kwasa-kwasa                   ja:p r@p@m

      na-d@m@n
      be:nat-2masc.sgbas.vt
      ‘You won’t be short (of anything), you are ﬁne as far as small things are concerned’
  The support verb is obligatory in subordinate clauses—see the second clause in 12.31. In the
ﬁrst clause of 12.31 the copula is omitted, since this is a main clause, and no extra speciﬁcations
are required: they are clear from the context.

      kind of earth away?” ’   Some nominal-like forms containing formative -Vm which cannot be omitted occur as
complements of the copula na- ‘be: natural phenomena or abstract state’. These could be
instances of fossilized completive, e.g. katelam na- ‘be light (of daylight)’, karyam na- ‘be almost
light’ (of daylight), tugwam na- ‘be clear, have clear vision’.
   The completive aspect cannot be used in commands; nor is there any form which can be
used instead. One reason for this gap is semantic: it focuses on the full completion of the
action, and commands in Manambu do not convey such meanings. The other reason is formal:
the completive aspect is an uninﬂected verb used as copula complement of the ‘abstract state’
copula na-. This copula does not have an imperative, and hardly ever occurs in commands of
any sort.
                                 12.7 c u s t o m a ry a s p e c tThe customary aspect is marked with the suﬃx -j@b@r , and means ‘usually, always or contin-
uously do’. It can head the predicate of an independent clause without a copula, if person,
number, gender, or additional aspect meanings do not have to be speciﬁed, as in 12.32 and
6.39.12.32 d@        m@r@wa          wa:l ada                        ja-j@b@r

      ‘Rain with wind was falling customarily and continuously’In 12.17, ‘he always used to eat’, the customary form appears in the copula complement slot.
As expected, the copula, t@-, carries all the grammatical markers. A similar example is at 12.33.12.33 l@ tapwuk wuka                                   kaw r@pa-j@b@r

      be-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt
      ‘The hen is always scraping a hole (in the ground, looking for a key she’d lost)’  Unlike the habitual and the completive aspects, the customary aspect can occur in negative
and prohibitive constructions. In all such cases it has to occur with the copula t@-.12.34 yaki k@-j@b@r t@-tukwa

      dem.dist-masc.sg drum get-cust go.up-3masc.sgbas.vt/p
      ‘He went up always clinging (lit. getting) to the drum’If a verb carrying the marker of the customary aspect heads the predicate of a dependent clause,
the copula t@- is used—this is a typical property of an uninﬂected verb:
264       12 Verbal Categories12.36 [d@ ata k@tay          v@-j@b@r t@-ta:y]     ka:gw ata

      ‘Then he, keeping looking around, sounded the drum’
  However, unlike any other uninﬂected verb, verbs marked with customary aspect oﬀer an
option of taking a medial clause marker directly. Examples 12.37–8 illustrate a number of
medial clause markers used this way:
12.37 v@-j@b@r-ta:y     laku-k@-tua-di
      see-cust-cotemp understand-fut-1sgsubj.vt-3plbas.vt
      ‘Having seen (these words) all the time, I will understand them’

      eat-hab-act.foc-3plbas.vt/p
      ‘After her having always ﬁnished the job (building the house), they eat food later’
  Examples like 12.37–8 are characteristic of speakers of all generations. It is unlikely that they
are a recent innovation. In male songs about foiled marriages, verbal forms marked with -j@b@r
function as fully inﬂected verbs, taking person, number, and gender marking. Example 12.39
comes from Harrison (1983: 62).
12.39 Magad@mi r@-j@brad                      p@taka:u
      (name)      sit-always+3masc.sgbas.vt/p ladder
      ‘The ladder Magad@mi is there’
  Such examples are not found in everyday speech. We can hypothesize that, in the past, verbs
with the marker -j@b@r could have been fully inﬂected, similarly to the compound verbs with
aspectual meanings discussed in §15.3.

        ‘At night she having gone straight on the road ﬁrst entered the house’
The temporal noun ga:n in the ﬁrst clause is unmarked for case (as expected: §7.2). An unusually long
vowel in the sequential form yi::n iconically reﬂects the distance travelled. In the last clause the oblique
appears after the verb—see §20.2.

        ‘Having gone to another house, she sat on the big post listening to what was above’
An unusually long vowel in the sequential form yi::n iconically reﬂects the distance. The directional form
of the verb ‘hear’ is used adverbially, just as in 16.59 (see the discussion there).

        ‘She sat listening for that name, thinking (lit. having said), “They will call the name of Oselo” ’
The argument of the verb ‘listen’, a noun phrase ‘for that name’ is split oﬀ from the verb by a completive
medial clause expressing internal speech or thinking of the snake (with the verb of speech: see §19.5.6).

The directional form of the verb ‘hear’ is used adverbially, just as in 16.59 (see the discussion there) and
in T3.27.

        ‘She sat listening in the upward direction (that time), she sat and sat and sat and sat, (they) did

The ﬁrst clause contains a sequencing form of the verb ‘listen’ accompanied by a directional (in contrast
to an adverbial use of the same form in T3.27, and T3.30). Time is cross-referenced in the second position
of the predicate of the second clause. The next clause contains a durative frustrative (§13.6).

        ‘She went that time, but his smell too was very diﬃcult to smell’
Time is cross-referenced in the second position of the predicate of the ﬁrst clause. The next clause is linked
to the preceding one with the connective aw (see §19.6) which has a contrastive meaning. The last clause
contains a nominalization (wuk@wuk ‘smelling’) as a complementation strategy with the verb ‘be diﬃcult’.
  T3.34 [ [a:bab-a du ta:kw] d@y-a-k@                   ya:m] [d@-k@-wa ras@gwa-d@-l@k]

        ‘Since the smell of all the people mixed up with him, there was no possibility of smelling (it)’
The ﬁrst clause is a causal clause (see §18.7). It contains a complex possessive noun phrase (see §20.1.1).
The second clause contains a negated nominalization (§14.3.3) in the meaning of ‘absolute’ negation.
  T3.35 [ya-n]    [wuk@wuk suan        yi-l@-k]               [aka                          k@p

        ‘Having come, as it was diﬃcult to smell, having gone just like that she went to a third house’
The second clause cross-references third person which could well be the mother snake. However, the
predicate of this clause is cross-referenced for diﬀerent subject; and the snake is the main character and
the subject of this whole sentence. This indicates that the second clause contains a ‘body part construction’
or that the nominalization is in the S function (see §17.4 and §20.1.4). In the next clause, k@ p ‘just’ has an
overtone of ‘for nothing’—see Chapter 21 on its other meanings. The form mugul-a-wi could also mean
‘three houses’ (see §20.1.1); here it means ‘number three house’.

        ‘She went (that time) to a third house’
The constituent in brackets in the ﬁrst clause is a noun phrase with two modiﬁers (see §20.1.1). The
reactivated topic demonstrative referring to time (cross-referenced in the second position on the verb) is
postposed to the verb—see §20.2.

        ‘As she sat, as she sat, as she sat, on and on, the night had completely fallen, she having said,
        “Oh, no (or nothing)”, went to another house’
The three occurrences of r@-l@-k are pronounced as one intonation unit (without a break). The repetition
iconically reﬂects the length of the action. The next clause consists of yi:n, literally, ‘going’, used adver-
bially in the meaning ‘on and on’ (see §18.2), and lengthened to reﬂect the amount of time the snake
spent sitting. The speech report consists of just an interjection and a negative pro-clause which can be
translated as ‘no’ or as ‘nothing’.

The ﬁrst word in the ﬁrst clause of the speech report is in a vocative form (marked by lengthening the
vowel of the last syllable: §2.1.3). In the next clause, a very dark night is referred to as a big-masculine
night: see §5.2.1. The next clause contains an inclusory construction (‘we with children’ meaning ‘children
and I’). The dative-aversive nominalization in this clause refers to an intention—see §13.7. The next speech
report is by the snake. It starts with the interjection mm (see §2.1.3)—a marker of ‘warning’, indicating
that the speaker is up to no good. The constituent in brackets is a lengthy noun phrase—see §20.1.1.
The next clause contains a threat which sounds almost like a prediction, due to the conﬁrmation marker:
‘today you will die’. The use of substitutive case as a clause-linking device was discussed in §19.3. And see
§20.4.2, for the functions of ya:kya clauses.

and this constituent shows that this is an afterthought (see §20.2). The second clause contains a vocative
form of the ﬁnal verb (§2.1.3). The dependent medial clause following the clause with the verb of speech

The ﬁrst clause is a juxtaposed clause with a temporal meaning—see §19.1. Constituents in brackets in
the third clause are appositional noun phrases—see §20.1.1. The next clause contains a headless relative
clause with comitative marking on it (see §19.2.1). Clause 11 contains the generic verb m@gi- ‘do whatever’
used as a cover term for a variety of possible verbs of hitting and killing (see §21.3.2). The next two clauses
are juxtaposed to this clause, providing further speciﬁcation of the action. In the last clause of the speech
report the oblique ‘with a white man’s knife’ follows the verb (see §20.2).

speech report; note that the speech verb wa- intervenes between clausal constituents. The ﬁrst clause after

The last clause consists just of ya:k—see §20.4.2 on the function of ya:k(ya) clauses.

        ‘Having eaten food, after children (and) wife went inside (their mosquito nets) to sleep, Oselo,
        he too, went inside’
The ﬁrst clause contains the generic completive verb napa- (see §18.9) denoting that the process of
eating food was completed. The ﬁrst word in this clause, kamna:, is a variant of kamna:gw (see A3
in §2.6). The second clause has a complex structure: it consists of a matrix clause and a desiderative
clause indicating the intention (‘to sleep’). A desiderative rather than same-subject purposive is used here

wula- in this context means ‘go inside the mosquito net’.

In her speech introduced by the verb wa-, the mother snake makes a prediction which sounds like a threat.
The verb of speech is used twice, as is typical for a speech report framing construction (see §19.5.1). Time
is cross-referenced on the predicate of the next clause. The sequencing medial clause is postposed to it
(see §20.2). The prolonged ﬁnal vowel iconically reﬂects slow and lengthy movement by the snake.

The constituent in brackets in the third clause is a complex predicate with anterior meaning—see §17.1.1.
In the last clause, the form miyawa (which contains a comitative marker -wa in its derivational meaning:

The second clause contains a negated nominalization in its predicate slot. The fourth clause contains a

The predicate of the second clause cross-references the object (snake) in the second position; the object

compatible with non-word class-changing suﬃxes, such as -aba:b ‘too’ (see §9.2)).

        ‘Here the story is ﬁnished’
This last clause of the story contains a typical ending: when a story ﬁnishes it is understood as ‘going back
to where it came from’. Note a slight diﬀerence in the form of the verb and constituent order (whereby
the reactivated topic demonstrative is postposed to the verb: see §20.2) between this ending and T2.69:
here the speaker had felt that his story had gone on for too long, and in this sentence the fact of its ﬁnally
coming to an end is in the sentence-ﬁnal position marking its ‘unexpectedness’ (see §20.2). Not so in
T2.69 which was a traditional story and, according to the speaker, ﬁnished in due course.
           VocabularyOnly words occurring in the examples and texts above are listed here. Each root is speciﬁed for its word
class, and transitivity (in the case of verbs). Roots which require suﬃxes (that is, verbs) have a hyphen (-)
at the end. Verb roots are given in their positive declarative root form (e.g. wuk@- ‘hear, listen’ or wa- ‘say,
speak’). For nominal components of complex verbs, we include the support verb used (in brackets). A
morphologically complex word is divided into morphemes. Diﬀerent meanings of homophonous lexemes
are separated with a semicolon (;), as in kap@- ‘cut grass; wait’. Diﬀerent meanings of polysemous lexemes
are separated with a comma, as in ñan ‘child, youngster (in terms of age and status group), child of
someone (n)’. The following abbreviations are used:
adj        adjective
adv        adverb (including time words)
conn       connective
cp         complex predicate
interj     interjection
n          noun
ncv        nominal component of complex verbs
part       particle
q          quantiﬁer
vitr       intransitive verb
vp         polyfunctional verb (which can function as a support, auxiliary, and copula verb)
vtr        transitive and ambitransitive verb
I have not included here grammatical markers and members of closed classes discussed elsewhere in
the grammar, such as pronouns or postpositions. Neither have productive or semi-productive derivations
(such as nominalizations or causatives) been included. Aﬃxes are included in the list of aﬃxes. Loanwords
and code-switches in Tok Pisin and English have not been included. A list of kinship terms is in Table 6.1.
   Entries are translated with one or two English words that give some indication of the most central
meaning of the Manambu word. A fuller statement of the meanings of the Manambu lexicon will be in
the dictionary of Manambu (currently in preparation, by Pauline Laki and Aikhenvald). All the entries
are in the Avatip variety, unless the Malu variety is explicitly indicated.","[684, 685, 686, 687, 688, 689, 690, 691, 692]"
"                                12.8.3 Repetition of the verbRepetition of an inﬂected verb features prominently in expressing intensity and repetition of
actions and states. We identify the following conventionalized techniques.
A. Repetition of a sequential form of the verb marked with the suffix -n indicates
a repeated action done little by little and simultaneous with that of the main verb, as in
12.74–5. The verb is repeated twice. If a root is monosyllabic, it does not undergo lengthening
as is normally the case when the suﬃx -n attaches to it (as in 12.80 below). The two instances of
repeated forms are often pronounced as one phonological word: k@nk@n is pronounced as /k@n
g@n/ undergoing an ad hoc voicing assimilation (under the inﬂuence of the preceding nasal).
A usual sequential form of k@ ‘eat’ is ka:n ‘eating’, with vowel lengthening (see similar forms
under (C) below).
   Just before we went oﬀ to Swakap, embarking on a long and exhausting journey, Yuaya:b
brought us a few sticks of sugarcane to keep us going and said:
12.74 k@n      k@n      k@-gura-di
      eat+seq eat+seq eat-2plsubj.vt-3plbas.vt
      ‘You are going to keep eating (these) little by little’
  Similarly, in 12.75 the narrator refers to the fact that the two people had just brought the
ladder made of rope up into the house by tying it up bit by bit:
12.75 waya:b k@-d@                  p@taka:u ji-n     ji-n
      recently dem.prox-masc.sg ladder        tie-seq tie-seq
      kawar-bra-d
      carry+up-2dusubj.vt-3masc.sgbas.vt
      ‘Just recently you two carried this ladder up by tying it repeatedly bit by bit’
  A similar example is in 14.113 (‘eating and eating and eating’).
B. Repetition of inflected compound verb in combination with different directionals is
a way of expressing a sequence of movements in diﬀerent directions. Operating a pump torch
involves pressing it ‘in and out’, and this was described as 12.76:
12.76 kay-b@tuku-s@w@lan        kay-b@tuku-saku-n
      manip-pump-inside+seq manip-pump-outwards-seq
      kay-b@tuku-tua-d
      manip-pump-1sgsubj.vt-3masc.sgbas.vt
      ‘I pump it pumping it in pumping it out’
C. Repetition of a verbal form in a sequential construction with the same verb in the
main clause indicates gradual achievement of the verb’s action or state, as in 12.80–1. The
274     12 Verbal Categoriesclosest analogy is English ‘going, going . . . gone’. The reactivated topic demonstrative refers to
the action as a whole, and can appear either before the main clause, or after it. The whole
is pronounced as one intonation unit—which shows that it can no longer be analysed as
multiclausal:
12.77 kus@-n      kus@-n      kus@-l@-l                         aka
      ﬁnish-seq ﬁnish-seq ﬁnish-3fem.sgsubj.p-3fem.sgbas.p dem.dist.react.top+fem.sg
      ‘It (the story) is slowly coming to an end and is now ﬁnished’
12.78 t@p@-taka-n               t@p@-taka-n               aka
      be.closed-put.down-seq be.closed-put.down-seq dem.dist.react.top+fem.sg
      t@p@-taka-tua
      be.closed-put.down-1sgsubj.vt+3fem.sgbas.vt
      ‘I am slowly closing (the door) and have closed it’D. Repetition of a verbal form in a sequential construction with a copula verb in the
main clause marks an action that continually goes on and on, as in 12.79.
12.79 t@pa:m          kwa-na-di               du akatawa titiya-n           titiya-n

      t@-kwa-na-di
      stay-hab-act.foc-3plbas.vt
      ‘Men who are in the village go round and round like this’
The instances of repetition discussed under A–D above can be considered at least partially
grammaticalized, since their meaning is somewhat idiosyncratic.
  Besides this, any inﬂected verb, within a main or a subordinate clause, can be repeated more
than twice in a fully iconic meaning. The verb is typically repeated two, three, ﬁve, seven, or ten
times (but hardly any other number of times), depending on the length of time of the action
the speaker is trying to express. In 12.80, the form ta:n ‘by staying’ is repeated three times, to
indicate a considerable length of time:
12.80 ka-war-tu-k@b                atawatay ta:n        ta:n       ta:n     ya:kya
      carry-up-1sg-compl.ds+term thus         stay+seq stay+seq stay+seq OK
      ‘As soon as I brought (my family) up there, having stayed (for some time), OK (I then
      left)’
  In 12.81, this same form ta:n ‘by staying’ is repeated seven times—indicating that the
ceremony went on for a very long time. The repeated forms belong to diﬀerent intonation
units.
12.81 waku-ku,         ba:gw     adiya                   t@-na-di                  ta:n

      then stay-3plbas.vt/p
      ‘Having gone out, they held a ceremony, after they held it (for a very long time), they
      went to sleep’
                                     12.8 Intensive, continuous, and repeated actions   275  A complement of a support verb (see Chapter 17) can also be repeated, but no more than
three times, as in 12.82, 9.14, and T2.25 (fourth line: ‘eyes bulging out’).
12.82 t@m@l           t@m@l             t@m@l          ata na:l
      roll/make.noise roll/make.noise roll/make.noise then be:nat+3fem.sgbas.p
      ‘There was a noise of (him) rolling and rolling’
  Tok Pisin shares the principle of repetition as a marker of intensive and prolonged action
and state with Manambu. The inﬂuence of Tok Pisin may have contributed to the productivity
of this phenomenon in Manambu (which could well reﬂect an areal feature).
         13         Mood and Modality
                                         13.1 ov e rv i ewOf all the modal forms discussed here, only irrealis is fully inﬂected. Imperative is partially
inﬂected, employing a special set of subject markers. Diﬀerent-subject purposive is partially
inﬂected with the non-tensed subject markers listed in Table 11.2. All other modalities are
uninﬂected. A summary is at §13.8. None of the modal forms is compatible with the verbal
categories discussed in Chapter 12.
                                       13.2 i m p e rat i v eThe imperative is the main means of marking directive speech acts, including orders and
requests. The subject of the imperative is marked with aﬃxes listed in Table 13.1. The resulting
forms are partially inﬂected. Second person imperative is unusual in that it does not distinguish
number or gender. As we will see in 13.3–5 below, number and gender meanings can be dis-
ambiguated through personal pronouns. First person imperative distinguishes three numbers,
but no genders; and third person imperative distinguishes two genders in the singular and no
genders in dual or plural, just as expected.
  The imperative paradigm is formally heterogeneous. The formal aspects of second, ﬁrst,
and third person imperative are discussed in §13.2.1, and their semantics in §13.2.2. Optative
modality formed on imperative is featured in §13.2.3.","[300, 301, 302, 303]"

ﬁght the moon but cannot ﬁnd her. Ak@- can be extended to have a temporal sense: ak@ s@k@r
(where.fem.sg time) is the only way of saying ‘when’, as in 10.89.
10.89 ak@          s@k@r ap    yi-b@r?
      where.fem.sg time bone go/get-3dubas.vt
      ‘When did they two grow up’ (lit. ‘get bone’)
   In 10.90, the masculine singular interrogative ak@-d@ is used to refer to a bamboo, in an
elliptical sentence. The bamboo is masculine because it is long:
10.90 wun asa:y a-d-a-wur                kañ@k              wa-na-d
      I    father dem.dist-masc.sg-lk-up bamboo+lk+dat say-act.foc-3masc.sgbas.vt
      ak@-d@         ka:ñ?
      where-masc.sg bamboo
      ‘My father told me about that bamboo up (i.e. told me to fetch it). Bamboo which is
      where?’
  In 10.91, this interrogative refers to a possessor (here, a locality). This is the preferred way
of asking where a person is from:
10.91 ak@            tami-k@-l        ta:kw-a?
      where.fem.sg area-poss-fem.sg woman-3fem.sgnom
      ‘What (lit. where) area’s woman (is she)?’
   The form ak@- can take one transportative case, -say, as in 7.64. If the question focuses on
the location, and not on the participant in a location, the locative or the terminative case form
is used, as in 10.92:
10.92 a-di        kway ak@m             kur-ñ@na-di
      dem.dist-pl shrimp where+loc get-2fem.sgsubj.vt-3plbas.vt
      ‘Where did you get those shrimp?’
  Either terminative or locative case can be used in asking about the source, as in 7.29, 7.55,
and 10.93:
10.93 oh, vyak@t-a ta:kw, [ak@m          t@-l@-k]
      oh good-lk woman where+loc be/stand-3fem.sg-compl.ds
      karya-m@na
      bring-2masc.sgsubj.vt+3fem.sgbas.vt
      ‘Oh, (what) a beautiful woman, where did you bring her from?’ (lit. ‘while she was staying
      where, did you bring her from?’)
When focused, ak@- behaves similarly to reactivated topic demonstratives used as predicate
heads: the ak@- form takes a linking marker followed by -aka (glossed here as focus marker).
Unlike reactivated topic demonstratives, the marker is -m- (not n) for all forms, except ak@m
(where+loc) which does not take any marker (cf. -n- in aka-n-aka in 10.70). Focused forms
of interrogatives—unlike those for reactivated topic demonstratives—are not used as predicate
heads. Forms marked with the transportative -say and with the terminative -Vb do not occur
in the focus position at all.
   As is always the case with focused constituents, focused locative interrogatives appear clause-
initially. In 10.94, a masculine singular form of ak@- is a modiﬁer in contrastive focus. As is
typical for a focused element, it is in the clause-initial position. The implication of the rhetorical
question in 10.94 is that there is no territory belonging to the cassowary’s son.

      ‘This is the territory of the bad legendary son of cassowary who is from where (lit.
      ‘where-being-focused’)?’
  The focused forms of ak@- can take additional case markers: locative, as in 10.95, and allative,
as in 10.96. Then they take a ‘linker’ n.

      where-foc.m-lk+all go-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt
      ‘Where exactly did she go to?’
(iv) The interrogative akr@l ‘where to’ is used to ask about the direction of motion, as in 10.97.
Note that the questioned direction is part of a medial clause: a questioned constituent can be
in the main clause, or in a medial completive clause.
10.97 oh, [wun-a-b@r rawa-viti                     abra                   b@     akr@l

      go-3du-compl.ds hit-3plsubj.p-3dubas.p
      ‘Oh, they killed my two nephews after they had already gone where?’
   Given that akr@l ‘where to’, discussed below, cannot occupy a focus position, the focused
interrogative ak@m-aka-n@r (where-foc.m-lk+all) ‘exactly where to?’ can be considered its
suppletive focus form. The etymology of akr@l is not fully clear. This form appears to contain
the root ak@- ‘locative interrogative’ followed by -Vr which could be the allative marker; the
ﬁnal -l could well be another instance of the allative marker which has undergone rhotic
dissimilation (A1 under §2.6). A similar allative form has been occasionally heard for the
proximate demonstrative kr@l (dem.prox+fem.sg+all) ‘to here’ (see 12.18).
(v) The interrogative agula ‘what’s up; what for; why’ is used to enquire about someone in
general, and often has negative overtones. When a mentally deranged woman came into our
house and sat down, no one was pleased to see her. The mistress of the house asked her, in an
annoyed tone of voice:
10.98 ñ@n      agula?
      you.fem what’s.up/why
      ‘What are you about? Why are you here?’
  Similarly, a man was behaving in a peculiar way trying to hide from what he thought was an
evil spirit; his wife came in and said: m@n agula? (you.masc what’s.up/why) ‘what’s happening?
what’s wrong with you?’ This same form is used to question the reason of something unpleas-
ant, or unusual. Another example is under 10.99. This was said to a child who was crying out
of spite, and not because anyone did anything to her:
                                                                       10.4 Interrogatives       22910.99 agula         gra-na-ñ@n?
      what’s.up/why cry-act.foc-2fem.sgbas.vt
      ‘Why on earth are you crying?’
  The etymology and the structure of agula is obscure. It probably contains the root agwa-
‘what, which’ and an additional formative.
(vi) The ways of questioning the manner in which something has been performed are ata,
ata ata, at@ta ‘how’. The form ata is polysemous with the manner demonstrative discussed in
10.2.2. Both ata and its repeated version ata ata are used to question someone’s physical state,
as in 10.100, speech reports, as in 10.101 (see §19.5), and names, as in 10.102:
10.100 m@n       ata ata
       you.masc how how
       ‘How are you? What’s happening to you?’
10.101 ata ata wa-na?
       how how say-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt
       ‘What did she say?’
10.102 ata marasin s@?
       how medicine name
       ‘What’s the name of the medicine?’
   The diﬀerence in meaning between ata ‘how’ and ata ata is that of emphasis: ata ata can be
translated as ‘exactly what?’ It is often used as an elliptical question, e.g. ata ata ‘what (did you
say)?’ The form ata is not used in such elliptical sentences. When ata occurs as predicate head
or as part of predicate focus, it takes the predicative -n, as in 10.103. The repeated form ata ata
cannot head a predicate or be focused.
10.103 a-d@              wa:y s@       ata-n-ad,        ma:?
       dem.dist-masc.sg magic name how-pred-3masc.sgnom again
       ‘What’s the name of the magic again?’
  The interrogative at@ta ‘how’ is used similarly to ata and ata ata, in the meaning of ‘how’,
as in T1.22 (ﬁrst line), from a story about a man who got upset about the moon making his
wife menstruate and decided to kill the moon. Both ata and ata ata were used in other versions
of T1.22. Unlike ata, at@ta is not used in non-interrogative clauses. Unlike both ata and ata
ata, it is not really used to question speech reports—it is used to question the manner of saying
things, including a word or an expression to be used, as in 13.10.
  This form often occurs with the same-subject purposive, as in 10.104, and also with the
desiderative, as an emphatic way of stating how impossible it is to do something:
10.104 ma:j at@ta wuk@-k
       talk how hear-purp.ss
       ‘How (am I to) hear the story (if children are screaming)?’
Similarly to ata in 10.102, at@ta can be used as a modiﬁer, ‘which kind of; how’:
10.105 ñ@n      at@ta gwalugw?
       you.fem how clan
       ‘What clan do you belong to?’
  Just like ata, at@ta can head a predicate or be in focus; then it takes the predicate marker -n,
as in 10.106:
230       10 Closed Classes10.106 ñ@n     at@ta-n-añ@n-@k
       you.fem how-pred-2fem.sgnom-conf
       ‘How are you? What’s the matter with you?’
  The form at@ta is etymologically connected with ata; possibly, it is the result of fusion of the
repeated ata ata. However, synchronically, these are diﬀerent forms.
  Three other forms are occasionally used in the meaning of ‘how’, as full synonyms of at@ta:
at@tawa, at@taka, and k@t@taka (the two latter ones were used by a speaker of the Malu
variety). 4
  Two adverbial manner demonstratives can occasionally acquire interrogative meanings,
atawa ‘thus, like that’ (10.107) and ak@tawa ‘like this’ (10.108), with very similar meanings.
Note the form of the negator in this clause: we return to the use of non-main clause negator in
questions in §14.5.
10.107 atawa         v@-ma:r-ñ@na-l
       how/like.that see-neg.sub-2fem.sgsubj.vt+3fem.sgbas.vt-3fem.sgnom
       ‘How come you didn’t see her?’ (lit. ‘how did it happen that you did not see her?’)
10.108 ak@tawa       k@-k-na-wun-@k
       how/like.this eat-fut-act.foc-1sgbas.vt-conf
       ‘How will I eat (uncooked food)?’
  The form ak@tawa in its interrogative use can occur with the locative case, in the same
meaning, ak@tawa-n-@m (how/like.this-pred-lk+loc) ‘how, in what way?’
  This polysemy between interrogatives and demonstratives is unique to adverbial manner
demonstratives, and not attested for nominal demonstratives. None of the forms discussed
here is used to enquire about degree—see 10.112 below.
(vii) The interrogative quantiﬁer kas ‘how many/much; which (by number)’ is always postposed
to the noun it quantiﬁes, as shown in 10.109 and 6.43 (countable referent) and in 10.110
(uncountable referent):
10.109 ñ@n     ñan-ugw kas?
       you.fem child-pl how.many/much
       ‘How many children do you have?’
10.110 ñ@ kas                    t@-na?
       sun how.many/much stay/have-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt
       ‘What time is it?’ (lit. How much sun is there?)
  This quantiﬁer is often used without an accompanying noun where it is obvious from the
context, as in 10.111:
10.111 d@-k@-k    kas               yapi-k@-tua-d?
       he-obl-dat how.many/much sell/pay-fut-1sgsubj.vt-3masc.sgbas.vt
       ‘How much shall I pay for him?’
  It never occurs in a focus construction. It can be used to enquire about size, with a size noun,
as in 10.112, and about the relative order, as in 10.113.
10.112 s@mi kas?
       length how.many/much
       ‘How long (is the stretch of cloth)?’
  4 Farnsworth and Farnsworth (1966) report the use of akata in the meaning of ‘how’; none of my consultants used
this form.
                                                                         10.5 Quantiﬁers        231  Motuway, who was sitting next to me chatting at a prayer meeting, missed the number of
the verse the preacher told everyone to read; she then asked (see 19.104 for kas in a reported
question):
10.113 vers kas              wa-na-d
       verse how.much/many say-act.foc-3masc.sgbas.vt
       ‘Which verse (by number) did he say?’
  Unlike any other interrogative (but similar to a noun), kas can be reduplicated yielding a
distributive meaning, as in 10.114:
10.114 kas-@-kas                             yapi-kwa-na-di?
       how.much/many-lk-how.much/many sell/pay-hab-act.foc-3plbas.vt
       ‘For how much do they sell each of these?’ (referring to cucumbers, sold individually at
       a local market)
   A questioned constituent can be part of the main (ﬁnal) clause, or of medial completive
clause (§18.3; also see example 9.33). Within a main clause, two constituents can be questioned,
as in 10.115.
10.115 akr@l    s@-k@-m             vyak?
       where.to who-obl-acc/loc hit+purp.ss
       ‘Where are you going to hit whom?’
   Two constituents in a medial clause cannot be questioned simultaneously; neither can one
constituent in the main clause, and one in the medial clause. That questions are a separate
clause type, diﬀerent from declarative clauses, is corroborated by the way in which they are
negated (as shown in 10.107); see §14.5.2 and also §20.1.3.
                                     10.5 q ua n t i f i e r sQuantiﬁers are a closed class of a couple of dozen members, covering the semantics of quantity
and arrangement. Quantiﬁers refer to large quantity; these include samasa:m ‘many’, æywan
‘quite a few (less than samasa:m)’, and its synonym mæy@k ‘many’ in the Malu variety. Two
frequently used quantiﬁers with the meaning of ‘all’ are miyawa ‘all’ and aba:b ‘all, all together’.
Speakers who frequently code-switch with Tok Pisin also use the quantiﬁer sampela ‘some’, as
in 10.17.
   These quantiﬁers can be used as modiﬁers to nouns, to verbs, and as heads of predicate.
When used as modiﬁers to nouns, a quantiﬁer can either precede or follow the noun, depend-
ing on its discourse status. A newly introduced or a non-topical referent is followed by the
quantiﬁer, as in 10.116. Once the referent has been established, the quantiﬁer precedes it. We
will see in §10.6 that numerals operate on a similar principle. In the very beginning of a story
(10.116) the speaker states that her foster father used to do a lot of work.
10.116 d@ yawi samasa:m kur-kwa-na-d
       he work much          do-hab-act.foc-3masc.sgbas.vt
       ‘He used to do a lot of work’
She then goes on to describe exactly what he did, and ﬁnally says 10.117.
10.117 samasam-a yawi kur-kwa-na-d
       much-lk      work do-hab-act.foc-3masc.sgbas.vt
       ‘(He) used to do a lot of the work (mentioned already)’
232      10 Closed Classes   Unlike numerals (but similarly to non-agreeing adjectives), the quantiﬁers take a linker when
used as preposed modiﬁers within NPs. Similarly to numerals (e.g. 7.50), they do not take case
markers, even when used as posthead modiﬁers (the case marker then goes onto the noun
head). The only quantiﬁer which can only be used postposed to the head is the interrogative
kas ‘how many/much’ (§10.4).
   All quantiﬁers can be used with countable and uncountable referents, except for aba:b ‘all’
which is preferred with countable referents. Its counterpart with uncountable and collective
referents is the quantiﬁer miya-wa (tree+lk-com) ‘all, whole’ (this contains the comitative in
a derivational function (§7.9, under E) and does not take any additional linker), e.g. aba:b-a
du-ta:kw (all-lk man-woman) ‘all the people (one by one)’, miyawa du-ta:kw ‘all the people as
a group’ (10.123); miyawa t@ p ‘the whole village (as a group)’. An NP of the form ?aba:b-a t@ p
is barely acceptable.
   The quantiﬁer aba:b ‘all’ can be used headlessly, as in 10.78. A preacher addressed his
congregation by saying vyak@t-a gan@b aba:b (good-lk morning all) ‘good morning all (of
you)’. A frequent headless use of this quantiﬁer may be due to calquing from Tok Pisin olgeta
‘all’.
   We saw in §7.9 (under E) that the comitative case can derive nouns with quantiﬁcational
meanings, such as t@pawa (village+lk+com) ‘the whole village; all villagers together’.
   The number agreement of a verb or an agreeing modiﬁer with an NP containing a quantiﬁer
depends on the countability of the referent, and the degree of individualization: if samasam-
a du-ta:kw (many-lk man-woman) ‘many people’ is treated as one non-diﬀerentiated group,
agreement is singular; if they are to be discussed as a set of groups, or individuals, agreement is
plural. Quantiﬁers modify nouns and verbs. Quantiﬁers as modiﬁer to verbs are illustrated in
10.118–19, and T3.43 (miyawa ‘all’).
10.118 samasa:m kwa-bana-l@k
       much      stay-1plsubj.vt+3fem.sgbas.vt-because
       ‘Because we stayed there as numerous (people) (there was not enough food)’
10.119 ata ma: ata samasa:m wuk@-l
       then again then lot           worry-3fem.sgbas.p
       ‘Then she worried a lot again’
  In 10.120, a quantiﬁer modiﬁes a copula complement (and acquires an intensifying mean-
ing). This is the only way of intensifying a copula complement, e.g. n@k@r samasa:m tay-na
(cold much be.nat-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt) ‘it is very cold’.
10.120 k@              jaguy       bæy samasa:m ada
       dem.prox.fem.sg yam.soup tasty much      dem.dist.react.top+masc.sg
       yi-na
       go-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt
       ‘This yam soup was very tasty’
  In 10.121, a quantiﬁer heads a predicate: it then takes nominal cross-referencing, as do most
non-verbs in this slot (see §3.1).
10.121 b@      æywan-adian
       already many-1plnom
       ‘We were already numerous’
  The form samasa:m has an inherently reduplicated form; the component sam- appears in a
compound sam-a-ja:p (all-lk-thing) meaning ‘all’, used as a modiﬁer to a verb, as in 10.122.
                                                                          10.5 Quantiﬁers        23310.122 du-ta:kw      b@      sam-a-ja:p      kamap@-na-d
       man-woman already many-lk-thing come.up-act.foc-3masc.sgbas.vt
       ‘People already appeared in big quantity’
   Two further quantiﬁers—less frequently used than the ones discussed above—with the
meaning ‘many’ appear to be just prehead modiﬁers, e.g. k@b in 10.123 and s@ p- in 10.124
(this latter form may be related to s@ p ‘body’):
10.123 miyawa k@b-a        du-ta:kw    k@t@k@tun t@-d@-d
       all      many-lk man-woman cut+seq have-3masc.sgsubj.p-3masc.sgbas.p

       go.down-fut-act.foc-1plbas.vt-conf
       ‘(We) all the people of that village would have gone down burning (if we hadn’t
       escaped)’
  As shown in §4.3.1, the two agreeing adjectives, kwasa ‘small’ and n@ma ‘big’, can be used
adverbially, with a quantifying meaning ‘(a) little’ and ‘a lot’. See 10.125 and 4.52:
10.125 kwasa        o n@ma,          gu      yaku-na-ñ@n?
       small.fem.sg or big.fem.sg water wash-act.foc-2fem.sgbas.vt
       ‘Have you washed a little, or a lot?’
   Note that neither kwasa nor n@ma in 10.125 are modiﬁers to gu ‘water’, the unmarked
argument of yaku- ‘wash’ (see §7.2): this noun in this function cannot be further modiﬁed,
and an intonation break (marked with a comma) between n@ma and gu indicates that they do
not form one NP.
   Using kwasa ‘small; a little’ is the only way of referring to a small quantity of either countable
or uncountable referents. We will see, in §10.6.1 below, that the numeral mugul ‘three’ can also
be used to mean ‘a few’ (with countable nouns). The adjective numa ‘big’ can be used as a
quantiﬁer only with uncountable referents (with countable referents, it is a size adjective).
   There is also a subtle diﬀerence between numa ‘big, a lot’ and samasa:m ‘much’ with
uncountable referents: numa gu ‘big water; a lot of water’ refers to one big lot of water, while
samasam-a gu (much-lk water) refers to large quantities of water which may be used for
washing, or drinking, at several diﬀerent times. In addition, only an agreeing size adjective
can modify a noun or an agreeing modiﬁer—that is, one can only say numa kru t@-na ñan
(big+fem.sg fat have-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt child) ‘a child who has a lot of fat’, but not
∗
  samasam-a kru (much fat). That is, the size adjective quantiﬁes the amount of a noun (10.126a,
10.127a: masculine gender refers to intensity and large quantity: §5.2.1), while the quantiﬁer
quantiﬁes the intensity of the verbal action and number of times it is performed (10.126b,
10.127b). The size adjective and the quantiﬁer samasa:m are contrasted in the following pairs
of examples:
10.126a numa-d@      yi-tukwa
        big-masc.sg go/say-proh.gen
        ‘Do not talk in a loud (voice)’

In addition to quantiﬁers, Manambu has a couple of dozen words referring to units and
arrangements, e.g. pui ‘parcel’ (e.g. na:gw pui nak (sago parcel one) ‘one parcel of sago’), tan
‘measure, bundle’ (as in ñapwi tan nak (ﬁrewood bundle one) ‘one bundle of ﬁrewood’), bæy ‘ﬂat
bundle, used for mats and limbum’, tukwi ‘heap, pile’, jib@l ‘arrangement of ﬁsh on a string’,
p@r @gabi ‘a small string of things, especially ﬁsh’, gwas ‘a big string or bundle’, bak ‘crowd’, s@
‘bundle (as of banana)’, and sa:y ‘bundle (of leaves)’, exempliﬁed in 10.128.
10.128 [tuay                      sa:y   tab@ti] ji-d@-di

       ‘They bound ten bundles of coconut tree leaves (to be used as torches)’
   These quantiﬁers are not numeral classiﬁers since they only optionally occur with numbers.
Their choice is determined by the ways in which the object is arranged and put into a particular
shape or form, rather than by its intrinsic properties (see Aikhenvald 2000: 114–19). Nouns
whose meaning is inherently shape or form based can be used as arrangement quantiﬁers, e.g.
yap ‘string; objects strung on a string’, dab ‘layer; layered objects’, tab@k ‘side, half’. These
straddle the boundaries between nouns and quantiﬁers.
                                       10.6 numeralsNumerals form a largish albeit closed class of non-agreeing modiﬁers. Numerals one to ten
form one phonological and grammatical word each, while all other numerals consist of more
than one word. Speakers vary in their competence with respect to numbers higher than
twenty. We discuss numerals from one to ten, and those higher than ten, in §10.6.1 and
§10.6.2.","[253, 254, 255, 256, 257, 258, 259, 260, 261]"
"Distinguishing code-switches and borrowings in Manambu presents a problem.
  Borrowings and code-switches are usually considered extremes on a continuum (see the
glossary in Aikhenvald and Dixon 2006). They can be potentially distinguished by (i) frequency
of occurrence (code-switches are often one-oﬀ occurrences); (ii) phonological integration; (iii)
morpho-syntactic integration; and (iv) a number of lexical criteria:
  (a) Does an equivalent exist in the other language?
  (b) If so, is it in use in the community?
  (c) Is the equivalent known to the speaker?
  (d) To which language does the individual regard the word as belonging?
  (e) Is it in use by monolingual speakers?
   Most Tok Pisin insertions are high in frequency. There are no monolinguals in Manambu,
and most ‘inserts’ can be provided with a Manambu equivalent. Even ad hoc and one-oﬀ occur-
rences of Tok Pisin—and of Papua New Guinea English—words tend to be phonologically and
morphosyntactically integrated.
   The absence of full phonological integration may provide a partial clue. The phoneme f ,
shared by Tok Pisin and PNG English but absent from Manambu, is realized either as f or as
p; the two are in free variation, as in faivpela du, paipela, faipela du (ﬁve:tp man) ‘ﬁve men’.
The English tS appears in code-switches as a foreign import, as in tatSi-tukwa (touch-proh.gen)
‘don’t touch!’ Borrowings and code-switches may contain consonant clusters absent from Man-
ambu, e.g. faivpela ‘ﬁve:tp’, i ntrestin t@-na (interesting:E stand/be-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt) ‘it
is interesting’, and the vowel e. Loans and code-switches may display variability atypical of
Manambu forms: for instance Tok Pisin loan, or code-switch, sekan ‘shake hands’ is often
pronounced in a somewhat Anglicized way sekhan. However, all these can be considered tokens
of loan phonology in Manambu. Borrowings, and code-switches, may also present a problem
in terms of how they are assigned to word classes—see §22.4.2, and §4.5.6.
   Here is an example of how an ad hoc English import can quickly become morphologically
integrated. At the start of a whole-night working session with John Sepaywus, Pauline Yuaneng
                                              22.4 Inﬂuence of Tok Pisin and of English          607Laki presented him with a lengthy list of totemic terms for various important objects she had
previously compiled (see the end of §21.5.3). She then asked me, in English, to ‘tick’ the forms
she had got right as we would go through each of them one by one. John Sepaywus tuned in
immediately, and, whenever the term was right, kept telling me a-tik (impv-tick) ‘tick (it)’. No
one in the Manambu community used this verb in their Manambu before or after. So, this
could be considered a one-oﬀ code-switch—yet it was highly morphologically integrated. And
that night it exceeded any other verb in its frequency.
   Other foreign imports are more frequent than tik-, but less morphologically integrated. For
instance, some never occur with the imperative preﬁx: one says sekan, or sekhan ‘shake hands!’,
but never ∗ a-sekan, or ∗ a-sekhan—yet this is the term spontaneously used by most people (see
§21.5.3 on its Manambu equivalents). Alternatively, sekhan could be considered an interjection,
or an unsegmentable one-word command.
   The only bona ﬁde borrowings could be the ones for which there is no Manambu equivalent,
and which are considered part of the language by at least some speakers. The problem is that
speakers vary in their judgements. Consider the term for ‘peanuts’, nowadays a major cash crop
for Manambu women. I asked one highly proﬁcient speaker how to say ‘peanut’ in Manambu.
Her response was kasan—which is one of the two Tok Pisin terms for ‘peanut’. Her husband,
one of the Manambu ‘purists’ (we return to this in §22.6), told her oﬀ for using a Tok Pisin
import; what he suggested instead was galip—which is also a loan from Tok Pisin galip ‘peanut’.
He did not seem to be aware of the Tok Pisin provenance for this word.
   The expression m@n-a waya:m (you.masc-lk+fem.sg way+lk+loc) ‘(let it be done in) your
way’ was considered good enough Manambu by one speaker; where another one rejected it
as a blatant foreignism (he suggested m@n-a-r @b (you.masc-lk-fully) instead). Both speakers
rejected laiki- as a term for ‘like’ as an obvious Tok Pisin form (laikim), suggesting mawul kwa-
na (inside stay-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt, lit. inside stay), or m@yakw kwa-na instead. The fact
remains that laiki- is used very frequently by all generations of speakers, even by those whose
Tok Pisin is not 100 per cent.
   These examples show that Tok Pisin and English code-switches and borrowings in Manambu
form a hard-to-parse continuum. Borrowings and code-switches span all the open and semi-
open word classes. They include:  r nouns, e.g. ailan (T1.11), ailand (T1.10) ‘island’, mani ‘money’ (21.4), bus ‘bush’ (T1.21),
    stori ‘story’ (21.37), taim ‘time’ (T2.54), pas ‘letter’ in 22.6, and taul ‘towel’ and beg ‘bag’
    in 22.32a, c;
  r non-agreeing adjectives, e.g. colour adjectives grin ‘green’, blu ‘blue’, dimension adjectives
    such as liklik ‘small’, bigpela ‘big’, physical property adjectives, such as strongpela ‘strong’,
    and indeﬁnite adjective sampela ‘some’;
  r adverbs, e.g. hariap ‘quickly’, from Tok Pisin hariap ‘quickly’, olsem ‘thus, like this’, from
    Tok Pisin olsem ‘thus’, ken ‘again’, from Tok Pisin ken ‘again’, the negator nogat ‘no, this
    is not the case’, from Tok Pisin nogat ‘there is not’;
  r numerals, e.g. wanpela ‘one’, tupela, tu ‘two’ (also see T2.21);
  r quantiﬁers, e.g. planti ‘plenty’, from Tok Pisin planti (22.36);
  r conjunctions, e.g. sapos ‘if, suppose’, from Tok Pisin sapos ‘if’ (22.8) and tasol ‘only,
    contrastive linker’, from Tok Pisin tasol ‘only, but’ (T2.3, 22.7), o ‘or’ (T2.50), and even
    clause-chaining markers nau ‘then, as soon as’ (Tok Pisin nau ‘then’) and pinis ‘completive’
    (Tok Pisin pinis ‘completive aspect marker’).","[633, 634]"

           16.1.3 Bound directionals and directional suﬃxes: a comparisonBound directionals (A–C in §16.1.2) and directional suﬃxes (D in §16.1.2) share a major
semantic function: both provide directional speciﬁcation to the clause. Yet, they diﬀer in a
number of grammatical properties summarized in Table 16.4 and discussed below.
I. Valency changing is a property of bound directionals. A strictly intransitive verb with
a bound directional has a telic meaning and an obligatory directional speciﬁcation. There is
often a noun phrase specifying the direction of action. An example is at 16.57:
                                                                            16.1 Directionals      399Table 16.4 Directional suﬃxes and bound directionals Property                              Directional suffixes (D)        Bound directionals (A–C) I.

      ground-lk+all jump-down-3masc.sg-compl.ds wa!
      ‘That snake there jumped downwards, onto the ground, after he had jumped (there was
      a sound) wa!’   A directional with an intransitive non-motion verb makes it telic, and adds a resultative
overtone, as in 16.63 (puku-su- (bulge/get.fat-up) ‘get big’).
   A directional used with an ambitransitive verb of either S=O or S=A type has a diﬀerent
eﬀect: it restricts the verb’s transitivity to just its transitive use. We will see, in §16.2, that the
causative-manipulative kay- may have a similar eﬀect.
   The verb t@p- ‘be closed, fence oﬀ’ is an S=O ambitransitive. With a directional, it is always
transitive, as illustrated in 16.23, 16.30, and 10.22b (also see 12.3). The eﬀect of a directional
is similar to that of -taka ‘put’ as V2 in asymmetrical compounds (see 15.62–3). The verb
piñu- ‘slide, slip’ is an S=O ambitransitive. If accompanied by a bound directional, it has a
transitive meaning: piñu-sada-tua (slide-down-1sgsubj.vt+3fem.sgbas.vt) means ‘I slide (it)
downwards’. The verb ‘look’ used with a directional means ‘look at something; in the direction
of something’, or ‘with a particular purpose’—see examples 16.12, 16.19, 16.34, and especially
16.55–6. If the verb ‘say’ is used with a directional, the addressee needs to be expressed, as in
16.6, or understood as in 16.10.
   The valency-changing or, better, valency-adjusting eﬀect of bound directionals is especially
clear with the general verb m@gi- ‘do whatever, happen’, which is S=O=A ambitransitive.
Without a directional, it can have any transitivity value, depending on what the speaker has
in mind. In 16.58a it is used transitively:16.58a kam@m                m@gi-d@-d
       breadfruit+lk+acc do.whatever-3masc.sgsubj.p-3masc.sgbas.p
       ‘He did whatever to breadfruit’ (in the context: grabbed the breadfruit)   Its intransitive use is shown in 16.58b—this example shows that m@gi- is an S=A ambitran-
sitive:
400      16 Directionals and Valency-Changing Devices16.58b yakraw m@gi-da-l
       thunder do.whatever-3masc.sgsubj.vt+3fem.sgbas.vt-3fem.sgnom
       ‘It was that (that time) thunder did whatever’ (in the context: struck)
  An example like 16.58c shows that the verb m@gi- is also an S=O ambitransitive:
16.58c l@-k@               mæn atawa       m@gi-l-a
       she-obl+fem.sg leg like.that do.whatever-3fem.sgbas.p-3fem.sgnom
       ‘It is the case that her leg whatevered like that’ (in the context: her leg became paralysed)
   If accompanied by a directional, m@gi- has to be transitive, and also refer to a telic action.
Examples are 16.16, 16.42 (also see the full paradigm at 16.2), and 16.58d (here the omitted O
is the foot).
16.58d [a-m@gi-su]            [k@                mæn n@k@r n@k@r kur-kwa]
       impv-do.whatever-up dem.prox.fem.sg foot cold cold get-impv.3p+fem.sg
       ‘Whatever it (the foot) up (in context: put your foot up), may your foot get really cool’
   In contrast, the directional suﬃxes -tay ‘sideways away from speaker’ and -tæy ‘sideways
towards speaker’ do not have any such eﬀect: m@gi-tay- (do.whatever-to.side.away) may mean
either ‘move or aﬀect (something) to side’, or ‘move itself to side’; piñu-tay-tayan (slide-
to.side.away-to.side.away+seq) means ‘sliding side to side’, and may also mean ‘make some-
thing slide side to side’, depending on the context.
   That is, one set of directionals aﬀects transitivity, and the other set does not. The inherently
directional verbs—each of which corresponds to a bound directional (Table 16.1)—do not
aﬀect the verb’s valency (see §15.2, and also V below). The morphological make-up of the
bound directionals accounts for their valency-changing eﬀect. As mentioned above, they could
be composed of the transitive verb s@- ‘put, plant’ followed by an inherently directional verb.
We can recall that verbs sada- ‘put down’ and saku- ‘push outwards’ which contain s@- as an
intrinsically directional verb are transitive.
   This corroborates our hypothesis that the transitive verb s@- ‘put, plant’ imparts a transi-
tivizing value to these morphemes.
II. Adverbial usage is a property of a few bound directional forms, such as -su ‘upwards’ in
16.59–61 and -saku ‘outwards’ in 16.29. We can recall, from Table 16.1, that the directional
-su is unusual in that it is not directly relatable to an inherently directional verb, unlike other
directionals in the paradigm. In their adverbial usage, the directionals modify the verb, as does
the form wuk@-su (listen-up) used in the sense of ‘lending one’s ear’ while listening, in 16.59
(repeated from T3.30; a similar example is in T3.27).
16.59 [a    gapum            wuk@-su kui-n                  aka
      then big.post+lk+loc listen-up give.to.third.p-seq dem.dist.react.top.fem.sg
      ra:l]
      sit+3fem.sgbas.p
      ‘Having gone to another house, she sat on the big post listening to what was above’
  The versatile nature of the form wuk@-su becomes apparent in an adjacent sentence within
the same story (T3.31) where this same form occurs as a bona ﬁde verb, wuk@-su:n (listen-
up+seq) ‘having listened (to what was above)’. A similar example, with the directional -saku
‘outwards’, is at 16.29 (second line).
  A directional verb used adverbially can mark manner, as in 16.60:
                                                                      16.1 Directionals      40116.60 k@                bagula-man@m          yak@-su

      kayk@t@-d@-l,                             a-d@                apan      du
      hold.onto-3masc.sgsubj.p-3fem.sgbas.p dem.dist-masc.sg old.masc man
      ‘He held on to (the tree) by throwing this ankle of his foot upwards, that old man’
  This is reminiscent of the directionals used with ‘look’. But, unlike any other directional, it
can be used with the inﬂected predicate ellipsed, as in 16.8.
The directional -su ‘up’ used with the generic verb s@- ‘put, plant’ in 16.61 has a somewhat
idiomatic meaning, ‘upwards/upstream a little bit’.
16.61 [Sapaday s@-su waku-n]             [al@m              taka-d@-k]               [wun

      then come-1masc.sgbas.vt
      ‘(A group from) Japanday having gone out a little bit upstream, established themselves
      there (lit. put (line) ), then I came’
  We can recall, from A above, that the directional -su ‘up’ does not refer to the upstream
direction—unlike the directional -war in ka-war- ‘bring/take upwards or upstream’. The form
s@su is unlike other directionals in an additional way—it can be used in a noun phrase, similarly
to a postposition, as 16.62.
16.62 wuka-n-aka                                                  haiskul

      stay-3fem.sgsubj.vt+3fem.sgbas.vt+com put-up
      ‘Here it is (closer to you), upstream from where the high school is’
   Verbal forms marked with directional suﬃxes -tay ‘sideways away from speaker’ and -tæy
‘sideways towards speaker’ are never used adverbially.
III. Reduplication of a directional is an exclusive property of the directional suﬃx -tay
‘sideways away from speaker’ (see 12.67, 12.70, 16.47). No other directional, including -tæy
‘sideways towards speaker’, can be reduplicated.
IV. Lexicalization is a property of many directionals, especially those meaning ‘across away’
and ‘outwards’— -saki and -saku, and -tay. A few verb roots only occur accompanied by
directionals, e.g. r@m-su (?-up) ‘come up (plants in a garden); heap up (ground)’.
V. Potential replacement with a partly synonymous directional verb is a property of
bound directionals. The directional suﬃxes do not have this option.
   There are two alternatives. The ﬁrst one is to use a verb compound with an inherently
directional verb as V2 . The compound describes something happening while moving in one
of the six directions encoded in inherently directional verbs—that is, concomitant motion (also
see §15.2.2, examples 15.6 and 15.8–12).
   Verb forms with bound directionals do not have an additional movement overtone. In
contrast, they indicate the directionality of the action upon an object. They may also imply
that the position of an object in space was aﬀected.
   The pairs in Table 16.5 illustrate the diﬀerent semantic eﬀect of verb compounds with
inherently directional verbs, and of bound directionals, with the verb yak@- ‘throw’ which
implies motion and directionality, and with the verb yaku- ‘wash’ which does not.
402     16 Directionals and Valency-Changing DevicesTable 16.5 Verb compounds and bound directionals: a comparison Compound with inherently directional V2          Verb with bound directional yak@-war- (throw-go.up) ‘throw and go            yak@-su- ‘throw something upwards’
 upwards or upstream’ yak@-da- (throw-go.down) ‘throw and go           yak@-sada- ‘throw something downwards’
 downwards or downstream’ yaku-war- ‘wash and go upwards or upstream’      yaku-su- ‘wash in upward direction, e.g. a
                                                  mount or a heap of sago; wash something
                                                  that is heaped up’ yaku-da- ‘wash and go downwards or               yaku-sada- ‘wash in a downward direction;
 downstream’                                      wash something that is located below oneself’ ñam-væki- ‘chew and go across’                   ñam-saki- ‘chew with sideways mouth
                                                  movements’  If a verb does not imply directionality, an inherently directional V2 may refer to a process,
and a bound directional describes reaching a state. An example is at 16.63:
16.63 [ata puku-su-b@r]                 [pukupuku-war@n                t@-br@-k . . . ]
      then bulge/get.fat-up-3dubas.vt/p bulge/get.fat:red-go.up+seq stay-3du-compl.ds
      ‘Then they two got big. As they were getting bigger and bigger (lit. going up in getting
      fat) . . . ’
A verb can combine with either an inherently directional verb or with a directional, if its
meaning is compatible with the idea of concomitant motion or directionality. Directionals do
not occur on atelic verbs. So, kwak@-su- (look.for-up) ?? ‘look for upwards’ is not acceptable;
but in an appropriate context it can mean ‘ﬁnd in an upward direction’.
  The second alternative is a verb-sequencing construction (which can be considered biclausal:
see §18.1). Then, one verb is marked with the sequencing -n and the other verb is fully inﬂected.
The meaning of the sequence is that of concomitant actions and manner. An example is at
16.64, underlined.
16.64 a-d@               m@d-a          ñan ada                             p@k@-yi:n
      dem.dist-masc.sg cassowary-lk child dem.dist.react.top+masc.sg jump-go+seq
      væki-yi:d
      go.across-go+3masc.sgbas.vt/p
      ‘That cassowary’s son (topical) went across (the hole) by continuously jumping’
  If the construction ‘jumping he went across’ in 16.64 were replaced with a verb plus a
directional, p@k@-saki- (jump-across.away), it would be grammatical, but its meaning would
have been simply ‘jump across in the direction away from reference point’.
  Semantic aﬃnity between a directional compound and a corresponding verb of motion is
corroborated by examples like 16.65: the verb ‘go downstream’ in the second clause echoes the
directional ‘down’ in the ﬁrst clause:
16.65 [laku-sada-d@-k]                 [da:n        kwa-d]
      pull-down-3masc.sg-compl.ds go.down+seq stay-3masc.sg.bas.vt/p
      ‘After he’d pulled it (canoe) down (from bank), it stayed on water (going) downstream’
                                                                         16.1 Directionals        403   The sequencing construction in 16.66 shows that a bound directional imparts a some-
what diﬀerent meaning to the verb from an inherently directional verb. Here, the direc-
tional refers to jumping up, and the inherently directional verb describes concomitant
motion:
16.66 p@k@-su-yak@-n       war@-d
      jump-up-fully-seq go.up-3masc.sgbas.vt/p
      ‘It (the snake) jumped up fully and went up (into the house)’
   A verb containing two directionals (see §16.1.4) can be rephrased with a compound, and a
sequencing construction, since a compound cannot contain two verbs of motion. So, p@k@-su-
sada- (jump-up-down) meaning ‘jump up and down in the same place’ (see §16.1.4) can be
rephrased as p@k@-war@n p@k@-da-n (jump-go.up+seq jump-go.down-seq) meaning ‘jump while
moving up and down (e.g. on a ladder)’.
   If an intrinsically directional verb ‘carry, bring’ requires an additional directional speciﬁca-
tion, it is likely to be used in a compound with an inherently directional verb as V2 : ka-war-
waku- (carry/bring-up-go out) in 15.7 can mean ‘carry (things) upwards (e.g. to the house)
and out’, or ‘carry (things) upwards and go out’. An alternative is a biclausal sequencing
construction, as in 16.67:
16.67 ka-war-@n        karya-tua-di
      ‘bring’-up-seq take.away-1sgsubj.vt-3plbas.vt
      ‘I will take (plates) carrying them up (to the house)’
  The verb karya- ‘take away’ develops idiomatic meanings in sequencing constructions, e.g.
wuk@-n karya-n (think-seq take.away-seq) ‘remember, remind’. Just as with bound directionals,
the verb implying movement ‘away’ is more prone to developing idiomatic overtones than its
counterpart meaning ‘towards’.
We conclude that, synchronically, Manambu has two independent grammatical systems: that
of two directional suﬃxes (neither of which has a corresponding inherently directional verb)
and that of six bound directionals (each with a corresponding inherently directional verb). A
directional suﬃx and a bound directional cannot co-occur in one verb. We will now discuss the
ways in which bound directionals can appear together.","[425, 426, 427, 428, 429, 430]"

                                      4.5.2 PostpositionsPostpositions form a small closed class, of three members: k@t@k ‘like; similarly’, e.g. du k@t@k
‘like a man’, wuk@n ‘together with’, and kuk@- ‘behind’. All of them follow their nominal
argument. No other constituent can intervene between them. The third person pronouns and
the interrogative s@ ‘who’ do not take the oblique marker -k@- when used as postpositional
arguments of the ﬁrst two, e.g. d@ k@t@k (he like) ‘like him’.
   The three postpositions diﬀer in a number of properties. The postposition k@t@k ‘like;
similarly’ does not require a linker on the noun, as shown in 4.67:

     smoking.grid+lk+loc smoke-3fem.sgsubj.p-3masc.sgbas.p pig like
     ‘She smoked him on a smoking grid like a pig’
  The suﬃx -p@k ‘like, almost like’ implies comparative likeness, while k@t@k implies just about
full similarity; to express complete similarity, the suﬃx -r@b ‘straight, fully’ is used (see the
discussion in §9.2). A noun phrase containing k@t@k is syntactically an oblique which cannot
be cross-referenced in the second position; it can head a predicate or occupy the copula
complement slot, e.g. du k@t@k-al (man like-3fem.sgnom) ‘(she) is/was like a man’; but cannot
be used as a modiﬁer or as an argument of a verb. This postposition may have an approximative
meaning, as in nabi mugul a:li k@t@k (year three four like) ‘about three or four years of age’. A
somewhat archaic variant of k@t@k is kayt@k.
                                                                       4.5 Closed classes       105   The postposition wuk@n ‘together’ (homonymous with the sequential form wuk@-n (hear-
seq.manner) ‘hearing, understanding, feeling’) does not require a linker on the noun it governs.
It marks the second subject participant in the argument elaboration (‘inclusory’) construction
(§6.2.3), as in 4.68 and 6.38.
4.68 an     [Aulapan wuk@n] Sarak-abran
     we.du Aulapan with       Sarak-1dunom
     ‘The two of us, Aulapan and I, are of the Sarak clan’
   It can also mark an oblique participant which is not cross-referenced, e.g. ‘with his mother’
in 4.69:
4.69 ata wuk@-ku               gra-dian    [d@-k@           amæy wuk@n]
     then hear/feel-compl.ss cry-1plbas.p he-obl+fem.sg mother with
     d@-k@                   ma:k v@-ma:r-ku                ata gra-dian
     3masc.sg-obl+3fem.sg person see-neg.sub-compl.ss then cry-1plbas.p
     ‘Then feeling sorry (for the missing boy) we (all) cried, together with his mother, not
     having seen him in person (and suspecting the worst), we then cried’
  It can occur on its own if the noun is recoverable from the context, as in 4.70:
4.70 wuk@n a-kray
     with impv-bring
     ‘Bring (glasses) with you!’
   The postposition wuk@n is similar in meaning to the comitative case (see §7.9). The diﬀerence
is the degree of participation: if all the participants are equally involved, comitative is used. If
not, wuk@n is preferred. A speaker said 4.71, rather than 4.72, because an 11-year-old, however
smart, could not be an equal participant in an adult women’s job of going to a market to sell
and buy things.
4.71 maketar       l@-k@    wuk@n yi-k-na-bran
     market+all she-obl with go-fut-act.foc-1dubas.vt
     ‘We two will go to the market, (me) with her (11-year-old girl)’
4.72 l@-k@-wa      yi-k-na-bran
     she-obl-com go-fut-act.foc-1dubas.vt
     ‘We two will (go to the market), (me) with her’
   Younger speakers who frequently code-switch with Tok Pisin replace wuk@n with its syn-
onym, the Tok Pisin code-switch wantaim, e.g. m@n-a wantaim, m@n wuk@n ‘with you (mas-
culine)’. Some use wuk@n in the context where a comitative is expected; 4.73 is an example
of wuk@n—spontaneously produced by Janet and addressed to her daughter, Joana—where
a double comitative construction (§7.9 and §6.2.3) would have been more appropriate for a
traditional speaker.
4.73 yi-k-ñ@na,                                   [t@p-a     kudi      wuk@n] [wali

     language with
     ‘You will speak, (in) the village language together with the white people’s language’
106     4 Word ClassesThe argument of this postposition, rather than the whole NP, can be focused (§20.3):
4.74 [ [Kay-a-wa Harold-ad]focus           wuk@n] kwa-tu@-l
     Kay-lk-com Harold-3masc.sgnom with             stay-1sgsubj.p-3fem.sgbas.p
     gabu-ma:j-a
     traditional-story-3fem.sgnom
     ‘This is the story of me staying together with (focused) Harold and Kay’
   Just like k@t@k, an NP containing this postposition can occur in the predicate slot. It cannot
occupy the copula complement slot, or be used as a modiﬁer or an argument of the verb unless
it occurs as part of the argument elaboration construction, as in 4.71–2.
   The postposition kuk@- ‘at the back of; behind; after’ is only superﬁcially similar to the other
two postpositions. The root kuk@- takes three local cases: locative, with the meaning ‘behind’, as
in d@-k@ kuk-@-m r @-d-@ du (he-obl behind-lk-loc sit-3masc.sgbas.vt-lk man) ‘a man sitting
behind him’; allative, with the meaning of ‘towards the direction of behind something’, as in
4.75; and terminative, meaning ‘exactly behind something’, as in 4.61 above. It always requires
a linker. In these respect it is noun-like (however, it is not used as a noun, ‘back’).
4.75 [ñan-a kuk-@-r]         ya-n      væki-n         t@-na-di
     we.pl-lk back-lk-all come-seq go.across-seq stand-act.foc-3plbas.vt
     ‘(Soldiers) were coming across towards behind us’
   An NP containing kuk@- can modify a noun. [Yuajan kuk-@-b-a] du (Yuajan:female.name
behind-lk-term-lk man) means ‘male (son) (born) after Yuajan’; this was used to describe the
sequence of children, by Gemaj. This example also shows that the spatial meaning ‘behind’ is
extended to temporal, ‘after’ (also see 13.43).
   Any of the case forms of kuk@- can be used without an argument, that is, similarly to a
locative adverb. Sometimes the argument of kuk@- can be recovered from the context, as in the
mother’s answer to my question why the baby was crying, under 13.43 (‘she wants to go out
after (her)’). No such argument is ‘recoverable’ in 4.76—this is an example of an adverbial-like
use of kuk@-:
4.76 wun k@ka-n-aka                                bla-tu@-l            kuk-@-m
     I    dem.prox.react.top-pred-react.top talk-1sgsubj.p-3fem.sgbas.p back-lk-loc
     ‘Here (I am), this is what I said afterwards’
Just like any other adverb (Table 4.4), a case-marked form of kuk@- can be used as
a modiﬁer of a noun, e.g. kuk@r ñan (behind+all child) ‘last child’, kuk@-s@buk (back-
high.degree.of.initiated.man) ‘the most senior of simbuks’ (also used for ‘high priest’, in Bible
translation).
   Unlike any other postpositions, but similarly to body part terms, kuk@- can appear in part–
whole possessive constructions, as in kuk@-tag (back-tank) ‘back of the (water)tank’, kuk@-ab
‘back of the head’, kuk@-t@k@r (back-chair) ‘back of the chair’, kuk@-wi ‘back of the house’
combining the reference to the back part of something and to the spatial orientation. This
construction type is typical for body part and spatial orientation terms: compare mutam ‘face’,
mut@m-a-wi (face-lk-house) ‘in front of the house’, mut@m-a-t@k@r ‘in front of the chair’, ma:l
‘side’, mal-a-wi (side-lk-house) ‘side of the house’, and so on. (The question of what is the
head in these constructions is addressed in §8.1.2.)
   The only diﬀerence between body part terms and kuk@- is that kuk@- does not occur on its
own, and can only take the three locational cases. In addition, a part–whole construction with
                                                                        4.5 Closed classes       107kuk@- cannot be paraphrased with any other possessive construction (§8.1.2). That is, mut@m-
a-wi (face-lk-house) ‘in front of the house’ can be rephrased (with a change in meaning) as
wi l@-k@ mutam (house 3fem.sg-obl+fem.sg face) ‘the front, or the face, of the house’; while
kuk@-wi cannot be paraphrased in the same way.
  Occasionally, kuk@- can occur in the headless possessive construction marked with the
possessive suﬃx -k@-, as in 4.77:
4.77 a-d@                 [ta:y kaw] væ-ku,           [kuk@-k@-d@         kaw] ata
     dem.dist-masc.sg before hole dig-compl.ss back-poss-masc.sg hole then
     væ-br@-d
     dig-3dusubj.p-3masc.sgbas.p
     ‘Having dug the ﬁrst hole, having put up the fence, having come there, then they dug the
     next hole (lit. the hole belonging to the back), having stood up the fence’
   Similarly to a noun, the form kuk@- appears in a few modiﬁer-noun compounds (see §9.3),
e.g. kuk@-ya:b (back-road) ‘sideroad’. Some of these are somewhat unpredictable in meaning:
kuk@-m@l v@- (back-eye see) means ‘look back’ (as in 21.15).
   Two analytic options arise. We can consider kuk@- a special kind of ‘bound’ body part and
orientational noun, since it shares a number of syntactic properties with them, but never occurs
on its own. Or we can consider it a special word class: a bound noun which forms the base for
the spatial postpositions ‘behind’, and shares similarities with the two other postpositions,
k@t@k ‘like’ and wuk@n ‘with’ which have no corresponding bound noun forms. Both analyses
are adequate. I opt for the second one simply because of the syntactic similarities between the
postpositional structures.
   In summary: postpositions form a heterogeneous class. They appear to be a Manambu
innovation, given that other Ndu languages appear not to have any postpositions.","[131, 132, 133, 134]"
"   Cognates of the Manambu feminine singular -l are attested in Iatmul l1 ‘she; 3fem.sg agree-
ment marker’, Hanga Kundi lé ‘personal pronoun; subject agreement suﬃx’ (Wendel 1993: 59),
Ambulas lé ‘she’, and Boiken (Yangoru) l@ (Laycock 1965). Also see Appendix 22.1.
   A ø-marked feminine could be a Manambu-Gala innovation, cf. Gala a ‘third person
singular feminine bound pronoun’ (Laycock 1965: 133), and third person feminine singular
free pronoun ki ‘she’ as opposed to third person masculine singular k@l, k@r ‘he’.
   Cognates to the Manambu second person masculine pronoun and agreement marker m@n
are found throughout the family. And so are the cognates to the Manambu second person
feminine ñ@n. The only partial exception to this pattern is found in Gala—see Table 22.1.
Personal pronouns in Manambu are added for comparison (repeated from Table 3.3).
   A striking feature of this paradigm is the gender distinction in ﬁrst person. The Proto-Ndu
∗
  ñ@n(@) ‘second person singular feminine’ was reinterpreted as ﬁrst person singular feminine,
and yin co-opted as second person feminine. The form yin is cognate with the second person
feminine yine in Boiken (Freudenburg 1979; also see Aikhenvald forthcoming b). The third
person pronoun contains the stem k@- cognate to the Ndu proximate demonstrative (e.g.
Manambu k@-). The third person feminine form is formally less marked than the masculine
form k@r/k@l. The latter contains the masculine marker -l which is a regular correspondent of
Proto-Ndu ∗ d, as in Manambu du versus Gala lu ‘man’.
   Manambu also shares a considerable amount of nominal, and of verbal, lexicon with other
Ndu languages. Structural and formal similarities between Manambu and Iatmul may have
been enhanced by constant contact (see below, §22.3, on the loans from Iatmul). A number
of innovations are shared with the Abelam-Wosera group. We can recall, from §4.2.2, that
Manambu shares the formal distinction and the marking of ‘give to third person’ and ‘give
to non-third person’ with Abelam-Wosera. This distinction is absent from all other Ndu
languages, and is not reconstructible for Proto-Ndu.
   Historically, Manambu must have undergone a strong diﬀusional impact from non-Ndu
sources (such as Kwoma—see §22.2.3). This may explain why it is morphologically more com-
plex than most other Ndu languages. For instance, Manambu has more case forms, modalities,
directionals, and negators than any other Ndu language. At the same time, certain morphemes
                                                     22.1 Manambu as a Ndu language          593                                      non-singular      dual 3rd person/2nd person (A;B)      plural marker on kinship terms(C)     associative plural(D)Chart 22.1 Putative semantic development of the polysemous morpheme -b@r in Manambufound in other Ndu languages have been lost in Manambu. We saw in §21.1.1 that the cognate
of a nominalizing suﬃx -va:k, highly productive in Iatmul as a word class-changing device, and
as a complementation strategy, survives in Manambu in just one formation: k@-k@-pa:t (eat-eat-
der) ‘raw food’ (see 20.58 and 20.65). Synchronically, this form is no longer segmentable.
   Manambu underwent a number of phonological processes and mergers. We saw in §4.1.1
that Manambu lost the ﬁnal vowels of Proto-Ndu disyllabic nouns whose ﬁnal syllable ends
in a stop. In each case, the lost vowel surfaces as the linker when a noun occurs with a case
marker, or as a modiﬁer (cf. takwa:k ‘to woman’, ñ@ga:k ‘to leaf’, etc.). Some of the forms
Manambu shares with the unrelated Kwoma maintain the ﬁnal vowel in at least one Kwoma
dialect (Bangwis, documented by Bowden 1997: see §22.2.3). This may indicate that the early
Kwoma–Manambu contact pre-dated the Manambu ﬁnal vowel loss.
   A number of Proto-Ndu distinctions in word-ﬁnal stops are neutralized in Manambu. Not
surprisingly, this has created numerous homonymous morphemes. Consider the suﬃx -b@r ,
which has four meanings in Manambu:
  (A) second person dual basic and subject cross-referencing marker (see Chapter 3);
  (B) third person dual number agreement marker on agreeing modiﬁers (see Chapter 5) and
      in verbal basic and subject cross-referencing paradigms (see Chapter 3);
  (C) plural marker on a limited number of kinship terms (see §6.1); and
  (D) marker of associative non-singular with personal names only (see §6.1).
  Synchronically speaking, this can be described as an instance of polysemy of a marker with a
general meaning of ‘non-singular’. An inventive analyst could invoke the widespread polysemy
of second and third person dual marking in New Guinea languages (and elsewhere)—this
would account for a link between (A) and (B).
  Non-singular marking on a personal name often has an associative reading, as it does in
English (e.g. The Smiths, understood as ‘Smith and his associates’, rather than ?’many Smiths’:
see Moravcsik 2003). And it is well known that nouns with high animate and human referents
are more likely to be overtly marked for plural than nouns of other groups (see Smith-Stark
1974; Stebbins 1997; and Aikhenvald 2000). That is, (C) and (D) are also connected.
  One can thus establish the semantic chain of Manambu-internal development for a putative
‘non-singular’ suﬃx -b@r as in Chart 22.1.
  However, cognates with other Ndu languages tell us a diﬀerent story. The four synchronically
distinguishable morphemes (A–D) with the phonological shape -b@r go back to three distinct
markers:
(A) b@r ‘2du’ goes back to Proto-Ndu ∗ b@n(e) ‘second person dual’ (cf. Wosera beni, Abelam
béné, Gala ben (Table 22.1 above) (also see Laycock 1965: 152); Iatmul b1t (Staalsen n.d.b), bi’k
(Jendraschek, p.c.), Boiken ple (Freudenburg 1979)) (just as Manambu gwur ‘2pl’ corresponds
to Wosera, Abelam guni, guné, Gala gun, Iatmul guk, Boiken kle, from Proto-Ndu ∗ gun(e)).
(These correspondences are regular—see Aikhenvald forthcoming b.)
(B) -b@r ‘3du; dual agreement marker’ goes back to Proto-Ndu ∗ b@d (cf. Abelam bét, Wosera
ber (also see Laycock 1965: 152), Gala b@l; Iatmul b1t (Staalsen and Staalsen 1973), b1k
594     22 Genetic and Areal Relationships(Jendraschek, p.c.), Boiken ple). The second–third person syncretism in dual forms is found
in Iatmul, Manambu, and also in Boiken.
    The morpheme ∗ b@n(e) ‘second person dual’ could be further analysed into ∗ -b@- ‘dual’ and
∗
  -n(e) ‘second person’. Along similar lines, ∗ gun(e) ‘second person plural’ could be analysed
as ∗ -gu- ‘plural’ and ∗ -n(e) ‘second person’. The morpheme -gu ‘plural’ is found in restricted
contexts, in Manambu -Vgw (see §6.1), and also in Wosera -(n)gu, Abelam -gu (Wilson 1980:
46), where it is restricted to kinship nouns.
    This analysis presupposes that number marking is followed by person marking. This is
indeed the case in Ndu, as can be seen from Manambu cross-referencing markers -d@-wun
(-masc.sg-1sg) ‘ﬁrst person singular basic set versatile tense’, or -di-gwur (-pl-2pl) ‘second
person plural basic set versatile tense’ (see further forms in Chapter 3). The morpheme ∗ -b@d
‘third person dual’ can be analysed as consisting of ∗ -be ‘dual’ and -∗ d ‘third person’.
(C) -b@r ‘plural marker with kin terms’ goes back to Proto-Ndu ∗ -bere, attested in Abelam
-béré ‘pluralizer’ (Wilson 1980: 36). This marker also survives in irregular plural marker -mbri
in West Wosera (Wendel 1993: 57–8: all examples are with kin terms).
   It is likely to have developed an additional meaning (D), that of associative plural, when
used with personal names. The development of a reﬂex of ∗ -bere into a marker of associative
plural is attested in Abelam (Wilson 1980: 36). This is analogous to the way Manambu marks
associative non-singular with -b@r (and also consistent with typologically well-attested patterns
of development of associative plural: Moravcsik 2003). In addition, this illustrates another
shared innovation of both Manambu and Ambulas-Wosera.
   This is an example of how the existing cognates can help trace the linguistic history of
several markers, and disentangle the problem of polysemy and homonymy in Manambu from a
historical perspective. In other cases, we are less lucky. The form ata in Manambu corresponds
to ﬁve morphemes:    (i) question word ‘how?’ (near-synonyms: ata ata, at@ta)—see §10.4;
   (ii) manner adverbial demonstrative ‘thus’ used for textual anaphora and cataphora, with
        a near-synonym atawa—see §10.2.2;
  (iii) a marker introducing a speech report—see §19.5;
  (iv) connective ‘then, and then’—see §19.6; and
   (v) negator for purposives and desideratives—see §14.3.2.","[619, 620, 621]"
