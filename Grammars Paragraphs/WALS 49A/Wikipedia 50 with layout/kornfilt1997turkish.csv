"1. 16. 7.      Others1. 16. 7. 1.     AdverbsMost adverbs in Turkish are not formally distinguished from adjectives;
almost any adjective can be used adverbially. However, there are certain
types of words that are clearly marked as adverbs. These are adverbs
derived from adjectives or nouns by the suffixes -cA or -cAsInA or from
verbs by suffixes like -(y)ArAk, -(y)IncA). Thus, any word carrying one
of these suffixes is an adverb. Some examples follow:(749)          Hasan yava§ -~a yi.ir -ur
               Hasan slow -Iy walk -Aor.
               ""Hasan walks slowly""(750)          Hasan iste -mi       -yerek otur -du
               Hasan want -Neg. -Iy        sit   -Past
               ""Hasan sat down without wanting to""
               (""Hasan sat down not-wantingly"")

                 phrases2. 1. 1. 1. 1.     Bound affixes  Bound affixes, more specifically case suffixes, are the most productive
  way to express syntactic functions of noun phrases. Traditional Turkish
  grammarians (e.g. Gencan (1971» of Turkish recognize five cases: the
  nominative (sometimes also called the absolute) for subjects, the
  accusative (sometimes also called objective) for direct objects (including
  derived causative direct objects which are original subjects of intransitive
. verbs), the dative for indirect objects (including derived causative
  indirect objects of transitive verbs), for benefactives, and for directional
  arguments with the semantic functions of goal, the locative for locational
  arguments, and the ablative for directional arguments with the semantic
  function of source, of object of comparison, or for partitive semantics. A
  number of grammarians also recognize the genitive as a case for subjects
  of nominalized clauses, in addition to being a means for expressing the
  function of a noun phrase as possessor in possessive noun·phrases. The
  suffixes in question are as follows:(751)          Nominative / absolute     -039
               Accusative / objective    -(y)I
               Dative                    -(y)A

             ""Ahmet knows that Ali will give the newspaper to Oya in the office
             and (that) you will go from work to the concert""The first noun phrase, Ahmet, is the subject of the superordinate, fully
finite, clause and is therefore in the nominative case. Ali is the subject of
the nominalized subordinate clause and is thus marked for genitive case.
Gazete is the direct object of the transitive verb ver- 'give' in the first
conjunct of the subordinate coordinate structure and is therefore marked
for accusative case. Oya is the indirect object of the same verb and is
therefore marked for dative case. Buro 'office' is a locative object in that
same conjunct and is thus marked for locative case. In the second
conjunct, i~ 'work' is a directional object that denotes 'source of action or
motion' and is therefore marked for ablative case, while konser 'concert'
is the ""target of motion"" and is thus marked for dative case. The whole
subordinate coordinate structure is the direct object of the verb bil
'know'; as a nominalized clause, it must bear case, just like any argument
which is a simple noun phrase; hence, the subordinate clause exhibits
accusative case marking.","[243, 244, 245]"
"1. 1. 2. 2. 1.     Marking and position of noun clausesAs mentioned in section 1. 1. 2. 1., noun clauses are marked by
""nominalization"" markers as well as ""nominal"" agreement and case
markers. The latter will be those appropriate to the thematic role and
grammatical relation of the subordinate clause with respect to the verb
of the main clause and will be the same as the case markers found on
simple noun phrases in the same position and with the same thematic
role.",[81]
"2. 1. 2. 1. 20. 1. 3.     Different uses of the casesThere are no differences in the use of the individual cases with pronouns
and with nouns.
                                                          Morphology     3012. 1. 2. 1. 20. 1. 4.   Different markers for the casesThe markers for the cases are the same for pronouns and for nouns in
general. However, there are some differences in the case marking
assigned by certain postpositions, depending on whether the
postpositional object is a pronoun or a full noun. The postpositions gibi
'like', kadar 'as much as', ile and its cliticized counterpart -(y)lA 'with',
and i~in 'for' take bare objects in general, but assign the genitive to
pronominal objects--more specifically, to pronominal objects that are
either personal pronouns, demonstrative pronouns or the interrogative
kim; e.g.(1083) a     bu    kitab -1     Ahmet iQn al -dl -Ill
             this book -Ace. Ahmet for buy -Past -l.sg.
             ""I bought this book for Ahmet""(1083) b. bu    kitab -1     on -un    i~ al -dl -Ill
          this book -Acc. he -Geo. for buy -Past -l.sg.
          ""I bought this book for him""Furthermore, there is another group of postpositions on whose objects
the same alternation between genitive case marking and no case marking
is observed, again according to whether the postpositional object is a
pronoun or a full noun:(1084) a.    Ahmet yiiz         -00    -den ge~ kal -dl -Ill
             Ahmet because -3.sg. -Abl. late stay -Past -l.sg.
             ""I was late because of Ahmet""(1084) b. on -un       yiiz     -fin  -den ge~ kal -dl -Ill
          he -Geo. because -3.sg. -Abl. late stay -Past -l.sg.
          ""I was late because of him""The most generally used postpositions in this group are: hakkmda
'concerning', taraflndan 'by, through the agency of', and yiiziinden
'because of'. They differ from the postpositions in the previous group in
two respects: 1. they are used only in one particular case, i.e. 'because' is
used only in the ablative, 'concerning' is used only in the locative, while
other postpositions can be used with any of the cases required by the
syntactic context; 2. these postpositions are inflected with possessive
agreement suffixes that alternate with the person and number of their
postpositional object, thus behaving like possessed nouns rather than
like regular postpositions.
302      Morphology2. 1. 2. 1. 20. 1. 5.   Irregular forms of casesThe markers of some cases are slightly different when used with
pronouns. These differences are mentioned in conjunction with the table
in 2. 1. 2. 1. 1.: the genitive suffix for the first person singular and plural
pronouns is -(I)m instead of the regular -(I)n. In this context, a change in
the stem of pronouns when marked for case should be mentioned: the
first and second person singular pronouns ben and sen. undergo a vowel
change when marked for the dative case: ban-a and san-a, respectively.
Further, the third person pronoun o(n) loses its final consonant in word
final position, i.e. in the nominative case, which has no suffix. The final
consonant shows up before all other cases, which are overtly expressed
by suffixes, and it also shows up before the plural suffix -lar in the third
person plural form on-lar 'they' in all cases.","[332, 333, 334]"
"Furthermore, there is the particle ki(n), which derives possessive
pronouns from nouns as well as pronouns, when either type is marked
for genitive case (as well as deriving possessive pronouns in the
extended sense, when a noun or pronoun is marked for the locative):(1095)   a.   profesor -un      -ki
              professor -Gen. -Rel.el
              ""the one belonging to the professor""(1095)   b. oda    -da -ki
            room -Loc. -Rel.el
            ""the one in the room""(1096)   a.   ben -im      -ki
              I     -Gen. -Rel.eL
              ""the one belonging to me; mine""(1096)   b. on -un      -ki
            he -Gen. -Rel.el
            ""the one belonging to him; his""As examples (1095) and (1096)b illustrate, the particle ki(n) does not
undergo Vowel Harmony; however, there are two nouns after which it
does behave in a regular fashion in undergoing Vowel Harmony: dUn
'yesterday' and gUn 'day':(1097)        dun        -kii
              yesterday -Rel.el
              ""yesterday's; the one pertaining to yesterday""This suffix can attach freely to inflected nouns; thus it can be suffixed to
nouns bearing plural and / or possessive suffixes:
308      Morphology
(1098)      arkada~  -lar -lffi    -m     -ki
            friend   -pI. -l.sg. -Gen. -Rel.e!
            ""my friends'; the one belonging to my friends""It should be noted, however, that ki(n) can attach only to nouns bearing
either the genitive or the locative; it cannot follow other case markers;
but it can precede any case marker:(1099)      profesor -un      -kin     -den
            professor -Gen. -Rel.e! -Abl.
            ""from the one belonging to the professor; from the professor's""A list illustrating all of the cases follows:(1100)      Nominative         profesor -un -ki
            Accusative         profesor -un -kin-i
            Dative             profesor -un -kin-e
            Genitive           profesor -un -kin-in
            Locative           profesor -un -kin-de
            Ablative           profesor -un -kin -denThe same suffix can also attach to adverbs of time or place, also deriving
a pronoun:(1101)      ~imdi-ki
            now -Rel.e!
            ""the one pertaining to now; the present moment's""Note that the final n of this suffix is similar to the one of the third person
singular pronoun o(n) in that it is omitted in word final position; it
surfaces before case suffixes, as shown in (1100), but it drops before the
plural suffix, thus behaving differently from the third person singular
pronoun:(1102) a.   ben -lffi    -kin      -in
            I     -l.sg. -Rel.e! -Gen.
            ""belonging to mine; of mine""(1102) b. ben -im      -ki      -ler-in
          I     -Gen. -Rel.e! -pI. -Gen.
          ""belonging to mine (pl.); of those that are mine""2. 1. 2. 4. 2-3.   Distinctions made between types of possessionsNo distinctions between types of possession (e.g. alienable/inalienable,
temporary / permanent, persons / animals / things, present / past) are
                                                               Morphology            309expressed by the possessive pronouns discussed in the previous
subsection.","[339, 340, 341]"
"2. 1. 2. 4. 4.     Case marking on possessive pronounsAs discussed and illustrated in subsection 2. 1. 2. 4. I., possessive
pronouns formed with the particle ki(n) can be marked for all of the
cases found in the language. Possessive pronouns formed with attaching
the genitive case to a personal pronoun cannot take further case suffixes.",[341]
"2. 1. 1. 3.     Nonfinite or nominalized verbsMorphological marking of noun phrases is essentially the same for finite
and for nominalized verbs. This is true even for accusative marking of
the direct objects of nominalized verbs, which might be surprising,
considering that in many languages, nominalized verbs lose their ability
to mark their direct object for accusative case. The differences between
finite and nonfinite verbs in terms of expressing syntactic functions are
as follows:1. The subjects of fully finite clauses are in the nominative case, while
the subjects of nonfinite or nominalized verbs are in the genitive case (cf.
2. 1. 1. 1. 1. and 2. 1. 1. 2.). The few exceptions to the latter generalization
are found with the subjects of certain nonfinite adverbial clauses whose
subjects are not marked for any case (and hence could be said to be in
the nominative case). For discussion and examples for this last point, the
reader is referred to section 1. 1.2.4. on adverb clauses.",[257]
"2. 1. 1. 1. 5.   Word orderWord order does not express the syntactic and semantic functions of
noun phrases in general. As we saw in sections 1. 11., 1. 12., and 1. 14.,
word order in Turkish is dictated by discourse considerations. However,
there are some instances where word order does interact with the
syntactic and semantic functions of the noun phrase, albeit indirectly.
This happens when a noun phrase is non-specific and therefore cannot
be suffixed with the accusative case marker when it is a direct object;
similarly, a non-specific noun phrase cannot bear a genitive case suffix
when it is the subject of an embedded nominalized clause. In both
instances, these ""bare"" noun phrases must be immediately pre-verbal
216     Morphologyand cannot be moved away from that position. It should be noted that
the same relationship between non-specificity and restriction on
positioning holds also of subjects of main clauses, as well. No case suffix
is being omitted in this instance, however, since nominative case is not
expressed overtly in any event. Examples of each type follow:Non-specific subject of finite clause (otherwise in the nominative case):
(760)        koy     -u haydut -lar bas -mI~
             village -Acc. robber -pI. raid -Rep.Past
             ""Robbers are said to have raided the village""Non-specific direct object (otherwise in the accusative case):
(761)        Hasan <;ocug -un -a          her alq;am       bir hikaye oku-r
             Hasan child -3.sg. -Dat. each evening a           story  read-Aor.
             ""Hasan reads a story to his child every evening""Non-specific subject of nominalized clause (otherwise in the genitive
case):
(762)        [ koy     -u haydut bas -bg                -m] -1 duy -du -m
               village -Acc. rcbber raid -FNom -3.sg. -Ace. hear-Past-1.sg.
             ""I heard that robbers raided the villiage""We might then say that a noun phrase without overt case marking in
immediate pre-verbal position is either a subject or a direct object, if it is
non-specific. The syntactic context and the semantics of the utterance are
going to determine which one of these possibilities is realized.","[247, 248]"
"2. 1. 1. 2. 9.      Complement of copular constructionThe complements of copular constructions directly precede the copula, if
the copula is expressed overtly. Otherwise, such complements are
simply placed at the end of the sentence, thus behaving as any predicate
in this verb-final language. For detailed discussion and examples, the
reader is referred to section 1. 2. 1. 1., and in particular to subsection 1. 2.

complement of 01 surfaces in its bare form, like the complement of the
regular copula; i.e. such complements have no case marking, nor are
they followed by any postposition:(786)            Hasan subay 01          -du

expressed in two distinct ways in Turkish. The first one would be by
simply using the verb 01 'become', illustrated in the previous subsection:(787)        (ben) dekan 01       -du-m
              I     dean become -Past -l.sg.
             ""I became/have become dean""The second construction involves using abstract nouns as complements,
marked with the dative case suffix, and the passive form of the verb ata
'appoint':(788)        (ben) dekan -IJS        -a     ata      -n      -dl-m

like the English 'we made him king' can be productively expressed in
Turkish via two distinct ways. The simpler construction involves the
verb yap 'do', with the complement in its bare form:(789)        ben -i     dekan yap -h  -lar
             I    -Acc. dean do -Past -3.pl.
             ""They made me dean""The second pattern involves the abstract noun construction we saw in
the previous subsection, with the active form of the verb ata 'to appoint'
and the abstract noun in the dative case:(790)        ben -i     dekan -l~        -a   ata       -dl   -lar
             I    -Acc. dean -Abs.N. -Oat. appoint -Past -3.pl.

             ""Hasan is sure of his spouse""It appears that some adjectives assign case to their objects. This is always
an oblique case (as the dative and ablative in the examples above);
adjectives cannot assign accusative. For example, an adjective that might
be expected to assign . accusative case (due to its morphological
relationship to a transitive verb) is kIskan~ 'jealous, envious', related to
the transitive verb laskan 'to envy':(794)        Hasan Ali -yi      kIskan -Ir
             Hasan Ali -Ace. envy      -Aor.
             ""Hasan envies Ali""Notice that this verb is transitive; it assigns accusative case to its direct
object. The related adjective is not transitive in the same sense; it cannot
assign accusative case (nor any other case):(795)        *Hasan Ali -yi     kiskanc; -hr

                  constructionsImpersonal constructions cannot have agents in Turkish. Agents in
passive constructions are marked in two different ways. They are either
followed by the postposition tarafmdan, which is inflected for person
and number and bears ablative case marking, or they are marked with
the suffix -CA, which derives adverbs. For examples, the reader is
referred to subsections 2. 1. 1. 1. 4. and 2. 1. 1. 1. 6., respectively.","[254, 255, 256]"

main singular-plural opposition. The dual is borrowed and survives in
only three obsolete lexical items. Categories like trial and paucal are not
expressed.","[296, 297]"
"1. 1. 2. 2. 6. 5.   Inserted morphological materialOther than the Genitive case and the nominalization morphemes
themselves, no morphological material is inserted into nonfinite clauses.
In this respect, Turkish differs from languages like English, where
prepositions like of (as in: the conquest of Rome) are inserted before
arguments, especially before direct objects. In Turkish, the original case
markers on the arguments found in finite clauses are retained in the
corresponding nonfinite clauses; this is true even for the Accusative case;
e.g.",[88]
"2. 1. 2. 2. 4. 2.     Detai]s of differences between case on reflexives versus
                      case on pronounsWe saw in subsections 2. 1. 2. 1. 20. 1. 4. and 2. 1. 2. 1. 20. 1. 5. as well as
in the table in subsection 2. 1. 2. 1. 1. that first person singular and plural
pronouns have irregular genitive forms, and that pronouns that are the
objects of certain postpositions carry the genitive case, as opposed to
lexical nouns that are not marked for case in the same context. Reflexives
behave like lexical nouns in both respects. The next set of examples show
a reflexive as a postpositional object, in contrast to a noun phrase headed
by a lexical noun and to a pronoun:(1086) a.        bu    kitab -1     kendi -m      i~ al   -d1   -m
                 this book -Acc. self      -1.sg. for buy -Past -l.sg.
                 ""I bought this book for myself""(1086) b.        bu    kitab -1     kIz       -1m     i~ al -d1 -m
                 this book -Acc. daughter -l.sg. for buy -Past -l.sg.
                 ""I bought this book for my daughter""(1086) c.        bu    kitab -1     on -un    1~ al -d1 -m
                 this book -Acc. he -Gen. for buy -Past -l.sg.
                 ""I bought this book for him""
304      MorphologyAs for the shape of the genitive suffix, while it is difficult to find fully
grammatical examples of genitive reflexives, these are possible in
restricted contexts. For example, reflexive genitives can function as
predicate nominals, especially if they are marked with ki, a morpheme
which turns a noun or a pronoun it attaches to into a kind of possessive
pronoun (or relative clitic pronoun) when it follows the genitive suffix:(1087)       bu    kitap kendi -ill     -m      -ki                   -dir
             this book self      -l.sg. -Gen. -Poss.Pr. /Rel.Cl.      -Ep.Cop.
             ""This book is the one which is my own""Note that here, the genitive suffix is the regular -(n)In, rather than the
irregular -im. found on first person singular pronouns, even though the
reflexive is a first person singular form.","[335, 336]"
"2. 1. 1. 2. 8.   Other objects governed by verbsIn section 2. 1. 1. 2. 4. we saw some possibilities for cases other than the
accusative being assigned to noun phrases which would correspond to
direct objects in English. In section 2. 1. 1. 1. 1. we saw that cases other
than the accusative are assigned to noun phrases that function as the
indirect object or as directional objects, e.g. the locative case is assigned
to objects designating a location, the ablative case is assigned to objects
expressing the source of a motion, the dative case is assigned to objects
that express the target of a motion. In addition to those, there is the
instrumental ""clitic"", whose status as a case marker is not recognized by
most traditional grammars of Turkish. An example follows:(781)         Hasan pencere -yi    balta-yla    kIr -dl
              Hasan window-Ace. axe -with break-Past
              ""Hasan broke the window with (an) axe""This cliticized instrumental marker has also a counterpart which is a free
morpheme: ilea Thus, the previous example would be as follows when
the free morpheme is used instead:(782)         Hasan pencere -yi    balta He     kIr -dl
              Hasan window-Acc. axe with break-Past
              ""Hasan broke the window with (an) axe""When the free morpheme cliticizes onto the noun phrase, its vowel
becomes a palatal glide after a stem-final vowel, and it drops after a
stem-final consonant. The clitic becomes part of the phonological word
with respect to Vowel Harmony, as illustrated in (781), where the
original front vowel Ie I becomes [al, due to the backness of the
222     Morphologypreceding vowels in the stem. However, the cliticized instrumental is
exceptional with respect to word stress. Turkish has word-final stress in
general, but, as can be seen in (781), stress must precede the
instrumental; in other words, for stress assignment purposes, the
instrumental suffix behaves as though it were outside the domain of the
phonological word.","[253, 254]"

                         marking in relative pronounsThis relative pronoun is not inflected and thus is not marked for number,

                        possessive pronoun and in the nounPossessive pronouns formed with the particle ki(n) are marked for case
with the same suffixes as those used for nouns.",[341]
"Infinitivals used as minor sentences often also exhibit the Yes/No
question particle which is attached at the very end of the utterance,
having the whole sentence in its scope:(744)      erken -den ~          -e     git -mek mi?
           early -Abl. work -Oat. go -Inf. -Q

               what how much strange a          idea
           ""To go to work early? (What a strange idea!)""
           (i.e. ""You are suggesting to go to work early?"")
                                                                  Syntax    209Another minor sentence type is one involving the abilitative form of a
verb, when the subject agreement inflection is omitted and there is no
overt subject:(745)       ne     yap -mall?
            what do -Abil
            ""What to do?"" (""What is there to be done?"" ""What should one do?"")1. 16.       OPERATIONAL DEFINITIONS FOR WORD
             CLASSES1. 16. 1.   NounNouns are words which can receive case suffixes in appropriate contexts,
which can exhibit plural morphology, which (where it is appropriate
semantically) can be preceded by the indefinite article bir, which can
function as objects of postpositions and of verbs and which can exhibit
nominal (i.e. possessive) agreement marking in possessive noun phrases.
(See also section 1. 2. 5. on noun phrases.)1.16.2.     PronounPronouns belong to closed sets of lexical items. There is the set of simple
personal pronouns, the set of demonstrative pronouns, the set of
reflexive pronouns, a special sort of reflexive that functions as a special
anaphoric pronoun, and the set of reciprocal pronouns. Pronouns can act
as proforms for noun phrases, can be the objects of postpositions and
verbs and can take on case morphology. Hence, any word that belongs
to any of the mentioned closed sets of words and exhibits appropriate
syntactic and morphological behavior is a pronoun.","[240, 241]"

EDITORIAL STATEMENT
Until quite recently, work on theoretical linguistics and work on language
description proceeded almost entirely in isolation from one another. Work on
theoretical linguistics, especially in syntax, concentrated primarily on
English, and its results were felt to be inapplicable to those interested in
describing other languages. Work on describing individual languages was
almost deliberately isolationist, with the development of a different frame-
work and terminology for each language or language group, and no feeding
of the achievements of language description into linguistic theory. Within the
last few years, however, a major rapprochement has taken place between
theoretical and descriptive linguistics. In particular, the rise of language
typology and the study of language universals have produced a large number
of theoreticians who require accurate, well-formulated descriptive data from
a wide range of languages, and have shown descriptive linguists that they can
both derive benefit from and contribute to the development of linguistic
theory. Even within generative syntax, long the bastion of linguistic anglo-
centrism, there is an increased interest in the relation between syntactic
theory and a wide range of language types.
     For a really fruitful interaction between theoretical and descriptive
linguistics, it is essential that descriptions of different languages should be
comparable. The Questionnaire of the present series (originally published as
Lingua, vol. 42 (1977), no. 1) provides a framework for the description of a
language that is (a) sufficiently comprehensive to cover the major structures
of any language that are likely to be of theoretical interest; (b) sufficiently
explicit to make cross-language comparisons a feasible undertaking (in
particular, through the detailed numbering key); and (c) sufficiently flexible
to encompass the range of variety that is found in human language. The
volumes that were published in the predecessor to the present series, the
Lingua Descriptive Studies (now available from Routledge), succeeded in
bridging the gap between theory and description: authors include both
theoreticians who are also interested in description and field-workers with an
interest in theory.
                             Editorial statement  The aim of the Descriptive Grammars is thus to provide descriptions of a
wide range of languages according to the format set out in the Questionnaire.
Each language will be covered in a single volume. The first priority of the
series is grammars of languages for which detailed descriptions are not at
present available. However, the series will also encompass descriptions of
better-known languages with the series framework providing more detailed
descriptions of such languages than are currently available (as with the
monographs on West Greenlandic and Kannada).

Preface
Turkish belongs to the Turkic language family and is the largest
langu~ges (in terms of number of speakers) in the Turkic family, and it
accounts for some 40 per cent of the total number of speakers of Turkic
languages. The main geographic locations of Turkic languages are: 1.
Turkey (Turkish), 2. Azerbaidjan, a republic of the former USSR, and
northwestern Iran (mainly Azerbaidjani), 3. the formerly Soviet Central
.:\sia, Kazakhstan and southern Siberia (e.g. Uzbek, Kazakh,
Turkmenian, Kirghiz) and 4. on the Volga (e.g. Tatar). One Turkic
language (Yakut) is spoken in northern Siberia. In addition, there are
substantial Turkic-speaking communities in northwestern China (Uighur
and Kazakh).","[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22]"

                           •
                       passiveThis is the most productive pattern of the passive constructions found in
Turkish.(1139) a. Kristof      Kolomb     Amerika-yt   ke~f   -et -ti
          Christopher Columbus America-Ace. discovery -do -Past
          ""Christopher Columbus discovered America""(1139) b. Amerika       (Kristof     Kolomb      taraf -In   -dan)
          America        Christopher Columbus side -3.sg. -Abl.
                ke~f      -ed -il     -di
                discovery -do -Pass. -Past
              ""America was discovered (by Christopher Columbus)""The direct object of the verb, marked with the accusative case suffix in
(1139)a, is the nominative-marked subject in (1139)b; note also the
passive suffix on the verb in the latter example (main form -11; after
vowels or 1, the same as the reflexive). The agent is optionally expressed
in the passive construction via a postpostional phrase, as illustrated
above.
324     Morphology2. 1. 3. 1. 1. 1. 2-3.     Indirect object or some other constituent of the
                           active appearing as subject of the passiveThe indirect object (or some other constituent) of the active does not
appear as the subject of the passive; rather, it remains an indirect object
(or other type of constituent), with the same dative (or other
appropriate) case marking it carries in the active:(1140) a.    Hasan ders -ler -e        ba~la -dl
             Hasan lesson -pI. -Oat. begin -Past
             ""Hasan began the lessons""(1140) b. ders     -ler -e   ba~la -n    -dl
          lesson -pI. -Oat. begin -Pass. -Past
          ""The lessons was begun""The dative noun phrase in the passive example lacks two of the typical
subject properties: it is not in the nominative case, and it does not agree
with the predicate in person and number. Thus, such passives belong in
the category of impersonal passives.","[355, 356]"
"This noun can be used as a postposition, meaning 'despite of, in spite of';
the complement is placed in the dative case:(1679)        Hasan [ ban -a      inat] ~       -e      git-ti
              Hasan   I     -Oat. spite   work -Dat. go -Past
              ""Hasan went to work despite my wishes to the contrary""Other nouns, mostly borrowed, can be used as postpositions when
inflected with possessive agreement suffixes and a case morpheme
which can be of one particular type only in this function:(1680)        hak        'right'is a borrowing from Arabic. It takes the locative case in its use as a
postposition; it then means 'concerning; about':(1681)        hakk -1m      -da
              right -l.sg. -we.
              ""about me; concerning me""(1682)           taraf    'side'is also a borrowing from Arabic. It takes the ablative case in its use as a
postposition; it then means 'by, through the agency of' and typically
heads an agentive phrase in passive constructions:
                                                              Morphology        471(1683)       taraf -lDUZ    -dan
             side -1. pl.   -Abl.
             ""by us""Some of the other similar postpositions are yiiz 'face', with the
corresponding postposition in the ablative, and with the meaning
'because of', and nam 'name', a borrowing from Persian, which is used
with the dative case in its function as a postposition and then means 'in
the way of'. (For more examples, see 2. 1.5. 1.)2. 2. 6. 2. 2.   Deverbal postpositionsCertain deverbal adverbs can be analyzed as postpositions in certain
constructions. One typical formation in this regard .involves the suffix
-(y)A:(1684)       OmI -iim      -de [[ bilgisayar ] di -ye          ] hi~bir ~ey
             life -l.sg. -Loc.       computer     say -MAdv.      no    thing
                gor -me     -di   -m
                see -Neg. -Past -l.sg.
             ""I have never seen anything in the way of a computer""This fonn, in particular with the verb de 'say', is often used instead of the
denominal namma, mentioned in the previous subsection.","[502, 503]"
"106 Clements and Sezer (1982) gives a list of stems that violate Vowel
Harmony and offer an account of such ""disharmony"". They come close to
claiming that Vowel Harmony is not a genuine generalization for stems
in Turkish. I prefer to follow the traditional stance on this matter, i.e. to
claim that Vowel Harmony is productive in Turkish within stems as well
as within words, but that exceptions are much more widely found in
stems than elsewhere.

For all grammatical relations, the appropriate WH-word bears the same
case marker as the corresponding full noun phrase; this is exemplified
for the genitive, accusative and dative below and is true for all cases and
all positions where WH-words are found:Genitive subject of an embedded clause:

"1. 7. 5. 49.     Antecedent: direct object, reciprocal: object of adjectiveThe existence of such relationships depends on the considerations
outlined in subsection 1. 7. 5. 44. It is possible to have constructions such
as the following:(626)          ben [ siz     -i i [birbir -iniz -den i emin]] bi! -Ir -di -m

               ""I used to believe you to be sure of each other""If, in accordance with what was said previously, the noun phrase with
the accusative case marking is viewed as the direct object of the main
clause, then (626) illustrates a direct object, functioning as the antecedent
of a reciprocal object of an adjective. However, if the outer brackets mark
the clause boundaries of a subordinate clause, then the accusative-
marked noun phrase is a subject rather than a direct object. In that case,
direct objects cannot function as antecedents of reciprocal objects of
adjectives.",[200]

thus the possessive inflections are all plural, as well. However, as is the
case elsewhere with third person plural possessives, the third person
singular possessive suffix can be used optionally with third person
plural meaning. The resulting form is birbiri, which can be used instead
ofbirbirleri, with all of the case inflections listed above.",[337]

nouns with possessive suffixes, consists of two subsets: 1. those that can
be used with any possessive suffix and any case (the latter assigned to it
by the verb), and 2. those that can be used only with certain (frozen)
cases, although the possessive suffixes can differ.","[455, 456, 457]"
"The situation is different where elements are concerned which, while
nominal, aren't full nouns. These are elements which have been referred
to as ""action nominal"", ""factive nominal"", and ""infinitival"". Another
productive type that belongs to this group is the nominal which is
formed by attaching -(y)I~ to a verbal stem, thus forming nominals that
express the manner as well as the fact of an action. They all have some
nominal properties, in that they can all be affixed with case morphemes,
their subjects are marked with genitive case, and the agreement suffixes
they bear-if they bear any-are taken from the nominal (rather than
verbal) paradigm. Of these nominals, only the factive nominal, marked
with -DIK (and resembling the English gerund in a number of ways), has
otherwise full sentential syntax (with the exception of the ability of
taking all tense and aspect morphemes). The other types exhibit syntactic
properties some of which are nominal, some sentential. For a full
discussion, see section 1. 1. 2. on subordination, especially 1. 1. 2. 2. 6. 1.
and its subsections. Forms with -(y)I~ are the most noun-like ones among
these.",[482]
"2. 1. 1. 11. 5.      Indication of indefiniteness2. 1. 1. 11. 5. 1.     With nonsingular nounsNonsingular nouns can be marked for indefiniteness within their noun
phrase via indefinite quantifiers like bazl 'some':(1017)       bazl elma -lar
             some apple -pI.
             ""some apples""Further, as indicated in 2. 1. 1. 11. 1. (and to be further discussed in
2. 1. 1. 12.), non-specific noun phrases (singular as well as non-singular)
cannot be marked overtly for accusative and genitive case, where the
noun phrase is a direct object or a subject of a nominalized clause,
respectively. Since non-specific noun phrases are indefinite, this is a way
of marking indefiniteness in non-singular noun phrases, as well:(1018)       dun       ~k     garlp     kitap -lar oku -du -m
             yesterday very strange book -pI. read -Past -l.sg.
             ""Yesterday I read very strange books""Note that the direct object noun phrase is lacking accusative case and is
therefore interpreted as non-specific and therefore also as indefinite.
Had the same noun phrase been marked for overt accusative in the same
syntactic position and with the same grammatical relation, it would be
interpreted as definite (and specific):(1019)       dun       ~k     garlp    kitap -lar -I   oku -du -m
             yesterday very strange book -pI. -Acc. read -Past -l.sg.
             ""Yesterday I read the very strange books""Without a determiner and with the accusative marker, the interpretation
of this noun phrase has to be definite. However, if an indefinite
determiner like bazl 'some' shows up in such a syntactic context, the
interpretation is indefinite. In that case, the accusative marking on the
head noun will mark the noun phrase as specific, while the indefinite
determiner will mark it as indefinite:

by all speakers. For many speakers, the author of this book included,
marking for specificity and marking for indefiniteness can successfully
co-occur only to the extent that specificity is expressed clearly, via
modification (e.g. by relative clauses):(1021)       dun         sen -in       tavsiye et -tig   -in     bazl

of a reflexive object of an adjective. However, if the outer brackets mark

marked noun phrase is a subject rather than a direct object. In that case,
direct objects cannot function as antecedents of reflexive objects of

"However, it should also be noted that some of these group 2

accusative or the genitive case can be marked. In such contexts, the
marking for referentiality (Le. the case morphology) is obligatory, since if
that marking does not occur, the reading will be one of nonreferentiality.
However, in other syntactic contexts, Le. where either nominative or
oblique case is assigned, the distinction in question is not marked
morphologically: the nominative is never marked morphologically
(irrespective of referentiality), and oblique cases are always marked
overtly, again irrespective of referentiality.","[310, 311]"

nominative case when they are the subjects of a fully finite, tensed
clause, and they are usually in the genitive case, when they are the
subjects of a nominalized subordinate clause (cf. 2. 1. 1. 1. 1.). Example
(752) illustrates the nominative subject of a transitive verb, the genitive
subject of a transitive verb and the genitive subject of an intransitive
verb. Nominative case is not marked overtly in Turkish. The genitive is
marked via a suffix: -(n)In for third person, -(I)m for first person, and
-(I)n for second person. Thus, the genitive is unusual among all case
suffixes in changing its shape for different person features of the noun it
attaches to. The subject of certain adverbial nominalized clauses bearing
the factive nominalization marker is unusual in that it carries no case
suffix at all (cf. 1. 2. 1. 3. 1. 4.).",[249]
"1. 2. 2.      A djecti.ve phrases1. 2. 2. 1.      Operational definition of adjective phrasesLet us define an adjective phrase as any string which ends in an
adjective. The problem of using this definition as a generally valid
operational definition in Turkish lies in the difficulty of drawing a clear
distinction between adjectives- and nouns. Most adjectives can also be
used as nouns, i.e. they can occur in typical nominal contexts: they admit
affixation with plural and case suffixes as well as nominal (possessive)
agreement suffixes, and the indefinite article bir 'a' can precede them:(371)            ya~h   'old'
                 ya~h -lar -a
                 old -pI. -Dat.     ""to the old ones""(372)            hast a 'sick'
                 bir hasta
                 a     sick         ""a sick person, a patient""Lewis (1975) states that the only large class of adjectives which are not
used as nouns are those formed with the Turkish derivational suffixes
-sI, -(I)msI, -(I)mtrak, and -(s)Al, the Arabic -1, and the Persian -ane and
-van (all of those suffixes by which adjectives are derived), as well as
recent borrowings from European languages like demokratik and
kiiltiirel. Thus, a constituent ending (within an unmarked word order)
with a word clearly marked morphologically as an adjective is an
adjective phrase.",[125]

              ""Hasan works well""Nouns can also be used as adverbs, but this is much more restricted than
adjectives used in this way. When used adverbially, nouns are usually in
the nominative case, and they function as temporal, locational or
measure adverbials:(364)            ev   -1m     iiniversite-den iki mil ate -de -dir

                 ""My house is two miles away from the university""There are some foreign adverbs; these are formed from Arabic nouns
with the Arabic suffix -en. Since this suffix is exceptional in rejecting
word stress, the word stress is never final in these adverbs, but rather is
always on the penultimate syllable:

adjectives or nouns by the suffix -C A. This suffix derives manner
adverbs from adjectives, and a variety of adverbial types from nouns:(366)        Hasan gomleg -i       iyi -ce yIka -dl

             ""Hasan plays the piano like Rubinstein""(370)        Hasan opera -ya [ saat be~ -ten once ] git           -ti
             Hasan opera -Dat. hour five -Abl. before go          -Past
             ""Hasan went to the opera before five 0' clock""1. 2. 1. 3. 1. 3.   Cases of noun phrasesThere are no cases specific to noun phrases used adverbially. However,
noun phrases discussed in subsection 1.2. 1.2.4. as ""other"" arguments of
verbs, i.e. noun phrases that are neither subjects, direct objects, nor
indirect objects, and are marked with the instrumental/ comitative, the
ablative / partitive, the locative, and the directional dative can be viewed
as adverbial, cased noun phrases.","[123, 124]"
"Furthermore, given that subject pronouns can be dropped quite freely in
Turkish, it is also possible to omit the overt plural subject in these
constructions and have the same ambiguity; this is not a surprising
possibility, because that all relevant features of subject pronouns are
expressed in the agreement suffix of the predicate:(1078)       Ahmet -Ie      diin       Slnema -ya git -ti    -k
             Ahmet -with yesterday cinema -Dat. go -Past -l.pI.

             b. ""Yesterday Ahmet and I went to the movies""
                                                             Morphology    2992. 1. 2. 1. 18. 1.   Comitative conjunction constructions with pairs of
                     pronounsThe phenomenon discussed in the previous subsection also occurs with
pairs of pronouns:(1079)       biz sen       -m     -Ie     bu ak§am       Slnema -ya
             we you(sg.) -Gen. -with this evemng cinema -Dat.
               gid -ecek -ti     -k
               go -Fut. -Past -l.pI.
             a ""We were going to go to the movies with you this evening""
             b. ""You and I were going to go to the movies this evening""Again, just as is the case when the element marked with the comitative
conjunction is a full lexical noun phrase, the plural subject pronoun can
be omitted, and the ambiguity in question is preserved:(1080)       sen      -in    -Ie    bu ak§am        sinema -ya
             you(sg.) -Gen. -with this evemng cinema -Dat.
               gid -ecek -ti     -k
               go -Fut. -Past -l.pI.
             a ""We were going to go to the movies with you this evening""
             b. ""You and I were going to go to the movies this evening""Note that as is the case in many instances where a case is assigned by a
postposition instead of a verb, the pronoun which is the object of the
comitative conjunction is marked with the genitive suffix. However,
when a noun phrase with a full lexical head is the object of the same
postposition, it may (or sometimes must) not carry that case. This is so
with -(y)lA, which is a cliticized postposition. It is interesting to note that
when -(y)lA is used as a conjunction rather than as a genuine comitative
postposition, the Genitive is preferably omitted on its pronominal
phonological host:(1081)       sen      -Ie   ben bu ak§am         sinema -ya
             you(sg.) -and I     this evening cmema -Dat.
               gid -ecek -ti     -k
               go -Fut. -Past -l.pI.
             ""You and I were going to go to the movies this evening""The same is true of the comitative conjunction constructions in question:
300      Morphology(1082)       biz sen       -Ie    bu alq;am       sinema -ya
             we you(sg.) -with this everung anema -Dat.
               gid -ecek -ti     -k

             a. ""?We were going to go to the movies with you this evening""
             b. ""You and I were going to go to the movies this evening""It is therefore reasonable to analyze the comitative conjunction
construction as a conjunction construction rather than as a comitative
construction, and the occurrence of the element -(y)lA in these
constructions as a conjunction marker rather than as a comitative
postposition. 512.1.2.1.19.       Secondary pronoun systemTurkish has no secondary pronoun system, by which it would be
possible to specify in greater detail the precise composition of various
nonsingular combinations of persons. Such combinations are expressed
by the ordinary means of coordination.","[330, 331, 332]"
"2. 1. 1. 2. 4.   Direct objectThe direct object bears accusative case marking (i.e. the suffix -(y)I),
unless it is either non-specific or generic and incorporated. In those latter
instances, the direct object bears no overt case marking:(771)    a.   (ben) kitab -1     oku -du -ill
               I      book -Acc. read -Past -1.sg.
              ""I read the book""(771)    b. (ben) bir kitap oku -du -ill
             I      a    book read -Past -l.sg.
            ""I read a book [non-specific]""(771)    c.   (ben) kitap oku -du -ill
               I      book read -Past -1.sg.
              ""I read books [non-specific/ generic]""Some verbs assign oblique cases to their objects. These objects might
correspond to direct objects in English; e.g. the verb nefret et 'hate'
assigns ablative case to its object, the verb bin 'mount, ride' and yardl1ll
et 'help' (among a number of others) assign dative case:(772)         Hasan ben -den nefret ed -er
              Hasan I      -Abl. hate  -Aor.
              ""Hasan hates me""(773)         Hasan at       -a    bin     -er
              Hasan horse -Oat. ride       -Aor.
              ""Hasan rides horses""(774)         Hasan ban -a      yardlm et      -ti
              Hasan I     -Oat. help           -Past
              ""Hasan helped me""Whether a direct object is assigned accusative or oblique case is
determined by the governing verb. Whether a direct object that would
otherwise receive accusative case carries the corresponding suffix or not
is determined by its specificity. (Note, incidentally, that oblique case
220     Morphologysuffixes are always attached, even where the direct object is non-specific;
this is illustrated in example (773).)It is irrelevant for the expression of the direct object function whether the
subject of the clause is expressed as a free or as a bound element or if the
subject remains unexpressed. An example for each of these syntactic
contexts is given:(775)        Hasan kitab -1      oku-du
             Hasan book -Ace. read -Past
             ""Hasan read the book""(776)        kitab -1      oku -du -m

             ""To read this book is very difficult""2. 1. 1. 2. 5.   Indirect objectThe indirect object is expressed by attaching the suffix for dative case to
it:(778)        Hasan kitab -1     Ali -ye ver -di
             Hasan book -Acc. Ali -Oat. gIve -Past
             ""Hasan gave the book to Ali""2. 1. 1. 2. 6.   Object of comparisonThe object of comparison is marked with the ablative case suffix -DAn:(779)        Hasan ben -den (daha) zeki
             Hasan I     -Abl. (more) intelligent
             ""Hasan is more intelligent than I""The object of comparison may also be followed by the comparative
element daha 'more'. This usage has an intensifying effect; the
postposition is optional, however. For detailed discussion of
comparative constructions, the reader is referred to section 1. 8.","[251, 252]"
"2. 1. 2. 6. 1. 1.      Types of interrogative pronouns2. 1. 2. 6. 1. 1. 1.     GeneralTurkish has a number of interrogative pronouns; the most generally

              ka~               'how many'The first four items on this list can bear the plural and possessive
suffixes. The first three can bear all of the case suffixes. The fourth can
take case suffixes only after it has been suffixed with possessive suffixes.
The manner interrogative nasl1 'how' can take the plural suffix only
when used predicatively. Illustrative tables for ne and hangi follow:(1121)                          Singular         Plural

              Ablative          ne-den           ne -ler -denThe fact that the accusative suffix can be omitted is a subcase of the
general phenomenon that the same suffix is omitted when a direct object
is non-specific. Thus, ne and neler is used to ask after non-specific
entities, while neyi and neleri is used to ask after specific entities:

"As this example illustrates, the connective DA cannot follow the Yes/No
question particle, and the latter particle (mI) cannot follow a copula (or
copular sequence); it follows nominals (which may be marked for case),
adjectives, and participles (with verb stems carrying simple tense / aspect
morphology included in the latter). The comitative particle, functioning
as a case marker, must be closest to a nominal stem (and, due to its
function, must attach to the noun without case markers). The adverb
-(y)ken attaches to nouns (which may be marked for case), adjectives and
participles (including simple tensed verbs, but excluding simple verbs
marked with the definite past and the conditional). It cannot follow
copular forms, but must precede them. It also cannot follow the
connective DA, nor can it follow the Yes/No question particle. 97 The
connective DA, in turn, can follow nouns (which may carry case
markers), adjectives and participles, adverbs, and tensed verbs as well as
tensed copular forms. Thus, different attachment sites -can exist for DA:(1536)        Oya Ahmet -Ie           -yken de       kIskan<;-h

its attachment.",[476]

only after being suffixed with possessive suffixes first. The first three

possessive suffixes and thus take on either a selective reading (Le. 'from

interrogatives: ne zaman or ne vakit 'when' ('what time'); ne kadar 'how
much'; ni9n 'why' (from ne i~in 'what for'). The same pronoun can also
form some other interrogatives by taking some inflectional and
derivational markers; e.g. neden 'why' (from ne-den 'what-Abl.'); nece'in
what language' (from ne-ce 'what-ish'); neci 'of what profession' (from
ne-ci. 'what-Prof. ').","[349, 350]"

marker.",[214]
"A class of exceptions to this generalization consist of nominal uses of
participles (typically, in constructions that correspond to free, i.e.
headless, relative clauses in English). This issue is more appropriately
treated in the context of adjectival formations. For discussion and
examples, see 2. 2. 3. 2. and 1. 1. 2. 3. In these forms, the syntax is
predominantly sentential, although some nominal features (e.g. genitive
marking of the subject) is found, as well.
452      Morphology2. 2. 1. 4.    Deriving nouns from adverbsThe suffix -el, which derives nouns denoting habitual or professional
activities from nouns and adjectives, can also be used to derive similar
nouns from certain (usually morphologically nonderived) adverbs:(1574)        c;abuk 'fast'      ~buk-~       'person who does things (perhaps too) fast'There are a number of place expressions which are traditionally
analyzed as adverbs (rather than as nouns); some examples follow:(1575)        ·
              lc;erl        'inside'            dr;;an   'outside'

              kalii l       'opposite'These expressions can be used as nouns, which can be shown by
attaching suffixes to them that are used as nominal inflectional markers,
and by placing them into nominal phrases. Some examples follow:

              ""the inside of the house""These adverbs can be used in their bare form as well as in the locational
cases, i.e. with the suffixes for dative, locative and ablative:(1577)        ic;eri gir    -di                    dr;;an <;tk -h

              ""He stayed inside""                   ""She came from outside""It is customary in the tradition of Turkish works on the grammar of the
language to analyze the bare adverbs as genuine adverbs, but the
suffixed adverbs as nouns. If so, these nominal inflectional suffixes
would have to be analyzed as derivational suffixes, deriving nouns from
adverbs. This consequence of the analysis is made explicit by Ergin
(1985). The same analysis and consequence would carry over to time
adverbials like once 'before' and sonra 'after', which can be affixed by a
sequence of suffixes consisting of the nominal plural suffix and the third
                                                                       Morphology        453person suffix, yielding onceleri 'previously' and sonralarl 'afterwards'.
The locative, dative and ablative cases show up with time adverbials, as
well.","[483, 484, 485]"
"Furthermore, mood cannot be expressed directly in nonfinite clauses,
either, and various periphrastic ways to express such verbal categories
have to be used instead. Since moods like the conditional, optative,
imperative, and debitive are directly expressed as suffixes on the fully
finite verbs, the loss of those categories is very clear. (For examples of
suffixes expressing moods in finite verbs, see section 2. 1.3.).
                                                                  Syntax   551. 1. 2. 2. 6. 2.   Means for making the verb nonfiniteAs illustrated in the previous sections, the verb is made nonfinite by
replacing the tense / aspect and mood markers of the fully finite verb by
a variety of nominalizing markers. The nonfinite forms used in argument
clauses and some type of clauses t_h at have modifier or adverbial status
have such a marker as their word-final suffix; the two nominal forms
that we have seen for argument clauses (with the exception of the
infinitive marker) and one type of participial marker used in relative
clauses are further suffixed by agreement morphemes, marking the
nominalized verb for agreement in person and number with the subject.
These agreement markers are different from corresponding forms used
with fully finite verbs, however; agreement suffixes used with nonfinite
verbs come from a ""nominal"" paradigm and are also used in possessive
noun phrases of the sort 'John's book', to mark the head noun for
agreement with the possessor (which can, in a sense, be regarded as the
subject of the possessive noun phrase). Note also that the subject of a
fully finite clause is in the nominative case, while the subject of a
nonfinite clause (insofar as there is such a subject) is marked with the
genitive suffix.","[86, 87]"
"A few general remarks are in order here, however. As mentioned earlier,
one position the reciprocal pronoun cannot occur in, at least for non-
permissive speakers, is the position of subject. Just as is the case for
reflexive pronouns, even for permissive speakers, the restriction against
reciprocal nominative subjects appears to be stricter than the restriction
against genitive subjects. For non-permissive speakers, the reciprocal
pronoun cannot appear as the genitive-marked possessor in possessive
noun phrases, either. In contrast with the positional possibilities of the
reflexive pronoun, discussed in sections 1. 6. 4. and 1. 6. 5, reciprocal
pronouns are somewhat more acceptable as genitive subjects; this is true
even for less permissive speakers.",[193]
"2. 1. 2. 1. 9.      Special pronouns for the tribal, sectional, or family
                    relationshipsThere are no special pronominal forms indicating the tribal, sectional, or
family relationships of the referents, nor are there such special forms
indicating such relationships of the speaker of hearer to the referents.
Such relationships are expressed by using regular possessive noun
phrases whose possessors are regular personal pronouns in the Genitive
case; the head in such constructions is the referent with a possessive
suffix that agrees in person and number with the possessor:(1055)   a.      (biz -im )     aile     -miz

 either the reading of being a specific book or that of being non-specific.
 In the first instance, it would bear overt accusative marking. In the
 second instance, illustrated in (755), it is not marked for accusative
 overtly and is therefore interpreted as non-specific. Attachment of the
 genitive case suffix (or lack thereof) is discussed further, with examples,
