"V.8.   The parts of speech.
   In the foregoing sections we have mentioned several types of words
with the distinctive names of the traditional parts of speech. These
distinctions are obviously based on structural, morphological and
syntactical, features, characteristic for them, which will be clear enough
from the examples cited. But on some points further explanation and
justification seems necessary. It will be clear, for instance, that the
verb is characterized as such by its flexion; that the noun and the
adjective are distinguished from each other by their different syntactic
positions in word subordination with another noun; the demonstrative
pronoun from the adjective by its similar syntactic position as the
noun’s, and the personal pronoun from the noun by its pseudo-flexion
of “genetive”   (possessive) forms through apophony.          But some doubt
may be justified as for the “adverbs” and the “numerals”.             Notably
the latter allow more than one interpretation.
   The “adverb” has no specific characteristics to distinguish it from
the noun or the adjective. Often nouns can function as adverbial
expressions, e.g., huwe, “evening, afternoon”, but also “in the evening” ;
makaj, “manner, way”, but also “apparently” ; etc. Similarly adjectives
may function as adverbs, e.g., nahinki, “sufficient(ly)”. The syntactic
position of the “adverb” as attribute to the adjective is not different
from that of the adjective to the noun. But many “adverbs” occur
only as such, i.¢., as attributes to adjectives or verbs, and never occur
as adjectives to nouns nor as nouns themselves, e.g., nahi’bi, “promptly,
suddenly, further”; manam, “still, yet”; ba, “only, just’; mo, “id.”;
bamo, “id.” ; bamba, “exceedingly, violently” (bam, “not” + ba, “only,
a little’); mana, “to-day”; wena, “yesterday”; wahena, “tomorrow” ;
etc. Some are apparently formed with a preposed na or na, which may
be none other than the 3"" p.s. pronoun as a possessive or a demon-
strative (cf. III.2.1       and III.3.1),    eg., na-hu’we,   “in the evening,
 evenings”;   na denijaj,    “in the night, of nights” ; and possibly also the
example already mentioned, nahi’bi. Others seem to be distinguished
by repetition, e.g., dala wahawowmi, nahinki-hinkt jejwowmi, “he dealt
out to them goods, sufficiently he gave to them” ; but bele nahinkt bamo,
“that (was) just sufficient”. But in such cases the repetition may
 62                   GRAMMAR     OF THE SENTANI     LANGUAGE represent intensity rather than adverbial quality. Also many “adverbs”
 seem to have an irregular stress, notably final stress even when the
 word ends in a vowel, eg., na-hu’we, “in the evening’, cf. ’huwe,
 “evening”, with normal stress; nahi’bi, “suddenly”; and with both
 irregular final stress and repetition wa’la-wa’la, “quickly”. But, as we
 have seen (III. 2) repetition is found in several adjectives as well; and
 irregular final stress also occurs in other words. Yet the latter seems
to be more frequent in such “adverbs”.
   As to syntactic position in relation with the verb, the relative freedom
of the “adverb” as compared with other attributive word-types is
certainly a specific feature, cf. the examples cited: nahi’bi duwawoke,
“suddenly it sank”; but also dowke nahi’bi, “she took suddenly”. All
evidence taken together, I feel justified in regarding the adverbs as
a separate part of speech, although it must be admitted that its distinc-
tive features are not very pronounced.
   The “numerals” I have included in the adjectives. But a different
interpretation is, for some historically at least, equally possible. The
lower numerals 1-4 are, as far as we can judge at present, independent
words: ambaj, “1”; be, “2”; name, “3”; kali, “4”. They follow the
noun to which they refer and therefore can be classed as adjectives.
But if the construction of noun plus numeral is taken as a subordinative
combination of type (1) in section V. 7 (noun plus noun), these numerals
can also be regarded as nouns, meaning “unit”; “pair”; etc. And
certainly nouns are, historically at least, the higher “numerals” which
appear to be formed with names of parts of the body, eg., mahambaj
(< ma     fe ambaj,   “one   hand-palm’’),   “5”;   mahina   ambaj,   “6”;   which
are derivational and partly derivational partly syntactical respectively
(cf. III. 2.1 and V.6); ma be, “10” (lit. “2 hands”); ma be odo fe
ambaj, “15” (lit. “2 hands, one footsole”); u ambaj, (“one body”) or
odo be ma be (“2 feet, 2 hands”), “20” ; etc., which are fully syntactical.
For the sake of simplicity and unity, however, we do not distinguish
between the various types for our classification as part of speech.","[69, 70]"

    The no.I series, which is probably composed with the emphatic
particle je, contains the stressed absolute forms of the personal pronoun.
The no. IT forms are at the same time the indifferent absolute forms
of the personal pronoun used as subject, the personal forms used with
postpositions, and the possessive forms. In quick speech they may
be abbreviated to d-, w-, etc. before vowel, except for the 1°* p. du., pl.
incl. and excl. No. III is a strongly stressed possessive, also used as
absolute (substantive) possesive (Eng.                 “mine, yours”), and hence as
a kind of reflexive (Eng. “myself, yourself”). It is sometimes abbre-
viated to de, we, etc. The 3"" p, is also used sometimes as a demon-
strative; and this may be the case also for na of the II series, if at
least na, na in the abstract nouns of ITI.2.1 and in certain adverbial
expressions as na-huwe, “in the evening(s)” (cf. huwe, “evening”’) ;
na-denijaj, “in the night(s)” (cf. denijaj, “night’”), and others (cf. V. 8),
must be regarded as demonstrative and not as possessive. The no. IV
series lastly represents a toneless proclitic possessive, which is often,
though    not   necessarily,       abbreviated    to d-,   w-   etc.    before   vowel,   but
which is not a prefix, and is not essentially different from no, II
as possessive. Often the two types may be used for each other, eg.,
da ahamam or da ahamam, “my food”; na falam or na falam, “his7 I have included this “inclusive” form of the 1** p.du., pl., although it is not
  in general use and is probably a dialectal form adapted to this specialized end
  under Austronesian influence. For in the closely related Tanah Merah language
  the unique form for the 1** p.du., pl, both inclusive and exclusive, is ee,
  while it is mi, me in Nafri. Also in the inflected forms of the verb there is
  not a single trace of separate inclusive and exclusive 1** p.du., pl. forms. The
  series II type of this pronoun (e) is put between brackets because I have
  never met it in actual usage, while my informants were divided in their
  opinions on the point.

head”; but often also speech usage assigns the one or the other form
to definite words, eg., wa ma, “thy hand”; na dama, “his tail”; na
ime, “his house”;       na jo, “his village”; na kalu,   “his (brother’s)   son” ;
da u, “my body”; etc., but na fa, “his child” (though na hokolo-fa, “his
younger child”); na a’hanajala, “his rations”; na waku, “his drum” ;
na jam, “its (the house’s) roof”; etc. Neither euphony nor classification
of nouns plays a demonstrable part in this, although, naturally, the
latter may have existed in an earlier phase of the language and may
have had its influence at the time.","[24, 25]"
"V.7.     Subordination of words.
   There are ten types of subordinative combination of words: (1) noun
and nominal attribute (noun); (2) noun and noun in paratactical ap-
position ; (3) noun and nominal attribute (adj ective, including numerals) ;
(4) noun (including gerund) and pronominal attribute ; (5) noun and
verbal attribute; (6) adjective and adverbial attribute; (7) adverb and
adverbial attribute; (8) verb and adverbial attribute; (9) verb and object
or goal; and (10) combination of types (1) and (4) to form possessive
phrases.
   In type (1) the attribute precedes the head, and the function is that
of a generalized relation of possession or origin. We have already briefly
mentioned this type in III.2.2 on borderline cases; e.g., aka’la obo,
 “jungle (i.e. wild) pig”; joku falam, “dog’s head” ; ondofolo fa, “chief’s
 child” ; ondofolo i’fa, “‘chief’s canoe” ; etc. The attribute may be accom-
 panied by the postposition le ~ de, “with”, to indicate a possessive
 relation in the sense of “having something on or with one”. The
 attribute in this case is itself a (postpositional) phrase, e.g., ondofolo
 le fola, “the chief’s bow-and-arrow”          (that he has with him); Dasim
 58                   GRAMMAR    OF THE SENTANI     LANGUAGE Kalawbew de omi, “D.K.’s daughter” (whom he has with him) ; ne-waw
 de joku, “his uncle’s dog”; joku le falam, “the dog’s head” ; etc.
      In type (2) the apposition follows the head, a slight pause intervening,
 eg., ney jo da awojde        Hubulew    Jawbe-jo    da Abala     Jakali nej —
 a bala-jo — da; “they both went to their own villages, H. to Jawbe
 village (and) Jakali of Sbala to his — the Obalo village’; Ajokoj
 — Dasim Kalawbew de omi — ake kolukawna, “A. — D.K.’s daugh-
ter —     went (and) held him”; etc.
      The adjective (and the numeral)     of type (3) follows the head, eg.,
ime kabam, “big house”; do hokolo, “young man”; mije nale, “old
woman” ; fa hokolo, “young child” (as distinct from the composite form
hokolo-fa, “the younger or youngest child of a family”; cf. III. 2.1);
fa bana, “an older child” (as distinct from bana-fa, “elder, eldest child’’) ;
ja ambaj, “one day, a certain day” ; hokolo be, “the two young (ones)” ;
do name, “four men’ etc.
   If the noun is accompanied by a pronominal attribute, demonstrative,
interrogative, or possessive (type 4), the latter precedes the head, e.g.,
bele do, “that man”; daka ime, “this house”; dika no, “yonder tree
(trunk)”; na falam, “his head”; na dama, “its tail”; da ime, “my
house”; da or da ahamam, “my food”; nej jo, “his (own) village” ;
dej ime, “my (own) house”; na ma, “his hand”; nej ma na, “on their
hand” (i.e. “at their expense instead of his own”); wej mej, “your due” ;
hina mej, “whose due?”’; maka mej, “due for what, for what end?”;
n-aj-aj (contracted from na or na ajaj),            “his going”   (gerund);   na
bej-bej, “his seeking, the seeking of him”; n-ajdi n-oj-oj, “its going
up (and) its falling down”; etc. The attribute may be accompanied by
the postposition Je ~ de, “with”, as possessive, e.g., hina le ime, “whose
house ?”; etc.
  Type (5) consists of a noun followed by a finite verb form which,
however, has not finite, but participial or relative, function, eg., dois, moreover, restricted to standing expressions like the one mentioned,
is really only functionally subordinated (as from our point of view),
but structurally it is not essentially different from the serially coordina-
tive type of construction of phrases mentioned in V. 6.1, 374 para.
    The adverb which determines an adjective (type 6) follows it, eg.,
foj sala, “very good” (s for h after j); hele najkaj sala, “a very loud
shouting” ; mahs-mahe bamo, “only some, only a few”; do ambaj fam,
“even one man”; do halan nam, “so many men” for *halam +
fam ~ ham); etc.

  If the adverb determines another adverb        (type 7), it has the same
position, eg., wala wala hala,       “very quickly”;   foj moj sala, “very
exceedingly good” ; etc.
   As attribute of a verb the adverb (type 8) may either precede or
follow the verb, the former position being favoured, notably (but not
exclusively) when the adverb is stressed, e.g., nahi’bi duwawoke,
“promptly it sank”; wala-wala jadonko, “quickly fetch” ; wahena daje
kulum udale, “to-morrow I shall pack up”; banam dilowfoke, “again
he dived”: nawa dowke, “you’ve got it indeed, all right”; but also:
duwke mo fam, “it only just fell, started falling” ; w-om Jakali dowke
nahi’bi neji molo da, “thy daughter has suddenly taken J. for her
husband” ; nabe u nabe wa jewboke ama-foma, “it was restored entirely
in its original condition” ; etc.
   If the verb has an object for attribute (type 9), the latter as a rule
precedes the former, e.g., fi ukake, “he beat the sago”; dejmaj koma,
“let us make a feast”; na kada-nala awsajawboke, “he squandered his
possessions”;   i fownanake,   “he    jabbed   fire at him’;   na   kada-nala
wahewmikoke, “he divided their goods to them”; aka mije jawaw-
nohonde, “thou wilt accompany thy elder brother’s wife”; etc. But
for reasons of emphasis the order is sometimes reversed, e.g., wala-wala
jadonko malo, “quickly bring here clothes”; adajnobo gha!, “lodk at
the thing!” ; etc.
   The object may be qualified or stressed by a postposition, in which
case the attribute is itself a two word phrase of the postpositional
type (V. 5). Postpositions are the rule, of course, for an indirect object
or, with intransitive verbs denoting a movement, for the direction. But
just as in the forementioned examples the incorporated object affixes
referred both to the direct object (aka mije jawawnohonde) and to the
indirect object (¢ fownanake and kada-nala wahewmikoke), a post-
position may refer to a direct or an indirect object. The use and the
choice of postpositions with the object depends on the nature of the
action expressed in the verb. In so-called intransitive verbs as a-, “go”,
etc., a postposition indicates the direction of the movement, eg., jo da
ake, “he went to the village’; ime da owoke, “he descended from the
house” ; etc. Similarly in Dajma da wawna, “he-said-to-him to Dajmo”,
Dajmo is the indirect object with the postposition da to the verb wa-,
“say to, tell”, which is at the same time inflected for this same indirect
object by the person object affix -na. And the same situation is found
in Hijako da huwawnokoke, “she related (it all) to H.”. But in joku
na foke hoje, “a dog thou wentst kill”, and in ko na anke anke, “he
 60                 GRAMMAR   OF THE SENTANI       LANGUAGE had eaten coconuts”, it is the direct object, which is accompanied by
 the postposition na, “in”.
    Type (10) lastly, contains two subtypes: (a) one in which the com-
 bination consists of a single noun as head preceded by a two-word
 phrase of type (1) or (4), with a noun, interrogative pronoun, or the
 emphatic possessive,   plus mej,    “due”,   as attribute;   and   (b) one in
which the combination consists of a single noun as attribute, followed
by a two-word phrase of type (4), with the normal possessive of the
3 p. na    na plus another noun, as head. The first subtype denotes
a relation, possessive or other, in which the head is the due of, is the
thing destined or meant for, the attribute, eg., Nakahabo mej ko,
“the Lobster’s coconut (his due, his part)”; hina mej habakaj, “whose
tobacco (due to whom) ?”; we7 mej ime, “thy house (meant for thee)” ;
nej mej kada-nala, “goods due to them’; etc. The second subtype
denotes a specialized relation of origin or possession, as distinct from
the generalized relation of type (1); eg., joku na falam, “the head of
the dog”, as distinct from joku falam, “dog’s head”; Dajma na joku,
“D.’s dog”; am oloku na fe, “oloku-banana leaf”, as distinct from am
fe, “banana leaf” (generally); ondofolo na fa, “the chief’s child”, as
distinct from ondofolo fa, “a chief’s child” ; Dasim n-omi, “D’s daugh-
ter” ; ondofolo na fala, “the bow-and-arrow of the chief” ; etc.","[65, 66, 67, 68]"
"   The Sentani verbal system is extremely complicated. A verbal form
consists of one or two verbal roots to which may be added affixes for
person (including number) both for the subject and the object (direct
or indirect), mood, tense and aspect. The only prefix in use is the
negative a-. These facts, together with the frequent contraction of
affixes, justify the analysis of the verbal structure on the basis of root
plus affixes only, without making distinction between suffixes and
infixes, and without introducing the notions of “stem” and of “imme-
diate constituents” which would in most cases hardly be a simplification.
   Structurally three principal types of verbal forms can be distinguished :
(1)         primary forms, which are formed without an aspectual affix;
(2)         secondary forms, which contain an aspectual affix; and
(3)         composite forms, which contain two verbal roots.
     In the last category two types can be distinguished:
(a)   the two roots are different, the first of them indicating a move-
ment and each being inflected differently, in which case the compound
denotes a sequence of events ;
(b) the two roots are the same; this is the case of repetition of root
forms indicating the gerund.
                                         MORPHOLOGY                                                19
   An apparent third possibility of composition of similar roots in
inflected forms other than that mentioned in (b), is really that of a
verbal root indicating movement, which takes what seems to be origi-
nally a bound variant of the same root as an aspectual affix and
thereby stresses the direction of that same movement (see IIT. 4. 4. 1).
This belongs, therefore, in the category of secondary forms of (2) supra.
   Repetition of fully and independently inflected verb forms is syn-
tactical and does not belong in this chapter (see III. 2.2 and V. 6).
   In the categories of non-composite, i.e., primary and secondary,
forms alone, a simple calculation will show that the number of theore-
tically possible verbal forms, including all moods, tenses and aspects,
and including both forms with and without object affixes, amounts to
more than 4,000, of which the indicative alone accounts for some 2,500.
Naturally these possibilities do not all occur for every single verb, and
some have similar forms for dual and plural object affixes. But the
calculation shows clearly enough that the actually possible forms do
number some thousands.
   The following table gives a schematic conspectus of the verbal system
as far as non-composite forms are concerned:

III. 4.1.   The   verbal   root.","[26, 27, 28]"
"   With regard both to repetition and to composition there are cases
which may cause doubt as to whether they are derivational or rather
flexional, on the one hand, and whether they are at all morphological
or rather syntactical, on the other. To a large degree this may be due
to the very strong tendency of the language to phrase sandhi, whence
both morphological and syntactical constructions are close units, pho-
netically, while both stress and meaning are not always decisive. Hence
the basic criteria for morphological composition and repetition, as
distinct from syntactical, to be regarded as forming single words,
 sometimes fail us. Thus jobo, “tame pig”, is clearly composed,                     and
 therefore a morphological construction, both because of its contracted
 form, its stress and its specific meaning            (‘jo ‘obo would mean          “the
 village’s pig”). But its opposite is aka’la ’obo, “wild pig” (litt. “jungle
 pig”), and neither stress nor form, and hardly even its meaning, would
 mark it as a composite word. Here we have the syntactical construction
 of the subordinative type (1) of V.7. Similarly there is no doubt about
 words like ambu-lo, “dead (man’s) body”, and ki-lo, “infant boy” (from
 do, “man,    male’), being composite.       On    the other hand      a construction
 like do mije, which we have already mentioned as a composite word
 in III. 2. 1., has little else to mark it as morphological or syntactical
 14                       GRAMMAR       OF   THE    SENTANI       LANGUAGE
 than its meaning, and, as subject in the sentence, its predicate. Thus
 do-mije can mean “human being”         (“man-woman”) and is then con-
 structed with a verbal predicate in the singular, eg., do-mije hadake,
 “human being (who) died, dead person”. This is clearly a composite
 word. The construction can also mean “people” and then takes a verb
 in the plural, e.g. Ohej do-mije akajde, “the people of Ohej went off”.
 This we can still regard as a composite word. But do mije may also
 very    simply     mean       “man      (and)     woman”          or    “men     (and)    women”,
naturally with the verb in the plural or dual as the case may be. The
last mentioned construction is syntactical of the serial coordinative type
without coordinator (see V.6). But it should be remarked that these
distinctions are not always so clearly marked as our analysis would
lead us to suppose. Thus in a sentence like jej bi foma do da mije da
jejbojme da da bodojdobojme, “hey there, coconut rat, if you could
become a human being (litt.: to man (or) to woman), you would under-
stand me”, the two constituents of what should be the one composite
word do-mije are each separately followed by the postposition da.
   Similar cases are such constructions, already mentioned in III. 2. 1,
as obo-joku, “animal” (litt. “pig-dog”) and kaji-i’fa, “canoe (in gene-
ral)”, which can also have their litteral meaning of “pig(s) (and) dog(s)” ;
“women’s        (and)    men’s     canoe(s)”.       Although            in the second      example
stress seems to be more distinctive because i’fa (like ka’ji) carries an
irregular final stress, the two vowels,                 on the other hand,             never   seem
to be contracted as in jobo forementioned.
   Similar problems sometimes arise where repetition is concerned. For
nominal forms it is not too difficult to decide. While examples as
duka-duka, “thick, massive’, and foma-foma, “light” (if they are at
all derived from        duka,     “stone”,       and foma,        “coconut      rat” and   are not
merely    homonymous            with    these     nouns),     have       a distinct meaning      of
their own, an expression like ja ja may be translated by “daily”, but
really means no more than “day (and) day, day (after) day”, and need
not be regarded as anything else than a syntactical construction.
   For repetition of verbal forms, however, the decision may sometimes
seem     more     difficult.    Here,     moreover,         the    choice       may   be   between
derivational and flexional repetition. Thus the repetition of verbal
forms, dealt with in V. 6, is to be regarded as a syntactical coordinative
construction because the constituents are each fully, independently
and identically inflected forms, retaining their proper stress, and the
meaning of the combination remaining unchanged, although repetitive ;

variant of the derivational repetition of III.2. supra. Also, unlik
 syntactical repetition of verbal forms, the two constituents are not
 identical and not independent, and they do not have each the same
functional position in the compound.","[21, 22, 23]"
"   In the foregoing chapters certain subjects of a semi-syntactical nature
have been mentioned because they were marginal features showing
points which are reminiscent of both morphology and syntax, or because
they were necessary for a good understanding of morphological phe-
nomena. In the latter category belongs, for instance, the discussion
in III. 4.4 on the aspectual value of tenses, which was necessary for
understanding the nature of what I have named the aspectual affixes.
In the former belong discussions on borderline cases, such as those
in III. 2.2 and III. 4. 11. Interpenetration of levels cannot always be
avoided in a complicated language as Sentani. In this chapter on Syntax
such features will be touched upon again, but only to the extent that
is necessary. Thus the discussion on borderline cases will only be
mentioned in passing, when giving examples of syntactic constructions
concerned therein, but the question of aspect and tense, which was
only briefly mentioned in III. 4.4, will be gone into in much greater
 detail when giving examples of the distinctions between them, and
their use in the sentence.",[59]
"   The relationship terms “father” and “mother”, when taking the
possessive of the 1° and 3 person before them, supply a special
possessive-determined form, which can be regarded as “flexional”, and
which       is ako for “father”     and naka    for “mother”.   Normally        these
words are only used in the sense of “venerable old man, old woman’,
the normal terms for “genitor” and “genitrix” being adaj, ajdej and
ana respectively. The latter are used as vocatives by the child speaking
to its parents, and with a zero allomorph of the 2™ person possessive,
ie, without special indication of the possessive in this person unless
it is stressed, as the possessive-determined form for the 2"" person by
others addressing the parents’ child or children. The suppletive allo-
morph ako, “father”, takes, in principle, the possessives of the ITI”
series before it, but the 1** p. du., pl. me(j) is also used as suppletive
allomorph for the 1°* p.sg., and the construction, unless when the
possessive     is stressed,   is contracted   so as to become   one word,       thus:
me-ko, “my, our father”; ne-ko, “his, their father”. It can, therefore,
be best described as a composite form as distinct from the simple
preposing of the possessives of series II, III and IV, which is a syn-
tactical process (cf. V.7). It cannot be regarded as a prefixed form,
since me- and ng- are not bound forms, but also occur independently.
There is then a clear analogy with the composition of nouns described
in III. 2.1 and III. 2.2 as distinct from the syntactical subordinative
combination of nouns.
   The suppletive form naka, “mother”, also takes the 1** p. du., pL for
the 1** p.sg., but, having an initial consonant, the contraction affects
the possessive differently: ma-naka, “my, our mother”; na-naka, “his,
their, mother’. Here we have a borderline case between composed
and prefixed form; but for the sake of uniformity I prefer to treat
        Verh. dl. 47                                                        2

this form as the preceding, with the additional                            note that the vowel
has been strongly affected and weakened to a.
      The     relationship        terms   awaw,     “mother’s      brother”,      and    aka,    “elder
brother, or sister”, follow the same rules, both as to the type of
possessive and the contraction, as ako, “father”, but they are not
suppletive possessive-determined forms themselves, e.g., ne-waw, “his
uncle’.
    In the 2"" p. there is, as we have said, not even suppletion for the
words “father” and “mother”, and the normal “vocative’ forms of
all four relationship words mentioned may be used for the 2™ p. without
any indication of person. If it is necessary to stress the possessive,
however,           the   III""    series   is used   here   also,    eg.,   ana,    wej    ana,    “thy
mother” ; aka, wej aka, “thy elder brother” ; etc.
   Lastly it should be noted that in several cases nowadays younger
more regular forms appear besides these irregular, but more normal,
ones. This may be due to a growing modernization, reflected in the
language as well as in other spheres of life.","[25, 26]"
"    Four main series of forms of the personal pronoun can be distin-
 guished, which we can regard as inflected by means of phonetic root
 change or apophony,                since, although historically they may           represent
 16                    GRAMMAR        OF THE     SENTANI   LANGUAGE
little more than different degrees of emphasis, they have largely specific
grammatical functions. Some types have abbreviated or contracted
subforms. The following table shows the four series.","[23, 24]"
"  Words derived by composition (derivational composition as distinct
from flexional composition) consist of usually two constituent words
which together have the characteristics of a single unit. They are
nouns denoting either a generality or collectivity of the combined
sememes       of the constituents,        or a determination      of the 2""* constituent
by the first, or, if the determinant is an adjective, inversely, or a
relation of origin in which the second constituent stands to the first.
Sometimes the compound consists of a short phrase, in which case it
may contain more than two constituents. Examples: do-mtje, “human
being(s)”,     from   do,   “man”,    and    mije,    “woman”;      obo-joku,   “animal”,
from obo, “pig”; and joku, “dog” ; kaji-i’fa, “canoe (in general)”, from
ka’jt, “big women’s canoe”, and 7’fa, “small men’s canoe”; isam-fa’la,
“war”, from isam, “anger”, and fa’la, “bow-and-arrow”; jobo, “tame
pig’, from jo, “village”, and obo, “pig”; u-makaj, “character” (from
u, “body, person”, and makaj, “manner, way”); a-few, “language”,
from a, “voice, sound”, and few, “tongue”; ambu-lo, “dead (man’s)
body” (cf. do, “man”); ambo-mije, “id. (woman’s)’; ki-lo, “infant
(boy)”; ki-mije, “infant (girl)”; Ohej-jo, “the village O.”; Jawbe-jo,
“J. village” ; u-foj, “slave”, from u, “body”, and fo7, “good” (as distinct
from u foj, “good, t.e. healthy, body”) ; but in inverse order: hoko’lo-fa,
“the younger or youngest child (of a family)” (as distinct from fa
ho’kolo, “the or a young child”); ba’na-fa, “the elder or eldest child
(of a family)” (as distinct from fa’bana, “the older child’’); a’hamam,
“food”, from aha, “thing”, and am-am, i.e. an(a)-an(a), “eating” (with
shift of the stress to the contracted vowel);                  and with short phrases:
a’han(a)jala, “rations”, from aha, “thing”, and anajjale, “he uses to

eat”   (habitualis);     jokejjo    [jokejgo],    “enemy”,      from   jo,    “village,
people”, kej, “throwing”, and again jo; etc.
   A sort of abstract nouns is sometimes indicated by preposing                     the
                         na, na, n- in composition,       and this may       be, origi-
3°? person pronoun
nally and essentially, the same formation as that of certain “adverbial”
expressions with this pronoun (cf. III. 3.1 and V.8); eg. na-hala,
“Justice” (cf. hala, “right, true, rea *). na-bam, “badness, sin” (cf.
bam, “not, no good”); n-ama, n-ama-foma, “entirety, totality”, and
hence: na n-ama (-foma) na, “in its entirety, entirely” (cf. ama(-foma),
“whole, all, entire’).
   Derived by composition is also the numeral “5”, those from “1” to
“4” being simple root-forms, while those from “6” to “Q” are partly
composed. and partly syntactical constructions, and those for “10” and
higher are only syntactical; e.g., mahambay, “5 (<ma fe ambaj,
“handpalm      one”); but mahina       ambaj,     “6” (< ma     ahi na ambaj,       “on
the other hand one”); mahina be, “7” (< ma ahi na be, “on the other
hand 2”); mahina         nama,     “8”; mahina     kali, “9”.   For the syntactical
constructions, see V.6 and V. 8.","[20, 21]"
"    The tenses, besides indicating a time element, also have other proper-
ties which belong in the aspectual sphere. We have named them “tenses”
because of that time element, and there is no more objection to this
than there is to the use of that term in other languages in which time
is not the only characteristic feature of the categories concerned. This
has, moreover, the advantage that we can use the term “aspectual” for
a category of affixes with which we shall now deal, and which, though
not aspectual in the sense accepted for certain better known modern
languages, do determine the aspect of a verb as to its goal. We shall
go into the temporal and aspectual features of both tenses and aspectual
forms in greater detail in the chapter on Syntax (see V.9). Here
suffice it to add that I had named                    the latter forms “modal”         in my
Notes       on    Sentani     Grammar,      mentioned     in the     Introduction,    because
they “modify” the verb in the indicated sense. But this term is equivocal
in view of the real “moods” which Sentani possesses. Also the aspectual
affixes are not restricted to any one mood, but occur in all moods,
including the negative and the vetative, and are even found in the
24                             GRAMMAR         OF    THE   SENTANI       LANGUAGE
gerund. We shall name the forms with aspectual affixes secondary
forms as against the primary forms without them.
   Morphophonemically the aspectual affixes are distinct from the other
verbal affixes, for both mood,                        tense     and     person,      in that their vowels
are practically always constant, although this may be largely due to
the fact that in the verbal structure they happen to be always followed
by a consonant.19 Only -bo- in quick speech sometimes contracts with
the habitualis -7a- to -bajo-, bijo- for the more normal -bojo-. If the
aspect affix begins with a vowel and the preceding flexional element
of the verb ends in a vowel,                         the two      vowels       are not contracted,              but
linked by the consonant -j-, e.g., awa-j-am                                   (for *aw-a-a-m),            “let us
two row off”. In the indicative the aspect affix immediately precedes
the sign for tense, which means for the secondary future preceding its
-n- in all persons except the 2° p.du. where, the tense sign being
zero, it precedes               the mood            ending,     eg.     ho-do-bo-nde,              “TI shall kill
(something), but ho-bo-be (2™ p.du.). In the habitualis, which, with
the aspect affixes, forms a kind of iterative (cf. V.9), the preceding
root has the usual -j- extension, e.g., dawa-j-bo-j-ale, “I am used to
open (it) every time’. In the adhortative the aspect affix is found at
the extreme end of the verbal structure, except in the 1** p.s., du., pl.
in which an additional -m follows it, e.g., ho-j-bo, “kill thou (some-
10 Historically speaking, the aspectual affixes, with the exception of -nu, may
   well have been short verbal roots, and the secondary forms may really have
   been composite forms originally. This is almost certain for some of the directive
   affixes which, with the exception of -di- (verbs never end in a high vowel,
   apart from the variants mentioned in III. 4.1), still occur as verbal roots as
   well. And some of the objective affixes, such as -ko- and -bo-, may have had
   something to do with verbs as ko-, “‘do, act”, and bo-, “aim, beat”, although
   these meanings are not now recognizable. However, the secondary forms
     cannot    now      be    regarded    as    composite       verbs    in   the    sense    of    III.4.9.    The
     reasons are: (1) they all follow the same structural rules as forms with the
     reflexive affix -nu-, which is certainly not a verb, but seems to be derived
     from na u > n-u, “his body, his person, his self’, while, moreover, for many
     of them    there        is no   comparable       verbal    root    in existence;        (2)   containing    an
     aspectual affix, they cannot take a second aspectual affix, whereas the com-
     posite forms of III. 4.9 can take such an affix; (3) they can consist of verbal
     root with directive affix identical to the root; (4) the composite forms of
     III. 4.9 place the personal object affix partly in similar, but partly in different
     positions from those it occupies in the secondary forms; (5) the personal
     subject affixes are in some persons different from those in the composite
     forms;    (6)   the aspectual       affix always         follows   its verbal     root, as do all verbal
      affixes (except the negative), whereas the verbal roots which correspond to
      directive affixes always precede the other verbal constituent when they enter
     into the composition of ITI. 4.9.

thing) !”, but ho-do-bo-m, ho-da-bo-m, “let me kill (s.)”, and h-a-bo-m
(1° p. du.) and ho-ma-bo-m (1** p. pl). In the conditional the aspect
affix immediately precedes the ending -be in all persons except the
1°t and 2™ p.s., in which it precedes the ending -le and -me respectively,
with an intervening repeated person sign -j- in the latter form, eg.,
je-w-bo-be, “should he become” but je-j-bo-le (1** p.s.) and je-j-bo-j-me
(2™ p.s.). In the negative, the vetative and the gerund the aspect affix
occurs immediately after the -j- of the root extension, or, in the case
of the vetative, the -j- of the 2"" p.s., which j is, in negative and vetative,
repeated after the aspect affix; e.g., a-ho-j-bo-j, “not kill” (negative) ;
g-ho-j-bo-j-je, “do not kill” (vetat. 2"" p.s.); but 0-j-bo, “descending”
(gerund).
      There are four types of aspect affixes, viz.:
(1)      those that determine the action of the verb                as to its direction,
either    in space   or     in time,     and   can,   therefore,   occur   in intransitive
verbs; we shall call them directive ;
(2) those that determine the action of the verb as to its object, and
therefore cannot occur in intransitive verbs ; we will call them objective ;
(3) the medial affix -bo- which indicates that the action is done for
or in favour of the subject itself or happens by itself, and hence may
be both transitive and intransitive; sometimes this function is, however,
not so clear ;
(4) the reflexive affix -nu- which functionally could be compared with
a personal object affix, but which word-structurally follows the same
rules as the aspect affixes, can take a pronominal object affix in
addition (notably for the indirect object), and hence is treated here.","[31, 32, 33]"
"   The Sentani word is either a simple or a complex form. But a form
is not necessarily a word, because some forms occur in bound position
only. A simple word contains one root. A complex word consists of
one or more roots to which a morphological process has been applied.
The morphological processes are:
1.   prefixation to verbal roots of the negative prefix a- (unique case) ;
2.   affixation, by which we understand the adding to the verbal struc-
     ture of all flexional elements which follow the root, irrespective
     of their own mutual         order;
3.   phonetic root change or apophony;
4,   suppletion, including (unique case) zero feature;
5.   morphological repetition (dialectally also represented                by   redupli-
     cation), as distinct from syntactical repetition ;
6.   composition ;
7.  combination of two or more of these processes.
   Complex words can be distinguished in derived and inflected forms,
according to the criteria set forth for this distinction by L. Bloomfield
(Language, London 1950, pp. 223-4), although, as we shall see, these
sometimes fail us.
   Derivation is limited to the processes mentioned under nos. 5 and 6.
Flexional processes include all of those mentioned.",[19]

"V.5.    Postpositional phrases.
   Postpositional constructions consist of a noun, a pronoun or a verbal
form followed by a postposition, or, except with verbal forms, a post-
positional phrase as relation marker. The postposition is enclitic; eg.,
ifa na, “in the (men’s) canoe”; bu na, “in the water’; jo da, “to the
village”; ime da, “from the house”; do jele, “with the man’; da da,
“to me, for me”; naje jele, “with him’ (stressed); maka da, “for what,
what for’, to what end?” ; maka na, “in what, because of what, why ?” ;
bele na, “in that, because of that, therefore, hence”; dej na, “as mine,
as my own”; dika na, “yonder”; hina le, “whose?’; makale na (or
na), “in I came, i.e., when       (or if or as or because)        I came”;   mokom-
bonde na (or na), “when (or if or as or because) he will do” ; dakakawna
na, “because he awaited him”; adale da, “for I will see, i.¢., in order
that I shall see”; dowale da, “in order that we two will take’ nundew-
boke da, “from (that) he disappeared, i.¢., after he disappeared” ; hadake
da, “from (that) he died, after he died” ; etc.
   If a noun is followed by an adjective, the postposition follows the
latter, e.g., jo ahaw na, “in a far village” ; u kaban da, “for a big body,
i. in great style” ; do ambaj da, “to one (i.e. a certain) man” ; etc.
   In postpositional constructions consisting of a noun or pronoun
followed by a postpositional phrase, the latter functions as a pseudo
postposition itself, e.g., bu aj na, “in the water”, i.e. “mid lake” (lit. “in
the water’s inside”) ; bu a na, “beneath the water, under water” ; jakala
dan da, “from up south” ; na. buko da, “to his presence, before him” ; etc.

  The postpositional phrase may be stressed as such by the emphatic
particle je, eg., awfadake da je mawwalewboke, “from (that) he went-
died even he came back to life’ ; awnundewboke da je mawjakalawboke,
“from (that) he went-disappeared even he came-became visible again” ;
etc. It can also be repeated as such to indicate frequency or intensity,
eg. na u da u da, nej da nej da fojadewkoke, “they both embraced
only their bodies, their own selves”; nej da nej da danojkoke, “they
both pulled (it) to themselves, 1.e., each to himself” ; etc.","[62, 63]"
"   The indication of person (with number) for the subject takes place
in different manners for primary and for secondary forms. In primary
forms the affixes for the subject person can formally be divided in
two main categories, which can be termed (1) the actual and (2) the
eventual. The two are, however, not always clearly separated, and
there is some interpenetration. The “actual” forms are found in those
tenses of the indicative which indicate that an action is actually taking
place in the present, or has actually taken place in the past, viz. the
present, the habitualis, the imperfect and the aorist. The                            “eventual”
affixes occur in those forms which indicate that an action will happen
or is expected, supposed, desired or forbidden to happen, viz., the
future, partly the adhortative and the conditional, and the vetative.
The deviations in the adhortative are the 3"" p.s.,du and pl., which
are similar to the “actual” forms, while in the conditional the deviation
in the 1** p.s. may well be so only in outward appearance, because the
-d- element of the “eventual” 1°‘ p.s. may be concealed in the / of the
ending -le. The 2"" p.s. has elements of both categories; the 3"" p.s. is
similar to the “actual”.
   The      most      striking    characteristic     feature    of   the   “actual”     and   the
“eventual” person affixes as distinct from each other is, that, while
the former seem to have little or no formal relation with the absolute
personal pronouns nor with the personal object affixes, the latter for
the greater part do show such a relation. This is, as far as the future
is concerned, clearly the case at least for the 1** p.s. and pl., the 2™ p. du.
and pl., and (with the absolute pronoun, not the object affix) for the
28                    GRAMMAR    OF THE SENTANI           LANGUAGE3° p.s., du. and pl. Even for the 2"" p.s. there is a possibility that a w
has been dropped before the modal ending -le; this -w- at least appears,
in forms with an incorporated person object affix, immediately before
it, and is also found in the secondary future.
    The following table gives the two categories of subject affixes:

3” pl.      -aj-                     -naj-                       -aj   These person affixes, as far as the categories I and II (a) are
concerned, precede the modal element for the indicative according
to the morphophonemic rules stated for the latter (cf. III. 4.2). As
for II (b), the modal sign for the adhortative being zero (and
that for the vetative, which otherwise is similar to the 2"" persons
of the adhortative, being a prefix and a particle), these affixes are,
of course, final. An exception is the 2° p. du. of the adhortative
which has -bu, b not being admitted as final. In accordance with
the morphophonemic rules already stated for the treatment of final
root vowels in contact with following affix vowels, the initial a-vowels
in these person affixes too drop after preceding vowel, while the
initial a-vowels persist after preceding a, a or back vowel, and
contract to ¢ with a preceding front vowel. In the 2” p.s. “actual” ¢ is
linked to a preceding vowel by the juncture consonant -j-. The allo-
morphs -a- and -a- for the “actual” 1° p. du. and pl., which occur only
in combination with certain object affixes, take this same juncture
consonant -7-, when followed by a vowel, and then are similar to the
3° p. du. and pl. The allomorph -w- of the 3"" p.s. “actual” too occurs
before a person object affix. Examples: m-a-le, “T come” (present) ;
ma-j-e, “thou comest”; ma-le, “he comes”; ma-da-le, “I shall come” ;
ma-da, “let me come” (adhort.); ma-n-de, “he will come”; ma-w, “he
must come”; ma-w-be, “you two come” (present) ; ma-be (< *ma-b-be),

“you two will come”; ma-bu, “come you two!”                                  (adhort.) ; ma-k-a-le,
“I came”          (aorist); ma-ka-j-de,         “they two came”                  (aor.); mok-a-le,     “I
make,       do,    work”     (present);       moko-n-de,          “he     will     make’;   moko-bu,
“make you two!” (adhort.); etc. For examples                                of the allomorphs           in
use with object affixes, see III. 4. 7-8.","[35, 36, 37]"
"V.9.    Tense and aspect in the sentence.
   As we have already briefly indicated in III. 4. 4, the tenses, as I have
named these categories, have also other properties than those relative
to time. The present represents an action still continuing at the moment
of observation or envisaged as such in descriptive statements, and it
is, therefore, durative, imperfective        and indeterminate, but in the
present, eg. Abaw imoli da danole            Nakahabo ube da danole, “the

and indeterminate, quality, but envisaged for an action in
eg. Ajokoj na ka’ji na ahamam                 anawole,       “A. ate her food in her
                                                                on the
canoe’; Ohej jo na nakawole, “he lived at O.”. The aorist,
                                                                     the
other hand, is a past punctual, a momentaneous past. It represents
                                                                   very
action at the same time as momentaneous or having lasted only a
short time and as finished.         It is, therefore,        determinate and perfective
                                                                   would
even in its primary form. It is also used in contexts, where we
                                                                        it
use a perfect or even a pluperfect. In its repeated form (cf. V.6)
stands for intermittent short or momentaneous actions, repeated by
intervals. Examples: nabe ko ma nake dowke mo nahi'bi na ma na
ojboj-owboke, “he stretched out his hand (to) that coconut just men-
tioned, took (it), then suddenly it fell apart in his hand”; Sbala Jakah
Buwaj jo da make Ohej jo na make nakawole, “Abalo Jakali came
from Buwaj village, came in Ohej village, and stayed (living) (there)”,
               in the aorist, but nakawole           in the imperfect;         foma   ambay
with make
ko na anke anke jele, “a coconut rat, after he has eaten (and) eaten
(with intervals) coconuts, comes up”, with repeated aorist followed by
the present; Hijaka honkawna honkawna Dajma a da owduwke, “H.
burned him (and) burned him, (and) D. fell down” ; balakajde balakajde
mo Dbew        Nokahabo        da wawno...,         “(after) they two had plunged
(and) plunged, the Tortoise to the Lobster said-to-him ...”; etc.
   The primary future is more or less indifferent to aspect, and so are
the primary adhortative and conditional, while the primary habitualis,
as the name     indicates, is durative.       However,         see more in detail, infra.
   The so-called “tenses”, therefore, also have largely aspectual value
even in primary form. The secondary forms, however, which are formed
with what I have named the aspectual affixes (see ITI.4.4), are
aspectual in this sense that the action is envisaged as to its goal, either
— in the case of transitive verbs — with reference to an “object”,
direct or indirect, or — in the case of both transitive and intransitive
verbs — with reference to direction, either in space or in time, or to
 self. The secondary forms are, then, determinate as to effect on goal,
 whereas a perfective primary tense, as the primary aorist, is determinate
 as to duration of action, the imperfective tenses being indeterminate.
 This determinating power is characteristic of the aspectual affixes.
 Hence they are very frequent with the only really perfective and
 determinate    tense,   the    aorist,   if this   refers     to a definite    object,   and
 practically indispensable with it if at the same time it takes a personal
  64                          GRAMMAR      OF     THE   SENTANI       LANGUAGE
  object affix. As a rule, though not always, the object affix then refers
 to the indirect object, the aspect affix referring to the direct goal as
  described        above,     which    statement        must,    however,      be qualified      by the
  reservation that “object”,               “direct” and          “indirect”      in this connection
  need not always correspond to the English conceptions; e.g., i fowna-
  nake, “he jabbed fire at him” (in which i, “fire”, is the direct object,
  and     the     obj. aff.   -na-     refers     to the     indirect    object);       na    kada-nala
  wahewmikoke, “he divided their goods to them” (“goods” being direct,
  and -mi-, “them”, referring to indirect object); but in aka mije jawaw-
  nohonde,        “thou wilt accompany thy elder brother’s wife”, the object
  affix    -no-     refers    to the     direct     object      aka   mije    itself.   See    also   the
  discussion in V.7, type (9).
    Exceptions to the foregoing are found in certain verbs which by
 their nature already imply a specific effect on a direct object and hence
 omit the aspect affix, but always take a personal object affix for the
 indirect object, eg., ukawna, “he said to him, told him (words)”
 (aorist) ; kolukawna, “he held him (by the hand or shoulder, etc.)” ; etc.
_ On the other hand some transitive verbs appear consistently in the
  primary aorist, without either aspect affix or object affix, e.g., dowke,
  “he took, received”. For intransitive verbs absence of a direct object
  is, of course, the rule, but an indirect object may be added, e.g., kt
 owowna,          “saliva dribbled-him          (lit. “descended-him”’).          If an intransitive
  verb occurs in the secondary aorist with a directive aspect affix, it is
  more or less inchoative, e.g., owoke, “he descended” (i.¢., “he started
  to descend”).                                                            .
     For similar reasons as make them so frequent with the perfective
 aorist, the aspect affixes are incompatible with the really imperfective
 tenses: the present and the imperfect, even when they refer to a direct
 object, and even when they take a personal object affix. Examples:
 fije-fe mo kowmake na ne-waw ukawmi do fi hawajkoke, “because
 he acted on only in that manner, his mother’s brother ordered people
 (and) they loaded the sago” (in which the asp. aff. -ma- indicates
 a hitherward movement in time; the 3"" p. pl. obj aff. -mi- added to
 the primary aorist of “say to, tell” refers to do, “men”; and the active
 transitive asp. aff. -ko- to the dir. obj. fi, “sago”); nawmeke mo A bala
 Jakalt hubajejkoke, “he had just put off, (then) he met (lit. they two
 met!) 4. J.” (in which -me- indicates a movement away and downwards
in space); hokolo be do jele mije jele jejbokajde nakajake, “the two
young (ones) became (and) remained (settled as) husband and wife”
(in which je-, “give”, with medial asp. aff. -bo- means “become” ; and

the asp. aff. -a- in nakajake indicates a movement away, onward, in
time); Hubulew u bana mo je nakawnamake: mahe mokodambonde?,
“In H.’s body only the thought came to dwell along: how shall I do

   The apparent inconsistency in the foregoing discussion, viz. the
habitualis, which   is durative and hence     imperfective,   but yet can take
an aspect affix, is not really inconsistent. For although in its totality
extending over a large segment of time, the action of this tense need
not be continuous. It may consist of a series of single units which
each in itself can be envisaged as momentaneous or of very short
duration and as such perfective. The effect of the aspect affixes on the
habitualis is, then, to transform it into a series of repeated single
goal-determined actions, a kind of iterative, therefore, determinate as to
goal; e.g., dej heke ambaj ada bolu bam honojale, “I have a garden (but)
it lies all the time (i.e. continuously) without seedlings” (in which
honojale is in the primary habitualis) ; ja ja daje mokojjale, “day (and)
day I am used to work” (continuously, primary habitualis); am fe
habakaj da olejjajde, “they use to roll banana leaf for tobacco” (as
before); ko bojjajde bojjajde makaj, ko ahejjajde ahejjajde makaj,
“they are chopping the coconut apparently, they are peeling the coconut
apparently” (as before); but Ajokoj hajejkojowna Jakali ka’la najkaj

every single time) Ajokoj let him loose, Jakali made a terrible uproar;
therefore A. every time got hold of him (again)” (in which the asp.
affixes -ko- and -bo- turn the action of the three habitualis forms
concerned into a series of repeated single actions of short duration
determinate as to goal); fa bam wali bam ajajnujane,            “without fear
(and) without life (expression for “carelessly”) thou goest-behavest |

fole is in the present, and the other verbs are all in the secondary

   A similar distinction in determination as exists between the aorist
and the imperfective tenses, is found between the secondary future
and the primary future. Hence the distinction between primary and
secondary future is very much like that in modern Greek between
a futurum praesentis (or continuum) and a futurum aoristt (or ab-
solutum). The same is, mutatis mutandis, the case for the distinction
between primary and secondary adhortative and primary and secondary
conditional. Examples: ukawna hondombi fonde folonkonde, “he told
him to go across (and) cut hondombi”                    (lit. “he told him he will go
across (and) will...”; in which fonde is in the primary future, but
folonkonde has the asp. aff. -ko- referring to hondombi 2° and deter-
mining the action as to this object and perfectivating it as to time) ;
foj am fe kamawbonde dawawmande, “go across to (lit. thou wilt)
tear off a banana leaf (and) to (lit. thou wilt) bring it home” (with
asp. affixes -bo- and -ma-); mahe mokodambonde?, “how shall I act
towards him, what shall I do to him?” (with medial -bo- and obj. aff.
-m- for -n- referring to the indir. obj.); hakaj bolu fam bale dawaw-
famande      ba?,   “wilt    thou     bring    me   some       more    hakaj     seedlings?”
(with asp. aff. -ma-, “hither”, in dawa-, “take”, which makes “bring” ;
and with obj. aff. 1** p.s. -fa-, dial. for -da- after -w-); balajsa adabom,
“open (it) (and) let us two see” (adhort. 2"" p.s. with asp. aff. -ha-
referring to the things in the package; and adhort. 1° p.du. with
asp. aff. -bo-); do da mije da jejbojme dej na a wajajde bodojdobojme,
“if thou shouldst become man (or) woman, thou wouldst understand
my words (that) I would say to thee” (in which je-, “give”, plus medial
-bo- makes      “become”;      bodo-,    “hear”,    plus     -bo- makes      “understand” ;
the obj. aff. -do- refers to the indir. obj. “me”, the dir. obj. being a,
“voice, words”; while wajajde must contain the obj. aff. -jaj- of the
2"" p.s., but must not take an asp. aff.) ; etc.
   After the foregoing there seems to be no further need to give
examples of the use of the aspect affixes in the uninflected and partly
inflected forms: the gerund, the negative and the vetative.","[70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75]"
"   Characteristic of certain types of phrase is that word junction in
them is accompanied by similar phonetic modifications, syntacto-
phonemic features in this case, as we have seen occurring in mor-
phology in the shape of morphophonemics (II. 1). This is not to say
that such phenomena are always entirely absent in other phrase types
or even in the wider context of the sentence, nor that in those phrases
in which they are common they are obligatory. But they are rare in
the former and frequent in the latter, and if in the latter they are not,
strictly speaking, indispensable, they are yet very regularly observed.
   Such types of phrase are notably postpositional and subordinative
combinations, and those with the emphatic particle je; e.g., bum mele
jah jele, “and fat and round” (with postpos. jele, “with”); mandilin
na or mandilim ma, “in cold, for cold” (postpos. na after --m); Hubulew
fa (dial.) = Hubulew da, “to H.” (postpos. da); hakaj sa = hakaj da,
“for hakaj (a plant)” ; foj sala, “very good”, but na hala, “it (is) much” ;
nej seke, “his (own) garden”, but nej heke, “his (is) a garden, he has
a garden”; dej hakaj bolu najkaj sala, “mine (is) very extraordinary
hakaj-seed” ; ahaw we, “yet, still far-off” (with emphatic particle je);
etc. If in other typesof construction, notably coordinative combinations,
we find similar features, we are justified in doubting whether they
are at all syntactical or rather derivational and composite (III. 2. 1), or
at least in regarding them as borderline cases (III. 2.2), eg., balaw
sabakaj,    “betel (and) tobacco”,        ie. the ingredients of the betelquid,
                                     SYNTAX                                  53
and hence “betelquid”. As usual we shall write in our phonemicization
only the heterophonemic variants, and in the case of /h/, the [s]
allophone.","[60, 61]"
"III. 4.11.   The   gerund.
   By repetition of root forms is formed a verbal noun or gerund.
Structurally there are two types which are distinguished by (1) a dis-
syllabic or polysyllabic root, ending in -a preceded by one of the
consonants admitted as finals, and (2) all other roots. The former
tending, as we have seen (II. 4. 1 and III. 4. 1), to treat this consonant
as root-final, it repeats the root in this form, with the consonant as
final, e.g., hon-som (for *hom-hom < *hon-hon), “burning”, from
hona-,   “burn,    grill, roast”;   am-am   (for *an-an),   “eating”,   from   ana-,
“eat”? (cf. the composite word a’hamam, “food”, lit. “things (for)
eating’’); dow-dow, “taking, receiving”, from dowa-, “take”; etc. The
other type adds -7- to the root as in certain other flexional forms (see
t.a. III. 4. 2-4), eg. a-j-a-j, “going”; from a-, “go”; o-j-o-7, “descend-
ing’, from o-, “descend”; be-7-be-j, “seeking’’, from be-, “seek”; he-j-
sé-j, “hanging”, from he-, “hang’”’; etc.
  The gerund can also be formed from secondary forms, in which case
40                 GRAMMAR   OF THE SENTANI   LANGUAGEthe repetition is omitted, and the aspect affix takes the place of the
second constituent of the repetition, eg., a-j-di, “going up” (with
directive asp. aff. -di-); 0-j-bo, “collapsing, falling down’ (from o-,
“descend”, with asp. aff. -bo-); de-j-ko, “penetrating, driving into” (as
of tree-roots); huw-bo,   “feeling” (from huwa- and asp. aff. -bo-); etc.
     Similarly the gerund of roots indicating a movement    may as first
constituent enter into composition with other verbal roots as second
constituent, e.g., a-j-saba, “going-throw” ; ma-j-saba, coming-throw” ;
i.e., “throwing thither” and “throwing hither” respectively, from haba-,
“throw, cast, strike’.
   This gerund may also combine with another flexional form of the
same verb to intensify its meaning. This construction, though more or
less a borderline case, is to be regarded as composite and flexional for
the reasons set forth in III. 2.2, last para. Also it shows a peculiarity
which is also found in other composite flexional verb forms, viz. the
juncture consonant -7- between a final vowel of the 1** and an initial
vowel of the 2” constituent; e.g., de-j-ko - de-w-no-ko-ke, “penetrating,
it penetrated into it” (gerund of de- with asp. aff. -ko- plus 3"" p.s.
secondary aorist with -ko-, and with obj. aff. 3°° p.s. -no-); but o-j-bo
-j- o-w-bo-ke, “collapsing it collapsed” (gerund of o-, “descend, fall”,
with asp. aff. -bo- plus 3™° p.s. secondary aorist with -bo-; the two
constituents linked by -j- between the final vowel of the first and the
initial vowel of the second) ; etc.

            Model: root wa- + obj. aff., “say to, tell’.","[47, 48, 49, 50]"
"    The Sentani language has 7 vocalic and 10 consonantal phonemes.
 Apart from minor non-distinctive deviations, vowel phonemes have as
 a rule very fixed phonetic values. But consonantal phonemes are very
 rich in non-distinctive variants of often strongly deviating phonetic
 types. These allophones are, generally speaking, “free”, although to a
 certain extent combinatory influences play their part. Only in some
 cases allophones are positionally “bound”.
     However,       in   addition    to   the    “normal”     non-distinctive    variation
 referred to above, in which the allophonic limits of the phonemes con-
 cerned are not exceeded, there occurs for certain phonemes under
 certain combinatory conditions an equally non-distinctive variation
 which does exceed the phonemes’ limits of non-distinctiveness. Here
 there is, therefore, neutralization of the opposition between the pho-
 nemes involved in this type of variation. As in the case of the normal
 allophonic variants, these heterophonemic variants are partly “free”,
_ partly positionally “bound”.
     Thus the /h/ phoneme has               an    [s]    allophone   which   is obligatory
 after nasal, /j/ and /i/, eg.              kejsi,      “throw away!”    (with aspectual
 affix -hi-), but kej-na-hi (with incorporated pronominal object affix).
 But this allophone [s] also occurs after /w/, e.g. kewsike, “he threw
 away (aorist)”, in which position, though, it is not obligatory. For
 here a heterophonemic non-distinctive variant of this /h ~~ s/ phoneme
 is also possible, and, as far as my observations go, even more frequent.
 This variant is [f], itself a labiodental variant of the fricative phoneme
 // which as such has both labiodental and bilabial allophones. Hence
 there is, after /w/, freedom of choice between allophonic [s] and
 heterophonemic [f], but this choice is obligatory, e.g. kewfike or kewsike,
  and not *kewhtke.
      In certain speech-forms, notably in the central dialect, this [s] and
   [f] may even occur as non-distinctive variants of the /d/ phoneme,
  after /j/ and /w/ respectively. This may be due to the facts described
  in note (5) hereafter. We will normally disregard these dialectal
  peculiarities, except in those texts in which they happen to occur. We
4                         GRAMMAR   OF      THE   SENTANI       LANGUAGE
will, of course, equally disregard in our spelling normal non-distinctive
combinatory changes, such as [fi] for /n/ and                          [d’} or [t’] for /d/
after /j/ and /i/; etc. But we cannot, in our phonemic notation, neglect
the heterophonemic variation, which occurs in our eastern dialect. Nor
even can we, in my opinion, ignore in our notation the allophone [s]
of the /h/ phoneme, because of its obligatory nature and its deviating
phonetic type. Similar considerations apply to the partial neutralization
of /d/ and /1/, and the mutual assimilations of the nasals /m/ and
/n/, or their interchange in assimilation to other consonants; and
certain other phenomena.
   In the following pages these phonetic phenomena, both of an allo-
phonic and a heterophonemic nature, will be treated when dealing with
the phonemes concerned. Any further morphophonemic implications
of a more specific nature will be indicated when the morphological
constructions concerned are dealt with. They are not so complicated
as to justify a separate section on morphophonemics. Since similar
phonetic phenomena occur in certain syntactic constructions, this
syntactophonemic aspect will be discussed in its proper place also
(see V. 3. 1).","[11, 12]"
"V.4.   Predicative constructions.
   There are four principal types of predicative constructions: (1) the
verbal, (2) the nominal (including pronominal), (3) the emphatic and
negative, and (4) the postpositional.
   The first type consists of an inflected verb form as predicate which
may itself express the subject or may be preceded by a separate word
as subject. The predicate may or may not be accompanied by one or
more attributes of V.7, types (8) and          (9) hereafter, the latter (the
object) as a rule intervening between subject and the predicate; e.g.,
ondofolo hadake, “the ondofolo (a clan chief) died”; Ajokoj anawole,
“A ate, was eating”; ka’ji nahi’bi duwawoke, “the (women’s) canoe
promptly sank”; bu na dilowfoke, “he dived off (over) into the water” ;
ko awajjajde, “they are all the time peeling the coconut’; J akalt
na-hu'we ajboke nej jo da, “they transported J. in the afternoon to his
(own) village”; duka aj-saba maj-saba ahabaj-je, “don’t throw stones
hither and thither” (lit. “...go-throwing come-throwing”); etc. The
subject may be stressed by the emphatic particle je, e.g., do je male,
“a man comes, it is a man who comes”; an no je dika na honole, “(it is)
a banana tree (that) is lying yonder”’ ; etc.
  The second type consists of a subject followed by a noun, adjective
(including the numerals) or pronoun as predicate; here too the predicate
may be accompanied by an attribute (including paratactical appositions),
eg., da do Dajma,      “my name       (is) D.”; ime kabam,     “the house (is)
big”; ondofolo fa be, “the ondofolo’s children (are) two”, 1.e., “the o.
has two children” ; daka nej, “this (is) his”; bele hina?, “that (is) who?,
who is that?’;     daka maka?,      “this (is) what?”;   wa   fa amba?,   “your
child (is) where (or which)?;        bele naje, “that (is) he, there he is”.
Here the predicate may be emphasized by the particle je, eg., na ahaw
we, “he (was) far away”; etc. The predicate has an attribute in examples
such as ondofolo do hokolo, “the o. (is) a young man” ; da ondofolo fa,
“T (am) an ondofolo’s child” ; ime kaban sala, “the house (is) very big”
(for *kabam hala); daka hina le habakaj, “this (is) whose tobacco?” ;
dika maka mej?, “this (is) for what purpose, what is this for?” ; daka
dej mej habakaj,    “this is my tobacco, the tobacco for me”;         dey heke
ambaj, “mine (is) one garden, I have a certain garden”; amba naje
wa fa, “where (or which) (is) he your child, where, which is your
54                   GRAMMAR      OF   THE   SENTANI   LANGUAGE
child” (in which the paratactical combination “he + your child” forms
the predicate) ; etc.
     The third type of predicative construction consists of a subject only
followed by the emphatic particle je or the negative bam, “not, hardly”.
The former is practically limited to such expressions as naje je (often
pronounced nije je), “that’s him, that’s it, there it is”; bam occurs in
sentence phrases like do bam, “(there is) nobody” (lit. “no man’);
aha bul bam, “(there is) not a thing” (lit. “thing sort not”) ; etc.
   In the fourth and last type of predicative construction the predicate
following the subject is a postpositional phrase and hence consists of
at least two words, e.g., bele ime hina le, “that house (is) whose?” ;
wa amba da, “thou (goest) whither?”; daje Ohe7j jo da, “I (go) to
Ohej village’; daka maka da, “this (is) for what?”’; meka kendo na,
“my elder brother is doing his needs” (lit. “(is) in defecation’’); naje

            in secondary    forms.
   According to the position the object affixes occupy in the verbal
structure, three main types can be distinguished:
(1) the iterative (secondary habitualis) places all person object affixes
after the tense sign -ja-, and, as the case may be, after the subject
affix or in the ending, entirely in the same manner as the primary
habitualis ;
(2) the adhortative and the conditional place all person object affixes,
and the tenses of the indicative, except the iterative, place the 1** and
3™ p.s., du., pl. object affixes, immediately before the aspect affix ;
(3) the indicative, except the iterative, is irregular as to the position
of the object affixes of the 2"" p.s.,du., pl., for which the following
peculiarities should be noted:
   The affix is usually, though not always, placed at once before the
aspect affix and between the subject affix and the mood sign in the
ending,     according    to the   rules   stated   above     for   the   2™   p.s., du., pl.
object affixes in primary forms. It is thus indicated twice in the verbal

 34                  GRAMMAR    OF    THE   SENTANI    LANGUAGE
structure, but with this additional peculiarity that the 2™ p.s. has always
-w- before the aspect affix even if it has -j- before the mood sign, while
the 2"" p. du. has in the plural forms of the subject the plural form -m-
before the aspect affix even if it has its normal -b- in the ending. The
2"" p.pl. is regular in having only -m- in both positions. Sometimes,
however, the shorter, more regular, form with only the object affix
inserted before the aspect affix is also found side by side with the
longer form. This is even normal for the 2™ p.s. obj. aff. in the future,
the 2"" p.du. and pl. being entirely similar to each other (-m--mbe).
   Otherwise the forms of the object affixes are the same as those in
primary forms, but in the 1** p.du. subject of the future and the
adhortative the 3"" p. object affixes are -nan- (or, through assimilation,
-nam-) for the singular, and -mim- (or, through assimilation, -min-)
for the dual and plural, while the 2"" p. du., pl. object affix is -mam-.
   The vowels are even more unstable than they are in primary forms.
Being non-distinctive, except for the 3"" p. du., pl., their type is more
or less free, but influenced by environment, viz. the vowels of neigh-
bouring syllables and/or the position of the stress. As in primary forms,
the vowels may precede or follow the consonant, or, in some cases
already referred to, stand between the doubled consonants. Examples:
how-na-bo-ke, but by preference how-no-bo-ke,                  “he slew (something)
for him”    or “he slew him”;        ho-no-bo-be,     but    also ho-na-bo-be,    “you
two will slay (something for) him” (future) ; but always hoj-no-bo, “kill
thou (something for) him!” (because of the stress on -no-); ha-nam-
bom, “we two must kill (something for) him”; and regularly hojboja-
na-le, “I use to kill (something) for him every time” (iterative), and
hojboj-an-e, id. 2"" p.s.; but with normal indifferent vowel a: hojbojow-
na, id. 3° p.s.; etc.
   The “actual” forms of the 1°‘ p. du. and pl. subject affixes show the
-an- and -an- allomorphs when taking the 3° p.s., du. and pl. object
affixes, but the -a- and -a- plus juncture consonant j when taking
the 2™ p.s., du. and pl. object affixes. The -an- and -an- forms may,
but need not, assimilate to the m of the 3° p. du., pl. object affix -mi-
in the same manner as in primary forms (cf. III. 4. 7).
   Examples: habaw-do-ko-ke, “he has beaten me” (aor. with asp. aff.
-ko-); how-no-bo-ke, “thou hast killed (for) him” (aor. with asp. aff.
-bo-);   (bana)   nakaw-na-ma-ke,       (a thought)         came   to dwell   on him”
(aor. with asp. aff. -ma-) ; bodo-j-mi-bo-j-me, “shouldst thou hear them”
(condit. with -bo-) ; bodo-naj-mo-bo-n-de, “they will hear us” (future) ;
ha-nam-bo-nde, “we two shall slay (for) him” (for *-nan-) ; haba-min-

ko-m, “let us two beat them” (for *-mim- before asp. aff. -ko-);
habaw-ko-k-a-wa-le, “I have hit thee” (aor. with -ko-); habaw-ko-k-

also “‘they-pl.”) have hit you two” (with -m- > -n- [n] before asp. aff.
-ko-, and -b- before mood ending: *-b-be > -be); but haba-ko-k-a-ba-le,
“I have hit you two” (with only -b- before mood ending) ; and hab-aj-
an-ko-k-am-be, “we (pl.) (but also “they-pl.”) have hit you (pl.)” (with
-m- before both asp. aff. and mood ending; -m- > -n- [nf] before -k-) ;

before the aspect affix: hab-aj-an-ko-k-e, “id.”.","[41, 42, 43]"
"V.6.   Coordination of words.
   The coordinative combination of words to phrases can be realized
either by mere juxtaposition, i.e., without coordinator ; or — in nominal
constructions only — by the usually, but not necessarily, repeated post-
position de ~ le or — more emphatic — jele, “with”; or again by be,
“two, both’’, placed after the second constituent, if there are two. E.g.,
foke hoje, “thou wentst (and) thou killst, i.¢., thou wentst to kill” ;
fokajde molajkoke, “they (pl.) went (and) buried”; ake kolukawna,
“she went (and) held him”; fi ukake kajewkoke nawole, “he chopped
the sago, cleft (it), (and) picked (it out)”;19          aj-saba maj-saba,      “go-
throwing   (and)   come-throwing,       7.e., throwing   thither    (and)   throwing
hither”; kalu omi, “son(s) (and) daughter(s)”; aka beka, “kith (and)
kin”; do mije, “man (or men) and woman (or women)” (but see for
other possibilities of this combination, III. 2.2); Sbaw de Nakahabo
le, “the Tortoise and the Lobster”; Jakali le Ajokoj de, “J. and A.”;
do jele mije jele, “man and woman, husband and wife’; (obo) bum
mele jahi jele,    “(pigs)   fat and    round”;    SAbala   Jakal     Hubulew     be,
“both Jakali of Abala (and) Hubulew”’; etc.
   As a specific syntactic type of word coordination must be regarded
word repetition, syntactical repetition, that is, as distinct from mor-
phological, both derivational and flexional, repetition (cf. III. 1, III. 2,
and III. 2.2). The two constituents are quite identical both in form
(in the case of verbs in fully inflected form) and in meaning, nor is the
meaning of the combination essentially changed, apart from being
repetitive or frequentative; e.g., ja ja, “day (and) day, day (after) day,
daily”; doko doko, “again (and) again”; fole fole, “he goes on (and)
on”; anke anke (for anake anake), “he ate (and) ate, had eaten (and)
eaten; awkajde awkajde, “the two (had) paddled (and) paddled”;19 Since a one word inflected verb form may also constitute a phrase, some of
   these verbal examples can also in a way be regarded as examples of phrase
   coordination.

honkawna        honkawna,       “he    burnt      him        (and)   burnt     him’;   etc.    The
repeated form may be stressed by the emphatic particle je, eg., Dajma
hu je hu je ja je ja je honowake, “D. remained lying day after day”
(it. “sun (and) sun, day (and) day’); mala doko je doko je okowoke,
“again (and) again he poured out the (sago) pith’ ; etc.
   Another specific type of serial coordination is represented by those
“numerals” which are partly syntactical constructions (cf. ITI. 2. 1);
eg., mahina be, “7”; mahina name, “8”; mahina kali, “9”. For the
fully syntactical “numerals”, see V. 8.","[63, 64]"
"   Flexion         is limited      to the verb,   the    personal   pronouns,     and   a few
 near relationship terms. Of these the flexion of the verb is by very
 far the most important. The term “flexion” for pronouns and relation-
 ship words is a somewhat big name, although justified, for a very
 limited number of special forms.
    The flexion of the verb includes the processes mentioned in III. 1
 under      nos.    1, 2,   5-7,    while    pronouns    and   relationship     terms   follow

inhabiting the Sentani Lake district in north-eastern West New Guinea.
Roughly three principal dialects can be distinguished : an eastern dialect,
chiefly including the villages of Buaj (wulgo: Puai), Sjafo (vulgo:
Ajapo) and Ohej (vulgo: Asei); a central dialect including the villages
of the central area of the lake from Noadali (vulgo: Netaar) as far west
as the western end of the strait of Fomfolo (vulgo: Simporo), and
a western dialect including the region to the west of this strait. Smaller
differences of dialect exist between the various villages within each
area. This grammar is concerned with the eastern dialect, more
particularly that of 3 jafo.
   The Sentani language is one of a group of closely related Papuan
languages, which I have named the Sentani group, and which includes
Sentani proper in the Sentani Lake district, the language of Nafri on
the Jotefa Bay to the east, and the language of Tanah Merah on the
bay of that name to the west. It appears to be more or less distantly
related to the Demta language to the west of Tanah Merah, which
occupies only a small area, but seems to constitute a group by itself.
Both the Sentani group and Demta seem to belong to a much larger
supergroup of distantly related groups of languages, which I have
named the “North Papuan phylum”, and whose nearest neighbour to
Sentani is the Nimboran language group. The exact nature of the
relations involved in this phylum, and the position of each group, and
notably of Sentani, within it, are, however, still very unclear.2

"III. 4.9.   Composite   verbal forms.
   Composite verbal forms, i.e., verbal forms composed of two differently
inflected roots, the first of which indicates a movement (cf. III. 4), are
found in various combinations. These are:
(1) both verbs are in the present ;
(2) both verbs are in the habitualis, the second verb being either a
primary or a secondary form;               .
(3)    the first verb is in the imperfect and the second in the aorist, this
second verb being either primary or secondary;
(4) the first verb is in the aorist and the second in the present;
(5) the first verb is in the aorist and the second in the imperfect;
(6) the first verb is in the aorist and the second in the aorist of
secondary form with directive aspect affix ;
(7) both verbs are in the future, the second being either a primary
or a secondary form;
(8) the first verb is in the adhortative and the second either in simple
root-form (with only the 1** p.s., du., pl. extended with the usual -m),
or in secondary form.
   Structurally two principal categories can be distinguished in these
combinations :
   (I) the first verb is in an imperfective or undeterminate form,
followed by the second verb in a perfective or determinate form, except
the secondary habitualis or iterative of type (2), which, though deter-
minate, follows category (IT);
   (II) all other combinations, with the exception of combination
type (7) (both constituents in the future), which, although the primary
future is more or less indifferent to aspect, always follows category (1),
36                 GRAMMAR    OF THE   SENTANI   LANGUAGE
and combination type (8) (adhortative) which also follows category (I),
but with some peculiarities of its own, particularly if the second con-
stituent is a secondary form.
    In other words: in category (I) belong only the types (3), (7) and (8),
in category (II) all the other types.
    The characteristic difference in structure between the two categories
is the following:
    In category (II) the 2™ constituent of the compound is fully inflected
according to mood, tense and person for the subject concerned as
primary or secondary form, as the case may be, while the only flexional
affixes occurring in the 1°‘ constituent are those for tense and person
for the subject, these latter being the “actual” forms of III. 4.5, with
the following exceptions: In type (4), (5) and (6) the 2""* p.s. has been
reduced to -a-, and the 3"" p.s. may have either -a- (a morphophonemic
variant of zero) or -w- (-aw-); in type (1) the 3"" p.s. has only -w-;
and in type (2) the only flexional affix appearing in the first verb is
throughout the -j- which is characteristic of the habitualis.
    In category (I) the 2"" constituent of the compound has exactly the
same flexional affixes as those following the aspect affix in non-com-
posite secondary forms of the corresponding tenses and moods (see
III. 4. 6). This means that (a) if the second constituent of the compound
is in the aorist (type 3), the singular persons are inflected fully in the
regular manner (-k-a-le, -k-e, -k-e), but the dual and plural persons
all have the one characteristic form in -ke similar to that of the 3"" p.s.;
that (b) if the 2"" constituent is in the future (type 7), only the 2” p. du.
and pl. have the regular endings (-be, -mbe) but all the other persons
have the constant form in -n-de similar to the 3"" p.s. (m for the future
and -de for the indicative); and that (c) if the compound is in the
adhortative (type 8), an additional -m follows, in the 1*° p.s., du., pL,
the second (root-form) constituent. If, however, the 2™ constituent is
a secondary form, the -m follows the aspect affix with optional pleo-
nastic addition after the 2“ constituent, whereas then a similar repetition
of the person affix of the first constituent is found in the 2™ and 3” p.s.
   The flexional elements in the first constituent of such compounds
of category (I) also are in accordance with those which, in the corre-
sponding tenses and moods of non-composite secondary forms, follow
the root and precede the aspect affix; with the following exceptions:
In type (3) the 1*° p.d., pl. have the regular -an- and -an- forms
respectively, in conformity with the normal “actual” flexion, as against
the forms -anda- and -anda- which we have found in the non-composite
                                 MORPHOLOGY                                  37
secondary aorist (see III. 4.6). In the adhortative (type 8) the 3™ p.s.
has -an- like the future instead of the normal -w-.
   There is thus a strong resemblance between the last-mentioned com-
pounds and the corresponding non-composite secondary forms. The
differences are only few, as we have seen. Also a similar morpho-
phonemic rule, as valid for the juncture between an aspect affix begin-
ning with a vowel and a preceding flexional element ending in a vowel
in secondary forms (cf. III. 4.4), applies to the composite forms: if
the second constituent of the compound begins with a vowel and the
preceding flexional element of the first constituent ends in a vowel,
the two vowels are not contracted or assimilated but linked by -j-, eg.,
ma-j-ana-n-ko-n-de, “we two shall come-eat” (1°* p. du. fut. of ma-,
“come”, plus ana- with asp. aff. -ko-, “eat”; type 7). But we have also
seen (cf. note 10 supra), that there are several good structural objec-
tions to regarding these compounds and the non-composite secondary
forms as similar formations, at least synchronically; historically, of
course, they may well be of similar origin.
   Examples: (type 1) a-j-ko-j-e, “thou goest-doest” (roots a-, “go”? +
ko-, “do, act”); a-j-ko-j-de, id. 3°* p. du.; an-k-an-de, id. 1** p. pl. (for
*5-an-ko-an-de) ; (type 2) a-j-a-j-nu-ja-je, “thou always goest-behavest

nuw-bo-jo-le, “he always goes-sits (rests)” (roots a- +- nuwa-, “rest”? ++
asp. aff. -bo- and habit. -ja-); (type 3) a-w-fada-ke, “he was going-died

"   While   the    Sentani    word,        whose   structure   was   dealt   with   in   the
chapters on phonology and morphology, is a minimum free form, the
sentence is the maximum free form of an utterance which is a gram-
matical unit. It stands in absolute position and is not included in a
longer grammatical form. The sentence contains one or more phrases,
free forms in included position which in their turn consist of one or
more words. An example of a sentence which is at the same time
 a phrase and a word, is, e.g., hadake, “he (has) died” (3™ p.s. primary
 aorist of hada-). An example of a two-word phrase which is not a
 sentence, is, eg., ime kabam, “the (or a) big house”. But this same
 form can, with or without a slight pause between the two words, also
 mean “the house is big”, and then we have an example of a two-word
 phrase which is at once a sentence. A sentence which contains more
  52                    GRAMMAR    OF    THE   SENTANI   LANGUAGE
 than one phrase is, e.g., ka’jt Rabam nahi'bi duwawoke, “the big canoe
 promptly sank”, in which ka’jt kabam, “the big canoe”, and nahi’bi
 duwawoke, “promptly sank”, are both two-word phrases.
    In the following sections we shall discuss our subject on the basis
 of the phrase only, in its occurrence both as or in a sentence and as
 a lesser free form.","[59, 60]"
"   Person for the subject in secondary forms is indicated in different
ways    according         to tense or, as the case may                  be, mood;       and, for each
tense or mood, according to person and/or number.
   In the secondary habitualis or iterative the position of the person
subject affix is regular throughout, following the tense affix and
preceding the mood sign. In the aorist and in the conditional the
indication of person for the subject differs according to number, the
affix following the tense sign in the regular manner of III. 4,3 in
the singular, but following the root and preceding the aspect affix
in the dual and plural. In addition, in the singular persons of the aorist
a -w- immediately follows the root and precedes the aspect affix, the
dual and plural having, like the 3"" p.s., throughout the ending -ke
following the aspect affix. However, the 3"" p. du. and pl. have a
younger, more regular, form besides, in which the regular endings
-aj-de and -aj-de are added pleonastically after the tense sign -ka-,
thus: -k-aj-de, -k-aj-de. This -w- may be a syllable-final allomorph
and perhaps even a phonetic derivative of the / of the indicative sign -le.
The ending -ke is the contraction of tense and mood signs (< *-k (a)-le),
already mentioned in III. 4.2. The singular persons of the conditional
have -j- immediately following the root in the 1** and 2™ p.s., and -w-
in the 3™ p.s., the dual and plural having, like the 3° p.s., throughout
the final -be, as described in III. 4.2. In the 1° p.du. and pl. both
aorist and conditional have -anda- and -anda- respectively instead of
 the “actual” -an- and -an-. With the forementioned restrictions and
 exceptions,        the    personal      affixes      of aorist     and      conditional     otherwise
 correspond         to the    “actual”        and     “eventual”         forms      of the preceding

 and precedes the aspect affix, the secondary future tense sign , imme-
 diately followed by the indicative mood affix le ~ de ~ be, occurring
 in final position in all persons except the 2"" p.du. and pl. In these
 persons the subject affix is found after the aspect affix and preceding
 the tense affix (*b-be > be in the dual and m-be in the plural), but
 in the 2"" p. pl. in addition to the post-radical position (*-am-ko-m-be
 > -an-ko-m-be). Hence in the secondary future all persons, except the
 two just mentioned, end, like the 3"" p.s., in asp. aff. + -nde, while in
 the secondary aorist all persons except the 1*t and 2™ p.s. end, like the
 3"" p.s., in asp. aff. + -ke, and in the conditional in asp. aff. + -be.
 The personal affixes of the secondary future correspond to the “even-
tual” forms, but in the 2"" p.s. the allomorph -w- of gero is used. For the
1* ps. -da- a variant -do- occurs when surrounding affixes have o-
vowels, but it is not obligatory.
   In the secondary adhortative the same principle prevails as in the
secondary future, the person affixes, which follow the root and precede
the aspect affix, corresponding to the “eventual” forms, series II (b),
except for the       1*' p.s., du., pl., which      have    an additional     m     following
the aspect affix, and the 2"" p.du. which has zero instead of -bu (or
perhaps loss of b before the consonant of the aspect affix).

" Ill. 4.10.   Indication   of the personal   object in composite     forms.
     If the composite form takes a personal object affix, it may have
 various positions in the structure according to whether the form is one
 of category (I) or category (II), and, in the former case, whether the
 second constituent of the compound is a primary or a secondary form.
 (a) If the compound is one of category (I), the object affix is treated
 in the same manner as it is in non-composite secondary forms, as if
 the first constituent were the verbal root and the second constituent the
 aspect affix (cf. IIT. 4. 8).
 (b) If, however, the second constituent of such a category (I) com-
 pound is a secondary form, the object affix may be placed either as
 described in (a) supra — and this by preference —, or both as in (a)
and again in the second constituent at the same time, which latter is
then fully inflected as a non-composite secondary form with an. object
affix. The object affix thus may occur twice in the compound.
 (c) If the composite form is one of category (II), the object affix is
placed in the second constituent according to the rules of the corres-
ponding non-composite forms, although sometimes here too the double
indication is found — incorrectly, as one of my informants said — if
the second constituent is a secondary form.

"   Words derived by repetition (derivational repetition as distinct from
flexional repetition) are usually adjectives and adverbs, which seem
to imply an intensive or excessive quality. They have the characteristics
of a single     unit,   both    in stress    and   in   meaning,   which   latter   is an
independent, if derived, one of their own; e.g., kalan-kalam, “dry” ;
kani-kani, kankam, “torn to shreds” ; hale-hale, “thin” ; dun-dum, “fat” ;
waw-waw, “deep” ; (west. dial.) nima-nima, “red” (cf. nima, “ripe”) ; etc.
   Sometimes they seem to be derived from nouns, to which the specific
12                      GRAMMAR      OF    THE   SENTANI   LANGUAGE
quality is attributed in particular, e.g., duka-duka, “thick, massive” (cf.
duka, “stone”); foma-foma, “light (not heavy)” (cf. foma, “coconut
rat”, a very light animal); bobo, “hard” (cf. bo, “bone’’) ; etc.
   Rarer is repetition in nouns; no specific meaning of the simple root
can be recognized; e.g., (odo) kala-ka’la, “toe” (odo = “foot”’); (ka’na)
kon-kom, “spittle, phlegm, gob” (cf. ka’na, “heart, pith’); etc.
   A variant of this type of derivation is repetition with vowel or even
syllable variation (apophony) in the 2° constituent, eg. dawbahi-
dawbahi, “one side (and) the other, here and there, hither and thither”
(cf. ahi, “other”); kew-kaw, “broad, wide”; ama-foma, “entire(ly),
total(ly)”;     htkoj-sakoj,    “exhausted,          tired”;    adaj-madaj,     “invisible,
unseen” (cf. ada-, “see”, and negative prefix a- ?); etc.","[19, 20]"
"    The Sentani vowel system is as follows:                            Front   -                       —   Back
                   High        i                                  u

the consonants, are generally slight. They are mostly limited to minor
 differences in length and/or tenseness (narrowness) of articulation,
those in stressed open syllables being pronounced longer and more
tensely than those in closed or unstressed open syllables. In the case
of /o/, which is a mid back vowel, this goes parallel with a variation
between higher and lower positions, and for /a/, a mid indifferent
vowel, between [6] and [a] types respectively.3 3 There are indications that, from a historico-structural point of view, the /a/
   phoneme has originally filled, in a different phonetic form, the empty place
   now existing in the mid-back vowel sequence if compared with the mid-front

   /a/, though shown as a low indifferent vowel, is usually pronounced
frontally rather than backwardly.
   In open accentuated syllables of words of more than one syllable
/i/ is often lengthened to such an extent that it even tends to diph-
thongize to [ij], which in an extreme type of articulation sometimes
even becomes [i&] in conformity with the fact that /j/ after /j/ or /i/
is frequently pronounced in its non-distinctive variant [g], e.g. wne,
“house”      [ime, ijme, igme].
   Nasalized vowels sometimes occur as non-distinctive variants of
vowel followed by syllable final nasal, notably before /k/, more rarely
before [s]. Sometimes the nasalization is dropped or almost dropped
and the vowel at the same time slightly lengthened. This lengthening
is no more phonemic than the one mentioned before, since the relevant
feature in question is not long vowel as opposed to short vowel, but
vowel -++ nasal (with variants) as opposed to simple non-nasalized vowel.
E.g., awbaNka           [awbanks, awbako,                 awba:ka],     “cassowary”;       HaNsa
[hanso,     hanso,    haso,      ha:so],         proper    name     (from    Dutch    Hans);          etc.
   The following examples show the vowels in                                  their   phonological
oppositions to each other:
   a, “voice” : 0, “wood” : u, “body” : i, “fire”;
   fa, “child” : fe, “leaf” : ft, “sago” : fa, “fear”;
   ake, “he went (aorist)” : ake, “thou wentst” ;
   me, “we”      : me, “our(s)” : ma, “hand”                     : mi, “louse” : mu, “penis” :
mo, “just, only” ;
   ju, “sugar cane” : jo, “village” : je, emphatic particle : ja,                                   “fire-

6                      GRAMMAR     OF   THE   SENTANI   LANGUAGE   The plosives /b/ and /d/ are unvoiced lenes, respectively bilabial
and gingival, but free non-distinctive variants include unvoiced and
voiced types.4 An extreme unvoiced combinatory variant of /d/ is
palatalized [t’] which occurs in contact with /i/, /j/, /u/ and /w/.
Via a voiced allophone of /d/ there is sometimes neutralization of the
opposition between this phoneme and /1/ in intervocalic position, e.g.,
ambulo, “dead (man’s) body” (for *ambu-do, from do, “man”; cf.
ambomije, “dead (woman’s) body”); kilo, “new-born (male) child”
(for *kido, cf. kimije, “new-born (female) babe”). The phonological
opposition between /d/ and /l/ is otherwise shown by such pairs as
odo     : olo and ada-    : ala-, mentioned at the end of this section.
   /k/ is a voiceless velar plosive whose allophones include uvular [q]
on the one, and palatal [k] on the other hand, as well as velar fricative              _
[x]. These allophones are generally speaking free; naturally contact
will have its influence, but it is not decisive, and both the uvular and
velar types and the palatal will be heard in contact with front as well
as back vowels.
   The fricative /f{/ has labiodental and bilabial allophones. Through
the former the phonological opposition with /h ~ s/ is neutralized under
certain combinatory conditions, [f, h, s] then varying heterophonemically
according to the nature of the contact phonemes (see II. 1. supra).
   The laryngeal fricative /h/ has a bound allophone [s] which is
restricted to, and — except after /w/ — obligatory in, the position
following /i/ or one of the only admissible syllable- and word-closing
consonants, viz. the semivowels and N (the latter then appearing as 7).
Although it is non-distinctive, we shall write this s where it belongs
because of its obligatory and phonetically deviating nature. E.g., ssam,
“anger”; honsom reduplicated root-form (gerund) of hon(a)-, “burn” ;
kejsi, “throw away!” (2 p.s. imperat.); Rkensi, “id.” (2 p.p.); but
kejnaht [kejfiohi] (with pron. obj. aff. 3 p.s.); balaw-sabakaj (for
*bglaw-habakaj), “betelnut (and) tobacco”, i.e. “betel-quid” ; etc. Under
certain conditions, already referred to above, this [s] may, after semi-
vowel /w/, interchange with labiodental [f], thereby neutralizing the
    4 In the western dialect phonemic distinctions seem to be between /b/ and /d/
      on the one hand and slightly aspirated /p/ and /t/ on the other. Comparison
      shows that these /b/ and /d/ correspond to /b/ and /d/ in our eastern dialect,
      while /p/ corresponds to /f/ and /t/ to /h/.
                                           PHONOLOGY                                            7opposition with /f/;5 eg., kewsike or kewfike (aorist 3 p.s.), but
never *kewhike.
   The nasals are neutralized in final position, which neutralization
can be symbolized by N, realized as [m, n] or [n] according to the
following consonant in the word or in phrase sandhi. But in pausal
and non-assimilating positions, e.g., before vowel of a following word
or in slow speech, m is “preferred” as word-final, dialectally, notably
in the western dialect, also [nm]. Therefore we shall in final position
write    m    instead    of N.    On     the other      hand   we    shall   not,   for   obvious
reasons, write [n] nor [fi], which allophones occur before /k/ and
before and after /i/ and /j/, respectively. E.g., am (western dialect
an), “banana” : am fe, “banana leaf”, but an no, “banana treetrunk” ;
ahamam, “food”, ahamam anake, “he ate food”, but ahaman da, “for
food”;       honaj,     “burn!”       (2 p.s.   imperat.),     but    honsom,       “burning” ;
mandilim, “cold” : mandilin na or mandilim ma, “in cold, for cold” ; etc.
   The voiced lateral in gingival position /1/ is apical, but the tongue
tip is allowed little more than a minute and momentary touch against
the upper gums. This may explain why there is the neutralization
with /d/ already referred to. It probably also explains why non-natives
often hear and reproduce it as r. In the western dialect it actually is a
tongue flip rather than a lateral. E.g., (odo) halam (w.dial. odo taran),
“knee”; (odo) ka’la-ka’la (w.dial. odo kaka’ra), “toe”; malem (w.dial.
maren), “meat, flesh” ; etc. This phoneme only occurs intervocally and
never as word-initial nor after consonant. In the latter two positions
it is represented by /d/ as bound and obligatory heterophonemic variant.
An apparent exception to this rule is word-initial / in the postposition
lew de, “with, and”. But this being enclitic to the preceding word,
it is not really an exception, for it occurs only after words ending in
a vowel,       while    de   occurs     after   words     ending     in   a consonant;       eg.,
baw          de Nakahabo      le, “(and) the Tortoise and the Lobster”; Jakali
le Ajokoj de, “(and) J. and A.” etc.
   /w/ is a strongly rounded bilabial semivowel. There are reasons to
believe that it is a comparatively recent phonemicization of a non-
syllabic allophone of an original sonant /u/. Its functional yield as® In the western dialect /h/ does not exist. Our /h/ corresponds to /s/ in that
  dialect in so far as it does not represent /t/ in the latter (cf. the preceding
  note). In the Nafri and Tanah Merah languages (see I.2) /s/ represents
  our eastern /h/ both where it corresponds to west /s/ and to west /t/. These
  facts and those mentioned in the foregoing note, together with dialectal inter-
  mixing, may probably account for the neutralization phenomena described
  in IJ. 1, and here.
 8                      GRAMMAR     OF THE   SENTANI    LANGUAGE
 phoneme, distinct from /u/, is small. We have little more than the
 following evidence: wi, “river” : uj, “arrow”; central dial. ’wa, ’uwa,
 “body” (east. dial. u) : wa, “skin”; huw- = huwa-, verbal root of
 “feel”      (cf. a-huw-boj,     “not feel”) : hu,     “sun”;   duw-= duwa-,            root
 of “fall” (cf. duwke,         “he fell”): du, “breadfruit tree”; and this same
 word     duwke     in similar    surroundings   as    duka,    “stone”;   etc.   But     wi
 could be an Austronesian loanword (cf. AUN *wayay), which in a
 number of Melanesian languages occurs as wat or vat. And ua, uwa
 belongs in another dialect. The other examples are not, strictly speaking,
 minimal pairs. I have never come across a pair such as, e.g., *wu : *uw.
 And initial syllable wa- in polysyllables frequently contracts to u-, uw-.
 Yet, originally an Austronesian loanword or not, wi is a good Sentani
 word, and clearly contrasts with uj. And the additional evidence, how-
 ever weak, also points to /w/ as a separate phoneme now.
    Similar considerations, mutatis mutandis, apply for /j/ as distinct
 from /i/. The same minimal pair uj : wi again is our main evidence.
 No pair *ji : *i7 has been found. But we may contrast ji in ka’ji, “big
canoe for women and children”, with ij in ijke = ike (for jeke), “he
 climbed”, and similar ij variants of i in open stressed syllables (cf. IT. 2).
 This phoneme has a non-distinctive variant [%] occurring after /j/,
 sometimes also after /w/, and often after /i/ in its lengthened and
 diphthongized variant [ij], which then often sounds like [ig]; eg.,
 awajjajde [awojgajde], “they are rowing all the time” (with -ja- of
 habitualis following stem in -j-); ahoj-je [ahoj-ge], “do not kill!’;
 Ohej jo [ohej-go], “the village Ohej” ; ime [ime, ijme, igme], “house”.

    obo, “pig” : odo, “foot” : olo, “empty” : oko, “moon” : ojo, “de-
 scend”’ ;

   Jakali of Sbalo (village) and Ajokoj [and].
   Jakali of Sbalo (village) came from Buwaj village, (and) he came
(and) stayed in Ohej village. He (was) the grown-up sister’s child (of
Dasim Kalawbew).22 Once upon a time his mother’s brother told-him
to go over (and) cut (litt., he-will-go-over, will-cut) for his uncle
jokoluwej falam (on) the shore of the village’s water-passage. Jakali
went, cut off the head of his uncle’s dog, loaded it (in a canoe), (and)
came-back (with it). He went over to his uncle, (and) says-to-him:
“Uncle, that dog’s head just mentioned              (is) there, I-have-cut-   (it-)
off, have-loaded (it), (and) come-back (with it), in the canoe.” Dasim
Kolowbew was (litt., became) startled : “Oh! how (is) that! Hondombi27
I-said-to-thee, thou (art) just a fool, a dog thou wentst (and) killst.”
Other men he-told [-them] (and) they-went-over (and) buried the dog.
    Another time his uncle says-to-him: “Go-over, thou-wilt-tear-off
banana leaf (and) wilt-bring (-it) -back.” Jakali went, cut (and) cut
a banana leaf to little bits (and) scraps (and) came-home (with them).
To his uncle he-says [-to-him]: “Uncle, that (is) that. banana leaf just
mentioned.” His uncle had hardly taken (it), (then) he felt the banana
leaf scraps. “This (is) for what?” Jakali says-to-him: “Uncle, that
banana leaf thou-saidst-to-me, that’s it”. — “Take (and) go-throw-it-
away in the water; (is) this (good) for tobacco (i.e., cigars) when
they-use-to-roll (it) ?”. Jakali went- (and-) threw-it-away.
    Because always-thus only he-acted-up-to-this-time, his uncle ordered
 [-them] (other) men (and) they-loaded sago (1.e., he ordered others
to load sago). (When) day had broken, he-went to the shore. They-
had-knocked (and) knocked sago, (when) Jakali feigned fever. Shrieks
only he-kept-on-shouting. (If) the people hold-him (by) the hand, he
(litt., his body) does-not-notice (it). He just continued-shouting shrieks.
Ajokoj, Dasim Kalawbew’s daughter, went (and) held-him, then only
(his) voice was-silent. Every time Ajokoj lets-him-loose, Jakali makes
a very loud uproar. Therefore Ajokoj continues-holding-him. That
way she just kept-on-doing.
    (When) they-had-gone-over to the village, Dasim says-to-them:
“Immediately take (and) bring-him-home.” Jakali and Ajokoj (and)
sat in her canoe. Ajokoj ate food in her canoe. In the evening they-27 Hondombi (dial.) = jokoluwej falam forementioned; see vocabulary s.v.
   jokoluwej. Jakali, who came from another village, did not, or acted as if he
   did not, understand his uncle’s words, and thought that joku falam, dog’s
   head, was: meant.

transported Jakali to his own village. Jakali in the middle of the water
continued-supporting-himself on Ajokoj’s hand (litt.: J.... with A’s
hand they-two-kept-supporting). (When) they-all-had-disembarked in
the village, they-two-went-down the house’s nibung-passage, (then)
suddenly Jakali embraced-her, shouting: “Hey (people of) 4 balo, (this
is) my wife, hey Sbaloans, my wife!” Ajokoj uttered a loud crying
and shrieking, a violent crying. The Ohej people went to Dasim
Kolowbew (and) say-to-him: “Thy daughter suddenly has-taken Jakali
for her [own] husband.” Jakali dealt-out-to-them traditional gifts, very
sufficiently he-gave-to-them. Dasim’s voice did-not-speak (1.¢., he was
silent). After all (Jakali was) only a nephew through (his) sister, in
that way (it was) just sufficient. (In) that same manner the two young
people became (and) remained husband and wife (and).","[78, 79, 80, 81]"
" 8 A much more regular occurrence of the indicative mood sign is found in the
   Nafri language, which is very instructive for the situation in Sentani too.
 9 This mood, or at least its 2! p.s. which is quite identical in the two languages,
   is used as a common imperative in Tanah Merah.

 In the 2"" p.s. it is m; in the 1** p.s. it seems to coincide with the
 indication of the person; e.g., a-le, “should I go, I would go”; a-j-me,
  “shouldst thou go”; a-w-be, “should he go”; and with asp. aff.
-(secondary forms): jej-bo-le, jejbo-j-me, and jewbo-be; and in the
 secondary plural: jendabo-be (1** p. du.) ; egbo-be (< *je-aj-) (3° p. pl.) ;
 etc., these secondary forms of the plural being formed after a similar
 structural model as the secondary aorist, the ending -be corresponding
 to -ke in the latter (see III. 4. 6).
     The sign of the negative is the prefix g- in combination with the
 affix (or root extension) -7. If the initial of the root is itself a, the
 prefix is either added by means of the junction consonant -j-, or it
 contracts with the a of the root which is then somewhat lengthened
 and takes the stress. The relevant element is this stress, not length.
 In secondary forms, the aspectual affix which follows the root extension
 -j-, is again followed by this element in addition. The negative thus
 formed, is not otherwise inflected; e.g., a-’ma-j, “not come”; a-haba-j,
“not hit”; but a-j-a-7, “not go”; a-j-ala-j, but also ’ala-7, “not speak”,
as opposed to a’/aj, “speak thou!” (adhort. 2 p.s.); da a-hojboj, “T do,
did, shall not kill (something)” ; na a-j-anajkoj, “he does, did, will not
eat (it); a-duwa-j-o-j,      “it does, did, will not fall down’;     etc.
   The vetative is only partly inflected, viz. for the 2"" p.s., du. and pl.
of the subject, but for all persons of the object. It is formed by prefixing
the same a- or a-j- to the 2™ p.s., or pl. of the adhortative, in com-
bination with the enclitic particle je, following the person affix and
assimilating to it retrogressively to -me after the -m of the 2™ p. du., pl.
(in the 2™ p.s. the resulting -7/- is usually pronounced -7g- in accordance
with what has been said in II.3 for /j/). In secondary forms, the
aspect affix, which follows the person affix, precedes the particle, but
the person affix intervenes again between aspect affix and _ particle.
Examples: a-ma-j-je, “do (sg.) not come!” a-ma-m-me,               “do (du., pl.)
not come!” ; a-7-ana-j-je,       “do not eat!” ; a-hoj-bo-j-je,   “do not kill’;
a-ho-m-bo-m-me, “id.” (du., pl.) ; ete.","[29, 30]"
"   The first grammatical description of the Sentani language was
published by this writer in Oceania, vols. XXI (1950-51), pp. 214-228
and 302-309; and XXII (1951-’52), pp. 53-71 and 315-316, under the
title of “Notes on Sentani Grammar”. It was the result of fieldwork
during my stay in West New Guinea in the years 1946-1950. As was
stated at the time in the introduction, this fieldwork could only be done
to the extent that official civil service duties permitted. But during
a further         term      of   service,   which   finally   ended   in    1956,   I had   the
opportunity of collecting more data concerning the language. This has
led to the present much more complete new grammar.
   The following texts have been published by the author before:
(1)     A-specimen text in the “Notes on Sentani Grammar” forementioned,
being a translation of part of the Story of the Prodigal Son, which is
now published in full in the present work ;
(2) “Een volksverhaal van het Sentanimeer” (in Bingkisan Budi, the
collection of papers by colleagues and former pupils of the late Professor
Ph. S. van Ronkel, presented to him at the occasion of his 80"" birthday
in 1950). This appeared before the “Notes” and was, for that reason,
provided with an extensive grammatical annotation as well as a
translation in Dutch. This text is reprinted in this book in a slightly
revised form;
(3)      “Drie verhalen in Sentani-taal” (in Bijdragen tot de Taal-, Land-
en Volkenkunde, 108, 1952). These texts too have been provided with
extensive notes as well as a translation, but reference was largely made
to the “Notes on Sentani Grammar”. A different version of the first
of these stories is included in the present work.",[9]
"III. 4.7.   Indication of person      (with number)         for the object
            in primary forms.
   The object in primary forms is indicated by person affixes which,
as a rule, follow in the verbal structure the person affix for the subject
and precede the affix for mood. This means that if the person subject
affix is zero, the object affix immediately follows the tense sign, and
if this is zero     tuo, the root.    If the     sign   for mood    is zero,       as in the
adhortative, the object affix naturally stands at the extreme end of the
verbal structure. The following peculiarities should, however, be noted.
                                   MORPHOLOGY                                    31
   In the 2"" p.s. subject form the object affix immediately precedes
the combined mood + subject person ending -e in those forms of the
indicative where this occurs (see III. 4. 2). In the 3"" p.s. subject form
the object affixes of the 1** and 3"" p.s.,du., pl. are in the indicative |
placed at the extreme end of the verbal structure, preceded by the -w-
allomorph of the 3"" p.s. “actual” for the subject (see III. 4. 5), the
mood sign being omitted altogether. Omission of this mood affix is
usual in the 2"" and 3"" p. du., pl. subject forms of the present and the
imperfect, if the object affix is in the 1** p.s.,du., pl. or in the 3"" p.s.,
du., pl.; but for the 3""     p. du., pl. object   forms   it is not   a strict rule
and these forms are found both with and without a final -Je for the
indicative mood.
  If the object affix is in the 2"" p.s.,du., pl. the preceding “actual”
subject affixes for the 1** p. du., pl. then have the allomorphs -a- and
-a- respectively linked with following vowel by -j- (see ITI. 4. 5), whence
the forms for these persons are wholly identical with the forms of the
3"" p.du., and pl. subject (which have -aj- and -aj- respectively). If
the object affix is in the 3"" p.du., pl. the n-element in the “actual”
forms -gn- and -an- of the 1** p.du.,pl. may assimilate to the object
affix mi to -mmi or may be separated from it by a, thus: -na-mi.
   In the adhortative the 1** p.s., du., pl. subject forms add the same
final -m after the object affix, as we also found added after the
aspectual affixes in secondary forms of the adhortative (cf. III. 4. 4),
and similarly the 2“ p.du. subject form has the same zero (or loss
of b) for the subject affix as we found in the secondary adhortative
(cf. ITI. 4. 6).
   In the singular of the conditional the object affix precedes the peculiar
forms of subject person + mood -le, -me, and -be of the 1**, 2"" and
3™ p.s. respectively (cf. ITI. 4. 2).
  The vetative lastly (the negative is, of course, uninflected here too),
shows the same extension of the object affix with an additional -m as
we have seen in the 1** ps.,du., pl. of the adhortative. As in the
adhortative the extended affix is placed after the subject affix for
the 2 p.s. (j) or pl. (m); the following emphatic particle je then
assimilates retrogressively to the -m-extension and becomes me.
   The object affixes are the following:
       Person              Singular               Dual                 Plural
        1**                   d                    m                     m

32                     GRAMMAR      OF   THE   SENTANI      LANGUAGE
   As has already been remarked in connection with the subject person
affixes (ITI. 4.5), these affixes show, at least partly, a distinct formal
relation with the “eventual” class of the subject affixes, and with the
independent personal pronouns.
   The distribution of the w and 7 allomorphs of the 2"" p.s. object is
as follows: -7- occurs in all forms where it precedes the mood affix
(which then has the allomorph -de), i.e., when the subject is in the
3” p.s., du., pl. or the 1** p. du., pl. of the present, the habitualis, the
imperfect and the aorist, in all persons of the future and in the 1** p.s.
of the conditional ; -w- occurs in the other forms, i.e. the small minority.
The 2” p. du. object affix only occurs if the subject is in the 1** or
3™ p. sg. of the indicative tenses, except the future (in the 3% ps.
-b- + mood affix -le >-be). In the 1** and 3°* p.du and pl. subject
forms of the indicative tenses just referred to, and in all persons of
the future, the adhortative and the conditional the 2™ p. pl. object
affix is used for the dual as well (-m- + mood affix > -mbe).
   Except for the 3"" p.du., pl., only the consonants are given in the
above table, because the vowels in the other persons are unstable and
non-distinctive.      The   i of   the   3°    p.du., pl.    -mi-,   however,     when     in
contact with a or ¢, or a syllable in a, assimilates, progressively or retro-
gressively, to ¢. Of the consonants the -- of the 3"" p.s. may assimilate
to m if followed by b. In the 1** p. du. of the future this 1 is repeated—
and becomes -nan-. In the 1** p.s. of the conditional the 2™ p.s. object
affix is also doubled and becomes -jaj- (if, at least, the first 7 is not
the juncture consonant).
   The vowel of the affixes, though unstable and non-distinctive, except
for the 3"" p. du., pl., is basically a, but assimilates to @ in contact with
a syllable containing a or ¢. Because of the limitations of consonant
clusters the vowel may precede or follow the consonant, dependent on
environment;       e.g., waw-na,     “he tells him’;         wa-n-an-de    (for *wa-an-
an-de), “we two tell him”; but w-a-na-le,                “I tell him’; w-an-s, “thou
tellst him” ; etc.
   For a complete conspectus of all possible formations we refer the
reader to the paradigmatic tables of chapter IV. Here we must content
ourselves with some examples for illustration: hab-a-le, “I strike, beat,
hit” ; hab-a-na-le,    “IT hit him”;     hab-ad-e,    “you     hit me”;   u-k-am-e       (for
wa-k-am-e),     “you    told us”     (aorist);     haba-w-am-e,        “thou    hast been
beating us” (imperfect) ; u-k-an-an-de, “we (pl.) told him”                    (aor.); wa-

(but also “they’”’) hit thee” (with 2"" ps. obj. aff. -j-); haba-w-a-ba-le,
“I have been hitting you two” (for *haba-wo-a-ba-le) ; haba-w-a-ma-le,
“T have been hitting you (pl.)”; haba-wo-j-am-be, “we two (but also
“they two”) have been beating you (pl.)” (for *haba-wo-a-am-be if the
1°* p. du. subj. is meant, and for *haba-wo-aj-am-be if the 3°? p. du. subj.
is meant); haba-w-aj-am-be, “we (pl.) (but also “they-pl.”) have been
beating you (pl.)” (for *haba-wo-a-am-be and *haba-wo-aj-am-be re-
spectively) ; hab-a-me-le, “I hit them” (for *haba-a-mi-le) ; hab-aj-mi-le
or habajmi, “they (pl.) hit them” (present) ; u-zo-j-mi-le or u-wo-j-mi,
“they two have been telling them” (imperfect) ; hab-am-mi-le, “we (pl.)
hit them” (for *-an-mi-) ; wa-j-na, “tell him thou!” (adhort.) ; wa-w-na,
“he must tell him”         (adhort.); but u-da-na-m or, contracted, u-da-m,
“let me tell him” (for *wa-da-na-m) ; w-a-na-m, “let us two tell him” ;
wa-na, “you two must tell him’; wa-n-na, “you (pl.) must tell him”
(for *wa-m-na); je-j-na-me, “shouldst thou give it to him” (condit.) ;
je-w-da-be, “should he give it to me” (condit.); a-wa-j-da-m-me, “do
thou not tell me!”       (vetative) (for *-da-m-je) ; a-wa-n-na-m-me,               “don’t
you (pl.) tell him” (for *a-wa-m-na-m-je) ; etc.","[38, 39, 40, 41]"
"II.4.1.    Stress.
   Stress in words of more than one syllable lies as a rule on the
syllabic preceding the last consonant of the word, eg., ‘ioku, “dog” ;
‘mije, “woman” ; ’kambi, “neck”; ho’kolo, “young”; mo’kodu, “back” ;
g’dake, “he saw” (aorist); ’hojbo, “kill!”; w’kawna, “he told him” ;
ma’kajde, “they came”; but: fa’lam, “head” ; e’mem, “sister-in-law
(husband’s sister)” ; an’kej, “ear” ; a’waw, “mother’s brother” ; haba’kay,
“tobacco”; holo’boj, “carrying net”; a’laj, “speak!” ; bo’doj, “hear!”                         ;
adi’laj, “collect!” ; a’dam, “see you (du., pl.)”; hodo’bom, “let me kill”.
   In words of 3 and 4 syllables, ending in a vowel, which have the
antepenult closed by a consonant, the stress tends to shift to this
syllable, if the penult is an open syllable in a, eg., ‘wawnale, “thou wilt
say to him’;         ’kejnahi,   “throw    it away”;      w’kajnale,     “they   (pl.) told
him”; but: how’boke, “he killed (something)” ; hoj’nobo, “kill some-
thing) for him”; handa’boke, “we (pl.) killed (something)” ; honam-
’bonde, “he will kill (something) for him”; etc. In longer words the
main, stress falls on the regular syllabic according to the basic rule
stated above, a secondary stress affecting the 3"" syllable forward from
the main stress, or the 2” syllable forward if this is closed by a con-
sonant, e.g., ha,bawdo’koke, “he hit me” (aor.) ; ha,bawnoko’kale, “T
struck him” (aor.) ; ha, bawkoka’wale, “I have struck thee” ; jadaka' wale,
“IT saw thee”; adiladami’him, “let me collect them” ; a,dilamihibe,
“you two will collect them”;              a,najna’wande,      “they (pl.) will go tell
 10                      GRAMMAR      OF     THE     SENTANI     LANGUAGE
him” ; a,najnaken’sinde, “they (pl.) will throw it away’; etc.
      Deviations   and   variations        from      the    above       rules    are,     however,     not
unfrequent. Verbal roots of more than one syllable ending in -a pre-
ceded by one of the consonants admissible as finals, tend to treat this
consonant as root final and drop the -a, when an affix, beginning with
a consonant,       follows.   The     stress       then     remains      on the         syllable,   which
would carry it in the root, eg. ana-, “eat” : ‘an(a)ke, “he ate’;
’an(a)ma > amma, “let us eat”; dowa-, “take” : ‘dow(a)ke, “he took” ;
duwa-, “fall” : ‘duw(a)ke, “he fell’; etc. But the stress shifts from
this root syllable to the affix (or one of the affixes if there are more),
in regular conformity with the basic rules stated above, if it ends in
a consonant itself, eg., a’naj, “eat!”; hon’kawna (for honakawna),
“he burnt him”, from hona-; honsom, “burning” (gerund; for hon(a)-
hon(a)); etc.
      Sometimes differences in stress exist between                       different dialects, eg.,
ka’jt, “big (women’s) canoe”, but ’kaji in the central dialect; ’hodo,
“throat”, but sa’to in Nafri and sa’so in Tanah Merah; etc.
   In some adjectives and adverbs stress is found on the final syllable,
even if this ends in a vowel, but it is doubtful whether this can be said
to be a characteristic feature for these word classes (cf. V. 8), eg.,
ha'le-ha’le, “thin” ; fe’ne, “slippery” ; a’ha, “heavy” (in the central dialect
in opposition to ’aha, “dung” = kendo in our dialect); wa’la-wa'la,
“quick(ly) ; nahu’we,         “in the evening(s)”              (cf. ’huwe,         “evening’”); etc.
      Sometimes,     however,       stress     has        distinctive      function,        eg.,    ‘kala,
“shellfish” (regular), but ka’la, “shout, yell” (irregular); a’laj, “speak
thou !” (regular),  but ’alaj, “not speak” (irregular) ; etc.
   But often irregularities in stress have no demonstrable distinctive
value    whatever,    e.g., i’fa,    “small        canoe     for men”;          w’ma,     “hair of the
head” ; fa’la, “bow-and-arrow” ; etc.6 We shall indicate such irregular-
ities of stress by a high dash preceding the stressed syllable (a low
dash means a secondary stress).","[17, 18]"

"V.7.1.   Subordination of phrases.
   As we have said, phrase coordination is usual, even where we would
have to translate with a subordinate phrase or clause (see V. 6. 1).
For clause subordination, however, there are other possibilities. In
subordinate clauses the postposition na ~ na may be used in the sense
of “when, if, as, for, since, because”. This meaning of the postposition
has already been noted in dealing with the postpositional phrase; here
follow some examples of full sentences: daje makale na (or na) naje
awake, “when I came he went away”; naje mande na daje adale, “when
(or if) he comes (Jit. “will come”), I shall go away”; na u kaban da
ake nakawole na, “as he went (and) lived in great style’; Jakali
dakakawna an na Hubulew bu moko da iwole, “since J. had not waited
for him, H. went up the open lake” (lit. the water’s mountain) (thus
in the version of this story published in the Bydragen, cf. the Introduc-
tion); but also Jakali Buki na dakakawna am, Hubulew...,              “(as) J.
had not waited for him in the Buki,      H....”     (without causal na; thus
in the version published in this book) ; etc.
   Conditional clauses can also, of course,       be subordinated by means

of the inflected verbal forms of the conditional, e.g., jej bi foma do da
mije da jejbojme dej na a wajajde bodojdobojme, “hey there! coconut
rat, if thou shouldst become man      (or) woman,   thou wouldst understand
my words (lit. voice) (that) I would say to thee’.","[68, 69]"
"       Phrases of one word may         consist of an inflected form, e.g., hadake,
 “he died”, or a root word, eg., ako!, “father, old man!”’; maka?,
 “what?’; nal, “yes!; nawa, “indeed! good!’”.
    Phrases of more than one word are formed by predicative, post-
 positional, coordinative, or subordinative (including appositional) com-
 bination of lesser free forms.",[60]
"   There are five moods: the indicative, with the uninflectable negative,
the imperative-adhortative (here named adhortative only), with the
vetative (limited to the 2"" p.s., du. and pl. as far as the subject is
concerned), and the conditional or optative (here named conditional).
   The sign of the indicative is -le ~~ -de~ -be, the morphophonemic
distribution of these three allomorphs over the various forms following
the obligatory “heterophonemic” variation in certain positions of /1/
and /d/ as far as the former two are concerned, while -be occurs after
labials (b, m and w, of which b + -be > -be). The modal sign follows,
generally speaking, the person subject affix and is the final element
in the verbal structure. However, in the 2 p.s. of the present, the
imperfect and the primary and secondary forms of the aorist and the

habitualis, as well as in the 2™ p.du. of the primary and secondary
forms of the future, the indicative mood sign coincides with the person
subject affix, (-j)-e and -be respectively. In the 2 p.s. of the primary
and secondary aorist, moreover, the combined mood -++ person ending
contracts with the tense affix to -ke. In the 3"" p.s. of the primary
aorist and in all persons, except the 1° and 2™ p.s., of the secondary
aorist, the modal sign coalesces with the tense affix to -ke, but perhaps
reappears as -w- in the singular persons of the secondary aorist between
root and aspect affix (see IIT. 4. 6). For the morphophonemic rules of the
indicative sign in contact with object affixes, see otherwise II. 4. 7.8
  Examples for primary forms : ma-le, “I come” ; ma-j-e, “thou comest”’ ;
maka-le, “I came” (aorist); mak-e, “thou camest”; mak-e, “he came” ;
but uka-w-na, “he told him”; makan-de, “we two came”; mawo-j-e,
“thou camest” (imperf.); mawoj-de, “they two came” (impertf.);
mawaw-be, “you (pl.) came’; ma-be, “you two will come” (fut.);
mam-be, “you (pl.) will come”; mokojja-le, “I use to work all the
time” (habit.); mokojja-j-e, “thou usest to work all the time”; etc.
And for secondary forms: howboka-le, “I killed (something)” (aor.) ;
howbok-e, “thou killedest (something)” ; howbok-e (3™ p.s. id.) ; honda-
bok-e, howbok-e, hojbok-e, etc. (1**, 2"", 3"" p. du. etc. id.) ; mokojbo-
ja-le, “I do, make (something) every time” (second. habit. or iterat.) ;
mokojbojow-be (2 p. du. id.) ; hodabon-de, “T shall kill (something)” ;
howbon-de (2™ p.s. id.); hobo-be (2™ p. du. id.); etc.
   In composed verbal forms the second constituent of the compound
carries the indicative sign, and this follows either the same rules as
for the present, the habitualis or the imperfect on the one hand, or
those for the secondary aorist or the secondary future on the other,
according to whether the compound is one of the II"" or one of the
I** category described in III. 4.9. For examples see ibid.
   The sign of the adhortative is zero; e.g., mada, “let me come”; maj,
“come thou!”; ma, “let us two come’; etc. For the adhortative in
secondary forms, see III. 4.4; and in composite forms ITI. 4. 9.
   The conditional 9 has only endings of its own in the singular, both
primary and secondary, and in the secondary dual and plural, the
primary forms of the dual and plural being supplied by the present
of the indicative. The sign is b in all forms, except the 1°* and 2™ p.s.","[28, 29]"

"      The objective affixes are:
(1) -ko-, which envisages the action as active transitive and directed
upon an object other than the subject. Often the object and/or the
action itself is plural, Hence it can also be used in reciprocal actions,
i.e., where both persons involved in the actions are at once subject
and object ;
 (2) -hi- [~ -si-] ~ -fi-, which indicates a bringing together, uniting,
collecting, connecting or fastening of the object or objects, but some-
times also a disuniting, disconnecting of what belongs together, while
often the original meaning is not clear any more;
(3) -ha- [~ -sa-] ~ -fa-, which indicates a putting into something of,
or filling something with, the object, but sometimes also the taking
out of something which belongs in something.
    Examples: molow-ko-ke, “he made, worked on (something), planted
(a garden)” ; kajew-ko-ke, “he split, cut (the sago)” ; awaj-ko-ke, “they
two struck (the paddles), they rowed”; anaw-ko-ke, “he ate (food)” ;
hubajej-ko-ke, “they two met each other”; (a) kilaj-ko-ke, “they two
had words (a) with each other”; alaw-ko-ke, “(after) he had spoken
(those words)” ; adilaw-fi-ke, “he collected” ; molow-fi-ke, “he fastened
(something)” ; honoj-na-hi, “lie on it!”; bukaw-fi-ke, “he left, took his
leave”; anaj-si, “drink thou!” (specialized meaning as opposed to
anaj-ko, “eat’); naj-sa-ke, “they stuck into”; ajew-fa-ke, “it jammed,
got stuck in, between” ; okow-fa-ke, “he poured into”; balaj-sa, “open,
unpack (something) to take out what is in it”; budelaj-sa, same
meaning ; etc.

"      The directive affixes are:

 (in space), or an action, lasting in its effect up to the present time ;
 (2) -a- for a movement away from the speaker (in space) or an action,
 lasting in effect away in time, i., without a definite or definitely
 known      end;
 (3)     -ho-   [c -so-] ~-fo-          for a movement       “across and away”,      going
 over, going off;

"V.6.1.    Coordination   of phrases.
   For the coordinative combination of phrases the regular procedure
is simple serial order without coordinator, e.g., amma dejmaj koma,
“let us eat (and) make merry”; awnuke neko le buko da awole, “he
rose (and) went to his father’s presence” ; Dajma kulum uke na ahamam
dowke fala jadowkoke waku ambaj dowke joku ambaj jawawnohoke,
“D. packed up, took his food, seized his bow-and-arrow, took a drum,
(and) a dog accompanied him”; Dajma ft nawkoke mala dowke meke
okowfake    ne-ka mije         olo,   “D.     picked         out the sago,      took   the pith,
descended, poured it in, (but) his elder brother’s wife was not there” ; etc.
     However,    contrastive      coordination          of    phrases   can,    if stressed,    be
expressed by bele-je, “but, however” (demonstrative bele, “that”, with
emphatic particle je); eg., hinawmihike bele-je do ambaj fam na da
’ajej, “he asked them (for it), but not even one man gave (it) to him” ;
ne-ko a moj-moj mokowowna                   bele-je aj da ’ajaj, “his father was. very
soft-spoken towards him, but he did not go inside’; da wej a ahi
‘alajkoj bele-je obo kalu fam da da 'ajej mo bele-je wa kalu daka make
wa obo hownoboke, “I have not disobeyed your words, but a young
pig even you did not give me, but hardly has your son here come (then)
you slaughtered a pig for him”’; etc.
   Coordinative serial construction without coordinator is usual even
where we would use clause or phrase subordination; eg., ne-waw
ukawna iso fonde, “his mother’s brother told him to cross ashore” (lit.
“told him (that) he will cross ashore”); do ahi ukawmi joku fokajde
molajkoke, “other men he-told-them they crossed (and) they buried
the dog”, i.e., “he gave them an order, so that they crossed...” ; mije
wena make daka ja nahi’bi hadake, “the woman (who) came yesterday,
suddenly died today”; wahena ja hewboke na ubaka ne-ka mije le fi
da awojde, “(when on) the morrow day had broken, his younger brother
and his elder brother’s wife went to the sago (bushes)”; u foj dowke

remained     sitting”;   hokolo   be kokokajde     na ubaka   Hebsjkoj     Dajma

adakawna, “(while, as) the two young (girls) did their work, her
the) younger sister H. saw D.”; ete.
   But often particles like mo, “just, only, but” ; and nahi’bi, “suddenly,
promptly”, occurring after the subordinate clause and before the head
respectively, may serve as pseudo coordinators, e.g., natumeke mo
Abalo     Jakali hubajejkoke, “he had just (i.e. after he had) put off,
(then)    Sbale Jakali (and he) met”; nakawkoke mo dala ikajnale, “he
had but just settled, sat down, (with them), (then) they gave him goods” ;
ne-ka mije make nahibi na molo Hijaka da huwownokoke, “(when)
his elder brother’s wife had come (home), she promptly informed her
husband H.”; ng-ka ikowna nahibi wawna, “(after) her elder sister
had given (it) to her, she suddenly said...” ; dowke mo nahi'bi ojboj-
owboke, “he had only just taken (it), (then) promptly it fell apart” ;
Dajma jo da make mo nahi’bi ng-ka mije na da ake, “D. had only just
come home, (then) promptly his elder brother’s wife went to him” ;
Dajma mawwawdike mo nahi’bi i fownanake, “D. had hardly arrived,
(then) he jabbed at him with fire” ; etc.

nation of phrases hereafter.","[64, 65]"
"   There are five tenses: the present, the habitualis, the imperfect, the
aorist and the future. Tense distinctions are restricted to the indicative;
they are unknown in the other moods.
   The sign of the present is zero, this tense being recognizable by the
“actual” subject person affixes only. The habitualis is characterized
by -ja-, added to the root extended with -j-, the imperfect by -wo-,
                                         MORPHOLOGY                                       23
and the aorist by -ka-. The future has gero, like the present, and is
distinguished from it by the “eventual” person subject affixes only,
except for the secondary future, which shows, in addition to this,
a constant n (in the 2” p. pl. m before b) preceding the indicative sign
in all persons other than the 2"" p. du. which has zero before b. Except
for this secondary future and the secondary aorist, the tense elements
precede the person affixes for the subject. Their vowel follows the
same morphophonemic rules as that of the root, when in contact with
the initial vowel of a following affix (see III. 4.1). The tense affixes
contract with the person affix and/or the modal sign in certain forms
of the aorist as described in III. 4.2. The affix -ja- of the habitualis
often assimilates to -jo- after a syllable containing 0. Examples: m-ale,
“T come” (pres.); ma-le, “he comes”; ma-k-ale, “IT came” (aorist) ;
ma-k-s, “thou camest” (aor.); ma-w-ale, “T came” (imperf.) ; ma-wo-le,
“he came” (imperf.); ma-da-le, “I shall come” (fut.); ma-le, “thou wilt
come”;       ma-n-de,        “he will come”;     ma-naj-de,        “they   two   will come” ;
mokoj-jo-le, mokoj-ja-le, “he works all the time” (habit.) ; mokoj-jo-je,
mokoj-ja-je,         “thou     art working     all the time’;         dawaj-ja-le,    “he is
opening all the time”; dawaj-bo-j-a-le, “I use to open every time”
(habit. second. form, or iterat., with asp. aff. -bo-); etc. For the
secondary aorist and future see further IIT. 4. 6.","[30, 31]"

"   Jakali of Sbalo and Hubulew.
   One day Hubulew (went) to Ohej village for the claiming of goods.
Just (as) he-had-put-off, he-met Jakali of Sbalo (Wit.: Jakali they-
two-met-each-other).23 Jakali of S balo asks-him: “Father, thou (goest)
whither?” Hubulew says-to-him: “Father, I (go) to Ohej village to
claim goods.” Jakali of Sbalo to Hubulew says                      [-to-him]:   “Father,
I-shall-await-thee in the Buki.” Hubulew went-up to Ohej village.
He-went-up (and) by Cape Wajona he landed. (After) he-had-stayed-
there a while, they-gave-him the goods, (and) finally he-put-off (and)
went-home. (Since) Jakali of Sbalo had not waited-for-him in the
Buki, he-put-out (and) went-up to the open water. (After) he-had-
gone-up, they-two-met-each-other in the open water. Jakali of A bala
asks [-him] [to] Hubulew: “Father, those goods did-they-give- (them-)
to-thee?” Hubulew says-to-him: “Yes, father, they-did-give- (it-) to-
me”. Jakali of Sbalo says-to-him: “Father, let-us-two-see (it) now.”
 Hubulew took (it, and) opened (it), (and) just as they-two-had-looked,
 Jakali of Sbalo says-to-him: “Father, let-us-two-throw- (it-) down,
 will-it-float,   the   thing?”      (i.e,   if we   throw   it in the water,   will   this
stuff remain afloat ?). Hubulew speaks: “Who knows?” Finally they-
two-threw, (and) promptly it-sank. Hubulew made a very big uproar
against Jakali of Sbalo. After that, though, they-two-went-back to
the Buki. (After) they-two-had-stayed in the Buki, they-two-went-off
to their own villages; Hubulew to Jawbe village, Jakali of Sbalo to
his own J bala village. Just as they-two-were-coming-back on the open
 lake, Jakali of Sbalo to Hubulew says [-to-him] : “Mine, father, mine

 (is) one garden (z.e., I have a certain garden), (which) is-all-the-time-
 lying without seedlings. Wilt-thou-cut (and) wilt-thou-come- (and-)
 give-me some more hakaj seedlings?” Hubulew says-to-him: “Father,
 don’t worry; my (own) hakaj seedlings (are) very extraordinary.”
 Hubulew went (and) cut (at) new 28 seedlings, came-back (with them,
 and) gave [-him] (them) to Jakali of        Hbalo. Jakali of Sbala planted
 (them) in his own garden, (but after) they-had-come-up, they-kept-on-
 standing (only) ; its fruits (were) just not (there).","[81, 82]"
