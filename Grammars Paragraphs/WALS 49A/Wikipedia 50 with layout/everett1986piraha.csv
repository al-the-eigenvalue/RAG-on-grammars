14.5 Tense and categorial restrictions on subordinate clauses.      See sect.
18 for a discussion of verbal morphology. There is no verbal category of tense
in Pirahä. Subordinate clause verbs tend to be less inflected than those in
matrix clauses (i.e., they are shorter). The function of this restriction is
apparently to limit the appearance of overly complex syntactic configurations.
But this is not followed rigidly—factors of style, context, etc. play an
important role in these variations. A full discussion of such restrictions is
beyond the scope of the present study.
14.6 Grammatical relations in subordinate clauses.          Word order, as in
matrix clauses, is the principal indicator of grammatical relations in subordinate
clauses. Although subordinate clauses (cf. sects. 2 and 13) manifest elliptical
anaphora to antecedents in the main clause, when nominal constituents are
overtly expressed, their order is S - Oblique     - Direct      - V. No affix has
been observed to have the function of marking participants or grammatical
relations in the subordinate clause.

15.1 Marking for case.        As is discussed in sect. 1 and elsewhere, the
principal marker of grammatical relations is word order. However, there are
morphological markers of oblique relations. For example, instrumental case is
expressed by -oal-ai 'INST' and locative or general oblique case is marked by
-o 'LOC/OBL'. This element may also be attached to postpositions and
particles (e.g., piaii 'also'—see sect. 8.1) when these occur in the oblique
object position. In more theoretical terms, we might consider this position as
one receiving some sort of inherent case as a result of verbal subcategorization,
regardless of morphological category. Examples of this are:
(264a)    ti xahoigi- o      kahä- p-       i
          l   evening-OBL leave-IMPERF-PROX
          'I'm going in the evening.' (noun and oblique)
(264b)    ti     pi- o     baosai      xog- i- koi
          1      also-OBL cloth        want-EP-EMPH
               also want cloth.' (particle and oblique)
(264c)    gi ti xigi-     o      kaha-p-         i
          2 1 ASSOC-OBL go- IMPERF-PROX
         'You will go with me.' (postposition and oblique)  More discussion of this case marking is given below in the appropriate
sections.","[71, 72]"
"
   In this case, kohoibiihai receives its subject function of the matrix clause
from the first hi and gaihi 'that' receives its object function from the pronoun
hi immediately preceding the verb root xogi 'want'. The second hi is the
subordinate clause subject. For further discussion, cf. Everett (1983; 1984a). In
other words, nominal elements are understood as bearing certain thematic
relations to the clause (agent, patient, etc.) due to their coreference with
pronominal elements which occur in these basic (subcategorized) positions.",[60]
"
   I have not observed any examples of verbs without an oblique or direct
object nominalized by ~sai.
   Another function of -sai is possibly to mark subordinate clauses of condition:
compare the discussion in sect. 14.2.3.
   -sai is frequently found in quotative clauses (cf. sect. 14.3). In these clauses
its function is also that of nominalizer—to transform the verb gai 'speak/say'
into a nominal. This is interesting for its frequency. With rare exceptions gai
only occurs in nominalized form. The most common non-nominalized verb
form for quotatives is xaho 'speak/say'. Perhaps gai-sai 'saying/speech' is a
crystallized form owing to some feature of its diachronic development (gai, as
has been noticed by Aryon Rodrigues (p.c.), is similar to the verb 'to say' in
Tupi languages, which could indicate borrowing as a possible explanation for
its restricted usage).
   There is no gerundive use of -sai. Therefore, the examples below, (290) and
(291), are not grammatical with the (i) interpretations. Only the (ii)
interpretations are acceptable.(290)    hi ti xap-i- sai           xog- i- hiab- a

distinctions are lost in nominalized forms. The basic form of nominalizations
is:
         V.ROOT + (EP i) + -saiFor a more detailed discussion on aspectual distinctions and positional classes
of verbal affixes, see sect. 18.
  In quotatives, the subject of the matrix clause becomes the possessor of the
nominalized form of gai 'say'. In other nominalized expressions, the subject
may appear optionally as possessor.
  The nominalizer -sai is frequently used to produce a pseudo-infinitive type
construction:
(292)     kohoibiihai   xibiib-i-  hai                     gixai
          Kohoibiihai   order-PROX-RELATIVE CERT           2
          xahoi-kasi bag-i- sai
          rice- name sell-EP-NOMLZR
          'Kohoibiihai orders/wants you to sell (some) rice.'
15.4.3 Conclusion.      As is seen in the discussion above, we are only just
beginning to understand the various functions of nominalization in Pirahä.
Certain elements are still problematic.
  One of these elements is the suffix -si. In certain constructions, -si seems to
function as a nominalizer.
(293)     ko kab- i- si
          eye NEG-EP-NOMLZR
          'the blind man/the one without eyes'  In other examples, -si seems to serve merely as an optional marker of
proper nouns or nouns resulting from morphemic combinations:
(294a)     xisaabi (-si) ti xahaigi
           Xisaabi (-?)    1 brother
           'Xisaabi, my brother'
(294b)     xahoa    + ogii     —»     xahoaogii(si)       '(the) big night'
           night      big   (Cf. sect. 22 for a discussion of morphophonemic processes.)
  A possible explanation of the function of -si in examples such as (294) is
that it marks some sort of change in the function of a particular expression.
All names for people are derived from verbal constructions, animal names,
nominal phrases, etc. In about 90% of these cases, -si occurs optionally in                                                                Brought to you by | Cambridge University Library

280                                Daniel Everettmorpheme final position, as though marking a change in the basic reference or
function. A problem with this analysis is that -si (or a homonymous
 morpheme) also occurs in other environments. Thus, no firm conclusions on
 the function of this element can be stated at present.
    However, recent work by Paul Hopper and Sandra Thompson (Paul Hopper
 (p.c.)) on the notion of ""categoriality"" offers some possible insights into this
 nominalizer. According to their work, categories such as noun or verb are
 functionally explained in terms of their discourse function. Thus, events are
 less ""verby"" when their function is less related to foregrounded information.
Thus, certain verbs will appear in nonfinite forms (participles, gerunds, etc.),
 while others occur in finite forms (more ""verby""), depending on their relative
 importance to the central event line. By this reasoning, we might expect
 certain nouns to appear more or less ""nouny"", depending upon their discourse
 function. An initial, as yet unchecked, intuition would seem to suggest that
 this might explain the function of the nominalizer -si. That is, it may occur
 with certain nouns, more central to the conversation and/or the major
 participants in discourse, as a way of making them still more ""nouny."" This
 hypothesis is by no means firm but I believe it holds promise for future
 research.
16 Pronoun system16.1 General remarks.     The pronominal system is relatively simple. For
example, there are no special forms for reciprocals, reflexives, or possessives.
As is seen below, there are a few differences between free vs. bound forms.
Nimuendaju (1948) went so far as to suggest that the entire system might have
been borrowed from the lingua franca of the area, Nheengatu, a Creole
language based on Tupinambä (still spoken near Manaus, according to Helen
Weir (p.c.)) See Everett (1984a) for further discussion of these and related
phenomena within a more theoretical framework.
16.2 Personal pronouns16.2.1 Basic distinctions.   The free forms of personal pronouns are:
(295)   ti                    'first person'        ('!')
(296)   gixai                 'second person1       ('2')
(297)   hiapioxio             'third person'        ('3')  There are no special plural forms for these pronouns, hiapioxio '3' may be
plural or singular. Generally, first person plural and second person plural are
expressed paraphrastically (cf. sect. 16.2.2).","[79, 80, 81]"
"  On the other hand, there are constructions similar to (182) which request
permission. In these cases gixai '2' is substituted by // T and the subsequent
change in translation would be 'Hey Xoogiai, may I put some earth here?'
  There are forms for requests in negative form (cf. sect. 11.2.2).
11.2.1.2 Commands. Commands are divided according to illocutionary force
into those in which an imperative pronoun occurs and those in which it does
not.
   Almost all commands have the suffix -ati 'UNCERT'. This is similar to
imperative mood in the sense usually used in describing ancient Greek for
example, where this mood "" . . . expresses neither probability nor possibility,
but only intention, and is, therefore, the furthest removed from reality."" (Dana
and Mantey, 1927:174).
   It is in this sense of removal from reality that the term 'UNCERT' is used
to translate -ati. On the other hand, -ati is not exclusively imperative in nature
and thus the gloss 'IMP' would be incorrect. Compare sect. 18 for a fuller
discussion (note that -ati is not the only suffix used with imperatives). It is
thus perhaps a type of ""irrealis"" suffix.",[48]
"13.2.5 Restrictions on anaphora. To sum up the observations made in this
section, we note again that anaphora is restricted syntactically and
pragmatically. Syntactically: (i) it generally operates intrasententially, connecting
matrix subject with coreferent subordinate clause subject or connecting nouns in
or outside of verbal argument positions (such as topics, clarification, etc.) with
pronouns in order to attribute their thematic relations to the clause; (ii) it is
subject to severe restrictions on the linear relationships between antecedents and

                                                                                               Authenticated
                                                                            Download Date | 3/28/17 5:53 PM
262                               Daniel Everett
pronouns. Pragmatically: (i) intersentential anaphoric reference may occur when
the context is sufficiently clear to disambiguate reference or (ii) the
intersentential marking of participants is realized by the repetition of the
proper nouns in each independent sentence in which reference is desired. In (i)
when reference is particularly clear, anaphoric relations may be established
through zero anaphora. (Cf. sect. 1.5, (35) and (36).)14 Subordinate clauses14.1 General remarks.         Certain types of subordinate clause (nominalized,
temporal and conditional) are marked morphologically on the subordinate verb
(see sect. 14.2.1-3 below and sect. 18). Others (see sect. 14.2.4-8) are
paratactically connected to the matrix clause (that is, they are phonologically
rather than morphologically marked). There are examples of verb incorporation
(sect. 18.7) which might possibly be interpreted as ""clause union"" or
""predicate raising"" except that (i) (pro)nominals may not occur in these cases,
(ii) the units so formed are syntactically indivisible (that is, their components
are morphological, functioning together as a single syntactic constituent), and
(iii) finally, we note that (a) only verb roots may be incorporated, affixed
elements may not be incorporated and (b) verb roots often are homonymous
with semantically related verb suffixes. By (i)-(iii) we conclude that such
examples are to be analyzed as complex verbs in which each verb root is
understood to have the same subject (hence this is called ""verbal
incorporation"" in section 18). This is different from the classic cases of clause
union in which both verbs may be understood to take different subjects.
Another characteristic of clause union which these examples lack, related to the
first, is what Harbert (1977:123) calls ""underlying bisententiality."" (Cf. sect.
18 for further discussion.)
   The ordering of basic constituents is the same for subordinate clauses as for
matrix clauses, although subordinate clauses do not have peripheral constituents
(cf. sect. 1.5 above) but only verbal arguments.
   There is no preclausal complementizer such as English 'that' in Pirahä.
Rather, complements are introduced morphologically by verbal forms (cf. the
discussion below).
   Relative clauses are dealt with in sect. 15.3.2.","[62, 63]"
"9.2.2 How and when expressed.        Clarification is frequently used with
(potentially) reflexive sentences. In these cases, reference is extremely
ambiguous as to the nature of the action and participants involved without
some type of clarifying information.(116)   hi   hi xib-ao-   b-   i-  xi                             kapoiti
        3    3 hit-TELIC-PERF-PROX-COMPLETE CERT                  Kapoiti
        xabiai
        Xabiai
        (i) 'Kapoiti hit Xabiai' or
        (ii) 'Kapoiti and Xabiai hit themselves.'   (i) would be the normal interpretation of (116) and (ii) a very rare, but
grammatical, possibility. The order of noun phrases in clarification is always
subject-direct object (I have not observed any larger expansions with oblique
objects). Therefore, in (116) the nonreflexive interpretation is kapoiti as agent
and xabiai as patient. It seems that the order is not so important in the
reflexive (ii) interpretation, although this requires further study. Example (116)
represents clarification since it functions as a type of afterthought on the
identity of the participants rather than as the ""theme"" of the discussion.",[31]
"   It should be noted, however, that response forms vary considerably, from
complete sentences (infrequent) to those listed above (common). The reaction
most common to questions, however, is nothing—silence or complete lack of
acknowledgement.
  There are no special intonational features for responses, the pattern being
that found in declaratives.
11 Imperatives
11.1 General remarks.         Imperatives may be marked by an imperative
pronoun (in case of strongest illocutionary force). The imperative pronouns are
goi '2' and kaxao T (the hortatory mood). In my data kaxao and xogiagao
'everyone' seem to be the only inherently plural items in the lexicon.
   Imperative constructions, as is seen below, are calibrated in terms of
illocutionary force, the strongest form using one of the imperative pronouns
plus the verbal suffix -ati 'UNCERT'. The weakest imperative form is the
indirect request (sect. 11.2.1.1).
11.2 Marking of imperatives
11.2.1 Positive forms
11.2.1.1 Requests.    Just as it is possible to say in English, ""My, that sure
smells like good pie,"" and mean ""May I have a piece of pie?"", so in Pirahä
assertions may function as indirect requests for information or action on the
part of the hearer.
  Thus, someone might say to another who is eating:
(178)    xmh     ti xi        xaaga-hoag- a
         EXCLM 1 hunger have- INGR-REMOTE
         'Hmm, I just became hungry!'",[47]

                                                                                               Authenticated

  (319) presupposes that someone bought something but that that someone is
known by the hearer and not by the speaker ('No one else . . . it was John,
me, etc.').
16.3.3 Nonspecific indefinite.   The only candidate for expressing this notion
is again hi(apioxio). In examples such as (312) and (313) above, hi(apioxio)
may be interpreted as a dummy/pleonastic element such as English One' or
French 'il'. However, I have no clearer examples in my data and thus merely
mention the possibility.
16.4 Possessive pronouns.        There are no special possessive forms. The
personal pronouns discussed earlier also function as possessives. Free forms are
used in the sense of 'mine', 'yours', 'his', etc., while bound forms are used
adjectivally, as is also seen in sect. 15.2.
(320)     ti hoaoii    gäihi
          1 shotgun that
          (i)    'That('s) my shotgun' or
          (ii)   That shotgun is mine.'
(32 la)   kaoi tiihi
          who Brazil nut
          'Whose Brazil nut (is this)?'
(32 Ib)   gixai
          2
          'Yours.'
16.5 Demonstrative pronouns.          There are two demonstrative pronouns in
Piraha, gaihi 'that' and giisai 'this'. Both have been mentioned several times
in this paper. As is seen by their translations, they are distinguished by the
proximity of the referent to the speaker (and thus may also be labelled as
'distal' and 'proximal' deictics, respectively).
  These demonstratives are used both independently and adjectivally. Their
independent use is generally observed in response forms.
(322a)    hi go igi- og- i          nix
          3 WH take-want-PROX INTER
          'What do you want to take?'

"   In (217), and other examples of this type, reference between pronominals
and antecedents is established by a rule which ""binds"" the leftmost pronoun to
the leftmost proper noun. The order of the pronouns, left-right before the verb,

corresponds to the grammatical relations subject-direct object. As is seen in
sect. 1, this is also the unmarked order of transitive clause constituents in
general. It is evident, however, that a full explanation of such anaphoric
relations requires a much more detailed analysis of how linearity is ""able"" to
establish these relations. In Everett (1983; 1984a), we attempt to show that the
notions of ""government,"" ""Case,"" and ""reference chain"" of Chomsky (1982)
offer an explanation for these phenomena in general.(218)    ti      xi             xoba-i- hiab-a              baosai gaihi

"  In this case, although the form controlling the ""reflexive"" is in the same
subordinate clause, it is coreferent with the subject of the matrix clause.
Although I have no examples of direct interclausal control I would expect to
come across some, subject to the condition stated above.
4.1.4 Syntactic function of the reflexive.          This discussion has been
admittedly superficial, since reflexivity, although an expressible notion in
Pirah , does not have any morphological or special syntactic functions. It is
not treated differently from other subject-object relations in the language. For
this reason, perhaps it would be best to view reflexivity as a purely semantic
notion in Pirah (cf. Everett (1983) for a more detailed discussion).
4.2 Reciprocals.    The notion of reciprocity enjoys about the same status in
Pirah as reflexivity. However, there is a morpheme which can enter into a
sort of pseudoreciprocal. This is the collective pronoun xogiagao 'everyone'.
Thus there are sentences such as:
(78)    xogiagao hi xobai-xiig-
        everyone 3 see- CONT-REMOTE
        (i)   'Everyone sees each other' or
        (ii) 'Everyone sees themselves' or
        (iii) 'Everyone sees him' or
        (iv) 'Everyone sees.'",[19]
"16.2.3 Pragmatic aspects of hi(apioxio).         hi frequently functions as a
pleonastic element or impersonal indefinite (and it is, in these cases, the
neutral form, in the sense that it is used when no definite reference is
required). Since (proper) nouns are commonly used to make definite references,
pronouns with this function are a kind of ""marked"" case in the sense of ""not
usual."" hi, on the other hand, may be used for nondefinite reference as well
and in this usage is not '""marked"" but in fact quite common. Moreover, hi
may even be used to refer to first or second persons as well as third person.
This often occurs in indirect speech to decrease illocutionary force. The
resultant referential ambiguity is resolved through the context.(312)    hi xob-aaxai ti
         3 see- well 1
         'Someone knows a lot, (and that someone is) me.'(313)    hi go ga- xai

         'What (was it that) r he                  said?'

                               \ y°        /
  hi is the most common pronominal form in WH-type interrogatives.
  Further, contrary to the analysis of SS, hi often refers to female participants
(cf. sect. 16.2.4).
16.2.4 Pronominal distinctions based on class or gender. Previous studies
distinguished between several different pronominal types according to class or
gender (cf. the remarks of sect. 16.2.1). However, as is shown in sect. 22,
these ""pronouns"" are, in my analysis, the results of an optional phonological
rule of prefixation. Nevertheless, there appears to be a difference based on
gender which, although not consistently maintained, warrants mention.

284                               Daniel Everett  I have, again, recorded several examples in which hi clearly refers to
women. However, I have not recorded any examples in which jci refers to
men. Thus there is evidence for a (rather weak) gender distinction (cf. also
sect. 22.3.1.3).
16.3 Indefinite pronouns
16.3.1 Specific indefinite.   This notion is expressed frequently by the free
form hiapioxio '3'.

         'Is that foreigner sick?'
(318b)   kaba hiapioxio
         NEC 3
         'No, someone else is sick.'
16.3.2 Negative indefinite.   The negative indefinite is expressed (exclusively
in responses in my data) by the negation of hiapioxio '3'.
(319a)   hiapioxio xo- ao-    b-      όχόί

         'Did someone else buy that?'
(319b)   hiapioxio hiab- iig- a
         3         NEG-CONT-REMOTE
         'No one else.'","[84, 85]"
"   Note the double occurrence of -o in (331). This differs from (329) and (330)
since the noun within the postpositional phrase also manifests the locative
suffix. Although this type of double occurrence is common, I am not sure of
the conditions under which it may appear. Structurally, we might consider this
to be along the lines of [x1 [x ][x ]] in which oblique case is assigned to x1
and manifested on all constituents of the same category dominated by x1.
  As is seen in (329) and (330), postpositions are generally derived from the
names of body parts. Postpositional phrases may also be negated:(332)    xoogiai hi kaii- o- xio          hiab- iig- a
         Xoogiai 3 house-LOC-DIR          NEG-CONT-REMOTE
         'Xoogiai is not going home.'",[88]
"   I am skeptical of this analysis, although I have no strong counter evidence.
The form might be a shortened form of xisi 'animal' in which case (65) would
be     hit an animal', a very common phrase meaning         arrowed an animal.'
The informant could conceivably have given this phrase rather than what the
linguist had attempted to elicit since this might seem like a more ""useful""
phrase to teach someone.
   On the other hand, si might have simply lost its distinctiveness as other
pronouns were generalized to function also as reflexives. For a hypothesis as to
the diachronic development of these pronouns, see sect. 16 and Everett (1983).
   Other examples of reflexives, given in a paradigmatic form are:
(67)   ti      gi xib-äo-  b-   ä-     ha
         1     2 hit-TELIC-PERF-REMOTE-COMPLETE CERT

288                                  Daniel Everett   I have not observed any examples of ""preposition stranding"" in my data
(cf. ""Apples, I want a lot of""). Further, in my data, postpositions occur
exclusively with nouns.
18 Verb structure
18.0 Introduction.       As in the majority of Amazonian languages, the area
most resistant to analysis in Pirahä grammar has proven to be the verbal
morphology. Although knowledge of this area is growing rapidly through
analysis and language learning, I am still some way from a complete analysis.
   Besides various morphophonological complications (cf. sects. 22 and 23)
there is a certain reluctance to repeat utterances verbatim. Informants prefer to
paraphrase rather than repeat. The fact also that the people are monolingual
complicates the task considerably.
   Although SS (1976) lists ten positional classes for verbal suffixes, with
approximately three members of each class, I believe the number of classes to
be more like fifteen, with several possible tonal suprafixes yet to be analyzed.
With the exception of imperative pronouns (cf. sects. 9, 11 and 16), the
categories below are expressed exclusively by affixes. This study has benefitted
significantly from the pioneering work of SS (1976) and KE (1981), although I
have reservations with regard to certain sections of their analyses.
   In any case, the responsibility for this section is mine. Exemplification of
the various suffixes in this section is minimal since they have been illustrated
many times throughout this study.
   Not all of the suffixes discussed below may occur simultaneously. This is
because the suffixes are arranged syntagmatically in various positional classes
which follow the verb root. Members of the same class cannot cooccur and
between classes semantic and pragmatic restrictions limit cooccurrence. The
reader is referred to the Table for a general view. In Everett (1983) initial
suggestions are offered for a treatment of morphological cooccurrence
restrictions along the lines of Muysken (1981).","[88, 89]"
"  In this case the verbal element expresses more the idea of identity, focussing
on the thing possessed rather than the possessor.
1.4 Equative clauses. Equatives are used in the general sense of description
(which includes possession, identity, etc.). Elements which occur as
complements in equatives are modifiers, nouns, and other equative clauses (cf.
(25) and (26)). The only distinction between these and copulars is the absence
of a verbal element. For example, in (25) the verb construction xao-xaaga 'to
have' could appear in final position with no apparent change in use or
translation.

(25)    xaooi      hi xapisi bigai
        foreigner 3 arm         thick
        'The foreigner has a thick arm (i.e., is strong).'
(26)    giopaixi hi sabi-xi

(27)    kohoibiihai hi kaiii      gaihi
        Kohoibiihai 3 house that
        That is Kohoibiihai's house.'
1.5 Peripheral constituents. Simple sentences generally comprise only those
constituents which are basic or characteristic, in the sense of the discussion
above. The minimal number of constituents in declarative sentences is one, the                                                             Brought to you by | Cambridge University Library

206                                 Daniel Everettpredicate (supposing that the sentence in question is not a realization of certain
phenomena related to the larger context, such as question-response sequences,
etc. In these cases, as in English and other languages, syntactic irregularities
are permitted which would be ungrammatical in other situations).
   Other constituents are possible, however, under the general label of oblique
object (temporal expressions, conditionals, indirect objects, certain particles (cf.
sect. 21), etc.) At present, the evidence (basically morphological, cf. below)
seems to indicate that no rigid distinctions between these elements should be
postulated. Note in sect. 15 that oblique case is generally shown by the suffix
-o. For this reason as well, I have not proposed distinct categories for
di-intransitive or di-transitive clauses.
   Verbs such as xaha 'to go' and xoba. 'to throw' do not treat indirect objects
differently from other oblique objects but treat all elements in oblique position
in the same manner. Therefore, I have considered this entire class of elements
as peripheral to transitive and intransitive clause types.
   Oblique objects are inserted in the position immediately to the right of the
subject. When these objects are larger than five or six syllables they tend to
undergo movement to postverbal position. This is apparently a stylistic
mechanism to avoid overcrowding of the space between S and V, reminiscent
of ""Heavy Shift"" (cf. (34) below).(28)    xoogiai hi hi-ό        xiii      xoab- ao-  ρ- ί

sect. 9 below, repetition is frequently used to more clearly specify a particular
situation. Here the speaker specifies by two locative expressions that he wants
someone to put the pencil on top of the table which requires an action
downward.

"   Certain semantic differences have been noted among the modifiers of
quantity present in (272) - (276): baagiso 'many' (272) vs. xaibai 'many'
(274); xapagi 'much' (273) vs. xogii 'big/much' (275).
   For example, (273) and (274) illustrate mass nouns vs. count nouns. When
the head is a mass noun the modifier used is-xapagi. In other cases it would
be xaibai.
   The differences between baagiso vs. xaibai on the one hand and xapagi vs.
xogii on the other are more subtle. An initial hypothesis is that baagiso differs
from xaibai in that the former is mostly used with less tangible elements such
as hoa 'day'. In my (limited) intuition hoa xaibai would be less acceptable
than hoa baagiso. (*hoa xapagi would be completely unacceptable.)
   xogii 'big' is less commonly translated 'much'. I believe, however, that
xogii and xapagi are interchangeable although xapagi is more common.
   The morpheme xoihi 'small' of (276) is translatable either as 'small' or
'few/small quantity of (as xogii is either 'large' or 'much/large quantity of).
Due to these observations, no distinction has been made in this analysis
between modifiers of ""quantity"" and modifiers of ""quality.""

"
   Note that new information, in this case the word xahoigio 'in the afternoon',
is generally introduced by a quotative construction. In the majority of texts I
have observed, quotatives are used to mark significant changes of participants,
time, or event. Reference (intersentential) is kept clear through knowledge of
context. Indirect speech and direct speech are distinguished through intended
reference of pronominals in subordinate, quotative clauses. See sect. 14 below.",[33]
"15.3 Modifiers15.3.1 Adjectives.     The category ""adjective"" does not appear to be a
distinct morphological class in Pirahä, since noun modifiers may, for the most
part, also modify verbs.
   Modified nominal phrases are distinguished from purely possessive phrases in
that modifiers follow, while possessors normally precede, the phrase head. The
normal noun phrase has at most two modifiers. The largest noun phrase in my

22.3.3.3 Syllable modifications in morphemic combinations.        The remarks
in this section are further exemplified and argued for in D. Everett (1981) and
SS (1974). I will merely describe the grosser aspects of the phonological
consequences of morphemic combinations in this section.
   In D. Everett (1981), it is suggested that syllable structure and stress
placement operate syntagmatically without respect for morpheme boundaries,
while tone is assigned paradigmatically, i.e., as a melody (or feature) of the
word or morpheme. Its assignment to individual vowels is affected by changes
in syllable structure and stress placement. The following observations would
appear to support the first claim.
   These observations are limited, however, to noun 4- adjective or noun +
verb sequences. For other sequences, see earlier sections (cf., for example,
sects. 18 and 19).
   In sequences such as (471)-(475), the (a) examples show original syllable,
stress, and tone configurations, and the (b) examples illustrate the modified
forms. (Suffix divisions have been omitted to eliminate confusion with syllable
structure—see sect. 18.)

         CW.CV.W.GV  The significant observation to be made with regard to the above examples is
that high tone in word final accented syllables is moved in morphemic
combinations. Moreover, this high tone actually appears to ""follow"" the accent
(cf. below) (although, naturally, to support this hypothesis it would be
necessary to (i) record many more such examples; and (ii) show through more
detailed argumentation the relevance of this observation — is it relevant?; does it
help capture significant generalizations?).
   When followed by a ""perturbable"" morpheme whose initial syllable is
accented after restructuring, high tone is dislocated to the right (471) and
(472). When the final syllable of the first morpheme is accented both prior to
and after restructuring, any high tone originating there will continue in that
syllable, regardless of its segmental composition (474). When, as in (475),
word final accent moves leftward, any high tone originating in that syllable
will also undergo left-dislocation, replacing the tone of the adjacent vowel.
   (476) below represents the class of words mentioned by SS (1974), namely,
words which end in
   In this class, the high or low tone on the penultimate vowel (a or o) extends
rightward in the same syllable. To use a more theoretical terminology, the tone
of the ""strong"" vowel replaces that of the ""weak"" vowel within the ""rhyme""
(cf. McCarthy (1979) and D. Everett (1981)).

                                 23 MORPHOLOGY
  The basic elements of inflectional morphology are found in sects. 15 and
18.
23.1 Compound words.         The criterion used to classify the examples to
follow as compound words rather than merely phrasal constructions is semantic.
For example, in (477) below, the syntagmeme xabagi soixaoxoisai may be
understood as 'toucan beak' or 'saw1, according to the context.
   However, the majority of speakers who, for example, ask me for a saw (or
other instrument with a compound name) find it very amusing and surprising
when I make some sort of remark relating 'saws' and 'toucan beaks'. In my
opinion, they are not even aware of the relationship unless they stop to reflect
for a moment.
   Of course, this criterion is not a strong one. Therefore, the conclusions
presented here are to be taken as tentative; i.e., it may be that some of these
examples are simply phrases.
23.1.1 Nouns
23.1.1.1 Noun + noun:
(477)   xabagi       +    soixaoxoisai —> xabagisoixaoxoisai   'saw'
        toucan            beak
(478)   xapai        + toii —> xapaitoii 'ladder'
        foot           handle
(479)   hoii     +       hoi —> hoiihoi   'bowstring'
        bow              vine
(480)   xapai        +    soi —> xapaisoi 'shoe'
        foot              learner
23.1.1.2 Noun + verb. Compare sect. 15.4, where examples of new words
formed by subject/agent nominalizations are given.
23.1.1.3 Noun + adjective:
(481)   pi    + gaia -*· pigaia 'scissors'
        thorn   crooked
(482)   kao + ogiai —>· kaogiai [type of bass (fish)]
        mouth big
23.1.2 Verbs.        Compare sect. 18.8 for a discussion of verb root
incorporation. It is difficult to determine whether this process is synchronically
productive. In other words, rather than being based exclusively on simple

                                                                             Download Date | 3/28/17 5:53 PM

the resultant forms often seem somewhat arbitrary in meaning and thus seem to
be diachronically formed rather than resulting from synchronic rules.
23.2 Basic word classes.       In sects. 19 and 20, we attempt to justify a
collapsing of adjectives and adverbs into one class of modifiers.
  To sum up, from sects. 15-21, we conclude that the basic,
morphosyntactically justifiable word classes in Pirahä are: nouns, pronouns,
postpositions, particles, modifiers, and verbs.
                             24 IDEOPHONES
  I have not observed any onomatopoeic forms or other types of noninflected
words similar to ideophones.","[120, 121, 122, 123, 124]"
"   In concluding this section on phrasal parataxis, we might note that, in
relation to coordination, the most common form of syntagmatic relating of
independent phrases is parataxis, in spite of the existence of piaii, the
conjunctive particle (cf. sect. 8).
2.2 Clauses
2.2.1 Matrix clauses.       The juxtaposition of matrix clauses is seen more
clearly in nonelliptical examples. It would be difficult to distinguish between
elliptical parataxis of clauses and the juxtaposition of verb phrases in an SOV
language (if such a distinction is even valid in the first place). Although
criteria might be found in the future to distinguish such cases in a
nonambiguous fashion, at present I am considering only those examples in
which the subject is repeated together with the verbal element, or the case of
imperatives and certain other clausal forms which do not necessarily contain an
overt subject.

"   As to the third type of deletion, as is seen in sect. 11.2.1.2, repetition is
frequently used in imperative constructions to increase the illocutionary force.
In these cases, the imperative pronoun goi is omitted in the repeated or

"   Apparently, the form of the negative in (205) -iab is due to the deletion of
initial h following a consonant. In other cases an epenthetic i is used to break
up the consonantal sequence. The factors determining the choice between
deletion or epenthesis are not yet clear to me.",[53]
"22.3.3 MorphophonologicaJ processes22.3.3.1 Prefixation.    What I am here calling ""prefixation"" is an optional
but highly frequent rule which changes the phonological forms of morphemes
in noun-adjective, noun-verb sequences. Much of what is discussed here has
also been discussed, with somewhat different conclusions, in Sheldon (1974).
This ""prefixation"" includes deletion and metathesis. There are, however, a
large number of morphophonological processes, especially those involving tone,
which are not fully understood and thus will not be discussed here.",[118]
"14.3.2 Indirect statements. As is seen in sect. 9, the principal distinction
between indirect and direct speech is seen in the reference of the complement
pronouns. Thus, in an example such as:(256)   hi   gai- sai        xahoapati        ti   xi       aagä-
        3    say-NOMLZR      Xahoäpäti         l   hunger   have-
        hoag- a
        INGR-REMOTE
        (i)    'Xahoäpäti said, ""I am hungry"" ' or
        (ii)   'Xahoäpäti said (that) I am hungry.'the correct translation of (256) depends on the reference attributed to the
pronoun ti T of the complement. If ti refers to xahoapaiti, then the correct
translation is the direct speech example, (i). If, on the other hand, ti is
construed as referring to the narrator, then (ii) is the correct translation. The
reference is pragmatically determined in such cases. Another interesting way of
distinguishing direct speech is in quotatives in which the person being quoted
is not a Pirahä but a native speaker of Portuguese. In such cases, the
complement tends to be in Portuguese with the matrix clause in Pirahä:
(257)   xaooi       hi gai- sai          ambora                      kob-
        foreigner   3 say-NOMLZR         away (Pg. 'embora')         see-

        ATELIC-RELATIVE CERT road (Pg. 'estrada')
        The Brazilian said, ""Let's go see the road"".'",[70]
"  In any case reflexivity is rarely expressed. This may be due to the ambiguity
inherent in the pronominal system, among other factors.
4.1.3 Scope of reflexivity. Reflexivity may be perceived as operating across
clause boundaries only as the direct object of the embedded clause is
understood through the context as coreferent with the subject of the matrix
clause.",[18]

15.2 Genitives.    The basic order of constituents in possessive phrases is:
        (N) +(PRO) +HEAD (at least one of the elements in parentheses
        must occur).
(265)   paita hi xitohoi
        Paita 3 testicles (prepuberty)
        'Paita's testicles'
(266)    ti kaiii
         1 house
         'my house'   I have no examples of expanded nominal expressions in pre-head position in
a possessive phrase. In fact, the expansion of a possessive phrase would follow
the order of any other noun phrase with the exception of the possessive
markers which precede rather than follow. Further, no distinctions have been
noticed for alienable vs. inalienable possession. Occasionally, the
nonpronominal element occurs in post-head position. This appears to be a type
of afterthought or clarification.
(267)    (hi) giopai xaxai
         (3) dog       Xaxäi
         'Xaxai's dog'  The only possible morphological marking of possession would be the
pre-head pronominal element. However, due to the fact that these elements also
occur as free forms, I have not labeled them as prefixes. However, see Everett
(1984a) for arguments that these may function as clitics in a more abstract
syntactic sense.
  There is evidence that the morphological markings of nouns was a
productive process in the past. SS (1969) notes that nouns normally end in -i
and that cylindrical objects begin with poo-.
  See sect. 1 for a discussion of possession in equative and copular clauses.","[72, 73]"

   Without the modifier xaibai 'many' either (i) or (ii) is a possible translation
for (277). With xaibai only (ii) is possible.
15.3.2 Relative clauses
15.3.2.1 Introduction.          Strategies of relativization include both
""non-reduction"" and ""gapping,"" either of which may also have the WH
element go 'what'.
  Comrie (1981:140) defines non-reduction relatives by saying that ""the
non-reduction type simply means that the head noun appears in full, unreduced
form in the embedded sentence in the normal position . . . .""
""Gap-relatives"" are described (1981:144) as not providing ""any overt
indication of the role of the head within the relative clause.""
  A few implications of the use of these relatives, their structure, and their
typological and theoretical significance are discussed below. First, however, let
us consider the following examples.
15.3.2.2 Gap-relatives:

   kaxao, as noted above, is frequently used in a joking fashion, in the sense
of 'Come on.' For example, when someone is leaving to perform a rather
disagreeable or difficult task (which only he can do in most cases), such as get
firewood for his family, receive an injection, etc., he might say to someone in
passing, kaxao 'Come on.' The normal response is a chuckle or a curse word.
11.2.2 Negative imperative (prohibitive).   As is seen in sect. 12, the verbal
suffix -sahai expresses the negative imperative. It is used rather than -hiab
'NONFMP.NEG' when a command is being given.

11.3 Responses to imperatives.      The most common response to imperatives
is nonverbal. That is, the hearer simply obeys or disobeys the command. If a
verbal response is given, it is generally something like, xigiai OK' or tisoxoa
   already (am doing it).'
   Refusals are almost always expressed by silence (or a laugh), although it is
possible to respond by saying something like xigiaihiaba 'Not OK', hiaba
'No', or something similar. There is no prescribed form, however, and
responses vary.
12 Negation
12.1 Sentence negation
12.1.1 Negative imperative (prohibitive).     As is mentioned in section
11.2.2, there is a verbal suffix, -sahai expressing the notion of prohibition.
The ""long form"" of this suffix is -sahaxai, the ""short form"" -sai. At the
moment, there is no strong evidence confirming or disconfirming SS's
hypothesis that,
        having chosen negative optative -sai, the speaker must further
        choose between possible (no realization) meaning      hope it
        might not', judgmental -ha-, infixed into sai, which carries a
        slightly stronger meaning of 'should not', or preventory infix

 'same/COMPLMTZR' there seem to be no significant differences in function.
The complementizer hix is optional in all relatives regardless of whether the
embedded sentence is finite (282) or non-finite (283).
   I have not recorded any examples of sigiai 'same' with non-finite clauses. If
it does turn out that this morpheme is associated exclusively with finite
clauses, it would be similar to certain complementizers in other languages (cf.
Lefebvre (1980:92) for a discussion of Quechua) which are only associated
with finite clauses.",[77]

18.7 Incorporation.      Although nonverbal elements normally may not be
incorporated into the verb (but see sect. 23), other verb roots are frequently so
incorporated. The process of incorporation is an extremely productive method                                                           Brought to you by | Cambridge University Library

Neither the incorporated roots nor the principal root allow affixation. Suffixes
are added to the entire stem as one element, (ii) Certain morphophonological
processes are undergone (cf. sect. 22). The most common of these processes is
the insertion of an epenthetic vowel, usually i, to avoid consonant sequences.
   I am not sure as to other possible restrictions on this type of incorporation.
It is common to find up to three roots in the same stem, although this would
appear to be the maximum. At times it is difficult to determine if a particular
element is an affix or incorporated verb root. The list below gives a sample of
some common verb stems formed by incorporation (incorporated roots preceded
by '+'):

          'cut' (emphasis on the movement)
18.8 Auxiliary verbs.      None have been observed.
19 Adjective phrase structure
   In sect. 15.3.1 it is noted that modifying phrases tend to be restricted to at
the most two constituents, although a few larger strings have been recorded.
The modifying of the adjective phrase head is either accomplished through the
affixation of one of two emphatic morphemes (-xi and -kof) or, in rare cases,
by reduplication. A few of the morphophonological changes which appear in
the examples that follow are discussed in sect. 22.

          field             big           big  xogii 'big' is common in this type of construction, although it is the only
adjective which undergoes reduplication in my data.
(390)    bigi hoigi-koi

         '(a) very dirty floor'
(391)    xiohoi xagii-xi
         wind     cold- EMPH
         '(a) very cold wind'   The emphatic morphemes in (390) and (391) may be interchanged freely
without affecting the translation. Further, these morphemes, along with the
singular case of reduplication, offer the only means of modifying the adjective
phrase head. One exception to this generalization may be xabaxaigio
Only/alone', found in phrases such as hoihi xabaxaigio Only one'. However, I
am uncertain as to the etymology of this word and since it appears, at least
superficially, to contain some verbal element(s), the phrase hoihi xabaxaigio
might best be considered as an existential clause such as, 'there is (only) one'.
The limited number of head-modifying constructions would appear to support
this hypothesis.
20 Adverb phrase structure
  Adverbs, like adjectives, are not modified periphrastically. Adverbs occur in
preverbal position, and the maximum number allowed in this (the oblique)
position is one.

18.3.5 Interrogative.      See sect. 10.
18.4 Person. Verbs are not marked for person (although I am investigating
the possibility that this may be, or once was, expressed by tonal suprafixes) in
the normal sense. In Everett (1983; to appear a; 1984a) it is argued that
pronouns (hi '3', gi '2', and ti T) in fact are used to mark subject
agreement. However, this argumentation is fairly theoretical both in form and
in its objectives and I will not go into it here.
  There is no marking on the verb of such semantic categories as reflexivity,
reciprocity, benefactive, animateness of participants, etc.
18.5 Voice-Valency.     The use of the nominalizer -sai to reduce the valency
of the verb is discussed in sects. 5 and 15.4. I have not observed any clear
augmentation of verb valency such as causatives, etc. (but see the final
paragraph of sect. 6).
18.6 Other categories.        The suffixes discussed here seem, superficially at
least, to have relatively little in common. However, I believe that all share the
feature of expressing the speaker's evaluation of the action, etc. expressed by
the verb. I attempt to justify this statement below. The suffix -taio
'REAS^IES' (sect. 18.6.1) forms the final positional class of verb suffixes
while the suffixes of sect. 18.6.2 represent the penultimate positional class. As
is noted in sect. 18.1.2, members of the same class-category may not cooccur.
18.6.1 Result, -taio.    This suffix expresses the speaker's opinion that one
action occurred as a result of another.
(369)   hi baab-ao       kaob-ap-       ä-        taio
        3 sick-TEMP see- PUNCT-REMOTE-RES
        'When he gets sick, he sees (the doctor).'

        1    fear   be      eat- ATELIC-NEG- REMOTE-COMPLETE CERT-
        taio
        RES
           am afraid and therefore won't eat (that).'
18.6.2 Conclusive aspects
18.6.2.1 Deduction, -sibiga.    When the realization of an action (past or
future) has been deduced, the speaker may express this evaluation through the
suffix -sibiga.
(371)   xigi    ai hi ab- op-ai             hi abaip- i- sibiga
        ASSOC be 3 turn-go-ATELIC 3 sit-                EP-DEDUCT
        OK, he's arriving. I deduce that he will sit down.'","[97, 98]"
"   Either the subject or the object or both may appear in postverbal position.
However, in such cases when two elements are topicalized (set off from the
rest of the sentence phonologically) the leftmost is interpreted as related to the
subject position and the rightmost to the object position (cf. sects. 2 and 9, as
well as Everett (1983)).
1.2 Intransitive Clauses.      Although it is common for transitive clauses to
appear without subject or object, the potential appearance of a direct object is
sufficient to distinguish this syntactic class from intransitives. (The verb xoab
'kill/die', see above, is an interesting borderline case. I am not aware of any
other similar verbs).

   Due to the fact that go 'WH' is marked with the oblique suffix -o and since
it follows the subject of the subordinate clause, as in (281), it seems best to
consider it as part of the VP (remembering earlier arguments to the effect that
the oblique suffix -o is assigned exclusively within the VP).
   As regards the actual construction of relatives, I consider them to have a
correlative type structure, e.g., [s[s][s]]·
   Finally, some observations may be made with regard to Keenan and
Connie's (1977) ""accessibility hierarchy."" According to this hierarchy, it is
predicted that subjects are more accessible than direct objects which are more
accessible than indirect objects, which are more accessible than possessor NPs,
etc. This implies that if a language relativizes a NP relatively low in the
hierarchy, it will also relativize all NPs higher in the hierarchy. Since Pirahä
only relativizes direct objects and subjects, it supports this hypothesis.
   A further expectation of this hierarchy is also fulfilled in Pirahä. Comrie
(1981) notes that the non-reduction relativization strategy is obviously more
explicit, in terms of the role of the relativized NP in the embedded clause,
than other strategies. We would expect that the more explicit strategies, e.g.
non-reduction, would tend to be used with less accessible NPs. At least we
might hypothesize that if a language has more than one relativization strategy it
will either make available all strategies for all relatives or the more explicit
strategies will be associated with less accessible NPs and less explicit strategies
with more accessible NPs. Since Pirahä has both an explicit strategy,
non-reduction, and a less explicit strategy, gapping, we would expect that (i)
both strategies may be applied to subjects and/or direct objects or (ii)
non-reduction will apply to direct objects and gapping to subjects. In this case
expectation (i) is fulfilled. Thus Pirahä at least conforms to these predictions.
15.4 Nominalizations
15.4.1 - / . The nominalizing suffix, -sai, has various functions. One of the
most common of these is the transformation of a verb into a nominal
expression, especially common in the description of novel or foreign objects.
This occurs both with transitive as well as intransitive verbs.

"  Although rising intonation is also associated with declarative sentences (cf.
sect. 22), in interrogatives such as (131) and (132) the initial and final points
of the intonational contour are lower and higher, respectively, in relation to
one another than in declarative rising intonation.
  This intonational marking is observed primarily in situations clearly marked
by the context as interrogative. In other cases, morphological markers are used.
10.1.3 hix.      This morpheme is considered to operate as a clause-level
interrogative marker. It is distinguished from verbal suffixes by phonological
and syntactic criteria.
   Syntactically, hix never appears to the left of verbal suffixes. That is, there
is no evidence in favor of incorporating it into the verbal suffix system.
   Phonologically, hix is the only CVC syllable in the language (and it is for
this reason that the glottal occlusive is analyzed in this position as a clausal
feature and noncontrastive at syllable level (cf. sect. 22.2). Moreover, hix
generally receives the strongest accentuation and highest intonation (occurring
rightmost in the clause with rising intonation—therefore a natural result, not
necessarily connected with hix itself) in the clause.
   Semantically, unlike other interrogative elements (except for -χόχόί, sect.
10.1.4) hix carries no implications as to content or form of the expected
answer. Being thus rather ""neutral"" semantically, it is not surprising that hix
is optional.

"  Another possible example of parataxis involving subordinate clauses is found
in quotational complements. Since a discussion of this type of parataxis
presupposes an analysis of quotational constructions, I will reserve this for
sect. 14.
2.2.3 Conclusion.      Phonologically, examples of clausal parataxis show
independent intonational patterns for each juxtaposed element.
   There is generally a pause between the joined elements. This pause does not
appear as consistently with phrases as with clauses. In cases where no pause
appears, it is common for the juncture to be marked internationally, with a
rapid fall in intonation followed by rising intonation at the constituent
boundary: (56) is an example of this.
3 Ellipsis
3.1 Omission of nonverbal elements of the clause.        As was mentioned
earlier, any of the nonverbal elements (subject, object, oblique object, etc.)
may be omitted. If we were to include a larger number of pragmatic
phenomena in our description, such as conversationally permuted structures,
then obviously it would be much more difficult to put restrictions on elements
which may undergo ellipsis. For this reason, the analysis of ellipsis presented
here deals with data from monologues rather than conversation.

10.2.1 go. All WH questions except for those with kaoi 'who/whose' are
expressed by the morpheme go. This element may have other elements affixed
to it (cf. below) to produce a series of WH questions relating to English
'what', 'where', 'why', etc. I have analyzed go as a type of adjective, in
terms of its syntagmatic positioning within the clause.
   WH questions with go are formed in the following manner:                                          o         'LOG'            -N         + hi '3'     + go +       {      xigi
                                          giiso
                                          giiso
                                                    'ASSOC'
                                                    'DEM'
                                                    'MAN'            J
                                                                      I  Other WH elements in the language are (i) kaoi 'who/whose' and (ii) so a
variant of go (the nature of this variation is still not clear to me although there
are various examples) as seen in

310                               Daniel Everett   These representative transcriptions show that exclamatives begin, as
declaratives, with a crescendo. This crescendo peaks more rapidly than that of
declaratives and is generally marked at its peak by two successive heavy
accentuations. At this point, the intonational contour drops very low, with
lowest intonation (and slowest rate, as shown) coinciding with these heavily
accented syllables. From this point on, the intonation rises much more rapidly
and steeply than that of declaratives. Note also the greater contrast between
peak and final speeds in these examples—very typical of this sentence type.
   In discourses marked by high emotional involvement on the part of the
speaker (e.g., a report on killing game, sighting of an aircraft overhead, etc.)
the prosodic features described above may range over larger syntactic units.
That is, several (syntactic) sentences may be grouped together, only one pause,
intonational contour, breath, etc., marking the end and beginning of the entire
set of sentences, rather than each individual sentence (which is a possible
argument for setting up both phonological sentences and syntactic ones). Also,
the intonational contour rises from the first sentence to the last, ending in a
falsetto quite often.
22.1.2 Phrase features.     As was the case with sentences, the description of
phonological features of phrases in Pirahä covers merely the grosser details,
leaving many details for future analysis. Also, as with the examples of
sentences, all data on phrases are taken from textual material.
   Basically, the (phonological) phrase is marked by an intensification of the
phrase final tone, phrase final position being marked by pause in most cases
(see beginning of sect. 22 for a discussion of degrees of pause, breath, etc.,
with the diacritic markings used in this section).
(418)   /poii          piaii
          arrow neck also
        'also (the) arrow neck'
(419)   /xi-    äooi xisoobäi
          wood-tip down (fine feathers)
        '(the) tip feathers'
                                +
(420)   /hi gai-sai           gaa
          3    say-NOMLZR thus(?)
        'he said thus'   In each example, the strongest accent ' ' falls on the stressed (see sect.
22.2.2 for discussion) syllable of the phrase final word; ' + ' marks the
intensification of the phrase final tone (high is raised, low is lowered).","[110, 111]"
"   Among other means of marking illocutionary force, emphatic suffixes may
also be used. There are three such suffixes in the language: -koi 'EMPH', -xi
'EMPH', -bai 'INTNSF'. The suffix -bai is only used with verbs, -koi and -xi
may be used also with nouns and -koi may also cooccur with -bai (cf. sect.
18.6.4).

22.3.1.2.2 Voiced consonants:         b bilabial; g dorso-velar. b is realized
optionally as a bilabial nasal following pause and as a bilabial vibrant
preceding o. g is realized optionally as an apico-alveolar nasal following pause.
Another allophone of g, [\], has been documented more completely in Everett
(1982b). This allophone is a double apico-alveolar/sublamino-labial egressive
vibrant. To my knowledge, this segment occurs in no other language. The
vibrant allophones are perhaps best characterized as 'nonsuperstrate'. Their
sociolinguistic implications are discussed in Everett (1984b).
22.3.1.2.3 Vowels:     i mid-high front; a low close central; ο mid-high close
back rounded, i ranges freely over mid-high front vowels [ι], [e], [ε], [i], o is
realized as a high close back rounded [u] after h or k preceding i. Elsewhere,
it is a mid close back rounded. All vowels are optionally nasalized following χ
or h.
22.3.1.3 Free variation.      Pirah grammar is especially marked by a high
degree of Optional rules' or free variation. Everett (1982b) discusses one case
of particular interest involving b and g. However, there is a great deal which
apparently occurs without any type of restriction.
   Besides those special cases mentioned above (p ~ pi ; s ~ s; b ~ b ~ m;
g ~ l ~ n), the following examples have been noted:
(i) In a large number of idiolects, p and k are interchangeable (cf. my remarks
on k earlier):
(452)   piaii ~ kiaii         'also'
(453)   xapai ~ xakai         'head'(ii) In an apparently smaller number of idiolects, p, t, and k are
interchangeable:
(454)   koxopai ~ koxotai ~ koxokai, etc.              'stomach'
(455)   tapai ~ takai ~ tatai, etc.                    [girl's name](This variation may occur in other positions within the word as well, as
indicated by 'etc.')(iii) In most male idiolects χ varies with k word initially (cf. sect. 22.3.2):
(456)   kosi ~ xosi                    'eye'
(457)   kohoaipi ~ xohoaipi            'eat'(iv) In many male idiolects (cf. sect. 22.3.2) s varies with h in word final
syllables (observed only in nouns):                                                               Brought to you by | Cambridge University Library

h before i and optionally elsewhere. Also, certain sociological factors affecting
allophonic distribution of g and b are not relevant (apparently) to female
speech (cf. Everett (1984b)).
   Female speech is more guttural than male speech. I suspect that this is
related to a contraction of the pharyngeal walls as part of the female phonetic
posture, although I have not pursued this matter due to cultural restrictions
discouraging women to converse with outsiders, as well as to lack of
instruments.
   Sheldon (p.c.) suggests that there are possibly syntactic distinctions between
male and female speech. Neither I nor my wife, however, have found any
strong evidence of this.","[116, 117, 118]"
"22.3.3.1.1 Deletion.     Word initial glottal stop is frequently deleted in
adjectives and verbs when preceded by nouns, pronouns, postpositions, or
modifiers (in verbs). This does not generally occur in slow speech (such as the
careful pronunciation common in elicitation). The parentheses in the following
examples indicate optionality.",[118]

"   Although my original definition of the referential aspects might appear
initially to lead to the conclusion that continuative and remote aspects are
incompatible, this is not correct. I believe that this association of the two
aspects is due to the fact that a continuing action is seen as somehow out of
the speaker's control. I have never observed anyone force someone else to stop
doing something that that person was engaged in. In (355) above, the speaker
is outside of the action, or so perceives himself, and thus the action is in this
sense ""remote."" Normally, when one wants to ask for help, etc. from
someone engaged in an activity, he says kabaobiso 'when you finish . . . .'
18.2.9 Durative, -ab. According to SS (1976:25), durative aspect refers to
"" . . . the actual physical presence of someone staying or remaining
somewhere or in performing an action . . . . "" As is seen in sect. 18.7
below, it is difficult to determine whether a verbal element is a suffix or
simply an incorporated verb root. In the case of -ab, there is a phonologically
identical verb root xab 'stay, remain'. However, due to the existence of
punctiliar aspect -ap in the same category (which does not seem to be a verb
root), I have considered -ab here as a suffix.

12.2.2 Negation of modifiers.     The form hiaba is also found in modifying

21.1 Sentence particles.     Although certain particles function at both the
discourse and sentence levels, there exist at least five which seem to function
exclusively at sentence level. These particles are discussed below. Three
particles which function at both levels are discussed in sect. 21.2.
21.1.1 Contraexpective, hoaga.       The particle hoaga (see also sect. 8.3)
expresses the notion of a frustrated, unfulfilled expectation. It would be
possible to interpret a sentence introduced by hoaga as a subordinate clause,
and this may be in fact the desirable analysis. In this case it would be more
appropriate to include this discussion in sect. 14. However, in my analysis
hoaga may also appear in independent sentences. Therefore, I do not feel that
hoaga is exclusive to subordinate clauses.
  Examples of hoaga in independent clauses are

   Pirahä is a member of the Mura language family, which also included the
now (probably) extinct dialects of Bohura, Yahähi, Mura, and, possibly, Tora.
The language has generally been referred to in Portuguese and English
literature as Mura-Piraha. I have avoided use of this larger term here, since it
tends to obscure the distinction between the language family and the language
itself. This decision also reflects the preferences of most Brazilian linguists.
   Although tentative classifications have placed the Mura family in the
Macro-Chibcha phylum, these seem to be poorly motivated; and I would,
therefore prefer to reserve judgments on genetic affiliation, considering the
Mura family to be still unclassified.
   Pirahä is spoken by approximately one hundred and ten individuals along the
Maici River, in the state of Amazonas, Brazil. The people are almost
completely monolingual; and though some have had frequent contact with
outsiders, for the most part they are unacculturated into Brazilian society.
Technologically, the Pirahä maintain an extremely primitive existence, using
few tools in their day-to-day living, aside from the bow and arrow, crudely
woven baskets, and aluminum pots purchased from outsiders.
   There are two primary settlements of Pirahä. These are separated by
approximately one hundred and fifty kilometers (by river). The village where
linguistic work has been done is slightly acculturated, being located close to
the mouth of the river and thus seeing traders, rubber workers, hunters, etc.
Unlike this group, the upriver village rejects most artefacts of outside culture
and is generally hostile to foreigners. Both groups are able to make many
artefacts and frequently do. However, the downriver settlement seems to prefer
to get by on the barest necessities, begging from passing boats whenever
possible.
   The research on which this description is based was conducted from January
to March of 1979 and from April through December of 1980. Further work
was carried on at various times (a total of about four months) with Pirahä
informants outside the village. The average workday in the village was two
hours of desk-elicitation, three hours filing and analysis, and three hours
memorizing vocabulary and conversing with villagers in a number of settings—
""perambulatory elicitation."" In total, the present author has had approximately
fourteen months of intensive contact with the Pirahä.
   However, various other researchers have contributed significantly to the
description presented here. I want to thank Arlo and Vi Heinrichs, Steve and                                                          Brought to you by | Cambridge University Library

however, for any errors which may have crept in despite their help.","[1, 2]"
"9.3.2 Proper nouns.      In spite of the fact that other Amazonian languages,
such as Satere (Al Graham, p.c.), tend to avoid the use of personal names or
proper nouns in discourse and everyday conversation, Pirahä relies heavily on
these to avoid ambiguity in discourse. Moreover, it is common to address
oneself directly to someone by that person's name (frequently abbreviated by
one or more syllables). Even children address their parents using their parents'
names rather than kinship terms (although the (loan?) word baixi
'mother/father' is common).
   In fact, no discourse would be intelligible without proper nouns to
distinguish the participants. A normal text of two or more participants will                                                           Brought to you by | Cambridge University Library

generally have a proper noun every other line— according to changes in time,
event, or participant in the context.
  For example, in (121) which constitutes the first lines of a text with four
participants, note the recurrence of the name of the initial character (a pattern
repeated throughout the remainder of the discourse).(121)   kohoibiihai    hi        ga- i- sai               hoasigikoi     kosoi

in the sense of Searle (1979). He defines illocutionary force as the        ""...
differences in the force or strength with which the illocutionary point is
presented."" Illocutionary point is defined as "" . . . the point or purpose of a
type of illocution. Illocutionary point is part of but not the same as
illocutionary force. Thus, for example, the illocutionary point of requests is the
same as that of commands: both are attempts to get hearers to do something.
But the illocutionary forces are clearly different."" Illocutionary force is
expressed morphosyntactically, phonologically, and by other factors. In this
section only the morphosyntactic and phonological means of expressing
illocutionary force are discussed.
   Repetition is especially common in imperative sentences, although it also
occurs in declaratives. To increase the force with which a command or
asssertion is made, it is common to repeat the verb phrase in a somewhat
paraphrased form (with changes in aspect, verb root, etc.).

"   In (22la), the first (most leftward) occurrence of hi '3' must refer to poioi,
whereas the second hi must refer to xahoapati. In (b), however, the second hi
may refer outside of its clause (interpretation (i)) or within its clause (reflexive
interpretation (ii)).
13.2.2 Observations on intraclausal anaphora. Pronominal anaphora within
the clause is expressed more frequently between a proper noun and pronoun
which establishes the grammatical or ""thematic"" relation of the proper noun's
referent to the action described by the clause.

          'Xaikäibai will teach, (and) then he will study.'",[59]
"   Note that in (218) the pronoun xi '3 INAN' refers to cloth, a rightward
antecedent. The (distal) deictic element gaihi 'that', however, refers leftward,
also to baosai 'cloth'. This is accounted for pragmatically and semantically: xi
cannot refer to ti T for semantic reasons (inanimate vs. animate), and gaihi
has no other possible antecedent in its position of ""clarification"" (cf. sect. 9
above).
   Pronominal anaphora is the principal way by which direct speech is
distinguished from indirect, as is seen in (219a) vs. (219b):(219a)    xahoaogii      hi    gai- sai      hi     kä        hoag-ao

          (ii)   'Xahoäogii said, ""I (i.e., Xahoäogii) have lead shot."" '   In interpretation (i) ti T is construed to mean the reporter of Xahoaogii's
speech, not xahoaogii. In (ii) ti is taken to refer to xahoaogii. This ambiguity
is resolved pragmatically. That is, the interpretation of such sentences
presupposes a disambiguating context, the syntax allowing more than one
interpretation.
13.1.3 Anaphoric function of discourse particles.         See sect. 21 below.
13.2 Syntactic domains of anaphora
13.2.1 Forward anaphora and backward anaphora (cataphora).                 Various
cases have been mentioned in which pronominal elements may refer to
topicalized elements, either leftward or rightward (cf. sect. 9). This type of
intrasentential reference is more restricted than intersentential reference in that
the latter is generally optional whereas the former is obligatory.
