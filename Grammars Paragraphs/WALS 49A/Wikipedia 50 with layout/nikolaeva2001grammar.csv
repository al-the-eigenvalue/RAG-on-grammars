4.2.2.2.1. Functions of the AccusativeThe Accusative noun phrase corresponds to the object argument of the
transitive verbs with different semantic roles: patient, theme, content, goal,
stimulus, etc. (14.3, 14.4). The case is inherited by the corresponding
(non-pronominal) argument in passive constructions, as distinct from English
and many European languages, both in the Passive (16.1.1) and Agentless
Passive (16.1.2). The Accusative (or the Dative) marks the causee in the
120 Noun inflectional morphologyCausative constructions (16.1.4) and the only argument of the objective
Resultative (17.2.2.5.2). It is also used to indicate the addressee of the
imperative in indirect speech constructions (18.4.4). The double object
construction is addressed in 16.2.1.
  A few nouns (13.6.2) and postpositions (10.2.3) take an Accusative
argument. Adverbial elements are marked by the Accusative if they denote a
span of time (15.4.2.6).","[153, 154]"

       SKX = Simonov, Kjalundzjuga, and Xasanova (1998-1999)The materials of the Northern dialect are cited using a phonological
transcription. This differs from the transcription originally used in the sources,
which was partly phonetic and in most cases employed the Cyrillic alphabet.
   Sentence examples are provided in phonological transcription with morpheme-
by-morpheme glosses and functionally equivalent English translations. Words in
the translations that are absent in the example are bracketed, except for personal
pronouns. For the sake of economy, the personal pronouns, which are not marked
for gender in Udihe, are all translated as 'he'. In the glosses the 1st person personal
pronoun is indicated as 'me'. Russian proper names, and other terms that remain
untranslated, are cited in the international transliteration system, while local
vili Prefacenames are transliterated into English as they are found in English-language
geographical reference books. For polysemantic Udihe words the glosses give the
meaning appropriate to the given context, so the same word may be glossed in
several ways. For example, the Udihe word egdi may be glossed either as 'many'
or as 'much', and the postposition edeisini may be glossed either as 'if or 'when',
depending on the context.
   Morphemes are separated with hyphens in both the Udihe text and the glosses.
Stems are glossed by English lexical words, while other morphemes are glossed
with abbreviations of category labels. When more than one English word is
required to translate a Udihe word, they are linked by a period. The grammatical
category that is not expressed by means of a separate morpheme is not reflected in
the glosses, partly for reasons of economy, and partly because the decision on the
presence or absence of the morphological null may sometimes be controversial.
However, when two separate morphs are contracted to one for phonological
reasons, this is indicated by a period in the glosses. Thus in the following
examples convention (a) will be used instead of (b), or (c).(a)    Sagdä-rji-mi     mo:      bede     ute-ne:-mi ( *— utene-e-mi).
       old-V-INF        tree     like     rotten.tree-V.PAST-lSG
       Ί grew decrepit like an old tree.'
(b)    Sagdä-qi-mi      mo:               bede     ute-ne:-mi.
       old-V-INF        tree:NOM:SG like           rotten.tree-V:PAST-lSG
(c)    Sagdä-iji-mi     mo:-0             bede     ute-ne:-mi.
       old-V-INF        tree-NOM:SG like           rotten.tree-V:PAST-lSGThe period is also used for those few ""portmanteau"" morphs that do not result
from phonological contraction at the synchronic level, for example, -li
<CC.SS> (Conditional converb, same-subject), and -lie <CC.SS.PL>
(Conditional Converb, same-subject, Plural).
  Examples that only make up a fragment of a sentence are glossed in arrow
brackets. In the translations of some examples we have included a grammatical
specification of the meaning in round brackets. This is not intended as a gloss,
but rather to facilitate understanding of the translation, for example:       zugdi-tigi        'to the house (LAT)' or <house-LAT>Unlike nominal stems, bare verbal stems are cited with a hyphen, for example
zìi:- 'saw' (a verb) versus zü: 'saw' (a noun). Embedded clauses are indicated
by square brackets.
   The grammar is intended to be a more or less comprehensive description. It
follows the traditional structure: general introduction - phonology -
morphology - syntax - texts - vocabulary - indexes. Much use is made of
cross-references between the various chapters and sections. The morphological
description is organized around inflectional and derivational forms. The
                                                                     Preface   ix
functions of some of these may be addressed in separate sections within the
corresponding chapters. The syntactic part is mostly organized around various
syntactic units such as, for example, the noun phrase, relative clause, adverbial
clause and so on, but in some cases we also follow the function-to-form
approach.
    The grammar is not biased towards any particular theoretical framework,
although in several cases we choose to explain within the text the basis of the
notions used in the description. The terminology is intended to be theory-
independent. The names of particular grammatical categories typical of Udihe
are capitalized; adjectives derived from these, as well as general grammatical
and semantic notions, are in lower case, for example, ""Possessive suffix"" (the
suffix of the grammatical category Possessive) and ""possessive construction"",
""possessive form"", and ""possessive meaning"".

                              Introduction
1.1. The Udihe language and its genetic affiliationUdihe (other spellings used are Udehe, Udegej, Udege, Udeghe, Udige,
Udighe, LJde) is a Tungus language spoken as a first language by
approximately 100 people, all over 50 years old, in the southern part of the
Russian Far East (see 1.2.3 for more information on the number of speakers
and 1.2.4 on its geographical location). Udihe is divided into two dialects each
with several local variants (1.3). Despite a lack of official status or written
tradition, several attempts have been made to create a writing system for use in
schools (1.6.2, 1.6.3).
   The Tungus (Tungus-Manchu) language family is widely assumed to be a
branch of Altaic. The scheme in (1) represents the classification of the Tungus
languages as accepted in Vasilevic (1960) and Sunik (1962: 16-20, 1968: 54,
1997: 154). The alternative classifications either group together the Manchu
and Southern Tungus languages (Cincius 1949; Benzing 1955: 9-10; Menges
1978: 370; Comrie 1981: 58) or treat Northern Tungus, Southern Tungus, and
Manchu as three independent branches (Avrorin 1959-1961). On some other
classifications and/or comparisons between them see Menges (1968: 25-30),
Ikegami (1974), Doerfer (1978), Vovin (1993), and Miller (1994).","[7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35]"

      ACC       mef(e)i-(-mef(e)i)       'each other'Morphologically, the Nominative is the reduplicated form of the reflexive stem
me(n)- and the Accusative goes back to its Accusative Plural form (9.2.2).
Reciprocal pronouns must be overtly present in a sentence.
   The Nominative reciprocal acts as the possessive modifier, while the
Accusative reciprocal functions as the direct object or takes other roles (for
further information see 22.4.1). Unlike the Nominative form of the Reflexive
pronoun, the Nominative Reciprocal does not occur as a subject or an object of
a postposition. It is used either as a possessive modifier (22.4.1.2) or
adverbially with the meaning 'separately, each by himself, and 'in different
directions', cf.:(604) a.    Men-e-men-e           bagdi:-ti.
            REC-O-REC-O          live-3PL
            'They live separately (each on his own).'
       b.   Bue-ti       men-e-men-e             qene:-ti.
            he-3PL       REC-O-REC-O             go.PAST-3PL
            'They left separately.'
       c.   Teu          men-e-men-e             wesi-e-ti.
            all          REC-O-REC-O             throw.away-PAST-3PL
            'They threw everything away in different directions.' (SKX 162)We also have a few examples where the Nominative Reciprocal pronoun
indicates the reciprocalization of an oblique object, see 22.4.1.1. However, they
do not seem to be regular.
   Note that in the Northern dialect as recorded by Simonov and Kjalundzjuga,
to the Reflexive pronouns may be derived not only from the reflexive stem
men-e but also from the stem za:- by means of the reflexive possessive affix -fi
and case affixes.

        b.   Za:-tigi-fi-za:-tigi-fi               ana-masi:-ti.
             REF-LAT-REF-REF-LAT-REF               push-REC-3PL
             'They force each other (to do some work).' (SK 310)
9.4. Demonstrative pronounsDemonstrative pronouns behave morphologically and syntactically as
pro-adjectives: they function either as an attributive modifier, or as a
nominalized element within a headless noun phrase. In a modifier function they
always precede the head noun and have the Nominative Singular form. On the
demonstrative noun phrase see 13.4. The oblique case forms do not function as
modifiers but are substantivized and take argument and adverbial roles. The
local cases are used as independent local pro-adverbs, which is the only way to
form deictic and anaphoric pro-adverbs in Udihe.
   Semantically, demonstratives are divided into two major classes, the
anaphoric-deictic class and the deictic class. Deictic pronouns cannot function
as textual anaphors, while anaphoric-deictic pronouns are used both in deictic
and anaphoric roles. In the latter case they have either resumptive or
discourse-linking function. In this section we only cite examples for their
deictic use, while section 22.1.2 presents instances of anaphora. For both major
classes two series are distinguished in terms of the distance from the point of
reference: proximal deixis pronouns and distal deixis pronouns. So, Udihe
demonstratives fall into four series.
   Demonstrative pronouns exhibit case inflection similar to, though still
somewhat different from, the inflection of nouns. The formal difference is
attested in the Lati ve case, in which the pronouns have two forms: with the
regular inflection -tigi or the adverbial Lative inflection -uxi, which is also used

                                   Syntax
Udihe is a head-final SOV language. However, head-finality is not rigid. In
some noun phrases, such as the possessive phrase, the head-final order is
obligatory. Other noun phrases demonstrate a split in head properties: in certain
constructions attributes may raise to the phrase-final position and receive some
other head properties (24.2.1.1). Postpositional phrases and non-finite clauses
are always head-final. In the matrix clause the word order is largely motivated
by information structure. The most important requirement for word order at a
clause level is the immediately preverbal position of the focus element
(including the question words) (24.1.1).
   Major grammatical relations, such as the subject, direct object, and indirect
object, are rather easily identified by a cluster of grammatical properties
(Chapter 15). In particular, the subject is a grammatical element associated
with the highest syntactic activity and is the main controller of coreferential
relations, both within the clause and clause-externally. The verb only agrees
with the subject. A number of rules that change grammatical relations apply
(Chapterló). The case marking patterns are uniformly based on the Accusative
system with the following two exceptions. First, the direct object marked with
the reflexive-possessive affix stands in the Nominative (22.3.2). Second, the
single argument of certain constructions denoting state may be encoded by the
Accusative noun phrase (17.2.2.5.2).
   The subordinate clause mostly makes use of non-finite verbal forms,
participles, converbs, and infinitives. Clause-chaining is organized around the
switch-reference system, which opposes same-subject and different-subject
relationships (22.5). They are morphologically encoded on the non-finite verbal
forms employed in the subordinate clause. Relative clauses are formally
patterned as attributive noun phrase (Chapter 19), complement clauses as
possessive noun phrases with participles taking corresponding case and
possessive affixes (Chapter 20).
                               Chapter 13
                               Noun phrase
A noun phrase consists of a head and an optional modifier. The following
grammatical classes function as nominal heads: nouns and pro-nouns (personal
pronouns, possessive pronouns, and indefinite pronouns, see Chapter 9). In
headless noun phrases the head noun is omitted, while cardinal numerals,
quantifiers, adjectives, pro-adjectives, and the relative clause undergo
nominalization. These cases are not treated in this chapter (on the headless
relative clause see section 19.5, and on the headless noun phrase see 22.2.3).
Pro-nouns do not take a modifier, with the exception of the relative clause.
Ordinary nouns may function as attributive forms only when there is a
possessive relation between them and the head. Some exceptions are addressed
in 13.7.
   The following classes of modifiers are available: pro-nouns (that is, Personal
pronouns), adjectives, pro-adjectives (Demonstrative and indefinite Pronouns),
quantifiers, postpositional phrases, oblique-case noun phrases, and the relative
clause. The relative clause is discussed in Chapter 19. Articles are missing, and
definiteness may be expressed by means of 3rd person possessive affixes
(4.3.1.1). Head nomináis cannot be modified by a simple adverbial. Adjectival
modification may also be performed by the derivational affixes -ziga (5.1.1.1)
and -ηΑ: (5.1.1.5).
   The noun phrase is typically head-final. However, under certain information
structure driven conditions the order within particular noun phrases is reversed:
the modifier occupies the phrase-final position and is characterized by certain
other head properties. This process will be referred to as ""modifier raising"" and
is addressed in 24.2.1.1. As shown there, modifier raising is observed in the
situation when the modifier and the head noun bear different information
structure statuses. In this chapter we will only focus on noun phrases that are
""neutral"" (not partitioned) from the point of view of information structure, and
that correspondingly do not demonstrate modifier raising. Yet, even in this
case, head-finality is not rigid. Certain classes of modifiers - the postpositional
phrase, the oblique-case noun phrase, and certain appositions - are always
postnominal, independent of any information structure considerations, so
head-finality is violated. Other modifiers (numerals and some other quantifiers)
may be prenominai and postnominal without being raised. The word order
within noun phrases with each individual modifier is discussed in the
480   Noun phrase
corresponding sections, while section 13.10 focuses on word order within a
noun phrase with several modifiers.
  The syntactic relationship between the head and the modifier is encoded
morphologically only in certain types of noun phrase: the possessive noun
phrase (13.1) and the phrase where the modifier corresponds to the indefinite
pronoun (9.6). Otherwise the modifier is merely juxtaposed to the head noun.
The only lexical material that may be inserted between the head and the
modifier are focus particles, cf.:(925) Sita-i           tene     bugdi-le-ni               su:ne:-k.

      'Bear fat is enough to eat in the winter time.' (SK 550)
4.2.2.2.5. Interaction of several factorsThus, the Accusative marker can be absent for semantic and phonetic reasons.
According to the semantic tendency, more fully manifested in the Northern
dialect, the Accusative case marking is likely to be absent in the direct object
noun phrase if it is: (i) non-specific (including generic and mass nouns); (ii) a
specific count noun not mentioned previously in the text, and therefore
indefinite. In all these cases, however, the morphologically marked Accusative
is not ruled out either, for example (160a) shows a non-specific noun phrase in
an object role which is inflected for the Accusative suffix -wA. Alternatively,
specific and previously mentioned (definite) noun phrases may sometimes have
                                  Functions of nominal inflectional categories 123a bare form in the direct object role, which can hardly be explained
phonologically, as in (160b).(160) a.   Onobie                       mamasa-wa           gele-i?
           how be.PRES.HAB              wife-ACC           look.for.-2SG
           'What sort of wife do you want?' (K 173)
        b. lrìei ikteme-ne:-ni           pauza.
           dog bite-DIS-PAST-3SG        roe
           'The dogs bit the roe.' (K 138)Of course, several of the factors mentioned can work in parallel. In (161) the
absence of the Accusative marker can be explained either by phonological
considerations (the potentially adjacent syllable beginning with /fl or /wf) or by
the non-specific/indefinite character of the object, or by its co-occurrence with
the Imperative verb.(161) a.    Omo          gagda qala-zi           oño                wo:-i.

            go-INF       elk      kill.PAST-3SG
            O n the way, he killed an elk.' (K 144)
4.2.2.3. The DativeThe Dative case marker is -du. The Dative expresses the semantic roles of
benefactive/malefactive, recipient, goal, direction, and the like. It marks the
recipient/benefactive/goal argument of two-place (14.3.7) and three-place
(14.4.1) verbs. In some copular constructions (17.2.3) the Dative corresponds
to the single experiencer animate argument of the experiential predicates (the
desiderative state, physical or mental state). A specific function of the Dative is
to encode the agent in Passive sentences (see 16.1.1) and the causee of
causative verbs derived from transitives (16.1.4.3.2).
   Furthermore, in spite of its conventional name, the Dative commonly
expresses a local meaning. In this function it may be interchangeable with the
Locative (see 4.2.2.5). Thus, in the valence patterns that require a Locative
argument (14.3.6 and 14.4.7) the Dative is also possible for a certain group of
verbs. As an adjunct, the Dative noun phrase can express the local relationship
(15.4.1.5) including those adjuncts that are very commonly found in existential
124   Noun inflectional   morphology
sentences (17.2.1.3), as well as the temporal relationship (15.4.2.1), and
goal/benefactive-type (15.4.4.2) adjuncts.","[156, 157, 158]"

4.1.1.2.1. Particularity of declensionFor the class Π n-final nouns, the stem-final Ini is not present in the
Nominative, Partitive, and Accusative (both in the personal and impersonal
forms); that is, in these cases the stem is vowel-final. In all other case forms,
the stem ends in Ini, cf.: xoto 'town (NOM),' xoto-mo (ACC), xoto-lo (PART)
but xoton-tigi (LAT), xoton-zi (INST), xoton-digi (ABL), etc. While quoting
the Π class words, η will be given in brackets.
   The following are properties of the class Π declension. Special case suffixes
are used in the Locative and Prolative: -dulA (-dilA) and -duli (-dili)
respectively (instead of the regular -IA and -li for the class I nouns). Class Π
nouns exhibit the Accusative suffix -mA instead of -wA as used by the class I
nouns (e.g. xu-me-ni 'smell' <smell-ACC-3SG>). In addition, the difference
between the class I and class Π declensions becomes apparent in the possessive
forms of the 1st person Singular and the 1st person Plural Exclusive in the
Nominative (see 4.1.4.1.1).
                                                         Nominal inflection 1014.1.1.2.2. Some historical considerationsAt first sight, the reason for such a distribution seems to be purely
historical-phonological. The oblique «-final stem is a common Tungus feature.
It appears that in Udihe (and other Southern Tungus languages) the stem-final
Ini is preserved before the dentals, since all case inflections except the
Accusative begin with a dental consonant (see 6.1.3). However, it is lost
word-finally (in the Nominative) and before the labial Iwl (in the Accusative) in
full accordance with the phonotactic rules of Udihe (Chapter 3). So if we take
into account only case paradigms, the distribution n/0 appears in the modern
language to be based on phonological grounds.
   However, several considerations arise at this point. TV-final stems are typical
not only of nouns, but also of other grammatical classes: verbs (7.1), some
pronouns (9.1, 9.2), postpositions (10.2), numerals (11.1), and adjectives
(6.1.1). For some of these categories the stem-final Ini behaves in a slightly
different way. Firstly, verbs show a distribution into two morphonological
classes: vowel-final stems (class I) and n-final stems (class Π). The class Π
verbs lose the stem-final Ini only before the old Past and Perfect markers -*JV-
and -*kV- respectively. However, in all other cases Ini is preserved, including
the occasions when it is followed by a non-dental consonant. The epenthetic
vowel -A- is then inserted to prevent an impossible consonant cluster, for
example: dian- + -mi -» dian-a-mi Ί say' <say-0-lSG> (see 7.1 for details).
Thus, in the same environment, in verbs epenthesis applies to prevent an
illegitimate cluster and not the deletion of the stem-final consonant Ini, as in
nouns. The same is true for personal pronouns (9.1.1), which exhibit an
epenthetic vowel after the n-final stem and before the Accusative suffix -wA,
for example, min-e-we 'me' <me-0-ACC>, although in this case an historical
explanation may be possible (see 3.4.1.1.1).
   For some groups of words Ini is also preserved in the potential word-final
position, and followed by an epenthetic vowel -A-, cf. the Nominative form of
the Reflexive pronoun men-e (9.2), and the bare stems of the class Π verbs that
follow the negative auxiliary (7.1), such as dian-a. According to this,
epenthesis is a more regular way to prevent consonant-final forms than the
deletion of the consonant.
   Finally, the stem-final Ini is not present before the nominal Plural suffix
-zigA, although it also begins with a dental, and the cluster nz is perfectly
legitimate in Udihe (Chapter 3), cf.: xoto-ziga 'towns' instead of the expected
*xoton-ziga.
   These pieces of evidence weaken the idea that the absence of the stem-final
Ini in the Nominative and the Accusative of nouns is conditioned simply by
phonological considerations. Note also that the n-final stems are typical of
certain morphological groups, for example, Past active participles that decline
in the same way as class Π nouns (7.5.1.1.2). These participles historically
ended in *xcan (Benzing 1956). Most personal pronouns (9.1) and Cardinal
102 Noun inflectional morphologynumerals (11.1.1) have n-final stems. This suggests that the distribution
between class I and class Π words may not have been entirely random.","[134, 135, 136]"
"
4.2.2. Functions of the cases4.2.2.1. The NominativeThe Nominative forms coincide with the bare noun stem, therefore the
Nominative is not indicated in the glosses. The Nominative noun phrase
                                  Functions of nominal inflectional categories 119typically corresponds to the subject argument of transitive and intransitive
verbs (Chapter 14) including (the pronominal) subject of the Personal Passive,
which encodes the patient/theme argument (15.1.1.2). On the syntactic
properties of the subject see 15.1.1. The Nominative is also the case of the
subject in most (though not all) copular constructions (17.2.2) and the only
argument of the subjective and sometimes objective Resultative (17.2.2.5).
Beside this, Nominative nouns have the predicative function (17.2.2.1.3) and
may serve as the (new or non-specific) direct object (4.2.2.2).
   The Nominative noun phrase functions as a modifier within a larger
possessive noun phrase (13.1); it is also used in appositions (13.8), in addresses
(12.2.1.1), and as a quotation and label form of a noun. A second or third
(essive) argument of a small number of verbs corresponds to the Nominative
noun phrase (see 14.3.9 and 14.4.8).
   Most postpositions govern the Nominative case, for example: teijku wei-le-ni
'on the stool' (see more in 10.2.3). Nominative forms are used in some
""frozen"" adverbial expressions meaning duration of time or location in time:
gä.r/a ineqi-ni 'all day long', dogbo ineyi 'through night and day', and other
analogous expressions of time (15.4.2.8).","[152, 153]"
"
9.2.3. Possessive formsLike possessive Personal pronouns, possessive reflexive pronouns are used
only in the non-attributive function, that is, mostly in the argument position
within a headless noun phrase (22.2.3) or as a final predicate. In the argument
position they take the case form of the corresponding argument, and in a
predicate function they are used in the Nominative.
   Morphologically, the possessive reflexive pronouns are derived from the
stem meni-, followed by the affix of Alienable Possessive -ηί- (4.1.4.4), and
then the case affix (which is null for the Nominative and the Accusative), and
the reflexive personal inflection (-i for the Singular and -f(e)i for the Plural).
The Nominative is identical to the Accusative and includes only the stem
meni-, the affix -ηί-, and the reflexive personal inflections. The Destinative
case is lacking. The paradigms of the possessive reflexive pronouns are:                           SG                       PL
       NOM-ACC            meni-iji:               meni-iji-fi

       INST             meni-qi-zi:               meni-yi-zi-fi
9.3. Reciprocal pronounsReciprocal pronouns (pro-nouns) have only the Nominative and Accusative
forms. In functions other than the direct object or the possessive modifier other
means are used to convey a reciprocal meaning (on the syntax of
reciprocalization see 22.4).","[375, 376]"
"
4.1.2.2. Collective PluralCollective plurality is expressed by the classifying bound word getu (4.2.1.3).
This word immediately follows the host target and cannot be separated from it
under any conditions. It is compatible with the animate nouns that denote
human beings, for example ñ'aula getu 'youth, young people', or lusa getu 'the
Russians'. It also indicates plurality in the impersonal forms of the active
participles, for example zube ni: xudei getu 'two merchants', isene getu
'audience' (literally: 'seeing ones') (see also 7.5.1.1); as well as in the
nominalized modifiers (adjectives, pronouns or quantifiers) within the headless
noun phrase (22.2.3). The bound word getu inflects for case and possession
while the host word remains morphologically unchanged, for example ñ'aula
getu-we-i 'your young people (ACC, 2 SG)'. However, we have one example
in which the host word takes a possessive affix.(132) minti sagda-nta-fi         getu
      we     big-N-lPL.IN        PL
      'our old men'   The bound word getu does seems to go back to the separate word getu
'friend, comrade, companion, relative' illustrated in (133). Also, a derived verb
getu-le-ne-gi- 'bring somebody' <relative-V-V-REP> behaves as other regular
verbs and takes a cognate object, as shown in (133b).(133) a.    Bi getu-i             anci.

                                                           Nominal inflection 1054.1.2.3. Possessive PluralNouns denoting persons take the Possessive Plural affix -nA-. It follows the
stem and is obligatorily followed by a Possessive inflection (134a). Class Π
nouns attach their special Accusative suffix -mA- after the Plural marker -nA-
(134b). Inanimate nouns do not normally take the Possessive Plural suffix -nA-.
When the Alienable Possessive affix -ψ- is present the Possessive Plural affix
-nA- follows it (134c).(134) a.   bi getu-ne-tigi:   'to my friends'
           <me friend-PL-LAT. 1 SG>
           sita-na-zi-ti      'with their children'

           <sister-PL-ACC-3SG>
           ami-ne-me-ni       'his ancestors'
           <father-PL-ACC-3SG>
        c. aziga-yi-ne-we-ti 'their daughters' (Schneider 1936: 103)
           <girl-AL-PL-ACC-3PL>   Schneider (1936: 103) hypothesizes that the Possessive Plural suffix -nA-
used to end in a consonant, presumably III (-nA- < *-nAl-). The evidence he
cites for this is that the 1st person Singular Possessive suffix used to appear in
the form -bi after the Plural -nA-. As mentioned above (4.1.1.3), in Schneider's
description this is a property of /-final stems. In the modern language the
/-declension is lost, and the Possessive -bi does not occur. Instead the regular
forms with the 1st person Singular Possessive affix -i, such as bi sita-na-i 'my
children', are found. Occasionally, the affix -mi is used in this function as well,
cf.: bi 'ai-ne-mi 'my brothers'. This may also indicate that -nA- goes back to
*nan (*nan + *bi > na-mi).
   The suffix of the Possessive Plural -nA- is formally identical to the
Destinative case marker (4.1.3) and shows a certain closeness of meaning (an
expression of possession). It has been suggested (Igor' Kormusin, personal
communication) that they may have a common origin (cf. the Russian
construction On mne brat 'He is my brother' literally 'He is a brother to me',
where the destinative Dative form mne 'to me' expresses possession).
Whatever their origin may be, in modern Udihe the Destinative and the
Possessive Plural are clearly different categories. Besides, they differ formally.
The 1st person Singular and Singular Reflexive Destinative forms are bi
sita-na-mi 'child for me' and (men-e) sita-na-mi 'child for oneself,
respectively. The corresponding Possessive Plural (non-destinative) forms are
bi sita-na-i 'my children' and men-e sita-na-i 'one's own children'.
106 Noun inflectional morphology4.1.3. CaseThe Udihe case system includes ten cases. A case inflection follows the Plural
suffix and precedes the Possessive. In non-possessive forms the case suffix is
the rightmost morpheme within the word. Some morphophonemic peculiarities
observed in the declension of possessive forms are addressed in 4.1.4.1.2. Case
inflection is fairly regular for all nouns, the only differences existing are those
between the class I and class Π declensions (4.1.1). The Nominative is
zero-marked morphologically and coincides with the bare stem for class I
nouns. For class Π nouns the Nominative form is vowel-final, that is, the
stem-final Ini does not appear. Likewise, in the Accusative and the Destinative
class Π nouns do not have the stem-final Ini, while in all other cases the class Π
stem appears in its full «-final form (see 4.1.1 for further discussion and
examples). The case suffixes for the non-possessive forms are presented below:                 I class                  Π class
       NOM        -                       -
       ACC        -wA                     -mA
       DAT       -du                       -du
       LAT       -tigi                    -tigi
       LOC       4A                       -dule (-dile)
       PROL      -li                      -duli (-dili)
       ABL       -digi                    -digi
       INST      -zi                      -zi
       DEST      -nA-                     -nA-   Under certain conditions, the Accusative case remains overtly unmarked and
coincides with the Nominative (4.2.2.2.2-4.2.2.2.5). The Locative and
Prolative affixes for the class Π nouns have two variants each, one with the
high round vowel lui and the other with the high vowel Iii. Their distribution is
conditioned by the tendency to assimilate the vowel Iii of the suffix to the Iii
vowel of the stem. Thus the variants -dile and -dili are normally used if the last
vowel in the stem is Iii (for example, amin-dili 'by the father' (LOC)), while
the variants -dule and -duli are used in all other cases (for example, xa-dule 'by
the brother' (LOC), namun-dule 'in the sea' (LOC), xoton-dule 'in the town'
(LOC), etc.). This tendency, however, is not absolute in both directions. The
Destinative case has a limited distribution: it must be followed by Possessive
affixes and cannot co-occur with a Plural marker. For more on the form and the
meaning of the individual cases, see 4.2.2.
                                                          Nominal inflection 1074.1.4. PossessivePossessive affixes attach to the head of the possessive noun phrase, the
possessed noun (13.1). There are two types of Possessive suffixes:
non-reflexive and reflexive. The Reflexive affixes mark the coreference of the
possessor with the subject of the sentence (see 22.3 for details), while
non-reflexive Possessive affixes indicate the lack of such coreference. The
Possessive affixes are located at the right edge of the word, after all the other
inflectional morphemes. Illustrative case paradigms for the possessive forms
are presented below in 4.1.4.3.","[138, 139, 140, 141]"
"(588) Ele     ele     e        bede bi-mi nua            muisi:-ni

9.1.1.2. Case inflectionPersonal pronouns take regular case inflections, the paradigms are presented
below.(589)        bi 1SG              nua-ni 3SG               bu 1PL EX

        LOC    min-dule          nuan-dile-ni             mun-dule
        INST   min-zi            nuan-zi-ni               mun-zi
        PROL min-dili            nuan-dili-ni             mun-duli
        ABL    min-digi          nuan-digi-ni             mun-dugiThe declension of the pronouns minti and bue-ti is not shown here because it is
completely identical to the regular declension of class I nouns (4.1.3). Although
the pronoun bue-ti, historically includes the 3rd person Plural inflection -ti, it
does not insert case markers between it and the stem; the case markers rather
follow the -ti. The pronoun bue-ni is declined in the same way as nua-ni, the
pronoun si is declined in the same way as bi, and the pronoun su is declined in
the same way as bu. Therefore these pronouns are not presented in the
paradigms either. The pronoun nua-ti 'they' typically behaves like
morphologically simplex; so its Accusative form is nuati-we. However, it may
sometimes decline like nua-ni, in which case the case affix is inserted before
the 3rd Plural marker -ti, so the Accusative nua-ma-ti is also acceptable.
   Two Personal pronouns have a suppletive n-final oblique stem. For the
pronoun bi Τ all non-Nominative cases are formed from the oblique stem
min-, while for the pronoun bu 'we (without you)' the oblique stem is mun-. In
the pronunciation of certain speakers the oblique forms of the pronoun bi 'me'
are ¿-initial under the analogous influence of the Nominative: bin-e-we
<me-0-ACC>, bin-dule <me-LOC>, etc. The pronouns si 'you (SG)' and su
                                                          Personal pronouns 335'you (PL)' have non-suppletive oblique n-final stems, sin- and sun-
respectively. All these oblique stems (min-, mun-, sin-, sun-) behave as class Π
n-final nouns (6.1.1) and take the same case inflections as class Π nouns. In the
Accusative the epenthetic lei is inserted between the stem and the case
inflections. In the other cases the epenthetic vowel is not present.
   For the morphologically complex pronouns nua-ni, bue-ni the 3rd person
inflection -ni follows the case marker. Occasionally, however, a form such as
bue-ni-we <he-3SG-ACC> may also occur. The 3rd person inflection may
sometimes be absent, but this is rather infrequent: nuan-tigi (LAT) (SK 622),
nuan-digi (ABL). The stem itself is also n-final (nuan- and buen-
correspondingly) and behaves like regular class Π stems: in the Accusative the
stem-final Ini is not present and the Accusative inflection is -me-, in other cases
Ini is overtly present before the case marker.
   Personal pronouns lack the Destinative case for obvious semantic and formal
reasons: the Destinative is necessarily accompanied by a possessive marker
which refers to the potential recipient of the Destinative object (4.2.2.9), such a
marker cannot attach to the pronoun, which bears a personal reference by itself.
Quite predictably, the Partitive is also lacking; the corresponding meaning is
expressed with the postposition gäundi-ni (see 10.2.1.3.2).
   In the Northern dialect as recorded by Kormusin (1998) the frequent absence
of the Accusative marker is attested for nouns (4.2.2.2). In the same way, the
Accusative suffix -we on the pronouns bi 'me' and si 'you' may be omitted.
The corresponding forms represent the oblique stem augmented by the
epenthetic lei: min-e 'me (ACC)' and sin-e 'you (ACC)', cf.:(590) a.    Min-e         baysal'a.
            me-0         kick.PERF
            'He kicked me.' (K 112)
       b.   J'eu         min-e nuykisi:       sil
            what         me-0 bewitch.2SG     you
            'Why are you bewitching me?' (K 113)
       c.   Bi sin-e     a:-zaija-i           ei-ke.
            me you-0 catch-FUT-lSG            this-CONT
            Ί will catch you anyway.' (K 180)Case forms of Personal pronouns have basically the same meanings as the
corresponding case forms of nomináis (4.2.2). As with nomináis, Nominative
forms can be used attributively, although they are often anaphorically dropped
in this function (21.1).
336 Pronouns9.1.1.2. Dual formThe oblique «-final stem of the Personal pronoun bi 'me' followed by the
element zuije 'two, in two, both' (11.1.3), which is phonologically bound and
acts here rather as a suffix, produces a complex form min-zuye Ί with you, we,
two of us'. Other pronouns are not attested in such a form. In the subject role
the word min-zuije requires a 1st person Inclusive personal agreement on the
verb, for example:(591) a.    Min-zuije   zugdi-du         amäsa:-fi.
            me-both     home-DAT         stay.PAST-lPL.IN
            'We stayed at home with you.'
       b.   Min-zuye    omo     skola-la         ñansule-fi.
            me-both     one     school-LOC      study-lPL.IN
            'We study with you in the same school.'","[368, 369, 370]"
"
6.1.2.2. CaseAs argued in 13.2, under neutral communicative conditions an adjective in the
attributive function does not inflect for case, so case agreement between the
modifier and the head noun is absent (exceptions are certain quantificational
adjectives, see 13.3.4). Adjectives take case affixes only when they belong to
one of the following syntactic types:
   (i) a substantivized adjective within a headless noun phrase (22.2.3);
   (ii) a discontinuous attributive modifier (24.2.1.2);
   (iii) a raised attributive modifier (24.2.1.1);
   (iv) an independent copredicative adjective (19.6);
   (v) adjectives in the Dative (14.4.1.2) and Instrumental (14.3.4.1) that take
an argument position;
   (vi) adjectives in the Dative that function as temporal adjuncts (15.4.2.1);
   (vii) adjectives in the Accusative in a copular complement clause with an
omitted copula (20.2.2.4).
Examples are presented in the corresponding sections.
   The functions of the cases and case morphemes are the same for adjectives
as for nouns (4.2.2). Most adjectives follow the type I declension, and only a
few quantificational adjectives (see 6.1.1) belong to type Π.
176 Adjectives6.1.2.3. PossessiveThe Possessive as a grammatical category is typical of nouns. Possessive
affixes on adjectives appear under special conditions:
   (i) The 3rd person Possessive affix -ni is present on the raised attributive
modifier (24.2.1.1); such a phrase then formally coincides with a possessive
construction (13.1);
   (ii) The 3rd person Possessive affix -ni may be present on the adjective in the
predicative function under certain communicative conditions (24.3.2.1).
Normally, the semantics of this construction presupposes a certain emphasis on
the adjective and/or a high intensity of the feature named by the adjective, and
the Possessive marker is the only means to signal this semantics.
   (iii) In copular complement clauses the copula verb may be omitted and then
the predicative adjective takes the Accusative case and the possessive affix
referring to the subject of the complement clause (20.2.2.4).
   Example (266a) illustrates the raised adjective, and example (266b) the
predicative adjective with the possessive suffix.(266) a.    In'ei         kuaja-ni          xukti-e-ni.
            dog           fast-3SG         run-PAST-3SG
            Ά very fast dog has run.'
       b.   Mäna          ge:-ni.
            flour         bad-3SG
            'The flour is (very) bad.'","[209, 210]"
"
9.1.1.3. Possessive formThe possessive forms of the Personal pronouns are: 1SG mini-rji 'mine', 2SG
sini-ηϊ 'yours', 3SG nua-ηί, ηιια-ψ-ni 'his, hers', 1PL IN minti-ψ 'ours', 1 PL
EX muñu-iju 'ours', 2PL suñu-rju 'yours', 3PL nuati-rji 'theirs'. As can easily
be seen, these forms are actually oblique pronominal stems, sometimes slightly
modified phonologically, augmented by the suffix of Alienable Possessive -ηί-
(4.1.4.3).
   Possessive Personal pronouns are not used attributively, but only occur in the
case position (argument or adjunct) within the headless noun phrase (22.2.3), or
as predicative elements in the copular construction (17.2.2.3). They inflect for
case in the same way as nouns, and their case forms have the same meanings as
the corresponding case forms of nouns (4.2.2). Used as predicative elements in
a copular construction, the possessive Personal pronouns are always in the
Nominative.",[370]
"
9.5.1. Interrogative pro-nounsTwo basic forms of Interrogative pronouns are j'eu 'what' for an inanimate
antecedent, and sometimes for an animate antecedent as well, and ni 'who',
which is only used for an animate antecedent. The pronoun ni 'who' takes case
forms completely identical to those of the almost homonymie noun ni: 'man'
on which it is based. These forms are the regular case forms for class I nouns
(see 4.1.3). Most case forms of the stem j'e- are derived as regular class I
nouns, with the exception of the Lative case which takes the adverbial
inflection -uxi, the adverbial Ablative in -zetjezi, and the adverbial Accusative
in '-/<?. The case forms are:(617) j'eu               (NOM)            'what'
      j'e-fe             (ACC)            'what; where, on which place'
      j'e-we             (ACC)            'what'
      j 'e-du            (DAT)            'where'
      j'e-le             (LOC)            'where'
      j'e-uxi            (LAT)            'where to'
      je-digi            (ABL)            'from where'
      j 'e-zeyezi        (ABL)            'from what side'
      j'e-li             (PROL)           'where (on which place)'The Destinative forms include different personal inflections, for example:
j'e-ne-mi 'what for oneself ,j'e-ne-fi 'what for themselves', j'e-ne-i 'what for
 you', j'e-ne-ni 'what for him' etc. There is also the locational noun j'e-ze 'what
 side', where -ze is a derivational suffix (5.1.2.4). Thus, the case paradigm of
 the pronoun j'eu exhibits formal similarities with the adverbial case paradigms
                                                    Interrogative pronouns 349(10.1). Other forms derived from the interrogative stem is the adjective ja-ma
'what sort of (-ma is an adjectival derivational affix, see 6.4.1.2.1), and the
noun j'eu-ze 'which side' (-ze is an nominal derivational affix, see 5.1.2.4).
   In quick speech the /¿-initial forms are often pronounced with an initial ji-
or simply as i:- (2.1.4.3). For example, the Dative form may be pronounced
either as j'e-du, or as i:-du, and the Locative form can be j'e-le or i:-le, etc.","[382, 383]"
"
9.4.1.2. Distal deixisThese pronouns have two stems in all case forms, namely with or without the
initial u-: uta-/ute/uti and ta-/ti:/tei. There is no apparent semantic difference
between the pronouns based on these two stems. The stems uta- and ta- appear
in the oblique cases, while the forms uti/ute (sometimes also uta) and tei/ti:
show up in the Nominative and are completely interchangeable as free
phonological variants.
   The ute/uti/ti:/tei pronouns are the regular means of textual anaphora in
Udihe. The anaphoric function of the pronouns ute/uti/ti:/tei is studied in
22.1.2. The local cases usually refer to inanimate objects, while the non-local
cases may refer to animate objects as well.
346 Pronouns  Like the proximal pronouns, the distal deixis pronouns in the Nominative are
used either as prenominal determiners or in the argument position. The first
case is illustrated in (611), the second case is illustrated in (612).","[379, 380]"
"
9.2. Reflexive pronounsReflexive pronouns belong to the class of pro-nouns. Like Personal pronouns,
they are also found in possessive and non-possessive forms and inflect for case.
Reflexive pronouns take as their antecedent the subject of the same clause and
are obligatory to express coreference with the subject within the clause (see
22.3 for syntactic details and the conditions on reflexivization).
                                                         Reflexive pronouns 3379.2.1. The Nominative formThe Nominative form of the non-possessive reflexive pronoun is men-e
'oneself in Singular and men-e-men-e 'themselves' in Plural {lei here is an
epenthetic vowel). In the subject function the Singular form is often used in the
Plural function, as subject agreement in number is not altogether obligatory in
Udihe (15.1.1.2.2). In other functions Reflexive pronouns are consistently
distinguished for Singular and Plural. The Nominative of the Reflexive
pronoun has syntactic functions typical of the Nominative forms of nouns: it
appears in the subject position, as a possessive modifier, and as the object of a
postposition.","[370, 371]"
"
4.2.2.9. The DestinativeThe Destinative case marked with the suffix -nA- has a rather limited use.
Generally speaking, it denotes either an object meant, designed, or destined for
a particular person or another object, or a destination itself. In the first
meaning, the destinative object noun phrase functions as a verbal argument
(16.2.2). This has the following two consequences: first, the destinative object
co-occurs only with a special class of verbs, namely, verbs of appearance and
creation (see 14.2.1.3); second, its form should contain a reference to its
potential 'recipient' (benefactive or goal). Indeed, as mentioned in 4.1.3, only
possessive nouns take the Destinative case; so the Destinative form must
necessarily contain a Possessive affix that agrees in person and number with
the potential possessor (benefactive) of the destinative object.
   In its second meaning, the destinative noun phrase functions as a clausal
adjunct (15.4.4.3). In this case it expresses the destination of the object
independently present in the clause and can be translated into English with 'as':
                                  Functions of nominal inflectional categories 127mamasa-na-ni 'as a wife for him'. Similarly, when used predicatively in certain
copular constructions (17.2.2.2.1) the destinative noun phrase denotes not the
object designated for a particular purpose, but the destination ('as something
for somebody'). The benefactive participant is cross-referenced by the
possessive affix on the destinative noun. Note that the Singular Reflexive
Possessive affixes on the destinative noun do not in this case have a reflexive
meaning, but are used to express general destination: kusige-ne-mi 'as a knife,
for the knife' <knife-DEST-REF>.","[160, 161]"
"
13.1. Possessive noun phraseThe most important formal characteristic of the possessive noun phrase is that
the relationship between the modifier (the possessor) and the head (the
possessed noun) is encoded by possessive affixes on the head. The only type of
possessive noun phrase where the possessive affixes on the head noun are
missing are reciprocal possessives (22.4.1.2).
   As distinct from most other noun phrases, the possessive noun phrase has a
fixed word order ""modifier - head""; that is, it does not undergo inversion
because of information structure.
   Noun phrases in which the modifier corresponds to the interrogative
pronouns (pro-nouns) j'eu 'what' or ni 'who' or the indefinite pronouns j'eu-ke
'something' and ni-ke 'somebody' are structurally organized in the same way
as the possessive noun phrase with a nominal modifier (see 9.5.1.1).
                                                     Possessive noun phrase    481
13.1.1. Pronominal possessive modifierThe structure of the possessive (including Destinative) noun phrase with the
pronominal modifier is as follows:(926) (Personal pronoun in the Nominative/Reflexive pronoun men-e) - head
      noun + (Alienable Possessive affix) + (case affix that encodes its
      syntactic role) + Possessive/Reflexive affix that cross-references the
      Personal pronounExamples:(927)    (bi)anda-i               'my friend' <me friend- 1SG>
        (nua-ni) anda-ni          'his friend' <he-3SG friend-3SG>
        (nua-ni) ja:-iji-ni       'his cow' <he-3SG cow-AL-3SG)'
        (men-e) k'olo-i           'one's mittens' <REF-0 mitten-REF>.
        (nua-ni) zugdi-du-ni      'in his house' <he-3SG house-DAT-3SG>
        (su) gegbeyku-zi-u        'with your berries' <you berry-INST-2PL>
        (bi) kusige-ne-i          'a knife for me' <me knife-DEST-lSG>
        (men-e) 'ana-na-mi        'a boat for oneself <REF-0 boat-DEST-REF>On Personal pronouns see 9.1, on Possessive affixes see 4.1.4.
   The pronominal modifier can be omitted under coreference, but is
recoverable from the context or the communicative situation (928). As was
discussed in 4.1.3.3, the 3rd person personal affix -ni can encode (situational)
definiteness. In this case the position of the possessor remains unfilled; for
example, (929) refers to sleeves of a dress, which in this case are definite.(928) a.     In'ei          ikteme-ne:-ni            pauza, ña:-wa-ni

7.6.1.1.1. Present active participlesPresent active participles are derived from the Present stem with the suffix -i.
For class Π verbs this suffix follows the epenthetic vowel -A-. For class I i-final
stems the participle suffix -i- is contracted with the stem final vowel into -/:.
Impersonal Singular forms coincide with the bare participle form: wakca-i
'hunting' <hunt-PRP>, dian-a-i 'saying' <say-0-PRP>. In the Plural the
impersonal forms take the Plural word getu, or - more rarely - -du-: wakca-i
getu 'hunting (PL)' <hunt-PRP PL>, dian-a-i-getu                    'saying (PL)'
<say-0-PRP-PL>. The negative auxiliary impersonal form is ei. An example of
the participle in the negative form is: ei jexe 'not singing (SG)', ei jexe getu
'not singing (PL)' <NEG.PRP sing PL>, ei noni getu 'not being able (PL)'
<NEG.PRP can-PL>, ei soijo-du 'not crying (PL)' <NEG.PRP cry-PL>.
   For personal forms different-subject affixes coincide with regular possessive
suffixes (or type IV inflectional affixes, see 7.2), for example: wakca-i-ni
'hunting       (3SG)'      <hunt-PRP-3SG>,      wakca-i-ti      'hunting    (3PL)'
<hunt-PRP-3PL>, etc. In the Nominative for the Is1 and 2nd persons the
personal affix is contracted with the Participle marker: i [unstressed] + i —> i,
for example: wakca-i 'hunting (1SG, 2SG)' (< wakca-i-i <hunt-PRP-lSG,
2SG>). In the 2nd Plural and 1st Plural Exclusive the participle suffix -i- is
missing, probably for the same phonetic reasons (i + u —» u): wakca-u 'hunting
(2PL, 1PL EX)' (< wakca-i-u <hunt-PRP-2PL, 1PL.EX>). In the function of
the same-subject affixes, the reflexive possessive affixes are used: -i (truncated
in the Nominative) for the Singular and -fi for the Plural. Examples: wakca-i
'hunting' <hunt-PRP.SS>, wakca-i-fi 'hunting' <hunt-PRP-SS.PL>.
   Personal forms always inflect for case. The case suffix follows the participle
affix -i- and precedes the personal affix. Case affixes are the same as for the
class I nouns (see 4.1.3) except that in the Dative case two suffixes are found,
-di- and -du-. In fact, -di is an assimilated variant of -du. It appears when the
personal inflection that follows it contains the vowel Iii (cf. 2.1.4.2). Thus, the
affix -di is found in all personal forms except for the 1st person Plural Exclusive
and 2nd person Plural, which contain the vowel lui and therefore do not
assimilate the Dative suffix. The regular morphonological contraction takes
place in the course of case inflection on the boundary of the case morpheme
and the personal inflection (2.3.1), for example: wakca-i-digi <— wakca-i-digi-i
230    Verbal morphology<hunt-PRP-ABL-lSG> Ί am hunting (ABL)'. For the same-subject participles
the Accusative forms are homonymous with the Nominative forms. The
illustrative case paradigms are presented in 7.7.
   In negative personal forms personal inflections attach to the Present
Participle of the negative verb: e-i-mi 1SG, etc. However, the behavior of the
negative forms with respect to the case affix is flexible in the sense that in the
syntactic positions that normally require case marking for the participle, the
negative verb often does not take the case marker. The case marker then
remains on the verbal stem. Compare, for example, (372a) where the negative
auxiliary has the case suffix (Accusative) marking the semantic role of the
relativized noun, and (372b) where the case suffix (Instrumental) is added to
the verbal stem and not to the auxiliary.(372) a.    Bi sa:-mi            gugda mo:    ei-we-ni

Non-Nominative forms express various ννΛ-questions in argument and
adverbial positions (23.1.1). In the subject function the pronoun j'eu 'what' in
the Nominative triggers Singular agreement on the verb, while the pronoun ni
'who' may trigger both Singular and Plural agreement. Apart from its regular
meaning ('to what'), the Dative form j'e-du/i:-du can mean 'why, what for'.
The pronoun j'eu 'what' in the Nominative also means 'why' or 'what for' (as
in Russian where cto 'what' can mean 'why, what for' in a colloquial speech),
cf.:(620) a.    J'eu        dieze-tigi       gaisi:-ni        min-e-we?

"""Stylistic variations"" in the length and quality of the word-final Iii (2.1.5) are
also conditioned by emphatic stress. The lengthened final Iii bears the primary
stress.
   In general, the emphatic stress and the presence of different styles of
pronunciation make the identification of stress exceedingly complicated.
                               Morphology
Udihe exhibits a rather high degree of morphological synthesis. The
inflectional grammatical classes have more than one morpheme per word. A
number of grammatical morphemes are semantically equivalent to separate
lexical items in the European languages, cf., for example, wakca-na-mu:i-
 'want to go to hunt' where -nA- is the Directive verbal suffix which indicates
movement in order to accomplish the action specified by the verbal stem, and
-mu:i- is the Desiderative affix. Yet a ""polysynthetic"" combination of a large
number of morphemes within one word is not possible. Theoretically, the
nominal word may include at most six morphemes (the root, the derivational
affix, the Alienable Possessive suffix, the Possessive affix, the number affix
and case affix), and the verbal word may include six or seven morphemes (the
root, three or four derivational affixes, tense/mood, and agreement). In practice,
however, such cases are rarely found, and the noun normally contains no more
than three or four morphemes, and the verb contains no more than five
morphemes.
   The morphological structure of Udihe is characterized by a certain level of
agglutination. Typically, the words can be easily divided into a linear sequence
of distinct morphs, each of which has a fairly consistent shape and a single
function. The agglutination, however, is not absolute; in many cases the
boundaries between the morphemes are not clear-cut, and several grammatical
meanings are combined within one ""portmanteau"" morph. This is mostly due to
the various morphological alternations described in 2.3. One example is the
frequent conflation of the /-final stem or affix with the following /-initial
morpheme. Thus, the 1st person Possessive affix -/ (e.g. anda 'friend', anda-i
'my friend') conflates with the preceding Iii within the Lative inflection -tigi
(anda-tigi-i <friend-LAT-lSG> —> anda-tigi: 'to my friend'). This creates a
'portmanteau' morph -tigi: which indicates both the Lative and the 1st person
singular. Some morphemes, however, have several grammatical functions, and
this is not a result of morphonological alternations (at least at the synchronic
level). For example, the suffix (')-si marks both the Perfective Converb and the
same-subject switch-reference relation (7.5.2.3.2).
   The only type of affixes found in Udihe are suffixes, that is, all bound
morphemes follow the root. Although synthesis predominates in the expression
of grammatical meanings, a few analytical constructions are present. Certain
aspectual, temporal, and modal categories are formed with the auxiliary verb
(see Chapter 7). Other morphological processes are reduplication,
98   Noun inflectional   morphology
compounding and conversion. Overall, incorporation is not typical; some
incorporation-like phenomena are addressed in 6.4.1.2.2, 8.3, and 10.1.3.1.1.
  The major open word classes (nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs) can be
easily distinguished by morphological and syntactic criteria.
                            Chapter 4
                  Noun inflectional morphology
Nouns are characterized by the grammatical categories of number, case, and
possession. Syntactically they function as arguments (Chapter 14), adjuncts
(15.3), modifiers (Chapter 13), or predicates in copular constructions (Chapter
17). The absolute majority of nouns in Udihe have the prototypical nominal
meaning: they denote physical objects, either countable entities or uncountable
mass notions. Very few nouns denote abstract notions, such as states, activities,
results or qualities, cf.: teluqu 'story\jexe 'song, singing', boko 'color', and
zima 'visit'. Normally words with abstract meanings correspond to adjectives
or verbs in non-finite forms.","[129, 130, 131, 132, 133]"

                    Adverbs and postpositions
10.1. AdverbsAdverbs function as verbal modifiers or clausal adjuncts; degree adverbs
modify adjectives, nouns and other adverbs. Udihe seems to lack a class of
sentence adverbs, with the exception of certain evidential (12.1.2.1) and
epistemic (12.1.2.2) elements. Certain adverbs function as predicates in copular
constructions (17.2.2.2) and some take sentential arguments (Chapter 20).
Adverbs are always optional in the sentence, with the exception of copular
constructions, in which they have a predicative function, and in constructions
in which they are used in reply to adverbial w/i-questions.
   Most adverbs are morphologically unchangeable, although some have a
transparent morphological structure and go back to nominal inflectional
categories (case forms). Case-inflected form a deficient paradigm, but each
member of the paradigm can be viewed as a separate lexical entry. Adverbs
derived or converted from nouns may preserve certain nominal properties, such
as being combinable with certain postpositions. In other syntactic properties
they contrast with nouns: adverbs cannot be modified by an adjective or a
possessive modifier, but only by other adverbs. A number of manner adverbs
formally coincide with qualitative adjectives, or are derived from them. Some
spatial adverbs have much in common with spatial postpositions, and are often
based on the same stem (10.2). However, unlike postpositions, adverbs do not
take nominal arguments that may be cross-referenced by personal inflections.
   This section is based on a semantic classification of adverbs: spatial adverbs
(10.1.1), temporal adverbs (10.1.2), manner adverbs (10.1.3), and degree
adverbs (10.1.4). The semantic classification is highly conventional because a
number of adverbs are polysemantic and render two or more meanings, e.g.
tuge 'quickly' and 'soon' (a manner and temporal adverb); go: 'far away' and
'a long time' (a spatial, temporal, or manner adverb). The adverbial derivation
is addressed within each particular section. Section 10.1.5 concentrates on
""frozen"" adverbial collocations; section 10.1.6 describes adverbial
reduplications. The general properties of the adverbial phrase are discussed in
 10.1.7.
   On adverbs based on pronominal stems (pro-adverbs), see Chapter 9.
Adverbial functions performed by nouns in different oblique cases are
described under 15.1.4.
366 Adverbs and postpositions10.1.1. Spatial adverbsSpatial adverbs with locative, lative, ablative, and prolative semantics are
derived from local cases of spatial nouns. Adverbs that denote the same
localization and form various series of related words based on the same stem
will be referred to as serial adverbs (10.1.1.1). There are no spatial adverbs that
go back to the Nominative, Destinative, and Partitive case forms, and some
other individual ""lacunas"" are possible. Furthermore, adverbial case inflections
deviate slightly from nominal inflections (4.1.3).(657)      nouns                  adverbs

        PROL -li, -dili           -li
        INST -zi                  -ziThe adverbial Ablative in -zA-rjAzi seems to be derived from spatial nouns in
-zA (5.1.2.3) with some kind of adverbial Ablative suffix. The Accusative
adverbial marker (')-fA does not coincide with the nominal Accusative
inflection, cf. w'e-fe 'above' and we:-we-ni 'top, surface, upper part (ACC).'
However, it is available for some adverbialized nouns, cf.: w'eh-fe b'äs'a-fa
'along mountains and rivers' (SKX 296). The adverbial Accusative forms in
'-fA can function as postpositions without personal markers (see 10.2.2). The
Ablative in -ligdeAlAgdA is attested only for a few adverbs. We do not have
enough information to deduce how its meaning differs from that of the regular
Ablative. As a rule the adverbial case suffixes tend to be replaced with standard
nominal ones.
   Non-serial spatial adverbs (10.1.1.2) are typically based on one 'frozen' case
form, and do not make paradigms.","[398, 399, 400]"

9.6. Indefinite pronounsFour regular series of Indefinite pronouns exist in Udihe: specific Indefinite
pronouns, non-specific Indefinite pronouns, universal (free-choice) Indefinite
pronouns, and negative pronouns. All of them are morphologically based on
Interrogative pronouns (9.5). In most cases the interrogative elements are
followed by the cliticized indefinite particles (on the definition of clitics in
Udihe see 3.5.3.1).
354 Pronouns9.6.1. Specific Indefinite pronouns Specific Indefinite pronouns are used if the referent of the pronoun is not
 known to the speaker and cannot be identified by him/her, or when the speaker
 does know the referent but prefers not to reveal it to the listener. Normally they
 correspond to the English Indefinite pronouns of the series some-, and to the
 Russian pronouns of the series -to.
    Specific Indefinite pronouns are derived from practically all Interrogative
 pronouns (pro-nouns, pro-adjectives, and pro-adverbs) by means of the
 indefinite clitic particle -kA or -kAi (these forms are free variants), e.g.: j'eu-ke
 'something', 'some', ni-ke 'somebody', adi-ke 'some quantity', imi-ke 'for
 some reason', etc. On the use of the particle -kA as a focus clitic see
 12.1.1.11.1. The indefinite particle occurs before the Accusative case
 inflection: j'eu-kei-we 'something (ACC)'. In the other cases it is located in the
 word after the case inflection, for example: j'e-du-ke (DAT), ni-zi-ke (INST),
j'eu-xi-ke (LAT), ni-du-ke (DAT).
    The following examples illustrate the use of indefinite specific pronouns
 inflected for the Instrumental (633a) and (633b), the Lative (633c), (633d), and
 the Ablative (633e).(633) a.    Nua-ni        ni-zi-ke                      dia-si:-ni.

"The possible formal patterns for expressing plurality of the head noun within
the adjectival phrase are as follows:(943) 'tall mountains' gugdawe:                             SG-SG
                       gugda-qku we:                        PL-SG
                       gugda-qku we:-ziga                   PL-PL
                       *gugda we:-ziga                      SG-PLThe nominal head, therefore, must control number agreement on the adjectival
modifier, although the head itself is not necessarily morphologically marked
for plural.
   Compound adjectives (6.4.4), pronominal adjectives, and some other
adjectives (6.1.2.1.1) do not take Plural affixes under any conditions. For such
a noun phrase plurality - if emphasized - may be expressed with the restrictive
particle m'ei (12.1.1.9.3). However, in at least two examples at our disposal, a
compound adjective bears the nominal Plural affix -ziga. Both cases involve
ideophones in the attributive position, which either precede or follow the head.(944) a.    xutam-ziga             buycau

488     Noun phrase13.3. Quantified noun phraseThe following quantifiers are observed: quantificational nouns (13.3.3),
universal quantifiers (13.3.2), scalar quantifiers (13.3.4), and numerals (13.3.5).
The regular word order within the quantified noun phrase is(945)    quantifier — head noun (+ case affix)A preposed quantifier has the bare form; the syntactic relationship between it
and the head is not encoded morphologically. The universal quantifier teu 'all',
as well as certain scalar quantifiers and quantificational nouns allow modifier
raising (24.2.1.1). Most scalar and universal quantifiers participate in the
quantifier float construction (24.2.1.2.2). Some scalar quantifiers and numerals
may exhibit agreement in (the Accusative) case with the head (13.3.6).
Together with the Accusative case agreement between the relative clause and
its head (19.2.3), this is the only instance of attributive case agreement in
Udihe. The number of the head noun is addressed in 13.3.1.","[521, 522]"
"
4.2.2.2. The AccusativeIn a non-reflexive noun phrase the Accusative is usually marked with the suffix
-wA- or -mA-. For the reflexive noun phrases the Accusative is homonymous
with the Nominative (4.1.4.2). The prototypical function of the Accusative is to
denote a direct object. On the definition of the direct object see 15.2. In the
direct object function the Accusative case is not always morphologically
marked, and even for non-reflexive noun phrases can sometimes coincide with
the Nominative. The issue is not entirely clear because the two likely causes of
this behavior, the phonetic and the semantic, sometimes work in combination.
In functions other than the direct object the non-reflexive Accusative is always
morphologically marked, but there is also a tendency to omit the Accusative
marker on the noun phrase that corresponds to the patient/theme argument in
Passive and Agentless Passive constructions (16.1.1, 16.1.2).",[153]

13.10. Word order in the noun phrase with several modifiersNoun phrases including more than one adjective are very infrequent, although
altogether not excluded. More than one attributive modifier of different types
may precede a head noun, though the number of such modifiers almost never
exceeds two at a time. When the head noun is preceded by two or more
modifiers of different types their position with respect to each other is as
follows: Demonstrative - possessive - quantifier - adjective - head. Thus,
Demonstratives always precedes all types of other modifiers: ei bi anda-i 'this
my friend' cthis me friend-1SG>. The quantifier precedes the adjective (985a)
but follows the possessive modifier (985b).(985) a.    zube sagdi guese            'two large pikes'
            <two large pike>
       b.   bi zu: ag'a-i               'my two brothers'
            <me two brother-!SG>Within the possessive noun phrase the adjective or the quantifier is located
immediately before its head, cf.:(986) Ñ'ádiga imexi zugdi-ni            'Nadiga's new house'
      <Nadiga new house-3SG>
      bi imexi uijta-i                  'my new boots'
      <me new boot-lSG>

      <girl nice friend-3SG>
      tuya aziga abuga-ti               'the father of five girls'
      <five girl father-3PL>
506 Noun phraseHowever, certain examples are attested where the adjectives that modify the
head noun precede the possessive modifier. Compare (987a) and (987b), where
the adjective tiije-fi 'yesterday's' can be understood as referring to the head
noun xokto-wo-ni 'his footsteps', although it does not precede it immediately.
Some other examples are (988).(987) a.     Wakca-i      ni:    sagdi kuti         xokto-wo-ni

                              Verbal valence
This chapter presents lexical and syntactic information on the valence patterns
of Udihe verbs. The adjectives that take a second argument are described in
section 6.3.3, which deals with the adjectival phrase.
   Valence patterns are presented in schémas that indicate the semantic role and
the formal encoding of each argument. This is represented in the form
""semantic role/case marking"". For example, the sign A/NOM means that the
verb assigns the semantic role of agent, and the corresponding argument is
expressed by a nominal with the Nominative case marking. The semantic roles
used in this chapter are largely conventional; the corresponding meaning
should be clear from the translation provided. However, we have found it
convenient to use several semantic labels to generalize the semantic content of
typical arguments. The following semantic labels will be used:
   A - agent (also includes experiencer, force, and other possible ""agent-like""
valences; corresponds to the single arguments of an intransitive verb);
   E - essive (secondary predicate);
   Ρ - patient or theme and the related roles (stimulus, mental goal, content,
etc.);
   Β - benefactive (includes recipient, goal, malefactive, and the like);
   C I R - circumstance (includes comitative, manner, instrument, means, and
the like);
   L - location (this role includes the whole range of spatial meanings, not
only the strictly locational but also the directional; their exact value is usually
clear from the case and postpositional marking of the corresponding argument).
   All valence patterns in this section reflect the direct voice constructions. This
means that the element with the semantic role of agent (A) corresponds to the
grammatical relation of the subject (see 15.1). Voice-related transformations of
direct voice constructions, as well as other valence-changing operations, are
addressed in section 16.1. The present chapter notes, for each group of valence
patterns, the possible transformations of the original direct construction, but
does not fully describe them.
   The formal marking of the arguments is mostly presented in terms of case
marking. The usual abbreviations are used for cases in the schémas, and they
may be found in the abbreviation list. Other abbreviations are also used in the
presentation of valence patterns. ADV stands for ""adverbial marking"". It
indicates that the corresponding argument can be expressed by a postpositional
508   Verbal   valence
phrase (mostly with a location meaning) or by spatial adverbs. For example, the
verb ijene- 'go' takes the agent and location arguments, the latter being
expressed by a nominal in the Lative case. This is rendered in a valence schema
as A/NOM, L/LAT. However, the postpositional phrase or a spatial adverb can
also express the second argument.","[540, 541, 542, 543, 544]"
"Since the head nominal within the clause is marked for case, its syntactic role is
indicated twice in the sentence. We only have examples of the Accusative and
Nominative noun phrases with postposed modifiers at our disposal. The head
noun controls the Plural marking on the postposed modifier, as in (1804b)
below. It is not entirely clear, however, whether we are here dealing with an
instance of attributive agreement, or whether the modifier is clause-external
and should be analyzed as substantivized.
   There seem to be two forms of modifier postposing. The first is motivated by
information structure considerations, namely, the afterthought status of the
postposed element. By ""afterthought"" we mean an element added after the
completion of the sentence to clarify an element of the clause, such as, for
example, sagdi bäsa-la 'a large river' in (1803a) or uti ninta-wa 'that man' in
(1803b).(1803) a.   Omo         bäsa    i:y-ki-ti,                sagdi      bäsa-la.

7.6.1.1.2. Past active participlesThe Past active participle stem coincides with the usual Past stem. This means
that for class I verbs it is formed by lengthening the stem-final vowel. Special
cases are the u- and /-stems where the following sound changes are observed: u
+ PAST —> uo:, i + PAST —> ie. For class Π n-final verbs, the Past stem is
formed by the element -ki which assimilates the stem-final Ini into Iql (7.1.2).
   The Impersonal Past Participle forms in the Singular are formally identical
with the bare Past stem; in the Plural they are followed by the Collective Plural
word getu, cf. wakca: 'who was hunting (SG)', wakca: getu 'who were hunting
(PL)' <hunt.PP PL>. Negative auxiliary forms are e-si <NEG-PAST> for the
Singular and e-si getu <NEG-PAST PL> for the Plural. An example of the Past
Participle in the negative form is e-si unti 'who was not drinking (SG)'
<NEG-PAST drink>.
                                                            Non-finite forms   231   Personal forms take personal suffixes that differ from the suffixes used for
Present Participles, namely they attach type V inflections: wakca:-mi 'who was
hunting (1SG)' <hunt.PP-lSG>, wakca:-mu 'who were hunting (1PL)'
<hunt.PRP-lPL.EX>. The same-subject inflections also differ: in the Singular
-mi is used instead of -i, for example: wakca:-mi 'who was hunting (SS SG)'
<hunt.PP-SS>. The Plural same-subject inflection is -fi: wakca:-fi 'who were
hunting (SS PL)' <hunt.PP-SS.PL>.
   Negative Past active participles in the personal forms are as follows: e-si-ni
<NEG-PP-3SG>, e-si-fi <NEG-PP-1PL.IN>, etc. The auxiliary verb 'be' has
the form bi-si-, which inflects for person and number.
   When personal forms inflect for case, the case marker follows the Past stems
and the personal inflection follows the case marker. When inflected for case,
Past active participles behave as nouns of the morphonological class Π: in all
cases except for the Nominative and Accusative the consonant Ini precedes the
case inflection (see Chapter 4 on nominal inflection). This suggests that, like
class Π nouns, Past active participles have an n-final stem, but Ini does not
surface in the Nominative and Accusative. In participles derived from class I
verbs there is no vowel lengthening, characteristic of the Past stem, before the
surface    Ini,    for   example:       wakcan-zi-ni    'who    was     hunting'
<hunt.PP-INST-3SG>. The participles derived from κ-final and /-final verbs do
not exhibit any vowel changes in cases other than the Nominative and
Accusative, for example:(373) Lalin-zi        bude:-ni.
      starve.PP-INST die.PAST-3SG
      'He died from hunger.'","[264, 265]"

9.2.1.3. Embedded clause subjectIn the embedded participial clause, namely in a relative clause (Chapter 19), a
participial complement clause (Chapter 20), or a participial adverbial clause
(Chapter 21), the Nominative reflexive pronouns can act as a subject
coreferential with the superordinate clause subject, although it can also easily
be omitted in this function.

            (Schneider 1937: 80)
9.2.2. Case inflectionReflexive pronouns are not opposed for different persons. Cases other than the
Nominative are derived from the stem me(n)- followed by the case inflection
(null for the Accusative) and the following personal inflections: -i or -mi in the
Singular and -f(e)i in the Plural. The Singular personal inflection -mi is found
in the Accusative and the Destinative; in the other cases the inflection -i is
used, which often contracts with the preceding vowel Iii (2.3.1). The inflections
                                                          Reflexive pronouns 341-i/-mi (SG) and -fle)i (PL) coincide with the regular reflexive possessive affixes
of nouns (4.1.4.2). As distinct from nouns, the Destinative forms are
morphologically based on the Dative case. The case paradigms of the reflexive
pronouns are:             SG                            PL
       NOM men-e                           men-e

24.2.2. Information structure in destinative constructionsIn the regular possessive destinative noun phrases in the object role the head
noun (the destinative object) encodes the person and number of the possessive
modifier (the benefactive) by means of personal agreement affixes, see 13.1.","[893, 894]"
"On discontinuous noun phrases see 24.2.1.2.
   Attributive agreement in case is absent with the notable exception of some
quantifiers (13.3.4), some types of appositions (13.8.2), and relative clauses
(see Chapter 19). Attributive agreement in number is obligatory only when the
head nominal is morphologically marked for plurality (13.2.2). In the ""neutral""
noun phrase discussed here the external syntactic role of the noun phrase is
encoded by (case) markers on the head noun, for other cases see 24.2.1.1.
   Below the noun phrases are presented according to the modifier types. For
apposition see 13.9.
   For the adjective phrase see 6.3, for the adverbial phrase see 10.1.7, and for
the postpositional phrase see 10.2.3.",[514]
"
4.2.2.5. The Locative4.2.2.5.1. Functions of the LocativeThe Locative suffix is -IA for the class I nouns and -dulAI-dilA for the class Π
nouns. The most common function of this case is to express spatial location
(location in/on/at/by something and movement into something, as opposed to
the Lative case which expresses rather the direction towards/to the object). The
Locative noun phrase functions as an argument in the clauses where the
predicate follows the valence patterns 14.3.6 and 14.4.7 and may correspond to
the patient/theme argument in the so-called Locative object construction
(16.2.4).
   As an adjunct it can express location (15.4.1.1), a point in time (15.4.2.2)
and, in its metaphorical function, the source of information (15.4.3.2), a cause
(15.4.3.3), and a group of which some member is involved in the situation
under discussion (15.4.3.2.1). Occasionally, the Locative expresses a possessor
in copular constructions, such as 17.2.1.3, although in the majority of cases
such constructions have an existential meaning and the Locative noun phrase in
them functions as a place adjunct.
                                  Functions of nominal inflectional categories 1254.2.2.5.2. The Locative vs. the DativeIn the local meaning (both as an argument and adjunct) the Locative noun
phrase is often interchangeable with the Dative noun phrase. The Dative vs.
Locative marking depends on the character of the noun phrase itself. For
example, some verbs co-occur with the following Dative noun phrases:
zugdi-du 'in the house', Bali-du 'in (the city of) Khabarovsk', kniga-du 'in the
book', kluba-du 'in the club'. At the same time, they co-occur with the
following Locative noun phrases: mo:-lo 'on the tree', namu-le 'at the sea'. The
word zugdi 'house' in combination with the verb bagdi- 'live' takes the
Locative if the house does not belong to the subject participant, cf. (162a) and
(162b):(162) a.   Bi xoijlo zugdi-le-ni              bagdi-mi.
           me other house-LOC-3SG             live-lSG

 10.2.1. Changeable postpositions10.2.1.1. DerivationChangeable postpositions go back to the possessive case forms of nouns.
Typically they are derived from the same spatial stems that are employed in the
adverbial derivation (10.1.1). Although for most postpositions the
corresponding noun is not attested in the modern language, in certain cases the
derivational relationship is still preserved. So some postpositions and base
nouns coexist, but demonstrate different categorial properties. In particular,
spatial nouns may take cases not typical of postpositions (the Accusative in
-wA/-mA, the Nominative, and the Destinative) and may be modified like other
nouns, which is absolutely impossible in the case of postpositions. As distinct
from nominal stems, the changeable postpositions never occur without
possessive inflections and case markers. Finally, nouns and the corresponding
postpositions may differ slightly in meaning, the meaning of the postposition
being more abstract, cf. examples (a) and (b) below.(744) a.    Bi moxo-i           kä:-wa-ni            xaji-e-ti.

4.1.1.2.3. Semantic groupsIn Schneider's dictionary (Schneider 1936) about 20 nouns are in class Π. All
of them appear to belong to the native Udihe vocabulary, and they mostly
denote very basic notions. In the modern language, they are even fewer. The
reduction is likely to be motivated by the ""analogy tendency"", mentioned
already in Schneider (1936: 93), which forces the generally non-numerous
class Π nouns to lose the stem-final Ini completely and be reinterpreted as class
I nouns. For some words parallel forms such as ami-tigi and amin-tigi 'to the
father' (LAT), xoton-du and xoto-du 'in the town' (DAT), belie-tigi and
belien-tigi 'to the fairy' (LAT) appear. The variations are found among
idiolects and dialects. Other words have completely undergone the transition to
class I, such as, for example, the common Tungus word *samän 'shaman'
(Cincius 1977: 59), which does not keep the historical stem-final Ini and
appears in the modern language as a class I noun sama.
   Among the class Π nouns a small semantic group of kinship terms is notable
for having special suppletive Nominative and Vocative forms (see also
12.2.1.3), while their case and possessive forms derive from a different n-final
stem:       Nominative       Vocative         declension stem
       abuga, amita     abuga-i          ami(n)-          'father'
       enitje           eniije-i         eni(n)-          'mother'
       nexuse           neyu-i           nequ(n)-         'younger sibling'
       ag'a             ag'a-i            ' ai(η )-        'elder brother,
                                 uncle; an address to a man by a child'
       exe              exe-i            exi(n)-          'elder sister,
                                 aunt; an address to a woman by a child'However, these two types of stem are often mixed in speech, and the
Nominative stem also sometimes takes the Plural, case, and Possessive
suffixes. For example, the old possessive forms, derived from the class Π
declension stem, such as ami-mi 'my father' and neyu-mi 'my younger sibling',
can be replaced by the possessive forms, derived from the Nominative stem,
such as abuga-i and nerju-i, correspondingly.
  The names of the local rivers Xu:(n) 'Khor', Ima(n) 'Iman', and Biki(n)
'Bikin' belong to class Π as well, cf. for example, the Locative form Xu:n-dile
'on the Khor'. This fact is reflected in the Russian form of the two of these
hydronyms ending in Ini (Bikin and Iman). But the variants that follow the class
                                                         Nominal inflection 103I noun declension pattern, such as Biki-le 'on Bikin' <Bikin-LOC>, are also
often used.
   The list of other nouns that generally preserve their class Π peculiarities in
the modem language is presented below.(131) xoto(n)            'town, city'    belief n)        'fairy girl'
      namu(n)            'sea'           xu(n)            'smell'
      kakt'a(n)          'half           koso(n)          'angle'
      ηαηηα(η)           'sky'           ogdo(n)          'slope, side' (SK 370)
      eni(n)             'female (of hoofed animals)'At the same time, grammatical classes other than nouns (numerals, Past
Participles, certain quantifiers and postpositions), do not show such a strong
analogy tendency if they belong morphonologically to class Π. Basically they
preserve the original class Π declension rather well.","[136, 137]"
"
9.1. Personal pronounsPersonal pronouns are pro-nouns in a strict sense, that is, their morphological
and syntactic behavior is similar to that of nouns. They inflect for case and an
(Alienable) Possessive. In a sentence, they take an argument position, or
function as determiners or adjuncts (rarely as predicates). In principle, their
overt presence in the sentence is not obligatory in most functions; for further
information on pronoun drop, see Chapter 22.",[367]
"
15.1.1.3. Control of switch-referenceMost importantly, the notion of subject lies at the center of the switch-reference
system which is addressed at greater length in 22.5 and illustrated in the
chapters on subordinate clauses (Chapters 19-21). In conformity with this
system, the non-finite verbs (participles and converbs) that form the
subordinate clauses of different types carry personal affixes of one of two
types: the so-called same-subject and different-subject. The former indicate the
coreference of the subjects of the superordinate and the subordinate clause,
while the latter indicates the lack of such coreference. The Nominative subject,
as identified in 15.1.1.1 triggers the same-subject switch-reference affixes
(examples can be found in 22.5), while other grammatical relations fail to do
so. Example (1068) indicates that the subject of the copular construction
controls the same-subject switch-reference markers (same-subject Perfective
Con verb):(1068) Oñ 'o-si                 aziga o-du                bi:-ni.
       [write.PERF-PC.SS]       girl     this-DAT         be-3SG
       'The girl who finished writing is here.'
538   Grammatical relations15.1.1.4. Refexivization controlThe Nominative subject controls reflexivization in the following two cases:
first, Reflexive pronouns in different syntactic roles (22.3.1.1), and second, the
Reflexive Possessive affixes (22.3.1.2) which indicate that the possessor within
the corresponding noun phrase is coreferential with the subject. Grammatical
relations other than the subject do not control reflexivization. See 22.3.3 for
syntactic detail.","[573, 574]"
"
4.2.2.8. The InstrumentalThe Instrumental case is marked by the suffix -zi. As an argument and an
adjunct, the Instrumental noun phrase can have a large range of meanings that
can be covered by the general label 'circumstance' or 'means' (the means
employed for the action). On valence patterns with the Instrumental case see
14.3.4 and 14.4.5. The Instrumental noun phrase can express the period of time
(15.4.2.4). As a manner adjunct it denotes means of conveyance, price,
instrument, circumstance, sometimes the cause, the way of transmission of
information, the source of information, or the material used (15.4.3). The
comitative meaning of the Instrumental noun phrase ('with somebody') is
common. The Instrumental comitative noun phrase functions as a determiner
within a larger noun phrase (13.6.1) or as a kind of a comitative adjunct
(15.4.6). Besides, it can mark the counter-agent participant of a reciprocal
situation (16.1.6.2.1, 14.3.4.2).",[160]
"
6.1. Inflection of simple adjectivesSimple adjectives either function as predicates (17.2.2.1.1), or in the attributive
function (13.3). As will be shown in 13.2, within a noun phrase which is
neutral with respect to information structure the adjective modifier is
prenominai and does not take any morphological markers except for the
optional Plural affix. When attributive adjectives undergo modifier raising
(24.2.1.1), they are postnominal and inflected for case, number, and possession.
When the head noun is not overtly present (22.2.3), or when the attributive
adjective is located discontinuously with respect to it, the adjective takes case
and number inflections. Independent adjectives in certain case forms function
as arguments (Chapter 14) and function as temporal adjuncts (15.4.2.1). Used
in the predicative function, adjectives inflect for number (17.2.2.1.4) and can
sometimes take possessive affixes (24.3.2.1).
   Information on the syntax of these constructions is provided in the
corresponding sections. Here we only describe the peculiarities of the
adjectival inflection.",[206]
"
15.2. Direct objectThere is some syntactic evidence suggesting that the notion of the direct object
is important in Udihe grammar. The element that can be identified as the direct
object is the noun phrase that is marked by the Accusative case and
corresponds to:
550   Grammatical   relations
   (i) the second (patient/theme) argument of the transitive verb in the
non-passive matrix and subordinate clauses (the transitive verbs which take the
direct object argument are addressed in Chapter 14);
   (ii) the patient/theme in Agentless Passive transitive constructions (16.1.2);
   (iii) the lexical noun phrase that corresponds to the patient/theme in Passive
constructions (16.1.1.2.2).
   (iv) the causee argument of intransitive and transitive causati ves (16.1.4).
The reflexive direct object is morphologically marked with the Nominative
case (22.3.2), but syntactically it behaves in the same way as the Accusative
object.
   Udihe exhibits double object constructions in which more than one argument
is encoded as the Accusative noun phrase (16.2.1). These constructions are not
very frequent, and the grammatical relations borne by their elements are
basically unstudied. Note however that both objects in such constructions
undergo passivization, as is suggested by the data from the Causative double
object constructions (16.1.3.4). In this section we will deal only with single
object sentences.","[585, 586]"
"
4.2.4.3.1. Inanimate nounsThe suffix -rji- encodes an associative relation through a different kind of action,
cf.: I:bene la:-ni 'a Japanese candle' and I:bene la:-yi-ni 'the candle given by a
Japanese'. In the former case, we deal with relational possessive constructions
such as those addressed in 4.2.3.2, and the 'possessor' I:bene 'Japanese' here
simply replaces a relational adjective. In the latter case the suffix -///'- indicates
138 Noun inflectional morphologythe situational relationship between the head noun la: 'candle' and the element
I:bene 'Japanese', both of which could participate in a hypothetical implied
predication 'a Japanese gave a candle'.
   This type of possessive construction is known in other languages (cf. the
English John's book, which can not only mean possession, but also ""the book
which John reads, edits, sells, etc.""), but is very regular in Udihe. In this case a
situational non-possessive relation is presupposed between the 'possessor' and the
head noun. The relationship can be established between virtually any two entities
associated in the discourse. The exact form of this relation is not expressed
overtly, and therefore the construction itself is semantically undetermined. For
example, bi abuga-i Μηα-ηί-ηί 'my father's deer' <me father-lSG deer-AL-3SG>
does not necessarily mean ownership, but may refer to 'the deer my father
followed, about which he was talking, etc.'. As noticed by Taylor (Taylor 1989),
the meaning of relation in this sort of construction can only be characterized in the
context of a person's encyclopedic knowledge of the relevant words (that is,
concerning typical actions involving the entity in question). It may also be added
that, at least in Udihe, the meaning of the construction is normally deduced from
the discourse; the context and the con-situation play an important role here, since
they usually set the type of relation unambiguously. Referential conflict does not
happen because, first, the type of relation is usually introduced in the context or is
clear from the con-situation; second, the possessor is highly referential and
definite, cf.:(185) a.    G'ai          uli-iji-ni                  xuili:-ni.

"
17.2.2.2.1. Destinative nouns in predicative functionThe Destinative noun within the copular construction predicates the destination
of the subject for a particular potential recipient (benefactive) or for making
something (goal). So there is an apparent semantic difference between such
constructions and constructions with Destinative Participles (17.2.1.2 and
17.2.2.4), which indicate that an object is designed for a certain activity.
Destinative copular constructions are found only in the 3rd person. The
predicative element is a destinative possessive noun phrase that encodes the
benefactive/goal. The noun in the Destinative case takes the possessive
reflexive suffix -mi in the meaning of general destination when the potential
goal is not expressed within the destinative noun phrase (1273a). When the
benefactive is expressed as a possessive modifier, it is referred to by possessive
affixes on the head, see (1273b) and (1273c).(1273) a.   Ei ñaktu mo:            saymiyku-ne-mi.

            'You have now become grown up.' (K 164)   We have at least one example at our disposal in which grammatical relations
are reverse: the destinative noun seems to correspond to the subject of a
copular construction, while a Nominative noun has a predicative function. This
follows from the word order and semantics of the sentence. Unfortunately, no
other material is available.

17.2.2.2.2. Nouns in the oblique cases in predicative functionA noun in the local cases does not itself have a predicative function. What is
predicated by such a construction is the local relation of the noun phrase to the
subject. The noun within the predicative phrase takes the Dative/Locative or
the Ablative. In the Dative/Locative it denotes temporary location (1275) and,
if it is animate, it can also express a woman's marital relationship (1276).(1275) a.   Anna         zugdi-du         bi:-ni.

"
15.1.1. Subject propertiesThe Nominative case form (15.1.1.1) and the ability to trigger verbal agreement
(15.1.1.2) unambiguously identify certain elements as subjects. These elements
will be called the ""Nominative subject"" and be treated as the prototypical
subject in Udihe. In subsequent sections we show that the Nominative subject
is characterized by a cluster of other syntactic properties suggesting that the
notion of subject is indeed relevant for Udihe grammar.
534    Grammatical relations
15.1.1.1. Nominative caseThe following elements are encoded as the Nominative noun phrase:
   (i) the first argument of the non-passive matrix clause (Chapter 14) which
corresponds to the only argument of the intransitive verb or the agent argument
of the transitive verb;
   (ii) the same argument in the subordinate clauses (Chapters 19-21);
   (iii) the pronominal patient/theme argument of the Passive constructions
(16.1.1); note that the lexical patient/theme of the Passive is marked with the
Accusative case and does not exhibit other subject properties (15.2.3,
16.1.1.2.2);
   (iv) the only argument of most copular constructions (17.2.2).
As shown in Chapter 14, most verbs take the Nominative subject, the only
exceptions being null-argument verbs (14.1). The Nominative noun phrase is
absent in Agentless Passive sentences (16.1.2), in Passive sentences where the
patient/theme is a lexical noun phrase (16.1.1.2.2), as well as in agentless
non-passive sentences (16.2.5).","[569, 570]"
"
11.2.2.1.2. Argument functionThe universal quantifier teu serves as an autonomous pronoun with the
meaning 'everything, everybody'. Examples (825) and (826) demonstrate its
use in argument position. In (825) it takes the subject position, while in (826) it
corresponds to the direct object role and takes the Accusative case.

"
13.3.6. Case agreement within the quantified noun phraseAttributive agreement in case in Udihe is limited only to the Accusative noun
phrases where the modifier is either represented by certain quantifiers (namely,
egdi 'a lot', wac'a 'little, few', teu 'all', zurje 'both', and the numerals), or, less
frequently, a relative clause (on this see 19.2.3). Within the Accusative noun
phrase the modifier that agrees with the head noun in case can be prenominai
(957) or postnominal (958). Note that the latter differs from instances of
quantifier raising (24.2.1.1.2) in two respects: (i) the postposed quantifier,
unlike the raised quantifier, agrees in case with the head noun; (ii) quantifier
raising operates independently of the syntactic position of the modifier noun,
while the postposed quantifier is limited only to the Accusative noun phrase.(957) a.    Egdi-we               gegbeyku-we      taji-e.

of the direct object, attributive agreement is normally absent. In the Northern
dialect case agreement is optionally allowed for an Instrumental noun phrase,
but this type of agreement is extremely rare.

13.4. Pronominal determiners within the noun phrasePronominal determiners within the noun phrase are the Demonstratives (9.4)
and certain other determiners (9.6). Pronominal determiners always stand in
preposition to the head. They never raise, and never show agreement with the
head nominal. In the absence of the head, Demonstratives may substantivize
(22.2.3). Examples of pronominal modifiers are presented in the corresponding
sections in Chapter 9.
  Udihe does not have articles. The numeral omo 'one' is often used as an
indefinite article, but is by no means obligatory in this function.(960) a.   Omo         belie    bagdi-e-ni            eitene.          Omo

"
9.4.1. Anaphoric-deictic pronouns9.4.1.1. Proximal deixisAs can be seen from the table in 9.4, the anaphoric-deictic pronouns of the
proximal deixis have suppletive stems: ei in the Nominative, a-, i- or o- in other
cases. The stem i- is likely to be the result of assimilation of the stem vowel to
the following case inflection, containing the vowel Iii. The stem ei can perhaps
be interpreted phonologically as ai or oi, since all non-high vowels are
neutralized to lei in the position before HI (2.1.3). In this case the pronominal
stem can simply be reconstructed as a-/o-, and in the Nominative it appears to
be augmented by a certain element -i.
   The pronouns of the series ei can be used anaphorically, although this is not
their main function and textual anaphora is more often expressed by the
uti/ute/tei/ti: pronouns (9.6.2). Examples of the anaphoric use of the pronoun ei
are presented in 22.1.2.
   Nominative forms can only function as modifiers or arguments of
postpositions, for example, the postposition bede 'like'.(607) a.    Ei bede e-u                         dian-a.
            this like   NEG-PRP.PAS             say-0

"
11.1.1.2. InflectionThe bare Cardinal numeral forms are used in the attributive (13.3) and predicative
(17.2.2.1.2) function. Besides, like most other modifiers, the Cardinals may be
used independently in an argument position (22.3.2). In the latter case they take
case inflections, cf. (790a) and (790b):(790) a.    Zakpu-ma      b'a-gi-e-ni.

which demonstrates obligatory attributive agreement in case (13.3.4).
   The numerals taqgu '100' and mitjga Ί000' have vowel-final stems.
Numerals from 'one' to 'ten' with the exception of zu:(be) 'two' and wei/weji
'twenty' have n-final stems and follow the declension regularities of class Π
nouns (4.1.1). The numeral zu: 'two' (typical of the Northern dialect) behaves
like an old noun with an Z-stem, that is, it takes the Accusative suffix -be (cf.
4.1.1.2.1). In the Southern dialects the secondary Accusative in -me has
developed, cf. the form zu-be-me with two Accusative markers, the old suffix
-be typical for Z-type stems, and the ""new"" -me typical for η-type stems.
""Double"" Accusative has been also attested in tuya-ma-wa <five-ACC-ACC>.
Other oblique cases are derived from the vowel-final stem zu:.","[454, 455]"
"
4.1.4.1.2. DeclensionIn the oblique cases the class Π nouns attach the same personal affixes as the
class I nouns. However, the case affixes themselves differ. The possessive
forms of both class I and class Π nouns use the case markers appropriate for the
corresponding declension (4.1.3). For example, in all persons class Π nouns
have the Accusative suffix -mA- instead of -wA- used in the possessive forms
of class I nouns, cf.: si nequ-me-i                  'your brother      (ACC)'
<younger. sibling-ACC-2SG> and si zugdi-we-i 'your house (ACC)'
<house-ACC-2SG>. In practice, however, analogous forms such as si
neyu-we-i 'your brother' (ACC) are also attested.
   In the recent past, the markers of the Dative could have two variations, -du-
and -di-. The variant -di- is normally a result of the assimilation of the original
Dative suffix -du- to the following Possessive suffix if the latter contains the
vowel Iii (2.1.4.2), for example:(137)     eniije-di: (< eniye-di-i)       'to my mother'
          <mother-DAT. 1 SG>
          in'ei-di: (< in'ei-di-i)        'to my dog'
          <dog-DAT.lSG>
          ti: αηα-di-ni                   'last year'
          cthat year-DAT-3SG>This fact is mentioned in Schneider (1936: 98). The assimilated forms were still
in use in the 70s, at least in the Northern dialect recorded by Kormusin (for
example, pauza dili-di-ni 'to the roe's head' <roe-DAT-3SG>). In the modern
                                                          Nominal inflection 109Bikin dialect, analogy is leading to the gradual disappearance of the variant -di
in favor of -du. Although the former can still be observed, forms such as
eniye-du-i 'to my mother' and in'ei-du-i 'to my dog' have become more and
more widespread. At the same time, the transitional variant of this marker -dii-
(with the high front round vowel) is also heard before Iii in the 1st and 2nd
person Singular Possessive affix (eniqe-dü-i 'to your/my mother'
<mother-DAT-1 SG>).
   On other regular morphonological processes which occur in the declension
of nouns see the section ""Phonological alternations"" (2.3).","[142, 143]"
"
 10.2.1.2.1. Case inflectionChangeable postpositions with a spatial meaning take the Dative, Locative,
Lati ve, Prolati ve and Ablative cases. They are formed with regular nominal
case suffixes of class I or class Π, depending on the stem type (4.1.1), although,
like for nouns, a certain inconsistency is observed, cf. xo:-lo-ni and
χo:n-dule-ni 'on' <top-LOC-3SG>. In the Dative the adverbial suffix -ni may
be present instead of the regular -du. The case forms have basically the same
meaning as for nouns (4.2.2).
   In the table below we present illustrative paradigms for certain spatial
postpositions in the 3rd person Singular form. The declension of other
postpositions is completely analogous. Lacunas are marked with a hyphen.",[436]
"
22.4. ReciprocalizationBy reciprocal we mean those constructions in which each of the participants
denoted by the subject noun phrase corresponds to two different semantic roles
(for example, agent and patient, agent and recipient, etc). In Udihe even the
oblique object and many adjuncts can reciprocalize: reciprocalization is
conditioned by semantic rather than syntactic constraints. The first antecedent
of the reciprocal, however, is always the subject participant.
   Reciprocal construction may involve a voice-driven verbal derivation,
marked with the suffix -masi- (8.2.1.1). Such ""morphological"" reciprocals were
addressed in section 16.1.5. In addition, the reciprocal meaning can be
expressed lexico-syntactically, by means of Reciprocal pronouns (22.4.1) or
syntactic reduplication (22.4.2), but without morphological changes in the verb.
The lexical reciprocal elements overtly indicate which non-subject participant
is involved in the reciprocal relationship. Lexico-syntactic reciprocalization
does not seem to affect the valency of the verb, while morphological
reciprocalization is often accompanied by a valency reduction
(detransitivization).
784 Coreference22.4.1. Constructions with Reciprocal pronouns22.4.1.1. Reciprocal objectThe reciprocal meaning can be expressed exclusively by Reciprocal pronouns
when the two semantic roles that correspond to these pronouns are the agent
and the patient. Thus the Reciprocal pronoun corresponds to the direct object
role. The object Reciprocal pronouns are mej\e)i or its reduplicated variant
mef(e)i-mef(e)i 'each other' (9.3). The subject may be the Plural noun (1617),
or the collective Singular noun (1618). In the latter case the antecedent is in the
Singular. The verb always takes Plural agreement affixes. The construction is
ambiguous because it can refer to any number of participants larger than one.(1617) a. Nua-ti       oymo:-ti                mefei-mefei-de.

"
22.1. Pronominal anaphoraIn the majority of cases both the matrix verb and the verb in the subordinate
clause exhibit agreement with the subject argument, at least in person (for
details see 15.1.1.2). The pronoun that corresponds to the subject is therefore
easily dropped (22.2). However, pronouns in other functions are normally
overtly present in the clause, and, under certain conditions, the subject pronoun
is also overt.
22.1.1. 3rd Person Personal pronounsIn this section we address the difference between the 3rd person Personal
pronoun nua-ni 'he, she' and nua-ti 'they', on the one hand, and bue-ni 'he,
she' and bue-ti 'they' on the other (see 9.1.1). Both types of pronouns refer
only to human entities, but they play different roles in the process of
maintaining coreference in the text. Both can be used cataphorically and
anaphorically.",[789]
