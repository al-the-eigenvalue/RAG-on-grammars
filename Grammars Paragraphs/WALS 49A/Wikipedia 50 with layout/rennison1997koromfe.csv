"2.1.2.6.1.3 Class marking in interrogative pronouns
The class marking in the interrogative pronouns was described immedi-
ately above in §2.1.2.6.1.2.2 - i.e. there is nowhere near the richness of
the noun class system. §2.1.2.6.1.3.1-2 are therefore omitted. Since
Koromfe has no cases and no other grammatical categories are marked in
the interrogative pronouns, §2.1.2.6.1.4-5 are also omitted.",[298]
"2.1.2.7.1.2.2 Details o/the differences
The only singular-plural pair to which the number distinction is relevant,
ala, PL. bcnama, displays class suffixes which can be analysed as being
extremely close the sg. [a], PL. [ama] variant of the 'human' class :Jlba.
However, the word bcnama is not *bcnama (which would be the exact
phonological form required for this nominal sub-class), and obviously, its
stem is different from that of ala.
    The word bEnama has a strong formal resemblance to the HUMAN
PLURAL determiner/demonstrative bEl]. However, since there are no other
comparable relative pronouns, speculations about the source of bcnama are
not going to lead very far.
    There is no class distinction in the relative pronouns, there is no case
in the language, and no other grammatical categories marked are in the                                                                                  265

relative, and the relative pronouns cannot be used adjectivally - therefore
§2.1.2.7.1.3-5 are omitted.","[300, 301]"
"2.1.4.3.1.3 Class and gender
There is no marking for class in the verbal adjectives. Nominal adjectives,
like all other nouns, belong to a noun class and have the corresponding
singular and plural suffix. Participial adjectives (formally the UNMARKED
form of the verb - i.e. the bare verb stem) are indeclinable.
      One nominal adjective, with the stem s:Jr- and the meaning 'other',
looks as if it inflects for humanness, since there exist two human forms
s:Jr:J (SG.) and s:Jraba (PL.) and also two non-human forms, s:Jragu (SG.)
and s:Jrahf (PL.). However, this is the only nominal adjective that I know
which marks humanness in this way, although there exist the interrogative
pronouns/adjectives ndeendI etc. and demonstratives ndendI and nandI
with this four-way distinction of number and humanness. The pattern of
s:Jr- is reminiscent of the deverbal agent and instrument nouns (i.e. with288
                                                               Morphology
HUM. SG. -5) in contrast with the personal pronouns and with ndendI and
nandI, which all have HUM. SG. dI.
    The determiners, which can be used as demonstrative adjectives, also
agree with their head noun for number and humanness (cf. §2.1.1.1 0.1).2.1.4.3.1.4 <7ase
Koromfe has no case marking anywhere.","[323, 324]"
"    This phenomenon involving k5N is the only case of conjunction-NP
(or relative-NP) inversion that I know of in Koromfe. The relative order of
the clauses is irrelevant. A further example of this inversion is given in
(125). Note the similarity with the topicalized subject in (123), which
seems to be the source of this inversion.
     The relative pronoun may not be within a pre-/postpositional phrase in
the relative clause (e.g. English/or whom or in which). This means that
(114) above is the only way to relativize a benefactive of a verb like 'give'
(which optionally takes the postposition ne).",[83]

                                Preface
This book is the result of 16 years of work on Koromfe, alongside other
linguistic interests. It would not have been possible without the active and
passive support of several people. I would especially like to thank my
family, who increased during those years from 2 to 5 (other) members, for
their active interest in the early stages and for their patience during the
final stages.
    Annemarie Schweeger-Hefel (t) put her house in Tulfes, Tyrol at my
disposal for my first informant sessions and provided me with background
information on the culture of the Koromba without which I would have
been lost.
    A grammar of this kind is never 'finished', especially for a perfec-
tionist like myself, and writing it has raised many further questions which
I wish I had the time and resources to try to answer. I thank my informants
for their help and Bernard Comrie, the series editor, for his extremely
attentive inspection of the manuscript and suggestions for revisions, which
were always to the point and well-received. Special thanks go to Oskar
Pfeiffer for his diligent proofreading of the manuscript. Of course, the
entire responsibility for what is written here is my own, and I absolve all

have exactly the same morphological shape as the subject prefixes of
verbs. The possessive adjectives never occur anywhere except the initial

modified by a NON-HUMAN SINGULAR DETERMINER, either kOlJ (short form)

2.1.2.1.1 Free (disjunctive) pronouns
There exists a set of free pronouns, which, generally speaking, can be used
in all syntactic positions in which any other noun phrase or clitic pronoun
can be used. There are also clitic pronouns (see §2.1.2.1.10 below). The
free pronouns (which I call 'DISJUNCTIVE PRONOUNS', abbreviated DISJ.
PRON. in glosses) have the same phonetic shape when used as subject,
direct object, indirect object or anything else. Formally, they are composed
of the clitic pronoun (as a prefix) followed by a stem b, which does not
occur as an independent noun in Koromfe. 73 Their forms are given in
(565).

2.1.2.1.1.1 Obligatory use offree pronouns
There is no case in which a free pronoun must obligatorily be used within
the basic elause structure involving a subject NP, verb and object NPs. In
cases where one of these NP is required for syntactic well-formedness
(e.g. as the subject of a sentence) a elitic pronoun can just as easily be
used.
     When a pronoun is emphasized or topicalized (cf. § 1.11 and § 1.12
above respectively), only the free form and not the elitic can be used. In a
nutshell: a elitic pronoun can always be used when it has something to
eliticize to (i.e. a verb for the postclitics and a noun, verb or postposition
for the proclitics); otherwise a free pronoun must be used.
     This holds for first, second and all types of third person (i.e.
§2.1.2.1.1.1.1-3, which are therefore omitted).","[272, 273]"

"2.1.2.5.5.2 Details o/the differences
It is not clear whether one should regard the demonstrative-pronoun usage
of the determiners as involving a class-like affix or not; if the first two
segments are considered to be a prefix, then the short forms have a 'stem'
consisting of a velar nasal [IJ] only - a very strange-looking stem for
Koromfe. The converse analysis is that the demonstratives have a pro-
noun-like stem,82 plus a suffix -g in the short forms and -gV in the long
forms (where V stands for a copy of the first vowel). The relevant forms
are given side by side in table (608) for comparison.

speakers are 'conscious' of these correspondences.

     Some of these words are similar to Moore words with a -gu singular; they may
     therefore once have had a g which has been lost historically.
60
     In Rennison (1986c) I give a more detailed account (with plentiful examples) of
     the semantic characteristics of the 'human class' and the 'basic non-human class'.
61
     The word saandre 'fatherhood', with a long aa, also seems to support this analysis,
     and to indicate that the word 'father' itself was probably once saa, with a long
     vowel, rather than present-day sa.
62
     The notations '(2x)', '(3x)' etc. mean that the same gloss appears twice (3 times,
     etc.) for different Koromfe words.
63
     This seems to be a very recent development; one of the texts in my collection
     contains ordinal numbers with the human singular suffix -;). Compare §2.1.6.4 be-
     low on the formation of the ordinal numerals.
64
     The origin of the human 380. pronoun d<J/dI is unknown, but cannot in my opinion
     be the de of the de/a noun class. Cf. the description of the personal pronouns in
     §2.1.2.1.
6S
     Because of the small number of its members, nothing conclusive can be said about
     the sub-type singular [lalJa] and plural [lao].
66
     Apart from the ubiquitous -fj suffix which can be added to virtually any singular.
67
     The word for 'chain', kerfe, is homophonous with the word for 'parrot'. My infor-
     mants claim that his is purely accidental, and that there is no semantic link between
     the two meanings.
68
     One informant suggested that the collective is used for these sexual organs in order
     to suggest ignorance of the precise details (which would be construed as polite and
     respectful).
69
     I was unable to elicit a long form from my informants, and none exists in my
     Koromfe texts. However, I would not be at all surprised if a long diminutive sin-
     gular form such as ke1Jge did exist.
70
     Here the word kalm5 'old' (used only for humans) is used in the sense of
     'deserving respect'. Note that it too has no determiner, and is therefore indefinite.
71
     Apart from the subject NP, this is virtually a repetition of the second part of (561)
     above; it is taken from the same text.
72
     This 2nd person singular pronoun is used as a 'special anaphoric' pronoun for the
     repeated 3rd person subject (cf. §1.5.2.2 above).
73
     This 'dummy' stem b is phonetically similar to the adverb b which means 'in any
     case'. However, it would be difficult to claim that the two are identical, since they
     can co-occur, as in m<Jb b 'I, in any case' or 'as far as I'm concerned'.
74
     The postclitic variants of the clitic pronouns must have a full vowel if phrase final;
     the proclitic variants, on the other hand, never need a full vowel for phonological
     reasons (though they may have one lexically, e.g. gu).
7S
     The free form is included here only for completeness' sake. It always consists of
     the prefixal form plus the 'dummy' stem b.
76
      On this point I have relied entirely on my informants' judgements, which is sup-
     ported by the sparse cases of plurals in my texts. Prost (1980) reports the same us-
      age, plus, he claims, the occasional use of the non-human singular gu referring to
      'God'; this my informants categorically denied. However, this whole area is clearly
      one in which further data from normal everyday speech would be of great benefit.","[401, 402]"

The element in the relative clause corresponding to the head noun is re-
placed with a relative pronoun. There are two types of relative pronoun,
which I will term specific and non-specific. The SPECIFIC relative pronouns
are quite marginal: the two existing pronouns (ala SQ., bEnama PL.) are
restricted to human NPs. The singular is formally identical to the corre-
sponding question word, but the plural question word, alama, bears no
resemblance to the corresponding relative pronoun bEnama. The NON-
SPECIFIC relative pronoun k5N is used in these and all other cases. Exam-
ples of specific relative pronouns are given in (111)-( 112) and their
equivalents with the non-specific relative pronoun in (114)-(115).","[80, 81]"

     I was unable to elicit a long form from my informants, and none exists in my
     Koromfe texts. However, I would not be at all surprised if a long diminutive sin-
     gular form such as kerjge did exist.
82
     Historically this is probably the case, though it cannot be upheld synchronically.
     The 3rd singular human pronoun is now dl, but was probably once :J
     (corresponding to the singular of the :J/ba human noun class). In Moore the corre-
     sponding pronoun is a and the corresponding noun class is alba - i.e. the pronoun
     and the noun class suffix are segmentally identical.
83
     Compare also the HUMAN PLURAL relative pronoun benarna, which seems to have a
     plural suffix -rna and a 'stem' ben which is very similar to the belJ of the deter-
     miner/demonstrative.
84
     The form I is found in the noun class system proper (i.e. on simplex nouns), but he
     is found on instrument nouns derived from verbs.
85
     There is some degree of phonological naturalness about the distribution of h here,
     since words beginning with vowels are rare and h alternates freely with zero in
     words like alb I halb 'stranger'. The velar nasal, on the other hand, has no syn-
     chronic source and I cannot put my finger on a diachronic one, even taking into
     consideration that it may be the reflex of go (cf. the -lJ singular variant of the gal!
     noun class).
86
     Of course, strictly speaking ase ni is not a separate question word, but simply a
     variant of ase 'what'. For 'why' with a resultative rather than purposive meaning,
     the construction ase la pa ke ... 'what gave (i.e. resulted in) (the fact) that...' is used.
87
     The word given here as wa(lJ)katl occurs both with and without lJ. The vowel pre-
     ceding lJ can also be nasal. This seems to be a case of speaker-specific free varia-
     tion.
88
     There also exists a causative verb hibs- from the same stem with the -s suffix.
89
     The agent noun derived from this causative verb, holagr:J, is the normal term for
      'midwife'.
90
     The final vowels given in parentheses in some of the UNMARKED and DURATIVE
     forms are fully harmonized and therefore, I claim, not lexically present. They
     emerge phonetically in phrase-final position only. In all other positions either
      schwa or nothing is heard, depending on context, tempo, casualness, etc. These
     phonological processes are quite general for non-lexical vowels.
91
      The environment 'after nasal consonants' is only applicable to the DURATIVE, since
      UNMARKED forms with a nasal-final stem do not require an 'epenthetic' final
     vowel.

"2.1.4.6 Expression of the categories that characterize the verbal

2.1.4.6.1 In the a4jective morphology
The 'categories that characterize the verbal morphology of the language'
are the four tense/aspect forms of the verb. These are never expressed on a
nominal adjective, but with verbal adjectives the question is quite difficult.
     There is a considerable problem of elicitation in the area of verbal ad-
jectives when using French (which has few verbal adjectives) as the
working language. In addition, Koromfe has nominal adjectives available
in most cases, and I found that informants often resorted to these when the
going got rough.
     Nevertheless, I think that each true verbal adjective has only a single
morphological form, usually ending in long -aa like the PROGRESSIVE verb
forms and subject to the same shortening processes. The time reference of
such a verbal adjective is present unless modified by an adverb of time
(which can make it refer to past or future time). A list of most of the un-
equivocal verbal adjectives in my corpus is given in (667); words de-
scribing human body positions (sitting, standing, crouching, etc.) have
been omitted, since I consider these to be normal intransitive verbs. 106

This class has the singular suffix -go and the plural suffix -I. However,

   The range of phonetic realizations of the -go suffix is [gu], [ku], [VIJ]
(where V is a non':'high harmonized vowel), plus the corresponding ATR-
harmonized variants;36 the plural suffix -/ has no unexpected phonetic
realizations apart from the usual (and quite regular) vowel harmony, na-
salization and post-nasal lowering to a mid vowel -e.
    The suffixes -go and -/ are identical with the 3rd person non-human
personal pronouns go (SG.) and / (PL.) in their prefix form. The suffix form
of the pronoun is identical in the SINGULAR, but in the PLURAL is hE (which
is the PLURAL suffix of the instrument nouns derived from verbs, and
probably historically identical with I). Note; however, that the non-human
pronouns go, / and hE are used to refer to all non-human nouns, even if the
noun itself has a different class suffix.
    Again, for completeness' sake I must also mention the clear pho-
nological resemblance between these class suffixes and a) the NON-HUMAN
DETERMINERS k01J (SG.) and hE1J (PL.) (with their respective long forms

"1.12.2.3.4 No marking
If the topicalized NP originated as a constituent of the sentence, then its
source position must be marked with a pronoun. However, if the problem
cases in §1.11.2.2.1.1, examples (333)-(336) above, are analysed as topi-
calization rather than emphasis, then no marking of the source position of
the moved NP occurs.",[177]

      '(bottle) openers' from sumbot- 'open'. However, -hi without ATR is not found.
      Phonologically this behaviour parallels the locative postposition nt:, which can be
      ne or ni with ATR, but never n1 without ATR.
123   The LOCATION noun derived with the suffix -fa can always be pluralized by the
      addition of the 'default' plural suffix -Ii, producing in this case tufaftlfi 'seat (PL.)'
      - a pattern which can be found with the DURATIVE stem of any verb for which a
      plural LOCATION noun is semantically plausible.
124   The instrument plural suffix -hE comes closest to being unique to derived nouns,
      but is also the suffixal clitic non-human plural pronoun.
125   Although I have not personally conducted a search, Manessy (1969) gives no
      pronoun forms comparable to daldI for other Gur languages. In the related lan-
      guage Moore, where the noun class suffix is -a instead of -:J, there is complete
      agreement between the underived human class suffix, the agent noun suffix and the
      (short) clitic subject and object pronoun: all are a.
126   This gap is only on the content side, since formally there does exist a pronoun
      suffix nt: (phonologically indistinguishable from n1 since high vowels frequently
      lower to mid word-finally), which is the 2nd person singular postclitic pronoun.
127   This verb occurs only with a DURATIVE stem in my corpus - probably for semantic
      reasons, since it denotes a more permanent kind of possession.
128   The derivation of such action nouns from verbs is also idiosyncratic in the related
      local language Moore, but even more so: there is no regular derivation corre-
      sponding to Koromfe -am.
129
      This verb is defective, having no other inflectional forms apart from the unmarked
      form 1Jgo given here.
130   The plural with -Ii is given here only to indicate that it is also used for the concrete
      reading of this noun. A plural in -Ii can always be formed from any singular noun
      in Koromfe.
13l   The base verb hom- has undergone semantic shift to a specific activity which gen-
      erates heat. Compare the related words homnM (verbal adjective) 'be hot' and
      homs- (verb, from Ihom+sl) 'heat'.
132   There also exists no verbal adjective *d:Jnamaa. Note also that the second d of
      d:Jnda is arguably a verbal-adjective-forming suffix (cf. §2.2.2.2 below).
133   There exists no verbal adjective *p:Jtamaa (i.e. Ip:Jt+m+aa/ which ought to involve
      the same intermediate stem as the derived noun p:Jtmle.
134   There is no nominal adjective, or indeed any other word, formed from this stem.
135   My informants expressed their intuition quite clearly that 'marry (a woman)' and
      'plunder' were two facets of the same meaning. The other verb for 'marry (a
      woman)' has the primary meaning 'pull (by the hand)'. The two verbs meaning
      'marry (a man)' have the primary meanings 'return home (INTRANS.)' and 'take,
      pick up'.
136
      Only the PROGRESSIVE form has been omitted to save space; it exists for all and
      only those verbs in (731) which have a DURATIVE form, and is formed by adding an
      -aa suffix to the DURATIVE (and dropping the phrase-final vowel given in parenthe-
      ses).","[405, 406]"
"2.1.2.1.1.3.3 Non-emphatic contexts with imperative verbs
No pronoun normally occurs with unemphatic singular 2nd person im-
peratives. In plural 2nd person imperatives, the proclitic subject pronoun
na and the verb are inverted. However, inversion with the free 2nd plural
pronoun nab is impossible. This is the only case I know of in Koromfe
where a free pronoun is not interchangeable with the equivalent clitic
pronoun.",[274]

"Koromfe
Strong linguistic and ecological pressures are gradually pushing Koromfe,
a local language spoken in the north of Burkina Faso, West Africa, towards
extinction. Spoken by, at the most, 10,000 people, Koromfe has defied
political and cultural domination by other local languages.
   Few other researchers have studied Koromfe in such depth and this is the
first detailed linguistical analysis of its kind, consequently providing data
which sheds light on many previously unanswered questions concerning both
Koromfe and genetic and general linguistic issues. The information which
constitutes this De.scriptive Grammar is based on field work conducted by the
author. As a Gur or Voltaic language, the author shows how Koromfe shares
many phonological, lexical, morphologi<;al and syntactic affinities with other
such languages.
John R. Rennison is currently Senior Lecturer in Linguistics at the Univer-
sity of Vienna. He has worked extensively on the theory of phonology and
morphology, and has worked on Koromfe for sixteen years.

Editorial statement
Until quite recently, work on theoretical linguistics and work on language
description proceeded almost entirely in isolation from one another. Work on
theoretical linguistics, especially in syntax, concentrated primarily on
English, and its results were felt to be inapplicable to those interested in
describing other languages. Work on describing individual languages was
almost deliberately isolationist, with the development of a different frame-
work and terminology for each language
                                  lang~age or language group, and no feeding
of the achievements of language description into linguistic theory. Within the
last few years, however, a major rapprochement has taken place between
theoretical and descriptive linguistics. In particular, the rise of language
typology and the study of language universals have produced a large number
of theoreticians who require accurate, well-formulated descriptive data from
a wide range of languages, and have shown descriptive linguists that they can
both derive benefit from and contribute to the development of linguistic
theory. Even within generative syntax, long the bastion of linguistic anglo-
centrism, there is an increased interest in the relation between syntactic
theory and a wide range of language types.
   For a really fruitful interaction between theoretical and descriptive lin-
guistics, it is essential that descriptions of different languages should be
comparable. The Questionnaire of the present series (originally published as
Lingua, vol. 42 (1977), no. 1) provides a framework for the description of a
language that is (a) sufficiently comprehensive to cover the major structures
of any language that are likely to be of theoretical interest; (b) sufficiently
explicit to make cross-language comparisons a feasible undertaking (in
particular, through the detailed numbering key); and (c) sufficiently flexible
to encompass the range of variety that is found in human language. The
volumes that were published in the predecessor to the present series, the
Lingua Descriptive Studies (now available from Routledge), succeeded in
bridging the gap between theory and description: authors include both
theoreticians who are also interested in description and field workers with an
interest in theory.
Editorial statement  The aim of the Descriptive Grammars is thus to provide descriptions of a
wide range of languages according to the format set out in the Questionnaire.
Each language will be covered in a single volume. The first priority of the
series is grammars of languages for which detailed descriptions are not at
present available. However, the series will also encompass descriptions of
better-known languages with the series framework providing more detailed
descriptions of such languages than are currently available (as with the
monographs on West Greenlandic and Kannada).

"2.1.8.3 The relative order of clitics
There is only one case in which clitics regularly occur adjacent to one
another: in sentences with a direct and indirect object. Both types of object
can be expressed by a suffixal clitic pronoun. In this case, as described and
exemplified in § 1.2.1.2.3 above, the indirect object clitic precedes the
direct object clitic. However, if either of the objects is a full NP, then the
clitic object comes first. Thus the precedence rules for postverbal objects
are:
     1. Clitic pronouns before full NPs, then
     2. Indirect objects before direct objects, provided that 1. is not vio-
        lated.",[351]
"
2.1.2.3.4 Case in reciprocal pronouns
There is no case in Koromfe. Therefore §2.1.2.3 .4.1-2 are inapplicable.
§2.1.2.3.5 is answered in §2.1.2.3.1 above and is therefore omitted. There
are no other ways of expressing reciprocality, therefore §2.1.2.3.6 is inap-
plicable.",[288]

     Clearly, it is not always possible to tell whether what looks like an unanalysable
     morphemic chunk really is one; and if it is (synchronically), whether it was one in
     the near past. The data given here are what appear to be the clear cases.
30
     The 'morphs' given here are not what I assume to be the lexical form of each
     morpheme; only the position of the morpheme boundaries are relevant to the de-
     scription of the diphthongs. The morpheme boundaries shown here are 'maximal',
     i.e. at every position where such a boundary might possibly be considered to exist.
31
     Since there exist no apparent cognates of this word, its morphological analysis
     remains uncertain, though clearly the word must be complex if it is so long.
32
     The word [wolle], PL. [wala] may combine the essence of both of these types of
     phonetic variant; the [0] of the singular could be derived from I AI by both routes,
     although in both cases the word is still irregular.
33
     The term 'syllabic' for consonants, although widely used, is something of a mis-
     nomer, since the consonants involved are not always the whole syllable, but only
     its nucleus. Therefore 'nuclear' consonants would be a better name. Having said
     that, it turns out that all the nuclear consonants of Koromfe are indeed whole sylla-
     bles; they have no (other) onset consonant or rimal consonant.
34
     I am well aware that [""0/] and Ii] are equivalent to the vowels [5] and [i] respec-
     tively, but prefer this more complex transcription to preserve the parallel with the
     other syllabic nasals.
35
     Unfortunately there exist no morphemes with the phonetic shape [ng] or [lJg] which
     could also be contrasted here.
36
     Perhaps 'phrase-final' is a slightly misleading term, since any Koromfe word can
     have its phrase-final realization in the middle of a sentence if it is followed by a
     pause (e.g. in hesitations). The 'phrase' need not consist of more than one word; all
     Koromfe word lists have the phrase-final realization of the word-final segments.
37
     Clearly, the nasal variants [w] and [j] of Iwl and Ij/ respectively do not occur word-
     finally because there is never a following word-initial nasal vowel that could na-
     salize them.
38
     Here I ignore one non-native-Iooking adverb [faahan] 'up to now' and the con-
     junction and non-specific relative k5N - neither of which occur phrase-finally.
39
     Since the syllabic vs. non-syllabic realizations of the 'syllabic nasals' are com-
     pletely automatic, the syllabicity of phrase-initial nasals is not marked in the tran-
     scriptions in the rest of this grammar.
40
     Since these consonant sequences are based only on the derived words contained in
     my database, it is more than likely that a considerably larger number of sequences
     actually occur.
41
     The pseudo-underlying forms given here do not take syllable structure into ac-
     count, and are given only for expository purposes.
42
     Schwa is included here for completeness' sake, even though it is not a full vowel.
     The word-initial sequence [mg] occurs only as a realization of the 1st person sin-
     gular personal pronoun.
43
     A single case of the word-initial sequence [no] exists with unlowered [0], namely
      [nOIJ90], PL. [nom!] 'millstone'; but in the related verb [n5mam] 'pound' the ex-
     pected post-nasal lowering and nasalization processes have taken place. Cf. also
      §3.4 .l.1.1.1 on this word and these processes.","[497, 498]"

2.3.1 Compound nouns
Before considering the different categorial types of compound nouns, it is
important first to examine the morphological and syntactic properties of
the two structures which are available in Koromfe. The examples given
here are uniformly compounds with a genitival meaning involving two
nouns, but the structural properties described here are valid for all types of
compound NP.
    First, let us consider the simpler case of the N+N compound noun.
This structure occupies the position in the NP which is otherwise occupied
by a single N (cf. §1.2.5.5 on the structure of the NP in Koromfe). The
resulting syntactic/morphological structure is given in (749). No daughter
noun of the N+N compound can branch further.
(749)   The (maximal) structure of an NP containing an N+ N compound. (The notation
        IV stands for a bare noun stem without a class suffix.)

ticle or possessive adjective of the higher NP. This structural analysis has
several repercussions, all of which are borne out by the descriptive facts:
     a) The N node cannot have any other prenominal modifier (e.g. the
         article a or possessive adjective).
     b) The embedded NP can have a normal prenominal modifier (article,
         possessive adjective or even a further embedded NP).","[377, 378]"
"1.2.5.2.7 Adverbials
A noun phrase can be modified by one of the short adverbs m5 'also', b
'in any case', Ie 'only' or S:JI 'only'. The latter two adverbs, both meaning
'only' can be repeated for emphasis, e.g. a n51Ja S:JI S:JI 'only fat (and
nothing else)'. 35 These adverbs can also be used to modify pronouns
(usually disjunctive, but optionally clitic), e.g. gu m5 kIret a b5na j§u 'it
also changes into a female goat', where gu m5 consists of a clitic pronoun
followed by the adverb m5 'also'.
    In addition, rarely and probably only in conjunction with action nouns,
a postpositional phrase can modify an NP, as shown in (232).",[119]

"2.2.1.4 Nouns from adverbs
There are no cases that I know of where a noun is derived from an adverb
to be used syntactically as a noun. The alternative word jere1Jfl 'here' for
jere 'here' looks as if it may have a diminutive -ga suffix, but its usage is
exactly the same as the source word, i.e. purely adverbial.",[368]
"2.1.2.2 Reflexive pronouns
2.1.2.2.1 Reflexive pronoun vs. common noun
For the marking of reflexives the word gille 'self' is used following either
a proclitic or a free pronoun. This word looks for all the world like a sin-
gular noun of the dda noun class; but it has no plural. However, since
sentences such as (586) exist, where glUe has no proclitic pronoun but an
article a, this word must be a common noun. In any case, there is no re-
flexive pronoun like French se or German sich.

The absence of any marking is the general case, barring the optional pro-

"1.2.5.5 The order o/the head and its modifiers
Only the article a or a possessive adjective, if present, can (and must)
precede the head noun of an NP. Otherwise, the head noun comes first,
followed by all other modifiers in the order described below. This section
refers to simplex NPs only, and not to the 'set-subset' or topicalized
structures mentioned above.
    The universal quantifier duru 'all, every' must always be the last in the
sequence of modifiers of its head noun, even including a relative clause.
The relative order of modifiers which follow the head noun is therefore
that given in (236) and exemplified by the monster NP given in (237),37

Syntax1.3 Coordination
Coordination in Koromfe is highly restricted. But-coordination is identical
with and-coordination. Only clauses and NPs can be and-coordinated, and
only clauses can be or-coordinated; modifiers of nouns are juxtaposed,
following the noun which they modify. Other minor types of coordination
occur as described below.
     In place of overt clause coordination or constituent coordination, it is
quite usual in Koromfe to find juxtaposed clauses which repeat all con-
stituents of the first clause except for that element which is to be coordi-
nated (provided that the clause is not too long), often with pronoun re-
placements for NP's. While such repetitious structures can also be found
in most languages, in Koromfe they are the normal case. A particularly
striking example is given in (239) (taken from a religious ceremony).

         'They give health during the day, they give health at midnight, they give health

throughout the following sub-sections.","[121, 122, 123]"

Neither of the normal words for 'bend' corresponds to Manessy's root

                             Notes to Chapter 5
4     Abbreviations used in formulae in the kinship terminology tables (alphabetically):      term    meaning      term     meaning      Br      brother      Si       sister
      Ch      child        So       son
      Da      daughter     Wi       wife
      Fa      father          -     younger than (e.g. Ego- 'younger than ego')
      Hu                      +     older than (e.g. Ego + 'older than ego')
              daughter
      Mo      mother          =1=   is not (e.g. =l=Mo 'is not mother of (ego)'
      The complex kinship formulae should be read in the usual way - either from left
      to right with <'S) between, or right to left with 'of' between the individual terms,
      e.g. FaSiSo 'father's sister's son' or 'son of the sister of the father'. Material in pa-
      rentheses at the right of a formula are attributes of the rightmost term, e.g.
      FaSo(Ego +,Ch) 'father's son who is older than ego and still a child'.
4
      The u in parentheses in the plural forms is an optional pre-pausal realization of
      these words.
4
      My informants were unhappy about extending the term bana to include anyone else
      (such as MoBrWiBr or FaWiBr). It seems that MoBr is a very special relative.
4
      Some of these terms also allow pluralization of the first noun, if the result is se-
      mantically/pragmatically plausible.
4
      The bi\lldil part of this compound does not exist elsewhere. My informant Kemde
      was convinced that this is just a contortion of bana, and therefore a semantically
      regular compound equivalent to non-existent *bana bi. Note that if Kemde is right,
      this another case of unexpected assimilation of ATR from right to left like the na-
      salization of r to n described in footnote 6. However, the addition of a d in bi\lldil is
      idiosyncratic.
10
      The variants banTa and banTamma of bara ja and bara jamma 'mother-in-law (of a
      woman)' seem to involve a simple phonological assimilation of the r (/dl) of bara
      to the following nasal approximant j. However, there also exists the word bana
      'maternal uncle', which could be a source of interference, even though it cannot be
      the source of this banTa variant.
10
      There also exists a singular abstract noun nee 'in-law-ness', which can be used
      concretely to denote all blood relatives of the spouse.
10
      It is impossible to say whether the nominal adjectives or the verbs express the
       'basic' form of the morphemes denoting the three basic colours. Note that the
      quality of the (first) stem vowel differs slightly for each noun-verb pair.
9
      This usage probably reflects the fact that the skin of most 'white people' ever seen
      by the Koromba is reddened from the sun.
 10
      Unfortunately I was not in a position to see these plants etc. in the presence of an
      informant, and so the information given on them is nothing more than a report on

     my informants' judgements of colour correspondences with the equivalent French
     terms.
II
     I do not know what nl}re is, but its Koromfe name is do. The word varam is the
     general word for 'flour' of any kind, and is used here only optionally.
12
     The categorization of 'basic' vs. 'further' meanings is purely subjective, based on
     the intuitions of my informants, and is only intended as a general guideline.
13
     This word must be related to bena 'excrement', despite phonological differences in
     nasality and the length of n.
14
     Strictly speaking, 'voice' is not a body part. However, in view of the extended
     meanings 'sound' and 'command', this seems to be the basic meaning than the
     body part 'throat'.
15
     The word kate, PL. kart\. can only be used as the second member of a complex
     (NP+N) NP withjlbre, pL.jlba 'eye' as the first member. Compare also the com-
     pound termjlbre binil} in (908) below.
16
     One informant, Souleymane, also used a singular form knife, with a singulative
     suffix.
17
     The word pogo is the generic word for 'shell', and is widely used in compounds. It
     is only in the compounds (with the words 'hand' and 'foot') that it is used to de-
     note a body part.
18
     The word sebtre, PL. sebta occurs only as the second part of an N+N compound
     noun with w5n, the stem of w5nde, PL. W8nB 'hand' or with wol from wolle, PL.
     wala 'foot' . The meaning 'fist' is slightly puzzling: sebtre must be derived from
     the verb sebtam 'split', and so we would expect the mean 'wrist' here (i.e. the place
      where the hand is 'split' from the arm), parallel to 'ankle' (the place where the foot
      is split from the leg).
19
      My informants report that this irregular singulative form ofw5nde, PL. W8nB 'hand'
      can be used freely instead of w5na bi 'finger'. In spontaneous speech, however,
      they themselves always used w5na bi.
20
      This is the verb from which the noun flllal}t\. 'kind of forked stick' is derived. This
      forked stick is used like a whisk to avoid or get rid of lumps in sauce and thin por-
      ridge. The actual verb for 'whisk' alone (without necessarily cooking) is flredtlm,
      given in this table. The forked stick is held vertically between the palms with the
      forked end in the sauce (etc.) and rolled back and forth to make the forked end ro-
      tate.
21
      The inflectional forms of hortlm are regular (i.e. haru (UNM.), hatu (OUR.), hatM
      (PROG.) except for the PAST, which is harabe instead of expected hare. The form
      hare exists as the past tense of the (also irregular) verb 'lie down': haigu (ACTION
      NOUN), hari (UNM.), hare (PAST), haifu (OUR.), haifM (PROG.).
22
      The initial consonant of the word /cal}, PL. haOrna is totally idiosyncratic and
      irregular - cf. §2.1.1.9.l above.
23
      For some reason no plural of this word is recorded in my corpus; the (probable)
      compound kl zamde 'ugly' has the plural kI zama.
24
      The UNMARKED forms of the verbs given here, i.e. kebsu and n:Jbo, can be used
      participially as post-nominal indeclinable adjectives with the meaning 'big'.
25
      This word means the noun 'cold' (i.e. 'coldness') and cannot be used as a nominal
      adjective.","[560, 561, 562, 563, 564]"
"2.1.1.8. 7 Number marking in foreign words
Foreign words in Koromfe, of which there are a fair number, came from at
least French, English (via other languages first), Arabic and Moore. I am
not in a position to judge whether there are any loans from Ful (Fulani,
Fulfulde, Peul) or other geographically close languages since my knowl-
edge of them is too small; but there are no nouns apart from those dealt
with below which have obviously deviant noun class suffixes (which one
would expect, considering how words from Moore are integrated).",[236]

omitted when it would be expressed in a language like English. In the
fable of the elephant, the hippopotamus and the rabbit the trick used by the
rabbit is to persuade the other two animals that their children will grow to
be bigger if brought up in/outside the water. However, the notion of
growing to be 'bigger than they would otherwise grow' is nowhere overtly
expressed. Instead, the rabbit simply states the 'he will grow', as shown in
(306).

2.1.1.9.2.7 The m singular class
The nouns in this class are uncountable (and therefore have no plural).662.1.1.9.2.8 The fell singulativelcollective class
As its label 'singulative/collective' suggests, this class denotes nouns
which can be viewed as (small) individual members which make up a
mass-like group that is not easily countable. Some typical nouns of this
kind are the insects: 'ant, bee, fly, grasshopper, mosquito', the herd ani-
mals: 'cattle, fish' (though most herd animals are in other noun classes),
the things which grow in almost uncountable masses: 'bushes, creeping
plant, fruits (of various kinds), grass (of various kinds), hair, rice, toma-
toes', and arguably also 'chain',67 'coin', 'pearl', 'star'. Some words have
no collective form because these are either semantically inappropriate (e.g.
'one' and names of languages) or are expressed by other nouns (e.g.
'finger').
    Nevertheless, there remain a few puzzling words: the animals 'parrot,
snake', which are not particularly herd-oriented, the long-thin objects 'rib,
stake' (which might form a semantic sub-group together with the equally
long-thin types of grass, and with 'snake', for which the secret word is
'(blade of) grass'), and the sexual organs 'testicle, vagina' .682.1.1.9.3 Noun class marking on words other than nouns and nominal
adjectives
The noun classes are marked on the noun, are similar to the 3rd person
pronouns, and are also marked on some deictic adjectives and also argua-
bly on numerals. These aspects of the noun class system are dealt with in
their respective sections of this chapter.
    Noun classes are not marked on verbs, although the 3rd person short
pronouns resemble the human, non-human and diminutive class suffixes,
both in subject (=preverbal) and object (=postverbal) position. However,
these morphemes are clearly pronouns rather than noun class agreement
markers, since they do not appear when there is an overt subject or object
noun phrase.","[267, 268]"
"2J 6J 4 The thousands
The word for 'thousand' is tusn, PL. tusa, a loan from Moore. It combines
with the other numerals in the usual way, as can be seen from the examples
in (690), i.e. the largest numeral comes first, and each 'power-of-lO' group
must be followed by La if another numeral (group) follows. And like the
hundreds, the word for 'thousand' can be modified by a numeral from 2 to
9, in which case it must appear in the plural form, tusa.",[337]
"2.1.6.4 The formation of ordinal numerals
Ordinal numerals, apart from the word for 'first', are always formed regu-
larly by the addition of the suffix -ndagu to the last word of the numeral
expression. The final vowel (e.g. of Ii '10') is usually lengthened in the
ordinal numeral, but that of [huru is not; the final vowel of the latter could
be a harmonized 'epenthetic schwa' (cf. §3.2.6.4.2.2), in which case this
behaviour is not surprising.
     In the ordinal numerals the words for '2' up to '9' keep their class pre-
fix [- when used alone, but lose it when used attributively if they immedi-
ately follow the noun, exactly like the cardinal numerals. All the simplex
ordinal numerals (not compounded with La) are given in (703), and some
examples of compound ones in (704). The method of compounding ill
ordinal numerals is exactly the same as in cardinal numerals.

meaning 'first' is impossible.
    When used attributively, the ordinal numerals are located in the usual
postnominal modifier position, as in (705). Ordinal numerals can also
stand alone, or (the more usual case) in a compound genitival NP (of the
type NP+N) with saa 'owner', as shown in (706). In this construction, saa
is used in the same way as English one in phrases like the third one.

"2.1.4 Adjectives
Koromfe has a class of nouns which, roughly speaking, cover a range of
meanings expressed in languages like English by adjectives, and a class of
verbs which cover meanings expressed in English by 'be X', where X is an
adjective. I term these sub-classes of nouns and verbs 'nominal adjectives'
and 'verbal adjectives' respectively, but in fact formally, with the very few
exceptions which I will mention below, nothing distinguishes these
'adjectives' from full verbs or nouns respectively.
    In addition, the UNMARKED form of many verbs can be used participi-
ally as an attributive adjective (with either an active or passive reading).
These participial adjectives cannot be used predicatively (see §2.1.4.3.1.1
below for details).",[320]
"1.2.1.3.1.3 Cases of noun phrases
Koromfe has no cases. However, the universally quantified adverbs tike
duru 'everywhere' and s55ne duru 'always, every time' are plain noun
phrases (comprising the nouns tike 'place + SG.' and s55ne 'time + SG.'
plus the quantifier duru 'all') with no pre- or postposition. Other temporal
adverbials derived from noun phrases, which normally take the preposition
                                                                            71

    The second vowel of the PAST and GERUND forms of these verbs is often extremely
    weak in comparison with all the other forms; in faster speech it seems to be com-
    pletely missing. In Rennison (1993) I offer a phonological analysis for this behav-
    iour.
96
    I have the impression that my informants sometimes added a phonetic [e] or [E] for
    my benefit which would otherwise not have been there. In my recordings of spon-
    taneous speech they are consistently dropped.
97
    If this VI is indeed a suffix, its meaning or function is no longer apparent.
98
    Phonologically, the UNMARKED and DURATIVE verb forms acquire a final, fully
    harmonized 'epenthetic' vowel in phrase-final position (cf. §3.2.6.4.2.2 below).
    The quality of this vowel is shown in parentheses.
99
    In this phonological context, the suffix -d is assimilated to -I. Cf. §3.4.1.1.2.3
    below on this phonological process.
100 This verb is used for the notion of (more) intrinsic surpassing - cf. also § 1.8.1.4    above on its use in comparison (in place of comparative and superlative); the verb
    kEs- on the other hand means 'surpass' in a non-intrinsic reading, and hence has all
    four inflectional verb forms.
101 This and the next pronoun n is a special anaphoric usage of the 2nd singular for a    repeated 3rd person subject. Cf. § 1.5 .2.2.
102 The word kur:J, PL. kuraba is an agent noun derived from the verb ku- 'kill'; the full    or unambiguous expression for 'butcher' is nt'mm5 kur:J 'meat killer'. However,
    kur:J alone normally suffices, and I find it refreshing that the default objects of
    'killer' in Koromfe are not human beings but domestic animals.
103 When the subject is emphasized with the postposed emphatic particle la, which is    homophonous with the copula, this sentence would read a b:Jr:J hOl] la waragl,
    which looks very much like a 'copula + participle' structure. However, I am sure
    that no such structure is involved, otherwise we would not expect to find all other 3
    finite verb forms in the position of waragl (since only the UNMARKED form can
    ever be a participle); but we do find the 3 emphatic sentences: a b:Jr:J hOl] la
      {waragt' (PAST) / waragn (DUR.) / waragraa (PROG.)}.
104  The words d:Jl and d:Jlmee both mean length and can be used interchangeably; I
     have found no context in which they contrast in any way.
lOS
     This holds even bearing in mind that morphologically there is no distinction be-
     tween the 'adjective' d:J:Jrt' and the 'noun' b:Jr:J. For here, it is not 'masculinity'
     that is 'measured', but rather some attribute of a 'man'. Incidentally, b:Jr:J is fre-
     quently used as an adjective meaning 'male' in kinship terminology - cf. §5.1.1

106 There also exists a form kebe meaning 'be large'. It looks as if it ought to be a PAST     form of verb keb- 'grow', but such a verb does not exist; instead we find keb+s-
     'grow', with an -s suffix. Compare also the nominal adjective kebre, PL. kebitt
     'big'.
107 The variation in the length of the final a's is identical to that found in the PRO-     GRESSIVE forms of verbs, and is phonologically automatic. The verbal adjectives
     given here with a short a only are those for which I omitted to elicit a phrase-final
     form (which, I am sure, would have a long aa).
 108 Contrary to cases where a follows u or I across a word boundary, in la ub and la     Ib the sequences a+u and a+l do not fuse phonetically or assimilate noticeably.","[403, 404]"
