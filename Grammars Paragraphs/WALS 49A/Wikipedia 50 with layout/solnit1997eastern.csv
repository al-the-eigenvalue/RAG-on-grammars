                         Chapter 1              Typological Outline       The purpose of this chapter is to provide an overview of
the Kayah Li language before launching into detailed descrip-
tion. In doing so I will make use of both standard typological
parameters,   such   as word-order,   and   of more   traditional cate-
gories such as ‘tonal’, hoping to situate the language           in the
Southeast Asian areal context as well as among human languages
in general. A more practical consideration is to familiarize the
reader with basic Kayah Li sentence structure and with a short
list of high-frequency morphemes, which should ease compre-
hension of the upcoming example sentences and expressions. For
example, since virtually every clause contains at least one pro-
noun, I give a list of pronouns here so that the reader does not
need to hunt out the chapter (6) on Nouns and the NP, where the
pronoun system is discussed.
       Note that the use of familiar terms like Noun, Verb, Indi-
rect Object, Prepositional Phrase, and so on, should not be taken
to mean   that the Kayah    Li phenomena       are identical in every
respect to their counterparts of these names in familiar languages
like English. They are similar enough that the familiar terms can

an element (usually a pronoun) present in the AtrC, marking the            stituents in addition to the verb:

position in the AtrC, cf. also (5) above. If the head relates to an
Object, there usually is no pronoun in that position, as in (6, 7, 9).     But these Locative embedded clauses differ from the usual AtrC
                                                                           in that they never include Subject NP’s. Note also that the post-8.1.3                                                                      verbal NP’s in the above examples are Locative in meaning

       A distinct subtype of nominalized clause that should be             Direct Objects rather than PP’s in function. In an autonomousmentioned occurs in Locative expressions. Most simply, and                 clause the Locative expression would be a PP; e.g. ‘go down
                                                                                                                                        to
quite commonly, these are of the form [pp d¥ V (na)], where V is           Thoka’s house’ would be le d¥ Th6ké hi. If that autonomous

0.1     Kayah, Karen, Karenni0.1.1    General Remarks
       The language described in this study is an Eastern dialect
of Kayah Li. Kayah in turn is a Central Karen language, and
Karen is a major subdivision of the Tibeto-Burman branch of
Sino-Tibetan. Kayah Li is thus very closely related to languages
like Bwe and Bré; less closely to other Karen languages like
Sgaw, Pho and Pa-O (Taungthu); more distantly to hundreds of
languages    including     Burmese,        Tibetan,    Lahu, Yi, Lushai,   etc.;
and most remotely to Chinese.
        Karen is a well-defined subgroup of Tibeto-Burman, with
no questionable members. It covers a relatively continuous block
of territory extending to either side of the Thailand-Burma bor-
der, plus outlying scattered groups of Sgaw in the Irrawady delta.
Sgaw is the largest Karen language in number of speakers, with
Pho probably second largest. Population figures can only be
approximate; one guess for total speakers of Karen languages is
between     3 to 4.5     million,   with     perhaps    300,000   in Thailand.
Speakers of Karen languages certainly make up the largest (non-
urban) minority ethnicity in both Burma and Thailand. Kayah Li

necessitating a repetition of té:

8.1      Non-autonomous Nominalized Clauses                              definition of Prepositions as taking NP objects.
          A nominalized clause is any clause followed by na, or by
a Clf' before which na can be inserted. If the nominalized clause        8.1.2 Preposed Attributive Clauses

Sequential V-V could be:                                                  This still leaves a great many possible combinations, not all of

Glossary and Index
       Kayah Li-English Glossary        This glossary includes all Kayah Li forms cited in the
Grammar and occurring in the Texts, plus selected core vocabu-
lary items. Interjections are omitted.
        Clearly-related items with distinct meanings or grammat-
ical categories are combined in a single entry; for example, khri
‘be shattered’ (V), ‘a fragment’ (N), ‘C:shards’ (Clf).
        Little attempt has been made to indicate the analysis of
polymorphemic items. For example, si?iché ‘afraid’ probably
consists of si ‘heart’ and ché ‘hurt’; but the former component is
suggested only by the word’s alphabetical listing next to other
items beginning with sf, while the latter is not indicated at all,
although ché may be found in its alphabetically determined place.
        The glossary is arranged in ordinary alphabetical order,
subject to the following additional conventions:
          1. Entries are ordered by the phonological initial of the
first full syllable. Ordering by phonological initial rather than by
first letter means that aspirates and complex initials are separated
out from each other; e.g. p ph phr pl. Prefixed forms (those begin-
ning ?f ?i ko to pa) are listed under the initial of the full sylla-
ble; e.g. kajé follows jé and precedes jo.
       2. Zero initial comes first. Glottal stop is between n and p.
       3. Order of rhymis   esa e € i ja jo A090U Wa We Wi UI                                337
