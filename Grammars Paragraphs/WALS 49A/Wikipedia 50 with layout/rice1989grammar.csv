          3.mother  3. In SOV dominant languages, adverbial modifiers tend to precede the
verb. This is the case in Slave.
  4. Determiners usually precede the noun in verb-final languages. They
do in Slave.
  Slave differs from the verb final languages considered by Greenberg in
a number of ways.
   1. In languages with postpositions, question particles are generally
sentence-final. The Slave question particle is sentence-initial.
  2. In verb-final languages, adjectives normally precede the noun.
While Slave does not have real adjectives, adjectival type elements, the
lexical modifiers, follow the noun.
   3. Relative clauses tend to precede the head noun in verb-final lan-
guages while in Slave they follow the head noun.",[1048]
"10. The definition of 'theme' can perhaps be extended to include the ob-
    ject of a postposition and the possessor of a noun. Then the gender
    pronoun occurs on the category for which the noun fills the thematic
    role of theme.

                               Unspecified Subjects
  There are two ways of leaving an agent unspecified in Slave. These are
(1) use of the classifier passive and (2) use of the unspecified subject ts'e-.
In both cases, reference to the subject or agent is avoided.","[1074, 1075]"

24.17.2         The         classificatory     verbs   All the Athapaskan languages exhibit an alternation of verb themes that
is traditionally called classificatory. The classificatory themes describe the
nature of an object handled with respect to parameters such as extension
and dimension.      They restrict an action to certain classes of subject or
object.    The Athapaskan verb system has been discussed widely (for
example, Davidson, Elford, and Hoijer 1963, Garrison 1974, Carter 1976,
Witherspoon 1977).
   The verb theme indicates the nature of the object handled while the
type of activity involved is expressed in the prefixes. In all cases, the
object delimited by the verb theme bears the thematic role relationship of
theme to the verb: it is the subject of an intransitive verb and the o b j e c t
of a transitive verb.
   Davidson, Elford and Hoijer (1963), in a major description of the class-
ificatory verb system, differentiate four sets of classificatory verbs, as in
(2).",[823]
"26.1.6     Some sample lexical entries   Each verb theme includes information as to category, phonological form,
and semantics amongst other information. Verb themes must be marked
for theme category, for subcategorization features, and for thematic roles
of their arguments. Since all verbs require a subject, this subcategoriza-
tion need not be lexically marked, although the thematic role of the sub-
ject must be indicated. Verb themes can be subcategorized for a direct or
an oblique object and this information must be lexically indicated.
   Simplified lexical entries are given in (140) through (145). These in-
clude (1) a representation of the theme, (2) the lexical category, (3) the

30.6        Summary   Possible coreference relations are determined in Slave by a rule of non-
coreference, based on the notions of precedence and command, that desig-
nates when two noun phrases cannot refer to the same entity.       Apparent
anomalous sentences are accounted for by this rule if some postpositions
also occur in the category conjunction.
   This chapter deals with one facet of coreference: that of assigning
possible coreference relations between nouns and pronouns. With the ex-
ception of anaphors, there are no cases in which nouns and pronouns must
be coreferential, while there are cases where they must be noncoreferen-
tial.   Other cases of coreference, anaphors (reflexive, reciprocal,    ye-),
where there must be an antecedent within the sentence, are discussed in
chapter 28. Cases where the interpretation of the subject of a complement
is controlled by the subject or object of the higher verb are discussed in
chapter 42.",[1091]
"26.4.1    Coreference interpretation  One function of logical form is to determine coreference relations within
a sentence. In order to do this, it is useful to distinguish three different
types of nouns: anaphors, pronouns, and lexical nouns.
  An anaphor is a noun that has no independent reference but which
takes its reference from its antecedent.   In Slave, the anaphors are the
reflexive pronoun, the reciprocal pronoun, and the fourth person ye-. If
an anaphor is used in a sentence where it has no antecedent, the sentence
is uninterpretable.
  The pronouns are the morphemes traditionally considered to be pro-
nouns (except for those that are anaphors).    They are free in reference
within the sentence in which they occur.
  The lexical nouns are always free in reference within the sentence in
which they occur.
  The anaphors are illustrated in (155) through (157).(155)    reflexive

        c. t'eere yekwighä jts'i           'the girl combed his hair' (Bl)The anaphors have no independent reference but take their r e f e r e n c e
from some other expression in the sentence. The reflexive and reciprocal
are coreferential to their antecedent and ye- must be noncoreferential t o
its antecedent.
   Reflexives, reciprocals, and ye- can be direct objects, oblique objecst, or
possessors of direct and oblique objects. 2 8 They can never be subjects or
occur in subject position. The word formation rules that form verbs never
place these pronouns in subject position. They could, however, potentially
become subjects by the passsive word formation rule, a rule that makes
an object into a subject. The effect of this rule is illustrated in (158).(158)   a. r ä s e r e y i h t ' u       's/he hit me' (Hr)
        b. r ä r e y e h t ' u           Ί got hit'
        c. r a ? e d e r e y e h t ' u   Ί hit myself
        d. * r a ? e d e r a t ' u       'myself got hit' (grammatical reading:    s/he
                                         hit h i m / h e r s e l f )(158b) is the passive form of (158a), with the direct object in ( 1 5 8 a ) be-
ing the subject of (158b).  (158c) is the reflexive counterpart to (158a).
(158d) shows that it is not possible to make the reflexive pronoun into a
subject. The same is true for the reciprocal (159) and the pronoun ye-.(159)   a. n a ' e i e k e n a t ' u     'they hit each other'
        b. * n a ? e l e n a t ' u       'each other got hit'Conditions on the reciprocal are more complex than those on the reflexive.
While the reflexive pronoun can occur as an object no matter what the
subject is, 2 9 the reciprocal pronoun is possible only when the subject is
overtly plural or can be interpreted as plural.    This can be handled by
marking the reciprocal pronoun with the feature [+plural].      If the noun
which should serve as its antecedent is not interpretable as plural, then
there is a feature mismatch and the sentence will be rejected.
                                                                          The Model   985   It is necessary to filter out passives with reflexive and reciprocal sub-
jects. It is also necessary to eliminate sentences with reflexive, reciprocal,
and ye- possessive pronouns in subject position, as in (160).(160)   a. *dem9 yeghäyeyjdä                    'his/her   mother saw      him/her'
        b. * ? e t e m 9 naxets'f g o y j d e   'each other's mother talked to us'
        c. *yem9 yeghäyeyidä                    'his/her   mother   saw    him/her'These sentences are ungrammatical.        They can be rejected from the
grammar by stating that anaphors must be bound within the sentence, or,
in other words, anaphors must have an antecedent within the simplex
sentence in which they occur.      The anaphors cannot be subjects since
subjects have no antecedent within the sentence.
  Pronominals are somewhat different f r o m anaphors. 3 0 They do not
have an antecedent within the same sentence. When more than one sen-
tence is involved, coreference is possible between the pronouns within the
two sentences. This is shown in the examples in (161) and (162).         ?
(161)     e y i dene [ b e g h ä y e r i s h ü yjle i ] iesasone tä'enjse

         3.dad        3 opt. work  3 want
                'her! dad wants Maryj to work' (SI)Corefence is possible (but not necessary) in (161) and (162), as indicated
by the subscripts, because the pronominals are in different sentences.
   Finally, lexical nouns are free in reference: they are not coreferential to
any other noun phrase within the simplex sentence. Coreference between
nouns is generally not possible even when they are not within the same
simplex sentence. In general, lexical nouns must be free both inside and
outside the simplex sentence.
   Anaphoric relationships within a simplex sentence are accounted for
then with three principles. First, anaphors must be bound in reference in
their sentence.     Second, pronominals must be free in reference in their
sentence. Finally, lexical nouns must be free in reference.
   Coreference relationships between sentences dominated by a higher
sentence node must also be accounted for. These relationships can be ex-
plained by the principle of noncoreference interpretation, discussed in
chapter 30.     This condition defines the circumstances under which two
noun phrases must be noncoreferential.
   It is also necessary to account for coreference relationships in the case
of constituents in topic and question complementizer positions. There are
two different ways that constituents can be placed in these positions:
nouns are base generated and nonnominals are moved by the movement
rule discussed in section 26.3.
986      Part IV. The Model   When a constituent is moved, it leaves behind a trace in its base gener-
ated position. The moved constituent and the trace are coindexed.       The
trace is free in reference in its sentence, like the pronoun.     The con-
stituents in topic position must have a reference somewhere in the sen-
tence so that they can be interpreted: it and the coindexed trace are in-
terpreted as having the same reference because they are coindexed.
   Base generated noun phrases in topic and question complementizer po-
sitions are handled differently. These noun phrases must be linked to a
noun within the sentence to receive a reading. An interpretive rule does
this. Matching of features between the nouns within S and the noun in
topic or question complementizer positions filters out sentences where
there is no noun phrase within the sentence that can be interpreted as
coreferential to the dislocated noun. The dislocated noun is thus linked to
an argument position of the verb and is interpreted as coreferential to
that argument, taking on its grammatical and thematic roles.","[1027, 1028, 1029, 1030]"
"31.3.3       The sentential conjunctions   The lexical category of sentential conjunction is not so clearly defined.
There are some arguments that suggest that some of these are conjunc-
tions while others are postpositions.   Pronominal inflection on the post-
postions/conjunctions in Hare suggests that some are conjunctions. Word
order also suggests this. Evidence from coreference phenomena also pro-
                                                              Conjunction     1075vides some evidence that some are conjunctions. See chapter 30 for dis-
cussion. Of these forms, -tl'$ah£ 'after,' -were 'before,' -t'äh 'because,' -he
'because,' -ghäri 'by means of,' and -k'i 'after' function as conjunctions as
well as postpositions, -ts'fh 'from,' -ts'p 'to,' and -t'gh 'since,' on the other
hand, pattern as postpositions only.
   In Hare, the postposition/conjunctions           -were, -hi, -ghdri, and -k'i
can be preceded by yi. This form yi is an anaphoric pronoun, related to
the complementizer that marks relative clauses.          It occurs in sentences
such as those in (196) through (199). 9(196) Carol     fere raxets'f räyjdi     h a y i t l ' j Theresa raxets'f ray j d i

        3 drinks 3pl. told lsg. by means of lsg. know
              Ί know that he drinks because they told me' (Hr)These sentences all contain the morpheme yi. This form occurs with lim-
ited distribution. It occurs as a complementizer in the form yi or /. It oc-
curs with the pronoun ha- in the form hayi, which can follow lexical
nouns. It also occurs before the complementizers gha and ch'ä. What is
important here is that there are some postpositions that appear to func-
tion as complementizers.       There are a number of arguments that show
that the morphemes gha and ch'ä function differently from the other
postpositions and that these two are best viewed as complementizers.
One way in which these postpositions that can also be complementizers
differ from those that are only postpositions is that only the complemen-
tizers can be preceded by (ha)yi.       This anaphoric form does not appear to
be used with postpositions, only with complementizers.
   If the postposition/conjunctions in sentences such as (196) through
(199) are conjunctions, then the anaphoric form yi can never occur with
postpositions, but only with conjunctions and complementizers.         If they
are postpositions, it is unexplained why yi fails to occur in many cases
where it would be expected. For instance, it cannot occur with the postpo-
sitions -ts'fh 'from' and -ts'§ 'to,' as shown in (200) and (201).

  The second argument that suggests that there are conjunctions comes
from word order.    Postpositional phrases generally follow the subject, as
in the examples in (202) through (204).","[1118, 1119, 1120]"

NP immediately dominated by S and is thus the subject. 'Mary' is the sec-
ond NP immediately dominated by S and is the direct object. Within the
lower sentence, the pronoun is a subject.
   These definitions also apply in sentences with nouns in topic and ques-
tion complementizer position. In these cases, the dislocated noun is not
dominated by S, but by S' or S"". Therefore it does not get assigned a
grammatical relation directly.    Instead, it is interpreted as having the
grammatical relation of the noun to which it is linked by the rules dis-
cussed in section 26.4.1. (165) has a noun in topic position.         ?

'Boy' is linked to the pronoun and gets interpreted as direct object.
  Grammatical relations are assigned on the basis of full phrase markers
as projected from the lexicon.","[1030, 1031]"

47.8        Summary  Relative clauses in Slave occur in two different structures, either inter-
1328    Part V. Syntaxnally or externally headed.   Rules of interpretation ensure that the two
structures receive the same range of readings. 1 5
Notes1. Relative clauses and complements occur in the same structure.     The
   fact that sentences can be ambiguous between relative clause and
   complement readings follows from this: there are two rules of seman-
   tic interpretation that operate on the same syntactic structure. Some
   examples of such ambiguous sentences are given in (i) and (ii).   i. ?9de       nägwe        keodihshg    ile
      where       3sg. lives 3 knows area NBG
              relative clause: Ί don't know the place where he lives' (Hr)
              complement: Ί don't know where he lives'   ii. j u d e n j jiye     ηεζρ     i     g?hlj   nj     kodihshg
       w h e r e b e r r y 3 is good COMP area is COMP lsg. know area
                relative clause: Ί know the place where good berries are' (Hr)
                complement: Ί know where good berries are'   However, few sentences are actually ambiguous between the readings.
   The pronouns on the matrix verb make the interpretations clear.        For
   example, in (iii) and (iv), (iii) must be interpreted as a relative clause
   and (iv) as a complement because of the pronouns.   iii. Bernice ?amii ts'f godee    hodihshg  ile
                who to      3 talk  lsg. know NBG
                   Ί don't know the one who Bernice is talking to (Bl)   iv. Bernice ?amii ts'f godee kodihshp      ile
                                lsg. know area
                   Ί don't know who Bernice was talking to'   In (iii), there is no pronominal oblique object on the matrix verb so
   some preceding noun must fill this role. In (iv), on the other hand, the
   presence of the pronoun ke- means that what precedes it is interpret-
   ed areally or sententially. It is thus only in cases like (i), where the
   head noun is areal and therefore occurs with the areal agreement
   marker go-Ike-     on the matrix verb, that the potential for ambiguity
   arises.
   In Hare, where complementizers are common, they also serve to limit
   interpretations.   The complementizer i requires a relative clause inter-
   pretation while nj. requires a complement or areal relative clause in-
   terpretation.

   stricting sentence. Such a structure is marked for SOV languages
   where prenominal relative clauses are expected.","[1371, 1372, 1373]"

Tenenbaum (1978) notes that in Tanaina the prefix ne- 'refers to birds
and nowadays to airplanes' (page 151).       It appears that in Hare this
prefix is maintained in all verb themes referring to flying. The prefix
ne- is lost in the other dialects in these two verb themes although it is
maintained in ne + 0 = t'a 'fly.'

                            (verb prefix position      7)
   There are two deictic pronouns that can occur in third person forms;
ts'e- unspecified human subject and ke- (Hr, B1 )/ge- (Bl, SI, Mt) human
plural subject. These pronouns are discussed in more detail in chapter 28.
24.6.1     ke-lge-      human   plural  This prefix marks human plural number in the third person.       It
indicates number and gender, but not person, which is indicated by a
position 12 prefix. Several examples are given in (1) through (4).(1) k e ? ä                       'they are eating' (Hr, Bl)(2) kajj                          'they sang' (Bl)(3) genjdhe                       'they want' (SI)(4) kenezo                        'they (human) are good' (Hr, Bl)  (1) through (4) illustrate the use of ke-lge-.   (5) and (6) show the
human/nonhuman contrast.    In the (a) forms, ke-lge- is not present and
the verb can be interpreted as having a nonhuman subject. In the (b)
forms, where ke-lge- is present, the subject must be human.(5) a.        rirenjdee           'they (e.g. birds) landed' (Hr)
    b.        rikerenidee         'they (human) landed' (Hr)(6) a.        jtse                'it, they (nonhuman) cried' (SI)
    b.        gijtse              'they (human) cried' (SI)  The pronoun ke-lge- is used to indicate collective rather than i n d i v i d u a l
action. This can be seen by comparing (7) and (8). In (7), ke-lge- is not
present while in (8) it is. In (8), a group must be involved.(7) kigho godee                   'they are talking about him/her' (Hr)
624          Part III.     Categories(8) kigho gokedee                            'they are plotting, talking as a group about
                                             him/her' (Hr)
24.6.2         ts'e-       unspecified  The pronoun ts'e-   indicates an unspecified human subject.     It is
unmarked for number and can be used as singular or plural unspecified.
Examples of its use as an unspecified singular are given in (9) through
(11).(9) ts'e # ye + d = chu                      'wake sg. object'
    1       8   13        ts'esets'eyeshu                      'someone woke me up' (Hr)(10) ' e t s ' e d e h s h ü                 'someone is whistling'(11) k ' i n a t s ' e d a      'someone is walking around' (Hr, Bl)
The fact that ts'e- can be a singular unspecified subject is most clear in
(11) where the verb theme 0 = da requires a singular subject.
  ts'e- is also an unspecified plural, as illustrated in (12) through (14).(12) s h e t s ' u y e e                           'let's eat'         ?

   In Bearlake, ts'e- indicates first person plural, while id- is restricted to
first person dual. Examples in (15) and (16) show the distinction.(15) shewiiti                                'let's (two) eat' (Bl)
     shets'uyee                              'let's (pi.) eat'(16) hiji                                    'we two sing' (Bl)
         ts'eji                              'we pi. sing'In the other dialects, id- indicates both dual and plural definite number
and ts'e- is unspecified.
  ts'e- can occur with a subject noun phrase, as shown (17).(17) dene                jo      näts'ede     'we people live here' (Bl)
     people              here    unspec. live

generally rendered by a simple third person subject, as in (18).(18) dene       jo     näde       'people live here' (Bl)
     people     here   3 live  ts'e- is used in forming nominals.   See chapter 12 for details.      Some

628      Part III.       Categories24.7.5     ye-       fourth     person  The fourth person pronoun ye- is used when there is a third person
subject. It occurs when no nominal object of the verb is specified. In the
examples in (5) through (8), the first example of each pair shows a verb
with the object pronoun ye- and the second shows a verb with a nominal
object, and therefore no direct object pronoun in the verb.(5) y e h t s j                          's/he is making it' (Bl, SI)

    child  ye- is also used when the nominal direct object is in topic position and
thus does not directly precede the verb.   See chapter 41 for discussion.
An example is given in (9). The first example shows the direct object
immediately preceding the verb and no object pronoun in the verb. The
second example shows the direct object in topic position and the direct
object pronoun ye- in the verb.                ?

singular or plural. Examples are given in (10) and (11).(10) n a y e n e h ? i                   's/he is hiding him/her' (Bl, SI)

24.7.6        e-     unspecified  The direct object pronoun ? e - marks an object that is unspecified. In
the examples in (12) through (14), a form with the unspecified object
pronoun is contrasted with a form with a specified object.(12)     ?eh?ä                        Ί am eating (something)' (Hr, Bl)

         parka  The unspecified pronoun 7e- occurs in many verb bases in direct object
position where it indicates an object that need not be specified because its
referent is culturally understood.   For instance, in the verb in (15), the
reference of ?e- to clothing is understood so need not be stated.(15) bebi k a r a ? e w i w a         Ί undressed the baby; literally: I took
     baby                             unspecified Ο off the baby' (Hr)In this verb, the direct object is ? e - and bebi is an oblique object. The
sentence shown in (16), where the direct object is indicated by a noun, is
also possible.(16) bebi yii        karäwiwa         Ί undressed the baby; literally: I took
     b a b y clothes                  clothes off the baby' (Hr)   Some other examples of the pronoun        unspecified used to refer to a
referent understood from the culture are given in (17) through (20).(17)     yek'e'ede'o                  's/he ironed it; literally: s/he handled three
                                      dimensional Ο     ( ? e-) on it (ye-)'

object is required, it is the object of an incorporated postposition, as in
examples (15), (17), (18), and (19). If the second object is optional, it is
the object of an unincorporated postposition, as in (20). See unit 14 for
discussion of incorporated and inincorporated postpositions.
   ?e- is thematic in some cases. The verbs where it is thematic may have
originally been transitive, requiring a direct object. Now ?e- is part of the
verb theme and the theme is intransitive, never taking any other direct
object, either pronominal or nominal. Examples are given in (21) and (22).(21)    ?e + 0 = dlo                     'laugh'

           ?
        te enjhka                        's/he jumped into water'  A few verb bases have an unspecified object pronoun in direct object
position and a specified direct object noun outside the verb. Examples are
given in (23) and (24).                 ?

     beaver hide 2sg. cutThe noun in these sentences is not marked as an oblique object and if no
noun is present, no oblique object pronoun appears.      These verbs appear
to have two direct objects. This is unusual since in general, if an object
pronoun is present, there is no nominal object outside the verb. In other
words, a verb has a single direct object, either a noun or a pronoun.

        na*a ? edehndih gha               Ί will pour it out anytime, later'This pronoun         appears to be 7e- unspecified. In the first example in
(25), the referent is clearly visible and therefore need not be specified. In
the second example, the removal in time makes the reference unspecified.
  The unspecified object is sometimes avoided in past reference. In (26),
the verb has an oblique object.

         ? ?eghälyeyidä                   Ί worked'While the unspecified oblique object is preferred in the imperfective if no
definite object is named, the definite pronoun be- is definitely preferred
in the perfective mode, as the second two examples in (26) show. The
definite pronoun can be used in the imperfective mode if there is definite
reference, as in the dialogue in (27). Here the definite be- can be used
because its referent, radio, has just been established.(27) su radio ' a r a n e t ' e           'did you sg. finish (working on) the radio?'

with the direct object 7e-. Examples are given in (28). The first line of
each example shows an active with the direct object        and the second
line shows the corresponding passive with the subject(28) a. b e k ' e 7 e d e ? o             Ί ironed it; literally:       I handled three

    sent state of the art in the study of this group of
m   Native American languages spoken in a large part of

m   American Southwest (including such languages as
    Navajo, Apache, and Hupa]. These languages are
m   characterized by a particularly complex verb mor-

    The lengthy introduction by the editors gives a
m   general overview of areas that have been important
    in the field of Athapaskan studies in the past 25
m   years, and provides the reader with the context in
    which the following contributions can be seen. The
m   papers themselves deal with diachronic linguistics,
    phonology and morphology, syntax, discourse and
m   ethnolinguistics, and have been prepared by lea-
    ding scholars in the field.

           'now they use only traps when they hunt beaver and
           muskrat' (Bl)  The second fact that shows that there is a conjunction hi as well as a
postposition -hi comes from agreement phenomena.         When there is a
subject with two conjuncts conjoined by hi, the verb can be inflected for a
plural subject. The same holds true if the conjoined nouns are a direct or
oblique object: inflectional pronouns on the verb or postposition must be
1074     Part V.    Syntaxplural. This can be seen in several examples given above: (145), (149),
and (152) through (159) with hi and (160) through (166) with hg. If one
of the conjuncts is first person, the inflectional pronoun must be first per-
son plural; if one of the conjuncts is second person and the other third
person, the inflectional pronoun is second person plural; and if both con-
juncts are third person, the inflectional pronoun is third person plural.
   When the conjunction hi conjoins noun phrases, a plural inflectional
pronoun appears on the verb or postposition. This is not the case with the
postposition -hi.   As (190) shows, the subject of the verb is singular when
-hi is a postposition. Sentence (190) has the structure shown in (193).","[1117, 1118]"
"  The lexicon thus contains themes, the minimal lexical specification of a
word, and affixes.    The nature of the themes and their relationship to
words is discussed below.
  In many cases, there does not appear to be any difference between a
noun root and a noun theme.      Since nouns often are not prefixed, the
theme will not include any more lexical material than the root.
  Noun words are often identical to noun themes (and thus to noun roots).
The noun word can be formed from the theme by zero derivation.         The
derived form is the noun stem. Some examples are shown in (3).(3) t u                            'water'
    sah                            'bear'
    ko                             'fire'
    -kwi                           'head' (Bl)In these words, there is no difference between the theme and the word,
suggesting that the noun formative is a null affix, a suffix since category
determining affixes in Slave are suffixes.
  Noun words are not necessarily identical to themes. Some nouns (noun
stems) differ from the theme by the presence of a final I I I in the word.
This consonant is historically a noun stem formative that derives instru-
mental nouns from themes. Examples are given in (4).(4) a. xeeh, -gheele               'pack, load, freight' (noun)
       cf. 0-xee                   'pack' (verb theme)
    b. tl'uh, -tl'ule              'rope' (noun)
       cf. 0-tl'u                  'tie' (verb theme)The nouns in (4) differ from the themes, shown in verb themes, by the fi-
nal consonant present in the noun.       This consonant derives historically
from the Athapaskan instrumental suffix * - t . The suffix is not used pro-
ductively in Slave but is lexicalized with some nouns.
  There are some nouns that include an obligatory suffix. This suffix has
the form -e, as in (5). It too is a stem formative.(5) a. t ' e e r e                 'girl' (Hr, Bl)
    b. i u e                       'fish' (Bl, SI)
    c. b e l e                     'wolf (Hr)  These three types constitute the basic set of nouns. Nouns are derived
from noun themes by suffixation of 0 , -/, or -e.
  Noun and verb themes often share a root, as shown in (6).(6) a. te             'ice'      0-te        'freeze'
    b. shi            'song'     d-shj       'sing'

     g- - d e l -    'blood'          0-dele           'be red'The question of whether nouns and verbs share not just a root but also a
theme can be posed. At a word level, more lexical material is required in
the verb than in the noun. While a noun word can consist of a stem alone
(root plus stem-forming suffix), a verb word must contain not only a root
and a stem-forming suffix but also a classifier and any thematic prefixes
(and inflection for person, number, mode). While at the word level verbs
and nouns which share a root differ, is this true at the theme level?
  There is some evidence that nouns and verbs not only share roots, but
share themes. There are some nouns in Slave that occur with a prefix in
some dialects and that are related to verbs. When the related verb theme
has an h- classifier, this morpheme is present in the prefixed noun form.
Some examples are given in (7).(7) a. h - f i h     'action with axe' (Hr)                 gohfih    'axe' (Hr)
         cf. tthih   'axe' (SI)
     b. h - b e      'stretch on round stretcher' ? e h b e 'round stretcher'
     c. h - s e      'hook' (verb)                gohze 'hook at end of stick'
     d. h - d z o    'trap' (verb)                ' e h d z o 'trap' (noun)In (7), the verb themes have the h- classifier. A prefixed noun related to
these verbs also has an h- preceding the stem, possibly the A- classifier.
In prefixed nouns related to verbs with the 0 classifier, this h- does not
appear before the noun stem.(8) a. 0 - k ' a     'file, sharpen' (verb)            gok'a    'file' (noun)
    b. 0 - x o       'kill pi.1                        ""'eghoni 'person in war, killer'
                                                       ?
     c. 0 - l a      'float'                               ela       'boat'Based on these data, it appears that a prefixed noun related to a verb
theme with the h- classifier also has the h- classifer since one related to a
verb with the 0 classifier does not have an h-. If the classifier is present
in the noun theme as well as in the verb theme entry, then the presence
of the classifier in the prefixed noun form can be accounted for. If the
classifier is not present in the noun theme, the presence of [h] in the
prefixed noun is idiosyncratic and unpredictable.         This suggests that
related nouns and verbs share a theme, a lexical entry unmarked for
category, and a function of stem formation rules is to assign category.
  Further evidence that related nouns and verbs share a common theme
can be seen in some compound forms. In (9), the d- classifier occurs on
the second member of the compound.

       cf. shg                            'song'If the d- classifier is part of the basic lexical entry, such a form can easily
be accounted for: when compounding occurs, the classifier is maintained. 2
   It is more difficult to ascertain whether other thematic prefixes are pre-
sent in noun theme entries since it is difficult to know whether a noun
with thematic prefixes is derived directly from a theme or indirectly by
nominalization.      Nouns with thematic prefixes that are candidates for
showing that nouns and verbs share the same theme are shown in (10).(10) a. y a h t j             's/he preaches'       yahtj     'priest, Father'
     b. Ο rehshee             's/he grows O' (Hr)   rehshee    'potato'There is no nominalizer in these nouns and they may be cases of nouns
derived directly from themes rather than nouns derived indirectly by
nominalization of a verb.
   In examples such as (6), the nouns and verbs share a theme consisting
of a classifier and a root. The theme is unlabelled for category in the lexi-
con if it can be a noun or a verb. If it can be only a noun or only a verb, it
is labelled for category.    Since the theme contains a root and thematic
prefixes, stem formation rules must apply to assign the stem level labels
of noun and verb. The rules that assign the label noun are the suffixation
rules discussed above.     The rules that are required to assign the label
verb are those that add stem-forming suffixes to the verb. In addition, a
second word formation rule is required for verbs. Every verb must have
at least one syllable preceding the stem. This syllable is added to verbs
by a word formation rule that inserts a syllable before a verb stem. This
rule is shown in (11).(11)        [syllable [X] v ] vIn nouns, the classifier is generally lost since it does not become part of a
syllable. If, however, a syllable is placed before it, as in (7), the classifier
remains.    The facts that it is generally only verbs that have a phonetic
classifier and that it is only verbs that require a prestem syllable are thus
related: the syllable allows the classifier a phonetic realization.
   Postposition roots, themes and stems are identical since there are not
thematic prefixes present in postpositions and the stem-forming suffix is
null. Some examples are given in (12).(12) -ts'f                                 'to'
           -ts'fh                          'from'

   In these sentences, the first branching node that dominates the pronoun
does not dominate the noun, so coreference is possible.       The noun also
precedes the pronoun in these sentences.        For these sentences then,
precedence alone accounts for the possible coreferential reading.
   In (9) through (12) the noun is either in the same sentence as the pro-
noun or in a higher sentence than the pronoun. A coreferential reading is
also possible when the pronoun is higher in the tree, as in (16) and (17).

  The relationship command is redundant in the examples given so far in
identifying cases of noncoreference.   The examples in (20) through (22)
show the necessity of the command constraint.       These examples show
cases of possible coreference when a pronoun precedes a noun.       ?

order of the pronoun and noun reversed.        While (20) through (22) are
grammatical, they are definitely less acceptable than their counterparts
where the noun precedes the pronoun. In (20) through (22), the pronoun
always precedes the noun. In all cases, the node that immediately domi-
nates the pronoun does not dominate the noun. Command is the relevant
relationship: the pronouns precede but do not command the nouns so a
coreferential reading is not ruled out. The principle of noncoreference in
(23) operates to account for all the data presented.","[1081, 1082, 1083, 1084]"
"1. Many of the verb bases in which incorporated direct objects are found
can occur with an incorporated stem (a examples) or with a pronominal

nominal or pronominal direct object. Rather, any nominal or pronominal
object of a verb with an incorporated stem as object must be oblique. In
the examples in (147) through (149), the (a) forms show a verb with an
incorporated stem. The (b) forms show that an oblique nominal object is
possible. The (c) forms show that a nominal direct object does not occur
when an incorporated stem is present in the verb complex.    Finally, the
(d) forms show that it is not possible to have both an incorporated stem
and a pronominal direct object in the verb complex.(147)   a.   shetj                             's/he eats'

either be incorporated into the verb complex (a examples) or can occur
independently outside of the verb complex as a direct object (b examples).

transported.   When it is incorporated, it focusses on the manner of
transporting or moving rather than specifying the object being handled.
   When an incorporated object is modified, the modifying clause must be
oblique, as expected given the diagnostics above.     The modifying clause
may or may not contain an overt noun.      In (155) through (157), the (a)
sentences show a verb with an incorporated stem and a modifying clause
which is oblique that modifies this incorporated noun.    The (b) examples
show a verb without an incorporated stem and in these examples the
modified noun is a direct rather than an oblique object. The (c) examples
have an incorporated noun in the verb and an oblique modifying clause.

modifying clause is not oblique, creating the ungrammatically since the
direct object argument position is doubly filled.(155)   a.   njlaw'ine räkee  he        riw'irineh?a

They can be transitive, however, as (158) shows.
   In many cases, subjects that can occur incorporated into the verb can
also occur in an unincorporated form.      The example in (163) shows
independent subjects where that in (161) shows a comparable form with
an incorporated subject.(163)    shee t e n j ? a          'tail extends into water' (Hr)24.10.3.2.3   Adverbs
  Incorporated stems can function as manner adverbs.    These stems are
always part of the verb complex and can never occur independently of it
with similar meaning. Examples are given in (165) through (170). Forms
without the incorporated stem are given for comparison of meaning.(165)     radadere?j               's/he whispers'     (Hr)

        cf. k'eehdzoh                   Ί slid around'The examples in (168) and (169) show an interesting contrast with those
discussed in section 24.10.3.2.1.      The incorporated stems in section
24.10.3.2.1 function as direct objects.     The incorporated stems under
discussion in this section can cooccur with direct objects and are adverbial
rather than nominal in nature; in other words, they do not serve as
arguments of the verb. A particular noun can function in either way. The
examples in (171) and (172) show the stem xee- 'pack' as a noun (171)
and as an adverb (172).(171)   k'exeeechu                      's/he is walking around with a pack' (SI)(172)   k'exeesaachu                    's/he packed me around' (SI)It is clear that the stem xee- 'pack' is a direct object in (171) since there is
no other direct object and the verb base is transitive, requiring a direct
object. A direct object se- 'first person singular object' is present in (172).
   In Hare, when the incorporated stem xee- functions as an adverbial, a
pronominal direct object precedes rather than follows it.         This marked
ordering of incorporated stem and direct object apparently occurs only in
this construction. Some examples showing this marked order are given in
(173) and (174).(173)   tasexeedjshu                    'you sg. pack me down' (Hr)(174)   kayexeedehshii                  's/he packed him/her out' (Hr)In (173), the object pronoun se- first person singular is present and in
(174) the object pronoun ye- fourth person occurs.        These pronouns
unexpectedly precede the incorporated stem.
   Some speakers optionally include a direct object pronoun when xee- is
incorporated as an adverbial, even when the direct object is not normally
used.    The pronoun in these forms is a direct object rather than a
possessive pronoun.    If it were a possessive pronoun, the incorporated
stem would occur in the possessed form. The fact that it is not in the
possessed form indicates that the pronoun is an object.(175)   a.   tabexeedjshu               'you sg. pack it down' (Hr)
        b.   taxeedjshu(176)   a.   bebi t a h e x e e d j s h u 'you sg. pack the baby down' (Hr)
        b.   bebi t a x e e d j s h uIn (175a), the pronoun be- occurs as direct object. This pronoun is found
optionally as direct object when the object has human reference. See unit
666     Part III.    Categories7 for discussion. In (175a), it occurs even though the object can have a
nonhuman interpretation.        (175b) shows a word with the same
interpretation as (175a), but without the object pronoun.     In (176a), the
epenthetic syllable he- precedes the incorporated stem xee-.    This syllable
is not present in (176b).      It appears that the pronoun b e - and the
epenthetic he- are present for a functional purpose: they mark that xee-
is functioning as an adverbial rather than as a direct object. The ordering
of the prefixes is marked here as well, with the direct object preceding
the incorporated stem.
   Other incorporated stems function as locational or goal adverbs. Several
examples are given in (177) through (181).(177)    firad£ ? 9               's/he wears a hat on his/her head' (Hr)
         cf. we ? 9               'three dimensional Ο is located'
         -fighä                   'head hair'(178)    käjzedamj                's/he walked through slush snow' (SI)
         cf. jze                  'slush snow'(179)    kätfdijtse               's/he broke through ice' (SI)
         cf. tf                   'ice'(180)    chggohda                 'it is pregnant (object sits in its stomach)'
                                  (SI)
          cf. -chf                 'stomach'(181)     k'etadadah              's/he walked on water' (SI)
          cf. ta                  'water' (dependent form)   Another incorporated stem         that   serves   an   adverbial    function   is
illustrated in (182) and (183).(182)     beghä x a r e h w e e   Ί cuts the hair (I hair-cut the hair)' (Hr)
          3.hair lsg. cut hair
          cf. xa, -ghä            'hair'(183)     turi       xahdlä       's/he plucks the duck (s/he hair-pulls the
          duck       3 plucks     duck)' (Hr, Bl)The verbs in (182) and (183) have direct objects. It is possible that the
incorporated stem xa- 'hair' in these verbs once functioned as a direct
object. It is now some kind of adverb, as shown by the fact that the verbs
allow direct objects.","[705, 706, 707, 708, 709, 710]"
"   Thanks is also due to many students at the Teacher Education Program
in Fort Smith, Northwest Territories, Canada for their help. These include
Andy Norwegian (Fort Simpson), Jane Kenny (Fort Franklin), Doris

   Thanks also to the many other Dene people I met over the years who
helped make this work better.       These include Margaret Thom, Laura
Tutcho, Judy Tutcho, George Cleary, Doreen Cleary, and many more.
   Many, many thanks to all of these people.      Without them, this work
would have been impossible.
   Phil Howard contributed generously to this grammar in many ways.
He made tapes of the following people available: Sarah Norn (Hay River),
Sarah Sibbeston (Hay River), Raymond Sonfrere (Hay River), Willy
Bertram (Fort Liard), Laura McLeod (Fort Liard), Jimmy Cholo (Fort
Simpson), and Ted Trindell (Fort Simpson). Phil Howard also gave me free
access to his files for this forthcoming Slavey verb dictionary.   Without
these files, much of the work on aspect and verb theme categories would
not have been possible.
   The grammar also owes much the the work of other Athapaskan
specialists: Phil Howard, Cindy Chambers, Michael Kruass, Jim Kari, Vic
Monus, Gillian Story, Connie Naish, Ed Cook, Victor Golla, Jeff Leer, John
Ritter, and others. Special recognition goes to Lynda Ackroyd and Leslie

and friendship.
   Special thanks also to all of the people who housed me during my time
in the Northwest Territories.    I remember all of you with kindness and
gratitude.
   This project was funded by the Northern Social Research Division,
Department of Indian and Northern Affairs, Ottawa, Canada.
   This book has been many years in the coming.           The bulk of the
research was done between 1976 and 1982, and the major writing was
done between 1980 and 1983.       Since 1983, very little has been changed
in this grammar; this time has been spent in preparing the manuscript for
publication.    This became an overwhelmingly difficult task, largely
because of the size of the book. I would like to thank Marie-Louise Liebe-
Harkort, editor of Mouton de Gruyter, for continuing to encourage me at
times when I felt like abandoning the project and for being willing to
explore alternative ways of formatting the book to allow everything to be
included. I would also like to thank the following people for their support
over the past few years while I have been typing, editing, formatting, and
printing. These include, in addition to the linguists listed above, Sharon
Hargus, the faculty of the Department of Linguistics, University of Toronto
(especially Ron Wardhaugh and Jack Chambers, the department chairs
while this work has been going on) and students of the Department of
Linguistics, University of Toronto (in particular, I'd like to thank Peter
Avery and Bill Idsardi for encouragement and for help with the
computer).    To everyone else in the department, many thanks.        Many
thanks also to my family.
   This book is prepared on an Apple Macintosh computer and is printed
on the Apple LaserWriter.     Thanks to the Centre for Computing in the
Humanities of the University of Toronto for helping to defray the costs of

                            Introductory  Remarks
   This work is a reference grammar of the Slave (Dene) language.                    It
covers a wide range of topics, including phonetics, phonology, morphology,
syntax, and semantics. The goal of the work is to provide a description of
the Slave language.
   Slave ( Dene in the native language) is an Athapaskan 1 language spoken
in parts of the Northwest Territories, British Columbia, and A l b e r t a ,
Canada.     This grammar deals with the dialects spoken in the Northwest
Territories. Slave is made up of a number of distinct dialects. Four are
generally distinguished, Slavey, Bearlake, Hare, and Mountain.                  In the
spelling convention adopted here, 'Slave' ([slevi]) is used for the entire
language and 'Slavey' (also [slevi]), with a final orthographic                for the
specific dialect. Slavey itself divides into a number of dialects based on
community.
   Within each dialect, there is variation.  This variation is controlled by
several factors.     One type of variation I label ' c o n s e r v a t i v e '     and
'innovative.'   These terms are used throughout the text to characterize
different speech types within a community.         The d i f f e r e n c e between
conservative and innovative speech is correlated largely with age,
although other factors are also important.","[5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45]"
"Only humans are grammatically marked for plural in Slave.
  The object pronouns go- and ku- appear to be markers of human plural
number, parallel to the subject form ke-lge-.   As with the person pro-
nouns, the form of the human plural morpheme is dictated by its gram-
matical function. This is shown in the examples above where the object
pronoun is present only when the object is human. If the object is plural
nonhuman, no object pronoun is present. When noun objects are present,
the parallels beween ke-lge- and ku-lgo- become clear: they are markers
of human plural number. The use of go- and ku- as solely plural human
number is obscured when no nominal object is present because they are
extended in use to any plural oblique object.
  In general, the third person pronoun can be considered as unmarked for
number. It can combine with a human plural number morpheme to give
a marked plural form.
  When a noun is possessed by another noun, the same patterns emerge.
No plural number pronoun is present unless the possessor is human
plural.(69) a. dene lie                    'the man's dogs'
     b. deneke kuli6                'the men's dogs'
     c. Mary gokoe                  'Mary and their house'(70) a. tsä do                     'the beaver's / beavers' food'
     b. """"tsä kudoIn inalienably possessed nouns, ; . pronoun must precede the noun (71).
The plural pronoun occurs only if the possessor is human (72).(71) a. dene bekwi                 'the man's head' (Bl)
     b. tlj bechee                 'the dog's tail' (Bl)

                                                         The Pronouns     1019(72) a. ?ehkee kukee                 'the boys' feet, the boy's feet' (Hr)
     b. chi mek'oh                   'the ducks' necks, the duck's neck' (SI)  When a noun is present, person is not marked by a pronoun but num-
ber is.   Third person pronouns are generally unmarked for number and
can combine with a human plural feature to give a marked plural.
Oblique object pronouns show that this system is changing as singular -
plural distinctions must be signalled in the obliques.","[1062, 1063]"
"24.2.3.4      Reciprocal   Like in reflexives, the d- classifier is added to themes with 0 and h-
classifiers to form reciprocals.    It is added when there is a reciprocal
direct object ?ete- (Bl, SI, Mt)/?e/e- (Hr). (115) through (119) show verbs
with the 0 or A- classifier and nonreflexive objects in the (a) forms and
verbs with a reflexive object and the d- classifier in the (b) forms.(115)      a. r a s e r e y j h t ' u     's/he hit me' (Hr)

occurs when the object of this postposition is the reciprocal pronoun.      In
(120) through (122), the (a) forms show a nonreciprocal form with the 0
or h- classifiers and the (b) forms a reciprocal form with the d- classifier.(120)    a. b e n e h l j                         Ί like him/her' (Bl)

         b. ? e l e t s ' e k e d e h g w e n e   'they dislike each       other'   The d- classifier is not found when a reciprocal oblique object is present
unless the postposition is one of the t w o listed a b o v e .    With other
postpositions, only the thematic classifier is present. This is shown in the
examples in (123) through (125), where a nonreciprocal form is shown in
(a) and a reciprocal form in (b).(123)    a. y e g h g ? e d i d e ? 9             's/he loves him/her'         (Hr)

intransitives with only one thematic role.

examples with this prefix and the d- classifier are given in the (b) forms.(126)      a. r ä w e                             's/he stands' (Hr)

again' or na- 'customary' is present in an intransitive base.     In the
examples in (129) through (132), the (a) form shows an intransitive verb
with the 0 or A- classifier. The (b) forms, and (c) forms when they are
present, show verbs with na- present and the d- classifier.           a. d e ? e e                           'he starts off by boat' (Hr)

as shown in (133) through (135). The (a) examples are forms without the
morpheme na- and the (b) examples forms with the morpheme na-.(133)       a. s e g h a n j w a                  'you sg. give pi. Ο to me'(Hr)

reflexives, reciprocals, customary, and iterative forms, with the final two
only in intransitive verbs. All of these functions share common features:
an intransitive with only one thematic role results from the word
formation process.     In all cases, the action essentially returns on itself.
Tenenbaum (1978) expresses this as follows:  Vocalization (i.e. 0 -» d , t - > 1) occurs in the following cases:
     1) in intransitives with 'repeated action/reversed motion'
                           Gr

  In all cases where vocalization occurs, and in no case where it does not
  occur, the direction of the predication, the force of the verb or action,
  symbolized by the arrow, returns to or points to the primary
  participant, symbolized by the left-hand dot.   (pages 129-130)  There is thus a unity to the meaning of the d- classifier as a derivational
component: it produces intransitives and marks theme focus.
  The h- classifier, in its derivational function, produces transitives and
marks agent or location focus.
466      Part III.     Categories24.2.4       Thematic           status      of   the   classifiers  In section 24.2.3, the productive derivational use of the d- and h-
classifiers is discussed.  While these classifiers clearly have derivational
functions, it remains the case that they must be considered part of the
verb theme, as discussed in section 24.2.2.
  The examples that most clearly show that the classifiers are thematic
come from the classificatory verb themes and the verb themes that are
suppletive for number.    In these cases, the classifier can vary from one
theme to another for no apparent reason. The examples in (136) through
(141) show a number of the different classificatory and related verb
themes. The themes have 0 , h-, and d- thematic classifiers.       The verb
stems occur in the order imperfective, perfective, optative, future.(136)      0 - l e e , -la, -iee, - i e e          'handle plural O'

related verb themes ((140) and (141)).         The semantic distinctions
between these themes have to do with the nature of the objects handled
and the manner of handling. No semantic difference is associated with the
classifiers. It is clear from these examples that the classifiers are not
predictable but rather are part of the verb theme.

                        'he gave us the fish Bill caught'These sentences show relative clauses where the double role noun is an
object, oblique (8, 9, 10) or direct (11, 12), within the restricting sentence.
   Two facts suggest that the double role noun is contained within the re-
stricting sentence. The first is word order. In sentences such as (6) and
(11), the word order within the restricting sentence is Subject Object
Verb. If the double role noun were part of the higher sentence, as in (4),
one would expect the matrix object to precede the complement subject.
   The second fact that indicates that the double role noun is part of the
restricting sentence is the lack of pronouns as objects. If the double role
noun in a sentence such as (8) were part of the matrix, a pronominal ob-
ject of the postposition would be required in the subordinate clause since
a postposition must have an object argument. Since there is no pronomi-
nal object, the noun must be within the same sentence as the postposition.
   In internally headed relative clauses, there is no external head noun
and the double role noun occurs within the restricting sentence. A rule of
semantic interpretation indexes a noun phrase within a subordinate
clause with the noun phrase that dominates it, allowing the noun phrase
to be interpreted as part of both the higher and the lower sentences.
   Sentences can be ambiguous: more than one noun in the restricting sen-
tence can be interpreted as a double role noun, as in (13) and (14).(13) lj    gah         hedehfe   i     ghäyeyidä

potential ambiguity, the first noun is generally interpreted as the double
role noun. This is not always so, as is evident from (11), repeated below.(11) yenene k o e        gohsj         i     segha       gonezo

sentence despite the fact that the word yenene       'woman' is the first noun
of the restricting sentence because yenene       cannot serve as an object of
the higher sentence 'it is good for me.' The higher verb has an areal ob-
ject go- and yenene    is not interpreted areally. If yenene    is to be inter-
preted as head noun, the sentence must be as in (15), without the areal
pronoun on the higher verb.(15)   yenene k o e        gohsj        i    segha         nezo

       'you gave me the moose that your son shot with the gun' (SI)In (16), the verb theme 0-tln in the matrix requires an object that has the
quality of being extended and rigid. In (17), the verb theme in the matrix
requires an object that is animate. The choice of matrix verb restricts the
potential choice of nouns to fill the double role: semantically, only one of
the nouns within the restricting sentence can be interpreted in the matrix.
   These examples show that relative clauses can have internal heads.      In
general, it is the first noun of the lower sentence that is interpreted as
head noun unless the matrix verb imposes restrictions that force the
choice of another noun as the head.
   Before discussing externally headed relative clauses, a note on relative
clauses when relativization is into subject position is in order. In the rel-
                                                              Relative Clauses   1313ative clauses above, relativization is into object position and it is clear that
the double role nominal is in the restricting sentence. 5      When relativiza-
tion is into subject position, it is not clear whether the double role noun is
part of the matrix or the restricting sentence.     Word order does not help
decide as the subject is the first word of the sentence. Pronouns also do
not help as the subject pronouns do not vary in form.           Sentences like
those in (18) through (22), where the double role noun is the subject of
the restricting sentence, may thus come from an internally headed struc-
ture, as in (4), or an externally headed structure, as in (5).         ?                                            ?

sentence is the same as the standard order for simple sentences. It is also
possible for the double role noun to occur to the left of the restricting
sentence, as an external head noun. In (23) and (24), the relative clauses
appear in a structure like (5), with an external head noun. The head noun
is placed in brackets. (23) should be compared with (6) and (24) with (8).(23)     [lue] seyaa            iayenihde     sii   meghänila

1314     Part V. SyntaxThese examples show the two kinds of evidence for an externally headed
relative clause structure.   In (23), the object of 'kill', 'fish,' precedes the
subject. In both (23) and (24), there is an object pronoun present, the di-
rect object ye- in (23) and an oblique object be- in (24). The presence of
the object pronoun indicates that there is not an object noun in the same
simplex sentence. The double role noun must be in the matrix rather than
in the restricting sentence. 6

ative clauses in (9) through (12) are given in (25) through (28).(25)     [dene]     beghä soba         rinela    yile i       radehta

                    'you gave me the moose that your son shot with the gun' (SI)  For internally headed relative clauses, a rule of interpretation links a
noun in the restricting sentence to the noun phrase dominating it so that
                                                                           ηthe noun phrase can be interpreted as part of two sentences.     For inter-
nally headed relative clauses, an interpretation rule interprets the head
noun as anaphoric to a pronoun within the restricting sentence.    If these
interpretations are not possible the sentence is filtered out.","[1354, 1355, 1356, 1357, 1358]"
"6. As mentioned in note 1, the system is far more complex than indicated
   in this chapter.    I have barely touched on the interaction of the se-
   mantic aspect system (imperfective, perfective) with the structural as-
   pect     system (momentaneous, continuative, repetitive, etc.).  Each of
   these structural aspects can occur in the different semantic aspects.
   These structural aspects represent a number of different verb cate-
   gories.    Different categories interact with the semantic aspect system
   in a variety of ways. For instance, as mentioned in the text, the use of
   momentaneous and semelfactive in the imperfective is limited.        This
   chapter simply gives an overview of some of the more salient charac-

                                                 Yes/No Questions
   There are three strategies for forming yes/no questions in Slave, each
with a different meaning. In one case, the questioner has no e x p e c t a t i o n
as to the response to the question. In the second case, a positive answer is
expected. The third case involves focus questions, where a particular con-
stituent is questioned and the rest of the sentence is presupposed. These
three question types are discussed in this chapter.

  Yes/no questions can be formed using the question particle asi (Bl, Mt
form). This particle has different forms depending on dialect, as in (1).

interpreted as anaphoric since although the pronoun precedes the noun, it
does not c o m m a n d it. However, the noncoreferential interpretation given
in (48) is the only one generally considered acceptable.(48)     ts'enjwe ί                tl'a             John   ko    godiia

                  'after hej got up, Johnj made fire'   In some cases, a coreferential interpretation is judged acceptable f r o m a
structure like (47). Such an example is given in (49).                                                                        ?

                          'after she ; visited her friend, Mary ; went home'The reflexive pronoun de- is coreferential to the pronominal subject of the
sentence.        This subject can be interpreted as coreferential to 'Mary,' as
predicted by (38).
   The question arises as to whether sentences such as (48) are truly un-
grammatical with a coreferential interpretation or whether such an inter-
pretation is simply highly marked.                              If the interpretation is truly disal-
lowed for (48) but allowed for (49), it will be difficult to predict when
coreferentiality is possible since both sentences have the same structural
configuration. If (48) is ungrammatical, it will also be necessary to refine
the n o n c o r e f e r e n c e i n t e r p r e t a t i o n rule since it p r e d i c t s a c o r e f e r e n t i a l
reading. The pronoun precedes but does not command the noun.
   It appears that the lack of a coreferential reading for (48) has to do with
the reading being highly marked rather than u n g r a m m a t i c a l .                           T h e fact
that sentences such as (49) are judged grammatical and that some speak-
ers find sentences such as (48) to be marginal rather than unacceptable
suggest that they may have been fully grammatical at one time.                                      I would
like to suggest that two processes are underway in Slave that conspire to
make the coreferential readings of low acceptability.
   First, there is a general tendency in Slave for nouns to precede pro-
1046   Part V.   Syntaxnouns: the precedence relation is more important than the command rela-
tion. Sentences where the pronoun precedes the noun ((20) through (22))
are generally of somewhat lower acceptability than those where the noun
precedes the pronoun.     While both precedence and command are impor-
tant in Slave, it appears to be more valued for the noun to precede the
pronoun than for the pronoun to not command the noun.
   Second, it appears that the postpositions in question are in the process
of being reanalyzed such that they have lexical entries as conjunctions as
well as postpositions. There are two syntactic arguments for this claim.
   Some postpositions clearly function as conjunctions as well.     This is
clearest with the postposition -hi (Hr, Bl) / -ih (SI) 'with.'","[1089, 1090]"

(32) n i n a x e d j d h a h                 's/he picked us up' (SI)  In some cases, this pronoun has the form naxo-lraxo-.   This seems to be
the case when it directly precedes the n- conjugation marker (33) in Hare
and the 0 conjugation perfective in all dialects (34).(33) ts'eraxonjwa                             's/he woke up, s/he woke you pi.' (Hr)

If the verb
base requires a second role, it is the object of an incorporated postposition,

24.7.14       Phonology  Most aspects of the phonology of the direct object prefixes are discussed
in unit 4. Only a few points require further clarification.
   In unit 4, a vowel deletion rule was formulated, deleting the first of two
adjacent vowels in conjunct prefixes. This rule was adequate for cases of
vowel-vowel sequences discussed in that unit.       When direct object and
deictic pronouns are considered, this rule must be refined. When a direct
object pronoun directly precedes a vowel-initial morpheme, the vowel of
the pronoun is lost if it is Id. This is shown in (75) through (77).

     e            weakThe weaker of two adjacent vowels in conjunct prefixes is always deleted.
This means that /e/ is always deleted when it is adjacent to another
vowel. When /a/ is adjacent to another vowel, it is always maintained.
  One more phonological process that affects direct object prefixes must
be mentioned.     When the object pronoun ki-lgi- is directly followed by
the w- conjugation marker, the vowel of the conjugation marker is
deleted, as expected after a conjunct morpheme.          See unit 4.       An
epenthetic syllable ye- (Hr)/e- (Bl, SI, Mt) is present between the pronoun
and the subject prefix. This syllable is epenthetic and not the fourth
person pronoun ye- because the fourth person pronoun does not cooccur
with ki-lgi- and because its initial consonant is always present; it is not a
prefix that has an alternative form e-.          Some illustrations of this
epenthetic syllable are given in (91) and (92).(91) kiyehsj                   'they made it' (Hr)

                           Pronominal Prefixes -          Summary
  The pronominal prefixes in positions 6 and 7 sometimes pattern like
conjunct prefixes and sometimes like disjunct prefixes with respect to
phonological rules.   The prefixes are further subdivided into two groups
with      unspecified, ke-lge- human plural number, and ts'e- unspecified
number in one set and the rest of the pronouns in another. The reflexive
?ede- and the reciprocal ?eie- form a set by themselves.
   The chart below compares the phonological patterning of ?e-,        ke-lge-,
ts'e- with the rest of the pronouns with respect to a number of different
phonological processes.    A '+' in the conjunct column means that the
prefixes are like conjunct prefixes with respect to the rule in question and
a '+' in the disjunct column means that they are like disjunct prefixes.                                  conjunct              disjunct  epenthesis in 0

raised vowels when nasalized by the n- conjugation marker. The other

In Hare, verbs with thematic prefixes must have two occurrences of the

   The classifiers found in the comparative aspect require some comment.
In general, the classifier associated with a given theme remains constant
unless another classifier is introduced by a rule such as passive formation.
This is not the case with the comparative aspect, however. Here the form
of the classifier is dependent on mode and can differ from one dialect to
another. This information is summarized in (105).(105)                     imperfective    perfective

'it is so thick' (compare with ditan 'it is thick'). It is possible that the h- in
Slave is not actually a classifier historically, but just looks like a classifier.
Just what its source is is unclear and its distribution is unusual.

This descriptive verb theme occurs in the neuter aspect.
   The base -έ + {h, 0} - t'e, has the meaning 'be like, similar.' Conjugation

12.2         Stem nouns ( 0     suffixed forms)  A noun can be composed of a root with a null               stem   formative      suffix.
162        Part III.     CategoriesThese nouns are often called stem nouns.     They usually name physical
entities such as naturally occurring objects and represent some of the
oldest vocabulary of the language.   See Young and Morgan (1980: 8) for

  Many of these stems are used not only as nouns, but also as verbs, as
shown by the examples in ( 1 ) above.
  T h e list of nouns in this section includes only those with an
independent, non-possessed f o r m .  There are many nouns with a null
suffix that must be possessed. These are discussed in section 12.5.
                                                                      Nouns   16312.3     Other stem    formatives   In the examples in section 12.2, the noun stem and the root are identical
since the stem is formed by the affixing a null suffix to the root. In some
cases, the stem is formed from the root by adding a stem formative suffix
that is not null. There are two of these in Slave. One, the suffix -e or -i is
common and the second, the suffix -I, is found with only a few words.12.3.1   -e  The suffix -e (or -/) is most likely a nominalizer historically. It has no
apparent function in the language synchronically, but is simply required
as a stem formative by some roots. This suffix occurs in the nonpossessed
form. In the possessed form it is deleted and replaced by the possessive
suffix -έ. Several examples of this suffix are given in the data in (3).(3) non-possessed     possessed
    t'eere            -t'eer6       'girl' (Hr, Bl)
    luge              -lug6         'fish' (Hr)
    tene              -ten£         'path'
    ?
      oge                           'eddy' (Hr)
    dzene             -dzene        'day'
    ts'ale            -ts'al6       'frog'
    ?
      ejire           -?ejire       'buffalo, cattle'
    turi              -tur6         'duck'The fact that this vowel is lost when the possessive suffix -έ is added
suggests that it is a suffix synchronically and not part of the root since
root vowels are never deleted.
  Suffixed nouns may be related to verb forms as well.(4) fole          'merganser'       -fo            'be yellow' (Hr)12.3.2 -/  The suffix -/ is found on some nouns. Its identity as -/ is apparent from
the possessed form, where it surfaces as [1]. This suffix is historically an
instrumental, used to derive instrument noun stems from roots. It occurs
in the forms in (5) and (6). The fact that a suffix is present can be seen by
comparing the nouns with related verb forms, where -I is not found.(5) xeeh          -gheeli           'pack, load'
    -xee                            'pack' (verb)(6) tl'uh         -tl'ule           'rope'
    -tl'u                           'tie' (verb)These are the only two nouns that I know of that require this suffix.
164      Part III.     Categories12.3.4      Summary  Non-possessed nouns are formed from roots by the affixation of one of
three stem forming suffixes, as shown in (7).(7)      -e, -1, - 0The first two are not used productively.","[205, 206, 207, 208]"

41.2    Pronouns and          topics  As mentioned in section 41.1, when a noun occurs in topic position there
must be a pronoun within the proposition that is free in reference and
interpreted as coreferential to the noun.    With constituents other than
nouns, there is no pronoun.
  The specific form of the pronoun is determined by its person, case, and
other factors, as discussed in chapter 28. Pronouns are discussed in detail
in that chapter and are summarized here.  (a) If a fourth person object is in topic position, the pronoun within the
proposition is ye-.  (b) If a third person object (i.e. object of a verb with a nonthird person
subject) is a topic, the pronoun within the proposition is 0 (direct object)
or be-ime-   (oblique object).   (c) If a first or second person pronoun is a topic, the pronoun within
the proposition is first or second person respectively.",[1252]
"41.1.1.5  Summary
  Noun phrases can occur freely as topics. In all cases, there is a pronoun
in the proposition that can be interpreted as coreferential to the topic
noun.",[1247]

24.17.8         The      verb   stem   - further   classification  There are numerous verb themes in Slave that classify objects.     Many
are discussed in earlier parts of this chapter.    There are many more
classifying themes in Slave.  These themes classify in various ways: by
type of object involved, by manner involved in carrying out an action, and
by number.

handled are discussed in sections 24.17.2 and 24.17.3.         These are
traditionally called classificatory verbs.  There are many more verb
themes in Slave that indicate characteristics of their object.    A small
number of these verbs are given in the examples below.(33) 0 -tie, -tie, -tie              'handle uncontained wet mass (mud, dough)'

movement is carried out but do not indicate the nature of the object
affected by the action. In many cases, there are two verb themes which
differ only in terms of control. Some of these themes are listed in the
examples in (37) through (43).    In many cases only themes are given

752    Part III.   CategoriesFirst, there is an postposition -e that occurs primarily in the dialects of
Hare and Bearlake.     In many cases where a null postposition occurs in
Slavey, as described in section 24.14.2.1, these dialects have the post-
position -e. The presence of this postposition is most evident when there
is a nominal object because in this case the postposition is actually pho-
netically present. Generally in Hare and sometimes in Bearlake an epen-
thetic [h] occurs and the postposition is phonetically [he]. When the verb
has a pronominal object, the rule of vowel deletion deletes one of the two
vowels. See unit 4.
   Hare and Bearlake verbs with the postposition -e are given in (57)
through (61). Verbs with both pronominal and nominal objects are given.(57) e # k'e # 0 = di, -di, -di   'keep, care for' (imperfective, perfective,

       mother  Verbs in these dialects with the direct object ?e- unspecified or go-
are al indicating the semantic theme have as goal an oblique object where
the postposition is -e, rather than the null postposition found in Slavey.
In the examples in (62) through (66), the (a) forms show a verb with the
morpheme            unspecified as direct object and a pronoun as oblique
object. The (b) forms have a noun as oblique object.(62) a. beshg^erihse            Ί burst it open' (Hr)

     b. deshjkäle heke ? editl'i   'you sg. nail the board up'
        board  While in most cases where Slavey has a null postposition, Hare and
Bearlake have the postposition -e, in some cases there is no phonetic
postposition in these dialects either. The forms in (40), (41), and (42) are
from the Hare and Bearlake dialects. It appears that this postposition -e is
developing in these dialects, leading to the phonetic presence of a post-
position whenever there is an oblique object.
   In passive and intransitive construction as found in (47) through (51),
the postposition -e does not occur.
  Reflexives and reciprocals formed on themes with -e require the d-
classifier. This can be seen in the (b) forms of (67) and (68).(67) a. be?jhdza                'you sg. measure it' (Hr, Bl)
     b. ? e d e ? i d z a       'you sg. measure yourself

24.14.2.2 solely on the basis of the fact that it occurs as part of the verb
base in all dialects. Several examples of this postposition are given in (69)
through (77). Forms with both pronominal and nominal objects are given.
The pronominal objects show by their position that these objects are
indeed oblique objects.       The nominal objects show that there is a

14.2        Uninflected           stems  A number of different stems can be used to modify nouns.              As
modifiers, these stems are never inflected for person or number. In many
cases, a dependent suffix -e, a suffix which never occurs in the inflected
form, is present when these stems function as qualifiers.
  Many descriptive and dimensional verb theme category stems can be
238      Part III.    Categoriesused as modifiers in this way.    Stems from other verb theme categories
may also be used.

class contained in the class named by the noun.          In (13), the qualified
form represents a class different from but sharing characteristics of the
modified noun. The nouns in (14) do not generally occur without -cho.
   While -cho is often translated as 'big,' it is clear from (12) through (14)
that this is not an accurate gloss. The meaning 'big' is obtained by using
the verb nechä (Bl, SI, Mt)/A/sAd (Hr), as illustrated in the data in (15).(15) a. tlj nechä                       'big dog'(Bl, SI, Mt)

  The diminutive marks a class that is smaller than or younger than the

in nature, marking the smallest of a category, -tsile is comparative. A
noun modified by -tsile is smaller than the noun but not necessarily the
smallest of the type.    Like other modifying stems, -tsile    indicates one
particular species of the type indicated by the noun (25) or different from

modifiers. Generally the modified noun is a subclass of the class specified
by the noun.   With the exceptions of the augmentative and diminutive,
most stem modifiers are not used productively.
                                                                 Qualifiers   24714.3       Agreement  A qualifier must agree in gender with a preceding areal noun. This is
shown in the examples in (66). The nouns are areal, and the gender prefix
go- areal is required on the modifier.(66)   a. k o e g o c h o             'town,       society'

14.4    -ke          plural  The plural or group marker -ke is a suffix that can be added to nouns.
It occurs only with a certain class of animate nouns, people and dogs.
Several examples are given in (67).(67)   a. s e y a                     'my son' (Hr)
          seyake                      'my sons'

       f. lit                         'dog' (Hr)
           like                       'dogs'The use of -ke to indicate plurality is optional as plural reference can be
specified by context alone.
  The plural or group suffix -ke follows all other nominal modifiers.    In
the examples in (68) it is shown following qualifiers; in those in (69) it
follows the diminutive and augmentative, in those in (70) it follows the
possessive suffix, and in those in (71) it follows the nominalizer -i.(68)   a. m o l a w ä k e             'French       people'

        dene 'person' + hjshä 's/he is big' + -i nominalizer + -ke plural   The suffix -ke does not co-occur with to, hito 'many.' This is because it
specifies a group plural; its occurrence with io, h j f o would lead to a
contradictory interpretation.
   When the subject of a sentence is marked for plurality by the suffix -ke,
it is not necessary to use the human plural number prefix ke- in the verb.
All the sentences in the sets in (72) and (73) are grammatical. In the (a)
examples, -ke occurs on the subject noun. In the (b) examples, the prefix
ke- occurs on the verb. In the (c) examples, both the subject and the verb
are marked for plurality.(72) a. John beyake 7 eyä yile        'John's sons were sick'

modify. This can be seen by examining their phonology and morphology.
The phonology is looked at in this section.
  As discussed in chapter 5, stem-initial continuants in Slave are
underlyingly unspecified for a value of the feature [voice].      They are
voiced when preceded by a syllable within the same word in nouns and
postpositions and are voiceless otherwise.     Continuant-initial qualifiers
begin, with one exception, with voiced continuants, as shown (74).(74) a. ? e k w f w a a                          'barren land caribou' (Bl)
       b. i e t ' e h d h u e                    'store bread' (SI)

       g. liboghine                               'bowl'The exception is -iine 'bad, evil,' which begins with a voiceless continuant.
   Since voicing occurs only within a word, these qualifiers must be part of
the same lexical word as the noun for the structural description of voicing
to be met.","[281, 282, 283, 284, 285, 286, 287, 288, 289, 290, 291, 292, 293]"
"26.1.5   The output of the lexicon   The theme is the basic unit of the lexicon. In addition to themes, the
lexicon includes affixes. Each affix and theme is listed in the lexicon along
with its idiosyncratic properties, phonological, morphological, syntactic,
and semantic.
   This model of the lexicon does not have full words listed in the lexicon,
but rather forms words from themes by rules of word formation. The re-
sult of word formation is that many possible words will be generated, not
all of which are actually occurring words of the language.
   The possible words can be divided into several types.       There are the
actually occurring words of the language. There are items that are acci-
dental gaps: they could be words but simply do not exist, or exist in one
dialect but not in another. This type of word is well-formed in every way
but it is just not used. In addition to generating actual words and acci-
dental gaps, the word formation rules can also produce words that are
systematic gaps. These are words that are morphologically and syntacti-
978      Part IV. The Modelcally well-formed but semantically ill-formed.
    Semantically ill-formed words are basically those in which features fail
to match.      For instance, if a verb has a momentaneous prefix but a
semelfactive stem, it is semantically ill-formed.     Other examples of se-
mantically ill-formed words include the following: a conjugation marker
present in the primary aspectual string that is not the conjugation marker
required by the verb theme category of that verb theme, a verb with one
mode marked by the prefixes and a different mode marked by the stem, a
verb with an adverb prefix requiring one conjugation marker but with a
different conjugation marker actually present, a verb with an aspect-de-
termining prefix and a stem in a different aspect, a verb with a third per-
son subject and a third rather than a fourth person object. These seman-
tically ill-formed words are eliminated from the list of actual words by
rules of logical form, rules that filter out words whose features do not
agree.
    All the examples of semantically ill-formed words given so far involve
feature matching violations.      Words may also be rejected on semantic
grounds because of an inconsistency between semantic properties of dif-
ferent morphemes.       For instance, the adverbial prefix ts'e- 'awaken' can
 occur with classificatory themes, but only with those that allow animate
nouns as the thematic role theme. This prefix does not occur, for instance,
 with the classificatory verb 'handle a sticklike object.' The fact that this
prefix and stem do not cooccur is not a morphological or structural fact,
 but is rather a semantic fact. It would be possible to use the word 'wake
 up sticklike object' in some other world context. As another example, op-
 erative theme category verbs can occur with the conative prefix u-, as in
 ts'udgdla   'yell at.' Many transitive operative themes do not occur with
 this prefix. For example, the form 'comb at' does not occur with it. This
 gap too is due to semantic constraints on what activities can be done
 without completion. These words simply receive no interpretation.","[1021, 1022]"
"
29.2      Unspecified      subjects  The unspecified subject pronoun ts'e- can be used to avoid reference to
a particular subject. When this pronoun is present, the agent is unknown
or unimportant.    While the use of the unspecified subject is similar in
meaning to the passive, it is not a structural passive. Some examples are
given in (16) through (20).(16) sefighä lets'eyighe              'someone cut my hair' (Hr)

                               Coreference
   The goal of this chapter is to answer the following question: when can a
noun phrase and a pronoun be interpreted as coreferential?
   Potential coreferential relationships can be determined by a rule that
states when a noun and noun or pronoun must be noncoreferential. If the
rule does not mark them as obligatorily noncoreferential, then they may
or may not be interpreted as coreferential.
   Coreference between a noun and pronoun is determined on the basis of
two relationships, precedence and command.        Some structural configura-
tions of nouns and pronouns allow for the possibility of a coreferential
interpretation while others do not.
   In section 30.1, definitions of these two relationships are given. Sec-
tions 30.2 and 30.3 deal with the parameters involved in coreference,
precedence and command. Coordinate structures are discussed in sections
30.4 and 30.5.","[1077, 1078, 1079]"

"11.1.1   Noun   Nouns are defined largely on the basis of inflection: they can be
inflected with the possessive pronouns. They are also defined on the basis
of distribution: nouns function as subjects and objects.     A variety of
morphological types of nouns fall into this category, including simple
nouns, obligatorily inflected nouns, compound nouns, and nouns derived
from verbs. Independent pronouns also fall into this class. They have the
same distribution as nouns but differ from nouns in that they can never
be inflected for possession. Included in the category of pronouns are the
emphatic pronouns (e.g. sen[ 'my' (Hr, Bl) and the interrogative pronouns
(e.g. ?amii 'who' (Bl, Sh Mt), "">ayli 'what' (Bl, SI, Mt)).",[201]

45.4    Lexical   features   Verbs allowing direct discourse interpretation of their complements
must be diacritically marked in the lexicon since there do not seem to be
features that this follows from.      Since there are two different kinds of
direct discourse-determining verbs, two features are needed, one for
direct statements (statements to someone) and one for indirect statements
(statements about someone).
   This diacritic feature is apparently not a property of the verb theme, as
the following examples show. The verb theme 0-ni 'say, speak' requires a
direct discourse interpretation of the complement in some cases while in
other cases it requires an indirect discourse interpretation        (?ek0-e-de-0-
ni). The verb theme 0-when      (Bearlake form) is similar: the base     ye-ne-0-
                                                                            7
when    'want' takes a direct discourse complement while the base             a-h-
w h e n 'cause, affect' requires an indirect discourse complement.               It
appears that the diacritic indicating direct discourse is actually a feature
of prefixes rather than of themes since a given theme can take
complements of either discourse type. 4
45.5     Summary  Complement-taking verbs in Slave are of two types, those requiring
direct discourse interpretation of the complement and those requiring
indirect discourse interpretation. These types of interpretation differ by
the point of view from which the pronouns of the complement sentence
are interpreted.
  Possible anaphoric relations in Slave are determined by rules of control
and noncoreference interpretation, (chapters 30, 42).   A similar rule is
1292    Part V   Syntaxneeded to interpret coreference relations of complement pronouns of a
direct discourse verb.     The rule of direct discourse interpretation is
outlined in section 45.2.     Two rules are required, one for reporting
statements to someone and one for reporting statements about someone.
These rules are given in (36) and (44). A rule similar to control discussed
in chapter 42 marks possible coreference relations between the object of
the transitive 'want' and complement pronouns.      If there is no possible
coreference relation between the object and pronouns in the complement,
the direct discourse control filter marks the sentence as ungrammatical.","[1335, 1336]"

24.2.2     Function   of the   classifiers  The classifiers can each play a morphosyntactic role indicating voice.
Each can also code the thematic role of the subject with respect to the
verb.    In addition, the classifiers may be purely thematic, with no clear
function. Each verb theme includes a classifier. All bases with additional
classifiers derive from the verb theme.
   The classifiers fall into two sets, where 0:d-:\h-:l-; in other words, the
relationship beween 0 and d- is similar to that between h- and /-. 4
   In the following sections, examples of classifiers that are part of the
verb theme are given.        While each verb theme entry must include a
classifier, to some extent these thematic classifiers can be assigned a
morphosyntactic function.      It is the morphosyntactic functions of these
thematic classifiers that are discussed below.24.2.2.1 0 classifier
  The 0 classifier is primarily an intranstive/noncausative marker.        It
indicates that the verb must have a noun in the thematic role of theme.
The verb may also have an agent.
  Most verb themes indicating states (i.e. those requiring neuter aspect as
primary aspectual string) have a 0 classifier. Examples are given in (34).(34)     hjdzeege                    'it is gummy' (Hr)

in intransitive/noncausative forms which indicate processes.(35)     whegp                       'it is dried' (Bl)

have the 0 classifier.(37)    rasere?a                           's/he fools me' (Hr)

24.2.2.2 h- classifier
   The primary role of the h- classifier is to signal transitivity/causativity.
Its presence indicates that the verb must have an agent and a theme.         In
(38), the h- classifier is thematic.  See section 24.2.3 for discussion of the
derivational use of the h- classifier.(38)    yiht'o                             Ί    sucked it'

suggested that historically the d- classifier was used when the subject was
a nonagent. This would account for its use in all of the examples given
above. Synchronically, it is not used productively in this way and must be
listed as part of the verb theme.
   The d- classifier also occurs thematically in some transitive themes.(41)   yadg                       's/he drank it'

  The /- classifier is part of the lexical entry of some verb themes.          It is
found largely in intransitive themes. Some are given in (42).(42)   nähzee                     Ί hunt' (Bl)

       deandie                    's/he was hungry' (SI)As discussed in section 24.2.1.5, it is often impossible to tell whether a
verb theme has the d- or the /- classifier.      The examples in (42) are
clearly /- classifier verbs; the stems begin with consonants that would
show the effect of the D-Effect Rule if the d- classifier were present. In as
much as thematic classifiers can be assigned a morphosyntactic role, the
d- and /- classifiers are similar in that they are both found mainly in
intransitive themes.","[495, 496, 497]"

42.2      Object nouns and          pronouns  There are many verbs that are subcategorized for an object, direct or
oblique, and a complement sentence (2b, 2c, 2d, 2f). In many cases, this
object must be preferential to the complement subject. 7 In this section,
these matrix objects/complement subjects and the relationship between
the nouns and the pronouns that occur in them are discussed.
   A matrix object and complement subject are often coreferential. Some
examples are shown in (57) through (60).(57)     sechile                  [ na ? ehdl0 ] 7 a s ί l ä

"28.1.1      Singular pronouns  The pronouns 0 , be-lme-, ye-, and 7ede-/de-   indicate third and fourth
person objects and possessors. The required form is determined by syn-
tactic and semantic factors. First, the form is determined by a syntactic
criterion: the grammatical relation of the pronoun to the category that
governs it.    Second, it is determined by semantic factors: features of
person, number, and potential humanness of the subject and the object.28.1.1.1 ye-
  ye- is a fourth person object pronoun, an anaphor used when the sub-
ject is third person. It indicates that the object must be noncoreferential
to the subject. It functions as direct object (2), oblique object (3), and
possessor of an object noun (4).(2) niatsoyenetse                     's/he squashed him/her/it' (SI)(3) yegäh             näetlah       's/he jumped down next to him/her/it' (SI)

oblique object is third person.
  A semantic factor, agentivity, determines another use of be-lme-.   (3), a
sentence with an oblique object and a third person subject, has a subject
that can be an agent and the object pronoun is ye-.        When the subject
must be a nonagent, be-lme- is required as oblique object. This use of
be-lme- with a nonagentive subject is shown in (12) through (17).(12)     tet'eh     megha nezy             'bread is good for him/her'

that the subject is third person.    (18) through (21) show that agentivity

       c. * ? i d i i a m a t l a
                    3 split 3  The use of the third person oblique object be-lme-        rather than fourth
person y e - is correlated with the thematic role of agentivity: if the subject
can be interpeted as an agent, then ye- is used as oblique object while if it
cannot be interpreted as an agent, then be-lme-     is used. A sentence such
as (24) can be grammatical.(24)    bebi y j t l ' a d a w e                 'the baby fell from his/her hand' (Hr)
                                                 (cf. (20b))In (24), the action is interpreted as volitional on the part of the baby, as a
controlled action. The (b) versions of (19) through (21) have a nonagent
reading as primary and thus the pronoun be-lme-        is found.
  Why is be-lme-     be used this way?       Thompson (1979) suggests a dis-
course function for the pronoun *W9- (Slave be-lme-).        He points out that
a function of this pronoun in Athapaskan is to indicate an unstated object
when the subject is a nonidentical third person and the object a topic or
focus of the discourse. When a subject is nonhuman (or nonagentive), the
object is discourse topic, be-lme-   marks that the object is discourse topic.28.1.1.4               ?ede-lde-
  The reflexive pronoun marks direct (25) or oblique (26) objects that are
coreferential to the subject. It also indicates the possessor of an object
noun when that possessor is third person coreferential to the subject (27).(25)    ga?edenetf                             's/he teaches    him/herself   (Bl)        ?

24.5.2       Nonaspectual      prefixes  There are a large number of prefixes that occur in position 9 of the verb
complex but are not semantically aspectual in nature.      Unlike the aspect
prefixes, they are not conjugation choosers.    Unlike the thematic prefixes,
they occur in only some of the bases formed on a particular verb theme.
   Some of these prefixes are derivational and others mark gender classes.
These nonaspectual prefixes have only a few forms: they are generally of
the form de-, ne-, or   ye-/e-.
   Some of these prefixes are very productive, occurring in numerous
bases.   Others are quite limited in distribution.  The semantic content of
some of the can be identified but for others the meaning is opaque.24.5.2.1     de-24.5.2.1.1 de- (Hr, Bl, Sl)/<?- (Mt) 'benefactive, for oneself

        cf. -ts'äindi            Ί helped'This prefix ni- is unstable in terms of its position in the verb complex,
wavering between an incorporated stem (position 4) and a position 9
prefix. This instability can be seen in two ways. First, ni- may follow the
deictic pronouns, as in (162), suggesting that it is a position 9 prefix.
However, it may also precede the deictic pronouns, as in (165), suggesting
that it is a position 4 prefix.(165)   na?enigedhe                   'they   think'In (165), the prefix ?eni- precedes the human plural number prefix ge-.
It is thus unstable in position.
   The second factor that points to instability in the position of ni- is that
ni- may precede a /d/ initial prefix. There is a hierarchy in Slave that
requires that [d] precede [n] and [n] precede [r] in the position 8 and 9
prefixes. See chapter 5 for discussion. However, as examples (161) and
(164) show, this prefix can precede a /d/ initial prefix.
   The prefix ni-/?eni-   appears to be slipping rightward.      It most likely
originated as an incorporated noun. It is now moving towards becoming a
position 9 prefix, but is at this time still unstable in position. It is often,
but not always, the case that ?eni-      is an incorporated stem and ni- a
position 9 prefix.24.5.2.2.2 ne-    water
  This prefix ne- occurs in several bases concerning water or washing.(166)    ?edek'ena?enadi         's/he washed him/herself      (Bl)(167)   tehneehtse               Ί rubbed (hide) in water' (SI)24.5.2.2.3 ne-

On the first line a singular form is shown and on the second line a dual

  It is possible that this is the same morpheme as u- conative, discussed
in section 24.5.1.5 since they are similar in meaning.        However, u-
conative is aspectual and conjugation-determining while this prefix is not.24.5.2.5     che-       tease  This prefix occurs with the verb theme 'go.'(179)      secheda                      's/he is teasing me (without words' (Bl)(180)      sechjda                      'you sg. are teasing me' (Bl)It wavers between disjunct and conjunct position.      It is conjunct with
respect to the second person singular, as shown in (180). However, the
deictic pronouns usually follow it, suggesting that it is a disjunct prefix.
An example showing this is given in (181).(181)      secheket'ä                   'they two tease me' (Bl)This prefix follows the incorporated stems, as in (182).(182)      sedacheda                    's/he teases me, talking' (Bl)

these examples, it is not clear where in the sentence this relative pronoun
is placed. It is sentence-initial if there is no stated double role noun, as in
(98). Further data suggest that it follows the double role noun when there
is one stated. This can be seen in (99). However, in this sentence it is not
clear if the noun is in the matrix or the embedded sentence. In (105), the
noun is clearly in the embedded sentence and it is followed by t'aa.
                                                                            Relative Clauses   1325(105)   t s ' e l j t'aa   hjhchii s j i            'the girl he married' (SI)
        girl               3 tookIf the double role noun 'girl' were in the higher sentence, the fourth per-
son pronoun ye- would be present on the lower verb 'take.'
  The pronoun t'aa occurs as a relative pronoun, as indicated in the exam-
ples above.   It can also function as a bound morpheme in simplex sen-
tences, where it is a noun. Some examples of this use of t'aa are given in
(106) through (110).    While t'aa is used as a relative pronoun most fre-
quently in Slavey, it occurs as a bound form elsewhere.(106)   t'asίi                                      'something'

It appears to be unspeci-
fied rather than indefinite as it is assumed that a referent exists; this ref-
erent is unspecified rather than unknown.    This contrast is shown in the
pairs in (111) and (112).(111)   a. ?amii           ?eghälauhndä e n j d h f s j i ? e d j t l ' e k y e   näotla

is found only in bound form. It appears to be unspecified, yet with defi-
nite reference.
   In dialects other than Slavey, the question words are sometimes used as
relative pronouns. They can occur with a lexical double role noun, just as
t'aa can. Examples are given in (113) and (114).

2.4        Language   Status   While each community is unique with regard to the use of the Slave
language, there are a few general patterns.         Some communities are
basically monolingual Slave and some are mixed Slave-English.
   There are a few Slave communities that are basically monolingual
Slave. In these communities, all children enter school fluent in Slave and
many children have little or no English on entering school. Slave is
definitely the preferred language in everyday communication.           The
communities of Fort Franklin and Colville Lake fall in this category.
   The majority of Slave communities can best be characterized as mixed
Slave-English.    In these communities, most adults are bilingual and many
children enter school speaking both Slave and English or with at least a
passive competence in one and active competence in the other.          The
communities differ considerably as to where they fall within this wide
range.    For instance, in Fort Good Hope, Wrigley, Fort Liard, and Fort
Norman, most children have passive competence in Slave and many speak
the language.     In Fort Simpson far fewer children speak or understand
Slave when they enter school.
                                                   The Slave Language    15   Based on the criterion of language ability on entering school, Hay River
and Fort Providence are best characterized as monolingual English. Many
adults in these communities speak Slave, but few children do.
   In Table 2, a summary of the status of Slave in some of the
communities is given. The information given in this table is accurate as
of 1983. Έ' abbreviates English and 'S' Slave. The terms all, most, some,
and few following the language name indicate roughly the percentage of
people using a particular language. In all communities, both English and
Slave are spoken by adults.","[58, 59]"

30.4    Coreference                       and   conjoined       structures  In section 30.3, it was shown that in conjoined structures a noun and
pronoun can be interpreted as coreferential when the noun precedes the
pronoun (5, 6). If the pronoun precedes, the sentences are ungrammati-
cal, as in (35) and (36).(35)   *nadehtlah gots'g t'eere ?ehkee     k'e       ?aja

             *'I know himi and that man/s brother'  A qualification is needed on the rule of noncoreferential interpretation
to block a coreferential interpretation for (35) and (36). Rule (23) allows
for a coreferential interpretation in all four of the structures in (37) since
in all cases there is no command relationship.(37)   i.            S                     u.     S

and (37iii), it is not in (37iv), as (35) and (36) illustrate. In order to block
a coreferential reading in (37iv), a condition must be added to (23), mod-
ifying it to read as in (38).

         N P 2 are noncoreferential. 4

initial topic position.  These postpositional phrases are base generated
following the subject. The postpositions of interest are given in (39).         '-tl'a                                         'after' (Hr)

                          The   Meanings of      'want'  The verb bases u-de-0-li      (Hare) and ye-ne-{0, h}-when (other dialects,
Bearlake form) are translated into English in a variety of ways.       These
include 'want,' 'think,' 'hope,' and 'believe.' These different meanings are
distinguished primarily by the mode found in the complement sentence.
45.1    'want'   When these verbs are interpreted as 'want,' the optative mode is found
in the complement.     This mode is used for unrealized actions that are
intentions or desires. See the chapter for numerous examples.
45.2     'think,   believe'  Other modes can be found in the complement of these verbs. When this
is the case, the interpretation of the verb is usually 'think' or believe.'
The main verb expresses belief rather than intention.         While intention
contexts are considered to be unrealized, as shown by the optative in the
complement, belief contexts are considered to be in real time. The mode
in the complement is consistent with the time of action of the complement
verb. The perfective mode is used if the action in the belief context is
completed ((1) through (3)) and imperfective is used if it is ongoing ((4)
through (13)).   The imperfective plus the future clitic gha is used for a
future action with immediate relevance except in the Hare dialect, where
optative is used. In all dialects, optative is used for unrealized futures.","[1336, 1337]"
"13.4.1.4 Double possessive pronouns
  To indicate secondary possession, a double possessive pronoun is used.
228    Part III.    CategoriesIn the double possessive construction, an object originally possessed by
one animate being has come into the possession of another.           This is
indicated in the examples in (85) through (88). In these examples, in the
(a) forms, a singly possessed form is shown. In the (b) forms, the doubly
possessed form is given. Finally, in the (c) forms, the possessive form
with just the first person singular possessive pronoun se- is given.(85) a. ?ekwf                'meat (moose, caribou)' (Bl)
     b. se ? ekwf            'my moose, caribou meat' (Bl)

     b. sah bewe             'bear's skin (skin in the bear's possession)'13.4.1.5 The inalienable possessive construction
  An inalienably possessed noun is inflected for possession even when a
nominal possessor occurs.   Several examples are given in (89) through
(94). The possessive construction is bracketed.(89)     [chja bekw'ene]     led a we    'the bird's wing is broken' (Bl)

usually inflected for possession when there is a nominal possessor. 7 This
is shown in the examples in (100) through (102).          The possessive
constructions are bracketed.(100)      [?ama    ts'ere]      laidi   'where is mom's blanket?' (Bl)

in (103) and (104).»(103)          Mary hayi John he  kukge      'Mary and John's house' (Hr)

the possessive pronouns or with a nominal possessor. Some examples are
given in (105) through (107).(105)      tsäwedechin6                'stretcher for fur' (Bl)

it is not already on the second noun of the compound.(108)       sgda                               'glasses'
            sesgdaa                           'my glasses'(109)       tehtl'uh                          'net string'

  Deverbal nominalizations are generally possessed by using the
possessive construction with a possessive pronoun prefix or noun and the
possessive suffix. 9 Examples are given in (111) through (115).(111)       satsone na?enedlu             'sewing machine' (SI)

         semet'äh goyü k'ea ? etsii 'my toothbrush'The instrumental nominale such as those in (113) through (115) may also
be possessed using the postposition -ts'§ 'to.' This postposition is inflected
for person and the possessive suffix is not used. Some examples are given
in (116) and (117). The possessed nominalized form is bracketed.

           l s g . b r o t h e r cat      3.young (SI)  An alternative way of forming possessives is with the postposition -ts'p,
as shown in the sentences in (116) and (117).            With instrumental
nominalizations, the postposition precedes the noun, as above. With other
nouns, it may follow, as in (122) and (123).(122)      s§ba sets'f                        'my money, it's my money1
           money(123)      ts'ah bets'?                       'his/her hat, it's his/her hat'
           hatThis construction with the postposition following the noun is commonly
used as an independent sentence, as the glosses indicate. This can be seen
by contrasting the examples in (124) and (125).(124)      sets'f bet'ä yu k'ena?enetsi    'my washing machine' (Bl)
                                        ?

assimilate to the vowel of this verb, as shown in (126).(126)       sets'f ?9t'e                      'it is mine'
            sets'g ?9t'e13.4.5     Summary  In constructions indicating inalienable possession, the noun is
obligatorily inflected for possession whether or not a nominal possessor is
present.    This contrasts with alienable possession where the pronoun is
not present.     Compounds and deverbal nouns are generally marked for
possession with the possessive pronouns and the possessive suffix. The
possessor always precedes the possessed noun. Possession is a recursive
process, leading to complex construction such as that shown in (127),
which has the structure given in (128).(127)       t'eere ben?      belege    ngdaya b e y a

              'Joe and Robert went hunting'In (50) and (51), -hi is functioning as a postposition, while in (52) and
(53) it is a conjunction. The main evidence for this claim comes from verb
agreement.     In (50) and (51), the verb themes given require singular
subjects. The verb theme in (53) requires a dual subject. In addition, the
verbs in (52) and (53) show plural number agreement. If the subjects in
(52) and (53) are interpreted as conjoined, then this plural agreement is
accounted for.
  Word order also suggests this reanalysis of postpositions into two cate-
gories.    Postpositional phrases are base generated following the subject.
Most postpositional phrases remain in this position. This is true of both
phrases with simple objects and those with sentential objects. See chapter
42. However, the apparent postpositional phrases discussed in this section
more commonly precede the subject. This is the position one would ex-
pect to find them in if they are not postpositional phrases, but one con-
junct of a conjoined structure.
  This suggests that sentences like (42) and (44) do not have the struc-
tures shown in (43) and (45) respectively, but that the structure given in
(54) is appropriate. 6

                    S CONJUNCTIONSIn other words, these postpositions also fall in the lexical category of con-
junction.   The lack of coreferentiality between the pronoun and noun in
sentences like (48) is accounted for by the noncoreference rule.         These
morphemes may also be analyzed as postpositions (although less common-
ly), as in (49), as shown by the fact that a coreferential reading is possible.
  Two structures are thus available.       There may be a postpositional
phrase in topic position and coreference between a pronoun and a follow-
ing noun is allowed or there may be a conjoined structure and coreference
is prohibited.
  The move towards reanalysis of some postpositions as conjunctions also
and the tendency to prefer the noun before the pronoun work together to
make coreferential readings of sentences such as (48) highly marked.","[1090, 1091]"
"

noun precedes the pronoun, with the exception of sentences such as (1),
(5), and (6), discussed in section 30.2.  It accounts for the following
examples.",[1081]
