"15.1.1 Cases marked by -nd. The marker -nd is not phonologically stressed
and is written as a bound form. It marks the subject in transitive and
ditransitive clauses (except when only a short form personal pronoun is
used as subject). It thus functions as a morphological ergative marker, since
nontransitive subjects, like direct objects in transitive clauses, are never
marked. The same form -n6é also marks the superordinate subject in stative,
intransitive,      and   semitransitive   clauses.         The    subordinate      subject     is   marked
by kai.
   The suffix -n6 also marks the instrument or means                               constituent      in the
clause types mentioned below (sect. 15.1.1.3).
                                                                                                                        Sanuma     121
15.1.1.1    The     marker            -no        for       transitive            and    ditransitive                subjects.     The
marker -né must occur on a transitive and ditransitive subject except in the
case    of short         form        personal          pronouns             (61-63).           For        special     ordering      of

subjects in nontransitive clauses. As mentioned in sect. 1.1 there is a
comitative construction in which there is a leader-follower relationship. The
subordinate participant is marked by kai, which in rare instances has been
found to occur without the noun or pronoun it is marking (469). Though
much less common, inanimate objects can be marked by kai (468).
   The superordinate participant, which does not need to be expressed
overtly (28), is marked by the agent marker -nd, except in cases where the
short form plural personal pronoun constitutes the superordinate subject
and is marked by deletion of the final -k6 (466, 468). It might be argued
that kai functions          as a transitivizer, so that -ndé in this case would                                          simply be
functioning as an ergative marker in a transitive clause.

            ‘I am stingy because of (thinking of) the porcupine-man.’15.1.2     Cases    marked     by niha/ha.           A    wide       semantic      range      of oblique
constituents       is marked    by     one     of two        forms:      ha,     usually     referring   ‘©
inanimate objects and animals, and niha, usually referring to humans.
Objects or animals closely associated with or possessed by humans, such as
sai ‘house’ can take either ha or niha (see (334), in which it is the people
rather than the house which is emphasized), and in stories in which animals
act like humans, the marker niha is used.
      In those instances where         nihamé/hamé               are used       (usually     with motion
verbs), the contrast may be seen in a rough translation ‘toward, along, in
the vicinity of (niham6, hamé) as against ‘to, at, in’ (niha/ha).
      In normal speech the h drops. Also the i often drops in nia leaving ""4
as a common alternate form of niha. Thus the alternate forms are:            niha/nia/na
            nihamd/niamé
            hala
            ham6é/amé      These markers are used for the peripheral location constitutent (28, 29,
83, 84, 86, 103, 104), and for a comitative construction which sometimes
substitutes for one in which the subordinate participant marker kai can
occur (45, 46, 163).
  The form niha also marks             the ‘referent’            constituent,    including    specialized
functions in existence clauses (sect. 1.1.1.2) and comparison phrases (sect.
7.1.1).
   Here, the discussion focuses on the use of niha/nihamé/ha/ham6 in
marking cases or roles of three nuclear constituents: noninstigational agent,
instrument, and goal.

indicate what in a broad sense can be labeled ‘goal’. The meanings differ
in accordance with the type of clause in which they are found. These
markers are discussed and exemplified in the section on emotion clauses
(sect. 1.1.1.5, examples 36-40), activity clauses (sect. 1.1.4.1, examples
49-53),     motion         clauses       (sect.     1.1.4.2, examples     55, 57, 59), and       ditransitive
clauses where the niha/ha can indicate source as well as goal, depending on
the verb used (sect. 1.1.6, examples 77, 80, 81).","[106, 107, 108, 109, 110, 111, 112]"

nihafha     or      nihamdé/hamd,         indicating      some       point   of     reference,        usually   the
destination, in connection with motion along a trajectory. There is a
potential use of an instrument marked by ham6 with some motion verbs in
which the instrument is restricted to means of travel, whether canoe, motor,
foot, etc. In (59) it is the phrase ‘by motor’ which is highlighted. The hamé
used with ‘Mucajai River’ marks a goal constituent.(55)         waika      tépé_      sai        po          ha     a

an obligatory object which is usually expressed overtly, but can be omitted
under certain conditions (sects. 3.1.2 and 3.1.3). Another distinguishing
feature of both these clauses is that the subject is the agent of that which
is expressed in the verb, and is marked by -nd (except in the case of short
form personal pronoun subjects—see                        sect. 15.1.1.1).
                                                                                                                  Sanuma   29
   When a long form personal pronoun is used in expressing the subject
and when there is a noun along with its classifier expressing the object, the
subject and object are interlocking and discontinuous as in the example:(60)       kamisamak6                      -n6       hama =              sama                           t6p6

           ‘We     will hit the visitors.’  As     the     context     permits,         there        can      be      deletion        of the      elements       given
above,    and     the order        of deletion            is from        left to right:(61)       kamisamak6             -n6         hama_         sama                     t6p6       se _    kite

           3:PL      hit     FUT
           ‘(We) will hit them.’(65)       se   kite
           hit  FUT
           ‘(We) will hit (them).’  The above discussion gives the normal options for the occurrence of the
elements in the subject and object of transitive and ditransitive clauses,
although        the case     in which         the object is deleted                   in (65)       is rare.      (See sect.
3.1.2 for further discussion and examples.)
  Transitive       clauses        differ     from         ditransitive          in   that    they      do   not    have    an
obligatory       referent     as     goal,         which      is present             in the     ditransitive        clauses.
Transitive clauses are divided into experience and operation clauses.
30     Borgman1.1.5.1    Experience             clauses.       Experience          clauses     describe     an   emotional   or
perceptional experience on the part of the participant. In these clauses the
object is unaffected in that there is no physical contact or change that
takes place in the object as a result of the activity. Structurally, the absence
of a potential instrument in the experience clauses distinguishes them from
the operation clauses. This is the general rule, although we have found one
example (72) which is an exception to the rule. Other speakers did not
accept this construction and rephrased it.
   Following are examples of clauses describing an emotional experience:(66)        ki       moko                        te           -né6 = masulu_pi

            ‘Those people always dislike me.’     Clauses       describing        a     perceptional             experience     are      exemplified   by   the
following:(68)        kanene           sa           te          tad

           ‘We merely threw it away just now.’1.1.6 Ditransitive clauses. Ditransitive clauses are thus named because of
the obligatory goal or source constituent along with the obligatory object.
The constituents are usually overtly expressed, but may be omitted under
certain conditions. (See sect. 3.1.2 for object.) If the goal or source is
understood from context, or not considered an important item to express, it
may be omitted by the speaker.
32     Borgman     In these clauses there is a transference of position of the object, and this
is expressed by a transfer verb in the predicate. The goal or source is
marked by ha or niha. The constituent receiving prominence appears first
in the linear ordering.
   These clauses may be divided semantically on the basis of whether the
verb     indicates      a     release        or   a     reception.        In    the   first     case,   the    object     is
transfered from subject to goal.(77)        ipa       hao          -nd-       hama         te            niha

"16.1 Classifier pronouns.                          Each     noun      has a      classifier which cooccurs with, or
substitutes           for,        the       noun      in the        noun      phrase.      There      are   four      types   of
classifiers: specific, general, characteristic, and body part. The first three
types have a singular, dual, and plural form. Dual and plural are relative
terms. Dual can mean ‘few’ as well as ‘two’, and plural at times signifies
‘two’ as well as ‘more than two’ or ‘many’.
   With some nouns the dual is rarely used, only the plural: sai pd ‘two or
more houses’ and sanédma tép6 ‘two or more Sanumas or people’. With
other nouns the plural is rarely used, only the dual: ilo kdk6é ‘red howler
monkeys’ and ékoma k6k6 ‘bananas’.
   Specific, general, and characteristic classifier pronouns are translated as
‘he,    she,       it, they’.           Specific      and    general       do      not    correlate      with   the    definite
and indefinite categories of reference as they might appear to from the
English glosses with ‘the, my, etc.’ (definite) and ‘a’ (indefinite). (See
examples 566 and 572.)

16.1.1 Specific classifier pronouns. The              specific classifiers a ‘singular’, kéké
or the contracted form kd ‘dual’, and po ‘plural’ occur with nouns which
are used in a specific sense,          such     as    common               objects,    animals,     heavenly
bodies, and proper names.(566)   sai         a

sense, and include uncommon         objects, nominalizations, mass nouns, a
collective group of spirits or people, or one belonging to such a group such
as a female, a non-Indian, or a Brazilian.(572)   sii thoto                -k6   = ha_hoko                      te

         my   older:brother GNRL:3:PL
         ‘They are my older brothers.’16.1.3 Characteristic classifier pronouns. The characteristic classifers classify
the noun by indicating some general property of the noun: 6s6 ‘thin, of
little thickness’, koko ‘root’, thoto ‘rope, string, vine’, and ma ‘hard fruit,
rock’. (See also 464, 484, 510.) There are only about 15 characteristic
classifiers, with a limited number of nouns which go with each one.                         With
some, aS di in isa dai ‘cassava bread’, there is only one noun in the                       class;
with others, such as ds6 ‘thin thing’, there are many nouns in the class.
Some nouns may take only the characteristic classifier, while others may
take another type of classifier as well, as in the examples of sitipa kdkd
(metal SPECFC:3:DL)              ‘coins’   and   sitipa   na-k6   (metal   CLASS(leaf)-DL)
‘bills of money’.
  The dual form of the characteristic pronouns                    takes the contracted form
ké of the specific classifier (586) and the plural form takes the specific
classifier plural pd (589). These dual and plural forms are written as bound
to the classifiers inasmuch as no other element can intervene.

with human and animal body parts. This classifier is different from the
others in that it precedes the noun and in that it has no dual or plural
forms, and usually the noun to which it refers does not take the dual or
plural either. There is a case of a dual form in pili mamo-k6                                                      ‘eyes’, but

modifier pewéo ‘all, both’ is used, as in (590).

"       Sanuma Donald   M. Borgman
Missao Evangélica da Amazonia
                                                    IntroductionSanuma is spoken by approximately 2,000 people, about 500 in Brazil on
the Auaris River and its tributaries, and the rest in Venezuela, on the
upper Matacuni, Ventuari, Caura, and Erebato along with their tributaries.
   Phonetically, the name of the tribe is /sanima], with stress on the first
syllable. In publications for readers other than the Sanuma themselves, we
have chosen to use u for the second vowel while some in Venezuela (e.g.,
Lizot 1975) have used e.
  The Sanuma are basically monolingual, with a very few speaking also the
language of the neighboring Carib group, Yekuana         (Maiongong or
Madguiritare).
   Sanuma is one of the languages or dialects of the Yanomami language
family. The same language family has been called ‘Yanoama’ (Biocca 1971;
Ramos      1972;        and        Taylor     1972,   who    cites     Becher     1960,        and    Wilbert     1963)
and      ‘Yanomamo’                (Chagnon         1968).   In      Venezuela      the        term     ‘Yanomamo’
appears,     probably               an   orthographical           variation     of ‘Yanomamd’.             Migliazza
(1972)     suggested           the term        ‘Yanomama’,           “. . . as this term             is not found       in
exactly this spelling in any dialect, but is understood by the great majority
of speakers . . . and it will not be confused with any dialectical groups.”
   We adopt here, however, the designation ‘Yanomami,’ which has been in
use since about 1975 in Brazil by the National Indian Foundation (FUNAIT)
and journalists.
   Some autodenominations for other Yanomami dialects are: ‘Yanomam’
(upper Uraricuera, Parima, and Toototobi Rivers in Brazil); ‘Yanomamd’
(upper Orinoco and tributaries in Venezuela, with some groups over the
border in Brazil); and ‘Ninam’ or ‘Yanam’ (upper Mucajaf and Uraricaa
Rivers in Brazil).
  The same groups have received other designations by those outside their
own group:
  ‘Shrishana’           is    used       by   the     Yekuana        (Maiongong)          in     reference       to    all
Yanomami.          On        the    Catrimani,        Demini,      Mucajai    and    Uraricaad         Rivers,    there
are groups designated as ‘Shirishana’ or ‘Shiriana’ by other Yanomami,                                                and
there are some on the Mucajaif and Uraricaa who use one of these terms
when     presenting themselves to outsiders.
  ‘Waica’ is a term used by Yanomami (at least in Brazil) referring to the
people who speak the Yanomam dialect.
  ‘Shamatari’ is a term used by the Sanuma in referring to those of the
Yanomam6 dialect                    (see also Barker 1979). The Yanomam                               people of the
Uraricuera do the                   same, but include the Sanuma in this                              designation of
‘Shamatari’.

                          Syntax of the Sentence or Clause1 Word            orderThe subject precedes the verb (or other predicate). In clauses which have
an     object,     the    ordering       is subject,     object.       Elements        such     as   instrument       or
goal precede the subject in stative and intransitive clauses, but in transitive
and ditransitive clauses these elements precede the subject only if they are
given prominence over the subject. Otherwise they follow the subject and
precede       the object.        The      ordering just described               applies        to subordinate         as
well as to independent clauses. There are cases in which the speaker may
tack     on what         we    consider      to be a fragmentary                sentence        consisting        of the
clarifying        constituent,       which         may   be      any    of     the     nuclear       or     peripheral

sentences rather than constituents of the main clause because they fit in
with the general               intonation of sentences,                and because             these constituents
occur elsewhere                as complete utterances                  in responses            to the questions
20    Borgman‘Who?’,      ‘Where?’,        ‘With   what?’,     ‘To      whom?’,     etc.     Also   it   should   be
mentioned          that this type of phenomenon                 in examples       1-5 is rare. In a
collection      of Sanuma       myths,   narratives,      and   conversation,      there    are only 8
fragmentary sentences of this nature versus 2,500 sentences with the same
constituents in their normal ordering.
  The ordering of constituents will be amply exemplified and elaborated
upon in the following discussion. The main discussion centers around the
basic     clause     types,    with   a section         following    treating     of the    peripheral
constituents in the clause.","[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]"

there is usually a change of roles of the participants in any basic clause
which becomes a derived clause, thus far this change has been linked to a
marker within the verb. There remain some derived description and
operation transitive clauses in which there is no marker within the verb; it
is the     change          of     the        semantic         roles         of the             participants              which        is the
dominant feature of the derivational process.

Certain verbs which are basically transitive can function as derived stative
verbs. The object-as-patient of the transitive clause becomes            the
subject-as-statant of the stative clause, and the subject-agent of the
transitive clause is omitted.     In    (821-824),   all   derived   stative   clauses,   the
verbs are basically transitive.(821)    kutiata   a      6ka    ma        kule
         canoe     3:SG   tie    NEG       PRES

         CLASS:wood       open    PRES
         ‘The door is open.’   Similarly, there is a subclass of basically stative position verbs which do
not take the causative marker -ma or any other derivational affix, but can
function as derived transitive verbs through the change of subject-as-statant
to that of object-as-patient and the introduction of a subject agent. The
change focus marker -ki/-kd in the verb does not in itself change the basic
verb to a derived one, but this marker always occurs in the derived form.
(See sect. 18.2.5 for explanation of static and dynamic forms of the verb.)(825a)   Basic position verb (static form, without -ki/-ké):

             ‘(He) laid the tapir (on the ground).’   Some description verbs can become derived operation transitive verbs
either through the use of the causative marker -ma or through the
derivational process under consideration. In the latter case usually -pa or
-ta ‘extent of action’ is added to the verb phrase. The choice of whether to
use the causative -ma or the extent of action -pa/-ta depends upon whether
the prominence is on the resultant state (with -ma) or on the action itself,
as in ‘Make it tight’ versus ‘Tighten it’. (See exs. 156-158.)18.6 Direction, location, and clarification. There are direction and location
indicators within the verb phrase; they follow extent of action and change
focus markers and precede the tense-degree of knowlege-location and
degree of fulfillment markers. In a given verb phrase there can be
direction,     location,    or a combination        of both       when     the    directional   is -ima
‘approaching’ (186, 831, 832).
      The   clarification      marker    also   follows    the        change     focus   markers    and
precedes the tense-degree of knowledge-location markers.","[184, 185, 186, 187, 188]"

internal head and is followed by an anaphor in the main clause that is
coreferential with the internal head. This anaphor consists of a relative
pronoun i followed by a classifier pronoun that agrees with the person and
number       of the internal head.                      Either the relative or the classifier may be
omitted, but they often co-occur. In (522), the relative clause is ipa ulu
koko lo-le, the internal head is ipa ulu kék6, and the coreferential anaphor
is i k6ko.(522)    ipa     ulu       k6k6é         lo          -le,           i

         ‘My sons who are sitting here will not go.’  This   relative        clause     construction                   has    some       of     the    characteristics      of a
correlative, especially the type that Keenan                                      (1985:165) refers to as coming
close to being simply a “left-dislocated internal RC”. There are, however,
some distinctive features about the Sanuma relative clause construction and
some of these differ depending on whether the relative clause has a
nondescription verb (15.3.2.1) or a description verb (15.3.2.2).
134     Borgman
15.3.2.1 The relative clause with a nondescription verb. The marker for the
relative clause with a nondescription verb is: one of the indefinite markers
(wi, noai) (sect. 14.1.1); one of the witnessed markers (sect. 18.1.1) with
ku- deleted (e.g. -le, -e, -pi, -pili, -li, etc.); or the specifier hai. The latter is
used in identification clauses and can also be considered as part of a
possessive        construction          which    has been       discussed        and     exemplified   in sect.
15.2.
  The relative pronoun i ‘the referred to’ follows the relative clause, usually
contiguously, but other elements such as time and location may intervene,
as in (533). Phonologically, there is a pause after the relative clause when
the relative i is used.
      The   i may         be    omitted,        usually    when      the     indefinite      marker    of the
restrictive clause is wi. In this case the construction sometimes approaches
the meaning of a compound noun (536, 537) or, when the coreferential
anaphor is the third person general pronoun te without a noun, the
construction may be used to name an object, usually foreign to Sanuma
culture (538-540).
   The head of the relative clause consists of a noun plus its classifier
pronoun, or just the classifier pronoun if the noun is already known from
context (525, 528, 534).
      The   head    of the        relative      clause    may     have     one    of several     grammatical
functions in the main                 clause.   In the examples          shown,        it has the function of
subject (522, 528, 533, 535), object (523, 526, 527), non-direct object (524,
525), and time or location (541, 542).
      Within the relative clause itself, the head                          may    function     as intransitive
subject (522-527), object (533, 534), or non-direct object (535). When the
relativized constituent is the subject-agent of a transitive relative clause,
there is no internal head noun phrase or classifier. The subject-agent is
signalled only in the indefinite marker wi that occurs at the end of the
relative clause (530-532, and compare the use of wi as a_ general
nominalization marker in sect. 15.4).(523)       ipa     ulu        k6k6é     lo     -le,       i         sa

            ‘I intend   to play with (others) at the place where they always play.’15.3.2.2     The     relative     clause        with     a     description            verb      or        the         nonaspectual
existence verb. The marker for the relative clause with a description verb is
the     indefinite    -i, which        is a bound             form      affixed        to     the     verb;            this   verb     is
either     a description        verb       or    the         existence       verb      that         does         not      have       the
durative aspect -a or punctiliar -o. (See sect. 20, where the indefinite -i
functions as an adverbializer on certain description verbs as lope ‘fast’ and
pe epo ‘very big, forceful’.) When the verb to which the -i is affixed ends
in -6, the -6 becomes -i. Some Sanuma speakers put a slight glottal stop
between       this -i and the indefinite -i while the majority do not (543-546,
548, 555-557).
   The main clause grammatical function of the head of this type of relative
clause may be subject (546, 548, 555, 556), object (545, 549-554),
non-direct object (544), or head of a locative, but not a temporal, clause
(547, 557).        Within     the relative clause, the head                         is always        subject.
   There are some respects in which the relative clauses with a description
verb differ from those with the nonaspectual existence verb. Constructions
with description verbs will be considered first.
   In contrast to the relative clauses described in the last section, those with
a description verb often have the head noun following the relative clause,
either instead of (545, 548, 549, 553, 554), or in addition to (550-552),
being internal to it. In these cases, the relative pronoun 7 is optional, but
the suffix -i ‘INDEF’            always         occurs on the verb in the relative clause.(543)       ipa      hoose                       a             pata           lape_         epi                       -i,

          ‘Give me my long, red machetes.’   In relative clauses with a description verb                                     or verbs and a descriptive
modifier of the noun, the description verb                                         comes first, receives more
emphasis, and also has the indefinite -i.(553)     ape       -i                   ipa         po              k6k6         hanaha          pi            -ta

          3:DL_ red      give -EXT
          ‘Give me my new, two red machetes.’   In contrast with the description verbs just described, relative clauses with
the nonaspectual existence verb (the verb without the durative -a or
punctiliar -o) have an internal head, and usually only the classifier pronoun
occurs as the coreferential anaphor in the main clause, although the head
noun phrase may be repeated (557). This is the same as for relative
clauses   with      nondescription                   verbs.      The        relative      marker,             however,      is    -i
‘INDEF’, the same as for description verb clauses.
  The existence verb is ku- ‘to be’ with one of the following suffixes before
the relative -i: the nonaspectual -6 or the present -le. With -le it is common
for the ku- to change to ki-, and with the ki- the -le most commonly
changes to -li, with the resultant form kili-i. (See exs. 90-93 for the possible
variant forms.)

marked by the clause-final subordinator wi ‘INDEF’ (sect. 14.1.1). This is
followed always by the third person singular general pronoun te. The
relative ¢ may occur, preceding the te. Structurally, a nominalization is much
like the relative construction, the indefinite clause being comparable to the
relative clause. One difference is that the relative clause always has a noun
or pronoun as head, whereas the head of the indefinite clause in a
nominalization may have only a verb. This might be expected inasmuch as
a     nominalization                focuses         on         the        verb           itself,         whereas          a     relative        clause
focuses on a clause constituent other than the verb. Another difference is
that the indefinite clause of a nominalization is always followed by the third
person singular general pronoun te, whereas the relative clause may be
followed by other pronouns or nouns.

"14.5.1 The quote tag clause. The verbs generally used in the quote tag
clause are ku ‘to say’ or pi ku ‘to think’. These are intransitive verbs. Of
approximately 1,350 entries of quote tag clauses in text material, there were
1,330 entries in which these verbs occurred. There were only 20
occurrences of two other verbs used in quote tag clauses: the first is the
compound     verb    noa    tha    ‘to order,        urge,    direct,    retort’     (which          comes        from
the noun ‘payment, return’ and the verb ‘do, make’); the second is the verb
tha-ma ‘to be prompted or forced to say’ (lit., ‘to be caused to do’). These
verbs are transitive, with subject and object occurring in the quote tag
110     Borgmanclause, as in (438-440). (For Sanuma readers the following scheme for
quotation marks is used: the citation is marked at the beginning and end by
the dash [—], the embedded citation is marked by quotation marks [“ ”],
and the citation embedded in an already embedded citation is marked by
the single quotation mark [‘’]. In the English translation, single quotes are
used for the whole free translation as usual, double quotes [‘”] are used
for the citation, single quotes [‘’] for a citation within a citation, and
double quotes again for a citation within a citation which is embedded in
another citation.)(436)       —      hukii            maké                 k6             -a

intransitive, (2) the manner phrase i naha ‘like that’ introduces, or
potentially introduces, the quote tag, and (3) there is already an object
expressed in the quote tag when the verb is the transitive noa tha ‘to
order, urge’ or tha-ma ‘to prompt to say’, the citation clause is not
considered to have the function of direct object, but rather is considered to
be a complement to the quote tag clause. It should be noted that even
though it is labeled as ‘complement’, the citation clause may appear without
the quote tag clause, if the context makes it clear that the clause is indeed
a citation, and if the identity of the person making the quote is also clear.
This is the case in dialogue, for example, where there is a rapid exchange
of speakers with fairly short quotations.(444)      —        a         wani = hithani                    —

14.6 Multiple subordinate clauses. In one sentence there may be a                                                   series
of juxtaposed subordinate clauses preceding the main clause. Up to four is
common. There are many examples of eight subordinate clauses, and there
are 12 in (451).
   When several subordinate clauses occur, most of them are sequential
clauses with the sequential markers nd or ha. Generally, as has been
pointed out, né indicates that the subject of the following clause will be the
same as that of the sequential clause of which it is a marker. The
sequential ha indicates that there will be a change of subject in the next
clause. This is well illustrated in (451).
                                                                                                               Sanuma_         115
  When    subordinate          clauses precede                 other subordinate             clauses, the markers
or relators at the end of each subordinate clause relate that clause to the
subordinate clause immediately following, not to one further on, and not to
the main clause. The only exception to this is with the use of the contrary
to expectation maaki             ‘even though’, which                      has been found to relate to a
clause not contiguous, as in (449).(448)    ki       hamé         dla          a                wani     = -nd,

         ‘Are you all about to go?’  Short form first and second person singular pronoun subjects are never
marked   except    by     word          order.        In     transitive    and   ditransitive   clauses,   they,
along with all the other personal pronouns, follow the object noun and
precede the classifier of the object noun phrase (61-63).
   The first and second person plural short form pronoun subjects are
marked   in the transitive and                  ditransitive, not by a marker               as such, but by
the deletion of the final -kd. Compare                              the subject pronouns        in (456) and
(457) with those in (458) and (459).

            ‘Did you all test them?’      (See sect.    15.1.1   for the 3rd person             pronoun     subjects    in transitive and
ditransitive constructions; these are marked                     by -nd.)
   The object in transitive and ditransitive constructions is always unmarked
morphologically, and occurs before the verb and after the subject except
when the subject is a short form first or second person pronoun. In this
case the object is discontinuous, with the classifier or pronoun following the
subject short form pronoun, but with the noun preceding it (60).
   There is an instance in which the object assimilates phonologically into
the subject. This takes place when the object is the third person singular 4
‘he, she, it’ and occurs without          the noun           it classifies, and     when      the subject
is only the short form first or second person pronoun.                        If one of these short
form pronouns is singular, then only context can determine                                   whether the
personal pronoun is object, or subject with assimilated object.(460)       wa                               ta       -la          like

            ‘Did (someone) see you?’ or ‘Did you see it?’  The preceding has treated of unmarked subject and object, and the
reduction which takes place in first and second person short form pronouns
when used as subject of transitive and ditransitive verbs. There now follows
a discussion of subject and other cases which receive a marker.","[95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106]"
"18.8     Auxiliary             and      compound                  verbs.        The     existence        stative       verb      in     a
subordinate merged clause could be considered an auxiliary verb. (See sect.
14.4.2, exs. 427-431.)
   There are some verb heads which are compound in that they have two
elements, and these are separated in the linear ordering by the adjective in
a noun phrase, by the categorizer of the noun phrase (pata, wai, wani), and
by the prehead adverbs moni, mani, hole. (See sect. 15.3.1.3, exs. 512, 513,
515-517, and sect. 18.7.1.) The fact that the prehead adverb is not mutually
exclusive        with      Vb.          Head            1 of the       compound                verb     is one      criterion         for
setting up a distinction between them and treating them as two different
classes. Other distinctions are seen in studying the make-up of the
compound          verb.
      Although      there            might         be     more,       the       following        are    the    common          words
making         up Vb.          Head          1: hama           ‘visit’ (335, 848), wasimé /wasumé/wasémé
‘en masse’ (512), mamo ‘with eye’ (52, 849), séméka ‘with ear’ (446),
namo/namo ‘with intent to kill, harm, or destroy’ (360, 537, 642), nasi
‘having to do with termination of life, whether human or plant’ (513, 515,
516, 850), nasé ‘follow after immediately’ (851), and pi ‘inside’ (38, 45, 212,
336-338, 341, 478, 555). Some of these elements in Vb. Head 1 are from
the     noun     class         (e.g.,    hama            ‘visitor’,    mamo           ‘eye’,    somdka        ‘ear’,   nas6é     ‘nail,
claw’); others are from descriptive verbs (nasi ‘bitter’, namo ‘sharp’).
208   Borgman   In contrast to the prehead adverbs, the constituents of Vb. Head 1, with
the exception of pi ‘inside’, are followed by a very limited number of verbs
(about 20, mostly intransitive). Our data show only one Vb. Head 2
possibility for séméka ‘ear’ (which is ta ‘see’), two possibilities for nasi
‘bitter’, and three for mamo ‘eye’. A few motion verbs such as hu ‘go’, eku
‘cross over’, a- ‘leave’, and walo         ‘arrive’ may     constitute      Vb.    Head   2 for Vb.
Head 1 hama ‘visit’ and wasimé ‘en masse’. In addition to some of these
motion verbs, the verbs simé ‘send’, himé ‘point’, and kuse ‘untie’ are verbs
that can be included in Vb. Head 2 when Head 1 is namo/namo. With
nasé there can occur either the intransitives hu ‘go’ and hd ‘trip’ or the
transitives te/su ‘take’.
   Unlike the other examples of Vb. Head 1, pi ‘inside’ occurs with many
verbs, most of them description and emotion verbs, along with the very
common        verb kuu ‘say’. pi is included here as Head                1 of a compound verb
rather than as a prehead adverb because other prehead adverbs can occur
with pi (517) and because pi plus the verb acts as a unit and in at least
some cases may occur as a post-head adverb (45). (See sect. 19.3 for pi
used as a locative adjective.)
   Head 1 plus Head 2 of the compound verb often can be translated by
one verb in English (e.g., hama hu ‘visitor go’ or ‘visit’, and pi kuu ‘inside
say’ or ‘think’).(848a)    i         nasa              hama hu     -ké        -ma

"16.5.1 Grammatical relationships of the relative pronoun i. As discussed in
sect. 15.3.2.1, the relative i often refers back to an immediately preceding
relative clause. This relative pronoun also can refer to an element beyond
the     sentence    in which           it occurs.            Usually,             the       reference               is to    an     element
preceding, although               in     (611)          the          i        refers        to         participants           yet    to     be
enumerated.
   The relative i may refer to a single constituent of a clause (the second /
in 609), a whole clause (a main clause in 610, or a subordinate clause as in
the examples of sect. 15.3.2), or even a whole sequence of clauses (as does
the first ¢ in 609).

16.5.2 Grammatical           function of the relative 716.5.2.1 The relative i as modifier. The relative i can function as a modifier
of the noun or pronoun of the main clause and is mutually exclusive with

along with 522-527.)

18 Verb phrase structureThe class of verb occurring as head of the verb phrase correlates with the
clause type in which it occurs, except in the one case in which the
existence verb occurs as head of an identification clause. Thus, in
description clauses there are description verbs, in motion clauses, motion
verbs, etc. Each class of verb, therefore, is basic to one clause type. It is
possible, however, for a verb to occur in a clause type other than its basic
one. The verb phrase in such a case is a derived verb phrase. For
example, a transitive verb occurring in a stative clause is a derived stative
verb. (See sect. 18.5 which deals with derivation.)
   The verb phrase may be analyzed in terms of nuclear and peripheral
constituents. The peripheral constituents are adverbs and function to modify
the head. A maximum of four have been found in any one verb phrase. In
general, there are fewer in stative type verb phrases than in others. The
broad      meaning     of    the    classes   of   adverbs     are:     time,    location,   manner,
co-occurrence in relation to other participants, sequence in relation to other
actions, and limitation of action. This is also the usual order in which the
adverbs occur within the verb phrase. The adverbs are discussed in sect.
18.7.
   The nuclear constituents are the head and combinations of constituents
indicating durative, punctiliar, iterative, and repetitive aspects, extent of
action,    continuation,      change     focus,    negation,     direction,     location,    a   single
category     with    the    three   components       of tense,        degree    of knowledge       and
location, and degree of fulfillment.
   Following is a list showing the linear occurrence of these constituents in
the verb phrase. Top to bottom in the vertical arrangement represents what
would be left to right in a horizontal one.","[149, 150]"
"4.1.1 The direct reflexive. In the direct reflexive, the subject acts upon itself.
Even though semantically the referent is agent as well as recipient of the
action, only one argument is specified —the subject, and this does not take
the agent        marker         -nd. The      subject could             be plural,     but the singular is far
more common.
   The receptive verb marked by -so ‘change focus’ and the adverb kd/ko
‘return, again’ are used in the direct reflexive, but these features in
themselves do not mark reflexivity. Along with these features there must be
either the adverb sapa ‘turn around and go back’, or the long form of the
personal pronoun,               or both. If the subject is a noun, or if the short form of
the pronoun is used, the adverb sapa normally occurs.(131)      atakusa          a           -nd              kama _ nia             sapa

itself to be acted upon and the verb phrase includes the suffix -mo
‘causative reflexive’ which has other functions when used with nontransitive
verbs or with nouns (sect. 18.5.1). It should be noted that the nonreflexive
causative is -ma.(139)     sa     se   -mo            ta6—s   mii

          ‘They cause themselves to be provided for (by asking for goods).’  There    are    some         verbs     in        which     the       causative   feature   is   not    dominant,
even though the causative marker -ma or the causative reflexive -mo is
used. The glosses in English help to see this: ‘feed’ for ‘cause to eat’,
‘show’ for ‘cause to see’ (168), and ‘bathe’ for ‘cause to wash’. In Sanuma,
these verbs with the causative reflexive marker -mo have the subject acting
upon itself as in the direct reflexive.(144)     kama     ia          sapa                   -mo

          ‘Did you already bathe?’4.2 Reciprocals. The reciprocal is expressed by the reciprocal suffix -so,
which is distinct from the -so ‘change focus’ used with the receptive verb in
the reflexive construction. One evidence of this distinction is that the
reciprocal -so may occur with the ‘present tense witnessed’ and also with
the negative, whereas the -so ‘change focus’ may not. (See ex. 135
compared with exs. 134 and 136.) The adverb kd/ko ‘return’ in the
reciprocal construction has a different function than                                        in    the    reflexive
construction, as seen by the translation ‘again’ (148).

5 PassivesThere are two constructions that could be construed as passives. One is the
receptive         clause         (150),     the    verb     of which       is derived      from a    transitive        verb
through          the   use       of the         receptive        marker    -so, which      is one    of the     change
focus    markers             and      is mutually           exclusive      with      the   change    focus     markers
-li/-l6, -ki/-ké, and -pifp6 (sects. 18.2.5.1 and 18.5.2.1). In this construction
there can be no agent in the receptive clause—only instrument. It should
be noted that receptive clauses with verbs which are not derived from
transitive verbs (151) clearly are not passives (see also sect. 18.5.2.1, exs.
810-815).
   The other construction which might be considered passive is the
transitive        construction              in which        there      is ellipsis    of   the   subject     (152a).      If
these constructions were taken to be passives, then there                                             would       be     no
active constructions in Sanuma. (See sects. 3.1.1 and 3.1.3.)(150a)       a             se       -pa           -SO            -ma

6 CausativesThere      are       four    types        of     causatives:           direct,        indirect,          reflexive,          and     the
quasi-causative.","[29, 30, 31, 32, 33]"
"20.3 Manner adverb and phrases. There is only one manner adverb which
is not incorporated in the verb, naha ‘like’, and while it can be used alone
(215, 216), it is usually used in a phrase or after the indefinite wi in a
comparative construction (400-403). In a phrase, naha is usually used in
conjunction            with the relative i ‘the referred                   to’ (205,          210,      333),       or with the
interrogative wi (230-237).
                                                                                                               Sanuma     211
  The     subordinate           clause        marked          by   kai,     which     is merged         into    the     main
clause,   could     be         considered        an        adverbial        construction        expressing        manner.
(See sect.     14.4.1, exs. 412-415               and sect.          15.3.1.3, exs. 519-521.)
  There      are a few description verbs which are adverbial in meaning, such
as lope      ‘fast’, opi ‘slow (84, 85, 451), and others which can be used
adverbially,      such         as wini/wani            ‘little’ (187, 852) and pe ‘big’ (853). Used
adverbially     all these         description              verbs   take     the indefinite           -i. Sometimes       the
use of -i is ambiguous                  with a         relative construction, as in (854). (Compare
sect. 15.3.2.2 for the use of -i in relative clauses.)(852)     wini = ipi                         -i               sa          ha     -palo

21 Particles21.1 Sentence particles. The interrogative                                         and        negative            particles        are
discussed in sects. 10 and 12 respectively.
  There       is a particle                  a/ha      which         follows   the          noun     phrase             and     which
precedes the verb and indicates that the subject or object is not seen, but
heard (labeled ‘auditive’) or heard about (labeled ‘hearsay’). (For auditive,
see 212, 360, 384, 387, 415, 443, 446, 447, 517, 561, 643, 667, 796; for
hearsay,     see        662,    674,        717,     762;    some       of these       are       ambiguous.)             Following
the third person singular pronoun fe, usually the                                             particle       a replaces            the
vowel e of the pronoun (212, 855).
   This particle can occur with the noun phrase                                               when         the      verb        is not
present, as in the following example.(855)        awai, i         ta
            yes      REL     3:SG:AUD
            “Yes, (it is) that (talk).’21.2 Discourse particles. The relative i functions as a discourse particle
when it refers back to an element beyond the sentence in which it is
found. This has been discussed in sect. 16.5.1 (609-611).
   The discourse particle or clitic under discussion here is -ka. As
mentioned          in      sect.     9.1,      the     clitic    -ka     affixed       to     the    subordinate                clause
markers draws attention to the fact that the event, state or identified item
contained in this subordinate clause is highlighted as being part of the main
theme. Some of the subordinate clause markers followed by -ka thus far
exemplified         are:       the     sequential           nd      ‘having’   (106,        446,    449,         450,    708,     748,
784b,      792b),        ha        ‘upon’      (450),        kuteend       ‘being        that’      (389),         maaki         ‘even
though’ (392), and salo ‘because’ (749). This clitic may also highlight
various clause constituents such as agent (108, 118, 119), instrument (122),
and adverbial constructions                         (104,    186,      199, 201, 377, 434, 541, 647).
   The use of -ka also signals the fact that the main clause that follows is
also part of the main theme and deserves special attention. The clitic -ka
does not occur in the setting at the beginning of a narrative, in the
explanation or summary at the end, or in flashbacks (see texts in the
Appendix).
                                                                                                                     Sanuma        213
   The example below is taken from a narrative telling about a close call
with a snake in the forest at night. The setting of the narrative consists of
four main clauses and                  eleven subordinate clauses. Then, for the first time,
the clitic -ka appears                 on two subordinate clauses followed by two other
subordinate clauses without the clitic. Ten subordinate clauses precede the
next subordinate clause with -ka. The rest of the narrative has 18 more
subordinate         clauses         before     the      next     occurrence              of     -ka,         which     is     on     a
locational phrase             containing        the        important         fact      that      the         speaker        arrives
safely home.
   Phonologically, phrases with the clitic -ka do not have the rising final
intonation that they would have otherwise. There is a glottal stop after the
clitic, followed by a          slight pause.(856)                 sa        pili       -a           pai      -a                  to         -ka,

21.3 Verification particles and interjections
21.3.1 Verification particles. Following is a fairly complete list (all those the
meaning of which is relatively certain) of the particles which show the
speaker’s         emotion,     or     his relation         to, or subjective                 evaluation         of, the       state
or event in the utterance.
214     Borgman   The confirmative -kd/-ki is used in both the interrogative as well as the
declarative and is used to ask for or give confirmation (127, 148, 205, 210,
214, 215, 258, 298, 345, 365-367).                    Other      verification particles such as o and
a may follow the confirmative -k6/-ki (875, 877.)
      The   desiderative sa expresses a wish that a certain state or event were
actuality in present time.(857)       ipa sokopi a       ku -o                                 sa

            ‘If only the airplane would come.’      The   stimulative      particle     sé     indicates        that     the     situation    expressed     is
accompanied         by    the    stimulation          of   the       speaker’s        emotion   in   either     a
pleasant or unpleasant way.(859)       old      k6k6        -n6      sa           namo.         ke          -a

These consist of a single vowel, sometimes preceded by aspiration. When
an immediately preceding vowel is -6, this -6 is most commonly dropped
(872, 873).
   The particle a ‘VERIF’                       indicates surprise, or a circumstance                 outside the

h, m, n, |, w.
  The plosives are p, ¢, k, th. p, t, k are voiceless plosives at the bilabial,
alveolar, and velar points of articulation: paso [paso] ‘spider monkey’; tapu
[tapu] ‘fat’; kahi [kahi] or [kai] ‘mouth’. p, 4 k have voiced variants
intervocalically in which there is free fluctuation, the voiceless plosive being
the more common: ipa [ipa] or [iba] ‘my’; hute [hute] or [hude] ‘heavy’; aka
[aka] or [aga] ‘tongue’.
   t, word medially in fast speech, sometimes                            has the flapped liquid variant
[f] at the alveolar point of articulation: kutiata [kutiafa] or [kuriarfa] ‘canoe’.
  k,    beside     having     the        variant     [g],     occasionally         varies      with      [kh]    word
initially, and always has the variant [ky], a voiceless palatal plosive with
added palatalization release, when following i and preceding a: kahi [kahi],
[khahi], [kai], or [khai] ‘mouth, language’; konasé [konasi] or [khonasi] ‘a
black ant’; waika [waikya] ‘Waika’ (a large dialect group of Yanomami),
hikali [hikyali] ‘garden’; ikapalo [ikyapalo] ‘smile, laugh’.
   th is an aspirated alveolar plosive contrasting with                                        the      unaspirated
alveolar plosive ¢: tha [tha] ‘do’ vs. ta [ta] ‘see’; luthe [luthe] ‘moldy’ vs.
hute [hute] ‘heavy’.
   ts is a voiceless          alveolar        affricated       plosive      and     occurs      word       initial or
word medial. Word medially it has a voiced variant [dz], or occasionally [z]
in fast speach,         usually         in a word           with    more     than     two      syllables.       ts has
another variant, an alveopalatal affricated plosive [tS] or [dz], which occurs
contiguous to i, the [dz] freely fluctuating with [t8] intervocalically (see next
paragraph for the writing of ts as s): salaka                            [tsalaka] ‘fish’; hasa            [hatsa] or
{hadza] ‘deer’; masupé                 [matsupi],     [madzupi],           or [mazupi]         ‘toucan’; masulu
[matsulu],       [madzulu],       or     [mazulu]      ‘beads’;      sinimo        [tsinimo]         ‘corn’;    kamisa
[kamitSa],       [kamidza],    or      [kamiza]      ‘1:SG’.       Two     words    have     been       heard     from
some speakers in which [ts] varies with [tS] when it is not contiguous to [i]:
sami [tsami] or [tSami] ‘one, alone’; sopi [tsopi] or [tSopi] ‘hot’.
  There      has been some              discussion as to the interpretation                  and writing of ts
and s. Those          working          in dialects of Sanuma                north     of Brazil          relate that
there    is no ts in those             dialects.    Even      in Brazil,     the phonological             distinction
                                                                                                                            Sanuma      221
between [ts] and [s] is negligible and can best be heard in the environment
of i in which the alveolar plosives [t, d] or the voiced fricative [z] are
easily distinguished: kamisa [kamitSa], [kamidza] or [kamiza]; sai [sai] ‘house’
vs. sai [tsai] ‘really’, which in the environment of i are sami sai [tsami sai]
‘one   house’          vs.     sami      sai        [tsami      tSai]     ‘really      one’.       Because              of (1)         the
difficulty in distinguishing                    [ts] and            [s] in most        environments,                   (2) the        fact
that literate Brazilian Sanuma                              themselves had great difficulty in writing ts
vs. s, and (3) the desirabilty of uniformity in orthography for Sanuma                                                               both
in Brazil and           Venezuela,             we    have      disregarded            the distinction of ts and s in
the practical orthography and write only s.
  s is a voiceless              alveolar        fricative        having        an alveopalatal                variant         [8] when
occuring      contiguous             to i in the              same      word:       silaka       [Silaka]           ‘arrow’; mosili
[moSili]     ‘gnat’.        There     is at least one                 word     which      does         not     fit this analysis:
solosama [soloSama] ‘songthrush’.
  h is a nonsyllabic voiceless vocoid                                     occurring          word            initial        and      word
medial. The word-medial A is often lenis or sometimes drops out
completely: hasa [hatsa] or [hadza] ‘deer’; ohi [ohi] or [oi] ‘hungry’; waiha
[waiha]      or    [waia]           ‘later’.        (The       fact     that     there       are        cases          in     which       a
particle-initial         A drops out could indicate that these are part of a larger
phonological           word,     although            we      have     chosen      to interpret               them       as separate
grammatical words: a kuu ha [a kuu ha] or [a kuu a] ‘upon him saying’.)
  m, n are voiced nasals at the bilabial and alveolar points of articulation:
mamo [mamo] ‘eye’; nana [nana] ‘anatto’; manu [manu] ‘small variety of
curassow’.
  I is an alveolar lateral and occurs word initial or word medial. It is never
contiguous to a nasalized vowel (see sect. 22.4.8): laka [laka] ‘bamboo’; ala
[ala] ‘macaw’; holisi [holi8i] ‘fake’.
   w is a voiced bilabial nonsyllabic vocoid and occurs word initial or word
medial: wale [wale] ‘peccary’; iwathama [iwathama] ‘alligator’.","[196, 197, 198, 199, 200, 201, 202, 203, 204, 205, 206, 207]"

introduce information gradually, from general to specific, and while this is a
subject for discourse study, it enters here in relation to the consecutive
occurrence of the same peripheral constituent. In this case, the stating of
the general time or location is followed by the more                                 specific information,
and there is phonological dislocation.(102)   hena_       tehe,       motokd               hétuto        tehe,      tdpd

speaker      describes             an event by using an ideophone                           in place       of a regular
verb, or he may use a form of the verb in which all or most of the normal
affixes are dropped. This verb may be repeated to give the idea of
repeated or continuous action, or, if ideophones are used, there may be not
only repetition of the same                          ideophone,          but     the inclusion          of another     one
indicating       a different               action.      Not     so      common          is the     repetition        of an
adverbial modifier within the verb phrase followed by only verb affixes, as

3 EllipsisThere can be omission of both verbal and nonverbal constituents and also
of the main clause. In these cases, the omitted constituent is recoverable

(sect.   19.3).","[20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25]"

logical relationships are: condition, cause, intention, purpose, consequence,

and      locative relationships, relators marking a logical relationship also occur
clause final.
98    Borgman     Condition        is marked        by ha     ‘if, upon,      when’,       tehe     ‘if, when’     and     the
completive -ma. In this type of subordinate clause no tense-modality may
occur and the verb of the main clause is future tense. With -ma the verb
of the main clause may be present or future. In many instances, condition
is ambiguous with sequential action, also marked by ha.(378a)       i        t6p6 hu      ha,            a                          héla_     kite

the main clause and is simultaneous with the main verb. Since with nouns
kai signifies subordinate accompaniment (sects. 1.1 and 15.1.1.2) and is
labeled ‘subordinate participant’, the label given here for kai with a verb is
‘subordinate verb’.

subdivided on the basis of the syntactic function of the verb of the
subordinate clause, and labeled on the basis of the class of verb in the
main clause. These constructions may be abilitative, emotive, or stative.
  In the abilitative construction, the verb of the subordinate                                            clause takes on
the syntactic function of object of the main verb. The                                     main verb is always
tad ‘to know, to know how to’.(422)   sa         hiso        ta6         = mi

of the subordinate clause takes on the syntactic function of referent,
corresponding to the ‘referent’ niha with nouns that are used with the same
emotive verbs in constructions with no subordinate clause.(424)   wa     pili  -o         kili                           -i

            ‘Don’t have a strong desire to play around with another man.’   In the stative construction with a subordinate merged clause, the verb of

main verb. The main verb is an existence (copular) verb, either the positive
ku ‘to be’ or the negative ma ‘not to be’, and the negative is always in the
process form: ma-ta-so/ma-pa-so/ma-po ‘cease to be’. (See sect. 18.2.5.2 for

two clauses: the citation clause and the quote tag clause. Usually these

442). In these cases, the subject or indirect object is usually repeated after
the citation.
   The use of direct quotes is very extensive. In a collection of 4,000 lines
of recorded myths, narratives, and conversation, there                                   are     approximately
1,350 quotes.
  There is no indirect quote construction in Sanuma.","[91, 92, 93, 94, 95]"
"16.2.2 Usage of personal pronouns. The long form is used to give
prominence to the person involved. Usage of the long and short forms
varies with the type of clause in which they are found. Also usage is
restricted with the referent marker niha.
150     Borgman      a. With the marker niha only the long form is used.(592)       kamisa                  niha    a           toto     -k6

            ‘He is angry at you.’      b. In an identification clause, the short form is almost always used in the
interrogative and the long form is always used in the declarative.(594)       witi     wa

usual one, with the long form used only when the pronominal subject
receives prominence (601).(597)       sa       inamo    -ti               kule

           ‘I am not going.’  d. In transitive and ditransitive clauses, both the long and short forms for
the first and second person are used in the same clause. If there is no
Prominence given to the personal pronoun, only the short form appears
(61-63).
  The      long   and        short    forms      can     occur       contiguously            with   deletion   of the
object noun.(602)      kamak6o                     -né6         sma                       te     m6

pronoun, and this is the general rule, but there are some cases in which
the short form can take the agent marker, as when the numeral is used to
modify the pronoun (603) and when there is an appositional phrase (604).(603)      sami     sa              -nd = ipa_        te           uli = tai,      _~—stai

"1.1.1.1 Identification clauses. Identification clauses are characterized by an
obligatory subject, which is the identifying element, an obligatory
complement, which is the item or person to be identified, but which is
often not overtly expressed if the complement is clear from context, and a
copular verb, which occurs only when non-present tense is used. The
complement distinguishes this clause type from the other stative clauses.
   Following are examples given in the order of most common usage: with
subject only (6-9), with complement and subject (10-12), with subject and

showing emotion and by the obligatory occurrence of a referent in the
sense of goal marked by ha or niha. The nature of emotion verbs (fear,
sorrow, anger, happiness) makes a goal obligatory even though it is not
always overtly expressed.(36)   dla           a             pata   ha              sa        kili

describe a state which is the result of the subject being acted upon. Also,
the verbs of the receptive clauses are characterized by the change focus
marker -so.(41)    salaka  -n6d    pole  a      pata    -so                             -ma

on     the    part   of     the     subject.           Most    of   the     intransitive      verbs      have         the
performative         -mo     ‘to     act       like,     be   engaged      in’.    (See   sect.    18.5.1,      for     a

of their distinctive features of the obligatory goal constituent which indicates

of object or a transitive type verb.

With body parts, which are inalienably possessed, the short form personal
pronoun is used (usually in the singular) and precedes the possessed item.
In addition, the classifier pili may be employed preceding the personal
pronoun to emphasize the distinction of the body part in question from
other parts of the body.(498)       —      hi ka     pi                                  te   —

15.3 Modifiers in the noun phrase15.3.1 Constituents        of the noun           phrase. The          usual linear ordering of the
noun phrase constituents is as follows: demonstrative                            or relative, possessive,
additive, noun, classifier, adjective, categorizer, and specifier. The general or
specific classifiers (sect. 16.1) may precede the noun in a_ possessive
construction (sect. 15.2.2) or when the noun has already been introduced in
a narrative or conversation. (See (361), which is taken from a narrative
text, and (551, 552), obtained through elicitation.) The order of frequency
in the occurrence of the constituents is: classifier, categorizer, noun,
demonstrative, possessive, adjective, and specifier.","[113, 114, 115]"
"15.2.1 The personal possessive pronouns. There are only two possessive
pronouns, the first person singular ipa ‘my’ and the second person singular
au ‘your’. These immediately precede the possessed item.(486)       ipa sai                a

        your:SG father           3:SG
        ‘your father’15.2.2 Noun phrase or pronoun preceding possessed item. Possession is also
expressed by a noun phrase or a long form pronoun preceding the
possessed item. When possession is expressed in this way, usually the
specifier hai and the relative i follow the noun phrase or pronoun and
precede the possessed item. In this possessive construction, the singular
form of the classifier follows the possessed noun, unless more (or at least
equal) prominence is given to the possessor (492, 493).
   Though less common, the noun may precede the possessed item without
the specifier and relative (491). It may be that in these cases identification
rather than possession is signified.
   Although there is a possessive pronoun for the first and second person
singular and this is used most commonly, possession may also be expressed
by the regular long form first and second person pronouns. This probably
indicates that the possessor receives special emphasis.","[112, 113]"
"8.1 Coordination of sentences. The following example of the juxtaposition of
two sentences may be regarded as coordination. These are considered to
be sentences because of the final intonation in each. This is in contrast to
the     rising intonation          found    at the end          of each     clause,          except       the     final one,

            forest.’8.2 Coordination of clauses. Coordination on the clause level is
accomplished by the juxtaposition of clauses with the feature of rising
intonation on the final syllable of each clause except for the final one. The
rising intonation,          also present      in subordinate             clauses,       is indicated             by the use
of the comma.           (See sect. 21.2 for the exceptional case of falling intonation

accomplished by the use of the coordinational noun phrase. (See sect.
2.1.1.) Comitative constructions, such as the two group-forming devices
discussed in sects. 1.1 and 2.1.2, and the niha construction in (196), are not
regarded as examples of coordination.(196)      kau    niha sa      hu pi                               topa_        kule

9 Pragmatic           and       discourse                characteristics9.1 Main theme in discourse. The discourse clitic -ka is used in narrative
and occurs either at the end of the predicate of a subordinate clause or on
a nonverbal constituent of either a subordinate or main clause. At the end
of a subordinate clause, -ka indicates that the state or action   of this clause
is on the main theme line of the narrative discourse. With nonverbal
constituents such as subject, instrument, referent, time, or location, the clitic
-ka     indicates     that       the        particular           constituent        on   which         it    occurs   is
emphasized and is part of the main theme.
60   Borgman
  The use of -ka also signals the fact that the following main clause is part
of the main theme and should be given special attention. (See sect. 21.2 for
fuller discussion and illustration of this clitic.)9.2 Emphasis within a clause. There is a normal ordering of constituents
within a clause, but this ordering may be altered if one constituent receives
special emphasis. For example, the subject usually precedes the referent,
but the referent comes first if receiving the emphasis (77, 78). Time.
location, and manner constituents usually occur in that order, but location
may precede       time if receiving the emphasis.(197)     te           uli        paimo                 ha,        hi     wisa                  ha            a

         “Where it was grown-over he worked yesterday.’9.3 Introduction of information. Information usually flows from the general
to the specific. This is exemplified in the occurrence of peripheral
constituents such as temporal or locative: the general                                    time or place       is given
first, followed by the more specific information.(198)    hena_         tehe           motok6           hétu             -to       tehe,  tdpd

        ‘At the big rapids, right there where the non-Indians’ houses are, at
        the place where the motor lay, we kept sitting.’9.4 Introduction of a new episode. Once a discourse is in progress, one
common way of introducing a new episode or subject matter is by the use
of the clause i naha te ku-a tehe (REL like 3:SG be-DUR when) ‘when it
is/was like that’ or merely ku-a tehe (be-DUR when) ‘when it is/was’. In
the first instance there is the relative phrase i naha ‘like that’, but the
function of relating is secondary to that of indicating a new subject matter.
   Another way of opening an episode is by the use of the demonstratives
hi ‘this’ and ki ‘that’, with or without the locative postposition, and followed
by a pause. The following examples are excerpts of a message sent to the
speaker’s family. Each example opens a new subject.(202)   hi...     hukii,                  Poa      Pisita         ha     sa       ku         -a          kule

actor of the following clause will be either the same or different. The
sequential marker n6 (sect. 14.1.1) is used when the actor of the following
clause will be the same. The temporal conjunction ha is used when the
actor will be different. (See (361-364) with the paragraph preceding them
and the second paragraph of sect. 14.6 with (450, 451). (451) shows that
either the sequential nd or the temporal ha may be used after a question
in which it is evident that a different actor will give the reply.)9.6     Hesitation      forms.                 Two        hesitation       forms        which      are     common           are   the
demonstrative hi ‘this’ and the relative i ‘the referred to’. When used as
hesitation forms, the normal anaphoric function of these pronouns is either
secondary or nonexistent.

often stages scenes which took place in the distant past and presents them
as though present. In such cases, the present and the immediate past tenses
are used, and then in closing an episode the speaker often reverts to the

na-ké (REL like-CNFRM) ‘like that’ or slight variations of this phrase such
as the deletion of the relative i or the confirmative -k6/-ki or both. The
interjection pei ‘that’s it’ is also used to conclude a discourse as well as an
episode. Less common is the phrase dnd-k6 (like that-CNFRM) ‘that’s it’
(210) or the affirmative particle awai ‘yes’. More than one of these means
of closing may be used in the last utterances of a discourse.","[43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50]"

"18.7.1 Pre-head adverbs.            The three pre-head adverbs signify nonreality:
moni ‘almost’ (836, 837);           mani ‘in a dream’ (839, 840); and hole ‘falsely’
(841, 842). Like the first head of a compound verb head (sect. 18.8), these
pre-head adverbs precede the categorizer (wani, wai, pata) of the noun
phrase (837, 838). When modifying a compound verb head, the pre-head
adverbs occur between the first and second verb head (838).

following general categories: time, location, manner, co-occurrence in
relation       to   other     participants,           sequence          in relation      to    another      action,   and
aspects of an action. In general, the linear ordering of these adverbs is that
given above, with time occurring first and limitation of action last. Most of
the     adverbs      of time,       location,         and      manner,        as well as a few            of the others,
are derived from verb stems and become adverbs when they follow another
verb head. Following is a list of adverbs together with their categories. The
listing for time, location, and manner is only partial.
206     Borgman
   Some of the time adverbs are: hena- ‘early in the morning’ (199, 209),
halu- ‘during the night’ (623), tute- ‘first part of, and tole-/tolehe ‘latter part
of/further on’ (179).
   Some of the location adverbs are: tole-/tolehe ‘further on’ (371), pasdko-
‘further to side’, métalé- ‘in the middle’ and hisa- ‘at home/in                     house’ (172,
360).
   Some of the manner adverbs are: hai- ‘quickly’ (296, 317), sapa- ‘turning
back’ (134-137), toti- ‘good/well’ (160, 217), hasu- ‘passing by’ (182), nono-
‘upright’ (25), and kawese- ‘at the edge of’.
   The adverbs in the category of co-occurrence in relation to other
participants are: hei-/hi- ‘separating from/overtaking’ (110, 438), le- ‘coming
towards/meeting’ (357, 444), nani-/nai- ‘together with, also’ (45, 528), hété-
‘apart from, also, in return’ (174, 188, 190), pasi- ‘separate, in contrast to’
(27, 130, 191), and hato- ‘secretly, out of sight, maybe’ (450, 642).
   The adverbs showing a sequence in relation to another action are: soma-
‘first’ (355), pali-/pai- ‘before’ (371), ném6-/hémé-                   ‘next’ (362), and kd-/ko-
‘return/again’      (448, 643, 647).
   The adverbs which give some aspect of an action are: waiki- ‘already’
(145, 161, 211, 212), soa- ‘still/immediately’ (86, 192), pd- ‘merely’ (44, 138),
asa- ‘exclusively, advantageously’ (178, 181), and sisa- ‘only’ (437, 829).
   The adverb sai ‘really, exactly, inexorably, unalterably’ can also be an
adjective, and is different from the adverbs mentioned above in that it can
modify not only the head of the verb phrase, but also a temporal or
locational word (846, 847).(843)       kamisa_ pi         ku   upa        sai                       -a       kule

            ‘After a really long time I will return.’18.7.3 The intensifier dpd. Phonologically, the intensifier has the following
alternate forms: Ghépd, dpé, épd, Vpd. The first form is extremely rare; the
second is heard occasionally in emphatic speech. In the more common
forms, nazalization is dropped and the first vowel accommodates to
whatever vowel precedes it. Thus, there are examples of apé (104), epd
(33, 450), ipé (141, 162), upd (87, 447), and opé in kauko opé ‘very soft’.
  The intensifier 6p6 can occur with stems of verbs of description (33, 141,
178), emotion             (383), existence                   (18, 19, 570), and experience                         (66, 177, 184,
189); it also occurs with adverbs which are derived from description verbs
(104, 162, 184, 447).
   The intensifier can also occur after the performative -mo,                                                            after        the
repetitive talo/palo (304, 478), after -po ‘change focus’ (354),                                                         after        the
causative -ma (172), and after the negative (305, 306, 313).","[190, 191, 192, 193]"
"18.2.5.1 The usage of change focus with various verb types. The only
change focus option for the existence verb is -ki. The use of -so would put
the verb into the derived receptive verb class (sect. 18.5.2.1). Example
(761) speaks of change       in terms     of action    to be taken,     and   (762)   in terms
of a new location.
  Compounded        with verbs of another class, especially state and action, ku-
‘pe’ plus -ki indicates the beginning of a new state or action (763, 764).(761)    mi        na   mak6         ku -k6 = -pd

         ‘He just got so that he could crawl.’  The    change   focus   -ki rarely occurs        with description    and    emotion   verbs.
More often -so, denoting process, is employed, and the result is a derived
receptive verb. When -ki is used with description or emotion verbs, there is
always an adverb of time, location, or manner, or the intensifier -dpd.
Following are some of the few examples of -ki with description and
emotion verbs, along with contrasts with -so to clarify the meanings.(765a)   sa       amis    nini-—-a          halu         -ki

            ‘I became really angry at night.’  The usual option for the dynamic form of position verbs is -ki, an option
which is as frequent in occurrence as the static form (768, 769). The option
of -so is extremely rare. In the one example found, the mother has been
sitting for days with her new born baby. Finally, she comes to the time
when she is able to lie in the hammock with the baby. It is the process
leading up to the new position which is in view. Also of interest is the
comment by the Sanuma language helper that the -so could not be used if
the modifier -ko ‘return, again’ were not used (770).(768)      wa       pili    -a       ko       -ki

places where there are co-occurrence restrictions applying to change focus
markers with any verb class (sect. 18.2.5.2). There are rare instances in
which     -ki is used        with     receptive      verbs,            in which        case     the         focus    is on     the
time, place,       or manner           of change          rather than the process or change                                  itself

   With    intransitive and activity verbs -so gives prominence to the process
leading    up to or involved in the action and -ki gives prominence to the
beginning of a new action.(776)      tu         oki      -mo                sipa                           apo                  -SO           kite

            ‘The bottom part of the leaves (of booth) merely gets worn away.’   Motion verbs can take either -so or -ki as the change focus markers.
With this class of verb -so focuses on departure whereas -ki focuses on
destination. Certain motion verbs such as ‘leave’ and ‘flee’, because of the
meaning of their stems, only take -so, the focus on departure. In the
majority of cases, when the focus -so occurs with motion verbs, so does the
directional -l6 ‘away from’ (779, 780). Other verbs such as ‘arrive’ and ‘fall
to the ground’ only take -ki, the focus on destination (781, 782). Other
verbs such as ‘fall’ and ‘go’ can take either focus (783, 784).
   With the verb kd/ko ‘return’, the change focus -pi is used when speaking
of returning to home base—a person’s place of residence, or the residence
where he has been visiting for a long period of time, so that he considers
it his temporary home (785). The existence verb ku ‘be’ can be used with
the verb ké/ko ‘return’, which in turn can have the marker -pi (786).(779) _ tiko      ham6 wa    wai     a      -su---16._—s pia_—salo

        (This verb a- ‘leave’ never occurs without the focus -so and with

that it is the        action        itself which          is given             prominence.        -so focuses    on     the
reception       or   receptor       of the         action,         and     the    result   with    transitive   verbs     is
to change them to derived receptive verbs (sect. 18.5.2.1). -li focuses both
on the initiator and the receptor; -ki on the initiator or initiation of the
action; and -pi on a specific or final goal or base toward which the action
takes place.         By ‘base’       is meant            the final destination or place or person of
prominence, depending on the verb used. As seen already, for ké ‘return’
the base is home (785, 786a). This is true also for -pi when used with si-
                                                                          fire’

markers. The change focus markers -so, -ki, -li and -pi cannot occur with
the present tense, with a negative, or with a temporal clause with the
temporal marker tehe. Exceptions                     to the temporal clause restriction are -pi
which    becomes        -po    in the       temporal        clause,    and      -so   which    becomes         -to or
-po when preceded by the extent of action aspects -ta and -pa in the
temporal clause.
   -ki/-li/-pi_ become -k6/-ld/-p6 when followed in the same clause by a
syllable the vowel            of which      is other than i (1, 190, 241, 291, 292, 686, 761,
788, 789b, 792b, 797), except in the case in which the following morpheme
is a witnessed marker (56, 212, 410).
   With imperatives, -ki/-li become -kd/-l6 (154b,                            156-158,      744a,     789a).

   In the imperative and sequential constructions, -so becomes -lo (261b,
362). (The verb root a- ‘leave’ never occurs without the change focus
-so/-lo and only in this verb the -so becomes -su and -lo becomes -lu (89,
90, 115, 116).) Also in imperative and sequential constructions, -pi becomes
-po with the motion verb ko ‘return’ (264b), and it sometimes becomes -pa

   The modality of degree of knowlege is included with the tense marker
(sect. 18.1). This section discusses the degree of fulfillment modality which
includes         complete     fulfillment, possible  fulfillment,  desired  fulfillment,
intended         fulfillment, indefinite or incomplete fulfillment, settled fulfillment,
and      hypothetical          fulfillment.      Some      of     these    categories        might    better     be
considered         as aspects      (e.g., complete,         indefinite,     and    settled    state), but      they
are included in this section because they occur in the same position in the
verb phrase as the other modalities described here and are mutually
exclusive with them.","[173, 174, 175, 176, 177, 178, 179, 180, 181]"

causative         is less common than the indirect in transitive clauses.                               In direct
causative          transitive clauses, the action of the noninstigational                                agent is
overshadowed by that of the instigational agent or subject. The subject is
marked by the agentive -n6é and the noninstigational agent is marked by
niha. (Example (167) with noninstigational agent was heard only once. The
construction in (173) seems to be much                             more      common.)

occurring on the verb toto                      ‘to give’ and the resultant meaning with the
causative is ‘to provide’.(170)     po             a         -nd           ulu_—      topo

the extent aspect markers -pa or -ta are employed. The construction is
means-oriented in that the action involves either some means (even though
unintentional, as in 172) or a noninstigational agent. The means or agent
are not always made explicit.

           the instrument indirectly used by the subject to act upon the

some way, the marker -mo is used, not the regular causative marker -ma.
(See sect. 4.1.2 for fuller explanation and examples.)6.4 Quasi-causatives.             There       is a special         usage      of the causative          -ma   with

linked with the action rather than with the patient or object. This usage
might be called a quasi-causative, which is difficult to translate in terms of
cause. (While the object is stated in (177a), it is not affected to the same
degree as the object in (177b). This, together with the fact that (177a) is
more easily translated without the causal element, argues for its inclusion as
a quasi-causative.)(175a)   sate       -ma

"12.1 The negatives as verb stems. The negatives may be used as stative
verbs. Ma is a negative existence (copular) verb, while mi, structurally, fits
in with the descriptive verbs and indicates ‘zero, none’ in terms of numbers
or quantity.(302)       kutiata   a     ma      -ne

verb, it is difficult to define a semantic difference between the negatives
82    Borgman
ma and mi, but there are restrictions as to which aspects and markers may
occur with each.
     In general,    the      negative            modifiers              immediately            precede         the verb-final
aspect markers, with other verb affixes preceding the negative. There are
rare cases where ma and mi seem to form part of the verb stem or at
least be so closely united to the verb head that other modifiers follow the
negative instead of preceding it. In these cases, the affixes following the
negative modify the verb plus the negative and not just the verb. The only
examples we have of these cases are with the verb tad ‘to know’.(304)      sa       te            taé          so ma_—sshai                    -a              -talo

to the durative or punctiliar aspects unless the change focus markers occur.

not yet taken place (future or negative); or that a state as a whole is being
contrasted with another state (705b). In contrast to all other verb types

         ‘A tapir lies on the ground. A piping guan perches.’  Existence      verbs,        unlike     others,      contrast        between         durative       and   punctiliar
with the completive.             Durative with the completive indicates a summary of
events which took place over a period of time (707, 708). Punctiliar with
the completive, as in other verbs, pictures the event or state as a whole or
as one point in time (709). Nonaspectual is ambiguous with durative
because the form can be identical and the semantic distinction is arbitrary
(710).

            a. ‘My sister is (sSomewhere).’ (Durative.)
            b. ‘My sister exists’ or ‘I have a sister.’ (Customary)   The use of -a and -o with intransitive and semitransitive verbs is more
complicated than with other verbs. Intransitive and semitransitive verbs can
be divided into two classes: one class has the durative -a or the punctiliar
-o on the stem when followed contiguously by the completive -ma or by the
tense-degree of knowledge marker, whereas the other class does not. This
second class may or may not have the iterative aspect marked by -a or -o.
The iterative may be durative (marked by -a) or punctiliar (marked by -o).
The durative iterative occurs with the repetitive aspect (716). The punctiliar
iterative occurs with the change focus -ki and needs more verification to
determine if this is actually an iterative aspect.

  The nonaspectual or customary marker for verbs (except for the stative
and receptive verbs) is -6. When       following a high vowel, the -6
accommodates to that vowel, so that following a stem ending in -i, the -6
becomes -i and following a stem ending in -u, the -6 becomes -u (70, 721,
725).

         intended, then the durative -a would be used.)(714)    setenapi            topd       pi       hasu           -O

         example. The modifier k6 again is durative or progressive and
         therefore        takes    the -a. In terms of immediate               constituents, we could
         say that the ‘passing by’ is punctiliar, but that the ‘passing by again’
         is durative.)

            ‘He fell in right in the very middle.’   (2) Polysyllabic stems (87) and modifiers (728) which end in -a never
add -o; the performative -mo and the repetitive -talo/-palo never add the
suffix -a (45, 737).(728)       a       ku      -o               hisa          -ma

478, 650).
   (4) In a purpose              construction,      the suffix -a occurs                on     the verb head
which takes the purpose marker. (See sect. 14.4.1.) The only exception to
this is when -o occurs on the existence verb in the main clause. In this
case, the verb which expresses purpose also takes -o (731).(729) _ pii     ni       su -a      -m6                          a       -su-                -16—s ke

with present tense, negative, and the tehe time clause), -o instead of the
change focus -ki is used to express the initiation of a new state or action.

182     Borgman18.2.2 Repetitive aspect. The repetitive indicates either that one agent is
engaged in an activity which involves repetitive action or movement
(running, working, saying over and over), or that several agents are
together engaged in the same activity (talking, eating). The repetitive differs
from repetition indicated by the modifier k6é ‘return, again’ in that the latter
indicates repetition after an interval.
   There are intransitive and transitive forms of the repetitive aspect. The
intransitive forms are -talo and -palo, with the difference corresponding to
the difference in -ta and -la explained in sect. 18.2.3. -talo indicates rapidity
or mental activity whereas -palo indicates force or physical activity. -talo
and -palo are not to be confused with alternate forms of the extent of
action and change focus sequences -ta-so and -pa-so, which are -ta-lo and
-pa-lo (743a, b).
   The     transitive    forms     for     the      repetitive         are        -tala   and    -pala      (739, 740a,

an aspect labeled          ‘extent of action’.                Each        marker        has a variety of meanings,
and      context     should       decide        the        one       which        is appropriate               in any          given
occurrence. The possible meanings for -ta are ‘rapid, a mental act,
ingressive, sudden, with temporary result’; for -la the possibilities are
‘pradual, repetitive, progressive, distributed, with semipermanent result’; and
for     -pa    the   possibilities      are         ‘forceful,       at    once,        a    physical        act,    conclusive,
final, with permanent result’.
      Contrast in meaning of the three markers is seen especially in (742-747).
As to their position in the verb phrase, they precede the post-head adverbs
(748, 749) except with the occurrence of the change focus (-so, -ki, -li, -pi),
in which case the                 extent        of        action         markers            immediately            follow      these

dynamic form has one of four change focus markers: -so, -ki, -li, or -pi. The
general meanings are as follows. (More specific meanings will be given in
connection with the various verb types.) The -so indicates a process leading
to a new state or action and is the prominent marker for receptive verbs.
The -ki indicates initiation of a new action, state, or experience, and is
found predominantly with intransitive and semitransitive verbs. The -li
occurs only with transitive and ditransitive verbs and indicates goal focus
                                                                                  Sanuma_   187
and the finalization of an experience or the reception of an action. The -pi
focuses on the location of an action and is limited to the idea of important
bases such as the home,          hearth, or head of a person.         This marker     does not
occur with stative and receptive verbs.
   The first section deals with the usage of the change focus with various
verb types and the second gives the restrictions and morphophonemic
alternates for the change focus markers.","[159, 160, 161, 162, 163, 164, 165, 166, 167, 168, 169, 170, 171, 172, 173]"
"15.3.1.1 Nuclear constituents of the noun                       phrase. The nucleus of the noun
phrase    comprises      noun    and     classifier.     The      noun      is often    absent    if context
makes clear what the referent is. Although the categorizer is optional and
in the periphery of the phrase, it is often present—more so than the noun.
(There are only three categorizers: the augmentative pata ‘big, important’,
the diminutive wai ‘small, endeared’, and the depreciatory wani ‘ugly,
depreciated,       nondescript’.)      Considering        the     nucleus     and    the categorizer,      the

sect. 18.7.1), the first head or the prehead adverb occur between the

occurs after the classifier and the prehead adverb follows the first head and
adjective, but precedes the categorizer (515).","[115, 116, 117]"
"22.4.5 Glottal stop. As mentioned above (sect. 22.4.4), the glottal stop may
occur between identical vowels. Subordinate clauses end with glottalization
only with the use of the discourse clitic -ka (sect. 22.3). There is free
fluctuation between glottalization and nonglottalization before an utterance
beginning with a vowel. An interrogative never has an utterance-final glottal
stop, whereas the declarative usually does.

            ‘Did he come just now?’   Some instances of nonglottalization utterance final in the declarative are
with the use of: ideophones (sect. 24), certain verification particles and
interjections (e.g., 0, a, la, and u/hu in sect. 21.3), a noun by itself (paluli
(It’s a) curassow.’), and verbs without their normal affixes (sect. 2.3 and
examples).22.4.6     [i] and [u]. In word-initial                position,     [u] is interpreted            as w when
there is is no stress on the [u]. When                      there is stress on word-initial [ul], it
is interpreted         as the    vowel     u    and    it constitutes      a syllable:      wé     ‘basket’    vs.
u.6 ‘intimate’. In that [i] in word-intial position always                          receives stress, it is
interpreted as i and constitues a syllable: ia ‘eat’; ie ‘blood’.
  In word-medial position following another vowel and preceding 4
consonant, [i] and [u] are interpreted as vowels inasmuch as there are no
nonambiguous consonant clusters word medially: aulu ‘wounded, sick’.
haikamo topo ‘ants’.
  Word medially when occurring intervocalically, [u] is interpreted as w in
the absence          of a nonambiguous                series of three vowels          in a grammatical
root: iwathamo ‘alligator’; asawds6é ‘broken off’; pewo ‘all’.
   i does not appear intervocalically in the word-medial                              position        with    the
exception       of two      loan words,        teia te ‘bottle’ and huia          te ‘harpoon’.       In these
cases     we      still prefer   to   interpret        [i] as    a vowel      because       this    is a rare
occurrence          and     because      of the        inconvenience         of    introducing         another
phoneme y.
      In word-final position, [i] and [u] are interpreted as vowels because of
the ruling        out of CVC          as one       of the       syllable   patterns      (sect.    22.4.1     and
examples).","[209, 210]"

the form in which the question was made. Thus, in hapoka wa naka ma ke
‘You didn’t ask for a cooking pot?’, if the response to this negative
question is awai ‘yes’, it means ‘Yes, I did not ask for a cooking pot.’
11 ImperativesThe     regular    imperative     construction     is marked      by   certain   morphological
restrictions and modifications in the verb, by the absence of nouns in the
subject, by the restriction of the personal pronouns, by stress considerations,
and by a special negative imperative form. Imperatives cannot occur with
descriptive stative verbs.
   Degree of peremptoriness in the imperative is indicated by stress, the
more peremptory shown by stress on the final syllable of the verb, and the
lesser by stress on the penultimate.
   Beside    the regular imperative, there are three imperative-like
constructions: hortative, implorative, and negative.",[59]
"10.1 Content (question-word) questions. Content questions are indicated by
the use of the following basic interrogative words: witi ‘which? what? who?’;
ka ‘what?’; and wi ‘how?’, which is always followed by the manner relator
naha/na ‘like’ with the resultant literal gloss ‘like how?’ Witi naha/na ‘like
what?’ can also be translated ‘how?’. Time and location are indicated by

the addition of the time and location particles to witi and wi naha: witi ha
‘where?’ and wi naha . . . tehe ‘when?’.
   Information asked for by means of question words may be concerning a
person, a thing or activity, number, manner, time, location, or cause.
   These question words, when part of a noun phrase, precede the pronoun
or classifier, but follow the demonstrative (498) and the relative (11, 350).
When question words are part of a postpositional phrase, the position of
that phrase in the clause and in the sentence does not change                       (21, 242).
  The interrogative word kini ‘And . . . ?/And what about.                          . . ?’ follows

absence of interrogative words and the lack of sentence final glottal stop.
     Polar questions      may    consist of a whole          sentence,   a clause,    a phrase,    or,
in rare cases, the tense-modality marker within the verb. The response may
be an affirmative or negative word, with or without the elements mentioned
above    (whole    sentence,      clause,   phrase,    etc.). The    response     words      are awai
‘yes’ and ma ‘no’.(255a)     hapoka              wa     naka       ___kupili

"14.2.1 Contrary-to-fact subordinate clauses. In contrary to fact subordinate
clauses, the subordinate clause expresses a hypothetical condition and the
main clause expresses the hypothetical result.
   The marker for present tense hypothetical condition in the subordinate
clause is hakdénaha or its contraction akéna (with dialect variation of
hakunoha or akunoha). With the past tense the same marker occurs, but
the completive -ma occurs on the verb.
   The hypothetical result in the main clause is expressed by the aspect pi
or its dialectal variation pipi for present affirmative. Present negative
aspects are kupi or kipi when the negative mi is used, and pi when the
negative ma is used. Past hypothetical result is expressed by noa kupi.(395)       mak6         héla_   mi      ak6na, hise                ha         sa

are object complement clauses, taking on the function of the object of the
verb in the main clause. In the verbs of these clauses there occurs only the
stem of the verb or the stem plus a single-vowel aspect marker (sect. 18.2).
The only verbs used in the main clause in this type of construction are ta
‘to see’, mod ‘to watch’,           and hini ‘to hear’.(404)       sa      tu            wehe                              ta          -a                 ko         -ta

"11.1 The regular imperative construction11.1.1 Morphological restrictions and modifications in the imperative. In
the regular imperative, there are no verb-final markers showing tense,
degree of knowledge, and degree of fulfillment. One                    marker, -pd, indicating
74   Borgman
desired fulfillment, is used for the hortative imperative-like construction
discussed in 11.2.1.
   In the imperative (as in subordinate sequential clauses), the change focus
-so becomes -lo or -to; -pi becomes -po or -pa; -ki becomes -ké; and -li

the subject of the verb in the regular imperative is second person, but this
does not have to be overtly expressed, although in the nontransitive
76    Borgman
constructions more often than not it is expressed.                                        When        it is expressed,
either the 3rd person or 2nd person pronouns are employed. This use of
the 3rd person pronoun meaning ‘you’ is unique to the imperative.
Following are examples of the use of the pronouns with the various verb
classes.
   The 3rd person pronoun is used for the stative, intransitive (except for
speech verbs), and activity semitransitive verbs which are in the imperative.(270)         a     hiso   _—pasi    -0                                     -6

stress falls on the final syllable of the verb for peremptory commands and
on the penultimate syllable for less peremptory commands. For peremptory
commands the exclamatory particle -6 is added in the final syllable. When
the vowel of the final syllable is already -6, this vowel drops when the
exclamatory -o is added, and in this case this -6 is glided. When the final
vowel is -u, the exclamatory -6 assimilates to -u (276, 285).
   Even though stress is pointed out by the stress mark (') here, this does
not appear in the normal writing of Sanuma. The final stress in the
peremptory command is indicated by the exclamation point. (Exclamation in
Sanuma always is indicated by stress on the sentence-final syllable and is
indicated by an exclamation point.)

tihe, refers to the prohibition of an action or state which could possibly
take place. If the action or state has already taken place and there is an
imperative-like reprimand, another construction with the negative mai-ké is
used (sect. 11.2.3). The negative imperative marked by tihe has only the
3rd person pronoun for subject except for transitive and ditransitive
constructions, which have the 2nd person. The stress considerations
indicating peremptoriness mentioned in the above section apply to the
negative imperatives as well.

often uses the third person pronoun form when referring semantically to
second person, the imperative-like constructions use only the second person
pronoun form when referring to second person. There are three
imperative-like constructions: the hortative, implorative, and negative.","[59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65]"
"18.3.1     Complete           fulfillment.      The      marker      for complete        fulfillment      is -ma
‘completive’ which indicates also that the state or event has taken place
without any focus on degree of knowledge. There are instances of -ma
indicating completion of a hypothetical situation that has not yet occurred.
In these cases, the -ma occurs with a verb in a subordinate clause (379b,
380). (For examples of -ma indicating completion in the past see 1-5, 18,
27, 41, 73, 74.)
196     Borgman18.3.2 Possible              fulfillment.        Possible       fulfillment     is marked      by matimd,        which
always speaks of a future possibility.(804)          wa           ke        -la        -sO          matim6

               “You might fall.’18.3.3 Desired fulfillment. Desired fulfillment is expressed by -pd and is
translated by ‘ought to’ or ‘let’s . . .’. (See sect. 11.2.1 with examples, and
also    exs.        231,    393,      436,    439,     466,   630,   and    659;   -pé   is also   used   signifying
purpose in a subordinate clause—see sect. 14.1.3, exs. 386, 387.)18.3.4 Intended fulfillment. Intended fulfillment is expressed by pia ‘intend’
plus either kule ‘present witnessed’,                                when the fulfillment is immediate
future, or salo ‘result’, when the time                              of fulfillment is further on than the
immediate            future. The             gloss for intended            fulfillment   can   be either ‘intend
to’ or ‘about to’.
   (For pia kule, see exs. 199, 218, 236, 243, 386, 433, 456,                                        472; for pia
salo, see exs. 102, 171, 198, 239, 240, 266a, 408, 409, 464;                                         for pia salo
signifying intention in a subordinate clause, see exs. 174, 384.)18.3.5 Indefinite fulfillment. The markers wi and noai indicate indefiniteness
or incompletion as to fulfillment. (See sect. 15.3.2.2 for the indefinite -i
which is used with descriptive verbs.)
   wi is usually used in relative constructions and nominalizations (529-533,
535-540, 558-565, 573, 632), but also can be found in the comparative
construction (658), the sequential construction (370, 371), the contrary-to-
expectation construction with maaki ‘even though’ (805, 806), idiomatically
with     kuno         mai          ‘negative’    (341),       and,    in   at   least    one   dialect,   with     the
suppositional kite (807).
   noai indicates indefinite past and occurs in conjunction with the
suppositional kite (693, 694), with the relative construction (16, 534, 633),
with the comparative construction (659), with the hypothetical result
construction (616), with the temporal postpositions ha/hamé (359,                                                 360,
642-644, 704, 770), and with the contrary-to-expectation maaki (808).(805)          i            na         kamaké6         ku     wi            maaki, .. .

          ‘Even though there might have been only rapids, . . .’18.3.6 Settled     fulfillment. The            marker        -w6 indicates that the state or action
of the verb is a settled state or action. This has been labeled as ‘subject
emphasis’ in that, with the use of -w6, there seems to be a portrayal of the
subject as one who is characterized by the state or action of the predicate
(188, 189, 304, 448, 450, 451).
  -w6 is used not only on verbs, but on certain post-head adverbs (sect.
18.7)   when     employed        as     modifiers,      not    of a verb,          but    of another       type     of
phrase such as noun, time, location, or manner (219, 442).","[181, 182, 183]"
"  There        is   one       case        in        which     either         ma       or     mi    can     occur:     with    the

main clause is in past tense. In this case, the conjunction has two different
meanings: a temporal meaning with ma and a cause meaning with mi.

"3.1   Omission       of nonverbal           constituents
3.1.1 Omission of the subject. The                           omission        of the subject            is common          in
transitive and ditransitive clauses.

expressed in the immediate context, and this type of omission usually
occurs only in a narrative. In one narrative, for example, someone says,
Give him a gun. The next sentence lacks the expected object:

is   either        an    ideophone           or,    as       in   the     above    case,   a   verb   stem     used   in
narrative with little or no affixation, which gives a quasi-ideophonic effect

instances in which both the subject and object may be absent. The first is
in imperatives when the object is perfectly clear from context.(120)         oa        -l6
              eat       -FOC

42   Borgman   The other instance in which both subject and object may be absent is in
narrative when the speaker utilizes ideophones or verb stems without
affixes (see sect. 3.1.2) and the subject and object are known from the
immediate context.(122)     saa     na        -nd    -ka,                      soho

understood by the immediate context, linguistic or nonlinguistic.

"19.3 Locative adjectives. There are two classes of locative adjectives:
intrinsic and extrinsic. The intrinsic locative adjective indicates a location in
relation to the noun itself. Usually this location is some part of the item
such as ola ‘top part’, hdsdéka ‘surface’, etc. Some intrinsic locational
adjectives are also body parts as in hikali hiko ‘garden forehead’, i.e., ‘top
part of garden’ (192), and maa ma-k6é pal6k6é ‘rock CLASS-DL chest’, i.e.,
‘side of mountain’.
210     Borgman      If the noun which is the point of reference is clear, it may be deleted in
an intrinsic locative phrase                  as in kolo ha ‘bottom                   at’, i.e., ‘downriver’.
      The     extrinsic     locative     adjective      indicates           a        location         in     relation        to an
object outside of the noun.                     There      is only one                 adjective            in this class, pi
‘inside of            (209, 561, 646, 672, 674,         714,   715,         750).           Here      again,        if the noun
which is modified is clear from the context, the noun may be deleted (209).
  pi is also used as the first element of one type of compound verb (sect.
18.8), where            the second      element      of the compound                    verb         is a        stative verb or
a speech verb and in which the pi signifies a state or action inside the
actor or subject. This is in contrast to the use of pi as a locative adjective,
in which case the state or action is outside the actor or subject.
      Another          reason    we     have     considered           pi        to     be     one           of     the      locative
adjectives is its use alone with the noun, as in the word for ‘match’: koa
taka pi ‘fire CLASS inside’.","[195, 196]"

that there are certain features required                     to occur in the main clause when
this     type      of     subordinate    clause        occurs.      In    chained          constructions,   the
subordinate clause always precedes the main clause. There are two types of
chained subordinate clauses: contrary to fact and comparison.","[86, 87, 88]"

13 AnaphoraAnaphora        takes      place    chiefly    through         the     use     of pronouns.            Deletion       is
treated   in sect.        3. Pronouns      are specific, general,             and        characteristic classifier
pronouns (sect. 16.1), personal pronouns (sect. 16.2), demonstratives (sect.
16.4), and relative pronouns (sect. 16.5).
   The indefinite pronoun pi followed by the naha ‘like’ is an example of
backward anaphora, and in rare instances the relative pronoun                                              i followed
by naha ‘like’ is also used cataphorically (433, 434).","[74, 75]"
"16.2.1     Listing    and    description     of personal        pronouns.    Personal      pronouns
have both long and short forms. In the first person plural there is also the
distinction of exclusive and inclusive, excluding or including the listener or
listeners. First person plural inclusive and second person plural have the
same pronoun and only context determines which referent is intended.
  The first and second person singular long and short forms are kamisa,                             sa
‘1:SG’ and kawa, wa ‘2:SG’. With the markers -né and niha the second
person singular personal pronoun has alternate forms depending on the
speaker. Some use a form closer to that used in the Yanomam dialect of
Yanomami,            kaho.     Thus,       the      alternate      forms     in     Sanuma         are
kawa-n6/kao-né/kau-noé and kawa niha/kao niha/kau niha (593).
  The first and second person plural long and short forms are kamisamaké,
samaké ‘1:PL:EXCL’ and kamak6é, maké ‘1:PL:INCL/2:PL’ (599). The short
forms for the first and second               plural when        used as agent in a         transitive
clause are sama         ‘1:PL:EXCL’        and ma    ‘1:PL:INCL/2:PL’       (458, 459, 602).
  The third person short form pronouns are the same as the singular, dual,
and      plural general and specific classifier pronouns. The                 third person long
and      short form pronouns are kama, aj/te ‘3:SG’, kama                     t6ék6é| kama k6k6
‘3:DL’, and kama topo / kama pé ‘3:PL’.",[135]
"14.1.1 Juxtaposed subordinate clauses with a temporal relationship. The
tense, degree of knowledge, and location markers do not occur with the
time relators in this type of subordinate             clause, with one exception: the
completive aspect -ma can occur with tehe ‘when, during’ when expressing
subsequent action (exs. 357, 358). In these temporal subordinate clauses,
the tense      of the   subordinate    clause   is known     from   the   tense   of   the   main
clause.
   The temporal relationships of the subordinate clauses to the main clause
are labeled here as simultaneous, prior, subsequent, sequential, and perfect
action. In the prior and subsequent relationships, it is the action or state of
the main clause which is prior or subsequent to that of the subordinate
clause; in the sequential, it is the action of the main clause which follows
as a sequence to that of the subordinate clause.
   Simultaneous action is expressed either by the relator tehe ‘during the
time when, when,’ or the relator paha/pa ‘at the time when, as, while’. (See
(376, 377) in sect. 14.1.2 for paha indicating also a locative relationship,

 Semantically, there is little difference between sequential and subsequent
 action. Structurally, there may be a series of sequential subordinate clauses,
 this is not true of clauses expressing subsequent action.

differently, their meaning is very nearly the same, and the notable
difference in the usage of the two is that ha indicates a change of subject

            “When my father died, I went back over there again.’     There is an idiomatic construction using the sequential nd, to which is
usually      suffixed              the      confirmative          marker         -ké,         in     which        there       are

following in the same                      sentence.       Examples       are included               here    to show this
idiomatic        usage        of the sequential             -nd, in which            the next action              or state in

            ‘That’s what I’ve been saying.’     The   third means              of expressing sequential action, not as common                                        as the
above two, is by the use of the completive aspect ma with rising intonation.
With this construction, the sequential feature is translated by ‘after, and
then’. (See (193) for the completive -ma being used in a series of
coordinate constructions which do not convey a sequence. It might be
possible to interpret the constructions in the following examples as
coordinate,        but        we      have     not        done   so     because         the        usage     of     -ma     here
parallels so closely that of the other sequential relators which are clearly
subordinate markers.) In none of the examples available for this
construction is there a completive or past tense marker in the main clause.
If the verb in the main clause is future or present (not historical present as
in 368, 369), the -ma indicates not only sequential action, but also condition
(sect. 14.1.3, exs. 379b and 380).

           ‘I left my house, and then right away I go to the Isalo Pi Valley.’  The fourth way of expressing sequential action is through the indefinite
marker wi, which is clause final. This marker is labeled ‘indefinite’ because
it is more generally used in relative and nominalization constructions
without     reference        to aspect             or sequence.                (See        sects.     15.3.2.1         and     15.4.)
Also,     unlike     the     other            subordinating           relators,              wi      never       occurs        in    a
fragmentary sentence in which the main clause is deleted. In the examples
below, even though the clause with wi is translated as a_participial
construction, the action is not simultaneous with that of the main clause,
and it is treated as a sequential marker, although the idea of sequence is
not aS prominent as it is with the other sequence markers.(370)      hise      ha _      sa              a          -su            -16            wi,              hi

           the rapids, having put the canoe on land down there, we first put

which continues on into the present. There are ways to express this type of
action or state within one independent clause (sect. 18.1.2.2 on thai/thali),
but another way is to employ a subordinate clause, with the verb ku- ‘be’
in the main clause expressing the fact that this former condition still exists.
   Positive perfect action may be expressed by the use of a sequential
construction with the completive -ma in the subordinate clause (see above);
with the main clause introduced by the manner phrase i naha ‘like that’.(372)      sutu     ha                    i   naha a    wani_                           ku -o     -ma,

           ‘He has been like that for a long time.’     Negative       perfect     action         employs        the     negative          mai,     with   or   without   the
relator ha ‘upon, when’.","[76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82]"
"18.1.1.1 Present witnessed. If the state or event is in present time, then
location is also included. In analyzing the list below, it is possible to make
further subdivisions and conclude that ku- indicates ‘witness’, -la- ‘horizontal
location’, -po- ‘vertical location’, and -kili ‘down’, whether horizontal or
vertical. Further dissection might be possible, but probably not too useful.
  kule      ‘near        the         speaker’    is     the        only      present        tense-degree             of
knowledge-location              marker     that is used            with   all verbs.       The     other    markers
listed below are not used with description and emotion verbs. (When kule
occurs on these verbs, they become derived receptive verbs. Also there is
the exceptional usage of kimati ‘going away from speaker’ with the verb
topa ‘good’, with the meaning ‘progressing well’, as in 671.)
   For a sampling of the usage of kule see (19, 24-26, 48, 51-53,                                        69, 71, 72,
and 101).
   One other observation                 in connection with kule is that at times the strict
meaning      of     ‘present-witnessed-here’                is    stretched    a   bit,     in    the    sense     that
tense is still present time, but the location might be away from the speaker
and the event not necessarily                    witnessed          at the    moment            of speaking.       The
following is one example.

progressive action is emphasized rather than the action being witnessed.(675)       ma_     te       hala      pole

           ‘Is it the one going around here?’18.1.1.2 Past witnessed. A state or event witnessed in past time is either
immediate past, recent past, or distant past.
   The immediate past is marked by ke/kehe/kuhe which indicates the same
morning, same afternoon, or same night in which the speaker is reporting.
(See    exs.     56,   115,   116,    145,     206,       217-219,     617.)    The     kuhe     form   is archaic.
Our hypothesis              is that the older form kuhe changed                          to kehe with the u
changing to e to conform to the second e, and that then the A dropped to
give the much more commonly used ke.
   The recent past is marked by kupi/kdpi/kipi which indicates the same 24
hour period but not the same                          morning,       afternoon, or night during which
the speaker is reporting. (See ex. 612.)
   The distant past is marked by kupili/képili/kipili which indicates yesterday
or before. (See exs. 55, 213, 255a, 260, 609, 611.) Among Sanuma speakers
there is dialectal difference in the use of kupili versus k6pili versus kipili,
with some modification also according to the vowel preceding this marker.
After a front vowel most speakers use kipili, whereas after a back vowel,
most    use kupili.
   The completive -ma discussed in sect. 18.3.1 can be considered as a past
tense marker and its use does not necessarily preclude the state or event
having been witnessed by the speaker.","[151, 152, 153, 154, 155]"
"22.5     Morphophonemic          processes.      Palatalization      (see    sect.     22.1.1     under    k)
has already been mentioned in the description of the phonology.                                           The
following is a summary of processes that pertain to the morphology.
22.5.1 Assimilation. Two vowels affected by the assimilatory process are 0
and e.
   6, when preceding contiguously the vowel i, harmonizes with that vowel:
kuii (ku-6-i be-CUST-INDEF in 188, 234, 555, 557); dpii (6épé-i
INTNSF-INDEF in 187, 213, 546, 548). Also the first 6 of the intensifier
harmonizes with the preceding vowel (sect. 18.7.3).
      If not preceded        by a pause,   the        first 6 of the     classifier 6s6         harmonizes
with any preceding vowel except i (see also 192): watata asé (watata 6s0
cloth CLASS); amito osé (amito 6s6 airplane CLASS); pu usé (pu 6s6
sugar cane); lapai dsé (lapai 6s6 a type of banana plant).
   The vowel 6 in the confirmative -ké6 and the dualizer -ké usually
harmonizes with an i if this is the only vowel of a preceding syllable and if
the 6 is not followed by another syllable with 6 (as in 883): tiki (ti-kd
wood-DL); hukiki (huki-k6 today-CNFRM).
  The vowel e assimilates to the vowel of the following morpheme                                   in many
cases and to the following w in one instance: t6k6 (te-k6 TEMP-CNFRM);
ton6 (te-n6d 3:SG-AG); to wani (te wani 3:SG DEPR).
   In certain words, the final e assimilates to the following a or drops out.
This is rare, and thus far we have retained the e in the orthography: poose
a [poosa a] or [poos a] ‘his younger brother/her younger sister’; hise ha
[hitSa ha] or [hits a] ‘here at’.
22.5.2 Deletion. One example of deletion is mentioned in the previous
paragraph. There are also examples of deletion of 6 and, less commonly, of
u and e. In certain words, 6, u, and e drop before the aspect particles -a
and -o: sima (simd-a send-DUR); simo (simd-o send-PUNCT); hatuka
(hatuku-a open-DUR); hatuko (hatuku-o open-PUNCT), seleko (seleke-o
separate-PUNCT).
      Also,   before   the verification particles a and o, there                 is deletion of the o:
tela!     (te-lé-a     get-FOC-VERIF);           ai     taka   (ai     ta-ké-a       INTERJECTION
obvious-CNFRM-VERIF); sa loiko (sa loi-k6 o 1:SG sit-FOC VERIF).
      There    is deletion     of one   a@ when         two    of them      are      contiguous      across
morpheme boundaries: pa kule (pa-a kule lie:on:ground -DUR PRES), dla
sa niapali (6la sa a nia-pa-li jaguar 1:SG:SUBJECT 3:SG:OBJECT

shoot-EXT-FOC).
22.5.3 Replacement.        Replacement     takes place in the change       focus markers
(sects.   11.1   and   18.2.5.2) and   in the location markers   (sect.   18.6.2, exs. 830,
831).","[212, 213]"
"11.2.1 The hortative imperative-like construction. The hortative has the
aspect marker -pd/-p6k6 (which is considered to be a desiderative marker,
indicating desire or purpose, in constructions which semantically are
obviously nonhortative) and can be translated ‘should, let’. All three
persons may be used as subject. The negative occurs, but is not common.(289)      wa      ia          ko             k6l6.—         -pdk6

mi is used, followed by the relator salo ‘purpose, result’, which is sentence
final. In this idiomatic expression the intonation pattern is unique, the fing}
salo having a higher tone than the preceding negative mi. (296)     ipa po              wa        toto -a           hai     -0         mi      __salo

 confirmative clitic -kd/-ki and, unlike the regular negative imperative, this
 prohibition refers more to a state or action already accomplished or in
 progress and acts more as a reprimand.

12 NegationSentence         negation is expressed by either one of two negatives, ma or mi.
The      negative    imperative    marker    tihe   has     been    discussed   in   sect.   11.1.4.
Both ma          and mi can be verb stems in their own                 right, but can also be

"22.4.7 Aspirated plosives and affricates. [th], [ts], and [ph] (this latter found
only in ideophones) are interpreted as one consonant inasmuch as there
are no'consonant clusters except in ideophones. For convenience the [th]
and [ph] are written as two consonants in the orthography, and [ts] is
written as s (for the reasons given in sect. 22.1.1): tha-6 ‘he makes’; luthe
‘moldy’; phatu ‘a sudden, fast departure (ideophone)’; sandéma_ [tsanima]
‘Sanuma’.
                                                                                                         Sanuma    225
22.4.8 Nasalization. It has been stated that all vowels except one have
nasalized counterparts (sect. 22.1.2); there are other features of nasalization
which have not been discussed.
   If the first vowel of a word is nasalized, all the following vowels are also
nasalized unless there is an intervening nonnasal consonant, and these
following nasalized vowels are not marked                              as such in the orthography.: hia
[haa] ‘nose’; héto [héto] ‘handle’.
   If the first consonant of a syllable is m or n, the syllable is considered
nasalized      with       nasalization      on     the        vowel,     even          though    this    nasalization
might not be as                  strong as a regular nasalized vowel. Within                                       the
grammatical word,                [I] becomes n after a nasalized syllable, and                                     the
resultant      syllable    becomes       nasalized.           In these        cases,     in the orthography        we
have conformed to the Sanuma preference of writing n and not /. Thus /a-li
‘EXT-FOC’ added to oa hena ‘eat (it) early’ becomes oa hena-na-ni ‘eat
(it) early’.
    Also for simplicity in the orthography, when a nasalized vowel causes the
following      | to become          n, we    have         not       written     the     marker    for nasalization
over this nasalized vowel. Thus k6 ‘return’ plus the focus marker -li is ko-ni
‘retrieve’.
   A nasal vowel may lose its nasalization before a syllable starting with a
plosive; thus ké ‘return’ plus the focus marker -pi may be either [k6-pi] or
[ko-pi], and again for simplicity of orthography, we have not written this
nasal.","[210, 211]"
"18.3.7 Hypothetical fulfillment. Hypothetical fulfillment constructions have
two clauses: the subordinate clause which is the hypothetical condition, and
the main clause which is the hypothetical result. (See sect. 14.2.1, with exs.
395-399.)18.4 Person,       number,        gender.          Person     and     gender       are    not     categories      that
occur   in the verb phrase.             As for number,              there is one         marker,      -he/-e, which
occurs with transitive verbs and is verb-phrase final. It indicates that the
subject is plural and that the object is singular (93, 113, 411). More times
than not, the subject is not overtly stated in the same clause (as in 113).
There are rare examples in which the subject is singular in form, but in
which it is understood that there is more than one agent involved in the
action. The following is one of these examples, in which it is clear from the
198     Borgmanpreceding narrative portion that Omawd’s                            brother cooperated         with Omawé

"18.1.3.1 Supposition regarding the future. With any verb other than
description and emotion, kite refers to a strong supposition regarding the

perfect aspect are also employed as in sects. 18.1.3.3 and                                18.1.3.4. (For kite

aspectual. Durative is a linear or progressive aspect along a time line, as in
‘He is writing’. Punctiliar is an aspect in which the action or state is
conceived               of as a       totality,        a single           conceptual              unit,       an      action         regarded       as
an event or single fact without reference to the length of time it occupied.
‘He writes a letter’ or ‘He wrote a letter’ would be punctiliar in contrast to
‘He        is    writing         a    letter’        or     ‘He         was     writing           a        letter’,        which          would     be
durative. Iterative indicates that there is repeated activity within one action
as in ‘distribute,                   hand     out,        give     out’       versus         ‘give’,        and       as      in ‘walk’         versus
‘go’. Habitual/customary or nonaspectual expresses a general fact without
reference to a time line. The tense markers and the completive are notably
absent when nonaspectual markers occur. Nonaspectual is seen in such
expressions as ‘He writes (he knows how to write)’ or ‘People sit; birds
perch’.
     The choice of markers for these aspects depends on the verb class with
which they occur. These are first described (sect. 18.2.1.1) and this is
followed by a section on mechanical rules governing -a and -o (sect.
18.2.1.2).","[158, 159]"
"18.6.1 Direction. The directional occurs only with verbs of motion and
indicates whether the actor is going away from a given point, approaching
it, or arriving.
    -hél6 ‘leaving’ is by far the most commonly used of the directionals. The
first vowel -6 usually becomes a reduplication of whatever vowel precedes
the -hdlé. The h is usually dropped and often the reduplicated vowel is also
dropped, except in the imperatives, in which the stress is on the first
syllable of -hdlé (447, 827, 828). Thus -/6 is the most common form. (55,
58, 59, 89, 291, 368, 371, 618, 642).

         ‘Go away again.’  -ima ‘approaching’ is usually in relation to the speaker, but does not
need to be (186, 358, 438, 569, 646).
  -so/-soldé ‘arriving’ is always in relationship to the main actor, usually the
speaker. (See exs. 451 and 647 for -solé and ex. 539 for -so.)18.6.2 Location.            The locationals Jaso/taso/kél6) indicate a topographical
relationship with           the point of reference being a river or clearing or even
ground    versus       air.        Unlike       the        directionals            and    the     clarifier     alu,     these
locationals can occur with the durative -a (82, 443, 654).
   laso indicates either ‘up’ or ‘across’ (e.g., ‘upriver, up                                         in the air, up             a
tree, up a mountain,’ etc.’) (94, 269a, 448, 654).
  taso   indicates      ‘inland         (from      river),           outside’,      or   ‘in the      forest’    (186,     247,
268a, 369, 443, 448, 731).
   -l6 and -t6 are alternate forms for -laso and -taso respectively in
imperative constructions (268b, 269b, 283, 607). Also taso becomes -t6 when
followed by the sequential nd or by the temporal marker tehe/te (830, 831).
  kolé indicates ‘downstream’                     (82, 153, 208, 213, 215, 289, 328, 371, 413).(829)    opo                  sa         wai                  se        -a           sisa_-pa              -li           taso

occurs only with the witnessed modality (kule, ke, kupi, kupili). The speaker
employs alu to clarify to the listener an action which the latter might not
readily notice, understand, or expect.(833)       ...sa      ku pa       -a ti                     -a      alu    kule

Most of the adverbs follow the                  verb head and precede the causative,
change focus, direction-location, negative, and tense-modality markers, but
there is a class of three adverbs which precede the verb head. With the
verb head, these adverbs form a unit which in turn can be further modified
by the adverbs which follow the head.
  Special attention is given to the intensifier adverb -épé.","[188, 189, 190]"
"22.4.9 The       mid      open    fronted    central vowel              a. It has been           shown    that there
is contrast between              [a], [e], and      [i], and          [a] has been          written as d@ in our
orthography and throughout this paper.
   The    occurrence         of [3] is not common.                     In a collection           of text material,
this   vowel      constituted        only    .6%         in     a   count      of      170,500    phonemes.       The
orthography of Venezuelan                   Sanuma            does not include [a], and because of
the desirability of having one orthography for all Sanuma, we have devised
the following as one possible alternate description, considering [a] as a
variant of either e or 6:
   (1) [2] is a variant of e when e occurs consecutively separated only by /
or p. (The only exception to this would be in a word beginning with s as in
seleke [seleke]        ‘separate’.): hele        [hala] ‘swim,           rain’; helele      [halala]     ‘smell’; pele
[palo] ‘drip’; wele [wala] ‘go downstream’; tepe [topa] ‘anteater’; epena koké
[apena kiki] ‘type of snake’; epeti [apati] ‘soft’.
   (2) [a] is a variant of e when it occurs before the syllable #6. In this case
there is free variation between [9] and [i] in this syllable: hetépo [hotepo]
or [hotipo] ‘in various places’.
   (3) [a] is a variant of e in monosyllabic roots the consonant of which is /
or w: le [lo] ‘encounter’; we [wa] ‘inform, mark a limit’.
226     Borgman      (4) [2] is a variant of 6 in monosyllabic roots the consonant of which is
p, th, k or h: po [pa] ‘cut in two’; pd- [pa] ‘only, just’; thd [tha] ‘prepare roll
of tobacco’; ké [ko] ‘fracture’; hd [ha] ‘burn’.
   (5) [9] is a variant of 6 in disyllabic roots when the vowel of the second
syllable is not 6: péka [poka] ‘small hole’; pdla [pala] ‘definitely not’.","[211, 212]"
