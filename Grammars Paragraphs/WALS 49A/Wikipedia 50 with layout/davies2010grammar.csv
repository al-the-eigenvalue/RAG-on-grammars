4. The role of -e and -agiOutside their use in causatives, the presence of -e and -agi in a clause largely
328    Chapter 10 Modifications to argument structure
indicates that an argument that is syntactically oblique in the basic usage of the
verb is a core argument in the clause. The data in section 1 demonstrate that -e
is correlated with the presence of a core argument bearings a locative thematic
role, including goal and goal-stimulus roles. The data in section 2 illustrate a
correlation between -agi and the presence of a core argument with benefactive,
instrumental, or subject matter thematic role. While generally considered appli-
cative affixes in the literature on closely related languages (Arka 2003 on Bali-
nese, Musgrave 2001 and Ross 2002 on Indonesian, Donohue 1999 on Tukang
Besi), in these instances, these affixes actually parallel the function of the voice
morphology. Specifically, as -e/-agi indicate linking of specific thematic roles
with core argument status, actor voice indicates that the subject bears the ac-
tor/agent role and object voice indicates that the theme or some other non-actor
argument is the subject. Viewed in this way, -e and -agi (in these uses) might be
correctly considered part of the voice system and not merely applicative affixes.
       On this view, Madurese is more closely allied with other western Austro-
nesian languages recognized as having more highly articulated voice systems,
languages such as the Philippine languages, Formosan languages, and Malaga-
sy. For example, in Philippine languages, arguments bearing many different
thematic roles can serve as subject of a clause. Special verbal morphology oc-
curs depending on the role of the argument selected as subject. The sentences in
(168) from Tagalog illustrate.","[344, 345]"

3. Functions of reduplicationReduplication is used in the majority of cases to signal plurality. This can be
plurality of actions, plurality of entities, plurality of effect, either directly or by
metaphorical extension. This is familiar from other languages, and many of the
specific grammatical functions and meanings have been noted for reduplication
in other languages. However, not all instances of reduplication have any ob-
vious connection to plurality, as in the case of denoting imitation or toy objects
1
 Note that the a in aberka'an ‘run often’ is the actor voice prefix and so occurs only in
the first instance of the root, whereas the initial a in ajaran ‘study often’ is part of the
root ajar and thus is present on the root and the copy.
138 Chapter 5 Reduplication(in section 3.2 on nouns) or the ‘pretend to X’ instance of verbs (section 3.1.3).
And some particular structures involve the combination of reduplication with a
particular affix or affixes. While some of the functions of reduplication cross-
cut lexical classes, there are important exceptions; therefore, the presentation is
organized by lexical classes.","[154, 155]"

   I adopted the 1973 standard in 2000 at the request of my language consultants in Ma-
dura, who were uncomfortable with the orthography I had been using, which used the
same graphemes for consonants as the new standard (except glottal stop, represented
with q as in the Dutch system, e.g. Davies 1999).
Chapter 3
Lexical categories
This chapter considers the issue of what lexical categories should be recognized
in Madurese. As in any language, there are both open class categories–
categories that readily admit new items either through coinage or borrowing–
and closed class categories–those that resist new items. For the most part, the
set of closed class categories identifiable in Madurese is similar to those in re-
lated languages: pronouns, demonstratives, numerals and quantifiers, preposi-
tions, adverbs, auxiliaries, conjunctions and assorted particles.
       An issue of potential contention in analyses of Austronesian languages is
identifying the set of open class categories, basically the categories correspond-
ing to noun, verb, and adjective in Indo-European languages. The majority of
recent analyses posit a distinction between nouns and verbs. However, they are
divided about whether to recognize a class of adjectives distinct from verbs.
Although adjective has been recognized as a separate class in much early work,
this may simply reflect the lens of the Western grammatical tradition through
which they were viewed. Recently, a number of linguists have argued on the
basis of morphological properties and syntactic distribution that in many Aus-
tronesian languages a category of adjective distinct from verbs is unwarranted
(e.g. Donohue 1999, Klamer 1998, van den Berg 1989) Further, in some of
these languages the line dividing nouns and verbs is somewhat blurred. For
instance, Foley (1998) has proposed that the noun/verb distinction is irrelevant
in Tagalog (and by extension other Philippine languages). Rather, roots are
‘precategorial’ and lexical classes are identifiable only from the syntactic envi-
ronment in which the word occurs.1 Regardless of the correctness or incorrect-
ness of this proposal for a particular language, sets of precategorial roots have
been suggested for a number of Austronesian languages in which the noun/verb
distinction is posited.
       Section 1 examines open class items and proposes that Madurese includes
the categories noun and verb and a subcategory adjective. It also takes up the
issue of precategorial roots. The remaining lexical classes are briefly discussed
and exemplified in section 2.","[77, 78]"

 Schachter (1976) and Schachter and Otanes (1972) refer to the subject as the 'topic'.
Here T = topic, A = actor, G = goal, D = direction, and B = benefactive. Thus AT = actor
topic , GT = goal topic, and so on.
                                                        The role of -e and -agi 329
In (168), ang marks the topic (subject) of the clause. In (168a), the actor, babae
‘woman’ is subject and the verb takes future actor topic morphology (in bold).
In (168b), the theme (goal), bigas ‘rice’ is subject and the verb take future goal
topic morphology. (168c,d) show the same for direction (locative) and benefac-
tive arguments. As illustrated amply in Schachter and Otanes 1972, in Tagalog,
the types of arguments that can be selected as subject and associated with dis-
tinct verbal (voice) morphology include actor, theme (goal), location/goal (di-
rection), beneficiary, instrument, subject matter, time, manner, and others. The
first six of these are the same roles that can be core syntactic arguments in Ma-
durese, and like Tagalog, each is associated with specific verbal morphology
(except when the theme is object and there is no overt affix).
        There is, however, some question as to whether or not -e and -agi suffixes
are properly treated as voice morphemes. Most analyses of Indonesian-type
languages do not do so, and the Indonesian voice system is generally characte-
rized as a two-voice system (Wolff 1996, Ross 2002, 2005). There have been
alternative views though. Naylor (1978) explicitly draws the parallel between
Philippine languages and Indonesian. Using the term ‘focus’ (as is standard in
some of the literature), Naylor identifies Indonesian -i as ‘locative focus’ and
-kan as ‘instrument focus’, and posits a null affix for ‘goal focus’ (marking
themes as objects). Verhaar (1984) treats -i and -kan as part of the same system
as the active (meng-) and passive (di-), referring to -i as the ‘locative role mark-
er’ and describing -kan as marking one of five ‘semantic species’–’benefactive’,
‘instrument’, ‘dative-accusative’, ‘accusative-accusative’, and ‘noncausative’.
Additionally, he identifies men...i and men...kan as circumfixes ‘deriving men-
verbs’ (1984:6), underscoring an analysis in which actor voice and -i and -kan
are part of the same system. More recently, Musgrave, while stopping short of
analyzing Indonesian -i and -kan as part of the voice system, does provide four
arguments that ‘suggest that the Indonesian system is related’ to the Philippine
systems (2001:72).
        The apparent derivational nature of -e and -agi suffixes (especially with
causatives) contributes to the applicative analysis. But the distinction between
derivation and inflection in Madurese is blurred, and it is far from crystal clear
that actor voice morphology is purely inflectional. As described in Chapter 3
and Chapter 4, many lexical items denoting nominal entities can be used as
verbs when affixed with the actor voice morpheme. Examples of this include:(169)   root                      actor voice
        are' ‘scythe’             ngare' ‘cut with a scythe’

        kalambi ‘shirt’          akalambi ‘wear a shirt’
        kaos ‘t-shirt’           akaos ‘wear a t-shirt’The forms in (169) portray the actor voice in a distinctly derivational manner.
The left-hand column appears to consist of a list of nouns and the right-hand
column as verbs derived from them through affixation of ng- or a-. Additional-
ly, as the affixation of ng- or a- creates an argument-taking predicate, this
process introduces an argument slot into the lexical item, much as an applicative
morpheme can. This increases the parallelism between some uses of -e and -agi
and ng- and a-. Clearly, when used with transitive and ditransitive verb roots,
actor voice morphology is not always associated with an increase in the valence
of its host or derives a verb from an item from a different lexical category. It is
equally clear that the same is true of -e and -agi. Outside of causatives, -e and
-agi do not add to the semantic valence of the verbs to which they are affixed.
Thus, -e and -agi are no more straightforwardly derivational than is actor voice
ng- and a-.
       Other analyses of the facts in (169) are, of course, conceivable. The forms
in the left-hand column need not be analyzed as nouns. It is possible that they
are zero-derived verbs (such as hammer and saw in English), in which case the
actor voice forms in the right-hand column are simply inflected verbs. That said,
there is no particular evidence that determines such an analysis as necessarily
correct. Discussion in Chapter 3 section 3.4 suggests the possibility of analyzing
these as precategorial roots. But such an analysis entails that the actor voice
morphology in these cases derives a verb from a precategorial root. The preca-
tegorial root analysis for Philippine languages entails that voice morphology
there is associated with derivation of just this sort (Foley 1998, Kroeger 1998,
Himmelmann 2007). So, in this view, Philippine voice is derivational and not
inflectional. If Austronesian voice systems (including that of Madurese) should
be considered purely inflectional or derivational begs an easy answer.
       The distribution of -e and -agi points to an additional similarity to Taga-
log voice. While -e and -agi can occur with verbs taking actor voice, speakers

treat some of these as ‘possible, but odd’, sometimes distinctly so. More impor-
tantly, actual usage indicates that outside of causatives, verbs with -e and -agi
largely occur in object voice. That is, in the overwhelming majority of non-
causative cases, -e and -agi occur when a location, goal, beneficiary, instrument,
or subject matter argument is subject. This is comparable to the function of ac-
tor voice and object voice: they indicate what the thematic role of the subject is
or is not. In a similar way, in most instances -e and -agi actually serve to indi-
cate the role of the subject not the object. Textual evidence follows.
       In connected discourse, such as the narrative texts in Chapter 16, the dis-
tribution of actor voice and object voice fluctuates between roughly 50/50 to a
40/60 split with object voice verbs predominating. For example, in the story Ke
Moko, the raw count in transitive clauses is 50 actor voice and 64 object voice,
roughly a 44/56 ratio. As the repeated use of a particular verb in a given text
may skew the results, this potentially confounding effect can be factored out by
considering only the number of distinct verbs used in each voice; in Ke Moko
doing so changes the counts to 27 actor voice and 41 object voice, roughly a
40/60 ratio. If use of -e and -agi were unrelated to subject selection, the ratio of
actor voice/object voice for -e and the ratio of actor voice/object voice for -agi
should be similar to the general actor voice/object voice ratio. In Ke Moko this
appears to be true of -e, which has a raw count of 4 actor voice and 5 object
voice. However, it is not true of -agi. Verbs with the -agi suffix occur in 1 actor
voice clause and 14 object voice clauses. Of the 15 tokens, 2 are causative, in-
cluding the lone instance of actor voice. Given the relatively small number of
tokens, any one text might not be representative. The results for an additional
three stories is given in (170), along with the results for Ke Moko. (170)            actor voice      object voice          -e               -agi

in Ke Moko. The numbers of -e and -agi verbs show more fluctuation. However,
the results taken together clearly indicate that a large majority of the -e and -agi
332    Chapter 10 Modifications to argument structure
verbs occur in the object voice, thus indicating that an important if not principal
function of -e and -agi is, in fact, in service of identifying the role of the subject.
Viewed this way, -e and -agi appear to be part of the same morphological sys-
tem as actor voice and object voice. And the function of them all combined
parallels the role of voice morphology in western Austronesian languages, iden-
tifying the subject (or topic or focus) of a clause.
       It is also the case that the distribution of Madurese voice (+ applicative)
morphology can be quite similar to that of Philippine languages. A comparison
of the relative occurrence of actor voice, object voice, and object voice + appli-
cative morphology reported in Davies 2005 demonstrated that the pattern of
distribution was quite comparable to that reported for Cebuano in Bell 1988.
The comparison is given in (171). (The terminology for Cebuano voice catego-
ries is that used in Bell 1988. It differs somewhat from Schachter’s 1976 termi-
nology for Tagalog, which is the terminology most widely used in the literature
on Philippine languages.) (171)       Cebuano voice distribution             Madurese voice distribution

             Agent-topic               50.7%        Actor voice              48.0%

             Total goal-topic          49.3%        Total object voice       52.0%In (171), the object voice number (38.3%) reported for Madurese excludes ob-
ject voice used with -e and -agi, and the -e and -agi categories represent those
instances of -e and -agi combined with object voice. The ‘total object voice’
category combines object voice, -e and -agi, which is comparable to Bell’s cov-
er term ‘goal-topic’, the category comprised of all the non-agent-topic instances
of voice morphology. As is clear from this table, as well as the figures for the
Madurese texts given in (170), the combined effect of object voice and the ap-
plicative affixes is quite similar to Bell’s tallies for Cebuano. Clearly, the statis-
tics and their comparison is neither rigorous nor definitive. However, the re-
markably similarity across the two languages is suggestive. The applicative
morphology together with the voice morphology give a result quite like that of
the richer voice systems found in some other Western Austronesian languages.
       Despite this suggestion, it is clear that treating the -agi suffix as a part of
the voice system of Madurese is no closer to providing a unified analysis than

any other account. There are instances of the suffix that clearly do not conform
to such an analysis. As shown in section 2.1, -agi can occur when the benefi-
ciary is not linked to any core argument position but remains a prepositional
object, as in (83), repeated here.","[345, 346, 347, 348, 349, 350]"

second, and third persons, some of which are derived forms or at least expres-
sions that serve additional purposes. There is dialectal variation in the inventory
of forms, which I will not attempt to sort out here.1 The basic forms for the
three persons are:(66) sengko', engko', aba' ‘I’

third person forms are comprised of possessed forms of aba' ‘body, soul’ and
dibi' ‘only, sole’. The multiple forms for second and third persons are dialectal
and stylistic variants, the most standard forms being ba'na ‘you’ and aba'na
‘he/she’. Additionally, there are a large number of first and second person forms
that are used in the higher speech levels. The forms are given here, but their use
is detailed in Chapter 15.(67) 1st person                     2nd person

form them. However, there are two strategies for indicating plurality with pro-
nouns. One is the reduplicated form of aba', ba'-aba'. This form is a general
plural pronoun that can be used for all persons; the context in which it occurs

determines whether it is to be interpreted as first, second, or third person. The
alternative is to combine the appropriate pronoun with the quantifier kabbi ‘all’,
as in (68).(68) sengko' kabbi ‘we’
     ba'na kabbi ‘you’
     aba'na kabbi ‘they’       As there is no case marking on NPs in Madurese, with the exception of
the first person singular possessive, the same pronominal forms are used for any
grammatical role. The sentences in (69-72) illustrate.(69) a. Sengko' entar dha' Lombok.

        ‘I went to Lombok.’     b. Ba'na melle buku.

84 Chapter 3 Lexical categories       Finally, as is true of many languages in the area, personal names and
terms of address can serve as pronouns. For example, the sentence in (73) can
unexceptionally be uttered by the narrator in reference to himself as he tells a
story, and thus is translated here in the first person.","[98, 99, 100, 101]"
"1.4. Precategorial rootsThe issue of precategorial roots was touched on above. A precategorial root is a
lexical root that can function syntactically as either a noun or a verb with no
derivational morphology. Inflectional morphology associated both with verbs,
e.g. agreement and tense morphology, and with nouns, e.g. case and number
morphology, is directly applicable to the root. Madurese contains a modest
number of roots that exhibit this property, illustrated previously with the root
tokol ‘hammer’. This most frequently and obviously presents itself in the case
of roots that one might most naturally consider noun roots, including instrumen-
tal concepts such as are' ‘scythe’, pacol ‘hoe’, kaca ‘glass/mirror’, jala ‘net’,
sapo ‘broom’ and others, occupations and work locations such as tokang ‘arti-
san’, tane ‘farm’, warung ‘small shop’ and others, and various other roots.
When used as declarative verbs, these roots invariably take an actor voice pre-
fix, either ng- (which is subject to assimilation) or a-. Examples are given in
(41-43).14(41) a. Kaca jarowa bassa.
        glass that    broken
        ‘That mirror broke.’14
  If one were to take these as noun roots, the prefixation of the actor voice could be
characterized as deriving a verb with a meaning something like ‘do an appropriate ac-
tivity with N’. If one were to take them as verb roots, the derivation from verb to noun
would simply be conversion with the meaning ‘thing used to V’. The former seems
more likely than the latter, but ultimately the issue is not particularly significant.

purely inflectional. Some morphemes appear to be principally inflectional mor-
phemes but at times seem to act derivationally, e.g. the locative -e. (See Chapter
4.) Some roots satisfy the criteria for precategoriality yet because of their deno-
tation and their standard use can reasonably be classified as noun roots (which,
of course, might be asserted regarding the instrumental and locative roots just
discussed). Among these are:(44) bine ‘wife’                   a-bine ‘marry a woman’
     ale' ‘younger sibling’        a-ale' ‘call someone younger sibling’
     bapa' ‘father’                a -bapa' ‘call someone father’
     sapedha ‘bicycle’             a-sapedha ‘ride a bicycle’
     kaos ‘t-shirt’                a-kaos ‘wear a t-shirt’These are potentially cases in which the actor voice morphology is working
derivationally. Alternatively, these could be instances of conversion or zero
derivation in which the noun root, say bine, becomes a derived verb and then
takes the voice morphology in its role as predicate. Regardless, the number of
precategorial roots in Madurese does not seem to be significant and they do not
play any crucial role in the grammar.
78 Chapter 3 Lexical categories2. Closed class categories2.1. Adverbs: straddling the open/closed dichotomyAdverb straddles the line between open and closed lexical classes. Many ele-
ments that modify the clause, verb phrase or adjective are derived forms, largely
with adjectival roots. Nonetheless, there are a number of forms which serve
exclusively as adverbs and are equipped with no derivational morphology. Al-
though most, if not all, manner adverbs are derived, there are temporal, epistem-
ic, frequency, and degree adverbs that are not.","[93, 94, 95]"
"
3. PronounsPronominal forms can constitute an NP or the head of an NP. The familiar
speech level has a limited set of pronouns (see Chapter 3 section 2.4). First,
second, and third person are distinguished, although the second and third per-
sons are derived forms.
                                                                  Pronouns 185
(15) sengko', engko', aba' ‘I’
     ba'na, ba'en, ba'eng, kake, sedha ‘you’1
     aba'na, aba'eng, dibi'na, dibi'eng ‘he/she’The noun root aba' ‘body’ (cognate with Javanese awak) forms the stem for
second and some third person forms. The most common form for second person
is the shortened stem ba' with the definite suffix -na. In Western Madura, the
form is ba'eng, following the rule that replaces -na with the allomorph -eng
following a glottal stop. The form ba'en also is used in Central Madura, in the
areas near Sampang and Pamekasan (Sutoko, Soegianto, Surani, Sariono, and
Suyanto 1998; Pawitra 2009). Additionally, the third person forms aba'na and
aba'eng are also frequently used for second person (16). The dominant third
person forms are aba'na and aba'eng. Dibi'na and dibi'eng, derived from the
root dibi' ‘alone’, are also used but to a somewhat lesser extent, illustrated in
(17). Additionally, as (18) and (19) demonstrate, the word aba' can serve as a
pronoun on its own. In each case here, aba' is used to designate the speaker.","[201, 202]"

     ‘I now understand this princess, that you are truly not guilty.’Each of these examples is taken from a dialogue between a princess and the
minister instructed by her father to kill her. First person is expressed by both
dalem and kaula and second person by ajunan and panjennengngan. See Chap-
ter 15 for discussion of the use of these pronouns and other aspects of the higher
speech levels.
       Finally, proper names and titles can also be used pronominally. Thus,
under appropriate circumstances, the sentence in (34) can be uttered by Hanina
in reference to herself.

     ‘Tomorrow I am going to Jakarta.’3.1. Distribution of pronounsContext plays a role not only in interpreting pronouns, but also in the distribu-
tion of pronouns. Pronouns in prepositional phrases and coordinate structures
are obligatory, but subject, object, non-prepositional agent, and possessive pro-
nouns are optional. In fact, as is the case in many languages that allow them,
null pronouns are generally preferred when sanctioned. Thus, the sentences in
(35-37), all taken from narratives, have the interpretations ascribed to them in
the context of that narrative. (In the examples, pro occurs in the canonical posi-
tion of a pronoun or NP.)(35) Dhang-kadhang pro1 e-sambi pro2 keya dha’ pro1 e-bagi pro2 dha’ 
     sometimes           OV-bring       too to        OV-give    to

     ‘After a while the minister came and saw him.’(37) Mole    dha' disa-na     pro!
     go.home to village-DEF
     ‘Go home to your villages!’In (35), null pronouns take the place of subjects pro1 and post-verbal agents
pro2. In (36), the direct object of ngatela ‘see’ is a null pronoun. And in (37),
the null pronoun fills the position of the possessor. Pronominal anaphora as well
as reflexives and reciprocals are treated in detail in Chapter 13.","[205, 206]"
"(81) Inai e-kera (bi') Siti ja’ ___i mangkat ka Jakarta are Kemmes.

                                                 Cross-clausal null anaphora 435
In (81) the complement subject is coreferential with the matrix subject, in (82)
the complement post-verbal agent is coreferential with the matrix object, and in
(83) the possessor of the object of the complement clause is coreferential with
the object. As indicated in the examples, the null element is actually a null pro-
noun. Evidence for this is that an overt pronoun can occur instead, which is
fairly standard with objects and obligatory in the case of prepositional objects.
Details of the structure are given in Chapter 11 section 6.
       A final instance of cross-clausal anaphora is control into adverbial claus-
es. Although cross-clausal dependency is not obligatory in most cases, the sub-
ject of an adverbial clause is frequently a null pronoun coreferential with an
argument in the matrix clause. This is illustrated in (84-87), in which the adver-
bial clauses are marked with brackets.","[451, 452]"
"(6)    Siti badha e kantor otaba (aba'na) entar ka stasiun.
       Siti exist at office or        she     go     to station
       ‘Siti is at the office or she went to the station.’(7)    Apa Ali a-lako otaba (aba'na) tedhung?
       what Ali AV-work or        he sleep
       ‘Is Ali working or sleeping?’As indicated in (6) and (7), and as is true of all coordinated clauses, if the sub-
jects are shared by the two clauses, the second of the two is omissible. In this
case, it may be that verb phrases rather than clauses are coordinated (see section
1.1).1 However, null pronouns, especially subjects, are widespread throughout
the language, so the structure is compatible with either analysis.
       Contradiction or contrary to expectation is indicated with the coordinating
conjunction tape ‘but’.",[353]
"(35) Kopi reya manes gallu.
     coffee this sweet too
     ‘This coffee is too sweet.’
2. Derivation of adverbsAs the data in section 1.1 amply illustrate, a number of regular processes are at
work in the derivation of adverbial expressions.
       A great many temporal expressions are simply the nouns associated with
time. The nouns associated with time of day, time periods, names of days of the
week and months, and specific dates are all nominal expressions that assume an
adverbial function. Other temporal expressions are also nominal. The chief
means of derivation is the sa-...-na structure. As illustrated in section 1.1, a
verbal, adverbial or nominal root occurs in the structure sa-...-na to denote such
relative temporal relations as ‘before’ (sabellunna) and ‘after’ (samarena) and
‘when’ (sabaktona). With some expressions sa can be dropped, so marena and
baktona are commonly used as is the underived form bakto.
       Many adjectival predicates can be used in root form, especially in the case
of manner adverbials and epistemic expressions. Thus, an adjective such as
ceppet ‘fast’ can be used both as a predicate (36) and as a manner adverbial
(37).",[414]
"4.3. Transitive clausesDynamic transitive verbs are both semantically and syntactically transitive in
their active form. Semantically they can largely be characterized as those predi-
cates which take an actor argument (that which initiates or carries out the action,
prototypically an agent) and a theme (that which is affected by the action, proto-
typically a patient). Syntactically, the basic order in a transitive clause is subject
- verb - object, the object taking neither prepositional nor case marking. Mor-
phologically, the verb obligatorily takes actor voice marking in the active,
which in other works is taken to be the neutral form and which is what is of-
fered by speakers in direct elicitation situations. The sentences in (77-80) illu-
strate.",[179]
"The English construction is akin to what has been referred to by Higgins (1981)
as ‘prolepsis’ in Zacapoaxtla Nahuat and in Ancient Greek and Latin, in which
an apparent nonthematic object in the matrix clause anticipates the referent of
that object as a thematic argument of the embedded clause. Examination of the
Madurese structures indicates many differences between sentences such as
(98b) and (99b) and the grammatical properties generally cited as characteristic
of raising structures but points to similarities between the Madurese and prolep-
sis structures.
       The structures in the a-sentences and the b-sentences have obvious differ-
ences inasmuch as the matrix verb is in actor voice in one and object voice in
the other. This not a necessity for the prolepsis structure, however. Although a
subtle difference, (102b) is a prolepsis structure while (102a) is not.(102) a. Siti ngera      ja' Ina mangkat ka Jakarta are Kemmes.
         Siti AV.think COMP Ina leave        to Jakarta day Thursday
         ‘Siti thinks that Ina left for Jakarta on Thursday.’     b. Siti ngera     Ina ja' mangkat ka Jakarta are Kemmes.
        Siti AV.think Ina COMP leave       to Jakarta day Thursday
        ‘Siti thinks about Ina that she left for Jakarta on Thursday.’The only difference between the two structures is that in (102a), the basic struc-
ture, the complement subject Ina, follows the complementizer ja' while in
(102b) Ina precedes ja'. However, the verb kera ‘think’ is exceptional in that it
has precisely the same form in the basic and prolepsis structures. In all other
cases, the matrix verb has additional morphology, either the locative -e suffix or
the -agi suffix in the prolepsis structures. The b-sentences are translated here as
instances of prolepsis.(103) a. Guru-na     yaken Bambang bakal lulus ujiyan.
         teacher-DEF sure Bambang will pass exam
         ‘The teacher is sure Bambang will pass the exam.’
                                                                     Prolepsis 359
     b. Guru-na     ng-yaken-ne Bambang ja' bakal lulus ujiyan.
        teacher-DEF AV-sure-LOC Bambang COMP will pass exam
        ‘The teacher is sure about Bambang that he will pass the exam.’(104) a. Ina a-bala ka Ebu' ja' Nabun a-berri' konce juwa
         Ina AV-say to mother COMP Nabun AV-give key that
         dha' Sa'diyah.
         to Sa'diyah
         ‘Ina said to Mother that Nabun gave the key to Sa'diyah.’     b. Ina a-bala'-agi Nabun ka Ebu'    ja' a-berri' konce juwa
        Ina AV-say-AGI Nabun to mother COMP AV-give key that
        dha' Sa'diyah.
        to Sa'diyah
        ‘Ina said about Nabun to mother that she gave the key to Sa'diyah.’In (103b), the locative suffix -ne and concomitant actor voice marking indicate
that Bambang is a matrix dependent, differentiating it from the embedding con-
struction in (103a). And in (104b), the suffix -agi in and the fact that Nabun
precedes a matrix clause argument, ka Ebu' ‘to mother’, indicate that Nabun is a
matrix dependent, unlike (104a). So, the basic embedding structure is distin-
guishable from the prolepsis structure on the basis of word order and morpholo-
gy.
       The suffixal morphology has the same function here as it does elsewhere.
As described in Chapter 10, -e and -agi indicate that what is a prepositional
argument in basic structure has been selected as a core argument: the locative
suffix indicating that a goal is a core argument and -agi indicating that a bene-
factive argument, instrumental argument, subject matter argument and so on is a
core argument. There are synonymous sentences in which the additional matrix
dependent in the b-sentences occurs in a prepositional phrase. The sentence in
(105) is synonymous with (103b).","[375, 376]"
"(25) Sengko' bi' kake salamet.
     I       with you safe
     ‘We are safe.’Further, Pawitra (2009) cites engko' ban ba'na kabbi as a first person exclusive
form (equivalent to Indonesian kami) and engko' ban sakabbina bareng as an
inclusive form (equivalent to Indonesian kita).
      As an alternative, it is possible to simply use the singular form of the pro-
                                                                     Pronouns 187
noun to signify the plural. Pronouns are thus no different from regular noun
heads regarding inflecting for number. As shown in section 2.1, while common
nouns can be inflected for number through reduplication, this reduplication is
largely optional in actual usage. Whether a given NP is singular or plural is
sorted out through the discourse. The same is true of the pronouns in the follow-
ing sentences, all of which clearly stand for plural entities given the context of
the narratives in which they were uttered.","[203, 204]"

     two bodies.’
5. PossessionAs described in Chapter 3 section 2.4, except for first person singular, which
has a special pronominal form tang/sang, possession is typically indicated by
the affixation of the definite suffix -na followed by a nominal denoting the pos-
sessor, which may be overt or null (when the referent is recoverable from the
discourse context). The first person singular possessive pronoun is exemplified
in (57), and other instances of possession marked in the NP are in (58) - (59).2(57) Tang bapa' entar ka Bandung.
     my father go      to Bandung
     ‘My father went to Bandung.’(58) Sengko' lo' maca buku-na ba'eng.
     I       not AV.read book-DEF you
     ‘I haven’t read your book.’

 Speakers sometimes regularize first person possession, using sengko' ‘I’ with the defi-
nite suffix, giving forms such as bapa'na senko' 'my father'.
194 Chapter 7 Nominals and noun phrases(59) Roma-na guru ce' raja-na.
     house-DEF teacher very big-DEF
     ‘The teacher’s house is very large.’Except for the first person possessive pronoun, which precedes the possessed
noun (57), possessors follow the noun they possess, as in (58), where ba'eng
‘you’ follows buku ‘book’, and (59), in which guru ‘teacher’ follows the head
noun roma ‘house’. In all instances of non-first person possession marked in an
NP, the definite suffix is obligatory.
      Clause level possessive constructions are treated in Chapter 6.","[210, 211]"

"
2. Use of the vocabulariesIt is often the case that the manner in which a system is designed to function and
the way in which that system is implemented do not match perfectly. This is
true of the specialized vocabularies of Madurese. However, in this section, the
appropriate use of the various vocabularies is presented in an idealized manner.
Discussion of the ways that actual use diverged from the ideal and are used
today is taken up in section 2.",[490]
"
3. Complex locative expressionsAs is true of Indonesian, Javanese, and the other Indonesian-type languages,
Madurese contains a set of locative nouns which combine with the basic loca-
242 Chapter 8 Prepositions and PPstive prepositions to denote various locations, this in lieu of a large number of
locative prepositions as found in many other languages. The set includes:(91) adha' ‘front’
     antara ‘between, gap’
     attas ‘top, above’
     baba ‘bottom, underneath’
     budhi ‘behind, back’
     dhalem ‘inside’
     ereng ‘side’
     lowar ‘outside’
     seddi' ‘side’
     semma' ‘close’In the general case, these locative nouns combine with one of the basic locative
prepositions e/neng ‘at’, dha'/ka ‘to’, and dhari ‘from’. And the complex prepo-
sitions or complex locative expressions largely take the following form:(92) locative P + locative N + na + objectThe following illustrate the pattern:(93) a. neng attas-sa meja               ‘on the table’
     b. e antara-na ku-buku juwa         ‘between those books’The locative noun + na + object actually constitute a possessive construction
with the object as possessor. The parallel between the PPs in (93) and (94) is
clear.(94) a. neng bengko-na Bu’ Yus           ‘at Bu Yus’s house’
     b. e kantor-ra Bapa'                ‘at father’s office’The complex locative expressions can thus be more literally translated as ‘on
the table’s top’ and ‘at the those books’ gap’. The examples in sentences (95-
98) illustrate the same pattern.","[258, 259]"

2. Derived prepositionsA number of elements used prepositionally are derived forms of other lexical
items. In some instances, although historically they are derived forms, they have
become indivisible lexical items which have taken on special meanings. Most of
the derivations include overt morphology, but in some cases only the root form
of the verb or noun is used.2.1. kaangguy ‘for’Kaangguy is the resultive/abilitive form of angguy ‘use’, signaled by the ka-

     sanga' bulan or sangang bulan ‘nine months’The numbers 1, 2, 4, and 6 have truncated clitic forms. And only the number 4
retains its final glottal stop as a clitic. The final glottal stop is dropped in all of
the other numbers that have it. The final glottal stop in the citation forms and
the abbreviated forms is what Stevens (1968) refers to as an ‘extension’, a mi-
nor morphological category of limited membership, which in this case has no
effect on meaning but may be phonologically motivated. (See Chapter 4 section
3 for a discussion of extensions.) Unlike the numbers 3 and 5, the clitics of the
numbers 7-9 include a velar nasal ligature. This ligature does not occur in other
positions. While using either the full or clitic form prenominally is fully accept-
able, speakers generally use the clitic forms, particularly with 1 and 2.
       Numbers can also follow the noun they modify, although this possibility
varies among speakers. For some speakers, the number can follow the quanti-
fied noun without any modification. As in the examples in (83-85).","[216, 217]"

lar because the quality of the Madurese vowel is conditioned by a rule of vowel
raising in which high vowels occur after aspirated and voiced stops and mid and
low vowels elsewhere. (The process and the limited exceptions are discussed
more fully in section 4). Because the surface form is more revealing in the case
of vowels, phonetic representations of Madurese and Indonesian are compared
here. These correspondences include instances in which Madurese has a mid
vowel because of the preceding conditioning environment. So, in some cases
the high vowel of the Indonesian corresponds to a mid vowel in the Madurese
cognate.",[40]

 A debate has sprung up surrounding Foley’s proposal. Some such as Kroeger (1998)
and Himmelmann (2007) argue that noun and verb are important categorial distinctions
in Philippine languages while acknowledging the unusual nature of lexical items in
these languages.
62 Chapter 3 Lexical categories1. Open class categoriesAs stated above, determining how many major lexical classes to recognize is
not always a straightforward task. There are some lexical roots that can appear
in a nominal syntactic frame or a verbal syntactic frame without any obvious
derivational morphology. An example is given in (1).(1) a. Sengko' adhi' tokol.
       I        have hammer
       ‘I have a hammer.’      b. Tokol kaju rowa!
         hammer wood that
         ‘Hammer that board!’In (1a) tokol ‘hammer’ is used nominally, an object that can be possessed. In
(1b) tokol occurs as the imperative verb in precisely the same form. Thus, based
solely on these sentences, it is impossible to determine whether tokol is a noun
root or a verb root. Of course, one can say exactly the same of the word ‘ham-
mer’ in the English sentences in the translations. Thus, this particular example
is not very revealing. However, leaving aside potentially precategorial roots
(which are taken up in section 1.4), establishing a distinction between nouns
and verbs (and adjectives) is relatively straightforward.","[78, 79]"

  As homophony and polysemy can be relatively difficult to sort out in this context,
whether a particular form is properly one or the other will be left an open question here
to focus on other aspects of morphology.

1.1. Verbal morphologyOne of the most salient properties of Madurese morphology is the voice system,
morphology that indicates the relationship of thematic roles and grammatical
functions. Madurese voice is discussed in detail in Chapter 9. The purpose here
is to simply present the morphological manifestations.","[115, 116]"
"(37) Ebu' maca buku.
     mother AV.read book
     ‘Mother reads a book.’(38) Ebu' entar dha' Sorbaja.
     mother go    to Surabaya
     ‘Mother goes to Surabaya.’Also, distinctions must be made between active and stative semantically transi-
tive roots on similar morphological and syntactic grounds.
       The morphological and syntactic differences between adjectives and other
verbal roots likely have an explanation in semantics. The adjective-like lexical
items in question describe properties, properties such as size (raja ‘big’), per-
sonal characteristic (penter ‘smart’), dimension (koros ‘skinny’) and so on. Theage arrived’. However, not all speakers will accept sentences in which the subject is not
marked definite, quantified, or possessed. As NPs, these collocations are unacceptable.
13
   As detailed in Chapters 7 and 11, attributive adjectives such as raja ‘large’, koros
‘thin’, and penter ‘smart’ can also modify nouns as the predicate in a relative clause,
just as in English. So synonymous NPs would be bengko se raja ‘house that is large’,
koceng se koros ‘cat that is skinny’, and mored se penter ‘student that is smart’.

reason that only these types of lexical items can occur in comparative and su-
perlative constructions while dynamic verbs cannot may be that properties are
the only type concept that can be compared. If this is the appropriate explana-
tion, the category adjective may be unnecessary. Adjectives may simply com-
prise a subcategory of verbs–’intransitive stative verbs’. In fact, adjectival pre-
dicates and intransitive dynamic verbs such as entar ‘go’, elang ‘disappear’,
kerem ‘sink’, labu ‘fall’ and a host of others share a property that distinguishes
them from most other verbs, including intransitive agentive verbs such as jalan
‘walk’, langoy ‘swim’ and others: they both lack any voice marking in their
basic use.(39) a. Mored reya penter.
        student this smart
        ‘This student is smart.’     b. Bengko rowa raja.
        house that big
        ‘That house is big.’(40) a. Mored rowa entar.
        student that go
        ‘That student goes.’     b. Parao rowa kerem.
        ship that sink
        ‘That ship sank.’As discussed in Chapter 9, most other intransitive and transitive verbs must be
marked for voice in non-imperative sentences.
       Adjectives, therefore, can be viewed as one kind of intransitive–
intransitive stative verbs–as opposed to the class of intransitive dynamic verbs.
Conceivably, the same semantic difference between these two classes of intran-
sitive verbs could account for the facts surrounding the ce’ X-na intensive con-
struction. Again, properties may simply be more amenable to this type of quan-
tification than are dynamic expressions.
       However, there still remains the distributional property of noun modifica-
tion. Recall that only adjectives (or ‘intransitive stative verbs’) can directly
modify nouns. Other verbs cannot be used attributively but only predicatively.
Whether this can be explained solely in terms of the semantics of the verbs in
question is unclear. It has been argued that verb roots can be used in this way in
other related languages. For example, Klamer (1998) argues against a distinct
category adjective in Kambera, a language spoken on Sumba in central Indone-
sia, in part because many Kambera verbs can be used as attributive nominal
76 Chapter 3 Lexical categoriesmodifiers.
       In the end the issue could well boil down to whether one is predisposed to
recognize a lexical class of adjectives wholly distinct from verbs. Those who do
may cite the properties illustrated above as evidence. Those who do not must
recognize a subcategory of verbs, stative intransitive verbs, which differ from
other intransitive verbs on the basis of these same properties. The evidence on
either side is equivocal, but theoretical parsimony favors dispensing with the
additional category. Taking a somewhat jaundiced view, one might agree with
Croft (2005: 435), “Since everyone is selective for their own opportunistic theo-
retical reasons, debates on whether there are languages with a “noun”/”verb”
distinction, or languages without “adjectives”, cannot ever be resolved.” De-
spite the conclusion that adjectives should be considered a subcategory of verb
and not a wholly distinct lexical class, I will continue to refer to some lexical
items as ‘adjectives’ for ease of identification.","[91, 92, 93]"

8. OrthographyA number of writing systems have been used for Madurese over the years. Few
have proven completely satisfactory for representing the variety of sounds in the
language. Some have been more phonemically based but the majority take into
account some of the results of the phonological rules outlined above.
      Initially, Madurese was written in the kawi syllabary used to write Java-
nese. Like a number of the writing systems to follow, the Javanese syllabary
was not entirely satisfactory. Because Madurese contains three series of stops
(voiceless, voiceless aspirated, and voiced) and Javanese contains only two
(voiceless and so-called breathy), the Javanese syllabary does not include a suf-
52 Chapter 2 Phonologyficient number of symbols to represent this three-way contrast. Additionally, the
vowel inventories of the two languages do not match, so the appropriate sym-
bols were not available for every consonant-vowel combination. Most of the
alphabetic systems that followed pretty much suffered from the same lack of
symbols.
       An exception is the Roman script alphabet devised by Kiliaan, who used
it in his grammar (1897) and dictionary (1904), based on the system introduced
for Javanese, Indonesian and other languages of Indonesia. This alphabet did
capture the three-way phonation contrast for stops: voiceless stops and voiced
stops were represented by the typical symbols. Aspirated stops were represented
in two-letter sequences of the voiced stop followed by h. So, [p] was
represented as bh, [] as dh, and so on. The retroflex stops were distinguished
from the dental stops as is customary in many phonetic transcriptions schemes,
using a diacritic below the stop symbol; so, [ṭ], [ṭ], and [ḍ] were represented as
ṭ, ḍh, and ḍ, respectively. The complete inventory of consonant symbols was:(72) Orthography of the Colonial Period    sound       symbol                       symbol

     ə           e
     u           oe
     ɔ           o       In 1973, there was a meeting of scholars in Pamekasan, the purpose of
which was to establish a standard orthography for Madurese. This orthography
is used in the chapters that follow. A decision was made to adopt a system that
paralleled the official spelling system used for Bahasa Indonesia and generally
accepted for Javanese. Like Javanese, Indonesian has only a two-way phona-
tion contrast for stops (voiceless and voiced). Therefore, the same dilemma is
faced regarding the representation of the aspirated series of stops. Unlike Indo-
nesian, Javanese includes a set of retroflex stops in addition to the dental-
alveolar stops. The standard orthography for Javanese represents the retroflex
stops with the symbols th and dh. This convention was adopted in setting the
standard for Madurese. As dh was adopted for the voiced retroflex stop, the di-
graph dh (used in the Dutch system) was unavailable for [], and consequently
the digraphs with h were not available for any of the aspirated stops. Further-
more, no symbols were adopted that required special typesetting or keystrokes.
The result is a system in which the voiceless aspirated stops are represented
with the same symbols as their voiced counterparts; thus aspiration is not
represented in the orthography and can lead to confusion. So, for example, b
represents both [b] and [p].
       Similarly, not all differences in vowel quality are represented in this sys-
tem. Adhering to a principle of no diacritics or unusual symbols, [ɛ] and [ə] are
represented by the symbol e. This parallels the use of e to represent [e] and [ə]
in the Indonesian standard orthography. (Occasionally è is used to represent [ɛ]
to orthographically distinguish it from [ə], as is done for Javanese. But this is
not the normal practice.) Additionally, a is used for both [a] and [ɤ]. The other
vowels each take a different orthographic symbol. The potential for ambiguity
between a and e is reduced to varying degrees because of some distributional
regularities of [ɤ] and [ə]. First, as discussed above, [ɤ] is not phonemic and its
distribution is predictable: without exception, it occurs only following voiceless
aspirated and voiced stops and in the appropriate environment following a
transparent consonant ([r], [l], [w], [j]). [ɤ] never occurs as a non-alternating
vowel. Thus, it is transparent that the a’s in maca, the actor voice form for
54 Chapter 2 Phonology‘read’, are pronounced as [a] [maca], as well as in kata’ ‘frog’ [kata]. Given
the relatively small number of ‘non-alternating’ vowels, it is also the case that
most a’s following the orthographic symbols b, d, dh, j, and g represent [ɤ], as
in badha ‘exist’ [bɤḍɤ] and jaga ‘awake’ [cɤkɤ].
       With respect to e, the ambiguity is more difficult to resolve. However, as
[] occurs only in closed syllables (which can trigger gemination at morpheme
boundaries), when e occurs in an open syllable it unambiguously signals a pho-
nemic //. This is illustrated in the following, in which all e’s represent phonem-
ic //: meja ‘table’, pote ‘white’, kene ‘now’. Additionally, given the vowel al-
ternations, when e follows b, d, dh, j, or g, in the vast majority of cases (that is
barring a non-alternating vowel) it represents [ə], as in beddel ‘soak’, dhekdhek
‘bran’, jejjel ‘crammed, crowded’. However, in other closed-syllable environ-
ments, e may represent [ɛ] or [ə]. For example, in kenneng ‘get, hit’ the e of the
first syllable is [ə] and that of the second [ɛ] [kənnɛ], while in senneng ‘happy’
both are [ə] [sənnə], and in pennes ‘pocket knife’ both are [ɛ] [pɛnnɛs]. This
dual use of e can result in some minimal pairs (and near minimal pairs) taking
the same orthographic representation, such as kenneng which represents both
[kənnɛ] ‘get, hit’ and [kənnə] ‘place’, kerem which represents both [kɛrɛm]
‘send’ and [kɛrəm] ‘sink’, and pancer which represents both [pancər] ‘rudder’
and [pancɛr] ‘heel, rim’. Of course, while a completely phonetic alphabet is in
some ways desirable, for the native speaker of the language this alphabet need
not pose any particular problems. Safioedin (1977) adopts this standard in his
dictionary, which is given in (73).

        ɔ           o      In some recent work, Indonesian linguists have employed a system remi-
niscent of the Dutch spelling system in some ways. Aspirated consonants are
transcribed as bh, dh, and so on, but except for one case, the retroflex stops are
not distinguished from the dental series. What follows are the orthographies
used in a number of recent (except in the case of Asmoro) works on Madurese,
including the 1973 official system used in Safioedin 1977.

Of these systems, the orthography used by Zainudin et al. (1978) captures the
most phonemic and phonetic distinctions, conflating only the dental and retrof-
lex stops.
       All of the romanized systems are heavily phonetic, with the exception of
those graphemes that are used for more than one sound. That is, for the most
part epenthesis, deletion, assimilation, and vowel color processes deriving sur-
face forms are reflected in the orthography, as these forms do not obscure or
confuse any phonemic contrasts. For example, sorat is the unaffixed root for
‘letter’ as it appears in a noun phrase such as sorat rowa ‘that’ letter’. With the
definite suffix -na, it is written as soradda as in soradda ebu ‘mother’s letter’,
reflecting both the gemination and aspiration processes that derive the surface
form. A few examples of such surface forms are given below. All examples are
taken from Imron (1979) as one of the few longer texts using the 1973 ortho-
graphy, and applying it very consistently.(75) ‘base’ form        affixed form            phonological process(es)      nyare ‘seek’      nyare'e ‘seek (DUR)’       -epenthesis

amples are given in (76), again all taken from Imron (1979).

     [bɤɲɲa] ‘many’     bannya’There are some inconsistencies in the reflection of surface forms across differ-
ent orthographies and different publications, but those are just variations. Here
I will adopt the system akin to that used in Imron 1979, in which the phonetic
features discussed above are by and large reflected in the orthography.
       In 2004, a group from Balai Bahasa Surabaya (the Office of Language in
Surabaya) proposed a revised orthography which reinstates distinct symbols for
all consonant sounds and the seven principal vowels that have been recognized
in orthographies (Dradjid 2007). This orthography was adopted as a standard in
December 2008 at the four-day Kongres Bahasa Madura Internasional (Interna-
tional Congress of the Madurese Language) held in Pamekasan under the spon-
sorship of Balai Bahasa Propinsi Jawa Timur (the East Java Province Office of
Language). Pawitra (2009) adopts the new orthography in his recent dictionary.
With some modifications, the orthography essentially adopts the system used
during the colonial period given above in (72). All phonemic distinctions are
captured as well as some phonetic realizations. It diverges from the Dutch sys-
tem by making use of the modern Indonesian conventions for the high back
rounded vowel (u rather than oe), the glottal stop (‘ rather than q), the palatal
glide (y rather than j), the palatal stops (c, jh, and j rather than tj, djh, and dj),
and the palatal nasal (ny rather than nj). The new orthography is given in (78).

often reflected in the spelling, particularly vowel raising, gemination, and aspi-
ration. For the most part glottal stops and glides are not represented at mor-
pheme boundaries nor are some geminates. Examples of the distinction between
the 1973 and 2008 orthographies are exhibited in (79).

tion of the Madurese language. The decision to use the 1973 orthography in this
work is based largely on practical concerns. First, the initial draft of this work
was completed well before the December 2008 Congress, using the then offi-
cially sanctioned spelling system.36 Conversion to the new standard runs the
risk of introducing a significant number of new errors into the this text. Addi-
tionally, while one can be reasonably hopeful that the orthography adopted by
the Congress will indeed be generally adopted, whether or not this turns out to
be the case is unknown at this time. Until the ‘dust settles’, future work will
make use of both orthographies.","[68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77]"

3. Null pronounsAs is true of all Indonesian-type languages and many other languages of the
region, there is widespread use of null pronouns. Null pronouns can find ante-
cedents internal to the sentence they occur in or from the discourse in which
they occur. Null pronouns taking discourse referents can be both subjects and
objects. In the examples that follow, a blank underscore, ___, indicates the posi-
tion in which an overt pronoun would occur.",[448]

      ‘The teacher made the children hold one another’s hands.’The order of nominals following the causative reciprocal verb magu'-teggu'an is

rule of gemination) is used in all cases other than noun stems ending in glottal
stop, and at times in stems with a final glottal stop as well.
       When suffixed to a verb (in the actor voice where appropriate), -na de-
rives a process nominal, as in (49).(49) berka' ‘run’                  berka'na ‘the running’

prefix pa- in combination with -na.
      Definite -na also occurs on elements used as adverbial subordinating con-
junctions, as in the sentences in (50).(50) a. Ita ngejung bakto-na a-ra-kora.

        ‘After Siti had swept the floor, she went to the market.’In (50a), baktona ‘the time’ is interpreted as ‘while’ and in (50b) marena ‘the
finishing’ is interpreted as ‘after’. As shown below in section 1.2.9, the prefix
sa- sometimes combines with -na to form nouns that function as adverbial sub-
ordinating conjunctions.

Bangkalan, its use tapering noticeably around town of Bliga.

"        Returning to the question of the phonemic inventory, there are a number
of lexical items that contain what Stevens (1968) refers to as non-alternating
vowels. These vowels do not follow the general pattern, including cases of high
vowels that follow segments other than voiced and voiceless aspirated stops (or
[l], [r], [], and [s] under the prescribed conditions). Most of these lexical items
are borrowings, predominantly from Arabic, Dutch, English, and Indonesian.
Nonetheless these forms have been fully absorbed into the language. Examples
include:
20
   In the discussion that follows, phonological processes are applied to intermediate
forms, forms which have already undergone the process of Vowel Raising (VR). There-
fore neither phonemic nor phonetic bracketing is used. This is a matter of both clarity
and brevity. For example, the derivation from underlying representation (UR) to surface
representation (SR) is as follows:
(i) UR                   VRaising       Affixation             VRaising/
                                                               Phonetic Realization
       /ɔlɛs/          ---            ɔlɛs + -            ɔlɛsɛ ‘write’
       /gɛbas/      gibɤs             gibɤs + -            [gibɤsi] ‘wave’
Dispensing with the step in which Vowel Raising takes place reduces unnecessary clut-
ter, thus making the phonological process of interest more perspicuous.

       [surgap] ‘conceited’
       [susu] ‘milk’
       [ipəs] ‘typhus’The list includes cases in which high vowels follow voiceless consonants, as in
[buku] ‘book’, [kɔpi] ‘coffee’, [kibik] ‘cubic’, [susu] ‘milk’, and [ipəs]
‘typhus’. There are also instances in which a non-high vowel follows a voiced
stop, such as [ban] ‘tire’, [ba] ‘bank’, [bla] ‘ball’, and [gɔbis] ‘cabbage’. The
only high vowels that are found in such lexical items are [u] and [i]; [ɨ] and [ɤ]
are never found outside the conditioning environment for vowel alternation.
       There is another important difference among [u], [i], [ɨ], and [ɤ]: [u] and
[i] occur word-initially in a small number of lexical items (32), whereas [ɨ] and
[ɤ] never do.(32) [irigɤsi] ‘irrigation’
     [isɛ] ‘troublesome’
     [istimɛwa] ‘special’
     [uijɤn] ‘examination’
     [usul] ‘character’
     [uwɤ] ‘steam’
21
  Often, the forms that have been borrowed from Indonesian have variants with non-
alternating and alternating vowels. Examples include:(i) [susu] ~ [sɔsɔ] ‘milk’
    [tulɛn] ~ [tɔlɛn] ‘pure’
    [tulus] ~ [tɔlɔs] ‘reliable’
                                                 Vowel inventory and distribution 37
In order to account for these instances of [i] and [u] outside the conditioning
environment, they must be posited in underlying representations. It is never ne-
cessary to posit [ɨ] and [ɤ] in underlying representations of lexical items. As the
occurrence of [ɨ] and [ɤ] can always be predicted, there is no need to include
them in the phonemic inventory of the language.
       Having established the vowel harmony (or raising or tensing) process and
the phonemic inventory as the six vowels /ɛ/, /ɔ/, /a/, /ə/, /i/, and /u/, it is clear
this should be reflected in the underlying representations of lexical items. Thus,
we have the following:(33) underlying           surface
     /kɛpa/             [kipɤ] ‘carry’
     /ɛa/          iɤ ‘remain’
     /pəkkəl/            [pəkkɨl] ‘angry’
     /cɔkɔ/             [cukɔ] ‘fish’
     /kɔrɛ/             [kuri] ‘fry’All of the high vowels in the surface forms are derived via the harmony rule. In
words with non-alternating vowels, the surface and underlying forms are iden-
tical. However, in order to focus discussion and make forms maximally transpa-
rent, I include the surface form of the vowels in all roots.
        A final issue regarding the vowel inventory is the status of [] as a surface
vowel. In works such as Stevens (1980, 1994) and Cohn & Lockwood (1994),
eight vowels are posited as being the principle vowels in Madurese, the eight
described above as participating in the vowel alternation. However, other
sources differ on the number of primary vowels. (I use the term ‘primary vo-
wels’ here as the authors tend not to identify the inventories as being phonemic
or phonetic.) Budi et al. (1986/1987) recognize seven vowels, as do Safioedin
(1977) and Zainudin (1978). While there seems to be some conflation of [ə], [ɤ]
and [ɨ] in Budi et al., Safioden (1977), Zainudin (1978), and Pawitra (2009) po-
sit [i], [ɛ], [u], [ɔ], [a], [ə], and [ɤ] (although transcription systems vary some-
what). Moehnilabib (1979) recognizes six vowels, corresponding to the pho-
nemic inventory posited here. Notably absent in all but Stevens and Cohn &
Lockwood is any distinction between [ə] and [ɨ]. And, in fact, no practical or-
thography ever devised for Madurese has ever recognized such a distinction
(see section 8). Those that make use of symbols other than a, e, i, o, u identify
six or seven graphemes but never include a distinct symbol for [].
        What, then, is the status of [ɨ]? It might be recognized for theoretical rea-
sons, i.e. to regularize the system of alternating vowels. However, absent other
evidence, ensuring paradigm uniformity for the alternating vowel system seems
an insufficient justification. There does, however, appear to be some instrumen-
tal evidence for distinguishing [ə] and [ɨ]. Cohn & Lockwood (1994) report that
38 Chapter 2 Phonologythe analysis of recordings of one male and one female speaker from East Madu-
ra indicate the vowel space (based on first and second formants) occupied by [ɨ]
is distinct from that of [ə]. At the same time, the difference in the vowel space
that they report for [ə] and [ɨ] is much less dramatic than the differences for the
other pairs, and indeed there was some overlap in their distribution. The space
occupied by each of the vowels in the other pairs was essentially completely
distinct from its partner. Cohn & Lockwood found little difference in the aver-
age F2s of the pair of vowels but found the difference between the average F1s
to be comparable for [i]/[ɛ], [u]/[ɔ] and [ɨ]/[ə] (the difference in the F1 averages
for [ɤ]/[a] were dramatically higher). In attempting to replicate these results
with a single male speaker from Jember, East Java, Bortscheller (2007) reports a
somewhat more dramatic difference in the vowel space occupied by [ə] and [ɨ].
He also reports a slightly greater difference between the average F1s for [ə] and
[ɨ] than found by Cohn & Lockwood for their male speaker. But again, the dif-
ference in average F1 is comparable to that found with the other pairs of vo-
wels. While not a matter of great urgency, given the instrumental evidence (al-
beit slim), it seems that the distinction should be recognized.","[52, 53, 54, 55]"
"1.3. Reflexive interpretation without dibi'At times, reflexive meaning can also be conveyed without the use of dibi'. This
was shown above for some instances of first and second person reflexives with
aba'. In some instances it is possible or even preferred to simply use the third
person pronominal to denote reflexive meaning. For example, for reasons that
are not currently well understood, some speakers greatly prefer aba'na rather
than aba'na dibi' in the following sentences.4(33) Bambang a-careta ka Hasan bab aba'na.
     Bambang AV-story to Hasan about him
     ‘Bambang talked to Hasan about himself.’4
 Just as the data in the previous section indicate that there is no analog of Principle A at
work in Madurese, the data in this section indicate that there is no analog of Principle B
either, as pronouns can be bound by a c-commanding antecedent in the same clause.
424 Chapter 13 Anaphora(34) Siti e-bala-i     Ita bab aba'na.
     Siti OV-say-LOC Ita about her
     ‘Ita told Siti about herself.’In each instance, aba'na can be replaced by aba'na dibi', at least for some
speakers.
       Additionally, with the appropriate context, it is acceptable for some
speakers to use the pronominal form in some environments in which aba'na
dibi' might be expected. These include:(35) Atin nenggu aba'na neng tifi.
     Atin AV.watch her     on TV
     ‘Atin watched herself on TV.’(36) Rika ngennal-lagi aba'na ka Evi.
     Rika AV.know-AGI her       to Evi
     ‘Rika introduced herself to Evi.’(37) Siti melle permen kaangguy aba'na.
     Siti AV.buy candy for          her
     ‘Siti bought candy for herself.’In each of these instances, aba'na can be replaced by aba'na dibi'. However,
with the appropriate context, in each case, the sentence can be interpreted as
reflexive. Aba'na can also replace aba'na dibi' in the examples in (26-32) with-
out altering the meaning. Thus, aba'na dibi' should not be viewed as a dedicated
reflexive anaphor nor as the sole means of expressing reflexive meaning.5
5
 This is, similar to the facts reported by Cole et al. (2005) for the Mudung Darat and
Tanjung Raden dialects of Jambi Malay. In these dialects, the third person pronoun is
ambiguous between a non-reflexive and reflexive meaning, as in (i).
(i) Jambi Malay (Mudung Darat dialect)
     Dio cinta dio.
     3    love 3
     ‘He loves himself/him.’
While the non-reflexive meaning is preferred, sufficient context allows coreference
between subject and object in (i). When the emphatic particle la occurs with the object
pronoun, both reflexive and non-reflexive interpretations are again possible (ii), in this
instance the reflexive interpretation being preferred.
(ii) Jambi Malay (Mudung Darat dialect)
     Dio cinta sama dio-la.

1.4. NP + dibi' ReflexivesReflexive meaning can also be indicated through the collocation of a proper
noun or NP with dibi'. The sentences in (32-36) illustrate.","[440, 441, 442]"

      ‘Siti thinks that the doctor examined Hasan.’

      dhari Kanada.
      from Canada
      ‘I forgot about Ita that Adi sent a package to her from Canada.’In the case of the direct object (122), the overt pronoun is preferred by most
speakers, and, in the case of the prepositional object (123), the pronoun must be
overt.
       The last feature of note is the interpretation of idioms in the prolepsis
structure. A classic argument for raising has been the fact that chunks of idioms
can retain their idiomatic interpretation, even when raised (e.g., Postal 1974).
Thus, in (124), the cat can retain the idiomatic meaning of ‘secret’ that it has in
the construction the cat is out of the bag (124a), even when it is the matrix
clause subject (124b) or object (124c).(124) a. It seems that the cat is out of the bag.
     b. The cat seems to be out of the bag.
     c. We expect the cat to be out of the bag well before the date of the party.","[380, 381]"

      ‘He was angry and was going to kill her. Even though his daughter had
      apologized to her father, the king was still angry, still going wild.’In the first sentence in (105), there are two instances of the extension n, one in
the transitivized object voice form of duka ‘angry’, and the other in the object
voice form for ‘kill’ in the irrealis, which also occurs as epate'a. In these two
instances, the extension occurs between two vowels, so there may be some pho-
nological explanation for their appearance, despite the fact that they are option-
al.
       The free variation also occurs in the case of -n and certain suffixes. Ver-
bal suffixes ending in phonemic /e/ frequently take this extension, e.g. both the
locative and durative -e and the suffix -agi. Again, at times it seems to be pho-
nologically motivated, to break up a V+V sequence. However, it also occurs
with no apparent phonological conditioning. In neither case is there any effect
on meaning. For example, -n occurs with -agi in the sentences in (106) and
(107).",[143]
"1.3. The (sub)category adjectiveThe last of the open class lexical categories to consider is adjective. It has been
claimed for some Austronesian languages that there is no distinct category ad-
jective, that lexical items denoting what are adjectives in other languages are
part of the category verb (Donohue 1999, Klamer 1998, van den Berg 1989).
And, in fact, Madurese adjectives and verbs share a great many properties,
properties which distinguish them from nouns. Some of these properties are
enumerated in section 1.3.1. Some characteristics that potentially distinguish
them are taken up in section 1.3.2, and the need for a separate category adjec-
tive is evaluated in light of these.",[87]

     electicity-DEF finish die
     ‘The power was off.’ (but it’s on now)As noted in the parenthetical statements in the examples, use of la in the case of
a stative predicate indicates that the state of affairs still obtains: (88) asserts that
the state of the power being off has happened and likely it still the case. On the
other hand, when mare is used in the same environment, the implication is dif-
ferent. Here the implication is that the state of the power being off has obtained,
but that state has already finished; therefore, the power is back on, no longer
off. This has interesting ramifications for the use of these morphemes with re-
spect to the death of animate objects. As mare implies the completion of that
state, and la admits for the continuation of the state, only la is compatible with
mate when the subject is animate. Thus, (92) is grammatical with no special
interpretation.",[288]
"2.6. Numerals and quantifiersMadurese numerals and quantifiers are used both as specifiers in NPs and as
predicates themselves. The numbers 1-9 have full, abbreviated, and clitic forms.(79)                 full             abbreviated            clitic

          9         sanga'            nga'                   sangangThe use of a numeral or its position with respect to the quantified entity deter-
mines which form occurs. While the full forms can be used in counting, it is
more usual for speakers to use the abbreviated forms. Either the full form or the
2
    In the Western dialect, the form sittung also occurs and is preferred by some speakers.
86 Chapter 3 Lexical categoriesclitic form can be used when the numeral precedes the quantified nominal ex-
pression. This is illustrated in (80).(80) settong roma or saroma ‘one house’
     dhuwa' buku or dhu buku ‘two books’
     tello' guru or tello guru ‘three teachers’
     empa' mored or pa' mored ‘ four students’
     lema' buku or lema buku ‘five books’
     ennem sorat or nem sorat ‘six letters’
     petto' toronan or pettong toronan ‘seven generations’
     ballu' liter or ballung liter ‘eight liters’
     sanga' bulan or sangang bulan ‘nine months’The numbers 1, 2, 4, and 6 have truncated clitic forms. And only the number 4
retains its final glottal stop as a clitic. It is dropped in all of the other numbers
that end in glottal stop. The final glottal stop in the citation forms and the ab-
breviated forms is what Stevens (1968) refers to as an ‘extension’, a minor mor-
phological category of limited membership, which in this case has no effect on
meaning but may be phonologically motivated. (See Chapter 4 section 3 for a
discussion of extensions.) Unlike the numbers 3 and 5, the clitics of the num-
bers 7-9 include a velar nasal ligature. This ligature does not occur in other po-
sitions. While using either the full or clitic form prenominally is fully accepta-
ble, speakers generally use the clitic forms, particularly with 1 and 2.
       When the number occurs without an explicit nominal expression or if it
follows the nominal expression that is quantified, only the full form is possible,
as in the examples in (81).(81) a. Nemmo sampe' olle tello'.
        AV.find until  get three
        ‘They could only find three.’     b. Loros kaju e-okor        persis padha bi' se tello'.

        Deni AV-give book five to Tina
        ‘Deni gave five books to Tina.’     d. Mored petto' bakal lulus ujiyan.
        student seven will pass exam
        ‘Seven students will pass the exam.’
                                                            Closed class categories 87
In (81a), tello' ‘three’ quantifies and implicit argument given in the context. In
(81b), tello´ acts as the predicate of a relative clause, se tello' ‘the three’ (literal-
ly ‘those that are 3’). In (81c,d), the numbers follow the quantified expression
and occur in the full form, lema' ‘five’ and petto' ‘seven’, respectively. See
Chapter 7 section 7 for further discussion and illustration.
      The clitic forms are generally, but again not obligatorily, used in numbers
above nine. For example, with polo ‘ten(s)’ standard is sapolo ‘ten’, dhu polo
‘twenty’, sangang polo ‘ninety’, and so on. Some of the higher numbers are
exemplified in (82).(82)     10       sapolo                      30      tello polo

25, 50, and 60. In addition, while 20 takes a predictable form dhupolo (literally
two tens), the numbers 21-24 and 26-29 take the ending lekor (20s). Thereafter
the general case is to use the citation form following the 10s designation, e.g.
tello polo ennem ‘36’.
       To form ordinal numbers, the morpheme kapeng or its abbreviated form
ka, occurs before the numeral as in Cakraningrat kapeng dhuwa' or Cakranin-
grat ka dhuwa' ‘Cakraningrat the second’. Ordinals can also be formed in a
relative clause construction with the number as predicate occurring with the
prefix kapeng or ka (usually treated as a clitic), as in se kadhuwa' ‘the second’.
These forms are discussed in Chapter 7 section 7.
       The basic Madurese quantifiers are:(83)    banne ‘no’
        bannya' ‘many’
        dhiddhi' ‘a few/a little/some’
88 Chapter 3 Lexical categories        kabbi ‘all’

      ‘Paremba’ Joko Tole is the story that I am going to tell.’In both instances here, the n extension is optional. (106) would be perfectly
grammatical with edhingagi in place of edhingagin and (107) would be with
edungengngagia rather than edungengngagina. There is a higher incidence in
the use of the extension in environments such as in (107), where it serves to
break up a V+V sequence, than in word-final position, where no affix, hence no
vowel, follows.
       As argued by Stevens (1968:94), the extension is phonologically a part of
the root, despite the fact that it is often syllabified as part of an adjoining sylla-
ble. Evidence for this is the fact that it acts as part of the root in final syllable
reduplication. For example, in the reduplicated form as pan-arampan ‘several’
(104b) the n extension occurs in the reduplicated syllable prefixed to the root. In
addition, the reduplicated form of (104a) kamman includes the extension, as in
(108).(108) man-kamman ‘everywhere’Additionally, reduplicated forms for the two examples in (105) are ekan-
dukane, which means ‘to become extremely angry’, and eten-patena a plural
form of ‘will be killed’. In both cases, the n occurs in the reduplicated syllable.
Reduplication is described in detail in Chapter 5.","[143, 144]"
"1.1. The category nounThe need for a category noun as opposed to verbs and adjectives can be estab-
lished on morphological as well as syntactic grounds.
      Morphologically, only nouns can occur with the prefix sa-, which means
‘all X’, ‘same X’ or ‘one X’. From the set in (2) bengko ‘house’, saba ‘field’,
and bapa' ‘father’, prototypical nominal concepts, can be distinguished from the
other roots, which denote actions and states, prototypically verbal and adjectival
notions.(2)       bengko   ‘house’         sabengko   ‘all the houses’/‘same house’
          saba     ‘field’         sasaba     ‘all the fields’/’same field’
          bapa'    ‘father’        sabapa'    ‘all the fathers’/‘same father’

        penter    ‘smart’         *sapenter
        kene’     ‘small’         *sakene'Considering the paradigm, which can be replicated manyfold, sa- emerges as a
diagnostic of the category noun. In order for any of the other roots to occur with
the sa- prefix, derivational morphology must occur as well, morphology which
typically derives nouns. So, while toles and penter cannot occur with sa-, de-
rived nominals based on them can. In (3), the suffix -an derives a result nominal
and the circumfix ka-...-an derives an abstract noun.(3)   tolesan     ‘writing’      satolesan     ‘all the writing’
      kapenterran ‘intelligence’ sakapenterran ‘all of the intelligence’The fact that only derived forms of these roots can take sa- corroborates its use-
fulness as a diagnostic for nouns.
      While this is really the only clear morphological test for nouns, there are
syntactic tests as well. First, of the open lexical classes only nouns can be ne-
gated with the morpheme banne ‘no’.(4)   banne bengko ‘no house’

      *banne toles
      *banne entar
      *banne sala
      *banne penter
      *banne kene'The other forms in (4) are negated with ta' (or its dialectal equivalent lo'), which
cannot be used with nouns.(5)   *ta' bengko
      *ta' saba
      *ta' bapa'
       ta' baca          ‘not read’
       ta' toles         ‘not write’
      ta' entar          ‘not go’
      ta' sala           ‘not wrong’
      ta' penter         ‘not smart’
      ta' kene'          ‘not small’Again, derived forms of the verbs and adjectives are acceptable with banne.
64 Chapter 3 Lexical categories(6)   banne tolesan     ‘no written thing’
      banne kapenterran ‘no intelligence’Second, uninflected noun roots can occur before the demonstratives reya ‘this’
and rowa ‘that’ (and others) whereas non-nominal roots cannot.2(7)   bengko rowa          ‘that house’
      saba rowa            ‘that field’

      *toles rowa
      *sala rowa
      *penter rowa
      *kene' rowa      Unlike verbs and adjectives, noun roots can be directly modified by
numbers and quantifiers. In the case of numbers the noun root can be imme-
diately preceded or followed by a number, as in (8), while verbal and adjectival
roots cannot.3(8)   settong bengko       bengko settong              ‘one house’

     king already not hurt   again neck-DEF
     ‘The King’s neck does not hurt anymore.’In comparing (11) and (14), it is clear that some of the lexical items used are the
same in the two variants and some are different. In both (11) and (14), le'er is
used for ‘neck’, a word that refers to the possessions, body parts, or state of the
person being described; words that were paired with alos tenggi word gulu in
(13). Even though in (14) the addressee is a social superior of the speaker, the
referent of the state is not someone to be honored (alos tenggi words are never
used to refer to oneself); therefore, alos tenggi vocabulary is not appropriate.
However, the definite marker -epon, the first person pronoun kaula, the tempor-

al adverb ampon, and the verb anglo ‘hurt’ are all different from the kasar sen-
tence. Comparing (13) and (16) reveals that as was true of (11)/(14), the words
describing the referent are not different (both use alos tenggi as the person re-
ferred to is the King), but the temporal adverb and definite article are different
as this situation calls for alos speech. These sentences clearly demonstrate the
distinction between alos and alos tenggi usage.
       The pair of sentences in (12) and (15) reveal what at first seems to be a bit
of a contradiction. While the alos variant includes different lexical items for
‘what’ (ponapa), the definite marker (-epon), and the personal pronoun (pan-
jennengngan) as is expected, the words associated with the referent of the state
of affairs are also different. This is not true of (11) and (14). The important dif-
ference in this case is, however, the fact that the addressee is a person of higher
status and thus should be described using alos tenggi vocabulary.
       If alos tenggi words are used in place of kasar (or biyasa) vocabulary in
an a setting appropriate for alos speech, the sentences are not acceptable. Thus,
all of the sentences in (17) are ill-formed alos sentences and should not be used
in place of (14).(17) a. *Gulu-epon kaula ampon ta' nganglo pole.
    b. *Gulu-epon kaula ampon ta' songkan pole.
    c. *Le'er-epon kaula ampon ta' nganglo pole.
         (My neck doesn’t hurt anymore.)The ill-formed sentences in (17) demonstrate the inappropriateness of using alos
tenggi vocabulary to refer to oneself.6 Likewise, alos vocabulary cannot substi-
tute for kasar vocabulary simply because the referent of the relevant state of
affairs is a person to be honored. Thus, (16), while acceptable as an alos sen-
tence, cannot be used in a kasar environment; that is, ampon ‘already’ and the
definite marker -epon are inappropriate in kasar speech.","[493, 494]"

     ‘Ina said to Satimma that those doctors cured Marlena’s child.’      The effect of suffixing -agi to verbs of communication can be viewed as
essentially the same as its use with transitive verbs–an indication that the sub-
ject matter argument (instead of beneficiary) is a core argument.

2.3. -agi specifying an endpointThe suffix -agi also serves to specify the endpoint of a theme/object moved

        Madura west
        ‘Empu Bageno spread the new religion to the people in western
        Madura.’In (99a) no particular location is specified as the place where the stones were
piled up. In (99b), however, Masjid Agung Bangkalan is identified as the loca-
tion at which the stones, which have been brought from elsewhere, have been
piled up—the endpoint of the path traversed by the stones. Likewise, the sen-
tence in (100a) does not specify where Empu Bageno spread the new religion,
only that he did so. In (100b), ra'yat neng Madura bara' ‘the people of western
Madura’ are specified as the goal of the action, the endpoint of the spreading of
the religion, albeit in a somewhat abstract sense. The starting point of the path
of an object or objects can also be specified in this way.(101) a. Ngala' tana-na otama-na.

         ‘They took the best soil.’     b. Ngala'-agi tana-na otama-na dhari Rosbaja.

        ‘They took the best soil from Arosbaya.’
308    Chapter 10 Modifications to argument structure
In (101a), there is no specification as to where tanana otamana ‘the best soil’ is
being taken from. However, in (101b), the origin of the soil is specified as being
the area of Arosbaya. The endpoint of the path is inferred from the context of
the sentence.2.4. -agi with instrumentsIn works on related languages (e.g. Sneddon (1996) on Indonesian), the analo-
gue of -agi is analyzed as having an instrumental function in some environ-
ments.3 In Madurese, there are similar constructions with -agi as well. In one
structure, an instrument which is a prepositional object in the basic use of the
verb is a core argument when the verb takes the -agi suffix. This use is some-
what limited, depending primarily on whether or not the instrument is a central
notion to carrying out the action: verbs such as bungkos ‘wrap’, buntut ‘wrap’,
notobi ‘cover’, orap ‘spread’, semprot ‘spray’, tambu' ‘hit (by throwing)’, and
others occur in this construction. The basic and instrumental uses of these verbs
are first illustrated with bungkos ‘wrap’ in (102).(102) a. Diyah mongkos sassa'-an kalaban koran.
         Diyah AV.wrap wash-NOM with       newspaper
         ‘Diyah wrapped the laundry in newspaper.’3
  Son & Cole (2008) contend that -kan does not have an instrumental function in these
types of structures but is simply a case of the structure in which -kan denotes an end-
point, the specific endpoint of the 'instrumental' argument. They cite sentences such as
(i) (from Sneddon 1996), which Arka (1992), Sneddon (1996), and Postman (2002)
take to be the case of an instrument.
(i) Dia mengikat(-kan) tali ke anjing.                   Indonesian
      3SG AV.tie-KAN         rope to dog
      ‘He tied the rope to the dog.’
As Son & Cole (2008) observe, this is similar to the structure in which an endpoint is
specified: the instrumental object, here tali 'rope', can serve as the direct object of the
verb mengikat 'tie' without the -kan suffix and with no specification of what the rope is
tied to, as in (ii) (from Sneddon 1996).
(ii) Dia mengikat tali.                                  Indonesian
      3SG AV.tie       rope
      ‘He tied the rope.’
It is not clear that this analysis can extend to all apparent instrumental cases of -agi. For
example, mongkos 'wrap' cannot take the 'instrumental' NP as direct object without the
suffix. The verb tambu 'hit by throwing' is similarly resistant to this analysis as burus
'dog', as the goal of the throwing is the base direct object (103a). The object thrown or
'instrument', in (103b) bato 'stone', can only be a direct argument when the
-agi suffix is present.

     b. Diyah mongkos-sagi koran       ka sassa'-an.
        Diyah AV.wrap-AGI newspaper to wash-NOM
        ‘Diyah wrapped the laundry in newspaper.’     c. Koran     e-bungkos-sagi (ka) sassa'-an bi' Diyah.
        newspaper OV-wrap-AGI to wash-NOM by Diyah
        ‘Diyah wrapped the laundry in newspaper.’     d. Sassa-'an e-bungkos koran       bi' Diyah.
        wash-NOM OV-wrap newspaper by Diyah
        ‘Diyah wrapped the laundry in newspaper.’     e. Koran      e-bungkos-sagi Diyah ka sassa'-an .
         newspaper OV-wrap-AGI Diyah to wash-NOM
        ‘Diyah wrapped the laundry in newspaper.’The sentence in (102a) illustrates the basic actor voice structure for bungkos
‘wrap’, and the instrument koran ‘newspaper’ is in a PP headed by kalaban
‘with’. In (102b) and (102c) the verb bears the -agi suffix, and koran is a core
argument, object and subject respectively. When the instrument is object, the
theme occurs as a prepositional object in a PP headed by ka ‘to’ (103b). When
the instrument is the subject (103c), the prepositional marking of the theme is
optional as long as the theme occurs immediately after the verb. If it follows the
agent, the preposition is again obligatory (103e). The paradigm for tambu' ‘hit
(by throwing)’ is given in (103).(103) a. Ale'         nambu' burus bi' bato.
         yngr.sibling AV.hit dog with rock
         ‘Little Brother hit the dog with rocks.’     b. Ale'         nambu'-agi bato dha' burus.

        ‘Little Brother hit the dog with rocks.’     c. Bato e-tambu'-agi (dha') burus bi' Ale'.
        rock OV-hit-AGI to         dog by yngr.sibling
        ‘Little Brother hit the dog with rocks.’     d. Burus-sa e-tambu' (bi') bato bi' Ale'.
        dog-DEF OV-hit       by rock by yngr.sibling

310   Chapter 10 Modifications to argument structure
can be omitted when the PP is immediately adjacent to the verb, reminiscent of
the omission of prepositions with verbs of cognition (section 1.4).
      In some ways, the structures in (102) and (103) are similar to the
spray/load alternation in English, and, in fact, semprot ‘spray’ is one of the
verbs that evince this structure.(104) a. Alwi nyemprot tembo' bi' cet.
         Alwi AV.spray wall with paint
         ‘Alwi sprayed the wall with paint.’      b. Alwi nyemprod-dagi cet dha' tembo'.
         Alwi AV.spray-AGI paint to wall
         ‘Alwi sprayed paint on the wall.’Unlike the English counterparts, the two sentences in (104) are reported to be
completely synonymous. It is not the case that (104a) implies that the wall is
completely covered with paint, as it does in English, where this implication
distinguishes it from (104b) in that the latter does not entail full coverage. Thus,
despite the similarities with the English structure, including the prepositional
marking of both the ‘instrument’ and the theme when not direct object, the Ma-
durese structure is distinct.
      Another basically instrumental construction including -agi derives verbs
from certain nouns when they can be characterized as containers. The a-
sentences represent the noun as the object of a preposition and the b-sentences
the derived verb in a propositionally-equivalent sentence.(105) a. Ali noles     pang-asel-an e buku.
         Ali AV.write NOM-succeed at book
         ‘Ali entered the income in the book.’      b. Ali a-buku-wagi pang-asel-an.
         Ali AV-book-AGI NOM-succeed
         ‘Ali entered the income in the book.’(106) a. Polisi nyaba’ maleng e panjara.
         police AV.put thief at jail
         ‘The police put the thief in jail.’      b. Polisi a-panjara'-agi maleng.
         police AV-jail-AGI     thief
         ‘The police jailed the thief.’In (105a) buku ‘book’ is a prepositional object denoting the location of the
                                                               The suffix -agi 311
theme-object pangaselan ‘income’. In (105b), buku forms the root of the actor
voice verb abukuwagi ‘to book’ (‘to enter in the books’). Here the subject Ali
and the object pangaselan remain the same as in (105a) and the sentence is syn-
onymous with the first. The sentences in (106) illustrate the same set of facts
with the noun penjara ‘jail’. It should be noted that English has a similar struc-
ture in which book and jail are zero-derived transitive verbs, where book has the
specialized meaning of charging a criminal act.","[323, 324, 325, 326, 327, 328]"

adjectives in (6) and (7) were not reduplicated, the NPs would be interpreted as
singular or plural depending on the discourse context.
      The only other instances of plurality marked directly on a noun are the
exceptional cases of the interrogatives sapa'an and apa'an, plural counterparts
of sapa ‘who’ and apa ‘what’, as in (8) and (9).","[199, 200]"

AcknowledgmentsThe influence of many people is manifested in numerous ways in the pages that
follow.
       Eschewing time-honored tradition, I would first and foremost like to rre-
cognize the inestimable contribution of my family. Patty, Billy, and Kate pro-
vided vast quantities of moral and physical support. They showed great patience
in the face of my sometimes inexplicable passion for this subject, actually en-
couraging it. They endured the absence of husband, father, coach, companion,
playmate, crossword puzzle chum for a couple months each year while I was off
gathering data; at least they did not complain about it very strenuously. Thanks
guys, you really are the best.
       Surachman Dimyati introduced me to the Madurese language, first as my
research assistant, later my colleague in many of these endeavors, but always as
my friend, opening numerous paths both physical and otherwise for the past 15
years.
       Many speakers of Madurese endured my virtually unending string of
strange queries, my aberrant pronunciation, and my occasional confusion with
great equanimity. I am most grateful for the enthusiasm they showed for the
project. All were wonderful, but deserving of special mention are Masharudin,
Moh. Hasan Sasra, Ruskawi Sjah, and Sugiyono, whom were generous with
their time and energy and willing to set me straight on more than one occasion.
Thanks to Sri Muliyati, Sarwo Santuso, Mauliyati, Mohammad Ridwan, Laila
Qodriyah Ervan, and A. Haitul Umam for their important contributions to my
understanding of their language. And thanks to ‘the boys’ at the Hotel Ningrat
in Bangkalan; they not only contributed linguistic and personal information
through our attempts to understand one another but also made my stays on Ma-
dura all the richer (not to mention once helping me out of a jam).
       I’d like to thank those folks who read a chapter and sometimes much,
much more as the work progressed. Jill Beckman, Stan Dubinsky, Ivan Ivanov,
Kumyoung Lee, Ileana Paul, Cathie Ringen, and Roumyana Slabakova all made
important suggestions, many of which found their way into this volume. In ad-
dition to reading the entire manuscript, Kumyoung provided much needed edi-
torial assistance and frequently rescued me from my lack of mastery of the word
processing software, and special thanks to Eri Kurniawan and Stan for some
technical stuff. Tom Frakes whipped up some nice maps on very short notice.
Bernard Comrie, who apparently drew the short straw, served as series editor
for the book, providing invaluable feedback through his careful reading of the
manuscript. Now adhering to time-honored tradition, I reluctantly release all of

these fine folks from any responsibility for errors, shortcomings, and misappre-
hensions in what follows, all of which I claim as my own.
      Doing this kind of work can require considerable financing. The National
Science Foundation (through grant number SBR 98-09044 to the University of
Iowa), the Fulbright Foundation through the Fulbright-Hays program, and the
United States-Indonesia Society provided much needed support. Closer to
home, the University of Iowa has been extremely generous. Funding was re-
ceived from the Arts and Humanities Initiative, the May Brodbeck Fellowship
in the Humanities, the Obermann Center for Advanced Studies, the Stanley

Introduction
1. Madura and its peopleThe Madurese people are originally indigenous to the island of Madura, located
in the Java Sea just north of East Java (see map 1, following page), and Madura
is part of the province of Jawa Timur (East Java). Due to poor soil conditions
and a low annual rainfall, with an area of 4250 km2, the island was unable to
The Madurese are the third largest ethnic population in Indonesia (Badan Pusat
Statistik 2000).1 According to the 2000 census, there are approximately 6.8
million, compared to 83.8 million Javanese and nearly 31 million Sundanese.
This makes the Madurese language the fourth most-widely spoken language in
Indonesia (the national language, Bahasa Indonesia, being the largest).2 The
Madurese people are originally indigenous to the island of Madura, located in
the Java Sea just north of East Java (see map 1, following page), and Madura is
part of the province of Jawa Timur (East Java). Due to poor soil conditions and
a low annual rainfall, with an area of 4250 km2, the island was unable to
When suffixed to certain nouns and adjectives, the result is a derived adverb, as
insustain a population of more than 3-4 million or so. Thus, there is a long
history of Madurese emigrating to other areas of Indonesia, particularly East
Java, where agricultural conditions and other economic opportunities were
markedly superior, resulting in large, permanent populations in such cities as
Besuki, Situbundo, Probolinggo, Jember, Surabaya, and elsewhere. As of 2000,
roughly 3.5 million Madurese live on Madura itself, meaning that there sizable
population of Madurese-speaking people living in East Java and other areas of
Indonesia, including significant populations on the islands of Kalimantan and1
  Suryadinata, Arfin, and Ananta (2003) contend that there are roughly 200,000 more
Malays than Madurese, arriving at this figure by combining 13 distinct categories of
Malays recognized in the official census (Badan Pusat Statistik 2000).
2
  Other reports put the number of Madurese considerably higher. Ethnologue (Gordon
2005) gives a figure of 13.7 million, while Nothofer (2006) cites 13 million, and Pawi-
tra (2009) 15 million. Others provide yet different numbers. Suryadinata, Arfin, and
Ananta (2003) note that the percentage increase in Madurese population from the 1930
census to the 2000 census falls well below that other other groups and of the country as
a whole, speculating that some may not identify themselves as Madurese for various
reasons.
2 Chapter 1 IntroductionSumatra. As is true of many ethnic groups in Indonesia, considerable Madurese
enclaves are also found in Jakarta, Bandung, and other large cities in Central
and West Java.
      According to Husson (1997:80), early Madurese migration to East Java
began in the 13th century, serfs that were sent “to colonize agricultural lands
and strengthen the Majapahit kingdom”. Additionally, their reputation as fierce
combatants led to the voluntary enlistment or forced conscription of soldiers,
accounting for other waves of Madurese leaving the island during the period
from the 16th to 19th centuries and eventually settling on Java. Added to this
were the shifting alliances of the different kingdoms or sultanates on Madura
with the Mataram empire and the Dutch colonialists.3 There were also patterns
of migration to East Java in search of work and a source of income due to li-
mited opportunities on Madura (Husson 1997:86). More recently, attempts by
the Republic of Indonesia government to redistribute the national population to
ease crowding and fuel economic development through a program of transmi-
gration account for the establishment of significant Madurese populations on
the islands of Kalimantan and Sumatra (in Riau Province) where the Madurese
have sought additional economic opportunities. There is thus a long history of
the migration from Madura.
       However, most previous works on the Madurese language and people3
 See Husson (1997) for details of the political situation.

have focused on Madura Island and the 67 small nearby islands including Ba-
wean, Sapudi, Kangean, and others. Madura proper is comprised of the regen-
cies (kabupaten) of Bangkalan, Sampang, Pamekasan, and Sumenep, moving
eastward on the island (see map 2). Although Sumenep is considered the cultur-
al capital, each regency had its own political institutions and various local influ-
ences.","[5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20]"

4. Cross-clausal null anaphoraAs described in Chapter 11 there are instances of obligatory coreference be-
tween an NP in the matrix clause and a null anaphor in a dependent clause.
These include control structures and the proleptic object structure. In the case of
control into a complement clause, either the subject or the actor of the embed-
ded clause is null, its reference determined by a matrix argument.",[450]

     ‘That thief was caught.’But distributionally, the ratio of object voice structures in a discourse is far
higher than the ratio of passives in the relevant languages. In Madurese narra-
tives, approximately 50-60% of all voice marking on transitive predicates is
object voice, as reported in Davies 2005 and discussed in more detail in Chapter
10 section 4. In English, the percentage is considerably smaller. For example,
Blankenship (1962) reports that passive clauses made up only 7.8% of clauses
in oral and 17.9% in written discourse; other reports based on experiment
(Poole and Field 1976, Biber 1988) and casual observation (e.g. Quirk et al.
1985) also assert passive has a low frequency in English. And similar reports
are available for other languages, e.g. Chinese (Xiao, McEnery and Qiang
2006). Additionally, in languages such as English, the percentage of passives
clauses with overt agents is quite low: 13-20% of passives have an agent phrase
(Svartik 1966, Duškova 1971, Givon 1979) and for German passives 17.8% has
been reported (Stein 1979). For Madurese, 60-70% or more object voice clauses
258    Chapter 9 VPs and verbal marking
have an overt agent or a discourse-linked null pronominal agent.6 Finally, it has
been proposed that in certain narrative discourse, actor voice and object voice
clauses play different functional roles: actor voice providing background infor-
mation and object voice for advancing the plot line (see Hopper 1979 on Clas-
sical Malay, Davies 2005 on Madurese).
       Added to this is the fact that some Indonesian languages, it has been pro-
posed that object voice and passive are distinct structures. Arka (2003) identi-
fies both object voice and passive in Balinese. According to Arka, object voice
is indicated by lack of voice morphology (27) and passive by the suffix -a (28).7(27) Nyoman ejuk        polisi.                                  Balinese

     Nyoman give-PASS money by Wayan
     ‘Nyoman was given money by Wayan.’Additionally, the agent of the object voice in Balinese must be an unmarked NP
(as in (27)) and is a core argument that can participate in a number of grammati-
cal structures (e.g. quantifier float, topicalization, imperatives and others), while
the agent in the passive is expressed in a PP (as in (28)) and is not a core argu-
ment and thus does not participate in other grammatical structures. Specifically,
Arka shows that the agent in the object voice structure can antecedent a reflex-
ive while the agent of a passive cannot.
       The types of grammatical distinctions observable in Balinese do not exist
in Madurese; that is, there is no discernable difference in the grammatical beha-
vior of the agent when it is an NP and when it is the object of a PP. In particu-
lar, unlike Balinese, the agent of the Madurese object voice structure is able to
bind a reflexive-like element.","[274, 275]"
"(3)   Dhokter juwa mareksa     aba'eng dibi'.
      doctor that AV.examine
      ‘The doctor examined herself.’       Reflexives for first and second persons can be formed through the use of
aba'na dibi', (4a) and (5a), or can be marked simply with aba', as in (4b) and
(5b), an instance of using a plain pronoun to mark reflexive (see section 1.3).

       ‘I introduced myself to Deni.’      b. Engko' ngennal-agi aba' ka Deni.

       ‘Have you told Jatim about yourself?’      b. Apa ba'na ella     a-careta bab aba' ka Jatim?
         what you already AV-story about       to Jatim
         ‘Have you told Jatim about yourself?’As indicated in (4a), first person singular reflexives can occur without aba'na
formed simply with the first person pronoun and dibi', sengko' dibi'. Dibi' can
be used with or without aba'na to mark reflexive possessors.","[434, 435]"
