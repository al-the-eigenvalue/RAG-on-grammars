                         The Murle people number about 70,0CO and live in
                   southeastern Sudan between the Nile River and the
                   Ethiopian border.    ‘The main group, the Lowland Lurle,
                   occupies the area around the junction of the Kenjen,
                   Lotilla,            and         Veveno            rivers         where               they            join   to form the

                                  Chapter         9    contains              a    Murle             text        that      has       been
                        broken         down     into        clauses,              with          a    word—by-word                   transla-

                        A brief         analysis            of    the        discourse                   features          of       this

                        and     sentence          boundaries.                     it       is       felt        that      this       level
                        of    Murle       is    too        larse        to       include             in       its      entirety,           so
                        the    analysis           is       confined              to    the          text        given      in       the

       There are a number of institutions      and individuals
 who are interested    in research on languages     in Sudan   and
 there is a need to make research presently being done
 available  to others.    The purpose of these Occasional
 Papers is to serve as an outlet     for work papers and other
 useful data which might otherwise      remain in private    files.
 We hope that Sudanese    and non-Sudanese    linguists  alike
 may profit from such a series of papers,       Manuscripts for the series are welcomed. A clear,
 typewritten copy following the format of the papers  in
 this volume should be sent to the editors for considera
