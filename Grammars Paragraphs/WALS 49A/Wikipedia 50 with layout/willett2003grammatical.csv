                             Nxa?amxcin falls under the traditional classification of ‘polysynthetic’.
                     Words in polysynthetic languages are typically long and morphologically
                     complex, with a single word being able to express the full semantic content of a
                     complete sentence in a non-polysynthetic language.            As seems to be the case
                     with polysynthetic languages in general, Nxa?amxcin has obligatory pro-drop
                     for both subject and object position.       Thus, no subject or object pronouns are
                     overtly expressed, as shown in the following examples:8
                            8Views on clause structure in Salish languages are mainly divided into two
                     camps. The first supports the Pronominal Argument Hypothesis (e.g. Jelinek
                     1984, Jelinek and Demers 1994) according to which subject and object arguments

                     In the transitive construction in (52), the 2nd person sg. object is marked by the
                     suffix -si and the Ist sg. subject by the suffix -nn. No overt pronouns are present
                     to indicate these grammatical categories.        In example (53), the Ist person sg.
                     subject is marked by the intransitive clitic kn. Again, there is no overt intransitive
                      subject pronoun.
                             When overt noun phrases are expressed, the basic transitive word order is
                     VOS, although there is some flexibility of word order as shown in the following
                     examples:

                     are realized as pronominal elements on the predicate.          Overt noun phrases are
                     syntactic adjuncts coindexed with these pronominal elements. As adjuncts, these
                     noun phrases are able to maintain some freedom of word order. In the other camp
                     are researchers who support a configurational approach in which noun phrases
                     are themselves arguments coindexed with agreement morphology on the
                     predicate (e.g. Gardiner 1993, H. Davis 1999). I assume the latter analysis in this
                     work, although neither theoretical approach is crucial to the descriptive goals
                     pursued here.","[106, 107]"

                     In the Kanjobal example in (186b), we see that the predicate ‘eat’ and the noun
                     ‘bread’ appear as independent words, as in (186a).           Mithun (p.852) notes,
                     however, that “[a]lthough they remain separate words, the V and the
                     incorporated noun (IN) form a syntactic unit equivalent to an intransitive V; this is
                     evident from the pronominal affixes within the V. Agents of transitive V’s appear
                     in the ergative case [...] Agents of intransitives appear in the absolutive”.        The
                     predicate ‘eat’ in (186b) is marked for a subject in absolutive case indicating that
                     the noun ‘bread’ is not an independent object.          The Lahu example in (187b)
                     contains the predicate ‘drink’ preceded by the noun ‘liquor’. The noun is not
                     marked accusative, as in (187a), and Mithun (p.853) notes that “[i]t qualifies the
                     type of drinking discussed”.
                             In other languages the noun and verb stem of lexical compounds combine
                     morphologically to form a single complex word.            Some examples are given below
                     for Walmatjari (Australian) and Comanche (Uto-Aztecan):22
                              Walmatjari

                     and Canonge (1958) as the source for the Comanche examples.","[412, 413]"
"
                      In each of the above examples the agent functions as the subject of the clause.
                      This is evidenced by the fact that it is the overt agent NP in (141) and (142) that is
                      in direct case, as opposed to the patient which is oblique.          The agent in (145) to
                      (147) is also marked by the Ist person sg. subject clitic kn, indicating that the
                      agent (‘I’) is the subject argument.         The use of clitics to mark subjects also
                      indicates that these antipassive constructions are intransitive.         While the suffix -m
                      is used to mark both antipassive and passive voice, note that unlike the passive,
                      antipassive voice is formed on intransitive stems only and never stems that have
                      been transitivized, as is the case with passive voice.",[177]

                                                                                                               401                     Both of the above examples illustrate lexical compounds in which a verb stem
                     and a noun stem combine to form a complex predicate.
                             For all of the examples given in (186) to (189), Mithun claims (p.856) that
                     “a V stem and a N stem are combined to form an intransitive predicate denoting a
                     unitary concept.     The compound is more than a description; it is the name of an
                     institutionalized activity or state. The IN loses its individual salience both
                     semantically and syntactically. It no longer refers to a specific entity; instead, it
                     simply narrows the scope of the V”.
                             Mithun refers to her Type II NI as the manipulation of case.            This type of
                     noun incorporation is like lexical compounding in that the incorporated noun is
                     not marked for definiteness, number or case. The noun is no longer a syntactic
                     argument in the clause, but instead qualifies the verb with which it combines.            The
                     difference between the manipulation of case and lexical compounding is that
                     the former allows for an oblique argument to appear in the case position that
                     would normally be occupied by the incorporated noun.               Thus, while lexical
                     compounding results in intransitive predicates, the manipulation of case results
                     in transitive predicates even though the incorporated noun does not serve as the
                     syntactic direct object.      Mithun gives the following examples from Yucatec
                     Mayan:23
                              Yucatec Mayan

                     In (190a) the direct object ce’ ‘tree’ is an independent constituent followed by
                     the oblique locative kool ‘cornfield’.       In (190b), ‘tree’ no longer has direct object
                     status as it has been incorporated.      Instead the locative is case-marked as the
                     direct object.","[413, 414]"

                     3.4.2   Determining if a Category is Derivational or Inflectional
                             The literature outlines numerous criteria for distinguishing between
                      derivation and inflection, but in reality it has proven impossible to determine a
                      steadfast set of rules with cross-linguistic application that predict which
                      categories should be considered derivational and which inflectional.               Bybee
                      (1985) considers the derivational vs. inflectional distinction to be a gradient one
                     whereby categories most intrinsically tied to the root (i.e. derivational) are at one
                      end of a spectrum while the categories least tied to the root (i.e. inflectional) are at
                      the other.   Bybee (p.99) makes certain generalizations regarding the cross-
                      linguistic status of some categories, however acknowledging that a derivational
                      category in one language may be inflectional in another.           This is also noted by
                      Anderson (1992:82), who uses diminutive formation in Fula (Niger-Congo) and
                      English as a comparative example; the diminutive category is considered to be
                      inflectional in Fula, while in English diminutive forms are viewed as derivational.
                              Cases like this where one category can appear at different ends of a
                      spectrum depending on the language, involve more than just a distinction as to
                     where the operation actually takes place (i.e. the lexicon vs. syntax).             Bybee
                      states (1985:99) that “in cases where similar conceptual content is expressed in
                     the two different ways, we will find that the inflectional expression requires a
                     fully general meaning, while the derivational does not”. Hence, while English
                     and Fula each have a diminutive category, the claim that it is derivational in one

                     tied to the root than the latter.2!
                              Of the numerous criteria found in the literature, I have focused on five
                      while determining which categories belong at the derivational stem level and
                      which at the inflectional stem level in Nxa?amxcin: (i) the Peripheral Affix Test;
                      (ii) semantic relevance; (iii) the ability to change features in lexical
                      representations; (iv) portmanteau morphemes; (v) the Free Analog Test.
                              (i) The Peripheral Affix Test. The first of these criteria is the widely noted
                      observation (appearing as Universal 28 in Greenberg 1963 and as The
                      Peripheral Affix Test in Beard 1995) regarding the cross-linguistic consistency of
                      ordering of derivational and inflectional morphemes with respect to each other.
                      Anderson (1992:77) writes that:
                              [...] in forms where both derivational and inflectional morphology are
                              overtly represented, material corresponding to productive inflection comes
                              “outside of’ other morphology. That is, where two or more suffixes are
                              involved, inflectional ones come after derivational ones; and where
                              prefixes are involved, inflectional ones come before derivational ones.
                              Even where a prefix and a suffix are involved, an argument can sometimes
                              be constructed for the relative order in which they must have been added
                              to the stem, and in such cases as well the derivational material seems to be
                              added prior to the addition of productive inflection.
                      Thus, we can expect to find derivational morphemes closer to the root than
                      inflectional morphemes.
                              There are a number of operations in Nxa?amxcin that are quite clearly tied
                      to the root and can thus be considered derivational based on the Peripheral Affix
                      Test. These categories are marked by either morphemes or reduplicated forms and
                      always appear at the innermost core of the Nxa?amxcin word.               The inchoative
                      and out-of-control markers actually appear inside the root as infixes, as shown in
                      (45) and (46) respectively:
                             21Interestingly enough, I have often had difficulty directly eliciting
                     causative and inchoative constructions in Nxa?amxcin. While causative and
                     inchoative are clearly syntactic categories in English, they are derivational in
                     Nxa?amxcin. Under Bybee’s analysis the derivational causative and inchoative
                     categories should have meanings that are of greater relevance to the predicate
                     than the causative and inchoative categories realized as independent syntactic
                     items. This might account for the difficulty in eliciting these constructions.","[66, 67]"

                     Mithun (p.859) states that “Type II goes further than Type I [...] in having an
                     effect beyond the V itself. Instead of simply reducing the valence of the V by
                     one, it permits another argument of the clause to occupy the case role vacated by
                     the IN. The result is a lexical device for manipulating case relations within
                     clauses.”
                              Mithun’s Type III noun incorporation is referred to as the manipulation of
                     discourse structure and is “used to background known or incidental information
                     within portions of discourse”(p.859).           Mithun states that languages exhibiting
                     Type III noun incorporation are usually polysynthetic with subjects and objects
                     being obligatorily marked by pronominal affixes on predicates.              Mithun writes
                     (p.859):
                              In such languages, V’s - which carry most of the information - may of
                              course be qualified by N’s indicating the type of patient, instrument, or
                              location involved in the action or state. However, the qualifying N’s often
                              represent known or incidental information, rather than significant new
                              entities. A separate nominal constituent would sidetrack the attention of
                              the listener; the solution is NI. IN’s are not salient constituents in
                              themselves, whose presence might obstruct the flow of information. They
                              simply ride along with their host V’s.
                      Mithun provides the following examples from Huahtla Nahuatl (Uto-Aztecan)
                      and Koryak (Chukotko-Kamchatkan):24
                              Huahtla       Nahuatl

                                     ‘Where is the knife? I want it now.’

                            24Mithun cites Merlan (1976) as the source of the Huahtla Nahuatl data,
                      and Bogoras (1917) as the source of the Koryak data.","[414, 415]"

                             significance but used only in combination with other stems or elements of
                             words and usually unrelated in form to the independent words of the same
                             significance, furnish apparent instances of incorporation, in that they are
                             sometimes used as objects of verb stems with which they are combined.
                             They are however also employed subjectively and adverbially, and are
                             therefore more than incorporated nouns. The essential nature and function
                             of these elements is still obscure, and until they become better understood
                             they also can furnish no proof of objective noun-incorporation.
                                                                                   A. Kroeber 1909:572-3                              ... it is clear that verbal affixes that refer to nouns, in other words, convey a
                              substantival idea, are not instances of noun incorporation if they are
                             etymologically unrelated to the independent nouns or noun stems with
                             which they seem logically connected. Such affixes are generally either
                             instrumental (Siouan, Shoshonean) or local (Kwakiutl, Salish) in character,
                             but may also be employed to represent the logical object or even, in the
                             case of intransitive verbs, subject (this use is characteristic of Kwakiutl,
                             Chemakum, and Salish). As long, however, as they are lexically distinct
                             from noun stems proper, they must be looked upon as grammatical
                             elements pure and simple, however concrete their signification may seem.
                             They are logically related to independent nouns of the same or allied
                             meaning as are tense affixes to independent adverbs of time.
                                                                                             Sapir 1911:251-2
                              The main reason lexical affixes have not fit neatly into any specific cross-
                      linguistic category is due to their dual or ‘split’? behaviour.     As Egesdal (1981)
                     points out, lexical information is generally associated with stems and grammatical
                      information with affixes. In Salish, he claims, we have an affix that carries lexical
                      information.    Egesdal also notes the lack of etymological relationship between the
                      lexical affixes and their independent forms; bound stems generally bear no
                     resemblance whatsoever to their overt NP counterpart(s).            The following forms
                     illustrate that this is clearly the case for Nxa?amxcin:

                     resemblance to their corresponding independent forms in the righthand column.
                      In fact, the bound stems in (150) cannot even be interpreted as reduced forms of
                     the independent nouns.       This is an observation that has been noted consistently
                     throughout the Salish literature.      Egesdal surmises that the fact that these affixes
                      are seemingly archaic morphemes within the family has deterred many Salishanists
                      from making any speculative claims as to their origin.
                              Following A. Kroeber’s and Sapir’s reference to Salish “substantival”
                      suffixes, there was relatively little work published on these affixes—outside of
                     Reichard 1938 and Vogt 1940—auntil the sixties and seventies when research on
                      a variety of different Salish languages surfaced.       Most of this work was largely
                      descriptive, resulting in a larger amount of data made available for future research.
                     This includes works such as Pidgeon’s (1970) description of lexical suffixes in
                      Saanich, Haeberlin’s (1974) previous description of pan-Salish lexical suffixes
                      edited by M.T. Thompson, and Saunders and Davis’ (1975a) discussion of Bella
                     Coola.    Newman (1968) and Kinkade (1973) both presented papers at the
                     International Conference on Salish Languages|4, Newman’s work a
                     comparative look at lexical suffixes across the Salish family and Kinkade’s
                     devoted to lexical suffixes in Nxa?amxcin.         Discussion of lexical suffixes also
                     appeared in various grammars during this time period, such as Harris 1963;
                     Kuipers 1967, 1974; and Leslie 1979; among others. In 1987, A. Mattina
                     presented a paper at the 26th Conference on American Indian Languages which
                     was a comparative study of lexical suffixes and lexical prefixes across the Salish
                     family.
                            Works by Gerdts and Hinkson (1996) and Mithun (1997) have focused on
                     the diachronic development of lexical affixes. Gerdts and Hinkson (p.164)
                     propose that “lexical suffixes are the final stage of a process whereby a free noun
                     becomes increasingly fused to an element with which it is compounded until it
                     emerges as a bound form.       Other functionally similar processes—noun stripping
                     (Miner 1986) and noun incorporation (Mithun 1984)—<can be considered stages

                              While it is clear that the category voice can alter the lexical representation
                      of a lexeme, and this property is widely regarded as a diagnostic for determining
                      whether an operation is derivational or inflectional, the status of voice as
                      derivational remains controversial (as does the status of valence changing
                      operations), in part because of the high degree of productivity of certain
                      operations such as passive.      Scalise (1988:573—4) considers productivity to be a
                      diagnostic for distinguishing between derivation and inflection, while Anderson

                     difficult to define, and I will therefore exclude it as a diagnostic.       I will contain all
                     operations that involve changes to the lexical representation of a lexeme within
                     the derivational stem.
                             (iv) Portmanteau Morphemes.           A fourth noticeable distinction between
                     derivation and inflection is the fact that portmanteau morphemes are generally
                     restricted to the level of inflection. A portmanteau morpheme is a single formative
                     that marks more than one operation on a stem.           In Nxa?amxcin, the subject and
                     object markers are all portmanteau morphemes.            Consider the following example:
                      (57)   ter’ qneas
                             tor’q-nt-sa-s
                             kick-TR-1s0-3ER
                             S/he kicked me.                                                                 Y16.221
                     In (57) the predicate is marked by the suffix -sa, which marks three different
                     categories:   (i) object; (ii) first person; and (iii) singular. The suffix -s marks two
                     different categories:    (i) subject and (ii) third person.   (Number is marked
                     separately for third person, as shown below in example (59)). Anderson
                     (1992:76) remarks that “it seems to be the case that portmanteaux are much rarer
                     in derivation (if indeed such elements exist at all) [...] there do not ever seem to be
                     elements which combine inflectional and derivational categories in the same
                     portmanteau”.
                             (v) The Free Analog Test. As for the fifth and final criterion, Beard (1995)
                     points out that free morphemes, such as prepositions, postpositions, auxiliaries
                     and case markers, are assigned to specific structural positions in the syntax.
                     Because derivational operations take place before the level of syntax, we would
                     expect markers of derivational operations to never be realized as free morphemes.
                     Free morphemes must be restricted to inflection since it is only at the level of
                     inflection that structural positions are available for these morphemes.             The fact
                     that “any category marked by a free morpheme must be a syntactic hence
                     inflectional category” is referred to by Beard (1995:102) as the Free Analog Test.","[72, 73]"

                      argument st’a?cinom ‘deer’ has been clefted, surfacing to the left of the                      predicate ?aw’tap ‘follow’ and followed by the subordinating particle fu?.               Like
                      active voice constructions, the ergative argument (transitive subject) of a topical
                      object construction can be optionally marked by quirky case, hence the
                      appearance of an oblique marker preceeding st’a?cinam ‘deer’.               However, unlike                      active voice constructions, the predicate of the clefted ergative argument is
                      preceded by the particle wa.       In active voice constructions this is only the case
                      when an absolutive argument is clefted.
                              What examples (113b) and (114) show is that the agent (or non-topic
                      argument) in topical object constructions shows properties of both active voice
                      ergative and absolutive arguments.        First, the topical object agent can be marked
                      for quirky case, a noted property of ergative arguments.           Second, the topical
                      object agent can trigger the appearance of the particle wa, a noted property of
                      absolutive arguments in active voice constructions.
                              The properties of topical object voice are summarized below:

                                According to Givén (1994, 2001), in passive voice constructions the
                      patient is the most topical argument while the agent is non-topical.           Kroeber
                      (1999:25) writes that “[a]ll Salish languages have some sort of construction that
                      is used to mark reduced topicality of the agent of a transitive clause, and/or
                      increased topicality of the patient (object) of the clause. The discourse functions
                      of these constructions are analogous to those of passives of European languages
                      [...]”. Following Givén’s schema in (194), we can illustrate this as follows:
                      (116)     Relative Topicality of Agent and Patient in Nx Passive Voice
                                Agent   << Patient
                      Cross-linguistically, one generally finds that in passive voice constructions the
                      patient argument is the clause subject and the agent is either oblique or
                      suppressed altogether.      Nxa?amxcin passives are stereotypical in that (i) the
                      predicate is overtly marked for passive voice; (ii) the patient is realized as subject;
                      and (iii) the agent is either marked oblique or is omitted.
                                With respect to the first property, passive predicates are marked by the
                      suffix -m, the same suffix used to mark antipassive and middle voice, along with
                      several other functions.       Some examples of predicates marked for passive voice
                      are given below:

                      oblique-marked noun phrases in antipassive clauses.24
                              The patient argument can be omitted in antipassive constructions,
                      illustrating the non-topical status of the patient role.      Consider the following
                      example:
                      (151)   7%      tue? = sx’a?cinm               yafpqin

                                      that    deer                   gather-IN=head-(3AB)
                              hiy     ni?k’”anm               xSlq’m          Ix

                              [There were a lot of deer. They picked some out and killed them.]              —AflI:8
                      Example (151) contains two separate antipassive constructions which refer back
                      to the same patient, s%’a?cinm ‘deer’. The patient appears in a preceding clause,                      and does not resurface as an oblique argument with the two following
                      antipassive predicates (ni?k’“anm ‘pick out’ and xalq’m ‘kill’) even though
                      sx’arcinm is clearly the semantic patient argument of these predicates                              The properties of antipassive voice are summarized below:

                             24Gerdts and Hukari (2000:96) note that “the oblique-marked object in
                     Halkomelem antipassives is usually third person and inanimate. It can be definite
                     or indefinite, though often it has a non-individualized or non-specific meaning”.","[178, 179]"

                     8.4.4.1.1 Mithun’s Analysis of Noun Incorporation
                             The broad use of the term noun incorporation is best illustrated in Mithun
                      1984, who writes that “NI apparently arises as part of a general tendency in
                     language for V’s to coalesce with their non-referential objects” (p.891).            She
                     distinguishes four separate types of noun incorporation each with a different
                     function.   She claims (p.891) that in Type I noun incorporation, “the NI reflects a
                     reduction of [the object’s] individual salience within predicates”.          Type II NI is
                     used to “background arguments within clauses”.             Type III NI is used “as a
                     device for backgrounding old or incidental information within discourse”.              And
                     finally, Type IV NI has become a classificatory system in which “generic N’s are

                             Mithun’s first noun incorporation type is labelled lexical compounding.
                     She writes (p.848):
                             If a language exhibits any NI at all, it will contain basic lexical compounds.
                             Structurally, compounding consists of the derivation of a complex lexical
                             item from a combination of two or more stems. The constituent stems may
                             be of almost any grammatical class (nouns, verbs, adjectives etc.), as may
                             the resulting compound. [...] The term ‘incorporation’ is generally used to
                             refer to a particular type of compounding in which a V and N combine to
                             form a new V. The N bears a specific semantic relationship to its host V - as
                             patient, location, or instrument.
                     Mithun comments on the inefficiency of allowing for identical expressions in a
                     language, and argues that languages incorporate nouns for a reason.                 With
                     respect to /exical compounding, Mithun (p.848—9) claims that “[s]ome entity,
                     quality, or activity is recognized sufficiently to be considered name-worthy in its
                     own right [...] The activity or quality designated by the NV compound is viewed
                     as a recognizable, unitary concept, rather than the chance co-occurrence of some
                     action or state and some entity”.       The noun in such a compound is non-specific
                     (i.e. non-referential) and, as a result, is not marked for the categories of
                     definiteness and number.         Mithun notes that the NV compound may be written as
                     separate words, as in the following examples from Kanjobal (Mayan) and Lahu
                     (Tibeto-Burman):2!","[411, 412]"

                     Examples (180) to (182) illustrate the introduction of a participant via an
                     independent nominal which, according to coreferencing judgements, is
                     subsequently referred to by a lexical suffix.
                             Czaykowska-Higgins, Willett and Bart note, however, that the results of
                     these tests are not conclusive.     These examples were elicited in isolation and the
                     coreferential interpretation may have been forced by pragmatics.              Such
                     interpretations can easily be forced with English compounds.               Consider the
                     following examples:
                     (183)   I went moose;-hunting on Sunday, and let me tell you, they; were pretty
                             scarce.
                     (184)   I went berry;-picking yesterday, and Mary ate them.                  C,W&B    1996:37
                     (185)   The strawberries; are ripe now, so I went berry;-picking.            C,W&B    1996:37
                     English speakers were consulted for judgments on coreferentiality in examples
                     (183) to (185).     The coreferencing marked in these examples was agreed upon by
                     all speakers.     Thus, speakers felt that the compounded noun ‘moose’ in (183) was
                     coreferential with the pronoun ‘they’, the compounded noun ‘berry’ in (184)
                     was coreferential with the pronoun ‘them’, and the independent noun

                     These results are clearly problematic and Czaykowska-Higgins, Willett and Bart
                     raised questions as to the grammatical accuracy of the judgements in (177) to
                     (182) in light of results like those in (183) to (185).
                             With bound stem constructions resembling compounding with respect to
                     word structure rules and the generic interpretation of nominals, I now present
                     additional support for a compound analysis of lexical affixation based on

"                      5.2.2 Obliques
                                 Oblique marking appears with noun phrases that do not have any direct
                      argument status in the clause.        Such noun phrases are described by N. Mattina
                      (2002:276) as
                                 non-locative, adjunct determiner phrases. These adjuncts are syntactically
                                 oblique in that, unlike core arguments, they are never cross-referenced on
                                 the clause head. They are also semantically oblique in the sense that they
                                 consistently show the partiality of reference similar to English some and
                                 the partitive use of plural and mass nouns, the hallmarks of non-specific
                                 phrases cross-linguistically (Ultan 1978). Likely related to this specificity
                                 is the fact that oblique phrases cannot encode possessors or occur within
                                 the scope of a strong quantifier. They are also thematically limited to a
                                 small number of semantic roles: instrument [ ], theme [ ], and factitive [ ].
                                 Oblique nouns in Nxa?amxcin are preceded by the oblique marker t, as in

                     and then discuss oblique and locative marking.          Finally, I look at the syntax of

                                These observations are preliminary and more data is required to gain
                      further insight into indefinite object voice constructions.        Clearly, however, they
                      play a role in the elaborate voice system found in Nxa?amxcin.
                                The properties of indefinite object voice are summarized below:

                                Coming under a different sub-domain within the category voice is
                      semantic voice.     While examining instances of pragmatic voice in the previous
                      four sections, it was necessary to look beyond the single clause construction in
                      order to understand the essential functions of the various types of pragmatic
                      voice.    This is not the case with semantic voice operations since their primary
                      functions are not dependent on discourse factors.
                             According to Givén (2001:93), semantic voice operations tamper with the
                      three central properties of a prototypical transitive construction: (i) While
                      prototypical transitive constructions contain a “volitional, controlling, active,
                      intiating agent responsible for the event”, operations of semantic voice result in
                      “decreased agentivity of the agent/subject”.         (ii) The patient in a prototypical
                      transitive construction “involves a non-volitional, inactive, non-controlling

                      transitive clauses contain a verb that is both telic and perfective; semantic voice
                      operations effectively decrease “telicity or perfectivity of the verb”.
                              Within the sub-category of semantic voice, three different operations are

                     Both bound stems =ups and =us appear to have a classificatory use in (146) and
                      (148) in that they cooccur with numerals to indicate a “type” of something.
                     Example (147) leaves us with a broad scope as we do not know if =ups is
                     reflective of the SHAPE/DIMENSION or FUNCTION of ‘bitterroot’.
                                   The number of bound stems functioning as numeral classifiers is much
                      smaller than those functioning as compounded stems.            Only a subset of these
                     bound stems have emerged with a classifier usage, which seems to be the case for
                     other Salish languages as well. While numeral classifiers are homophonous with
                     their compound counterparts, they differ from the compound bound stems in
                     three important ways: (i) they combine primarily with numerals and quantifiers; (ii)
                     they can cooccur with a coreferenced direct noun; and (iii) their semantic
                     interpretations are much broader.
                                   With respect to the first property, we see in examples (124) to (148) that
                     Nxaramxcin classifiers combine primarily with numerals (e.g. (124) and (141))
                     and quantifiers such as k’“inx ‘how many’ (e.g. (129) and (139)).             However, a
                     handful of examples indicate that the use of these classifiers is spreading to
                     adjective stems (e.g. (130) and (138)).
                                   Turning to the second property, a number of examples provide clear
                     evidence that classifiers can cooccur with a coindexed direct noun phrase (e.g.
                     (127), (130), (134) and (137-139)). As will be addressed in section 8.4.4.2.1, this
                     property is specific to the classifier usage of these bound stems and is prohibited
                     with the compound usage.
                                   Many classifiers also differ from compound bound stems in their semantic

                     A number of the classifiers in (149) are given an identical gloss with their lexical
                      suffix counterpart.        Other classifiers, however, take on much broader semantics.
                      Take for example =a/?st ‘round’, =alq” ‘long and thin’, and =ap ‘round’.              Unlike
                     the lexical suffix counterparts, these classifiers do not refer to specific items, but
                     rather categorize the SHAPE/DIMENSION of a corresponding noun.               This distinction
                     is in line with Gerdts, Hinkson and Hukari’s (2002:150) observation for
                     Halkomelem that such bound stems become “acategorial and semantically
                     bleached when used as a classifier”.
                             From the data examined, it appears that three of the classifiers in (149),
                      =kan ‘container’, =qinwil ‘load’ and =dtiy’a? ‘something flat’, are no longer
                     used productively to form bound stem compounds, but have maintained a
                     classifier usage.","[387, 388, 389]"

                     some type of quirky case-marking as ergatives of applicative (26) and transitive
                     ((27) to (29)) clauses in Nxa?amxcin do not have oblique status. This type of
                     ergative marking is a pattern common to the Southern Interior Salish languages,
                     as addressed in Kroeber 1988, 1999:52-3.
                             There is evidence that the oblique marker tis in the process of
                     disappearing in the language as sometimes the oblique marker is omitted
                     altogether by speakers.        This phenomenon has been taking place in other Salish
                     languages as well to varying degrees.6

                             Nxaramxcin makes use of a set of locative prepositions to mark adjunct
                     arguments of location.         These locative prepositions have been previously
                     discussed in Kinkade 1974 and N. Mattina 2002, and are listed in (30).","[101, 102]"

                             With respect to the morphological structure in (2), Czaykowska-Higgins
                     presents arguments to support her analysis of a morphological root, stem and
                      word level.   She claims that the morphological root can be isolated as an
                      independent level based on the fact that certain affixes target the root only.         In
                      addition to the morphological root, Czaykowska-Higgins argues for the existence
                      of two more constituents:       the morphological stem and the morphological word.
                      She claims (1998:171) that the morphological stem “consists of all morphology
                      which is not relevant to the syntax and which represents the lexical content of a
                      Columbian word”.       The morphological stem contains the locative prefixes,
                      reduplicative affixes, primary affixes, and the nonreferential uses of lexical
                      suffixes.   Czaykowska-Higgins considers all of these morphemes to be lexical,
                      stating (1998:159-160) that “[l]exical morphemes are those which are not in any
                      way directly relevant to the syntax; this class includes some morphology that is
                      often referred to as derivational”.     The morphological word, on the other hand,
                      contains morphemes that are of syntactic relevance.           These include the aspectual
                      affixes, object and subject markers, transitive and intransitive suffixes, and the
                      referential uses of lexical suffixes.
                              The division between the morphological stem and the morphological word
                      marks a contrast between two separate uses of lexical suffixes:           nonreferential
                      and referential respectively.     For the first type, which appears inside the
                      morphological stem domain, the lexical suffixes “play no role in the syntax but
                      instead serve to specify or extend the lexical meaning of the Root to which they
                      are affixed” (1998:164).     The referential lexical suffixes, which appear outside the
                      morphological stem, are considered to “function as morphosyntactic objects” in
                      that they “seem to satisfy an internal argument of the root and to have meanings
                      which are fairly concrete or referential” (1998:164).
                              Czaykowska-Higgins points out that the two functions of lexical suffixes
                      suggest that a lexical vs. grammatical (or morphosyntactic) distinction may be
                      more relevant in an analysis of the morphological structure of Nxa?amxcin

                     between lexical and grammatical/morphosyntactic morphemes in word formation
                      marks the boundary between the morphological stem and the morphological
                      word in the structure in (2). Czaykowska-Higgins defines morphosyntactic and
                      lexical morphemes as follows:
                      (3)     Morphosyntactic morphemes
                                     are relevant to the syntax; that is, they
                                             i.     exhibit inflectional (configurational, agreement,
                                                    inherent, or phrasal) properties
                                     or      il.    reflect the syntactic frame or argument structure of a
                                                      stem
                              Lexical morphemes
                                     change or extend the lexical meaning of a stem
                                                                                Czaykowska-Higgins       1998:159
                      Czaykowska-Higgins makes it clear that her use of the term “morphosyntactic”
                      has much broader scope than that of “inflectional”.          She writes (1998:159),
                      “[t]he morphosyntactic category as I am defining it includes morphemes that
                      reflect what are traditionally considered to be inflectional properties such as case,
                      number, gender, and aspect, but also includes morphemes that play some part in
                      determining or reflecting the syntactic frame or the argument structure of a Root.
                      In other words any entity that plays a role in the syntax is morphosyntactic,
                      whether that role is inflectional or functional”.       In effect, Czaykowska-Higgins
                      argues that a derivational-inflectional distinction like that defined in Anderson
                      1982, 1988 cannot account for the dual behaviour of the lexical suffixes, thus, a
                      lexical-grammatical distinction has more explanatory value in this case.5
                              4Czaykowska-Higgins notes that the order of morphemes also supports a
                      lexical vs. grammatical/morphosyntactic distinction.
                              5Rice (2000) also takes an alternate view in her morphological analysis of
                      Athapaskan verbs. Instead of a derivational vs. inflectional distinction, Rice
                      distinguishes between lexical items and functional items. The former covers items
                      that are usually labelled derivational, while the latter includes some items that
                      have been considered derivational and others that have been viewed as
                      inflectional.","[41, 42, 43]"

                      As the active example in (113a) illustrates, it is the patient of the clause (i.e. the
                      direct object ttw’it ‘boy’) that is marked by wa.           In the topical object example in
                      (113b), however, it is the agent of the clause (st’a?cinom ‘deer’) that is marked                      by wa and not the patient.      If wa is in fact linked to absolutive case, then the
                      agent of topical object constructions appears to be patterning with absolutives.
                      However, with respect to quirky case marking in which the ergative argument
                      (i.e. transitive subject) is marked oblique (section 5.3), the following example
                      suggests that it is the agent argument in topical object constructions that is in fact
                      the grammatical subject:

                     positions, hence the fact that all polysynthetic languages show pro-drop for both
                     subject and direct object.                     Any overt NPs must surface as adjuncts coindexed

                                                                                                          406                     unlike example (195), the head nakt ‘bed’ is generated under N in the V
                     complement position. If object morphology is present on the verb it will absorb
                     the case-feature for that position and, as a result, nakt ‘bed’ cannot be licensed.
                     If object morphology is absent from the verb, as Baker argues it is in (197), then
                     nakt is not coindexed with any morpheme in the verb and therefore violates the
                     MVC.     However, if the head nakt incorporates into the verb via head movement
                     (Travis 1984), then the trace of nakt in the direct object position is coindexed
                     with a morpheme in the verb and passes the MVC.
                             Thus, while Mithun (1984) (as well as Mithun and Corbett (1999)) claims
                     that the N+V form in an example like (197) is functionally motivated, Baker
                     (1996) claims such forms are syntactically required. In more specific terms, noun
                     incorporation is a direct result of the Polysynthesis Parameter (or Morphological
                      Visibility Condition) which Baker claims is operative in true polysynthetic
                      languages like Nahuatl (Uto-Aztecan), Rembarrnga (Gunwinyguan),
                     Nunggubuyu (Australian, non-Pama-Nyungan), Mayali (Australian), Chukchi
                      (Chukchi-Kamchatkan), Wichita (Caddoan), and languages of the Iroquoian and
                      Tanoan families.
                             Baker presents a very clear analysis of the syntactic operation involved in
                     NI formation.     He also gives a detailed discussion of the properties one would
                      expect to find in such constructions and the relevent tests to determine whether
                      or not a syntactic process has taken place. As a result, I will focus specifically on
                      Baker’s work here and use his findings and examples as tools for comparison
                     with the Nxa?amxcin data. Use of the term noun incorporation is henceforth
                      strictly in the spirit of Baker.","[417, 418, 419]"

                     5.2.1     Determiners and Demonstratives
                               The Nxa?amxcin determiner and demonstrative systems are addressed in
                     N. Mattina 2002 (see also Kinkade 1967b).           According to N. Mattina (p.263),
                     there are four determiners, listed in (5):5                              4Note that example (3) contains an adjective stem marked irrealis by the
                     prefix kat-. This suggests that adjectives pattern with nouns with respect to
                     irrealis marking. I do not, however, have enough adjective examples to confirm
                     this.
                              5It is very difficult to understand the underlying semantics of Nxa?amxcin
                     determiners by examining isolated texts. Both Matthewson (1998) and Kroeber
                     (1999) maintain that contrasts in Salish determiner systems are reflective of a
                     referential vs. non-referential contrast, as opposed to the definite vs. indefinite-
                     type contrast found in languages like English. N. Mattina (2002) claims,
                     however, that the Nxa?amxcin determiner system is not reflective of this
                     referential/non-referential distinction, stating (p.283) that “[t]he marking of
                     definiteness and specificity is left to other interacting systems in the grammar”.",[96]

                      6.5        Category-Changing
                             In section 5.1, I briefly discussed an ongoing question in Salish linguistics
                      regarding lexical categories: Do Salish languages distinguish between the
                      categories noun and verb?       Discussion in the literature has generally centred on a
                      noun-verb distinction, but of course the status of adjectives is equally relevant.
                      As noted in section 5.1, | am assuming in this work that the categories noun, verb
                      and adjective are distinguished at the lexical level in Nxa?amxcin, even though
                      any of these three can serve a predicative function at the level of syntax. Having
                      made this assumption, I now turn to the various category-changing operations in
                      Nxa?amxcin that create nouns and adjectives, which are marked on the
                      following derivational stem:
                      (440)       Derivational Stem
                      [Ds NM DIR POS ASP DIM CTR ASP[Lx (Y) VROOT (Z) ]Lx DIM ASP CTR VC RL VAL VC NM ]ps
                            tt                                                    t 1                    i}                     Both general and agentive nominalization are marked in the left most nominalizer
                     position. Adjectival operations are marked by a combination of two
                     morphological spelling operations. The first is suffixal CVC-reduplication,
                     indicated by the rightmost DIM category in (440). This reduplicative process is
                     also used to mark predicates augmentative, hence the label “dimension” in (440).
                     The second involves suffixation to the right edge of the root, indicated by the
                     right most ASP category in (440) as this is the same operation used to mark
                     predicates stative. The right most nominalizer position indicates where
                     instrumental nominalization is marked on the stem.",[246]

                     the present work, it is important to note that there are many stages involved in the
                     process of an independent noun becoming a bound element.                For example,
                     several diachronic lexical suffixes in Nxa?amxcin (i.e. the agentive nominalizer
                      sx*s- and the instrumental nominalizers -min and -tn) are now strictly markers of
                     grammatical operations. The classifier system discussed in section 8.3.5 is also
                     representative of a stage in the diachronic history of bound stems in Nxa?amxcin
                     and Salish in general. In my discussion of bound stems here, I am strictly focusing
                     on one stage. At this stage these bound stems appear to have maintained lexemic
                      status in that they represent elements of various lexical categories; their semantics,
                     though extended, remains much narrower than those of the classifiers; and they
                      do not mark grammatical operations (unlike the agentive and instrumental
                     nominalizers).     The lexical suffixes that I address here reflect what Czaykowska-
                     Higgins (1996, 1998) refers to as referential and nonreferential lexical suffixes,
                     what Czaykowska-Higgins, Willett and Bart (1996) refer to as Root+Lexical
                     Suffix Compounds and Root+Lexical Suffix Predicates, and what Gerdts and
                     Hinkson (1996) refer to as compounding noun incorporation.
                             Basically, two different views have emerged as to the nature of these
                     lexical affix constructions:     (i) they are a syntactic phenomenon involving the
                     combination of stems at the level of syntax; (ii) they are a process of
                     compounding (which I assume here to be a lexical phenomenon).                The main
                     proponents of view (i) are Davis and Saunders (1973) and Saunders and Davis
                     (1975a,b,c).     In their works throughout the seventies, Saunders and Davis support
                     a syntactic approach to lexical suffixation in Bella Coola.          They claim that “the
                     affixation of “lexical suffixes” [...] occurs in the syntactic component of the

                     They note that “not all lexical items [...] have a corresponding lexical suffix, and
                     there appears to be no semantic criterion or feature of these lexical items which
                     differentiates them from those having an associated lexical suffix” (p.356).            In
                     order to account for this, Saunders and Davis propose a syntactic feature [+
                     Referential] which is arbitrarily assigned to lexical items. Those lexical items
                     marked [+ Referential] have a corresponding lexical suffix, while those marked [-

                     lexical items are subject to the optional application of LEXICAL SUFFIX
                     COPY”.     Under this rule, a copy of a lexical item is made.      This lexical item may
                     occupy the agent, patient or adjunct position in a clause.         The copy is in the form
                     of a phonologically distinct lexical suffix. Once the copy is made, the lexical item
                     is deleted by the rule REFERENT DELETION.
                              Czaykowska-Higgins (1996, 1998) also claims that at least a subset of
                     lexical suffixes in Nxa?amxcin combine with stems at the level of syntax.               She
                     refers to these suffixes as “referential lexical suffixes” and states that they “take
                     on the role of Theme or Patient of the Root” and “they seem to satisfy an internal
                     argument of the root and to have meanings which are fairly concrete or
                     referential” (1998:164).     Her description of the referential lexical suffixes suggests
                     that these should be analyzed as incorporated nouns in the syntactic sense of
                     Baker (1988, 1996).      She writes that “referential Lexical Suffixes are units of the
                     syntactic structure, in addition to being units of the morphology.           In this sense
                     they function similarly to the subject and object markers which indicate the
                     person and number of the subject or object of a sentence” (1998:169).
                             A second view on the nature of lexical affixes is a compounding analysis.
                     I assume here such an analysis would entail that the combination of lexical affixes
                     with stems is a lexical process, since compounds are generally assumed to be
                     formed in the lexicon (e.g. Lieber 1983, 1992). An important point in favour of
                     the compounding analysis is the growing evidence in the literature that bound
                     stems are derived from free stem compounding in Salish. Egesdal (1981) was the
                     first to provide clear arguments for a compounding analysis of lexical suffixation
                     using data from a wide variety of Salish languages.         His major arguments are as
                     follows: First, the predicatet+lexical suffix combination is intransitive.          Second,
                     lexical suffixes cannot be pluralized and they cannot be modified by adjectives or
                     determiners.    Third, lexical suffixes have non-referential interpretations.        Fourth,
                     this non-referentiality explains why so many lexical suffix constructions become
                     lexicalized, as is often the case with compounds.         I return to Egesdal’s arguments
                     in section 8.4.3.","[392, 393, 394]"

                     of a predicate, Mithun (1997:361) maintains that they “do not refer to
                     grammatical arguments”.        English translations can be misleading here as nominal
                     lexical suffixes generally get translated as independent arguments of predicates
                     (not surprising given the absence of parallel counterparts in English).             Consider
                     the following examples:
                     (175)   tasaksn                         Mary
                             t’os=akst-nt-n
                             slap=hand-TR-(3AB)-lss          Mary
                             I slapped Mary’s hand.
                     (176)   toer’qxnminn
                             tor’q=xn-min-nt-n
                             kick=foot-RL-TR-(3AB)-1ss
                             I scattered it with my foot.                                                   JM4.5.3
                     While the translations in (175) and (176) suggest that ‘hand’ and ‘foot’ are
                     grammatical arguments of the verb, Mithun (p.361) claims that in such forms the
                     lexical suffixes “simply qualify the meaning of the stem in a general way”.
                     According to Mithun’s analysis of similar examples in Bella Coola, (175) and
                     (176) should be interpreted respectively as ‘I hand-slapped Mary’ and ‘I foot-
                     scattered it’. Thus, while =akst ‘hand’ and =xn ‘foot’ might be interpreted as
                     grammatical arguments of the predicates in the English translations in (175) and
                     (176), they do not actually fill an argument role in Nxa?amxcin, but rather
                     saturate an argument role in the way q”isp ‘cow’ and xA’cin ‘horse’ saturate                     argument roles in the compound examples in (173) and (174).
                             The semantic interpretations of nominal lexical suffixes are also indicative
                     of their generic nature.    Independent referential nominals are much narrower in
                     sense than corresponding lexical suffix nominals.          Consider for example the
                     lexical suffix =wil.    The semantic interpretation of this bound stem has
                     diachronically extended from that of ‘canoe’ to ‘vehicle’, the latter generally
                     referring to any mode of transportation, i.e. car, boat, etc. One of the newer
                     bound stems, =sqaxa?, has a semantic interpretation that has extended from

                     diachronic process of these nouns losing their independent status in the grammar
                     and moving towards grammaticization (Gerdts and Hinkson 1996, Mithun 1997,
                     Hinkson 1999). Semantic broadening, loss of referential status, and a forced
                     generic interpretation are part of this process.
                              Czaykowska-Higgins, Willett and Bart (1996) attempted to test the status
                     of bound stems as referential or non-referential and found that coreferential
                     judgements suggested bound stems can introduce new participants into
                     discourse, an indication of referentiality. Consider the following examples from

                      7.2 Viewpoint Aspect
                               The importance of aspect in Salish languages has been frequently
                      acknowledged by linguists.        Czaykowska-Higgins and Kinkade (1998:28) write
                      that “[a]spect is clearly a central category in the morphology and syntax of Salish
                      languages, but neither its forms nor its functions have been much studied to
                      date”.   Etymological work on Salish aspectual affixes has appeared in Newman
                      (1976) and Kinkade (1996a), and in an unpublished paper by Kinkade and A.
                      Mattina (1981).
                               This section will briefly touch on two different kinds of viewpoint aspect
                      in Nxa?amxcin: perfective and imperfective.            Previous work on viewpoint
                      aspect in Nxa?amxcin is found in Kinkade 1983a and 1996a where it is indicated
                      that the imperfective is marked by a number of prefixes and one suffix while the
                      perfective is unmarked.8      The position of imperfective markers in the word is
                      given in bold in the following schema:

                      prefixed to the derivational stem or, in the case of intransitive predicates, suffixed
                      to the derivational stem.",[313]

                     Numbers (16) and (17) are, respectively, intransitive and applicative examples of
                     the predicate kic ‘arrive’. Numbers (18) and (19) also contain intransitive and
                     applicative examples of the predicate ‘arrive’ but this time with an unexplained
                     -x, resulting in the form kicx. To my knowledge, this -x does not contribute any
                     grammatical or semantic features to the form, and I therefore assume it is an
                     instance of empty morphology.
                             The above examples illustrate a number of possibilites of morphological
                     asymmetry:       (i) more than one morpheme corresponding to one meaning; (ii) one

                      corresponding morpheme; (iv) a morpheme but no corresponding meaning.              The
                      problem with morpheme-based approaches in these cases is tied in with the
                      general assumption that morphemes are assumed to be linguistic signs. If
                      morphemes are comprised of indivisible units of phonological, grammatical and
                      semantic features, how does one account for the fact that certain features do not
                      show a one-to-one correspondence or that some features are absent altogether?
                      As Beard (1995) points out, it is very difficult to do this without resorting to
                      additional stipulations.
                              Morphological asymmetry is not a problem for Beard’s LMBM theory.                In
                      fact, as Beard notes, such lack of one to one correspondence is predictable in his
                      theory given that phonological, grammatical and semantic features are treated
                      separately. Take the example where more than one morpheme is linked to a
                      single meaning, as in (10). In LMBM this is simply a case of the morphological
                      spelling component using two suffixes to mark one lexical/inflectional operation.
                      Conversely, examples like (11), where one morpheme is linked to multiple
                     meanings, involve one spelling operation used to mark more than one
                     derivational/inflectional operation.
                           Zero morphology and empty morphology can also be accounted for within
                     the LMBM framework. Zero morphemes, like those found in (12), (13) and (14),
                     are instances of lexical/inflectional operations that do not trigger morphological
                     spelling operations. Empty morphemes, on the other hand, are morphological
                     spelling operations that do not mark any lexical/inflectional operations.
                             Morpological mismatches like those discussed above are found
                     throughout Nxa?amxcin.         If one analyzes Nxa?amxcin word formation from a
                     morpheme-based perspective, these mismatches must be accounted for. Because
                     these mismatches fall naturally within LMBM theory, I have chosen to analyze
                     Nxa?amxcin word formation within this framework.","[36, 37]"

                      1.2 The Data
                              The Nxa?amxcin data presented in this dissertation comes from three
                      separate sources:    (i) M. Dale Kinkade’s files from the 1960’s and 1970’s which
                      contain numerous dialogues and narratives along with independently elicited
                      examples; (ii) Ewa Czaykowska-Higgins’ field notes from the 1980’s and 1990’s
                      which contain primarily independently elicited examples along with a lengthy
                      narrative; (iii) my own field notes from the 1990’s consisting of independently
                      elicited examples. All of Kinkade’s and Czaykowska-Higgins’ examples cited in
                     the dissertation contain the original record number from the source.            The key to
                     the record numbers is given in Appendix One.            Examples not marked with a
                     record number are from my own field sessions with Agatha Bart, Matilda Bearcub
                      and Norine Smith.
                              The data found throughout this work is presented in a four part structure,
                      illustrated below:

                      With respect to line 1, I have chosen to write the Nxa?amxcin examples
                      throughout this dissertation in phonological form.         This is necessary in order to
                      maintain consistency, as many of Kinkade’s and Czaykowska-Higgins’
                      transcriptions are phonetic while my own are primarily phonological.               Some
                      consonant symbols have been changed to match the phonological system
                      presented in section 4.1. It is generally assumed that schwa is not underlying in
                      Nxa?amxcin, but in order to maintain consistency the following are represented
                      in the data: (i) all transcribed root schwas; (ii) all bound stem schwas; (iii) all
                      epenthetic schwas adjacent to glottals; and (iv) schwas resulting from the nasal to
                      schwa shift.     Excrescent schwas and most epenthetic schwas have been omitted
                      from the data.    I do include such phonological operations as the spreading of
                      retraction and glottalization in the surface forms, even though these are generally
                      not considered to be underlying.       I have also taken the liberty in some cases to
                      separate certain constituents in accordance with my analysis.           For example, the
                      imperative marker ta? is generally written as a suffix; however | analyze it as a
                      clitic and thus write it as a separate element from its host.
                              In line 2 of the four-part structure, I use the symbol “+” for a clitic
                      boundary; the symbol “+” for an infix boundary; and the symbol “=” for a
                      bound stem (lexical affix) boundary.       Translations in line 4 are directly from the
                      source, unless in square brackets indicating some alteration on my part. As
                      gender is not marked in Nxa?amxcin grammar, I have changed instances of
                      “she” and “he” to “s/he” and likewise “her” and “him” to “her/him” in all
                      directly elicited examples (but not in examples from stories and narratives as they
                      are set in a context). While “it” can also be included in many of these cases, in
                      others it may be prohibited on semantic grounds unfamiliar to me, so I therefore
                      exclude it. Translations of ungrammatical examples marked by an asterisk appear
                     in round brackets.","[16, 17]"

                      copied syllable is in fact suffixed onto the initial syllable of the root. This is
                      schematized in (615):
                      (615) VCyVC2C3          >    = VCyVC
                                                       2° C}VCp = C3                      We again see that the first syllable of the root (in this case      C1 VC?) is copied to
                      form the reduplicative augmentative suffix. The augmentative form on the right
                      in (615) indicates that this suffix is not affixed to the right edge of the root, but
                      rather to the right edge of the initial root syllable, the same syllable that was
                      copied.     For CVCC roots as shown in (615), this involves infixation (marked by
                      dots) as the final segment of a CVCC root cannot be included in a maximal CVC
                      syllable.
                                Some examples of this second type of augmentative marking are given

                     5.0 Introduction
                             In this chapter I provide a brief introduction to the syntax of Nxa?amxcin.
                     Discussion of Nxa?amxcin syntax in the Salish literature is limited. The only
                     papers I am aware of are Czaykowska-Higgins 1993d, an unpublished paper
                     which looks at the various types of extraction discussed in the following
                      sections; Willett 1996, an analysis of absolutive case-assignment; Czaykowska-
                     Higgins, Willett and Bart 1996, a discussion of lexical suffix (bound stem)
                     constructions which touches indirectly on syntax; and N. Mattina 2002, a
                     discussion of the determiner system.        Czaykowska-Higgins spent several years
                     conducting field word on Nxa?amxcin syntax and a large portion of the
                     examples in this chapter comes from those sessions. !
                             As this introduction is meant to be descriptive, I do not adopt any
                     particular theoretical approach to clause formation in Nxa?amxcin.              For
                     theoretical approaches on the syntax of other Salish languages, I refer the reader
                     to Gerdts 1988 (Halkomelem); Gardiner 1993 (Shushwap); Jelinek and Demers
                      1994 (Straits Salish); Roberts 1994 (Lillooet); Beck 1995 (Bella Coola and
                     Lushootseed); Currie 1997 (Squamish); Doak 1997 (Coeur d’ Alene);
                     Matthewson 1998 (Lillooet); H. Davis 1999, 2000a (Lillooet); and to the
                     numerous syntax papers that have appeared over the past decade in the
                     proceedings of the International Conference on Salish and Neighbouring
                     Languages.     Kroeber (1991, 1999) provides a theory-neutral overview of syntax
                     across the Salish family.
                             In this chapter, I first address the controversial issue of lexical categories,
                     and then move on to a description of the noun phrase, simple clauses, relative
                             1The description of Nxa?amxcin syntax in this chapter has benefited
                     greatly from Czaykowska-Higgins’ field work and research, especially her work
                     on extraction which was presented at the First University of Victoria Salish
                     Morphosyntax Workshop.","[92, 93]"

                      7.1.1 Intransitive Subjects
                              Intransitive subjects in Nxa?amxcin trigger overt agreement in the form of
                      aclitic. This agreement reflects person, number and grammatical relation for 1st
                      and 2nd person, and number only for 3rd person plural. 3rd person singular is
                      unmarked.     The intransitive subject agreement paradigm is given in (3):

                      The above diagram indicates a split system where person, number and
                      grammatical relation (in this case, “intransitive subject”) are jointly represented
                      by a single morpheme for Ist and 2nd person, while 3rd person is overtly marked
                      solely for number, and this only for the plural. Kinkade (1982b:49) points out
                      that the 1st and 2nd person clitics in (3) can be compared with the transitive
                      subject suffixes in the following section in that these clitics “consist basically of
                      k- plus the transitive subject suffixes except in the third person”.2
                              There is some variation as to the syntactic positioning of the 1st and 2nd
                      person clitics, but they generally appear in first or second position, as in the
                      following examples:
                      (4)     kn      nxt
                              Iss + go
                              I go/went.                                                                 92.1

                               2In his pan-Salish discussion of subject person marking, Kroeber (1999:15)
                      states that “[t]wo types of clitic that code subject person and number (among
                      other things) clearly are (or can be reconstructed as having been) composed of an
                      initial element plus a Subject Suffix [...] In the most important such clitic series,
                      found in virtually all the languages of the family, the initial element is *k’.","[299, 300]"

                             In the previous two sections I discussed and compared both morpheme-
                     based and lexeme-based approaches to morphology.               The reason for the
                     comparison was, in part, to provide the background for this section where I
                     discuss one major advantage of LMBM over morpheme-based theories.
                             There are a number of cross-linguistic morphological patterns that are
                     problematic for a morpheme-based approach to morphology.                 What is often found
                     when examining the morphology of a particular language is that form and
                     function do not always show a one to one correspondence.               For example, in both
                     English and Nxa?amxcin we can find forms where more than one morpheme is
                     linked to a single function. The plural form of child in English is one example.
                     Two separate processes take place when this form is marked plural. First, there is
                     a vowel change from [a1] to [1]; second, there is the addition of the suffix -ren,
                     resulting in [Ciljron]. The following Nxa?amxcin example also illustrates this
                     kind of morphological asymmetry:
                     (10)    tex*mintn
                             tox-min-tn

                     Both -min and -tn are glossed as instrumental suffixes.          In (10) we have one
                     function, instrumental, linked with two forms, -min and -tn.
                             Conversely, it is possible for one morpheme to be linked to a number of
                     different functions.    In the Nxa?amxcin example in (11), person, number and
                     grammatical function can be represented by a single form.                     (11)    ?omcinn

                     the suffix -nn represents (i) Ist person, (ii) singular and (iii) subject function,
                     illustrating that multiple functions can be associated with one form.
                               Another problem for morpheme-based theories is zero morphology:
                     meaning is present but there is no corresponding form. For example, some
                     English resultative nominalizations require affixation while others do not:                      (12)     Resultative Nominalization
                                       Affixed                               Unaffixed

                      In (12), ‘slice’, ‘roll’ and ‘find’ are nominalized without any overt marking to
                     represent this function.     The most common occurrence of zero morphology in
                     Nxafamxcin is the 3rd person absolutive.           3rd person intransitive subjects and
                     transitive objects are never overtly marked, as shown in the following examples:

                     Example (13) contains an intransitive predicate with a third person subject.             While
                     the grammatical features for third person intransitive subject are interpreted in this
                     construction, there is no overt phonological marking to indicate that the subject is
                     third person. Example (14) contains a transitive predicate with a third person
                     object.    Again, the grammatical features are present but there is no phonology
                     present to indicate third person transitive object.
                               Conversely, it is possible for a form to be present without any associated
                     meaning.     Such forms are referred to as empty morphology.          In the following

                      Examples (22) and (23) each contain predicates marked for antipassive voice by
                     the suffix -m. Theme arguments in antipassive constructions surface as obliques
                      and are thus marked by t¢ in (22) and (23). In Nxa?amxcin applicative
                      constructions, a goal/benefactive/malefactive typically surfaces in direct case
                      while a theme argument is marked oblique. This is the case in (24) where the
                      predicate is suffixed with the applicative marker -xit and the theme argument
                      swanax ‘huckleberry’ is preceded by the oblique marker t. Finally, (25) contains
                      a passivized predicate and, as expected with passives, the agent atmupil ‘car’ is
                      realized as an oblique argument.
                              Ergative arguments, i.e. 3rd person transitive subjects, are sometimes
                      marked oblique in Nxa?amxcin.            Some examples are given in (26) to (29):

                      1.3 Outline of the Dissertation
                                This dissertation is very much a data-oriented as opposed to results-
                      oriented piece of work which basically falls into two parts. The first part, chapters
                      2 and 3, provide background information to the second part, the grammatical
                      sketch.    Nxa?amxcin falls under the traditional label “polysynthetic” as words
                      tend to be long and morphologically complex.           As a result, understanding how
                      words are put together in this language is relevant to essentially all aspects of its
                      grammar.      Thus, I begin by outlining the theoretical approach to word formation
                      adopted in this work.     A lexeme-based approach to word formation (Matthews
                      1972, 1991; Aronoff 1976, 1994; Anderson 1992; Beard 1995) has proved to
                      have the best explanatory value in the case of Nxa?amxcin.              Chapter 2 provides
                      an introduction to Beard’s (1995) Lexeme-Morpheme Base Morphology and a
                      brief comparison of this lexeme-based framework with a morpheme-based
                      approach like Lieber (1992).       Note that it is not the purpose here to argue for the
                      superiority of any particular theoretical viewpoint.        I am incorporating a
                      theoretical framework simply as a tool to facilitate a description of the language.
                                In chapter 3, I present an analysis of Nxa?amxcin word structure,
                      specifically focusing on the concepts of root and lexeme.          I argue for a lexemic
                      (as opposed to roof) stem domain in addition to a derivational and inflectional
                      stem at the level of morphological word structure.         I compare my analysis with
                      that of Czaykowska-Higgins (1996, 1998), who proposes a morphological root
                      domain.     I then adopt Czaykowska-Higgins’ analysis that the root is the primary
                      domain at the level of phonological word structure.
                                Having established a theoretical framework and an analysis of the internal
                      structure of words, I then turn to the second part of the dissertation, which is the
                      grammatical sketch. In Chapter 4, I provide a brief introduction to Nxa?amxcin
                     phonology.       Following works by Czaykowska-Higgins and Kinkade, I discuss
                     the segment inventory of the language, the status of schwa, various segmental
                     processes, syllable structure and stress. In Chapter 5, I present a description of
                     Nxa?amxcin syntax. I first briefly look at the question of whether or not lexical
                     categories should be distinguished in Nxa?amxcin based on an ongoing debate
                     in Salish linguistics. Assuming that verbs, nouns and adjectives are distinct

                     categories in Nxa?amxcin, I then turn to the syntax of noun phrases, simple
                     clauses, relative clauses and fronting constructions.
                             The morphology of Nxa?amxcin is an extensive topic, and is divided here
                     into three separate chapters. Chapter 6 is an overview of lexical operations in the
                     language (i.e. derivational morphology). In this chapter, I address the categories
                     of valence, voice, aspect, control, category-changing operations, locative,
                     dimension (i.e. augmentative, diminutive), and relational. Chapter 7 is an
                     overview of inflectional operations (i.e. inflectional morphology).           Categories
                     discussed are person, number and grammatical relation, viewpoint aspect, mood,
                     temporal marking, negation, non-declarative speech (i.e. interrogative, imperative,
                     prohibitive), and nominalization.
                              The focus of Chapter 8 is compounding, for which I distinguish three
                      separate types in Nxa?amxcin.        The first two types involve free stems only and
                      are referred to as af-compounds and unmarked compounds. I refer to the third
                     type as bound stem compounds.            This type of compounding is generally labelled
                      lexical affixation in the literature.    I enter into the debate over whether these
                      bound stem constructions are syntactically engaged or formed by compounding,
                      and I provide morphological and syntactic arguments in support of a compound
                      analysis.
                              Chapter 9 provides a summary of this work.","[17, 18, 19]"

                      8.1 What is a Compound?
                            Anderson (1992:292) defines a compound as “the combination of (two or
                      more) existing words into a new word”. Such a process, he claims, contrasts with
                      derivation and inflection which involve “the application of a Word Formation
                      Rule to a single existing word”.      A word formation rule, Anderson states,
                      “operates on a single word (or stem) to manipulate its phonological form
                      (typically, but not exclusively, by affixation) as well as its other properties.
                     Compounding, in contrast, involves the combining of stems from the lexicon into
                     a quasi-syntactic structure.”
                             While compound structures have been widely noted throughout the cross-
                     linguistic literature, the theoretical literature on compounds is relatively limited.
                     Fabb (1998:82), in his general overview of compounding, indicates that “{t]his is
                     because compounds tend to be less phonologically or morphologically active
                     than derived words, and less syntactically active than phrases: compounds are
                     relatively inert”.   The major theoretical work on compounds can be attributed to

                      DiSciullo and Williams (1987) and Anderson (1992), among others. For the
                      purposes of this work, I adopt Anderson’s (1992) analysis which is in line with
                      Selkirk’s (1982) work on compounds.!
                                Selkirk recognizes an “apparent need for particular rule statements; a
                      general X’ schema for compounding does not adequately characterize the
                      compounding possibilities found in English” (p.13). Anderson claims that
                      compounds are created by a set of word structure rules which “have much the
                      same form as phrase-structure rules, but apply only to lexical categories. Word
                      Structure Rules operate to specify the internal constituency of lexical categories
                      and (optionally) their heads” (p.299). Both Anderson and Selkirk agree that
                      these rules must be specific enough so as to rule out any gaps present in the
                      compounds of a language. Possible stem combinations as well as the feature of
                      “headedness” are very much language-specific, therefore what is available in the
                      grammar of a particular language should be encoded in its word structure rules.
                      For example, a compound of the lexical category verb comprising a verb stem and
                      a noun stem would be realized by the following Word Structure Rule:
                      dg)    VoOVN
                     The word structure rule in (1) indicates that a verb stem and a noun stem can
                     combine to form a single lexical item of the category verb. The head of the
                     compound is underlined.
                             The semantic interpretation of a compound is closely tied with the concept
                     of head.     As Selkirk (p.22) points out, “the nonhead constituent of the compound
                     in some way further defines the head; [...] the head is, intuitively speaking, the
                     nucleus of the compound”. For example, a nonhead can fill a role in the
                     argument structure of a head, but not the other way around.            Selkirk (p.22) notes,
                             1I should clarify that while Anderson’s view of compounding finds root in
                     Selkirk’s work on word structure, their views on derivation and inflection are
                     radically different in that Selkirk takes a morpheme-based approach to word
                     formation while Anderson adopts a lexeme-based view.","[349, 350]"

                              The glottal infix, used to mark inchoative aspect on strong roots, raises an
                      interesting question regarding the prosodic structure of roots.          Kinkade
                      (1989b:117) points out that reduplication processes on bases containing the infix
                      -f- show that -?- is recognized as part of the root. Thus, in all cases where the
                      word formation rules for C2-out-of-control and CVC-augmentative take place on
                      an inchoative base with the infix -?-, the glottal stop is recognized as C2.37 This is
                      illustrated in the following examples:

                     position.   In the C2-reduplication forms in (290) and (291), the second consonant
                     of the root is copied (section 3.3.2.1). It is clear that the inchoative infix -?- is
                     recognized as C2 in these forms as the glottal stop is targeted for reduplication.","[211, 212]"

                      3.3.2   The Phonological Root
                                Czaykowska-Higgins (1996, 1998) claims that a root domain is the primary
                      level of both phonological and morphological structure in Nxa?amxcin word
                      formation.        In the previous section, I argued for a lexemic stem as the primary level
                      of morphological structure in Nxa?amxcin.                 In this section, I adopt Czaykowska-
                      Higgins’ claim that the root is the primary level in Nxa?amxcin phonological
                      structure.
                                Given Aronoff’s definition of root introduced above, in the study of word
                      formation one would expect to find one root per word (excluding compounds)
                      since it is defined to be “morphologically unanalyzable”.               Consider the following
                      examples containing the root Vcok ‘hit (by throwing)’:
                      (21)      cakncas                     t      xr ut

                                It’s John who’s hitting me.                                                    92.223

                      While examples (21) to (23) all have different surface forms, they share the same
                      root Vcak ‘hit (by throwing)’.            [cok] is the phonological form of the lexeme HIT. It
                      contains no phonological representations for lexical or inflectional operations,
                      and cannot be dissected any further for morphological content.
                                Now consider examples like (24) to (26) which contain the predicate
                      ‘swim’:

                      As examples (24) to (26) illustrate, the phonological representation of the lexeme
                      SWIM is [nak’Srm].     From a diachronic perspective, this stem appears to be
                      comprised of the prefix na-/n-, which marks the positional meaning ‘in’; the root
                      Vk’or which, diachronically, is most likely the root Vk’or ‘to cut’; and finally the
                      suffix -m, generally labelled middle voice. In the above examples we see that the
                      stem nak’drm is targeted for prefixation marking the cislocative in (24), and for
                      compounding in (25). In (26), however, it appears that the initial segment of the
                      stem, [n], is bypassed when reduplication takes place. These examples show that
                      with respect to morphological spelling operations, two stems must be isolated
                      within the phonological representation of the lexeme SwIM.            The first is the root
                      \k’or; the second is the lexemic stem nak’érm.          If the phonological representation
                      of the lexeme SWIM is nak’drm, how can the segments [k’ar] be isolated as a base
                      for morphological spelling operations, as appears to be the case with the
                      reduplicated form in (26)?
                              In cases like this, not just any segments can be isolated and targeted for
                     morphological spelling.       It is specifically the root that constitutes the base for
                     word formation within the lexemic stem. This is evidenced in English examples
                      like understand vs. understood where the root Vstand is clearly salient with the
                     past alternate being marked in identical fashion with the verb stand.               It has been
                     widely observed that roots are distinctive and unique across languages.
                     Beckman (1999:183-184) notes that “[c]ross-linguistically, root morphemes
                     exhibit a more extensive and more marked inventory of segments, and of prosodic

                     exhibit privileged behavior in the presence of phonological alternations,

                               Czaykowska-Higgins (1996, 1998) claims the root is an independent level
                     in Nxa?amxcin word formation based on the fact that a select number of spelling
                     operations target the root only.      The primary evidence in support of an
                     independent root level in word formation can be divided into two types:             (4)
                     operations that target the prosodic structure of the root; and (ii) spelling
                     operations that target the left edge of the root.       I discuss each of these in turn
                     below.","[54, 55, 56]"

                     In (45) the inchoative marker -?- appears inside the root Vq""uc, resulting in g™u?c.
                     The predicate taqlx in (46) is marked out-of-control by the reduplication of the
                      second consonant, resulting in taqglx.         Both of these categories are represented
                     by forms that not only appear close to the root but actually surface inside the
                     root. If inflectional morphemes appear outside derivational ones, then both
                     inchoative and out-of-control categories must be derivational since their markers
                      surface within the root domain.

                      segments(s) of the root (CjaC- or C;- respectively), and these reduplicative
                     prefixes appear at the immediate left edge of the root, as in (47) and (48).
                      Likewise, the stative and inchoative suffixes -t and -p always surface at the
                      immediate right edge of the root, as in (49) and (50). Given that all of the
                      morphemes highlighted in (47) to (50) appear adjacent to the root without any
                      possibility of intervening material, I assume they are markers of derivational
                      operations.
                              (ii) Semantic Relevance.        The position of derivational and inflectional
                      morphology with respect to the root directly ties in with the second observation
                      which centres on the semantic contribution of derivational and inflectional rules
                      to the word.    Scalise (1988:563) claims that derivational rules “change the
                      conceptual meaning of their base”, while inflectional rules “change the
                      grammatical meaning of their base”. This is addressed in detail in Bybee 1985,
                      who states (p.99) that:
                              [...] inflectional meaning is always very general, indeed, often so general as
                              to be redundant in context, and it is always transparent in the sense that its
                              combination with a stem always produces a predictable meaning.
                              Derivational meaning, on the other hand, has more semantic content and
                              often produces idiosyncratic meanings in combination with different
                              lexical stems.
                      According to Bybee, the greater the semantic relevance to the root, the closer the
                      morpheme will appear to the root.
                              The locative, relational, and limited control categories all provide the root
                      with some form of semantic extension, as illustrated in (51) to (53):

                      The examples in (51) illustrate the semantic contribution of a locative prefix to the
                      predicate.    The root Viot’ in isolation means ‘wet’, as in (51a). When the locative
                      prefix kat- is affixed in (51b), the predicate takes on the additional meaning that
                      the location of the wet state is on a flat surface.     The relational category also
                      contributes additional semantic properties to the predicate as it indicates some
                      action either moving away from the agent towards another entity, or moving
                      towards the agent.     This is illustrated in (52b) where the combination of the root
                      Vyovw ‘strong’, the bound stem =akst ‘hand’, and the relational suffix -min
                      indicate that something is being forced by hand either away from or towards the
                      agent.    The limited control category provides the additional meaning that
                      something was done accidentally or with difficulty.          As we see in (53b), when the
                      limited control suffix is added to the reanalyzed stem yarmin ‘push’, the
                      interpretation of the predicate becomes ‘push accidentally’.
                               All three of the above categories provide additional features to the
                      predicate beyond that of grammatical features.          These three categories extend the
                      meaning of the predicate in such ways that there are fundamental changes to the
                      meaning of the predicate if these are removed.         As a result, these categories
                      should be considered derivational.        Sentential aspect, however, has the opposite
                      effect on a predicate in that any change in sentential aspect has no effect
                      whatsoever on the semantic interpretation of the predicate of a clause.            Consider
                      the following two examples:

                      The example in (54a) appears in the unmarked perfective form, giving one a
                      closed view of the activity that took place (i.e. it is seen from start to finish). The
                      example in (54b) provides an alternate view as it is marked for imperfective
                      aspect.        In this case an open-ended view of the activity is presented with no
                      specific start or end-point.         If we change the view from closed to open, the
                      semantic integrity of the predicate is not compromised.           Whether the predicate is
                      perfective or imperfective, the meaning of the verb, in this case ‘to eat’, remains
                      constant.        This indicates that sentential aspect should be considered inflectional.
                                (iii) Ability to Change Features in Lexical Representations.             Regarding
                      the third criterion, there is a fundamental distinction between derivation and
                      inflection with respect to what each of these can do.           Scalise (1988) remarks that
                      rules of derivation seem to be more powerful than those of inflection, observing
                      (p.562) that “given a lexical representation, [derivational rules] can change
                      virtually every single bit of information attached to it, while [inflectional rules]
                      can change only a fixed set of linguistic information (gender, number, etc.)”.
                      Operations that clearly have an effect on the lexical representation of a lexeme
                      are valence-changing categories.            These categories can manipulate how many
                      participants are involved in a situation by changing the subcategorization
                      features of a lexeme.           One example of this is the category transitive which creates

                      The predicate k”ax” ‘wake up’ in (55a) has not undergone any valence-
                      changing operation and, therefore, subcategorizes for a single argument.              In (55b)
                      the same predicate is marked for the operation transitive resulting in two direct
                      arguments.    Because valence-changing categories can make changes to the
                      lexical representation of a lexeme, I include them in the derivational stem level.
                              The voice categories are another example of operations that can alter the
                      lexical representations of lexemes.      This category can alter which argument in a
                      lexical representation will assume the role of subject of the predicate.           Example
                      (56a) illustrates the unmarked active voice.       In this example the agent is the
                      subject of the predicate c’alx ‘scratch’ while the theme serves as the direct
                      object. If we compare this with example (56b) marked for passive voice, the
                      theme, in this case Paci xaxal’a? ‘baby’, is now the subject of the clause while
                      the agent, pus ‘cat’, appears as an oblique object.

                               In this chapter I presented a brief introduction to the syntax of
                     Nxa?amxcin. | first outlined the parts of speech, touching briefly on the
                      controversy surrounding lexical categories in Salish languages where some
                      scholars recognize a noun-verb distinction while others do not.            Adopting the
                     views of the former, I then moved on to a discussion of the noun phrase.                I
                     introduced the four determiners and three demonstratives that have been
                     identified for Nxa?amxcin, and then looked at oblique and locative prepositions.
                     In the final section on noun phrases, I reviewed the syntax of genitive phrases.
                               I then turned to the syntax of various types of clauses. I illustrated that
                      simple clauses have VS word order for intransitive, and the unmarked VOS for
                     transitive clauses, noting that there is some freedom of word order as VSO
                      constructions are also possible.     Relative clauses were examined with the data
                     illustrating that the relative clause head could either precede or follow the relative
                     clause.    In addition, relative clauses can be headless in Nxa?amxcin.             I then
                     looked at fronting constructions which involve the fronting of a NP/PP to pre-
                     predicate position. There are three types of fronting:         (i) unmarked; (ii) quasi-
                     clefting (the fronted argument is followed by a subordinating particle and the
                     residue has the surface form of a relative clause as it is preceded by an oblique
                     marker); and (iii) clefting (identical in structure to quasi-clefting except there is a
                     deteminer in lieu of a subordinating particle).
                               Finally, I looked at the properties and distribution of the particle wa, which
                     is prevalent throughout the Nxa?amxcin data.            On the surface it appears to mark
                     (optionally) absolutive arguments; however it is linked with the transitive subject
                     in topical object constructions.     Its position in fronting constructions is curious in
                     that when absolutive arguments (or subjects of topical object constructions) are
                     fronted, wa appears to mark the residue as opposed to the fronted NP.
                               Having looked at how Nxa?amxcin clause constructions are formed, in the
                     next three chapters I examine numerous processes involved in forming
                     Nxaramxcin words.        I start in the following chapter by discussing operations that
                     take place at the derivational stem level.","[130, 131]"

                      The stative-transitive predicate wik ‘see’ is marked transitive by the suffix -#t in
                      (50), as opposed to the expected transitive marker -nt. This is the same suffix
                      used to mark applicative and external possession operations.            The Ist sg. object
                      marker -m in (50) indicates that stems marked by -#t take object suffixes from the
                      second paradigm.      Example (51) contains another stative transitive-type
                      predicate, sux” ‘know’, which is also marked transitive by the suffix -#t. Note
                      that the predicate in (52) is marked imperfective by the prefix ?ac-. Imperfectives
                      are generally marked transitive by the suffix -stu, but example (51) suggests that
                      -it is the transitive marker for both perfectives and imperfectives in these cases. !2                              12] do have a counter example to this where the predicate sux” ‘know’ is
                      marked transitive by the suffix -stu, suggesting that both options (-#t and -stu) are
                      possible.

                     Both of the above examples contain nouns marked for operations traditionally
                     associated with verbs.     In (4), the noun yalmix” ‘chief’ is marked causative,
                     reflexive, and imperative by the suffixes -stu, -cut, and the clitic ta?, respectively.
                     In example (4), the noun phrase ?ani yalmix™m ‘the chief’ is marked past by the
                     temporal clitic ay’.
                             While the examples in (1) to (5) show that verbs, nouns and adjectives are
                     treated similarly with respect to certain properties, there are a number of reasons
                     to consider at least verbs and nouns separate lexical categories.          (Unfortunately,
                     the picture is unclear for adjectives as the necessary data for comparison is
                     unavailable.) First, possessive marking (section 7.1.4) is specific to the category

                     nominalizing operation first. Also, morphological marking of irrealis mood is
                     sensitive to the lexical category of the stem; verbs are marked by the prefix kas-
                     while nouns are marked by the prefix kat-.4
                               It is not the purpose of this work to enter into the verb-noun-adjective
                     debate.     In this work I will assume that Nxa?amxcin makes a lexical distinction
                     between verbs, nouns and adjectives.         In addition I will assume, based on
                     examples like (1), (4) and (3), that verbs, nouns and adjectives can all have a
                     predicative function at the syntactic level in Nxa?amxcin.","[95, 96]"

                                The word structure rule in (39), repeated below as (90), also creates right-

                     The above rule indicates that an adjective, noun or verb stem can combine with a
                     noun stem to form a complex noun stem.           Some examples involving adjectives are

                     One clear example is found in Kinkade 1998b:

                             There are three right-edge bound stems that are not accounted for by the

                     that conveys an adverbial meaning.          Consider the following examples:

                                     t-hal’-hal’x”=ana?

                     In (98), the bound stem =ana? has the nominal interpretation of ‘ear’, while in
                     (99) it has the adverbial meaning ‘all over’.        Examples like (99) suggest that the
                     following word structure rule is operative in Nxa?amxcin:
                     (100) V > V Adv                              Two right-edge bound stems appear to have extended their core nominal
                     meaning to a verbal meaning.           The bound stem =ank has the core meaning
                      ‘stomach’ but is also glossed as ‘want’.       Compare the following examples:
                     (101)    q*tnank
                              q’tun=ank

                              big stomach (fat or pregnant)

                              Likewise the right-edge bound stem =aya? has the core meaning ‘head’
                     which has been extended the verbal meaning ‘pretend’, as shown in (103) and
                     (104):

                             Examples (103) and (104) suggest that the following word structure rule is
                     present in the language:
                     (105)        VoVV                     The rule in (105) indicates that two verb stems can combine to form a complex
                     verb stem.
                             In the previous section we saw consistency between word structure rules
                     used to form a?-, unmarked and right-edge bound stem compounds.                     The word
                     structure rules in (100) and (105) are inconsistent with the pattern and apply to
                     only one or two bound stems respectively.          I can only speculate at this point but I
                     suspect that examples (99), (102) and (104) are not instances of bound stem
                     compounds, but rather the forms =ana?, =ank and =aya? are functioning as
                     grammatical morphemes in these examples.
                             Hinkson (1999:118) has already indicated that “[t]he suffix *an’/nak is
                     attested with desiderative force and acquires grammatical meaning in the
                     Southern Interior Salish languages Columbian and Okanagan”.                It is possible that
                      =aya? ‘pretend’ could also be subsumed under the category mood.                    With respect
                     to =aya? ‘all over’, we have already seen the prefix ni?- ‘among a bunch of
                     things’ analyzed as a grammatical marker, and it would therefore not be a stretch
                     to consider =aya? ‘all over’ as a grammatical morpheme.
                             It is very difficult to prove the status of these bound stems as lexical or
                     grammatical, and I will leave this question open for future research.","[373, 374, 375, 376]"

                      5.4 Relative Clauses
                              A relative clause has a special modificational function. It is quite common
                      for relative clauses in Salish languages to carry morphological operations distinct
                      from those found in main clauses; however Kroeber (1999:272) points out that

                     relative clause than do other branches of Salish and also to assign relative clauses
                     inflection that is not distinct from that of other clause types”.
                             Nxa?amxcin relative clauses do not require any specific relative clause
                     morphology on the predicate.         Subject and object agreement follow the same
                     paradigms as that of main clauses. The relative clause construction consists of a
                     relativized nominal optionally followed by the oblique marker 4.9 Both of these
                      are followed by the clausal modifier (i.e. the relative clause). I assume this clause
                      contains a gap which would otherwise be filled by the relativized element.            The
                     Nxa?amxcin relative clause is schematized in (58):
                      (58)           NP;     @)    pl       _il
                                       Pi                      The NP/PP in (58) is coreferenced with a gap within the IP, indicating that it (or
                      some operator coreferenced with it) originated within the IP. Because the
                      oblique marker is becoming optional, I have enclosed it in brackets.           There is no
                      relative pronoun in the above schema as relative clauses across the Salish family
                      do not contain relative pronouns (Kroeber 1999:270).
                              A wide range of grammatical relations can be relativized in Nxa?amxcin.
                      Examples of transitive subjects targeted for relativization are given below. (The
                      relativized element is in boldface; the relative clause is marked with square
                      brackets.):

                      clause constructions is unclear, but I will adopt the label oblique here for
                      descriptive purposes. Kroeber (1999) employs the label attributive for t in the
                      context of relative clauses.","[108, 109]"

                     possible with the genitive marker, when present, “attaching either to the right or
                     left of the possessor within the scope of the article” (N. Mattina 2002:267).           The

                      [...]. Non-demonstrative ?ani is formed on a root that is less productive, but
                     which has cognates in other Interior Salishan languages.           The increment ?a-
                     found in each article is a formal determinant of the Moses-Columbia article set.”
                      Some examples of the general article are given in (6) to (9):

                     Note that while the general article ?ani is usually translated as ‘the’, speakers
                     sometimes use either ‘that’ or ‘this’ in translations, as in (7).
                             Examples of the other three articles, which seem to convey a deictic sense,
                     are given in (10) to (15):

                     have been marked for possession.            In addition, more than one article can precede
                     the same noun, as illustrated in (16):

                             N. Mattina (p.265) also points out that, with the exception of ?ani, all three
                     determiners can have a predicative function, as shown in (17) and (18):

                             Turning now to the demonstrative pronoun system, N. Mattina (2002:264)
                     lists the following for Nxa?amxcin:
                     (19)    Demonstrative Pronouns
                             Pixa?     ‘this one (here)’
                             Pica      ‘this one (there)’
                             Pita      ‘that one’
                     N. Mattina points out that these demonstratives contain the same roots as the last
                     three articles listed in (5).   She indicates (p.263) that “[t]he demonstrative
                     particles have the increment 7i- (and concomitant regulatization of the root vowel
                     to a) where the articles have ?a-; the same roots are used for both.”
                             There is little information available on demonstrative pronouns in
                     Nxa?amxcin, and I am unable to discuss in any detail the particulars of their
                     distribution.   N. Mattina does point out that demonstratives can have a
                     predicative function in Nxafamxcin, as shown in the following examples:

                     As we will see in section 5.6, the position of the particle wa in (21) suggests that
                      ‘grandfather’s house’ is an absolutive argument, i.e. subject of an intransitive
                     predicate.
                                 I now turn to a discussion of oblique noun phrases in the following
                      section.","[96, 97, 98, 99, 100]"

                      (32)    sac’im’xox”
                              sac-?im’x-mix
                              IM-move-IM-(3AB)
                              S/he’s moving.                                  Czaykowska-Higgins          1993a:208
                      In (32), the strong root V?im’x ‘move’ is affixed with the recessive imperfective
                      suffix -mix and stress remains on the full vowel of the root. With respect to weak
                      roots, however, stress shifts to the recessive suffix, as shown in (33):
                      (33)    cokncas
                              cok-nt-sa-s
                              hit-TR-1s0-3ER
                              S/he hit me.                                     Czaykowska-Higgins         1993a:216
                      The full vowel of the recessive suffix -sa in (33) is the only full vowel in this form
                      and therefore triggers stress shift to the right.
                              In addition to the interaction of the two classes of roots and suffixes,
                      features of cyclicity, extrametricality and accent all play a role in the Nxa?amxcin
                      stress system.   At this point I will refer the reader to Czaykowska-Higgins 1993a
                      for the full details as they are long and complex, and beyond the scope of this
                      work.","[90, 91]"

                       Examples (214) and (216) show that it is possible to form wh-questions without
                       the bound stem; however, when bound stems relating to the wh-element surface
                       on the predicate, the examples are rejected, as in (215) and (217).          If Nxa?amxcin
                       bound stem constructions were formed under the same syntactic conditions as
                       noun incorporation, we would expect (217) to be grammatical under Baker’s
                       analysis.    The fact that this is not the case further suggests that the structures of
                       incorporated noun clauses and bound stem clauses are quite different.","[424, 425]"
