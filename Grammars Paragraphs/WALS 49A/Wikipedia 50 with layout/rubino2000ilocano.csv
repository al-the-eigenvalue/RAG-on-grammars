"SYNOPSIS FOR LINGUISTS: Ilocano, like its sister Philippine languages, is a predicate-initial
language with a complex, head-marking, highly-prefixing morphology. Affixes denote a wide
range of grammatical categories including aspect, focus, number, volition, transitivity, recip-
rocity, and some lexical categories such as pretense, smell, and relative size. Noun phrases may
function as predicates and arguments. As arguments, they are usually preceded by noun markers
(articles or demonstratives) that inflect for case (core vs. oblique), number (singular vs. plural),
and time. Articles also inflect for reference (common vs. personal). Pronouns inflect for person,
number, and case (ergative, absolutive, and oblique). There is an inclusive/exclusive distinction
in the first person plural forms. When core (non-oblique) pronouns are used with predicates, they
are enclitic. There is a pervasive particle (nga/a) used to link related constituents (heads and
attributes) called a ligature (§12), and a number of uninfecting adverbial particles (§7.2). All
roots (non-p/articles) may be nominalized or verbalized by morphology or syntactic function.",[41]

arguments by enclitic pronouns, the actor of the action is encoded by the =ko series pronouns
(ergative case), while the non-actor takes absolutive case (=ak series pronouns). All noun phrases
in these cases are given core case marking; all other nouns are peripheral and encoded in the
oblique.       nakita                                            saw (transitive)

"        The prefix ma- (perfective form na-) is also used to form involuntary or stative verbs (and
adjectives) that take only one core argument in the absolutive case.       maldaang                     to be sad
       maüyong                      to be crazy

       /natnäg                      to fall        With the suffix -an, the prefix ma- indicates nonvolitional or abilitative agency. The
resulting verbs can be intransitive resultatives (in many cases where the agent is expressed in the
root) or transitive potentives, where the agent is expressed in the ergative case.",[65]
"3.2 DemonstrativesIlocano demonstratives, like the articles, also inflect for plurality and case. There are no special
forms, however, to differentiate personal nouns from non-personal ones. Ilocano demonstratives
are traditionally classified with regard to three degrees of space and time.",[53]

verb is that of 'actor' (semantic agent or experiencer). Actor focus verbs may be formed with the
prefixes ag- (durative), ma-lmaka- (stative or potentive), or the infix -um- (punctual or
inchoative). Transitive verbs may be detransitivized with mang- (distributive).","[61, 62]"

preceded by the complementizer no in this case:        Ammök no sinnö ti nagturpös.

"        Certain affixes, however, such as -en and -an, encode transitive frames that may assign
two nominals in core case, an agent (actor) encoded in the ergative case, and a nonactor (patient,
location, recipient, benefactor, reason, or theme, etc.) encoded in the absolutive case. Since the
absolutive argument in focus for these verbs is a nonagent/actor, they are called ""goal focus
verbs"". Because these verbs can take two core nominals, they are grammatically transitive.",[61]

                                  12. The Ligature (ng)a
The ligature (or linker) is a connective particle used in Philippine languages to connect various
syntactic parts of a sentence (heads and attributes). The Ilocano ligature has two written variants:
nga before vowels and a before consonants. However, in speaking, the ligature nga is usually
preferred regardless of phonetic environment.
        Among the many uses of the ligature are the following: connect adjectives and nouns,
introduce complements or appositional constituents of all syntactic categories, separate the
negative particle saan from the verb in negative declarations, and separate repeated words in
emphatic constructions:       Sao a sao ni Kondring.                         Kondring is always talking.
       naimas a digo                                  delicious broth
       Saankami a napan.                              We didn't go.
       Nalaka a daiten.                               It is easy to sew it.
       ti kabsatko a lalaki                           my brother
       ti nuang a napigsa                             the strong water buffalo       When the ligature (ng)a joins non-predicative syntactic elements, notice that the two
conjoined constituents do not predicate:       Naimas ti bibingka.                    The rice cake is delicious,
       naimas a bibingka                      delicious rice cake       Ni Erlinda ti maestra.                 Erlinda is the teacher.

                                  13. Clause CombiningVarious processes are involved when Ilocano clauses are combined. In certain combinations, one
clause becomes a well-integrated (dependent) constituent of another. These include relative
clauses and complement clauses. Clauses may also combine where neither is the superordinate
clause; both may function independently. Such is the case with coordinate clauses. This section
will discuss the following clause types:        13.1   Relative clauses
        13.2   Complement clauses
        13.3   Adverbial clauses
        13.4   Coordination
13.1 Relative clausesA relative clause is a clause that modifies the head of the noun phrase (NP) to which it belongs; it
'relates' a piece of information to its head noun. Relative clauses are linked to their head noun in
Ilocano with the ligature (ng)a: NP = head noun + ligature (ng)a + relative clause.       ti tao a manakem                       the man that is wise
       ti balasang nga agur-uray kaniak       the maiden who is waiting for me
       ti al-alia a nakitana                  the ghost that he saw       The head noun taking a relative clause must be in the absolutive position with respect to
the predicate of the relative clause. A head noun that functions as an actor will take an actor
focus verb, a head noun that functions as a patient will take a patient focus verb, etc.       ti tao a nagsurat                      the man who wrote (actor)
       ti mannala a sinuratanna               the dancer to whom he wrote (direction)
       ti sarsuela a sinuratna                the opera he wrote (patient)
       ti nagan nga insuratna                 the name he wrote down (theme)
       ti ubing a nagsangit                   the child who cried (actor)
       ti balasang a nakitak                  the maiden I saw (nonactor)
       ti al-alia a nakakita kaniak           the ghost that saw me (actor)
       ti tukak nga innalada                  the frog that they got (patient)
       diay babai a kinasaok                  the girl with whom I spoke (comitative)
13.2   Complement clausesComplement clauses are those that can be considered as embedded arguments of a matrix
predicate. Most complement clauses have the potential to stand alone as a complete phrase,
except those that are 'reduced', sharing a co-referential argument with the matrix clause that is
only overtly expressed in the matrix clause.","[80, 81]"
"
Patient focusPatient focus verbs take an argument in the absolutive case whose semantic role with respect to
the verb is that of a 'patient' (an affected entity or target of the action of the verb). The patient
focus suffix is -en (perfective -in-). The suffix -en typically forms transitive verbs in which the
absolutive argument is directly affected by a volitional actor.",[62]

                              A Note on the Orthography
In orthographic systems that have been used to write Ilocano since the 1600s, two systems have
predominated. The older system is based on Spanish orthography and the newer system is the
standardized alphabet accepted for the Tagalog language, as used in the weekly Ilocano
magazine, Bannawag. The orthography is mostly phonemically based for the consonants, but not
for the vowels. Among the five vowels (a, e, i, o, u) used in Ilocano writing, the letter e
corresponds to two separate phonemes in the southern dialects, a mid front vowel, and a high
back unrounded vowel. The orthographic symbols o and u originally represented one phoneme
with alternative pronunciations in specific environments (o word-finally). Due to the large
number of foreign loans in the language and high degree of bilingualism, however, these letters
now represent two contrastive vowel sounds, e.g. oso 'bear' vs. uso 'use, in fashion'.
xiv * IntroductionThe older Spanish system vs. the modern systemAlthough perhaps the majority of Ilocanos continue to use the older Spanish spelling system, I
choose to abide by the conventions accepted in most modem publications and the Bannawag
magazine. Here, I briefly outline the two systems:       Vowels are the same in both: a, e, i, o, u\ where e represents two distinct sounds in the
southern dialects (see Phonology).","[13, 14]"
"6.1 The categories of verbs6.1.2 Focus (verbal orientation) and transitivityOne notable distinction present in every affixed verb is the encoding of what has been termed
'focus' in Philippine linguistics, referring to formal marking that reflects the privileged syntactic
status of the absolutive noun phrase. Ilocano verbs assign 'focus' to their absolutive nominal
(=ak pronoun NP), the nominal in the most syntactically privileged position in terms of the
semantic and grammatical relationship the nominal has with the verb. Simple intransitive verbs
such as ag-, -um- and mang- verbs, for instance, take at most one core nominal as the argument
whose semantic relationship to the verb is usually 'actor' or single-argument 'experiencer'.",[61]
"        No kayatmon ti mangan, ibagam ta idasarankan.
        'If you want to eat already, say so and I'll set the table for you'Instrumental   focusThe instrumental focus places the instrument or tool used to carry out the action in the absolutive
case. It is formed by the prefix pag- (past: pinag). Because of the semantic and pragmatic nature
of this particular focus, derived pag- words usually appear in discourse as non-predicative nouns.",[64]
"Benefactive focusThe absolutive argument of benefactive verbs is usually the beneficiary of an action, but in some
cases the person encoded in the absolutive case can be seen as having the action of the verb done
in his/her place rather than for his/her benefit. It is formed with the circumfix i- -an (past: in -an),
morphologically a combination of a theme prefix and a directional suffix.",[64]
"
                                              6. Verbs
An interesting feature about Ilocano (and other Philippine languages) is that every root in the
language that can act as a noun can also be transformed into a verb by means of syntactic place-
ment or verbalizing morphology. Because the initial position is reserved for the predicate, any
noun in that position may take on a predicative function. Conversely, verbs may occur in nominal
functions (after articles or demonstratives). Ilocano does not have a copular (to be) verb:       kayo                    tree; It is a tree.
       Napan.                  He went,
       ti napan                the one who went       daytoy kayo             this tree
       Kayo daytoy.            This is a tree.       lalaki                  boy.
       Lalaki.                 He is a boy.
                                                                                Grammar Outline * lxi        There are numerous morphological affixes that combine with roots to give them verblike
qualities (i.e., aspect [tense], mode, volition, transitivity). Words with these particular
morphemes will be considered 'verbs' in this grammar sketch, forming a separate lexical class
from nouns.","[60, 61]"
"Com itative focusThe comitative focus places the party with whom the action is performed in the absolutive case.
It is formed by the prefix ka- (past: kina-). Like verbs in instrumental focus, these ka- lexical
items behave more like prototypical nouns but may also appear predicatively and denote aspect.",[64]
"1.2 The enclitic absolutive pronouns (=ak series)The enclitic absolutive pronouns are referred to in the dictionary as the =ak series pronouns to
avoid confusion among many linguistic traditions of naming them (absolutive, nominative,
focus). In this grammar sketch, we will refer to them as absolutives, as they encode both single
arguments of intransitive verbs and patient (object) arguments of transitive verbs, the absolutive
category. As second position enclitics, they usually attach to the first constituent of their phrase.
The absolutive (=ak series) paradigm is as follows:         Independent              =ak series pronoun               English gloss         siâk                     =ak3                             I

Intransitive verbs may take an indefinite notional patient or object in the oblique case.,[52]

                                      THE DICTIONARYThe present dictionary is a culmination of my research as a Ph.D. graduate student and lecturer in
the Department of Linguistics at the University of Califomia-Santa Barbara and a senior
research associate at the Research Centre for Linguistic Typology at the Australian National
University. I began ""collecting"" Ilocano words, however, in the early eighties, reading the
weekly Ilocano magazine, Bannawag, which was often brought home by visiting or migrating
relatives. It was not until my college years at the University of California at Los Angeles that I
was aware that an Ilocano dictionary had been published in 1956 by Morice Vanoverbergh,
which served as a skeleton for the present dictionary.
        As any Ilocano can confirm, the Ilocano language is not spoken uniformly in the northern
provinces of Luzon. Regional variations in intonation, grammar, and the lexicon have
necessitated several trips to all the Ilocano speaking regions, which resulted in my meeting many
esteemed Ilocano poets and writers and monolingual Ilocano speakers who served as consultants
for regional and literary vocabulary. Members of the Philippine Information Society in San
Fernando and Bangued, the Superior Court of Laoag, and DZNL radio in San Fernando
graciously volunteered their time to aid me in this respect, providing much encouragement to
complete this project. The Sanglay Law Office of San Fernando, La Union assisted me in many
matters while I was outside the Philippines.
        The root-based format of the dictionary matches that of previously published dictionaries
of languages of similar typologies. As the morphology (affix system) in Philippine languages is
rather complex, compiling a nonroot-based dictionary might take the greater part of a lexico-
grapher's life before a good portion of the important words in the language were documented. It
is my belief that a root-based dictionary would be more beneficial to native Ilocanos, students of
Ilocano, linguists, and anthropologists because it allows the users to see affixal permutations and
better understand the essence of the complex morphological system.
        The grammatical affixes were put into the dictionary in the same section as lexical roots.
This was done merely for convenience in word searching by the user who is not expected to
determine the morpheme class before looking up each word. It may also be a useful method of
arranging lexicons of languages with highly prefixing typologies such as Ilocano.
        Common Ilocano words or bases where the boundary between the root and affix has been
phonetically fused may be found in the dictionary under independent entries to simplify
dictionary searches. For instance, the word sumrek 'to enter' from the root serrek 'enter' may be
found under both entries. Even native Ilocano speakers experience some difficulty determining
the lexical roots in these cases.
        A short introduction to Ilocano grammar has been included to outline rudimentary aspects
of Ilocano phonology, morphology, and syntax as an aid to natives and nonnatives alike. As the
                                                                                   Introduction * xiiishort grammar is merely a brief synopsis of the system, it is broken down in terms of
morphological classes, exemplifying paradigms that may aid users of the dictionary in their
lexical searches or in constructing simple sentences. It is by no means to be taken as a thorough
representation of the grammar of the language. Those interested in seeing the most thorough
grammar of the language are encouraged to try to acquire a copy of my Ph.D. dissertation or
Morice Vanoverbergh's 1955 Iloko grammar.
        Nonnative Ilocano speakers using this dictionary will find the Affix Cross-Reference List
useful when looking up polymorphemic (derived and inflected) words. It lists the most common
prefixes and all suffixes, infixes, reduplications, and enclitics, which are written in Ilocano
orthography as joined to their roots. Since derivational morphology in Ilocano is extremely
productive, not all derivations are given with each root. I have tried to include the most common
derivational patterns with the most high-frequency roots for users who are not yet familiar with
the morphological system of the language, and also to show that the resulting meanings of many
derived items are not always semantically transparent. The introductory phonology section
outlines the pronunciation of native words and also introduces the user to the basics of Ilocano
phonology, including stress (vowel length), stress shift, morphophonemics, and syllabification.
Stress is shown with each root, but not with the derived forms unless it is idiosyncratic. Tagalog
equivalents are given for many of the entries, as are equivalents in many of the important
languages of Northern Luzon for a large number of basic words to aid comparativists.
        As this is the first edition of a root-based dictionary written without financial support for
adequate field editing or typing/research assistance, it fails to be as thorough as I would have
desired. I welcome all comments, criticism, and suggestions, and encourage the users to contact
me regarding the dictionary or any aspect of the Ilocano language they find interesting. It is my
hope that the dictionary can be improved and expanded one day in the future from the comments
of the users so as to be of greater value. I can be reached via electronic mail at
ilocano@philippines.to or through regular mail at the Department of Linguistics, University of
California, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA.
        Although the Ilocano language is spoken as a lingua franca of Northern Luzon and in
large communities outside the Philippines, it has no official status in the Philippines. No
particular body that I am aware of is presently working to modernize the language or create
materials for its instruction in the Philippines. It is my fervent hope that such a committee will
evolve to research the role of the Ilocano language in the twenty-first century and perhaps decide
how the language can effectively deal with the changing world into the third millennium. If such
a committee were to develop, I would be honored to be able to offer my time, research, and
suggestions to help propel its worthy cause.","[12, 13]"

linguistic traditions of naming them (actor, nonfocus subject, genitive). As enclitics, they have
the same morpho-syntactic properties as the =ak series pronouns. With verb phrases, they attach
to the first constituent.
        The =ko series paradigm is outlined below:             Independent                    =ko series                  English gloss             siak                           =ko, =k                     my
             sikâ                           =mo, =m                     your
             isu, isuna                     =na                         his, her

             dakami                         =mi                         our (exclusive)
             datayo                         =tayô                       our (inclusive)
             dakayo                         =yo                         your (plural); your (polite)
             isuda                          =da                         their        The first and second person singular pronouns have two forms =ko, =k\ and =mo, =m,
respectively. The forms =k and =m are used after vowels and fuse with the suffixes =en or -an
where the final -n of the suffix is lost, making these pronouns more like affixes than clitics:             balayko                        my house (f. balay 'house')
             pusam                          your cat (f. pusa 'cat')
             inumek                         I (will) drink something, (f. inumen 'to drink something')
             Intedko kenkuana.              I gave it to him.","[42, 43]"
"
6.3.5 Immediacy with apag-The prefix apag- is used to indicate immediate fulfillment of an action or state. When denoting
the English concept as soon as, the actor is encoded in the ergative case. With stative roots, it
may indicate a state not fully attained.       bângon           get up                apagbângon              just up (from bed)
       bift             moment                apagbiit                in just a moment
       sangpét          arrive                apagsangpétna           as soon as he arrives
       bingngi          open                  apagbingngi             slightly ajar
6.4 Causation (indirect action) and direction: the prefix pa-Ilocano verbs have corresponding causative (indirect) forms in which the action of the verb is
caused to be done, not directly done by the actor. The causative morpheme in Ilocano is pa- and
is used with the verbal affixes as exemplified in the following chart.",[70]
"        'I wrote the opera'. (Perfective form of surdten)        Aniä't kinnänmo?
        'What did you eat?' (Perfective form of kaneri)Directional   focusThe directional focus is formed with the suffix -an. It indicates that the absolutive argument is a
locative of some kind or some kind of partially affected patient. The suffix -an may also be used
with certain verbs to indicate addition or removal. It is used with many roots to indicate a human
patient in the case frame, i.e., takawen 'to steal something' vs. takawan 'to rob someone'. The
morphological cover term directional focus is reserved for the -an verb class, not because of the
semantic properties shared by all the members of the class, but due to certain semantic changes
that may indicate the direction or location of an action with a number of roots, i.e., sagaden 'to
sweep (dirt)' vs. sagadan 'to sweep (the floor)'.",[63]
"
Goal focus    distinctionsGoal focus verbs are classified by affix type on the basis of what semantic relationship the
argument in the absolutive case has with the verb.",[62]
"
6.2 Detransitivizing strategies for goal focus verbsAll goal focus (grammatically transitive) verbs in Ilocano can be changed into actor focus
(grammatically intransitive) verbs with detransitivizing affixes. This strategy is employed either
to form the antipassive, whereby an unindividuated patient (grammatical object) is put into the
oblique case and rendered indefinite, or it is used when the verb must be detransitivized as
required by the syntax, as in relative clause formation (see section 13.1). Note the differences
between the following sentences with transitive verbs and their detransitivized counterparts;          Kinnânko ti sabâ.              I ate the banana. (Transitive verb, core patient)
          Nangânak iti sabâ.             I ate bananas. (Intransitive verb, oblique patient)
          Ginatângna ti sida.            He bought the fish. (Transitive verb, core patient)
          Gimmâtang iti sida.            He bought fish. (Intransitive verb, oblique patient)          The following chart shows the particular affixes used to detransitivize a transitive verb:          Focus type                     Transitive                   Detransitive/*Intransitive          patient                        -en                         mang-

used for actions that are initiated and completed; the continuous aspect denotes continuous,
repetitive, or habitual actions; and the future aspect is used for actions that have yet to be
initiated. The unmarked infinitive form of the verb does not specify whether an action has been
initiated or completed.
         The perfective aspect is formed with a prefix (or infix) as shown below. The continuous
aspect is formed by initial CVC reduplication of the stem, 9 and the future is formed by the ad-
verbial clitic =to after consonants and =nto after vowels.",[66]
"2.3.1 Abstract nounsAbstract nouns may be formed with the prefix ka- (with roots expressing quantity or dimension)
or kina- (with stative roots). These substantives may be further elaborated with additional mor-
phology (morpheme boundaries shown with hyphens):       adu                                   much, a lot

between the prefix and root if the root noun is capitalized. In some Ilocano localities, this prefix
has the regional variant i-.        amianan         north             tagaamianan        person from the north

                            3. Articles and Demonstratives
3.1 ArticlesArticles in Ilocano encode number (singular and plural), two cases (core and oblique), and
differentiate personal nouns (names, vocatives, etc.) from non-personal nouns as shown in the
following paradigm:       Non-personal articles
                                        Core               Oblique
                        Singular        ti                 iti
                        Plural          dagití             kadagiti       Personal articles
                                        Core               Oblique
                        Singular        ni                 kenni (ken ni)
                        Plural          da                 kadá        The core and oblique distinction in Ilocano can be summarized in the following way.
Core nouns may be morphological arguments of verbs. They may be replaced by an enclitic
pronoun of either the =ko or =ak series. Oblique nouns, however, are not verbal arguments in
that they cannot be replaced by enclitic pronouns, although they may play an essential role in the
semantic frame of a verb.
        Grammatically intransitive verbs in Ilocano may take one enclitic pronoun in the =ak
series. When this particular argument appears as a full noun phrase, it takes core case marking:       nangán; nagsángit                       ate (intransitive); cried (intransitive)
       Nangának.                               late.
       Nangán ti babài.                        The girl ate.
       Nagsángitda.                            They cried.","[48, 49, 50, 51, 52]"
"         Ilocano transitive verbs and possessed nouns may express both the actor and patient (or
possessor/possessed) pronominally with enclitics. In this case, the =ko pronouns express the
agent (or possessor) and the =ak pronouns express the patient (or possessed entity). Some of the
forms have fused together and are now portmanteau enclitics that neutralize certain combinations,
i.e. -mo/-na + -ak = -nak, -yo/-da + ak = -dak, -na + -ka = -naka, -da/-kami + -ka- -daka, etc.4ACTOR i                               <r-          P A T I E N T

"                                                  1. Pronouns
Ilocano has five sets of pronouns: independent absolutives, independent possessives, enclitic
absolutives, enclitic ergative forms, and obliques. Pronouns in Ilocano encode person and
number. The first person plural pronouns differentiate inclusivity (including the addressee: I/we
+ you) and exclusivity (excluding the addressee: we, but not you). Second person pronouns
encode respect. Pronouns do not mark gender distinctions.",[41]
"2.2 Gender of nounsIlocano has no grammatical gender. However, many Spanish loanwords have been introduced
into the language that typically end in -a to indicate feminine gender: 7        doktór                                       male doctor
        doktóra                                      female doctor        emperador                                    emperor

        manang (Sp. hermana + -ng)                   older sister        Gender in nouns is sometimes expressed in Ilocano by separate lexical items:        amà & inà                                    father and mother
        bakét & l a k à y                            old woman and old man

        tàtang & nànang                              father and mother7
  Some words borrowed from colloquial Tagalog also indicate gender, -oy 'masculine' and -ay 'feminine'. These are
recently innovated forms that reflect Spanish influence: Pinoy 'male Filipino', Pinay 'female Filipino', Tisoy 'fair-
complexioned Filipino man', Tisay 'fair-complexioned Filipino woman'.
xlviii * Grammar Outline       In order to differentiate gender, the appositives a lalàki or a babài may be used to
designate masculinity or femininity respectively.       kabsàt a lalàki                       brother

lexeme in a nominal position (i.e., after an article or demonstrative) functions as a noun:       immay                                 came
       dagiti immay                          the ones who came       nasingpet                             well behaved, virtuous
       ti nasingpet                          the well-behaved person        Ilocano also has very productive derivational affixes that may nominalize a root that is
typically not substantival. I will list a few of the most common and useful of these prefixes here.","[47, 48]"

dicates. Postpredicate nominal slots are introduced b y determiners (articles or demonstratives).",[45]
"       Numbers are traditionally linked with ket, although the coordinator ken is used now by
most speakers for this purpose. Ket most often marks inversed predicates or resultative/reason
adverbial clauses.       sangapulo ket lima                        twenty-five
       duapulo ket inném                         twenty-six       Isüda ket nabangsit.                      They are smelly.

                                        11. Negation
Ilocano has two negative adverbs used to negate clauses or constituents: saan (dialectal variant:
haan) and di. With declarative sentences lacking enclitic pronouns, the negative counterparts are
formed by the negative adverb saan or di preceding the full declaration. With the adverb saan,
the declaration must be joined with the ligature (ng)a; no ligature is required with di. Saan is
preferred to di when negating noun phrases.",[79]
"
                                       5. Numbers
5.1 Cardinal numbersIlocano numbers follow a decimal system (of base ten). The cardinal numbers from one to nine
are: 1. maysa; 2. dua; 3. tallo; 4. uppat; 5. lima; 6. innem; 7. pito; 8. walo; 9. siam.
        Numbers over nine are formed by counting in terms of the following base-ten groups:       pulo                                  group of ten
       gasut                                 group of one hundred

       riwriw                                group of one million        Decimal groups are counted by the cardinal numbers from one to nine, separated by the
ligature (ng)a if the base number ends in a consonant. One group of a particular decimal number
is represented by the prefix sanga- attaching to the unit.       sangapülo                             ten (one group of ten)

    T h e paradigmatic discrepancies with the infix -um- allude to the possibility that the infix was not originally a voice
a f f i x , but an aspectual one. In m o d e r n Ilocano, it maintains its aspectual nature with s o m e roots, e.g., agtakder 'to
stand (durative)' vs. tumakder 'to stand up (punctual)'.

                             The Pre-Hispanic Syllabary
Before the arrival of the Spaniards in the sixteenth century, the Ilocanos employed a syllabary
resembling the Vedic scripts of India used in various other languages found throughout the
Philippines and Indonesia. It is similar to the scripts used by the Tagalogs and Pangasinenses,
although unlike these, the Ilocano script was innovated to designate coda consonants. In the
Tagalog script, readers were expected to supply the coda consonants from the context, as only
consonants in initial syllable position were written, with a diacritic representing the appropriate
vowel. Although this script is no longer in use in modern Ilocano, I show it below, taken from
the Ilocano Doctrina Cristiana of 1621.

                                     Affix Cross-Reference List
Successful word searching in a root-based dictionary of a morphologically complex language
such as Ilocano requires the ability to separate the root m o r p h e m e from the affixes. Native
speakers of Ilocano and trained linguists are usually able to do this quite easily in most cases, but
                                                                                                                                               Introduction * xvii
for students o f the language, this cross-reference list may prove most helpful. T h e affixes
alphabetized below are separated by category: prefixes, infixes, suffixes, and enclitics (which are
written in Ilocano orthography as suffixes). Users of the dictionary must also keep in mind that
many o f these affixes may be used with root reduplication of various types:

       The idiosyncrasies of the older Spanish-based system are eliminated in the modern
system as follows:
        The letters c and g used in the older Spanish spelling system no longer represent two
sounds. In the old system, c and g before a front vowel (;', e) represented [s] and [h] respectively.
In other environments, they represented [k] and [g], respectively:

13.3 Adverbial clausesAdverbial clauses are sentential or phrasal adjuncts. They provide modificatory information that
relates to their main clauses, and they are not required by the syntax of the language. Adverbial
clauses are formed with some type of adverb or overt subordinator that may be followed by a
variety of constituents ranging in form from simple nouns or nominalizations to independent
predicates (finite verbs). Among the various adverbial clause types are the following:Temporal
      Naluton idi sumangpet ti asawana.            It was already cooked when his wife arrived.
      Inaramidko sakbay ti panagawidda.            I did it before they went home.
lxxxiv * Grammar Outline         Nagpalpa pay, sa nagawid.                    He rested after eating first, then went home.
         Agsangit tunggal umayka.                     He cries whenever you come.","[83, 84]"
"
3.2.3 Future markerIlocano has a marker used to form temporal expressions with future time reference. The marker
usually appears in one of the four forms: intón, intono, tòno, or ton.        bigát           morning                         intono bigát           tomorrow
        rabil           night                           intono rabil           tonight
        malém           afternoon                       intono malém           in the afternoon                                               4. Adjectives
Adjectives 8 in Ilocano may be predicative or attributive. Many Ilocano adjectives are formed with
the prefix na-. This form is identical to the perfective aspect of the stative ma- verb:         laing          intelligence                    nalaing                intelligent
         alsem          sourness, acidity               naalsem                sour

         pigsa          strength                        napigsa                strong  The lexical class of adjectives differs formally from verbs since members of the class do not inflect for aspect and
do not assign focus. Adjectives, unlike verbs, may also follow the modifying adverb borrowed from Spanish medio
'somewhat' > medio natangken 'somewhat hard'.

productive) prefix a-:       ababa        short                         akaba             broad

three when the same adjectives are used with the prefix na-:       maingel       valiant (naingel: strong [liquor, tobacco]),
       masakit       sick (nasak.it: sore, aching)
       mauyong       crazy, insane (nauyong: cruel, mean)
       mabileg       strong, full grown, potent
       manakem       reasonable, logical, judicious
       masirib       wise, educated        Finally, a few adjectives are simple roots. Many adjectives in this class refer to physical
attributes or defects:Basic adjectives:       barò          new
       bassit        small
       dâan          old

Adjectives used to contrast nouns usually follow.       ti nasingpet nga ubing           the well-behaved child
       ti ubing a nasingpet             the well-behaved child (as opposed to the naughty ones)
       ti aso a nalaing                 the intelligent dogAdjectives indicating the composition or material of the qualified noun also follow:       ti tulbek a balitok              the gold key
       ti ruangan a bato                the stone door
       ti tugaw a landok                the iron chair4.2 Intensification and derivation of adjectivesThe quality of an adjective may be intensified by adding the prefix nag- and the enclitic =(e)n to
the root. This form is usually used to express wonder or admiration:       adu              much, a lot     nagadun             so many!
       napintas         beautiful       nagpintasen         how beautiful!

"3.2.1 Spatial demonstrativesIlocano demonstratives mark three degrees of spatial orientation: proximal, medial, and distal.
Proximal demonstratives mark nouns near the speaker, medial demonstratives mark nouns near
the addressee, or slightly far from both, while distal demonstratives are used to indicate the
distance of the noun to the speech event. The forms are given in the following paradigm:                                               Proximal         Mediai          Distal

and 'diay, respectively, which are used in Ilocano discourse like the articles. The full demon-
stratives may be connected to their nouns with the ligature (ng)a, while the abbreviated articles
may not:       Naglúto daydiáy (a) laláki.                       That boy cooked.
       Naglúto 'diáy laláki.                             The/That boy cooked.

one sound in the northern dialects. In the northern dialects (Ilocos Norte, Ilocos Sur), it corresponds
to a front, central lax vowel [e] similar to the e in pet.
        In the southern dialects, the letter 'e' represents two separate vowel sounds. In Spanish
loanwords, it is equivalent to the northern pronunciation. In native words, however, it is pronounced
as a high to high-mid, centralized back unrounded vowel [ui] that does not occur in word-final
position.","[27, 28]"

grammatical role of the co-referential argument in the main clause. That is, the co-referential
argument may function as either an ergative or an absolutive argument of the matrix predicate.","[82, 83]"

pronounced as a glottal stop [?] before consonants:          käka                     [ka:.k x a]                   elder sibling

voiceless alveolar fricative is pronounced like the s in soda. Like the stops, it may geminate:        malas                       [ma:.las]                     bad luck
        susay                       [su:.say]                     species of fish

palatalizes to [J]:        siempre                     [fern.pre]                    of course
        siak                        [fak]                         I

appears in borrowings from languages like Spanish, English, Chinese, or Tagalog. The only native
word with a glottal fricative is haan 'no', a spoken variant of saan.       haan                         [ha.?an]                      no

as a result of palatalization in certain phonological environments or in foreign language borrowings.
        The voiced alveo-palatal afficate [d3], like the English j in juice, is represented in the
orthography by dy or di + a vowel.        mandiak                     [man.d3ak]                    I don't
        dioga                       [d3o:.ga]                     breast, slang

        dios                        [d30s]                        god (f. Spanish)       The voiceless alveo-palatal affricate [tj~], like the English ch in China is represented in the
orthography by ts or ti + a vowel in borrowed words:        tsokolate                   [tjb.ko.la:.te]               chocolate (f. Spanish)
        atsara                      [?at.tja:.ra]                 pickles (f. Malay)
        itsura                      [?it.tjo:.ra]                 figure (f. Spanish)
        tianggi                     [tjaij.gi]                    store (f. Chinese)        In native words, the alveo-palatal affricate [tj~] results from the palatalization of t occurring
before the glide y or its equivalent (vowel i followed by another vowel).        tian                        [tjan]                        stomach

It does not have a velarized variant like the English '1' in syllable-final position.       lalláki                     [lal.lá:.ki]                  boys

it is often trilled like the Spanish rr of perro.        diário                     [d3á:.ryo]                    newspaper

1.5 The glidesIlocano has two glides, /w/ and lyl. For their use in diphthongal codas, see section 2.1.
       The labio-velar glide /w/ is formed with rounded lips and some obstruction at the velar part
of the mouth.        agbariwengwéng             [?ag.ba.ri.wuiq.wuíg]         whirl

        sílaw                      [sí:.law]                     light        The palatal glide lyl is pronounced like the y in yes. It is the consonantal counterpart of the
high front vowel i.        laya                        [la.ya]                      ginger

1.6 The nasalsIlocano has three nasal consonants, differentiated by the place of articulation in which the oral
airstream is blocked. The three nasals in Ilocano are /m/, /n/, and /ng/.
        The bilabial nasal /m/ is formed by closing the airstream at the lips. It is equivalent to the
English m in mother.        umáy                        [?u.máy]                     to come

touching the upper teeth or the alveolar ridge slightly behind the upper teeth. It is equivalent to the
Spanish n in no.

xlvi * Grammar Outline2.1 Plural of nounsNouns are usually pluralized simply by introducing them with the appropriate plural form of the
article or demonstrative. 6
         To emphasize plurality or distributiveness, however, nouns may be pluralized by CVC
(consonant-vowel-consonant) reduplication of the initial sound sequence of the root, e.g. sab-
sabong 'flowers (each individual flower; several flowers, different varieties of flowers; flowers
here and there)', balbalay 'houses', tugtugaw 'chairs', puspuso 'hearts', bakbakes 'monkeys'.
         Nouns beginning with vowels are articulated with an initial glottal stop, since no Ilocano
word may begin phonetically with a vowel. These nouns are pluralized by reduplicating the
initial glottal stop, vowel, and following consonant of the root. Ilocano orthography does not
represent the initial glottal stop; it is represented word-internally with a hyphen.        aso [?a:.so]                                  dog
        as-aso [?as.?a:.so]                           dogs        Nouns that begin with a CVV (consonant-vowel-vowel) sequence form their plural by
reduplicating the initial consonant and vowel of the root. The plural form thus begins with an
open syllable with a long vowel:        nuang                                         water buffalo
        nunuang [nu:.nuang]                           water buffalos       Many kin terms and proper nouns (nouns taking the article ni) form their plural simply by
reduplicating the initial CV (consonant-vowel) of the root, resulting in an open initial syllable.        baknang —> babaknang             rich               men
        dakkel —> dadakkel                             parents
        gayyem —> gagayyem                             friends
        ikit —> iikit [?i.?i:.kit]                     aunts
        ipag —> ifpag [?i.?i:.pag]                     sisters-in-law
        kaaruba —> kakaaruba                           neighbors
        kabsat —> kakabsat                             siblings
        kailian —> kakailian                           townmates
        kasinsin —» kakasinsin                         cousins
        kayong —> kakayong                             brothers-in-law
        komadre —> kokomadre                           komadres (see dictionary)
        masirib —> mamasirib                           wise men
        uliteg —> uuliteg [?u.?u.li.teg]               uncles
        siuman —> sisiuman                             stepchildren       The following terms denoting human referents form their plural simply by geminating
(doubling) the first consonant of the second syllable of the root:         adi —» addf                                   younger siblings
         ama —> amma                                   fathers
         anak —» annak                                 children
         apo —> appo                                   grandparents; grandchildren; gentlemen, etc.","[45, 46]"
"        There are three important interrogative particles in the language that are used as second
position enclitics of the verb phrase: kadi, ayä, and ngay. Kadi is used to form simple interro-
gatives and to soften commands, ayä is used to express wonder, surprise, or doubt in the interro-
gative, and ngay is used to verbally elicit response in any statement:       Sika ngay?                                   What about you?
       Nauyong aya?                                 Is he really cruel (seems surprising)?
       Sinno kadi?                                  Who is it?
       Napanglaw kadi?                              Is he poor?",[79]

                ACKNOWLEDGMENTS * PANAGYAMANSpecial thanks are due to four people who have reviewed the first manuscript of my dictionary and
have subsequently helped me with my linguistic research and travels in the Philippines every year
since. They are Mrs. Josefa Mallare Galvez, Dra. Geraldine Galvez, Mrs. Maria Roldan, and Mrs.
Elizabeth Tadina of San Fernando, La Union. I would also like to thank my parents, Florence
Konvalinka, Carmen, Edwin, Benedict, and Carol Villanueva, Melissa Deleissegues, and Alex
Gonzales for their support and encouragement in all my work. Thanks to the faculty and graduate
students of the Department of Linguistics at the University of California-Santa Barbara for all the
wonderful times and to the Linguistics faculty and graduate students of the Australian National
University. I also greatly appreciate the efforts of the Sanglay Law Office in San Fernando, La
Union, Galvez Clinic, Cristy Boija, DZNL radio, Liw Agbayani, APGSA Santa Barbara, and the
Superior Court of Laoag for accommodating my research with such warm hospitality. Atty. Aurora
Sanglay and Dr. Imelda Quilala graciously supplied me with Bannawag magazines for which I am
most grateful. I must also express my deep gratitude to some Ilocano writers and pressmen for their
gracious help with my inquiries: Roy V. Aragon, Dr. Godofredo Reyes, Ramon Pagatpatan,
Prescillano Bermudez, Lorenzo Tabin, Elnora Manangan, Severino A. Pablo, Pelagio Alcantara,
Ethelwaldo Madamba, D. Nicasio Asuncion, and Redentor Santos. They are, of course, not
responsible for any shortcomings in the manuscript. In preparing this dictionary, I have read the
works of hundreds of Ilocano writers from different regions in order to collect the sample of words
in this present volume. I cannot thank them all personally, but I wish them continued success in
propagating the beauty of the Ilocano language through literature. Maraming salamat to Kenneth
Chang and Nick Kibre for their computer help. I am also very grateful to all the linguists who have
commented on my work in linguistics, especially to my mentor Marianne Mithun, Laurie Reid,
Nikolaus Himmelman, Andy and Medina Pawley, Wallace Chafe, Steven Fincke, Susanna
Cumming, Sandra Thompson, Byron Bender, Bob Dixon, Sasha Aikhenvald, Geoff Haig, Alec
Coupe, Agnes Kang, Tony Davis, Peter Fitzgerald, and to the Ilokano department in Hawai'i: Josie
Paz Clausen and Precy Espiritu. I would like to thank Mrs. Hilda Manansala for allowing me to use
the Market scene painting on the cover of this book. Maria Victoria Herrera was extremely helpful
in contacting the members of the Philippine art community for me. In closing, I would like to give
special thanks to my family in America and the Philippines (the Rubinos, Galvezes, Villanuevas,
Konvalinkas, Carbonells, and Lita Aquino) and to Maria Gracia Tan Llenado for their untiring
support and understanding of my work in lexicography and linguistics.

Luzon, Philippines. It is the most widely spoken Philippine Cordilleran language, and constitutes
its own branch within the Cordilleran language family as indicated in the following genetic
reconstruction by Lawrence Reid (1989:57):
