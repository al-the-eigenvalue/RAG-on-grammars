                 Introduction
                 Language          name        and present         setting
                 Manarayi is the name of an Aboriginal Australian language indigenous to
                 the western Roper River in the Northern Territory.      In the Roper River area,
                 a single name is frequently used both to refer to a language and to members
                 of the social group characterized    (at least in part) by speaking that lan-
                 guage.   Thus along the Roper people use ""Manarayi' as a language name and a
                 designation of social identity.    The name is linguistically unanalyzable

one of a number of semantically fairly empty separable auxiliaries which                     Exp. = experiential
serve as prop for inflectional affixes, e.g., buy? wu- 'to show'.      Second,               F. = feminine noun class
‘compound’ verbs consist of an initial (usually unanalyzable)     compounding                Foc. = focus clitic
element followed by an inseparable auxiliary.    The inseparable auxiliaries                 Gen. = genitive
are a subset of the separable ones of particle plus auxiliary constructions.                 Hab. = habitual
An example of the compound type is barafitbu- 'to dream'.    Finally, there                  Hort. = hortative
are morphologically simple verb roots which can function by themselves with                  Imp. = imperative

Cross-referencing pronominal prefixes are obligatory in the verb.    There
are two sets of cross-referencing pronominals, subjective and objective.                     IS. = intransitive subject

constructions.   These can only be expressed outside the verb by appropriate                 N. = neuter noun class
case forms of pronouns, demonstratives or nouns.                                             N. = noun (in phrase structure diagrams)

The prefixes used to express subordination are identical to those used to                     Neg. = negative
mark irrealis mood (a category used to express uncertainty and possibility,                   Nom. = nominative
but not negation).   The major, weakly subordinated clause type can be                        Nom. = nominalizer

verbs which augment their stems, augment a only is added in the past neg-                                                             particle.   As usual in causativization,    the subject of the intransitive
ative, and usually also in habitual forms only augment a is added, but a                                                              construction (IS) becomes   the direct object (TO) of the causative construc-
few verbs have both augments in the habitual.      The majority of verbs have                                                         tion.   Intransitive/causative pairs with causative-forming jud+ma- are:
only augment b in the habitual.     The non-past suffix category occurs in the                                                                                       bal?       ni-                    ""to    sit'

However, this final suffix contributes quite different meanings depending                                                                                            jad       jud+ma-                 ""to    put            back,     make     return'

verb particles are used both with and without the final syllable, as gal?                                                                                             ‘to    slip'                                                         ‘to    list, call          out'

Major    stress    falls     on the vowel        of monosyllabic               roots,     on    the     first     vowel
of    bisyllabic    roots;     and   the   root       penult     of    trisyllabic         simple        roots:                 4.1.     Ideophones

       However, those verbs with stem-augment -na- have the augment in past
negative forms also, always followed by past negative suffixal allomorph
                                                                            -m.
To create past counterfactual verb forms meaning ‘wanted to, should have,
would have' the past negative is further suffixed with desiderative-inten-
tional-allomorph -gu following nasals.    In such forms, major stress falls
on the stem-augment -na-, conforming to the proposed ideal penultimate
stress pattern on inflected verb forms:
         na-day~né-m=gu               ""I wanted         to bite        it'
       The reflexive-reciprocal morpheme has several forms; one is mono-
syllabic -y(i)-, and two are bisyllabic, -Jiy(i)- and -fjiy(i)-.   Though
the monosyllabic suffix may constitute the penultimate syllable of an
inflected verb, it does not receive stress.   The monosyllabic form of the
reflexive-reciprocal morpheme occurs only with a handful of CV, CVC and one
CVCV root; major stress falls on the only or final root vowel:
         Ja-wula-bd-yi-n              ""they     pl. are    hitting           each    other'
       wo la-bd-yi-ni               ""they pl.were hitting each other' PC
       Ja-wula-jd-yi-n              ""they are swearing at each other'
       wo la-jd-yi-ni               ""they pl. swore at each other' PC
A stress falls on the          first syllable of bisyllabic reflexive-reciprocal
forms:
        ja-wula-nanityu-jfyi-n                ‘they pl.are            talking       to each other’
        wula-nanityu-jiyi-ni                  ""they    pl. spoke        to    each     other'     PC

to     kinsmen of certain types.   A frequent circumstance in which they would
be     used is when some third person is swearing at, or also joking with, a
person     who    stands    in a certain        relation       to an       ‘audience’.            The     ‘audience’,
observing what is going on, utters the appropriate exclamation.   The
Manarayi  conceive of this as an attempt (whether in earnest or in jest)                                                 to
stop the person who is swearing, joking or otherwise disturbing the

       There are two noun stems which occur only as bound forms, either
with a determiner such as a possessive suffix or within a complex nominal
construction of some kind.     One is -mi- 'vegetable food' which occurs, for
example, in the predicate nominal construction
       na-mi-wi
       1Sg-vegetable food-Priv
          'I have no vegetable food'.
It has the same meaning as the free form mawuj, which may also occur in
the predicate nominal construction.     The second noun stem is -da- 'meat,
flesh'       which     was      always           found       to     occur       with        a    possessive            suffix,        e.g.

Until quite recently, work on theoretical linguistics and work on language description
proceeded   almost     entirely    in isolation   from   one   another.    Work        on    theoretical    ‘
linguistics, especially in syntax, concentrated primarily on English, and its results                       i
were felt to be inapplicable to those interested in describing other languages. Work                        \
on describing individual languages was almost deliberately isolationist, with the
development    of    a different     framework    and    terminology      for   each        language   or
language group, and no feeding of the achievements of language description into
linguistic theory. Within the last few years, however, a major rapprochement has
taken place between theoretical and descriptive linguistics. In particular, the rise of
language typology and the study of language universals have produced a large
number of theoreticians who require accurate, well-formulated descriptive data from
a wide range of languages, and have shown descriptive linguists that they can both
derive benefit from and contribute to the development of linguistic theory. Even
within generative syntax, long the bastion of linguistic anglocentrism, there is an                                FRANCESCA MERLAN
increased interest in the relation between syntactic theory and a wide range of
language types.
   For a really fruitful interaction between theoretical and descriptive linguistics, it is
essential that descriptions of different languages should be comparable. The
Questionnaire of the present series (originally published as Lingua, vol. 42 (1977),
No. 1) provides a framework for the description of a language that is (a) sufficiently
comprehensive to cover the major structures of any language that are likely to be of
theoretical interest; (b) sufficiently explicit to make cross-language comparisons a
feasible undertaking (in particular, through the detailed numbering key); and (c)
sufficiently flexible to encompass the range of variety that is found in human
language. The volumes that were published in the predecessor to the present series,
the Lingua Descriptive Studies (now available from Routledge), succeeded in
bridging the gap between theory and description: authors include both theoreticians
who are also interested in description (e.g. Peter Cole on Imbabura Quechua) and
field-workers with an interest in theory (e.g. John Davies on Kobon).
   The aim of the Croom Helm Descriptive Grammars is thus to provide descriptions
of a wide range of languages according to the format set out in the Questionnaire.
Each language will be covered in a single volume. The first priority of the series is
grammars of languages for which detailed descriptions are not at present available
(thus, the monographs on Nkore-Kiga and Babungo are the first comprehensive
descriptions of those languages). However, the series will also encompass
descriptions of better-known languages with the series framework providing more
detailed descriptions of such languages than are currently available (as with the
monographs on West Greenlandic and Kannada).",[1]
