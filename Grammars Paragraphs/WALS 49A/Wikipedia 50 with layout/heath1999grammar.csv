"      Since ci links a subject NP with a postverbal NP, it resembles a transitive verb.
In many languages, an equational sentence with copula would be distinguished from a
transitive by case marking (copular 'X-Nominative be Y-Nominative' versus transitive
'X-Nominative hit Y-Accusative'), but KCh has no overt case marking for the
postverbal NPs in either case. If a third person pronoun functions as predicate NP after
ci, it takes the form 3Sg ga or 3P1 gi, just like direct object pronouns, as in (223), a
particularly common phrase.(223)         nda   a          na          ci        ga, ...
              if    3SgS Neg               be        3SgO, ...
              Otherwise, ...' (lit. 'if it isn't it, ...')     ci is clearly a verb syntactically, but behaves differently from ordinary verbs with
reference to MAN marking. Ordinary verbs freely allow the full set of preceding MAN
possibilities (§7.2): zero (interpreted as perfective indicative positive), Neg na, Impf o
-go, ImpfNeg si, Subju ma, and Subju + Neg ma si. By contrast, ci combines easily
only with zero and with Neg na. For ci, these aspectually unmarked forms are used
indiscriminately for both present and past time reference. The other MAN
possibilities, while attested, are uncommon in texts. Attempts to elicit imperfective
forms in future contexts ('I'm chief this year, and next year I'll still be chief) yield
constructions with inchoative kaa 'become' or continuative cindi 'remain' rather than
Stative ci. However, there are occasional occurrences of Impf o - go with Si in the
texts, indicating that the Impf marker is at least grammatical with ci. Examples in
(224).

3.7.8 Deletion of word-initial vowels (apheresis)Except for French loans and a few grammatical morphemes such as personal pronouns,
words do not normally begin with vowels. The two chief exceptions are Arabic loans
beginning in a, and certain nouns and adjectives beginning in /'. Many of the Arabic
loans probably entered KCh from other African languages (cf. §3.10.8), which
probably accounts for the variation in their form.
     Arabic has a definite prefix al-, which undergoes a special assimilation to a
following coronal consonant (affricate j is treated in Classical Arabic as noncoronal,
but in most modern Maghrebi dialects as coronal). As with Arabic loans into European
languages (algebra, algorithm), Arabic nouns borrowed into KCh often include the old
definite prefix, though the prefix is no longer segmentable and no longer marks
defmiteness. This gives rise to the KCh surface patterns in (43), where T is a coronal
consonant and K is a noncoronal (velar, labial) consonant:(43)       Four onset types of nouns borrowed from Arabic
           a. alKV... , as in albacir 'miser';
           b. a/V... after loss of glottal stop or pharyngeal, as in alaahidu 'promise';
           c. IV... , as in (b), with further elision of the initial *a, as in ladab 'polite
                 person';
           d. aTTV... , as in adduhaa 'mid-morning'.",[53]
"    Each of (6-8) begins with a subject NP, which in (7-8) is a personal pronoun. The
MAN position is occupied by Impf o in (6), by zero in (7), and by Neg na in (8).
Except with equational and locational quasi-verbs, a zero MAN position is interpreted
as perfective positive, which is extremely common in past tense narrative. The verb
stem, here guna 'see', has no inflectional affixes for either pronominal agreement or
MAN categories. The direct object NP follows the verb (though not always
immediately), whether it is a pronoun as in (7) or a full NP as in (6,8). Further
constituents such as adverbial modifiers generally follow the direct object NP, as with
doodi 'there' in (6-7) and the Locative PP in (8). However, when a verb is followed by
two or more complements (NPs and PPs), their linear ordering reflects morphological
and discourse considerations as well as pure syntax.
    The maximal internal structure of a NP or PP is schematized in (9).(9)            possessor - noun - adjective - numeral - demonstrative - Definite -
                    Plural - DF[discourse-function] - postposition      Examples of this structure are (10-12).

                 person black       two     Def
                'the two black persons'     In (9), the noun slot is essentially obligatory except that an understood noun may
be omitted after a possessive (as in the pattern: 'Which house? Mine, or my
father's?'). Possessor, adjective, and numeral are optional. In the defmiteness slot, the
choices are Def di and zero. In the plurality slot, the choices are PI yo and zero
(usually interpreted as singular). The DF slot may be filled by a topic, emphatic, or
similar morpheme. In the final position, there are several nonzero postpositions such
as Dative se and Locative kuna. Subject and direct object NPs have zero case, and may
be said informally to be in the Nominative. Some adverbial modifiers like nee 'here'
can be analysed as zero case forms of (defective) nouns.
     Personal pronouns can, of course, be used as NPs, but they do not fit neatly into
the schema (9). For example, the (third person) logophoric plural pronoun has a
discernible (but often phonologically altered) PI ending yo, as in (13). Any pronoun
can take a DF morpheme, a postposition, or both (14).(13)           qgi-yo          (pronounced [rjgijo], [rjgije], [nge:], etc.)

               'to (for) me'     The more complex sentence structures that we will briefly introduce here are topic
and focus constructions, relative clauses, and complement clauses (reported speech,
subjunctive, serial verbs).
     Topic constituents (usually NPs) are usually preposed and set off from the
sentence proper by a pause. In this preposed position, they optionally take a Topic
morpheme. One common Topic morpheme is bine (also a noun 'heart'), often in
contrastive-topic function. A preposed topical NP often corresponds to a pronoun (in
any syntactic function or position) in the sentence proper, as in (15).(15)             [[ay      baaba]       bine],       ay          guna      ga

                                   Introduction
1.1 Generalities about SonghaySonghay is often described loosely as a ""language,"" but in fact it is a large complex of
varieties, some of which are quite clearly distinct languages. Languages of the
Songhay family are linguistically dominant in northeastern Mali along the Niger
River, and others of the family occupy much of the Republic of Niger (""Kaado"" and
""Zarma""). Additional varieties are spoken in Bonin, and perhaps still residually in the
Dori area of Burkina Faso (formerly Upper Volta). Some ""nomadic"" or ""northern""
Songhay languages, not yet well studied, are spoken by small beduin groups in far
northern Niger, with one offshoot each extending into Mali ('Tadaksahak"" near
Menaka) and in southwestern Algeria (""Korandje"" in the Tabelbala oasis). The major
work on the internal genetic classification of Songhay varieties is that of Nicola'i
(1981), who puts considerable emphasis on sound changes and phonological typology.
     My work on Songhay has focused to date on the four main varieties spoken in
Mali. The following sets of designations are partially interchangeable. One set
consists of transcriptions of the native terms; the second is simply the name (in
English or French) of the respective major town; the third is the cardinal-direction
system developed by Nicola'i.        native term         major city or town    NicolaTs term

         koroboro senn-i    Gao                   eastern Songhay (S. oriental)
         humburi senn-i     Hombori               central Songhay (S. central)     For Gao, koroboro senn-i co-occurs with other variants such as koyra senn-i and
koyra senn-e.
     The nouns ciini and senn-i ~ senn-i (with variant senn-e ~ senn-e) are noncognate,
though both mean 'speech, speaking, language', cf. verbs cii (<*ciin) and selaq -
seien. In the cases of Djenne and Hombori, both of which are (in effect) Songhay
enclaves rather than parts of extended Songhay-speaking regions, the first term of the
compound is simply the name of the town. Timbuktu and Gao, on the other hand, are
merely the largest cities in extended Songhay-speaking regions, and the terms for these
varieties are more general: koyra-ciini 'town language' and koroboro-senn-i
(contraction of koyra-boro senn-i 'town-person language') distinguish the sedentary
Songhays from the nomadic Arabs and Tuaregs. The Songhay are also sometimes
called 'river people' (Timbuktu isa-boro), but no related expression for their language
is in common use.
     For the native sense of sonoy, see beginning of §1.2.
     We will use the informal transcription ""Koyra Chiini"" to denote the unbroken
koyra ciini complex of dialects in the region along and near the Niger River beginning
2   1 Introduction with Timbuktu. This includes the towns of Dire"", Tonka, Goundam, and Niafunke
 going upriver (west) from Timbuktu. There is a thinly populated northern extension in
 Araouane, on the caravan route from Timbuktu to Taoudenni. There is a relatively
 sharp linguistic break between Koyra Chiini and Koroboro Senni (the ""Gao"" variety)
just east of Timbuktu. Koroboro Senni is the traditional language even of Gourma
 Rharous and Bamba, the first important towns on the Niger River going east from
Timbuktu.
      Most of my Koyra Chiini data are from Timbuktu itself. I have a corpus of some
 six hours of transcribed recordings, mostly dyadic (interviews, conversations, or
 narratives with an interactive listener). I have supplemented this data base with elicited
material obtained chiefly in the final field sessions (1996-97).
      I also have some transcribed recordings from Niafunke"" and Goundam, which can
 serve as representatives of the larger complex of ""upriver"" dialects (""upriver"" from the
perspective of Timbuktu). I also spent about a week in this area in 1996 to clear up
 some problems in the analysis of these tapes and to do some follow-up elicitation and
ethnobiological vocabulary elicitation and specimen collection. A summary of
observable differences between the upriver dialects and the Timbuktu dialect is given in
the short Appendix 1. In the much larger Appendix 2, I describe the distinctive and
 geographically separated variety of Djenno, which I refer to as ""Djenne Chiini"" (for
jenne ciini, literally ""Djenn6 language""). Abbreviations for the Malian Songhay
 languages and varieties used in this grammar are KCh (Koyra Chiini, the present
object of study), DjCh (Djenne Chiini), KS (Koroboro Senni of Gao, etc.), and HS
 (Humburi Senni of Hombori). Names of other Songhay languages are not abbreviated.
      The wider genetic affiliation of Songhay is controversial. It is one of the few
African languages for which Joseph Greenberg (1966) did not make a confident
assignment to a large genetic stock, though he suggested Nilo-Saharan as a possible
connection. Nicolai (1984, 1990) has suggested a possible Creole origin in which
Tamashek (Tuareg) played a major lexifying role, but this has not won wide
acceptance. It might be advisable to defer reconsideration of the wider affiliation of the
 Songhay complex until we have better descriptions of the several varieties within the
complex and can thus do serious reconstruction of Proto-Songhay.","[4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18]"
"
1.3 Format of grammarThe present grammar of KCh is written in a fairly strict format to facilitate
comparison to the appendices and to my forthcoming parallel descriptions of other
Songhay languages. The numbering of chapters and sections thereof will be held
constant to the extent possible, although this means that in each grammar some
subsections are blank (e.g., ""tonology"" in the present grammar). In Appendix 1 on the
""upriver"" (Goundarm, Niafunke) varieties, and to a lesser extent in Appendix 2 on
DjCh, we disregard areas where their grammars do not differ significantly from that of
Timbuktu KCh (perhaps giving an example or two), reserving extended analysis for
areas where they differ from Timbuktu.
     The format of the grammar is not revolutionary, and its general nature can be
gleaned from a pass through the table of contents. We begin with a brief overview
chapter (2), designed to give readers an idea what a simple Songhay sentence looks
like. Fortunately, the language is simple morphologically and readers should be able to
pick up its basic sentence structure quickly. A brief chapter on phonology (3) leads to
two chapters (4, 5) on nominal constructions, the first focusing on derivational
processes (also including information on personal and demonstrative pronouns), the
second describing NP inflection and phrasal syntax.
     Verbs likewise get two chapters (6, 7), one mainly on voice categories expressed
by suffixation (or by zero), the other on mood-aspect-negation (MAN) inflection and
VP structure.
     The next chapter (8) turns to ""information packaging"" issues such as focus, topic,
and relativization. These are all of great importance in Songhay discourse, and it turns
out that there are important differences among the Songhay varieties in the respective
forms and functions. This is followed by a chapter (9) on complex (interclausal)
syntax, in which various types of ""serial verb"" construction play important roles. The
final grammatical chapter (10) is on anaphora; the most significant topic here is the
use of logophoric and reflexive versus ordinary personal pronouns.
     The last chapter (11) looks at selected lexical semantic matters, including the
lexical division of labor in expressing spatiotemporal concepts, and some
ethnosemantic issues such as kinship and emotion terminology.
     A volume of Texts in Koyra Chiini (Songhay of Timbuktu) is in press with
Koppe Verlag, Cologne. It includes texts from Timbuktu, Niafunke (an ""upriver""
dialect), and Djenne. A set of three Songhay-English-French dictionaries is to be
published by rHarmattan, Paris. One of the three is KCh (Timbuktu to Niafunke), and
another is for DjCh (the third is KS of Gao).
6     1 Introductionl .4 Transcriptional conventionsKCh is quite simple morphologically and there are few productive phonological rules
disguising underlying (lexical) phonological representations. Double slashes // ... //
enclose underlying representations (not italicized). In the grammar text, brackets [ ... ]
enclose phonetic representations. The ordinary phonemic transcription is italicized
without slashes or brackets. We use the hyphen ""-"" as a morpheme boundary in a fairly
restricted set of cases where it seems justified. Examples are verb stems containing a
derivational suffix (Fact-Caus or Mediop -ndi), such as dira-ndi 'cause to walk'.
     It has been difficult to decide whether to use hyphens in noun-noun compounds,
noun-adjective combinations, and similar close-knit stem sequences showing various
degrees of lexicalization. There is no consistent phonological test for lexicalization of
such combinations, and other criteria (frequency, semantic specialization) are gradient
rather than categorical. In general, I use hyphens in compounds sparingly (when the
combination seems fairly clearly lexicalized), and in combinations involving high-
frequency finals such as -ije 'child' and -fiaa 'mother'. However, readers should not put
too much stock in these transcriptional decisions.
     My most idiosyncratic transcriptional decision is to use the subscripted ligature
""^"" to indicate assimilations across word or morpheme boundaries. This enables us to
show the basic forms of the morphemes in question, maintaining the transparency of
the morpheme structure, while at the same time at least hinting at the surface
pronunciation.
     In the case of nasal consonants, a ligature indicates point-of-articulation
assimilation to a following segment, generally n —> [η] before velar stop. The
expected parallel shifty—> [n] before alveolar consonant is moot in Timbuktu KCh,
where lexical stem-final η is normally absent, but occurs in upriver KCh dialects
which allow stem-final η.","[21, 22]"
"
3.9.2 Stress, incorporation (tight compounding), and cliticizationStress is nonphonemic, with neither lexical nor grammatical significance, in the
analysis and transcription used here. In a few cases, an unusual phonetic stress
                                             3.10 Historical phonological notes     49placement may be a surface indicator of vowel length in a position (before a consonant
cluster) where duration is an unreliable surface cue; see §3.7.9.
     As in many languages, multisyllabic words tend to have reduced phonetic stress
(intensity, pitch, vocalic duration, etc.) on final syllables, especially CV syllables.
Even stem-final CVV syllables in nonmonosyllabic words tend to be heard as
unstressed short-voweled phonetic [CV] when prepausal or at the end of syntactic
phrases, so the length of final vowels is best determined by adding a grammatical
formative, e.g. Def di in the case of nouns. The lack of intrinsic stress on final
syllables allows speakers to use final syllables to express higher-level intonational
patterns (e.g. rising pitch marking interrogation or a desire to keep the floor).
     Many grammatical morphemes, though transcribed as separate words, are regularly
unstressed and tend to pattern as proclitics or enclitics to nouns, verbs, and other
lexical stems. We do not emphasize this issue here since the phonological
consequences are usually nonexistent or subtle. For that matter, there are no
completely reliable phonetic indices of affixation or incorporation (tight compounding,
§4.6), as opposed to word sequencing, and our decisions about which morpheme
sequences to recognize as single-word compounds and which to separate
transcriptionally are based largely on semantic lexicalization and morphosyntactic
patterning.
     The best case for cliticization as a formal feature of the grammar involves
postverbal pronominal objects and pronominal PPs. These elements normally
immediately follow the verb, preceding other postverbal constituents that involve full
(noun-headed) NPs (§9.1.1). The dative forms of two pronouns, ISg and 2Sg, also
show special forms in this postverbal position, as opposed to the regular forms they
have in fronted (focalized, preverbal) position (§3.8.1-2).","[64, 65]"
"
5.2.3 Possessors as apparent heads of the higher NPIn the English sentence My dog ran away but John's is still here, the possessor John's
appears to function as head of the higher NP and denotes John's dog. Alternatively, we
could say that the head noun is expressed by zero (John's 0 is...).
     The same pattern occurs in KCh. In this case, the postposition wane is
obligatory. In the ordinary definite case, wane is directly followed by Def di, a
combination which is irregularly realized as wan di (§3.8.4). Examples in (98), with
the position of the unexpressed head noun marked by 0.(98)     a. [ay       wan]        0      di  yo
            [ISg      Poss]       0      Def PI
            'mine(Pl)'
         b. [bar       di         yo     wan]     0     di  se
            [man       Def        PI     Poss]    0     Def Dat
            'for the men's'     It is possible, but fairly unusual, to get wane in indefinite contexts without Def
di, as in (99).(99)          yer fari hay kul kaa ci [[moo ta                 wane]      0]
              1P1S grow thing all Rel be [[rice Top Poss]                 0]
              'We have planted everything which is (any kind) of rice.'",[102]
"
3.10.11 Loanword phonologyArabic loanwords are tricky since they may come either from Classical Arabic
(Timbuktu has long been a center for Islamic learning and most KCh speakers are
Muslim), or from the local Hassaniya vernacular. Moreover, as noted in §3.7.8, many
Arabic loans are regional terms found in many other West African languages such as
Fulfulde and Bambara, and the provenience of individual borrowings may be indirect.
Of particular interest are Arabic loans filtered through Tamashek (Tuareg), since this
language makes a number of neutralizations in Arabic back consonants.
     Arabic consonants like Λ (voiceless pharyngeal fricative), f (voiced pharyngeal
approximant), χ (voiceless uvular fricative), and r (voiced uvular fricative), are
occasionally heard in loanwords in the religious domain, as spoken by certain
Timbuktu speakers who have some knowledge of Arabic. However, none of these
segments is well-established in KCh. The conversions in (52) are attested:(52)     Arabic consonantal conversions
                                    Arabic           KCh           gloss
         Ar. h —> KCh h             ad-duhaa         adduhaa       'mid-morning'
         Ar. f—> KCh zero           al-'arbafaa'     allarbaa      'Wednesday'
         Ar. χ —> KCh h or k        al- 'aaxir-a     alaakara      '(the) Hereafter'
                                    al-xabar         alhabar       'news'
         Ar. Y —> KCh Y             al-bulr-a        albaiga       'slippers'     There are isolated cases of deletion of one of the three Arabic consonants other
than f. It is likely that the k output from Ar. x is characteristic of indirect loans (via
Fulfulde?). There are a few cases of KCh £ for an Arabic back consonant, probably
secondarily palatalized from earlier *k (again via Fulfulde?). Examples are albacir
'miser' (Ar. root Vox/) and perhaps baalioi 'adult man' (if from Ar. root VWr 'attain'
with unexplained devoicing).
     French borrowings are likewise of variable provenience, sometimes entering
directly and sometimes coming in via Bambara, Fulfulde, and other local languages.
Newly borrowed verbs are generally taken over with final ee, representing the set of
forms -er, -ez, -ait, etc., hence kaaree 'cut into squares' from Fr. correr. Vowel-final
nouns are also often borrowed with a long vowel: kafee 'coffee'. The tendency to
stress and lengthen the final French syllable is also apparent in borrowings from
French consonant-final nouns, where we typically get a lengthened vowel and an extra
final high vowel, as in sigireeti 'cigarette' and almeetu 'matches' (Fr. cigarette,
allumettes).
                            Chapter 4
              Nouns, pronouns, and nominal derivation
4.1 Personal pronouns
Personal pronouns can occupy the same kinds of syntactic positions as the lexical cores
of ""full"" NPs. That is, a personal pronoun corresponds syntactically to an NP structure
consisting maximally of a possessor, a head noun, an adjective, a numeral, a
demonstrative, Def di, and PI yo (§5.A).","[70, 71]"
"
5.4.5 Complementary subsets ('some ... , others ...')Another important logical relationship is generated by the partition of a set X of
entities into two or more subsets (X,, X2,...). In discourse, antithetical predications are
commonly made of the subsets, usually two in number but occasionally more. The
role of quantifiers in such sequences can be examined by considering this scenario: 'The
outlaws were holed up in a canyon. Some! gave themselves up immediately, somcj
fought for a while then gave up, and some3 fought to the bitter end.' In English, this
may be conveyed by any of the patterns in (115a-e), among others.(115)                                              symmetrical?   exclusive? open?
         a.   somej ... , some2 ... ,, some3 ...          V          no         V
         b.   some] ... , others^ ... , others3 ...       no         V          V
         c.   some] ... , some2 ... , the others 3 ... no            partly     no
         d.   some] ... , others2 ... , the other s 3 ... no         V          no
         e.   some] ... , others2 ... , still others3 ... no         V          V
      Any combination of some and others involves at least some explicit exclusivity
(the subsets do not overlap). With symmetrical some (115a), the quantifiers do not
literally require exclusivity, though in the outlaw scenario described one can deduce
exclusivity from the contrary relations among the predicates, and in any event
exclusivity is often inferred from symmetrical parallel constructions like (115a) by
implicature. The patterns (115a-b,e) could potentially continue with additional (fourth,
fifth, ...) parallel segments, while (15c-d) are brought to a screeching halt by the
others, which forces closure.
     In KCh, the typical pattern for antithetical parallelism is semantically distinct
from all of these English patterns. What we usually get is the type ftndi yo ... , cindi
yo ... , oindi yo ..., literally 'remainder PI ... , remainder PI ... , remainder ΡΓ (i.e.,
Others ... , others ... , others ...'). This symmetrical pattern resembles the English
type (115a), except that it is entirely exclusive insofar as each segment (even the first)
anticipatorily opposes its subset to the subsets expressed in the following segments.
(Latin likewise has alii... , alii... Others ... , others ...'.) Other variants of the same
general type are jere foo ... ,jere foo ... One part... , one part ...' and a-foo yo ... ,
a-foo yo... '(some) ones ... , (some) ones ...' In the latter type it is also possible to
addDef di, giving a-foo di yo..., a-foo di yo ... 'the ones ..., the ones ...'
     When the complementary subsets each consist of an individual, the typical
construction is indefinite a-foo..., a-foo ... One ... , one ...' or definite a-foo di... ,
a-foo di... 'the one ... , the one ...'
94      5 Nominal inflection and NP syntax5.4.6 Generalized quantifiers ('many, much, few')Quantificational adjectives are, formally, special cases of ordinary adjectives of the sort
discussed in §4.4.1-3. Specifically, as modifiers they follow the head noun (and any
descriptive adjectives), and when they function as heads of NPs they take an Absol
prefix. However, they differ from ordinary adjectives in some respects. The basic
generalized quantifiers are 'many, much' and 'little, few'. Each is used with both mass
and count nouns.
     For 'many, much' the intransitive verb is bow 'be abundant, numerous'. The
modifying adjective corresponding to tow is bobo 'much, many'. On these forms, see
§3.10.1. The Absol form is i-bobo. Following the pattern observed with numerals,
even when added to countable nouns bobo is not directly followed by PI yo (116b), but
yo is added if there is an intervening Def di (116c).(116)      a. jiiroo          duijguri       si            bow
              year-this       beans          ImpfNeg       be-abundant

              'hex and shey'     Logophoric pronouns fit somewhat variably into the hierarchy (157), reflecting the
fact that a (third person) logophoric pronoun in reported speech represents a first person
pronoun in the original speech event (Ί am coming' becoming reported-speech 'Hex
said he, (LogoSg) was coming'). See end of §10.1.2 for examples and discussion.
     Some subdialects of KS express Ί, and hey' as 'we,y and hey' and so forth, the left
conjunct being pluralized to subsume the denotation of the two conjuncts. This
114     5 Nominal inflection and N P syntaxconstruction does not occur, to my knowledge, in KCh, and combinations like (158a)
with singular left conjunct are normal.
     From (158c-d) we can see that the right conjuncts take the same form as direct-
object pronominals. This is most obvious with 3P1O gi ~ ji and 3SgO ga, but all other
pronominal right conjuncts are at least compatible with this morphological equation.
The left conjunct might then be taken to be associated with subject status. There is
some syntactic evidence for this, since expressions like 'hex and hisx mother' require
reflexivization of the possessor pronoun. However, (158d) shows that a 3Sg left
conjunct appears as 3SgF ijga rather than as ordinary 3SgS a. Left conjuncts are
therefore an ""exposed"" syntactic position in the sense of §3.8.8 and §8.4.2, unlike the
usual (proclitic) subject position.
     The subject-object asymmetry supports a bracketing [X [nda Y]], in which the
right conjunct is the immediate complement of nda. However, this judgement depends
in part on our overall interpretation of the morphosyntactic status of object pronouns,
on which see §9.1.1.
     In ""correct"" English we say he and I went, his and my (=our) house, and you saw
him and me. That is, case is assigned to the pronouns on the basis of their syntactic
function in the larger sentence, as in [you saw him] and [(you saw) me]. In colloquial
English, on the other hand, freezing of conjoined pronominal forms occurs as the old
accusative forms generalize, resulting in e.g. [him and me] went. However, this is not
usually extended to the possessive: W[him and me's] house.
     In KCh, pronominal conjunctions are invariable in form and are therefore not
sensitive morphologically to surrounding syntax, even when functioning as possessors.
Consider (160).(159)     a.   a           huu      di
               3Sg         house    Def

               '[his and my] house'     3SgO ga is used in (159c) instead of the usual 3Sg possessive a, seen in (159a),
since in (159c) the 3Sg pronoun is the right conjunct of nda and must therefore take
object (""O"") form. In an unconjoined 3Sg possessive, ga is ungrammatical (159b).
This justifies the bracketing in (159c).
     An additional consequence of the freezing of pronominal conjunctions is that
special clitic dative forms, ISg yene and 2Sg mana (§4.1.5, §5.9.2), cannot be used in
conjunctions, as shown in (160).(160)     a.   a        cerbu     ga      yene

4.1.1 Person and number categoriesThe morphologically distinct categories of personal pronouns are ISg, 1P1, 2Sg, 2P1,
3Sg, 3P1, 3SgF, 3P1F, Logo/3ReflSg, and Logo/3ReflPl. We sometimes use ""1,"" ""2"",
""3,"" ""3F,"" and ""Logo/3Refl"" (note the quotation marks) as cover terms for the
respective singular and plural categories. There are no gender or noun class distinctions;
""F* stands for ""Full"" (not ""Feminine""). An additional S or Ο at the end of a morpheme
label means ""subject"" or ""object."" Most pronouns have invariant forms, but the simple
3Sg and 3P1 forms have morphologically distinct object forms (3SgO, 3P1O), and we
make liberal use of the subject and object specifications in interlinear morpheme
glossing to make the syntax clearer.
      ISg denotes speaker, and 2Sg denotes an individual addressee. All other singular
categories (3Sg, 3SgF, Logo/3ReflSg) exclude speaker and addressee. For the semantics
of plural pronouns, see the following section.
      There is no specifically generic pronoun (Fr. on, German man), but 2Sg is
common in a generic (universal) human sense (§10.3.1).
      For the forms of third person pronouns, see §3.8.8. The primary grammatical split
in this subsystem is between ""3"" and ""3F* on the one hand and the undifferentiated
""Logo/3Refl"" (logophoric and third person reflexive) on the other. To a large extent the
difference between ""3"" and ""3F* is automatically determined by syntactic position, ""3F'
occurring in more ""exposed"" (autonomous) positions and ""3"" occurring in more or less
cliticized positions. However, both are possible as postpositional complements and as
possessors (§8.4.2).
      The Logo/3Refl pronouns express coindexation with a specific antecedent, either
the attributed source (speaker-thinker) of the proposition (as with logophorics), or a
syntactically specified NP (as with reflexives). It is possible for a Logo/3Refl pronoun
to have both functions simultaneously, as in the final pronoun of 'He, (3Sg) said [he,
(LogoSg) would hit himselfx (LogoSg & 3ReflSg),' which is coindexed both with the
quoted speaker and with the clause-mate subject. For details see §10.1.1-4 on
logophorics, and §10.2.1-4 on reflexives.
      A few examples of third person (including ""3F,"" ""Logo,"" and ""3Refl"") pronouns
are in (53-56). English gender distinctions may be helpful in keeping references clear
but have no KCh counterpart.

function, the subject variants also being used before postpositions (§4.1.1).
     Topic NPs ending with Top bine ('as for'), which precede the sentence proper, are
also unmarked for case; see §5.8.2.
     Many ""adverbs"" can be thought of as nouns or simplified NPs denoting times,
locations, and similar concepts. If so, they can be analysed as NPs unmarked for case
on the surface, though some kind of locative is implied ('tomorrow' = 'at tomorrow').

4.7 Reduplication of noun and adjective stemsReduplication is not a common process with nouns. In the following examples, the
sense of the unreduplicated stem is given after the ""<"" symbol. As with verbs (§6.4),
bisyllabic stems are favored. In one set of forms, the reduplication has clear distributive
value: oinne-dinne 'co-tribesmen' <'peer', guuru-guuru 'spare auto parts' <'(piece of)
metal', jiibt-jiibi 'dirty spots' <'dirt', jombu-jombu 'fragments, debris' <'broken-up
grains', tombi-tombi 'spots, stains' <'spot'. In two cases, reduplication is used as an ad
hoc derivational device defining one entity in terms of a better-known one: kooro-kooro
'hooked device for retrieving bucket fallen into well' <kooro 'hyena'; fendu-fendu
'cross-beam' <fendu 'winnowing van'. Nominal reduplication kaari-kaari 'maximum,
utmost' is only dubiously connected to kaari 'wait for' (perhaps DjCh kaari 'give
freely to, donate to' reflects the relevant original simple form), boyboy 'pits dug in
drying marsh to collect water' may be connected to boy '(finger-)nail' or to the verb
boy 'drive, herd', dugu-dugu 'teal' is dubiously related to dugu 'incense'.
     There are quite a few noun stems which appear to be frozen reduplications, the
simple stem being unattested. A few examples: birimbirim 'a cultivar of sorghum',
bitibiti 'mist', kusukusu 'couscous', lumbalumba 'vine sp.', totjgotorjgo 'bow
(weapon)', warawara 'coarse sieve'.
     Verbs (especially bisyllables) are reduplicated more frequently than nouns (§6.4).
Since most ""adjectives"" are suffixal derivatives of intransitive verbs, it is not surprising
that bisyllabic adjectives can be reduplicated in distributive (cf. §5.4.4) or intensive
sense. Examples are dumb-odumb-o 'meager (bits)' and keyna-keyna 'just a little'.
The form mooso-mooso 'slowly, softly, gently' is much more common than the
simple mooso (same gloss).
     The adverb gumo-gumo 'extremely', cf. gumo 'right(-handed)', is attested
dialectally but is rare in Timbuktu.
                                Chapter 5
                    Nominal inflection and NP syntax
5.1 Overview
In the previous chapter we introduced the morphemic material of NPs and examined
processes of noun-stem formation. In the present chapter we focus on the larger NP
syntax and on the analysis of relevant grammatical categories.
     The simplest NPs are personal pronouns (§4.A), which take no further marking for
definiteness or plurality. In this chapter, however, we are concerned chiefly with ""full
NPs"" headed by a lexical noun, or by another stem capable of functioning as NP head.
The latter set includes adjectives or numerals converted into NP heads by means of the
Absolute prefix a- or i- (§4.4.3, §4.5.1), demonstrative pronoun woo, and possessive
phrases with postposition wane. A ""full NP"" is any NP not consisting of a personal
pronoun.
     The maximal structure of an NP (or PP), excluding relative clause modification, is
that shown in (92).(92)          {                  coreNP                  } post-core elements
              possessor - N - Adj - Num - Dem - Def - PI - kul - DF - Postp     The ""core"" of a full NP consists of the lexical information necessary to specify the
denoted referent. This core NP is syntactically equivalent to a personal pronoun. Either
the core of a full NP, or a personal pronoun, may be followed by any of the post-core
elements: kul 'all'; a DF (discourse-functional) morpheme such as Top[ic] or
Emph[atic] (also Only' or 'also'); or a postposition. The position of kul is more
variable than indicated in (92), and it can follow DF morphemes under some
conditions. If a postposition is present, the entire phrase is a PP (postpositional
phrase).
     The lexical head is the noun in the second position of (92). It is preceded by a
possessor NP, which itself contains an NP. The head N may be followed by a
modifying adjective, a numeral, the demonstrative pronoun woo 'this, that', Def di, and
PI yo. All the positions except the noun are optional.
     Even the noun may be omitted if there is another element present that is capable of
carrying the basic information (possessor, adjective, numeral, or demonstrative). When
a possessor NP, adjective, or numeral functions as head of the NP in the absence of N,
certain morphological restrictions and adjustments apply (§5.2.3, §5.3.1, §5.4.1).
     A few examples of NPs headed by nouns or demonstrative woo are given in (93).
Post-core elements are included in the NP with universal quantifier (93d) and in the PPs
(93e-f), one of which (93f) has a DF morpheme before the postposition.

5.2 Possessives5.2.1 Possessor NPs with and without waneA possessive NP has the form [[NP (wane)] N ...], where N is the possessed noun (and
hence the lexical head of the larger NP). The possessor NP (which can be a simple
pronoun or a multi-word NP) can be followed by the Possessive postposition wane
(§5.9.3). Examples in (94).(94)      a.   a          wane       gaabi         di
               3Sg        Poss       strength Def
               'its power'
          b.   [isa here          woo yo wane] fari di         yo
               [river around Dem PI Poss] field Def PI
               'fields of (=in) those river areas'
          c.   [alhoor       di         daa      wane] ciini di     yo
               [limestone Def           Emph Poss] word      Def    PI
               'words of (=about) limestone*    However, wane is optional and may be omitted in each of (94a-c). Omission of
wane in (94a) causes no interpretive problems since the 3Sg pronoun in a gaabi di
can only be construed as possessive; likewise, ISg ay in (95a) must be possessive.
                                                                    5.2 Possessives   85When the possessor is a full noun-headed NP, omission of wane results in the
juxtaposition of two NPs, so possession may be indistinguishable from loose
compounding (§4.6.5). However, possessive and compounding readings are not always
semantically distinct, and if the possessed noun is semantically inalienable ('mother',
 'belly') the construction can safely be read as possessive, as with 'mother' in (95b).(95)     a.   ay^        naa
              ISg        mother
              'my mother'
         b.   [har     di       yo]      naa           di
              [man     Def      PI]      mother        Def
              'the men's mother'     Note that the possessor and possessed NPs are independently marked for
definiteness and for grammatical number both in (94b-c) with wane and in (95b)
without it.
     When the possessed ""noun"" is really a numeral or adjective beginning in Absolute
i- or a-, and the possessor is 3Sg a or 3P1 i, omission of wane is uncommon. The
strong preference for overt wane in this combination can be viewed as a device to avoid
a VV sequence whose contraction would obliterate categorial information. Thus a
wane^ i boyro di 'its best' (i.e., 'the best thing for it') rather than ?#a i-boyro di.
There is no problem with pronominal possessors ending in consonants: yer a-woy
Our ten'.","[98, 99, 100, 101]"

4.1.4 Subject and Object forms of pronominalsThe simplest type of NP is a bare personal pronoun. The basic forms are shown in
(58); variants and irregular allomorphs are commented on below.(58)    personal pronouns (S=subject, O=object)

58 4 Nouns, pronouns, and nominal derivation     On the optional reducation of 2SgS ni to n in some but not all morphosyntactic
positions, see §3.8.2. For irregular ISgS yc and 2SgS ma in certain combinations, see
§3.8.1-2. For numerous additional variants of rjgi-yoandrjgu-yo, see §3.8.8.
     (58) shows distinct subject and object forms for the ISg, 3Sg, and 3P1. The other
pronouns have a single, invariant form (shown in a central S=O column between the
S-only and O-only columns). In the case of ISg, the orthographic distinction reflects
what is arguably a subphonemic positional variation in the pronunciation of the
diphthong nucleus (§3.3.1). The only real subject-object variation is therefore in the
""3"" category, where the object form (which directly follows the verb) is 3Sg ga or 3P1
gi (sometimes palatalized to ji, §3.6.4). Some examples of the ISg, 3Sg, and 3P1 are
given in (59); the syntactic order is subject + verb + object as in English.","[73, 74]"
"
10.1.2 Logophorics and deictic shifts in reported speechWe begin by noting that KCh has no analogue to the tense shifts that typically occur
in reported (past) speech in languages like English, where Ί want a mango' is reported
as 'she said she wanted a mango.' The basic KCh VP categories are imperfective and
(unmarked) perfective aspect, which require no adjustment due to the temporal
displacement of reporting past speech. Schematically, Ί Impf want [mango one]'
becomes [3Sg say, LogoSg Impf want [mango one]].
     The most systematic indexical shift in reported speech is the replacement of
original first person pronouns by a type of pronoun known as ""logophoric,"" which is
used only for this purpose. In KCh, logophoric pronouns are identical in form to third
person reflexive (""3Refl"") pronouns. The basic Logo/3ReflSg pronoun is ijgu, with
plural counterpart ggu-yo or ggi-yo, the latter variant homophonous to the plural of
3SgF pronoun rjga (§5.8.2, §8.4.2). For analysis of the forms, with further variants,
see §3.8.8.
     Logo/3ReflSg ijgu ~ ηυ is easy to distinguish from 3SgF rjga in most
environments. However, both combine with a following Impf o to give phonetic
[qgo:]. Our transcriptional system uses underlying representations plus a ligature to
indicate that contraction (§3.7.1) has occurred, hence we write qgu^ ο or qga^ ο
depending on which pronoun is involved. Readers working through published texts
presented with this ligature format should appreciate that each such transcription
represents an interpretation of the text fragment in question. On occasion a serious
analyst of KCh texts may disagree with the transcriber's interpretation, or conclude
that alternative readings are possible.
     In interlinear glosses, I not only distinguish between ""3F* and ""Logo/3Refl""
forms, I also try to specify logophoric and reflexive functions of the latter. This
functional distinction is often straightforward, but in quite a few textual instances the
pronoun in question has both functions. For example, in 'shex said [she, would prepare
herselfj,' 'herself,' is both 3Refl (within its clause) and Logo (coindexed with the
quoted speaker). In ambiguous or doubly-marked cases we will use the noncommittal
""Logo/3Refl"" label in interlinears. It is also possible to have doubly logophoric
pronouns, as in 'she, said [shex would tell him [to hit her,]],' where the final pronoun
324     10 Anaphora, logophorics, and reported speechhas the same referent as antecedent at two higher levels, but we do not distinguish
double from single logophoricity in interlinears.
    Examples of (nonreflexive) logophoric pronouns are in (619).(619)     a.   i-i         bar [ngu-yo        gaazwal     hay] goo^ a        ra,

                among themx, (that) you are one of theirx members.'","[339, 340]"
"
4.1.5 Pronominal forms as possessors and before postpositionsPronouns used as possessors of a following head noun take the same form used in
subject function, allowing of course for regular phonological rules. Examples with
harme 'brother' (abbreviated ""B"") are ay harme di 'my B', yer harme di Our B', IM
h rme di 'your(Sg) B', war harme di 'your(Pl) B', a harme di 'his or her (3Sg) B',
ι harme di 'their (3P1) B', ηgu harme di 'his or her (Logo/3ReflSg) B', and ijgi-ya
harme di 'their (Logo/3ReflPl) B'. There is no general avoidance of or reluctance to
use simple 3Sg or 3P1 pronouns in possessive function in KCh. (KS, on the other
hand, does avoid 3Sg and 3P1 possessive pronouns.) However, ""3F' pronouns are
sometimes used instead of 3Sg and 3P1 in possessor function, as noted in §3.8.8.
     Postpositions specify marked cases, generally spatial in nature. Personal pronouns
use the subject rather than object form (if overtly different), before a postposition. In
the dative only, the ISg and 2Sg have special irregular forms in the normal postverbal
(enclitic) position. In (62), last column, ""=S"" means ""same as subject form.""(62)    personal pronoun forms before postpositions

"     The use of simple reflexive pronouns like 3Refl in direct-object function is
therefore basically limited to verbs where agent-patient merger is common, and indeed
where the two roles are not sharply distinguished in the event structure. Even within
this semantic type, reflexive transitive verbs are nowhere near as common as in
French, Spanish, and other European languages.",[349]

6.2.1 Zero derivation (simple verbs with variable valency)Here we discuss cases where the same verb stem is used with variable valency. In
§4.3.2 we discussed similar cases where a stem may be used as a verb or noun without
derivational affixes. Subsequent sections will describe overt morphological derivations
which change valency.
     In (204), S and Ο stand for the referents functioning as subject and direct object,
respectively, in the transitive case.(204)       verb        intransitive gloss          transitive gloss (O = direct object)

         d. kaa         'S come'                    'S become (turn into) O'     In (204a-b), the grammatical subject of the intransitive corresponds to the direct
object of the transitive. In (204a), the intransitive events or states can occur in the
absence of an external agent, so we might argue that the transitive usage is the
semantic factitive-causative of the intransitive. On the other hand, in (204b) the
intransitive events or states strongly imply the presence of an (unexpressed) agent, so
134 6 Verbal voice and verb derivationwe could argue that here the intransitive usage is a semantic passive based on the
transitive. In (204c), the intransitive omits the direct object of the transitive, so the
intransitive can be thought of as a kind of antipassive.
     In (204d), the connection between 'come* and 'become' is less transparent, but
English come to be, and the use of motion verbs to mean 'become' in many other
languages (Fr. devenir, Spanish volverse), makes the connection more reasonable.
KCh kaa 'become' is formally a transitive verb, and the direct object can be a pronoun
like 3SgO ga, as in (205).(205)         ay     kaa    ga
              ISgS become 3SgO

66 4 Nouns, pronouns, and nominal derivation      The cases in (71a-b) involve stems ending in L In some of these cases the noun is
actually an old abstractive in suffix *-i (still productive in KS). This is clearly true of
gaaniand haawi (7la), where comparative evidence points to verbs *gaan 'dance' and
*haaw 'be ashamed', and to nominalizations *gaan-i 'dance' and *haaw-i 'shame';
KCh has generalized the old noun forms to both functions. There are a few other
apparent vestiges of the *-/ suffix. Related to duma 'sow (millet)', aside from
duma-rey 'seeds' mentioned in the preceding section there is another form dumi
 'seeds', ciimi 'truth' (*oiim-i) and ciini 'language' (*ciin-i) are discussed in §3.10.7.
      In (71b), there is no comparable direct evidence that the noun originally had the *-i
suffix and the nominal and verbal forms may simply involve the same stem.
     The cases in (71c-d), a very small sampling of the many observed examples,
illustrate the difficulty of determining the direction of derivation (verbalization of noun,
or nominalization of verb). (71c) involves verbs of adjectival quality, and the nouns can
be taken as derived on semantic grounds. (7Id) involves more active verbs. If we take
the (7Id) verbs as basic, we can analyse some nouns as product-of-action nominals
('song', 'fold', perhaps 'bubbles'), Instrumentals ('key'), verbal nouns ('beginning'), or
characteristic patient ('kid'). In several cases, though, we could also take the nouns as
basic and analyse the verbs as expressing some more general action involving the
denoted entities, e.g. 'sing' = 'make a song', 'be bubbly' = 'make bubbles', 'lock' =
'shut with key', 'pamper' = 'treat like a kid'.
     Compound verbs of the type [verb ka verb], linked by Infinitival ka, can have
zero-derived nominals: koy ka kaa 'go and come' (verb) or 'going and coming'
(noun). Derivatives, especially causatives, are easily nominalized: jur^ndi 'cause to run,
drive' (verb) or 'driving' (noun).
     There are a handful of cases where a noun-verb pair of the same general type as in
(7 Id) involves a small phonological difference. These presumably reflect old
derivational mechanisms, no longer productive. Entirely irregular are fun 'pierce'
versus rune 'hole'; fiisi 'sweep' versus fisaa 'broom'; and hawru 'eat evening meal'
versus hawre 'evening meal (noun); eat evening meal (verb)'.","[81, 82]"
"    Intermediate between the bare-noun type saa kul and the type with full NP seen in
(107a-b) is one where the noun stem bound by kul takes Def di but cannot take PI yo.
This type is reliably distinguishable from the type (107a-b) only with countable nouns.
An example is (108).(108)           tuuri      sii         di     kul
                tree       kind        Def    all
                'every kind of tree'     This construction is regular with sii 'type'. Although the phrase in (108) is used
in precisely the same contexts as English all kinds of trees, in Songhay it is a
distributive and its kul is best glossed 'every' rather than 'all*.
     Another pattern with more emphatically distributive meaning involves adding kul
to a noun already quantified by the numeral foo One' or its distributive reduplication
foo-foo One by one'. Examples are in (109).(109)      a.   [[jere      foo]        kul]    a-taaci
                [[side      one]        all]    Absol-four
                '(on) each side, (there are) four'
           b.   [[[yer kuna] a-foo-foo]            kul] go jisi qgu    caaku di nee
                [[[1P1 Loc] Absol-one-one] all] Impf put SReflSgsack Def here
                'Each one of us will put his (or her) sack down here.'
                                                5.4 Numerals and other quantifiers      91      It is clear that kul here has scope over the already quantified inner NP. Compare
English every single side. Note that in (109b) the subject NP is treated syntactically as
singular, and therefore binds a singular (not plural) 3Refl pronoun later in the sentence.
In (109b), yer kuna (literally 'in us') is partitive in function (§5.4.10).
      When kul 'all, every' is used as (apparent) NP head in the absence of a real noun,
it is expressed phonetically as singular [akul] or as plural [ikul]. There are two possible
ways to analyse (and transcribe) these forms. First, we could take the initial vowels as
special cases of the Absolute prefix, which is prefixed to adjectives and numerals when
they function as NP heads, the usual form being i- before ordinary adjectives and a-
before numerals (§4.4.3, §4.5.1). We would then have to specify that, before kul, we
get a unique number differentiation of the Absol not found with adjectives or numerals.
The transcriptions would be a-kul and i-kul. This is the system we will actually use in
transcriptions. We will gloss a- as AbsolSg and i- as AbsolPl in these combinations,
instead of just as Absol as elsewhere. Examples in (110).(110)    a. a-kul                  ο           baa-baa
            AbsolSg-all           Impf         Rdp-break
            'All of it will break' (= 'It will all break')
         b. no-o               soo        i-kul              se
            2SgS-Impf          pour       AbsolPl-all        Dat

                                         qu-yo, qu-ye, qu-ya     We normally transcribe the plural forms as single words, e.g. qgi-yo. One could
argue, however, that two-word transcriptions like qgi yo are structurally appropriate,
even though the two components seem to interact phonologically in ways that do not
apply to combinations of noun stems plus PI yo. There is one possible piece of direct
evidence for the two-word representation, viz., the (uncommon) elicited sequence qgi
woo yo 'they (there)', with demonstrative woo apparently inserted between the two
parts of qgi yo (§5.5). However, qgi woo yo is structurally parallel to yer woo yo
'we here' with 1P1 pronoun yer, and the fact that we get qgi (not qga or qgu) in qgi
woo yo suggests that this phrase might better be analysed as a contraction of //rjgi-yo
woo yo// with two instances of the PI morpheme.
48   3 Phonology     3SgF qga and Logo/3Refl qgu are normally indistinguishable as subject markers
before Impf o, since VV-Contraction (§3.7.1) applies, giving [rjgo:] in both cases. In
our practical transcription we maintain the underlying distinction, using the ligature to
indicate that contraction occurs: qga^ ο versus ggu^ o. In transcribing texts, we must
use judgement in deciding which transcription is valid in each instance, and readers
have the right to second-guess our judgements.
     The morphosyntactic environments which allow unmarked ""3"" pronouns, and
those which require a shift to ""3F' (Full) pronouns, are given and exemplified in
§8.4.2. In general, unmarked ""3"" pronouns are used when they are not directly modified
(by a following Top, Emph, Foe, or other DF morpheme, by demonstrative woo, or
any adjective or quantifier), and when they function as arguments of a following
element or phrase (subject, postpositional complement, possessor). These can be
described informally as ""proclitic"" positions. The variant ""3"" pronouns, 3SgO ga and
3P1O gi ~ ji, are used in direct object function (immediately following a verb), and as
complements of the preposition nda 'with, and' (including right conjunct position in
""X and Y""). These can be thought of informally as ""enclitic"" positions. By contrast,
the ""exposed"" positions requiring the shift from ""3"" to ""3F' forms are those where the
pronoun is a phrasal head followed by a modifier or DF morpheme, or occurs in
isolation.
     Typical examples of 3SgF gga are qga bine 'as for 3Sg' and the left conjunct in
ηga nda gi (""3SgF and 3ΡΓ). 3Sg a would be ungrammatical in these positions: #a
bine, #a nda gi. The sequence a bine is grammatical in a different sense 'his heart'.
     In possessor function, ""3F' pronouns can be used instead of 3Sg a or 3P1 i. This
option is especially common when the following noun stem begins with a vowel,
which could trigger VV-Contraction and therefore cause the 3Sg or 3P1 morpheme to
disappear. Thus instead of tila^albarka 'its spiritual power' we normally get either ijga^
albarka with 3SgF pronoun, or a wane^ albarka with overt possessive postposition.
However, ""3F' pronouns are also sporadically used instead of 3Sg or 3P1 in possessor
function even before C-initial stems.","[63, 64]"
"
5.5 Demonstrative wooDem woo 'this, that' (§4.2.1) follows nouns (123a), as well as modifying adjectives
and numerals (123b), but precedes Def di and PI yo. It can also occur after personal
pronouns (123c), in which case our free translation is of the type Ί here'.(123)    a    bar        woo     di       yo

98      5 Nominal inflection and NP syntax     The combination woo di including Def di is very common, but woo occurs
without di in deictic (pointing) function, where 'this' is the most common translation.
di is not used after woo modifying a first or second person pronoun (123c). woo
without di can also be used with a generic or other nonspecific noun, previously
introduced as a discourse referent, in preposed topic function (124).(124)          aywa,         ndooso       woo,    ni       bey    ka     guna

"      Here there are not one but two pronominal postverbal constituents, direct object
ga and Dat war se. We may consider this to be an enclitic string, attached as a whole
to the verb bar. In such cases, the direct object enclitic obligatorily precedes any
cliticized PP.
      The cliticization analysis is useful in accounting for pronominal morphology as
well as constituent order. In (438) we have an instance of 3SgO ga, which differs in
form from a short 3Sg allomorph a. The longer ga is used in direct object function, in
which case it immediately follows the verb (for a 'give' construction with two such
object clitics, see the following section), ga is also the 3Sg form following the
preposition nda 'and, with'. The a variant is used in other functions including subject,
possessor of NP, and object of postposition. The 3P1 variants gi and i follow the same
pattern (§4.1.1). We could argue that the gV variants are required when the third person
pronominal is a) enclitic (to a verb or ndä), and b) is not bracketed with another
following morpheme (i.e., a postposition).
      Alternatively, we could limit enclitic status to direct-object pronouns, in which
case condition (b) could be dispensed with since PPs would not be covered. But a good
case can be made for taking certain pronominal PPs as clitics. First, the ordering of
pronominal PPs before nonpronominal complements, as in (437), seems to be
obligatory with certain postpositions; the rare counterexamples in texts probably
reflect clause-internal repairs and are not confirmed in elicitation. Second, irregular
forms for the ISg and 2Sg dative combinations, used only in postverbal position, are
best analysed as special enclitic forms. Consider (439).(439)    a.   a-a           jafa      yene         alhoor di
              3SgS-Impf carve         ISgDat limestone Def

80 4 Nouns, pronouns, and nominal derivation     The first few examples involve ethnic groups (87a), occupations (87b),
socioeconomic statuses (87c), and biological and kinship statuses (87d). In these cases,
the ""X"" noun, used by itself, denotes a person of the relevant type ('Bozo person',
 'mason', 'noble', man'), and -terey generalizes this to the respective larger class. Like
e.g. English nobility, the KCh compounds can denote either the idealized essential
nature of this class (skill in masonry, the proper exercise of noble class, the ideal
emotional attachments and sense of obligation in kinship relations), or the set of
members of the larger class ('His nobility impresses me' vs. 'The nobility oppose any
concessions to the serfs'). The essential-nature reading seems semantically primary.
     In (87e), we get more general abstractions that are not prescriptively connected
with prior statuses, alhaasidi 'self-centered person' denotes a person of the relevant
type, but alwaajib means Obligatory' and leselmeans 'authentic'.
     In (87f) we have a couple of special cases where the compound can or must be used
as a verb. These are probably secondary verbalizations of older nominal compounds.
Compare the ""verbal"" use of haya foo '(do) anything' discussed in §7.1.5.
     In (88), -terey appears to function semantically as a suffix to a possessed noun
'your wife':(88)         a          hun       [ni      wande-terey]
             3SgS       leave     [2Sg     wife-hood]

4.4.3 Adjectives as NP heads with Absolute prefix i-When the adjectival forms of §4.4.2 are used as apparent lexical heads of NPs (i.e.
when they follow an empty noun slot), they additionally require an Absolute prefix.
For modifying adjectives of the sort described in the preceding section, and for -nte
participles when treated as adjectives (rather than as nouns), the prefix is /'-. See §4.5.1
for the more complex system of numerals, several of which have a-.
     The Absol prefix may be compared roughly to English one (as in α big one, two
big ones), which likewise allows an adjective to occur in a NP without a true noun.
Some examples of verbs of adjectival quality and their adjectival derivatives are given
in (80). We include one verb (futu 'be bad') which adds Participle ending -nte to form
the corresponding adjective (§4.3.4).",[89]
"
6.2.4 Minor uses of -ndiIn a few cases, a segmentable -ndi functions neither as factitive-causative nor as
mediopassive.
     In one case, -ndi acts as a denominal verbalizer: ciwsi ~ cipsi 'sacrificial ram'
(<Ar.), ciwsi-ndi 'slaughter (sacrificial ram)'.
     cerbu 'show' (cf. §6.1.4) and cerbu-ndi 'demonstrate, explain' are both
ditransitives. cerbu is preferred when a physical entity is shown (ostension), while
cerbu-ndi is preferred when an abstract matter is explained verbally.
     From cii 'speak' (intransitive or transitive) we get regular mediopassive cii-ndi 'be
said', pronounced [tfi(i)ndi] with vowel length unreliably expressed (§3.7.9). The very
common verb oindi 'remain, keep (doing)' is perhaps historically related to the
equational copula ci 'be', but both are intransitive.
     In addition to these grammatically unusual verbal examples, there are a few cases
where -ndi occurs in a derived noun, bita is the term for 'millet porridge' (a staple
food), while bita-ndi denotes another type of porridge made from millet pudding (local
Fr. to). In two cases, the noun is probably a zero nominalization (§4.3.2) of a verbal
derivative with -ndi. These are noo-ndi 'gift' (homophonous with mediopassive
noo-ndi 'be given') and waasu-ndi 'dish made with boiled meat' (homophonous with
causative waasu-ndi 'bring to a boil').
     The noun faraandi means 'quarter (section of city)'. The form suggests faraa
'fatigue' (noun) or 'be tired' and its causative faraa-ndi 'bother, weary', but there is no
obvious semantic link.
                                                      6.2 Derived voice forms      1376.2.5 Suffixation of -nda to verb stemIn §6.1.6 we discussed verbs which commonly take an instrumental-comitative
complement (nda 'with' plus NP), perhaps separated from the verb by an intervening
constituent. There are also some combinations where the -nda seems to act as a suffix
on the verb, creating a derived transitive. The two constructions can be schematized as
in (210a-b).(210)    a.   [subjectNP]        V          ...    [nda [NP]]
         b.   [subject NP]       V-nda      ...    [NP]     There is no clearly audible difference between (210a) and (210b) when no other
constituents intervene, but when there is such an intervening constituent the
distinction is clear. It is probable that the type (210b) is historically derived from
(210a) by redrawing of word boundaries. (210b) is typical of comitative function
('along with, together with'), whereas the instrumental function of ('by means of) is
normally expressed as (210a).
     The examples which we ascribe to (21 Ob), with derivational verb suffix -nda, are
given in (211). ""S"" and ""O"" denote the referents functioning as subject and direct
object, respectively, in the derived form.(211)         stem gloss                      derivative   gloss
         a.   koy    'S go'                   koy-nda      'S take O, deliver O'
              kaa    'S come'                 kaa-nda      'S bring O'
              yee    'S go or come back'      yee-nda      'S take or bring back O'
         b.   gey    'S endure, be long time' gey-nda      'S be long away from O'
              fey    'S diverge; S divorce O' fey-nda      'S be separable from O'

              tilasu Ό be necessary'          tilasu-nda   'S need O'     Sentential examples showing other postverbal constituents (e.g. datives)
intervening between -nda and the direct object are given in (212).(212)    a.   ay     kaa-nda       mana      attee
              ISgS come-with 2SgDat tea
              Ί have brought some tea for you(Sg).'
         b.   yee         ta fey-nda           mana [ni        w nde di]

         c.   yee           hima-nda      a      se     hay si
              ISgSImpf      resemble 3Sg Dat dog
              Ί resemble a dog for him (=from his point of view).'
138 6 Verbal voice and verb derivation      There are similar examples involving koy-nda, yee-nda, gey-nda, sawa-nda, and
 tilasu-nda. For kubey-nda I have no example of the type seen in (212), since with
object separated from verb by an intervening dative, informants preferred to use the
synonymous underived kubey.
      The fusion of -nda with the verb is strong in the case of the motion verbs in
(211 a). Note that in cases like 'S brings O', both subject and object are in most cases
jointly in motion. The apparent historical shift from 'S came [with O]' to 'S brought
O' is therefore straightforward and is known from many languages. The remaining
examples, lumped together in (2lib), are fairly diverse in type. Aside from the
smallish number of verbs affected, we notice considerable semantic divergence. In the
case of hima, the simple stem is a serial verb used in the Ought to' construction,
which has little connection to 'resemble'. Note that tilasu-nda has a different logical
relation to the corresponding simple stem than do the other examples.
      When a causative is made from VERB-nda Y, we get VERB-Caus X [nda Y],
where nda 'with' is liberated from the verb and forms an independent constituent with
its (comitative) complement NP, generally not immediately adjacent to the causative
verb. Compare kubey-nda 'encounter' in (21 Ib) with causative kuboy-ndi ... nda
 'cause to meet' in (213); cf. beginning of §5.11.3, above, (kubey and kuboy are
variants of the same stem.) The complement of nda has been extracted by
relativization in (213a), but this is irrelevant to the point at hand.(213)    a.   hay di kaa yerkoy kuboy-ndi_^ ey           [nda 17 ci woo yo
              thing Def Rel God        meet-CauT ISgO [with t ] be Dem PI

"
4.4.2 Adjectives as noun modifiers (suffix -o or zero)Verbs of adjectival quality can ordinarily be used as modifying adjectives in NPs, in
which case they take a lexically specified form. Those which do not take the participle
form (§4.3.4) either take an Adj ending -o, or take zero affix. We begin with the cases
of -o in (78).",[88]
"     In both the enumerating and possessive constructions, the pronoun in question
precedes the quantifier. When the quantifier is kul 'all', we get clearcut enumerating
expressions like war kul 'all of you(Pl)'. However, with numerals, the preferred
96      5 Nominal inflection and NP syntaxsurface expression adds a head noun distinct from the pronoun. The usual noun used for
this purpose is boro 'person', as in (119).(119)          yer     boro      hinja
               1P1     person    three
               'we three'       Here yer might be said to be in apposition to boro or perhaps to boro hinja. But
it is also possible to construe (119) syntactically as a possessive expression, glossable
as Our three persons' (cf. English the three of us). This is because possessors
(including pronominal possessors) precede the heads nouns they modify and only
optionally take Poss postposition wane (§4.1.5, §5.2.1).
       What then about unambiguously possessive constructions like Our three'
(simplified from Our three dogs' or the like), with an unexpressed but understood head
noun? The expected maximal version of this is of the type [yer ( wane )] 0 i-hinja,
lit. '[1P1 (Poss)] 0 Absol-three,' with ""0"" representing the vacant head-noun slot. This
is quite grammatical and relevant examples occur in texts. However, again bow
'person' is optionally added as a dummy noun stem, sometimes even when the referent
in question is nonhuman, as in (120).(120)          yer    (wane)       boro      hinja
               1P1    (Poss)       person    three
               Our three'     Note that possessive (120) is distinguishable from enumerating (119) only by the
presence of the optional Poss postposition, and the latter is more often omitted than
present. The syntactic distinction between enumerating and possessive types is
therefore shaky. For an English parallel note the phrasing of the three of us, which has
enumerating function but which is expressed in possessive form (of).","[111, 112]"
"
5.2.4 Inalienable possessionIn general there is no special morphosyntax of inalienable possession (e.g. body parts,
kin terms), except insofar as some types of nouns are normally possessed. However,
the noun moy 'namesake' (i.e., anyone with the same personal name), which is always
possessed, does have the unusual feature of avoiding Def di, hence ay moy 'my
namesake', plural ay moy yo (not#ay moy dior#ay moy di yo).
                                                                  5.3 Adjectives      87
5.3 Adjectives
5.3.1 Syntax of simple adjectivesWe can define ""adjective"" syntactically as an element which may occur immediately
after a lexical noun (as head of NP), preceding a numeral if the latter is present. Most
of the common adjectives are derived from intransitive verbs of adjectival quality
(§4.4.1), for example jeen 'be aged', Adj[ective] form jeen-o. Adj suffix -o is very
common in such adjective forms but there is some lexical variation (§4.4.2).
     Another class of syntactic adjectives are the -nte ordinals (derived from numerals)
and participles (derived from various types of verb, and rarely from nouns), § 4.3.4.
Examples are hirjka-nte 'second', albarka-nte 'powerful', and tey-nte 'wet'.
     Examples of adjectives (including participles), with following numeral, are in
(100).(100)    a.   har      jeen-o         hiqka
              man      old-Adj        two
              'two old men'
         b.   derbe        tey-nte            taaci    di
              boubou       wet-Partpl       four     Def
              'the four wet boubous (men's outer garments)'     If an adjective is present but the head noun is absent, the adjective can be said to
function as the head of the NP. In this case, an Absolute prefix is added; this is,
arguably, a dummy element which fills an otherwise vacant ""noun"" slot. The Absol
prefix is /- (§4.4.3), as in (101).(101)    a.   i-jeen-o         di
              Absol-old-Adj Def
              'the old one'
         b.   i-tey-nte           taaci   di
              Absol-wet-Partpl four       Def
              'the four wet ones'     In these respects, adjectives are similar morphologically and syntactically to
numerals, though numerals take a different Absol prefix, either a- or zero (§4.5.1). The
quantifying adjectives bobo 'much, many' and ciina 'few' are morphologically
indistinguishable from ordinary adjectives.","[102, 103]"
"
4.3.3 Characteristic nominals (-koy, -koyni, -kom)There is a simple noun kokoy meaning 'leader, chief. It appears to have a short form
-koy in the now-frozen yerkoy 'God' (originally Our Leader' with 1P1 pronoun yef).
     The forms -koy and -koyni, which are probably historically related to kokoy, occur
in a considerable number of derived nominals used to define the status of a person by
reference to some salient personal feature or activity. We will refer to these morphemes
as Characteristic] nominalizers.
     -koy can be added to noun or verb stems, while -koyni seems to be added only to
noun stems, -koy is much more common than -koyni overall. All examples of -koyni
involve permanent and fundamentally important characteristics. Some examples of
-koy are of this type, but -koy can also be used to denote transient characteristics or
roles ('assailant') or relations to specific others ('close friend'). The only doublets I
know of are faraa-koy 'weary person' plus faraa-koyni 'person living in misery' (verb
                                                            4.3 Nominalizations       67faraa 'be weary* or 'suffer', noun faraa 'weariness' or 'suffering'), and gaabi-koy
alongside gaabi-koyni 'strong person' (noun gaabi 'strength').
     The full set of -koyni derivatives in my data is given as (72). A generous sample
of examples of -koy is displayed in (73).","[82, 83]"
"     The material following the quotative verb har 'say' is attributed to the quoted
speaker (here, 'my father'). In such contexts, the logophoric pronoun ngu is used
instead of the usual 3Sg pronouns (a, ga) to denote the quoted speaker, in any
syntactic position. Therefore an ordinary 3Sg pronoun must denote another third
person referent, distinct from the quoted speaker. We use subscripted indexes {x,y, ...}
to clarify the relationships in such sentences.
     The form ngu can also be used in non-reported-speech contexts as a third person
reflexive (3Refl), as in (23):(23)          a          haabu          ngu
              3SgS       prepare        3ReflSgO

between the subject NP and the verb. The type of modality they express is generally
deontic rather than epistemic; more specifically, the modal value is usually hortative,
imperative, or desiderative. However, as in some European languages, the subjunctive
is largely confined to complement clauses. It is common as the complement of a
quotative verb, in which case it is used to report an original imperative, as in (24).(24)         ni     bar [ay      ma         koy]
             2SgS say [ISgS Subju           go]
             'You(Sg) told me to go.'","[30, 31]"
"With 3SgF rjga, for example, we can get ηga (isolation form), rjga bine (Top), rjga ta
(weak Top), rjga rjga (SFoc), rjga na (nonsubject Foe), rjga daa (Emph), ηga nin
('only'), rjga moo ('also'), rjga woo with demonstrative, and rjga nda gi ('...and
they'). Contrast the ungrammatical alternatives with regular 3Sg a: #a bine
(grammatical in another sense 'his or her heart'), #a ta, #a rjga, #a na, #a daa, #a
nin,#a moo,#a woo,#a nda gi.
      In these exposed positions, the ""3P' pronoun is highlighted by virtue of an
accompanying overt modifier or attachment, or by virtue of syntactic position. By
contrast, regular ""3"" pronouns like 3Sg a occur without modifiers in nonexposed,
clitic-like positions within larger phrases or sentences (subject, object, possessor,
complement of postposition, complement to the right of nda 'with, and')· Subject,
possessor, and postpositional complement are proclitic, while object and right
complement of nda are enclitic.
      ""3F"" can optionally be used instead of ""3"" pronouns in possessor function and as
postpositional complement (especially with noun-like postpositions); see (54a) in
§4.1.1, above. We may speak of this as the ""facultative"" use of ""3F."" It is fairly
uncommon, except before V-initial noun stems where a simple 3Sg a or 3P1 / might
disappear due to VV-Contraction (36), §3.7.1.
      Since ""3F"" pronouns are used in isolation and before DF morphemes, there is
some association between this pronominal category and the expression of topicality
(as well as that of focus). An example is (371).(371)         rjga     ta       alhoor    di nda n       kow ga
              3SgF Top limestone Def if 2SgS remove 3SgO

repetition of 'limestone' establishes it as the topic of the following clauses.
     The Timbuktu dialect, however, makes less extensive use than KS of preposed
topical expressions based on ijga. In particular, in Timbuktu KCh, a preposed 3SgF
rjga generally denotes a person or other simple discourse referent. In KS, by contrast, a
preposed rjga phrase often has more abstract reference, denoting the preceding situation
(or proposition), suggesting translations like 'that being the case,...'","[226, 227]"

11.3 Perception     Perception predicates, as in English, have a subject NP representing the perceiver
and a direct object representing the perceived object or its sensory emanation. The
primary verbs, all transitive, are given in (710). mom normally means 'hear, listen,
understand (words, language)', but has the sense 'smell' in connection with an object
like hew 'wind, air, odor'. The verb maata is a more abstract stem meaning 'become
aware of, through unspecified sensory channels.

4.5.2 Compound numeralsMultiples of ten, from 'forty' to 'ninety', are constructed by compounding woy 'ten'
and a following numeral from 'four' to 'nine', with irregular phonological contractions
in the cases of '50', '60', and '70' to shorten final long vowels or to reduce bulky
consonant clusters: woy-taaci 'forty', woy-gu 'fifty', woy-du 'sixty', woy-ye
'seventy', woy-yaaha 'eighty', and woy-yaaga 'ninety'. Note in particular that gnu
76 4 Nouns, pronouns, and nominal derivation 'five' loses its vowel length in woy-gu 'fifty', even in combinations like woy-gu di
 'the fifty' where vowel length (if present) would be clearly audible.
      These combinations could be analysed as 'four tens', etc. Although woy in the
sense 'ten' takes the Absol prefix (a-woy) where syntactically appropriate, the larger
multiples such as woy-taaci do not, and so are used without modification as heads of
NPs (and in counting).
      Regular (unconnected) numeral phrases are used for hundreds (jo g ) and thousands
(jember): jorjgu hinja 'three hundred', jember guu 'five thousand'. One hundred' is
usually just jorjgu, while One thousand' is always jember foo including the numeral
One'. The French loan milyo 'million' has the same pattern: milyö foo One million'.
      Compound numerals from 'eleven' to 'nineteen' are expressed as woy^cindi-... 'ten-
remainder-...' plus the uncontracted single-digit numeral, e.g., woy^cindi-guu 'fifteen'
and woy^cindi-iiye'seventeen'. Note that here guu 'five' preserves its long vowel. In
Timbuktu, the y of woy- regularly assimilates to the following palatoalveolar to give
[tif] (§3.6.3). The Absol prefix is used where appropriate in such combinations:
a-woy^cindi-guu 'fifteen (of them)'.
      The same kind of compound with cindi 'remain' as linker is used for compound
numerals involving a multiple of ten plus a single digit, e.g., waraqka-cindi-yaaha
'twenty-eight' and     [woy-gu]-oindi-hirjka'fifty-tv/o\
      Combinations involving two or more parts (thousands, hundreds, 1-99) stitch the
parts together with nda 'and, with' (§5.11). For example, '1,500 riyals' is expressed as
(83).(83)        allaara    [[jember          foo]   nda     [jorjgu        guu]]
            riyal      [[thousand        one]   and     [hundred       five]]
4.5.3 Other quantificational modifiersFor predications of existence (There is an X'), see §7.2. Within a NP, there is no pure
existential quantifier, but foo One' sometimes approaches it. For this and other
relevant constructions see §5.4.2.
      The morpheme kul is often used as a kind of universal quantifier. It occurs in a
wide range of syntactic positions, both within NPs and clause-finally. See §5.4.3 for
its role as quantifier within NPs, and §9.5.10 for its clause-final uses.
      Numerals may be reduplicated, as in a-foo-foo One by one, one each' and
a-higka-hirjka 'two by two, two each'. As heads of NP, as in these two examples, the
Absol prefix is used once and is not repeated before the repeat occurrence of the
numeral. These reduplicated numerals generally have distributive function (§5.4.4).
      When a set is divided into two or more complementary subsets of one or more
individuals, to which different predications are applied ('Some stayed here, the others
left'), KCh generally uses symmetrical segments of the general type 'some ones ... ,
some ones ...' or 'the one ... , the one ..."" See §5.4.5 for details.
      The primary generalized quantifiers are ciina 'few, infrequent, rare' and bobo
'many, much' (corresponding to intransitive verbs oiina and bow). Formally, these are
ordinary adjectives like those treated in §4.4. For details on usage, see §5.4.6.

4.6 Nominal compounds
4.6. l N-N (tight) and NP-N (loose) compoundsWe speak of the first component as the ""(compound) initial"" and of the following
component as the ""(compound) final."" In compounds involving two nouns, the final is
ordinarily the lexical head and the initial is a modifier. Some specialized finals may not
fit this pattern.
      Highly lexicalized compounds normally take the form N,-N2 with no intervening
morphemes. An example is maale-banna 'apprentice' (literally 'master-slave',
construable as 'slave of the master'). We may refer to these as ""tight"" compounds.
Such a compound functions syntactically as a noun stem.
      On the other hand, in ""loose"" compounds the initial and final are more
autonomous, and the initial may be followed by its own definite or plural marking
where semantically appropriate. A possessor preceding a loose compound may have
broad scope over the entire compound NP or narrow scope over the initial only. Loose
compounds might themselves be analysed as possessive constructions in which the
Poss postposition wane is omitted. An example is (84).","[91, 92, 93]"

5.11 Instrumental, comitative, and conjoined NPsnda is very common as a clause-initial 'if subordinator in the antecedent clause of a
conditional (§9.5.1). However, in the present chapter we are concerned with the syntax
and semantics of the sentence-internal phrase type nda NP. In the following sections
we interpret ""NP"" broadly to include pronouns and NP-like adverbials, except when (as
in §5.11.2) we speak specifically of ""full NPs"" (i.e., NPs headed by a noun stem).
     In the conjunction X nda Y, where X and Υ are NPs, the morpheme nda appears
at first glance to be an operator which handles its left and right conjuncts
symmetrically, producing a phrase of the same syntactic type as the conjuncts. In the
following two sections we will question the apparent symmetry of nda.
     The phrase type nda NP with a single overt argument NP is also common. It is
the basic instrumental phrase, and can also be used as a comitative phrase. It usually
functions semantically as part of a VP (see §5.11.3).
     As an 'and' conjunction, nda is restricted to conjoining syntactic NPs (including
pronouns) and NP-like adverbials. To a limited extent, it can also conjoin
postpositional phrases involving postpositions with noun-like character, but it does
not seem to work with the most highly grammaticalized postpositions and cannot
conjoin prepositional phrases (with Instr-Comit nda or with bilaa 'without', §5.11.6).
Furthermore, nda cannot be used as an 'and' conjunction linking two verbs, inflected
VPs, or clauses. The closest functional equivalent to ""conjunction"" in such cases is the
addition of an infinitival VP beginning in ka (§9.7.1, §6.3.2) to a preceding VP. When
nda is clause-initial, it functions not as an 'and' conjunction, rather as an 'if
conjunction in conditional antecedent clauses (§9.5.1).
     An apparent counterexample to the claim that nda 'and' is not used to conjoin
clauses is (156).

3.2 Oral vowelsDjCh has seven phonemic vowel qualities to five for KCh. DjCh distinguishes e from
ε and ο from o in both short and long vowels. To my knowledge, no other Songhay
variety has such a seven-vowel system, and our working hypothesis must therefore be
that it represents an innovation in DjCh, and may reflect contact with Bambara and
other languages with phonetic open [ε] and [o] vowels. However, working out the
historical developments in detail is a matter for future research.
     Minimal pairs include cee 'time (instance)' versus cee 'foot', and moo 'also'
versus moo 'eye' (also moo 'rice'). The stems cited are native Songhay items and have
cognates in KCh, KS, and other Songhay varieties. In other cases, one or both of the
paired items has no obvious Songhay etymology and is suspected of being a loanword:
koo 'become dry' and koo 'baobab fruit' have good Songhay pedigrees, but koo
'winnowing van' does not. In the case of horso 'type of griot' and horso 'scythe', both
stems may be loans.
     Certain speakers distinguish qga_^ o [rjgoi] '3SgF Impf from ηgu^ o [rjgo:] 'LogoSg
Impf, phonetically. Note the improbable crossing pattern, with llaoll ending up
higher than lluoll. I verified this in elicitation with two speakers, one of them
rechecked after a one-year interval. However, the (other) speakers who were taped
pronounced both as [rjgo:].
     Assuming that the immediate proto-language had five vowels, and that *e and *o
each split into open and closed phonemes in DjCh, we can make the following general
points. First, the open-closed distinction is not made in diphthongs (§3.3.1-2, below).
Second, it seems that a preceding y favored e over e, and a preceding w favored ο over
o, hence yee 'return' and woo 'this', but there are some counterexamples. Third, in
                                                                  Djenne Chiini      383longer stems, a final-syllable high vowel (i u} favors a closed e or o in preceding
syllables, as in kobi 'applaud', fombu 'crack (nuts)', jengi 'ring (Jewel)'. heku
'hiccough', and the trisyllabic kogoti 'hornbill'. A second-syllable a, on the other
hand, favors an open first-syllable ε or o, as in wemba 'be dismayed' and gooja 'chew
cud'. This correlation is not rigorous; counterexamples include neesi 'weigh'. Fourth,
in monosyllables or other stems consisting only of mid-height vowels, open ε and ο
are considerably more common (at least in native Songhay vocabulary) than closed e
ando, hence be- ben 'end', here 'flip', noo 'give', gom 'swallow', kokoro 'be last',
and kobe 'finger'. Fifth, there is a tendency toward ""harmony"" within stems, ε and ο
forming one harmonic set and e and ο the other; in addition to the examples in the
previous sentence, we have closed-vowel cases like foolo 'grain sack' and beese
'gazelle'. The second through fifth points in the list are all hedged with terms like
""favor,"" ""more common,"" and ""tendency,"" and none is exceptionless. For example, we
get too 'arrive' instead of #too and fee 'announce' instead of #fee.
     The form beer 'be big' suggests that the open-closed split occurred after the drop
of final high vowels in *CVVLi and *CVVLu stems with sonorant *L. Timbuktu
KCh has beer, and a prototype *beer would give DjCh teer by the generalization just
given. On the other hand, if the openclosed split took place before this reduction,
*beeri (KS and upriver KCh beeri) would normally have given pre-DjCh *beeri
because of the stem-final high vowel, and this would incorrectly predict modern DjCh
#beer with closed vowel after the reduction. The same argument applies to other
stems such as moor 'be distant' or 'be sour' <*mooru.
     moroo 'excrement pellets' <*morgo (KCh moroo, Zarma morgo) and its near-
homonym moroo 'smash' <*morto (KCh morro, KS motti) suggest complex
interactions between consonantal shifts (like the loss of *g and the degemination of *rr
to r), and the open-closed split.
     The harmonic tendency noted above does not apply to compounds or to
derivational suffixation. The Partpl suffix -nie generally retains its closed vowel even
after stems with open vowels, and we have a minimal pair to show this: the participle
ben^nte [bente] 'finished' differs audibly from the unanalysable bente 'good'.
Likewise, Adj suffix -o does not usually harmonize with preceding stems: moor-o
'distant', jeen-o Old'.
      In addition to the basic seven vowel qualities, DjCh has at least two loanwords
which have an [ae] vowel quality: rjkxee ~ ijkzeaen 'sardine sp.', dagwxx (and other
variants) 'antelope sp.'.","[398, 399]"

4.5 Quantificational adjectives
4.5.1 Modifying and Absolute forms of simple numeralsNumeral stems are not used as verbs. They are commonly used as modifying adjectives,
following a head noun (and any descriptive adjectives). They may also be used as NP
heads, for example in counting, in which case some of them require an overt Absolute
prefix. As modifiers or as NP heads, they may be followed by Def di and
postpositions. The simple numerals are given in (81). For ordinals, see §4.3.4.",[90]
"
4.6.7 Verb-noun compounds (-kasine, -noijgu)Compounds consisting of a verb and a following noun stem are rare, especially if we
factor out cases where the ""verb"" could be interpreted as a zero-derived nominalization
(§4.3.2). However, there are three attested nominal compounds whose second member
is -kasine 'mate, companion' and whose first member appears to be a true verb (90).
-kasine is used only as a compound final, cf. cere 'mate, peer, friend' and other lexical
choices for the simple noun.(90)          compound              gloss                            gloss of initial
              bey-kasine            'acquaintance,      friend'      'know'
              haqga-kasine          'follower, pal'                  'follow'
              maraa-kasine          'fellow resident, companion'     'assemble'     None of the compound initials is recorded independently in nominal function (for
bey the Abstr nominal is bey-rey).
     The noun noqgu 'place' can be used as a compound final with a broad range of
initials. (KS uses -doo 'place' in similar compounds.) In (91a), the initial is clearly a
noun, compare the related verbs waafaku 'agree' and waa 'defecate'. However, the
initials in (91b) are identical to intransitive or transitive verb stems, and can be
construed as true verbs or in some cases possibly as zero-derived nominalizations.(91)         compound       gloss                      gloss of initial
         a. waafak-oy-noqgu 'agreement place'          'agreement'
             wiri-norjgu    'excrement plac'           'excrement'
         b. kani-norjgu     'sleeping place'           'lie down (to sleep)'
            jiqgar-noqgu    'praying place'            'pray; prayer'
            koosu-noijgu    'abattoir'                 'slaughter'
            goy-noijgu      'workplace'                'work' [verb or noun]     The noun cere 'friend' is used (like English each other) in reciprocal constructions
('help friend' = 'help each other'). The combination of cere (in direct object function)
and a preceding verb can also be treated as a nominalized compound ('help friend' =
'mutual assistance'). For examples see the end of §10.2.6.
82 4 Nouns, pronouns, and nominal derivation4.6.8 Noun-verb compounds with verb modifying nounIn §6.3.1 we give examples of [noun-verb] compounds where the noun is an
incorporated direct object or other complement, along with suffixal or zero-derived
nominalizations of such compounds.
      There is one other [noun-verb] type where the verb is a kind of modifier, like a
participle or relative clause. This is seen in the pair har-hiiji 'married man' and
woy-hiiji'married woman'. The initials are bar 'man' and woy 'woman', and the final
is hiiji 'marry', cf. hiije ~ hiijey 'marriage'.","[97, 98]"
"
9.6.6 Bare subjunctive clauses with no overt triggerSubjunctive clauses do not seem to be used in ""indicative"" (assertive) contexts with
habitual or progressive function, as in some other Songhay languages. However, there
are quite a few textual examples where a subjunctive clause occurs in the absence of a
300 9 Sentence-level syntax and semantics""subjunctive trigger,"" that is, a complementizer or a matrix-clause verb that
specifically licenses the subjunctive mood.
     In general, such ""bare"" subjunctive clauses can be interpreted as cases where a
subjunctive trigger that could have appeared overtly is omitted (or phonetically
unrealized). However, a bare subjunctive clause may also represent a neutralization of
two or more constructions with different overt triggers. This pattern is familiar from
other languages with a subjunctive (e.g. Spanish).
     In some cases, the ""bare"" subjunctive clause is merely a simplified repetition of a
previously uttered construction involving the subjunctive and an overt trigger. This is
common when one speaker repeats another speaker's (occasionally, his or her own)
utterance, for purposes of verification or to indicate comprehension. Such echoic
repetitions are eminently characteristic of conversational structure in all societies of
this region. An example is given in (565).","[315, 316]"
"     The minimal ""small clause"" generally consists of just a NP (often a pronoun)
plus koon, and it is not immediately obvious whether this is a subject-verb, noun-
adjective, or possessor-noun sequence. However, in a case like qga koon di (397c),
Def di excludes the subject-verb reading, and the use of 3SgF qga instead of simple
3Sg a seems to argue against the possessor-noun reading, leaving noun-adjective (here:
pronoun-adjective) as the preferred analysis; see §8.4.2 on the use of ""3F"" rather than
simple third person pronouns with following modifiers. We therefore tentatively
extrapolate from (397c) and suggest the same noun-adjective analysis for e.g. (397a-b).
224     8 Discourse-functional constructions and relativizationFor the reflexive pronoun in (397a), see discussion of the same sentence as (649a) in
§10.2.4. A further example of koon is (494b) in §9.5.1.
     The basic sense of the Emph particle daa (preceding section) is 'precisely', but a
gloss Only' is appropriate in some contexts where implicature is at work, daa can be
quantitative, as in (398), as well as exclusive.(398)          joijgu     hirjka   daa      qga     goo       ay      ga
                hundred two        Emph SFoc be               ISg     on
               'Exactly (=a mere) 200 (riyals) is what I have on me.'","[239, 240]"
"
10.2.4 Syntax of reflexive pronounsIn this section we complete the analysis of the syntactic configurations requiring
reflexive pronouns. We will focus on third person constructions, since only 3Refl is
overtly distinct from corresponding nonreflexive pronouns. For first and second
persons we can imagine covert [+reflexive] marking if we wish, but no empirical issue
is involved. We consider in turn simple clauses, then conjoined NPs beginning with
(646), then adverbially juxtaposed clauses beginning with (647), then relative clauses
beginning with (650), and finally subjunctive clauses beginning with (654).
     The configuration accounting for most examples of reflexives is of the general
type (639).(639)         [s NPX - verb - ... NP, ...]
                  where the first NPX is the subject of the sentence S     We will refer to the subject NPX as the ""antecedent,"" and to the postverbal NPX as
the ""coindexed NP."" If the antecedent succeeds in ""binding"" the coindexed NP, we get
an anaphoric (3Refl) pronoun. We first consider simple cases where the coindexed NP
is not part of an embedded clause, and is not a possessor to another NP. This applies
to direct objects, objects of postpositions, and complements of prepositions like Instr-
Comit nda 'with'.
     In these syntactic functions, the coindexed NP is usually realized as a bomo
reflexive, in which case the anaphor is expressed as the 3Refl ""possessor"" of bomo
'head'. In §10.2.1, above, (630) shows instances following Instr-Comit nda (line 2 of
KCh text) and preceding Dat postposition se (line 6), while (631b-c) illustrate direct
objects, bomo is indeed normal in all of these syntactic functions.
     The less common alternative is to use simple pronouns, including 3Refl for third
person. I have no textual or elicited examples of such pronouns following nda 'with,
334     10 Anaphora, logophorics, and reported speechand'. In direct object function, we noted in the preceding section that the construction
with simple reflexive pronoun such as 3Refl occurs only with a handful of verbs for
which subject-object coreference is very common. Likewise, pronouns such as 3Refl
are used instead of homo reflexives in certain PPs where coreference to the subject NP
is expectable rather than accidental. The chief example of this is doo 'at (the place of),
chez', which occurs very often in combinations like (640) with a motion or locational
verb and with a subject NP coreferential to the complement of the postposition.(640)          i      koy [qgi-ye        doo]
               3P1S go       [3ReflPl at]
               'Theyx went to their, home.' (= 'They went home.')     One can say i koy [ggi-ye bomo doo] ""Theyx went to their, own home,' but
except in contrastive contexts this phrasing is awkward since it excessively highlights
the coreferentiality. A more idiomatic English equivalent (they went home) omits the
second pronoun entirely.
     However, if the possessor of one of these postverbal NPs is coreferential to the
subject, this possessor is regularly expressed as a simple reflexive pronoun such as
3Refl. The basic pattern is therefore X [yp Verb ... [X's Y]] for some possessed NP Y.
This applies to the bomo reflexives themselves, since they are formally possessed NPs
of the type 'X's head'. When a bomo reflexive has a third person antecedent, it takes
the form gu bomo ('3ReflSg head'), or its plural rjgi-ye bomo ('3ReflPl head'), an
example of the latter being (63 Ib) in §10.2.1. This is just a special case of a more
general pattern by which simple reflexive pronouns are strongly preferred to the more
highlighted bomo reflexives in possessor function, whether or not the Poss
postposition wane is present. Further examples are given in (641), where the
possessor is attached to a direct object (641a), a postposition (641b-c), or the
complement of preposition nda (64Id).(641)     a.   a-a           mey [[rjgu           wane] kottu yo]

participial clauses in DjCh fashion for resultative backgrounded clauses in narrative.)
Participles can be derived from numerals, from verbs of adjectival quality, from motion
and other action verbs, and in a few cases apparently from nouns.
     The ordinal type in (76a) is productive and applies to all basic numerals. The
Absolute prefix a- is used in the same way in the cardinals and ordinals for those
numerals which take this prefix. An example of an ordinal based on a complex numeral
phrase is (a-)woy^cindi-hiijka-nte 'twelfth', the -nie taking the entire phrase in its
semantic scope, lawal 'first' (<Arabic) is suppletive, cf. (a-)foo One'. However, we do
get ordinal -/bo-niein complex numerals ending in One', as in a-woyjcindi-foo-nte
'eleventh' (Absol-ten-remainder-one-Ordinal).
     (76b) shows that -nie can produce adjectives from nouns. This pattern is relatively
rare and lexically restricted. Further lexicographic study might suggest that some of
these are really deverbal (like the following sets), but of the four in (76b) only dowla
is even attested in my data as a verb, and even this stem is normally a noun.
     (76c-d) show -nie participles forming adjectives from intransitive verbs of
adjectival (i.e., involuntary and enduring) quality. Other verbs of adjectival quality form
adjectives by zero affixation (adjective = verb) or by suffixation of -o (§4.4.2). The
choice between -nie, zero, and -o is partly lexical, but there are strong hints of
phonological factors at work. The stem shape CVVC predominates in the set of stems
taking -o, for example, but no stem of this shape takes -nie and only one (beer 'big')
                                                    4.4 Morphology of adjectives         71takes zero. On the other hand, a final diphthong, a final o in the verb itself, or a
lexicalized CVCV-CVCV reduplication favors -nte over -o.
     The examples in (76e-f) mostly involve action verbs. Here the -nie participle is
generally an adjective (occasionally a verbal noun) denoting a state resulting from the
action. Semantically, the entity described by the adjectival cases is generally a patient
or theme. However, in the case of totro-nte 'bothersome, annoying, irritating' in (76g),
the participle appears to denote the agent (botherer) rather than patient (botheree).
     As noted above, ordinals in -nte take Absolute prefix a- under the same conditions
as do cardinals. Other participles in -nte can take Absol i- when the preceding noun slot
is vacant, as in i-futu-nte di 'the nasty one' (§4.4.3). This indicates that participles can
be treated as adjectives. However, certain participles can alternatively be treated as noun
stems and so dispense with ;-, as in ruf u-nie di (same meaning).","[84, 85, 86, 87]"
"     The more noun-like postpositions such as banda (as noun: 'back'; as
postposition: 'behind' or 'together with') produce PPs which are formally identical or
similar to possessed nouns: ay banda 'my back' or 'behind me'. It is more difficult to
think of these as enclitics than the shorter, high-frequency Dat and abstract spatials
shown above, and they do not consistently gravitate to immediate postverbal position.
PPs with doo 'at (the place of)' likewise show no strong enclitic tendencies.
     Instrumental-Comitative nda 'with' plus a pronominal complement can also,
arguably, be considered part of enclitic complexes. However, such forms as nda ga
'with it' follow pronominal direct objects, and typically follow simple pronominal
PPs (such as datives). In other words, pronominal nda phrases come at the end of the
enclitic sequence. When e.g. nda ga precedes a pronominal dative PP, we arc
generally not dealing with an independent Instr-Comit phrase, rather with a fused
(suffixal) -nda and its direct object pronoun (§6.2.5).
     The enclitic status of nda plus pronominal complement is also applicable to
stranded nda in cases where its complement (pronoun or full NP) has been fronted, as
in non-subject focalization (§8.1.1), WH-interrogatives (§8.2.3), and relativization
(§8.3.4).
     While only pronominals and certain pronominal adpositional phrases can be
described as actual enclitics, postverbal full NPs expressing old (and other relatively
246     9 Sentence-level syntax and semanticsaccessible) referential material also precede NPs introducing new material, as shown in
(441).(441)     a.   ay     dam     [ije       keyna     di       se]     safari
             ISgS do          [child small Def Dat] treatment

             'You again put some water in the tea-kettle.'","[261, 262]"
"     In such disjunctions of numerals, the second numeral always takes Absol form.
This is transparent in (174a-b), while iddu 'six' in (174c) has a zero Absol form
(§4.5.1). The first numeral takes the Absol prefix under the same conditions as it
would without the disjunction, thus a-hinja 'three' in (174a) but simple hinja
following a noun in (174b).
     Phrases with wala can be used in catch-all ""etcetera"" expressions, as in (175). In
this case, the denotation of the catch-all expression arguably contains that of the prior
expression(s). For wala in the emphatic sense 'even...', see §8.5.9.(175)         a        na ci      a-a           goro ka hantum
              3SgS Neg be 3SgS-Impf sit Inf write

              'It isn't (as though) he sits and writes or that kind of thing.'
                               5.11 Instrumental, comitative, and conjoined NPs         1215.11.6 Conjunction of adpositional phrasesConjunction of two postpositional phrases by nda 'and' tends to be avoided. If the two
PPs have the same postposition, it is usually easy to avoid the undesired construction
by directly conjoining the two NP complements under the scope of a single instance of
the postposition. Schematically, 'in X and in Y' is reduced to 'in [X and Y]', as
typically in English.
     However, there are of course situations where the two postpositions are distinct, in
which case we can get conjoined PPs, as in (176).(176)         kooro yo dindi       [[ay      jine]     [nda [ay            banda]]]
              hyena PI remain [[ISg in-front] [and [ISg                   behind]]]
              'There were hyenas in front of me and behind me.'","[136, 137]"
"      Note that the complement clause may denote a (known or perceived) fact, as in
(525a-b,d) or an idea for future actuation, as in (525c,e).
      The complementizer kaa is clearly distinct from the Inf[initive] morpheme ka
(§9.7), which has a short vowel and is followed by a VP rather than by a full sentence
(i.e., ka cannot be followed by a subject NP or by preverbal MAN morphemes). It is
particularly important to note this distinction in the case of bey, which takes an
indicative kaa complement in its basic lexical sense 'know (that ...)' but which takes
ka plus VP as a serial verb in the experiental-perfect sense 'have (once, ever) VP-ed'
(§9.7.5). We may also note that bey 'know', like its English counterpart, can take a
direct-object NP and can also be used intransitively, as well as taking a clausal
complement. Most of the other mental-activity verbs that permit kaa complements
can also be used as transitive verbs with NP object.
      The relationship between the complementizer kaa 'that ...' and the Rel marker
kaa is more intriguing (compare English that, which is used both as a complementizer
and as a substitute for relative which ... or who ...). Whether to equate the
complementizer to the Rel morpheme depends on decisions about how we model the
two constructions syntactically. We pointed out in §8.3, above, that kaa relative
clauses seem to hover between two syntactic structures, a predominant one in which
kaa is a relative pronoun extracted from its original site (leaving behind at most a
trace), and a secondary one favored by special factors (restarts, interference from
syntactic constraints on extraction) in which Rel kaa is a nonpronominal
complementizer that co-occurs with resumptive pronouns. To the extent that this
secondary system is productive, we could correlate the nonpronominal Rel
complementizer with the homophonous 'that ...' complementizer. Alternatively, one
could attempt to engineer a ""deep"" syntactic analysis of 'that ...' complements
whereby kaa was reanalysed as a special case of the relative pronoun, say with a
phonologically
                    9.5 Clause conjunction and indicative complement clauses             283unrealized head NP (e.g., 'she knew THE FACT that ...'). Since the verbs that take
indicative kaa complements are, in most cases, also attested as simple transitive
verbs, such an analysis is at least conceivable. However, in this grammar I will
distinguish Rel kaa from the 'that...' complementizer kaa.
     The verbs that take indicative kaa complements (at least those attested in
reasonable numbers of textual examples) may also occur without kaa, that is, with
bare indicative complements (discussed in the following section). Bare indicative
complements are attested with bey (526a) but are fairly rare. In the case of horjgu, the
indicative complement often omits the kaa (526b).(526)    a.   ma          bey     [farka      yekuwa-nte      nono]
              2SgSSubju know [donkey          be-solid-Partpl it-is]
              'You(Sg) should know it's a solid donkey.'
         b.   yer hotjgu [hew         nono]
              1P1S believe [wind it-is]
              'We thought it was wind (=a donkey disease).'","[298, 299]"
"      These examples illustrate the frequent use of jinaa as a linker between two clauses
denoting events that are strictly ordered chronologically. The construction is thus A
jinaa B where A and B represent clauses. The prosodic break (shown as a comma) can
be either before or after jinaa In the case of A jinaa, B where jinaa behaves
prosodically as a clause-final particle for A, we may translate fairly literally as Ά first,
 (then) B.' In the case of A, jinaa Β we could translate as Ά (first), then B.' The
parenthesized adverbials (first, then) can be derived inferentially in either translation. In
these constructions, jinaa closely resembles parallel uses of the Emph particle dee
(§8.5.7). However, jinaa has distinct properties under negation, where it means '(not)
yet' (§9.3.5).
      Other English quantificational adverbs are rendered in KCh by specialized serial
verbs followed by infinitival VPs. Some relevant serial verbs are filla 'repeat', yee
 'return, do again', and dooney 'be accustomed to' (§9.7.5).
      Spatiotemporal adverbials usually provide a setting (in space or time) for the
entire eventuality denoted by the sentence. They may follow the verb, be fronted
(extracted) in the nonsubject focus construction (§8.1.1), or be preposed as topic-like
constituents preceding the sentence (§8.4.1). Preposing is typical of temporal rather
than spatial adverbials; it is standard with saa di 'then, at that time, in that situation,
so', which connects the time or situation of the following sentence with that of prior
discourse. In the case of moreyda 'now', proposing is fairly common, but it tends to
follow another proposed topical constituent ('[The man] now, he came here""),
suggesting a kind of enclitic status. The primary spatial adverbials like nee 'here' and
 doodi ~ dooti 'there' generally follow the verb or, if highlighted, are focalized.
      Spatiotemporal PPs with (mainly spatial) postpositions like ga 'by, on, from', or
Loc ra or kuna, are tricky because they are often complements of verbs (of motion,
stance, etc.), as in 'they entered [into the house],' rather than stage-setters for the entire
eventuality. Their interactions with verbs are described, with many examples, in
 §11.1.
                                                        9.3 Operators and scope 253     English lexical manner adverbials, with VP scope, are generally rendered by
constructions involving two verbs, either in two separate clauses or in a serial-verb
combination. Thus 'we dig deeply into the ground' comes out in KCh as 'we dig, so
that (subjunctive) we go far under the ground,' while 'it rises rapidly' is expressed in
serial-verb form as KCh 'it hurries to arise.' There are, however, some forms that are
commonly added to VPs in the fashion of English lexical manner adverbs, notably
those in (458).(458)         form                         gloss
              mooso, mooso-mooso           'gently, slowly, delicately'
              tamba, tamba-tamba           'fast, quickly, immediately, early'   Examples of the two adverbials are (459a-b). (459c) shows that the negation of
tamba is the common way to translate '(come, be) late'.(459)    a.   nda     ni        waay         [nda     ga]     tamba
              if      2SgS be-aware          [with 3SgO] fast

              3SgS-Impf      crawl Rdp-slow
              'He crawls slowly.'
         c.   a       na       kaa        tamba
              3SgS Neg         come fast
              'He came late.' (lit., 'He didn't come early.')     tamba can also be used as a verb 'hurry, do fast, go fast', and can therefore occur
in imperatives like (460a). mooso, on the other hand, remains adverbial in the sense
'do slowly' and combines with the ""light"" verb dam 'do', as in (460b).(460)    a.   wo            tamba
              2PlImpera do-fast
              'You(Pl) do it quickly!' (imperative)

              2PlImpera do           slow
              'You(Pl) do it slowly (gently)!' (imperative)      Subject-oriented adverbials resemble manner adverbials in their syntactic position,
but have a specific semantic relationship to the subject NP. KCh appears to lack
lexical subject-oriented adverbials (On purpose', 'carefully'). On purpose' is expressed
not by an adverbial, rather by a serial-verb construction, as in (461), which could be
literally glossed as e.g. 'she meant to hit me' but which has a stronger implication
that the intended action was carried out.(461)         a        murey           ka         kar     ey
              3SgS     do-on-purpose Inf          hit     ISgO
              'She hit me on purpose.'
254     9 Sentence-level syntax and semantics     Instrumental-comitative phrases consisting of nda 'with, and' and a following NP
(§5.11.3-4) function in some cases as subject-oriented adverbials, in other cases as
manner (VP-oriented) adverbials, in still others as regular complements of particular
verbs (§6.1.6). In (462a), the associates (even though inanimate) are strongly
connected with the agent-subject, hence a paraphrase like '[You and they (=tools)] will
go and work.' Instrumental phrases like that in (462b) are a little harder to massage
into a similar paraphrase, but the instrument (here 'limestone' as a building material)
is a necessary link between the agent and the denoted activity ('build it'). On the other
hand, idiomatic phrases with nda like 'by its road' (= 'properly') in (462c) are best
described as manner adverbials, and in this particular case the 3Sg pronoun possessor

3.8.5 Plural yo before postpositions and other particlesThe nominal PI morpheme is pronounced yo in isolation or in other phrase-final
position. It is also yo when immediately followed by the quantifier kul 'all', as in
boro di yo kul 'all the people'.
      However, in some other combinations the yo is usually unrounded to ye ~ ya. (It
is difficult to distinguish a from e after y in unstressed grammatical morphemes.) This
unrounding is normal before Dat and spatial postpositions se, ra, kuna, and doo.
Examples: boro di ye ra 'in the people', boro di ye se 'for the people' (dative).
Note that the quality of the postposition vowel seems to play no role here; the process
is best seen as a relaxation of the secondary labial articulation, influenced both by the
preceding palatoalveolar y and by the lack of phonetic stress in these positions. It
appears that phrase-final (and especially prepausal) position is too ""exposed"" to permit
this relaxation.
      The unrounding can also occur when the plural noun is followed without pause by
another grammatical morpheme such as Rel kaa and SFoc nga. Thus boro di ya kaa
... 'the people who ...', boro di ya nga kar ga 'it was the people [focus] who hit
him.'
      A similar unrounding is very common in the 3P1F pronoun rjgi-yo and the
(sometimes homophonous) Logo/3ReflPl pronoun ngu-yo~ ngi-yo (see §4.1.4). The
rounded vowel is heard phrase-finally, as in the logophoric example i har [ay kar
ngi-yo] 'theyxy said that [I hit themxy].' Such phrase-final position is possible when the
pronoun in question is a simple direct object, or when it occurs in isolation. In all
other uses (subject, focused NP, dative or other postpositional object, possessor) the
pronoun is immediately followed by other material. In this situation, at least in
Timbuktu KCh, the -yo tends strongly to be pronounced [ja] (or [je], the two being
hard to discriminate in rapid speech). A possessor example is ngi-ya harme di 'their
(LogoPl or 3ReflPl) brother'.",[60]
"
5.6 Definite diThe Def morpheme is di. It follows the lexical material (noun, adjective), numerals,
and Dem in a full NP, but precedes PI yo, discourse-function markers, and
postpositions. Its functions resemble those of the English definite article, except that it
can be used after demonstrative woo in woo di 'that'. Examples in (125).

              'for the two black persons'     Def frequently co-occurs with Dem woo (examples in §5.5), but cannot be added
directly to personal pronouns: #ni di 'you', tiqga di 'she'. Forijga woo di, see §5.5.
     KCh di has a much broader grammatical range than those of its cognates, KS din
and HS di. KS and HS have a distinct suffixal definite category, to which di(n) may be
added as a stronger discourse-anaphoric marker. Consider now (126).(126)         moreyda     [alhoor      di]    muso        foo       na

    With preceding woo cinne 'that sort' we get quantified expressions like woo
oinne hirjka 'two like that, two of that type'.
    The forms for 'twenty' and 'thirty', though not synchronically analysable, share an
onset wara..., and end with the final segments of 'two' and 'three', respectively. For
                                                    4.5 Quantificational adjectives    75'thirty' through 'ninety', and for numerals like 'thirteen' and 'fifty-seven', see the
following section.
     a- is the regular nonzero Absol prefix in true numerals, versus i- with ordinary
adjectives: a-woy 'ten'. Note that foo forms a-foo as numeral One', but i-foo as
interrogative 'which (one)?'. The only other alternation of Absolute a- and i- in
Timbuktu is a-kul 'all (of it)' versus i-kul 'all (of them)' (discussed in detail in
§5.4.3). In expressions like 'two or three Xs' for some noun X, the first numeral is
non-absolute since it is directly attached to the modified noun X, but the second
numeral has the Absol prefix. It seems best to bracket such phrases as in (82).(82)          [keydiya           hiqka]     [wala      a-hinja]
              [wet-season        two]       [or        Absol-three]
              'two or three wet seasons'      Several numerals have zero Absol prefix; alternatively, we could say that they do
not allow this prefix. The numerals from One' to 'ten' which have no overt Absol
prefix are '6, 7, 8, 9'. These happen to be the numerals with stem-initial i or y, so
there is a possible phonological characterization of this set, but the fact that these four
constitute a consecutive sequence in counting may also be significant. Other numerals
lacking an overt Absol prefix are 'hundred' and 'thousand', but in these cases the
explanation may be that they are syntactic nouns rather than adjective-like numerals.
Like ordinary nouns, 'hundred' and 'thousand' are themselves commonly quantified over
('five hundred', 'three thousand'). Finally, the suppletive ordinal lawal 'first' does not
take an overt Absol prefix: lawal di 'the first one'.
     Very large numbers are expressed using French terms (million 'million', milliard
'billion, thousand million').
     In §4.4.3 we noted that 3Sg a and 3P1 i as possessors are phonologically awkward
before ordinary adjectives beginning with Absol a-. The same awkwardness is observed
when these pronouns occur as possessors before numerals (e.g., ordinals) beginning
with Absol a -. Once again, the usual pattern is to include Poss wane, as in a wane^
a-hirjka-nte di 'her second one', or a ""3F' (Full third person) pronoun as possessor, as
mgga^a-hiqka-nte d/(same gloss). There is no difficulty with other pronouns, hence
ay a-hiijka-nte di 'my second one'.
       boro 'person* is sometimes used as a kind of numeral classifier between a
quantified noun and a numeral. See §5.4.8 for some of the nuances when the quantified
element is a pronoun.","[90, 91]"
"       However, a preposed topical NP does not require such a ""resumptive"" pronoun.
                           2. l Brief outline of typical sentence and NP structures    13     Occasionally a NP with topic marking is treated as part of the sentence proper,
namely as its subject NP. In this case, the MAN morphemes and the VP immediately
follow the topic-marked subject NP.
     While topic-marked NPs are generally sentence-external, focalized NPs are clearly
part of sentential syntax even though the focused NP (or PP) is always fronted
(=extracted). (We use ""preposed"" or in connection with sentence-external elements such
as most topic-marked NPs, ""fronted"" or ""extracted"" for sentence-internal movement
associated with focalization, WH-interrogatives, and perhaps relativization). In KCh,
unlike KS, extraction normally leaves behind a phonologically zero trace (rather than a
resumptive pronoun).
     The focalization system sharply distinguishes subject focus from other focus
structures. If the grammatical subject is the focus, the morpheme rjga occurs between
subject NP and the remainder of the sentence (16).(16)          ay        qga      guna      ga
              ISg       SFoc     see        3SgO
              Ί [focus] saw him (her).' (= 'It was I [no-one else] who saw ...')    Without the SFoc morpheme, there would be no way to tell that the subject has
been focalized, since subjects precede MAN morphemes and VPs. SFoc ijga is
phonologically identical with a ""Full"" (nonclitic) 3Sg pronoun which we label
""3SgF."" This raises the possibility of construing SFoc .rjga as a kind of subject
resumptive pronoun: the subject NP, here ay (ISg), is shifted to the left, out of the
subject position into a special focus slot, whereby a type of 3Sg subject pronoun
appears in the true subject position. However, this analysis is only one of the
possibilities to be explored later, and it is problematic for the upriver dialects.
    For non-subject focus, the normal KCh construction is to front (extract) the
focused constituent, adding Focus morpheme na before the subject NP. This pattern is
especially common in WH questions and responses to such questions (17).(17)         maa           na    no-o              taasi?
             what?         Foe 2SgS-Impf           seek
             'What [focus] are you seeking (=doing here)?'","[28, 29]"
