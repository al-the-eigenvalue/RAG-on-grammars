134                             5- 2 Dyirbal as a nominative-ergative language
in. It appears that an interrogative form does not usually function, by itself, as
the topic for a series of sentences.
   We thus have a general rule: irrespective of realisational identities
or differences, the unmarked syntactic identification between simple
sentences is always of an S NP with an O NP (or S with S, or O with O)
and NEVER of an S or O NP with an A NP. To identify an S or O NP
with an A N P - a s in (421), (429), (431), (422), (433) - particular
marked syntactic means (a favourite or a -yura construction) have to
be employed.
   This rule was in fact anticipated in the summary (4.5.6) of ways of
generating a discourse from types of sentence-pairs - these ways do
NOT depend on whether the NPs involved are nominal, pronominal or
pronominal interrogative.
   From our discussion above it thus appears coincidental that identical
forms mark functions S and A in the case of all pronouns in D and M,
and for non-singular pronouns in G. The case inflections of pronouns
are discussed and explained in 5.8.2.
There is one respect in which pronouns seem to have slightly wider syntactic
possibilities than nouns. We mentioned in 4.5.2 that an SA pronoun can run
through a sequence of intransitive simple sentences, and also through a sequence
of transitive simple sentences - as in (117-18). That is, we can identify an A
pronominal NP in one sentence with an A pronominal NP in the next (but, as
mentioned above, we cannot directly identify O or S with A, or vice versa).
However, we can also have a -rjay plus -yura construction joining two pro-
nominal A NPs, as in (153), or else a 'planning ahead' construction, similar to
(160).
  It should be noted that utterances have been observed that appear to involve
an A NP, whose head noun is in ergative case, joining two sentences, as:
(446) bala yugu baygul yaxarjgu nudinjbayi jtalrjga bund,un tree was cut by
      man, and child was spanked [by man]
However, this can be accounted for by saying that (446) involves two quite
 separate sentences, but that the actor is left 'unspecified' (cf. 4.5.1) in bayi
jialyga bund,un ' the child was spanked'; in this case the unmarked interpretation
would be likely to be that 'the man', who is the actor of bala yugu baygul
yaxarjgu nudin, is also the actor for bayi jtalrjga bund,un. Sequences such as
 (446) have been encountered relatively infrequently. However, sentences -
like (117-18)-joined by rja^a are much more frequent and it may be in-
appropriate to account for them in the same way. Note also that in the ' norm'
word order, a non-pronominal NP in ergative inflection comes after any (nomi-
native) topic NP; but an NP involving a pronoun in SA form - whether it
marks function S or A in this particular instance - will precede any other NP
(7.8).
5-2   Dyirbal as a nominative-ergative language                                     135   We began by noticing that, very much as in the case of Hidatsa,
Dyirbal appeared on the surface to be a language of mixed syntactic
type, and to constitute an exception to the hypothesis that all languages
are either strictly nominative-accusative or strictly nominative-ergative.
Matthews showed that in Hidatsa the underlying syntactic pattern was
nominative-accusative, the apparent ergativity being explainable in
terms of a general causative relation. We have shown the opposite for
Dyirbal - that the underlying syntax is nominative-ergative, with the
apparent accusative nature being the result of special rules for assigning
pronominal inflections (5.8.2). Thus, in each case, detailed investigation
of apparent exceptions shows that these languages do, in fact, conform
to the universal hypothesis.
   It was mentioned, in 1.4, that the majority of Australian languages
have nouns inflecting in a nominative-ergative pattern, and pronouns
following a nominative-accusative paradigm, as in Dyirbal. It is likely
that it will be possible to show, by methods similar to those used for
Dyirbal, that in each case the underlying syntax is of the nominative-
ergative type. It is interesting to note that some languages (for example,
Walbiri) have both pronouns and nouns inflecting in a nominative-
ergative pattern.
It is something of an oversimplification to say that pronouns often follow
a nominative-accusative pattern. In G, for instance, singular pronouns have
different forms for each of the three basic syntactic functions, S, A and O;
a similar situation prevails in most languages of the eastern seaboard, and for
some elsewhere. And in Pittapitta [Roth, 1897], for instance, pronouns show
different forms for S, A and O in all persons and numbers. It would be more
accurate to say that pronouns often appear on the surface NOT to follow a
nominative-ergative pattern, but DO follow such a pattern in their syntactic
behaviour.
   There are, according to Hale [1970] two groups of languages in which both
pronouns and nouns inflect in a nominative-accusative way: one in the north-
west, and one centred on the Wellesley Islands in the Gulf of Carpentaria.
Hale mentions [1970: 759] that 'it is possible to show that the northwestern
languages are only superficially accusative, that they have developed an accusa-
tive system of case marking. . .in quite recent times'.
   The best-known representative of the Wellesley Islands group of languages
is Lardil. Lardil shows many divergences from the common Australian pattern,
sketched in chapter 1, and it is clear that if it is related toother Australian languages
(as does in fact seem likely) then it has undergone some rather sweeping syntactic
and other changes. It is quite natural to suppose that these have included changes
that altered the inflectional system from a nominative-ergative to a nominative-
accusative type. It is interesting to note that the object of an imperative
sentence is, if a noun, in nominative case (which is the case used to mark
136                              5- 2 Dyirbal as a nominative-ergative language
transitive and intransitive subject, in non-imperative sentences) and not
accusative (which is the case a transitive object must be in, in a non-imperative
sentence). Imperative constructions typically preserve archaic patterns (Whit-
ney, 1889: 215; Watkins, 1963, 1970; Kurytowicz, 1964: 137), and the fact that
Lardil imperatives have nominative-ergative overtones suggests that Lardil
may have evolved from a language that was of the nominative-ergative type.
However, a great deal of descriptive and historical work would have to be
done in order to confirm or disprove this hypothesis.
   There is thus a good deal of evidence SUGGESTING that pro to-Australian
(the postulated ancestor language from which all modern languages are
descended) had a nominative-ergative type syntax.
   Hale [1970] has, somewhat surprisingly, postulated that pro to-Australian
was of the nominative-accusative type. He is thus suggesting that Lardil and
the two or three other languages in the Wellesley Islands group, that have
undergone a number of drastic changes of various sorts, retain the original
syntactic pattern; and that the two hundred or so other Australian languages,
that have probably undergone considerably milder changes of other sorts,
have completely changed their syntactic type. As we have already mentioned,
Hale believes that the north-western group of nominative-accusative languages
have developed an accusative system rather recently; he must thus be suggesting
that this group evolved from an ancestor that was of nominative-accusative
type, through some intermediate stages in which the syntactic pattern was
nominative-ergative.
   A full discussion of Hale's proposals, which were meant to be quite tentative
and suggestive, would be out of place here. We will, however, mention two
fundamental points on which his discussion is misleading:
   [1] Hale states that nominative-accusative languages ALWAYS have a voice
distinction (i.e. a passive transformation), whereas nominative-ergative languages
NEVER do. In fact, having discounted the north-western languages, he is dealing
with a single group of * true accusative languages' - Lardil and its neighbours
- which do have a distinction of voice. He fails to mention that Dyirbal has,
through the -tjay transformation, a voice distinction; the same is true of
Wargamay, to the south of Dyirbal (and see 4.4.2).
   [2] Largely to explain this correlation between case and voice, Hale suggests
that ergative languages have an underlying accusative structure, but that
their transitive sentences are obligatorily in passive form. As evidence to
support this suggestion Hale implies that the ergative inflection in ergative
languages is frequently cognate with the inflection on the passive agent in
accusative languages. In fact, Hale illustrates his discussion with ' artificial
examples, using reconstructible morphemes' - that is, the examples are not
sentences in any known Australian language. Uncontroversially, he uses -pgu
for the ergative inflection (cf. 1.6). He also uses -tjgu for passive agent in
sentences said to be typical of accusative languages, and mentions that 'the
striking similarity between passive and ergative surface structures is, of course,
exaggerated in the artificial examples because I have used phonologically
identical suffixes to represent the ergative ending in B and the agentive ending
in A. However, this is not totally devoid of historical reality - in some Australian
accusative languages, e.g. Kurama-Yintjipanti of the Northwest, the agentive
5.2   Byirbal as a nominative-ergative language                             137ending in passives is clearly descended from *-ygu~-lu, which is the pre-
dominant source for the ergative inflection' [1970: 761]. But this is irrelevant,
since Hale has already stated that Kurama-Yintjipanti have changed from
ergative to accusative type in quite recent times. It is surely only relevant
to consider passive agentive inflection in languages of the Wellesley Islands
group. In Lardil this inflection is, in non-future sentences, identical to the
genitive inflection, i.e. -rjan~-kan\ and in future sentences, it is identical to
the non-future accusative i.e. -n~-in (Hale 1970: 777 and private communi-
cation). It is thus not remotely similar to the common ergative inflections
-ygu and -lu.","[157, 158, 159, 160, 161]"
"4.1.2 Involving pronouns: nominative-accusative construction.
However, simple sentences (in D and M) involving pronouns exhibit
a different type of construction:
                                     [59]
60                                                     4-1   Simple sentences(28) yad,a banipu I'm coming
(29) yinda banipu You're coming
(30) rjadja yinuna balgan I'm hitting you
(31) yinda yayguna balgan You're hitting me
These sentences exhibit a typical nominative-accusative construction,
suggesting - on the basis solely of (28-31), taking no account of (24-7)
- that forms yacj^a and yinda be named 'nominative', and forms yayguna
and yinuna 'accusative'.
Only in D and M simple sentences involving pronouns can the ' nominative-
accusative' construction be recognised. In G the singular pronouns have
different case inflections for all three syntactic functions.
   The majority of Australian languages behave exactly like Dyirbal, with
nouns following a nominative-ergative pattern and pronouns (superficially at
least) a nominative-accusative pattern - see 1.4.
   In 5.2.2 we give syntactic reasons suggesting that pronouns, like
nouns, follow an underlying nominative-ergative pattern. Throughout
the grammar 'nominative' is used to mean a case in a nominative-
ergative system (that is, referring to transitive object and intransitive
subject); we do not recognise an 'accusative' case for Dyirbal.
  Sentences can mix nouns and pronouns quite freely, without any
possibility of ambiguity. Thus:
(32) yaa]a bayi ya^a balgan I am hitting man
(33) yayguna baygul yayaygu balgan Man is hitting me
4.2 Noun phrases
4.2.1 Non-pronominal noun phrases. If it does not contain a
pronoun, a N[oun] P[hrase] will as a rule contain a noun and noun
marker, and can also contain any number of adjectives (although in
texts few NPs involve more than one adjective). The marker most often
precedes and adjectives follow the noun. However, it is perfectly normal
for NPs in Dyirbal to contain only a marker, or only a noun, or only
an adjective, or else just noun and adjective, or marker and adjective.
If there is no noun the unmarked reference of a class I marker will be
to a man or men, and of a class II marker to a woman or women (but
a class II marker without a noun might, in a suitably marked situational
context, refer to a turtle say, or the sun; and so on):
(34) bayi banipu [man] is coming
4'2 Noun phrases                                                             61(35) bulgan bani/iu big [something] is coming
(36) bayi bulgan banijiu big [man] is coming
(37) bayi ya^a bulgan banijiu big man is comingSentences such as (34-6) occur freely in Dyirbal speech. However, informants
- while agreeing that such sentences were used - insisted that (37) was more
correct than (35) and (36). This suggests that a noun and noun marker should
be taken to underlie every non-pronominal NP, forms (34-36) being accounted
for in terms of * discourse ellipsis \
   Superficially at least, noun and adjective appear to have:
   [1] the same syntactic possibilities - each can be the only word in an
NP; each can be verbalised in the same ways (4.7.1); and so on.
   [2] the same inflectional morphology.
They can best be distinguished in terms of surface grammar on the
grounds that an adjective can usually occur in an NP with a noun
marker belonging to any of the four classes, whereas a noun is limited
to occurrence with markers of just one class (or at most two-3.2.2).
Noun and adjective can also be distinguished semantically.
   Dyirbal distinguishes between what we can call * alienable' and
'inalienable' possession. Alienable possession (including kinship
relation) is shown through genitive inflection of the words of the
possessor NP-4.11. Inalienable possession is shown simply by apposition.
   In addition to a head noun, usually accompanied by a marker showing
its class, an NP can contain a second 'modifier' noun that cannot be
accompanied by a marker. In this case the referent of the modifying
noun is inalienably possessed by the referent of the head (as being
'a part of it). Both nouns take case inflection appropriate to the
syntactic function of the NP :
(38) bala mambu baygul yayaygu balgan man is hitting a back
(39) balan djugumbil mambu barjgul yapaygu balgan man is hitting
      woman's back
Dyirbal discourse is extraordinarily elliptical, and it would be perfectly normal
to omit Qugunibil from (39), producing:
(40) balan mambu Bangui yaxangu balgan man is hitting her back
In (40) balan is the sole realisation of the NP head, mambu being a non-head
modifying noun. (40) can be distinguished from (38) - which involves no state-
ment of inalienable possession, and in which mambu is the head of its NP -
through the different noun markers; (38) involves a class IV marker, correspond-
ing to mambu, whereas (40) involves a class II marker, corresponding to the
omitted possessor noun.
62                                                       4-2 Noun phrases   Only in the case of inalienable possession can a Dyirbal NP contain
two nouns, without any affixes besides case inflection. In particular, it
is impossible to have an NP such as:
#
    (4i) bayi yapa balan djUgumbil banijiu [man and woman are coming]
One would either have to subordinate one participant by suffixing noun
and marker with -bila 'with' (6.1.1):
(42) bayi yaya balanambila ^ugumbilbila banijiu man is coming with
      woman
Or else use the affix -gara 'one of a pair' (6.1.1), which should be
affixed to both nouns:
(43) bayiya^agara balan d,ugumbilgara banijiu man, being one of a pair,
      and woman, being the other of the pair, are coming
~gara> in one of its functions, can thus be regarded as a phrasal co-
ordinator (-gara is used when there are two NPs to be coordinated,
-maygan when there are more than two).
Dyirbal has a number of lexical and grammatical devices for referring to two
people, depending on their kinship relation - for instance, yaybir 'man and
wife', and see the discussion of -4ir and related affixes in 6.1.3. Sentences
such as (42) and (43) seldom need to be used; on hearing such a sentence a
Dyirbalrjan would be likely to infer that the man and woman had no right
to be together, and were doing something quite illicit.
 A Dyirbal sentence can contain both an ergative NP and an instru-
mental NP:
(44) balan djUgumbil baygul yapaygu baygu yuguygu balgan            man is
      hitting woman with stick
By discourse ellipsis, either or both words in the ergative and/or the
instrumental NP may be omitted. Thus one might hear:
(45) balan d/ugumbil baygul yuguygu balgan he is hitting woman with
       stick
Since ergative and instrumental inflections are identical, it might be
thought that baygul qualified yuguygu in (45). That they do in fact
belong to different NPs is evident from an examination of noun class -
yugu is class IV whereas baygul is a class I marker, obviously referring
to a deleted agent noun.
  Ergative and instrumental NPs behave differently in a number of
ways - for instance, the -yay transformation changes the case of an
ergative NP, but leaves an instrumental untouched - 4.9.1.
^.2   Noun phrases                                                   634.2.2 Pronominal noun phrases. An NP can contain a pronoun,
instead of noun-plus-marker, as head; the rest of the phrase can then
be as described above. For instance, inalienable possession:
(46) yayguna mambu baygul yayaygu balgan man is hitting my back
  Dual and plural first person pronouns are not marked as inclusive
or exclusive. The dual first person pronoun can be accompanied by
a second person singular pronoun (to show inclusion) or a noun-plus-
marker (to show exclusion):(47) yali yinda banijtu you and I are coming
(48) yali bayi yaya banijiu man and I are coming
Similarly in the case of the first person plural pronoun.
  A pronominal NP can also contain a noun marker. For instance (see
4.16 for the interrogative clitic -ma):
(49) yindama bayi banijtu did you come ?
A reply to (49) would be likely to involve the demonstrative marker
giyi:
(50) yad,a giyi banijiu Fm the one that came.
giyi qualifies yac^a in (50); note that it can also qualify yayguna, in a
transitive object NP:
(51) yayguna giyi baygulya^aygu balgan I'm the one the man is hitting
  A pronominal NP can also involve a noun in addition to a marker:
(52) yindajbayiyayajbani you, man, come here!
   A pronoun can be qualified by an adjective. For instance, within
a transitive subject NP:
(53) yinda wuygiygujbam             miraji babi
     you-Aold-ERG THERE-NOM-III bean-NOM peel-iMP
     you, old [person], slice the beans!
In text xxv, line 87 (p. 394) there occurs an NP involving a pronoun, a
noun marker, and an adjective - yindama bayi gard,a 'are you alright?'.
   These examples lead us to conclude that a pronominal NP has all
the possibilities of a non-pronominal NP, together with the inclusion
of one or two pronouns.
64                                                     4'2   Noun phrases   We have so far dealt with NPs involving two nominal cases - nomina-
tive and ergative; and (leaving aside G) two pronominal cases, which
we can call SA (yarfa, yinda, yali, etc.) and O (yayguna, yinuna, yalina,
etc.). These co-occur within an NP as follows:        NP        noun, adjectives    pronouns
       with      and noun markers       are in
     function:      are in case:        case:           examples
        S           nominative           SA            (48-50, 52)
        A           ergative             SA            (53)
        O           nominative           O             (46, 51)4.3 Verb complexes
Each verb or adverbal root has a fixed transitivity. There are derivational
affixes that change transitivity - for instance, a transitive root (say,
buybal 'hide'), plus reflexive yields an intransitive stem {buybayiriy
'hide oneself'); similarly, an intransitive root (baniy 'come') plus the
comitative affix, yields a transitive stem (banimal 'bring'). We use the
term 'surface transitivity' to refer to the transitivity of a stem, after
all derivational processes have applied.
   A simple sentence can be analysed into a nominative NP (that is, the
topic-4.4.3, 4.5.2) and a V[erb] Pfhrase]. If the sentence is transitive,
the VP will consist of an ergative NP and a transitive V[erb] C[omplex];
if intransitive, the VP will be just an intransitive VC.
   A VC can contain any number of verbs or adverbals, provided that:
[1] they agree in surface transitivity; and [2] they agree in tense or
other final inflection (6.3.1). Thus in M, for example (wayjidjil is an
intransitive root 'motion upwards, other than upriver'):
(54) balan maraba warijiu birds are flying
(55) balan maraba warijtu wayjidjin birds are flying up
VCs can also contain verb markers and/or locational nominals, subject
to certain selectional restrictions (3.4.6). Thus:
(56) bayi yaya jdnayiu balay man sat there
(57) bayi yaia jiinajm dibanda man sat on (or by) stone
(58) bayi yaya jdnajiu balay dibanda man sat there on (or by) stone
(59) bayiyapa jiinajiu balay dibanda bulganda man sat there on (or by)
     big stone
4.3 Verb complexes                                                             65Sentences such as:
(60) bayi yaxa pinajtu balay bulganda man sat there on (or by) big [thing]
also occur; however these are, on informants' testimonies, elliptical versions
of * correct' sentences such as (59). That is, in underlying structure an adjective
always qualifies a noun - see comments in 4.2.1.","[83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89]"
"6.1.5 Case inflections. Case inflections can be added to any nominal
stem - a full paradigm was given in 3.2.1. With a few exceptions
(-bu, -ru, -bi- 6.7; -q*an(a) - 6.1.6) nothing can follow a case inflection
within the same word. Sentence clitics (-ma, -riga, -gira -4.16) are
enclitic to the first word of a sentence, whatever it is or whatever its
inflection.
   Dative and allative are both realised by -gu in the case of nouns.
There are, however, a number of syntactic differences between the
two case forms:
   [1] a noun-plus-^*/ will be accompanied by a dative noun marker
(baguly bagun, bagum or bagu) if it is in dative case; and by an allative
verb marker (balu or ball) if the -gu marks allative case.
   [2] a dative, but not an allative, noun can be qualified by a relative
        clause.
   [3] a dative, but not an allative, noun can be the basis for a favourite
       construction.
   [4] an allative, but not a dative, noun can be verbalised.
   [5] an allative, but not a dative, noun can be augmented by affix -ru
       (3-4-6).
In most instances there is sufficient information WITHIN a sentence to tell
whether a -gu form is dative or allative; in case of doubt the ambiguity can be
resolved by asking the informant whether the form could be verbalised, or
qualified by a relative clause, and so on.
  Semantically, dative -gu and allative -gu are fairly distinct (translation into
English, where they can both be rendered by 'to', tends to obscure this).
There is, however, an ELEMENT of common meaning between allative and
dative in Dyirbal, as in other languages. Further general discussion of this
point would be outside the scope of the present work.
   The ablative case, and the stem-forming nominal affix ' out of - ,
from - ' have the same realisation: -yunu. These are semantically similar
but differ functionally: the nominal affix can be followed by a case
inflection, whereas the ablative case inflection must be word-final; a
nominal plus stem-forming affix -yunu behaves like an adjective,
modifying the head noun in an NP, whereas a nominal in ablative case
provides locational qualification for the head noun in a VP, agreeing
with the verb marker in locational choice (i.e. co-occurring only with
verb markers bayum, yayum). Informants gave sentences (547-8) and:
6.1   Morphology of nouns and adjectives                                237(597) bayi        mulmajiu       jbalugali           jbanagu   \

      hole [e.g. a man that had fallen into a hole and had to be pulled
      out again]
It appears impossible to have a word involving two -rjunu's - a stem-forming
affix followed by ablative inflection. Thus informants rejected:
*(599) Va4a banijiu bayum ya^ayunu yitjarirjunutjunu
in favour of:
(600) r)ad,a banijiu barjum yatayunu yiyaribaravunu    I'm coming from man
      from hole   Although the simple genitive cases in Dyirbal have some semantic
similarities with genitive and dative cases set up for other languages
(for example, Latin) there are significant differences. For example,
wugal 'give' typically occurs in a proleptic construction; that is, the
giver will be in the ergative case, that which is given in the nominative
case, and the recipient in the simple genitive case, as a possessive
phrase qualifying that which is given:
(601) balam miraji bayun a]ugumbilyu baygul yapaygu wugan man gave
      woman beans
literally * man gave beans, which belong to woman [understood: beans
are given to person to whom they belong]'. This kind of construction
is consistent with the Dyirbalnan's belief that something must belong
'by right'; there is very little spontaneous non-necessary giving, but
a great deal of necessary giving, according to the people's habits of
sharing most things with their relatives etc. - 2.4. A full account of the
considerable syntactic possibilities of wugan is in 8.2.3.
   The locative case has, in addition to its central use as an indicator
of position, the following uses:
   [1] when something is done because of X, X can receive locative
inflection. There is very frequently an element of fear involved here:
what is done may be done to avoid contact with X. For example
(text xv, lines 24 and 36, pp. 373-4):
238                                 6.1   Morphology of nouns and adjectives(602) giyipaygadayi yali buybarigu let us hide ourselves away from him
(603) yuiay yali jiina\bayuldjinda we must sit quietly, because of that
      which belongs to him (i.e. so that we do not become involved
      with it)
A locative inflection of this type can go on to:
  either [a] a noun marker plus -jia, e.g. bayipayga 'for fear of him
             there', yayijiayga 'for fear of him here'
      or [b] a noun marker in genitive inflection, e.g. bayuldjinda,
             yayuld/inda
      or [c] a noun in genitive inflection, e.g. djUmbuluyujtdjinda
However, it cannot go on to a simple noun root, or a noun root plus
-pa; thus (qua this sense) *djUmbuluga> *q]umbulujiayga.
  Forms of type [c] can co-occur with type [a] or with type [b]:
(604) galga yanum bayipayga djUmbuluyupdjinda don't go for fear of
      Dyumbulu
(605) galga yanum bayuldjinda djumbuluyupa]inda ( = (604))
  A locative in sense [1] can involve a relative clause:
(606) yalidji buybayiri bayijiayga baniyura hide for fear of him that
      has [/may] come
Note that the verb inflection -bila (4.13.1) can occur with dative but
not with locative inflection.
   Further examples are in text xxxib, lines 1 and 2 (p. 383).
   [2] locative inflection is used in some cases when (on the basis of
English 'to') dative might be expected; that is, locative marks certain
'objects' of adjectives etc. Thus a]ilbay means 'know how to do some-
thing, e.g. used to the job'; it can also mean 'know a certain person,
i.e. familiar with their ways and habits', as in:
(607) bayi djilbaybin yaygua]inda he's used to me (say, he knows he
      can treat my place like home, and help himself to my food, etc.)
  [3] locative can also mean ' amongst -, of - ' :
(608) bayi midid,aran bulayi ya%ayga bulgangayd,a they are the smallest
      two of the men [literally, they are two small amongst big(ger)
      men]
  [4] when talking about language activity, the name of a language or
6.i   Morphology of nouns and adjectives                                  239style of speech (e.g.guwal, a]alyuy) may be in locative case, e.g. giramay q]a
'in Giramay', djirbaja 'in Dyirbal':(609) yinda wurba giramayq]a you talk in Giramay!or wiyaman d,alyuyq\a 'how is it done (i.e. said) in Dyalquy?'.
  Note that an alternative to (609) is:(610) yinda giramay wurba      you talk Giramay!where the noun referring to 'language' is in the topic NP (here yinda
giramay should perhaps be regarded as an instance of inalienable
possession).
   [5] locative is the only case inflection that can occur with D M
yimba, G may a 'nothing'; thus yimbayga 'concerning nothing*-see
(351) and 4.17.6.1.6 -<£ana> 'ban. Affixes -q]ana and -ban can be placed at the end
of various types of words; they do not appear to have any clear cognitive
meaning, nor any very fixed or strong syntactic function.
   -a]ana can be affixed to noun markers, demonstrative markers, pro-
nouns and time qualifiers. It draws attention to a certain person or
thing: 'this is the one'.
(611) yindadjana yayguna yuna\ajiu you're the one that blamed me
(612) yaygunadjana yinda yuna]ajiu I'm the one you blamed
One use of -d,ana is in replying to a question about some earlier sentence
that was not clearly understood. Thus, if a speaker said:
(613) gilu yaa]a yanuji   I'll go later on today
but the addressee, not hearing clearly, asked:
(614) mijiay   when?
the speaker would be likely to say:
(615) giludjana yad,a yanujt
emphasising the gilu by means of -d,ana.
  -djOna cannot normally be affixed to more than one word in an NP
(or, for that matter, in a sentence). Thus we can say bayind,ana ya^a
duygarajiu 'man cried' or bayiyapacfana duygarajiu but not ^bayincfana
           duygarajiu.
240                                   6.1     Morphology of nouns and adjectives   -d,ana is sometimes shortened to -q]an in discourse - see (555). The
common imperative particle form gadjidjOn (4.15.1) probably involves
this affix.
   -ban can be affixed to (at least) noun markers, predominantly in
M, and provides a degree of emphasis. Thus DM bayimbany G bayinban
is a more emphatic form than bayi. -ban also occurs with interjections,
e.g. yimbaban, mayaban, mayadjiluban - see 4.17.","[260, 261, 262, 263, 264]"

1.6 Noun and adjective
In the great majority of Australian languages noun and adjective inflect
in the same way for case. There is typically a system of from about
four to eight cases.
The few languages that lack case inflections are all in or near Arnhem Land: for
instance, Gunwinggu [Oates, 1964], Maung, Nunggubuyu. In most of these
languages verb prefixes provide some identification of subject and object.
   In most languages intransitive subject and transitive object functions
are marked by nominative case. This is almost always realised by zero
inflection. In a fairly small number of languages -l$a can be used to
mark transitive object function on common nouns and adjectives; in
a rather larger number of languages -Na occurs just with proper
nouns, to indicate transitive object (and, in a few cases, intransitive
subject).
Some of the languages which involve -Na inflection on nouns are listed in
Dixon [forthcoming-b]. This affix is plainly cognate with pronominal -Na,
mentioned above.
   There are two common ergative inflections, marking transitive
subject:
   [1] the inflection is commonly -gu or -ygu on nouns ending in
a vowel, but is often a homorganic stop followed by -u when the stem
ends in a nasal. There may also be allomorphic variants, in the case of
stems ending in a vowel, that depend on the length of the stem.
Some examples: Waluwara has simply -gu, with no alternants (this being
derived, by regular sound change, from -ygu). Wembawemba has -gu after
a vowel, -u after a consonant [Hercus, 1969: 46]. Kalkatungu has -{tj)gu on
a disyllabic root ending with a vowel, with assimilation when the root ends in
a consonant [Blake, 1969: 33].
  [2] inflection -lu (with variant -lu in some languages).
For instance, Aranda, in which all stem-final vowels have been neutralised
to a central -a, has ergative inflection -la [Strehlow, 1944: 74]. Note that
Arabana has -ru, a development from -lu.
  In a number of languages both -{fj)gu and -lu ~ -lu occur, as allomorphic
10                                                        1.6 Noun and adjectivevariants of the ergative case. Thus in Walbiri -ygu is used with disyllabic
stems and -lu with those of three or more syllables. In Pitjantjatjara
-lu occurs with proper nouns ending in a vowel and -ygu with common
nouns and adjectives ending in a vowel; proper nouns, common nouns
and adjectives that end in a consonant take a homorganic stop plus
-u in the ergative inflection [Trudinger, 1943: 206/7].
Ergative case inflections are one of the most complex and most fascinating
areas of Australian comparative grammar. A full discussion would be out of
place here but one or two further examples may be given. Thargari has some
similarities to Walbiri: ergative inflection is -gu (a development from -ygu)
with a disyllabic stem ending in a vowel, but -du (with assimilation, etc.) on
all other stems [Klokeid, 1969: 25]. It is tempting to speculate whether the
-du might be related to an original -lu. Gumbaingar makes an interesting
comparison - oversimplifying slightly, ergative is -du after a vowel, a homor-
ganic stop plus -u after a nasal, and just -u after I [Smythe, 1948/9: 29-31].
If Gumbairjgar -du inflection were related to an original -lu it would seem that
-lu can be assimilated to a stem-final consonant in the same way as can -(rj)gu.
The situation is even more complex in Walmatjari; here the ergative inflection
is:
   -lu after a stem of three or more syllables ending in a vowel;
   -rju on a disyllabic stem ending in a vowel;
   -u on a stem ending in a lateral or r;
   -du after a stem ending in a bilabial or apico-alveolar nasal or stop;
   -du after a stem ending in an apico-domal nasal or stop; and
   -3/u after a stem ending in a dorso-velar or lamino-palatal/alveolar nasal or
      stop.
The final three alternants specify a stop after a stem ending in a nasal or a stop;
note the rather limited assimilation here. Alternant -lu is presumably related
to the -lu ~ -lu occurring in other languages; -rju may be related to the ergative
inflection -(y)gu in other languages; it then remains to decide whether the
alternants involving a stop relate to -lu, or to -rju, or whether they are historically
independent of both.
   Virtually every language has a locative - 'at', 'on', 'in' — inflection
of nouns and adjectives. In the great majority of cases this is exactly
the same as the ergative inflection except that the final vowel of the
locative is -a> as against -u for the ergative case. The often complex
alternations encountered in the case of the ergative are exactly repeated
for the locative.
Thus Waluwara has -ga for locative inflection. Gumbaingar has -da after a
vowel, a homorganic stop plus -a after a nasal, and just -a after / [Smythe,
1948/9: 29-31]. And similarly, repeating the alternations sketched above, for
Thargari [Klokeid, 1969: 28], Walbiri and Walmatjari. Different dialects of
the Pi tjantjatjar a/Western Desert language vary slightly in their ergative and
locative inflections - sometimes the two cases are out of step. Thus, for the
1.6 Noun and adjective                                                        11dialect Trudinger [1943: 206/7] describes, proper nouns ending in a vowel
have ergative -lu and locative -la, and common nouns ending in a vowel have
ergative -rjgu and locative -yga. However, in the dialects described by Douglas
[1964] and Glass and Hackett [1970: 34], proper nouns ending in a vowel
take -lu and -la but common nouns ending in a vowel have ergative -lu and
locative -yga.
   In Wembawemba there has evidently been a semantic shift: inflections -ga
after stem-final vowels and -a after consonants signal what Hercus [1969: 46-8]
refers to as the ' general oblique * case with a basic meaning * movement towards';
this contrasts with two locative cases -{g)al 'on' and -(g)ada 'in'.
   In some languages phonological change has clearly neutralised an original
contrast between ergative and locative. Thus in Aranda - a language which
has changed in such a way that now every word ends in the same central
vowel, written a - both ergative and locative inflections are -la [Strehlow,
1944: 202]. In Wik-Munkan, ergative and locative fall together and here the
form -f) probably goes back to -{rj)gu and -{y)ga respectively.
   Languages in which the locative inflection appears not to be morphologically
similar to the ergative include Kalkatungu [Blake, 1969: 33] and Arabana.
   Some languages in the eastern part of the continent have been said
to have a special'instrumental' case. However, a separate instrumental
case is lacking in most languages. Commonly, instrumental coincides
with ergative - that is, both an actor, and the implement he uses, receive
the same inflection. For some languages instrumental coincides not
with ergative but with locative.
Instrumental coincides with locative in Waluwara (both are shown as -ga).
Lardil nouns inflect according to a nominative-accusative pattern so that there
is no ergative inflection; the instrumental is based on the future locative. In
Aranda, ergative, locative and instrumental all fall together as -la. Some early
and not altogether reliable grammars distinguished a quite separate instrumental
-for example, in Yaraikana [Ray, 19076: 272] and in Wiradhari [Gunther,
1892: 57].
   One of the features which characterises languages of the continent
is the affix -gu, that commonly appears with both nouns and verbs.
Nominal -gu, which can be called the 'dative' case inflection, occurs
in a wide variety of languages and marks the indirect object, or some
additional object that is 'implicated' in the event described by the
sentence.
See Capell [1956: 77-8]. A full syntactic and semantic discussion of -gu will
be found in §5.3.3-4 below.
  Some languages have - in addition to locative - separate allative and
ablative inflections; other languages lack these and show the difference
between 'rest' and 'motion towards'/'motion away from' by other
12                                                      1.6 Noun and adjectivemeans. It is not uncommon for dative and allative to fall together.
Where there are separate allative and ablative inflections there is wide
variation of forms between different languages (however, ablative does
have the form -yu{[u) in a fair number of languages).
   The only other case affix with wide occurrence is genitive. There is
more variation of forms from language to language than in the case of
the dative, but cases -gu and -yu do recur fairly frequently. (Occasionally,
genitive and dative fall together, e.g. Gugu-Yimidir [Roth, 1901a: 16,
28].) In all or almost all languages possessive nouns and pronouns can
be declined like adjectives: thus in the marts son hit you, man might
take genitive inflection PLUS ergative inflection. In most cases a further
inflection can go straight on to the genitive form; sometimes a special
affix must be added after genitive and before the further case inflection.
   There are just a few languages with different sets of case inflections,
depending on whether the noun is singular, dual or plural; that is, a
single affix carries an indication both of case and of number (for
instance, Narrinyeri - Taplin, 1880; also Teichelmann and Schurmann,
1840: 5). There are some languages whose noun and pronoun inflections
show tense as well as case - these are located in the Gulf country, or
else due south of the Gulf, as far down as New South Wales.
In Lardil, for instance, each case has both a future and a non-future form
(although there is some neutralisation: for instance, there are non-future
accusative and non-future locative inflections, but a single inflection for future
accusative-locative). The classic example of nouns inflecting for tense is
Pittapitta [Roth, 1897]. See also Capell [1956: 59] on Gunu.
   It is normal for there to be a fair number of stem-forming affixes
that precede case inflections; there is, however, considerable variation
in form and meaning from language to language. The most common
are dual and plural markers; the dual affix is often guDara - see 1.11.
Many languages also have comitative and privative derivational affixes,
that serve to form adjectival stems from noun roots. Thus from noun
papa iwater' in Bailko can be formed papayani 'having water' and
papapati 'without water' [O'Grady et al., 1966: 87]. Comitative and
privative affixes appear to have quite different forms in almost every
language. There is one further affix that has a fair distribution amongst
east coast languages: -gan, serving to derive the feminine form of a
noun.
-gan occurs, with a greater or lesser degree of productivity, in Gumbairjgar
[Smythe, 1948/9: 22-3], Kattarj [Holmer, 1966: 40-1] and Gabi [Mathew,
1.6 Noun and adjective                                                      13
1910: 200]. Capell [1956: 39] mentions that there are four noun classes in
Bandjalang, shown by the affix chosen by a qualifying adjective; in the case
of the feminine class the affix is -gan (see also Cunningham, 1969: 91; Living-
stone, 1892).
   A number of Australian languages, predominantly in the north, show
a system of noun or gender classes. These can be marked either by
class prefixes or suffixes to the noun, or by concord with verbal affixes.
It is likely that noun classes, where they do occur, are a fairly recent
development.
For a full discussion see Dixon [1968c]; also Capell [1956].","[33, 34, 35, 36, 37]"
"
1.12 The development of Australian languages
 Comparative work in Australia is at too early a stage to permit a sure
reconstruction of the stages through which the languages have passed.
 It is, however, tempting to speculate. Suppose it is eventually shown
 (and it is by no means certain that it can be) that all the languages of
 Australia, including the divergent tongues in and around Arnhem Land,
 are genetically related. It would then be probable that proto-Australian
 was at the isolating end of the agglutinative type. That is, it would
 have had some case inflections, and some affixes of other kinds, but
 much less morphological complexity than most present-day languages;
verb morphology, in particular, may have been relatively simple. Most
languages have moved some distance further from the isolating and
towards the inflectional pole. Pronominal forms have been incorporated
into verbs, either as prefixes or suffixes; generic terms have become
gender markers on nouns or verbs; verbs have taken on complex tense
inflections and aspect affixes; and nouns have gained affixes such as
'dual' and 'plural'. There are some languages, however, which have
lost their original case inflections and now use word order to show
syntactic function. The latter type - all spoken in Arnhem Land or
the vicinity - have thus moved in the opposite direction from the
majority of Australian languages, at least as far as noun morphology
is concerned.
   Only detailed descriptions of individual languages, and careful
comparison, will provide support or otherwise for the comments in
the last paragraph. It may, however, be impossible fully to recapture
the history of these languages. Recent archaeological work has suggested
that aborigines have been in Australia for 25,000 or more years - some-
thing like five times as long as the postulated age of the Indo-European
language family. During this period, the languages must have undergone
many geographical and other movements. A tribe may have split into
1.12 The development of Australian languages                               21
two, the parts moved in different directions, one of them merged with
a further tribe (when numbers were, say, reduced due to famine) and
this new tribe may later have split, and so on. Each language may, by
grammatical and lexical diffusion, have influenced and been influenced
by many others at every stage of its development. It may well be
impossible to reconstruct all the complex changes that have occurred
however much we investigate those languages that are still spoken, and
however linguistically acute we are in our comparison of them.
   Almost every point in the grammar of an Australian language is
similar to something in the grammar of some other language; this is
exemplified by the comparative notes included in the description of
Dyirbal. But these similarities seem almost random, and do not in the
present state of our knowledge point to any general genetic subgrouping
of the languages.
   The outlook is, however, far from gloomy. Good linguists are being
attracted to the field and progress, on both synchronic and diachronic
fronts, has been encouraging in recent years. It is likely that whatever
can be reconstructed of the pre-history of Australian languages - and
it may be considerable - will be, in the coming decades.
2      Dyirbal: the language and its
       speakers2.1 Linguistic type
Dyirbal is a typical Australian language. It is entirely suffixing, largely
agglutinative, and has extraordinarily free word order.
   Phonologically it is rather simple, having the smallest number of
phonemes of any Australian language. In addition to four stop-nasal
series - bilabial, apico-alveolar, dorso-velar and laminal - there is a
single lateral, a semi-retroflex continuant, a trill and two semi-vowels.
Dyirbal has the usual three-vowel system, length not being significant.
Roots and inflected words begin with a consonant and have at least
two syllables; intervocalically there are two and three-member consonant
clusters. The first syllables of roots, and of most affixes, bear stress.
   There are clearly defined classes of (first and second person) pronoun,
noun, adjective, verb, adverbal, time qualifier, particle and interjection.
There are four noun classes (genders), marked not in the form of a noun
but by a 'noun marker' that normally accompanies a noun; noun
markers also have some of the functions fulfilled by third person
pronouns in other languages. A noun marker indicates the class of
a noun, agrees with it in case, and also indicates whether the referent
of the noun is visible or invisible; here or there; up hill, down hill, up
river, down river or across river; and whether a long, short or medium
distance up or down.
   Pronouns distinguish singular, dual and plural in both first and second
person; there is no inclusive/exclusive distinction, and no incorporation
of pronominal affixes into the verb. While nouns and noun markers
inflect in a nominative-ergative pattern, pronouns (at least superficially)
follow a nominative-accusative paradigm.
   There is a four-term case system for pronouns and a nine-term one
for nouns, noun markers and adjectives. A pronoun, noun, noun marker
or adjective in genitive case can take a further inflection, provided
a catalytic affix '-^zV is inserted immediately after the genitive. There
are about twenty stem-forming affixes that can precede case inflections
with nouns and adjectives.
                                   [22]
2.1 Linguistic type                                                       23   Verbs and adverbals take a variety of aspectual and derivational
affixes; the tense system has two members - future and non-future.
There is a clear division into transitive and intransitive verbs (and
similarly for adverbals). Two conjugation subclasses correlate statisti-
cally with, but do not coincide with, transitive and intransitive sub-
classes; there is one irregular verb, yanu, 'go'. There is no copula, nor
any verb 'have' or 'become'. The language has wide and much-used
possibilities of verbalisation (that apply to all nouns and adjectives, and
to certain nominal expressions) and nominalisation (that apply to all
verbs and adverbals).
   Sentence modification is achieved partly through a set of about
a dozen non-inflecting particles, and partly through three clitics, that
are added to the end of the first word of a sentence. There is no separate
class of locational words, as there is of time qualifiers. Locational
information is largely dealt with through the complex 'noun marker'
system; there are also some locational adjectives.
   Dyirbal texts contain strong topic patterning: a topic may be stated,
and then commented upon by a string of a score or so sentences,
without repetition of the topic form. Topic patterning exploits the
common Australian 'implicative relation' realised by -gu; this can
occur with nouns, as a dative case inflection, indicating 'indirect object',
and with verbs, instead of a tense inflection, indicating 'result' or
'purpose'.","[44, 45, 46, 47]"
"
5.1 Points to be explained
In the last chapter we mentioned that certain types of sentence were
possible but that other, similar types were impossible; that certain
combinations of processes were acceptable while others were un-
acceptable; and that certain inflections which appeared to be rather
different in function were identical in form. In no case did we attempt
anything more than a limited and ad hoc explanation of these facts.
Before we embark on an investigation of the underlying syntactic
nature of Dyirbal, it will be useful to list some of the points from
chapter 4 that appear to be in need of explanation:
   [1] The fact that word order is quite free, except in the case of
some particles, and when there is multiple embedding. It should be
noted that it is the order of WORDS in sentences that is free, not just
the order of phrases (4.5.4, 4.15.3, 7-8).
   [2] The apparent conflict between the nominative-accusative para-
digm of pronouns, and the nominative-ergative syntax of nouns,
adjectives, and noun markers (3.2.1, 3.3.1, 4.1).
   [3] Case inflections on pronouns - in particular, the difference between
the inflections on singular pronouns in G, and in D and M (3.3.1).
   [4] The affix -pa on nouns - this can occur on a noun in a nominative
NP in O function, but not in one in S function (3.2.1).
   [5] The fact that dative and locative forms can involve -pa, but that
ergative, instrumental, genitive, allative and ablative forms cannot
(3-2.i).
   [6] The two types of -yay construction - the O NP being in ergative
inflection in one, but in dative in the other (4.4.2).
                                  [125J
126                                            5- J   Points to be explained   [7] The fact that there is only one type of -yay construction if the
head of the O NP is a pronoun; it must then be in dative inflection.
(There is thus no pronominal correspondent of a -yay construction in
which the O noun is in ergative inflection - for instance *yad[a yinda
balgalyajiu is impossible.) (4.4.2).
   [8] The unacceptability of -yay constructions of the type ^(92),
which involve an O NP in ergative inflection and a verb in purposive
inflection; this is somewhat surprising in the light of the acceptability
of (65), (67), (69), (90) and (91) (4.4.3).
   [9] The phenomenon of topic-chaining, including topic elaboration
and reversion (4.5).
   [10] Iteration, involving repeated application of the favourite
construction (4.5.4).
   [11] The -yura construction, serving to link together successive
topic-chains (4.5.5).
   [12] The fact that transitive roots in -yay, reflexive or reciprocal
form function intransitively (for instance: they can occur in VCs with
intransitive, but not with transitive, roots) (4.9.3, 4.8).
   [13] Similarly, the fact that an intransitive root in comitative form
functions transitively (4.9.3).
   [14] The acceptability of minimal sentences, which contain no verb
(4-5.i)-
   [15] The behaviour of gijta- forms, which occur only in nominative
case and function rather differently from other noun marker forms
(3.2.2,4.5.1).
   [16] The syntax of participles (4.6).
   [17] The similarities of form between certain nominal affixes, and
certain verbal affixes (cf. 1.7):                 nominal                         verbal
       [a]   simple genitive -yu     relative clause -yu
       [b]   general genitive -mi    relative clause -mi (M only)
       M     dative -gu              purposive -gu ~ -i

and adjectives, as opposed to the non-identity of these inflections in
the case of noun markers and verb markers (3.2.1, 3.2.2, 3.4.5).
   [19] The similarity between ergative and locative inflections -
morphophonological alternations are the same in each case, the sole
difference being that ergative always ends in -u and locative in -a
(3.2.1, 4.10).
   [20] The fact that the -yura inflection on verbs (4.5.5) is identical
to the inflection of the verb in a relative clause to a locative noun:
-yu + -ra (4.10).

inflections (3.2.1, 3.2.2).
   [22] The occurrence of instrumental NPs in both transitive and
intransitive sentences (4.9.1).

NP in ergative case, but leaves untouched an instrumental NP (4.9.1).
   [24] The two different types of instrumental construction - one
involving an instrumental NP and the other an instrumentve VC.
Thus (242) and (253), for instance, are synonymous. The way in
which one of these constructions was informally described as derived
from the other - in 4.9.2 - appears to involve quite ad hoc case permu-
tations, etc.
   [25] The formal identity of instrumentive and comitative verbal
inflections, and the congruence between (242)^253) and (25o)-(26i)
despite further examples of non-congruence (4.9.2, 4.9.3).
   [26] The fact that imperative sentences appear to have some
nominative-accusative characteristics - the NP in S or A function can
be unspecified (4.12.1).
   [27] The fact that locative and allative verb markers and nominals
can be verbalised, but not ablative forms (4.7).
   [28] The syntax of ajia]a (4.15.2).
   [29] The difference in meaning between -gay and false reflexive
forms (4.8.1).
   This is not intended as an exhaustive list of points, but rather
a sample of some of the more important facts that are suggestive of
further, detailed investigation. They are presented in something of
the spirit in which standard manuals of *fieldphonemics' suggest
128                                                 5- 7 Points to be explainedthat, after the phonetic facts of a language are obtained, 'suspicious
pairs' should be circled, and their phonological contrastiveness investi-
gated in some detail. Just as some sounds, which one would guess
might fall together, sometimes turn out to belong to different phonemes,
so some of the syntactic phenomena listed above may not be relatable
to each other. For instance, we ARE able to relate together nominal and
verbal -yu, -mi and -gu> from point [17], but we cannot find any
evidence connecting nominal -bila with verbal -bila; we conclude, at
least in the light of our present understanding of Dyirbal, that the
formal identity between the -bila affixes is coincidental. Similarly, we
are not at present able to offer any explanation of points [5], [18-20]
and [27-9].
The analogy to phonemics should not be taken to imply that there was any
* procedure* attached to our investigation of Dyirbal syntax. Some of the
generalisations of this chapter were formulated before the full range of syntactic
facts had been uncovered; indeed, a major part of the information given in
the last chapter was obtained during the testing of putative hypotheses con-
cerning the deep syntax of Dyirbal.","[149, 150, 151, 152]"

3.1 Semantic content of the open word classes
NOUNS include terms referring to flora and fauna; to parts of the
bodies of humans and of other animals, parts of trees, and so on; to
mineral and other environmental phenomena ('stone', 'earth', 'water',
'fire' and so on); to geographical formations ('mountain', 'forest'),
                                   [39]
40                            J.I   Semantic content of the open word classesmeteorological phenomena ('wind', 'cloud') and celestial bodies; to
noises ('whistle', 'bang'), song-styles and language; to artefacts
('boomerang', 'dilly bag', 'cooking frame') and institutionalised parts
of the environment ('camping site', 'fighting ground', 'track'); to
age/sex groups ('baby', 'girl past puberty', 'newly-initiated man'); to
relations (' father's elder brother',' maternal grandmother'); to particular
people and places (proper names) and to spirits. Other abstract concepts
are expressed primarily through verbs and adjectives, which can yield
derived nouns.
   As with all languages, concentrations of specific terms are encountered
in areas that are important to the life and culture of the people. For
instance, there is a name for each stage in the complex preparation of
miraji' black bean' (2.4). At the opposite extreme, there are a considerable
number of generic terms, many referring to flora and fauna ('snake',
'bird', 'tree' and so on); chapter 8 discusses the semantics of these
generic terms.
   As in other Australian languages [O'Grady, i960], a single term may
cover anything that ACTUALLY IS or POTENTIALLY COULD BE a certain
thing. In the Gfiramay] dialect yugu is the term both for 'fire' and for
'wood/tree' (Dfyirbal] and M[amu] however have bum for 'fire',
reserving yugu just for 'wood/tree'), miraji is the name both for a tree
and for the nut that it bears; nuba is the term both for a bark water-bag,
and also for the tree from whose bark the bag is normally made.
   ADJECTIVES specify value ('good', 'bad'); age ('new'); human
propensities ('greedy', 'worried', 'ashamed', 'angry', and so on);
physiological states (for instance 'fast asleep', 'almost asleep', 'can't
get to sleep'), speed ('fast', 'slow'), physical properties ('heavy',
'sweet', 'hot'); states resulting from actions ('split', 'covered' and
also, for instance, 'finished'); dimensions ('big', 'long', 'deep'); and
position and posture ('inside', 'on top', 'near', 'lying on one side
doubled up'). There are cardinal number adjectives 'one', 'two',
'three', 'many' and 'very many', and a full set of derived ordinals
(6.7). There are only abstract colour terms for 'black' and 'white',
common nouns being used adjectivally to describe other colours - for
instance, gan 'sun' and guygu 'red clay' for shades of red.
   VERBS refer to simple motion ('go', 'cross river'), to simple rest
('stand', 'float'), and to what can be called 'induced motion' ('pull',
'throw') and 'induced rest' ('hold'); to actions that affect the object
('pierce', 'rub', 'burn'); to transfer of possession ('give', 'send'); to
3.1 Semantic content of the open word classes                                     41
actions of seeing, hearing and of ignoring; to all types of language
activity ('speak', 'ask', 'sing'); to bodily functions ('eat', 'cough',
'smell'); to mental activities such as dreaming, planning and liking;
and to the cessation of an action or state ('fall', 'break').
   As in the case of nouns, a single verb may cover both actions that
ACTUALLY HAVE and actions that POTENTIALLY COULD HAVE a certain
result [O'Grady, i960]; and see 4.8.1. For instance, the two English
verbs 'sleep' and 'lie down' would both be translated by bungil (the
Dyirbalrjan as a rule only lie down in order to sleep). In order to state
unambiguously that someone was sleeping, either an adjective or else
the noun rfagun 'a sleep, a night-time' would have to be brought in.
Again, balgal can be glossed, in different instances of use, as ' hit with
a long rigid object, that is not let go of or as 'kill', baygul can refer
either to an action of shaking something, or of bashing something on
something else-its meaning can be described 'put in motion in a
trajectory, not letting go of (whether there is any ACTUAL impact with
some other object is irrelevant here, with this action there is always
a POTENTIALITY of impact).
   A final example of the lack of an actual/potential distinction concerns
bupal, which can refer to both looking (with the potentiality of seeing
a particular thing) and actual seeing; similarly yambal means both
'listen' and 'hear'. Note also that the reflexive of yambal refers to
thinking (literally 'listen to oneself); similarly, the reflexive of mtcful
'take no notice' means 'wait' (literally 'take no notice of oneself).
   ADVERBALS provide semantic qualification of a verb, referring to the
start or finish of an action, or to whether something is done slowly or
fast, well or badly, done again or done too much, and so on.
A fuller account of the rather complex semantics of adverbals, verbs and
nouns is in chapter 8. Dyirbal verb semantics is also dealt with in some detail
in Dixon [1971].
  TIME QUALIFIERS refer to various time distances in the past and future.
As in other Australian languages there is no word 'today', only 'earlier
on today' and 'later on today'. Some locational qualifiers have a
secondary time sense, with 'downhill' corresponding to 'future time'.
There are also qualifiers referring to temporal appropriacy ('too soon'),
as yet unfulfilled expectation (' not yet'), and permutation (' meanwhile').

3.2.1 Case inflections. Nouns and adjectives show identical case
inflections; for five of the nine cases, inflections vary with the phono-
logical ending of the stem. All possibilities are exemplified in Table 3.1.

     ' black guana'     gugar        gugaxu           gugaxyu       gugaxa   The rules for forming cases are as follows:
[1] NOMINATIVE (used as intransitive subject and transitive object) is
    simply the noun or adjective stem;
[2] ERGATIVE (transitive subject) involves the addition of:
      (i) -rjgu to a disyllabic stem ending in a vowel,
     (ii) -gu to a trisyllabic or longer stem ending in a vowel,
    (iii) a homorganic stop plus -u to a stem ending in a nasal or -y,
    (iv) -pi, together with the deletion of the stem-final consonant,
          when the stem ends in -/, -r or ~i;
[3] INSTRUMENTAL is identical with the ergative (there are strong
    syntactic reasons for distinguishing two cases - 4.9.1);
[4] SIMPLE GENITIVE involves the addition of -u for stems ending in
    a nasal, and the addition of -nil for all other stems;
[5] LOCATIVE differs from ergative only in having final -a in place of -u.
   Case affixes that involve no allomorphic variation are:
[6] GENERAL GENITIVE: -mi;
[7] DATIVE: -gu;
[8] ALLATIVE : -gu (allative is identical to dative for nouns and adjectives;
    the two cases do, however, have entirely different inflections in the case
    of noun and verb markers (3.2.2, 3.4.5) and there are also consider-
    able syntactic reasons for distinguishing dative and allative - 6.1.5);
[9] ABLATIVE: -yunu.
j.2 Nominals: nouns and adjectives                                                 43
   The contrast between simple and general genitive is discussed in 4.11.
Very roughly, simple genitive indicates that some object is, or is soon to
be, actually in a person's possession; general genitive - which occurs
much less frequently - indicates that the person used to own the object,
or that he still owns it but does not actually have it in his possession at the
present time. Genitives are only used to describe alienable possession.
There is evidence that the simple genitive inflection should be regarded as
-yu on all stems, and that in the case of a stem ending in a nasal the affix-initial
nasal is deleted, when it precedes an unstressed vowel, by a late phonological
rule. For instance, the form bdlamdggangiiji($inda was observed - bdlamdtjgan
is here in genitive inflection, and then the catalytic affix -jfid,in- is added before
the final locative inflection; in this case affix-initial rj is retained immediately
before a stressed vowel. Final syllables are never stressed, so that an affix-initial
nasal is always deleted when the genitive inflection is word-final.
   The nine cases fall naturally into three groups:
   (i) those that mark syntactic relations: nominative, ergative, instru-
mental, dative;
   (ii) the two genitives;
   (iii) those that give information about motion or its absence: allative
('to'), locative ('at'), and ablative ('from').
   The genitives are set off from the rest since they alone can be followed
by a further case inflection (4.11). In 5.5.2 we relate genitive inflections
on nouns and pronouns to the inflections of verbs in relative clauses,
and suggest that possessive phrases are a special kind of relative clause.
Dyirbal cases follow the typical Australian pattern, described in 1.6. Ergative
inflection involves just -(y)gu with no trace of the alternative inflection -hi
that occurs as well as or instead of -{rj)gu in many languages, including Dyirbal's
northerly neighbours Mbabatam and Yidin. Two genitives are not common,
but they have been reported for Gugu-Yimidir, spoken two hundred miles to
the north of Dyirbal (4.11.2).
   Proper and some common nouns (usually, just those referring to
humans) can take the affix -pa> but only when they are in transitive object
function. For these nouns there are alternative dative and locative
inflections, either with or without -pa (note that no ergative, instru-
mental, genitive, allative or ablative forms can involve -jid). For instance,
in the case of the man's name burbula we have alternatives:
NOMINATIVE (INTRANSITIVE SUBJECT FUNCTION): btirbllla Only
NOMINATIVE (TRANSITIVE OBJECT FUNCTION) :              biirbula or btirbulapa
DATIVE :                                               burbulagu or
                                                        btirbulapdngu
44                                           3'2 Nominals: nouns and adjectivesLOCATIVE:                                              burbulaga or
                                                        burbulapdyga
Note that, following -pa, dative inflection is -ngu and locative -yga.
   -pa behaves quite differently from the regular case inflections in that
it can be followed by derivational and other affixes (6.1.1); the other
case inflections - with the exception of the genitives - cannot be
followed by any other affix, of any kind.
Nominal -pa is clearly related to, and can better be understood by comparison
with, pronominal inflection -na~-jia (6.2). -Na occurs in many Australian
languages, and behaves in much the same way that it does in Dyirbal - see
1.5, 1.6 and Dixon [forthcoming-b].
   Further discussion of Dyirbal case inflections and their functions is in 6.1.5.","[63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68]"

It is impossible adequately to express the writer's gratitude to the
informants, particularly Chloe Grant (mardji or mid,abund,al) and George
Watson (muyirfa, jiiyifa or banganrfala). It is their intelligence, and
their unfailing interest, patience and willingness to work long hours
to suit the writer's convenience, that has made this description possible.
Amongst other informants who contributed to the variety of facts
presented below are the late Paddy Biran (garanba), Tommy Springcart
(rfumbulu), the late Jimmie Murray (girijtfal1)) J ac k Murray (yangaji)
Mosley Digman (badibadi), Joe Kinjun (gijidjubayil\ the late Joe Chalum

   The Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies wholly supported a
year's field work in North Queensland from September 1963 to
September 1964, provided a grant for continuing work on field material
in 1965, partly financed a field trip in March and April 1967, and
wholly financed afieldtrip in December 1970. The writer is most grate-
ful for the constant encouragement, cooperation and help provided by
the Institute, and its principal F. D. McCarthy, throughout this period.
   The Central Research Fund of the University of London generously
provided the balance of finance for the 1967 field trip.
   A special word of thanks is due to the late Lindsay Cowan, Mrs
Cowan and family of Murray Upper, for their continued hospitality
and friendship throughout the eight and a half years of the project;
and to Mr and Mrs Ernie Grant, of Tully, in 1967, and Mr and
Mrs George Henry, of Bellenden, in 1970. Others who helped the
project include Mrs Graham Hay don, Jack Doolan, the late Douglas
Seaton, and Mr and Mrs G. J. W. Gaynor. The Director of the Queens-
land Department of Native Affairs (now: Department of Aboriginal and
Island Affairs), and the various Superintendents and Managers of the
Palm Island Aboriginal Settlement were most cooperative.
   Many of the ideas of chapter 1 (and some of those in other parts
of the book) evolved during discussions with Kenneth Hale and Geoffrey

Mbabajam, Muluridyi, Nyawigi, Olgolo, Wagaman, Wargamay,Warurju,
and some of that from Yidin, is from the writer's own field notes.
   A. Capell has, since 1962, advised and shaped the writer's plans and
given unstinting help in many ways. Thanks are also due, for linguistic
help and advice, to La Mont West, Jnr, and Stephen Wurm. M. A. K.
Halliday, John Lyons, T. S. T. Henderson and Erik Fudge read earlier
drafts of this description and contributed a good deal of welcome
comment. Warren Cowgill gave much useful advice during the writing
of the main draft. John Haiman and Luise Hercus provided valuable
criticism and correction of the final version.
   The writer taught aspects of the grammar of Dyirbal at University
College London in 1965/6, in 1967, and again in 1970, and at Harvard
University in 1968. In all cases, the reactions and suggestions of
students were most welcome. The Harvard class - consisting of Kenneth
Hale, Ives Goddard, Michael Silverstein, Rudolph de Rijk and John
Nicholls - was the most stimulating group the writer has ever confronted;
several important new insights into the underlying grammatical
patterning of Dyirbal emerged during that semester.
   The writer's wife dislikes typical 'acknowledgements to wife'
exusions. Amongst other things, she made a thorough study of the
literature on the area and, much to their surprise, questioned aborigines
on the details of several secret and half-forgotten practices. Partly as
a result of this they continue to view her with awe, and to consider
her the major investigator, with the writer merely a slave deputed to
deal with the dull chores of grammatical detail. So be it.
PrefcaceWhat follows is a revision of the sections on grammar and phonology
of the writer's London PhD thesis [Dixon, 19680]. The main points
of the semantics section have already been summarised in print [Dixon,
 1971]. Further work on the lexicon, and its semantic structure, with
particular reference to the special * mother-in-law language* (2.5, 8.1),
is proceeding, with a view to the eventual publication of a comprehensive
dictionary-thesaurus of Dyirbal.
   Since the grammatical natures of Australian languages are not widely
known, it has seemed worthwhile, in chapter 1, to give a brief survey
of some of the recurring characteristics of languages across the continent.
 In addition, some references to points of similarity in the grammars of
other languages are included, in smaller type, throughout the description
of Dyirbal.
   The grammar is written at two distinct 'levels'. The 'facts' of the
grammar - affixes, their syntactic effect, types of construction, and so
on - are described in chapters 3, 4 and 6. Chapter 5 interprets some
of these facts, setting up explanatory generalisations and describing
the 'deep' grammar of Dyirbal in terms of a number of syntactic
relations and a number of transformational rules. It has seemed desirable
to (at least partially) separate facts from interpretations in the case of
a language like Dyirbal that has not previously been described in any
way. The correctness of chapters 3, 4 and 6 cannot seriously be in
dispute. Chapter 5, however, is far more open to argument. A quite
different set of generalisations, with greater explanatory power, might
well be providable instead of those given here. As linguistic theory
progresses chapter 5 is rather likely to stand in need of revision; this
is unlikely to be true for chapters 3, 4 and 6.
   The writer believes that syntax is, for a number of reasons, more
interesting and more fundamental than morphology and is better
presented first. Chapter 3 mentions the word classes of Dyirbal and
gives inflectional paradigms that are needed for following the account
of syntax in chapter 4. Chapter 5 attempts a ' deep' interpretation of
                                  [xix]
xx                                                                 Prefacesome of the facts of chapter 4. Chapter 6 discusses the non-inflectional
morphology, and gives further detail on some of the inflections. The
phonological description needs to refer to morphological and syntactic
points - one criterion in setting up a phonological description involves
maximum simplicity of morphophonological rules - and is placed after
the grammatical chapters.
   The grammatical description, and particularly chapter 5, is loosely
based on the transformational generative model [Chomsky, 1957, 1965
et al.]. The presentation of grammatical facts, in chapters 3, 4 and 6,
has been influenced in part by the grammar-writing tradition associated
with Franz Boas, Edward Sapir and their pupils [Boas, 1911; Voegelin,
1952; et al.].
   Informality has been aimed at throughout the exposition, in order to
ensure maximum readability. Traditional terms-case names * dative',
'genitive', and so on - have been used wherever possible, in preference
to difficult, unusual or neologised terms. Excessive symbolisation has
been avoided. In particular no attempt has been made to write a
completely formal (transformational) grammar. The transformational
rules that are given have considerable explanatory power (and are by
no means obvious, from the information given in the factual chapters).
A full set of phrase structure rules, and necessary additional trans-
formational rules, can be constructed - by any reader who is interested
in doing so - on the basis of the facts given in chapters 3, 4 and 6.
   The description is built around 'word' and 'sentence'; suffixes,
modifying words, and so on, are added by grammatical processes.
Functional relations - subject-verb, verb-object, etc-are dealt with
in terms of 'deep syntactic relations'. Word order in Dyirbal simple
sentences is extraordinarily free-words can occur in any order in
a sentence (irrespective of phrase membership); order constraints only
really enter with repeated iteration involving more than one indirect
object.
   Dyirbal has very strong topic patterning - that is, grammatical
patterning that involves several sentences in sequence in a text. This
has been described in a fairly ad hoc way, in the absence of any established
grammatical technique for handling it.
  Phonology is regarded as an interpretative component, whose
primitives are systems of phonological features. A phonological feature
has a range of phonic realisation, RELATIVE TO the realisations of the
other features in its system. It should be noted that the phonological
Preface                                                          xxidescription is less complete than the grammar, with no attempt being
made to deal with intonation or sentence stress.
   Informants' judgements of acceptability merged ' grammaticalness'
and ' meaningfulness' (in the sense of Chomsky, 1957: 15). Thus,
sentences that were grammatically illformed were rightly rejected; and,
for instance, the perfectly grammatical bala mic^a baygulyapaggu wamban
'the man is building the mia mia' was also at one time rejected, on the
grounds that men do not build huts. The non-acceptability of bala
mid,a baygul ya^aygu wamban is a cultural and not a linguistic matter.
We have not, as a rule, attempted below to deal with selectional
restrictions, of this or other types.

Abbreviations and ConventionsThe three dialects of the Dyirbal language (2.2) are normally referred
to by single letters:
    D Dyirbal dialect
    G Giramay dialect
    M Mamu dialect
D always refers to the Dyirbal dialect of the Dyirbal language and
never to the complete Dyirbal language.
  Three deep syntactic relations are referred to by single letters:
    S     subject of an intransitive verb, for instance bayi yapa 'the
          man* in bayiya^a djiygalijiu 'the man runs'; balanguda 'the
          dog' in balan guda yanu ' the dog goes'
    A     subject (or agent) of a transitive verb, for instance baygul
          yayaygu 'the man' in balan guda baygul yayaygu balgan 'the
          man hit the dog'
    O     object of a transitive verb, for instance balan guda 'the dog'
          in balan guda baygulya^aygu balgan 'the man hit the dog'
  Three abbreviated names for grammatical classes are employed:
    NP noun phrase, consisting of a head noun, a noun marker, any
       number of adjectives, and so on
    VC verb complex, consisting of one or more verbs and/or
       adverbals, agreeing in surface transitivity and final inflection,
       together with locational adjuncts, and so on
    VP verb phrase, an immediate constituent of a sentence, con-
       sisting of either an intransitive verb complex, or a transitive
       verb complex together with an NP whose words are in
       ergative case
   Examples quoted from Dyirbal texts are referred to by text and line
number. Page numbers are also given in the case of those texts set out
in full at the end of the book. Tapes and transcripts of other texts have
                                 [ xxii ]
Abbreviations and Conventions                                       xxiiibeen deposited with the Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies (see
P. 368).
   Dyirbal sentences are sometimes provided with an interlinear gloss,
and also an English translation of the complete sentence. In the inter-
linear gloss, lexical items are given in lower case and grammatical
elements of all types in small capitals.
   Dyirbal NPs do not obligatorily choose for definiteness or number;
the main tense system involves a contrast between future and non-future
(= present or past). Thus a sentence balanrfugumbilmiyandajiu, quoted
in isolation, could equally well be rendered at least eight different ways
in English 'the/a woman/women laughs/laughed'. In English trans-
lations of Dyirbal examples articles are generally omitted, and singular
or plural, past or present forms are used fairly arbitrarily, or as the
context demands. Both grammatically and lexically, English translations
give only a rough and partial indication of the meanings of Dyirbal
sentences. Nothing concerning the structure of Dyirbal should be
inferred from an examination of the translations.

I Australian languagesThis chapter surveys, rather briefly, some of the recurring linguistic
features of languages across the continent. It does not purport to be
a complete ' Handbook of Australian languages' and does not attempt
to list the many individual variations from the basic pattern.
Further details on some of the points mentioned below will be found in the
surveys by Schmidt, Ray [1925], Capell and Wurm. Schmidt [1912, 1919]
draws some intelligent conclusions from the rather scanty and inaccurate
published material then available. Capell [1956] gives a great deal of important
information, much of it based on his own field work; but even in 1956 far
less was known about Australian languages than today and some of CapeH's
data is, for instance, phonetically suspect. Wurm's [forthcoming] readable
survey essentially repeats and expands some of Capell's ideas, and includes
a lexicographic classification of Australian languages (see 10.1).","[5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25]"
"4.10 Relative clauses
If the topic NP of any sentence has the same referent as any NP - or
locative noun - of a second sentence, then the (rest of the) first sentence
can be embedded as relative clause on to the NP or locative noun of
the second sentence. A relative clause is marked by its verbs and
adverbals taking a special ending, in place of a tense inflection; the
ending depends upon the NP it qualifies.        relative clause to an NP/
           noun in inflection:                  has verbal marking:

-yu> and [2] case ending, agreeing with that of the qualified NP/noun.
Nominative and dative follow the usual rules (3.2.1); ergative/instru-
mental and locative, however, have special forms -ru and -ra> that
occur only after a relative clause marker.
Note that the relation between ergative/instrumental and locative - that they
differ only in the final vowel being -u in the first case and -a in the second - is
maintained; this relation is a feature of Dyirbal (3.2.1, 3.3.1) and of the
majority of Australian languages (1.6).

   The ' common NP * of a constituent sentence must be in nominative
case for the sentence to be embedded on to the ' common NP' of the
matrix sentence. Thus the -yay transformation has to be applied to
a simple sentence, in which the common NP is in ergative case, ahead
of the embedding transformation. With matrix sentence:

   Nouns in allative and ablative inflection cannot be qualified by
relative clauses. Relative clauses have been recorded qualifying a
genitive noun (the case ending on the verb agrees with the case which
follows the genitive inflection on the noun).
4.io Relative clauses                                                 103   Word sequence is very free for most sentences including relative
clauses. The preferred position for a relative clause is immediately
following the NP it qualifies, irrespective of wherever this NP happens,
in this instance, to come in the matrix sentence; the preferred position
is likely to be used for, say, sentences like (280), that include two
ergative NPs, in order to avoid ambiguity.
   In M, but not in D and G, there is a second type of relative clause,
with verbal marking -mi in place of -yu. -mi relative clauses have
exactly the same syntax as the -yu type. Verbal endings are:             relative clause to an N P /
                noun in inflection:         has verbal marking:
                    nominative                     -mi
                    ergative                       -miru
                    instrumental                   -miru
                    dative                         -migu
                    locative                       -mira
There is a difference in that -yu endings replace tense inflections,
whereas -mi endings follow the unmarked tense inflection. Thus:                                relative clause to nominative N P
                   root             -mi type          -rju type
              pinay ' s i t '       jdnajvumi        jtinatju
              balgal' hit'           balganmi        balgarju
   The difference between the two kinds of relative clause in M is one
of aspect, -mi refers to an action that is completed, while -yu refers to
something that is still going on. Compare (300) and (301), which
both involve a relative clause to an implicative NP, and (302) and
(303), which both involve a relative clause to an ergative NP:
(300) yad,a yanu bagul yajagu yinda yuguygu balganmigu I went to
      the man whom you had hit with a stick
(301) yaa]a yanu bagul ya^agu yinda yuguygu balgayugu I went to the
      man whom you were hitting with a stick

      who had finished laughing, spanked boy

      spanked boy while laughing
104                                                  4-10   Relative clauses   An M sentence can consist of just a topic NP qualified by a relative
clause of the -mi type. In this case the relative clause is functioning
like a simple sentence in perfective aspect:
(304) yad,a babilyajtumi bagum mirajigu     I've scraped the beansFurther examples of -mi relative clauses are in text xv, lines 3 and 66
(pp. 369, 380); text xxv, line 29 (p. 390) includes a place name involving
-mi.
   D and G have only one type of relative clause, whose semantic range
covers -mi and -yu clauses in M. A relative clause in D or G can refer
to any time but will normally refer to a time not later than the time
referred to by the matrix sentence. Thus (280), for example, could
mean 'woman is watching me, who had been hit by man', 'woman is
watching man hit me','woman saw man hitting me', 'woman saw me,
who had been hit by man'.
   Note:(305) yinda gilu         bant      yaygu      wudjUgu wugayugu
      you-SA later today come-iMP I-GEN-NOM food-DAT give-REL-DAT
      budilyaygu
      carry-7/#y-PURP
      you come later on, to take some of the food that will have been
      given me by then
Here wugayugu refers to future time, but to a time anterior to that
referred to by imperative bant (together with time qualifier gilu ' later
on today').
   A sentence in D can consist of just a topic NP, qualified by a relative
clause. In this case the relative clause normally implies the completion
of the action:
(306) yaq\a babilyayu bagum mirajigu      I've scraped the beans
Thus, in this instance, a -yu relative clause in D is roughly equivalent
to a -mi clause in M.
   There are two main ways in which relative clauses differ from
participles: [1] a participle can, at most, involve a verb and its object,
whereas a relative clause can include any number of peripheral con-
stituents, such as instrumental and implicative NPs, verb markers and
locational nominals, time qualifier and particles (see (402)), and so
on; [2] a relative clause refers to some actual event (with, in M, an
4*10 Relative clauses                                                     105obligatory aspect specification), whereas a participle indicates that some
person is habitually involved in actions of a certain type. (And cf. the
distinction *'-tor/ # -ter in Indo-European - Benveniste, 1948: 62.)
4.11 Possessive phrases
4.11.1 Involving simple genitive inflection. A topic NP can be
qualified by a possessive NP, all of whose words are in the simple
genitive case (3.2.1, 3.2.2, 3.3.1). The possibilities for inclusion in a
possessive NP are as described generally for NPs in 4.2, except that
a possessive NP cannot include a second (inalienably possessed) noun.
The head of the topic NP is alienably possessed (i.e. NOT as 'a part of)
by the head of the possessive NP:
(307) bayi wayal bayul yapayu baygun djUgumbiiu buyan woman saw
      man's boomerang
(308) yinda yaygu bayi galbin balgan you hit my son
 A further form can be derived from any genitive nominal, noun
marker or pronoun, by the addition of -(/z)</m. Thus:
          yaiayupdjin    from yayayu ' man's'
          yaygudjin      from yaygu ' my'
          bayuldfin      from bayul noun marker (often 'his')
          balagarayujidjin from balagarayu 'the two people's'
In G -yijt occurs instead of -yu(ji)d,in; thus yayayip in place of ya%a-
yujidjin, etc. (See 6.2 for the optional omission of genitive inflection
before -d,in in the case of non-singular pronouns.)
Possessives can be declined in most Australian languages; it is not uncommon
for a catalytic affix to be inserted before any further inflection— 1.6. Notice
that in Narrinyeri [Taplin, 1880: 10, 12] the catalytic affix is -yin, rather
similar to Dyirbal -d,in.
   -djin possessive forms inflect exactly like nominals, and it is these
forms, with the appropriate case inflections, that are used in possessive
qualification of non-topic NPs. For instance, an ergative NP can be
qualified by a possessive NP, all of whose words are in genitive plus
-djin plus ergative form; an implicated NP can be qualified by a possessive
NP whose words are in genitive plus -(fin plus dative inflection; similarly
for an instrumental NP. For example:
(309) balan djugumbil yaygudjindu baygul galbindu balgan my son hit
      woman
106                                                  4.11 Possessive phrases(310) yayguna baygul         gubiygu    gigan           bagul

      wugalyaygu
      give-7/ay-PURP
      gubi told me to give the man his (i.e. the man's) boomerangs
  In addition, any locational nominal may be qualified by a -djin
possessive phrase, with the appropriate locational inflection (3.2.1,
3-4-6, 4.3):
(311) balan d^gumbil jiinajm yaygudjinda mid,ayga woman is sitting in
      my camp
(312) balan djugumbil yanu yaygudjingu mid,agu woman is going to my
      camp
(313) balan d,ugumbil banijiu yaygudjinyunu mid,ayunu woman is coming
      from my camp
  Sometimes, if there is no possibility of ambiguity, a possessive
phrase in genitive case, with or without affix -^m, but WITHOUT ANY
FURTHER CASE INFLECTION, may modify a non-topic NP. For instance:(314) balan d,ugumbil yaygu baygul galbindu balgan (as (309))
(315) balan d,ugumbil jiinajm yaygu mtcfayga (as (311))
(316) balan cfugumbil bani/iu yaygudjin mid^ayunu (as (313))
Informants insist that (314-16) are bona fide alternatives to (309), (311)
and (313), and that they are in no way deviant.
   A genitive-plus-^m form cannot take a further genitive inflection;
'the possessor of a possessor' is put in the same form as 'the possessor',
with word order and/or considerations of sense indicating the syntactic
relations involved:
(317) yaygu bulguyu balagadjin my wife's yamstick
(318) bayi ya%a yaygudjindu yabuyujidjindu baygun gudaygu bad,an my
      mother's dog bit the man
  Possessive qualification of topic NPs most commonly involves simple
genitive forms (e.g. yayguy ya^ayu) although -d,in or -d,i forms (the final
-n may be omitted if -djin is word final) can be used instead.
The writer is unsure of the difference between yaygu forms and rjaygufyn
forms. Two hypotheses have suggested themselves:
   [1] That properly yaygu is a qualifier 'my', whereas rjaygutyn is a head in
^. 11 Possessive phrases                                                        107
its own right 'that which belongs to me'. This could at best be a tendency,
since forms of both types apparently occur with both meanings. However, it
does seem that if an NP does just consist of a genitive form (with no ' possessed'
head stated) then this will more often be a genitive plus -fyn form.
   [2] That yaygu forms are preferred in S function, and r)aygud,in forms in
O function. Again, if this is the correct underlying principle, there is considerable
deviation from it, both forms being encountered in both functions.
   A fragment of a secretly recorded conversation illustrates NP possi-
bilities. A speaker asks to whom a large tin standing some way away
belongs (text reference ix: 92):(319) speaker 1: gijiabawal                     wajiwju    d,ugi

                  whose big thing is that standing over there?
       speaker 2: yaygu d,anapu it's my thing standing [there]
       speaker 3: gijiagijta d,anajiu a]ugi that big thing is just standing
                  there (i.e. unclaimed)
       speaker 2: yaygu bala the thing is mine
The tin has no set name in Dyirbal, and there is no head noun in any
oftheNPsof (319).
  The freedom of word order in Dyirbal can be illustrated from:
(320) bayi             wayal               bayul          yafayu    bulganu

and:

       (320))In (320) the words are in their 'norm' (statistically most frequent)
relative orders - 7.8. (321) is quite typical of word orders in occurring
sentences and was accepted without question by informants.
After his first spell of field work the author wrote that Dyirbal had a remarkably
free word order, and 'made up J (321) to illustrate the possibilities. A well-
known linguist took exception to this, categorically denied that freedom of
word order of this magnitude was possible in any language, and accused the
writer of exaggerating. (321) was put to informants at the next opportunity,

'you know that's alright!'. This anecdote is included to show that the lot of
a linguistic field-worker is not always an easy one.
  As mentioned in 4.5.1, a topic NP involving a possessive phrase can
constitute a complete sentence:
(322) yaygu balan guda the dog is mine ( = it's my dog)
In this case the 'possessed' is head of the NP and topic of the sentence.
To refer to the 'possessor' as topic, a quite different construction is
used, involving nominal affix -bila ' with':
(323) yad,a balanambila gudabila     I have a dog
Further details will be found in the discussion of -bila in 6.1.1.
The contrast between (322) and (323) is reminiscent of the distinction made
by Indo-Europeanists between 'belonging' and 'possession' [Watkins, 1967].
  The proleptic construction, which involves possessive phrases, is
discussed in 6.1.5.","[123, 124, 125, 126, 127, 128, 129, 130, 131, 132]"
"10.3.3 Pronominal cases. One of the most important grammatical
differences between dialects concerns the singular pronouns. G has
forms yayba, yinba for intransitive subject function, and yacja, yinda
for transitive subject; D and M use yad,a and yinda in both functions.
   Gabi, in southern Queensland, and Gumbairjgar, in north New
South Wales, both have different forms for the three functions S, A
and O, for at least some pronouns- 1.5. (No grammatical information
has been recorded for any other language between Wargamay and
Gumbairjgar.) All languages to the north of Dyirbal appear to have
a single pronominal form for both S and A function. It thus appears
that the G dialect is the northernmost member of a considerable span
of languages that distinguish pronominal S and A, and that D is the
most southerly member of a northern chain that do not.
   There are two possibilities: EITHER proto-Dyirbal had a pronominal
system similar to that of G, and its northern dialects have lost the
distinction between S and A forms of singular pronouns; OR proto-
Dyirbal had pronouns along the lines of present-day D and M, and
G has 'borrowed' the S/A distinction from Wargamay. (Note that G
pronouns exactly follow those in Wargamay, even to the extent of
having yajia where D and M have yayguna etc.)
   It is difficult to find any evidence in favour of one or other of these
alternatives. It might be that the fact of pronouns in Dyirbal behaving
syntactically in so strictly a nominative-ergative manner (5.2.2) indicates
that the first possibility is the more likely. But detailed descriptions
of the underlying syntax of other languages, both with and without
an S/A distinction in pronouns, would have to become available before
this type of evidence could be satisfactorily evaluated.
Other grammatical points that can be interpreted to yield indications concerning
the history of Dyirbal include [1] the reflexive alternant, -marly, used with
-y stems - see 4.9.3; and [2] the occurrence of wajta in G corresponding to
tnifia 'what' in D and M - 5.8.4. See also the discussion of -ru~-ndu in 7.7.
io.3 Internal history of Dyirbal                                            35910.3.4 Syllable reduction. It was mentioned in 7.2.2 that Dyirbal
* prefers* just one (or at any rate, as few as possible) unstressed syllables
between each two stressed syllables. It appears that the language tends,
over a period of time, to reduce the number of syllables in a word
more nearly to meet this requirement.
   For instance, there are a number of forms in free variation in the
modern languages:
    mdymiy~mdyimiy '(to) visit in order to be given food or drink'
    djuymal~dfiyimal 'crawl under something'
    ptibaldjina ~ptXbaladjina second person dual accusative pronoun
It appears that in each case the shorter form is in the process of replacing
the longer one. That is, an unstressed vowel is elided and a new
consonant cluster formed, the new form of the word having one syllable
less than the original form. (Note also the discussion of the elision of
a complete syllable, -la-, from the forms of a number of noun and
verb markers - 6.5.1.)
   The long vowel rule in Ngadyan can provide evidence supporting
doubtful cognates, besides demonstrating the process of syllable
reduction. For instance, 'tongue' is d,alaji in Wargamay, Nyawigi and
Waruqu, and in many other Australian languages. In Dyirbal, Mamu
and Giramay ' tongue' is d,alygulay. However, in Ngadyan it is rfalygula:,
with the long vowel rule having applied to the final -y but not to the
first -/-. This suggests that ^alygulay is the reduced form of a compound
of d,alaji with some form gulay. At the time of the long vowel rule the
form was still ^alapgulay in all four dialects (and became d,alajigula: in
Ngadyan), but since then the second vowel has been deleted and the
p assimilated to the following £ (ftg is an allowable cluster at a morpheme
boundary but not within a morpheme).
   This type of change may explain the fact that whereas clusters of
three consonants are rare or non-existent in many Australian languages,
they are rather common in Dyirbal (and in other languages of the
region). Truncation could presumably only take place when an allowable
consonant cluster would result (although there may have been processes
of lenition at work - see the comments on d,>ft in 9.4, 10.3.2).
Almost all the most frequent roots in Dyirbal are disyllabic. A notable exception
is banagay 'return home'. However this form only occurs in D and G, the
M correspondent being disyllabic rjurbay. There are two possibilities - either
the form in proto-Dyirbal was banagay', and has been replaced in M; or else
360                                         io.j   Internal History of Dyirbalthe original form was yurbay, and has been replaced in both D and G. Now
the verb root 'return home' in Wargamay is disyllabic bana. At first sight it
may be difficult to conceive how bana could be borrowed as banagay. But note
that an imperative is formed from a verb stem in Dyirbal by deleting the
final consonant of the stem. In Wargamay (at least for the -y conjugation, to
which bana belongs) imperatives involve the addition of -ga. Thus, the
imperative 'go home' is banaga in each language. And it does seem likely, on
a priori grounds, that a verb should be borrowed in its imperative form.
   All roots in Dyirbal must contain at least two syllables. It is unlikely that
this requirement was applied quite as rigidly in pro to-Australian. Thus, there
is evidence suggesting that the original root '(to) give' was simply wu-\ the
form is zvuga- in Dyirbal, and the -ga- may possibly relate to the imperative
affix -ga, that occurs in perhaps the majority of Australian languages (though
not in Dyirbal) - i .7. Compare with the adjective wugi4a ' generous' in Dyirbal
(and the verb root wugi- 'give' in Wargamay).
Appendix A                Dyirbal logicAs part of what appears to be a continuing campaign to denigrate
Australian languages (thereby demonstrating the supposed lack of
intellect of their speakers) it has been pointed out that 'logical con-
nectors' - 'or', 'because', 'if, and so on - are frequently lacking. Love
[1938: 119] remarked of Worora, 'Alternative propositions do not occur.
The Worora man does not say, Shall I do this or that? He says, Shall
I do this? No. I shall do that. If asked in English, Will you have this
or that? he will invariably reply, Yes, desiring both.'
   Dyirbal does not have any particles exactly corresponding to English
'or', 'if' or 'because' (any more than English has words corresponding
to Dyirbal muguf biri or ward). The language is, however, quite as
capable as English of expressing conditions, alternatives and impli-
cations. Amongst the syntactic means employed are:[ i ] ENTAILMENTThe major construction here is that involving an implicated VC, in
purposive construction - examples were given in 4.4.3, 5.3.3-4. An
implicated VC refers to an action (action^ that is the 'consequence'
of the action (action2) referred to by the preceding NP. There are two
possibilities: (a) actionx was done deliberately, just so that action2
should be possible - e.g. run to a tree to climb it, hit someone to kill
them; (b) action2 is the unavoidable (but unplanned) consequence of
actio^ - e.g. perso^ goes to a place and as a result encounters person2
who (unknown to person^ had settled at the place (see text xxv, line
40, p. 391). Type (a) appears, from an examination of Dyirbal texts, to
be many times more common than type (b). It will be seen that
implicated VCs in Dyirbal cover a wide spectrum of ' entailment';
there is no single connective or construction in English covering exactly
the same ground.
   Certain types of English construction, involving 'since' or 'because',
would be translated by a Dyirbal sentence involving the particle rjuri

(685) yayguna baygul cfilwanjyuri yad,a bayi bid,in[2] 'IF'
An English sentence of the form 'if X, then Y ' where X and Y have
a common NP, would in most cases be rendered by a Dyirbal con-
struction involving Y as main clause with FUTURE TENSE INFLECTION,
with X being relative clause to the common NP in Y. Thus:

(687) bayi yaya iudu balgayuj guyibijt If a man is hit in the hollow in
      the back of his neck, he will die  The Dyirbal verbal inflection -bila~-ba (4.13.1) has some overlap
of meaning with English 'if. -bila~-ba typically occurs following
a negative imperative:
(688) galga bala yama yinda jiimamj minbayirimbila    Don't you squeeze
      the trigger, lest [the gun] go off!","[382, 383, 384, 385, 386]"

5.2 Dyirbal as a nominative-ergative language
5.2.1 A universal hypothesis. All languages appear to have transitive
and intransitive sentences, and thus to involve the three syntactic
functions * transitive subject [A]', ' transitive object [O]' and 'intransi-
tive subject [S]\ It appears that there are two basic syntactic types:
   [1] nominative-accusative languages, in which S is syntactically
        identified with A; and
   [2] nominative-ergative languages, in which S is syntactically
        identified with O.
For instance, most of the languages of Europe and of Africa have
a nominative-accusative syntax. Nominative-ergative languages are less
numerous, but there are a number of well-attested examples - Eskimo,
 Basque, Chinook and so on. (See also Allen [1951], W. K. Matthews
 [1953] and Milner [1962].)
    It has been suggested that some languages are of a mixed type -
 showing, for instance, some nominative-ergative characteristics within
 a basically nominative-accusative syntax. In each such case, when the
 language has been investigated in more detail and depth, it has become
 apparent that it is not in fact of a mixed type. Thus G. H. Matthews
[i960, 1965: i42ff] mentions that' the Siouan languages have often been
5-2 Dyirbal as a nominative-ergative language                                         129cited as languages which exhibit the ergative relation'; he demonstrates
that 'the ergative, in itself, is not a fundamental relation in Hidatsa
[a Siouan language], but rather an automatic result of a fundamental
distinction between two types of verb phrase, and a general causative
construction'.
Halliday [1967-8] has recently suggested that English involves a mixture of
nominative-accusative and nominative-ergative patterning. It is easy to show
that English is, in fact, pure nominative-accusative in syntax - in the same
way that Matthews showed this for Hidatsa - and that what appears to
Halliday to be evidence for a nominative-ergative character is the result of
transformational changes on a nominative-accusative base. Some of Halliday's
examples are causative versions of underlying intransitive constructions - ' he
marched the prisoners', which is related to 'the prisoners marched'. The
causative transformation is attested for a large number of languages and
appears to have some kind of universal status; it is thus quite natural to posit
a causative transformation in English. Languages that are morphologically
rich often have a special affix that marks a verb as causative - this is the case
in Swahili and Turkish, for example; it is quite natural that English, with its
rather limited morphological resources, should mark causatives entirely through
word order. Halliday's other examples involve the phenomenon of bringing
a non-subject NP to the front of a sentence - as in ' the clothes washed [well]',
derived from ' [someone] washed the clothes'. This can only be done in the
presence of a manner adverbal, modal, or other qualifier; the process applies
not only to object NPs but also, in appropriate circumstances, to instrumental
NPs, locative NPs, and perhaps others [Dixon, 1970 c]. Halliday pays no
attention to the formulation of strong hypotheses concerning linguistic universals,
and is thus happy to accept that English is syntactically 'mixed'. It is, in fact,
his failure to set up any 'deep structure' that will deal with the underlying
semantic relations, and his insistence on setting up systems which will directly
generate 'surface structures', that lead him to suggest that English is part
accusative, part ergative in character.
   The facts concerning known languages suggest the postulation of
a ' universal hypothesis *:
   Each natural language is either strictly nominative-accusative, or
      strictly nominative-ergative in syntax,
or, putting the same claim in different words:
   In any language, the syntactic function in an intransitive construction
      (S) is syntactically identified with one and only one of the functions
      in a transitive construction (that is, either with A or with O).
   It appears on the surface that there are two constructional patterns
in Dyirbal - the nominal nominative-ergative type, and the pronominal
nominative-accusative type (4.1). Dyirbal thus initially appears to be
a language of mixed type, and to constitute an exception to the universal
130                         5- 2 Dyirbal as a nominative-ergative languagehypothesis. In fact we shall show that there is only one UNDERLYING
constructional pattern - the nominative-ergative type - that applies to
all sentences, whether involving nouns or pronouns or both. A detailed
investigation of its syntactic functioning thus reveals Dyirbal to be
a 'pure' nominative-ergative language.","[152, 153, 154]"
"
1.4 Syntax
The most common situation is for nouns to inflect according to a
nominative-ergative pattern, while pronouns at least superficially follow
a nominative-accusative pattern. That is, nouns have a single case
(nominative) marking intransitive subject and transitive object functions,
and another case (ergative) for transitive subject function. Pronouns,
on the other hand, have one case marking transitive and intransitive
subject and another for transitive object.
   In a few languages pronouns inflect in a nominative-ergative pattern,
like nouns. There are also some languages where both pronouns and
nouns follow a nominative-accusative pattern.
Walbiri is an example of a language in which both nouns and pronouns inflect
in a nominative-ergative pattern [Hale, 1970: 776-9]. Hale [1970: 759] reports
that languages in which both nouns and pronouns follow a nominative-
accusative pattern are * found in two widely separated areas: the Wellesley
Islands and adjacent mainland in North Qld. (e.g. Lardil, of Mornington
Island; Kayardilt, of Bentinck Island; and Yanggal of Forsythe Island); and
the northwest coast of Western Australia (e.g. Ngaluma of the Roebourne
1.4 Syntax                                                                      5area, and Yintjipanti of the Fortescue River area)'; see also von Brandenstein
[1967].
   Word order is in many cases extraordinarily free; in many languages
every word in a phrase is inflected for case, and words can and do occur
in any order in a sentence. In other cases there is both less inflection
and less freedom - thus, in Gumbaingar, nouns are always inflected
but the inflection may be omitted from an adjective when it immediately
precedes the noun it qualifies [Smythe, 1948/9: 68]. There is probably
in all languages an underlying ' norm' word order - in this the verb is
usually sentence-final.
  Very little work has been published on relative clauses, complements
and the like; it is thus not at present possible to make any generalisations
about these or related phenomena in Australian languages (but see
Dixon, 1969).","[28, 29]"
"5.5.2 Possessive phrases. We have not so far discussed the syntactic
status of possessive phrases. At first sight it might seem that the
relation between a possessive phrase and the NP it qualifies should be
treated as an additional type of syntactic relation. We shall show that
it can more revealingly be treated as a special instance of the relative
clause construction.
180                              5-5   Relative clauses and possessive phrases   There are a number of striking similarities between relative clauses
and possessive phrases:
   [i] PHONOLOGICAL IDENTITY OF INFLECTIONS. Simple genitive
inflection, -yu> is identical with the inflection verbs bear in relative
clauses. General genitive inflection, -mi> is identical with the inflection
in a second type of relative clause that occurs only in M.
   [2] DISTRIBUTIONAL SIMILARITY. Genitive -mi is far less common
than the simple genitive -yu; in addition, -mi inflections occur only
on nouns and adjectives, whereas -yu also occurs on noun markers and
pronouns. As we have mentioned, -mi relative clauses are only attested
in the M dialect.
   [3] SEMANTIC SIMILARITY. In M, -yu relative clauses involve 'im-
perfective' and -mi clauses ' perfective' aspect. In all dialects, genitive
-yu indicates a relation of present possession, whereas -mi indicates
a past owner.
   [4] SYNTACTIC SIMILARITY - i. A sentence can consist of just a noun-
plus-marker and a possessive form-see (102), (322); similarly, a
sentence can consist of just a noun-plus-marker and a relative clause -
see (304), (306).
   [5] SYNTACTIC SIMILARITY - 2. Both relative clauses and possessive
phrases can qualify nouns in nominative, ergative, dative, instrumental,
and locative cases. There is a difference in that possessive phrases -
but not relative clauses - can qualify nouns in allative or ablative case.
   [6] SYNTACTIC SIMILARITY-3. An NP in a relative clause can be
qualified by a further relative clause; similarly, a possessive phrase
can be qualified by a relative clause.
   [7] MORPHOLOGICAL SIMILARITY. Both a genitive noun, and the verb
of a relative clause, agree in case with the noun they qualify.
   This suggests that the underlying representation of a possessive
phrase be a relative clause whose VC is the dummy verb possfesses].
Thus, corresponding to (cf. (307)):
(488) bayi wayal bayul yayayu bayguntfugumbipubuyan woman saw
      man's boomerang
5.5 Relative clauses and possessive phrases                           181we have:
(lxxxix)
NOTE: Trees are simplified by the omission of NP' nodes, unless there is
a sister relative clause.
  (lxxxix) satisfies constraint in, and rule (#-ii) then applies, deleting
the leftmost NP of S 2 . Case and verb marking conventions yield:
(xc)
                                     T
We can now suggest a rule that replaces the case feature of NP 2 by the
features attached to POSS, and deletes POSS.
182                                            Relative clauses and possessive phrases  Generally, where [case] stands for whatever case has been assigned
to the NP by (£'), the rule can be stated:(6) POSSESSIVE FORMATION RULE       X NptNP'tcasel    S [NP [ e r g ]
       1
                                           vc6 [rell teasel

                                                              JsJ NP    X
             ^     3          4 5                  7                   9
       i     2 3              478              0 0 0                   9
      IF 6 = POSS
      and 6 does not involve the feature [-yay]
In M, the feature [ ± perfect aspect] will occur with [rel] and will be
transferred to NP2 by rule (#).
   We have suggested that alienable possession involves an underlying
relative clause with verb POSS; but that, by rule (#), the inflections on
POSS are transferred to the 'possessor' NP, POSS itself being deleted.
   Applying rule (6) to (xc) we get:
(xci)
                                           T
which is precisely (488).
   It should be noted that as rule (&) is stated it must apply after case
and verb marking conventions (/?') and (e). It would be possible to
formulate the possessive formation rule in such a way that it applied
after constraint 111 but before (/}') and (e). We could have a rule that
simply deleted POSS :
5.5   Relative clauses and possessive phrases                                183(Qf) POSS DELETION
         X       S [X    VC] S       X
         1
                         2    3      4
         1          2      0         4
      IF 3 = POSS
      and 3 does not have the feature [-yay]Now, convention (e-iii) would have to be modified. In the case of
a normal relative clause (illustrating by reference to nodes in (xc)) we
can think of 2 2 as 'handing down' a feature [rel] to VPX and then to
VCX; similarly, NP2 hands down its [case] feature to 2 2 to VP1 to VCj.
In the event that VCX has been deleted before (e-iii) is applied, we
can adopt the convention that the features [rel] and [case] are handed
down by VPX to the only node it now dominates, that is NP2, and
replace the case marking that NP2 has from (j8'-iii).
   These two treatments are entirely equivalent, and there appears to
be no syntactic reason to prefer one over the other.
   Dyirbal has no sentences in which the SUBJECT of an underlying
possessive relative clause is identical with some noun in the matrix
sentence (sentences like 'The man who owns the dog is coming'). That
is, we cannot allow a possessive clause similar to the relative clause in
(lxxxiii), with the -yay transformation having to be applied to obtain
a tree that satisfies constraint in. Rules (6) and (#') have been phrased
to exclude illicit possessive clauses - if POSS is marked as [-yay]y the
structural description for (d) and (#') is not satisfied, and POSS will not
be deleted. The dummy POSS should not appear in surface structure,
and so an illicit surface string results.
Sentiments like ' The man who owns the dog is coming' are dealt with through
a quite different construction, involving -bila - see 4.11.1 and 6.1.1.
   Dyirbal has no purely grammatical verbs (that is, verbs without
concrete reference) such as 'to be', 'to become', 'to have', 'to make
(cause to do)'. It is thus entirely natural that POSS should not be
realised as a phonological word, but should trigger rule (#), and be
deleted by that rule.
The argument supporting this 'naturalness' can be formulated as follows. It
appears that all grammars involve certain deep grammatical relations such as
'possession', 'adjectival predication', 'causation', and so on. In some languages
these relations are realised through separate words ('surface verbs') such as
English 'have', 'be', 'make (do)', etc. In other languages they are realised
184                                5-5 Relative clauses and possessive phrasesnot as separate words, but either overtly as affixes, or covertly through the
triggering of transformational rules that affect other constituents. Now it is
an empirical fact (although admittedly of a type that linguists have paid little
attention to in recent years) that languages tend EITHER to have * surface verbs'
realising most or all of these deep relations, OR ELSE to have * surface verbs'
realising none of them. Dyirbal is of the latter type, and it is in view of this
that it is said to be * natural' for POSS not to be realised overtly as a surface
verb, but only covertly through its triggering of rule (6).
   Dixon [1969] compares the syntax of relative clauses and possessive phrases
in Dyirbal and Gumbaingar, and concludes that the two languages demand
a common set of rules, but with different conditions and slightly different
ordering. The -mi affix on nouns and verbs was not clearly understood when
this paper was written, and discussion was confined to -rju forms. The additional
data given above provides further strong support for the solution given in
 1969.
   Further discussion of -mi in M is in 10.3.2.
  In this section we have dealt with points [ija-b] from 5.1.5.6   -rjura constructions
The -yura construction can be represented by a tree in which VP
dominates a second T node. Thus, underlying (cf. (147)):
(489) bala yugu baygul yapaygu madan {bayi yapa) wayjifyyura              man
       threw stick and then he immediately went uphill
is:
(xcii)                      T,
                                                   wayjid,il
      i
$.6    -t)urdi constructions                                            185In such a tree, the leftmost NP dominated by VP, and the topic of T 2 ,
must have identical reference. This requires a further constraint:
CONSTRAINT IV
In: X V P [NP X T [^[NP X] E S [NP X] S ... S [NP X] E ] T ] V P X
    i       23        45         67             2n 2 n + i     2n + 2
      where n ^ 2
      the head nouns of 2, 4, ..., 2n must have identical reference
Then, all or part of the portion of each 2i (i ^ 2) that is also included
in 2i-2 can optionally be deleted.
   Tree (xcii) meets this condition. Convention (/3') assigns cases to the
NPs in (xcii) that correspond to those in (489). To deal with the
inflection on wayjidjil a further clause must be added to convention
(e):
(e-iv) a VC whose lowest dominating 2 is dominated by T, that T
       being itself dominated by VP, is given inflection -yura.
  As a further example, consider (cf. (153)):
(490) bala yugu baygul yaiatjgu nudinj (bayi yaxa) bagul jialygagu
        bund/ulyayura man cut tree [until he stopped to] spank boy
This has tree representation:
(xciii)
186                                                   5.6   '-rjura* constructions(xciii) does not satisfy constraint iv. We can, however, apply the -yay
transformation in the cycles on S 3 and S 2 ; and then, constraint n
being satisfied for S 2 and S3, transformations (#-i), (£) and (?/) apply,
producing:
(xciv)
                                                              bayi
                                                             jialrjga
which does satisfy constraint iv. Conventions (/3') and (e) now give
(490) as the realisation of (xciv).
   A -yura construction, which involves a VP dominating T, is rather
different from a purposive construction, in which S dominates 2.
A purposive construction establishes a * subroutine* WITHIN a topic-
chain ; this may terminate at any point, and the chain will then continue
with comment on the original topic - 5.4.5. -yura marks the termination
of one topic-chain and the establishment of a new one; it is impossible
in this case simply to 'revert' to the original topic.
There is no strong syntactic evidence pointing to the * correctness' of our
tree representation of -rjura constructions - as there was, for instance, sup-
porting the analysis of possessive phrases in 5.5.2. The most we can say is
that the analysis given above agrees well - in terms of constraint iv - with
conditions in other parts of the grammar, and explains the case inflections
in the -pura construction.
   Empirical evidence in favour of this analysis lies in the occurrence of sentences
with more than one verb in -tjura inflection, e.g. balan barjgul balgan (bayi)
pinayura miyandatjura 'he hit her, sat down, and laughed*. Here we appear
to have a genuine topic-chain, dominated by VP.
5-6   '-yura* constructions                                                   187   Point [20] in 5.1 drew attention to the fact that the -tjura inflection on verbs
is identical to the inflection a verb receives in a relative clause to a locative
noun - -yu + -ra, as in (298-9). The fact that certain verbs select only locative
qualifiers, whereas others occur only with allative or ablative forms (3.4.6)
suggests that locational qualifiers be regarded as constituents of VP. Thus,
underlying (cf. (298)):
(491) bayi yaxa jiinajiu bunitjga jiadurjura bay gun fagumbixu man is sitting by
       fire woman made
is (using LocP for the constituent involving verb marker and/or locational
noun):
(xcv)                 T

                                             djUgumbilIt is interesting to note the syntactic similarity between the -tjura verb in
(489) and the verb in -yu + -ra inflection in (491). In each case the VC is
dominated by VP which is dominated by 2 ; this is in turn, at one step remove,
dominated by VP. The difference is that in the first case the intermediate
node is T and in the second case LocP. This syntactic similarity — coupled
with phonological identity - may be entirely coincidental; it may, on the
other hand, provide a clue to the historical origin of -tjura constructions (see
also 5.7.6). Further work is required on this issue.
   We have, in this section, dealt with point [11] from 5.1.","[203, 204, 205, 206, 207, 208, 209, 210, 211]"
"
6.2 Pronominal morphology
Pronominal forms (listed in the paradigm of 3.3.1) can be analysed in
terms of categories of first and second person, and of singular, dual
and plural number. For each person and number we can recognise a
* general root':
                          first person          second person
  singular             yaygu                    yinu
  dual                 yali ~ yalid,i          pubala ~pubalad,i
  plural               yana ~ yanad,i          pura(y) ~purad,i
The case forms in D and M can now be analysed (cf. 5.8.2):
                            singular                 non-singular
  [ + actor] form      [see below]              general root
  [ — actor] plus
    nominative form    general root + -na      general root + -na
  genitive             general root            general root + -nu ~ -yu
  dative               general root + -ngu     general root + -na + ngu
and in G:
                            singular                 non-singular
  [ + actor] form      [see below]              general root
  [ — actor] plus
    nominative form    [see below]             general root + -pa
  genitive             general root            general root + -nu ~ -rju
  dative               general root + -ngu     general root + -pa + -ngu
In the table of 3.3.1 G appears to have borrowed the D form for the
second person dual pronoun, except that the distinctive G second
vowel i is retained; it seems that the forms given in 3.3.1 are in free
variation with forms that would be expected from the rule above.
  The genitive inflection is in all dialects -yu on to a disyllabic stem
and -nu on to a stem of three or more syllables.
244                                               6.2 Pronominal morphologyNote that the pseudo-pronoun balagara (3.3.2) forms a genitive by adding
-rju, showing that it inflects as a noun and not as a pronoun.
   Note also that -jta is optional on [ — actor] nouns and - since other stem-
forming affixes can follow it - is best regarded as a stem-forming affix and not
as a case inflection with nouns. With [ — actor] plus nominative pronouns,
-na (DM)~-jta (G) is obligatory and must be regarded as a case inflection.
balagara and balamaygan behave like nouns in this respect.
   -djin can be added to a genitive form (4.11) and the resulting form
given any case inflection; in the case of dual and plural pronouns the
genitive -yu~-nu affix can optionally be omitted in -d,in forms. We can
thus have either yaliyujidjinda or yalidjinda ' at that which belongs to us
two*. A form yalidjinda is structurally analogous to the -d^in plus locative
form of a singular pronoun, where the genitive formis just the general root.
Similarly, in the case of the interrogative pronoun, wayiud,in alternates with
voajiurjujid/in.
   Non-singular dative forms can be regarded as derived from [ — actor]
plus nominative forms by the addition of -gu; the -n- is a predictable
phonological intrusion (7.5.1). In D and M the -na- is usually dropped
from dative forms. However, this is not absolutely obligatory - D
speakers have been heard to use jiubalad,inangu rather than jiubalarfingu,
and informants accepted the first form as possible although preferring
the second (on the grounds that it was 'shorter').
We must assume the -na- is present in the underlying forms (of both singular
and non-singular pronouns) in order to explain the presence of -n- in non-#
forms - by a rule of 7.5.1, n is inserted before dative -gu only when immediately
following a stressed vowel.
  The seventh pronoun in M, a special type of first person dual, has
general root yanaymba, and inflects like the regular duals and plurals.
  The singular pronouns show additional complexities that suggest
the postulation, in addition to the general root, of what we can call
a * basic root'. Thus:                  , .                 ,
                                       basic root general root
           First person singular          yay          yaygu
           Second person singular         yin          yinu
  We could say that the pronoun forms not dealt with above are
derived from the basic root:
               f + actor! form in D and     M l , .
               r        T ,            r    - rxc   basic root + -da
               [ +actor] plus ergative form in GJ
               [ +actor] plus nominative form in G basic root+ -ba
               [ — actor] plus nominative form in G basic root + -pa
6.2 Pronominal morphology                                                   245 In all other cases G pronouns involve -pa where D and M have -na. The
justification for recognising -pa rather than -na in the singular [ — actor] plus
nominative forms is [i] the common Australian affix is -Nay realised as -na
in languages having a laminal contrast, and as -pa in languages with a single
laminal series (1.2, 1.5). Gugu-Badun has a pronoun paradigm very similar
to that of G; it differs from G in that it has two laminal series instead of one.
The first person singular object pronoun in Gugu-Badun is tjana against G's tjapa.
[2] if the affix is recognised as -pa, we have tfin +pa -> tjina in G. This agrees
with the rule needed for genitives and for balamarjgan, balan plus -pa — in
certain circumstances, the first of two consecutive nasals is dropped-3.2.1, 6.1.1.
   Against this is the consideration that -yn- is an impossible sequence intra-
morphemically, being replaced by -p- (7.5.2). Thus if the affix were -na, rjapa
would be simply explainable; if the affix is -pa we have an apparently un-
motivated dropping of -y- from tjaypa.
   There are synchronic grounds for considering -ba a case affix in G. However,
the likely historical explanation is that [ — actor] plus nominative forms were
originally just the basic root - as is the case nowadays with east coast languages
such as Gabi (1.5). -ba has been added to roots in a number of languages for
PURELY PHONOLOGICAL REASONS, e.g. so that every word should be at least
disyllabic (probably the reason here), or so that every word should end in
a vowel [Hale, mimeo-c: 93ff].
   The affix -da provides a tidy analysis —yd- is not a possible intramorphemic
cluster, and would be replaced by -4- (7.5.2). However, once it is realised
that -ba is not properly a case affix, the recognition of -da as an affix becomes
less plausible. Historical investigation may eventually relate -da (~-du in
other languages) to ergative -lu; but it is equally likely that further study will
show that there is insufficient evidence to justify any kind of analysis of yarfa
 and yinda.","[267, 268, 269]"
"5.11.3 Ordering of rules. Only two rules are in the 'cycle' (which
applies from the lowest 2 upwards, as in Chomsky [1965]) - (a) and
(y). Only one can apply in the case of any 2 , but obligatory rule (y)
could be said to be ordered before optional (a), since if a 2 meets the
structural description of (y), rule (y) must apply and (a) cannot apply.
   Constraints I-IV apply immediately after the cycle; (S-i) must apply
if constraint 11 is met, and (S-ii) if constraint in is met. (rj) is ordered
after (S-i). (K), (A), (t), (Q and (/x) apply post-cyclically, but with no

(t), otherwise the latter may delete an occurrence of INST that should
have been raised by the former; however, rule (L) could easily be
restated so that it could apply before (/c).) The ordering of (6) was
discussed in 5.5.2.
   Marking conventions (/3') and (e) normally follow transformations.
However, the optional rule that deletes some or all of a repeated topic
(mentioned informally as the last sentence of constraints 1 and i v -
pp. 155 and 185) must follow (/?'), if incorrect case assignments are to
be avoided.
   As mentioned in 5.4.5, the constraints must apply from the topmost
2 downwards.
An argument could be made out for (A) being in the cycle - see (272) and
5.7.4; there are, however, equally compelling reasons for regarding it to be
post-cyclic.
6 Morphology6.1 Morphology of nouns and adjectives
6.1.1 Stem-forming affixes. There are about a score of affixes in
Dyirbal that form nominal stems from nominal roots; some of them
also function as affixes to members of other word classes. Some of the
affixes are important syntactically - for instance -bila ' with' as a type
of possessive, and -gara and -maygan as coordinators; others merely
provide semantic qualification of the noun or adjective they occur
with. NPs involving certain of the affixes can make up complete
sentences; this is not so in the case of other affixes.
   The full functional possibilities of each affix are described below.
The section ends with a discussion of the use of bound forms dayi
galu, etc. (3.2.3) as nominal affixes.
   [1] -pa This affix has already been discussed in 3.2.1 and 5.8.3. It is
listed as a stem-forming affix, rather than as a case inflection, because
[i] it is always optional with nouns; and [ii] it can be followed by other
stem-forming affixes, -pa is generally added only to a nominal referring
directly to a particular person or persons - a proper name, or else a
noun used in a particular instance as a proper name.
In the case of a stem of three or more syllables ending in a vowel, ergative
and dative inflections coincide; thus burbulagu is ambiguous - it could be
either ergative or dative. Now a considerable proportion of proper names are
of three or more syllables, and are thus open to this ambiguity. But it is with
proper names that -pa is most used, and the inclusion of -pa can help to resolve
the ambiguity - burbulapangu is unequivocally dative (an ergative form cannot
involve -pa), -pa does not normally occur with common nouns; but the
majority of the most frequent common nouns are disyllabic, with distinct
ergative and dative forms (3.2.1).
   -pa commonly occurs as a suffix to balagara and balamaygan: the
p drops with balamaygan, so that we have balagarapa and balamaygana.
The dative inflection of balagarapa can thus be bagugarapa, bala-
garapangu or bagugarapangu (3.3.2). -pa can also occur with noun
markers and interrogative noun markers, but only in the presence of
a further affix - 6.5.6.
                                    [221]
222                                   6.1   Morphology of nouns and adjectives   [2] -bila DG, -ba M 'with- \ -bila can be suffixed to a noun, the
resulting form functioning as an adjective:
(534) bayi yaya yugubila banijtu man with stick is coming
It can also be suffixed to adjectives, and to noun markers that are
already in -jia form, i.e. bayijiambilay balanambila, balamambilaf bala-
jiambila. We can thus have a complete 'comitative NP', modifying
 a head noun, e.g. balajiambilayugubila bulganbila 'with big stick', from
 bala yugu bulgan i big stick' in:
(535) bayi yaya balajiambila yugubila bulganbila banijtu man with big
      stick is coming
or else just:
(536) bayiyaia bulganbila banijtu man with big thing is coming
However, a noun-plus-£z7a is only infrequently accompanied by a
noun-marker-plus-fo'/tf (as against a head noun, which is usually
accompanied by a noun marker).
   With a nominal-plus-^tf form we get simply -paymba in M, but
-jtalaymbila in D and G:
      DG rjali dumbulunalaymbila baninu)              ., ^   , ,
      A/T   /• J 7 1      11   •     f we two came with Dyumbulu
      M     yah qumbulujiaymba banijtu        J
  As mentioned in 4.11.1, a sentence can consist of just a head noun
and a noun-plus-bila:
(538) yad,a (balanambila)gudabila I have a dog [literally: I, with dog]
compare with:
(539) VaySu balan guda the dog is mine
However, constructions like (538) are not simply the converses of constructions
like (539), and should not be related to the dummy verb POSS (5.5.2). Consider:
(540) rjayguna baygun gudarjgu yazagu/i(jindu bac}an man's dog bit me
This states that a dog bit me, and that the dog belongs to a certain man; it
carries no inference that the man is involved in the action - he could have been
encouraging the dog, or he could have been many miles away. Now consider:
(541) rjayguna baygul yaxaygu gudabilagu baigan man with dog hit me
This implies that the man hit me; that the man has a dog; and also that the
dog assisted the man in hitting me. It is thus NOT equivalent to the English
'man who has/owns a dog hit me*. Whereas possessive phrases appear to
function like relative clauses (5.5.2) -bila forms appear quite unlike relative
clauses.
6.1 Morphology of nouns and adjectives                                        223  A typical topic-chain involving a -bila form in ergative inflection is, in M:
(542) barjgul      gamabagu       balan         bid,aman         \balan
      THERE-ERG-I glin-WITH-ERG THERE-NOM-II Swive-PRES/PAST THERE-NOM-II

      PARTICLE give-REFL-PREs/PAST threaten-REL-NOM shoot-PURP gun-iNST
      he, with a gun, swived her; she had to give herself, having been
      threatened that she would be shot with the gun
   [3] -baray M 'with a lot of-'. Thus, bayi yibiba banijiu refers to
a man accompanied by one woman, bayi yibibaray banijtu refers to
a man amongst a crowd of women, -baray occurs most commonly with
nouns referring to humans; unlike -bila~-ba it cannot be affixed to
noun markers. A noun that involves -baray is frequently (but not
necessarily) reduplicated.
   [4] -yaygay DM, -biday G 'without-', -yaygay can be suffixed to
a noun, the resulting form functioning as an adjective. It can also, like
-bila, be suffixed to adjectives; but unlike -bila, it can NOT be suffixed
to noun markers. Thus:
(543) bayi yaia yuguyaygay banijtu man without a stick is coming
(544) bayi ya^a baygayyaygay bulganyaygay banijiu man with no big
      spears is coming
(545) bala yugu baygul ya^aygu fyigumbilyaygaydjU maygan man with
      no wives picked up stick
Sentences frequently consist of just an NP, that includes a -yaygay
form:
(546) bala mid,a banayaygay there's no water at the camp (literally:
      the camp is without water)
See also (106) in 4.5.1. The form wapayaygay is discussed in 6.6.
Most Australian languages have nominal affixes with similar meaning and
function to Dyirbal -bila and -waygay; however, none of these affixes appear
to be cognate with the Dyirbal forms - see 1.6.
   [5] -ginay 'covered with - , full of - ' . This affix can be suffixed to
a noun, the resulting form functioning as an adjective, -ginay has very
restricted use: it is normally used only of' something dirty or unpleasant',
and is apparently used less nowadays than previously. Thus we can
have bala djina banaginay ' foot covered with waterJ to refer to someone
who has been walking in puddles and tramples water into a house.
Other typical uses are d,ud,aiginay 'covered with urine', gunaginay
'covered with faeces' and muraginay 'covered with, or full of, semen'
224                                6.1   Morphology of nouns and adjectives(text reference xxx: 7, 10). Note also balan war ay i wurmburginay 'a
bream full of bones (making it a difficult fish to eat)5, -ginay cannot be
suffixed to noun markers, and has not been observed occurring as an
adjectival suffix.
   [6] -yunu 'out of- , from - ' can be suffixed to nouns and adjectives,
the resulting form functioning as an adjective; it cannot be suffixed
to noun markers. With nouns, -yunu can refer to location or to time
(it can also be affixed to time words, see 6.4):
(547) bayi          d,aban baygun           mawaygu
      THERE-NOM-I eel-NOM THERE-ERG-II shrimp-ERG
      djupayunugu             a]ayganajiu
      leaves in water-FROM-ERG eat-T/ory-PREs/PAST
      eel eats shrimps from the leaves
(548) yaa]a bayi ya^a jialygayunu wucjiman I brought the man up
      from a boy
See also banayunugu in text xv, line 71 (p. 380).
   A -yunu form is not sufficient 'comment' to make up, with a topic
noun, a complete sentence. Thus *bayibulganyunu ['he used to be big']
is not an acceptable sentence; however:
(549) bayi bulganyunu margibin he has become skinny, from (being)
      fat
which also involves the derived verb margibil, is grammatical.
   The nominal affix -yunu must not be confused with ablative inflection
-yunu-see 6.1.5.
   [7] -bara ' a person or animal who is concerned with - J ; often ' who
comes f r o m - ' or 'who lives at or o n - \ See also 9.1.2. -bora can be
suffixed to nouns, most often to nouns referring to places. Thus from
gambil 'tableland' is derived gambilbara 'person from the tableland'
(i.e. a member of the more northerly of the two hordes of the Dyirbalrjan
tribe). The writer was referred to as bayi landanbara' a person who comes
from London'; and see (105). Sometimes -bara can be suffixed to an
adjective: guyimbara 'murderer' from guyi 'dead' (however, -bara
cannot be suffixed to a noun and to an adjective qualifying the noun).
There is also yalamaynbara ' thing or state which is like this one' from
yalamay 'do it like that';
(550) yalamaynbaragu yayguna yuguygu balgan a stick similar to that
      one hit me
6.1 Morphology of nouns and adjectives                                          225(551) yalamaynbara bani/balgun you can come like that, naked (i.e.
      it doesn't matter about clothes)
yalamaynbara is used as a noun in (550), and as an adjective in (551).
The form is yalamaynbara in both D and M, even though the M form corre-
sponding to D yalamay is yalabay.
   A -bara form always functions as a noun, -bara is the only nominal affix that
can form part of a noun root, e.g. balan wabubara M * dingo' (cf. bala wabu
'scrub*), balan ganibara DG 'dingo' (cf. gani 'a long way'); bala cjawunbara
G * English bee* (cf. bala fawun 'dilly bag') - see 9.1.2.
   [8] -yam 'is like a - ' . -yarn can be suffixed to a noun, the resulting
form functioning as an adjective, e.g. ya^ayaru '[looks] like a man',
gugulayaru ' [dives] like a platypus':
(552) baygun d,ugumbiiu yayguna ya^ayarugu balgan the woman that
      looks like a man hit me
(553) bayi ya^a gugulayaru mulmajiu the man dives like a platypus
And see text xxxib, line 15 (p. 384).
   A -yaru form may be the complete 'comment' in a sentence-see
(107).
   -yaru may modify a multi-word NP which then functions as an
adjective phrase modifying a head noun, e.g. bayi yaya djugumbilyaru
midiyaru 'the man is like a little woman'. In the case of a sentence like
bayi ya^a yaygu damanyaru 'the man is like my son', -yaru is usually
suffixed to the head of the modifying phrase, although it is possible
but less acceptable to have, say, bayiya^a yayguyaru daman 'the man
is like my son', with -yaru suffixed to yaygu. We could also have bayi
yaya yayguyaru 'the man is like someone of mine'. However, it appears
that -yaru cannot in this case occur with both words in the modifying
phrase; thus mbayi ya%a yayguyaru damanyaru is not an acceptable
Dyirbal sentence.
Kerr [1968: 21-2] mentions that Nyigina has a suffix -yaru * resemble, be like'.
Note that Nyigina has a number of other forms that resemble Dyirbal words
and suffixes in both form and meaning, e.g. gijia 'that one' (see 6.5.3).
   [9] -badjun ' r e a l l y - ' or ' v e r y - ' . This suffix does not change the
syntactic function of a word to which it is attached.
   -badfUn is most commonly suffixed to adjectives; here it can be glossed
''very' - bulganbad,un 'very big'. It can also be suffixed to nouns,
indicating that the noun is indeed a proper description of its referent,
226                                  6.1 Morphology of nouns and adjectivese.g. balan banabad,un 'proper water (i.e. with no impurities)', bayi
wayalbadjUn 'a proper boomerang (i.e. made from the correct sort of
wood)'; bayiyaiabad,un 'a proper man (i.e. he is beyond doubt a man
and not a woman)'. -bad,un can also be suffixed to noun markers,
attracting attention to the referent of the noun, e.g. bayimbaa^un 'he's
the one (e.g. that I was telling you about)'; balanbadjun d,ugumbil ^anapu
'a whole lot of women are standing there'. A topic noun plus -badjUn
can make up a complete sentence - as in (104).
          can also be suffixed to time words - 6.4.
A form bad,un occurs in Wargamay, most typically following yujia 'he', with
the meaning * that's the one'. It is likely that the Dyirbal/Wargamay affix is
cognate with Gugu-Yimidir -bu$un 'very, extremely* [Roth, 1901a: 25;
Haviland, forthcoming] and Gugu-Yalanji -bad,agu ' very' [H. Hershberger and
Pike, 1970: 802].   [10] -bapa comparative; occurs predominantly with adjectives,
although it can qualify a noun, e.g. ya^aba^a 'more of a man'.
   The function of -ba^a is best understood by studying its occurrence
in texts. First (text xxxix) a conversation between J (a speaker of G)
and G (an M speaker):(554) J: ...garifyn                 budin

the original owner of water, and of the other animals' attempts to find

the kangaroo turns to a small mouse and asks:
(556) rjindajyinda midibaia\ baygul gulu buyan
      [how about] you? You are smaller [than us], and will not be
      seen by him
   In each example the object of comparison is not explicitly mentioned
in the comparative sentence; it is, however, quite clear what the object
of comparison is from the preceding sentences and/or from the situational
context (we thus have a classic example of ' contextual correlations' -
Dixon, 1965). If a comparative sentence is given to an informant in
isolation there is likely to be ambiguity. Thus:
(557) balan djugumbil baygul yafaygu midibaiagu balgan
could mean 'the smaller man hit the woman', midibaiagu being taken
as part of the ergative NP; or else as 'the man hit the woman with
a smaller [stick]', where midibaiagu is taken to be in instrumental case.
   If an explicit comparison is needed (that is, if there has been no
previous mention of the object of comparison) the following form is
likely:
(558) ya^a bulganbaxa bayi midid,ilu I'm bigger [than him]; he's
       really small
or else:
(559) ya4a bulganbaxa bayi midiba^a I'm bigger [than him]; he's
       smaller [than me]
However:
(560) bayi bulgan yad,a bulganba%a he's big; [but] I'm bigger
may also be used.
                                                                   8-2
228                                  6.1 Morphology of nouns and adjectives   A sentence may, in an appropriate textual context, consist of just
a topic noun or pronoun and a -bapa form (as yinda midibaia in (556)).
Note the contrast between:
(561) bayi bulganbaia he's bigger [than someone else]
and:
(562) bayi bulgan apd,a he's bigger [than he used to be]
   -ba^a also occurs as a comparative with time qualifiers (6.4) and
bound forms bayd,i etc. (6.5.7).
   [11] -gabun 'another-'. The addition of this suffix does not change
the syntactic function of a word; -gabun can be suffixed to a noun or
to an adjective. For example:(563) bayi yaya jiinajtu/bayi yayagabun waypdjin one man is sitting
      down, and another man is going uphill-gabun thus marks reference to a further token of the same type. Not
infrequently, -gabun is affixed to EACH token of a certain type :(564) bayi ya^agabun pinapu/bayi yayagabun waypfyn           ( = (563))   From the adjective wura 'little, small' is derived the very common
Dyirbal form wurawuragabunda ' quite a considerable amount (literally:
at more than a little)':(565) balan djUgumbil palygirgan wurawuragabunda          woman is certainly
      very good-looking
and (text xxxia: 3):
(566) walawalaygu bayi wurawuragabunda he certainly danced shake-
      a-leg style well
wurawuragabunda is always a sentence qualifier. (An alternative would be to
consider it as submodifier to an adjective, in certain constructions; the fact
that wurawuragabunda cannot take any further inflection shows this analysis
to be incorrect.)   -gabun plus locative inflection can also be involved in time expressions
- 6.4. -gabun occurs with particle -rjuri- 4.15.3.
   [12] -d,aran ' t w o - ' or 'each of t w o - ' . This suffix can be attached
to a noun or an adjective and involves no change in syntactic function.
Thus:

(568) -cjaran, like all stem-forming affixes, is in fixed position following
ya[a> as part of the noun stem ya^a^aran. Note that -d,aran can be
affixed to either noun marker or noun but not both; thus we can have:(571) bayia]aran bayguy balay jiinajiu      two frogs are sitting there
or:
(572) bayi bayguyd,aran balay pinajiu       ( = (571))
but not:
#
    (573) bayia]aran bayguyd^aran balay jiinajiu
However, -a]aran can be affixed to both noun and adjective:(574) bayi yaiad,aran midirfaran banipu       two small men are coming   In (567-70) the affix -d,aran appears to be synonymous with number
adjective bulay(i). In fact, although there is some overlap in meaning,
-d,aran frequently has a ' distributive' sense, contrasting with the simple
enumeration of bulay(i). Thus, in M :(575) balan bupba bulayi maiudjOranba two swamps, each with mud
(576) bayi bulayi ya^a yirmagabund[aran wurbapu two men, each
      speaking two (different) languages [i.e. there are in all four
      languages known](The use of -gabun in (576) is similar to that in (564).) The contrast
between bulayi and -d,aran is highlighted by the use of -d,aran as an
affix to the number yuygul 'one', as in bayugarayu yuyguitar an 'the
two [people] have one each' (literally 'belonging to the two people,
one each'). See also text xv, line 62 (p. 379) mala^aranda bulay 'two
pieces, one in each hand'.
230                                  6.i   Morphology of nouns and adjectivesbula occurs as the number adjective 'two', and (gu)Dara(n) as a dual affix, in
many Australian languages; in other languages the functions are reversed -
see 1.6.
   [13] -mumbay 'all (and only) t h e - ' . This suffix can be attached to
a noun or adjective and involves no change in syntactic function. Thus:
(577) bayi ya^amumbay banijiu all [of a certain community of] men
      are coming
In spontaneous conversation one woman asked another whether she
had told the writer the Dyirbal names of all the fishes {bayi d,abu
'fish'; wandjay 'call a name'; text reference ix: 6):
(578) yindama 4aP4a wantfapu d,abumumbay have you called the
      names of all the fishes?
-mumbay can be given a deep representation in terms of set inclusion (as in
5.10). Thus [Nouns-rawwfory, VC] implies that 'Nouns' refers to some 'natural'
set of objects S; and that for every member, x, of S [Nounx, VC] holds, where
Noun x has reference x.
  [14] -gara 'one of a pair' (cf. balagara, 3.3.2). -gara can be added to
certain nouns, and involves no change in function. It is most commonly
used with proper nouns and indicates that the person referred to is
one of two people involved in a general set of events, -gara can also be
used with some kinship terms, indicating two of a type. Thus balan
yabundigara refers to two mothers (say, the two mothers of two men
mentioned earlier in the discourse). An example of -gara with a proper
noun:(579) burbulagara banijm Burbula and another person are coming
Both of the pair may be specified, each with a -gara suffix:
(580) burbulagara badibadigara banipu Burbula, being one of a pair,
      and Badibadi, being the other of the pair, are coming
  -gara effectively functions as a coordinator within an NP - see also
4.2.1, 5.10.2. Thus, if one wanted to say that both a kangaroo and
a wallaby were speared, one could either [i] use a -gara construction:
(581) yad,a bayi yupgara bayi bargangara tyirgajiu I speared kangaroo
      and wallaby
or [ii] repeat the verb:
(582) yaa\a bayiyup cjurgajiufajKJa yatfa bayi bargan djurgajiu\bulayimban
6.1   Morphology of nouns and adjectives                                231Here ajid^a marks a new topic, and the verbalised number adjective
bulayimban ' do twice' emphasises that the action is repeated.
  A -gara NP can function equally well as actor:(583) yayguna yayagaragu djUgumbilgaragu djilwan man and woman
      kicked meWhen confronted with the ungrammatical sentence
^(584) yayguna yazaygu fagumbixu (jilzoan
an informant said that the only way to attach any sense to it was to assume
that the kicker was a person half-man and half-woman.  [15] -maygan 'one of many' (cf. balamaygan, 3.3.2). -maygan is
exactly analogous to -gara except that it refers to one amongst many,
not to one amongst two. Several of the people in a crowd can be
specified, each with suffix -maygan:(585) burbulamaygan badibadimaygan banijiu        many people, including
      Burbula and Badibadi, are coming   An underlying set representation for -gara and -maygan sentences
was discussed in 5.10.2.
   [16] -djilu DGy -d,u M. This is an intensifier that can be suffixed to
nouns, adjectives and noun markers, without any change in syntactic
function; it can be attached either to a head noun in an NP, or to its
noun marker, but not to both. -djilu cannot be given any overall single
English gloss; it can sometimes be taken to carry 'reflexive meaning'
(cf. 4.8.1, 6.5.6), e.g. bayindjilu ya^a 'the man himself and, in M
(text xxv, line 58, p. 392):(586) balanq]u yambayambarijm buyali        she kept thinking about going
      down [there] herselfIn other instances a form like yaxadflu can mean 'man on his own'.
  -djilu occurs very frequently, and examination of some of its occur-
rences in the texts that are given at the end of the book will give some
idea of its use as an intensifier.
   -djilu also occurs with pronouns (carrying a reflexive meaning), with
time words (6.4), verb markers (6.5.6), with particles such as biri and
d,amu (4.15.3), and with interjections: yimba ' n o ' , yimbad,ilu 'certainly
not, no indeed', and d,uru ' I don't know', djurud,ilu ' I definitely do not
know' (4.17).
232                                  6.1 Morphology of nouns and adjectivesO'Grady et al. [1966: 133] mention that in Wadjuk there is a suffix -cfil with
* assertive reference'; there is a chance that this may be cognate with Dyirbal
-tylu*
   [17] -gayul 'the same-' has complex syntactic function which
includes its functioning as a stem-forming nominal affix, -gayul is
discussed in 6.1.4.
   [18] bound forms -baya]i etc. and -gait etc. (3.2.3). These fifteen
bound forms function mainly as suffixes to noun and verb markers.
Some of them can also, far less commonly, occur as stem-forming
nominal affixes, e.g. bala bigupgalugalu 'very long fingernails' from bala
biguji 'fingernails' and -galu 'out in front' (text xxxib, line 15, p. 384).
And:
(587) bayi banijm dirjgaldayi he's coming with his head held very high
(588) bayi banipu diygalbaya^i he's coming with his head held very
       low
(589) bayi banipu diygalgalu he's coming with his head bent down
       (to charge)
See also diradayi 'point up' in text xv, line 53 (p. 377). A common
Dyirbal expression for 'upside down' is munudayi from bala munu
'arse, bottom'.
   Of the fifteen forms in 3.2.3 only bayd,i, dayi, galu, gala and gali
have been elicited functioning as stem-forming affixes; only dayi and
galu occur with this function in the corpus of texts. The bound forms
are commonly reduplicated when occurring with nouns whereas they
cannot be reduplicated when occurring with noun or verb markers.
   The difference between, for example, balagalu bigup and bala bigupgalu
is very important: roughly, the form in which galu is suffixed to the
noun marker, bala, indicates POSITION, i.e. that the fingernails are
way out in front; the form in which galu is suffixed to the noun, biguji,
indicates EXTENSION, i.e. that the fingernails stretch FROM here TO way
out in front.
   Participles function exactly like noun roots, taking the full range
of nominal affixes. Thus bayiyibiwadilwadilcfaran 'two woman-swivers'
and bayi mi^ayga pinaypinaybadjUn ' a man who really sits all the time
in camp'.","[243, 244, 245, 246, 247, 248, 249, 250, 251, 252, 253, 254, 255, 256]"
"6.4 Morphology of time qualifiers
Time qualifiers (3.5, 4.14) can take the following affixes:
   [1] -badjiin. As with nouns (6.1.1), this affix indicates 'certainty' (that
a particular event has happened or will happen at a particular time):
(639) gilu bayiyaya banijt man will come later on today
(640) gilubadjun bayiya^a baniji man is certain to come later on today
It appears that -badjun can occur with all time words.
   [2] -baia (see 6.1.1). As with nouns, -bapa has a comparative meaning;
thus d,ajid,arubaia refers to a time earlier than 4aJl4aru C3Ut s t ^l ' earlier
on today'); and giluba^a to a time later than gilu (but still 'later on
today'), -bapa can occur as an affix to words referring to past or to
future time but not to 4aP4a 'now'.
   [3] ""4^u DG, '4U M (see 6.1.1). This 'emphatic' affix is attested
with all time words. It appears to have much the same effect as -bapa;
the emphasis that 4ap4aru4^u carries implies that it refers to a time
earlier than 4ap4aru> e t c -
   [4] durational inflections: [a] -{rj)gu 'until'. This cannot occur with
past time words. The affix is -gu in some cases and -rjgu in others;
thus yulgagu 'until tomorrow', 4#dagu 'for a few days' but gilurjgu M,
gilugu D 'until later on today', -gu can also occur with 4afl4a ' n o w '
(in M at least) and adds some kind of emphasis; thus 4aJl4a bani
'come now' and d,ajid,agu bant 'you MUST come now'.
   -(y)gu, but not -mu, forms can be verbalised.
In 4.14 we gave examples of locational and nominal expressions that can have
a time meaning: yarjgn{n)bay4igu t next week', and yaygungagaragabunda ' next
month \ These plainly involve the ergative/instrumental inflection and suggest
that' time until' -{rj)gu might be historically related to the ergative/instrumental
rather than to the dative nominal inflection.
   [b] -mu ' since'; this occurs only with past time words - bandagaymu
'since many years ago', rjumburjgamu 'since yesterday', {-mu is com-
moner in D than in M; strictly speaking, it may be confined to the
D dialect.) -mu has semantic affinity with -yunu, used in a time sense
(cf. (548) in 6.1.1):
6.4 Morphology of time qualifiers                                      253(641) ban djUgumbil yapnbinj cfamiyunu gubilamu woman is slim, but
      was fat some years ago (literally: woman has become slim, from
      being fat some years ago)
-mu only occurs next to the root of a time qualifier. If any other affix
intervenes, the 'from' form is -yunu-thus bandagaymu but bandagay-
bayayunu. This suggests that -mu should be considered an allomorphic
variant of -yunu. In some cases an affix has been observed FOLLOWING
-mw-thus yudaygamubaia balay bayi jtinapu 'he's been sitting there
quite a while!'
   -mu or -yunu can often be omitted, the durational meaning still
being evident from the rest of the sentence. There are, however,
considerable complexities. Consider, in M {gala is 'earlier on today':)
(642) yaa]a yalay galabaya jiinajm I've been sitting here for hours
(643) yadja yalay jiinajiu galaba^ayunu I'm sitting here [for a rest
      because, say, I've been walking] for hours
A possible explanation of the difference between (642) and (643) is
that the underlying representation of (642) involves inflection -mu,
which is deleted by a 'performance-rule'; and that -yunu in (643) is
not a 'since' inflection but the stem-forming affix -yunu, as in (548).
   [5] affixes -ban and -a]ana (6.1.6) can occur with time words -
djajidjoban, giluban, gilurfana.
   Non-time words, often with nominal inflection -gabun 'another', can
be used in a locative inflection, with time reference. Thus bala q]agun ' a
sleep', and djagungabunda 'next night', as in (text xxxib, line 19, p. 385):
(644) bayum balan yuygugan a^agungabunda yad,a yamban then I heard
      another [Dambun spirit] the next night
Andgarimaia 'in the summer', garimalgabunda 'in the next summer';
birgiia ' in the wintertime', birgilgabunda; gagalumgabunda ' next month'
etc.
   There is also D yalamayprfa, M yalamaypd^ay 'at the same time'
(cf. yalamay in 3.4.4, and note that the M time form involves yalamay
even though the M verb isyalabay). Thus:
(645) yalamayjid,a yalidji yuban    we both put it down at the same time
and also (for -bu 'only' see 6.7.2):
(646) yalamayjid,abu yalia]i jiinajiu yalay it's the first time we've both
      sat here together (literally: 'the only same time')
  Time words also take affix -bi- 6.7.3.
254                                      6.5 Morphology of noun and verb markers6.5 Morphology of noun and verb markers
Morphologically there are three types of marker: [1] noun and verb
markers formed from root bala- (unmarked, and 'there'),yala- ('here'),
yala- ('unseen'), or from the interrogative root wujidjd- ('where');
[2] quasi noun and verb markers based on root gila- 'somewhere';
[3] demonstrative noun markers based on root gipa- DM, yijia G.6.5.1 bala-, yala-, gala- and wuji4a~ markers. At first sight there
appears to be a lack of congruence between the bala-jyala-jyala-
paradigm, and the wujia]a- paradigm (3.2.2, 3.4.5):
                               bala-forms
                                (class II)                    (class II)

                                                              • noun markers
      dative                     bagun            wujKJagun
      genitive                   barjun      allative (place)           balu             wujtcjaru
      allative (direction)       ball             wup4ari
      ablative                   barjum
                                                                  verb markers
      locative                   balayAt a glance the roots are ba- and wujia^a-. Ergative/instrumental, dative,
genitive and ablative forms appear to involve the same inflections. But
nominative is -la- in the case of ba- and zero for wujid,a-; the allatives
are -hi and -It with ba- and -ru and -ri with wujid,a-; and locative is
-lay with ba- but -y with wujiq\a-.
   The forms listed above are those that occur most frequently. But
there are variant bala- etc. forms that are heard only occasionally; these
are generally longer than the forms given above:
   normal forms               variants
        balan                                        nominative
        baygun                balavgun               ergative/instrumental
        bagun                 balagun                dative
        barjun                balayun                genitive
        balu                  balaru                 allative (place)
        bali                  balari                 allative (direction)
        bavum                 balatjum               ablative
        balay                    # #                 locative
(There are no variant wupcfa- forms.)
6.$ Morphology of noun and verb markers                                      255   There is a semantic difference between the two columns: the longer
forms imply an indefiniteness of locational specification. Thus balu ' to
there', implying some specific place, but balaru 'to some place or
other over there' (possibly also implying a circuitous route); and so on.
balayum is used in the first line of text xv and also of text xxv, to
indicate the indefinacy of origin of the main character in each story;
elsewhere in these two texts the form bayum is employed.
   This suggests that we recognise roots:
                        bala-y yala-> yala- and wujid,a-
and case inflections:
                noun markers                        verb markers
         nominative - zero                    allative (place) —ru
         ergative/instrumental —rjgu          allative (direction) —ri
         dative - -gu                         ablative - -yum
         genitive - -yu                       locative - -y
together with noun class endings (in the case of noun markers only):
          class I -/; class II -n; class III -m; class IV zero
   In the case of bala-, yala- and yala- markers there is elision and
consonant change:
   [i] -la- of the root drops before ergative/instrumental, dative,
genitive, allative and ablative inflections;
   [2] then, allative -ru and -ri become -lu and -It respectively.
  The normal situation is for rules [1] and [2] to apply. If they do
NOT apply 'indefinite' forms (that are many times less frequent than
the shorter, normal forms) result.
   If -la- were omitted from nominative and locative forms a word of
only one syllable would result; as we have already noted, all Dyirbal
words (except interjections ya and yu) have at least two syllables.
However, ban and bam do occur as variants of class II and III nominative
markers balan and balam (balan and ban, balam and bam are in free
variation; there is in this case no 'indefiniteness' attached to the
longer forms); bala and balay can not be shortened.
Allative -ru is probably related to the -ru that can be added to allative and
locative forms of nouns (3.4.6). It is significant that although we can have
balu mid,agu (' in the direction of the camp') and also balu mi4aguru, -ru cannot
be affixed to balu: *baluru mi4agu(ru). This is explainable under our hypothesis
that -ru is already included in balu. Rule [2] is similar to rules that are needed
to explain other phenomena in Dyirbal: intransitive roots barmiliy and balbaliy
256                                6.5 Morphology of noun and verb markersare certainly historically related to the reflexive (-riy) forms of barmil 'look
back' and balbal 'roll' (9.1.1).
   There is nowadays no affix -ri similar to -ru (but see d,ina 'foot' and $nari
'root under water' - 9.1.2).
   Verb marker inflection -yum, noun inflection -rjunu, and time qualifier
inflection -mu are quite possibly cognate, being derived from a single affix
in an earlier stage of Dyirbal.
   Our analysis of the noun and verb marker paradigms is also supported
on historical grounds, bala recurs in a number of other Australian
languages with a similar meaning and function to that which it has in
Dyirbal, but without such complex morphology.
For instance, Pitjantjatjara [Trudinger 1943: 212] has a form bala 'that
(definite, specified)'. In the Western Desert language [Douglas 1964: 72]
there are demonstratives referring to 'near', 'mid-distance' and 'far'; the
mid-distance form is given as balapa. O'Grady et al. [1966: 136-7] report
that Wanman shows none of the normal Australian pronouns, but has a pronoun
paradigm based on the root bara; this may possibly be cognate with Dyirbal
bala-. See also 6.5.3.6.5.2 gila- markers. In D and M (but not in G) there is a defective
marker paradigm based on the root gila- 'somewhere'. Thus there are
noun markers:
                 nomi-      ergative/
                 native   instrumental       dative     genitive
    class I       gila      gilaygul        gilagul     gilayul
    class II      gila      gilaygun        gilagun     gilayun
    class III     gila      gilaygum        gilagum
    class IV      gila      gilaygu         gilagu      gilayu
There are also verb markers:
                       allative of place     gilaru
                       allative of direction gilari
                       ablative              gilayum
                       locative              gila
Thus, gila- markers are morphologically exactly like bala- markers
EXCEPT THAT: [1] there is no -la- deletion; [2] all nominative forms are
simply gila, i.e. there is no class indication in this case; and [3] the
locative verb marker is also gila.
   An NP that includes a gila- marker may also include a bala- type
marker (or a gijia- type marker), gila- markers, like bala- markers, can
6.$ Morphology of noun and verb markers                                 257occur in NPs with interrogative wujid,a- markers. Thus we can have

also (text xxxia: 5):
(649) yugubaragira gila giyi yandaygu this yugubara spirit is bound
      to call out somewhere [around here, soon]
In (647) gila is a locative verb marker, agreeing with buybayga ' at the
swamp'; in (648)gilagun is a dative class II noun marker, agreeing with
wujia]agun 'to the class II object, which is where?', war^angu 'to the
boat', and galgayugu 'to that which had been left' (a relative clause
qualifying wara]angu); in (649) gila is a nominative class I noun marker,
agreeing with yugubara and giyi 'this class I object'.
  In G, locative forms of noun markers and (especially) demonstrative
markers are used where D and M would employ gila markers (see
next section).","[276, 277, 278, 279, 280, 281]"
"5.3.2 Universal syntactic relations. However, it appears to be a
universal fact that all languages have intransitive and transitive
sentences; that is, they have sentence types involving (in the discussion
below we leave aside all consideration of the order in which phrases
occur in sentences):(v) [NP S ) VC l n t r ]
(vi) [NP 0 ) VC t r , NP A ]We can refer to (v) and (vi) as underlying universal syntactic relations.
   These can be represented in several equivalent ways, so long as
appropriate conventions are stated. Thus, they could be written just
in terms of class labels:(vii) [NP, VC]
(viii) [NP, VC, NP]where it is understood that the NP in the binary deep relation (vii) has
(universal) syntactic function S, and that the first and second NPs in
the ternary relation (viii) have functions O and A respectively.
   Alternatively, the relations (v) and (vi) could be expressed just in
terms of functional labels S, O and A, and verb subclass labels T R and
INTR:(ix) [S, INTR]
(x) [ O , T R , A ]where it is understood that S, O and A are all realised by the class
NP, and so on. There are many other, entirely equivalent, ways of
writing (v) and (vi).
5.3   Underlying syntactic relations                                          139Note that in the case of (vii) and (viii) the convention must specify that the
three functives in (viii) are ordered. In the functional-label representation, on
the other hand, the convention need not specify ordering: O, A and TR can
be regarded as an unordered set in (x).
   There seems to be no linguistic advantage involved in choosing one
of these equivalent methods of representation over the others. We will
use the class-label representation below, simply because it is most like
contemporary TG conventions.
   In addition to the universal deep relations, (v) and (vi), we have the
universal hypothesis, discussed in 5.2.1, which claims that each natural
language is either strictly nominative-accusative, or strictly nominative-
ergative. Taking these in turn:
   [1] To say that a language is nominative-accusative is to claim that
it syntactically ' identifies' functions S and A. That is, S and A behave
identically under a number of syntactic transformations, etc. This can
be shown:
(xi)
                                 '      *        INTR                                                  TR
When we say that a language is of the 'nominative-accusative' type
we are making a claim about the syntax of the language, and are not
necessarily implying anything about its morphology (this, despite the
morphological overtones of the name 'nominative-accusative').
   Now in many nominative-accusative languages, S and A are marked
by the same case inflection - which is referred to as ' nominative' -
and O by a different inflection - called ' accusative'. This is the situation
in Latin. Case specifications can then be incorporated into the diagram:
(xii)                              ^
                                                   INTR
                           accusative       nominative
In nominative-accusative languages that lack case inflections, and
instead show syntactic function by word order, S and A may occur at
the same relative position in a sentence, and O at a different position.
140                                              5-3 Underlying syntactic relationsEnglish is basically of this type. Information about position can also
be incorporated into the diagram:
(xiii)
                                 ' S\                   INTR
   [2] To say that a language is nominative-ergative is to claim that it
syntactically 'identifies' functions S and O:
(xiv)
                                                   INTR
                                                        TR
If this syntactic identification is reflected in case marking, the inflection
that shows functions S and O is referred to as 'nominative case', and
that of A ' ergative case' :
(xv)
V
    '                                ' c '               INTR                                                          TR                        nominative           ergative
Similarly, nominative-ergative languages that lack case inflection may
have S and O occurring in the same relative position in word order,
and A in some different position.
   It should be noted that a language MAY have nominative-accusative
syntax without there being any morphological or word-order congruity
between S and A; similarly, in the case of a nominative-ergative
syntax, there being no necessary morphological or word-order congruity
between S and O. Dyirbal, for instance, has a nominative-ergative
syntax (that is, S is identified with O, for transformational operations)
but S and O pronouns are always morphologically distinct. There could
well be a language with three quite different case inflections (for NPs
of all types), marking S, O and A. Yet the language could still conform
to the universal hypothesis, in that it could SYNTACTICALLY identify
either S with A or S with O.
5.3   Underlying syntactic relations                                         141The discussion above takes no account of a third linguistic type mentioned by
Sapir [1917: 86], involving a distinction between pronominal forms of type
[A], marking transitive object and INACTIVE intransitive subject, and those of
type [B], marking transitive subject and ACTIVE transitive object; Sapir quotes
Dakota as an example of a language of this type. (Sapir's examples are also
mentioned by Fillmore [1968: 31-5].) It should be noted that Sapir's classi-
fication appears to be based primarily on morphological, rather than syntactic,
criteria; it is possible that detailed investigation of Dakota would show that
SYNTACTICALLY it does conform to the universal hypothesis.","[162, 163, 164, 165]"
"   Four of the birds etc. in the sample were said to have no call; two
only whistle. Nine make a rasping gutteral sound that would not
readily yield a form within the terms of Dyirbal phonology. The
remaining fifteen have a call on which a name could be based, but in
fact have a non-onomatopoeic name; for instance:                       name                                  call
      balan windan ' a yellow mountain bird'      tfdrurfdntfdn
      bayi gupur/gul * meat hawk'                    gi-gi-gi-gi
      bayi gay ambula * white cockatoo'            guruygdra-gdruygdra
Thus, of sixty-two birds, locusts and crickets, forty-seven could be
onomatopoeically named; thirty-two are.
g.4 Onomatopoeia                                                                 329Ten of the sixty-two names appear to be in reduplicated form; six of the ten refer
to birds that are onomatopoeically named, two to birds that have a suitable call
but are not onomatopoeically named, one to a bird with a gutteral cry on which a
name could not easily be based, and one to a bird with no call at all. It will be seen
that there is no particular correlation between reduplication and onomatopoeia.
   No attempt has been made to give an accurate transcription of the
imitations provided - these involve special voice qualities, lip positions,
tonal fluctuations and other para-linguistic characteristics. Each call
did appear to be clearly based on a form that obeyed the normal rules
of Dyirbal phonology, and it is this form that is transcribed here.
A call can be verbalised by adding -bay, thus the call of balan cjtwujtu
'kingfisher' was said as (fiwu, pronounced as one lengthened syllable
\djiu\ with shrill, breathy voice; the intransitive verb cfiwunbay '(to)
call djiwu1 shows no paralinguistic abnormalities and is pronounced
like any normal verb.
   One informant gave the call of the brown pigeon as gugwwua] - a
Dyirbal root cannot end in a stop, and the name of this bird is in fact
balan guguwu/i (another informant actually gave the call as guguwuji).
   In some cases the M and D dialects have different names for the
same bird; only one of these is onomatopoeic. Thus the M informant
gave the call of the brown pigeon as guguwup, although its name is
balan d,udjulu in M. In other cases the two dialects have variants of the
same, onomatopoeic name; for instance, a blue scrub pigeon is called
balan wangawa in D but balan wagawa in M - the D informant imitated
the call by [wdngawd] and the M informant by [wdgawd], the two
imitations being identical in all paralinguistic aspects.
There is an account of onomatopoeia in some Kimberley languages in Worms
[1938]; however, this should, like all Worms' work, be treated with caution.
   Only one of the Dyalrjuy names for the sixty-two birds etc. could
possibly be onomatopoeic. A black bird, balan tfawutfala in Guwal,
balan bud,ad,a in M Dyalrjuy, has a long and complex call, said by an
informant to be cjawurfala wupayburfala fjaygu wajidjU yarjum gugui
bujia]an djawu^ala wupayburfala.
fjaygu wap4u yarjum gugui bujid,an is 'who's been pulling up my young loya cane
from here'; wutaybudfala has no known meaning.
IO PrehistoryThis chapter attempts to do two things. Firstly, to examine lexical and
grammatical relationships between the dialects of Dyirbal and sur-
rounding dialects in an attempt to assess the genetic relationships of
the dialects and to reconstruct past tribal movement. Secondly, to
assess ways in which individual dialects of Dyirbal differ from the
general pattern of the language, with a view to internal reconstruction
of some aspects of past stages of Dyirbal.
   As mentioned in I . I , it seems likely that most Australian languages
(certainly, all those outside Arnhem Land and the Barkly Tableland)
are genetically related; we can call this a 'weak genetic relation*. In
this chapter we are interested in whether a pair of languages are
'strongly genetically related' -that is, whether they can be related to
a common ancestor that is considerably less ancient than proto-
Australian. If two languages belong to the same 'branch' or 'subgroup*
of a family then they are said to be 'strongly related'; if they are
members of different branches then they are 'weakly related'. Consider
an Indo-European analogy: Welsh is strongly related to Breton and
Cornish, and (slightly less strongly) to Irish, within the Celtic branch
of Indo-European; it is only weakly related to languages such as
Lithuanian, English and Greek.
   In the discussion below we will use 'genetic relationship' to mean
'strong genetic relationship'. Thus we conclude that Dyirbal and
Yidin, the language next to the north, are probably not genetically
related; that is, to connect them on the 'family tree' of Australian
languages one would probably have to pass through proto-Australian,
at the apex. On the other hand, Dyirbal may well be genetically related
to Wargamay, its southerly neighbour - that is, the common ancestor
of these two languages may be a latter-day descendant of proto-
Australian. It must always be borne in mind that over and above the
(strong) genetic relationships that are discussed below, all Australian
languages will probably in time be shown to be weakly genetically
related.

IO.I   Lexical diffusion in Australia                                331
10. i Lexical diffusion in Australia
Recent archaeological work suggests that aborigines have been in
Australia for something of the order of 25,000 to 30,000 years. The
people are essentially nomadic, and it is likely that there has been
considerable movement of tribes during this period. A tribe may have
split into two and the parts moved in different directions; one of them
might have merged with a further tribe (when numbers were reduced
due to famine, say), and this new tribe could have then split, and so
on (see Birdsell, 1958, and 10.2.2 below). This pattern of split, move-
ment and merger has almost certainly been responsible for a great
deal of lexical and grammatical diffusion throughout the continent.
   A rather striking feature of Australian languages is their apparently
high rate of vocabulary replacement. An account of the vocabulary
of the tribe at the junction of the Murray and Darling Rivers, ninety
years ago, mentioned 'when anyone dies, named after anything, the
name of that thing is at once changed. For instance, the name for
water was changed nine times in about five years on account of the
death of eight men who bore the name of water. The reason is, the
name of the departed is never mentioned from a superstitious notion
that the spirit of the departed could immediately appear if mentioned
in any way' [Taplin, 1879, P- 23\- For something to be changed nine
times in five years is quite unusual, but there undoubtedly always has
been considerable vocabulary replacement, due to this taboo on any
common noun similar to a dead person's name, throughout Australia.
The new noun, to replace the proscribed one, is likely to be borrowed
from the dialect of a neighbouring tribe. (Some tribes, such as the
Walbiri in Central Australia and the Tiwi on Bathurst and Melville
Islands, have several alternative names for some common objects; one
name will be the most frequently used, but if this should be proscribed
then one of the other ' reserve' terms will at once replace it; however,
this type of synonymy is quite absent from other regions - from the
Cape York peninsula, for example.) Thus, if a tribe splits into two and
the newly-formed tribes move so that they are separated by four or
five other tribes, their vocabularies will quickly diverge; as words
become taboo in each of the sister dialects they will be replaced with
items from neighbouring dialects.
   If the two dialects have been contiguous for a long enough time,
they will have about 50% vocabulary in common. That is, if two
332                                    IO.I Lexical diffusion in Australiadialects move into contiguity and, at the beginning have no (or very
little) vocabulary in common, then-through borrowing from each
other to replace proscribed items - the percentage of common vocabulary
will build up until it levels off at about 50%. On the other hand, if
a tribe splits into two and the two new tribes remain in contiguity,
then they will at first have almost identical vocabularies; as different
words become taboo at different times in the two sister dialects, and
are replaced from neighbouring dialects, the percentage of common
vocabulary will gradually decrease until it levels off at about 50%.
    The way in which vocabulary is lost and gained can be illustrated
from a hypothetical (and somewhat oversimplified) example. Suppose
that in a narrow coastal strip, bounded by the sea to one side and
a mountain range to the other, there are five dialects: from north to
south, A, B, C, D and E. Suppose that each dialect has 50% vocabulary
in common with the dialect to its north, and also with the dialect to
its south; except that C has only 20% vocabulary in common with B.
Suppose that in T years each dialect replaces 1 % of its total vocabulary,
by borrowing from its neighbours; suppose also that each dialect
borrows equally (or almost equally) frequently from north and south.
Now of the 1 % lost by C one-fifth will be vocabulary that was in
common with B; similarly for the 1 % lost by B. But of the 1 % gained
by C, about half is likely to be borrowed from B; and, similarly, for
the 1 % gained by B. Thus, after T years the vocabulary in common
to B and C will be 20 — 0-2 — o-z + 0-5 + 0-5 = 20-6%. But for C and D
half the proscribed vocabulary will be material that was common to
C and D; and half the gain will be new common vocabulary; after
T years C and D's common material will be 50 — 0-5 — 0-5 + 0-5 + 0-5 =
50%. The percentage of vocabulary shared by B and C has increased,
and will continue to increase until it reaches about 50%; the percentage
shared by C and D, being already at the stable 50% level, does not alter.
    Consider now the other case: suppose that each dialect shares 50%
with its neighbours save for B and C, which this time share 70%.
After T years B and C will now share 70 — 0*7 — 0-7+ 0-5+ 0-5 = 69-6%;
and the vocabulary shared by these two dialects will continue to drop
until it is about fifty percent.
   We have thus suggested that the equilibrium figure for vocabulary
shared by neighbouring dialects is 50%, and that after any two tribes
have been in contiguity, as distinct tribal groups, for a sufficient period
they will stabilise at about this figure.
IO.I     Lexical diffusion in Australia                                             333
It could be argued that a language is not likely to borrow equally frequently
from each direction. For instance, if C shares a certain word with D, and the
item is proscribed in C, then C presumably MUST borrow from B. Thus it
would seem that if C has a higher percentage of vocabulary in common with
D than with B, then it is likely to bojrrow rather more often from B than from
D. It will be worthwhile to look at the mathematics of this borrowing situation
in some detail (continuing with the coastal strip example):
   Let pu be the fraction of vocabulary shared by languages I and J - that is,
pu = 0-4 indicates that I and J have 40 % vocabulary in common, and so on.
Now C will have 1— pbc of its vocabulary DIFFERENT from B, and 1— pcd
                                                                           1
DIFFERENT from D. There is thus the expectation of (1 — pbe)/(i — pbc+ — Pcd)
and that any new item borrowed by C will come from B, and the expectation
of (1 — pcd)^1 ~Pbc+ 1 ~Pcd) that it will come from D.
   Consider the case in which B and C each replace r % of their vocabulary,
over a certain period of time. B will lose r x pbc of the vocabulary it has in
common with C, and C will lose an identical amount (note that pbc = pcb).
Thus the total loss of common vocabulary will be 2r x pbc.
   Of the r% of vocabulary gain by B, r x (1 — pbc)/(2 — pbc — pab) will be
borrowed from C; and of the gain by C r x (1 — pbc)/(2 — pbc — pcd) will be
borrowed from B. The total gain in common vocabulary will be the sum of
these two figures.
   Thus the 'net gain' in the fraction of the vocabulary of B and C which is
common to the two languages can be formulated as total gain minus total
loss, i.e.:
                Net Gain =        /             1              2pbc\
                              100
                                  \i 1 T ~ P a b ! 1 I ~ P c d       I
                                   \      I — Pbc     I — Pbc     /And the fraction of vocabulary common to B and C after the replacement of
r % of the words in each language will be pbc + Net Gain.
   Now if each dialect has 50 % vocabulary in common with its neighbours,
except for B and C, which have 20%, the formula predicts that after 1 % of
the vocabulary has been replaced in each language, B and C will have 20-82 %
in common. And if each pair have 50 % common vocabulary except for B and
C who have 70%, the B-C figure after a 1 % replacement will be 69-35%.
Comparing these figures with those given above, we see that the percentages
will move towards the equilibrium level of 50 % rather more quickly if borrowing
is 'weighted* than if each dialect borrows equally from all its neighbours.
   Let us suppose that pab = pcd = m. For each particular value of m there
is a value of pbc such that the Net Gain is zero. The figures are, approximately:              m            o-o     0-2       0-4    0-5     o-6       o-8    0-9
       pbc for zero gain   0-37   0-42      0-48    0-5    0-55       0-65   0-70That is, if all other dialects have 20 % vocabulary in common, and if B and C
have 42 % in common, then a small degree of lexical replacement (say 1 %)
would be likely to leave the B-C figure unchanged. This would not, however,
334                                               IO.i Lexical diffusion in Australia
be a stable situation, since the A-B and C-D figures would increase rapidly
from a 20 % level, and as they rose so the * equilibrium figure' for pbc would
(as can be seen from the table) approach the equilibrium figure of 50 % more
and more closely. If the system of dialects were unaltered for a sufficient
period (that is, if there were no further tribal split or merger, and no external
cultural contact), the figures for all contiguous dialect pairs would eventually
even out at around 50 %.","[352, 353, 354, 355, 356, 357, 358]"
"
7.6 A morphophonological rule
As described in 3.2.1, there are a number of alternate realisations of
the ergative inflection, depending on the final segment of the nominal
stem:
   [1] -gil with a stem of three or more syllables, ending in a vowel;
   [2] -ygti with a disyllabic stem, ending in a vowel;
   [3] a homorganic stop plus -ti after a nasal or -y;
   [4] -r^> with deletion of the stem-final consonant, in the case of
a stem ending in -/, -r, or -^.
  We take the canonical form of the ergative affix to be -gu\ it is
j.6   A morphophonological rule                                                     289
simply this that is involved in case [i]. In case [2] a nasal is inserted
by process [1] and assimilated to the following consonant by process
[2] of 7.5.1. For case [3] the first segment of the case affix is regressively
assimilated to the preceding consonant segment:                        [Stop]          [Stop] / [ x J
                        LLbaJwhere x ranges over the features of the localisation system.
   In case [4] we can suggest that a bundle is formed consisting of the
manner feature of the stem-final consonant, and the localisation feature
of the affix-initial segment:
                       [Liql [Stop]                    [Liq]
                       | _ x j LLbaJ                   LLbaJ
                   stem     ergative
                              affix
   The complex alternations involved in the ergative inflections are thus
explained entirely naturally in terms of the phonological feature analysis
of 7.1. Note that this explanation depends upon recognition of a feature
common to y, ji and d,\ and (more controversially) one common to jrThe canonical form of the ergative inflection is thus identical with that of the
dative affix, -gu. But whereas dative -gu is relatively immutable (allowing the
insertion of -n- only in limited circumstances and then no assimilation - 7.5.1),
ergative -gu readily accepts an inserted nasal and assimilates it, or is itself
assimilated to a preceding segment.
   Other phonological phenomena, that are not dealt with here, include: the
retention of stem-final -y or -/ before some verbal affixes and loss before
others; the apparent replacement of stem-final -y by -n in some cases (this
could of course be said to involve insertion of -n-, by process [1], and then
elision of -y- to avoid an impossible sequence *-yn-)\ the fact that the -tjdy
inflection is -nay on to a -y stem, with loss of stem-final -yy as against -t)dy
with retention of -/ in the case of an -I stem; the fact that the genitive inflection
on pronouns is -yd to a disyllabic and -nd to a longer root.
7.7 r and /
There is some evidence that when, by linguistic change, a root plus
affix takes on the status of an unanalysable root, then an / in the new
root may correspond to r in the original affix. The evidence is:
290                                                              7-7    'r'and'V
   [i] there are forms bdlbaliy 'roll' and bdrmiliy 'look back' which
are exact intransitive analogues of transitive bdlbal and bar mil (9.1.1).
bdlbal and bdrmil do not have reflexive forms: if these did exist they
would be expected to be bdlbayiriy, bdrmiyiriy in D, bdlbariy, bdrmiriy
in M and G. We can posit that roots bdlbaliy\ bdrmiliy have been
formed from stems bdlbariyy bdrmiriy by the substitution of li for ri
in each case.
   [2] we posited underlying roots bdla and ydla for verb markers, and
suggested that bdlu, ydlu are derived from bdlaru, ydlaru by the deletion
of -la- and substitution of -/- for -r- (6.5.1).
   [3] we also mentioned the possibility that bound forms ddwulu,
bdlbulu are formed from ddwu + ru, bdlbu + rii, with -/- substituting
for -r- (6.5.7).
   [4] bala mdialu * hollow log, shirt* is probably etymologically related
to bala m&ia 'hole' (see 9.1.2), and possibly through the ubiquitous
locational affix -rti 'along, through', with substitution of -/- for -r-.
   Note that the -rii involved in [2] and [4] is the 'motion' affix
mentioned in 3.4.6; the -ru in [3] is the universal affix of 6.7.1.
   The change from -r- to -/- would be an entirely natural one; both
involve feature [Liq] - the change involves the substitution of unmarked
localisation feature [Lin] for marked feature [Lfr].
There is one instance of an alternation between r and d in the present-day
language. When occurring with bound forms bdyd,i etc. the universal affix has
the form -rii in D, -gii in some dialects of M, and -ndil in other M dialects
and probably in Ngadyan (3.2.3, 6.7.1). Thus ydluddyiru~ydluddyigu~ydlu-
ddyindu. In normal speech bdlarubdwal was said by the main D informant
as \bdlarubd:T\y but when said very slowly, in teaching Dyirbal to the writer,
it was [bd-ld-dii-bd-zvdl]. Commenting on the difference, the informant said that
dii became rii when * said quickly' (i.e. in a normal stream of speech). The under-
lying affix can be taken as -dd, this appearing as -rii in ordinary D speech through
some as yet insufficiently understood alternation between d and r, and as -ndti
in the more northerly dialects, the n being inserted before the stop by process
[1] of 7.5.1 (this process normally inserts n only before stops, not before liquids).
   That the underlying representation of at least some occurrences of r is
d, is not inconsistent with the phonological description given in this chapter.
Note that d and / share the same localisation feature, [Lin]. Thus, there could

Word order is exceptionally free in Dyirbal. There are two types of
restriction on order:
   [A] certain particles must precede the verb - 4.15.3.
   [B] in sentences involving iteration of the favourite construction,
the verbs of the succeeding embedded 2's serve as foci for order
restrictions: a word dominated by a lower-sentence node S n must
generally occur before the verb of S n + 1 where 2 n + 1 is dominated by S n
   However, there is a most frequent order; the preferences include:
   [I] time qualifiers tend to precede all other words;
   [2] some particles precede all but time qualifiers; other particles
prefer to occur immediately before the verb (see the list in 4.15.3);
   [3] a [ +actor] pronominal NP will precede any other NP;
   [4] nominative NPs precede ergative and dative NPs;
   [5] ergative NPs precede the verb;
   [6] dative NPs follow the verb;
   [7] verb markers and locational nominals follow the verb;
   [8] a noun marker precedes its noun;
   [9] adjectives follow nouns;
   [10] adverbals precede verbs;
   [II] a relative clause follows the noun it qualifies;
   [12] a possessive phrase precedes the noun it qualifies;
   [13] a demonstrative noun marker comes first in an NP.
However, any or all of these ' preferences' can be ignored in a particular
sentence. Words are not only free within phrases, they can occur in
any order in a sentence (subject only to restrictions [A] and [B] above
- see (321)). It is even quite common for an implicated VC to precede
the VC (with tense-inflected verb) of a higher verb; thus (cf. (78)):
(680) bayi           yafa       biligu     d,ir)galijiu
      THERE-NOM-I man-NOM climb-PURP run-PREs/PAST
      man runs [to tree] to climb [it]
The relative ordering 'preferences* listed above are more likely to be
adhered to if ambiguity would otherwise result.
Note that within a participle the order is fixed —' object noun' must precede
the verb root - cf. [4-5] above.
8 SemanticsA full account of the semantics of Dyirbal would be considerably more
lengthy than the description of the grammar and phonology, in chapters
3-7. In this chapter we refer briefly to some of the main points of
Dyirbal semantics, paying attention to aspects that reinforce and help
to explain parts of the syntax. A complete account of the semantics, in
the form of a comprehensive dictionary-thesaurus of the language, is
in active preparation. A provisional statement of verb semantics, going
into considerably more detail than is attempted here, will be found in
Dixon [1971].","[312, 313, 314, 315, 316]"

1.5 Pronoun
The standard Australian pronoun system involves a distinction between
singular, dual and plural forms in each person. A very few languages
appear to have a two-term system, lacking dual. There are rather more
exceptions in the other direction, where the addition of trial (or paucal)
forms makes for a four-term system.
The only languages known to the writer to lack duals are Maung, spoken on
Goulburn Island, N.T., and Dyabugay, spoken just to the north of Dyirbal in
the Cairns rain forest region. Languages involving trial pronouns include
Anincjilyaugwa and Nunggubuyu, from Eastern Arnhem Land; Worora [Love,
1931/2], Ngarinjin [Coate and Oates, 1970] and other languages from the
Kimberleys; some languages of Victoria [Mathews 1902, 19036, 1904; Hercus,
1966]; and Arabana in South Australia.
   Perhaps slightly more than half the languages of the continent show
an inclusive/exclusive distinction in first person non-singular pronouns.
In some languages there are different non-singular pronouns depending
on whether the two or more persons referred to belong to the same or
different alternate generation levels, and/or whether they are related
through male or female kinsmen, and so on.
  O'Grady et al. [1966: 104] report that in all 'languages in Western Australia
which are located south of the 22nd parallel of latitude, the inclusive/exclusive
distinction of the nonsingular first person pronouns, marked in the languages
to the north, is lacking'. Languages in other parts of the continent that lack
an inclusive/exclusive distinction include Kalkatungu [Blake, 1969: 39] and
6                                                                 1.5   Pronoun
Pittapitta [Roth, 1897] in north-west-central Queensland, and all the languages
to the south of Gugu-Yalanji (which itself has the distinction - R. Hershberger,
1964a) in the Cairns rain forest region and its hinterland. Hale [mimeo-a]
discusses kinship-determined pronouns in Lardil, Aranda and other languages;
see also O'Grady et al. [1966: 88, 130] and Strehlow [1944: 90 ff].
    Pronominal forms show a striking similarity over the whole continent.
We will use f) and iy for segments that are realised as lamino-dental
d and n in languages having two laminal series, and as laminal d, and
ji in languages with a single laminal series. Similarly, 1) and ff will be
used for segments that are realised as lamino-palatal/alveolar d, and p
in double-laminal languages and as laminal d, and ji in languages with
 a single series.
    The following forms usually function as transitive (and often also
 intransitive) subject:
    [1] First person singular: yaQu~yaQa~yayu~pay a. Forms with
 a stop and forms with a semi-vowel each occur in a variety of languages
 with wide geographical distribution; the same is true of forms ending
 in -a and those ending in -u.
    [2] First person dual {inclusive): yali occurs in an exceptionally large
 number of languages.
    [3] First person plural {exclusive): forms generally begin with yan-
 and end in a variety of ways.
    If there is no inclusive/exclusive distinction the dual and plural first
 person forms are generally yali and yan-. Where the distinction is
 made the inclusive plural form is often built on a root yaN- or ya£)-,
 while the yan- form has exclusive reference. However in Gugu-Yalanji
 [R. Hershberger, 1964a: 56] at least, the inclusive first person plural
 pronoun is yana. Where there is an inclusive/exclusive distinction the
 first person dual exclusive pronoun is not uncommonly formed by
 augmentation of the inclusive root yali.
    [4] Second person singular: There are a fair number of different
 forms occurring here and they are perhaps unlikely all to be genetically
 related. Initial parts are yind-~ yund-~ ffind-~ ffund-~ yind-~ yund-.
 The ending is almost always -a or -w, added to one of the six initial
 segments.
    [5] Second person dual: forms Nu{m)palu ~ Nu{m)pala occur widely.
    [6] Second person plural: ISfura ~yura occur in most western languages,
 and in some languages in other parts of the continent.
 Examples of actual pronominal forms in a number of languages are given in
 Dixon [forthcoming-b]; see also Schmidt [1912].
/•5 Pronoun                                                                  7
   In some eastern languages the first and second person singular
pronouns have three different forms, corresponding to the functions
intransitive subject, transitive subject and transitive object. Thus Gabi,
in south Queensland, has forms [Mathew 1910: 208]:
                           first person singular   second person singular
    intransitive subject           yay                     rjin
    transitive subject             yay4u                    yindu
    transitive object              rjana                   tjina
Only very rarely are there different forms for each of the three functional
slots in the case of non-singular pronouns in any language.
Gumbairjgar has one form for each of the three functional slots in the case
of all first and second person pronouns except first person dual inclusive and
second person singular - in these two cases one form functions as both
transitive and intransitive subject [Smythe, 1948/9: 38]. See also Blake and
Breen [1971] on Pittapitta.
  The transitive object form of pronouns is typically derived from the
unmarked subject form by the addition of -Na (examples are in Dixon,
forthcoming-b).
  Possessive pronouns are commonly formed by adding an affix to
the unmarked 'subject' form. A number of affixes are in competition,
each occurring in a variety of languages with wide geographical
distribution; amongst the most common are -gu, -t)uy -ya and -mba.
Languages whose possessive pronouns involve -gu include Wiradhari [Gunther.
1892: 67-8], and Western Desert [Douglas 1964: 73] in some incorporated
forms. Aranda, in which all words end in -a> has -ga [Strehlow, 1944: 91-2].
Note that Yulbaridja has -guzarju [O'Grady et al., 1966: 151]. -tju occurs in
Waluwara (on singular first and second person pronouns) and Nanda [O'Grady
etal., 1966: 122]. -rja is found in Gugu-Yalanji [R. Hershberger, 1964a: 56] and
on non-singular pronouns in Pittapitta [Roth, 1897: 6] and Yanyula. -mba occurs
in Pitjantjatjara [Trudinger, 1943: 210], and in Awabakal [Threlkeld, 1892: 17;
H. Hale, 1846: 488-90]. Non-singular possessive pronouns in Waluwara
involve -ma.
   In a number of languages there are dative pronominal forms, obtained
by adding an affix that is usually -gu to the subject form or to some
underlying root. Some languages also have other pronominal inflections
-allative, ablative, locative - often patterned on the noun paradigm;
however, many languages lack these peripheral cases as far as pronouns
are concerned.
Dative -gu is found in, for example, Walbiri, Awabakal [H. Hale, 1846:
488-90], Wanman, Yulbaridja and Bailko [O'Grady et al., 1966: 137, 151, 88].
8                                                                   1.5 PronounIn the West Torres Straits language dative pronouns involve suffix -kay and
are derived from the unmarked (intransitive subject) forms of singular pronouns,
but from the possessive forms of dual and plurals [Ray, 1907 a: 23; Klokeid,
personal communication].
   Third person pronouns are often set off morphologically and syn-
tactically from the first and second person forms. In some languages
third person pronouns inflect on the pattern of nouns, rather than of
other pronouns (for instance, Gumbaingar - Smythe, 1948/9: 38).
Third person pronouns often carry a demonstrative meaning, and
sometimes involve an obligatory specification of the proximity of the
object referred to.
In Thargari there are 'near', 'far' and 'remote' forms of the third person
singular pronoun [Klokeid, 1969: 17]. For the Western Desert language third
person pronouns occur in four forms 'near', 'mid-distant', 'distant' and 'not
visible' [Douglas, 1964: 47/8]. Roth [1897: 2] describes a slightly different
system for Pittapitta: there are three third person forms, indicating (a) proximity
to the speaker's front or side; (b) proximity to speaker's back; and (c) remote-
ness anywhere from speaker.
   Third person pronouns do not commonly distinguish sex, although this
does happen (for the singular pronoun) in a few languages - for instance,
Yanyula and Alawa [Sharpe, forthcoming]. Anindilyaugwa distinguishes sex
for almost all pronominal person and number combinations.
   There does not appear to be any third person singular pronoun form
which occurs in a fair number of languages with wide geographical
distribution. There are, however, frequently encountered regional
forms. Thus yuNa is found in many languages in Western Australia
[O'Grady et al., 1966]; pulu~jiula are found in a variety of languages
in the eastern half of the continent.
Languages in which pulu is found include Gugu-Yalanji [R. Hershberger,
1964a: 56] and Garzwa; jiula occurs in Bandjalang [Cunningham, 1969: 92/3J
and Warurju, immediately to the west of Dyirbal.","[29, 30, 31, 32]"

5.4 Tree representation of topic-chains
5.4.1 Motivation. We shall now give tree representations (so-called
P-markers) for Dyirbal sentences - see Chomsky [1965], McCawley
[1968]. These will incorporate generalisations that show and explain
syntactic functions, and the ways in which simple sentences can be
transformed, related together in topic-chains, and so on.
In English, syntactic function is shown by word order; in Dyirbal, word order
is remarkably free, syntactic function being shown by case inflection. Tree
representations normally provided for English sentences involve a rigid left-to-
right ordering of the branches. Now Staal [1967] has argued that in the case
of languages with free word order (his example is Sanskrit), it is appropriate
to use 'wild trees*, that do not involve ordering of branches but are defined
148                                    5-4   Tree representation of topic-chains
as * configurations of points such that there is one point at the top and each
other point is connected with one and only one point above it' [1967: 14]. He
thus has a first PS rule S = {NP, VP}, and so on. However, 'wild trees'
have at least one considerable drawback - if a certain node dominates two
nodes that have the same label, then it will be impossible to distinguish
between these latter two; the tree will be ambiguous. That is, in the case of
a wild tree involving:
(xxxv)                                 A                                   B   C Bfor instance, it would be impossible to compare the two instances of B between
two examples of the same structure. This could only be done by introducing
intermediate labels between A and B, for instance:
(xxxvi)
                                        A                                  D C E
But the introduction of these labels would be exactly equivalent to the intro-
duction of a left-to-right ordering convention, with D corresponding to 'to
the left of C and E to 'to the right of C \ We shall, in fact, want to work in
terms of configurations such as (xxxv) (and we shall employ ordered trees).
   Staal's wild trees were presumably intended to generate the words of a
sentence in any order. However, what they would in fact do is generate the
words in any order within a phrase, and phrases in any order within a sentence.
We have seen that in Dyirbal words can occur in any order within a sentence,
irrespective of phrase membership (cf. (321)). Thus, even if wild trees were
used for Dyirbal we would still need a ' scrambling rule' that mixed the words
from different phrases.
   It is sometimes denied that any language has such a thing as free word order.
In fact Dyirbal is an example of a living language with an order that is totally
free, with the exception of certain particles and cases of multiple embedding.
That is, any order of words CAN occur (although, of course, every possible
order does not occur with equal frequency). But despite this, speakers are
definitely aware of a norm word order, to which they will more closely adhere
in elicitation than in conversation.
   It might be thought that, if ordered trees are appropriate for English, then
unordered trees, that involve case specification from the deepest stage on,
would be suitable for Dyirbal. (xxxv) would be unambiguous if the two
occurrences of B were marked by different cases. This would be a possible
procedure, but it would be unbearably long-winded and clumsy - the many
operations that trees can undergo would each have to be specified for a multi-
5.4   Tree representation of topic-chains                                       149plicity of case alterations. It is considerably simpler and more revealing to
state underlying syntactic relations in terms of configurations in ordered trees
(the ordering being chosen just to show these relations). Transformational
operations then change the configurations in various ways. Cases are assigned
by a late rule, in terms of the positions of NPs in the final configurations, after
the transformations have applied.
   Syntactic functions will be specified within trees in terms of domi-
nation, and of relative (left-to-right) ordering. There are a considerable
number of ways in which the nodes can be ordered, such that there is
sufficient relative ordering for unambiguous identification of syntactic
functions. There are no syntactic reasons for choosing one of these
ways over the others; we have in fact chosen the order that corresponds
most nearly to the underlying 'norm word order' in Dyirbal surface
structure (see 7.8). For instance, topic NPs are typically sentence-
initial; we adopt the convention that the topic NP is the leftmost NP
dominated by S.
The ordering we have imposed upon trees does not correspond IN EVERY
PARTICULAR to the norm order of words in sentences - for instance, we are
not able to show within a tree that a pronominal A NP is likely to precede
a topic NP. The correspondence could only be made exact through destroying
some important syntactic generalisation shown through trees. (Specification
of the exact order in which the phonological realisations of grammatical
categories occur is held to be a phonological matter, in the same way that
specification of morphological alternations is usually held to be a phonological
matter, and so on.)
   Thus, the output from the syntactic and phonological components is a
sentence in 'norm' word order. We could then postulate a 'scrambling rule'
that re-arranges the words in any order. However, it is likely that considerations
of discourse structuring (' given' and ' new', or ' focus', or ' theme' or whatever
-see Chomsky [1971], Halliday [1967-8], Dixon [1965], etc.) play some part
in determining the actual order of words in a discourse. A discourse-generating
component would thus act on the output from the language-general syntactic
and phonological components, forming a specific discourse appropriate to some
PARTICULAR extralinguistic situation.
   We have in this section taken account of point [1] from 5.1.","[171, 172, 173]"

5.9 Minimal sentences
Any Dyirbal utterance necessarily involves a 'topic' noun (which is in
nominative case) and some 'comment' on it. The comment can be
verbal as in all earlier discussion in this chapter, or it can be adjectival;
the types are exemplified in:
(514) bayi yaya yanu man is going
(515) bayiyaia bulgan man is big
The difference between these types can be seen by comparing (515)
with the verbal comment sentence:(516) bayiyaia bulganbin man has become big
  The difference between (515) and (516) is exactly paralleled by that
between (517) and (518):(517) bayi yapa bulgan wudjipu big boy grew up
(518) bayi ya^a bulganbin wud,ijiu boy grew up, becoming big
  The entire difference between (517) and (518), and between (515)
and (516), is that bulgan indicates a state of being (roughly, 'a nominal
quality'), whereas bulganbil indicates an activity ('a verbal quality').
The semantic difference can be brought out in the case of (517) and
(518) through tree representations:
206                                                     5.9   Minimal sentences(cxix)

                              bulganbil       ioud,iyrespectively.
   This suggests deep structures for (515) and (516):
(cxxi)
                                      T
                                          bulgan
5.9 Minimal sentences                                                      207and

                              yai>a
respectively.
   We are thus viewing (515) as a sentence that consists of JUST AN NP;
within the NP the noun is the topic and the adjective the comment.
Thus, if an NP contains an adjective and there is also a VP or embedded
2 in the sentence, then the adjective is part of the 'topic', as in (517).
However, if an NP contains an adjective and the NP is the sole con-
stituent of a sentence, then the adjective is the 'comment', as in (515).
   Support for the above analysis is provided by the occurrence of
gulu 'not* in sentences that do not involve a verb (see 4.15.3). In M,
(515) can be negated by placing gulu at the front of the sentence: gulu
bayi ya^a bulgan 'the man is not big'. If bulgan were dominated by the
node VP in (515), we would expect *bayi yaja gulu bulgan to be
grammatical; it is not.
   The three functions of ajiq]a (4.15.2) are [1] to introduce a new
topic; [2] to introduce a new type of verbal comment; and [3] to
introduce a new type of adjectival comment. A detailed examination
of the behaviour of ajid,a, and its semantic effect, thus provides support
for the analysis given here.
Any attempt to formulate a universal syntactic policy on adjectival modification
must set out with the recognition that the relation of 'big* to 'man' in 'the
big man is going' is the same as that in ' the man is big' (in Dyirbal, that the
relation of bulgan to yaxa in bayi yaxa bulgan yanu is the same as that in bayi
yaxa bulgan). There are then two main possibilities:
   [1] since 'the man is big* appears in some languages to involve a predication,
then adjectival predication is said to underlie 'the big man is going*. Thus
'adjectival comment' is regarded as a special type of 'verbal comment' [Lyons,
1966, after Chomsky, etc.].
   [2] since 'big' is an intra-NP modifier in 'the big man is going' it is also
syntactically this in ' the man is big'. This is the analysis adopted here.
   Languages vary in whether or not sentences which involve only adjectival
208                                                      5-9 Minimal sentences
comment are given tense qualification. For languages - such as Dyirbal - in
which they are not, analysis [2] is clearly preferable. The difference between
(515) and (516) is exactly expressed by the different syntactic statuses of the
comment in the two cases; and note that in addition to tense, bulganbil can
bear the full range of verbal affixes (6.3), whereas bulgan can bear only nominal
affixes. To adopt analysis [1] for Dyirbal would be needlessly to complicate
the description.
   In the case of languages that do provide tense qualification for adjectival
sentences there is little to choose between analyses [1] and [2]. If tense is
regarded as a feature applying to a complete sentence, not just to the VC, then
the fact that adjectival sentences are marked for tense is no argument for
regarding adjectives as 'a kind of verb \ If analysis [2] were applied to English,
the copula could be thought of as a * dummy' brought in to carry tense when
there is no verb available. (Russian provides support for this position -
adjectival comment sentences involve a copula only when referring to past or
future time; if the reference is to present time noun and adjective are sufficient.)   Minimal sentences involving a head noun, and a modifier noun with
some suitable affix, can be classed with noun-plus-adjective construc-
tions; -yaygay 'without' in (106), -bila 'with' in (525), and -yarn
'like a' in (107) serve to derive an adjectival stem from a noun root.
   Participles function exactly like adjectives. They can be regarded as
syntactically derived from relative clauses. Thus the surface repre-
sentation of the relative clause construction:(519) bayiyaja a]anayu man has been standingis:
(cxxiii)
5.9 Minimal sentences                                           209We can give the representation of the participial sentence:
(520) bayiyaia q^anay man habitually stands around
as:
(cxxiv)                            T
                                   NP'
                                         d,anayThus, to form a participial structure from a relative clause, cfanay
(and the VC node that dominates it) are detached from VP in S 2 and
attached to the node Adjfective].
   Similarly, in the case of an NP-incorporating participle (4.6); the
representation for :

                                   cfugumbil      buncjulThere are three important differences between (521) and (522): [1]
4ugumbil is in ergative case in (521) but bears no inflection in (522);
[2] djUgumbil can be accompanied by a noun marker in (521) but not
in (522); and [3] -yay must be affixed to bunfyd in (521) but can
optionally be omitted in (522). These differences are accounted for by
saying that baygun djUgumbiiu buntfulyayu is dominated by 2 in (cxxv),
whereas 4ugumbilbun($ul(yay)niuya is dominated by Adj WITHIN the
topic NP in (cxxvi).
In 5.5.2 we described possessive phrases in terms of relative clauses; in surface
representation a possessive NP was shown as still dominated by the relative
clause 2. An alternative would be to say that the possessive NP is transferred
to the Adj node, as in the case of a participle. There is in fact no syntactic
evidence favouring one of these alternatives over the other. (Note that a sentence
can involve just a noun plus relative clause, or just a noun plus adjective, or
just a noun plus possessive phrase - the latter could thus conceivably be
' identified' with either of the first two.)
  There is a further type of intra-NP comment, the demonstrative
noun marker, gi/ia-, as in (cf. (101):
(523) giyi bayiyaxa the man's here OR this is the man
for which a suitable tree representation would be:

                          giyi   One final constituent of an NP which has not been dealt with above
is a modifier noun, indicating inalienable possession-4.2.1. Such a
noun can be a comment (and can be qualified by an adjective, although
not by a noun marker). Thus:
(524) bayi yaya gagalumyunu guwu bulayi the man, from the moon,
      has two noses
Compare with the construction involving alienable possession:
(525) bayiya^a bayijiambila wayalbila the man has a boomerang
There are no nominal sentences (showing inalienable possession) of
the type 'the nose belongs to the man', similar to bayul yapayu bayi
wayal 'the boomerang belongs to the man', which involves alienable
possession.
   It thus seems appropriate to consider an inalienably possessed noun
as a further constituent of NP'. The underlying representation of

1.8 Interrogati ves
There is almost always an interrogative ('who') corresponding to the
pronoun class, and another ('what') for the noun class. The most
common form for the pronominal interrogative is yana, although wap(u)
and war a are both encountered in a fair number of languages. There
are two widely occurring * what' forms: miNa and yard.
Yukulta is the only language known in which one form, tjakay covers both
' who' and 'what'.
   There is a long discussion of interrogatives in Schmidt [1912], although it
must always be borne in mind that Schmidt was working with published
materials that were uneven in quality and in almost all cases phonetically
unreliable.
   Australian languages generally also have interrogative forms 'how
many' and 'when'. There is generally an interrogative root from which
'(at) where', 'to where' and 'from where' can be formed, by adding
appropriate case inflections. English 'why' would be translated by the
dative of 'what' (i.e. 'for what'). Some languages also have interrogative
verbs: 'do what/do how'.
18                                                  i.g   Particles and clitics1.9 Particles and clitics
Most languages have a score or so elements that modify the meaning
of a sentence, or have a coordinative or subordinative function. These
can take the form of non-inflecting particles - that have the status of
separate phonological words - or of enclitics - syllabic elements which
cannot take primary stress but which can be added to a noun, verb or
other word after the inflectional ending. Some languages express modal
and logical modification through a mixture of particles and clitics.
   Certain types of sentence modification recur from language to
language-'doubt', 'assertion of the definite truth of a sentence',
'probability', and so on; there is little similarity between the forms of
the clitics/particles through which the meanings are expressed. An
exception is the interrogative modifier, which converts a declarative
sentence into a polar question, and typically has the form -ma ~ -ba ~ -
mba.
Languages with an interrogative clitic include Pitjantjatjara with -mba [Tru-
dinger, 1943: 222], Pittapitta with -ba [Roth, 1897: 28] and Aranda with -ma
[Strehlow, 1944: 19].","[41, 42]"
"10.3.2 Verbal and nominal inflections. The discussion in this
section, which is largely concerned with inflectional variation between
dialects, is restricted to D, G and M.
   [1] General genitive inflection -mi on nouns and adjectives (3.2.1).
The fact that this case affix has a rather limited distribution - it does
not occur on noun markers or pronouns - suggests that it is a relatively
late development. It was probably introduced into the language after
noun markers had taken on their final, class indicator, segment (other-
wise, we would expect to encounter noun markers in -mi inflection).
Note that nominal -mi does occur in all dialects, suggesting that it
was probably introduced into proto-Dyirbal (language A of tree 1,
P- 341)-
    [2] Perfective relative clause inflection -mi (4.11.2). This affix occurs
only in M; it is added AFTER the unmarked tense inflection (whereas
relative clause -yu occurs INSTEAD of any tense inflection). This suggests
that verbal -mi is a very late development, perhaps being introduced
into Mamu after Mamu had split off from Dyirbal. (Note that verbal
 -mi does not occur in Gulqay, for example; but it is in Ngadyan - its
 presence in both Mamu and Ngadyan could be explained in terms of
 diffusion, in either direction.) The introduction of verbal -mi appears
io. j   Internal history of Dyirbal                                        355to involve generalisation from nominal -mi, on the analogy of nominal
and verbal -yu.
   [3] Verbal ending -ga (4.13.2). This occurs only in M. -ga is added
after the unmarked tense inflection, but (unlike -mi) a vowel, -u, is
added between an -/ conjugation tense form ending in -n, and -ga. We
thus have:
          unmarked tense
              form                -mi form            -ga form
             balgan              balganmi            balganuga
              wayjidjin          wayjifynmi          wayjidjinuga
             jiinajm             pinajiumi          jdnajiuga
It is important to enquire why the inserted vowel should be -u-. In
many Australian languages a vowel that is inserted - for phonological
felicity - is usually in some sort of harmony' with the previous vowel
in the word [Hale, mimeo-c]. Exactly this happens in Dyirbal in the
case of loan words, when the English item ends in a stop - the rule was
stated in 9.3.1. The fact that -u- is included before -ga, whatever the
last vowel in the verb stem is, suggests that the unmarked tense form,
at the time that -ga was introduced, was -nu in the case of the -/
conjugation. That is, we originally had balganu and zvayjicfinu, with the
-u being dropped in a recent phonological change.
The only other instance of a vowel intruding between a consonant and a suffix
involves the universal affix -ru, when following bawal; certainly in this case
the inserted vowel is identical to the previous vowel - bawalaru.
We are led to the position that, at some time in its history, Dyirbal
formed the unmarked, non-future tense by:
   [a] in the case of an -/ stem, replacing stem-final -/ by -nu, and
   [b] in the case of a -y stem, replacing stem-final -y by -jiu.
This could be formulated as a single rule, in terms of the phonological
features discussed in chapter 7. We can say that the unmarked tense
inflection involves a consonantal segment, specified only for the feature
 [Nas], and vowel segment -u. And that a new segment is formed from
the localisation choice of the stem-final segment, and the manner
choice of the affix-initial segment. That is:                          stem   tense
                                  affix
356                                       IO.J Internal history of Dyirbal where y ranges over the manner system, and x over the localisation
 system.
    The naturalness of this rule lends some plausibility to our suggestion.
 However, we still have to explain why the final -u should later be
 dropped from -nu, but not from -pu forms. There is a straightforward
 reason - the future tense inflection is -p on all stems; thus if non-future
jdnajiu were to lose its final segment, it would be indistinguishable
 from future jiinaji (in contrast, balganu became balgan, which still
 contrasted with the future form balgap).
    [4] Future tense inflection in D and M involves the replacement of
 stem-final -y or -/ by -p. In G, on the other hand, future inflection
 involves:
    [a] the addition of -d,ay to an -/ stem,
    [b] the addition of -n^ay, and loss of stem-final -yy in the case of
        a -y stem (3.4.3).
 It is possible that the longer G form is more archaic, and that the
 DM form has developed out of this. Note that if the final -ay were
 elided {rompinantfayy balgald,ayy we would get forms ending in d,. Now
 words in Dyirbal cannot terminate in a stop, and it would be perfectly
 natural to change -dj to -p. The -/ or -n before this final -p would have
 to drop, since no word can end in a consonant cluster.
    This suggestion is highly speculative. However, slight support is
 provided by the name guguwup, for a bird whose call was said to be
guguwudj-hexzp is substituted for word-final d, (9.4).
    A similar hypothesis can be put forward for the negative imperative
 alternation (4.12.2). The inflection is -m in D and M, with loss of
stem-final -/ or -y. In G it is -muy with loss of stem-final -y but retention
 of -/. We can suggest that the G form is nearer to the inflection in
 proto-Dyirbal, and that D and M have dropped the final -u (and then
necessarily lost -/ before -m to avoid a final consonant cluster).
We thus have the following likely changes:
    [a] roots such as bala and gipa take case inflections (this applies to
        all Dyirbal dialects),
    [b] noun class indicators are added after these inflections (again, in
        all dialects),
    [c] the appearance of general genitive case inflection -mi (all dia-
        lects),
    [d] future tense inflection -tfay reduced to -p (D and M only)
    [e] appearance of verbal inflection -ga (M only),
IO.J   Internal history of Dyirbal                                         357   [f] non-future tense inflection on -/ stems loses its final vowel (this
       change has taken place in all dialects),
   [g] the -mi inflection is generalised to verbs (M only).
   The discussion above has indicated certain orderings between these
changes: [b] must follow [a]; [c] must follow [b]; [f] must follow [e];
[f] must follow [d] (or there would be no bar to the loss of final vowel
from the unmarked tense inflection on -y stems); [g] must follow [f];
and [g] must follow [c].
   We can, rather speculatively, relate the changes to different ' stages'
in tree i, p. 341.

            (language C)
            Mamu
The fact that change [f] has applied in all dialects would have to be
dealt with in terms of diffusion. We can date [f] after [e], and [e]
appears to have taken place after the Dyirbal/Mamu split. However
[f] could have originated in any of the dialects (not necessarily Mamu)
and then spread to the others.
   It appears from the above discussion that G is more conservative
than either D or M. This would be expected in terms of the conclusion
in 10.2.5 ""~ G probably occupies the original tribal territory, and is in
contact with Wargamay, the Dyirbal group's longest-known neighbour.
It has thus been exposed to much less influence from other languages
than the more northerly dialects.
   G has not, however, remained static. Consider the addition of
a locative inflection to a noun marker - yagulga, gijianga - mentioned
in 6.5.3; this is an innovation unique to Giramay (and it plainly post-
dates change [b]).
We suggested change [a] on the evidence of other languages, which appear
not to inflect bala, gijia etc. forms. The change may have taken place in some
ancestor language of Dyirbal, or it may have been as late as proto-Dyirbal
(remembering that yala in Wargamay does not take the syntactic cases).
Change [b] can confidently be assigned to proto-Dyirbal. Change [c] may belong

in the same period, or it may have been somewhat later (after the original
tribe had split) and then have diffused into all dialects.
   All the remarks of this section are highly tentative, and subject to
revision when more is known of dialectal differences within the Dyirbal
language, and within neighbouring languages.","[378, 379, 380, 381, 382]"
"5.2.2 Syntactic identification in Dyirbal. Let us first recapitulate
the formation of topic-chains from simple sentences involving nouns:
   [1] A simple topic-chain involves the identification of the topic NP
in one simple sentence with the topic NP in the next; that is, we may
have S NP identified with O NP, O with S, S with S, or O with O.
Thus from:
(416) bayiyaia banijiu man came here
(417) bayiyaia baygun d,ugumbiiu balgan woman hit man
where the bayi yara in (416) and (417) have the same referent, can be
derived:
(418) bayi yara banipu baygun d/ugumbiru balgan man came here and
      was hit by woman
And from (417), (416) can be derived:
(419) bayi ya^a baygun djugumbiiu balgan banipu man was hit by
      woman and came here
Similarly in the case of two intransitive sentences with the same S NP,
or two transitive sentences with the same O NP.
   [2] If we have two simple sentences such that the topic (S or O)
NP of the first is identical with the A NP of the second, then the -yay
transformation must be applied to the second sentence before it can
be joined to the first in a topic-chain. Thus, from (416) and:
(420) balan djUgumbil baygul yaraygu balgan man hit woman
can be derived the favourite construction:
(421) bayi yara banipu bagun d,ugumbilgu balgalyapu man came here
      and hit woman
Similarly when the first sentence is transitive, with bayi yara the
ONP.
  [3] If we have two simple sentences such that the A NP - in ergative
5.2 Dyirbal as a nominative-ergative language                           131inflection - of the first is identical with the topic NP of the second,
then they can be joined in a -yura construction. Thus from (420) and
(416) can be derived:
(422) balan djUgumbil baygul yayaygu balgan {bayi yaya) baniyura        man
      hit woman and then immediately came here  We can now turn to sentences involving pronouns. [1] Consider:
(423) yaq]a banijm I came here
(424) yayguna baygun d,ugumbiiu balgan    woman hit me
which exactly correspond to (416-17), with ' I ' replacing 'man'. Note
that although bayi ya^a is in nominative case in both (416) and (417),
the pronoun takes the form yad,a in (423) and yayguna in (424). Now
a topic-chain can be formed from (423-4) exactly as it can from (416-17):(425) yadja banijm baygun djUgumbiiu balgan     I came here and was hit
      by womanSimilarly, from (424), (423):
(426) yayguna baygun q]ugumbiiu balgan banijtu     I was hit by woman
      and came here
It will be seen that the pronominal S NP in (423) is syntactically
identified with the pronominal O NP in (424), even though the pronoun
has a different form in the two NPs. The form of the pronominal topic
in such a topic-chain is the form it takes in the first underlying simple
sentence - thus in (425), with underlying sequence (423), (424), the
form is yad,a from (423); in (426), with underlying sequence (424),
(423), it is yayguna from (424).
   [2] Consider now two simple sentences, involving pronouns, such
that the S NP of the first is identical with the A NP of the second. For
instance, (423) and:
(427) yad,a balan d,ugumbil balgan   I hit woman
which exactly correspond to (416) and (420), again with ' I ' replacing
'man'. Note that the pronoun is in the same form in (423) and (427),
contrasting with the situation in the nominal sentences - ' man J is in
nominative inflection in (416) but in ergative in (420).
  However, despite the identity of form of the pronouns in (423) and
(427), a topic-chain can NOT be formed from these two sentences by
                                                                  5-2
132                          5- 2 Dyirbal as a nominative-ergative languagesimple coordination. That is, (428) is NOT a permissible Dyirbal
sentence:
^(428) yaa]a banijiu balan djUgumbil balgan
Instead, (423) and (427) must be joined by a favourite construction,
exactly as in the case of (416) and (420):
(429) yaq\a banijiu bagun djUgumbilgu balgalyajiu     I came here and hit
      woman
  A favourite construction must also be used to join two sentences,
when the ' identical NP' is in O function in the first and in A function
in the second, whether this identical NP is nominal or pronominal.
Thus, from:
(430) yayguna baygul gubiygu mundan the gubi took me
and (427), is derived:
(431) yayguna baygul gubiygu mundan bagun d,ugumbilgu balgalyajiu
      the gubi took me and I hit woman
  [3] Similarly, a topic-chain cannot be formed from (427) and (423)
by simple coordination. (432) is, like (428), quite ungrammatical:
^(432) yaa]a balan djUgumbil balgan banijiu
That is, (428) and (432) are ungrammatical in the sense in which r}ad,a is
taken to be in syntactic function to the second verb. An informant mentioned
that (428) could mean * I came here and someone hit the woman - not me';
(432) can, of course, mean * I hit the woman and she came here'.
  Instead, (427) and (423) must be joined by a -yura construction,
exactly as in the case of (420) and (416):
(433) Va4a balan djUgumbil balgan (yacfa) baniyura       I hit woman and
      then immediately came here
  Thus in FORM pronouns show a nominative-accusative patterning
but in FUNCTION they exhibit a nominative-ergative patterning, exactly
as do nominals. S and O pronouns have different forms but are
syntactically identified, exactly as are S and O nouns (that have the
same form). S and A pronouns have identical forms in D and M but
can NOT simply be identified, exactly as S and A nouns (with different
forms) can NOT simply be identified.
   This is further borne out by the verbal inflections in relative clauses.
5.2   Dyirbal as a nominative-ergative language                          133It was mentioned in 4.10 that a relative clause to a topic NP has verbal
inflection -yu, and a relative clause to an A NP (which is in ergative
case) has verbal inflection -yuru. Thus we have, with pronouns:
(434) yaa]a wayjidjiyu miyandapu I laughed as I went uphill
(435) yayguna wayjid,iyu baygul ya^aygu hup an man saw me going
      uphill
(436) yadjd wayjifyyuru balan q]ugumbil buyan I saw woman as I was
      going uphill
but not:*(437) Va4a wayp4iyuru vniyandayiu
And
(438) yaa]a wayjiq]iyu balan d,ugumbil buyan
could only mean ' I saw woman as SHE was going uphill\
  Similarly with possessive phrases - 4.11.
  With interrogative pronominal NPs we have (3.3.3):
(439) wajia bayi banijiu who [ = which man] came here?
(440) ban djUgumbil wajidjU balgan who hit the woman?
(441) wajiuna bay gun djUgumbiiu balgan who did the woman hit?
Then, from (439), (441):
(442) wajia bayi banijiu baygun djiigumbiiu balgan who came here and
      was hit by the woman?
From (439) and (440):
(443) wajia bayi banijiu bagun rfugumbilgu balgalyajtu     who came here
      and hit the woman?
From (441) and (439):
(444) wajiuna baygun djUgumbiiu balgan bayi banijiu who was hit by
      the woman and then came here?
From (440) and (439):
(445) wajiq]u ban djUgumbil balgan bayi baniyura       who hit the woman,
      and then immediately came here?","[154, 155, 156, 157]"
"6.1.2 Ordering of affixes. Some affixes appear to have fairly fixed
ordering qua root and case inflections. Thus -bara is only attested
immediately after a root; -gara and -marjgan appear to belong in the
6.1 Morphology of nouns and adjectives                                       233
next order, followed by -pa. At the other extreme, -d,ilu always
immediately precedes case inflections. The other aflixes occur between
-pa and -<jilu> but there is no fixed relative ordering; however, each
difference in ordering carries a semantic difference. Thus we can have
ya^agabun^aran 'two other men' and also yaiad,arangabun 'another
two men'; and bayi yaya wayald,aranbila ' man with two boomerangs'
as well as bayiyapa wayalbila^aran 'two men each with boomerang'.
   Investigation of ordering is hampered by the fact that Dyirbal words
seldom involve more than one nominal affix; the only combinations of
affixes that have been observed outside elicitation sessions are -gara + -pa,
-maygan + -pa, -d,aran + -bila, -bila + -d,aran + -d/ilu, -mumbay + -bila and
-bara + cjaran. It seems that each affix has its own individual potential
for combining with other affixes, so that no glib overall statement of
relative ordering is possible. (It is probable that only a native speaker,
who was trained as a linguist, would be able to give a full account of
this topic.)
   For instance, -yunu can occur with -d,aran in:
(590) giyi midindjaran yugarid^aranyunu those (are) two possums, out
      of two hollow logs (i.e. each out of its own hollow log)
but it cannot occur with -bila in:
*(59i) balan d,ugumbilgunabila midiyunubila banipu [woman is coming
      with child's faeces]
instead, we must say simply:
(592) balan (fyigumbil gunabila midiyunu banipu woman is coming with
      child's faeces
Combinations of affixes that have been elicited include (together with the
noun used): mi^agabunyunu 'from another camp', micfagabungabunyunu 'from
all the camps', gugulabacjunyaru 'like a real platypus', gambilbaragara 'a
person from the tableland, being one of a pair', bulganbacjunbila ' with a really
big (thing)', warjalmumbaybila 'with all the boomerangs', midibacjunyaygay
'without any really small (ones)', and in M midiba4un4arangabunba 'with
another two really small (ones)'.
  It appears that no other affix can occur with a bound form bayd,i etc.
functioning as nominal affix. We can have, for instance, bayi yaya
pumbulgalugalupumbulbila 'man has a long beard' (balapumbul 'beard')
but not *bayi yaya pumbulgalugalubila.

father will call this child yagi. Similarly a child will call its mother's
older brother mugu, and this uncle will in return refer to the nephew
or niece as mugu.
   There is an affix -d,ir which occurs with reciprocal kinship terms
and refers to two people who are in the reciprocal relation to each
other. Thus yagidjir 'maternal grandfather and grandchild', as in:
(593) bayindayi yagidjir banijm two people, one of whom is maternal
      grandfather of the other, a short way uphill are coming
It appears that there are only six or seven reciprocal kin terms that
can take the dual affix -(fir. They are:
  [1] bulu 'father's father'
  [2] babi ' father's mother'
  [3] yogi ' mother's father'
  [4] gumbu 'mother's mother'
  [5] bimu 'father's elder brother or sister'
  [6] mugu 'mother's elder brother'; and mugunan 'mother's elder
            sister' - the dual form is said to be mugud,ir in each case.
  The terms for a parent's younger siblings are not reciprocal, and do
not occur with -(fir. The forms used are:
                                         ego calls the    ego is called by
           relation to ego                 relative         the relative
      father and father's                   vuma              galbin
         younger brother
      father's younger sister              yalban             galbin
      mother and mother's                  yabu               daman
         younger sister
      mother's younger brother              gaya               damanThere are two further dual forms:
  [1] yumaygir - two people who are in yuma/galbin relation, e.g. a
      father and child (son or daughter)
  [2] ginagir - two people who are in yabujdaman relation
Note that while yumaygir is clearly related to yumay the suppletive
form gina is encountered - where yabu would be expected - in ginagir.
6.1 Morphology of nouns and adjectives                                           235
  There appear to be no dual forms referring to two people who are in
yalbanjgalbin or gaya/daman relation.
  Reduplication of the root part of a -d,ir or -gir dual implies inclusion
of more than one member of the younger generation in a pair. Thus
yagiyagidjir is 'a man, together with two or more of his daughter's
children', yumayumaygir is 'a man, together with two or more of his
own, or of his elder brother's, children'.
  The noun class of a -a]ir or -gir form depends on the sex of the
member of the OLDER generation; thus ginaginagir might refer to a
woman accompanied by her six sons, but would always take noun
marker balan.
  -d,irj-gir can be followed by some, but not all, nominal affixes, e.g.
yagidjirbila, yagidjirbadjun but not %yagid,ir^aran.
There is nothing unusual in an Australian language having kinship-determined
affixes; as mentioned in 1.5, a number of languages have several sets of pronouns,
depending on the relationship of the people referred to.6.1.4 gayul. -gayul occurs in D as a stem-forming affix only in stems
that receive a locational (allative, ablative or locative) case inflection:
mid,agayuia 'at the same camp', mid,agayulgu 'to the same camp',
miq]agayulyunu 'from the same camp'. A nominal-plus-£#yz// stem
cannot occur in a non-locational inflection in D; we cannot have, for
example :
*(594) yayguna baygul ya^agayufu balgan the same man hit me
   It appears that in M stems involving -gayul can receive ANY case
inflection; thus (594) is an acceptable sentence in M (and appears to
be synonymous with (595)).
  gayul also occurs in both D and M as a particle, to indicate that an
action is repeated with the same actor (if an intransitive action) or
actor and goal (if a transitive action):
(595) yayguna baygul y ayaygu gayul balgan the same man hit me again
(596) bayi gayul yaya banijiu the same man is coming again
As a particle gayul can occur anywhere before the verb.
  -gayul thus marks reference to the same token of the same type - it
contrasts with -gabun 'another', 6.1.1.
The behaviour of gayul tends to support the view that Dyirbal is gradually
getting more ' synthetic' (in terms of the general view that modern Australian
236                                   6.1   Morphology of nouns and adjectiveslanguages have evolved from an ancestor that was considerably less synthetic
- 1.12). gayul appears to be gradually acquiring the status of an affix, and
has moved further in this direction in M than in D.","[256, 257, 258, 259, 260]"

4.4 Implicated phrases
4.4.1 Implicated noun phrases. A simple sentence can be extended
by what we can call an ' implicated' NP; the words in such an NP are
in dative case (3.2.1, 3.2.2, 3.3.1):
(61) balanrfugumbilbaygul ya^aygu mundan man took woman
(62) balan d,ugumbil baygul yapaygu mundan bagum mirapgu man took
     woman to beans
This involves a third situational object ('beans') in the situational
event (which already involves 'man',' woman' and 'taking'). In contrast
to allative, which indicates just 'motion towards', a dative NP indicates
the expectation of implication of the beans (as goal) in some imminent
action involving the woman (as actor). Similarly, with an implicated
pronominal NP:
(63) balan djUgumbil baygul ya^aygu mundan yaygungu man took woman
     to me (sc. for her to do something to or for me)
  The possibilities for word inclusion in an implicated NP are exactly
the same as those for an NP whose words are in nominative or ergative
case.
  A simple sentence can, infrequently but unexceptionally, be extended
by more than one implicated NP - 4.5.4.4.4.2   -gay constructions. Any transitive simple sentence, such as:
(64) bayi bargan baygul yayaygu d,urgajiu man is spearing wallaby
(65) balan djugumbil baygul ya^aygu balgan man is hitting woman
can be transformed into a -yay form:
(66) bayi yaya baygul bargandu <%urganapu man is spearing wallaby
(67) bayi ya^a bay gun djiigumbiiu balgalyajiu man is hitting woman
Here, ergative is substituted for the nominative inflection of the NP in
O function, and nominative for the ergative inflection of the A NP.
The verbal stems are put into -yay form. This involves:
66                                                        4-4 Implicated phrases     for an -/ stem: the addition of -yay;
     for a -y stem: the deletion of stem-final -y, and addition of -nay.
  However, a sentence can also be transformed into a -yay form in
which dative is substituted for the nominative inflection of the NP in
O function:
(68) bayiyaja bagul bargangu d,urganajiu man is spearing wallaby
(69) bayiyaxa bagun q]ugumbilgu balgalyajiu man is hitting woman
   (64), (66) and (68), and (65), (67) and (69), have the same cognitive
meanings. In (64-5) the O NP is * topic' whereas in (66-9) the A NP
is topic, giving the sentences different statuses qua discourse patterning
- see 4.5. Sentences (64-5) show the preferred, unmarked construction
(they are referred to as * simple sentences' below); -yay constructions
normally only occur non-initially in a discourse, as demanded by the
structure of the discourse - 4.5.
   The difference between (66-7) and (68-9) is felt by speakers of
Dyirbal to be a crucial and important one; it cannot be brought out
through English glosses, but is explained in terms of the 'deep syntax'
of Dyirbal in 5.4. Roughly, in (66-7) the actor, goal and action make
up an event; (68-9) imply something more - that the actor is positively
implicating the goal in the event. The difference is essentially one of
topic.
   Similarly, involving pronouns, we have:(70) yad,a yinuna balgan I am hitting you
(71) yaq]a yinungu balgalyajiu I am hitting you
(70) is a simple sentence corresponding to (65). (71) corresponds to (69) - the
NP that was previously in O case is now in dative inflection, and the NP that
was previously in A case is now in S case (although the change is not observable
here, since in D the first person singular pronoun is va4a in both A and S
functions). There appears to be no pronominal sentence corresponding to
(67) - it would be mf)ad,a yinda balgalyajiu^ in terms of the rules explained in
chapter 5; such a sentence is totally unacceptable. A fuller discussion of the
behaviour of pronouns under the -yay transformation (in terms of which the
discussion of this paragraph will be more intelligible) is in 5.2, 5.8.2. This
behaviour is part of the evidence suggesting that pronouns have a nominative-
ergative underlying pattern.
   Constructions similar to the Dyirbal -yay type have not been reported for
languages in other parts of Australia; this may, however, be a reflection of the
relatively little attention that has been paid to syntax in studies of other languages.
Of the languages surrounding Dyirbal only Wargamay appears to have a
construction of this type.
4.4   Implicated phrases                                                        67   The actual shape of the -yay affix varies from dialect to dialect. After an
-/ root the affix is always -yay in M, either -tjay or -ay in D, and usually -ay
in G. That is, the -?j- is sometimes omitted in D and is very frequently omitted
in G. Bringing Wargamay [W] into the comparison we get the following forms
of the verb 'lift up, waken', in purposive inflection (4.4.3). Listing the dialects
in a roughly north-to-south order:
                               M    walmbilrjaygu
                               D    walmbil(rj)aygu
                               G    walmbilaygu
                               W    walmbilagii
Thus the W form differs from the G only in having no diphthongal -y- in the
penultimate syllable; on the surface, the W form appears to differ from the
G no more than the G does from the M.
   In D, G and M it is most appropriate to set up walmbil as the verb root, thus
showing that it belongs to the first conjugation (3.4.2); the -I is retained before
many affixes. W has two conjugations, exactly corresponding to those in
Dyirbal, and the root of walmbilagu again belongs to the first. But there is no
 ustification in W for setting up verb roots with a final consonant; instead, all
roots must be regarded as ending in a vowel and conjugation membership
must be stated in some other way. Thus the G and W forms, although similar
on the surface, have rather different analyses. In G the root is walmbil, the
transformation marker has underlying form -yay but becomes -ay by a dialect
rule which deletes the -rj, and the purposive inflection is -gu. In W the root is
walmbi-, the transformation marker has underlying form -la, and the purposive
inflection is again -gu. (And see 1.7.)4.4.3 Implicated verb complexes. Any NP whose words are in
nominative case (in a simple sentence, any S or O NP - but not an
A NP) can be identified as a 'topic' NP. Two consecutive sentences in
discourse are said to have a ' common topic' if they contain the same
topic NP, with the same situational referent: this NP will generally
only occur with the first sentence, not being repeated with the second
one. Thus from:(72) bayi yaja walmajtu man got up
(73) bayi yaya wayptfin man went uphill
is formed:(74) bayiyaia walmajtu waypd,in man got up [and then] went uphill  A common topic may be recognised in more than two (sometimes up
to twenty or so) consecutive sentences; such a sequence of sentences
will be referred to as a 'topic chain'.
  The second or succeeding VC in any topic chain may be marked as
                                                                          3-2
68                                                   4-4   Implicated phrases' implicated' by each verbal form in it receiving 'purposive inflection'
[Capell, 1956:77] in place of a tense inflection.The purposive inflection is:
                           for an -/ stem: -i
                           for a -y stem: -gu
(In the case of an -iy stem a phonological rule deletes stem-final -y,
7-5-2)
   The common 'implicative nature' of implicated NPs and implicated VCs
is discussed in 5.3.3-4.
   The action referred to by an implicated VC is only possible by
virtue of an event, referred to by a previous sentence of the discourse,
having taken place: EITHER the event has been performed as a necessary
preliminary to the intended 'implicated' action; OR the implicated
action is a natural (but perhaps unplanned) consequence of the event.
Thus:
(75) bayiyaia walmajm wayjtcftli man got up in order to go uphill
(76) yaq]a a]iygalijtu I am running
(77) Va4a bilijtu I am climbing [a tree]
(78) yad,a djiygalijm biligu I am running [to a tree] to climb [it]
(79) balan afugumbil baygul ya^aygu balgan man hits woman
(80) balan djugumbil badjijtu woman falls down
(81) balan djugumbil baygul ya^aygu balgan badjigu man hits woman,
      causing her to fall down
(82) bayiyaia wayjtdjinyalu man came uphill towards here
(83) bayi ya^a bay gun dunduygu mand,an bird points out man's
      presence (i.e. by making a noise, indicating that there is something
      large moving in the vicinity)
(84) bayi yara wayjtdjin yalu baygun dunduygu man^ali man came
      uphill towards here, resulting in bird's pointing out his presence
See text xxv, line 49 (p. 391) for a similar example.
(85) balam mirajt baygul yaray gu dimbajiu man brought beans
(86) yinda balam mirajt babin you scraped beans
(87) balam mirajt baygul ya^aygu dimbajiu yinda babili man brought
      beans so that you should scrape them
  It is in fact possible for the FIRST sentence in a topic chain to have an
implicated VC, although this happens relatively infrequently. In such
a case the necessary * implicating' earlier event has taken place but
has not been referred to in the discourse:
4*4 Implicated phrases                                                          69(88) balan djUgumbil miyandaygu woman wants to laugh (i.e. some-
      thing has happened to make her want to laugh, and she will have
      to restrain herself to avoid doing so)
(89) bayi yaya yanuli man has to go out (for some reason)   The next section discusses discourse structuring and topic chains
in more detail, and deals with the discourse function of -yay con-
structions. In fact any verbal stem can receive a purposive inflection
so that we can have, in addition to (65), (67) and (69):(90) balan djUgumbil baygul yapaygu balgali something happened to
      enable or force the man to hit the woman
(91) bayiyaia bagun (fyigumbilgu balgalyaygu (as (90))However we can NOT have:
#
    (92) bayiyaia bay gun d,ugumbiiu balgalyayguas we do have (67). Sentences of types (65), (67), (69), (90) and (91)
occur freely in texts; type (92) does not. Informants stated that (65),
(67), (90) and (91) were frequent and correct; that (69) was rather
unusual but quite correct; and that (92) was really lacking in any sense.
It appears that in view of the deep (i.e. semantic) import of an implicated
phrase it makes no sense to have a sentence whose VC is in -yay form
and implicated, but whose 'goal' NP is not in the dative inflection
(i.e. is not implicated); see 5.4.7.","[89, 90, 91, 92, 93]"
"
4.8 Reflexive and reciprocal constructions
4.8.1 Reflexives. A reflexive verbal form can be derived from any
transitive root as follows:
   [1] from an -/ root: delete root-final -/ and in M and G - add -riy;
       in D - add -yiriy, when next but one after a stressed syllable;
       add -riy in all other cases (i.e. when following a stressed syllable,
       or after two or more unstressed syllables);
   [2] from a -y root, in all dialects
       add -mdriy, to a root of two syllables;
       add -(m)bdriy, to a root of more than two syllables.
We thus have:                                               reflexive form
             transitive root           in M and G            in D
     buybal' hide'                     buybariy          btiybayiriy
     rjunbixal' try'                   ytinbirarfy      rjtinbixariy
     munumddal ' chuck it in'          milnuniddarfy     munumddayiriy
     guniy 'search'                              gunimdriy
     gunigiiniy ' repeatedly search'             gunigunibdriy
guniguniy is the reduplicated form of guniy — 6.3.4; ntunumadal is a compound
verb from munu 'arse J and madal ' throw', meaning 'give up some task' - the
form in G is muyumadal, corresponding to G muyu ' arse \  A reflexive form functions like an intransitive stem; that is, it can
co-occur in a VC with an intransitive, but not with a transitive, verb.
90                                 4-8 Reflexive and reciprocal constructions     Reflexive forms sometimes carry a reflexive meaning:
(215) bala yugu baygul yayaygu buyban man hides stick
(216) bayiyaya buybayiripu man hides himself
(217) balan d,ugumbil baygul ya^aygu yamban man hears woman
(218) bayi yaya yambayiripu man thinks
   In other cases, the reflexive affix appears just to derive an intransitive
from a transitive stem, without carrying any reflexive meaning:
(219) balam wudju baygul ya^aygu q]aygapu man eats fruit
(220) bayiyaia d,aygaymaripu bagum wua]ugu (as (219))
(221) yadjd bay i guy a wagajtu I am spearing fish
(222) yaq]a wagaymarijm bagul guyagu (as (221))
We will refer to sentences such as (220) and (222) as * false reflexives'.
   It appears that all verbs can form both true reflexives (if such forms
would be semantically plausible) and false reflexives.
  A true reflexive sentence must always involve verbal affix -riy (or
alternant); it can optionally include the nominal affix -(jilu, one of
whose functions is to indicate reflexivity (see 6.1.1). -q]ilu is particularly
useful to distinguish a true from a false reflexive. For instance, (220)
might well be shortened by the omission of bagum wudjugu and of
(223) bayi rfaygaymaripu he eats
Since people do not eat themselves, the unmarked interpretation of
(223) would be that it is a false reflexive, referring to the eating of
a regular meal. If one did want to refer to a man chewing his finger,
say (as a contemplative accompaniment, not in hunger), one would
be sure to include -dfiu:
(224) bayindjilu a]aygaymaripu he eats himself
  Consider a further pair of true and false reflexives, involving the
same verb, walmbil' waken, get u p ' :
(225) ydd,a walmbiyiripu I am getting up
(226) yaq]a walmbiyiripu bagul ya%agu I get (or will get) man up
The true reflexive (225) can be extended by an implicative NP, in the
same way that an intransitive simple sentence can be:(227) yafa walmbiyiripu bagulya^agu        I am getting up to be concerned
      with man (e.g. to see man)
4,8 Reflexive and reciprocal constructions                                      91(227) could be distinguished from the false reflexive (226) by the
inclusion of -djilu:
(228) ya^adjilu walmbiyirijtu bagul yafagu       (as (227))
   A false reflexive is very like a -yay construction. It appears to have
much the same syntactic purpose - to put an A NP (which is in ergative
inflection in the underlying simple sentence) into nominative case, so
that it can be incorporated into a topic-chain. The examples of false
reflexives given above have involved nominative substituting for the
ergative inflection of the A NP, and dative substituting for the nominative
case of the O NP. There are also reflexive sentences similar to the
other type of -yay construction, in which the O NP is put into ergative,
not dative, case:
(229) balabawal yugu baygul nudin he's cutting trees out there
(230) bayi nudiyirijm yuguygu baygubawal <as (229))
   False reflexives are, in fact, syntactically identical with -yay con-
structions; they differ from them in meaning. A verb in -yay form,
plus unmarked tense inflection, refers to an ACTUAL action; one in
reflexive form, plus unmarked tense inflection, refers to the POTENTIALITY
of some action taking place (see the discussion of actual/potential in
3.1). Thus:
(231) bayi ya^a d^abandu wagaymarijm man is spearing eels
refers to a man who has gone out on an eel-spearing expedition, but is
not actually spearing any at the moment. He may have already found
some eels, and have speared them all, and now be looking for more; or
he may not yet have found any at all. In contrast:
(232) bayiyaia d,abandu waganajm man is spearing eels
means that he has just found some eels, and is at present spearing
them.
   Similarly, bayi wugayirijtu bagum djigagu means 'he gives out ciga-
rettes ' - the Dyirbal verb has an ' habituative' meaning in this instance,
exactly like 'gives' in the English gloss. In contrast, bayi wugalyajtu
bagum 4igagu would mean 'he is (now) giving out cigarettes'.
The casual listener to Dyirbal conversation might conclude that some verbs
'prefer' -yay constructions, while others occur more commonly in false
reflexive form. In fact, all verbs can occur in both types of construction and
are governed by considerations of * actual' and ' potential' meaning, as described
above. The impression of 'preferences' is a result of the contrasting natures
92                                   4-8 Reflexive and reciprocal constructionsof different types of action. For instance, on a spearing expedition one spends
a great deal of time (sometimes, all the time!) looking for eels, and a relatively
short time actually trying to spear them - thus wagay ' spear' is heard much more
frequently in false reflexive than in -rjay form. In contrast, if one goes out to
cut a tree down, one spends virtually all the time actually hacking away at it
- it is not surprising that nudil ' cuty is heard much more frequently in -rjay
than in false reflexive form.
   The following sentence, which was given spontaneously by an informant,
includes both false reflexive and -rjay forms of the same verb:
(233) r)a4a bayi buxan rfaygaymariyu guyagu 4ayganayu
Verbal inflection -yu marks a relative clause-4.10. The literal translation of
(233) is ' I saw him, who is potentially eating fish, who is [in fact] actually
eating it'. That is, 4aVSaymarivu implies that the man referred to has caught
or acquired some fish and that he is either about to eat it or has eaten it;
d,arjganar)u is then more specific, and states that the man was actually eating
fish at the time I saw him. As the informant explained it in English: 'he is
having a feed of fish, when I saw him he was still eating it \
   We can have reflexive-plus-j;#ra constructions, exactly like the -yay-
plus-yura type (4.5.5):
(234) balan d,ugumbil baygul yajaygu balgan (bayi yaya) buybayiriyura
       man hit woman and then immediately hid himself
   Participles can be formed from reflexive verbs. For example:
   [1] nagay is a transitive verb i break the bank of a river, make a
landslide'; bala daygil is 'riverbank'. A part of a bank that is always
breaking down might be referred to as bala daygil nagaymarimuya,
   [2] yambal is the verb 'hear, listen'. Anyone who thinks a lot, or
anyone who listens intently to others, can be described as yambayirimuya
- in the first meaning the participle is derived from a true reflexive, in
the second from a false reflexive. Thus, of a man who is far from home
and is always thinking of returning, we might say:
(235) bayi ya^a yambayirimuya bayi banagaji man is always thinking
       that he will return home4.8.2. Reciprocals. A reciprocal verbal form, that also functions like
an intransitive stem, can be derived from any transitive root by:
[1] reduplicating the root (verb reduplication in Dyirbal involves
repeating the first two syllables - 6.3.4); a n ^ [2] adding -(n)bariy.
  The topic NP of a reciprocal sentence must have more than one
(animate, usually human) referent:
(236) balagara bayiyaya a^urgaya^urgaybarijiu the two men are spearing
      each other
4*8 Reflexive and reciprocal constructions                                     93(237) balagara jtund,aljiunq]alnbarijiu the two people are kissing
(238) balagara rfaymbalcjaymbalbaripu bufoiyga the two people met
      each other half-way
  A reciprocal sentence implies that one person was subject for one
instance of an action and the other object; and that their roles were

(239) bayiyaia baygun djugumbiiu baian woman punched man
(240) balan a]ugumbil baygul yayaygu ba%an man punched woman

Almost all Australian languages have reflexive and reciprocal verbal affixes —
reflexive often involves -rit see 1. 7. Compare with Thargari, which has reflexive
-ri and reciprocal with main allomorph -dbari [Klokeid 1969; 35-7].","[113, 114, 115, 116, 117]"

1.7 Verb
Just as the major parts of speech - noun, verb and adjective - have
mutually exclusive membership, so the transitive and intransitive sub-
classes of verb are mutually exclusive. That is, each verbal root is
clearly marked for transitivity, in terms of the case inflections of the
noun phrases that can occur with it. In the case of incorporating
languages the marking extends to the number and type of obligatory
pronominal affixes. And just as there are wide possibilities of derivation
between the major parts of speech, so there are a number of ways in
which a transitive stem can be derived from an intransitive verb root,
and vice versa; these are always clearly marked morphologically.
   For almost all Australian languages a number of distinct verbal
conjugations must be recognised. The number of conjugations mentioned
in the literature varies from two to about seven; in many cases, though,
only some of these are productive, the remainder being small closed
classes of what can be regarded as irregular verbs. Two conjugational
subtypes can be identified between languages of wide geographical
separation [Hale, 1970: 760].
   The first type is characterised by the occurrence of a liquid - / or
sometimes x - in its paradigm; depending on the analysis appropriate
to the language, the liquid will be recognised either as the final segment
of the verb roots belonging to this conjugation, or else as the initial
segment of some of the affixial allomorphs. The second type can be
recognised through the occurrence of either y or zero in place of the
liquid. Verbs in the first conjugation are predominantly transitive, and
in the second intransitive; there are nearly always some exceptions -
one or two transitive verbs that belong to the second conjugation, and
14                                                                  I.J Verbusually a slightly larger number of intransitive verbs in the first
conjugation.
For instance, Klokeid recognises five conjugations for Thargari [1969: 30-5].
Two are open classes and correspond to the types mentioned above: what is
called the * -Ru' conjugation - with predominantly transitive members - is
clearly the first type; Klokeid's '-a' conjugation - all of whose listed members,
bar one, are intransitive - is the second type. The other three conjugations
cover the irregular verbs of the language; they are closed classes with from
two to fourteen members.
   Of the six Nyangumarda conjugations recognised in O'Grady's classic study
[1970], three have open membership, while the other three, which contain
only five verbs in all, could be said to deal with the irregularities. Conjugation
I, more than 90 % of whose members are intransitive, is clearly of our second
type; conjugations II and III, both predominantly transitive, appear to be
sub varieties of the first (liquid) type.
   Hale [mimeo-b] recognises three conjugations for Walbiri. Two - which
each have slightly different paradigms for monosyllabic and polysyllabic verbs —
are open classes, and clearly correspond to the two conjugational types. Hale's
third conjugation has just three monomorphemic members.
   There are two conjugations in Gugu-Yalanji — verbs belonging to the first
conjugation can be assigned roots ending in -/, and those of the second roots
ending in -ay or -i. The -/ conjugation is predominantly transitive and the
-y/i conjugation predominantly intransitive. (Cf R. Hershberger, 1964&.)
   4.4.2, below, contrasts verbal forms in the Giramay dialect of Dyirbal with
those in the contiguous language Wargamay. Giramay and Wargamay are
conjugationally similar; a difference is that whereas verbs in Giramay can be
assigned roots that end in -I (conjugation 1) or -y (conjugation 2), roots in
Wargamay (although distributed between two conjugations in an identical
manner) cannot be assigned this final consonant. Thus there are cognate
transitive roots Giramay walmbil and Wargamay walmbi * raise up'; and the
morphologically and syntactically identical forms Giramay walmbilaygu and
Wargamay walmbilagu segment as walmbil-ay-gu and as walmbi-la-gu respectively
(~ay~-la is a * reserve passive' affix; -gu is * purposive' inflection).
   In most Australian languages the verb is morphologically and
morphophonologically the most complex part of speech. However,
there appears, on the surface at least, to be a little less interlanguage
similarity as regards verb affixes than there is for nouns and pronouns.
   A number of languages have three tense inflections - past, present
and future. There are, however, languages with two-term tense systems:
either past/non-past or future/non-future. There are also languages
with more than three tenses-in these cases remote past may be
distinguished from immediate past, and so on. In some languages
verbal inflections can also mark aspect (covering perfect/imperfect and
also such concepts as habitual, iterative, durative, etc.) and mood. The
i.7 Verb                                                                     15
interrelation of tense, aspect and mood can result in extremely complex
paradigms.
Lardil has a two-term tense system: future/non-future. In contrast, Gunwinggu
distinguishes only past and non-past; there is an obligatory aspect choice
within past, resulting in three inflections - non-past, past completive and past
continuous [Oates, 1964: 46]. In Mabuiag, a dialect of the West Torres Straits
language, Klokeid [1970: 3] recognises distinct inflections, in the declarative
mood, for remote past, near past, yesterday, last night, immediate past/present,
immediate future/present, near future, and remote future; he notes that fewer,
if any, tense distinctions are made in the negative, imperative and other moods,
and in the imperfective and other aspects. Compare with Wiradhari which
appears to have ten pure tenses [H. Hale, 1846: 494]. Nyangumarda [O'Grady,
1970] and Aranda [Strehlow, 1944] provide examples of complex paradigms,
involving the intersection of tense, aspect and other systems.
  There are languages in which information regarding tense is shown
not by inflection of a verb, but by an additional 'auxiliary' element in
the sentence. Thus in Ngarinjin the auxiliary, which follows the verb,
carries number, tense, mood and aspect [Coate and Oates, 1970: 54].
There are ten auxiliary roots, and each verb always occurs with a
particular auxiliary (the ten classes into which auxiliaries divide verbs
are thus a similar phenomenon to noun or gender classes).
Gunwinggu is similar to Ngarinjin, but here the auxiliaries appear to have
been incorporated into the verb as suffixes [Oates, 1964: 36-41]. See also
Sharpe [forthcoming] on Alawa. In Walbiri, tense, mood and aspect are
represented discontinuously in a sentence, by elements in an auxiliary word
and by suffixes to the verb word; unlike in Ngarinjin and Gunwinggu, the
Walbiri auxiliary does not establish verb classes [Hale, mimeo-b].
   Imperative verbs in Australian languages generally have rather wide
syntactic possibilities. They can be used with second, third and some-
times first person subjects.
   Imperatives are formed by the addition of an affix to the verb root;
this affix almost always ends in -a. Where there are two main conju-
gations, the imperative affix for the second - predominantly intransitive
- conjugation is often -ya; for the first - predominantly transitive -
conjugation affixes -ga or -la are commonly encountered [Hale, mimeo-b;
O'Grady, 1970: 852]. A number of languages have imperative inflections
that give some information about the number of the subject or object.
In Gumbairjgar there are two imperative inflections, according as the object
of the verb is singular (-a~-i) or plural (-Hi) [Smythe, 1948/9: 43]. In Wemba-
wemba there are distinct inflections depending on whether the subject is
singular or plural [Hercus, 1969: 65]. Similarly, the language spoken around
16                                                                       I.J Verb
Adelaide, as described by Teichelmann and Schiirmann [1840: 17], has an
imperative paradigm that distinguishes person (second/third) and number
(singular/dual/plural) of the subject. Compare with Pittapitta [Roth, 1897:
11, 21-2].","[37, 38, 39, 40]"
"10.3.1 The origin of noun classes. With the exception of the
universal affixes -ru, -bu and -bi (6.7) and emphatics -4an{a) a n d -ban
(6.1.6), nothing can follow the case affix on a noun or adjective. It is
significant, however, that in the case of noun markers the indicator of
noun class FOLLOWS the case inflection. We can also note that some
of the noun marker roots in Dyirbal - bala, gijta, gila - occur in other
Australian languages but do not as a rule inflect for case in the other
languages, and never carry any information concerning noun classification
IO.J Internal history of Dyirbal                                        353
(6.5.1, 6.5.3). Wargamay, the language most similar to Dyirbal, has
a demonstrative root yala, that occurs in locative, allative and ablative
inflection but appears not to take ergative/instrumental, dative or
genitive case endings. (None of the languages surrounding Dyirbal
show noun classification.)
   This suggests that Dyirbal may originally have had roots bala, gijia
etc. with a simple demonstrative-type meaning. That it then generalised
the case inflections of nouns to these forms. And, finally, that indicators
of noun class were added, at a rather late stage, to the root-plus-case
forms. We mentioned in 6.5.1 that the -la- from a number of noun
and verb marker forms has been dropped, to produce a form that better
satisfies the stress preferences of the language (and see 10.3.4, below).
   It remains to discover from what source noun class endings came.
A full answer cannot at present be provided but we can make a sug-
gestion concerning the ending -m for class III, which covers edible
fruit and vegetables.
   Firstly, note that there are a considerable number of languages in
Arnhem Land and the Kimberleys that have noun classes, mostly
involving a prefix to the noun and concordial prefixes throughout the
sentence. Capell [1956: 41] has tabulated class prefixes for thirteen
languages from these regions. Every one of the languages has a prefix
referring entirely or almost entirely to vegetable foodstuffs. The prefixes
have the following form:
                         ma-     in 6 languages
                         m-      in 4 languages
                         mi-     in 2 languages
                         mu-     in 1 language
Note the similarity to the class III suffix, -m, in Dyirbal.
   Secondly, note that many Australian languages tend to include a
generic term and a specific term together in an NP. For instance, in
Dyabugay (eighty miles to the north of Dyirbal) a typical NP would be
mijia wawwty involving both mijia 'animal* and wawun 'turkey'. It is
significant that Dyirbal does NOT exhibit this behaviour. Now the
generic noun for 'vegetable foodstuffs' over a large section of North
Australia is mayiy or something similar (Dyabugay has ma: and Yidin
mayi).
   This suggests the following lines of development. In the Kimberleys
and Arnhem Land, a specific name of a type of vegetable food was as
354                                            io. j   Internal history of Dyirbal2L rule preceded by the generic noun mayi within an NP; then mayi
gradually degenerated to become a prefix to the specific terms. The
forms of the prefix in twelve of CapelPs languages (ma-> mi- and m-)
are entirely natural degenerate forms of mayi; mu- occurs in only one
language, and suggests that there has been some sound change in this
instance.
   In the case of Dyirbal an NP may have typically involved: a form
bala, gijia, yala etc (in case inflection agreeing with the head noun),
followed by a generic term (e.g. mayi ' vegetable foodstuff'), followed
by the specific name of some particular edible plant. As in the Arnhem
Land/Kimberleys area, the generic term gradually took on the status
of an affix, but in Dyirbal it became a SUFFIX to the bala> gijia etc. forms.
After mayi had been assimilated into the grammar in this way, Dyirbal must
have borrowed (or otherwise acquired) its present generic term for non-flesh
food, zvu4u. Note that the form mayi does occur in Dyirbal, as the name for
* English bee' - this must be a very recent borrowing, within the last two
hundred years (that is, since the introduction of English bees into the continent).
  The discussion above is largely repeated from Dixon [1968 c]; see also the
discussion of the evolution of noun classes in Olgolo in Dixon [1970 a].","[376, 377, 378]"
"   The paradigm for yala- noun markers is identical to that for bala-
forms, with initial b- replaced by y- in each case. The 'visible and here'
paradigm is more complex; yala- is the first segment for non-nominative
forms, while the suppletive form gipa- is used in the nominative
(shown in Table 3.3).

     Class IV      gipa          yarjgu          yagu          yavuAgain, the class I nominative form is irregular. In G the nominative
forms are yiyi, yipanf yijiam and yijia respectively (yipa- forms, unlike
the gipa- markers in D and M, can occur in locative case - 6.5.3).
  Thus:
(1) bayi yaya miyandapu man there is laughing
(2) giyi yaya miyandapu man here (this man) is laughing
(3) Vayiyala miyandapu man is heard, but not seen, laughing
as against:
(4) balan d,ugumbil baygul yapaygu bay an man there is singing to
    woman there
(5) balan djUgumbil yaygul ya^aygu bay an man here is singing to
    woman there
(6) balan d/ugumbil yaygul yapaygu bay an man is heard, but not seen,
    singing to woman there   Of the nominative noun markers, bala- and gipa- forms are both
extremely common, while yala- forms are relatively infrequent, bala-
is the unmarked initial, and is used when no specification of visibility/
proximity is intended, gipa- has a strong demonstrative meaning and
(unlike bala- and yala-) can be used deictically:(7) S}Jl'an djUgumbil this is the woman
Of non-nominative markers, bala- forms occur perhaps ten times as
frequently as those involving yala-, which are in turn several times
more common than those involving yala-. yala- forms lack the demon-
strative force of gipa- markers.
   A gipa- marker can occur in an NP with a bala- marker - see (101)
in 4.5.1. In contrast, NPs involving both bala- and yala- forms have
not been encountered.

The comments of the last two paragraphs suggest that the inclusion of gijia-
and yala- forms in one paradigm is probably incorrect. Instead, we could
construct a full yala- paradigm, exactly like those with bala- and yala-, and
a separate short paradigm for gijia- forms, which occur in nominative case
only. We could then say that nominative yala- forms ARE NOT USED, demon-
strative markers based on gijia- always being preferred. Thus:
*(8) yayi yaxa miyandajtu
is not an acceptable Dyirbal sentence; (2) is used instead. However, in some
dialects gijta- markers do not occur with certain affixes that can follow bala-
and yala- forms, and IN THESE CASES nominative yala- markers do occur - thus
yayijtayga ' for fear of this class I thing', in which nominative yayi is followed
by -pa- and then the locative inflection (see 6.1.5); and yalanambila 'with this
class II thing' in which nominative yalan is followed by -jia- and then the
derivational affix -bila (6.1.1). These examples support the claim that nominative
markers based on the root yala- are ' suppressed' by gijia- forms; they reappear
in contexts in which gijia forms do not appear.
  ban, bam, you and yam occur as free variants of balan, balam, yalan
and yalam respectively.
This is clearly a further extension of the principle of deleting the final -la- of
bala- and yala-; note that the class IV nominative markers - bala and yala -
cannot be reduced. There are only six monosyllabic words in Dyirbal, the four
given here and two interjections ya 'yes' and yu 'alright' — 4.17.
   A further noun marker, in D and M only, is based on the root
gila\ this occurs in nominative, ergative/instrumental, dative and simple
genitive, but has a defective paradigm - 6.5.2.
Forms balay gijia and so on occur in a number of other Australian languages;
comparative notes are included in 6.5.1, 6.5.3.
   Almost all nouns have fixed class membership; the exceptions are
a handful of (kinship and human age-group) words like 4a4a 'baby',
bimu 'father's elder brother or sister' that can take class I or class II
markers depending on the sex of the referent. Nouns referring to men,
kangaroos and possums, most snakes and fishes, a few birds, most
insects, the moon, storms, boomerangs and money come under class I;
women, anything to do with fire or water, bandicoots, a few snakes
and fishes, most birds, snails, grasshoppers and crickets, the sun and
stars, and shields under class II; all wild fruit and vegetable food, and
the trees that bear them, under class III; trees (without edible fruit),
grass, sand, mud, stones, bees and honey, meat, wind, tomahawks,
noises and language under class IV. An explanation of the semantic
basis of noun class membership is in 8.4.4.

"4.6 Nominalisations of verbals
There are three ways in which a verbal can be nominalised. [1] The
commonest is by adding -muya to the verbal stem. The resulting form
functions, and takes inflections, exactly like a nominal.
  For instance, from intransitive root tfanay 'stand' can be derived
d,anaymuya '[someone who] habitually stands (a lot)'.
This functions like an adjective:
(161) yadjd balan (fyigumbil d,anaymuya buian          I saw the woman
      who is always standing around
and
(162) yayguna bay gun d,ugumbiiu a]anaymuyagu buian         the woman who
      is always standing around saw me
Here cjanaymuya modifies balanrfugumbil,the syntactic relation between
them being the same as that between a]anajiu and the topic NP balan
djUgumbil) in the simple sentence:
(163) balan cjugumbil rfanajtu woman is standing
We will refer to such deverbal nominals as * participles'.
  Similarly, the syntactic relation between a transitive participle, and
the noun it modifies, is the same as that between the corresponding
verb and the topic NP in a simple sentence. From yaijia^ay ' watch, stare'
we get yaffidjaymuya i[someone who] is always being watched', as in:
(164) yayguna baygul yayaygu yaijiq]aymuyagu bid,in the man who is
      always watched punched me
Here the syntactic relation between bayi yaya and yai/ic^aymuya is the
same as that between bayiyaya and yafjidjapu in the simple sentence:
(165) bayi ya^a bay gun djugumbiiu yaijid,ajiu woman watches man
   If we wish to have a participle which describes some person as the
habitual agent of some action (rather than as the habitual object, as
in the last example), the -yay form of the verb must be used. Thus:
yaijidjanaymuya '[someone who] always watches', and:
82                                         ^.6 Nominalisations of verbals(166) yayguna baygul ya^aygu yaip^anaymuyagu bidjin man who always
      watches punched me
The relation between bayi yaya and yaffKJanaymuya in (166) is the
same as that between bayi ya^a and yaijid,anajiu in the -yay
construction:
(167) bayiyaya bagun djUgumbilgu yaijid^anajm man watches woman
that is, it is the same as the syntactic relation between bayi ya^a and
yafficj/ajiu in the simple sentence:
(168) balan djUgumbil baygul yayaygu ya^p^apu man watches woman
   In summary, a participle that involves just a verb root plus -muya
has the same syntactic relation to the noun it modifies as the verb does
to an NP in S or O function to it; a participle that involves a root plus
-yay plus -muya has the same syntactic relation to the noun it modifies
as the verb does to an NP in A function to it. Participles are thus
formed on a nominative-ergative principle.
   Now it is an extra-linguistic fact that one may often want to refer
to someone as being the habitual subject of an intransitive action-
someone who habitually stands, or sits, or runs, or coughs. Similarly,
someone may frequently be the habitual agent of a transitive action
- he may frequently hit, or spear, or cook. However, it would be rather
unusual to find someone who was, as it were, a confirmed victim - the
habitual object of a transitive action. In fact, it would be difficult to
find another example to go besides (166), which involved a verb of
a rather special type (referring to sense perception rather than to an
action which 'affected' the object).
   Thus from balgal 'hit with a long rigid object, held in the hand;
kill' we can derive the participle balgalyaymuya 'habitual murderer'.
This is a fairly well used form - either with serious intent or in joking
fashion. However, very little sense could be attached to balgalmuya
'someone who is habitually killed'. Similar comments apply in the
case of the great majority of transitive verb roots; there simply would
not be any use for 'habitual object' participles.
   In view of this, participles of the form balgalyaymuya are frequently
shortened by the omission of -yay-, balgalmuya, as actually used, is
thus a free variant of balgalyaymuya 'murderer'. Generally, in the
case of verbs where the 'habitual object' sense is clearly unlikely, the
'habitual agent' form will more frequently occur without -yay than
4.6 Nominalisations of verbals                                             83with it; that is, balgalmuya will be encountered more frequently than
balgalyaymuya.
This might lead a casual observer to conclude that the formation of participles
followed a nominative-accusative pattern, against the predominant * nominative-
ergative pattern* in the rest of the grammar. But consideration of verbs like
rjaxji4ay> a n d the fact that informants regard balgalmuya as a shortened form
of balgalyaymuya, indicates that participles conform to the nominative-ergative
principle.
   A participle such as balgal(yay)muya indicates a person who habitually
undertakes a certain type of action, i.e. killing; it gives no information
about the object of the action. There is a further type of participle
that includes information about the object; it simply compounds object
and verb, in that order. Thus, from bundjul 'hit with a long flexible
object, e.g. spank with the flat of the hand* we get bun^ulmuya
'[someone who] habitually spanks', and ^ugumbilbundjulmuya '[someone
who] habitually spanks women', as in:
(169) bayi yaia djUgumbilbundjUlmuya banipu         the man who habitually
      spanks women is coming
Note that, by discourse ellipsis, bayiya^a might be omitted from (169),
producing:
(170) ^ugumbilbun^ulmuya banipu woman-spanker is coming
Compare with:
(171) balan d,ugumbil bundjulmuya banipu the woman who habitually
      spanks is coming
in which djUgumbil is head of the NP. Discourse ellipsis might well omit
the balany producing:
(172) cjfUgumbil bundjulmuya banipu      spanking woman is coming
The two sentences (170) and (172) might easily be confused; their
stress patterns are identical.
   However, confusion would never arise if the participles were, say,
in ergative case. Thus:
(173) yayguna baygul yayaygu $ugumbilbun$ulmuyagu mundan the
      woman-spanking man took me
(174) yayguna bay gun rfugumbipu bund,ulmuyagu mundan the spanking
      woman took me
84                                              ^.6 Nominalisations of verbalsWith discourse ellipsis omitting baygul yayaygu in (173) and baygun in
(174) we would get:
(175) yayguna a]ugumbilbunq]ulmuyagu mundan woman-spanker took me
(176) yayguna <%ugumbiiu buncj/ulmuyagu mundan spanking woman took
      me
The fact that q]ugumbil is in ergative inflection in (176) indicates that it
is a free word, the head of the A N P ; the fact that there is no inflection
on djUgumbil'vsx (175) indicates that it is the first morpheme in a compound
participle.
The difference between sentences of the form (175) and (176) is brought out
most effectively with the verb wadil 'swive (i.e. have sexual intercourse with)'.
Compare:
(177) yayguna baygul yaxaygu wadilmurjagu balgan
(178) yayguna barjgul yaxawadilmurjagu balgan
The first of these indicates * I was hit by a man who habitually swives [women]'
(a fuller specification would have been:
(179) yayguna barjgul yaiaygu cfugumbilwadilmuyagu balgan)
In contrast, (178) can only mean ' I was hit by the man-swiving man - that is,
by a homosexual*. (Homosexuality was unknown to the Dyirbalrjan before
white contact, and the reaction of informants was that (178) was nonsensical
- or, that if such a man did exist, he should be killed.)
   A participle may refer to something inanimate. Thus, from transitive
gimbil 'blow (as of wind)', we may form gimbilyaymuya 'that which
blows a lot'; this can modify balagulubu iwind':
(180) bala gulubu gimbilyaymuya the wind which blows a lot
or, the shorter form:
(181) bala gulubu gimbilmuya      (as (180))
   Just as a verb complex may contain a verb and an adverbal, so may
a noun be modified by a participial verb and a participial adverbal -
for instance, corresponding to simple sentence:
(182) balam            wud,u       baygul        yayaygu a]aygajiu
       THERE-NOM-III food-NOM THERE-ERG-I man-ERG eat-PRES/PAST
      ganbin
      do badly-PREs/PAST
      man eats food sloppily
we can have:
(183) bayiya^a cjayganaymuya ganbilmuya banijiu man who is a sloppy
      eater is coming
4-6 Nominalisations of verbals                                          85Note that -yay can optionally be omitted from a]ayganaymuya\ it
would almost always be omitted from the adverbal participle, as in
(183), on the principle that it would be unnecessarily redundant to
include -yay twice.
   We have thus far described participles involving -muya. There are
two other types:
   [2] a verbal stem by itself can function as a participle. This appears
to be a little less strong than a -muya form. Thus:
                    ' [someone who] habitually stands'
           djOnaymuya ' [someone who] habitually stands a lot*A transitive simple stem participle MUST be compounded with an
object noun. Thus we can have:
(184) yayguna baygul yapabalgapu bupan he, who habitually murders
      men, saw me
but not:
^(185) yayguna baygulyayaygu balgayu buyan   In M both stem and sttm-\Aus-muya forms are common; in D, while
both do occur, stem-plus-muya forms are far more frequent, and are
preferred.
   [3] there are also participles involving a verbal root and suffix
-ginay, e.g. tfanayginay. This may be a dialectal form only: -ginay
appears to have been the most common participial type in the Gulrjay
dialect; it occurs in M but is less used than the -muya type; it is not
used at all in D.
  Participial -ginay is almost certainly related to the nominal affix
-ginay 'full of, covered with'-6.1.1. There is a number adjective
muya 'many' (6.1.7) which may or may not be historically related to
participial -muya.
  Note that participles can modify pronouns, just as they do nouns:
(186) balan cfugumbil yaq]a QanaydjU balgan whilst standing (as I
      habitually do), I hit woman4.7     Verbalisations

      [i] it may be transformed into an intransitive verbal stem by the
          addition of -bil;
  or [2] it may be transformed into a transitive verbal stem by the
          addition of: -mal to a stem of two syllables; -{m)bal to a stem
          of more than two syllables.
Thus from noun waju 'bend' we can derive transitive verbal stem
wa^umal 'make bendy'; from the reduplicated form waiuwaju 'many
bends' is derived waiuwaiubal 'make very bendy'.
  We can have:
(187) bayi yaya bulganbin the man has become big (i.e. has grown
      big recently)
as well as (4.5.1):
(188) bayi yapa bulgan the man is big
The difference between (187) and (188) lies entirely in the active/
stative contrast (in the traditional sense) between verbal form bulganbil
in (187) and nominal form bulgan in (188) - see 5.9.
   A typical verbalisation involves adjective wuygi 'no good':
(189) yad,a wuygibin     I feel ill
  Verbalised adjectives are encountered more often than verbalised
nouns, but any noun can be (transitively or intransitively) verbalised:
(190) bala              mila             wumabin
       THERE-NOM-IV clearing-NOM undergrowth-iNTR VBLSR-PRES/PAST
       the thick scrub is growing back into the clearing
(191) yaygu daman baryanbin my son has become a youth (i.e. has
       passed through puberty)
As another example, 4uSumbilbil 'become a woman' literally implies change
of sex (the process of growing up to womanhood would be described through
the term for 'adolescent girl', as in (191)). There is a Dyirbalrjan hermaphrodite
— although nominally a man, he is said to have underdeveloped genitals, and
has rather pronounced breasts; as he has grown older his feminine characteristics
have become more noticeable. It is said of him, in a semi-joking way: bayi
djUgumbilbin.
  A verbalised noun or adjective indicates some quite definite change
of state, often a surprising one. For instance, if a boy grew a beard in
the normal way, this would be described (for -bila see 6.1.1):
(192) bayi jtumbulbila literally: he is (now) with beard i.e. he now
      has a beard
4-7 Verbalisations                                                          87The sentence
(193) bayi jiumbulbin
implies an abnormal growth-say, a beard appearing at the age of
eight.
  A verbalised nominal can make up a complete VC:
(194) bayi yaja guyibin man is dead/man died
(195) yad,a bayiyapaguyiman I killed man (i.e. caused him to be dead)
Most frequently, though, a verbalised nominal occurs with a verb-root
form, as in (199) and (202):
(196) yad,a bayi ya^a baygaji I will paint man
(197) bayi ya^a gulgip man is pretty (i.e. with paint)
(198) bayi yaya gulgipbiji man will become pretty (i.e. when painted)
(199) yadja bayi yapa gulgipmbajt baygaji I will paint the man prettily
(200) bala gama d,igil the gama-style song is good
(201) bala gama baygul ya^aygu bay an man sings gama-style song
(202) bala gama baygul yayaygu djigilman bay an man sings gama-style
      song well
Verb forms can also be derived from participles. For instance bayi fanaycjanaybin
'he has started standing about' was encountered. Here a verbal root is first
nominalised, and then the resultant nominal is verbalised. Whereas verb
4anajiu refers to an actual act of standing, for some time (note: NOT * coming
into standing position'), 4anaybin implies that the subject has the habit of
standing around, and that he has recently acquired this habit.
   Most Australian languages have affixes that verbalise nominals. The transitive
verbaliser is frequently similar in form to Dyirbal -mal~ -{m)bal - see 1.7. For
instance, Gumbaingar has transitive verbaliser -mbei~-ndei (and intransitive
-ei~-yei~-wei) [Smythe, 1948/9: 16]; and in Bailko there is transitiviser -ma
and intransitiviser -ya [O'Grady et al., 1966: 87].","[105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 110, 111]"
"4.11.2 Involving general genitive inflection. The difference
between the two kinds of genitive inflection is that the simple genitive,
-yu, indicates a relation of present possession, whereas the general
genitive, -mi, indicates a past owner. There is sometimes, in the use
of -tni> an indication that the object referred to still belongs to the
past owner - although it is not currently in his possession - and that
he might return to reclaim his property; in other instances, -mi does
not carry this implication. Genitives -yu and -mi thus involve an
aspectual-type contrast, rather like the contrast between -yu and -mi
relative clauses in M (see 5.5.2).
   Amongst the uses of the general genitive are:
   [1] to describe something that is (perhaps temporarily) abandoned
by its owner. Thus, on encountering some huts built by the neighbouring
tribe, but not at present inhabited by them, a speaker might describe
them: dulgubarami bala mid,a.
   [2] to describe something lost by its owner:
(324) bayuldjin waybalami yad,a d,iga maygan I picked up the cigarettes
      of the white man (sc.: that he dropped and lost)
Note that since there is no general genitive inflection of noun markers,
a simple genitive marker accompanies a noun in either simple or general
4*n   Possessive phrases                                               109genitive inflection. Here bayuldjin accompanies - and agrees in case
and class with - waybalami.
  [3] to describe something given by its owner (particularly European-
type giving, involving a white man - cf. 2.4):
(325) yayguna yaiaygu minban          margindu
      I-o     man-ERG shoot-PREs/PAST gun-iNST
      waybalamigu
      white man-GENL GEN-INST
      man shot me with gun from the white man (i.e. that the white
      man gave or sold him)   [4] to describe something that belonged to someone else, who is
now dead. For instance bayi wayal yumami might - amongst other
interpretations - refer to a boomerang that used to belong to the
speaker's (dead) father. Anything which is very old, so that its origin
is forgotten, may be described as d,ud,abami 'belonging to cfucfaba, the
mythical first man and creator'.
   [5] -mi sometimes appears to have a function and meaning similar
to that of the ablative -yunu. The similarities and differences can be
seen in:
(326) yaa]a banipu ya^ami I came from men
(327) yaa]a banipu yayayunu I came from men(327) implies that the speaker is returning from a short visit to a group
of strangers; (326), on the other hand, states that the speaker was at
one time a member of the group, he was 'owned by them'.
   [6] other uses of -mi that have been noted include: bala guwalmi buri
' a name that belonged to the language'; and an idiom-like sentence in
D by which a woman can describe her husband's leaving her:(328) yumalmi               yaygu       wiru           yanu
      body-GENL GEN-NOM I-GEN-NOM husband-NOM gO-PRES/PAST
      d,agunda
      night-LOC
The literal meaning of (328) is probably 'my husband, who belonged
to my body, left in the night'.
   -mi genitives are considerably less common than -yu forms; they
appear to inflect like nominals - as do simple genitives - but do not
require a catalytic affix:
110                                                     4-11   Possessive phrases   [i] -mi plus instrumental - (325) and:

      minban

       budilyaygu j       I'll go up [to town] immediately to draw money from the police-
       man up there
See 6.5.4 for an explanation of yayundaygu.
  General genitives in allative and locative inflection are also attested.
Note that a general genitive can NOT be followed by ablative inflection.
-yu and -mi genitives can occur together in the same NP, at least in a pro-
leptic construction (6.1.5):
(331) balam wuga d,iga rjaygu waybalami give me a cigarette from [that packet]
      the white man [gave you]!
See also (328).
   Gugu-Yimidir is said by Roth to have two genitives, that appear rather
similar to -yu and -mi in Dyirbal: [1] when the article possessed is not in its
real lawful owner's possession, -ga; [2] when the article possessed is in its
real lawful owner's possession,... the lawful owner being represented by a
noun: -we after a vowel, -be or -e after a consonant. Note that the -gu inflection
in Gugu-Yimidir covers inalienable as well as alienable possession [Roth,
1901a: 16]. For further discussion of this point see Haviland [forthcoming].","[132, 133, 134]"

dominated by VP is in A function. (Again, we are leaving aside secondary
categories such as tense.)
  The leftmost mode dominated by 2 is in each case the topic NP.
  We mentioned (4.3) that a VC can involve any number of verbs
and/or adverbals provided that they agree in surface transitivity (and
in final inflection). The requirement on agreement in transitivity is in
the nature of a surface structure constraint. A verb in -yay form is
surface intransitive (as mentioned in 4.9.3). This can be seen from:
   [1] The fact that a -yay form can occur in a VC with an intransitive
verb, but not with a transitive verb. Thus, in text xv, line 10 (p. 370)
we have:
(455) ap4a     ban             yibiq]aran          baligayul

      follow-^Oy-PRES/PAST follow-PRES/PAST
      the two women followed the same route
where the VC involves the intransitive root maril 'follow', and the
-yay form of transitive banzai 'follow*.
   [2] In G there are different forms of the singular pronouns for
functions S, O and A. Thus, in G :
(456) yad,a bayiya^a banyan    I followed man
but
(457) Vayba baygul yayaygu ban^alyajtu         I followed man
It will be seen that the S form of the pronoun is used with the -yay
verbal form.
   Now:

                        (jugumbil   ""
Let us consider -yay constructions in which the O NP is in ergative
inflection (leaving aside, for the time being, those in which the O NP
is in dative case). In providing a tree representation for:(459) bayiyaia baygun djugumbixu balgalyapu man hit womanwe have to show: [1] that bayi yaya is now topic of the sentence; and
[2] that the VC is now 'intransitive*.
   This is achieved if we represent (459) as:
(xl)
                                        s
That is, the -yay transformation lifts the A NP (bayiyaia in this case),
and attaches it to 2, to the left of any other node dominated by 2 ; it
also attaches the feature [-yay] to the VC. By our convention that the
leftmost constituent is topic, the A NP is now identified as topic. And
we can define transitivity:
   [1] a VC exhaustively dominated by a VP is ' intransitive'; and
   [2] a VC directly dominated by a VP that also directly dominates
       an NP is ' transitive \
Now balgal [-yay] in (xl) is, like the VC in (xxxvii), intransitive.
   The -yay rule can now be written (see also 5.11.2):
152                                      5-4 Tree representation of topic-chains(a) -yay TRANSFORMATION

the following convention:
(/3) CASE MARKING
   (i) the leftmost NP immediately dominated by 2 (i.e. the topic NP)
       is in nominative case:
  (ii) all other NPs are in ergative case.
Thus bayi yaira - dominated by VP - in (xxxix) is given ergative
inflection, as is balan ^ugumbil in (xl), the second leftmost NP dominated
by 2.
   Verbs in reflexive and reciprocal form (4.8.1, 4.8.2) are also surface
intransitive. In the case of a true reflexive:
(460) bayi yaya buybayiripu man hid himself
we have an underlying ternary deep relation. The tree representation
for (460) is thus, at the deepest level:
(xli)
                                                 buybal
If the A and O NPs have identical referent, the reflexive transformation
applies. This deletes the A NP, and marks the VC as reflexive:
( y ) REFLEXIVE TRANSFORMATION

5.4    Tree representation of topic-chains                                  153The condition in (7) is formulated to allow for such exceptional, but apparently
possible, sentences as (cf. (223)):
(461) bayi           yara       mala           4aVSaymariPu
       THERE-NOM-I man-NOM hand-NOM eat-REFL-PRES/PAST

which is plainly derived from:

  Applying rule (7) to (xli) we obtain:
(xliii)
                                               buybal
                                                [refl]
The VC in (xliii) is now intransitive, and the NP receives the same
case inflection as does the topic in an intransitive simple sentence. The
correctness of this specification can be verified from an examination
of pronominal forms used in G. If there were no reflexive rule:
(xliv)
                                                   buybal
would presumably be realised by G.

   False reflexives involve a rule identical to (a), with the reflexive
affix in place of -yay; we are unable to give any syntactic representation
of, or explanation for, the semantic difference (involving actual and
potential actions) between -yay forms and false reflexives (4.8.1).
   Reciprocals are discussed in 5.10.1.","[173, 174, 175, 176, 177, 178]"
"[3] 'OR'
There are two kinds of statements of alternatives. Closed disjunction -
X or Y or Z - insists that the listed alternatives exhaustively cover all
possibilities. Open disjunction - X or Y or Z o r . . . - can suggest that
X, Y and Z are the most likely alternatives, but that there MIGHT be
some unanticipated further alternatives. Some languages can show
both kinds of disjunction (thus Chinese has different particles 'or'
variously representing open and closed disjunction and also depending
on the syntactic environment - I am grateful to M. A. K. Halliday for
this information). English 'or' refers only to closed disjunction. Dyirbal,
on the other hand, deals mainly with open disjunction, through the
particle yamba 'perhaps, might be'. Thus the only way in which
Dyirbal can translate ' I saw a fish, it was either a barramundi or a red
bream' is through:
(693) rjadja guya buyon] gilabayd,i mi/ia/ yuguf yambaj yarjgal yamba]
      I saw a fish, what was it down there ? - it might have been a barra-
      mundi, or it might have been a red bream
That is, the Dyirbal sentence leaves open the possibility that it was
some other type of fish. (Although Dyirbal could add a rider stating
364                                                  Appendix A, Dyirbal logicthat it could not have been anything else, i.e. closing the disjunction,
just as English can create an open disjunction by including 'or some-
thing else'.)
It can be argued that ' closed disjunction' is a philosophical idealisation - in
the real world it is seldom possible to exclude some further alternative, how-
ever much of a statistical longshot it might be. And that it is only in terms of
this rather unrealistic idealisation that some logical paradoxes can be formulated
(on this see Reichmann 1964: 120-1).
   It is interesting to note the ways in which speakers of different dialects of
English get around the limited possibilities of 'closed disjunction'. Thus in
reply to a question ' when will he come ?' a speaker of British English might
reply 'probably at 10 or 11', with the 'probably' serving to leave open other
alternatives. In American English a reply could be 'might be 10, might be 11';
this would be unacceptable in Standard British English, but is exactly paralleled
by the construction in Dyirbal.
  Other logical notions have straightforward expression in Dyirbal.
Thus, 'all' is rendered by nominal affix -mumbay (6.1.1) or else by
the adverbal djdyrjul 'do all, finish' with object orientation (8.3):
(694) gijiandjdna cj/Ugumbilmumbay all the people here are women

Appendix B                Previous work on DyirbalPrevious work on the dialects of Dyirbal can be grouped into three
categories. Firstly, work by amateurs who had no linguistic training
and no understanding of or feel for the language. The earliest attempt
was that of William Carron, botanist with the Kennedy expedition, on
26 May 1848. The three words given by Carron were probably taken
from speakers of Giramay; they are [Carron, 1849: 9]:
     'hammoo', fresh water (probably gamu)
     'taa-taa' dog (probably G guda, possibly Wargamay bada)
     'mocull' salt water (the original is unrecognisable)The next publications were an eighty-word ' Vocabulary of the Kirrami
tribe' by A. Douglas Douglas [1900]-mistakenly attributed to A. C.
MacDougall in Craig [1967]-and a two-hundred-word 'Vocabulary
of the Kiramai language' by the Rev. J. Mathew [1926]. Allowing
maximum leeway for different possibilities of orthographic represen-
tation, only 20% of Douglas's words are correctly transcribed. John
Mathew grew up as a speaker of Gabi and wrote a useful account of
that language; he must, however, have had the most glancing of
acquaintanceships with Giramay, and his transcription is less than
successful, especially as regards vowels. More recently, Sydney May
[1954] produced a list of 117 Mamu words; not only are these badly
transcribed, but May attempts to hear a distinction in Mamu where
there is none, to correspond to every contrast in English. He has tipan
'rock' but tipun 'stone' (both are dibari), andpookabin 'dead' as against
porkarbin 'to die (v)' (bugabin must have been meant, in each case).
   Vocabularies such as the above could only have any value if they were
the sole documentation of a language now dead. As it is, they have no
claim to further consideration or listing. Much the same applies to the
work of Aguas [1966] and Worms [Nekes and Worms, 1953]. Aguas
was sponsored by the Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies but her
transcription of Dyiru words and sentences shows many inaccuracies.
Father Worms had a considerable reputation in Australia as a linguist
                                 [365]
366                                  Appendix B. Previous work on Dyirbalbut his work on Dyirbal and surrounding dialects can only be described
as wretched. He gives word lists in several dialects and a short ' Djirbal
text'; this is actually in Mamu, with one Dyirbal word. Almost every
word is mistranscribed: gambil is written yambil, yumal as yumal and
both baygul and bayul as bayul. Verb form bayirijiu (quoted as bail
riyu) 'turn oneself around* is split into two halves, bait (verbal root
'turn, twist, wring') being wrongly identified as the noun marker bayi
'he', and riyu (reflexive affix plus unmarked tense inflection) is glossed
'turned1. Worms also mentions [1953: 67] 'analogies founded on the
similarity of shape' and gives as example Dyirbal bigun which he says
can mean 'shield* or 'fingernail', the language exploiting a similarity
of convex form between the two objects. In fact bigun is 'fingernail'
and bigin ' shield'; speakers of Dyirbal do not appear to observe any
connection between the two objects. Worms' transcriptions are so
bad, and his knowledge of the basic principles of descriptive and
comparative linguistics so slight, that none of his inferences can be
trusted. In particular, the cognate sets he recognises between languages
in different parts of the continent are almost entirely spurious.
   Banfield [1908,1911,1918,1925] mentions a fair number of aboriginal
habits and so on, sometimes attempting a transcription of a relevant
word. Gladys Henry's [1967] collection of a score or so Dyirbal myths
is the most ambitious amateur anthropological project from the area,
and achieves a measure of success. The stories were taken down in
English and are often only snatches of a longer tale, but a good deal
of useful information has been recorded. The most interesting feature
of her book is a map of the Tully and Murray Rivers, with aboriginal
names for every bend and hillock. It is all the more disappointing that
the transcription is so poor.
   The second category includes the work of W. E. Roth. Employed
first as a surgeon in the Gulf country Roth soon wrote a description of
Pittapitta [1897]-this contained a good grammatical sketch but was
phonetically poor. After his appointment as Northern Protector of
Aborigines, based at Cooktown, Roth made several studies of sections
of the six tribes speaking Dyirbal. In 1898 he wrote ethnological notes
on three tribes encountered in the Atherton area - Chirpal-jl (Dyir-
baldyi), Ngachan-ji (Ngadyandyi) and Ngikoongo-I (this has not yet
been identified). He recorded about two hundred words in each dialect
- these were transcribed laboriously (with much use of diacritics) but
on the whole accurately. He appears to have rewritten the three lists
Appendix B. Previous work on Dyirbal                                         367about 1900, simplifying and improving the transcription - thus dia-
critics are omitted, -00- changed to -#-, and so on. Roth also secured
a word list from a different group of Dyirbaldyi, at Herberton, in
October 1900.
   Roth's most important work in the Dyirbal area was the preparation,
in September 1900, of a 104-page 'Scientific Report on the Natives
of the Lower Tully River'; a 22-page appendix was added in December
of that year, following a further visit to the Tully. Roth includes a great
deal of important information on the Malanbara tribe's organisation,
habits, songs, food, etc.; a considerable number of Gulrjay words and
phrases are included, on the whole fairly accurately transcribed. This
study, and the Atherton vocabularies and notes, remain unpublished
[uncatalogued manuscript 216, Mitchell Library, Sydney], but some
important extracts did appear in various of the North Queensland
Ethnography bulletins [Roth, 1901-10].
All the indications are that Roth made a genuine attempt to assist the aborigines
of North Queensland during his years as protector - for instance, he insisted
that settlers who used aboriginal labour should pay regular wages. Roth took
action against Lachlan (2.6) for 'associating with a native woman* and Lachlan
was so incensed that, late in 1902, he filed a complaint against Roth with the
Legislative Assembly in Brisbane. This appears to have been the beginning
of a campaign to oust the protector. The month of Lachlan's complaint, Mr
John Hamilton, the member for Cook, obtained by a subterfuge a photograph
Roth had taken for 'ethnographic purposes' and circulated it in an attempt
to discredit him. In 1905 a petition — whose signatories included Lachlan-
was drawn up against Roth's reappointment; it was dismissed by parliament.
But, with the controversy still continuing, Roth resigned on 10 June 1906, and
went to British Guiana.
   The attitude of the Queensland government towards aborigines gradually
hardened in the years following Roth's departure. In 1914 aborigines from the
Tully River area were taken, some in chains, to a settlement at Hull River;
when that was destroyed by the 1918 cyclone they were removed to Palm
Island. It is also worth noting that, in the fifty years after Roth, there was - in
the whole of Queensland - just one piece of professional or semi-professional
linguistic research undertaken: that of McConnel [1945 etc.].
   Thirdly, a number of professional linguists - including Hale and
West [Craig, 1967], and Wurm-have in the last decade or so done
some work on dialects of Dyirbal. In each case only a few words have
been gathered, all of which remain unpublished. N. B. Tindale has
been working on the Cairns rain forest area on and off since the late
thirties, and has gathered some incidental linguistic material (none of
which has been published).
TextsAbout forty texts in D, G and M have been obtained by the writer;
four are in Dyalnuy and the remainder in Guwal. They include myths,
stories of recent events (the last cannibalism, an outrage by Lachlan -
2.6), and everyday conversations (semi-secretly recorded). The three
texts given below have been chosen largely because they illustrate
a wide range of grammatical features. Tapes of these texts, and both
tapes and transcriptions of other texts mentioned above, have been
deposited with the Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies, P.O.

   Noun markers do not appear in general genitive, locative, allative
or ablative forms (see the discussion of verb markers - 3.4.5). Class III
covers just fruit and vegetables; not unnaturally, there is no possessive
form of the class III marker (there is a form bay urn but it is a verb
marker 'from there' - 3.4.5).
The only class IV nouns that do not have inanimate reference are names of
bees. Elicitation produced bala girjujal barju guburrju ' the honey belonging to
3.2 Nominals: nouns and adjectives                                           45the native bee', involving the genitive form of the class IV marker; barju can
also occur in the possessive forms of pseudo-pronouns balagara and balamarjgan
-3-3.2.
  A noun marker can be analysed into three parts: first, a root such
as bala-; second, a case inflection:
       nominative: zero
       ergative/instrumental: -f)2u-\
                               JS          ,     •, , 1 .

       dative: -gu-                 \ ° . c, ,
            -     ..                   the -la- of bala-
       simple genitive: -yu-       J
third, a mark of the class of the noun:
                       class I: -/      class III: -m
                       class II: -n     class IV: zero
Nominative class I form is exceptional, being bayi when *balal would
be expected.
The reasons for recognising the first part of a marker to be bala-> with deletion
of -la- for non-nominative cases, rather than postulating that the first part is
ba-, with nominative adding -la-y are given in 6.5.1; it should be noted that
forms such as ergative balarjgul do occur, albeit infrequently.","[68, 69]"
"3.4.2 Conjugations. There are two patterns of verbal inflection in
Dyirbal, depending on whether the stem (as set up) ends in -/ or in
-y. Thus each verbal root falls into one of two conjugational subclasses.
   There is some correlation between conjugational subclasses and
transitivity. That is:
     of transitive verbal roots
        about 90 % are -/ forms, the remainder -y forms
     of intransitive verbal roots
        about 80% are -y forms, the remainder -/ forms
Dyirbal conjugations are clearly related to the two major conjugation types,
which recur in many Australian languages (1.7). In Dyirbal, it is most eco-
nomical and revealing to consider each verb root, and each verbal-stem-forming
affix, as ending in either -/ or -yy according to the inflectional pattern of the
resulting form. Stem-final -/ and -y are retained before some affixes, but
assimilated or lost before others.
   It is probable that at one time all transitive roots were in the -/, and all
intransitive roots in the -yy conjugation. Some verbs may have changed
transitivity while maintaining the same conjugational association — one piece
of evidence supporting this is given in the discussion of reflexives, 4.9.3. In
addition, loan items may sometimes have had a meaning suggesting a certain
transitivity, but a form suggesting a conjugational placement that went against
the normal correlation.
   Verbs in the -/ conjugation end in -aly -uly or -ily those in the -y conjugation
in -iy or -ayy NEVER in -uy. No reason is known for the absence of -uy roots.
Note that, in the analysis of Henry and Ruth Hershberger, Gugu-Yalanji
verbs in the second conjugation are assigned roots ending in -ay or -iyy never
in -uy - 1.7. (We could have omitted the -y from underlying verb forms -iy in
3.4   Verbals: verbs and adverbals                                          55Dyirbal, thus producing a description that corresponded exactly with the
Hershbergers* for Gugu-Yalanji; in fact we postulate a rule that deletes -y
following -i- in certain circumstances - 7.5.2.)3.4.3 Tense. Dyirbal has a two-term tense system, with an unmarked
term referring to past or present time, and a marked term for reference
to future time.
Either past or present time can be unambiguously shown by inclusion of an
appropriate time qualifier - 4.14, 6.4. Past time can also be indicated, in all
dialects, by special use of a relative clause verbal inflection-4.10. See also
4.5.5 for -yurciy which can be used in a way that suggests an * immediate future*
tense.
   Interestingly, Yidin, Wargamay and Nyawigi - languages to the north and
south of Dyirbal - also have a two-term tense system, but of the opposite
kind: past/non-past.
  The full paradigm for tense inflection is:
                     -/ stem                   -y stem
    stem             balgal' hit'             baniy ' come'
    unmarked tense balgan 'hits/hit'            banijiu 'comes/came'
    c               TDM balgan 'will hit'       DM banin 'will come'
                             6
    future tense {             /                     . j
                    [G balgalqay               G baninqay
   The 'future' inflection can also carry a generic meaning, similar to
that of the English present tense (e.g. 'he shoots horses').
   There is one irregular verb, yanu 'go'. Roughly, this behaves like
an -/ root yanul for all forms but positive imperatives - where the root
is yana(l) - except that the unmarked tense form is yanu and not
yanun. For a full account see 6.3.3.
3.4.4 Interrogative and deictic verbs. There are two interrogative
forms - transitive wiyamal and intransitive wiyamay - ranging over the
classes of verbs and adverbals. Used by itself one of these forms means
'do what?'; used with a verb it becomes an adverbal interrogative
'do how?'. Thus:
(14) bayiyaia wiyamajiu what was man doing?
(15) rjinda bayiya^a wiyaman what did you do to man?
(16) bayiyaia wiyamajiu mabin how did man cross river?
(17) rjinda bayiyaia wiyaman balgan how did you hit man?
  When used adverbially, wiyamal/wiyamay can be enquiring about
the way in which the action was accomplished, or about the instrument
56                                            3*4 Vwbals: verbs and adverbaisused, or about the degree of success achieved. Thus a reply to (16)
could be:
(18) bayi yaya yuyarajiu mabin man swam across river
and to (17) might be:
(19) yacja bayi yapa baygu yuguygu balgan I hit man with stick
while a reply to either (16) or (17) might involvegard,a 'alright':
(20) gard,abi bayi ya^a mabin man crossed river properly
(21) gardjabi yad,a bayi ya^a balgan I hit man properly
(see 6.7.3 f° r the affix -bi)
   There are two deictic adverbals - transitive yalamal and intransitive
yalamay — that function very much like wiyamal and wiyamay; they
mean ' it is done like this' and usually either refer to a mime accompany-
ing the utterance or else introduce quoted speech:
(22) yad,a bayi ya^a yalaman balgan I hit man like this (with accom-
      panying mime)
(23) yad,a yinuna yalaman yanban/wujt^ifi bayiyaya miyandajm I asked
      you this way 'Where is the man who is laughing?'
   In narrative, yalamal/yalamay can often be used alone - that is,
without any verb such as yanban 'ask', buwajtu 'tell', wurbajtu 'say' -
to introduce reported speech; an example is in line 80 of text xv (p. 382).
However, in elicitation, informants always insisted on inserting the
appropriate verb - when a version of (23) that did not include yanban
was suggested, it was emphasised that the sentence could only be
acceptable if yanban were to be inserted - indicating that the absence
of a verb of saying is due to discourse ellipsis.
   The interrogative and deictic verbs in M are wiyabal and wiyabayy
yalabal and yalabay.
The deictic verb forms are clearly historically related to the noun marker
root yala-, referring to something * visible and here, i.e. THIS THING'. The
-mal/-bal element of the transitive deictic may be genetically related to transitive
verbalising suffix -trial ~-(m)bal, 4.7. Within the terms of the present, syn-
chronic analysis of Dyirbal, however, deictic verbs are not morphologically
analysable.
  There are just a few other transitive/intransitive pairs that have the same
form bar the final consonant - 9.2.1.
3.4.5 Verb markers. A verb can be accompanied by one of a set of
eight verb markers, that have some morphological correspondence with
noun markers (3.2.2); they provide locational qualification for the
verb. They are:
3.4   Verbals: verbs and adverbals                                                   57ALLATIVE OF PLACE              balu ' to there            yalu 'to here
                               (towards a place)'         (towards a place)'
ALLATIVE OF DIRECTION          bait ' to there (in a      yali ' to here (in a
                               direction)'                direction)'
ABLATIVE                       bayum ' from there *       yayum 'from here'
LOCATIVE                       balay '(at) there'         yalay ' (at) here'
  Just as in the case of noun markers, to any verb marker can be added
one of the twelve bound forms baydji etc., and/or one of the three
bound forms gaii etc., any of which may be augmented by -ru (3.2.3).
   In D and G there are also verb markers with initial ya-, referring to
something remembered from the past. Forms yalu, yayum and yalay
are attested but not, in this sense, *yali (the form yali is pre-empted
by the first person dual pronoun - see 3.3.1).
   There are also markers based on the root gila - see 6.5.2.
3.4.6 Locational nominate. A verb may also be accompanied by
a noun in allative, ablative or locative inflection, optionally accompanied
by an adjective in the same inflection. Thus we have, from bala miq]a
'camp', mid,agu 'to the camp', mia]ayunu 'from the camp', miq]ayga
'at the camp'. An allative or locative (but not an ablative) form may
be augmented by -ru, with an implication of motion: mia]aygaru could
be, for example, ' [going] along by the side of the camp' or ' through
the camp'.
   In summary, a verb may be modified by [1] a verb marker, or [2] a
locational - that is, allative, ablative or locative - nominal, or [3] both.
If both occur they must agree in case - 4.3.
   A noun in nominative, ergative, instrumental, (simple) genitive or
dative case is normally accompanied by a noun marker, that indicates
its class. A noun in allative, locative or ablative inflection cannot be
accompanied by a noun marker; it can co-occur with a verb marker
(that does not show class). A comparative study of the morphology of
noun and verb markers is in 6.5.
A noun in allative, locative or ablative inflection could be regarded as an
ad hoc place name; in these circumstances, noun class is clearly irrelevant. The
Dyirbalrjan have a multiplicity of place names - for every bend in a river and
dip in a ridge - often in terms of the type of tree that grows there, the rock
formation, etc. It is frequently difficult to distinguish between an institutionalised
place name, and simple reference to a particular object at some locality.
  One set of verbs, concerned with motion - for example baniy 'come',
58                                          3'4   Verbals: verbs and adverbalsmabil'cross river' - can only select an allative or ablative verb-marker-
and/or-locational-nominal. Another set, concerned with position-for
example, jtinay 'stay, sit', q]anay ' s t a n d ' - c a n only select locative
forms. Some other verbs - such as bu^al 'look' - can occur with either
motion or position qualification.
 For these selections, a locational nominal augmented by -ru behaves either as
a rest or as a motion form. Thus yanu mid,ar)garu ' go through the camp', and
jtinajiu mi4arjgaru i sit just outside the camp \3.4.7 Interrogative verb markers. There is a set of interrogative
forms corresponding to verb markers:
         ALLATIVE OF PLACE          wujidjaru 'to which place?'
        ALLATIVE OF DIRECTION       wujid,ari 'in which direction?'
        ABLATIVE                    wujid,ar)um ' where from ?'
        LOCATIVE                    wujia^ay ' where (at) ?'
The bound forms bay#, gait etc. cannot be added to interrogative verb
markers; and locational nominals cannot occur with them.","[78, 79, 80, 81, 82]"

noun, take the catalytic affix -(p)$n- and then any further case inflection
(including, in this case, locative, allative or ablative). The full pronoun
paradigm for the three dialects is shown in Table 3.4.
   The forms given against a dialect are the most usual for that dialect;
however, forms without the -dji can occur in D (and jiubila does occur
in G) and appear to be syntactically and semantically identical with
the -cfi forms; similarly, -d,i forms do occur in M and, to a lesser
extent, in G. Alternant forms pubald,ina and pubilad,inangu have been
observed used instead of jmbalad,ina and jmbilad,ingu respectively. A
morphological analysis of this paradigm is provided in 6.2.
   Normal labels ' first person' and * second person', ' singular', 'dual'
and * plural* will be used below to refer to pronouns.
Dyirbal pronouns are typically Australian - see 1.5. The -$> that occurs
especially strongly in the D dialect, appears to be an idiosyncrasy; it is possible
(although there is no real evidence) that it is related to the -(jt)4in that must
be suffixed to a simple genitive noun or pronoun before any further inflection
is added. G has a special idiosyncrasy (that is not shared by any surrounding
language) in that the second vowel of the second person dual form is -i-. The
* self and spouse' pronoun, in M, has not been reported for any other language
in this area.","[74, 75]"

280                       y.4 Statistical support for phonological description  There are a large number of possibilities at medial (C2) positions.
Considering those words with just a stop at first C2, relative probabilities
a.re *               b 0-29       d 0-16      d; 0-26      g 0-29
And for those words with just a nasal at first C2:
                m 0-40      n 0-21      ji 0-15      y 0-24
 It will be seen that apico-alveolar stop and nasal (d and n) are seldom
 found root-initial, n is often found root-final, and n and d have fairly
 average probabilities of occurrence in word-medial position.
    Homorganic nasal-plus-stop clusters are several times more common
than non-homorganic clusters; the three types of non-homorganic cluster
 (nb, no]) and ng) are about equally common - each occurred about thirty
times in the 2,200-word vocabulary sample. Nasal-plus-nasal clusters
 are very rare: ten words involving an -rim- cluster occurred in the
sample; -nji- and -ny- clusters were each represented by a single
 root.
    Quantitative considerations are relevant to a discussion of certain
 cases of possible ambiguity. For instance, the ergative/instrumental
inflection on to a nominal ending in a nasal is a homorganic stop plus
 -u. Thus it is -bu on to a nominal ending in -m. But there is also the
universal affix -bit 'only' (6.7.2). Encountering a form biirgu[umbu
 (bayi burguium 'jumping antJ) we might thus not be able to tell whether
 it was in nominative inflection plus affix -bu 'only', or in ergative/
instrumental inflection. There would in fact be the possibility of
 ambiguity in such cases. But it will be seen from the figures given
 above that -m is the least common root-ending segment - only about
 2 % of nominals (none of these being very frequent ones) end in -m.
We could say that the chances of this ambiguity coming up are so small
that the language ' tolerates' it.
    However, the ergative/instrumental inflection of a nominal ending
 in -y would presumably be -giiy identical with the dative inflection.
 This would be a serious syntactic ambiguity, and would be less likely
to be resolvable by 'common sense' considerations than the -bit one.
 In fact no Dyirbal root ends in -y. We could say that the possibility
 of so serious an ambiguity is NOT tolerated by the language; and that
to avoid it Dyirbal does not allow any nominal to end in -y.
Nyawigi, the language to the south of Wargamay, does have nominal roots
ending in -?/: thus Nyawigi bundiy as against Wargamay and Dyirbal bilndiji
'grasshopper* (the form is btindim in Yidin, and bilndi in Mbabaram).

   See also the discussion of -jtd occurring with proper names - 6.1.1.
   If two words differed only in their final segments, each being chosen
from the set /, r, ^, then their ergative/instrumental forms would be
identical. However, this only leads to homonymy in a certain syntactic
function (and Dyirbal, like most languages, tolerates a good deal of
root homonymy) and not to syntactic ambiguity as in the examples
above.","[303, 304, 305]"
"  It is not unusual to find, besides a simple imperative, a continuative
imperative 'keep on doing\
In Pitjantjatjara the simple imperative has conjugationally-determined allo-
morphs -wa ~ 0 ~ -ra ~ -la, whereas the continuative imperative is -nma ~ -ma ~
-rjama ~-nama [Douglas, 1964: 40; Trudinger, 1943: 217]. Other languages
with continuative imperatives include West Torres [Ray, 19076: 35] and
Nanda [O'Grady et al., 1966: 124]. In Mbabaram, the imperative affix -g can
occur either directly on to a verb root, or following the affix -xu ~ -nu which
indicates that the action was * initiated in the past'; in the latter case -xug ~ -nug
has the effect of a continuative imperative.
   One of the most common and important verbal inflections is purposive
-gu; this appears to be related to the dative inflection on nouns,
mentioned in the last section [Capell, 1956: 77/8; Mathew, 1910: 207].
Purposive - which occurs in place of a tense inflection - indicates the
desire to, or necessity of, doing something. The -gu inflection on verbs
is in some published grammars called 'immediate future'; it seems
likely that in many cases 'purposive' would be a semantically more
apt label.
There are other similarities between inflections on nouns and verbs - see in
particular the rather striking list given by Ray [1907a: 10] for West Torres.
   Australian grammars typically feature a number of derivational
affixes: (1) reflexive, which when added to a transitive verbal stem
derives a form that functions as an intransitive stem; (2) reciprocal,
with similar function; (3) causative, deriving a transitive from an
intransitive stem; (4) intransitive verbaliser - added to a noun or
adjective stem this derives an intransitive verbal stem; (5) transitive
verbaliser - also to a noun or adjective stem. (In some languages the
contrast between (1) and (2) is effectively neutralised, with a single
affix having both reflexive and reciprocal functions.)
   There is considerable variation in the forms of these affixes from
language to language; however, the transitive verbaliser fairly often is
or includes -ma-, while the intransitive verbaliser and sometimes either
the reflexive or reciprocal (or both) often are or include -ri-.
In some languages, such as Gumbaingar, there is no reflexive form of the verb
* and reflex action is expressed by the emphatic form of the personal pronoun
object' [Smythe, 1948/9: 74].
i.7   Verb                                                                  17
   It is not uncommon in Australian languages for loan words (particu-
larly from English) to be taken always into the noun or adjective class,
never into the verb class. Thus ' work' may be taken over as an adjective,
but be used as a verb through the addition of an intransitive verbaliser
affix.
   In Australian languages there are as a rule rather few compound
nouns. For some languages the same situation prevails for verbs - the
great majority are monomorphemic. There are, however, languages
that are highly productive as regards verb compounding. For instance,
O'Grady [1970: 849] states that, in Nyangumarda, 'by dictionary
count, simple, i.e. monomorphemic, verbs number barely one hundred,
while complex verbs are many times more numerous; by text count,
the scales are tipped the other way: simple verbs far outnumber
complex'.
Other languages that have a set of productive prefixes, yielding a considerable
number of compound verbs, include Gumbaingar [Smythe, 1948/9: 46-7],
Gabi [Mathew, 1910: 216-17] and West Torres [Ray, 1907 a: 28-32].","[40, 41]"

8.5 Adjective semantics
Dyirbal Guwal is particularly rich in adjectives. Not only are there
adjectives covering all the semantic areas described by adjectives in
English, but Dyirbal has an adjectival opposite for many adjectives,
where English would use a verb form. Thus, the opposite of gunga
'raw' is jiamu 'cooked' (which cannot be shown to be cognate with
the verb jiadjul 'cook'), and the opposite of mugulnba 'whole' is yagi
'broken, split' (which is not cognate with verbs xulbal'split' orgayjid,al
'break' etc.).
   A particular feature of Guwal is the wide range of meaning of
wuygi 'no good'; this can be seen by listing its contraries, wuygi can
mean ' not good for its purpose' as against djigil' good for its purpose';
or 'old (material object)' as againstgujtu 'new'; or 'not strong or sweet
(e.g. tea)' as against guli 'strong and/or sweet'; or 'old (person)' as
against a variety of terms for 'young woman', 'middle-aged man' etc.;
or 'ill' as against bambun 'getting better (i.e. fatter)'; etc.
   There are Dyalrjuy correspondents for most of the important Guwal
adjectives, with some grouping together of concepts - thus there is
#•5 Adjective semantics                                                313a single Dyalrjuy adjective corresponding to Guwal 'sour' and 'bitter',
one for 'hot' and 'dry', one for 'straight' and 'good', and so on. Just
as wuygi has a wider range of meaning than any other Guwal adjective,
so its Dyalrjuy correspondent maygay has a phenomenal range - at
least fifty adjectives and verbs in Guwal have may gay, maygaybil or
maygaymal as their Dyalnuy correspondents. They cover 'stale, deaf
or forgetful, lazy, tired, shaky, coarse (not finely ground), cunning,
cheeky, frightened, broken-hearted or offended, ashamed, stupid,
grumble at, feel ill, etc. etc'
   In some cases Guwal has an 'affect' verb referring to a certain
action, and an adjective for the state resulting from that action. Dyalnuy,
in keeping with its general parsimony, will have a single item. Thus
(inM):
                              Guwal Dyalnuy
            transitive verb xulbal yilgilmal ' (to) split'
            adjective         yagi    yilgil       'broken, split'
            transitive verb jiadjul durmal         ' (to) cook'
            adjective         jiamu durmanmi 'cooked'In the first case Dyalnuy has an adjective, the Guwal verb being
rendered by a verbalised form of this adjective; in the second case
there is a verb in Dyalnuy, the Guwal adjective being translated by the
perfective form of this verb.
  There is another class of adjectives that are analogous to adverbals -
they provide the same semantic qualification of nouns as certain
adverbals do of verbs. Again, Dyalnuy has a single item:                                 Guwal  Dyalrjuy
       intransitive adverbal    wundiy wurgalbil 'do slowly'
       adjective                wunay wurgal     'slow'8.6 Semantics of time qualifiers
Dyalnuy classes together Guwal words referring to 'a certain time
away in the past' and 'the same time away in the future'. That is, it
has ganba for both ' earlier on today' and ' later on today' and ganbagabun
(literally 'another ganba') for 'yesterday (or any further time in the
past)' and 'tomorrow (or any further time in the future)'. (There are
also one or two other, more specific Dyalnuy time words.)
9 LexiconIn this chapter we survey the structure of lexical roots, in both Guwal
and Dyalquy.
   Dyalquy data supports the recognition of a division between grammar
and lexicon: all members of open word classes-that is, all nouns,
adjectives, verbs, adverbals and time qualifiers - have a different form
in Dyalrjuy from that which they have in Guwal. However, all gram-
matical forms - words such as pronouns, noun and verb markers and
particles, and all affixes - have identical form in Guwal and Dyalquy.
Consider the following sentence in Dyalquy (text reference XVIII:
35):
(683) bawalbi pupmarigu      wujidjdgun bagumayganangu        jialmarugu
      madjirabiyugu
and its translation into Guwal:
(684) yana buialaygu wujid,agun bagumayganangu Jtalygagu jtinayugu
      go and look [to see] where all the children are camping!
These sentences involve the following correspondences of lexical roots:               Guwal       Dyalquy
              yanu(l)      bawalbil       'go' (see 9.2.1)
               buxal      jiupmal         'see, look at'
              jialyga     jialmaru        'child'
              jtinay       madjirabil     'sit, stay, camp'The interrogative noun marker wuji^agun, and the quasi-pronoun
balamaygan (here in -pa plus dative form) are common to (683) and
(684). Note that the informant providing the translation put bupal into
-yay form, to correspond to a false reflexive form of jiupmal (on this
see 9.2.1).
  Dyalquy interrogatives also support the grammar/lexicon distinction.
The interrogative pronoun wap(u\d) and noun/verb marker wupd,a-
have identical form in Guwal and Dyalquy - these roots range over
                                  [314]
g.i Structure of Guwal roots                                               315
grammatical classes. However, the interrogatives which belong to lexical
classes - based on mijia and wiyama roots - have different form in
Dyalrjuy.
D Guwal has wiyamay/l and M Guwal wiyabay/l; the forms are reversed in
Dyalrjuy - thus D Dyalrjuy has wiyabay/l, and M Dyalrjuy wiyamay/l. Dyalrjuy
mindir corresponds to Guwal mijia i what' in both dialects; both mijtay ' when'
and mijiap, 'how many' are rendered by minay in Dyalrjuy (cf. 6.6).
   There are two exceptions to the statement that particles are unchanged in
Dyalnuy. Dyalrjuy rjurjify corresponds to Guwal rjuri in both D and M;
Dyalnuy mumba corresponds to Guwal mugu in M (4.15.3).
   In M Dyalrjuy only, the form tjulap is brought in between a noun or verb
marker and a bound form (only) - thus yaluyulajidayi, bayiyulajigalu, etc.;
tjulaji carries no meaning - the M informant said it was needed ' to complete
the language'.
   Interjections have the same form in Guwal and in Dyalnuy with one
exception: maya G, yimba DM 'no, no more' is in Dyalrjuy (jagin G, djilbu DM
(4.17).","[336, 337, 338, 339]"
"5.8.2 Pronoun cases. In 5.2 we showed that, despite the case marking
on pronouns, the syntax of Dyirbal followed an entirely nominative-
ergative pattern. However, we still have to explain pronominal in-
flections.
   This can be done in terms of the feature [ +actor]. The case marking
convention (/?') applies in the case of pronominal NPs just as it does
for non-pronominal NPs. But whereas the inflections of nouns depend
only on case marking, pronominal inflections take account not only of
case but also of the polarity of the [actor] feature. Thus, in the case
of the first person singular pronoun, for instance (compare with the
paradigm in 3.3.1):(cxii) REALISATION RULES
                                    its pronominal head has the form:
         if the NP has features:          in G            in D
      [1] [nominative] and [ +actor]     yayba            yad,a
      [2] [ergative] and [ +actor]       Va4a             yad,a
      [3] [nominative] and [ — actor]    yajia            yayguna   It will be seen that for singular pronouns in G there is a different
form corresponding to each combination of case and actor features.
In D and M however (and for non-singular pronouns in G) there is
a single form of each pronoun, used in [ + actor] NPs, IRRESPECTIVE OF
THE CASE MARKING.
   Realisation rules (cxii) explain why there is only one type of -yay
construction involving pronouns, although there are two varieties
involving nouns (point [7] in 5.1).
  In the case of nouns we have (cf. (481), (483) etc.):

that there is NO pronominal form corresponding to the features [ergative]

6.7 Universal affixes
There are three affixes that can occur with almost any type of word.
6.7.1 -ru. Affix -ru, following a vowel; -aru, following a consonant.
This cannot be given any effective English gloss; however 'another'
and 'again' covers part of some of its meanings. -ruf which follows all
other affixes, occurs with at least the following:
   [1] number adjectives; thus bulayi' two', bulayiru' another two' -6.1.7.
   [2] pronouns, e.g. yindaru bant 'you (can) come too!'; and quasi-
pronouns, e.g. balagararu.
   [3] noun markers; in D -pa must precede -ru. Thus D bayijiaru
bant, M bayiru bant or bayijiaru bani 'he (can/must) come too!'.
   [4] some particles, e.g. ajid,a-szz (668); D d,amu, M yurmu ' j u s t ' -
see 4.15.3, and:
(658) yurmu yaq]a bayi banijiu I just came here (i.e. did nothing else)
(659) yurmuru yaq]a bayi banijtu I just [want to] keep on coming here
and yuri 'in turn' (this is a D example):
(660) jiuradji yuriru yuriru budi You(all) carry [the children], turn and
       turn about
  [5] verbs in unmarked tense inflection (indicating that an action
happens twice):
(661) bayi badjijiu balayj yad,aru balaygayul bad,ijmru he fell down
      there; I too fell down at the same place
Versions of (661) in which -ru is attached to yad,a but not to baq]ipuy to
badjijiu but not to yad,a> or to neither, are all quite acceptable.
  Note alsoyalamanaru 'do the same thing again'.
  [6] adjectives - thus midi 'small', midiru 'smaller'.
   [7] nouns - as in bayi yaya banipuj djugumbilaru banijiu 'the men
are coming and the women are coming too'.
  [8] most of the bound forms bay (ft, gali etc. The affix has the form
6.y   Universal affixes                                                 267-ru ~ -aru in D, -ndu ~ -andu in certain varieties of M (probably Waribara)
and -gu~-agu in other types of M (probably Dulgubara). Thus,
bawalaru refers to a distance further than bawal; and:
(662) r)aa]a yanu baluguya I'm going (to) there across the creek
(663) yaq]ayanu baluguyagu I'm going (to) there across another creek
It appears that baydpru refers to something NEARER than baydji 'short
distance downhill'; thus baydjiru is used for 'underneath', etc. bayd,a
'medium distance downhill' cannot occur with -ru. baya]uru refers to
a distance FURTHER than baydju 'long way downhill'. Similarly with the
other sets of bound forms. Here -ru appears to be an intensifier: a
shortER or a longER distance. (See also 6.5.7.)
   [9] interrogatives - -ru often serves to derive a negative from an
interrogative/indefinite root. Thus the interrogative pronoun plus -ru
has the meaning 'no one' (text reference vn: 3):
(664) wajidju bayi yapn who answered him?
(665) wajtdjUru bayi yapn no one answered him
  Similarly, a zviyama form plus -ru will mean ' can't do it'; in fact
the form wiyamaliru often has the sense ' don't like to do it':
(666) gijiabawal                yad,ayaa]ilman          \   idla
       THIS-NOM-IV-LONG WAY I-SA lose-INSTR-PRES/PAST jala-Stick-NOM
      wiyamaliru          Va4a bayali    yinuj
      do what-PURP-n* I-SA sing-PURP you-GEN
      payola
      d,arjala-style songs-NOM
      I've lost this ^ala-stick; now I can't sing d,ayala songs for you
(667) yad,a gijian wuygij wiyamaliru balabalaj lubimali [now] I'm old
      I can't/don't like to eat meat [any more]
(668) yanamawuygibalamj wiyamaliru ajid,aru yu^bilij yanama budi take
      away this useless food; I no longer like to taste it; carry it away!
  Care must be taken not to confuse the universal affix -ru with [1] the
ergative inflection, -ru, on the verb in a relative clause; and [2] the
'motion' affix -ru, that occurs with allative and locative nouns (3.4.6)
and is incorporated into verb markers balu and yalu (6.5.1).
-ru appears to have some semantic similarity to the comparative affix -baza.
It is likely that native speakers recognise -ru and -baza to provide different
kinds of qualification of an adjective. But bilingual informants did translate
both midiru and midibaza as 'smaller', and then said that midiru referred to
something smaller than did midibaza; midibazaru 'very much smaller* is also
268                                                       6,y   Universal affixes
quite acceptable. Note that -baza occurs only with adjectives, nouns, and
bound forms bay^i etc.
6.7.2 -bu. The affix -bu 'only' (in D and G, not in M) can be added to
(at least) a nominal form, a noun marker, a pronoun, a verbal form,
or a time qualifier. It is always added AFTER any case, tense or other
inflectional ending. Thus:
(669) yapaygubu bala budin only men brought it (i.e. women had no
       hand in it)
(670) bayi wayalbilabu banipuj biginyaygay the man is coming with
       boomerangs only, not with shields
(671) gijia yumayubu bala bay a that belongs only to father
(672) bandagay bayi jiinayu balayj yudaygabu bayi yanu he'd been
       living there for years, he left only the other day
(673) giramaybu bayi wurbajtu he only speaks Giramay
(674) yadja maymijiubu I was only visiting (to be given) food
-bu occurs with verbs predominantly in G (to a far lesser extent in D).
A further example of ~bu is in text xxxib, line 28, p. 386. See also (646).
   With noun markers and pronouns (but not with nominals) -d,ilu
must come after -bu.
   -bu does not occur in M; an informant variously used -mumbay, -a]u
(~ -d,ilu)y particleyurmu, andjtamuy ' do on one's own' (which is probably
another particle), when translating into M sentences from D involving
-bu. Thus (673) was translated as:
(675) bayi giramaybu wurbajtu he speaks only Giramay
and (669) was translated as :
(676) yayaygu jtamuy bala budin only the man brought it
6.7.3 -bu -bi can be affixed to nouns, noun markers, demonstrative
markers, pronouns, verbs and time qualifiers. Informants sometimes
used 'too' in the translation of sentences including -bi; -bi often occurs
in questions:
(677) bayinbi banigu is he coming as well ?
but can also occur in many other types of sentence, -bi occurs in all
three dialects but is particularly common in G.
In some instances -bi appears to have a similar meaning to -ru. Thus yindaru
and rjindabi might both be glossed 'you, too...'. Roughly, -ru appears to
mean ' a second participant' as against -bi ' this one as well \ rjindarubi bani is
attested, with a meaning something like * do you want to come too, in addition
to the others?'.
7 PhonologyEach Dyirbal sentence has both a grammatical and a phonological
description. The phonological description consists of a number of
* phonological words': each of these is based on a single ' word class'
root, the phonological form of the root undergoing phonological addition
or alteration corresponding to (optional) stem-forming or derivational
processes and (obligatory) inflectional processes.
   The word as a phonological unit is marked by an initial stressed
syllable, final inflectional ending, and a fixed form: that is, the
'constituents' of a word cannot be permuted within the word. There
is, however, considerable freedom of the order in which words can
appear in a sentence (7.8).
   Each word is a sequence of phonological segments, a segment being
a set (or 'bundle') of phonological features; each feature belongs to
a phonological system. A single statement of possible word structures
can be given (covering words of all grammatical types). The possible
phonic realisations of each phonological feature are described (RELATIVE
TO the realisations of the other features in the system).
   Dyirbal words tend to be phonologically rather compact: that is,
certain phonological processes of insertion, assimilation, elision and
conflation act to ensure that, say, a consonant cluster is not only one
of the ' possible' clusters for the language, but is also one of the more
frequent or 'popular' clusters (7.5). There is no phonological cohesion
(sandhi and so on) BETWEEN words.
   Within a word the phonological possibilities at morpheme boundaries
(say, between a root and a stem-forming affix, or at a reduplication
boundary) are wider than the intramorphemic possibilities.","[290, 291, 292, 293]"
"   Lists as heterogeneous as the above might be taken to imply that
allocation of nouns to the four classes lacks any principled basis - that
there are so many exceptions to any general statements (such as 'snakes
308                                                    8.4 Noun semanticsand fishes are class I, birds class II') for the latter to be of little use.
However, speakers do not appear to have to learn the class of each
noun individually, but rather to operate with certain general principles.
As a further clue, loan words are immediately assigned by different
speakers to the same class.
   It will be seen that if we approach the question of the semantic basis
of the classes in a rather more subtle way than by just asking * what
types of object belong to each class?', then we can reveal a quite
principled basis of allocation.
   Class membership can largely be explained in terms of (i) certain
basic concepts associated with the various classes, and (ii) certain rules
(for transferring class membership).
   The basic concepts associated with the classes are:
   class I (bayi): animateness; (human) masculinity
   class II (balan): (human) femininity; water; fire; fighting
   class III (balam): edible vegetables and fruit
   class IV (bala) is a residue class, dealing with everything else
The rules are:
   (1) If some noun has characteristic X (on the basis of which its
class membership would be expected to be decided) but is, through
belief or myth, connected with characteristic Y, then generally it will
belong to the class corresponding to Y and not that corresponding to X.
   (2) If a subset of nouns has some particular important property
that the rest of the set do not have, then the members of the subset
may be assigned to a different class from the rest of the set, to 'mark'
this property; the important property is most often 'harmfulness'.
   Humans are always specified for sex; other animate beings are not.
Thus all (nouns referring to) human males are class I; all human females
are class II. Animals, snakes and lizards, insects, fishes are class I by
virtue of their 'animateness'. But birds are believed to be the spirits
of dead human females; by rule (1), on the basis of this believed
(human) femininity rather than on the basis of their actual (non-human)
animateness, birds are class II. However, certain birds are excepted
from this (and are not included under the generic term balan dundu
'bird'): these birds have, as individuals rather than as a class, mythical
associations. Thus three willy wagtails are believed to be mythical
men, and are class I. The satin bird is in a myth the bringer of fire
(from the clutches of the rainbow-snake): fire is in class II, and so is
the satin bird. And similarly in half-a-dozen other cases.
8.4 Noun semantics                                                            309   Fishes are mostly class I; but two particularly harmful fishes, the
stone fish and the gar fish are, by rule (2), class II. In this as in other
cases there is interrelation with other criteria for semantic grouping:
stone fish and gar fish are not included in the scope of the generic
bayi d,abu 'fish' (the other fish that is not covered by the generic term
is in class I - bayiyad,ai 'stingaree'). Trees, bushes, vines, and grasses
with no edible parts are class IV; but the two stinging trees and a
stinging nettle vine are, by rule (2), class II. Hawks, the only birds that
eat other birds, are in class I by rule (2), whereas the majority of birds
are in class II.
   Anything connected with water and fire (including light) is in class
II. But the moon and sun are, in mythology, believed to be husband
and wife: by rule (1) the moon is class I and the sun class II (the stars
are, by their connection with fire, class II). Wind, having none of the
positive characteristics * animateness', ' fire', * water', * fighting',
'edible', is class IV. But storms and the rainbow are believed to be
mythical men, and are class I, by rule (1).
   Anything connected with fighting is, as a rule, class II: most fighting
implements and the fighting ground itself. Thus fighting spears (which
are also used for hunting kangaroos, etc.) are class II. But multi-pronged
spears, used solely for spearing fish, are (like fishing line) class I, the
same class as fish. And big short spears are, like yamsticks, class IV.
(Note that Dyalrjuy has a single term for 'yamstick', 'big, short spear',
'woman's fighting stick', and 'echidna spikes'.)
It should be noted that rule (1) assigns the class of an item. Rule (2), as stated
here, indicates that an item should belong to a different class from that
expected, but does not specify which class. In examples of the application of
rule (2): if a set of nouns is not class II, then a 'harmful' subset of the set is
class II; if the set is class II, then the harmful subset is class I. There are
insufficient examples, however, to justify incorporating this in rule (2).
   Rule (2) might be stretched to explain the inclusion of 'bees' and 'honey'
in class IV; everything else animate is in classes I or II. Honey provided the
only real sweetness the Dyirbalrjan knew, and was the basis of the only drink
they had besides water (a weak honey solution - Roth, 190 ib). Honey, and
bees, thus had a unique and important status for the Dyirbalrjan. Note also
the special semantic status of 'honey' in the Worora language of the North
Kimberleys. Here noun class I refers to 'males, articles made by or associated
especially with males', and class II to 'females, articles especially connected
with females, and also sweet things such as honey' [Capell and Elkin, 1937].
  The class-concept associations and the two rules do provide a simple
and efficient explanation for the general organisation of the nouns
310                                                      8.4 Noun semanticsinto classes. They do not, however, explain all particular instances.
For example, crickets are class II by rule (i): in myth crickets are
'old ladies'; the scorpion balan malayigara may be class II because of
its recognised similarity to balan yigara 'crayfish* (an informant
explained that a scorpion is like a crayfish with a large hand attached,
cf. bala mala 'hand*-9.1.2); the firefly is class II by its association
with fire, and the hairy mary grub by its association with the sun (the
grub's sting is said to feel like sunburn); but it is not known why dog,
bandicoots, platypus and echidna are class II, rather than the expected
class I. Again, balan bima 'death adder* is probably class II, rather than
class I, by its mythical connection with balan gurbuiu 'seven sisters'
(believed to be a 'death adder in the sky')-rule (1); but it is not
known on what grounds balan munilan, balan marigal' chicken snakes'
and balan yunba 'water python' are class II when all other snakes are
class I. (Note that other water snakes are class I.)
   Some unexplained individual class memberships may be due to the
writer's lack of familiarity with some relevant myths or beliefs. But it
seems likely that some are WITHOUT EXPLANATION (as would be the
case in any natural language: some may have had an explanation in
terms of an earlier stage of the language, but the class assignment has
been retained and the explanation lost as the language has altered).
However, the class-concept associations and the two rules do explain
the vast majority of noun class memberships - a great deal of which
appeared at first sight to be heterogeneous and without explanation.
   The class I/class II correlation with male/female is obligatory for
reference to humans; it can, exceptionally, be used to refer to the
sex of an animal. Each name of an animal normally has fixed class
membership (class I or II, except for bees, class IV). Thus balan guda
(class II) 'dog', bayiyup (class I) 'kangaroo'. But in order, exceptionally,
to point out that a certain dog is male bayi guda can be used; similarly
balan yup to indicate that a certain kangaroo is female. Thus for dogs
'male' is the marked sex and 'female' unmarked; for kangaroos
'female' is marked.
Speakers of Dyirbal can also refer to the sex of animals by using nouns that
normally refer to human relations, etc. Thus a female bird will be called
yabu * mother* and a male wiru 'husband'; a female snake can be called bulgu
'wife* or yabu> and a male wiru; female dog, kangaroo, horse and cattle can
be called gacfin 'young girl* and the male of these species yaxa 'man*. Note
that in referring to humans d,ugumbil is the opposite of yaxa, bulgu the opposite
of wiru and bartjan ' young boy' probably the opposite of garfin.
8.4 Noun semantics                                                           311
    Speakers of Dyirbal are able to 'manipulate' noun class to draw
 attention to unusual phenomena. Thus, in all normal circumstances
yaia 'man' can occur only with the class I marker, bayi. However, the
writer heard balan ya%a used jokingly to refer to an aboriginal herm-
aphrodite, the user of the class II marker pointing out the female
characteristics of this 'man' (and compare 4.7.1).
    It will be seen that the explanation of the semantic basis of noun
classes in Dyirbal is not simply taxonomic, but involves rules for
transferring class membership; and that it depends on an intimate
knowledge of the beliefs and myths of the people. Three of the classes
are positively specified, in terms of definite concepts, whereas the
fourth class is only negatively specified, as 'everything else'. (It may
be that in any system of noun classes, there will always be one ' residue'
class, similar to class IV in Dyirbal.)
A fair number of other Australian languages have noun classes, with some
semantic and syntactic similarities to the classes in Dyirbal - see Dixon [1968 c]
(from which the above discussion is largely repeated). Kirton [1971: 57-8]
has investigated noun classes in Yanyula along the lines similar to those
explained above and has gained similar results.
8.4.5 Loan concepts. When the Dyirbalrjan came into contact with
European civilisation they extended the meanings of some Guwal
words to cover the new concepts that were encountered. Thus bala
maialu 'hollow log' was extended to cover 'shirt'. In most cases,
however, they took over an English word, suitably cast into the mould
of Dyirbal phonology (9.3.1): thus balan bigi 'pig', bala djUga 'sugar',
balamtyibayga'tobacco', bayi mani 'money'.
   Now we have seen that everything must have a different name in
Dyalrjuy from that which it has in Guwal; and we have also noted that
Dyalrjuy is extremely parsimonious, keeping its vocabulary as small as
possible. Consistent with this, Dyalrjuy most often dealt with loans
by extending the range of meaning of an existing Dyalrjuy term. Thus
balan bigi ' pig' is translated into Dyalrjuy by balan ginga, which was
already the Dyalrjuy correspondent of Guwal balan gumbiyan ' echidna';
pig is assigned the same taxonomic group as echidna (probably because
its tough bristles resemble the echidna's spines), bala d,uga is, by its
texture, called in Dyalrjuy bala waruji, which was already the corre-
spondent of Guwal bala waguy 'sand'. However, no existing Dyalrjuy
item could be extended to cover 'money' and in this case a new word
was introduced into Dyalrjuy: bayi walba. (Of the hundred or so
312                                                   8,4 Noun semanticsnoun loans in Guwal, all but three or four are covered by an already
existing Dyalrjuy term-the exceptions are 'money', ' policeman' and
'pipe'.)
   The allocation of loan words to noun classes is largely predictable
from the concepts and rules given in the last section. Fruit, flour, cake
(made from flour), wine (made from fruit) are in class III; white man
is in class I, white woman in class II; matches and pipe (concerned
with fire) in class II but cigarettes (leaves that are 'consumed') in
class III; sugar is, like honey, in class IV. Most else is in class IV; an
exception is bayi mani 'money' whose referent was unlike anything al-
ready existing in Dyirbal culture, and is (unpredictably) placed in class I.
   Again, noun class helps to disambiguate multi-sensed Dyalrjuy terms
that involve loan concepts. Thus balam d,ubayga 'tobacco' is rendered
by Dyalrjuy balam garmban. bala garmban was already the Dyalrjuy
correspondent for Guwal terms for 'haze', 'mountain mist', 'smoke'
and 'steam'; however 'tobacco' is class III whereas the other concepts
are grouped into class IV. Thus djubayga is assigned a Dyalrjuy
correspondent on the basis of the smoke it produces, but is placed in
a noun class according to the fact that it is 'consumed'.","[331, 332, 333, 334, 335, 336]"
"4.5.2 Topic chains. We can consider any text (conversation, mono-
logue, etc.) in Dyirbal to be underlain by a sequence of simple sentences.
If a number of consecutive sentences in such a sequence have a common
NP, with common referent, then they will form a topic chain: this
entails each sentence being transformed into a form in which the
common NP is topic NP (i.e. is in nominative case). This NP may
only be stated once, at the beginning of the topic chain; optionally
all or part of it may be repeated later in the chain (commonly, just the
noun marker may be repeated). Thus it is quite usual to encounter
a chain of a dozen sentences all 'commenting' on a single topic
occurrence.
Two topic chains may run through a text in * leapfrog' fashion - an example
is in text xxv, lines 108-15 (p. 396).
72                                                4.5 Discourse structuring   For instance, the description of a fight preceding a cannibalistic
killing involved the following typical topic chain:
(108) bayi walmajiu burbula/gubiygu baian\badjigu\bayum bayi/balbali-
       yarajm walmaygujyudu bayan bariygujbugabilij Burbula stood
       up; the gubi punched him, causing him to fall down. And then
       he began to turn over in order to get up. The hollow in the
       back of his neck was hit [by the gubi] with a tomahawk; and
       as a result he died.
This text-fragment (reference xxiv: 39) has been altered by the substitution
of the word gubi for the name of the protagonist; this is to comply with a
promise made to the storyteller.
     Underlying (108) are (bayutn here has time reference, 'and then'):
(109) bayi burbula walmajiu Burbula stood up
( n o ) bayi burbula [baygul] gubiygu bayan the gubi punched Burbula
( i n ) bayi burbula badjigu Burbula was caused to fall down
(112) bayum bayi burbula balbaliyarajtu Then Burbula began to turn
         over
(113) bayi burbula walmaygu in order that Burbula should stand up
(114) bayi burbula xudu [baygul gubiygu baygu] bariygu baian Burbula
         was hit in the hollow at the back of his neck by a tomahawk
         [wielded by the gubi]
(115) bayi burbula bugabili Burbula was caused to die
The implicated VCs in ( i n ) , (113) and (115) should be particularly
noted: implicated VCs are typically encountered non-initially in topic
chains.
   (108) exemplifies topic 'elaboration' and 'reversion'. (109-13)
concern Burbula, as 'situational theme'; in (114) the theme is narrowed
to that part of Burbula's body that is hit - xuduy the top of the vertical
depression between the two muscles at the nape of the neck; in (115)
the theme naturally reverts to Burbula. The topic is shown by bayi
burbula in (109), and by bayi in (112); and the topic elaboration (the
theme narrowing) by xudu in (114), understood as a noun modifying
the head burbula (an example of inalienable possession-4.2.1). There
are no a priori reasons for the topic of (115) being understood as bayi
burbula rather than as bayi burbula iudu\ but, extra-linguistically, it
makes no sense to talk of (just) the hollow in the back of someone's
neck dying. The elaboration is thus understood to be dropped in (115),
the topic reverting to just bayi burbula.
4.5 Discourse structuring                                                       73   If one simple sentence immediately precedes a second simple sentence
in the sequence underlying a Dyirbal text, then the unmarked situational
realisation of their sequential ordering is that the event referred to
by the second sentence happens after the event referred to by the
first sentence. Event ordering that is not one-to-one with simple
sentence ordering may be marked by special time words (4.14 - magul).
bayum, in (112), is here a time qualifier that merely emphasises the
normal one-to-one simple-sentence-to-event correspondence.
   An SA pronominal form, such as yatfa, can be the topic for a chain
of intransitive simple sentences:
(116) rjadjd jiinajiu/bayum walmajiujwayjid/ili I sat down, and then got
         up to go up the hill
   An SA pronoun can also run through a sequence of transitive simple
sentences:
(117) yaa]a bayi ya%a balganjwalmbinjbaygunj^lwan I hit the man;
       lifted [him] up; threw [him] down; [and] kicked [him]
(118) r)ad,a bala yugu yubanjbalan a]ugumbil djilwan I put down the
       stick; [and] kicked the woman
(For pronoun sequences intransitive-transitive and transitive-intransi-
tive, and sequences involving O pronouns, see 5.2.2.)
It should be noted that it is impossible to gap [Ross, 1970] in Dyirbal; that is,
it is impossible to omit the verb in one of two or more coordinated clauses
that have the same verb, and different but comparable subject and object
(in English, for instance, one can say 'Mary bought pears and John apples',
omitting 'buy' in the second clause). A verb must always be included, in each
Dyirbal clause, unless it is a minimal sentence of a type described in 4.5.1.","[95, 96, 97]"
"9.3.2 Syntax of Guwal loans. Loans are taken into Guwal as nouns,
adjectives or time qualifiers, never as verbs. Thus there is an adjective
waga M, wagi DG ' work[ing]' that typically occurs with the intransitive
verbaliser-wagabily wagibil '(to) work'. The adjective madjirim
' mustering' commonly occurs with the transitive verbaliser - madjirimbal
'(to) muster'. There are, however, relatively few loans from English
verbs; most often the range of meaning of an established Guwal verb
is extended to cover a new type of action.
In not accepting loan words as verbs Dyirbal is typical of Australian languages;
see, for instance, R. Hershberger [19646] on Gugu-Yalanji.
9.3 Loan words                                                         3279.3.3 Dyalguy correspondents of Guwal loans. We mentioned in
8.4.4 that in most cases an already established Dyalrjuy word is used
to render a loan item in Guwal. There are a few instances of compound
Dyalrjuy correspondents - thus Guwal bala yaygid,a or bala gaygid,a
' handkerchief' becomes in Dyalrjuy bala djurmbaybarimuya^ literally
4
  that which rubs [itself] a lot* (tfurmbaybalis the Dyalrjuy correspondent
of Guwal verb djUral 'rub').
    Examination of Dyalrjuy correspondences continually throws new
light on problems in the analysis of Dyirbal. The word for flour (being
introduced into the language with the advent of flour, in the late nine-
teenth century) is balan gaygamali. Now bala gayga is 'eye', and
gaygamali could be a purposive form of transitively-verbalised gayga:
literally 'in order to make an eye'. However, this seemed semantically
implausible and informants were unable to shed any light on the
matter; the writer at first assumed that the similarity was merely
coincidental. But then the following Guwal-Dyalrjuy correspondences
were uncovered:
                         Guwal                    Dyalrjuy
                bala gayga ' eye'             bala diyal
                balam gaygamali ' flour' balatn diyalmali
                balam damba ' damper'           balam diyal
                balam gaygi ' cake'            balam diyal
Damper may possibly have been termed diyal in Dyalrjuy since at
a certain stage of its preparation it must look something like an eye:
a hole is made in the middle of a mound of flour, and water poured in;
it is then kneaded for some time from the centre. In any case the name
for flour in terms of an analysis into diyal plus -mali (= gayga plus -mali)
now seems entirely reasonable. The identification of 'damper' with
'eye' could not otherwise have been guessed at (damper was very
common in the early days of settlement but is hardly known nowadays,
although of course flour is much used for other purposes) but is quite
explicit in Dyalrjuy.
This analysis is supported by an analogous example from the present day.
In the last few years the Dyirbalnan have been able to buy dried apricots
from the local store: the children refer to these as maya ' ear \
  Note also the Guwal noun bala d/inaman ' boot, shoe' - cf. bala
djina 'foot'.

Speakers of Dyirbal are excellent mimics - by comparing their imitations
of the calls of various birds etc. with the names of the birds, it was
possible to establish that just over half the Guwal names for species
of bird, locust and cricket are onomatopoeic.
  A sample of sixty-two birds etc. yielded twenty-eight names that
are completely onomatopoeic - that is, the full phonological form of
the name occurred in the imitation. These included:  balan a]ia]uluruy i forest kingfisher'        balan guyur i brolga'
  bayi cfigirtfigir ' a willy wagtail'         bayi dagu i hammer bird'In some cases the name formed only a part of the imitation; thus the
call of balan badjindfla D, balan badjindjUadjila M * satin bird' was given
as \bda^na]ilaq^laaHlaaHla\
   Four names involved partial onomatopoeia - that is, part of the
name was recognised in the call:                         name                             call
        balan dpwujiu 'pink-chested kingfisher'

languages; kookaburra is called by a variety of names, almost all of which
begin with gu-.","[350, 351, 352]"

"9.1.2 Noun roots. Three kinds of 'structure' can be recognised for
noun roots:
   [1] There are a few compounds, made up of two simple roots:
  balan malayigara ' scorpion'            balan yigara ' crayfish'
                                         bala mala 'hand'
  bala djinaguda 'a softwood tree'         balanguda 'dog'
                                         bala dpna 'foot'
Informants explained that a scorpion looks like a crayfish with a big
hand, and that the djinaguda tree has a leaf that looks like the foot of
a dog.
   [2] There are a fair number of nouns the first part of which is
identical with a disyllabic root:
  bayigubimbulu 'very clever man'         bayigubi 'clever man' (see 2.4)
  bala garimal' summer-time'              balan gari ' sun'
318                                              g.i   Structure of Guwal roots  bayijbalan d,ulbu%uy ' married             bayijbalan d,ulbun ' recently
  person'                                  married person'
  balan guwugipfyu ' ibis'                 bala guwu ' nose'
  bala maialu ' hollow log' D              bala maya ' snake or rat hole'
  balayugari 'hollow log' G                [cf. balayugu 'tree, wood']
  bala djinari 'root under water'          bala djina 'foot'
The second parts of these roots cannot be positively identified with
anything else in the language. Thus, there are no forms -bulu, -puy or
-gip4u > ^ is possible that the -mal in garimal is related to the transitive
verbalising affix (and see the discussion of gaygamali in 9.3.3). We
suggested in 7.7 that the -lu in mapalu may be historically related to
the affix -ru 'along, through'. It may be that the -ri in yugari and in
djinari goes back to a productive affix from some earlier stage of the
language (that may also have combined with roots bala> yala to give
the allative of direction forms bait (~balari)> yali (~yalari) - 6.5.1).
   Tribal names are of a similar construction:
                       tribal name         language name
                       djirbalyan            djirbal
                       giramaygan             giramay
                       rjadjandji            yad^an
Further examples are in 2.2, 2.3; -yan, -gan (which appears unrelated
to the feminine ending discussed below) and -dji do not recur in other
types of compound in the language.
   A number of kinship terms occur in two forms - a short form, and
a longer form obtained by adding -ndi or -{]t)4^ to the short form.
-ndi is added in the case of 'mother' and 'father' and -(jt)rfa in the
case of terms for grandparents, parents' siblings, and parents-in-law
(-p4a i s added after a vowel, and -d,a after ~n)- Thus:
               yuma          yumandi          'father'
               yagi          yagijifa        ' mother's father'
               waymin        waymind,a        'mother-in-law'
The difference between the two sets of terms is obscure.
   [3] Some nouns involve the affix -bara 'someone who is concerned
w i t h . . . ' (6.1.1). Thus there are institutionalised names for two spirits:
   bayi yugubara 'a bad spirit' (literally 'man of the woods'; from
       balayugu 'tree')
   bayigububara 'a friendly spirit, about a foot high; he is put in a dilly
g.i Structure of Guwal roots                                          319
     bag by a traveller and whispers or whistles to him, warning of
     any unseen danger ahead' (literally 'man of the leaves', from
     balagubu 'leaf')
   The names for the five hordes of the Mamu tribe, and the name for
the tribe speaking Gulrjay, involve -bara - see 2.2.
   A few nouns appear to involve the feminine affix -gan (1.6). These
comprise the section names (2.4) and:
   balan yalygayngan' single woman (when beyond usual marrying age)';
     cf. bayiyalygay 'single man (when beyond usual marrying age)'
   balan d/ulbungan ' a woman who follows her promised man - the man
     and woman have been promised to each other in marriage, but the
     man is too shy or frightened to claim his bride, and she is forced
     to go to him'; cf. bayi/ balan djulbun 'recently married person'
See also bayi mugu' mother's elder brother; and balan mugunan' mother's
elder sister'.
   A considerable number of nouns appear to be in reduplicated form;
however, the unreduplicated roots do not exist in the present-day
language - examples were mentioned in 7.3, 7.5.1 (see also 9.4).
yambiya, DG 'what's it called* (there is no corresponding form in M) may
be historically related to rjamball hear \9.1.3 Adjective roots. A few adjective roots appear to be cognate
with verbal forms:
              adjective root                  verb root
        wugid^a ' generous'              wugal' give'
        gunda ' inside'                gundal' put inside'
        gard,a ' alright'               gard,ul' do properly'
        majid^ay ' hunger satisfied'     majid,ay ' eat vegetables
                                       when hungry'
        miyay 'smile'                  miyanday 'laugh'
The first three verbs are transitive and the last two intransitive. The
adjective majirfay is identical with the participial form of the verb
(4.6); however, it is nowadays felt to be a full adjective root, with
a meaning rather different from that which the participle would have
-majid,aybil 'to be satisfied' is a common verbalisation. There is no
intransitive verb 'go in' and verbalisation gundabil is very common,
as the opposite of mayil 'come out'. (See 10.3.4 f° r a discussion of the
prehistory of verb root wugal.)
320                                               g.i   Structure of Guwal roots   There is also an adjective wudubalu ' going straight on, blindly,
without looking back', which can plausibly be derived from bala wudu,
G, 'nose' and balu 'to a place in that direction' (literally 'nose going
to a place in that direction'); wudubalu occurs in G, D and M although
the word for 'nose' in D and M is balaguwu.
   The number adjective 'three' in M is warapuygul (6.1.7) - this could
be analysed as the particle war a 'the wrong thing, a strange thing'
(4.15.3) plus yuygul 'one', with an n inserted and the impossible
sequence -ny- replaced by 77-7.5. (By this analysis warapuygul would
be, literally, 'strange one'.)
   From yalamay 'do it like this' are derived adjective yalamay 'like
this' (e.g. yad,a yalamay bayi> 'he's the same sort of man as me') and
yalamaynbara 'thing or state which is like this one', which can function
as noun or adjective - 6.1.1. There is also yalamaypd,a{y) 'at the same
time' - 6.4.
There were very few non-simple roots in the two to three thousand word
vocabulary of Guwal that the writer collected during his first field trip. Further
work since then has revealed an increasing number of compound words; it is
likely that a full investigation of the ten thousand or so words that are likely
to comprise the everyday working vocabulary of Dyirbal would uncover
a considerable range of complex roots.","[341, 342, 343, 344]"
"5.3.4 Implicative relation - implicated VCs. We have still to
consider implicated VCs. An implicated VC typically occurs non-
initially in discourse, usually non-initially in a topic-chain. From the
examples in 4.4.3 it will be seen that the action referred to by an
implicated NP happens BY VIRTUE OF something referred to by an earlier
segment of the topic-chain. Consider (based on text xv, line 52, p. 377):
(450) bala             barmba        batjgul       marjgan             /
      THERE-NOM-IV quartZ-NOM THERE-ERG-I pick Up-PRES/PAST
      bayguli      dibanda j bulabili
      bash-PURP rock-LOC two-iNTR VBLSR-PURP
      the quartz was picked up by him, and bashed on a rock, so that
      it split into two
Here the picking up of the stone by the actor was a necessary preliminary
to his bashing it on the rock; and the bashing caused the stone to split
into two.
   The purposive inflection of verbals in an implicated VC is plainly
5-J   Underlying syntactic relations                                    145the realisation of some syntactic relation holding between the implicated
VC and something earlier in the topic chain in which it occurs. We
will postulate that this is the same underlying relation as that used
to explain implicative NPs. There remains the question of WHAT
implicates a VC. There are two main candidates:
   [i] We could say that a VC is implicated by the immediately
preceding VC in the topic-chain. Thus, in (450) we would have, in
addition to the instances of universal deep relations:
(xxx) [maygal ->- baygul]
(xxxi) [baygul ->- bulabil]
  [2] We could say that a VC is implicated by the topic NP (or, in an
embedded sentence, the secondary topic NP). Thus we would write:
(xxxii) [bala barmba ->- baygul]
implying that it is the topic, by virtue of its past history in the topic-
chain (here, the fact that the stone has been picked up by the man)
that makes possible, or implicates, the action of 'bashing' in the chain
of events. Similarly:
(xxxiii) [bala barmba ->— bulabil]
indicates that it is the history of the topic at this stage of the chain
(the fact that it has been bashed on a rock) that is responsible for the
action * breaking into two' entering the chain of events.
   However, an implicated VC can occur in the first sentence of a topic-
chain, producing a perfectly grammatical sentence. For instance (cf
(88-9) in 4.4.3):
(451) balan d,ugumbil miyandaygu woman wants to laugh (i.e. some-
      thing has happened to make her want to laugh, and she will
      have to restrain herself to avoid doing so)
(452) bayi yaia yanuli man has to go for some reason
If we insisted that VC implicates VC, some non-purposive VC would
have to be generated for (451-2), and then deleted. It is plainly more
satisfactory to say that the topic NP in each sentence, by virtue of the
extra-textual history of its referent, implicates the VC.
   Further evidence is provided by the informant's reactions to (cf.
(90-1) in 4.4.3 and the discussion there):
(453) balan d,ugumbil baygul yayaygu balgali
(454) bayi yaya bagun d,ugumbilgu balgalyaygu
146                                       5-J   Underlying syntactic relationsThese have a degree of synonymy - both refer to ' a man hitting a woman'.
However, the unmarked interpretation of (453) is that the woman
voluntarily allowed herself to be hit; in (454) it is that the man hits her,
probably against her wishes. It seems that if the FIRST sentence in
a topic-chain includes a VC in purposive inflection, then the topic is
somehow responsible (as 'implicator') for the action happening.
   We thus say that it is a topic (or secondary topic) - and the topic's
past history: either its textual history in the topic-chain, or the extra-
textual history of its referent, or a mixture of both - that ' implicates'
aVC.
   We have concluded that (1) a dative NP is to be regarded as 'impli-
 cated' by a topic (or secondary topic) NP; and (2) a purposive VC is
to be regarded as 'implicated' by a topic (or secondary topic) NP. The
grounds for saying that the implicative relation is 'the same' in the
two cases are:
   [1] In each case the implicator is either a topic or secondary topic;
there seems to be a syntactico-semantic common factor of ' implication'
involved, the difference between the two subtypes of implicative
relation being exactly what would be expected with the implicated
phrase nominal, in the one case, and verbal, in the other.
   [2] There is plainly a close syntactic connection between implicated
NPs and implicated VCs. It is true that a sentence can involve an
implicated NP but no implicated VC, and vice versa. However, we
mentioned in 4.4.3 that if the VC in a -yay construction is in purposive
inflection then the O NP MUST be in dative inflection; thus ^(92), for
instance, is ungrammatical. Further, all VCs beyond the first in an
iterative chain must be in purposive form; this clearly correlates with
the fact that all NPs in an iterative chain, beyond those in the first
sentence, must be in dative case.
   [3] There is phonological similarity. The dative inflection on
implicated NPs simply involves the addition of -gu to a stem; the
purposive inflection on implicated VCs involves the addition of -gu to
a -y stem, and -i to an -/ stem.
It is worth noting that in Wargamay, the language most similar to Dyirbal
(and in many other Australian languages), there is no -i alternant, purposive
inflection involving the addition of -gu to a stem of either conjugation.
  [4] An implicative relation, commonly marked by -gu inflection on
both nouns and verbs, has been noted (by other investigators) in many
other Australian languages - see Capell [1956: 77] for a general survey.
5-3   Underlying syntactic relations                                           147What is particularly revealing is that the identity between nominal
and verbal -gu has been commented on in some of the grammars that
have been written by people with a native-speaker command of a
language. For instance, John Mathew, who was brought up amongst
the Gabi and had an excellent command of the language, remarks ' the
termination -go is used both with nouns and verbs, thus dhuri-go
bam-go yan-go, ""to-the-scrub for-eggs going"". It sometimes means
""motion to"", sometimes ""purpose"", being, in the latter case, equivalent
to English "" f o r "" . . . ' [Mathew 1910: 207].
See also Ray [1907a: 10], and the quotation from Lumholtz in 4.5.1.
   In conclusion, we have suggested that, in addition to the universal
syntactic relations, (v) and (vi), we must recognise a third deep relation
for Dyirbal:
(xxxiv) [X->-Y]
where X is an NP that also functions as outermost NP in an instance
of one of the two universal relations; and Y is either an NP or a VC.
It is likely that the implicative deep relation, (xxxiv), will be needed
to account for the underlying syntax of most or all other Australian
languages.
   In the next sections we attempt a transformational grammar
explanation of Dyirbal syntax. It is clear that one of the main require-
ments on such a treatment be that it show and explain the similarity
between implicated NPs and implicated VCs.
   In this section we have discussed point [17c] from 5.1.","[168, 169, 170, 171]"
"On extra-linguistic grounds (90) is hardly a sensible sentence. If a sentence
includes a VC in purposive inflection it is implied that the topic of the sentence
was somehow responsible for the event taking place (5.3.4) - often, that the
topic desired it. Thus (91) is totally acceptable - the man gave the woman
a beating that in his opinion she deserved. However, the unmarked interpretation
of (90) is that the woman voluntarily allowed herself to be hit, an unlikely
circumstance that caused informants to be unhappy about this sentence. With
a more suitable verb the difficulty - which does not affect the grammar, although
it sheds considerable light on the grammatical difference between (90) and
(91) - would not arise. For instance:
(93) balan 4ugumbil barjgul yaxaygu bayalt woman had to be sung to by man
(94) bayi yaxa bagun d,ugumbilgu bayalrjaygu man had to sing to woman
would be equally acceptable.
70                                                4.5 Discourse structuring4.5 Discourse structuring
4.5.1 Minimal sentences. Besides transitive and intransitive sentence
types (4.1) and sentences transformationally derived from these (4.4.2),
quasi-elliptical versions of these sentences occur quite normally in
Dyirbal. But there is one requirement that any sentence must satisfy:
it must contain a topic NP (that is, an NP whose words are in nominative
case).
   Thus we can have a transitive sentence where the 'actor' is left
unspecified (cf. (26), (31)):
(95) balan djugumbil balgan woman is being hit [by someone]
(96) yayguna balgan I am being hit [by someone]
or a -yay sentence in which the 'goal' is left unspecified (cf. (67), (69),(97) bayi yaya balgalyajm man is hitting [someone]
(98) yad,a balgalyajm I am hitting [someone]
  Sentences (95-8) were judged perfectly acceptable by informants.
We can explain their grammaticality either by saying that all non-
nominative NPs are to be marked in the grammar as optional, or else
by including an optional rule that deletes them. In contrast, many
sentences that contain no verb at all are heard; these often have just
a nominative and a dative NP:
(99) bayi ya^a bagul bargangu man [is going out] to concern himself
      with wallaby
or even:
(100) bayi bargangu (as (99))
Informants would not accept sentences like this as good Dyirbal
(although they agreed that they occurred) but insisted that a verb was
needed. We can distinguish between the general acceptability of (95-8),
and the relative unacceptability of (99-100), by saying that the latter
involve discourse ellipsis, the former grammatical ellipsis.
Amongst the many similarities between Dyirbal and its southerly neighbour
Wargamay can be counted the occurrence of sentences that include an
implicative NP but no verb. The Norwegian zoologist Carl Lumholtz lived
for a year in 1882/3 amongst what must have been the Wargamaygan tribe.
In Among Cannibals [1889: 308] Lumholtz remarks: 'The suffix go literally
means ""with regard to"", and is usually added to nouns to give them a verbal
meaning, but it is also sometimes added to verbs. The question Wainta
4-5 Discourse structuring                                                  71Morbora?- that is, ""Where is Morbora?"" - can be answered by saying only
tityengo (he has gone hunting tityen) (wallaby), (literally, with respect to
wallaby); or, for example, mittago he is at home (literally, with regard to the
hut). Mottaigo means ""he is eating"" (literally, with regard to eating). ""Throw
him into the water"", is expressed simply by ngallogo. As is evident, this is
a very convenient suffix, as it saves a number of moods and tenses.. .' Of the
words Lumholtz cites (fifyngu and rjalugu are clearly in dative case; mid,agu
