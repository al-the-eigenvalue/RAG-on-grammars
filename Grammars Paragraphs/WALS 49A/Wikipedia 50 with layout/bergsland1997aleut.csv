analogue (probably a relic) in Eastern Aleut: yu- vi. ‘to run out, pour out, spill’, vt.
‘to pour out; to spill’, while Atkan has the normal Aleut pair hyue vi. vs. hyu-t- vt.     oblique cases of nouns changed also the verbal valency system. The transformation
(Aleut kum-, the cognate of Eskimo kuve-, is only transitive: ‘to pour’).                  appears to have left some specific traces.
        The regular Aleut analogue of an Eskimo agentive one-place verb in a reflexive              A few intransitive verbs with the otherwise transitivizing suffix -t- seem to
sense is a transitive verb with a reflexive pronoun as an object (3.2.1.2.), e.g. txin     be relics of non-agentive verbs in the reflexive sense, while their transitive counter-

kayak’, CAY mumigt-uq ‘it turned over’ vs. mumnigt-a-a ‘he turned it over’; Aleut          vs. sit-i- ‘to break, smash to pieces’ (also with an extra transitivizer -t- : old Atkan
(inaqaam) txin asxatikug ‘(he himself) killed himself’, (inaqaam) sabaaka-an               sifit-); chif-t- ‘to become wet’ vs. chif-i- ‘to dip’, cf. chif-ni- ‘to wet, make wet’,
astatikut ‘he (himself) killed his (own) dog’, asRatikuu ‘he killed it’, CAY ellminek      vr. ‘to get wet’; ha%-t- ‘to stand up, get up’ vs. ha®-i-t- ‘to lift up, to raise’. With a
tuqutug ‘he killed himself, committed suicide’ (CSY without the ablative pronoun)          specified object, as in ukuusxi-& sigi-na-% ‘he broke a/the window’, the transitive
vs. tuqutaa ‘he killed it/him/her’. The Aleut verbs are simply transitive, admitting       derivative could possibly reflect a half-transitive use, while the anaphoric version,
any pronoun or noun as an object.                                                          siti-qa-a ‘he broke it’, could reflect some adversative use, cf. Greenlandic asiru-i-vuq
        In Aleut, the non-agentive verbs naturally got lost as a category together with    ‘he breaks something (e.g. titurfim-mik a cup)’ vs. asirur-pa-a ‘he breaks it’, and
the ergative construction, which got lost with the loss of the oblique cases of nouns.     asiru-i-va-a ‘it (object) broke for him (the subject)’ vs. asirur-pug ‘it is broken’.
                                                                                                   In a number of cases the transitive -i- is opposed to an intransitive -a- (see

0.1. Historical survey
         The documented history of the Aleuts, in their own language Unangan, in
the dialect of Atka Unangas, begins with the conquest of Attu, the westernmost of
the Aleutian Islands, by Russian fur traders in 1745. Forty years later the Russian
traders dominated the entire chain of islands and a large part of the Alaska Peninsula
(in Aleut Alaxsxa, the origin of the name Alaska), including parts of the territory of
the Pacific Eskimos called by the Aleuts Kanaafin, in Atkan Kanaagis, Koniags.
The Russians called all these people Aleuts, Russian plural Aleuty, a name report-
edly transferred in 1745 by pilot Nevodchikov from the name of islands near
Kamchatka (article XVII of the instructions for the Billings expedition 1785 in
Sarychev 1802 and Sauer 1802, Appendix p. 45), cf. the Koryak village Alut, in
Russian    Olydtorskoye     (further references    in Bergsland     1959:11;    Lantis
1984:183).
        The border between the Unangan and the Kanaagin on the Pacific coast
according to Veniaminov (1840 I:231 / 1984:116) was Kupreanof Cape, in Aleut
Alaxsxim Yaga ‘Alaska Cape’ or Yaagam Yaganaa ‘Tree Cape’ (1910, J 17:24),
about 1060 nautical miles east of Attu. On the north coast of the peninsula the bor-
der was in the region of Port Moller.
         At the time of the Russian conquest there were probably more than two
hundred Aleut settlements or villages (tanadgusin, tanadgusis) along the coasts of
the Alaska Peninsula and the larger Aleutian Islands. According to Russian sources
from the period 1768-1840 and some later information (references in Bergsland
1959:11-14), the people were divided into the following eight groups (the names are
given here in the modern orthography):
          (1) Qagaan Tayagungin ‘People of the East’ (at least thirty-four settle-
ments): the people of (a) the Alaska Peninsula (Alaxsxa); (b) the Shumagin Islands
(Qagiifun); (c) Sanak Island (Sanaagin pl. Samwell 1778) and the islets north of
it (Qutxin); and (d) Unimak Island (Unimax) (according to Veniaminov 1840 II:2 a
separate group, pl. Unimgi[ijn).
         (2) Qigiigun “Near-Easterners’ (some forty settlements): the people of the
eastern part of the Fox Islands, viz. the Krenitzin Islands - Ugamak (Ugangag),
Tigalda (Qigalga), Avatanak (Awatanag), Akun (Akungan), Akutan (Akutana),
Unalga (Unalfa) - and the eastern part of Unalaska Island (Nawan-Alaxsxa, Nagun-
Alaxsxa, Awan-Alaxsxa, Agun-Alaxsxa), from Sedanka Island (Sidaanag) through
Wislow Point (Tachiqala) northwest of the modern Unalaska Village (so Veniaminov
1840 II:3 and H. McGlashan of Akutan to G.H. Marsh 1952).
         (3) Qawalangin [qawa- ‘east, east side’] (at least twenty-eight settlements):
the people of the western part of the Fox Islands, viz. the western part of Unalaska
Island and Umnak Island (Unmax) with Samalga (Samalfga).
         (4) Akuugun ‘Those Over There (to the side)’ (eight settlements): the people
of the Islands of Four Mountains (Uniigun), notably Chuginadak Island (Tanat
Angunag ‘Big Island’, the eastern part, and Chuginadax ‘Simmering’ with Mount

    By suffixation, a noun may be turned into a verb or vice versa. Many stems,              mining the direction of the conversion, however, and the nominal use of a verbal
including some derivatives, are ambivalent, both nominal and verbal, but the am-             stem may be difficult to distinguish from the suffixless tense called general (2.1.9.3.1.).
bivalence may also be viewed as suffixless conversion.
    The valency of a verb may be changed by suffixation, a subject or an object              2.2.1.1. Verbs converted into nouns
