       Quality       is     expressed               by    either           an     adverb        or        a    nominal                        and in some constructions,  like  (220b), the noun form is used
derived           from     that        adverb.            The        adverb        is        also     usually              a                  without the denominalizer,  so that’it’ functions as a discon-
derived           form.         Thus:                                                                                                         tinuous paratactic construction with farantxe.

Introduction      Hixkaryana                is    a member         of    the       Carib          language            family      and        is
spoken        by        groups        currently            located          on    the        rivers        Nhamunda             and
Mapuera            in    northern            Brazil,        about       halfway          between            Guyana's
southern  border                     and     the     Amazon.           Today          there        are     about          350
speakers.                                                         :
       The    most           recent         classification              of       the    linguistic               sub-
divisions               of    the     Carib         family       is    that       of    Durbin            (1977),          based
on comparative phonological studies of a number of Carib
languages.    Hixkaryana is included in his     'Southern Guiana
Carib'  grouping,    one of the four divisions of Guiana Carib.
The Guiana land mass includes Venezuela,      Guyana,   Surinam,
French Guiana,    and Brazil north of the Amazon.      Most Carib
languages are found in this area.      The Southern Guiana group                                                                      is
part of the major division which he calls       ‘Southern Carib',
which also includes Carib languages in Southeastern Colombia
and in the Xingu basin of central Brazil.        The other three
Guiana groups are placed in 'Northern Carib’.
       I    have        recently            shown     Hixkaryana             to       have     a    basic        word       order
of a type which had been generally thought to be nonexistent,
namely Object-Verb-Subject    (Derbyshire,  1977b). The present
study is, therefore, probably the first major description of a
language of this type;   a further work will attempt to draw some
tentative conclusions as to its typological significance
 (Derbyshire, forthcoming).    Since the word order facts of
Hixkaryana               have become  known,  research                                has produced   evidence
suggesting               the  strong possibility   of a                               similar  basic word order
in several other languages     (Derbyshire  and Pullum,    forthcoming),
and it is of interest that two of them are Carib languages
which belong to Durbin's     'Southern Carib!   division:   Bakairi
 (Wheatley,   1973) and Hianakoto-Umaua   (Koch-Grtinberg,   1908).
 (Three other Carib languages for which O-v-S is claimed to be
basic are in Durbin's    'Northern Carib’   division:   Apalai,
Makusi,   and Panare.)
  - The       Hixkaryana               appear         to    be    direct          descendants               of      the     Babui
 (Wabui),           reported           by     Friar        Francisco             de    SAo     Marcos          in    1725        to
have        moved        from        the     river     Trombetas             westward              to    the     Nhamunda;
.Since that time the various Carib-speaking groups in this
 region have been collectively referred to in the literature as
 Parukoto-Charuma  (Frikel, 1958).  Until very recently the name
 Hixkaryana pertained to just one of several clans   (-yana
 ""kinship group'), who referred to themselves in general simply
as totokomo  'people'.     They had a common    language,   with  only
minor dialectal   differences,    and were   scattered   across a large
area of Amazonian   jungle between’ the river      Jatapu  to the west
and the river Mapuera    to the east.     Some  of the clan names
appear in the literature as                                 distinct tribes,                       e.g. Sherewyana,
Kamarayana,  and Yukwaryana.                                 Fifty years ago                       their total popu-
lation        may        well        have     run     into       thousands,             but        they     were      decim-
ated by disease                      until, about 25                  years ago, they were in danger
of extinction.                       About that time                  they came together to form two
main        groups:           the     Hixkaryana,            on       and    near       the        middle        reaches          of
the        river        Nhamunda&,           and     the    Sherew,          who       have        been     living          with
another   Carib   tribe,    the Waiwai,    in southern   Guyana.  Since
then  their   numbers    have   increased.   In the  last five years   most
of the Waiwai     and Sherew have moved        to the river Mapuera   in
Brazil,        and        there         has       been       much     more           frequent        contact       between               among     the    Hixkaryana;        to   Kaywerye    and    many        other    Hixkaryana,

    My wife     and I lived with    the Hixkaryana    for various    periods
between    1959    and 1975,  amounting    to a total  actual   residence    of
about   seven    and a half years.      My principal   language    informant
in the early years       was  Kaywerye,    then in his   twenties,   and we
lived     in       his        village,            Kasawa,          during            the.whole        period.           All        the
Hixkaryana  on the Nhamunddé,  who had                                           formerly   lived in               several
scattered  villages,  have moved   into                                          Kasawa   during the               course  of
the     last       few        years,          and      in    April        1977        the    population           of    the
village        was        237         (the     other         approximate
                                                                       120                     speakers          are    the
Sherew on the Mapuera).
    In this description I use the local orthography         (except that
& is replaced by £ to avoid confusion for the linguistically-
oriented reader).      The orthography was introduced only fifteen
years ago, but the. Hixkaryana are now very familiar with it and
many of them can read and write with ease.          The main emphasis.
of the book is on syntax.        This requires a full treatment of
the morphology,    but the phonology is given in somewhat abbrevi-
ated form.     The literal translations which are given for the
forms cited are handled in two ways:        there is a precise
morpheme-by-morpheme      translation when this is required to
illustrate the particular feature under discussion          (mainly in
the Morphology section);      elsewhere   (mainly in the Syntax
section)   more general meanings are given for each word;         thus
the’    word       rotahatxowns                   is     translated              either:           (precise) ©           .,
rotahatxown:t                 (r-otaha~txowni                      IIISIO-hit-dist.                  past    compl.
coll.)   ‘they   hit me';  or  (general)                                     rotahatxowni   they-hit-me.
    I would   like   to acknowledge   my                                    thanks  to those who have
helped in significant ways in the preparation of this book:   to
Geoff Pullum at University College London, who has always been
a stimulating influence and has also advised on many details;
to Bernard Comrie,  one of the joint authors of the Lingua
Questionnaire,  who went through the first draft manuscript with
a fine toothcomb and made many helpful suggestions;   to our.
colleagues               in     the     Summer           Institute              of    Linguistics           in    Brazil,
who     have       given         linguistic                 advice         and       much     practical          help

      The    only     processes         by     which        adverbs     can     be   derived      from
adverbs relate              to the negative derivations -hira    (see
2.2.4,.1-2) and             -mra  (see 2.2.1.5 and 2.2.4.1(vi));   there                                 is
only one type of adverb                      with which -mra occurs, the derived
adverb -txahke, and the                      negative is formed by changing that
suffix to -txakomra  (see 2.2.1.5 and 2.2.4.2(iii));   the
occurrence of -htra in the derived adverb forms -henyehra and
-kenyehra is described in 2.2.4.1(vii)  and (viii);  it also
