o.t   ‘THE DIOLA PEOPLE
The Diola (Dyola, Jola) live on either side and near the mouth of the Casamance River
in the region of Senegal, West Africa, known as the Basse-Casamance. ‘There are ap-
proximately 200,000 Diola sub-divided, according to Thomas (1958), into ten groups,
eight of which are found on the left and two on the right bank of the river. ‘The majority
of the Diola live in small independent villages and practise wet-rice cultivation.
0.2   THE DioLa LANGUAGE
Diola makes up a dialect-cluster with considerable inter-village variation. ‘The accom~
panying map indicates the spread of the different dialects as well as the distribution of
Bainouk, a neighbouring language spoken in isolated pockets throughout the region. It
is Kennedy’s opinion (personal communication) that the Buluf variant will, upon further
study, prove to be three or four separate dialects.
   Within the Diola cluster there are two important dialects, Fogny and Kasa (Casa),
which are structurally quite similar, and which, sociologically speaking, can be thought
of as variants of ‘standard’ Diola.
   Kasa is spoken in and around the town of Ziguinchor, the regional capital, and in a
number of scattered areas to the west. It is used and understood throughout all of the
 Diola region south of the Casamance.
   Fogny corresponds to the ethnic sub-group of the same name and is spoken by about
 85,000 native speakers in the area around Bignona. This dialect is understood by prac-
tically all Diola. Radio Dakar (the Senegalese national radio) uses Fogny in its Diola
 language broadcasts.
   The Diola group joins at some genetic distance with Bainouk and such languages as
 Manjaco and Balanta (spoken in Portuguese Guinea) to form, in all probability, a sub-
 section of the Western Atlantic Branch of the Niger-Congo family. ‘The Western Atlantic
 Branch includes such other languages as Serer and Wolof (spoken in Senegal), Coniagui
 and Baga (spoken in Guinea), Temne (spoken in Sierra Leone) and the far-flung Fulbe
 (Peul, Fulani).
 0.3 Diora Lancuace Srupirs
 Aside from occasional word lists, only two extensive studies have ever appeared on
 Diola: a grammar and dictionary of the ‘Carabanne’ dialect (which seems to be equivalent
 to Kasa) published in rg09 by R. P. Wintz, and a grammar and lexicon on Fogny pub-
 lished in 1940 by R. P. Weiss. Wintz’s study gives a good account of the noun-class
 system, but fails, because of Latin conceptualization, to give a clear picture of the rest of
 the language. His dictionary is substantial and appears to be quite accurate. Weiss’s
 grammar, though accurate and well-conceived, tries to cover too much ground in too
 little space. Unfortunately he gives only a French~Fogny lexicon. I have occasionally made
 use of some of his grammatical examples.
    ‘The Rev. Kennedy has written a short unpublished sketch of Kasa, as well as a brief
 discussion of Diola dialects (1964) and Huluf noun classes (1963). W. A. A. Wilson, in
 two survey articles (196rb, 1963) touches on Diola (Huluf dialect) noun classes and
 numeration.

any other class except for a few plurals marked with class 4 and except when the theme is
marked as a diminutive (below F.), as an augmentative, or as a collective (7.112). In one

  The 3/4 pair is comprised of concrete objects, including a majority of the animals and
most loan words that are not persons, fruits, trees, containers, or bony objects. A few

referring to sub-standard people.

frequently used as an optional prefix in a number of the concord forms: ku pil bukoke or kupil koke
‘the children are here’. Comparisons    with neighbouring languages make      this class a probable
survival.of an older a/buka class set for personal nouns. In the Kwa:tay dialect, there exists an
a/ baka set with corresponding concord for a good many, but not all, basic personal nouns. Further,
in Balanta, a more distantly related language spoken in Portuguese Guinea, the concord marker
before vowels for the personal plural (ba) class is bak (Wilson, 1961a:161).

    A. The alternation of augmentative and diminutive pairs and the Class 13 (ba-) diminu-

 type of paradigm:

                                    singular         plural             collective

 When applied to persons the augmentative alternations have a pejorative connotation.
   In cases where a theme, by using more than one prefix pair, has several meanings, the
 diminutive-augmentative alternations are limited. For example, the theme -bo:r can be
 used
   with a class pair 9/8 to mean ‘tree/trees’, and with 3/4 or 5/6 to mean ‘large stick’
                                                                                     , ‘log,’
 or ‘broken-off branch’ (singular or plural). In this instance the alternations produce only:
                                  singular             plural
      augmentative                —                    pibe:r ‘large logs’

An adjective must be used in order to complete the semantic paradigm:
     buba:r bomak          ‘big tree’
     ubo:r wameak          ‘big trees’
     eba:r yomak           ‘big log’

     siba:r sati:t        ‘small logs’

give an analogous augmentative meaning.

  There are two sets of mutually exclusive optional noun suffixes: definite articles and
possessives.
   7.131 Definite article: The definite article consists of a- plus the class consonant. In
three cases where the class is marked only with a vowel, classes 1, 3, 8 (a-, €-, u-), the
definite article is -aw, -ey, and -aw respectively (3.24). All of the definite articles, except
class 17 (wa-) and those without a class consonant, may optionally suffix one of the demon-
strative vowels, usually the indefinite -u (6.11).

   3 eyency          ‘the dog’
   4 slyenas(u)    = ‘the dogs’

  17 warabarabaw      ‘before dawn’
  18 tinoket(u)       ‘the moment’ (definite article was not accepted by Sindian informants)
The single member of class 19, din ‘place within’, cannot take a definite article.
  7.132 Possessive suffixes: The personal markers which serve in nouns as possessives
and in verbs (10.21) as object complements are as follows:
     =m         ‘my’                -ola ~-olal ‘ours (incl)’
     “|         ‘your (sg)’         -uli ~-olj    ‘ours (excl)’ (regional variants)

                              MORPHOLOGY             AND     SYNTAXThere is a distinction which seems to have died out between an inclusive dual and plural
1st person, a distinction which seems to include not only the person markers but also the
disjunctive possessive and subject/object pronouns (6.2) and the discontinuous subject
verb affix (10.12).4 For the person markers the respective forms are ->la and -lal. Since
these two forms parallel exactly the morphophonemic alternation V~VI (3.7) observed,
in the case of person markers, for-> ~ -3l,-u ~-ul, and-i: ~-il, the disappearance of the
dual indicates a morphophonemic structure interfering with a semantic contrast.
   All my informants, whose ages range from 20 to 30 years, denied the existence     of the
contrast. However, in a series of conversations between two elders (aged about 75) the
contrast appears to have been made. In two instances between words, and once within a
word, the predicted morphophonemic forms did not appear and from the context it was
certain that the two old men were distinguishing dual from plural. Further, although all
other instances of the plural inclusive followed the expected morphophonemic pattern,
none contradicted the dual-plural distinction implied by the context of the conversation.
   Instances where the morphophonemic alternation was ‘violated’ did not involve the
person markers, but instead the disjunctive subject/object pronoun and the suffixed sec-
tion of the bound 1st person plural inclusive subject marker.

       wala usofam         ‘we take care of’ (dual context)
  Some examples where the dual-plural context parallels the ——e                               expecta-
tions are:
      emitey ekatolam         ‘God leaves us’ (dual context)
      birin walakaikun        ‘since we were small’ (dual context))
      jamamay yololal         ‘our times’ (plural context)
      etc.
The last example appeared in phrase final position where the use of -a ~ -al is in free
variation. In the recording, the -al of yololal was particularly clear.
   (Part of this text appears in the appendix.)
   Other evidence comes from Weiss(p. 421) and from Kennedy (personal communication).5
Weiss has this to say: ‘lorsqu’il s’agit seulement de deux personnes, on dit ola au lieu de
olal. Ex: ola kugaba ola: nous deux’. Kennedy was kind enough to furnish me with the
following: “The dual inclusive plural certainly exists and is often used, but (the informant)
consistently insisted that the more common -al form can always be used in its place even
“The neighboring dialect of Kwatay has a very distinct first person dual-plural contrast. It is formally
distinct from the Diola version. For example:

*Since the MSS has gone to press there has been no further evidence on the survival of a dual
inclusive in Fogny. This is with the exception   of one Sindian informant who contrasts a disjunctive
subject/object dual-trial inclusive with a plural inclusive.

sindeolal but later changed his mind and said that two people could say sindeola.’
  (Kennedy’s informant was about 35 years old.)
  The subject/object class form C> (7.21) can be used, in contrast with the disjunctive
possessive (7.35), a8 a weak possessive paralleling the personal markers. Since there is
seldom, if ever, clear junction between the noun and the Co form, the latter           can be
considered as a ‘postclitic’,

   7.14 DISTRIBUTIVE NouN FORMATION
   A distributive noun can be formed by reduplicating completely a neutral theme plus
its noun class marker. Such forms take neither definite articles nor bound possessives. A
distributive may be positive or negative depending upon the verb with which it is associated.

  7.21 Supyect/Osyect PRONOUNS
  7.211 All of the personal pronouns, except the two 3rd persons, are independent
themes. The 3rd persons are based on the concord pronoun Co (7.212).
      inje                            1st person singular (‘I, me’)
      aw                             2nd person singular (‘you’)

      ko ~ buko                      3rd person plural
The archaic buko (cf. note 1 (7.111(A)) is used quite as frequently as ko.
      inje imanjut buk>              ‘I don’t know them’
      uli aw uwaluli                 ‘you (sg) gave birth to us (excl)’

      > di walal ujukuta ko           ‘he and we (incl) didn’t see them’
   7.212 The subject/object pronoun consists of the noun class marker plus > (joined
together with appropriate assimilation (3.21)). This concord pronoun (except class 2) can
also be used as a noun possessive marker (7.132) and, under certain circumstances, as a
bound verb complement (4.52).

  7.221 There are three interchangeable variants to the interrogative pronoun: Cey ~
Cay ~ Cay ma. The forms Cey and Cay can be followed, for emphasis, by the invariant
form amban, which, when used independently, has the meaning of ‘why?’.
  These interrogative forms, which are class bound, should be contrasted with the general
seminominal interrogative wa (7.62).
      apitem ta:tu ay                ‘who is chopping there?”
      bukey nujuke                   ‘whom did you see?”
      umu ay amban                   ‘who is this?’
      yantomi yay ma                 ‘what is that (class 3) which is there?’
  7.222 The combination of the general pronoun Co and the interrogative Cey produces
an interrogative locative pronoun CoCey which is always glossed as ‘where is it? (etc.)’.
Class 1 has the form omey (3.21, 3.24). This locative is in free variation with the form
bey Com which consists of the independent seminominal interrogative (8.1(A)) plus the
defective -em (4.581(A)). When referring to the 2nd person plural the form jojey is used.
CoCey is used only in concept juxtaposition constructions (4.721).
     kuseki bukokey                    ‘where are your (sg) wives?”
     jilibaj jumbe jojey               ‘where is my knife?’

                                                                                                      mainly with themes referring to tieing, closing, covering, etc. Thus -lo:p ‘have cord tied
Other examples would be: -riben           ‘follow’ in:                                                around the neck’ gives -lo: pul ‘untie cord from around neck, undress’, -bab ‘close’ gives
      peniribenum uja:maw wola            ‘I will follow (him) by means of his tracks’                -babul ‘open’, and -fim ‘be turned over’ gives -fimul ‘uncover’ (compare -fimen ‘cover’)
which contrasts with:                                                                                    A number of other forms also use the reversive. In these cases, however, the semantic

relationship between the root and its derivative is at all clear. In one of these the two
forms have the same gloss: -bol ‘grill, roast meat’, eboia ‘heat, etc. gives -bolj ‘be hot’
(referring to the sun), feel sympathy for s.o.’, and -mor ‘sleep, be asleep’ gives -morij
“ditto gloss’. Some other examples: -lebj ‘be heavy’ from -leb ‘be straight’, kalj ‘be drunk’
from -kal ‘be partially ripe’ and -kajj ‘be ugly’ from -kaj ‘have one leg shorter than the
other’.
  5-225 ‘appear’: The suffix -alenor, which combines with only two recorded themes,
glosses as ‘appear, show’. The theme -ank ‘be strong, hard’ gives -ankalenor ‘appear
strong, makean effort’ and is used primarily as a verb auxiliary (12.121). The other form
comes from -ju:t ‘be sick’: -ju:talenor ‘appear sick’.

a series. It optionally takes the definite article.
      sjlu:pas sjlamu:ke:s       ‘the last houses’
      elu:pey elamu:kay _— ‘the last house’7.37 NEUTRAL THEME ADJECTIVES
  All neutral themes can function as adjectives. Their formation as such varies, however.
There are four basic types:
  A. Those formed by juxtaposition and without any accord whatsoever. (These can be
thought of as reduced genitive phrases (9.12).)
  B. Those formed by ordinary concord agreement, i.e. those that follow the pattern of
other concord forms.
  c. Those formed with a relative pronoun (7.41).
  D. Those that may be formed by either methods B or c.
Themes that function as nouns normally use methods A or B; themes that function as
verbs use method c, and themes that function almost exclusively as adjectives use method
D. There are very few themes in this latter category. There is always considerable varia-
tion between Bignona and Sindian speakers as to the assignment of specific themes. Thus
when the theme -lu:p ‘house’ is used as an adjective it is assigned to A by Sindian speakers:
     butun elu:p § ‘house granary’
and to B in Bignona:
     butun bulu:p
And in another example the form -njne ‘male’ is assigned to B in Sindian:
     eyenenine        ‘male dog’
and D in Bignona:
     eyen enjne ~ yanine
   Constructions formed by ordinary concord may optionally take one of the following
suffixes: the definite article (7.121), or the abstract derivative -ay (5.112) with or without
definite article. Thus the pattern:
                          $
     CV + theme +        sc
                          ay + (-aC)
Those formed by way of the subject relative pronoun obligatorily take one of the following
suffixes: the simple subordinate marker mi (4.533) (thus forming a subordinate clause
(12.131)) the noun emphasis marker (4.533), or a definite article. Thus the pattern:     Ca + theme +        .
                             -aC
Those forms that take both the CV- and the Ca- concord (category D) optionally suffix
the definite article:
     CV

7.41 RELATIVE PRONOUNS
  7.411 The relative subject pronoun consists of the morpheme -a- prefixed with a class
consonant. It is prefixed directly onto the verb theme. Personal forms ordinarily take class
 1 or 2 depending on the number. The singular personals and the 1st person plural can
optionally, when the regent noun is present, dispense with the relative pronoun altogether.
The 2nd person plural optionally takes ka- or ja- as its relative pronoun.
     kupilak karinulsm — ‘the children who arrive’
     eyeney yagonse          ‘the dog that is mad’ or ‘mad dog’
     muyu kakilum            ‘you (pl) who own’
     muyu jambom             ‘you (pl) who are there’ (<ja-+-em-++-bo-+-m) (3.221)
     Injenom                 ‘I who am’
     inje ambom              ‘I who am there’
  7.412 The relative object pronoun consists of the morpheme -an~~ani prefixed with a
class consonant. It is placed directly before the subordinate verb subject which may be
simply a bound verb prefix or an entire noun phrase. When the verb is impersonal the
pronoun is prefixed directly to the verb theme.
     buba:rab banilsen       ‘the tree that I fell’
     ela:ley yan ndaw asek> apuren     ‘the chicken that Ndaw’s wife brought out’7.42 GENITIVE PARTICLE
   The genitive particle Cati ~ Ceti (3.222) is invariant. In certain expressions, however,
the form Cata is used. This is actually a dialect variant and is common for the Fogny of
Bignona and for the Carabanne or Kasa (Wintz, p. 57; Kennedy, 1963:109) dialect.
     kunjnak kati esukey           ‘the men of the village’
     finonkap peti fujamaray     = ‘the cold of (the) rainy season’
     ata sembe                     ‘(person) of strength’ (refers to God)7.43 QUANTITY INDICATOR
   The quantity indicator Coni or Cond (the latter for Bignona) is invariant. The Cono
version brings to mind the defective verb -nd ‘be like, exist’ (4.581 (B)).

Infinitives always take a noun class prefix and can optionally suffix a definite article or
person marker, The two suffixes can co-occur.
   The infinitive noun class marker is usually predictable. Forms of one syllable take class
3 (€-) and those of more than one syllable take class 7 (ka-).
     ega             ‘to throw’                     kajijiren   ‘to cause disorder’
     cis             ‘to show’                      ketiker     ‘to be without’
  In certain unpredictable instances class 7 is prefixed to one syllable themes. It may
here contrast with class 3 or be in free variation with it.
     kapos           ‘wash laundry’      compare: epos          ‘was sth.’
     kabazk          ‘grow taller                 eba:k         ‘be tall’
                     and/or older’
     ka~enu:l        ‘weave (in preparing roof)’
     ka ~ eku:mb     ‘be overcast (sky)’
   A number of common themes (usually primary) functioning as infinitives take class
markers other than 3 and 7. Classes 5 (fu-), 9 (bu-), 10 (ji-), rz (mu-), 13 (ba-), and 16
(ja-) were recorded acting in this capacity. When these ‘irregular’ themes function as
nouns they usually use the same marker. All of these irregular forms that have a one-
syllable theme will take, without change in meaning, the regular Class 3 prefix. This alter-
nation, though accepted by all informants, was never observed in actual practice.
     furi             ‘to eat, food’
     jibom           ‘to dance, (a) dance’
     musis           ‘to be salty, salt’
     bunits          ‘to have sexual intercourse (animal)’ (cmp: kapito ‘to climb’)
     basang          ‘to court, courtship’
     jawac           ‘to swim’
  Whenever the discontinuous derivative -ul ‘towards the speaker’ (5.215), a person
marker, a definite article, or any combination of these three is suffixed to one syllable
neutral themes marked with class 3, the marker remains invariant.
     ebajey           ‘to have (specific)’ (<-baj ++-ey)
     ecamoliey        ‘to pay us (excl)’ (<-cam-+oli+¢y)
     etjtul           ‘to exchange (at a removed place)’ (<-tit+ul)
     etebuljey        ‘to carry you (sg) from (specific)’ (<-teb-+-ul-+-i-+ey)
                                   7.6 SEMINOMINALS
7.61 TIME AND PLACE LOCATIVES
   Seminominal time and place locatives subdivide formally into noun-like forms, con-
cords, and independent themes, ‘The noun-like seminominals are forms of two or more
syllables with initial atonic phonemes that parallel noun class markers. Their reference
is always specific. For the sake of convenience, I have considered these initial phonemes
as disfunctional noun class markers. (They never enter into a concord series, the sine
qua non of a class marker, and thus cannot be called functional). Several facts suggest
that they actually are noun class markers. First, one form shares a neutral theme with

                          A GRAMMAR         OF DIOLA-FOGNYseveral nouns: bu-lay ‘next year’, cf. ba-lay ‘sun’, fu-lay ‘day’, ku-lay ‘days’. Secondly,
another form, in a manner similar to nouns, alternates its class markers in order to
achieve different meaning: fa-tum ‘underneath’, ba-tum ‘between the legs’. Thirdly, one
form functions as either a noun or as a place locative: balamu:k ‘back’ or ‘in back of’. And,
finally, all of the forms can be assigned to one of the existing classes.
   A number of the forms, especially the time iocatives, optionally take the derivative
suffix -aray (5.122), and four of the time locatives take the time position suffixes (6.12).
   From available information place locatives take class markers 13, 14, and 18, while time
locatives take markers 4, 5, 7, 9, and in one instance, 18. Some examples are:
  class     4 (si-)      sunken        ‘last year’ (<si-+-unken)
            5 (fu-)      fuken         ‘yesterday’
            7 (ka-)      kajom         ‘tomorrow’
            g (bu-)      bujom         ‘morning’

                         tutularay     ‘afternoon’
   The concord locatives, of which there are six, act as independent concord forms (8
(a-F)), and, within the limitations imposed on seminominals in general, their function
and distribution is identical to these forms. A special set of concord place locatives
regularly take the demonstrative suffixes (6.11). (A fuller discussion of concord locatives
follows directly in chapter 8.)
   Only a few locatives formed with independent themes were recorded. They all refer to
unspecific time.
     jfia~ per ~ peme ~ ipe           now
     pemeneme ~ ipeine               ‘soon’, just now
      nana ~ nanin ~ nona            ‘in former times’
      jat                            ‘today’7.62 INTERROGATIVE: wa
   The seminominal form wa asks for the specification of an object rather than its differen-
tiation as in the case of the concord interrogative Cay (7.221). The difference between
the two is roughly similar to the English contrast of ‘what?’ versus ‘which?’ (or, ‘who?’).
Thus, in a sentence constructed with a concord interrogative we might have yey nubaje
‘which one do you have?’ with some member of class 3 as understood. In contrast, the
sentence wa nubaje ‘what do you have?’ has nothing understood.
   wa can take the form way or way ma. The latter, way ma, usually has the meaning
‘what’s the matter?’. When it is used with the indefinite demonstrative ure (8.1(G)) in a
concept juxtaposition construction (12.21) it becomes waw to form ure waw ‘what is
this?’. It also combines in a special phrase with the form -mban to form wamban ‘why?’
(cf. ay amban ‘who is it?’) and with the genitive mati (8.2(1)) to form mati wa ‘concerning
what?’, ‘why?’.
   wa forms a progressive using a juxtaposition construction (12.223) where the redundant
pronoun can be either wa or wo.

             INDEPENDENT CONCORD FORMS:
                 SUBSTANTIVES - PART II
This chapter considers in detail the independent concord forms (4.4) enumerated in the
accompanying table (Table 7). The discussion deals first with the seminominal and then
with the nominal forms. The section letters correspond to those in the table.
                                8.1 SEMINOMINALS
  A. (b-) The forms prefixed with the consonant b- are ultimately derived from the noun
bin ‘general area’ (e.g. ‘around here’). The form b> has a special alternate ba:b- that
obligatorily takes one of the demonstrative suffixes (6.11). A free variant    of bazb is
bob(-), and when the form takes the demonstrative vowel -u the alternate bub- is possible:
bubu. The stressed emphatic pronoun (7.23) can take bo in lieu of a demonstrative
suffix. bey and bobey both have the same meaning, ‘where?’; their distribution, however,
is different. bobey can only appear in concept juxtaposition constructions (4.72). ban is
not to be confused with the neutral theme -ban ‘finish’ and the connective ban ‘and then’.
banoban   has the sense of ‘everywhere’, ‘each place’, ‘nowhere’, etc. bati and bumbs (etc.)
have a special meaning referring to place of residence.
      ply> nalako bo          ‘he stayed there a long time’
      ulapum bazba   di falaf ‘return from there by the river’
      banalakom                 ‘(the place) where he stayed’
      bey nuje                  ‘where did you go?’
      alasan bobey              ‘where is Alasanne’s place?’
      ube nimane                ‘I like this place’
      najaw be buke             ‘he went someplace (to a certain place)’
      banoban nuje              ‘wherever you go’
      bati yisuf atis          ‘at Yisuf’s brother’s home’
      bumbe suma:nsum          ‘home pleases me’
  B. (t-) Forms prefixed with t- are based on the noun tin ‘a restricted circumscribed area’
(eg. a table top). It parallels the forms based on bin except that t- is never used with the
disjunctive possessive nor the genitive. The demonstrative         alternate of to is ta:t- ~ tot-.
      piy> nalak> to                      ‘he sat there a long time’
      ta:te nilakoe kabirin na:nana       ‘here I sit since always’

      tey nom                             ‘where are you (sg)?”

      ninenes tanotan bare ijukut yo ‘I looked everywhere but I didn’t find it’
      tike tanumanjum                     ‘a certain place that you (sg) know’
  c. (d- ~r-) The forms prefixed with d- ~ r- are based on the noun din~rin ‘a place
within’. All expressions of this morpheme, with the exception of the basic noun and the
relative object relational, are tense,} thus allowing for its differentiation from the d- ~ r-

  D. The n- series which has no nominal base? refers to time; thus n> ‘at that time’, nan,
or nen ‘at the time when’ (napi ‘when in the future’ (10.311)), ney and noney (the latter
in concept juxtaposition constructions) ‘when?’, nike ‘at a certain time, sometimes’,
nanonan (naznana, etc.), ‘always, never’, nakon ‘at one time, once upon a time’. nakon
can be used interchangeably with funak fakon ‘one day’, and both are occasionally used at
the beginningof a folktale. nike can be made into a distributive: nikenike ‘from time totime’.

     nakon emunguney dela:k> ejaw ‘one time the hyena was going’
  E. The series p-, with the vowel a, refers to the frequency with which an act, or
consecutive acts is performed. The concord cardinals and ordinals (7.36) prefix pa-
directly, while the nominal cardinal numbers (9.11) require the quantity indicator (7.43).
All number series (9.11) use one of the ordinal verb phrases. pakon can have the sense of
‘together’. Two other forms are nalamu:zka ‘the last time’ (7.363) and pamene ‘several
times’ (-men ‘be full’).

   Bound person markers and bound concord pronouns are grouped as second position
suffixes. All suffixes that precede person markers and concord pronouns are first position
suffixes, and all those that follow are third position suffixes. In one case, part of a first
position suffix may optionally follow a person marker (cf. £ below). The passive mode
and the noun emphasis markers are mutually exclusive with person markers and concord
pronouns and thus could be thought of as second position suffixes. For functional reasons,
however, I have placed the passive with the first position suffixes (where one finds the
negative and habitual modes), and the noun emphasis with the third position suffixes
(a position occupied by the simple subordinate and verb emphasis markers).
   When two person markers come together, the second position sub-divides, with the
indirect object preceding the direct.
   The third position includes all of the emphasis/subordination markers except the past
subordinate. The contingent and the mi variant of the simple subordinate are ‘loosely’
tied to the verb. They may be separated from it by partial juncture and need not respond
to vowel harmony. Because no other form can be placed between them and a bound
complement, they cannot be thought of as postclitics. The reduplicated verb and the
noun emphasis markers always respond to vowel harmony.

  The following forms are grouped as first position suffixes: the discontinuous ‘towards
the speaker’ derivative -ul>~-ul~-u, the past absolute -e:n, the remote past -e:n...-€:n,
the negative markers -ut and ->rut, the habitual -e, the passive -i and the suffixed sections
of the past subordinate -er, and the 1st person plural inclusive -a~~al.
   Tentatively, the rules for their combination are:
   A. The passive marker (-i) appears, without exception, after all other first position
 markers.
  B. The combination of -e + -ut and -ul> + -drut produces -erit and -ruls:t respec-
 tively. These latter two forms act as single units.

   D. The absolute past marker (-e:n) may appear either before or after: -erit, -ul> (but

-a ~-al.
   g. The second member (-€:n) of the remote   past (-e:n . . . -€:n) may be placed any-
where with respect to the markers included in c. above, except directly after the habitual

  Fr. The past subordinate suffix (-er) follows the past absolute and the remote past
markers and precedes the passive and the ‘towards speaker’ marker  (-y ~ -u! variants).
It is mutually exclusive with all other first position suffixes.

    12.114 Single complements — Infinitives: When an infinitive, or an infinitive phrase,
 is placed as a post-verb complement, a construction functionally similar to a two-verb
 string  is formed (12.12). A construction of this type permits the use of auxiliary verbs. In
 such cases the infinitive is always the main verb (cf. 12.121 for extensive listing of
 auxiliaries).
        nimamman furi                ‘I want to eat’
      nan>:len ekan do               ‘he is able to do it’
    12.115 A simple sentence can take a large variety of different complement combina-
 tions. In the following paragraphs some of the more typical ones are described.
    A. Two noun phrases (including bound person markers (10.21)) can be related to each
 other as direct and indirect object. Since the position varies according to the placement
 of emphasis one has to rely on the meaning of the words to determine which object is
 which. Thus, according to where the emphasis is placed, the sentence ‘I gave the food to
 the goat’ can be translated  in Fogny as:
       ejamency furlaf nisene
      furiaf ejameney nisene
      ejameney nisene furiaf
      furiaf nisene ejamency
      nisene furlaf ejameney
      nisene sjameney furiaf
 If there is a possibility of ambiguity, an informant will always place the direct object
 next to the verb when both objects appear on the same side.
       nisene akambanaw ajana        ,                     —
       ajana akambanaw nisene } ey                   ee
 If the objects straddle the verb one has to rely on the general context to differentiate one
 from the other. The sentence
       akambanaw nisene ajanaw
 can be glossed: ‘I gave the Boy to the girl’ or ‘I gave the girl to the Boy’.
                                              Io!
                           MORPHOLOGY               AND   SYNTAX  When an independent pronoun based on m- ‘because of this, this that is referred to’
(8.2(1)) appears, three objects can come into play.
     aw inje m2 njsenumj mi bekorab         ‘because of this I gave you the money’
     babaj bukanak kariem pontiter nin kujolazk mankuriem ema:n> ‘there are people
            who eat potatoes the way the Diola eat rice’
  This particularly complex example breaks down as:
     verb: babaj ‘(there) are (impersonal)’
     direct object: bukanak kariem pontiter ‘the people who eat potatoes’
     indirect object introduced by a preposition: nin kujola:k ‘as the Diola’
     m- object as a relative object phrase which refers back to the direct object rather
            than to an antecedent sentence: mankuriem ema:no ‘like this they eat rice’
  The entire sentence could be reduced to the simple form:
     mo baje bukanak nin kujola:k ‘like this there are people such as the Diola’
  B. Comparative constructions: The basic comparative construction is: subject (object
being compared) -+- -fan ‘be more’-+ complement (quality of comparison, usually an
infinitive) + complement (object against which the subject is being compared). The
relationship between the two complement objects is essentially that of direct to indirect
object. If the objects of comparison are A and B, and the quality of comparison is X,
then a literal gloss would be: A is more X (than) B.
      akila afane fuke:f ampa> _—_ ‘he is smarter than his father’
                                    (he he-more-NE head-the father-his)
       mariyama afane ejak ati> = ‘Mariama is prettier than her sister’
When the two objects are being compared from the point of view of an actor, the actor is
indicated by a bound person marker suffixed to -fan: A is more-me X (than) B.
      katinon efana:m kasum binona ‘I like Katinong more than I like Bignona’
                                 (K. it-is-more-me-SS pleasant B.)
  c. Combined time and place locatives: A sentence can be marked simultaneously for
time and place. There does not seem to be any restriction on where these markers are
placed, though place markers usually stand closer to the verb when they are both placed
on the same side. Time markers never appear between the subject and the verb.
     ta:te nilakoe kabirin na:nana    ‘I have always been sitting HERE’ (chanted while
           playing ‘king of the castle’).(here I-sit-NE since always)
  An alternate version of this would be:
     kabirin na: nana nilakoe ta:te ‘I have ALWayYs been sitting here’
     jat akila ale ta:te            ‘topaY he isn’t here’
    pambijaw ba:ba bulay        ‘I shall go there next year’
    fuken ta:te nalakoe         “YESTERDAY he was HERE’
 D. Phrases introduced by the seminominal be (9.22) follow all other complements
that appear on the same side of the verb.

  The initial verb in a string can be marked for tense, mode and syntax. Subsequent
verbs are never marked for tense and can optionally only take simple subordinate and the
mode markers. Except for the last member of a string, if one verb is marked for simple
subordinate the others must be also.
   12.121 Auxiliary verbs: Verb strings functioning in auxiliary constructions are made
up of two verbs, both with the same subject. Complements usually follow the main verb.
In all cases but two the auxiliary is regularly  the head verb. A number of auxiliaryverbs
normally enter only into verb-infinitive complement constructions (12.114).                |
  A. -ban      ‘finish’, functions as a completive marker. baregerul iban ‘having finished
              speaking to you’

              pankuyaben kuban samunasu ‘they will finished lighting the fire’
  B. -jaw     ‘go’, -jol ‘come’ (and other derivatives of -jaw) function as purposives.
              (-jaw frequently combines with be (9.22) to form a proximate future)
              uja uwaloa di ekolon      ‘we (incl) shall go and enter a well’

              najalejaw osjl ‘she has come to cook’
 c. -lak>     ‘stay, sit’ functions as a progressive.
              nalak> ajaw ‘he was in the process of going’
 D. -r2) = ‘live, give birth to’ functions as -lako.
           kutebaku kuroy kulel ‘the carriers were looking for firewood’
 E. -lap    = ‘return, become’ and -lalanken ‘repeat, do repeatedly’ indicate repetition.
              (-lalanken can appear before or after the main verb)
              lan ureg r> ‘say it again’
             nalalan akan d> ‘he did it again’
             nirereg ilalanken ‘I said it and said it again’
  F. -lanken functions as a durative.
             nalanken aket ‘he was continuously dead’
  G. -men    ‘be full’ indicates a durative or intensity. This auxiliary is used ordinarily
             only in infinitive complement constructions (12.114).
             panimen burok ‘I will have continuous work’
             bamen burok iban ‘having finished working continuously’
  H. -f>:len ‘be able’ functions as a potential.

              nan>:len ajaw     ‘he is able to go’

      panusenil ejamen yajake bala ufok ‘you will give them a fine goat before you bury’

 This connector permits, within a verb string, the expression of tense contrast.

             France (speaker in F.)’
Compare:
      nije:neznjaw dakar jlanul firans ‘I had gone to Dakar and (then) returned to
             France (speaker in F.)’
   c. yok has the meaning of ‘until’ (compare the theme -y>k ‘be the limit’).
      panilak> yok alenu         ‘T’'ll stay till he returns’
      nijajaw yok irin binana    ‘I went until I got to Bignona’
   D. kiti has the meaning ‘then, and then’. It serves equally well as a non-concord
modifier (11.).
      nijajaw ply kiti irin      ‘I went a long time, then I arrived’
      aw kiti mo                 ‘you, at it again!’ 12.13 RELATIVE CLAUSES
    Both subject and object relative constructions, either with or without the regent noun,
have the same distribution as other noun phrases (4.3). It is the relative phrases, especially
the object relatives, that turn basically simple sentences into complex structures. This is
particularly true when two relative phrases appear in a single sentence.
   A relative phrase consists of a single finite verb, or a verb string, plus optional comple-
ment(s) and adverb. The initial verb can mark for tense and mode. The only permissible
syntactic markers are the simple subordinate and noun emphasis. From available evidence,
subsequent verbs do not take mood markers.
  When used in neutral theme adjective constructions (7.37) the subject relative construc-
tion can optionally take a definite article.
   If two relative phrases appear in the same sentence they tend to be independent mem-
bers of the same noun phrase. There is no reason, however, why one relative phrase
could not be ‘built’ into another, either as a complement or as a subject.

                               MORPHOLOGY            AND   SYNTAX         delampeney tankuwokum kunomor mah ‘they walk around like this where they
               dug at the hut’
               The relative phrase functions here as a place locative: at-hut-the where-they-
               dig-SS they-go-around like-this; mah is an adverb which is always accompanied
               with a gesture. The relationship of delamaney ‘at the hut’ and tankuwokum
               ‘where they dug’ presents a problem. From one point of view they can be
               thought ofas making up a single locative phrase. By reversing their position
               and reducing tankuwokum to ta:te ‘here’ we have a simple locative phrase:
               ta:te delampaney ‘here at the hut’ (cf. locative phrases 9.21). Another similar
               interpretation would have the two join into a ‘reduced’ genitive phrase (9.12):
               delampaney: (yeti) tankuwokum, which is similar to delampaney yeti ta:te.
               Otherwise they could be thought of as separate complements, one the imme-
              diate constituent of the other.

Two or more noun phrases, or two or more seminominals or seminominal phrases, can
be placed in series with the connective di optionally separating each member off from the
others. A noun or a pronoun, plus di, plus an infinitive placed as a verb complement,
forms a progressive.

     toke yo di furi ‘(this) found him eating’ (note impersonal (4.51))          9.4 NOUN PHRASE AND SEMINOMINAL PREPOSITIONS
A number of relational forms are used as prepositions to introduce noun phrases and
seminominals, Although such constructions do not appear in genitive phrases (9.12),
they otherwise have the same distribution as seminominals and seminominal phrases.
Most of the relational forms also serve as verb string and compound connectives (12.123,
12.151).
  A. The general connective di is frequently used as a preposition, It indicates proximity
and can be glossed, depending on the context, as ‘on’, ‘in’, ‘with’, etc.
      anilaw smb ba:ba di fankaf            ‘the child is there in the courtyard’
      nen jiliba:j di tabuley               ‘put the knife on the table’
      di kalibisak nijuko                   ‘I saw him in the room’
  B. The connective nen ~ nin has the sense of ‘as’ or ‘like’.
     narem nin alulumew                       ‘he is like the European’ (he-stops-SS as E.-
                                              the)
     manomabom nen iper                    ‘that is why we are here as now’
     kakemunek kumanji nin kawa>         = ‘his foot is as well known as his face’
   c. The forms kabirin~birin~bupor~kabupor have the sense of ‘since’ and are used
to introduce time locatives or some noun phrase defining past time.","[60, 61]"
"9.11 HicHer Numpers AND NuMBER PHRASES
   g.111 Higher Cardinals: To the four concord numerals (7.361) are added four numerals
based on multiples of five. Each is formed with a neutral theme and is a noun in its own
right. They never show concord with the noun they modify, and if they are used as a
noun substitute they usually  take the quantity indicator (9.113).

Two decimal numbers have been borrowed(?) from Manding. Although they do not have
noun clase markers they are assigned to either class 3 (€) or 4 (si-).
      ceme          ‘hundred’ (Mdg. keme, WIf. temer)
      wilj          ‘thousand’ (Mdg. wull)
   All other numbers are indicated as the sum or as the multiple of basic forms. Sums are
arranged in order of descending quantity and are separated from each other by the general
connective di. The concord numerals continue to maintain accord with their regent when
they are used in sums. If the form -okon ‘one’  is used in such series it takes the singular
class alternateof its regent.
     sijamen futok di sigaba                 ‘seven goats’
      uba:r kabanan di bekon                 ‘twenty-one trees’
      kusek kabanan di butinken di kuba:kir ‘thirty-nine women’
  Multiples consist of two numbers: a multiplicand followed by a multiplier. The two
numbers are placed one after the other and are NoT separated by a connective. Only the
form kabanan ‘twenty’ and the two borrowed forms ceme ‘hundred’ and wilj ‘thousand’
can serve as multiplicands. When so employed kabanan becomes bukan ‘people’. The
concord forms -gaba ‘two’, -fe:gir ‘three’, and -ba:kir ‘four’ serve as multipliers. These
latter accord with the multiplicand by taking class 2 with bukan and class 4 with ceme
and wilj. A neutral theme numeral or a numeral sum may be used as a multiplier. In

In order to separate a numeral from a multiplier sum the regent must be restated. If the
number is abstract, the quantity indicator is used instead (9.113).

      ceme futok di soni sigaba                   ‘five hundred and two’
If the regent has a different class marker than the multiplicand, the separation can be
indicated by the concord pattern.
      kusekak ceme futok di sigaba      ‘seven hundred women’
      kusekak ceme futok di kugaba      ‘five hundred and two women’
The regent must be restated, regardless of class, if a neutral theme is to be separated
from a multiplier sum.
     uba: raw wilj kabanan di uba:raw unen diugaba       ‘twenty thousand and twelve trees’
  Multiples can be combined into sums and, following the rule of descending quantity,
multiples precede single numbers and higher multiples precede lower multiples.
      sijamen bukan kugaba dupen di sife:gir ‘fifty-four goats’
      uba:r ceme futok di siba:kir di bukan kugaba di upen di bakon ‘nine hundred and

  9.112 Higher Ordinals: Ordinals higher than -foken ‘fifth’ (7.362) are formed by using
cardinal numbers in one of two types of subordinate verb sentences introduced by a
relative subject pronoun. One of these sentences shows a feature unique to Fogny
(though common in other Diola dialects): a definite article that is in concord with the
regent noun is suffixed to the last number. Since the ordinal sentence begins with a relative
subject concord the entire phrase can be thought of as something like an extended noun
with a definite article suffix.
   In both sentence types, if the regent noun is plural, then -akon ‘one’ takes the singular
class alternate of the noun and, contrariwise, if the regent is singular the other concord
numerals take the appropriate plural alternate.
   Sentence type I:
      sjlu:pas sakanum futok di yakon       ‘the sixth (group of) houses’ (houses-the that-
                                            make-SS five and one)

single concord forms, may optionally be introduced with the quantity indicator -oni or
-on>. When the consecutive markers pa- and ma- (8.1 (E-F)) are used with a nominal
numeral the use of -2ni is obligatory. It is usually used to introduce extended number
series or numbers made up entirely of nominal numerals. ->ni is never used with an
 ndependent -akon ‘one’.

  The genitive particle can introduce any type of noun or seminominal phrase. In certain
rapid and emphatic constructions the particle is simply dropped, or is dropped with the
position of the regent and genitive nouns being reversed. The independent concord
genitive mati (8. (1)) can introduce a finite verb sentence.
     nibebet funakaf fati ejay kasa         ‘I determined the day for going to the Casa’
     ebaj to fere yeti betey               ‘he (hyena) had there a means of running away’

     kafokak watay ‘the time of the burial’ (cf. watay yeti kafokak)
9.13 PossEssIvE PHRASES
  9.131 A noun marked with a bound person marker (7.132) can be extended into a
possessive phrase consisting of two (or more) nouns linked together as possessor and
possessed. The possessed noun, which acts as a regent, follows the possessor and is
linked to it by way of the person marker.
  Although functionally equivalent to the disjunctive possessive adjective (7.35) and the
genitive relational (9.12), possessive phrases are limited in that the possessor is usually a
personal noun.
  When a possessive phrase is used to designate kinship links, several possessed nouns
can be strung out together.
     asekaw esuko elujluj § ‘the woman’s village is far’
     yisuf ampa> ati apola = ‘Yisuf’s father’s brother’s son’  9.132 ‘Self Phrases’: Fogny has a number of frequently employed phrases used to
designate uniqueness. Their structure is roughly equivalent to that of possessive phrases.
They consist of a noun phrase (which may be a noun substitute or seminominal) plus a
theme suffixed with a bound person or subject/object marker referring back to the noun or
seminominal phrase. When used as a finite verb subject the noun phrase acts as the
regent, and when used as a verb complement, the noun phrase may be reduced to a
relative object pronoun (7.412) or to a bound object (4.52).","[58, 59, 60]"
"                           10.1 CONCORD INFLECTION
Markers referring back to the regent noun are prefixed directly to the verb theme. They
can be either subject noun class or personal markers, or relative pronouns (cf. 7.41 for a
discussion of the latter).                                  |10.11 Noun Crass MARKERS
   The entire concord marker is prefixed directly onto the verb theme. As with adjectives
(7.3), markers of the form Ca prefix as Cu. Verbs in concord with class 1 nouns prefix
the 3rd person singular form (10.12). In rapid speech when the regent noun or its substi-
tute directly precedes the verb, class markers of the form V can optionally be dropped.
     emunguno ¢ejum bo          ‘hyena stopped there’

  The bound personal pronouns are:
     ni-~i-                     ist person singular
     nu-~u-                     2nd person singular

     ku-                        3rd person plural (equivalent to class 2)
Except when the dual-plural distinction is made (7.132), the alternation of the suffixed
part of the first person plural inclusive (-a~~al) is morphophonemically determined (3.7).
The alternation of the two allomorphs of the singular and 1st person plural prefixesis
morphologically determined. The two sets are both in complementary distribution and
in contrast.
  Complementary distribution: The full form (i.e., ni-, na-, etc.) is used with the initial
verb of a simple sentence and with the initial verb of both sections of a compound
sentence when the verb is neither contingent (4.533 (4)) mor negative (4.532(A)), and
when it does not take a second position prefix (10.4) or the verbal preclitic connectives

man and ban (12.123, 12.152). In all other situations the stripped form (i.e. I-, a- etc.)
is used.                                                                        }
   Contrast: The stripped form may substitute for the full form. Depending on the
context this transformation indicates an imperative (4.57), an interrogative (4.74), or the
the fact that emphasis is placed on the subject (4.533(4)).
       utiger fugolaf            ‘you broke the stick’ or ‘did you break the stick?’ or

       nutiger fugolaf            ‘you broke the stick’ (narrative construction (4.54)).
   When the contingent marker (ja) appears in parallel compound construction (12.151
(a)) the full form is used:
       nubaj> ja nujol            ‘if you have time, then come’                             |
The full form, when used in this situation and when used to mark the second section of a
compound sentence, becomes.the functional equivalent of di-+ marker. Thus in the
above example if the 3rd person plural should substitute for the 2nd person singular we
would have:
       di kubaj> ja di kujol      ‘if they have time then let them come’
  When taking the 1st person plural inclusive, the defective verb -en> ‘exist’ (4.581(B))
infixes the suffix -al between en and 9:
     wala nonaloe                 ‘we (incl) are’ (nu .. . al -+ end + &)10.13 PLURAL CONCORD WITH SINGULAR REGENTS
  When a bound verb subject referent is the plural alternate of its singular regent, a
second noun is implied as interacting with the regent. The understood noun can option-
ally be placed as a verb object complement introduced by the connective di (9.4(D)).
     emunguney silak> ejaw        ‘the hyena (and some friends) were going’

10.21 PERSONAL      MARKERS
  With the addition of two allomorphs, the personal markers used as bound complements
are identical with bound possessives (7.132).

     el: ~ -il                    them
When the 1st person singular appears before the simple subordinate marker -m ~ mi or
a reduplicate theme (verb emphasis) it takes the alternate: -a:m. If the theme begins
with a vowel and the 1st person singular marker directly precedes this vowel, the form
of the marker is -an.

   10.311 The future and the future in the past (F and FP) are marked by pan-~ pi
when positive and le-~ let- when negative. pan-, le- and let- are second position prefixes,
whereas    pi is a preclitic.
   The common distribution of the positive alternates is: pi obligatory        for relative
clauses;    pan- elsewhere.
   When pi joins with the relative object Can- it forms the preclitic Capi or Campi, and
when it joins with the relative subject Ca- it forms the prefix Capi-. Since     the object
relative variant Capi is identical with the subject relative, the context (semantic     and
formal) must be relied upon to differentiate the two.

   The distribution of le- and let- is morphophonemically determined (3.7). Relative clauses
cannot take this morpheme. This is due to the alternate role of le- and let- as non-concord
-modifiers (11.A). Thus the following phrases are structurally the juxtaposition of two nouns
phrases (4.721):
      sijamenas le sankubuj mi            ‘the goats are not the ones they killed’
      sijamenas le sapikubuj mi           ‘the goats are not the ones they will kill’
      anilaw let apos mi                  ‘the child is not the one who washes’
 A construction identical to those used for the indirect future subject relative must be used
in order to express future negative:
      sijamenas sankujerit mi bebuj ‘the goats which they will not kill’ (i.e. ‘the goats
                                          which they never go to kill’)
      anilaw ajerit mi bepos              ‘the child who will not wash’ (i.e. ‘the child who
                                          never goes to wash’)
  10.312 The past absolute (PA) is always marked with the first position suffix -e:n.
     nibaje:nebaj                   ‘I used to always have
  10.313 The remote past (RP) is invariably marked by a repetition of the past absolute
marker: -€:n . . . -€:n. The two morphemes may be separated by other suffixes.
     nibone:nule: nobon            ‘I had sent him from’
   10.314 The past hypothetical (PH) is formed by combining one of the future markers
(pan-, pi, le-, let-) with the absolute past (-e:n).

habitual (10.322) to form -erit!. In imperative constructions the negative is marked with1In the speech of some Sindian speakers -erit becomes -erit when it is used with any one of

mark the negative (10.311). The special negative meaning ‘not yet’ is marked with the
suffix -orut.

     erinorut                          ‘he hasn’t yet arrived’
  The defective verb -em ‘be’ usually indicates the negative by way of the form -le ~-let
prefixed with an appropriate bound subject. This negative construction can only take
concord and tense markers.

  The future negative of -em can be either let-em or pan-let. The same holds for the past
hypothetical.

                             fukenum                     ‘two days ago’
                             fuken                       ‘yesterday’
     jat     ‘today’
                          kajom                   ‘tomorrow’
                          kejomum                 ‘two days hence’
                          kajomum lya             ‘three days hence’
                          kajomum lyapa:m>        ‘four days hence’
  The form fulen ‘month’, which is a true noun and not a seminominal, is expandedby
forming a genitive phrase with either fuken or kajom.
     fulen fati kajom       ‘next month’
     fulen fatifukenum § ‘two month’s ago’
  In order to refer to more remote time the nouns funak ‘day’ and emit ‘year’ must be
used instead. For example:
     babaj simitas soni futok             ‘five years ago’ (there-are years-the there-are five)
     napi simitas soni futok siketum      ‘when five years are over’ (when-F years-the
                                          there-are five they-die-SS)                                      6.2 SUBMORPHEMIC m
The phoneme m appears in a number of morphemes all of which function in some
capacity as relationals. Included are two of the five syntactic verb markers, one of the
independent concords, and one of the general connectives. The fact that the m occupies a
position either initially, finally, or in a final morpheme suggests that each form may have
been derived from a single more general connective or relational.

                       A GRAMMAR       OF DIOLA-FOGNY  Independent concords formed with the concord prefix me- (8.2(1)) are:

      man-          ‘this that has been referred to previously’
      mati          ‘concerning’
  To these forms may be added the derivative marker -ym which insists   on an action-
object or action-actor relationship (5.216).
(N.B. In Kasa Diola min functions as a purposive relational. and mu serves  both as a
contingent and as a simple subordinate marker (Kennedy, n.d.: 17).)

       MORPHOLOGY:                    SUBSTANTIVES                    - PART IThis chapter and the two that follow (8 and 9) parallel sections 4.3-4.4 of the grammatical
sketch; they cover seminominals and all forms, except finite verbs, involved in concord.
The present chapter is devoted to the individual forms; Chapter 8 deals with independent
concord forms (4.4), and Chapter 9 with extended noun phrases. Consideration of
phrases introduced by relative pronouns have been deferred to the chapter on syntax
 12.13-14).
                                       7.1 NOUNS
  7.11 Noun Crass MARKERS
   The noun class markers group into singular-plural pairs, collectives, mass, abstract,
infinitive, seminominal, and adverbial markers. All of these, except the latter three (cf.
7.5, 7-6, and 11(c)), are covered in this section. 7.116 gives examples of extended noun
class alternation. A glance at part £ of this section clearly demonstrates the extensive use,
beyond number and alternation, to which noun class markers may be put.
   The entire group of noun class markers can be fully distinguished only when they are
prefixed to nouns. All other forms taking class concord, viz. pronouns, adjectives,
relationals and finite verbs, prefix class markers of the shape Ca as Cu.
   In all cases, verbs excepted, the vowels of noun class markers are subject to assimilation
before themes beginning      with a vowel (3.21).
   The nineteen noun classes with their respective functions are as follows:
  Noun class
   I a                 singular personal (pairs with 2).
   2 ku-~ buka-      _ plural personal (pairs with 1).

Statistically, classes 1 through 11 and 13 are the most important, and among these, 3 and
4 and, to a lesser extent, 1 and 2 have the largest membership. Classes 16 through 18
have very few members (three to five or six each) and class 19 has only one recorded form.","[41, 42, 43, 44]"

Paperback Re-issueFirst published in 1965, and reprinted in 1969, this monograph by J.David Sapir ts
concerned with the language of the Diola (Dyola, Jola) people living near the
Casamance River in the region of Senegal historically known as the Basse-Casamance.
The study looks specifically at the important dialect Fogny, which can be thought
of asvariants of ‘standard’ Diola. At the time of the monograph’s publication, the
Fogny dialect was used by approximately 85,000 native speakers in the area around
Bignona, Senegal, and was understood by practically all Diola people. This gram-
mar presents a descriptive study of the dialect covering phonology, morphology
and syntax.","[86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92]"
"   7.23 EMPHATIC DEMONSTRATIVE
   The emphatic demonstrative consists of the general pronoun C5, plus the definite
article -aC, plus either a demonstrative suffix (6.11) or an independent seminominal of
the form C> (8). The class 1 form suffixes the definite article as -m (3.242). When used
as a 2nd person plural the joj(€) is optionally used. The emphatic demonstrative appears
only in concept juxtaposition constructions (4.721) and in subject stressed and stative pro-
gressives (12.222,4).

  As with the distributive noun (7.14), the distributive pronoun CanoCan,       and its free
variants CanoCani,    Ca: CaCa and Canosan, express the idea of ‘every’, ‘each’, or ‘none’,
As with the noun, the negative or positive quality of the form is determined by the
predicate verb, The variant Ca:CaCa does not exist for Class 1.

   7.361 The four lowest cardinal numbers always accord with the regent noun. They
 can optionally (though rarely) take a definite article. (Cf. 9.11 for a complete discussion of
 numerical formation.)
       «akon                        ‘one’
       -gaba                        ‘two’
       -fe:gir                      ‘three’
       -bazkir                      ‘four’
Abstract numbers take the class 4 markers except for -akon which takes class 3.
     eyen yakon               ‘one dog’
     kares koakonok           ‘one name (i.e. the same name)’

      sigaba                        ‘two’
   7.362 The five basic ordinals (1st through sth) accord with their regent. They op-
tionally take a definite article. Higher ordinals are formed with cardinals in a special type
of construction (9.112). Ordinals can function as verbs.
      -tonond                       ‘first (cf. -ton “begin’)
      -gabuten               ‘second’?
      -fe:giten              ‘third’
      eba:kinden ~ -ba:kiren ‘fourth’
      -token                        ‘fifth’ (cmp: futok ‘five’)
      eyeney etonondey              ‘the first dog’

      ubs:raw uba: kundenaw ‘the fourth group of trees’
      sinara:s sitokenas    ‘the fifth monkeys’
      ilanut igabuten       ‘je n’ai pas recommencé une deuxiéme fois’ (Weiss, p.419)7 The correspondence between the ordinals and the cardinals suggests that the former were once
produced by a derivative suffix. The forms -ba:kiren and -token suggests that the derivative
suffix was -en, and the form -gabuten suggests an allomorph -ten when preceded by a vowel. An
-tn ~ -ten alteration is argued by Wintz (p.45) for the Carabanne (Kasa(?)) dialect where the
evidence
      is much clearer:
  cardinal        ordinal
      -lluba         -llubuten                ‘two’
      “haji          -hajiten                 ‘three’
      -ba:kir        -ba:kiren                ‘four’
      -tok           “token                   ‘five’
      “pen           “penen                   ‘ten’
      “yl            -yien                    ‘twenty’
  The consonant alternation t-nd- and r in the Fogny ordinals, -fe: giten, ba: kinden, ba: kiren
respectively, imply a system of alternation similar to the one observed for d- nd- r (cf. note 3 above).","[50, 51]"

and absence of the external syntactic markers, viz. contingent and past subordinate               thetical), the emphatic and the negative fall together by combining with the general E/S

the aorist, the past absolute and the remote past; the contingent,        which defines its own   remote past) combines with all three, and the habitual and passive with two.8 The lack of

12.21 SIMPLE JUXTAPOSITION
 A simple juxtaposition consists of two phrases. The first may be any noun phrase
capableof functioning as a finite verb subject and any nominal phrase introduced
                                                                              by a
preposition (9.4). The second phrase may be any noun phrase, seminominal, or any
impersonal verb construction (4.51) that describes a quality.                                                                                         rrechtlich geschutztes Material
                            A GRAMMAR         OF DIOLA-FOGNY The following list covers the more common constructions:
 (NP = subject  noun phrase)
 A.       NP + NP to form an attributive:
         inje ajaburun          ‘I am a stranger’
 B. NP +- impersonal (or adverb? 11(c)) to form an attributive:
    sinanas sunsum          ‘the meal is good’
         ajana jejak             ‘a girl is pretty’
 c. NP+ infinitive or infinitive phrase   to form a vague progressive:
    inje ejaw                ‘I go’ or ‘I am going’
    kusekak uke kasanken ‘these women talk, are talking’
 Dp. NP + di + infinitive to indicate a progressive (cf..similar construction for noun
  ings     (9.3):
         inje di kasanken        ‘I am talking’
 E. NP + be + infinitive to form a proximate future:
    aninew belanu           ‘the man is going to return from’
    umu beburok             ‘that (person) is going to work’
 F. NP + the stressed demonstrative pronoun or a seminominal place locative to assert
existence
        in space:
         anilaw sme              ‘the child is here’
         inje fatiya             ‘I am up high’
  G. NP + interrogative locative pronoun to demand the location of an object:
         jiliba:} jojey           ‘where is the knife?’12.22 CoMPLEX JUXTAPOSITION
   12.221 Place and time locatives can be added to existing juxtapositions. The place
locative is usually a constituent of one of the juxtaposition members; time locatives are
constituents   of the entire phrase.
       sinanas ta:te sunsum                 ‘the food (that) is here is good’
       uli bukoke bo                        ‘we (excl) are there’

      > sinjan kabirin fuken                ‘he has been at Sindian since yesterday’
  12.222 NP + stressed demonstrative -+- (di) +- infinitive (or infinitive phrase) indicates
a progressive that emphasizes the NP.
      injome di kasanken dakila         ‘I am talking with him’
      bukankak kati ba:be bukoke dewan ‘the people from around here are cultivating’
  12.223 An important
                type of complex construction is the following: NP +- finite verb +-
di -+- pronoun referring back to the initial NP.
   This construction    can best be thought of as a two level juxtaposition. The NP and the
finite verb are first juxtaposed against each other and then against the redundant pronoun:
       NP/ finite verb // di + pronoun.

Considered in this section are higher numbers, genitive and possessive phrases and the
grouping of adjectives into single phrases. Higher numbers and genitive phrases are
functionally equivalent to adjectives; they may act either as noun modifiers or as substi-
tutes. Possessive phrases, however, differ in that they must always include the regent, or,
as is possible in a group of special cases (9.132), its substitute.
  Subject and object relative phrases are, like genitive phrases and higher numbers,
equivalent   to adjectives. Since their construction involves finite verbs, etc., I have deferred
their discussion   to the chapter   on syntax (12.13).","[57, 58]"
"12.15 COMPOUND SENTENCES
   A compound sentence consists of two or more simple and/or verb string sentences. They
are linked together by connectives and/or syntactic or tense contrast. A number of the
connectives serve equally well in verb strings (12.123) and as noun phrase prepositions
(9.4).

          where he has mother’s brothers or where you know (i.e. wherever)’  12.152 Tense and contingency:
  A. Two sentences can be drawn together to indicate tense contrasts. The four tense
markers and the past subordinate, with or without the support of connectives, serve to
indicate these relationships.
  The following juxtapositions occur:
      ANTERIOR SENTENCE § POSTERIOR SENTENCE
      aorist                   future, past subordinate +- orut (not yet)
      past absolute            aorist
      remote past              aorist
      past subordinate         aorist, future
If the past subordinate   is marked for tense (either past absolute or remote past) the
posterior phrase takes the same tense markings.
  Examples: (the two sentences are separated by a comma (,) )
     ani kaporak kep kugore , panel> ‘(when) the dust alone touches him, he will fall’
     nipurulopur dakar , aw barokorut di sidi ‘I left Dakar, before you had started

                          A GRAMMAR         OF     DIOLA-FOGNY   B. A conditional relationship is also indicated by sentence juxtaposition. The following
 types occur:
      CONDITION    SENTENCE     RESULTANT    SENTENCE
      aorist                    future
      past absolute             future, past hypothetical,
                                 past subordinate + past absolute
       remote past              future, past hypothetical
       contingency               aorist, future
 The condition sentence is introduced with an adverb indicating hypotheticalness. If the
 general context implies a conditional relationship, the adverb becomes optional. At no
 time does a contingency construction take this modifier. A conditional sentence cannot
 be marked for verb emphasis.
       nen alanuls:t sindey yola , panujuk> ba:be ‘if he hasn’t returned to his home, you
             will see him here’
       tandi nuje:ne kasa , pansum>m ‘if you had gone to the Casa, I should have been
             pleased (it would have pleased me)’
       tandi umane:nut anine , panulake:n sjndey yeti ampayi ‘if you hadn’t wanted a

      umanjut ja, none balandin ‘if you didn’t know, you would have said Balandine’
      uman ja, paniseni bakori ‘if you want, I shall give you some money’
   c. In extended discourse describing how something is done, a series of contingent acts
are linked by repeated use of the contingent marker. The rough gloss is something like this
‘when (if)... then this... then this . . . etc.’ It is used to link two thoughts, whether or
not these two thoughts are formally related via two separate sentences, via the main verb
and relative clause, or via main verb and complement. The following excerpt from a text
describing customary procedure at a funeral will illustrate its use.
   1. fa    napikujomi           kutebja      kurigul>

A: now when-F-they-come-SS they-carry-C. Sentence B: they-arrive-from.
  2 consists of the first section of a verb string with the first ‘thought’ being: you-kill-
C it, and the second: mah ‘like this’. mah, an adverb always accompanied by a gesture, can
be thought of as marking a shift from talk to gesture.","[74, 75, 76]"
"                     5.3 MULTIPLE DERIVATIVE MARKERS
A derivative suffix can be added as an immediate constituent to a secondary theme in
order to produce a multiple derivative, or what Wintz (p.45) calls a ‘dérivé secondaire’.
There are two common types: theme+ verbal derivative+- nominal derivative to form
a noun; theme ++ two (and occasionally more) verbal derivatives to form a verb. In the
former pattern the verbal derivative is almost always the reciprocal -or and occasionally
the reflexive ->:
     atekora     ‘boxer’   (-tek     ‘hit’)
     elako:ma ‘seat’        (e+ lak + 2-+ ume)
The only unproductive marker to be used in the multiple verbal derivative is the re-
duplicated iterative (5.222). The meaning is almost always predictable as the sum of the
constituents. Thus -j>j ‘gather, assemble sth’ (-jojen ‘cause to gather’, -j>j> ‘gather self’)
gives -jojoren ‘cause to gather each other’; -kumor ‘hum, grumble, whisper’ gives kun-
kumen ‘stifle a cry’ and -kunkumend ‘stifle one’s own cries’, etc.
  A multiple derivative, formed by the ‘towards speaker’ and the directive, occurs with the
theme -jaw ‘go’. This form, combined with a place locative, glosses as ‘come from’, dakar
najomul> ‘he has come from D.’ (3.51). The directive disengages the subject from the
locative, something not possible if the ‘towards speaker’ derivative appears alone, dakar
nijal> ‘I have come to D. (speaker at D.)’. If an object substitutes for the locative, the
subject and object have the same locality.

                                THEME FORMATION
In four recorded instances a verb inflectional marker appeared functioning as a derivative
former: the passive suffix -i combines with -wol ‘give birth’ to form kawoli ‘birth (n)’;
the past subordinate (4.533) with -kan ‘make’ to form bakaner ‘finished product’ and the
negative -ut (4.532) to form sumut ‘be sick’. The negative -ut also joins with the theme
-ju ‘be in good health’ to form -ju:t ‘be sick’. This secondary form, however, cannot be
reduplicated even though the status of -ut as a derivative is assured by its position.
Consider the double derivative formation: -ju:talenor ‘pretend to be sick’ in the phrase
aju:talenorerit ‘he never pretends to be sick’, a phrase which would be impossible if -ut
was functioning in its normal capacity as mood marker.","[38, 39]"
"  10.323 The passive (pas) is marked by the suffix -i.
      nibonelbop                    ‘I am habitually sent’
      waf warieriti                 ‘something uneatable’   10.324 The emphatic (emph) is marked with the prefix mbi- ~ bi- or, in its full form,
the preclitic mambi. This latter is actually a combination of the verb connective man
(12.123(A)) and bi. The shorter forms combine with the future marker pan- and the
negative imperative marker takun- to form pambi- and takumbi- respectively, and with
the object relative preclitic Can- to form Cambi. The alternate bi is never used with the
Ist person singular,

  10.331 Verb emphasis (VE) is indicated by verb theme reduplication.
      nimamanj              ‘I know’
      kububurenslabuburen   ‘they ground us (incl) into the sand’                                             94
                            MORPHOLOGY            AND     SYNTAXThere are two irregularities: 1. In the speech of Sindian speakers the themes -jaw ‘go’,
jal> ‘go towards’ (-jaw--ul>), and -jak “be good’ optionally reduplicate as -jejaw, -jalejaw,
and -jejak respectively instead of the expected -jajaw, -jalojaw and -jajak. (The expected
forms   are always used by Bignona speakers.) The shift    of a>€ must not be misconstrued
as indicating the presence of the habitual.
   2. Four of the verbs that begin with ¢ (or €:) and that have special prefix assimilation
(3.221) indicate verb emphasis by reduplicating the entire form, including the concord
 prefix. The initial C of the reduplicated section becomes s*. The basic pattern is expressed
with -€:t ‘ought, go home’.
     nesse:t        ‘I ought’ (<ni+e:t+-ni+€:t)
     Na:sa:t        ‘he ought’
     Co:so:t        ‘you (sg), it, etc. ought’
     No:taso:t      ‘we (incl) ought’ (<nu. . . a+et-+-nu-+et)
Bignona speakers allow certain variations in the remaining three forms: -en> ‘be like’,
-en ‘say’,
         and -eken ‘have in hand’. In these cases the initial vowel of the reduplicated
form may vary according to the pattern:
     Initial vowel of                       Initial vowel of
     the entire form                        reduplicated form
             €                                     €
             a                                     €,a
            -)                                     €, 2, > (only ¢, > for -eken)
     nenisen                                   ‘I told you’
     nanisen~nanisan                           ‘he told you’
     nonisen~nonisan~nonison                   ‘we (excl) told you’
The reduplicated   section of -eken may be sen (etc.) or Ceken (etc.) instead of the expected
seken (etc.).
      nekenneken~nekenseken~nekensen             ‘I have in hand’
      kokenkoken~kokenseken~kokensen             ‘they have in hand’

   6.1 PLACE DEMONSTRATIVE AND TIME LOCATIVE                                 FORMATION
  6.11 Pace DEMONSTRATIVES
  Fogny has a five-place set of demonstrative suffixes, the first three of which are formed
by vowel alternation while the last two are formed by morpheme addition.
     “€             ‘here’
     ou             ‘there’ (indefinite as to locality, emphasizes existence)
     “a             ‘there’ (definite locality)
     “ana:          ‘over there’
     ‘ana:m>      § ‘away over there’
One of these forms is obligatorily suffixed to the demonstrative pronoun (7.31) and the
seminominal forms ta:t- (circumscribed area), ba:b- (general area), and dor- (within)
(8.1(a-c)). The emphatic demonstrative may suffix either one of these demonstratives
(7.23), or one of the seminominal place locatives of the form Co. The definite article
(4.312, 7.131) may optionally suffix -u, -a, or -€. It only rarely takes the suffix -e or -a. The
special suffix -am, which can be used with the defective verb -em (4.581(a)), can take any
one of the five suffixes.
     ejameney yoye        |           ‘the goat is here’
     uli bazbe                        ‘we (excl) here’
     muyu bazba                       ‘you (pl) there’
     kubura:k uka                     ‘those ducks’
     anilau umu                       ‘that child’
     kusekaku                         ‘the woman’
     bajulom mumelam tat:ana:         ‘get me some water from over there’
     ba: bana: mo firans              ‘away over there in France’
     inje emame                       ‘I am here’  6.12 Tre     LocatTives
   Four of the seminominal time locatives optionally take a three-place set of additive
suffixes indicating time steps. The first morpheme is bound to the theme; the other two
are separated by word juncture.
     -um                 ‘plus one’
     -um iya             ‘plus two’
     -um lyanaz:m>       ‘plus three’ (note correspondence to the place demonstrative
                         -anazm>)
                                               58

      sunken        ‘last year’
      bulay         ‘next year’
      fuken         ‘yesterday’
      kajom         ‘tomorrow’
bulay must suffix -en before it can take -um (cf. accompanying chart for a full expansion
of these time locatives).","[40, 41]"
"                                            IIo
                              MORPHOLOGY         AND    SYNTAX  3 consists of the second section of the verb string introduced  by the connective man
plus another verb string. (‘The over-all structure of 2. and 3. must be considered as a
compound consisting of two verb strings.)
  In 4 ja links a relative time locative to the main verb string.
  (Translation: ‘When they arrived from carrying (the corpse) you will kill it (a cow?)
so that you (can) give them (meat) which they go and roast. When the corpse       is put
down, after they have finished eating, you will take a cloth and cover (it).)
  p. The verb connector man (12.123(A)) can be used as a conjunction with the glosses
‘before, as soon as, already’ to mark tense contrast. The verb introduced by man is
marked for noun emphasis and is optionally followed by the completive auxiliary -ban
(12.121(A)). When the verb is marked for the remote past, noun emphasis becomes
optional, and when it is marked for the past absolute, the completive is obligatory.
  The following contrasts were observed:
      POSTERIOR    SENTENCE     ANTERIOR    SENTENCE      future
      contingent        man    + aorist + (-ban)
      aorist      past absolute      man    + {
                                      past absolute -+- -ban
                                              pent + (chen)(N.B. The order, posterior-anterior, must be maintained.)
     panajaw, man bakari acame aban ‘he will     go after Bakari has finished paying’
     nijalojaw, manikate burok ‘I came as soon as I finished work’
     ujukom ja, manipure iban ‘when you see me, I shall have already left’
     nuje:njaw dakar, manipure:nulo iban ‘you went to Dakar after I had left’ (-ul>+-
            “€ > -uld)
     nuje:njaw dakar, manipure:ne:nulo ‘you went to Dakar after I had left’
The posterior clause may be a time locative introduced by the independent seminominal
n- (8.(D)).
      n> moanipure iban ‘at the time I had already left’
      napi urok mi di sidi manipure dakar iban ‘when you work for Sidi, I will have
            already left Dakar’
      nanuroke:n mi di sidi manjpure:ne dakar iban         ‘when you had worked for Sidi, I
            had already left Dakar’
Structurally these constructions must be considered as simple sentences with a pre-verb
time locative complement.","[76, 77]"
"             5.5 COMPOUND SECONDARY NEUTRAL THEMES
Very rarely nominal and verbal secondary themes are formed by compounding. The com-
mon pattern is: theme + noun class marker + theme. For example: -jaw ‘go’ plus the
noun class marker bu plus the theme -nar join the form -jabunar as in ajabunar ‘voyager,
stranger’, where bunar, taken separately, glosses as ‘road, path’. Thus the literal gloss:
‘one who goes on the road’.
  In one case the compound is made up of two themes separated by the phoneme /: -n
‘being’ and -fan gives -nifan as in anifan ‘old man, elder’. And in yet another instance the
compound is made up of a genitive particle (4.343) plusa noun class marker + seminominal
(4.37): -atl ‘of’, ka- noun class marker, and -j>m as kajom ‘tomorrow’ give: fatikajom
‘next morning’, or, ‘literally, ‘of tomorrow’.
   Finally, the verb theme -bonket ‘pardon’ is considered by folk-etymology to consist of a
 wo-theme compound: -bom ‘dance’-+ -ket ‘die’ and thus literally ‘dance to death’.
Structurally it seems more likely that the form consists of the primary theme -bonk (no
recorded gloss) plus the verbalizer -et (5.223).",[39]
