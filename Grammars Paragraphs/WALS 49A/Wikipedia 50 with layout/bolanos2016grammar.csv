"11.3 Subject alignment
       Subject arguments of intransitive verbs in Kakua are not treated distinctly
from those of transitive verbs. In other words, both A and S arguments behave in the
same way both morphologically and syntactically, exhibiting a prototypical
nominative-accusative type of morphosyntactic alignment: A=S≠P. Subject
arguments of a clause can be identified in two ways: they are NPs lacking
morphological marking for case (as opposed to other case-marked arguments), on
the one hand, and they trigger morphological agreement on the verb, on the other
hand. Compare the subject of the intransitive verb ʔêg ‘vomit’ in (11) with the subject
of the transitive verb hěmʔ ‘eat’ in (12) below. Note that in both cases the subject
argument is expressed by the pronoun kǎnʔ ‘3SG.F’ and it is indexed on the predicate
with the proclitic mi= ‘3SG.F’; the lack of morphological case marking and the
syntactic position of the subject noun phrase and the indexing on the verb seen in
the intransitive construction in (11) are the same as those in the transitive
construction in (12):11) kǎnʔ        mi=ʔêg=na=ka
    3SG.F        3SG.F=vomit=DECL=ASS
    ‘she is vomiting’12) kǎnʔ          tʃɨ ̌jʔ-daʔ,              niʔat=jǔb,

      3SG.F=eat-PST=REC.PST
      ‘she ate the manioc bread, everything reallyǃ’       As mentioned above, a clause in Kakua can be formed by a subject and a
predicate, or by a predicate with a subject proclitic (in addition to no expression of
subject at all, if recoverable from the context). Consider the following intransitive
clauses. In (13) the subject argument is fully expressed with a free pronoun kǎn
‘3SG.M’ as well as indexed on the verb with the cross-referencing proclitic ã=
‘3SG.M’, which agrees in person, number and gender with the subject NP kǎn.
                                                   Alignment and word order        309Compare this to the construction in (14), where the clause is formed by a single
predicate with the proclitic wã= ‘1SG’, indexing the subject argument of this
intransitive clause:13) kǎn        ʔã=ʔêw=na=ka
    3SG.M       3SG.M=sing=DECL=ASS
    ‘he is singing’14) wã=pĩ-ʔɨm=na=ka
    1SG=HAB-be.afraid=DECL=ASS
    ‘I’m always afraid’        Subject arguments can express the semantic roles of agents or experiencers.
Examples (15) and (16) show subject arguments of stative verbs in which the subject
arguments have the semantic role of ‘patient’, a prototypical semantic role of subjects
of stative verbs:15) wěm         wã=pĩ-hêjʔ-weʔe-kan=be
    1SG          1SG=HABT-know-NEG=REC.PST
    ‘I used to know’16) wěm        bɨ          wã=tʃù-fwɨʔɨ
    1sg         today       1SG=rest-TEL.PROG
    ‘I am, today, still resting’       Subjects of intransitive verbs of motion or active verbs prototypically have
the semantic role of agent. This is illustrated in example (17) below:17) kǎn       ʔã=t-fwɨ ̂b-ʔǎb-beh=na
    3SG.M      3SG.M=EVID-follow-go.up-go=DECL
    ‘he went back up again’       Finally, subjects of intransitive clauses involving verbs of mental or emotional
processes (or verbs of perception) prototypically have the semantic role of
experiencers. Examples (18)-(20) below give an illustration of these types of clauses
in Kakua:18) kǎnʔ        mi=pĩ-tîk=na=ka
    3SG.F        3SG.F=HAB-be.embarrassed=DECL=ASS
    ‘she is usually embarrassed’19) wěm        bɨdǐ           ̃̂

    ‘I was very sad/very sorry’

    night-other 3PL       3PL=EVID-be.surprised=INF.FUT.EVID=ASS
    ‘they might be surprised tomorrow’       Examples (12)-(20) above illustrate the expression of subject arguments in
intransitive clauses, showing that, although the subject noun phrase does not receive
morphological marking to indicate its grammatical function (i.e. no subject case
marker), the verb usually takes a cross-referencing proclitic encoding person and
number properties of the subject argument.
       The expression of subject arguments in transitive clauses is illustrated in
examples (21)-(22), which show that the subject arguments are morphologically and
syntactically expressed in the same way as the subject arguments in the intransitive
clauses presented in (11)-(20) above. In (21) the subject argument expressed by the
NP wã=ʔibi ‘my uncle’ is the instigator of the action expressed by the transitive
verb tɨh ‘kill with blowgun’ performed on an object argument with the semantic role
of patient, which is morphologically marked with the object case marker =diʔ:21) wã=ʔibi  wɨbɨ=diʔ           ʔã=t-tɨh=na=tagǎ
    1SG=uncle bird.sp=OBJ        3SG.M=EVID-kill.with.blowgun=DECL=INF.EVID      tʃãhãp
      PROG
      ‘my uncle must be hunting Curassow (bird.sp)’        Example (22) shows a similar type of clause, where the subject argument is
expressed both by the NP hiw ‘jaguar’, and indexed on the predicate with the
proclitic ‘3SG.M’, agreeing in person, number and gender with the subject argument:22) hiw       mɨhiw=diʔ               ʔã=t-tʃãk=na=wɨt=be
    jaguar dog=OBJ                    3SG.M=EVID-bite=DECL=REP.EVID=REC.PST
    ‘the jaguar bit the dog, it is said’        The syntactic position of subject arguments in intransitive and transitive
clauses is preferably sentence-initial (see above). Additional examples are given in
(23)-(24), displaying constructions involving verbs of perception or mental
processes. In (23) the subject is a lexical noun cross-referenced on the verb by the
proclitic ʔã= ‘3SG.M’. In (24) the subject argument is a pronoun and is also cross-
referenced on the verb:         S      O                           V

    ‘he loved his daughter’        Consider now example (25), in which the subject argument is not expressed
through an NP, but indexed on the predicate of the clause only. In this case the
resulting constituent order is O s=V. Example (26) further illustrates the same order,
where the noun wãp ‘white capuchin’ is the object of the verb fwãʔ ‘find’, and the
subject is expressed by the proclitic fwĩ= ‘1PL’:        O                                   s=V

    ‘we met the (evil spirit) white capuchin’
11.4 Object alignment
       Kakua marks its object arguments with the case marker enclitic =diʔ on the
object NP, i.e. a dependent-marking strategy, in terms of Nichols (1986). Unlike
subject arguments, object arguments are not indexed on the verb. Examples (27)-
(28) below illustrate object case marking:27) měm=be                       wěm=diʔ             ma=buʔé=na=be
    2SG=REC.PST                   1SG= OBJ             2SG=teach=DECL=REC.PST
    ‘you taught me’28) wěm         kǎn=diʔ                   wã=hěp-ʧàʔ-tɨb=na=ka
    1SG          3SG.M= OBJ                 1SG=be.jealous-be.on.top-hurt=DECL=ASS
    ‘I am jealous of him’       The object case marker clitic =diʔ serves to mark object arguments in several
different semantic roles.1 This is examplified in (29)-(32). (See further discussion on
semantic roles and object marking in Chapter 6). Example (29) shows an object
        1
            See the comment in Chapter 6 regarding the possibility that the object marker =diɁ might have
other functions than marking object arguments, as it also occurs on noun phrases expressing source/goal,
as well as on other NPs that are not core arguments.

    3SG.M       3SG.M=daughter= OBJ           3SG.M=care.about
    ‘he loves his daughter’       Kakua treats all object arguments in the same way, including when two or
more objects co-occur in di-transitive constructions, both in terms of the use of the
object case marker =diʔ and the differential object marking that applies to it.
       An example of a ditransitive construction is given in (33) below. This example
exhibits a typical ditransitive Kakua verb wɨʔ̃ ̌ ‘give’, exhibiting an agent-like subject
argument, and two objects, one of which is in a recipient (R) role, Gabí ‘Gabriel’,
and the other, dâwa-daʔ ‘ball-CL:round’ is in a theme (T) role. Two things are
important to note here. Firstly, note that all object arguments are marked with the
object case marker =diʔ. Secondly, note that all arguments occur before the verb:
SOOV.","[329, 330, 331, 332, 333]"
"6.4.2 Comitative and instrumental
        Expressions involving nominals in comitative or instrumental roles are coded
with the clitic =hĩʔ ~ =hiʔ.̃́ The difference between nominals in comitative versus
nominals in instrumental role in Kakua corresponds basically to the distinction of
whether the action is being performed together with a usually animate entity, versus
if the action is being performed using/by means of another entity (usually inanimate).
That is to say, a comitative interpretation of the morpheme clitic =hĩʔ, occurs when
a noun (usually animate) participates in an action together with the subject of the
clause: subject together with comitative performs an action.
        The instrumental interpretation of the noun marked with =hĩʔ occurs when
something is being used by an Agent argument to perform an action: Action
performed with/using instrumental.
        The syntactic structure of clauses involving comitative or instrumental
nominals do not differ one from the other.
     Examples (79)-(80) illustrate cases of noun phrases in the comitative role. Note
that in these examples the object marker =diʔ is not used, showing that its
occurrence on comitative noun phrases is not governed by the same principles as
DOM, according to which they should be marked for being human.

non-prototypical comitative case:81) wɨn-bɨ ̃̂g      pàʔ-at=hiʔ̃́                wɨn      meʔěp=hiʔ̃́      ʔêg=nit

      die
      ‘(they) fall dead, with fever (they) die, (they) vomit with blood and die’         Noun phrases with inanimate referents are prototypical instruments. Examples

    ‘We also worked clothing (sew clothes) with the (sewing) machine’        It is very likely that using the same morpheme to code nouns in comitative
and instrumental roles, responds to an iconic motivation of the close semantic
relatedness between these two concepts. Example (85) below illustrates an instance
that can be interpreted as both instrumental or comitative. It is extracted from a
conversation, where the speaker is telling about his hunting trip, during which he
found an alligator and chopped off the tail of the animal. In a joking manner he tells
his interlocutor that the tip of the alligator (full of leeches) was tasty to eat together
with manioc bread, or by using the manioc bread to push up the leeches on the
alligator’s tail. Both readings where suggested by the speaker who helped with the
translation of this text:85) ʔãjʔ=pĩh              jâp-at=diʔ                 hěmʔ-at=jɨ ̀ʔ=hiʔ̃́

    ‘the tip of his tail was good to eat with manioc bread’
6.4.3 Terminative
        Kakua codes terminative locatives with the preposition pɨ ‘TERM’. This
morpheme is particular in its semantics and its syntax. Semantically, it has a very
narrow meaning, similar to English up until. Terminatives are used to refer to a
specific spatial or temporal location which is situated within a space or time that has
a further continuation. For example, ‘we will walk up until the house’, implying that
there is a path that goes beyond the house, but that our journey will go only up until
where the house is:86) ma=beh-é            pɨ        fwĩ=ʔɨw-at-hɨʔ=na

    ‘he (the grandfather) came up to there’       Similarly, for temporal senses, it can be used to refer to a specific time during
a specific event, such as I slept up until 7am, implying that the timeframe of the
story continues, but the sleeping was terminated at 7am. The example is given in
(89) below:89) pɨ             siete,             siete=jǔb         wã=beh-ep=hĩ,

      1SG=go-PST=REM.PST
      ‘(I slept) up until 7am, at seven really, I went first thing in the morning up until
      the Sloth Hill’       Syntactically, the terminative marker is unique in that it functions as a
preposition, while no other prepositions are attested in Kakua.

                      Elements of the noun phrase
7.0    Introduction
        This chapter describes other words from closed classes that occur in the noun
phrase. In particular this chapter deals with the description of pronouns,
demonstratives, questions words, numerals and quantifiers in Kakua, and further
additional elements of the noun phrase.
        The noun phrase in Kakua is built according to the template in (1) below.
Demonstratives (DEM), lexical possessors (POSS), pronouns (PN) including
possessive and interrogative pronouns, numerals (NUM) and quantifiers (Quant) all
precede the head noun. A head noun may be a bare noun root (see Chapter 4), a
compound of noun roots (see Chapter 5), or another derived noun (e.g., a
nominalized verb stem, or a noun stem taking some derivational morphology). Any
of the elements shown in (1) below with the exception of modifiers can also function
as a noun phrase on its own. Modifiers of the head noun (adjectives or nominalized
verbs) may precede or follow the head noun (see discussion on adjectives in Chapter
3, §3.2.1).","[229, 230, 231, 232, 233]"

C. Other obligatorily possessed entities
        Terms referring to objects that are closely associated with people or that are
indispensable for subsistence are also inherently possessed. Therefore, nouns
referring to these elements must always be encoded within a possessive construction.
The set of other obligatorily possessed entities includes the followingː          i)            Clan and language affiliation, family, friend-companion, shadow,
                        souls.
          ii)           Some terms denoting emotions and feelings, and nominalized
                        forms of some verbs.108) měm               bâra-ǐʔ           hĩʔhẽʔ fwǐʔ=mɨ ̀n-at            hĩʔhẽʔ

        In addition to the strategies presented above for the expression of possessive
relations, Kakua encodes a possessive relation between nouns referring to animate
entities and a place to which the entity is affiliated (the ‘belonging’ of an animate
referent to a certain place). The morphemes marking this type of possessive relation
are called here associative markers. Associative markers are clitics that have a
singular form =bû ‘ASSOC.SG’, and a plural counterpart =mǔn ‘ASSOC.PL’:114) Colombia=diʔ=bû

                 Argument marking and case marking6.0    Introduction
        This Chapter presents a description of Kakua’s syntactic and morphological
strategies for coding grammatical relations of arguments, and also describes case
marking for adjuncts.
        The grammatical relations of arguments in Kakua are marked by
morphological and syntactic means. An interesting characteristic of the coding of
grammatical relations in Kakua is its mixture of head-marking and dependent-
marking strategies (in terms of Nichols 1986).
        Subject arguments are cross-referenced on the verb (a head-marking strategy),
while object arguments (encompassing any argument in a function other than
subject), receive case morphology, marked on the NPs themselves (a dependent-
marking strategy, see examples 1-3 in Chapter 3).
        Kakua’s alignment is strictly nominative-accusative. Object arguments and
adjuncts receive case marking. This is summarized in Table 6.1 below:Table 6.1 Kakua case markers

pronouns.
       In the subsequent sections of this Chapter I provide a description of the
characteristics of the coding of grammatical relations and case markers in Kakua.
       The expression of subject arguments is described in section §0. Object
arguments in Kakua are morphologically marked by case; this is described in §0.
184      A Grammar of KakuaThe obligatoriness/optionality of overtly marking object case is determined by
Differential Object Marking conditions, this is discussed in §0. Section §0 provides
a description of the marking of case for adjuncts, namely locative,
comitative/instrumental, and terminative case.","[202, 203, 204, 205, 206]"
"7.1    Personal pronouns
       The Kakua pronominal system has three different sets of forms: free forms,
bound pronouns (that serve to express possessive relations as described in §5.3, or
to encode cross-reference to the subject argument as described in Chapter 8), and
possessive pronouns (occurring in alienable possession, described in §5.3). Table 7.1
summarizes the forms and functions of the three sets of pronouns in Kakua.

        As can be seen in Table 7.1, Kakua pronouns encode person and number.
Gender is specified only for the 3 rd person singular forms. The 3rd person singular
pronoun kǎn ‘3SG.M’ is obviously related to the proximate demonstrative form kan
‘PROX.DEM’. The 3rd person singular pronoun kǎn ‘3SG.M’, can in principle be used
for inanimate referents (‘this/it’), and animate male (or unspecified for gender)
referents (‘he’) (it is a non-feminine form, see below) and is glossed in the texts as
‘3SG.M’. For inanimate 3rd person singular referents, the demonstrative form kan is
used most often. Therefore, kan is glossed as either ‘PROX.DEM’ or ‘3SG.M’ according
to the context. If encoding deixis is its main function, then it is glossed as
‘PROX.DEM’, whereas if in pronominal function it refers to an inanimate referent, it
is glossed as ‘3SG.M’. Section §7.3 below describes the forms and functions of
demonstratives in Kakua.
        Gender distinctions in the forms for 3rd singular pronouns are best understood
as feminine versus non-feminine.1 The forms kǎnʔ and mi= strictly encode female
gender for 3rd person singular, while for all other referents, the pronouns kǎn
‘3SG.M’ and ʔã= ‘3SG.M’ are used even when the gender of the referent is not strictly
male, or is unspecified. All of the pronominal forms shown in Table 7.1 above, can
be further specified by feminine gender. This is done by attaching the feminine suffix
classifier -wili:2)      wěm-wili
        1SG-CL:fem
        ‘I (female)’
1
    For the sake of consistency, kǎn, ʔã= and ʔãǰʔ=, are glossed as ‘3SG.M’ throughout this work, even
when the referent is not male.

     chase.away-A.NMLZ
     ‘he was the one who chased away the jaguars’ (he was the jaguar chaser)       The bound pronouns (proclitics) are normally bound to a head noun or verb.
When bound to verbs, the proclitics serve as cross-references to the subject argument
of the clause (see Chapter 6 on argument marking in Kakua).
       The set of pronouns that are called “bound pronouns” can also occur without
being attached to a head noun or verb, but in this case the bound pronoun must
always be followed by another clitic to form a phonological word. The contexts
motivating the constructions of the pronouns without a head noun or verb need to be
explored in future research.
       An example of the proclitic occurring with additional morphology only,
lacking a head noun or verb, is illustrated in (5) below:5)   fwɨb=be               mâ-naʔ          kan      ʔã=be           wɨw
     return=REC.PST        tree-CL:tree     3SG.M    3SG.M=REC.PST caiman     wã=beʔên=tâ=tik                     ʔã=be            wɨw
     1SG=recognize=INF.EVID=INTS          3SG.M=REC.PST caiman
     ‘I came back, (with) a stick I recognized the caiman, he must have been a
     caiman!’        Unlike the free pronouns, the forms of the bound pronouns do not have lexical
tone specification; instead, their tone value is assigned by the elements in the
surrounding environment to which the proclitics are attached (usually the tonal value
is assigned by the roots to which the pronoun is clitized). In cases such as the one
presented in (5) above, where the bound pronoun lacks a head, and instead it occurs
only with other morphology, which are themselves also toneless, the entire set of
bound morphemes is realized with a low tone.
        When pronominal forms function as subjects, objects, or comitative or
locative adjuncts they take case markers indicating their function within the clause:
214     A Grammar of Kakua6)    kǎnʔ       kan=diʔ            mi=t-hěmʔ-ep=wɨt=be
      3SG.F         3SG.M=OBJ        3SG.F=EVID-eat-PST=REP.EVID=REC.PST
      ‘She ate it’ (it is said)       As described in Chapter 5, (bound) pronouns can be used to indicate
possessive relationships. Inalienably possessed nouns take bound pronouns, while
alienably and inherently possessed nouns take the possessive (bound) pronouns (see
Chapter 5, §5.3, for description of possession). As mentioned in Chapter 5 (§5.3),
the possessive pronominal forms in Kakua are derived from a combination of the
bound forms of the pronouns with the possessor marker –íʔ. This is shown in Table
7.1 above in the column of possessive pronouns. An example of an alienably
possessed noun marked with the possessive bound pronoun is given in example (7)
below:7) ʔãjʔ=namǎ=bǔ                   kǎn     kãk=bɨt
   3SG.M.POSS=path=LOC               3SG.M    person=ALSO     ʔãjʔ=namǎ=bǔ
     3SG.M.POSS=path=LOC
     ‘[they parted…], he (the armadillo) on his way, and the person also on his way’        Free pronominal forms do not have variants when used as possessive forms.
        Kakua pronouns can have anaphoric functions, referring back to a previously
mentioned noun or noun phrase, as discussed in Chapter 6 and Chapter 11 (§11.2 on
subject alignment).
          In Kakua narratives, usually a (3SG.M) pronoun is sufficient to refer to the
main participant of the story, and the expression of the participant as a lexical noun
is not necessary. Example (8) below illustrates a situation in which two participants
of the narrated event are being referred to by using 3SG.M pronouns only:8)    kǎn        kǎn=diʔ           ʔã=t-těw-hip=tagǎ
      3SG.M        3SG.M=OBJ         3SG.M=EVID-shot.darts-DUB=INF.EVID
      ‘he (the person) shot darts to him (the jaguar)’       Like the demonstrative form kan (see above), the third person pronoun can
also be used for generic reference to inanimate entities in general, or abstract
concepts like thoughts, feelings, or ideas. The bound pronoun highlighted in bold in
example (9), anaphorically refers to the derived noun higaɁ-at     ̃̂      be.sad-NMLZ
‘sadness’. It can also be translated into ‘it (the sadness)’. Example (10) illustrates an
instance of the pronoun kǎn used for generic anaphoric reference.

7.2     Interrogative pronouns and question words
       The interrogative pronouns in Kakua are built from the element de-, to which
other morphological material is added. The interrogative pronominal forms are given
in Table 7.2 below:Table 7.2 Interrogative Pronouns

  who                                      dêʔe       These pronouns can be used as arguments of clauses, as shown in the
following examples:11) dêʔe=ti=be                    mem=diʔ          ʔã=t-ʔên

    ‘I’m saying, who is going to talk?’       An interrogative mood marker =nit may optionally be cliticized to the verb

    which=INTS          2SG=want=INTERR
    ‘which (one) do you want?’       Interrogative pronouns, as is the case for the rest of the pronominal forms in
Kakua, do not have different forms when functioning as subject, object, comitative,
locative, etc. Thus, if functioning as an object argument, for example, the
interrogative pronoun does not change its basic form and instead it optionally takes
the object case marker, compare examples (15) and (16) with (17) and (18) below:17) dêʔe=diʔ=ti=be                 ma=ʔên
    who=OBJ=INTS=REC.PST            2SG=see

    what=OBJ=INTS 2SG           know
    ‘what (story) do you know?’        Interrogative pronouns can take the possessive suffix -íʔ to encode possessive
relations, as in (19), or be compounded to a noun stem as in (20) below. Note that
in cases such as that illustrated in example (20) below, the interrogative pronoun is
not considered a procliticized form (as with the proclitic personal pronouns) because,
unlike proclitic personal pronouns (possessive personal pronouns), the interrogative
pronoun can stand on its own, like other interrogative words (i.e., can occur
syntactically unbound, like example (23) below where the interrogative dě ‘where’
occurs on its own. Most commonly, however, the interrogative pronouns occur
together with intensifiers or emphasis markers):19) dêʔe-íʔ  tigǎ     nin-mɨ ̃̌-hǐw

    ‘whose dog is this one right here?’            ̃̌

    who-son=OBJ=INTS=REC.PST                 2SG=see
    ‘whose son did you see?’        Kakua has a set of forms that are homophonous to the element de- present in
the interrogative forms: the inferred future evidentiality enclitic =dê ‘INF.FUT.EVID’;
and the noun dê ‘relative’ (‘person who is related). The extent to which these forms
may or may not be related is unknown.

that are also built from the element de-. These question words are given in Table 7.3

Note that in example (22) the particle paʔniʔ ‘and so’ presumably functions as a
clause linker, with the interrogative pronoun initiating a new clause.21) děd=paʔ           fǐt    fĩ=fwîʔ=hĩ

      ‘they stayed there for, hmmm… how many?, another month?’       As seen in this section, Kakua interrogative pronouns and question words are
built on a basic de- form. Semantically, both interrogative pronouns and question
words can be considered to fall into one class of interrogative words. Functionally,
however, these words form two different sets: the set of interrogative words that
have pronominal function, and the set of interrogative words with adverbial
functions.

        Kakua has a demonstrative system which makes three distinctions: proximate,
distal, and immediate proximate. The forms of demonstratives are given in Table 7.4
below:Table 7.4 Kakua demonstrative pronouns
 Function                                            Form Demonstrative Pronoun Proximate ‘there/this’

 Distal ‘that’
                          masculine ‘this right              nin
 Immediate                here’
 proximate                feminine ‘this right               ninʔ
                          here’        The proximate and distal demonstrative forms, kan and kun respectively, can
be specified for gender if necessary (unlike immediate proximate forms, which are
already inflected for feminine gender in their basic form). In such cases, the classifier
-wili may be suffixed to the demonstrative form as follows: kan-wili ‘this (female)’,
and kun-wili ‘that (female)’.
        Additionally, the 3rd person singular feminine personal pronoun, kǎnʔ ‘3SG.F’,
can be used as a demonstrative when referring to female animate beings that are
(spatially) proximate to the speaker, and in such cases it is preferred over kan-wili.
        As mentioned in §7.1 above regarding the 3rd person singular pronoun kǎn
‘3SG.M’, both kǎn ‘3SG.M’ and kan ‘PROX.DEM’ can be used with the same deictic
meaning. It is also possible that the proximate demonstrative form kan was the
historical source of the pronominal forms kǎn ‘3SG.M’ and kǎnʔ ‘3SG.F’ (following a
crosslinguistically common development of 3 rd person pronouns from
demonstrative), but the pronominal forms include further phonological
specifications, which suggests that a reverse development might also be possible.
        The proximate demonstrative kan ‘PROX.DEM’ is used to refer to objects
which are spatially close to speaker, to the hearer or to both. It is not used for objects
immediately next to the speaker, for which the immediate proximate demonstrative,
nin or ninʔ, is used. The proximate demonstrative is also used to refer to something
that has already been mentioned in the discourse, e.g. ‘the one there’, or ‘this
aforementioned’ object. The proximate demonstrative can be translated as English
‘this’ or ‘there’, and is glossed as such where appropriate:27) kan=jǔb=pûʔba
    there=EMPHZ:be.true=EMPH
    ‘right there, all right!’

singular pronouns kǎn ‘3SG.M’ and kǎnʔ ‘3SG.F’, and can function in any grammatical
role in a clause: subject, object, or adjunct:30) kan=diʔ             hɨ ̃̂dʔɨ=diʔ=ka               ʔã=t-beh-ep

    ‘he lived over there also’        The distal demonstrative kun ‘DIST.DEM’ is used to refer to referents far away
from the speaker, hearer, or both (32). Its alternate forms are kǔn and nun. The use
of the distal demonstrative is usually accompanied by a pointing gesture signaling
towards the (imagined, in the case of stories, for example) location of the referred
entity. The referent can be either visible or not visible to speaker and hearer. This
distal demonstrative has an alternate form nun as shown in Table 7.4 above. The
criteria conditioning the use of one over the other seem to correspond to clan dialectal
variation but need to be investigated further.","[233, 234, 235, 236, 237, 238, 239, 240, 241, 242]"

                                                  Introduction: Kakua and its speakers                3        The morphology of Kakua is highly agglutinative (especially in its verbal
morphology), with a combination of head and dependent marking. The language is
predominantly suffixing, with a few prefixes occurring exclusively on the verb.
Kakua has cross-referencing proclitics that agree in person and number with the
Subject/Agent argument of the clause. Third person singular referents have,
additionally, gender agreement of feminine or masculine. Roots are often
compounded to form new words.
        Parts of speech in Kakua can be divided into open classes (nouns and verbs),
and closed classes (adjectives, adverbs, numerals, interjections, and other particles).
          Kakua nominal categories include number, classifiers, diminutive and
augmentative distinctions, and case marking. Nominalization is a highly productive
strategy to derive nouns from verbs. Animacy is particularly relevant for the system
of differential object marking and differential number marking. There are no
prefixing positions in the noun template, unless additional derivational processes
have been applied (Chapter 4).
          Nouns can be further subdivided into alienable and inalienable classes, as
is evident from the system of possession marking (Chapter 5).
        Most of Kakua morphology occurs in the verbal construction. There, prefixes,
suffixes and enclitics encode all of the tense, aspect, mood, and evidentiality (TAME)
distinctions (clitics conveying TAME distinctions can also occur on other word
classes). Likewise, valency changing morphemes, verbal negation, cross-referencing
proclitics, and many markers of discourse also occur in the verb construction. Verb
roots can group together in a very productive grammatical strategy of verb
serialization.
        Kakua’s most common constituent order is verb-final (S)OV, although other
orders are also allowed. It has a nominative-accusative alignment system.","[24, 25]"

which are close (though not immediately next to) to the speaker, to the hearer or to
both. Also, it is used to refer to something that has already been mentioned in the
discourse, e.g. ‘the one there’, or ‘this aforementioned’ object. The meaning of this
proximate demonstrative can be translated as English ‘here’ or ‘there’:46) kan=jǔb=pûʔba
    there=INTS=EMPH
    ‘right there, all right!’       The distal demonstrative is used to refer to objects far away from speaker,
hearer, or both. This distal demonstrative is usually also accompanied by a pointing
gesture towards the distant referent. The referent can be either visible or not visible
to speaker and hearer. An example is given below:
114      A Grammar of Kakua47) pɨ             kun=na            wɨ ̌d-daʔ

      to be, although it is not visible from the point where the speech act is taking
      place)        The emphatic proximal demonstrative is used to refer to a referent that is
immediately proximate to the speaker or hearer. It is also used to refer to the last
element/participant previously mentioned in the discourse, like the latter in English.
Constructions involving the emphatic proximate often imply that the object is within
reachable distance, e.g. this very bark right here. The emphatic proximate
demonstrative has specific forms for feminine and masculine referents. It can be used
to refer to animate as well as to inanimate entities. Examples are given in (48)-(50):48) fwĩ=nɨw-wã       bǎdʔda                   nin=bǔ

    ‘whose dog is this one right here?’3.3.4 Numerals and quantifiers
       Numerals are built up by compounding noun roots (or adjectivized or
nominalized verb roots), plus additional noun morphology such as case marking,
number marking, and classifiers, among others. The numerals 5 and above involve
a generative system consisting of adding terms for fingers and hands to the basic 1-
5 forms.
       The Kakua numeral system has native forms to express numerals from 1 to
20. Although Kakua speakers have reported that this numeral system can be extended
to count for higher numbers than 20, by adding terms of body parts of other
individuals (‘two hands and two feet and one hand from another person’), in actual
practice any quantity beyond five is expressed by using Spanish loans.
       A list of the Kakua cardinal numbers 1-5 is given in Table 3.10 below. A
comprehensive list of all 20 cardinal numbers in Kakua and a detail description of
the numeral system is given in Chapter 7.

                                 ‘with one hand’       In addition to numerals, Kakua has other morphemes that express quantity.
These are: tâwʔ ‘sometimes’, niʔat ‘all/every’, lâ ‘times/era’, dawǎ ‘many’, and henaʔ
‘this much/count/measure’.
         These quantifier-like terms can act as modifiers within noun phrases, or can
occur by themselves as the head of the noun phrase. Examples of these morphemes

     ‘many people were there’
3.3.5 Adjectives
      Adjectives are cross-linguistically defined as a class of words that modify
nouns and that are used for denoting qualities or attributes (c.f., Dixon 2004:1-49,
Schachter and Shopen 2007).
116     A Grammar of Kakua        In Kakua, most attributive or quality meanings are expressed through
descriptive verbs. A small set of words which are not verbs and can be used directly
in attributive modification, however, can be identified.
        The small set of adjectives in Kakua is formed by a total of four adjectives.
Morphologically, these words can take both verb and noun morphology.
Syntactically, the adjective words have a fairly free order and the modifier can occur
either preceding or following the modified noun.
        The adjectives have a likely etymology in verbs, as discussed at the end of
this section. The four Kakua adjectives are given in (53) belowː53) hàp         ‘tall/up’
      hâp       ‘new’
      bɨdǐ      ‘big’
      jehěp     ‘bad’       All other qualities or attributive meanings in the language are expressed by
descriptive verbs. When a descriptive verb is used for expressing an attribute or
quality, the verb root is marked with the adjectivizer morpheme –ni following the
modified noun in juxtaposition.
       The class of adjectives is distinct from verbs and nouns. Unlike verbs,
adjectives can occur as free morphemes without the need of derivational morphology
to function as modifiers of nouns. Unlike nouns, adjectives can take all of the verbal
morphology, and may function as heads of verb phrases.
       The syntactic position of the four adjective words in Kakua is apparently not
fixed, and whereas some speakers prefer an N Adj order, others have no clear
preference for either one, accepting both as being just as good. It must be said,
however, that allowing for either order to occur is much more common in elicitations
than in natural texts, where the modifier tends to follow the modified noun. This
might be explained in that the four adjectives in Kakua have an etymological source
in verbs, and Kakua is predominantly a verb-final language.
       The examples in (54) and (55) below illustrates a case in which the same
speaker uses indistinctly both Adj N and N Adj orders in the same narrative text:54) bɨdǐ        keh
    big          fish
    ‘big fish’55) jòaʔ       bɨdǐ
    backyard big
    ‘big backyard’
                                                Types of morphemes and word classes                  117       The adjectives in Kakua can take nominal morphology as in (56) and be the
head of noun phrases without having to take any word-class changing morphology.as
in (57) and (58):456) měm         hàp=bǔ=ka                 ʔinwɨʔá

         3PL=COM
         ‘he and the young woman went with them’       When descriptive verbs function as attributive modifiers, they are adjectivized
by the adjectivizer suffix –ni.
       The following examples in (59) and (60) below illustrate this adjectival
function of descriptive verbs. Note also the order of constituents where the predicate
remains in final position whereas the adjectivized verb precedes the verb phrase.59) ʔên-é      hěa      dɨpɨ ̌-ni                    ʔã=hɨm=na=ka

    ‘lookǃ the sky is dark’60) wěm                 hodaʔ-na=diʔ                   bǎb-mâʔ-ni
    1SG                  banana-INAN.PL=OBJ             be.ripe-to.age-ADJVZ         wã=hěmɁ-ep=be
         1SG=eat-PST=REC.PST
         ‘I ate the ripe bananas'       This suffix –ni is polysemous. It can also encode agent nominalization when
suffixed to other non-descriptive verbs (verbs of actions, states). This suffix is
          4
              Although from examples (57) and (58) it seems that the classifier can have a nominalizing
function (i.e., acting as derivational morphology), which is a common function of classifiers in many
regional languages (see also nominalization via compounding of classifiers to verbs described in chapter
4), these adjectives can also occur as head of a NP without the classifiers, as can be seen in example (4)
above.
118     A Grammar of Kakuaglossed as ‘ADJVZ’ when functioning as an adjectivizer for descriptive verbs, and as
‘A.NMLZ’ when its function is agent nominalization.5 Examples of its function as
agent nominalizer are given below. A further description of agent nominalization is
given in Chapter 5:61) dɨw-ni
    carry.on.shoulders-A.NMLZ
    ‘the carrier’62) kûʔu-ni
    give.medicine/heal-A.NMLZ
    ‘doctor/healer’       Like verbs, all of the members of the adjective classes in Kakua can take the
adjectivizer/nominalizer suffix –ni:63) hàp-ni
    tall/up-A.NMLZ
    ‘the tall one’64) hâp-ni
    new-A.NMLZ
    ‘newly/young one’65) jehěp-ni
    bad- A.NMLZ
    ‘ugly one’       Attributive meanings such as taller vs. tallest in Kakua are expressed by
comparative constructions involving the verb ʧaʔ ‘be on top’. Examples are given
below. Comparative constructions may also be expressed by the juxtaposition of the
compared elements. Comparative constructions and their attributive meanings are
described in Chapter 13.","[135, 136, 137, 138, 139, 140]"
"        In the present section I explore the semantic and pragmatic properties of the
object argument conditioning DOM in Kakua, showing that object marking is
obligatory on noun phrases with human referents (and a few others). Other features
given by Creissels in the list above, such as formal properties of the noun phrase, or
semantic transitivity of verbal lexemes and their relation with obligatory marking
(c.f., Hopper & Thompson 1980:259, 272; von Heusinger & Niyazmetowa 2008),
are not considered here, but will need further study. Another factor favouring the
overt marking of object case appears to be word order, where OSV order tends to
favour the overt marking of case on the object argument (see Chapter 11, §11.1).
        The criteria conditioning DOM presented here for Kakua should be further
investigated in future research, and many questions remain unanswered for this
version of the description on the grammar of Kakua. Issues regarding topicality, for
example, and the interaction between definiteness and specificity, call for a detailed
study.
        This section is subdivided as follows: animacy and DOM in Kakua are
presented in §6.3.1-§6.3.6 while section §6.3.7 describes DOM and definiteness.
Other discourse related criteria that favours the overt marking of object case in
Kakua (namely definiteness) is given in §6.3.7 below. Future research should be
          3
              E.g., Comrie 1989, Bossong 1985, 1998, Croft 1998, Lazard 1994, 2001, 2003; Dalrymple &
Nikolaeva 2011, Iemmolo 2011.
192         A Grammar of Kakuafollowed in order to establish other possible correlations between DOM and other
areas of the grammar6.1.1       DOM and animacy
       The oligatoriness of object marker in Kakua responds to the animacy of the
noun phrase in object function. Object marking is obligatory on all noun phrases
with human referents. On other object noun phrases, object marking is obligatory if
the object noun phrase is higher on the animacy hierarchy than the subject noun
phrase. Otherwise, the overt marking of object case is optional, and may be favored
by definiteness.
       Object marking and its conditioning by animacy is a relatively common cross-
linguistic phenomenon and in fact seems to have been the most widely explored
conditioning feature for differential object marking across languages, c.f., Comrie
(1989) for references in a broader typological view of DOM; Bossong (1980, 1991,
1998) for Romance, Turkic, some Indo-European languages, and languages of
Australia; Blake (2001) for some aspects of DOM in Hindi; England (1996) for
Mayan languages; for languages of the Vaupés see Aikhenvald (2003, 2012); Zúñiga
(2007), and Epps (2008); Comrie (2008) makes reference to alignment of case
marking in a typological perspective; Campbell & Grondona (2012) for languages
of the Chaco and the southern cone; and O’Connor & Muysken (2014) and Birchall
(2014) for an overview of languages of South America.
       From these studies, we know that the higher the animacy of the object noun
within the hierarchy, the more likely it is that its marking will be obligatory. The
hierarchy governing this is reproduced below from Silverstein 1976 (see also Comrie
1989, and Croft 1991 for more discussion on animacy hierarchies):4                            1 > 2 > 3 > Human > Animate > Inanimate      The rationale behind this is that entities lower on the animacy hierarchy are
very likely to be patients and thus objects therefore do not need to be overtly marked
as such. For instance, nouns referring to human entities are typically agents, whereas
inanimate nouns are typically patients. This disambiguates between agents and
patients in many cases. However, ambiguity can occur when two (or more)
arguments within a clause have potentially the same animacy and thus the possibility
to be agents, e.g. when the object argument has a human referent. This is the reason
why nouns referring to humans when functioning as the object(s) argument(s) of the
clause are obligatorily marked, also in Kakua.
        DOM in Kakua conforms to this animacy hierarchy. All noun phrases with
human referents, including pronouns and demonstratives with human referents, are
obligatorily marked when in object function (demonstratives are obligatorily marked
also for a different reason, namely because they are definite, a pragmatic criterion
that favours the overt marking of object case; see §6.3.7 below). Nouns referring to        4
            Comrie (1989) notes also that pronouns do not really relate to animacy, but to referentiality.
                                         Argument marking and case marking 193a particular small set of animals are also very often (although not obligatorily)
marked, and this is determined by the animacy associated with them in Kakua’s
cultural and mythological conception. Most other animal terms and animate entities
in general are far less often marked (optionally marked). All inanimate terms are
also optionally marked (and may be marked depending on definiteness, topicality, or
disambiguation from other inanimate argument within the clause, see the description
in §6.3.7 below).
       Kakua thus has a cut-off point between obligatory and optional object
marking on the animacy scale between humans and mythological beings, on one side
(including PNs with reference to these), and other animates, and inanimates on the
other side, as summarized in the following figure.","[213, 214, 215]"

6.4.0 Case markers for adjuncts
       The forms and semantic roles of adjuncts in Kakua are given in Table 6.5
below. Note that six semantic roles are coded by case markers for adjuncts: Locative,
Comitative/Instrumental (both coded by =hĩʔ), and Terminative:Table 6.5. Case markers for adjuncts

in that, like adverbs, it modifies verbs or entire clauses. Unlike adverbs, however, it
is more like a grammatical morpheme, and is here glossed as such. This is the
morpheme puʔba which encodes an emphatic meaning similar to the expression
‘right there’ or ‘right that’.
        An example of the emphatic adverbial like morpheme is given in (83)-(84)

   occur on their own, without need of additional inflectional morphology.
b) Adverbs modify verbs and clauses, and encode meanings such as time, degree
   and certainty.
c) Unlike nouns, some adverbs do not take noun morphology such as case marking.
d) Syntactically, adverbs tend to occur at the beginning of clauses.

3.3.7 Particles
        Particles form a small but very heterogeneous classes of words. Particles are
a group of words that –like most adverbs, adjectives and nouns- can occur as
utterances on their own. Unlike adverbs and adjectives, these words do not function
as modifiers.
        Particles do not take any type of derivational or inflectional morphology.
They do not compound together with other elements. Particles are monomorphemic
words.
        Particles can be used as minimal expressions, responses, or reactions in a
discourse. This heterogeneous class of words includes discourse elements like the
hesitation particle nép ‘who was it now?’, or discourse tags like bat ‘dude’, hɨʔ̌ ‘and
what do you knowǃ’, expressions of astonishment like hiw              ̌ ‘no wayǃ’; and
interjections like ʔagá ‘ouch!’. A list of these particles is given in Table 3.12 below:Table 3.12 Particles in Kakua

               The noun: morphology and structure
4.0    Introduction
        This chapter describes the morphology of nouns and the syntactic position of
morphemes in the noun word.
        Most of Kakua nouns are formed by monosyllabic (at most bisyllabic) roots
(c.f., §2.3, Chapter 2, on the syllabic structure of morphemes in Kakua); morphemes
with three or more syllables are exceptional and in most cases are lexical borrowings.
        Kakua has a set of free and bound noun roots. A free noun root in Kakua can
be sufficient as a minimal nominal word; i.e., without need of additional morphology,
a bare noun root can function as head of a noun phrase, as an argument of a verb or
postposition, and also as a nominal modifier.
        Kakua nouns can be specified for number, shape, possession, case, and
definiteness.
        Nouns in Kakua do not take prefixes, and with the exception of proclitics, all
of the noun morphology in Kakua, as is the case for many Amazonian languages
(c.f., Aikhenvald 2012: 131), occurs exclusively after the stem. According to
Aikhenvald (2012:131), it seems to be a fairly common cross-linguistic tendency that
in predominantly suffixing languages, cross-referencing person-marking markers
will be the only morphology occurring in a pre-stem position. In the case of Kakua,
in which morphology is predominantly post-stem, the number of prefixes is very
limited (only two prefixing slots), and the cross-referencing person-marking markers
occur as proclitics.
        Semantically, the elements belonging to the word class of nouns in Kakua
denote animate and inanimate entities, including abstract concepts, substances,
names (like proper and place names), natural and ecological phenomena, among
others.
        This chapter is subdivided as follows: Section §4.1 introduces a description
of the two general types of nouns in Kakua: free and bound nouns. A template of the
noun in Kakua and its morphological categories, such as case, number, and
classification, is described in §4.2. This chapter ends with a description on the
different types of nominalization strategies in Kakua in section §4.3.","[144, 145, 146, 147, 148, 149]"

12.11 Imperative clauses
         Imperative clauses in Kakua are formed by reduplication of the last vowel of
the verb root of the predicate of the imperative clause. The reduplicated vowel
receives an obligatory high tone. The imperative suffix is then by default represented
as -Ṽ́ , where the quality of the vowel is the same as that of the last vowel of the
verb root. This is illustrated in examples (90)-(105):90) ɲi=tɨ ̀j-huj-ú
    2PL=be.good-listen-IMP
    ‘listen carefully!’91) hemʔ-é
    eat-IMP
    ‘eat!’
336     A Grammar of Kakua92) wěm=diʔ nǎwʔ-á=buhú
    1SG=OBJ tell-IMP=DIR
    ‘tell me’5       Like all Kakua clauses, imperative clauses in Kakua are typically verb-final.
Kakua often omits the overt expression of subject NP arguments (although their overt
expression is considered acceptable by speakers, they judge them to be redundant),
for they are usually referred to by means of cross-referencing proclitics on the verb
predicate. Imperative clauses in Kakua tend to omit the subject argument of the
clause more often than other clauses (a cross-linguistic common characteristic of
imperative clauses; c.f., Sadock and Zwicky 1985:171; Aikhenvald 2010:92-97, and
Chapter 2 of the same book). The omission of the subject argument of the clause
occurs more frequently with 2SG forms than with 2PL forms; however, this omission
can be said to be facultative, since instances of the 2PL where the subject argument
is omitted can also occur when context is sufficient to allow for it. The verb root
plus the imperative marker -Ṽ́, without need of further affixes or clitics, can function
as an imperative clause by itself (also a cross-linguistically common feature of
imperative clauses Sadock and Zwicky 1985:171). If additional TAME distinctions
occur, they form a separate clause. Imperative clauses without an overt proclitic are
interpreted by default as having a second person singular subject (93)-(94). Examples
(95) and (96) illustrate imperatives with overt 2PL and 2SG proclitic pronouns
respectively:93) fwɨb-ɨ ̃́
    return-IMP
    ‘come back!’94) ɲaw-á
    run-IMP
    ‘run!’95) ɲi=nêʔ-é                    tɨ ̀j-wẽp-ni

    ‘press strongly!’96) ma=tiw-í
    2SG=shot.with.blowgun=IMP
    ‘shoot!’
         5
             This example can also be analyzed as wěm=diʔ nǎwʔ-ábuhú 1SG=OBJ tell-IMP2, where ‘IMP2’,
is an imperative concerning an action for the benefit of someone else. See the description of this
construction at the end of this section.
                                   Basic clause structure and types of clauses    337       Imperatives can also be used to give commands to other than a 2 nd person
(singular or plural) participants. This is done by adding the appropriate proclitic
pronoun in the imperative construction:97) mi=Ɂên-é
    3SG.F=see=IMP
    ‘may she see!’
98) mi=têw-é
    3SG.F=work=IMP
    ‘may she work!’        Constituent order in imperative clauses is somewhat different from that in
declarative clauses. Imperative clauses do have a verb final order. But if the subject
argument is fully expressed by an NP, then the subject argument most often
immediately precedes the verb. It then follows the object rather than preceding it as
in other clauses, with an OSV order as the result. The fronting of the object argument
in an imperative clause is not an uncommon cross-linguistic feature of imperatives
(c.f., Aikhenvald 2010:92-97). This ordering of imperative clauses in Kakua is
illustrated in examples (99)-(101) below:99) kan=diʔ měm          ma= fwẽh-é
    3SG=OBJ 2SG           2SG=leave-IMP
    ‘leave it!’100) bab-ni=diʔ                    měm     ma=dúk-ú
     be.white-ADJVZ=OBJ            2SG      2SG=sift-IMP
   ‘sift the manioc drink!’101) wã=pebʔ           měm       ma=ɲɨʔ-hɨwʔ-ɨ ̃́
     1SG=be.near        2SG        2SG=stand-come-IMP
     ‘you come stand by me!’       The only evidentiality marker that can occur in combination with imperative
clauses in Kakua is the reported evidential =wɨt, possibly together with the prefix
t- ‘EVID’ (prefix of second hand, nonsensorial evidentiality. See Chapter 10 on
evidentiality) to express that the order has been given by someone other than the
speaker. The use of the reported evidential marker usually serves also to attenuate
the force of the command, making it a more polite imperative. This is often used
when directing orders to elders (102)-(103). Note that the additional evidentiality
specification forms a separate clause, so cannot be directly combined with the
imperative verb:

     ‘take (the manioc) out for grating, it is said’        In fact, imperative clauses in Kakua lack all TAME distinctions in the clause
itself, and all of these distinctions form a separate clause. Cross-linguistically
speaking, this is not an uncommon characteristic of imperative clauses (Sadock and
Zwicky 1985).
        An additional construction expressing imperative solicits the addressee to
perform an action for the benefit of somebody else. The form of this imperative is
-áʔbuhú and it is glossed here as ‘IMP2’. In constructions using this morpheme, the
subject is always a second person, and its overt expression may be omitted. See
examples (104)-(105) below for an illustration of this special imperative ‘IMP2’. This
form can only code a ‘beneficial’ imperative, and no other benefactive or dative like
meanings can be drawn from it.104) ʔɨbʔ=na=ka=tʃãʔ                nih-áʔbuhú

     3SGM=OBJ take.out-IMP2
     ‘take (it) out for him’       Synchronically, -áʔbuhú is considered here to be one single morpheme.
However, because of the phonological (syllabic structure, vowel harmony) structure
of Kakua words, it is likely that that -áʔbuhú is historically at least a complex form.
The etymology of this imperative is not transparent.6
         6
          It might be a lexicalized combination of a morpheme -áʔ and the directional clitic=buh ‘DIR’.
The first element could be a phonologically reduced form of the negative suffix -kan, or it might
correspond to a morpheme that is no longer used in synchronic Kakua. Note that the negative suffix
doesn’t support a semantic motivation for this ‘beneficial’ imperative. Perhaps, the source of the proposed
first element -áɁ, expressed similar semantics of performing an action on behalf of a third party.
Nonetheless, there is no evidence neither in Kakua nor in its sister language Nɨkak that allows me to
strongly claim this hypothesis. The second element of this form would be the directional clitic =buh
‘DIR’, displaying the addition of a reduplicated vowel and high tone, i.e. the regular way to form
imperatives -Ṽ́. I propose the directional clitic as the most likely source of this element in this imperative
marker because of the semantics of this clitic, which comes from a verb root meaning ‘to perform an
action from a distance’ (see note at the end of Chapter 8 regarding the fuzzy verbal-directional identity
                                            Basic clause structure and types of clauses              33912.12 Negative imperative
       Negative imperative clauses require the negative imperative suffix -kabuhú.
This is also clearly a complex morpheme, historically derived from at least two
morphemes. The first part of this morpheme can be identified as the negative suffix
marker -kan/-kap. The second part, however, is less clear, and can have at least two
interpretations. Firstly, it may relate to the directional clitic =buh ‘DIR’, or to the
emphasis function of the clitic =bǔ ‘EMPH’ (see Chapter 8), plus a reduplication of
its vowel. As for now, I have no strong evidence for either of these hypotheses, but
what is clear is that (as with the second imperative described in §12.11 above), given
Kakua’s phonological and morphological rules, this particular negative imperative
morpheme can be considered historically as a complex form.
       The negative imperative morpheme must immediately follow the verb root
(to which no affirmative imperative can be attached): (PN)=Verb-kabuhú :106) ma=ʔɨm-kabuhú
     2SG=be.afraid-NEG.IMPER
     ‘don’t be afraid!’
of this morpheme). Thus, performing on behalf, or for the benefit of somebody else can be equated to
performing an action from a distance. Whenever the clause refers to this specific semantics of performing
an action for the benefit of somebody else, the imperative is expressed with this obscure morpheme
-áʔbuhú, thus it is considered here as one single complex morpheme. In constructions using this
morpheme, the subject argument of the clause is always in the second person, and it may be omitted. See
examples (i)-(ii) below for an illustration of this special imperative ‘IMP2’:
(i)         ʔɨbʔ=na=ka=tʃãʔ                       nih-áʔbuhú
            take.out=DECL=ASS=D.S                  say-IMP2
            ‘(she) is recording, tell her!’
(ii)        kǎn=diʔ                ʔɨ ̃̂bʔ-áʔbuhú
            3SGM=OBJ                take.out-IMP2
            ‘take (it) out for him’
Since it seems to have a beneficial encoding (perform for the benefit of someone else), the following
considerations might be relevant for a future study of this imperative: i) Kakua does not have a dedicated
marker for benefactive roles (see discussion in Chapter 6), ii) many Vaupés languages also do not have
dedicated markers for benefactive roles; iii) Kakua does not have a dative case marker (another possible
source for the development of a benefactive encoding of a form). If the source were a dative case marker,
however, it would be necessary to explain why and how a case marker becomes a verbal morpheme; iv)
many Vaupés languages have been described to lack a dative marker; v) Nɨkak, Kakua’s sister language,
has been described as making five case distinctions, among which a dative; vi) Kakua, as many of its
neighboring groups in the Vaupés, makes three morphological distinctions, for case: Object arguments,
Locatives, and Comitative and Instrumental; vii) Nɨkak’s dative marker is -éʔ (see Mahecha 2009); viii)
there is a regular sound correspondence of Nɨkak /e/ to Kakua /a/. This may be relevant for the complex
benefactive imperative form in Kakua -áʔbuhú; ix) because of Kakua’s phonological (syllabic structure,
vowel harmony) and morphological rules, we know that -áʔbuhú imperative is a complex form.

not contain TAME marking. If the reportative evidential is used, it does not attach
to the predicate together with the negative imperative, but it rather occurs forms
another clause (as in (107) above), and (110) below. The use of a reportative
construction seems to serve a function of making the command more ‘soft’, or more
polite:110) kět=diʔ             Katherine         ma=tû-kabuhú

      ‘Katherine, don’t push them! they have said’       As seen in (110) above, constituent order in negative imperatives clauses is
typically verb final; and whenever both the subject and object are overtly expressed
through a lexical noun or free pronoun, the order of subject and object is inverted
from the typical SOV basic order in Kakua, resulting in OSV (although speakers
accept other orders). The change of the preferred order into an OSV order is typical
for imperative clauses cross-linguistically (c.f., Aikhenvald 2010:92-97).","[356, 357, 358, 359, 360, 361]"

5.3.3 Inalienably possessed nouns
       As stated above, only kinship terms in Kakua are treated as inalienable nouns.
These nouns are obligatorily possessed (unless in vocative form, see below) and their
expression of possession is formed by preposing a proclitic pronoun (not the
possessive form of the pronoun) followed by the possessed noun (PN=N) where no
possessive marker is used. Alternatively, the noun may be compounded to a
possessor noun in inalienable possession (N-N as in Manué-wɨʔ̃̌ ‘Manuel’s son’).13
Note that although these type of N-N compounds is a fairly common construction in
Kakua (see §5.2 above), only N-N involving kinship terms express an inalienable
possessive construction.14
       A table showing the free, bound, and possessive pronouns in Kakua is given
below (see Chapter 7 for description of pronouns in Kakua). Inalienable possession
takes only the bound pronouns (proclitics), and not the free forms of the pronouns:
        13
             In these type of N-N(kinship term) compounds, the motivation for proposing the elements as
being bounded instead of as being juxtaposed, is based on phonological clues. The bounded elements
form a single phonological unit, without possible pauses in between the elements.
        14
             Note, however, that other types of N-N compounds, such as part-whole relations (see §5.1
above) may be comparable to possessive relationships. I consider here only the type of compounds of N-
N involving kinship terms as inalienable because of their strategy of possession marking when not in an
N-N compound. In other words, nouns involved in N-N compounds expressing part-whole relations, for
example, do take possessive prefix or possessive pronouns in other contexts, whereas nouns referring to
kinship terms never do.

Additionally, another term (which is not strictly a kin term) that is treated as

      wã=nɨ ̀wʔ                   ‘my grandfather’

             Note that in the construction for fwĩ=wɨʔ̃̌ ‘nephew’, and fwĩ=nɨm ‘niece’, there is an apparent
ambiguity with the translation. However, in Kakua culture, it seems as if children from the same clan are
in general all regarded as ‘sons’ and ‘daughters’, independently of whether they are or not born to the
same parents.

entity, namely the point of reference for the kinship relation. When the possessor is
unknown or unspecified, the inalienable construction is formed with the 3SG.M
proclitic pronoun ʔã=, expressing possession by an indeterminate being
(‘somebody’s kin’):91)    ʔã=ʧɨ ̂t            ‘his/somebody’s mother in law’
       ʔã=wɨʔ̃̌            ‘his/somebody’s son’
       ʔã=ʔǐp             ‘his/somebody’s father’        Vocative forms of nouns do not express the possessor. Vocative forms of kin
terms thus are not possessed (they do not take any form of possession).
        Vocative forms are typically formed by a reduplication of the stem vowel or
the insertion of a final [a] at the end of the stem. The last syllable receives high tone.
The criteria motivating the choice of the vowel quality – whether reduplication of
the stem vowel or insertion of final [a]-, is unclear at this point.
        Vocative forms are presented here as variations of kin terms, and not as a
grammatical case in Kakua. Case in Kakua is a grammatical category which encodes
a certain grammatical function, and it is not the case for the vocative forms presented
in the list below. Vocative is not considered as a grammatical function, neither as a
suffix encoding a certain ‘vocative’ case. The forms presented here are limited to kin
terms and do not extend as a function (grammatical) case to other nouns. Examples
in (92) illustrate vocative forms of some kin terms. Note that the term for
sibling/cousin does not change in vocative vs. referential forms:       Vocative form                                    Referential form

           ‘Manuel’s son! I (just) saw Manuel’s son!’       Younger generations, however, ever more readily accept possessive
constructions of kin terms involving possessive pronouns, i.e. the set of special
possessive proclitics otherwise used only in alienable possession. This has not
extended to the entire set of kin terms, and the judgment for acceptability of kin
terms with possessive pronouns or bound (non-possessive) pronouns, is unclear. The
following forms were accepted by younger speakers, while rejected by older
generations:       wã=fwan ~ wĩʔ=fwan                 ‘my sister’
       wã=pǔd ~ wĩʔ= pǔd                ‘my cousin’
       wã=ʔɨ ̂d ~ wĩʔ= ʔɨ ̂d              ‘my younger brother’
       wã=ʔibi ~ wĩʔ=ʔibi                 ‘my uncle’        Although these forms were accepted by younger speakers, even they stated
that the constructions with the bound pronouns (not possessive pronouns), “sounded”
better. Forms that were not accepted by either group were: wã=ʔin (*wĩʔ=ʔibi) ‘my
mother’, and wã=mâ (*wĩʔ=mâ) ‘my parents’.
        The use of regular pronoun forms, or juxtaposition of the possessor-possessed
entities without further special marking of possession as a means of expressing
possessors of kinship terms seems to be a fairly common strategy among many of
the languages of the Vaupés linguistic area (cf. Jones & Jones 1991: 61 for Barasano;
Ramirez 1997 for Tucano; Barnes 1999: 218, Miller 1999:48 and Silva 2012 for
Desano; Maxwell & Morse 1999, and Chacón 2012 for Cubeo; Stenzel 2004 for
Wanano; Ospina 2002 for Yuhup; Epps 2008 for Hup). While Kakua does not make
use of free pronominal forms for possessive constructions, its possession strategy for
kin terms is similar to that found in other Vaupés languages:

5.3.4 Obligatorily possessed nouns
        Obligatorily possessed nouns are nouns considered as ‘inherently’ possessed,
that is, they must always occur within a possessor. Nouns that are inherently
(obligatorily) possessed differ from inalienable possession in that the former can
take possessive pronouns, whereas inalienably possessed nouns only occur with non-
possessive bound pronouns (proclitics) or bounded to its possessor (no marking of
possession neither by possessive suffix, nor by possessive pronouns). Additionally,
the possessor of inherently possessed nouns can be marked with the possessive suffix
-ǐʔ whenever the possessor is a full noun.
        Inherently possessed nouns differ from alienable nouns in that, though both
use the same strategy for possession marking, inherently possessed nouns must
always be marked as possessed. The set of obligatorily possessed nouns includes the
following types of nouns:

       Object arguments with the semantic role of patients are illustrated in examples

recipient Hãmu=diʔ ‘Hamu=OBJ’ and the other has the semantic role of theme,

recipients, in addition to beneficiaries, and maleficiaries in both transitive and
ditransitive clauses.
     If both objects of a ditransitive clauses have similar status in terms of animacy,
both usually are marked with the object case marker (see §0 below on differential
object marking criteria). Example (16) illustrates an argument in object function with
the semantic role of recipient. Note also that example (19) shows a source (location)
being marked with the object case marker, this is further discussed below:16) wěm=be                     ̃̌

here as maleficiaries could also be characterized as a goal location (20), and as

    ‘(they’ve) cursed me’ (a curse has been done on me)       If both object arguments are expressed by noun phrases and both are marked
with the object case marker =diʔ (independently of their semantic role), the order
of constituents is fairly free, and speakers will judge as acceptable various different
alternate orders. See the following example, which was recorded from a conversation
(22)a and posteriorly rearranged and presented to speakers during elicitation (22)b:22) a) Ɲɨjʔ-idip      ʔEbebʔ=diʔ        mɨ ̀=diʔ        wɨʔ̀
       Opossum-bone Venom=OBJ           wild.pig=OBJ give
       ‘Opossum Bone (ɲɨjʔidip) gives Venom (ʔebebʔ) a wild pig’      b) Ɲɨjʔ-idip      mɨ ̀=diʔ          ʔEbebʔ=diʔ      wɨʔ̀
         Opossum-bone wild.pig=OBJ Venom=OBJ              give
         ‘Opossum Bone (ɲɨjʔidip) gives Venom (ʔebebʔ) a wild pig’        Both of these examples were judged by speakers to have the same meaning.
Both examples have two possible interpretations: ‘Opossum Bone gives wild pig to
Venom’ or ‘Opossum Bone gives Venom to wild pig’, where Opossum Bone and
Venom stand for proper names or nick names of two males, and wild pig refers to
an animal. This shows that the order of the two objects is free. In the case of example
(22), since the reading ‘Opossum Bone gives Venom to wild pig’ is pragmatically
                                                   Argument marking and case marking 191odd, speakers usually interpret this sentence with the reading ‘Opossum Bone gives
wild pig to Venom’ even when both readings are acceptable.
       Even though the ordering of objects is syntactically free, I have observed
when doing elicitation that speakers tend to more readily accept an order in which
the participant with a lower/less agentive-like semantic role is placed to the left of
the argument with higher/more agentive semantics.
         In addition to arguments in patient, theme, recipient, beneficiary, and
maleficiary roles, the object marker also occurs on noun phrases with the role of goal
(see example (41) below), and source as in (19) above.","[210, 211, 212, 213]"
"6.3.7 DOM and definiteness
        Another typologically common condition on DOM is the definiteness of the
object argument (c.f., Comrie 1989; Iemmolo 2011), and the related notion of
specificity. By definiteness, I mean that the speaker assumes that the hearer can
identify the referent, by indefinite reference that he/she does not. Indefinite reference
can be further divided into specific reference and nonspecific reference. In the case
of specific reference the referent that cannot be identified by the speaker is known
to the speaker, in the case of nonspecific reference the referent is not known to the
speaker. A hierarchy for increasing likelihood of overt object marking relative to
definiteness and specificity is proposed by Croft (2003: 132) (see also Givón 1984:
387):
                               definite < specific < nonspecific
204       A Grammar of Kakua        Note that obligatoriness of object marking in Kakua is determined by animacy
(and whether it is a pronoun). In Kakua, the definiteness of a noun phrase increases
the likelihood that object case markers are used, but case marking on definite noun
phrases is still optional, as examples (47)-(49), among others, show. The following
example illustrates object marking on a definite noun phrase, where it is optional
according to animacy.63) hiw-wã        tɨh=diʔ            hěmʔ=nit=diʔ
    jaguar-PL      turtle=OBJ         eat=S.S=OBJ      ʔã=t-hɨjbi-huj-up=wɨt=hĩ
      3SG.M=EVID-arrive.here-hear-PST=REP.EVID=REM.PST
      ‘he heard when the jaguars were eating the turtle’ (the one that the man had left
      behind)         Example (64) below, illustrates the case where the argument hiw ‘jaguar’ has
no case marker, showing that in terms of animacy, it is optionally marked. The fact
that it is not definite, adds to the likelihood that it is not marked in this example.64) hiw            nin-pâʔ           hiw      paʔ̃̂ -ɲɨʔ       nin-pâʔ

      ‘a jaguar like this, on this side a jaguar was standing across, I found a jaguar
      standing across (the path)’       Inanimate nouns are also more likely to be marked when definite, as in the
following examples (definite: (65) vs. indefinite: (66)). Note also that Kakua does
not have dedicated definite articles, and that having a pronoun preceding the noun
serves as definiteness marking:       ̃̌

"
5.3.1 Alienable possession
        Alienable nouns are those that when possessed take the possessive form of
the pronouns (see Table 5.4 below), or can also be marked with the possessive suffix
-ǐɁ ‘POSS’. Most nouns in Kakua are possessed through this strategy. When the
possessor is a full noun, in an alienable possessive construction, the possessor is
suffixed with the possessive morpheme -ǐʔ (examples (85)-(86) below). Note that
this suffix could be called a genitive case marker. However, it occurs in a different
morphosyntactic slot than other case markers, i.e., because it occurs on the dependent
                         Noun compounding, noun classification and possession 171rather than the head of the NP. For this reason is best not to understand this suffix
as a grammatical case morpheme.","[192, 193]"
"6.3.2. Object marking on personal pronouns

    ‘They killed and ate people (is said)’     Before illustrating DOM and personal names, it is important to first briefly
explain the various Kakua personal names. People usually have a vernacular name
which is regarded as a nickname and corresponds to either an animal that represents
them, or to the sound that a certain animal makes. Additionally, many people might
have a name given by the shaman, known as their ‘blessing name’. Nonetheless, with
the cultural changes incurring in Kakua’s present lives, many people have not been
given their blessing name; a blessing name is often a compound including cultural
terms as well as the name of an animal. All Kakuas are now also given a name in
Spanish.
     During his or her lifetime, a person can go through several nicknames. The
blessing name is used by the shaman when a person is in need of traditional healing
prayers or prayers for the prevention of illnesses. Examples of these names are given
in Table 6.3.","[215, 216, 217]"

3.3.1 Pronouns
       In this section I describe the pronominal paradigm in Kakua. This section is
intended as an overview only; for a detailed description and discussion of Kakua’s
pronominal forms and the pronominal system see Chapter 7.
       Kakua has distinct forms for free and bound personal pronouns. Free
pronouns can function as arguments without the need for extra affixes. The bound
pronouns (proclitics) always precede a noun or verb. When cliticized to nouns, the
bound pronouns express possessors. When cliticized to verbs, the bound pronouns
function as cross-referencing proclitics of the subject argument of the clause. Unlike
the free pronouns, bound pronouns do not have tone specification by default and
instead their tone value is assigned by the elements following the bound pronoun.
       Pronouns functioning as subject or object arguments of a clause take case
markers.
                                       Types of morphemes and word classes          111         Personal pronouns are specified by number (singular and plural), and person
(first, second or third person). Gender distinction in Kakua is specified only for third
person singular.
         The Kakua pronouns are summarized in Table 3.5 and discussed in detail in
Chapter 7.","[132, 133]"

           I have chosen to give different glosses here, even though it might be the case that the suffix
-ni is actually acting as a nominalizer in both cases. If this was the case, examples like the one in (60)
could be interpreted as ‘the ripe one’ (i.e. a noun-noun compound). Likewise, example in (61) dɨw-ni ‘the
carrier’ could be interpreted as ‘(the one who is a) carrier'. It may thus be that the difference between
what I am labeling ‘ADJVZ’ versus ‘A.NMLZ’ has to do merely with the modifier vs. head status of the
element taking -ni (and maybe the active vs. stative status of the verb that is undergoing the derivation),
as opposed to an actual dual function of the suffix. Therefore, the difference in glossing does not
necessarily reflect a strong distinction in the function of this suffix, but rather, it is used to indicate the
type of derivation best reflects the translation.

    ‘he (the) tiny one’        Before concluding this section on Kakua adjectives, the following paragraphs
discuss the origins of Kakua adjectives.
        Synchronically Kakua adjectives behave differently from descriptive verbs,
but good hypotheses can be made with regard to the etymological origin of these
words.
        The adjectives hap ‘tall/up’, and hâp ‘new’ could be derived from the spatial
noun hâbʔ ‘up river’. In this case, hypothetically, the noun hâbʔ ‘up river’ developed
tone differentiations as well as the devoicing of the final consonant. However, an
argument for a reverse process can also be proposed. In other words, it could also
be that the spatial noun hâbʔ ‘up river’ has been derived from the adjectives hap
‘tall/up’ and/or hâp ‘new’. This last argument, however, does not explain why other
spatial nouns have no clear resemblances with adjectives. 6 I consider these to be less
likely scenarios for the development of these adjectives. An alternative scenario
follows.
        Another possible scenario is that both hap and hâp derived from the verb hâ
‘to get up’ plus the past marker of verbs, -Vp, resulting in the inflected form hâ-ap
‘get.up-PST’. This is a more likely scenario, for at least three reasons: First, because
it is consistent with the general pattern that adjectival concepts are expressed through
descriptive verbs, so that one may expect that the attributive concepts ‘tall, up, new’
have initially been descriptive verbs. Second, because it is consistent with the
analysis for the other two Kakua adjectives bɨdǐ ‘big’and jehěp ‘bad’, which will
leave us with one general explanation for the origin of a closed class of adjectives,
coming from verbs, instead of several different strategies for obtaining adjectives as
       6
           Note that in either of these scenarios the semantic link of ‘new’ remains unclear.
120   A Grammar of Kakuaa separate class from verbs and nouns. Finally, adjectives in Kakua can function as
verbs, taking all the available verbal morphology, suggesting that adjectives in Kakua
have a verbal origin.
        The same argument given above to account for the derivation of the adjective
words hâp ‘new’, and hap ‘tall/up’, can serve to explain the diachronic development
of the adjective word jehěp ‘bad’. It could be argued that jehěp ‘bad’ is a lexicalized
form from the verb jěh ‘be.damaged’ plus the general past marker –Vp: jěh-ep
‘be.damaged-PST’. Because of phonological processes, the realization of a rising tone
in a bisyllabic morpheme is assigned to the last syllable, and thus, the tone of the
verb root jěh ‘be.damaged’ has its realization in the last syllable when it has been
lexicalized as a bisyllabic adjective jehěp.
        The word jehěp can function as an adjective or as a verb, as shown in (70).70) kan          ʔã=jehěp=be
    3SG          3SG=be.bad=REM.PST
    ‘it was bad’         Perhaps the least etymologically transparent of the four adjectives in Kakua
is bɨdǐ ‘big’. However, even when its source is not clear, the fact that it can occur
both as a verb and as a free form (adjective), without the need of the adjectivizer
marker –ni, can serve as a sign to suspect its verbal origin. I acknowledge, however
that it is cross-linguistically common for adjective to share properties with either
nouns or verbs. My argument is based on the large number of descriptive verbs that
in Kakua serve to describe properties of nouns.
         The examples in (71)-(73) below illustrate the adjective bɨdǐ ‘big’ used as an
attributive modifier (with animate and inanimate entities):71) teluʧaʔ               bɨdǐ      ʔĩ=t-bibuʔ-hip=tagǎ

     ‘there was a big house’73) bâkaʔ        bɨdǐ
     body         big
     ‘fat person/big person’       Like some verbs, the adjective bɨdǐ can also function as an adverb. When
functioning as an adverb, bɨdǐ occurs at the beginning of the clause, as in examples
(74) and (75) below, and its semantic meaning is that of ‘very much’:

    very.much 1SG=older.brother=OBJ 1SG=love-count-listen=DECL
    ‘I love and rely on my brother very much’       The main features of the closed class of adjectives can be listed as follows:a) Adjectival concepts in Kakua are generally expressed through descriptive verbs.
b) Attributive modification is expressed by adjectivized verbs, noun compounding
   or noun classification.
c) The adjectivizer suffix is –ni. It can be attached to (descriptive) verb roots to
   form adjectives. When attached to other verb roots (other than descriptive
   verbs), it can also function as agent nominalization.
d) The adjective or adjectivized element has free syntactic order, although normally
   it follows the modified element, it may also precede it.
e) The four adjectives identified in Kakua are items expressing the notions of ‘big’,
   ‘tall/up’, ‘new’, and ‘bad’. These four forms can be used as free forms (as
   attributive concepts or modifiers), or as heads of a predicative construction.
f) The four attested adjectives do not take pronominal prefixes.
g) They share a number of features with verbs and some other features with nouns.
   Unlike nouns, adjectives can take verbal morphology and can be nominalized.
   And unlike verbs, adjectives can take nominal morphology.
h) Adjectives are synchronically monomorphemic, but some are probably
   historically derived3.3.6 Adverbs
        Like in the case for quality or attributive modification, modification of verbs
and clauses in Kakua is mostly expressed by verbs. However, there is a set of words
that are not verbs and that can also serve to modify verbs and clauses. These adverbs
are morphosyntactically different from verbs and nouns.
        Although most members of this set of words have a clear etymological source
in verbs, they can be morphosyntactically distinguished from verbs in that they can
occur as free morphemes, whereas verbs must always occur with additional
inflectional morphology (see Chapter 8 for discussion of the exceptional cases when
verb roots can occur as free morphemes).
         Most adverbs can constitute a sentence on their own, like nouns. Unlike
nouns, however, some adverbs cannot take case marking. Also, unlike nouns,
adverbs can take verbal morphology.
        On the basis of their syntactic behavior adverbs can be divided into two sets.
A set of adverbs that occurs at the beginning of the clause they modify, and a set of
adverbs that occur as particles at the end of the clause that they modify.
122           A Grammar of Kakua       Manner meanings in Kakua, such as ‘quickly’, ‘strongly’, ‘well’, are
expressed by verbs: wajkan=na ‘be.quick=DECL’, wẽp=na ‘be.strong=DECL’,
tɨj=na ‘be.good/be.well=DECL’.
       Kakua adverbs express meanings typical of time adverbs and adverbs of
degree.
       A list of these adverb words is given in Table 3.11 below.","[140, 141, 142, 143, 144]"

A.        Body parts
        In principle all terms referring to body parts in Kakua are obligatorily
possessed; they must always be preceded by N-ǐʔ (the inalienable strategy of using
plain bound pronouns, shown in Table 5.5 above, is not used for body parts), or can
be bound to the possessor forming part-whole relations (see discussion for (105)
below), and body part terms used in numerals (see Chapter 7 for description of
numerals)
        When the possessor of a body part is unspecified or unknown, the term
referring to such body parts must occur with the possessive pronoun for 3SG
masculine ʔãǰʔ= ‘3SG.M.POSS’:100) ʔãǰʔ=têjʔja           ‘his/somebody’s hand’
      ʔãǰʔ=híʧa             ‘his/somebody’s foot’
      ʔãǰʔ=pĩh             ‘his/somebody’s tail’
      ʔãǰʔ=haʔ              ‘his/somebody’s mouth’
      ʔãǰʔ=wɨ ̀k            ‘his/somebody’s nose’
      ʔãǰʔ=nem              ‘his/somebody’s guts’101) miǰʔ=mǎw-na                             ‘her teeth’ (3SG.F.POSS=tooth-PL)
      ʔiʔ=mǎw-na
        ̃̌                                     ‘their teeth’

     3SG.M.POSS=tail-CL:log=OBJ tip-CL:tree             1SG=see-PST=REC.PST
     ‘I saw the tip of his tail (the alligator’s)’       Most numerals in Kakua are composed of body parts terms, e.g. hands,
fingers, feet (a description of Kakua numerals is given in Chapter 7). Although when
used as numerals body part terms are not considered as being possessed per se, the
bound construction may be akin to a possessive construction:103) mâw=diʔ                 beh=na           bǐk=hĩʔ=bǔ             têjʔja
     kill=OBJ                 go=DECL          one=COM=EMPH              hand(five)      jěw-hâp
      sun-new
      ‘(they would) go hunt for five days’ (five = with one hand)
                        Noun compounding, noun classification and possession 179         Compounding of two body part nouns serves a possessive function of the
part-whole type. Note that in this type of construction there is no use of a possessive
proclitic or possessive pronoun on either element. I interpret this lack of a possessor
on an otherwise obligatorily possessed noun as an indication that the compound in
itself is sufficient to express the possessive relationship, since the body part terms
are not occurring on their own as free roots. However, the different marking when
taking a proclitic pronoun sets them apart from inalienably possessed nouns, since
these body part terms do take possessive pronouns as opposed to inalienably
possessed kin term nouns:104) mã̌w-dep              ‘gums’ (tooth-flesh)
     pâwa-idǐp-na         ‘ribs’ (rib-bone-PL)
     haʔ-jǔ                ‘beard’ (mouth-hair)           As described in section §5.2 inanimate nouns can be specified for shape by
taking shape classifier suffixes. Body part terms are also specified for their shape as
illustrated in the following examples. In these compounds too, possessor marking is
absent, but I follow the same assumption made for the previous examples in (104)
above, where the compound in itself has a possessive function. In any case, nouns
referring to body parts do not occur on their own, and must have some kind of bound
morphology, be it a possessive pronoun, another noun (N-N), a noun classifier (N-
Nclassifier), or other morphology:105) mǎw-paʔa              ‘jaw’ (tooth-CL:concave)
     wâw-daʔ               ‘head’(head-CL:round)
     mɨh-naʔ                ‘arm’ (arm-CL:tree)
     wɨ ̂-naʔ               ‘leg’ (leg-CLːtree)B. Part-whole relationships
        Nouns whose referents are considered to be inherently part of another referent
(like plant parts as seen in 5.2 above in the description of classifiers) are obligatorily
bound. In such constructions, N1 corresponds to the whole and N2 to its part (see
§5.1 above on noun compounding strategies and productivity). Examples of these
part-whole relations are given below:106) ʔɨ ̃̌ʔ-tâʔ-kit
     blowgun-base.of.blow.gun-CLːlog
     ‘mouth piece of the blowgun’107) mɨh-fwẽ̌h
     river-other.side
     ‘shore’
180    A Grammar of Kakua        What sets these examples apart from inalienably possession is that when
possessed via a pronoun, the possessive pronoun is used, instead of the bound (non-
possessive) pronoun, which is exclusively the inalienable strategy. Thus, to express
that the mouth piece of the blowgun pertains to somebody, e.g., ‘my mouth piece of
                                                     ̃̌
the blowgun’, the relation will be expressed as wiʔ=ʔɨ    ̃̌ʔ-tâʔ-kit, using the possessive
form of the pronoun, and not as *wã=ʔɨ ̃̌ʔ-tâʔ-kit with the non-possessive pronoun.","[200, 201, 202]"
"        The immediate proximal demonstrative nin, or feminine ninʔ, glossed as
‘this.M’ or ‘this.F’ to avoid long glosses, is used to refer to an entity that is
immediately proximate to the speaker or hearer. It is also used to refer back to the
last referent previously mentioned in the discourse, like English ‘the latter’.
        Constructions involving the immediate proximate demonstrative often imply
that the object is reachable rather than pointable, e.g. ‘this very bark right here’. This
immediate proximate demonstrative has dedicated masculine (i.e. non-feminine,
including inanimate) and feminine forms. In (35) it is marked with the locative case
clitic =bǔ. In (36) it is compounded to a nominalized verb.35) fwĩ=nɨw-wã       bǎdʔda                     nin=bǔ

    ‘this (female) liar’        Before turning to numerals (§7.4 below), note that feminine forms ( nin and
ninɁ ‘this.F’ vs. nin ‘this.M’ and kǎnɁ ‘3SG.F’ vs. kǎn ‘3SG.M’) might have historically
developed from an added glottal stop in final position to signal feminine gender.
Presumably, the glottal stop was once detached from the synchronic pronominal
forms, marking feminine gender and, with time, got phonologically fused to the
pronoun form giving rise to a pronominal distinction of feminine versus masculine
pronominal forms.
222    A Grammar of Kakua7.4    Numerals
       Numerals in Kakua are fairly transparent in their etymological source, with
the exception of the numbers ‘one’ and, to some extent, ‘three’. Numerals are built
by compounding noun roots (or adjectivized or nominalized verb roots), plus
additional noun morphology such as case marking, number marking, and classifiers,
among other nominal (and verbal) morphology. Terms referring to numerals four
and above involve a generative system consisting of adding terms for fingers and
hands to the basic forms for one to four.
       Having an obscure etymological status, or unanalyzable forms, for the
numerals one and three, as in Kakua, is not uncommon for languages spoken in South
America, as is having a form for ‘four’ that involves a form meaning ‘companion’
and a reflexive marker (cf., Epps et al. 2012; Epps 2013).
       Table 7.5 below summarizes the forms used for the cardinal numbers one to
five and gives the morpheme glossing identifying their etymological sources.","[243, 244]"

11.2. Alignment
       The alignment system in Kakua conforms to the prototypical nominative-
accusative type, whereby the intransitive subject and the most agentive argument of
a transitive clause are expressed in the same way, but different from the least
agentive argument of a transitive clause: A=S≠O. Because intransitive subjects (S)
and the most agentive arguments of transitive clauses (A) are treated equally in
Kakua, I refer to both as ‘subjects’. Subject arguments are not morphologically
marked by case. Cross-referencing proclitics attach to the verb and agree in person
and number with the subject arguments of the clause. All other arguments (i.e.,
arguments functioning in any role different from subject) are morphologically
marked for case, if the requirements for differential object marking are met (see
Chapter 6). Alignment of object arguments is neutral, meaning that object arguments
308     A Grammar of Kakuain the semantic roles of patients, themes, and recipients are all encoded in the same
way: P=T=R (see Chapter 6).
        The morphological marking of arguments in Kakua shows both head and
dependent marking (in terms of Nichols 1986). While subject arguments are head-
marked (morphologically indexed on the predicate), object arguments are dependent-
marked by morphological case markers on the object NPs.
        The remainder of this chapter is divided into two parts. Section §11.3 focuses
specifically on the alignment of subjects, while section §11.4 describes the alignment
of objects. A summary is given in §11.5, listing the most relevant information
regarding alignment in Kakua.","[328, 329]"

three sets are represented. In (44) the noun referring to the jaguar in object function
is marked. Since the jaguar is lower on the animacy hierarchy than a 2 nd person
subject, this marking is optional (see §6.3.1). In (45), the noun referring to the
monkey is optionally marked, maybe because the monkey could also be the agent of
the clause in the particular context in which this example occurred, to avoid
ambiguity, or because the monkey is a relatively big animal. Finally, example (46)
features a rather small sized animal, which is unlikely to be the agent of the clause,
and thus left unmarked (note that my informant stated that it may as well be marked,
and still judged a grammatical sentence):44) kãk                ʔã=t-těw=hip=tagǎ                            hiw=diʔ

important animal, and thus higher on the animacy hierarchy than the object noun
phrase (‘dog’), so the object marker in this constellation should be optional. The
elicited example (49) above illustrates that in this constellation object marking is
indeed optional.50) hiw         mɨhiw=diʔ         ʔã=ʧã̌k=na=ka

mothers, with indications regarding the care of children), and ‘frogs’ are important mythological beings,
considered to be ancient siblings and referred to in the story as their ancient ‘mothers’. Note also that the
noun Hamu in example (56) refers to a sloth bear named Hamu.
202      A Grammar of Kakua6.3.6 Inanimates
       Marking of object case for inanimate noun phrases is optional. Whether they
are marked for object case can be predicted to some degree on the basis of their
definiteness or possibly other discourse related characteristics (i.e., marking of object
case for inanimate noun phrases occurs in some contexts but not others, and when it
does occurs, it might be required by contexts rather than based on the speaker’s
choice). However, in elicitation object case marking on inanimate noun phrases is
always judged acceptable by speakers. Thus, the overt marking of object case for
inanimate entities in object function is not ungrammatical in Kakua, but commonly
omitted. See examples (57)-(58) below where inanimate entities in object function
are marked:57) tɨ ̃̂=diʔ            mâw-a=ka

    ‘pick up the fire wood’58) namǎ=na        ̀

      ‘in the pathway, they slept in a hut’       Compare these to examples (59)-(60) below, where the object argument is
inanimate and left unmarked. Speakers will accept either the marked or the unmarked
options of these examples:59) wěm        wɨ ̃̌ʔ-daʔ-na                 wâj=tʃãh=na=ka

hodaʔ ‘banana’, and tʃɨ ̃̂ ‘pineapple’ in example (61) are all marked. This example
comes from a conversation, and when asked, speakers agreed that these arguments
could have been left unmarked as well without affecting the interpretation of the
utterance:

     ‘over there, this year, when my work is finished I will plant banana, then I will
     plant pineapple’      To avoid ambiguity, constructions involving the interaction between
inanimate referents in two or more argument positions require obligatory object
marking. See example (62) below. If in this example the object argument is
unmarked, it is judged ambiguous by speakers:62) mâ-naʔ                 mɨ=diʔ           ʔã=t-dah-mâw=na=ka

      ‘the tree will probably break the house’ (if it falls onto it)       Examples like the ones in (58) and (61) above (also example (80) below) raise
an important question for future research. In these examples (and many others), the
object marker occurs with some sort of goal function (like in húptʃi=diʔ ‘year=OBJ’
in example (61), or wãptʃǐ=diʔ ‘manioc.field=OBJ’ in (58), or location function as
in Wacará=diʔ=mǔn ‘wacara=OBJ=ASSOC.PL’ in (80) below). This suggests a
possibility of describing the object case marker =diɁ ‘OBJ’ as a marker of non-
subject function, rather than strictly an object marker. See also further discussion in
§6.4.1 below regarding marking of object case in adjuncts.","[221, 222, 223, 224, 225]"
"4.1    Free and bound nouns
       Kakua nouns can be divided into two types of nouns; nouns that are
obligatorily bound (i.e., noun stems that cannot occur without additional
morphology), and nouns that can occur freely (i.e., without need of any further
morphology).
128       A Grammar of Kakua        Bound noun stems are almost all obligatorily possessed. These include, but
are not restricted to, nouns with human referents, like kinship terms, but also nouns
denoting body parts, parts of a bigger entity, hunting and personal instruments. Also
included in this group of obligatorily bound noun stems are a large number of nouns
referring to inanimate entities which must be specified by a shape classifier suffix.
The nature of these nouns is further described in Chapter 5 (on compounding,
classification, and possession of nouns in Kakua), which also includes a discussion
on the status of classifiers. Bound nouns thus require a possessive pro-form
preceding the obligatorily bound noun (see Chapter 5 for a description of possession
in Kakua, obligatoriness and the alienable/inalienable distinctions).
        Kinship terms in Kakua, for example, are obligatorily possessed.
Furthermore, they are possessed via a strategy of inalienable possession in which
they take a proclitic pronoun, and not possessive pronouns (see Section §7.1 in
Chapter 7 for a description of pronominal forms in Kakua):1)    a. wã=ip           b.       Ɂĩ=hî             c.      mi=nɨm
          1SG=father               3PL=son.in.law             3SG.F=daughter
          ‘my father’              ‘their son in law’         ‘her daughter’

          father                   son.in.law                 daughter       Nouns that can occur as free forms without need of additional morphology
include proper names, nouns referring to animals, vocative forms of kinship terms,
elements referring to parts of the natural environment (e.g., dirt, star, sun, dawn),
and some objects that do not need to be specified by shape classifiers.3)    a. bɨ ̌bʔ           b.       ʔîm                c.      Ɂetá
          ‘louse’                  ‘lake’                     ‘grandmother.VOC’4.2     Noun template
       Nominal morphology in Kakua is by far less complex than verbal
morphology. Kakua nouns never take prefixes. With the exception of proclitics
(including possessive proclitics which obligatorily precede bound nouns), the
morphology of nouns in Kakua is exclusively post-stem, and this includes suffixes
and enclitics.
       Free noun roots can stand on their own as the only obligatory element to form
a noun word in Kakua, unlike verbs (see §3.1.1 and Chapter 8 for verb morphology).
Free nouns roots can also function as arguments of a predicate or as an attributive
modifier of another noun.
       Of all of Kakua’s word classes, only nouns can be specified for possession.
Nominal negation is expressed through existential negation constructions (see
Chapter 12, §12.7 for a description on existential negation constructions).
                                        The noun: morphology and structure      129        The positions of morphemes in nouns is summarized in Table 4.1. Only the
root (in boldface) is obligatory in forming a noun word in Kakua, except in the case
of bound nouns (see §4.1). While free nouns will not require more than a noun root,
obligatorily bound nouns require additional nominal morphology, these being
proclitics, or classifiers. Some nouns can have more than one root (see §5.1 in
Chapter 5 on noun compounding and classifiers). The noun word (as a grammatical
word) ends at position 5. Nouns (as phonological words) may include clitics
(positions 6-10).","[149, 150, 151]"

from a distance far from the actor) do not satisfy the criteria of freedom of host
                                           Types of morphemes and word classes        99selection. However, they are still being described as clitics here, because they occur
after a string of clitic positions of their host. Thus, describing them as affixes would
fail to account for the identity of the morphemes (clitics) which precede these set of
clitics which do not have freedom of host selection.
        The status of case markers as clitics vs. affixes will be discussed in some
detail here, as one example how clitics can be distinguished from affixes in Kakua.
Case markers have freedom of host selection in that they attach to nouns and
adjectives (which share some, but not all characteristics of nouns, see section 3.3.5).
On the other hand, case markers may only occur on verbs if these are in the
subordinate clause (see Chapter 12 for a description of subordinate clauses in
Kakua). Case markers also display a greater freedom of movement than affixes in
two further respects. Firstly, they can occur on only one element of the noun phrase,
rather than on each individual elements of the noun phrase (examples (4)-(8), which
can be the second (4)-(6) or the first element (7).4) mâw-bɨ ̂di-ip=wɨt=hĩ                      [nin-dê]=diʔ

      (long ago when the eclipse was passing) they asked the dead cadaver’ (Spanish
      ‘el cadaver finado’)        Affixes, unlike any other type of morpheme in Kakua (this includes clitics
and all of the word classes), can have syllables without onsets (see Table 3.3 below),
or consist of just a consonant (Table 3.4). Also, only affixes can have unspecified
vowels in their underlying structure. Thus, they allow for the copying of the vowel
quality of the host to which they attach. As mentioned above, affixes do not have
freedom of host selection. A list illustrating some representative examples of suffixes
in Kakua and their hosts is given in Table 3.3 below:Table 3.3 Examples of suffixes in Kakua

encoding second hand evidentiality in its reduced form t- (see Chapter 10 for
description of evidentiality), when preceding a consonant-initial stem (prefix-CVC),
violate the phonological restriction in Kakua that disallows consonant clusters. Note
that exceptions to phonological restrictions in Kakua occur for other affixes as well
(e.g. vowel copying and the onset-less syllables mentioned above). In what follows
of this section, I present a set of three enclitics that can attach to various word classes
to express emphasis or intensity of that constituent. These forms are: = jǔb, which
serves as an intensifier to nouns, with the semantic meaning of ‘truly’, or ‘really’.
Example (9) illustrates this verb root jǔb ‘be true’, from which this intensifier
derives, occurring within a verbal construction. Example (10) shows the function of
=jǔb as an intensifier of a pronoun:9) panʔni=tiʔ           nih-ip wɨd-jǔb=na=hĩ
    and.so=INTS         say-PST swallow-be.true =EMPH=DECL=REM.PST

    fire.wood burn-finish          3SG.M=OBJ=INTS                 burn
    ‘once the fire was on, (I) burned him really’        This intensifier has freedom of host selection, and it can as well occur with
another adverb, intensifying the meaning of the adverb to which it attaches. This is
illustrated in (11) below:11) fɨ ̂b-hɨ ̌j=nit=na               kǎn=diʔ           bɨká=jǔb

     ‘when we returned we burned him really at last, at last!’
102   A Grammar of Kakua        In addition to the intensifier =jǔb ‘truly’ illustrated above, Kakua narratives
are full of the intensifier enclitic =ti ~ =tiɁ. Its meaning is that of an affirmation
such as ‘truly’ or ‘exactly’. This intensifier =ti can also occur with both, nouns and
verbs:12) ʔã=t-hɨw̌ ʔ=hĩ=tiʔ          pɨ                   wẽp-ep=héʔ

     ‘the grandfather Sabino, in reality was my dad’       The intensifier enclitic =ti ~ =tiɁ occurs commonly in interrogative clauses,
with interrogative pronouns and question words, and in adverbial particles such as
paniʔ=tiʔ ‘and so=INTS’, tɨt=tiʔ =ma ‘then’, and with the adverbial particle
hunhã=tiʔ ‘long.ago=INTS’.14) ʔĩ=ʔêw=na         hunhã=ti,           bêʔe=nit     hun=héʔ

3.2    Open classes
3.2.0 Introduction
        Nouns and verbs conform the two open classes of words in Kakua.
        The elements of the open word classes in Kakua have, in principle, an
unlimited membership. That is to say, the open classes of words in Kakua may
include not only native words, but also readily accept borrowings, calques, and any
other type of new lexical items such as words newly formed by semantic extensions
or by the lexicalization of formerly more complex words (e.g., historical compounds
that have undergone morphological and/or phonological fusion to form one complex
lexical item).
        The main element of the members of open classes is a noun or verb root that
heads the noun or verb phrase accordingly.
        Roots can be further divided into those that can occur as free elements and
those that are obligatorily bound with inflectional or derivational morphology
(Chapters 4 and 5 discuss the different free and obligatorily bound noun roots. Verb
are described in Chapters 8 and 9).
        In this study a free morpheme is understood as an element that is
phonologically independent, i.e. it is not obligatorily bound to another free
morpheme or to other bound morphology in order to form a full word.
        A major distinction between Kakua noun and verb roots concerns the
morphology each of these requires. Kakua nouns are formed by a free root that can
occur without the need of additional morphology. Verbs, on the other hand, require
for the most part a more complex morphology.
        The main semantic, phonological, syntactic and morphological characteristics
of Kakua nouns and verbs are described in the following subsections. Subsection
§3.2.1 describes these main characteristics that define Kakua nouns. §3.2.2 deals
with the main properties that characterize verbs.","[120, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125]"
"3.2.1 Nouns
       In Kakua, nouns are typically formed by a noun root which serves as the head
of the phrase (a detailed description of subclasses of nouns is given in Chapter 4).
       Semantically, prototypical Kakua nouns are lexical items denoting things,
places, names, animate and inanimate entities, abstract concepts such as thoughts and
104   A Grammar of Kakuafeelings, and various ecological elements. This semantic characterization of the noun
class complies with the typical typological characteristics of nouns (c.f. Givón 1979,
Hopper & Thompson 1984, Thompson 1988, Schachter & Shopen 2007, among
others). Examples of Kakua nouns are given in (19)-(20):19) nin tɨtʃi,     nin      Wacará
    this village this.M Wacará
    ‘In this village, here in Wacará’20) wěm          bík-wili=héʔ                       tul̂ iʔtɨ=diʔ         wã=tah-ap
    1SG           one-CL:fem=EMPH                      manioc=OBJ            1SG=plant-PST
    ‘I, alone, planted manioc’       Syntactically, nouns head noun phrases which can function as arguments of a
predicate; thus, nouns are typical hosts for the marking of case to indicate the
grammatical function of a head noun within a clause (see Chapter 6).
       Kakua is a predominantly verb-final language, thus, noun phrases tend to
precede the verb as illustrated in example in (21) below:                      Noun phrases                                           Verb
21) bɨ, nin    húptʃi=diʔ          wěm tul̂ iʔ-tɨ  wã=tah-ap=hĩ
    nowDEM year/summer=OBJ 1SG manioc-root 1SG=plant-PST=REM.PST
    ‘Now, in this year I have planted manioc indeed’       There is no exclusive phonological trait that distinguishes nouns from other
types of morphemes in Kakua.
       The morphology of nouns is far less complex than that of verbs.
Morphologically, and unlike verbs (see §3.2.2 below and Chapter 8 for the
description of the verb morphology and structure) 1, the vast majority of nouns roots
can occur on their own as free morphemes. Examples (22) and (23) below illustrate
nouns occurring as free morphemesː22) newě       ʔã=beh=na=ka
    man         3SG.M=go=DECL=ASS
    ‘the man goes away’23) ʔibǐ wɨbɨ              ʔã=tɨh-ɨ=na=ka       ʔã=ʧãhap
    uncle wild.turkey.hen 3SG.M=hunt-RED=DECL=ASS 3SG.M=PROG
    ‘uncle is hunting wild turkey hen’       1
           Verb roots occur on their own only under specific syntactic or discourse related conditions.
                                                 Types of morphemes and word classes                 105        Another morphological characteristic of nouns, as opposed to verbs, is that
the number of affixes that combine in individual noun forms are by far fewer than
those that combine with verbs. The maximum number of affixes that can be included
in a simple noun form is five derivational and/or inflectional suffixes. Additionally,
the Kakua noun template allows for only one proclitic, and a maximum of five
enclitics. Figure 2.1 below illustrates a simplified version of the noun template.
Obligatory elements are in bold (a detailed noun template is given in Chapter 4):Figure 3.1. Simplified noun template
       {PN=root(s)-suffix(es)=enclitics}       An example of a noun root and the morphology that attaches to it is given in

    3SG.F.POSS=manioc-circle-DIM-CL:round-PL=EMPH
    ‘her very own little manioc breads’       Nouns do not take prefixes. Prefixes are restricted to verbs. Unlike verbs,
nouns take affixes for number (25)-(26) and can be bound to shape classifiers (27):225) nɨ ̂w               nɨ ̂w-na
    leaf                leaf-PL.IN
    ‘leaf’              ‘leaves’26) bɨ ̌ƅʔ              bɨ ̌ƅʔ-wã

    ‘louse’             ‘lice’27) wɨ ̂-naʔ
    leg-CL:tree
    ‘leg’       Nouns can also be the result of the nominalization of verbs. Example in (28)
below illustrates de nominalization of verbs by attaching the nominalizer suffix -at.
Other nominalization suffixes and nominalization strategies are described in Chapter
5.28) hěmɁ-at     wiʔi-kan

             See chapter 4 for a description of nominalization of verbs when taking shape classifiers. See
chapter 5 for a description of classifiers in Kakua.
106   A Grammar of Kakua
       Only nouns can be possessed (alienable/inalienable possession. Possession is
described in Chapter 5). Example in (29) below illustrates possession on a
nominalized verb. Example (30) shows possession on a noun:29) fwit   fĩʔ=mɨ ̀n-at                                híʔhéʔ

    be.down.below-know-NEG=REM.PST 1SG             Colombia-POSS-mouth=OBJ
    ‘I did not know any Spanish’ (I didn’t know any Colombian mouth)       The strategy for negation in nouns differs from that of verbs in that verbal
negation is marked with the negation suffix -kan, while the negation of nouns is
expressed through existential negation,3 as in (31):31) kět webit wîʔi-kan          yegěʔ wîʔi-kan
    3PL child    not.exist-NEG    clothes not.exist-NEG
    ‘They don’t have children and don’t have clothes’       It is also an exclusive characteristic of nouns that they can be modified by
numerals, or take quantifiers. Additionally, numerals and quantifiers can themselves
function as head of noun phrases.
       Finally, noun compounding is a productive strategy in Kakua of derivation or
to express possessive relations. Noun compounding is described in Chapter 5.
       The following list summarizes the main properties of nouns in Kakua.
Properties summarized in (a)-(c) are exclusive to nouns; these properties also apply
to derived nouns, but the underived noun roots are most relevant for establishing the
difference between word classes. Properties summarized in (d) and (e) are properties
shared between nouns and verbs.a) Semantically: they refer to human beings, places, things, animate & inanimate
   entities, abstract notions
b) Syntactically: nouns function as heads of noun phrases. Noun phrases can
   function as arguments. Inflection for case occurs only on the noun phrase and
   on adjectives, and on verbs only when they are functioning a complements (see
   Chapter 13 on complement clauses).
c) Morphologicallyː there is a smaller repertoire of bound morphology that can
   combine with nouns than the repertoire of morphology that combines with verbs.
   The morphology of nouns includes the marking of number, shape and/or case.
   Nouns do not take prefixes.","[125, 126, 127, 128]"

locative case marker =bǔ and the object case marker =diʔ ‘OBJ’ (see Chapter 6).
Secondly, note that the adjunct precedes the verb. Additionally, note that the adjunct
occurs in between the two object arguments of the clause. This may be related to the
fact that there is no overt subject NP in this example. This example thus suggests
that Kakua prefers to place the adjunct preceding the verb, but not in clause-initial
position, adjuncts thus ending up in the second position within the clause. The
preferred ordering of constituents in clauses with adjuncts would then be as follows:
S[ADJUNCT]OV, or O[ADJUNCT]V, the second ordering being preferred whenever the
subject NP is absent.
       Examples (33)-(34) also show that all arguments functioning as objects are
marked by the morpheme =diʔ, regardless of their semantic roles. In other words,
object arguments in the semantic roles of patient (P), theme (T), goals/recipients (R),
are all encoded by the same morpheme. As described in Chapter 6, the order of
object noun phrases encoding T, P or R is also free. The alignment of object
arguments is thus neutral (as in Croft 2003; Haspelmath 2005; Dryer 2007;
Malchukov et. al 2010).","[333, 334]"
"
11.5 Summary
        The word order and alignment of arguments in Kakua can be summarized as
follows:
 Kakua shows a strong preference for the SOV ordering of its constituents.
     Alternative orders follow a preferentiality scale, from most preferred SOV to
     least preferred (but attested with restrictions) VOS.
 Most preferred orders are verb-final, with objects preceding the verb.
 The coding of subject arguments is of the head-marking type.
 Subject arguments are not morphologically marked for case.
 Kakua A arguments and S arguments are not different morphosyntactically. This
     conforms to a typical nominative-accusative type of alignment, where A and S
     arguments are equal, while different from P arguments: A=S≠P.
314    A Grammar of Kakua     The marking of object arguments is of the dependent-marking type. Nouns or
      NPs functioning as object arguments are marked by case with the case marker
      =diʔ.
     Differential Object Marking (DOM) criteria govern the overtness of
      morphological marking of object arguments.
     The object case marker =diʔ serves to mark NPs functioning as object
      arguments in several different semantic roles.
     The alignment of object arguments corresponds to a neutral type of object
      alignment, where P=T=R.

          Basic clause structure and types of clauses
12.0   Introduction
       This chapter describes the basic clause structure and the different clause types
in Kakua. Section §12.1 provides an introductory overview of the minimal
requirements to form a clause. Section §12.2 gives a description of copular
constructions involving predicative and existential copulas. In addition to affirmative
existential copulas, Kakua also has a negative existential copula; this type of negative
existential is described in §12.3. Section §12.4 gives a description of predicative
possession. This is followed by a description of comparative constructions in §12.5,
and non-verbal predicates expressing equation in §12.6. Finally, §12.7 provides a
description of the basic locative constructions.
       This chapter concludes with a description of Kakua clause types, presented in
4 subsections: declarative clauses in §12.9; interrogative clauses, both polar and
content interrogatives, in §12.10; imperative clauses in §12.11; and negative
imperative clauses in §12.12. Responses to imperative clauses are described in
§12.13, and a summary is found in §12.14.
12.1   Minimal clause
        A basic sentence in Kakua is composed of at least one independent clause.
An intransitive clause is minimally composed of a predicate (with optional
indexation of the subject by means of a cross-referencing proclitic), as in (1); or an
optional subject NP and a predicate, as in (2), where the subject NP typically
precedes the predicate (SV). Transitive clauses minimally contain a predicate;
additionally, transitive clauses typically contain an overt object NP (though not
obligatorily); the subject NP is optional, and it may be indexed on the predicate by
means of cross-referencing proclitics (3), which are themselves also optional (see
Chapter 11 for description of criteria governing the occurrence of proclitics). In
transitive clauses, the object NP typically precedes the predicate of the clause (SOV)
(4)-(6).                   ̃̌ ʔ=hĩ

12.2     The affirmative existential copular verb hɨm
        The affirmative existential verb hɨm is used in predicative and existential
copular constructions to encode existence, and also permanent states and attribution,
as discussed in this section. Equative constructions in Kakua use a different strategy,
and are formed by the juxtaposition of the NPs without the use of the existential verb
hɨm (see §12.6 below). Note that the verb hɨm ‘exist’, which is referred to as a copula
here, can function as a predicate on its own, whereas the canonical definition of
copulas expects copulas to not be able to function as predicates on their own right;
see Hengeveld (1992). Examples below illustrate copula constructions in Kakua,
using the existential verb hɨm ‘exist’ in its different functions to express permanent
states, existence/location, and attribution:7) jeděʔ-wã    jěb    hɨm=nit

Kakua does not differ from that shown for other types of verbal constructions
(intransitive, monotransitive, ditransitive), in which the verb is (preferably) in final
position, being preceded by the object and the subject/agent arguments: SOV( cop).
Thus, a copular construction is also preferably of the type SOV. The copular verb in
Kakua takes all of the verbal morphology (see Chapter 8 for a discussion of verbal
morphology). This include interrogative mood (14) and tense and aspect (14)-(17)
(see also the examples above in this section), cross-referencing proclitics,
morphemes indicating evidentiality, as in (16), and nominalizers, as in (17):

318      A Grammar of Kakua12.3     The negative existential verb wîʔikan
        In addition to the affirmative existential copular verb hɨm, Kakua has an
inherently negative stative verb wîʔikan denoting the meanings of ‘not to have or not
to exist’. This form can be further analyzed into two morphemes, a verb root wîʔi-
and the verbal negation suffix –kan. However, the root wîʔi- is obligatorily bound
and cannot occur without the negation suffix –kan, and this verb is thus considered
to be a single negative existential expression. The negative existential verb, like other
Kakua verbs, takes all the verbal morphology available to verbs in general: cross-
referencing proclitics (18); TAM affixes (18)-(20), evidentiality prefixes and/or
enclitics (as in (18)-(20)), and derivational suffixes to form adjectives (21):18) hiw=bɨt                  ʔã=t-wîʔikan=na

existential wîʔikan, when the predicative or existential clause is negative. Negating

6.2         Object case =diʔ
6.2.0 Introduction
            Arguments functioning as objects are in principle marked with the case clitic
=diʔ ‘OBJ’. The object case marker may be omitted under specific semantic and
discourse conditions, which determine differential object marking in Kakua. These
criteria are described in section §0. Arguments marked with =diʔ ‘OBJ’ can express
several different semantic roles such as patients, recipients, beneficiaries,
maleficiaries and other affected roles. This also implies that the two objects of
ditransitive predicates are not differentiated in terms of case marking, all are marked
with the case marker =diʔ ‘OBJ’. The following sections give a set of examples
illustrating the different semantic roles that can be expressed by the object marker
=diʔ. Subsection (§6.2.2) presents object marking on prototypical patients and
themes. Section §6.2.3 presents object marking on prototypical recipients,
beneficiaries and maleficiaries.",[210]

10.6.2 Nonvisual evidentiality
        Nonvisual evidentiality in Kakua is a category which indicates that the
situation was experienced by the speaker on a firsthand basis through sensorial means
other than visual. Nonvisual sensorial means include those of smelling, hearing,
tasting, or feeling through the skin. As opposed to the reported category, which refers
to a situation in which a speech report concerning the event was heard, ‘hearing’ in
the nonvisual category implies that the speaker directly heard the situation taking
place. To indicate nonvisual evidentiality, the prefix ĩ- is used (as shown in (87)
above), and it is glossed here as ‘NON.VIS’. This form does not occur very often in
my data.13 It was given to me especially in elicitation sessions, but in texts of
conversations, narratives, etc., its occurrence is very limited. Some examples are
presented below in (88) and (89) from natural text, and in (90) from elicitation:88) dêpaʔ            wã=ʧãh-bip           waj        paʔ

      EMPH         hole-DIM           3SG.M=NON.VIS-exist-PST=REM.PST

      was a hole (on the other side)’             ̌ ʔ=na=ka
90) ʔã=ĩ-hɨw
    3SG.M=NON.VIS-come=DECL=ASS
    ‘he is coming’ (His noise gives him away, the speaker can hear him coming)
         13
            Perhaps an evaluation of the different speech genres or speech situations, such as conversations,
narratives, etc, and their interaction with different tenses, can give a clearer picture regarding the use of
this evidential marker.
                                                Tense, aspect, mood and evidentiality            297        One’s own personal states, such as feelings, or thoughts, however, are not
marked with this nonvisual evidential prefix. Instead, the unmarked form (visual) is
used. This seems to be the opposite of the common prediction of the nonvisual
category in some of the Vaupés languages (see for example Ramirez 1997 for
Tukano, Epps 2008 for Hup).
        As the examples above show, the use of this nonvisual evidential is not
restricted to the first person, as it can refer to situations being performed by a third
person (as in (87) and (90) above). In these examples the event is being undertaken
by a third person, but the evidential indicates that the speaker is basing her
knowledge of the situation on her own sensorial experience of the situation taking
place, that is, the speaker hears the event taking place and presents it as such, though
the event is not being carried out by the speaker herself.
        In some languages with evidentiality systems, the nonvisual evidential is
derived from verbs of perception such as ‘hear’, or ‘see’ (c.f., Aikhenvald
2004:174f). The nonvisual evidential marker in Kakua does not have a clear
etymological source, either within Kakua or in Nɨkak. In Nɨkak no such category has
been reported, nor are there verbs in Kakua meaning ‘see’ or ‘hear’ that could be
related to Kakua ĩ-, in the data that I have gathered for Kakua.
        Finally, it is also important to note that a nonvisual category encoding
information which was directly experienced by the speaker (by sensorial means
different from visual), has been described for many languages of the Vaupés area
(c.f., Barnes 1990 for Tuyuca, Ramirez 1997 for Tukano, Aikhenvald 2003, 2004 for
Tariana; Epps 2008 for Hup among others). This brings up the possibility that the
nonvisual evidential prefix in Kakua might reflect an areal feature. If there is a
correlation of the nonvisual evidential in Kakua with those of its neighboring
languages, I propose that it is likely that the prefix was already in the language before
Kakua came in contact with Tukanoan languages. Perhaps the prefix had a different
meaning, but in any case I am more inclined to think that the form itself is unlikely
to be to a borrowing. I propose this for two reasons:     i)         on the one hand, the few (identifiable) morphological borrowings in
                Kakua (with the exception of the terminative preposition pɨ ‘TERM’, see
                Chapter 12), correspond to forms that occur after the stem, primarily
                because most of the languages spoken in the Vaupés area do not have
                prefixing positions;14 thus, if the nonvisual prefix in Kakua were to
                correspond to a borrowing from a neighboring language, it would be
                somehow strange to adopt it as a prefix in Kakua, instead of as a post-
                stem form if it came from a suffix. If it came from a prefix, it would
                be easily identifiable from the source language.
     ii)        Kakua has a limited number of prefixes, and at least one of them (the
                habitual marker) can be said to be a form inherited from proto Kakua-          Gómez-Imbert, in personal communication, mentioned that Barasana (ET), for example has
           14some prefixing positions. It is not, however, a widespread pattern of languages spoken in the Vaupés,
which are mainly suffixing languages.
298   A Grammar of Kakua             Nɨkakan. It will be difficult to strongly support an argument in which,
             instead of considering prefixing forms as a shared feature in the proto-
             language, these prefixing forms in Kakua were to be considered an
             innovation entering Kakua through contact with neighboring Vaupés
             languages, when what has been noted mostly is that Kakua has
             borrowed quite a few suffixing or post-stem forms.","[317, 318, 319]"

from the parakeet clan ‘jeděʔ-wã ’ who was taken by the late uncle of the speaker:40) jeděʔ-wã-wili=diʔ            ʔã=ta-hɨjbi                 fwĩ=ʔibi-bâʔdaʔ

    ‘Our late uncle took the dʒeděʔwã clan woman’       Obligatory object marking extends to objects with the semantic role of goal
and source, when these refer to places of human settlements (41). In this example
the proper nouns Wacará and Wacurabá , two indigenous villages in the Vaupés, are
object marked with =diʔ indicating their function as object arguments.","[217, 218, 219]"
"4.3.1 The v(stem)-at nominalization
       Deriving nouns from verb stems is generally done in Kakua by attaching the
nominalizer suffix -at to a verb stem (verb-at). This nominalizer suffix is
polysemous, and its different nominalization meanings are: object nominalization,
instrument nominalization, and locative nominalization, which can be characterized,
following Comrie & Thompson (2007:338-342), as:        a) Objective nominalization: nouns designating the result or the typical or
           ‘cognate’ object of an action.
        b) Instrumental nominalization: ‘an instrument for VERBing’.
        c) Locative nominalization: ‘a place where VERB happens’.a)    Objective nominalizations in Kakua are illustrated in (46)-(48) below:46) tʃewʔ                         ‘to cough’            VERB
      tʃewʔ-at                    ‘cough’               NOUN47) pàʔ                          ‘have fever’          VERB

      tʃaǩ -at                   ‘bite’                NOUNb) Instrumental nominalizations in Kakua are illustrated in (49)-(50) below:49) tʃɨd                          ‘to sit’              VERB
      tʃɨd-at                     ‘chair’               NOUN (for the purpose of sitting)4
        4
            Note that this example can also be interpreted as a locative nominalization.

     people-make/do-float-NMLZ
    ‘the place where people are born’       Once a verb has been nominalized, it can take prototypical noun morphology
such as number marking as in (52)-(53):52) ʔĩ=hěmɁ-at-na
    3PL=eat-NMLZ-PL
    ‘their foods’53) ʧɨ ̃̂d-at-pâʔaʔ-na
    sit-NMLZ-CL:cover-PL
    ‘chairs’       It can also take case markers, as in (54)-(55) where the nominalized verb
stems (v-at) are marked with the object case clitic =diʔ: Note that in example (54)
the nominalized verb is part of a compound. Note also that the nominalization jâp-
at (pass-NMLZ) ‘tip’ is not semantically transparent.54) patiera=na        hɨjbi=na                         jêgeʔ-waj-at=diʔ

    ‘(I) broke the tip of his tail’
4.3.2 The v(stem)-ni nominalization: agentive nominalization
        Agentive nominalization is achieved by adding the suffix -ni to a verb stem.
The resulting noun refers to an (animate) entity that can be characterized as a
frequent doer of an action, i.e., ‘one who VERBs’.
        Note that the suffix -ni has a number of other functions. Besides deriving
agentive nouns from verbs, it can also derive adjectives from descriptive verbs, as
illustrated further below. Examples (56)-(59) below illustrate the derivation of
agentive nouns from verbs in Kakua:
140      A Grammar of Kakua56) hîguʔ-                ‘to appear/ reveal/ show up’
      hîguʔ-ni            ‘ghost’57) kûʔu-                ‘give medicine’
      kûʔu-ni            ‘doctor’ (compare with ‘medicine’ below)
      kûʔu-at            ‘medicine’      ̀
58) Ɂɨw-                  ‘sleep’
        ̀
      Ɂɨw-ni              ‘sleeper’ (one who sleeps frequently)59) keh-mâw-ni           ‘fisher’
    fish-kill-A.NMLZ       As mentioned above, when the suffix -ni attaches to a descriptive verb, it
derives adjectives (and is glossed as ADJVZ), as illustrated in (60) below (a
description of adjectives and qualitative meanings in Kakua is given in Chapter 3
and further illustrated in Chapter 8):60) měm        ma=tɨj-ni                   jêwháp=diʔ
    2SG         2SG=be.good-ADJVZ           day=OBJ
    ‘the day you are well (good)’
4.3.3 The v(stem)-classifier nominalization: instrument nominalization (and others)
        Another way of forming instrument nominalizations in Kakua is by attaching
a noun classifier to a verb stem. This strategy emphasizes the shape of the referent
of the derived noun, often encoding a meaning of ‘an instrument for VERBING’.
        Examples (61)-(62) illustrate the verb-classifier nominalization strategy in
Kakua:
61) haȟ                   ‘slide.on.water’
      haȟ -tʃû           ‘boat’ (lit. the cover thing for sliding on water)
      slide.on.water-CL:cover62) tʃaǩ                 ‘bite’
      tʃaǩ -daʔ          ‘axe’ (lit. the round thing for biting)
      bite-CL:round       While classifiers can act as nominalizers on their own, attaching a classifier
is far more common with verb stems that have already been nominalized with the
nominalizer suffix -at, as illustrated in examples (63)-(67) below:
                                          The noun: morphology and structure       14163) têw-at-daʔ
    play-NMLZ-CL:round
    ‘ball’ (lit. round one for playing)64) hěmʔ-at-daʔ
    eat-NMLZ-CL:round
    ‘fruit’ (lit. round one for eating)65) hǐ-at-kit
    light.up-NMLZ-CL:log
    ‘lantern’66) a. dǎk-at-dubʔ
       write-NMLZ-CL:pointed
       ‘pencil’     b. dǎk-at-tuli
         write-NMLZ-CL:layers
         ‘book’          It is important to note that classifiers in Kakua are almost exclusively used
with nouns or verbs that are nominalized (through the nominalization process of
adding the nominalizer suffix -at or the agent nominalizer -ni). Exceptions to this
were shown in examples (61)-(62) above (which do not require the nominalizer
suffix -at). A case related to this is given in example, (67), where a noun is derived
from a verb by the addition of nɨw ‘leaf’, which is a noun in Kakua, but resembles
classifiers in its semantics as well as its use as nominalizer in this example.67) a. dâdaʔ-nɨw
       to.reflect-leaf
       ‘photo’     b. dâdaʔ-nɨw         ʔɨbʔ-at-daʔ
         to.reflect-leaf take.out-NMLZ-CL:round
         ‘photo camera’        It would be also possible to analyze nɨw ‘leaf’ in the example above as a
classifier instead of as a noun. This is consistent with other languages of the area,
where ‘leaf’ is commonly expressed with a classifier, and has developed extended
meanings of, e.g., ‘paper’, ‘book’. In Kakua, ‘leaf’ has extended also to mean ‘paper’,
though usually the Spanish borrowing papelaɁ is used.
        Analyzing ‘leaf’ as a noun contrasts with v-classifier type of nominalization
(without additional nominalizing morphology) that has been described as a typical
nominalization strategy in many Eastern Tukanoan languages (neighboring groups
of Kakua), like the following examples from Wanano (68) and Desano (69):
142         A Grammar of KakuaWanano: (Stenzel 2004):68) hoa-dʉ
    write-CL:cylindrical/straight
    ‘a pen’Desano: (Silva 2012):69) baya-wi
    dance-CL:house
    ‘a house of dance’
4.3.4 The v-v nominalization
       Finally, the least productive type of nominalization in Kakua is v-v verb
compounding. Being non-productive, these units are presumably perceived as fixed
units by speakers, more like a lexical nouns, rather than a combination of verbs, also
because the resulting meaning is often not transparently related to the meaning of
the contained verb stems. An example of this type of lexical nouns from v-v
compounding is given in (70) below, and only a few more of these are found
throughout the corpus of Kakua grammar: 570) kâmaʔ-ʔǎb
    be.cold-go.up
    ‘shadow’
        5
            Another form that speakers also indicated as an alternate meaning for shadow is dâdaʔ-at
to.reflect-NMLZ. However, most accepted the one in (70) as a more accurate translation of shadow.

        To summarize the four types of nominalization strategies in Kakua, Table 4.2
below provides a list of the characteristics of each of the nominalization forms
illustrated in §4.3.1-§4.3.4 above in this section.","[160, 161, 162, 163, 164, 165]"

     For the Kakua people,
        and those who left.
Y para mi papi y mami, que
       permanezca lo bello.
       Acknowledgments
         After the many years it took me to sew this grammar together, I couldn’t
possibly come up with a fair list of all the people who helped me on my way.
Completing a dissertation is not only a writing process, but also an emotional ride
of happiness, excitement and despair.
         First, I owe the most heartfelt gratitude to the Kakua people, who allowed for
me to meet them back in 2008, and who later became a group of friends, a family,
taking care of me during the long walks in the inhospitable forest. With patience
they taught me the simplest, most beautiful appreciation for the sublime things and
beings in life. I thank those Kakua ‘who left’ to the forest and did not return, who
left life and kept on going, who passed away and are deeply missed. I especially
want to thank the women of Wacará for their power, for lovingly taking care of me,
and for showing me the formidable force of female wisdom. No acknowledgments
section is long enough, and no language is fair enough to express my gratitude for
the Kakua people.
         I greatly thank my supervisors who had to struggle along with my own
difficulties and periods of being stuck with a single problem, periods that seemed
like a string of eternities. At times I was filled with motivation, but at many others
it felt as if I was only being dragged through to barely make it to an end, or even a
starting, point. Some other times, I was delivering only because I couldn’t bare the
embarrassment of not keeping up with all of the support that seemed to have been
earned without fair merit from my end. I owe my gratitude to Frank Seifart who had
to face the worst effects of frustration, and who had made many sacrifices to walk
along with me and make this dissertation possible; I’m sure that I am still unaware
of many of his sacrifices. Kees Hengeveld always intervened with warm enthusiasm,
and he always offered emotional motivation that transcended beyond the dissertation
itself. Finally, I blame Pattie Epps more than anyone for both the beginning and the
end of this project. It was she who first encouraged me to undertake the
documentation and description of Kakua, and through the inspiration that she spreads
with her passion and endless motivation, even at the least promising times, I kept on
enjoying the ride of building the puzzle that the grammar of Kakua represents to me,
always positively affected by Pattie’s fascination for the project as if it was herself
going through every second of the time it took me to understand Kakua. Thank you
also for warmly taking care of me, personally and academically.
         At the University of Texas at Austin, where I spent my first years of academic
training in linguistics, I also splash some of the blame onto Nora England, who would
unconditionally offer me support, care and force, filling me with the confidence to
face the best parts and the nasty bits of these past years.
         Also at UT Austin, my professors and fellow students provided me with an
inspirational academic environment from which this grammar has greatly benefited.
         My friends Ana Paula Brandão, Telma Can, and Thiago Vital were the
familiar and loving support that only friends can offer when home is far away.
        The department of linguistics at the Max Planck Institute in Leipzig stepped
in in 2012 to offer an unbeatable setting for academic development. I thank my
colleagues there for the academic inspiration towards a growth in the fascination for
science.
        My time in Leipzig was filled with colors and love from my friends Iren
Hartmann and Diana Schackow, reaffirming and redefining the meaning of
friendship and family beyond what I have ever experienced: Diana, motivated by
such caring love that she even suffered an uncomfortable train ride to come to my
rescue, and Iren, guiding me out of the darkest places with her strength, compassion
and love. Not only did both my friends provide me with important doses of much
needed alcohol and food, but also left a permanent impression of inspiration and of
strong loving women in academics, as well as friends and family. May life continue
to bring us together, and keep both of you as beautiful, strong and loving as the
women as you are.
        Also in Leipzig, Heriberto Avelino made sure of my emotional wellbeing,
and while he wasn’t exactly a model of decency (more of moral decay and chocolate
overdoses), I hold him deep in my heart for his friendship and love.
        In the world in general I have always run into Martin Kohlberger and always
will, and since I’m such a superstitious person I rapidly learnt that it meant he was
going to be that big part of my heart. I gave in and I couldn’t have had better times
and better laughs. Even during the most obscure times I would always be cheered by
the joy and love that he spreads. Thank you for helping me getting through the rough
unpaved parts of these past years. This grammar is silently infested with your
greatness.
        I thank Sasha Aikhenvald for the time in Cairns and the enthusiasm towards
the completion of this dissertation, and for her comments in some chapters of this
grammar. I also thank Kasia Wojtylak for every warm word and every smile.
        In Cairns I also had the emotional and pharmacological-caffeinated support
and friendship of Nick Piper, whose mere voice and presence was already a
motivation for happiness, not to mention our shared embarrassing TV preferences.
        Natacha Chevrier, for sharing the endless cold nights in Leiden, and always
offering an alternative in case of the apocalypse: ‘an incomplete grammar of Kakua’.
        I also thank the academic panel who revised this grammar for their insights
and stimulating comments.
        En Colombia, a mis amigos que me llenaban de fuerza silenciosa para seguir
trabajando. Saber que regresaba a verlos siempre era un aliciente para los días de
desespero y de ausencias. Federico Viadero, Daniel Castro, Mauricio Concha, Sharay
Cruz, Camilia Gómez Cotta, Madelaynne Montaño, Claudia Andrade, Pilar Blanco.
        Finalmente gracias a mi familia. A mis hermanos Soraya y Vladimir, por el
amor que es lo que hace hermosa la vida. A mis padres, de quienes lo recibí todo, y
que vivieron con fuerza las alegrías de esta aventura Kakua, y me ayudaron a llevar
el peso de las angustias y frustraciones. Solo ustedes saben lo que pasa más allá del
corazón y la mente, cuando la fuerza no es suficiente. Este trabajo es solo parte del
reflejo del inmenso amor, porque sin ese amor, confianza y cuidado, no podría haber
tomado el primer paso.

                    Introduction: Kakua and its speakers
1.0    Introduction
        Kakua is an Amazonian language spoken in the linguistic area of the Vaupés,
in Northwest Amazonia, eastern Colombia (the Ethnologue/ISO 639-3 code for
Kakua is cbv; the WALS code is cac).
        The language is a member of the small Kakua-Nɨkak language family.1 Its
speakers live in inland forest settlements. Two main settlements are home to most of
Kakua’s approximately 250 speakers. The largest of these two settlements is
Wacará2, with 183 individuals.3 Wacará is located between the Vaupés and the
Querarí Rivers in Colombian territory approximately 100 kilometers to the east of
Mitú, near the Brazilian border (see Map 1 below).
        The second bigger Kakua settlement is Nuevo Pueblo, which is an inland
forest village between the Vaupés and the Papurí rivers. The number of inhabitants
of this village is approximately 40 ~ 45 individuals.
        About 10-15 other speakers of Kakua live scattered either in villages inhabited
by speakers of Eastern Tukanoan languages (a neighboring language family), or on
their own in remote interfluvial settlements.
        The present work undertakes a grammatical description of the Kakua
language. The description is based mainly on dialects spoken in the Kakua village
of Wacará. Kakua is divided into two main dialect areas (see §1.6 below), in each of
these areas, there are some clan-specific varieties.","[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23]"
"
12.4     Predicative possession constructions
       Kakua has two main strategies to express possession. Firstly, the juxtaposition
of the possessor and the possessed NPs, with the possessive marker -ǐʔ suffixed to
the possessor NP for alienable possession, and without the possessive marker for
inalienable possession (see Chapter 5). Secondly, possession can be expressed by
means of a predicative construction (i.e. predicative possession). Predicative
possessive constructions involve the stative possessive verb bibùʔ ‘have/possess’.
The constituent order in predicative possessive constructions is consistent with
Kakua’s preferred SOV order. Thus, the possessor, most often animate, precedes the
possessed NP (usually inanimate), and the verb is at the end of the construction.
Constructions using this verb are illustrated in examples (23)-(26) below:23) badʔdaʔ         telu-ʧaʔ                    bɨdǐ
    deceased        quiver-CL:container         be.big       ʔĩ=t-bibùʔ=hip=tagǎ
       3PL=EVID-have=DUB=INF.EVID

       3SG.M=EVID-have-PST=REP.EVID=REM.PST
       ‘he had his very strong curare poison’25) fwǐt fĩɁ=mɨ ̃̌                  fĩ=bibùʔ=na=ka
    1PL 1PL.POSS=house                1PL=have=DECL=ASS
    ‘we have our house’26) webit         hũptʃi ʔã=bibùʔ=na=ka
    child         cold     3SG.M=have=DECL=ASS
    ‘the child has a cold’       As seen in the examples above, the predicative possessive verb ‘have’ bibùʔ
takes the common verbal morphology (e.g., subject cross-reference proclitics, tense,
aspect, mood, evidentiality). The possessed NP of a predicative possessive
construction is not case marked, even when DOM criteria apply (see Chapter 6).
320    A Grammar of Kakua12.5   Comparative constructions
        The function of comparative constructions in Kakua is to assign the relative
position of two referents on a predicative scale. Comparative constructions,
according to the terminology used in Stassen (1985), involve the following elements:
the standard of comparison (the NP indicating the object that serves as the yardstick
of the comparison); the comparee (the object that is being compared); the parameter
(the property on which the comparison is based), and the index (referring to the type
of comparison). The last two, i.e. the parameter and the index, are referred to as the
scale.
        Kakua comparative constructions include those in which the scale of
comparison expresses standards referred to as being less than, more than, and equal
to the compared entity. In these types of constructions, the scale is expressed by verb
roots, without additional TAME morphology, affixes or proclitics. In these cases, the
verb root by itself indicates the scale of comparison. Examples (27)-(29) illustrate
the use of the verb tʃaʔ ‘be.on.top’ not functioning as a predicate, but as a scale for
comparison. The order of constituents in comparative constructions is as follows: the
comparee precedes the standard, and the position of the scale of comparison (e.g.,
tʃaʔ ‘be.on.top’) is free.27) newě=bǔ jad-wili             tʃaʔ               hap=bǔ=ka

    3SG.M be.on.top         flea     be.bad-be.ugly=DECL       be/exist=ADJV=ASS
    ‘he is uglier than a flea’       Example (30) involves the use of the verb nɨmʔ ‘be.below’ as a scale for
comparison meaning ‘be less than’. Note that in these examples, as in (27)-(29) above
and (30) below, the verb expressing the scale for comparison does not take additional
TAM affixes and its function within the clause is not that of a predicate, but of a
scale of comparison:

    ‘like this short, the younger brother was shorter (than the older ones), just like
    Chavela’        Semblative comparison, in which the standard and the comparee are
conceived to be of equal degree on a given scale, are formed by using different
particles encoding meanings such as ‘be alike’, ‘like this’, ‘and so like this’, ‘be
equal’, ‘be similar to’. Choosing one particle or another depends primarily on
whether or not the speaker can physically signal the relative dimension of the
standard of comparison, and on the physical proximity of the speaker to the standard
of comparison. For example, if the speaker points to a tree in the distance as the
yardstick for comparison of height, then the particle paniʔna ‘and so like this’ (or its
shortened allomorph panʔ) would be used. This particle is also used whenever the
standard of comparison is not visually accessible. If instead the speaker physically
touches the yardstick of comparison, or uses gestures to indicate its dimensions, then
most often the particle mɨn ‘be equal’ is used.
        Example (30) above, highlights the use of particles mɨn ‘be equal’, and paʔniʔ
‘be alike/be like this’. During the utterance of the first line in the example, the
speaker was indicating how short the younger brother is with a hand gesture, by
placing one hand below with the palm of the hand facing upwards, and the other
hand higher up with its palm facing downwards. In this case the speaker uses the
particle mɨn ‘be equal’. Then, the speaker pointed at Chavela (a young girl listening
to the conversation), expressing that ‘the younger brother’ in the tale was about her
size; for this comparison the speaker uses the particle paʔniʔ ‘be alike/be like this’.
        Additional examples of semblative comparatison are given in (31)-(33) below.
A further description of Kakua’s particles, including the ones occurring within
comparative constructions, can be found in Chapter 3.31) kun=bǔ                 mɨnʔ=tiʔ      nin

          grandfather=INTS
          ‘yes, he was just like grandfather’        The superlative, describing a situation in which the comparee has the highest
degree among the standards of comparison, is expressed by using the noun niʔat
‘all/everything’, as in (34), or by using an emphasizing construction, as in (35),
where the nominalized verb jǔb ‘be true’ serves to express that the referent of the
noun keh ‘fish’ is the biggest among the referents of the standard of comparison
noun bita ‘others’. These examples additionally illustrate that the noun phrase
expressing the standard can be case-marked. Maybe this indicates that the standard
is regarded as a syntactic object. There is no explanation why it is that sometimes
comparees are object marked while other times they are not (the animacy hierarchy
governing DOM does not seem to predict object marking in these cases).34) newě        niʔat=diʔ          tʃaʔ               hap=bǔ

12.6    Non-verbal predicates
        Non-verbal predicates occur in verbless clauses that are formed by the
juxtaposition of two NPs without a verb. The subject argument always occurs clause-
initially in this type of clauses. Verbless clauses are used to express equative
relations, including identity, class inclusion, and class membership. Examples in
(36)-(39) below illustrate verbless clauses:36) kǎn          fwĩʔ=wâw-daʔ
    3SG.M         1PL.POSS=head-CL:round

          1SG=pass-PST-FUT
          ‘I am going to pass to you the ancient songs, now that you are a man,’       Note that an alternative analysis of these constructions may seem to be that
the copula has been omitted, i.e. as ‘zero copula’ construction. According to the
standard definition of copula constructions (Hengeveld 1992, Pustet 2003, and
especially Stassen 1994), a ‘zero copula’ type of construction presupposes that there
is a syntactic slot that is otherwise filled by another element, or in which a copula
occurs optionally under certain grammatical criteria. The examples shown in this
subsection, however, are not considered here as copula constructions with a zero
copula, because it is not the case that in these constructions a syntactic slot remains
empty in a restricted context, while alternating with an overt copula in some other
contexts. The examples presented in this section do not have alternatives with an
overt copula.
       Additionally, the simple juxtaposition of related elements in Kakua is a very
common strategy to express many different types of relations (e.g., derivation of
nouns Chapter 5, possession Chapter 5, coordination of clauses Chapter 13). It should
not be surprising then that expressing these more ‘permanent’ states of being (as
opposed to the less permanent states of being illustrated in the examples in section
§12.2) also appeal to the juxtaposition of elements as a way to express these more
permanent states of being.","[340, 341, 342, 343, 344]"

5.2    Noun classification and classifiers
5.2.1 Amazonian nominal classification systems
        Noun classes and classifiers are recognized as two separate phenomena in the
typology of nominal classification systems. Noun class systems are characterized as
systems with a small set of typically bound morphemes that are used for agreement
marking on various elements in a clause (Dixon 1986; Grinevald [Craig] 1986,
2000). Classifiers, on the other hand, are (usually free) forms that are not used as
agreement markers and that display a large set of members (cf. Allan 1977; Senft
2000, 2007; Croft 1994).
        Grinevald & Seifart (2004, see also Seifart & Payne 2007, Seifart 2007,
Seifart 2010a) argue that a strict division between noun classes and classifier systems
makes it difficult to account for the properties of nominal classification systems in
Amazonian languages.
        Instead, Grinevald & Seifart (2004) suggest that both defining properties
formerly given to the two separate systems (noun class vs. classifiers) converge in
one and the same system in some Amazonian languages. Seifart & Payne (2007:385)
suggest that possibly these nominal classification systems developed via
grammaticalization from nouns into both classifiers and agreement markers, given
that these systems display both agreement and boundedness.
        Nominal classification in Kakua shares characteristics of Amazonian systems
identified by Seifart & Payne (2007) as typical for Northwest Amazonia, namely
properties typical of a noun class system (bound suffixes, some marginal
anaphoric/agreement functions), as well as properties typical of a classifier system
(large set of forms with derivational functions specifying shape, texture or gender).
For the sake of a consistent terminology, though recognizing that the classification
of nouns in Kakua converge defining properties of noun classes and classifiers, in
this chapter I refer to the nominal classification system in Kakua as “classifiers” and
gloss them throughout as ‘CL’.
        The following sections provide a definition of classifiers in Kakua and the set
of thus identified classifiers (§5.2.2), a discussion of the derivational use of classifiers
148     A Grammar of Kakuaand similarities between classifier constructions and noun compounding (§5.2.3), and
the anaphoric use of classifiers (§5.2.4.)
5.2.2 Kakua classifiers as a subclass of nouns
        Morphosyntactically, classifiers in Kakua are a subclass of nouns. Like nouns,
they can often stand on their own (see for example (11) below). However, they are
identified here as a separate subset of nouns because, unlike regular nouns, they have
particular functions, semantic profiles, and forms that sets them apart from the rest
of nouns. These are listed below:
        i)       Functions: the subclass of nouns identified as classifiers, has two
                 main functions:
                    a) Derivation (§5.2.4)
                    b) Anaphoric reference (§5.2.5)
        ii)      Semantic profile: semantically, this subclass of nouns has a
                 distinctive profile, which can be divided into three groups: gender
                 specification (§5.2.6), shape (§5.2.7), and texture (§5.2.8).
        iii)     Form: often these classifier nouns have forms that are shorter than
                 lexical nouns, or seem to be a reduced form of a noun or verb. In
                 addition, unlike the rest of the majority of nouns, some of the
                 classifiers appear to be toneless. 1 When not bound, the set of noun
                 classifiers can function either for anaphoric reference to an NP or as
                 a modifier of an NP.
        Note that in combination with other nouns, classifiers are represented as
bound forms in the transcriptions. They are referred to as “suffixed” elements
whenever they occur attached to a preceding noun. The reason to identify them as
“attached” elements, rather than juxtaposed nouns, is that when classifiers occur
attached to a preceding noun, they form one single phonological word with that noun.
Note that a classifier can also attach to a complex noun stem, after, e.g. plural
suffixes, and not directly to the noun root.
        Another motivation to call this subclass of nouns classifiers is because of their
typical use and semantics, which are overall very similar to classifier systems
described for surrounding languages in the Vaupés area and beyond.
        It is difficult to draw a line between constructions involving classifiers
attached to nouns versus compounds consisting of two nouns. This point can be
particularly well illustrated with terms referring to parts of plants, where there is not
        1
            Phonetically, the forms which appear to be toneless, adapt to the melody of the morpheme to
which they attach. For example, if they are attached to a morpheme with a falling tone, then the classifier
will be pronounced with a low tone by copying the last portion of the falling tone contour from the
preceding morpheme. When no tone precedes it (e.g., when attached to other toneless noun morphology
like plural marking, or when standing on their own), these toneless classifiers are pronounced with a low
tone.
                       Noun compounding, noun classification and possession 149a clear distinction between analyzing this type of construction as N-classifier
constructions or as N-N compounding. The analysis can go either way. This is
illustrated in the following examples, where what is glossed as classifiers may as
well be analyzed as nouns in compounds:10) a.      mâ-nat                      ‘root’ (tree-CL:root)
    b.      mɨ ̀-naʔ-daʔ                 ‘peach-palm fruit’(tree-CLːtree-CL:round)
    c.      wɨbʔ-kãw                    ‘stalk of patabá palmtree’ (patabá.tree-stalk)
    d.      dâwa-nɨ ̂w-na               ‘leaves of rubber tree’ (rubber.tree-leaf-PL)
    e.      mâ-pɨh                      ‘base of tree’ (tree-base.of.tree)
    f.      mâ-kãw                     ‘stalk’ (tree-stalk)
    g.      mâ-kãʔ                     ‘branch’ (tree-branch)        When classifiers are used anaphorically, they also function
morphosyntactically like nouns, and take e.g. case markers or number marking
(showing again that they are morphosyntactically a subclass of nouns). This is
illustrated in (11) below, where the referent of the noun ʔɨ ̂ʔ-naʔ blowgun-CL:tree
‘blowgun’ in the first line of the example, is anaphorically referred back to in the
second line lacking the head noun, and instead the classifier stands on its own taking
all of the nominal morphology: naʔ=hiʔ̃́ CL:tree=COM ‘with the stick like object’:11) nɨwá           ʔã=peb-hɨm=nit=hiʔ̃́                            ʔɨ ̂ʔ-naʔ

     hummingbird=OBJ            kill
     ‘the children hunt hummingbirds with the blowgun the grandfather had stolen
     from his neighbours’       Example (12) below illustrates the Kakua classifier -puku ‘CL:convex’
occurring as a free form, as well as two other classifiers that occur with a possessive
prefix only, just like noun stems. This example is particularly relevant to the question
raised above, regarding the unclear distinction between classifiers or nouns in
general. E.g., the forms in example (12) can alternatively be understood as a free
nouns, rather than as classifiers:12) pukuʔ                 ʔã=daʔ-naʔ
    CL:convex            3SG.M=CL:round-CL:tree
    ‘a tree with nodes along its trunk’ (the convex one, has nodes)
150    A Grammar of Kakua5.2.3 The inventory of classifiers
        The inventory of Kakua classifiers comprises a rather small set of forms, if
compared to that found in other languages of the Vaupés linguistic area (especially
that described for Arawak Tariana (Aikhenvald 2003), which displays a long list of
classifiers for shape, function, quantification, and other meanings that Aikhenvald
(2003:87ff) calls specific classifiers. Also, Gómez-Imbert (1996) describes a large
set of shape classifiers found in Tukanoan languages, most of which have semantics
relating to the form or shape of the noun referent to which they are suffixed.
        As stated in the section above, the distinction between classifiers and regular
compounded nouns is fuzzy and the identification of classifiers is primarily based on
their common semantics and functions.
        The set of classifiers in Kakua numbers 15 suffixes for shape specifications,
2 classifiers for texture, and 2 gender classifiers (Tables 5.1 - 5.3). The first two sets
are used with inanimate referents, while the latter is exclusively used with animate
referents (there are, however, some examples where animate referents are also taking
a classifier for shape). Tables 5.1 – 5.3 also indicate the possible etymology of this
subclass of classifiers in Kakua. This information is important also because
classifiers specifying texture are clearly related to Kakua native nouns, again blurring
the distinction between noun compounding and classifier constructions. Some
classifiers specifying for shape/form have a clear etymology from Kakua nouns or
verb roots, and some others are very likely borrowed from Arawak or Tukanoan
languages, as further discussed in sections §5.2.6 - §5.2.8.
        Note that, unlike Eastern Tukanoan languages and Arawak Tariana spoken in
the Vaupés, Kakua does not have a dedicated classifier to signal animacy of entities.
Gómez-Imbert (1996:448-449), for example, in her discussion of Tukanoan, presents
an animate/inanimate distinction in the plural, whereas in the singular animates are
marked as masculine (or non-feminine) or feminine. Kakua does not make this
animate/inanimate distinction in neither plural nor singular forms, and, as illustrated
in §5.2.6, makes a gender distinction for feminine only in restricted contexts.
Additionally, Tariana (Aikhenvald 2003:87ff) is described as having a classifier to
signal animacy of entities.
        The following Tables 5.1-5.3 show a comprehensive list of all classifiers in
Kakua. Note that the possible etymologies given in these tables do not exhaustively
explore all possible etymological sources, but they nevertheless serve to show
interesting connections between Kakua classifiers and some other Amazonian
languages.

kan-ni has an unidentified element pêjʔ, which, at this moment, remains unglossed.
In the currently available Kakua data, no source form can be identified. Presumably,
this unidentified morpheme is (or was) a verbal root because it is followed by
morphology that is exclusive to verbal elements: the verbal suffixes –kan ‘NEG’, and
–ni ‘A.NMLZ’ or ‘ADJVZ’. Possibly, this unidentified element pêjʔ is related to a blend
of the verbs roots peh-hɨm ‘be.friends/be.together-exist’ or to the compound of peh-
wîʔi-kan ‘be.friend-not.exist-NEG’. Whether or not the unidentified element pêjʔ
corresponds to a diachronic compound is thus not clear.
                                                      Elements of the noun phrase       223        The motivation for proposing a source relating to a meaning of ‘be.together’
plus an additional morphological element, relies on two facts: i) many Eastern
Tukanoan languages have a clear etymological source for the numeral ‘four’ with a
meaning similar to ‘having a companion’ (see Huber & Reed 1992 for Eastern
Tukanoan languages Tatuyo, Barasano, Tuyuka, Yurutí, Makuna, Piratapuyo,
Siriano, Karapano). Thus, extrapolating this logic to the Kakua term for ‘three’, it
could be translated into ‘that who does not have a companion’. ii) This directs the
hypothesis of thinking that possibly the form was constructed from a, previously,
complex compound involving the negative existential morpheme wîʔi-kan ‘not.exist-
NEG’, or the existential verb hɨm ‘exist’ which was attached to the verb péh meaning
‘be.together’, or ‘be friends’. Example (37) below was found in a Kakua text, in this
case, not referring to the numeral three in itself, but to an odd numbered item. Here
the speaker was counting pairs of seeds, when one seed was standing by itself in the
line of paired seeds:37) bǐʔ             tib
    other            seed     ʔã=t-péh-wíʔi-kap=wɨt=hĩ
     3SG.M=EVID-be.together-NOT.EXIST-NEG=REP.EVID=REM.PST
     ‘one seed was odd (didn’t have a partner)’        Forms for numerals 6-20 are based on terms for hands, feet, fingers and toes,
added to the terms for numerals one, two, and three. These are shown in Table 7.6
below.
        Note that in the glosses given for these lexemes, sometimes the plural
morpheme given is the animate plural -wã (e.g., ʧênewã ‘two’) or the inanimate
plural -na (e.g., ʧênna ‘two’, ʧênenamîk ‘four’). The use of either plural animate or
plural inanimate is determined by the animacy of the enumerated noun: if it is
inanimate (ʧênna mɨ ̃̌ ‘two houses’) the plural form used in the numerals is the
inanimate plural -na ‘IN.PL’. If it is animate (ʧênwã kãk ‘two persons’) the plural
form used in the numeral is the animate plural suffix -wã.","[244, 245]"

       Mythological beings and deities are treated in the same way as nouns with
human referents and thus treated in Kakua grammar just as the terms described in
sections §6.3.2 and §6.3.3. Mythological beings, as indicated above, can also include
198         A Grammar of Kakuamythological animal beings. Mythological beings are obligatorily marked for object
case =diʔ when functioning as object arguments.
        One of Kakua’s deities present in their myths of origin is ʔìdkamni.5 An
example of object marking on the name of this particular mythological being is given
below:42) jěb ʔìdkamni=diʔ               ɲi=ʔěn-ep=wɨt-hĩ

    ‘you all saw ʔìdkamni, it is said’       Additionally, terms denoting several forest spirits are also treated in the same
way as humans with regard to their animacy status and object marking. In (43)
speakers are discussing which one of the many stories about the Kuʔtʃilu can be told.
The Kuʔtʃilu is a mysterious forest being who has the ability to take people’s food
and destroy their houses without being seen. When the Kuʔtʃilu is approaching the
villages, he produces a loud horrifying noise that sounds like his name kuʔtʃilu,
kuʔtʃilu, kuʔtʃilu, and people flee away before his arrival:43) měm       hêjʔ=nit        kǎn                    kuʔtʃilu=diʔ

    ‘Do you know the Kuʔtʃilu?’6.3.5 Object marking on nouns referring to animals
        Nouns referring to animals are obligatorily object-marked when the object
argument is of the same or a higher degree of animacy than the subject. Otherwise
object marking on these is optional. Animals can be divided into three sets
corresponding to three positions on the animacy hierarchy. A first set includes
animals considered to be originally siblings to humans (Table 6.4). A second set
includes large and medium sized animals (see short list in Table 6.5). And a third set
includes small-sized animals and insects. The first two sets are often marked, while
the third set may be said to be truly optionally marked for object case when in object
function. Exemplification of object marking on animal terms will be given in the
next section.
        Kakua’s mythology considers a set of animals to be ancestral siblings to
humans (Table 6.4) (see Silverwood-Cope 1972 for a detailed description of Kakua
mythology). Therefore, terms referring to these animals could be expected to be
obligatorily marked when in object function. However, instances of nouns referring
to these ancestral siblings that lack an object case marker when in object function
        5
            The etymology of this name is not transparent, and it appears that many morphological fusions
have occurred. A possible interpretation is to translate this name as ‘the old bone person’ from ʔid ‘bone’,
kãk ‘person’, mâ ‘be.old’, -ni ‘AG.NMLZ’. A deity name with similar translations seems to be widespread
among the mythologies of many Vaupés groups (c.f., Epps & Stenzel 2013).
                                          Argument marking and case marking 199are found in the corpus (example (64)), showing that object marking is not
obligatory.","[219, 220, 221]"

divided in numbered morphological positions corresponding to the relative order of
individual morphemes that can potentially co-occur. The numbering corresponds to
the order of verbal morphemes when moving from left to right in the verb word.
Those morphemes presented as occurring in the same slot are mutually exclusive,
but also some that are presented in different slots cannot co-occur because of
semantic incompatibility. For instance, of the evidentiality enclitics from slot 12,
only the reported evidential =wɨt can co-occur with the declarative mood marker
from slot 11 (see §16.8 and Chapter 13). Another such restriction is that evidentiality
enclitics from slot 12 cannot co-occur with the assertion marker from slot 14.
     For these reasons, the templates presented in Tables 8.3 and 8.4 below are rather
idealized versions of what the verb word would look like. The forms presented in
8.4 represent a comprehensive list of the morphemes of the verb word; not all of
them can actually co-occur in a verb word.","[264, 265]"

5.3.2 Two types of obligatorily possessed nouns: inalienable possession and
      inherently possessed nouns
       Obligatorily possessed nouns represent a closed set of nouns that cannot occur
without a possessor which is phonologically bound (cliticized) to the possessed noun.
Obligatorily possessed nouns are further divided into two groups: ‘inalienable’ and
‘obligatorily’ possessed nouns. These differ in the way they are marked for
possession. While inalienably possessed nouns do not take possessive pronouns or
possessive suffixes, obligatorily possessed nouns do.
       In Kakua morphosyntax only kinship terms are treated as inalienable. Body
part terms, parts of plants, and other terms referring to things closely related to
humans, could be considered conceptually ‘obligatorily’ possessed entities, but
although these terms are obligatorily possessed, their morphological expression of
possession is crucially different from the inalienable nouns (they are not possessed
using the inalienable strategy).
       The literature on possessive constructions (e.g., Nichols 1988, Chappell &
McGregor 1996, Heine 1997, Mithun 2001) has pointed out the difficulty to
universally describe a cross-linguistic characterization of the class of nouns that can
typically be identified for inalienable possession. As pointed out by Nichols
(1988:572), ‘inalienable’ possessed nouns vary both semantically and structurally.
                             Noun compounding, noun classification and possession 173       Nichols (1988:572) proposed the following implicational hierarchy to predict
which concepts are cross-linguistically the most likely one to be morphosyntactically
treated as ‘inalienable’:                     1. Kin terms and/or body parts
                     2. Part-whole and/or spatial relations
                     3. Culturally basic possessed items        Nichols places body parts and kinship terms at the top of the scale noting that
while “kinterms and body parts disjointly head the implicational hierarchy, it can be
said that kin terms are more strongly represented” (Nichols 1988:573).
        Accordingly, the ‘inalienable’ group of nouns in Kakua is only represented
by kinship terms, reflecting Nichols’ observation about kin terms being the nouns
that are cross-linguistically most frequently treated as ‘inalienables’. In the following
sections I present more extensively the way in which Kakua expresses the notion of
inalienability vs. inherently (obligatorily) possessed nouns.","[193, 194, 195]"

13.5 Complement clauses        A complement clause is commonly defined as a clause that functions as a core
argument of the predicate of the main clause (c.f., Givón 2001:39, Dixon 2006:15-
40, Noonan 1985:46, 2007: 52). Predicates that can take a complement clause,
instead of an NP, as their argument, are commonly verbs that encode meanings of,
e.g., say, believe, wish, know, see, hear, tell (Noonan 2007). These type of predicates
                                                              Complex Clauses      359are commonly called ‘complement-taking predicates’ or ‘CTPs’ (e.g. by Noonan
2007:53).
        In Kakua, common CTPs are verbs like nih ‘say’, nǎwɁ ‘tell’, and hêjɁnahǔj
‘think/believe’ (from hêjɁ ‘know’ and hǔj ‘listen/understand’). Complement clauses
in Kakua do not take special subordinating morphology (i.e., a complementizer
particle). Syntactically, complement clauses are most typically embedded within the
main clause:30) fǐt [Iginio tew-bǔpʧew-ni=na=ka]                         fĩ=niɁ
    1PL Iginio work-have.flu-ADJVZ=DECL=ASS                    1PL=not.know    hêjɁnahǔj-kan=be
    think-NEG=REC.PST
    ‘we didn’t think [that Iginio was sick]’ (with dengue)       Although the complement clause tends to be embedded within the main
clause, alternative orders can also be found. Consider example (31), referring to a
child who is in her crawling stage, perhaps about to walk. In (31) the complement
clause occurs following the main clause. The alternative order in (32) is also accepted
by speakers.31) kǎnɁ mi=nih-hêjɁnahǔj=na
    3SG.F 3SG.F=say-think=DECL    [ʧejbit                mi=japʧi-hej-bip=na=ka]
    tomorrow               3SG.F=walk-know-FUT=DECL=ASS
    ‘she says that she thinks [that she will know how to walk tomorrow]’32) [ʧejbit  mi=japʧi-hej-bip=na=ka]                           kǎnɁ
    tomorrow 3SG.F=walk-know-FUT=DECL=ASS                      3SG.F    mi=nih-hêjɁnahǔj=na
    3SG.F=say-think=DECL
    ‘she says that she thinks [that she will know how to walk tomorrow]’       Example (33) below also shows a case in which the complement clause
follows the main clause:33) wã=hêjɁ-kan=ka              [dedpaɁ=ka          Ɂĩ=ʧãh-ãp=tagǎ]
    1SG=know-NEG=ASS              WHAT=ASS            3PL=do-PST=INF.EVID
    ‘I don’t know [what they did]’      Alternatively, the example shown above can also be analyzed as a
combination of two main clauses (e.g., ‘I don’t know, what did they do?’).
360 A Grammar of Kakua      The conditions allowing for these alternate orders have not yet been explored
and await future research.
13.6 Relative Clauses        Relative clauses are clauses that modify an NP of the main clause (c.f.,
Keenan 1985, Van Valin 2005:183-224). In Kakua, relative clauses differ from
complement clauses in that they are marked with the relativizer suffix –ni/-nit12 (here
glossed as SUBR ‘subordinator’) that attaches to the predicate of the relative clause.
The relative clause precedes the noun that it modifies. 13 When the relative clause is
modifying the object argument of the main clause, the object marker may also occur
on the relative clause (e.g. (35) below). The relativized noun phrase can be the
subject, or object (as in (35)-(36) below) within the relative clause. There is no
relative pronoun in Kakua, and as the examples below show, the subordinator suffix
marks the predicate of the relative clause:34) [fin               têw-ni]              newě     Ɂã=wɨn-at
    yesterday          work-SUBR             man       3SG.M=die-NMLZ     Ɂã=beh-ep=be
     3SG.M=go-PST=REC.PST
     ‘the man [who worked yesterday] died’ (the man who worked yesterday went
     to his death)35) [ʧɨ ̂=diɁ                     hěmɁ-ni]=diɁ        ɲɨj=diɁ
    pineapple=OBJ                 eat-SUBR=OBJ         opossum=OBJ     Ɂĩ=mâw-ap=be
     3PL=kill-PST=REC.PST
     ‘they killed the opossum [that ate the pineapple]’        12
             Note the (near) homophony of this morpheme with other functional morphemes in Kakua: the
interrogative clitic =nit ‘INTERR’ (Chapter 8), agent nominalizer suffix -ni ‘A.NMLZ’ (Chapter 4),
collective plural -nit ‘PL’ (Chapter 4), and same subject clitic =nit ‘S.S’ (Chapter 8 and section §13.3
above). The homophony of morphemes in Kakua has been seen also for other morphemes (e.g., declarative
=na, inanimate plural number -na; emphatic =bǔ and locative =bǔ). The extent to which all of the
-ni/=nit forms might have a historic relation hasn’t been explored yet. Finally, the variants -ni ~ -nit as
complementizer suffixes seem to have free variation even within one and the same speaker. Since I did
not test for a context in which one form would be preferred over the other, a more systematic study should
be undertaken in future research on Kakua.
        13
             According to Dryer (2013), relative clauses preceding the noun are rather uncommon outside
of Asia. He also points out that typologically languages in which the relative clause precedes the noun are
also verb-final languages, which is true for Kakua.
                                                               Complex Clauses      36136) [mɨhiw ɲɨn-ni]=diɁ            mɨɁ=diɁ         Ɂĩ=mâw-ap=be
    dog       chase-SUBR=OBJ agouti=OBJ           3PL=kill-PST=REC.PST
    ‘they killed the agouti [whom the dog chased]37) [katerine     ɲɨj=diɁ           ʧɨ ̂=diɁ          mi=wɨɁ-ni]=diɁ
    Katherine     opossum=OBJ       pineapple=OBJ 3SG.F=give-SUBR=OBJ    Ɂĩ=mâw-ap=be
    3PL=kill-PST=REC.PST
    ‘they killed [the opossum to whom Katherine had given pineapple]’        Examples (35)-(37) above raise various interesting questions. One concerns
the marking of object case on both the relative clause and the head noun. Probably
this marking on both elements is a formal distinction that, in addition to the use of
the subordinator marker -ni ~ -nit, helps to identify relatives clauses from other types
of subordinate clauses. Or maybe the marking of object case on both the relative
clause and the head noun can be interpreted as an apposition of a headless relative
clause and the noun to which it refers (headless relative + head N. See examples of
headless relative clauses below).
        Another interesting construction of relative clauses is that shown in example
(37). This is an internally headed relative clause, which illustrates yet another
strategy of relative clause formation. Kakua can thus be said to have externally
headed relative clauses, internally headed relative clauses, headless relative clauses,
and (maybe) the apposition of the relative clause and the head noun.
        Future research on these different subordinating constructions will
undoubtedly provide us with very enriching typological information of subordination
strategies in the languages of the area.
        Kakua frequently uses headless relative clauses. Thus, the subordinate clause
occurs on its own and, as other relative clauses, usually precedes the predicate of the
main clause. Examples of headless relative clauses are given below. Note that
perhaps because of the lack of a head NP, in this type of headless relative clauses,
the subordinate clause seems to also be able to function as an argument of the main
clause (to function as a complement clause). Headless relative clauses are, by
definition, arguments of the main clause; thus, finding a formal difference between
headless relative and complement clauses can help to set these constructions apart in
Kakua. Possibly, a formal difference is the presence of the subordinator particle -ni
~ -nit ‘SUBR’. This formal distinction will help to describe examples like the ones in
(39)-(41) below, but does not account for the headless relative in (38) which lacks
the subordinator suffix. A rigorous evaluation of the different types of subordinate
clauses and their strict formal distinctions awaits further research:

have not provided a description of arguments that may or may not be relativized
(whether or not the relativized noun can be the subject, object, or oblique, or any
other within the relative clause).

"3.1    Overview of types of morphemes
3.1.0 Overview of the morphosyntactic characteristics of the types of morphemes
         This section summarizes the main characteristics of the different types of
morphemes in Kakua.
         Syntactically, morphemes in Kakua can be divided into two basic types of
morphemes: free morphemes and bound morphemes.
         Free morphemes are monomorphemic roots, which may represent nouns,
adjectives, adverbs, or particles. Verbs, on the other hand, cannot occur as free
morphemes (exceptions to this are discussed in Chapter 8 where a full description of
Kakua’s verbal morphology is given).
         Bound morphemes can be subdivided into three types: i) roots, ii) affixes, and
iii) clitics. Bound roots have lexical semantic content, whereas formatives (affixes
and clitics) tend to have a more abstract grammatical content. Some formatives,
nonetheless, have a clear lexical source from which a grammatical function has been
derived, and both the semantic meaning and the grammatical function can still be
identified.
         Most of the grammatical morphology in Kakua occurs after the stem. Thus,
the set of suffixes and enclitics is larger than the set of prefixes and proclitics.
         Affixes can be further subdivided into inflectional and derivational affixes.
Derivational affixes are optional whereas inflectional affixes are obligatory.
         A list of the different types of morphemes in Kakua is seen in Table 3.1
below:

function as heads of phrases. Those morphemes that can function as head of phrases
are understood as words, whereas affixes and clitics form the set of formatives in
Kakua. The morphosyntactic characteristics of these formatives are described in
§3.1.2 below.

        Derivation is the most common function of classifiers in Kakua. The
derivational function of classifiers is also common in classifiers in other Amazonian
languages (see Aikhenvald 2000:220; Grinevald & Seifart 2004; Seifart & Payne
2007).
         A classifier may attach to a noun,a nominalized verb to derive other nouns
(as in (13), (15), (17), or to a verb root with no overt nominalizing morphology, also
deriving nouns as in (18), (see also §4.3 in Chapter 4 for description of v-classifier
as a nominalization strategy in Kakua). This is most typically found in terms
referring to plants (13), but it is not restricted to this semantic domain (15):13) a. mɨ

                             Noun compounding, noun classification and possession 1555.2.5 Classifiers and anaphoric reference.
       The second major function of Kakua classifiers is to establish anaphoric
reference to a previously established referent. Note that this is not a formal property
which would define classifiers, but in the absence of other nouns classifiers are often
used to refer anaphorically to a full noun.
       Anaphoric functions of classifiers have been described as a common function
for other Amazonian languages (cf., Derbyshire and Payne 1990:243, also Seifart
2007 for Witotoan, Epps 2008 for Hup, Brandão 2014 for Paresi).
       When serving an anaphoric function, classifiers need not be attached to a
related noun, and can occur on their own referring anaphorically back to a previously
mentioned full noun. This is illustrated in (24) below (repeated from example (11)
above. ‘Blowgun’ ʔɨ ̂ʔ-naʔ blowgun-CL:tree, in the first line of the example is referred
back to in the second line with naʔ=hiʔ̃́ CL:tree=COM ‘with the stick-like object’.24) nɨwá       ʔã=peb-hɨm=nit=hiʔ̃́                                        ʔɨ ̂ʔ-naʔ

      ‘the children hunt hummingbirds with the blowgun that the grandfather had
      stolen from his neighbours’        Kakua classifiers are not involved in agreement, in the sense of a syntactic
system that requires an agreement rule (rather than just semantic compatibility), and
that is prototypically obligatory and realized on multiple target elements of a clause.
Agreement or agreement-like functions have been described for many classificatory
systems in various Amazonian languages (cf., Vengoechea 2000 on Muinane;
Aikhenvald 2003 for Tariana; Seifart 2005 for Bora-Miraña; Seifart 2007 for
Witotoan languages; Seifart & Payne 2007 on various languages of Northwest
Amazonia; Danielsen 2008 on Baure; Epps 2008 on Hup; Brandão 2014 on Paresí).3
        The anaphoric function of Kakua classifiers is comparable to the agreement
function in the languages mentioned above in that classifiers in these languages also
serve to indicate anaphoric reference to a previously established entity, but differs at
least in the sense that, unlike the agreement function described for other Amazonian
languages, classifiers in Kakua do not occur in multiple constituents of the clause.
Instead, as described here, classifiers occur either attached to another noun (this can        3
            The agreement function in these languages vary in the degree of obligatoriness (or optionally
marked), or whether or not the agreement is overtly marked on several target constituents of the clause
from obligatory agreement in Bora-Miraña (Seifart 2005), to optional or even rare as described for Paresí
(Brandão 2014) and Hup (Epps 2008).
156     A Grammar of Kakuaalso be a demonstrative, pronoun, or another nominal element in general as illustrated
in some examples above), or without another noun for anaphoric reference.
       Finally, classifiers are almost always expressed, especially those referring to
shape and texture, but seem to not be obligatory as sometimes these classifiers are
not expressed when expected to be. Gender classifiers (as described below), are
expressed perhaps more optionally than shape and texture classifiers, and more
commonly expressed when the speaker considers it relevant to provide information
about the gender of the referent.","[174, 175, 176, 177, 178]"

7.5    Quantifiers
      In addition to numerals, Kakua has other morphemes that express quantity.
These are: tâwʔ ‘sometimes’, tak ‘be.middle/half’, niʔat ‘all/every’, lâ ‘times/era’,
dawǎ ‘many’, and henaʔ ‘this much/count/measure’. These terms can act like
modifiers of nouns (or adverbials) in noun phrases, or can also occur by themselves
as the head of a noun phrase functioning as quantifiers. Examples of these
morphemes expressing quantity are given below:44) panʔniʔ=na                  bɨ ̃̀   tâwʔ          wɨnɨ=tʃaʔ

large quantity or a group of entities:

7.6    The emphasis marker =bǔ
       The Kakua enclitic =bǔ is a polysemous morpheme. It serves as a locative
case marker (encoding physical and temporal location), as illustrated again in
examples (54) and (55) below (see section §6.4.1 in Chapter 6 for a description of
locative case marking):54) ʔIna         wâptʃiʔ=bǔ               mi=beh-bip=na=ka

    ‘let’s go fish downriver’       In addition to the locative use, the enclitic =bǔ also serves to emphasize a
particular participant in an event. A contrast between the locative use of this marker
and its emphatic use can be seen by comparing (54) and (55) above to the example
in (56) below.56) nih=na   beh=nit                          panʔ       ʔã=t-nih-ip=hĩ

      ‘this is the one that says, goes like this, grandfather said’      When functioning as a marker of emphasis, =bǔ can attach to subject
arguments of a clause, as in (57).2

      ‘The children hunt humming birds with the blowgun (that) grandfather had
      stolen from his neighbors’        The two meanings of this form are undoubtedly related and probably
historically derive from one morpheme; i.e. =bǔ underwent, or is undergoing, a
semantic extension, and also developed different distributions: one occurs with
subjects whereas the other (locative) cannot. The direction of this semantic extension
(or semantic shift) would probably have been from physical location which became
associated, over time, with the ‘location’ of a participant within the discourse,
following the cross-linguistically the common pathway from a concrete spatial
meaning to other more abstract meanings (e.g., of time or discourse relevance).
        Whichever the direction might be, the semantic extension, or shift, of =bǔ
developed with a functional motivation, in which either a physical location became

8.0    Introduction
        The morphology of verbs in Kakua is complex. Verbal morphology is highly
agglutinative (“concatenative” in Bickel’s 2007 terms), i.e. several functional
morphemes and roots concatenate to form the verbal word.
        While most Kakua clitics and affixes occur after the stem, verbs have the only
prefixing positions in Kakua, but even in verbs, suffixes and enclitics far outnumber
prefixes and proclitics. These prefixes encode some of the evidentiality categories
fused with aspectual distinctions (see Chapter 11), and the reflexive/reciprocal
morpheme mik- ‘RFLX/REC’.
        Verbs in Kakua inflect for person and number, and gender for 3SG, encoded
in the cross-referencing proclitics which mark agreement with subject arguments. In
principle, these proclitics are obligatory on the verb word; some semantic and
discourse conditions, however, allow for omission of these proclitics on the verb.
These criteria were discussed in Chapter 6.
        Verb stems are morphologically regular, there are almost no suppletive forms
or other types of allomorphy, with one exception, the irregular verbal stem form niʔ,
which is considered to be the past form of nih ‘say’.
        This chapter presents a detailed description of the morphology and the
structure of verbs in Kakua. Some semantic characteristics are also discussed, but
the details of semantics of the verb in Kakua await future research.
        Section §8.1 describes the phonological, morphological and semantic
characteristics of verbs in Kakua. Section §8.2 is dedicated to the different semantic
classes of verb roots, i.e. the semantic distinctions of positional, stative, motion, and
descriptive verbs. The basic morphological template of verbs and the structure of the
predicate is discussed in §8.3. Further verbal constructions, like compounding,
serialization, and other tense, aspect, mood, modality and evidentiality distinctions
are discussed in subsequent chapters.","[252, 253, 254, 255, 256, 257]"
"
10.6.3 Second-hand evidentiality
        The categories of visual (unmarked) and nonvisual, described above, can be
described as firsthand evidential categories. Additionally, Kakua has two other
categories which indicate that the proposition was not directly experienced by the
speaker. These two categories of ‘second-hand’ evidence express inferences and
reported evidence. Each of these has specific morphemes, =ta (with its allomorph
=tagǎ) and =dê for inference (§10.6.4 below), and =wɨt for reported evidentiality
(§10.6.5 below). These two second-hand categories may co-occur with a prefix,
which indicates inferential evidentiality in general, without specifying whether or
not this inference is based on some else’s report or not, and which can be used on
its own. The co-occurrence of the second hand prefixes and reported or inferred
envidentiality clitics is not obligatory.
        This prefix has three allomorphs: t- ~ ti-, and t- ~ ta- and are all glossed as
‘EVID’. The forms t- ~ ti- co-occur with the reported evidential clitic =wɨt, and the
forms t- ~ ta- co-occur with the inferred evidential clitics =ta, =tagǎ. Both prefixing
forms ti- and ta- typically undergo a phonological reduction to t-. It is possible that
in a future stage of the language the difference between the two forms ti- and ta- will
be lost, and only the form t- will survive to encode second-hand evidentiality, where
further specification for inference or reportative will be required (as it is in
synchronic Kakua). Moreover, the difference between ti- and ta- is only rarely made
by elder speakers, and younger speakers only use the prefixed form t- for both
inference and reportative evidentiality. Thus, because of this possible future path
towards a neutralization of the prefixed forms into one single ‘second-hand’
evidentiality marker in need of further specification, I propose that these are
synchronically different markers, but will at some point merge together into one.
        Even for the elder generation that still makes the difference between ti- and
ta-, the difference seem to be made exclusively when a clitic of inference or
reportative is not present. In the remaining cases when the clitics for inference or
reportative are marked, then the prefixing forms ti- or ta- seem to be more rarely
marked fully as such, and are rather found as t-.
        A few examples are shown below. More examples of the co-occurrence of
the second-hand prefix with clitics of inference or reported evidentiality can be found
below in §10.6.4 and §10.6.5 respectively.

      ‘because he fell asleep, the jaguar ate him’ (reported information)        Prefixes in Kakua must be preceded by a proclitic (with the exception of the
reflexive/reciprocal prefix mik-, see Chapter 7). Thus, a second-hand evidential
prefix (and this applies also to the nonvisual evidential prefix described above) must
be preceded by a proclitic. If there is no person proclitic, the clause is only marked
with the relevant enclitic, as in (93) below:93) hêjʔ-kan=ta=be
    know-NEG=INF.EVID=REC.PST
    ‘(they) didn’t know’ (I infer)
10.6.4 Inferred evidentiality
        Encoding inferences in Kakua requires at least one morphological marker. As
described above, Kakua has a prefix form, t- or ta-, which expresses second-hand
evidentiality in general. Additionally, the encliticized forms of these evidentiality
markers further specify inference in a more narrow sense, and often co-occur with
the second-hand evidential prefix.
        The forms of these enclitics are: =ta ~ =tagǎ, and =dê. These forms always
encode inferred evidentiality, but they are used in combination with different tenses.
Unlike the forms =ta and =tagǎ, the form =dê does not co-occur with the second
hand prefix t- ~ ta- (described in §10.6.3 above). The clitic =dê encodes an inference
made regarding a situation at a future moment. It is glossed here as a future inferred
evidential ‘FUT.INF.EVID’. The inference expressed with =dê is based on tangible
evidence or evidence that can be corroborated that a certain situation is likely to
occur. Note in example (97) below that the enclitic for future inference = dê does
not necessarily need to co-occur with the future suffix -bip ‘FUT’. Therefore, the
future inference enclitic =dê could also be analyzed as expressing both evidentiality
and future tense.15         15
           It is possible that the form of this future inferred evidential has some relation to the basic form
(de-) of interrogative pronouns and questions words (e.g., dedě ‘what’, dêdʔ ‘which’, dêʔe ‘who’, see
Chapter 7, §7.2), although the semantic connection between interrogatives and inference remains unclear.

    1SG=go-IMM.FUT=FUT.INF.EVID=ASS
    ‘I’ll leave (soon, most possibly, depending if circumstances are well)’       Using any other of the inferred evidential clitics in future tenses is not
admissible. The same construction in (96), for example, will not be possible to
express using the inferred evidential =tagǎ as illustrated by the inacceptable
sentence below:96) *wã=beh-min=tagǎ
    1SG=go-IMM.FUT=INF.EVID
    Intended meaning ‘I’ll leave (soon, most possibly)’       The future inferred evidential can attach to parts of speech other than verbs.

    WHAT=FUT.INF.EVID=EMPH                 person=DECL=ASS
    ‘will it probably be a person indeed?’        For tenses other than the future, the basic form of the inferred evidential is
the clitic =ta. If the inference refers to a situation occurring in the remote past, then
=ta immediately precedes the remote past marker =hĩ, as in (98). If the situation
occurred in the recent past, then =ta immediately precedes the recent past clitic
=be, as in (99):98) mandú-wã              ʔĩ=t-hɨm-ɨp=ta=hĩ

    ‘after having gone, they ate’ (I infer from food leftovers)        Making inferences referring to a present situation, the form of the inferred
clitic is =tagǎ. It is possible that this form comes from a fusion of the inferred
evidential =ta (shown above), and the marker of assertion=ka, which by some

invariably =tagǎ (never =taka). Note that the marker of assertion=ka does not co-
occur with the inferred evidential marker =ta. To the question of where his father
was at the moment of speech, the speaker replied as follows:100) mâwa=tagǎ
     kill=INF.EVID
     ‘(he) is killing’ (I infer, that is why he is not here)        The use of the form =tagǎ is not restricted to situations in present time. A
good number of examples in the corpus involves the co-occurrence of the form
=tagǎ and the general past suffix -Vp. In these cases, however, the form =tagǎ
never occurs together with either the recent past or remote past clitics (if these tense
clitics were to occur, the form preceding them would always be =ta and never
=tagǎ). This is illustrated in the following example:101) nin-paʔ-ka                      ʔĩ=t-nih-ip=tagǎ

12.7    Basic locative constructions
      A basic locative construction (or BLC), as defined in Levinson and Wilkins
(2006:15), is a type of construction that predominantly “occurs in response to a
Where-question”. There are two different options for expressing locative relations in
324     A Grammar of KakuaKakua. One is by means of the locative clitic =bǔ,1 the other by means of positional
verbs (of which Kakua has an extensive set). This section describes these two types
of basic locative construction. Further information on the locative marker =bǔ and
its functions is found in Chapter 6 on grammatical relations and case marking.
Chapter 8 provides more information on the semantics of positional verbs in the
context of the description of Kakua verbs.
        The locative marker =bǔ serves to express a variety of locative meanings,
among them allative ‘to/into’ and ablative ‘from’. Positional verbs cover inessive
‘in’, and adessive ‘on’ locative meanings. Examples (40)-(45) below illustrate the
stative locative, and the allative and ablative locative meanings expressed by the
locative clitic =bǔ :240) nun=bǔ               ʔã=wǎw                       hɨm-lah=na

    ‘(it) blossomed on/from both sides’
        1
            Note that =bǔ also serves as an emphasis marker; see §8.4 for a description of this clitic.
        2
            Note the co-occurrence of the locative and the object marker in example (44), suggesting that
maybe the morpheme analyzed as object marker in this book might have some other functions (marking
adjuncts as well as object arguments, for example). See the discussion on this topic in Chapter 6.
                                    Basic clause structure and types of clauses      325        The locative enclitic, as illustrated in the examples above, attaches to the head
noun of the locative NP. The locative-marked NP tends to occur in initial position
(preceding core arguments). However, it can also be seen in the examples above
(e.g., (41) and (44) that an alternative placement of the locative adjunct is possible).
        A second set of constructions expressing locative meanings are those
involving a positional verb, in which the verb specifies the location/position of the
nominal. This verb often appears as part of a serial verb construction (see Chapter
9). Constructions of this type do not require the locative marker =bǔ. Examples are
given in (46)-(47) below:46) tɨh-daʔ-beʔ
    turtle.sp-CL:round-AUG    ʔã=pẫʔ-ʧêw-dǔdʔ-feh=na

    ‘all set, I have killed (it), he (the caiman) is laying on (the fire) facing upwards’       Table §12.1 below gives some examples of positional verbs. A list of
positional verbs can be found in Chapter 8. Note that these verbs express inessive
and adessive locative meanings not expressed by the locative clitic case marker =bǔ.","[344, 345, 346]"
"
13.1.3 Adversative coordination
       Adversative expressions encoding an emphatic meaning of opposition are
marked with the particle ʔubuʔhéʔti ‘but/although/on the other hand’. Its polysyllabic
form suggests that it is historically complex, but the etymology of this word remains
unclear.3 Some examples of the use of this adversative particle are given below:         3
             Hypothetically this form may be analyzed as follows: ʔu-buʔ=héʔ=ti ‘?-?=INTS=INTS’. The
first unidentified morpheme in this analysis, ʔu, might be a nativized form of the borrowed Spanish
                                                                            Complex Clauses         34911) tɨ ̂j-ni=diʔ                     wěm bid=na=hĩ                         wã=tʃãhap=hĩ

     ‘I was searching for the good, but we were discussing (about the evil spirits) in
     Victor’s house’12) têw-at=diʔ                  ʔĩ=hîb-tʃãh        ʔã=tʃãh-niʔ=na

     1SG=EVID-be.happy=EVID but                      3PL=pay-do-NEG=REC.PST
     ‘I would’ve been having a party today if they had paid the work, but they didn’t
     pay’       In addition to the adversative particle ʔubuʔheʔtiʔ, Kakua also uses
juxtaposition to express adversative relations. Although this is more limited, and the
adversative coordinator connector ʔubuʔheʔtiʔ is preferred, a few instances of
juxtaposition with an emphatic adversative meaning are found within the corpus.
Example (13) below illustrates this adversative reading of the juxtaposed
construction. Note that in this construction the emphatic clitic =bǔ is used to encode
a contrast between the emphasized elements (see Chapter 3 for a discussion of the
emphatic semantics of =bǔ):13) kǎn=bǔ                     hɨ ̀dʔ-beʔ=na=wɨt=hĩ                                 kět=bǔ
    3SG.M=EMPH                   show-grow=DECL=REP.EVID=REM.PST                       3PL=EMPH     têw-wîʔi-kan              ʔɨm=na                kǎn=diʔ
     work-not.exist-NEG be.afraid=DECL 3SG.M=OBJ
     ‘(He) showed (the evil spirit), but they wouldn’t touch (it), they were afraid of
     him’
disjunctive o ‘or’, and the second one, buʔ, might correspond to the emphasis clitic =bǔ. Given the lack
of transparency of the form, no further hypothesis at this point can be drawn.
350 A Grammar of Kakua13.2 Subordination      The combination of clauses in an asymmetric relation in Kakua is realized
through five main strategies. These are presented in the following table, indicating
which strategy is used for which kind of subordination:Table 13.1 Subordination strategies in Kakua

 the verb of the
 subordinate clause         As shown in Table 13.1 above, these five different subordinating strategies
are used to form three types of subordinate construction in Kakua. A canonical
description of subordination regards it as a particular type of combination of clauses,
such that one of them is syntactically and semantically dependent on the other (c.f.,
Langacker 1991, Cristofaro 2003). The subordinate clause functions as a constituent
of the higher clause. This presupposes a distinction between main clauses and
subordinate clauses. I follow here the general definitions of these three types of
subordinate constructions as defined in e.g. van Gijn et al (2011:3), Cristofaro
(2003), and Haumann (1997): complement clauses, which function as arguments of
the verb of the superordinate clause, are described in §13.5; relative clauses, which
function as modifiers of a noun phrase in the superordinate clause, are described in
§13.6, and adverbial clauses, which modify the verb of the higher clause or the higher
clause in its entirety, are described in §13.7.
       As shown above, subordinate clauses in Kakua can often be identified by
morphological cues (suffixes, clitics, particles, or even verb roots): i.e., there are
morphological elements that serve to identify the subordinate clause in a complex
clause construction (Table 13.1). These elements, as introduced in Table 13.1, have
                                                              Complex Clauses      351different syntactic positions with regard to the subordinate clause. They can be in
initial position of the subordinate clause (as with the temporal adverbial particle
tɨtimaʔ ‘then’), be cliticized to an element of the subordinate clause (as with switch
reference markers when used to link adverbial subordinate clauses, see §13.7 below),
suffixes (as with the subordinator suffix -ni, see §13.5 and §13.6 below), or as post-
or prepositions (as with the potential particle pînaʔ ‘POT’ see §13.7 below).
        As presented in Chapter 11, the preferred order of constituents in Kakua is
that in which the predicate of the clause is in final position (S)OV. Adjuncts and
subordinate clauses tend to occur embedded in the main clause (see, however,
examples of exceptions to this in §13.4 for tail-head linkage, and in §13.5 for
complement clauses). The internal structure of the embedded clause also tends to
maintain the preferred OV order. Thus, in an asymmetric combination of clauses
(subordination), there are going to be two predicates, one pertaining to the
subordinated clause, and another one pertaining to the superordinate clause. A
structure similar to the following is typical for an asymmetric combination of clauses
in Kakua, where the square brackets refer to the subordinate clause in the
construction: (S)[(S)OV]OV.
        The subordinate clause furthermore in the majority of cases precedes the
element that it modifies or is an argument of in the main clause. Thus, complement
clauses (§13.5) in the majority of cases precede the predicate of the main clause, as
follows: (S)[COMPLEMENT]V (see discussion of exceptions below). Likewise, relative
clauses (§13.6) tend to precede the N they modify, but relative clauses may also
follow their head. Example (14) illustrates a complement clause that precedes its
head, the predicate of the main clause.","[369, 370, 371, 372]"
"
Position 3: Number marking
       Kakua distinguishes between singular and non-singular. Singular is
unmarked. Non-singular number is marked by means of three different morphemes.
The choice of these morphemes depends on the semantics of the noun. Some nouns,
such as màɁ ‘water’, or běp ‘mud’ don’t take number marking, suggesting that they
form a set of mass nouns. However, the mass-count noun distinction in Kakua hat
not been studied further so far.
       The plural suffix -na serves to encode plural number for most inanimate
nouns, as illustrated in (8)-(9):8)      mɨ ̌–na
        house-PL
        ‘houses’9)      miʔ=nih-at-na
        3SG.F.POSS=say-NMLZ-PL
        ‘her sayings’        The plural suffix -wã encodes plural number for most animate nouns, as
illustrated in (10)-(11) below:
132        A Grammar of Kakua10) kãk-wã
    person-PL
    ‘people’11) jǔ-wã
      armadillo-PL
      ‘armadillos’        A small set of nouns occur with the plural suffix -nit, as illustrated in (12):12) nom–nit
    bloodsucker.leech-PL
    ‘leeches’       The -nit suffix, is used to mark plurality for a small set of nouns that are
conceived as belonging to a group or as moving in groups or bands. Note that this is
not necessarily a group of smaller animals like leeches or mosquitos, but also
includes larger animals such as monkeys (though never human beings, or large
animals like tapirs, or jaguars), as in (13) below:13) nakni                             vs.     nak-nit
    ‘monkey (generic)’                        ‘monkeys’
Position 4: Possessive suffix -ǐʔ
       This position is filled by the possessive suffix -ǐʔ. Possession of nouns in
Kakua is marked on the dependent element of the possessive construction, i.e. the
possessive suffix is attached to the possessor.14) hun=hĩ                 ʔã=pĩ-pê-hǔj-up=hĩ                       kǎn

    ‘(we were) at Samu’s house’       Possession is not marked twice. Thus, if a proclitic pronoun precedes the
construction the possessive suffix -ǐʔ is not used. This is shown in (16) below
(compare to example (15) above):

described in Chapter 5.","[153, 154, 155]"

             This is a particularly interesting distinction, which applies to all birds, in addition to the term
for ‘deer’ wa.̀ This bird-feminine classifier is used when the reference to a female bird must be made.
Otherwise, birds do not require the feminine classifier. The motivations for developing this distinction
only for birds is still unclear.
                            Noun compounding, noun classification and possession 157        As described in Chapter 8 on Kakua verb morphology, and Chapter 12 on
clause structure in Kakua, subject arguments are cross-referenced on the verb
through proclitics. These proclitics make gender distinctions only for third person
singular, while the rest of the paradigm remains without a specification for gender,
neither on the pronominal system, nominal, or verbal inflections.
        The feminine gender classifier -ma, as noted above, has a restricted
distribution. It is suffixed only to nouns referring to birds, and, unexplainably so,
also to the noun wa ̀ ‘deer’:25) jâwʔ                       ‘macaw’
      jâwʔ-ma                  ‘female macaw’26) hǔp                        ‘vulture’

(my fieldnotes), both spoken in the Vaupés area, the feminine classifier is -ma.5
       All other animate nouns, when these need to be specified for feminine gender,
are suffixed with the feminine classifier -wili:29) weʔbit-wili

5.2.7 Shape classifiers
        Classifiers specifying shape (and sometimes, by extension, also function)
attach mainly to nouns with inanimate referents. The list of shape classifiers is given
in Table 5.2 above. Specification for shape is very common with inanimate nouns.
Classifiers almost always appear in nouns referring to body parts. However, some
nouns with inanimate referents never include classifiers specifying their shape,
among them nouns referring to large objects, like mɨ ‘house’, or jêw ‘sun’. Besides
body parts, the marking of classifiers is common also in semantic domains such as
plants, objects of cultural and subsistence needs such as pots, manioc grinders,
machete, baskets, arrow, bow, blowgun, etc.
        Some classifiers can also be used to refer to the shape or form of an animate
entity. In these cases, the classifier has a descriptive-like function. See example (33)
below, where the shape classifier is suffixed to a noun (or adjective) referring to an
animate entity:33) mi=t-tʃãw-hɨj=na                      mi=nɨm-daʔ=diʔ
    3SG.F=EVID-stay-arrive=DECL            3SG.F=daughter-CL:round=OBJ
    ‘She arrived with her child (daughter)’34) buʔé-ni              bɨdǐ-daʔ
    teach-A.NMLZ          big-CL:round
    ‘the big fat teacher’        The use of the classifier for round shapes with animate entities seen in
examples (33)–(34) above, is quite common in Kakua. Often Kakua speakers use
this classifier to refer to children, as rounded beings, but it may also be used to refer
to obese adults, or animals that have a round shape, such us turtles tɨh-daʔ [turtle-
CL:round] ‘turtle’, or armadillos jǔ-daʔ [armadillo-CL:round]. Note that the use of
shape classifiers with animate entities functions as a modifier to the noun, and in
these cases the classifier is not obligatory.
                             Noun compounding, noun classification and possession 159     A. Round shape classifier -daʔ
      This classifier is used with entities that have rounded, oval, or oblong shapes.
As seen in (33)-(34) above, it may also be used with animate entities.635) wǎw-daʔ
    head-CLːround
    ‘head’36) hě-daʔ
    mountain-CLːround
    ‘hill/mountain’37) tip-daʔ

    ‘egg’38) ʔãjʔ=mah-daʔ                                       tʃɨd-ɨp=wɨt=hĩ
    3SG.M.POSS=basket-CL:round                          sit-PST=REP.EVID=REM.PST
    ‘His basket was sitting (aside)’        The round shape classifier can also attach to nominalized verbs, deriving a
noun with the meaning ‘rounded thing for VERBing’. Examples (39)-(42) below
illustrate this:39) ʔêw-daʔ
    sing-CLːround
    ‘throat’ (rounded thing to sing)40) tiw-at-daʔ
    play-CLːround
    ‘ball’ (rounded thing to play)41) pêwʔ-at-daʔ
    to.hammer-NMLZ-CL:round
    ‘hammer’ (round thing to hammer) (alternative term: pêwʔ-at-naʔ to.hammer-
    NMLZ-CL:tree)

           This use of a shape classifier with animate referents seems to be most common with the round
shape classifier. However, I also report one instance when the classifier for ‘tree’ shape, was used to refer
to a skinny person. It is interesting to note that Kakua seems to be showing a similar use of shape-
classifiers with animate referents as what Gomez-Imbert (1996) describes for Cubeo, where the principal
shape distinction that has spread to animates involves roundness.

334    A Grammar of Kakua12.10.3 Responding to interrogatives
       Content questions are typically answered with a (declarative) clause, or with
a single word that provides the particular information solicited.
       Polar (yes-no) questions can be responded to positively in two ways: with the
                       ̃̂ ‘yes, aha’ (84)-(85) or by repeating in a declarative form the
affirmative particle hɨhɨ
verb phrase that appeared in the interrogative (86)-(87). Subjects are frequently
dropped, as in (84) and (86).","[352, 353, 354, 355]"

    J.    Long, thin and pointed shapes classifier -dubʔ
       Nouns denoting entities having a long, thin and pointed shape, are marked
with the classifier -dubʔ. The source of this classifier is unknown. There is no verb
or noun root in Kakua that can give clues motivating a derivation of this classifier
from a lexical root. Examples are given in (63)-(65):63) ɲɨp-at-dubʔ
    throw-NMLZ-CL:thin.pointed
    ‘arrow’64) hǐ-at-dubʔ
    light.up-NMLZ-CL:thin.pointed
    ‘candle’65) juk-dubʔ
    feather/hair-CL:thin.pointed
    ‘feather’
    K. Layered classifier -tuliʔ
         Nouns denoting inanimate entities with layers, like stacks, are marked with
-tuliʔ. The source of this form is unclear, but it is very unlikely to be a native Kakua
166     A Grammar of Kakuaform, since it violates the vowel harmony principle for monomorphemic bisyllabic
structures/morphemes (see Chapter 2 on Kakua phonology).
       The Wanano form -thu denoting stacked entities (Stenzel 2004ː145) may be
related to the classifier -tuliʔ in Kakua. Examples for Kakua are given below:66) màʔ-tuliʔ
    water-CL:layers
    ‘cloud’1067) dǎk-at-tuliʔ
    write-NMLZ-CL:layers
    ‘book’
      L. Bundle classifier -kuduʔ
        Nouns denoting inanimate entities that are bounded together, e.g. a bundle of
sticks, bound together with a rope or a thread, or tied up objects, are marked with
the classifier -kuduʔ. This includes, wrists ankles, which can be seen as the point
where fingers or toes are held together. The source of this classifier is obscure. The
form -kuda found in Arawak Tariana (Aikhenvald 2003:89) resemblance the form in
Kakua, but the semantics are not so clearly connected: -kuda ‘CL:trunk’, vs Kakua
-kuduʔ ‘CL:bundle’. Additionally, there is a Tukanoan form meaning ‘group’ or
‘bunch’, which has been borrowed into Hup (Epps 2015), maybe suggesting a
Tukanoan source for this classifier in Kakua as well. Examples below show the use
of this bundle classifier in Kakua:68) hitʃa-kuduʔ
    foot-CL:bundle
    ‘ankle’69) tejʔja-kuduʔ
    hand-CL:bundle
    ‘wrist’70) keh-kuduʔ
    fish-CL:bundle
    ‘bundle of fishes tied up with a rope’         10
           Speakers of Kakua recognize that this is a modern form for clouds, and recognize a construction
no longer used, maʔ-pũʔ water-tip ‘cloud’. The morpheme pũʔ is found also in other constructions with
the meaning of ‘tip of’, and is apparently falling in disuse. It is likely that it functioned as a classifier, but
because the data does not show enough instances of this form, at this point is difficult to propose a more
accurate analysis for this form.
                               Noun compounding, noun classification and possession 167     M. Circle classifier -hɨdɨ
   The classifier -hɨdɨ is related to the Kakua verb hɨ ̂d ‘to.surround/go.in.circles’.
Consider the following example:71) nem-at-hɨdɨ                                ‘button’
    close-NMLZ-CL:circle        In the following example from a text, the classifier occurs first with the noun
tʃujubʔpu ‘shield’ in (72) and once established, it occurs on its own for anaphoric
reference to the circled thing that had already been mentioned (73):72) ʔã=nɨm-daʔ=diʔ                                       wej̃̌      ʔĩʔ=tʃujubʔpu-hɨdɨ=diʔ

      give
      ‘he spoiled his daughter; and (he) handed over their shield’ (and said)ː73) nin                             hɨdɨ=hiʔ̃́            fĩ-nɨm=diʔ                      jɨ ̂bɨ
      DEM.PROX                     CL:circle=COM          1PL=daughter=OBJ                 mosquito      mâw-ɲɨ ̃̌n-ɨp=na
      kill-chase-PST=DECL
      ‘with this circled one (you) can shoo away the mosquitos from our daughter’11
58     N. Hard container classifier -pajʔ
        Examples in (74)-(75) below show the classifier -pajʔ, which denotes entities
that have a hollow interior and that serve as containers, as long as these entities have
a hard exterior. Container-like forms with a softer shell are denoted with the classifier
-ɨdʔ as seen in example (76), further below.74) ʔâmo-at-pajʔ
    pack-NMLZ-CL:hollow
    ‘closet’        11
              Note that the 1PL proclitic refers to the possessor daughter, but not to the subject of shooing
away. The subject of shooing away is stated earlier in the discourse; this was the 2SG pronoun, which is
here omitted because it can be recuperated from discourse. Note also that it could be that the classifier
for ‘circled shape’ in (73) may be bound to the demonstrative that precedes it, instead of standing on its
own. The primary phonological clue motivating to present the demonstrative apart from the classifier is
that in example (73) there is a pause in between the demonstrative and the classifier.

75) nem-at-pajʔ
    close-NMLZ-CL:hollow
    ‘wooden hollow trunk/wardrobe’
      O. Soft container classifier -ɨdʔ
        The classifier –ɨdʔ serves to denote inanimate entities that function as
containers, with the specific quality of having a soft shells, such as shoes, like in
example in (76) belowː76) hítʃa-ɨdʔ
    foot-CLːcontainer
    ‘shoes’        The etymological source of this classifier is not clear. Nɨkak’s classifier for
nouns denoting a shape or function of container-like is -dɨʔ ‘container’. Although the
forms in these two languages have the same phonological elements, they differ in
their structure and at this point no satisfactory explanation can be posited to account
for a similarity between Kakua -ɨdʔ and Nɨkak -dɨʔ.","[187, 188, 189, 190]"
