           ‘He eats rice.’
           ‘Does he eat rice?’   The more common illocutionary force particles are listed below. The correct use of the
different particles is determined by reference to the relationship that the speaker and the
addressee share (casual, joking or formal and distant), and are also dependent on the sex of
the addressee, and relative age of the speaker and the addressee. Often more than one
particle is appropriate to any two persons speaking to each other; in these situations, the
use of the particle may be taken to show the speaker’s degree of empathy with her or his
audience. For example, between two sisters, (63) is much colder and more pompous than
is (64):   (63)    Te      iko'o    na       ako —_ ttum]ulungi-aku          wa?
           CORE    2SG      NOM      PURP       help.SI-1SG.OBJ      ILL.FORCE
            ‘Are you going to help me?’   (64)    Te      iko'o    na       ako      ~= t{um]ulungi-aku     da?
           CORE    2SG      NOM      PURP       help.SI-1SG.OBJ      ILL.FORCE
            ‘Are you going to help me?’Whilst both are appropmate to the situation, the use of the less casual wa in (63) can be
construed as excluding the listener from the relationship that would be signalled by the use
of da. Further work remains to be done on the use of the illocutionary force particles.
    The particles so far identified are:
460     Chapter 19             -a            casual, joking address
             -da _ expressing camaraderie; ‘as you know’, between (rough) equals
             -ga _ (close) family relation
             -ka           child or very familiar addressee
             -la           male addressee
             -na__         familiarity and certainty of message
             -wa           female addressee
                           (all glossed as ILL.FORCE)             -i            ‘isn’t it?’ (used in combination with the other IF particles)
                           (glossed as TAG or FAMILIAR)Of these, la and wa                are by far the most common      in use, and ga the least common.
Individuals show variation as to the degree of flexibility they use in the application of da or
ka; a seventy year old shaman, for instance, has no qualms with using ka to the author,
and even da as the situation demands (expressing solidarity), but would not use ga. Some
children will use ga to distant relatives in order to try and force them to do something
normally only required of an immediate parent or cousin, but would not use ka to the same
person (even if the same age).
    The common male and female particles /a and wa serve an interesting function when
addressing a mixed group: a speaker can single out only the male, or only the female
members of the group as the addressee of a command through the addition of the
appropriate particle:      (63)           Mai        t{umJulungi-aku     wa!
                     come help.SI-1SG.OBJ      ILL.FORCE
                     ‘Come on (you girls) and give me a hand!”

                     ‘Hey, go on all of you (boys) and push my canoes (further up the beach)!’
                     (so the tide won’t carry them away)
                     (girls: keep on playing)This use is not often found with the other, less rigidly defined illocutionary force particles
(such as ka) since the commands are then more ambiguous. In those cases, the current
activity (in a headless relative clause) or (nick)name of the desired performer is used.

             Pivots and grammatical relations
20.1    Introduction: kinds of pivotsThis chapter brings together the information on syntactic and morphological pivots from
various parts of the preceding description, and adds additional information on phenomena
not yet covered. This is done with the purpose of exemplifying the problems associated
with the notion of ‘pivot’ and ‘subject’ in Tukang Besi.
    I shall use ‘pivot’ in the same sense that it is used in Dixon (1979) to refer to the
argument or particular grouping of arguments to which a particular syntactic or
morphological operation is sensitive. These arguments in turn have usually been defined in
terms of the syntactic roles that they bear (Dixon (1994: 6) calls these “semantic-syntactic
primitives”). The syntactic roles relevant to the easy discussion of these processes are [S},
[A] and {O); these have been explained and defined in chapter 3. A similar use of the term
‘pivot’ is found in Van Valin (1981), and Foley and Van Valin (1984).
    Given the [A], [S} and [O] syntactic roles, we may observe that different languages use
different groupings of these roles in the formation of pivots for grammatical processes.
Furthermore, there are two sorts of pivots. Firstly, there are GRAMMATICAL PIVOTS,
those whose identity is particular to the language or grammatical process in question, such
as the common [S,A] pivot in English, or the [S,O] pivot of Yup'ik, exemplified above.
    On the other hand we also find SEMANTIC PIVOTS, those that are determined by the
inherent semantics of the syntactic process to which they apply, such as the addressee of
imperatives being restricted to Agents, regardless of the language’s pivot choice in other
syntactic processes. (Dixon (1994 and elsewhere) claims that the restriction is to arguments
in (S] or [A] function, and this is certainly true for many languages, but this is not the case
in Tukang Besi, in which it is ungrammatical to request someone to be the subject of a
passive verb, or to hear something by chance, or (pragmatically possible with a shaman) to
request the sun to dry something, or the rain to fall (these meteorological requests are
phrased with the natural force as the causer of a causative verb, and thus an agent). In
many cases the morphological and syntactic groupings that a language distinguishes are
identical, such as the consistent use in English of an [S,A] grouping in its choice of both
morphological pivots (the use of nominative or oblique case on pronouns) and syntactic
pivots (such as conjunction reduction exemplified in (1)).
    Furthermore, morphological classification and syntactic pivots don’t have to agree;
Chung noted, in her study of grammatical relations in Polynesian languages, that       The NP categories picked out by the case marking rule(s) of a language may
       differ from the categories to which other syntactic rules refer. (1978:99)leading to the extra problems of classifying the morphological categories and the syntactic
462    Chapter 20categories of a language.
    So far we have discussed pivots that can be defined in terms of syntactic roles - [A],
[S] (with its subsets) and [O] (as defined in chapter 3, and see also Dixon 1994). There are
also languages with definite, morphologically distinct, pivots that do not operate in these
terms. Good examples of the latter are those languages of the Philippine-type that do not
(despite more than their share of attempts to force them into either an ergative or an
accusative mould. For some examples of these analyses see, amongst many others, Blake
(1991), De Guzman (1988), Gerdts (1988), Guilfoyle et al (1992), Byma (1986). For a
counter to these views, see Foley and Van Valin (1984), Kroeger (1993), Maclachlan
(1995b)) have a fixed choice of pivot, but need to specify in each clause which argument is
the pivot (for most grammatical constructions, including, for Tagalog, Quantifier Float,
Relativisation, Number Agreement, Raising, Possessor Ascension, and Conjunction
Reduction. See Schachter (1976, 1977) or Kroeger (1993) for exemplification of these
properties) - the nominative argument, using the terminology introduced in chapter 3.(I
shall not enter a discussion of the very interesting languages with inverse systems of verbal
indexing, such as various Algonquian languages (see e.g. Wolfart 1973, or more recently
Dahlstrom 1991) and others (Dunn 1995 MS, Donohue 1996d), which also appear to
display mismatches between morphological and syntactic categories, and which also
display wide-reaching morphological reflections of pragmatic status). It is possible for a
clause to select either [A] or [O] to be the pivot of a transitive construction, but each choice
involves morphological choices as well. The choice of which argument is nominative is
presumably determined by pragmatics (although how remains unclear. See Kroeger 1993
(Chapter 3) for a counter view with respect to Tagalog), and indicated by morphology on
both the verb and the nominal. Different Philippine-type-languages may have anything
upwards of two (e.g., Sama/Bajau) basic morphologically distinct pivot choices. As Givén
(1984: 167) puts it,       ...case-marking systems of various kinds may be viewed as different solutions
       to the   same   functional   dilemma...With    respect   to subjectivization,   the
       Philippine solution is in a way rather elegant. Nouns that are not in the
       pragmatic case-role of subject/topic are marked for their semantic roles, by
       prefixes. The subject/topic noun is marked by prefix for its pragmatic role.
       And the verb is marked (by various prefixes/infixes/suffixes) for the semantic
       role of the subject/topic.","[485, 486, 487, 488]"
"4.7     A note on ‘derivational’ and ‘inflectional’ categoriesAs with the distinction between different word classes, so too is the distinction between
derivational and inflectional morphology somewhat tenuous for Tukang Besi. This can be
illustrated with the set of object suffixes. As would be expected of an inflectional class,
they are fully productive; any transitive verb may (optionally) take object suffixes, and
some verbs require them. The existence of such pairs as ja‘o ‘bad’ and ja'oke ‘ruin’
(morphologically decomposable into the adjective ‘bad’ + the affix ’third person object
suffix’), exemplified in 4.5, example (62), might be taken as proof that the set of object
suffixes can function as a means of deriving transitive verbs from intransitive ones. This
view would assume that the presence or absence of object-indexing morphology on the
verb dictated the article choice on the KP; in fact, as the choice of articles on the KPs is
really a case-marking system that makes overt a pragmatic prominence due to the role that
the argument in question plays in the discourse situation, it is better to think of the abstract
Case ‘nominative’ being assigned to the KP on the base of discourse criteria (given,
prominent information, ongoing salience in the narration or conversation). Should that
argument not be the highest on the hierarchy of semantic roles that the main verb of its
clause subcategorises for, then the verb must be marked by object suffixes. Since some
verbs, such as ja’o ‘bad; ruin’ have a stipulation in their lexical entries that the nominative
argument must be the [Patient], these verbs must use object suffixes when they are
presented with a nominal argument serving as an [O].

                                       Pronouns5.1.         Personal pronounsThere are two basic divisions in the category ‘pronoun’ in Tukang Besi, between the free
forms that function to (almost) all intents and purposes as common nouns in KPs and PPs,
but are used only rarely in real discourse, and the five sets of pronominal affixes that are
obligatorily attached to verbs, to indicate the person and number of the subject and object,
or to nominals, to indicate the possessor of that nominal. These may generally cooccur, but
there are some environments in which only one of the two sets may occur (see section 5.2
for details).
     Tukang Besi distinguishes pronominal forms in three persons, and in the free forms
distinguishes singular and plural forms in all persons. In addition, the first person non-
singular is divided into two rather loosely distinguished subsets of dual-paucal and plural,
with considerable overlap in usage between the two. The bound sets of pronouns
distinguish number only for the first and second person, with number not marked in the
third person in any of the five sets.
     The form and function of all the pronominal forms are discussed in this chapter.
Chapter 7 discusses other details of the appearance of the verbal affixes, and chapter 18
presents information about the function of verbal affixing in conjoined phrases and
reciprocal constructions.
    The pronominal forms, both free and bound, are set out in table 7:                            Table 7. Tukang Besi pronominal forms                 Irrealis    Realis      Free    Possessive      Object       Dative

       3PL       na- | a-   no-/o-    _ amai      -no               -'e      (amai)
114     Chapter 5Notice the following points about the pronominal affixes:a.    No distinction is made between the third person singular and plural forms in the
      affixes; the -ne object suffix is almost obsolete in Wanci. In addition to -'e and -ne,
      there is a conditioned allomorph -ke, described in chapter 2.b. The first person singular subject prefix does not have different realis and irrealis forms.c.    Apart from the third person, the object agreement markers resemble transparently their
      corresponding free forms.d.    Whilst the third person shows no distinction in number, and the second person
      differentiates between singular and non-singular, there are two pronominal sets
      corresponding to the first person non-singular, ikami and ikita, glossed as “1PA”
      (paucal) and “iPL” (plural) respectively. These pronouns are used with a lot of overlap
      by most speakers, but the ikami forms usually refer to a small group of people,
      typically two to four, and the ikita forms typically refer to groups of four or more,
      though they have been heard with reference to as few as two people. Note that the
      fundamental difference between the two is NOT one of exclusive/inclusive as is usually
      the case in Austronesian languages (at least as far as the speech of older, more
      traditional speakers is concerned), but of ‘paucal’ versus ‘plural’ reference. An
      example of this is (1), overheard in a canoe:
      (1)    Ko-bose          kua   = jambata?
              IPA.R-paddle    ALL     jetty
              ‘Are we (incl.) paddling to the jetty?’      Given the environment of the speech act, it could only be assumed that the speaker
      included the addressee in the utterance, providing a certain inclusive reference.
      Younger speakers have been observed using them with the exclusive/inclusive
      distinction rather than paucal/plural, thus bringing Tukang Besi back into typological
      line with its other Austronesian relatives; this might be the result of having learnt
      Indonesian at school and learnt the exclusive/inclusive distinction that kami and kita
      show in Indonesian.e.    When a speaker wishes to show respect to the addressee, the second person plural
      forms are used in place of the second person singular forms (ikomiu, etc.). Respect
      may be paid to a group of people addressed, or a greater degree of respect paid to an
      individual, by the use of the first person plural forms (ikifa, etc.).f.    The first person plural free pronoun is sometimes used by older people to refer to
      themselves when addressing younger people, sometimes displaying a slight feeling of
      annoyance in the use of such forms. The first person plural affixes are not used in this
      context, only the free form of the pronoun.g.    The dative object forms appear to be almost obsolete in Northern Tukang Besi. In
      general, their use has been supplanted by the general object forms, and they are
                                                                                              Pronouns     115
      consistently used only by Tomea and Binongko speakers. In other dialect areas they
      are a mark of archaic speech.h.    The first person plural forms are used as a ‘generic pronoun’, such as:
      (2)      To-[m]o-ha'a-ke?
               1PL.R-VRB.SI-why-30BJ
               ‘What shall we do about it?’

               ‘If you make a basket,...’5.2         Use of the free formsThe use of a full (free form) personal pronoun in Tukang Besi discourse is rare, since most
clauses are verbal and there is extensive indexing of the role information of the arguments
on verbs. Nevertheless, full personal pronouns are obligatory in certain syntactic and
discourse environments, specifically as the:a.    Subject of an equative or locational clause:      (4)      [Te      [iaku]pro xp e       guru       di                   SD                   Wandoka.

              “We came from (his place).’With ako and kene, the object suffixes or possessive suffixes may also be used. Pronouns
may not head a prepositional phrase governed by kua or mina. See chapter 13 for more
information. It is interesting to note that these contexts are exactly those that do not have
any morphological positions for affixed pronominal forms; with no verb in the sentence,
there is no position for a verbal affix to appear (some speakers allow the negative
existential mbea’e to inflect for the person of the existant, so that the form in (7) would be
mbea-kami. Most speakers regard this as ungrammatical, however).
      The use of the free pronouns in KPs in verbal clauses is never ungrammatical, but if
they are present as core arguments of the verb they must agree in number and person with
the indexing on the verb dictated by their article and the verbal indexing (see chapter 3). In
some environments either a bound pronominal form or a free pronoun, but not both, must
be used; the appearance of both together is blocked. These environments includea.    Serial verb constructions:      (10)    a.   No-potae    kua_     te     boku-no           ako       te     iko'o.

"7.6          Object suffixesMost     transitive    verbs   can    be suffixed        with   object   suffixes,   and    many   intransitive
(‘ambitransitive’) verbs too may occur with object suffixes (see chapter 4); these index the
direct object of the verb, and are portmanteau forms expressing the number and person of
the object. Their affect on the structure of the verbal complex is minimal, but they
drastically affect the distribution of the core case-marking articles (see chapter 3 for a
summary of this and other KP marking strategies). The use of object suffixes is also
largely dependent on discourse factors, namely givenness, specificity (rather tahn
definiteness), and topic continuity, much like the use of passive forms in English. In this
way, the object suffixes are the equivalent of passive forms in languages such as English
as regards discourse functions (special thanks to C. Donohue for first pointing this
correspondence out to me in 1992), creating a new pivot of the sentence for certain
constructions. Compare (41) with sentence (42):      (41)      No-‘ita-'e      te      Sanggila   na      tukatutu                   jan      —_—no-tode.

                 ‘The blacksmith was seen by the pirate, and so fled.’
              * ‘The pirate saw the blacksmith, and so fled.’      (42)      No-‘ita    tt     Sanggila     na     tukatutu                   jan__—no-tode.

                ‘The blacksmith saw the pirate, and so fled.’
              * ‘The blacksmith saw the pirate, and so the pirate fled.’
Both of these sentences show the preverbal KP of the first sentence coreferential with the
subject of the second, but in the case of (41) it is the object of the verb no‘ita’e, and not the
subject, that is judged to be coreferential with the elided KP in the second clause. The
subject prefixes on the verb, however, continue to index the person and number of na
                                                                                           Verb phrases   159tukatutu, showing that the subject remains a core argument. The grammatical status of
nominative arguments is examined in greater depth in chapter 20.
    An important use of the object suffixes is when they are obligatorily used to indicate
that the [Theme/Patient] argument of an ambitransitive verb is the object, and not the
subject, of the clause. Unlike English, most otherwise intransitive verbs cannot be simply
used with an added object:    (43)     a.   No-hesowui       na          ana-su               mai       iso.

                  NOM__     wife-1SG.POSS
                  ‘My wife is washing my children.’Sentence (43b) is acceptable with the addition of a causative prefix, as in (43d), but now
there is less direct involvement; with the causative prefix, the statement could be interpreted
as ‘My wife is making my children wash themselves.’, as well as ‘My wife is washing the
children.’ The first interpretation is not a grammatical reading of (43c).
This can be simply described:in terms of the requirement that the argument in
[Theme/Patient] role be consistently marked as nominative; when the object suffix is added
to the verb, the argument that was serving as the subject of the intransitive verb is the
object of the new verb, and an agent is added. This may be represented in terms of clausal
structure as follows:            s-V             naS          4)
            L
            s-V-0           naO          teA     The argument structure account, however, as presented in chapters 3, 4 and 20, is
preferred here to the interpretation that the object suffixes are seen as derivational, which
the above formula, lucid though it is, would imply. See chapter 4 for examples of the sort
of verbs (not by any means all of those with a [Theme/Patient] argument) that enter into
this sort of construction.
160     Chapter 77.6.1        Object suffixes: a second accountThe object suffixes have been presented as pronominal indexing of the object on the verb,
yet this analysis does not account for the variation in case marking that was described in
chapter 3. Accordingly, one possible extension to this analysis will be presented here. The
fact that the object suffixes are not compulsory, as is the case with the subject prefixes, has
led to their use in monitoring the status of participants and disambiguating discourse. A
sentence with and without object suffixes is given in (44):      (44)      a.   No-‘awa        te       boku      na         ana.
                     3R-get         CORE book          NOM        child
                     ‘The child got the book.’                b.   No-'awa-'e      na      boku      te         ana.
                     3R-get-30BJ)    NOM     book      CORE       child
                     ‘The child got the book.’As has been described in chapter 3, the type of verbal indexing (presence versus absence
of object suffixes) correlates with predictable variation in the case marking on nominals,
and variation in their syntactic behaviour (see chapter 20), showing that the variation in
case is not merely morphological.
    This is exactly the same correlation exhibited by the better-known verbal affixes and
KP marking in various Philippine languages, as demonstrated by the following pair of
sentences from Tagalog (I am not going to enter the debate about the theoretical
significance of what has here been blithely termed ‘focus’, or the nominal versus verbal
nature of the affixed words in Philippine languages, in this book. For a discussion of these
question, see (amongst (many) others) Schachter 1976 and 1977, and Kroeger 1993. The
glosses in Tagalog sentences follow Kroeger’s conventions):      (45)           Tagalog:
                a.   Kumuha_     ng      libro   ang         bata.
                     get.AV      GEN-    book    NOM         child
                     ‘The child got a book.’                b.   Kinuha      ng      bata    ang _       libro.
                     get.oV.     GEN     child   NOM _       book
                     ‘The child got a book.’Just as in Tukang Besi, the ‘articles’ marking the noun phrases change with the change in
verbal morphology. This could be good evidence that the Tukang Besi verbal system
operates on a similar basis to the Philippine ‘focus’ system, as exemplified here by
Tagalog. Immediate objections to this could be raised, arguing that the Tukang Besi system
is clearly a pronominal inflection system on the basis that the object suffixes show
variation for person and number, whereas the Tagalog verbal system does not. Compare
the following sentences in Tagalog (46) and Tukang Besi (47):
                                                                                                  Verb phrases   161    (46)               Tagalog:

                  ‘The woman slapped you.’The sentences in (46b) and (46c), and (47b), (47c) and (47d) clearly show that while the
Tagalog sentences do not require the verbal morphology to reflect the person or number of
the participants, the Tukang Besi object suffixes vary in form for tis parameter; the
ungrammaticality of (47d) clearly demonstrates this. This could be taken as an argument
that the Tukang Besi object suffixes on the verb are pronominal inflections, rather than part
of a ‘focus’ or voice system of the kind exemplified by the Tagalog data. The full
‘inflectional’ paradigm for the verb pili is as follows (keeping the third person subject
constant):                                     Notopaaku           _—‘Notopako           Notopa'e
                  ‘S/he slapped...       ...me.’              ..-you.”             ...her/him/it/them.’                                     Notopakami      Notopakita                Notopakomiu
                                         ...US few.”     —...us all.’              ...you lot.’    It should be borne in mind, however, that the Tagalog system also shows variation. At
the purely verbal level, the object suffixes vary in Tukang Besi, changing depending on the
person and number categories of the object in the clause; these same categories are
irrelevant in Tagalog, in which the same verbal affix being is used for objects regardless of
person or number. At the clause level, however, the noun phrase marking ‘articles’ in
Tagalog show considerable variation, the choice of the article depending on whether the
KP is a common             noun   ((48a) and (48e) below), a proper noun ((48c) and (48g)), a
162     Chapter 7pronoun (in which case a suppletive form of the pronoun is used, as in examples (48b) and
(48f), which may combine with a separate case-marking article as well) or a demonstrative
(which also displays suppletive forms, but which never appear with a preceding article;
(48d) and (48h)).","[184, 185, 186, 187, 188]"
"13.2     Phrasal possessionIn this section I will deal with possessive constructions on a phrasal level, both the
pronominal possessive suffixes and the genitive phrase. These are typically used to show
the following range of concepts:    °    ownership of objects (canoes, ships, clothes) and land (gardens, land for houses);    °    kin relations (mother, father, child, in-laws) and social relations (friend, slave);    °    body part relationships to the whole (tail of a dog; hair of the head (of a friend));    °    general part-whole relationships (fruit of a tree, door of a house);   °     qualities of an object (distance, ability, stupidity);    ° — spatial relation (where something is located with respect to another referent);    °    mental activity or actions (decision of a group, terror of an individual)13.2.1       Pronominal possessionIn chapter 5S the forms of the possessive suffixes were discussed. The information relevant
to possession that was presented there is repeated here. The form of the possessive suffix
varies for person and number, and the different forms are as follows:

no and 4) appearing between the possessed and the possessor. Structurally, nu is the head
of its own case phrase, which is composed of the article and a sister NP, the possessor.
The order of constituents is thus Head-(GEN-Dependent). This article, or rather its
allomorph u, may be cliticised onto the preceding noun; this u often replaces the final
vowel of the word. This is most common with words ending in a back vowel, a, o or u,
but can occur with any vowel. For example,

           CORE      chair=GEN             father-1SG.POSS
           “My father’s chair.’   This genitive article may also be used governing pronouns instead of the normal use of
possessive suffixes. This has the additional pragmatic force of emphasising the contrastive
identity of the possessor compared to other possible possessors. Compare (9a), using the
regular possessive suffixes, with (9b), employing a pronominal possessor in a separate
genitive phrase to mark the contrastive sense:   (9)     a.   Te _     kolikoli{-'u}poss.
                CORE     canoe-2SG.POSS

                “your canoe’   Additionally, the free pronouns are used when the possessed entity has exclusive
reference in the conceptual world. In this case, there is neither a genitive article nor a
possessive suffix, and the free pronoun is simply placed immediately following the
possessed object:   (10)    a.   Te       doe[-su]poss.

the information with a greater sense of individuation, rather like ‘our own special
language, and no-one else’s.’ The structure of a genitive case phrase is the same as the
structures seen in chapter 3, and an example is as set out in (12):      (12)                                    KP
    Unlike the core articles te and na, or the oblique article i, the genitive article nu has no
predicative function. Compare the following non-verbal clauses with core and oblique
predicates in (13) and (14), and the phrase involving the genitive nu in (15):      (13)     [Te        ia]xp      [te           mori)xp.

             ? ‘She, of my family.’Whilst both (13) and (14) have clausal interpretations (though (14) can also be interpreted
as a phrase modifying within an NP), this is not a possible option for (15), which can only
be interpreted as a KP containing a pronominal head modified by the genitive case phrase.
    A genitive KP cannot serve as an adjunct in a main verbal clause (though it may serve
as such in some relative clause types; see chapter 15 for details and examples), a
characteristic of oblique KPs and PPs. Compare (16) and (17):

distributional restrictions from both core and oblique articles. The form of the genitive
article is most typically nu (or its allomorph u); it can, however, especially in the speech of
people from the south western coast of Wanci, and those areas in the court of Lia, or those
with associations with Buton, be heard as no, probably modelled after the suffix -no that is
found in the languages of Muna and Buton (with the exception of Wolio, the Sultanate
language). For example, we find sentences such as (8)' in Muna (van den Berg 1989:86):    (8)'   —_ roo-no           Sau
             leaf-pos          tree
             ‘leaf of a tree; vegetable’    In these languages, however, it is clear that it is actually the possessive suffixes that are
used, and not a separate genitive case marker. Compare example (10b) with the following
Muna phrase (van den Berg 1989:85):    (10)     e.     guru-ku       inodi
                    teacher-my    I
                    ‘MY teacher’ (not yours).’   Clearly the genitive construction is treated differently in Tukang Besi, compared to the
Muna possessive construction. The genitive case marker is independent of person and
number of the possessor, and is not suffixed onto the head noun (Tukang Besi would
require te guru nu iaku as a translation of (ii), and not allow * te gurusu iaku). This is also
discussed in chapter 513.2.3       Internal structure of a genitive phraseFrom the examples above it can be seen that the appearance of a genitive phrase (or
possessive suffix) serving to modify a noun is obligatorily within a noun phrase. It can be
shown, however, that the NPs that may appear in genitive KPs are non-nominative, and
do not display the internal structure associated with nominative NPs. This can be
corroborated by the lack of ambiguity in strings that might be naively thought to be
ambiguous. Examine the KP containing a genitive case phrase in (18):   (18)      Jari       no-mohoo na                  paa       no        bonto      iso   ba’.

             ‘So that mentioned thigh of the ruler was sore.’
           * ‘So the thigh of that mentioned ruler was sore.’Here it might appear to be the case that the demonstrative string iso ba‘t occurs modifying
342     Chapter 13a nominative noun phrase, not allowed by the rules governing NP structure (see chapter
12). In fact this interpretation is not allowed, and the demonstrative can only be taken to be
referring to the NP inside the genitive phrase, and not the NP outside the genitive phrase.
This provides evidence that NPs within a genitive phrase are non-nominative, regardless of
the case of the KP in which they are found. This can be represented in the structure seen in
(18)’, which is contrasted to (18)"", not a possible constituent structure representing (18),
since it assigns a demonstrative choice that is only available to a non-nominative NP to the
nominative NP that is part of the outermost KP.","[363, 364, 365, 366, 367, 368]"
"15.6       Object relative clausesThe object relative clause is marked by the use of i- ( idiolectally and dialectally di-, ni)
prefixed to the verb. All core arguments in an object relative clause are optional, and, if
present, are indicated by possessive suffixes or genitive phrases attached to the verb. The
first of these genitive phrases usually refers to the by-phrase, but in combination with an
applicative suffix or a ditransitive verb this first possessive suffix position can mark
another argument of the verb:              Possessive marking by-phrase:

                relative clauses built on applicative constructions)Whilst somewhat clumsy, this label is an accurate description, in the English sense of an
object-oriented (i.e., passive) sentence describing the role of the argument in question.
Note that in Tukang Besi there is no main clause equivalent of the ORC, and so no tests for
determining the core or oblique status of these by-phrases, though the fact that they are
genitively linked to the verb rather than present prepositionally is indicative of core status.
Compare the marking of ‘him’ in (61) with its oblique status in the following sentence:      (61)'    Te         sintere      i-kahu        i       ia       o-saori-leama.
               CORE       torch        OP-send       OBL     3SG       3R-very-good
                ‘The torch that was sent to him is very good.’With many object relative clauses containing a verb with applicative morphology, there are
complications in the possibilities available for the reference of the possessive marking.
This is covered in Chapter 10:
     The verb in an object relative clause may not be further marked with either the -/um]-
infix or object suffixes, even if ditransitive:      (63)     O-koruo        na       mia           [i-hu'u)pc.

behaviour. Compare (64) with (64)’:      (64)'    O       sabo         ne-waa-kainta.

               ‘The soap that was given to us.’The object relative clause prefix can only be used with a head noun in [O] function, never
with those in an [S] function, even if the noun is semantically a Theme/Patient. If the
object prefix does appear on an ambitransitive verb, the verb can only be interpreted as
transitive:
                                                                      Relative clauses    381   (66)      *Te   = kene-su                   [i-mohoo)gc.

           * ‘The coconut that fell.’The argument that may enter into an object relative clause is generally the lowest ranked
one in its predicate. This is as follows:    (68)     (...... oe)
                     |
                   ORC
That is, the lowest ranked argument in a predicate is eligible to appear in this clause type;
no other argument may. A discussion of the exceptions that ditransitive verbs represent is
found in chapter 20.14.3.
     With a complex predicate, it is the outermost layer that is examined to determine
eligibility. This is illustrated with causative and applicative combined predicates:   (69)      ‘CAUS (I ],[ ] PRED({                 J,{ J)’
                                |                        0

15.6.1       Object relative clauses and applicative constructionsWith applicative constructions, the data for which have already been presented in chapter
10, the applied object may head an object relative clause in which the possessive suffix (or
equally the first genitive phrase, for a nominal; I shall include this under the term
‘possessive suffix’ here for the sake of brevity may (depending on the semantic role of the
applied object) indicate an argument other than the by-phrase, the normal reference of
these affixes. The arguments that may be indexed by possessive suffixes for applied object
heads of relative clauses (with theme/patient base objects) are shown in table 28:
382     Chapter 15                     Table 28. Object relative clause with applied object as head             Semantic role of APPLIED object:           Reference of possessive suffixes:

possessive suffix with the base object heading an object relative clause can indicate either
the by-phrase (in both cases), or the base object, the dative argument in (71), or the theme
argument in (72):      (71)    Te         poda_   i-hu'u-ako-su                   no-molengo.

clause verb, in many cases the base object of the construction may head an object relative
clause. In those cases, the options for the reference of the possessive suffix are determined
by the semantic role of the APPLIED object (not the base object), and are as shown in table
29:                       Table 29. Object relative clause with base object as head             Semantic role of APPLIED object:        _ Reference of possessive suffixes:

              (Good with the interpretation: ‘The elder that was asked about (by me) is
              sleepy.’)    Attempting to explain the asymmetries found in table 28, we note that only [Theme] or
(Locative] applied objects allow indexing of an argument other than the by-phrase. In
terms of the thematic hierarchy, this is a contiguous group of semantic roles:                   agent - dative - instrument - [theme/patient - locative]Furthermore, the arguments that may be indexed are in both cases the arguments that are
higher on the thematic hierarchy. In terms of the individual argument structures, the
possibilities of possessive indexing may be modelled as in (77) and (78). In these and
subsequent diagrams modelling the behaviour of relative clauses the arrows indicate the
possible reference of the possessive suffix:       (77)    ( [Agent], [Dative), [Theme] pL)
                     |          L__
       (78)   ({Agent], [Theme], [Location], ppy)                     ;           LH
     An applicative object in [Dative] or [Instrumental] role is placed higher on the thematic
hierarchy than the base object, which is a [Theme/Patient] (in most cases; see examples
(81) - (85)). If we posit a rule stipulating that the possessive suffixing on a verb in a
relative clause headed by an applied object may index any subcategorised-for argument
bearing a higher semantic role than the applied object itself, we can account for the failure
of applied objects bearing these semantic roles to index theme or patient base object. This
is modelled in (79):
384     Chapter 15
      (79)    ({Agent], (Dative/Instrument],ppy, [Theme]))                   Li              |            s2
                                                IN
    The data in table 29 concerning the details of object relative clauses headed by the base
object of an applicative construction can also be explained by the relative prominence of
arguments on the thematic hierarchy. A base object may head an object relative clause of
an applicative construction if and only if the applied object is higher than it on the thematic
hierarchy, or is locative. The possessive suffixes must index an argument higher on the
thematic hierarchy than the base object, but not an agent, unless the applied object is one
that could not be a core argument of a simple predicate (ie., locative). The models for
examples (73) and (74) are given as (73)' and (74)':      (73)'   <{Agent], [Instrument],
                                   pp, [Theme]))                   |               UL——
      (74)'   ({Agent], [Theme], [Location] ,ppz))
The ungrammaticality of a base object heading an object relative clause if it bears a
lower-ranked semantic role than the applied object can be explained in terms of the
unavailability of a higher non-agent argument. An example of this is given in (80):      (80)    ({Agent], [Agent] app., [Theme]}))                   —I
    This still leaves the question of the behaviour of base objects in applicative
constructions which are in [Dative] or [Instrumental] role, when the applied object is also
either [Dative] or [Instrumental]. If we examine a verb which subcategorises for an
instrumental object, and then has a dative applicative object added, we find the following
patterns of indexing in object relative clauses:      (81)    Ku-pake-ako     te       ina-su             te     kabali

              ‘The machete that was used for her...’Sentences (81) - (85) establish that [Dative] must be ranked higher than [Instrument] on the
thematic hierarchy (an assertion argued for by Bresnan and Kanerva (1989), but for which
they did not provide any supporting evidence). The ungrammaticality of (83) is due to the
fact that the dative applied object cannot index a lower-ranked instrumental base object,
modelled in (83)'. Sentence (85) owes its grammaticality to the fact that the dative base
object is higher on the thematic hierarchy than the instrumental base object, seen in (85)’:    (83)' * ([Agent], [Dative},pp., [Instrument]))                   LI                        |

    In summary, we can say that a base object may head an applicative relative clause if
there is an argument other than the [Agent] which bears a higher-ranked semantic role. The
possessive suffixes on the verb of the object relative clause headed by the applied object
may index either the agent or an argument bearing a higher semantic role than the applied
object.","[405, 406, 407, 408, 409, 410, 411]"

                                 Introduction1.1     SettingThe Tukang Besi language is spoken in the archipelago that bears the same name, the
Kepulauan Tukang Besi, east of the island of Buton in the province of Southeast
Sulawesi. In this area it is the main (and almost sole) language of everyday
communication. Administratively the archipelago is made up of four kecamatan
(sub-districts), Wanci, Kaledupa, Tomea and Binongko, each consisting of one main
island, and each except Binongko having a cluster of smaller islands, some inhabited, in
addition to the main island. These four kecamatan (sub-districts) are all located in the
Kabupaten (district) of Buton.
     In addition to these primary islands where the language is unchallenged there are many
monolingual and bilingual settlements of Tukang Besi speakers on other islands in
Sulawesi, Maluku, Nusa Tenggara and Irian Jaya, and large populations of speakers in
trading centres such as Baubau, Ujung Pandang, Surabaya, Jakarta, Banjarmasin,
Singapore, Ambon, Taliabu, Obi, Fakfak, Manokwari and Darwin. As well as the
members of the communities who are actively involved in trading many Tukang Besi have
become market gardeners (especially in the east), or construction workers (more in the
west), and producers of raw goods for their trading cousins. An account of a typical one of
these communities comes from Anceaux (1958: 112), writing about the linguistic situation
in the city of Fakfak on the Bomberai peninsula of Irian Jaya:      Fakfak, the principal town of the whole peninsula and its direct environs are
      inhabited by people from the adjacent language-areas but also by an important
      number of original Indonesians, mainly from the Moluccas (Ambonese,
      Ceramese, Keiese and a great number of Butonese), who for the greater part
      have given up the use of their original language and taken up Malay. Only
      amongst the Butonese groups one can still hear the original languages regularly
      used,...","[6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27]"
"3.2.4    NominativePhilippine-type languages present problems for the analysis of grammatical processes in
                                                          Syntactic units and the clause      49terms of [A], [S] and [O], and ‘subject’ and ‘object’. Analyses of these languages,
typically exemplified by Tagalog, have variously ascribed accusative syntax to them (eg.
Guilfoyle, Hung and Travis 1992), or ergative syntax (e.g. Byma 1986), or even as
displaying an essentially nominal character (eg. Starosta, Pawley and Reid 1982, Naylor
 1995 and the references therein). Maclachlan (1994) has shown that there is equal
justification for viewing the language as either ergative or accusative, depending on the
approach taken to morphological classification (though see Foley 1991b), and that Tagalog
is better treated as displaying characteristics of both of these categories. Despite this,
Tagalog does not absolutely belong to either of these camps, what Maclachlan calls the
 ‘hybrid’ hypothesis. Unlike languages with (predominantly) accusative or ergative syntax,
each clause in a Philippine-type language must morphologically SELECT one of the
arguments of a transitive verb as its pivot; there is no unmarked choice (or, rather, either
choice may be interpreted as equally marked); this analysis is thoroughly treated in
Schachter (eg., 1976, 1977) and Foley and Van Valin (1984).
     I use the term ‘nominative’ in a sense similar to that employed by Bell (1983) for
Cebuano and Kroeger (1993) for Tagalog to refer to the case that is assigned to that
selected argument in the clause, regardless of whether that argument is in [A], [S] or [O}
syntactic role. In previous literature on Philippine-type languages this pragmatic role has
been referred to as the “focus”, “subject” or “topic”. I use nominative to escape the other
associations that these terms carry, which can be shown (Kroeger 1993, and paragraph
3.2.3) to be distinct from the nominative pivot. Nominative is used in two senses, to refer
to the morphological case marker na, and also to refer to the unique grammatical function
that may be marked by the article na. The difference between these two uses of the term are
further described in section 3.8.3.","[74, 75]"
"3.11.1       Core argumentsThe arguments that may be indexed on the underived verb are limited. Without the addition
of applicative morphology, only arguments in [Agent], [Dative], [Instrument] or
[Theme/Patient] semantic roles may be indexed on the verb (if that verb’s subcategorisation
frame calls for an argument in that semantic role), and without the use of applicative
morphology only these arguments may be selected as the pivot in various constructions
(some grammatical constructions automatically select a pivot because of the particular
syntactic or semantic role that it bears, which is not a variable; see chapter 20). The fact
that a single semantic role (illustrated with [Dative]) may appear indexed on the verb as
either subject or object, depending on the verb’s subcategorisation frame, has already been
seen in 3.4.1. This point is exemplified in more detail in chapter 20, and the use of
applicative morphology is dealt with in chapter 10.
     We have seen that verbal indexing is an option only available for core arguments.
Further arguments that can be used to establish the special status of core arguments are:    °    core arguments are obligatorily marked by articles on their KP, whilst
         oblique nominals are often grammatical with just a preposition, dropping the
         oblique article i.
         (the verbal origins, and verbal characteristics, of some of these prepositional
         forms, are mentioned in chapter 4, and chapter 12. See chapter 12 for a chart
         summanising the differences in use of the prepositions and articles)         only core arguments may launch floating quantifiers (if nominative) or
         floating adverbs (if non-nominative);         only core arguments may be relativised, using the subject relative clause or
         the object relative clause;    °    in nominalised constructions, or if the verb is in an object relative clause,
         possessive suffixes or genitive phrases may only indicate the core arguments
         of the verb ;Andrews (1985: 82) writes that “One set of cases, commonly called ‘syntactic’ cases, code
the core functions”, and that “NPs with ‘syntactic’ cases tend to express a wide range of
semantic functions and to be targeted by rules sensitive to grammatical function”. The
evidence from Tukang Besi would support the conclusion that the articles re and na are
primarily used to mark core arguments.
    Examples of floating adverbs and floating quantifiers are given in Chapters 7 and 20,
respectively; it is shown there that they can be floated only with reference to a
76    Chapter 3(non-nominative or nominative, respectively) core argument. Nominalisation is also
covered in chapter 12, but some examples are given below. The basic verbal sentence is
presented in (90), and (91) is a grammatical nominalisation based on that sentence; (92),
on the other hand, which marks the oblique i wale wale as a genitive phrase in the
nominalisation, is not grammatical, offering an important point on which core and non-
core arguments differ:              Basic sentence:
     (90)     Noj-hu'u-aku;     te      boku, i              wale wale}.

              GEN _     shelter
              (Lit., ‘Did you see their giving of a book of me of the shelter?’)    The facts and restrictions of relativisation are covered in chapter 15, and do not need to
be enumerated here, since they correspond closely to the restrictions on nominalisations:
only and all core arguments may be indexed by means of genitive phrases.
    As well as the evidence from nominalisations, a second piece of morphosyntactic
evidence separates the putatively core arguments from the rest (the obliques), namely that
of case-marking options. The core arguments are the only arguments in these semantic
roles that can be marked with te or na without the need for derivational morphology, and
which cannot appear marked by the oblique case i (with the exception of [Cause], which
(in the case of the two verbs mo’aro ‘hungry’ and motindo'u ‘thirsty’) can be marked with
te. The cause NP does not, however, display any features that are normally associated
with core arguments marked by te; see section 3.8.2 for details). Additional (negative)
evidence for the special status of core arguments is that, when topicalised, an oblique
nominal keeps its original preposition or case marker, whereas a core nominal always has
te as its article, as illustrated in (93), showing an oblique KP topicalised, and still marked
with di, and (94), showing that a core KP uses te when topicalised.","[101, 102]"
"5.3.1    The status of verbal indexingIt has long been recognised that languages which index their arguments on the verb may
have more than just weak grammatical agreement operating. The pronominal indexing has
been identified by some as representing incorporated pronouns (amongst others, Boas
(1911), Bloomfield (1927, 1933), and more recently Van Valin (1977) on Lakhota, Jelinek
(1984) on Warlpiri (but see Simpson 1991), Pawley (1986) on Fijian, Bresnan and
Mchombo       (1987)   on   Chichewa,    and   Baker   (1991)   on   Mohawk).   Discussing   the
importance of verbal indexing in head marking languages, in which class Tukang Besi is at
least partly included (the fact that the object is only optionally indexed on the verb in
Tukang Besi makes it a less than perfect exemplar of the class), Van Valin (1993: 17-18)
writes that        ...with respect to clauses in head-marking languages, the pronominal affixes
        on the verb are the core arguments of the clause, not the optional
        independent lexical NPs and pronouns....What then is their [the independent
        NPs - MHD] status? Semantically, their function is to further specify the
        reference of the pronominal arguments, which specify only person (and
        sometimes number). Syntactically, they are clause internal...they are irrelevant
        to statements of grammatical phenomena, because these phenomena make
        reference primarily to the pronominal affixes.         (emphasis original)    In Foley’s (1991) description of Yimas, he asserts that the pronominal affixes in that
language are pronominal elements. He states that        In essence, the claim is that the pronominal affixes actually fill the argument
        positions of the verb and that any noun phrases filling what seem to be the core
        argument positions of the verb are actually only indirectly linked to it, by being
        in apposition to a pronominal affix which bears the same noun class, person,
        and number specifications as the noun phrase.                (p. 227-228)
124        Chapter 5
The arguments that he puts forward in favour of this interpretation in Yimas are also valid
arguments for treating the pronominal affixes in Tukang Besi as filling the argument
positions of a verb (at least some of the time). These arguments are:      1. Overt nominals are often not used in discourse, referents mentioned solely by
             means of their pronominal affixes                                        (p. 229-230);      2.     Pronominal affixes referring to nominals distinguish more number categories
             than do the nominal themselves                                           (p. 230-231);      3.     Even though an NP cannot be headed by two conjoined nominals, a
             pronominal affix can agree in number with multiple nominals (p. 185; 231);      4.     Human possessors can appear as core arguments marked on the verb, even
             though the corresponding nominal cannot appear as a core argument on the
             clause                                                                  (p. 231-232).
      Examining these points one by one for their validity as tests in Tukang Besi, we find
that the ellipsis of nominals in discourse is a regular feature of Tukang Besi narratives. One
traditional story recorded offers an example of a participant being tracked for seven lines
using pronominal affixes on the verb, without nominals, after the introduction of the
protagonist           in the   first line.   In (35a)    - (35i)   the   verbal   affixes    referring   to La
Kape'ingkape'i have a subscripted LaK to indicate their identity:      (35)       a.     La Kape'ingkape'i        iso        noyax-wila       no_ax-tunga-ntunga

                 ‘After that, La Kape'ingkape'i went up to his house.’In another text of twenty eight lines describing someone’s falling onto a stonefish, the
chief protagonist is never mentioned nominally, being assumed from the title, and is
referred to only through the use of verbal affixes. In the story of Wa Iambo (in the
appendices), only 70 core nominals appear in the text, plit approximately between 30
nominals in [S] function, 30 in [O] function, and 10 in [A] function, out of approximately
130 verbal clauses.
    The second point, that the pronominal affixes distinguish more number categories than
do the independent nominals, is as valid in Tukang Besi as it is in Yimas. There is no
indication of number in nominals whatsoever, yet there is up to a three way distinction in
number for the pronominal affixes (see 5 for details; Tukang Besi distinguishes singular,
paucal and plural in the first person, singular and plural in the second person, and makes
no number distinction in the third person).
    The third point, conceming the ungrammaticality of conjoining nominals to serve as the
head of an NP contrasting with the ability of the pronominal affixes to agree in number
with two or more NPs added together, also applies. In Tukang Besi sentences of the ‘old
men and women’ type are impossible, as seen in (36) (‘old person’ is a lexicalised item

necessary to mention two separate (conjoined) noun phrases, each with its own adjective:   (37)     Te      [[ama          mo‘owu]          kene       [ina             mo'owu)].

Despite this restriction, we find that two nominal heads of NPs can be referred to by a
single pronominal index on the verb:    (38)     To;j-wila   [na    [iakuj]jp   kene        [iai-suj]Np]Npi,-
            IPL.R-g0   NOM _ ISG           and        =: younger. sibling-1SG.POSS
            ‘My younger sister and I went.’This is, however, more likely a result of the fact that the verbal indexing can index the
person and number features of a whole KP, whereas conjunctions join NPs together, and
cannot be used to conjoin an N’.
   More significantly, we find that an empty NP may still be indexed on the verb (see
McCloskey and Hale 1984):    (39)   Kuj-wila [ [O)npi kene          [iai-suj)np]Npi-
           1SG-go                and _—s younger. sibling-1SG.POSS
           “My younger sister and I went.’In (39), unlike (38), there is no other representation of the first person singular argument
in the clause at all, and so the pronominal index must be thought of, in this context, as
being a full pronoun. Details of this construction are discussed in more detail in chapter 18.
    Finally, in chapters 7 and 20 data on the phenomenon of possessor ascension are
presented illustrating the fact that the inalienable possessor of an affected argument of a
verb may be indexed as a subject or object on the verb (using the normal sets of subject
and object affixes), whilst it may not appear as a nominal with core status in an equivalent
clause without possessor ascension. An example of this is seen in the grammatical (40),
with possessor ascension, and the ungrammatical (41):
                                   |
    (40)    O-ha’a       ‘u-sepa-aku             na        tolida-su               atu        la?

            “Why did you kick my cousin?’In (40) a possessor, present as the first person singular possessive suffix on na tolida, is
also indexed on the verb with the first person singular object suffix, and functions (for
various tests, including passivisation) as the object of the clause (see chapter 11 for details
on the interaction of external possessor with other grammatical function-changing
processes). In the equivalent sentence without possessor ascension, and so without -aku
as a suffix on the verb, the possessor may not be present in any way other than as a
possessive suffix or as a genitive phrase within another KP. In other words, the possessor
has a position in the argument structure of the verb only if it appears as an affix; as a
separate KP, as in (41), it has no argument position, and is ungrammatical.
    A problem with exclusively identifying the pronominal affixes on the verb as the core
arguments of that verb arises when we consider (as is illustrated in sections 3.4.1 and
128     Chapter 53.4.2) that, whilst subject prefixes are compulsory on the verb, object agreement is not.
We are thus forced to modify the assertion to the effect that these affixes MAY, but do not
have to, fill the arguments position of the verb; if an object suffix is not used, it does not
mean that the object position is not filled (as can happen in unspecified object deletion,
referred to in chapter 4), but that the subcategorisation requirement for an object is filled by
the appropriate object KP (see 3.4.2, and chapter 8), and is not left empty.
    In the case of objects, there is evidence that either an object suffix, or a KP, may
appear in the verb phrase, but not both (see chapter 8). Whichever of the two appears in
the VP is filling the argument position assigned by the verb’s subcategorisation frame,
necessarily pronominally in the case of the object suffix. When both an object KP and an
object suffix on the verb appear in a clause, the object KP is not a part of the verb phrase,
but is cataphorically linked to the object suffix. The nature of this linkage between the
nominal and the verbal affix can be shown to be more than just the weak agreement that is
found in languages such as English by looking at certain cooccurence restrictions, which
are best examined in the context of WH-questions.
    The fact that a nominative object (which has, necessarily, object agreement on the verb)
cannot be the focus of a question (as seen in (42) and (43)) points to the fact that the object
suffix is doing more than simply agreeing with the KP, or the KP with the object suffix
(see Bresnan and Mchombo 1987 for a discussion of similar facts in Chichewa):      (42)     (‘)U-‘ita      te         emai?
               2SG.R-see      CORE       who

               “Who did you see?’      The subject prefix in questions is not so easily handled; it allows for pragmatic focus IF
AND ONLY IF the verb is also indexed for the object (that is, if it refers to a non-nominative
argument). Thus an intransitive verb, which cannot be indexed for an object, is
ungrammatical with a pragmatically focussed subject in (normal clausal) place:      (44)   * No-mai_        na         emai      i        aba?
               3R-come        NOM        who       OBL      previous
               ‘Who arrived just then?’This is equally ungrammatical with a fronted subject:      (44)' * Te    emai no-mai_                   i        aba?

              ‘Who arrived just then?’The pragmatic focus required by WH-questions can only be grammatically expressed in a
cleft construction employing a relative clause (chapter 15), such as that in (45):      (45)     Te        emai       na         {rf[um]ato   i      aba)?
               CORE who       NOM.    arrive.SI             OBL    previous

verb; it may not be questioned in place, as in (47), if the verb is un-affixed for object. It
may be questioned in place only when there is object agreement morphology on the verb,
showing that the subject prefixes are not to be taken as always representing a pronominal
element:      (46)      No-nabu-‘e   (na     pandanga-su)               te        emai         i         aba?

             ‘Who dropped my spear just then?’As with (44) and (45), grammatical versions of (46) and (47) can also be made with cleft

Dahlstrom 1986: 196-197) accounts for the ambiguous interpretation of the verbal indices
as representing pronominal elements or simple agreement by stating that        Languages such as Cree, in which verb inflection functions as agreement if a
        lexical argument is used with the verb, and as an incorporated pronominal
        element when lexical arguments are omitted, are said to include an optional
        equation of PRED = ‘pro’ in the lexical entry of the inflectional material.","[149, 150, 151, 152, 153, 154, 155]"
"12.8    Semantic range of the different prepositionsThere are four different words that will be treated as prepositions here, although it is clear
that there is a continuum of grammaticalisation, with some forms being purely
prepositional, displaying no characteristics of other word classes, and others tending
towards the verb class to different degrees. The five different prepositions, and the oblique
case marker, are:            Form                               Semantic Range           apai                                Goal, endpoint

resemblance to other word classes; the other two prepositions, mina and kene, both show
at least partly verb-like behaviour and certain other non-prepositional functions. The
general oblique marker is the broadest in semantic range (see table 23). The prepositions
mina and kene can be plausibly related to existent verbs in the language, and another verb,
dei, bears a resemblance in form and meaning to the di variant of the oblique case article:           Form                         Verb                           Verbal Meaning           di                          dei                             ‘be left over’
           mina                        mina                            ‘have ever been at’
           kene                        kene                            ‘be together with’   It is evident that prepositions in Tukang Besi have a mixed origin. For two of the
‘prepositions’ mina, and kene, the verbal and prepositional forms are identical. The variant
of the general preposition di, though fully established in the language, probably owes its
origins to trade Malay di, but does nonetheless ahve a plausible verbal equivalent in
Tukang Besi. The allative preposition kua (ka in other dialects, and southern Tukang Besi)
is also likely to have originally come from trade Malay (ka). The verb ako, which has
undergone a great deal of semantic bleaching, though the core meaning does appear to be
‘do (something) for’, is a likely candidate for grammaticalisation as a preposition in the
future of the language. Ako is not discussed here, but rather in chapter 8, because it
governs a core KP (though not with quite the same freedom accorded to most verbs),

    The degree to which the prepositions resemble verbs in their behaviour is summarised
in table 24, which summarises various features that are associated with verbs, with the
serial verb ako, the conjunction/verb/noun kene, and with the different ‘true’ prepositions:             Table 24. Similarities and differences between verbs and prepositions                                                  Verb       ako         kene        mina   kua   apa

              when in their verbal function; the ‘verb-oid’ ako may also be used
              as a main verb, in which case it is treated as any other verb. In this
              table, I wish to concentrate on the unusual features it displays
              when used in a non-contiguous serial verb construction (see
              chapter 8). It is also discussed in section 12.12)12.9       Functions of the oblique phraseA prepositional phrase may serve in maximally three different roles in a clause, as a clausal
adjunct, as a predicate, or as a modifier within an NP. These different uses are illustrated
with the oblique case i/di in (77) - (79) serving as a general marker of static location in all
cases:              Introducing an adjunct:
    (77)      Ku-kede     {di    godegode)xp.
              1SG-sit       OBL     veranda                                 (G:54)
              ‘I am sitting on the veranda.’              Predicative:
    (78)      Te      ia      [di      godegode)p.
              CORE 3SG         OBL     veranda
              ‘She is on the veranda.’              Modifier:
    (79)      Ku-'ema       [te     wowine          [di      godegode)xp         iso)xp.
              1SG-ask       CORE    woman           OBL _    veranda             yon
              ‘Tl ask that woman on the veranda.’    The restrictions on the positions in a verbal clause in which an oblique phrase may
appear have already been described in chapter 3, and amount to a restriction against any
non-core arguments appearing within the VP, regardless of their status as prepositional
phrases or oblique case phrases.
    Despite being able to appear as adjuncts, predicates or modifiers, there are differences
324 Chapter 12in the range of interpretation that can be attributed to the different oblique markers in these
different usages, and restrictions on which functions the different oblique markers may fill.
For instance, i/di may be used as a marker of static location, as in (73) - (75), but may also
serve to mark the goal (allative location, recipient), and in some cases the source of
movement. The variation of semantic range and function that the different oblique markers
exhibit is summarised in table 25:              Table 25. Use and function of the oblique article and the prepositions                     general oblique case                           local prepositions         non-local

static location if it is used predicatively, and can only be interpreted as an ablative marker if
it is used to modify within an NP (with exceptions provided for by appositional phrases -
see 12.3). The range of use of apa and kene does not extend past their use as adjuncts.
Kene may appear in positions other than just adjunct, but is then interpreted as serving as a
conjunction. This is illustrated in (80), in which te mo‘ane kene wowine can only be
interpreted as having the structure shown in (80)', and not that displayed in (80)"":    (80)      Te       mo'ane        kene         wowine            no-wila.

     The manner in which an activity is performed may be indicated either by an
exclamatory clause (for further details see chapter 14), by nominalising the action and then
predicating it with an adjective, or by an adverbial construction, in which an uninflected
adjective or adverb directly modifies the verb, appearing directly after it. These last two are
illustrated here:     (73)    No-menti'i           na        tinti-'(a)        u          kumbou         measo'e   la!

              ‘The goanna ran fast.’    As has been mentioned, the adverb may, with syntactic restrictions, ‘float’ away from
its immediate post verbal position to appear anywhere within the verb phrase; this is
discussed in chapter 7.
                                                             Syntactic units and the clause   713.10.2         Noun Phrases
The fact that Tukang Besi needs to distinguish between the Noun Phrase (NP) and the
Case Phrase (KP) has already been foreshadowed. The argument for this is that the
paradigmatic roles that the constituent traditionally called the ‘NP’ plays in clauses can be
summed up as follows:           °   serve as a direct (core) argument of a verb;
           °
               be the unit replaced by a clause in a complement construction;
           °
               be the sister of a preposition in a preposition phraseIt is true that the first two of these functions are played by the one constituent in Tukang
Besi; compare the following two sentences:    (75)       Dinggawi   ku-'ita-'e      [na     Wa Darwin — r{um]ato)-:np°.
               yesterday 1SG-see-30BJ NOM WaDarwin             _arrive.sI

               ‘I saw Wa Darwin arrive yesterday.’However, when we examine the structure of a prepositional phrase, we find that an
oblique case article + NP constituent is not always the constituent that is the sister of the
preposition. In (77) mina takes a case article + NP sister, but in (78) the preposition kua

towards a person, as seen by the ungrammaticality of (78)':    (77)       No-rato    [mina   [i      Wa Darwin)xp ]pp.

            3R-go          ALL     OBL    WaDarwinFor this reason we need to recognise a larger constituent in Tukang Besi which consists of
the NP and its preceding case-marking article. The terminology for such a constituent
exists, proposed by Fillmore (1968), and used more recently by Lamontagne and Travis
(1987), Kroeger (1990) and others, as well as a long descriptive tradition within
(lexi-)case grammar. A NP that is preceded by a case-marking article is assumed to be
nested inside a Case Phrase (KP); when an NP appears without a case article, having only
a preposition preceding it, it is a simple NP. It is understandable that the oblique case
marker has come to be omitted following some prepositions, since the use of a preposition
already signals the nominal as oblique, and moreover more finely specifies the semantics
72 Chapter3
of the relation. We can hypothesis that a pre-Tukang Besi had only the oblique case i, and
that the other ‘prepositional’ forms are more recent additions to the language. mina and
kene are still used as verbs, and kua (southern variant ka) is clearly derived from Malay
ka. Only apa has no clear etymology, and this is the preposition that must appear with a
complete oblique case marked KP following it. The structures proposed for these two
phrases are seen in (79) and (80). The structure associated with a KP is that given in (79)
(details in chapter 12):                                              KP
                                   oO                                 ART                          NP                                           Read ima modifiers

                               ‘the big person.’A prepositional phrase with the preposition kua, which has as its sister an NP which does
not use articles, has an apparently nearly identical structure, seen in the putative tree for
(80), but this is only the result of a missing oblique article, as (80)' shows:                                                        PP

                                  ‘up to the big house.’From (80)' we can see that the PP takes a KP as its object; indeed, kua i wunua to'oge is
also acceptable, though more marked. We must conclude that some PPs unusually allow a
non-headed KP as the sister of the preposition; since a preposition already specifies the
non-core status of its argument, the oblique case marker is simply double marking of that
fact, and so in some cases may be dispensed with.
     The internal structure of the Noun Phrase is dealt with at length in Chapter 12; here I
will only mention that the NP is head-initial, and that some details of the structural
organisation of the NP depend on the pragmatic status assigned to the argument
(nominative case is explicitly marked by the choice of na or preverbal position, as the
article for the KP (all non-core NPs have the structure associated with a non-nominative
                                                                            Syntactic units and the clause   73NP)). The crucial aspects of this variation are the choice of demonstratives available at the
end of the NP, and the ordering of the constituents in the N' at the beginning of the NP.
The ordering of the two different types of N' constituents is as follows:    Nominative NP:                                        N'                                             N_   -POSS                ADJ

                                       N                ADJ

                              ‘My old house.’Further details on structural differences can be found in chapter 12.
    We can define the NP paradigmatically as the unit that may be replaced by a simple
pronoun or noun. Further, the KP or PP is a unit that, while it is somewhat mobile in the
clause, may not be broken up and its constituents scattered through the clause. Thus, the
head of the noun phrase may not be separated from its modifying adjective in (83) - (85):    (83)     Dinggawi no-mai_     [min(a) i     [Pada Kuru)np }pp

elements as well (though a quantifier may float away from its KP, giving the impression of
a stranded modifier, as in (85)':    (85)'    [Te      [kene-su]np }kp  no-mai-mo                       [dua-mia)Quantifier-

"In (18) tawatawa functions as the head of a noun phrase, its nominal character in this
clause clear from the article preceding it indicating that it is in a KP, and is the nominative
subject of the intransitive verb nduu ‘make noise’; tawatawa is not affixed to indicate
relative clause status, so we must assume it is the nominal head of the NP. In the next line,
given here as (19), tawatawa is prefixed with verbal subject-marking morphology, and
clearly serves as the intransitive verb in the clause whose subject is te ndongandonga ‘the
clanger’ / ‘the clanging one’. Similar precategorial behaviour is found with words
describing more permanent properties, such as leama ‘good’, which may function as a
predicate (Noleama, ‘S/he’s good.’), or a referential expression in a KP (te leama, ‘the
good (one)’, or the good(ness)’; the KP may refer either to someone or something
possessing this property, or to the property itself). With an adjective beginning with mo-,
such as molengo ‘long (time)’, the use of the lexeme in a KP requires less morphology
than the predicative use, since the fossilised mo- prefix is not retained in referential use:
te lengo, ‘the long (one)’, or the length’, compared with Nomopera ‘S/he’s short.’, but
* Nolengo. With adjectives with the fossilised ma-, the prefix is always retained when
referential (te mamuda ‘the comfortable (one)’/’the comfort’), and adjectives with me-
show variable behaviour: te langka / te melangka ‘the long (one)’ / the length’, and
Nomelangka.
   There do not appear to be many Jexemes that are always unambiguously either nouns

or verbs, but not both. Certainly (at least most) ‘nominals’ can occur in verbal positions,
without derivational morphology. Some verbs require overt derivation, using the
nominalising suffix -‘a, to appear as nouns. This is the case with ‘ita in (20) - (22):    (20)     Ku-[‘ita]        te        honda-'u.

fewer purely nominal lexemes than there are purely verbal lexemes; that is, a greater
proportion of words that would be classed as ‘nouns’ from an English perspective display
precategorial behaviour than do words which are more ‘verbal.’
    The best analysis is probably that there are some concepts which are, due to their
semantic content, explicitly verbal, and a (smaller) number of concepts that are more
nominal. The majority of forms, however, may function in either position in a clause, as
exemplified by tawatawa in (18) and (19). The cline between strictly verbal concepts and
(the less common) strictly nominal concepts may be represented as follows:             Verbal _        _                   Pre-categorial                   Nominal         ‘Ita               topa                 bose             wowine                   komba

continuum can be seen in examples (21) - (25), and the discussion underneath example
(33). Example (65) in chapter 12 shows the inability of kKomba to occur with the
nominalising suffix -‘a, and line 46 of the Wa Iambo text (the first text of those included in
the appendices) presents a natural discourse use of subject prefixes on an intuitively very
nominal concept, wowine ‘(be a) woman’. This ambiguous behaviour is partly explainable
by the fact that the subclass of non-agentive verbs in Tukang Besi is made up of verbs
whose meaning is ambiguous between ‘be STATE’ and ‘become STATE’. Thus mate

‘dead’, with third person subject prefixes, may mean either ‘S/he is dying’, ‘S/he died’,
or ‘S/he is dead’:    (31)    Jari     no-poso-mo_    na     ja        mo‘ane     iso,   O-,      no-mate-mo.

            “Well, they met each other, Monkey said “As for me,
            they are dead, my bananas aren’t living .”      (AK:37)With this breadth of meaning, one form being used to indicate both a state and a process, it
is less surprising that otherwise nominal lexemes can be used verbally; the extension of a
state of existence to a process of change follows from the semantic classes established by
the non-agentive verbs. An example of the functional reality of this ambiguity can be
illustrated anecdotally. Sitting in a canoe, with a Tukang Besi person in a similar canoe
within arm reach, both equipped with paddles but in very shallow water, such that the
canoes could be propelled without paddles if needed, I said to my companion bose! As a
putatively verbal form, it would be interpreted, by its lack of any subject prefixes, as being
an imperative used to a singular addressee, with the meaning ‘Paddle! (away)’. As a
putative nominal form, the absence of an article or verb would mean that it could only be
interpreted as the theme object of the verb give, thus meaning ‘(Give me your) paddle!’ My
idea was that if the lexeme bose was underlyingly verbal, the addressee should paddle
away; if underlyingly nominal, he should give me the paddle. His response was neither of
these; he hesitated, and then asked ‘Do you want me to paddle away, or to give you the
paddle?’, clearly unable to disambiguate the two interpretations of the (grammatical)
utterance.
     The concept of clear word classes is needed to describe the direction taken by many
derivational affixes; the suffix -‘a ‘nominaliser’ always derives a word that is a noun;
similarly, the prefixes he- ‘verbaliser’, hoN- ‘purposeful verbaliser’, and hoko- ‘factitive’,
amongst others, always unambiguously derive words that are verbs (see chapters 9 - 11
for more examples). Here, as in the lexicon, there are more unambiguously verbal
concepts than nominal ones. Even though there are more precategorial entries in the lexicon
than ones assigned to the classes ‘noun’ or ‘verb’, I will use the labels ‘noun’ and ‘verb’
to discuss their function in a particular syntactic frame, without necessarily claiming that
the word is specified lexically as being either noun or verb.
    With the closed word classes a greater proportion of the lexemes are more clear; ‘ulu,
for instance, is a classifier, and cannot be used as a head of a noun phrase, or verbally.
Some of these clear cases are listed below:

closed class can also, however, function as a member of an open class. Examples include:       CLASSIFIER-NOUN:                            ba'e         ‘counter for small round things’
                                                                ‘fruit; heart’       CONJUNCTION-NOUN:                           kene         ‘and, whilst’

between classes is, generally, a syntactically determined one, and not lexically specified.
With this in mind, the open word classes, consisting of nouns and verb (including
adjectives) will be discussed, followed by commentary on the closed word classes.","[112, 113, 114, 115, 116]"

position in this schema with respect to the verb root. It simply is infixed after the first
consonant following the subject prefix, regardless of that consonant’s morphological
identification. The location of the infix is thus dependant on morphological information
(location with respect to the subject prefix) and phonological information (the shape of the
morpheme to which it attaches (see chapter 2 for a discussion of this affix). For two verbs
(nde‘u ‘not want’, hu'u ‘give’) there is an irregularity in the application of the subject
infix. This is discussed in 2.4.1.
      The most affixed verbs that have been recorded in freely occurring speech have about
302     Chapter 11five morphemes total, such as (97). This is also the number of morphemes found in forms
involving a passive of an applicativised verb, or a causative plus applicative, or double

interesting in showing an incorporated object in a complex construction:      (97) _ ...ku-[m]epe-'ita-taria-‘a-ako-ko,...

Notice that (97) includes an incorporated nominal (itself a derived form: taria ‘Extra
sensory perception’ + -‘a ‘nominalising affix’) which is the base object of the causativised
hepe'ita. In total the verb contains six morphemes other than the root, counting the
incorporated nominal as one morpheme.
    At this point in time I have no further data on the productivity of combinations

extremely rare in texts. The argument structure representing (97) is given in (97)’:      (97)    REQ       ({Ag}4,   [Pt]; APPL (Ash, [Dat]; PRED [Agh, (Thm}2) )

       Noun phrases: core and oblique phrases12.1      Noun phrase structure and the case phraseIn Tukang Besi the basic NP appears inside a KP, since all NPs must appear either with a
preceding article or with a preposition (for certain obliques), sometimes both (some time
expressions violate this otherwise fast rule; see chapters 3 or 17). As described in chapter
4, there are four articles used to mark case relations: the nominative na, the non-nominative
core te, the genitive nu, and the oblique i/di. The genitive case nu, and other issues
concerning possession, are discussed in chapter 13, and do not feature here. Preposition
Phrases are described in the second part of this chapter, and the first part deals with NP
structure in general, and the properties of core KPs. These minimally consist of the head of
the NP, which is typically a noun (N), plus an article. A minimal KP is, thus, an article
followed by an NP headed in the N position, as seen in (1) and (2):    (1)      [Te    wowine}xp       pasi-mo         no-wila.
            CORE    woman           already-PF      3R-go               (TB:8)

            TOP     Wanci          not-yet | 3R-many         NOM_  study.at.unversity.SI
            ‘As for Wanci, there aren’t yet a lot (of people) who have attended university’             (the second KP na kumulia is NOT headed in the N position; indeed, it is
             not headed at all, and has only the subject relative clause (see chapter 15)
             following the article)    The minimal KP consisting of simply a noun and a preceding article exemplified above
may be expanded in several] ways, through modification by demonstratives, inalienable
markers, numeral, verbal or adjectival expressions. The relative ordering of many of these
elements is not totally fixed, being determined by case choice to some extent, and general
freedom of position as well. The demonstratives, however, are rigidly fixed to appear
following all other constituents in the KP. Subtopics that are relevant to the internal
constituency of the NP, and that are dealt with in other chapters, are those of Possession
(see chapter 13) and Demonstratives (chapter 6). Their role in NP structure wil! be dealt
with here, but not the details of their internal structure. Relative clauses, which play a large
role in NP structure, will also be dealt with here only as far as their place within the NP is
concemed, and their own structures and restrictions are left to chapter 15.
     At the other end of the NP to the Demonstrative position is the N’, which is also fixed
in the position beginning the NP, and consists of a fixed group consisting of the nominal
head, any adjectives, and any possessive suffixes. All of the other modifiers in the Noun
304   Chapter 12Phrase occur after the N'; there are no pre-head modifiers in an NP, and nothing in the KP
appears before the article. The choices available for the Demonstrative position depend on
the case of the KP as a whole, and there are two different internal structures for an NP,
again depending on whether the argument represented by the KP is nominative or non-
nominative. The basic non-nominative NP has an ADJ position before the -POSS; this is
the major distinguishing feature of this NP type over the nominative NP type, whose ADJ
position follows a -POSS, and one of the clear points of distinction between verbs and
adjectives. The following basic structures are attested:       KP               aa    ART       NP       ART              -=    na        (nominative)

"3.2.5    Semantic roles and the thematic hierarchyReference to (A] [S] and [O] syntactic roles, to subject and object, and to nominative or
non-nominative grammatical relations, is not sufficient to describe the syntactic processes
that are found in Tukang Besi. In addition to these, use will be made of a modified version
of the thematic hierarchy as set up by Bresnan and Kanerva (1989). Their version of the
thematic hierarchy assumes the following list of semantic roles, in an ordered hierarchy
(the choice of the label ‘thematic’ or ‘semantic’ is arbitrary; I shall refer to semantic roles,
since that is (I believe, perhaps mistakenly) the most wide-spread and unambiguous term; I
shall, however, continue to refer to the ‘thematic hierarchy’ as an ordered list of these
terms, since ‘thematic hierarchy’ is a term that has become established in the literature):        agent > beneficiary > goal/experiencer > instrument > theme/patient > locative    See Roca, ed., 1992, for many further works and bibliographies of works that have
used the thematic hierarchy as an explanatory tool. Important discussion on the use of
semantic roles in grammar can be found in Dowty (1991), and much earlier work on a
slightly differently ranked thematic hierarchy can be found in Foley and Van Valin (1984).
Bruce (1984) explicitly uses an early version of the thematic hierarchy as an explanatory
tool in his grammar of Alamblak, and Carrier-Duncan (1985) uses a version of it in a study
of derivational word formation.
    The workings of Tukang Besi grammar do not provide evidence for all these
50      Chapter 3distinctions. Since this grammar is intended primarily as a description of the workings of
Tukang Besi, only those divisions necessary for such are description are employed here.
The modified hierarchy referred to in this grammar is as follows, collapsing Bresnan and
Kanerva’s beneficiary, goal and experiencer into one position, here labelled ‘dative’ (since
it covers a lot of the ground occupied by traditional dative cases), and recognising that on
morphosyntactic grounds we cannot distinguish theme and patient, thus collapsing them
into ‘theme/patient’ (various other languages, notably those of the Caucasus and of
Polynesia, clearly do distinguish theme from patient. See Kibrik (1985), Chung (1978),
amongst others):                     agent > dative > instrument > theme/patient > locative    Various parts of grammar refer to the role that arguments bear on this hierarchy, and
the relative order of the different semantic roles in this hierarchy is also particularly useful
in explaining some facts of object relative clauses (chapter 15). Conventions that need to be
introduced with respect to the use of argument structure and semantic roles are the use of
empty square brackets ‘[ ]’ to refer to an argument whose semantic role value is not
specified or irrelevant to the discussion at hand, and the use of angled brackets ‘( )’ to
represent the list of arguments in a verbs subcategorisation frame. If a verb subcategorises
for oblique arguments, then they are represented in a separate list: ((CORE))
((OBLIQUE)). An example of this is one of the argument list for the verb kahu ‘send’:
‘send ([Agent] [Theme]) ([Recipient])’.","[75, 76]"

Tukang Besi, which have been described in the preceding sections, can be summarised in
the following structure. The evidence supporting an analysis with a VP constituent is
presented in more detail in chapter 7; existential and non-verbal clauses are covered in
chapters 14 and 18 in more detail.                                                       5°

    Even though some time expressions are marked by the oblique article, they may still
                                                                            Syntactic units and the clause   81occur here, despite locative obliques being excluded from this position. This can be seen in
the textual example below which includes a topicalised subject followed by a oblique-
marked time expression in a preverbal position:    (lll)   E           ikami   ana,        i          rondo          buka-'a        baaba-'a-no

              ‘Well as for us, on the night of the festival I went first three days and
            three nights...’           (Sin: 1)      One piece of terminology deserves some explanation. An NP is said to be ‘prominent’
if it either is the highest semantic role in its clause, or it is selected as the sole nominative
argument in its clause; if either of these conditions are met, then the NP is ‘prominent’. If
neither of these two conditions are met, then the NP is ‘non-prominent’. In formal notation
the conditions for prominence are thus:    (111)   Prominence condition:
            {{ ]...)                   or              (...{.       ]...)
                                                             |
                                                           NOM
    Later it will be argued that in fact nominative status is the result of being the sole
argument of a predicate that is combined with the base predicate, and so we can think of
the prominence condition as being, on a more abstract level, simply an NP being the
highest semantic role in its outermost predicate, which only takes a single nominal
argument; a lexicalist representation of this is given as (112):    (112) [       LCS      Voice ‘nominative                    ({ ],ARG)Y           |

                                       TERMS ({ ],[ ])In the event of two arguments in one predicate sharing the same relative prominence on the
thematic hierarchy, then there must be a decision on the speaker’s part as to their relative
(perceived) prominence. This is only necessary in constructions involving the addition of
the comitative applicative suffix -ngkene, described in chapter 10.2.

                                         Word classes
4.1         The term ‘word’The concept of the ‘word’ may be defined either phonologically or grammatically. If
grammatically defined, the relevant criteria may be either paradigmatic or syntagmatic.
Paradigmatically, a word may be replaced by other words, whether it is nominal or verbal,
assuming that the result is grammatical from the point of view of the other levels of the
grammar. Syntagmatically, it moves in the sentence as a unit, and may not be divided.
These are the same criteria that were used to establish the existence of Noun Phrases, Case
Phrases and Verb Phrases.
    Problems specific to the question of the ‘word’ mainly centre around the difference
between the grammatical and the phonological word, and the fact that processes of
language change have led to some parts of the lexicon moving between word classes,
leading to problems in an absolute interpretation of the data. At the same time a root may
display properties that define it as belonging to one word class, but another set of criteria
would place it in another. This is apparent in Tukang Besi when we look at contiguous
serial verb constructions.
     Paradigmatic replacement can be seen in the following sets:      (1)      Ku-manga        te        osimpu.
               1SG-eat          CORE     young.coconut
               ‘I ate the coconut.’      (2)    | Ku-manga_        te       kaujawa.
               1SG-eat          CORE     cassava
               ‘I ate the cassava.’      (3)      Ku-hengolo       te     kaujawa.
               1SG-boil         CORE cassava
               ‘I boiled the cassava.’      (4)      Ku-hengolo-'e        na      kaujawa.
               1SG-boil-30BJ       NOM _ cassava
               ‘I have boiled the cassava.’    Syntagmatic coherence is exemplified by the fact that kaujawa ‘cassava’,
etymologically clearly a compound based on kau ‘wood’ and jawa ‘Java’ (that is, Javanese
wood), cannot be split up and spread about the sentence, or even the noun phrase. As a
whole word, however, it may appear in a noun phrase with either of the articles, and move
within the clause:
84      Chapter 4        (5)       Ku-manga_              te         kaujawa.
                  1SG-eat                CORE       cassava

                  1SG-eat-30BJ           NOM _      cassava
                  ‘I ate the cassava.’     (7)          Te        kaujawa            ku-manga-'e.
                  CORE      cassava            1SG-eat-30BJ

                  CORE      cas-         1SG-eat-30BJ          -sava
                  ‘I ate the cassava.’     (9)        * Ku-manga-'e            na         kau      = koruo jawa.
                  1SG-eat-30BJ)          NOM        cas-       many    -Sava
                  ‘I ate a lot of cassava.’    Furthermore, there are (as has been seen in chapters 2 and 3) differences in the
phonetic rules that apply to two identical vowels not of the same morpheme, depending on
whether they adjoin across a morpheme boundary within the same word, or across a word
boundary. In (10) and (11) the existence of a phonetic glottal stop between wila and ako
depends on whether or not the two morphemes occur in one word, or with a word
boundary between them:     (10)        No-wila           ako         te          ina-no.

                 3R-go-APPL      CORE mother-3POSS
                 ‘They sent their mother.’
                 [, noBila?a'ko te i'nano] ~ [,noBilaa‘ko te i‘nano]     The shift in accent is due not to the placement of the word break, but the fact that in
(11) te inano is under the same VP node as nowilaako, whereas in (10) te inano is in the
same node as ako, but not the same as nowila. See chapter 3 for a discussion of the
implications of this for phrase structure.
    In the case of identical vowels coming together across a word boundary the two
vowels either merge or show no special phenomena. If the same morphemes come together
within the word, a glottal stop is frequently inserted between the two vowels (see chapter 2
for more discussion).","[105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 110]"
"12.3       NPs not headed in the N positionIn addition to the NPs described above, there are NPs with reduced ranges of
modificational possibilities; these are all NPs in which there is no N constituent; rather, the
constituent immediately following the article is from one of the categories of the NP other
than noun, pronoun or common name. The NP takes an assumed generic ‘noun’ as its
understood reference, as in (29):
    (29)      [Te       [On _ [to'ogelaps Ike.
              CORE           big
              ‘The big one.’This is a common pattern found in Tukang Besi, with adjectives, relative clauses, numeral-
classifiers and demonstratives (actual, not referential) appearing immediately following the
article. Examples of the other possibilities are given in (30) - (32):             Relative clause

               ‘I don’t want to eat that.’     The restrictions on modification of an NP not headed by an N are that only a modifier
that would follow the first element in the NP in the ordering of a headed NP is allowed to
serve as a modifier. For instance, with a demonstrative as the first element in the NP, no
further modification is possible, because a demonstrative occupies the final position in the
NP structure:      (33)   *[Te       iso          to'oge-su   i-sai-su)kp                    di        ‘umpa?

               ‘Where is that big one of mine that I made?’This means that a relative clause can be modified by a demonstrative, a
numeral + classifier, another relative clause, or a combination of these, but not by an
adjective:      (34)     [Te    [t{umJinti]pc (dua-mia]nc         iso|xp te                     an{a)   u        emai?

               “Where is that big one of mine that I made?’     Similarly, a numeral + classifier may not be followed by an adjective, but does allow a
relative clause to follow it, or a demonstrative:      (36)     Nu-‘ita-'e               [na      [dua-mia]j-c        [k{umJanalako        te        bawa)rc

               ‘Did you see those two who were stealing the onions?’    Adjectives may be modified by almost the normal range of possible modifiers, but do
not allow for an adjective following, since that position allows maximally one member in
an NP, and is already occupied. In order for an adjective to modify another adjective, it
must be treated as a normal verb and appear in the relative clause position, as seen in (38):      (37)   * Ala-'e         [na       [mombaka]apy        _ [to‘ogelapy xp!

312     Chapter 12      A caveat needs to be added to this discussion of apparently non-headed NPs; in several
cases, a relative clause has become lexicalised as a noun, a unit that thus can fill the N
position of an NP. This point can be proven by the fact that it is capable of the full range of
modificational possibilities, such as (as illustrated here) a following adjective. If (42)
actually had the structure presented in (42)', the adjective would appear following the
relative clause, something that would have to be stipulated as possible for this (and a small
set of other) relative clause, but not others. If we assume that the relative clause has
become lexicalised, then it obeys all the phrase structure rules assumed to operate on all
NPs. The same argument applies to (43) and (43)':                Lexicalised headless relative clause:
      (42)      Maka        no-rato     [na     [mbeaka              i-‘ita]n    [ja'o] aps Ixp.

"Chapter 8: Serial verb constructions     Conceivably more than one verb can appear, preferably at different layers of the
     cause. For instance, (i) has a contiguous serial verb construction, as well as an
     additional non-contiguous one:
     (i)     [[No-[tu‘o]y-[ngkene]y      te        kene-su           te     kau)vp
             3R-chop-accompany           CORE      friend-iSG.POSS   CORE   tree

              INSTR     CORE     axe     sharp
            ‘He, with my friend, chopped the tree with sharp axes.’
     This can be shown to be a complement, and not a serial verb construction, by the
     placement of the negator mbeaka, which may appear in a complement clause, as in
     (i), but may not intrude in a serial verb construction:
     (i)    Ku-hada     (mbeak(a)    o-mohoo)complement-
            1SG-want not                 3R-sick
            ‘I want her to not be sick.’
     The sentiment is expressible either in a serial verb construction or a complement
     construction:
     (i)    Mbeaka_     ku-[hada)-[mohoo]
            not         1SG-want-sick
            ‘I don’t want to be sick.’                or
     (ii)   Ku-hada      [mbeaka    ku-mohoo).
            1SG-want not             1SG-sick
            ‘I want that I am not sick.’
     Object suffixes on the verb of the second clause in (11) would leave a nonsensical
     reading of ‘Their mother went to the market and they did (it) for her’, under the rules
     of cross-clausal deletion. See Chapter 3 for an introduction to the constraints on
     cross-Cclausal zero-anaphora.

2.    Making the subordinate verb passive is not an option; the derived subject of a passive
      verb does not gain the ability to be controlled by the subject of the main clause:
      (i)    * Nu-nde'u           (nu-)to-hu'u.
               2SG.R-not.want     2SG.R-PASS-give
             ‘Don’t you want to be given it?’
3.    How to Say this?:
      (i)      Mina      nggai     ku-'ita-'e,           no-elo          te      ia          na       kalambe.

4.    How are these concepts expressed? Qualifiers may of course appear in the KP, and
      simply not float; coreferential deletion simply doesn’t work, and the KP needs to be
      mentioned again:
      (i)      Ane ke boku i wawu meja i aba; meana’e te                     boku      iso         nobutimo.
                                                      CORE                   book      yon
5.    Though the owner of something may be the head of a relative clause:
      (i)      Te        mia         [umJane_      ke        kolikoli.
               CORE      person’     exist.SI      and       canoe
               ‘The person who has a canoe.’
6.    This would be expressed as (i) Dinggawi ala‘a                      no-wande,
                                      yesterday just                     3R-rain
7.    This is the case in most languages with a split-intranistive system. Other languages,
      such as Lamma (Timor—Alor—Pantar family, own fieldnotes) group unergative subject
      ({Sa]) with [O], and unaccusative subject ({So]) with [A]. Kolana, of the same
      family, has a split-intransitive system, but one in which none of the three ways of
      expressing the intransitive subject are the same as that used to indicate the [A] (own
      fieldnotes, thanks to Johanna Nichols). Choctaw (Davies 1986) also shows a three—
      way split in the verbal indexing of intransitive subjects, and several Dagestanian
      languages show three different patterns of case-marking on the subjects of
      intransitive verbs. The most common form of split intransitive system, however, is
      that exemplified by Eastern Pomo (McLendon 1978).

               ‘The child is running.’               Intransitive, non-active:

               3R-fall       NOM         child
               ‘The child fell.’As illustrated in examples (1) to (3), any NP referring to a core argument is obligatorily
preceded by a core article. If the argument is known, given information, and pragmatically
prominent, it may be assigned nominative case, and is marked with the nominative article
na (with variant a, glossed as ‘NOM’). Only one argument per clause may be nominative;
52      Chapter 3other core arguments, not selected as filling the nominative position in the clause, are
marked with the general non-nominative core article te (with variants ‘e and e, CORE’).
This is also the article used when a core argument is fronted (either clause-internally or
topicalised), so it is perhaps better to call it the ‘other’ article; core argument other than the
nominative, argument other than the post verbal ones. Here it is glossed as TOP when
marking, along with a near-obligatory pause, a topicalised NP, and CORE when marking a
core argument that is within the clause but not in nominative case. For the apparent
‘objects’ of the verbs mo‘aro and motindo'u (see section 3.8.2) the CORE gloss is used,
rather than introducing a third gloss for this use of the article.
           The unit that is made up of the article and the NP is referred to as the case phrase
(KP, see section 3.10.2 for a discussion). Notice that the agreement on the verb does not
indicate semantic roles directly; the agreement markers index the [S,A] argument and the
[O] of the verb respectively, regardless of the semantic role borne by the argument to
which the affix refers. This is demonstrated by the same prefix being used for both the
agents in (1) and (2) and also for the patient in (3), thus grouping the single argument of an
intransitive verb with the agentive argument of a transitive verb together in the same
relation for the purposes of verbal indexing. Notice also the following examples (4) and
(5), in which a Dative role may appear either prefixed or suffixed on the verb, depending
on the grammatical function that it serves:               Dative role prefixed as subject:
     (4)       Ku-‘awa-'e      na         pandola.
               1SG-get-30B)    NOM        eggplant
               ‘I got the eggplants.’              Dative role suffixed as object:
     (5)      Ku-hoti-‘e            na       ana     kilua.
              1SG-donate-30B)       NOM      child   _half.orphaned
               ‘I gave (food and clothing) to the child one of whose parents is dead.’    This point, the non-equivalence of semantic roles and verbal indexing, is illustrated in
more depth in chapter 20. While it may seem overly cautious to make the point here, the
relevance of semantic role information in other parts of the grammar renders this
assumption non-trivial.","[77, 78]"
"20.14       SummaryThere is no one unified concept of the pivot in Tukang Besi, in the sense that one set of
grammatical relations is the pivot for all constructions in the language. Even discounting
the fairly universal pivot that seems to apply for imperatives and some Equi constructions,
there is more than one pivot in Tukang Besi which a grammatical process can refer to, and
often an argument is the pivot for some processes, but at the same time not for others. The
labels “ergative’ and ‘accusative’ cannot be applied to the whole of Tukang Besi in any
meaningful sense, only to individual grammatical constructions.
     Perhaps more importantly, the notion of pivot in Tukang Besi is one not just based on
one set of criteria. Languages such as English or Yup'ik Eskimo (Payne 1982), and many
more, may all be characterised as having pivots based on syntactic categories (hence the
use of the labels [A], [S] and [O], referring to syntactic roles). Typically, the language has
either an [S,A] pivot, or an [S,O] pivot, though some languages refer to both of these for
different processes (such as several Mayan languages; see Craig 1977, Day 1973, England
1983, Bear 1992). Other languages, such as Archi (Kibrik 1979) or Aceh (Durie 1985,
1987, Foley 1991b) appear to refer to the semantic roles directly, without the need to
mediate these by means of syntactic roles (or grammatical functions, such as ‘subject’ and
490   Chapter 20‘object’). Yet others, notably those of the Philippine group, have a stronger orientation
towards the direct encoding of pragmatic prominence, and do not operate directly in terms
of either syntactic roles or semantic roles (Thai appears to be a language with a pragmatic
pivot, but with no morphological coding of the pivot choice.).
     The pivots in Tukang Besi, however, are divided amongst those that are based on
syntactic roles, those based on pragmatic factors (i.e., set by discourse constraints, with a
fair degree of freedom), and those that are dependent on semantic roles directly, regardless
of their syntactic status. Additionally, the existential construction presents a mix of
properties from several of these types, none of them as complete as a ‘normal’ verbal
clause presents.
     In short, whilst the labels [A], [S] and [O] are useful shorthand in a description of a
language such as Tukang Besi, they are not sufficient, and moreover, as has been seen in
sections 20.14.1 - 20.14.3, these syntactic roles are actually predictable for a given clause
if we know the subcategorisation frame of its verb. That is, given the argument structure
representation of semantic roles in the predicate, the syntactic roles [A], {S] and [OJ are
derivable concepts. The assignment of nominative case does not follow from any automatic
process similar to the assignment of the [A], (S] and [O] syntactic roles, but is similarly
based on the information present in the thematic hierarchy and thus the subcategorisation
frame of the verb. Some processes, notably the ability to head an Instrumental relative
clause, are sensitive only to semantic role information, and not to syntactic role
information. We must, therefore, look past the labels [A], [S] and [O], the grammatical
relations ‘subject’ and ‘object’, and the Philippine-style notions of nominative and non-
nominative arguments, if we are to economically describe the full range of grammatical
processes that are operating in Tukang Besi. Realising that all the processes are easily
explainable in terms of the relative ordering provided by the thematic hierarchy, we can
propose one underlying system that accounts for the large range of different groupings of
arguments that are accessible to different grammatical processes in the language.

"With (most) ditransitive verbs, or verbs with applicative or other valency increasing
morphology, all the core arguments may be mentioned in this manner. Though more than
one or two are unlikely to occur in natural speech, since the lack of strict rules on the
position of arguments in different syntactic roles makes it difficult to interpret these
sentences (such as the ambiguity of (67), in which Wa Ode Kiradati is not unambiguously
identified as either the see-er or the seen). An example of several genitive phrases on one
nominalisation can be seen in (68):    (68)    Te       pa-manga-'a-(')(u)              u           Aswi    nu    tka        atu,

            ‘Hey, the way you fed the fish to Aswin, it didn’t look easy.’Conceivably the nominalisation in (68) could be interpreted as “Your feeding of Aswin to
the fish’, but this is pragmatically rather unlikely. With ditransitive verbs, whether of the
({Ag], (Dat), [Thm)]) type or the {{Ag), [Instr], (Thm/Pt)) type (see chapter 4), all
arguments may appear in the nominalisation, though the instrument is unlikely to appear
without the theme/patient appearing as well:    (69)   No-(ita      te         tompa-'a-n(o)           u        Aswi   nu         watu.

as a bare noun phrase, or even with verbal morphology. Examples can be seen in (72) -

             “You’ve got such a thick beard!’12.7         Structure of the prepositional phraseA prepositional phrase is a non-nominative NP or KP preceded by a preposition. It is
typically used to introduce adjunct arguments that are not subcategorised for by the verb.
In addition to this, predicative uses (as illustrated in chapters 3 and 14) are also common.
A prepositional phrase may also be used as a modifier in an NP, though not all
prepositions enter equally into all these possibilities (see section 12.9).
     The reasons for considering prepositions and articles as separate word classes are not
unproblematic, since many prepositions can appear with a bare NP, rather than a KP. In
this respect they may be seen as having the same structure as a non-nominative KP, as
described in 12.1. This is illustrated in (75):      (75)         a.          KP                                        b.        “PP”

have variants in which the sister of the preposition is a case phrase, not an apparently bare
NP; this is never an option for the case markers na, te, i or nu: Most of the possible article
+ article combinations are internally inconsistent: i cannot combine with te or na, since i is
oblique, and both fe and na are core articles. Similarly, na and te cannot combine because
na marks nominative case, and te the non-nominative one. Combinations with the genitive
article nu are plausible, but disallowed. Unlike the other combinatorial possibilities, the
restriction must this time be one of phrase structure constraints (KP — ART NP, but
PP — P KP(/K)), rather than functional clashes.      (76)         a.         *KP                                             b.          PP

bare NP complement, and sometimes an oblique KP complement, This may be
functionally explained as removing the double oblique-marking on the NP; since a
preposition is inherently oblique, it is unnecessary to further specify the NP as oblique
with an oblique case marker. We can then reanalyse the PP in (75b) as being a P + KP,
with an empty article position, rather than a P + NP:     (76)             b.'             PP

                                                  head and modifiers     This is an important difference in phrase structure between a case phrase and a
prepositional phrase, and evidence for their separate status. Another difference between the
articles and the prepositions is the fact that the articles na, te and i can appear with
arguments bearing a much wider range of semantic roles than any of the prepositions. The
range of use of each of the prepositions, and the three clause-level articles (the genitive
article nu is left out of this table since it can never serve a predicative or adjunct function in
the clause), is set out in table 23 (the general preposition di / i has a wider range, but the
existence of applicative morphology that creates core arguments out of otherwise oblique
ones means that the articles te and na have a much greater range (the ‘extended use’ in table
21) than does di /i.).","[345, 346, 347]"
"12.2      KPs with an NP headed in the N positionAn NP may be headed in the N position by a common noun, names or personal pronouns.
The only effect that the different heads have on NP structure is that a pronoun or proper
name may not be modified by a (-POSS) or a prepositional phrase. Other modification by
adjectives, numerals and classifiers,! demonstrative, relative clauses etc. is allowed, within
the limits of NP structure described above. Examples             (4) - (6) show NPs with these
different sorts of heads:             Common Noun

              were really good looking, you know! They came bringing eggplants.’      Whilst some of the categories such as relative clauses allow for repetition, others,
namely adjectives and demonstratives, may only occur once in an NP. So, for instance,
(22) is not grammatical:      (22) * Di           ‘umpa?     — {na__ana{-su]poss                (to'ogeJapy         —[kandala],py )xp.
              OBL         Q              NOM      child-1SG.POSS __ big                     blind
              “Where is my grown-up blind child?’In order to express this meaning, one of the adjectives must be used as a verb, in the
relative clause position, with a subject infix, as is necessarily encountered with all subject
relative clauses (see chapter 15):      (23)    Di      ‘umpa?       [na         ana{-su]poss       [to'ogelapy     — [k{umJandala]gc |p.
              OBL     Q            NOM         child-1SG.POSS _   big                 blind.sI
              “Where is my grown-up blind child?’Normally, if a sole adjective is used in the relative clause position with the subject infix, it
acquires a superlative meaning. This is not the case if it follows another adjective, as in
(23) above.
    Apparent doubling of demonstratives may occur in some sentences, such as (24) in
which iso immediately follows ito:      (24)    Te      kalambe        ‘fumjita   te      kadadi i         kau                     ito

              iso     no-koni.
              yon     3R-laugh
              ‘The girl who’s watching the bird up in the tree is laughing.’This is only superficial, however, as the demonstrative ito is in the KP of the relative
clause, modifying kadadi, and only iso modifies kalambe:      (24)'   [Te kalambe (‘fumJita [te [kadadi)y {i kau)pp [itolpem Iker )rc [isolpem Ike
It is, however, unusual to have two demonstratives appear next to each other in this
manner.
      Notice that the order of adjectives and possessive suffixes on the two different types of
NPs is fixed; a non-nominative NP, for instance, cannot be modified by an adjective
following a possessive suffix:

"4.5.2      Intransitive verbsIntransitive verbs can be split into those that take agentive arguments as their sole
arguments, and those that take non-agentive arguments. The non-agentive verbs may be
either experiencer or theme/patient verbs. Into the latter category fall the subclass of
adjectives, and the overlapping class of ambitransitive verbs, dealt with later.
    The adjectives that may not appear with object-suffixes, exemplified by to‘oge in table
4, and thus are not ambitransitive verbs, have a simple subcategorisation frame that allows
only a patient:                         to'oge ((Pt])     ‘big’Other adjectives with this subcategorisation frame include the following:
100     Chapter 4

mendaro ‘deep’, mombaka           ‘delicious’.
      The subclass of verbs must have a experiencer as subject. Some of these verbs may
optionally take an oblique argument, marked by either the article i or te:      (78)   No-motindo'u           te          uwe      nu         osimpu.

             3R-surprised-30B]     NOM _ elder.sister-1SG.POSS
             ‘They surprised my older sister.’These verbs have the following subcategorisation frames:                     motindo'u          _ {[Dat)], ((Cause]))           ‘thirsty’
                     monimpala_            (Dat), ({Source]))           ‘feel homesick, miss ’
                     mente                 (([Ag]), [Dat]nom)           ‘surprised’There are very few verbs with this type of subcategorisation frame.
    Agentive intransitive verbs subcategorise for one argument:                     wila    ([Ag]) ‘go’Other agentive verbs with this subcategorisation frame include the following:
                                                                                                Word classes   101

                         tinti                    run    Some non-agentive verbs have alternate subcategorisation frames in which the single
argument is an [Agent], not [Patient]. This is found with verbs denoting a voluntarily
induced state, such as moturu ‘sleep.’ The [Agent] interpretation is a rather marked one,
and usually not the first interpretation that speakers will assume. The subcategorisation
frames for moturu are as follows:                    moturu          ([Pt])   ‘sleep’
                    moturu          {[Ag)) ‘goin order to sleep’Note this contrast in the sentences (82) and (83):           [Theme]:
    (82)   No-moturu         kene            wowine       ane         ke        hotu—           mopera.

            (i.e., they were asleep near each other.)
            ( # they had sex together)           [Agent]:
    (83)   No-moturu-ngkene             te       wowine         ane        ke           hotu.       mopera.

            (i.e., they had sex together)
            ( * they simply slept near each other without activity)Sentence (82) uses the conjunction kene (on an ‘empty’ NP; see chapter 18) to show an
additional sleeping participant of the activity; the [Patient] interpretation is the only one
possible. In (83), however, the [A] of the verb must be an [Agent], because of the addition
of the -ngkene applicative suffix that requires an [Agent] in the subcategorisation frame of
the verb, and so the non-agentive interpretation is not allowed. The analysis that this
agentive meaning of moturu is lexicalised, rather than an alternative case frame, can be
countered by the fact that in Tukang Besi the verb moturu ‘sleep’ also has a range
extending over ‘lie down, rest’ (as in Indonesian tidur ‘sleep’); in pa-moturu CAuS-sleep
‘put to sleep’, the meaning is not of knocking someone out, but of laying a person down in
order that they can sleep. I argue then that in addition to ‘sleep, lie down, rest’, ‘have sex’
is also part of the range of the lexeme.
     With a verb denoting a state that is NOT voluntarily induced, this agentive interpretation
102     Chapter 4is not allowed, as seen by the ungrammaticality of suffixing -ngkene to the verb (which
would require an agent argument):                 [Patient]:
      (84)        No-turu            kene   wowine     ane     ke      hotu—  mopera.

involving a recipient and a theme; see also the simbi subclas of transitive verbs described
in 4.5.1) behaviour, hu‘u ‘give’, sumbanga ‘donate (money)’, and kahu ‘send’. All three
differ in some ways with regard to their subcategorisation frames; most radically,
sumbanga is a loan word, and speakers vary in their treatment of its arguments. Since
there is no consensus about its grammatical treatment, and no prescriptive norm,
sumbanga has not been considered here. Of the other two ditransitive verbs, hu’u has only
one subcategorisation frame, which is also found for some occurrences of kahu:
                          hu'u        {{Ag], ((Dat]), ({Thm]))   ‘give’In this frame both the dative and the theme arguments are specified as optional; one of them
is, however, required. Thus (86) and (87) are both grammatical, but (88) is not:      (86)       No-hu'u-aku.
                 3R-give-1SG.OBJ
                 ‘They gave me (something).’      (87)      No-hu'u          te      doe.

             3R-give
             ‘They gave (someone) (something).’    With kahu ‘send’, the same frame as for hu'u may be used, specifying three core
arguments, or alternatively the following may be used with only two core arguments, and
one oblique one:                          kahu        [Ag], ((Thm])) ({Dat])     ‘send’Similar to the restrictions found with hu’u, the frame specifies two optional arguments, in
                                                                              Word classes    103
this case the theme and the locative; one, however, is required, making * nokahu ‘They
sent’ an ungrammatical sentence on its own. Compare the following sentences, the first
using the ({Ag], [Dat], [Thm]) subcategorisation frame with three core arguments, the
second using the ([Ag], ({Thm])) ([Dat]) frame. With the first frame, both the Dative and
the Theme objects are marked as core arguments, but only the Dative object may be
indexed on the verb. In the second sentence, the Theme is the object that determines the
object suffixes on the verb, and the recipient is present as an oblique argument; it may not
be marked by the core article te:               ({Ag], ((Dat]), ({Thm]))
    (89)      No-kahu-aku       te     doe            te       kene-su.

processes such as passivisation and relative clause formation are applied; with the first
frame, the recipient may be passivised, whereas with the second, the theme may be
passivised:    (91)      No-to-kahu-mo      te    doe            na       kene-su.

or not, dynamic or not, that have the following subcategorisation frame:                      ja‘o    (({Ag]), [Thm/Pt]nom) — ‘bad; ruin’This shows a verb with a patient, and an optional agent. Whether the agent is present or
not, the patient must be the nominative argument in its clause. In an intransitive clause, this
is not a problem; all underived subjects of intransitive clauses are automatically nominative:
104     Chapter 4      (94)    No-ja'o       na          ambere     iwo.
               3R-bad      NOM _ bucket      that:lower
               ‘That bucket down there is wrecked.’
             # ‘That bucket down there has been ruined.’This notation indicates that only one of the following two sentences is grammatical:      (95)    No-ja'o-ke           na    ambere           te     anabou     [mloto akala
              3R-bad-30BJ          NOM _ bucket           CORE   child      have.SI trick
               meiwo’'e.
               REF-that:lower
               ‘That naughty child down there has ruined the bucket.’      (96) * No-ja'o    te      ambere     na     anabou      [mlJoto akala            meiwo’e.
             3R-bad     CORE bucket        NOM    child       have.SI trick            REF-that:lower
             ‘That naughty child down there has ruined the bucket.’In order for an argument other than the highest in the thematic hierarchy (see chapter 3) to
be the nominative one in a sentence, object suffixes must be used. In the case of the
ambitransitive verbs, this means that if the verb is used transitively, then the restriction that
the [Patient] argument must be nominative requires the verb to use object suffixes.
      Other ambitransitive verbs with this subcategorisation frame include the following:                                 bongko             tie, be tied
                                 buke               open, be open
                                 buti               fall, drop

                                 mota’a             cook, be cooked

                                 saba'e             divide, be separate    Finally, one verb, waliako ‘return’, appears to have the following subcategorisation
frame:                        waliako         ({Ag),({Thm/Pt]))        ‘return’This is different from the ambitransitive verbs that all require a nominative patient/theme,
and allow for an optional agent; waliako has an agentive argument, and allows that
argument to act on itself, intransitively, or on another object, transitively. This contrasts
with the closely related verb mbule ‘return’, which is a simple agentive intransitive verb,
and does not allow for a transitive interpretation:                        mbule ({Ag]) ‘return’
                                                                          Word classes   105
4.6     Closed word classesThe closed word classes show less internal division, less derivational morphology, and
much smaller membership than the open classes of noun, verb (and adjective). Some of
these, the independent forms of the pronouns, and the referential and actual
demonstratives, for instance, are better thought of as belonging to a greater nominal class,
but they are described here separately, due to their smaller membership and restricted
derivational possibilities.","[125, 126, 127, 128, 129, 130, 131]"
"5.6          Scope of possessive antecedencyAll pronominals in a language must have some antecedent which they index; in the case of
the verbal indexes, which are bound up in the system of nominative:antecedency and non-
nominative case assignment, the scope of reference is simple. In the case of pronominal
possessive suffixes on nouns, there is no problem in establishing the identity of reference
if there is only one immediate antecedent, as in (84):      (84)      No-rato     na     La lai ako_    te      honda-no.
                3R-arrive NOM      Lalai INSTR CORE motorbike-3POSS
                ‘La Iai; came by means of hisj*) motorbike.’
                (The motorbike is La Iai’s)In the case of a (di)transitive verb, if there is a difference in the person and number
categories between two main arguments of a verb there is similarly no possible confusion
in the reference of a possessive suffix, even if there is no nominal in the sentence:      (85)      I-pa-ma'eka-'e                    ako        te      baliu-miu             na       amai.

                “You guys scared them with your axes .”
              * “You guys scared them with their axes .’
134     Chapter 5If both the subject and the object in the sentence share the same person and number
categories (i.e., they are both third person), then, just as in English, a sentence becomes
ambiguous:      (86)      No-hu'u        te         kene-su                   te        poda-no            na    La Kasi.

                ‘La Kasi; gave my friend; his; knife.’
                ‘La Kasi; gave my friend his; knife.’    Changing the nominative status of the two possible antecedents of te podano does not
resolve the ambiguity:      (87)      No-hu'u-ke          na         kene-su                   te        poda-no

                ‘La Kasi; gave my friend; his; knife.’
                ‘La Kasij gave my friend, hisj knife.’Notice that the ambiguity of antecedency vanishes in English when an object-pivot
sentence type (the passive) is used rather than an active one:      (88)      Mary; gave Anna; her; book      (89)      Anna; was given her; book by Mary;This is not the case in Tukang Besi, as we can see from the ambiguous readings available
to both (86) and (87).","[159, 160]"
"    We find that ako displays different degrees of verb-like behaviour depending on the
semantic role that its object plays in the clause. Examining the ability of ako (in its different
usages) and pake to serve as adjuncts, predicates and modifiers, we arrive with table 26:                                   Table 26. Functions and meanings of ako                       ako                 ako, pake               ako             ako      ako

purposive sense. Unlike the other prepositions, some of which can only appear in adjunct
positions as well, the object of ako (and pake) is present in a KP, and may be replaced
with object suffixes.
     The use of kene in its ‘comitative’ role is somewhat different. Whilst it may appear as a
main verb, and even preserves the ability to represent its argument by means of object
suffixes instead of an NP, it cannot have an object in a KP. Since it appears directly before
the NP, and does not allow an article to appear, a surface string analogous to a
prepositional phrase appears. Compare (121) above with (139) below:    (139)   Ku-tu'o          [te         [[kKau]np      kene       [wemba)yp Jnp' lp.

usage even more preposition-like in appearance:   (140)   Ku-tu'o           [kene     [wemba}np Jcony.
           1SG-fell         and        bamboo
           ‘I felled some things and the bamboo.’Unlike the prepositions, kene may replace its following NP with object suffixes. Other
reasons for regarding kene as a non-preposition are given in chapter 18.
    Another related use of kene is to place emphasis on the object of a KP or a PP. It may
be used to replace the nominative article on an KP, or appear with a local preposition in a
PP:           Replacing an article:
   (141)   No-hoko-mate-'e                 kene      beka-su          le        La bela kompakompa.

           “Yes, but drop some ripe ones for me!’                            (SA:34)    Some speakers allow ke to completely replace the preposition in a PP; so the lack of a
preposition in (143):           Replacing a preposition:
   (143)   O-rato           ke         Kapota.
           3R-arrive and      Kapota
           ‘They arrived even as far as Kapota.’is acceptable for some speakers, whereas others would prefer:   (144)   O-rato           ke         i         Kapota.
           3R-amive and       OBL      Kapota
           ‘They arrived even as far as Kapota.’This is also treated as being an example of the use of kene as a conjunction, and is
discussed in more depth in chapter 18.
    The degree to which these words resemble verbs in their behaviour has been
summarised in table 24. The serial verb pake has exactly the same morphosyntactic
properties as does ako in that table.

                      Possession and possessive
                                    constructions
13.1     IntroductionPossessive constructions in Tukang Besi refer to a difference between alienable and
inalienable possessed items, as is commonly found in many languages. Unlike the
common situation of a morphological difference emerging between the two categories
when they are phrasally possessed, Tukang Besi only distinguishes them in clausal
possession, and leaves phrasal possession as one unified category. There is, however, an
inalienable/plural marker, m/(e)ai, that can be used in conjunction with the normal phrasal
possessive morphology to indicate that the possessed is inalienable or plural (or both).","[360, 361, 362, 363]"
"The use of free pronouns is associated with the introduction or reintroduction of a
participant into the discourse, or with the switching of emphasis to new referents in
discourse. That the pragmatic roles are changing is indicated by the presence of the free
pronouns, but the precise grammatical role played by the participants to which the
pronouns refer is indicated by the article used with the pronoun (te ‘non-nominative core’
or na ‘nominative’) in combination with the verbal morphology (see chapter 3) (In Bresnan
and Mchombo’s (1987b: 23) terminology these are referred to as nonargument functions,
“such as TOP,        FOC,     and ADJUNCT”            and argument functions “such as SUB,       OBJ,
OBL(ique)” ). Since an article can only govern an NP, and not a pronominal affix, the free
forms must be used, as the head of an NP, in order for this system of changing article use
to be productive.
     Morphological possibilities with a free form pronoun are extremely limited. The only
affixing that has been observed is the addition of the emphatic suffix -mo:      (33)   a.   Te         emai     na          ng[{um]Jaa-ako         La Udi?

5.3      Affixed pronominal formsSection 5.2 has shown that the free pronoun set is not obligatorily used in the presence of
verbal affixing. In most environments, thus, a pronominal affix is the preferred way of
tracking the role information about a known referent. This information can be characterised
as topicalised, in the sense given by Bresnan and Mchombo (1987):        what is under discussion, whether previously mentioned or assumed in
        discourse.","[148, 149]"

"2.6       Orthographic issuesI have already introduced the conventions of writing the velar nasal as {ng}, the high back
unrounded vowel as {u}, and the imploded stops as {b} and {d}, respectively. These
spelling conventions basically follow those used in the writing of Indonesian, except for
the addition of the imploded stops, and represent few problems either for phonological
representation or for speakers learning an orthographic system (though see below for a
discussion of the graphemes {b} and {d}).
    Other typographical decisions are not so simple. Representing the glottal stop as { ' } is
accepted by most speakers, especially when it appears between two non-identical vowels,
as in, for instance, the pair:              bae                ‘rice’      (6a?2e]
              ba’e               ‘fruit’     (bac)Word-initially speakers showed less tendency to write the glottal stop; thus ‘oloo ‘sun’ is
likely to be written as oloo. Between like vowels, the Indonesian convention of assuming a
glottal stop is the preferred convention for most speakers:              saat                    ‘moment’           (Indonesian)         [sa?at]              saa                ‘snake’            (Tukang Besi)             ({sa?a}
              (in this grammar represented as sa‘a)Speakers who have learnt to write glottal stops as { ' } tend to write it in both phonemic
and non-phonemic positions; thus, for instance, there is no underlying glottal stop between
the two /a/ vowels separated by a morpheme boundary in helo‘aako ‘cook for’.
Nevertheless, speakers who have learnt to write glottal stops tend to wnite a glottal stop in
44   Chapter 2that position:             helo'a‘ako                 ‘cook for’
             (here represented as helo'aako)    As might be expected, the convention in Indonesian of assuming a glottal stop between
two like vowels makes the writing of a vowel sequence with two identical vowels
contentious.             mentii          ‘fast’             (me'nti2i]          (here represented as menti’i)
             mohi            ‘left’             [mo‘hi:]            (here represented as mohii)Some speakers distinguish phonemic and non-phonemic glottal stops in their writing; these
speakers prefer to use the apostrophe to indicate a non-phonemic glottal stops, and use a
macron above a vowel to indicate a following glottal stop. For instance:             [helo?aako]     ‘cook for’         /helo?a      +   ako/would be written             helda‘ako
             (here written helo‘aako)These same speakers do not automatically add glottal stops between two identical
orthographic vowels, yet do not use two vowels to represent a sequence of two identical
vowels. Their orthographic representations of /menti?i/ ‘fast’ and /mohii/ ‘left’ are the
following:             mentii          ‘fast’             [me'ntiti]
             mohi            ‘left’             [mo'hi:]    A final point of graphic choice remains in the issue of the representation of the
imploded stops /6/ and /d/. Although these sounds do not contrast with plain voiced ones,
most speakers who are familiar with Indonesian have no trouble distinguishing them from
the sounds /b/ and /d/, referring to them as ‘the twenty-sixth and twenty-seventh letters of
the alphabet’. Whilst most speakers accept the use of {b} and {d} for /6/ and /d/, a
minority of speakers reject this as misleading, and not representative of the difference
between the Indonesian pronunciation and their own, and feel that using the same
symbolisation would lead to incorrect pronunciations. These speakers recommend {bp} for
/6/, and {dt} for /d/, a surprisingly astute recognition of the fact that in fact these stops are
not contrastively voiced, but rather contrastively imploded, and have both voiced and
voiceless allophones. Since consonant clusters do not occur in Tukang Besi this is an
option that could be used, but the simpler alternative has been used here.
    Orthographically there also seems to be divided opinion on the representation of
contracted forms. Some, such as awanatu < awana atu, are so lexicalised that they
represent no problems, but others, such as towe < te uwe, are less acceptable when
written. Intermediate between these two extremes are contractions like mbeako wila for
                                                        Phonology and morphophonology          45mbeak(a) owila, which are more common than the ‘full’ form.
     Word boundary decisions are also problematic. I have noticed a preference in many
people’s writing to write KPs and PPs as single words, despite the pronunciation of the
article te marking an object as one phonological word with a preceding verb. For example:        No-'elo       te     ‘obu
        3R-call       CORE   dog
        ‘She called the dog.’        [,no2e'lote   obw]        { Nodelo teobu }    The object clitics that appear on verbs are also a source of word-boundary confusion;
some speakers write these as separate words when they are polysyllabic, but as part of the
verb when not, as in:        No-'elo-aku                 No-'elo-ko           No-'elo-kita
        3R-call-1SG.OBJ             3R-call-2SG.OBJ      3R-call-1PL.OBJ
        ‘She called me.’            ‘She called you.’    ‘She called us.’        (noelo'aku]                 [,no7e'loko]         [no,?elo'kita]        { Noéelo aku }              { Néeloko}           { Noelo kita }    These same speakers acknowledge that the clitics are bound forms, elading to
orthographic confusion.
     Intonational cues are written with the standard punctuation symbols as are used in
English and Indonesian, namely a comma (,), full stop (.), colon (:) and on occasion a
semi-colon (;), though this latter is not often used in writing by Tukang Besi people. The
pragmatic content of these punctuation symbols is roughly equivalent to that found in
English or Indonesian when the same punctuation is used, although the perceptual cues are
often different. Interestingly, in the light of the fact that Tukang Besi has an incipient pitch-
accent system (section 2.3.2), both pitch and duration (the lengthening of a pre-pausal
vowel) play a major part in the intonational system, according to the generalisations
emerging from Nagano-Madsen’s work (1992, 1993) for a pitch-accent language. Despite
only recently having acquired pitch as a lexically relevant phonological feature, it appears
that Tukang Besi fits well into the mould for languages of that type as regards the
realisation of intonation.

                    Syntactic units and the clause
3.1       IntroductionThis chapter discusses the layers of the clause in Tukang Besi, and proposes syntactic tests
for them. The externally motivated tests for the major constituents of the clause, the verb
phrase and the case phrase, are given, followed by a discussion of the three major clause
types in Tukang Besi. An unusual feature of the verbal clause in Tukang Besi is that whilst
the verb unambiguously displays prefixes that index the subject of the verb, and usually
has agreement indexing the object of the verb if transitive, nominal case marking is at
variance with this pattern. The nominals are marked in a Philippine-type manner, the
marking not directly agreeing with the verbal indexes but indicating a syntactically
determine clause.","[69, 70, 71, 72, 73]"
"12.12         | Complex prepositionsThe specific meaning of the general preposition i/di can be, and often is, made more
explicit by the use of directional nouns with the preposition. This appears following the
preposition, as the head of the NP, and the physical location is then added in a genitive
phrase modifying this local noun. The different local nouns observed are:              i wawo                                          on top of
              i woru                                          underneath

              ilaro                                           insideOnly luara is suspect, being clearly a recent loan from Malay luar. Although no longer
current in northern Tukang Besi, other languages of Southeast Sulawesi that do not have a
loan word for ‘outside’ often use the same word for ‘outside’ as is used for ‘behind’, often
cognate with or identical to taliku. In southern Tukang Besi the word mburi is used with
this meaning, both outside and behind. Some examples of the use of these local nouns are
given in (130) - (132):      (130)    No-torae-'e        na           boku-no             {i       waw(o)      [u        meja)xp ]pp.

‘preposition-like’ functions (other than the instrumental functions) best thought of as a
conjunction. The reasons for the treatment of ako and pake as verbs in non-contiguous
serial verb constructions, rather than as prepositions, are given below. Some of the
discussion concerning kene is given here, but it is mainly treated in chapter 18.
     When ako is functioning as a main verb, meaning ‘do for’, it obeys the restrictions on
verbal behaviour, such as requiring the subject relative clause morphology when used to
modify an NP (see chapter 15), or requiring subject prefixes when predicative:    (133)   No-wila-mo        na        wowine       [[um]ako-aku]pc.

            “Haven't you done it for me yet?’    This is not the case when it is used in a more ‘prepositional’ function, as (137) and
(138) illustrate. (137) shows ako modifying olibolu without any relative clause
morphology, and (138) shows ako without subject prefixes in a serial verb construction,
and not contiguously attached to the verb (as seen in chapters 8 and 10):    (137)   Te        anit                   olibolu.          —{ako-akuJrc.

"3.4.4      Ditransitive verbs and multiple objectsThere is only one verb that is unambiguously ditransitive in Tukang Besi, hu'u ‘give’.
Two other verbs display ditransitive behaviour. One of these, kahu ‘send’ has two
alternative subcategorisation frames, the first ditransitive: ([Agent] [Dative] [Theme]) and
the other transitive ([Agent] [Theme]) ([Dative]). See chapter 4 for a discussion. The
second, sumbanga ‘donate’ is a (probably recent) loan word (< Malay sumbang ‘donate’),
and is not treated consistently by speakers, perhaps because it is still an unstable
borrowing. With this verb, from the theme and the dative arguments, only the DATIVE
nominal may be treated as an object; the nominal in theme role cannot be indexed on the
verb (deriving the verb through the use of the applicative suffix -ako does allow the theme
                                                                                Syntactic units and the clause     55to be treated in some respects as an object. This is elaborated in chapter 10). Compare the
articles used on the nominals in (9) with those in the corresponding object suffixed

             ‘You will give me some fish.’
             (Good for: “You will give me to the fish.’)    In most cases involving the verb hu'u there is no possible confusion between the
recipient and the theme arguments, which are case marked the same way in (10), or
between the recipient and theme objects, identically case marked in (9), and so the word
order is not fixed. There are possible sentences in which both the recipient and the theme
are animate, as seen in (12):    (12)    Noj-hu'u          te         rajaj                 te          tudu'ay.

             ‘She gave a slave to the king.’In this case, the word order is fixed: te tudu‘a cannot precede te raja without causing a
change in the meaning:    (13)    Noj-hu'u          te         tudu‘a,—              te          raja).

             ‘She gave the king to a slave.’
           * ‘She gave a slave to the king.’We can see that there is a preference, when potential ambiguities present themselves, to
have the recipient precede the theme (though compare (13) with (9), where there is no
potential for ambiguity, and no restriction on the relative ordering of the two objects).
    With ditransitive verbs that have an optional instrument as well as an agent and a
patient (see chapter 4.5.1 for details on this), the order is fixed: the patient must precede
the instrument, as seen in (14) and (15):    (14)    Noj-tompa-'e;          na            ‘obuj         te          walt.

           3R-give-30BJ            CORE          stone NOM                 dog    A sentence with a non-nominative object is just as ungrammatical as (15) when the
56      Chapter3instrument precedes the patient: * Noj-tompa te watu, te ‘obu;. With the instrument
following the theme, and both marked with te, there is no problem with grammaticality:
Notompa te ‘obu te watu.
      Verbs with applicative morphology, introducing an extra object as a core argument, are
similarly restricted as to which of the two ‘objects’ may be treated as the [O]. See Chapter
9.2 for further discussion.","[80, 81, 82]"

The reason that such an analysis is not adopted here is based on two factors. The first is
that kene does not behave as a typical preposition in some ways, most notably its ability to
have the NP that it governs replaced by object suffixes (as discussed in chapter 12.12).
Secondly, if we assumed a structure such as (51)' to represent (51), we would, to be
consistent, have to assume that the structure behind sentences such as (47) is that given in
(47)':    (47)'                                   S

    Furthermore, we would have trouble explaining why a prepositional phrase, a
supposedly independent syntactic unit serving as an adjunct in the clause, can only refer to
an antecedent in [O] syntactic role. That is, if the structure behind (69) was that shown in
(69)':    (69)    Maka          no-po-'awa-ngkene-'e                      [[ke   [ana-no]np Jconr.

we would have to explain why ke anano can only refer to an addition to the [O] argument,
and not the [A] argument. If the prepositional analysis was taken, the structure behind
(67), repeated here, would be that shown in (67)’:    (67)    Jari       toj-po-'awa-ngkene-'e;

one of the arguments in the clause, and not the other (in practical terms, why the reading
‘So we and his friend met La Ijaunga in Wa 'Ega.’ is ungrammatical for (67)). With other
oblique arguments, such as i, an adjunct phrase can refer to either (or both) of the
arguments in a transitive clause:    (73)        No-‘ita-'e        — [[na_     [ama-no)np)xp_ = [[i__——[koranga)p Ixp.

The alternative interpretations of (73) show that prepositional phrases are not restricted to
appearing with a particular argument; nominative or not, [A] or [O] are equally likely
antecedents of a prepositional phrase.
    If, on the other hand, we assume that the restriction is on the ability to float away from
the CONJ's normal position in the KP (floating out of normal position is also found with
adverbs, described in chapter 7, and certain qualifiers, described in chapter 20, and so is
not a process that would need to be invoked especially to account for these data), then the
control ceases to be a problem, and we have a simple grammatical restriction (only the (S]
444     Chapter 18or (O] argument in a clause) as to the ability to launch a floated conjunct. The structure
behind (69) is thus taken to be analogous to that shown in (70)' and (71)’, and is shown in

18.7         Reciprocal constructionsIn a reciprocal construction, using the prefix po- (see chapter 11), there are necessarily two
NPs at the level of argument structure. Often only one of these is found in the surface
structure. Compare (74), showing a subject prefix on the verb that agrees with the person
and number features of the NP’, and (75), in which only one of the NPs is indexed on the
verb, the one that is not present:      (74)         TI     sala     kua             Waha,i             rearea       ai     10; j-PpO-'awa

                   ‘On the road to Waha, Wa Inggi and I met this morning.’This appears to be the same phenomenon that was seen in the previous section on floating
conjunctions, namely that there is KP-obviation at work removing one of the NPs and the
article. The syntax in a reciprocal construction is slightly different, however, in that (76) is
not grammatical (compare with (47) in section 18.4):      (76)    *1          sala     kua             Waha,i             rearea       ai     ku; -po-'awa

                   ‘On the road to Waha, Wa Inggi and I met this morning.’The following restriction is found in reciprocal constructions: if one NP (the first, and
highest in animacy) in the coordinated KP imposes its person and number categories over
those of the KP as a whole, then it may not be overtly realised in the KP. In other words,
the verbal index is obligatorily interpreted as pronominal in this case. We may formalise
this as follows:
                                                                           Conjoining   445       PROsUB] [REC], Verbal                      [+]

This does not state that the PRO value of a subject prefix is [ - ] if the person and number
categories indexed there are those of [NPj + NPj], but rather that the PRO value of a

                                      Speech acts19.1    Speech acts: introductionA discussion of sentence types must include reference to both the number of distinctions
that a language makes in terms of morphosyntactic peculiarities that a particular sentence
type possesses, and the different types of speech acts that may be carried out by the use of
one and the same grammatical category. Most researchers into the topic (e.g. Searle 1979)
make a distinction between SITUATIONAL CATEGORIES, which are concerned with the
intent of the speech act regardless of the sentence type used, and GRAMMATICAL
CATEGORIES, which are sentence forms used to realise the different situational categories.
Important to this thesis is that these different categories do not share a one-to-one
relationship; whilst a statement is usually realised as a sentence with the grammatical
category of declarative, for instance, this is not always the case. Sinclair and Coulthard
(1975:29) state that       Of the nine possible combinations—declarative statement, declarative question,
       declarative command,     and so on—there is only one we cannot instance:
       imperative statement.","[467, 468, 469, 470, 471, 472, 473]"
"   Some examples of these patterns and their differences are given in (6) and (7):           Transitive verb with object agreement:
    (6)    a.   No-kiki'i-ko         (na __ iko'o)     te        beka.
                3R-bite-2SG.0BJ      NOM     2SG_      CORE      cat
                ‘The cat bit you.’          b. * No-kiki'i-ko          te      iko'o     na        beka.
                3R-bite-2SG.0B]      CORE    2SG       NOM       cat
                ‘The cat bit you.’           Transitive verb without object agreement:
    (7)    a.   No-kiki't   te       iko'o   na        beka.
                3R-bite     CORE     2SG     NOM       cat
                ‘The cat bit you.’          b. * No-kiki't    te       beka    na        iko'o.
                3R-bite     CORE     cat     NOM       2SG
                ‘The cat bit you.’In both (6a) and (7a) the agent beka is indexed on the verb by the third person realis
subject prefix no-, and additionally in (6) the second person singular object is indexed by
means of the second person singular object agreement marker -ko. When this agreement
marker is not used, as in (7), the agent beka must be marked by the nominative article na,
and iko’o by the non-nominative article te. This variation in the presence or absence of
object agreement is the only way that the case assigned to nominals may be changed; note
the ungrammatical (6b) and (7b). Clearly, the presence or absence of object agreement on
verbs functions as a form of voice system. The analysis adopted here is that it is a
Philippine-style voice system, with a restricted range of categories, two (a stronger case
for this position is put in Chapter 7.6.1, and an alternative is considered in 7.6.2). In
Tukang Besi the diachronic drift towards head-marking pronominal indexing has
proceeded to quite an extent, but at the same time the overt Philippine-style case system has
been preserved, and its verbal cues reinterpreted as being those involving the presence
versus absence of the object agreement.
    Although the transitive verbs we have seen can appear either with or without object
agreement, there is evidence that the suffixed (ie., morphologically more complex)
versions are in some sense the ‘basic’ ones: they appear more frequently in texts
(approximately 70% of transitive verbs in texts use object agreement); they are the citation
54      Chapter 3forms of most transitive verbs; and, although all transitive clauses may appear with object
agreement, there are some transitive clauses that cannot appear without object agreement,
such as the verb molinga ‘remember’. Furthermore, there are many verbs (see chapter
4.3.3) that, if used transitively, require object agreement, and the limited data available to
me on child language acquisition suggests that children learning Tukang Besi acquire a
command of the object agreement earlier than they do of the subject prefixes. Children
often substitute the near-frozen ‘adjectival’ prefix mo- in the place of subject prefixes until
they are about 5 or 6 years old, but seem to be able to manipulate the object suffixes on
their verbs much earlier, indicating that object indexing is learnt earlier than is subject
indexing.","[79, 80]"
"4.6.1   Personal pronounsPersonal pronouns are available for first, second and third persons, and further
differentiate number three ways for first person (singular, paucal and plural), and two
ways for second person (singular and plural). The paucal category is being eroded to
become a plural exclusive one, through contact with other languages, foremost Malay, that
use this distinction. The pronoun class can be thought of as having one set of free forms,
two prefixed sets, and three suffixed sets (one of which is becoming obsolete). There are,
however, very few features distinguishing the free forms of the pronouns from any other
noun, and might be better thought of as being specialised nouns, leaving only the bound
forms as true pronouns. Further details on the forms of the various pronominal sets are
given in Chapter 5.",[131]

              (Glossing literally, ‘It has just lightninged.’)7.2.1      Irrealis subject prefixesThe irrealis set of subject prefixes are used to refer to a state or event that is unrealised.
This can be at the time of the utterance itself, or at the time of the point of reference of the
utterance. The irrealis prefixes are used to show an intention on the part of the subject, or a
necessary or likely outcome. The basic difference between the realis and irrealis prefixes
can be seen in examples (7) and (8), where (7) describes an action that is completed and
(8) expresses the speaker’s idea about the outcome of the action. The irrealis forms are
very often used in combination with the subject focus infix -(um]- (see 7.3); the use of this
infix in combination with the irrealis pronoun set suggests a greater degree of volition on
the part of the actor. The difference between (8) and (10) is one of volition, that between
(8) and (9) one of immediacy:    (7)        No-baiara-'e.
               3R-pay-30BJ

               ‘She is going to pay it.’    (9)        No-b{um]aiara.

               ‘She will/wants to pay.’     Object agreement is only rarely used in combination with the irrealis forms of the first
and second person subject prefixes, and only if the -{urn]- infix is used. It is likely that this
is not a grammatical, but a discourse constraint. The use of object suffixes goes hand in
hand with nominative Case, and thus pragmatic prominence, being assigned to the object.
This is an unlikely situation when a person is referring to her/his own intentions, or those
of the addressee. Compare the (roughly equivalent) unusualness of the use of the English
passive in ‘It will be paid by you.’ compared to the more natural use with a perfective
sentence such as ‘It was paid by you.’    (11)       Ko-tarima       ‘uka_sa-ba’e.

is not yet realised, it is not the case that all unrealised actions require irrealis forms; (9)
above shows this to be the case. This is further illustrated by the following two sentences,
illustrating the use of realis pronouns for future events, in (16), and for negated events,
seen in (17):      (16)      ""Mai        La Bekabeka,        ku-bawa-ako-ko                 kua=—s   mawi

            ‘Is he going?’using an irrealis pronoun without the subject focus infix; her focus was on the fact that my
going was seen as unusual, and that was emphasised by the lack of subject focus infix,
which would have indicated more intention, and the presence of the irrealis pronoun, to
show that the certainty of the outcome was being questioned. About five minutes later,
when asking me if her classificatory brother was going to go to my house the next day, I
replied    (27)    Oho,    no-wila.

there is still a bewildering array of grammatical pivots shown in the summary above.
    We can make more sense out of this apparent confusion by an examination of the terms
and categories involved. The core semantic roles of [Agent], [Dative], [Instrument],
(Theme/Patient] have been established by reference to the facts concerning causatives and
applicatives (see chapters 9 and 10). Further restrictions on accessibility to various
grammatical processes that are dependent on an argument bearing [Agent], [Instrument] or
[Theme/Patient] role have been presented and summarised in this chapter. Reference to this
thematic hierarchy and the semantic role that an argument bears is thus established as
essential to a description of grammatical processes in Tukang Besi. The other terms used,
the syntactic roles ({A], [S] and [O}) and the pragmatic roles ([NOM] and [- NOM)) will
now be examined to determine their function in the description.","[505, 506, 507]"
"20.13.4     NominativeThe nominative argument in a simple intransitive clause is the sole argument of that clause.
488 Chapter 20In a transitive clause the nominative argument may be either the [A] or the [O] (Though
some verbs (see chapter 4) require that if there is an [O] present, it must be nominative);
this alternation is monitored in Tukang Besi by the presence or absence of object suffixes
on the verb (as described in chapter 3). The important point to note is that the nominative
argument is NOT definable in terms of the syntactic roles (A], [S] and [O] (either [A] or [O]
may be the nominative argument in a transitive clause), nor in terms of the semantic roles
that the argument bears (any argument in [A], [S] and [O] role may be the nominative
argument in a clause regardless of its semantic role). It is thus an independent variable
(probably based on pragmatic factors), and we must conclude that there are two different
types of basic transitive clauses (discussed in chapter 3), with one more prevalent than the
other. The assignment of the nominative grammatical relation is essentially as seen in (166)
(though see the concluding remarks to chapter 3 for a more detailed representation of the
structure of a clause):   (166)    ‘PRED      ...[    ]...)’                         [NOM]
That is, any argument that is subcategorised-for by the verb may be nominative (though
see the discussion of the category [O] in 20.14.3 for the problems associated with
ditransitive verbs). If there are no object suffixes on the verb, the [A] is the nominative
argument. If there are object suffixes on the verb, the [O] is nominative:             Verbal pronominal suffix:         (none)
   (167)    ‘PRED      ({ ],[ ]...)                      [NOM]
            Verbal pronominal suffix:          -object
   (168)   ‘PRED       ({ },[ ]...)’                              [NOM]
    This is the same set of positions that are defined in the better-known Philippine type
languages, such as Tagalog which uses the mag- and -in- forms of the verb to distinguish
these categories, though with less regularity and more lexically-determined classes (see
Donohue and Maclachlan forthcoming).
    The fact that the Tukang Besi system of alternation involving the presence versus the
absence of object suffixes on the verb monitors exactly the same set of relationships
between arguments of the verb is strong evidence that the Tukang Besi system is, despite
the appearance of being a system simply dedicated to inflecting the verb for person and
number categories of the object, actually serving in the same function as the less
ambiguous Tagalog system. Note that Sells’ suggestions that the subject (the nominative
argument) in Philippine languages “‘is itself a null pronominal argument” would fit in well
with the apparently conflicting evidence that the object suffixes in Tukang Besi are
simultaneously pronominal elements and Philippine-style voice markers (Sells 1995b); the
                                                    Pivots and grammatical relations      489object suffixes would be viewed as overt pronominal elements (as described in chapter 5),
and also part of the system monitoring the voice system (as described in chapter 7).","[513, 514, 515]"
"    The second of these examples was produced by a 25-year old informant in 1993,
whilst translating, and deliberately attempting a very formal and old-fashioned style. This
indicates that, even if the use of genitives to index the non-head arguments of a subject
relative clause is no longer common, it is a very recent change that has seen this usage
abandoned.
376     Chapter 15
15.5         Instrumental relative clauseAn instrument may be relativised, without the use of any special morphology on the verb
(in most cases it is also possible to relativise these arguments with using the -/um]- infix
found in subject relative clauses (section 15.4) or the i- prefix (discussed in 15.6) on the
verb.). The internal structure of the relative clause is almost the same as a subject relative
clause, with a partially complete clause left behind. In the case of an instrumental relative
clause there can be no mention of a by-phrase, only the patient/theme of the verb being
present. Since there is no morphology on the verb that specifies it as subordinate, only the
absence of a subject prefix on the verb indicates that the verb is introducing a relative
clause. Examples of the derivation of this relative clause type from a matrix clause can be
seen in (40) - (41):                Matrix clause:
      (40)      Ku-bongko        te     hao    te      osimpu.
                1SG-tie          CORE rope     CORE young.coconut
                ‘I tied the young coconuts (together) with a piece of rope.’                Relative clause:
      (41)      Te      iso      te        hao’     [bongko          te         osimpu]rc.
                CORE yon         CORE rope       tie         CORE young.coconut
                ‘That there is the rope that (I used / was used to) tie the young coconuts.’Unlike the object relative clause, the by-phrase may not be expressed in the relative clause:      (42)      Te     baliu-su        [tu'o te         kaujpc              —- no-mohama.

                ‘My axe that (I) chop trees with is sharp.’      This morphologically unmarked relative clause type is distinguished from an adjective
only by its position in the noun phrase, appearing consistently after possessive suffixing,
whereas the adjective appears before the possessive:      (44)      Te      baliu-su           [tu‘o}rc...

            CORE      axe-1SG.POSS      bigThis sentence is acceptable if to‘oge is treated as a verb, and marked as such:    (47)    Te        baliu-su          t{um]o'oge.

    The fact that this relative clause type is available to any argument in instrumental
semantic role, and is not limited to a particular syntactic role, means that the object of the
verb pake ‘use’ may appear in an instrumental relative clause, as a result of its semantic
role as the instrument of the matrix clause, or in an object relative clause, as a result of its
syntactic role as the object in the matrix clause. In an instrumental relative clause,
however, the agent of the sentence may not be mentioned:    (48)    Te      ndamu      [pake)pc          180...
            CORE axe           use               yon

instrumental relative clauses. It is also possible for an instrumental subject to head an
instrumental relative clause, as well as a subject relative clause:    (50)    [Te    wande      [raho-kami         i                 abajrc |p

some differences in the make-up of the bracketed material following. This is less
significant, however, in that the order shown in the curly brackets is a preferred order
only, not an absolute one. For stylistic reasons, this preferred order of modifiers may be
altered. The choices available for the demonstrative position, however, seem to be
absolute. Only nominative phrases may occur with the anaphoric marker ai, and only non-
nominative phrases may appear with the previous discourse indicator ba‘i. Furthermore,
the position of this demonstrative material is fixed with respect to the rest of the NP. It is
always the right-most part of an NP
     A distinction needs to be made between NPs in which the article is followed by a head
in the N position, and those which are not. An NP with an N constituent is called a headed
NP; it is distinguished from an NP without a constituent in this position by the
modificational possibilities available, which are in all cases greater for a headed NP.
Details of some of the constituents of an NP are dealt with in other chapters, such as those
on pronouns, demonstratives, possession, and the section on relative clauses in chapter
15. The discussion here shall centre on the possibilities for modification of different types
of NPs.","[330, 331]"
"3.7              Pragmatically determined variations in clause structure3.7.1        Pre-verbal positionThe basic order of constituents presented in 3.4.1 and 3.4.2 can be, and often is, modified
through the appearance of an argument before the verb. There are two strategies by which
a nominal can appear in a preverbal position, either fronting within the clause, which
serves as a ‘focusing’ strategy, or fronting to a position outside the clause, topicalising the
nominal. Topicalisation is discussed in 3.7.2, and clause-internal fronting is discussed in
this section. This is very similar to the position that Durie (1987) called the CORE TOPIC;
this term is not appropriate for Tukang Besi, however, since non-core time expressions
may also occur in this position (see 3.11.3). See also Aissen (1992) for a discussion of
two different preverbal positions in Mayan languages, and King (1995) on Russian, and
the theoretical implications in a unification grammar.
     Within the clause, only a nominal bearing the nominative grammatical relation may be
fronted. The nominal is placed in a pre-verbal position, yet still within the clause, and the
article of the nominal is not the nominative na, but rather the more general te. We can thus
say that arguments with nominative case are marked by either the article na, or by preverbal
position (and the general article te). The pronominal marking on the verb is unaffected by
this process. The changes in constituent order and article use can be summarised as
follows:

object-suffix-dropping version of (1) is fronted as (33):    (31)       Te      kene-no         no-'ita-‘e               te       ana.

               ‘The child saw its friend.’Note the difference between (31) and (33), in which the grammatical relations are signalled
only by constituent order and the object suffix on the verb. Further specification that a
nominal is focussed, beyond this preverbal positioning, can be given with the use of
ba‘anomo ‘it is the one’:    (34)       Ba'anomo         te        iaku        ku-‘ita       te       laku.

               ‘I’m the one who saw the cuscus.’3.7.2      TopicalisationA wider range of nominals may be fronted by topicalising to a clause-external position than
is possible by moving to a preverbal position, but staying within the clause. The article on
all topicalised nominals is the non-nominative article te. The pronominal marking on the
verb is unaffected by this process, and both nominative and non-nominative core
arguments may be topicalised. The most significant difference between clause-external
topicalising and clause-internal fronting is that topicalisation necessarily accompanied by a
pause separating it from the rest of the clause, which is indicated here by the use of a
comma (I use the term ‘pause’ in accordance with traditional terminology, though all
acoustic studies of ‘pauses’ have shown that what is perceptually a pause rarely involves a
period without phonation, but rather represents a break in the intonation contour of the
utterance (Chafe 1980:         14, Cruttenden           1986:36-39). This is realised acoustically by
lengthening of the last pre-pausal segment, and a break in the Fp contour.). Additionally,
non-nominative core arguments and non-core arguments may be topicalised, but not
fronted. The changes in constituent order and article use can be summarised as follows:
                                                                               Syntactic units and the clause   61

topicalised nominal is not immediately apparent before the rest of the sentence is uttered.
Other devices can also be used to emphasise the fact that a nominal is topicalised:

modified (see (9) for an example of the ungrammaticality of possessive suffixes with free

instance a dog called Si‘i, this is done by the use of an appositional phrase within the same

        head, but rather they express a coordinated one, to further clarify the head
        noun by e.g. the extent of the head noun, proper nouns, positions, or purpose.","[338, 339, 340]"

"3.8.3      Grammatical relations versus Morphological caseWe have already seen that it is necessary to recognise a certain grammatical relation
associated with nominals bearing nominative case as a descriptive element underlying
several processes in this chapter, such as the ability to be fronted within the clause (further
discussion can be found in chapter 20). However, it has also been seen that once fronted a
noun phrase loses the explicit nominative marking, and is instead marked by the general
article te. This has already been illustrated in sections 3.7.1 and 3.7.2, and the relevant
examples are repeated here for easy reference:    (1)       =No-'‘ita-'e        na       kene-no          te        ana.
              3R-see-30B}         NOM      friend-3POSS     CORE      child
              ‘The child saw its friend.’    (31)      Te        kene-no            no-'ita-'e       te        ana.
              CORE friend-3POSS 3R-see-30BJ                 CORE      child
              ‘The child saw its friend.’Here we can see that the nominatively marked keneno, when fronted, has the explicitly
nominative case marker replaced by the more general te. Given that the subcategorised
argument position of the verb is actually filled by the pronominal affix on the verb (see
chapter 5), once the identity of the referent has been established, the nominal may be
wholly dispensed with, giving (53):    (53)      No-'‘ita-'e         te       ana.
              3R-see-30BJ         CORE     child
              ‘The child saw her/him/it/them.’    It can be shown, however, through various syntactic tests, that although te keneno in
(31) and the object suffix in (53) are not explicitly marked by the nominative article, they
still behave as an argument bearing the nominative grammatical relation would behave, for
instance by being able to launch floating quantifiers, a property not available to non-
nominative arguments. This is illustrated in (54) - (56), with subscripts used to show the
launcher of the floated quantifier:    (54)      Sa-miaj        no-'ita-'e           na    kene-noj             te     ana.

                  ‘The child saw one of them.’
                * ‘One of the children saw them.’We must then recognise that although the arguments in (31) and (53) are not marked for
morphological nominative case, they nevertheless behave as a nominative argument does; I
shall refer to these arguments as being the nominative pivot.
     The opposite phenomenon, that of an argument being marked with the nominative
article, but displaying none of the properties that distinguish nominative arguments from
non-nominative ones, also occurs. In a passive construction, the (derived) subject of the
passive verb is marked with the nominative na; it does not, however, display any of the
syntactic properties normally associated with nominative arguments; this is illustrated again
with floating quantifiers, though other properties produce the same result. In (58) we can
see that, despite overtly appearing in nominative case, the argument anano mai cannot
launch a floated quantifier:     (57)        No-to-kiki'i      na         ana-no               mai.
                 3R-PASS-bite      NOM _      child-3POSS          INAL

                 3-CLASS      3R-PASS-bite       NOM        child-3POSS   INALIn this case, we must say that the argument displays nominative case, as indicated by the
choice of article, but does not carry the nominative pivot, as shown by its (lack of)
nominatively controlled syntactic properties; the single argument of a passive verb lacks
not only all properties associated with nominative arguments, but also the syntactic
property that is associated specifically with non-nominative core arguments, namely the
ability to launch a floating adverb. It does, however, participate in a number of other
(argument structure-dependant) pivot processes. See chapters 11, 15 and 20 for more
details on this construction.","[91, 92]"
"15.7       Internal relative clausesIn this type of relative clause, the relative clause contains the noun that it modifies, and
does not use any special morphology to indicate the subordinate nature of the verb. The
main restriction placed on the relative clause is that the head noun must be nominatively
marked. The matrix clause must also be constructed to allow the relative construction to
occur in an KP position that can be nominatively marked. In the following examples, the
marked Predicate-Head order in an equative clause provides that prerequisite:
386     Chapter 15      (86)    Te      wowine           [ku-'ita-'e         na        mia)rc-

              ‘I saw the person who left.’The interesting constraint associated with this construction emerges when we consider that
the following sentences are NOT acceptable:      (90)   *Te      kene-su          [no-‘ita    te     kalambe                              (na   mia) rc.

              3R-see-1SG.OBJ          3R-go           NOM _      person
              ‘The person who left saw me.’In sentence (90) the relative construction is in a position to be nominatively marked in the
matrix clause, but the sentence is unacceptable because the nominative argument in the
relative construction is not an [O], but the [A] of its clause. In (91) the [S] of the relative
clause is nominative, but the relative construction is not in a position that could be
nominative in the matrix clause, and so is also ungrammatical (the nominative argument of
the matrix clause must be the object, which is first person, and so cannot be the third
person na mia) The ungrammaticality lies in the syntactic role played by the head noun in
the relative clause: in addition to being nominatively marked, the head noun must be in [S}
or [O] function, or be the ‘subject’ of an equative clause, in both clauses.
    An example using a non-verbal equative clause is given in (92):      (92)   *Te         kene-su                 [no-manga-'e        na          mia)rc.

              ‘The person who ate it is my friend.’
              (Good for: ‘My friend is the person who they ate.’, but there are no
              cannibals amongst the Tukang Besi )We can formulate the conditions necessary for being the head of an internal relative clause
as follows:
                                                                                   Relative clauses   387

                 IntIRCThis states that the argument must be the lowest core argument in the subcategorisation
frame for its predicate. In the case of an intransitive predicate, this is the sole argument. In
the case of a transitive predicate, this is the argument in [O] syntactic role. Furthermore,
the argument needs to be specified as nominative.","[411, 412, 413]"
"This sort of serial verb construction is also found in Tukang Besi, except that, perhaps
predictably, the ordering of the two verbs is the other way around, with the first verb
commenting on the general action denoted by the second verb (Paamese, which Crowley
was discussing, is an SVO language, whereas Tukang Besi is basically a VOS language).
This is exemplified in (22):              Ambient:
    (22)      [O-tantu]y       [[{no-rato]y      sabentara}.
              3R-certain       3R-arrive        in.a.moment
              ‘They'll be here in a moment for certain.’
              (ie., ‘It is certain they will arrive in a moment.’)    These constructions appear to violate the otherwise firm restriction that there must be
some argument-sharing between the two verbs in the serial verb construction, one of the
defining characteristics introduced at the start of this chapter. It is clear, however, that the
sort of predicates that enter into this sort of construction are precisely the sort that are used
in raising constructions in languages like English. A similar solution is proposed to the
apparent contradiction that arises in calling these serial verb constructions when there is no
shared argument: one of the verbs, o-mura in the example below, does not assign any

prefixes of the two verbs to agree or not, a division that also corresponds to the ability of
any aspectual marking to appear on the second verb or not. These two sorts of serialisation
are discussed separately below in sections 8.2.4 and 8.2.5.
190     Chapter 88.2.4        Ambient serialisation with no subject agreementThere are two types of ambient serialisation, the (more common) case of third-person
marking        on the first verb (all ambient serialisation is non-contiguous),            and ambient
serialisation with the semi-verb ane, which does not take subject prefixes at all. In both
cases, the first verb is a comment on the whole clause that is headed by the second verb.
The third person subject prefix on the ambient serialised verb can be thought of as indexing
the whole following clause. This would explain why it is invariably third person (the same
as is found with impersonal, subjectless weather verbs (see chapter 20), and optionally
with passive verbs), and displays no agreement with the following subject prefix. The
relationship between the two verbs can be characterised as follows:                              x does V2 (to y), and the whole event is V1.","[215, 216]"

              ‘They threw mangoes (as if throwing stones).’    Simple transitive verbs with dative objects are rare; indeed, only hoti ‘donate (food or
clothing)’, and speech act verbs such as balo ‘answer’, and ‘ema ‘ask’ have been
identified in this frame so far. Unlike hu‘u ‘give’, which takes a dative and a theme object,
hoti has an assumed object, food or clothing, that may not be overtly expressed nominally.
Compare (68) and (69) with the ungrammatical (70):

             ‘They donated sweet potato to the hungry child.’This behaviour can probably be attributed to the fact that hoti, used nominally, has the
meaning ‘meal’. However, even when referring to clothing donated charitably, the object
may not be mentioned:    (71)   * No-hoti                         ana      mo'aro”—          ite    baju.

             ‘They donated a shirt to the hungry child.’    Note that [Agent] is the most versatile top semantic role in transitive verbs frames, able
to appear with all the other semantic roles, and that [Theme/Patient] is the most versatile
bottom semantic role, able to appear with any of the other semantic roles above it. This
provides support for the notion that the proto-typical subject of a transitive clause is an
[Agent], and that the prototypical object is a [Theme/Patient].
   Further examples of transitive verbs, divided according to their subcategorisation
frames, include:

transitive verb may be omitted; a drop in transitivity does not require morphological
derivation in order to be grammatical, but may occur at any time. This has been indicated in
the subcategorisation frame by the bracketing around the object in each of these frames. In
the case of an unspecified object, the culturally or contextually unmarked object is assumed
(e.g., manga ‘eat’ takes manga ‘cassava’ as its assumed object; pake ‘use’, in the context
of a discussion on blacksmithing, takes palu ‘hammer’, as its assumed object).
    Two subclasses of the ({Ag], ({Thm/Pt])) class of verbs exists, verbs which
subcategorise for an optional core argument in instrumental role, as well as a patient, thus
98    Chapter 4representing a kind of ‘ditransitive’ construction. The first of these subcategorises for an
extra argument:                     simbi {[Ag), ([Instr}), ([Pt)))       ‘slash’    Other verbs with a subcategorisation frame allowing a core instrumental argument
include the following:                           bongko               tie
                           gonti                chop

                           tu'o                 fell    The second subclass also involves an instrument in addition to a theme/patient
argument, but has the restriction that the instrument may not be nominative:                     tompa {(Ag], ({Instr].nom), ((Pt]))       ‘throw (something) at’Compare the grammaticality of (72) and (73), with nominative instruments:     (72)    No-simbi-'e    te     pada            na       kabali.

              “He threw the mud at the dogs.’    This second subclass includes verbs in which the instrument cannot so readily be
thought of as an intermediate agent (following Marantz 1984: 247); the instrumental knife
involved in the verb ‘cut’ is much more easily thought of as an intermediary agent than is
the instrumental stone in a verb like ‘throw’ (note, however, that unlike English a sentence
like ‘The machete slashed the kunai grass.’ is NOT grammatical in Tukang Besi, as some
agent must be expressed or implied; only a small number of weather verbs allow for an
instrument to act as the subject in their clause). Other verbs in this subclass include:                           tompa                throw
                           hambere              throw something long

as another non-subject core argument differ from the verbs that take a sole instrumental
object in that the head of an object relative clause may not be the instrumental object in the
case of these verbs, whereas it may be for verbs with instrumental main objects. Compare
(74) and (75):

               constructions to express the instrument in a relative clause that is distinct

               of the following sentences are grammatical: Te kabali simbisu, Te kabali

instrumental role; with the verbs that can, it appears that there is a default choice of
instrument, such as kabali ‘machete’ as the default instrument used with simbi, or poda
‘knife’ the default instrument used with robo ‘stab’. A verb that does not have a default
instrument is helo’a ‘cook’. Compare the grammatical (76) with the ungrammatical (77):    (76)       No-simbi te        pada           te      kabali.

theme/patient argument may be subject in a passive sentence, whereas both the recipient
and theme arguments of hu‘u may be subject in a passive sentence (as exemplified in
chapter 11).","[122, 123, 124, 125]"

themselves, or flatly reject it as being ungrammatical Tukang Besi (as is the case with (50)
and (51), even though they are both easily parsed and interpreted).
    There appears to be a dividing line for acceptability of use of hoto to introduce the
possessed item: if it is a kin term, body part, or part-whole relation, a construction with the
verb hoto- is less likely to be used, such as seen in (49), and also in (48). Kin terms
referring to family related by marriage (i.e., not cosanguinal kin) are much more acceptable
as objects of a hoto construction:    (52)    Mbeaka      ku-hoto      sanggalapa.

          ‘I don’t have an elder brother.’In (52) and (53) we can also see the use of the predicate negator mbea(ka) with hoto (the
-ka is frequently omitted before other aspect marking; mbea-ho ‘not yet’, mbea-mo ‘not
any more’, mbea-do ‘certainly not yet’. For emphatic use, the -ka may be preserved). The
verbal identity of horo is clear; object suffixes can be used on the verb to emphasise the
identity of the possessed, as seen in (54):   (54)    Te      wunua       _to'oge,     _—iku-hoto-'e.

           ‘I have a big house.’
           (not something else, like just a little hut in the gardens)
           (Note that the nominal object here is NOT incorporated; the object suffix
           occupies the object position in the verbal complex, and the nominal is a
           nominative adjunct to this pronominal representation. See chapter 5 for a
           discussion of the status of verbal indexing.)   An alternative to this verbal means of indicating possession at the clause level is the use
of a variant of the existential clause, using the semi-verb ane ‘have, be, exist’. The
nominal governed by this semi-verb is present in an oblique phrase, and is suffixed by
possessive suffixes, or a genitive phrase, and these show the identity of the owner:            ane        ke     X-POSS
            exist  and     X-POSS
            ‘POSS has an X.’The ane construction is in near-complementary distribution with hoto, with respect to the
person of the possessor and the identity of the possessed. Constructions with ane tend not
to be used so much with third person possessors. They may be used for all manner of
possession: kin (including cosanguinal kin), body parts, or run-of-the-mill objects and
things). The equivalents of the hoto-constructions in (47) - (51) are presented in sentences
(55) - (59):

              ‘This ship has a new guard rail.’We can show that the NP is not nominative, despite being the sole argument in the clause,
as evidenced by the adjective - possessive order. Nevertheless, neither te nor na may
appear in place of ke, unless the possessed is topicalised, as in (55)’:      (55)'   Te      wunua _ to‘oge-su, ane.

              ‘As for my big houses, (it) exists’The structure of the above sentences is the same structure as the general existential
construction (chapter 14). A more literal translation of (55) might be ‘My big house
exists.” Compare the formal similarities of (55) with those in (55b), below:      (55)    b.    Ane         ke      wunua         to'oge i      iwo.

                    ‘There is a big house down there.’      Emphatically, ane may also take object suffixes:      (60)    Ane-'e      na      wunua-su!
              exist-30BJ] NOM     _house-1SG.POSS
              ‘I do so too have a house!’
              (more commonly, as areply:             ane’e!)Here too we see the nominative article being used on the object of emphatic possession,
despite the lack of applicative morphology that would make the oblique comitative
argument marked by ke(ne) a core one. The grammatical status of the nominatively marked
existant is, however, somewhat problematic, and is not the same as a nominative verbal
argument (see chapter 20 for a fuller discussion of the issues).
    The nominative article is also used when a numeral phrase or other adverbial
expression is used immediately after the verb, thus intervening between ane and the
                                                            Possession and possessive constructions   351existant. In this case the comitative preposition ke(ne) is replaced by the nominative article
na:              Ane         NUM-CLASS                   na        X-POSS
              exist       _NUM-CLASS                  NOM       X-POSS
              ‘POSS has NUM            Xs.’
The difference between this and the basic ownership expression using an existential clause
is in the emphasis: here we see an emphasis on the number of entities. An example of this
construction is (61):      (61)    Ane           gana-mia     na           ana-su.
              exist       4-CLASS        NOM          child-1SG.POSS
              ‘I have four children.’The formal differences between this ‘focussed’ construction (it presents more and detailed
information about the predicate) and the neutral construction can be seen in (62a) and
(62b):      (62)    a.    Ane       ke         loka-su                   dua-'asa.
                    exist     and             banana-1SG.POSS      2-CLASS
                      ‘I have two pieces of (fried) banana.’              b.    Ane       dua-'asa          na          loka-su.
                    exist     2-CLASS           NOM         _banana-1SG.POSS
                      ‘I have two pieces of (fried) banana.’     In (53) we saw that the verb hoto uses the normal verbal negator mbea(ka). In order to
present a negated version of a possessive clause using ane, the negative existential mbea'‘e
is used:      (63)    Mbea'e          na         mo'ane-su.
              not.exist   NOM      man-1SG.POSS
              ‘I don’t have a husband.’         (it is worth noting in passing that the -‘e ending on mbea’e is identical to the
         third person object marker, and may well reflect a historical origin in that
         morpheme, given the other morphosyntax associated with the construction.
         Synchronically, however, it is not separable)The only article that may be used with an NP that has not been fronted in this construction
iS na; contrastive focus is automatically present with any NP that has its existence denied.
Just as a more literal translation of the ane sentences is existential, such as for (55) ‘My
house exists’, so too is mbea’e, as in (63), more literally translated as ‘My husband does
not exist.” Compare (55b) with the negative existential clause in (64):      (64)    Mbea'e      na     wunua       to'oge i                      iwo.

"20.13.2       The category (S]}In chapter 3 the notion of a split [S] category was introduced in terms of unergative
subjects [Sa] and unaccusative subjects [So].”? There have been many reports of case
marking or verbal indexing that monitor the unergative/unaccusative split, but many fewer
of languages that monitor this difference syntactically; to my knowledge only Acehnese
(Durie 1985, 1987), Eastern Pomo (Maclendon 1978, Foley and Van Valin 1984: 95-97)
languages of the Dani family (e.g. Bromley 1981, C. Grimes p.c., own field notes), Bauzi
(David Briley p.c.) and Burmeso (own field notes) display split—intransitive switch-
references systems, showing split-intransitivity to be a phenomenon which extends beyond
the clause in which the verb is (such as the well described auxiliary choice in Indo-
European).
     The data from Tukang Besi suggests that in order to account for the treatment of the
subjects of intransitive verbs in different syntactic processes we need to recognise not two,
but three different groupings of intransitive subjects, those that have been referred to in
chapter 4 as the verbs taking an [Agent] subject (active verbs), those that have a [Dative]
subject (experiencer verbs), and those that have a [Theme/Patient] subject (non-active).
These last two are collapsed for some purposes in the larger category “unaccusative”. The
processes that differentiate these three groups of intransitive subjects are the ability to
participate in a comitative applicative construction with -ngkene (chapter 10), and the
ability to be the object of a factitive causative construction with hoko- (chapter 9).
Examples of these constructions on three verbs from the three different groups are
presented in the sentences in (127) - (132):
                                                  Pivots and grammatical relations     483           Active verb:

           ‘They went with him.’           Experiencer verb:
   (128) * No-mo‘aro-ngkene-'e.
            3R-hungry-COM-30BJ
           ‘They were hungry with him.","[508, 509]"
"Even in this stricter definition Pancana qualifies as symmetrical; for example, sentence
(176) shows both the objects indexed on the verb with object suffixes:                 Pancana:
                 Pronominalised applied and basic objects (on a ditransitive verb):
   (176)         No-waa-kainta-e.
                 3R-give-1PL.IN.OBJ2-30BJ
                 ‘They gave it to us.’Examining these criteria for Tukang Besi, we find that none of the applicative
constructions allow both objects equal access to be subject in a passive construction, to be
represented by means of an object marker, or to be bound with the subject in a reciprocal
construction. In all cases, if one object may display that property, the other may not. It
would seem that Tukang Besi is an asymmetric language. However, whilst no applicative
construction presents two objects that are accessible to the same grammatical process, the
268 Chapter 10
instrumental applicative does allow a reciprocal construction (combining the subject and the
base (theme) object) to cooccur with another process affecting the instrumental object, such
as indexing on the verb by means of the object suffixes (177a), being subject if the verb is
passive (177b), or heading an object relative clause (177c):    (177)   a.   To-po-simbi-simbi-ako-'e               na      hansu.

                 (Notice that simbi is not treated the same as tompa (section 10.6). It
                 belongs in the subclass of transitive verbs that allow for nominative
                 instruments (see chapter 4))   It is not possible to combine multiple object-affecting processes on a verb base which
does not include a reciprocal, for example, passive and object suffixes are not compatible
on the same verb form:   (178)    * No-to-simbi-ako-'e.
             3R-PASS-slash-APPL
             ‘They were chopped with them.’    Although Tukang Besi generally shows the properties of an asymmetrical language,
certain constructions with objects bearing instrumental semantic roles display some
features that would be consistent with a symmetrical interpretation. The data from Tukang
Besi indicates that rather than classifying a language, or even a construction, as
symmetrical or asymmetrical, each individual combination of grammatical construction,
semantic role, and transitivity needs to be separately examined. The behaviour of objects in
applicative constructions does not follow strict rules such that examination of one part of
the system can lead to sure predictions about the behaviour of other areas.

                           Other verbal morphology
11.1     Valency reducing affixesThere are several prefixes that are used derivationally to produce verbs with a lower
valency than that displayed by the underived verb. Most of these prefixes appear to be
incompatible with each other on the one verbal root, even though they can be shown
(through interaction with other prefixes) to occur in different positions (an exception to this
is that a verb whose valency has been increased by an applicative suffix, and so has more
than one object to discard, does allow multiple valency reduction, as does an object which
appears as the result of possessor ascension.). Both subject and object may be combined to
form a single subject through the use of the reciprocal prefix po-. The passive prefixes are
dealt with in section 11.2, and         serve to mark a verb in which the subject of the clause is
the affected argument (the one lowest on the thematic hierarchy), and do not allow for any
mention of the instigator of the action at all. At the other end of the verb, an object may be
incorporated into the verb, thus reducing the transitivity in a different way. This has been
dealt with in chapter 7.","[293, 294, 295, 296, 297]"

"4.4       NounsA noun can be identified on syntactic grounds by the fact that it always appears in an NP,
preceded by either an article (see 4.6.7) or a preposition (4.6.4). In citation, nouns are
most commonly preceded by the non-nominative core article te. A nominal can head an NP
without requiring any morphology to specify that it is serving in that role, such as the
derivational -‘a required on some ‘verbs’. Due to the extensive indexing of role
information    on    the   verb    in Tukang      Besi,    nominals    in core   function      occur   rather

 infrequently: a text of 130 verbal clauses (Wa Jambo, in the appendices) included
 approximately 30 nominals each in [S] and [O] role, and 10 in [A] role. The infrequency of
 nominals appearing in discourse, and the lack of any outstanding pre-syntactic criteria that
 they have, leads to there being few criteria for their classification. The system of numeral
 classifiers covertly divides the nominals into groups, but these are not absolute divisions,
 as one nominal may appear with more than one classifier, such as loka ‘banana’ (see
 4.6.6).","[116, 117]"
