"Personal Pronouns
   Throughout the preceding chapters we have seen how the role that personal
pronouns (“she,” “her,” “I,” “you,” “they,” etc.) play in a language like English is
filled by the system of noun and verb endings in Yup’ik. However we have also
seen how there is a role for personal pronouns as separate words in, for example,
the terminalis for subject of embedded transitive verb (see Chapter 18) as in:      Qanrutellruanga elpenun teglellruniluku. ‘She told me that you stole it’
          (elpenun is the 2nd person singular personal pronoun in the terminalis case).
      Aatavet wangnun navrallruyuksaaqan pelatekani. ‘Your father wrongly
          thinks that I borrowed his tent’ (wangnun is the Ist person singular
         personal pronoun in the terminalis case).",[398]

1. Actually the word teguugq is at least marginally possible given the right context both within
the sentence and without, so that for example ak’a teguuq could mean ‘it’s already been taken.’
Almost all of the forms said here to be impossible, are in fact at least marginally possible given
suitable contexts. Even an adjectival base such as take- can occur with a transitive ending in the
subordinative mood (see Chapter 13); one can say minggaa takluku ‘he is sewing it (making it) long.’
2. Information about verbs given in the vocabularies of previous chapters can be found in the
Yup’ik-to-English vocabulary at the end of this book and in the Yup’ik Eskimo Dictionary. The
category of each verb base in this book is explicitly stated in the English-to-Yup’ik vocabulary.

118                       GRAMMAR    OF CENTRAL ALASKAN YUP IK
Subject and Object with Transitive Verbs
    The grammatical cases used for subject and object with a transitive verb are
different than those used with an intransitive verb.
    If the object of a transitive verb is expressed with a separate noun, then that
                                                                        itive verb:
noun is put in the absolutive case, just like the subject of an intrans                                                                            ve verb
      Neqa neraa. ‘She is eating the fish. (The object neqa of the transiti
          here is absolutive as it is when it is the subject of an intransitive verb as
          in neqa taigug ‘the fish is coming.’)    If the subject of a transitive verb is expressed with aseparate noun, then that
noun is put in the relative case, just like the possessor of a possessed noun:
                                                                                     ve
      Arnam neraa. ‘The woman is eating it.’ (The subject arnam of the transiti
                                                                                      as
         verb here is relative as it is when it is the possessor of a possessed noun
         in arnam atkua ‘the woman’s parka.’)      Both subject and object may be expressed with nouns in the appropriate cases:      Arnam neraa neqa. ‘The woman is eating the fish.’      One must be fully aware that the role of the absolutive case shifts from indicating
                                                                               ve verb:
the subject with an intransitive verb to indicating the object with a transiti
                                                                                way:
      intransitive verb: subject (in absolutive case) does something or is some      Qimugta qilugtug. ‘The dog is barking.’
                                                                             some
     transitive verb: subject (in relative case) does something to, or bears
 relation to object (in absolutive case); for example:      Agayulirtem nunuraa qimugta. ‘The preacher is scolding the dog.’      This characteristic of the language, that the form or case used for the subject
                                                                         of the
 of the intransitive is the same as the form or case used for the object
 transitive, is called ergativity.
                                                                             are:
       Statements that give the (main) uses of absolutive and relative cases       Uses of the absolutive case:
           (1) subject of intransitive verb, as in qimugta qilugtuq
           (2) object of a transitive verb, as in gimugta nunuraa
       Uses of the relative case:
           (1) subject of a transitive verb, as in gimugtem qilugaa
           (2) possessor of another noun, as in gqimugtem pamyua.
                                      CHAPTER   EIGHT                                      119
   As has been stated before, word order is not as important in Yup’ik as in
English. In general however, the preferred word order is subject — object — verb,
though subject — verb — object is also common. Thus, the most common Yup ik
version of ‘the dog bit the man’ is qimugtem angun keggellrua, and the next
most common would be qimugtem keggellrua angun. Other orderings are
also possible, and in any event, case marking rather than word order in most
cases shows which one did the biting and which one got bitten.","[126, 127, 128, 129]"
"Classes of Words Where the Relationship Between Sound and Spelling is not One-to-One
     The members ofa small class of words could be written starting with either eC1V1C2V2 (were
Vi will have rhythmic length) or C1Vi1ViC2V2. That is, both spellings would represent exactly the
same sounds. For example, one could write either enituq or niitugq for ‘she hears’, and either
emituq or muutuq for ‘she is seeking medical aid.’ The decision which way to write these words
is determined by reference to other forms from the same word “base.” On these grammatical
grounds it turns out that the first word is best written niituq, and the second emutuq. For more
on this see the section titled “The Problem of Initial e in Yupik words” in the introduction to the
Yupik Eskimo Dictionary.
     There are two circumstances which allow certain written representations to be pronounced
in more than one way.
      One is caused by the “stress-repelling” abstract or “empty” bases ca ‘something, what thing’
and verbally ‘to do something, to do what’ and pi ‘thing’ and ‘to do (something).’ Even when these
bases occur in words with an initial closed syllable that initial syllable is not stressed in contrast
to usual initial closed syllable stress as described above. Thus, in contrast to the usual stress
pattern in, for example, ménqigctignarqug ‘she is probably drinking again,’ note the unusual
stress pattern (for some but not all dialects) in pingigcugnarqugq ‘she is probably doing
(something) again.’ There is no conventionalized way to orthographically indicate this sort of
unusual stress pattern, but then it only occurs with the two “empty” bases as indicated. Only
extremely rarely could it lead ambiguity. For more on this subject see the author’s paper “The
Stress Conspiracy and Stress-Repelling Bases in the Central Yup’ik and Siberian Yupik Eskimo
Languages”, in IJAL Vol. 50, No. 3, July 1984.
      The second circumstance is caused by a process known as (ar)-deletion, and the related
process of deleting a between r and q or g and q. Incertain cases a consequence of these processes
is that a syllable is stressed which would not otherwise be stressed. Thus, from qavarturartuq
‘she keeps sleeping,’ comes (optionally but most frequently) qavarturtuq where the stress on
the syllable tur is not in accordance the stress rules as discussed above. Such “ghost” stress has
been indicated orthographically with an apostrophe: qavartu’rtuq. Such ause of the apostrophe
is rarely consistently followed, in part because sometimes the syllable in question would be
stressed anyway as in qavarturtua ‘TT keep sleeping’ (where the two vowels in the following
16                         GRAMMAR     OF CENTRAL ALASKAN YUPIKsyllable give stress to tur), so that here the apostrophe is not needed. Writers often use this
apostrophe when it isn’t needed, or omit when it is needed. Speakers of the language know when
to stress the syllable in question even without the apostrophe, and if a learner of the language
were to omit the stress it would only very rarely cause ambiguity and probably never render the
spoken word incomprehensible. Perhaps this apostrophe could be considered “optional”. It would
be used in dictionaries, and, if a Yup’ik writer wishes to use this apostrophe, he or she may do
so. For more on this subject see   Jacobson 1985, and also the discussions of (ar) deletion and a
deletion between r/g and q in Chapters 8, 11, and 16 of the present book.

                Intransitive Indicative Verbs; Yes-No Questions
Types of Yup’ik Words, and Suffixes
   The majority of Yup’ik words are nouns and verbs. Nouns and verbs inflect,
that is, they change, taking various endings. There are also a few adverbs,
conjunctions, and the like, which do not in general inflect and which we shall call
particles. However, there are no articles, adjectives, prepositions or words in
some of the other categories familiar from English. Suffixes serve the same
functions in Yup’ik that these categories of words serve in English. Suffixation
is a very important and powerful process in Yup’ik, far more so than in English.
Only nouns    and verbs, and not particles (with certain exceptions), can take
suffixes. Unlike English, Yup’ik has virtually no prefixes, and, also unlike
English, Yup’ik does not form compound words.","[25, 26, 27]"
"      Those bases that can take both intransitive and transitive endings divide
into two groups. Those in one group mean ‘subject is V-ing’ or ‘subject is V-ing
something’ when used with an intransitive ending, and merely add a definite
object (‘subject is V-ing object’) when used with a transitive ending. The action
of the subject stays the same. These are called agentive verb bases. For example:      nuteg- ‘to shoot’; intransitive: nutegtuq ‘he shot’; transitive: nutgaa ‘he
          shot it’
      nere- ‘to eat’; intransitive: ner’ugq ‘he is eating’; transitive: neraa ‘he is
            eating it’
      qilug- ‘to bark’; intransitive: qilugtug ‘it is barking’, transitive: qilugaa ‘it
          is barking at him’     Those in the other group add someone (or something) that is acting on the
object causing it to V when used with a transitive ending. The subject of the
intransitive becomes the object of the transitive. These are called patientive verb
 bases. For example:      naveg- ‘to break’; intransitive: navegtugq ‘it broke’; transitive: navgaa ‘he
          broke it’
      kuve- ‘to spill’; intransitive: kuv’uq ‘it spilled, it is spilling’; transitive:
          kuvaa ‘he spilled it, he is spilling it’
      tamar- ‘to lose, get lost’; intransitive: tamartuq ‘it got lost’; transitive:
          tamaraa ‘he lost it’
                                           CHAPTER EIGHT                                        123     Often, but not always, the question of whether a particular verb base is
 intransitive-only, transitive-only, agentive, or patientive, will be exactly
 the same asin English (as is the case for the bases (except for gilug-) given
 in the examples above). A learner of Yupik need pay attention primarily in
 cases where Yupik and English differ. For an example of a case where the two
 languages differ, consider that “bark” is intransitive-only in English (one cannot
 say ‘it barks him’), but in Yup’ik qilug- is agentive as we have seen — one does not
 need   anything     in Yup’ik     to correspond      to the English     preposition     “at”; the
 transitive ending takes care of this. Conversely, in English “leave” isa transitive verb;
 one can say ‘I will leave the village tomorrow’, but in Yup’ik one cannot use ayag-
 ‘to leave’ with a transitive ending: *ayagciqaqa to mean ‘I will leave it’, but must
 rather use an intransitive ending on the verb and an ablative-modalis noun:
 ayagciqua nunamek unuaqu, literally ‘I will leave from the village tomorrow’.
      One should be aware that there is some variation from dialect to dialect and
from person to person concerning the category of various verb bases.","[132, 133]"
"     Yup’ik (and Eskimo in general) is very much a gender-neutral language. It
has no words comparable to “mankind” or “workman” which assume a certain
gender bias. Moreover in Eskimo languages the various morphemes indicating
third person singular are not marked for gender. Thus, the word that means ‘he
is here’ also means ‘she is here’ and ‘it is here,’ and the word for ‘she is asleep’ also
means ‘he is asleep.’ This situation leads to a certain problem in translating such
words into English. Even though accurate, it is extremely cumbersome to
repeatedly read (and write) ‘he, she or it is here’, ‘he/she is asleep,’ ‘3s is here’ or
‘(s)he is asleep’ and even worse to have to say something like ‘he or she is
putting his or her son to sleep in his or her own bed!’ To avoid such difficulties
as well as to avoid the objectionable aspects of routinely using the masculine
third person singular pronouns ‘he,’ ‘him’ and ‘his’ as a convention for ‘he or she,
‘him or her,’ ‘his or her’ (as has sometimes        been done in Eskimo       and other
grammars and dictionaries), in this book every even-numbered chapter uses only
x                       GRAMMAR   OF CENTRAL ALASKAN YUPIK‘he,’ ‘him’ and ‘his,’ and every odd-numbered chapter uses only ‘she’ and ‘her’ for
the third person singular (for humans that is; for non-humans of course the word
‘it? is used). Thus in an even-numbered chapter one should understand the
English gloss ‘he is asleep’ to mean ‘he or she is asleep,’ and in an odd-numbered
chapter one should understand the gloss ‘she is here’ as meaning ‘he, she or it is
here.’ The only exceptions will be cases where biology overrides such a conven-
tion, so that, for example, even in an even-numbered chapter one will see ‘she is
a mother’ rather than ‘he is a mother’ (even though the Yup’ik word itself could
also mean ‘he ...’). On the other hand, no allowance is made for culturally
determined gender roles no matter how fixed or traditional such roles are. Thus,
for example, in an even-numbered chapter one may find ‘he is sewing a parka’
(meaning ‘he or she is sewing a parka’), and in an odd-numbered chapter one may
find ‘she is hunting’ (meaning ‘he or she is hunting’).","[7, 8]"

                                       PREFACE
    The Central Alaskan Yup’ik Eskimo language, which is spoken in the Yukon-
Kuskokwim Delta and Bristol Bay areas of Southwestern Alaska, is one of four
(or possibly five) Yupik Eskimo languages. The others are Central Siberian
Yupik spoken on St. Lawrence Island and the Chukchi Peninsula of Siberia,
Naukanski spoken only on the Chukchi Peninsula, and Alutiiq (also called
Sugpiag, Suk, Pacific Gulf Yupik, and, loosely, Aleut) spoken around Prince
William Sound, the tip of the Kenai Peninsula, Kodiak Island, and the Alaska
Peninsula. These Yupik languages along with the Inupiaq or Inuit language
spoken in northern Alaska, northern Canada, and Greenland constitute the
Eskimo branch of the Eskimo-Aleut family oflanguages. The position ofSirenikski,
spoken only in Siberia and now nearly extinct, as another Yupik language or a
third branch of Eskimo (along with Yupik and Inupiaq/Inuit) has not been
definitively determined. The other branch of the Eskimo-Aleut family, Aleut, is
spoken on the Aleutian chain and the Pribilof and Commander Islands.
    In this book Central Alaskan Yup’ik will be mostly referred to simply as
“Yupik,” the apostrophe distinguishing the name from that of other Yupik
Eskimo languages.
    It is relevant to observe here that the term “Eskimo” is quite acceptable in
Alaska. This is in contrast to the situation in Greenland and especially in Canada,
where the term is often considered pejorative and “Inuit” is used instead. In
Alaska “Eskimo” is used as a label to include both Yupiks and Inupiagqs; the term
“Inuit” is too limited because it excludes Yupiks.
    At the present time (1995) there are approximately 20,000 (Central Alaskan)
Yup’iks, some 10,500 of whom speak their ancestral language. Children still
grow up speaking Yup’ik as their first language in about one-third of the Yupik
villages, mainly those on the lower Kuskokwim River, on Nelson Island, and
along the coast and in the tundra area between the Kuskokwim River and Nelson
Island. In the other Yup’ik villages most children grow up speaking English as
their first language and only the older generations still speak Yup’ik.","[2, 3, 4, 5]"
"Words Borrowed into Yup’ik
      Before the arrival of the Russians to the Yup’ik areas, the Yup’ik language
probably had relatively few words “borrowed” from other languages (compared
to the situation with European languages for example). There are however a
number of words, mostly animal and fish names, that are borrowed form Aleut
(which must be distinguished from words, called “cognates,” common to Aleut
and Yup’ik which go back to proto-Eskimo-Aleut times). These borrowings
include cagiq/sagig ‘halibut,’ uginagq ‘sea lion, issurigq ‘hair seal,’ and perhaps
issaluugq ‘porcupine’ (in Aleut this word means ‘birds take off in flight’; if the
Yup’ik word is in fact borrowed from Aleut, it could be because Yup’iks hold the
belief common elsewhere as well that porcupines shoot out their quills). There
are only a few Athabaskan words borrowed into Yup’ik, including luqruuyak,
the lower Kuskokwim word for ‘pike-fish,’ and nuuniq, a word for ‘porcupine’
used at the mouth of the Yukon. There are four Chukchi loans from Siberia:
kalikagq ‘paper,’ qusngiq ‘reindeer’ or ‘sheep,’ kuingigq ‘pipe, cigarette,’ and
qalqapak ‘axe.’
      The Russians brought new foods, tools, articles of clothing, domestic items,
religious doctrines, and domesticated animals. For these the Yup’iks generally
borrowed the Russian terms. Russian loans number about two hundred, though
certainly no speaker of Yup’ik uses all of them.! With one or two exceptions,
Russian loan words in Yup’ik are only nouns, not verbs, nor particles.
    The Russian words were adapted to the Eskimo sound system, for example
by replacing Russian “r’s (which are like English “r’s though rolled), with 1 (as
in Yup’ik piilitsaaq from Russian pérets, or kuluvak ‘cow’ from Russian
koroéva) or at the beginning of a word with al (as in Yupik Alussistuaq
‘Christmas’ from Russian ré6dzhestvo) and replacing Russian 6 “o”s
                                                                9)
                                                                   with u (as in
Yup’ik mulut’uuk ‘hammer’ from Russian molot6k). Russian unstressed “o” is
pronounced as “a” or shwa in some, but not all, Russian dialects, and this Russian
dialect situation is sometimes reflected in the Yup’ik loans (as in the two Yupik
forms muluk’uuk and malak’uuk ‘milk’ from Russian molok6). In no case was1. For a complete list of Russian, Athabaskan, Aleut, and Chukchi loans, see Yupik Eskimo
Dictionary, 678-89.
                                    CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR                                    439  a Russian “loan sound” introduced into the language (as happened in Aleut
                                                                            and
  Alutiiq which now have Russian (or English) “r’s in their loan words from
  Russian). Vowel length and consonant gemination in the Yup’ik word was
 formulated so as to duplicate the stress of the Russian original where possible
                                                                                  .
 This has led to a very distinctive stress pattern in Russian loan words; they tend
 to have long (doubled) vowels and often unusual gemination or lack of gemina-
 tion, though never anything which the pre-existent phonology of Yup’ik could not
 handle. Examples of this are yaassiik ‘box,’ kuluk’uunagq ‘bell,’ luuskaaq
 ‘spoon,’ kula’avkaagq ‘safety pin’ and and kuulicaag ‘chicken.’ Some Russian
 loan words start with 1, which is extremely rare in non-loan words; examples
                                                                              of
 such loan words are laavkaagq ‘store,’ and lumarrag ‘shirt, cloth.’            A number of
 loan words from Russian begin with st but for many people the Yup’ik form
                                                                           has
 acquired a voiceless barely audible e before the cluster, for example estuuluq
 ‘table’ (from Russian sto/).
      In contrast to the ready borrowing by Aleuts and Alutiiqs, hardly ever was
 a Russian    word adopted by Yup’iks for something with which Yup’iks were
 familiar before the arrival of the Russians. One counter-example, however, is
 uutkaagq ‘pintail duck’ (from Russian utka) used on the Yukon.
     In some cases, a new word has been coined for a new thing, rather than or
                                                                               in
addition to borrowing a Russian word. For example, ‘pencil’ is igarcuun or
alngarcuun (literally ‘device for marking or decorating’). Pencils were intro-
duced by the Russians, or at least while there were Russians still in Alaska after
1867, but these Yup’ik coined words are more common in most areas than the
Russian loan for pencil, kalantaaassaq (from Russian karanddsh). In some
cases a Yup’ik word acquired a new meaning. For example, nutek ‘gun’
                                                                              and
nuteg- ‘to shoot with a gun’ evidently formerly referred to the explosion of a
pocket of pitch in a burning piece of spruce wood.
    New things introduced by Anglo-Americans after the departure of the
Russians     often   were   given   coined   Yup’ik   words.   For   example,    ‘radio’   is
niicugnissuun, literally ‘device for listening,’ and ‘washing machine’
                                                                              is
igairissuun, literally ‘device for removing dirt,’ or ervigissuun ‘device
                                                                            for
washing clothes.’ However there are some items probably introduced as early
                                                                             as
the Russian colonial times which now have Yupik names borrowed from
English. An example of this is anainessaagq ‘onion’ borrowed from the
                                                                           English
plural “onions” (the pronunciation of the loan word is thoroughly Yup’ik as
                                                                            shown
by the reversal of a and i from anianessaaq which is also said and is closer
                                                                                 to
the English original). Then there is the word plipigq ‘baby,’ which is one case, at
any rate, where a borrowed word is used for a thing that had been around long
before Russians and Anglo-Americans arrived at the Yup’ik area! In more recent
times the practice has been to borrow the English word, as for example
snuukuugq ‘snow-go, snow machine,’ and tiiviig ‘TV.’
    There is a category of words used in Yupik which are English words that
haven’t been borrowed to the extent that piipiq or anainessaaq have. Their
phonology has not been adjusted to Yup’ik beyond the point of adding a Yup’ik
 440                       GRAMMAR    OF CENTRAL ALASKAN YUPIK ending and often more or less modifying the sounds in the English word,
 increasingly so toward the end of the word. The ending added is usually q for
 vowel-ending English words, and aq or aaq for consonant ending English words.
 Thus clinic-aaq where the final English “c” is geminated, and the first part of
 the word has, for some Yup’ik speakers, a more Yup’ik sound than this word has
when spoken English even by the same Yup’ik speaking persons. It might be
written kelinikaaq, although for some speaker the “cl” of the English is kept in
its English pronunciation. On the other hand, orange-aaq is sometimes pronounced
urincaagq where r is pronounced as English “r” rather than as Yup’ik r.","[448, 449, 450]"
"Note A
      Regional variants to the counting system include the following:
      Inglulgen is used for ‘eight’ (instead of pingayunlegen) in NR, LI, and Eg.
      Ipiag (from ipik ‘limb of quadraped’) is used for ‘twenty’ as a multiplier in Y, HBC, and Nun.
This means that yuinag is used in ‘twenty’ up to but not including ‘forty,’ and ‘forty’ is literally
‘two ipiaqs,’ rather than ‘two yuinags.’ Furthermore ipiaq as a multiplier is always singular
and comes after the number by which it is multiplied. So people who use this format say malruk
ipiaq for ‘forty’ rather than yuinaak           malruk,   and pingayun      ipiaq for ‘sixty’ rather than
yuinaat pingayun.
      Two areas have special words for ‘(one) hundred.’At the mouth of the Yukon a word kavluun
is used for this, while in some NR negavagq is used. Because of the undistinguished role of this
quantity (‘one hundred’) in the native Yupik base-twenty counting system, one expects that, as
in the case of tiissitsaaq ‘one thousand,’ these two words came from outside the language.
Kavluun is said by certain Yup’iks to have come from a Russian word for ‘percussion caps’ (used
in old-time rifles) which came in packages of one hundred, but a Russian source word has not been
definitely determined. Negavagq, by the nature and position of the sounds it contains does not
seem to be a Russian loan; it may come from some measurement of net mesh, since a single ‘mesh’
in a net is called a negagq (literally ‘snare’).",[440]

     the form nel’a® (because of the reluctance of the language to start words with ng, compare
     ngel’ar- ‘to laugh’ becoming nel’ar-), mengla® (where the m is probably from the m
      marking the relative case for the preceding possessor), and kengla® in HBC and Nun (where
      they also say kente- ‘water goes down,’ kenuur- ‘to nudge’, etc. in place of ente-, enuur-
      etc. elsewhere).
#4 The word pelatekagq ‘tent’ is from Russian, and is pronounced palatkaaq in NS. Apparently
     there is no non-loanword for ‘tent’ in Yup’ik, which is evidence that perhaps Yup’iks did not
     use tents before the Russian came, unlike the Inupiags who used skin tents and have a non-
     loanword for them. Or it may be that an older Yup’ik word for tent has been totally replaced
     by the Russian loan.
#5 Instead of tan’gerpak for ‘crowberry’ there is paunraq in NS, some Y, Nun, and Eg, and
     kavlakuaragq in HBC.
#6 Instead of tumagliq for ‘low-bush cranberry’ there is kitngik in NS and Y (?). The word
     kavirligq ‘red thing’ is also used as a name for this type of berry. ‘High-bush cranberry’ is
     mercuullugpak, and ‘bog cranberry’ is uingiar(aq) or uskutuliaraq in NS and Y.
#7 The words ugasqinarge- ‘to be slippery’ and ugasqite- ‘to slip’ are used in these forms in K
      above Bethel, upriver Y, some NR, and LI. These words are pronounced qurrasqinarge-
      and qurrasqite- in NS, downriver Y, NI, Can, K below Bethel, BB, and some NR. They are
      pronounced qurasqite-, and qurasqinarge- in HBC. The pronunciation or pair of forms
      with ug is one of the few cases of Yup’ik words with this sound other than the demonstratives
      augna, paugna, and qaugna and words derived from them (aug’ar- ‘to get out of the way,’
      and taugaam ‘however, but’). The other cases are ugasek ‘jackrabbit, tundra hare’ (NI and
      Can), and ugalguun ‘fishskin bag, quiver for arrows,’ and ugayar- ‘to pillage’ (also wayar-,
      and mayar-), ugaq’allaga- ‘to retch repeatedly’ (onomatopoeia; also waq’allaga-), qaugeq
      or qaugiigq ‘eider duck,’ and qaugyagq ‘sand.’Note A
      The participial mood in Alutiiq and Siberian Yupik, the closest languages to Central Yup’ik,
is the common way of expressing “past tense” (in narrative at least, in Siberian Yupik). This may
have been the original role of this verb mood in Central Yup’ik as well. The present-day Central
Yup’ik means of expressing “past tense,” that is by means of the postbase -llru-, is no doubt a
historically recent innovation. This postbase is clearly from -lleq ‘one that V-ed,’ and ~:(ng)u-
‘to be N,’ so that, for example, qilullruug ‘it barked,’ literally means ‘it is one that barked.’ This
postbase -llru-, is not used at all in NSU, where “past tense” as well as “present tense” is
expressed with the indicative unmarked for time. Possibly the present-day uses of the participial
are a remnant of its former broader use. On the other hand, the Inuit (especially Greenlandic)
verb form that corresponds to the Yup’ik participial (in function though not so closely in form) seems
to suggest that the present Central Yup’ik use may be closer to the original use of this verb mood.","[407, 408]"

"Indefinite Objects of Verbs; the Ablative-Modalis Case
     Nouns can also be used as the indefinite object of a verb with an ending from
Chapter 2, but then the noun must be changed from its citation form in the
absolutive case to another form called the ablative-modalis case. This is because
it is the ending of the noun which shows whether it is the subject or the object
of the verb, rather than the position of the noun in the sentence as in English.
For example in the sentence angun ner’uq kemegmek or angun kemegmek
ner’uq ‘the man is eating meat’ or ‘the man is eating some meat,’ the word
kemegmek is an indefinite object in the ablative-modalis case. Kemegmek is
said to be an indefinite object because another construction with a definite object
is used to express ‘the man is eating the meat.’ This latter type of construction
will be dealt with later in this book.
     The   ending   of the    singular   ablative-modalis   is ~%mek.   The   symbol   %
indicates that this suffix keeps some base-final consonants and drops others.
Suffixes marked with % can be called “half-retaining type” suffixes. The final
consonants that are kept are said to be strong and the final consonants that are
dropped are said to be weak.
     All base-final g’s are strong, as are all base-final r’s that are preceded by e.
Thus atkug- (the base for atkuk ‘parka’) ends in a strong consonant (g), asver-
(base for asveq ‘walrus’) ends in a strong consonant (r which is preceded by e).
Therefore the ablative-modalis forms of these nouns are atkugmek and
asvermek, where the strong consonant has been kept.
     Most base-final r’s that are not preceded by e are weak. Thus angyar- (for
angyagq ‘boat’) and uluar- (for uluagq ‘semi-lunar knife’) end in weak consonants
(rx preceded by a full vowel). Therefore the ablative-modalis forms of these nouns
are angyamek and uluamek, where the weak r has been dropped. However, a
minority of bases that end in r preceded by a full vowel have a strong final
consonant, and these are marked in this book with an asterisk, for example
kaviaq*, mikelnguq*, nayiq*, and qaiq* meaning ‘fox,’ ‘child,’ ‘ring seal,’ and
‘wave’ in the vocabulary for this chapter. There is considerable variation with
many of these unpredictably strong consonant-ending words, so that to some
speakers, kaviar- (the base for kaviagq ‘fox’) ends in a strong consonant while
to others it ends in a weak consonant. Therefore while the book prescribes
kaviarmek as the ablative-modalis form of this word, some speakers will say
kaviamek instead. Of course if the base ends in a vowel, whether a full vowel

ore, the question of weak vs. strong final consonant does not come up. The symbol
~ indicates that base-final e is dropped, as we have seen, so that the ablative-
modalis form of angun (with base form angute-) is angutmek.
    In the following examples note how the ablative-modalis ending ~7mek
drops weak base-final consonants, keeps strong base-final consonants, and drops
base-final e’s.","[42, 43]"
"
1. This second use explains the hyphenated name “ablative-modalis.” In Inupiaq/Inuit Eskimo
languages there are two separate cases, the ablative meaning basically ‘from,’ and the modalis
used for indefinite object. The endings of the two cases are different in Inupiag/Inuit. However
in all the Yupik Eskimo languages there is only case, one ending, for both uses or meanings. It
is not certain which is the innovation and which is the original pattern: separate ablative and
modalis cases now combined in Yupik, or a single ablative-modalis case now split in Inupiag/
Inuit. The modalis is also called the “instrumental” in works on Eskimo grammar.

Dropping of hatted e
    Sometimes when this postbase -li-, or another postbase, is attached to a base,
a hatted e arises, that is, an e which is in line to receive rhythmic length (see
Chapter 1). A hatted e is dropped, if doing so does not lead to a cluster of
two same (or almost same?) consonants. This is illustrated by the following
example, which, like the two examples after it, uses a word which is not in the
vocabulary list for this chapter.     urluveq   (base: urluver-) ‘bow for use with arrows,’ and postbase             -li- ‘to
        make, yield *urluvéli- which becomes urluvli- as in urluvliyugtua ‘I
        want to make a bow.’     If dropping hatted e causes I to come right after a stop consonant, then the
1 stays voiced as if the e were still there, and this is shown with an appostrophe.
This is one instance of a more general principle: ifdropping a hatted e causes
a voiced fricative or nasal to come right after a stop consonant or
voiceless fricative, than that voiced fricative or nasal stays voiced, and
this is indicated in the writing with an appropriately placed apostrophe. (Note
that this rule, ina way, compliments the rule given earlier stating that a fricative
or nasal which is voiceless because it immediately follows a stop consonant stays
voiceless even if e is inserted to break a three-consonant cluster).     issran (base: issrate-) ‘woven grass bag,’ and postbase -li- ‘to make,’ yield
         *issratéli- which becomes issrat’li- as in issrat’liyugtua ‘I want to
         make a grass bag.’     If dropping   such   a hatted    e would     cause   two   same   (or almost   same)
consonants, in this case two I’s, to be next to each other, then the e must be kept
because it is not permissible to have two same consonants next to each other.”
However e is not rhythmically lengthened because e cannot be lengthened in
Yup’ik. Here we invoke another general principle: ifa hatted e is not dropped,
then the following consonant is (automatically) geminated. (And this
gemination in effect closes the syllable with e, removing the “hat”). For example:     quagulek (base: quaguleg-) ‘three-edged needle for sewing skin,’ and
        postbase -li- ‘tomake, yield quaguléli- which is pronounced quaguleli-
        as in quaguleliyugtua ‘I want to make a three-edged needle.’     Even suffixes which drop final e’s, such as ~%mek, cannot lead to clusters
of two same consonants together, so that the final e is not dropped (or is dropped
1. Almost same consonants are c and t, and c and n.
2. Not counting gemination, but see Note C in the supplement to this chapter.

and reinserted), and if such an e      is hatted, then the following consonant is
(automatically) geminated. For example:    Tumemiek      tangellruunga.      ‘I saw   a footprint.’ (Compare    to: tumnek
        tangellruunga ‘I saw footprints.’)More Postbases
   The postbase -ngqerr- means ‘to have N’. It drops all final consonants.","[44, 45, 46, 47]"
"Vialis of Part of a Whole
     We have seen two uses of the vialis case: instrument and route. A third use
is to express the affected part of a whole to which something happens, as in the
following examples:    Qimugtevet keggellruanga irumkun. ‘Your dog bit me on my leg.’ (this
         is an alternative to qimugtevet keggellrua iruga ‘your dog bit my leg’!)
    Qercuallruuten-qaa ciutevkun? ‘Did you get frostbitten on your ear?’
       (this is an alternative to qercuallruuq-qaa ciuten? ‘did your ear get
       frostbitten?’)    Note that English prepositions do not correspond to Yup’ik oblique case
endings in a one-to-one manner. Compare the following three sentences where
“on” is translated into Yup’ik first by the vialis, then the terminalis and then the
localis:1. This alternative, and that to the next example, may represent a relatively recent innovative
pattern influenced by English.

"     The two words ak’allaq ‘old thing’ and nutaraq ‘new thing’ are nouns in
Yup’ik, while in English “old” and “new” are adjectives — a category of words that
does not exist in Yup’ik. Other devices are used to do the same thing in Yupik
that adjectives do in English. The examples below show how the two Yupik
words are used as appositives to other nouns, with ablative-modalis endings

 than changing the noun to a verb with ~:(ng)u-)

"    There are in fact a full range of personal pronouns in Yup’ik, in all cases and
numbers.
    First person personal pronouns are based on wa- or wang: which is probably
related to the base of the demonstrative adverb wani ‘right here.’ The other

base ete- ‘to be’ (see Chapter 7). The chart below reveals the irregularity of this
set of pronouns, and there is some variation especially with regard to the equalis
case. One will notice also that, except for the third person forms, absolutive and
relative are alike. The ablative-modalis and localis are formed similar to the
terminalis. Some of these personal pronouns, in particular the fourth person
absolutive/relative and certain of the duals, are not very common.","[398, 399]"
"     Differences between the examples, exercises and patterns given herein and
the speech of any Yup’ik-speaking reader are due to dialect differences or to the
fact that the language is changing rather rapidly now, and the speech of younger
speakers is often not the same as that of older speakers. In some cases the Yup’ik
herein represents older patterns of speech and in other cases it represents newer
patterns, though the patterns not presented are at least mentioned in footnotes
or supplementary sections if not in the text itself. It is no easy task to decide
whether to present conservative or innovative patterns. If conservative patterns
are presented as the standard in a language textbook, then the book could be
criticized for not keeping pace with the language as it is actually spoken today.
Conversely if innovative patterns are presented as the standard, then the book
could be criticized for endorsing a form of the language which younger speakers
themselves might well abandon as they grow older.
    Although the Yup’ik has been checked by native speakers, the exercises and
example sentences were written by the author, and may still in certain subtle
ways give evidence of the fact that they were composed by someone who is not
a native speaker of the language. Also, so as not to obscure the point being made,
some Yup’ik sentences are written in a style that, while valid, is not the most
idiomatic Yup’ik possible.",[8]

           A series of maps of the Yup’ik speaking area shows which villages use which word
     in cases where there are two or more Yup’ik words for one thing. Composite isogloss
     maps delineate the dialects, and contour maps show the relationships of the dialects to
     each other. The text comments on various aspects of each map, and the intriguing
     Aglurmiut dialect is discussed at length.

                         Yupik Phonology and Orthography
Letters Used
    Yup’ik has a different inventory of basic sounds than English, though there
is considerable overlap. Some Yup’ik sounds are exactly the same as English
sounds, and some Yup’ik sounds are almost but not quite the same as certain
English sounds. There are sounds in Yup’ik that English totally lacks and
conversely sounds in English that Yup’ik totally lacks.
    The   standard writing system for the Yup’ik language                represents Yup’ik
sounds by means of letters of the English (actually Latin) alphabet plus a very
few other symbols. Not all English letters are used, however. The letters and
symbols that are used are: a, c, e, g, i, k, 1, m,n, p,q, r,s, t, u, v, W,y and the
accent mark, the ligature, and the hyphen. Some of these letters represent
exactly the same sounds as they do for English, some only slightly different
sounds, and some completely different sounds. Also, some Yup’ik sounds are
represented by combinations of two letters (digraphs), just as are the English
sounds represented by ‘sh’ and ‘ch.’ Unlike English, the Yupik writing system is
(almost) perfectly precise in that, except for several small classes of exceptions,! a
given spoken word can have one and only one written representation, anda                given
written word can be pronounced in one and only one way. Thus, two words which
differ in pronunciation, nomatter how slight the difference, willbe written differently,
and a pair of homonyms (words that sound the same but have different
meanings) will be written exactly the same despite having different meanings.","[9, 10, 11]"

  Vocabulary Notes and Alternate Vocabulary
  #1 Akutaq, commonly called “Eskimo ice cream” in Alaska
                                                                n English, is a chilled mixture of
      berries, seal oil, sugar and shortening, often with
                                                           the addition of flaked or crumbled flesh
      of boiled fish from which the liquid has been squeezed, and/or
                                                                      mashed potatoes. Other types
      of akutaq have shredded boiled greens in them rather
                                                                  than berries. More generally the
      word akutagq can refer to any ‘mixture.’ This noun comes
                                                                    from a verb akute- ‘to make a
      mixture’, however, in  the absence of any context to the contrary, akutug
       ‘she is making “Eskimo ice cream,”, just as akutaq                        is understood as
                                                            is understand as ‘Eskimo ice cream’.
  #2 Instead of angyaq for ‘boat’, there is palayaq in BB,
                                                             NR and LI. Some speakers use both
       words, reserving palayaq for a ‘larger boat.’ The word palay
                                                                       aq may be from a Philippine
       language, brought to Bristol Bay by Filipino cannery worker
                                                                   s.    NS says angsaq rather than
       angyaq.
  #3 Instead of asveq for ‘walrus,’ there is kaugpak in NI,
                                                             HBC, and Nun, and gecigpak in LI
       and Eg. The word kaugpak means literally ‘big “kauk”, but
                                                                   this word kauk is not used alone
      in Central Yup’ik. An Inupiaq cognate of kauk means ‘edible
                                                                    layer of skin and fat of a walrus.’
  #4 Atkuk ‘parka’ refers only to a traditional Yupik pull-ov
                                                              er parka. A parka with a zipper, no
      matter how traditional   its design is otherwise, is referred to as a paltuuk,
       ullirtaag.                                                                        pal’tuuk, or
 #5 Instead of atsalugpiaq for ‘salmonberry, cloudbe
                                                       rry’, there is aqavsik in NSU, aqgevyik in
       HBC, atsarpiag in parts of Y, naunragq in NI and Can
                                                                 (Canineq - the coast between NI and
      K) (this word naunraq however means ‘plant’ outside
                                                                    of NI and Can), or just atsaq in
      various places (and this word atsaq is also the genera

      postbase -lugpiag is unproductive and found only a few
                                                               other words, including Kass’alugpiaq
      ‘Russian’ from kass’aq ‘white person’ (see below). Eviden
                                                                 tly -lugpiaq means something like
      ‘original N’.
 #6 Instead of elitnaurvik for ‘school,’ there is elicar
                                                         vik in some Y and some HBC, elissarvik
      in some NI, naaqivik in NS, (e)skuulag or (e)sku

 #7 The word estuulug ‘table’ is from Russian. It may also
                                                           be pronounced, and therefore spelled,
      stuulu g or cetulug. Some Russian loan words violate
                                                           certain genera  l characteristics of
     Yup’ik words such as the the limitation requiring that
                                                            a word not start with a consonant
     cluster. The form    closest to the original Russian is stuuluq,      and the other two forms
     constitute efforts by the Yup’ik language to make this word
                                                                    become more Yup’ik, so to speak.
#8 The meaning of the word ikamragq ‘sled’ has been extend
                                                                  ed to include also ‘snow machine,’
     and even ‘car’ or ‘truck.’ Instead of ikamraq there is qamau
#9 The word kass’aq ‘white person’ comes from the Russia               k in NS.
                                                               n word which has entered English as
     “Cossack.” The Cossacks were a group of Russians
                                                             famous as frontiersmen, explorers and
     enforcers of the will of the tsars. In some of NR, LI and Eg
                                                                   kass’aq means ‘priest’ (including
     Natives who are Christian priests), and kassaakagq is ‘white
#10 Instead of kenir- for ‘to cook,’ there is ega-
                                                                        person.’

     literally ‘to provide with fire,’ which is the meaning it

     Can, traces of the te can be seen in words used elsewhere
                                                                as well, as in the lin mikelnguq
     ‘child,’ which comes from te (see postbase @nguq in Chapte
                                                                   r 14).
#13 The word nutek ‘gun’ is a nominalization of the verb
                                                          base nuteg- ‘to shoot,’ which originally
     seems to have meant ‘to pop, crackle, explode,’ like
                                                          pitch in spruce wood does in a fire.
#14 In addition to pengug for ‘hill’ there is qemiq.
#15 The word suupagq ‘soup, stew’ is from Russian reinfo

#16 With the base tangerr., ‘to see,’ the postbase -nrite-

    form tangenrituq and also tangenrrituq for ‘he doesn’t

    the second form, apparently the voicelessness of the
                                                                base-final back velar fricative is
42                          GRAMMAR     OF CENTRAL ALASKAN YUPIK    transferred to the same fricative in the postbase.
#17 The word uluagq ‘semi-lunar knife, woman’s traditional Eskimo-style knife’ has entered
    English (or at least the English or writers and speakers about Eskimo things) in the form
    of its Inupiaq cognate “ulu.” Instead of uluaq, the word kegginalek is used in HBC and
    Nun. In Can the word uluagq is used for any type of cutting knife.
#18 The word yuk ‘person’ is pronounced, and therefore spelled, cuk in Chevak (but not in
    Hooper Bay where it is yuk), and in Nun (actually pronounced with a voiceless g rather than
    k), Almost all words which elsewhere begin with y followed by a single vowel begin with c
    in HBC, Nun and Eg. This word becomes suk in some small parts of Y. The meaning of yuk
    is broader than just ‘person,’ it can mean ‘child’ in the sense of ‘offspring,’ “Yupik Eskimo,’
     or ‘animating spirit’ in certain contexts.
#19 The word yup’ik means literally ‘real person’ or more accurately perhaps ‘authentic person’
     or ‘our original kind of person.’ In Chevak (and Nun) this word is cup’ik, and some people
     in K and BB prefer yupiaq since there -piag rather than -pik is the more common postbase
     for ‘real, authentic N.’Note A
    In the HBC dialect the ablative-modalis case endings are ~%meng and ~%neng instead of
~%mek and ~%nek as elsewhere. So HBC says, for example, akutameng neryugtua for ‘I want
to eat Eskimo ice cream,’ and tumneng tangertua for ‘I see some tracks.’Note B
     We've seen how a word formed with the postbase -li-, ‘to make,’ can be shortened by deleting
1 and the preceding vowel, so that suupaliuten-qaa? ‘are you making soup?’ can be shortened
to suupiuten-qaa? There is a special problem when a noun ends in two vowels followed by a
consonant. An example of such a noun is kuuvviag ‘coffee.’ The long form for ‘are you making
coffee?’ is kuuvvialiuten-qaa? but a short form also exists for some, but not all, Yup’ik speakers.
The expanded base kuuvviali- ‘to make coffee,’ can be shortened to kuuvvii-, and then, when
using an ending such as +(g/t)uten, it is necessary to use the (g) after the two vowels:
kuuvviiguten-qaa? ‘are you making coffee?’Note C
     Hatted e will not be deleted if doing so leads to a cluster of two same consonants, and an e
will be inserted to break such a cluster which may arise through word construction with an e
dropping suffix (such as ~%mek). Thus one will not get pp, mm, etc. in a word. This same holds
for clusters of “almost same” consonants, in particular the clusters ct and cn.
     However, in the HBC dialect such same and almost same clusters are permitted. For clarity,
and to avoid ambiguity in some cases, an apostrophe is used to separate the two like consonants.
Thus in HBC *quaguléliyugtua does lead to quagul’liyugtua ‘I want to make a three-edged
needle,’ and tum’meng rather than tumemek (as elsewhere) is the singular ablative-modalis
of tuma®. The clusters I’l and m’m here are different from geminated ] and geminated m in that
breath is released for a very short duration of time between the two I's or two m’s of the cluster.
     In the NSU dialect hatted e is not deleted even between unlike consonants, but rather the
consonant following the e is always geminated. People there would say urluveliyugtua for ‘I
want to make a bow.’ Furthermore, in the NSU dialect many e’s come to the surface, so to speak,
 within morphemes in places where they have been deleted as hatted in other dialects and where
 their underlying existence would be at best suspected without recourse to NSU (and/or Eskimo
 languages other than Central Yup’ik). For example, non-NSU Central Yup’ik has it’gaq ‘foot’
 where the voiced status of g (as indicated by the apostrophe) suggests a deleted hatted e between
 it and t. Siberian Yupik itegaq and Inupiaq/Inuit isigak or itigak for ‘foot’ add evidence of this,
 and indeed NSU has itegaq.

44                       GRAMMAR   OF CENTRAL ALASKAN YUP IK
Weak Initial e
   The word [e]na® ‘house’ requires a special explanation. The square brackets
                                                                              e, in
around the initial e of the word (called a weak initial e) indicate that this
addition     to being barely audible as initial e’s generally are, will drop           off
                                                                          conso-
altogether as suffixes are added. In compensation, so to speak, the first
nant of the suffix will be geminated         whenever     possible. For example,      the
                                                                            from
ablative-modalis of this word is nem’ek as in an’uq nem’ek ‘he is going out
the house’; one says nel’iyugtugq ‘he wants to build a house’, but nengqertuq
the has a house’ (without gemination since another consonant follows the first
                                                                           of
consonant of the suffix making gemination impossible). There are a handful
other words with weak initial e.
    For more information on this word see Note A in the supplement to this
chapter.","[50, 51, 52, 53, 54]"
"Equalis Case
    The other case is the equalis, the ending of which is %tun in the singular and
%cetun in the plural. It essentially has only one use and means ‘like (a) N’. This
use has been extended to include ‘in the language of N’ as the examples below
illustrate.
     There is often little difference between using the singular equalis and the
plural equalis. The reason for this is that when one thing is said to be similar to
asecond thing, then it could just as well be said to be similar to others of the same
type as that second thing, and when several things are said to be similar to a
second group, then they could just as well be said to be similar to one member of
that second group.",[84]
"Place Names
    Many, but not quite all, Yupik place names are analyzable or partially
analyzable. For example, the Yup’ik name for Bethel, Mamterilleq, means ‘one
that had lots of caches or smokehouses’ from mamterag ‘cache, smokehouse.’
This word mamteraq is not at present used in the Bethel area but is still in use
on the Yukon. It also appears in the Yup’ik name for Goodnews Bay, Mamterat.
Even place names that cannot be analyzed such as Tuulkessaag ‘Tuluksak’ are
almost certainly not names from another language; they have all the phonologi-
cal earmarks of Yup’ik words. This shows that in ancient days Yup’iks probably
did not move into territory already occupied at that time by another ethnic group.
If Southwestern Alaska had had other inhabitants when the Yup’iks arrived, one
would expect their place names to have survived (even if the people and their
language did not survive). One can see this in the many American place names
from Indian groups, such        as “Mississippi,”   “Massachusetts,”   and in Alaska
“Tanana,” and “Sitka.”
    In some cases a place name will become analyzable when one looks at another
Eskimo language. To give an example, there is a place on Nunivak Island called
Qikmirtalek. The postbase +talek means ‘one with lots of N,’ but the base
qikmigq is not known in Central Yup’ik. Qikmiq, however, is used in Alutiiq,
Siberian Yupik and Inupiaq (in the form ginmiq, gipmig or gimmiq) as the word
for ‘dog.’ The Nunivak place name Qikmirtalek probably dates from a time
when the word qikmigq was used at least in that part of Central Yup’ik. The
meaning of the name “Nunivak” itself can be determined from Siberian Yupik
where it means ‘tundra’ and ‘rosewort.’ (The form nunivak is exactly the
Siberian Yupik form; on Nunivak Island itself the form of the name is Nunivaagq.)
                               CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR                               437

"Note B
    Even in cases where there is no connection at all between two events other than their
occurring at the same time the consequential mood is still used sometimes:        Qavallruuten itrama. ‘You were asleep when I came in.’     Use of the consequential here — rather than another mood, the first contemporative itlemni
(see Chapter 17) which literally means ‘when I came in’ without causal connection between the
events — is probably a holdover from the time before the first contemporative was added to the
language. The first contemporative is clearly a “spin-off” from the localis case and its absence from
most other Eskimo languages marks it as a relatively recent innovation in Central Yup’ik. In
other Eskimo languages the consequential covers both causality and coincidence in time in the
past, and this was no doubt the original pattern in Central Yup’ik as well.",[298]

   In addition to showing case (absolutive, ablative-modalis etc.) and number
(singular, plural, dual), endings for nouns can also indicate the person and
number of a possessor. That is, they can show who owns something, which in
English is shown by a possessive pronoun such as ‘my,’ ‘your,’ ‘our,’ ‘his,’ etc. In
this chapter a selection of the more common possessed absolutive endings with
1st and 2nd person possessor are presented.","[66, 67, 68]"
"Demonstrative Adverbs
   Just as in English there are demonstrative pronouns (“this,” “that”) which
are used for things, and demonstrative adverbs (“here,” “there”) which are used
for locations, so in Yup’ik corresponding to each demonstrative pronoun there is
a demonstrative adverb. With some exceptions and/or modifications, the demon-
strative adverb base is derived from the fundamental demonstrative base by
adding a, sometimes with velar dropping having occurred as a historical process.
     There are no absolutive case forms nor is there a singular/plural/dual
distinction for demonstrative adverbs.
    The ending for the localis is +ni, just like the ordinary plural localis ending.
So from the pronoun pikna with fundamental base pik- comes demonstrative
adverb base pika- and hence localis pikani (at) up there.’
82                        GRAMMAR    OF CENTRAL ALASKAN YUPIK     For the other cases, there is a special set of case endings for the demonstra-
tive adverbs. The ablative-modalis ending is .ken, hence pikaken ‘from up
there.’ The dot written in front of the ending shows that this ending only goes on
vowel-ending bases without making any changes at the juncture. The terminalis
is .vet, hence pikavet ‘to up there,’ and the vialis is .ggun.
    Here is a list giving the more common demonstrative adverb forms from the
demonstrative pronouns given above for memorization with this chapter:demonstrative pronoun                    demonstrative adverb
una ‘this’ (restricted)                  wani ‘right here in front of me’

adverb, is often a matter of style or emphasis more than meaning, as the
following examples, concerning a bird on a branch of a tree above us, illustrate.","[91, 92, 93]"
"Nouns as Subjects of Verbs
    A noun in its citation form (and in other absolutive forms) can serve as the
subject of a verb in the 3rd person as discussed in Chapter 2. Note that the
citation form is singular so the verb must be singular too. In the next chapter we
shall see how to form absolutive plural and dual. Some examples of nouns being
used as subjects of verbs are:    Angun ner’ug. ‘The man is eating.’
    Uluag assirtuq. ‘The semi-lunar knife is good.’
    Arnaq qavaryugtuq. ‘The woman wants to sleep.’
    Yuk-qaa pissurtuq? ‘Is the person hunting?’
    Cali-qaa kuimaryugtugq mikelnguq? ‘Does the child still want to swim?’
    Yup’ik arnaq yurartugq. ‘The Eskimo woman is dancing.’Appositives
    In the last example above, both Yup’ik and arnaq are the subject; the two
words are said to be appositives, meaning that they fill the same role in the
sentence and stand for the same thing. Appositives play a big role in Yup’ik, in
part providing the apparatus that serves the same function as adjectives in
English.",[41]
"      Mikélnguyagagq iqvartudq. ‘The little child is picking berries.’ (Rather than
         *mikelnguq iqvayagartuq.)    There are several other postbases that also have this property of applying to
the subject of the verb if there is no separate noun as subject. One is -Ikuk ‘darned
N and -lkug- ‘darned one is V-ing.’      Arnalkuk ataam qenertuq. ‘The darned woman is angry again.’
      Ataam qenertelkugtuq. ‘The darned one is angry again.’     This postbase may be affixed to the absolutive singular form of a demonstra-
tive pronoun: ingnalkuk ‘thatover there darned one.’      Another postbase which is used on a verb base to apply to the subject if there
is no separate noun for the subject. This is the postbase -r(ur)luq*/-r(ur)lur-
meaning ‘dear (poor) (old) N,’ and ‘dear (poor) (old) one is V-ing.’
     This postbase assumes several forms depending on the termination of the base.
     With a base that ends in a vowel or in a vowel plus r where the vowel would have
rhythmic length if followed by CV, then this postbase takes the form -’urluq*
and -’urlur-. As we have seen before, the apostrophe between vowels indicates
that the preceding consonant is not geminated.      qaya’urlug ‘dear kayak’
      Qava’urlurtuq. ‘The dear one is sleeping.’    With a base that ends in a vowel or in a vowel plus r where the vowel would not
have rhythmic length if followed by CV, then this postbase takes the form -urluq*
and -urlur- (or ’urlug* and -urlur-, where the apostrophe is the optional
apostrophe indicating here that the syllable ending in ur has extra stress’), and
the ur represents an r made with the lips rounded.      angyaurlug (i.e. angya’urluq) ‘dear boat’
      mingquteurlugq      (i.e. mingqute’urluq)        ‘dear needle’ (because   ur is a
         consonant and not a vowel plus a consonant, this is not a case of e
         clustering with another vowel; some Yup’ik speakers geminate the t
         getting mingqut’eurlug (i.e. mingqut’e’urluq))

 but,
        Arnaurlug (i.e. arna’urlugq) iqvartugq. ‘The dear woman is picking berries.’        With bases that end in g this postbase takes the form +urluq* (or +eurluq*) and
+urlur- (or +eurlur-).        acagurluq (or acageurlugq) ‘dear old auntie’
        ayagurlurtuq (or ayageurlurtugq) ‘the dear one is leaving, or left’        The reason for the several forms of this postbase is that the actual form
underlying them all is -rurluq*, and -rurlur- where with a base ending in g the
initial r of the postbase will be replaced by g. The syllable rur, but not gur, will
then be simplified to ur and the syllable it closes will get stressed if it isn’t
stressed otherwise. Any rhythmic length from the underlying stage is preserved.
The operation of this postbase is similar to the phenomenon whereby rar is
simplified to r with extra stress or rhythmic length preserved (compare the
postbase @+’(g/t)ur(ar)- in Chapter 11). To illustrate:    from qayaq comes *qayarurluq hence “qayaurluq” which would be written
        qaya’aurlugq, and this in turn sounds exactly the same as, and is
        therefore written as qaya’urluq
    from angyaq comes *angyarurlug hence angyaurlug (i.e. angya’urluq)
    from acak comes acagurlug (or acageurlugq) without simplification

        This postbase is found as a part of several common words where at the
present time the original bases are seldom or never used:    V maurlug ‘grandmother’ (from a base which is no longer used)
    V apa’urlugq ‘grandfather’ (from apa which is also used for ‘grandfather’)
    V tan’gaurlug ‘boy’ (from a base which is no longer used but occurs in
        tan’gurraq another word for ‘boy’)
    V nasaurlug ‘girl’ (from a rarely used word for ‘girl’)
    V tutgara’urlugq ‘grandchild’ (from tutgar(aq*) which is also used for
        ‘grandchild’)     This postbase can be used with particles and pronouns, which ordinarily
don’t take postbases:    ciiurlug ‘why, dear one’
    elpeurlug (i.e. elpe’urluq) ‘dear you’

"Yup’ik Naming Practices
    ‘A newborn baby is given the Yup’ik name of the most recently deceased
person in the community even if that person was not of the same sex. Further-
more, several newborn babies may be given the same Yup’ik name if they are all
born before another death has occurred. A person who has the same name as one
is one’s atellgun ‘name-sharer.’ This may be the reason that the same name may
be found in different, often widely separated villages, though it may also be as in
English that there are just some names that are fairly common in the particular
ethnic group.
    Yup’ik names are sometimes common nouns as well. For example, there are
people named Arnaq ‘woman.’ However, many names, for example Tukayak,
are not analyzable. Some names are analyzable only by going outside the village
where they are found. For example, there are people named Ikusek in lower
Kuskokwim villages, where this word is “just a name,” but outside this area
ikusek is the word for ‘elbow,’ while in the lower Kuskokwim cingun, literally
‘device for pushing’ is used for ‘elbow.’
     It is thought that this is because of an old pre-Christian naming taboo
practice. According to this theory, after a person had died his name would not be
uttered until a newborn baby had received that name. If the name was also a
common noun, such as a word for ‘elbow,’ then a new noun was coined for that
thing until such time as the old word could safely be used again when the
temporary coined word would be discarded. Sometimes, however, the coinage
remained in use and the old formerly common noun became just a personal
name. Evidence for this is that many of the nouns used only in particular areas
(usually the lower Kuskokwim and Bristol Bay) where the noun used elsewhere
for that thing is a person name, are descriptive word coinings as in the case of
cingun discussed above. Also the practice of name taboo had been observed in
pre-Christian times in various Eskimo communities, and the retention of
substitute common nouns in the manner described above was observed in
practice in East Greenland in the late 1800s.
     Many Yup’ik names have the otherwise uncommon gemination pattern as in
Mecaq’aq or Anaq’aq.
     Yup’ik names are often shortened in use (especially when used as vocatives)
so that, for example, Tukayak, can become Tuka’ay or even Tuuk. Also names
are subject to a great deal of word-play which may involve expansion of the name
with suffixes, or changing of the name      to something similar sounding. Nick-
names are also fairly prominent in Yup’ik culture, and sometimes English names
or words get involved in the nicknaming.
    An adult or older child will talk to a baby using certain made-up words or
phrases   which   in tone   at least (since they   are   often meaningless)   express
438                      GRAMMAR   OF CENTRAL ALASKAN YUPIKfondness and which become unique to that baby and may be used by other adults
or older children as well. The verb here is inqaa ‘he is talking to him in this way.’
Also: inqiugq ‘he is talking to someone in this way, inqutaq ‘the particular
made-up words or phrases used for possessor,’ ineqsunarqug ‘he (baby) is cute’
(literally ‘is such that it causes one want to talk to him in this way’).","[447, 448]"
"Localis Case
    Still another noun case, the localis case indicates the place at which
something occurs.” The localis case is marked by ~%mi in the singular and by
~%ni in the plural, and thus is also like the ablative-modalis and the terminalis.",[57]
"Automatic Devoicing of Consonants
     There are several types of spelling conventions whereby due to their position
in the word certain letters are pronounced differently than their basic description
(as above) would suggest. These conventions take advantage of certain regulari-
ties in the language. These regularities are so strong, in fact, that they are almost
forced upon the writing system.
     One such convention can be termed automatic devoicing from a reader’s point of
view, or fricative undoubling from a writer’s point of view. Because a fricative sound
is generally voiceless if it occurs next to a stop or next to another voiceless fricative,
it should not really be necessary to explicitly indicate its voicelessness by writing
it double in those positions. This has led to the following rule: a fricative is
written single next to a stop and pronounced voiceless. For example, the 1
in qelta ‘scale’ is voiceless (that is, like Il) because t is a stop, and the v in ekvik
‘river bank’ is voiceless (that is, like vv) because k is a stop.! Unlike English where
a voiced fricative such as “1” often occurs next to a stop as in “alto” or “apply,” in Yupik
consonant clusters rarely have a mixture of voiced and voiceless consonants.”
     The motivation for this rule is not merely to make written words shorter
(though given the fact that words in Yup’ik — and Eskimo languages in general
— are often quite long, this is no trivial consideration). In addition, it is often the
case that a given word “core” will have a voiceless fricative when used with a
suffix that begins with a stop, but will have the corresponding voiced fricative in1. Thus, the rounded fricative ug as in augna ‘the one going away’ becomes voiceless when next
to a stop as in augkut ‘the ones going away,’ however the voiceless counterpart of ug is written
w, so this work augkut could also be written awkut.
2. Recall that Yup’ik stops are voiceless. One category of exception to the general prohibition of
mixed clusters is that a nasal followed by a stop or voiceless fricative will be voiced. This is
discussed latter in this sections, as are the infrequent cases that violate the general prohibition.
                                       CHAPTER ONE                                          7 the same place when used with a suffix that begins with a vowel (or voiced
 consonant), and this situation makes the undoubling rule very natural and
 compelling. For example in qilugtug ‘it is barking’ and qilugaa ‘it is barking at
 her,’ the common core conveying the idea of barking is qilug-, and the g is
 voiceless in qilugtugq, since it is next to the stop t, but voiced in qilugaa.
 Whether this sound is voiced or not depends only on the nature of the following
 sound, and is not a feature of that common core. Were we to require that the first
of these two words be written “qiluggtuq” with a gg to show voicelessness, it
would be very natural for Yup’ik speakers and for learners who are internalizing
the language to persistently forget to write a double g. Thus, on account of the
rule stated above, one will never see a fricative written double next to a stop.
    A second rule says: a fricative that follows a voiceless fricative is
written single, but pronounced voiceless. For example, in pillruug ‘he did
it,’ the r is voiceless because it follows the voiceless fricative Il, and similarly in
inarrvik ‘sleeping bag’ the v is voiceless. Thus one will see two singly written
fricative letters (and hence voiced fricatives) next to each other, for example in
asriq ‘naughty child,’ or a doubly written fricative letter followed by a singly
written fricative letter (both voiceless due to the rule), for example in issran
‘grass bag,’ but never two doubly written fricative letters together nor a singly
written fricative letter followed by one written double.
   Additionally, an r at the end of a word, or an s at the beginning of a
word are written single but pronounced voiceless. For example, r in
necuar ‘little house’ and the s in suugiug ‘she is scrubbing the floor’ are
voiceless, but the 1 in luussitag ‘horse’ is voiced (but see footnote 1, p. 12).","[16, 17]"
"Examples
noun base           with postbase                   with postbase and ending
nuna- ‘land’        *nunangite- —> nunaite-          nunaitug ‘she lacks land’
ui- ‘husband’       uingite- (velar kept)           uingitug ‘she lacks a husband’
neqe- ‘fish’        *neqengite- —> neqaite-         neqaitugq ‘it lacks fish’
                           (see below)
angyar- ‘boat’      ‘“angyarite- —> angyaite-       angyaituq ‘she lacks a boat’
atkug- ‘parka’      *atkugite- —> atkuite-          atkuitug ‘she lacks a parka’
qair- ‘wave’        qairite- (velar kept)           qairitug ‘it lacks waves’    A few comments are in order here. First, whether a velar is dropped or kept
with this postbase doesn’t depend at all on whether the velar is weak or strong.
Rather, the velar ng, g, or ris dropped ifand only if itis flanked by single vowels,
and this explains why the velar is kept in uingite- and qairite-. In the case of
*neqengite- becoming neqaite-, there is a general rule whereby engi becomes
ai when the ng is velar-dropped.
     Another general rule says that when a suffix that starts with a vowel is added to
a base ending in er or eg, then the e of the base (called the semi-final e) is dropped.nater- ‘floor’        natrite- (velar kept)        natrituq ‘it lacks a floor’
38                      GRAMMAR   OF CENTRAL ALASKAN YUPIK
     If this leads to a three-consonant cluster, then an e is reinserted, but a velar
following such a reinserted e is not subject to velar-dropping. The e may be
reinserted between the first and second consonants of the cluster or between the
second and third.asver- ‘walrus’       *asvrite- (velar kept)      asveritug or asevritugq ‘it lacks
                         —> asverite- or             walruses’
                         asevrite-     The word nuliag ‘wife’ is a special case. The base can be regarded as either
nuliar-, in which case this postbase gives nuliarite-, or as nulirr-,in which case
this postbase gives nulirrite-, and velar dropping does not apply to the voiceless
fricative. Both nuliaritug and nulirritug are common for ‘he doesn’t have a wife.’Lexicalizations
    Some combinations of this postbase with particular bases should be consid-
ered as bases in their own right and should be learned as such just as if they were
words presented in the vocabulary section of the chapter. This happens with
other postbases as well as with the one in question. These combinations are said
to be lexicalized which is to say that the meaning of the combination in question
is not totally predictable from the meanings of the individual parts. English also
has many lexicalizations including “washing machine,” which is understood not
as any machine for washing anything, but specifically as a machine for washing
clothes, and “hot dog,” which of course isn’t a dog at all. In this book lexicalized
combinations will be indicated with a checkmark, that is, with the symbol ”
For example, kemek ‘flesh’ and the postbase :(ng)ite- (with an ending) lead to
V kemgituq which means literally ‘she doesn’t have meat or flesh’, but which is
 understood by Yup’ik speakers as meaning ‘she is skinny.’ The base V kemgite-
 is considered to be lexicalized because ‘to be skinny’ is not entirely predictable
 from the literal meaning ‘to not have meat or flesh.’ The reader should memorize
 kemgitug ‘she is skinny’ as another verb in the vocabulary of this chapter.
     The same check mark will be used for combinations where the meaning is
 predictable but which correspond to a single English word or concept and
 therefore should also be memorized as bases in their own right. An example of
 this is that imag ‘contents’ and the postbase in question (with an ending) yield
 V imaituq ‘it does not have contents’ which (predictably) corresponds to the
 English ‘it is empty.’ The check mark indicates that imaitugq should be memo-
 rized as the Yup’ik verb for ‘it is empty.’ That way when translating from English
 to Yup’ik one won't always have to follow this chain of thoughts: “empty’ equals
 ‘not have contents,’ ‘contents’ is imaq and ‘not have’ is :(ng)ite-, so ‘not have
 contents’ is imaite-, and therefore that is the Yup’ik for ‘empty” (nor should one
 have to follow a similar multi-step chain of thoughts to get from the Yup’ik
 imaite- tothe the English ‘empty’), but rather go from ‘empty’ directly to imaite-
 (and likewise going from Yup’ik to English).

          Bibliography of Newly Published Materials in Central Yup’ik     Since the first printing of this book (1995), it has become apparent that many students
can benefit from further exercises. The following pages, added in the third printing (2000),
contain such additional exercises. I would like to thank my wife Anna for examining these
exercises and calling to my attention those items which were incorrect or awkward.
     It should be understood that many students—depending on their interests, back-
ground, and orientation—will want or need conversational (or more precisely, oral/aural)
practice rather than written exercises such as these.","[555, 556, 557, 558, 559]"

embedded        transitive verb (see also Chapter       18). Thus:

 (Chapter 14) coming after the postbase in question, rather than with the verb-
 to-verb postbase +ciqe-/@ciiqe- coming before it:       Aptellruanga natmun ayaucirkamnek unuaqu. ‘He asked me where I
           would go tomorrow (ayaucirkamnek is preferred to ayagciqucimnek).","[378, 379]"
"Localis as Indirect Modifier of Subject
    When the third person subject of a verb is to be further described, an
absolutive noun is used, as in makumiut kuvyalartut ‘the local people fish
with nets.’ However, if the subject is first or second person, then the noun is put
in the localis case. This use of the localis is localis as indirect modifier of subject.",[404]
"      The 3rd person relative can function in both roles of the relative case: as a
possessor as in anngaan           irniara ‘his brother’s child,’ and as the subject of a
transitive verb as in anngaan neraa his brother is eating it.’ However, the 4th
person relative can only function as a possessor as in assikaa anngami
irniara (above), and not as the subject of a transitive verb.” That is, one
cannot say *anngami assikaa hoping to mean ‘his own brother likes him’.
Rather, anngaan assikaa means his brother likes him’ with ambiguity whether
it is his own brother or someone else’s.",[168]
" Exercise 14-14
      Write an essay in Yup’ik, about 150 words in length, describing a fishcamp
 (imaginary if you wish). Place yourself in the center of the fishcamp and describe the
 various things that you can see (tent, cabin, steambath, fishrack, smokehouse, cache,
 boats, nets), and those in the vicinity which you cannot see (other fishcamps, tundra,
 ponds, woods), and where each thing is located. Try to use the constructions from
 this chapter such as those which form the Yup’ik equivalents of adjectives.
                                        CHAPTER FOURTEEN                                            265                                SUPPLEMENT         TO CHAPTER         14Vocabulary Notes and Alternate Vocabulary
#1 In addition to ekua- for ‘to be burning’, there is eke-. Note that this later base is a homonym
     of eke- ‘to get or put in.’
#2 The base emute- ‘to go to the clinic or hospital’, can also mean ‘to take an item for repair,’ for
     some speakers. It is not clear what the original meaning of the base was, and which of the
     meanings given here is an extension of the other.
#3 The base iqair- means literally ‘to remove dirt.’ Instead of this base some areas use a base
     ervig- ‘to wash clothes,’ and this base is no doubt related to ermig- ‘to wash one’s face,’ to
     erve- ‘to dissolve, fade, run (colors) and to erur- ‘to wash dishes or the like.’ Where ervig-
     is used, the word for ‘washing machine’ is ervigissuun instead of iqairissuun which goes
     with iqair-
#4 In addition to ivrar- for ‘to wade’ there is iver-, which perhaps indicates a shorter period of
     wading, perhaps just ‘to step in the water,’ or ‘to walk through the water.’ Some people say
     irvar- instead of ivrar- (which is the older form).
#5 The word kapkaanagq ‘trap’ is also pronounced kapkainaq. This word is from Russian, and
     refers to a Euro-American style ‘steel trap.’ An old fashioned native design ‘deadfall trap’ is
     a naneryag, and a ‘pit trap’ is a petmik.
#6 The verb kassuute- ‘to get married’, comes from kassug- ‘to go in circle’, so that kassuute-
     literally means ‘to go in a circle together, or with,’ and probably refers to the Russian
     Orthodox wedding practice of circling the church. Before the Russians came, Yup’iks
     probably used only the words uinge- ‘to acquire a husband,’ and nuliange- ‘to acquire a
     wife’ or nulirtur- ‘to get a wife,’ which are still used for ‘to get married.’
#7 Unlike the case of the Yup’ik name for the Yukon River, Kuigpak, literally ‘big river,’ the
     Yup’ik name, Kusquqvak, for the Kuskokwim defies certain analysis. The ku could be the
     same as that in kuik ‘river’, and kuve- ‘to spill,’ and could have to do with ‘flowing,’ the squq
     could be related to the Siberian Yupik postbase “-squq” meaning ‘small,’ and the vak could
     be like the variant of the Yup’ik postbase -rpak which appears as vak (as on tuntuvak
     ‘moose,’ from tuntu ‘caribou’). Thus Kusquqvak could mean literally ‘the big one with a
     small flow,’ but this analysis is highly speculative. The English word “Kuskokwim” comes
     from the relative case of Kusquqvak as in Kusquqviim painga ‘the mouth of the
     Kuskokwim,’ just as English “kashim” comes from the relative case qasgim of qasgiq.
#8 In addition to nalluyagute- for ‘to forget, there is also avaur- used in various areas along
     with nalluyagute-, and totally replacing that word in NS.
#9 The verb pegte- ‘to release’ can also mean ‘to give up (a habit or practice),’ or ‘to break up (with
     one’s boy/girl-friend).’
#10 Sass’aq/cass’aq ‘clock, watch, hour’ is from Russian.
#11 Snuukuug ‘snow machine’ is from English “snow-go.”
#12 The verbs sugkite-/cugkite- ‘to be short in stature,’ and sugtu-/cugtu- ‘to be tall,’ though
     showing an s vs. ¢ variation typical of words from Russian (such as sass’aq/cass’aq above)
     are not from Russian. Rather the sug-/cug- element probably corresponds to yuk ‘person,’
     though we cannot explain why it appears as s or c here.
#13 Instead of tegganeq for ‘elder,’ there is teggneq in some places. Both of these words seem
     to come from tegge- ‘to be tough, hard.’
#14 The word tiiviigq ‘television, and the verb form tiiviir- ‘to watch television’ are (obviously) from
     English; in fact some Yup’iks aspirate the t, making it like an English “t.” On the other hand
     ‘radio’ is often called by the Yup’ik neologism niicugnissuun, literally ‘device for hearing.’
     There are two causes for the different treatment of ‘radio’ and ‘television.’ One cause is that
     with the increasing pervasiveness of the English language in Yup’ik areas (in part precisely
     because of these two devices), itis more the style now to borrow English words for new things
     rather than to create descriptive Yup’ik words for them as formerly. The second cause is that
     the English word “TV” lends itself to be taken into Yup’ik so much more easily than the
     English word “radio” the first sound of which, the “r,” is something not present in Yupik. In
     earlier times such an initial “r” on a Russian word would become lor al in Yup’ik as in alulaq
     ‘tiller’ from Russian “rulya” (and some people do in fact say liitiug for “radio”).

    In Chapter 13 we discussed how English ‘after’ is expressed in Yupik
through the postbase -rraar- with the subordinative mood, and therefore is
subject to the basic limitation on the subordinative, that its subject be the same
as that of the main verb (though there is a way to get around this as we shall see).
In contrast to this, ‘before’ is expressed in Yup’ik through a dependent mood
which does not have the same basic limitation as the subordinative, and which
has endings for a wide variety of situations (the precise person and number
indicators for subject and object will be discussed shortly). For example:      Angun aqumellruugq arnaq neqliurpailgan. ‘The man sat down before
         the woman served food.’
      Angun aqumellruuq neqliurpailegmi. ‘The man sat down before he
         (himself) served food.’
      Angun aqumellruuq neqliurpailegma. ‘The man sat down before I
         served food.’
      Angun aqumellruug arnam neqliurpailgaku nasaurluq. ‘The man sat
         down before the woman served the girl.’
      Angun aqumellruug nasaurluq neqliurpailegmiu. ‘The man sat down
         before he (himself) served the girl.’Precessive Mood and other Connective Moods
    The dependent verb mood expressing the connection between two events
that is expressed by the word ‘before’ in English, in the above sentences is the
precessive mood . The endings of this mood consist of two parts: a mood marker,
@~+(t)vaileg- (realized as paileg in the examples above), and following the
mood marker, a subject-and-object marker. There are a considerable number of
subject-and-object markers since it is possible to indicate with these markers
that the subject or the object of the dependent verb (in the precessive mood) is or is
not the same as the subject of the main verb. These subject-and-object markers
are   shown   on several    charts   further below,   and these    subject-and-object
markers (with a few alterations) serve also for six other dependent verb
moods which differ from the precessive mood in that they have different
mood markers. These six other moods, which will be covered later, express the
connections between events that in English are expressed by the subordinating
conjunctions, ‘because,’ ‘whenever,’ ‘although,’ ‘ifor when’ (future),‘when’ (past),
and ‘while.’ Collectively they may be called the connective moods.
    The subject markers for the intransitive of the precessive mood (and other
connective moods) are almost exactly the same as the possessed relative case
ending for nouns.
1. In other works on Eskimo grammar the connective moods are called the “relative” mood(s).

the subordinative, there are 3rd person as well as 4th person endings here,
whereas for the intransitive subordinative there are only 4th person endings.
    Examples of the intransitive precessive:    Nerellruug ermigpailegma. ‘She ate before I washed my face.’ (Compare
        nut’ma ‘of my gun’ — the relative case noun ending drops consonants
        while the verb endings keeps the g.)
    Nerellruug ermigpailemta. ‘She ate before we washed our faces.’ (Com-
       pare nutemta ‘of our guns.’)
    Nerellruuq ermigpailegpeci. ‘She ate before youy) washed your faces.’
        (Compare nutegpeci ‘of your, gun.’)
    Nerellruug ermigpailgan. ‘She ate before she (another) washed her face.’
        (Compare nutgan ‘of her (another’s) gun.’)
    Nerellruugq ermigpailegmi. ‘She ate before she (herself) washed her face.’
        (Compare nut’mi ‘of her (own) gun’ — the noun ending drops consonants
        while the verb ending keeps the g.)    The marker for the precessive mood is @~+(t)vaileg- with (t) used only after
base-final consonants, and tv from this source, or from a base that ends in te,1. The p variant of these endings is used with consonant final connective mood markers such as
~+(t)vaileg- for the precessive, while the v variant is used with vowel final verb markers such
as the marker of the consequential discussed below.

"      The fact that the third person subject person/number markers are exactly the same as the
possessed absolutive noun endings (see Chapters 5 and 6) coupled with the fact that both mood
markers (transitive indicative and transitive participial) are identical with certain nominalizing
postbases suggests that historically a transitive sentence, at least one with a third person
subject, can be viewed as an identity of two noun phrases. Thus arnam neraa akutaq ‘the
woman is eating the Eskimo ice cream,’ can be viewed as arnam neraa = akutaq that is, ‘the
woman’s eaten thing is the Eskimoice cream,’ and similarly for arnam nerkii akutaq. This may
shed light on the historical origins of ergativity in Yup’ik and in Eskimo languages in general
while explaining why the relative case has the two roles it has (possessor and subject of transitive
verb). This should be regarded as only an insight on the ancient history of the language. There
remain many     unexplained developments      subsequent to the historical phase in question (for
example, the fact that fourth person forms always point back to the subject whether it is the
absolutive subject of an intransitive verb, or the relative subject of a transitive verb).

     The optative mood was first discussed in Chapter 12. Second person subject
 optatives such as neri ‘eat,’ teguu ‘take it, or ikayurnga ‘help me,’ form
 commands or requests, while first person non-singular subject optatives such as
 nerelta ‘let’s eat,’ or ayagluk ‘let’sz leave,’ form suggestions. However not all
 optatives were presented in Chapter 12. The remaining optative endings will be
 presented in this chapter.
     The first person singular intransitive optative ending is @~+lii. It is some-
 what awkward to translate this endings (as well as some of the others) into
 English. Since the first person plural intransitive optative nerelta translates as
 ‘let’s eat,’ and the first person dual intransitive optative nerluk translates as
‘let’s eat,’ it would seem logical to translate nerlii as ‘let me eat.’ The trouble is
that the English phrase “let me eat” usually means “you), allow me to eat,’ and
this in turn corresponds to nerevkarnga, the 2nd person to 1st person transi-
tive optative with the postbase .vkar- ‘to let one V.’ There really is no exact
English equivalent to nerlii. One may think of it as the speaker presenting the
idea that he will eat, not really expecting an objection, but giving that possibility.
Instead of, or in addition to, translating nerlii as ‘let me eat,’ one can translate
it as ‘I should eat,’ or ‘may I eat.”!","[408, 409, 410]"
"First and Second Person Possessor Relative Case
    In addition to the unpossessed relative endings %:(e)m, %:(e)t, %:(e)k used
for the possessor of a possessed noun or the subject of a transitive verb, there are
also possessed relative endings. These are needed, for example, to combine the1. Verb bases that can be used like this may be considered a fifth category along with intransitive-
only, transitive-only, agentive, and patientive. In the Yup’ik Eskimo Dictionary they are called
elemental verb bases.

passessed relative ending, -ma, is used to express, for example, ‘my dog’s tail...’

‘cir’, (vour’) are -ma ‘my thing or things’, -mta ‘our thing or things’, -vet
hing or things’, and -vei ‘your, thing or things’ (but see variants below).
                                                                                 these
      See Note A in the supplement to this chapter for the historical origin of
endings.","[150, 151]"
"Inflection of Demonstrative Pronouns
     Just as the English words ‘this’ and ‘that’ have special irregular plurals
‘these’ and ‘those’, so in Yup’ik the plurals of the demonstratives are not formed
by merely attaching the ending %:(e)t as with ordinary nouns, nor, for example,
is the ablative-modalis formed by merely attaching ~%mek.
     Instead, the plural (and dual) are formed from what may be called the non-
singular intermediate base of the demonstrative. This is formed by adding +ku-
to the result of removing na from the absolutive singular form of the demonstra-
tive as presented on the chart above, which may be called the fundamental base.
                                    CHAPTER SIX                                       79
The pluralizing t (and dualizing k and all other non-singular case endings, such
as the plural ablative-modalis nek) are added to this non-singular intermediate
base. For example, the fundamental bases of una, ingna and augna are u-, ing-
and aug-, the non-singular intermediate bases are uku-, ingku- and augku-,
and the absolutive plurals are ukut ‘these,’ ingkut ‘those over there,’ and
augkut ‘the ones going away or spread out over there.’
    To form the singular ablative-modalis and other non-absolutive case singu-
lar forms, one goes to the fundamental base again, and adds +’u- (just +u- if
gemination is not possible) to get the singular non-absolutive intermediate base,
and it is to this that the singular ablative-modalis and other non-absolutive case
endings are added. For example, from una, ingna and augna come singular
non-absolutive bases uu-, ing’u- and aug’u-, and singular ablative-modalis
forms uumek ‘of, from this,’ ing’umek ‘of, from that over there,’ and aug’umek
‘of, from that one going away or spread out over there.’ In the case of tauna, the
process for deriving the singular non-absolutive intermediate base gives *tauu-, and
this becomes simply tau-.","[88, 89]"
"    The interrogative word, ca ‘what’ (the nominal counterpart of the verb base
ca- discussed above), cakucigq ‘what kind’, and qavcin ‘how many’ (note the n
in place of the usual plural ending t) inflect in the same manner as ordinary
nouns. Due to the indefinite nature of a question it is common to use the
intransitive verb plus ablative-modalis indefinite object construction when
these question words function in the role of object, as in the examples below. Note
also that qavein is always plural, so that the abl.-mod. for it will always be nek,
never mek.",[185]

           The odlique cases, which is to say all the cases other than the absolutive and
      relative, have possessed forms. These forms are used to express things such ‘to
     her boat,’ ‘from their houses, ‘at our fishcamp.’ For a 3rd person possessor, these
     endings consist of a possessor component which is just like the 3rd person
     possessor possessed absolutive ending but with any final k changed to g, and
     then following that is an oblique case component. The terminalis, localis, and
     ablative-modalis mood components are nun, ni and nek respectively (like the
     unpossessed plural for these cases).","[106, 107]"
"Note B
     In many areas the combination of the postbase -rpak ‘bigN’ and :~(ng)u- ‘to be an N,’ that
is -rpau-, can mean ‘to have a big N,’ if this is a more appropriate meaning, given the context,
than ‘to be a big N.’ This is particularly true for body parts. Thus angun iirpauguq would be
understood as ‘the man has big eyes’ (and would be an alternative to angun iirpanggertuq),
rather than as ‘the man is a big eye’ which is its literal meaning.

previous chapters. One of these is the vialis, the ending of which is %kun in the
singular and %tgun in the plural, and which means ‘by way of, through, or via
N'(the vialis of route, or vialis of place through which), or ‘by means of N’ (the
vialis of instrument).'","[82, 83]"
" Terminalis Case
    The ablative-modalis case is used for an indefinite object, and also to indicate
 the place from which motion occurs. Another case, the terminalis case, indicates
 the place to which motion occurs.' The terminalis case is marked by ~%mun in
the singular and by ~%nun in the plural so it is like the ablative-modalis in
regard to suffixation processes.",[57]

1. This is so in the numerical terms of other languages as well. It is not just a coincidence that
English has a base ten numerical system and people have ten fingers (and ten toes).
418                      GRAMMAR   OF CENTRAL ALASKAN YUPIK    Yup’ik is a base twenty counting system. This means that a numeral higher
than twenty will be formulated in terms of the number of twenties that fit into
it plus a certain remainder (which will be less than twenty). To give some
examples:27 is yuinaq malrunlegen (or yuinaq malrunlegnek cipluku) (hat is 20 + 7)
33 is yuinag qula pingayun (or yuinag qula pingayunek cipluku) (20 + 10 + 3)
44 is yuinaak malruk cetaman (or yuinaak malruk cetamanek cipluku)
     (20x2 + 4)
54 is yuinaak malruk akimiarunrita’ar (or yuinaak malruk akimiarun-
    rita’arnek cipluku) (20x2 + 14)
68  is yuinaat pingayun pingayunlegen (or yuinaat pingayun
    pingayunlegnek cipluku)(20x3 + 8)
72is yuinaat pingayun qula malruk (07 yuinaat pingayun qulnek cipluku
    cali malrugnek cipluku) (20x3 + 10 +2)
101 is yuinaat talliman ataucigq (or yuinaat talliman ataucimek cipluku)
    (20x5 + 1)
145 is yuinaat malrunlegen talliman (or yuinaat malrunlegen tallimanek
    ciplukw) (20x7 + 5)     ‘Hundred’ does not play an especially important role in this system. The
reason that ‘hundred’ is important in English is that a hundred is ten tens and
English counting (and the Arabic numeral system) is base ten. Yup’ik counting,
on the other hand, is base twenty. There is a Yup’ik word for ‘thousand’, and that
is tiissitsaaq, borrowed from Russian.
    The entire Yup’ik numerical       system should    be regarded as part of the
vocabulary of this chapter.","[427, 428]"
"Note A
      In the NS dialect, y becomes (voiced) s in certain positions within a word. In particular, y
becomes s when it follows a consonant, (or is geminated and/or is followed by two vowels). Thus,
NS has caliyugtua for ‘I want to work,’ but nersugtua (rather than neryugtua) for ‘I want to
eat,’ and qavarsugtua (rather than qavaryugtua) for ‘I want to work.’

Yup’ik ‘Yup’ik Eskimo’ #19Noun Citation Forms vs. Base Forms
   One can easily go from the concrete citation form of a noun to the abstract
combining form or base, and vice versa.
    Nouns in their citation forms end only in the consonants k, q, and n, and in
the full vowels a, i, and u.
    If the citation form ends ink, then the base ends in g, and ifthe citation form
ends in q, then the base ends in r. For example, the bases for kuik ‘river’ and
nanvagq ‘lake’ are kuig- and nanvar- respectively.
    If the citation form ends in Vn, then the base ends in Vte. For example, the
base for angun ‘man’ is angute-.
     If the citation form ends in i or u, then the base is exactly the same as the
citation form. For example, the base for ui ‘husband’ is ui-.
     If the citation form ends in Cta, then the base ends in Cte. For example, the
base for qimugta ‘dog’ is qimugte-.
     If the citation form ends in a not preceded by t, then the base may end in
either aorine. One must know the base termination as well as the citation forms
of such words. In this book, if such a base ends in e, then the aon the citation form
will have a superscript e: neqa® ‘fish, indicating that the base is neqe-.
Otherwise, the citation form will lack the superscript: muna ‘land,’ indicating
that the base is nuna- (that is, that the base is the same as the citation form).

it is to these forms that postbases and endings are added.","[38, 39, 40, 41]"
"Contractions with the Obsolete Verb Base ete-
     Just as English has “you'll” as a contraction of “you will,” and “don’t” as a
contraction of “do not,” Yup’ik has a process of contraction. In the Yup’ik case,
however, the underlying uncontracted two-word form is not used in most areas.
Eskimo has a verb base ete-, meaning simply ‘to be,’ which is not used by itself
at the present time (in most Central Yup’ik areas). However, contractions of this
base and the localis case are very common. For example, to say ‘itis in the village’,
one can say nunami uitaugq (literally ‘it is situated in the village’), but one can
also say nunametugq which comes from an obsolete two-word phrase nunami
etuq. The two words have joined together in present-day Yup’ik. To say ‘it is up
above,’ one can say, of course, pikani uitauq or, from obsolete pikani etug one
can get pikanetugq, and, this undergoes one further change, which occurs only1. This base ete- ‘to be’ can be used by itselfin Nun and to some extent in HBC, and also itis found
in Christian prayers translated into Yup’ik 75 to 100 years ago such as the following (in the
modern orthography) from the Moravian Brethren hymnal, Yuarutet: Tuaten piqarraami
etellruuq, watua-llu etuq eterrlainararkauluni-llu akwanun ‘Thus He (God) was in the
beginning, is now, and always will be forever.’ This is good evidence that the base in question
could be used independently in Lower Kuskokwim Yup’ik until relatively recently.

in front of it retains its (rhythmic) length “pikantuq.” To write this requires
doubling the a (since a single a followed by two consonants nt would not have
rhythmic length), but then an apostrophe must be written between the two a’s
to show that there they don’t cause gemination (see also the discussion of the
apostrophe in apa’urlug ‘grandfather’ in the next chapter). Thus pikanetuq
turns into pika’antuq for most areas. Rhythmic length on the part of the word
coming after the deleted e is reassessed, so pikanetici-llu turns into pika’antuci-
Ilu ‘you,) are also up there’ (for most areas).","[94, 95]"

     Non-speakers who wish to become able to speak and understand the
language with some degree of facility will need many hours of oral practice
beyond the time that could ever be provided in a college classroom. However,
understanding the grammatical patterns of the language is very important for
a person from an English-speaking background who is trying to learn to speak
and understand Yup’ik as an adult, and who thus no longer has the opportunity
to learn Yup’ik in the natural and seemingly effortless way that children learn
their language from their parents and others.","[5, 6, 7]"
"Constructions which Differ in Form and Function
     The above example is indicative in form but optative in meaning. There are
also cases in which a verb is optative in form but indicative in meaning (as in the
story below), cases in which a verb is interrogative in form but indicative in
meaning (also in the story below), and of course many cases in which a verb is
subordinative in form and optative in meaning, or subordinative in form but
indicative in meaning (see Chapter 13).",[326]
"Note C
      There is a (relatively small) number of verb bases that end in te preceded by a stop ora nasal,
for example apte- ‘to ask,’ and maante- ‘to be here.’ The postbase @~+ngaite- can follow either
one of its two ways of treating te with these bases. Thus one can either say apesngaituq or
apngaituq for ‘she won't ask,’ and either maanelngaituq (1 because the te in maante- is a
special te), or maantigaituq for ‘she won’t be here.’
      The postbase @~+vik ‘place to V7, the postbase @~+mi- ‘to also V (used only in the “northern”
area), and by many other postbases and endings that begin with ng, follow the same pattern as
@~+ngaite- with respect to final te on verb bases.

    Transitive Indicative Verbs with Third Person Object and any Subject;
          Transitive vs. Intransitive and Related Case Assignments;
       Agentive us. Patientive Verbs and the “half-transitive” Postbase;
      Fourth Person Absolutive Objects;    Further Preview of the Optative
Transitive vs. Intransitive Verbs
    In Chapter    3 we   studied   how   the   ablative-modalis   case is used   for an
indefinite object as in arnaq ner’ugq neqmek ‘the woman is eating (a) fish.’ With
a very different construction one can make the object a definite thing as in the
English, ‘the woman is eating the fish.’ This type of construction is very useful
especially when the object is something that in English would be expressed with
a pronoun as in ‘the woman is eating it,’ ‘the woman is helping me,’ ‘the woman
likes you,’ ‘did you see him?’, ‘I will visit you.’ Such a Yup’ik construction is said
to be transitive while the constructions previously studied are said to be
intransitive even tf an (indefinite) object is expressed with the ablative-
modalis. In this chapter we shall study the set of transitive verb endings used
when the (definite) object is 3rd person whether that object is expressed with a
separate word, as in the Yup’ik equivalent of ‘the woman is eating the fish,’ or
indicated only in the verb ending, as in the Yup’ik equivalent of ‘the woman is
eating it.’
    The Yupik transitive indicative verb endings are very much like                 the
possessed absolutive noun endings presented in Chapters 5 and 7. Thus:    ner’aqa ‘I am eating it’ (compare angyaqa ‘my boat’)
    ner’anka ‘T am eating them’ (compare angyanka ‘my boats’)
    ner’agka ‘T am eating them2 (compare angyagka ‘my boats’)
    ner’an ‘you are eating it’ (compare angyan ‘your boat’)
    ner’aten ‘you are eating them’ (compare angyaten ‘your boats’)
    ner’aput ‘we are eating it or them’ (compare angyaput ‘our boat or boats’)
    ner’aci ‘youy) are eating it or them’ (compare angyaci your, boat or boats’)
    neraa ‘he is eating it’ (compare angyaa ‘his boat’)
    nerai ‘he is eating them’ (compare angyai ‘his boats’)
    neraat ‘they are eating it’ (compare angyaat ‘their boat’)
    neraak ‘they2 are eating it’ (compare angyaak ‘theire boat’)
    ner’ak ‘he is eating them2’ (compare angyak ‘his boats’)    These endings all consist of two parts, a transitive indicative marker,
+°(g)ar-, and a subject /object person and number marker which is exactly the
same as the possessed absolutive noun endings presented previously. The
transitive indicative marker attaches to verb bases in much the same way as the
intransitive indicative marker, +’(g/t)u- does. As with the intransitive endings,
the (g) is used only with bases that end in two vowels. So from the verb base kiu-
114                               GRAMMAR      OF CENTRAL ALASKAN YUPIK‘to answer, the transitive indicative marker +’(g)ar-, and the ‘he to them’ (that
is, 3rd person singular to 3rd person plural) person and number ending :(ng)i,
comes kiugai ‘he is answering them.’
     An apostrophe for gemination is used with short bases ending in e, hence
ner’aqa ‘Iam eating it,’ and this apostrophe is omitted if followed by two vowels,
hence neraa ‘he is eating it.’
    With transitive endings, t is not used with consonant-ending verb
bases. Thus, from pissur- ‘to hunt’ comes pissurtuq ‘he is hunting,’ but
pissuraa (without a t right after the base) for ‘he is hunting it.’
    Also, if the attachment of a transitive ending results in a cluster of three
vowels, then the middle vowel is dropped. For example, from the verb base
nerellru- ‘to have eaten,’ the transitive indicative marker +’(g)ar-, and the ‘he
to them’ person and number ending :(ng)i, comes *nerellruai hence nerellrui
‘he ate them.’”! But see Note A in the supplement to this chapter for more
information about the use of the postbase -llru- with transitive endings.

the meaning of the transitive is. Thus knowing that kenirtuq means ‘he is
1. One might well ask why nerellru-, +’(g)ar- and :(ng)i don’t yield nerellruari with velar-
dropping of r blocked by the two vowels preceding it thus eliminating the need to delete the vowel
a. Apparently velar-dropping occurs within the verb ending ending first so that *+(p)ari
becomes +’(g)ai, and this is the form that goes onto nerellru-.
                                   CHAPTER EIGHT                                    115
cooking’, any learner (at least any English speaker) could guess correctly that in
keniraa ‘he is cooking it’, the object, ‘it’, will be the food cooked. For some verbs
however, the meaning of the transitive isn’t exactly the same as with English.
Thus, since nutegtuq means ‘he is shooting’ one might think that in nutgaa ‘he
is shooting it’ the object could be either the animal (or target) or the gun as in
English. In fact, in Yup’ik it can only be the animal, and not the gun. For other
verbs the meaning with a transitive ending will not be so obvious given only the
meaning with an intransitive ending. For example, the intransitive qilugtuq
means ‘it is barking,’ but with a transitive ending the meaning becomes: ‘subject
is barking at object,’ so qilugaa means ‘it is barking at him/her/it.’ Also, the
intransitive ikamraliuq means ‘he is making a sled,’ but with a transitive
ending the meaning becomes: ‘subject is making a sled for object,’ soikamralia
means ‘he is making a sled for him/her.’Exercise 8-1
