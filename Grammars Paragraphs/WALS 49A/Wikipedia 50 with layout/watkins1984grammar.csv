warrant            a hyphenated                name.          In    other           words,              the        label        Kiowa-
Tanoan        reflects            an     obvious            cultural               division              rather            than           a
linguistic                one;    Kiowa          looks        very       much           like        a    Tanoan           language
and     it    is     difficult             te       point      to       any        constellation                     of        features
that     might            indicate         a     particularly                  long          period            of    separation
from     Tanoan            before         the       Tanoan         languages                 split           from        each            other.

home        in    Carnegie,               Oklahoma             and     maintained                 ties           with         her     family

difficult               months          and      she      taught        me      a great            deal            about            the Kio-

1918        he    was     a    part-time                 informant           for       Harrington,                   who         was       in
Oklahoma            for       the       summer           gathering           data          for         the        Vocabulary.

      Although             tribal            membership               is       in    the     thousands,               the        number
of speakers                of Kiowa               is     far below              that       figure.             Mr.        McKenzie
estimates,               biased        on        personal            records,             that     there        are        no     more
than        about         four        hundred            speakers;              that       number           diminishes                with
phonology,               morphology,             syntax,          texts.             There         is     no        denying
that      arbitrary             decisions             must       be     made     as        to    the      appropriate
category           for      some     phenomena,                 but     in     all,        the     organization                has
served        the        structure         of        Kiowa       Fairly         well.
     Te    is      through          the    data        that           the    analysis            can      be        judged     and
improved           upon.           I have        therefore              tried         to     include            as    many     ex-
amples        as     possible.             Moreover,                  these     examples            have            been     se~
lected        From         spontaneous               data       (e.g.,         texts,           letters)             whenever
possible.                Examples         have        been       given         interlinear                glossas            (see
Appendix            1:     Abbreviations               and       Symbols)             and       provided             with     an
English          translation,               often          by    Mr.        McKenzie,            that          ds    intended
to   capture              the   flavor       of       the       original          Kiowa.
       This     grammar           will,         I hope,          provide          a basis               for     further            in-
vestigation                of   topics          that        could           not be         fully        elaborsted.                 In

the     years,            Glottal       stop       was      treated             as       a phoneme              by    Trager
(1960),         as    problematic             and      not       entirely                predictable                 by   Wonder-

source     of        the    controversy              lay        in    the       doctrine              of    autonomous
phonemics.                Briefly,       while         glottal             stop          is    never        contrastive,
it     cannot        be    assigned          unambiguously                     to    any       one     phoneme.                It      is

       If we    posit     an underlying         ia     in    the    case        of    these            automatic
alternations,             the variants        can be derived               by    a simple               set   of
sistently            recorded            as     /i/.         He commented                 that     ""che second                 ele-

as ia or i(a).                    The        interesting               histerical            question         is whether
all occurrences                   of /i/ are in fact derived                                 From **#1a.                In the
case     of non~alternating                          forms,        e.g.,        bfn        ""be    large     du/pl',
ef:      ‘night’,            phf{l       'wipe',            f-    ‘son,       offspring’, it is impos-
sible        to say        at     this        stage. 8            Therefore,        **ia is posited as
the     underlying               vowel        only      where          there       are      synchronic            alterna-
tions.
      Thus,        despite         the predictability                         of post-consonantal                       /y/ in
some     environments,                   /y/     will        be    written           throughout            the     grammar.
This     approach            is    faithful             to       the    phonetic            realization            and         re-

els     in    certain            environments                suggests              that     historically               vowel

       Hombert        (1978, 96) has                 suggested          the     following             physiological
explanation            for        this     phenomenon:
             After     a low        tone        (especially             a low        falling          tone)        the
             vertical         displacement                 of    the    larynx,          which        seems        to
             be     the main mechanism                     for     F,. lowering,              (Ohala,         this
             volume)         as    well        as    the    relaxation             of    the    cricothy-
             roid     muscle,            may    affect          the vibratory                conditions
             sufficiently                (Stevens          1975)       to lead          to irregular               vi-
             brations         of    the        cords,       which       will       be    perceived            as
             creakiness            (sometimes              called       laryngealization).
             This     is probably               what       happened          in Kiowa           (Sivertsen
             1956).        Another             possibility             is     that      the vibratory
             conditions            deteriorate              sufficiently                so    that     voicing
             stops.
The     cessation            of    voicing           apparently             also     plays       a    role     in        the
creation            of a glottal               increment,           discussed            more        fully     in 2.79,        ‘

and     'faucet')          are     derived        from verbs               to which         the        phonological

       Vowel     truncation            also     applies          across        a word         boundary          in        con-

by     the    presence           of underlying             glotral           step,     even       when    the

      Several         of     the    locative/directional                     suffixes           have    paired
allomorphs            with     initial          voiced     and       voiceless            stops       which        give
the     appearance            of    being       phonologically              conditioned.                Although
the     degree        of   regularity            strongly         suggests           a    phonological                 ex-

be    treated         as   tmorphological.                The    distribution               of       allomorphs
in     (113)     indicates              that    the     initial       stops        are     voiced       Followlig

      However,         there        are    exceptions           of    both       possible            types        to    a
rule     of     voleing        following          nasals.            A voiceless-initial                      suffix
may     occasionally               follow       a nasal        segment        and        a voiced~initial
suffix        may     follow        a    non-nasal        segment,          as      illustrated              in    (114).
Speakers         on    occasion           disagree        as    to    the     voicing           of    the     initial
stop     of     the    suffix.            The    cases     recorded           show        the    more       commonly

rington (1928, 11),                      but     it does         not      operate             under        the    same     con-
ditions         as     the        verb-root           ablaut.,          It    is,        in    face,        marginal           in

2.50.      Allepro                contraction.                All      types        of     speech          from       casual
conversation                 to    more        formal\ narratives                   are       characterized               by
contractions.                     These        reductions           and      fusions           of     independent
words     typically                involve        the     loss       of a laryngeal                    (/h/       or glot-
tal     stop)         and     the    deletion            of    the      first        of       two     contiguous

stances         where     phonotactic          restrictions              are violated,         e.g.,         the
occurrence          of /g/       before      /e/    and    the     absence     of     /y/   between           a
velar and         /a/.

    Occasionally, final short vowels are deleted, as in holdap
‘on the dress' from héldi-pi (dress-on/against).    Several loc-
ative words appear to be derived in the same way, e.g., gup
from either gu-p ‘out=away' or gu--pa ‘out-against'                                           (see 4.22
for     more     discussion).              Similarly,        pronominal        prefixes         can     lose
their      vowels       when     contracted         with     a preceding        word.         The      re-
sulting         forms     are    interesting         in    that     they     reveal     the     underly-
ing     identity         of   the    inicfal       stop    of     the prefix.          In     (135)     the
underlying          form of the prefix               is dik.         Pinal vowel deletion
and     syllable-final              devoicing       produce        the     surface     contraction
pdt, where          /t/ is all that remains of the prefix.   In (136) the
underlying          form of the prefix is iad; following metathesis to
di&     (see 3.234),       the rules apply as in (135).

by     virtue             of     shifting syllable                         boundaries.                   It should            probably
be     reconstructed                       in     morpheme-final                  position               only.         The     distri-
bution             of     /1/        in    the Tanoan           languages,                   if     it exists,              is also

Proto-Kiowa-Tanoan                              **d and        its       reflexes.
       5.          As     Hale (1967, 119)                    has     suggested,                   it appears           that wu hos
developed                 from        Proto-Kiowa~Tanoan                      labialized                  velars,           the     velar
having             lost        its        feature       of rounding.                    Harrington's                   (1928,           83)
one         example            of u        following           h was        apparently                   misheard;            the       word
is     /nddn/             'road,           route        (travel+path)',                      not        */hidn/.
       6.          Alternatively,                   given       underlying                   glottal            stop    preceding
root-initial                    vowels           (2.3),        the       syllable             boundary            in    these           ex-
amples             would        be        predicted           according            to        the        third     principle,
l.e.,         after            a vowel           preceding           a     single        consonanr.
       7.          The        modern        reflexes          of a reconstructed                           **#io are not

Kiowa-Tanoan               that     it is difficult                       to draw       on any        comparative

      10.      The    environment                    could        be    represented            formally          as
c(t).        but     C$        (syllable             boundary)           makes       explicit         what       is    sig-
nificant,           i.e.,         that        it     is a closed              syllable.
      11.      Actually,            several               of    these        nouns    are      partially           ana-
lyzed,        although            the     roots            cannot       be    identified            with     any      syn—
chronically           independent                    roots,
      12.      An    older         term            for     'dog',       rarely       used      now,        is c@--h}-
(dog-real)           and cQ-             is        ‘horse’        today.         This       is a common            and
familiar patcern: to--ht: ‘moccasin (té-dé ‘shoe')', to--ht-
""tepee  (to: ‘house, building')', c9--ht: ""awl (eg? ‘needle')'.
cégun recalls the time when the dog served as beast of burden
and carried               tepee poles                    (gum) lashed into a travois.
      13,      1 Gadekst                ‘rapids’             is the only example of a                            trisylla-
bic        compound        with         shortened               initial       syllable.             It is possible
that it reflects                   two         stages           of compounding,               the     first        being

continuous            spiral)            into            sheets        or strips        and    laid        out     on a

2.653},            which lowers the cone on the adverbs c Sp ""beyond'                                                               and

of     these        homophones                 in Kiowa          developed           out     of differant                     tones

 diphthong               was        already        partially          reduced,        e.g.,           ia.

       31.        In      the        Tanoan        languages,         voiced           and     nasal        stops       are        in

Where         the       Tanoan         languages           agsimilated             a voiced              stop     to    the

In     addition,               Kiowa        lost     the    nasalicy             feature           on    the    vowel         in
several           unexplained                cases;        compare             Kiowa    bg,         Tewa       my?     ""see,

   32.   /1/ also becomes /d/ (then /t/) inexplicably in the
perfective, e.g., gut 'write/pf', where no stop follows.    One
could         arbitrarily               posit       a final          stop which              was        deleted,        but
given         the present               data       there      ia no justification                          for such          a
segment.               The /1/v/d/              alternation               is a complex matter,                         the de-

however.             /z/        alternates                  with    /c/        in Kiowa,                   but     Kiowa        fef    is

Kiowa        /c/     does           seem        to    correspond               to     Tanoan               /c/     in    some      cases.

      50.             For example,               the numeral               'five'     has     initial p' in           the
Tanoan           languages            but        an     initial       vowel         (with     glottal     onset)         in
Kiowa:               Taos     p'anyou,           Tewa     p'any,           Jemez     p'{-t'o,       Kiowa     3nt'S

      51,             These        roots        with     initial           vowels     begin     automatically
with        a        glottal        onset,        which        is    synchronically             predictable.
The     historical                  status        of     [7]    in    Kiowa-Tanoan             remains       an    in-

cesses        are     treated        in     3.4.         Uninflected           particles,            including
‘adverbials,           modals,        and        numerals,           are    presented         in     Chapter
Four     according            to    their        syntactic           functions.
3.1.      Nouns.
3.10.         Introduction.                 Nouns       are       formally     distinguished                from
other     word        classes        in     Kiowa       by     two    criteria:        a)     their     inflec-
tion     for number            by suffix           and       b)     their    occurrence            in construe
tions     with       demonstratives.                    Noun      classification             will      be ex-
amined        with     reference            to    three        features:       a)     number        suffixes,
b)    pronominal         prefixes            associated              with    the verb,         and     c)    de-
monstratives            and        number-differentiated                     verbals.          The     section
will     conclude        with        independent              pronouns,        possessive            affixes,
and     nominal.      derivation.
3.11.         Stem     formation.                Noun     stems       are of        three    general         types
a)     free    roots,     b)        bound        roots,       and     c)    compounds         of varying           de
grees     of    synchronic            analyzability.

3.113.          Compounds.               Kiowa            is    rich    in       both         nominal        and     verbal

classification                   will    precede               a more        detailed        look    at        the        mor-
phology         of    the        individual                  classes.
      Every      noun       stem has               an        inherent        or    implicit        number        when            {¢

the    suffixation                of =g3           indicates            plural.           Nouns     in a second
class,     inanimates,                  are        inherently               dual/plural;          with         these
nouns =p indfcates singular.                                         An unsuffixed noun thus implies
its    inherent            or basic           number.                The suffixation              of —25 switches
the    number         of    the     noun       to        the     complementary              number        or     inverse,
The    complement            or     inverse              of basic            dual/plural,          is singular.
The    inverse         category              can        be    understood           as     superimposed               on     the
three-way            number        distinction                  of    singular,           dual,     and     plural,
However,        only        singular           and           plural         may   he    supercategorized                    as
inverse;        dual        is     always          basic.
dual/plural             can     be    disambiguated                    in    a    given       predication.
      Fout     major      classes             of      nouns      can        be    distinguished                 on     the    ba-
sis of the distribution of the inverse suffix -g5, as shown in
Table     7.       Further           subclassification                       is       based    on        the    pronominal
prefixes,          of which           the        dntransicive                third          person        prefixes

the    classes,          will        be     discussed             in       the    following              sections.”

the    allomorphs,           there     is     no    evidence        that     the        distribution           is
conditioned           by    class     membership. *
      Most of the variants                   of -g5 are conditioned                      phonologically,
the     rules    for       which     are     more    fully     discussed            in 2.7.        The    range
of forms can be reduced to the following set: -C5,-gu, =dy,
-6     , and    falling       tone.          A few    nouns       from      classes        T,    II,     and
III    are     listed       below     to     illustrate        the    allomorphs.

       Allomorphs -b3 and -d3 also occur unpredictably with sever~

-bs are interesting in that they ore dialect variants of the
more widely distributed allomorph -g5; some speakers regularly

falling         tone     marks       the    inverse      of most      nouns     ending         in -1l,

ically         these       basic      nouns            imply      both        singular         and dual,               they
are     most         likely       relics        of      an     earlier         dual     marking,               which        has

 use
 address       (vocative     (voc))},        and    c)    as   @a name     substitute         (name).
                           form   is    the    one       which    is     inflected     for     posses—
 The    referential
 ample,            a woman         addresses             her    grandson         (ref: moe gi           ‘female's
 grandson')               by      his     given      name,       but     grandmothers            are        addressed
 by     the        vocative         terms,        never         by name;     e.g., wee                 'MoMo/voc'
 (ref:            kf)           and tOh.19.               'FaMo/voc'        (ref:         cal).
        The        vocative         and     naming            forms    frequently         differ            substan-
 tially            from     the     referential                term.      Vocatives        are     often        distip-
 guished            by    falling          tone     or        the absence         of the    referential               suf-
 fix,        ¢.g.,        the grandmother                     terms above and pa:bf                (ref),        pa-bt-
 (voc)            ‘male's       brocher'.            More        often,     however,        the vocative                   is
 totally distinct from the referential,                                          e.g., t'@: (ref), segt-
 (voc)         ""MoBr*          and {- (ref), b61                  (voc)     'son'.
       The         vocative        forms      can        be    regarded      as     the    stem        on    which         the
naming form is based.                             Occasionally            they are identical,                    evg.,
yatma              (voc/name)           ‘sister-in-law’.                  When      the    two    differ,            the
naming             form   fs usually              derived         from    the vocative            by suffixing

dicates        an    agent,        which        includes         the     intransitive                   and    mixed:

    The    patient:object                     paradigm      is    most       regular             in     the    occur-

3.3.      Verbs.
           Introduction.                  Verbs        are        formally             distinguished               From
other     word     classes          in    Kiowa        by     three       criceria:             a)        their     in-
flection        for     aspect,          mood,        and     tense,         b)        their     cooccurrence
      The     obligatory                elements           are     the       stem,     a    pronominal             prefix
(see     3.2),        and     an        inflectional              or modal            suffix.             Preceding          the
stem     but     following               the     pronominal                 prefix     are       optional          incor-
porated        adverbs,            nouns,           and     verbs           (see     4.2    on    incorporation).
Syntactic           affixes             in    final        position            indicate          clausal          relation-
ships,        among         them        relative           clause           suffixes,         subordinating                 con-
junctions,            and     the        paired        sets        of       switch-reference                   markers
(see     4,3).
      Verbs      in    Kiowa            fall     into       two        major        semantic       classes,            tran-
sitives        and     intransitives.                       Transitive               verbs       describe          events
that        involve      a    controlling                  agent        and        cooccur       with      che     agent:
object        and     mixed:object                  prefixes.                 Intransitives               do     not   permit
prefixes         with        an     explicit              agent.            The     function       of      these       class~
es     and     their        correlation               with        the       four     prefix       paradigms            is
discussed            in 3.26.                This     section            will       be concerned               with    verb
derivation            and     inflection,                  both        of    which         reflect        the     transi-
tive/intransitive                       distinction.
3.31.          Stem     formation.                   Stems        to     which       inflectional                morphemes
are     affixed         are        of        several       types.             In    addition         to        roots   and
derived         simple        stems,            this       section            describes          incorporated,
number-differentiated,                              thematic,            and       imperfective                stems   and
concludes            with         the        derivational               auxiliaries.
3.311.          Roots.             Many        verb       roots         constitute           stema        to     which
will     show     the    long     vowel     only     in    open      syllables.                Because       the
vowels     of     consonant-final                stative     roots     never           occur       in   alter-
nating     environments,               it is      impossible         to say           1f   they     are     un-
derlying         long    vowels.          Active     roots     are         illustrated             in   (120)
and stative         roots        in    (121).

structed with           the     transitive        root,      e.g.,        khOl<~dd>-       'be pulled
off/jerked       out'        (<k4O1),     and     the other          constructed            with         the
detransitive          stem.       In    the    latter       case,      the    detransitive                stem
lacks detransitive -gya (<-gé-ia); instead -dd immediately
follows the root, e.g., kUul-da-d>+.   Semantically the transi-
tive    stative        indicates        the    result       of   a   single        event      whereas
the detransitive with -da indicates a state resulting from re-
peated    or    continuing         events.            Sentences        in    (130a)        and     (130b)

verbs        indicate               only      habitual          or    near        future        events,               never          an
event        in    progress.                  Instead,          the    perfective               refers           to       an     on~
going        event            as    well      as       to a    completed           one.         The        examples              in
 (148)       illustrate                   these        aspectual       differences                  with     ba           Fpo',
 {mperfective                  in     (a)     but        perfective          in    (b-c).

      Other          verbs        are     inherently                 punctual,                referring              to    the        point
of completion of the event. can ‘arrive’ refers specifically
to the end point of both g+ ‘come’ and ba: 'go', while kSn
‘convey/carry'                   refers         to        the end          point            of b3:          ‘bring/take'.
These      verbs        function            like          ordinary              non-motion                  verbs         with    re-
spect      to        the perfective/imperfective                                      distinction               in        that        im-

the remafning               morphologically                complex word             classes;              indefi-
nite/interrogatives                  and        adverbials.
3.41.      Indefinite/interrogatives.                                  Indefinite            and     interroga-

(ha‘-)     suffixes,            most       of     which        occur     fairly         freely        with    other
roots.         In    general,            the     interrogative             form        is     distinguished
from the indefinite by falling tone, for example, h9n-dé
‘what?’ but hon-dé ‘something’, but there are several forms
which are not distinguished,                              ¢.g.,        ha'-cd      'how?,           in some man-
ner’.
    hon- cooccurs with                         three suffixes,             -de     ‘basic’,           -g3 ‘in-
verse',        and        the   syntactic          suffix         -dé    ""because                (of)'.
rogative/indefinites                      are    complex,      but     the    roots      are not      all
identified,               e.g.;     the o in ha-o-te              ‘how many?,          several!       or
ha-d-p        ‘when         (exactly)',          nor     are vowel      length        alternatives           ex-
plained,             Words        listed    in     (204a)     are distinguished                by   falling
tone     on        the    interrogative            form;    words      in    (204b)      are    invariant.

               1l.         It is on        the     basis     of     the prefixes             that       Harrington            did
         not     distinguish              class     IIb     nouns        from    class       III       nouns.       One       can
         argue        for    separating            them,     however,           on    the    distribution               of    the
         inverse          suffix.          It is possible                that    class       III       evolved       out      of
         IIb    not       very     long     ago.          Kiowa     class       III    has    no       analog      in     the
         Tanoan        languages,           whereas         I,    II,    and     I¥    can    be       found,      if    some-

       22.         kom ‘friend’                is originally a kin term referring to men
married            to sisters.                 As a proper kin term, kom (ref) is ca-
(voc)         and ca-té             (name).           In its extended meaning                      ‘friend,          pal,
comrade’               ict has      no    vocative       or    naming    forms     but        is     treated          by
the possessive                   affixes as a kin term.

       24.         The     agent:object               paradign       always     permits        an        interpre-
tation            involving a 3pl patient,                      e.g.,    gyh-hd-gyd             ([lsg/agt:se/

Nevertheless,                  it    is    misleading          to    consider     this        3pl     patient              an
explicit               component          of    the    agent:object       prefixes;            it        is    not

agent,            or     indirectly,            as    is an implied       agent        (see        3.232).
       When        the     reference            is    to a 3pl       (human)     partent           but        no

occur        with    -y          and     which        do     not.          Only             roots           ending          in     y never
cooccur        with         perfective                -y.          In    fact,              there           is    some       disagree-
ment        among      Kiowa            speakers            whether            a       given          verb        has       -y     in        the
perfective             or        not.
       44.      Compare,                e.g.,        Tewa sywa                ‘drink’                 and Kiowa             thon
‘drink/pf'.

alternation,                see Watkins                    (1978a).                    While -p may be a reduced
suffix,         speakers                today        have      a        tendency                 to    attach           a   final            [p]

source for thig suffix, Taos t'ovto                                      ‘dance,         do’,       exhibits            the
glottalized-plain                     stop        ablaut        that    is     common        to    the        Tanoan
languages           but     is    virtually              unattested           in     Kiowa        (see        also     fn.

—t'o.
       49.     This        follows           the general           phonotactic            prohibition                  of e¢

maintained            adjacent            to the negative                with         lowering           of    the     fall-
ing      tone on          the    negative           (see        2.6521).            A possible            explanation
is     speaker        avoidance              of    the     potentially              homophonous               bing:
'rape/neg'.                Such       avoidance            of    terms        with     obscene           connotations
is     common       among         the     Kiowa.

       59.     The      ‘pointing’       gesture       in Kiowa        is     typically        made with
                                 protruding.           Pointing        with     a   finger      is    con-
the     lips     slightly
                rude,     especially        if   the    focus     of    the gesture            is a

particle         han,          Negative imperatives, however, are introduced
by the prohibitive                  particle poy, and the verb exhibits the fu-
ture     rather         than        the negative         suffix     (see    3.325).          The exis-

currence of the negative particle hén with particles                                              and ad-

4.161.         Tense/aspect              particles.            The    inflection      of     the    verb     in
Kiowa     reflects          a basic         distinction          of    perfective      ve.     imperfee-
tive     aspect;          in other        words,       it    is not      primarily     a remporal
contrast        (see       3.3).         The    tense/aspect           particles,      grouped        to-
gether     here       on    the     basis       of    their     semantic     function,         specify           a
time     reference          or aspectual              distinction         in addition         to    that
indicated         inflectionally                in    the verb.
       There    is    a    trio     of    tense       particles        indicating      immediate
time,     illustrated              in sentences             (26)-(28):      s3t 'immediate/re-
cent     past’,      yat     ‘immediate              present',        and mtn      'immediace/near
future’.         mf-       ‘almost’,           a fourth        tense particle         likely        related
morphologically              to min,           indicates        an unachieved         near     future
event     from a past              time     perspective          (29).      Note     that mtn and
yae occur with imperfective verbs, sSt and mf with perfective
verbs.

nate     and        subordinate              clauses     in Kiowa           are        three    pairs       of syn-
tactic        suffixes         (or clitics)              which      identify             a pair       of clauses
as    having         the     same    or       different        participants.                   Switch-refer-
ence     has        been     described          for a variety               of North           American        lan-
guages        and      is    usually          treated     as    a   question             of    subject        identi-
ty.      However,            we have seen              throughout           this grammar              that     the
category            ‘subject’        is not a particularly                         revealing          one     for
Kiowa.          Lf     we    examine          which     participants               a speaker          Judges        to
be     the    same      or    different,          a hierarchy               of     semantic          roles     emerg-
es    that      is identical                 ro that     proposed           by Fillmore              (1968)     for
subject         selection           in       English,     i.e.,        agent           > patient        > object.
Sameness,            then,     is    judged       according            to        the    highest       ranking
participant             in    the       clause;        if both      an agent             and    patient        are
present,            the agent is the basis                     for a same/different                         judgment.

      A     great    deal        remains            to     be    discovered          about         Kiowa      syntax
and       semantics.             This        chapter            has     been    an   introduction              to     the
main        features        of    simple        and            complex      sentences.                 The   reader       is
encouraged           to examine               the        texts         in Chapter          Five        for more      ex-

particularly                     from     the       perspective              of    relational              grammer,           ir     is
worth        noting              that    Kiowa            shows    no     evidence          of    a    passive            con-
struction.                   Kiowa       speakers            sometimes             give     English              translations
with        passives,              but        the    passive         translations                clearly           represent
an     attempt              to    capture           the     focus       on     a participant                 that       is    sig-

5.1.         Punning        story.         The      first       story        was      recorded         in October
1978     by       Parker        McKenzic,         whose     role        in     the       production       of       this
granmar           was    elaborated          in    Chapter            One.      Mr.        McKenzie      checked
both     the       transeription             and     my     tentacive           and         dnelegant     traensla-

grammatical              note     4).      He     also     corrected            a     few     omissions           of
hearsay           suffixes,         indicated         in     the       notes,         and     provided        a    re-
vised        translation            which        follows         the    story            (5.12).       Section
5.13     is a morpheme-by-morpheme                          analysis               and      section     5.14       gram-
matical           notes     for     the story.
       The story,           entitled Ydytghe-cbgya (play+word+story+tell-
nom)     'A       Punning        Story      for     Laughter’           by     Mr.       McKenzie,       is       an    ap-
propriate           sample         text     for     reasons           other        than      length.      The          Kio-
was     are.      fond    of     tolling         jokes     and        enjoy        the company          of others
with     a     good      sense      of    humor;         they     also       have         considerable            inter-
est     in     their       language         and     the ways           in which             it can     be used.
Puns     are       thus     a favorite             type of joke.
       The     humor       of     this    story      lies        in    two puns,             the     ""punch       lines”
of which revolve around two sets of homophones, obsy-, a bound
form meaning               a)     ‘really,         truly’        and    b)     ‘by         chance,     just       hap-
pened to"", and made                       (mi       ‘up, above’, -dé 'from/along')
            a particularly              nice   illustration                 of what     happens           when
 Speakers        mistakenly           assume   that           they    share    the     same        background
 information           (1-e.,    pragmatic          presuppositions).
     The    paragraph         organization              and     punctuation           are    Mr.    McKen-

 easier     to    follow;       the     numbers         in    Parentheses        are        also     intended
 to guide        the   reader     through         the        tranelation        and     tnoterlinear

       1.     Mrs.       Saumty     pronounces            the     vowel       of     these          suffixes         as    a
high         back    vowel        [u],     as     do    her    sister      and,          according            to    Mr.
McKenzie,            some     male        speakers        as    well.
    2. Contraction of the switch-reference markers g> ‘and/
same’ and nd ‘and/diff' with hag ‘now, then’ is normal in
connected            speech.
      3. The explanation for                           this unexpected               use of negs                  (<nd
hegs         ‘and/diff        then')            to join       clauses      whose          participants               are
identical            appears         to    lie     in    a momentary           shift           in    perspective
of     the        narrator.          in    telling        the     story,       she        is    one     of     the
grandchildren ('we’), but                          in using the possessed                           noun 4-m>+gyop
‘her-grandchildren’                       she     seems       to step      out       of       the    scene,         thus
the         'different’           conjunctive n>.                 The identity of first                            plural
and        third     inverse        agentive            prefixes        provides              a pivot        by     which
the narrator                can    resume         her place within                  the       scene:         ‘all    her
grandchildren                they/we           were     there’.
      4. This use of the verb t3: ‘act, behave’                                               as a substitute
for     verbs        of saying            in     informal       narratives               seems       to be         some-
thing         like       the use         in casual        English        of        ‘he    goes'        or     ‘he went’
for         ‘he    said’.
      5.      Speakers        vary        in     their    pronunciation                  of    the     final        syl-
lable as [te] or [de].                            Mr. McKenzie            reports             that     [te] was
used         in    his    family.
