Urdu is a major language of South Asia which has been gaining in popularity                                                                                   14 June 1999
since the advent of independence of India and Pakistan. It is one of the eighteen
national languages listed in the Constitution of India, as well as the national
language of Pakistan. Unlike Arabic and Persian, Urdu is an Indo-Aryan language
akin to Hindi. Both Urdu and Hindi share the same Indic base, and at the
phonological and grammatical level they are so close that they appear to be one
language, but at the lexical level they have borrowed so extensively from different
sources (Urdu from Arabic and Persian, and Hindi from Sanskrit) that in actual
practice and usage each has developed into an independent language. This
distinction is further marked at the orthographic level, where Hindi uses Devanagari
and Urdu uses the Arabo-Persian script indigenously modified to suit the
requirements of an Indo-Aryan speech. With this context in view, although the
grammars of these languages cover much common ground, nevertheless in order
to do justice to the differing sociolinguistic paradigms, separate materials have
to be developed for each of these languages, which taken together form the
fourth largest speech community in the modern world.
     The grammatical tradition of Urdu and Hindi is now almost three centuries
old, beginning with Ketelaar in the seventeenth century and continuing through
Schultze, Forbes, Fallon, Platts, Shakespear, Gilchrist and others down to the
nineteenth century. While Platts’ work has become a classic and is reprinted
time and again, the others have fallen into disuse. Lately, with inputs from
modern linguistics, and the fresh impetus given by Urdu’s new status as a
national language as well as a cultural vehicle of the Indo-Pakistani diaspora, the
need for new teaching materials is ever on the increase. The work of scholars
such as Barker, McGregor,    Russell, Shackle, Glassman, Pray, Naim and others
has met some of the present need, however most of them have developed language-
teaching books in which a discussion of the grammar is included as part of the
pedagogical requirement. As far as I know, no reference grammar of Urdu (or
Hindi) has so far been written, and it is precisely this gap which the present
volume attempts to fill.
    I have known Ruth Laila Schmidt for more than twenty years, since her
study of Dakhini Urdu appeared. She is widely travelled in India and Pakistan,
spending years in research and teaching. Her research in the Dardic language
Shina, and her Practical Dictionary of Modern Nepali, have in particular been
well received. She belongs to that brand of South Asian linguistic scholars who
deserve attention for their sense of dedication and thoroughness. It has been my
pleasure to interact with her on this grammar,    and I found the work fulfilling.
Though the volume is called a reference grammar, I am sure it can profitably be

    Dr. Elena Bashir and Professor Christopher Shackle read the entire manuscript
and offered criticisms and suggestions. I am grateful to them both, and solely
responsible for any errors or omissions which may remain.
    Numerous colleagues responded to my queries for information during the
three years it has taken to produce this grammar; there is not room to mention
them all by name, but they are remembered with gratitude. I also wish to thank
the tutors and programme evaluators of the University of California’s Berkeley
Urdu Language Program in Pakistan for patiently answering my many questions.
        The Department of East European and Oriental Studies of the University of
Oslo provided sabbatical leave as well as resources for the production of the
manuscript and funds for the visit of Professor Narang to the University of Oslo.

A verb is used in the subjunctive mood when it describes an action or state                 PLURAL
which is uncertain in some way, or which is contingent on something else.                      lst person                          ham létm                We may take. (m.f.)
Hence the subjunctive is often used in conditional sentences and subordinate
(dependent) clauses. Certain conjunctions, adverbs and phrases require the                     2nd person                          tum 16                  You may take. (m.f.)
