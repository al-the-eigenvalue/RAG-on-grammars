"AfuayeabodoomaaKofiAfuamadecornbreadgiveKofiforKofi'‘AfuamadecornbreadinmanyThe verb 'give' may even be the origin of the English preposition to, as
Robert Hetzron (personal communication) has noted.
The Indo-European
verb for 'give' is everywhere derived from *dd-, but not in Germanic.
If, however, this morpheme had come down to us in English, it would have
the form to [tu].
Could it be that this preposition entered Germanic as
a serialized verb marking the dative?
Give in Germanic is cognate with
words meaning ‘grasp’ or 'hold' in other Indo-European languages,
and

345 for the oblique cases, perhaps a comment on the ablative is in
order.
The Nez Perce ablative -kin'ix is, no doubt, cognate with the
Sahaptin ablative -kni/-chni.
This points to a proto-form -*ken'ix,
vowel harmony accounting for the palatalized and non~palatalized
allomorphs in Sahaptin.
The suffix -kan/-chan is an allative case
marker in Sahaptin, and is evidently also the first component of the
ablative -*ken'ix.

There are thus really two issues at stake here:
one involves the metalanguage with which we describe the facts of
structure, and the other involves where we go with our explanations of
that structure.
In this dissertation I try not to ignore linguistic
structure, but rather to present the facts in such a way that the reader
may fit them into the metalanguage of his or her choice.

"7Relational Grammar recognizes an abstract level of structure of
complete syntactic autonomy (see Perlmutter [1953-84])}.
In this
abstract level of structure there are syntactic relations that represent
neither semantic role nor discourse function, although, the 1, 2, and 3
relations look suspiciously like agent, patient,
and dative goal.
And,
it is worth noting here,
the universality of the abstract,
syntactic ""3""
is not supported by the Nez Perce evidence.
A dative case is totally
lacking in Nez Perce.
Patient and dative direct objects have exactly
the same syntactic description:
