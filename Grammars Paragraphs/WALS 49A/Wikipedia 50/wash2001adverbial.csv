is no case marking on nouns. Grammatical relations show a nominativeaccusative pattern. There are no canonical adpositions or adjectives. There is
significant prefixing on both verbs and nouns. Suffixation does occur, but not
to the same extent. The basic morphological structure of the verb and noun
is covered in 2.2.1 and 2.2.2 respectively.
2.2.1The verb
.
The Barbareho Chumash verb is polymorphemic. The core of the verb
is the verb stem, which is usually a combination of morphemes fused together
over time. (See section 2.2.1.6.) The stem usually has several prefixes and
suffixes. Figure 1 shows the overall configuration of the Barbarenho Chumash
verb. The affixes toward the top of each column are inflectional and occur
furthest out from the stem, while those closer to the bottom are more
derivational and often form part of the stem itself.

41OF SUFFIXES2.2.1.1Person and number
Pronominal affixes show a nominative-accusative pattern. As Ono
(1996) has argued, these affixes are truly referential pronouns. They should
not be thought of as agreement markers, which serve only to copy certain
features of independent NPs. An utterance can be complete with just the verb
and its affixes, because the pronominal affixes already indicate who or what
is being talked about.
The prefixes index the subject of the verb, distinguishing three persons
(first, second, and third person) and four numbers (singular, dual, plural, and
indefinite or unspecified). Table 5 lists the subject pronominal prefixes.

Pronominal suffixes index the object of the verb if the object is first
person, second person, or non-singular third person. The object suffixes do not
distinguish dual and plural. Singular third person objects are not indexed onthe verb.! Table 6 lists the object suffixes.

Emphatic glottalization is often encliticized onto the final syllable, and an
epenthetic /?/ begins the word if it is otherwise vowel initial. The imperative
form of kutiy takes a slightly different form when its meaning includes a
third singular object. In such cases it ends with /l/ instead of /y/.

semantic agents or patients, or appear in transitive or intransitive clauses. This
fact is illustrated below with the third person subject pronoun, s-. In (119),
the subject is a semantic agent, 'a dog', that eats eggs.

is indicated with the prefix sa2-. The past tense is formally marked with the
suffix ~waS. In Barbareho Chumash these tenses are relative (Mithun 1996,
1999). Thus the reference pointto a future time or a past time can be either
the moment of speech or a time under discussion, as in a narrative time line.
Below are some examples of future tense and past tense marking.

Finally, tense, aspect and modal morphology was rarely found in those
adverbial clauses that code semantically neutral relations, relations in which
conditionality and temporal meanings are conflated. These 'iffvhen' clauses
most often depicted generic situations that are a part of daily life or which
used to be a part of daily life in the earlier times of the Chumash people.
Such adverbial clauses did not serve to orient the main clause events to a
particular time frame, nor did they point to the internal make-up of the main
clause event. Also, they lacked the kinds of modal morphology and other
structural indicators of irreality commonly found in those clauses that code
conditional relations.
Pronominal subject marking
Different patterns emerged in the marking of pronominal subjects in
the adverbial clauses. In almost all cases where subject marking was affected,
it was affected in the postposed clauses. However, the loss of pronominal
subject marking in the postposed clauses happened for different reasons.
In all purposive clauses coded by the Gukanu 'so that, in order to'
clause type, the loss or retention of the subject pronoun was motivated by the
semantics of agency and control. When the main clause subject had full
control over the event or situation depicted in the adverbial clause, subject
marking in the adverbial clause was suppressed. On the other hand, when the
main clause subject did not have control over the event or situation depicted
348in the adverbial clause, or, when it was rather the adverbial clause subject that
had full control, then subject marking in the purpose clause was retained.
Purpose clauses could have the subject pronoun suppressed or retained
Alase af
urha
regardless
of whether
the purpose clause subject was a semantic patient. The
critical difference was the degree of control on the part of the main clause
subject. These generalizations turned out to be true whether the purpose
clause and its main clause had same subjects or different subjects, though
same-subject Gukanu clauses were rare. The semantics of control also seemed
to be the motivating factor behind the loss of the subject pronoun in the one
mehu‘because, since, from; in order to'clause type token that coded apurpose relation. Interestingly, however, there was rarely a loss of pronominal
subject marking in Gu ‘so that, in order to' adverbial clauses, 100% of which
are purposive and postposed. There were clear instances in which the main
clause subject was an agent that had full control of the event depicted in the
adverbial clause, but even so, the presence or absenceof control was notsomething that was coded in the morphosyntax of this adverbial clause type.
With rare exception, Gu'so that, in order to' clauses were found to havesubject marking whether they were same-subject or different-subject clauses.
In all but one of the few, exceptional cases, the lack of subject marking
involved the third person singular prefix s-. The lack of that subject prefix
was argued to be related to articulatory difficulties having to do with the close
proximity of sibilants.
In other adverbial clause types, namely the 2akimpi
when! simultaneous temporal clauses, the kKayké 'because''during, while;
reason clauses,and the kaheé 'like, as if' manner clauses, the loss of the subject pronoun
happened mainly in same-subject adverbial clauses. Such loss seems to be
motivated by the fact that postposed, same-subject adverbial clauses have a
tighter semantic bond with their main clauses than do preposed adverbial
clauses or postposed adverbial clauses with a different subject. In Barbareho
Chumash, however, such loss in subject marking applies only to third person
subjects (singular, plural, or indefinite). It never applies to adverbial clause
subjects in first or second person.
In only several cases was the adverbial clause nominalized. In such
cases, the third person subject pronoun was not retained. This was true
whether the nominalized clause was a same-subject or different-subject
adverbial clause. Such is the expected pattern of nominalized clauses
generally, as we saw in chapter 2.
In several of the adverbial clause types we saw examples of
discontinuous clauses, in which there is intervening material between the
349adverbial conjunction and the rest of its clause. This intervening material may
consist of an adverbial clause from a different clause type, or it may consist
of a left-dislocated noun. Subject marking is affected in these discontinuous
clauses,
WEArginthat
weeadverhial
OSSclauseWEABeretsubject| hPLnronoinekrNLSMeeethatWAEGEemightLAS. tetewnthenyice
wreiiwea¥¥dsoheAasuppressed are not suppressed in discontinuous clauses. This pattern was
especially clear with the Gukanu 'so that, in order to' clauses in chapter 12.
The discontinuous Gukanu clauses retained subject marking but the regular
(non-disrupted) Gukanu clause counterparts did not retain subject marking.
Finally, sometimes in the Kayké'because'and kaheé'like, as if!clause types, subject marking was lost in different-subject clauses. In most cases
where this pattern occurred the adverbial clause predicate had the stative
prefix 2al-. This prefix never co-occurs with the third person pronoun s-,
but it can and does occur with first and second person pronouns. This cooccurrence restriction on the third person pronoun s- and the stative prefix
2?al- remains an unexplained phenomenon in Chumashan linguistics. As
pointed out in chapter 2, it is also not always clear why a given predicate
would take the stative prefix instead of the third person pronoun on one
occasion, and then (on another occasion) take the third person pronoun
instead of the stative prefix. Transitivity of the predicate is not in all cases a
factor, since the stative prefix 2al- can and does appear in finite verbs with
transitivizing morphology, such as applicative suffixes. Further research into
the area of third person reference in Barbareno Chumash discourse should
shed light on the patterns of subject marking we have seen in the adverbial
clause constructions.
Ways in which point of view ts coded
Four adverbial clause conjunctions were found to have a significant role
in coding the narrator’s or speaker’s stance, point of view, or expectations
about when and whether a given event had occurred, could occur, or wouldoccur. Generally, when the haku ‘if' conjunction is used, the event or
situation named in the adverbial clause is believed to be very unlikely but not
altogether impossible. When the na 'if; when' conjunction is used, the event
or situation is believed to be possible indeed, but it is not necessarily expected
to occur. When the mali 'when' conjunction is used, the connotation is that
the event or situation is not only likely to occur, but it may also be expected
to occur. The conjunction wa ‘if; when' seems to be used when the speaker
does not wish to frame a given event or situation from his or her own
perspective, expectations, or experience. One reason for the speaker’s
reluctance could be that he or she does not have enough first-hand evidence
350or personal experience to make claims concerning the matter under discussion.
The conjunction wa also appears to be used when the speaker wishes to
refrain from making any assumptions about what another person or entity can
¥
+
dc or will do,
do. In
other
words, the speaker is not asserting his or her own
personal stance when he or she uses a wa adverbial clause.
The usage of the wa ‘if; when' conjunction is similar to the usage of
the na ‘if; when' conjunction in certain respects. The na conjunction can be
used to express a neutral stance, or a neutral expectation, about what anotherperson or entity will do or is able to do. However, whereas the na conjunction
implies that the speaker is speaking from his or her own perspective (however
neutral), the use of the wa conjunction seems to imply that, whatever the
speaker is saying, it is not something he or she is framing from his or her own
perspective.
At least three of the four adverbial clause conjunctions mentioned
above (wa‘if; when', na‘if; when'and haku'if') can be combined withother adverbial clause conjunctions to convey even more subtle distinctions in
the speaker’s stance or perspective. We saw, for example, that the conjunction
wa can be combined with the adverbial clause conjunction 2akay hu ‘until’.
The result is still an adverbial clause that codes a terminal temporal boundary,
but the conjunction wa adds an additional layer of meaning. It says that the
speaker’s own perspective is not adequate for determining when the terminal,
temporal event has happened, or whether it even can happen; rather, the
perspective necessary is that of someone else, specifically that of the referent
that is coded as the subject of the adverbial clause. Also, the concessive
conjunction 2iyeme ‘though; even if' may combine with either haku 'if'
or na‘if; when’to form different kinds of concessive conditional relations.","[370, 371, 372, 373]"
"As for other Chumash languages, there is an article ka- in Roseho (Island
Chumash branch) and in Purisimeho (Central Chumash branch) (Beeler and
Klar, n.d., pp. 40-41). Reflexes of the proto-demonstrative *ka also occur in
Ineseho, with functions that appear to be similar to those seen in Barbareno.
9. Normally the word momoy 'datura' is written with glottalization: momoy.
Harrington did not write it in this case.
10. The Obispeho Chumash cognate of the Barbareno morpheme hi also
has the form hi-, and means 'this' (Klar 1977:45). Obispeno is the sole
member of the Northern Chumash branch of Chumashan languages. Cf. note
8 above for information on reflexes of the proto-Chumash demonstrative *ka.
11. The topic marker 2ialso occurs in Cruzeho Chumash. See Beeler andKlar, n.d.",[136]
"Their main function is that of qualifying the meaning of the main clause
proposition. These two factors alone, i.e. i) that the adverbial clause does not
have a global role in structuring the discourse and ii) that the adverbial clause
serves mainly in the localized role of qualifying the meaning of the main
clause, are often enough motivation for the adverbial clause to assume a
postposed position. In this sense, the postposed position is the default position
for adverbial clauses. (Since topics and themes come first rather than last, in
the order of topic-comment and theme-rheme, the adverbial clause that is not
serving in a topic-like or theme-like capacity, ie. as a point of orientation,
would most likely be postposed.) There are, however, other factors that
increase the probability of an adverbial clause appearing postposed instead of
preposed: i) referent tracking; ii) an embedded main clause; iii) a main clause
that already has preposed material, such as a topicalized NP or a preposed
adverbial clause; iv) the adverbial clause has the additional function of an
afterthought or reminder; v) the adverbial clause is part of a routinized
construction in which the adverbial clause is always in final position; and
finally, specific to temporal clauses, vi) the adverbial clause codes a terminal
temporal boundary.
For some of these factors, to understand why they increase the
likelihood that an adverbial clause will be postposed it is helpful to look to the
theory of information flow (Chafe 1976, 1987, 1992, 1994), the principle of
least effort (Zipf 1935) and iconic motivation in language (Haiman 1983), all
of which are interrelated. Considering first the factor of referent tracking, we
saw that an adverbial clause tends to be final if it is tracking a referent that
was introduced (or re-introduced) into the discourse context as a full NP in
the associated main clause. The full NP has New information status in the
main clause, as it is being activated or re-activated in the listener’s
consciousness. In the postposed adverbial clause, the NP acquires Given
status, as it is then already activated in the listener’s consciousness, and thereferent is indexed as a pronominal affix instead of as a full NP. A reversal of
the clausal order would in many cases lead to ambiguity in meaning, as it
would not in all cases be clear who or what was being referred to, by the
pronominal affix, if the adverbial clause were preposed.
Other factors underscore the importance of conceptual relevance and
(hence) iconic motivation in the ordering of clauses. A clause is more likely553to be contiguous to the clause whose meaning it qualifies or completes. Thus
in all cases where the main clause was embedded, the adverbial clause wasnever preposed. If the main clause in question was a complement clause, the
adverbial ciause did not come between it and its matrix verb. If the main
clause in question was a relative clause, the adverbial clause did not come
between it and its head NP in the matrix clause. In the former case, it wouldbe infelicitous for the adverbial clause to intervene between the matrix verb
and complement clause, because the complement clause completes the
meaning imparted by the matrix verb, while the adverbial clause adds further
information about the complement clause. In the latter case, it would be
infelicitous for the adverbial clause to intervene between the head NP and
relative clause, because the relative clause provides information that is directly
relevant to the head NP, while the adverbial clause provides information that
is directly relevant to the relative clause. The clausal orders are iconically
motivated in that the clauses most conceptually relevant to each other are
always positioned next to each other. Such iconically motivated clausal orders
should require the least cognitive effort in processing information about the
events and states named by the clauses in question.
Iconic motivation also has a crucial role in the factor specific to
temporal clauses: in the corpus, temporal clauses that code terminal
boundaries tend to be postposed rather than preposed. The motivation is
iconic in that terminal-boundary temporal clauses code events that happen last
in a given series of events. Hence, the clauses that code them tend to be last
in a given series of clauses. The only exceptions are those that also perform
as pivotal points of orientation, making reference to a prior event and also
providing a context in which a succeeding event occurs. In such cases there is
a competing motivation: terminal events are last in a given series of events
and hence should be coded by final clauses, but pivotal points of orientation
need to be coded first in a given a series of clauses, because they provide
crucial, contextualizing information for the following event(s) or situation(s).
In such cases, the latter motivation takes precedence. So the terminalboundary temporal clause, which would otherwise be postposed, has to be
preposed in those cases.
Adverbial clauses also tend to be final when the associated main clause
already has preposed, associated material, such as a topicalized NP or another
adverbial clause. This preposed, associated material is already doing the task
of setting a scene or otherwise breaking the discourse into thematicallycoherent chunks. It is not necessary (or perhaps even possible) for the
adverbial clause in question to assume that role, so it assumes the postposed
354position. Another possible reason that the adverbial clause is final, in such
cases, is that it might too much of a cognitive burden to have so much
pragmatically-marked material preposed to the main clause, especially in a
initio! language Uke Darhasohn Chumas
Finally, adverbial clauses that serve as reminders or afterthoughts are
always final. The order is again iconically motivated in that reminders and
afterthoughts are comments on events and situations that were mentioned in
the preceding context, and the clausal order reflects this by the fact that
reminders and afterthoughts are coded by final clauses.
Relative propensity toward having a global roleThe adverbial clauses in part IV differ in the degree to which they
perform global, discourse-organizing tasks. The percentage of preposed tokens
reflects their relative propensities toward having a global role. Purpose
clauses, with 9% being preposed, were the least likely to do anything other
than qualify the main clause. Conditional clauses, with 86% being preposed,
were the most likely to perform discourse-structuring tasks. Neutral clauses
were second, followed by temporal clauses. The distribution of the clausal
tokens by position is summarized in Table 63.","[575, 576, 577]"
"DP=ART=NM-PL-HAB<what they used to drink was strong.>-agmil-EP.?-drink59.0557In line b. above, there is glottalization prefixed to the plural affix ~iy-. Such
glottalization is the kind of nominalizing glottalization discussed in 2.2.2.5. In
nominalized verbs, a glottal stop is prefixed to an otherwise vowel-initial stem
(as noted by Beeler and Whistler 1980:93). What counts as a stem, in cases
such as this one, is that part of the word that follows the article. Since the
plural prefix -iy- is vowel initial, and since it directly follows the article,
glottalization is therefore prefixed onto the stem. A further illustration of this
pattern is seen when a nominalized verb has the indefinite prefix -am-. In
(267) there is a minimal pair of nominalized clauses based on the verb kutiy
‘to see’. One of the nominalized forms has the indefinite prefix -am-, along
with the additional glottal prefix. The other nominalized form does not contain
~am-, and since it is therefore not a vowel-initial stem it does not have theextra glottal prefix.

the article 1= in the nominalized verb. There is one type of context in which
this replacement does not occur, and the nominalized clause retains full
subject marking on its verb. If there is a modifier or some kind of particle
preceding the verb, then the article will be attached to that element instead
of the verb. The verb is then inflected for person the same as it would be in
an independent clause. For example, the verbs in (268) and (269) are both
preceded by the particle howo 'still, yet'. In (268) the third person subject
is singular; in (269) the third person subject is plural. In both instances the

clause predicate is nominalized. As seen in chapter 2, nominalized clauses with
third person subjects do not have a subject pronoun, except if a particle or
some other morpheme comes between the article 1= and the verb of the
nominalized clause.
Several illustrations of different-subject kayké clauses are given below.
In (15), the main clause has a first person plural subject that is coded with
k-iy- '1-PL-'; the kayké clause has a third person plural subject that is
coded with s-iy- '3-PL-'. In this excerpt, Yee mentions indoor tasks that
she and her family would do on rainy days, and explains why cleaning the
beans was one of those tasks.

"<Long ago, the locks and keys were big.> At the Presidio and at the Old Missionthey had the big locks and keys.’One cannot literally lock a door by simply saying ""I am going to use a key"".
Thus the initial purpose clause in line b. above does not express a literal
purpose. Rather, it functions as a link between the implicit expectation set up
in line a. and the propositions expressed in lines c. and d. In line a., we learn
that the Barbareho people used words borrowed from Spanish when talking
about locks, keys, and any activity associated with locks and keys. The
propositions in lines c. and d. give the solution, in the form of an example of
how the Barbareno people actually used Spanish when talking about locking
up. (The word yawe 'key' in line d. is a borrowing from Spanish.) As
Thompson notes, non-literal purpose clauses in English are never found in
postposed position. The same is true for Barbareno Chumash. The reason
again is that the non-literal purpose clause is functioning as a link between
implicit expectations or needs set up in the preceding discourse and the
‘solution that follows. Purpose clauses in final position do not perform this
role.
Initial purpose clauses that help establish a chain of sequential events
always have a global, discourse-organizing role. Not all initial purpose clauses
have this function, however. One function not noted in Thompson’s study, but
one which is relevant to Barbareno, is that an initial purpose clause may name
an option that contrasts with another option given in the preceding context.
Such contrasts can be local. The initial purpose clause in that case may have
a scope of only one main clause. For example, the initial purpose clause in
(9), line d., has a much more local than global role within the discourse, and411does not appear to serve as a link between a given set of expectations or
needs and a solution.a.","[433, 434]"
"556Part VConcluding Remarks557Chapter 24Concluding RemarksIn this dissertation I described and explained the various patterns one
finds in the grammar of adverbial clauses in Barbareno Chumash, from a
functionally-oriented perspective of language. I used thirteen, structurallydistinguishable adverbial clause types as a starting point. I gave a detailed
account of the kinds of semantic relations coded by these adverbial clause
types and the morphosyntactic patterns one finds associated with the semantic
relations within each clause type. I then compared the initial and final tokens
of these types with respect to similarities and differences in structure, extent
of scope, and punctuation/intonation boundaries. Finally, I focussed on the
similarities and differences in discourse functions between initial and final
clauses that code purposive, conditional, temporal and semantically neutral
relations.
It is interesting to consider the areas of adverbial clause grammar
where Barbareno Chumash differs from other languages, the areas of
adverbial clause grammar where it shows striking similarities with other
languages, and why it is that the differences and similarities appear where they
do. For example, Barbareno Chumash grammar codes the same kinds of
semantic relations one finds in other languages: temporal, conditional, neutral
(which many researchers treat as conditional), concessive, manner,
reason/causal, and purposive. Many languages code these semantic categories
in adverbial clauses, but the ways in which they code them can be quite
different. To illustrate this point, I will highlight some of the differences with
regard to temporal and conditional/neutral relations.
English has the conjunctions before and after, which denote respectively
a precedence (posteriority) relation, where the main clause event precedes the
adverbial clause event, and a subsequence (anteriority) relation, where the
main clause event occurs subsequent to the adverbial clause event. Barbareno
Chumash does not have temporal conjunctions that mean 'before' or
‘after’, but instead uses the general, non-temporally specific conjunction
mali 'when' in both cases, in combination with other morphosyntax that
further specifies the temporal relation. Thus in terms of the variety of
temporal conjunctions that can be used to code precedence and subsequence
temporal relations, English is more explicit than Barbareno Chumash.
558In coding conditional/neutral relations, languages differ in the extent to
which their adverbial conjunctions code degrees of hypotheticality and the
speaker’s expectation about the likelihood that an event can or will occur.
English codes the distinction with two conjunctions: if and when. The
conjunction if indicates a lower degree of probability and expectation, or
higher degree of hypotheticality, and the conjunction when indicates a higher
degree of probability and expectation, or lower degree of hypotheticality. On
the other hand, Barbareho Chumash has three adverbial conjunctions that
code distinctions of hypotheticality and expectation. Events that denote the
lowest probability of ever occurring (= highest degree of hypotheticality) are
coded with the conjunction haku ‘if'. Events that have the most probability
of occurring (= lowest degree of hypotheticality) are coded with the
conjunction mali 'when'. Events that fall in the middle of the scale of
probability, expectation and hypotheticality are coded with the conjunction na
‘if; when'.","[578, 579, 580, 581]"

is aspirated. The Gukanu clause subject refers to the people who are dying
as a result of the sorcerer’s magic. Since the main clause subject (the sorcerer)
controls what is happening to the adverbial clause subject (the people), there
should not be any subject pronoun indexed on the first verb mik 'to be
long'. The verb of course has the future tense prefix sa2-, but that is all that
it should have. Ideally, then, the first verb in line f. should have the form*samék, not the form samék that was written instead. The aspirated [s]
means that there is a third person subject pronoun present, in this case a nonreferential or ""dummy"" third person with the meaning 'it'. Yet this pronoun

"12.1.3 Subject marking in discontinuous Gukanu clauses
Though it rarely happens, sometimes another adverbial clause will
intervene between the Gukanu conjunction and the rest of the Gukanu
clause. The result is a discontinuous Gukanu clause. In these cases, the verbof the Gukanu-clause proper will have a subject pronoun, even if the main
clause subject has full control over the Gukanu clause subject. The Gukanu
clause in these cases still has the future tense prefix sa?-, just as it would
without the other intervening adverbial clause. One can get a better
understanding of how this occurs with the following minimal pair of adverbial
clause constructions. The two members of this contrasting pair come from
different narratives about the particular kind of wooden bowl called a stuk.",[293]

Florentino, the topicalized NP in line a., instead of Lucrecia, the object NP inline b. (It will be recalled that pronouns in Chumash languages do not
distinguish gender.) Thus if the order of the adverbial clause were changed,
the meaning would change to:

"An extensive taxonomy of adverbial clauses from a cross-linguistic
perspective is given in Thompson and Longacre 1985. Adverbial clause
constructions are defined as 'a set of two-clause constructions in which oneclause can be said to modify the other in a way similar to the way in which anadverb modifies a proposition' (p. 171). This article has two parts. Part I
discusses in detail the types of adverbial clauses found around the world.
These are labeled according to the kinds of semantic relationships that they
signal,
specifically:
circumstantial/means,time,
location,
manner,
purpose,
reason,
simultaneous, conditional, concessive, substitutive,additive, and absolutive. Thompson has since discarded the absolutive
category.’ With each semantic category of adverbial clause, Thompson and
Longacre describe and explain certain structural or morphosyntactic
regularities that one usually finds associated with them. Part I of the study also
highlights similarities between the types of adverbial clauses and other kinds
of syntactic structures, for example juxtaposed clauses, that can convey similar
meanings.
There is also some discussion of borrowed subordinators;
specifically, the factors that lead to one language borrowing an adverbial
clause conjunction from another language. Part II of the Thompson and
Longacre study examines adverbial clauses from a discourse perspective in
monologic texts. It focuses on the ways in which adverbial clauses are relevant
to the structure of paragraphs and of the discourse as a whole. The issues and
questions addressed in Thompson and Longacre 1985, regarding both specific
types of adverbial clauses as well as specific functions, are a useful heuristic
for anyone planning a case study on adverbial clauses.
Chafe 1984 explores how intonation contours and punctuation units
reflect the extent to which an adverbial clause is bound to its main clause, inEnglish written and conversational discourse. If both an adverbial clause and
its main clause occur in the same intonation or punctuation unit, the adverbial
clause is said to be 'bound'. Otherwise, it is said to be 'free'. This study7compares four types of adverbial clauses: preposed clauses that are free,
preposed clauses that are bound; postposed clauses that are free, and
postposed clauses that are bound. A major finding was that adverbial clauses
that are bound are almost always postposed. Chafe explains this tendency
through the theory of Information Flow. The intonation/punctuation unit is the
domain of information flow, with information flowing from the old or familiar
to the new or unfamiliar. When two clauses fall under a single contour, it is
likely that only one of the clauses will convey new or unfamiliar information.
Chafe found that the postposed adverbial clauses contained the new or
unfamiliar information. A second important finding is that free adverbial
clauses are much more common than bound adverbial clauses. Free adverbial
clauses tend to occur initially, however, because they function as 'guideposts'
to information flow, 'signaling a path or orientation in terms of which the
following information is to be understood ' (p. 444). This, according to Chafe,
is probably the prototypical function of adverbial clauses. For the free
adverbial clauses that occur postposed, Chafe found other explanations. Some
were afterthoughts. Other free, postposed adverbial clauses functioned to
modify only the latter part of the preceding main clause, rather than modifying
the entire main clause. This suggests, according to Chafe, that '...the modified
portion of the main clause [is] not even clearly articulated in the speaker’s
mind until the main clause was completed' (p. 447). The findings in Chafe’s
study are incorporated into the issues and questions I address in parts three
and four of this dissertation.
Ford 1993 is an entire monograph devoted to the discourse functions
of adverbial clauses in American English conversation, using the sociological
framework of conversation analysis. Focusing on prosody and interaction
within a conversational context, the author examines the distribution and
discourse functions of temporal, conditional, and causal (reason) adverbial
clauses. There are two main conclusions. The first is that preposed adverbial
clauses play a significant, global role in the structuring of a discourse. The
second is that postposed adverbial clauses have a local role of modifying the
proposition of the preceding main clause, without affecting the overall
organization of the discourse. These conclusions are echoed throughout all of
the literature on adverbial clauses reviewed here, including those studies using
monologic data. Ford’s other findings are that conditional clauses are most
often initial, while temporal and causal (reason) clauses are most often final.
The reasons for these distributions are discussed in terms of factors that are
specific to talk-in-interaction, e.g. the system of turn-taking, problems in
understanding and agreement between speaker and hearer, the need to soften
8assertions, personal motivations, listener prompts, etc. None of these factors
are directly applicable to the data in my Barbareno corpus. However,
throughout the book Ford makes specific predictions or generalizations about
the functions of initial and final temporal, conditional, and causal clauses.
These predictions provide another perspective that has proven useful to my
analyses of the Barbareno data in parts three and four of the dissertation.
Haiman 1978 is a crosslinguistic study of the connection between
conditional clauses and topics. The author finds that, very often among
unrelated languages, conditional clauses and topics resemble each other in
marking and in function. Haiman notes that this similarity is at first surprising,
since topics and conditional clauses are structures that one would not normallythink to be related. Haiman’s discussion follows the premise that similarity in
structure must reflect a similarity in meaning since '...grammars tend to miss
semantic generalizations, rather than to create spurious ones' (p. 565). He
compares traditional definitions of conditional clauses in the philosophical
literature with definitions of 'topic' found in linguistics literature, and finds
that the definitions are similar. Topics and conditional clauses are found to be
unchallengeable and thereby ‘constitute the framework which has been
selected for the following discourse’ (pp. 583,585). In other words, both are
pragmatically presupposed (Givén 1990:830). The main conclusions from this
study are that conditional clauses and topics belong to the same category, and
that conditional clauses are the topics, i.e. givens or presuppositions, of the
sentences in which they occur. As Givén (1990:846) notes, this comparison of
adverbial clauses and topics can only go so far. Prototypical nominal topics
tend to be highly recurrent and important, i.e. anaphoric and cataphoric,
whereas adverbial clauses are rarely recurrent. Still, Haiman’s observations are
relevant to Barbareho data in that many initial adverbial clauses precede the
topic marker 21. This is especially true of those adverbial clauses that express
a conditional relation. The foregoing is the extent of the insight that Haiman
1978 provides for the purposes of my study, however, since his data consist of
sentences constructed in isolation.
Ford and Thompson 1986 is a study of the discourse function of
conditionals in both spoken and written texts. One of the central aims of that
study is to test Haiman’s (1978) proposal that conditionals have the same
function as topics. The authors found that there are several functions that
conditional clauses may have in discourse contexts. Most of these are
associated with conditionals that occur in initial position. Like topics, initial
conditionals serve as a framework of shared information for the following
discourse. First, initial conditionals may be used to repeat claims voiced earlier
9in the discourse. A different, second function is that they may establish
contrasts with information given earlier in the discourse. Or, third, they can be
used to introduce particular cases exemplifying preceding generalizations.
Finally, initial conditionals may also function to offer other options or points
of view that are relevant to those of the preceding discourse. Final
conditionals, unlike initial conditionals, seem to be motivated by factors that
have little to do with the need for a shared frame of reference. For example,
the length of the conditional clause can affect whether it is initial or final;
lengthy ones tend to be final. If the conditional clause is embedded within
another clause then it tends to be postposed, and its scope is limited to the
embedded clause. Also, important or lengthy subjects in the consequent clause
tend to be initial rather than final, which means that the conditional clause hasto be final. Ford and Thompson also found that final conditionals tend to
follow main clauses that express an evaluation or question, though they cannot
explain why this should be so. Final conditional clauses do not play as
important a role in organizing the frame of a discourse as initial conditionals
do; they are not pivotal points in the development of a discourse. One notable
function of final conditionals, however, is that they often function to introduce
afterthoughts or serve as reminders. In conversational texts, conditionals are
used to make polite requests, or otherwise make a given point of view appear
less dogmatic or intrusive. The texts in my Barbareno database are not
conversational texts. Nonetheless, the Ford and Thompson study provides
many insights that have been incorporated into chapter 21 of this dissertation.
Thompson 1985 is a seminal study of the discourse properties of
purpose clauses in written English texts. The author focuses on the different
discourse functions of initial and final purpose clauses. Her main findings are
that initial and final purpose clauses have radically different roles with respect
to the organization of the discourse, even though both types of clauses have
a similar structure:
'...the initial purpose clause functions to state a ""problem"" within
the context of expectations raised by the preceding discourse, to which
the following material (often many clauses) provides a solution, while
the final purpose clause plays the much more local role of stating the
purpose for which the action named in the immediately precedingclause is performed' (p. 55).
Another major finding in Thompson’s study is that the number of initial
purpose clauses is much lower than the number of final purpose clauses.
10Thompson’s insights have been incorporated into my analysis of initial and
final purpose clauses in chapter 20.
Finally, two additional, important sources that inform my analysis are
Haiman and Thompson 1984 and Matthiessen and Thompson 1988. The
former study makes the point that the term ‘subordination' or ‘subordinate
clause' is too broad to be useful in characterizing an adverbial clause, a
complementclause, a relative clause, etc. The latter study, Matthiesen andThompson 1988, is done in a Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) framework.
My dissertation is not written in an RST framework. However, the
Matthiessen and Thompson study is valuable because one of its central aims
is to define and exemplify, explicitly, how adverbial clause combining is
different from other types of clause combining and subordination. For
example, the authors discuss the difference between 'embedding' and ‘clause
combining '. They argue that complement clauses and relative clauses, which
are types of clause embedding, are completely different in kind from adverbial
clauses, which illustrate clause combining. They further discuss the difference
between two types of clause combining: parataxis and hypotaxis. Roughly
speaking, parataxis involves the combining of clauses that are on the same
syntactic level, such as seen in prototypical coordination. Hypotaxis involves
the combining of clauses that are not on the same syntactic level, i.e., one
clause is syntactically dependent on one or more 'main' clauses. Hypotaxis
can be thought of as a more explicit kind of subordination. That is, though a
hypotactic clause is syntactically dependent on a main clause, it is not a clause
that is also a dependent constituent within that main clause, as a subject
complement, object complement, or a relative clause would be. More about
hypotaxis in relation to the definition of the term ‘adverbial clause' is given
in section 1.7.
1.7 TerminologyIn this section I define or characterize terms and concepts that are
especially relevant to my analysis of adverbial clauses in Barbareho Chumash.
I begin with the concept of ADVERBIAL CLAUsE. Following that I give definitions
for terms traditionally used to denote the semantic relation of an adverbial
clause to its main clause(s): TEMPORAL, CONDITIONAL, CONCESSIVE, REASON,
PURPOSIVE, and MANNER. Another kind of semantic relation distinguised in this
dissertation is the semantically NEUTRAL relation. These semantic relations are
defined in a general way in this section, but they will be further defined and
discussed in terms of criteria specific to the Barbareno language in section
1.9.2.
11My general characterization of a prototypical adverbial clause is as
follows. First, an adverbial clause exists in a hypotactically dependent
relationship with one or more clauses. A HyPOTACTIC CLAUSE is one that is
dependent on a main clause but which is not embedded in the main clause.
As noted in Matthiessen and Thompson 1988, hypotactic dependence is an
important feature that distinguishes adverbial clauses from other kinds of
subordinate clauses, such as object- or subject complements and restrictive
relative clauses, which are embedded in their main clause. Thus a complement
clause is either a subject or object argument of a main clause verb, but an
adverbial clause is never an argument. A restrictive relative clause is a
constituent that makes up part of a larger noun phrase, but an adverbial
clause never serves as a constituent of a noun phrase.
Second, unlike other kinds of hypotactically dependent clauses, such as
non-restrictive relative clauses and clauses of reported speech (the latter is not
to be confused with clauses of quoted speech), an adverbial clause can
normally appear before or after the main clause without a change in meaning.
Finally, as traditionally defined for two-clause constructions, an adverbial
clause is one that modifies another clause or sentence. As seen in the
literature review section, however, sentential modification does not begin todescribe the kinds of functions an adverbial clause may have.
A PREPOSED or initial adverbial clause is one that occurs before its main
clause. A postroseEp or final adverbial clause is one that follows its main clause.
Following now are general definitions and characterizations I use for
the traditional terms that denote the semantic relation between an adverbial
clause and its main clause. These definitions and characterizations are
extrapolated from discussions in Thompson and Longacre 1985, Matthiessen
and Thompson 1988, Givén 1990 and Ford 1993. A Tempora_ relation is one
in which the event named by the main clause is anchored to the time of the
event named by the adverbial clause. In a conpiTIonaL relation, the adverbial
clause provides the condition(s) under which the event named by the main
clause holds. Sometimes the semantic relation is conflated with respect to
conditionality and time. I refer to such relations and the adverbial clauses that
code them as NEUTRAL. In a concsssive relation, the adverbial clause expresses
a situation that, from the narrator’s or protagonist’s point of view, would
‘under normal circumstances detract from or mitigate the situation expressed
in the main clause. Or, as Thompson and Longacre (1985:198) state, it ""makes
a concession against which the proposition in the main clause is contrasted.""
In a purpose relation, the adverbial clause provides a purpose for which the
event in the main clause is undertaken. Importantly however, as noted in
12Thompson and Longacre 1985:185, the situation expressed in the adverbial
clause must be unrealized at the time of the event expressed in the main
clause. This restriction is a crucial difference between purpose and REASON
relations. In the latter, the situation in the adverbial clause is the reason forthe situation that obtains in the main clause, and it may already be realized
by the time the situation expressed by the main clause has occurred. Finally,
in a MANNER relation, the adverbial clause specifies the manner in which the
action or event of the main clause occurs.
The foregoing are non-language-specific definitions for the semantic
categories of adverbial clauses analyzed in this dissertation. In section 1.9.2 I
discuss the methodology I use to determine which Barbareho adverbial clauses
have which of the semantic relations discussed above.
1.8 DatabaseAlmost all of the data that I have used for this dissertation come from
microfilm reel #59 of the Harrington corpus, which is outlined in Mills and
Brickfield 1986. This reel consists mostly of 243 narrative texts from Mary
Yee. I have provided an interlinear, morpheme-by-morpheme gloss for all of
these texts, which vary in length from about half of a printed page to fifteen
printed pages including the free translation. Of the 243 texts in reel #59, 205
were found to contain adverbial clauses. Examples of narratives from reel #59
include procedural or ‘how to' texts, personal family experiences,
ethnographic accounts, and tales about legendary sorcerers and other
magically powerful people. It should be noted that there are several more
microfilm reels of data from Mary Yee, and that my data are taken from
roughly 25% of the total corpus of texts and notes that Harrington recorded
from Yee.
Of the data from Beeler’s corpus, I used one of the myth texts he
recorded from Mary Yee (Beeler and Whistler 1980). This published text is
four pages long, with detailed commentary given in footnotes. This text was
found to have adverbial clauses, bringing to a total of 206 the number of
narrative texts in my analyzed corpus in which I was able to find adverbial
clauses.
The total number of adverbial clauses in the corpus is 567. In the
summary to part two I summarize the distributions of these clauses with
regard to structural type, semantic relation, and position.","[29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35]"
"In general, however, non-adverbial Gukanu clauses are less sensitive
to the semantics of control, while adverbial Gukanu clauses are more sensitiveto it . It makes sense that this should be so. The adverbial Gukanu clause is
more syntactically dependent upon the main clause that precedes it. It is
therefore more structurally and semantically affected by that preceding clause

<who hasn’t visited since (a time) long ago.>These four illustrations of superstitions are actually exemplars of the
category ‘superstitions that pertain to things that fall on the kitchen floor’.
In that sense, one could argue that these conditional clauses are exploring
options within that category, in addition to performing the task of exemplifying
the generalization that the early Spanish were superstitious. In either case, the442conditional clauses develop the discourse by introducing particular cases of a
generalization given earlier in the narrative. That each of these particular
cases are related to one another is made evident through the shared lexical
items and clansal structure that these conditional clauses have:
(18)(Gu)=na=s-piliglaw(CONT) =if=3-fallNP'and/but if NP falls down...!
Through their shared structure and lexical items, the conditional clauses
reinforce the principal theme that the early Spanish people were superstitious.
At the same time, the conditional clauses develop the narrative by introducing
particular cases that exemplify this generalized theme.
21.1.5 Establishing a background setting (Scene-setting)
All initial conditional clauses set up a hypothetical scenario. However,
a subset of these specifically perform the task of establishing a background at
or near the beginning of a narrative. This background scene creates a context
for the rest of the events in the narrative. An example is the initial conditional
clause in the first line of the narrative in (19) (previously example (9)).","[464, 465]"

nature of the conditional relation. The main clause also has another irrealis
operator in the form of the particle kimini 'if so; in that case; then', which
only occurs in conditional relations.",[243]
"Inadditiontothesethreeconjunctions,thereisa fourthconjunction, wa ‘if; when', that explicitly codes the fact that the speaker is
not taking a stance regarding any expectation or probability that an event can
occur or will occur. Thus in terms of the variety of adverbial conjunctions that
can code a speaker’s stance with regard to hypotheticality and probability,
Barbareho Chumash is more explicit than English.
It is not surprising that languages may differ in the number of adverbial
conjunctions they use to code semantic relations, and in the finer or broader
distinctions they may make within such relations. These differences arise from
circumstances that are unique to each language in its history of use by a
community of speakers. On the other hand, as discussed in part IV, languages
show striking similarities in the ways that initial adverbial clauses build a
discourse, creating coherence among units of a text. The reason for these
similarities is that the coherence in the text reflects the coherence in the
cognitive processes that produce and comprehend the text, processes that all
humans share (see Givdn 1995 chapter 8, and the references to the
psychological literature he cites therein). I would therefore predict that further
case studies on adverbial clauses in other languages will prove to follow in this

localized, language-specific details of how the semantic relations are coded,
and similarities will be found in the more global, universal areas of the kinds
of tasks that initial and final adverbial clauses perform in the constructing of
a discourse.",[581]

<so that the ground would be smooth.>_Harrington and I differ on the translation of the Gukanu clause in line
d. The translation for oxmoloéin should be 'to be smooth'. (The verb thatmeans 'to smoothen; to make smooth’ is soxmoloGin (<su- causative +
oxmoloéin 'to be smooth')). In my analysis, the subject of the clause in d.
is the ground, not the people. Since the people contro] the texture of the
ground by sprinkling it with water, the adverbial subject pronoun (denoted by
aspirated [s}] in tSukanus""a?.. -) should be suppressed. Even if
Harrington’s translation were correct, one would still expect the adverbial
clause subject pronoun to be suppressed, because, again, it is the main clause
subject that has contro! over the situation in the adverbial clause: When one
looks at Harrington’s actual] handwriting for this token, the aspiration diacritic
looks like it may have been added in as an afterthought. A copy from the
microfilm is given below in (24). It shows how Harrington wrote line d. of

are seen in Harrington’s handwriting in (25) below. These are from different
texts. The first tSukanus“a?- sequence is from the Gukanu clause in
example (10) line b.; the second tSukanus""a2- sequence is. from the
éukanu clause in (11) line c. In both of these tokens, Harrington made ample
room for the aspiration between the segments s and a in the future tense
prefix sa2-. That is, the aspiration does not at all look as though Harrington
could have written it in as an afterthought. In both instances, in my analysis,
the aspiration should indeed be there just like it is in the attested forms.(25)

other phonetic material into his transcription, material which may possibly not
reflect the sounds as Mary Yee uttered them. It is hoped that a future analysis
will reveal that Harrington’ s transcription of the counter-examples does indeed
make sense in some as yet unrecognized grammatical pattern. In the
meantime, it is difficult to know what should be concluded from such cases.","[303, 304, 305, 306]"

Same-subject Gukanu clauses rarely occur in the corpus. There are
only 7 (out of 27) tokens. In two cases the subject pronoun is retained in the

then nthe
éukanu
clause, Gen
in the
other ininstances the subject pronoun is not retained. We
will first look at those cases in which the subject pronoun is retained.
12.1.1.1 Same-subject clauses in which the subject pronoun is retainedIn both instances where the subject pronoun is retained in a samesubject Gukanu clause, the main clause subject does not have control over
what it undergoes in the adverbial clause event. This is true even though the
main clause subject may instigate what eventually happens to itself in the
adverbialclause. In bothcases, the adverbial clause event concerns whathappens to the main clause subject as a result of ingesting cathartic or
hallucinogenic substances. The main clause subject thus lacks control over
what happens to itself in the adverbial clause event. This is reflected in the
morphosyntax by the fact that the adverbial clause retains subject marking on
the verb. For example, in (5), the main clause and the Gukanu clause have
the same subject and are indexed with the first person plural pronoun k-iy-.
The excerpt from the narrative depicts an ancient Chumash custom of
purifying oneself by drinking salt water from the ocean.

that they inevitably undergo in line b. Because the main clause subject lacks
control, the person marking in the adverbial clause is not suppressed. Hence
the adverbial clause retains same-subject person marking with k-iy- 'we'.
The example in (6) is the only other same-subject construction in which
the subject pronoun is retained in the adverbial clause. In the excerpt below,
262the main clause subject ingests some datura (also known as jimson weed) in
order to have a particular kind of vision, a vision in which he or she may
receive an 2atiSwin
(spirit helper), a special talent, or some other
advantage. The main clause subiect has no control over what he or she will
experience or receive in the adverbial clause event. According to Chumash
tradition, it is the datura (momoy) that determines what the person
experiences and receives during the vision. In the example below, the main
clause subject is an indefinite third person 'one/they', coded with the third
person subject pronoun s- and the indefinite prefix am- in line a. This same
pronoun likewise occurs in the adverbial clause in line b.

Part of the task of this dissertation was to determine the extent to
which the traditional semantic categories (temporal, conditional, concessive,
reason, purpose, and manner) are valid for adverbial clauses in Barbareho
Chumash. The following are strategies I used in determining which semantic
relation a given adverbial clause has. I did not assume that a given semantic
relation applies, across the board, to all of the tokens of a given adverbial
clause type. The semantic relation for a given adverbial clause was determined
on a case-by-case basis. In determining the meaning of a given adverbialclause, I first looked at (1) the context in which the clause occurs and (2)
Harrington’s gloss or translation for that clause. These were important factors
for me in deciding how to interpret the meaning of an adverbial clause and
its surrounding context. I will now take each semantic relation in turn and
describe how these were dealt with in the dissertation.
1.9.2.1 Temporal relationsAn adverbial clause was analyzed as being temporal if the event/state
expressed in the main clause could be shown to be anchored to the time of
the event/state in the adverbial clause. In such a case, I was usually able to
infer the specificity of the temporal relation from at least one of three factors:
(i) the tense/aspectual marking on the adverbial clause or main clause; (ii) a
semantically specific adverbial conjunction that clearly marks precedence,
subsequence, simultaneity, or a boundary in time (such as a terminalboundary); or, (iii) a lexically-specific indication of time in the adverbial clause
through a word that means ‘in the morning’, 'in the afternoon’, ‘at night’,
etc. If the adverbial conjunction was semantically unspecific with respect to
temporality, such as the Barbareho conjunction mali 'when', then I lookedespecially to criteria (i) and (iii) for help in determining whether the adverbial
clause was truly temporal. For example, the mali clause in (1) has the past
tense suffix -waS. This morpheme grounds the main clause in an identifiable
time frame set by the adverbial clause, such that the 3-day dieting that the
Chumash did (expressed in the main clause) occurs only after the drinking ofsea-water (expressed in the adverbial clause):°

<after they drank sea water.>Sometimes a semantically general adverbial conjunction appears with
other morphology (not necessarily tense-aspect morphology) that serves to
make that conjunction more semantically specific. For example, when the
emphatic proclitic tre appears with mali 'when', the meaning imparted is
one of a salient temporal boundary. This situation is illustrated in (2). The
main clause event in which one’s soul emerges from one’s body (line c.)
happens immediately upon the adverbial clause event of one’s death (line b.).","[37, 38, 39]"
"I have been privileged to know and count as friends many of the past
and present graduate students in the department of linguistics at UCSB. I
have learned much from them, and am grateful for the pillars of moral
Support that they have been during the years of my graduate study.
I wish to thank the Santa Barbara Museum of Natural History for
kindly providing the microfilms of J. P. Harrington’s manuscript materials as
well as Madison Beeler’s original manuscripts, thereby making this study
possible.

My earlier research on Barbareho Chumash was funded by gran
BNS90-11018 from the National Science Foundation (Marianne Mithun,
principal investigator). My M.A. thesis was part of that earlier research. I want
to thank Graeme Langley, whose moral support helped me get through that
very difficult time and move on to the next phase of my graduate study.
I am grateful for the heip and kind words i have received over the
years from Leanne Hinton, Martha Macri, Catherine Callaghan, Robert
Oswalt, Sally McLendon, Victor Golla and Margaret Langdon. Their belief in
the worth of my work on Miwok and Chumash languages has helped me find
the strength and resolve to continue doing it.
Of all my teachers and mentors I am especially indebted to Mr.
Domingo Ramirez, who was my 9th grade social studies teacher at SequoiaJunior High School. He apparently felt that I needed a greater challenge, so
he arranged for me to be put into classes for gifted/talented students when I
entered high school. Thanks to his initiative, I was put into the company of
kids who had high expectations for their futures, kids who not only took it for
granted that they would go to a four-year university, but that they would also
go on to earn doctoral degrees. That environment greatly expanded my view
of what I could do and be in this world. It was a precious gift for which I am
forever grateful.
Finally, I would like to express my thanks to some truly special people
in my life, people whose love, friendship, and support continue to make all the
difference in the world:To my parents, for believing in me and in my dreams. I thank them
also for the financial help and other material support they have generously
given during my years of graduate study.
To my sister and brother-in-law, for always wishing me well. I am also
grateful for their kids, whose entrance into this world has added a precious
dimension to my life.
To my boyfriend, Lawrence Morgan, for being extraordinarily loving
and supportive in countless ways.
To Steven Fincke, Robert Englebretson, Elisa Kamimoto, and Mary &Vern LeFever, for their priceless friendship and moral support over the
years.
Lastly, I give deepest thanks to God for all that I have and for all that
I am able to accomplish, including finally finishing this dissertation. ©VITA

Adverbial Clauses in BarbarehoChumash Narrative DiscourseBy
Suzanne WashThis dissertation presents the first study of adverbial clauses in
Barbareno Chumash, an indigenous language of California. It explores the
semantic relations, morphosyntactic structure, and discourse functions of
adverbial clauses in this language, with a view toward what is known and
expected about adverbial clauses crosslinguistically, and from a functionallyoriented approach to linguistics. Almost all of the data come from narratives
recorded in the 1950s by John Harrington from Mary Yee, the last speaker of
the Barbareho Chumash language.
The dissertation is divided into five parts. Part I is the preliminaries. It
includes a detailed grammatical sketch of the Barbareno Chumash language.
In Part II I analyze the semantic and morphosyntactic characteristics of
thirteen structurally-distinguishable adverbial clause types. The adverbial
clausescodetemporal,conditional,concessive,purposive,reason/causal,manner, and semantically neutral relations. Semantically neutral adverbial
clauses have both temporal and conditional meanings, and though most
researchers treat such clauses as conditional, in this study I treat them as a
category separate from the temporal and conditional categories. In Part TI I
compare the initial and final tokens of these clause types with respect to
similaritiesanddifferencesinstructure,extentofscope,andpunctuation/prosodic boundaries. In Part IV I focus on the similarities and
differences in discourse functions between initial and final clauses that code
purposive, conditional, temporal and semantically neutral relations. In addition
to their qualifying role, the initial adverbial clauses function as pivotal points
of orientation that help create a cohesive and coherent text. However, the
final adverbial clauses only serve to qualify the main clause. They do not
function as pivotal points of orientation in a discourse. These differences
between initial and final adverbial clauses are found crosslinguistically, and
reflect the general cognitive processes involved in the production and
comprehension of discourse (Giv6n 1995). Finally, I conclude this study withthe closing remarks in Part V.,

Introduction1.1 Purpose of this studyThis dissertation presents the first study of adverbial clauses in
Barbareho Chumash, an indigenous language of California. The goals of the
dissertation are two-fold. First, it describes what adverbial clauses look like in
this language, sorting them into types that correspond to certain structural
criteria. Second, it explores discourse-functional explanations for the ways in
which the adverbial clauses pattern as they do in Barbareho Chumash
narratives. Both of these goals are met with a view toward what is known and
expected about adverbial clauses cross-linguistically, in both their grammatical
and discourse-functional properties.
Much has been published on adverbial clauses. Almost all studies on
adverbial clauses, however, use constructed sentences for data. Relatively few
studies have examined adverbial clauses within the context of non-constructed,connected discourse, such as monologic narratives and conversation. This
dissertation not only examines adverbial clauses from a discourse context, but
it also provides a rare, in-depth look at adverbial clauses in an American
Indian language. For the reasons cited above, this study aims to be a worthy
contribution to the cross-linguistic literature on adverbial clauses and, more
generally, to discourse-functional perspectives on language.
1.2 Geographic and linguistic affiliation of the Barbareno Chumash language
Barbareno belongs to the Chumashan family of languages. The original
territory of the Chumash people extends along the California coast from a
little beyond San Luis Obispo in the north down to Malibu in the south. It
extends inland, bordering the San Joaquin valley. It also includes the Santa
Barbara Channel Islands, three of which were inhabited year around: Santa
Cruz, Santa Rosa and San Miguel. The Barbareho language itself was spoken
in the present-day Santa Barbara county, roughly in an area from Refugio
Beach to Carpinteria. The last known speaker of Barbareho was Mary Yee,
who died in 1965.
The word Chumash originates from ehumas ‘islander', a term used
by mainlanders. However, if the word &uma is derived from the same root
as the Barbareno word 2anéum ‘money; shell bead money', as I believe
2it is,’ then the original meaning of the word éhumas has more to do with the
fact that the islanders were the producers of money. The ancestors of the
present-day Chumash had a market economy long before the Europeans
arrived, They used precisely-measured strings of shell-bead money as their
currency. The islanders produced this currency for export and trade to the
mainland. The islands of Santa Cruz, Santa Rosa and San Miguel were mints
in the literal sense of the word. See King 1976, Hudson & Blackburn 1986 and
Arnold 1987 for detailed information on this subject.
Chumashan has two major branches with at least six languages. Earlier
classifications were later refined in Klar 1973, 1977, 1981, and Mithun 1999,Known dialectal divisions are given in parentheses.

Venturenho: (Mugu, Malibu, Shisholop, Matilija, Ojai-Santa PaulaSespe- Castac)
Island Chumash [also referred to as Ysleno]: (Cruzeho, Roseho, Migueleho)
Most of the names for the Chumash languages are derived from the
names of the mission communities in which their speakers lived: Obispeno,
fromMissionSanLuisObispo;Purisimeno,fromMissionLaPurisimaConcepcién; Ineseho or Ynesefio, from Mission Santa Ynez; Barbareho, from
Mission Santa Barbara; and Ventureho, from Mission San Buenaventura. The
name of the sixth member of Chumashan, IslandChumash, comes from thefact that its three dialects were spoken by people who lived on the Santa
Barbara Channel Islands: Cruzenho, from Santa Cruz Island; Roseho, from
Santa Rosa Island; and Migueleno, from San Miguel Island.
Much remains to be understood about the dialectal divisions within
each Chumash language. Until all of Harrington’s notes are thoroughly
analyzed, definite conclusions about the dialectal differences within each of the
Chumash languages will have to wait.","[5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25]"

Initial and final conditional clauses in Barbareho Chumash perform
vastly different tasks within a narrative discourse. All conditional clauses
qualify and limit the message of the associated main clause(s). However, only
initial conditionals clauses serve as pivotal points in the organization of
information within the discourse. We saw several ways in which they
contribute to the development of a discourse: they introduce options and
alternatives to one or more choices given earlier in the discourse, they may
introduce information that contrasts with information given earlier in the
discourse, they may repeat claims, they may serve to exemplify a preceding
generalization, or they may establish a background setting for the rest of the
narrative. In these capacities, conditional clauses constitute unchallenged
hypothetical contexts that serve as a framework for interpreting ensuing
propositions.
The Barbareho data further support the crosslinguistic generalization,
first noted by Haiman (1978), that conditional clauses and topics, e.g. topical
NPs, share fundamental similarities. Both are similar in marking in that they
tend overwhelmingly to be followed by the topical marker 2i=. Secondly, all
topical NPs and almost all conditional clauses occur preposed to associated
455material, and in that position they establish frames of reference and
interpretation for ensuing information.
Conditional clauses that do not have such global roles in the discourse
tend to occur in final position. In Barbareho Chumash, certain factors or
environments appear to motivate the final position of a conditional clause. In
one environment, the main clause has other associated preposed material,
such as a left-dislocated NP or another adverbial clause, which is already
serving as a guidepost for the interpretation of the information that follows it.
In another environment the main clause might be embedded. In such cases,
the conditional clause does not intervene between its embedded main clause
and the verb or noun that heads that embedded clause. In other cases, themain clause clause may be conjoined with one or more (preceding) clauses
which name a set of related actions or situations. The flow of information is
being organized through these independent clauses. A preposed conditional
clause in such cases would disrupt the smooth flow of information. Finally, in
some environments, postposed conditional clauses serve as afterthoughts to
already-completed utterances. In all these cases, final conditional clauses serve
only to qualify or complete the message of their associated main clauses.","[476, 477, 478]"

third person indirect object pronoun. However, they also noted that one could
analyze ~us as part of the verb stem, indicating that the verb has a goal or
benefactive NP. In this dissertation I follow the latter analysis. That is, I
analyze -us as an applicative, not a pronoun. In this respect I follow
Tsuyoshi Ono’s analysis in his 1996 dissertation. He gives clear and wellgrounded reasons why -us is better analyzed as a core argument-building
device, one that turns would-be obliques into direct objects.
2. [have regularized the orthography in the paradigms from both Harrington’s
and Beeler’s notes.
3. Beeler translated the verbs in this paradigm using the past tense, ic. 'I
thought, you thought, he thought’, etc.
4. I thank Richard Applegate for pointing out to me this particular distinction
between -waS and -iwaé.
5. There is another possible interpretation for the constituent order in the
clause in (245). Harrington’s free translation for this clause is ‘she had her
face covered with a cloth'. Based on Harrington’s translation, Ono (1996:62)
analyzed the NP ‘a white cloth' as an oblique NP with a semantic role as
instrument.
6. Cf. Beeler and Whistler 1980:95, note 32, in regard to the nominalized verbhi=l=yinéiin (265). They state: 'Literally ""one which is hot"". Attributiveto the following NP.' My analysis of nominalized clauses essentially takes the
opposite view: it is the following NP, 'a rock', that elaborates upon the
information in the nominalized verb. The following NP ('rock') in effect
delineates ‘what is hot’.
7. It is easy to confuse the subordinative prefix ~al- with the stativizing
prefix 2al-, especially in cases where floating glottalization occurs.
Historically the two morphemes are probably connected. In most of the cases
in Beeler and Whistler 1980 where the underlying form is given as -al-, I
would analyze it as 2al~. A full treatment of these two morphemes is beyond
the scope of this study. However, since -al- often occurs in pragmatically
113marked constructions, I certainly agree with their analysis that -al- '...can
perhaps better be seen as marking a weak focussing of the verbal force,
paralleling the function of some clefts in English' (1980:92, note 3).
8. The contrastive focus proclitic ka= appears to be descended from a protoChumash demonstrative, *ka, which has at least four reflexes in Barbareho:
i) the contrastive focus proclitic ka=; ii) the stative proclitic ka=, which isstative with contrastive force and often appears in cleft constructions; iii) a
very rare relativizer ka=; and 4) an equally rare complementizer ka=. A
possible fifth reflex of the proto-Chumash demonstrative *ka
is the
ubiquitous, semantically-bleached proclitic ka=, which roughly translates as
‘then, so'. It is commonly seen following the topicalizer 2i= and in
conjunctions such as kimka'then; and then’ and hika'and, sEQUENTIAL'.","[132, 133, 134, 135, 136]"

In Barbarenho, a clause with full subject and object NPs generally has
a Verb-Object-Subject (VOS) structure. Most clauses have at most one full
NP, however (Ono 1996). The verb-initial word order occurs in independent
clauses as well as dependent clauses, such as complement clauses, relative
clauses, and adverbial clauses. Preverbal NPs are pragmatically marked and
are typically not part of the clause that follows. Usually these NPs are set off
by topic or focus particles. Finally, nominalized clauses are common in
Chumash languages. These may occur as subject or object complements,
relative clauses, part of cleft constructions, or as free NPs.
The following topics are treated in 2.3: basic clause structure (2.3.1),
two-verb predicates (2.3.2), the morphosyntax of nominalized clauses (2.3.3),
pragmatically-marked constructions (2.3.4), complement-taking predicates and
their complement clauses (2.3.5), relative clauses (2.3.6), and appositive
clauses (2.3.7). The chapter ends with examples of coordination in 2.3.8.
2.3.1Basic clause structureThe Barbareno clause is typically verb-initial, though the verb may be
preceded by modifiers, conjunctions and cliticized connectives. The clause may
or may not have full NP arguments and oblique adjuncts. If there is more than
one full NP within the clause, then the following orders normally prevail:

objects (ones that are semantic patients) and subjects. All core arguments
precede non-core NPs. Syntactically-dependent constituents within the clause
are typically marked with the proclitic hi=. Following are examples of various

"114Part ITypes of Adverbiai Ciauses115Introduction to Part IEBarbareno Chumash is a language with a rich variety of adverbial
clause constructions. In this part of the dissertation I discuss and illustrate the
subtleties and complexities one finds in the syntax, morphology and semantics
of this domain of Barbareho grammar.
Barbareho adverbial clauses code a variety of semantic relations with
main clauses, including temporal, conditional, concessive, purposive, reason,
and manner relations. Some adverbial clause types code only one of these
relations, whereas others code several of them. Some of the adverbial clausetypes, however, have tokens that are semantically neutral with respect to
conditionality and time.
As we explore the ways in which these adverbial clause types code
semantic relations, we will come upon interesting issues and striking
grammatical patterns. Some of these are discussed and predicted in the
typological literature on adverbial clauses, in particular Thompson and
Longacre 1985 and Givén 1990. For example, it is known that adverbial
conjunctions that are semantically unspecific, like English 'when', generally
need to be accompanied by specific tense and aspectual morphology, and/or
lexical temporal indicators, in order to code specific kinds of temporal
relations unambiguously. We see further confirmation of this generalization in
such Barbareho adverbial clause types as mali ‘when' in chapter 6, na if;
when' in chapter 8, and wa ‘if; when' in chapter 9. These adverbial clause
types code temporal relations as well as other kinds of relations.
One often finds conditional relations to be indicated and underscored
by the modal morphology of a language. We will see that this is also the case
for conditional relations coded by Barbareno adverbial clauses, specifically
haku'if' clauses in chapter 7,na‘if; when'clauses in chapter 8, and wa‘if; when' clauses in chapter 9.
Distinctive patterns of pronominal subject marking are well known and
expected in purposive relations. In English, for example, subject marking can
be suppressed in same-subject purpose clauses. In chapter 12, we will see in
the Gukanu clause type, which codes only purposive relations, that subject
marking may be suppressed in either same-subject or different-subject purpose
clauses. We will see that the semantics of agency and control is the motivating
factor that affects pronominal suppression in this adverbial clause type. In
other Barbareho adverbial clause types, however, just the fact that the
116adverbial clause has the same subject as the main clause is enough to create
a semantic bond that is tight enough to allow such pronominal suppression.
We will see this pattern in simultaneous temporal relations coded by
2akimpi ? ‘during; while' clauses in chapter 5, reason relations coded by
kayké
'because' clauses in chapter 14, and finally in manner relations
coded by kaneé
'like; as if‘ clauses in chapter 16. Pronominal subject
suppression is attested only for third person subjects--first and second person
subject pronouns are always retained in the adverbial clause.
Sometimes mentioned in the crosslinguistic literature is the fact that an
adverbial conjunction may code the speaker’s or narrator’s expectations with
regard to the likelihood that a given event will occur. For example in English,
the conjunction 'when' connotes a greater expectation or likelihood than the
conjunction ‘if'. In the grammar of Barbareho Chumash adverbial clauses,
this is an important and complex category. Several adverbial conjunctions play
a role in coding the speaker’s point of view with regard to when and whether
an event can occur, will occur, or could have already occurred: mali‘if;when' clauses (chapter 6), haku 'if' clauses (chapter 7), na ‘if; when'
clauses (chapter 8), and wa _ ‘if; when' clauses (chapter 9). See also the
2akay hu ‘until' clauses in chapter 4 and 2iyeme ‘though; although'
clauses in chapter 10.
Barbareno Chumash has two adverbial clause types that code
distinctions in reason relations. The Kayké 'because' clauses (chapter 14)
tend to provide motivations for acts performed through talk such as
commands and claims, and reasons for conclusions that are inferred. The
ihehu ""because, since, from' clauses (chapter 15) code causal relations in
whichoneeventcausesanothereventtooccur.","[136, 137, 138, 139]"
"1.3 Sources of primary data
The data in this study come primarily from John P. Harrington’s
manuscript materials of linguistic and ethnographic work among the Chumash
people. These are catalogued in Mills and Brickfield 1986. Harrington’s notes
and recordings are the largest primary source of data for all of the Chumash
languages. From his work on the Barbarenho language alone he produced tens
of thousands of pages of field notes. From 1913 until a few years before his
death in 1961, Harrington worked with some of the last known speakers of
Barbareno. The best known of these were Luisa Ignacio, Juliana Ignacio, Juande Jesus Justo, Lucrecia Garcia, and Mary Yee. All of these people were
bilingual in Barbareho and Spanish; Mary Yee was also fluent in English. In
addition, Lucrecia Garcia and Mary Yee were able to read and write in
Barbareho. The data used in my study are mostly from the texts and
grammatical notes recorded by Harrington on paper from Mary Yee. Data
from other speakers will be cited when necessary.
During the time of his fieldwork, Harrington recorded languages on
paper, wax cylinders and aluminum discs. Convenient tools such as magnetic
tape recorders were not available until late in his career. He used a detailed
but idiosyncratic phonetic transcription when writing down a language, andoften did not write phonemically.? The consensus among linguists who knowHarrington’s work is that he had an extraordinarily acute ear for phoneticdetail (Callaghan1975,1976). ThusHarrington’s written recordingsofAmerican Indian languages are valued by present-day linguists for their
accuracy and reliability.
A second corpus of primary discourse data comes from Madison
Beeler, who worked with Mary Yee during a series of field trips from about
1954 through the early 1960s. To my knowledge, this corpus contains several
dozen notebooks and nine tape recordings.
William Bright worked with Mary Yee for a brief period in 1952. His
notes consist of wordlists and short paradigms.
There are other primary sources of data on Chumash languages. These
sources are primarily wordlists recorded in the 1700s and 1800s. The more
well-known of these were recorded by Arroyo de la Cuesta in 1833-36, Pinart
in 1878 (published in Heizer 1952), and Henshaw in 1884 (published in Heizer
1955).
1.4 Previous analyses of Barbareno Chumash*
A truly thorough description of the Barbareho Chumash language has
yet to appear, but one may find a clear and concise orientation to Barbareno4discourse and grammar in Ono’s 1996 dissertation. Sketches and analyses of
the Barbareno language are also found in Beeler 1970a and 1976, and in the
extensive, detailed footnotes given in Beeler and Whistler 1980. Detailed
discussions on dependent marking, relative clauses and related structures are
given in Wash 1999a and 1999b. There are also discussions and illustrative
examples touching upon many aspects of Barbareho grammar in Harrington’s
notes, especially in Reel 3, Volume 3, of the Kraus Microfilm Reel Edition(Mills and Brickfield 1986). In addition to these sources there are two articles
on the placement and functions of glottalization (Mithun et al. 1994, Ono et
al. 1994). Two studies have been published on sibilant harmony in Barbareho
(Beeler 1970b, Mithun 1997). Finally, there is a phonological study on
reduplication, which is a prominent phonological and grammatical process in
all Chumash languages (Wash 1995).
No comprehensive dictionary of the Barbareno language has yet been
published. However, Beeler (1979) published a list of approximately 1,000
words, Whistler (1980) followed up on this work with a working dictionary
containing about 2,000 words. There is also a helpful glossary of terms from
several different Chumash languages. in volume five of the Hudson and
Blackburn (1986) series.
1.5 Theoretical orientation
This dissertation is based on a functionally-oriented approach to
linguistics. A functionally-oriented approach seeks to understand language in
all of its cognitive, communicative, socio-cultural and diachronic aspects. It is
the complex way in which these aspects of language interact that accounts for
the patterns observed in human languages, both individually and on a crosslinguistic basis. The complex interaction of these aspects of language is best
seen in the ways language is actually used. Hence, when linguists who follow
this approach seek to describe and explain why certain forms or structures
pattern as they do in a given language, they want to work with as much
context of the language as possible. They seek to have a database that is built
upon connected discourse rather than only single forms and structures elicited
out of context, the latter being the standard for some schools of linguistics.
Thus if the language under investigation has a community of speakers, a
functionally-oriented linguist will seek to record as many genres of naturally
occurring discourse as possible, including conversation and the telling of
stories. Such recordings are audiotaped and/or videotaped, and are
subsequently transcribed in a systematic way (e.g. Du Bois et al. 1993). From
such data, both qualitative analyses (e.g. Chafe 1980) and quantitative analyses
5(e.g. Givén 1983, Du Bois 1987, Fox and Thompson 1990 and Ford 1993
among many others) are possible.
One broad area of functional approaches to linguistics that is used in
this dissertation is the theory of INFORMATION FLOW (Chafe1976, 1987,1992,1994). According to this theory, the changing cognitive state of information in
the minds of the speaker and hearer motivate particular linguistic forms and
structures. For example, newly mentioned referents are commonly coded as
full NPs, because in this form the hearer is able to identify who the speaker
is talking about. Subsequent mentions of the same referent usually take
pronominal form, e.g. English 'he', 'she', 'it'. These forms of the referent
reflect its Given cognitive status. This theory is particularly helpful in part four
of this dissertation as we examine the relationship between mentions of
referents and clausal ordering in adverbial clause constructions.
The theory of information flow is connected to some extent to the
principle of least effort in the production and processing of language (Zipf
1935). This principle, along with the functionally-oriented notion of iconic and
economic motivation in language (Haiman 1983) will be shown to be relevant
in understanding the various patterns one finds with initial and final adverbial
clauses in Barbareno discourse, in parts three and four of the dissertation.
1.6 Literature review
Taken as a whole, the literature on adverbial clauses is immense. Thistopic has been written about from vastly different perspectives not only within
linguistics, but within other fields of learning such as philosophy. As discussed
in section 1.8, my data on Barbareno adverbial clauses occur within narrative
discourse. Most of the vast literature on adverbial clauses, however, deals withconstructed data. I am particularly interested in studies that examine adverbial
clauses within a discourse context, such as monologic narrative or
conversation, because such studies focus on questions and issues that are most
relevant to a functionally-oriented perspective on language. The following are
some of the sources that inform my descriptions and analyses of adverbial
clauses in Barbarefo, though these of course are not the whole extent of my
references to the adverbial clause literature in the dissertation: Haiman 1978,Chafe 1984, Thompson 1985, Thompson and Longacre 1985, Ford and
Thompson 1986, Matthiessen and Thompson 1988, Givén 1990, and Ford
1993,
Some of the sources mentioned above give an overview of adverbial
clauses from a functional and cross-linguistic perspective. Givén (1990)
discusses adverbial clauses in his chapter on interclausal coherence. First he
6gives a typology of adverbial clauses by semantic category, i.e. temporal,
conditional, cause and reason, concessive, substitutive, additive, and purposive.","[25, 26, 27, 28, 29]"

The other three exceptional tokens show an absence of the third
singular pronoun s- on the Gu clause verb. These tokens are seen below in
(15) through (17). In each case, the main clause subject has more control over
the situation than the adverbial clause subject. However, as will become clear,
the issue of control is not what motivates the absence of person marking on
the Gu clause verb. An explanation of why the person affix is missing will be
given following the presentation of examples (15) through (17).
In (15) line b., the main clause subject is a shaman who took steps to

as predicates. For example, in (18) (previously example (1)), the differentsubject kayké clause has the word 'leader' as its predicate. Hence it has the
stative 2a1~ instead of the third person pronoun s~. The subject of the main
clause in line c. is a group of Chumash Indians, the subject of the kayké
clause in line d. is a padre. In this example, the main clause verb is in the
imperative mode, and thus lacks person marking.

"Apposition is also one of the ways in which an NP can be pragmaticallymarked (T. Payne 1997), but for purposes of comparison with relativization,
81appositive clauses are discussed in the section immediately following the
section on relative clauses. In the next three subsections I will illustrate ways
in which fronting, left-dislocation and clefting occur in Barbareho Chumash.
2.3.4.1Fronting
As we saw in 2.3.1, neutral or basic clauses in Barbareho Chumash are
verb initial. Occasionally, however, one finds in the corpus that NPs arefronted before the verb within the clause. When fronting occurs, there is no
special ""focus"" or other kind of particle that separates the fronted NP from the
rest of the clause. Also, in Harrington’s transcriptions, no comma or other
kind of punctuation was ever found to separate the fronted NP from the rest
of the clause. Presumably, then, the fronted NP falls under a single intonationcontour with the rest of the clause. Finally, in all cases of fronting in
Barbareho, the fronted NP is an oblique. No cases of fronted core-arguments
have been found. Below are several examples of fronting.","[103, 104]"

salient temporal boundary denoted in the adverbial clause in line b.
Sometimes in a maii clause construction there is no specific
morphology, in either the adverbial clause or the main clause, that indicates
a temporal relation. I still posit a temporal relation, however, if the mali
clause contains a word that specifies the time frame. This would satisfy
criterion (iii). For example in the text in (3), which is a procedural text aboutmaking posoli, the word ‘it is morning’ establishes the time frame in which
the main clause events

tense-aspect marking in the adverbial clause, the adverbial clause conjunction
is not semantically specific, and there is no lexical item within the adverbial
that indicates a time frame, a temporal interpretation of the adverbial clause
is still possible if the pragmatics of the context demands it. In these cases, I
also apply a process of elimination by seeing, for example, if the adverbial
clause makes just as much sense with a conditional interpretation, or a reason
interpretation, etc. In (4) and (5) there are two adverbial clauses from the
same procedural text, both of which happen to be minimal pairs. The version
in (4) appears to be a constructed sentence. The two adverbial conjunctions
in question, mali 'when' ((4) line d.) and wa ‘if; when' ((5) line c.) are
semantically non-specific. Both adverbial clauses have a temporal
interpretation in this context, however, because the context does not permitany other interpretation.

drying process is something that happens to the wooden bowl, as a matter of
course, after the coating of lard has been applied. A conditional interpretation
is therefore not possible with the adverbial clauses in (4) and (5), even though
the adverbial conjunction wa, in (5), can occur in clauses that have a
conditional interpretation. Only a temporal relation is acceptable for this
token.
1.9.2.2 Neutral relations
Sometimes none of the three criteria discussed above for temporal
clauses apply, nor does the context render a specific semantic interpretation.
In such cases, the would-be temporal clause can also have a conditional
meaning. Adverbial clauses in these cases are semantically neutral with respect
to conditionality and time. Two examples of neutralized adverbial clauses, a
na clause and a mali clause, are seen below in (6).

2-thoughtno se echa de ver que tienes mal pensamiento. '
<the fact that your thoughts are bad is not evident.>The adverbial clauses in lines a. and c. do not show clear evidence of
being temporal clauses or conditional clauses. For example, unlike most mali
clauses that have a temporal relation to the main clause, the mali clause in
line c. has no morphosyntax or lexical items that link the event in the main
clause to a specific time frame. Both the na and mali 'ifAvhen' clauses code
generic, habitual situations. The temporal and conditional relations are
conflated for those tokens. Neutralization of conditionality and time is
discussed briefly in Thompson and Longacre 1985:193. Most researchers put
neutral, 'ifAwhen' clauses into the conditional category (e.g. Thompson (p.c.),
Comrie1986, ter Meulen1986, Hacker 1998). In this dissertation, however,I treat neutral 'iffwhen' clauses as belonging to a category separate from the
conditional and temporal semantic categories.
1.9.2.3 Conditional relationsGenerally, an adverbial clause that provides the condition(s) under
which the event/state in the main clause occurs is analyzed in this dissertation
as a conditional clause. However, as discussed earlier, conditional relations canbe conflated with temporal relations in Barbareno, with the result that the
clause in question may not be a true conditional clause, even if it has an
adverbial conjunction that Harrington translates as ‘if’. In identifying a
21conditional clause, then, I looked for the following factors: (i) the adverbial
clause must code a hypothetical, i.e. unreal, situation; and, (ii) the main clause
must have one or more of the following features (following Givén 1990:829)
all of which underscore the irrealis nature of conditional constructions: the
modal verb uniyiw ‘to be necessary, to have to, should', the modal verb
alaqway‘can, to be able', the future tense prefix sa?-, the modal particlemay ‘would, should', a marker of certainty such as the particle pa ‘must be,
must have', the hortative particle kuhhe 'let it not be (that)', the particle
kimini 'then (in that case)', an imperative verb, an indirect request, or a
question. Negation in the main clause was another criterion I considered, since
in some languages all clauses that have negation are treated as irrealis (T.
Payne 1997). I decided not to treat negation as one of the structural criteria
in the identification of a conditional relation. However, in those cases whereI gave a conditional interpretation based on a pragmatic interpretation of the
context, i.e. where none of the above structural criteria were found in theassociated main clause, it was almost always the case that the main clause had
negation. These judgment calls were rare, however.
Following Givén (1990:831) a counterfactual conditional relation was
identified as one in which: (i) the adverbial clause has a firm and negative
truth-value; (ii) the adverbial clause has a realis operator such as the past
tense suffix -wa5; and finally, (iii) the main clause has an irrealis operator
such as future tense or a modal particle. Counterfactual clauses are rare in my
corpus, however.
The passage below has several conditional clauses: a conditional na
clause (line a.), a conditional haku clause (line c.), and a counterfactualconditional haku clause (line f.).

punctuated with a colon, the adverbial clause is immediately followed by

nominalized relative clauses will have the subordinative prefix -al-, but nonnominalized relative clauses will lack this prefix. As recalled from section 2.3.3,

subordinative prefix -al-. For example, the Object-relative clause in (331) is

verb has a second person subject, like the relative clause verb in (331) above.
However, since the relative clause in (332) is not nominalized, it lacks the
subordinative prefix -al-.

Appositive clauses are noun phrases that have the same referent as the
noun they follow. In the sentence John, the guy who always sits in the back,
can speak five languages, the appositive clause is the guy who always sits in
the back. It is in apposition with the noun John. As is true for all languages,
the syntactic relation between the first NP and its appositive clause is
paratactic, not hypotactic (Halliday 1994). Thus the appositive clause the guy
who always sits in the back is not syntactically dependent on the NP John.
In Barbareno Chumash, an appositive clause construction has the
following characteristics. First, the dependent proclitic hi= does not cliticize
to the appositive clause, as it does on relative clauses, because the appositive
clause is not syntactically dependent on its preceding noun. Exceptions are
rare. Second, the appositive clause is nominalized. Finally, a typical appositive
clause has one of the deictic proclitics, ie. he2='PROXIMAL',ho2?='DISTAL',or hu= ‘remote! attached to it. Often this deictic clitic will match the deictic
clitic on the preceding NP in the appositive relation.
Following are some examples of appositive clauses in Barbareno
Chumash. In (333), the NP 'the arrows’ is followed by the appositive clause
‘the ones they used to use for waging war'. Both NPs in the appositive
relation have the remote deictic proclitic hu=.

is followed by the appositive clause ' the one the swordfish threw up [onto the
shore]'. Both NPs in the appositive relation have the proximal deictic proclitic
he?=. In the second set, the NP 'the people' is followed by the appositive
clause 'the ones whose property that porn iis'. Both NPs have the distal
deictic proclitic ho2?=. In the last line of the excerpt, the demonstrative
particle 2akim 'there' is followed by the appositive clause ‘at the place
where the whale was beached '. The appositive clause in that relation has the
distal deictic clitic ho?=. It is also one of the rare tokens of appositive clauses
that has the dependent clitic hi=.

"Each of the three clauses has the existential verb wil 'to be' followed by a
nominalized clause. The nominalized verb in each case lacks a subject
pronoun because, as shown in Chapter 2, Barbarenho nominalized verbs withthird person subjects do not have subject pronouns except under certain
exceptional conditions.! The same-subject Gukanu clauses in lines b., d'. and
g. also lack a subject pronoun, but for a different reason: the main clause
subject has control over what happens to itself in the adverbial clause event,
and this control is reflected by the suppression of the subject pronoun in the
adverbial clause. If these adverbial clauses had subject marking, one would see
the third person pronoun, s-. The Gukanu clause in line b. would look like
*Gukanu
s-iy-sa?-towié. The one in line d'. would appear as
*Gukanu=s-—iy-sa2-watiple?. Finally, the one line g. would appear as
*éukanu=s-iy-sa2?-uSkal. In lines a. and b. of example (7) above, people
who wear the hummingbird talisman are able to make themselves be quick
like a hummingbird, at will. They have total control over when, where, and
how they are quick and agile, just like a hummingbird would be.” In lines c.
and d*., people who wear the skunk claw talisman are able to make
themselves invisible. By using this talisman, they have full control over when
and how long they are seen or unseen. Finally, in lines f. and g., those who
wear the bear claw talisman are able to make themselves much stronger than
normal, at will, by using that talisman. The point again is that the main clause
subjects in (7) have full control over what they do, become or undergo in the
adverbial clause event. The grammar reflects this greater degree of control
through the suppression of the subject pronoun in the adverbial clause.",[287]

Initial and final purpose clauses in Barbareno Chumash differ vastly in
the kinds of work they do in narrative discourse. These differences in function
are further reflected in differences in scope, frequency and structure.
.
Initial purpose clauses in Barbareno typically have a global, textual role
in the organization of discourse. The context that precedes an initial purpose
clause gives rise to certain assumptions or expectations, either explicitly or
implicitly, which are then addressed by the purpose clause in the form of a
proposition that states a goal or problem to be solved. The purpose clause
then serves as a point of orientation for the procedure or solution conveyed
by the clauses that follow it. The purpose clause thus contextualizes the
information that follows it with the information that precedes it. Much less
frequently, an initial purpose clause will not so much serve as a guidepost but
rather as an alternative or contrasting option. Significantly, all initial purpose
clauses are followed by the topic marker 2i= in the immediately succeeding
main clause, underscoring the thematic role that the purpose clause is
endowed with. A further indication of the global role that initial purpose
clauses may have is
their extent of scope. In this study they had an average scope of 6.38 clauses,
and in two cases the scope extended beyond 10 clauses.
Final purpose clauses have a local, semantic function within narrative
discourse. They code the purpose for the action that occurs in the associated
main clause. They do not respond to assumptions and expectations raised
elsewhere in the narrative, nor do they serve as point of orientation for the
reader. This limited, local function is underscored by the limited scope that
final purpose clauses have. The Barbareho data showed that they rarely have
a scope beyond one associated clause, and even the rare exceptions never
have a scope beyond two clauses.
Initial and final purpose clauses differ greatly in frequency: 91% of the
purpose clauses are postposed, 9% are preposed. I argued that this disparity
reflects the fact that initial purpose clauses overwhelmingly occur in
procedural narratives, while the majority of final clauses occur in non421procedural narratives. Procedural narratives are not a kind genre that
commonly occurs in daily discourse, hence initial purpose clauses, which tend
to be limited to this genre, do not occur as frequently as final purpose clauses.
Finally, initial and final purpose clauses differ somewhat in structure.
Initial purpose clauses belong to the na clause type only. As we saw in
chapter 8, the na conjunction typically has the meaning ‘if' or 'when'; its
purposive meaning is rare. Final purpose clauses never have this conjunction,
but instead may have the dependent proclitic hi= or any one of several
conjunctions: Gu 'so that, in order to', Gukanu
‘so that...not; lest! and mehu 'in order to'.'so that, in order to', kuThese findings give more crosslinguistic support for Thompson’s (1985)
assertion that initial and final purpose clauses are different structures, and that
their position in narrative discourse is iconically motivated (in relation to the
notions of iconicity discussed in Haiman 1983). A purpose clause whose
function is to orient the reader’s attention with respect to a certain goal or
problem, contextualizing the solution that follows it with the assumptions and
expectations that come before it, can only fulfill that function by following
those clauses whose assumptions and expectations it responds to and by
preceding those clauses that name the solution. On the other hand, a purpose
clause whose function is simply to complete the information of its main clause
is more easily processed following its main clause. If all that a purpose clause
is doing is expressing the goal of a given action, then the simplest and
cognitively easiest arrangement is for it to be postposed, because in real time
the event named by the main clause will precede the event or goal named by
the purpose clause.","[443, 444]"

'<Then they boil it for about two hours.>In some cases there is no explicit indication of a simultaneous temporal
relation. For example, there may not be any imperfective morphology in either
the mali‘when’clause or the main clause. In such cases, a simultaneoustemporal relation can only be inferred from the meaning of the context as a
whole. An illustration is seen in (21). In the adverbial clause event (line c.),
an acorn-shaped configuration of medicinal leaves is burning down onto the
patient’s sore. This event happens at the same time as the main clause event
in line d., in which the patient is suffering from the pain. Neither clause shows
the kind of imperfective morphology seen in the earlier examples.","[191, 192]"
"The chain makes that both wheels are the same size.’The 2akimpi ‘during, while' clause above is ambiguous as to its
status as an adverbial clause, since Harrington’s punctuation and translation
render it a complete sentence on its own. It can be interpreted as an
afterthought adverbial clause, since crosslinguistically such clauses tend to
occur in an intonation unit separate from the preceding main clause (Chafe
1984; Givén 1990); or, it can be interpreted as an independent clause, with the
meaning ‘at that time they had not yet invented the chain'.
There is no preferential order for this adverbial clause type. Half of the
tokens are preposed, the other half are postposed. One difference between
preposed and postposed ?akimpi ‘during, while' clauses is found in samevs. different-subject marking. All preposed 2akimpi ‘during, while' clauses
have a subject that is different than that of the main clause, e.g. (4) and (6)
above, but three out of the four postposed 2akimpi ‘during, while' clauses
have a subject that is the same as that of the main clause, e.g. (5) above. The
one postposed 2akimpi ‘during, while' clause that has a different subject
is the one in (7) above, which as noted is ambiguous in its status as an
adverbial clause.
There also seems to be some difference with regard to pronominal
marking in the adverbial clause verb, though without more tokens one cannot
make a strong claim. For the preposed tokens, there tends to be full
pronominal subject marking in both the adverbial clause and its corresponding
main clause. The only exception is in (8) below, where the stative prefix 2aloccurs instead of the third person pronoun s- on a predicate noun. This
145would be expected since one of the ways for nouns to become verbalized is
through a stative morpheme such as 2al-~, and the third person subject
pronoun s- is never found to be prefixed to this morpheme. (See chapter 2
regarding the mutually-exclusive distribution of the stative prefix ?al-— and thethird pronominal prefix s- in verbs.)

clitic hi= and the distal deictic clitic ho?=, this siy- is probably the third
person plural possessive prefix commonly found on nouns and nominal
themes, rather than the third person plural subject siy- that is prefixed to
verbal themes.
Two of the final 2akimpi ‘during, while' clause tokens do not have
subject marking because the adverbial clause subject is third person singular,
and the verb has the stative prefix 2al-. As noted previously, the third person
subject pronoun is never found prefixed to that stative morpheme. The first
example of this, for a postposed 2akimpi ‘during, while' clause, was seen
in (5) with the verb 2al-wulaéu 'STV-be.drunk'. In the postposed
?akimpi clause in (10) there is no third person subject pronoun s— on the
verb 2aleken 'to be alive' in line e. This verb is a lexicalization of the
stative prefix 2al- and the verb leken'to stay; be seated; live'. The mainclause itself (second part of line d.) happens to be a nominalized clause, thus
it does not have subject marking either.

"This relative clause is postnominal; it follows its head NP the man. The
relativizer is who; it links the relative clause to its head NP. The head NP hasthe grammatical role of object in its main clause: it is the object of the verb
'caught'. The NPrel, or relative-clause co-referent of the head NP, has thegrammatical role of subject: it is the subject of the verb 'robbed'.
Relative clauses in Barbareho Chumash have the following features.
First, all relative clauses are postnominal. Second, they are linked to the head
noun via the dependent proclitic hi=. Exceptions are rare. Third, all of the
grammatical role positions available in Barbareho can be relativized. Thus
subjects, objects, and obliques--including possessors--can be relativized. Finally,
the grammar of relativization is sensitive to the distinction between core
argument NPrels and oblique NPrels. With rare exception, core-argument
NPrels, i.e. subjects and objects, always occur in nominalized relative clauses.",[118]

<then certainly I should surely be afraid of him.>This narrative opens in line a. with a neutral ‘if/fwhen' adverbial
clause. This lengthy adverbial clause does the global task of creating the
context for the rest of the situations that occur in the discourse. The
postposed conditional clause in line c., ‘if it is a spirit’, performs the localized
task of stating the condition under which main clause assertion 'I am not
afraid‘ is true. The difference between the global versus local role played by
the adverbial clauses in lines a. and c. is especially clear when they are
reversed:*If it is just a spirit, I am not afraid, whenever I hear what may be
somebody walking around inside the house,
Such a reversal yields an infelicitous result because the kinds of tasks that
these two clauses are doing are very different.
451In addition to the final conditional clause in line c., ‘if it is a spirit',this narrative has an initial conditional clause in line h., ‘only if is a bad
person'. This conditional clause is similar to the other initial conditional

infn
clauses discussed in 21.1.2,9 inin that

a contrast teuxrnth
with informationgiven in the previous context. In this case, the initial conditional clause
establishes a contrast between material given earlier in the narrative, i.e. 'I
am not afraid' (line b.) and material that comes last, in line i., 'certainly I
should be afraid’. The postposed conditional clause that occurs earlier in the
text, however, does not do such a discourse-level task. It serves only to qualify
the proposition expressed in its main clause.
21.2.2 Qualifying embedded main clauses
Sometimes a conditional clause has an embedded main clause. Such
conditional clauses are postposed in English (Ford & Thompson 1986) and in
Barbarehno Chumash. Thus if the main clause is a complement clause, the
postposed conditional clause will not come between it and the matrix verb. If
the main clause is relative clause, the postposed conditional clause again will
not intervene between it and the head noun that it qualifies. The motivation
for the positional order can be argued to be iconic, in that the elements most
closely relevant to each other are also the closest to each other. An illustration
is given in (23), which is an excerpt from the entire text given in example (1).
The apodosis in line d., 'or jerk loose from him ', is a conjoined complement
clause whose matrix verb is p-sa2?-alaqway 'you can' in line c. The
conditional clause 'if he grabs you quickly' is relegated to the final position
in tor jerk loose from him if he

All complement clauses follow the matrix verb. They are finite in that
they are inflected for person. Sometimes they are inflected for tense and
aspect. Forms of the complementizer may vary. In most cases, the dependent
proclitic hi= links the complement clause to its matrix verb. A less common
complementizer is Gu, which is historically related to the purposive adverbial
conjunction Gu ‘so that, in order to' and the general conjunction Gu ‘and;
but; such that'. Finally, in rare tokens, the complementizer is ka=. Below areexamples of complement-taking predicates together with their complement
clauses.
e Verbs of utterance
Verbs of utterance, such as 'say', 'tell', 'ask', etc., may or may nothave a complementizer in the complement clause. If there is a
complementizer, it is almost always the dependent clitic hi=, as in (292). In
rare instances it is ka=, as in (293).

2iyeme‘although; even if' Clauses10.0 IntroductionAdverbial clauses with the conjunction 2iyeme ‘though, although;
even if‘ are another adverbial clause type in my corpus. There are only 11
tokens of this type: 3 are preposed, 7 are postposed, and 1 occurs in medial
position.
The 2?iyeme conjunction appears to be derived from a particle * 2iye
(meaning uncertain) and the emphatic clitic he ‘just, merely’. The particle
* 2iye appears to be cognate with Ineseho 2iya'and; even', which is foundin the Ineseho adverbial conjunction 2iyapa ‘even if; even though'
(Applegate 1972a). Also, the 2iye- in ?iyemhe is doubtless the same
morpheme as the 2?iye- in the Barbareho conjunction 2iyena '(even) if',
discussed briefly in chapter 8. Adverbial clauses with 2 iyeme code concessive
relations and concessive conditional relations. These relations are discussed in
turn in sections 10.1 and 10.2. One of the ?iyeme clause tokens is
discontinuous--a situation whereby the adverbial conjunction is separated from
the rest of its clause by an intervening noun phrase or another adverbial
clause. This one token is discussed in 10.3. A summary is given in 10.4.
10.1 2iyeweclauses that code concessive relationsAll of the2iyemeadverbialclauseshavebeenfoundto codeaconcessive relation with a main clause, though a subset of these also code a
concessive conditional relation. As Givdén states (1990:835), a concessive
relation involves
'...a presupposed contrast or counter-expectancy, with the ADV-clause
supplying the grounds for the counter-expectation, and the main clause
supplying the less-likely event or state'.
For example, in the English sentence ' although he liked her, he stayed away '
(from Givén 1990:835), the concessive clause ' although he liked her' provides
the grounds for the counter-expectation supplied in the main clause 'he
stayed away'. In Barbareho Chumash, only the 2? iyeme adverbial clause type
has been found to code concessive relations.

<no matter how ugly he is / however ugly he is.>233Thompson and Longacre (1985:198-199) state that there are two kinds
of concessive adverbial clauses: definite and indefinite. Definite concessive
clauses have a concessive conjunction like English ""although ' or Barbareno
Chumash ?iyeme. The indefinite concessive clauses typically contain an
indefinite pronoun or question word, such as 'whoever', 'what', or 'how',
as in 'No matter what he said, she still refused to go out with him' or
""Whoever he is, ’m not opening the door’ (1985:199). The example in (2)
above illustrates both the qualities of definite and indefinite concessive
clauses: it has the conjunction ?iyeme, and at the same time it has the
indefinite question word 2akay ‘how much'. None of the Barbareho
Chumash concessive clauses were found to have indefinite elements without
the conjunction 2iyeme.
10.2 2iyeme clauses that code concessive conditional relationsSeveral tokens of the 2? iyeme clause type code a concessive conditional
relation. Concessive conditional clauses are often referred to as ‘even if'clauses (Thompsonand Longacre1985, Givén 1990), as in the Englishsentence ‘Even if it rains we'll have our picnic' (from Thompson and
Longacre 1985:196). Crosslinguistically, these clauses are similar to the regular
conditional clauses in a given language, but they carry a contrary-toexpectation presupposition not normally found in the ordinary conditional
clauses for that language (Thompson and Longacre 1985). In Barbareno
Chumash, a concessive conditional clause has the conjunction 2iyewhe
‘although, though; even if"". (Cf. however example (8) in chapter 8, where the
adverbial clause has the conjunction 2iyena ‘if’, which leans toward a
concessive conditional meaning.) Also, it may be followed by the conjunction
haku 'if' or na ‘if in the same adverbial clause. The main clause may have
markers of irrealis modality, such as the future prefix sa2-, that underscore
the hypothetical nature of the conditional relation. An example is given in (3).
The concessive conditional clause in line b. also happens to be in medial
position. It appears to be in a dependent relation with the main clause
preceding it and the main clause following it.

adverbial clause above in line b. has the conjunction 2?iyeme. Unlike the
other tokens, however, this token also has the adverbial conjunction haku
‘if'. This token satisfies the criteria of conditional relations in that: (i) the
adverbial clause states a hypothetical condition, ‘even if he is old', and (ii)
the main clauses (lines a. and c.) are marked by an irrealis operator, in this
case the future tense prefix sa?-. It is also noteworthy that the emphatic
proclitic me
and the emphatic suffix -2 accompany these concessive
conditional relations, as seen in the main clauses of (3) above. Such
morphosyntax underscores the contrary-to-expectation meaning in the
concessive conditional relation.
Concessive conditionals with ?iyeme
and na '‘if' are unlike
prototypical conditionals in the sense that the main clause does not have an
irrealis operator such as the future prefix sa?2?-. However, emphatic
connotations are seen in the relation just as in the concessive conditional
relation that has the conjunction haku 'if' in (3). For example in (4) there
is the intensive qualifier noho? ‘very, much' in the adverbial clause. There
is also a pragmatically-marked, preposed NP in the main clause of line b.","[253, 254, 255, 256, 257]"
"DP=ART=container2.3.4.3Cleft constructions
Barbareho Chumash has at least three structurally-distinct cleft
constructions. Payne (1997:278) defines a prototypical cleft construction as
follows:
QJEEUSTYe'... a type of predicate nominal consisting of a noun phrase (NP;)
and a relative clause whose relativized NP is coreferential with
NP;,. NP; is commonly referred to as the ""clefted constituent,""
and is normally found to the left of the rest of the clause,
though it may appear in other positions. '!
Though all three cleft constructions consist of an NP followed by a
nominalized clause, in only one of the cleft constructions does the nominalized
clause have the same form as typical, nominalized relative clauses in
Barbareno. I refer to these three kinds of clefts in the following way: i) true
clefts; ii) pseudo clefts; and iii) hi clefts. True clefts and pseudo clefts have
nominalized clauses that begin with the stative clitic ka=; hi clefts have
nominalized clauses that begin with the focus clitic hi= (not to be confused
with the dependent clitic hi=). These cleft constructions are illustrated in turn.
e True clefts
In true cleft constructions, the clefted NP either has the stative prefix2al-, as seen in (282) and (283) below, or it has the predicating particle
?akay (glossed 'cLeFrr'), as seen in (284). In both cases the clefted NP is
followed by a nominalized clause that has the stative proclitic ka=.

have the stative prefix 2a1-, nor is it preceded by the predicating particle
?akay. Also, pseudo clefts are much more frequent in the corpus than trueclefts. Two illustrations of a pseudo cleft are given in (285) and (286). (For

Crosslinguistically, we find that preposed and postposed adverbial
clauses may differ in morphosyntactic structure (Givén 1990). The differences
always point to the general tendency for postposed clauses, more so than
preposed clauses, to have a tighter semantic bond with their main clauses. For
the Barbareno Chumash language, differences in morphosyntactic patterning
are best examined in terms of two categories of adverbial clause types: (i)
those clause types that have both preposed and postposed tokens; and, (ii)
those clause types that have only postposed tokens, or an overwhelming
tendency toward postposed tokens. For the relevant clause types in group (ii),
the relationship between morphosyntactic patterning and bondedness with the
main clause was dealt with in part II of the dissertation. A brief recapitulation
of the findings will be given in 18.1. The clause types in group (i) will be the
focus of 18.2. A summary follows in 18.3
18.1 Clause types that are mostly postposedIn some of the clause types that are postposed there was a reduction
in pronominal subject marking. For the Gukanu 'so that, in order to' clause
type in chapter 12 and the one purposive ehu 'in order to' clause token in
chapter 15, the loss or retention of the subject pronoun was motivated by the
semantics of agency and control. The greater the control on the part of the
main clause subject (which was always an agent), the greater chance there was
that the adverbial clause would not have a subject pronoun. We saw that the
adverbial clause subject pronoun was retained, however, when the main clause
subject did not have full control over the situation coded by the adverbial
clause. The loss of subject marking in the adverbial clause could happen
whether the adverbial clause and main clause had same subjects or different
subjects. In other clause types that tend to be postposed, especially the kayké
""because ' reason clauses and the kaheé ' like, as if' manner clauses, we sawthat reduction in pronominal subject marking was found mainly in samesubject adverbial clauses. This pattern reflects the fact that final, same-subject
adverbial clauses tend to have a tighter semantic bond with their main clauses
than postposed, different-subject adverbial clauses.
365As noted above, postposed kaheé 'like, as if' clauses with the samesubject as the main clause were found to have a reduction in subject marking.
A couple of the postposed tokens in this clause type are also distinguished by
the fact that they have the dependent proclitic hi=, This is the
morphosyntactic feature that is commonly found in postposed tokens of those
adverbial clause types that are not limited to final position. A discussion and
illustration of the pattern that involves this important, distinguishing feature
is given next in 18.2.
18.2 Clause types that have preposed and postposed tokensFor most of the adverbial clause types that have both initial and final
tokens, the only morphosyntactic feature that distinguishes the two positions
is the presence or absence of the proclitic hi=. As we saw in chapter two, this
clitic codes a syntactically dependent relation between one element and
another. In adverbial clauses, it codes dependency on a main clause.
Specifically, it attaches to the postposed clause, but not to the preposed clause
of a given adverbial clause type. Exceptions are rare. Illustrations of this
important difference can be seen throughout part I of the dissertation in the
following adverbial clause types: 2akimpi ‘during; while', mali 'when',
haku ‘if', na ‘if; when', wa ‘if; when' and kaheé Hike, as if'. The
pattern is clearly seen in the comparisons given below in examples (1) through
(10). We will start with a pair of initial and final mali clauses that are
contrasted in (1) and (2).","[386, 387, 388]"
"398Chapter 20
Purpose Clauses20.0Introduction
.
A purposive adverbial clause names the goal (the ""purpose"") of the
agent in the corresponding main clause. Thus in the sentence 'Tim and Scott
plan to go to Oahu in January so that they can surf the gigantic waves ', the
purpose clause 'so that they can surf the gigantic waves' names the goal of
the main clause agents, Tim and Scott. From a perspective of language that
considers only sentences in isolation, the purpose clause could be preposed or
postposed without much consequence. That is, one could also say 'So that
they _can surf the gigantic waves, Tim and Scott plan to go to Oahu in
January' without there being any change in meaning.
In her groundbreaking study of thé functions of purpose clauses in
written English discourse, Thompson (1985) argued that initial and final
purpose clauses should be viewed as two different kinds of constructions,
rather than as a single construction that may occur in either initial or final
position. As Thompson noted, the problem is not to determine which
discourse factors affect the position that a purpose clause may take. Rather,
the problem is to find out what kinds of different discourse work are being
done by initial and final purpose clauses. As we will see in this chapter, the
kinds of work that initial and final purpose clauses do in Barbareno Chumash
narrative discourse mirror what Thompson found for initial and final purpose
clauses in several genres of written English:
',...the initial purpose clause helps to guide the attention
of the reader, by signalling, within the portion of the text
in which it occurs, how the reader is expected to associate
the material following the purpose clause with the material
preceding it. The final purpose clause does not play this
role.' (p. 61; emphasis in the original)
Final purpose clauses, on the other hand, function to state the goal or purpose
that is mainly relevant to the proposition in the immediately preceding clause
(Thompson 1985, Givén 1990). They have a limited, localized role within the
organization of a text.
399The fact that initial purpose clauses have a more global role is reflected
in the greater number of clauses that fall under their scope, as Thompson
(1985) found for Purpose clauses in English. Likewise in Barbareno Chumash,

Scopeofaalittleover6 successive clauses, yet final purpose clauses rarely have more than one
preceding clause within their scope.
Barbareno purpose clauses also share one other, fundamental
characteristic with the English purpose clauses in Thompson’s 1985 study: they
are used most frequently in final position.
Initial and final purpose clauses in English may have the same
conjunction (e.g. fo or in order to) and be totally identical in form. In
Barbareno the morphology is different. Initial purpose clauses take only the
conjunction na, which normally has the meaning ‘if' or 'when'. Final
purpose clauses never have na, but can have one of four other conjunctions:
éu or Gukanu, both meaning'so that, in order to', Ku 'so that..not..; lest’,or the conjunction mehu, normally found in reason relations with the meaning
‘because, since, from'.","[420, 421, 422]"

"512Chapter 23Semantically Neutral Clauses23.0 Introduction
Semantically neutral adverbial clauses code relations that can be seen
as having both a temporal and conditional meaning. Most researchers put
neutral clauses into the conditional category (e.g. Thompson (p.c.), Comrie
1986, ter Meulen 1986, Ford 1993, Hacker 1998). In their view, an adverbialclause such as that in ' When the sun is out, photosynthesis takes place’ (from
Ford 1993:23) codes a conditional relation. In this dissertation, however, such
clauses are treated as neutral rather than as conditional or temporal.
Thompson and Longacre (1985:193) mention that, under certain
circumstances, there is no distinction made between 'if'- and ‘when '-clauses
in certain Papuan languages, Indonesian and the African language Vai
(Mande language family). Other known languages that appear to show this
neutralization include German and Japanese. Thompson and Longacre (1985)
refertothislackofdistinctionbetween‘if'-and‘when'clausesas“neutralization”, hence I use the terms ""semantically neutral"" and “neutral” to
refer to adverbial clauses in which the conditional and temporal meanings are
conflated. One could also refer to these adverbial clauses as 'if/when' clauses.
In this chapter, as has been done throughout the dissertation, my free
translation for adverbial conjunctions in semantically neutral clauses is
‘iffwhen'.","[534, 535]"
