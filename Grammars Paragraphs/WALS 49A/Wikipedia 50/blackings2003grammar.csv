Suffixed subordinate verbs
In this chapter we look at verbs which have a low tone prefix and one of
five suffixes: kä, 1ε, re, fia, and djó.
These verbs are contained in subordinate clauses which can be
complement to a verb, or a modifier of a noun (ie. relative clause) or a
modifier of a missing noun (ie. headless relative). In this chapter we focus
on the internal structure of the clauses: the kinds of subject and object
they have. In chapter 16 we consider the roles played by these clauses as
arguments and modifiers.
In the glosses we use square brackets to mark the boundaries of the
subordinate clauses; this is an aid to the reader. In a few cases we are in
doubt about the placement of a boundary and in these cases we have not
indicated boundaries in the glosses. We gloss all suffixes as -SB. We
gloss the prefix as N-.

low tone which might be the same as this.
(a)It might be the low tone determiner, which makes a noun phrase
specific; in this case it perhaps makes the preceding clause
specific (in some sense). We think this is the best analysis.
(b) It might be the same low tone as is attached as a suffix to the
focused verb (and is possibly seen also in ni).
(c) It might be the low tone prefix seen on nonpast (and subordinate
suffixed) verbs, presumably attaching as a prefix in this case to ?1
which would thus be in some sense verb-like.
Or it might be a different morpheme from any of these. In glossing the
examples we have assumed that it is (a) the specific determiner.",[591]

"Evidence for the analysis in this sectionIn this section we have claimed that the nonverbal predicate always has a
pronominal subject. If the pronominal subject is third person, it is nonovert, and either a noun phrase is adjoined to it (in which case the
adjoined phrase takes on the role of subject), or no noun phrase is
adjoined (in which case the null pronominal is interpreted as expletive).
We now briefly review some evidence for this approach.
1. This approach offers a uniform account of arguments: now all
arguments are always pronominale, overt or null, whether subject of verb,
object of verb, or subject of nonverbal predicate.
2. We know that the full noun phrase at the beginning of a nonverbal
clause can be separated from the predicate by 1ε or ile \ When the noun
phrase is third person, the structure is as follows:
adjoined subject + ( 7 ) 1ε + non-overt pronominal subject + predicate
When the noun phrase is first or second person, the structure is as
follows:
adjoined subject + lie"" + overt pronominal subject + predicate
The fact that the pronominal must be repeated after lié suggests that this
is an obligatory position for a pronominal. Where it is apparently omitted,
as in the third person case, we might sugggest that there is still a
pronominal there, but that it is non-overt.",[252]
"Arguments: subject and objectIn this grammar we propose that all predicators, whether verbal or
nonverbal, have a pronominal subject and can in addition have what we
call an 'adjoined subject', which is optional and which we assume is
adjoined to the left of the pronominal 'true' subject, rather than being a
fundamental structural part of the sentence.

The adjoined subject can itself be a pronoun, in which case the sequence

call a 'long pronoun'.
A definite subject can be marked as plural by adding ki "" which
follows the subject and precedes the inflected verb (11), but follows the
uninflected verb (12).

"The subject as the patient of a transitive predicateA transitive verb characteristically assigns its subject the thematic role of
agent and its object the thematic role of patient. It is possible for the
subject instead to be assigned the patient thematic role. The effect is
similar to passive in English, though achieved by different syntactic
means.
5.3.1. Detransitivization (and hence subject interpreted as patient)
All transitive verbs characteristically have objects. If the object is not
realized explicitly as a noun phrase or pronoun, there are two optionsThe subject as the patient of a transitive predicate89depending on the verb. If the verb is uninflected or directive the object can
be covert, while if the transitive verb is inflected the object can only be
realized as ?a and cannot be omitted.

(b) 'She will certainly cook it.'

its subject must be interpreted as the patient rather than the agent.

Detransitivization is possible for some verbs and not others. Transitive
verbs for which detransitivization is possible include di 'cook' and emi
'boil'. Some verbs appear only in an intransitive form with a patient
subject; these include äka 'melt'. Transitive verbs for which this is not
possible and which therefore always have agent subjects include ρ à 'eat',
mvü 'drink' and djè 'wash'. Causative verbs with the i- prefix cannot be
detransitivized:90(82)VerbsirádìIkóbeerthisfinishra

"38Phonetics3.5.1.2. Contour tones: all arise by sandhi
There may be no underlying (phonemic) contour tones. High-Low tonal
sequences are found in some words.
kpo
sa""'all'
'time, clock, watch' (from arabic); also 'even'However, these may be interpreted not as contour tones but as involving
two syllables rather than one. Evidence for this is that the vowels in these
'contour' cases are always longer.
kpó.ò'all'In some cases, a High-Low sequence on a single lengthened vowel is a
variant of a word with a High Low sequence on two syllables:
(1)tebe—>te'earlier in the day'
(2)banba~'bar' (loanword from English)
(3)ma ?a—»ma'my'
The first two shortened forms occur freely for most speakers in both fast
speech and slow speech; the last only in fast speech.
There are no corresponding examples of Low-High contour sequences
on what appears to be a single syllable, with the possible exception of the
word máátfiká 'a sorghum species'.
In addition to these cases of contours which arise by internal voweldeletion rules there are contours which arise by external vowel-deletion
rules. Thus there are various grammatical morphemes which are realized
by a floating low tone, and these combine with a preceding high tone to
produce an apparent High-Low contour on a single lengthened vowel.

differentiated from analogous phrases by idiosyncratic meanings, and in
some cases by ATR harmonization (4.1.7).

postposition, but the postposition might possibly also be analyzed as a
noun in this case:

combination precedes the possessed thing; in the compound it follows. In
a phrase the possessor must be animate; this restriction does not hold in
the compound.

bare drû and an instrumental interpretation).
The drû phrase is best interpreted as having a predicate pre-adjoined to

pre-adjoined to drû it characterizes a set of entities which are analogous to
the entity represented by the noun phrase.

"6.6.2. Adverbials which resemble adjectives
Some adverbials are homophonous with adjectives. Thus for example the
adverbial losó 'well' is homophonous with the adjective losó 'good'. In
some cases the homophonous pairs are made of reduplicated members,
for example tfé tfé means both 'slowly' and 'slow'. This fits a general
pattern whereby adverbials tend to have a reduplicated structure. Some
adjectives exist in singular and plural forms, but the adverbs are
homophonous with the singular forms and do not pluralize.

6.1.2. Plural native nouns : characteristic tone, or suppletion
6.1.2.1. The distinctive tonal pattern of some native plural nouns
Most nouns do not have a distinctive plural form. The nouns which do are
primarily nouns of gender, age, kinship and occupation; these have
morphologically distinct plural forms with a characteristic tonal pattern,
and in some cases also a suffix. Other than these, it is rare for nouns to be
differentiated morphologically for number. Crazzarola (1960: 17) shows
that similarly in Logbara kinship terms are the only nouns which
pluralize, often with a plural suffix el, though Logbara has a regular plural
suffix for these words which Ma'di does not.",[114]
"Object of α directive verbáü can be used to focus the postverbal object of a directive verb. The ?Ί
strategy cannot be used in this case. The directive sentence takes on a
meaning of 'let her for the moment,' or 'let her concentrate on', 's/he is
better off doing', etc. The object can be explicit (78,79) or implicit (80).
When it takes an overt object, áü is used to suggest to a person that she
had better limit herself to the named activity rather than attempt whatever
else (which is unnamed) she intends to do.

"Possessive ?i as a postposition in relation to locational ?a?a has the syntax of a postposition, in that it can take a full noun phrase
complement. Furthermore ?a has the effect of raising the tone on a
preceding pronoun or deictic. This is an effect seen with postpositions,
which further justifies the identification of ?a as a postposition. As is
often the case with sequences of grammatical words, there is also the
potential for deletion of segments. This is seen when a pronoun is
followed by ?a. The glottal stop is deleted, and the final vowel of the
pronoun is deleted; tones remain. Thus for example 'your (singular)' is
not pi ?á but pá. The vowel of the combined pronoun + postposition
can itself be deleted along with the low tone: thus má ?à ëndrè is
realized as mendre 'my mother'.
The possessive postposition ?a might in principle be related to the
locative postposition ?a 'in' (parallel to the relation between possessive
dri and locational dri). The phonological difference between ?a and ?a
might possibly be a manifestation of the floating low determiner which
perhaps always following the postposition phrase when it expresses
possession, which by a regular phonological process would lower the mid
tone: ?a + "" —> ?a. The possibility that the specific LOW determiner
follows the word might explain why no other determiner can follow it. It
also recalls the possibility of having the low determiner suffixed to a
postposition phrase with dri (whose tone would not be affected).
However, there are three clear differences between ?a and ?a apart from
the tone, which somewhat militates against the possibility that one is
derived from the other. First, ?a is more widely used as a locational
postposition in Ugandan Ma'di than in Lokai, but ?a is not used as aPremodifiers 301possessional postposition at all. Second, locational ?a takes only an
inanimate complement; this is not true for possessional ?a. Third,
locational ?ä takes an indefinite complement, while possessive ?à takes a
definite complement. Finally we note that 'Burulo has ?a but does not
have the LOW specific determiner, which also somewhat militates against
our hypothetical derivation.","[316, 317]"

"56Phonology and morphology4.2.3. Possessive pronoun before vowel-initial noun
A 'possessive pronoun' is a combination of an object pronoun followed
by ?a. The glottal is lost, even in deliberate speech. If the noun begins
with a vowel carrying a mid or low tone, the final [à] in the possessive
pronoun is lost, and the other vowel in the pronoun assimilates to the
initial vowel of the noun.

heard, which can give the impression that an indefinite noun can take m in
subject position. However, since ni is used only after nouns which end in
low tones, this suggests that in these cases the determiner is also present.

There is apparent optionality when the noun phrase contains a
demonstrative or the determiner n. In these cases, ni is sometimes used
and sometimes not. However, we argue in 12.10.1 that this optionality is
only apparent and that in these phrases the presence of ni is a result of the
syntactic presence of a phonologically concealed LOW determiner.
We propose that ni and pi are pronominale and the noun phrase is preadjoined to them. This is the same as our analysis of ?i, and resembles the
relation between the adjoined subject and the true pronominal subject of a
verb. We suggest that ni might possibly be related to the 'default' (NS
paradigm) third person singular pronoun äni (6.4.3). We note that ?i264Noun phrasessimilarly resembles the (NS paradigm) third person plural pronoun à?ì

'grammatical ni' is unable to follow an indefinite noun phrase. In
contrast, possessive ni can only follow an indefinite. We suggest that the
two kinds of ni are different words, accidental homophones.

grammatical ni is a variant of the pronoun âni). First, it would mean that,
like the dn strategy and probably the ?a strategy, this is another example
of a postpositional strategy for possession. Second, the tonal difference
between the possessional ni and the postposition ni is parallel to the tonal
difference between the possessional ?a and the postposition ?a; in both
cases, a tone is lowered one step to get possession. Third, the Logbara
cognate is actually a high tone ni (homophonous in Logbara with the
postposition ni); Crazzarola does not treat them as the same (1960: 141).",[311]

nouns can also double as titles with a specific definite interpretation which
makes them name-like; làpwópi 'teacher' is like this in that it can mean 'a

"A possible case of a noun phrase subject in a re clauseThere is one situation in which a suffixed clause can have a noun phrase

somewhat object-like.

There are two possible explanations. One is that the subordinate clause is
treated as the noun phrase because Jtá-clauses do show noun phrase like
characteristics, and is followed by na as the determiner. Another
possibility is that nä expresses an argument within the subordinate clause.
We have no analysis of this at present.
Some light is possibly cast on this by comparison with Ugandan
Ma'di. nain Ugandan Madi differs from na in Lokai Ma'di in two ways:
(a) it can lose [n], (b) it must be followed by ni. This is the case both for
the determiner nä (preceded by a noun) and for the nä we see here; this
strongly suggests that it is the same morpheme in both cases.

"6Introduction1.6.1. Orthography
A standard orthography was adopted following the recommendations of
the Rejaf Language Conference of 1928. The policy then was to admit
representative languages to be taught in schools. From the Eastern
Sudanic languages were chosen Zande, Mora, Ma'di, Kreish and Ndogo
(Tucker 1940:36). The rest of the languages were left to die. Government
textbooks were supposed to be issued in these languages to be used in the
schools. Subsequently Sir James Robertson, who succeded Sir Douglas
Newbold as the Civil Secretary, reversed in 1946 the policy of his
predecessor which hitherto regarded South Sudan as a different social
and political entity from Northern Sudan. This reversal saw the last
governmental attempt to develop orthographies for the languages of the
South Sudan, as the North has been hostile to them and has preferred the
promotion of Arabic. From around 1987 The Summer Institute of
Linguistics (SIL) started work on the orthography of the language
culminating in the production of a primer in 1992; SIL member Kilpatrick
(1985) also has suggestions for an orthography.
The standard orthography for Ma'di omits tones and uses the five
vowels (a, e, i, o, u), thus ignoring ATR distinctions in the vowels. The
SEL suggestion for ATR differentiation is to place a dot below a vowel (a
e i o or u) to mark it as +ATR; without a dot the vowel is -ATR.
Kilpatrick suggests as an alternative placing a colon before the word with
+ATR vowels. In this grammar, following Lojenga 1994, we use different
symbols for +ATR vowels (λ e i o u) and -ATR (a ε i ο υ) vowels. This
is our only deviation from the IPA symbols we otherwise use, and we do
this for visual clarity.
For the tones, the SIL practice is as follows: Low vowels are marked
with a tilde over the vowel, high vowels with an acute accent, and mid
vowels are not marked with a diacritic. Kilpatrick suggests additionally
marking mid vowels with a circumflex or umlaut. In this grammar we
mark low vowels with a grave accent (à), mid vowels with a macron (ä),
and high vowels with an acute accent (á).
Glottal stops are indicated in the standard orthography by an
apostrophe, as in 'a for ?a 'stomach'. Implosive ('preglottalized')
consonants are marked in the standard orthography by putting an
apostrophe before the consonant, as 'ba, for fia 'to put; home'. Hence
the language name màdi is written Ma'di. The palatal nasal [p] is written
ny, hence pä is written nya. These orthographic practices are adopted also
by the SIL. We use IPA symbols for all consonants in this grammar.","[21, 22]"

"The name of the language and of the peopleThe speakers refer to themselves and are known to others as the màdl In
standard orthography this is Ma'di; the apostrophe indicates that d is
implosive. The speakers refer to their language as màdi ti, literally
'Ma'di mouth'. Among themselves, Ma'dis refer to each other as
belonging to this or that súnι 'clan' or 'tribe', which may further be
broken down into pä 'the descendants of which in some cases overlap
with sum. While a Ma'di can only marry from outside the clan, this is
normally within the group of people who speak Ma'di as the common
language.
1.1.1. Other peoples and languages sometimes called 'Ma 'di '
'Ma'di' has also been used to describe other peoples and other
languages in the area. Thus for example a common tendency especially in
the Acholi area of northern Uganda is to refer to anyone from West Nile
Region as a Ma'di, even the Kakwa; the only group in this region who
are never called Ma'di are the Alur. Tucker (1940: 5) describes the
Kaliko ""who occupy the high plateau in the southern Yei River District
under Chief Aluma"" (in Sudan on the West side of the Nile, near the
Logbara) as having the ""real name Ma'di"". We are not sure of the basis
for Tucker's claim: these people are and still regard themselves as Kaliko
rather than as Ma'di. Fr. Crazzolara (1960: v) also makes a similar claim
about the Logbara when he says ""all Logbara, however, agree that they
are of the Ma'di nation, that they are Ma'di. They are called Ma'di by the
Aluur of Okooro, their immediate neighbours, in Bunyoro and
Buganda."" Again, we are not sure of the truth of this claim, at least at the
present time. Another group which is a possible source of confusion is
the Ma'di-Indri (midi ìndrì literally 'goat Ma'di') of Rhino Camp, Arua
District, Uganda; they are at times called Ma'di Okolo. Their other
neighbours, the Nilotic Alur, refer to them as Ma'di-Dyel (literally 'Goat
Ma'di') and the Bantu, Banyoro call them Abatembuzi (literally 'Goat2Introductionpeople'). Despite the name similarity, the group are administratively in
Arua District of the Logbara people rather than Moyo or Adjumani
Districts of the Ma'di people and speak a language which more closely
resembles Logbara than Ma'di. We note that Tucker and Bryan (1966:
36) suggest that ma- is a 'tribal prefix' used in some languages in the
region to name either the 'tribe' itself (mangbetu, meje, mamvu, ma'dì)
or another 'tribe' (e.g. the Mamvu word ma-zande 'a Zande').
1.1.2. Folk etymologies for the term 'Ma'di'
One jocular folk etymology among the Ma'di for their name is as
follows. When the first white person in the area asked the question 'who
are you?', the bemused response was midi 'a person' (phonetically
mÀcfî). This was taken to be the name of the people, which came to be
corrupted to the present word mádí (with -ATR vowels).
Another jocular Ma'di narrative attempts to account for the names of
some of the Moru-Ma'di group members, as follows. When the
progenitors of the Ma'di were pushed southwards, on reaching a strategic
location they declared Stri rù muró 'let's form a cluster here'. And so
they formed a cluster to defend themselves. This group came to be known
as the Moru. A group broke off in search of greener pastures in a more or
less famished state, until they found an edible tree called lugbá 'desert
dates' (ximenia aegyptiaca ). After helping themselves to this manna, they
could not resist the temptation of taking some with them. When the time
came to refill their stomachs again, a woman who lost her harvest was
heard enquiring about the lugbá η 'the desert dates'. This group came to
be known as Jugbârà but the Ma'di still call them lugbàrì. The final
group on reaching fertile grounds resolved and declared ma d'i 'here I am
(finally)'. And these came to be known as the Ma'di.","[17, 18]"

thisThe head noun (the modified noun) may be omitted in all cases where
there is postmodification. The presence or absence of the head noun does
not affect the interpretation or the syntactic distribution of the noun
phrase.",[319]
"4.5.4. Reduplication
There are many situations in Ma'di sentences where a word is
immediately followed by its copy. It is not immediately obvious in many
cases whether the pair of words should be considered as a single word,
derived by a lexical process of reduplication, or as a pair of words, each of
which is a syntactically distinct item.
The clearest case where copying involves two distinct syntactic
constituents is in verb focus, where a verb is copied and the copy placed
in final position followed by a low tone, as a way of focusing the verb.
The verb and its copy need not be adjacent, which shows that they do not
combine as a single word (19.12.1). Another fairly clearly syntactic kind
of reduplication involves reduplication of a final constituent since this can
be a phrase (eg. a postposition phrase); this is presumably a syntacticThe general morphology of Ma 'di words67process; it gives a meaning of regularity, repetition or immediacy (18.2.5).
More clearly lexical kinds of reduplication involve adjectives and
nouns. Reduplication of an adjective gives a meaning analogous to
English -er or -ish. Thus we find ali 'short', and àiiàii 'shorter' or
'shortish, rather short'. The reduplicated adjective can then be
nominalized, for example as allai! 'a series of shortnesses' with the
characteristic tone of abstract nouns. Nouns may also be reduplicated
with a meaning similar to that of reduplicated adjectives; these
reduplicated nouns might in fact be categorially adjectives (or sentential
modifiers). Thus màdi 'person' is reduplicated as màdi màdi to mean
'like a person; in the manner typical of a person'.
Some adjectives or sentential modifiers change meanings in
unpredictable ways when reduplicated. Pairs include mgbë 'immediately'
and mgbë mgbë 'recently'; ëzè 'a long time ago' and ëzè εζε, 'quickly,
hurriedly'; Bo 'intact' and Bo Bo (dru) 'temporarily'; tfirì or tfírí 'silent'
tßtßn 'silently'.
Some reduplicated words have no unreduplicated base; this is true for
example of pélópéló 'house pole', where there is no *péló. Similarly
some words expressing manner exist in reduplicated forms where the
non-reduplicated morpheme does not exist as an isolated word. They
include: π π 'hurriedly' but *n; and t/e tfé 'slowly' but *f/e; and re ré
'immediately, as soon as' but *re.
4.5.5. Tonal morphology
Word classes are differentiated to some extent by distinctive tonal
patterns, and words can be derived by changing the tonal pattern. There
are tonal prefixes such as the prefix which derives non-past and
embedded verbs, and various 'floating' tones which can attach to the
beginning or the end of a word in a syntactic context. Loanwords tend to
have a distinctive tonal pattern, both in the singular and in the plural.
4.5.6. The distinctive phonology and morphology of loanwords
4.5.6.1. Sources of loanwords
Loanwords in the Ma'di lexicon come from a variety of languages.
Arabic is a significant influence, particularly in Sudan, with Arabic words
perhaps filtered through Juba Arabic, the lingua franca of the south.
Acholi is a source of loanwords, as is Swahili. English is a major source
of loanwords, and loanwords also come from Italian, because of the
influence of Italian missionaries in the area. Sometimes Sudanese and68Phonology and morphologyUgandan Ma'di have similar loanwords which differ in whether they have
been borrowed directly from English into Ugandan Ma'di, or indirectly
from English via Juba Arabic into Sudanese Ma'di. Thus Ugandan
Ma'di telèfoni 'telephone' is a direct borrowing from English, while
Sudanese Ma'di téle funi may have been borrowed via Juba Arabic
tèlèfùùn ; similarly Ugandan Ma'di páñmeni
'parliament' from English
and Sudanese Ma'di báñmeni from Juba Arabic bàlìméèn.
4.5.6.2. Tone in loanwords
As discussed in 3.5.2, loanwords tend to have distinctive tonal patterns. It
may be that the high tone mimics a stress perceived on the source word;
we note that the tonal patterns mimic also the stress patterns (and possibly
the tonal patterns) found in Juba Arabic. Thus bisyllables have a HL
tonal pattern if and only if they are loanwords. Loanword nouns or
adjectives of three or more syllables tend also to have a falling tonal
pattern (ending in HL or HML), though here there are few native words to
compare them with, so this could just be a long word pattern. Plural
loanwords also have distinctive tonal patterns, as well as a distinctive
plural suffix -a (6.1.4). We note that Ngiti appears to show similarities,
with loanwords with a LML pattern, taking on a LHH pattern in the plural,
as described by Lojenga (1994: 135).
4.5.6.3. Epenthesis in loanwords
Vowels are inserted in loanwords to ensure the right syllable structure
such that there are no consonant clusters, and no final consonants.
Factoring out harmony, of the five vowels, all except [e] are used as
epenthetic vowels in loanwords. There does not appear to be any fully
systematic pattern, but there are some tendencies towards a matching for
height, with high root vowels [i] and [u] attracting [i] or [u] as epenthetic
vowels, and other vowels attracting [o] and [a]. The most common final
epenthetic vowel is [i], as in tód^ári 'business' from Juba Arabic tud^ar,
or ìqgìiisì 'English' or pagani from pagan·, [i] also breaks up a consonant
cluster in susltà 'zip' from Juba Arabic susta, [u] is found as a final
epenthetic vowel in gàlamù 'pen' and breaks up a consonant cluster in
rúküsá 'permit' from Juba Arabic ruksa, and ógùnà 'syringe' from Juba
Arabic ugna, [o] is a final vowel in kópólò 'corporal' and fàìrò 'file',
and breaks up a consonant cluster in sókósì, from English socks, [a] is a
final vowel in lamba from lamp, and màkànlkà from mechanic,
and
breaks up a consonant cluster in idàfârà 'eleven', from Juba Arabic
idashra.","[82, 83, 84]"
"There are some possible examples of cognate object structures in which
the object is attached to the postposition si (15.3.1.1).
5.2.1.1. The characteristics of the cognate object
Cognate objects are syntactically indefinite noun phrases, and may
precede or follow the verb, like any object. Like other objects, a final
cognate object is interpretable as in focus when sentence-final. The
cognate object can be put in subject position, in which case there is also
an object clitic. Note that, very unusually, there is no subject pronominal,
despite the fact that such a pronominal is normally required in all
sentences.

"FOCThis does not however prove that the adverbial is a noun; it could be the
final part of a very stripped-down relative clause and thus not directly
related to the definite article.
Other adverbials such as oßu 'tomorrow' can be attached to the
pronominal rìì or to determiners, which are both characteristics of nouns.
However, in the former case, attachment to ni would suggest that oßu is
being treated as a name (not as a common noun), as names attach to nl
and common nouns do not; this fits with the sense that oßu is being
personified.
(99)Ò6Ómò-nìrütomorrowPR3-knowREFL NEG(N)kü'Nobody knows tomorrow.' (perhaps with some

oßu can also take the specificity (floating low tone) determiner (and is
then followed, as expected for this determiner, by ni). It is less easy here
to see what the syntax of the phrase is; the specificity determiner does not
normally take preceding modifiers and normally combines only with a
preceding common noun, which suggests that there is indeed something
noun-like about oßu.
