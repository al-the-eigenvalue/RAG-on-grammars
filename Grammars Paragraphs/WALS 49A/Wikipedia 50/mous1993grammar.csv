A noun can be modified by a demonstrative, possessive, or indefinite suffix.
demonstrative suffixes distinguish four degrees of proximity. The possessive
distinguish person and number, but not gender, of the possessor. Indefinite s
differ according to the gender of the noun.

INDEF.F
INDEF.NNouns that are modified by another noun, an adjective or a relative clause are in the
con struct case. Noun phrases can be followed by adverbial case clitics. These clitics can
be suffixed to the noun. The adverbial case clitics include: direction towards (directivecase) and away from the noun (ablative); relations such as instrumental and reason.
Noun phrases that are to be taken as a unit are in the background case. C ase clitics
can follow demonstrative, possessive, and indefinite suffixes. The vocative case consists
of high tone on the penultimate syllable. The case suffixes do not form a regular case
s ystem because subject and object are not distinguished in case.
aHigh tone-i
-wa
-ar
-sa
-o or -heeeIn cab eema 'novelty' the vowel in caben is deleted due to the syllable red
rule ( 4) in 2.3. and n is deleted in front of the nasal m. The noun niina
'whiteness' is based on the irregular plural form of the adjective, niinakw.
Not all adjective to noun derivation is with this suffix because we have b o
'darkness' and b o ocaay (m) 'crowd' form booc 'black', uraay (m) 'size' from ur
This suffix is also used to derive a noun from a verb, at least for one example.

INSTR (instrumental)
REASON
BACK (background)At first sight, one may be tempted to analyse the high tone as a separate morpheme
indicating definiteness or individuality. The definite suffixes, i.e. the demonstrative
and possessive suffixes, have a high tone, as does the construct case suffix. Personal
pronouns all have a final high tone. Making the last syllable of a noun high is a device
to derive names from nouns; see 3. 7. But it is impossible to analyse high tone as a
separate marker because it does not have a single meaning. The high tone does not
indicate definiteness because indefinite nouns that are modified by an adjective are
in construct case and thus high. The high tone does not indicate specificity because
the indefinite specific suffix has a low tone. The high tone does not indicate that the
noun is modified, for the same reason. The fact that demonstratives and possessives
all have a final high tone is probably due to paradigmatic levelling. Or maybe these
high tone suffixes originate from constructions with the noun in the construct case and
a demonstrative or possessive pronoun as modifier. But in that case one would expect
high tone on the indefinite suffixes, too.
Demonstrative, possessive and indefinite suffixes have corresponding independent pro­
nouns. The pronouns consist of ku if referring to masculine and neuter words and
ta if referring to fe inine words, followed by the suffix in question;
see 3.5.2. These
rp
pronouns are used if the noun is already mentioned or when adding a demonstrative .
to a noun that already has a possessive suffix.
anoun suffixes are in most cases preceded by a linker which agrees in gender with ,8584
the noun. The gender linker for neuter nouns is -a for nouns in the construct
but otherwise neuter nouns have no gender linker. Thus the order of modifying
suffixes is:
POSS
DEM
[Noun root - number sfx] L INDEF - CASE
--And the gender linkers are:
( 9) Gender linkers
M M1 F F1 N
-u -ku -r -ta - or -a
On the basis of agreement in the linker one can distinguish five gender classes. I
to treat (m1) and (fl) as subclasses of (m) and (f) for the following reasons.
agreement in other parts of the grammar distinguishes only three classes, wit
distinction between (m) and (m1) , or between (f) and (fl ). This is the case with
independen t nominal modifiers, and in the verbal system. Secondly, number
have inherent gender, but none of them is (m1) or (fl) . Thirdly, the form
linker for (m1 ) is identical to the form of the agreement with (m) and (m1 )
independent demonstrat ive and possessive pronouns, and the same holds for (fl).
The subclasses of ( m1 ) Q.nd ( f1) nouns represent earlier stages of a historical
opmen t, ku > w and ta > r, possibly after developing from independent
suffixes. In Alagwa k and t are used as gender linkers for one demonstrat ive suffix,
w and r for another. The (m1) and (fl) nouns hav� resisted this historical develop

There are no semantic or phonological characterist ics to distinguish between (m)

The case clitic indicates that somewhere in the sentence there is a noun phrase
has the role expressed by the case. This does not need to be the noun phrase
which the case is cliticised. For example, in the following sentence the poison is
into the beer and yet 'poison' and not 'beer' has the directive case clitic, because
noun for 'poison' is in the core of the sentence, and 'beer' is external, which in i
reflects the sequence of the action: you take the beer first and then put poison

Furthermore, locatives can immediately foll.0w the verb. Then the dependent form of
'to be' is used. The locative noun phrase is an essential part of the act of the verb, it
immediately follows it, whereas if the locative noun phrase is circumstantial, it requires
background suffix. In the following sentences, the locative noun phrases immediately
follow the verb since the locative expressions are an essential part of the action.

Case clitics are preverbal markers and are attached to the preceding word. Only if
there is no noun between 'to be' and the verb will they be suffixed to BE. Often the
object nmm phrase is between the two. If the ob.ject is not a full noun (phrase) , it
is represented by an object pronoun. Thus the case suffixes are normally suffixe? .to
object pronouns. In object relative clauses, which have no object pronouns, case chtlcs
can be suffixed to BE without an object pronoun . Since the case clitics are independent
of the verb 'to be', they can combine with everything. What is excluded, however, are
sequences that have a different function as an aspect marker. Hence the directive case
suffix i cannot combine with the perfect tense suffix -a, because it would clash with
the consecutive aspect suffix -ay; and the ablative case clitic wa cannot be suffixed to
'to be' because this in turn would clash with the background aspect marker -wa. The
ablati�e case suffix wa is, however, possible with an object pronoun preceded by the

suffixes, indefinite and case suffixes, but not by possessive suffixes. Names are masculine
or feminine in gender according to whether they refer to a male or a female person. If
proper nouns are modified by a relative clause, they take a demonstrative suffix, like
personal (pro )nouns.

The directive, instrumental; and reason clitics, but not the ablative clitic - have

modified noun, or to the bare noun. Only if these case suffixe� are attached to

7.2. 1 . The subject
The subject is obligatorily expressed on the verb. The referent of the subject can
understood.
<aa<aam-iin8.3 cry-DUR:3.SG.F
'They (i.e. the birds (f)) are singing.'pers onal (pro )nouns are mostly used for people or personified animals in stories, and

sentences in elicitation, but I never encountered it in spontaneous speech such as stories.

The personal noun is rather used for contrast, not just for any known subject. In the
story about the hare and the leopard, these two main characters are both masculine
nouns. As long as there is no change in subject, the subject is only marked on the
verb. The personal noun inos or is 's/he' is used whenever the other becomes subject.

For third person subjects, the verb distinguishes between masculine, feminine, and
neuter subjects, identifying the subject by gender. Third person personal nouns have
only two forms: singular and plural. The distinction between male and female singular
subjects is only made on the verb.

The impersonal subject has t a as verb 'to be' and the third person singular masculine
ending on the verb. The impersonal subject has to be human, or, in a story, a per­
sonified animal. The third person plural personal noun, ino>in 'they' is used with an
impersonal subject. The impersonal subject is always understood as a group of people;

The first suffix that is attached to the noun must be preceded by a linker suffix agree­
ing in gender with the noun; see 3.4. A noun can have two modifying suffixes at a
time. Instead of the second modifying suffix, an independent pronoun can be used. A
demonstrative and an indefinite suffix/pronoun exclude each other because the mean­
ings cannot be combined. A possessive must precede a demonstrative or indefinite
marker.

3.5. Pronouns
3.5. 1. Personal pronouns
The personal pronouns have full and short forms. The short forms are used ·
speech. The pronouns all have high tone. Gender is distinguished in the second
singular only. The second person pronouns resemble each other. The second
singular masculine pronoun and the feminine form differ only in the vowel; the
culine form contain s an u which is also the 2.SG.M object pronoun and the
form contain s an i, the 2.SG.F . object agreement pronou n. The 2.PL pronoun is
on the 2.SG.M pronoun followed by the plural marker a'. There is no form kiin
The 3 .PL pronoun has the 3.SG pronoun in it, except for the final s, which is

The form of the suffix after neuter nouns seems to consist of a feminine stem ka
followed by the gender linker r and the ending -iya> which is used for verbs with a
neuter subject.
The suffixes are often used in the opening paragraphs of a story, e.g.

'The suffixes are also used for introducing an important character or the clue of the9594dakw ( +- dawa-ku ) 'hand of'story. For stylistic purposes the name of the character or the clue is postponed,
example in the story of Aama Ermii:

'Why are you afraid of this one; we are afraid of a certain other one ( t

3.4.4. The construct case suffix
Nouns that are followed by a modifier are in the construct case. The construct
suffix is not preceded by a gender linker but agrees in gender with the noun. The
has a high tone. The segmental form of the suffix is similar to the gender linker,
for the a for neuter nouns.

The case clitics are suffixed to forms with an object pronoun because the noun can
only be absent if its referent is understood or if it is at the beginning of the sentence,
and in both cases an object pronoun is obligatory (however; see below) . For example,
i is ambiguous, that is, it can be either a third person subject or a first person singular
object. In the following sentence, however, because of the case clitic, the only possible
interpretation is that of first person singular object.

Tense and mood are also marked on the verb 'to be' which precedes the main verb as
was shown in chapter 4.1. Aspect is marked both on the verb 'to be' and on the main
verb by derivational affixes, such as the durative suffix -m. The derivational suffixes
are discussed in 4.3. The only tense distinction on the verb is present tense ( including
versus past tense. Explicit future tense is expressed by the use of the verb 'to
future)
.
go\ Word �rder is also a factor in distingv.ishing present versus future tense;. see 7.3. � .
There is a distinction between indicative and subjunctive mood on the mam verb
present tense. In the past tense there is no mood distinction. The paradigm of the
verb distinguishes between first person sirtgular, second person singular, third person
singular masculine, third person singular feminine, first person plural, second person
plural, and third person plural. The verb form for the third person singular feminine
is identical with the second person singular, although the distinction is maintained in
the preceding verb 'to be'. The third person plural has two forms, with no difference
in meaning. The various forms for person, number and gender are exemplified in the
verb doohl 'to cultivate' in the present indicative in the following table.

With the impersonal ta there is no subject agreement on the verb. The verb is in its
base form , only inflected for tense, that is low tone for present tense and high tone
for past tense. These are the forms used with the third person singular masculine
subject. In fact the impersonal ta indicates that there is no subject, and that there is
the
no sub ject agreement on the verb. Therefore the impersonal ta is used whenever

"•The traditional Iraqw god is the sun god loo'a, who created all things and is om­
nipresent. No sacrifices are made to loo)a, but only prayers are addressed to the god,
whose force or power can be evoked by an oath or a curse, both referred to as cuuhla.
A variety of evil forces, termed netlangw, are said to reside in water and on mountain
tops, and sacrifices are made to ,counteratt these forces. , Spirits of deceased family
members, gi>i , must be attended to, for example by leaving out meat which
they can
.
eat when they return to the living in the body of a hyena.
There is both male and female circumcision in Iraqw society, and in former times there
was, for girls, a period of seclusion called marmo. This is no longer the case.
1 .2. The Iraqw language.
1 .2.1. Classification.
Iraqw is a Cushitic language, which is a branch of the Afro-Asiatic language family.
This classification was first claimed by Reinisch on the basis of material collected by
Baumann (1894). Reinisch classified Gorowa, Iraqw, Alagwa and Burunge as belonging
to the Hamitic group. Later, in 1906, Meinhof classified Burunge and Ma'a as Hamitic
and among others on the basis of lexical correspondences, showed that these language
were related to Somali. Tucker and Bryan (1957, 1 966) , on the other hand, ignoring
the arguments for their inclusion in Afro-Asiatic by earlier authors, claimed that Iraqw,
Gorowa, Burunge, and Alagwa were unclassified, and postulated an isolated language
group, the Iraqw group. Whiteley also took this position. Greenberg (1963) classified
the four languages as Southern Cushitic, one of the branches of Cushitic, of the Afro­
f\sia tic family, and this classification is now no longer challenged.
The Southern Cushitic languages consist of Iraqw, Gorowa (or Fiome), Alagwa (or
Asi), Burunge, Kw'adza (or Ng'omvia), Aasax (or Aramanik), Ma'a (or Mbugu) and
.Dahalo (or Sanye) . Ehret ( 1980) showed that these languages form a unit, and he5
4
arrived at the following subclassification:
West Rift: Gorowa and Iraqw
Rift:
Alagwa and Burunge
East Rift: Kw'adza and Aasax
Ma'a
Dahalo
Of these, K w'adza and Aasax are extinct or nearly extinct. The classification of Ma'
as a Cushitic language is disputed for theoretical reasons, namely because Ma'a is
mixed language with Bantu morphology and Cushitic roots. Likewise, the inclusion
of Dahalo in Southern Cushitic is disputed, and some scholars believe that it may be
Eastern Cushi tic.
aThe position of Southern Cushitic within the Cushitic family is unclear. Greenberg
( 1963) classifies it as one of the parallel groups of Cushitic, a classification which Ehret
( 1980) took at point value as being a valid one. However, Hetzron ( 1 980) argues, on
morphological grounds, for an inclusion of Southern Cushitic in Eastern Cushitic.
1 .2.2. The status of Iraqw today.
There is no dialect variation of any significance within the Iraqw area, which is probably
due to the high mobility of the Iraqw within their own territory. Iraqw is used for verbal
communication only. Reading and writing, education and all administrative matters
are carried out in Swahili. Hence, for more modern concepts Swahili loans are used .
The Lutheran Church makes use of Iraqw, whereas the Catholic Church which formerly
used. Iraqw, now uses Swahili. Despite these factors, there is no indication that the
language is threatened or will disappear.
1 .2.3. Former studies on Iraqw.
Study on the Iraqw language began at the end of the last century with the publication
of a word list and first notes on the language by Baumann ( 1894), in an account
of his expedition to the area. Six years later in 1900, Seidel published some notes,
that is, a short text and some words, on Gorowa, based on material collected by two
German colonial officers, Kannenberg and Glauning. In 191 1 , Struck published a table
of phonemes using material collected by Jaeger. In 1 913-14, Dempwolff produced a list
of 279 words. The first grammar of Iraqw was written by two Dutch White Fathers,
Schregel and Verhoeven, (Verhoeven 1 926), who had worked on the language for several
years. Unfortunately the 231 page manuscript was never published, and hence was
never used by others. I had access to a copy of the manuscript. Likewise, Berger,
a German linguist, worked on Iraqw, and although he collected a lot of material, he
only published a very short article on it (Berger, 1 938). At present, Berger's material
is being prepared for publication by Roland Kiessling in Hamburg. Leatherman and
Guthrie also had material on the language, that was used by Tucker and Bryan for a
synopsis (Tucker and Bryan, 1966). Whiteley published his first findings on Iraqw in
1953 , and later in a revised and enlarged version in 1 958, which for years has remained
the main source of _information on Iraqw. The anthropologist Wada published a more
substantial word list of Iraqw in 1 973, and followed this in 1976 with a huge collection
of stories, in Iraqw and Swahili. Unfortu.nately, however, his work is not very reliablein the markin g of tone, vowel length, glottal stop and 'ayn. In 1 988, Nordbustad
p ublished the most comprehensive Iraqw grammar to date. There she presented her
material which was acurate, in a well-organized way, although it falls short on analysis.
Art icles on various aspects of the Iraqw language have been published by Bradfield
( 1 977 ) , Dalgish (1978), Maghway ( 1983, 1 989), Elderkin (1988) and Kiessling ( 1 989,
1 990). Qorro ( 1 982) , Kiessling ( 1 988), and Pflug (1989) have written their M.A. theses
on Iraqw.
1.2. 4. Publications in Iraqw.
There are a few publications in Iraqw itself, see the bibliography. Most of these pub­
lications are religious works. Between 1 920 and 1 926, the Catholic mission published
several religious books, their main work being aymar slafing ar mungu nee xoororos
which contains parts of the Old and New Testament. From 1 957 to date the Lutheran
mission has contributed to Iraqw literacy and in 1977 they published the New Testa­
ment, Yajabt6r hho , in Iraqw. In the late colonial period, there was a local official
newspaper called IRGOBAWE also with contributions in Iraqw (see Maghway, 1 989),
although I myself have never seen a copy of it. In 1 978, Nordbustad published some
Iraqw oral literature. In addition, Wada ( 1973) published a collection of Iraqw stories
in Iraqw and Swahili.
1 .2.5. Collection of data.
My fieldwork was carried out during three periods: June-October 1 987, June and
July 1988, and January-August 1 989. I conducted most of the research in Kwermusl,
in Irqwa dacaw, the central Iraqw area, where I stayed with the family of Efraim
Neema. My main informants were Bless Hilu, the headmaster of K wermusl primary
school, and John Qamlali from Gehandu, near Mbulu. I elicited sentences from the
latter two using English and Swahili as intermediate languages. John Dafay from
Haylotto helped me to transcribe the stories that I collected from Hhawu Tarmo and
Maria Sanka in Haylotto. In 1 990, I worked with Jerry Kirway and Joan Mrutu, while
they were in The Hague for a course of study. In July 199 1 , I spent two weeks in Mbulu
to clarify some problematic points in my data. Apart from some 1 800 elicited sentences,
I have 21 stories, 3 poetic contests ( girayda), 7 versions of a poetic prayer ( hlufay),
34 songs (da>angw) , riddles (sinik ), and 6 non-literary texts such as histories of the
Iraqw (alqado ) , as well as interviews.

External objects are usually in front of the core of the sentence. They can either
or follow the external subject. If they precede the external subject, the extern al
is topic; see 7. 7.

' And the lion finished the cattle.'
If the external object is a sentence, this sentence follows the core of the main sen
and the object pronoun is feminine; see 10.

The internal object holds contrastive emphasis. In the following sentences the second
sentence differs from the first in the fact that 'maize' has priority over other crops. In
the third sentence, there is contrastive emphasis on the numeral which is inside the
core of the sentence.

This cons truction with a split object is common for verbal nouns and their patient
nouns. The patient of the nominalised verb is the external object. The object pronoun
referring to it, together with the verbal noun, is the internal object.

The external object can also follow the core of the sentence. This is a highly

construction is similar to that of the linked noun after the verb; see 7 .2.5. The verb
be' does not need to be dependent. For example in. the following sentence, 'fear'��f·""'��·; ...,,. rm:;The object carries a construct case suffix if it ends in a noun as we have seen in 7.2.2.
In such a
case, the noun and the verb form a close-knit combination, that is, the noun is not
modified by any noun suffix, nor can an adverb come between the noun and the verb.
This construction is often used with body parts. Usually there is an external object
and/or an object pronoun in addition to and related to the bare core-internal noun.
The noun can be in a logical combination with the verb, like saga d eeqw 'to shave
the head' sage naa> 'to cut the heads (the hair)' or fixed expressions like saga aw
'
'
'to go in front'. The noun is like an adverb; the noun can be placed sentence-finally
and if it is, it requires the resun;ptive pronoun ale

A special case of a prepositional phrase is the coordinating preposition nee 'and, with'.
If a list of nouns is coordinated, the coordinating preposition nee can be but need not
be repeated.

Within such a coordinated noun construction, a nominal suffix refers only to the
to which it is suffixed. The same applies for adjectives. Adjectives can only
the last noun. If it is to refer to both nouns, the adjective must be repeated . In
after the preposition nee a new noun phrase follows.

"4.2. 7. Participles
In present tense relative clauses with the head as subject, the verb form is not inflected
for person, but for number and gender only, like adjectives. This participle has a high
tone after masculine head nouns and a low tone after feminine head nouns. The same
holds for adjectives. The head noun is in the premodifier form, as is the case before
any relative clause or if an adjective f�llows.

"2 . 1 .3. Tone.
There is a low and a high tone. The high tone is indicated with an acute accent on the
vowel, and in syllables with a long vowel is written on the first vowel symboL Low tone
is indicated by the absence of an acute accent on the vowel symbol(s) of the syllable.
Tone has a low functional load in the lexicon. In verbs, tone has a function in the
conjugation system but not to distinguish lexical items. Adverbs can have a low or a
high tone on the final syllable. The overall majority of nouns are low throughout. Some
nouns, about 200, have a hig� tone on the final syllable. This is lexically determined.
If a number suffix is attached to a noun with a final hig4 tone, the high tone becomes
low.
naanu 'side dish', pl: naaneemo
It is possible to derive a name from an ordinary noun by adding a high tone to the
last syllable; see 3. 7. This accounts for the tonal minimal pairs in the lexicon that are
mentioned by Whiteley ( 1958) and Nordbustad ( 1988:19). They involve insect names
based on a noun. Otherwise there are no tonal minimal pairs in the lexicon.
hlooro 'foam'
hloor6 'grasshopper which produces foam'
konkomo 'cock'
konkom6 'kind of insect that eats beans (like a chicken) 'Tone is important in grammar. Nominal suffixes that render a noun specific, such as
the demonstrative, possessive, and a construct case suffix, have a high tone, but the
specific indefinite suffix has a low tone. Personal pronouns and the numbers one to
nine have a high tone on the final syllable. On the verb, tone indicates tense and mood;
see 4.2.4. In adjectives, tone indicates gender; see 5.1 .
In general, the high tone only occurs on the last syllable, but nouns with a high tone
on the final syllable of the stem can have a sequence of two high syllables if a high tone2322
suffix follows. The last two syllables of a word can also be high due to the presence
two adjacent high tone suffixes.

The penultimate syllable of a noun is high in the vocative.
daaqay 'Boys!'
konk6mo ' Cock!' (in stories)
Another circumstance in which the penultimate syllable is pronounced high is in exag
geration, in order to make cleai that the followi,ng syllable is low.
lee1eehh 'he searches�, not leeleehh 'I search'The only case in which there may be more than one change of pitch in a single
is when the penultimate syllable of trisyllabic (or longer) word is high.
The background and the infinitive suffixes render preceding high tones low.

2. 1 .4. Stress.
In addition to tone and vowel length, there is non-contrastive predictable word stress.
In the following examples, stress is indicated by underlining the vowel. Stress must be
recognised as phonetically different from vowel length, because there are oppositions

Yes/no questions have a special intonation. This intonation contour consists
extra rise in tone and a fall on the penultimate syllable of the predicate. Usually

BACKWord-finally and before a consonant ay-u results in o , tsatosa 'because of a knife'.
The masculine nouns in ay end in oo for the construct case, tsat6o do oh ling 'the
knife of your house'. However, hee 'man' is hee in the construct case, only a high
tone and no gender linker. For the exceptional masculine nouns ending in a there is
variation between 6o and u: garm6o or garmu 'boy of', taat6o 'forefather of',
but naan u 'big boy of', filu 'aardvark of', hhiyu 'brother of', hhuumpu 'lung of'.
origin of o o in these masculine words in could be the masculine construct case
pronoun o o.
I cannot explain the exceptional behaviour of these few masculine nouns in a. One
somea8988
possibility is that these words originally ended in a glottal stop. Nouns ending in
masculine. There is a set of masculine nouns ending in a, that might have lost t he
glottal stop. With the glottal stop the vowel of the gender linker, u would be
according to the syllable reduction rule, ( 4) in 2.3. As a relict, the u is still

The feminine gender marker -r and the instrumental suffix -r require an epent
vowel a after a consonant, e.g. hasam-r-1 -+ hasamari 'these problems' . And if
r is preceded by an epenthetic vowel a, r is not deleted before an alveolar cons
as it should be according to rule (7) in 2.5.2.

But no glide is inserted before the directional suffix -i in the same context.yaamu-i -+ yaami 'to the ground'
yaamu-i -+ yaamuwi 'this ground'
A gl ide w is also inserted after a vowel (and after ay ) and before all noun suffixesstarting in a round vowel: the background suffix -o , the possessive suffixes -ok and-os.awu-u-o -+ awuwo 'bull (m), background case'

"Some adverbs end in wa, which could be a relic of the ablative case clitic: tseewa
'early', 16wa 'very' (from lo' 'true') , tsuwa 'for sure, really'. In male the resumptive
pronoun ale may be fused. halo is based on hal 'day'. qar6 is related to qaren
(adj) 'old'. Two adverbs seem. to contain the adverb ak 'more': lak 'almost ', mak
�somew h a t ' . With l6wa 'very' a construct case linker is sometimes added. More often
it is not. The form ganhlar 'fast' contains a construct case suffix. There is no noun
ganhla without the construct case suffix.",[113]
"The meaning of the suffix -ay is collective in, for example,

daray 'mane'
dicay 'fat'
diway 'salt'

The high tone in ay is part of the lexical entry and has to be realised on the final
syllable, cf. waqa_t (m) 'intestines', waqantay · (m) 'a collection of intestines': The
corresponding- singular or plural forms do not have a high tone, but, for nouns with a
high tone in the singular, the plural form ->i is preceded by an epenthetic vowel that
assimilates to the following vowel resulting in -i>i .
guhhulay (m) I guhhuli>i (n)
stick with a knob, club
maamay (m) I maami>i ( )
maternal uncle
nNouns with the suffix -angw (m) are singular in general. A plural interpretation is
possible, with the adjective referring to separate entities of the sum. If there is another
plural form, it is formed by suffixation of -eeri or -aawe.

There is a similar suffix -iingw for nouns derived from verbs with a durative suffix
-iim, see 3.3.
3.2.4. 2. Plural suffixesIn general, the plural suffixes have no other meaning than plurality. Some of the plural
nouns are based on a noun that already has a plural meaning. In these cases there is5150
difference in meaning between the various plural forms with the same noun st
plural form such as tsunqareeri of a noun which is already plural, tsuuqa '
means 'saliva at different places'. hhamhham>i means all the eyebrows and
of one person; hhamhhamo is singular, 'eyebrow, eyelash, eyelid' and
is the general plural. hoom>i 'groups of enemies' is the plural of hooma '
which is already plural. tsarhham>i 'foreheads' is the plural of tsarhhaadu,
plural too and refers to the two sides of a forehead with a regressing hairline. For
cases with more than one plural form for the same lexical stem there is no cliff
in meaning, xadeemo or xado (n) 'bushes, places of worship'............. .. .u:u.u. .... u.","[32, 33]"

The other plural suffix for adjectives is -t for adjectives that end in r, and
shortening of the final syllable for those that end in a different consonant. T he
has the same morphophonological behaviour as the third person feminine
subject suffix -d in the verbal conjugation; see 4.2.3.

Some adjectives have no distinct plural form. The adjectives aben 'new' and

The fact that yaariit 'many' has no plural form is conceivable. This word refers to

There are some compound adjectives of which the first part is a noun. The noun does
not display the gender link er, nor the high tone of the construct case suffix. More or
less the same set of nouns used in compound adjectives is used in compound verbs;
see 4.4. In the following, I include verbs or nouns that are compounds containing an
adjective as the second element.

The adjective wahl 'without' only occurs in compound adjectives.
wahl adj . 'without'
ii>awahl 'foolishly stubborn,
deaf', ii>a 'ear'
xuu'awahl 'stupid' (without
knowing, xuu>a 'knowing' )
The first element i s much more free compared t o other compounds. Noun plus
has no different forms for singular and plural. The compound is preceded by the
forms of 'to be' that are used for adjectives on which no tense difference can be
Therefore I consider the noun plus wahl combination as a compound adjective an�
not as a noun plus noun or a noun plus verb combination.

The impersonal object pronouns for a first or second person object all begin with
there is no object, the impersonal subject form is ta. We may assume that the
is in fact the impersonal subject form ta. The vowel a is deleted before another
according to the vowel coalescence rule (5) of 2.5. 1 . The first person plural form
a contraction of ta-ti . The second person plural pronoun is underlyingly ndu .
sequence nd becomes n word-initially, cf. ( 19) in 2.5.4. The vowel of ta
assimilation to the following vowel in tundu. Thus ta-ndu results in tundu.
The i �persona! object pronouns for third person objects also begin in t if they
used m a relative clause to refer to the head noun. These forms also consist of
impersonal ta followed by the object pronouns with deletion of the a because of
coalescence, rule (5) in 2.5.1.
Other third person object pronouns with an impersonal subject start with k-.
suming that these forms also contain the impersonal subject marker ta, the inif
. some explanation. Since
reqmres
there is a third person object marker g- which
be recognised in other forms, see below, I will assume that this k is a result of
assimilation and consonant cluster simplification rule gt k which operates in
object pronoun system. Thus ku is g-ta-u 0.3-IMPS-O .M. The object pronouns
a for feminine objects, u for masculine objects, and i for neuter objects.
The same forms ku , ka, ki are used for the third person object pronouns of
dependent series when the subject is first person plural or second person ·
or plural. Exactly for these subjects the form of the dependent 'to be' is also
homophonous with the impersonal subject marker; see table 5. These forms also
of g-ta-u, g-ta- a , and g-ta-i. Thus the Jormula of the third person object p
of the dependent series is g- dependent 'to be'-object pronoun. With � first

Yes/no questions are often used rhetorically. Without a negation marker ' the speaker
expects a negative reply, for example:289288
g a-rtakoond-athing:C ON-F DEP.S.l/2 have:2.SG:INT-INF
'Do you have the thing? (Expectation: you don't.) '
If a negation marker is present, where the negation follows the question t
m onat1
expected reply is in the affirmative, e.g.
·ga-rtaiskoond-a-keething:C ON-F D EP.S.l/2 have:2.SG-INF:INT-NEG:BACK
'You have the thing, don't you?'
However, in cases where the negation precedes the question intonat1'on , as can
m t h e £o 11owmg example, the expected reply is negative:
··ga-rtakoond-a-keething:C � N-F DEP.S.l/2 have:2.SG-INF-NEG:B ACK:INT

Complex sentences can consist of a series of clauses in consecutive tense. The consecu­
tive tense suffixes require the dependent verb 'to be', although the main verb is in the
indicative mood.

If the verb is transiti ve and the complement clause is an external object, there is a
feminine object pronoun in the core of the sentence. In 7. 1 .4. I have argued that an
unspecific object has feminin e gender, because the least specific non-human noun, gaa291290
'thing' is femin ine. For the same reason there is a femin ine objec
t pronoun
referring to the complement clause.

4.1 .7. Additional affixes: Order and possible combinations
In table (3) in 4. 1 . all the possible affixes to the verbs 'to be' were given. In par
4.1 .2. I introduced what can fall under the heading 'to be', represented by B E in
scheme. In paragraphs 4.1 .3.-4.1 .6., these basic forms of 'to be' were further elab
on. In paragraphs 4.1. 7.-4.1 . 16. I will discuss the various affixes. Before pro
will discuss which combinations of affixes and verbs 'to be' in table (3) are pos
and what their order is.

The table itself already indicates that everything that is in one column is mut
exclusive. Thus it is impossible to combine several mood prefixes within one form,
several aspect affixes. In one exceptional case, a combination of case clitics is possi
