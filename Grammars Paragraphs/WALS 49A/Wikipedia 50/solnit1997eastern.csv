Typological OutlineThe purpose of this chapter is to provide an overview of
the Kayah Li language before launching into detailed description. In doing so I will make use of both standard typological
parameters,suchas word-order,andof moretraditional cate-gories such as ‘tonal’, hoping to situate the languagein theSoutheast Asian areal context as well as among human languages
in general. A more practical consideration is to familiarize the
reader with basic Kayah Li sentence structure and with a short
list of high-frequency morphemes, which should ease comprehension of the upcoming example sentences and expressions. For
example, since virtually every clause contains at least one pronoun, I give a list of pronouns here so that the reader does not
need to hunt out the chapter (6) on Nouns and the NP, where the
pronoun system is discussed.
Note that the use of familiar terms like Noun, Verb, Indirect Object, Prepositional Phrase, and so on, should not be takento meanthat the KayahLi phenomenaare identical in everyrespect to their counterparts of these names in familiar languageslike English. They are similar enough that the familiar terms canPart I: GrammarTypological Outlineprovide an entry into understanding the item in question, but indissimilation in prefixes.

"This meansspecification for co-Occurrence with the ‘core’ grammatical relations Subject, Object
and Indirect Object (for specifics of these grammatical relations57Part I: GrammarThe Verb Complexsee Chapter 5). This specification is said to LICENSE the occurrence of these relations; it is a feature of every verb, and of a few
VPtc’s as well. Besides the three core grammatical relations,to each other. I will use Foley and Van Valin’s terms, Actor for
the role with the most Proto-Agent properties and Undergoer for
the role with the most Proto-Patient properties; Foley & Van
Valin call these ‘macroroles’. With Dowty, I assume that thethere are also a few cases in which it makes sense to recognize
specification for certain oblique grammatical relations, but these
will concern us more in Chapter 5 than in this one. Most generally useful is a classification of verbs into Vj, V, and V4, taking

The rarity of maximal NP’s in natural speech is undoubt-edly not due to a rule of Kayah Li grammar, but is a consequence

constituents of prefixes, both segmental and tonal, are a subset of
the inventory of possible constituents of full syllables. Lexical
items may consist of various combinations of full syllables and
prefixes: se ‘fruit’ (full syllable), pané ‘buffalo’ (prefix + full syl-lable), s4ra ‘teacher’ (full syllable + full syllable), tarecui ‘regularly, all the time’ (prefix + full syllable + full syllable), mélaké
‘pineapple’ (full syllable + prefix + full syllable), hdsoph5 ‘airplane’ (three full syllables), Tokeluphé[name] (prefix + threefull syllables).
A ‘prefix’ here is defined phonologically, and is not nec-essarily a morpheme, as in the example poné ‘buffalo’, which is
a single morpheme. Some prefixes are indeed autonomous morphemes, e.g. to- ‘one’ in numeral-classifier constructions such as
todd ‘one (animal)’. There are also two elements that are analyzed as suffixes but they are of relatively minor importance (see2.4, 3.3.3).

"Undoubtedly many other Kayah Li affixes are relic forms
as well. This is a common situation in Tibeto-Burman, as is cyclical prefixation: as old prefixes are lost or fuse with initials, newones arise (see Matisoff 1978, 1.122 on the ‘compounding/prefixation cycle’). E.g. the th- of Kayah thé ‘pig’, thé ‘bear’ andthwi ‘dog’ is in origin an old prefix, the Tibeto-Burman roots

That PsAtrC’s must be treated as clauses is shown by their

well as structural factors.
Anypostposed AtrC has an equivalent preposed AtrC,although the modified head must differ: noun for the former, Clf'

"In the discussion that follows, I will use the term ‘root V,’to refer to lexical verbs with a given syntactic valence, and likewise to VC’s containing such verbs but no argument-adding morphemes. ‘Compound V,’ will then be a VC including some argument-adding morpheme which interacts with the head verb’s
syntactic valence to produce a valence for the VC as a unit. For
instance,a root V, isa VCcontaininga V, and no argumentadding morpheme, while a compound V, is a VC with a oneargument head verb plus some argument-adding morpheme that
brings the total of licensed syntactic positions up to two.
In this connection, it is important to remember that argu-ment-adding morphemes have both semantic and syntactic spec-ifications. Semantic features specify the participant role of themonly, that of animate starting point (source). Examples with IO

bullets in particular, but simply names the general category ‘bullet’. It is in reality a sort of abbreviation of the compound Noun

of Kayah Li. Kayah in turn is a Central Karen language, and
Karen is a major subdivision of the Tibeto-Burman branch of
Sino-Tibetan. Kayah Li is thus very closely related to languages
like Bwe and Bré; less closely to other Karen languages like
Sgaw, Pho and Pa-O (Taungthu); more distantly to hundreds of
languagesincludingTibetan,Burmese,Lahu, Yi, Lushai,etc.;and most remotely to Chinese.
Karen is a well-defined subgroup of Tibeto-Burman, with
no questionable members. It covers a relatively continuous block
of territory extending to either side of the Thailand-Burma border, plus outlying scattered groups of Sgaw in the Irrawady delta.
Sgaw is the largest Karen language in number of speakers, with
Pho probably second largest. Population figures can only be
approximate; one guess for total speakers of Karen languages is
between3 to 4.5million,withperhaps300,000in Thailand.","[5, 6]"

Phré:ro333Part ILGlossary and IndexKayah Li-English GlossaryThis glossary includes all Kayah Li forms cited in the
Grammar and occurring in the Texts, plus selected core vocabulary items. Interjections are omitted.
Clearly-related items with distinct meanings or grammatical categories are combined in a single entry; for example, khri
‘be shattered’ (V), ‘a fragment’ (N), ‘C:shards’ (Clf).
Little attempt has been made to indicate the analysis of
polymorphemic items. For example, si?iché ‘afraid’ probably
consists of si ‘heart’ and ché ‘hurt’; but the former component is
suggested only by the word’s alphabetical listing next to other
items beginning with sf, while the latter is not indicated at all,
although ché may be found in its alphabetically determined place.
The glossary is arranged in ordinary alphabetical order,
subject to the following additional conventions:
1. Entries are ordered by the phonological initial of the
first full syllable. Ordering by phonological initial rather than by
first letter means that aspirates and complex initials are separated
out from each other; e.g. p ph phr pl. Prefixed forms (those begin-ning ?f ?i ko to pa) are listed under the initial of the full syllable; e.g. kajé follows jé and precedes jo.
2. Zero initial comes first. Glottal stop is between n and p.
3. Order of rhymis

rhyme, not the initial, and are ordered accordingly.
