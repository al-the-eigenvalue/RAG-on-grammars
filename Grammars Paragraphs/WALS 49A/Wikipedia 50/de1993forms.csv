"The same grammatical head nouns which function in relative terms, also occur as head nouns
in questioned terms of question-word questions. In (328) ro occurs as the head noun of the
questioned term narnfo ro 'what ' ; in (329) rumu occurs as the head noun of the questioned
term yafo-rumu ' who ' . Questioned terms tend to be expressed according to the preferred80
pattern (ii) for tenns, that is, modifier plus head noun. In most cases, ro and rumu are the

"3.2 NOUNS
Nouns are words which may take possessive pronominal prefixes (see section 3 .3).
Apart from the expression of possession there is no noun-related morphology.
Functionally, nouns are the unmarked heads of noun phrases (NP). As such they may be
modified by adjectives. Other categories that may function as heads of NP, for example,
pronouns, do not have this possibility of adjectival modification.
Semantically, kinship terms form an interesting category of nouns in Kombai because of
the extensive skewing of 'natural' and terminological generations (see de Vries 1987).
Compound nouns may be formed by combining noun stems into one noun. The
modifying stem always precedes the modified stem in the compound noun, for example,
wodei 'river' and bei 'bank' may be combined to become wodeibei 'riverbank'; the
modifying stem attracts the main word stress in these compounds.
There are also compound nouns in which the two noun stems are equivalent, that is,
without a modifier/modified relation; for example momo ' mother's brother' and lage 'sister's
son' are combined to form the noun momolage 'family'.
There is no derivation of nouns from verbs or other categories. When clauses function as
NP (subordinate clauses), there is some restructuring towards a more nominal form but this
restructuring hardly affects the verb of the embedded clause; instead, head noun insertion
takes place. Only in purpose clauses with Ii do we find infinitival forms in the embedded35
clause; infinitives (see section 3. 1 .3 .5) have to a certain extent nominal properties. (See
Chapter 5 for Kombai nominalisation.)3.3 PRONOUNS
Kombai has six personal pronouns:
( 1 46)SOPLnu1:
2:
3:gu
kheI
you
he/shelit1:
2:
3:nagu
nage
yawe
you (PL)
theySome speakers have agu instead of nagu ( 1 PL personal pronoun).
When prefixed to nouns, the forms of ( 1 46) function as possessive pronouns. For I S O
and 3PL there are special possessive forms:
( 1 47)SO1:
2:
3:nagukhe-my

their coconutFor the 3PL possessive form some speakers have yafo-.
Reflexive pronouns are formed by suffixing -ra ' self' to the forms of ( 1 46) (nu-ra, khe­
ra, etc.):
( 1 48)Kho mene khe-ra
bafera.
this him-self DUR. see.3S0.NF
This man is seeing himself.
manEmphatic or focus forms are formed by adding the focus marker -a (see section 3.8.3.2. 1 ) to
the forms of ( 1 46) (nuf-a, guf-a, etc.):
( 1 49)badiya ?
Doti nuf-a
adu-ra
sago me-FOe prepare.in.the.fire. S S-and DUR.give.2S0.NF
Is it for me that you are preparing the sago?","[44, 45]"
"Notice that (330)-(332) still confonn to the preferred modifier plus HN structure. There are
some question-words which do not confonn to the preferred pattern: for example, fenemo
' where' functions as head of the q-tenn; in such cases the head of the q-tenn is not a noun
but a question-word which cannot take modifiers:
(333)Gu fenemo ba-kha-khe?
you where DUR-go.2SG.NF-Q
Where are you going?",[90]
"I have not found ro ' thing' outside the contexts of question-words, RCs and (other)
subordinate clauses. This is different from rumu which functions as a lexical predicate
(kinship term) and as a relational noun. The lexical function or meaning of ' thing' is
expressed by the noun agarabo (e.g. (355» . The grammatical functions of ro have been
described above (section 5.2). Example (356) exemplifies the grammatical function of ro as a
classificatory HN.
The category 'relationally used lexical item ' in (350) is a tran sitional category; many
languages have functors (e.g. English because which can be shown to have developed from
an earlier relationally used lexical item (English bye cause of>.
This transitional nature of relationally used lexical items often makes it hard to decide
what the categorial status of a relational noun or verb is. Rumu still seems to function as
noun when used as HN in RCs and question-words: it functions as head of the term phrase
to which the question-word and RC are linked as modifiers by -0, the (obligatory) modifier­
head noun connective. Rumu shows no fonn changes.",[98]
"Sometimes the modifier-head connective - 0 links the noun to nage (e.g. (240) and (24 1 » and
this suggests that nage could be a relational noun and not a postpositional relator. On the
other hand the generalised grammatical meaning of nage and the absence of -0 in a
considerable number of cases indicate that nage is developing into a relator. Notice that we
have not yet found nage used as a non-relational noun . The original lexically specific
meaning of nage we do not know.
The semantic relation instrument is also often expressed by the relational use of the verb

"3. 1 .3.4 COPULAS; THE VERB 'TO BE'
Copula-support is a syntactic process which enables members of nominal categories
(nouns, adjectives, pronouns) to function predicatively. When supported by copulas, such
nominal predicates retain their categorial status as nouns.",[40]
"In ( 1 83) the question-word nalufa 'what' is head of the questioned NP. In ( 1 84) we have the
unmarked case: the question-word functions as a modifier in the questioned phrase. In ( 1 83)
nalufa may be replaced by narofo ro 'what thing' which has the unmarked modifier + head
structure.
In ( 1 83) the question-word has object function and therefore occupies the object position
in the clause. In ( 1 84) the questioned NP has subject function and is positioned accordingly.
The focus nature of question-words is in Kombai expressed by intonational prominence
and the (optional) focus-marker -a (see section 3.8.3.2. 1 ) . In the Flamingo B ay dialect of the
neighbouring Asmat family emphasising words (Voorhoeve 1 965 : 1 68) also occur with
certain question-words (Voorhoeve 1965 : 1 59).
In ( 1 83) and ( 1 84) we find this focus-marker -a before the question-marker -khe (see
section 3 . 1 .3.3.4. 1 .2). This question-clitic which occurs optionally in all types of questions
as a clause-final predicate-clitic, occurs in question-word questions also on the questioned
NP (optionally).
As stated above, the question-words function preferably as modifiers in modifier + head
structures. Now with question-words concerning persons the modifier is yafo- 'who' and
the head noun is one of the following nouns:
( 1 85)miyo
rum u
mogochild
son
person43nariya
nariyamogoman
manWith question-words concerning things, the modifier is narofo ' what' and the head noun TO
' thing ' .
Some examples:
( 1 86)Gu narof-o
TO
bo-fera-kha ?
you what-CONN thing DUR-see.2SG.NF-Q
What are you looking at?","[52, 53]"
"46
This last factor, positioning reflecting semantic association, is most clearly operative in
the case of the adverbial clitics -khu 'also' and -adi 'only' ; these adverbs cliticise to the
constituents with which they are associated semantically:
(205)khakhede.
Khe-lu-adi
his-word-only listen. 1 SG.NF
I listened only to his words.","[55, 56]"
"Disjunctions with khale are open-ended (non-exhaustive). In (225), an example taken from
the same text as (224), we see the modifier-head connective -0 linking the members of the
disj unction to khale:

I n (225) - 0 (harmonised to -a after lan-) links lan- 'woman ' and khof- 'man ' to the relator
khale. In section 3 . 8.2. 1 we have analysed the connective clitic -0 as a modifier-head
connective. If the connective in (225) has this modifier-head linking function, then khale
must be head and lan- and khof- attributive noun modifiers. If khale is a head, it must be a
noun and not a relator.
To understand khale, it is necessary to take into account the role of relational nouns and
verbs in Awyu-family languages. In these languages we find extensive use of members of
lexical ' content' categories (nouns and verbs) as relators, expressing a wide range of
semantic and pragmatic functions. (See Chapter 5 for the relational use of nouns and verbs.)
To distinguish between relationally-used nouns or verbs and relators, the following
criteria may be used (cf. Chapter 5):
(226)a.loss of specific lexical content and development of generalised grammatical
meanings;b . loss of the head of NP function for nouns and head of predicate function for
verbs;
c . form-changes (shortening, cliticisation).",[59]
"6.5 SUMMARY
Direct quotation plays a role in the following domains.
The second arguments of speech act verbs are expressed by direct quotation clauses (e.g.
(360)-(365» . In a few cases, these arguments are expressed by co-subordination (cf. (402),
(404» but in those cases the verbs of speaking have causative meanings.
Reported speech and reported thought are handled similarly in Kombai: direct quotation is
used in both domains.
When intentional thoughts are reported, a crucial factor is whether intender and intended
are the same or not. When they differ, direct quotation is used obligatorily (cf. (375)-(376» .
When they are the same, the situation is more complicated. With first person intenders,
quotation is not used (see (377)-(378» except for constructions with motion-verbs (see
(379». For second/third person intenders, quotation is obligatory with positive intention but
optional with negative intention.
In the domain of non-intentional thought, direct quotation is used in narrative discourse to
portray mental processes of participants (e.g. (393».
The syntactic relation between direct quotation and quotation-margin shows considerable
independence for the quotation-clause. The non-embeddedness of the direct quotation may be
one of the reasons why direct quotation is such a preferred strategy in Kombai, In a rigid
verb-final language, the direct quotation strategy makes it possible for complex material to be
expressed after the verb, or rather independent of the position of the verb, since the complex
constituent is not in construction with the verb.",[113]
"5.3 RELATIONAL NOUNS AND GRAMMATICALISATION
5.3. 1 INTRODUCTION
Thus far I have taken the notion 'relational noun' for granted. Now I shall examine the
assumptions related to that notion.
In the first place, I assume a fundamental distinction between two types of stems in
language. The lexicon stores the basic contentive elements, nominal, verbal and adjectival
predicates. The expression-rules specify grammatical or fonn e
, lements used to express
functions (e.g. subject, focus, agent) and operators (definiteness, tense). These grammatical
elements (conjunctions, demonstratives, tense-suffixes, etc.) are opposed to lexical elements
(see also Watters 1985:92).
Secondly, within the domain of grammatical elements, I assume a distinction between
relationally or grammatically used lexical items and purely grammatical elements or functors.
Relational nouns and verbs retain their categorial status as noun or verb. Functors may be
subdivided categorially into categories of functors, demonstratives, tense-markers, etc.
according to distributional criteria.
Relational nouns are grammatical elements, specified by the expression-rules (see (350))
but they stay nouns and this categorial status enables them to function as heads of tenn
phrases. However, having grammatical functions, they tend to lose their categorial status of
noun and become members of one of the functor categories. In this process of category­
change, relational nouns lose the noun function of being head of the tenn phrase. This
function change is then followed by fonn changes, like shortening and cliticisation. A
specific Awyu-family diagnostic for nounhood of relational nouns is the behaviour of the
modifier-head noun linker -0 (see section 3.8.2. 1 ). When a relational noun becomes functor,
-0 becomes optional first and is then lost altogether.
When a lexical item develops a secondary use as a relational lexical item, in this secondary
use there will be semantic changes which may be called grammaticalisation of meaning: in
this development there is a loss of lexical specificity, and the relationally used lexical item
acquires generalised grammatical meanings. The category of relationally used lexical items is
a transitional category, a bridge between the two basic categories of lexical items and
functors.
Example (350) summarises the distinctions made in this section; in the next sections I
shall apply (350) to ro 'thing' and rum u 'person ':87

"In (325) the relative term refers to male and female persons; sex is irrelevant and in such
cases rumu, the unmarked choice of the 'person' -set (323) for relative clauses, is used.",[88]
"Expressions like an old lady, the theory of relativity and John would be examples of
prototypically expressed terms. Notice that the notion of 'term ' is a functional one, and not a
categorial one; terms are expressions, whatever their categorial make-up, which are used by
speakers in the pragmatic and co-operative activity of referring (see Dik 1 978).
The Kombai preferred expression for terms (ii) follows from the language-independent

conform to (ii), the preferred expression for terms in Kombai. This is indeed the case: they
are expressed as modifiers of the relational head nouns ro ' thing' and rum u 'person' .

As for khale, our data about khale are rather limited but tentatively we might apply (226) to
khale as follows. The noun khale possibly means 'kind, sort' and like the Indonesian noun
maeam 'kind, sort' , in combination with another noun it may mean ' like, as, resembling ' :
(227)Indonesian:Orang itu semaeam anak keeil.
person that like
child little
That person is like a little child.

Kho khenoduf-o khale abo-n-o
child-CONN like be.3SG.NF-TR-CONN person
A man who is like a child, . . .manLiterally (228) says 'the resemblance of a child' . I n (224)-(225) khale does not have this
specific lexical content of 'resemblance ' but a general grammatical meaning of inclusive
disj unction ( ' or'). Thus semantically (criterion a. of (226)) khale has developed a
conjunction-like grammatical meaning. Syntactically (criterion b. of (226)), a diagnostic for
the noun-hood of relational nouns in Awyu-Ianguages is the presence or absence of modifier­
head connectives. In the case of khale, -0 is sometimes present and sometimes absent. Again
this points to the loss of noun-hood since -0 is an obligatory modifier-head noun linker in
noun phrases. The fact that -0 is sometimes still there points to the transitory state of khale
between relational noun and relator. Accordingly, there are not yet formal changes typical for
relators. Since content items tend to get main word stress whereas relators do not receive this
stress, relators tend to be reduced to shorter forms (criterion c. of (226)).
The connective -0 not only functions as a modifier-head connective within noun phrases
but also as an inclusive non-exhaustive enumerator, with the same meaning as khale:

"3.1.3.3.5 ASPECT
3.1.3.3.5.1 HABITUAL-ITERATIVE
When an action is intrinsically repetitive or when a plural subject implies repetition of the
action or when a habit implies repetition, in all these cases habitual-iterative verbs may be
used. The derivation of these verbs has been discussed in section 3.1.2.4. Sentence (100) is
an example of an habitual-iterative verb:

In ( 1 00) the habitual-iterative verb gegemo- is used because a public discussion (verbal

3.8.4 RELATORS IN SUBORDINATE AND COORDINATE CLAUSES
Subordinate clauses function as constituents of other clauses, the main clauses. Co­
ordination in the Papuan context generally involves the chaining of coordinate-dependent
clauses (medial clauses) and this is also the case in Kombai.
Apart from subordinate and medial (coordinate-dependent) clauses there is a third type of
clause in Kombai, the final or independent clause. Example (259) shows the distribution of
dependent and independent verb forms over the clause types in Kombai:
Kombai clauses(259)finalsubordinatemedial/\DSSSIIindep vdep vindep vindep vWhen independent verb forms are used in medial-coordinate clauses, they indicate DS
following. Thus medially the finite versus non-finite distinction expresses the DS versus S S
opposition.","[65, 66]"
"Example (287) is an attempt to formulate a typology of these grounds for topicality.
Yesterday is a frame, I a given topic and a big fire a new topic in terms of this typology. In
de Vries ( 1 989:Ch.3) I have stressed that the distinctions embodied in the taxonomy of
topicality only correspond to pragmatic functions in the grammar of a language as far as the
expressive devices of a language code these distinctions emically in the morpho-syntax of
expressions. Every language has its own patterns of neutralisation and diversifIcation with
respect to these distinctions.
In the strongest case of neutralisation a language would use the same expressive devices
for all types of topics, irrespective of the grounds for their topicality. Such a language would
distinguish one type of topic (general topic), covering both framing and topical span types of
topics. One level lower in (287), a language would distinguish formally between frames and
topical span related topics. S till lower in (287), a language could distinguish between
establishing topicality (new topic) and maintaining topicality (given topics), etc. For a more
detailed treatment of topical span analysis see de Vries ( 1989:Chapter 3).
Framing differs from the identifIcation of topical entities in topical spans as follows.
These spans have the aspects of introducing topical entities into the discourse and keeping
track of them. Framing does not have these aspects but has to do with relating the present
sentence to the organising centre of the discourse, for the example the time-line and place-line
in a narrative; frames have a relational character.
A given frame constituent normally occurs only once whereas it is in the very nature of
topics to have multiple occurrence in discourse, the form in which the occurrences take place
depending on the phase of the topical span.
In narrative discourses all over the world the spatio-temporal dimension is the unmarked
organising centre, generating temporal and spatial frame phrases, that is, inanimate frames.
At the same time, in narratives animate entities tend to be more prominent entities; thus topics
tend to be animate.
A constituent may be both topic and frame (cf. 'Mr Serby' in the first section (a)-(b) of
(286)). There are also constituents like in France in (286b) which are neither frame nor topic
(background entities). When in a sentence there is both a topic and a frame, the frame is
positioned before the topic:
(289)Yesterday (frame) I (topic) was ill.",[74]
"In (34) vowel-harmony has not taken place: the durative prefIx has its basic form bo-; in (35)
there is ba- before the central vowel of the verb stem and in (36) be- before the front vowel
of the verb stem.
In some cases, with the back vowel lui, there is harmonisation to lui instead of 10/. Thus
the support-verb -ma is harmonised to -rna in (37), the normal assimilation in the context of
back vowels, but in (38) there is complete harmonisation to the lui of the preceding stem.
(37)Fum-rna
kha.
good-SUPP.SS go.3SG.NF
He went well.",[22]
"4.3. 1 .2 SENTENTIAL PARAGRAPHS
The other relatum of frames is the sentential paragraph. Narratives have the sentential
paragraph as their basic building block. By paragraph I mean a unit of discourse in between
the smallest unit, the single verb clause, and the largest, the narrative as a whole. These
narrative paragraphs have very clearly marked boundaries since the paragraph in Kombai
narratives coincides with a syntactic unit, the sentence.
These sentences contain medially dependent verb forms and finally independent verb
forms. Independent verb forms may also occur medially and if they do so, they function as
medial D S verbs. Now whenever an independent verb with falling intonation on the last
syllable(s), is followed by a verb form with rising intonation on the last syllable(s), there is a
sentence boundary. In addition to this, frames mark the beginning of a new sentence. frames
are optional but they are present in the great majority of narrative sentences. In most cases,
these frames are expressed by tail-head linkage constructions (see below).
The combination of intonation, verb types and tail-head linkage makes sentence
boundaries very easy to detect in Kombai narratives.
Sentences do not only have clear boundaries, they also have very predictable internal
structures, represented by (29 1 ) :67
(29 1 )Sentential paragraph: ±frame±medial chain+final clauseSentential paragraphs consist of three parts; the first part is the frame constituent, then there
is a middle section of chained single verb clauses and the final part is an independent verb
clause with falling intonation towards the end.
The final clause is the syntactic nucleus of the sentential paragraph : it is the only
obligatory part, although the other parts are almost always present. The medial chain and
often also the frame depend on the [mal clause.
Medial-final chains are found in very many TNGP languages. S uch chains sometimes
form paragraph-like discourse chunks as in Kombai narratives but in other languages
""medial-final chains may be interpreted as sentence units which build quite regularly into
paragraphs j ust as in an Indo-European language. This is true, for example, in Manambu,
Golin, Gahuku, and Yessan-Mayo."" (Longacre 1 972:40). The relation between verb types
and sentence/paragraph boundaries in chains also varies from language to language. For
example in chains of Telefol, an Ok language, finite dependent verb forms mark the end of
the sentence and independent verbs mark the end of the paragraph (Healey 1 966).
The frame constituent tends to be of the clausal type, although phrasal frames occur. Time
expressions in Kombai tend to take the form of clauses. There is a very restricted set of
options for the expression of frames in narratives. The overwhelming majority of frames in
narratives are either tail-head linkages or generic verb linkages or spatio-temporal phrases.
The medial chain consists of coordinate-dependent 1 2 single verb clauses occurring in
chain-like series with a very low number of expressed arguments per verb. The medial chain
may be very long (more than 20 verbs in one chain is not unusual in both Kombai and
Wambon). The tendency to leave arguments unexpressed, to express the maintaining of
topical entities in the verb morphology and to express interclausal relations in the verb
morphology combine to make the medial chain look very 'verby' and event-oriented.
The final clause has an independent verb as its centre; the final clause expresses the main
assertion of the sentential paragraph. The medial chain contains both asserted and non­
asserted information and all sorts of ' soft' presuppositions and assertions. The information
status of frames is to present the setting or framework for the subsequent narrative sentence
and to link it to the preceding list of events.
We conclude this section by illustrating some of the points made above. Consider (292)
and (293). In this section there are two given topics, 'I' and 'the snake' :
(292)U-rafalimimaye-fofali-rahit.SS -and carry.SS go.out.S S -SEQ carry.SS-andmimaye-fogedodof-odarofadef-ogo.out.S S-SEQ next wood-CONN surface put. 1 SG . NF-CONNleina gegubino u-ruma-de.after next neck

I hit it and carried it out and after I had put it on a piece of wood I cut its neck.
12Franklin (1969: 169) and Longacre (1972:2) have pointed out that the coordinate-subordinate distinction
of Indo-European languages is not equivalent to the medial-final distinction of Papuan languages. A
typical characteristic of interclausal relations in medial-final clause chains of many Papuan languages
including Kombai is the combination of dependency and non-embeddedness for which I use the term
'coordinate-dependent' following Foley (1986).","[76, 77]"

TIIINGS AND PERSONS
THE ROLE OF TO 'THING' AND rumu 'PERSON' IN KOMBAI SYNTAX AND PRAGMATICS5 . 1 INTRODUCTION
In this chapter I shall describe the syntactic and pragmatic functions of two relational
nouns, TO ' thing' and rum u 'person'. They have two functions.
Syntactically, they function as head nouns (HN) in a number of constructions; there is an
expression-rule of head noun insertion which inserts TO and rumu in relative clauses (RC)
adverbial clauses and question-word phrases.
Pragmatically, TO and Tum u have a function in the domain of reference and identification.
Adverbial clauses, relative clauses and question-word phrases function as referring
expressions, as terms (using the terminology of Dik 1 978, 1 989). Now when these terms
have TO as HN, they refer to a non-human entity and when they have rumu as HN, they refer
to a human entity. This classificatory function of TO and rum u helps the addressee to identify
the entities the speaker is referring to.
Ro and rum u are relational head nouns: they belong to a transitional category of
relation ally used lexical items. This category is the bridge in the grammaticalisation process
in which lexical items become functors (purely grammatical elements).
In section 5.2 the syntactic-pragmatic function of TO and rumu as classificatory HNs is
discussed and in section 5.3 the notion 'relational noun ' is treated in order to understand
certain grammaticalisation processes occurring in Kombai.
Dik (1985b:3) introduces the notion of 'prototypical expression model ' (PEM). The PEM
for terms is as follows:
(i)a term with a non-derived nominal as head, possibly modified by attributive
. adjectives and possessor phrases, and determined by one or more term operators
(Dik 1 985a:3).","[85, 86]"
"5you this IMP.eat.imp-QUOTE
... they brought that food and put it down and said: ""You must eat this! ""
I n (1) the independent form rofanona is followed by luwano. Both verbs have the same subject. Thus ( 1 )
constitutes a counter-example to the rule that medially used independent verbs indicate D S transitions. A
possible explanation is that examples like (1) are only apparent counter-examples. They could constitute
speech errors. Evidence supporting this possibility is that we have heard speakers correct themselves in
similar cases: they started with a medial independent verb followed by a verb with the same subject, then
replaced the medial independent form by a dependent form. This happens when a speaker first wants to
conclude his sentence, therefore choosing an independent form and then decides to add information.
The notions of conceptual distance and closeness are used here as defined by Haiman (1983: 783):
First, two concepts are conceptually close to the extent that they share semantic properties
(e.g., two verbs are closer if they share a common tense, mood, subject, object, or topic);
second, two concepts are close to the extent that one is thought to affect the other (e.g. the
conceptual closeness between a verb and its object varies with the transitivity of the verb);
finally, two concepts are close to the extent that they are perceived as inseparable (e.g., there
is a closer conceptual link between a possessor and an inalienably possessed object than
between a possessor and an alienably possessed object).",[29]

direct speech and the infonnation flow i s extremely high. When that i s the case, Tail-Head
linkage is sometimes not used lest it would stop the flow of events"" (Van Kleef 1 988 : 1 52).
Although the (optional) absence of tail-head linkage in the climax of the Siroi narrative may
be a special Siroi phenomenon, the reason for this absence points to the general function of
tail-head linkage in managing the infonnation flow.
According to Foley ( 1 986:20 1 ), in most Papuan languages tail-head linkage is done by
subordinate recapitulatory clauses. In Kombai and Wambon, however, the nonnal way to
express tail-head linkage is by coordinate-dependent clauses. In Kombai and Wambon ,
switch-reference is restricted to coordinate clauses. By using coordinate structures for tail­
head linkage, the switch-reference monitoring of subjects is carried over sentence­
boundaries: the repeated verb occurs in a coordinate-dependent clause and accordingly
expresses switch-reference. The last verb of the preceding sentence, being an independent
fonn, does not express switch-reference but its recapitulated fonn in the frame clause does
express switch-reference.
In lrianese Indonesian, at least as it is spoken in the area where I have worked (see
Chapter 1 ), tail-head linkage also occurs, often in combination with the Irianese Indonesian
coordinator/sequence marker baru:(297)Kemarinsaya lihat babi hutan.yesterday I
see pig jungle
Yesterday I saw a wild pig.","[80, 81]"
"I
go.INF.NF-TR-CONN reluctant
I do not want to go.
The connective 0 links the infinitival complements to the verbal head of the clause in (382)
and to the adjectival head of the clause in (383).
-Although it is possible to express negative intention without quotation-forms (as in (382)­
(383)), negative intention may also be expressed with direct quotation and that is the most
frequent way of expressing negative intention. Thus, of (384) and (385), the preferred
option seems to be (385):
(384)Obatemi-n-olome-ge.medicine drink.INF.NF-TR-CONN refuse-3SG.NF
He refuses to drink the medicine.
(385)Obatemi-n-olome-def-e-ne.medicine drink.INF.NF-TR-CONN refuse-ISG.NF-CONN-QUOTE
He refuses to drink the medicine.
We may conclude that, when intender and intended are the same, the use of direct quotation
is not obligatory in all cases. With ftrst person intenders, quotation is not used (cf. (377)­
(378)), except for purposive constructions with motion-verbs (cf. (379)). For second/third
person intenders, quotation is obligatory with positive intention but with negative intention
lexical means are available that do not involve direct quotation (cf. (382)-(383)), although
even in that case the form using direct quotation (example (385)) seems to be the preferred
option.
These facts point to the tendency in Kombai to use direct quotation not only when
intender and intended differ but also when they are the same. This is because there is, from
the Kombai point of view, an act of communication involved both when intender and98
intended differ and when they are the same, although in this last case perhaps in a weaker
sense: in that case the intender communicates with himself, in 'inner speech'.
6.3.2 OTHER TYPES OF REPORTED THOUGHT
Because direct quotations form an obligatory part of the morpho-syntax of certain types of
intentional constructions, they have been, to a certain extent, grammaticalised in the domain
of intentionality. In the domain of reported speech (see section 6.3. 1 ), they have been
grammaticalised completely. By grammaticalisation of direct quotation I mean that it must be
used in certain construction-types independent of discourse-factors.
When other (non-intentional) types of thought are portrayed with direct quotation,
discourse-factors crucially determine this use. Consider the following examples:
(386)biiriiKhe reramaai-f-e-ne.he be.glad.3SG.NF territory go-ISG.INT-CONN-QUOTE.SG
He is glad to go to his own place.
(387)Yaimimo kharabuma-nothey allkhe fenemorabe.astonished-3PL.NF hehowma-khe-y-e-ne.do.3SG.NF-Q-TR-CONN-QUOTE.SG
They were all astonished because of the things he did.
(388)Yafo-finawa-khumolei-neno.their-thought COM-die.3SG.NF-QUOTE.PL
They think he is dead.
The various kinds of mental processes are indicated in the quotation-margins of (386)-(388).
The noun fina in (388) means 'breath' , but also ' thought' and 'desire' ; the verb finage- 'to
think', 'to long for' is derived with the verbalising support-verb -khe from the noun fina (see
section 3. 1 .2.3). This verb can be used both as an experiential and as a non-experiential
predicate. Compare:
(389)Yaokh-ofinii-ge.they water-CONN desire-3SG.NF
They are thirsty.
(390)Nagu momof-ofinii-ge.uncle-CONN desire-3SG.NF
we
We long for our uncle.
(39 1 )Khomofene finii-geno-n-apesawa meda-ne-madii.think-3PL.NF-TR-DS.and plane
person that
Those people think that the plane will not come.come-INF.F-NEGThe subject person-number argeements in (389) and (390) indicate the experiential nature of
these clauses: the verb does not agree with the experiencer. Literally, (390) says: '(It) desires
us of uncle'. In this way the experiencer is portrayed as not controlling the mental process
(de Vries 1989: 1 40, 141). The verb finiige- is used as a non-experiential verb in (39 1), in
which it agrees with kho mofene 'those people' who are portrayed as controllers of the99
mental process. Finiige- and fibima- 'to think' have their second arguments expressed in the
final clause of a co-subordinate clause-linkage. Consider:
(392)Yafibima-no-n-akhe gabiilche.they think-3PL.NF-TR-DS.and he
They think he is angry.angryThe second argument-clause khe gabiilche 'he is angry' in (392) is not embedded in the
preceding medial clause containing fibima- ' to think' . The switch-reference (Different
Subject) co-subordinator -a links the two clauses. We shall return below to this use of 'co­
subordination' .
The choice between using direct quotation (examples (386)-(388)) or co-subordination
(examples (391 )-(392)) for expressing non-intentional thought seems to be determined by
pragmatic factors. I do not pretend to have understood these factors fully and I limit myself
to sketching one type of context which triggers the use of direct quotation.
We find this .context when in narrative discourse the mental processes occurring in
participants are portrayed as mental reactions to the event of the narrative. Consider (393):
(393)Wa, fenemora yana-lufe-khakhu-do.oh, how
they my-word NEG-listen.INF.NON-F-NEG
He was perplexed that they did not listen to him.
The example (393) is the last sentence of a short narrative in which the main participant tries
to teach in his native village but the village people, to his surprise and disappointment, reject
him. Then (393) follows, without any quotation-margin (even the quotation-marker is
absent), to portray the thoughts of surprise and disappointment occurring in the main
participant. For the Kombai listeners to this story, it is very clear from the preceding context
what the encoding situation for (393) is, that is, whose 'inner speech' is quoted. The
function of the direct quotation in the story is clear to the Kombai listeners because they are
familiar with the narrative convention of portraying mental reactions by direct quotations. If
there occurs a verb in the quotation-margin in such narrative contexts, it is usually a verb of
thinking or feeling, often with emotional colour, like kharabuma 'to be astonished' in (387).
Literally, (387) says: 'They were astonished, ""how does he do it?""'. The same type of
narrative context of emotional participant-reaction triggers direct quotation in Western Dani
(Larson 1984) and there we also find exclamative interjections (like wa in (393)) initially in
the quotation and verbs of emotion in the quotation-margin.
6.4 FACTORS FAVOURING TIIE USE OF DIRECT QUOTATION
It should be clear by now that direct quotation plays an important role in the syntax and
discourse of Kombai. In this section, I shall, very tentatively, sketch two factors which may
be relevant to the frequency of direct quotation and its use in a wide range of construction­
types.
6.4. 1 SPECIFICITY OF EVENT-DESCRIPTION
Foley ( 1986: 1 13- 128) describes a tendency in the verbal semantics of Papuan languages
which may be relevant to the use of direct quotation in Kombai. This tendency is to be very
specific in the description of events, by breaking down actions into their component acts and1 00
express each one of these components by a separate verb (Foley 1 986: 1 1 3). An extreme but
illuminating example is from Kalam:
(394)mon pkYad amdapay-p-yn.go wood hit hold come put-COM-ISG
I fetched flrewood.
For Kalam, to be sure, (394) is not at all extreme: to leave out any of the verbs would make
the description seem incomplete to Kalam speakers.
This tendency to spell out the sub-events of an event in detail manifests itself also in
Kombai. For example, the event of 'going' is usually described as follows:
(395)Khe raganemaro-Ja-rakha.he rise.SS go.up-stand-SS .and go. 3SG.NF
He went away.
Some other examples:
(396)Dunoro fali-me.carry-come.3SG.NF
food
He brought food.
(397)Foromoja-ma-none!carry.SS go-down-come-IMP.PL
Bring it (down)!
The events of bringing and taking are always described as a combination of 'carry ' and
'come'/'go'. Often (as in (397)) there is also a motion-verb specifying the direction.
Now when an event has a speech-component, Papuan languages tend to make explicit this
speech-element by a verb of speaking and in Kombai this triggers the use of direct
quotations. Since, from the Kombai point of view, mental events like 'think' and 'want' also
imply speech ('inner speech'), the explicitation of this element of speech triggers direct
quotation in those domains, too.
6.4.2 PREFIELD COMPLEXITY IN A RIGID VERB-FINAL LANGUAGE
The second factor which may help to explain the importance of direct quotation in Kombai
is a syntactic one and has to do with constituent ordering tendencies in language.
Kombai is a rigidly verb-flnal language with the basic functional pattern S 0 V. Now
subordinate clauses are complex constituents syntactically (Dik 1978:204-212) and several
supposedly universal tendencies conspire to remove these complex constituents from the pre­
verbal area of the clause (prefleld) and position them after the verb (in the postfleld). For
example, the Prefleld Complexity Principle formulated by Dik ( 1989: 50): ""The Prefleld is
universally less hospitable to complex material than the Postfleld; Prefleld languages may
thus be expected to possess strategies for relieving the Prefleld of excessive complexity."".
Another tendency is that ""Other things being equal, constituents prefer to be placed in order
of increasing complexity"" (Dik 1989 :35 1).
Thus subordinate clauses in a rigid verb-flnal language like Kombai are subjected to
conflicting ordering pressures. On the one hand the language tends to adhere to its basic
functional pattern with the predicate (whether verbal or nominal) in flnal position. On the101
other hand, the aforementioned tendencies put pressure on the pre-verbal complex constituent
to move to the area after the verb.
There is no problem for topical subordinate clauses in Kombai. They go to the special
clause-initial position (P I in the terminology of Dik 1 989), reserved, inter alia, for
constituents with topical functions. This position is insensitive to complexity-pressures (Dik:
1 978 :204). Focus-clauses do not go to PI in Kombai; their focality is expressed by the
focus-clitic -a on the relational headnoun (see section 3.8.3.2. 1).
But not all subordinate clauses are topical in Kombai (see section 5.2.3.3). An important
class of non-topical subordinate clauses are the second argument-clauses of verbs of
speaking, thinking and wanting and of perception-verbs ('to see', 'to hear').
It follows from the ordering theory of Dik: ( 1989) that Kombai should possess strategies
to solve the conflict of verb-finality and pre-verbal complexity. One solution would be to
reduce the complexity of pre-verbal subordinate clauses, instead of postponing them. As in
the majority of rigid verb-final languages (Dik: 1989:378), the Kombai strategy of reduction
is to give pre-verbal embedded clauses a nominalised form. Consider (398) and (399):
(398)Nu lcha-n-o
biduma-de.
I
go.INF.NF-TR-CONN refuse-ISG.NFI do not want to go.
(399)Yauwarakhuma-noroemuma-no.they money pay-3PL.NF thing forget-3PL.NF
They forgot to pay.
The examples (398) and (399) represent the two forms that embedded pre-verbal clauses take
in Kombai. The first (such as in (398)) is with a nominal infinitive linked by the prefield­
centre connective -0 to its head, the verb of the superordinate clause. The second and more
usual form is to express the subordinate clause as a relative clause modifier of a relational
head noun, the two most common head nouns being ro 'thing' and rumu 'person' (cf.
Chapter 5). Thus (cf. (399)) embedded clauses take the form of noun phrases containing
relative clauses. Noun phrases are less complex than fully verbal embedded clauses (Dik
1989:3 5 1 ).
However, nominalised non-topical clauses (such as (398) and (399)) are relatively
infrequent and this is because Kombai prefers two other strategies, direct quotation and co­
subordination. These two strategies give the complex constituent a non-embedded syntactic
status so that it is no longer a constituent of the superordinate clause.
Let us limit our attention to clausal second arguments ('object clauses'). The great
majority of these clauses are expressed by direct quotation and/or co-subordination.
Verbs of speaking use direct quotation for their clausal second arguments:
(400)Khe luwarigayademo-nane-ne.he say.3SG.NF stone collect-IMP.PL-QUOTE.SG
He told them to collect stones.
Direct quotation-clauses are deictically not integrated in the clause of the quotation-margin
and syntactically only very partially. Therefore, for example, in (400) it is no problem that
the clausal second argument of luwa occurs after the verb. The speech act verbs preceding
and following the quotation merely 'bracket off' that constituent from the quotation-margin.","[107, 108, 109, 110, 111]"
"Question-words, Res and adverbial clauses are expressed as modifiers of relational HNs.
Ro and rumu are the most important of these HNs. This way of expressing theseconstructions follows from the preferred expression for terms in Kombai, which is predicted
by the PEM for terms (see section 5 . 1 ). In subordinate clauses, the verb is not the target for
formal adjustment to the PEM for terms. Instead, HN-insertion takes place, giving the90
embedded predication, which functions as a referring expression, as term, a nominal head, at
the same preserving the verbal expression of the embedded predication.
As in many other Papuan languages, RCs and adverbial clauses are formally very similar
in Kombai. This follows from their common functionality as terms.
RCs, adverbial clauses and question-words are terms; now when these terms have TO as
their HN they are used to refer to non-human entities and when they have rumu as their HN,
they are used to refer to human entities. Adverbial clauses with TO as their HN (the majority
of Kombai adverbial clauses has TO as their HN) are used to refer to states of affairs (events);
thus states of affairs, in specific conditions like topicality, are classified as non-human
entities. This use of TO in adverbial clauses confirms the insight of Lakoff and Johnson
( 1980) that the ontological metaphor ""Events are Things"" is operative in language. The
primary theory conceptualisation (in the sense of Horton 1982) of entities versus processes is
reflected in language by the distinction terms versus predications but languages are free, for
pragmatic purposes, to re-classify events as things in certain contexts. Ro 'thing' is the
central expressive device for this pragmatic re-classification of events as things in Kombai.
,Ro and rumu are relational nouns. This means that they belong to a transitional category
which stands in between the category of purely grammatical elements and the category of
purely lexical elements. Rumu functions both as a lexical predicate and as a relational noun;
TO functions only as a relational noun but there are signs that TO is becoming a functor in
subordinate clauses.","[99, 100]"
"The clitic -Ia 'self' which is used in reflexive forms of the personal pronouns (see section
3.3), sometimes also marks focus:
(253)Khane-ra
kh wui fa.
Khane-FOC theft do. 3 S G.NF
Khane has stolen.",[64]
"In (202) we see the demonstrative mofene as a modifier in a NP (see section 3.5. 1). In (20 1 )
w e see this demonstrative a s the head of a time phrase meaning 'then' a n d in (200) a s the
head of a locative phrase meaning 'there' . Demonstratives take over much of the functional
load of spatio-temporal adverbs in Kombai. Since the adverbial function of mofene is not the
only function of that word (it also and primarily functions as a modifier in NPs), the
definition of adverbs given above rules mofene out.
S i milarly, dependent verb forms with the support-verb -ma take over much of the
functional load of manner adverbs. With the support-verb -ma, verbs may be productively
derived from adjectives (see section 3. 1 .2. 1 ). The SS stem-only dependent form of these
verbs are very frequently used to express manner. (203) and (204) are examples of such verb
forms expressing manner.
Adverbs do not have a fixed position in the clause. Their position is determined by two
factors. In the first place, Kombai being a verb final language, there is the restriction that the
adverbs occur before the predicate, in the prefield of the clause. Secondly, the semantic
factor that the adverbs tend to occur following or preceding the constituent with which they
are most closely associated semantically.",[55]
"Finally, (299)-(302) also demonstrate the role of tail-head linkage in carrying switch­
reference over sentence-boundaries.
In (300) the 'headman's wife' is introduced into the discourse. In (30 1 ) this topic is re­
established by the topic marker mene (see section 3.8.3.2.2). In (302) this 'headman's wife'
topical span continues, together with the 'headman' topical span, started in (299). In (302)
both topics are only identified by verb morphology (switch-reference, agreements). This type
of weak identification by verb morphology is in many Papuan languages a preferred
identification strategy. Although these languages have sets of personal pronouns, these are
hardly used to maintain topicality.
Now in (302) this preferred identification strategy can be continued over sentence­
boundaries because of tail-head linkage: the last verb of (30 1 ), ufa, is an independent verb
form, not expressing switch-reference. B ut the recapitulated form Mana in (302) is a DS73
fonn, indicating that the next clause khumora ' she became unconscious' has a different
subject than iifana. Since in (302) there are only two topical participants activated, the
addressee easily identifies the 'headman's wife' as the one who became unconscious.","[82, 83]"
"The three stative verbs ba- 'to sit, to be' , lei- ' to be, to lie' and le- 'to be, to stand' are
classificatory verbs in the sense that size and shape of the entity denoted by the first argument
of the stative verbs, determine which of the three stative verbs should be used. Small entities,
like cucumbers and snakes always 'lie ', big entities 'stand' when they are tall and high, like
trees and houses, but 'sit' when the vertical dimension does not dominate in the perception.
In the case of human beings, it depends on the position they are thought to be in. For
example in ( 1 34) the teacher is supposed to 'sit' in the house.

The Kombai verb luwa- 'to say' has the role of generic verb of speaking which ne has in
Mandobo and, most probably, Kombai -ne has developed into a reported speech marker
from this verbal origin. The plural form -neno consists of -ne and the 2/3 PL.NF ending -no
which now only signals plurality of quoted speakers. Similarly, the medial quote-marker
-nera contains the medial verb conjunction -ra. The optional connective -0 of Mandobo
corresponds to the -e which optionally but usually precedes the quotation-markers in
Kombai.
Having discussed the role and some formal aspects of quotation in reported speech, we
now turn to the function of direct quotation in reported thought.
6.3 REPORTED THOUGHT
Direct quotation-forms play an important role in the domain of reported thought, too.
Mental processes (intention, attitudes, emotions) are often portrayed as a form of speech,
'inner speech' a person directs to himself. Drabbe ( 1 950, 1 955,1957, 1 959) has already noted
that thought and motives are represented as quoted speech in languages of the Marind and
Awyu family. 1 6 Healey (1964:29) describes the use of quotative clauses in Telefol with ""to
say, think, see, know, feel"" and calls the use of direct speech forms for the expression of
non-verbalised thought ""direct cerebration"".
Formally, the quotation is the same whether used in reported speech or reported thought.
The difference between the two is optionally expressed in the quotation-margin by lexical
means. It is true that the generic verb of speaking cannot be used in certain reported thought
contexts but in other reported thought contexts this verb, luwa- 'to say, speak', is obligatory
(see examples (375)-(376) below). The verbs rerama- 'to be glad' (example (386» and
kharabuma- 'to be astonished' are examples of lexical means in the quotation-margin
indicating the type of mental process in reported thought-constructions. We may distinguish
between intentional thoughts and other (non-intentional) thoughts when describing the role of
direct quotation in reported thought.",[105]
"16For example Drabbe (1955: 1 33) on Marind: .. .Jet erop hoe men de gedachte, het molief weergeef tin de
directe rede."" (,Notice how the thought, the motive is represented by direct speech.'). Drabbe (1957:85)
on the Awyu language Aghu: ...numo-gh, aldus zeggen, betekent mer: aldus tot zichzelfzeggen, of: aldus
denken... "" ( ... numo-gh, to say thus, means here: to say thus to oneself, or: to think thus .. . ) .
""""''96
6.3. 1 IN'IENTION
The use of quotative elements and forms of 'to say' in intentional contexts is a very
common feature of Papuan languages (see Healey 1 964 for Telefol, Deibler 1 97 1 for
Gahuku, de Vries 1 989:30 for Wambon, Reesink 1984:2 1 6 for Usan, Foley 1 986: 1 56- 1 57
for an overview). Both direct and indirect quotation constructions play a role in intentional
contexts. Longacre ( 1972:84) reports the use of indirect quotes in Yes san-Mayo intentional
expressions: ""Thus in Yes san-Mayo, Intent is expressed in an Indirect Quote Sentence, e.g.
'She village will see, she said', meaning 'She intended to see the village ....
An important factor determining the use of quotations in intentional constructions is
whether intender and intended are the same or not (Foley 1986: 1 56). In (373), for example,
the intender (John) and the intended person (Mary) differ but in (374) they are the same:
(373)John wants Mary to leave(374)John wants to leaveAccording to Foley ( 1986), in (373) an act of communication between John and Mary is
essentially involved, from the point of view of Papuan languages. Indeed, when intender and
intended differ in Kombai, the use of direct quotation-forms is obligatory:
(375)Camate luwakhoyademo-nane-ne.head
say.3SG.NF person meet-IMP.PL-QUOTE.SG
The district head wants the people to come together.
(376)Guruyaluwa-nofuruma khakhe-nane-neno.teacher them say-3PL.NF well
listen-IMP.PL-QUOTE.PL
The teachers want them to listen well.
The verb of speaking luwa- is used in this type of intentional construction. Examples (375)
and (376) can be used to report speech and to report intention (thought).
When intender and intended are the same, the category of person is an important factor
determining the form of intentional expressions.
With fIrst person intenders, Kombai uses intentional verb-forms, without quotations:

"In (290) as for Paris is the theme; from this and Dik's other examples it IS clear that Dik's
themes also present a frame for the following predication. There are, however, also
differences between our frames and Dik's themes.
In the first place, the discourse-functionality that I attribute to frames, is absent in Dik's
treatise about theme. Secondly, for Dik ( 1 978) themes are necessarily predication-external
constituents, contrasting with Dik's topics which are always predication-internal. In my view
frames and topics occur both predication-externally and predication-internally and I formulate
the differences between topics and frames more in terms of their different roles in discourse­
cohesion.
The pragmatic rationale for the predication-externality of both frames and topics in certain
conditions, seems to be processing freedom. The speaker chooses a frame or topic before he
has decided on the form of the subsequent predication. That is why we often find pause­
phenomena with predication-external topics and frames, as Dik ( 1978: 1 36) also notes for his
(always) predication-external themes.
In Warnbon and Kombai, bu also in Usan (Reesink 1 984), this processing function,
reflected formally by predication-externality and pause-phenomena, is the only difference
between predication-internal and predication-external topics and themes. There are no other
formal or functional differences connected to predication-externality which would justify the
set-up of separate predication-external and predication-internal topics and themes.
Notice that in the case of predication-external and predication-internal focus in Wambon,
there are other differences involved (see de Vries 1 989:Ch.3); the predication-external focus
was functionally an exclamative and vocative focus and formally expressed by -0 and not by
-nde. These differences led me to set up two functions of focus for Wambon.
Of course, further typological research is badly needed to see to what extent in Papuan
and other languages predication-externality is connected to other pragmatic a d morpho­
syntactic differences.",[75]
"The head nouns in the questioned NP have primarily a grammatical function of supplying a
head for the questioned NP. Accordingly they have in the question-word context a
generalised gramm atical meaning and not their specific lexical content. All the nouns of ( 1 85)
have in the question-word context the same general meaning of 'person' , whereas in their
normal lexical use they all have their specific meanings (see de Vries 1 987 for a detailed
discussion of the specific meanings of the kinship-terms of ( 1 85)).
We find TO 'thing' and the 'person' nouns of ( 1 85) in this role of supplying a grammatical
head with a generalised meaning in relative and adverbial subordinate clauses also. In
Chapter 5 these clauses will be treated and the role that the head nouns play in them. Here we

"3.1 VERBS
Verbs are words which are inflected for switch-reference and/or tense. Verbs are the
unmarked fillers of the head of the predicate slot. When nouns or adjectives function as head
of the predicate, they constitute marked items which is expressed by (optional) copula­
support (see section 3.1.3.4 ) or by verbalisation (see section 3.1.2).",[24]
"DUR-come.3SG.NFThe example (401 ) could be paraphrased as: 'I saw and he was coming' , to give the reader a
rough idea of co-subordinate clause-linkage, but the purely coordinate rendering with 'and'
fails to indicate the type of dependency between the two clauses of (401 ) although it succeeds
in rendering the non-embedded nature of the relationship. The dependency of medial clauses
on the following final clause (independent clause) has to do with tense-mood and person­
number interpretation of the verb of the medial clause (these depending in varying degrees on
the verb of the final clause) and with switch-reference relations between medial and final
clauses. The different subject form feradefa 'I saw and different subject following' cannot
stand on its own.
In Telefol (Healey 1964:28-29) perception verbs like 'to see' take quotative clauses to
express the perceived event. However, the use of quotative clauses with perception verbs
contrasts with the other uses of quotative clauses in Telefol (Healey 1964 distinguishes four
types of quotative clauses, that is, saying, desiderative, direct imperative and naming). In
perception contexts the quotation marker kalaa appears which does not occur with the other
types of quotative clauses.
For reasons of available space we cannot elaborate here on co-subordination and we shall
limit our attention to the aspect of complexity. The combination of non-embeddedness and
dependency makes co-subordination ideally suited for solving the problem of verb-finality
and pre-verbal complexity. The complex constituent (e.g. the clausal second argument khe
bome in (40 1 )) occurs after the verb of perception but its independent syntactic status as a
final clause prevents violation of the SOV pattern: it is not a constituent of the preceding
medial clause. With some verbs, both the quotation and the co-subordination strategy may be
used (compare e.g. (388) and (391)) but usually either direct quotation (e.g. Jumma- 'to
promise') or co-subordination (e.g. fera- 'to see') is used for the second argument.
There are a few cases in the data where certain verbs of speaking (Juwa- 'to say, speak' ,
ja- 'to call ') have their second argument-clauses expressed by co-subordination and not by
direct quotation. The verbs of speaking have direct causative meanings which they do not
have when direct quotation is used:
(402)Nu bo-Juwa-na-n-aaiii-de.",[112]
"4.3.2 THE EXPRESSION OF FRAMES IN NARRATIVES
In the functional grammar theory (Dik 1 978), informational relations between constituents
are treated in terms of pragmatic functions. Besides pragmatic functions, like topic and
focus, there are semantic functions (agent, beneficiary, etc.) and syntactic functions (subject,
object).
A language expression is described on two levels:the levels of predication and of
expression. A predication is a non-linear representation of the expression in which for each
constituent there is a functional specification indicating which semantic, pragmatic and
syntactic functions have been assigned to these constituents. Expression-rules express these
functions in the form and order of constituents. These rules are triggered by the functional
specification in the underlying predication and form the link between the predication and its
expression.
Of all the functions specified in the predication, only a part receives formal expression in
the morpho-syntax of clauses and sentences: there are limits to the amount of functional
information to be coded morpho-syntactically.
The pragmatic function of frame is assigned to constituents which specify the setting or
background for the subsequent predication and which link this predication to the preceding
predication or the organising centre of the discourse-chunk. Just as the other functions,
frames are not always overtly expressed. Many languages have frame constructions, that is,69
constructions which intrinsically define a certain constituent as the frame. For example, in
English, the as for construction:

"The relator -khu is attached to all members of the coordination, as is the normal pattern in
Awyu-family languages (de Vries 1 986). We have never found -khu coordinating more than
two noun phrases; these phrases must have the same functional specification but structurally
they may differ slightly (see for example (220» .-khu has a number of functions, one of which is the coordination of nouns. B asically,

"Of course, the anaphoric way to connect sentences is one found all over the world.
Anaphoric locative frames like there or temporal frames like then are often used in English to
connect sentences. The verbatim repetition of tail-head linkage, and the frequency of this
linking device, are cross-linguistically rather marked. Papuan languages appear to prefer to
repeat information rather than point back to it. Of course, they also have the options of
anaphoric frames and generic verb linkage but tail-head linkage, especially in narratives, is
the first choice.",[84]
"Domo- is a -mo derived verb (see section 3. 1 .2.8) which, in its dependent form, functions
as modifier of the next verb.
The imperative positive has been discussed in section 3. 1 . 3 .3.4. 1 . 1 . Notice that the
imperative negative uses the future stem (e.g. ami- of mi- ' to drink ' ) whereas the imperative
positive uses the basic stem. (Compare the close relationship of future and imperative
negative in English, e.g. 'you shall not kill ').",[39]
"Relative clauses generally have two heads, a topical head (yare in ( 3 1 9)) and a grammatical
head (rumu in (3 1 9)). The relative term with its grammatical head (gamo khereja bogino
rum u in (3 19) functions as a restrictive apposition to the topical antecedent (yare in (3 19)).
Thus (3 19) literally has something like, 'the old man, the person who joins the work, is my
uncle ' in which the relative term ('the person who join s the work') presents background78
information which helps to identify the speaker's topical entity. The relative terms in the data
always seem to function in the domain of topicality but further research is needed to establish
whether relative terms are restricted to these topical contexts.
Now when in relative terms rum u is used as the grammatical head, the relative term refers
to a human entity and when TO is used the relative term refers to a non-human entity. Most
relative terms have either TO or rumu as heads but in the data we also have examples where
there is no grammatical head noun (e.g. (320» or where the topical antecedent is repeated as
the grammatical head of the relative term (e.g.(32 1 ) . Sometimes, rumu is replaced by
another noun from the set (323) which also plays a role in question-word questions. All the
members of this set mean 'person ' in the contexts of question-word questions and relative
clauses. Rumu is the unmarked choice of this set. (322) is an example of a relative term with
mogo 'person' as its head.

"Between fully verbal and fully nominal embedded predications, Dutch has a range of
intermediate constructions (described in Dik 1985a). Kombai does not have these options.
Only in purpose clauses with ri (cf. for example (343)), we find infinitival verb forms
instead of the independent verb forms we find in all other subordinate clauses. In many
languages we find infinitival forms in purpose clauses (Hopper & Thompson 1985). Kombai
infinitives (see section 3 . 1 . 3.5) are the least 'verby' of the Kombai verb system. But also in
these purpose clauses the nominal head of the construction is not the nominalised verb but
the relational HN rio
There are many questions still unanswered concerning the HN-insertion strategy that
Kombai follows to give the adverbial clause a nominal form according to the PEM for terms.
Is this cross-linguistically a marked type of formal adjustment? Does HN-insertion
frequently occur in Papuan languages?
It could be that for Papuan languages there is a sort of prototypical expression model for
predications, both dependent and independent, demanding that they be expressed by a verb­
centered and verb-final clausal form. Of course, embedded predications function as terms86
and there is the pressure for them to confonn to the PEM for tenns. Now HN-insertion in
Kombai adverbial clauses could be viewed as a strategy to satisfy both the preferred verbal
expression of predications and the preferred nominal expression of tenns: the ro noun as the
head of the tenn and the independent verb as the head of the clausal modifier (RC) modifying
this relational HN.","[95, 96]"
"The topic khekhorabo ' his wife' is re-established by mene in (258). Voorhoeve ( 1 965 : 1 53)
has described similar discourse functions for the Asmat speaker-related demonstrative alar
which is also used 'when something is mentioned which has already been spoken of, or is
presumed to be known to the listener' . This same discourse function (to mark givenness) is
observed by HemmiHi ( 1 989) for demonstrative pa 'that/there ' in Urim (Torricelli Phylum,
East Sepik) when it goes with noun phrases. Interestingly, pa in this capacity only marks
textual given ness, not situational givenness or shared background givenness (Hemmilii
1 98 9 : 62). Apart from marking textual givenness (previous mentioning), pa is used to
introduce new topics into the discourse and to mark emphasis and contrast (focal functions).",[65]
"In terms of form, adjectives can be defined as those words which take either the adjectival
suffix -khe (-ge after adjective stems ending in a nasal vowel) or the intensifier -rabo. Both
-khe and -rabo mark a word as belonging to the category of adjectives. -khe is semantically
neutral but -rabo has intensifying meaning:

"Ro, however, is in the process of losing its noun status and becoming a subordinator.
Indications for this development are the existence of longer and shorter forms, cliticisation­
phenomena and the behaviour of -0.
Ro is the shorter fonn of rofa. In the following example we find the longer fonn rofa:89
(357)Kho khumo-rabakha-rofa. . .die.SS-and DUR.go.3SG.NF-thing/SUB
When a man dies and goes away ...manThe longer form rofa occurs in one example combined with the causal subordinator -ede
'because':
(358)Khe-khino rerakhu rof-odefeanimadii.his-leg
swollen thing/SUB-because he. will.not.go
Because his legs are swollen, he cannot go.
In (358) rofa and -ede are combined, giving rofode (vowel-elision and vowel-harmony, see
section 2.3). Shortening of the forms of relationally used lexical items may indicate transition
into the functor class. Lexical items each have their own (in Kombai unpredictable) main
word stress but functors tend to be unstressed. The form reduction of relational nouns and
verbs follows this stress-reduction.
Postpositions/subordinators in Wambon and Kombai cliticise to the last word of the
nominal or clausal term they belong to. Now when shorter forms develop, we also see
cliticisation of the shortened relationally used lexical items, which shows that they are
developing into postpositions (i.e. functors):
(359)Milbokhe-refeanimadii.rain DUR.be. 3SG.NF-thing/SUB Lshall.not.go
If it rains, I shall not go.
In (359) ro, the shorter form, has cliticised to the last word of the adverbial clause in a
harrnonised form (re). Notice that the modifier-head connective -0 is absent in (359),
completing the picture of a relational noun becoming a functor expressing subordination.
In the contexts of question-words, however, the signs that ro develops into a functor are
absent, -0 is obligatory and there is no cliticisation. But there are longer and shorter forms
also in question-words. Sometimes we find narofo rofa instead of narofo 'what'. In Res we
have the same phenomena as in adverbial clauses.
When ro loses its noun-status in subordinate contexts (Re, adverbial clauses) but not in
question-word questions, we would have a split between ro as a classificatory HN
(relationally used lexical item) in question-words and ro as a marker of subordination.
However, since the signs of ro losing its noun-status in subordinate contexts are still weak, it
seems justified to present a unitary description of ro as a classificatory HN in question­
words, Res and adverbial clauses.
5.4 SUMMARY
Ro 'thing' and rumu 'person' are relational nouns functioning as classifying head nouns
in question-words, Res and adverbial clauses. Rumu also functions as a lexical predicate, as
kinship term meaning ' son'.","[98, 99]"

by or associated wi th foreigners; there are very many of these compounds. For example , khaJo means
'grass' but khwayi-khaJo 'foreigners grass' refers to the lawn commonly found around houses of
foreigners. Kunci is an Indonesian loan meaning 'key '; khwayi-kunci means 'key of the foreigners'.",[62]

"The endings after -nege- are the normal non-future endings but with the addition of an -e;
thus the normal non-future ending for 1 PL -defo becomes -defone in deictic verbs with
durative-past tense, with a transitional nasal. The normal zero-ending for the NON- 1 SG.NF
becomes -ne (transitional nasal + -e) and so forth.
Thus deictic verbs have a deictic prefix expressing place and a tense-dependent durative
suffix.
The deictic slot is filled by either me- 'here (where the speaker is) ' , related to the
demonstrative mene 'thislhere' , or the addressee-related mofekho- 'there' or the third person39
related deictic makho- 'there ' ; the addressee-related form mofene does not occur in deictic
verbs (see above); on the other hand mofekho- does not occur as a demonstrative modifier
but it does occur adverbially (mofekhone 'there').
All the nine possible combinations of time and place do occur: 'close to the speaker/before
utterance-time' , 'close to addressee/ at utterance-time' , 'far away (third person)/after the
utterance-time ' , and so on. For example:

The Kombai counting system is basically a body-part counting system. Thus the words
denoting certain parts of the human body have as second meaning the numbers. Body-part
tallying systems are common in New Guinea languages (Laycock 1 975). The Kombai
system is of the usual type which employs the fingers, parts of the arm and the head, that is it
does not use n amed points on the lower half of the body (Laycock 1975:220). 7
