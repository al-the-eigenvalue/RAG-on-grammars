For the remaining cases, it was not possible to establish a constantdifference in distribution between the A variant and the B variant.
The A variant was found in the vast majority of cases. Both forms
occur in identical or similar environments in which no difference in
meaning is discernible and it is thus probable that in these cases the
two variants can alternate freely :

"WORD-CLASSES201On the basis of the derivatives with -nakdp, secondary derivatives can
be formed with the suffix -iriw, which serves to emphas'ize the semantic
value of -nakdp :
j i k c slack ; jinitnakbp very slack ; jinitnakdpiriw very, very slack.
The only case of a secondary derivative with -ere that I came across
was pacdkasd ($ 202).
202Pacdk bad, unfit, has irregular derivatives: the suffix -up and -as
are added to pacdk instead of -nakdp and -nakds:These derivatives express intensity of feeling. Phcakdp is used to
express compassion, for example :
n d t pacakdp!
husband).my poor man! (said by a wife about a deformedPacdkapiriw and pac&kasere can be translated by : worthless, miserable,
deuced. This is the only case in which the derivative with - @ X w
indicates the singular number, in contrast to the derivative with -asere
which here indicates the plural number:
a ack pacbkapiriw !
that acir badthat colnfounded acir (store for sago on the collar beams of the house).a j d s pacakaserL /mimp manimcZ?ni/!
those names bad /I always forget/those deuced names, I always forget!
203The suffix -picim indicates a relative degree :

jiwinakdpiciw rather small
taripicim rather long agoTHE ASMAT LANGUAGE
Cases of transposition204The case of jvwinakdp small, of which the derivatives jiwinakdpnakdp
very small, jilvmakdpna kdpirvw very, very, small, and jiwinakdpicim
rather small, were found, has already been noted.
Probably the following case is also one of transposition (transposition
to the adjective class by suffixing - w h i p ) :nemsbnak@ slow

Cases of transposition191The one definite case of transposition I found is the word jiwinakap,
which occurs as a substantive with the meaning 'small child' (from
jiwi, child), and as an adjective with the meaning 'small"". This case
will be dealt with when the adjective is discussed.
Transposition to the class of substantives probably occurs in the
following cases :1. The adjectives a d large, and jhinakap small, occur in the following sentence in positions in which one would expect substantives
to occur :WORD-CLASSEStakds awakamkuruwior in, awut am, j i w h k a p am, takds in

2. cowdk 'one, very, forthwith' > cowakased 'little ones' (substantive).
cowdk is a word of which it is not yet clear to which word-class it
belongs. It can form groups with substantives, adjectives, and verbsl,
as in: cem cowdk one house; akdt cowdh very good; atepj4s coivdk
they forthwith rowed upriver.
The irregular derivative with -asere instead of -nakdsere (see 8 202)

Lastly, I will discuss three elements of which the function is still not
clear to me: m/un/un/d, am3, and aw.
NegationsOnly the following forms of the verb can precede negations :
1. the m-/mV- and the m-/mV-@ forms :
2. the tense and tense-aspect categories of verbs of which the core
contains the formative por == to wish, to try to. These verbal forms
only occur in combination with @k/pak, opO~s.l/powand @nakdw/
pZnakhw. These negations then express a contrariness which can be
translated by : but no, but in vain.opdk/paknot, withoutufidk and pak alternate freely, except after verbs with the formative
for, where opik always occurs. pak was usually found after the m-/mVand the m-/wtV-dji forms of the verb; in other cases op6k was usually
found.opdk/pak can form groups with :

m and pow is parallel to that of opdk and pak.
I could not find a distinct difference in meaning between o$hk/pak and
o p h / p o w . I got the impression from the examples to hand that the
relationship between opdk/pak and opow/pow is parallel to that
between the non-mood and the mood forms of the verb. opow/pow
was only found in direct speech, in sentences in which the speaker
gives expression to varying moods.
op6w/pow was found linked to :

"24THE ASMAT LANGUAGEwide departure from a smooth or undulating contour"".g By 'departure'
Bolinger means a deviation in a contour which then continues in the
- or
same pitch - ' or - -, as well as a sudden rise fall - , after which it continues on a higher or a lower level.
w i t h r e g a r d to Asrnat, it could be established that in most cases
the accent is accompanied by a clear and sudden rise or fall of the
pitch. Four cases can be distinguished :1. The accented vowel has a higher tone than the rest of the contour:2. The accented vowel has a higher tone than the contour preceding it :3. The accented vowel has a lower tone than the contour preceding it:---4. The accented vowel has a higher tone than the contour following it:It is clear that in 3, and 4 'pitch' alone does not determine the
accent. There must be other factors that cause the difference. Bolinger,
who describes a parallel case in English, attributes the determination
of accent in this case to different factors: context, phonetic reduction,
and contiguous 'unaccentables3.10 It is not possible, however, for me
to determine in how far similar factors are also active in Asmat This
would require special investigation.
There are also cases in which I noted accent without being able
to discern a deviation in the pitch by ear. In some of these cases it
could be established that the accented vowel was rather longer than
the contiguous non-accented vowels. It was often not possible, however,
to determine by ear what the accent-determining factors were.3-1
9Id. p. 112.","[35, 36]"
"PHONOLOGY15The possibility of this [a] occurring only in a consonantal environment in which the other vowels do not occur, is excluded by the
occurrence of word pairs, like the following:[Eam'en] = penis[Eem]
= house
[Eam'an] = space under the house
[turnran] = a burn
[Eim'in] = the temple (of the head)
[combfit] = sponge made of young sago leavesThe following minimal pairs were also found :
[csmren] penis; [cm/en] stem of a canoe;
[and'ow] mother ; [oncTow] thatch ;3
[&porfes]they saw him (from por - to see) ;
[&parfes] they sat (from ap - to sit).
Since [a] occurs in the accented as well as the unaccented position
in those cases in which it alternates with the other vowels, it is not
possible to regard it here as an allophone common to /a, e, i, o, u/
which is restricted to unaccented positions. Because [a] also occurs
without alternating with the other vowels, in which cases I found
some minimal pairs, it must be regarded as a phoneme be/. Cases
of alternation must be regarded as cases of phoneme alternation.
The phoneme / E / is then distinguished from the other vowels by
its different behaviour, and because it is the only vowel phoneme
without allophones.
19
To sum up one can say that the vowel phonemes form a system of
three contrasting tongue heights. At the highest level, there is a
contrast front - back /i - u/; at the middle level, a contrast front central - back /e - C - o / ; while at the lowest level only /a/ occurs:According to my informants, the word [ond'Gw] was used only by the people
who originated from the village of Kajt?. I had the impression that now only
the older people within this group use it. The younger people, as well as the
non-Kaj2 people in Suru, use the form [~nd'Gw].","[26, 27]"

Of these, only the personal possessive pronouns have morphological
valence ;WORD-CLASSES1432. there is one 'neutral' deictic word, q'w, which links up with all
three classes ;3. I n all three classes we find pairs of word-variants: one variant
ending in a vowel, the other in r.
The scheme makes it clear that there is a certain formal connection
between the classes: 1) because the deictic word a/ar belongs, to1 all
three classes; 2) because the same type of word-variants occurs in all
three classes.
Only with these deictic words do word-variants with and without
final r occur systeniatically : outside the deictic words, only a few
isolated cases were found.3611. The interrogative pronouns are ca/com, ucim and ucina.k/uci/uc.

235The interjections form a word-class characterized by :1. the absence of morphological and syntactical valence ;
2. the occurrence of special phonological phenomena ;
3. the breaking of the rules of phoneme distribution;
4. the breaking of the rules of accentuation.
The special phonological phenomena occurring with interj ections are :
word-final k
prolongation of vowels
laryngdization
the special sounds nj, 'm, ts, and pr.
These have already been dealt with in $$ 33-38.
The rules of phoneme distribution arc broken in that the vowel t? can
occur word-finally.
The rules of accentuation are broken in that, in specific cases, the
regular alternation of accented and unaccented vowels does not occur.
The interjections fall into two groups :1. exclamations ;
2. onon~atopoeicinterjections, and exclamations used to call animals
or to urge them on.
Exclamations
236The rules of phoneme distribution are only broken in this group.
Among others, the following cases were noted :
11162THE ASMAT LANGUAGEoh! alas!
oh! alas!

you are my husband, my dear one, my dearSome cases were noted in which a whole word-group was transposed
to the category of interjectio'ns. These cases are: the affectionate
expressioln nor m6 my husband, my dear one, and the abusive words :ekc6 jimd
n& minomonster ! misbegotten brat ! (arse child !)
weakling ! (piece of meat)Onomatopoeic interjections and words of command to animals
237The rules of accentuation are only broken in this group. A phenomenon
frequently occurring in this group is the repetition of the same element,
usually one having one vowel. In this case the alternation of accented
and unaccented vowels does not occur.

238I shall now deal with a number of words that have no rnorpho'logical
valence and which cannot yet be classified into a definite word-class
because the material is insufficient for this purpose. That I have,
nevertheless, divided them into negations and postpositions is due to
the fact that the negations, at least, have a feature common to them,
one which is not found in the postpositions : only specific forms of the
verb can occur before negations. The feature characteristic of the
postpositions is that they always occur at or within the end of a
word-group.43
The syntactical valence of the negations and postpositions, like that
of the interrogatives, is still not fully known to me. In so far as I have
been able to determine it with certainty will it be mentioned, and
examples will be given.
In additioln, cases will also be given of the occurrence of negations and
postpositions in sentences of which the syntactical structure has not
yet been determined.
The negations and postpositions will be dealt with in the following
order :11. The postpositions: on the basis of their function, these can be
divided into :
1. emphasizing words : arhÂ¥wnat, man
2. conjunctions : am, win, enerim/edm,
44
3. question markers : en/an, open/pen, am1
4. the dubitative marker : ew
5. the irrealis marker : a j
The only exception to this is en$rIwl/e~/ti~
which is always placed between
proper names.
44 There are still three other conjunctions : rn~.vi~zcrimfwiasnerim/maserittz/
mi.sZrtnz/masnim then; w&
again; mariw,/mar&w/Â¥~nart/ntar
- at last,
finally. These link word-groups with word-groups. These words will not be
discussed here because this is not possible without a previous investigation
into the syntax.","[175, 176]"
"^ Id. pp. 136, 137.
1-1 I n theabove mentioned article, Bolinger remarks that psychological factors
play a role in the interpretation of phonetic data as accent: data interpretable
as accent may be ignored by a person speaking his mother tongue, when they
occur in places where he knows from experience that there is no accent.
(p. 136, 137). This presents the possibility that, on the one hand, a linguistPHONOLOGYThe general principle of accentuation
40The general principle of accentuation is : there is a reqular alternation
of accented and unaccented vowels.
I n certain cases, however, sequences of two, at most three, unaccented vowels occur.
Furthermore, there are some cases of multi-vowelled onomatopoeia
in which no alternation of accented and unaccented vowels is found:

"WORD-MORPHOLOGYIntroductionIn this section the verbal forms which can be formed from the core
by the addition of prefixes and suffixes will be dealt with. These verbal
forms, together with the affixless cores, make up the system of verbal
categories. This system consists of 24 main categories 17 of which each
consist of a system of sub-categories. A survey of these 24 main
categories is given in the scheme on p. 68; the sub-categories are
here omitted.
The form of the scheme is determined by the following considerations :1. that the verbal cores are distinguished from all other verbal forms
by the absence of a categorial element of form. They can be saidWORD-CLASSES69to form a non-characterised category as opposed to1 to all other
categories, which are characterised.
I n the scheme: I and 11.
2. that the characterized categories fall into :
1. categories in which there are no sub-categories.
2. one in which there is a division into a number of object-categories; the verbal forms belonging to this category differ from
each other in the suffix indicating the object, e.g.,mo-por-c.&
look at me !
mo-por-c.aw@ look at us!3. one in which there is a division into a number of subjectcategories; the verbal forms belonging to this category differ from
each other in the suffix indicating the subject, e.g.,d-por-c.Ow
&por-c.ow&jdo1 look ! (sing.)
do look ! (plur.)4. a number of categories in which there is a division into a
number of subject categories and a number of object categories;
the forms belonging to these categories differ from each other in

"1 The core categoryKM
The cores form a category that is distinguished from all other a t e gories by the absence of a categorial element of form. Their common
semantic element is difficult to define on the basis of the 31 cases
I noted. Tentatively, it can be said that these cases fall into' two groups :
a. one comprising a number of cases in which the core seems to be
characterized by the absence of all other categorial meanings and only
relates to the action or the happening as such :

"+WORD-CLASSESThe morphological structure of the coreOnly provisional observations can be made here about the structure
of the core. The reason for this is that the main point of research, as
regards the verb, was an investigation into the verbal categories. An
insight into the structure of the verbal system proved to' be a prerequisite if I were to understand and to speak the Asmat language.
The relative independence of the core made it possible, temporarily
to leave its structure outside consideration. Since, however, research
into the verbal categories took most of the available time, there was
none left for a systematic examination of the cores. This remains one
of the most important tasks for future research.
Consequently, the paragraphs on co-re-structure, as well as the paragraphs on core-morphology, represent only a preliminary reconnaissance
in the field. The picture of the core-structure given here is for the
main part based on indirect information, i.e. information obtained from
an analysis of a specific corpus of verbal cores of which only a small
part was elicited from the informants with this analysis in view. This
corpus of verbal cores consists of 2 3,000 cores, of which Â±1.200
occur in the texts to be appended to this grammatical description.","[54, 55]"

"INTRODUCTION7where the investigation was later to be carried on. Mifekpic had even
spent part of his childhood there.
My relationship to the two boys developed from the outset on the
'anak piara' 12 pattern: they called me their 'father' and were regarded
as my 'children'. They were paid in cash for their assistance. They
were given a meal every day, and now and then some clothes and
tobacco. With their wages they could buy clothes, tobacco, and the
highly prized axes and chopping knives at the shop in Agats. The
relationship with these informants was a very good and personal one
throughout the whole undertaking. They worked with enthusiasm and
pleasure, apart from some unavoidable lapses.
Because the boys were still rather young, their knowledge of their
mother tongue, of tradition and of mythology was sometimes inadequate
for the translating of the folk tales I collected. The help of an older
man was then enlisted for the interpretation of mythological matters
and special usage. In addition, all the Asinat people with whom I conversed acted as informants. The information received from them was
always checked again with the regular informants.
The reason I chose two of the latter was primarily to enable me to
control the information given by the one by that provided by the other
and vice versa. Another reason was that the boys' capacity for work
was rather small, especially in the beginning - an hour at a stretch
was more than enough for them. Later, when they had been properly
trained, they could sustain a session of two hours or longer without
difficulty. No fixed scheme of questioning was followed at these
sessions. The discussion began on a particular subject and developed
as it went along, depending upon the mood of the informant. The boys
were never prevented from giving information spontaneously, even if
it were not relevant, but sometimes they had to be guided along a fresh
track back to the original subiect. If it became apparent that an answer
to a question about a particular matter was not forthcoming readily,
either because the boy did not understand me, or because he had had
enough, then it was put on one side. Later, a casual return to it often
produced good results. If one of them gave information on a subject
and it differed from that which the other had furnished, then these
variations were discussed in the presence of both of them. And sometimes it then became clear that they held differing opinions regarding
the pronunciation of particular wolrds, or their meaning.
12 The Indonesian word for foster-child,THE ASMAT LANGUAGE7 Tape recordingA portable tape recorder was used extensively for the collecting
of the language data and the music. Thus texts and music could always
be got without difficulty. Only once was I requested not to record
a sacred song. The Asmat people were delighted to hear their own
music reproduced. Western music meant nothing to them. They were
not much interested in the texts, though this did not alter the fact that
the audience always listened critically and expressed their disapproval
in a very positive fashion of any deviations from the version they knew.
The analysis of the texts collected appeared to be of great value for
an understanding of the language and it was through these that I came
upon the track of the special forms of the Asmat verb which express
varying moods.
The language of the folk tales would not appear to differ from
common usage. Asmat songs, however, have their own vocabulary
which is known only to the older people, particularly the singers.
These latter were, however, less inclined to be con~municativeabout
it to strangers.
8 Research in Ag-ats and JepemI began the investigation at Agats, but since Agats was completely
outside the sphere of Asmat society - it was a 15-minute walk from
Surh - I decided, once I had surmounted the first difficulties of the
language, to continue it in one of the Asmat villages in the vicinity
of Agate. By living amidst the Asmat people I would be able quietly
to observe the way in which Asmat society functioned and would
become acquainted with the people and their language. Surfi was less
suitable as a place in which to stay because the presence of the Government and the Missions had to a certain extent already influenced the
way of life there. The village of Jepkm, where both my informants
had relatives, appeared to be the most suitable, and from May, 1961,
the investigation was carried on from there, interrupted from time
to time by a short sojourn in Agats.
During the period of my stay in the Asmat region, the Dutch scholar,
Dr. A. A. Gerbrands, and the American student D. B. Eyde, were
also there: the former doing research into Asrnat art, similarly under
the auspices of W.O.N.G., and the latter doing ethnological field work.
Their presence was of great value in acquiring as good an insight asINTRODUCTION9possible into Asmat culture. Many were the pleasurable and stimulating
discussions we had when we were together, either in the house of
the W.O.N.G. in Agats or at the 'Wong Club', as Dr. Gerbrands'
house in the village of Amhamkaj was called. During the last year,
a lively correspondence on mythological and linguistic subjects was
kept up with Eyde. A knowledge of mythology seemed to be of the
greatest importance for acquiring an insight into Asmat culture, and
it was for this reason that I put as many tales as possible on the tape.
I collected approximately 80 texts, but these represent only a fraction
of the wealth of stories the Asmat people know.","[18, 19, 20, 21]"

"THE ASMAT LANGUAGEto Asmat, KAn~oroand Skmpan, are spoken. These two languages
cover the whole coastal area between the Rivers Opa and Otakwa.
Between the Otakwa and the MomAc, where the Asmat language-area
begins, there are no villages. Nothing is known about the languages
to the north and the north-east of the Asmat language-area : in the east
and the south-east, Asmat meets up with the Awju and Jakaj languages,
which are probably not related to Asmat.3
Asmat has various dialects, but a systematic investigation into them
has not yet been made, so that little is known about the nature and
extent of the dialectical variations. Broadly, Asmat dialects can be
divided into a central group of little differing dialects with, around it,
on the periphery of the Asmat language-area, a number of dialects
differing sharply from it: those spoken upstream of the Rivers Pomiic
(Noordwest), Unir (Lorentz) and Sirkc, and the dialect of the
Casuarinen Coast.
8 The terrain, the people, the concept of their worldThe area in which the Kiimoro, Skmpan and Asrnat languages are
spoken consists mainly of a marshy, low-lying, thickly wooded plain,
intersected by countless rivers and streams of which a noteworthy
feature is the ebb and flow of the tide far into the hinterland. The
climate of the region is very humid and the rainfall abundant approximately 225 inches a year. The terrain is very heavy going on
foot, so the canoe is the usual means of transport. I t is used extensively.
One can go everywhere along the natural network of waterways by
canoe and people can thus move about easily and can cover great
distances.
The Asmat people dwell in villages situated along the rivers. The
The data on the Kamoro and Sempan languages are taken from P. Drabbe,

less than 100. The total Asmat population is estimated to be 40,000
persons. The people of the central Asmat region call themselves &mat
ow.which probably means 'tree peoplej.4
According to the Asrnat people, the territory they inhabit, the b a t
capmmi, is enclosed within, and lies at the bottom of, a gigantic
coconut: their world is not convex but concave.5 The boundaries of
their world correspond roughly to those of their language-area between the Casuarinen Coast and the Mimika Coast (where Kimoro
is spoken). And one can do' the 'journey round the world' by setting
out from the Casuarinen Coast, crossing the stretch of water between
it and the Mimika Coast, landing there, and then returning to the
Casuarinen Coast. Through the middle of this world flows the great
River Sirkc, rising far away, somewhere at the top of the coconut,
close to the holy entrance to the upper world (the outside world).
From this opening, in prehistoric times, the heavenly beings descended
to earth, in order to populate the world with their descendants.

always placed before it, or always behind it;
3. they add to the core a specific semantic element ;

II T H E VERBIntroduction
63From the preceding survey of the morphological processes, it is42THE ASMAT LANGUAGEclear that the word-class of the verb is distinguished from the other
word-classes by the fact that all these processes occur within it, whereas
outside the word-class of the verb only suffixation and composition
occur.
Of the morphological processes which occur only within the wordclass of the verb, only prefixation can occur with all verbs, and
therefore, is characteristic of the verb as a whole: an Asmat verb could
be defined as a word which is, or can be, prefixed.
The mo~rphologicalstructure of the verb which is often very complicated, in comparison to the structure of non-verbs, makes it necessary to divide the description of the verb into three parts:1. a general survey of the morphological structure of verbal forms
and of the relation between the core-morphology and the wordmorphology of the verb ;
2. the core-morphology ;3. the word-morphology.
General survey of the structure of verbal formsCore and peripheral part
64Within the verb, two parts can be distinbuished which are to a certain
degree independent of each other, namely :1. a central part, which will be termed the core of the verb ;
2. a peripheral part.
The verbal core can be monomorphematic or polymqhematic. The
peripheral part consists of prefixes and/or suffixes added to the core.
The mutual independence of the core and the peripheral part shows
itself in a difference in internal organization which makes a separate
description of the two parts necessary.
Their mutual dependence shows itself in the fact that: a. a verb
consists either of a core, or of a core
peripheral part, but never of
a peripheral part alone; and b. there are a number of verbal categories
that do not occur with cores ending with the morphemes iturn, es, it
or u w e ~(see 5s 91-94).","[53, 54]"

em can mean 'to stand' as well as 'to cause to be stood up, to put
down' (of a 'standing' object)
amis, to lie, does not occur with the meaning 'to lay, to put down'

"Finally, I treat as a prefixed formative the element which is added
to the root by the process of (rejduplication. I n all cases I noted, this
process consists of the repetition of the first two phonemes of the
underlying form. If this form consists of only two phonemes, the
result is duplication.
Reduplication, or duplication, indicates that the action is repeated a
number of times, or that the action is itself repetitive.

"Although these variants appear to alternate freely, there is a clear
distinction as to their frequency, which is determined by the speed
of speaking : the variant having this vowel occurs mostly in deliberately
slow speech, whereas the variant in which this vowel is absent, occurs
mostly in normal or quick speech.
61I n addition to the preceding cases a number of isolated cases of free
variation were noted. I n these cases the same formal difference was

found here ; sometimes both possibilities were found alongside each
other, sometimes only one of them, for instance, I noted:
from f o r 'to see' : xa6-por and md-for;
from fis 'to come inside' : always mi-fis ;
from ni 'to return home7: always md-n-i.

133Modal suffixes : -car/-ca, -war/-am/-ar/-a :
formal : -car in all cases, except in forms 1. and 2. where -cu occurs.
informal : in all forms, except 1. and 2. : -arar, but after the core-final
r : -ar.
In forms 1. and 2. : -am, but after the core-final r : -a.
As in the conditional forms, the contrast formal-informal, does not
occur with cores ending in a w h . After aw&, only -or and -a occur.","[100, 101, 102, 103]"

An adjective precedes the substantive when a certain emphasis falls
on the former:

"80THE ASMAT LANGUAGEsimilar suffix is absent in the form of the object category I. Object
category I is here characterized by the absence of an element of form
which is correlated with the categorical meaning. In a case such as this,
we can say that the object category is characterized by zero.
If we compare the form an-; with the other forms of the paradigm,
then we see that here the modal suffix c is absent: the imperative is
therefore characterized by zero. Besides an-i, the form with modal
suffix -c, a d c then occurs: here, the modal suffix -c alternates
with zero.","[91, 92]"
