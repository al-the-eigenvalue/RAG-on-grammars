English-Southern Sierra Miwok221
299INTRODUCTION
Southern Sierra Miwok is a member of the Miwok family of languages of Central California. It belongs to the
Eastern division of Miwok, together with Central Sierra, Northern Sierra, Plains, and Saclan. The three Sierra
languages are more closely related to each other than to either Plains or Saclan. The internal relationships of
the Miwok family can perhaps be most clearly stated in a chart, as follows (Broadbent and Callaghan, 1960):
A. Eastern Division
1. Sierra
la. Southern Sierra
lb. Central Sierra
lc. Northern Sierra
2. Plains
3. Saclan
B. Western Division
1. Coast
la. Bodega
lb. Marin
2. Lake
Except for Saclan, added by Beeler (1955, 1959), the Eastern languages were named and geographically
defined by Barrett (1908). Previous suggestions on similar lines had been made by Kroeber (1906) and
Merriam (1907).
The historic territory of Southern Sierra was roughly equivalent to modern Mariposa County. Kroeber (1923,
facing p. 446) shows it as more or less triangular in shape. He places the boundary with Central Sierra
between the Merced and Tuolumne Rivers. To the south, he draws the Yokuts-Mono boundary along the
Fresno River, continuing the line northeastwards between the watersheds of the Merced and San Joaquin
Rivers up to the crest of the Sierra Nevada, the eastern limit of all the Sierra Miwok groups. He places the
western boundary, with Yokuts groups, at the beginning of the foothills.
Informants living today know very little about the ancient boundaries of their language. One informant placed
the western limit on a line running through Merced Falls, Hornitos, Toledo, and Indian Gulch, a few miles
east of Kroeber's boundary. He gave Ahwahnee as the southeast limit. All informants were more or less sure
that the village of /?apa•ša?/ or /?apa•šaw/ near Oakhurst was Yokuts, in agreement with Kroeber (1923, p.
482: ""Hapasau""). However, one individual spoke of a village called /hicwe•ta?/. about three miles west of
Oakhurst, as having both Yokuts and Miwok inhabitants, and said that there were some Miwok at Coarsegold,
which is assigned by Kroeber to Yokuts territory. Since the Miwok do not appear to have recognized any
DICTIONARY8The Southern Sierra Miwok Language (1964), by Sylvia M. Broadbent
political entities larger than the village or local group, a certain haziness about boundaries is understandable.
Moreover, they seem to have been on good terms with their Chuckchansi (Yokuts) neighbors at least, and
there was probably considerable intermarriage between villages near the limits of their respective linguistic
groups. Such villages would naturally contain speakers of both languages.
Kroeber (1923, p. 445) suggests 9,000 as a liberal estimate for the population of the Sierra and Plains groups
combined, allowing slightly more than 2,000 for each group. He states, however, that there is no specific
information on aboriginal population figures. He lists 109 locateable Eastern Miwok villages. A total
population of 9,000 would give an average population of only 82.5 persons for the villages listed, and his
village list is obviously incomplete, since it includes only those which he could locate. The addition of more
villages, while accepting his total estimate, would lower the average village population still further. It seems
likely, then, that 9,000 is none too generous an estimate.
There are now only about twenty more or less fluent speakers of Southern Sierra, none below middle age.
Only four individuals are known to use the language commonly in daily conversation. It seems probable that
by 1980 the language will be extinct, except for stray words remembered by people who never spoke the
language fluently.
The three Sierra Miwok languages are structurally very similar. The principal differences between them are
phonetic, especially in the spirant series, and lexical. Speakers of Southern Sierra claim that they cannot
understand Central or Northern. As Barrett suggested in 1908, there are some dialect differences within
Southern Sierra. At this late date, very little can be determined as to the nature of these differences, since so
few speakers remain. However, there was clearly some divergence between the speech of individuals from
Yosemite, those from the vicinity of Mariposa, and those from the extreme southern limit of Miwok territory.
Occasional lexical items are different, and Yosemite speech may have had an additional spirant phoneme, /s./,
which is lacking in the others. Spanish loan-words sometimes occur in differing forms in these three areas.
Speakers from Mariposa say that they can hardly understand those from Yosemite, only forty miles away.
The best previous work on these languages is Freeland's grammar (1951). It is based primarily on Central
Sierra, but includes references to structural differences between Central, Northern, and Southern. It is a good
and reasonably complete grammar; in fact, it is one of the best in print on any California language. However,
it was written fifteen year: before it was published, and is somewhat outdated in certain respects, especially
with regard to phonology. Some sample texts were included, but there was no dictionary; for Central Sierra,
this deficiency has since been filled, with the addition of more texts (Freeland and Broadbent, 1960).
Although these works provide adequate coverage of Central Sierra, separate treatment of the other Sierra
languages is still highly desirable the more so in view of the advances in techniques of linguistic analysis that
have taken place since Freeland's grammar was written.
No exhaustive ethnography of the Miwok has ever appeared. Perhaps the most useful single work is Barrett
and Gifford's study of Miwok material culture (1933). Kroeber (1923, pp. 442-461) gives a good genera
summary of Miwok culture. It was among the Sierra Miwok that the exogamous moiety system was first
discovered in California (Gifford, 1916). In addition, some studies of Miwok mythology have appeared
(Barrett, 1919; de Angulo and Freeland, 1928; Gifford, 1917).
The fieldwork on which the present study is based was conducted under the auspices of the Survey of
California Indian Languages (Department of Linguistics, University of California, Berkeley) during the
following periods: August 24 to September 14, 1955; June 26 to September 10, 1956; June 28 to September 4,
1957; July 2 to September 7, 1958; and July 7 to July 28, 1961. My informants were as follows:
Chris Brown (Chief Leeme), of Bootjack (CB, deceased November 1956)
Alvis Brown, of Bootjack (AB)
INTRODUCTION9The Southern Sierra Miwok Language (1964), by Sylvia M. Broadbent
John Lawrence, of Tiptop (JL, deceased 1957)
Bill Bolton, of Bootjack (BB)
Castro Johnson, of Mariposa (CJ)
Rose Watt, of Usona (RW)
Emma Lord, of Usona (EL)
Benjamin (Banjo) Graham, of Ahwahnee (BG)
Elizabeth (Lizzie) Graham, of Ahwahnee (LG)
Charlie Bohan, of Ahwahnee (CR)
Chief Leeme (/limi•/, 'ripples on the water') was my principal informant during 1955 and 1956, and the
phonemic analysis is based largely on his idiolect. His mother, Lena Brown (nee Rube), was one of Freeland's
informants. He was born in Yosemite, and claimed the title of chief of the Yosemite band through inheritance
from his father, John Brown or Brandon. He and his brother Alvis claimed to be the only surviving speakers
of the Yosemite dialect. While working with me, he made some effort to give me forms as used around
Bootjack, a few miles south of Mariposa, where the work was being done, because more speakers of that
dialect remain. Sometimes, however, he said specifically that a particular form or pronunciation belonged to
the Yosemite dialect, and the features hereafter mentioned as possibly characteristic of Yosemite are based on
his comments. However, Chief Leeme was a ""professional Indian"" in a quite literal sense: he was employed
by the U. S. National Park Service to put on Indian dances for the edification of visitors to Yosemite National
Park. He clearly regarded such work as his true vocation, although he was no longer so employed when I
worked with him. He had a well-developed sense of showmanship, and did not feel constrained to restrict
himself to Yosemite or even Miwok features if he felt that the addition of something else would improve his
performance. Other informants claimed that in speaking Miwok he assumed a ""northern accent"" (""he spoke it
more like they do up Tuolumne way"") in order to make Yosemite speech sound different from that of
Mariposa, and that he ""belonged around El Portal"" rather than to the Yosemite band proper. These
considerations throw some doubt on the authenticity of his ""Yosemite dialect."" After his death, the material in
question could not be checked or expanded; even his brother Alvis, the last survivor of his family, then ceased
to be available for informant work. However, speakers of the Mariposa dialect recognized certain items as
being different in Yosemite speech, and it is clear that some differences did exist.
From 1957 on, my principal informants were Castro Johnson, Rose Watt, and Emma Lord. Mr. Johnson's
family always lived in Mariposa. His mother, who died in 1942, is said to have been a monolingual. He has
not spoken the language much since his mother died, and consequently feels a little rusty, so that he is hesitant
about starting to tell a long story in Miwok. Once started, however, he is fully capable of carrying on an
animated conversation or reciting a long text in the language. Mrs. Watt and Mrs. Lord are sisters, and live
together near Usona. Their father was Miwok, their mother Chuckchansi (Yokuts); they are both fluent
trilinguals. Between themselves they normally speak Miwok. They were born on the ranch where they now
live, and say that their father was from right there. The place where they live has an Indian name, /piliwni?/.
Less than a hundred yards from their ranch house there is a large archaeological site (4-Mrp-249). Brief
surface reconnaisances of this site yielded one historic artifact (a glazed potsherd, probably of Chinese origin),
and several projectile points of the most recent type known for the area. The owners report finding glass beads
there. The surface of the site is therefore presumably historic, and it seems reasonable to assume that it
represents the Miwok village of /piliwni?/, and that Mrs. Watt's and Mrs. Lord's father's family lived there. It
is less than 20 miles from Yokuts territory.
Lizzie and Banjo Graham also provided information during 1957 and 1958. Mr. Graham is Mrs. Watt's and
Mrs. Lord's mother's brother, and hence is Chuckchansi; Mrs. Graham is Miwok, being related to Mrs. Watt's
and Mrs. Lord's father. However, both Mr. and Mrs. Graham speak fluent Miwok as well as Chuckchansi and
English, and when visiting their nieces, which they did frequently in 1957, they speak Miwok most of the
time. Other informants listed above recorded short texts or provided other information on an informal basis.","[5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]"

Dr. Sylvia M. Broadbent prepared this grammar and dictionary based on her research and her Ph.D.
dissertation, A Grammar of Southern Sierra Miwok, at the Department of Linguistics, University of
California, Berkeley. She also wrote Central Sierra Miwok Dictionary in 1960. She received a B.A. and Ph.D.
in Anthropology from Berkeley in 1952 and 1960. Dr. Broadbent is Professor Emerita at University of
California Riverside. Her areas of interest are archaeology and ethnohistory of the Andean area, especially the
Chibcha of Columbia; and North American Indians, especially California and the Desert West. She has also
undertaken studies in descriptive and historical linguistics, especially American Indian languages and in
language and culture, including relationships between linguistic findings and other kinds of anthropological
research, and symbolism.
Dr. Broadbent lives in Carmel, California.
The Southern Sierra Miwok lived in Yosemite Valley, Mariposa, and the surrounding foothills. [Map.]Bibliographical Information

of the sky. (29) It got there and made bad luck for him, it tied him up by wishing, it tied him all up. (30) Being
tied up, (31) ""What did she do to me? What am I going to do now? (32) I'm in a sorry state,"" he said, after he
was tied up. Somewhere he wriggled all night long and all day. The other came looking for footprints in the
ground below, he went on the other side. She got there in the morning, when it got light. She got there and
found her husband rolling around there, he was tired. She reached him and took it off. (33) ""What are you
doing to me? You ran from me, you did that to me. What are you going to do? (34) Don't let him do that to
you. (35) You treated me very badly, you made me sleep with this tree. (36) I thought you were lying with
me, lying there close to me, and there was your singing, your voice fading away as you went far away, fading,
fading. I went to sleep, [snore, snore], that's what I said. (37) I got up, I woke up and felt it. I put my arms
around it, that tree, I hugged it hard. (38) 'What am I sleeping with?' I said. (39) I came at once when you
stopped talking, I followed you, I went everywhere. You told your people that (40) you didn't want me to hear
what I do, (41) what you do. When you got there, you thought you would go somewhere and vanish from me,
that you would leave me and run away from me. (42) I know where you are going, to the different sky. (43)
Do you think you will ever get there? They will kill you when you get there. (44) You won't do any good
staying in that country. (45) You won't stay long, you will die in a different world. (46) It would be better if
you take me with you, you ought to have me along. But now let me help you.
(47) [Song:] You are going with me, to your enemy, where he was killed. Now we are going somewhere else,
it's your fault, we are going to the other side of the world, we are going to see a different one.""
(48) They got to the place where the sky comes together. (49) He jumped across. (50) ""Come on, then:"" he
said to his wife. (51) ""What am I goingTEXTS510The Southern Sierra Miwok Language (1964), by Sylvia M. BroadbentTEXTS511The Southern Sierra Miwok Language (1964), by Sylvia M. BroadbentTEXTS512The Southern Sierra Miwok Language (1964), by Sylvia M. Broadbent

(53) ""Ow! It smashed my feet, it smashed m,, feet!"" she said crying there.
(54) [Song:] ""My feet are made flat now. Maybe I won't get there. I'm trying to keep up.""
(55) They got there, he carried her in his arms. (56) ""You see, you wanted to come with me. Do you think I
am going to a good place? I'm going to a different world, where I walk is not good. (57) I'm going to my
enemy, to where they killed my father. I'm going to challenge him to play football. (58) I want him to play
ball and kick his ball the other way, so that he can't kick it away. (59) In the same place I am going to kick
him around and kill him, he won't recover. (60) We are going to that different world where my people live,
my uncle. (61) You will sleep with my uncle, and I will sleep with my aunt."" (62) Then he could not see, he
has to listen to everything. At night they talked, they whispered. (63) His uncle told the Duck, ""This is what
was done to his father. He was kicked to the south, from the south they brought him back north. (64) They
went west, he came east. (65) The ball got there and came out this side of the track. (66) He kicked him all
around and killed him. (67) In the same place he roasted him, he cremated him, your father-in-law. They
cremated him in the same hole."" (68) Then also, Mole is sleeping with his aunt, they are whispering to each
other. ""That's what he did,"" she said. (69) ""He treated your father badly, your enemy. He ill-treated him. He
did that after he ill-treated him. (70) He is doing the same thing now to your husband. He will treat him
badly,"" he [?] said. (71) Then they went. In the morning he challenged him. (72) At night, the other, ""What's
going on? What are they talking about? Hey, who is he talking to?"" he said, (73) he was told that one from
both sides. The next day he went. ""I have come here. (74) I am going to challenge you with this ball that we
are kicking. (75) You won all my father's things, his food, everything he had hidden, their abalone shells, his
olive shells, his clothes, you won the beads. (76) Here are mine ready."" ""You are doing theTEXTS513The Southern Sierra Miwok Language (1964), by Sylvia M.

same thing, you are going just the same as the way your father went,"" he was told. (77) ""Ready. Let's try it
when the sun rises,"" he said. (78) They ran then. He kicked it south right away. Mole kicked it north and won,
(79) then he kicked those enemies all over. He cremated him in the same place in the hole. (80) The fire
burned, it burned and went right up. (81) It brought bad luck to Mole. (82) Mole ran under the ground when
he was suffering. The ground got hot, the water boiled, the tree burned, the rock got hot and melted. (83)
""Where am I to go? What am I to do?"" he said. (84) ""You see, I told you, they are going to kill us, that's what
I told you when we came.""
(85) [Song of Duck:] ""They are killing us, now, the early riser. Do your best. Let's run, in the water, but the
water's getting hot, it's boiling, when they go, when they go. He was right, that one, the sky who did that, he
made my feet flat, I can swim, I can swim along this creek.""
(86) They got there. (87) All the water was boiling. (88) They ran this way and that way, everything was
burning. (89) Then they got to a lake. Duck pulled out her arrow and pointed it there, and there, and there,
around this whatever, the lake, the water, with the arrow. ""Keep still there! Don't burn any more! Don't let the
water boil!"" she said. (90) She carried her husband on her back. (91) ""You see, I saved your life, you were
dead.
(92) [Song:] You were dead, if I had not come, obviously. Let the water and the land get cold.""","[509, 510, 511, 512, 513, 514, 515, 516, 517, 518]"

14. Coyote and Water Ouzel
(Told by Chris Brown)
(1) Long ago Coyote was in the tules. (2) He went to sleep there in the tules. (3) But a certain one called
Mosquito came up to him and talked about this sky above him. (4) ""Mmmmmm,"" he said singing, the
Mosquito. (5) But that one, Coyote, hit himself on the face when something landed on him, but he hit only
himself and bothered himself, (6) so he gave up. ""What can I do about this? Maybe if I go to this open country
there won't be any mosquitoes there."" (7) He came along the rocks and his feet just wore out. His old feet
were bleeding. (8) ""Ay!"" he said, ""Ay!"" With nothing to eat he grew hungry and thin. (9) ""Now, when I see
something to eat somewhere, I'm going to kill him and eat him,"" he said. (10) He went towards the east. For
days and days he did not find anything to eat anywhere, and he could not do anything for himself; (11) his
foot hurt, he could not chase anything. (12) He looked forward to eating a jack-rabbit, but he could not catch
up with it. (13) He cried over his feet and was sad. (14) Then he got to a little creek, as he kept on traveling,
and he saw a Crane standing up to his waist in the water, watching for trout to eat. (15) ""Hey, now I’ll eat,"" he
said, filled with anticipation when he saw this big one far off. (16) ""I’ll keep wandering on,"" he said. (17)
Then he came up to him. (18) ""Let me come up to him, let me talk to him, just wait,"" he said. (19) He got
there. (20) ""Hey, what are you doing so hard, you very big one here in the water, looking?"" he said. (21) ""I'm
looking at this one under you, so that the sky won't turn over on us. (22) If I don't do this, if I don't watch it, if
it falls it will kill all of us, (23) so I'm watching this water here. (24) When it gets worse, I'm going to run
around and go and tell the people. 'Move away! The sky is coming down on us,' is what I’ll say."" (25) Then,
""Maybe that'sTEXTS486The Southern Sierra Miwok Language (1964), by Sylvia M. BroadbentTEXTS487The Southern Sierra Miwok Language (1964), by Sylvia M. BroadbentTEXTS488The Southern Sierra Miwok Language (1964), by Sylvia M. Broadbent

true, you are a heavy man,"" he said, (26) ""And you are standing here. Maybe it's the truth that he said just
now. (27) Let me stand here, and you go and find me some food somewhere, I'm hungry."" (28) ""All right,"" he
said, but the Crane knew what he wanted to eat. (29) He saw some mushrooms, and his old belly was empty.
(30) So he kept standing there in the water holding the water down. (31) Then [Coyote] went on and further
down he arrived at a tree, and that certain one climbed it, another hunter of fish. He got there, (32) and just
watched him. (33) ""What are you doing? What is he looking down for?"" he said. (34) Then he asked, ""What
are you people doing in the creek? You are peering at the same thing under you in the water,"" he said. (35)
""This sky is going to fall, and we are here watching for something bad to arrive,"" he said. (36) ""We will tell
the people about it before he comes. (37) That's our job. (38) I'm the one who peers over from high up, I can
see a long way from here,"" he said. (39) ""But I am very hungry. Can I do something for you while you go and
get me something to eat? Maybe if you give me a little food, maybe I can survive, but I ought to help you,""
(40) and he climbed the tree, that one went, he ran perhaps to get some food. (41) He got up there and fell
down. He got to the ground at the bottom and climbed again. (42) ""I'm going to try again,"" he said. (43) He
got to the same place halfway up again, it broke and he fell. (44) That Coyote, being hungry, could not hold
himself, he could not do anything. (45) ""What am I going to do? Maybe I won't come out,"" he said. (46) [The
bird] looked at the water from halfway up the tree. (47) ""Maybe they are telling me the truth,"" he said. ""These
ripples in the water, maybe that's the truth. (48) I’ll just ask for food."" (49) That one went. After he went, after
he ran away, after looking and looking, Coyote said, ""Maybe he is telling me a lie in what he said to me."" (50)
He went on quietly. When he heard the leaves talking, (51) he ran back, he went to climb the tree and peep
out. ""He didn't do anything yet,"" he said. (52) He went on. The leaves talked. (53) When the leaves talked he
ran and returned to them. Little by little he went further and further till he got there, where one was standing
in the water. (54) ""I'm going to eat that one no matter what happens, I don't care what he does to me, I'm
going to eat him. I'm very hungry, I'm getting thin,"" he said. (55) He got there. ""What are you doing here?
You are jumping so much on these rocks and bouncing around. What are you going to do there under the
water? What are you peering around at from there? There, what is it that you are kicking so much underneath
all the time?"" (56) ""Oh, I haveTEXTS489The Southern Sierra Miwok Language (1964), by Sylvia M. BroadbentTEXTS490The Southern Sierra Miwok Language (1964), by Sylvia M. BroadbentTEXTS491The Southern Sierra Miwok Language (1964), by Sylvia M. Broadbent

a job watching the water, to tell the people when the sky falls, (57) so I'm kicking these rocks down because I
don't want it to come out on top. I'm holding it down. Once in a while I go below. I go to bounce all the way
to that rock, (58) then I go under the water, going to look to see if everything in the world is all right under the
water. (59) Then I come again, kicking these rocks, kicking them down because I don't want them to come
up."" (60) Then again he was thinking, ""Maybe it's true that it's going to fall. I've got to do something. I’ll say
that I'm going to look, I'm going to walk around under the water looking at everything. I can't do anything, I
am so hungry. I would help you, you are very small and very light to do that, to hold those rocks down. (61)
But I am heavy, I am a big person,"" he said. (62) So then, ""If you do that, if you help me, maybe I can go and
get some food for the starving ones. Where can I go to find it?"" (63) So then, ""Yes, please do that, I'm dying
of hunger, dying of hunger. I can't do anything."" (64) ""All right, I'm going. Maybe I’ll have to get food, it's all
gone here. I’ll go and get it and bring it, and later let me feed you with it, if you do that, if you take care of
these rocks for me. (65) You will jump to this one from here, all the way to the rock, and from that rock to
here again, you will dance around again. You will dance all the way over again, talking, saying ""Ee! Ee!,"" you
will talk and talk, if you jump on the rocks, if you dance. (66) Then if you stay longer, you will go there under
the water, going to look for this thing, if it does that to you, if the earth cracks on you, say."" (67) So he went,
he flew down below, to look for that food. (68) But this kept on going and told them there below, he told
some of them there, ""This thing, this big one, he's going to eat us. Maybe he's an ogre,"" he said as he went.
""Look out for yourselves, watch for him to come out, he will come out here. Try hard to be good to him, all of
you,"" he said. (69) Then all the little birds thought, ""Maybe that's true, he's getting rid of us, that one, he's
going to eat us and get rid of us people here,"" they said. (70) So he bounced around and looked forward to
[getting food]. He was so proud that he put on his flicker-feather headband, and with his costume he arrived
there and danced on top of the rocks. Being vain, he tried to keep up, that Coyote bounced around and
bounced around. (71) ""I'm going to peer at this country, at what's wrong here under the water. Maybe we
might fall down,"" he said. (72) ""I'm going anyhow, I'm going now here under the water, I'm going to arrive
somewhere, I’ll reach it,"" he just said. ""I'm going a long way. (73) But that one is thinking, that tiny one, the
little bird, he's not going far on top of the water, he's going to look,"" he said. (74) So high onTEXTS492The Southern Sierra Miwok Language (1964), by Sylvia M.

that rock he climbed and got set. He went high up, and came out on the rock, but the water was shallow and he
fell down there and broke his nose and blacked his eyes. (75) ""Maybe something did it to you when I landed
on it,"" he said when he came out. He clutched himself, but he danced just the same holding his hand; he
danced just the same, singing. He was proud of the costumes and things that he hid and put on, (76) saying,
""Maybe he can help me."" Then, ""I'm going to try again,"" he said, as his head got better and was not cut. (77)
""Maybe I'd better try again, maybe I can go to find it, maybe it can do something,"" he said. (78) He jumped
and went high up again, and came down. (79) Arriving at the bottom, he burrowed under the sand and rocks
and everything, starving [?]. ""What is he doing, maybe they treat me badly, poor old me,"" he said. (80) ""It
seems that I was treated badly, I was treated even worse. I'd better go, I'm only getting more hungry here
doing this, I am only keeping on playing with these rocks, and washing my hair in the water. Maybe I'd better
not stay very long, maybe I’ll get to something,"" he said seeing that one, (81) who had not gone far. (82) ""I'm
going."" (83) He went up the hillside. (84) From the hill he jumped in the water again. (85) He landed head
first and was more cut up. (86) He went over there again, and hearing something he ran. (87) ""Let them be
careless, let them die,"" he said, getting angry with those people. He went west. (88) ""I'm going there now just
the same, I don't care if I die on the road,"" he said. (89) ""I'm very tired from hunger. (90) Now they aren't
going to do that to me, they aren't going to treat me badly. (91) Now if I see any of those birds I eat him, I
swallow him, I don't care whether the world comes down or not,"" he said. (92) He went to the west, he did not
see anything, he went a long way. (93) ""What can I do? Where can I go?"" he said. (94) ""I’ll go over the land,
but this water looks bad to me,"" he said. (95) He went over the land. (96) He walked and walked through the
rocks. He came upon a certain Water Ouzel, (97) he came upon him there when he was shouting. ""It's
certainly a very little thing,"" he said, ""but what I'm going to do is eat him just the same. I don't care anyway,
let it fall down, all this rock below. (98) When I swallow him I am going to run, I'm going a long way off
again,"" he said. (99) ""Maybe they lied to me, it seems,"" he said. (100) The little one was running around
saying ""Ee! Ee!"" (101) He went in the holes in the rocks and came out the other side again. (102) ""What are
you doing, you bird who are so small?"" he said. (103) ""All right, I'm looking at these rocks, if these rocks do
that, if they shake down, thisTEXTS495The Southern Sierra Miwok Language (1964), by Sylvia M. BroadbentTEXTS496The Southern Sierra Miwok Language (1964), by Sylvia M. BroadbentTEXTS497The Southern Sierra Miwok Language (1964), by Sylvia M. Broadbent

anything, I'm too big, maybe I can't go through, I can't come out the way you come out."" (105) ""From here
you can only peer over, you can look around over there,"" he said. (106) ''But wait, closer, closer, come closer,
closer, closer, tell me, say it to me louder, make this talk easy for me,"" he said, (107) that Coyote to the little
one. ""All right,"" he said. ""From here just look at it, I'm going over there. You can see all the way to there if
these rocks are all right,"" he said. (108) Then this one went, he flew to the other side. (109) ""I'm going, or
he’ll eat me,"" this one said. ""He’ll eat me."" (110) ""I'm going to eat, I'm hungry."" His eyes changed when he
spoke, he only looked up, he couldn't do anything, he just had his mouth open. ""Huh, huh, huh, huh,"" he just
kept on saying. (111) He got there, he caught him, he swallowed that little Ouzel, he ate him. (112) ""Ah, but
now I have eaten! I have eaten now! Oh, my belly feels better,"" he said. (113) He rubbed his belly. ""Oh, but I
have eaten now, oh, now I’ll come out of it, I can go far, anywhere,"" he said. (114) But this old one a little
later came out again, outside of him. (115) He shouted in front of him. ""How did he do that to me? Where did
he come out of me? He came out."" (116) He looked at his teeth, his teeth were all right. (117) ""I thought I
swallowed him,"" he said. (118) ""But now I'm going to fix you."" He caught him and swallowed that little bird,
holding his rectum. He put his hand over his rectum, but the bird came out through his claws, through his feet.
(119) He flew away and landed far off. (120) ""You are going to eat me, you want to treat me badly,"" he said.
(121) ""But you can't get me,"" he said. (122) ""Hey, I closed it off with this hand of mine,"" he said, ""But he
came out of me."" (123) Then that old Coyote went away, he went any old way, he went somewhere north, still
hungry. (124) That's all of that.","[485, 486, 487, 488, 489, 490, 491, 492, 493, 494, 495, 496, 497, 498, 499, 500]"

11. Horse, Ox, and Alligator
(Told by Castro Johnson)
(1) And this is a different one that this one and I are telling, the girl sitting here and I. (2) Once the alligator
saw this jackrabbit sitting on the other side on the bare ground, there was no grass for him to eat, he was
hungry. (3) Then this one told him, ""Why don't you go to the other side here? You see they have plenty to
eat,"" he said. (4) ""But you know I can't swim,"" said the jackrabbit. (5) ""Oh, climb on my back, let me take
you,"" he said. (6) ""Oh, you mean you want to eat me, that's all that is,"" he said. (7) ""Oh, but I don't want to eat
you, you poor thin thing."" (8) ""It doesn't matter if I am thin, just the same in the middle you’ll want to eat me,""
he said. (9) ""Oh, I couldn't do that,"" he said. (10) ""Oh, all right."" (11) So he took him to the other side,
swimming with him. (12) He stopped close to a willow, a young willow, at maybe three feet or so, so that he
couldn't reach to jump across to the ground. (13) There he asked the horse who came. (14) Then he asked the
horse, ""I see you have plenty to eat here,"" he said to the horse. (15) ""Yes, there's plenty to eat. (16) Long ago
when I was young, I used to be fed, I used to have a bed prepared for me, I used to have a blanket put on me at
night, I used to be given water, I used to be brushed, I always stayed indoors. The next day I used to be fed
again. (17) Now that I've grown old, there's nothing. At night I don't sleep, I'm standing all night long, when
it's raining like this there's nowhere, how can you lie down, it's not dry. You have to stand around, just
because I'm so old. (18) When I was young they used to shoe me when I needed it, they used to look at the
shoes. (19) Now that I'm old I am left outside. (20) Good-bye,"" he said, (21) and went. (22) Then this bull
came. He did the same thing, he asked him again. ""You have plenty of food here,"" he said. (23) ""Yes,"" said
[the bull]. (24) He asked him the same thing again. (25) ""Yes, when I was young I used to be fed. Now that
I'm old they don't want to see me,"" he said. (26) ""I'm standing up all night long, there's nowhere that I can lie
down,"" he said again. (27) Then along came that fox; he was trying to get this jackrabbit to jump. (28) The
jackrabbit was afraid to jump, he could not jump onto the ground that way. (29) Then the bull said, ""That's all;
goodbye,"" (30) and left. (31) Then the jackrabbit looked and looked, and finally jumped. (32) That's all; he
jumped into that willow. (33) He just barely made it. He went; he crossed over. (34) The alligator really

aren't any leaves.
RW: (41) Then what is done next, it's peeled?
EL: (42) Yes, it's peeled with a small knife, it's skinned, this thing-umibob; ts skin, that's what I mean, it
comes off, just the white part is saved, the little ones, little tree shoots, that's made into the main part of the
cradle, the shade part, everything; you make the sunshade with that.
RW: (43) First the big ones are picked, to make this little bed, this cradle, isn't that right.
EL: (44) Yes, it's all one size. And then, and this, it can be made if desired, and it can be made of this
thingummy, whatever it is cooking—baskets are made of—of roots, and then, and this, and you skin the
what's it, something or other, little white oak sprouts.
RW: (45) That's another kind of tree, that the Indians used for making [baskets] long ago.
EL: (46) Yes.

EL: (48) It's twined with that.

RW: (55) Its shade is made.

EL: (58) One will decorate it with that, with little things, with little pretty things, with little colored things,
this something, with fine yarn.
RW: (59) They are different, it seems like, for a little boy, the design for the sunshade, isn't it.
EL: (60) Yes, there are several different kinds.
RW: (61) But a different kind for girls.
EL: (62) Yes, it's different too; that's how the makers do it.
RW: (63) Now not at all any more, they don't do that, it isn't done that way for babies now, it seems like they

10. Chasing Wild Horses and Mules
(Told by Castro Johnson)
(1) And this is a different one, we're telling about cowboys. (2) Every Sunday we used to go from here, from
Mariposa, maybe twenty-five [of us]. (3) And at Princeton we got maybe ten or twelve. (4) And then some
from Bear Valley used to come, maybe fifteen. (5) Maybe about eight or ten used to come from Hornitos. (6)
We all used to meet here. (7) Then all these cowboys here used to chase wild horses. (8) Every Sunday we
used to go there to go chasing. (9) Sometimes we didn't get any. (10) Then the last time we got some, maybe
fifteen. (11) This mule, then, we all put him there, we brought him to Princeton and put him in the corral. (12)
Then we said to one man, a young man, ""Ride him!"" (13) ""All right,"" he said, ""Put up five dollars and I’ll ride
him,"" he said. (14) So five dollars came in. (15) Then he got on that mule. (16) The mule didn't do anything,
he didn't jump, just as if he had already been ridden, (17) running back and forth as if he were following his
friends around. (18) Then, ""Get off that no-good old mule!"" they said. (19) He got off and took off his saddle.
(20) Then one man from Hornitos bought it for five dollars and took it down there to his ranch. He put him
inside, gave him barley to eat, and put water for him. (21) That mule just stood there, (22) I don't know how
long he stood there, he didn't eat anything. (23) Little by little he was starving to death. (24) He knelt down on
his front feet, he got tired. (25) He stayed that way a long time, who knows how long. (26) Next, gradually, he
went down with his hind feet too, and lay there on his stomach. (27) Then after doing that he lay down. (28)
He lay down then and stayed who knows how long, a long time. (29) Then, after lying down like that, next he
closed his eyes. (30) Then he died. (31) That's all.","[461, 462, 463, 464]"

12. Talking Ghosts
(Told by Castro Johnson)
(1) And here's another story. (2) Two little old people went where they had lots of children, they went to
baptize them. (3) Then those godparents baptized them [lit., ""gave them a bath""] on Sunday. (4) Then at
sunset they went back and got home. (5) Then later they often went, the man with his children, to get food.
They stayed for about one week. (6) Then his wife also went to get food too, and they stayed for some time
again, for three or four days. (7) Then again just the children went, (8) and then they stayed as long as they
could. (9) Then again his wife went to get food, from their godfather and godmother. (10) Then again they
stayed maybe one week or so. (11) Then the man went and was told about it by his wife. ""You'd better tell
them about it, whoever is coming now, that this is the last time. We didn't go and baptize them to give them
all their food, just to help them out. (12) Now it looks as if we're going to be giving them all their food all
their lives. (13) When somebody comes now, tell them that's all, so that they will know that they aren't to
come,"" he said. (14) Then his wife told them, ""My husband just said to me that this is the last time,"" she said.
(15) So the man said ""All right,"" and returned from there. He went and reached home, and got angry. (16)
Then he told his wife in the evening, ""Fix me a lunch, and a shirt, and socks,"" he said. (17) ""What's the
matter?"" his wife said. (18) ""Oh, nothing."" ""What do you mean by that?"" she said. (19) But later when he was
asked again he told her, (20) ""Oh, they don't want us to go to get food,"" he said. (21) ""Where are you going?""
(22) ""I don't know where I'm going, (23) but I'm going in the morning, while it's still dark. Maybe I’ll go north
somewhere,"" he said. (24) He went early in the morning. He went there. (25) In the evening he met one
cowboy going south. (26) ""Hold it: Where is the town, tell me? How far?"" (27) ""You’ll never get to the town,""
he said then. (28) ""It'sTEXTS471The Southern Sierra Miwok Language (1964), by Sylvia M. BroadbentTEXTS472The Southern Sierra Miwok Language (1964), by Sylvia M. BroadbentTEXTS473The Southern Sierra Miwok Language (1964), by Sylvia M. Broadbent

too far to walk from here to the town on foot. They’ll eat you,"" he said, ""the wild dogs. (29) You see that tree
far off. You'd better climb high up in it, and look around below at the ones that these wild dogs ate,"" he said
(30) and went. (31) He looked all around the tree when he got there in the evening, as it was getting dark. (32)
""Oh, that's what he meant, about these who got killed."" (33) He climbed that tree. (34) After he climbed up
and straddled the tree he listened. ""Who can have arrived on me here?"" he was saying of the talking
underneath him. (35) Then they talked. (36) ""Yes, we just fixed this up, we dammed it up just now,"" they
were saying to each other. (37) ""Yes, after we worked for a long time, it looks as if we dammed up where the
water comes out,"" some of them were saying. (38) ""They’ll never open it up,"" they were saying. (39) ""Only by
prying it up with a crowbar,"" they said. (40) Then in the morning he climbed down and looked all around. (41)
""Who is walking here around me?"" he said. (42) ""I don't see anybody's tracks, only these dead people. (43)
Maybe they are the ones who were talking,"" he said. (44) Then he went to the town. (45) He walked and
walked, it was nearly lunchtime when he got there. (46) He asked for water to drink, but the woman [said],
""What is it? Where is the water for me to give you? The water has dried up,"" she said. (47) ""Oh, maybe I can
fix it,"" said the man; that was what he had been listening to. (48) ""All right, then,"" she said, (44) and the
woman took him then to the headquarters. (50) Then the soldiers fetched him and took him, (51) and their
boss said, ""Do you want anything, any men?"" he said. (52) ""No, all I need is a crowbar."" (53) So they gave
him the crowbar (54) and he went. He looked up. (55). ""Oh, this is what they were talking about last night,"" he
said. (56) He pried it up little by little. (57) Then he opened it a little, enough that then the water could push it
out. (58) Then the water pushed it, and carried this rock down. (59) Then he was carried on their shoulders,
(60) and he was given another hat, a new one, and shoes and clothes, he was given everything, his hair was
cut. (61) The next day he was taken back, he was taken to his house with a mule packed with all sorts of food.
(62) His wife almost didn't know him, she did not recognize him. (63) Then the ones who brought him went
back when he got home. (64) Then the one, his godfather [lit., ""his father who gave him a bath""], ""Where did
you get so rich fast?"" he said. (65) ""Oh, I got angry that you told us 'you can't get any food,' so I went away, I
had to do something then, so that we wouldn't starve like that. (66) I went, and met a certain cowboy going
south. (67) Then I went north, and I reached and climbed that tree that the cowboy told me about.","[470, 471, 472, 473, 474, 475, 476]"

7. ?ywel•in
(Told by Castro Johnson)
(1) And now we are telling a different story; this girl is sitting listening. (2) Long ago, this ?ywel•in was
finishing off the people. He carried them off all the time, he used to kill them all and finish them off. (3) Then
he raised two little children, he brought them up. (4) Then those children used to play with the skulls of their
mother and their relatives, they used to roll them. (5) They would roll them to the bottom from on top over a
flat, sloping rock, then they would get them and take them back on top. (6) They used to do that every day, the
two little ones kept on playing. (7) Then one Coyote went to visit them and saw them. He stayed there who
knows how long. (8) He watched which way [?ywel•in] went, where he came out. (9) ""Goodbye,"" he said.
(10) ""Yes,"" he said; ""I’ll take care of the children here,"" he said. (11) He asked the children, ""Where does your
grandfather come out?"" (12) ""Right there he’ll always come out; he comes out there all the time,"" said the
children. (13) In the evening, then he came, (14) and they ate supper. But [Coyote] cooked this meat that he
had put in the bottom of the pack basket and ate it himself, he ate this jackrabbit hidden here in his pack
basket. (15) Then it was night, and they went to sleep. When [?ywel•in] was snoring hard, [Coyote] looked for
where his heart was. (16) Then he found it in the middle of his foot. (17) Then he stretched his feet out. When
he stretched out his legs, this is the way he went when [Coyote] touched him in the middle of his foot: ""Grunt,
grunt, grunt,"" he said. (18) Then, ""Oh, it's right there, your heart,"" [Coyote] said. (19) He went to sleep again.
(20) He did the same thing again, he stretched out, stretched himself out. Right in the middle of his foot, in the
middle of it, he did the same thing that way. ""Grunt, grunt, grunt,"" he said. (21) ""Oh, it's right there,"" said this
Coyote. (22) He went to sleep. They got up the next day, (23) and he went out the next day again. (24) Just the
same when he came back he came out in exactly the same place again. (25) [Coyote] was watching carefully
whether he would come out in the same or a different place. (26) He didn't come out any other place, only in
that very same place. (27) The next day he went again, (28) and the same way he watched where he went. (29)
Then he asked the children again, ""Will he come out the same place?"" he said. (30) ""Yes,"" they said. ""Does he
always come out in the same place?"" (31) ""Yes,"" they said. (32) In the evening for supper he cooked the meat.
(33) Then Coyote would hide it in the pack basket and eat his own meat, not what he was given, heTEXTS450The Southern Sierra Miwok Language (1964), by Sylvia M.

wouldn't eat that at all. (34) Then they went to sleep at night. (35) Then early in the morning, ""I'm going
hunting again,"" he said, and went. (36) He went the same way he always went. (37) Then Old Lady Coyote
went out next. (38) ""I'm going to get some wood,"" he said to his grand-children. (39) Then he went on the
other side of this high mountain, where he came out. He stuck his bone awls all around. (40) Then when he
came back he watched him. (41) ""Oh, you just came out, coming back again,"" he said. (42) He watched him.
(43) He stepped on one and sat down to pull it out; [another one] stuck him right there in the butocks. (44) He
rolled all around, (45) and got stuck all over then, (46) everywhere he went, where he rolled, (47) then he got
stuck all around in his ribs. (48) Then he died. (49) Then [Coyote] told all these nations, ""I killed this one, the
one who was finishing off us people,"" he said. (50) Then next they burned up this one that he killed. (51) ""All
of you watch well, you with good eyes. All watch this one. (52) If we don't find his eyes, he’ll finish us all off
again,"" he said. (53) ""Keep looking, watch for his eyes to pop out,"" he said. (54) So they burned him. (55)
Then a little later, when he got cooked, his eyes popped out. (56) Everybody looked up. (57) These two,
Spotted Towhee and Brown Towhee, ""You had better stay far off, you can't see, you've got too much matter in
your eyes,"" they said to these two. (58) They stayed far off and watched again. (59) Everybody failed to see it
pop. (60) So then, ""Did you see it?"" they asked these two with matter in their eyes. (61) ""How could we see
it?"" they said; (62) ""Our eyes are no good. (63) Look for it yourselves, you who have good eyes,"" they said.
(64) ""Please,"" they said. ""He’ll finish us all up if you don't tell us; maybe you saw where his eyes landed. (65)
But if we don't find them, he’ll eat all of us,"" they said. (66) ""Yes, under that thing, it looks like his eyes,
[under] those leaves."" (67) Then they got them. (68) ""Yes, that's it,"" they said. (69) They got them, and
mashed them all up. Then everything was all right. (70) That's all.","[449, 450, 451, 452, 453, 454, 455]"

4. Measuring Worm
(Told by John Lawrence)
(1) This is really a story of the country; this one is the story of the land. (2) Long ago, maybe when there were
no people, he swam, the Green one, as they say, maybe; his something, his older brother, (3) Green One's
older brother, that's it. (4) El Capitan grew up and carried him up, that Green One's older brother.
(5) ""Green One, tell me, where are you?"" he said, crying out. (6) ""Where are you, Green One?"" he said, crying
out again. (7) Then Coyote came along. (8) Then he told Coyote all about it. ""My older brother got carried up
here by that high rock,"" he said. (9) He went. ""I'm going to hire [people to help]."" He hired everybody.
(10) They jumped, they kept on jumping up, they couldn't reach him, (11) they fell down. (12) Then he
fetched Mountain Lion. (13) He surpassedTEXTS426The Southern Sierra Miwok Language (1964), by Sylvia M. BroadbentTEXTS427The Southern Sierra Miwok Language (1964), by Sylvia M. BroadbentTEXTS428The Southern Sierra Miwok Language (1964), by Sylvia M. Broadbent

all of them when he jumped up, (14) he hit it with his body, and he was too low too.
(15) And then there's the other one, the old bear, the big old hole, that's the old bear's hole, where he landed he
left a hole, close to the tree. (16) That's the place where the bear landed. (17) Then he called him [to] El
Capitan, what the Indians call a fly, yes, that's it, next, the Measuring Worm. (18) ""Now I'm going, I say,
climbing,"" Measuring Worm said. (19) ""I'm going to climb that cliff,"" Measuring Worm said.
(20) He went higher. (21) There, near Pohono, away from the rock. (22) From there, he bent over to the other
side there on top of El Capitan. (23) He found nothing left but bones, of Green One's older brother. (24) So he
tied them up and threw them down from there.
(25) Then he became a person when he got to the ground. (26) They praised him. He outdid everybody,
Mouse, Wood Rat, everything, Squirrel [and] all of them tried and failed to get him, (27) they couldn't make
it. But that Measuring Worm beat them all. (28) He made a bridge across to there. (29) So! That's all.

16. Chief Tenaya
(Told by Chris Brown)
(1) Long ago they say Tenaya talked about this, when the white people pushed him. (2) He arrived
somewhere, he went to Tenaya Lake (3) and coming back he arrived. The white soldier found him, clubbed
him and nearly killed him. (4) They brought him this way, they took him to the west, to what the white men
call Oakhurst (who knows the Indians' name). (5) There they had nothing to eat for several days. They just lay
there. They cracked acorns. (6) After they got the acorns, they ate them. The meat and things that the white
people gave them they threw away. (7) ""They are killing us,"" they said. (8) They took Tenaya himself to the
San Joaquin Valley. (9) Then at night he felt sorry for himself. (10) The soldier killed his child. ""I'm thinking
about my child, about going back to him, to see him and take care of him,"" he said. (11) Then at night he told
the Indians, ""It is said that if we don't go with these white people they will kill us and get rid of all of us. (12)
All of you go with these white people, but I am going to take care of my child, to see how he is there, I am
going to bury him and burn him,"" he said. (13) He ran from there this way. (14) Lebrado, or somebody, maybe
he, he was a little boy, he talked to me and told me that in answer, he told me at night. He came along the
creek, they waded the creek this way. (15) Everybody came. (16) The soldiers got there the next day, the
Indians had gone and run away. (17) But the soldier thinks, ""They are tired, let them rest. They have nothing
to eat,"" he said. (18) ""They won't go anywhere,"" said he, this one, what was his name, his captain. (19) Then
they came this way. They went along the creek, they climbed up to what they now call Bridal Veil. (20) Then
below he reached where the bear ate his child, dragging him around. (21) ""He didn't keep very well,"" he
thought. He took his child (22) and brought him to Bear Creek, as they call it, and buried it there, his bones.
(23) He himself died too, he was killed on the other side of the mountains by the Monos. They clubbed him.
(24) After they clubbed him and killed him they laid him out. (25) John Hutchins, whom we call Tom
Hutchins, he brought him, nothing but his hair, he brought it to the Indians. The Indians wept, they cried all
one night. (26) The next day they buried him there in Yosemite, at what is called the Museum. He was buried
there, his dust, as they say. (27) Then the Indians, ""They are different, they are another kind of people, it is
said,"" they thought. ""That's right,"" they said.","[518, 519, 520, 521]"

(25) Then he yelled and cried, (26) ""Father, father, I won't do that again,"" he said. (27) After they put him in
the wilds they went, they went back home. (28) Then, from the north, this Coyote came and heard him. (29)
""What is this yelling down here?"" he said. (30) He came listening. (31) Little by little, he got closer and
closer. (32) He was yelling this way: ""Father, father, please, please let me go, get me out! I’ll never do that
again."" (33) ""What's that talking so much?"" said Coyote. (34) Gradually he got to the top of the mountain, the
talking became clearer.
(35) Little by little, he got closer. (36) ""It seems that something is talking,"" he said. (37) He went on. (38)
""Oh, he is in the coffin,"" he said when he got closer. (39) When he got there, he knocked on it.
(40) ""What's the matter with you?"" (41) ""Oh, I said something that my father didn't like,"" he said. (42) ""All
right, where is your house?"" [Coyote] said. (43) ""South of here,"" he said, (44) ""the first house south of here,
maybe about five miles,"" he said.
(45) ""Do you know where the axe is?"" [Coyote] said. (46) ""There in the woodshed,"" he said. (47) ""All right,
I'm going to get it, I’ll come back soon."" (48) Then he got that axe and went back, that's the way he went. (49)
When he got there, he chopped up the outside boxes until he got to the one underneath, where he was, (50)
and set him free.
(51) ""From here on, don't ever go back to your house. (52) Go north, east, or anywhere, but don't ever go to
your house there. (53) I'm going south. (54) I give you this cane; (55) you will ask this cane for everything
you want,"" [Coyote] said.
(56) ""All right."" (57) Coyote went south, (58) and he went north, until he saw a house. (59) ""Oh, maybe I
should try out my cane,"" he said. (60) So he tried it.
(61) ""I want to be an old man,"" he said to his cane. (62) He became old. (63) He went on to the house and
knocked, (64) and a woman came out. (65) ""Can you give me something to eat?"" he said.
(66) ""Yes, sit down there."" (67) Then he sat down there on the porch. (68) Then the woman finished bringing
him food (69) and he ate. (70) When he finished eating he went on (71) to the road.
(72) He went on northwards. (73) When he got out of sight he turned young again. (74) He went on this way
until it got dark. (75) When it got dark, he saw a house again, so he became an old man and went toTEXTS435The Southern Sierra Miwok Language (1964), by Sylvia M.

right, wait there,"" she said then. (78) So he waited again. (79) When he had eaten, he went on again. ""Where
is there a house around here?"" [he asked someone].
(80) ""Oh, maybe in the evening, about then you’ll get to one house,"" he said. (81) Then he went on and on till
it was evening, (82) when he got to one house. (83) He got a job there. (84) ""Yes, you can take care of these
ducks,"" he said.
(85) So he went to sleep. (86) When he got up in the morning, (87) he was given a shotgun, (88) and he went
over on the other side of a little hill like this to a valley, and watched over those ducks. (89) In the evening he
took them back and put them in the corral. (90) He used to go to sleep, have supper, then go to sleep. (91)
Then he went back and did the same thing, (92) every day he watched over them in the valley. (93) Then one
time their daughter watched him from upstairs, from the upper part of the house, (94) the pretty horse, with
spurs, bridle, saddle, everything become elegant, the man become young and riding his horse around, she saw
from upstairs there.
(95) When he came home at night, he became old; (96) that's what he did all the time. (97) Then one day the
girl asked her mother, ""Can I marry this man?"" she said. (98) ""What do you want to marry such an old man
for?"" said her mother. (99) Then, ""Come, then, tomorrow, come to the upper part of the house where I live,
you should see if he's an old man,"" she said.
(100) Then next day he went again and took the ducks to the same place in the valley. (101) Then her mother
came upstairs and watched him. (102) ""Can that be the same man?"" she said. (103) ""It's the same, the only
one; he does that every day,"" [the daughter said]. (104) ""Well, you'd better ask your father,"" she said.
(105) So she asked her father. (106) ""Father, can I marry this man?"" she said. (107) ""What do you want to
marry such an old man for?"" said her father. (108) ""You should see him, you should come tomorrow and see
and watch that man. He's nothing like an old man,"" she said. (109) Then next day he watched him take out the
horse, a pretty one, he took him out and rode him around.
(110) ""It can't be the same man,"" he said. (111) ""It doesn't look like it, but there's only the one man living
there, staying there,"" said their daughter. (112) ""If you want to, you can marry him,"" he said. (113) So they got
married the coming week. (114) He became young and never got old again.","[434, 435, 436, 437, 438, 439, 440]"

6. How Coyote Stole The Sun
(Told by Castro Johnson)
(1) Here's another different one that we are telling. (2) Long ago, the people used to live in the dark, without
the sun. (3) They couldn't see anything; (4) everything used to be dark. (5) This Coyote went far off to the east
from here; he stayed who knows how long, and then came back.
(6) ""Uncle! Uncle! You ought to see [how it is] far off in the east. They have sunshine over there in the east,
east of here,"" he said to his uncle.
(7) His uncle did not believe him. (8) Then, he stayed there at the house. The wife of this uncle of his, Wood
Rat, she gathered all kinds of things, here and there, redmaids, she used to pile up things to eat. (9) Then
Coyote went again to the east, somewhere far from here is where he went. (10) He stayed who knows how
long, maybe a month, maybe a year. (11) Then he came back and said the same thing.
(12) ""Uncle! You ought to see it,"" he said. His uncle didn't believe him.
(13) Another time he goes again, east of here, he does the same thing. (14) ""This time I’ll take a flower,"" he
said. (15) He took this flower, shooting-stars, which was coming out there in the east. (16) Then he came
back; he took it from there and came back here. (17) He showed it to his uncle.
(18) ""Look here, uncle! They have flowers far off in the east,"" he said. (19) Then [his uncle] said, ""Yes."" (20).
Then he stayed there again; oh, a long time again. (21) ""I'm going,"" he said to his uncle. (22) ""This time I'm
going to steal their sun,"" he said. (23) ""Then we will have the sun here in our country,"" he said. (24) ""It's not
good thatTEXTS444The Southern Sierra Miwok Language (1964), by Sylvia M. BroadbentTEXTS445The Southern Sierra Miwok Language (1964), by Sylvia M. BroadbentTEXTS446The Southern Sierra Miwok Language (1964), by Sylvia M. Broadbent

we stay here in the dark all the time and can't see anything,"" he said.
(25) Then he said, ""Goodbye""
(26) He went far off east of here. He watched these people going about, a bunch of young fellows, there in the
mountains.
(27) ""Maybe I'd better turn into a log,"" he said.
(28) He went under a tree where they were walking and turned into a log. (29) Then, when these hunters came
back, ""Let's carry this one,"" two of them said to each other. (30) ""Yes, let's take it and put it on the fire,"" he
said.
(31) Then they carried him on their backs and took him to this dance-house where they all lived, Mountain
Lion, that Bear, all of them fast runners except Turtle. (32) Then they put him on the fire. But what he did was
wriggle around and around, when they put him in the fire.
(33) Then, ""Oh, we’ll put it on the fire later, when we go to sleep,"" they said. (34) ""Yes,"" they said to each
other.
(35) Then they went to sleep. Later they took him and put him closer, and he lay there. (36) When they went
to sleep, he wriggled around and then listened. (37) They were all snoring, so he got up and picked up a big
basket. (38) Then he goes and gets this sun, (39) and runs with it to the west.
(40) ""Let's run! Let's run!"" said the Turtle. (41) ""I scratched him, I scratched him,"" he said. (42) He ran with it
and outdistanced them all. (43) Then he came and released that sun there.
(44) ""Uncle!"" he says, arriving at the house. (45) ""I stole it,"" he said. (46) ""In a while we’ll have sunshine, you
should see it,"" he said. (47) He kept on coming out and coming out to look at that sun. (48) Finally, it seemed
to be getting light. ""Come on, uncle! Come and see it! It's getting light,"" he said.
(49) His uncle came out. ""Oh, you're really telling the truth,"" he said. (50) ""You're telling the truth, that's the
way they do it back in the east.""
(51) ""Yes, but they haven't got the sun now over in the east. (52) I took it all,"" he said.
(53) Then the sun rose up and came out, and they saw everything. (54) Then that Eagle's wife was astonished
at what she had gathered up, everything piled up here, there, and everywhere. She was always working, this
wife of Eagle, Wood Rat. (55) Then the sun shone on us, and to this very day does. It never went back. (56)
That's all.","[443, 444, 445, 446, 447, 448, 449]"

1. Collecting Basketry Materials
(Conversation between Rose Watt and Lizzie Graham)
RW: (1) Long ago, how did the Indians gather roots? Do you know what they did?
LG: (2) Yes, I know. (3) They would dig in the hard ground with a digging stick. (4) It was difficult, but they
did it, they kept at it and got the roots out.
RW: (5) With a digging stick.
LG: (6) With a digging stick.
RW: (7) They dug the ground.
LG: (8) They dug the ground.
RW: (9) What kind of roots would that be? They chose good long ones, long ago.
LG: (10) Long ago they chose good roots, they chose long ones. (11) They would be very white inside.
RW: (12) Then next, gathering roots—how did they do it? (13) They would break them off.
LG: (14) They would break them off; they would dig them out, following them with the digging stick, then
they would stop there and break them off.
RW: (15) Then next they would gather them together when they were finished.
LG: (16) They would gather them together, and go to dig out another one. (17) They would gather up the roots
and tie them up.
RW: (18) Then there would be a lot.
LG: (19) There would be a lot.
RW: (20) Maybe it would take a little while.
LG: (21) It would take quite a while for there to be many; in this way, they prepared long ones.
RW: (22) Then next, when they were finished, they would eat lunch.
LG: (23) They'd eat their lunch, when they got hungry.
RW: (24) And they would do the same thing after lunch, next.
LG: (25) After lunch, they'd do it fast, right away, because they would walk a long way going home.","[14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 110, 111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 120, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125, 126, 127, 128, 129, 130, 131, 132, 133, 134, 135, 136, 137, 138, 139, 140, 141, 142, 143, 144, 145, 146, 147, 148, 149, 150, 151, 152, 153, 154, 155, 156, 157, 158, 159, 160, 161, 162, 163, 164, 165, 166, 167, 168, 169, 170, 171, 172, 173, 174, 175, 176, 177, 178, 179, 180, 181, 182, 183, 184, 185, 186, 187, 188, 189, 190, 191, 192, 193, 194, 195, 196, 197, 198, 199, 200, 201, 202, 203, 204, 205, 206, 207, 208, 209, 210, 211, 212, 213, 214, 215, 216, 217, 218, 219, 220, 221, 222, 223, 224, 225, 226, 227, 228, 229, 230, 231, 232, 233, 234, 235, 236, 237, 238, 239, 240, 241, 242, 243, 244, 245, 246, 247, 248, 249, 250, 251, 252, 253, 254, 255, 256, 257, 258, 259, 260, 261, 262, 263, 264, 265, 266, 267, 268, 269, 270, 271, 272, 273, 274, 275, 276, 277, 278, 279, 280, 281, 282, 283, 284, 285, 286, 287, 288, 289, 290, 291, 292, 293, 294, 295, 296, 297, 298, 299, 300, 301, 302, 303, 304, 305, 306, 307, 308, 309, 310, 311, 312, 313, 314, 315, 316, 317, 318, 319, 320, 321, 322, 323, 324, 325, 326, 327, 328, 329, 330, 331, 332, 333, 334, 335, 336, 337, 338, 339, 340, 341, 342, 343, 344, 345, 346, 347, 348, 349, 350, 351, 352, 353, 354, 355, 356, 357, 358, 359, 360, 361, 362, 363, 364, 365, 366, 367, 368, 369, 370, 371, 372, 373, 374, 375, 376, 377, 378, 379, 380, 381, 382, 383, 384, 385, 386, 387, 388, 389, 390, 391, 392]"

8. Stealing Horses
(Told by Castro Johnson)
(1) And here's a different one. (2) Long ago the Indians used to go to the west to get horses, to steal them.
When they came back, they stole them and used to bring the horses of these Mexicans. (3) Then they were
chased and tracked up these mountains. (4) Then two old men were reached by these Mexicans, who made
war on them and kept on shooting at them. They shot one old man's bowstring. (5) But then he dodged
around, it didn't matter that his bowstring was shot off. They kept on shouting for their comrades, yelling. (6)
Then their comrades saw them from on top of the mountain. They ran down and chased them. They fought
each other back and forth. (7) Then these Mexicans got scared and went west, they went home. (8) Then one
man chased them, up the hill and up the hill they went. Way up on top he got to them. (9) But nobody at all
got killed. (10) Then they went back, these Mexicans, to their houses there in the west. (11) But they didn't get
any of the horses, they didn't take them back. (12) All of their horses were killed and made into meat. (13) So!
That's all.
9. Two Little Bears and Two Little Deer
(Told by Castro Johnson)
(1) Two little bears were playing with two little deer. (2) Then, playing that way, the bears said ""You go in!""
(3) The little deer went in. ""We'd better say 'maa-maa-maa,' and you let us out,"" they said. (4) ""All right,"" said
the bears. (5) Then the bear cubs went in. (6) ""You'd better say 'maa-maa-maa,'"" they said. (7) Then they went
in, but they didn't say ""maa."" They died inside there of this smoke. (8) When they didn't say ""maa"" for a long
time, [the deer] looked in [and found] both of them had died. (9) Then they took them inside and put them on
their bed as if they were asleep. (10) Then their mother smelled their burning hair and came running. She
couldn't find her children; she looked everywhere. (11) Then she looked in the bed. (12) When she saw them
dead in the bed, she looked for the little deer. She tracked the deer, she tracked them until she found them
there in the crack. (13) Then this one, theirTEXTS456The Southern Sierra Miwok Language (1964), by Sylvia M. BroadbentTEXTS457The Southern Sierra Miwok Language (1964), by Sylvia M. BroadbentTEXTS458The Southern Sierra Miwok Language (1964), by Sylvia M. Broadbent

grandfather, ""Step down, far down,"" he said. (14) Then she stepped down a long way, stepping as far as she
could reach. When she stepped down to the bottom, he hit her with a hot rock, (15) and killed her. (16) That's
all.","[455, 456, 457, 458, 459, 460, 461]"

15. Coyote, Duck, and Mole
(Told by Chris Brown)
(1) Long ago Coyote came walking down the creek in the sand. He got to a place where a certain Duck was
pounding. (2) ""What are you doing so hard?"" he said. (3) She answered, ""This is what I'm doing.","[500, 501, 502, 503]"

Besides my informants, to whom I am indebted for generous hospitality and the warmest and most rewarding
friendship as well as for information, I wish to thank Donald and Eleanor Loomis, of Mariposa, who made my
stays in the field easy and enjoyable by their many kindnesses. I also owe a profound debt to Mary R. Haas,
Murray B. Emeneau, George M. Foster, and David L. Olmsted, who have read various drafts of the
manuscript. I have profited greatly from their helpful and constructive criticism. While final responsibility for
any errors or omissions in the present work is mine alone, it is my sincere hope that it will reflect the wisdom
of their guidance, not only in connection with this project, but throughout my years of graduate study.","[12, 13]"
