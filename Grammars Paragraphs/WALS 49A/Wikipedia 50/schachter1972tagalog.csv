"§2.4. Nominal predicates.
Tagalog nominals, whether serving as predicates or occurring in other sentence positions, may bedivided into two large classes: MARKED and UNMARKED, A masked nominal is a nominal whose
function in a sentence is always explicitly indicated in one of the two following ways: (1) by the form of
the nominal itself, or (2) by the form of a preceding MARKER. (A marker is a word that indicates the
grammatical function of another word or group of words.) Tagalog has three types of marked
nominals:PERSONALPRONOUNS,DEICTICPRONOUNS(sometimescalledDEMONSTRATIVEPRONOUNS), and PERSONAL NOUNS (in general, nouns that name specific persons). In the case of
personal and deictic pronouns, the function of the pronoun in the sentence is always marked by its own
form. In the case of personal nouns, the function of the noun in the sentence is always indicated by the
form of a preceding marker.
Tagalog has eight personal pronouns and four deictic pronouns. Each of these pronouns occurs in one
of three different forms according to its function in the sentence. (The preceding statement is a slightoversimplification in the case of the second-person-singular pronoun and that of the composite pronoun
kita: cf. §3.3.) These are, of course, a great many personal nouns, but all are marked by a single set of
three markers, one for each of three different kinds of sentence functions. (For the pluralization of these
markers, cf. §3.9).
Complete lists of the forms of the deictic and personal pronouns are given in § §3.3 and 3.4
respectively. The personal-noun markers are summarized in §3.5. For present purposes, it is necessary to
present only the forms that occur in predicate-nominal position. These are:a). the following personal pronouns:
ako
T
kata
‘you and I/we""
ikaw

‘he/she’kami
tayo

sila= ‘T_and others/we*
‘you and I (and others)/we’
‘you (and others)""
‘he and others/she and others/they’b). the following deictic pronouns:

non-plural and a plural of the first person, the dual, the second person, and the third person. One of these
categories, the second-person non-plural, is represented by four distinct forms:two ang forms (ikaw andka, predicate and topic forms respectively — cf. §2.13), a ng form, and a sa form. The other seven
categories are represented by three forms each.
The first-person singular — ako/ko/akin — is the only category of Tagalog personal pronouns that
correspondswithperfectconsistencytoacategoryofEnglishpronounssingular: ‘I/me/my/mine’). In other cases, a single Tagalog category corresponds
categories and/or several Tagalog categories to a single English category.
TheTagalogdualnon-plural — Kata/nita/kanita -- correspondsto theEnglish(thefirst-personto several English
first-personplural(‘we/us/our/ours’) when the latter is used to refer to the speaker and a single individual addressed. The dual
non-plural is thus, literally, ‘you (singular) and I’. Dual non-plural pronouns are obsolescent in educated
Manila Tagalog, and many speakers do not use them at all, using the dual plural — sayo/natin/atin — for
‘you (singular) and I’ as well as ‘you (plural) and I’; sce below.
The Tagalog second-person singular — ikaw/ka/mo/iyo -- corresponds to the English sccond-person
(‘you/your/yours’) when the latter is used to address a single individual who is a relative belonging to ayounger generation, a friend, a social inferior, or — in the case of children and adolescents — an age-mate;
the secund-person non-plural is also used in addressing God. In addressing single individuals who do not fit
into one of these categories, the second-person singular is replaced by the sccond-person or third-person
plural; see below. (As was noted in §2.13, there is a special composite pronoun kita /kitah/ that combines
the meanings of a first-person-singular mg form and a second-person-singular ang form. Kita thus occurs in
place of the non-occurring sequences *ku ka and *ka ko).","[98, 99]"
"Personal pronouns.
The forms of the personal pronouns are given in Chart 7. On the chart, the pronouns are arranged intwo groups: NON-PLURAL and PLURAL. (The first group is called non-plural rather than singular because
it included dual pronouns, meaning literally ‘you (singular) and I’. The plural pronouns have, as a group, the
meanings of the corresponding non-plural pronouns with the additional meaning ‘and others’ (or ‘and
another’): thus the first-person plural is literally ‘I and others’, the dual plural ‘you (singular) and I and
others’, etc. For each pronoun, both the conventional spellings and a phonemic transcription are given. For
the sake of simplicity, only subject pronouns (c.g., ‘I') are shown in the English translations, although in
many cases an ang form may actually correspond to an English object pronoun (e.g., ‘me*), ang form toa
possessive pronoun (e.g., ‘my’, ‘mine’), and asa form (o either an object pronoun or a possessive pronoun.",[98]
"’lasang-isda (lasa ‘taste’, isda ‘fish’) ‘tasting of fish’, an object relation in the bases of such verbs as
magbigay-galang (bigay ‘giving’, galang ‘respect’) ‘show respect’ or magbangong-puri (bangon ‘raise’, puri
‘honos’) ‘redeem one’s honor’, etc. Because of the similarity of compound adjectives and compound verbbases to nominal compounds, no further treatment of the adjectives and verbs is included in this text.)§3.9. Pluralization of nominals.
Tagalog has devices for pluralizing nouns, deictic, personal, and interrogative pronouns, verbs,
adjectives, and adjective phrases. Thus Tagalog has a wider range of plural formations than does English, in
which only nouns, personal and deictic pronouns, and verbs have distinctive plurals. The number
distinctions of English, however, have a more central role in the language than the number distinctions ofTagalog. In the first place, obligatory choices between singular and plural formations are common in
English, but rare in Tagalog. In English, for example, a speaker must make a choice between expressing the
plural in the case of most common nouns. If he says te book, he is clearly referring to one object; if he
says the books, to more than one. In Tagalog, on the other hand, although there is a way of explicitly
pluralizingmostunmarkednouns,thepluralizationof a nounneednot — and,in somecases in fact,cannot — be formally signaled if the context makes the plural meaning clear. Without context the sentence
Nasa mesa ang libro means ‘The book is on the table’. But the same sentence can be used to mean ‘The
books are on the table’ in a situation where both the speaker and the hearer know that more than one bookis being referred to. (The insertion of the word mga (/manah/) before /ibro would make the plural meaning
explicit — sce below).
In English there are also certain obligatory number agreements between the subject and the predicate
of a sentence: The man is a lawyer{The men are lawyers. \n Tagalog there is, in general, no obligatorynumber agreement between the predicate and the topic. Either the predicate alone, the topic alone, or both
may in most cases be pluralized:
Mga abogado ang lalaki.
Abogado ang mga lalaki.
Mga abogado ang mga lalaki.",[121]
"‘The men are lawyers.’There are, however, a few cases of obligatory number agrcement — as well as of obligatory absence of
number agreement — which are discussed below.
Plurality in Tagalog is expressed through a variety of grammatical devices. In the case of personalPronouns and certain personal-noun phrases, it is expressed by distinctive plural forms: in that of
interrogative words and certain adjectives, by duplication. In other cases specific pluralizing affixes are
used. Elsewhere its most common expression involves the word mga, which adds the meaning of plurality to
the sentence element that follows it.
The plural forms of personal pronouns are presented in §3.3; those of interrogative words, in §7.7.
Plural noun and verb affixes are presented in § §3.9 and 5.14 respectively; the pluralization of adjectives, in§4.11. The present section deals first with the use of ga as a pluralizer of unmarked nouns, deictic
pronouns, and personal nouns, then with the pluralization of personal-noun markers.
Mga is a conventional spelling for phonemic /manah/. This word, which is a PROCLITIC (i.c., does
not occur phrase finally), has two different meanings — approximative and plural — according to the type
of construction in which it occurs. Sfga is approximative when it occurs with a cardinal number or withatimeexpression.‘around’:[n its approximativemiga sainpu‘approximatelymeaningten’; mgasigatranslatesala ura‘aboutEnglish ‘approximately’,
one‘about’, oro'clock’; sa mga buwan ng Encro‘around the month of January’. (The approximative use of sga is discussed in § §4.4 and 6.8.) In all other
cases niga adds a plural meaning to the sentence clement that follows it.
Mga occurs in its plural meaning with unmarked nouns, deictic pronouns, and personal nouns. (Pluralniga also occurs with adjectives — cf. §4.11 — and with nominalized verbals and adjective phrases — cf.
§3.24.) Normally, it immediately precedes what it pluralizes:
mga librong para sa bata‘books for the child/children’librong para sa mga bata‘a book/books for the children’112CHAPTER 3(When mga is used to pluralize a modification construction in which the modifier precedes the
head — cf. §3.11 — mga may precede either the entire construction or the head. Thus:
mga para sa batang libro“books for the child.’)
para sa batang mga libro
In the case of unmarked nouns, Tagalog makes a distinction between pluralizable and unpluralizable
nouns that is like a distinction made in English. Some English nouns, e.g., table and party, have distinct
plural forms, while others — ¢.g., furniture and fun — normally do not. Similarly in Tagalog there are some
nouns that occur freely with »nga and others that normally do not. The two classes of nouns may be calledCOUNT and MASS nouns respectively, following the usage of English grammarians.
In gencral, Tagalog count nouns correspondto English count nouns, and refer to items that areperceived as discrete units: e.g.. bahay ‘house’. baro ‘dress’, bata ‘child’. Similarly, Tagalog mass nouns
generally correspond to English mass nouns, and refer to items that are not normally perceived as discrete
units: e.g., alikabok ‘dust’, asin ‘salt’, aso ‘smoke’. In some cases, however, the Tagalog
translation-equivalent of an English mass noun is a pluralized count noun: mga balita ‘news’, mga
kasangkapan ‘furniture’, mga maleta ‘baggage (bags)’. (Some speakers occasionally use mga with a mass
noun(1) to express the idea of several masses:e.g., wga alikabok ‘heaps of dust’ or (2) with the implieddeletion of a count noun: ¢.g., sga tubig, short for mga baso ng tubis ‘glasses of water’.
When a deictic pronoun is pluralized by mga, the ang form of the deictic is used in all cases, and the
function of the deictic in the sentence is indicated by a marker (ang, ng, or sa) before the mga, rather thanby a change in the form of the deictic itself. Thus:
Silya itobut‘This is a chair.”","[121, 122]"
"‘That's the house.”
‘Juan’s the youngest child.’(Note that in the examples the marked-nominal predicate is translated by a subject in English. More precisebut more awkward English equivalents might be ‘The American is he’, etc. In any case, the Tagalog
sentences suggest contexts in which the predicates represent relatively new information — cf. §2.2).
All nominals other than personal and deictic pronouns and personal nouns are UNMARKED NOUNS.
The function in a sentence of an unmarked noun is never explicitly indicated by the form of the noun
itself, and is not always explicitly indicated by a preceding marker. Unmarked nouns do occur in many
constructions after function-indicating markers (e.g., after the marker ang in topic position — cf. §2.16),
but unlike personal nouns, unmarked nouns also occur in constructions without markers. One of theseconstructions is the nominal predicate.
An unmarked noun in predicate position usually expresses one of two kinds of gencral meanings: ‘a
member of the class
” or ‘the class
*, These two kinds of meanings may be called INDEFINITE
and GENERIC respectively. In English, these meanings are normally expressed by the choice of the articlethat precedes a noun or by the absence of an article before the noun: the articles a/an, and some are the
usual signs of the indefinite; the absence of an article is a frequent sign of the generic. Note the English
translations of the Tagalog unmarked-noun predicates in the following examples:Isda ang bakalaw.",[74]
"‘Heis a janitor
at their place.’has a job
there.’
A locative adverb consisting of sa plus an unmarked noun js usually translated by an English ‘at,’ ‘in,’ or‘on’ phrase; a locative adverb consisting of kina plus a personal noun is usually translated by ‘at
’s
(place)’; a locative adverb consisting of sa plus the sa form of a plural personal pronoun is usually translated
by a phrase of the shape ‘at our/your/their place’; the sa form of a deictic pronoun used as a locative adverb
is usually translated by ‘here’ (in the case of dine and dito) or ‘there’ (in the case of diyan and doont). (Sa
phrases of the shapeXay plus a personal noun, or of the shape sa plus a singular personal pronoun rarely
occur as locative adverbs.)
In a sentence with a verbal predicate, a sa phrase is sometimes ambiguously interpretable as a locative
adverb or as a directional complement. The sentence Suenulat siya sa mesa is an example of this kind ofambiguity:it may be interpreted as meaning ‘He wrote at the table,’ in which case sa mesa is interpreted asa locative adverb, or it may mean‘He wrote (directly) on the table (itself), in which case sa mesa isinterpreted as a directional complement. (It may be noted that Sumudlat siya sa mesa has two different
goal—focus counterparts, each of which is unambiguous: Pinagsulatan niya ang mesa ‘He wrote at the table’
and Sinulatan niya ang mesa ‘He wrote (directly) on the table (itself).” The first of these goal—focus
constructions involves the locative—focus counterpart of sumulat (cf. $5.9 for a treatment of locative
focus), while the second involves its directional—focus counterpart.)ADVERBIALS AND THEIR EXPANSIONS451There are also cases in which a sa phrase may be ambiguously interpreted either as a Jocative adverb
or as a locative adjective phrase (cf. §4.19) modifying a noun. The sentence Mabait ang batasa iskwela is an
example of this kind of ambiguity: it may mean ‘The child is well-behaved at school,’ in which case sa
iskwela is interpreted as a locative adverb, or it may mean ‘The child (who is) at school is well—behaved,’ in
which case sa iskwela is interpreted as a locative adjective phrase modifying bara. (In the latter
interpretation, bata sa iskwela represents an optional abbreviation of batang nasa iskwela ‘child (who is) at
school’ — cf. §3.14.)
Like the nasa of a locative adjective phrase, the sa of a locative adverb may be followed by a
positional phrase: a phrase consisting of a positional noun plus a mg phrase. (cf. §3.14 for a listing of
positional nouns.) A locative adverb that includes a positional phrase has the same English equivalent(s) as
the corresponding locative adjective phrase. Some examples are:
harap
Jabas
Nakita ko siya sang teatro.
likod
loob
in front of
outsidethe theatre.”","[561, 562]"
"While there is no doubt that educated Manila Tagalog now has five vowel phonemes, there are perhaps other
Tagalog dialects that still lack a phonemic distinction between /i/ and /e/ and between /u/ and /o/. And
even in the case of the educated Manila dialect, there are still many instances of interchangeability between
the members of these pairs of phonemes, as is explained in the appropriate sections below.§1.6. fi/.
The phoneme /i/ has two principal allophones: [i] and [/]. The allophone [i], an upper-high-front
spread vowel, is similar to the English vowel that occurs as the first element of a diphthong in ‘be* /biy/ or‘beat’ /biyt/. In English, this vowel is regularly followed by a forward and upward gliding movement of the
tongue (represented by /y/ in phonemic transcriptions of English). In Tagalog, on the other hand, there is
no /y/ glide regularly associated with [i].
The allophone [/] , a lower-high-front spread vowel, is similar to the vowel of English ‘bit’ /b/t/.
While the sounds [i] and (/] occur both in English and in Tagalog, the sounds play quite different
roles in the vowel systems of the two languages. In English the difference between the two sounds may beused in distinguishing two words from one another (e.g., ‘beat’ and “bit’). In Tagalog the difference between
the sounds is never used in this way, and any word in which one of the sounds occurs may be pronounced
with the other as well, with no change of meaning.",[17]
"Wala rito ang mgaNasa bukid.
kotse.(™ cows
aren’t here. They're at the farm.”
‘The carsThe third-person plural is occasionally used as a substitute for the second-person plural in addressing
one or more persons. Used in this way, the third-person plural indicates great respect and very marked
social distance. It was formerly used, for example, by subjects addressing monarchs, and might now be
used, especially in writing, by a humble citizen addressing an august politial personal.
The third-person plural is also occasionally used as a substitute for the third-person singular in
referring to a respected personage. Thus a child might use the third-person plural in referring to one of its
parents.
Thefollowinglist summarizes the correspondences discussed above between Tagalog and Englishpronouns. In the first column, the subject forms of the English pronouns are given, in the second the
ang-fonnTagalog equivalents. Infrequent Tagalog equivalents are written in parentheses. The symbol ¢indicates the absence of an overt equivalent:

sila,The ang forms and ng forms of the personal pronouns never occur with a marker. The sa forms, on
the other hand, are in most cases preceded by the marker sa. Sa regularly fails to occur before the sa form
of a pronoun only where the pronoun is used as a possessive modifier (cf. §3.20), and is optional when the
pronoun occurs in a possessive predicate (cf. §4.22) or after the comparative marker Kaysa (cf. §4.15). In
all other cases, sa obligatorily precedes the sa form of a personal pronoun.
(In certain specifiable cases, the ang and ng forms of the personal pronouns obligatorily occur in
sentence positions that are either distinct from those occupied by nominals of other types, or not
obligatory in the case of nominals of other types. Details are presented in §3.29.)§3.4.",[101]
"‘Why isn’t Ben happy today?’)184CHAPTER3Siya — which is, in these examples, an immediate part of the entire sentence — occurs after the first word ofthe sentence in cach case, whatever the grammatical function of this word. (In sentence (1), a basic
sentence, the first word is a predicate adjective; in sentence (2), the first word is a negator — cf. §7.13; in
sentence (3), the first word is an interrogative — cf. §7.10.) This behavior is notably different from that of
a non-enclitic nominal (such as si Ber).
Tagalog has enclitic words of two types: enclitic personal pronouns and enclitic particles. The
enclitic personal pronouns are discussed in the present section, the enclitic particles in § §6.2 through 6.6.
The sa forms of personal pronouns are never enclitic. The ang forms of personal pronouns (hereafter,
ang pronouns) are enclitic when they are used as topics, except that ang pronouns used as inverted topics(cf. §7.2) are non-enclitic. The sg forms of personal pronouns (hereafter, ng pronouns) are enclitic both as
actor complements and as possessive modifiers (cf. §3.20), as in:

*Ben isn’t his classmate.’

"{As was noted above, wika (phrase-finally /wi:ka’/, non-phrase-finally /wi:ka:/, with compensatory
lengthening of the final vowel (cf. § 1.12) is a literary or dialectal alternative to sabi. When the topic marker172CHAPTER 3ang is dcleted before it, wika is in some cases optionally contracted to Ka- /ka:/ or a fa:/, The ‘ke
contraction occurs before any ngform personal pronoun, the a- contraction before the ng form of a
third-person personal pronoun, or, less, commonly, before ng (spelled nang in this case) plus an unmarked
noun, ni(na) plus a personal noun, or the ng form of a deictic pronoun. Both ‘ka- and a- are treated asprefixes in conventional spelling. Thus:

"Tagalog sentences that include nominal or adjectival predicates may conveniently be grouped together
into a single class of EQUATIONALSENTENCES; sentences that include verbal predicates may be calledNARRATIONAL SENTENCES. Tagalog equational sentences differ from their English translation-equivalents in the following principal ways: (1) the absence of a linking verb like English be; (2) the absence,
in the case of indefinite nominal predicates, of an indefinite article like English a/an; (3) word order, theTagalog predicate being sentencc-initial, the English predicate sentence-final. The first of these differences
applies in all cases: the equivalent of be in Tagalog is simply the cquational structure itself, the nominal or
adjectival predicate plus the topic. (An equational sentence may be translated with a present or a past form
of English be, according to the context.) The second of the differences docs not apply in the case of
adjectival predicates (or in the case of marked-nominal or definite predicates — cf. §2.4 for a discussion of
marked nominals, and §7.17 for a discussion of definitization of the predicate).
The third difference between Tagalog cquational sentences andtheirEnglishtranslationequivalents — word order — exists in the case of all basic equational sentences. But Tagalog does have
certain non-basic sentence types, both equational and narrational, in which the topic precedes the predicate
(cf. §7.2).
Tagalog narrational sentences fail to correspond to their English translation-equivalents in a variety of
ways, some of which have already been mentioned. The difference between English and Tagalog in the
order of the components of basic sentences obtains in the case of narrational, as in that of equational
sentences. And, as was noted above, the subject of an English narrational sentence frequently corresponds
to part of the Tagalog predicate.",[71]
"When the first of two potential coordinates is expressed by a personal pronoun and the second by a
nominal other than a personal pronoun, Tagalog in some cases allows, in others requires, the use of a116CHAPTER 3SPECIAL COORDINATE CONSTRUCTION in place of the coordinate construction with at. This special
coordinate construction consists of a plural personal pronoun followed by a ng phrase (ng plus anunmarked noun, ni or nina plus a personal noun, or the ng form of a deictic). If the underlying pronoun is
singular, the pronoun in the resultant sentence is its plural counterpart. Thus from the underlying sentences
Nakita ko siya ‘| saw him’ and Nakita ko si Juan ‘| saw Juan’ is derived:
Nakita ko sila ni Juan.","[125, 126]"
"(Since the latter order is frequently ambiguous — the example just given might mean ‘little Maria’s child’ as
well as ‘Maria's little child’ — the order in which the ng phrase follows any other modifiers of the head noun
is often preferable.)138CHAPTER 3To express the equivalent of an English emphatic possessive construction with ‘own’ — e.g.. ‘my
own’ — Tagalog uses either a ng-possessive or a sa-possessive modification construction whose head is sarili
‘own, self: e.g.,
Sarili ko
ang bahay.
Aking sarili‘The house is my own.”
As in other cases, the ng- and sa- possessive constructions are equally common only when the possessor is
expressed by a personal pronoun. When the possessor is expressed by something other than a personal
pronoun, the mg-possessive construction is preferred. Thus ‘The house is Juan’s own’ would normally be:Sarili ni Juan ang bahay.
Emphatic possessive constructions with sarili may themselves be used as modifiers, in which case the
linker na/-ng connects the sarili construction to the word or phrase expressing the thing possessed. Whenused as modifiers, emphatic-possessive constructions normally precede the linker:
sarili kong bahay.
Ito ang
aking sariling bahay.
‘This is my own house.”","[147, 148]"
"‘Where is my pencil?’
but not:sa aking lapis?
*Nasaan ang
lapis na akin?
Of the two occurring possessive modificationconstructionsthat involve sa forms of personalpronouns, the one in which the pronoun precedes the linker (¢.g., aking lapis) is very much more commonthan the one in which the pronoun follows the linker (e.g., lapis na sa akin). The construction in which the
pronoun precedes the linker is, in fact, the only commonly used sa-possessive modification construction.
Whenthe possessoris expressed by something other than a pronoun, there is a strong preference for theng-possessive construction, to be presented later in this section.
The third type of possessive modification construction to be dealt with has the following structure:eg.,Head (Possessor)LinkerModifier (Thing Possessed)Nounna/-ngAdjective + ang + Nounbatang bago ang lapis
‘child with the new pencil’136CHAPTER 3This construction differs from the two previously discussed in several ways: it does not allow alternative
word order, and its head and modifier are not directly referable to the topic and predicate of an underlying
constituent sentence. From the point of view of meaning, however, the construction is similar to a
construction with a modifying may phrase that includes within it a modifying adjective: e.g.,
batang may bagong lapis
‘child with a new pencil’
But, while the construction with may generally expresses the thing possessed as indefinite (note the
translation with ‘a’ rather than ‘the’), the construction under discussion always expresses the thing
possessed as definite.
Note that the modifier in this construction has the shape of an ordinary equational
sentence — adjective + ang + noun. Further examples of the construction are:bulaklak na mahaba ang tangkay
‘flower with the long stem’
babaeng berde ang baro
‘woman with the green dress’
doktor na malaki ang bahay
‘doctor with the big house’The fourth type of possessive modification construction to be dealt with has the shape:
Head (Thing Possessed)
Noun
C.g.,Modifier (Possessor)
ng Phraselapis ng bata
the‘child’s pencil’
a
(As in other cases, ng phrase is to be understood as a cover term for: ng plus an unmarked noun; ni or ninaplus a personal noun; the ng form of a personal or deictic pronoun.)
This construction differs from the three previously presented possessive modification constructions in
that it does not include the linker na/-ng, and differs from the first two in that its components are notdirectly referable to an underlying constituent sentence, and in the general nonreversibility of its
components. (The ng form of a personal pronoun may, however, in certain cases precede a noun expressing
the thing possessed; see below.)
The possessive-ng-phrase construction is the most common Tagalog translation equivalent of Englishpossessive modification constructions involving the possessive suffix-’s, or involving ‘of: ang buntot ng aso
‘the dog’s tail’, ‘the tail of the dog’. Only when the possessor is a pronoun (expressed in English by my,your, etc.) is the sa-possessive construction equally common:fekine lapis
lapis ko
‘my pencil’A possessive ng phrase never begins the construction in which it occurs. When the possessor is
expressed by the ng form of a personal pronoun, however, and a modifying adjective precedes the wordNOMINALS AND THEIR EXPANSIONS137that represents the thing possessed, the pronoun may follow the adjective and precede the noun. Thus, analternative to:
maliit na anak ko‘my little child.’
there is also:maliit kong anak.
(Note that in the second construction the linker follows the pronoun.) Some further examples are:
bagong baro mo—bago mong baro
‘your new dress’asul na sombrero niya——asul niyang sombrero
‘his blue hat’mahusay na titser natin—emahusay nating titser
‘our good teacher’malakas na boses ninyo—_—_—malakas ninyong boses
‘your loud voices’tamad na kapatid nila—_—_—tamad nilang kapatid
*their lazy brother’(This construction involves ENCLITIC behavior of personal pronouns — cf. §3.29.)In all other cases, a ng form of a personal pronoun used as a possessive modifier immediately follows
the word representing the thing possessed, whether or not another modifier is also present. Thus:anak kong maliit
‘my little child’
never:
*anak na maliit ko.
A possessive ng phrase other than the ng form of a personal pronoun always follows the word
representing the thing possessed, but another modifier may occur between this word and the ng phrase.
Thus:
anak na maliit ni Maria
‘Maria‘s little child*as well as:
anak ni Marsiang maliit.","[145, 146, 147]"
"5PRONUNCIATION§1.3. Phonemes.
Every language makes use of a considerable variety of speech sounds. Not all of the differences among
the sounds that occur in a language, however, are used to distinguish words of the language from oneanother. In English, for example, the initial consonant sounds of the words goose and geese are not
identical in their articulation. The point of articulation of the first is the velum; that of the second, the hard
palate. But the difference in articulation between these sounds never constitutes the only difference
between two English words. In the other hand, the difference between the initial consonant sounds of glass
and class (the first is voiced, the second voiceless) can, and often does, constitute the only difference
between two English words.
From the point of view of their function in distinguishing the words of a language from one another,the speech sounds of a language arrange themselves into a system of contrasting classes. These contrasting
classes are called the PHONEMES of the language. Two speech sounds of a language belong to the same
phoneme if, first, they cannot constitute the only difference between two words, and, second, they have a
certain degree of articulatory similarity to one another. Both requirements are met by the initial sounds ofgoose and geese (which are similar in being voiced stops), and the two sounds thus belong to a single English
phoneme. Two speech sounds of a language belong to different phonemes whenever the difference between
them may constitute the only difference between two words. Thus the initial consonant sounds of glass and
class belong to two different English phonemes.","[13, 14]"
"Nor is the same flexibility present in the case of sentences that include the ne form of a personal pronoun
used as an actor complement. Thus there is a grammatical sentence:
Nakita niya si Ben.",[193]
"The term sa phrase designates the following structures:themarker sa plus an unmarked noun or plus the sa form of a personal pronoun; the marker kay plus a personal

there.’BASIC SENTENCE STRUCTURE77A directional complement that consists of sa plus an unmarked noun may in most cases be translated
with cither a definite or indefinite noun phrase in English. (To express a meaning of indefiniteness
unambiguously within a sa complement, isa ‘one/a‘ plus the linker ma/-ng (cf. §3.11) is inserted before the
noun. Thus:
Bumalik sa isang gulsali ang bata.
‘The child returned to a building.’To express a meaning of definiteness unambiguously within a sa complement, the noun within the sa
complement is modified in some way (cf. §3.11, ff.). Thus:
Bumalik sa gusaling iyon ang bata.
‘The child retumed to that building.’)
Since the topic usually corresponds to a definite noun phrase in English and a directional complement
frequently does so, it is not always easy for an English translation to reveal the difference between an
actor-focus construction with a directional complement and a directional-focus construction with an actor
complement. For example, the Tagalog equivalent of ‘The child returned to the building’ may be either an
actor-focus construction with a directional complement:
Bumialik sa gusali ang bata.or a directional-focus construction with an actor complement:
Binalikan ng bata ang gusali.
The two Tagalog sentences differ in focus, in the element that is the center of attention. While a differenceof this kind may be shown in English — ¢.g., by intonation (‘The child returned to the building’ versus ‘The
child retumed to the building’), there are many cases in which, in fact, it is not shown.","[86, 87]"
"Within a nominalized verbal (cf. §3.24), an object complement is in some cases expressed by a ng
phrase, in others by asa phrase, and in still others may be expressed by either a ng phrase or a sa phrase.
Only a ng phrase may be used if the verb within the nominalized verbal is a double—object verb. Once more
the ng phrase must be either ng plus an unmarked noun or the ng form of a deictic pronoun: ¢.g.,ng premyo)
Siya ang nagbigaykay Ben.
nito{( a/the prize
‘He’s the one who gaveto Ben.’
} (some of) that|As the above translations show, a ng phrase object complement within a nominalized verbal may be either
definite or indefinite in reference.
If the verb within the nominalized verbal is an object verb, and if the nominal within the object
complement is a personal noun or a personal pronoun, only a sa phrase (Kay plus personal noun, sa plus
sa-form personal pronoun) may be used to express the object complement:e¢.g.,{ kay Jose.",[393]
"‘Il wrote with something.’Pinagsulatan ko ang desk.
‘I wrote (it) on the desk.’)Ipinangsulat ko ang lapis.
‘I wrote with the pencil.’)(Instead of an inflected form of a verb, an indefinite may phrase may include a pseudo-verb — ef.
§4.21 — followed by the linker ng and the basic form of a goal-focus verb. Some examples are:
ayawkailangang
Maydapat
gustong
ibiggawin si Juan.doesn’t want to do anything.”
necds‘Juanought
wantsto do something.”wants
An indefinite may phrase may include, in addition to the verb (and its complements other than anactor-complement), a noun that partially specifies the person, thing, place, etc., to which the verb refers.
This noun may cither precede or follow the verb (or verb phrase). In either case, the linker na/-ng
immediately precedes the second clement. As was mentioned above, the English equivalent of a sentence
whose predicate is an indefinite may phrase introduced by may or mayroon often includes an indefinite
pronoun or adverb. When a specifying noun is present, however, the English equivalent normally includes,
instead of an indefinite pronoun or adverb, an indefinite noun phrase:
or ‘some’ plus a noun. Thus:that is, a phrase consisting of ‘a/an'istudyanteng dumating
kahapon.",[288]
"NOMINALS AND THEIR EXPANSIONS183§3.29.Enclitic personal pronouns.
The present section is concerned with certain peculiarities shown by personal pronouns, as compared
with nominals of other types, with respect to the positions they occupy in sentences. (The forms and
meanings of the personal pronouns are presented in §3.3.)
As was noted in §2.15, the order of non-initial components of basic sentences is in most cases not
fixed. Thus, for example, a sentence topic and an actor complement may, in general, occur in either
order:¢.g.,{Nakita si Ben ni Pedro
Nakita ni Pedro si Ben.
‘Pedro saw Ben.”
(In both sentences si Ber is the topic, ni Pedro the actor complement.) This same flexibility of word order
is not found in the case of sentences (either basic or derived) whose topic is the ang form of a personalpronoun. For example, while the following sentence is grammatical —
Nakita siya ni Pedro.","[192, 193]"
"In the sections that follow, simple modification constructions are dealt with first. Since the head of asimple modification construction is, by definition, a noun or a pronoun (corresponding to the topic of a
basic sentence), the various simple constructions may be classified and discussed on the basis of the kinds of
modifiers involved. Simple modification constructions headed by personal pronouns and personal nouns,
however, have certain peculiarities that warrant separate discussion. In the sections that follow, the simplemodification constructions of Tagalog are presented in the following order: noun head with noun modifier
in §3.12; noun head with one-word-adjective modifier in §3.13; noun head with phrase modifier in §3.14;
modification of personal pronouns in §3.15; modification of personal nouns in §3.16. (For examples of
modification constructions with nominalized adjectivals and verbals as heads, cf. §3.24.) Complex
modification constructions are presented in §3.17.
Like English, Tagalog distinguishes betweenmodificationconstructions involving RESTRICTIVEmodifiers and those involving NONRESTRICTIVE modifiers. A restrictive modifier is one that limits the
reference of the head with which it occurs. A nonrestrictive modifier is one that merely gives information
about the head. Some English examples may clarify the distinction. Compare:a. ‘The students who worked hard passed.”
b. ‘The students, who worked hard, passed.”
Both sentences contain modification constructions whose head is ‘students’ and whose modifier is ‘who
worked hard’. The modifier in sentence a is restrictive, and limits the reference of the head. Thus thesentence does not say that the students as a group passed, but rather that those students with the quality
expressed by the restrictive modifier — namely, those who worked hard — passed. The modifier in sentence
b on the other hand, is nonrestrictive and merely gives information about the head. Thus sentence bsays
that the students as a group passed, and gives some information about the students: namely, that theyworked hard.
Most of the Tagalog modification constructions to be dealt with in §§3.12 through 3.17 involve
restrictive modifiers. Modification constructions involving nonsestrictive modifiers have, as a group, certain
distinctive formal characteristics that warrant separate treatment, and are dealt with in §3.18.
Finally, §§3.19 and 3.20 deal with the two classes of modification constructions that either do not
involve the device of linking at all or do not involve the device in all cases: modification constructions withadverbial modifiers (§3.19) and possessive modification constructions (§ 3.20).
§3.12. Modification constructions: noun head with noun modifier.
In this and the following two sections, NOUN is used as a cover term for unmarked nouns and deictic
pronouns. (Note that the term noun, as used in these sections, does not include personal pronouns orpersonal nouns.)120CHAPTER 3Anyequationalsentencewitha nounpredicateand a noun topic may serve as the constituentsentence of a modification construction of the shape noun + linker (na/-ng) + noun. Thus corresponding to
sentences such as Repolyo ang gulay ‘The vegetable (dish) is (made from) cabbage’ and Besbol ang laro ‘The
game is baseball’, there are modification constructions such as gulay na repolyo ‘vegetable dish made from
cabbage’ and darong besbol “baseball game’.","[129, 130]"
"When, however, it is something other than a personal pronoun, it may optionally be moved to a position
after the basic form. Thus Gustong mangisda ni Bob is an optional variant of Gusto ni Bob (na) mangisda.
When the topic of a goal-focus basic form in this construction is a personal pronoun, it is enclitic tothe pseudo-verb (cf. §3.29), and is obligatorily moved to a position before the linker. Thus:
Gusto ko siyang tawagin.
‘I want to call him.”
not:
*Gusto kong tawagin siya.
When the topic of a goal-focus basic form is something other than a personal pronoun, it may optionally bemoved to a position before the linker. The pre-linker position is common in the case of personal-name and
deictic-pronoun topics, less common in the case of unmarked-noun topics. Examples are:
{ si Juang
iyongGusto kotawagin.ang doktor (na)

"Tagalog has LOCATIVE PHRASES (phrases expressing location) of two classes: LOCATIVE
ADJECTIVE PHRASES and LOCATIVE ADVERBIAL PHRASES. Locative adjective phrases are discussed
in the present section; locative adverbial phrases are discussed in §6.9.
Locative adjective phrases normally consist of a /na‘/ plus a sa phrase. When the nominal in the sa
phrase is an unmarked noun or (the sa form of) a personal pronoun, na and sa are conventionally written asa single word:
nasa kusina‘in the kitchen’‘with you’
nasa iyo‘in your possession’255ADJECTIVES AND THEIR EXPANSIONSWhen the nominal in the sa phrase is a personal noun,sa is replaced by Xay (or its plural counterpart kina),
and na is conventionally written as a separate word:
‘with Nena’
na kay Nena
‘in Nena’s possession’{wien Nena and her friends’
na kina Nena
lin the possession of Nena and her friends’
When the nominal in the sa phrase is a deictic pronoun, the sa form of a deictic is used. As was noted in
§3.4, the sa forms of the deictics are: dine, dito, diyan and doon. In locative-adjective phrases, either theinitial /d/ of the deictic is replaced by /r/ (a common phonemic alternation -— cf. §1.20) or an /n/ is
inserted between na and the initial /d/ of the deictic. The two formations alternate freely for most speakers.
Thus:
narine /na‘ri‘neh/)
‘here’nandine jna-ndi-neh/ |narito /na‘ritoh/
‘here’
nandito /na‘ndi’toh/naryan /na‘ryan/
‘there’nandyan /na‘ndyan/
naroon /na‘ru'on/
‘there’
nandoon /na‘ndu’on/In addition to the above formations, there are formations of identical meaning involving duplicating
syllables. These formations are:
naririne /na‘ri(-)ri‘neh/
‘here’
nandidine /na‘ndi(-)di-neh/
naririto /na‘ri(‘)ritoh/
‘here*
nandidito /na‘ndi(‘)di‘toh/
nariryan /na‘ri(*)ryan/)
‘there’nandidyan /na‘ndi(*)dyan/ fnaruroon /na‘ru(‘)rv’on/‘there’(Vowel length in the duplicating syllable is optional in all cases. There is no duplicated form corresponding
to nandoon in educated Manila Tagalog.)256CHAPTER4When the nominal in the locative phrase is an unmarked noun representing a place or an inanimate
object, the phrase is usually equivalent to an English phrase introduced by ‘in’, ‘on’, ‘at’, etc.
Nasa Maynila ang gusali.
‘The building is in Manila.’
Nasa mesa ang libro.
‘The book is on the table.’Nasa opisina si Esting.
‘Esting is at/in the office.’
(May may be inserted between nasa and the noun to indicate approximate location:e.g.,Nasa may Baguio ang gusali.
vicinity of Baguio.”
‘The building is in the
Baguio area.” )When the nominal is an unmarked noun representing a person, or is a personal pronoun or a personal
noun, the phrase has one of several English equivalents. If the referent of the topic is animate, the phrase
may often be translated by a ‘with’ phrase in English: c.g.,
Nasa babaeNasa akin.ang sanggol.","[264, 265, 266]"
"}Mayroon akong bangka.
‘I have a boat.""
A possessive phrase introduced by snarami expresses possession of a large quantity or number of anobject. As in the case of phrases introduced by mayroon, the object(s) possessed may be expressed either
by the sg form of a deictic pronoun or by an unmarked noun preceded by the linker -ng. (Once more, any
enclitic particles or pronouns obligatorily precede the linker.) Some examples are:
Marami noon si Juan.
‘Juan has a lot of that/those.”
Maraming pera si Juan.
‘Juan has a lot of money.”",[285]
"Thediscussion covers only those forms of the complements that occur in basic sentences. (Those forms of the
complements that do not occur in basic sentences
— viz., the sa-pronoun actor complement and the
sa-phrase object complement — are presented in §5.25.)
(1). The actor complement.
An actor complement may occur with any object-focus or
directional-focus verb, whether the verb is single-object or double-object. In basic sentences, the actorcomplement is expressed by a ng PHRASE. The term ng phrase designates the following structures: the
marker ng (/nax/) plus an unmarked noun; the marker ni plus a personal noun, the ag form of a personal or
deictic pronoun. (A ng form is so labeled because it occurs in some of the same contexts‘as structures that
include ag.) The ng forms of the personal pronouns are:
ko
nita
moa
‘you and I/we’
‘you’namin
natin
ninyo‘Land others/we’
‘you and I (and others)/we’
‘you (and others)’niya‘he/she’nila‘he and others/she and others/they’The ng forms of the deictic pronouns are:

‘this’niyan
niyon/noon“that?
‘that’Some examples of basic sentences with actor complements are:ng modista

‘He
‘That oneBASIC SENTENCE STRUCTURE15An actor complement that consists of ug plus an unmarked noun is sometimes translated in English
by a definite noun phrase (i.e., a phrase introduced by ‘the’), sometimes by an indefinite noun phrase (i.e.,
a phrase introduced by ‘a/an* or ‘some’). This:
Ginising ng ingay ang bata.may mican cither ‘A noise awakened the child’ or ‘The noise awakened the child’. (In most cases, however, a
ng-plus-unmarked-noun actor complement in itself suggests a meaning of definiteness, and indefiniteness is
indicated unambiguously only by the insertion of isa ‘one/a’ plus the linker na/-ng (cf. §3.11) before thenoun. Thus:
Ginawa ng modista ang baro.
‘The dressmaker made the dress.”
but:Ginawa ng isang modista ang baro.
*A dressmaker made the dress.”)
Marked-noun actor complements are necessarily definite, because of the definite meanings of markednouns themselves.
(2). The object complement. An object complement may occur with an actor-focus object verb or
double-object verb or with a directional-focus double-object verb. In basic sentences, the object
complement is expressed by ang phrase, which must be either ng plus an unmarked noun or the ng form ofa deictic pronoun. (Personal pronouns and personal nouns do not occur as object complements in basic
sentences. Their occurrence as object complements in certain derived sentences is discussed in §5.25.)
Some examples of basic sentences with object complements are:ng estudyante
Pumiliang titser.
noon
a student.’‘The teacher chose
some of that.’
ng pagkainNagdalasa handaan ang Nanay.
nitosome food
‘Mother broughtto the party.’
some of this
ng karneInabutan koang bisita.
niyansome meat
“I passedto the guest.”
some of that16CHAPTER 2An object complement that consist of ag plus an unmarked noun is normally indefinite in meaning,
and is translated by an English noun phrase that includes an indefinite article. The ng form of a deictic
pronoun also has, as object complement, an indefinite meaning: e.g., ‘some of this/that’.
(3). The directional complement. A directional complement may occur with an actor-focus
directional verb or double-object verb, or with an object-focus double-object verb. The directional
complementis expressed by a Sa PHRASE.","[84, 85, 86]"
"The Tagalog counterpart of the English reflexive pronouns is identical in shape with the emphatic
possessive construction discussed in §3.20: viz., a possessive modification construction whose head is sarili
‘self, own’ and whose modifier is either the zg form or the sa form of a personal pronoun. As in the case ofother possessive modification constructions, the ng form follows the head without linking, while the sa
form precedes the head and is joined to it by the linker na-/-ng. Thus:
sarili ko
‘myself?
aking sarili
Some examples of the use of reflexive constructions in sentences are:
sarili ko.",[148]
"The phoneme /f/ occurs only in words borrowed into Tagalog from other languages, notably Spanish
and English. In the case of borrowings from Spanish, all EMT speakers agree in retaining /f/ in the case ofpersonal names: e.g., Fe /fech/, Flora {Morrah/, Fortunato {fortunaetoh/, In the case of Spanish loan-words
other than personal names, there is less agreement. Some speakers retain the Spanish /f{/ with great
consistency, others replace /f/ by /p/ with equal consistency, and still others use /f/ in some instances, /p/
in others, Some words in which both /f/ and /p/ are heard are:Pilipinoffilipi-noh/or{pilipi-noh/‘Filipino’fresco

Tagalog fs/ is, in most of its occurrences, similar to the /s/ of English ‘sing’, ‘sang’, ete.:the alveolarfricative [s). Before /y/, Tagalog /s/ has a PALATALIZED allophone {sY}. (A palatalized sound is one in
in addition to the main articulation of the sound, there is a raising of the front of the tongue toward thehard palate.) This [s¥] is a sound that is intermediate between [s] and the sound represented by sir (the
post-alveolar fricative [$]) in English words like ‘ship’ or ‘shop’. It occurs both in loan words and in native
Tagalog words. In loan words from English, the sequence /sy/(=)[s¥] replaces English /§/ at the beginnings
of words. Thus the following Joan words have /sy/:shopIsyarp/siyaperon{sya*peron{shineIsyaryn{‘chaperone’Elsewhere, the usual replacement of English /S/ is /s/:c.g.,
brush
machine gun
marshmallow/bravs/
/masiengan/
/masrsmaloh/The sequence /sy/ also occurs in certain loan words from Spanish, ¢.g., siyudad /syudad/ ‘city’.",[31]
"Sasabihan niya ako ng lahat.
‘He will tell me every thing.”)me, “I don’t have any money.”””(d) Direct-quotation clauses occur as predicates opposite QUOTATION TAGS in topic position. A
quotation tag consists of a SPEECH! NOUN —i.c., a noun that designates the product of an act of
specch — plus a mg phrase that designates the spcaker(s). The most common speech noun is sabi (literally,‘something said/told’). (Sabi, like most other speech nouns, also occurs as the base of a set of verbs that
designate the act of which the noun itself designates the product: cf. magsabi/sabihin/sabihan ‘say/tell’.)
Some other speech nouns are: ayon (literally, ‘something said in agreement’), sagot ‘answer’, sigaw
(literally, ‘something shouted’), fanong ‘question’, ufos ‘order’, wika (literally, ‘language’ — a literary ordialectal alternative to sabi), and yaya ‘invitation’.
In some cases speech nouns are translatable by nouns in English: ¢.g.,
“Saan ka pupunta?” ang tanong niya.",[180]
"Nais
Ayaw
( need‘Welike/wantthat.’don’t like/wantIf the pseudo-verb is gusto or ayaw, an animate definite object (person or animal) may — or, in some
cases, for some speakers, must — be expressed by a sa phrase (sa plus an unmarked noun or plus the sa form
of a personal pronoun, kay/kina plus a personal noun, or the sa form of a deictic pronoun). Thus most
speakers may use either an ang phrase or a sa phrase to express the definite object in such sentences as:ang
Gusto ni Pedrotitser.
sa‘Pedro likes the teacher.’{ ang
Ayaw ni Pedrotitser.sa
‘Pedro doesn’t like the teacher.”
(Some speakers allow the replacement of the ang phrase by asa phrase only after ayaw. For these speakers,
‘Pedro likes the teacher’ cannot be expressed by Gusto ni Pedro sa titser.)For many speakers the replacement of the ang phrase by a sa phrase after ayaw is obligatory if the
definite objectis expressedby a personal noun or personal pronoun.",[273]

The word that an enclitic follows (either immediately or after one or more other enclitics) within a
given construction may be called the PRE-ENCLITIC WORD (hereafter, P). In sentences cited thus far, P

There are, however, cases in which P is preceded by one or more other words. Any word that precedes P in
a given construction is a NON-PRE-ENCLITIC (hereafter, N). An inventory of common words, word
classes, and structures that function as N with respect to enclitic pronouns is given below. (The inventory
does not apply in all cases to enclitic particles, since certain sentence elements that function as N withrespect to enclitic pronouns may function as P with respect to the particles —cf. §6.6.) From this
inventory the position of P (with respect to pronouns) in any given construction may be determined, since
P is always the first word of the construction that is not N.","[196, 197]"
"The Tagalog counterpart of a construction involving an English intensive pronoun (and of certain
other English constructions -- see below) is a construction involving the intensifier mismo. Mismo may be
used to intensify any marked noun, and any unmarked noun preceded by ang, ng, or sa. (It is, however, less
common with ng phrases than with eng or sa phrases.) Afiseno does not occur with unmarked nouns in
predicate position unless the nouns are definitized by a preceding ang (cf. §7.17).
Mismo may cither precede or follow a sentence-initial marked noun. (In the case of personal nouns,mismo either precedes the personal-noun marker or follows the noun.) When mismo precedes, it is linked to
the nominal by the linker 2a@/-1g; when it follows, no linker occurs. Thus:({Mismong ako)_)Ako mismo4| Mismong ito

alot§4.24.",[290]
"Marked nouns.
As was stated in §2.4,a MARKED NOUNis so called because its sentence function is always marked,either by its own form or by the form of a preceding marker. Every marked noun occurs in three different
forms or with three different markers, each form or marker indicating a particular set of sentence functions.
The three forms (of the marked noun itself or of the preceding marker) are called: the ang form, the ng
form, and the sa form. Ang forms (or nouns preceded by ang-form markers) occur as predicates or topics:
ng forms (or nouns preceded by ng-form markers) occur as verb complements or possessive modifiers (sce
§3.19), and in general, in all other contexts in which ng-plus-unmarked-noun phrases may occur:sa forms

"The four interrogative words to be presented in this section all function as substitutes for
phrases: adjectival phrases in the case of masaan; adverbial phrases in the case of bakit and kailan; and
adjectival, adverbial, or directional—complement phrases in the case of saan. All of them except kailan
alternate with phrases that include ano (cf. §7.8): nasaan with nasa ano; bakit with dahil sa ano; and saan
with sa ano. The one—word interrogatives are more often used than the ano phrases.
Nasaan ‘where’ is the interrogative counterpart of an adjectival nasa phrase (cf. § 4.19), except where
the noun in the phrase represents a human being, in which case nakanino is used (cf. §7.9). Examples ofDERIVED AND MINOR SENTENCE STRUCTURES$13the use of nasaan are:

"May libro ang babae.
‘The woman has a book..’)When the nominal in a locative adjective phrase is a deictic pronoun, the phrase is equivalent to ‘here’
or ‘in/at this place’ or to ‘there’ or ‘in/at that place’. (The four categories of deictics show the same meaning
differences in locative phrases that they show elsewhere — cf. §3.4). Thus:
Narito si Juan.

‘Juan is
infat this place.’
Naroon si Juan.
{ there.’
‘Juan is
( in/at that place.’A locative deictic is often used as the first clement (and head) of a modification construction, in
which case it is followed by asa phrase. (As was noted in §3.12, the sa form of a deictic, when it occurs as
the head of a modification construction, is followed by a sa phrase, rather than by a linker-plus-modifier
construction.) For example:
Narito sa Maynila si Juan.
‘Juan is here in Manila.”
Whenthe locative deictic in sucha construction is maroon (or one of its variants), the demonstrativemeaning of the deictic is often negligible, and the construction is more or less identical in meaning with a
locative construction lacking a deictic: e.g.,
Naroon sa Maynila si Juan.
‘Juan is (there) in Manila.’258CHAPTER 4In addition to simple nominals (and nominalizations), the sa within a locative adjective phrase may be
followed by a POSITIONAL PHRASE. A positional phrase consists of one of a small group of unmarked
nouns — which may be called POSITIONAL NOUNS — and ang phrase. Some common positional nouns

"BASIC SENTENCE STRUCTURE81If, on the other hand, the 2g pronoun is disyllabic and the ang pronoun is the monosyllabic ka, ka
precedes the ng pronoun. Thus:
Binigyan ka nila ng salapi.
‘They gave you some moncy.’
Finally, if both the ng pronoun and the ang pronoun are monosyllabic — ko and ka are the only potentialcombinationthat fits the description — a special composite pronoun kita, which has the meaning ‘I(actor)-you (goal)’, is used:e.g.,Binigyan kita ng salapi.
‘I gave you some money.’
In all cases, the topic pronoun obligatorily precedes any complement other than ang pronoun. There is, for
example, no:*Binigyan nila ng salapi ako.
(Topics other than personal pronouns may actually, in most cases, either precede or follow a verb
complement that is not a ng form of a personal pronoun. Thus, in addition to the sentences listed earlier,
there are sentences like
ang babae
Bumilisi Rosa
iyonng bigas.","[90, 91]"
"Nobela ang
nasa mesang libro.
‘The book on the table is a novel.”
An abbreviated alternative to a head-linker-modifier construction may occur whenever the modifier is
a reservational, partisanship or purpose phrase of the shape para + sa + noun (cf. §4.20) or a locative phrase
of the shape na + sa + noun (cf. §4.19). In the case of a para-sa-phrase modifier, the abbreviation consists in
the deletion of the linker, so that the resultant constructions has the shape: head + para + sa + noun. If, forexample, the linker is deleted from regalong para sa titser ‘present for the teacher’, what remains is regalo
para sa titser, which has exactly the same meaning. In the case of a locative-phrase modifier, the
abbreviation consists in the deletion of both the linker and the na of the locative phrase, so that the
resultant construction has the shape: head + sa + noun. If, for example, the linker and the na are deleted
from librong nasa mesa ‘book on the table’, what remains is libro sa mesa which has exactly the same
meaning. Some further examples of abbreviated para-sa-phrase-modifier and locative-modifier constructionsare given below. In each case the full form of the construction, which includes the linker (and, in the case
of locative modifiers, the na of the locative phrase), is given above the abbreviated form:
titser na para sa ikalawang mt
Sino ang
titser para sa ikalawang grado?
‘Who is the teacher for the second grade?’

"§1.30 Spelling and pronunciation.
Written Tagalog uses the same letters as does written English. The seven letters c, f,j,q,v, x, and z,however, occur chiefly in proper nouns of foreign origin and in certain other borrowings from English or
Spanish; for example:
cfCarlos
Cavite(man's name)
(place name)camera‘camera’Fe
San Felipe
mag-fishing(woman's name)

‘tax""These seven letters are not included in the conventional Tagalog alphabet, which consists of twentyletters, in the following order:
abkdefhilmnngoprstuwy
(Note that ug is conventionally considered a single Ictter.)Tagalog spelling is very much more consistent than English spelling in reflecting pronunciation.
Except in the case of certain borrowed words, and in a few other cases to be noted below, each of the
above twenty letters is consistently used to represent a single phoneme, and each phoneme is consistently
represented by a single Ietter.","[65, 66]"
"“According to whom is he coming tomorrow?’
Kanino is also used as a possessive modifier, with the linker na/-ng. For example:
Kaninong sombrero iyan?
‘Whose hat is that?’(The kanino and nino possessive—modifier constructions are equally common.)
Nakanino, like the nasa + human noun constructions for which it is a substitute (cf. §4.19), differs inmeaning according to whether the topic with which it occurs represents an object or a person. In the former
case, nakanino means ‘in whose possession’; in the latter case, it means ‘in whose care’ or ‘at whose place.’
Nakanino ba ang kotse?
“Who's got the car?”
Nakanino ba ang sanggol?
‘Who's looking after the baby?’§7.10.",[624]
"In Tagalog too, nonrestrictive modifiers constitute separate intonation phrases while restrictive modifiers
normally do not:ang mga mag-aaral, na nagtrabaho nang masikap,... (two phrases)
‘the students, who worked hard...’vs.ang mga mag-aaral na nagtrabaho nang masikap... (one phrase)
‘the students who worked hard...’Another similarity between English and Tagalog nonrestrictive modifiers is that, in both languages,
such modifiers always follow their heads. Thus the reversibility of head and modifier that has been ascribed,
in preceding sections, to Tagalog modification constructions as a group does not apply in cases when themodifier is nonrestrictive. In all cases of nonrestrictive modification, the head is the first element of the
construction, the modifier the second.
The fact that a nonrestrictive modifier always constitutes a separate intonation phrase, and is
consequently preceded by a pause, has consequences for the shape of the linker a-/-ng in nonrestrictive132CHAPTER 3modification. As was noted in §3.11, only the /na/ form of the linker occurs after a pause, whatever may
be the final consonant of the independent form of the pre-pausal word. Therefore, in cases where the /n/
form of the linker occurs before a restrictive modifier (i.¢., cases where the preceding word ends, in its
independent form, in /h/, /*/, or /n/), there is, in addition to the pause, a second formal distinction between
modification
constructions
involving nonrestrictive
modifiers
and
those
involving
restrictive
modifiers: namely, the distinction between the /na/ and the /n/ forms of the linker. Thus:
ang mga ¢studyante, na nagtrabaho nang masikap‘the students, who worked hard’
vs.ang mga estudyanteng nagtrabaho nang masikap
‘the students who worked hard’There are certain types of structures that may serve freely as restrictive modifiers but that either do
not occur or occur rarely as nonrestrictive modifiers. Unmarked nouns, for example, do not occur as
nonrestrictive modifiers unless they themselves are modified. Thus, while there are restrictive constructions
like ang guro kong Amerikana ‘my American teacher’ or ‘my teacher who is an American’, there are no
constructions like “ang guru ko, na Amerikana. (To express the equivalent of ‘my teacher, who is anAmerican’, Tagalog requires the use of isa ‘one/a(n)' plus linker within the nonsestrictive modifier: ang
guro ko, na isang Amerikana.)
.
One-word adjectives occur rarcly if at all as nonrestrictive modifiers, except when the adjectives are
intensified. (Cf. §4.12 for the intensification of adjectives.) While constructions like ang guro ko, na
napakahusay or ang guro ko, na mahusay na mahusay ‘my teacher, who is very good’ are quite acceptable(napakahusay and mahusay na mahusay are doth intensifications of mahusay ‘good’), constructions like ang
guro ko, na mahusay are of questionable grammaticalness.","[141, 142]"
"Thisisthat —withtheexceptionof certainconstructionspresentedin§§3.19and3.20 ~ modifiers always correspond to the PREDICATE of the constituent sentence, while heads always
correspond to the TOPIC of the constituent sentence. In other words, the relation modifier-head in the
resultant sentence corresponds to the relation predicate-topic in the constituent sentence. To illustrate:
Matrix sentence:Nobela ang libro.
‘The book is a novel.’Constituent sentence:Nasa mesa ang libro.
‘The book is on the table.’Resultant sentence:Nobela ang librong nasa mesa.
‘The book on the table is a novel.’The modification construction in the resultant sentence is librong nasa mesa. It includes the modifier nasa
mesa and the head libro. (The -ng after libro will be discussed below.) Note that in the constituent sentencenasa mesa is the predicate while libro is in topic position. This same proportion — modifier is to head (in
the resultant sentence) as predicate is to topic (in the constituent sentence) — obtains in almost all Tagalogmodification constructions.
In English the relation predicate-subject is frequently reflected in the relation modificr-head. But this
relationship in English is less consistent than the Tagalog proportion just presented. Thus the head ‘book’ in
the modification construction ‘book | read’ corresponds to the object of the constituent sentence — ‘I read118CHAPTER 3the book’ — rather than the subject, while the modifier ‘I read’ corresponds to the subject and a part of the
predicate. In the Tagalog modification construction librong binasa ko ‘book I read’, on the other hand, the
head libro and the modifier binaso ko correspond, as is usually the case, to the topic and predicate
respectively of the constituent sentence: Binasa ko ang libro ‘tread the book’.
There is a second respect in which — again with certain exceptions discussed in § §3.19 and 3.20 — all
Tagalog modification constructions are alike. This is in their use of the device of LINKING. (As was notedin §3.8, linking is the connecting of two sentence elements by means of a third, called a LINKER, which
has as its sole function the indication of a relation between the two elements it connects.) The clements ofTagalog modification constructions are in the great majority of cases connected by the linker na/-ng, one of
the two major linkers of Tagalog. (The characteristics of the other major linker, the linker -ng, are presented
in §3.8.)
The linker na/-ng has two different forms. The form that occurs in any given case is determined by
the final consonant of the independent form of the element that precedes the linker. If this final consonant
is /h/, {’'/, or /n/, the consonant is replaced by /n/, which is represented in conventional writing by -ng at the
end of a word. For example:
mabuti /mabu:tih/ ‘good’+ linker na/-ng + mabuting /mabu:tin/
mayumi /mayu:mi / ‘modest’ + linker na/-ng - mayuming /mayu:min/mayaman /maya:man/ ‘rich’+ linker na/-ng - mayamang /maya:man/
as inmabuting
mayumingtao‘amayamanggood
modestperson’richIf the final consonant is not /h/, /*/, or /n/, it is not replaced. Instead, it is followed by /na/, which is
represented in conventional spelling as a separate word, na. Thus:
masipag /masi:pag/ ‘diligent’ + linker na/-ng — masipag na /masi:pag na/
magalang /maga:lan/ ‘courteous’ + linker na/-ng -> magalang na /maga:lan na/matakaw /mata:kaw/ ‘greedy’ + linker na/-mg > matakaw na /mata:kaw na/
as in
Masipag
magalang
matakawdiligent
na tao‘acourteous
greedyperson’(The /na/ form of the linker na/-ng also occurs after a pausc, whatever may be the final consonant of the
word that precedes the pause — cf. §3.18.) (Some speakers occasionally, and others regularly, omit the /na/
form of the linker ma/-ng immediately after one of the enclitic particles daw, la(majng, and tuloy — cf.
§ §6.4 and 6.5. Thus the following sentence is acceptable with or without na:Masipag daw (na) tao ang kailangan nila.
‘They say that what they necd is a diligent person."")
English has no device used in modification constructions that corresponds very closely to the Tagaloglinker na-/-ng. The most important grammatical device for expressing modification in English is word
order: one-word modifiers usually precede, and phrasal modifiers usually follow, the head: ‘new book’
versus ‘book on the table’. In Tagalog modification constructions, on the other hand, word order is
relatively free. Thus ‘new book’ may be either bagong libro or librong bago, and ‘book on the table’ cither
nasa mesang libro or librong nasa mesa. Certain Tagalog modification constructions, however, do showword-order restrictions or word-order preferences. These restrictions and preferences are dealt with in the
appropriate sections on the following page.","[127, 128]"
"Modification constructions headed by personal pronouns are considerably more restricted, both in
their internal structure and in the contexts in which they occur, than are modification constructions headed
by nouns. The order of elements within a modification construction headed by a personal pronoun is
always head (pronoun) + linker + modifier. Thus:mga sundalosoldiers’tatlothree’mga pagod
kamingtired ones’
“wemahihirappoor ones’nasa hukboin the army’pinili niyawhom he chose’but not: *nga sundalong kami, etc.
In the case of singular pronouns, only the ang forms (cf. §3.3) may occur as heads of modification
constructions, and then only in predicate position. Thus:Ikaw na Pilipino ang kailangan ng heneral.
‘What the general needs is you, a Filipino.’
but not:
*Kailangan kang Pilipino ng heneral.
These restrictions do not apply to plural pronouns. Ang, ng, and sa plural pronouns may all head
modification constructions, and such modification constructions may occur in all the same contexts as theunmodified pronouns. Thus:
Kailangan kayong mga Pilipino ng heneral.
‘The general need you Filipinos.’
Mahal ninyong mga Pilipino ang bayan ninyo.
‘Your country is dear to you Filipinos.’
Para sa inyong mga Pilipino ang paanyayang ito.
‘This invitation is for your Filipinos.’
For some speakers, any noun or pluralizable one-word adjective modifying a plural pronoun must be
explicitly pluralized (cf. §§3.9 and 4.11). For other speakers explicit pluralization in such cases is not
obligatory, but merely preferred. There is thus a certain amount of disagreement about the acceptability of
constructions such as kayong Pilipino and kaming mahirap. All speakers prefer kayong nga Pilipino and
kaming (mga) mahihirap, and some reject the constructions with nonpluralized modifiers altogether.
Modification constructions headed by the ag ang sa third-person-plural pronouns nila and Kanila are
relatively rare except where the modifier is a cardinal number. Thus constructions like nilang/kanilang mga
Pilipino ‘(of/to) them who are Filipinos’ are uncommon, but constructions like nilang/kanilang dalawa
‘(of/to) the two of them’ are of frequent occurrence.
In many cases, sentences that may be interpreted as involving modification constructions headed by
ng Of sa pronouns are susceptible to another structural interpretation as well. Thus the sentence:
Ilan ang pipiliin naming mga opisyal?",[135]
"Inversion constructions..
An INVERSION CONSTRUCTION is a construction characterized by the shifting to sentence—initial
or clause—initial position of some sentence component that does not occur in this position in basic
sentences. Inversion constructions may involve the placement of a topic before a predicate, the placementof an adverbial before a predicate, the placement of a verb complement before a predicate verb, the
placement of a phrase introduced by ni or ni... ni before the negator wala (cf. §7.14), or one of certain
combinations of these. The inversion constructions that occur in Tagalog are dealt with below under the
following headings:(1) AYINVERSION;(2) CONTRASTIVEINVERSION; (3) EMPHATICINVERSION;(4) NON-EMPHATIC INVERSION.
(1) AY INVERSION. Of the four classes of inversion constructions, ay inversion permits the widest
range of sentence—component types to be shifted to initial position. The initial component in an
ay-inversion constructionmaybe: (a) the topic; (b) an adverbial; (c)a verb complement; (d) a phraseintroduced by i or ni... ni. The inversion—marking particle ay in most cases immediately follows the
initial topic, adverbial, etc. As is noted in §6.6, however, certain enclitic particles, if they occur in the
sentence, either obligatorily or optionally precede ay. Ay may also be immediately preceded by a pause.
This pause, which is represented in the writing system by a comma, is optional in all cases.
Ay has two forms: a full form, /‘ay/, written ay in conventional spelling, and a contracted form, /y/,
written ‘y in conventional spelling. The full form may occur in any context; the contracted form occurs as avariant of the full form if the preceding word, in its independent occurrences, ends in /”/, /hj, /n/, or /w/,
and if this word is not followed by a pause. When the contracted form is used, it replaces a final /°/, /h/, or
/n/, and either replaces or follows a final /w/. Thus, bafa /ba‘ta’/ ‘child’ plus 'y is /ba‘tay/, ama /’amah/‘father’ plus ‘y is /’amay/, pinsan /pinsan/ ‘cousin’ plus ‘y is /pinsay/, and ikaw /’ikaw/ ‘you’ plus ‘y is either
['ikay/ or /’ikawy/. The contracted form of ay is more commonly used than the full form in the case of
words that, in their independent occurrences, end in /*/ or /h/. In the case of words that end in /n/ in their
independent occurrences, the contracted and full forms of ay are equally common if the word is of nativeTagalog origin: thus, either pinsan ay or pinsa'y. If the word is a loan—word from English or Spanish,
however, the full form is in most cases preferred:thus, Helen ay’, rather than Hele'y, and Juan ay, ratherthan Jua’y. In the case of words that end in /w/ in their independent occurrences, the contracted and full
forms are equally common in all cases. Whether or not the /w/ is retained in pronunciation, it is always
retained in conventional writing: thus ikaw 'y (never *ika'y).",[597]
"Hindi ka pumupunta saanman.
(Thetwo—wordwriting is preferred in the case of expressions with gaano, magkano, and paano, theone—word writing in other cases.)
In the case of interrogative words written with a word—final o, this o is retained if man is written as aseparate word, but changed to w if it is not. Thus:
anoano + manman>
anuman
sino mansino + man>
sinumanThe constructions in which indefinite expressions occur are discussed below under the following
headings:(1)INDEFINITENOMINALPHRASES;(2)INDEFINITEADVERBIALPHRASES;(3) INDEFINITE NOMINAL CLAUSES;
(4) INDEFINITE ADVERBIAL CLAUSES.
(1) INDEFINITE NOMINAL PHRASES. An indefinite nominal phrase is a phrase that consists of or
includes an indefinite expression, and that occurs in a sentence position and function typical of a nominal.
Indefinite nominal phrases thus occur as sentence topics, verb complements, possessive modifiers, etc. Thetopic marker ang is optionally deletable before an indefinite—nominal—phrase topic that includes kahit,
when the topic occurs in normal non-inverted position:
alin(man).",[644]
"The preferred ordering of nouns within a simple modification construction is: head-linker-modifier.
That is, the first noun of the construction generally corresponds to the noun in topic position in the
constituent sentence, the second to the noun in predicate position. In most cases, therefore, the first noun
represents older information or a more general semantic category, while the second noun represents newer,
more explicit, or contrastive information. Thus, to convey in a modification construction the relation
expressed in the sentence Kalan ang laruan ‘The toy is a stove’, the order laruan-linker-kalan (laruang kalan
‘toy stove’) is preferred. Only when there is a wish to contrast ‘toy stove’ with, for example, ‘real stove’, is
the order kalan-linker-laruan (Kalang laruan ‘toy stove’ or ‘stove that’s a toy’) preferred; and here the
underlying sentence would be Lanuan ang Kalan ‘The stove is a toy’.
The modifying and/or contrastive function of the second noun in a modification construction is also
evident when one of the nouns is a deictic. In a sentence like Mahal ang danit na ito ‘This dress isexpensive’, the deictic ito is a modifier that makes the referent of the noun damir explicit. Expressed in
terms of matrix, constituent, and resultant sentences, the relationships within Mahal ang damit na ito are as
follows:Matrix sentence:Mahal ang damit.
‘The dress is expensive.""
—_——Constituent sentence:Ito ang damit.
‘This is the dress.”",[130]
"(There are however, certain pluralmodification constructions
— cf. §3.16 —in which personal nouns arepreceded by non-personal markers.)There are two small groups of unmarked nouns that may optionally be used as personal nouns. The
first of these is a group of nouns that designate relatives older, or of an older generation, than the
speaker — e.g., ate ‘eldest sister’, Aya ‘eldest brother’, ina/nanay ‘mother’, ama/tatay ‘father’, tiya ‘aunt’,tiyo ‘uncle’, lola ‘grandmother’, /olo ‘grandfather’. There is some similarity between the Tagalog practice of
using nouns that designate relatives as personal nouns and the English practice of using such nouns as
proper nouns: e.g., ‘Mother’, ‘Father’, etc. But while in English there is a consistent difference in meaning
between the common and the proper noun (c.g., ‘Mother’ is usually one’s own parent, ‘the mother’ neveris), in Tagalog the referent of the noun may be exactly the same when it is used as an unmarked noun as
when it is used as a persona! noun. Thus ang nanay and si Nanay may both mean ‘Mother’, and refer to
one’s own parent. (Ang nanay may, however, also mean ‘the mother’, a meaning that si Nanay does nothave.)
The second group of unmarked nouns that may be used as personal nouns is a small group of nounsdesignating occupations —e.g., abogado‘lawyer’, alkalde ‘mayor’, Kapitan‘captain’, doktor ‘doctor’,presidente ‘president’, propesur ‘professor’, sarhento ‘sergeant’. These unmarked nouns frequently occur astitles followed by family names, in which case the title and the name function as a unitary personal
noun — e.g., si Abogadv Cruz, ‘Lawyer Cruz’, si Kapitan Santos ‘Captain Santos’. The use of the title alone
as a personal noun, which derives from deletion of the name after the title, has no close parallels in spokenEnglish (although one may occasionally hear a nurse say, ‘Doctor will see you now’). Written English
however, uses a capitalized title (following ‘the’) in some of the same contexts as those in which Tagalog
personalizes the title. Some examples of the use as personal nouns of nouns that designate relatives andprofessions are:ni Tatay
Binigyan7Lolo si otng regalong parang tatay
‘Father gave Grandmother a present for Grandfather.’sa Lolo ang Lola.ni Kapitan kay Alkalde si Propesor.",[104]
"There is a group of adjectives which, in simple modification constructions headed by an unmarked
noun, regularly precede the linker. These adjectives include the CARDINAL and ORDINAL NUMBERS (cf.
§4.4) and a small list of other words, called LIMITERS (cf. §3.22), that express quantity or order in aseries: ¢.g., marami ‘much, many’, huli ‘(the) last’. Thus, corresponding to the sentences:
Dalawa
Marami
ang bata.
Ikalawa
Huli
‘There are two children.’ (Literally: ‘The children are two.”)
‘There are many children.’ (Literally: ‘The children are many.’)‘The child is second.”
‘The child is last.”
are the following modification constructions:dalawang
maraming“two children’
‘many children’
bataikalawang“the second child’huling‘the last child’(In modification constructions consisting of a deictic and a number or limiter, word order is determined by
whichof the two elements is the head, as in the case of the deictic-plus-unmarked-noun modificationconstructions discussed in §3.12. Thus ifong dalawa is ‘these fwo’, with head ito and modifier dalawa,
while (ang) dalawang ito is ‘these two’, with the nominalized head dalawa and the modifier ito.)
Word order is much less fixed in simple modification constructions that involve modifying adjectives
other than numbers or limiters. In the case of such constructions, decided word-order preferences obtain
only when the construction occurs as an unmarked predicate. In this position, if the adjective and the noun
provide equally new or equally important information, the order noun-linker-adjective is preferred: e.g.,Doktor na bantog ang ama ni Juan.
‘Juan's father is a famous doctor.’
The order doktor na bantog ‘famous doctor’ suggests that the audience knows neither that Juan’s father is a
doctor nor that he is a famous one.",[131]
"Within the second subclass, there is a small group of unaffixed adjectives that are
GENDER-MARKED. These adjectives, all of which are borrowed from Spanish, occur in two different
forms:one endingin -o /oh/, the other ending in -a /ah/. The forms ending in -a are used when theadjectives refer to female human beings or female animals; the forms ending in -o are used in all other
cases: i.e., when the adjectives refer to male human beings or male animals, to groups including individuals
of both sexes, to inanimate objects, to abstractions, etc. Thus:Komika si Linda.",[207]
"Wala kaming pupuntahan.
have nowhere‘Weto go.”
don’t have anywhereThe wala possessive and existential constructions may be intensified to express meanings like ‘doesn’t
have any ...at all,” ‘there isn’t any...at all,” provided that the word following the linker -ng is anunmarked noun. In the intensified construction, the linker is followed by the prefix ka- /ka/, which is in
turn followed by a duplicating prefix, then by the (underlying) noun. In the case of monosyllabic
underlying nouns, the duplicating prefix is identical with the noun (except that a final /’/ or /h/ in the noun
does not appear in the prefix). In the case of longer underlying nouns, the formation of the duplicating
prefix follows the rules given for dup,- in §5.16. Some examples of intensified wala constructions are:
Wala akong katsok-tsok. /kat8o°ktSo°k/
‘I don’t have any chalk at all.""
Wala akong katsa-tsa. /kat$a‘t%a-h/
‘I don’t have any tea at all.”",[634]
