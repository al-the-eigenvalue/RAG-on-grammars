The Yukulta Case SystemThroughout this grammar I use a different analysis of the Yukulta case
system to that in Keen (1972, 1983). The two analyses are compared in
Table B-l; the GENitive raises extra problems that are irrelevant here, and
is omitted.

(Derivational)My reanalysis has been motivated by several criteria that, though
traditionally employed in descriptions of Indo-European case systems
(e.g. Latin, Russian) have only recently become accepted by
Australianists since the important papers by Mel'cuk (1979) and Goddard
(1982). To quote Goddard's formulation (p. 169), ""a case is a class ofThe Yukulta Case System559nominal forms which are mutually substitutable in certain syntactic or
semantic environments given that for any two cases, casej and casej are
formally distinguished by at least one subclass of nominal"" (italics mine).
On my analysis all nominals in apposition and all nominals that are
mutually substitutable, have the same case. In (10-53), for example, the
phrase ngalawanji burldamurri ('we three (OBJect)') is glossed as
containing two words, each in the LOCative; Keen glosses the pronoun
'OBJective' and the nominal 'ERGative/LOCative'. Similarly, the phrase
kirrwa kunawunantha 'for you two children' is parsed by my analysis
into two dative words; Keen's analysis glosses the nominal 'DATive' and
the pronoun 'BENefactive'.
A second difference is that I treat the PROPrietive (Keen's COMitative)
as a case rather than a derivational suffix. This is a possibility Keen
considers but does not adopt. There are two reasons for this: it may mark
objects in detransitivized case frames, and it marks the subcategorized
arguments of certain verbs (as in K). Both features are more
characteristic of cases than derivational suffixes. Also relevant here are
the arguments given in 3.4.2 against considering as derivational those
suffixes that include an adnominal function, simply because they may be
followed by a further suffix.
Finally, note that Yukulta nominals have a truly ergative/absolutive,
rather than a ""tripartite"" system (with distinct A, S and Ο cases), since no
nominal subclass formally distinguishes S from O.1
This is the appropriate point to mention another deviation between my
glosses and Keen's: in the interests of presenting the complex Yukulta
facts, I use slightly more transparent labels than in her grammar for the
tense/mood categories of the auxiliary. For example, in (10-53) I gloss
the auxiliary as 'PST.IRR' rather than her 'FUT' ; this is justified by her
own analysis (Keen 1983: 223).","[584, 585, 586]"
"3.1 Parts of speech and phrasal categories
From Dionysius Thrax onwards it has been normal grammatical practice
to define parts of speech through a combination of morphological,
syntactic and semantic criteria. This works well enough when all three
criteria coincide, but is more problematic in languages where, for
example, a given word may be a ""syntactic noun""— defined perhaps by
its ability to govern case agreement and follow a determiner—but a
""morphological verb""—defined by the fact that it inflects for
morphological categories such as tense, mood, and polarity.
Kayardild is such a language. Although morphological and syntactic
criteria, taken alone, yield clearcut results, there are cases when they do
not give the same category. In other words, the grammar sanctions
various types of mismatch between morphological, syntactic and
semantic criteria. In this section I proceed by first defining a set of word
classes on predominantly morphological criteria; then looking briefly at
the two phrasal projections of these classes found in Kayardild, namely
NP and VC; and finally considering the various types of categorial
mismatch that are possible.
3 . 1 . 1 Word classes
For Kayardild five major word classes may be set up, based on the
suffixing possibilities of each word. These are mutually exclusive; each
root belongs to just one class. A number of derivational processes change
word class; those deriving nominals from verbals are discussed in 11.2
and 11.3, and those deriving verbals from nominals in 7.5. The word
classes are:3.1 Parts of speech and phrasal categories
1. Nominals85(a) noun/adjective
(b) pronoun
(c) locational - demonstrative
- compass locational
- positional
(d) manner nominal
(e) predicate nominal
(f) time nominal2. Veibals
3. Particles
4. Inteijections
5. ConjunctionsThe noun/adjective subclass and the verbal class are essentially the only
open classes, although a few English loans are passing into the particle
and interjection classes (9.7.3).
The nominal and verbal classes are the most important and populous.
In general nominals denote entities or attributes, and verbals denote
actions. States like ""know"", ""be ignorant"" and ""be jealous"" are expressed
by predicate nominals in Kayardild. The two major classes have distinct
inflectional possibilities. A nominal word is obligatorily inflected for
case; a verbal word must take one of a rich set of tense / mood / polarity
markers. Nominal and verbal words also have distinct sets of derivational
suffixes.
3 . 1 . 1 . 1 The nominal class. Several subclasses must be
distinguished within the nominal class.
As in many Australian languages, there is a large open class of
NOUN/ADJECTIVES, with identical inflectional and derivational
possibilities. Typically, members of this class have several functional
possibilities within the NP: wurkara, for example, may designate an
entity, 'boy', or may be an adjective-like qualifier, 'male'. Jambarnda
may mean 'hollow' (attribute) or 'hollow log' (entity). Warngiida may
function as a quantifier, meaning 'one', as a qualifier, meaning
'common, shared', or as a determiner, meaning 'a, a certain'. The
various possibilities for noun/adjectives are discussed in 6.3.
Noun/adjectives may also function as nominal predicates in verbless
clauses (9.1) and as ""second predicates"" (9.4), as in 'you will return
home a good fisherman'.
PRONOUNS form a closed class. They distinguish person (1st, 2nd,
1st + 2nd or 1st inclusive, and 3rd) and number (singular, dual and
plural). The pronominal case system is basically identical to that of other
nominals; minor differences are discussed in 5.2.2.
LOCATIONALS are another closed class. They are inherently locative
and do not normally inflect for the LOCative case. A number of special
derivational suffixes are found only with this class. Locationals may be863 Some descriptivepreliminariesfurther subclassified into the DISTANCE LOCATIONALS dan-da 'this,
here' and dathina 'that, there', the COMPASS LOCATIONALS, and
POSmONALS like marrwaa 'near' and dulkalarri 'outside'.
All locationals may function as local adjuncts. In addition,
demonstrative and compass locationals may function as spatial
determiners, as in danda dangkaa 'this man' and bada dangkaa '(the)
west man'. The demonstrative dathina 'that' doubles as a discourse
determiner. And compass locationals and positionals occur in complex
NPs giving the relative location of two entities.
MANNER NOMINALS describe the manner in which an actor
accomplishes some action, e.g. kantharrkuru
'alone, unaided',
junkuyarrada 'in return, in revenge'. Whereas normal noun/adjectives
may function as heads, modifiers, nominal predicates or second
predicates, manner nominals may only function as second predicates on
semantic actors. This limits their case possibilities to the nominative, or,
with verbs taking object complements (e.g. Ί saw / found / left him
sitting alone'), to a case appropriate to objects.
PREDICATE NOMINALS have nominal form and nominal derivational
possibilities, but can only function as predicators: they cannot be used
attributively, or inflect for case. Typical examples are mibulka 'asleep'
and mungurru 'knowing, knowledgeable'. Some, such as mungurru,
may take quasi direct objects 'knowing OBJ'; and some take quasi indirect
objects, e.g. mulurra 'jealous, suspicious (of IOBJ)'.
ΉΜΕ NOMINALS give temporal specification. They too take only a
subset of nominal case inflections: see 5.4.2.
INTERROGATIVES belong to a functional class cross-cutting the
morphological
classification given above: there are interrogative
pronouns, locationals and verbs. Interrogatives are discussed with the
syntax of questions, in 9.5.
3 . 1 . 1 . 2 The verbal class. Verbals primarily denote actions and
processes, but may also provide adverbial type information about the
manner in which these are carried out. Thus the verbal lexeme kurulutha
'kill' may describe the action of ""killing"", but may also combine with
another verb, adding the meaning ""do intensely"", e.g. kurulutha marrija
[kill listen] 'listen intently'. A natural way of describing this is to
postulate a ""verbal complex"" (VC), comprising one or more verbal
lexemes, much as a ""noun phrase"" comprises one or more nominal
constituents. A given lexeme may then function as a head (as with the
""kill"" meaning) or a modifier (as with the ""do intensely"" meaning) within
this verb complex (8.2.1). A few verbal lexemes only permit the modifier
function: thus bakiija 'all S do; do to all O' can only function as a
modifier within the VC, never as a head.","[111, 112, 113]"
"3.1 Parts of speech and phrasal categories873 . 1 . 1 . 3 Particles. Kayardild has a handful of particles. These are
uninflected and express, inter alia, counterfactuality, frustrated
expectation, non-existence, and quantification; a full list is in 9.7. They
may have phrasal or sentential scope.
3.1.1.4 Interjections. These are likewise devoid of inflections, but
unlike particles typically constitute a complete utterance.
The nominal, warirra 'nothing', may also serve as an interjection
meaning 'no' or 'I've got nothing'; when functioning as a nominal it
inflects for case, but not when functioning as an interjection. This is the
only word that may belong to more than one word class.
3 . 1 . 1 . 5 Conjunctions. There are two of these: bana 'and', which
conjoins phrases and sometimes clauses, and birra 'too', limited to noun
phrases. Like particles and interjections they are uninflected, but are
distinguished from them by their inability to appear as free forms: they
must always precede or follow other words in an utterance. Unlike all
other parts of speech except clitics, their position is fixed, being limited
to immediately before or after the conjoined elements.
3 . 1 . 2 Lexical and phrasal classes; category mismatches
For each of the two major word classes, nominals and verbals, it is
useful to set up corresponding phrasal units:
NOUN PHRASES (NPs) consist of one or more nominal words,
agreeing in case (3.4.2.1), whose order is largely determined by
syntactic function (6.2.1); they are discussed in Chapter 6 1 .
VERB COMPLEXES ( V C s ) comprise one or more verbal words,
agreeing in ""final inflection"", whose order is determined by function
(8.2); they are discussed in Chapter 82.
The syntactic behaviour of elements within NPs and VCs can be used
to define categories of ""syntactic nouns"" and ""syntactic verbs""
independently of their morphological characteristics. Syntactic nouns
govern relational and/or adnominal case agreement, and may be modified
by demonstratives, adjectives, quantifiers, adnominal NPs. Syntactic
1Note that case agreement is a necessary but not sufficient condition for shared
membership of a NP: second predicates may agree in case with another NP but do not
form a constituent with it.
2
Although the term ""verb phrase"" would reflect better the isomorphic relation
between nouns and noun phrases, on the one hand, and verbs and verb complexes, on
the other, it has been used so often with the meaning of ""predicate"" or ""verb plus nonsubject arguments"" that this would be confusing. I therefore use Dixon's (1977) term
""verb complex"". In the X-bar theory of phrase structure, it corresponds to a V'.","[113, 114]"
"In general, then, Kayardild grammar displays ""unbounded concord""
whereby all cases percolate downwards, not just to immediate
constituents, but on to their subconsituents, until the unit ""word"" is
reached. The multiple case suffixes that result are ordered iconically,
except in the case of nominalized subordinate clauses where the
Associating OBLique is extrinsically ordered outside the inherited
modal case.
3 . 4 . 8 Multiple function or homophony?
A central theoretical question is whether these really should be treated as
different functions of the same suffix (as assumed this far), or as distinct
suffixes that happen to be homophonous? Related to this is the question
of whether their distribution across constituents and their positioning
within words should be taken as primary defining characteristics, or as
regular consequences of their function, combined with rules of semantic
and syntactic scope.
First let me defend the extension of the term ""case"" to all the
functional domains defined above. The rigorous definition of ""case"" in
Mel'cuk (1986) takes two characteristics as criterial for calling an
inflectional category ""case"": first, it displays agreement, and secondly, it
is used to distinguish types of syntactic dependency.
Now all functional domains of Kayardild case display agreement par
excellence. As for the second part of the definition, with each domain the
signalling of some sort of syntactic dependency is an important part of its
function. The use of relational case choices to signal subject and indirect
object (though not object) is quite clear, as is the use of adnominal case
choices to signal the possessive relation and others. Modal case, apart
from its primary use to signal mood, tense, and polarity, marks the object1183 Descriptive preliminariesrelation as well as linking some kinds of secondary predicates to their
objects. Associating case is the main marker of objecthood in the main
clause, continuative use of nominalizations. And complementizing case,
though its main function is to signal interclausal relations, distinguishes
objects and instruments (by its absence) in particular types of
topicalizations (12.5.2.1). A l l f i v e functions of case in Kayardild thus
fall within the scope of Mel'cuk's definition.
I now turn to the question of whether w e are dealing with
homophonous forms, or polysemous forms whose meanings are to be
regarded as contextual variants in different syntactic environments. A
number of factors are important here:
(A) FORM. Suffixes have the same form and range of allomorphy
regardless of their function, except for variations resulting from exposed
vs internal position, which are clearly derivative. (The only exception is
with pronouns taking the complementizing OBLique—5.2.2.) It would
clearly be inefficient to multiply statements of form by setting up five
orders of homophonous suffixes.
(B) MEANING. The transparency of the semantic relation between ""modal""
and ""relational"" or ""adnominal"" meanings varies with the case
considered. The relationship between ablative and ""past"", and allative and
""inceptive"", is one of straightforward transfer from the spatial to the
temporal or aspectual planes. But the relationship between proprietive or
""having"" and potential modality requires more subtle analysis of the
relational and adnominal meanings of the Kayardild proprietive, which
include ""intentional object"" and ""potential ability"" (4.3.5). In the case of
the OBLique, whose modal value is ""emotive"", it has virtually been
leached of a clear semantic value in its relational use. I consider the nature
of these semantic relationships in more detail in 10.2.
This range, from semantically transparent polysemy to functional
ranges with a less clear semantic basis, is typical of case systems in many
languages—just consider the genitive with objects of negated verbs in
Polish or Russian, and the effects of discourse factors on case-marking
(Hopper—Thompson 1980) in a large number of languages. Cases that
include information about tense are found in other Australian languages
(e.g. Kalkatungu, Pitta-Pitta and of course Yukulta and Lardil) and also
in the Caucasus (e.g. Georgian—see Vogt 1971 and Harris 1981).
Although some semantic link may be uncovered by careful analysis (e.g.
Wierzbicka's (1980) study of the Russian instrumental), the case systems
of most languages abound in such problematic polysemy.
The radical difference between Kayardild and these other languages is
that in Kayardild each semantic or syntactic component is factored out, as
it were, and represented in a separate level of case-marking, whereas in
most languages a number of factors combine to select a single case (see3.4 Functional domains of case inflection119Austin 1981b for some Australian examples). To consider a single
example: in many languages, objects of nominalized verbs receive an
oblique case instead of the regular object case (cf. Silverstein 1981). That
is, two syntactic factors—object relation, and nominalized verb—
combine to select a single case (usually the dative or genitive). In
Kayardild, on the other hand, each is represented by a distinct case
inflection: the object relation by the appropriate modal case, and the fact
that the verb is nominalized by the associating OBLique.
(C) SEQUENCE RESTRICTIONS. Certain sequences of case-suffixes are not
permitted in Κ (4.2.3): the OBLique may not be followed by another case,
and the LOCative may only be ""followed"" by the OBLique, in which case
the suppletive portmanteau -(k)urrka is used. A number of strategies may
be used when such restrictions are encountered. For example, the inner
suffix may be replaced by a near synonym that does not violate the
restriction, or it may disappear entirely. What is relevant here is that these
sequence constraints apply regardless of suffix function (although the
choice of a synonymous substitute does depend on their function, as one
would expect). Our morphological statements are therefore simplified if
we assume that the same suffix is involved.
In this grammar I adopt a polysemy analysis, treating the various case
functions as functional or contextual variants of single cases. This has the
advantage of emphasising the strikingly case-like syntactic properties (in
particular, concord) found with all functions of these suffixes, of
drawing attention to the semantic connections between case and modality,
of accounting for the identical sequence restrictions that these suffixes
obey regardless of their function, and of being faithful to their historical
origins: as I will show in 10.4 and 12.6, all these morphemes originated
as case suffixes sensu strictu, regardless of their synchronic status.
At the same time, I will make the determining role of syntactic context
explicit by treating case suffixes as bipartite entities, identified by a case
label (e.g. ABLative) and a function (e.g. Modal). This makes it possible
to formulate generalizations either in terms of function, or in terms
of ""case"".
3 . 4 . 9 Case, concord and constituency
In K, case concord is a valuable tool for diagnosing constituent structure.
We have already seen how the domain of adnominal and relational cases
clearly reflects the constituency of embedded NPs in a phrase like:

this-GEN-INSTRmaku-karra-nguni]^·^

"54612 Finite subordinate clauseswhen the antecedent is a LOCative underlying object, or where no
antecedent exists at all.17
1 2 . 6 . 2 Evolution of the Kayardild Odd Pivot system
It is likely that pT—or at least proto southern Tangkic—had a system
essentially identical to the Yukulta one just described. At some later
stage, the case marking strategy for main clauses shifted from an ergative
to an accusative system (10.4.2.2) with objects coming to take the
LOCative in the commonest construction type. As the pT form {-kiya}
lost its ergative function, the affiliations of the old complementizing
ergative would no longer have been clear, and it was almost completely
reanalysed as a LOCative, with which it was formally identical. The only
residue of its original ergative status is the ban on C.LOC appearing on
pronouns: this goes back to the fact that the ergative form of protoTangkic pronouns was identical with the absolutive (later nominative), so
that the synchronically aberrant invarient subject pronouns merely
continue the old ergative form (cf. 12.1.4.1).
If the rules for assigning complementizing case remained
unchanged—and this is quite plausible, given the relative conservatism of
subordinate clause constructions (cf. Givon 1979: 89)—we would obtain
the schema illustrated in Table 12-1 (OBV represents the case where the
subordinate subject has no antecedent).
Almost the entire complementizing system in stage 1 follows from the
single principle of case agreement—the ""obviative dative"" and the use of
the complementizing dative where the antecedent is an object remarked
with the LOCative are two minor supplementary principles. By contrast,
that at stage 2 lacks any obvious rationale, and would have to be learnt as
a collection of unmotivated rules. Clearly the pressure to somehow
refashion it would be great. One simple way would be to reinstate a
modified agreement rule: if the antecedent is nominative (A or S), don't
mark the subordinate clause, otherwise mark it. Assuming further that
speakers were aware of two alternate markers (*LOC and *DAT) but were
unsure how to use them, we may postulate a stage in which all
subordinate clauses with non-subject antecedents could take either. At
this stage we essentially have a switch reference system, which marks17It is not uncommon for systems of antecedent-agreement to employ as
complementizers only a subset of the available (relational) case inflections, resulting
in exceptions to the agreement principle. In Martuthunira (Dench 1988) ""Finite
Relative Clauses"" can be complementized with the Accusative or the Locative, marked
on the verb. While the Accusative is used only with accusative antecedents, the
Locative covers Genitive as well as Locative antecedents.","[572, 573]"

—Figure 5-1. Pronoun stems
The three stem variants for the pronoun series are shown in Figure
5-1. The number 1 indicates first person exclusive, and 12 first person
inclusive (i.e. including speaker and hearer). Bracketed epenthetic
vowels are optional, except that where the pronoun is breath-group final
the epenthetic vowel of the 1st dual Subject OBLique is obligatory,
supporting the final w left by prosodic truncation: ngarraw.
Apart from slight changes in the distribution of epenthetic vowels,
these are identical to the Yukulta forms and, we may assume, to the proto
Tangkic forms, except that the first non-singular exclusive root is likely5.2 Pronouns203to have been nya-, as in Lardil, and to have been analogically reshaped
to nga- in the South Wellesley languages.
Yangkaal pronouns are also virtually identical, except that the 1st and
2nd nominative singular have the extra forms nganha (besides ngada) and
nyiwa (besides nyingka). The use of these forms is unclear. They may
have been emphatic forms deriving from incorporation of an erstwhile
emphatic clitic *-ma into the singular stems: lsg nganha (Yangkaal) <
nganh-ma (Yukulta + Stative clitic) < lsg ngaTH- plus emphatic -ma, 2sg
nyiwa (< 2sg nyi(ng)- plus emphatic ma, with irregular lenition of the
nasal). Lardil pronouns have undergone a number of phonological
changes, and have innovated a ""harmonic"" vs ""disharmonic"" distinction
in non-singular pronouns (see Hale 1966).
5 . 2 . 1 . 1 Analysis of stems. Temporarily leaving aside the nonsingular forms, the nominative and possessive pronoun forms can be
neatly segmented as follows:
PersonInclusionNumberPossessive stem1nga--ku-Dual -rrPlural -/--wan- (~-umban-)2kibi-3The possessive pronoun formative -wan-, with irregular -(u)mban- in the
second singular ngumban-, is clearly cognate with the ORIGin case, with
its parallel irregular alternation between -wan- with noun/adjectives and
-umban- with compass locationals (the source of lsg -(i)jin- is a
mystery). It is likely that in pT -mban-/-wan- was the possessive case
form, and that semantic specialization has in the modem languages split
this into a possessive pronoun formative with pronominals, and a distinct
ORIGin case elsewhere; certainly in Κ they can no longer be treated as one
suffix.
Most ""subject oblique"" forms add -waa (after consonants or
monosyllables) or -wa (after vowel-final disyllables) to the possessive
pronoun stem, minus the -wan- formative. Alternatively, they can be
derived by deleting η from the possessive stem). Epenthetic vowels that
are optional in the possessive pronoun forms are obligatory in the subject

of clauses complementized with the dative case (12.6.1). This would
have given rise to the Kayardild ""subject oblique"" use, which is the only
place these forms still appear in modern K.
For other OBLique functions the pT dative has been replaced in
modem Κ by the OBLique suffixed to the possessive pronoun stem, as in:

lsgPOSS-MOBL5 . 2 . 2 Special characteristics of pronominal case
In most respects, case use with pronominals is indistinguishable from
that with other nominals. Two differences are discussed in this section:
the use of possessive pronouns to show possession of all types, and the
formal identity (outside the NOMinative) of possessives and ordinary
pronouns. Two other important differences are discussed elsewhere: the
optional use of the LOCative case with pronominal objects of imperatives
(3.4.3), and the unusual case forms of pronominal subjects in
complementized clauses (12.1.1).
5 . 2 . 2 . 1 Possessive pronouns. These are used for all types of
possession. The three-way distinction maintained with noun/adjectives
between the ablative (possession through inheritance or manufacture), the
apposed noun construction (inalienable possession) and the genitive (the
unmarked case) is neutralized, with possessive pronouns being used for
all types:

3sg-POSS-NOM shelterNOM
'Mother's grass shelter (that she made)' 'Her grass shelter (that she made)'9My gloss 'DATive' here corresponds to Keen's 'benefactive'. See Appendix Β for
justification.","[229, 230, 231]"
"Goddard points out that the PURPosive case could also be used here, but
would imply ""a need or conventionally recognized purpose"", whereas the
INTENT suffix ""says that the actor has a strictly personal intention that
may or may not be a conventionally recognized goal."" Significantly, the
PURPosive does not show ergative agreement. The semantic reason for
this contrast apparently resides in the personal nature of the motivation
shown by the INTENT suffix: the motivation can only be known by
knowing something about the actor.
To summarize this section, a number of Australian languages use
""ergative agreement"" to signal a semantic link between subject and the
target argument. The actual semantic conditions range from strict
secondary predication (e.g. 10-21, 10-22) to a looser type of semantic
orientation, where the case meaning includes a semantic component
referring to the subject.
The semantic conditions calling for modal blocking in Kayardild (as
distinct from those that place the target NP outside the VP and therefore
block associating case as well) are more specific: they are limited to the
looser ""subject orientation"", rather than second predication on the
subject We will now examine these in more detail.
1 0 . 3 . 2 The semantics of subject-orientation in Kayardild
The specific semantics of this phenomenon is best brought out by
comparing constructions with basically similar participant roles, but
differing in subject orientation.
1 0 . 3 . 2 . 1 Types of instrument. Perhaps the most subtle
investigation of the semantics of the instrumental case is that given in
Wierzbicka (1980). Her explications of the Russian instrumental include
both a ""subject component"" (""SUBJ did something"") and a contact
component (""INSTR came into contact with OBJ""). Different languages
take different components as paramount, leading to different patterns of10.3 The domain of modal case marking417case syncretism. Ergative/instrumental syncretism, as in Dyirbal (Dixon
1972), stresses the subject component. Locative/instrumental syncretism,
as in Warluwarra (Breen 1971), stresses the contact component. In yet
other languages the instrument function may simply be inferred from the
presence of a second predicate of having, as with the Yukulta examples
discussed above; in ergative languages with this construction the having
suffix is followed by ergative agreement 10
Κ allows a number of possibilities.
INSTRUMENT OF EQUIPMENT. When the instrument is borrowed or
temporarily snatched up for the task at hand, the Associative is used.
This functions as a second predicate on the subject, with the reading ""X
V-ed, temporarily having ASSOC"" (implied: ""and using it""). Like all other

"42410 The modal case system10.4.1 Nature of the proto-language
Despite an early suggestion by Hale (1970) that proto-Tangkic was
morphologically accusative, it is now generally accepted that it was
morphologically ergative.
Hale had suggested that Australian languages of the majority ergative
type had evolved by generalizing a passive construction present in an
accusative proto language. As he pointed out, this hypothesis ""entails that
the so-called ergative case is simply that of the agent of a passive"" (Hale
1970:764). Changes of this type have occurred in several Polynesian
languages (Hohepa 1969, Chung 1977).
Consideration of the marking of demoted agents in modern Tangkic
passives gives no support to this. Each insular language has a different
pattern. In Lardil, demoted agents take the OBJective (< pT *DAT),
GENitive, or possessive pronoun. In Kayardild they take the ABLative,
OBLique (< pT *DAT), LOCative, or verbal allative. The limited data on
Yangkaal contains but one example, with a possessive pronoun. (Details
on these choices are in 9.3.2.2.) Such diversity suggests recent and
independent innovation, rather than continuation of an ancestral
construction.
Klokeid (1978) and McConvell (1981), working independently, and
both relying on Yukulta and Lardil data only, advanced similar arguments
for an ergative ancestry.
Firstly, Klokeid showed that the underlying (i.e. pre-truncated) form
of the Lardil 'OBJective' case is -NHTHa. This is identical to the Yukulta
dative, which can mark objects in middle constructions; Klokeid inferred
that the Lardil system arose through generalization of such a clause type,
which replaced the old ergative type.
Secondly, Lardil (like Kayardild) leaves the (non-pronominal) objects
of imperatives unmarked; this can be explained as a last residue of
ergative morphology.
Thirdly, both pointed out that the passive in Lardil arose from an
earlier reflexive construction with widespread non-Tangkic cognates.
Finally, McConvell demonstrated similarities between some Lardil
main clause types and subordinate clause types in Yukulta, and suggested
that the former were derived from the latter.
Although both Klokeid and McConvell agree that pT was ergative,
they propose different explanations of why the ergative proto system was
abandoned. I postpone discussion of this until 10.4.3.
In this section, I will take the morphologically ergative nature of the
proto-language as established. The emphasis will be on the related
question of how modal case evolved, a question which the addition of
Kayardild and Yangkaal data now allows us to answer in some detail.","[450, 451]"

GunwinyguanOther non Pama
NyunganMap 3. Main genetic groupings of Australian languages30I The language and its speakersThere are also strong typological differences between Pama-Nyungan
and non-Pama-Nyungan. In general, non-Pama-Nyungan languages are
head-marking, make use of prefixation as well as suffixation, have four
or more noun classes, have weakly developed systems of subordination,
and make only optional use of core case marking. Pama-Nyungan
languages, by contrast, are generally dependent-marking (though many
use auxiliaries hosting clitic pronouns), use suffixation only, lack noun
classes, have a tightly organized and rich system of case marking, are
generally organized ergatively for nouns, and have a rich set of
subordinate clause types, often using switch-reference, antecedent case
agreement, or syntactically-defined pivots or some combination thereof.
It is only along the eastern edge of the Pama-Nyungan / non-PamaNyungan border that these correlations break down, and where
languages are found whose classification as Pama-Nyungan or nonPama-Nyungan has been revised.
Yanyuwa, for example, was originally classified by O'Grady et al. as
a family-level isolate, but has been shown by Blake (1988) and Evans
(1988) to be Pama-Nyungan on the basis of its pronouns, case forms,
and the presence of initial laminalization; Blake has shown it should be
grouped with Warluwarra, Wakaya and some other languages in the
discontinuous Warluwarric group within Pama-Nyungan.
Typologically, however, it is in many respects a typical non-PamaNyungan language, with elaborate prefixing morphology on verbs and
noun-class prefixes to nouns, although it does possess a participializing
suffix with cognates in many Pama-Nyungan languages.
Karrwa and Wanyi together form a group that is transitional between
non-Pama-Nyungan and Pama-Nyungan in its pronoun forms, though
typologically resembling Pama-Nyungan. The languages of the Jingiluan
group, though clearly non-Pama-Nyungan, typologically resemble
Pama-Nyungan languages in having suffixing morphology, but recent
work by Blake (1990) shows this to have been a historically recent
development: verbal suffixes, for example, have developed by suffixing
an old auxiliary verb which bore prefixes.
1.4.2Position of the Tangkic languagesThe Tangkic languages lie at the eastern edge of the Pama-Nyungan /
non-Pama-Nyungan border, and their genetic affiliations have been
revised several times over the last two decades.
The balance of evidence now suggests that the Tangkic languages
have their closest genetic affiliations, as shown by comparative
phonology and morphology, with the non-Pama-Nyungan languages of
Arnhem Land. But subsequent intensive contact with Pama-Nyungan
languages of the North Central Desert region, specifically with those of1.4 The Tangkic family in Australian perspective31the Ngumpin and Ngarrka groups, has led to a typological assimilation
to the dependent-marking, Pama-Nyungan type. Typologically they have
come to resemble Pama-Nyungan languages in being dependent-marking
and entirely suffixing; proto-Tangkic was, additionally, ergative in its
case alignments, like the vast majority of Pama-Nyungan languages.
There has also been a certain amount of borrowing of vocabulary and
morphology, so that although the percentage of shared vocabulary does
not exceed 10% with any non-Tangkic group, the highest percentages
(around 6-8%) are with Pama-Nyungan languages. Fuller discussion of
lexical cognates is in Evans (in prep b).
1.4.2.1
Typological comparisons. Typologically the Tangkic
languages—especially Yukulta and what we can reconstruct of protoTangkic—have very little in common with their closest relatives in
Arnhem Land, and in fact could pass for typical Pama-Nyungan
languages. These similarities are summarized here without substantial
justification, which is given in comparative asides to the relevant
sections of the grammar.
Although the grammar of all modern Tangkic languages is extremely
unusual, the most plausible proto system was not atypical for a PamaNyungan language: suffixing, agglutinating, basically ergative, with free
word order and a rich array of case inflections. Like many PamaNyungan languages, in particular those of the Northern Nyungic area, it
may also have had an auxiliary which followed the first constituent and
carried information about tense and mood, as well as subject and object
bound pronouns. The ""modal case"" which is such a distinctive feature of
Kayardild and Lardil was not a feature of proto-Tangkic, nor was
""verbal case"" present in other than incipient form. However, the use of
case agreement on complement clauses, governed by the case of a mainclause antecedent, was more clearly present than in modern Kayardild or
Lardil; again this is characteristic of many Pama-Nyungan languages and
is particularly well-developed in the northern Nyungic area.
The main peculiarity of proto-Tangkic was a system of
detransitivized constructions triggered by certain tense, mood and
polarity conditions characteristic of ""lowered discourse transitivity""
(Hopper—Thompson 1980). In irrealis desideratives, for example,
transitive clauses had an ABSolutive:DATive case frame rather than the
usual ERGative:ABSolutive frame.
The typological resemblances between Tangkic and two PamaNyungan subgroups are also worth mentioning. The Ngayarda
subgroup (Pilbara district, W.A.), like Kayardild/Yangkaal and Lardil,
has become morphologically accusative from an ergative ancestor
(Dench 1982). This is undoubtedly a recent and completely independent
development. Closer at hand, Kalkatungu (Blake 1979b), Yalarnnga
(Blake 1971) and Pitta Pitta (Blake 1979a), spoken to the south of the321 The language and its speakersTangkic subgroup, are all basically ergative but with accusative
constructions triggered by various tense/mood conditions (see Blake
1987), a feature they share with Yukulta and proto-Tangkic19.
This raises the question of whether the common presence of tensetriggered non-ergative constructions in Tangkic, Kalkatungu and Pitta
Pitta is due to some genetic affiliation, especially since all are aberrant in
a number of ways (pronouns, lexicon and case forms) 20 . But there are
no other similarities between Tangkic and these languages (and cognacy
rates lie in the 2-3% range), which makes this hypothesis unlikely. More
probable is a previous period of contact and structural diffusion of the
relevant constructions.
1.4.2.2
Comparative phonology and morphology. Lexical
items and typological features are readily diffusable, particularly in
Australia, and to get a more reliable idea of the genetic affiliations of
Tangkic we need to turn to subgroupings established by regular sound
changes, as well as aspects of morphology that are resistant to
borrowing, such as pronouns21. The comparative data that is decisive in
grouping the Tangkic languages as non-Pama-Nyungan are the pronoun
forms, and the retention of initial apical stops and nasals that laminalize
in Pama-Nyungan. I shall also mention the significant lack of various
nominal and verbal morphemes that are extremely widespread in PamaNyungan.","[55, 56, 57, 58, 59]"
"This raises the possibility that the use of ABS:DAT case frames in protoTangkic negatives was not confined to transitive verbs, but was also
found with intransitive verbs taking a locative complement.
Unfortunately, Keen's Yukulta corpus lacks any comparable examples so
we cannot know whether similar rules existed in Yukulta.
Apart from negative constructions, we have no evidence outside
Yukulta for other semantic conditions triggering a detransitivized case
frame. All we can infer, then, is that under semantic conditions including
the negative, and possibly other conditions, the ABS:DAT construction
was used in proto-Tangkic. The lack of reflexes in Lardil of an ABS:LOC
frame suggests it probably came into use as an alternative in proto-South
Wellesley, though it may of course have existed in proto-Tangkic and
been lost in Lardil.
What is important historically is that the relevant constructions were
accusative rather than ergative: transitive and intransitive subjects were
treated alike morphologically, and objects were distinguished. This43210 The modal case systemprovided a clear model from which accusative morphology could
develop.
1 0 . 4 . 1 . 3 Complementized subordinate clauses. Subordinate
clauses are normally more conservative than main ones (cf. Givon 1979),
and the Tangkic languages are no exception. Whereas pT main clause
types (1) and (2) have either been lost or undergone a drastic change of
function in all languages but Y, every modern Tangkic language
preserves several pT subordinate clause types. Accordingly, examples
from all four languages will be used here in support of our
reconstruction.
Subordinate clauses in pT were formed by adding a
""t-complementizing"" 2 2 case suffix to the verb, following the -77/thematic, and a case-suffix to all NPs of the subordinate clause except the
subject where present. In Keen's Yukulta examples the subject is equideleted from all but PRIOR clauses; it is hard to know whether this was
obligatory.
Figure 10-5 summarizes the probable pT clause types. In negatives
the complementizer followed the negative thematic -nang- (7.2.1). To
simplify the exposition negatives, which have undergone comparable
changes, will not be discussed here.
The complementizing cases transparently signal the temporal/modal
link between clauses. DATive and PROPrietive cases, for example, may
apply to NPs marking purpose; DATive and PROPrietive complementized
clauses have a similar ""purpose"" meaning, and function like ordinary NPs
bearing the approprate case. Likewise the CONSequential signals temporal
priority whether it applies to a simple NP or a clause.
For most subordinate clause types—the various purposive clauses
(purpose, implicated and movement purpose), and simultaneous—the
case following the verb thematic and that appearing on NPs is identical.
Purpose clauses, with reflexes in Y (10-59) and the Kayardild
hortative (7.2.3.10), involved a DATive on verbs and NPs alike:
(10-59)
Y22kira warra-ja=rna,
close go-IMP=himFollowing Dench—Evans (1988) I use the term ""t-complementizing case"" for
cases that establish a temporal, spatial or logical relationship between a main and
subordinate clause; this is contrasted with the ""c-complementizing"" use of case to track
coreference relationships between arguments in main and subordinate clauses
(Mnemonically, ""t"" stands for ""temporal"", ""c"" for coreference). pT had both types, tcomplementizing and c-complementizing, with the latter outside; c-complementizing
case is discussed in 12.6.1.","[458, 459]"
"This is a relict of the old ergative construction, in which objects took the
ABSolutive. In accounting for the retention of this pattern of object
marking, it is significant that none of the triggering conditions for the
detransitivized case frame can be met in positive imperatives: the subject
must be second person, ruling out inverse subject/object combinations,
the polarity must be positive, and the imperative mood is incompatible
with irrealis or dubitative status: Yukulta uses a distinct verb inflection
for irrealis imperatives.
Although the imperative construction is conservative with respect to
object marking, the subject takes the NOMinative (pT ABSolutive), in
accordance with modern case marking rules.24
1 0 . 4 . 2 . 2 Detransitivized frames become the canonical clause
type. As we saw in 10.4.1.2, Yukulta has two ""general detransitivized
constructions"" reassigning the cases of subject and object as ABS:DAT or
ABS:LOC. It is likely that pT had only the first of these, the second being
innovated after Lardil split off. We cannot be sure of the triggering
semantic conditions.
Each of these case frames has been taken as canonical by some
modern language.
Lardil has generalized the ABS:DAT frame, so that its reflex is now the
unmarked construction: transitive verbs in the ""plain"" form take the
""OBJective case"", cognate with the pT dative (10-76, 10-77). Klokeid
(1978) uses internal reconstruction to set up {-iNHTHa}, cognate with the
pT dative, as the underlying form for the L 'OBJective' case. For present
purposes we may note that three regular morphophonemic processes in L
are responsible for the surface forms: SCHWA-DROP, giving -iNHTH,
cluster-reduction, giving -iNH, and final-delaminalization, giving -in.

that the ""apposition"" or ""unmerged"" analysis of NP structure (6.1)
provides an answer. Under this analysis, the words of an NP like 'the big
man' are not parsed as sister NPs below a common NP node, but as
apposed NPs: 'the big one, the man'. If NPs in proto-Tangkic had this
kind of structure, each word of the ""unmerged NP"" could undergo the
word-level process of derivation or compounding, e.g. [big-put man-put]
for 'put to the big one, put to the man'. Later changes in syntax, leading
to a more structured ""merged"" interpretaton of the NP, would cause such
sequences to be reinterpreted as NPs over which 'put' shows concord,
rather than apposed compounds.
4 . 4 . 4 . 2 Integration of normal and verbal case systems.
Despite their diverse origins, the verbal cases are fully integrated into the
Kayardild case system. The main functions of normal and verbal cases
are summarized in Figure 4-5.
Semantically, verbal cases are partly complementary and partly
parallel to the normal case system. Core syntactic functions are always
marked by normal case, as are ""static"" functions like the LOCative; so are
all adnominal functions (which are also static)25. What may be broadly
described as ""dynamic"" functions, involving change over time (e.g.
change of location, change of possession) tend to take verbal cases.
Some dynamic functions, like the allative, ablative and purposive, take
either, but the verbal case is gaining ground.
This may be attributed in part to the inherent suitability of verbs for
expressing ""dynamic"" relationships, and in part to a shift in the functional
load of the corresponding normal cases, increasingly used to signal
modality or other non-relational functions. It is significant that in
Yukulta, where the ""normal"" cases do not double as modality markers,
the role of verbal cases is very limited, whereas in Kayardild, Yangkaal
and Lardil, where modal cases have developed, the motion function of
normal cases is moribund (as in Kayardild) or has disappeared
completely (as in Lardil).
4 . 4 . 4 . 3 Why verbal case? This leads us to the typological question
of why verbal case should be unique to the Tangkic languages, languages
that are already peculiar in other ways. After all, it has been widely
claimed that ""semantic cases"" and prepositions are predicates (e.g.
Becker—Arms (1969), Fillmore (1971)), and verbs are the most natural
lexical category for supplying predicates. Verbs with prepositional
functions are found in many languages (see 4.4.1.3), but nowhere else,
25Although the incipient verbal case-like uses of -wirdija and -kanthalatha would, if
extended, begin to encroach on the ""static"" LOCative and PRIVative functions.","[207, 208, 209]"
"Kayardild-English DictionaryThe following Kayardild-English dictionary is a slightly revised version
of the first part of Evans (1992a), which also contains an EnglishKayardild finder list and a Kayardild ethnothesaurus, neither of which
are included here. Illustrations for the dictionary were drawn by Penny
Johnson and the late Marbuk Kohler.
Entries are arranged as follows, grouped together into lemmas .
(a) HEADWORD (in bold). The word to be defined. Verbs are given in
their 'ACTual' form, e.g. baaja 'bite, bites, bit'. Nouns are given in the
nominative form, e.g. baburrka 'splash'. Some words have variant
pronunciations, shown in brackets, e.g. kabanda (~ kabarnda)
'stargazer (fish)'. Homonyms are distinguished in headwords through
the use of numerical subscripts, e.g. biriidaj 'body'; biriida2 'father'.
(b) PART OF SPEECH (in italics), e.g. v.t. (transitive verb) for baaja,
and n. (noun) for baburrka.
(c) DIALECT (normal type, in brackets). Words from the Yangkaal
(Forsyth Island) dialect are indicated by (Ya), those found in both
Kayardild and Yangkaal by (K, Ya). Most of the Yangkaal words have
been taken from Hale (1962); some were transcribed by the author from
Ross Charles, Ronnie Charles and Cora Peters. If no dialect information
is given this means that the information pertains only to Kayardild.
Sometimes this information follows just part of an entry—for
example, (K, Ya) after the first meaning, 'tooth', of d a m a n d a
indicates that only this meaning is known for both Kayardild and
Yangkaal; the other meanings are known only for Kayardild. Usually
this reflects the fact that we know much less about Yangkaal than
Kayardild.
(d) ROOT or OBLIQUE FORMS (in bold between square brackets, e.g.
[bath-] after bada 'west', [LOC duujinji] after duujinda 'younger
brother'). This is used for nominals whose root and/or non-nominative
forms cannot be predicted from the nominative form given in the
headword. The root serves as the basis for most other declensions of the
noun. Note that such special information is not given where the root
differs from the nominative in a predictable way. Nouns ending in nda,
rnda, Ida and rlda always take off the da to get the root unless otherwiseKayardild-EnglishDictionary637indicated; those ending in ngka always take off the ka. Full details of
nominal declensions are in 4.2 of the Grammar.
(e) MEANING(S). One or more senses of these may be given, depending
on how rich the word is in polysemies (multiple meanings); each sense is
numbered. In some cases I follow a number of senses or alternative
translation equivalents with a single general sense in square brackets: an
example is the entry for kurrngu. Sometimes an English word giving
the meaning is in quotation marks, e.g. birmarutha cause trouble for
OBJ without intending to, ""spoilim""; this marks it as the usual translation
in ""Mornington English"".
As the ""place-marker"" OBJ in this definition illustrates, I sometimes
use grammatical abbreviations to show how particular words of the
English definition plug into the Kayardild: in this case, it means that
whatever word fills that place in the definition will be treated as a
grammatical object in Kayardild. Sometimes only words of a certain
meaning can be plugged in; this is shown by characterizing the type of
word that can be inserted through the use of a colon, e.g. under the entry
for dunbuwatha the definition '(Faculty: body part SSPRED) become
useless for its natural purpose' means that this meaning of can only apply
to nouns, designating body parts that represent some mental or physical
faculty (e.g. the ear for hearing and memory), and that this noun will be
treated grammatically as a secondary predicate on the subject, agreeing
with it in taking the nominative case.
(f) EXAMPLE SENTENCES. AS far as possible I have tried to include
example sentences showing how a word is used; these are followed by
English translations. Example sentences and translations are given in
smaller type.
(g) SYNONYMS, i.e. words of the same meaning, are given in brackets,
after an equals sign. This information is not represented systematically in
the Kayardild-English section and can be discovered more systematically
in the thesaurus.
(h)SUB-HEADWORDS, IDIOMS AND FIXED EXPRESSIONS f o l l o w theinformation for the headword. In some cases they contain the same range
of information (from (b)-(g) above) as normal headwords.

English translations are my own unless in inverted commas; these latter
are usually in Mornington English. Readers should note that
(a) definiteness and gender are not grammatically marked in
Kayardild, and I have translated these according to context;
(b) the unmarked 'ACTual' tense may be past or present,
according to context.
(c) Kayardild terms that are highly specific semantically, such
as pronouns, kin terms, and zoological/botanical terms have in
places received a less specific English translation.
(d) in general, I have supplied utterance translations rather than
sentence translations, meaning that they may be more
semantically specific than the source sentence itself requires.","[11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25]"

'Many people hacked and cut the porpoises, killed by mawurraji spears,
the ones of our murrukurnangk. 'Note that the functional classification proposed here crosscuts the
morphological subclasses proposed in 3.1. The determiner function, for
example, may be discharged by possessive pronouns, demonstratives
and compass locationals, genitive and ablative noun phrases expressing
possession, and certain noun/adjectives like niida 'same' and jathaa
'different'. This places the burden of characterizing the NP on functions
like determiner, qualifier, etc., rather than on formally-based phrasal
categories like Determiner Phrase, Adjectival Phrase and so on.
Variation in the order of modifiers causes changes in their function.
Possessive pronouns, for example, function as definite determiners
when they precede the number nominal, but are indefinite qualifiers
when they follow it: niwanda kiyarrngka thabuju 'his two brothers' vs
kiyarrngka niwanda thabuju 'two (of) his elder brothers'.",[263]
"A similar example is (1-21). Here the topic is established by
extralinguistic context rather than prior discourse.

mima-tharra-nth]
lsgCOBL
beget-PST-COBL
'He's my son.' (lit. Ί begot (him).')The fourth unusual feature of Kayardild is the existence of a second
series of case suffixes which behave semantically and syntactically like
ordinary case markers—in marking roles like recipient, direction of
motion, instrument and so on, in occupying the same morphological
position as regular case markers, and in showing concord over the NP—
but which convert their hosts from morphological nouns to
morphological verbs, which then agree in all verbal categories with the
main verb. I shall refer to this phenomenon as ""verbal case"".
Two examples from a series of six are the ""verbal dative"", which
marks beneficiaries and recipients, including the indirect objects of
'give' (1-22), and the ""verbal allative"", which marks destinations (1-23,
1-24).

"4.4 Verbal case167Lardil) later extended this use, making it fully productive and giving it
phrasal concord.
Nor do I wish to claim that all uses of the form {-kiiwatha} function
as case-inflections. There are a few words, such as dulk-ii-watha
[ground-LOC-INCH] 'be born', where the suffix is clearly derivational.
Here the meaning is idiosyncratic, and the scope is lexical, ruling out
phrases like *ngarrku-yi-watha dulki-i-watha [hard-LOC-INCH groundLOC-INCH] 'be born onto the hard ground' (although of course the
""regular"" inflectional meaning is possible here: 'go onto the hard
ground').
4 . 4 . 1 . 3 Are verbal cases serial verbs? Where verbal cases have
corresponding free forms functioning as verbs, e.g. -maru-tha in
(4-110), a tempting alternative analysis is to treat the verbal element as a
serial verb.
Constructions using serial verbs as prepositions, or to show case-like
relations, are found in languages as widespread as Yoruba, Igbo, Thai
and Chinese. In Chinese, for example, a number of NP arguments which
would be realized in English as prepositional phrases, and in most
Australian languages as phrases bearing oblique cases, appear as serial
verb constructions, in which the NP is object of the added verb: 'We
often go to New York"" is 'we often arrive New York go', 'S/He again
borrowed money from me' is 'S/He again follow me borrow money',
and so on (examples from Li—Thompson 1981, see also Hag£ge 1975).
Could we not analyse the Kayardild verbal cases as serial verbs in
which the argument is incorporated into the valence-adding verb?
There are four arguments against this.
Firstly, it would be unusual for the incorporation process to be
repeated for each word in the NP.
Secondly, serial verb constructions do exist in Kayardild with motion
verbs, but verbal cases have nothing in common with them syntactically.
In these serial verb constructions, discussed in 8.2.2 and 8.2.3, the order
of the two verbs is fixed; this is not so of the verbal case construction.
Thirdly and most tellingly, the nominal arguments in verbal case
constructions are not in a syntactically or semantically consistent relation
to the verbal formative. With -marutha, for example, the suffixed
nominal is ""destination"" of the corresponding main verb. With the verbal
ablative -wulatha, whose corresponding free form bula-tha means 'pull
off, remove', the suffixed nominal is always the source, never the object
(the thing pulled). Such irregular semantic relationships are more
reminiscent of nominal compounding, with its inexplicit and varied
relationships between formatives, than of serial verbs, where the added
argument is always the object of the serial verb.","[193, 194]"
"19In fact there is a corridor of languages with tense-dependent nominal forms
running south from the Tangkic group through Kalkatungu and Pitta Pitta to the
closely related dialects Gurnu and Bägandji (Hercus 1982) on the Darling River. In
these last two languages, however, special pronominal forms are involved, rather than
the alternative case frames found in Pitta Pitta and Kalkatungu; a Gurnu example is
wadhu Ί-past', gadhu Ί-future' (Wurm—Hercus 1976). A third variation on the
same functional theme is found in Karrwa (Furby—Furby 1977: 51-2). Here past
tense is signalled by a morpheme yi which may follow the verb stem or replace the
final vowel of one pronoun in the clause; future tense is marked by a clitic -dja,
optionally attached as either a suffix or a prefix to one word (of virtually any type).
Both past and future marking, it seems, are half-frozen tense clitics. The closely
related language Wanyi (Breen to appear) has a similar system.
20It is interesting that Capell (1979) suggested that Tangkic, Kalkatungu and
Kairwa are each isolate groups in the Gulf area.

Heath's (1978) classic book on ""intense lexical diffusion"" in Arnhem land
mentions diffusion of nouns (including kin terms) and verbs, but not pronouns,
although he makes no specific reference to this.",[59]
"5.2PronounsKayardild has a rich set of free form pronouns, distinguishing person
(first person exclusive and inclusive, second, and third) and number
(singular, dual and plural). Apart from minor differences (5.2.2), the
pronominal case system is identical to that of other nominal subclasses.
There are no bound pronouns in Kayardild, unless one counts the
slightly contracted 3sg form ni (cf. the full form niya) sometimes placed
after the verb in narrative (3.2.1). The issue of whether proto-Tangkic
had bound pronouns is discussed in 10.4.3.
Pronouns are mainly used with human referents, but also with other
animates (e.g. dugong in 5-92 and fish in 11-40), and with places when
these are seen as personifications of mythical beings (Text 4, Line 18).
Elsewhere demonstratives are used (5.3.2.2).
5 . 2 . 1 Stem forms
At most three stem variants occur: nominative, possessive pronoun, and
""subject oblique"". The ""subject oblique"" form is limited to the2025 Nominate, Part IIpronominal subjects of clauses complementized with the OBLique case
(12.1.1). The first inclusive has an alternative non-singular form ngakinda with a simplified stem. First person inclusive forms of the subject
oblique do not occur, since clauses with first inclusive subjects select the
complementizing locative (12.1.4).
All other case suffixes are added to the possessive pronoun stem (all
Declension 6). The lsg possessive pronoun stem, for example, is ngijinda; from this we obtain the first singular LOCative ngijin-ji(ya), the first
singular PROPrietive ngijin-ju(ru), the first singular verbal dative ngijinmarutha, and so on.","[228, 229]"
"12.6 The evolution of complementizing case547identity (unmarked) or non-identity (marked) between matrix and
subordinate subjects.
Still later, in modern Kayardild, the choice between LOCative and
OBLique (ex DATive) cases was reanalysed and aligned with the person of
the subject, with LOCative used wherever the subject includes a second
person referent (12.1.4).
How this happened remains a mystery. One possibility is that the

Nominate, Part IThe nominal word class includes a number of subclasses (3.1):
noun/adjectives, pronouns, locationals, and manner and time nominals.
In this chapter I discuss the case system, which is essentially identical for
all nominal subclasses, plus a few nominal suffixes for number and the
like. Derivational, compounding and reduplicational processes in the
noun/adjective subclass, and specific properties of the remaining nominal
subclasses will be treated in the next chapter.","[148, 149]"
"7.3 Final inflections: a comparative note275note the parallel properties of the (possibly cognate) Anindilyakwa past
inflection -ja.
In proto Tangkic, as in the above languages, most verb types
deriving from nominalizations inflected for case were restricted to
subordinate clauses. Their main clause use evolved later (10.4.2.3). If
the -TU- and -na(ng)- thematics were originally nominalizations, this
would explain why they could host the case inflections discussed above,
and also why further
case inflections, in the form of the
""complementizing case"" discussed in Chapter 12, are allowed.
Significantly, the Kayardild desiderative, which does not derive from a
nominalization, does not allow further case inflection (12.1.6).
(ii) This hypothesis also fits in with the account given in 10.4 of how
modal case evolved. Most modal cases are related to the case-like final
component of some pT verb inflection. This is what we would expect of
complement clauses with case markers both on the nominalized verb and
its arguments.
7 . 3 . 4 Reconstruction of final inflections: summary
The evidence assembled above suggests that all pT verb inflections, with
exception of the imperative -ka, the irrealis imperative -ki and the
desiderative -da , derived from nominalizations inflected for case. For
positive nominalizations the nominalizing base was -TU-, identical to the
indicative suffix; for negative nominalizations it was -na(ng)-.
This reconstruction is based on very restricted evidence: on
morphology alone, and verb morphology at that. Before we can
understand the wider causes of these changes, we must place the verbal
suffixes in a broad syntactic perspective. This will be done in 10.4,
where I argue that the above verb inflections were originally limited to
subordinate clauses, in which a complementizing case appeared on both
the nominalized verb and its nominal arguments. These complementizers
coded relative tense/mood between clauses: simultaneity with the
LOCative, anteriority with the CONSequential, and so on. Later, the
complementized clauses were ""insubordinated"" (i.e. reinterpreted as main
clauses) and the complementizing cases came to code absolute rather
than relative tense.
The scenario presented here and in Chapter 10 leaves us with a rather
puzzling proto language: rich in interclausal relations, but poor in its
stock of main clause tense/mood categories. Indeed, McConvell (1981)
effectively proposes that one reason for the subsequent insubordination
was to enrich the inventory of main clause categories. One possible
explanation for this is that the proto language, or its predecessor, was
wholly or partly pidginized, leading to a drastic simplification of the2767 Verbalsverbal inflections; these were then replaced by case-inflected nominalized
verbs. This would account for the almost total lack of verb inflections
relatable to those in any other group—only the imperative -ka is cognate
with the set of inflections Dixon reconstructs for ""proto-Australian"".
Unfortunately, however, very little is known about pidginization
between Australian languages, as against between Indo-European and
non-European ones, and until more is known about this it is hard to
assess how plausible the changes suggested above really are.
A second possibility, also implicit in McConvell's scenario, is that in
proto-Tangkic, tense was not marked on the verb but on the auxiliary, as
in Yukulta. Loss of this auxiliary in Kayardild and Lardil created a need
for a new means of tense marking, which was met by the process of
insubordination described above. Note that something very similar to this
appears to have happened in the nearby languages Karrwa and Wanyi:
It seems that Wanyi and Garawa have lost a system of auxiliaries
which presumably hosted bound pronouns. They retain old infinitives
which now represent the neutralisation of a number of previous
distinctions probably including tense and aspect. Garawa seems to
have developed a new system of marking tense and aspect via clitic
particles and Wanyi ... seems to be getting by without such a
distinction. (Blake 1990: 64)7.4 Derivations: verb-verb
These come between the stem and the final inflection.
The conjugation they recruit into is shown here by the following
ACTual suffix. For instance the middle suffix {-yii-}, which always
derives palatal conjugation verbs, will be represented as {-yii-ja}. And
the iNCHoative, which always derives dental conjugation verbs, will be
represented as -wa-tha.
7 . 4 . 1 Middle{-yii-ja}The middle suffix has a number of allomorphs.
Stems ending in a long vowel (which are all in the palatal
conjugation) shorten this vowel and add -yii-. I have no examples with
root final ii.","[301, 302, 303]"
"1784 Nominals, Part Iof (4-154) is ""SUBJ cause OBJ to move to INCORP"" where INCORP is the
incorporated NP.
A satisfactory representation of verbal case, then, requires verb-like
argument structures, making reference to several (typically three) NP
arguments and their grammatical functions. But it must also allow verbal
case to distribute over every word in the NP, or, alternatively, to
incorporate as a prefix every word in the NP. How this is done will
depend on the syntactic theory being used, and I will not go into this
question here.
The two alternatives of ""distribution"" and ""incorporation"" imply
different representations—the former more case-like, the latter more
verb-like. Historically the Verbal Allative arose through distribution, the
other verbal cases through noun-verb compounding.
4 . 4 . 3 . 2 Non-conflicting grammatical functions. Like comembers of a verbal complex (8.2), main verbs and verbal cases must
assign non-conflicting grammatical functions to the core NPs in their
clause. In the following clause schemas both main verb and verbal case
have the same subject and the same object:
(4-155)AwuujaC -maruthaΒA (SUBJ) gives Β (OBJ) to C(4-156)AwuujaB-wujaA (SUBJ) gives C (OBJ) ΒC4.4 Verbal case179(4-157)
OBJ-SUBJOBJ-A (SUBJ) pulls Β (OBJ) away from CTwo verbal cases may be present, provided they and the verb all have the
same subject and object:
(4-158)
OBJ-A (SUBJ) chases Β (OBJ) to D away from CNote also that the possibility of using the middle form of the verbal case
with -wulatha and -waalutha does not create problems, since intransitive
and transitive verbs may combine in verb complexes provided they have
the same subject (8.2). Our requirement stipulates only that the relations
of each coverb not conflict, not that each coverb must govern the same
number of relations.
(4-159)SUBJA (SUBJ) paddles Β (OBJ) off CThe principle of non-conflicting relation assignment, applied to verbal
cases, also accounts for certain co-occurrence restrictions between verbal1804 Nominate, Part Icases. Wuuja, for example, has two argument frames involving verbal
cases (plus others with normal cases—see 9.2.5). It may select the
Theme (i.e., the entity transferred) as object, with the verbal dative on the
Recipient (4-155), or the Recipient as object, with the verbal donative
case on the Theme (4-156). But it may not select both the verbal dative
and the verbal donative cases. We can now see why: the verbal dative
would select the theme as object and the verbal donative would select the
recipient, leading to conflicting assignment of grammatical relations.
Ignoring the question of what grammatical relations are assigned by the
main verb:
(4-160)4 . 4 . 3 . 3 . Restrictions on argument status. In all my corpus there
is not a single example of a NP taking a verbal case being relativized on,
or being the pivot in any complex construction. This may be an accidental
gap, but more likely it reflects the less-than-full argument status of such
constituents.
4 . 4 . 4 Discussion
4 . 4 . 4 . 1 Origins. As we have seen, the verbal case system integrates
complex verbals of quite different provenance. The allative was formed
by deriving an inchoative verb from a nominal inflected for the locative
case. Formation of all the other cases involved prefixation of nominals to
verbals, but the case relation originally obtaining between the prefixed
nominal and the verb varied considerably: proprietive with the verbal
purposive and donative cases, ablative with the verbal ablative and
evitative, and locative with the verbal dative.
Comparative evidence suggests that the fully-fledged verbal case
systems in Kayardild and Lardil have evolved quite recently. Yukulta has
two verbal cases, corresponding to the Verbal Ablative and Verbal
Evitative in Kayardild. Corresponding to other verbal cases in Kayardild,
Yukulta has non-productive patterns of derivation (e.g. kalarr-i-watha
[open space-LOC-lNCH] 'come out into the open') or nominal prefixation
(with marlutha 'put' and janija 'look for'). The verbal case systems
almost certainly evolved by increasing the productivity of these
formations, and by expanding the scope from word to phrase.","[204, 205, 206, 207]"
"It could be argued that the ABLative and PROPrietive here are ""deriving""
adjectives (cf. Dixon 1972, Blake 197712). But elsewhere in the
grammar there is no good reason for setting up an adjective class in
Kayardild, since (a) there are no morphological distinctions between
nouns and adjectives, and (b) nominals may modify other nominals
within complex NPS in a number of ways (e.g. generic-specific,
part-whole etc.— 6.3), only one of which could be called ""adjectival"". It
is therefore more consistent with other parts of the grammar to say that
adnominals are, syntactically, one type of nominal modifier, than to call
them ""derived adjectives"".
This is not to deny that certain adnominal suffixes cannot also
function derivationally, in the sense of deriving new lexemes. The
PROPrietive, for example, is a productive derivational suffix—see 4.3.5
for discussion and examples. But other adnominal suffixes, such as the
GENitive and ABLative, do not function derivationally.
3 . 4 . 2 . 1 Concord, double case-marking
and
suffix
ordering. When modifying a non-nominative head, adnominal suffixes
are followed by a further suffix agreeing with their head:

' ... with this man's good raft.'mirra-nguni
good-INSTRwalbu-nguni
raft-INSTRDouble case-marking follows from the ""total concord"" principle in
Kayardild, which distributes case inflections, whatever level they
originate at, over all subconstituents. This may be formulated in a general
way as:
(3-22)X n [ß C a s e (> α case...)] ~ >
xn"" ! [ γ Case, β Case (, a Case...)]Υ[ β Case (, α Case...)]This is similar to rules for feature inheritance that have been proposed for
other languages, except that the percolation of features can continue
12In addition to Dixon's and Blake's arguments within the Australianist literature,
Plank (1990) points out more generally that ""for nouns in an attributive relation to
agree with their head nouns in case .... is apparently so out of the ordinary that
grammarians faced with it feel tempted to annul it terminologically, by labelling caseagreeing attributive nouns adjectives solely on the strength of their agreeing in case"".
He names Bopp (1848), in his treatment of Georgian, as the first to do this.",[132]
"In these examples I have supplied two glosses for the relevant
morphemes—one relating to its more basic and normal case function
(locative, ablative, proprietive); the other to its semantic content—
""prior"" in (1-9), ""future"" in (1-10) and (1-13), ""emotive"" in (1-11), and
""instantiated"" in (1-12). In the rest of this grammar I shall in general
only use the first type of gloss, but will use the second type when it is
relevant—for example when arguing about the semantics of the modal
case categories. In addition to the four categories just given there is a
""directed"" category, marked by the modal allative and signalling
inceptive aspect or direction of the event towards the speaker, and a
'zero' category, marked by the absence of modal case, which is used in
imperatives (e.g. 1-1) and progressive nominalizations.
Modal case—which as far as I know is unique to the insular Tangkic
languages—appears to have evolved from two sources. A detailed
comparative-historical study is in 10.4; for the moment these sources can
be summarized as
(a) the use of case to show interclausal relations (e.g. locative on all
words in a subordinate clause to show simultaneity); this construction
was later generalized to main clause use.",[30]
"To show how we can get four layers of case marking, it is first
necessary to explain a further use of case in Kayardild: the OBLique and
LOCative cases may ""complementize"" clauses, appearing on all words
(including the verb) of the subordinate clause, after all other inflections 1 .
Example (1-16) illustrates this use; the gloss COBL stands for
'complementizing function of OBLique case'. As the word
thabujukarranguninaantha
illustrates, nouns may accumulate four levels
of case inflection: in this case an adnominal genitive, an instrumental by
agreement with 'net', a modal ablative coding ""prior"" tense, and a
""complementizing"" oblique marking all words in the clausal complement
ofmungurru 'know'.",[31]

The modal case systemThe ""modal case"" system is one of the most unusual and interesting
features of Kayardild grammar. We have already seen how suffixes
whose basic function is adnominal or relational can be used to signal
modality (3.4.3); that these follow adnominal or relational case suffixes
but precede associating and complementizing suffixes (4.1), and that
their domain is, roughly, all NPs except subjects and those associated
with subjects. Their correlation with verb inflections for tense, mood and
aspect was discussed, in simplified fashion, in 7.2.2. The present
chapter draws together the discussion of modal case as a system.
Firstly (10.1) I review the correlations between modal case and
verbal tense/mood/aspect. For a subset of sentence types modal case
seems to be distributed across the VP, appearing as modal case on NPs
and as the termination on verbs. With other sentence types the many-toone relation between verb-inflections and modal case invites an analysis
in which modal cases code superordinate categories subsuming the more
specific categories marked on the verb. Even this analysis, however, is
too simple: to a limited extent modal case can be varied independently of,
or in the absence of, verb inflection.
In 10.21 discuss the semantic overlap between modal and adnominal
or relational uses of case. There is, I argue, a parallel between modal case
and the widespread use of local cases or prepositions as
complementizers. But where the complementizer use of local case codes
temporal or modal relations between clauses, i.e. relative tense/modality,
modal case codes absolute relations between a single clause and the
speech act.
In 10.3 I examine the domain of modal case in more detail. This
roughly corresponds to the VP. But certain NPs, that the ""associating
OBLique test"" (9.4.1.1) show to be inside the VP, nonetheless exhibit
""modal blocking"", escaping modal case: e.g. PROPrietive ""intentional
objects"". I argue that these are ""semantically oriented"" to the subject in
the sense that a statement of their meaning must refer to the subject. A
parallel is drawn between modal blocking and ""ergative agreement"" in
other Australian languages.
In 10.4 I use comparative data from within the Tangkic subgroup to
show how the modal case system evolved. Two factors in the proto
language combined to produce the modal case systems found in
Kayardild, Lardil and Yangkaal: (a) the replacement in main clauses of
fully transitive ergative constructions by detransitivized case frames10.1 Verbal tense/mood and modal case categories399under certain semantic conditions, and (b) the use of local cases as
complementizers, marked over the verbs and NPs of subordinate clauses.
With ""insubordination""—the reinterpretation of subordinate as main
clauses—these complementizers became markers of absolute rather than
relative tense/modality. Since both (a) and (b) type constructions were
morphologically accusative, the evolution of modal case is closely bound
to the abandonment of morphological ergativity in Kayardild, Yangkaal
and Lardil.","[424, 425, 426]"
"41 The language and its speakers(b) the existence of a number of detransitivized case frames, responsive
to modality, negation and inverse person combinations, in which the
object is marked with an oblique case—the locative, dative, or
proprietive.
The second unusual feature of Kayardild is the extent of agreement:
in general, case percolates down indefinitely from higher to lower
constituents, with the result that in certain types of construction deeply
embedded nominals (such as adnominal possessives) may accumulate up
to four case suffixes.
To begin with, adnominal NPs (including possessives marked with
the ABLative or genitive) agree in case with their heads. Thus in (1-14)
'man' takes both an inner ablative, marking its role as possessor, and an
outer instrumental, inherited from 'net', head of the NP:
(1-14)dangka-karra-nguni
man-GEN-INSTR
'with the man's net'mijil-nguni
net-INSTRNow the appropriate modal case will appear on the object and
instrumental NPs:
(1-15)maku-wa
woman-NOMyalawu-jarra yakuri-na
catch-PST
fish-MABLdangka-karra-nguni-na
man-GEN-INSTR-MABLmijil-nguni-na

"Chapter 7
Verbals7.1IntroductionThe morphological class of verbals includes three functional types: verbs
proper, which function as predicators (e.g. raaja 'spear'), adverbals,
which only occur together with a main verb (e.g. bakiija 'all S do, do to
all O'), and verbal cases, which function like cases, attaching to each
subconstituent of a NP. Despite their functional differences, these three
types have identical possibilities for inflection and verb-verb derivation.
All verbals, regardless of function, belong to either of two
conjugations, ""dental"" or ""palatal"" (7.2.1). Conjugation membership is
largely determined phonologically (7.2.4).
We begin this chapter by discussing the functional relationships
between verbal inflection, the systems of modal and verbal case, and the
preverbal clitics and particles that may mark tense/mood. In 7.1.2 we
summarize the structure of the verbal word; then in 7.2 the form and
function of each verbal inflection is presented in detail. In 7.3 I attempt a
reconstruction of the proto Tangkic system of verb inflections, arguing
that all but the imperative and desiderative derive historically from
nominalizations inflected for case. We then turn to the various verb-verb
(7.4) and nominal-verb (7.5) derivations, certain nominal suffixes that
may follow the verb inflection (7.6), verbal reduplication (7.7), and
nominal prefixation (7.8).
7 . 1 . 1 Kayardild verbal inflection in its functional context
To a greater extent than in most languages, the signalling of tense, aspect
and mood in Kayardild integrates a number of interdependent systems.
Supplementing the many distinctions coded by verbal inflection is the set
of six modal cases (3.4.3; 10.1); although in the majority of cases these
could be considered to show a sort of concord with the verbal inflections,
there are nonetheless many examples of their ""independent"" use (10.1.3).
Aspectual distinctions can be expressed by nominalizing the verb
(7.2.3.13), by preverbal particles, or by aspectual complexes; persistence
may also be expressed using the ' S A M E ' clitic (9.7.4.1). And
""insubordinated"" clauses—main clauses bearing a complementizing
case—may be used to express certain evidential categories (12.4).","[278, 279]"
"What is important, then, is not that each verb have identical argument
structures, but merely that they have non-conflicting argument structures:
it is acceptable for a NP to be an object of one verb in a clause but bear no
grammatical relation to its clause-mate, but it is unacceptable for a NP to
be subject of verb A and object of verb B.
This contrasts with the stricter constraint found in many
morphologically ergative Australian languages (such as Dyirbal
(Dixon 1972: 64), Yidiny (Dixon 1977a: 252), Ngiyambaa (Donaldson
1980: 203) and Kalkatungu (Blake 1979b)) which requires that all verbs
and adverbs in a verb complex agree in (surface) transitivity. If we accept
Goddard's (1982) argument that such languages have three core cases,
ergative (A), nominative (S) and accusative (O), the reason is clear: if
transitive and intransitive verbs were mixed in a clause, they would
assign conflicting cases (ergative and nominative, or nominative and
accusative) to their subject. In an accusative language like Kayardild, on
the other hand, there are no grounds for distinguishing A and S cases,
these being joined in a single ""nominative"" case, so there can be no case
clash.
The various elements of the VC may be more or less tightly linked,
both syntactically and semantically; three types can be identified. I shall
now examine these, proceeding from the looser to the tighter.
8 . 2 . 1 Adverbial complexes
These comprise a verb and either an adverb or a verb used as an adverb,
typically with some semantic modification. The entire complex is always
spanned by a single intonation contour, and the adverb typically precedes
the verb.
8 . 2 . 1 . 1 Lexical adverbs. Adverbs take normal verbal inflections
but cannot be the sole verbal in a sentence. Kayardild has very few, and3048 Structure of the verbal groupit is possible that a bigger corpus would see even these used as main
verbs.
(a) bakii-ja 'altogether' 1 means either 'all S do (plural subject)' or 'S do
with all his/her being' (singular subject), or 'do to all O', but never 'all A
do', which requires the particle maarra 'all' (9.7.2.7) or the nominalized
form bakii-n-da 'all', which can modify nominals in any function.

"50412 Finite subordinate clauses1 2 . 2 . 5 Comparison between odd-pivot and switch-reference
marking
It may be useful at this stage to compare Odd Pivot marking (OP) in some
detail with the related phenomenon of ""switch-reference"" (SR) marking,
which signals the identity or otherwise of successive clausal subjects. In
characterizing SR I am drawing on works by Jacobsen (1967), Austin
(1981c), Haiman—Munro (1983) and Stirling (1993); although not all
scholars would agree on the exact characteristics of SR, I believe the
following would be accepted by most as typical, particularly in Australian
languages.
(a) Both are reference tracking devices. But where SR tracks arguments
in the same grammatical function, canonically subjects,5 and evaluates
their identity or otherwise, OP tracks referentially identical arguments and
evaluates their grammatical function: are they subject of both clauses?
(b) Both appear to code information about referential identity/non-identity
elsewhere than on the relevant nominal arguments themselves. The fact
that SR systems typically employ verbal suffixes (Diyari, Arrernte),
particles (e.g. in Pima; see Langdon—Munro 1979) or conjunctions
(Yankunytjatjara), while OP marking is realized by case marking over a
whole clause, is of no particular significance. Verbal suffixes, particles
and conjunctions are all classic means of coding functions with clausal
scope, and case-marking over a whole clause is another such means,
uncommon cross-linguistically but consistent with the rigorous concord
found at all levels of Kayardild syntax. The formal similarity between OP
marking and SR becomes all the more obvious when one considers that in
most Australian languages SR verbal suffixes incorporate case
inflections, at least diachronically (Austin 1981c, Dench—Evans 1988).
Although it has been asserted that SR is ""weird"" because ""it seems to
violate very general iconic tendencies whereby categories which define
properties of nouns are expressed by nominal affixes"" (Haiman 1983), I
believe it is misleading to see either SR or OP as categories limited to
particular nominal arguments.
For one thing, the information provided by SR usually extends
beyond the identity of one argument. As Heath (1983) points out, by
knowing that clauses have identical subjects we also know that the
subordinate object, for example, is different from the main clause
subject. As we saw above, SR and OP rules give similar results for most
5See Stirling (1993: 32ff) for a discussion of various non-canonical SR systems,
such as those in which requirements of agentivity or topicality are added to the
requirement of subjecthood.","[530, 531]"
"1344 Nominals, Part I4.3 Nominal case functions
Although all inflectional functions of nominals are mentioned at least
briefly in this chapter, the main focus is on adjunct and complement
functions, which can be characterized semantically without reference to
larger grammatical units. The core functions of subject, object and
indirect object, whose meaning depends on the argument structure of
their governing verb, are discussed in Chapter Nine.
4 . 3 . 1 Approach to case meanings
Case meanings in Kayardild exhibit a structured polysemy of complex
meanings. Summary labels of the type found in Fillmore's (1968) ""deep
cases"" or the ""thematic relations"" originally proposed by Gruber (1965)
and incorporated into various types of generative theory may be useful
summary labels, but they are inadequate for describing the meaning, and
the syntactic properties, of Kayardild case. Taking the thematic relation
of ""goal"" or ""purpose"" as an example, Kayardild distinguishes the
following (needless to say, many situations can be described by more
than one of these):
(a) the ""goal"" or ""intentional object"" of actions aimed at locating
something, e.g. 'look for', 'listen for', 'walk around for'. This takes the
PROPrietive.
(b) ""conventionally recognized goal"" specifying what something is
obtained for, e.g. 'get wood for (the fire)'. This takes the UTlLitive case.
(c) something that can be found at a predictable place, e.g. 'go down to
the pub for (beer)', 'go digging at place A for (cockles)'. This takes the
Intransitive ALLative (verbal) case.
(d) something that must be waited for, whose appearance depends on
someone else, e.g. 'go for (the pension cheques)'. This takes the (verbal)
TRANSlative case.
(e) something that is actively pursued, as when one charters a plane to go
to Burketown for beer. This takes the Verbal PURPosive case.
Similarly, there are at least three ways of expressing cause (prior cause
with the CONSequential, ambient cause with the LOCative, and cause of
fear with the verbal EVITative), two ways of expressing the ""having""
relationship (ownership, with the PROPrietive, and temporary
possession, with the Associative), three ways of expressing instruments
(INSTRumental, stressing contact with the object; PROPrietive, stressing4.3 Nominal case functions135the choice of a particular instrument; and Associative, stressing
temporary use), and so on.
The effect of these differences in meaning is not limited to selection
of the correct relational or adnominal case. In Chapter 10 I show that
modal case is blocked from appearing on certain NPs whose meaning
orients them towards the subject in some way.
In the following two sections I therefore devote considerable attention
to characterizing, in an informal way, the various specific meanings of
the Kayardild cases. For reasons of space I have not been able to tackle
systematically the question of the relationships between the various
meanings of each case, but have tried to bring these out through the orderCASEADNOMINAL FUNCTIONRELATIONAL FUNCTIONLOCativespatial contiguity

verbal and ordinary Kayardild cases1364 Nominals, Part Iof presentation. Interestingly, this often crosscuts the functional
classification into adnominal, relational and modal uses. The PROPrietive,
for example, can be used with its ""having"" meaning adnominally,
relationally, and also in deriving nouns of ""characteristic possession"".
And it can be used with a ""potential"" or ""future-oriented"" meaning
relationally (marking intentional objects), modally, or in deriving
""potential nominalizations"".
Despite the above, however, it is useful to begin with an overview of
the basic semantic values of each case. In Figure 4-31 give a summary of
these values for the adnominal and relational functions of all case
suffixes; those for the verbal cases, which form part of the semantic
system, are also shown. No value is shown for the nominative, whose
presence simply signals the lack of any relational, modal, associating or
complementizing case. Cases are grouped into semantic classes as far as
possible.
We now turn to a more detailed discussion of individual case
meanings.

the subjects of intransitive (4-13), transitive (4-5) and passive (9.3.2)

predicates on the subject (9.4), and topicalized objects in ""odd topic""
constructions (12.5.2.1) are also nominative.

"10.4 Evolution of the Tangkic modal case systems449Such a system would be under some functional pressure to recruit new
main clause categories, as McConvell argues, and the rich system of
subordinate clause types would have provided an obvious model: as
argued above, the syntactic shift from subordinate to main clause status
was accompanied by a semantic shift from relative to absolute tense.
The historical productivity of this process in the Tangkic languages is
emphasized by the occurrence in Κ of a second round of insubordination,
to be discussed in Chapter 12: a second, outer layer of complementizing
case suffixes may also be used in main clauses. These either indicate the
ellipsis of a matrix perception, utterance or command predicate, or extend
to main clauses the ""odd pivot"" tracking mechanisms originally applied
only between matrix and subordinate clauses.
In summary, then, the sweeping morphological and syntactic changes
undergone by die insular Tangkic languages cannot be attributed to sound
changes which wiped out key inflections in pT, as Klokeid and
McConvell propose. Rather, the reasons appear to have been functional:
the ancestors of Lardil and Kayardild-Yangkaal had a meagre set of main
clause tense/mood categories, but a rich set of subordinate clause types.
They redressed this imbalance by allowing the subordinate types to be
used in main clauses as well. In the process, old ""t-complementizing
case"" was imported as new ""modal case"".
This had the effect of increasing the number of accusative-type
constructions allowed in main clauses: alongside the accusative
""detransitivized"" constructions were three (L) or six (K) old subordinate
constructions, also accusative, compared to the one ergative construction,
only possible in indicatives, imperatives and realis desideratives. To this
might be added the non-distinctness of the subject and object pronoun
forms in the ergative construction, whereas they were distinct in
detransitivized and subordinate construction types. It is not surprising
that in the end the accusative constructions were fully generalized and the
ergative construction fell into disuse.27
There is no evidence that the above syntactic changes served to
realign morphological and syntactic categories, a mechanism Dixon
(1977b) credits with certain changes in Dyirbal and Yidiny, and also
relevant in the development of morphological accusativity in languages of
the Ngayarda group, which were already syntactically accusative (Dench
1982). The relation between case-assignment and syntactic function was
undoubtedly complicated in pT, but it has become even more so in K, Ya
and L: in addition to the complicated tense/modality-dependent marking
of objects found in all three, L in particular has a daunting array of
27
Note, however, that Κ does have two constructions that could be considered
ergative: resultative nominalizations, probably a recent innovation (11.4.3), and the
bakiija qualifier construction (8.2.1.1). Lardil also has a newly-developed ""objecttopicalization"" construction that could be considered ergative (McConvell 1981:172-6).","[475, 476]"
"Kayardild's four most unusual features all involve case morphology.
Firstly, it uses nominal suffixes that are formally identical with case
markers (and represent historical extensions of case functions) to
indicate tense, aspect and mood on non-subject NPs such as objects or
instruments: I call this ""modal case"".
Thus in (1-4) the locative is used to indicate actuality, in (1-9) the
ablative is used to indicate pastness, and in (1-10) the proprietive is used
to indicate futurity. Throughout this grammar I indicate this ""modal""
function of case marking by glossing it with Μ for 'modal', e.g. MABL
'modal (function of) ablative'. Note that with instruments (as with most
complements and adjuncts) the ""modal case"" suffix follows the
instrumental case, while objects take only the ""modal -case"" suffix. There
is no accusative case in Kayardild.

"Kayardild verbal case forms1664 Nominals, Part IThe clear origin of the verbal case suffixes as either derivational
suffixes or free verbs suggests two alternatives to their treatment as
category-changing case inflections. Although neither is adequate, they
have sufficient initial plausibility that I shall review each before passing
on to a detailed discussion of individual case meanings.
4 . 4 . 1 . 2 Are verbal cases derived motion verbs? One
alternative, particularly tempting with the Verbal Allative, would be to
treat these arguments as a type of derived motion verb, obtained by first
inflecting a noun for the LOCative, then adding the INCHoative suffix. To
illustrate this analysis, consider the Yukulta sentence (4-111) where, I
would claim, genuine derivation is at work:
(4-111)
Ydangka-ra=ngka warra-ja kalarr-i-wa-tha / natha-rlu
man-ABS=PRES
go-IND open-LOC-INCH-IND
'The man is going into the open / to the camp.'camp-ALLFrom the noun kalarr- 'open space, clearing', we first get the LOCative
kalarr-i 'in the open space', then add the INCHoative suffix -watha to
derive a new verb kalarriwatha meaning 'become in an open space' or,
more idiomatically, 'emerge, come out into the open' 19 . This may be
used in a coverbal construction with a motion verb, as in (4-111). And
the verb kalarriwatha is at least partly interchangeable with an ALLative
noun phrase like natha-rlu 'to the camp'.
But in Yukulta, unlike in Kayardild, this process is not productive—
in fact, kalarriwatha is the only derived word of this type in Keen's
Yukulta corpus. What is more, it applies to a word rather than a NP—one
could not use this with a phrase like 'into the large clearing'. In short, the
Yukulta formation is non-productive, and lexical rather than phrasal.
These features stamp it as a derivation.
In Kayardild, by contrast, the process is productive—any
semantically appropriate NP can take the verbal allative case. And it
applies to phrases, as in (4-109), not just to words; this distinguishes it
from the derivational suffix -watha 'become', which is limited to words
and therefore defined as derivational by the criteria given in 3.1.2.1. For
these two reasons, the Kayardild verbal allative, unlike its Yukulta
cognate, must be treated as an inflection.
This is not to say, however, that it did not originate as a derivation. It
is likely that Yukulta preserves an earlier state of affairs, where the
LOC:INCHOATIVE sequence was derivational, and that Kayardild (and19Derivation of verbs from inflected nouns is quite common in Australian
languages. A Warumungu example is walypali-kirra-jarri-mi [whitefellow-ALL-INCHPST] 'become like a whitefellow' (Simpson 1988).","[192, 193]"

Remodelling the antecedent-agreement principle in pre-LardilThe syntactic development of complementedclauses in Lardil569In pre-K, the LOCative case assigned to objects bore no relation to the
DATive complementizing case assigned to clauses with OBJect
antecedents. There was therefore no reason to analyse the
complementizing case suffixes as a form of antecedent agreement, and a
new set of rules were made, along the lines suggested in 12.6.2.
In pre-L, on the other hand, objects and indirect objects took the
DATive, which was identical with the complementizing case assigned to
the subordinate clause. 4 There were thus grounds for postulating a
remodelled antecedent agreement system, and extending it to the one
instance where antecedent and complementizing case did not coincide—
clauses with antecedent transitive subjects.5
The seemingly unimportant fact, described in 10.4.2.2, that Lardil
took the old DATive as the new case for objects, while Κ took the old
LOCative, has thus had enormous repercussions in quite a different part
of the grammar—the organization of cross-clausal reference tracking.","[595, 596]"
"3 . 4 . 2 Adnominal function of case inflections
Another function of case is to show the relation of one NP to another,
linking two arguments in an attributive relationship, rather than an
argument and a predicate. Traditionally this is called the ""adnominal""
function.
Besides their attributive use, all adnominal cases may be used
predicatively in nominal clauses—cf. 'the man's boomerang' and 'the
boomerang (is) the man's' (9.1.4). They may also be used as second
predicates (9.4).
The GENitive or ABLative cases, for example, may mark possessors
(3-19); they link the head noun denoting the thing possessed to a
modifying noun denoting the possessor (in this construction the two are
virtually synonymous). The PROPrietive case codes a similar
relationship, but takes the possessor as head (3-20; see 4.3 for fuller
discussion).

"42210 The modal case systemtransferred object is seen as possessed by the subject either before or
after the transaction.14
The exact semantics of ""subject orientation"" varies from construction
to construction. It is clear, however, that the determination of ""subject
orientation"" requires a far more detailed representation of case meaning
than that provided by ""thematic roles""; rather, something like
Wierzbicka's detailed explications of the Russian instrumental
(Wierzbicka 1980) may be needed.
Whenever this representation includes explicit reference to the
subject, modal blocking is appropriate. Glancing briefly through our
examples, the ""body part as instrument"" meaning includes a component
like 'SUBJ did something with X, which is part of SUBJ's body'; the
PROPrietive ""private goal"" includes a meaning component something like
'SUBJ is thinking about PROP, SUBJect wants to be in the same place as
PROP'; PROPrietive themes with transfer verbs would express a meaning
something like 'SUBJ has PROP; because of this SUBJ can cause OBJ to
have PROP' for wuuja 'give' and 'SUBJ has PROP after causing OBJ not to
have PROP' for marndija 'deprive'. In other words, the (complex)
predicates expressed by the case suffix include as arguments at least the
host NP and the clausal subject.
The meanings of the non-subject-oriented NPs, on the other hand,
may all be framed without specific reference to the subject. There are a
number of possibilities here:
(a) The predicate expressed by the case can have as arguments the host
NP and the proposition encoded by the clausal core, as with adjuncts like
the (relational) LOCative.
(b) The predicate may take as arguments the host and the object, as with
the INSTRumental of contact: 'INSTR came into contact with OBJ, causing
something to happen to OBJ'.
(c) The predicate may take as arguments the host and something else
whose identity is left to context. The ""UTlLitive of conventional purpose""
is an instance of this—a possible formulation is 'one could see the people
would use X with/to make UTIL'. Here the role of context is dual: it
supplies the identity of X, which is usually an OBJect, e.g. (4-97) to
(4-100), but may also be a second predicate on the subject (as in 10-35).
14Surprisingly, the ALLative in Kayardild does not show modal blocking. In this
respect Kayardild differs from those Pama-Nyungan languages like Warlpiri which use
ergative-agreement to stress that the subject, as opposed to the object, reaches the
destination (cf. 4.4.2.4). Perhaps the nominal ALLative in Kayardild is inherently nonspecific with regard to which entity moves; should more precision be desired, a
functionally equivalent verbal case can always be used.","[448, 449]"
"There is comparative evidence explaining this block. As I will show in
12.6.1, the Kayardild Complementizing LOCative descends from an
ergative-antecedent use of the proto-Tangkic ergative/locative. But in
Yukulta, and we may infer also in proto-Tangkic, free pronouns do not
have an ergative form distinct from the nominative. A phrase like
ngakulda bakiinki in (12-14) would have had exactly the same form in
proto-Tangkic if it had been an apposed pronoun and noun—the pronoun
would have been formally indistinct from the nominative, while the noun
would have taken the ergative/locative. Thus the failure of Kayardild
subject pronouns to show the complementizing locative simply continues
the lack of a distinct ergative form for free pronouns in proto-Tangkic.
1 2 . 1 . 4 . 2 Exploiting the LOCative/OBLique choice. With all but
second person subjects the choice between COBL and CLOC is determined
entirely by the person and number of the subject; both have identical
functions. But with second person subjects a choice exists, and is
semantically significant. CLOC, with its first inclusive affinities, is used
when the speaker wants to group him/herself with the addressee, while
COBL is used when no such grouping is sought. An example is:

2sgNOM take-PST-CLOCrawakm-maan-d](j£)Q
baler shell-ORIG-NOM
'How much money did you get from (selling) the baler shells?'",[521]
"3.1 Parts of speech and phrasal categories89In Kayardild a more fruitful test is based on the insight that inflection
essentially operates on units ""beyond the word level"", in particular on
phrases, while derivation applies to individual lexemes. In illustration of
this, inflections exhibit concord over the relevant noun phrase or verb
complex, so that 'on that beach' is dathin-ki ngarn-ki [that-LOC beachLOC], and 'will hit hard' is kurulu-thu bala-thu [kill-POT hit-POT],
Derivational suffixes, on the other hand, never show phrasal
concord, but must be limited to a single word. For example the
inchoative suffix, deriving verbs of becoming from nominals, can apply
to the word mundundunkuru
'maggot-PROP, maggotty' to give
mundundunkuruwatha
'become maggotty, become fly-blown', but not
to the phrase jungarrawuru mundundunkuru [big-PROP maggot-PROP]
'full of fat maggots'. A different construction must be employed, using a
copula with a NP complement (9.1.8). Alternatively, a new lexeme may
be derived by compounding a noun and adjective, and this compound
lexeme may then take the inchoative derivational suffix: thus nalda birdi
'bad (in the) head' yields the compound nalbirdi [head-bad] 'mad,
drunk', which may then take the inchoative derivational suffix, giving
nalbirdiwatha 'go mad, get drunk'.
In this grammar the possibility of phrasal concord will be taken as the
crucial test distinguishing inflection from derivation. This allows us to
handle the multiple inflection discussed in 3.4.7. It also enables us to
deal with suffixes which, though functionally inflections, change the
word class of their targets.
Another characteristic of inflections is that they are fully productive
and regular in meaning; whereas derivational suffixes are limited to a
small number of lexemes and often produce fairly idiosyncratic changes
in meaning. This distinction correlates well with the phrasal scope test.
Note, though, that sometimes inflectional forms may have a derivational
use, in which case their scope is limited to the word.
3 . 1 . 2 . 2 Inflections changing morphological word class.
Two types of inflection change morphological word class without
changing syntactic word class.
VERBAL CASES are morphologically verbalizing suffixes that function
in all respects like oblique cases: they are totally productive, appear on
every word of a NP, and code such case-like meanings as beneficiary,
direction of motion, purpose, and so on. For example, there is a suffix
-marutha, glossed 'Verbal Dative', having a range of dative-type
meanings, including beneficiary, recipient, communicatee, and direction
of transfer. This attaches to each word of the relevant NP. However, each
word thereby becomes morphologically verbal, and agrees in
tense/mood/polarity with the main verb. All but one of these ""verbal
cases"" derive from free verbs; the Verbal Dative, for example, derives
from a free verb marutha 'put'.","[115, 116]"
"3.3 Grammatical and discourse relations97Between the semantically unrestricted, subcategorizable core
functions of subject, object and indirect object, and the semantically
transparent and freely addable adjuncts, are a class of
complement
functions which, though semantically transparent, ""complete"" the
meaning of their predicator and would be part of a full dictionary entry
for their governing verb. The verb balatha 'hit', for example, optionally
takes a complement in the instrumental or proprietive case, denoting the
instrument used, while motion verbs optionally take complements in the
allative or ablative case, giving the direction or source of motion. Such
""semantically restricted"" complements directly reflect the underlying
meaning, but unlike adjuncts they only occur with certain verbs.
Because their meaning can be characterized directly, the main
discussion of adjuncts and complements is in Chapters 4-6, which deal
with nominals and noun phrases.
Certain verbs subcategorize ""subject complements"" or ""object
complements"", which are distinct NPs agreeing in case with subject or
object 8 . For example, there is a verb ngaarrngija meaning '(unborn child)
manifest its conception by the appearance of a sign'. This verb takes as
subject the person who has been conceived, and as subject complement
the entity appearing as a sign; both subject and subject complement take
NOMinative case—see 9.2.2.2, for example. A number of verbs
optionally take object complements; 'find' for example, takes the entity
found as object, and the state the entity was found in as object
complement, e.g. Ί found him (object) alone (object complement)'. The
range of verbs taking subject and object complements is discussed in 9.2.
3 . 3 . 1 . 2 Language-internal evidence for subject, object and
indirect object. The core grammatical functions of Kayardild, and
their defining properties, are summarized below; as we shall see, subjects
can be identified unambiguously, objects can be characterized but with
some difficulty, and the evidence for indirect objects is weak.

"10.2 From bcational to modal case meaning10.2407From locational to modal case meaningIn this section I examine the extent to which relational or adnominal
meanings can be related to the modal meanings of the same case. This
bears crucially on whether modal cases should be treated as different
functions of the same case, as suggested in 3.4.8, or as homophonous
forms quite distinct from the more usual case functions. More generally,
it answers the typological question of why modal case should exist at all.
I will argue that whereas relational cases relate the NP they mark to the
action described by the verb, and case-like complementizers in many
languages extend this to the relationship between two clauses, modal
cases relate the event described by the clause to the event of the speech
act.
The relevant cases are all, in a broad sense, locational: LOCative,
ABLative, ALLative, PROPrietive (having) and OBLique (etymologically an
old dative).8 These locational cases are essentially two-place predicates.
But there is no inherent restriction on what arguments they take. Used
adnominally (""the fool on the hill"") they take two entities (NPs) as
arguments. Used ""relationally"", they take an entity argument (e.g. a local
NP) and a proposition (the core of the clause). Used as complementizers
they take as arguments two propositions: the main and subordinate
clauses.
As the arguments being related change from NP to clause—i.e. as
""rank-shifting"" occurs—only some languages retain the same locational
markers. Yidiny, for example (Dixon 1977a:332-346), does not use
regular case suffixes as complementizers, but the subordinate verbal
inflection is formally similar (and possibly related diachronically) to a
local case.
Nevertheless, probably the commonest pattern is for local case
markers or adpositions to double as complementizers. English, for
example, uses local prepositions with the infinitive, as in ""they stood up
to applaud the musicians"". In Australia, many Pama-Nyungan languages
8Clark (1970) argues that ""possessive"" and ""having"" (here, PROPrietive)
constructions are closely related to the semantically more fundamental ""locatives"".
Although her discussion is primarily concerned with predicative constructions, it can
be applied with equal validity to attributive constructions employing adnominal
suffixes. Possessives, she maintains, are more appropriate when the ""location"" is
animate, and the thing located is not definite; the ""having"" relation is more appropriate
when the location is animate and the thing located is definite. Accordingly, she groups
existential and locative constructions (both ""hyperlocatives"") with possessive and
""having"" constructions (both ""possessives"") under the joint rubric ""locational"". Her
analysis may be extended to include the ALLative as the directional counterpart of the
LOCative and the DATive as the directional counterpart of the PROPrietive (i.e. ""want
to have"".)40810 The modal case systemmark the appropriate local case on every subconstituent of the
subordinate clause (except, of course, equi-deleted subjects), as in Djapu
(10-17, from Morphy 1983:132-3). This appears to have been the
situation in proto Tangkic (10.4.1.3).

'He has come back from seeing his father.'
(Human nominals in Djapu take OBLique case suffixes for the ablative
case function.)All of this is quite familiar, and few would dispute that genuine polysemy
is involved, with similar relationships being set up between arguments of
different types. Of course, the meanings of these relationships are not
identical—with complementizers, the temporal meaning usually
predominates over the spatial, for example—but a cluster of related but
distinct meanings is typical of case polysemy, and more generally in
""grammaticalization chains"" (Heine—Claudi—Hiinnemeyer 1991). The
important thing is that a substantial semantic overlap can be established.
The particular type of extension at issue here—that from spatial to
temporal meanings—has been known for a long time (e.g. Cassirer
1923, Kronasser 1952) and the use of locationals as temporal or
purposive complementizers, as in ""she stood up to sing"", is found
throughout the world's languages.
Modal case, because it is so unfamiliar, may not appear to follow this
pattern. I would claim, however, that it represents a further application of
the case-as-complementizer pattern, but taking as its arguments the event
of the speech act and the event expressed by the clause. The main
difference from the uses just discussed is that here only one of the
arguments—the proposition containing modal case—is overtly
expressed. The other—the (time of the) speech act event—is not
expressed by any linguistic material, but given by context.
This is typical of deictics. The word ""now"", for example, means
something like ""the time at which the event described in this proposition
happens is the same as the time at which I say this""; it could therefore be
treated as a two-place predicate taking as arguments the containing
proposition, and the context of utterance.
The difference between relative and absolute tense provides a good
analogy with the difference between complementizing and modal uses of
a local case, and in fact the evolution of modal from complementizing
case corresponded to a shift from relative to absolute tense, as we shall
see in 10.4.2.3. Relative tense involves a temporal relation between two
propositions: the main and the subordinate clause. Absolute tense, on the
other hand, involves a temporal relation between a proposition and the
context of utterance. If we think of this in terms of ""worlds"", then10.2 From locational to modal case meaning409relative tense relates the ""world in which [main clause]"" to the ""world in
which [subordinate clause]"", while absolute tense relates the ""world in
which [main clause]"" to the ""world including this speech act"".
This ""absolute"" complementizing use is far less common than the
relative complementizing use, but examples are found in a number of
Creoles. In Tok Pisin the originally spatial word klostu ('close up')
signals an ""almost"" modality, as in dispela haus klostu pundaun 'this
house is nearly falling down / nearly fell down' (Dutton 1973:101). And
in Gullah (Nichols 1975) the preposition for, as well as being a locational
marker and a complementizer, may mark modal obligation in a main
clause: where for put this 'where should one put this'.
Having noted these somewhat marginal parallels from other
languages, I would now like to examine the Kayardild modal cases from
this perspective. With the LOCative, ABLative, ALLative and PROPrietive,
I will argue, the link between modal and adnominal/relational meanings is
synchronically valid. With the OBLique, links of this type may once have
existed but have been obscured by reconstructable historical changes.
Before discussing the semantic links, a note on the problem of the
representation of the meanings to be connected. Although a number of
recent scholars within the broad ""cognitive semantics"" movement have
paid attention to space/time polysemy, their means of representing
meaning have varied widely. Some, such as Langacker (1986) have used
diagrammatic visual representations; others, such as Wierzbicka
(Goddard—Wierzbicka 1994) use verbal definitions. Although visual
representations have the advantage of conciseness, and of relating
linguistic meaning to non-linguistic schemata, they have the disadvantage
that their visual conventions may not be adequate for representing the
more complex and subtle case meanings, and more importantly it is not
clear how particular semantic components can be subjected to linguistic
argumentation. I therefore adopt, below, a definitional approach to case
meaning, using the ""natural semantic metalanguage"" developed by
Wierzbicka and her colleagues (Goddard 1989, Goddard—Wierzbicka
1994). Note that the expression ""can be thought of as"" is intended to
capture metaphorical extension.
The modal LOCative, as we have seen, marks the modality
""instantiated""; in other words it describes a state of affairs the speaker
knows to be occurring or have occurred. The choice of the LOCative,
which primarily expresses the coincidence of two entities, is obvious
enough with present events, but at first sight may appear inappropriate
for past ones. Recall, though, that the modal ABLative with the PaST
verbal inflection is used when pastness is being stressed; choice of the
ACTual verb inflection, together with MLOC, stresses the actuality of the
event. We can summarize this as follows: ""the world including this
speech act this can be thought of as in a world where [Main clause]"".","[433, 434, 435, 436]"
"10.4 Evolution of the Tangkic modal case systems
Comparative reconstruction explains many of the unusual features of the
Kayardild and Lardil modal case systems:
(a) The formal similarities between (some) verb inflections and
modal case.
(b) The appearance of modal case, in ""marked"" modalities, on virtually
all NPs in the VP.
(c) Its more restricted domain in the unmarked modality.
(d) The semantic link between modal and more basic case uses. It can
also be shown that the unusual modal case systems arose from a
relatively normal proto system.
In all modern Tangkic languages case-assignment depends on main vs
subordinate clause status, and on the verbal categories of tense/mood. In
Yukulta (and probably in the proto language) a third series of factors is
important: negation, inverse person combinations, and irrealisness can all
trigger middle constructions in underlyingly transitive sentences. Because
case-assignment depends on so many factors, it is construction type,
rather than cases considered in isolation, that must be compared across
languages and used as the basis of historical reconstruction. Fortunately
most construction types are preserved, in some guise, in at least two of
the modern Tangkic languages, increasing the certainty of our
reconstruction.",[450]
"This use of the LOCative resembles the independent use of the accusative
in Russian—of which Jakobson (1936:67) wrote :
its use always suggests a missing and implied verb: karetu !
'the carriage!', nagradu xrabrym! 'a reward to the brave!'
In such accusative addresses as Van 'ku! Lizu! (a call from
a distance or an emphatic call widely used in dialects), or in
such exclamations as nu ego (A) k leSemu 'the devil with
him!'; pust' ego (A) kutit' 'let him carouse', ""ek ego
zalivaetsja!"" (Gogol'), 'how he pours forth (song)', the
accusative object is portrayed as the object of the speaker's
attitude, be it one of speech, refusal, yielding, or
admiration
I interpret the Kayardild independent locative in a similar way, as a
special instance of the modal locative marking found on objects. That is,
it marks NPs as the objects and object complements of implied verbs of
perception. (4-28) is thus to be interpreted as '(I see) a shark (OBJ) there
coming from the east (OCOMP)', (4-30) as '(I see) son-in-law (OBJ) is
sea-crazy (OCOMP)', and (4-31) as (I see you as a) walker (OCOMP)'.
This parallels the way in which whole subordinate clauses can appear
marked with complementizing case with the main clause ellipsed—see
12.4.
4 . 3 . 3 . 5 Other uses of the LOCative. The use of the LOCative to
mark demoted agents in passives is discussed in 9.3.2.2. As a modal
case it marks ""instantiated modality"" (10.1); such modal locatives occur
frequently as the marker of objects and locations. And it may function as
a complementizing case—see 12.1.4.",[169]
"7.2 Final inflections: form and function
7 . 2 . 1 Structure of the final inflection
Final inflections can be analysed into a ""thematic"", signalling conjugation
and/or polarity, and a ""termination"", signalling tense/mood/aspect. The
affirmative and negative potential forms of the verbs raaja 'spear' and
balatha 'hit', which represent the two conjugations, will illustrate; the
proposed point of segmentation is marked by a period, since their status
as independent morphemes is not clear (7.2.2).'spear'
'hit'POTentialNEGative POTentialraa-j. u( ru)

bala-nang. ku( ru)2547 VerbalsAs with nominal case inflections, the terminations have protected forms,
found before complementizing case suffixes, and unprotected forms,
found elsewhere. Segments only appearing in the protected forms are
given in brackets.
The alternation between palatal -j- and dental -th- thematics in positive
inflections is pervasive, and entirely conditioned by conjugation
membership. All negatives but one, on the other hand, have the same
thematic, -nang-, regardless of conjugation. The remaining one, -THarri,
is based on the positive thematic plus privative -warri.
For economy, I will cite positive terms using a conjugation-neutral
variable -TH-: the positive potential form just presented would thus be
given as -THu(ru).
The APPRehensive final maintains the palatal/dental alternation, but
with a nasal rather than a stop: raa-ny.arra [spear-APPR], bala-nh.arra
[hit-APPR]; this will be represented as -NHarra .
Two inflections cannot be segmented in this way: the desiderative,
which is-da for both conjugations, and the nominalizer, -n- for both
conjugations.
Verbs will be cited in their ACTual forms, with suffix -THa .
7 . 2 . 2 Final inflections: forms
The forms of all final inflections are given in Figure 7-1.
All verb inflections but the DESiderative have terminations with
cognate case suffixes. These are given, for reference, in column 4; the
cognacy of the PaST and ALMOST inflections with the CONSequential,
and of the APPRehensive with the UTILitive, will be established by
comparative evidence, in 7.3.
Not only are the basic forms cognate, but there are also striking
similarities in allomorphy, sequence restrictions and sequence
portmanteaux:
(a) Just as PROPrietive {-kuru} is usually -(k)u word-finally, -(k)uu
before a Complementizing or Associating OBLique and -(k)uru before a
Complementizing LOCative, so POTential {-THuru } is -THu wordfinally, -THuu before COBL or AOBL, and -THuru before CLOC.
(b) The nominal OBLique cannot be followed by any case suffix.
Similarly the HORTative inflections, whose termination is cognate with
the OBLique, may not be followed by a complementizing case (4.2.3).
(c) The nominal LOCative -(k)i(ya) can only be followed by the OBLique,
giving the LOC+OBL portmanteau -kurrka (4.2.3). Similarly the
IMMEDiate -77/1, whose ending is cognate with the LOCative, cannot be7.2 Final inflections: form and function255followed by CLOC, but it can be followed by COBL, giving the
portmanteau -THurrka (12.1.5.1).
Many generalizations would therefore be captured by a synchronic
analysis which treats verb finals as thematics plus case inflections.
Unfortunately, however, it is impossible to do this consistently.
Firstly, the desiderative -da cannot be so analysed, even though it is
part of the same paradigmatic series. Secondly, verb terminations
sometimes show splits not found in the corresponding nominal: to the
nominal CONSequential case -ngarrba there correspond two verb
terminations : PRECONdition -TH.arrba and PAST -TH.arra. Thirdly, the
meanings of the verb inflections are sometimes difficult to relate
synchronically to the corresponding nominal case: the nominal OBLique
case, for example, has a purely syntactic function, and has no meaning
that can be linked synchronically to the HORTative meaning of the
corresponding verb final. (Though a diachronic explanation is
possible—10.4.2.3.)FunctionPositiveNegativeCognate caseIMPerative

analysis is discussed in 10.1. But for the present, all verb inflections will
be treated as monomorphemic.
7 . 2 . 3 Final Inflections: function
Most Kayardild verb inflections can appear both in subordinate and main
clauses; in general the subordinate use is historically prior (10.4). In this
chapter the focus is on main clause functions; the function of these
inflections in subordinate clauses is discussed in Chapter 12.

with first inclusives.

either the NOMinative or the LOCative (cf. 5.2.2).

"Once this construction becomes established the ""desist"" verb can be

negative imperative.
7 . 3 . 3 Origin of final inflections as nominalized
inflected for caseverbsThe above reconstruction suggests that most final verbal inflections
originated as nominalizations inflected for case. The thematic -TH- would
have formed affirmative nominalizations, and the modern thematic
-na(ng)- would have formed negative or privative nominalizations.
Supporting this hypothesis are two arguments:
(i) In most Australian languages, only nominalized or other non-finite
verbs can inflect for case. Many languages have special nominalized
forms distinct from finite inflections—examples are Djapu (Morphy
1983: 131-9) and Ngarluma (Simpson 1983: 28), in which nominalized
forms of the verb may inflect for a variety of cases, showing different
relations between main clause and complement. In other languages, such
as Pitta-Pitta (Blake 1979a: 218-9), Yuwaaliyay (Williams 1980),
Anindilyakwa (Dench—Evans 1988) and Djamparrpuyngu (Wilkinson
1991) one finite form, usually identical to the past or indicative, doubles
as a nominalized form. Proto-Tangkic -TH(a), which could be both
indicative and nominalization, seems to have parallelled the latter type;
4Kroskrity (1984) describes a similar phenomenon in Arizona Tewa, where
subordinate and negative clauses are formally similar. He suggests that the original
marking of negatives involved the structure 'Not [Clause (Subord.)], Clause (Aff.)'.
Subsequently, ellipsis of the affirmative clause allowed negative clauses to be
""insubordinated"".",[301]

'without the two-eared one'
'the two earless ones'I shall refer to both classes of ordering phenomenon—those where the
morphological ordering mirrors the syntax, and those where it mirrors
the semantics—by the common term ""concentric scoping"".
Double case-marking of adnominals, and the fact that adnominal
suffixes precede relational ones, thus follow from general principles
needed elsewhere in the grammar; in the case of suffix ordering these
rules are probably universal. There is no need, therefore, to treat them in
a special fashion as ""derivational suffixes"" simply because they can be
followed by other case suffixes.
In 4.1 I argue that the first rank of inflectional suffixes in Κ includes
both adnominal and number suffixes, and that this level is recursive
(needed to account for theoretically possible phrases like 'with the many
spears belonging to the two men'). The concentric scoping principle
solves the problem of ordering suffixes within the same rank, and also
accounts for the positioning of the relational case suffix outside the
adnominal/number suffixes.
3 . 4 . 2 . 2 Relational use of adnominal cases. Although their
primary use is adnominal, these suffixes may also function relationally.
The ABLative may, for example, mark the demoted agent in a passive
(9.3.2), and the PROPrietive may mark instruments or the ""intentional
objects"" of verbs like 'wait for' or 'search for' (4.3.5). The PRIVative
may likewise function both adnominally and relationally.
Rather than postulate pairs of homophonous ""adnominal"" and
""relational"" suffixes, I shall assume that a single ""case"" suffix should be
set up, but that its possible functions (adnominal vs relational) should be
distinguished. I will assume, that is, that case suffixes can have a number
of functions, and that their domain and rank depend on their syntactic
and/or semantic scope. Whether the meaning differences between modal
and relational functions of the ""same"" case in Κ are significantly greater
than those obtaining between different ""uses"" of the ""same"" case in a
more familiar language is a question I discuss briefly in 10.2.

Kayardild grammar sanctions a number of mismatches between
categories belonging to different components of the grammar—
morphological, syntactic, and semantic—and in the rest of this section I
show how this can happen, what mismatches occur, and propose a
precise descriptive terminology.
One main source of such mismatches is a class of inflections that
change the word-class membership of their constituents, so that there is a
mismatch between the syntactic and morphological categories of fully
inflected words: morphological verbs may be syntactic nouns, and
morphological nouns may be syntactic verbs. I illustrate these in 3.1.2.2,
after first spelling out, in 3.1.2.1, language-specific tests that
successfully distinguish inflectional from derivational morphology. A
second source of mismatches is the existence of constructions with nonverbal predicates, some of which are two-place; these are discussed in
3.1.2.3.
3 . 1 . 2 . 1 Phrasal inflection and lexical derivation. The
distinction between ""inflection"" and ""derivation"" is a fundamental and
traditional one, well formulated by Anderson (1982: 588): ""the central
issue ... appears to be the difference between processes which operate
with essential reference to structure beyond the word-level vs processes
which simply provide alternate words on the basis of the (word-)initial
structure of the base."" Derivational processes, that is, create new lexemes
which would be listed in a dictionary; while inflection fits these into a
larger syntactic whole.
Despite the importance of this distinction, it is not always easy to find
formal tests that will label a morpheme unambiguously as inflectional or
derivational.
One diagnostic often employed is word-position: inflectional affixes
usually lie ""outside"" derivational affixes. Among Australianists this
""followability criterion"" has become something of a standard test. Blake
(1977: 38), for example, writes of the genitive suffix in Australian
languages that ""the suffix to the possessed is usually regarded as a stemforming
affix (my italics—N.E.) and can be followed by case
inflections""; and Dixon (1980: 322-3), writing on Australian languages in
general, asserts that ""each word has an obligatory root and final
inflection; between these two constituents there can optionally occur one
or more of a number of derivational suffixes."" However, the
followability test is not suitable for Kayardild, which allows extensive
multiple inflection, with sequences of up to four case-like inflections
(3.4.7). For an overview of other Australian languages permitting
multiple case inflection, see Dench—Evans (1988).","[114, 115]"
"3.4 Functional dotnains of case inflection1013.4 Functional domains of case inflection
As we saw in 1.1, Kayardild is unusual in the number of functional
domains in which case operates. This follows from the ability of a case
marker to operate at a number of syntactic levels taking items of different
syntactic rank as its arguments. Functioning adnominally, for example, it
relates possessive and other NPs to the head of a NP; functioning as a
complementizer, it relates clauses to other clauses, and so forth. These
various functional domains are introduced and exemplified in this section;
in 3.4.8 I justify treating them all as ""case"".
Five types of functional domain (henceforth often abbreviated as
""function"") must be distinguished for Kayardild case 10 . The adnominal
function, typified by the GENitive of possession, relates one NP to
another. The relational function either relates core arguments to the verb
(e.g. nominative on subjects) or peripheral arguments like location,
destination, etc., to the clause as a whole. Modal case indicates the
mood/tense/aspect of the clause. Associating
case links NPs with
nominalized verbs. Complementizing case applies to whole clauses, and
indicates either that they are an argument of the matrix clause, or that
certain marked coreference relationships exist between matrix and
subordinate clause. With some exceptions all five functions show
complete concord over their domain—for example, when the OBLique
case is used in complementizing function it appears on all words of the
complementized clause.
Nominals may take up to four cases, whose functions follow the
order adnominal, relational, modal, then complementizing or associating;
the last two are mutually exclusive.","[127, 128]"
