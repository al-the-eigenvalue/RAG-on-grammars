4.7.6 INJUGUJA `WHAT SORT OF'
This indefinitefinterrogative is not found in my corpus of Wambaya, but is given by
Chadwick (1978:199-201). He gives the following gender forms: injuguji (I), injugujarna (II),
injugujama (III) and injuguja (Iv). He gives only one example of its use (p. 199):74
juwa.

It is interesting to note the similarity in form between this indefinite/interrogative and
wunjugu, discussed in §4.7.5. Further investigation is required.
4.8 FREE PRONOUNS
While nominals generally operate on an ergative-absolutive system of case marking, free
pronouns (except for the possessive forms) have a nominative-accusative case marking
system; thus, ergative and nominative case forms are homophonous. There is also an oblique
pronoun form which is used in the dative case and serves as the base for other case forms.
Possessive pronouns, like all other nominals, have homophonous nominative and accusative
forms. They agree in gender, number and case with the noun that they modify and are the
only pronoun forms that can occur as a modifier in a NP.
As was discussed in §4.4.3 above, there is just one nominal case that covers both ergative
and locative case functions. Unfortunately, there are no examples in the corpus of free
pronouns in the locative case and thus it is not possible to tell whether pronouns also collapse
the two cases, as all other nominals do.75 If it is found that pronouns formally distinguish
ergative and locative cases, following the line of argument presented in Goddard (1982), this
distinction should be extended to the class of nominals as a whole. Thus, the analysis
proposed here for all nominals would have to be changed such that there are two distinct
cases that simply have homophonous case marking. However, for present purposes I will
assume that pronouns behave as other nominals, but will gloss the ergative pronoun forms as
`ERG', rather than `LOC', since they are not found in locative function in the corpus.
Nominative and ergative free pronouns are relatively uncommon and are largely used for
emphatic purposes, as are singular accusative free pronouns. Dual Lind plural accusative
pronouns are used more frequently since object bound pronouns in the auxiliary register only
74The glosses in this example are mine.
75 All attempts to elicit pronouns in the locative function produced either examples involving the allative
case. or constructions which avoided the use of a pronoun all together. It may he that pronouns ate
semantically incompatible with the locative case function in Wamhaya (as they appear to he with the
instrumental case function, for example). Further research is required.","[142, 143]"

Hale's (1959) corpus contains examples in which a modifier is also inflected with -rdarra
in agreement with the noun in modifies (for example, p.39):24(4-57) Yanagunjadarranggu-rdarramaliwa-rdarra.this.IV.PL.NOM tree.IV-GROUP(NOM) big.IV-GROUP(NOM)These trees are big.
Alternatively, an agreeing modifier can be inflected with a standard plural suffix (example
(4-58)) or appear in the unmarked number (4-59).

This suffix can also be used with garnguj- to emphasise the fact that it is a big group:

In Jingili rdarra is a free form that can be placed after a noun to mark plurality (Chadwick
1975:16). The fact that it is a free form in Jingili may explain why it follows gender marking
in Wambaya, rather than inflecting for gender itself (as number suffixes usually do).
4.4 NOMINAL CASE MORPHOLOGY
The forms of the Wambaya case suffixes are given in Table 4.9. These suffixes occur with
all types of nominals except for singular demonstratives and free pronouns; these nominal
subtypes inflect slightly differently for case and are discussed in §4.6 and §4.8 respectively.
A detailed discussion of the functions of each case and any allomorphic variation follows the
table.
Wambaya is a 'split-ergative' language: free pronouns have a nominative/accusative
system of case marking and all other nominals have an ergative/absolutive case-marking
system. Although there is no nominal which makes a three-way case-marking distinction,
24 It is worth noting, however, that all these examples are of verbless sentences in which the noun and the
adjective belong to different NPs.",[98]
"12Chapter Ilanguages which are not prefixing in at least the verbal domain a re the Tangkic languages,
such as Kayardild and Lardil.3
The four genders in Wambaya are masculine (Class I), feminine (Class II), vegetable
(Class III) and neuter (Class Iv). Class membership is primarily semantically based. There are
two series of gender suffixes: those which occur in the nominative and accusative cases
(absolutive) and those which occur in all other cases (non-absolutive).4 Gender is marked on
nouns, adjectives, demonstratives and some indefinite/interrogatives.
Wambaya is a `split-ergative' language: nominals (excluding free pronouns) have an
ergative-absolutive pattern of inflection while the free pronouns have a nominative/accusative
declension. Following Goddard (1982), the class of nominals as a whole is analysed as
having a three-way case system: ergative (/locative), nominative and accusative (see §4.4).
A second position auxiliary, obligatorily present in most Wambaya clauses, contains
bound pronouns representing the subject and object arguments of the clause. This auxiliary
also contains most of the tense, aspect and mood information for the clause, and can contain
directional affixes indicating movement towards or away from the speaker. Unusually, the
auxiliary has no root.
Some further unusual aspects of Wambaya grammar include: a subjective/objective
distinction that is made by some adjectives (see §3.1), a suffix found with kinship nominals
which appears to have a reflexive possessive function (see §4.5.1.2) and some verbs which
alternate in transitivity without changing their form (see §7.2.7).
As is common for Australian languages, Wambaya is morphologically agglutinative and
the word order is relatively free.
1.1.1 THE WEST BARKLY LANGUAGES
The West Barkly language family consists of 5 languages/dialects: Jingili, Ngarnga (or
Ngarnji), Wambaya, Gudanji and Binbinka. The structure of this family can be represented
as in Table 1.1 (following Chadwick 1978:2).

5Although the Tangkic languages were originally classified by O'Grady, Voegelin and Voegelin (1966) as
Pama-Nyungan, recent discussions (namely Evans (1985, 1988, 1995a) and Blake (1988, 1990)) have
shown them to be clearly non-Pama-Nyungan.
These gender suffixes are then followed by the appropriate case suffix.
The terms 'Eastern Group' and 'McArthur' are taken from Chadwick (e.g. 1978).","[19, 20]"
"Nominals934.4.10 GENITIVE SUFFIX
The genitive suffix, along with the proprietive (§4.4.11), the privative (§4.4.12) and the
origin (§4.4.13) suffixes, is different from the case suffixes discussed above in that it
functions adnominally, relating one NP to another within one constituent. In contrast, the case
suffixes discussed above function to indicate the role of a NP within a simple clause and
therefore have a relational function (Dench and Evans 1988:2). Formally these suffixes differ
from other case suffixes in that they are inflected for gender and (except for the genitive) can
themselves be inflected for case.
The genitive suffix marks the possessor of a possessive NP and agrees in gender with the
possessed (head) noun. More commonly the dative suffix is used to mark possession (see
§4.4.4), and there are thus only a limited number of examples of the genitive suffix in the
corpus. Almost all of these examples have Class Iv agreement, but there are a few with Class
I and Class II agreement. The regular forms of the genitive suffix are nîganji (I), niganya (II)
and niganka (IV);32 irregular allomorphs are found with kinship nouns and are discussed
below. The first vowel of the regular suffix assimilates to the preceding vowel of the stem,
giving the alternative forms nuganka and naganka. The genitive suffix is attached to the nonabsolutive gender form of the noun. Some examples are:
ngajbi, juwa-nîganka.
(4-146) Nayidanga-nî guyala nguy-udi
man.I-GEN.IV
woman.II-LOC NEG

This spear belongs to the old man.
(4-148) murlu-nuganka mijangga
medicine.IV(NOM)
eye.IV-GEN.IV
eye medicine
The case suffix of the possessive phrase appears only on the head noun (i.e. on the
possessed noun); there is no case marking that follows the regular genitive suffi x. This is true
whether the head noun precedes or follows the genitive noun. Some examples of genitive
phrases with non-zero case suffixes are:
bungmanya-naganka magi-nmanji.
(4-149) Yarru ngi
camp.IV-ALL

magi-nka
bungmanya-naganka.
look.for ISG.S(PR) camp.IV-DAT old.woman.II-GEN.IV
I'm looking for the old woman's camp.
However, speakers will accept as grammatical examples in which both the possessed noun
and the genitive noun are inflected for case, although they do not produce such examples
themselves:
(4-151) Mina ngi
alangi-niganka-ni
sit

I'm sitting on the boy's bed.jalyu-ni.
bed.IV-LOC32 Stress with this suffix is irregular, falling on the second syllable: ni•ganka, etc.","[110, 111]"
"50Chapter 3Singular pronouns have homophonous nominative, accusative and ergative case forms and
then a different oblique form. Free pronouns are discussed in §4.8.
(iv) Demonstratives
Demonstratives in Wambaya make a two-way spatial distinction which is roughly
comparable to the distinction in English between `this' and `that'. Demonstratives must also
agree with their referent in case, gender and number. Like nouns and adjectives,
demonstratives can occur alone as the head of a NP, or function as a modifier. Demonstratives
are discussed in §4.6.
(v) Locational nominals
These nominals are inherently locative and include the compass directionals (langga
`north', ngîrnii `south', gagarra `east', bayungu `west'), other general directionals (gayangga
`up', jangi `down'), locational demonstratives (gili `here', gîlîyaga `there') and other
locationals such as murrgu `inside'. Although these locational nominals can be inflected with
the allative and ablative cases, they are distinguished from other nominals by not taking the
locative case; they occur uninflected in a locative NP:
(3-8)Mirra gî-n
sitmurrgu.","[67, 68]"
"Nominals81following Goddard (1982) the system as a whole can be seen to be tripartite on the basis of
the interaction between the two case-marking systems. Thus, there are three core cases: (i)
that for which the citation form of either a pronoun or an `other' nominal can be substituted
(S), (ii) that for which either the citation form of a pronoun or a marked `other' nominal can
be substituted (A) and (iii) that for which either a marked pronoun or the citation form of an
`other' nominal can be substituted (0). Following Goddard (1982) these cases will be referred
to as nominative, ergative and accusative respectively. As can be seen in the following table,
the ergative case marker in Wambaya also marks instrumental and locative case.

"The language and its speakersAmong the pronouns there is a large degree of similarity in the function and form of
regular pronouns, as well as irregularities in the system which are common to all of the
languages. One example of this is the first person dual inclusive pronoun which has a base of
the form mind(i) or mirnd(î) in all the languages, and has been adopted as the name for the
whole group. Examples of other similarities among free pronouns include the form of second
person singular free pronouns:

Ngarnga and Gudanji (e.g. mîrndaga IDU.INC.OBL)Among the bound pronouns, an example of similarity is the third person singular
masculine transitive subject forms:
gannganganigînî-Jaminjung an d Ngaliwuru (used for feminine too)
Nungali
Gudanji (present tense)
WambayaA significant degree of similarity also exists between Nungali and the West Barkly
languages in the area of gender and gender marking. All of these languages have four
genders, marked by suffix in the West Barkly languages, and by prefix in Nungali. In all
languages there is a distinction made among gender affixes according to case. In the Eastern
Group of the West Barkly languages this is a two-way distinction between absolutive gender
affixes which appear in the nominative and accusative cases, and those which appear in all
other cases, followed by regular nominal case suffixes. In Jingili and Nungali, however,
there is a three-way distinction among gender suffixes: absolutive, ergative and dative.
Unlike in Wambaya, the ergative an d dative gender suffixes in Jingili and Nungali are not
supplemented with regular nominal case affixes. There is a significant degree of
correspondence in both form and function between the gender suffixes of Nungali and the
West Barkly languages. This is discussed in Appendix B.","[22, 23]"

The dual and plural case suffixes are regular for nominals: the regular nominal suffixes are
-0 for both the nominative case and the accusative case, -ni for the ergative/locative case and
-nka for the dative case, and nominals inflected with the dual suffix take -ji in the
ergative/locative case and -ja in the dative case. The only aspect of case marking that is
unusual to demonstratives is that the singular forms have a zero inflection for the
ergative/locative case and the dative case. Usually a singular nominal would take the regular
ergative/locative and dative case suffixes (see §4.4).
Below are some selected Class I forms illustrating this morphological structure.","[130, 131]"

Possessive pronouns, like most nominals, have an ergative/absolutive case-marking
system; nominative and accusative case forms are homophonous. Table 4.19 lists the
nominative/accusative forms of the possessive pronouns, which agree in gender, number and
case with the noun that they modify (i.e. the possessed noun). A question mark following a
form indicates that the form has been inferred on the basis of other members of the paradigm,
but is not present in the corpus.

"4.5.3 NOMINAL REDUPLICATION
There are only a very small number of examples of nominal reduplication in the corpus. In
four of the six examples, reduplication is used to indicate plural number (although note that
there are other ways to mark plurality as well — see §4.3.3). In the other two examples, the
function of the reduplication is not so clear. The four examples of nominal reduplication used
to indicate plurality are given in Table 4.13.

The first two of these four examples are reduplicated according to a pattern common for
Wambaya and described in §2.3.6. The second two examples have reduplicated forms which
are unpredictable according to the Wambaya patterns of reduplication.
The other two examples of nominal reduplication involve the noun labarnga `branch' (IV),
which is pronounced by some people as labarlabarnga, but appears to have the same meaningNominais107in either its reduplicated or its unreduplicated form, and garrgalyi `plains lizard' (I) which is
given as garrgaligaltii in Text 7 in Appendix A. Perhaps the reduplication in this last
example is for the purposes of emphasis.
4.6 DEMONSTRATIVES
Wambaya has a two-way system of demonstratives roughly comparable to this and that in
English. Like all nominal modifiers, demonstratives must agree with the noun that they
modify in terms of gender, number and case, thereby making the number of possible
demonstrative forms substantial. The two demonstratives each distinguish the four nominal
genders, three numbers (singular, dual, plural), and at least four cases (nominative,
accusative, ergative/locative and dative)42 although, as with most nominals, the nominative
and accusative case forms are homophonous. There are also a couple of examples of plural
demonstratives in the comitative case which are discussed later in the section. I have no
examples of demonstratives in either the allative or ablative cases. In the attempts to elicit
such demonstratives, locational nominals were used instead (as in `I'm going to (the) tree
there' instead of `I'm going to that tree'). There are also possessive demonstratives which
agree in gender with the possessed noun. These are discussed later in the section.
It was said in the discussion of nominal case above that nominals have only one case
suffix which marks both the ergative and locative case functions (see §4.4.3). This appears to
be the case for demonstratives as well, although I have only one example of the same form
being used for both ergative and locative case functions:
(4-226) Ngankagunyani irri-ng-a

ngaji-ni.
marala
feel.good 3SG.S-FUT heart.IV(NOM) see-LOC
She will be happy to see (her). (lit. Her heart will feel good seeing (her).)
(iii) Free Pronouns
Free pronouns form a small, closed class. They are referred to as 'free' to differentiate
them from the 'bound' pronouns that form part of the auxiliary (discussed below). Free
pronouns distinguish person (first, second and third), number (singular, dual and plural) and.
make an inclusive/exclusive distinction in the first person non-singular. There are no third
person singular subject or object pronouns; demonstratives are used instead.
Free pronouns have a different system of case marking from nouns and adjectives. While
nouns and adjectives have an ergative/absolutive system of case marking, free pronouns have
a nominative/accusative declension with nominative and ergative case forms being
homophonous- Free pronouns also have an oblique form which is used in the dative case and
as the base for the addition of other case suffixes such as the comitative. In the case of nonsingular pronouns, this oblique form is homophonous with the accusative case form.aIt is interesting to consider the possible relationship between the verbs and their corresponding adjectives.
The final jbi of the adjective gurijbi (and also bagijbi) is identical to a final sequence that in Wambaya is
quite distinctively verbal. There are many verbs that have this form: ngajbi 'see', gajbi 'eat', nyagajbi 'be
tired', and it is also found in verbs derived from adjectives with the inchoative suffix jbi: yarduga
'strong' (Iv) becomes varduga jbi 'become strong' (see §6.2.2.1). This suggests that the adjective gurijbi
may be derived from the verb gurijbi, thereby accounting for its verb-like form. This theory is supported
by the other gender forms of the adjective which are all based on this (verbal) form. The usual case
among adjectives is for the Class iv form to he identical to the root, and therefore to serve as the base for
the derivation of the other gender forms (see §4.2.2). However with gurijbi it is the Class I form (which
is identical to the verbal form) from which the other forms are derived. This is shown most clearly by the
Class II form gurijbi-rna in which the Class Ii gender suffix is simply added on to the full Class I form.
The situation with bagijbi is different in at least two respects. Firstly, there is some variation among
speakers as to whether the Class I form of the adjective is correctly pronounced bagijbi or bagiji. For
some speakers either form is possible, for others only the latter is possible as the Class I form of the
adjective. And secondly, the other gender forms are not derived from the Class I (and verbal) form, as is
the case with gurijbi, but are clearly all derived (quite regularly) from a common root bagig - :
Class I
bagiji/(bagijbi)
Class 11 bagi-nga
Class III baging-ma
Class Iv bagi-ga
The verbal form bagijbi is clearly also derived from this root.
The next question is why, if the Class I form of the adjective is actually bagiji, it is often pronounced
bagijbi, which is the verbal form? It seems quite probable that this could have happened on analogy with
gurijbi, particularly as it is quite common in fast speech for both gurijbi and bagijbi to he pronounced
guriji and bagiji respectively (even for the verbal form).",[67]
"As with all zero suffixes, the nominative zero case suffix is usually not included in the
example sentences in this work. Its presence, however, is signalled by its interlinear gloss
given in parentheses. Thus, baba `brother.I(NOM)' represents baba-0 `brother.I-NOM'.
4.4.2 ACCUSATIVE CASE
The accusative case marks transitive object. It is always marked with a zero suffix. Some
examples are:
(4-65) Ngajbî ng-a
lunggaji-0
gulug-barda.
see
1SG.A-PST policeman.I-ACC sleep-INF
I saw the policeman sleeping.
(4-66) Waliyulu î rr-a
marrgulu-0.
find
3PL.A-PST egg.IV-ACC
They found (some) eggs.
As with the nominative case suffix, the accusative case suffix is not usually included in the
example sentences in this work, but is represented in the interlinear glosses in parentheses.
Thus, marrgulu `egg.IV(ACC)' represents marrgulu-0 `egg.IV-ACC'.
4.4.3 ERGATIVE/LOCATIVE/INSTRUMENTAL CASE
There is one case that covers all of the ergative, locative an d instrumental functions. This
case suffix is consistently glossed `LOC' and is referred to in discussion as the `ergative/
locative' case. `LOC' has been chosen to gloss this case suffix as the locative function seems
more semantically basic: extensions of locative to instrumental (e.g. in Pitjantjatjara (Blake
1977:44)) and of instrumental to ergative (e.g. in Kune (Nick Evans, pers. comm.)) are
widely attested, but it seems more unlikely that an ergative suffix would have been extended
to cover locative functions 25 Although there is formally just one case, the ergative, locative
and instrumental functions can be distinguished from each other on functional and syntactic
grounds. This is discussed in more detail below.26
25Note, however, that this is purely speculative. Further investigation is required in order to substantiate
this claim for Wambaya.
26 The Jaminjungan languages also have one case morpheme which covers all three of ergative, locative and
instrumental functions (Hoddinott and Kofod 1976:397). In Ngaliwuru and Jaminjung the basic form is
the same as in Wambaya: -ni. In Nungali, in which the situation is a little more complicated, the most
common ergative/locative case markers are either the prefix nyi- or the suffix -ni (Hoddinott and Kofod
1976:397).
Wagaya, a language spoken immediately to the south-east of Wambaya, also has one form which is used
for ergative, instrumental and locative cases (Breen 1976:340), although this suffix (-1. -g or -dy) is veryNominais83The following examples demonstrate the use of the one ergative/locative case marker in all
three case functions:

a) Form
The ergative/locative suffix has 4 allomorphs with -ni being the basic, general form. Of the
other three allomorphs one is phonologically conditioned (-nu) and two are morphologically
conditioned, occurring in very restricted environments.
The allomorph -nu follows u-final stems. Its occurrence is optional in this environment; it
is equally as acceptable to use the regular form -ni:

The ergative/locative suffix -ji is found only after the dual suffix. There does not seem to
be any phonological motivation for the irregular form of this suffix. Examples include (4-67)
to (4-69) above, and the following:

different in form from the Wambaya suffix. And in Warumungu (spoken immediately to the south of
Wambaya) the ergative case marks instrumental and locative functions (Heath and Simpson 1982:20).
However, as Jane Simpson points out (pers.comm.), the coalescence in these languages is probably due
to a collapse of forms rather than the development of one case marker out of another: in Warumungu,
complete vowel assimilation causes the collapse of ngka 'LOC' and -ngki, -ngku 'ERG'; and in Wakaya,
the neutralisation of the case distinction was brought about by final vowel loss.
Chadwick (1976:393) suggests that in an earlier stage of the West Barkly languages, nouns may not have
been marked for ergative function and that the modern ergative (/locative) case suffixes may have
developed from a gender marker of a third person element in the noun phrase. The fact that -ni is also a
common Class I non-absolutive gender suffix in Wambaya may lend some support to this theory, as
does the fact that both Jingili (Chadwick 1975:16-17) and Nungali (Bolt, Hoddinott and Kofod 197I b:6869) have portmanteau forms that mark both gender and case. While Wamhaya makes a distinction in the
gender suffixes between absolutive case and non-absolutive case, in Wambaya, unlike in Jingili and
Nungali, it is necessary also to affix a separate case suffix to these gender suffixes.","[100, 101]"
"54Chapter 3processes in Wambaya. While these functions all have close associations with semantic roles,
the semantic roles are not necessarily invariant; a particular grammatical function may have
one semantic role with one verb, and a different semantic role with another. The role of
grammatical functions, therefore, is to provide the link between the surface morphological
and/or syntactic structure and the semantic level at which lexical predicates select arguments
with specific semantic roles (Bresnan 1982:288).
Distinctions can be made within the grammatical functions according to two main
parameters: whether or not the function is subcategorisable by a verb, and whether the
function is semantically restricted, or semantically unrestricted.12 The criterion of subcategorisability separates adjuncts from other types of grammatical relations. Adjuncts are
never subcategorised for and can potentially occur with any verb. Adjuncts are semantically
transparent in that an adjunct's meaning is consistent and predictable and is not affected by
the verb with which it may occur.
Among the subcategorisable functions, namely subject, object, indirect object and
complements, a distinction can be made according to whether or not the function is
semantically restricted (i.e. is only ever linked to an argument having a particular semantic
role) or semantically unrestricted (i.e. can be linked to any type of argument) (Bresnan
1982:293-294). Thus we can distinguish core functions (subject, object, indirect object) from
complements on this basis.13 Core functions are always subcategorisable and are
semantically unrestricted in that their meaning (i.e. their semantic role) is dependent upon the
verb of which they are an argument. Thus, the subject of one verb may have the semantic role
of agent, but that of another may be a perceiver or an undergoer. Similarly semantic roles
such as patient, perceived entity and location may all be paired with the grammatical function
of object subcategorised for by different verbs. Complements on the other hand, although
subcategorisable,14 are more closely linked with specific semantic roles and have a consistent
and predictable way of contributing to the meaning of the sentence (Andrews 1985:92).
Complements, therefore, form the middle ground so to speak, between semantically
transparent and non-subcategorisable adjuncts on the one end and semantically nontransparent and subcategorisable core functions on the other.
Some examples and a brief discussion of the types of complements and adjuncts found in
Wambaya follow. As the core functions are always subcategorised for, and are directly
related to, the verb of which they are an argument, they are discussed in §7.2, which deals
with the syntax of simple verbal clauses, and verb argument structures.
Complements have invariant meanings which are related to, and easily characterised in
terms of, their case marking. Yet, unlike adjuncts, they can combine with only certain verbs,
and would therefore be part of a full dictionary entry for their governing verb. A verb such as
12 This terminology and the system of classification of grammatical relations is taken from Bresnan
(1982:287).
13 Note that I use the term `indirect object' to refer to a type of object that is marked with an oblique case
(usually dative). This is in contrast to what I simply refer to as `objects', which are marked with
accusative case. Bresnan (1982) does not make such a distinction; in Bresnan's classification, these are
both a type of object.
14 Note that there is a slight difference here in the use of the word `subcategorisable'. The subcategorisability of complements is different from that of core functions in that core functions are
generally obligatory (i.e. a transitive verb has an obligatory subject and object) while complements are
more often optional (i.e. a verb of motion can have an optional ablative or allative complement
indicating the source or the direction of the motion).","[71, 72]"

4.3.3.4 -RDARRA `GROUP'
As well as marking plural number, -rdarra expresses a notion of collectiveness and is
usually best translated into English with the phrases `all of' or `a/the group of'. This suffix
has just one allomorph which occurs with nominals of all genders. It is found only with
nouns and adjectives, and is suffixed to the full citation form of the nominal, following the
absolutive gender suffix. Unfortunately, all of the examples that I have of this suffix are in
either the nominative or the accusative case so it is not possible to tell whether case marking
follows or precedes -rdarra. For the purposes of this work I will assume that case marking
follows -rdarra, as it does with all other number suffixes.","[96, 97]"
"4.9 NP STRUCTURE
A Wambaya noun phrase consists of a head and one or more modifiers, all of which are
optional (the head can be ellipsed when it is recoverable from previous discourse; see below).
All members of the NP must agree in terms of gender, number and case (where
morphologically possible). As is common to several Australian languages, elements of NPs in
Wambaya need not be contiguous in the clause. This possibility of discontinuous NP
constituents has led researchers working on some Australian languages (e.g. Heath 1986 on
Nunggubuyu, Blake 1983 on Kalkatungu) to suggest that these languages may not have NPNominals131constituents, and that apparent NPS can just be treated as apposed nominals. I will not review
the arguments for this analysis here, but assume that the following two pieces of evidence
argue for the existence of a NP constituent in Wambaya, at least in those cases in which the
elements are contiguous (see below for more discussion of discontinuous NPs):
(i) Usually the auxiliary must follow the initial word of a clause. However, it is possible
for the auxiliary to follow a complex NP, thereby providing evidence for its existence
as a constituent_ The position of the auxiliary can then be described as being after the
initial constituent of a clause.
(ii) In possessive phrases in which the possessor is marked with either genitive or dative
case, relational case marking is found only on the head of the NP. As relational case
marking is not found on the possessor nominal in this situation, the case marking
found on the head nominal also refers to the modifying nominal, thereby providing
evidence that the two nominals in such phrases form a single NP constituent.
The structure of a Wambaya NP is as follows.78 Note that any one of the modifers listed in
the position before the head can be postposed to follow the head.79
(MODIFIERS)(HEAD) (MODIFIER)(Dem)(POSS)(Num)(Adj) Nom
Dem = Demonstrative
POSS = Possessive pronoun or demonstrative, or possessive NPNum = Numeral
Adj = Adjective
Nom = Nominal
The head is usually filled by a noun, but can in principle be any type of nominal. An
example from Text 1 in Appendix A in which a numeral functions as the head is:
(4-301) Garnguji=mijiin-i-nmirra.many.I(NOM~INFER 3PL.S(NP)-PROG sitThere must be a big group (of people).
The fact that this example occurs at the beginning of the text (i.e. the second line) before
there has been any mention of people, suggests that the numeral is functioning as the head,
rather than simply modifying an ellipsed head. However, there are a small number of
examples in which it may be argued that the head has been ellipsed. Consider the following
sequence (lines 62-64) from the same text:S0787980This is the same structure as in Kayardild (Evans 1995a) and is very similar to the Gooniyandi structure
(McGregor 19%).
In his detailed discussion of Gooniyandi noun phrases, McGregor (1990) makes a distinction between
reference modification and referent modification, and shows that this distinction correlates with a contrast
in function between pre-head and post-head modifiers. Thus, an element which precedes the head modifies
the reference of the head nominal, it selects a subset of the potential referents denoted by the nominal. In
contrast. a post-head constituent modifies the head's referent, indicating a quality of property of the thing
itself, which may be independent of the nominal denoting the entity (p. 26711). Further research is needed
to determine whether there is likewise a semantic difference between pre- and post- head modifiers in
Wambaya.
This discussion has benefited greatly from McGregor's (1990) discussion of NPs in Gooniyandi,132Chapter4daguma juwarramba.

In this example, in contrast to that given in (4-301), garnguji in the final line appears to be
modifying the ellipsed head juwarramba which is mentioned in the preceding two clauses.
Thus, this is one example in which an NP has no overt constituent corresponding to its head.
A NP can also be made up of a pronoun. A (non-possessive) pronoun is always the head
of a phrase, and usually occurs alone (although see below for some possible exceptions to
this).

If a transitive subject NP is fronted it does not have ergative/locative case marking, but
appears in the nominative case. That the NP has been fronted in the following examples is
shown not only by the absence of case marking, but also by the position of the auxiliary,
which is in third, rather than second position in the clause (see §5.4 for a discussion of the
position of the auxiliary in the clause). Unfortunately, due to an absence of relevant
examples, it is not known whether other case-marked NPs also lose their case marking when
fronted, or whether this is simply a property of the ergative/locative case. Further
investigation is required.

The dative case is used in a large variety of functions. It marks the indirect object of
intransitive, semitransitive and some ditransitive verbs; the object of derived nominal
predicates; purpose; beneficiary; and oblique NPs marked in English with prepositions such
as `about' and `until' (as in `they're fighting', `I'll leave it until tomorrow'). The dative
suffix can also be used to mark possession, although there is also a separate genitive suffixNominals87(see §4.4.10). A derive NP is never represented in the auxiliary. Thus, indirect objects of
semitransitive verbs are not represented:

a) Form
The major allomorph of the dative suffix is -nka. This can also be pronounced [raga], with
the initial nasal having assimilated to the place of articulation of the following velar stop.29
For the use of -nka see examples (4-96) and (4-97) above and (4-102) and following below.
The other two dative allomorphs are found only after the dual number suffix. Of these,
-ja is the most common and is clearly related to the irregular ergative/locative allomorph ji
that is also conditioned by the dual suffix: both of these irregular suffixes replace the initial
nasal or nasal + stop of the regular suffix with the palatal stop /j/. The other allomorph that
occurs with the dual suffix, -janka, appears to be a combination of -ja and the regular dative
allomorph -nka. Both -ja and -janka occur in free variation. Some examples of each
allomorph follow.

possessor.

The case of the possessive phrase is marked only on the head noun; case suffixes do not
attach to the dative suffix. While this is also the case in examples such as (4-119) above, it is
demonstrated more clearly when the possessive phrase is in a non-zero-marked case:

"46Parts of speech and other preliminaries473.1.1 INFLECTING WORD CLASSES
3.1.1.1 NOMINALS
(i) and (ii) Nouns and Adjectives
For the most part, adjectives and nouns in Wambaya can be considered the same. In this
respect, Wambaya is typical of Australian languages, in which there is generally little formal
distinction between nouns and adjectives (Dixon 1980:272). Both nouns and adjectives are
inflected for case, number and gender, can function as the head of a noun phrase or as a
modifier qualifying the head; and can function as the predicate of a verbless clause (see §7.1).
However, there are differences between nouns and adjectives that support the treatment of
them as two different subclasses even though they are both contained within the larger
superordinate class of nominals. These differences are semantic, morphological and
syntactic.
Semantically, nouns typically denote objects and entities while adjectives typically denote
attributes. Furthermore, while nouns inherently belong to only one gender (or at most two, in
the case of some animate and plant nouns), an adjective has no inherent gender, but
potentially can be marked for any of the four genders in agreement with the noun that it
modifies (or in the case of an adjective functioning as the head of the phrase, in agreement
with the referent). For example:
bugayî
alaji
bugayirna bayigina
buguwama jigama
buguwa
darranggubig boy (I)
big bag (II)
big yam (III)
big stick (IV)Morphologically, most of the inflectional suffixes are identical for both nouns and
adjectives. However there is at least one difference, again concerning gender: while Class IV
(the neuter gender) is generally not marked on nouns, it is marked on some adjectives by
either -a, -ga or -ja:4
Nouns:
balamurru
wunba
barrawuspear (1V)
wind (IV)
house (1v)Adjectives:
gurijb-a
good-Iv
murrgun-ga three-IV
bagi-ga
bad-Iv
garngu-ja
many-IV
Note that this is simply a difference in the form of the marking, not in the number of
gender possibilities for nouns and adjectives, which is exactly the same.
The difference between the semantics of nouns and adjectives also leads to different
derivational possibilities. For example, the derivational suffix -mî, which can be attached to a
nominal X to derive a factitive verb with the meaning `cause to be X, make X' is found only4However with most adjectives, as with nouns, Class iv is not overtly marked (see §4.2.2).","[64, 65]"
"The ablative case suffix -nnga is used in prior clauses (examples (8-7), (8-8)) (the few
examples of this type of clause in the corpus all have co-referential subjects). These canDench and Evans (1988:30) argue that the use of what appears to be the locative case suffix to mark
same subject occurs only in languages in which this suffix also marks ergative case and can therefore be
seen to have arisen through a system of antecedant agreement with a main clause ergative subject, rather
than being related to a locative function. Thus initially it would have appeared only in subordinate
clauses controlled by main clause ergative subjects, and would then have extended to all subjectcontrolled subordinate clauses. While this may explain the development of this pattern of marking in
languages such as Wambaya, in which ergative and locative functions are marked with one case suffix, it
does not explain the use of the locative suffix to mark same subject in languages such as Jingili
(Chadwick 1975) and Bilinara (Nordlinger 1990), in which ergative case and locative case are marked with
separate suffixes.
In this chapter I will use square brackets to identify the subordinate clause.
An alternative analysis of these clauses with perception verbs is to treat them as object complements,
analogous to the subject complements of certain intransitive verbs discussed in §7.2.2.",[231]
"I SG.S-FUT this.ILPL.LOCI'll sit with these women.
There are no other examples of demonstratives occuring in locative NPs; locational
nominals are generally used instead. However, the above examples suggest that
demonstratives do not make a formal distinction between locative and ergative cases, so I will
therefore gloss ergative demonstratives as `LOC' on analogy with nominal case marking.
The forms of the demonstratives in Wambaya are given in Table 4.14. These are discussed
in detail in §4.6.1, following the table. The function of these demonstratives is discussed in
§4.6.2.
42Not all of the possible combinations are attested in the corpus. In fact. I have been able to get a complete
set of these different case forms only for Classes I and II. I have not been able to get ergative/locative or
dative forms of Class tit or Class tv demonstratives. The main reasons for these gaps are the infrequency
with which Class III or Class Iv nouns occur in either the ergative/locative or dative cases. and the
difficulty in forcing the demonstrative to be present on the rare occasions that these nouns do occur in
these cases. In the few examples in which I succeeded in forcing a Class iv demonstrative in a transitive
subject NP, the nominative form of the demonstrative was used:

demonstratives given in Chadwick (1978) for the other Eastern Group languages/dialects are
given following each set of Wambaya forms. As the nominative and accusative forms are
always homophonous in all languages, I have listed them together under the heading NOM/

mark both ergative and locative case functions (-ni), both Gudanji and Ngarnga have an alternative case
suffix that can also be used to mark locative case (-nbi). Ngarnga also has a separate instrumental case
suffix, -warndu, unlike the McArthur dialects, which use the ergative/locative case suffix in this function

"The transitive verb gudijbi `lose, forget' has an alternative case frame in which it occurs
with a nominative subject and a dative-marked verbal complement. In this case it means
`forget about, forget to':
10 This verb has a few different case frames and its meaning is a little difficult to characterise succinctly. It
can occur with a verbal complement as in example (7-50), and can also occur with a dative NP argument:

or with only a subject NP. In these examples it is usually translated as `feel weak, no good':

to something more like `he's no good' or `he's weak'.",[200]
"CHAPTER 4NOMINALS4.1 THE STRUCTURE OF THE NOMINAL WORD
The structure of the nominal word is:1
Root + (deriv) + (adnom) + (number) + gender# + ([GEN + gender*j) + (case)
deriv
= A derivational suffix (§4.5)
adnom = The proprietive suffix (§4.4.11), privative suffix (§4.4.12) or `origin'
suffix (§4.4.13)
GEN
= The genitive suffix (§4.4.10)
The only situation in which this slot is not obligatory is when the dual number
suffix is present.
*
This gender slot must agree with the gender of the possessed noun.
There are no examples in the corpus in which case marking follows the genitive suffix,
although such constructions are accepted by speakers as grammatical. There are also no
examples in which a derivational suffix is followed by an adnominal suffix, although it is
conceivably possible in a word such as ?yugu-warli-ngunya `cry-AGNT.I-PROP.II(NOM)'
meaning `(woman) having a crying (child)'.
Although there is not an example in which all of these slots are filled, the following few
examples attest to the above ordering and degree of complexity.
ROOT + ADNOM + NUMBER + GENDER + CASE:
(4-1) gijilulu-nguj-ball-nî-ni
money-PROP-PL-I-LOC
the men with money (ergative/locative)
ROOT + DERIV + NUMBER + GENDER + CASE:
(4-2) ngara-barli-marnda-nga-ni
drink-AGNT-PL-II-LOC
the women drunks (ergative/locative)
ROOT + GENDER + GEN + GENDER:
(4-3) bungma-nyi-niganka (maga)
old.man I GEN.IV
(camp.w(NOM))
the old man's (camp) (nominative)
Some of the adnominal and number suffixes are inconsistent as to the form of the nominal
that they take as their stem. While most suffixes are attached to the root of the nominal, there
are some examples in which such suffixes take the citation form of the nominal, including the
gender suffix, as their stem. For example the number suffix -rdarra `GROUP' (see §4.3.3.4)
always follows gender marking, unlike the other plural suffixes which must precede gender
marking (see examples (4-1) and (4-2) above):
This template does not represent the structure of demonstratives or pronouns. These nominal subtypes
are discussed in §4.6 and §4.8 respectively.","[75, 76]"
"APPENDIX BCOMPARATIVE DISCUSSION OF GENDER MARKING
In this section I will discuss gender marking in the other Mimdi languages/dialects, and
consider the ways in which it relates to gender marking in Wambaya (see §4.2.2 for a full
discussion of gender marking in Wambaya). The languages/dialects considered are Gudanji,
Binbinka, Ngarnga, Jingili (all information from Chadwick 1978) and Nungali (from Bolt,
Hoddinott and Kofod 1971 b). The other two Mimdi languages, Ngaliwuru and Jaminjung,
do not have a gender system.
There are a lot of similarities among the gender-marking systems of these languages, and
gender marking is one of the areas on which the genetic relationship between the West Barkly
languages and the Jaminjungan languages was initially established (e.g. Chadwick 1984:iii).
The gender affixes of each of the Mirndi languages that have a gender system are given in
Tables B 1 to B4.1 As the gender marking on nominals is essentially the same among the
dialects of the McArthur Language (Wambaya, Binbinka and Gudanji), I have included only
the list for Wambaya in the following tables. The only difference in gender marking among
these dialects is in the demonstratives, where Binbinka has slightly different prefixes. The
Binbinka demonstrative prefixes are included in Table Bl.
Note that gender is marked by prefix in Nungali, as opposed to the West Barkly
languages, in which it is marked by suffix (except in the Eastern Group demonstratives). A
further point to note is that both Jingili and Nungali have two sets of non-absolutive affixes:
one which is used in the ergative and/or locative case and one which is used in the dative
case. The other West Barkly languages, however, have only one non-absolutive form.","[275, 276]"
"Note that, although the transitive forms of the subject bound pronouns are used in these
constructions, a subject NP takes nominative case marking, rather than ergative/locative case
marking (as would usually be expected of a transitive subject; see §4.4.3). Thus, the

He stood among the grass.
4.4.8 COMITATIVE CASE
The comitative case expresses accompaniment and has two allomorphs: -yili, which is
used only with free pronouns and is discussed in §4.8, and -mbili, which is used with all
other types of nominal. The comitative case is used only with animate nouns (the proprietive
suffix (§4.4.11) expresses this meaning with inanimate nouns). Some examples are:
(4-141) Mirra ngi-ngujîga-mbîliirdîna-mbîli.sit

I'm sitting with my mother and father.",[110]
"126Chapter4person; the free object pronouns are therefore required to provide information as to the
number of the object (this is discussed in greater detail in §5.1).
Table 4.18 contains the non-possessive pronoun forms. The possessive pronouns are
given in Table 4.19 below. Note that the language does not have any third person singular
non-oblique pronouns; when necessary, demonstratives are used instead (this is quite
common in Australian languages; see Dixon (1980)). As ergative and nominative forms are
homophonous, I have listed them together in Table 4.18.

homophonous nominative, ergative and accusative forms, and a different form for oblique,
while the non-singular pronouns have one form that covers nominative and ergative cases and
another one that is used for both accusative and oblique.
The non-singular accusative/oblique forms are clearly derived from the non-singular
nominative/ergative forms. The non-singular nominative/ergative forms are made up of a
pronoun base followed by either -wani (after /u/) or -yani (after /i/). The accusative/oblique
forms are derived by replacing the final vowel of the pronoun base with /a/. Thus:

appear in the possessive pronouns; see below.

SoudanMAP 2: THE WEST BARKLY LANGUAGES[Locations are based on information contained in Chadwick (1978) and Avery (1990).]CHAPTER 1THE LANGUAGE AND ITS SPEAKERS1.1 THE LANGUAGE
Wambaya is a non-Pama-Nyungan language from the Barkly Tablelands region in the
northern central part of the Northern Territory. It belongs to the West Barkly language
family, which occupies an area of the central Northern Territory very roughly bounded by
Daly Waters in the north-west, Borroloola in the north-east, Brunette Downs Station in the
south-east and Renner Springs in the south-west (see Maps 1 and 2). The West Barkly
languages are part of a larger subgroup known as the Mirndi group which also contains the
Jaminjungan languages: Jaminjung, Ngaliwuru and Nungali. The location of these languages
is shown in Map 1.
Phonologically, Wambaya is fairly typical for an Australian language. The phoneme
inventory contains five places of articulation for stops (bilabial, alveolar, postalveolar, palatal
and velar), with a nasal corresponding to each stop articulation. Voicing is not phonemically
distinctive. There are three laterals corresponding to the three non-peripheral stop articulations
(alveolar, postalveolar and palatal), an alveolar tap/trill, three semivowels: /w/, Lr,,/ and /j/, and
three vowels: [i], [u] and [a], with no significant phonemic length distinction. In all of the
other West Barkly languages there is a sixth stop articulation, a dorso-palatal, described by
Chadwick (1978:9) as having an onset near the front of the velum and a palatalised release.
This stop does not occur in Wambaya and I have only ever heard one example of it in
Gudanji_ Wambaya words are mostly disyllabic or longer and, except for the auxiliary, never
end in a consonant.
There are seven parts of speech in Wambaya: nominals (including nouns, adjectives,
demonstratives, free pronouns and time and locational nominals), verbs, adverbs, the
auxiliary (including cross-referencing bound pronouns and tense/aspect/mood/directional
suffixes), particles, clitics and interjections.
Pronouns distinguish person (1st, 2nd and 3rd) and number (singular, dual and plural).
First person non-singular makes an inclusive/exclusive distinction, and a gender distinction is
made in the third person singular.
Wambaya nominals generally inflect for case, gender' and number. Although there are
three numbers — singular, dual and plural — only dual nouns are obligatorily marked for
number. All modifiers must agree with the noun that they modify in all of these categories.
There are four genders in Wambaya, marked by suffixes. In this respect Wambaya and the
other West Barkly languages are typologically aberrant, as gender in other non-PamaNyungan languages, along with much of the verbal morphology, is usually marked by
prefix.'- In fact, apart from the West Barkly languages, the only other non-Pama-NyunganI follow Corbett (1991:5) in using this term for what are more traditionally referred to as 'noun classes'.
2The Jarrakan languages also have genders marked solely by suffixes (Ian Green, pers.comm.).","[18, 19]"
"CHAPTER 7SYNTAX OF SIMPLE SENTENCESWambaya has two basic clause types (divided according to their predicators): verbal and
nominal (or verbless). A verbal clause has a finite verb as predicate and, except for under
certain discourse conditions (see §5.4), always requires the presence of the auxiliary.
Nominal clauses, on the other hand, have either nominal predicates or predicates consisting
of a purposive non-finite subordinate clause and cannot contain an auxiliary. A simple
sentence consists of a single clause of either type. I will begin with a discussion of verbless
clauses — those with nominal predicates — and will then discuss verbal clauses in §7.2. Nonfinite subordinate clauses are discussed in §8.1.
7.1 VERBLESS CLAUSES
For the purposes of this study I will assume verbless clauses to consist of a subject and a
(usually nominal) predicate.' Note that `subject' in this context, in which it is opposed to
`predicate', is used differently than in verbal clauses, in which it is opposed to `object'.
Verbless clauses do not contain an auxiliary, and therefore do not indicate tense. The tense
of these clauses is usually taken to be the same tense as the rest of the discourse or, if uttered
in isolation, present tense. If it is necessary for a verbless clause to be marked for past or
future tense, it can be made into a verbal clause with the use of mina `sit, be' and thereby
contain an auxiliary. The use of mina as a type of `copula' verb is discussed in §7.1.7.
As with other types of sentences, word order in verbless clauses is relatively free; the
subject can precede (example (7-1)) or follow (7-5) the predicate, or can be discontinuous (74). The subjects of these clauses are often modified (or represented) by a demonstrative that
can mark definiteness and therefore emphasise the subject. In all verbless clauses, the subject
must be in the nominative case. In ascriptive and having/lacking verbless clauses, the
predicate must also be in the nominative case and agree with the subject in both gender and
number.
7.1.1 ASCRIPTTVE CLAUSES
The predicate of an ascriptive clause attributes a certain property to the subject. The
predicate can be an adjective (examples (7-1) and (7-2)); a full noun phrase (7-3); a nominal
inflected with an adnominal suffix, such as the `origin' suffix (7-4); or a nominal derived
with the agentive or pri vative suffixes ((7-5) and (7-6)). Both subject and predicate must
agree in case (nominative), gender and number.","[190, 191]"
"Note that the genitive suffix is also usually not followed by case suffixes (see §4.4.10).
vii) Animate location
The dative suffix can be used to mark animate location or goal (although the allative suffix
is more commonly used with this function; see §4.4.5).

1DU.EXC.S(NP)-PROG there many.I-DAT

4.4.5 ALLATIVE CASE
The allative case indicates direction towards an object, person or destination. It has only
one allomorph: -nmanjî.30 Some examples are:

4.4.6 ABLATIVE CASE
The ablative case has two allomorphs: -ngani with directional and locational nominals, and
-nnga with all other nominals. The ablative case is used to indicate direction away from a
location or object.",[108]
"120 Chapter 4
much', `sometime, when' and `somehow, how'.60 There is a strong tendency for indefinite/
interrogatives to be initial in the clause.
As indicated by the term used, indefinite/interrogatives are found with two different
functions in the corpus: indefinite (4-249) and interrogative (4-250).61 In the former
function, they often co-occur with the enclitic -miji `INFER' (7.7.1.1).
(4-249) Gayina=mijiirr-adîdîma.

irr-a
didima.
something.IV(ACC) 3PL.A-PST tell
They told him something./What did they tell him?
Each of these examples expresses the fact that the speaker does not know what it was that
the subject told the object. As far as I can tell, the difference between the indefinite meaning
of example (4-249) and that of (4-250) is that in the former the speaker is indicating that
he/she is only inferring that anything was `told' at all. Such examples are often translated in
Aboriginal English using `must be', as in `I don't know what they told him, must be
something.'
I will now discuss each of these indefinite/interrogatives individually. A general
interrogative particle is discussed in §7.5.1.
4.7.1 GAY INI 'SOMEONE/SOMETHING, WHO/WHAT'
Like any other nominal modifier, this indefinite/interrogative is inflected to agree with its
referent in gender, case and number: when it is inflected with an animate gender suffix it is
translated `someone, who' and when it is inflected with an inanimate gender suffix it is
translated `something, what' or `which'. The forms found in the corpus are given in Table
4.17, followed by a discussion of the form and function of these indefinite/interrogatives,
and some examples of their use. As the nominative and accusative case forms are
homophonous, I have listed them together in the table.62

Thus, the case suffixes are regular for nominals: -0 `NOM and ACC', -ni `LOC', and -nka
`DAT', as are the gender suffixes: -0/-ni- `I ABS/NABS', -rna/-nga- `II ABS/NABS', -a `IV ABS60 For simplicity, in examples in this work I gloss each form according to the meaning it has in the
context in which it occurs.
61 Note that there are many other functions that indefinite/interrogatives commonly have in languages (see
for example Karcevski 1969, Wierzbicka 1980 and Mushin 1991, 1995); however these are the only two
functions that are found in my corpus for Wambaya.
62 The Class t ergative/locative form gayininini is often reduced to gayinini in fast or casual speech.","[137, 138]"

ninagawulija this.LDU.DAT
Other Demonstratives
There are two other types of demonstratives found in the corpus: demonstratives in the
comitative case and possessive demonstratives. As there are only a few examples of each
type, I have chosen to discuss them separately, instead of including them in the tables and
discussion above.
(i) Demonstratives in the comitative case:
In these examples, the regular comitative case suffix (-mbîli) replaces the ergative/locative
suffix in the ergative/locative form of the demonstrative. There are only two examples of this
type of demonstrative, both of which have plural number:
ngankagunyambi!i/ninkigunyimbili.
(4-228) Mirrang-ba ng-u
I
SG.S-FUT
this.II.PL.COMIT/thi s.LPL.COMIT
sit-FUT
I'm going to sit down with these women/men.
The fact that these demonstratives are based on the respective ergative/locative forms
suggests that what has been described as the ergative/locative stem may in fact be a more
general oblique stem. One argument against this, however, is the fact that it does not occur in
the dative forms.
(ii) Possessive demonstratives.
These demonstratives are made up of a non-absolutive gender prefix agreeing with the
possessor, the nominative/accusative demonstrative stem -na-, the possessive suffix -gan-5o
(this suffix is also found on possessive pronouns — see §4.8) and a gender suffix agreeing
with the possessed noun. Thus, these demonstratives agree in gender with both the possessor
and the possessed. In the remote forms, the remote suffix -yaga occurs after the gender
suffix. The only examples of these demonstratives are in the nominative case, and have both
singular possessor and singular possessee nouns. A lot more work is needed in order to
obtain all the other forms of these demonstratives. Table 4.16 contains the forms that are
present in the corpus:50 The fi nal nasal of this suffix is dropped before another apical nasal (such as in the Class It suffix -rna)
and assimilates to the place of articulation of a following palatal or velar stop.","[131, 132]"

possessive-deriving suffix -gan-, inflected for gender: ji/-nyi- `I ABS/NABS', -rna/-nga- `II
ABS/NABS', -ma 'III ABS' and -ga/-gi- Iv ABS/NABS'. The final nasal of the suffix -ganassimilates to the place of articulation of the following palatal or velar stop (i.e. with the Class
I and Class Iv suffixes), and is dropped before an alveolar or bilabial nasal (i.e. before the
Class II absolutive suffix and the Class III suffix).77
In Wambaya, as in many Australian languages, there is a contrast between two types of
possession: alienable possession and inalienable possession. The possessive constructions
discussed so far in this work, in the discussion of possessive demonstratives (§4.6.1), the
genitive suffix (§4.4.10) and the possessive use of the dative suffix (§4.4.4), have all
involved alienable possession; cases in which the possessed item is considered separate and
detachable from the possessor. The nature of inalienable possession, on the other hand, is
that of a part-whole relationship; the two entities are considered to be inseparable such that
what is happening to one nominal (the 'part') is conceived of as simultaneously happening to
the other nominal (the 'whole') (see, for example, Hale (1981), McGregor (1985), Chappell
and McGregor (1989), Chappell and McGregor, eds (1995) for a discussion of inalienable
possession in both Australian languages and more generally). The semantic contrast between
these two construction types is shown in the following English examples:
The dog bit me on the hand = The dog bit me (inalienable (or part—whole))
The dog ate my dinner
The dog ate me (alienable)
#
The dative and genitive suffixes and the possessive demonstratives can be used only in
constructions of alienable possession, which is also the most usual use of possessive
pronouns (see examples (4-292) to (4-295)). However, for purposes of emphasis (4-296) or
in verbless clauses (4-297), it is possible to use possessive pronouns in constructions of
inalienable possession.
Some examples of the use of possessive pronouns follow. For a discussion of inalienable
possession see §4.9.
77This suffix is also used to derive possessive demonstratives. However, in the one example of a Class III
possessive demonstrative in the corpus the alveolar nasal of the possessive-deriving suffix is retained
before the bilabial nasal of the Class III gender suffix: nganaganma `this.11.SG.POSS.111.NOM/ACC.
Simpson (1990) notes the similarity between the -ga accusative/oblique element in. Wambaya, and an
inversion marker in Warumungu -ngki or -ngku. As well as having a slight similarity of form, these two
morphemes are similar in occurring with non-singular accusative pronouns and possessive pronouns
(although whether the form that occurs with possessive pronouns in Wambaya is the same as that on
accusati ve/oblique pronouns is unclear, see the discussion in §4.6). However, the Warumungu morpheme
has an additional function of marking inversion of subject and object bound pronouns that the Wambaya
element does not have.",[147]

In other Australian languages such as Warlpiri (Simpson 1988, 1991) and Kayardild
(Evans 1995a), the verb in clauses such as these is marked with a derivational nominalising
suffix; thus non-finite subordinate clauses in these languages are clearly NPs. In Wambaya,
however, the category of these clauses is less clear. Like NPs, non-finite subordinate clauses
can be inflected with nominal case suffixes; and they can appear embedded within the main
clause (example (8-22)) or before the auxiliary (8-17) — two positions that are available to
NPs, but not to finite clauses. However, there is no nominalising suffix; the subordinating
suffix is attached directly to the verb stem. Furthermore, unlike other derived nominals, nonfinite subordinate clauses do not have to agree in case with the head noun that they modify
and nor are they marked for gender. The situation is made more complex by the fact that
different non-finite subordinate clauses have different characteristics. Simultaneous
subordinate clauses, for example, also differ from derived NPs in that they do not assign
dative case to their object NPs; and they cannot function as predicates in verbless clauses.
Purposive non-finite subordinate clauses, on the other hand, do have both of these
properties, and thus appear to be `more nominal' in their behaviour.) ""
8.1.1 SENTENTIAL CAUSATIVES
There are two examples of sentential causatives in the corpus. Both examples contain
purposive non-finite subordinate clauses.

locative case and the use of the comitative case.

the corpus:

"While there are other other verbs that occur with cognate objects (see §7.2.5.2), ngarlwi is
unique in that in clauses with the cognate object, the subject remains nominative and is
registered by an `intransitive subject' bound pronoun in the auxiliary. Other verbs taking
cognate objects, such as nijbi `sing (a song)' take ergative subjects which are registered by
`transitive subject' bound pronouns, when they occur in that case frame.
7.2.2.5 INTRANSITIVE VERBS IN NOUN + VERB IDIOMS
Two intransitive verbs belong to idioms in which they are combined with a nominative
noun which has an adverbial-type function. The two such noun + verb idioms found in the
corpus are:

"7.2 VERBAL CLAUSES: BASIC ARGUMENT STRUCTURES
In this section I discuss basic verbal clauses in terms of their main verb and the core
arguments that it subcategorises for: subject, (direct and second) object, indirect object and
subject complements. In §3.2 I outlined the criteria by which these different argument types
can be identified in Wambaya. Some aspects of this discussion, namely the distinctions
between the different types of objects,. are worth reviewing here.
(i) Direct objects are distinguished from second objects and indirect objects as they are
registered on the auxiliary with an object bound pronoun.
(ii) Second objects are found with a very small set of ditransitive verbs which also take a
direct object (see §7.2.1.5). Like direct objects, second objects are always marked with
accusative case and are thereby distinguished from indirect objects. Unlike direct
objects, second objects can never be registered in the auxiliary.
(iii) Indirect objects are not registered with an object bound pronoun in the auxiliary. Nor
are they marked with accusative case. In fact, indirect objects are almost always marked
with the dative case, the one exception being the allative indirect object of yardi 'put'.
Like other core functions, indirect objects are semantically unrestricted: their
interpretation depends on the verb with which they occur. Furthermore, unlike other
complements and adjuncts, some indirect objects can feed reflexive and/or reciprocal
As has been pointed out to me by Bill McGregor and Lesley Stirling (pers comm.). it is not surprising
that a verbless clause will have an objective meaning and a verbal clause a subjective meaning. In
verbless clauses the speaker is imputing a quality upon the subject (i.e. 'objective') and in verbal clauses
the speaker is describing a situation, event or state (such as that of 'feeling').",[197]
"134Chapter 4Another example involves the noun lagurra `hole'. Note that despite the fact that it belongs
to a different gender, lagurra shows no gender agreement with the head noun in this example:
(4-318) Yabu ng-aji
lagurra
juruma.
have 1SG.A-HAB.PST hole.IV(ACC) stomach.IIl(ACC)
I used to have a deep stomach (i.e. I was very thin).
In a couple of examples an oblique pronoun co-occurs with a noun. In these examples it is
difficult to determine whether the two belong to one NP or to different NPs. However, the fact
that pronouns usually occur alone in a NP, and that there is usually (but not always) a pause
between the pronoun and the noun, suggests that it may be better to treat these examples as
containing two apposed NPs, as in the English translations.
(4-319) Yandu irrî
ngaya
bulungunga-nka.

3PL.S(NP) 3SG.F.OBL young.woman.II-DAT

3PL.OBL-COMIT-ALL man.I-ALL
That menstruating woman can't go near them, the men.
However, in at least one example in the corpus, a pronoun appears between a modifier and
a noun, making the apposition analysis harder to justify:
(4-321) Jawaranya
ng-u
yidanyî ngaba ng-u
yardi

that.IV.SG.ACC cool drink this.I.SG.DAT 3SG.M.OBL boy.t-DAT
I'm going to get the billycan and put that cold drink (in it) for this boy.
Further investigation is required. In particular, it is necessary to test whether a pronoun +
noun combination can appear before the auxiliary before it can be determined whether they
can together make up a single NP.
INALIENABLE POSSESSION
As mentioned in §4.8, Wambaya makes a formal distinction between two types of
possessive constructions: alienable and inalienable. In constructions of alienable possession
the possessor is expressed by either a possessive pronoun or demonstrative, or by a nominal
inflected with either the dative or genitive case. In constructions of inalienable possession,
however, there is no special marking on the possessor nominal and the two nominals occur in
juxtaposition. Examples of constructions of alienable possession are found in §4.8. §4.6.
§4.4.4 and §4.4.10. A discussion of inalienable possession follows.
Constructions of inalienable possession are the most common type of what are commonly
referred to as part-whole constructions.81 These constructions are thus in contrast to those of
alienable possession, which encode two entities as being associated, but easily separable.
81Although, as pointed out by Chappell and McGregor (1989:28), constructions of inalienable possession
encode not so much a part-whole relation, but rather one in which two entities are seen to be inextricably
linked. See also Hale (1981). McGregor (1985) and Chappell and McGregor, eds (1995) for a discussion
of inalienability and part—whole relations in other languages.","[151, 152]"
"94 Chapter 4
A special form of the genitive suffix occurs with kinship nouns: -njî (I), -ma (II), -nja (1V).
Note that the Class I and Class II forms are identical to the final segment of the regular suffix
demonstrated above, while the Class Iv form is a little different: -nja rather than
-nîganka. Examples include:
(4-152) babana-nya
jajilînya

janji.

The genitive suffix found with kinship nouns differs from the regular genitive suffix in
that it is followed by additional case marking, in agreement with the noun it modifies:
(4-154) Gujinga-nyi-nijanyi-ni
dog.I-LOC
Mother's dog bit me.
M,II-GEN.I-LOCgini-ng-a
3SG.M-10-PSTdawu.
bite4.4.11 PROPRIETIVE SUFFIX
The proprietive suffix is used to indicate that one noun `has' another. Its use in Wambaya
is rather restricted and, although it is occasionally used to indicate alienable possession (as in
`I have a spear'), it is most frequently used to indicate the physical characteristics of a person
(e.g. `She is pregnant'), an object (e.g. `tea with milk') or a place (e.g. `place with trees').
a) Form
The proprietive suffix agrees in gender with the noun that it modifies:
(4-155) alajîdarranggu-ngujiboy.I(NOM) stick-PROP.I(NOM)a boy with (a) stick
(4-156) alanga
darranggu-ngunya
girl.II(NOM) stick-PROP.II(NOM)
a girl with (a) stick
(4-157) magadarranggu-ngujacamp.IV(NOM) tree-PROP.IV(NOM)
a camp with treesThe absolutive and non-absolutive forms for each gender are given in Table 4.10. The
gender marking with the proprietive suffix is regular for nominals (see §4.2.2) and the
different gender forms are all derivable from the root -nguj-. A noun with the proprietive
suffix must also agree with the case (example (4-158)) and number (4-159) of the noun or
referent that it modifies.","[111, 112]"
"This is the only situation in which there is a mismatch between transitive subject bound
pronouns and ergative/locative case marking. In all other types of constructions, a NP
represented by a transitive subject bound pronoun must have ergative/locative case marking.
While indirect objects of verbs such as ayanî `look (for)' and yandu `wait (for)' are not
cross-referenced in the auxiliary with ordinary object bound pronouns (see example (5-3)
above), they can be cross-referenced by the reflexive/reciprocal pronoun.
(5-26)Ayani ngurlu-ngg-a.
look.for IDU.EXC.A-RR-NF
We're looking for each other.",[160]
"3.2.2 DEFINING SUBJECT, OBJECT AND INDIRECT OBJECT
Following are the properties by which subjects, objects and indirect objects can be
characterised and identified in Wambaya.
SUBJECT I7(i)Subject NPs take either the ergative case (A) or the nominative case (S).(ii)In a main verbal clause or a finite subordinate clause, the subject is represented by a
bound pronoun in the first position in the auxiliary.(iii)In a non-finite subordinate clause the subject is the pivot and is obligatorily omitted,
being identical to a core argument of the main clause (see §8.1).(iv)In a simultaneous non-finite subordinate clause in which the verb is inflected with the
nominal suffix -nî, the main-clause subject is that which is co-referential with the
(omitted) subordinate-clause subject.(v)In a reduced adjoined clause the subject is the pivot and is omitted, being coreferential with the subject of the preceding clause (see §8.2).1816 I have not tested the limits of these combinations. For example, what is the limit on the number of noncore functions that can occur within a clause? And is it possible to have the complete set of dative
functions within the one clause? Consider, for example, 'I talked to the woman (indirect object) about
language (complement) for money (adjunct)'.
17 Note that this discussion does not help to identify or define the properties of a subject in a verbless
clause. There are often difficulties with formally identifying the subject in such clauses (e.g. see Morphy
(1983) on Djapu). Verbless clauses are discussed in §7.I.
18 In a non-reduced adjoined clause, the subject can be identified from the auxiliary by (ii).",[74]
"7.1.4 POSSESSIVE CLAUSES
Possessive clauses have a subject that is the possessee, and a possessor predicate that
contains either a nominal inflected with the dative or genitive case (example (7-21)) or a
possessive pronoun (7-22).
(7-21)Bungmanya-nkat-naganka yaniyagawarnu.old.woman.II-DAT/-GEN.IV that.IV.SG.NOM tobacco.IV(NOM)That tobacco belongs to the old woman.

this.IV.SG.NOM I SG.POSS.IV(NOM)
This (money) is mine!",[194]
"24 I don't know why this NP is in the accusative case rather than the dative case, as would be expected. One
possibility is that it actually means something more like 'he looked around the cooking site', however
this is not how it was translated to me.",[256]
"4.7.4 YANGULANY- `SOME AMOUNT, HOW MANY' 71
Yangulany- `some amount, how many' agrees in gender with the noun that it modifies.
The different gender forms are yangulanjî (I), yangulanya (II), yangulanyma an) and
yangulanja (IV). There are only a few examples of this indefinite/interrogative in the corpus. It
is likely that further examples will show that it also agrees with the head noun in case, but the
only examples I have so far are in the accusative case.72

"54 So called as they are characterised by a stem of the form -gt- (I) or -ga (u, Iv).
55 There are no Class t❑ forms in the corpus and no other case forms apart from ergative/locative,
nominative and accusative. As the latter two case forms are homophonous I have listed them together.
56 I was unable to obtain ergative/locative singular forms; a regular ergative/locative demonstrative was
always used instead.",[135]
"Although these indirect objects are not cross-referenced with an object bound pronoun in
the auxiliary (example (7-73)), they can feed reflexive/reciprocal constructions, in which case
they are represented with the reflexive/reciprocal bound pronoun (7-74). This is one way in
which they can be distinguished from dative marked adjuncts (7-75) (see §3.2 for further
discussion).
(7-73)Ayanî ngîl*ngi-ny-a
nganga.
look.for ISG.S(PR)/1SG.A-20-NF 2SG.OBL

"Parts of speech and other preliminaries57OBJECT
(i) Object NPs take the accusative case.
(ii) First and second person objects are represented by a bound pronoun in the second
position in the auxiliary. ('Third person objects are not registered in the auxiliary; see
§5.2).
The main-clause object is that which is co-referential with the (omitted) subject of a
simultaneous non-finite subordinate clause in which the verb is inflected with the
infinitive suffix -barda (see §8.1).
Some ditransitive verbs subcategorise for two accusative objects, only one of which is
registered in the auxiliary (see §7.2). I thus make a distinction between direct objects, to
which the above three generalisations apply, and second objects, which are characterised by
(i), but not (ii) and (iii).
INDIRECT OBJECT
The evidence for indirect object is considerably weaker than that for subject and object.
Indirect objects are marked with the dative case and are never represented in the auxiliary and
are thereby distinguished from subjects and objects. Indirect objects can be distinguished
from dative adjuncts and complements in that they are subcategorisable and semantically
unrestricted, and are thereby core functions. In addition, unlike other complements and
adjuncts, some indirect objects can feed reflexive and/or reciprocal constructions, in which
case the indirect object argument is registered on the auxiliary with the reflexive/reciprocal
pronoun (see examples (3-29) and (3-30)). As shown in (3-31) to (3-34), this is not possible
for dative adjuncts.

"Austin (198 lb) shows switch-reference to be an areal feature in Australia; languages
which have some sort of switch-reference system are spoken in a continuous area, extending
from the Indian Ocean through to western Queensland (p.329). As Wambaya falls within this
area, it is therefore predictable that it would have some form of switch-reference. In fact the
switch-reference system in Wambaya is typical for languages of the area in that the
e gative/locative_ suffix is used to mark same subject, and there is no switch-reference in
purposive clauses. The switch-reference systems of surrounding languages such as Jingili,
Garrwa, Wagaya and Alyawarra also have these characteristics (Austin 1981b:326-328).
However, the Wambaya switch-reference system differs from those of these surrounding
languages in that the infinitive case suffix, rather than the allative case suffix, is used to mark
different subject.
As in the majority of examples above, the usual case is for the non-finite clause to follow
the main clause. However, it may also appear initially, preceding the auxiliary (examples (817), (8-18), see also (8-1) above), and may even appear embedded within the main clause
((8-19) to (8-22)). The only examples of this latter possibility is when the subordinate clause
contains only a verb;9 and in all these examples the subordinate clause is followed
immediately by the controlling NP in the main clause.1 ov(8-17)yarru.
