An alternative is to form a headless relative clause from
the stative verb having -t°’e- as its root in the meaning
'X
belongs to Y¥'; in this case the full form of the relevant personal pronoun must also be used, e.g.yé-s-t°o~wthat-which to-me belong
(stat.non-fin.)
‘that which belongs to me // mine'
As this second expression contains a verbal component,
by
substituting the past non-finite form we shall obtain the
equivalent for ‘that which belonged to me // mine
[Past]',
which is the only way of making tense relevant to the system
possessive pronouns in Abkhaz, e.g.

could argue that this be interpreted as an instance of the obligatory incorporation of the intransitive subject or transitive direct object concerned.
Abkhaz orthographic practice does
not, however,
permit such elements to be written as part of
their verbal complexes.
An interesting case of incorporation is seen in the choice
of expressions available for representing the notion of ‘singing'; Abkhaz employs the periphrasis
'to say the song',

All tenses
have a finite and a non-finite form (cf. 2.1.3.5.2).
The nonfinite forms of the tenses of column II differ from those of
their column I counterparts by the addition of final -z.
As
Abkhaz uses these non-finite forms to represent its subordinate
clauses,
these are the forms that appear when the speaker
chooses the indirect mode of speech~reporting.

The:
