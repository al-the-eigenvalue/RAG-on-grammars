"9.5Case markingA nominal expression (NP) takes a grammatical case in an utterance. Grammatical
cases such as nominative, accusative, dative, static locative, dynamic locative, source,9 Grammatical structure327goal, instrument, and directional indicate the grammatical relation that a noun has visa-vis its predicate, another noun (in genitive, comitative, and connective cases), a
clause (in multiple nominative constructions), or a discourse (in the vocative case).
Cases are marked by case particles, which may often be omitted in various discourse
contexts. Nominative, accusative, dative, static locative, goal, and genitive particlesare frequently omitted in sentences, especially in colloquial speech, because these
cases are most easily predictable from the syntactic structure, word order, and the
nature of the predicate used. Thus, for instance, in Mia enni hak.kyo ka-ss-ta ‘Mia’solder sister went to school’, Mia is still in the genitive case, enni in the nominative
case, and hak.kyo in the goal case, despite their not being marked by any particle.
Cases may be divided into two groups: (1) those that mainly indicate syntactic
functionsof nominals,complement),accusativesuchas nominative(usually(usuallyfunctioningasfunctioningobject),andas subject
genitiveand(usuallyfunctioning as possessive), and (ii) those that mainly express semantic functions of
nominals such as dative, goal, locative, source, directional, instrument, and function.","[342, 343]"
"A nominalized clause is different from a relativeclause in that it does not have a head noun but only a nominalizer suffix (NOM) and
from a conjunctive or complement clause in that it functions as a grammatical case
suchas nominative,accusative,dative,locative,genitive,etc.",[335]
"For instance, in Alan.i ka hak.kyo eyse w-ass-e ‘Alan came from school’, Alan plays
the grammatical function of the subject of the sentence, whereas hak.kyo, marked by
the source particle eyse ‘from’, has the semantic function of indicating the location
from which Alan came. This dichotomy, however, does not preclude syntactic caseparticles from having some semantic functions as well and vice versa.
Among the particle slots of a noun phrase, nominative, accusative, and genitive
particles occupy the last slot, whereas the semantic particles occur in an inner slot
even before the delimiter slots, as in na man i (I only NM)‘only I’ (subject), nehanthey man ul (you to only AC) ‘only to you’ (object), and ape-nim kkey man uy
cinci (father-HT to only GN meal) ‘the meal only to father’ (genitive).
9.5.1Syntactic cases: nominative, accusative, and genitiveNominative,accusative,andgenitivecases,whichmaybetermedsyntactic(orstructural) cases in Korean fulfil the most productive grammatical functions. Since
they are, by and large, predictable from context, case particles are frequently omittedin colloquial speech if no emphasis, deference, or exclusiveness is intended. These
three particles (ka/i, (ul, and uy) cannot cooccur with a delimiter denoting topicality
such as (n)Jun ‘as for’, (i)ya ‘as only for’, and fo ‘also’ because all of them occupy the
last position in a noun phrase.",[343]
"Which one of a sequence of case particles becomes privileged depends on the
argument structure (or thematic roles) of the predicate. For instance, the copula ita
requires a theme subject, hence the nominative case in yeki eyse puthe ka must be
privileged in (136a). Similarly, in (136b), the predicate ponayta‘send’ requires adirectional role, hence the directional case in Kim sensayng eykey lo manul isprivileged. Dependence on the argument structure of a predicate can be more clearly
observed by comparing the two sentences in (137).
(137)a.tong-ccokulomanul —ka-ss-ta.east-side
DR only AC’
go-PST-DC
‘(He) went only to the east side.’
b.tong-ccokulomanylpo-ass-ta.east-sideDRonlyAC — see-PST-DC‘(He) looked only toward the east side.’In a sequence of cases which are equally case-relatable to the predicate, the last
one acquires priority in case privilege hierarchy over the preceding ones. Thus, in Kim
sensayng-nim eykey lo, both eykey ‘to/at’ and /o ‘towards’ can be relatable to ponayta9 Grammatical structure345‘send’, but /o is regarded as privileged and eykey is interpreted as a static human
locative ‘at’. As noticed in this example, there is a slight semantic difference in
certain semantic case particles between when the particle is used as a privileged one
and when it is used as a privative one. In a privative case, a goal particle (kkey, eykey,
ey) in a privileged case loses its goal meaning and functions as a static locative, and
the directional particle (uj/o also loses its directional meaning ‘toward’ and denotes a
general direction, as in hak.kyo lo puthe w-ass-ta ‘(He) came from the direction of
school.’ The ablative puthe means ‘from’ in a privileged case as in hak.kyo lo puthe
w-ass-ta, but ‘starting from, beginning with’ in a privative case as in (136a),
9.6Delimiter constructionsWhile case particles mark syntactic relations amongmajor constituents, delimiterparticles delimit the meaning of the cooccurring element with little syntactic function.
Many case particles including the nominative ka/i, accusative (J)ul, ablative puthe, anddirectional (ujlo behave like delimiters with their own semantic content, especially
when they become privative case particles as observed in 9.5.8. Delimiters appearmost productively in noun phrases but also with adverbs, complement clauses, and
even main sentences. Due to their syntactic and semantic properties, delimiters can be
classified into two types, constituent and sentential (or discoursal) delimiters, the
former occurring in noun phrases (including nominalized clauses) and with adverbs
and complement clauses, and the latter occurring at the end of a sentence and/or after
any major constituent.

In (136a), three case particles occur in sequence. While the locative and ablative
cases, marked respectively by eyse ‘at, in’ and puthe ‘from’, are inert in that they are
not associated with the predicate (the copula in this case), only the nominative case,344The Korean languagemarked by the particle ka, is related to the copula as its subject. The two inert caseparticles simply contribute their semantic content to the subject noun phrase. In this
respect they are like delimiters. In contrast to such inert cases, the case which
maintains its syntactic relation with the predicate may be called the ‘privileged’ case.
Thus, in (136a) the nominative case is the privileged case, while the locative and
ablative case particles are privative.
In (136b), the three case particles eykey, lo, and ul are flanked by a delimiter (man
‘only’). Here, the directional /o is the privileged case and is related to the predicateponayta ‘send’, whereas the particle eykey ‘to’ and the accusative particle u/ become
privative andfunction as delimiters. In (136c), the source particle eyse and theconnective particles wa ‘and’ and na ‘or’ all function as privileged, in that the former
is related to the predicate and the latter two connect two noun phrases.","[359, 360]"
"As shown in the above examples, Korean reflexives occur in the direct or indirectobject position, copular complement position, and possessive and other case positions.
Unlike in English, Korean reflexives may also occur as the subject of an embedded
clause as in (240a) and (241a). In such cases, Korean reflexives usually correspond toEnglish personal pronouns. For more on anaphoric phenomena in Korean, see W.C.M.

"9 Grammatical structure9.2.8293Word orderAs an SOV language, Korean has the basic and neutral word order of subject, object,
and verb/adjective. This order holds in both main and embedded clauses. Due to the
basic SOV order, all modifiers including determiners, genitive constructions, relativeand complement clauses, and conjunctive clauses precede their head elements. Case
and delimiter particles always follow the nominals they are associated with, These
orders are fixed and do not allow any variation. Amongnoun phrases that carryvarious cases, however, there seems to be a preferred or neutral word order. Roughly,
the order in (49) appears to obtain. Note that case markers are optionally or
obligatorily deleted in certain syntactic collocations.

"9.3Syntactic relationsSyntactic relations among various constituents in simplex and complex sentences may
be observed in terms of the overall syntactic structure. The relations between an
embedded clause and its head are expressed by various clause enders, each of which
consists of one or more inflectional suffixes, and certain connective particles (e.g.,quotative particle ko), while the relations among nominals or between a nominal andits clause-mate predicate (verb or adjective) are represented by particles that carry
various case functions (e¢.g., nominative, accusative, dative, locative, ablative, source,goal, instrument, and directional). Clause embedding will be discussed in 9.4, and
case relations in 9.5. The syntactic structure of Korean may be represented in terms of
traditional grammatical categories as in the following set of constituent structure rules.
These rules are not exhaustive, but they do cover most of the essential constituents of
Korean sentences.",[313]
"Notice that semantic case particles such as comitative and dynamic locative in this
example are intact, cooccurring with uy. Only the other syntactic case particles
(nominative and accusative) are obligatorily omitted before the genitive uy, hence
*Mikwuk i uy and *Mikwuk ul uy are ungrammatical.
Whena nominalin the genitive case contains case or delimiter particles, thegenitive particle also must occur. Thus, in Sewul lo puthe uy phyenci (Seoul DR from
GN) ‘a letter from Seoul’, uy must occur. Similarly, when a noun phrase in the
genitive case consists of conjoined nominals as in ne wa na uy chai-cem ‘differences
between you and me’ or a clause with a sentence ender as in cwuk-nu-nya sa-nu-nya
uy cencayng ‘a war of whether to live or die’, uy cannot be deleted.",[349]

"8.1Word categories8.1.1ClassificationThe Korean lexicon becomes richer, due not only to extensive borrowings but also to
productive coinages of new words through derivational processes such as affixation,
compounding, abbreviation, and contraction. In addition, Korean predicates (verbs
and adjectives) conjugate productively by means of a wide variety of inflectionalsuffixes.
In order to examine the word structure and word-formational processes in Korean,it is essential to determine what kinds of significant lexical-functional categories of
words are to be recognized. Linguists disagree on this issue. H.P. Choy (1971)
proposes ten categories, North Korean grammar books eight, and some others more orless. For instance, Choy (ibid.:198) establishes ten categories based on form, function,
and meaning: noun, pronoun, numeral, verb, adjective, copula, determiner, adverb,
interjection, and particle. To Choy’s scheme, W. Huh (1984:193) adds the category of
conjunctor which includes fossilized compounds such as kuliko ‘and’, kulena ‘but’,
and kulemulo ‘therefore’, which are assigned to the category of adverb in Choy. On
the other hand, North Korean grammars (e.g., Kwahak.wen1960) establish eightcategories: noun, numeral, pronoun, verb, adjective, article, adverb, and interjection.
In H.M. Sohn (1994), seven categories are proposed: noun, pronoun, verb, adjective,204The Korean languagedeterminer, adverb, and particle. It is common practice among Korean linguists and
lexicographers to set up an independent numeral category, and so in this volume, the
followingeightcategoriesandtheirsubcategoriesareestablishedbasedonmorphosyntactic and semantic properties.

"22The Korean languageIn the same vein, many linguists have argued for the Japanese relationship to the
Altaic, notably Boller (1857), Prohle (1916-17), Ramstedt (1924), Murayama (1962,1974), Miller (1971), Street and Miller (1975), Street (1978), and Starostin (1991).
Thus, the Altaic origin of Korean and Japanese is a generally accepted hypothesis,
although the hypothesis must be further refined and verified, In terms of the number
of seeming cognates, it is safe to say that, among the Altaic groups, Manchu-Tungus
is the closest to Korean, followed by Mongolian and then Turkish, It must be noted,
however, that there are scholars such as Haguenauer (1956), P. Kim (1960), H. Kwon(1962), Kawamoto (1974), and Kiyose (1986) who are sceptical about the affinity.
Many typologically shared features have been cited to relate Korean to Altaic (e.g.,
Fujioka 1908; Ogura 1935; K.M. Lee 1976). Although typological relationships helpsupport genetic relationships especially when exclusively shared among the languages
beingcompared,theyaregenerallyconsideredofsecondaryimportanceincomparative work. Some salient typological features are as follows.
Korean, Japanese, and Altaic languages manifest striking syntactic similarities.
The basic word-order common to them is Subject-Object-Verb (SOV). Conformingto the general tendencies of SOV languages, modifiers such as adjectives, adverbs,
and conjunctive, relative, and complement clauses precede the elements they modify,
while postpositions occur in place of prepositions. In all of these languages, the
singular and plural forms of nouns are not strictly distinguished; articles and
conjunctions are not developed; no affix exists in adjectives to express the
comparative or superlative degree; relative pronouns do not exist; the endings
indicating sentence-types such as declarative, interrogative, propositive, and
imperative are placed at the end of the sentence; and sentences may consist only of apredicate, with the subject and other cases contextually or situationally understood.
Further, possession is expressed by an existential predicate in these languages. For the
syntactic parallelism regarding grammatical cases, see J. Sohn 1973.","[37, 38]"

the nominative case, as illustrated in halmeni ka os i somay ka han ccok i kkuth iccic.eci-sy-ess-e.yo ‘The end of one sleeve of my grandma’s clothes is torn.’
The honorific particle kkeyse is used to mark the subject, including the sentential
subject of a multiple-topic construction. It has derived from the honorific source
kkeyse (e.g., apeci kkeyse pat-un ton ‘the money that I got from father’) and cannot be
used to mark a complement, as in ape-nim kkeyse kyocang i(/*kkeyse) toy-sy-ess-e‘My father became a principal’, nor to mark an object of a transitive adjective, as in

The nominative particle ka/i and the deferential kkeyse are frequently used to
introduce new information as a topic or subject into a discourse, Furthermore, ka/i

khenyeng ‘far from doing or being, let alone’ that occurs after (n)un. From each set, at
most one member can occur within a noun phrase. Observe the following sentences

In addition to the phonological aspects discussed thus far, the Hankul literature of
the fifteenth century was the first and oldest data to show the comprehensive
grammatical system of Korean. Some of the salient morphological and syntacticproperties of this period are presented in the following.
The case system included the following case particles. Notice that the forms of
genitive,locative, accusative,andinstrumental—directionalparticles beganwithaYang or Yin vowel (marked by a slash). Occurrence of these forms was conditioned
by the final vowel of the preceding words in terms of vowel harmony. Contemporary
Korean forms are also given for comparison. C stands for a consonant and V a vowel.

a (plain, after C)a (plain, after C)ja (plain, after V)ja (plain, after V)Fifteenth century Korean had i (with a high tone as in ‘/) as the only nominativecase particle, lacking the present ka. Thus, the present-day Korean phrases namu-ka
‘tree’ (nominative) and so-ka ‘cow’ (nominative) were namo-j and sjo-j, respectively,
until ka was introduced in the sixteenth century. Notice that ij was written (and
pronounced) as a semivowel coda of the preceding vowel ending syllable. After the
vowel / or the semivowel j, the nominative particle did not appear, but its reflex was
indicated by a tonal difference, as in foli + -i + 1o-:/i ‘bridge’ (nominative). After a
consonant, i was used as a separate syllable, as in salom-i ‘person’ (nominative).
The nominative case particle ka, which is an allomorph (occurring after V) of /,
first appeared in the literature in 1572 (K.M. Lee 1976: 155) and has been used
productively since the seventeenth century. One can only speculate that it could have
been borrowed from Japanese nominative ga. This newly introduced particle has been
redundantly attached to the already nominative-marked na-j (< na + i) ‘I’ (plain
nominative), ca-j (< ce + i) ‘TY (humble nominative), and na-j (< na + 1) ‘you’ (plain
nominative), resulting in n€-ka, ce-ka, and ne-ka, respectively.","[65, 66]"

generateactual sentencesbased on the aboverules, a widevariety of morpho-syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic co-occurrence restrictions must be observed.
Rule (60a) states that a sentence in a discourse (DS) may optionally begin with one
or more discourse-sensitive sentential adverbials (ADV) such as exclamations, time or
place adverbials, address terms, and modal adverbials and end with one or moredelimiters (DEL)such as the polite particle yo, the apperceptive particle kulye‘indeed’, the sentence-final plural particle tu/, and the conjunctive particle man(un)
‘but’. Utterances like aiko tahaynghi ipen ey nun Yongho ka sihem ey hapkyekhay-sssup-ni-ta yo! ‘Oh, fortunately Yongho passed the exam this time’ illustrate Rule (60a).
The first expansion of Rule (60b) accounts for multiple nominative constructionsas well as conjunctive sentence structure in Korean. It indicates that a sentence (S)
may take one or more hierarchical noun phrases (NP) and/or one or more conjunctive
clauses (S-CNJ) before the main clause (S). The recursiveness of topic nominals

kuliko‘and’,kulehciman‘however’,ohilye‘rather’,tekwuna‘moreover’,tolie‘rather’, and ttalase ‘accordingly’.
Finally, discoursal adverbs are so termed not only because they occur outside the
boundary of a sentence but also because they are conditioned by discourse contexts or
speech situations. They usually occur alone, or precede a sentence, as in a yes/noresponse, a term of address, or an interjection. Adverbs of yes/no response include
onya ‘yes’ (plain), kulem ‘certainly’ (intimate), ung ‘yes’ (intimate), yey/ney ‘yes’
(polite), anifyjJo ‘no’ (polite), and ku/ay-yo ‘that’s right’ (polite). Adverbs of address
include ya (plain), yey (plain), jpwa (intimate), yepokey (familiar), yepo, yeposio
(blunt), yeposeyyo (polite), and yeposipsio (deferential) ‘hello’, and many nouns used
for addressing, such as appa ‘daddy!’ and papo-ya ‘idiot!’. Adverbs of interjection,
which denote speaker’s sensation, emotion, or wish, include aiko ‘oh!’, ani ‘goodheavens!’, ca ‘well!’, celen ‘o my!’, ceykilal ‘shucks!, damn it!’, emena ‘oh my!’, andikhu ‘gosh!’. For an extensive syntactic discussion of adverbs, see 9.12.
8.1.9ParticlesParticles are postpositional function words that either indicate the syntactic relation of
the cooccurring element with other constituents of the sentence, delimit the meaningof the element to which they are attached, or perform some other function such as8 Word structure213plurality, conjunction, quotation, or politeness. As postpositions, particles follow anominal (noun, pronoun, or numeral), a nominal phrase or nominalized clause, an
adverb or adverbialized clause, or a sentence.
There are some phonological grounds for particles to be equated with suffixes. No
phonological word boundary exists before a particle but only an affixal boundary, as
observed in os [ot] ‘clothes’ vs. os i [o.si] ‘clothes (subject)’, where i is a nominative
case particle. Notice that s in os is not changed to [t] before the particle i, unlike the
case in os an [o.tan] ‘inside of the clothes’ where s is changed to [t] before the word

Among the delimiters, the topic-contrast delimiter (nJun ‘as for, concerning’ has
been most extensively discussed in the literature since its use is the most widespread
and its meaning is not easy to determine. In particular, when it appears in the subject
position with a topic sense (roughly ‘as for’), its meaning can hardly be distinguished
from the neutral (i.c., not exclusive) meaning of the nominative case particle i/ka.

"I Introduction1.5.615Agglutinative morphologyKorean is called an ‘agglutinative’ language, in that a long chain of particles or
suffixeswithconstantformandmeaningmaybeattachedto nominals(nouns,pronouns, numerals, noun phrases, etc.) or predicate (verb or adjective) stems. In
yeca-tul man uy kolphu ‘the golf (played) by females only’, for instance, the plural
suffix -tul, the delimiter particle man ‘only’, and the genitive particle uy follow the
head noun yeca ‘female’. Similarly, in ka-si-ess-keyss-sup-ni-ta ‘(a respectable
person) may have gone’, the subject honorific suffix -si, the past tense suffix -ess, the
presumptive modal suffix -keyss, the addressee honorific suffix -sup, the indicative
mood suffix -ni, and the declarative suffix -ta@ occur in that order after the head verb
stem ka ‘go’. As observed in these examples, numerous Korean suffixes and particles
do not have counterparts in many non-agglutinative languages such as English and
Chinese. On the other hand, there are many particles and suffixes in Korean that do
correspond to independent words in other languages. For instance, many English
conjunctive words are equivalent to Korean conjunctive suffixes, as in ka-ko ‘go and’
and ka-myen ‘if (one) goes’ where -ko ‘and’ and -myen ‘if’ are conjunctive suffixes.","[30, 31]"
"The nominative case particle| i is added directly to the preceding noun if thenoun ends in a vowel, asin2 co+ | i= 2] coy. If the noun is a Chinesecharacter or character compound,| i is written separately, as in FLf |‘Confucius (nominative)’.
(d)In the semi-lingualsound=J/, there are two sound(syllable-initial position) and dark =varieties,light=[r][Il] (syllable-final position). Examples areoj $ yelum [je.cim] ‘fruit’ and & pul [pul] ‘fire’.

of various sounds in syllable-initial, -medial, and -final positions, with examples suchas -}7]| (A)wwkhey ‘unhusked rice’, :¥] :moy ‘mountain’, and ::mil ‘honey’.",[151]
"Pronouns:wuli-tul (we-PL) ‘we’ (plain)
ce-huy-tul (I-group-PL) ‘we’ (humble)
tangsin-tul ‘you’ (blunt)The words belonging to the categories of numerals, determiners, adverbs, and
particles do not inflect evenin plurality. Althoughku-tul ‘they’ consists of thedemonstrative determiner and the plural suffix, this ku functions as a third person
pronoun. Similarly, although the adverb construction ppalli tul ‘quickly’ is acceptable,the plural fu/ in this case is a particle (not a suffix) denoting the plurality of the
understood subject, as in ppalli tul o-sey-yo ‘Please come quickly, you all!’
In verbs and adjectives, on the other hand, there are scores of inflectional suffixes,Inflectional suffixes follow derivational ones in morphological constructions, as in
cap-hi-si-ess-sup-ni-ta ‘(a respectable person) was caught’, where cap-hi ‘be caught’
is the stem consisting of the transitive verb root cap- ‘catch’ and the passive
derivational suffix -Ai, and the rest are all inflectional suffixes: -si (subject honorific
SH), -ess (past/perfect PST), -sup (addressee honorific AH), -ni (indicative mood IN),
and -fa (declarative suffix DC).",[248]
"Inkkaykkus-i, h is further reduced to ZERO because it is not pronounceable after s. In
the same vein, cen-hye ‘totally’ may be viewed as having derived from the obsolete
ceh-ha ‘be total’ + conjunctive suffix -ye ‘and so’.
Fossilized suffixes like -o/-wu have tured verbs into adverbs, as in nem-wu (go
over-) ‘overly’, tol-o (turn-) ‘back’, and cac-wu (frequent-) ‘frequently’.
8.3.5Determiner derivationSome verbs and adjectives have been fossilized into determiners with the relativizer
(RL) suffix -(ujn. This suffix is basically an inflectional one, but functions as a
derivational suffix in the formation of determiners.

Nominalincase particlesbehave like inflectional suffixes, but they are regarded as words in this volume, as
they are more word-like than suffix-like. That is, they are frequently omittable,
loosely associated with nominals, and can occur after a clause as in [nwu ka ka-nunya] ka muncey i-ta ‘Who is going, that is the problem’ where the bold-faced
nominative case particle takes the whole preceding clause as its domain. Thus, caseparticles will be discussed in the chapter on syntax (9.5).
The only suffix which may be considered inflectional in nouns is the plural -fu/,
although it also functions as a defective noun (e.g., so, mal, kay, tul ‘cows, horses,
dogs, ete.’; 8.1.2) and a particle (see below; 8.1.9). As a suffix, as in haksayng-tul‘students’, it has various inflectional properties. It carries the grammatical meaning of
plurality, does not change the word category of the cooccurring noun, does not
contribute to word formation, is used productively after nouns and pronouns, and is of232The Korean language‘outer-formation’. For instance, in the noun no/-um-kkwun-tul ‘gamblers’, the verb
root nol ‘play’ and the derivational suffix -um (nominalizer) form a noun root nol-um
‘gambling’, to which another derivational suffix -kkwun‘person’is attached. Thesuffix -tul is attached to the whole noun no/l-um-kkwun. More examples follow,

"Korean also has a phrase structure rule of the form V' — NPV'(9.3) to accountfor multiple object constructions such as (42b). Notice that cwi ‘rat’ is not the objectof the verb caluta ‘cut’ because the thing that is cut is not the rat but its tail. Thus, cwi
may be regarded as the topic of the following verb phrase, and han mali is the topic ofthe rest of the verb phrase. These topics may be termed verb phrase objects since they
are in the accusative case.
Awidevariety of nominalconstructionsin sentencescanbe topicalizedassentential subjects. Whether a given topic sentence is acceptable or not depends by
and large on the relationship between the topic and the rest of the sentence. In general,the syntactic and semantic relations between a topic nominal and the following

"Indeed, the class of particles borders between a wordcategory and asuffixal category in its phonological and morphosyntactic behaviour. However, wewill follow tradition and give particles a separate word category status. One syntactic
reason in favour of treating them as words is that they occur not only after a nominal
but also after a verb, an adverb, a clause, or even a full-fledged sentence. In cwuk-nunya sa-nu-nya ka muncey ta ‘To die or live is the problem’, tul-e o-sey-yo tul ‘Come
in, you all’, and pi o-n-ta ko malhay-ss-ta ‘He said it was raining’, the nominative
particle ka, the plural particle tu/, and the quotative particle ko occur after a sentence.
Korean particles may be grouped into three types: (i) case particles, which markthe syntactic relation of a nominal element with its coocurring predicate or with
another nominal (as in genitive or connective constructions) or the discourse relation
of a nominal element (denoting the addressee) with a main sentence (as in vocativeconstructions);(ii) delimiters,whichdelimitthemeaningsof the cooccurringelements; and (iii) conjunctive particles, which conjoin two or more clauses. These
three types are illustrated in the sentence in (8).

Grammatical structureThischapter surveysthe syntactic andsemanticcharacteristicsof contemporarystandard Korean. The discussions proceed in the order of structural essentials (9.1),
sentence types (9.2), syntactic relations (9.3), embedded clauses (9.4), case marking
(9.5), delimiter constructions (9.6), numeral constructions (9.7), modality and tenseaspect (9.8), passive and causative constructions (9.9), complex predicate

phenomena (9.13), and honorifics and politeness strategies (9.14). For further
descriptive and theoretical studies, see the works cited in the appended bibliography.
9.1Structural essentialsKorean is predicate-final, sharing the typical properties of predicate-final languages,
such as Japanese, and very different from languages like English and Chinese. Thus,
the predicate (verb or adjective) expression always comes at the end of a clause,
whether the clause is a main (matrix) or embedded one.
Korean is also a head-final Janguage and so dependent elements usually precede
their heads. All modifiers, whether they are adjectives, adverbs, numerals, relative or
complementclauses,subordinateor coordinateclauses,determiners,or genitivedelimiter particles are all postpositional;titles followconstructions, must precede the element they modify.
Case,conjunctive,andnames; an ‘auxiliary’ predicate follows the ‘main’ predicate; tense-aspect and
modality elements follow the verbal stem in the form of inflectional suffixes; and
various sentence or clause types are expressed by a sentence or clause ender which is
suffixed to the predicate. The comparative expression takes the order: standard +comparative particle + degree adverb + adjective/adverb as in Mia pota te yeyppun/yeyppu-key ‘prettier than Mia’.
Likemanyother predicate-finallanguages,therearenoarticlesor relativepronouns, and there is no movement of a wh-element or inversion of any kind in
question sentences. Sentence (1) illustrates many of these structural characteristics.","[280, 281]"

S. ROMAINE, N.V.SMITH, N. VINCENTP.H.MATTHEWS,This series offers general accounts of the major language families of theworld. The books are intended for linguists from undergraduate level
upwards, but no special knowledge of the languages under consideration
is assumed.
This book provides a detailed survey of the Korean language, covering its
speakers, genetic affiliation, historical development, dialects, lexicon, writing
systems, sound patterns, word structure, and grammatical structure. It is
designed to be accessible to a wide readership, and provides a wealth of
data in a user-friendly format that does not presuppose an in-depth
knowledge of the latest linguistic theories. It will be used by generallinguists and Korean linguists who are interested in the typological
characteristics of the language from both synchronic and diachronic
perspectives, and by undergraduates and graduate students in thosedisciplines who seek a comprehensive introduction to the linguistics of
Korean, Likewise, advanced students of the Korean language and languageeducators will find it offers valuable insights into lexical, phonological,morphological and syntactic aspects of the language for their purposes.
Ho-Min Sohn is Professor of Korean Linguistics at the University of Hawaii
at Manoa and President of the Korean Language Education and ResearchCenter. He is a past president of both the American Association of
Teachers of Korean (1994-7) and of the International Circle of KoreanLinguistics (1979-81). He is presently the Project Director of an
international collaborative project developing Korean language textbooksand a dictionary of Korean grammar and usage. His numerous publicationsincludeA Ulithian Grammar (1973), Woleaian Reference Grammar (1975),
Linguistic Expeditions (1986), Korean Proficiency Guidelines (1992) and Korean:
Descriptive Grammar (1994).","[455, 456, 457, 458, 459, 460, 461, 462]"

Korean transitive verbs normally do not allow a subject to be an inanimate noun. In
writings such as literary works, however, nouns like pihayngki ‘airplane’, hwacay
‘fire’, hongswu ‘flood’, kanan ‘poverty’, and cencayng ‘war’ are often used as the
subject. Even then, such words carry a metaphorical sense of personification.
Another transitive type consists of verbs that occur with nominals in the
nominative, accusative, and source cases. This includes not only receiving verbs such
as pat.ta ‘receive’ and tang-hata ‘undergo’ but also certain passive verbs like cap-hita
‘be caught’ and palp-hita ‘be stepped on’. The agentive source particle is
eykey(se)/hanthey(se) for verbs of receiving as in (23a), but eykey/hanthey for passive
verbs as in (23b).",[295]
"The function case occurs in constructions like taysa lo(se) kunmuhata ‘work as an
ambassador’, mat ulo(-se) thayenata ‘be born eldest’, and ci/ /o(-se) na yang ulo(-se)na wuswuhata ‘be excellent in terms of both quality and quantity’.
9.5.4AblativeThe ablative case is marked by the particle puthe ‘from’ or particle compounds such
as (ujlo puthe (directional/instrumental + puthe) ‘from the direction of, starting from,
starting with’, eyse puthe (source or dynamic locative + puthe) ‘starting from the place
of,andkkeyse puthe(honorificsourceor dynamiclocative+ puthe)‘fromarespectable person’. The bare form puthe usually occurs with time nominals as in
nayil puthe ‘from tomorrow’ and akka puthe ‘from a while ago’. Directional,
instrumental, and source (dynamic locative) ablatives are illustrated respectively in
(127a, b, c).

somewhat similar to (63b), although it is not a case of initial consonant deletion in one
and the same morpheme: cha ka cha-ka ‘car (subject)’ vs. san i san-i ‘mountain
