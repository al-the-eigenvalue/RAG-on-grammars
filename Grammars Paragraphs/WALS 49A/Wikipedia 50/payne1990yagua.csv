"Syntax Of Phrase Types
15 Noun phrase structure
15.1 Marking for case. Noun phrases coding A and
roles (sect. 1) are
distinguished both by word order and by cross-referencing with Set I versus
Set II clitics. S arguments are marked in one of two ways. In the great
majority of cases they are treated like A arguments, both in terms of word
order possibilities and Set I clitic forms. Most intransitive movement verbs,
however, may take Set II clitic forms under certain discourse conditions. In
non-verbal clauses, the S argument may be referred to with a Set II clitic.
It cannot be referred to with a Set I clitic. Details of order and clitic use
are discussed in sects. 1, 9.1, and 16.
15.2 Genitives. The genitive phrase (possessor) normally precedes the head
noun (the possessed item):
(302)Tomäasa rooriy
Tom
house
Tom's house'If the identity of the possessor is presupposed, a Set I clitic may be used
instead of a full noun phrase:
(303)sa-rooriy
3SG-house
'his/her house'In certain contexts where the identity of the possessor is presupposed, it
may be referenced by both a Set I clitic and a noun phrase. The Set I
clitic is prefixed to the head noun and the possessor follows the possessed
item:
(304)sarooriy Tomäasa
Tom's house'There are no forms for indicating alienable versus inalienable, temporary
versus permanent, present versus past, or specific versus nonspecific
possession.","[99, 100]"
"17 Postpositional phrases
Yagua is a consistently postpositional language. There are upwards of thirty
postpositions and there are no prepositions. At first glance the direct object
(Set II) clitics might be considered prepositions since they always
immediately precede any coreferential full noun phrase. However, these
forms are very distinct from common conceptions of prepositions in several
respects. They only mark direct objects and never mark oblique roles. They
function as part of the participant reference system, alongside forms
referring to other persons and numbers. Hence they are functionally more
like pronouns than prepositions.
Postpositional phrases have one of three forms:
1) Noun Phrase Postposition
2) Proclitic-Postposition
3) Proclitic-Postposition Noun Phrase
One example of each of these types of postpositional phrase is illustrated
below:

Mamertu
MamertoBased partly on Powlison (1982), we distinguish two classes of
postpositions: 'concrete' postpositions which are semantically highly specific,
and 'general' postpositions which have a wider range of meaning and are
closer to being grammatical than lexical items. The second class consists of
the following forms:
(436)-jy
-siy
-va or -iva
-mu or -imu'adlative'
'ablative'
'dative'
'locative'(ADLAT)
(ABLAT)
(DAT)
(LOC)According to Powlison (1982), the adlative and ablative postpositions
indicate motion towards and motion away from the point of reference,
while the dative, locative, and other postpositions indicate a position at rest
relative to the point of reference. The adlative and ablative postpositions
can be suffixed to the dative -va/-iva, to the locative -mul-imu, or to any
'concrete' postposition. Certain verbs such as diiy 'see' and sytay 'say' are
subcategorized to take O's with the dative postposition. When suffixed to
nominalized ('subordinate') adverbial clauses, the locative and instrumental
are extended to indicate 'while', the dative indicates 'until', and the adlative
indicates 'purpose'. The ablative -siy does not (so far as we know) occur on
nominalized adverbial clauses; it does correspond to the verbal bounded
movement formative meaning 'action done upon departure' (sect. 18.2.3.2).
We present here a few examples of each of the general postpositions:
(437)

"18.7 Incorporation. Due to the highly polysynthetic nature of the Yagua
verb, a great number of modifications which are expressed by means of
adverbs in many other languages are expressed in Yagua by verbal suffixes
(e.g., the ideas conveyed by the location and movement suffixes).
Nevertheless, since these do not otherwise occur as non-bound forms we do
not consider them to be cases of adverb incorporation.
There is some evidence that object nouns can be incorporated into a
verb phrase when the verb phrase is nominalized. Incorporated object
nouns precede the verb rather than follow it. The opposite order cannot be
used in such nominalizations. However, the object nouns are not
phonologically bound to the verb word, as shown by retention of the j /h/
at the beginning of 'make' in (567).",[164]
"In addition to these forms there is a set of forms meaning 'which?' that
index the animacy and, if animate, the number of the participant
questioned:
(164)m»ra
munuurya
muvyerya
muryaraanimate singular
animate dual
animate plural
inanimateMost of these interrogative forms are multimorphemic, involving a muyand a -ra component, plus the animate or neutral classifiers (sect. 23).
Participants in any morphosyntactic role can be questioned. There is no
distinction between subject and object forms. Examples (165) and (166)
below question subject and object roles, respectively. (167) questions an
oblique. The postposition is fronted along with the questioned item. (168)
questions a semantically possessed item, and (169) questions a semantic
genitive. However, (168) and (169) are predicate nominal constructions and
the questioned element in both cases is the syntactic subject. Nevertheless,
(170) shows that the genitive noun within a noun phrase can be questioned
(it is presupposed that children are crying). When the genitive is
questioned, the entire possessed noun phrase occurs preverbally.

"Yagua 451Paul Powlison (personal communication) observes that at least some of the
roots with which va- occurs are classifiers; va- may be one means of
deriving a nominal from them, as in (685):
(685)väsoopajyuunu
va-soo-pay-juu-nu
VA-CLASS:fuzzy-matted-profuse-CLASS:ANIM:SG
'an animal with thick matted hair'However, classifiers themselves are nominalizers and many are also nouns
in their own right. With the data available to us at this time, we can
neither prove nor disprove the hypothesis that va- serves a nominalizing
function.
23.2.2 Suffixal morphology. In many languages information which modifies
or restricts the reference of nouns is primarily expressed by separate
adjectival words. The order of such descriptive modifiers relative to their
head nouns has become an important parameter in typological studies (cf.
Greenberg 1963, Hawkins 1983). An important typological feature of a
number of Native American languages, however, is the relatively infrequent
use of noun phrases in discourse, correlated with an even more infrequent
use of separate adjectival words. In Yagua, descriptive modifiers occur
within noun phrases frequently enough to demonstrate a 'neutral' order of
head and modifier (sect. 23.3.3; Doris Payne 1985b). Nevertheless, a great
deal of modifying information is expressed by suffixes on nouns, as in (685)
above.
Specific types of nominal suffixes include classifiers and suffixes
expressing condition, size and quantity. The following schemata, describing
the order of these suffixes, is modified from Powlison (1961):
(686)STEMCLASS""CONDITIONSIZEQUANTITYCLASS"" indicates that more than one classifier can occur on a given
noun. As noted in sect. 23.1, classifiers indicate something about the shape,
spatial orientation, function, consistency, or animacy/number of a noun.
Classifiers occur in a variety of morphosyntactic contexts, one of which is
as a derivational suffix on a noun itself. Co-occurrence of classifiers with
noun stems is lexically restricted, depending on the inherent semantics of
the items involved. Condition and size affixes are less restricted lexically.
Some condition suffixes are etymologically related to verb roots. Quantity
suffixes indicate duality, plurality, or profusion, such as -juu 'heap of or
'profuse' (note that animate classifiers also indicate three numbers).
Quantity suffixes include -suma 'very', which has an augmentative adverbial
meaning. The first three examples which follow are taken from Powlison
(1961):452 Payne and Payne(687)STEM

within the noun phrase: demonstratives (sect. 16.4), numerals (sect. 15.3.1),
genitives (sect. 15.2), descriptive modifiers (sect. 15.3.1), and relative clauses
(sect. 14.7).
23.3.1 Demonstratives. Demonstratives consist of a demonstrative root jiy
'this' or ru 'that (distant)', plus a classifier (see sect. 16.4 for examples). A
quantity suffix indicating the number of the item may follow this:
(693)runujuy
ru-nu-juy
DEM2-CLASS:ANIM-DL
'those two (animate)'(694)jinujuy
jiy-nu-juy
DEM1-CLASS:ANIM-DL
'these two (animate)'If no quantity suffix follows the classifier, singular reference is normally
implied.
23.3.2 Numerals. The well-developed numerical system of Yagua is
described in Powlison and Powlison (1958). It is a quaternary decimal
system in which the numerals 1 through 5 and 10 are unique. The numerals
6 through 9 are composed of the words for 1 through 4, plus the suffix
-nijataa On top of (Vainilla dialect). Numeral roots are infixed with
classifiers, sometimes with entire noun roots when there is no specific
classifier, or with the neutral classifier -ra. Idiosyncracies in the system are
discussed in Powlison and Powlison (1958) and in Doris Payne (1986a).
Sect. 15.3.1 discusses order of numerals within the noun phrase.
23.3.3 Descriptive modifiers. The class of inherently adjectival roots is
extremely small, perhaps limited to j^qmu 'big' and pasuy 'small'. Japuu
'small' may also be inherently adjectival. These roots can be suffixed with
classifiers to derive nominals. Except for a few cases, roots can be
classified as nominal, verbal, or adverbial, depending on what morphology
they take.
Despite the paucity of inherently adjectival roots, order of head noun
versus elements which modify the head can still be identified in a given
discourse context (this determination is based partly on referentiality or
subsequent discourse deployability of head elements; cf. sect. 15.3.1; Doris
Payne 1985b). Head + modifier is the neutral order. In one count of over454 Payne and Payne1000 clauses of narrative text material there were 28 instances of the order
head + modifier and 5 instances of the order modifier + head. Of the
latter five instances, two involved negation of the modifier, and one was an
instance of the modifier jaaryiy 'much, very' which always precedes its head,
both in its function of modifying nouns as well as in modifying verbs. The
two remaining cases involved the lexical item samirya 'good' and we leave
the ordering unaccounted for. On the basis of these text counts we
conclude that the use of non-bound descriptive modifiers within the noun
phrase is clearly infrequent, but that the preferred order in naturally
occurring text is head + modifier.
Inherently adjectival roots are always suffixed with classifiers when
following the head and may be suffixed when preceding the head. The
neutral classifier -ra is most frequently employed when the head noun is
overtly present in the same clause.
Verbal roots must be suffixed with classifiers or some other nominalizer
in order to serve as (phonologically separate) descriptive modifiers (sects.
15.4; 23.2). Certain roots which can modify either verbs (i.e., as adverbs) or
nouns (i.e., as adjectives) are apparently idiosyncratic with regard to
suffixation when they modify nouns. For example, samiy 'well, good, new,
clean' is sometimes suffixed and sometimes not. Compare the following two
examples:

"A preverbal subject noun phrase may not antecede a proclitic (unless that
noun phrase is set off from the verb by a distinct pause) as illustrated by
the ungrammatical sentence in (2a). A postverbal subject noun phrase, on
the other hand, must be co-referenced by a proclitic. Example (2b)
illustrates that if a postverbal subject noun phrase follows the verb without
a corresponding proclitic occurring on the verb, ungrammatically results:
(2a)* Manungo samur44y(2b)*mur44y ManungoType 1 clauses may be univalent, as in (1); divalent, as in (3), (4) and
(5); or trivalent, as in (6) and (7). If the clause has an Ï participant, a Set
II enclitic indicating animacy, and if animate, the person and number of the
O, often occurs. (There are a few two-participant verbs that require that
the Ï be in the dative case; these will not occur with a Set II clitic.) For
purposes of this sketch we will say that Set II enclitics precede ""roughly
definite"" direct objects (see sect 16.1.3 and T. Payne (1985) for further
discussion of the function of Set II enclitics). Set II forms function rightward
(i.e., they immediately precede any noun phrase with which they show
""agreement""). However, they always cliticize leftward, regardless of the
syntactic category of the host (see examples in 4). If no full noun phrase
referring to the object occurs, the enclitic is required. This could
alternatively be stated as follows: whenever an enclitic occurs, the following
NP may be omitted. When the NP is omitted, the Set II clitic most
neutrally occurs at the end of the clause. In the following examples, all
enclitics referring to objects are italicized in the morphological
representation:
(3a)siimyimi
sa-jimyiy-raT
3SGI-eat-3SGII
'He ate it (an animal).'",[6]
"342 Payne and PayneThis example illustrates that the superordinate proposition need not be
explicitly formulated (or even formulatable) in a single clause, much as the
English 'therefore' can refer to an entire stretch of discourse, (ramutee
might be analyzed as ra-mu-tee ºÍÁÍ-LOC-INTS,' and ramusiy as ra-mu-siy
ºÍÁÍ-LOC-ABLAT.' The inanimate proclitic would refer to the
superordinate proposition.)
14.7 Relative clauses
14.7.1 Structure of relative clauses. Consistent with a verb-initial type,
relative clauses in Yagua strictly follow their heads and are of the following
form:
(286)Head-NPRELATIVIZER
RELATIVE PRONOUN[s . . REF (R-NP) . . ]The abbreviation REF indicates a non-fully specified participant reference
form (usually a Set I or Set II clitic; see sect. 16) within the relative clause.
It normally occurs if a relativizer occurs, but not if a relative pronoun
occurs. R-NP indicates the noun phrase within the relative clause which is
normally omitted due to identity with the head. When R-NP is not omitted
the referring clitic (REF) necessarily precedes it (sect. 16).
Both the relativizer and relative pronouns are formed by suffixation of
-tiy to one of the following demonstrative or third person pronoun forms.
(We do not know whether first and second person forms could also be
used.)
(287)jirya (or contraction to ja)
jifiu
çßß
riy
r
çýý
tgthis (inanimate)
this (animate)
third singular
third plural
inanimate
other
someone, anyoneJiryatiy, or its contraction to jatiy (especially in the Cahocuma dialect), is
the most neutral form. It can be used with either animate or inanimate,
definite or non-definite heads. All other forms reflect semantic features of
the head and thus can be referred to as 'relative pronouns'. Relative
pronouns indicate case only for relative clauses formed on prepositional
phrases. In the following examples, the head noun (if present) and
resumptive reference form (REF) are italicized. The relative clause is
bracketed:Yagua 343(288)Tomääsa saayäsiy

"Anita
AnitaIn the Cahocuma dialect there is no such restriction on the use of the third
person enclitics and (17) above is acceptable.
Tense, aspect, and many other inflectional categories characteristic of
verbs cannot be expressed directly in predicate nominal or predicate
locative clauses. Instead, a verb of being or existence is used (cf. examples
80 and 81; sect. 5.2). In the remainder of this sketch, we will no longer
indicate the distinction between Set I and Set II clitics in the glosses.
1.2 Basic order of constituents in main clauses. In the preceding section
we claimed that the basic order of subject and object in all three clause
types is postpredicate. Here we briefly present evidence supporting this
claim (see Doris Payne 1985b, 1986b, and sect. 9 of this paper for fuller
discussion). In the following discussion, type 3 clauses (non-verbal
predications) are treated as intransitive clauses, with nominal predicates
being subsumed under the label 'V.
The order VOSu does not occur unless the Su is right-dislocated (as an
'afterthought'). Similarly, SuOV and OSuV occur only if one or both noun
phrases are left-dislocated (cf. sect. 9 and Doris Payne 1985b). None of
these orders ever occurs in dependent clauses. This leaves only VSuO,
SuVO, and OVSu as candidates for basic orders. A major argument for
positing VSuO as basic concerns the circumstances in which subject, object
and postpositional constituents occur before the verb. Any one, but only
one, such nominal constituent at a time can occur before the verb. This
points to the preverbal position as having a marked status. In fact, fronting
occurs in marked pragmatic contexts of focus of contrast, repetition, added
detail repetition, information questions and answers to information questions
(cf. sect. 9 and Doris Payne 1985b).
VSuO, VSu, and VO clauses, on the other hand, are used for
introduction and reintroduction of participants into the discourse, and for260 Payne and Payneclarification when the identity of participants may be confused. It might be
argued that introduction of participants into discourse is also a marked
communicative function. Thus the preverbal position should not be
identified as any more pragmatically marked than is the postverbal position.
It is possible, however, to introduce new information in preverbal position,
provided that one of the other pragmatically-marked conditions mentioned
above also holds. Thus, VSuO is a more neutral order relative to SuVO or
OVSu in that it is the unmarked case for introductions.
With regard to simplicity of description (and depending on one's
theoretical biases), positing VSuO as basic leads to overall simplicity in the
grammar. If we hypothesize that the basic order is SuVO, then two
statements are needed to describe the order variation OVSu. First, a
statement needs to be made regarding fronting of the object nominal and a
second regarding subsequent or simultaneous movement of the subject
nominal to a postverbal position. Positing VSuO as the basic order,
however, would entail just one statement in order to account for the OVSu,
SuVO, PVSu, and PVSuO variations (P = postpositional phrase).
Statistical evidence also favors positing VSuO as basic. The data given
here come from a study reported in Doris Payne (1985b), based on
approximately 1516 clauses. In this corpus of data, 8% (122) of the clauses
use a preverbal noun phrase or free pronoun to refer to the subject
participant. In 17% (257) of the clauses, the subject noun phrase follows
the verb. 75% of the clauses, then, use just proclitics to refer to the subject
participant.
There are 465 object references in the 1516 clauses. In 14% (65) of the
cases reference is made by object noun phrase preceding the verb, and in
40% (186) an object noun phrase follows the verb (and subject if present).
46% (214) of object participants are referred to just by means of an
enclitic.
These data show that it is much more likely for participants to be
referred to just by means of non-fully-specified Set I and Set II clitics, than
by noun phrases or free pronouns. In particular, only 25% of subject
participants and 54% of object participants in the corpus are referred to by
noun phrases or free pronouns. Nevertheless, when subject and/or object
noun phrases do occur, they are much more likely to appear in postverbal
position. In sum, VSuO is pragmatically the least marked and statistically
the most frequent order when full noun phrases are used.
1.3 Basic order in subordinate clauses. Subordinate clauses, that is, relative,
adverbial, and complement clauses of verbs like daatya 'know', fogta 'begin',
and jachipiypp 'think about', are infrequent in oral narrative discourse. We
have found no naturally-occurring examples which suggest that the basic
order of syntactic roles in subordinate clauses is different from that in mainYagua 261clauses. It is, in fact, rare to find subordinate clauses which consist of more
than a verb and a postpositional phrase. The examples found in sect. 14
are primarily elicited and thus determination of basic orders should not be
judged just by these. Nevertheless, subordinate clauses with more
constituents are grammatical, as the following relative and adverbial clauses
attest:

COR1-poison
(have) seen it, he who made the bushmasterj spill hisj poison.'","[11, 12, 13]"
"The alternation between the use of a Set I or Set II clitic for those verbs
that allow either is not correlated with an alternation in volitionality on the
part of the subject, as is the case in classic ""stative-active"" or ""fluid-S""
languages (Sapir 1917, Klimov 1977, Dixon 1979). Rather, use of S0 coding
is highly favored in discourse contexts where a major character is moved to
a new scene, or at points of episodic climax (see T. Payne 1985, ch. 6, for
more discussion). The suffixes -nuvee 'upon arrival at a new scene' and
-nuv# 'upon arrival at the currently activated scene' are consequently
common in this construction as their deictic nature is well suited to location
changing predications (cf. example (11)). The effect of these constructions
might be rendered fairly accurately by English presentatives such as 'up
jumped the rabbit,' or 'here comes my bus,' though their discourse
distributions are not necessarily equivalent.
S0 clauses are most commonly preceded by a locative demonstrative dify,
'there (near),' jasiy, 'there (yonder),' or muuy, 'there (distant).' Examples
(8) and (11) were judged ungrammatical without the initial locative.
However, as examples (9) and (10) show, S0 clauses clearly do occur
without them.
Type 3 clauses are predicate nominals and locatives. In these
constructions, the noun phrase serving as predicate normally occurs initially,
followed by the subject noun:258 Payne and Payne(13)maestum Antonio

"Yagua 36116 Pronoun system
In this section we discuss non-fully-specified reference forms, including free
pronouns and clitics. Sect. 4 discusses reflexivity, reciprocity and other kinds
of intrasentential coreference. Sect. 13 briefly discusses anaphora in
discourse.
16.1 Participant reference clitics. Subjects (the conjunction of S and A in
the sense of Silverstein 1976 and Dixon 1979), possessors, and objects of
postpositions can be referred to by what we term Set I clitics. These clitics
occur prefixed to verbs and auxiliaries (sect. 18.8), to nouns, and to
postpositions (sect. 16.1.2). Objects, whether 'direct' or 'indirect', are
referred to by Set II enclitics. In most cases the Set I and Set II clitics are
morphologically similar to the corresponding free pronouns, except for
stress and phonological binding. The Set I and Set II third person singular
clitics are completely distinct from each other. For all other persons and
numbers, the two sets of clitics differ only in tone. There are special Set I
and Set II clitics for indicating coreference (COR) with a previously
mentioned subject, possessor or object of postposition within the same
clause (subject to certain pragmatic constraints). Part of the function of the
Set II coreference clitic is to indicate reflexivity and reciprocity (sect. 4).
16.1.1 Set I clitics and subject reference. The basic Set I clitics are as
follows:

jiy-ra-The coreference (COR1) and inanimate (INAN) clitics are not distinguished
for number. In the Vainilla dialect the COR1 clitic can code any
person/number other than first and second person singular. In the
Cahocuma dialect it may code only third persons. Most of these forms have
allomorphic variants depending on the phonological shape of the stem to
which they are attached (see T. Payne 1984 for a detailed description of
these variants). The most common allomorphs are the following:

which they occur, which may be a verb, postposition, or head noun. When
they are prefixed to the verb they indicate subject reference, as in
examples (1) through (4) of sect. 1. When the preverbal auxiliaries g.
'irrealis', riy 'could'/'frustrative', niy 'malefactive' or y 'negative' (sect. 18.8)
occur in a clause, Set I forms are prefixed to the auxiliary rather than to
the semantically 'main' verb:

"Alternatively, a predicate nominal clause may reference its only
obligatory argument with a noun phrase plus a Set II clitic. Set II clitics are
normally associated with transitive objects but in this case they mark an S
argument. Set I clitics cannot occur:372 Payne and Payne(400)voocaachanii

"Yagua 333Although use of full noun phrases and free pronouns is avoided, true
zeros (i.e., where there is not even a Set I or II clitic referring to a
participant) are extremely infrequent. In one study of three texts comprising
approximately 290 clauses, there were only two cases of zero reference.
One of these is illustrated in example (245g) above where the verb does
not have any subject marked. The second occurs in the same text
approximately ten clauses later, when the bird gets his come-uppance:

"The sense of -taniy in this example is 'to allow' rather than strictly
causative. This example could be glossed 'The enemies allowed (someone)
to finish them off,' the 'someone' being an unspecified causee. 'The
enemies' cannot be the causee. That is, (389) cannot mean 'Theyj allowed
the enemies to finish themj off.'
16.2 Free pronouns. Subjects, objects and occasionally possessors and
obliques may be referred to with free pronouns. Free pronouns occur both370 Payne and Paynepreverbally and postverbally (see sect. 1). Some preverbal free pronouns
serve the pragmatic function of ""exclusive contrast"" (T. Payne 1987).
Postverbal free pronouns are extremely rare and their function has not yet
been determined. The forms of the free pronouns are the following:

riyThe coreference categories, COR1 and COR2, are not expressed by free
pronouns. The category 'inanimate' is expressed by demonstrative free
pronouns only (sect. 16.4).
The following examples show free pronouns in the subject role.

juväay
ray

"Yagua403Vanay always occurs preverbally. It is unlike the modal auxiliaries (a
'irrealis', riy 'frustrative'/'could', niy 'malefactive' and y 'negative') in that it
cannot be inflected for subject and does not take any clitics which
otherwise attach to the first element in the clause. (The negative nee may
also occur preverbally and never takes second-position or Set I clitics.)
18.4 Person, number and gender. Participant reference is treated in full in
sects. 4, 13, and 16. Set I clitics are generally attached to the verb or to an
auxiliary to make reference to the gender (animate or inanimate), and if
animate, the person and number of the subject participant (sect. 16). In
some pragmatically marked contexts the subject noun phrase is fronted
before the verb. A Set I clitic does not occur on the verb in this case
(sect. 9). When the object is roughly definite, a Set II clitic precedes it.
This enclitic phonologically attaches to whatever immediately precedes it.
Although in some cases this clitic may attach to the verb, it is not strictly a
verbal suffix (sects. 16.1.3 and 16.1.4). Oblique participants are not
referenced in the verb.
18.5 Transitivity (voice). The valence decreasing -y discussed in sect. 5 is
the only morphological means of forming a univalent (intransitive) verb
from a divalent (transitive) verb. (See, however, sect. 15.4 on Object
nominalizations', which derive nominal expressions referring to one
participant from divalent verbs.)
There are two productive valence increasing suffixes, -taniy 'causative'
(sect. 6) and -ta 'instrumental/comitative'. There are seven non-productive
suffixes which increase the valency of a verb and/or the degree of intensity
or activity of the action depicted by the verb. All these suffixes are termed
highly derivational formatives in the schemata given in (448).
The instrumental/comitative -ta 'INST' is identical in form to the
instrumental/comitative postposition. As a verbal suffix, -ta normally implies
that the direct object is to be interpreted as a semantic instrumental or
comitative. There are some roots, however, with which it does not impart
any obvious instrumental or comitative meaning to the direct object.
When -ta occurs in the verb, the semantic instrument or comitative is
formally treated as a direct object rather than as an oblique. Although
definitive discourse-based study waits to be done, coding of instruments as
direct objects is probably dependent on definiteness and topicality of the
instrument. Compare the use of -ta as a verbal suffix (534), versus its use
as a postposition (535).","[154, 155]"
"Example (538) would be more natural if one of the noun phrases occurred
preverbally. In this case, the preverbal noun phrase would not be
cross-referenced by a Set II clitic.",[156]
"2 Parataxis
Parataxis, or juxtaposition of phrases within a clause, occurs for elements in
subject, object, oblique, and adverbial roles. There is minimal parataxis of
verbs. Juxtaposed clauses can convey certain rhetorical relations such as
coordination, antithesis, comparison, and contrast (sects. 2.2, 7, 8, and 9).
2.1 Juxtaposition of phrases. We define phrasal parataxis as a case of two
(or more) non-conjoined references within the same clause which refer to
the same entity or manner, or which refer to conjoined entities but without
a coordinating conjunction. In He went there, to the house, both there and to
the house refer to the same location. However, there is no parataxis in a
sentence like The boy who stole the pears and the boy who broke down my
fence are the same person since the two phrases are conjoined rather than
juxtaposed. The definition as given needs further refinement since we wish
to rule out sajyuy Rospita 'Rospita falls' as being an instance of parataxis,
even though sa- and Rospita are non-conjoined references to the same
entity. Consequently, we amend the definition such that if single subject or
object noun phrases occur in their normal postverbal position
cross-referenced by Set I or Set II reference forms, they do not constitute
parataxis. If subject or object noun phrases occur postposed to peripheral
clause elements such as postpositional phrases or locative words, it may
constitute parataxis, provided there is some other reference in the clause to
the same entity.",[16]
"Certain clitics are not glossed, but simply appear in the gloss line in
capital letters. This convention reflects our continuing lack of knowledge:
any possible gloss we might give these forms would do more to obscure
than to illuminate their functions.
The following conventions are observed in presenting Yagua examples. 1)
Four lines of information appear with most examples: (a) a surface
phonemic representation, without morpheme divisions, (b) a morphemic
representation giving the underlying forms of all the morphemes and the
boundaries between them, (c) a morpheme-by-morpheme English gloss, and
(d) a free English translation. In the interest of saving space, the (a) line is
omitted when morphophonemic alteration of the underlying forms is
non-existent or minimal. 2) Morpheme boundaries in the Yagua morphemic
representation and the English glosses are indicated by hyphens (-). 3)
When more than one English word must be used to indicate the meaning
of a single Yagua morpheme, a colon (:) is inserted between the English
words. This convention does not imply a 'portmanteau morph' or anything
of the sort.
We would like to emphasize that the morpheme glosses do not represent
all-inclusive analyses of 'the meaning' of forms. Rather they are presented
as an aid to the non-Yagua speaker in understanding the examples. This is
particularly true with respect to the glossing of substantive roots; e.g., the
verb pyychiy is glossed 'lead/carry', even though this verb has many more
specific connotations—it conveys the idea of an adult transferring a child
from one location to another, either by picking the child up, leading
him/her by the hand or simply walking in front of him/her. Most formatives
have only one gloss, even though it is clear that they have more than one
function. Only in quite clear cases of homophony are two identical surface
forms given two distinct glosses. We have attempted, insofar as possible, to
gloss morphemes in such a way that the most general meanings are462 Payne and Paynerepresented in the glosses, e.g., 'proximity' seems to be the most general
concept that unites the tense and locational meanings of the TROX1' and
TROX2' morphemes.
The morphemic representation (the second line of data that occurs in
most examples) assumes that morphemes are isolatable 'chunks' of
phonological material corresponding in a direct way with chunks of
meaning. We recognize that this assumption cannot be made for all
languages, as Anderson (1982) demonstrates. There are situations even in
Yagua where this assumption breaks down. However, for the most part
Yagua morphology can be adequately and insightfully analyzed as consisting
of strings of meaningful formal units.","[213, 214]"
"Although it is possible to reference both objects with clitics, the preferred
form is to refer to one of the objects by means of a clitic and to use a
bare noun phrase with no accompanying clitic for the other. The object
referred to by the clitic comes finally in the clause, regardless of whether it
is the causee or patient. In ambiguous cases where both specific objects
have the same number, person, and gender, the preferred interpretation is
to take the Set II clitic as referring to the causee. In (103) and (104),
saquiivq Anita is a genitive constituent 'Anita's fish'. The clitic -yu is
construed as co-referential with a preceding argument which in these
clauses is Anita. Although this argument is a surface object, it still has the
ability to control coreference. This is due to its status as an ""initial"" Set I
argument of the predication of eating. In (103) -yu refers to the causee. In
(104) it refers to the patient.",[38]

3SG-inside alligator

following is commonly used to express the idea of 'in front of:
(371)samoomu
sa-moo-mu
3SG-face-LOC
'in front of him' (Lit: 'at his face')Hence, there is a historical connection between the use of Set I clitics on
both postpositions and nouns.
Nominal stems and postpositions fall into the same conjugational classes
as do verb stems. These classes largely depend on the phonological shape
of the initial syllable. For example, jytay 'say', ÀøéïïÜá 'mother', and jysiy
'after' conjugate identically for subject, possessor and object of postposition
respectively.

'your mother' yisiy'after'
'after me'
'after him'
'after you'As these examples show, there is sometimes considerable phonological
fusion between a Set I clitic and a following root (depending on the initial
syllable of the root). Such fusion is characteristic of affixes rather than
clitics. However, the syntactic behavior of the Set I forms parallels that of
what are called clitics in other languages (e.g., Romance clitics; cf. Bybee
1985:27, 42). In particular, the Set I forms do not occur if a coreferential
noun phrase precedes the verb, noun, or postposition. Thus, Set I forms
are not an Obligatory' part of the constituent as would be true of classic
inflectional agreement forms.
16.1.3 Set Ð clitics and object reference. Set II clitics are morphologically
similar to Set I clitics. Third person singular is the only category for which
completely different Set I and Set II forms exist. The coreference clitic jiy(COR1) in the Set I paradigm is roughly equivalent functionally to the
coreference clitic -y (COR2) in the Set II paradigm—they both normally
indicate coreference with some preceding subject, object or object of
postposition. Part of the function of -y is to indicate reflexivity and
reciprocity (see sect. 4.3). Some of the Set II forms are always
phonologically bound, while others normally occur as free forms. In fastYagua 365speech even the latter may undergo the phonological processes
(palatalization and vowel sandhi) characteristic of the bound forms. Those
which are always bound are indicated by a preceding dash. Those which
normally occur as free forms lack the dash:1

"Yagua 37716.8.2 Singular/plural. It is a general principle of Yagua discourse that one
avoids the use of fully-specified noun phrases as much as possible (sect. 1),
allowing the rich participant reference system to keep participants sorted
out. Only in marked contexts or to avoid ambiguity are fully-specified noun
phrases used. One strategy for avoiding the use of fully-specified noun
phrases is to treat one plural participant as singular when two groups are
interacting. In such cases, the most topical or in some sense 'salient' group
is treated properly in terms of its semantic plurality. The other group is
treated as singular. For example, if adults and children are interacting, the
adults will be referred to as plural and the children as singular. If humans
are interacting with animals, the humans will be plural and the animals
singular. If 'good guys' are interacting with 'bad guys', it is predictably the
'good guys' who are treated as plural while the 'bad guys' are treated as
singular:

1.4 Peripheral clause constituents. Obliques are phrases encoding time,
location, manner, participants, or props, which are not required by the
subcategorization or case frame of the verb. Obliques are encoded in
postpositional phrases, locative words, and clausal adverbs. Obliques most
neutrally occur postverbally. Postverbal obliques must follow any full NP
referring to the subject. Order relative to object arguments is discussed in
sect. 9. (Obliques are italicized in what follows.)

"These nominalizers derive historically from the singular animate classifier
nominalizers (sect. 15.4) plus the instrumental/comitative suffix -ta (sect.
18.5).
15.3 Modifiers
15.3.1 Basic order of constituents within the noun phrase. Noun phrase
modifiers include the categories of descriptive modifier, possessor, relative
clause, demonstrative, numeral and quantifier. Roughly 'definite' direct
object phrases are preceded by reference clitics (sect. 16.1.3), but otherwise
there are no articles. Noun class is indicated by classifiers which show
obligatory agreement between numerals and the head noun, and between
demonstratives and the head noun. Other nominal modifiers may also be
suffixed with classifiers, but this is not obligatory. Classifiers are discussed
at length in sect. 23.
The unmarked order of modifiers within the noun phrase is: Demonstrative - Numeral - Quantifier - Possessor - Head - Descriptive
Modifier - Relative Clause. Adverbials precede quantifiers and adjectives
that they modify (sect. 19). Descriptive modifiers are most commonly
syntactic nominals, either inherently so or as a result of derivational
processes. Examples of various complex noun phrases follow:

"278 Payne and Payneb. Impersonalization: The identity of the subject/agent of the
active clause is suppressed in the passive, by whatever means.
c. Detransitivization: The passive clause is semantically less
active, less transitive, more Stative than the active clause.
In what follows, we discuss three constructions which serve one or more of
the functions mentioned by Givon: a valence-decreasing -y formative,
predicate nominals in which the predicate consists of a nominal formed on
the understood patient of a divalent verb, and an impersonal construction.
Finally we illustrate lexically passive verb roots.
5.1 Valence-decreasing -y. The suffix -y occurs with some verb roots to
indicate a reduction in the number of inherent arguments associated with
that verb. All verbs which can take -y contain the semantic role of agent in
their case frames, but when -y is used, the agent participant cannot be
expressed. Consequently, the topic of the clause (viz., what the clause is
'about') cannot be taken as the agent, but is most likely taken as the
patient or experiencer. No participant other than the patient or experiencer
of the action can be expressed as subject of this construction. Compare the
following pairs with and without the -y formative (note the pitch difference
between (70) and (71)):

"13 Anaphora
In Yagua it is eminently clear that clitics are the primary means of
referring to participants in discourse; full noun phrases or free pronouns
are used rarely, and then only in highly restricted contexts. The basic formsYagua 331of the participant reference clitics are given in sect. 16, and are referred to
as Set I and Set II clitics (see also sect. 1). In discussing anaphora we will
first note the major contexts in which full noun phrases or free pronouns
are used (see T. Payne 1985 for a more detailed discussion of the use of
anaphoric devices in discourse). Against this background we will make a
few comments on how non-fully-specified forms are interpreted across
sentence boundaries (see sects. 4, 16, Doris Payne 1985b, and T. Payne
1985 for discussions of co-reference within sentence boundaries).
Full noun phrases and free pronouns are employed in pragmatically
marked contexts (sect. 9). They also introduce new information and clarify
the referent when there is a sufficient degree of ambiguity (T. Payne 1985).
However, due to the well-developed Set I and II clitic paradigms, coupled
with contextual information which aids participant identification, full noun
phrases are not frequently needed. In the following excerpt, for example,
seven Set I clitics and one Set II clitic occur. There are no noun phrases
referring to subject, object, genitive, or oblique participants. In clause (g)
there is zero reference to the subject:

head.'","[82, 83, 84]"
"8.1.3 Clausal disjunction (p or q). The logical notion of disjunction may not
be well integrated into the system of inter-clausal relations of Yagua. In
elicitation via Spanish, speaker after speaker simply responds si 'yes' to an
Or'-type question, or else fails to answer it, treating it as unintelligible.
More bilingual speakers, who comprehend the disjunctive relation signalled
by Or' in Spanish, are able to express it by employing an ""afterthought""
phrase. Such phrases are discussed in sect. 8.2.
Nevertheless, the following example is a clear case of clausal disjunction
coded simply by the pragmatically marked use of fronted free pronouns
(see sect. 16.2 and T. Payne 1987):
(134a) radyeetyaryycye

ISGrPRO-CLEFT curse-CAUS-DAY-lSG
or / cursed myself
In this excerpt there are two persons who might have cursed the speaker,
either 'the savage' or the speaker himself. In (134b) and (134c) pronouns
code each of these persons in turn. The speaker wants to know which of
the potential cursers actually did the cursing to the exclusion of the other.
If a simple proclitic instead of the pronouns were used in either of these
clauses it would not be clear that the savage and the speaker were being
contrasted. That is, the sentence would then be translated want to know298 Payne and Payneif he cursed me, the savage. I cursed myself, with no indication of the
disjunctive relationship between the two clauses.
8.2 Coordination of clause constituents. The primary means of coordinating
phrases is by simple juxtaposition. This is true for noun phrases and
postpositional phrases. Simple noun phrases can be juxtaposed with more
complex nominal constructions such as relative clauses and postpositional
phrases:

"320 Payne and Payne12.1.2 -tya. A second means of negating main clauses is with the enclitic
-tya (or occasionally -vitya). There are two seemingly anomalous facts about
-tya. First, it begins with a palatalized consonant other than ch or y. This is
an unusual segment for the beginning of any formative. Second, although it
begins with a palatalized consonant, it fails to condition fronting of a to e
in an environment where this is predicted by a very general and otherwise
productive phonological rule (see example (209) below and sect. 22 for
discussion). According to Paul Powlison (personal communication), the
grammatical origin of -tya may have included the interrogative -viy. Such an
etymology might account for both of these apparent anomalies (though we
cannot pursue the details here). Furthermore, Powlison notes that the use
of -tya usually has an exclamatory or assertive force, which we would
expect to be the case with a rhetorical question. This further supports the
suggestion that the interrogative -viy was historically involved. When it
negates main clauses, -tya is suffixed to the verb:

3 clauses). In their minimal formulation, predicate nominal clauses consist

"Syntax of the Sentence or the Clause*
1 Word order
In this sketch we will follow Silverstein (1976) and Dixon (1979) in using
the terms S, A and Ï to refer to semantico-syntactic roles. S is the only
obligatory participant of a single participant clause. In a two participant
clause, A is the most likely agent, or that participant which is encoded as
agents are most commonly encoded. Ï is the other obligatory participant of
a two participant clause. We use the term subject (Su) for the conflation of
S and A, and the term object for O. Also, following Dixon (1979) we will
use the term Sa to refer to all S participants that are treated
morphosyntactically like A participants, and S0 to refer to all S participants
that are treated morphosyntactically like Ï participants. The relevance of
this distinction for Yagua will be illustrated in sects. 1.1 and 4. We make
no distinction between direct and indirect objects. This section discusses the
three major clause types, gives some arguments for VSuO as the basic
order, and briefly mentions some difficulties regarding establishment of the
basic order. Sect. 9 presents a more in-depth description of pragmatically
motivated variations in the basic order.
1.1 Syntactically distinct clause types. We distinguish three major clause
types based on whether a verbal form is used and which participant
reference set is employed. A ""verbal form"" is defined as a non-nominalized
root which can take a significant number of inflectional suffixes including
locative, causative, potential, aspectual, and tense suffixes (sect. 18), though
the semantics of any particular verbal form may preclude the use of some
of these. There are two sets of non-fully-specified participant reference
forms which we refer to as Set I and Set II (see sect. 16 for paradigms).
Set I consists of proclitics which refer to A participants of two argument
clauses, most S's of verbal single argument clauses, possessors (sect. 15.2),
and objects of postpositional phrases (sect. 17). Set II consists of enclitics
which refer to O's of two argument clauses, the S's of a few verbal single
argument clauses, and the S's of predicate nominals and locatives.
Type 1 clauses minimally employ a verbal form and some reference to a
subject (S or A) participant. The reference to the subject can be either: 1)
a Set I proclitic on the verb (ex. la), 2) a Set I proclitic and a postverbal
noun phrase (ex. Ib), or 3) a preverbal noun phrase (ex. Ic):254 Payne and Payne(la)so-mur44y
3SGI-sing:to:call:spirits
'He is singing to call the spirits.'","[4, 5, 6]"
"The coreferential -yu can be anteceded by possessors as well as subjects.
As with all Set II clitics, -yu always occurs postverbally but is not
necessarily attached to the verb. Rather, when the object is not expressed
as a full noun phrase -yu cliticizes to the last word of the clause.

either the subject of the clause or the possessor of the subject noun phrase.
That is, (65) could also mean 'Her son answered himself.' This, however, is
pragmatically much less likely than the reading indicated above. Similarly
(66) could also mean 'In hisj house hej struck himselfj'. It is not the case
that subject necessarily controls reference of -yu, however, as the reading

23 Nominal and adjectival morphology
In this section we discuss aspects of morphology not covered elsewhere.
Sect. 23.1 discusses noun classifiers (CLASS) which play an important role
in nominal, demonstrative, and numerical morphology. Sect. 23.2 discusses
morphology on nominal roots and stems. Noun compounding, which is quite
extensive, is only incidentally considered. Sect. 23.3 discusses morphology on
different kinds of nominal modifiers.
23.1 Noun classifiers. There are somewhere in the neighborhood of 40
noun classifiers (CLASS), listings of which are found in Powlison and
Powlison (1958) for the Vainilla dialect, and Doris Payne (1986a) for the
Cahocuma and San Jose de Loretoyacu dialects. Where the etymology is
transparent, it is clear that noun classifiers derive from the last one or two
syllables of nominal roots. For example, jay is the noun meaning 'skin' or
'pelt' and -jay is the classifier for skin or cloth-like items. Sujay signifies
'cloth', but there is no word or morpheme su- with a meaning somehow
related to 'cloth'.
Classifiers are obligatorily suffixed to demonstrative roots (sect. 16.4) and
infixed to numeral roots. The classifiers serve to show agreement between
a demonstrative or numeral and its head.
Classifiers may also be suffixed to nominal, verbal, some adverbial, and
adjectival roots (the last constitutes an extremely small class, perhaps
limited to one or two items; Doris Payne 1985b). Suffixation of a classifier
to a verbal, adverbial, or adjectival root derives a syntactic noun.
Agreement between a descriptive modifier (the functional equivalent of an
adjective) and its head noun, and between a subject and predicate nominal
in predicate nominal constructions is Optional' from a sentence grammar
perspective.
There is a neutral classifier -ra which can reference either animate or
inanimate entities. This is particularly true when it functions as a
nominalizer or as part of a relativizer (sect. 14). Other Yagua classifiers
indicate shape, spatial orientation, function, consistency and animacy of
nouns. The animate classifiers also indicate number:446 Payne and Payne(664)-nü
-nuuy
-vayanimate singular
animate dual
animate pluralHere we list a few examples of selected classifiers. The classifier for short
sticks and tubers is saa or see depending on dialect. The neutral classifier
-ra is often used with demonstratives when the head noun is overtly present
in the phrase and references an inanimate item, regardless of the existence
of a more specific classifier for the item in question.

Development of additional classifiers may be in process. Certain noun
roots are infixed to numerals, just as classifiers are, when there is no
classifier specific to that noun. For example:448 Payne and Payne(670)tarooriquii
ta-rooriy-quii
one-house-one
One house'Given that development of additional classifiers may be in process, the
difference between noun compounding versus suffixation of a classifier is
not always clear-cut. In the following examples the complex forms could be
viewed as noun compounds in that the second morpheme also occurs as an
independent noun root:

cf. juru(673)'seed''powder, ash'cajiijya4
cajiiy-ja4
coffee-CLASS:liquid
'coffee ready to drink'
cf. j4a'water'However, arguments for the status of the second morpheme as a classifier
in this context are three-fold. First, the potential classifier is suffixed to
another noun root, as are all clearly affixal categories. In some cases of
noun compounding (cf. sect. 15.3), it is arguable that the modifying noun
precedes the head noun. Second, although in certain instances these
classifiers retain their original meaning, other examples make it clear that
their meanings have been generalized such that the classifier can occur with
a variety of items. For example, -siiy occurs not only as a classifier for
seeds, but also for buttons, shotgun shot, sweet potatoes, light bulbs, wood
chips, and other items (Powlison and Powlison 1958). Third, we see no
principled difference between the word-formation process evident in theYagua 449examples immediately above, versus that which occurs in the following
ones. In those which follow, the second morpheme of each word does not
occur as an independent noun root (though it does correspond to the last
syllable of a noun root).

23.2.1 Prefixal morphology. There is a group of words depicting abstract
qualities which have the prefix va-. Words containing this prefix can serve
as predicates of non-verbal predications:

"302 Payne and Payne(141e) When two participants are given information, an object participant
weakly tends to follow an oblique ( = postpositional) participant
(63%). The figures for definite status are the same: When both
participants are definite, an object participant weakly tends to
follow an oblique participant (64%).
9.2 Marked pragmatic structures. The marked nucleus in Ya<""'a consists of
a pragmatically marked (PM) constituent, followed by the remainder of the
nucleus. The pragmatically marked constituent is usually asserted. The
remainder is generally presupposed information. It is simply that part which
provides a frame for the pragmatically marked constituent. The primary
strategies used to indicate pragmatically marked constituents within the
nucleus are placement of information before the verb, use of niy- 'cleft' or
jffta following preverbal constituents (see sect. 9.3), and use of free
pronouns.
A pragmatically marked constituent encodes some information to which
the speaker particularly wants to call the hearer's attention. The
information may be either new or given. Although independently identifying
such elements apart from the coding devices mentioned above may appear
somewhat subjective, we maintain that such motivations are real factors
underlying the existence and use of special constructions in language. In
many cases certain independently identifiable contexts are found to favor
the coding devices mentioned above. These contexts include: information
questions and answers to such (Dik 1978), (some) absolute questions,
negation, contrast (Chafe 1976, Dik et al. 1981), and restatement (Dik et
al. 1981, Dooley 1982). (See Doris Payne 1985b and T. Payne 1985 and
1987 for quantification of these contexts and examples which as yet remain
unexplained.)
The following illustrates a very common pattern for information
questions. The PM constituent is echoed following the remainder. In
answers to information questions, the information asserted in the answer is
fronted before the verb:

'fall' and the locative naavaachiy 'from above' are asserted. If (142b) was
not an answer to a question, however, the oblique would occur
postverbally.
If a particular element of a polar question is being questioned, that
element may occur before the verb:

"Forms which are syntactically nominal may be used to modify verbal
actions, and hence qualify as adverbs by the above definition. In (586), for

21 Particles and clitics
Particles and clitics can be divided into three classes with regard to
functional scope: phrasal (sect. 21.1), sentential (sect. 21.2), and discourse
(sect. 21.3). With regard to direction of phonological attachment, all except
Set I participant reference clitics are enclitics. With regard to syntactic
position, there are constituent-initial, constituent-final, and second-position
clitics.
21.1 Phrasal clitics. There are two types of phrasal clitics: phrase-initial
participant reference clitics and certain more elusive phrase-final enclitics.
The phrase-initial clitics consist of the Set I and Set II participant reference
clitics. The Set I proclitics occur on verbs, nouns and postpositions, and are
discussed in sects. 15.2, 16, 17 and 18. Set II participant reference enclitics
occur immediately preceding a (roughly) definite direct object noun phrase
(sect. 16). These form a syntactic constituent with the following direct
object noun phrase, but a phonological constituent with the preceding word.
Hence Set II clitics also occur in phrase-initial position. Set II enclitics are
discussed in sects. 1.1 and 16.1.3.
Second, there are several phrase-final enclitics. These include -tee
'intensity', -ntiy 'repetition', -diiy (function unclear) and -day (function
unclear). These clitics may occur on verbs, noun phrases, or postpositional
phrases. They are italicized in the following examples:

Yarina Lake.'","[169, 170]"
"The Set II enclitic may be used in examples such as (379), but it is more
common for it to be left out. Hence it appears that the function of the
direct object enclitics in Yagua does not strictly correspond with
definiteness.
T. Payne (1985, chapter 5) discusses at length the functional difference
between direct objects coded with full noun phrases alone and those coded
with full noun phrases plus preceding clitics. In general, direct objects that
are central characters of the text are more likely to be coded with a Set II
enclitic than direct objects that play only a transitory role. The findings are
somewhat inconclusive, however, and more research on the function of the
Set II enclitics in discourse is in order.
16.1.4 Clitic reference in ditransitive clauses. There is a small class of
verbs in Yagua, including sgqy 'give' and diitya 'show' which are ditransitive.
Two objects are always implied and normally both are referenced, either
with clitics, noun phrases or both. Transitive verbs causativized with the
suffix -taniy also may have two objects. For all two-object clauses one
object, the semantic recipient or causee, is generally definite and animate.
The other, the patient, is usually non-specific and almost never human. Set
II enclitics are used to reference both 'direct' and 'indirect objects' (the
recipient or causee) of ditransitive clauses. We will avoid using the term
'indirect object' in a syntactic sense here simply because we know of no
structural or syntactic evidence that differentiates 'direct' and 'indirect'
objects. For example, the semantic recipient or causee is never encoded in
a postpositional phrase. Furthermore, both objects in a two object clause
may be preceded by Set II enclitics, they may occur in either order, and
both can be relativized.
When the patient object is expressed as a full noun phrase, this noun
phrase may either precede or follow the semantic recipient/causee. If there
is a difference in identifiability (definiteness) between the two objects, the
more definite one usually comes finally in the clause (this is not an
absolute rule and there are additional factors determining relative order of
the objects; see Doris Payne 1985b):

The most neutral position for descriptive modifiers is following the head
noun. Text studies show that the order head-modifier is by far the most
frequent (Doris Payne 1985b). The order modifier-head is used only when
the modifier is negated, contrasted, or is one of two inherently adjectival
roots when these occur in an unsuffixed form (see sect. 19). Most
commonly, however, even the inherently adjectival roots occuf in suffixed
forms and follow the head.
The order modifier-head might be said to occur in compound noun
constructions. (Many 'compound nouns' are actually similar in function to
genitive constructions, where the unmarked order is possessor-head.) In the
context from which the following comes, the item being discussed is a roof
beam, not a house:
(313)rooriryudii
rooriy-rudii
house-roof:beam
'house roof beam'Although not common, it is possible to have more than one descriptive
modifier following the head noun. These modifiers are separated by a
phonological pause with a phrase-final pitch contour preceding the pause
(see sect. 2):

depends primarily on a difference in function. The same form may serve as
either a head noun or a descriptive modifier to the head noun. For
example, the following phrase means '(a) red flower':

15.4 Nominalizations
15.4.1 Action nominalizations. Action nominalizations are formed by
suffixation of -janu (Cahocuma dialect) or -jada (Vainilla dialect; sects. 14.3
and 14.4 discuss uses of action nominalizations). We have glossed
-janul-jada as 'infinitive' (INF). However, it is not clear that 'infinitive' is a
more accurate term than 'gerund' or participial'. Suffixation of -janul-jada
does not result in the citation form of a verb. We have no evidence that
forms suffixed with -janul-jada can be used as descriptive modifiers to other
nouns (sects. 15.3 and 19). The particular interpretation of the infinitive is
dependent on the context in which it occurs:

As illustrated above, action nominalizations may serve as subject or direct
object. They may also serve as the complement of a verb of utterance,
cognition, emotion, etc., when such a complement has the same subject as
the main clause (sect. 14.3). When a verbal complement has a different
subject than does the main verb, a non-infinitive verb form is normally
used (see example 263, but cf. 262 where an infinitive form is used with a
different subject). Infinitival nominalizations may also serve as the object of
a postposition to express adverbial ideas (sect. 14.4).","[102, 103, 104, 105]"
"Yagua 279The divalent clauses without -y indicate events in which an agent acts
causally. With -y, the existence of an agent is not necessarily assumed. For
example, (71) can be used to express that someone accidentally slipped.
Comrie (1981:161) discusses a similar construction in Russian which is
referred to as an 'anti-causative' in that 'the predicate expressing the effect
has more morphological material than the causative predicate'. (It is
commonly the case that causative constructions have more morphological
material than their non-causative counterparts.)
Use of the valence decreasing -y is highly lexically restricted. It is most
productive with transitive verb roots ending with the syllable -ta (or -tyd).
This suggests the presence of an older morphological element (perhaps
related to the 'instrumental/comitative' -ta discussed in sect. 18.5).
Synchronically, however, this -ta is unanalyzable. For example, there is no
root mu with some idea of Open' related to muta Open' in (68) and (69)
above. It is also not true that all verb roots ending with -ta can take the
valence decreasing -y: sadaatyara 'She/he knows it' but *radaatyemyaa 'It
has been known/It is known'. At least three 'non-fa' verbs can take the
valence decreasing -y formative. These are caree 'to lose' (caraay 'to be
lost'), judee 'to create' (judaay 'to form/be created' (intransitive)), and
tifychu 'to tell' (tyychuy 'to be told'). This -y is unproductive for non-to
stems. First, there are many intransitive verbs without a ta- final syllable
that happen to end in the phoneme y. But there are no transitive
counterparts that differ only by absence of the final y. Second, there are
several minimal pairs of verbs that differ only in the presence versus
absence of a final -y. But except for the three pairs listed above, there is
no discernible consistency of meaning between the members of such pairs,
e.g., juvee 'to fight' (a specific kind of fighting) vs. juvaay 'do/work/make',
rupa 'to stick' vs. rupay 'to be born', jaata 'to empty' or 'to change clothes'
vs. jaatay 'to go crazy' (metaphorically 'to be emptied'?).
There are certain verb roots which can be either univalent or divalent
without addition of any valence changing morphology. When they are
univalent, the patient or experiencer of the action is treated as the subject
of the clause; when they are divalent, the patient or experiencer is treated
as the object. In (73) rupaa may be translated as either 'miss' as in 'to miss
a target' or 'escape':

"9 Pragmatic and discourse characteristics
In discourse-pragmatic terms, Yagua sentences can have nuclear, connective,
delimiting, and clarification components (see Doris Payne 1985b for fuller
discussion of pragmatic structuring). The nuclear component constitutes the300 Payne and Paynebasic predication. It is comprised of the verb or predicate, certain aspectual
and modal operators which have scope over the verb plus its arguments,
those arguments which are related to the verb by its subcategorization or
case frame, and other participants or props which are presented as
elements in the scene depicted by the verb. Such participants may be
expressed in either noun phrases or sometimes in postpositional or other
oblique phrases. Connectives are conjunctions or sequence phrases which tie
the predication in with the preceding or following context. Such phrases
usually occur before the nucleus, but may also follow it (indicated as a
connective' component). A delimiting component limits the applicability of
the nuclear component to some restricted area in the addresee's referential
field (Dooley 1982:310; cf. also Chafe 1976:50 on 'topic'). It may restrict
applicability of the predication in terms of time, location, or participant.
Clarification includes phrases which further specify the identity of some
element of the nucleus. The clarification component has scope over the
nucleus, but it need not be linearly contiguous to the nucleus. It may
actually occur after a connective1 component.
For Yagua, the overall pragmatic structuring of a clause or sentence can
be diagramed as in (140). Bracketing indicates pragmatic scope. Linear
order is not necessarily indicated by the structure in (140).
(140)[ Connective [ Non-Nuclear Delimiting Component
[ Nucleus ] Clarification ] Connective' ]In what follows we will primarily be concerned with pragmatic structuring
within the nucleus.
9.1 Unmarked pragmatic order. We assume that there is a pragmatic
difference between (1) making an assertion (either containing all new
information or a mixture of given and new information) where the
predicate is part of the assertion, versus (2) correcting, adding, or filling in
missing information, or simply restating information, where the major
portion of the proposition (usually including the predicate) is presupposed.
The first is an expected, or communicatively more neutral, act. The second
is less expected and therefore communicatively more marked. In the
marked situation, the speaker takes pains to change in some specific way
what the hearer has taken for granted. A second major type of markedness
involves semantic operations. Here we simply claim that negation and
intensification are semantically more marked operations than are
non-negative and non-intensive assertions.
In Yagua, neutral predications of either the pragmatic or semantic variety
overwhelmingly occur with VSuO order (cf. Doris Payne 1985b).
Non-neutral predications occur with some marked constituent in preverbalYagua 301position. The preverbal constituent may be either the subject, the object, or
some oblique element. These distributional facts in themselves constitute a
strong argument that the least marked word order of Yagua is VSuO.
As just mentioned, in neutral predications the subject noun phrase always
follows the verb. The object noun phrase follows the subject. To this extent
order of verb, subject, and object is determined by syntactic relations.
However, within the unmarked nucleus the order of object and oblique
phrases relative to one another is largely determined by pragmatic factors.
In order to talk about order of objects and obliques, it is important to note
that we do not distinguish between 'direct' and 'indirect' objects (cf. sect.
1.1). Second, all objects are distinguished from obliques (sect. 1.4). For the
most part obliques are encoded in postpositional phrases.
If a clause has two objects, or an object plus an oblique, the order of
these elements is largely determined by pragmatic factors. In particular, if a
clause contains two such participants (any combination of object or oblique
phrases) the major principles governing sequencing of information are as
given in (141). We will not present a full discussion of the factors
governing order here, as they are quite complex. (For a fuller discussion,
see Doris Payne 1985b, Chapter 6. The results of that study are reflected
here. Those results differ in one or two points from the study reported in
Doris Payne 1986b.) The major generalization is that definite/given
information follows indefinite/new information. It is important to bear in
mind that the generalizations in (141) do not include subject phrases:
(141 a) If one participant is referenced just by a clitic and one by a noun
phrase, the clitic reference will occur finally in the clause (81%).
By and large, clitics are used to refer to definite/given participants;
noun phrases are used to refer to indefinite/new participants.
(141b) When two participants are referenced by noun phrases, an object
noun phrase tends to come before an oblique noun phrase (often
inside a postpositional phrase) (73%).
(141c) Regardless of the encoding device, when one participant is
indefinite and the other definite, the definite participant comes last
(73%).
(141d) Regardless of the encoding device, when one participant is new and
the other given, the given participant comes last (80%).","[51, 52, 53]"
"16.4 Demonstrative pronouns. Demonstrative forms in Yagua consist of a
demonstrative root jiy- 'this' (DEMI) or ru- 'that' (DEM2), plus a classifier
(CLASS) (sect 23) which indexes the animacy and, if animate, the number
of the item referred to:
(413)jirya
jiy-ra

dialect. In both dialects the form for 'that (animate singular)' is simply nu
(presumably etymologically related to the animate singular classifier -AIM):
(420)nu
vänu
that:ANIM:SG man
'that man'16.5 Interrogative pronouns. Interrogative pronouns occur sentence initially
and are discussed in sect. 10.
16.6 Relative pronouns. Relative pronouns are discussed in sect. 14.7.
16.7 Pronominalization and unspecified participants. The most common
way of referring to unspecified participants is through use of the following
set of pronouns:
(421)t\{
tanuuy
taväy
tara'animate singular'
'animate dual'
'animate plural
'inanimate'These forms can refer to unspecified participants in any syntactic role. For
example:
(422)tanuuy
jiya
UNSPEC.-DL go
'Some two are going.'","[126, 127]"
"252 Payne and PayneThe dialect situation within Yagua remains largely unstudied. All dialects
are mutually intelligible and most observed differences are limited to the
phonology and the phonetics of specific lexical items. However, some
grammatical differences have been noted and a number of lexical items are
not recognized from one area to another. The data for this sketch come
from two areas, (1) Cahocuma north of Villacorta on the Amazon River,
and (2) Vainilla near the confluence of the Napo and Amazon Rivers.
Yagua is the only extant member of the Peba-Yaguan language family. In
1955 Espinosa Perez reported approximately 50 older speakers of the
related language Yameo, which is now almost certainly extinct. Based on
colonial sources, Rivet (1911) listed a number of lexical items for the
now-extinct related language Peba. Although neither Espinosa nor Rivet
presents much in the way of morphological, clausal, or discourse material,
perusal of lexical items shows that Yagua, Peba, and Yameo were clearly
related. Peter Landerman (personal communication) estimates that the
differentiation is perhaps on the order of that found between Spanish and
Portuguese or Spanish and Italian, with modern Yameo as represented in
Espinosa being closer to the colonial sources than to modern Yagua. The
larger genetic affiliation of Peba-Yaguan is a matter of debate. On the
basis of mass vocabulary comparison Rivet (1911) suggests that it is Carib.
Voegelin and Voegelin (1977), following Greenberg (1960), classify it as a
major branch of Macro-Carib parallel to the Carib and Huitotoan branches.
Here we take no stand on its larger genetic affiliation.
Other names which have been associated with Peba-Yaguan include
Caumari, Cauvachi, Pacaya, Mishara, Nijamvo, Camuchivo, Masamae, and
Parara (cf. Loukotka 1968).","[3, 4]"
"In causatives formed on univalent verb stems the causee is treated as the
direct object of an ordinary divalent clause. When (roughly) definite, the
object noun phrase is preceded by the Set II clitic. The Set I clitic on the
verb agrees with the causer, not the causee.
A trivalent clause results when a causative is made from a divalent verb
stem. In this discussion we refer to both the causee and the entity acted
upon by the causee (the patient) as Objects'.
6.1 Two-object causatives when one object is non-specific. There is a
pragmatic tendency in two-object clauses for one object to be specific and
animate while the other is usually non-specific and almost never human. In
such a case, the specific object is referenced by a Set II clitic (sect. 16). If
only one of the objects is specific, it is generally the causee. However, the
causee need not be specific as (96) shows:
(96)ricy44siityaniy
mununumiyu
riy-c44siiy-taniy
mununu-miy-yu
3PL-finish-CAUS
enemy-PL-COR2
'The enemies allowed themselves to be finished off.'
(*'Theyj allowed the enemies to finish themj off.')The sense of -taniy here is 'to allow' rather than strictly causation. This
example could conceivably be glossed 'the enemies allowed (someone) to
finish them off, where 'someone' is an unspecified, non-overt causee.
If the entity acted upon by the causee is non-specific, then it cannot be
referred to with an enclitic. Either object may precede, though the
preferred form is for the non-specific object to occur first, as in (98). If
one object is referenced by only the clitic without an accompanying noun
phrase, the clitic must come finally in the clause, as in (99):
(97)riimyityänfm
Anita quiiv§
ray-jimyiy-täniy-nii
lSG-eat-CAUS-3SG Anita fish
make Anita eat (some) fish.'",[37]
"If Alchico is taken as the subject in (105) then all formal reference to the
causee has been omitted. The interpretation of (106) is parallel except that
the clitic in this case refers to an animate participant which is therefore
interpretable as the causee or the object of the caused event:
(106)siimyityäniy
quiivanff
sa-jimyiy-taniy
quiiva-nff
3SG-eat-CAUS fish-3SG
'The fish is making him eat' or
'He made the fish eat it (animate).'",[39]
"In addition to -tya and nee, constituents of rhetorical questions can be
pragmatically negated with -viy, the yes/no question particle (sect. 10.1):
(239)ravyaataviy
pasiidyeera
ray-vaata-viy
pasiiy-dee-ra
ISG-want-QM little-DIMIN-CLASS:NEUT
'Do I want a little?' (i.e., º want not a little.')A reasonable English pragmatic equivalent to (239) might be the rhetorical
question 'Do I want a little?', with the intended litotes º do not want a
little, I want a lot'.
12.4 Lexical negation. By 'lexical negation* we mean negative affixes which
are specific to different lexical items, on a par with those found in English
negative lexical items like immoral, indecent, unappreciated, non-functional,
etc. The formative -sa is the only such negative that we are aware of. This
formative indicates 'without', similar in function and meaning to the -less
suffix in English (Paul Powlison, personal communication).",[81]
"It is more difficult to answer whether jaryee is an adverbial rather than a
conjoining element. There are examples where it might be better viewed as
an adverbial such as English 'also':

In example (129) there is ellipsis of the verb phrase under coordination
with another clause. The proclitic on the postposition, however, must be
present. Similarly, subject and object noun phrases need not be overt, but
participant coding clitics cannot be omitted under coordination:296 Payne and Payne(129)naansiimyaasiy

8.1.2 Clausal postsection and presection. J. Payne (1985) makes the
cross-language observation that postsection (p and not-q) and presection
(not-p and q) are normally encoded as an analytic combination of
conjunction and negation. This is often the case in Yagua, as illustrated in
(130):

"21.2 Sentence particles and clitics
21.2.1 Non-clitic particles. The only non-clitic sentential particle is the
negative nee. This is discussed in sect. 12.
21.2.2 Second-position sentential clitics. There are several second-position
clitics. Doris Payne (1985b) argues that there are actually two groups of
'second-position' clitics: 1) those that occur after the first element of the
nuclear clause (i.e., the verb plus those arguments that are required by the
subcategorization or case frame of the verb), and 2) those that occur after
the first element of the clause or sentence including any peripheral
elements such as conjunctions, temporal, locational, or other phrases that
delimit the application of the nuclear clause. All second-position clitics are
enclitics. The question clitic -viy is discussed in sect. 10. The
conditional/adverbial/relative clitic -tiy is discussed in sect. 14. The 'cleft'Yagua 423clitic -niy is discussed in sect. 9.3. All second-position clitics may co-occur
with and precede phrasal clitics (cf. the examples which follow).
The aspectual/modal second-position clitics -maa 'perfect' and -numaa
'now' are discussed in sects. 18.2.4 and 18.3. They may co-occur with and
always precede phrasal clitics:

"Coreference is not always determined on the basis of the immediately
preceding Set I argument. In (51) yi- refers to a possessor and occurs
within the postpositional expression naadiiva yinooda 'to his mother'. The
most recently mentioned Set I argument is 'mother', represented by the
proclitic naada. Nevertheless, yi- must be construed as coreferential with
the third person singular subject of the verb rather than with the thirdYagua 273person dual object of the postposition. (Note that pragmatically the
possessor of junooda 'mother' cannot itself be the mother; people cannot
be their own mothers).

CORl-motherThe preceding examples might suggest that it is just subject that controls
reference of jfy-. This is not always true, however. Example (50) shows that
if the subject follows its coreferent, the subject itself is coded by jiy-. The
antecedent of jiy- in that example is a possessor. In example (52) jiy- refers
to the object of a postposition. It is anteceded by the possessor of jgpy
'father' rather than by the subject of the clause:

In (52) the possessor is actually a subconstituent of the subject, and it
might be argued that ""subject"" is still the relevant notion. However, T.
Payne (1985, Chapter 3) presents a more in-depth discussion of cases which
cannot be solved on the basis of subject. Rather, there are also
discourse/pragmatic factors governing interpretation of the coreference
forms.
Verbs which are inflected with jiy- cannot be inflected for time reference
(unless they occur in indirect discourse; see below). It might be argued,
therefore, that verbs with jiy- are in some sense dependent. However, jiydoes not occur with all dependent clauses. It is not used within relative
clauses or in non-nominalized adverbial clauses when a potential antecedent
occurs outside of the dependent clause (see examples in sect. 14).
In indirect discourse sentences, however, fully-inflected verbs can occur
with jiy-:274 Payne and Payne(53)syyteesiy
