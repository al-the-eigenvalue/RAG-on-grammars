"Case marking on possessive pronounsAs discussed and illustrated in subsection 2. 1. 2. 4. I., possessive
pronouns formed with the particle ki(n) can be marked for all of the
cases found in the language. Possessive pronouns formed with attaching
the genitive case to a personal pronoun cannot take further case suffixes.",[341]
"Bound affixesBound affixes, more specifically case suffixes, are the most productive
way to express syntactic functions of noun phrases. Traditional Turkish
grammarians (e.g. Gencan (1971» of Turkish recognize five cases: the
nominative (sometimes also called the absolute) for subjects, the
accusative (sometimes also called objective) for direct objects (including
derived causative direct objects which are original subjects of intransitive
. verbs), the dative for indirect objects (including derived causative
indirect objects of transitive verbs), for benefactives, and for directional
arguments with the semantic functions of goal, the locative for locational
arguments, and the ablative for directional arguments with the semantic
function of source, of object of comparison, or for partitive semantics. A
number of grammarians also recognize the genitive as a case for subjects
of nominalized clauses, in addition to being a means for expressing the
function of a noun phrase as possessor in possessive noun·phrases. The
suffixes in question are as follows:
(751)Nominative / absolute
Accusative / objective
Dative
Locative
Ablative
Genitive-039
-(y)I
-(y)A
-DA

""Ahmet knows that Ali will give the newspaper to Oya in the office
and (that) you will go from work to the concert""(752)The first noun phrase, Ahmet, is the subject of the superordinate, fully
finite, clause and is therefore in the nominative case. Ali is the subject of
the nominalized subordinate clause and is thus marked for genitive case.
Gazete is the direct object of the transitive verb ver- 'give' in the first
conjunct of the subordinate coordinate structure and is therefore marked
for accusative case. Oya is the indirect object of the same verb and is
therefore marked for dative case. Buro 'office' is a locative object in that
same conjunct and is thus marked for locative case. In the second
conjunct, i~ 'work' is a directional object that denotes 'source of action or
motion' and is therefore marked for ablative case, while konser 'concert'
is the ""target of motion"" and is thus marked for dative case. The whole
subordinate coordinate structure is the direct object of the verb bil
'know'; as a nominalized clause, it must bear case, just like any argument
which is a simple noun phrase; hence, the subordinate clause exhibits
accusative case marking.
Accusative versus dative marking of causativized subjects are illustrated
below:

"Differences between means of expressing case in the
possessive pronoun and in the nounPossessive pronouns formed with the particle ki(n) are marked for case
with the same suffixes as those used for nouns.",[341]
"Double case markingTurkish has no double case marking. Nouns in an attributive
relationship to another (head) noun in non-possessive noun phrases
have no case marking at all; only the head noun in a noun phrase bears
case morphology. In possessive noun phrases, the possessor bears
genitive case morphology and does not exhibit case agreement with the
head noun.

"Irregular forms of casesThe markers of some cases are slightly different when used with
pronouns. These differences are mentioned in conjunction with the table
in 2. 1. 2. 1. 1.: the genitive suffix for the first person singular and plural
pronouns is -(I)m instead of the regular -(I)n. In this context, a change in
the stem of pronouns when marked for case should be mentioned: the
first and second person singular pronouns ben and sen. undergo a vowel
change when marked for the dative case: ban-a and san-a, respectively.
Further, the third person pronoun o(n) loses its final consonant in word
final position, i.e. in the nominative case, which has no suffix. The final
consonant shows up before all other cases, which are overtly expressed
by suffixes, and it also shows up before the plural suffix -lar in the third
person plural form on-lar 'they' in all cases.",[334]
"Nonfinite or nominalized verbsMorphological marking of noun phrases is essentially the same for finite
and for nominalized verbs. This is true even for accusative marking of
the direct objects of nominalized verbs, which might be surprising,
considering that in many languages, nominalized verbs lose their ability
to mark their direct object for accusative case. The differences between
finite and nonfinite verbs in terms of expressing syntactic functions are
as follows:
1. The subjects of fully finite clauses are in the nominative case, while
the subjects of nonfinite or nominalized verbs are in the genitive case (cf.
2. 1. 1. 1. 1. and 2. 1. 1. 2.). The few exceptions to the latter generalization
are found with the subjects of certain nonfinite adverbial clauses whose
subjects are not marked for any case (and hence could be said to be in
the nominative case). For discussion and examples for this last point, the
reader is referred to section 1. 1.2.4. on adverb clauses.
2. Certain nominalizations allow for their direct object to be marked in
the genitive rather than in the accusative:
(796)(796)a.",[257]
"Number, class/ gender, case and other category
marking in relative pronounsThis relative pronoun is not inflected and thus is not marked for number,
class/ gender, case, or any other grammatical category.",[354]
"No changeMorphological Properties:
For all grammatical relations, the appropriate WH-word bears the same
case marker as the corresponding full noun phrase; this is exemplified
for the genitive, accusative and dative below and is true for all cases and
all positions where WH-words are found:
Genitive subject of an embedded clause:
(113)a.",[56]
"Deviations of the case system in pronouns from that
occurring with nouns
Additional casesThere are no additional cases used for pronouns.",[332]
"Case system in pronounsThe regular case system applies to pronouns, just as it does to regular
nouns. The table in 2. 1. 2. 1. 1. shows the shapes pronominal forms take
in all person and number combinations for all cases.",[332]
"301Different markers for the casesThe markers for the cases are the same for pronouns and for nouns in
general. However, there are some differences in the case marking
assigned by certain postpositions, depending on whether the
postpositional object is a pronoun or a full noun. The postpositions gibi
'like', kadar 'as much as', ile and its cliticized counterpart -(y)lA 'with',
and i~in 'for' take bare objects in general, but assign the genitive to
pronominal objects--more specifically, to pronominal objects that are
either personal pronouns, demonstrative pronouns or the interrogative
kim; e.g.

""I bought this book for him""Furthermore, there is another group of postpositions on whose objects
the same alternation between genitive case marking and no case marking
is observed, again according to whether the postpositional object is a
pronoun or a full noun:
(1084) a.",[333]
"Marking and position of noun clausesAs mentioned in section 1. 1. 2. 1., noun clauses are marked by
""nominalization"" markers as well as ""nominal"" agreement and case
markers. The latter will be those appropriate to the thematic role and
grammatical relation of the subordinate clause with respect to the verb
of the main clause and will be the same as the case markers found on
simple noun phrases in the same position and with the same thematic
role.
As mentioned in the introduction to this section on subordination, noun
clauses occupy the positions appropriate to their grammatical and
thematic roles; thus, a noun clause which is a subject will be in initial50Syntaxposition of the main clause, given that the basic word order is SOY; a
noun clause which is an object will be between the main subject and
verb. Thus, compare the following examples, where a noun clause has
been juxtaposed with a simple noun phrase:
Subject clause:

""Zeynep was very saddened by this news""1. 1. 2. 2. 2.","[81, 82]"
"Word orderWord order does not express the syntactic and semantic functions of
noun phrases in general. As we saw in sections 1. 11., 1. 12., and 1. 14.,
word order in Turkish is dictated by discourse considerations. However,
there are some instances where word order does interact with the
syntactic and semantic functions of the noun phrase, albeit indirectly.
This happens when a noun phrase is non-specific and therefore cannot
be suffixed with the accusative case marker when it is a direct object;
similarly, a non-specific noun phrase cannot bear a genitive case suffix
when it is the subject of an embedded nominalized clause. In both
instances, these ""bare"" noun phrases must be immediately pre-verbal216Morphologyand cannot be moved away from that position. It should be noted that
the same relationship between non-specificity and restriction on
positioning holds also of subjects of main clauses, as well. No case suffix
is being omitted in this instance, however, since nominative case is not
expressed overtly in any event. Examples of each type follow:
Non-specific subject of finite clause (otherwise in the nominative case):
(760)koy
-u haydut -lar bas -mI~
village -Acc. robber -pI. raid -Rep.Past
""Robbers are said to have raided the village""Non-specific direct object (otherwise in the accusative case):
(761)Hasan <;ocug -un -a
her alq;am
bir hikaye oku-r
Hasan child -3.sg. -Dat. each evening a
story
read-Aor.
""Hasan reads a story to his child every evening""Non-specific subject of nominalized clause (otherwise in the genitive
case):
(762)[ koy
-u haydut bas -bg
-m] -1
duy -du -m
village -Acc. rcbber raid -FNom -3.sg. -Ace. hear-Past-1.sg.
""I heard that robbers raided the villiage""We might then say that a noun phrase without overt case marking in
immediate pre-verbal position is either a subject or a direct object, if it is
non-specific. The syntactic context and the semantics of the utterance are
going to determine which one of these possibilities is realized.","[247, 248]"
"Means of expressing case in demonstrative pronouns
and in nounsThe various cases are expressed in demonstrative pronouns by using the
same suffixes as those used to express case in nouns. The tables and
examples in 2. 1. 2. 5. 1. illustrate the various cases in demonstratives.
2. 1. 2. 5. 7.",[347]
"Detai]s of differences between case on reflexives versus
case on pronounsWe saw in subsections 2. 1. 2. 1. 20. 1. 4. and 2. 1. 2. 1. 20. 1. 5. as well as
in the table in subsection 2. 1. 2. 1. 1. that first person singular and plural
pronouns have irregular genitive forms, and that pronouns that are the
objects of certain postpositions carry the genitive case, as opposed to
lexical nouns that are not marked for case in the same context. Reflexives
behave like lexical nouns in both respects. The next set of examples show
a reflexive as a postpositional object, in contrast to a noun phrase headed
by a lexical noun and to a pronoun:

""I bought this book for him""304MorphologyAs for the shape of the genitive suffix, while it is difficult to find fully
grammatical examples of genitive reflexives, these are possible in
restricted contexts. For example, reflexive genitives can function as
predicate nominals, especially if they are marked with ki, a morpheme
which turns a noun or a pronoun it attaches to into a kind of possessive
pronoun (or relative clitic pronoun) when it follows the genitive suffix:
(1087)bu
kitap kendi -ill
-m
-ki
this book self
-l.sg. -Gen. -Poss.Pr. /Rel.Cl.
""This book is the one which is my own""-dir
-Ep.Cop.","[335, 336]"
"As discussed in subsection 2. 1. 2. 1. on personal pronouns, the shape of
the genitive suffix is unusual in the first persons, with the consonant
changing form n to m.
Furthermore, there is the particle ki(n), which derives possessive
pronouns from nouns as well as pronouns, when either type is marked
for genitive case (as well as deriving possessive pronouns in the
extended sense, when a noun or pronoun is marked for the locative):
profesor -un
-ki
professor -Gen. -Rel.el
""the one belonging to the professor""(1095)a.",[339]

I
-Gen. -Rel.eL
""the one belonging to me; mine""As examples (1095) and (1096)b illustrate, the particle ki(n) does not
undergo Vowel Harmony; however, there are two nouns after which it
does behave in a regular fashion in undergoing Vowel Harmony: dUn
'yesterday' and gUn 'day':
(1097)dun
-kii
yesterday -Rel.el
""yesterday's; the one pertaining to yesterday""This suffix can attach freely to inflected nouns; thus it can be suffixed to
nouns bearing plural and / or possessive suffixes:308Morphology(1098)arkada~-lar -lffi

-pI. -l.sg. -Gen. -Rel.e!
""my friends'; the one belonging to my friends""It should be noted, however, that ki(n) can attach only to nouns bearing
either the genitive or the locative; it cannot follow other case markers;
but it can precede any case marker:
(1099)profesor -un

professor -Gen. -Rel.e! -Abl.
""from the one belonging to the professor; from the professor's""A list illustrating all of the cases follows:

a pronoun:
(1101)~imdi-kinow -Rel.e!
""the one pertaining to now; the present moment's""Note that the final n of this suffix is similar to the one of the third person
singular pronoun o(n) in that it is omitted in word final position; it
surfaces before case suffixes, as shown in (1100), but it drops before the
plural suffix, thus behaving differently from the third person singular
pronoun:

marker.

"Denominal postpositionsSome borrowed nominals can be used as postpositions; e.g.:
(1678)inat 'obstinacy, stubbornness'is a borrowing from Arabic.
This noun can be used as a postposition, meaning 'despite of, in spite of';
the complement is placed in the dative case:
(1679)Hasan [ ban -a
inat] ~
-e
git-ti
Hasan
I
-Oat. spite
work -Dat. go -Past
""Hasan went to work despite my wishes to the contrary""Other nouns, mostly borrowed, can be used as postpositions when
inflected with possessive agreement suffixes and a case morpheme
which can be of one particular type only in this function:
(1680)hak'right'is a borrowing from Arabic. It takes the locative case in its use as a
postposition; it then means 'concerning; about':
(1681)hakk -1m
-da
right -l.sg. -we.
""about me; concerning me""(1682)taraf'side'is also a borrowing from Arabic. It takes the ablative case in its use as a
postposition; it then means 'by, through the agency of' and typically
heads an agentive phrase in passive constructions:Morphology

side -1. pl.

-Abl.","[502, 503]"
"279Optionality versus obligatoriness of referenti a1ity in the
noun phraseThe overt morphological distinction between referential and
nonreferential noun phrases can be made only where either the
accusative or the genitive case can be marked. In such contexts, the
marking for referentiality (Le. the case morphology) is obligatory, since if
that marking does not occur, the reading will be one of nonreferentiality.
However, in other syntactic contexts, Le. where either nominative or
oblique case is assigned, the distinction in question is not marked
morphologically: the nominative is never marked morphologically
(irrespective of referentiality), and oblique cases are always marked
overtly, again irrespective of referentiality.",[311]
"Subject of intransitive verb, transitive verb,
and of copuJar constructionSubjects of intransitive verbs, of transitive verbs, and of copular
constructions are all marked in the same way: they are all in the
nominative case when they are the subjects of a fully finite, tensed
clause, and they are usually in the genitive case, when they are the
subjects of a nominalized subordinate clause (cf. 2. 1. 1. 1. 1.). Example
(752) illustrates the nominative subject of a transitive verb, the genitive
subject of a transitive verb and the genitive subject of an intransitive
verb. Nominative case is not marked overtly in Turkish. The genitive is
marked via a suffix: -(n)In for third person, -(I)m for first person, and
-(I)n for second person. Thus, the genitive is unusual among all case
suffixes in changing its shape for different person features of the noun it
attaches to. The subject of certain adverbial nominalized clauses bearing
the factive nominalization marker is unusual in that it carries no case
suffix at all (cf. 1. 2. 1. 3. 1. 4.).
The same case marking is found on the subject of a copular construction:
(766)ben
hasta
I (Nom.) sick
""I am sick""-YlID
-l.sg.",[249]
"Case on reflexives versus case on pronounsThe few anomalies with respect to case marking that were discussed
with respect to pronouns are not exhibited by reflexives. In other words,
reflexives behave like regular nouns with respect to the shape of the case
suffixes, specifically with respect to the genitive suffix.",[335]
"Case marking in the interrogativesInterrogatives can be marked for case. Individual forms are shown, with
discussion, in 2. 1. 2. 6. 1. 1. 1. The case markers used are the same ones
used for nouns.",[351]
"Inserted morphological materialOther than the Genitive case and the nominalization morphemes
themselves, no morphological material is inserted into nonfinite clauses.
In this respect, Turkish differs from languages like English, where
prepositions like of (as in: the conquest of Rome) are inserted before
arguments, especially before direct objects. In Turkish, the original case
markers on the arguments found in finite clauses are retained in the
corresponding nonfinite clauses; this is true even for the Accusative case;
e.g.
(241)[ Ahmed -m
Mehmed -i
oldiir -me
-sin] -den
Ahmet -Gen. Mehmet -Acc. kill
-ANom .-3.sg. -Abl.

""I am afraid that Ahmet might / will kill Mehmet""Syntax1. 1. 2. 2. 6. 6.","[88, 89]"
"In this construction, the topicalized element is initial and bears the nonalternating case marking for dative, which is the case assigned by the
verb gel 'come'. That verb appears in this construction in its converb
form (cf. section 1. 2. 1. 3. 1. 4. on adverbial clauses). A proform of the
dislocated constituent appears in the sentence and bears the case
marking appropriate to that position, which, in example (725), is the
accusative.",[233]
"Antecedent: direct object, reciprocal: object of adjectiveThe existence of such relationships depends on the considerations
outlined in subsection 1. 7. 5. 44. It is possible to have constructions such
as the following:
(626)ben [ siz
-i i [birbir -iniz -den i emin]] bi! -Ir -di -m
I
you(pl.)-Acc. e.o. -2.pI.-Abi. sure
know-Aor.-Past -l.sg.
""I used to believe you to be sure of each other""If, in accordance with what was said previously, the noun phrase with
the accusative case marking is viewed as the direct object of the main
clause, then (626) illustrates a direct object, functioning as the antecedent
of a reciprocal object of an adjective. However, if the outer brackets mark
the clause boundaries of a subordinate clause, then the accusativemarked noun phrase is a subject rather than a direct object. In that case,
direct objects cannot function as antecedents of reciprocal objects of
adjectives.",[200]
"Other objects governed by verbsIn section 2. 1. 1. 2. 4. we saw some possibilities for cases other than the
accusative being assigned to noun phrases which would correspond to
direct objects in English. In section 2. 1. 1. 1. 1. we saw that cases other
than the accusative are assigned to noun phrases that function as the
indirect object or as directional objects, e.g. the locative case is assigned
to objects designating a location, the ablative case is assigned to objects
expressing the source of a motion, the dative case is assigned to objects
that express the target of a motion. In addition to those, there is the
instrumental ""clitic"", whose status as a case marker is not recognized by
most traditional grammars of Turkish. An example follows:
(781)Hasan pencere -yi
balta-yla
kIr -dl
Hasan window-Ace. axe -with break-Past
""Hasan broke the window with (an) axe""This cliticized instrumental marker has also a counterpart which is a free
morpheme: ilea Thus, the previous example would be as follows when
the free morpheme is used instead:
(782)Hasan pencere -yi
balta He
kIr -dl
Hasan window-Acc. axe with break-Past
""Hasan broke the window with (an) axe""When the free morpheme cliticizes onto the noun phrase, its vowel
becomes a palatal glide after a stem-final vowel, and it drops after a
stem-final consonant. The clitic becomes part of the phonological word
with respect to Vowel Harmony, as illustrated in (781), where the
original front vowel Ie I becomes [al, due to the backness of the222Morphologypreceding vowels in the stem. However, the cliticized instrumental is
exceptional with respect to word stress. Turkish has word-final stress in
general, but, as can be seen in (781), stress must precede the
instrumental; in other words, for stress assignment purposes, the
instrumental suffix behaves as though it were outside the domain of the
phonological word.","[253, 254]"
".Special reciprocal pronouns as opposed to common nouns
used as reciprocalsThere are reciprocal pronouns which are formed by the duplicated
morpheme bir 'one', to which appropriate possessive suffixes are
attached:

thus the possessive inflections are all plural, as well. However, as is the
case elsewhere with third person plural possessives, the third person
singular possessive suffix can be used optionally with third person
plural meaning. The resulting form is birbiri, which can be used instead
ofbirbirleri, with all of the case inflections listed above.
Further, the base form used by some speakers instead of birbiri is
biribiri, with all appropriate possessive and case suffixes attached.
However, the form preferred in the written language is birbiri.",[337]
"Direct objectThe direct object bears accusative case marking (i.e. the suffix -(y)I),
unless it is either non-specific or generic and incorporated. In those latter
instances, the direct object bears no overt case marking:
(771)a.(ben) kitab -1

""I read a book [non-specific]""(771)c.(ben) kitap oku -du -ill
I
book read -Past -1.sg.
""I read books [non-specific/ generic]""Some verbs assign oblique cases to their objects. These objects might
correspond to direct objects in English; e.g. the verb nefret et 'hate'
assigns ablative case to its object, the verb bin 'mount, ride' and yardl1ll
et 'help' (among a number of others) assign dative case:
(772)Hasan ben -den nefret ed -er

""Hasan rides horses""(774)Hasan ban -a

""Hasan helped me""-er

-ti-PastWhether a direct object is assigned accusative or oblique case is
determined by the governing verb. Whether a direct object that would
otherwise receive accusative case carries the corresponding suffix or not
is determined by its specificity. (Note, incidentally, that oblique case220Morphologysuffixes are always attached, even where the direct object is non-specific;
this is illustrated in example (773).)
It is irrelevant for the expression of the direct object function whether the
subject of the clause is expressed as a free or as a bound element or if the
subject remains unexpressed. An example for each of these syntactic
contexts is given:

""Hasan is sure of his spouse""It appears that some adjectives assign case to their objects. This is always
an oblique case (as the dative and ablative in the examples above);
adjectives cannot assign accusative. For example, an adjective that might
be expected to assign . accusative case (due to its morphological
relationship to a transitive verb) is kIskan~ 'jealous, envious', related to
the transitive verb laskan 'to envy':
(794)Hasan Ali -yi
kIskan -Ir
Hasan Ali -Ace. envy
-Aor.
""Hasan envies Ali""Notice that this verb is transitive; it assigns accusative case to its direct
object. The related adjective is not transitive in the same sense; it cannot
assign accusative case (nor any other case):

"Deriving adjectiveshorul-da '(to) snore'
taku-da '(to) make a tapping
or knocking sound'A variety of suffixes that derive adjectives from other categories are
illustrated below. Given that many adjectives can be used as nouns (and
vice versa), a number of these suffixes are the same as those illustrated in
section 2. 2. 1. on deriving nouns, and its subsections. More information
on verbal adjectives can be found in section 1. 1. 2. 3. on adjective
(relative) clauses. Such verbal adjectives, including participles that
consist of verbal stems marked with simple tense/ aspect suffixes (cf.
sections 2. 1. 3. 2. and 2. 1. 3. 3.) as well as participles characterized by
suffixes like -(y)An and -DIK, which are typical for adjectival clauses,
have essentially sentential syntax; for example, they can assign
accusative case to direct objects if they are formed from transitive verbs,
and they can carry passive morphology. (Their subjects are in the
genitive case rather than in the nominative, however). In contrast, the
deverbal adjectives illustrated below have syntactic properties that are
similar to those of underived adjectives.",[488]
"Antecedent: direct object, reflexive: object of adjectiveThe existence of such relationships depends on the considerations
outlined in subsection 1. 6. 5. 44. It is possible to have constructions as
the following:
(569)ben [ sen -i i [kendi -n
-deni emin ]] bi!
-ir -di-m
I
you-Ace. self -2.sg.-Abl. sure
know-Aor.-Past-l.sg.
""I used to believe you to be sure of yourself""If, in accordance with what was said previously, the noun phrase with
the accusative case marking i~ viewed as the direct object of the main
clause, then (569) illustrates a direct object, functioning as the antecedent
of a reflexive object of an adjective. However, if the outer brackets mark
the clause boundaries of a subordinate clause, then the accusativemarked noun phrase is a subject rather than a direct object. In that case,
direct objects cannot function as antecedents of reflexive objects of
adjectives.",[180]
"Absent casesThere are no absent cases in the application of the case system to
pronouns.",[332]
"Different uses of the casesThere are no differences in the use of the individual cases with pronouns
and with nouns.",[332]
"299Comitative conjunction constructions with pairs of
pronounsThe phenomenon discussed in the previous subsection also occurs with
pairs of pronouns:
(1079)biz sen
-m
-Ie
bu ak§am
Slnema -ya
we you(sg.) -Gen. -with this evemng cinema -Dat.
gid -ecek -ti
-k
go -Fut. -Past -l.pI.
a ""We were going to go to the movies with you this evening""
b. ""You and I were going to go to the movies this evening""Again, just as is the case when the element marked with the comitative
conjunction is a full lexical noun phrase, the plural subject pronoun can
be omitted, and the ambiguity in question is preserved:
(1080)sen
-in
-Ie
bu ak§am
sinema -ya
you(sg.) -Gen. -with this evemng cinema -Dat.
gid -ecek -ti
-k
go -Fut. -Past -l.pI.
a ""We were going to go to the movies with you this evening""
b. ""You and I were going to go to the movies this evening""Note that as is the case in many instances where a case is assigned by a
postposition instead of a verb, the pronoun which is the object of the
comitative conjunction is marked with the genitive suffix. However,
when a noun phrase with a full lexical head is the object of the same
postposition, it may (or sometimes must) not carry that case. This is so
with -(y)lA, which is a cliticized postposition. It is interesting to note that
when -(y)lA is used as a conjunction rather than as a genuine comitative
postposition, the Genitive is preferably omitted on its pronominal
phonological host:
(1081)sen
-Ie
ben bu ak§am
sinema -ya
you(sg.) -and I
this evening cmema -Dat.
gid -ecek -ti
-k
go -Fut. -Past -l.pI.
""You and I were going to go to the movies this evening""The same is true of the comitative conjunction constructions in question:300(1082)Morphology

a. ""?We were going to go to the movies with you this evening""
b. ""You and I were going to go to the movies this evening""It is therefore reasonable to analyze the comitative conjunction
construction as a conjunction construction rather than as a comitative
construction, and the occurrence of the element -(y)lA in these
constructions as a conjunction marker rather than as a comitative
postposition. 512.1.2.1.19.","[331, 332]"
"When the noun phrase is non-specific and is either a direct object or the
subject of a subordinate nominalized clause, the accusative and the214Morphologygenitive suffixes are not attached to a noun phrase. Such noun phrases
remain ""bare"", without any attachment of case suffix.

""I read a very interesting book yesterday""The indefinite noun phrase bir kitap 'a book' can have, in principle,
either the reading of being a specific book or that of being non-specific.
In the first instance, it would bear overt accusative marking. In the
second instance, illustrated in (755), it is not marked for accusative
overtly and is therefore interpreted as non-specific. Attachment of the
genitive case suffix (or lack thereof) is discussed further, with examples,
in 2. 1. 1. 1. 5. and in 2. 1. 1. 2. 1.","[245, 246]"

"Operational definition for the noun phraseNoun phrases are constituents whose last word is a noun and which
bear case markers in syntactic contexts where overt case is assigned, i.e.
where they function as complements of verbs and of postpositions.",[137]
"Morphology423Other uses of postpositions can be found in 1. 2. 4. on postpositional
phrases, especially in 1. 2. 4. 2. on postpositional phrases and their
arguments. A brief survey is given here for the reader's convenience.
Obsolete forms will not be discussed.
Postpositions can be grouped into two classes: 1. postpositions that do
not bear agreement morphology with their objects; 2. postpositions that
do exhibit (possessive) agreement morphology with their objects and can
thus be analyzed as nouns rather than genuine postpositions.
The first group consists of postpositions that assign a variety of cases to
their objects or that co-occur with objects that are not overtly marked for
case.

"With nonsingular nounsNonsingular nouns can be marked for indefiniteness within their noun
phrase via indefinite quantifiers like bazl 'some':
(1017)bazl elma -lar
some apple -pI.
""some apples""Further, as indicated in 2. 1. 1. 11. 1. (and to be further discussed in
2. 1. 1. 12.), non-specific noun phrases (singular as well as non-singular)
cannot be marked overtly for accusative and genitive case, where the
noun phrase is a direct object or a subject of a nominalized clause,
respectively. Since non-specific noun phrases are indefinite, this is a way
of marking indefiniteness in non-singular noun phrases, as well:
(1018)dun
~k
garlp
kitap -lar oku -du -m
yesterday very strange book -pI. read -Past -l.sg.
""Yesterday I read very strange books""Note that the direct object noun phrase is lacking accusative case and is
therefore interpreted as non-specific and therefore also as indefinite.
Had the same noun phrase been marked for overt accusative in the same
syntactic position and with the same grammatical relation, it would be
interpreted as definite (and specific):
(1019)dun
~k
garlp
kitap -lar -I
oku -du -m
yesterday very strange book -pI. -Acc. read -Past -l.sg.
""Yesterday I read the very strange books""Without a determiner and with the accusative marker, the interpretation
of this noun phrase has to be definite. However, if an indefinite
determiner like bazl 'some' shows up in such a syntactic context, the
interpretation is indefinite. In that case, the accusative marking on the
head noun will mark the noun phrase as specific, while the indefinite
determiner will mark it as indefinite:Morphology

""Yesterday I read some very strange books (indefinite, specific)""It should be noted that utterances like (1020) are not judged to be perfect
by all speakers. For many speakers, the author of this book included,
marking for specificity and marking for indefiniteness can successfully
co-occur only to the extent that specificity is expressed clearly, via
modification (e.g. by relative clauses):

"223Subject complementConstructions like the English 'I was made king' can be productively
expressed in two distinct ways in Turkish. The first one would be by
simply using the verb 01 'become', illustrated in the previous subsection:
(787)(ben) dekan 01
-du-m
I
dean become -Past -l.sg.
""I became/have become dean""The second construction involves using abstract nouns as complements,

question particle, and the latter particle (mI) cannot follow a copula (or
copular sequence); it follows nominals (which may be marked for case),
adjectives, and participles (with verb stems carrying simple tense / aspect
morphology included in the latter). The comitative particle, functioning
as a case marker, must be closest to a nominal stem (and, due to its
function, must attach to the noun without case markers). The adverb
-(y)ken attaches to nouns (which may be marked for case), adjectives and
participles (including simple tensed verbs, but excluding simple verbs
marked with the definite past and the conditional). It cannot follow
copular forms, but must precede them. It also cannot follow the
connective DA, nor can it follow the Yes/No question particle. 97 The
connective DA, in turn, can follow nouns (which may carry case
markers), adjectives and participles, adverbs, and tensed verbs as well as
tensed copular forms. Thus, different attachment sites -can exist for DA:
(1536)Oya Ahmet -Ie
-yken de
kIskan<;-h
Oya Ahmet -Com. -when -too jealous -Past
""Oya was jealous when she was with Ahmet, too
(i.e. she has been jealous at various times,
and she was jealous when with Ahmet, as well)""(1537)Oya Ahmet -Ie
-yken ktskan<; -h
da
Oya Ahmet -Com. -when jealous -Past -too
""Oya, when she was with Ahmet, was jealous, too
(i.e. among various properties Oya had while being with Ahmet,
she was jealous, too)""We conclude that the scope of the connective is dependent on the site of
its attachment.
It should also be noted that the connective must precede the Yes/No
question marker.

"PronounPronouns belong to closed sets of lexical items. There is the set of simple
personal pronouns, the set of demonstrative pronouns, the set of
reflexive pronouns, a special sort of reflexive that functions as a special
anaphoric pronoun, and the set of reciprocal pronouns. Pronouns can act
as proforms for noun phrases, can be the objects of postpositions and
verbs and can take on case morphology. Hence, any word that belongs
to any of the mentioned closed sets of words and exhibits appropriate
syntactic and morphological behavior is a pronoun.",[241]
"Differences informs used in clirect and indirect questionsThe interrogative forms used in direct and indirect questions are the
same. The only difference is found when an interrogative pronoun is in
subject position. When such a pronoun is the subject of a direct question,
it is, like all subjects, in the nominative, and thus not suffixed for case.
When an interrogative pronoun is the subject of an indirect question, it is
suffixed with the genitive marker, again in the same way as all subjects
of subordinate clauses are marked.",[352]
"B. Nominalized subordinate clause unmarked for case:
A typical example for such constructions is an infinitival subordinate
clause which is an argument of the matrix verb iste 'want'. Such
infinitival complements can be marked overtly for accusative case, but
they can also appear without case marking:
(1411)Hasani [ 0i yan~ -1
kamn -mak] isH -yor
Hasan
race -Ace. win
-Inf.
want -Pr .Prog.
""Hasan wants to win the race""While the infinitival verb can be separated from the matrix verb by a
variety of elements when the infinitival clause is marked for accusative
(and thus behaves like other infinitivals when marked for case overtly,
as discussed in the previous section), it is not possible to interpose
elements (with the exception of emphatic and scope-marking particles)
between the infinitive not marked for case, as in the last example, and
the matrix verb:
(1412)*[ 0i yarl~ -1
kazan -mak] HASAN i sti
-yor
-Inf.
Hasan
want -Pr .Prog.
race -Ace. win
Intended reading: ""HASAN wants to win the race""In this respect, the infinitive not marked for case behaves like
incorporated nouns which are nonspecific and are not marked for case
(cf. 2. 1. 3. 6. 12. 1. 1.-3.).",[439]
