"5. Descriptive wordsA number of Macro-Jê languages—including Karajá--are traditionally described as
presenting an active-stative verb agreement system to some degree. According to Fortune &
Fortune (1964) and Maia (1998), Karajá verbs are divided into two different classes, active
and stative, with the latter consisting essentially of predicates which denote adjectival
meanings, the so-called ‘descriptive verbs.’ These predicates take a series of person markers
which partially coincides with the pronominal object markers in transitive verbs, and which
happens to be the same series of possessive prefixes occurring with nouns. A more careful
examination, however, demonstrates that such ‘verbs’ are, in fact, nouns, and that transitivity,
rather than stativity, plays a central role in Karajá grammar.
The case of Karajá (as well as a brief observation of other languages of the stock)
suggests that one must be cautious in analyzing descriptive predicates as verbs in Macro-Jê212languages. In cases in which there are clear criteria to distinguish nouns and verbs,
descriptive predicates tend to behave mostly like nouns. For example, in Karajá a verb must
first be nominalized in order to appear in a descriptive predicate. Consequently, one must
also be cautious in relying on the behavior of descriptive predicates as a sole criterion to
propose active-stative systems.
Predicative and attributive adjectives are among the lesser known aspects of Macro-Jê
languages. According to the descriptions available, in all Macro-Jê languages the ‘adjective’
would follow the noun (Rodrigues 1999: 193). Since most Macro-Jê languages are SOV, the
position of the adjective in these languages would constitute a systematic counter-example to
Greenberg’s implicational universals, according to which adjectives would tend to precede
the modified noun in SOV languages (Greenberg 1966). However, since most such
descriptions do not give clear evidence for the existence of adjectives as an independent part
of speech, the apparently exceptional nature of adjectives in Macro-Jê may well be just
another undesirable result of what one might call ‘translation-based linguistic analysis.’
That is certainly the case of Karajá, also traditionally described as having postposed
adjectives (Maia 1998: 32). However, a careful analysis of the Karajá data clearly
demonstrates that words denoting adjectival meanings in this language are abstract nouns
whose behavior is identical to that of obligatorily possessed nouns—i.e., corresponding to
attributive constructions such as the angry man, Karajá presents a genitive construction, the
man’s anger. This implies that, instead of occurring as a modifier, the “adjectival” word
would be, in fact, the head of the noun phrase, a phenomenon documented in languages such
as Aleut (Sadock 2000), but commonly overlooked when considering Lowland South
American languages.","[223, 224]"

morphology, and syntax (as well as its peculiar system of gender deixis) remain to be
thoroughly understood. However, even a succinct overview of the language reveals a
number of phenomena rich in theoretical and descriptive implications. It is my hope that this
dissertation will provide us with a better understanding not only of the Karajá language, but
also of the general analytical questions its study raises. The following chapters provide an in
depth description of phenomena which are central to the understanding of Karajá.
Chapter 1 provides a thorough account of the language’s phonological inventory,
syllable and stress patterns, and morphophonology. A major difference between the account
given here and those offered in previous sources lies in the vocalic inventory: here it is
shown that the feature [ATR] ‘advanced tongue root’ plays a central role in Karajá
phonology, as evidenced by a pervasive process of vowel harmony--the first of this kind ever
described for a South American language. [ATR]-ness is also relevant in describing the
second-most common morphophonemic process in the language, palatalization.
Reduplication, maybe the most phonologically-oriented of all word-formation processes, will
also be treated in this chapter.
Chapter 2 deals with an oft-mentioned—yet poorly understood—peculiarity of
Karajá: the existence of systematic differences between male and female speech. As
suggested early on by Ehrenreich (1894), female speech is more conservative, male speech69being generally characterized by the deletion of the velar stop /k/. However, although such
‘genderlectal’ differences are often described as being the result of regular phonological
processes, they can have morphological consequences as well—a fact that went unnoticed in
previous descriptions. The chapter also includes an account of male vs. female speech
distinctions in Javaé, where genderlectal variation is much less prominent (Javaé women
speaking what seems to be a relaxed version of the male speech in the other dialects). A
possible explanation for such a situation, based on a well-documented case of language
contact involving the Javaé, is proposed. Hypotheses on the possible diachronic origins of the
male vs. female speech distinctions are also discussed. Contrary to previous suggestions,
according to which they would be contact-induced (Rodrigues 1999, 2004), the facts seem to
favor an explanation in terms of the language’s own internal historical tendencies.
Chapter 3 describes the language’s word-formation strategies, including, in addition
to morphology proper (that is, the combination of roots and affixes), the use of particles and
clitics. Verb morphology is where most of Karajá’s grammatical complexity lies: the verb
inflects for person (with portmanteau morphemes which also indicate mood), direction
(which also play evidential functions), and voice (transitive, passive, and antipassive),
besides incorporating object pronouns and nouns (sometimes with classificatory purposes).
Tense and aspect are conveyed by clitics and particles, respectively. As in many other
lowland South American languages, nouns, postpositions, and (to a lesser extent) verbs share
person-marking paradigms. Comparative evidence plays an important role in explaining
less-than-transparent morphological devices, such as linking prefixes (which, as it turns out,
are cognates with similar prefixes in other Macro-Jê languages), synchronically invariable
roots with fossilized prefixes, and a non-concatenative mechanism to derive nouns from70verbs. The latter constitute an unusual case of replacive infixation, which, thanks to
comparative evidence, can be traced back to the affixation of a nominalizing suffix.
Chapter 4 deals with complex sentences. Subordinate clauses in Karajá are always the
result of sentential nominalizations, not only in the cases of relative and complement clauses,
but of adverbial clauses as well. It is here claimed that adverbs in Karajá do not exist as an
independent part-of-speech (or, at least, constitute a marginal part-of-speech with very few
members), adverbial functions being played by postpositional phrases. Consequently,
adverbial clauses are postpositional clauses, marked by the same postpositions which mark
nouns. Their use as subordination markers mirrors their use with nouns, even in the case of
converbs—by far, the most common type of subordinate clauses--, which are marked by a
locative postposition. Considering the role they play with adverbial clauses, postpositions are
described in this chapter. A case of discourse (rather than grammatical) subordination, the
=dokuri clause, will also be described in this chapter.
The last chapter, Chapter 5, provides an appraisal of the evidence for the inclusion of
Karajá in the Macro-Jê stock, taking into consideration additional evidence uncovered by the
present study, informed by recent improvements in the reconstruction of Proto-Jê (Ribeiro
2005). Although a relationship between Karajá and the Jê family had been suggested early
by von den Steinen (1884), Karajá was one of the last languages to be included in the MacroJê stock (Davis 1968). As its late inclusion in the stock suggests, the similarities between
Karajá and other Macro-Jê languages are far from obvious. The evidence presented by Davis,
however, is being further corroborated by additional data, as this chapter hopefully
demonstrates. Especially compelling for the hypothesis of genetic relationship are those
instances in which comparative evidence helps explain synchronic irregularities of Karajá, as71in the case of the replacive infix. The chapter demonstrates the interplay between descriptive
and historical linguistics: on the one hand, it shows how a better descriptive knowledge of a
language may contribute to uncover additional pieces of comparative evidence; on the other,
it shows how a better comparative knowledge may contribute to improve our understanding
of synchronic phenomena.","[78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83]"
"538.3.5.2.3AntipassiveAntipassive is a phenomenon typical of ergative languages, corresponding
functionally to a ‘mirror image’ of the passive construction in nominative-accusative
languages (Silverstein 1976). In a syntactically ergative language, “while the A and the O in
an ergative clause are marked as ergative and absolutive respectively, the A in an antipassive
is typically coded as an absolutive NP, and the O (if present) appears in a case other than the
absolutive” (Cooreman 1994: 50).17 Although some authors, such as Cooreman, limit the
discussion of antipassive constructions to ergative languages, nominative-accusative
languages may also present backgrounding antipassives, which “function to demote the
undergoer to peripheral status” (Foley and Van Valin 1985: 338). This is what occurs in
Karajá, where antipassive, marked by the prefix O-, results in the deletion of an unknown or
irrelevant direct object:(59)d-a)dI

Antipassives in Karajá are used to suppress an irrelevant, unknown, or undetermined
object. Common examples involve typical activities such as ‘to clear (a garden)’:(35)idZoi wobaèdI∅-r-O-laSiurEèkre

3-CTFG-ANTI-clear=FUT
‘The guys will clear [the garden] with axes.’
At least one intransitive stem, -ObrO, seems to have resulted from reanalysis of aformerly transitive stem including the antipassive marker, as suggested by the existence of an
allomorph without the initial vowel (brO; cf. also the nominal form, a-l-ObrO-da ‘plant’). As196the example below shows, -ObrO ‘to plant’ is an intransitive, intrinsically antipassive verb,
which needs to be transitivized in order for it to occur with objects:40(36)warikOrEwadEkErIkOrOm´)Îawa-rikOrE

Although the antipassive was not described by previous authors, it is commonly
found in both narrative and descriptive texts, commonly being used in contexts such as the
one above, in which an antipassive form of the verb is later followed by a transitive one,
specifying the object. Another example, from a traditional tale, is provided below. The
sentences are part of a passage in which two young men, returning to their village, hear
someone pounding something with a mortar. At first, the verb TÈ is given in an antipassive
form, later followed by a transitive one:(37)id´)

of direct object prefixes coincides partially with the series occuring with nouns and
descriptive predicates. Pronominal subjects of transitive and intransitive predicates are
expressed by free pronouns (dIkar´) ‘I’, kai ‘you’, Î´kI ‘he, she, it’).","[206, 207, 208, 209]"

‘I will come.’The system of directional markers in Karajá presents characteristics that traditionally
define an inflectional category, such as obligatoriness, semantic and formal regularity, and
productivity (Anderson 1985:163; Bauer 1988:73-87; Bybee 1985:11). The existence of
direction as an inflectional category seems to be a fairly rare phenomenon. Talmy
(1985:135), for example, in a survey of grammatical categories, states categorically that
direction “is not marked inflectionally.” According to Bybee, this would be due to its lack of
lexical generality:By definition, an inflectional category must be applicable to all stems of the appropriate semantic
and syntactic category and must obligatorily occur in the appropriate syntactic context. In order
for a morphological process to be so general, it must have only minimal semantic content. If a
semantic element has high content, i.e. is very specific, it simply will not be applicable to a large
number of stems. [Bybee 1985:16-17]That is, since the category of direction would in principle be relevant only for motion
verbs, it would not apply to a sufficient number of verbs to constitute an inflectional
category. Thus, besides being commonly expressed lexically such as in Portuguese levar ‘to
take away’ versus trazer ‘to bring’ and English come versus go, and by clitics, direction is
also found expressed derivationally, such as in Latin eo¤ ‘I go’, ex-eo¤ ‘I go out’, trans-eo¤ ‘I go
across.’ However, as Bybee (op. cit., 17) observes, “each of these prefixes has a limited175lexical applicability, for they are only appropriately added to verbs indicating motion of some
sort. Their semantic content prevents them from meeting one of the criteria for inflectional
status.”
Bybee’s predictions apply well to languages such as Georgian, for example, where
the opposition between the particles mo ‘hither’ and mi ‘thither’ seems to be productive only
with lexemes denoting some sort of “notional direction towards a goal” (Manning
1996:250).33 However, in Karajá all verbs inflect for direction, including those that
apparently do not indicate a motion at all, such as UrU ‘to die’ (2) and EkÈw´TE ‘to get tired’
(3), as shown by the examples below:(4)a.b.rurure

also used for other purposes. Analyzing the use of the directional markers in narrative texts,
this section explores the hypothesis that directional inflection can be used to show empathy
relationships between the participants of the speech act and between narrator and characters33The grammatical category expressed by the opposition between the particles mo and mi is called ‘orientation’
in Georgian linguistics, whereas the term ‘direction’ is used to refer to another grammatical category, which
“consists of a multi-term system of preverbs, arranged in opposed doublets such as ‘in’ versus ‘out,’ ‘up’ versus
‘down,’ etc.” (Manning, op. cit., 250) The use of the term ‘direction’ in this paper coincides with Talmy’s (op.
cit., 135) definition: “[Direction] refers to whether the Figure in a Motion event is moving toward or away from
the speaker.”
176in a narrative text, playing a role similar to what in other languages may be performed by
obviation systems, evidentials, or attitude markers.
Centrifugal direction (‘thither’) is clearly the unmarked member of the
centrifugal/centripetal opposition. Not only it can, under certain circumstances, be marked
by a zero prefix, but it is also overwhelmingly more common in narrative and descriptive
texts and everyday verbal interactions. Descriptive predicates, marked with auxiliary clitics
which present directional markers, are always marked for centrifugal direction. Furthermore,
verbs in the imperfective (marked by the clitic èr-a) cannot inflect for centripetal direction
(an exception which remains to be explained) and there seem to be pragmatic restrictions as
to the occurrence of centripetal marking with verbs in the progressive (marked with the
auxiliary clitic èr-ErI). As we will see (Section 2.2.2), such restrictions demonstrate that
direction can clearly be used with evidential purposes.","[186, 187, 188]"

In most languages where there are distinctions such as the ones between i-class stems
and Î-class stems, postpositions are also divided between both classes. That may also have
been the case in Karajá. Notice that all suppletive third-person forms begin with /Î/,
suggesting that such ‘pronouns’ are relics of Î-class postpositional paradigms. Notice also
that, if this theory is correct, a second-person form corresponding to ÎU would have been
*∅-U; that may be the origin of the second-person prefix U- mentioned above.
Karajá does not seem to have adverbs as an independent part-of-speech, adverbial
functions being performed by postpositional phrases. Consequently, corresponding to
adverbial clauses, Karajá presents nominalized clauses occurring as objects of postpositions.
Example (72) below illustrates the use of the comitative postposition èwada) to form
conditional clauses (example from the Xambioá dialect). Given the importance of
postpositions in forming adverbial subordinate clauses, their semantics will be further
described in Chapter 5.","[72, 73]"

Kariri, a Macro-Jê language remotely related to Karajá, also has an evitative postposition (Mamiani 1877:77).

Talmy (1985:129), who defines figure as “the salient moving or stationary object in a motion event” and path as
a category which “refers to the variety of paths followed, or sites occupied, by the Figure object.”

Although the range of meanings displayed by some of the Karajá pospositions may at first seem unusual, it is
very easy to find parallels in other, well-known languages such as English or Portuguese. The use of locative
postpositions with temporal purposes (as a metaphorical extension from location in space to location in time),
226name, think and tell (that is, the complements denoting that which is said, heard, thought,
asked, or told) are also marked by the postposition èb´) (15). As we will see, this semantic
diversity accounts for the use of this postposition to mark both purpose clauses and converbs,
as well as sentential complements of verbs such as say, tell, etc.6(11)♂a-r-∅-aèkre

for example, is a rather common phenomenon. Even more idiosyncratic uses of postpositions (as non-canonical
markers of what would be translated as direct objects in English) may also reflect cross-linguistic tendencies.
As Jespersen (1965:159) points out, verbs for ‘to throw’ take objects marked as instrumentals in many
languages, including Old Norse. The use of a locative posposition to mark the object of a verb such as ♀ rakuSi
‘to eat’ (♂ roSi) is paralleled in English by the use of on in constructions such as deer feed on grass or the
castaway lived on coconuts for weeks.

This apparent diversity of meanings could be due not to polysemy, but to homophony (that is, instead of these
being instances of different meanings associated with a single postposition, it could be the case that there would
be different postpositions with the same phonological shape). However, the fact that a postposition such as èb´)
presents the same irregular allomorphy in all the uses mentioned above seems to rule out the hypothesis of
accidental similarity.
227In addition to the paradigmatic peculiarities and wide range of semantic uses, the
‘diffuse locative’ postposition, èb´), presents some distributional peculiarities. As illustrated
by (16) below, in which èb´) occurs as a purpose marker, it can follow other postpositions (in
this case, the ‘static locative’ èkI). [The example also illustrates the use of the dative
postposition, èd´kE ~ èdEE, with benefactive functions.](16)wa-dEE

‘Watch out for me!’ (lit. ‘[It is] for [it to be] in your eyes for me.’)Another characteristic which sets èb´) apart from all the remaining postpositions is its

have objects marked by oblique postpositions in Karajá. For example, the verb -obi ‘to see’
takes objects marked by the locative postposition èb´) (18); -ehu ‘to throw’ takes228complements marked by the instrumental postposition èdI (19); -aha ‘to find’ takes
complements marked by the locative postpositions ètSi or èkI (20).7 The verb ♀ rakuSi ‘to
eat’ (♂ roSi), although marked by the prefix I-, which generally occurs with transitive verbs,
takes objects marked by the posposition èb´) (21).8(18)kai

"2.2 Temporal constructions7As in English or Portuguese, the verb aha ‘to find’ is also used with an ‘evaluative’ meaning (as in I found the
play annoying). In this case, the evaluative phrase is marked by the postposition èb´):

229The semantics of some postpositions can be further illustrated by their use in
temporal constructions. In addition to the temporal postposition proper, èku, locative èb´)
and instrumental èdI were also attested in temporal uses: rukuèb´) ‘at night’, rukuèdI ‘at
dawn’; bikuraTOèku ‘in the morning’, bikuraTOèb´) ‘tomorrow’; etc. The use of èdI
‘instrumental’ in rukuèdI ‘at dawn’ (literally, ‘after night’) mirrors its use with subordinate
clauses such as (22) below:(22)k´-d-∅-EhEb´)d´)èkreèdI
a-r-∅-aèkre
3-CTPT-INTR-arrive=FUTèINSTR 1-CTFG-go=FUT
‘After he arrives, I will go.’3. Relative clausesFor the sake of terminological clarity, I will adopt here the basic terminology
employed by Keenan (1985). Like Keenan, I regard relative clauses to be full NPs (a fact that
is rather clear in Karajá, where relative clauses can take articles, as we have seen, and
postpositions, as it will be shown below). As Keenan points out, a relative clause typically
consists of a common noun (or a pronoun), the domain noun, optionally accompanied by
determiners, and a restrictive clause: “Semantically the common noun determines a class of
objects, which we shall call the domain of relativization, and the restrictive clause identifies a
subset of the domain, those elements which satisfy the conditions given by the restrictive
clause” (Keenan 1985: 142). Thus, in Îori dOrOède! ‘a White man who arrived’, Îori ‘White
man’ is the domain noun, and dOrOède! ‘who arrived’ is the restrictive clause.
As we have seen, the only surface difference between the independent clause in (1)
and its subordinate counterpart in (2) is in the location of the stress: [Îo""ri do""rode] ‘the White230man came ashore’ versus [Îo""ri doro""de] ‘the White man who came ashore’. In fact, stress
shift is the basic mechanism to mark the subordinate status of relative clauses that modify
core NPs (that is, subjects and direct objects). That the subordinate clause occupies the
position of an NP is further demonstrated by the fact that it can be followed by the enclitic
indefinite article ♀ èdo), ♂ èo) (24), which attaches to the rightmost element of an NP (23). In
addition, an NP modified by a subordinate clause can still act as a possessor, and, in these
cases, the possessed noun will occur after the subordinate clause (25).9 Notice that the
relative clause is postnominal, occurring after the modified noun. This fact, as we will see
(Section 6), reflects the general distribution of modifiers in attributive constructions.","[240, 241, 242]"

‘You ate the food that I brought.’
When an oblique domain noun is separated from the relative clause, notice that the
postposition marking the oblique NP occurs twice—with both the domain noun and the
subordinate clause. That is, the stranded relative clause agrees in case with the domain noun:(33)iwErUèb´)

2-mother3.2 Pronoun retaining strategiesIn the previous sections, we concentrate on the syntactic properties of the domain
nouns. In this section, attention will be given to the relativized position—that is, the position
in the relative clause which is co-referential with the domain noun. In all the examples of
relative clauses presented so far, the relativized position corresponds to a core argument of
the subordinate clause—either the subject, as in (32), or the direct object, as in (33). As these
examples show, there is no surface indication of which position is relativized, which is
indicated by gapping—that is, the relativized NP is simply absent from the relative clause.
This lack of explicit indication of which position is relativized may lead to ambiguity when
one has a third-person transitive verb with a third-person object. Thus, in both examples
below, the relativized position may be interpreted as being either the subject or the direct
object of the subordinate clause:(34)♂ha)wÈÈèb´)

3-CTFG-INTR-arrive-VERB=CTFG-PROGR
‘The woman who hit the man is arriving’
or ‘the man who hit the woman is arriving.’235Subject and direct objects are the positions which tend to be more easily relativizable
cross-linguistically, when compared with other syntactic positions. The hierarchy of which
positions are more likely to allow relativization is thus summarized by Keenan and Comrie
(1977):(36)Keenan and Comrie’s (1977) Accessibility Hierarchy:Subject > Direct Object > Indirect Object > Object of Adposition > Possessor
While subject and direct object relativized positions are not marked in Karajá,
relativized positions occupying a lower position in the accessibility hierarchy are marked by
a third-person pronominal form. That is, relativization of any syntactic position besides
subject and direct object is accomplished through pronoun retaining strategies. This is the
case for objects of all the postpositions (including the dative, which behaves as any other
oblique NP in the language, and objects of comparison), as well as possessors. Below are
examples of relativized locative (37), ablative (38), and genitive (39) positions:(37)kai

The example below further illustrates a pronoun-retaining relative clause, involving
the object of the verb -ehu ‘to throw, to shoot’, which is marked with the instrumental
posposition èdI. Notice that the clitic èle ‘only’, which generally attaches to the right edge
of a noun phrase, occurs after the subordinate verb:(40)biuraèO

‘Only the one [the wax-tipped arrow] he had shot towards east was melted.’3.3 Possible origins of the ‘subordinating accent’As we have seen, stress shift plays an important role in subordination in Karajá. This
device—which we may call ‘subordinating accent’—is reminiscent of the ‘definite accent’ in
Tonga, described by Anderson (1992: 212) as an example of non-affixal clitic. In this
language, according to Anderson, “the normal location of stress is on (the syllable
containing) the penultimate mora. A sort of definiteness is marked by a stress shift to the
final mora of the entire NP.” In this case, the stress shift is explained as being the reflex of a
demonstrative morpheme *a which would have existed diachronically.","[245, 246, 247, 248]"
"3.1 Personal pronounsThere are three independent personal pronouns in Karajá: ♀ dIkar´) (♂ dIar´)) ‘I’, kai
‘you’, and Î´kI (♂ ÎII) ‘he, she, it’. All of them can be pluralized by the pluralizer boho,
which also occurs with nouns. The plural form of the 1st person pronoun has an exclusive
reading (51). For an inclusive 1st person plural reading, the noun id´) ‘human, Karajá’ is used
with the pluralizer boho. The verb, in such cases, is generally inflected for third person,206except in the centrifugal direction of the irrealis mood, when the verb occurs with the prefixr´k- (52):(51)(52)dI´r´) boho k´ÎUraa-r-I-rOèrEd´)èkreI

Morphology
1. Introduction
This chapter describes Karajá’s word-formation strategies, including, in addition to
morphology proper (that is, the combination of roots and affixes), the use of particles and
clitics. Most of the chapter will be devoted to verb morphology, which is where most of
Karajá’s grammatical complexity lies: the verb inflects for person (with portmanteau
morphemes which also indicate mood), direction (which also play evidential functions), and
voice (transitive, passive, and antipassive), besides incorporating object pronouns and nouns
(sometimes with classificatory purposes). Tense and aspect are conveyed by clitics and
particles, respectively. As in many other lowland South American languages, nouns,
postpositions, and (to a lesser extent) verbs share person-marking paradigms. Since
postpositions have already been described in Chapter 1, and their semantic and syntactic
characteristics will be further discussed in Chapter 5, they will not be dealt with in this
chapter. Section 2 describes the inflectional properties of verbs. Section 3 deals with the
inflectional properties of nouns and briefly discusses the small class of personal pronouns,
outlining their main differences in relation to nouns. Section 4 discusses derivational
morphology, describing processes used to create new noun (Section 4.1) and verb (4.2)
stems.
Karajá, like most (if not all) Macro-Jê languages, lacks adjectives as an independent
part of speech. In languages lacking adjectives, their functions tend to be expressed by nouns
or verbs. The tendency, in Macro-Jê studies, has been to describe ‘descriptives’ (i.e., words
expressing adjectival functions) as verbs, an interpretation which has also been proposed for172Karajá (Fortune 1973, Maia 1986). Section 5 describes the morphological and syntactic
properties of such descriptive words, demonstrating that, contrary to previous claims, they
are indeed nouns.","[182, 183, 184]"
"3.4. Exceptions, obligatoriness, and variation142Although it is a very productive process, applying even to loanwords, there are a few
exceptions to the k-dropping rule. These are mainly grammatical words, such as the personal
pronoun kai ‘you’, the demonstratives ka ‘this’, kua ‘that (far from both the speaker and the
addressee)’, and kia ‘that (close to the addressee)’, the locative postposition èkI, the verb
particles èk´re ‘future marker’ and èkE ‘potential marker’, and discourse markers, such as
èr´kI ‘narrative’. I am not aware of any noun or verb roots constituting absolute exceptions
to the k-dropping rule.
Although the previous studies do mention the existence of such exceptions, they fail
to notice a very remarkable fact. Even among the words for which the k-dropping rule is
possible there are differences concerning the degree of obligatoriness with which the
differentiation takes place. That is, while for some words k-dropping is obligatory, for others
it is optional. According to this criterion, words presenting a velar stop may be classed into
three different categories: (a) absolute exceptions, that is, words for which the deletion of /k/
does not occur at all; (b) words for which the k-dropping rule is optional; (c) words for which
the k-dropping rule is obligatory.13 Tables 3, 4, and 5 below show examples of members of
each class:Table 3.3. Class a: absolute exceptions to the rule of k-dropping

ruÎǨThat these differences do not relate to criteria such as morphological status or part-ofspeech is shown by the fact that each of the three subject pronouns behaves in a different
way. For the first person pronoun, k-dropping is obligatory: ♀ dIkar´), ♂ dIar´). The second
person pronoun, kai, belongs to the small class of absolute exceptions. Finally, for the third
person pronoun, Î´kI, k-dropping is optional. The same assumption is also valid for the
postpositions: while the locative postposition èkI belongs to Class a, the dative postpositiond´kE belongs to Class b, and the temporal postposition èku to Class c. Finally, the same
differences in behavior occur with affixes: although k-dropping is obligatory with the first
person irrealis prefix ka-, it is optional with the third person irrealis prefix k´-.
Furthermore, the k-dropping rule does not apply equally to all the occurrences of the
velar stop in a given word. If two adjacent syllables in the same word contain a /k/, the144tendency is that only one of its occurrences will be deleted, generally the first one: ♀ kOka
‘to shred’ (♂ Oka); ♀ kukO ‘to lift’ (♂ ukO). It is plausible that at least some of these
restrictions are due to phonological constraints, such as to limit the number of vowels in a
row. Also, at least some cases of obligatory male-female speech differentiation can be stated
in phonological terms. Thus, the velar stop seems to be always deleted when occurring
before /u/. Thus, in the male speech form corresponding to ♀ kowoku ‘mortar’, k-dropping
is obligatory in the last syllable, but optional in the first (♂ kowo, owo).14 The deletion of
the velar stop seems to be generally optional in the cases described in section 2.1.2, which
involve schwa assimilation. On the other hand, differentiation is always obligatory in the
cases described in section 2.1.1 above, in which vowel fusion takes place (♀ bEraku ‘river’,
♂ bero), and in section 2.1.3, involving epenthesis (♀ ikOrO ‘fox’, ♂ idZOrO). Thus, the
differentiation between male and female speech seems to be obligatory exactly in those cases
in which the differences between the words in both gender dialects are more salient.
Some morphemes seem to be on the borderline between Class a and Class b. That is
the case of the ‘augmentative’ morpheme -hVk´), which generally preserves the velar stop in
the male speech, such as in ♀ berohok´) [river-big] ‘great river (the Araguaia)’, ♂bErakuhuk´). Although this morpheme may occasionally occur without the velar stop in the
speech of some individuals, this is very sporadic, and considered wrong by the majority of
the speakers. Therefore, although the classification suggested here accounts for the behavior14Therefore, examples such as kowoku ‘mortar’ belong simultaneously to classes b and c.
145of most of the Karajá lexicon, one has to keep in mind the influence of factors such as
hypercorrection in the performance of individual speakers and the impact analogy may have
had in the development of such distinctions.
Thus, there is a great deal of variation in the pronunciation of Class b words, not only
among different speakers, but even in the speech of the same individual. A good example of
the variation in the use of Class b words occurs in the examples below, from a text narrated
by a Northern Karajá man, in which both forms of the verb Î´ka ‘to tie’ occur in the same
sequence:(16)Îar´kI´n´)SiwEirOdU dErarIÎ´kare,Îaèr´kI

‘Then Kynyxiwè tied the arms of the animals, and tied the deer with a rope.’
Therefore, forms such as Î´ka should be better considered as neutral in terms of
female versus male speech distinctions, since they do not necessarily indicate anything about
the sex of the speaker. Thus, while (17a) is clearly a female speech form and (17b) is clearly
a male speech form, (17c) can occur in the speech of both males and females. Thus, male
speech is characterized by a higher degree of variation, which is not available in the female
speech.","[153, 154, 155, 156, 157]"

2206. Final remarksThis chapter described the morphology of Karajá, focusing especially on the
inflectional and derivational properties of nouns and verbs. A thorough description of verb
and noun morphology makes it possible to determine the morphosyntactic position of
‘descriptives’, i.e. lexemes that denote adjectival meanings. Contrary to previous analyses
(Fortune 1973, Maia 1986), the description provided here demonstrates that descriptives are
in fact nouns. A conclusive proof of their nominal nature is the fact that, in order to be used
as a descriptive word, a verb must be first nominalized, which is particularly clear in cases
for which nominalization is indicated by consonantal replacement.","[231, 232]"

èkO can occur with both [+animate] and [-animate] nouns. Because of this semantic constraint, èd´kE occurs
more frequently in functions that are traditionally associated with that of datives. As mentioned above, kO does
not take prefixes. Thus, corresponding to both postpositions, there is only one set of inflected forms: wa-d´kE

(either because of their highly polysemic nature, or because of the semantic subtleties that
differentiate them). A brief explanation of the meanings most commonly associated with
some of them shall be helpful in understanding their use with subordinate clauses.
The evitative postposition indicates what is to be avoided or feared, marking the
oblique complements of verbs such as -UbErU ‘to be freightened’ (4) and wO ‘to hide’.3 An
example of the temporal postposition (‘when’) is given in (5) below. Besides indicating
source (‘from’), the ablative postposition marks objects of comparison (6).","[235, 236]"

intransitive verbs, such as uÎǨÎǨ ‘to become cold’, are marked by a zero prefix, whereasi-class intransitive verbs, such as ÎOÎ´kE ‘to become hot’, are marked by the prefix a-:(37)a.b´dE

immediately preceded by a pronominal direct object or an incorporated noun, the relational
prefix l- is used (38b):
14This is a denominal verb derived from -UahI ‘medicine’. It is tempting to consider the prefix Î- occurring
with transitive verbs as simply a marker of 3rd person object. However, this prefix also occurs with antipassive
constructions (54), which do not allow explicit direct objects.

nouns, of different degrees of grammatical possession: there are obligatorily-possessed nouns
(e.g. body-part terms, for instance), optionally-possessed nouns (e.g cultural items), and
nouns which cannot be directly possessed (e.g. items of nature, such as rocks, water, animals,
etc.). That is a well-documented phenomenon in several Macro-Jê languages, including
those of the Boróro, Jê, and Karirí families (Rodrigues 1999:190-192). In the latter case (that
is, items which cannot be directly possessed), generic nouns such as the ones described above
are used as possessive classifiers in indirect possessive constructions, such as 43 below, from
Boróro (Crowell 1977:178). In Karajá, however, that is not the case, as any noun can in
principle be directly possessed (wa-idZOrOTa ‘my dog’, etc.).","[54, 55, 56]"

‘The one who brings food is coming ashore.’26Both ÎEhE ‘to watch, to look at’ and ehu ‘to throw’ take objects marked by the instrumental postposition èdI

258Verb nouns can also be used as (notional) modifiers of other nouns, both as predicates
(93a) or attributes (93b). Notice that constructions such as Î´kÈ TUrO can be translated as
‘washed clothes’ or ‘the clothes’ washing’, being structurally identical to genitive phrases.
Notice that the location of the relative clause mirrors the location of the modifier in simple
attributive constructions.","[269, 270]"
"5. Language contact and the ‘Xavánte hypothesis’The development of male and female speech distinctions such as the ones occurring
in Karajá may, in several cases, be the result of situations of language contact.24 The
classical example of such a situation occurs in the so-called Island-Carib language (Arawak),
mentioned as early as the 17th century. According to Jespersen (1964:237), “[T]he first to
mention their distinct sex dialects was the Dominican Breton, who, in his Dictionnaire24Although phenomena such as pronoun borrowing and male vs. female speech distinctions are generally
discussed in reference to ‘exotic’ languages, both can be illustrated by a case of borrowing in Portuguese. In
[Brazilian] Portuguese, French moi is commonly used informally, mainly in a sort of tongue-in-cheek register.
My impression as a native speaker (corroborated by internet searches and consultations with other native
speakers) is that such usage of moi is essentially restricted to female speech, illustrating how males and females
may be more or less receptive to language innovations.
159Caraïbe-français (1664), says that the Caribbean chief had exterminated all the natives
except the women, who had retained part of their ancient language.” The women preserved
their Arawakan language, adopted later by the Kariban conquerors, who retained elements of
their original language in their speech—giving origin to what came to be called the ‘men’s
language.’25 Jespersen views this theory with suspicion, and tries to explain such differences
as a result of language taboo. However, in spite of Jespersen’s skepticism, more recent
studies have given further support to the traditional explanation. According to Taylor &
Hoff, “it is impossible to explain the available linguistic data unless one accepts the native
tradition that indeed there has been such an invasion”:The language that is called the women’s language by Breton, but which actually was and is
the native language of both sexes, is a typical Arawakan language […]. The lexicon is
Arawakan too, except that it contains a rather large proportion of borrowed Carib (Karina)
lexemes: about twenty-two percent of the basic vocabulary. Over and above these loanwords
adopted by the common tongue, the so-called men’s language contained a large number of
lexemes and some grammatical morphemes of Carib (Karina) provenance, the latter being
insufficient to formulate most simple sentences without admixture of inherited Arawakan
grammatical morphemes. [Taylor and Hoff 1980:301]Another case in which language contact may have played a role in the genesis of male
versus female speech distinctions is Kokama, a language spoken in lowland Peru. Kokama is
traditionally classified as a Tupí-Guaraní language. However, Cabral (1995) argues that
“Kokama cannot even be classified genetically because its linguistic subsystems do not find
correlates in a single language or linguistic family source.” Through a comparison with
Tupinambá (Tupí-Guaraní), a language assumed to have been the lexifier of Kokama, Cabral
shows that “except for lexical similarities and a number of sound correspondences, Kokama
differs greatly from the Tupinambá language in its phonology, morphology and syntax,25According to Taylor & Hoff (op. cit.:302), the Island-Carib male speech is “virtually extinct today.”
160though the latter is the source of a significant portion of the vocabulary of the former.”
Cabral suggests, as a likely historical scenario for the development of Kokama, the Jesuit
missionary villages, where speakers of languages of different families (including Arawakan
and Panoan) had to learn Kokama, the official language of the missions, “in this process
failing to learn the Tupí-Guaraní language as a whole.” Among the non-Tupian features
found in Kokama, Cabral (op. cit.:285) mentions the existence of differences between male
and female speech in the pronominal system, which “is neither a Tupian feature nor a feature
characteristic of the other native languages that we know the Kokama speakers have had
some contact with during the last 400 years.” Interestingly, the female pronominal forms are
mostly of Tupian origin, whereas the male forms are mostly non-Tupian. The explanation
Cabral suggests for the origin of such differentiations lies in the situation of intense language
contact:This gender distinction found in Kokama could be either a feature created in a contact
situation where a social distinction based on sex and ethnicity was called for, or it could have
developed as an extension of a feature found in the non-Tupian language(s) participating in
the development of Kokama. This extension could well have been caused by the contact
situation itself, where mixing of Indian groups with significant proportions of males from one
ethnicity and females from another could be a favorable situation for the development of
speaker sex distinctions in linguistic forms. [Cabral 1995:287-88]In Island-Carib and Kokama, the role of language contact in the development of male
versus female speech distinctions seems to be quite straightforward, since males and females
use lexemes of distinct genetic sources. That is a very different situation from what happens
in Karajá, where, as we have seen, males and females share the same lexical items (with the
exception of a few interjections), the differences between both speeches being simply a result
of fairly regular phonological processes. However, Rodrigues (1999) suggests for Karajá a
scenario very similar to what may have happened in Island-Carib:
161Perhaps in the past the women of one dialectal group of Karajá could have been subjugated by
warriors speaking another language, say one lacking velar stops but having glottal stops.
Such warriors could have killed all Karajá male adults, taken their place as husbands and
learned the Karajá language from their new wives, but substituted their glottal stops for the
velar stops of the women. This bad pronunciation by the new masters of the group would
then have been maintained through the following generations and spread to other dialectal
groups. In the course of time, the articulation of the glottal stop would have weakened and
finally disappeared, giving place to vowel sequences and contractions. […] It happens that
the neighboring language Xavánte has historically undergone the systematic change of velar
consonants into glottal stops. […] This language, which does not show a similar difference
correlated with the sex of the speakers, may well be the source of the difference between
Karajá men’s and women’s speech. [Rodrigues 1999:177-8]26This imaginative hypothesis runs into a series of obstacles, the main one being that it
presupposes a rather intimate situation of language contact, which would presumably have
had a more pervasive impact on the Karajá language—including a number of borrowings,
such as observed in Island-Carib and Kokama. However, a lexical comparison between
Karajá and Xavánte has of yet not revealed a single clear case of Xavánte loanwords in
Karajá (or vice-versa, for that matter).27
A more damaging piece of evidence against the Xavante hypothesis is provided by
the earliest vocabularies of both languages, collected in the first half of the 19th century.
While the first Karajá vocabulary, collected by Castelnau (1850), already show k-dropping
forms, the first Xavante vocabularies, collected by Pohl (1832) and by Castelnau (1850)
26For a more elaborate version of the ‘Xavánte hypothesis’, see Rodrigues (2002).
I compared an extensive Karajá vocabulary with the Xavánte data published by Hall, McLeod & Mitchell
(1987).","[170, 171, 172, 173]"

‘The birds scattered.’2.6.3 Verbalization of noun-noun compoundsA number of verbs present compound stems which superficially resemble noun
incorporation constructions, but which are actually the result of the verbalization of nounnoun compounds. In some cases, the second element in the noun-noun compound is a
deverbal noun, creating constructions which may look, at first sight, as the result of valencechanging noun incorporation, as in the example below:(46)♂a.biuèkI

3-CTFG-INTR-jatobá-eat-VERB=CONV∅-r-∅-Ud´)èb´)h´)
3-CTFG-INTR-sit=HABIT
‘He sat at the top eating jatobá fruit.’
That ÎO ‘to eat (sweets), suck’ in (46) is in its nominal form (derived by zeroaffixation or conversion) is shown by the fact that it requires the verbalizing suffix -d´). That
is particularly clear when the deverbal noun is derived by consonantal replacement, as in (47)
below, where rÈ is the nominal form of the verb kÈ ‘to eat (grains, bread, etc.)’:(47)♂a-r-a-bolo-r
bolo-rÈÈ-d´)èkre
a-CTFG-INTR-cake-eat-VERB=FUT
‘I will do some cake-eating.’2.6.4 Derivation as incorporation: causative -d
-d´´k´)203All the incorporation constructions described above fit well into the traditional,
Sapirian definition of noun incorporation, since they involve independent noun and verb
stems which can also occur in non-incorporating constructions. I suggest, however, that
Karajá also has a less usual type of incorporation, similar to what has been described by
Sadock for West Greenlandic (Sadock 1980), involving the causativizer -d´k´). As we have
seen, -d´k´) selects only nominal stems, in such a way that, in order to be causativized, a verb
root must first be nominalized. I suggest that -d´k´), although morphologically dependent, is
a noun-incorporating stem.
Such an analysis is particularly appealing if one takes into consideration extended
intransitive verbs, which, as we have seen, take non-canonically marked objects. That is the
case of the verb -ehu ‘to throw’, whose objects are marked with the instrumental postpositionèdI (48a). While, with transitive verbs, the original object cannot be expressed under
causativization, with extended intransitive verbs the original object is preserved with its
original marking, and the original subject (the causée) is expressed as a direct object (48b):(48)a.kUladU m´nadIrehurebOdOIdIkUladU b´)da)èdI

Sadock (i.e., a case of syntactic word-formation) is the fact that the original verb root seems
to preserve some syntactic saliency, still assigning case to its original, non-canonically
marked object.","[213, 214, 215, 216]"
"5.2 HeadshipThe data analyzed here clearly demonstrate that words denoting adjectival concepts in
Karajá are nouns—especially abstract nouns. These nouns present a morphological behavior
identical to obligatorily possessed nouns—i.e., corresponding to attributive constructions
such as the angry man, Karajá presents a possessive construction, the man’s anger. This
would imply that, instead of occurring as a modifier, the “adjectival” word would be, in fact,
the head of the noun phrase. Uncommon as this may seem, such a situation is reminiscent of
what happens in Tupinambá and Aleut, for example.
In Tupinambá, a Tupí-Guaraní language once spoken along the Brazilian coast,
Rodrigues (1996) also treats descriptive words in Tupinambá as nouns; “
Muitos nomes designam qualidades ou estados, tais como orÈ!B ‘alegria’, -asÈ! ‘dor’, -u!n
‘pretume, escuridão’, pira!N ‘vermelhidão’, pora!N ‘beleza’, kane/o) ‘cansaço’, ma/enwa!r

têm sido muitas vezes considerado adjetivos ou verbos descritivos. Entretanto, morfológica e

(Sadock 2000). Sadock describes it as a “highly favored structure in Aleut,” which is
“deployed in a surprising array of formally and semantically distinct cases”, including
genitivization (74), nominal modification (75), and relativization (76).45(74)Aleut (Sadock 2000)

However, according to Sadock (op. cit.), in (41) and (42) “the notional modifier is theformal head of the phrase. […] Despite the formal headship facts, the relative case NP (the
counterpart of a possessor) is the semantic head.” Thus, the relative-anaphoric construction
in Aleut presents a striking similarity with genitive-like constructions in Karajá (and in Jê,
and in Tupí-Guaraní). The distribution of the relative case marker in Aleut in (39)-(41) is
extremely similar to the distribution of relational prefixes in Macro-Jê.","[230, 231]"

Since, as will be shown, processes of syllabic rearrangement played a crucial role in
the development of consonantal replacement in Karajá, a brief description of the syllabic
patterns of both Proto-Jê and Karajá is also necessary. In Macro-Jê, syllabic patterns are
rather simple. As summarized by Rodrigues (1999), clusters “are limited to the combination
of grave (labial and velar) stops followed by a central or a lateral approximant.” This state of
affairs can be reconstructed for Proto-Jê, and is maintained in most Jê languages. Karajá also
presents the same type of clusters (cf. krO ‘toad’, brO ‘back’). However, as shown by a
35As we have seen in Chapter 2, the series of palatal consonants in Karajá is an innovation (resulting from
palatalization of velar, alveolar, and dental consonants around [high, +ATR] vowels). Their status as phonemes
is still questionable.
279comparison with Proto-Jê (and other better-known Macro-Jê languages such as Maxakalí),
old clusters with an initial voiceless stop were systematically simplified in Karajá (Table 8),
losing the initial stop. The process of cluster simplification seems to have affected only
voiceless stops (voiced stops were preserved, as illustrated by likely cognate pairs such as
Proto-Jê *mrOk ‘ash’, Karajá brÈbÈ). Clusters with an initial voiceless stop were later
reintroduced in Karajá through a process of syncope (*k´rO > krO ‘frog’).36Table 6.8. Cluster simplification in Pre-Proto-Karajá

although a few gaps remain. 37 However, for the purposes of the present study, the facts are
clear. Concerning the inventory, the crucial facts are those related to the aforementioned
generalizations about consonant clusters: (a) Karajá /k/, the only voiceless stop in this
language, corresponds to Proto-Jê *k (Proto-Jê *ko ‘wood, horn’ :: Karajá kO; Proto-Jê *ku
‘to eat’:: Karajá kÈ; also ex. 12 and 13); (b) the voiced stop /b/ in Karajá corresponds to
Proto-Jê *m (Proto-Jê *ma ‘liver’ :: Karajá ba; Proto-Jê *ma) ‘dative’, Karajá b´); also ex. 1436Such syllables can still be considered as underlyingly dissyllabic (/k´.rO/), as demonstrated by their behavior
in processes such as reduplication (which, in Karajá, is sensitive to the number of moras).
37
For instance, correspondences involving Proto-Jê *N are still unclear. The two likely cognates involving
Proto-Jê *N we have so far happen to be a homophonous pair: Proto-Jê *NrE ‘egg’ :: Karajá TI; Proto-Jê *NrE ‘to
dance, sing’ :: Karajá U-TI ‘to dance’. Here, Karajá /T/ corresponds to Proto-Jê *Nr, and not only *r, contrary to
what Davis suggests (again, Proto-Jê *r corresponds to /r/ in Karajá: Proto-Jê *rE ‘to leave behind’ :: Karajá rI).
So, both *kr and *Nr are reflected in Karajá as /T/. This suggests that both *k and *N merged as /k/ in Karajá,
although the data do not allow a definite answer at this time, since no clear examples illustrating
correspondences with *N in other positions have been identified so far.
280and 15); (c) Proto-Jê *r corresponds to Karajá /r/ (Proto-Jê *rE ‘to leave behind’ :: Karajá rI;
also ex. 10-13 and 19).
Unlike Karajá, Jê languages allow consonant-final syllables (cf. Proto-Jê *pek ‘fart’,
*t´t ‘hard’, *par ‘foot’, *pra)m ‘hunger’, etc.). Corresponding to a CVC sequence in Jê,
Karajá has two syllables, the cognate vowel showing up at the last one (C´CV). This
apparent change in the position of the vowel is here termed “pseudo metathesis”—“pseudo”
because, as will be shown, the vowel did not change its position at all. The key to this
process is a rather common phenomenon in Macro-Jê--the insertion of so-called “echo
vowels,” which has been documented in at least three families (Jê, Ofayé, and now Karajá;
see the discussion of the schwa as a likely case of dissimilation, in Chapter 2). Although
languages vary as to the inventory of consonants involved (in Ofayé, it only takes place after
/r/: Far ‘foot’ [""FWara/]; in Kaingáng, only after approximants; in Suyá, after all final
consonants), they have one thing in common: a vowel identical with the one in the last
syllable is inserted after the final consonant. In Karajá, the original vowel was then
weakened to a schwa, a process that finds parallels in other Macro-Jê languages. 38 Notice,
however, that if the final consonant is *r, the original vowel is deleted, the result being a
CCV cluster (ex. 18):38A very similar sucession of processes happened in Xerénte (Central Jê), as shown by a comparison with
Proto-Jê and Xavante (the other surviving Central Jê language):

the consonant replacement pattern shown in Table 1. As the correspondences illustrated
above show, it is rather plausible to consider (on phonological and semantic grounds) the
“replacive infix” –r- in Karajá as a cognate of the Jê nominalizer *-r. Its peculiar distribution
can be accounted for by a succession of independently-demonstrable diachronic processes.
This is illustrated below (Table 10) by the Karajá root kÈ ‘to eat’ (nominal form rÈ), a likely
cognate of Proto-Jê *ku (nominal form *ku-r)Table 6.10. From suffix to “replacive infix”

*kÈrÈ
*k´rÈ
*krÈrÈIf the description provided here is correct, we should be able to find elsewhere
(besides those examples involving suffixation of the nominalizer) additional cases in which
final *r came to be in prevocalic position. That is indeed the case: the Karajá cognate of the
Jê verb root *kÈr ‘to call, to bellow’39 is rÈ, displaying exactly the same correspondences
39In this case, the final /r/ is indeed part of the stem, as suggested by Southern Jê (Xokléng kÈl ‘to shout out, to
cry’; Urban 1985:177), where the nominalizer *-r does not occur (cf. also Maxakalí cat ‘to call’; Pereira
282described above (see also Table 9, ex. 18). Examples such as these show that the infixal
location of the nominalizer is a byproduct of regular phonological processes which affected
*r-final stems in general.
Also, if consonant clusters involving voiced stops were indeed preserved in Karajá,
one should be able to find cases in which the nominalizer has been preserved after /b/. That,
in fact, also happens: the nominal form corresponding to the Karajá verb -bU ‘to cry’ is -brU
(cf. Meb. muw ‘to cry’, nominal form muw-r; also compare example 18 in Table 9). Cases
such as *par ‘foot’ :: Karajá wa, where lenition seems to have prevented the creation of an
environment for cluster formation, provide clues on the relative chronology of the
phonological processes postulated herein (*p-lenition must have preceded cluster
formation).403.4.1 Residual examples: h-replacementThere are a few verb stems for which, instead of /k/, it is /h/ that is replaced by /r/ in
the nominal form (Table 11). Except for hO ‘to wash’, 41 all of these stems present, after the
glottal fricative, a front vowel. Thus, it is possible that such cases represent original
instances in which *k preceded a front vowel. The velar stop would have undergone a1992:95). The final consonant was apparently reinterpreted as a suffix in the other branches of the Jê family,
Central and Northern Jê, where the nominalizer –r is still productive.
40
One should not assume, however, that lenition took place simultaneously for *p and *t. As the survival of *k
demonstrates, different consonants (although belonging to the same “natural class”) may behave differently in
processes such as this (and the same applies to cluster simplification). Lenition of *p and *t and cluster
simplification can both be seen as instances of the same tendency (a Sapirian “drift,” if we will) to weaken
voiceless stops (fully consolidated in pre-consonantal position, but only half-way so in pre-vocalic position).
As for the “preservation” of *k in Karajá, that is only half the story, as we have seen in Chapter 3.

Clear correspondences in Jê for Karajá /h/ have not yet been found. /h/ could have derived historically from a
stop (for instance, */); that would provide an explanation for its behavior, in terms of consonantal replacement,
with the stem hO ‘to wash’.
283process of spirantization after the alternation between *k and *r was already in place (e.g.
*kE ‘to scratch’ ~ nominal form *rE > hE ~ rE). In fact, there are no cases of r-infixation
involving the velar stop before a front vowel; thus, it is reasonable to suggest that, in the
small corpus of consonant-replacing verbs, /k/ and /h/ are in complementary distribution
(again, with the exception of hO ‘to wash’). Likely cognates in Jê suggest that this
interpretation is on the right path (cf. Meb -ke ~ -ke≠ ‘to scratch’ :: Karajá hE; Meb. kOkje ~kOkjer ‘to cut with a cutting instrument’ :: Karajá kOhE).

"8. Final remarksKarajá presents a pervasive and straightforward mechanism to create subordinate clauses,
shared by relative, complement, and ‘adverbial’ clauses alike. This device is clause
nominalization: an entire clause is nominalized and, as such, can occur in all the positions
traditionally occupied by noun phrases (including subject and direct objects, objects of
postpositions, and noun modifiers). Clause nominalization (a syntactic process) differs from
lexical nominalization (a morphological process) in a number of ways, the main one being
that the former preserves all the inflectional properties of the verb. With subordinate clauses
occuring in the position of a bare nominal (that is, a noun phrase not followed by
28Notice that in both nominalizing suffixes, -dV and -TV, ‘V’ is a copy of the last vowel in the verb stem.
260postpositions or an article), the subordinate status of the clause is indicated by stress shift, an
interesting case of non-concatenative morphology which went unnoticed in previous
descriptions of Karajá grammar.","[271, 272]"

but there is a clear-cut distinction between subject pronouns and non-subject pronouns.
Pronominal subjects are expressed by the independent pronouns ♀ dIkar´) (♂ dIar´)) ‘I’, kai
‘you’, and Î´kI (♂ ÎII) ‘he/she/it’, all of which can be pluralized by the morpheme -boho
(dIkar´)-boho ‘we (exclusive)’, kai-boho ‘you (plural)’, and Î´kI-boho ‘they’). Non-subject
pronominal NPs (such as direct objects, objects of postpositions, and possessors) are
expressed by a series of pronominal affixes (Table 11). The noun id´) ‘human, people’
followed by the pluralizer -boho works as a first person plural inclusive pronoun. A major

are suppletive forms for both the second- (bU ‘your father’) and third-persons (Î´bÈ ‘his father’).
38difference between nouns such as id´) and real pronouns is in the fact that independent
pronouns such as dIkar´) cannot occur with postpositions or as possessors.
As the examples above suggest, Karajá is predominantly agglutinative, fusion
between morphemes being fairly rare. However, under certain circumstances, person and
voice/valence markers can be merged phonologically, making the morphological
segmentation less obvious. Thus, in the examples below, the second person prefix Îa- fuses
with the transitive marker I- (30b) and with the intransitive marker a- (31):(30)a.ÎadiwÈ5Îeb.Îa-d-I-wÈèÎ-e(31)♂ÎewÈ5Îe

In all the examples above, the domain noun occupies the position of core arguments
of the verb (subject or direct object), which are not morphologically marked in Karajá.
However, when the domain noun is an oblique NP, the postposition that marks such NPs will
occur after the restrictive clause, cliticized to the verb (a further argument for the nominal
status of the relative clause). Thus, while with core arguments stress shift may be the only
surface indicator of subordination, in examples such as (28) the postposition can also be seen
as an indicator of the subordinate nature of the clause. Notice that stress shift also occurs in
10kUa ‘that (distant from both the speaker and the addressee)’ is a demonstrative (not a relative pronoun, as the
translation of the example may suggest). There are two other demonstratives in Karajá, ka ‘this’ and kia ‘that
(close to the addressee)’ (see example 40).
232those cases in which the subordinate verb is followed by an article or a postposition. In such
cases, however, stress shift may be analyzed as being triggered by the article or the
postposition (see 3.3 below). Therefore, stress shift will only be indicated in this paper in
cases in which it is the only surface marker of subordination.
In (28) below, the relative clause modifies the object of the verb ♀ rakuSi ‘to eat’ (♂roSi), which is marked by the postposition èb´), as we have seen above (21). The postposition
marking the object will occur after the relative clause. This is further illustrated by examples

"125Vowel harmony is among the most remarkable characteristics of Karajá phonology.
Common in African languages, [ATR] vowel harmony is exceedingly rare outside of Africa;
Karajá presents the first documented case of this type of vowel harmony in South America.
Since most languages presenting [ATR] vowel harmony are genetically or areally related, the
Karajá case provides a different perspective for the typological understanding of the
phenomenon (Ribeiro 2002). Once again, the chapter does not provide the final word on the
subject, indicating instead additional topics for investigation; for instance, a thorough
accoustic analysis of the vowel inventory is yet to be conducted, in order to investigate
whether the mechanisms underlying [ATR] distinctions in Karajá are similar to those found
in better-known languages.","[136, 137]"

(lit. ‘The hawk will eat your eyes.’)6.1.3 Vowel harmony and grammatical functionAs metaphony in Portuguese (which serves to distinguish nouns from verbs, and
secondarily reinforces gender and number distinctions), vowel harmony in Karajá (or its lack
thereof) may play a role in grammatical distinctions. Although a finite verb in Karajá
generally ends with an aspectual-modal clitic, such a clitic may be suppressed in casual
speech. As we have seen, two of the aspectual-modal clitics, èkre ‘future’ and èr-e
‘imperfective’, can trigger vowel harmony. The latter, by far the most frequent aspectualmodal clitic, can be suppressed while still triggering vowel harmony (80)—a case of
assimilation in absentia, as I mentioned elsewhere (Ribeiro 2005:103). Vowel harmony may
be, in such cases, the sole mark of aspect. On the other hand, the lack of vowel harmony is,
to a certain extent, a mark of aspect as well, in examples such as (81) and (82) below; the fact
that such examples do not display vowel harmony is in itself an indication, by exclusion, that
such verbs are not imperfective (marked by the harmony-triggering clitic èr-e) or future
(marked by èkre).","[125, 126]"
"2.1Subject agreement173Person agreement displays a strictly nominative pattern, with the verb always
agreeing with the subject, be it intransitive (2a) or transitive (2b). Person agreement markers
are distributed into two different sets, one occurring in the realis (present and past tenses) and
the other in the irrealis (future, potential, and admonitory). These prefixes are listed in Table

English or Portuguese, on the other, is that in Karajá there are no lexical opposites for
direction, such as English come versus go and bring versus take. In Karajá, such a
distinction is completely dependent on the morphological mechanisms that are made
available by the language. Thus, in the examples below, the prefix r- indicates that the event
is seen as occurring away from the current location of the speaker (centrifugal direction),
32The same set of prefixes is used for singular and plural. There is also a distinction between a first person
plural exclusive (marked by the same set of prefixes used for first person singular) and a first person plural
inclusive (inflected for third person). The prefix k´- ‘3rd person’ is restricted to the centripetal direction of the
irrealis mood.

‘You better stay, for I’m going far.’Maia (2002:155) analyzes ♂ èdori as a ‘focus marker,’ which is probably a mistake:
being a second-position clitic, it is not surprising that this morpheme occurs after fronted
elements, but that is also the case of most discourse-oriented particles in the language (see
Chapter 4). Fortune (1970) translates it (rightly, I think) as ‘because.’ As a second-position
clitic, èdokuri attaches to the first constituent of the clause, regardless of its syntactic status.
In (79) above, èdokuri attaches to a postpositional phrase. The examples below illustrate its
occurrence with noun phrases (81) and a predicate (82):(81)♂b´-d-a-lOèkE,biuèdori255k´-d-∅-Oaèk´re2-CTPT-INTR-enter=POT

‘I won’t go, because it is dangerous.’
In fact, its distribution and phonological behavior suggest that èdokuri belongs in the
large class of speech-act particles, that inform on the attitude of the speaker with relation to
the utterance (indicating certainty, doubt, excitement, boredom, sympathy, surprise,
assertiveness, resolve, etc.). As other speech act clitics, èdokuri is unstressed; notice that,
unlike adpositions, èdokuri does not change the stress of the verb phrase to which it attaches;
thus, i-Oha)ruèr-eèdori ‘because it is dangerous’ is pronounced [iOha)""ruredori].
Analyzing èdokuri as a speech act clitic helps us to understand the differences
between dokuri-clauses and the reason clauses described above: dokuri-clauses are probably
examples of speech act adverbial clauses, whose function, as defined by Thompson &
Longacre (1985:203) “is not to modify or qualify the main clause in any way, but to modify
or qualify, as it were, the speech act which the speaker is performing in uttering the main
clause.” In fact, most attitude markers can be seen as speech-act subordinators to a certain
extent, since they anchor the utterance to a previous one; in an example such as (83) below,
the attitude markers èTOE ‘enthusiasm’ and èT´) ‘repetition’ can only be interpreted in
reference to a previous speech act (it was jokingly said as a warning to a child who insisted in
climbing a tree against a parent’s repeated admoestation):(83)b´-d-∅-UrUèkreèTOEèT´)

finds nominalized forms of the verbs playing the role of complements. Deverbal nouns may
be preceded by a grammatical possessor which corresponds to the original absolutive
argument of the verb—that is, to the subject of an intransitive verb, such as in wa-rira ‘my
walking’ (from ♀ rika ~ ritSa ‘to walk’), or to the object of a transitive verb, such as inkOÎUd¸) b´)d´) ‘turtle catching.’ (from b´) ‘to catch’). These constructions occur in any of the

In addition, the suffix -dU forms subject nouns (that is, nouns refering to the subject of the

"5. Adverbial clausesKarajá apparently has few, if any, true adverbial clauses, a fact that mirrors the
overall lack of adverbs in the language.19 Corresponding to locative adverbs (‘here’, ‘there’,
‘hither’, ‘thither’) and temporal adverbs (‘yesterday’, ‘tomorrow’), Karajá has demonstrative
pronouns (ka ‘proximal’, k´da) ‘distal’) followed by postpositions (kaèkI ‘here’; ♀ kaèku, ♂kaèu ‘yesterday’; ♀ k´da)èku, ♂ k´da)èu ‘the day before yesterday; the day after tomorrow’).
Corresponding to manner adverbs (‘quickly’, ‘swiftly,’ etc.), Karajá has nouns followed by
the postposition èb´) (wÈèb´) ‘quickly,’ etc.). Thus, just as most adverbial functions are
played by postpositional phrases, functions traditionally associated with adverbial clauses are
played by ‘postpositional clauses’ in Karajá. Below are examples of allative, locative, and
temporal clauses:(51)♀i-r´bI a-hEèb´)

19One candidate for adverbhood would be widZi ‘today, now’. The locative morphemes ÎU, Îab´), and Îai
(which, as we have seen, are suppletive third-person forms of postpositions) could also be alternatively
analyzed as adverbs. Even if these morphemes are considered as adverbs, this would be a closed class in

Notice that the adverbial-like subordinate clauses above are structurally identical to
relative clauses which modify oblique domain nouns (as seen in Section 3 above), except for
the lack of a domain noun. That is, the locative clauses above can be analyzed as headless
relative clauses. This structural identity between relative clauses and adverbial clauses is not
unusual. As Thompson & Longacre (1985:179) point out, adverbial clauses expressing time,
location, and manner can commonly be paraphrased, in many languages, “with a relative
clause with a generic and relatively semantically empty head noun: time, place, and
way/manner, respectivelly;” such clauses have also in common the fact that they can be
replaced by a single word, an adverb, such as today (time), here (location), and quickly
(manner) in English and other languages with a clear class of adverbs.","[253, 254]"

‘become dry’Since the velar stop is generally suppressed in male speech, the formal identity

although the verb roots ♀ aka ‘to run’ and ♀ ka ‘to dig’ may become homophonous in male138speech (♂ a), their deverbal nouns will still differ: ara ‘the action of running’ versus ra ‘the
action of digging’. Therefore, a regular derivational rule can only be identified if the female
speech is taken into consideration.93.2. d-droppingThis process consists in the deletion in the male speech of an alveolar nasal consonant
occurring in the corresponding female speech form. It seems to involve only two morphemes9A misunderstanding of the male-female speech distinctions may also lead to erroneous ethnographic
statements. Thus, Donahue (1982), appraising the antiquity of Karajá agriculture, suggests that the Karajá word
for ‘corn’ entered the Karajá lexicon through a European language, and that, therefore, the cultivation of this
product was a recent introduction into Karajá culture:
The Karajá word for corn is mai, which happens also to be the French word for corn, both
surely derived from maize, a word of Carib [sic] origin. It could well be that corn was
introduced to the Karajá by Europeans after contact, an interesting case of circuitous
diffusion. If such an American staple of corn were introduced by Europeans, it might indicate
that the Karajá have come to horticulture quite a bit later than many other central Brazilian
tribes. [Donahue 1982: 83]Donahue would probably have reached a different conclusion if the female speech form, ba)ki [ma""ki] (which, as
Ehrenreich suggests, represents “an older form of the idiom”), were taken into consideration. Another example
is the analysis of Javaé sexuality suggested by anthropologist Patrícia Rodrigues (1993), based on the mistaken
assumption that the words for ‘vagina’ and ‘skin’ were homophonous:
“[…] the fact that tyky means both ‘skin’, ‘clothes’, and one of the words for ‘body’, and also
‘vagina’, could mean that, contrary to western conception, which restrict sexuality to the
genital organs, the Javaé would understand the whole female body as an extension of the
vagina, an eroticized whole. The skin that covers the entire body would be as eroticized and
permeated with sexuality as the genital organ, a notion that transforms the woman (as
wife/sexual partner) into a sexual being […], as a whole, and not only as a possessor of sexual
anatomic parts.” [Rodrigues 1993: 312]
Interesting as it may sound, this hypothesis does not find any support in the linguistic data. In fact, the words
for ‘skin’ and ‘vagina’ may become homophonous in the male speech, but only when pronounced in isolation.
Since there is a constraint against surface monosylabic words, the word for ‘vagina’, ÎÈ, will be pronounced as
ÎÈÈ when occurring by itself, and, given the phonological processes described above, the word for ‘skin,
clothes’, Î´kÈ (ÎÈkÈ, in Javaé and Xambioá) may be optionally pronounced as ♂ ÎÈÈ. Homophony between these
two words is limited to these cases. They never become homophonous in the female speech. Even in male
speech, they will never become homophonous when combined with other morphemes: i-ÎÈ ‘her vagina’, i-ÎÈÈ
‘her/his/its skin, clothes’.

pro-form ♀ ado) [a""no)] ‘something’ (♂ ao)). The indefinite article attaches to entire noun
phrases (13). The pro-form ♀ ado) generally occurs in combination with emphatic,
interrogative, and discourse particles (14). It also occurs in combination with the
nominalizer suffix -da) (15)10.","[149, 150, 151]"

descriptives derived from verbs, such as in (66)-(68) above, are also nouns. Although this is
not obvious in the examples above, since the primitive verbs and their noun forms happen to
be homonymous, it becomes clear with verbs that are formally differentiated from their
derived nouns. Such is the case with verbs such as Oka ‘to make holes’, kÈka ‘to tear’, andUk´) ‘to dry’, whose corresponding noun forms are derived by consonantal replacement (as
we have seen, a common mechanism to derive nouns from verbs):(70)(71)a.wa-bE-d-EkO

adjectives. Notwithstanding this, I consider them to be verbal nouns, which is a corollary of
the lack of distinction between nouns and adjectives in Karajá. As Haspelmath (1994, 152)
states, “it is quite clear that not all languages have participles. The definition of participle
(‘verb-derived adjective within a verbal paradigm’) apparently presupposes the existence of
adjectives in a language. Since there are many languages that lack primary adjectives, at
least these languages will also lack participles.”","[228, 229]"

Therefore, this process occurs only with a closed set of words, all of them containing

such as the indefinite article èdo), which are intrinsically unstressed.
140in the male speech, becoming ♂ ao)da) [ao)""na], probably due to analogy with its native
homonym, ado)da) ‘thing’.113.3. Lexical differencesIn some cases, the forms occurring in the male and female speech may be totally
different words. That is the case of the vocative interjections (♀ wu, ♂ kÈ) and of the
interjections expressing surprise or admiration (♀ bi, ♂ bEbE). Examples such as these-involving interjections and other “emotive words”--are rather common in other languages.
Fortune and Fortune (1975: 115-6) also mention two other cases in which “the men’s speech
form is totally different from the women’s”—the verbs ‘to cry’ and (in my translation) ‘to
become angry’. This is clearly a mistake. The roots obu and hi ‘to cry’ and TIra and EbUrE
‘to become angry’ are used in both female and male speech to refer to processes happening to
female and male subjects, respectively—a difference having no relation with the female
versus male speech distinctions with which this chapter is concerned.12 Similar examples are
found in Yana, according to Sapir’s (1949) description:11In Javaé, as we will see, only the male forms of the words containing the morphemes ado) and do) were
preserved: ao)da ‘thing’, hirarièo) ‘a girl’ etc. However, the loanword for ‘pineapple’ in Javaé maintains the
original [n] in both male and female speech: ado)da). This example suggests that the drift towards male speech
(if there was indeed one; see Section 6) was already consolidated by the time this loanword entered the
language (cf. section 4).
12
Similar mistakes were made by Ehrenreich (1894), in a time when knowledge of Portuguese among the
Karajá was probably very rare, making communication between outsiders and the Karajá a challenging
endeavor. He listed as male-female speech variants words that actually have different meanings, and are
common to both varieties. That is the case of the words watSiwi ‘cooking pot’ and b´TE ‘plate’, listed by
Ehrenreich as the male- and female-speech forms for ‘pot’, respectively (Ehrenreich 1894:23).
141(…) there is a small number of verb stems which apply exclusively to activity
carried on by a male or by a female; e.g., ni-, ni@- “a male goes” but ‘a- “a
female goes,” bu-ri-, bu-ri@- “a man dances” but dja-ri, dja-ri@-, “a woman
dances.” In the latter case the difference of verb probably reflects an actual
difference in the style of dancing. [1949:206]
Following Sapir, I shall suggest that, for ‘to cry’ and ‘to get angry’, the differences between
the verbs in Karajá would probably also reflect actual differences in the processes of crying
and getting angry. Notice that the verb obu ‘(a woman) to cry’ is also used to refer to the
sounds made by birds and to the ritual wailing of deceased relatives, performed exclusively
by women.
Fortune & Fortune (1963, 16) also include in the same category of ‘totally different’
words the verb ♀ ohokudZa ‘to listen’ (♂ ohola). However, in spite of the somewhat striking
surface differences between the form used in female speech and the one used in male speech,
the latter can be regularly derived from the former by the processes described above: kdropping and vowel deletion. The differences between the consonants occurring in the last
syllable of both forms, dZ versus l, can also be explained as the result of a regular
phonological process. As seen in Chapter 2, the lateral \l\ becomes palatalized when
contiguous to the [high, +ATR] vowels /i/, /È5/, and /u/. In the aforementioned example,
palatalization does not occur in the male form because the vowel /u/, which would trigger it,
is not present. A similar example is ♀ b´dokudZ´kE ‘pirarucu fish’, ♂ b´dOl´kE ~ b´dOlEE.","[151, 152, 153]"

In narrative texts, especially those narrated mostly in 3rd person, directional inflection
is frequently used to signal which character the speaker chooses to be more relevant for the
story, by assigning to him or her the role of deictic center. This function of the directional
markers in Karajá is similar to the role played by obviation systems, such as the one
occurring in Algonquian languages. In these languages, according to Dahlstrom (1999:36),
“if more than one third person is mentioned within a certain syntactic domain, then the third
person most central to the discourse is referred to by proximate forms (of nouns, pronouns, or
verb agreement) and the more peripheral third persons are referred to by obviative forms.”
The factors involved on assigning proximate or obviative status are mostly semantic or
discursive. Thus, “if one of the two third persons is a human and the other is (notionally)
inanimate, the human will always be proximate and the inanimate third person will always be
obviative.” When both third persons are humans, “the third person chosen as proximate is
often the one the speaker feels closest to, such as a relative of the speaker as opposed to a
nonrelative, a Mesquakie as opposed to an Indian of another tribe, or an Indian as opposed to182a non-Indian.” However, Dahlstrom remarks that these are tendencies, “not hard and fast
rules” (Dahlstrom op. cit., 44-45).
In Karajá, quite interesting is the fact that, in choosing the character to whom to
assign higher discourse prominence, objective factors such as physical closeness to the
speaker can be overcome by factors such as the place where crucial actions are taking place.
Thus, in the short text presented here, ‘The Hawk and the Snake’ (16), the hawk is initially
chosen as the deictic center, as shown by the opposition between the verb forms robière
‘he/she saw (thither),’ in Line D, and dobiède ‘he/she saw (hither),’ in Line E. Notice that at
this point the hawk is flying in the sky. The choice of ‘sky’ as opposed to ‘ground’ is not
exactly what one would expect if a purely anthropocentric perspective were adopted.","[193, 194]"

‘As soon as he gets there, they will come for us.’22Haspelmath (1995:3) defines converb as “a nonfinite verb form whose main function
is to mark adverbial subordination” [his emphasis] “Another way of putting it”, he adds, “is
that converbs are verbal adverbs, just like participles are verbal adjectives.”23 At first, from a22This is one of the few examples of a third-person centripetal verb in the realis that does not occur with the
prefix k´-. Possible semantic motivations for the absence of the prefix are being investigated.
23
Similar constructions have been called ‘absolutive clauses’ by some authors. According to Thompson &
Longacre (1985:200-203), absolutive “is a cover term for a subordinate clause type in which the following
conditions hold: (i) the clause is marked in some way as being subordinate; (ii) there is no explicit signal of the
248grammatical point of view, there seems to be no reason to distinguish converbs from the
other postpositional phrases described in the preceding sections. However, there is a crucial
difference between them: while the clauses discussed earlier are commonly marked for tense,
converbs generally are not. Since typical finite clauses in Karajá are characterized by the
presence of a tense-aspect marker, a distinguishing feature of converbs (as opposed to the
other postpositional clauses) is their nonfiniteness (which, according to Haspelmath, is a
definitional characteristic of converbs).
In the majority of the examples, the converb has the same subject as the main clause,
but that is not necessarily the case. As examples (72) and (73) show, converbs with different
subjects are also possible.","[258, 259, 260]"

markers are distributed into two different sets, one occurring in the realis (present and past
tenses) and the other in the irrealis (future, potential, and admonitory). These prefixes are
listed in Table 12 below.1515The same set of prefixes is used for singular and plural. There is also a distinction between a first person
plural exclusive (marked by the same set of prefixes used for first person singular) and a first person plural
inclusive (inflected for third person). The prefix k´- ‘3rd person’ is restricted to the centripetal direction of the
irrealis mood.

analogical mistakes are common, due to the over-application of phonological correspondence
rules. 17 Similar mistakes may happen in Karajá when a female speaker is quoting a male
speaker, or vice-versa. Although most evidence I have for such hypercorrection is anecdotal,
18I managed to find at least one example on print. In a first, experimental edition of thegospel according to St. John, in the famous passage in which Jesus talks to the Samaritan
woman by the well (John 4:7-9), a [tS] was inserted in the word Samaria in the quotation of17For instance, a Portuguese speaker may erroneously assume that the Spanish form corresponding to
Portuguese corte ‘a cut’ is *cuerte, by analogy with several cognate pairs displaying regular phonological
correspondences (Port. sorte :: Sp. suerte; Port. morte :: Sp. muerte; Port. forte :: Sp. fuerte; etc.).
18
Although both varieties are mutually intelligible, one must be careful in trying to elicit data from the female
speech with a male consultant, or vice-versa. As speakers of different dialects tend to do, traits considered as
being ‘typical’ of the other dialect may be exaggerated. While working on a project of lexical compilation, a
number of Karajá male teachers were discussing the differences between homophony and polysemy. A pair of
homophonous words was then chosen as example: riu ‘to hunt’ and riu ‘he/she defecated’. When asked
whether these words would also be identical in the female speech, they promptly said that both would occur
with the velar stop, only to be immediately corrected by the only Karajá female in the room. As it turns out, riu
‘to hunt’ and riku ‘he/she defecated’ are not homophonous in the female speech.

3.8 Social correlates: idZoi vs. iS
iS´´)As Fortune & Fortune (1975) point out, male vs. female speech distinctions are part
of a wider set of social rules concerning gender differentiations, very important in Karajá
society. Although both males and females traditionally received, upon puberty, the circular
facial tattoos characteristic of the tribe, body painting patterns and ornaments are clearly
distinct with relation to gender. Besides common roles traditionally associated with each
gender (women as ceramists, men as wood carvers; women as manufacturers of delicately
woven baskets, men as manufacturers of rough and sturdy carrying baskets; etc.), social
space is clearly delineated geographically as well: the village, seen as the woman’s place par
excellence in a matrilocal society, is called iS´) ha)wa ‘the place of iS´)’, a noun which19The translation work seems to be done in cooperation between native consultants and the
missionaries. As far as I know, all the native consultants were males. Considering that the
Fortunes’ analysis of the use of forms such as ♀ ritSa vs. ♂ ria is essentially correct (female
speech is considered as more conservative, and [tS] is shown to be the result of the
palatalization of /k/; cf. Fortune & Fortune 1977), a hypercorrection mistake such as this
could only have been made by a native speaker. The mistake was duly corrected in the
current edition of the New Testament (1983).
151designates a category including women and children of both genders--as opposed to ♀ itSoi
(♂ idZoi), generally translated in Portuguese as a rapaziada ‘the guys’, which refers to the
totality of initiated men.20
The exclusively-male ritual spaces, where the main festivals are planned and
performed, are called idZoi-da ‘the place of the guys’. The idZoi-da--which includes not only
the ritual plaza (kube) and the house where ritual masks are made and stored (hetokrE), but
also the paths leading to them—is strictly forbidden to women (Toral 1992). Although the
women also have their own ritual space, the hirari-da (hirari ‘young girl’), such space is not
exclusively for them, as men are free to wander around. While the male ritual space is
actively defined as the one where rituals take place and women are forbidden, the female
ritual space is passively defined: it is the place where they witness, mostly as mere
expectators, the rituals taking place. As Toral (1992:68) points out, “strictly speaking, the
only space that truly belongs to the women is the interior of the houses.” The parallels
between such social restrictions and language use are transparent: while male speech is
characterized by a higher degree of variation and flexibility (since many k-preserving forms
can be optionally used by men), female speech is characterized by a higher degree of rigidity,
reflecting women’s general lack of social mobility in Karajá society.
Satirical songs--including the wErU wiu ‘maraca songs’ (Conrad 1997; cf. Chapter 5),
generally used to mock atypical social behaviors--often criticize an individual whose
transgressions blur the traditional gender lines within Karajá society, frowning upon, for
instance, a man who serves his own food (therefore invading a typically female social space):20For the ongoing grammaticalization of idZoi into a 1st person pronoun, see Chapter 4.

"237A similar state of affairs may very well have been the diachronic source of the
‘subordinating accent’ in Karajá. The shift could have been originally triggered by a
subordinating morpheme of some sort,12 which would have later disappeared, leaving stress
shift as evidence of its diachronic existence.
Another possible origin would be a more general, delimiting use of stress (common in
languages where stress is predictable), to mark the boundaries of the noun phrase. However,
given the lack of comparative evidence, one can only speculate on the origins of such
phenomenon.133.4 Previous descriptionsIn spite of its extreme pervasiveness, the phenomenon of the ‘subordinating accent’
was not mentioned in previous accounts of Karajá grammar (Fortune & Fortune 1964,
Fortune 1970, Fortune 1973, Maia 1998). In his typological study, Maia states that he was
able to find “hypothetical relative constructions” only through direct elicitation, “similar
structures not being detected in the texts analyzed” (Maia 1998:33).14 The “hypothetical”
here relates to the fact that he could not identify any relative pronoun (or any subordinating
morpheme, for that matter) in the constructions considered. Notwithstanding this, the
examples of “hypothetical relative constructions” that he provides (reproduced below with
12This ‘subordinating’ morpheme could have been a nominal clitic, such as an article (which would thus pair
with the indefinite article ♀ èdo)).
13
Sinchronically, one could postulate the existence of a ‘zero clitic’ to account for the stress shift. Since this
more abstract analysis does not necessarily present any analytical advantage, I will adopt a more concrete
analysis in this paper, indicating the stress shift whenever necessary.
14
Although Maia’s statement seems to suggest that relative clauses are less common in texts than in elicited
materials, that is certainly not the case. Most examples in this paper were indeed taken from texts, where
subordination is extremely common. In fact, all the subordinate clause types here described are highly favored
constructions in Karajá grammar.
238my own transcription and morphological segmentation) very likely presented the stress shift
illustrated above. Since Maia relies on the rather inaccurate orthography used in Karajá
schools, the stress shift went unnoticed in his analysis.15Maia’s examples of “hypothetical relative constructions” reanalized

Although stress shift as a subordinating device is not mentioned in the work of the
SIL missionaries, it is indicated in their translation of the New Testament by the use of an
accent on the aspectual clitic (as mentioned in Chapter 1). This procedure, however, is not
adopted in the common orthography taught at the Karajá schools.","[248, 249, 250]"
"265Besides the scarcity of data on some of its now-extinct members, such as the
languages belonging to the Purí and Kamakã families, Macro-Jê comparative studies run into
problems that typically plague long-range comparativists: roots are generally isolating and
monosyllabic, and syllabic patterns are rather simple. Since most likely cognates tend to be
of the CV type, there is a greater risk of accidental similarities. That risk is particularly
increased by an apparent neglect to abide by the comparative method when proposing
cognates. A case in point is the work of Aryon Rodrigues, a major Brazilian scholar, on
comparative Macro-Jê linguistics. Besides adding little to the cognate sets already identified
by previous authors (Guérios, Loukotka), Rodrigues’ cognate inventories (Rodrigues 1999,
Rodrigues & Cabral 2007) illustrate primary methodological mistakes, including an obvious
case of borrowing (the word for ‘maize’, which is likely of Arawák origin; cf. Ribeiro 2010)
and assigning cognate words to wrong cognate sets--for instance, Kaingáng krE) ‘egg’ is
considered a cognate of the word for ‘egg’ in other Jê languages, which trace back to ProtoJê *NrE, even though (as Davis had already demonstrated) Kaingáng preserved Proto-Jê *N as
/N/; Kaingáng krE) traces back to Proto-Jê kra ‘offspring’ instead. As examples such as this
illustrate, little attention is given to phonological regularity, even in the case of a fairly wellestablished family as Jê. Rodrigues’ main contribution to comparative Macro-Jê studies was
the detection of shared morphological similarities which are likely due to common
inheritance (Rodrigues 1992, 2000b; Ribeiro 2011). Particularly relevant for Karajá are the
so-called “relational prefixes”, linking morphemes discussed in Section 3.2 below (cf.
Chapter 4 as well).
While Macro-Jê comparative linguistics has been marked by an overall lack of
methodological soundness, resulting in questionable proposals of genetic relationship (as266illustrated by the inclusion of Guató), it has attracted, on the other hand, unfounded
pessimism. A case in point is Dixon & Aikhenvald’s (1999:18) claim that the similarities
among the several families within Macro-Jê would be due to areal, rather than genetic,
factors:“Rather than all the Macro-Je families being related in a higher-level tree, it seems to
us that they could constitute a long-term linguistic area; this would account for their
considerable typological similarities. (There may, of course, be genetic links between
some of the established families, within the linguistic area.)”
Such suggestion reveals a lack of familiarity with the evidence put forth by authors such as
Guérios, Loukotka, Davis, Gudschinsky, Boswood, and Rodrigues—mostly items of basic
vocabulary, such as body-part terms, and grammatical morphemes. Although not as robust
as one would wish (due in part to the temporal depth involved), such evidence points to
genetic, rather than areal, relationship.29 Furthermore, the typological similarities alluded to
by Dixon & Aikhenvald are common in lowland South America, and thus do not set MacroJê languages apart as a group.
Macro-Jê is, to a certain extent, reminiscent of North America’s Algic, in the sense
that, in both cases, there is a close-knit, well-established family (Algoquian; Jê, in our case)
and a number of distantly-related families or isolates (Wiyot and Yurok; Karajá, Ofayé, and
several others, in our case). A major difference is that there is even more internal diversity in
Macro-Jê, suggesting that it is even older than Algic. If, as Goddard (1991:64) states,
“Algonquian, Wiyot, and Yurok form a genetic grouping that is at, or very close to, the
maximum depth at which it is possible to reconstruct features of the protolanguage that retain
any appreciable degree of resolution,” Macro-Jê may provide an even fuzzier picture. For
29Similar objections against Dixon & Aikhenvald’s claims are raised by Voort (2004:213).
267most of the stock, however, regular phonological and grammatical correspondences are still
being uncovered, but one has to keep in mind the limitations mentioned by Goddard (op. cit.)
for Algic:
“[…] it is methodologically instructive to note that this is a case in which the
comparative method produces a proof of genetic relationship without there being a
reconstructed phonology or phonological history beyond what is implied by a handful
of equations of identity, or near identity.”","[276, 277, 278, 279]"

"221CHAPTER 5
Subordinate Clauses1. IntroductionThis chapter describes subordinate clauses in Karajá, including relative clauses, complement
clauses, and (the functional equivalents of) adverbial clauses. Although this study is mainly
concerned with subordinate clauses proper (that is, complements or modifiers which present
the internal structure of a full clause), it will also briefly discuss nominalized complements,
very common functional equivalents of subordinate clauses in Karajá.
The basic mechanism to signal subordination, as illustrated by relative and
complement clauses in subject and direct object positions, is stress shift, an interesting
example of non-concatenative morphology. As we have seen, a typical finite verb in Karajá
presents tense-aspect clitics, which are unstressed. In independent clauses, the stress falls
ordinarily on the last syllable of the verb stem (1). In relative clauses, however, the stress
shifts to the tense-aspect clitic (2). The entire subordinate clause behaves as a noun phrase,
and, as such, may take nominal clitics such as the indefinite article (3) ♀ èdo) (♂ èo)) (and, as
we will see, postpositions):(1)Îori ∅-d-∅-OrOèd-e

‘a White man who came ashore’Considering the role they play in signaling adverbial subordination, postpositions will
also be described in this chapter (Section 2). Section 3 will be dedicated to the description of
the properties of relative clauses, providing a background for the discussion of complement
clauses (Section 4) and postpostional clauses (Section 5), which in Karajá play most of the
functions traditionally associated with adverbial clauses. Section 6 describes nominalized
complements. Section 7 deals with èdokuri clauses, a case of speech act adverbial
subordination. Section 8 provides a summary of the chapter.","[232, 233, 234]"
"8.3 MorphosyntaxKarajá is an SOV, head-marking language. Core NP arguments—that is, subject and
direct object—are not morphologically marked. Pronominal subjects are expressed by a
series of free pronouns, such as ♀ dIkar´) ‘I’ in (28) below, while pronominal objects are37expressed by a series of bound morphemes, such as wa- ‘1st person’ in (29). In contrast to a
fairly simple nominal morphology, Karajá presents a complex verb morphology, being
traditionally described as having a very irregular fused set of prefixes indicating person,
aspect, object, and direction (Fortune & Fortune 1964, Wiesemann 1986, Maia 1998).
However, a more careful analysis reveals a rather regular, mostly agglutinating morphology,
with separate prefixes indicating person (and cumulatively, mood), direction, and valence
(28). In addition, pronominal direct objects are obligatorily incorporated into the verb (29).","[48, 49]"

The domain of vowel harmony seems to be the phonological word, characterized by a
single primary stress. Although stress seems to be useful in determining the domain of vowel
harmony, it is irrelevant in characterizing triggers, since, as we have seen, vowel harmony113can be triggered not only by stems and derivational suffixes (which are intrinsically tonic),
but by clitics (which are intrinsically unstressed) as well.
Since Karajá is an SOV language and the object tends to form a prosodic unit with the
verb, vowel harmony can take place between the verb and the object. Considerations of
frequency seems to play a role in predicting whether vowel harmony will take place. That
seems to be especially common with idiomatic and formulaic constructions (such as curses).
A case in point is the noun b´dE ‘time, ground, world’, which occurs in a number of
idiomatic expressions as an ‘empty’ object (b´dE + rÈrÈ ‘remember’ > ‘to become sad’; b´dE
+ buka ‘disagree; not fit’ > ‘to be unlucky, when fishing, hunting, etc.’; b´dE + kErÈ ‘to
know’ > ‘to realize’). This word also occurs in non-idiomatic constructions, as the subject of
‘atmospheric’ verbs (‘to cool down’, ‘to become silent’, ‘to become dark’, etc.) or as an
object. In its more idiomatic uses, b´dE can cliticize to the verb or even be incorporated into
it; as the examples below demonstrate, vowel harmony triggered by the first vowel in the
verb root buka extends all the way to the object b´dE (78). Vowel harmony between the verb
and its object is further illustrated by (79), a curse, where the clitic èr-e ‘imperfective’
triggers vowel harmony throughout the verb, reaching the object ruE ‘eye’.","[124, 125]"
"213This section examines the hypothesis that lexemes denoting adjectival meanings in
Karajá (henceforth ‘descriptives’) are, in fact, nouns (generally, abstract nouns), be they in
predicative or attributive use. That is, words corresponding to adjectives in languages such
as English or Portuguese, such as ‘angry,’ ‘red,’ ‘short,’ would be better translated as abstract
nouns—‘anger,’ ‘redness,’ and ‘shortness,’ respectively.

Karajá has only one voiceless stop, /k/, which corresponds regularly to *k in Proto-Jê. The
lack of /p/ and /t/ in Karajá was likely the result of a systematic process of lenition (cf. ProtoJê *par ‘foot’ :: Karajá wa; Proto-Jê *tÈk ‘to die’ :: Karajá r´bU). Furthermore, consonantal
clusters involving a voiceless stop were systematically simplified by the complete
elimination of the stop:271(6)cluster simplification in Karajá

explain the genesis of male vs. female speech differentiations (Chapter 3) and may also play
an important role in explaining the origins of the derivational process of consonantal
replacement described in Chapter 4 (cf. Section 3.4 below).
Advances in both descriptive and comparative Macro-Jê linguistics are contributing
to improve not only the quantity of cognates, but—more importantly—their quality.
Consider, for instance, the words for ‘nose’ in both Karajá and Proto-Jê, which Davis had
already identified as likely cognates. Fossilized phonological material which was initially
unaccounted for can now find an explanation, thanks to a better knowledge of the Karajá
lexicon: the final syllable in the Karajá word is synchronically unanalyzable, but a related
word, d-EaÎI ‘nasal bridge’ (cf. ÎI ‘bone’), clearly suggests that the last syllable in d-EaT´)
was once a separate morpheme.30
In addition to corroborating Davis’ correspondences, additional research is
contributing to refine them. For instance, the final syllable in the word for ‘ash’ in Karajá30The word reconstructed by Davis for ‘nose’ was *≠i≠akrE, identical with the Apinajé word. The final
sylllable, present in most Northern Jê languages, is probably a reflex of Proto-Jê *krE ‘hole’; therefore, Apinajé
≠i≠akrE (and related forms in other Northern Jê languages) probably meant ‘nostrils’ originally. My
reconstruction takes into consideration the Southern Jê word (Kaingáng n¸)je)), which does not include the final
syllable; further corroboration for my reconstruction comes from Ofayé: j-¸)SE ‘nose’. The final syllable in
Karajá d-EaT´) may be ultimately related to the final syllable in the Apinajé form.
272remained unaccounted for in Davis’ comparison. Additonal lexical evidence, however,
suggests a regular correspondence between Proto-Jê final *k and Karajá /b/:(7)Proto-Jê final *k :: Karajá /b/

one can make well-informed decisions on likely Jê/Karajá cognates even in cases for which a
Proto-Jê form cannot be reconstructed. For instance, although the Central Jê allative
postposition (Xerénte ku, Xavante /u) cannot, so far, be reconstructed for Proto-Jê, it is still
safe to compare it with the allative postposition kO in Karajá. In both Karajá and Central Jê,
the allative postposition is homophonous with the word for ‘wood’ (Karajá kO, Proto-Jê *ko,
Xerénte ku). Also, the locative postposition ki in Kaingáng, so far attested only for the
Southern Branch of the Jê family, can be suggested as a likely cognate of the locative
postposition kI in Karajá.","[280, 281, 282, 283, 284]"
"4. Complementation15The fact that Maia does not signal any pause between both sentences corroborates my analysis of these
examples as cases of subordination, not juxtaposition of two independent clauses (‘the man threw the arrow; he
saw the guariba monkey’), which would be a rather odd construction in Karajá, given the lack of particles
marking any type of relation between the last clause and the preceding one.
16
Maia’s original transcriptions of these examples are (i) weriri Dolora dewinade kau awire and (ii) Hãbu wyhy
rehura asynihiky-my robina. In addition to the overall shortcomings of Karajá orthography, Maia’s
transcription also presents some inaccuracies of its own. For example, the verb ehu ‘to throw’ takes objects
marked with the instrumental postposition èdI, never a ‘bare’ object as Maia’s transcription suggests. This and
other inaccuracies are corrected in (41) and (42) above.
239Complement clauses are those which occupy the position of a noun phrase, occuring
as arguments of the verb or as objects of postpositions. Like relative clauses, complement
clauses in Karajá are also characterized by stress shift. In (43) below, the subordinate clause
is the subject of the main clause, whereas in (44), the subordinate clause is the object of the
verb ♀ kErÈ, ♂ ErÈ ‘to know’.","[250, 251]"
"1698. Concluding remarksThe main purpose of this chapter was to describe the female versus male speech
distinctions in Karajá and to outline some of the questions such a phenomenon may pose to
historical linguistics and sociolinguistics, as well as the implications of such a phenomenon
for the analysis of Karajá phonology and morphology. Although male versus female speech
distinctions are commonly found in the languages of the world, very little is known on how
such distinctions are brought about historically, how they correlate with other social
institutions, and how and why they cease to exist. In this sense, the example of the Karajá
dialects is particularly interesting, for it provides both a situation in which the distinctions are
vigorously preserved and a case in which they seem to have faded away diachronically.
The phenomenon of gender dialects in Karajá illustrates a sui generis case of
language change, whose social and historical motivations constitute a rich theme to be further
explored in future studies. Rather than providing the final word on such a complex and
fascinating topic, I hope the main merit of this chapter is in revealing additional lines of
inquiry. The data suggest that the genesis of such distinctions may be related to an overall
tendency towards voiceless stop lenition, a hypothesis which needs to be further tested as our
comparative knowledge of Macro-Jê improves. There seems to be a strong correlation
between age and the extent to which genderlectal distinctions are carried out by individual
speakers, which begs for additional investigations into how and when such distinctions are
acquired. The possibility of imperfect learning of the peculiarities of each speech within
mixed families—a factor which, as I suggest, may have been at the heart of the weakening of170genderlectal distinctions in Javaé—also deserves further investigation, beyond the anecdotal
(albeit compelling) reports by native speakers. An in-depth investigation into these issues
must be preceded by an accurate description of the data, and it is my hope that this chapter
may represent a substantial contribution towards that goal.","[180, 181, 182]"

possible explanation for the sui generis nature of the phenomenon may be found in the wide
range of pragmatic and discourse functions that may be played by directional marking in
Karajá: as described in Chapter 3, besides its strictly directional use, directional inflection
can be used with evidential purposes, as well as to code empathy relationships between the
participants of the speech act and between narrator and characters in a narrative text.","[59, 60]"
