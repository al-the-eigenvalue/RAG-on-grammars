NOMINALIZATIONS VIA ARTICLES
9.1 NOMINALIZERS
Any adjective in Catalan can function as a noun simply by becoming the head of a noun phrase; this often involves it following an article or a demonstrative (but not
necessarily so). We deal separately below with one product of this process: nominalization of an adjective when a noun is suppressed (9.1.1). Constructions using the
‘neuter’ article el/lo with adjectives are discussed at 9.2.1 and ‘intensification’ of adjectives with el/lo at 27.2.3. Many cases in the first category are as familiar as
nouns as they are as adjectives: els grecs ‘Greek people’, un cec ‘a blind man’/‘a blind person’, un boig ‘a madman’, els vells i els joves ‘the young and the old’,
els exiliats ‘exiles’, etc.","[161, 162]"

PRONOMINAL VERBS
23.1 GENERAL
Pronominal verbs are those which appear with an object pronoun (i.e. em, et, es, ens, us, es, in the appropriate form) of the same person as the subject of the verb:
M’he llevat ‘I got up’, Pentina’t ‘Comb your hair’, Aneu­vos­en ‘Go away’. Verbs in the third person, including vostè(s), take the reflexive pronoun es (s’, ­se,
’s) for both singular and plural. When standing alone or as a verbal noun, the infinitive takes enclitic ­s e or ’s (identificar­s e ‘identify oneself’, renovar­se o morir ‘be
renewed or die’, moure’s ‘move’ (intransitive)), which is how pronominal verbs are given in word lists, dictionaries, etc.
Many Catalan verbs can be used in this way, and there is an important group (see 23.5ii) which exist only in the pronominal form. Older grammars refer to all such
cases as ‘reflexive verbs’, but this is misleading. A true reflexive verb is a transitive one whose direct or indirect object, expressed as a pronoun, is one and the same as
its subject, i.e. a verb expressing an action done by a subject to or for him/herself: M’afaito ‘I have a shave’, Talla’t les ungles ‘Cut your nails’. However only a
small percentage of pronominal verbs have this truly reflexive sense (23.2). Reciprocity is also expressed by this pronominal construction (23.3):
Ens estimem de debò.
We really love each other.
Es van repartir els caramels entre ells.
They shared out the sweets among themselves.
Beyond these two cases (reflexivity and reciprocity) the behaviour of Catalan pronominal verbs cannot be neatly described by reference to English structures.
The subtleties of the Catalan weak­object­pronoun system (discussed in Chapter 12) and the passive or impersonal uses of e s (covered in Chapter 29) affect the
complexity of this phenomenon, as do several other contrasts between Catalan and English. The following points affecting translation are to be borne in mind:
(i) Nuances of the ethic dative (12.3.2.3 and 25.4):
M e’ls vaig trobar al supermercat.
I came across them in the supermarket.","[445, 446]"
"Page 17712.3 PRONOMINAL CLITICS IN USE
12.3.1.1 First­ and second­person object pronouns
First­ and second­person object pronouns combine with the verb as explained in 12.1.1. For both the first and the second persons the forms are undifferentiated for
the accusative (direct object) and for the dative (indirect object) functions. The direct object in Catalan is easily identified (Chapter 25) and its function conforms to that
of its counterpart in English: M’han vist They have seen me’, Heu de creure’ns ‘You must believe us’. The Catalan indirect object, on the other hand, covers a range
of meanings beyond the simple function of dative (see 25.4).
12.3.1.2 Reflexive and pronominal clitics
A particular category is that in which the object pronoun refers to the subject of the verb (as indicated by the verb ending): Em dutxo ‘I’m having a shower’, M’estic
rentant les dents ‘I’m cleaning my teeth’, T’has equivocat ‘You were mistaken’, No us emboliqueu en aquest assumpte ‘Don’t get involved in this matter’.
These reflexive or pronominal verbs are discussed in detail in Chapter 23; the third­person reflexive clitic es is considered at 12.4.","[195, 196]"
"Page 31
GENDER OF NOUNS
Catalan displays the phenomenon of grammatical gender agreement found in many European languages (and elsewhere). Every noun is either of masculine or of
feminine gender; adjectives which modify the noun, as well as pronouns which cross­refer to it, are required to take the same, ‘agreeing’, gender. For example:
Aquell
armari
vell
era ple,
i el
vam haver de
that (m.) cupboard (m.) old (m.) was full (m.), and it (m.) we­had to
buidar.
empty
That old cupboard was full, and we had to empty it.
Aquella
caixa vella
era
plena,
i la vam haver de buidar.
that (f.) box (f.) old (f.) was full (f.), and it (f.) we­had to empty
That old box was full, and we had to empty it.
As is the case in most languages, the masculine gender is semantically ‘unmarked’, in that it is also used when referring to groups of mixed biological gender or to
persons of unknown or unspecified gender:
els italians (m.)
Italian males or Italians in general
els professors (m.)
male teachers or teachers of either sex
els pares (m.)
fathers or parents
els fills (m.)
sons or sons and daughters (male and female) or children (sex unspecified or unknown)
Si algú arriba d’hora, feu­lo (m.) esperar. If anyone arrives early, have them wait.
female teachers
but les professores (f.)In addition to masculine and feminine gender, Catalan is unusual among Romance languages in having a special neuter agreement pronoun ho, used when no noun has
been mentioned or is in mind. Its use is explained in section 12.5.","[21, 22]"
"As in the last example, these complex pronoun groups almost inevitably involve a pronominal verb or use of the ethic dative, present here in me, untranslatable in this
case but expressing the speaker’s moral interest in the situation.
The order of three or more pronouns in combination conforms to the diagram shown in 12.9.2.",[233]
"14.3 COMPOUND PREPOSITIONS AND ‘PREPOSITIONAL EXPRESSIONS’
Syntactically, compound prepositions consist of a noun, adverb, prepositional or other phrase, which is followed by a prepositional phrase complement introduced by a
or, in the majority of cases, de. Unlike the prepositions mentioned in the previous section (14.2.3), here the a or de element is omissible only in very special
circumstances (including generally before the complementizer que in the standard language as in 14.1.5).",[284]
"11.5 STYLE—USE AND OMISSION OF PRONOUNS
11.5.1 SUBJECT PRONOUNS
As mentioned above, subject pronouns are not used in Catalan as often as in English or French. The form of the verb normally suffices to identify the subject. There are
some cases, however, in which the verbal forms for first­and third­person singular coincide, namely in imperfect and conditional tenses (jo cantava—ell/ella/vostè
cantava; jo dormia—ell/ella/vostè dormia; jo dormiria—ell/ella/vostè dormiria) and the context may require the pronouns to be used to avoid confusion.
More generally third­person forms may relate to ‘real’ third­person subjects ‘he/she/it, they’ or they may correspond to ‘you (polite)’, that is, vostè/ vostès. It is
probably only vostè and vostès that are used significantly more often than other subject pronouns: Com te dius? ‘What is your name?’ (familiar address pronoun),
Com se diu vostè? ‘What is your name?’ (polite addressPage 165
pronoun); Com se diu? could mean ‘What is your name?’, but can also mean, e.g., ‘What is it called?’, as well as ‘What is his/her/its name?’
If subject pronouns are used in other cases it will be to convey an emphasis or contrast:
Jo canto bé; tu desentones.
I am singing fine; you are out of tune.
The presence of the pronoun becomes necessary when the verb is elided, of course.
Alguns potser ho aprovaran, però nosaltres mai.
Some people will perhaps approve of it, but we never will.
Despite Catalan’s natural tendency to avoid subject pronouns except in the instances discussed above, there are cases where the subject is reinforced by the use of a
demonstrative (see 6.4) as subject pronoun, where English might just use the normal subject pronoun:
Aquesta era especialitzada en física nuclear.
She/This woman was a specialist in nuclear physics.
Ho vam anunciar públicament però aquells no en van fer cas.
We announced it publicly but they took no notice.","[183, 184]"
"More generally, the use of a before a definite animate direct object is tolerated when its absence might suggest that the noun phrase involved was a subject.
T’estima com a la seva mare.
She loves you like (she loves) her mother.
A Núria, no crec que la pugues convèncer.
I don’t think you can persuade Núria.
Als funcionaris no els satisfà la proposta de la jornada intensiva.
Civil servants are not satisfied by the proposal for continuous working.
In the last two examples, a makes clear that a noun phrase in initial position is not subject but direct object (see 25.3). A is, in fact, generally used with direct objects
which are left­dislocated: see 25.3 and 36.4.
14.1.1.2 A with indirect object
The indirect object of a verb is marked by a:
Han atorgat un premi al millor llibre de contes.
They have awarded a prize to the best book of short stories.
A mi, no m’ho ha dit.
She hasn’t told me.
Escriu a en Pere.
Write to Pere.
Colloquial speech often uses en, amb, or a variant of these, in such cases, but this is regarded as unacceptable in written language, and in formal styles.
14.1.1.3 Expressions of place: a and en
Depending on the context, both a and en may be found expressing place at which (location) and place to which (direction). In the standard language thePage 244
distribution is as set out below. The tendency is for a to be used for both location and direction when physical location is at issue; a also tends to be preferred before
the definite article in both location and direction functions, while, in contrast, en tends to be preferred, in both functions, before the indefinite article, and algun ‘some’,
aquest/aqueix ‘this’ and aquell ‘that’.
(i) Physical location/direction
Firstly, for expressions of location and direction in physical, three­dimensional space, a basic pattern uses en for location and a for direction (to), when the following
word is (a) a noun, (b) an adjective, (c) a numeral, (d) a quantifier/indefinite (except un, algun) or a degree adverb, or (e) a relative pronoun:
before
(a) noun(b) adjective
(c) numeral
(d) quantifier! indefinite (except
un/algun)
(e) relative pronounlocation: en
No trobaren allotjament ni en hotels, ni en pensions, ni en cases
particulars.
They did not find accommodation in hotels, guest houses, or private houses.
Viuen en grans edificis.
They live in large buildings.
He estudiat en tres universitats.
I have been a student at three universities.
Això passa en molts llocs.
That happens in many places.
el pis en el qual (or en què ) vivia
the flat in which I liveddirection (to): a
Anem a sales diferents.
We are going to different rooms.
Viatgem a llunyanes terres.
We are travelling to distant lands.
Els enviem a tres universitats.
We are sending them to three universities.
Pujarem a quasi tots els pisos.
We’ll go up to nearly all the apartments.
la terrassa a la qual (or a què ) hem
pujat
the balcony to which we went upThe use of a instead of en to express location in all of these contexts is quite widespread in both speech and written sources, and is regarded as acceptable in case (d)
particularly with everyday expressions; thus Això passa a cada casaPage 245
‘That happens in every house’, Plou a tot Catalunya ‘It’s raining in the whole of Catalonia’. The use of en for direction before altres is also acceptable: Anirem
aquí i en altres llocs ‘We’ll go there and to other places’.
In addition to a certain degree of merger of the distinction between location and direction in cases (a) to (e) in the table, there is more firmly established neutralization
in the following cases.
A for location=direction: place namesWith place names, location as well as direction is expressed by means of a:
fabricat a Suïssa
La vain enviar a Suïssa.
una acampada al Pirineumade in Switzerland
We sent it to Switzerland.
a camping holiday in the Pyrenees(For location, Valencian prefers en with place names: Ací en València ha plogut ‘Here in Valencia it has been raining’.) Place names with modifying adjectives are
treated as cultural concepts rather than physical locations, hence retain en for location: en la Catalunya actual ‘in present­day Catalonia’, en la Roma antiga ‘in
ancient Rome’. (However, a may be found here too, probably due to the combined pressure of the adjacent definite article and the geographical name.) Names of
periodicals or television/radio stations are often treated as proper names, so he llegit a «Serra d’Or» ‘I read in Serra d’Or’, Publiquem l’article a «Caplletra»
‘We are publishing the article in Caplletra’, Ho he vist a TV3 ‘I saw it on TV3’.
A for location=direction: idioms with a ‘at’A expresses location or direction in certain fixed phrases containing an unmodified noun without a determiner: a casa ‘at home’/‘home’, a palau ‘in/to the palace’, a
taula ‘at/to (the) table’, a fira ‘at/to the fair’, a mercat ‘at/to market’, a missa ‘at/to Mass’, a classe/a escola ‘at/to school’, a muntanya ‘in/to the mountains’, etc.
A terra means ‘on the ground’/‘to the ground’; en terra means ‘on land’ (location or direction).
Què has fet a classe?
Que no has anat a missa?
A taula!","[262, 263, 264]"
"Typical uses of indirect object li/els
The underlying principle is that the indirect object pronouns li/els represent the person (and sometimes the thing) interested in or by the meaning of the verb phrase,
the ‘interest’ being broadly related either to ‘gaining from’ or to ‘losing by’ an action. English will often have ‘to’, ‘for’, or ‘from’ in corresponding phrases. The
examples given below are all translated as referring to ‘him/her/them’, but in virtually every case the translation could be ‘you’ with the pronouns referring to vostè(s).
In the first group of sentences below there is a direct object noun phrase (or noun clause/sentential complement) present as well as the dative/indirect object. (Only in
exceptional circumstances can a Catalan clause have more than one direct object; it can never have more than one indirect object.)
Indirect object and direct object(i) Receiving or acquiring something:
Li vaig entregar el paquet.
Els ensenyarem com s’hi va.
Digueu­li com es fa.
Qui els subministra combustible?
Algú li va atansar el plànol.
Li han hagut de posar una injecció.
Li va merèixer moltes Iloances.
El pare li havia encomanat la seva ambició.
No se’ls ha acudit de denunciar­ho.
Li he promès que ho faré.",[199]
"Per què? ‘why?’ must not be confused with perquè ‘because’:
–Per què has vingut?—Perquè volia veure’t.
‘Why did you come?’ ‘Because I wanted to see you.’
27.1.3.3 Quant?
Quantitative quant? can function as an interrogative adjective, pronoun, or adverb. In the former case agreement with the noun covers the English distinction between
count and non­count nouns ‘how much?’/‘how many?’; as an adverb it is invariable:
How many members have turned up?
How much water is there in the cistern?
How much cheese do we have left?
How much have they worked today?",[508]
"The examples above are to be contrasted with other correct combinations of els with hi, where each component has its own grammatical function. As well as He
demanat els programes al company Els hi he demanat (els=programes, hi (=li)=al company), observe hi as locative in cases like the following: Redactaran
els fullets al despatx ‘They will write the leaflets in the office’ Els hi redactaran; Enviaran els esborranys dels textos als col∙laboradors/a les
col∙laboradores a la facultat ‘They will send the drafts of the texts to the contributors at the faculty’ Els hi enviaran els esborranys dels textos.
12.9.3.6 First­ and second­person pronouns in combination
As shown in the diagram given in 12.9.2, the only possible combination of first­person and second­person pronouns is one in which the second person precedes the
first person. In these the first­person pronoun must be an indirect object (including ethic dative). Thus No te m’enfadis ‘Don’t get angry with me’, Te’ns pots
adreçar en castellà si vols ‘You may address us in Castilian if you wish’, Ja us ens heu cruspit tots els cacauets? ‘Have you scoffed all the peanuts (that we put
out or that we fancied eating)?’ There is no possibility of forming a pronoun group in which a first­person pronoun (direct object or reflexive) precedes a second­
person one. In order, then, to express the idea ‘I shall come closer to you’ (sg. and pl.) Catalan resorts to a strong pronoun for the indirect object ‘to you’:
M’acostaré a tu/a vosaltres. Likewise, Ens confessarem a tu/a vosaltres ‘We shall confess to you’. While there is perhaps no theoretical objection to ?Me li
acostaré or ?Me’ls acostaré, ?Ens li confessarem or ?Ens els confessarem, with li/els (grammatically third person) standing for vostè(s) (semantically second
person), in practice the strong pronoun construction invariably replaces the weak pronouns thus, M’acostaré a vostè(s) (or M’hi acostaré with a vostè(s) taken as
a location rather than as an indirect object), Ens confessarem a vostè(s).
12.9.3.7 Pronominal verbs with clitic groups
The regularity with which the ethic dative occurs in Catalan (see 12.3.2.3vi, 23.1i and 25.4) together with the wide repertoire of pronominal verbs (Chapter 23 in
general) means that many clitic groups are headed by a pronoun with one or other of these functions. Such combinations may involve an ethicPage 212
dative or a reflexive element, a pronominal verb with an inanimate subject (as discussed in 23.4) or impersonal e s (see 29.2):
Ethic dative:
No t’ho prenguis així.
Ja ens en comprarem.","[230, 231]"
"12.9.3 TABLE OF TWO­PRONOUN GROUPS
The table given on pp. 204–5 (adapted from Badia, Gramàtica) shows the combination and spelling of all two­pronoun groups. The following observations will
facilitate consultation.
First­ and second­person pronouns (i.e. em, et, ens, us) are undifferentiated for direct object and indirect object functions; third­person forms (identical for vostè
(s)) are differentiated according to function (e.g. li, indirect object singular m. and f.; el, direct object singular m.; els, direct object plural m.; els, indirect object plural
m. and f.).
Each box contains the result of combining the head of each horizontal row with the head of each vertical column. Four combinations are given in each box, even
when some are identical. The numbers 1–4 in each box correspond to the four situations affecting pronunciation and spelling according to whether the group stands:
1 after a verb ending in a consonant or semivowel ­u
2 after a verb ending in a vowel (excluding semivowel ­u)
3 before a verb beginning in a consonant
4 before a verb beginning in a vowel or h­
The forms presented in the table are those which are recognized as correct and universally applicable in the standard written language. The Valencian solution for
li+another [l]­base third­person pronoun (row VII) has some currency in the literary language, alongside the more widespread solution shown in row VI a­d; see
12.9.3.3. Informal written registers and colloquial usage diverge considerably from the pattern of the formal standard which is based on eastern dialects, particularly the
language of Barcelona and environs. These deviations from the standard, already introduced in relationPage 203
to single pronouns, are discussed in general terms in the sections following the table.
Note that the logical combination of direct object ho+adverbial hi is in fact realized l’hi: see 12.9.3.4iv.
12.9.3.1 Formation of two­pronoun groups
The table on pp. 204–5 supplies the model for every combination of two pronominal clitics according to the point of contact with the verb and its
pronunciation/spelling. It would be tiresome and redundant to provide an example of each single one of the more than three hundred instances laid out in the table.
What follows below is a relatively full sample of cases involving first­person singular indirect objects (em, ens), in combination with various third­person direct objects.
The sentences Em llegiràs l’anunci ‘You will read the notice to me’ and M’has llegit l’anunci ‘You have read the notice to me’ correspond to M e’l llegiràs
‘You will read it to me’ and Me l’has llegit ‘You have read it to me’ when the direct object (l’anunci) is represented by a pronoun. Similarly Llegeix­me l’anunci
and Llegeixi’m (vostè) l’anunci ‘Read the notice to me’ correspond to Llegeix­me’l and Llegeixi­me’l. Then, with feminine direct objects (singular la proposta
‘the proposal’, plural les propostes), we have:
Me la llegiràs.
Me l’has llegit/llegida.
Llegeix­me­la.
Llegeixi­me­la.","[221, 222]"
"Page 41521.2.1 SYNTAX OF PRESENT PARTICIPLE
The present participle is basically an adjective, and it is thus to be carefully distinguished from the gerund (see above bullent vs. bullint, vinent vs. venint, and also
22.1.2 and 22.2.4.2) whose function is fundamentally verbal. The present participle, then, is used to qualify a noun (and, like other adjectives, can itself be used,
‘pronominally’, as, for example, els creients ‘believers’). The point is reinforced by considering the adjectival value of suplent (‘substitute’, ‘deputy’, present
participle of transitive suplir ‘substitute’, ‘stand in’) contrasted with the verbal function of gerund suplint (taking its own direct object) in the following pair:
Hem tingut un professor suplent.
We’ve had a stand­in teacher.
Hem tingut un professor nou suplint el nostre.
We’ve had a new teacher standing in for our usual one.
In the first case the adjectival suplent is tied closely in position after its noun, whereas the suplint clause has mobility within the sentence:
Suplint el nostre hem tingut un professor nou.
Hem tingut, suplint el nostre, un professor nou.
Many words in ­nt are not strictly speaking participles but rather non­verbal adjectives: aparent, corrent, brillant, bastant, etc. While new ­nt present participles are
constantly being formed and becoming established, for example, canviant. ‘changing’, relaxant ‘relaxing’, they cannot be coined from any verb at will. English
speakers must thus avoid the temptation to invent equivalents of English adjectival present participles in ‘­ing’ along the lines of *movent. (Note peces mòbils ‘moving
parts’, un discurs commovedor ‘a moving speech’.) This can be seen in common instances like plegable ‘folding’, aigua potable ‘drinking water’, plantes
enfiladisses ‘climbing plants’. In other cases, a Catalan (past) participle corresponds to English words in ‘­ing’:
ajagut
assegut
atrevit
avorrit/ensopit
cansatlying
sitting
daring
boring
tiringdivertit
dormit
entretingut
pesat
suatamusing
sleeping, asleep
entertaining
boring, irritating
sweating, hotEnglish speakers should also avoid the temptation to introduce the present participle (or gerund) in constructions where English ‘­ing’ corresponds to a relative clause in
Catalan (see 22.1.2, 22.3.1, and 31.10i).","[433, 434]"
"Loosen her seat­belt.
It must have cost them a packet.
Someone was treading on his feet.
The excitement made his member swell.
Their car had broken down.
We’ll look after the/his dog for him.(vi) Indicating a person’s involvement in or being closely affected by a verbal action. This device is characteristic of colloquial and familiar contexts, when the speaker
displays strong affective involvement in what they are talking about. The effect and nuances of this ‘ethic dative’ in Catalan (see 25.4) are very often difficult to convey
in English. The preposition ‘on’ (‘on me’, ‘on you’, ‘on him’, etc.) sometimes has the same force in colloquial English, but in translation the effect will usually be
transposed to (or from) another part of the English sentence:Page 182
El nen se’ls estava posant molt fresc.
Their child was getting very cheeky with them.
El seu mark se li està quedant primíssim.
Her husband’s getting terribly thin.
As in the examples above, this construction frequently involves combination of two (or more) pronoun clitics. The whole question of combination of pronouns is
covered in 12.9.
The second group of sentences, containing an indirect but no direct object, are perhaps more tricky for English speakers. In nearly every case the subject is
inanimate or impersonal: such verbs are usually regarded as ‘intransitive’ (see 25.4).
Indirect object but no direct object(i) Receiving or acquiring something:
A veure si li toca un premi.
Els correspon la meitat dels beneficis.
Li interessa saber­ho.
No li sembla que…?
No els convenia que s’anunciés.
El clima no li provava.
Els sonava malament.
Li és igual.
Li consta que…
Què li passa?
No li agrada això?
Els va caure bé el guia.
I ara li sap molt de greu.
Els arribava una pudor d’oli barat.","[200, 201]"
"This dative construction is usual with parts of the body, clothing, and other personal effects. In the case of personal effects and clothing, alternative use of the possessive
adjective is possible:
He deixat la teva cartera a l’armari./T’he deixat la cartera a l’armari.
I’ve left your briefcase in the cupboard.
The possessive adjective may also be used when the thing possessed is emphasized or particularized by context, by an adjective or other words, or when ambiguity is
to be avoided:
I took hold of her trembling hand.",[138]

Són coses que sempre hauríem de tenir presents, (standard)
They are things which we should always bear in mind.
In these last two examples the weak pronoun—strictly redundant (see 12.8) picks up the simple direct object function of que (see 33.3.4.1). The pattern is least
common when, as here, the relative pronoun is a direct object. The phenomenon may sometimes be found in writing, particularly if several words separate the relative
pronoun from the verb which affects it:
Ara et faré una confessió que mai abans no m’havia atrevit a fer­la a ningú. (non­standard)
Ara et faré una confessió que mai abans no m’havia atrevit a fer a ningú. (standard)

Els gramàtics aconsellen moltes construccions que en la llengua viva la gent no les usa. (non­standard)
Els gramàtics aconsellen moltes construccions que en la llengua viva la gent no usa. (standard)
Grammarians recommend many constructions that people do not use in the living language.
With other roles than direct object within the relative clause, the pattern is common in spontaneous casual speech, but, again, is avoided in writing.
un jugador de rugby que li han operat el fèmur (non­standard)
un jugador de rugby a qui/al qual han operat el fèmur (standard)
a rugby­player who has had a thigh operation
una tela que se’n fan cortines (non­standard)
una tela de què/de la qual es fan cortines (standard)
a material which curtains are made from
un home que mai no li surten bé les coses (non­standard)
un home a qui/al qual mai no li surten bé les coses (standard)
a man who things never turn out right for
When the relative pronoun has the role of possessor (object of the preposition de) the non­standard construction with expanded que is frequently found (sometimes
with the possessive adjective introducing the object of possession):
un poble que totes les cases són d’una sola planta (non­standard)
a town whose/where the houses are all single­storeyedPage 538
el matrimoni vell que el fill major estudia a Lleida (non­standard)
the old couple whose eldest son is studying in Lleida
Són amics de tota la vida que coneixem massa bé les seves debilitats. (non­standard)
They’re lifelong friends whose weaknesses we know only too well.
The last group displays avoidance of the possessive relative formed with de+ compound el qual (see 31.5), with which construction the standard versions would be:
un poble totes les cases del qual…, el matrimoni veil el fill major del qual…,…amics de tota la vida les debilitats dels quals…
In informal style que can stand for a preposition+relative pronoun, provided its antecedent is governed by the same preposition:
Amb els amics que sortia abans, vaig arribar a avorrir­m’hi molt.
I got very bored with the friends I used to go around with.
Dels projectes que et vam parlar, més val que ens n’oblidem.
We might as well forget about the plans we talked to you about.
Als llocs que ja has anat, no val la pena de tornar­hi.
There’s no point in going back to places you’ve been to already.
This construction is not conventionally included in the non­standard set discussed above (though some grammarians might feel it belongs there). On relative pronouns
governed by prepositions, see 31.3 and 31.4.2.","[555, 556, 557]"
"Page 46325.4 INDIRECT OBJECTS
Except in the third person, the indirect object unstressed (clitic) personal pronouns are the same as the direct object ones (12.3.2.3). The third­person indirect object
clitics are li (sg.) and els/los (pl., both genders). Stressed indirect object pronouns, and other types of indirect object noun phrases, are marked with the preposition a.
El govern no concedeix prou importància als petits empresaris.
The government does not grant enough importance to small businessmen.
El govern no els concedeix prou importància.
The government does not grant them enough importance.
As with direct objects, a personal pronoun indirect object must always be represented by a clitic pronoun, even if a stressed personal pronoun is also present:
No li han ensenyat a vostè les cartes que Foix em va escriure?
Have they not shown you the letters Foix wrote me?
Després us ho explicarem a vosaltres.
Afterwards we’ll explain it to you.
In certain cases, though not all,—the constraints are not yet well understood—an indirect object which is inanimate can be represented by the ‘locative’ clitic hi. This
usage is illustrated in 12.7ii.
When an indirect object phrase is placed before the verb, in a dislocation construction, it is usual to ‘double’ it with a clitic pronoun.
A l’home(,) l’experiència li ha ensenyat...
Man has learnt by experience, (lit. To man, experience has taught him…)
Als meus germans, això no els importa gaire.
My brothers and sisters are not very worried about that. (lit. To my brothers, that does not matter much to them.)
In informal styles, this pattern of clitic doubling occurs also in relative clauses and wh­questions, and even when the phrasal indirect object is in its normal post­verbal
position. Some grammarians regard this not just as informal, but as non­standard.
?A qui li enviarem la llista de preus.
?els clients a qui els vam enviar la llista
?L’Enric li va donar una rosa a la Rosa.
?Li ho direm al teu germà.","[481, 482]"

DEMONSTRATIVES
6.1 GENERAL
The demonstrative adjectives and pronouns in Catalan are identical in form, that is, aquest followed by a (m.sg.) noun means ‘this’, while standing alone it means ‘this
one’ (m.); likewise, aquelles means ‘those’ or ‘those ones’ (f.pl.) (see 6.4). In this respect demonstrative adjectives resemble other adjectives in Catalan, which can
be used pronominally. The neuter demonstrative pronouns açò, això, and allò are discussed in 6.5.
Modern Catalan has a binary system of demonstratives with a basis somewhat different from that found in modern English (where ‘this’/‘these’ indicates closeness to
the speaker and ‘that’/‘those’ indicates remoteness). It is convenient to see this in relation to the three ‘persons’ of verbal conjugation. The standard language
differentiates between aquest, referring to something close, in time or space, to the speaker (first person) and to the person addressed (second person). Aquell,
resembling old English ‘yonder’, refers to something remote from both speaker and hearer/reader. Thus, in the sentence No m’agrada aquest abric ‘I don’t like
this/that overcoat’, the demonstrative aquest could indicate the overcoat worn by either the speaker or the hearer. (Where context did not make the meaning clear,
clarification would be supplied by gesture or by supplementary comment like que portes avui ‘that you are wearing today’.) The point to be observed is that aquest
translates ‘this’ and also ‘that’ where the latter refers to something close to a second person. Aquell, on the other hand, conveys the idea of ‘that’ when remoteness
from the speaker and hearer/reader is involved, either in space (aquell abric que porta en Xavier ‘that overcoat which Xavier is wearing’) or in time (aquell abric
que portava (jo)/portaves (tu) l’altre dia ‘that overcoat which I was/you were wearing the other day’). Detailed discussion is given at 6.3.
Section 6.3.1 covers exceptions to the normal positioning of a demonstrative adjective, in front of the noun it qualifies: aquest gos ‘this dog’, aquelles coses ‘those
things’.","[124, 125]"
"Page 382.2.3 COUNT NOUNS AND MASS NOUNS
Count nouns refer to countable items like ‘fingers’, ‘eggs’, ‘journeys’; mass nouns refer to non­countable items like ‘bread’, ‘justice’. Though we can in English use
mass nouns (especially in the plural) to mean ‘types of…’ or ‘instances of…’, e.g. ‘French wines’, ‘her fears’, this is rather more common in Catalan. More generally,
mass and count terms in the two languages may not match:

thunderclaps2.3 DIMINUTIVE, AUGMENTATIVE, AND EVALUATIVE SUFFIXES
There are a number of suffixes which, as well as carrying connotations of size, can give an affective note to the basic meaning of the root word. The principal ones are ­
et/­eta (diminutive), ­às/­assa (augmentative), ­ot/­ota (pejorative). The use of such suffixes in adjectives is dealt with in 4.1.5. Addition of a suffix may entail some
morphological change in the root word, of the kind described above at 2.1.3 and elsewhere (5.3.2, etc.): home ‘man’, homenet ‘little man’; mà ‘hand’, manassa ‘big
hand’.
In some cases these suffixes convey no affective colouring, creating derived forms which are independent lexical items. Such derived forms may occasionally be of
different gender from the base: avió (m.) ‘aircraft’, avioneta (f.) ‘light aircraft’; camió (m.) ‘lorry’, camioneta (f.) ‘van’, ‘light truck’; vagó (m.) ‘wagon’, ’coach‘,
’(railway) carriage‘, vagoneta (f.) ’small wagon‘, ’open railway truck’; maleta (f.) ‘suitcase’, maletí (m.) ‘attaché case’. The ending ­ot (see below) is used for the
masculine of certain species nouns that are feminine: abella ‘bee’, abellot ‘drone’.
Otherwise these suffixes occur frequently in speech and in informal written registers, and they are (especially the diminutives) very productive. They can communicate
a wide range of nuances—affection, condescension, contempt, admiration, irony, repugnance, and so on—and they are observed to bePage 39
instinctively deployed by native speakers with considerable subtlety. Sensitiv­ity and resourcefulness are required in their interpretation and translation: Posi’m dos
enciams, si us plau is the straightforward way of asking politely for two lettuces, whereas Posi’m dos enciamets could imply a certain friendliness between speaker
and hearer as well as a mild appreciation of the (required or observed) quality of the lettuces (understood as well to be smaller rather than larger). As another example,
llibrot (from llibre ‘book’) could, according to context, be either an unwieldy and unattractive book, or a relatively large one whose size is subjectively emphasized.
There is a degree of regional variation in the kinds of derived words that are produced, and in their usage. Moreover, while most nouns could in theory take any suffix,
many theoretically possible derivations are blocked in practice. An account like that provided by Anthony Gooch, in Diminutive, Augmentative and Pejorative
Suffixes in Modern Spanish (Oxford 1970), is much needed for Catalan.","[56, 57, 58]"
"In impersonal constructions with es, when the verb is transitive and the object is plural, the verb agrees in number with the object. Historically the semantic object
became the grammatical subject (whence number agreement) and the reflexive pronoun e s bore the role of the grammatical direct object. However, it is debatable
whether such an analysis is realistic for the contemporary language.",[478]
"7.3 POSSESSIVE PRONOUNS
Possessives which take the definite article (i.e. all except llur(s) and the weak forms) can, like any adjectives, be used pronominally. The distinction between the
adjectival or pronominal function depends on whether, in context, the possessive stands for a specific noun, as discussed in 7.1.1:
Quin paraigua agafem, el meu o el teu?
Which umbrella shall we take, mine or yours?
Les vostres (e.g. cortines) no són les blanques?
Aren’t yours the white ones?
Aquesta cartera és la meva.
This wallet is mine/my one.
In some cases context alone is sufficient to indicate which noun is implied, and the English translation will be more explicit:
Acabo de rebre la teva del 18 de juliol.
I have just received your (letter) of July 18.
els nostres
our relatives, members of our group
There are a number of idiomatic expressions involving pronominal possessives, where the reference is to a notional cosa ‘thing’. For example: sortir­s ePage 118
amb la seva ‘to have one’s way’, dir la seva ‘to have one’s say’, Ja n’has feta una de les teves ‘You’ve been up to your usual tricks’; see 3.4.
The possessive is occasionally introduced by the neuter article el or demonstrative això/allò (see 6.5 and 9.2):
Que cadascú pagui el seu.
Tot el meu és vostre.
Allò teu va ser molt divertit.","[136, 137]"
"Page 46225.3 DIRECT OBJECTS
Personal pronouns have unstressed (clitic) direct object forms distinct from subject forms (Chapter 12). Other noun phrases generally take no special form as direct
objects, but the preposition a is used before direct object noun phrases in certain limited contexts. See 14.1.1.1 for details. To the cases mentioned there we may add
that dislocated (Chapter 36) direct object phrases which denote people require the preposition a:
A Kristeva i als seus seguidors, els preocupaven més les implicacions semiòtiques.
Kristeva and her followers were more concerned with the semiotic implications.
–Satisfà que hi hagi un comitè de direcció?—A molts escriptors, no.
‘Is it enough that there should be a management committee?’ ‘For many writers, it isn’t.’ (lit. Does it satisfy…? (To) many writers, no.)
Ja sé com l’hai d’amoixar, a Na Rosó. (J.Ruyra)
Now I know how to flatter her, (that is,) Rosó.
In Balearic this usage extends to inanimate direct objects which are left­dislocated:
A ses tovalloles, posa­les dins es calaix.","[480, 481]"
"Page 286
In Conjugation III verbs whose stems end in a vowel, the diaeresis will appear over ­i­ in the ending. By general spelling rule, an acute accent to mark required stress
overrides a diaeresis (37.5.1). By special convention, the diaeresis is omitted from Conjugation III verbs in the gerund, the infinitive, and the future and conditional
(whose forms are based on the infinitive). These three points can be illustrated from the conjugation of agrair ‘to thank’: present indicative 1pl. agraïm, 2pl. agraïu;
participle agraït/agraïda/ agraïts/agraïdes; imperfect agraïa, agraïes, agraíem, agraíeu, agraïen; preterite agraí, agraïres, agraírem, agraíreu, agraïren; but
gerund agraint, future agrairé, conditional agrairia, etc. Specifically Valencian variants with the diaeresis are: present indicative agraïx, agraïxes, agraïxen; present
subjunctive agraïsca, agraïsques, agraïsquen; past subjunctive agraïra, agraïres, agraïren.
The diaeresis is regularly used over ­u­ when ­q­ or ­g­ precedes to indicate that the ­u­ is not just a ‘silent’ graphic device. It thus appears regularly in verbs such as
adequar with /kw/, and enaiguar with / w/, whenever the stem is followed by ­e­ or ­i­, hence adeqüem, enaigüés, etc.
Exceptionally, and rather inconsistently, ­ü­ is used in two verbs, argüir and aguar to indicate that the ­u­ is syllabic. Argüir has ­ü­ throughout its paradigm (and as
it is a Conjugation III verb with a vowel­final stem, we get a sequence of diaereses ­üï­ in several of its forms, such as argüïa). In aguar the ­u­ is written with an
accent ­ú­ when it is stressed, otherwise with a diaeresis ­ü­when it precedes ­e­ or ­i­. Because the stressed vowel is marked, the unstressed ­i­ of the present
subjunctive needs no diaeresis. (In fact the anomalous use of diacritics on this rare verb creates more problems than it solves.)16.1.4 WRITTEN ACCENTS
On verbs, as on other words, the normal function of the acute or grave accent is to mark the position of word stress, coupled with the closed or open vowel quality in
the case of ­e­ or ­o­. In a few cases, the function of the written accent, on a word which would not require one by the normal spelling rules, is to distinguish homonyms
(see 37.5.3). There are a few verb forms so marked. They are the following:
from anar, 2sg. imperative vés (distinguished from ves 2sg. imperative of veure ‘see’);
from donar, 2sg. present indicative dónes (not usually Val. 2sg. present subjunctive dones), 3sg. present indicative/2sg. imperative dóna (to distinguish from sg.
dona, pl. dones ‘woman’);
from fer, 3sg. preterite féu (distinguished from 2pl. present indicative feu), and, in Balearic, 2sg. imperative fé (distinguished from fe ‘faith’);Page 287
from moldre, participle mòlt, mòlta, mòlts, mòltes (to distinguish from the quantifier adjective molt ‘many’/‘much’);
from saber, 1sg. present indicative sé (to distinguish from the reflexive pronoun s e);
from ser/ésser, 1sg. present indicative sóc (distinguished from soc ‘tree­stump’), 1sg. present indicative só (distinguished from so ‘sound’), 3sg. present indicative
és (distinguished from reflexive pronoun e s), 1sg./3sg. past subjunctive/conditional fóra (distinguished from fora ‘out’);
from tenir, 3sg. present indicative and 2sg. imperative té (distinguished from 2sg. personal pronoun te);
from venir, 2sg. present indicative véns, 3pl. present indicative vénen (distinguished from the corresponding forms vens, venen from vendre ‘sell’), and in
Balearic, additionally vénc 1sg. present indicative, véngui 1sg./3sg. present subjunctive, etc. (Here the corresponding forms in the General variety have stem vowel i:
vinc, vingui, etc.);
from veure, 3sg. preterite véu (distinguished from 3sg. present indicative veu, and from veu ‘voice’).
Though in other respects compound verbs have the same form of the root as the simple verb they are based on, ‘contrastive’ accents are retained on compounds only
to the extent that the contrast remains (or unless required by regular spelling rules). Thus desfer has 3sg. preterite desféu (distinguished from 2pl. present indicative
desfeu); contenir, retenir have 3sg. present indicative conté, reté respectively, because the accent is now required to mark stress on the final syllable; prevenir has
2sg. present indicative prevens and 3pl. present indicative prevenen, but revenir has revéns, revénen, distinct from revens, revenen from revendre ‘resell’;
preveure has 3sg. preterite prevéu (distinguished from 3sg. present indicative preveu); remoldre ‘regrind’ has participle remòlt, remòlta, remòlts, remòltes for
no very good reason.
On the other hand, regular spelling rules may require accents on compounds which are not required on simple verbs; thus from desfer, 2sg. present indicative
desfàs, 3sg. present indicative desfà; from prevenir 3sg. present indicative prevé (but venir 3sg. present indicative ve); from confondre participle confós (m.sg.);
from descosir, 3sg. present indicative descús; from reprendre 3sg. present indicative reprèn. In these cases the accent indicates final syllable stress on a word
ending in a vowel or ­s or ­n.
Reflecting pronunciation, western dialects and Valencian in particular may have ­é­ in verb forms corresponding to ­è­ of other varieties. In Valencian this applies to
all verb forms; so General atényer, empènyer, estrènyer, conèixer, aparèixer, crèiem, dèiem, fèiem, admès, atès, imprès, etc., are in Valencian atényer,
empényer, estrényer, conéixer, aparéixer, créiem, déiem, féiem, admés, atés, imprés, etc.","[304, 305, 306]"

This book is designed to provide an up­to­date, systematic description of the morphology and syntax of the modern standard Catalan language. In preparing it we have
had in mind the needs of pre­university and university students, teachers, translators and those with a private or professional interest in the language as it is currently
used by Catalan speakers in educated conversation and in the normal range of written registers. We note with pleasure the appearance of Jenny Brumme’s Praktische
Grammatik der katalanischen Sprache (Wilhelmsfeld: Egert, 1997); we coincide with the aims and scope of this work in offering a substantial grammar of Catalan, in
a language other than Spanish or Catalan itself, designed expressly for non­natives. Brumme’s work was published when the present volume was in the final stages of
preparation, so we have been unable to make use of it in our own work. We have, of course, relied considerably on the extensive existing literature on Catalan
grammar, though we have developed some topics which have not previously been covered in depth. We have also given particular emphasis to areas of usage which
are likely to be difficult for users starting from English.
One assumption with which we have worked is that those who use this book, whether for reference or for systematic study, will already have acquired some basic
familiarity with Catalan, either through immediate contact and ‘total immersion’ or, more probably, through working with various methods (in the medium of English,
Spanish or Catalan itself) for induction in the language. This Comprehensive Grammar is thus conceived as an extension or complement to a fairly wide repertoire of
basic study materials, a sample of which is provided in the Further reading list. Another, related, assumption is that users of this book will be acquainted with basic
traditional grammatical concepts and terminology; we aim to explain any more specialized concepts and terms as we go along. Such explanations can be located via the
index.
Catalan is a member of the Romance family of languages which are modern forms of the Latin language which spread from Rome to much of Europe in the wake of
the Roman empire around the beginning of the common era. As its geographical position might suggest, Catalan shares several features with its nearest Romance
neighbours: Italian, Sardinian, Occitan, Spanish, while being distinct in several respects from all of them. The map on page xviii shows where Catalan is spoken and
identifies the main dialect divisions. The second section of this Preface briefly discusses ‘normative’ and ‘standard’ Catalan in relation to the position of the language in
the twentieth centuryPage x
and insofar as these important concepts affect criteria and procedures followed in the body of this book. We do not attempt to supply here any history of Catalan as a
member of the Romance family of languages, or any discussion of the mightily complex issues of Catalan as a stateless language in post­Renaissance Europe, in
contact/conflict with more powerful linguistic neighbours (primarily Spanish, but also French, and Italian). These sociolinguistic and politico­linguistic factors have been
of great moment in shaping the historical evolution of Catalan and, especially in the twentieth century, in affecting the politics associated with community self­awareness
centred in linguistic difference.
The territories where Catalan is natively spoken are:
(1) The Principality of Andorra.
(2) In France: almost all of the département of Pyrénées­Orientales.
(3) In Spain:
(i) Catalonia (under the autonomous government, the Generalitat, of Catalonia), except for the Gascon­speaking Val d’Aran.
(ii) The eastern fringe of Aragon.
(iii) Most of the Comunitat Valenciana, excepting some regions in the west and south which have been Aragonese/Spanish­speaking since at least the
eighteenth century,
(iv) El Carxe, a small area of the province of Murcia, settled in the nineteenth century.
(v) The Balearic Islands: Majorca and Minorca (Balearic stricto sensu), Ibiza (Eivissa) and Formentera (strictly Illes Pitiüses).
(4) In Italy: the port of Alghero in Sardinia.
A conservative estimate of the number of native speakers of Catalan is about 6.5 million (based on the 1991 census in Catalonia, Valencia, and the Balearics, with
estimates for the remaining territories). Within Spain a further three million claim to understand Catalan. Partly as a result of the incorporation of Catalan locally into the
education system, there are within Spain increasing numbers of second­language speakers.","[7, 8, 9, 10, 11]"
"16.5 INFLECTIONAL CATEGORIES OF THE VERB
The non­finite verb categories are infinitive (16.5.1), gerund (16.5.2), and (past) participle (16.5.3); by definition these lack expression of person (agreement with
subject of the verb). The (past) participle takes adjective­type inflections of number and gender (agreeing with the surface subject of a passive verb, and in certain
contexts with the object of a verb in the perfect, see 21.1.2). The use of the infinitive is discussed in Chapter 20, the use of the gerund in Chapter 22, and the use of the
participle in Chapter 21. The so­called present participle is also dealt with in Chapter 21.
Finite verbs agree with the subject in person (1, 2, 3) and number (singular or plural) (16.5.4).
Tense categories are present, past, future. The expression of present and past overlaps with the expression of mood and aspect. (For usage, see Chapter 17.)
The mood categories are indicative, imperative, and subjunctive. The indicative combines with all tenses (present: 16.5.5, past: 16.5.6, future: 16.5.7), but the
imperative (16.5.11) is found only allied with present tense, and the subjunctive only with present (16.5.9) and past tense (16.5.10). (For the use of the subjunctive, see
Chapter 19; for the use of the imperative, see Chapter 28.)
The aspect categories are perfective and imperfective; they are distinguished only in the past tense (16.5.6), and only marginally in the subjunctive mood (16.5.10).
Preterite is the conventional name for the past perfective indicative, while imperfect is the conventional name for the past imperfective indicative. (For the use of the
aspectually marked categories, see 17.1.3.1.)
Perfect and conditional do not fit neatly into the framework of tense, aspect, and mood. Perfect in Catalan (16.5.12) is expressed periphrasticallyPage 294
via the auxiliary verb haver (sometimes ser in North Catalan and esser in Balearic) with the participle of the verb in question. Perfect combines with all of the
categories of tense, aspect, and mood (also with conditional) except that there is no perfect imperative. (For the use of the perfect, see 17.2.2.) The conditional
(16.5.8) is morphologically related to both the future and the (past) imperfect, and one of its uses is as a relative tense ‘future in the past’. (For the use of the
conditional, see 17.1.5 and Chapter 34.)16.5.1 INFINITIVE
The forms of the infinitive have been illustrated above in the presentation of Conjugation classes (16.2 and see 20.1). The infinitive is the citation form of a verb in
Catalan; for example it provides the heading for dictionary entries. This practice has one unfortunate consequence for the learner, as in nearly all cases (all of
Conjugation I and III) the stem of a verb is unstressed in the infinitive form. Due to the reorganization of the vowel system in unstressed syllables (38.1.2), it is thus
usually not possible to identify from a phonetic transcription of the dictionary entry of a verb (the infinitive), whether the quality of a stem ­e­ or ­o­ is open or closed. A
few dictionaries, such as the Diccionari català­francès francès­català published by Enciclopèdia Catalana, SA, do provide this information.
Corresponding to Conjugation II infinitives in stressed ­er (16.2.2iv), colloquial speech often uses variants in ­guer, which are not admitted in writing, for example
volguer (non­standard) corresponding to standard voler.
In varieties other than Valencian, the final ­r of an infinitive is not pronounced except when a clitic pronoun is attached, as in e.g. cobrar­ho, cobrar­les, cobrar­
nos, cobrar­ne. In the informal styles of some regions, the final ­r of the unstressed ­er ending of certain class II verbs is not pronounced even before clitic pronouns,
and this is admitted in less formal writing. The clitic takes the form it would have after a ­re infinitive (see 12.1.3). Thus:

infinitive.","[312, 313, 314]"
"In positive statements and in questions haver­hi can be used with a definite noun phrase following (els documents, en Pere, in examples above). However, haver­hi
cannot appear in a negative statement with a noun phrase inPage 522

"Page 61237.3.2 SPELLING ALTERNATION: WORD­FINAL VERSUS WORD­INTERNAL POSITION
Some contrasts in consonant pronunciation which are observed in word­internal position are obliterated word­finally; so the distinction between [z] in casos ‘cases’
and [s] in passos ‘steps’ is lost in the singular of these words: cas and pas respectively. If we start from the dictionary form of such words, then we have to learn
which words undergo a spelling change when a suffix is added. (Good dictionaries provide this information.) There are elements of pure convention involved, too.
Where we might expect j or tj to occur word­finally, ig (or just g if the preceding stem vowel is i) is used.
Word­final ­s corresponds to word­internal ­s­ ([z]) in many words, but to ­ss­ ([s]) in many others. There are large numbers of both kinds:
cas
pis

afectuós
pas
esbós

(also before inflectional ­s). (B, d, and g are, however, written after consonants and unstressed vowels, as in corb ‘curved’, verd ‘green’, llarg ‘long’, àrab ‘Arabic’,
vàlid ‘valid’, teòleg ‘theologian’.)

"37.5 WRITTEN ACCENT: ACUTE ‘AND ‘GRAVE
37.5.1 BASIC FUNCTION OF WRITTEN ACCENTS
The acute and grave accents are used on vowel letters, both upper­ and lower­case. The basic function of these signs is to indicate, in a word of more than one
syllable, that the stressed syllable is not that which would be expected by the general rules.
The general stress rules are:Page 615
(i) Stress falls on the next to last syllable of:
(a) a word ending in a vowel (but not a diphthong): festa, indico, refia, taxi, retreure
(b) a word ending in a vowel (not a diphthong)+s: ostres, vicis, tipus, recreïs, desitjos
(c) a word ending in ­en or ­in: origen, refien, desitgin, androgin
(ii) Stress falls on the last syllable otherwise; that is, in:
(a) a word ending in a diphthong or a diphthong+s: espai, espais, estiu, estius, enrenou
(b) a word ending in ­an, ­on, ­un: estan, volaran, segon, algun
(c) a word ending in any other single consonant except s, any group of consonants: final, estimat, unicorn, despatx, costums
In all cases which depart from the general stress rules above the stress is indicated with a written accent on the vowel of the stressed syllable. Two accent marks are
used: only the acute is used on í and ú and only the grave on à. On the other vowels, e and o, the acute and grave accents mark phonemic distinctions. (These
phonemic distinctions are not represented at all when a written accent is not required.) Thus é corresponds to /e/, è to / /; ó corresponds to /o/, ò to / /.
All words whose stress falls on the antepenultimate syllable bear a written accent: màquina ‘machine’, església ‘church’, pèrdues ‘losses’, síl∙laba ‘syllable’,
fórmula ‘formula’, anònimes ‘anonymous’ (f.pl).
Other examples, with final syllable stressed, by exception to the general stress rules:
sofà
puré
ressò
espès
abússofa
purée
echo
thick (m.sg.)
abuseenténunderstands (3rd­person singular present of entendre)pliocèn
esplínPliocene
spleenBecause of the regular application of the accent rules it is quite common for a noun or adjective which has a written accent in the (masculine) singular to lack one in the
plural or the feminine, for example:
sg.
camí
serè
pagès
oportúpl.
camins
serens
pagesos
oportunspath
serene (m.), and thus serena, serenes (f.sg. and pl.)
farmer
timely (m.), and thus oportuna, oportunes (f.sg. and pl.)Page 616
Much less often a noun or adjective which lacks an accent in the (m.) singular requires one in the plural or feminine. These are words ending in ­en or ­in, singular
stress rule (i)c:
fenomen
origen
misoginfenòmens
orígens
misòginsphenomenon
origin
misogynous (m.sg., m.pl., f.sg.)misòginaAdverbs in ­ment which are derived from adjectives bearing an accent retain the accent, corresponding to secondary stress:
critically
easilycríticament
fàcilmentExcept in this case, the position of secondary stress is not indicated in compounds written without a hyphen: contrasentit ‘contradiction’, fisicoquímic ‘physico­
chemical’, hispanoamericà ‘Hispano­American’, rarament ‘rarely’.
When an accent (acute) and a diaeresis are both justified on the same vowel, the accent takes precedence, thus giving rise to alternations between í and ï, as in:
país
v eípaïsos
v eïnsv eïnacountry, countries
neighbouring (m.sg., m.pl., f.sg.)Both a diaeresis and an accent can occur on the same word on different vowels, as in traïció ‘treason’, aïllàvem ‘we isolated’ (imperfect), lingüística ‘linguistics’.","[633, 634, 635]"
"The foreign learner will need to appreciate that the Catalan indirect object has a range of functions far wider and more nuanced than that of the simple dative (Ens ha
parlat en francès ‘He spoke to us in French’), in order to be able to generate naturally expressions like M’han robat la cartera ‘They have stolen my wallet’ and
others as illustrated above.
A further function of the grammatical indirect object is the so­called ethic dative (a pronominal clitic referring to a person involved in or affected by a situation, see
23.1), which itself has multiple nuances.
El gos no em menja.
The dog won’t eat.
Les plantes em creixien tortes.
My plants grew twisted./The plants grew twisted, in my case.",[484]
"Page 24214
PREPOSITIONS
Prepositions in Catalan have complements which may be noun phrases (the typical case), adverbials (see 13.2), prepositional phrases (see Compound prepositions
below), non­finite verbs (see below), or clauses (see Chapter 33).
Phonologically and morphologically prepositions fall into three groups: atonic or unstressed prepositions like de, en (14.1), simple tonic prepositions (14.2), and
compound tonic prepositions (14.3). Many of the tonic prepositions are closely related in sense and usage to adverbs.","[260, 261]"
"4.2 ADJECTIVE SYNTAX AND USAGE
4.2.1 WORD ORDER
Although it can be said that the usual position of the adjective in Catalan is after the noun it modifies, the matter is rather more complex than that and is best addressed
from first principles. Adjectives in Catalan noun phrases may in fact be found before or after head nouns. The position depends in part on which kind of adjective is
involved—quantifiers and demonstratives normally precede, for example—and in part on the discourse function of the adjective in relation to the referent of the
modified noun. The typical place for a ‘restrictive’ adjective in Catalan is immediately after the head noun. The underlying principle is that this kind of adjective specifies
which X, or which kind of X, (X being the head noun or, more precisely, what it denotes). The function of such an adjective is similar to that of a restrictive relative
clause (see 31.1.2), as demonstrated in the examples below:Page 87
Visc a la casa buida.
I live in the empty house (=the house which is empty).
El cotxe és aparcat al carrer ample.
The car is parked on the wide street (=the street which is wide).
Els llibres gruixuts són mals de llegir.
Thick books (=books which are thick) are hard to read.
M’agrada molt la pintura medieval.
I am very fond of medieval painting (=painting which is medieval).
L’any següent va cobrar una herència.
The following year (=the year which followed) she inherited some money.
Coneixien un noi americà.
They knew an American boy (=a boy who was American).
If the noun has a specifying prepositional phrase complement, any descriptive adjective which agrees with the head noun follows the complement: una casa de pages
buida ‘an empty farmhouse’, màquines d’escriure antigues ‘old typewriters’. Note, however, that this arrangement is blocked if the complement is itself modified by
an adjective: ‘a long tradition of folklore activity’ is not *una tradició d’activitats folklòriques llarga but rather una llarga tradició d’activitats folklòriques.
The alternative order, adjective+noun, is appropriate when the function of the adjective is not to identify more specifically, but rather to perform one of three other
(overlapping) functions: (i) to convey some additional information, as does a non­restrictive relative clause (31.1.2), (ii) to emphasize or bring to prominence some
(already assumed) aspect of what the noun refers to, or (iii) to express the speaker’s attitude towards what is referred to. Examples:
(i) l’odiosa premsa
una mera hipòtesi
(ii) la grisa quotidianitat
la llunyana India
l’astuta guineu
(iii) el blau oceà
les altes estrelles
la seva increïble presumpció
el meu estimat col∙legathe hateful press
(=the press, which is hateful)
a mere hypothesis
(=a hypothesis, which is nothing more than a hypothesis)
(the) dull routine
distant India
the crafty fox
the blue ocean
(=the ocean, which is blue, not the blue ocean in contrast to the green one)
the lofty stars
his incredible presumption
my esteemed colleaguePage 88
What is seen in (iii) above also lies behind the characteristic adjective+noun +adjective arrangement such as els magnífics temples tailandesos ‘the magnificent Thai
temples’, la inspirada adaptació teatral de la novel∙la ‘the inspired theatrical adaptation of the novel’. In such cases (see 4.2.2) it is as though a single unit were
formed by the noun and the restrictive adjective together, with the other adjective having a descriptive/evaluative function.
An adjective may express a speaker’s attitude and at the same time identify which kind of X is referred to. In such a case, either position may be found, though on
the whole noun+adjective (the second in the following pairs) is preferred in ordinary usage.
Assagen solucions agosarades./Assagen agosarades solucions.
They are attempting bold solutions.
Va fer un discurs brillant./Va fer un brillant discurs.
She gave a brilliant speech.
Adjectives which would normally be postposed by the principles given above often precede nouns in poetry or similar registers. The effect of this inversion of the usual
order is to supply specially emphasized or emotive information:
Vénen la flota i el fibló//i del fantàstic horitzó…(J.Alcover)
There comes the fleet and the tornado, and from the fantastic horizon…
Conserva de ses branques l’eterna primavera. (M.Costa)
It retains the eternal spring of its branches.
Sol i de dol i amb vetusta gonella…(J.V.Foix)
Alone and grieving and wearing an ancient tunic…
Prenominal position of an adjective is nonetheless impossible in three cases:
(i) With attributive adjectives equivalent to a de+noun phrase complement of the head noun, of the kind la vida de família=la vida familiar ‘family life’.
equip ministerial (=equip del ministeri) *ministerial equip ministerial team
món universitari (=món de la universitat) *universitari món university world
cerimonial eclesiàstic (=cerimonial de l’església) *eclesiàstic cerimonial church ceremonial/ecclesiastical ceremonial
parc automobilístic (=parc d’automòbils) *automobilístic parc car fleet
tècniques discursives (=tècniques del discurs) *discursives tècniques discourse techniques/discursive techniques
(ii) With restrictive­specifying adjectives:Page 89He trobat una pedra groga.
*He trobat una groga pedra.
I found a yellow stone.
Fes l’examen amb un bolígraf negre.
*Fes l’examen amb un negre bolígraf.
Do the test with a black ballpoint.
No vull tractes amb gent impuntual.
*No vull tractes amb impuntual gent.
I don’t wish to deal with unpunctual people.
(iii) With an adjective that has itself a degree modifier, or a complement.
Thus while un famós cantant ‘a famous singer’ may occur in appropriate circumstances, neither *un força famós cantant nor *un famós pels seus discos
cantant is possible. It must be un cantant força famós ‘a very famous singer’, un cantant famós pels seus discos ‘a singer famous for his recordings’.
In the case of a few adjectives, position before or after the noun they modify is associated with a distinct meaning difference. In line with what we have seen above, the
preposed adjectives tend to be figurative or evaluative, the postposed ones, specifying.
grans persones
great people
la pobra família
the poor family (=which inspires pity)
un simple oficinista
a mere clerk
una trista història
a sorry tale
la pura casualitat
sheer chance
un cert interès
a certain (amount of) interest
un vell amic
an old friend (=of many years)
la mateixa idea
the same ideapersones grans
old/adult people
la família pobra
the poor (=needy) family
un oficinista simple
a simple­minded clerk
una història trista
a sad story
la casualitat pura
chance alone
un interès cert
a definite interest
un amic vell
an elderly friend
la idea mateixa
the idea itselfNotice that when standing as predicates these adjectives can only have the sense seen in the postposed modifiers: La família era pobra ‘The family wasPage 90
poor (=needy)’. The above differences in meaning are not necessarily identifiable in every case. Una gran distància ‘a great distance’ means the same as una
distància gran and, in fact, the former is more usual.
The adjectives mal and dolent ‘bad’ have essentially the same meaning; mal occurs only before a noun; dolent occurs after, and in predicate position: una mala
proposta=una proposta dolenta ‘a bad suggestion’. The adjective bo ‘good’ (bona (f.), bons (m.pl.), bones (f.pl.) irregularly has a special form bon for the
masculine singular when it precedes a noun: un bon dinar ‘a good lunch’, but un dinar bo.
Bo, dolent, petit, gran (or gros)All these very common adjectives follow the noun when they are restrictive, indicating objective quality. Preceding the noun, they usually express a subjective
evaluation.
(objective)
Va ser després que van venir els maldecaps grossos.
It was later that the big headaches came.
Porta la plata petita.
Bring the small serving dish.
(subjective)
Ens ha sortit una petita dificultat.
We’ve come across a minor difficulty.
És un gran escriptor/mentider.
He is a great writer/liar.
It is to be observed that gros is preferred to gran (both meaning ‘big’/‘large’) when what is referred to is physical volume:
Porta la plata grossa. (preferable to la plata gran)
Bring the large serving dish.
Aquestes caixes grosses no ens cabran aquí.
We won’t be able to fit those large boxes in here.","[105, 106, 107, 108, 109]"
"21.1 (PAST) PARTICIPLE: GENERAL
For the morphology of the participle see 16.5.3; there are some additional observations in 21.1.1. The (past) participle is a form of the verb which, in some of its
functions at least, is strongly adjectival. Catalan ‘past’ participles have two main functions:
(i) In combination with auxiliary haver, and more rarely tenir or ser, to form the perfect and other compound tenses. The compound tenses of all verbs are
formed with haver: the participle appears in its masculine singular form except for the particular cases mentioned in 21.1.2iv. In the less common perfect­tense
formations with tenir or ser (21.1.2ii and iii) agreement of the past participle does occur. For detailed discussion of the compound tenses in general see 17.2.
(ii) The participle may function adjectivally, in which case it will agree in number and gender like any adjective: una solució atrevida ‘a bold solution’, arguments
improvisats ‘improvised arguments’, benvolguts amics/ benvolgudes amigues ‘dear friends’, una desesperada temptativa ‘a desper­ate attempt’, and
so on. The past participle of a transitive verb is passive, that is, when used adjectivally it modifies a noun which is the direct object of the verb in question, for
example, uns temes molt debatuts ‘some much debated topics’.
As an adjective, a participle may in appropriate circumstances stand before a noun (see 4.2.1): els meus estimats amics ‘my beloved friends’, la controvertida
decisió ‘the controversial decision’, una molt arriscada (però decidida) acció ‘a very risky (but resolute) action’. Further instances of participles which may also
stand as true adjectives are:
abandonat
alarmat
allunyat
conegut
dedicat
degutabandoned/deserted
alarmed
remote
(well) known
dedicated
dueelevat
emocionat
justificat
marcat
resignat
suposatelevated
excited/moved
justified
marked
resigned
alleged/supposedPage 408
and many others. The meaning of many participles, however, ensures that they retain their verbal force so that they may not precede a noun:
una cama trencada
una reunió ajornada
papers llençats
un document imprès
una nena pentinadaa broken leg
a postponed meeting
discarded papers
a printed document
a little girl whose hair has been combedThe participial adjectives, or adjectival participles, have the property that they may appear with ser without creating a passive sentence, thus: La teva reacció era
exagerada ‘Your reaction was exaggerated’, El to era elevat ‘The tone was elevated’, La seva cara m’era desconeguda ‘Her face was unknown to me’. Note
L’orquestra era dirigida per X ‘The orchestra was conducted by X’ (passive) compared with the ungrammatical *L’orquestra era dirigida; dirigit is a non­
adjectival (verbal) participle. The participles of some verbs may either be adjectival or form part of a true passive construction: only in context is it possible to determine
whether oberta in La porta era oberta ‘The door was open(ed)’ is a descriptive adjective (‘open’) or a non­adjectival verbal participle ‘opened’. The passive voice
is discussed in detail in 29.1 while subtleties of adjectives used with the verbs ser and estar are dealt with in 30.5.
Adjectival participles may, like other adjectives, become nouns when they are introduced by an article or demonstrative: un exiliat ‘an exile’, un mort ‘a dead
body’, (aquests) impresos ‘(these) printed papers’, els afectats d’aquest afer ‘those (who are) affected by this matter’. As in the last instance, such nominalizations
often correspond to an English relative clause.
There is a considerable number of adjectives that resemble participles but which are not derived (directly) from verbs: desgraciat ‘unhappy’, indefinit ‘indefinite’,
desmesurat ‘disproportionate’, indiscriminat ‘indiscriminate’, and so on.","[426, 427]"
"The same applies when addressing relatives: Sí, papà/mamà ‘Yes, daddy/ mummy’, Que tens foc, mare? ‘Have you got a light, mother?’ Observe, however, that
the article is used when talking about relatives:
El pare arribarà aviat.
La iaia està malalta.
l’oncle Pau(Your) father will arrive soon.
Granny is ill.
Uncle Pau(c) The (generic) definite article is optional in the case of parlar ‘speak’+ the name of a language (and likewise with entendre ‘understand’, escriure ‘write’, estudiar
‘study’):
No sap parlar el rus.=No sap parlar rus.
She can’t speak Russian.
But note:
Comparat amb l’euskera el català és poc complicat.
Compared with Basque, Catalan is uncomplicated.",[73]
"Page 178
Treu­lo (el cotxe) del garatge i aparca’l a la cantonada.
Take it (the car) out of the garage and park it on the corner.
Seran uns bons col∙laboradors. Posa’ls/Inclou­los/Els hem d’incloure/Hem d’incloure’ls a la Ilista.
They’ll be good collaborators. Put them/Include them/We must include them in the list.
És una bona oportunitat: no la perdis/no l’hauries de perdre/no hauries de perdre­la.

Si arriben les meves nebodes, les acompanyaràs/acompanya­les/les pots acompanyar/pots acompanyar­les al saló.
If my nieces arrive, you will show them/show them/you can show them to the drawing room.
In all of these cases the object pronouns agree in number and in gender with the noun the speaker has in mind. Where ‘it’ refers not to an identifiable noun but to
something non­specific, to an idea or to a whole sentence (to something that might be represented by the neuter pronouns això/allò ‘that’), then ho is used, as
described in Chapter 9 (and later in 12.5).
12.3.2.2 Third­person indirect objects
Li in the singular and els (­los, ’ls) in the plural stand for both masculine and feminine indirect objects:
Ja li demostraré com s’ha de fer.
I’ll demonstrate to him/her/you how it’s to be done.
Si veus els meus pares, digue’ls/els pots dir/pots dir­los que els escriuré aviat.
If you see my parents, tell them/you can tell them I’ll write (to them) soon.
A persones com aquestes, els hem de retre/hem de retre’ls el màxim homenatge.
We must pay the highest homage to people like these.
The indirect object plural form els (­los, ’ls) is replaced in many spoken dialects (including the influential one of the Barcelona region) by an element which is
pronounced [әlzi]. This widespread variant can be explained starting from a popular reanalysis of the singular indirect object pronoun, li, as consisting of a third­person
singular element {l} (see second table in 12.1.1) followed by an indirect object element {i}. On this basis speakers have constructed [әlzi] from the third­person plural
{Is}, together with the element {i}, as in the singular. The innovation allows differentiation between third­person plural masculine direct object els and third­person
plural indirect object [әlzi]Page 179
where the standard language has only undifferentiated els. (The same tendency is detected in the substitution of the indirect object full form ­los by (non­standard) ­lis,
which is found in speech particularly in Valencia and Minorca.) In recognizing this phenomenon, and even in spontaneously reproducing it in informal conversation,
foreign learners need to be aware that it is a colloquial variant. In writing that attempts to represent popular speech, [әlzi] is generally written as els hi, as if the two
pronouns els and hi were involved (as discussed in 12.9, especially els hi considered at 12.9.3.5). The standard form of indirect object plural els (­los, ’ls) is used in
educated speech and in nearly all kinds of written texts. The following sentences show how colloquial [әlzi], reproduced according to formal orthographic convention,
would replace the correct form of indirect object els in examples already shown above:
(non­standard) Si veus els meus pares, digue’ls­hi/els hi pots dir/pots dî’ls­hi que els (hi) escriuré aviat.
(non­standard) A persones com aquestes els hi hem de retre/hem de retre’ls­hi el màxim homenatge.
12.3.2.3 Direct and indirect objects in the third person
In English, personal pronouns have the same form for direct and indirect object (‘me’, ‘him’, ‘her’, ‘them’). In Catalan, in the first and second persons, the forms for
the direct and indirect object are identical (em, etc., et, etc., ens, etc., us, etc.). Third­person masculine plural els, (­los, ’ls) serve as both direct and indirect object,
but otherwise the direct/indirect distinction is marked for the third person. This means that particular attention to appropriateness of form in relation to function must be
paid when third­person objects are involved. The general point is best illustrated by referring to use of the third­person direct object shown above in 12.3.2.1 (and
25.3) and then by reviewing the main patterns of use and details of meaning of indirect objects (see 25.4).
Generally speaking if a verb has only one object, it is a direct object:
Les odia.
She hates them (f).
La vam aguantar.
We endured it/her (f).
No el puc descriure de cap altra forma.
I can’t describe him in any other way.
As mentioned in 25.4, a few verbs which have personal subjects take only an indirect object, but no direct object, at least in the standard variety, viz. pegar ‘strike’,
telefonar ‘telephone’, trucar ‘call’, ‘ring’:Page 180
Els vaig trucar.
No li peguis.","[196, 197, 198, 199]"
"In the standard language something like parell ‘pair’ or conjunt ‘set’ is preferred in a case like the former:
Que has vist cap parell de pantalons que t’agradin?
Have you seen any pair of trousers you like?
In the second case gens de is preferred:
No tinc gens de ganes d’anar al circ.",[160]

The only cases where weak pronouns are not combined within the same clause are when they are logically the complements of different verbs, and thus not a group:
Es van atrevir a insultar­lo.
T’hauries d’afanyar a corregir­ho.","[232, 233]"
"In all these cases reflexive si can be substituted by the non­reflexive third­person stressed pronouns (ell/ella/ells/elles), again, usually reinforced with mateix. The
latter option is, in fact, generally preferred in everyday language:
Aquests dos treballen per a ells (mateixos).=Aquests dos treballen per a si (mateixos).
Those two work for themselves.
(Both reflexive: cf. non­reflexive Ja no treballo per a ells ‘I don’t work for them any more’.)
The expression fora de si ‘beside himself/herself/oneself/themselves’, however, appears not to allow ell, etc.",[183]
"31.6 OTHER ANTECEDENTS OF THE RELATIVE PRONOUNS
31.6.1 PRONOUNS AS ANTECEDENTS
As well as nouns or nominalized elements, pronouns may stand as antecedents of non­restrictive relative clauses:
M’acusen a mi, que no en sé res.
aquells, que tant de mal van ferThey’re accusing me, and I know nothing about it.
those people, who did so much harmA demonstrative or indefinite pronoun may head a relative clause introduced by unstressed que, forming a restrictive clause. In the case of the demonstratives the
meaning is ‘that/those/the one(s) who/which’:
Aquells que han fet això seran castigats.
Van interrogar a tothom que ho va veure.
Menyspreen tot allò que no entenen.",[562]
"I’ve been bitten by this dog.
Aren’t you irritated by their attitude?
She is coached by a professional.(ii) One function of the passive is to ‘thematize’ or focus attention on the object of the verbal action by situating it at the beginning of the clause (see Chapter 36,
especially 36.3–4). English word order is restricted in its possibilities to achieve this effect other than via the passive. Catalan, on the other hand, has various alternative
ways of achieving this thematization of the transitive object. The constructions described in (a)­(f) below can thus be considered as stratagems for passive avoidance
(although this notion corresponds to the perspective of the foreign learner and not to the instincts of the native speaker).
(a) The simplest of these is to keep the sentence in the active form (as in the last examples given above), with postposing of the subject as appropriate. This
construction can entail representation of the underlying object in the form of a clitic pronoun.
Vaig trucar a la porta. La va obrir un noi d’uns dotze anys.
I knocked at the door. It was opened by a boy of about twelve.
(b) The same effect can be obtained when a noun object is present. Catalan norms of word order (see 36.4) allow the object to stand first in the sentence (left
detachment), preceding the verb, in which case the object will be doubled by a redundant clitic object pronoun:
Aquests paquets, els haurem de portar demà a correus.
These parcels will have to be posted (by us) tomorrow.
Tot això, ja els ho havien explicat abans.
They had already been told all that before.
(c) The last examples in (i) above and those just given in (ii (a)) and (ii (b)) illustrate a recurrent feature which is readily converted into a guideline for good practice.
That is, simply to ‘think active’. Very many spontaneous passive constructions in English are equally as spontaneous in the Catalan active form. Again the possibilities of
verb­subject inversion in Catalan (see 36.2) facilitate matters:
Ho va descobrir un investigador belga.
It was discovered by a Belgian researcher.
Un mocador li cobria les espatlles.
Her shoulders were covered by a shawl.",[530]
"12.2.1 PRONOUN BEFORE THE VERB
The weak object pronoun stands before the verb in all cases except those mentioned below in 12.2.2, with the additional consideration covered in 12.2.3.
When the verb begins with a consonant the reinforced (A) form of the pronoun appears:
They speak to me.
She is calling you.
We invite him.
We used to know her.
She wakes up.
He was putting his tie on.
She doesn’t like them.
They recycle it.
They did not convince us.
We’ll call you early.
They sell them.
They comb their hair.
It frightened them.
We don’t have any (of them).
We spend the night there.",[191]
"Page 41.1 GENDER OF NOUNS REFERRING TO HUMANS AND FAMILIAR ANIMALS
As a very general rule nouns referring to female humans and female familiar/ domestic animals are of feminine gender (e.g. tia ‘aunt’, xinesa ‘Chinese girl/ woman’,
gallina ‘hen’), and those referring to male humans and male familiar/domestic animals are of masculine gender (e.g. oncle ‘uncle’, xilè ‘Chilean boy/man’, gall ‘cock’)
which is, of course, the source of the names masculine and feminine for the two agreement classes. There are a few exceptions, to be mentioned below (1.1.6).
Generally we find pairs of nouns, one of masculine and one of feminine gender, for the corresponding male and female referents; these pairs are morphologically
related in a number of possible ways. In the majority of cases, human males and females and males and females of familiar/domestic animals are denoted by distinct
word forms. In the case of words denoting professions that were traditionally exercised only by men, the morphologically related feminine form is used to denote ‘wife
of…’ such as alcaldessa ‘mayoress’; currently such forms are used mostly of women who exercise the profession in their own right. With professions that are even
now exclusively male (e.g. military) the former convention may survive.","[22, 23]"
"Page 17212.2 POSITION OF THE PRONOUN WITH A VERB
The form taken by an individual weak pronoun depends upon whether it precedes or follows a verb, and on whether the verb has a vowel or a consonant at the point
of contact. A weak pronoun follows an imperative, and infinitive, or a gerund, and precedes any other verb form. These forms are tabulated in the schema in 12.1.1.
We consider first those cases where the pronoun stands before the verb.","[190, 191]"
"25.2.2 SUBJECTLESS IMPERSONAL VERBS
The verbs haver and ser present particular uses in their third­person singular forms. Such constructions have no grammatical subject or, in logic, a subject which is so
indefinite as to be indeterminate.
Translating relevant tenses of ‘there is’, haver always takes the adverbial clitic hi, so that in this context the infinitive is considered to be haver­hi (see 30.1). The
words accompanying hi ha, etc., stand formally as direct object of the verb:
Hi ha tres possibilitats.
There are three possibilities.
No hi podia haver hagut cap altra manera d’aconseguir­ho.
There could not have been any other way of achieving it.
In standard Catalan this impersonal construction with haver­hi admits only the singular form (Hi ha tres possibilitats). In most dialects, however, including those of
the major cities, the tendency to make the verb agree with a plural complement is quite deeply rooted, even in educated speech (a phenomenon not dissimilar from
English ‘there’s’+plural noun, and comparably tolerable):
Hi havien molts errors, (standard Hi havia…)
There were a lot of mistakes.
Poden haver­hi circumstàncies atenuants. (standard Pot haver­hi…)
There may be attenuating circumstances.
Haver appears without hi in the archaic temporal expression temps ha ‘some time ago’, although temporal expressions meaning ‘ago’ (see 33.2.2) are usually made
with subjectless fer standing before the elapsed time referred to: fa molt de temps/tres mesos ‘a long time/three months ago’.
The principal cases for observing the impersonal use of ser are expressions like:
És aviat/tard.
Ja era de nit.",[479]
"Page 253
14.1.3.2 De+noun phrase (or infinitive) complement of adjective or quantifier
Certain adjectives take a de complement, such as in:
ple de prejudicis
curt de vistafull of prejudice
short­sightedamic de les arts
amic de discutirfond of the arts
fond of arguingPartitive complements (definite noun phrases), of numerals, quantifier adjectives, and adverbs, etc., are introduced with de:
tres de les seves companyes
pocs dels quadresthree of her comrades
few of the picturesA dislocated noun phrase (left or right), specifying something already represented by the partitive clitic en, is expressed with de (cf. 12.6v):
De llibres, en té molts, però no el que necessite.
Books, he has a lot of, but not the one I need.
En vols més, de sopa?
Do you want any more soup?
14.1.3.3 De+pronominal adjective
An important feature of Catalan grammar is the use of de+adjective in an indefinite noun phrase where the noun is understood from the context (12.6v). In many cases
this use corresponds to the English pronoun ‘one(s)’:
No tinc cigarrets americans, però si de francesos.
I haven’t got American cigarettes, but I have got French ones.
Seria preferible convertir aquesta frase tan llarga en dues de curtes.
It would be preferable to change this very long sentence into two short ones.
En este corral hi ha dos vaques teues i cinc de meues.
In this yard there are two of your cows and five of mine.
Si són necessaris més arguments, encara en tinc de més convincents.
If more arguments are necessary, I (still) have some more convincing ones.
A similar construction is found with res ‘anything’/‘nothing’:
La pel∙lícula no té res d’especial.
Si saps res de nou, m’avises.","[271, 272]"
"Note that, unlike English ‘each’, cada cannot be used pronominally. In this role cada un/cadascun is required.
cada un or cadascun ‘each (one)’, marked for gender (cada una, cadascuna):
Like its English equivalent this word has no plural form and, unless used pronominally (see 8.5), invariably introduces a noun with de ‘of’. The form cada un is more
commonly used:
He marcat amb una creu cada una (cadascuna) de les pàgines que has de copiar.
I have marked with a cross each (one) of the pages you are to copy.
Va portar regals per a cada un dels seus nebots.
She brought presents for each (one) of her nephews (and nieces).
cap ‘not one’, ‘(not) any’, invariable:
This word is a negative polarity item like gaire and gens (see below 8.4, also 26.1.5) in that it can stand alone in interrogative or conditional contexts as well as
forming a negative construction with no:
Si arriba cap visita, digue­li que s’esperi.
If any visitor arrives, tell them to wait.
Cap d’ells no ho ha entès.
Not one of them has understood.
For the difference between cap and gens see 8.6iii.
cert ‘certain’, marked for number and gender:
Used as an indefinite cert precedes the noun. In the singular it is preceded, as in English, by the indefinite article:
L’equívoc es pot atribuir a una certa tendència seva a exagerar.
The misunderstanding is attributable to a certain tendency of his to exaggerate.
Hi ha certes persones amb qui val més no tractar.
There are certain people that it is better to have nothing to do with.
Preceding the name of a specific person ‘a certain’ is translated by un tal (see below). Used absolutely or placed after the noun cert means ‘accurate’, ‘true’ or ‘sure’:Page 132
És cert que no vindran.
It’s true they’re not coming.
Estic cert del que et dic.
I’m certain about what I’m saying.
Encara no tenim notícies certes sobre aquests fets.
We still don’t have accurate news about these events.
diversos ‘several’, ‘various’ (plural), marked for gender:
Es pot fer de diverses maneres.
It can be done in various ways.
Li ho vaig haver d’explicar diverses vegades.
I had to explain it to her several times.
In the sense of ‘several’ diversos usually precedes the noun, although it may occasionally follow: problemes diversos relacionats amb el cas ‘several problems
related to the case’. In this position the meaning of ‘diverse’ comes into view, overlapping with the synonymous varis (pl. vàries):
Van provar remeis varis/diversos.
They tried various/several different remedies.
per raons vàries/diverses
for various reasons
The use of varis instead of diversos before the noun, in the sense of an indefinite number, is deemed non­standard. When ‘several’ implies a rather large number
nombrosos can be used:
Hi hagué nombroses abstencions.
There were several/a good number of abstentions.
igual (a/de) ‘(the) same (as)’:
Viu en una casa igual de/a la que vàrem visitar.
He lives in a house the same as the one we visited.
Em sembla que té un quadern igual del/al que jo vaig perdre.
I think she’s got a ring­binder the same as the one I lost.
Igual a, not igual de occurs before an indefinite or a possessive:
Aquesta planta és igual a una de tropical que em van regalar.
This plant is the same as a tropical one that I was given as a present.
Tenia un pis igual al meu.
She had a flat just like mine.
mant ‘many a’, marked for gender:Page 133
Used only in the singular, with a plural meaning, this word is confined to very formal contexts:
El text ho descriu detingudament, amb manta observació oportuna.
The text describes it in detail, with many an opportune observation.
mateix ‘same’, ‘selfsame’, marked for number and gender:
(i) Meaning ‘same’ mateix always stands before the noun or noun phrase that it qualifies:
Teníem els mateixos gustos.
We had the same tastes.
Ja no treballen amb les mateixes eines que abans.
They don’t work with the same tools as they used to.
M’ha regalat el mateix llibre que li vaig regalar jo per Nadal.
She has given me the same book as the one I gave her at Christmas.
Aquests nois no són els mateixos que varen venir a la botiga.
These boys aren’t the same ones that came to the shop.
El mateix is used pronominally to mean ‘the same (thing)’ (see 9.2):
Avui et dic el mateix que et vaig dir ahir.
I’m telling you today the same as I told you yesterday.
Sempre fas el mateix, i amb el mateix resultat.
You always do the same thing, and with the same result.
(ii) Placed either before or after a noun mateix has the emphatic meaning of ‘selfsame’, ‘very’, ‘right’ and likewise emphasizes any strong pronoun after which it is
placed, e.g. jo mateix ‘I myself’, ella mateixa ‘she herself’:
No el reconeixeria ni el seu mateix pare/el seu pare mateix.
Not even his own father himself would recognize him.
Aquestes són les seves mateixes paraules.
These are her very words.
Aquest quadre, l’he pintat jo mateix ((f.) jo mateixa).
I painted this picture myself.
Where there could be ambiguity, mateix comes after the noun if it means ‘selfsame’: la mateixa reina could translate ‘the queen herself’ or ‘the same queen’, while la
reina mateixa means only ‘the queen herself’. Mateix occurs in conventional formulations when someone is asked to identify themselves, as on the telephone –El
senyor Planes?—Jo mateix ‘Mr Planes?’ ‘Speaking’/‘That’s me’, or in an encounter—Vostè és la senyora Planells?—La mateixa ‘Are you Mrs Planells?’ ‘I
am indeed’ (lit.","[150, 151, 152]"
"20.2 INFINITIVE PHRASES AS VERBAL CONSTRUCTIONS
In the majority of uses an infinitive phrase is predominantly verbal: the infinitive may retain the verb’s usual complements, and may be modified by an adverb or
adverbial adjunct:
[Dir aquestes coses d’aquesta manera] no t’ajudarà.
Saying those things this way will not help you.
No vull [repetir­te tantes vegades la mateixa història].
I don’t want to tell you the same story over and over again.
It is important to notice that in this function the Catalan infinitive sometimes corresponds to an English gerund and sometimes to an English infinitive, depending on the
kind of relation between the infinitive and the main verb. It is equally important to observe that in Catalan it is the infinitive, not the gerund (see Chapter 22, especially
22.3.2), that functions as a verbal noun.
Infinitive phrases may display explicit marking of the passive voice, e.g Tots aquests arbres hauran de ser tallats ‘All these trees must be cut down’, though this
is not always the case (any more than it is in English): El seu comportament és dificil d’entendre ‘Their behaviour is difficult to understand’. Tense in infinitive
phrases is restricted to the marking of relative anteriority by means of the compound infinitive as in Els sabrà greu d’haver comprat el pis ‘They will regret having
bought the flat’; imperfective aspect can be marked only through the progressive periphrasis with estar+gerund: Després d’estar mirant­les una llarga estona,
finalment va decidir comprar­ne una ‘After looking at them for a long while, he finally decided to buy one’.",[412]
"In other cases, a single verb in Catalan is differentiated through pronominalization where two different verbs are used in English:
llevar
acostar
portarlift off, lift up
bring near(er)
carryllevar­s e
acostar­s e
portar­s eget up
approach
behavePage 429
More details and examples are given in 23.5.
(iii) ‘Become’:
The single English verb ‘become’ is rendered by a range of Catalan verbs, many of them pronominal: fer­se, posar­se, tornar­se, convertir­se (en),
transformar­se (en). Examples are given and translation issues discussed in 30.6.
(iv) Exclusively pronominal verbs (23.5ii), pronominal verbs that take prepositional objects (23.5 and 23.7), and verbs whose pronominal form has a specialized
meaning (23.6 and 23.9).","[447, 448]"
"3.1.1 MORPHOLOGY OF THE DEFINITE ARTICLE
Standard definite article
singular
masculine
femininebefore consonant
el
laplural
before vowel or h­
l’
l’els
lesPage 44
Use of apostrophized l’, especially as a reduction of feminine singular la, requires special comment. When followed by a vowel the singular articles, both masculine and
feminine, are reduced to l’: l’all ‘the garlic’ (m.), l’elefant ‘the elephant’ (m.), l’idiota ‘the idiot’ (m. or f.), l’ou ‘the egg’ (m.), l’ull ‘the eye’ (m.), l’ànsia ‘the
anxiety’ (f.), l’illa ’the island‘ (f.), l’olla ’the pot’ (f.).
This also applies when the vowel is preceded by h (which is silent): l’home ‘the man’ (m.), l’hora ‘the hour’ (f.), l’herba ‘the grass’ (f.). The same form l’ is also
used, as a special case, when the noun begins with s­ followed by a consonant. This is only found in words borrowed from foreign languages: l’Stradivarius ‘the
Stradivarius’, etc. (actually pronounced with an initial e­).
Exceptionally, in the standard written language, reduction of the feminine singular definite article la to l’ does not apply in the following cases:
(i) When the noun begins with an unstressed i or u (which may be preceded by h): la indústria ‘the industry’, la ullada ‘the glance’, la història ‘the story’, la
humanitat ‘humanity’, etc. (cf. l’única possibilitat ‘the only possibility’, l’hidra de la revolució ‘the hydra of revolution’, etc. where initial i/u is stressed).
(ii) When the noun is the name of a letter: la ena ‘the N’, la erra ‘the R’, la efa ‘the F’.
(iii) When the noun begins with the negative prefix a­ and its pronunciation without a pause could cause confusion with its opposite: la anormalitat ‘the
abnormality’: compare la normalitat ‘the normality’; la asimetria ‘the asymmetry’: compare la simetria ‘the symmetry’, etc.
(iv) Before the three nouns ira ‘anger’, host ‘host’, una ‘one (o’clock)’: la ira, la host, la una. (The numeral adjective una ‘one’ behaves normally: L’una era
blanca i l’altra negra ‘One of them was white and the other, black’, etc.)
Northwestern Catalan retains in the spoken language the older forms of the masculine article lo/los for el/els. Lo also appears in eastern dialects in a few fixed
expressions: per lo senyal de la Santa Creu ‘by the sign of the Cross’, tot lo dia ‘all day’, tot lo món ‘the whole world’. It also appears in folk songs.
Contraction of the definite article with prepositionsThe masculine article forms el and els placed after the prepositions a, de, and per and the word ca (=casa) are contracted with them:Page 45

The article salat refers to a special set of forms of the definite article which are most commonly used in the Balearic Islands. Its use there is typical of the spoken
language (and printed versions of folk tales and popular literature); it is not used in very formal speech.

sesThe singular articles are reduced to s’ when a noun beginning with a vowel or with h follows. The exceptions pointed out in 3.1.1 for la l’ are applied to the article
salat only when sa precedes the name of a vowel sa i ‘the i’, sa u ‘the u’.
In masculine noun phrases preceded by the preposition amb, special forms so and sos are used in Majorca, Ibiza, and Formentera: amb so martell ‘with the
hammer’, amb sos amics ‘with the friends’.
In Majorca and Minorca e s (plural) is pronounced like ets when a vowel follows; in this context ets used to be found in writing. Currently e s is the recommended
spelling, whatever the pronunciation.
Certain words in the Balearic dialects do not accept the use of the article salat. Although there is no simple rule governing this feature, it can be saidPage 46
that many of the words affected refer to objects or institutions which are unique or socially salient: el cel ‘the sky’ not *es cel, la mar ‘the sea’ not *sa mar, el rei
‘the king’, la reina ‘the queen’, el senyor (followed by a name) ‘Mr’, el doctor (followed by a name) ‘Dr’, el professor (followed by a name) ‘Professor’, el Palau
‘the Palace’, la Sala ‘the town hall’, la Cúria ‘the Curia’, el bisbe ‘the bishop’, el Papa ‘the Pope’, la Mare­de­Déu ‘the Virgin Mary’, el rosari ‘the rosary’,
l’església ‘the church’, la Seu ‘the Cathedral’, el Bon Jesús ‘the Christ child’, el dimoni ‘the devil’, l’infern ‘Hell’, el purgatori ‘Purgatory’, la parròquia ‘the
parish (church)’, els passos (floats representing scenes from the Passion of Christ carried in Holy Week processions), el sagrari ‘the taber­nacle’, el cor ‘the choir’.
When uniqueness is not foremost, the article salat appears: es papes que jo he conegut ‘the Popes I have known’, ses esglésies que ha visitat el Papa ‘the
churches that the Pope has visited’. Many cases challenge the generalization made above: es sol ‘the sun’, sa lluna ‘the moon’, es Parlament ‘the (Balearic)
Parliament’, es Govern ‘the (Balearic) Govern­ment’, es president ‘the (Balearic) president’, es àngels ‘the angels’, etc. Expressions of time require the standard
article: les nou, les deu, les onze i vint, etc. The standard article is also obligatory in prayers (en nom del Pare …‘in the name of the Father…’) and in many idioms:
com anell al dit ‘like a glove’ (lit. ‘as ring to the finger’), l’any passat ‘last year’, l’any que ve ‘next year’, including those with la preceding an adjective, mentioned
in 3.4.

(v) Que ‘as far as’, in frequently used formulae of the kind:

Que is preceded by many words (adverbs, prepositions, and others) to form compound conjunctions, introducing adverbial clauses (Chapter 33). Some common
examples are:

except that
althoughtot seguit que
d’ençà que
per més queas soon as
since (temporal)
however much(It will be noticed that some elements combining with que are themselves compounds, as is the case with tot seguit que, d’ençà que, and per més que.)
With puix ‘since’ (confined like car ‘since’ to literary usage) the use of que is optional, as it is too with com ‘as’, ‘since’ (although the compound form is prevalent
in the latter case):
Com que és tan tard, no els penso esperar.
As it’s so late I don’t intend to wait for them.","[295, 296]"
