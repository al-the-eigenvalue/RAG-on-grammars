"LW/M 2218ARMENIANThe Processual participle functions as a head of the non-finite clause of time, as in (105), or as
a constituent of Processual tense forms (which are rather rare and are not discussed here), e.g.:

‘Tomorrow in the morning he will still be walking.’LW/M 2219ARMENIANThe verbs with the thematic vowel {a} are used to derive passive forms from the Aorist stem on {c}.
The suffix {v} is placed after aorist stem marker {c} (which is homonymous with the causative
derivator), and the thematic vowel in passive forms is always {e}:klini
AUXActiveThe Future participle fimctions as an attribute with a potential meaning (in this case it may be also
treated as a Dative case form of the Infinitive), e.g. (22,23) or as a constituent of future tenses of the

the patient that is expressed by the noun in the nominative and usually represents the theme of the
utterance. The agent is eliminated or expressed by an agentive phrase.","[9, 10]"
"LW/M 229ARMENIANNouns with specific reference (proper nouns included) in NOM and DAT are usually marked by
DEF, e.g. (1), (3). Proper nouns function without DEF in the position of vocative, see (52), or of
the complement of the nomination verb, as in:
(3) Anun-9
drin
Petros
Name-DEF put:AOR:3PL Petros
'<He> was named Petros.’
DEF is obligatorily used if a noun has a determiner of the following types: (a) appositive proper
name, e.g. Erevan k’ayak’-a
‘the city of Erevan’; (b) adnominative attribute, e.g.: hor girk’-a2.1. Nouns‘father’s book’; see also (27); (c) adjective in superlative degree, e.g.: amenaxelok’ mard-a ‘the
wisest man’, (d) ordinal numeral: erkrord girk’-a ‘the second book’, (e) demonstrative and personal
pronoun in GEN, e.g.: im girk’-a ‘my book’, as in (49, 55, 57).
The noun in NOM without DEF refers to a non-specific object, as in (19, 20, 92).
Mass nouns used with DEF denote the substance as a whole, whereas the same word without
article refers to a part of the substance, cf.:Nouns have Number: SG (unmarked) and PL (marked agglutinatively by the suffix {er/ner},
postpositive Definite article {o/n}or postpositive Possessive article: {s} for the 1* person, {d} for the
2"" person, prépositive Indefinite quasiarticle mi ‘one’, and five case forms (NOM, DAT, ABL,(4) T’anak’ tap’vec

2.1.1. Number
Noun in SG refers to a single object, as in (1), or to a general concept, see (28). This form may be
used in a noun phrase comprising a numeral: erek’ usanoy {three student-SG} ‘three students’, see
also (13, 27, 30, 80). All nouns have PL forms which denote that more than one specific object is
indicated, e.g. (25, 80). This form may also convey a generic meaning, e.g. (29, 36). Mass nouns in
PL denote different specific kinds of substances: gini-ner ‘wines’, yuy-er ‘oils’.",[5]
"Personal and emphatic pronouns show the same number distinctions as do the nouns; the gender
is not marked, see Table 9 (on the next page). The 2 Person PL pronoun may be used with a
singular reference in the formal style (a verb agreeing with this 2"" Person form must be plural), see(71, 72).
Pronoun-noun construction is possible in MEA

theteachers’,duk’usucicner-d‘you,theDemonstrative pronouns are subdivided in three classes according to the spatial and/or temporal
remoteness from the speaker (pronouns containing element {s}, indicate more proximate objects).
The base and derivative pronouns are distinguished, see Table 11 (on the next page).
Pronouns sa, da are declined like the personal pronoun na (see Table 9). Pronouns ays, ayd, ayn
usually modify the noun phrase which is obligatorily marked DEF in the argument position, as in (52,
57, 63, 101, 108, 110, 154) except some nouns in PL ending in {-ik},e.g. mard-ik people’, or {-k’ },
as in : angliaci-k’ ‘the English.’ If the noun determined by a demonstrative pronoun occurs in the
function of an adnominal attribute, as in (118), or an adverbial modifier, see (148), it has no DEF.",[7]
"I:DAT tell: AOR:3SG‘Someone has told me....’
Possessive articles denote relation with the 1* {-s} or the 2"" Person SG {-d}: girk’-s ‘my book’,
girk’-d ‘your book.’. Combined with RES.PART or with INF, the possessive article refers to the
agent: gr-ac-s (write-RES.PART-D1) ‘<the thing> I have written’, gn-al-d (departure-INF-D2)
‘your departure.’ For more information about article see Tumanjan (1963).
2.1.3. CaseNOM has zero ending (and is therefore unmarked in the morpheme string); DAT ends in {-i},
{-u}, {-an}, {-a}, {-o}, {-oj}, {-va}, or {-c}, depending on the type of declension (most nouns and
other declinable parts of speech are declined according to the 1* type on {-i}; for all declension
types, ABL ends in {-ic}, INST ends in {-ov}, LOC ends in {-um}. It is characteristic for MEA that
while DAT in function of the adnominal attribute cannot be modified by DEF, DAT governed by a
verb or an adjective often has DEF.
NOM may function as (a) a subject of the sentence, (b) a direct object denoting non-person, as
in (1, 19, 20, etc); (c) an adverbial modifier of location, see (39, 64), (d) of time, as in (44, 120), (e)
a complement ofthe copula, as in (7, 35, 116, 117), or (f) a vocative, e.g. (60,61).
DAT may be subordinate (i) to a noun and function as an attribute conveying different relations,
such as (a) possessive, e.g. (46), (b) subjective, as in ( 61), (c) objective, e.g. (86), (d) of origin, as
in (104), (e) part of a whole, e.g. (43, 110, 143, 152), etc.; (ii) to a verb or an adjective and functions
as: (a) a direct object denoting a person, as in (51, 55, 63), (b) a complement of addressee or
beneficient, e.g. (118, 131, 149), (c) an adverbial modifier of location, e.g. (4, 43), (d) an adverbial
modifier of time, as in (107), etc.
ABL may represent (a) complement of verbs of negative emotion, removal, e.g. (83, 87, 122);(b) partitive object (with mass nouns), as in (161); (c) agent’s complement in passive construction,
see (25); (d) complement denoting the basis of comparison, e.g. (10); (e) adverbial modifier of
cause, as in (4); (f) adverbial modifier of location (point of departure), as in (30, 47, 157), (g)
adverbial modifier of time (moment of beginning), e.g. (128).
INST is used as: (a) complement of the verbs of contact, e.g. (26, 84), filling, e.g. (82),
occupation, e.g. (144) , (b) complement of instrument, see (43), (c) complement of concommitant
object, as in (24, 40, 61), (d) agent’s complement in passive construction (27, 29), (e) adverbial
modifier of manner, as in (90, 134), route, see (111, 112), time, e.g. (81), cause, as in (156).
Noun in INST may also be subordinated to another noun and function as a premodifier qualifying
a thing or a person by its integral part, e.g. Snorhk’-ov kin {talent-INST woman} ‘talented woman’,
ms-ov karkandak (meat-INST pie) ‘meat pie.’
LOC refers to the second valency of verbs of residence; in constructions with other verbs this
case form functions as an adverbial modifier of place, see (55, 59, 130, 142, 143) or of location in
time, as in (137).",[6]
"LW/M 2211ARMENIAN(10) sar-ic

‘higher than a mountain.’
Forms of the superlative degree are constructed in two ways: (1) with the word amen
‘all’ that
functions (a) as a constituent of the complex form, e.g. from the adjective barjr ‘high’ the form
amena-barjr ‘the highest’ may be derived, or b) as a separate word in ABL: amenic barjr ‘the
highest’; 2) with the suffix {aguyn}: barjr-aguyn ‘the highest’, meg ‘great? — mec-aguyn ‘the
greatest’, e.g. (168).
Adjectives used as attributes in the noun phrase, as in (28, 43), or as complements of a
copulative predicate, e.g. (141, 145, 169) are uninflected. Nominalized adjectives have DEF or
possessive article and are declined in SG and PL, see Table 7:

=Cardinals are usually determinants denoting the exact amount of objects, e.g. (30, 52, 80). In this
case they are not declined. If the count of objects is inexact, the particle mi ‘a’ is placed before the
numeral, e.g. (165).",[6]
"LW/M 228ARMENIAN2. GRAMMAR
The word order in Armenian is relatively free (nonrigid S-O-V).
The subject is usually placed before the predicate, the complements and adverbial modifiers may
occur before or after the predicate, depending on the functional sentence perspective (see Comrie
1984 for more details). In the noun phrase, the attribute always precedes the noun. Other syntactic
elements of the non-finite clause, such as the agent of participial action expressed by a noun in DAT,
a pronoun in GEN, or an adverbial, precede the non-finite form, as in: im gr-ac namak-a {I:GEN
write-RES.PART letter-DEF} ‘the letter I have written’, see also (86).
MEA has the following parts of speech: nouns, adjectives, verbs, pronouns, numerals, adverbs,
prepositions, postpositions, conjunctions, modal words, and interjections (the latter two classes will
not be discussed here). The present sketch deals mainly with the verbal forms and their syntactic
properties.","[4, 5]"

‘[All] ink spilled on the table because of your carelessness.’
Nouns denoting places are used without articles if they are in the position of the locative adverbial,
as in (39, 64).
Generic nouns functioning as subjects are usually marked by DEF:
(6) Bzisk-9petk’;Doctor-DEF must;2© uSadir — lin-i

2.1.2. Article
In the position of copula’s complement, nouns are used without articles, as in (7), see also (93).
Definite article {o/n} is used mostly with nouns in NOM or DAT. Variant {9} is used in words
ending in consonant, e.g. tun-a ‘house-DEF’; {n} is found in nouns ending in vowel, e.g.: erexa-n
‘child-DEF.’ Variant {n} is also used after a consonant and pronounced jointly with the first vowel
of the next word, provided the latter is one of the following: (a) an auxiliary verb that is enclitical
and marks the focused word (the most important piece of information in the sentence), e.g. (1), or
(b) a word beginning with a vowel and bearing the phrasal stress, e.g. (2):

similar objects, e.g. (8) , or (b) a weakly definite object, i.e. one represented by the speaker as known
to him but not to the hearer (in this use the indefinite quasiarticle is synonymous with the pronoun

"2.6. Prepositions, postpositions, and conjunctions
2.7.1. Non-finite forms
In MEA, postpositions prevail over prepositions. Semantically they are classified into groups
referring to location, time, accompaniment, exception, cause, reference, purpose, manner, measure,
support, oppositon, etc. Postpositions and prepositions govern noun forms of different cases, see
Table 13.
There is a small group of words that may function both as prepositions and postpositions: baci
(ABL) ‘except’, snorhiv (DAT) ‘thanks to’, ankax (ABL) ‘independent of, hamajayn (DAT) ‘in
accordance with’, sksa¢g (ABL) ‘from’, hakarak (DAT) ‘in contradiction with’, handerj (INST)
‘with’, ‘in spite of.”

| aranc ‘without’, hanun ‘or the sake of, etc.",[9]
"2.7.2. Voice
2.7.2.1. FormationDepending on the valency, finite and non-finite forms may have the grammatical category of voice.
The category of voice is constituted by the opposition of active and passive forms. Passive forms
may be derived from bi- and trivalent verbs that combine with the direct object (i.e. with the
complement that may be expressed either by the noun in NOM, if it refers to a non-person, or by the
noun in DAT referring to a person). There are some exceptions from this rule: verbs unenal ‘have’,
gitenal ‘know’, and zyjal ‘regret’, etc. are not used in passive form.
Passive forms are regularly derived with the suffix {v}. If the infinitive ends in {el}, the passive
form is derived from the stem of the Infinitive (Present stem). In passive forms of the causative verbs
suffix {v} replaces element {n} of the causative morfeme {ecn/acn}:In passive constructions, the agentive phrase is usually eliminated. The agentive phrase may be
represented by the noun in DAT with the postposition xoymic ‘from the side of or by the noun in
ABL or INST. The choice between the case forms depends on the relation of the noun to the
category human/non-human and on the semantics of the verb.
If the agent is human, the agentive phrase may be always represented by the postpositional
phrase, irrespective of the semantics of the verb, e.g.:
(24) Lur-o

If the verb denotes emotional or mental activity (sirel ‘love’, atel ‘hate’, nerel ‘excuse’, anicel
‘damn’, arhamarhel ‘despise’, etc.), the agent may be expressed by the noun in ABL, as in:

"2.2. Adjectives
Adjectives are of two kinds: (1) qualitatives that have forms of comparative and superlative degrees,
and (2) relatives that have no such forms. The form of comparative degree is analytical and consists
of the adjective with the adverb aveli ‘more’, as in (10) , see also (86):Cardinals may be used alone (pronominally) for the nomination of abstract numbers; in that case
they are declined. Declension of the numerals is presented in Table 8 on the next page.
Numerals in PL denote school marks or objects with corresponding numbers, i.e. plurality is
attributed to the denotation, not to the amount expressed by the numeral. Cardinals in INST (usually
not greater than fasn ‘ten’) are used as complements of copula, as in (11), or as adverbial modifiers,
as in (12), in utterances referring to an action that is performed jointly:LW/M 2212(11)Menk’ erek’-ov

"2.5. Adverbs
Some adverbs often coincide with qualitative adjectives formally and are differentiated only by the
syntactic position, e.g. Jav ‘well’, vat ‘bad’, barjr ‘high’, goh ‘satisfied’, geyecik ‘beautiful’, hmut
‘able’, xizax ‘brave’, hpart ‘proud’, azat ‘free’, Jayn ‘wide’, etc. There are also special adverbializing
suffixes: {-abar}, e.g. barekam-abar ‘in a friendly manner; {oren}, e.g. xoramank-oren ‘slyly’;
{apes}, e.g. gerazanc-apes ‘excellently’, {-ovin} kam-ovin ‘voluntarily.’ Some adverbs are petrified
forms of different cases, e.g. vayuc {early-ABL} ‘long ago’, hn-um {old-LOC} ‘in olden times’, or
of other grammatical forms; e.g. hamarya derives from the Imperative of Old Armenian hamarim
‘consider’; durs ‘out’ represents Old Armenian noun durn ‘door’ in ACC:PL, etc.
Semantically, adverbs belong to the following types: (1) temporal, (2) locative, (3) of manner,
(4) of measure. The most important for the present sketch are temporal adverbs, which are divided in
several groups: (a) deictic, denoting time span related to the moment of speech: avaj ‘before’, ayZmLW/M 2216ARMENIAN‘now’, hima ‘now’, nerkayums ‘at present’, verjers ‘lately’, hetagayum ‘“n the future, Sutov ‘soon’,
heto ‘after’, ‘next time’, etc.; (b) adverbs of the initial and final points of the action: vayuc ‘since the
old times’, mankuc ‘since childhood’, arajuc ‘before’, ayZmvanic ‘from the present time’, etc; (c)
parts of the day: aravotyan ‘in the moming’, erekoyan ‘in the evening’, giserov ‘at night’, cerekov ‘in
the daytime’ etc., (d) adverbs of durativity and iterativity, see below 2.7.4.3.1.","[8, 9]"
"In certain passive constructions the subject position is not substituted by the noun in NOM. The
agentive phrase is possible in principle, but it is not used because of awkwardness. Usually the agent
is non-specific. If the predicate is represented by the causative verbs (argelel ‘forbid’, xorhurd tal
‘advise’, t’uyl tal ‘permit’, etc.) or by the verbs of intention (orosel ‘decide’, cragrel ‘plan’ etc.), the
Infintive functions as the subject, e.g.:

construction (without the subject). Their second oblique object, expressed by the noun phrase with
the postposition masin ‘about’, is retained in the same form in the passive construction:Special attention must be paid to a rather rare construction with a passive diathesis, cf. (Xolodovit
1974) where the agent cannot be expressed. In this case, the predicate is represented by the
Resultative form of the transitive verb without the passive suffix {v}, as in:(31)ARMENIANSubjectless sentences are of three kinds:

The non-countable predicates refer to situations that are lasting without change and are unbounded
by any specific intervals. They cannot express habitual meaning (if the agent is specific, they are
incompatible with adverbials of iteration).
Armenian non-countable verbs are revealed with regard to the meaning of the Imperfective forms
(Present or Imperfect). The verb is considered to be non-countable if it is impossible to insert an
iterativity adverbial into the sentence with the Present or Imperfect form of the verb. Non-countable
verbs denote the following situations (it may be supposed that these groups are universal):
(1) intrinsic properties of things (weight, size, orientation): tanel ‘hold’, ksrel ‘weigh’, arzenal cost’,
ete.;
(2) relations: ent’argvel ‘be subordinate’, verabervel ‘treat’, hamapatasxanel ‘correspond’, etc.;
(3) skills, knowledge: gitenal ‘know’, karcel ‘believe’, hamarel ‘consider’, ent’adrel ‘presuppose’
etc.52.7.4. Indicative mood
The Indicative mood conveys the action presented as real in the present, past or future. These
temporal distinctions are expressed by tense-aspect forms. Before analyzing the use of tense-aspect
forms, aspectual subclasses of Armenian verbs should be discussed.","[11, 12]"

"LW/M 22252.7.4.3. Actional Tense-Aspect
2.7.4.3.1. PresentARMENIANFormsThe situation referred to by the utterance may (1) or may not (2) be related to a specific (definite or
indefinite) point or interval on the time axis. In case (1), the situation is regarded as temporally
localized, in case (2), as non-localized, i.e. not anchored at a unique point or interval on the time axis
(Koschmieder 1987, Bondarko 1987, Kozintseva 1991). In utterances referring to a temporally
localized situation, the Present denotes an action attached to the point of speech that is in progress

The Present may express different types of situations that are not localized in time: (a) iterative
action or (b) ability of the agent to perform the action.
The iterative meaning is rendered by utterances comprising adverbial modifiers with the following

The meanings of person, number and tense (taxis) are expressed by the main verb in the Subjunctive
mood. These combinations should be regarded as analytical forms because it is almost impossible to
use the particle piti without them. The predicative petk’ é in these combinations, despite its
impersonal inner form, is compatible with the subject in the Nominative (i.e. the combination “petk’ @
+ Subjunctive” functions as a finite form), as in (144).

overview of the phonemic system and the typology ofThe Lexical Tonology of Kinandethe phonological rules, which
Souletin dialect, is given. TwoNGESSIMO M. MUTAKA
University of Yaounde
This work discusses the lexical tonology of Kinande, a
Bantu language spoken in Eastern Zaire, by focusing on
the structure of the verb and the nominal form. The main
claim is that a stratally organized phonology model is
better equipped to deal successfully with the tonal
behavior of the Kinande data. More specifically, it is
argued that Kinande phonology consists of two lexical
strata, P1 and P2. Although P1 is a postlexical stratum,
it nevertheless exhibits some lexical properties. It is also
arguedthatthestemundergoesrulesof stratumonewhile the Infl formative, that is, the Subject Marker and
the Tense markers in the verb form, participate in
stratum two rules. At the same time, it is shown that,
althoughthestemisformedatstratumome,thetonological system of Kinande makes a clear distinction
between constituents of the stem like the Extensions and
the constitutents of the VerbFinal, i.e. the prefinal+the Final Vowel that are selected by certain tenses to be
part of the stem. It is also argued that the Object Marker
(OM), whose position is between the Infl formatives andthe stem, is also derived at stratum one.
Thedifferentstrataarearguedtoconstituteindependent blocks with their own properties. Stratum
one is for example claimed to be cyclical and to
correspond to rules which apply at the stem level.
Stratum two is claimed to correspond to the word level
rules. In the verb complex form, it is argued that, at
stratum two, Infl is interpreted as a phonological word
and that the macrostem(i.e. stem+OM)and the stemare preceived as phonological domains for tonological
tules. This statum two is also claimed to be the place
where the idiosyncracies about tenses are encoded.","[30, 31]"

2.7.4.4. Resultative Tense-Aspect forms
Analytical forms comprising the resultative participle may be structurally and semantically divided
into three groups: 1) forms of Resultative proper, derived mainly from intransitive and passive verbs
with the help of the auxiliary verb forms em ‘be:1SG:PRS’, éi ‘be:1SG:PAST’, etc; 2) Secondary
Resultative forms derived from transitive verbs with the auxiliary verb /inel ‘be’, ‘be repeatedly’; 3)
forms of Experiential Resultative with the auxiliary ka ‘is’, ‘exists.’2.7.4.4.1. Resultative proper (Present and Imperfect Resultative of intransitive and passive
verbs)
The basic meaning of the Resultative proper is that of a state which results from a previous action
(Abeyyan 1974). In Armenian, there are two diathesis types of the Resultative (Kozintseva 1988),
namely 1) subjective, derived from intransitive verbs, like (67), and certain transitive verbs of
perception with a generalized object, (68); 2) objective, derived from transitive verbs with the
passive suffix {v}, as in (69), or without it, e.g. (70), the latter construction being rare and
impossible to use with the agentive phrase (see also 2.2.2):

"2.7.8.3. Passive form of the Imperative
2.7.8.2. Subject in the Imperative construction
The subject (1st or 2nd Person) is seldom present in the Imperative sentence, because the agent of
the action is obvious from the communication. Still it may be represented by the pronouns of the 2nd
Person: du ‘you (SG)’, duk’ ‘you (PL)’ or by emphatic pronoun combined with possessive article of
the 2nd Person: ink’-d ‘yourself (SG)’, ink’ner-d ‘yourself (PL).’ If the agent is generalized, it may
be denoted by the determinative pronoun with D2: bolor-d ‘all of you’, amenk’-d ‘all of you’, etc.
If the agent is the 3rd Person, it is usually named by the subject. The predicate is represented by t’oyconstruction. This form conveys the prescription addressed to a person or persons that are not
participants of the communication.
The subject (2nd Person) is usually present in the Imperative sentence, if it conveys a request, or
a softened order:
(160)Du inj ner-ir,
Aslan (S.X.)
You me forgive-IMP:2SG, Aslan

Note. Phonematic interpretation of affricates differs from their real pronunciation: phonemes /c/ and
/&/ are voiceless with glottalic articulation and tense, whereas /c/ and /&/ are simply voiceless and
lax.
The stressed vowel is characterized mainly by greater loudness and, to some extent, by higher
pitch and greater length. The stress usually falls on the last syllable of the word. There are a few
exceptions: (1) if the last syllable contains the definite article {9}, the stressed syllable (stressed
vowels are marked by caps) is the preceding one, e.g. /aSOte/ ‘Ashot:DEF’; (2) in compound verbs
consisting of two phonetic parts, the first word is stressed /pAr gal/ ‘dance’; (3) enclitical auxiliary
verb forms, proclitical monosyllabic prepositions i ‘for’, ond ‘with’, ast ‘according’, the word mi
referring to the indefinite pronoun ‘one’ or to the imperative particle ‘just’, are unstressed.
Non-automatic phonemic alternations are related to the change of the stress. In derivative and
word formation processes, the vowels /i/ and /u/ are changed to /9/ or deleted in the unstressed
position, e.g.: /sIrt/ ‘heart’ - /sor-tI/ ‘heart:DAT’, /tUn/ ‘home’ - to-na-yIn ‘of home’, /u-sUm/
‘learning’ - /us-mAn/ ‘learning:DAT’, etc.",[4]
"The Souletin Verbal Complex
New Approaches to Basque Morphophonology
ULRICH J. LUDERS
The study presents an analysis of the Souletin verbal
complex. Souletin is one of the seven main dialects of
Basque. It is spoken by about 11,000 people in SW
France. Basque and its dialects are known for their

to three participants, the tripartite graded honorific
system, the great number of non-fact constructions and

here consists of a semantic, a morphophonemic and a

thetypology of these P-rules: prosody (e.g., the i-harmony

discussed (actant markers; marker of semantic function;plural markers; roots of auxiliaries and synthetic verbs;
causative, assertative and negative marker; tense marker;aspect marker; non-fact markers; subordinators). Two
main conditions are responsible for a split of the verbal
paradigm into two different systems of organisation: the
semantic function of the actants and their speech-act

"2.7.4.1, Aspectual classification of MEA verbs
In MEA, the aspectual verb derivation is not productive. Among the Aktionsarten, only the
multiplicative and distributive verbs are known. They are derived by suffixation and/or reduplication.
Multiplicative verbs derive mainly from the intransitive verbs denoting transition and
onomatopoeia. There are three main multiplicity suffix forms, {-at-}, {-ot-}, {-t-}, and several
others (Abrahamyan et al. 1974). In MEA suffixed verbs are not numerous; in fiction texts they are
rare (Abrahamyan 1962). The situation is different with dialects where suffixation is more productive
(there are more than 700 derived verbs (Hakobyan 1972)). The semantic correlation between initial
and derived forms is usually described as the opposition of semelfactive and multiplicative actions:
dxk-al ‘hit with a thud’—> dxk-dk-al ‘hit repeatedly with a thud.’
Apart from suffixes and the reduplication, multiplicative verbs included in this group can also
contain complex prefixes consisting of semantically opposed pairs (analytical verbs) or complex of
semantically opposed roots, for instance: des u den gnal ‘walk to and fro’; et u araj anel ‘walk to
and fro’; ners u durs anel ‘come in and go out? (lit.’in-and-out do’); e/-u-mut anel ‘come in and go
out’; gnal gal ‘walk to and fro’ (lit. ‘go and come); tanel berel ‘carry to and fro’ (lit. take away and
bring back).
Distributive verbs are derived mainly by means of multiplicity suffixes mentioned above.
Reduplicated forms are rare; in some few cases they may also contain one of the suffixes expressing
multiplicity. Semantically, reduplicated and suffixed distributive verbs are considered to be the same,
cf; Hakobyan1975, e.g.: cak-el ‘make a hole’ cak-ck-el ‘make several holes’ ¢ak-ck-ot-el ‘makeseveral holes,’
The classification given below is based on the latent aspectual meanings which are manifested as
differences in the functioning of tense-aspect verb forms.
The opposition of countable / non-countable actions belongs to the highest level of the aspectual
classification. The subdivision of the predicates into countable and non-countable (Bulygina 1982) is
based on different ways of relating the situation to the time axis. The countable predicates refer to(4) residence: aprel ‘live’, bnakvel ‘reside’, etc.;
(5) possession: unenal ‘have’, parunakel ‘contain’, tirapetel ‘own’, etc.;
(6) occupation: yekavarel ‘direct’, asxatel ‘work’, usuccut’yun anel ‘teach’, etc.
There exists a small group of uncountable verbs whose Present and Imperfect have countable
counterparts: uni ‘has’, unenum é ‘has repeatedly’; arze ‘costs’, arzenum é ‘costs repeatedly.’ These
additional forms of the Present and Imperfect tenses are relics of the Subjunctive Present and Past of
Old Armenian; for more information see (Abeyyan 1974: 251).
Countable verbal lexemes are subdivided into terminative and aterminative. Non-countable verbs
are inherently aterminative.
Terminative verbs are subdivided into verbs of achievement and verbs of accomplishment,
depending on whether there is a process leading to the terminal point of action (Vendler 1967).
Accomplishments imply that the terminal point is achieved as a result of a process which has some
duration, e.g.: karucel ‘build’,norogel ‘repair’, /ucel ‘solve’ etc.",[12]

"Verbs of achievement denote actions which do not imply a process leading to the terminal point;
their beginning and end, if at all present, are merged, e.g.: linel ‘be repeatedly’, patahel ‘occur’,
katarvel ‘happen’, handipel ‘meet’, tesnvel ‘see each other’, etc.
Aterminative verbs refer to situations that do not imply a state predicted by the action,
(Xolodovit 1963). Aterminative verbs may be countable, as: zbosnel ‘walk’, tnk’al ‘groan’, and noncountable, as: karcel ‘mean’, atel ‘hate’, etc.
Aterminative verbs are further subdivided into static and dynamic. Dynamic aterminative verbs
denote homogeneous processes including participants that play a relatively active role (dynamic
activities may be said to take place), cf. xosel ‘speak’, t’ert’el ‘leaf’, sncel ‘breathe’, etc. Static verbs
do not usually admit adverbs referring to an intensity with which the participants are involved or the
way in which the event is proceeding (van Voorst 1992). States exist or persist for an indefinite
period of time, their features are homogeneity and lack of change, limits, or agency (Brinton 1987).
Armenian static verbs may be subdivided into the following groups: (a) verbs of state, e.g., ginvel ‘be
located’, ereval ‘be seen’ etc., (b) modals, e.g.: kamenal ‘desire’, uzenal ‘wish’, karoyanal ‘be able’,
etc. (c) verbs of relation, e.g.: nSanakel ‘denote’, tarbervel ‘differ’, etc.
2.7.4.2. Actional and Resultative forms
Indicative forms are divided into Actional and Resultative. Actional tense-aspect forms of the
Indicative except the Aorist are analytical and consist of the Imperfective, ending in {-um}, Perfect,
ending in {-el} or Future participle, ending in {-u}, and the auxiliary verb forms (see Tables 15-17
on the next page). In the sentence, the auxiliary verb is placed after the rhematic word.",[12]

"‘That return must have occurred in 441 or 442 AD.’2.7.8.1. Imperative paradigm
2.7.7.2. Past and Past ResultativeIf the reference point (narrative time) coincides with the moment of speech, the Past Obligative
denotes an action that had to be realized in the past, as in:
i

This before OBL say-2SG:PAST, - laugh: AOR:3 SG Taguhi-DEF
“""You should have said that before,"" said Taguhi laughing.’(S.X.)The Imperative paradigm is usually described as comprising two forms: (a) 2SG: gna ‘go!’, and (b)
2PL: gnacek’ ‘go!’ Only these forms are negated by the special particle mi: mi gna ‘don’t go!’, mi
gnacek’ ‘don’t go!’.
If the Imperative paradigm is constituted on the functional principle, ie. if the prescriptive
function is taken as the basis, as suggested in (Xrakovskij, Volodin 1986), the deficiency of personal
forms of the traditional paradigm is made up in Armenian with the forms of the Future Subjunctive
and t’oy-construction. The t’oy-construction represents the Imperative analytical forms consisting ofLW/M 2250ARMENIAthe particle r’oy ‘let’ and the 3SG or 3PL of Future Subjunctive: t’oy gna ‘let him go’, t’oy gnan ‘let
them go.’ The element t’oy (originally the 2SG Imperative form of the verb t’oynel ‘let’, ‘allow’) is
regarded as a particle because it has lost both the lexical and grammatical meaning of the 2nd Person
Singular Imperative. Sentences with this form do not always convey the idea of permission; besides,
they do not necessarily imply that the hearer is the transmitter of the prescription.
Negative form of the 2nd Person of the Imperative is constructed with the help of the stressed
particle mi ‘not.’ By the majority of verbs, this negative particle is added to the positive form: mi
kangnir ‘don’t get up’, mi gna ‘don’t go.’ However, the negative Imperative forms of verbs of some
morphological types do not coincide with the positive ones (are formed from different stems), cf:
barjranal ‘tise’ > barjracir ‘tise!’ > mi barjrana ‘don’t rise’, kardal ‘read’—> kardacek’ ‘read’
—> mi kardak’ ‘don’t read.”
In the colloquial speech, the shorter forms are preferred whose last consonant /r/ is truncated:
(mi) gri (don’t) write’ instead of (mi) grir. The Negative Imperative forms of the 1st and 3rd
Person Singular and Plural comprise the negative prefix {t}:
(ari) ¢-gnam ‘(let me) not go’,
(ek/ekek’) &-gnank’ ‘(let us) not go” (see Table 22 for the full paradigm of the Imperative forms).

The history of Armenian is divided into three stages: Old Armenian, or Grabar (5th-11th centuries
AD), Middle Armenian (11th-17th centuries), and Modern Armenian, or Ashkharhabar (since the
17th century). Modern Armenian is represented in two standard variants, Western and Eastern. The
Eastern Armenian dialects of the {um} branch (especially the Ararat dialect), and the Westem
Armenian dialects of the {ko} branch (especially the Constantinopolis dialect) formed the basis of
the Eastern and Western variants of Modern Armenian, respectively. This subdivision is made only
with respect to the formation of the present tense. A detailed classification of Armenian dialects
based on a larger number of characteristics is given by Garibyan (1953), Jahukyan (1978).
Wester Armenian was distributed in Turkish Armenia, but at present it is used by most
Armenians world over. The Standard Modern Eastern Armenian (MEA) separated from the New
Armenian in mid-19"" century. MEA is spoken by approximately 2,725 thousand people (as of 1985
(Bromlej, 1988) in the Republic of Armenia and other parts of the former Soviet Union, as well as in
Iran and in India.
After the establishment of the Soviet regime, MEA acquired the status of the official standard
language that functions in all spheres of public life. An extensive scientific terminology is created,
many lexical innovations are borrowed from Russian, the syntactic structure is undergoing further
evolution, postpositions and prepositions assume new meanings. The orthographic reform has
resulted in a more stable orthography and a closer relationship between pronunciation and spelling.
Armenian is rich in features which from the typological viewpoint are interesting for the
descriptive and general linguist, as noted by Connoly (1970) in his short review on synchronic
Armenian bibliography. The scientific description of MEA was initiated in 19th century by Stephanos
Palasanyan. Highly important theoretical grammars including phonetics, morphology and syntax
belong to Hiatya Atatyan (1952-67), Manuk Abeyyan (1974), and Gevork Jahukyan (1974). In the
1970s, a three-volume description of MEA appeared: Abrahamyan et al. (1974, 1976); Atak’elyan et
al. (1979). A number of special monographs addressing various aspects of the structure of MEA
were published after 1970, including Parnasyan (1970, 1986), Xatatrjan and Ajrapetjan (1971),
Asatryan (1970-77), Abrahamyan (1981), Minassian (1980), Sakayan (1986), etc.
The present sketch comprises a general introductory information on MEA phonetics and
grammar. Verb forms and constructions are discussed in more detail. The sketch is supplemented
with an original MEA text and a bibliography listing the most essential publications on MEA.","[1, 2, 3]"

2.7.5.1.1. Simple Sentences
In simple sentence, Future Subjunctive may convey the meaning of optative, imperative, intentional,
hypothetical or experiential action.
Optative meaning is defined here as a wish or desire of the speaker with regard to a situation
performed by a specific agent (including the speaker himself). The modal frame of the optative
utterance may be presented as follows: ‘I declare that I consider it desirable...’ (Barnetova et
al.1979, V.2: 815), hence the optative meaning may be regarded as a separate type of the
communicative function at the level of statements, commands, and questions (Belitova-Krzizkova
1984; Kordi 1990, a.o.). Grammatically, the optative meaning is rendered
by constructions with
Subjunctive which refer to the action desired by the speaker. The Future Subjunctive denotes the
action that is possible to perform in the future from the speaker’s point of view (94), or indirect
request, cf. (95).

"Infinitive is the form of the head-word of the verb in dictionary entries. This form functions as a
complement of phasal, e.g. (46), modal, as in (7, 60, 116, 169), and causative verbs, cf. (31, 42, 55,
88, 140). It may be used as a predicate in the imperative sentence.| mek ‘all over’, handerj ‘with’, ‘inspite of’, etc.",[9]
"The Future Indicative denotes a planned action which is expected or intended by the agent, as in:
(64) Vaya
es gnal-u
em
Erevan
Tomorrowl go-FUT.PART AUX Yerevan
‘Tomorrow I shall go to Yerevan.’(70)Prescriptive uses of this form occur in utterances with Imperative forms, e.g.:The Resultative is derived: a) from root and suffixal intransitive verbs except non-terminative verbs
of activity: k’aylel ‘walk’, mlavel ‘mew’, vazel ‘run’, etc., and non-countable verbs of volition,
possession, or relation: uzenal ‘want’, kamenal ‘desire’, unenal ‘have’, gitenal ‘know’, etc. (see
Barseyyan 1953 for more representative lists); b) from the passive form of transitive verbs marked by
the suffix {v}, expressing the reflexive, anticausative and other meanings.",[16]
