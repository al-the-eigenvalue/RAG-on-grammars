‘friend, will you go up to take it or me, I go up to take (it)’[B06.050.00:48]In Abui, focus is primarily encoded by fronting to the left-periphery of the
clause.16 This position is marked by an pause in intonation that follows the focussed
constituent. This pragmatic structure may interact with the focus SVC. The minor verb
and its U argument are extracted from the core of the clause (realized as contiguous
SVC) and placed in the clause-initial pragmatic position. An NP can be extracted to the
focus position without leaving any pronominal trace. This is illustrated in (117) where
the NP kawen ‘machete’ occurs clause-initially.

[B02.174.00:12]The status of ne-d-o in (118) is puzzling. It might be analysed as grammaticalized to a
focus pronoun, just like the form ne-d-e. The pause in intonation between nedo and na
in (118) may be used as evidence supporting such an analysis.17 In my analysis, I choose
The left edge of the clause is a typical location of focussed constituent also in other Papuan languages, as
argued by Donohue (2005:187).
17 In fact, a similar construction occurs in the neighbouring language Kabola (cf. Stokhof: 1987:647) where a
pronoun combined with a morpheme -ri, which is analyzed as a case marker, may be fronted to a pragmatic
position as illustrated in (2). Interestingly, the morpheme -ri may be combined with the inceptive aspectual
marker so.

16SERIAL VERB CONSTRUCTIONS387for the analogy between the attributive SVC and focus construction and analyse the
form ne-d-o as a verb phrase that appears in the clause-initial pragmatic position. As
illustrated in (119), the pragmatic position has a nominalising effect on the verb phrase
occurring in it. The pragmatic position marks any constituent appearing in it as given.
The resulting nominal ne-d-o has a lot in common with pronouns. The pragmatic
position does not allow free pronouns, which cannot be extracted from the clause.

Also in this fragment, the fronted VP seems nominalized and is marked by a pause in
intonation as being located in the pragmatic position. The nominalized VP e-d-o is
followed by the free pronoun a (2SG).

[B02.048.17:28]As discussed in section 6.3, also adverbial modifiers may occur in the clause-initial
pragmatic position. The stem do ‘hold’ should not be confused with the anaphoric
demonstrative do (PRX), as illustrated in (121). Anaphoric demonstratives do not
combine with pronominal prefixes, unlike nouns, verbs and numerals.18

SVC with m ‘take, be in’
The generic verb m is glossed either as ‘take’ or ‘be in’ depending on the grammatical
context in which it is used. The decisive factors are the type and animacy value of its
arguments. In contexts where the minor verb combines with an animate A argument it
is glossed as ‘take’, in other contexts as ‘be in’.","[409, 410]"

denote substances rather than well-defined objects. These nouns typically combine with
modifier nouns that specify their shape and size. In enumeration, the modifier noun
typically co-occurs with the quantifier because the head noun is not sufficiently
individuated to be quantified (see also 4.4.4.1). This is illustrated in (72), where the head
noun seng ‘money’ combines with two modifier nouns that specify the shape of the
‘money’ substance. The banknotes are referred to as watala ‘leaves’, while for coins the
modifier noun tipai ‘iron’ is used to indicate the material from which this type of
money is made. Note that both NPs refer to a type of money and not to a type of
leaves or iron, which would be the case if these structures were compounds.

(cf. Payne 1997:63). As illustrated in (75), stative verbs and adjectives follow the head
noun. In (a), the adjective kul ‘white’ follows the head noun kaai ‘dog’, as well as the
stative verbs kiding ‘small’, foka ‘big’ and fila ‘young’ in (b-d):
(75)a. kaai kulb. faladog white
‘white dog’c. bataakidinghouse small

be.big

‘little child’As discussed in section 3.5.1, adjectives are syntactically differentiated from stative
verbs. Both grammatical categories may serve as modifiers in an NP, but stative verbs
may also serve as a head of a VP and combine with a single argument. In Abui,
arguments always precede the verb, which means that a structure consisting of a noun
followed by a stative verb is ambiguous and may be interpreted either as an NP or as a
VP. On the other hand, the adjectives cannot be used as predicates, heading a VP.
These properties are summarized in Table 18:
Table 18: Distributional properties of adjectives and stative verbs
GRAMMATICAL CATEGORY NP DOMAIN VP DOMAIN
ADJECTIVE
STATIVE VERBModifier
Modifier*
PredicateThe functional asymmetry between adjectives and stative verbs has a consequence, that
only the structures consisting of a noun followed by an adjective are unambiguous NPs.
This restricted functional property of a noun phrase with an adjectival modifier is
further exemplified in (76). In (a, d, g) the adjective modifier of the noun phrase has an
attributive function, but as illustrated in (b, e, h) it does not have a predicative function.
Instead a complex verb must be used that incorporates the adjectival element:160(76)CHAPTER IVa. kaai kulb. kaai kuldog white

‘the banana is ripe’As discussed in section 3.5.1, the grammatical category of adjectives is closed; it
contains only six items. The set of stative verbs is much larger, as shown in section
3.4.4.8. Therefore most NPs that contain an attributive modifier are ambiguous.
Structures that consist of a single noun and a stative verb may be interpreted nonpredicatively as an NP or predicatively consisting of a stative verb combined with a
single argument realized as a bare NP. This ambiguity is illustrated in (77). The
structure consisting of the noun ama ‘person’ and the stative verb tukoi ‘be strong’ is
ambiguous and can be interpreted either as an NP (a) or as N + VP (b).
(77)a. amatukoiperson be.strong
‘strong person’b. amatukoiperson be.strong
‘the person is strong’Structures similar to those in (77) are disambiguated when another NP-domain
constituent is present. This is illustrated in (78), where the numeral nuku ‘one’ follows
the stative verb bui ‘be short’. In Abui, numerals may not modify verbs and therefore
the structure in (b) is identified as an NP. Another constituent that occurs exclusively in
NP domain is the plural quantifier loku (PL). In (d), its presence identifies the given
structure as an NP.

‘the first wives’As illustrated in (78), the quantifiers nuku ‘one’ and loku (PL) follow the stative verb.
More details about the NP syntax dealing with more than one modifier can be found in
section 4.4.5.
There are cases, where an NP containing a stative verb seems lexicalized. In
(79), the head noun ama ‘person’ combines with a stative verb. The noun ama ‘person’NOUNS AND NOUN PHRASES161may occur independently referring to an unspecified human being. The noun ama
‘person’ combines with the stative verb kang ‘be good’ to refer neutrally to a human
being, as also illustrated in (80). The stative verb kang ‘be good’ can be alternated with
the stative verb beka ‘be bad’, but in that case, the NP has a negative connotation of a
‘bad guy’.
(79)amakangamaperson
be.good
‘person, guy’bekaperson be.bad
‘bad guy, villain’The NP ama kang ‘person, guy’ seems lexicalized. It is typically used to refer to
inhabitants of a village or area. Note that area is referred to as a possessor of the noun
ama ‘person’ with the possessive prefix he- (3II.AL).

3II.AL-person be.good
‘guy from Takalelang, Takalelang person’Pido he-amakangplace 3II.AL-person be.good
‘guy from Pido, Pido person’Another example of a lexicalized NP is given in (81), where the modifier kira
‘be hard’ combines with the head noun pikai ‘head’. The NP refers metaphorically to a
stubborn person rather than to a hard head.
(81)pikaikirahead
be.hard
‘stubborn person, pig-headed person’Other instances of lexicalized NPs that refer to a characteristic property of a human
referent are given in (82). The property is assigned to a body part and the human
referent is expressed in some cases by an obligatory possessor marking.

discourse. The two functions of Abui demonstratives are distinguished syntactically.
This is illustrated in (83). In (a), the demonstrative do (PRX) refers to a proximate spatial162CHAPTER IVlocation of the referent fala ‘house’. In (b), the same form refers to the proximate
discourse location of the same referent fala ‘house’.
(83)a. dofalab. falaPRX
house
‘this house (located by me)’dohouse PRX
‘this house (I talk about)’This shows that those demonstratives that precede the head noun indicate its spatial
location; they are deictic demonstratives (DEICT). The demonstratives that follow the
head noun indicate its discourse location; they are anaphoric demonstratives (DEM).
Both functions are further discussed below. In Abui, both deictic demonstratives as
well as anaphoric demonstratives provide anchoring along a number of axes: SPEAKERADDRESSEE, PROXIMAL-DISTAL, and HIGH-LOW (see also section 3.5.2.1). Two of these axes
apply to anaphoric demonstratives (SPEAKER-ADDRESSEE, PROXIMAL-DISTAL), and all three
of them apply to deictic demonstratives. In the remainder of this section, I deal with
both types of demonstratives. In section 4.4.3.1, I give an overview of the axis that
constitute Abui deictic system and exemplify the use of deictic demonstratives within
an NP. In 4.4.3.2, I discuss anaphoric demonstratives.
4.4.3.1
Deictic demonstratives
Deictic demonstratives combine with nouns to indicate distance or orientation of the
referent with respect to speech participants (cf. Payne 1997:103). An overview of Abui
deictic demonstratives is given in Table 19.

Anaphoric demonstratives
Demonstratives following the head noun identify the referent in discourse. They
indicate the referential properties of the nouns such as [±specific] and [±definite]. The
proximal and medial anaphoric demonstratives have a relative frame of reference; they
alternate the viewpoint (V) over speaker or addressee. Definiteness is generally defined
as the identifiability of the referent for both the speaker and the addressee. Considering
this, only the proximal and medial anaphoric demonstratives indicate a [+definite]
referent. An overview of the anaphoric demonstratives is given in Table 20:NOUNS AND NOUN PHRASES163Table 20: Abui anaphoric demonstratives

also by lexical items that are borrowed from Malay, as illustrated in (15). The two uses
of sakola display the location-activity relationship; tulusa displays the undergoeractivity relationship:GRAMMATICAL CATEGORIES(15)a. sakola73b. tulusa‘school/school, teach’‘writing/write’As exemplified above, ambiguous items are identified as either noun or verb by
the syntactic and morphological context, in which they occur. The presented data
suggests that Abui sides with Austronesian languages in categorial indeterminacy and
not with Papuan (cf. Foley, 1998:509, 512; Himmelmann, 2005:126-131), which
normally have a strict division in nominal and verbal categories.13.2.3Distributional propertiesAt the word level, nouns are characterized as either free or bound roots that may
combine with pronominal prefixes (for an overview of pronominal inventory, see
section 3.3). Pronominal prefixes serve to express possessors (for a detailed discussion
of possession, see section 4.2). Nominal morphology is restricted to the possessor
marking by pronominal prefixes. Other inflections such as for number, case, class, or
gender are not found in Abui.2
Two free roots combined with pronominal prefixes are given in (16). The
pronominal prefixes belong to set I, glossed as AL(inenable) below. The free root feela
‘friend’ combines with pronominal prefix ne- (1SG.AL). The free root maama ‘father’
combines with pronominal prefix he- (3II.AL):
(16)ne-feela‘my friend’1SG.AL-friendhe-maama‘his father’3II.AL-fatherBound roots combine with pronominal prefixes from set III, glossed as INAL(ienable)

pronominal prefixes na- (1SG.INAL) and ha- (3II.INAL) respectively.

combine with the pronominal prefixes that express a possessor (see section 4.2.2). The
nouns in (16) combine optionally with pronominal prefixes (see section 4.2.3).
Nouns never combine with pronominal prefixes from set II, glossed as
REC(ipient) below, which may only be attached to verbs. In (18), this restriction
1 Categorical indeterminacy is a typical feature of Austronesian languages. As discussed by (Foley, 1998)
Austronesian morphology is typified by the roots that ‘exhibit categorical indeterminacy, i.e. a given root can
be used nominally or verbally without derivation by being head of syntactically nominal or verbal
construction’ (Foley, 1998:509). However, ‘the roots in Papuan languages show a sharp division into nominal
and verbal categories and can only change via morphological derivation’ (Foley, 1998:512). Another Papuan
language that shows similar categorical indeterminacy is Sulka. This language has been in long-termed contact
with Austronesian languages (Reesink, 2005:145) which resulted in sharing the typological feature of
indeterminacy with AN languages (Reesink, 2005:163).
2 The lack of case and number inflection of nouns is claimed to be a common feature among other Papuan
languages (Foley, 1986:93-96) as they rather employ verbal affixation to signal case relations.","[94, 95, 96]"
"3 Grammatical Categories
In this chapter, I describe Abui grammatical categories. Grammatical categories are
sometimes referred to as ‘part-of-speech classes’; they are the building blocks of
linguistic structures. Grammatical categories are either open or closed. Open categories
contain a virtually unlimited number of items, while closed categories have a limited set
of members. In Abui, open grammatical categories are only nouns and verbs. Closed
grammatical categories are adjectives, deictics, quantifiers, aspectual markers, linkers,
adverbs and question words.
In Abui, many lexical items appear to be ambiguous. Their categorial
membership must be determined by the combination of their distributional, functional,
and semantic properties (cf. Schachter, 1985; Andward et al., 1997). With the term
‘distributional properties’ I refer to the word-internal (morphological) and wordexternal (syntactic) distribution of an item. In section 3.1, I give an overview of Abui
morphology describing various morpheme types (bound, free, prefixes, suffixes, roots,
and stems).
Word-external (syntactic) distributional properties refer to the status of items in
syntactic units such as phrases, clauses and sentences. Items may be restricted in their
distribution within syntactic units; not all items may occur as heads. Items have
different functional properties. They can express various grammatical functions such as
arguments, aspectual markers, or linkers. Finally, items can have a different type of
reference (time-stable or versatile) and different referents (persons, events, etc.).
In section 3.2, I describe nouns. Nouns are items that canonically refer to timestable concepts such as persons, objects or places. The nominal reference is permanent.
Pronouns are discussed in section 3.3. Pronouns refer to time-stable concepts,
however, their reference is not permanent as the nominal reference but versatile and
context dependent. In section 3.4, I discuss Abui verbs. Verbs are defined
morphologically as items that may combine with REC pronominal prefix and aspectual
markers. Syntactically, they are the head of a verb phrase. Verbs serve as predicates in a
clause and may combine with arguments.
The remainder of this chapter gives an overview of closed grammatical
categories; they are discussed in section 3.5. The closed grammatical categories are
adjectives (3.5.1), demonstratives (3.5.2), quantifiers (3.5.3), aspectual markers (3.5.4),
conjunction markers (3.5.6), adverbs (3.5.5), and question words (3.5.7).","[89, 90]"

In this chapter, I give an overview of Abui phonology. In other words, I discuss the
different sounds of the language and how they are combined together. The data
presented in this chapter are from the Takalelang, Alila and Tifol Afeng dialect. In a
small number of cases, data from the Fanating dialect are used. These cases are
explicitly marked.
This chapter is organized as follows: in section 2.1.1, the phonemic inventory of
Abui is discussed. The distribution of the phonemes within words and syllables are
described in 2.2, with subsections for consonants (2.2.1) and vowels (2.2.2). Syllable
structure is described in 2.3 and further referred to in 2.4 where I give an overview of
prosodic word types. In a prosodic word, syllables are stressed following the iambic
pattern (2.5); a penultimate heavy syllable causes the final syllable to be extrametrical
(2.5.3). A small number of Abui word has lexical tone (2.5.4). This chapter ends in 2.6
with an overview of orthographic conventions used in this grammar.","[46, 47, 48]"

typological characteristics of a language such as phonology, morphology, and syntax.
Foley (1998, 506-515) listed a number of typological features (phonological,
morphological and syntactic), which distinguish Austronesian languages from NonAustronesian languages. In what follows, I specify a number of diagnostic features,
listed by Foley (1998), for Abui. A list of features for three grammatical domains is
followed by a section in which Abui features are evaluated in the context of
Austronesian and Papuan languages, as discussed by Foley (1998, 2000).

found in other TNG languages, and instead voiced stops are found. Fricatives are
restricted, as is common in Papuan languages (cf. Foley, 2000:367-8). There is also
phonemic contrast between stop [t] and the flap [r], and there are two liquids [l] and [r].
Both of these features are not very common in TNG languages; but are almost
universal in Austronesian languages (cf. Pawley, 1998:670-4; Foley, 2000:369). Papuan
languages typically lack consonant clusters, or use epenthetic vowels to split them (cf.
Foley, 2000:369), but many Austronesian languages of Eastern Indonesia show the
same tendency (Klamer, 2002:367). We can conclude that Abui shares some
characteristics with Papuan languages, and some with the Austronesian languages
surrounding it.

verbs may combine with up to three bound aspectual markers (two
suffixes, one clitic)
roots display categorial indeterminacy, sharp division only between
prototypical nouns (persons) and verbsEvaluation: Abui nouns do not inflect for number nor are they classified for gender, as
is common in many Papuan languages (cf. Foley, 2000:371-2). Nouns are classified
through posture verbs such as ‘stand’, ‘sit’ – long-shaped objects ‘stand’, flat-shaped
objects ‘lie’ etc. Such classification systems are well-known from some of the highland
languages (cf. Lang, 1975). There is no case in Abui, grammatical relations are signalled
with pronominal prefixes on the verb or by additional verbs employed in serial verb
construction. Abui has semantic alignment, a feature also found in other languages in
Eastern Indonesia, Papuan as well as Austronesian (cf. Klamer, To appear-a). Pronouns
in Abui show an inclusive/exclusive distinction, which is typical for Austronesian
languages, but rarely found among Papuan languages (cf. Foley, 2000:376).
Agglutinative morphological structure and elaborate verbal morphology are
typical TNG features, including the common distinction between ‘medial’ and ‘final’
verbs. In Abui, final verbs are typically fully inflected, medial verbs lack inflection.
While verbs in many TNG languages typically carry subject suffixes, Abui lacks such
subject suffixes. Instead, pronominal prefixes co-indexing undergoers are found, which
are common in many Papuan languages (cf. Foley, 2000:378). Abui roots display a high
degree of categorial indeterminacy. It contrasts with the typical situation in Papuan
languages which make a sharp distinction between nouns and verbs, and in this respect
Abui sides with Austronesian languages that commonly display a high degree of
categorial indeterminacy (cf. Foley, 2000:370).","[31, 32, 33]"

‘Simon is coming down’Pronominal prefixesIn Abui, the bound pronouns are prefixed to nouns and verbs. Bound pronouns are
divided into three formally distinct sets. Pronominal prefixes are polysemous. They
combine with verbs to express the Undergoer (U) arguments and with nouns to express
possessors.4
Pronominal prefixes from all three sets combine with verbs to express or coindex the Undergoer (U) arguments. The U arguments identified as LOC (location) are
expressed with set I, REC (recipient) with set II, and PAT (patient) with set III (for more
details, see section 5.5). Pronominal prefixes from sets I and III combine also with
nouns. They express or co-index possessors (see 4.2). The prefixes from set III serve to
express possessor in inalienable possessive relations (INAL), set I is used to express
possessor in alienable possessive relations (AL). The prefixes from set I are
polysemous, they refer to locations and possessors. In fact, possessors are encoded as a
‘location’ of the possessed entity.5 An inalienably possessed body part is marked in the
same way as a PAT(ient) argument because both are fully controlled by the POSSESSOR
Polysemous pronominal prefixes used in both nominal and verbal domain are found in other related Alor
Pantar languages such as Teiwa (Klamer and Kratochvíl, 2006; Klamer, In prep.), and Adang (cf. Haan
2001:38, 46). Steltenpool and Stap (1959) report polysemous prefixes for Ekari (referred to as Kapauku), a
language from the Wissel Lakes-Kemandoga group of the TNG family. They observe a similarity between
possessor marking on body parts and kinship terms and the object marking: ‘considering the extremely
passive nature of the acquisition of such ‘possession’ it is not a coincidence that these prefixes are reminiscent
of the passive voice’ (Steltenpool and Stap, 1958:20, translation F.K.).
5 Polysemous pronominal possessor and benefactive markers are also found in Lower Grand Valley Dani
(Bromley 1981:190). Lichtenberk (2002) and Margetts (2004) argue for possessive-benefactive polysemy in
broader cross-linguistic perspective.

DISTRte-to-ta-In the table, prefixes are organized according to their reference. The egophoric prefixes,
referring to the speech act participants are listed first. In egophoric plural forms there is
no distinction between sets I and III; while set II displays free alternation in plural
forms (1PL.I and 2PL). The allophoric prefixes refer to other than the speech act
participants. In allophoric reference, two subtypes are distinguished: 3I and 3II. The 3I
prefixes share the same referent with the A argument within the same domain. The 3II
prefixes do not share the same referent with the A argument within that domain.
The referential domain of allophoric and distributive prefixes is maximally a clause. In
complex structures with the intersective linker ba (LNK) as illustrated in (28), the 3I
prefix refers to the nearest NP within the structure. In this case, the 3I possessive prefix
de- (3I.AL) co-indexes the NP Timo as possessor and the A argument of the verb on
‘make’.

Open grammatical categories are only nouns and verbs. Closed grammatical categories
are adjectives, deictics, quantifiers, aspectual markers, linkers, adverbs, and question
words. There is a closed set of generic verbs which are monosegmental roots and have
a number of grammatical functions in argument realization and verb derivation.
NOUNS. Abui nouns are only identified unambiguously by their referential properties
when they have animate referents. Inanimate nouns are typically underspecified for
number, shape, or size; in other words, their reference is generic. Many lexical items are
categorially indetermined and may refer to objects and substances as well as to events.
Abui nouns are divided in two groups by possessive inflection. Inherently
possessed nouns require possessive inflection. Semantically these are body parts and
kinship terms. This distinction is illustrated in (3), where the bound nominal stem min
‘nose’ combines with the inalienable possessive prefix na- (1SG.INAL). In (b), the noun
fala ‘house’ belongs to the second group of optionally possessed nouns. The possessive
prefix ne- (1SG.AL) marks the alienable possession. In third person, the possessor is
optionally expressed with a noun that precedes the possessum denoting noun, as
illustrated in (c).

(PROPOSS), with a number of adnominal modifiers such as deictic demonstratives
(DEICT), modifier nouns (NMOD), stative verbs (V), adjectives (ADJ), quantifiers (QUANT),
and anaphoric demonstratives (DEM) in a fixed order, as illustrated in (4).
(4)NP Æ(DEICT) (NPOSS PROPOSS-) N (NMOD) (ADJ/V) (QUANT) (DEM)Optionally, an NP may be modified by a modifier linked to the head noun with the
linker ba (LNK); typically, a relative clause (RC). The linked modifier may either precede
or follow the head noun as illustrated in (5). It forms a single intonational unit with the
modified NP. In (a), the modifier clause precedes the head noun bataa ‘wood’. In (b),
the modifier clause follows the head noun. The second order is more common.

Controlling and volitional participants of an event are identified as actors. Actors are
realized as A arguments with NPs and/or free pronouns. This is illustrated in (6). In (a),
the A argument is expressed with the NP maama ‘father’ and the free pronoun di (3A);
in (b), the A argument is expressed by the free pronoun di (3A).

arguments with NPs and/or bound pronouns. This is illustrated in (7). In (a), the U

‘Simon chases me’DISTR.REC-3II.PAT-put.farIn (a), the U argument nala nuku ‘something’ is co-indexed as LOC; it has a specific
non-individuated referent that must be understood in a very broad sense as ‘purpose’ or
‘reason’. In (b), the same U argument is co-indexed as REC; its referent is
[+individuated] and probably a human or some other clearly distinguished referent. In
(c), the U argument kaai ‘dog’ is affected by the event chasing, and effectively chased
away. While in (a) and (b) the meaning of the verb loi was translated as ‘bark’, the
translation ‘chase’ is more appropriate in (c). As illustrated in (d), the use of the PAT
bound pronoun is not felicitous to refer to first and second person participants.
Instead, the benefactive serial construction with the generic verb l ‘give’ must be used.
The first person participant is expressed as the U argument of the verb l ‘give’. Note
that the verb loi ‘put far’ combines with two bound pronouns. The distributive form
to- (DISTR.REC) refers to a plural number of participants that are ‘recipients’ of chasing.
The PAT form ha- (3II.PAT) indicates that a single participant is chased. The first person
prefix may not appear here. The combinations of prefixes in double U transitive
constructions are restricted.
Depending on its semantic properties a single participant of an event may be
expressed as different types of arguments of the same verb. In (9), the single participant
of the event of ‘leaving (towards a DC)’ is expressed as actor (a), experiencer (b), and
undergoer (c).

Continuative stems (CNT) indicate events that are viewed as having neither initial nor

syllables are common; consonant clusters within one syllable are avoided; the nucleus is
maximally bimoraic (CVVC).
Syllables are combined to form prosodic words, in which heavy syllables
(syllables with a complex nucleus) attract stress. Light syllables have a simple nucleus
and are mostly open. Abui feet are iambic counted from right to left, with an optional
extrametrical syllable in cases where the penultimate syllable is heavy. Stress is
phonetically realized as lengthening of the stressed syllable, rising of pitch, and
increasing of intensity. Distinctions in pitch are lexicalised in a number of cases so that
one can speak of lexical tone in Abui.
MORPHOLOGY. Abui can be characterized as an agglutinating polysynthetic language.
Nouns tend to be morphologically simple; the possessive inflection is the only nominal
inflection. Verbs tend to be morphologically complex; they are inflected for person and
aspect. In (2), I give an overview of morphological structures found in Abui. Words
consist minimally of a free root (i). Free roots may combine with optional morphemes,
prefixes (ii), suffixes (iii), bound roots (iv), or both prefix and suffix (v). Free roots may
form a complex stem with a bound root and still combine with affixes (vi). A number
of roots are bound; they obligatorily combine with prefixes (vii), suffixes (viii), or both
of them (ix), other bound roots (x), bound roots and suffixes (xi), or all of them (xii) to
form a word.","[34, 35]"

Papuan languages, inflections for case or number are not found (cf. Foley, 1986:93-6).
The prototypical construction of possession expresses the relationship of ownership
between a human possessor and an inanimate possessum. This construction has a
number of extensions to refer to other semantic relationships such as kinship or partwhole relation. The Abui possessive construction consists of a noun expressing the
possessum and a pronominal prefix expressing the possessor. Optionally, in third
person the possessor is expressed with an additional NP. This is illustrated in (15). In
(a), the prefix ne- (1SG.AL) expresses that the possessor of fala ‘house’ is the speaker. In
(b), the prefix he- (3II.AL) expresses the possessor of sepeda ‘bike’. The pronoun refers
to the NP maama ‘father’.

and a set of OPTIONALLY POSSESSED NOUNS. 3 The set of inherently possessed nouns
contains bound nominal roots that refer to most body parts, a number of kinship terms
and a single relational noun.","[161, 162, 163]"
"4.4.4QuantifiersIn an NP, quantifiers (QUANT) indicate the quantity of the referent. In Abui, there are
two types of quantifiers: (i) numeral quantifiers that express the exact quantity of the
countable referent (see 4.4.4.1); (ii) non-numeral quantifiers that express a fuzzy
quantity of both countable and uncountable referents (see 4.4.4.2). Both types of
quantifiers are discussed in section 3.5.3. In an NP, quantifiers follow the head noun.
4.4.4.1
Numeral quantifiers
A number of NPs with numeral quantifiers are given in (85). In all cases the numeral
follows the head noun:

‘one man and one woman, they gave birth, two sons (were born)’[B02.023.00:03]As discussed in 4.4.1, nouns with inanimate reference denote substances rather than
well-defined objects. In quantified NPs, these nouns combine with modifier nouns that
specify their shape and size in order to be enumerated. In their function, modifier
nouns are very much like classifiers. The modifier noun bika ‘kernel’ co-occurs in
enumeration with nouns denoting smallish round objects, as illustrated in (87).

kang ‘person’, and ura ‘sibling’ combine with the modifier noun upi ‘fruit’ to refer to a
number of unspecified referents.

Non-numeral quantifiers
A fuzzy quantity of the referent is expressed by non-numeral quantifiers (see also
section 3.5.3.2). Non-numeral quantifiers follow the head noun. There are three nonnumeral quantifiers that will be discussed here; the plural quantifier loku (PL), the
quantifier kabei ‘few, little’ and faring ‘much, many’.
The quantifier loku expresses the plural quantity and is glossed as (PL). The
quantifier loku (PL) can never be followed by a numeral, which proves that it is not an
instance of plural inflection but a plural quantifier. It combines with referents that are
countable and individuated; such referents are mostly human. The meaning of the
quantifier loku (PL) can be translated with ‘many’ or ‘several’ or with a plural form of
the modified noun; nevertheless, these translations seem to be less felicitous as glosses.
A number of examples are given in (91):

situation where the speaker referred to four pigs. In (b), the noun fír ‘star’ is combined
with loku (PL) to mean a high number of stars. Clearly, the quantifier loku (PL)
indicates “more than one”.
(93)a. felokub. fírpig

‘pigs’lokustar PL
‘stars’In (94), the quantifier loku (PL) combines with proper names that refer to persons,

people associated with the persons, groups or areas expressed by the proper name. A
number of examples is also given in (11) above.

a small quantity of an uncountable referent.

[B02.098.16:52]Combinations of adnominal modifiersThe order of adnominal modifiers in an NP is fixed. As discussed in section 4.4, only
the deictic demonstratives (DEICT) precede the head noun; other modifiers follow the
head noun. The order of modifiers is schematically represented in (98), which is a
repetition of the same scheme given in (67):The Malay word kepala adat refers to the ‘head of custom, habbits’; that is somebody with the traditional
knowledge who is able to negotiate and enter various contracts in a culturally recognized way.","[186, 187, 188, 189]"

In this chapter, I discuss Abui nouns and noun phrases. Abui nouns are defined by
their referential properties as lexical items referring to time-stable concrete entities
(unique persons, places, or objects, discussed in 4.1). There are also lexical items that
refer to less concrete (typically) uncountable objects and substances. These lexical items
are ambiguous as they may as well refer to events, and they are analysed as categorially
indetermined (see section 3.2.2). Their grammatical category is determined by their
syntactic context. When an ambiguous item is inserted in the head position of an NP
structure; it is identified as a noun.
In Abui, there is a systematic difference between animate and inanimate
referents. Animate referents are typically expressed by unambiguously nominal lexical
items. Nouns referring to animates are treated differently in grammatical operations
such as possessive inflection or person inflection on the verbs (see 3.2.4). Inanimate
nouns have a more generic reference and denote substances rather than individuated
objects; they are underspecified for number, shape or size. In discourse, inanimate
nouns often combine with other elements that specify their number, shape, or size.
Abui nouns combine with pronominal prefixes that express possessors (see
section 4.2). Nouns can be derived by compounding and nominalization of verbal
roots, as discussed in section 4.3. Nouns serve as the head constituent of a noun
phrase, presented in section 4.4. In addition to possessors, the head noun combines
with a number of adnominal modifiers such as deictic demonstratives, modifier nouns,
stative verbs, adjectives, quantifiers and anaphoric demonstratives. The order of these
constituents is fixed (see 4.4.5). Optionally, an NP may contain an embedded modifier,
typically a relative clause (see section 4.5). Besides expressing arguments, NPs may
serve as the main predicate of a sentence, as a nominal predicate. This chapter ends
with an overview of nominal predicates in section 4.6.","[153, 154, 155, 156]"
"1.10 Outline of the grammar and the presentation of data
This book is organized as follows. In chapter 2, I give a description of the Abui
phonological system. Morphology and grammatical categories are given in chapter 3. In
chapter 4, nouns and noun phrases are described. Chapter 5 discusses argument
realization. Verb phrases and clauses are described in chapter 6. The final two chapters
focus on multi-verb constructions. In chapter 7, I describe complex verbs; chapter 8
gives an overview of serial verb constructions. In the appendixes, a number of texts are
given as well as Abui-English and English-Abui wordlists.
Abui language data are presented in the following fashion, as illustrated in (22).",[46]
"3.2.2Categorial indeterminacyThere are a number of ambiguous lexical items that are identified as nouns or verbs.
The ambiguity is resolved by the syntactic context in which the items occur. Consider
the form luuk in (8).

3I.AL-betel.vine bite.CPL
‘while people were dancing, the two were eating their betel nut’
[B02.087.08:17]The lexical item luuk in (8) is identified a noun in (a) because it combines with the
possessive prefix and serves as an argument of the verb wida ‘become like that,
resemble’. In (b), the form is identified as a verb because it combines with a single
argument expressed with the noun ama ‘person’. In both cases the form luuk is
followed by the anaphoric demonstrative do that marks the end of a domain. In (a), do
(PRX) marks the end of an NP. In (b), it has a nominalising function, it marks the end of
a clause that serves as background information for the second clause.
Another ambiguous item is tur, illustrated in (9). Both examples are taken from
a narrative. In (a), the form tur refers to a ‘spoon’ that fell out from the house and
must be picked up again. In (b), the form tur is used as a predicate ‘scoop up’ and
combines with the U argument is fat ma ‘cooked corn’.

same form yaa is used in (b), where it refers to the activity of ‘going’.

syllable is characterized by a monomoraic nucleus; the nucleus of a heavy syllable is
bimoraic. A bimoraic nucleus contains either a long vowel or a vowel sequence that
both attract the stress (see 2.5). In this section, I discuss the prosodic words in three
subgroups according to their composition and function. These factors seem to be
reflected by the phonological shape of each group. As first, in section 2.4.1, I discuss
Abui nouns. Abui nouns tend to be morphologically simple and consist of maximally
three syllables allowing heavy syllables typically in word-final position and in a few cases
in the penultimate position. In section 2.4.2, I give an overview of loans that are
adapted to Abui prosodic word structure. The verbs and function words are discussed
in section 2.4.3. They tend to be morphologically complex and consist of up to five
syllables.","[65, 66]"

‘he tries to leave (deliberately)’ [B05.045.01]The single participant is realized as an experiencer as free and bound pronoun with
single reference in (a). In (b) it is expressed only as a free pronoun. The minor verb ra
‘reach, attempt’ expresses speaker’s intention to ‘leave’. The use of the inceptive re
‘reach, try’ is illustrated in (211) where it combines with the verb natet-d-i ‘stand up,
get standing’:

[B05.044.05]The continuative ra ‘reach, attempt, persist’ indicates an event as being performed in a
persistent way. The single (human) participant is realized as the U argument with the
PAT prefix. Because the speaker mostly expresses his ‘wish’ to perform an activity, the
free pronoun is omitted and the A≡UPAT experiencer construction is alternated, as
illustrated in (212). In both cases the major verb is inflected with perfective suffix -i
(PFV) although the expressed situation must be considered as an instance of irrealis
mode (cf. Payne 1997:244):

[B05.044.03]In negative clauses such as in (213), the verb ra ‘reach’ can be the best translated as
‘still’ and has many similarities with an adverbial modifier. In (a), the item still can be
interpreted as a verb; however, in (b), the predicate dara does not show person
agreement with the A argument na (1SG). The form functions as an adverbial modifier
(see 6.3).

[B07.075.01]The form dara following inanimate participants reminds us of the adverb ‘still’, and
considering the restrictions on the use of the active pronouns with inanimates, it is
likely that the form dara in (214) is adverbial. It is quite obvious that the semantics of
the verb ra ‘reach, attempt, persist’ can be easily extended to an adverbial use.","[438, 439]"

‘grandfather, your second grandson will actually sit a bit’[B02.043.14:32]As illustrated in (109), the linker ba (LNK) may link bare NPs with a single modifier,
usually a stative verb in (a, b). The structures in (a, b) have a restrictive reading.
Consider also the distinction between (b) and (c). While (b) refers to a person that is
bad because of his deeds, (c) has an open reading and refers to a ‘bad guy’, i.e. a person
who does not necessarily do anything bad, but has a potential to do so.

ba (LNK) is obligatory when the following verb dakun-i ‘become dirty’ is to be
interpreted as a modifier (a). The intersective linker ba (LNK) follows the modifier
palata ‘be cold’ and introduces a relative clause. In (b) and (c), the intersective linker ba
(LNK) is not present; consequently, both constructions have a different reading. In (c),
the anaphoric demonstrative do (PRX) follows the verb dakun-i ‘become dirty’. The
demonstrative is not interpreted as an adnominal modifier because the verb dakun-i
‘become dirty’ is not embedded but predicates over the NP ya palata ‘cold water’. For
the clause level functions of anaphoric demonstratives see section 6.4.3.

meting ‘betel nut and betel vine’ is logically the U argument of the verb mi ‘take’ but in

[B01.079.02:01]In (112) a complex structure serves as the U argument of the verb tahai ‘search’. In this
structure, the intersective linker ba (LNK) links the bare NP kafiei ‘goat’ with the relative
clause nai-d-i nu ‘became lost (some time ago)’. Note that the head noun kafiei ‘goat’ is
the single argument of the verb nai-d- ‘get lost’.

[B07.013.01]In (113), the bare NP fe ‘pig’ combines with a relative clause. Observe that the head
noun fe ‘pig’ is co-indexed as the possessor of the noun toku ‘leg’ in the relative clause.
The noun toku ‘leg’ serves as the U argument of the verb kor ‘bind’. The A argument
of the verb kor ‘bind’ is not expressed. Note that the relativized NP fe ‘pig’ is coindexed with the possessive prefix he- (3II.AL) and PAT prefix ha- (3II.PAT) inside the

which it shares its U argument fala ‘house’. The A argument of the verb ong ‘make’ is
tayoka ‘earthquake’.

‘that house that was destroyed by the earthquake, people are again repairing it’In (115), one of the most complex structures found in my corpus is given. The NP
headed by fala ‘house’ contains a possessor e-maama mantan kades ‘your father,
former village head’. This NP is linked with a large relative clause given between curly172CHAPTER IVbrackets. The example comes from a conversation concerning the place name Fota
Ailol. The name refers to a place with a large wide stone that used to be a resting place
in the old days. The speaker described the stone as being located with respect to the
house of the addressee’s uncle. He refers to the house as standing below a big and wide
stone like this.

[B02.127.01:35]From the previous examples, we can conclude that the linker ba (LNK) links an NP and
a modifier in a structure that functions as single NP. In fact, this definition can be
expanded also to the clause level, as the linker ba (LNK) serves to link verbs in a single
clause (see also section 3.5.6). The linked ba (LNK) has an intersective function; it links
two constituents to a single unit on the level of one of them.
In the complex NPs given so far, the NP precedes the linker ba (LNK) linking it
with a modifier constituent (adnominal modifier or a clause). The modified NP may be
considered as the head of the construction. However, in some cases, the modifying
constituent precedes the noun or the noun may be omitted. The modifier constituent
has either deictic or possessive function and its location corresponds to the location of
deictics and possessors within the NP. In (116), the relative clause nopa mia ‘be
touching on me’ precedes the NP bataa do ‘the wood’. The linker ba (LNK) follows the
clause. In (b), the expected constituent order is given which is also attested.

function is deictic; its structure is parallel to that of an NP. As discussed above, deictic
modifiers precede the head noun in the NP.

ama ‘person’ is not expressed but its expected position is marked with ∅ following the
relative clause. Because the head is not expressed intersective linker ba (LNK) follows
the quantifier loku (PL). The complex NP serves as argument for the index verb n-u ‘be

[B06.038.05:20]In (119), a complex construction is given where an NP headed by the noun he-kalieta
‘old person’ combines with the noun Kafola that expresses the possessor of the noun
kalieta ‘old person’ referring to the area where the old person comes from. It precedes
the NP and is linked with ba (LNK). The NP contains an embedded relative clause
marked with curly brackets. The evidence that this relative clause is embedded comes
from the position of the numeral nuku ‘one’, which follows the relative clause but
quantifies the noun kalieta ‘old person’. The relative clause he-tafaa do ayoku fala mi-a
‘his two drums are in the house’ is not linked to the head kalieta ‘old person’ with the
linker ba (LNK) as expected. One possibility is that it is omitted in the fast speech (this is
a fragment of a conversation); another possibility is that the possessive prefix he(3II.AL) that links the noun tafaa ‘drum’ to the possessor kalieta ‘old person’ is
sufficient.

[B06.041.10:49]In (120), the relative clause el adat he-ì is linked with ba (LNK) to the NP nala nu ‘those
things’. The relative clause precedes the NP because it expresses a possessor. The verb ì
‘put’ is often used in Abui to express possession (see also 8.4.2.7).

‘you should agree on those!’[B13.012.38:14]However, when the possessor expressed in the relative clause is inanimate, the relative
clause is not fronted. This is illustrated in (121), where the relative clause mi=ng tanga
he-ì do follows the NP nala ‘something’. This structure describes a mobile phone as a
thing that one uses for speaking (with other people).

‘Simon looked at the mobile phone and he did not understand it’[B10.048.02]The examples (116)-(121) suggest that the location of the modifiers linked with ba
(LNK) with respect of the NP sometimes follows the NP template. Modifiers that
denote spatial position or possessor may precede the NP linked to them with ba (LNK).
Although semantically, the NP functions as the head of the structure, the headedness of
structures with ba (LNK) is problematic on the syntactic level, because the relative clause
or other linked modifier appears in two positions.
Den Dikken (2006) presents an interesting cross-linguistic account of similar
structures that contain a linker and argues that it is actually the linker that is the ‘head’
of these structures. The other functions of ba seem to support this analysis (see 3.5.6).
The linker ba (LNK) probably originates in the verb ba ‘say’ that is grammaticalized to
an affirmative marker (6.4.2.1). The form ba is sometimes used as a copula, as
illustrated in (122). In (a), ba occurs as final constituent and serves as an optional
copula. Because the NP complement kaai ‘dog’ of the copula clause is itself a verb (the
stative verb kika ‘be red’) a copula is not necessary. However, the linking function of ba
is contrasted in (b), where it is grammaticalized to a relator glossed here as (LNK).

there is no copula that links the nominal predicate with its argument. An example ofNOUNS AND NOUN PHRASES175nominal predication is given in (123). In (a), the bare NP kalieta ‘old person’ serves as
nominal predicate. In (b), the NP moku fila ‘small child’ predicates over Fan Malei.

‘Fan Malei (is) a small child’In (124), the nominal predicates express names of objects or people.

‘there is one drum, its name is Mai Awen’b. [na-ne]NP[B06.041.09:00][Fani]NP1SG.INAL-name

‘my name is Fani’In (125), the NP upi nuku ‘one fruit’ is used in an equative sentence to quantify the NP
fu do ‘the betel nut’:

‘in the basket, there is just one betel nut’[upi nuku]NP
fruitone[T004.02:12]The nominal predicates that express kind are linked with their argument by index verbs.
This is illustrated in (126) where the index verb n-u ‘be like.PRX’ links the nominal
predicate with the NP Simon ayoku ‘two Simons’. The construction is contrasted with
nominal predicative construction in (b).
(126) a. Simon

‘the two Simons are friends’[B04.033.03]In (127), a similar construction is given where the nominal predicate is replaced by the
question word nala ‘what’. Note that the question word nala ‘what’ is in-situ.

[Note.005.01]While the index verb n-u ‘be like.PRX’ typically occurs between the arguments, the
index verb wi-d- ‘be like.MD’ usually follows both NPs. This is illustrated in (128),176CHAPTER IVwhere the NPs Jakarta do ‘Jakarta’ and Takalelang fila ‘small Takalelang’ precede the
verb wi-d- ‘become like that’.
(128) [Jakarta

3II.AL-placebe.youngwi-d-a
be.like.MD.CPL-hold-DUR
‘Jakarta is now like small Takalelang’[Mail.2006.11.01]As illustrated in (129), the place of origin of a person is usually expressed with a
nominal predicate in which the place of origin is expressed as a possessor. Here it is the
NP Takalelang he-ama kang ‘Takalelang people’.
(129) ni
[Takalelang he-ama
kang]NP
1PL.E place
3II.AL-person be.good
‘we are people of Takalelang’[B07.027.05]Nominal predicates may combine with the marker ba. As illustrated in (130), the
marker ba follows a fronted NP that serves as a nominal predicate expressing the topic.
Typically it is followed by an intonational pause, marked here with a comma.
(130) [sameng]TOP ba, Pak Kas di mi ba

say Mr. name 3A take LNK place
come.up.CPL-PFV MD
‘as for the cement, Mr. Karsten brought it up to Takpala (some time ago)’ [Sms.01.03]The form ba is glossed as ‘say’; it occurs in the verbal domain as affirmative marker (see
6.4.2.1) and may introduce conditional clauses. In (131), two constructions are given
that refer to kind. The NPs neng loku ‘men’ and mayol loku ‘women’ are the
arguments of the verb ba ‘say’. The verb ba ‘say’ marks the NPs as the topic for the
index verb n-u ‘be like.PRX’ which is co-indexed with the LOC prefix he- (3II.LOC). The
second argument of the index verb n-u ‘be like.PRX’ is expressed by a complement
clause that follows.

In this chapter, I discuss Abui argument realization. Event participants are realized as
different arguments of a verb with NPs and/or pronouns. The choice of the
appropriate realization is determined by the semantic properties of the participant. This
is discussed in section 5.1. The controlling and volitional participants are identified for
the actor (A) macrorole and realized as NPs and/or free pronouns. The affected
participants are identified for the undergoer (U) macrorole and realized as NPs and/or
bound pronouns. The listed criteria apply to arguments in both transitive and
intransitive constructions.
The choice between a pronoun and an NP is determined by the referential
properties of the participant. In section 5.2, I show that arguments with a specific
reference are expressed with pronouns and optional NPs; arguments with a nonspecific reference are expressed with NPs. In section 5.3, I discuss the A arguments
that are expressed with free pronouns. In section 5.4, the U arguments expressed with
bound pronouns are described. There are three distinct sets of bound pronouns that
may express the U arguments. As discussed in section 5.5, the choice of a bound
pronoun is determined by the semantic properties of the participants such as
[±individuated] and [±change of state]. In section 5.6, I focus on the U argument in
transitive constructions. I illustrate multiple ways in which the U argument can be
expressed. In section 5.7, the argument realization in intransitive constructions is
discussed. The single participant of the intransitive verb may be realized as the A or U
argument. In section 5.8, I present a diachronic analysis of the bound pronouns.
Finally, in section 5.9 an overview of the argument realization is given.","[192, 193, 194, 195, 196, 197, 198, 199, 200]"

This book is a description of Abui, a Papuan language spoken on Alor Island in eastern
Indonesia. It presents essential parts of Abui grammar in a theoretically neutral way.
This chapter contains some general information about Abui, its speakers and the
area in which Abui is spoken. This chapter is organised in the following fashion. The
geographic position of the area where Abui is spoken is defined in section 1.1. The
genetic affiliation of Abui, together with a brief overview of the historical sources
concerning Alor Island and Abui people, is discussed in section 1.2. In section 1.3 I
give some general information about the Abui community, the number of speakers,
their typical occupation and way of living. The linguistic situation of the area where
Abui is spoken is described in section 1.4. Information about the contexts in which
Abui is used and about language endangerment will also be included in this section. In
section 1.5 I give an overview of previous linguistic efforts focused on Abui; and in 1.6
I discuss Abui genetic affiliation. I present a typological sketch of Abui in section 1.7.
Section 1.8 discusses how the language data was collected. It describes the fieldwork
and gives some basic information about the language consultants. Section 1.9 deals with
composition of the corpus and gives a list of recorded texts that are included in it.
Section 1.10 gives an outline of this book and introduces the conventions in which the
language data will be presented.","[9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24]"
"3.5.6Conjunction markersIn Abui, there are a small number of forms that serve as conjunction markers such as
ba (LNK), ya (SEQ), e ‘and’, and re ‘or’. The coordination marker e ‘and’ occurs only in
the nominal domain. As illustrated in (168), the marker e ‘and’ may combine with
nouns referring to humans and inanimate referents.

‘axes, swords and red whetstones’kika
be.redIn coordinating constructions, at least two nouns are conjoined by a conjunction
marker or simply listed with an intonational pause after each of the constituents.
Coordinating constructions must be distinguished from list compounds (see section126CHAPTER III4.3.3). The order of constituents in a list compound is lexicalized, while in case of
coordinating construction this is not the case.
The conjunction markers ba (LNK), ya (SEQ), and re ‘or’ may be used in both the
nominal and the verbal domain. The linker ba (LNK) joins two constituents so that they
have shared reference to a single referent or event. I refer to this linker as ‘intersective’.
The intersective linker ba (LNK) may be used in nominal domain to link an NP to other
constituents (relative clauses, numerals, deictics, other NPs) that serve as adnominal
modifiers. In (169), the intersective linker ba (LNK) links the head noun kaai ‘dog’ with
the modifier NP he-bikeng faring ‘his many lice’. The complex NP serves as the A
argument of the verb kafia ‘scrape, scratch’ and it is co-indexed with the prefix do(3I.REC).
(169) [kaai]NP ba
{he-bikeng faring}NP oro do-kafi-a

LNK 3II.AL-louse many
DST 3I.REC-scrape-DUR
‘that dog with many lice is scratching (itself) over there’[B05.060.02]In section 4.5, I discuss other structures that are linked with the intersective linker ba
(LNK) to an NP. In the verbal domain, ba (LNK) links two verbs as in (170) the verbs
bang ‘carry’ and yaa ‘go’. The events of ‘carrying’ and ‘going’ refer to a complex event
‘carry towards’.
(170) tafaa di bang ba
yaa
drum 3A carry LNK go
‘he carried drums to the village’melangmi-a-d-ivillagebe.in-be.at-hold-PFV
[B02.118.07:50]The linked verbs form a tight unit that falls under the scope of a negation. This
type of construction is different from serial verb constructions, which are defined as a
verb clusters without any conjunction markers (see 8.1). The use of ba (LNK) in the
verbal domain will not be further analysed in the current description.
The intersective linker ba (LNK) contrasts with the non-intersective linker ya
glossed as SEQ(uential). ya (SEQ) indicates a non-intersective union of two constituents
(a sequence of phrases or clauses). It may be used in both nominal and verbal domain.
In the nominal domain, ya (SEQ) links two NPs. This is illustrated in (171), where two
NPs are linked. Recall (169), to see the contrast with ba (LNK) that can not serve as a
coordinating conjunction marker.

[B05.008.06]GRAMMATICAL CATEGORIES127In the verbal domain, ya (SEQ) links verbs that retain their own reference so that the
construction is read as a sequence of events. Example (170) is contrasted with example
(172) below. In (172), the verbs bang ‘carry’ and yaa ‘go’ do not refer to a single event
because the ‘carrying’ preceded the ‘going’.

‘he carried drums and (then) went to the village’In (173), a more complex example is given, where the non-intersective linker ya (SEQ)
marks that the verbs we ‘leave’, tahai ‘search’ and marang ‘go up’ describe successive
events.

[B06.078.00:37]The linker re ‘or’ indicates a disjoint set of constituents. It is often used in alternative
questions, in which two or more possible answers are presented. It is used in both the
nominal and the verbal domain as illustrated in (174).

ding kang ‘probably’
The predicate ding kang indicates that an event might possibly occur. In fact the ding
kang consists of free pronoun di (3A) combines with the generic verb ng ‘see’ that
forms a SVC with kang ‘be good’ as illustrated in :
(194) [di=ng kang]adverbial ne-kariang do
he-ahama

be.good
1SG.AL-work PRX 3II.AL-remnant PRX lie.on-PFV
‘probably my work will be left unfinished’, lit. ‘it could be that the remainder of my work
will remain’
[B07.037.02]The adverbial ding kang possibly originates in a SVC with kang ‘be good’ discussed in
8.4.7.2. It occurs in the clause-initial position and is followed by adverbs and
arguments. It seems plausible to argue that in contexts as (195) the adverbial predicate
ding kang has been lexicalized to an adverb with meaning ‘probably’:
(195) [ding kang]adverbial anui ko
sei
probably
rain soon come.down.CNT
‘probably it will rain’[B07.039.01]6.3.3.6
akun ‘be dark’
The completive verb akun ‘be dark’ indicates the location of an event after some period
of darkness. In (196), an adverbial phrase containing akun ‘be dark’ occurs between the
A argument of the clause and the VP we ‘leave’. The phrase consists of the verb mi ‘be
in’ that refers to a location the darkness, and serves as a complement clause of the
generic verb ng ‘see’. The generic verb ng ‘see’ combines with the completive stem
akun ‘be dark’ in allative serial verb construction (see 8.4.2.1). The adverbial phrase
mi=ng akun could be literally translated as ‘darkened into (it)’.
(196) a
[mi=ng akun]adverbial phrase

[B04.077.01]In (197), akun ‘dark’ combines with the deictic verb la ‘be.MD’ and generic verb ng
‘see’ to refer the time after a previous period of darkness, which is ‘this morning’. It
combines with the verb maran ‘come up’. As in the previous example, the deictic verb
la ‘be.MD’ serves as a complement of the verb ng ‘see’ which combines in allative serial
construction with the verb akun ‘be dark’.

[B07.004.01]274CHAPTER VIIn (198), the verb akun ‘be dark’ is incorporated in a complex verb headed by the verb
d ‘hold, get’. It combines with two aspectual markers and precedes the modified VP hokariang ‘work for him’ and its argument na ‘1SG’.

[B07.006.01]The completive stem akun of the verb ‘be dark’ alternates with the stem akung that
refers to an ongoing event of being dark. The completive stem refers to an event of
‘being dark’ that has a final point an can be interpreted as a ‘morning’ or a ‘day’.
6.3.3.7
afe ‘pass’
The adverbial modifier afe ‘pass’ indicates an event that occurred in unspecified past. It
occurs in the left-edge of a relative clause preceding the verb luk ‘rub’, as illustrated in
(199). The adverb wan ‘already’ is a part of the main clause.

[B10.046.07]In (200), afe ‘pass’ combines in a possessive construction with the NP tung ayoku ‘two
years’ to refer to an event that occurred two years ago, suggesting that afe ‘pass’ serves
here as a nominal that can be translated as ‘past’.

[B07.004.03]In (201), I list a number of adverbial modifiers that contain afe ‘pass’; they occur in
contexts similar to (200). Note that afe ‘pass’ precedes the nouns tung ‘year’ in (b) and
war ‘sun’ in (c). It is located in the same position as deictic demonstratives in the NP
and its function is related to that of deictic demonstratives in the sense that it indicates
the location of a period in time. This is not surprising, because Abui NP structure and
VP structure are largely parallel.

‘very long time ago’In a number of cases, afe ‘pass’ is part of a complex verb afe-i-d- ‘get passed’. The verb
combines sometimes with a single argument war ‘sun’ to refer to either ‘evening’ or
‘yesterday’. It use is illustrated in (202) and (203).

Combinations of adverbial modifiers
There is a preference for a clause to contain maximally one adverbial modifier.
However, in a number of cases, a single clause contains two adverbial modifiers as
illustrated in the following examples. In (204), the adverb yal combines with the adverb
wala ‘be so’:
(204) yal wala
di làk-i

3A leave.for-PFV
‘he has left just now’[B07.005.01]In (205), the adverbial yal ‘now’ precedes the nominal predicate war do ‘this day, today’
in a part of the Lord’s Prayer.

Talking about time
The clause nala h-uor ‘strike something’ is used to refer to time measured in hours; it
corresponds to English ‘o’clock’. In declarative constructions this clause is followed by
a numeral indicating how many times the ‘beating’ occurred. In questions, the complex
verb yen-r- ‘be how many’ is in situ position of the questioned numeral.

‘while she is plaiting mats (mat-plaiting) she tells a story’[B07.035.04]The complex VPs in (101)-(103) suggest that the incorporated U argument has to be
non-specific. It is located in the VP in the PREFIX.1 slot and only one additional
argument is allowed, which is expressed with the REC prefix. The structure of a VP with
an incorporated argument is given in (104).

INCORPORATED.ARGUMENTAs discussed in section 5.2, only [+specific] participants are realized with a pronoun in
Abui. However, the example (105) shows that the incorporated U argument may be
realized by both prefix and NP. The REC prefix ho- (3II.REC) is attached in front of the
NP. It refers to the human participant that is opened the door for. This construction is
a subtype of the UREC-UPAT transitive construction (see 6.2.3.8).

‘(they) opened him the door so he came down; and the fire, (they) gave it to him’The verb stem liel ‘lift’ is bound and requires obligatorily a prefix. An argument can be
incorporated only when the prefix is present. The structure of second type of argument
incorporation is schematically illustrated in (106).
(106) {PREFIX.2-[PREFIX.1-BOUND.VERB.STEM]V}VPINCORPORATED.ARGUMENTIn all presented cases, the incorporated argument was preceded either by a REC or LOC
prefix. In case of bound verb stems, this argument was co-indexed with the PAT prefix.
This suggests that only the arguments with semantic role of patient or theme may be
incorporated.
Abui PAT and LOC prefixes are polysemous; they also mark possessor. Instances
such as (107) are not analyzed as argument incorporation, because the possessive
function is also available and less complex than argument incorporation. Observe, that
the prefix de- that is attached to the NP kuya ‘bird’ expresses the possessor. However,
because of the benefactive-possessive polysemy found in Abui (cf. Lichtenberk, 2002;
Margetts, 2004), this construction has a benefactive reading.","[261, 262]"
"2.2.1Distribution of consonantsThe following overview of the phonotactic distribution of Abui consonants takes into
account their occurrence in (i) syllables: either in syllable onset or coda; and in (ii)
words: either in word-initial, word-medial or word-final position:

endocentric. As for the compound ruwol ata ‘chicken nest’, in Alor, chicken usually
nest in mango trees standing in the vicinity of a house. The head ata ‘leaf’ can be taken
quite literally as the nest location of a chicken. As for the compound mutang kadielang
‘bee stipel’, bee hives are usually found high in the trees, attached under a branch. In
that sense, they resemble the stipel of a plant.

Nominalized Verb Phrases
In Abui, there are verb phrases that are used non-predicatively. These verb phrases are
nominalised and possibly lexicalized; they combine with adnominal modifiers (mainly
anaphoric demonstratives) and serve to express arguments. As discussed in section
3.2.2, many lexical items in Abui are categorically indetermined and can be used
predicatively and referentially. The ambiguity is usually resolved by the syntactic context
in which the item is inserted. The presence of a quantifier or anaphoric demonstrativeNOUNS AND NOUN PHRASES153typically indicates a nominal structure. However, also a number of verb phrases are
nominalised and used referentially, as illustrated in (56). They indicate spatial or
temporal locations that are specified by the first constituent. The final constituent of
these forms is always a verb. The first constituent is either a noun, expressing an
argument of the head verb, or another verb.

‘two main beams of the house supported by vertical poles with mouth-like endings’In (57), a number of species are grouped according to their typical habitat. The habitat
(a ‘location’) that expressed with an NP is the U argument of the verb ì ‘put’; it is
referred to by the prefix he- (3II.LOC). Observe that the first constituent is a noun (tei
‘field’, mang ‘possession’, or an NP (ahiling tama ‘air’), or another nominalised VP
(tama wal ‘ocean’).

‘carry’.
(63)da-wabang3I.INAL-mouth

‘gossip, scandalmonger’Nominalised VPs such as dawa bang (lit.: ‘carry his mouth’) probably originate in
relative clauses. In (64), a complex NP is used to refer to a ‘tailor’. The noun ama
‘person’ is the head of the NP and combines with a relative clause given in the brackets.
It is followed by the noun adua ‘master, boss’ in a possessive-like construction.","[173, 174, 175, 176, 177]"
"4.2.1Possessive prefixesPossessive prefixes express possessors. They are attached to a nominal root that
denotes the possessum. First and second person possessors are only expressed as
bound pronouns. Third person possessors are expressed as bound pronouns and
optionally as NPs. The Abui pronominal prefix inventory consists of three sets (see
section 3.3.2). In possessive constructions, only prefixes from sets I and III are
employed; they are listed in Table 17. As discussed in 3.3.2, sets I and III also combine
with verbal roots. Pronominal prefixes from set III express PATIENT arguments and
possessors of body parts. The formal parallel is based on the semantic parallel between
inalienable possession and PATIENT arguments. Both inalienably possessed items and
PAT(ient) arguments are under full control of the POSSESSOR and ACTOR respectively. The
nouns denoting body parts are bound roots that require possessive inflection: they are
inherently possessed. The pronominal prefixes from set III are glossed as INAL
(INALIENABLE) when they combine with nouns. Pronominal prefixes from set I indicate
LOC(ation) undergoer arguments and combine with free nominal roots to index the
possessor. They are glossed as AL (ALIENABLE).

(Haan 2001), Blagar (Steinhauer, p.c.) or Kui and Tanglapui (Nichols and Bickel 2005). Obligatory possessive

distinguished from the form ba-i that follows the predicate and consists of the verb ba
‘say’ which is inflected for perfective aspect. In (179), two instances are given where bai follows the predicate. In (a) it serves as confirmative marker (see 6.4.2.2); while in (b)
it introduces a conditional clause.

[B07.079.01]Deictic demonstrativesAs adverbial modifiers, deictic demonstratives indicate the location of an event in
space. As discussed in 3.5.2, demonstratives may occur in both the nominal domain and
the verbal domain. In both domains, demonstratives may occur in two syntactic
positions. They either precede or follow the head. In a clause, deictic demonstratives
precede the VP, the anaphoric demonstratives follow it. When the demonstrative
precedes the head verb of a VP, it refers to the location of the event. When it follows
the head verb, it locates the event expressed by the VP in discourse (see also 4.4.3).
In the following examples, I illustrate the use of the deictic demonstratives as adverbial
modifiers. In (180), the deictic demonstrative do (PRX) locates the event ‘here’ by the
speaker.

[B02.033.08:28]6.3.3Predicates functioning as adverbial modifiersThere are a number of predicates (both nominal and verbal) that are used as adverbial
modifiers. These modifiers normally precede the arguments and can be treated as
independent predicates.13 In some cases, they are preceded by one of the arguments.
This is illustrated in (185). The adverbial modifier akun ‘be dark’ is found between the
VP làk ‘leave for’ and its argument ama nu ‘somebody’ in (a). In (b), the verb akun ‘be
dark’ precedes. In that case it is ambiguous and can be treated as a separate clause.

compose the notion of ‘tomorrow morning’; they are literally translated as ‘(it) was
dark, (it) became bright’ and describe the temporal setting of the event of roasting corn.
13Stokhof (1984:139) states that ‘usually time phrases precede the subject’.","[291, 292, 293]"

phonological form is given in the left-hand column, the orthographic representation in
the second column, the used gloss in the third column. The right-hand column gives a
number of possible interpretations that generic verbs may have in context. Note that
Abui generic roots are divided into two subsets, according to their valence properties.
The [±transitive] roots are given in the upper part of the table; the [−transitive] roots
are given in the lower part of the table. The [±transitive] roots are either consonants or

roots share the same semantic core and have a similar place of articulation. They can be
phonologically characterized as alveodental liquids (l, r), non-labial nasals (n, ng), and
unvoiced alveodental obstruents (t, s). The alternation reflects the internal temporal
structure of the referred event (inner aspect, Aktionsart). An event referred to with the
single semantic core is viewed either as having an endpoint (completive), or an initial100CHAPTER IIIpoint (inceptive).8 In (85) the alternation of the generic verbs l ‘give’ and r ‘reach’ is
illustrated.

‘Fani gave me a certain book, books’Generic roots have a number of grammatical functions in Abui. Their first
function is that of a predicate in a monoverbal clause. This is illustrated in (86), where
the generic root ì ‘put’ is used as the main predicate of the clause bataa do ì ‘the wood
is put (down)’.

[B02.057.22:55]The generic roots combine with pronominal prefixes and aspectual suffixes, as other
verbal roots. This is illustrated in (87), where the root ì ‘put’ combines with the prefix
no- (1SG.REC) and with durative suffix -a (DUR). It shares the A argument ama ba nala
kapuk adua ‘tailor’ with the verb mi ‘take’ in the first clause.

[B10.051.06]The generic roots occur frequently in serial verb constructions. An example of
the root ì ‘put’ used in a serial verb construction is given in (88). It is serialized with
three verbs. The first one is the verb mi ‘take’ that combines with the U argument sura
‘book’. The second one is the position verb tai/tah- ‘put on’, which combines with the
U argument meja ‘table’. The third one is the generic root ng ‘see’ that encodes the
direction towards the table.

[B07.034.06]The glosses of the generic roots l/r and ng/n stresses the distinction [±completive], while the gloss of s/t
stresses the distinction [±inceptive]. The glossing is somewhat misleading because it does not specify the
aspectual properties of the [−completive] and [−inceptive] roots. In fact, the roots t/s can be glossed as s ‘lie
down’ and t ‘lie down.CPL’ to match the alternation [±completive] used for the roots l/r and ng/n. I decided
not to use these glosses because they are too large to gloss a monosegmental root.
8GRAMMATICAL CATEGORIES101In serial verb constructions, the generic roots often serve to realize and mark certain
types of participants such as benefactives, recipients, or instruments. In (89), the root ì
‘put’ is serialized with the motion verb we ‘leave’. Consider the situation where the
speaker is about to leave because it is getting late and he should have left before. In
those cases the construction given below can be used. The speaker refers to the
necessity of his departure. It is encoded as ‘put’ on him that he should leave. In such a
case, the root ì ‘put’ has a modal reading.
(89)ne-ìwe1SG.LOC-put leave
‘I have to leave’[B05.045.04]Serial verb constructions with generic roots such as those in (88) and (89) are discussed
in detail in chapter 8, in particular in section 8.4.2.
Evidence of the verbhood of the generic verb a ‘be at’ is provided in (90). The
verb a ‘be at’ combines with the distributive prefix to- (DISTR.REC) and is serialized with
the verb mit-i ‘sit’.

‘her parents are still alive’, lit.: ‘her mother and father, they sit together’ [B01.083.02:57]The generic verb a ‘be at’ is related to the durative suffix -a (DUR) and derives many
stative verbs from bound verbal roots (see 7.2.1).
The generic verb d ‘hold’ can be used as a single predicate as in (91). The verb d
‘hold, get’, or here ‘acquire’, combines with the perfect suffix -u (PRF).

aspectual inflection, to satisfy phonological constrains.

poles and in order to enter a house, one has to use a ladder.

with the PAT prefix ha- (3II.PAT). The A argument na (1SG) is shared.
(96)namifeha-k1SG fodder take

[B06.025.05]Generic verbs combine with other roots to derive complex verbs (CVs). A
simple example is given in (97), where the generic roots ì ‘put’ and r ‘reach’ derive
complex verbs from the adjective root kul ‘white’ (see 3.5.1).

Deictic verbs
Deictic verbs point to locations. There are five monosylabic deictic stems that are
identified as verbs, because they may combine with aspectual inflection. The aspectual
suffix -i (PFV) identifies the form ma ‘be.PRX’ in (98) as a verb. The verb ma ‘be.PRX’GRAMMATICAL CATEGORIES103occurs in serial verb construction with the verb -rik ‘hurt, be ill’. It indicates that the
event expressed by the verb -rik ‘hurt, be ill’ indeed occurred. It is followed by an
intonational break marked here with a comma. Together with the first clause it serves
as a complement of the verb uk-d-a and it is co-indexed with the LOC prefix he(3II.LOC).

‘it surprises me that you are pulling the bow and (it) already hurts you’ [B09.004.04:03]However, deictic verbs mostly occur in serial verb constructions, and only in few cases
they are inflected for aspect or person. This makes them very adverb-like elements, also
due to their semantics.
The deictic verbs point to locations with respect to the speech participants. In
this respect, they are closely related to demonstratives discussed in 3.5.2. The reference
points anchoring the deictic centre are located in speech participants. For SPEAKER
BASED DEICTIC VERBS, as the name suggests, the reference point of the deictic centre is
based at the speaker. For ADDRESSEE BASED DEICTIC VERBS, the reference point of the
deictic centre is based at the addressee. Once the deictic centre is established a threeway distinction can be made along the contrast PROXIMAL/MEDIAL/DISTAL. For the
distal locations, the distinction between the speaker based and addressee based deictic
verbs is not relevant. An overview of the deictic verbs is given in (99):
SPEAKER-BASED

be.PRX.AD
‘be with you’d. fa
be.MD.AD
‘be further from you’e. ya
be.DST
‘be far from me/you/DC’The deictic verbs ma ‘be.PRX’ and ta ‘be.PRX.AD’ in (99) express proximity to the deictic
centre, located at one of the speech participants. Both verbs can be translated as ‘be
here’ but the interpretation of ‘here’ depends on the location of the deictic centre at the
speaker or at the addressee. The deictic verbs la ‘be.MD’ and fa ‘be.MD.AD’ express a
medial distance from the deictic centre, located at the speaker or addressee. The deictic
verb ya ‘be.DST’ expresses remoteness and distance from the deictic centre.
Deictic verbs always occur in intransitive constructions. In most cases, they
combine with other verbs in serial verb constructions. They serve as minor verbs
expressing the location (or modality) of the referred event. This is illustrated in (100), in104CHAPTER IIIa situation where the speaker inquires whether the addressee intends to stay the night in
the harbour or come back to the village. The verb la ‘be.MD’ refers to the location of
‘sleeping’, which is in the ‘harbour’, that is less proximate to the speech participants at
the moment of speaking.

a similar serial construction. Each of the deictic verbs is serialized with the verb sei
‘come down’. It indicates the position of the speech participant:

3.4.5.4
Positional verbs
Positional verbs are items that express the position of two participants in a similar way
as prepositions/postpositions in other languages. In Abui, these items are identified as
verbs by two properties: (i) they may combine with one or two pronominal prefixes,
and (ii) they display stem alternation. An overview of positional verbs is given in (102).

prefixes to co-index its two U arguments.","[121, 122, 123, 124, 125, 126, 127]"
"INTRODUCTION11As in other Papuan languages, Abui has a small class of verbs (referred to as
generic verbs in this study) that derive new verbs. This is a feature specific of Papuan
languages (cf. Foley, 2000:386). Generic verbs also frequently combine with other
verbs, and then function as auxiliaries. Abui has no ditransitive verbs and most verbs
may occur in both transitive and intransitive construction. These features are common
among Papuan languages (cf. Foley, 2000:376-7).

no adpositions (instead, serial verb constructions are used)
anaphoric demonstratives follow the noun

frequent clause chaining without conjunctionsEvaluation: Abui shows clause chaining and tail-head linkage, which are both
commonly found among Papuan languages. It is also very rich in serial verb
constructions. Switch reference, sometimes found in TNG languages (cf. Foley,
2000:384), is not found in Abui. In sum, Abui has many features that are typically
Papuan, but also shares some features with the Austronesian languages of Eastern
Indonesia. There is a possibility that Papuan languages of Alor-Pantar predated the
Austronesian languages (cf. Pawley, 2005-b:100). In that case, it is expected that there
has been diffusion of features from Austronesian to Papuan and vice versa (cf. Klamer
et.al., In press).","[33, 34]"
"8COMPLEX VERBS7.2.3313Heterogeneous complex verbs with nominal rootsThere is a group of CVs that consist of a free nominal root combined with a generic
verb root. This group is relatively small as illustrated in (48) and (51).9 The nominal
roots combine with the generic root l ‘give’. The derived verbs refer to events during
which an undergoer is affected in the way described by the noun. The nominal root
wayang ‘paddle n., row n.’ combines with the generic root d ‘hold, get’ to refer the
event that contains an actor participant. In this case the correspondence is with the
activity of ‘paddling’ or ‘rowing’ in quite literal; it is described as ‘holding’ of a ‘paddle’,
cf. English ‘to row’, ‘to paddle’. The nominal root -wa ‘mouth’ is bound. It may
combine with the generic root ng ‘see’ to refer to an event that contains an undergoer
participant (experiencer); it refers to ‘greeting’.

pronominal prefixes. The REC prefix no- (1SG.REC) expresses the recipient of greeting,
the PAT distributive prefix encodes the reciprocity of greeting. In (b), the nominal use
of the root -wa ‘mouth’ is illustrated. Note that the noun -wa ‘mouth’ is obligatorily
possessed.
9 In other Papuan languages such as Kalam (Pawley, 2004), Kobon (Davies, 1984:201), or Enga (Lang, 1975),
the derivation of complex verbs with nominal roots is more productive.","[335, 336]"

"5.8Development of Abui bound pronounsAbui pronouns seem to be cognate to the pronominal forms found in other Papuan
languages of Alor-Pantar area. The formal relation goes even further to the mainland
languages of the Trans New Guinea family (TNG), cf. section 1.6. The reconstructed
proto-TNG forms *na and *ka (Foley, 2000) are found in 1st and 2nd singular
respectively and in 1st plural. The velar proto-TNG root [k] indicating second person is
possibly related to Abui glottal [ʔ] that characterizes second person singular. In Papuan
languages, the singular vs. plural number is indicated by the vowel alternation *a ~*i
(cf. Foley, 2000:362; Ross, 2006:29); in Abui, this alternation is found as well. In (Ross
2005), a reconstructed inclusive suffix *-p is given. It is possible that this form is also
the source of Abui inclusive forms pi (1PL.I), po-/pu- (1PL U arguments), and pi- (1PL U
arguments and possessors).
There is cross-linguistic evidence that diachronically the pronouns were
morphologically complex. The consonant roots identify the person while the vowel
roots mark the number (cf. Foley, 2000:362). In Abui these basic composed
pronominal forms fused later with the generic verbs *a ‘be at’, *e ‘add, continue’, and *o
‘point’ (cf. Klamer and Kratochvíl 2006). In (60), I illustrate the development for206CHAPTER Vsingular bound pronouns. In all given cases, the vowel root [ɑ] that codes the singular
number was deleted. The pronominal form and the generic verb fused into a single
morpheme and became grammaticalized as prefixes.5

preserved. In (b), the high vowel fused with the lower vowel and was preserved. The
resulting prefix has the same form as the PAT prefix. In (c), the high front vowel was
deleted resulting in the REC prefix ro-, or in other dialects ru-. The vowel alternation
seems to reflect the diachronic development. In sum, (60) and (61) suggest that the
pronominal prefixes originate from a serial verb construction. Although this might
seem unlikely at the first sight, there are other serial constructions reminiscent of these
proposed constructions (see 8.4.2). The possessive prefixes developed along the same
path as shown in (62).

"5.5.2U arguments expressed as RECAs illustrated in (26), the bound pronoun labelled as REC (RECIPIENT) expresses or coindexes the U argument identified for the semantic role of recipient. In most cases,
arguments expressed with REC bound pronouns have human/animate referents, but
there are also cases when the REC bound pronoun refers to an inanimate goal. The
arguments expressed with REC bound pronouns can be identified by the features
[+specific] and [+individuated]. The feature [+individuated] encodes that the referents
are directly involved and affected by the event. The referents are typically animate orARGUMENT REALIZATION189inanimate discrete objects are that are clearly activated in the context (cf. Gentner and

[B05.065.02]6.1.2Person inflection and valenceIn Abui, the head of a VP may carry person inflection in addition to aspectual inflection
discussed in 6.1.1. Person inflection appears in the form of pronominal prefixes (see
3.3.2). Syntactically, these prefixes are (anaphoric) pronouns that express [+specific]
arguments (see 5.2). Abui verbs appear in a number of transitive and intransitive
constructions. Almost no Abui verb is restricted to a single construction but most verb
stems can be characterized as ‘labile’ (see 6.2.1). Except for the intransitive stative
verbs, most Abui verbs appear with one or two arguments. In my corpus, there are no
instances of ditransitive verbs; in description of events involving three participants
various types of serial verb constructions are used instead (see 8.4.2).
In this section, I illustrate on a sample of verbs that a verb stem may occur in
transitive, intransitive, and experiencer construction. I discuss the verbs following their
morphological type: (i) free stems that may occur as a VP; (ii) bound stems that
obligatorily carry person inflection (see also 3.4.2.2). Both types are discussed in
sections 6.1.2.1 and 6.1.2.2 respectively.
6.1.2.1
Person inflection and valence of free verb stems
In this section, I illustrate the variation in person inflection and valence on a sample of
free verb stems (stems that may occur without person inflection). The verbs mit ‘sit’,
yaa ‘go’, mong ‘die’, kil ‘detach’, paneng ‘make’, and marang ‘come up’ represent
various semantic verb classes discussed in 3.4.4.
In examples (52)-(54), I illustrate that the verb mit ‘sit’ can occur as free stem
and also with various types of prefixes. In (52), three instances are given. In (a), the VP
combines with the free pronoun na (1SG) in an intransitive construction (see 6.2.4). In
(b), the VP consist of the head combined with the REC pronominal prefix no- (1SG.REC),
while in (c), a similar case is given for the third person. In (b, c), the verb mit ‘sit’ is
used in a A≡UREC experiencer construction (see 6.2.5.1) and has a reading of
unintentionally performed event.

‘purpose’ of taking which is ‘sewing up’. In (125) a similar example is given:

[B07.014.02]The verb mi ‘take’ combines with the A argument ni (1PL.E) that is shared with buuk
‘consume’. Both verbs combine in a symmetrical SVC. The minor verb ng ‘see’
encodes the purpose forming a prosodic word with mi. The verb mi ‘take’ combines
with the U argument yambuk nu ‘some glasses’ expressed in the first clause. The SVC
numi wea ‘we want’ is discussed in detail below.
INTERIOR LOCATION SERIAL CONSTRUCTION. The second function of the minor
verb m ‘be in’ is to express the interior location of either an animate or inanimate
participant. I will first discuss constructions where the verb m ‘be in’ serves to express
interior location of an animate participant. In these constructions, the minor verb m ‘be
in’ combines with two U arguments. The human experiencer participant is realized as
the U argument of the verb m ‘be in’ with the REC prefix. It is typically shared with the
major verb (V2). An example of an interior location SVC is given in (126) where the
minor verb m ‘be in’ combines with the major verb pang ‘feel’ to refer to ‘thinking’ as
‘feeling inside’. The REC prefix o- (2SG.REC) expresses the recipient of the ‘thought’. The390CHAPTER VIIILOC prefix he- (3II.LOC) refers to the manner of ‘thinking’, in this case the two NPs ni-beka ni-tafiela ‘our sins, our wrong-doing’.(126) ni-beka

constructions with m/mi ‘be in’ further in this section.
There is a large variety of constructions with mi ‘be in’ that refer to various
emotions and cognitive events. These constructions can be described with a number of
templates. In (127), the template consists of the verb mi ‘be in’ that is serialized with
the major verb describing the emotion or cognitive event. The REC prefix expresses the
experiencer that is optionally expressed with an NP or with a free pronoun. Note that
the major verb may combine with a U argument.

Aspectual inflection
In Abui, verbs are forms that may carry aspectual inflection. This is a unique feature of
the verbal grammatical category. In (38), the verb làk ‘leave for’ combines with
perfective suffix -i (PFV) in (a). In (b), it combines with imperfective suffix -e (IPFV):

Person inflection
In Abui, verbs may carry person inflection (pronominal prefixes expressing the U
argument). As discussed in section 3.2.3, also nouns may combine with pronominal
prefixes from set I and III. Only prefixes from set II are used exclusively with verbs.
Any item that combines with a prefix from set II is automatically identified as a verb.
An example is given in (39). In (a), the verb làk ‘leave for’ combines with pronominal
prefix ho- (3II.REC) expressing the U argument of the verb together with the noun
Simon. The first person participant affects Simon by going away, and Simon is
identified as recipient (human goal) of going. The construction refers to a situation in
which Simon is stepped on by the speaker (see also 6.2.2.3). In (b), the verb làk ‘leave
for’ combines with the pronominal prefix no- (1SG.REC) expressing the U argument that
refers to the speaker. The construction has a ‘reflexive’ reading of ‘returning oneself’
because both pronominal forms are coreferential (see also 6.2.5.1).

A≡UPAT experiencer construction.

Verb stem alternation
Another morphological property unique of verbs is stem alternation.7 There are two
morphological types of stem alternation, listed in (41), which divided Abui verbs in
Verb stem alternation related to the inner aspect properties of referred events is found in other Papuan
languages (Foley 1986). For instance in Telefol and Kiwai two alternating stems refer to different events with7GRAMMATICAL CATEGORIES83three classes. This classification is used in the dictionary to indicate inflectional
properties of verb stems. The first class shows no alternation, it includes both native
and loan stems. The second class is characterized by an alternation affecting the coda of
the verb stem. This type of alternation is relatively productive and predictable. The
third class is characterized by an alternation affecting the entire rime (of the final
syllable). With exception of the productive type III.a (a ~ i), this alternation is not
predictable and is not productive. However, the verbs that show this irregular
alternation are verbs used with high frequency, such as mara ‘go up’. The verbs

"3.5.3QuantifiersQuantifiers (QUANT) are forms that express something about quantity of the element
that they combine with. Quantifiers combine with both nouns and verbs. In an NP,
quantifiers indicate the quantity of the referent. In a VP, quantifiers indicate the
temporal extension or frequency of an event. In Abui, there are two types of
quantifiers: (i) numerals, and (ii) non-numeral quantifiers. Numerals indicate exact
quantity; they are discussed in 3.5.3.1. Non-numeral quantifiers indicate approximate
quantity; they are discussed in 3.5.3.2.

roots combine with a number of generic roots.8 Note that the adjectival root kul ‘white’
has to combine with the generic root i ‘put’ or with r ‘reach’ if it is to function
predicatively. As in previous cases, the generic verb d ‘hold’ derives a verb referring to a
change of state achieved by the actor and usually affecting him. The verb r ‘reach’ refers
again to a change of state affecting an undergoer and usually brought about by an actor.
The generic verb ì/i ‘put’ typically derives an accomplishment verb where the
participant is in certain state, without focusing how the state was reached.

The members
of the first subgroup do not contain the final generic root a ‘be at’. The members of the
second subgroup end in the vowel /ɑ/. They are morphologically complex, consisting
of two bound roots. Roots expressing states or properties are bound. Unlike adjectives,
they may only be used as adnominal modifier with the generic root a ‘be at’. As
illustrated in (80), the bound roots fok- ‘big’ and lil- ‘hot’ obligatorily combine with
another bound root, belonging to the generic verb class.
(80)fok-a‘be big’big-be.atlil-a‘be hot’hot-be.atSemantically, the set of stative verbs that obligatorily contains the generic verb a ‘be at’
refers to properties such as size (big, small), colour (red, blue/green, bright), position
(near, far, high, deep), material density (fine-grained, soft), material condition
(hot/cold). However, the verbal roots given in (80) that combine with a ‘be at’ to refer
to states may also combine with other generic roots, such as d ‘hold’, or r ‘reach’ derive
other types of verbs as illustrated in (81), for more details see 7.2.1.
(81)fok-d-i
big-hold-PFV‘get big, grow up, increase’lil-r-i‘heat up’hot-reach-PFVThe class of stative verb is identified by its unique syntactic properties. Stative
verbs are found as heads in VPs and as adnominal modifiers in NPs. Stative verbs
overlap in their adnominal modifier function with adjectives (see 3.5.1). In (82), the use
of the stative verbs lila ‘be hot’ and fing ‘be eldest’ is contrasted. In (a), it is used in a
noun phrase. In (b), the verb lila ‘be hot’ is the head of a VP combining with an
argument realized with the NP ya do ‘this water’. In (c), lila ‘be hot’ combines with a U
argument, expressed with the prefix from set II no- (1SG.REC). Analogically, in (d) the
verb fing ‘be eldest’ serves as the adnominal modifier in the NP headed by moku ‘kid’.
In (e), fing predicates over the NP moku do ‘the kid’. Finally, in (f), fing combines with
the set II prefix do- (3I.REC).","[117, 118, 119, 120]"
"2386.1.4CHAPTER VIArgument incorporationAs discussed in the previous section, pronominal prefixes are attached to the verb stem;
no other constituent may intervene between them and the stem. This is illustrated in
(100), where the verb pun ‘grab’ combines with the pronominal form ho- (3II.REC). The
referent of the NP pingai ‘plate’ is [+specific], [+individuated], and [−change of state].6

verb. I analyze these constructions as involving an incorporated argument. In (101), the
VP headed by the verb panen ‘make’ contains an incorporated U argument. The
evidence is morphological. Observe the REC prefix do- (3I.REC). The REC prefix is the
only type of prefix that may occur only in verbal domain; it never expresses possessors.
In (101), it expresses the U argument of the complex verb yai paneng ‘sing’, literally
‘make songs’ and refers to the human participant that is singing for himself. This is an
instance of an A≡UREC experiencer construction (6.2.5.1), where the A argument di
(3A) is not expressed. As discussed in 5.7.3, such constructions encode a participant
performing an event unintentionally. The VP further contains two aspectual suffixes.

arguments. Another example is given in (102), where noun baloka ‘grass’ is
incorporated in the VP headed by the verb ber- ‘pull’. Also in this case, the REC prefix
do- (3I.REC) is attached to the noun. Observe, that the verb panen ‘make’ is used in an
A-U transitive construction (see 6.2.2.1). The human participant is realized as the A
argument with the free pronoun di (3A). The REC prefix do- (3I.REC) that is attached to
the incorporated noun baloka ‘grass’ co-indexes the same human referent.

incorporated in the VP headed by tinei ‘plait’.
6 REC prefixes combine exclusively with verbs, unlike PAT and LOC prefixes, which may be used to express
possessors. LOC prefixes correspond to alienable (AL) possessive prefixes, PAT to inalienable (INAL)
possessive prefixes.","[260, 261]"

descriptions of events from a perspective that is radically different from that of more
familiar languages. The paradigms suggest that the question of lexicalization cannot be
answered without intensive further research.
Some more paradigms of the CVs with alternating first root are given below. In

caused. The root u ‘leave’ refers to the event that reached its final boundary and has
persistent effect. The initial roots encode the locus. As discussed in the initial part of
this section, the root f ‘sever’ refers to the separation locus of two participants. The
root k ‘bring’ refers to locus that is not in reach but not too remote. The root r ‘reach’
refers to the locus where participants were previously in ‘in reach or fixed’ of each
other. Finally, the root t ‘lie’ refers to horizontal locus of the participants.

with two arguments. The A argument is expressed with the free pronoun di (3A). The U
argument is the NP de-namang ‘her own clothes’ and co-indexed with the prefix ha(3II.PAT) as patient on the CV. It corresponds to the English verb ‘take off’ because it
combines with the argument ‘clothes’.

r-u-l is the NP de-kafiei ‘his goat’. The CV r-u-l corresponds in this case to the English
verb ‘untie’.

‘Simon unties the goat’[B07.042.02]A number of CVs that alternate the first root is given in (131). These CVs refer to a
motion event oriented away from the DC. The root u ‘leave’ indicates that the event
reached its final boundary and persists. As in the previous cases, the root b ‘join’ refers
to an intersection locus, the root f to separation locus. The root k ‘bring’ indicates the
out-of-reach locus that is not remote. It contrasts with the root l ‘give’ that refers to inreach locus. The root t ‘lie’ refers to horizontal locus.

"4.4Noun PhrasesA noun phrase (NP) is a syntactic constituent headed by a noun. It expresses the
argument of a verb. In Abui, the head noun of an NP combines with a number of
adnominal modifiers such as modifier nouns, adjectives, stative verbs, demonstratives,156CHAPTER IVand quantifiers. Modifier nouns (NMOD) specify some property of the referred entity
such as shape, size, age, or gender. Adjectives and stative verbs (ADJ/V) specify some
property of head nouns such as colour, quality, size, taste etcetera. Demonstratives
(DEM) are modifiers expressing something about the identifiability and referentiality of
an NP in space or discourse. Demonstratives that locate the referent in space are
referred to as deictic demonstratives (DEICT); demonstratives that locate the referent in
discourse are anaphoric demonstratives (DEM). As discussed in section 3.5.2, both
subtypes of demonstratives are differentiated by their syntactic position in an NP. The
deictic demonstratives precede the head noun while the anaphoric demonstratives
follow it. Quantifiers (QUANT) express something about the quantity of referents
realized as a noun phrase. As discussed in section 3.5.3, there are two subtypes of
quantifiers: the numerals and non-numeral quantifiers. Quantifiers always follow the
head noun. In Abui, there are complex NPs that contain more than one adnominal
modifier. In such complex NPs, the adnominal modifiers combine in fixed order
schematically illustrated in (67). Of all adnominal modifiers, only deictic demonstratives
(DEICT) and possessors (NPOSS) may precede the head noun, which may carry possessive
inflection (PROPOSS) discussed in section 4.2. The nouns, adjectives, stative verbs,
numeral and non-numeral quantifiers and anaphoric demonstratives must follow the
head noun.6
(67)NP Æ(DEICT) (NPOSS PROPOSS-) N (NMOD) (ADJ/V) (QUANT) (DEM)In the following sections, I will give an overview of each adnominal modifier type. In
section 4.4.1, I describe the modifier nouns that combine with the head noun. In
section 4.4.2, I give an overview of the verbs and adjectives. The demonstratives are
discussed in section 4.4.3. In 4.4.4, I describe the quantifiers. The combinations of
adnominal modifiers in complex NPs are described in section 4.4.5. In section 4.5, I
discuss related complex structures characterized by the intersective linker ba (LNK). In
these structures, a complex modifier (an NP or a clause) is linked by the intersective
linker ba (LNK) to a head noun.","[178, 179]"

immediately follow the head noun. They are followed by adjectives and stative verbs
(ADJ/V), quantifiers (QUANT), and anaphoric demonstratives (DEM). A number of
examples of complex noun phrases are given in (99). In all cases, stative verbs precede
quantifiers; the anaphoric demonstratives are the right most modifiers. In cases when
anaphoric demonstratives co-occur with quantifiers, the quantifiers have to precede
them:(99)DEICT NVdokikabalQUANTPRX

discourse. They are mainly monosyllabic forms (except for oro) that terminate in the
vowel /ɔ/. Demonstratives may combine with nouns, verbs on the phrase level, and
with clauses on the sentence level.
Demonstratives that locate the referent in space are the deictic demonstratives;
they always precede the head noun of an NP. Demonstratives that indicate the location
of the referent in discourse are anaphoric demonstratives; they follow the head noun.
In combination with verbs, the function of Abui demonstratives is analogous to the
nominal domain. When the demonstrative precedes the head verb of a VP, it refers to
the location of the event. When it follows the head verb, it locates the event expressed
by the VP in discourse.
In this section, I first give an overview of Abui deictic demonstratives (see
3.5.2.1), and then discuss the anaphoric demonstratives (see 3.5.2.2). Details about the
usage of the demonstratives in the nominal domain can be found in section 4.4.3;
details about the functions of demonstratives in verbal domain in sections 6.3.2 and
6.4.3.","[132, 133]"
"SERIAL VERB CONSTRUCTIONS377ALLATIVE SERIAL CONSTRUCTION. The first function of the minor verb ng ‘see’ is to
express the goal location of a movement. I will refer to this type of construction as
‘allative SVC’. The semantics of ng ‘see’ contains the direction component necessary to
refer to a goal.15 The goal location is realized as the U argument of the minor verb ng
‘see’. The A argument is shared by both serialized verbs. The allative SVC is
contiguous: no constituent may occur between the minor and major verb. The major
verb is usually a verb of motion or position. An example is given in (85) where the
‘allative’ SVC is contrasted with the monoverbal clause. In (a), the minor verb ng ‘see’
combines with the U argument ya ‘water’ that is interpreted as the goal location of the
motion expressed by the second verb. In (b), the verb sei ‘come down’ occurs in the AULOC transitive construction. Its U argument is expressed with the LOC prefix he(3II.LOC) referring to the NP ya ‘water’. The U argument is interpreted as a specific
location, in this case a purpose.
(85)a. na ya=ngseib. na1SG water=see come.down
‘I come down to water’yahe-sei1SG water 3II.LOC-come.down
‘I come down for some water!’Note that the minor verb ng ‘see’ does not meet the requirements of the minimal
prosodic word. Therefore it forms a single prosodic word with its argument. In case of
a full NP argument, the minor verb combines with the last constituent of the NP such
as demonstratives, quantifiers, adjectives and state verbs (see also 4.4.5). The U
argument of the minor verb ng ‘see’ may be realized as a bound pronoun (pronominal
prefix). An example is given in (86). In (a), the major verb yaar-i ‘go’ combines with ng
‘see’. The U argument of the minor verb wata ‘coconut’ is specified by the REC prefix
on the verb. The REC prefix refers the NP wata ‘coconut’ that is interpreted as
[+individuated]. In result, the construction refers to motion to the ‘top’. In (b), ng ‘see’
is serialized with the verb mit-d-i ‘seat, get sitting’ to add the location argument
expressed with the NP kuda ‘horse’ and co-indexed with the REC prefix ho- (3II.REC).

‘he mounted the horse’, lit.: he got seated on the horse’[B07.056.02]In (87), ng ‘see’ is serialized with rarak ‘shake’. The U argument of the verb ng ‘see’ is
the NP adi ‘sky’, which is co-indexed with the REC prefix ho- (3II.REC). It expresses the
goal location of the construction, a location to which the hand is shaken.","[399, 400]"

SVC with fa ‘be.MD.AD’
The minor verb fa ‘be.MD.AD’ refers to an event location distant from the addressee.
The use of fa implicates realis mode as it marks ‘truly’ occurring events. As realis mode
marker it has also contrastive epistemic function identifying that the information is
either new or unknown to the addressee. The verb fa corresponds roughly in its use to
English ‘actually’. In (101) it is contrasted with two other deictic verbs ta ‘be.PRX.AD’
and la ‘be.MD’ combined in all cases with the major verb sei ‘come down’:

‘it is actually raining (you don’t know yet)’[B05.082.02]Another example is given in (178), where the verb fa ‘be.MD.AD’ is refers to the location
of a questioned car. Note that the deictic verb fa ‘be.MD.AD’ corresponds in usage to the
anaphoric demonstrative nu (SPC.AD).

addressee. It seems to be a general strategy in Abui, as in most or all languages, that the
temporal and discourse dimension and their operators are mostly transferred from theSERIAL VERB CONSTRUCTIONS407spatial dimension and referred to with spatial operators such as deictic verbs. Another
example is given in (179) where the verb fa ‘be.MD.AD’ combines with rul ‘take off’:

SVC with ya ‘be.DST’
The minor verb ya ‘be.DST’ expresses an event location distal from both speech
participants. Its use is illustrated in (180) where the minor verb ya ‘be.DST’ combines
with the verb -iel ‘roast’. In (a) the speaker is located outside the shelter where he is
roasting a fish for the addressee. In such context, he is marked ‘distal’ from the event
location. In (b) the minor verb fa ‘be.MD.AD’ is used because the speaker is roasting a
fish for the addressee inside the shelter, while the addressee is outside:

3II.PAT-roast[B05.042.01]The usage of the minor verb ya ‘be.DST’ is extended to narratives. There it has an

really happened expressing in fact realis mode. This is illustrated in the narrative
fragment in (181):

"178CHAPTER Vevent[SEMANTIC PROPERTIES OF THE EVENT]participant[INHERENT SEMANTIC PROPERTIES]macroroleAU[+CONTROL]
[+VOLITION][+AFFECTED]Figure 18: Semantic features identifying participants for A and U macroroleInherent semantic properties of the participants (animacy) may be sufficient to
determine the direction, in which an event was performed; i.e. who is acting upon
whom. In most cases, participants identified as actor are animate. They are moving,
consuming, cutting etc; they are characterized by features [+CONTROL] and [+VOLITION]
(in that order). On the other hand, participants identified as undergoer tend to be
inanimate. They are consumed, moved, cut; and so on; so in general, they are
characterized as [+AFFECTED].
As mentioned in section 3.2.3, Abui nouns do not display any case inflection.
When arguments are expressed as lexical NPs, the semantic roles of the arguments are
determined by the animacy of their referents. This is illustrated in (1), where a transitive
and an intransitive construction are given. In both constructions, the verb occurs in the
final position; the arguments precede the verb. In (a), the verb nee ‘eat’ combines with
the NPs ama ‘person’ and sieng ‘rice’. The NP ama ‘human’ has an animate referent
and is identified as the A argument. The NP sieng ‘rice’ is identified as the U argument
because it is inanimate. In (b), the NP fala ‘house’ is the single argument of the verb fak
‘break’. It is identified as the U argument because it is affected by course of the event.
(1)a. amasiengneeperson rice
eat
‘someone eats rice/people eat rice’b. falafak-ihouse break-PFV
‘a house broke down’In transitive constructions, the order of arguments expressed as lexical NPs is
determined pragmatically. This is illustrated in (2)-(3), where the syntactic order of the
NPs does not indicate whether they should be identified as A or U arguments. The NP
ama ‘person, people’ has an animate referent. It is identified as the A argument. The
NPs kawen ‘machete’ and bataa ‘wood’ are identified as U arguments because their
referent is inanimate. This shows that the semantic role of an argument is identified by
the animacy of the referent. In pragmatically neutral order, the A argument precedes
the U argument. When the order of arguments is reversed, the semantic roles assigned
to the arguments do not change. Instead, the construction with the reversed NP
ordering is pragmatically marked; the fronted NP expressing the U argument is in
focus.","[200, 201]"

SVC with reduplicated verb
The reduplication of a state verb is a productive strategy to derive manner verbs. The
reduplicated verb combines with the major verb indicating the event. The reduplication
of the manner verb also contributes the ‘increased degree’ component. In (201) the
state verb tukoi ‘be strong’ is reduplicated and serialized with the verb complex yai
paneng ‘sing’ indicating that the ‘singing’ has to be done ‘louder’:
(201) tukoi-tukoi

The first type is discussed in 8.3.4 where a more
general discussion of the notion ‘modality’ can be found. To resume shortly, with
modality I understand either a general intent of the speaker or his attitude towards the
possibility, reality, or desirability of the expressed proposition. This is expressed by the
minor verb in modal SVCs. While in the first type of modal SVCs the minor verb
follows the major verb, in the second type discussed in this section the minor verb
precedes the major verb (cf. example (59) in section 8.3.4). The set of verbs used as414CHAPTER VIIIminor verb in modal SVCs is closed, containing the verbs kul ‘must’ (see 8.4.7.1), kang
‘be good’ (see 8.4.7.2), and ra/re ‘reach’ (see 8.4.7.3).
8.4.7.1
SVC with kul ‘must’
The verb kul ‘must’ is used to express deontic modality. An example is given in (203)
where kul combines with a single A argument:
(203) Floris di kul Petumbang
name 3A must place
‘Floris had to go to Petumbang’yaa-r-i
go-COMPL-PFV
[B10.053.05]The verb kul ‘must’ may occur in different syntactic positions as illustrated in (204)
with a distinct reading. In (a) the modal follows the pronoun forming a contiguous SVC
with sakoladi ‘learn’ and encoding deontic modality. However, in (b) the NP is
extracted in pragmatic position and the A marking free pronoun di (3A) intervenes
between kul and sakoladi ‘learn’. This non-contiguous SVC encodes epistemic
modality:
(204) a. moku fil-a
di kul sakola-d-i=se
kid
be.young 3A must school-hold-PFV=INCP.I
‘the small child must learn’b. mokufilakul[B10.053.08]di sakola-d-i=sekid
be.young must 3A school-hold-PFV=INCP.I
‘the small child is certainly about to learn’[B10.053.08]In instances such as (b) kul may be considered to be an adverb. Note that adverbs are
mainly found preceding the A argument in the left edge of a clause or in the clauseinitial pragmatic position. In some cases they are preceded by focussed argument.
Another instance of kul ‘must’ displaying adverbial features is given in (205). Here kul
indicates epistemic modality; the dog is reported to be ‘certainly’ lost:
(205) he-kaai
kul kupai tama=ng
3II.AL-dog must forest
sea=see
‘his dog certainly got lost in the forest’nai-d-i
lost-hold-PFV[B07.023.01]To express alethic modality kul can be used. The presence of the food is qualified as
logical necessity by the speaker in the following example where kul combines with du
that is here used to express that food has to ‘accompany’ or simply ‘be there’:
(206) nala

kul ha-d-u

‘there must be food, one has to eat’[B07.014.03]SERIAL VERB CONSTRUCTIONS4158.4.7.2

The verb kang ‘be good’ indicates that an event ‘really’ happened. An example is given
in (207) where kang is serialized with wel ‘pour’.
(207) di
kang
3A
be.good
‘he is bathing’da-wel
3I.PAT-pour
[B07.073.02]The verb kang occurs frequently in narratives to indicate that the reported events truly
happened. Constructions with kang occurred frequently in elicitations of the Man Tree
game. 23 In the following example taken from a narrative the water bucket is being
reported as truly getting empty:
(208) ya

‘the water (bucket) was empty again’do
PRX
[B02.135.04:05]In modal SVC of the type illustrated above, the verb kang combines exclusively with
third person arguments expressed obligatorily with the free pronoun di (3A) and an
optional NP. This serial construction is a source of the adverb dikang ‘again’, an
instance of its use is given in (209). I analyze the form dikang as an adverb ‘again’,
because the A argument is expressed with second person singular free pronoun a (2SG).
More details can be found in section 6.3.

SVC with ra/re ‘reach’
The verb ra/re ‘reach’ occurs in serial construction to express speaker’s intention to
perform some activity. Abui verb ‘reach’ has two alternating stems: the inceptive stem
re ‘reach, try’ refers to reaching or trying that has an initial point. This verb is also used
in aspectual SVC illustrated in 8.3.1.3. The continuative stem ra ‘reach, attempt’ is used
when the event of trying has not clear initial and final point, it has a reading of ‘reach’
or ‘attempt, persist’. The minor verb ra/re ‘reach’ usually occurs in A≡UPAT
experiencer construction (6.2.5.2), expressing a single participant with both free and
bound pronoun. Consider now (210):23 Man-Tree game is a MPI elicitation tool designed to provide stimuli and help elicit spatial reference and

One of the consultants is to describe the photographs that consequently have to be correctly identified by the

[B02.048.17:28]I have found no plural forms such as *n- (1PL.E.INAL), *p- (1PL.I.INAL), and *r- (2PL.INAL).
This is caused by the fact that the plural possessors are rare and if present they are
expressed by the distributive prefix ta- (DISTR.INAL) as illustrated in (19).

[B06.080.02:19]As illustrated in (16), the number of body-part nouns is limited. More specific
body parts are referred to with the constructions given in (20)-(21). These constructions
are formally possessive constructions or compounds. For the formal criteria
distinguishing compounds and noun phrases, see sections 4.3.1 and 4.4.1.

*he-mol*ne
*molA number of lexical items identified in (16)-(22) are ambiguous. These items, given in
(23), are found as heads of both NPs and VPs. They are identified as inalienably
possessed nouns, or as verbs. In (a), the forms bang ‘shoulder’ and bang ‘carry on
shoulder’ are phonologically identical. So are the forms -mol ‘enemy’ and -mol ‘envy’.
The forms in (c, d) carry a different tone. The noun -ièng ‘eye’ is marked with the low
tone, while the verb -iéng ‘see’ carries the high tone. The tone distinctions are not
systematic; the noun táng ‘hand’ in (d) carries the high tone, while the verb tàng
‘release’ carries the low tone. Other words such as baki (e) or toku (f) are possibly of
verbal origin. For more information about tone, see section 2.5.4.

the head of a VP and combines with two arguments. The presence of the free pronoun
di (3A) indicates the structure as a clause. At the same time, the free pronoun excludes
the possibility of interpreting the structure as a possessive construction. In (b), the form
na-mol is used referring to a person that hates the speaker.

‘my enemy’[B04.079.01]The second subset of inherently/inalienably possessed nouns contains two kinship
terms ai ‘wife’ and kuta ‘grandparent’. They are the only kinship terms that combine
with prefixes of set I. The other kinship terms are optionally/alienably possessed; I
discuss them in section 4.2.3. Consider now example (25) and observe the unusual
inflection of the stems hai, ai, nai, tai referring to ‘wife’. The onset of the stem
referring to ‘wife’ is always the same as the onset of the possessive prefix.

DISTR.AL-wifee. e-kuta2SG.AL-grandparentThe stem referring to ‘wife’ seems to carry double pronominal inflection. The alienable
pronominal prefix is attached to a stem. There is another pronominal prefix attached to
the nominal root ai. The root ai itself is polysemous; it covers a range of meanings such
as ‘vein’, ‘root’, and ‘side’. The meaning ‘wife’ maybe diachronically derived from the
verbal stem ai ‘be at side’ as illustrated in (26). The stem ai combines with a pronominal
prefix expressing the U argument. The VP is reanalyzed as a new nominal stem and
takes alienable possessive inflection.

(ALIEANABLE). This is illustrated in (27), where the nouns may combine only with
alienable possessive prefixes (see left-hand column), but not with inalienable possessive
prefixes (in middle column). These nouns are free forms that do not require possessive
inflection (see right-hand column).
