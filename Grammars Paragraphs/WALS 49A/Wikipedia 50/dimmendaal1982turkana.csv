"The final part of this section discusses complications which occur when
basic dynamic verbs are changed into Stative verb constructions.
Subject is defined in terms of a noun phrase in a basic sentence indicating
the Positioner. The sentence can be either verbal or non-verbal. The subject
is marked explicitly with nominative case (by way of tonal inflection) when3.2.2. Syntactic functionsit follows a verb (either a füll verb, in a verbal sentence, or an auxiliary
verb, in a non-verbal sentence). Only noun phrases with the label Positioner""Syntactic functions specify the perspective frorn which that state of affairs is presented in the linguistic expression."" (Dik (1978:13))can function äs subjects in basic predicate frames. Som examples:

Direct object function is defined in terms of a noun phrase in a basic

cannot become the subject of a basic sentence. Similarly, in Turkana a Dative
noun phrase cannot be assigned subject function or direct object function.
According to the 'passive' criterion among others, there is no real 'subject
assignment' or 'object assignment' in Turkana, since these functions are
invariably assigned;to noun phrases with specific semantic labeis. In our(4)^-räm-i' nesi na-atuk^

For a description of this see section 4.9.2.2. These constructions
complicate the agreement marking System in Turkana.. They are briefly in-sentence, äs shown in sections 3.7. and 3.9.
Indirect object is defined in terms of a noun phrase in a basic sentence
indicating the Dative.As noted above, it only occurs with dynamic verbtroduced in section 3.9. below. One example is given below, in order to illustrate the point. In addition, the active counterpart is given:constructions. Its presence is excluded with Stative verb constructions,(9)ji-^-ram-a nesi'äs well äs in non-verbal sentences. The indirect object, äs an animate en-not-e-beat-Vtity, always precedes the direct object in a sentence. Examples:

In the second example the third person pronoun functions äs the subject
of the clause, whereas the noun indicating 'cows' functions äs a direct
object. In the first example the pronoun 'him' is no longer a core noun

indicated on the verb if the subject noun phrase occurs in the plural. Although in example (9) the noun 'cows' occurs in the nominative, there is
no plural marker in the verb. Accordingly, such a 'derived subject', markedsetting in which the sequence of constituents may be used.

There is no gender agreement between noun phrases and verbs.
On the basis of morphological differences in the specific form of a gender prefix, the nouns are divided into three groups:

to be made regarding the underlying tone of number Suffixes. It is clear from
the present state of knowledge of Turkana that with nominal roots consisting
of three or more vowels only the low tone insertion ruie (for the second mora
of the root) applies. Apart from this ruie no special tonal modification occurs if the nominal root consists of three or more vowels, i.e. Suffixes retain their underlying tone. The noun äs a whole does not receive a fixed tone
pattern if the noun shows up such a syllabic complexity. A clear pattern emerges from this, showing that all Suffixes used äs pluratives, or those that
are typically used for plurals, all have low tones. The typical singulative
Suffixes carry a high tone (plus a floating low tone). There is, thus, in-5.3.1. Pronouns and case
Pronominal forms can occur in (a) the nominative, (b) the absolute, (c) the
locative, (d) the genrtive, and (e) the vocative case, but not in the instrumental case. As with nouns, and modifiers within the noun phrase, the
forms found with the absolute case are unmarked (see also the sections on
case-coding (3.2.4.) and pronouns (5.1.)).
When pronouns occur in the nominative, two sets are found, depending on
their syntactic position before pause versus other positions. When they occur in the position before pause, the following forms are found:ternal evidence indirectiy that the markers with low tone, which now can be1 a-yagSingular

fairly complex. This System with relative clause forms is, therefore, discussed separately in section 5.6.3. below.
Nominative case marking differs from the other case inflection types discussed below, in that the narker itself is a morpheme consisting of a low
tone, whereas with other cases the tonal inflection is probably best re-a-b er-u kag ^

between the gender prefix and the following morpheme (most often the noun'my wife'stem), and between the stem and the number suffix, if the latter occurs:Pronominal forms, may, furthermore, occur äs vocatives. In that case their
form (excluding tone) is äs with the absolute case. However, the tone pattern of the pronouns differs in that case. With vocatives the tone patternThe low tone is grounded on the following syllable, thereby displacingof pronouns (and nouns) is: L(L....) H L .

The absolute caseIt is used to indicate an indefinite series of high tones, which all becomeis used with direct objects, indirect objects and subject noun phrases thatlow if they occur in a sequence next to each other.)are fronted or demoted for some pragnatic raason. The striking thing about
Turkana and other verb-initial languages within Nilotic (äs well äs in the
closely related group of Surma languages) is the fact that the nominative,
and, thus, the subject (in .transitive and intransitive sentences) is the
marked case. This, however, fits in with another observation made with regard to the syntax of Turkana, namely the fact that the subject is a marked
function in other respects äs well, because it is omissible, or unexpressible in several constructions (3.3.4.). (See also Dimmendaal (1983) for
a theoretical approach to case marking and syntactic structure.)Tonal shifts never occur across morpheme boundaries. The various changes
are illustrated below. As complications occur with a number of •nouns, four
groups need to be distinguished. These groups do not coincide with morphological groups. They are related to the phonological structure of the word.
It is noted that the kind of changes described for nouns below are the same
for other nominal categories like pronominal possessive markers and others,
provided that they have the same phonological structure. Only i'n the case
of dynamic relative clauses extra complications occur, due to the presence
of agreement markers on the verb in the relative clause.
With the first group of nouns no complications occur. Compare the ab-solute case form and the nominative case form in the example below:number suffix {-a}. AS noted in the discussion of number inflection above,absolute case

Non-verbal sentences may also occur in adjuncts äs Subordinate clausessumed to be known to the Speaker and the hearer, because they are presupposed,
or because they present entities known to the hearer.
The kind of process described in this section may be called 'verb strengthening', a phenomenon that seems to be more common in African languages (Paul

whereby the main verb is repeated in the Infinitive at the end of the sen-occupied by emphasized categories or clauses, and, äs with emphasized noun
phrases, an anaphoric pronoun occurs in the position of COMP (complement).tence, äs in Turkana.
Knowledge of verb strengthening with the various moods is incomplete.
Apart from examples with verbs in the indicative mood, äs those presented
above, only examples with emphasis in imperative verb forms are available.
These are basically the same äs those with the indicative mood, the only
difference being that no auxiliary verb form (the verb •to be somebody, some-However, äs a result of the fronting of the time complement (and other adjuncts, äs shown below), the main verb occurs in the subjunctive. (For an
attempt to relate the various instances in the sentence where the subjunctive is required see section 7.6. above.)
When an Instrument phrase is emphasized, the same strategy is employed
with regard to fronting, anaphoric pronoun insertion, and subjunctive mar-thing') is used. One example:king on the main verb. When the Instrument phrase is fronted, the linker

Compare the two sentences below:As with specific sentence level adverbs discussed below, it also seems
to be possible to front a construction used for the purpose of emphasis,
in order to turn it into a new topic (so-called -topicalization of emphasis-,
for which see section 8.5. below). One examples:

Further, the noun phrase about which information is being, expressed is
marked with the nominative case when the predicate (the Proclaimed noun

A noun phrase in Turkana consists of a head noun (or pronoun) with various
types of modifiers, äs shown in chapter 5. A noun phrase, however, may be
headless, i.e. it may occur without a head noun (or pronoun). Accordingly,
modifiers can occur without a head noun being expressed äs predicates inNon-verbal relative clauses can be used äs predicates, and so can dynamic
relative clauses based on a verb. Stative relative clauses are•used äs
oredicates when they refer to ai definite entity. This implies that there is a
condition which says that if a predication is indefinite,a different framework is to be used. There are two possibilities in this respect. The relative clause is tö be changed into a positioner noun, or it is to be changed
into a füll verb, in which case it precedes the subject noun phrase:

In the latter example, taken from a trickster tale, a lion is envious'äs for the ostrich, it has nice chicks'
A final type of topicalization with associative constructions is foundof the ostrich for its pretty chicks, that have already been referred to inwith locative complements in sentences. If the complement consists of athe discourse, from the ostrich, who has been introduced äs well at an ear-noun (phrase) expressing a 'part', the noun posessor, indicating the 'whole',lier stage. The ostrich thus functions äs a topic to which something happens.is treated äs a direct object (or indirect object). One example:The Inversion and juxtaposition of the two nouns (without any genitival case
inflection) may be regarded äs another instance of topicalization, whereby
the topic precedes the comment part ( 'the chicks') .
As noted in the discussion of gender and agreement, nominal gender prefixes no longer express specificity or definiteness in Turkana. In a gender
language, where these markers still have this function, such a word order
change would not be necessary (äs in e.g. Lotuxo, another Eastern Nilotic
language). Givon (1976b:177) has claimed that ""the possessor....is normally
more topical....and most commonly definite"", and, therefore, moved ahead of
the oossessed. If this is true, one would expect this type of associative
construction with a topicalized noun possessor to become the unmarked type.
As can be expected, Inversion is most common with proper names and pronouns.k-icake-munina-kowu

(This type of construction is further discussed in section 6.2.)
Due to the topicalization, Turkana is developing a different type of associative construction, whereby nouns (in combination with pronouns) are
simply juxtaposed in an inverted order, that of noun possessor followed by
the noun possessed. All these constructions indicate an intimate, sometimes
inalienable relation between constituents. Such constructions are identical
with regard to their internal structure to at least the following types of
juxtaposed nouns^. because no genitive case is assigned to the second noun:In terms of the historical dynamics of the process, the change is likely to(a) Prepositional noun plus noun:occur for the same reason äs, and parallel to the Inversion of word order

nouns (names) is correct, this would also explain another observation made
by Greeriberg (1966:112) :

the language is one in which the governing noun precedes its dependent

The phrases indicating a cause or reason have been grouped together, because
they are semantically very dose, and offen indistinguishable. Clauses of

Clauses indicating a purpose have been treated äs sub-types of subordinate clauses, äs illustrated in section 6.9. As the examples below show,
the semantic distinction between cause and purpose is not always clearcut.
The first sentence below is the only example available which is to be interpreted äs a main predicate followed by a clause indicating a cause. The latter
is introduced by way of the form {kotere} . With our data this particie is
only used with nouns immediately following:tion synchronically at least is undefined. The morphemes structurally occur
in a position occupied by agreement markers. Given the above principle, they
historically probably performed that function. This would fit in with the suggestion made by Greenberg (1981) that 'moveable k' (with or without a vowel
following) performed a deictic function.
A further interesting illustration of the validity of this principle at
the morphological levei is the following: number markers on the verb may also carry Information on the syntactic arguments involved in the predication
of which the verb is the central part. (For further notes on this see also
section 4.6.1. above.) Looking at case marking in nouns, one notes that case
is indicated on the morpheme following the gender prefix (not necessarily
the root), äs well äs on number Suffixes, by way of a tonal layer, e.g. with(15) e-bur-un-it' nesi' kotere na-jeme-i'

(16) a-Uumi -ar-lt kstere e-tici. kan'
J-send-JT-A
because work "" my
'I use it for my work'the nominative case. Accordingly, the number suffix with nouns also carries
Information on the case function of the noun äs a whole.
Apart from its relevance to synchronic analysis and internal reconstruction at the morphological level, the principle is reflected at the syntactic level. One clear instance of this is discussed separately in the following section. A further consequence of the principle of natural serialization7.6. The principle of natural serialization
Bartsch and Vennemann (1972:131) have formulated a principle which says:is that all modifiers of nouns and verbs follow these categories. Thus demonstratives normally follow the head noun. They may be prefixed to the noun
stem in order to focus attention on the stem ('whichever. . . ' ) . Similarly,""....elements belonging together in the hierarchy of semantic representation tend to be lexicalized and serialized in the surface representationadverbs follow the verb. However, when the deictic category of adverbs sets
a spatial or temporal framework within which the main predication holds, thisis done so by placing i t in a Position preceding the verb.
The principle has further historical consequences, in that specific in-at different grammatical levels in Turkana. One good reason for extraposition

7.7. Extraposition
Extraposition or 'heavy-shift' of specific lexical items occurs whenever theThus, the agreement marking on the verb is still indicative of the doublecategory domtnating the item contains another lexical item. Thus, if a noun(plural subject). But the second pronoun, which occurs later on the scaleis modified by two adjectives, e.g. 'a big, black cat' ) , the second ad-of the prominence , hierarchy, is moved into the position of a comitativejective is moved into a position of a Subordinate clause in that utterance.
Similarly, with verbs or other categories movement into the position of a
subordinate clause occurs, instead of co-ordination or juxtaposition. Extraposition äs a process has been found to occur in at least the following cate-phrase, where it occurs in the absolute case, instead of in the nominative
case. With a co-ordination of 'I and you' äs the subject a conflict would
occur, because they have the same Status on the scale of the prominence
hierarchy. This problem has been solved in the language by the use of a pronominal form indicäting ' we inclusive'. The form indicating 'we inclusive'gories :is found in all languages of the Teso group. Extranositiom of this kind is

Direct objects and indirect objects may also be topicalized, although
this seems to be far less common, except with VOS basic word order (see below). One reason for this may be that with VSO sentences the subject is most
often definite and animate, and, accordingly, a topic favorite. Some examples
with a topicalized direct object or indirect object:The back-porch, i.e. the complement (COMP) phrase following the core sentence, is also used for noun phrases demoted from the core sentence. In other
words, it may perform a chomeur function. The term 'chömeur' ia used in relational grammar to indicate noun phrases that bear no longer any term grammatical relation (subject, direct object or indirect object), because some
other noun phrase has assumed that specific role. As noted in 4.9.2.2., the

have been discussed in chapter 3.
The verb root may be extended by two types of derivational Suffixes. These
Suffixes, are discussed under the section of 'stem-formation' below. A verb
root expanded by one or more derivational Suffixes is called a 'lexical stem'
or 'derived stem' in this study. The lexical stem (or root, if no derivational Suffixes occur) forms the input to any type of verbal construction,
either an Infinitive or a finite (conjugated) verb.
The root or stem is preceded and followed by various morphemes indicating
e.g. 'agreement' (with noun phrases), 'tense', 'aspect' and 'voice'.
The internal structure of the conjugated verb is presented in the tabie
below. The internal structure of the conjugated verb in Turkana is comparable
to that of the Infinitive verb, but a number of differences can be indicated:
(a) Infinitive verbs do not take agreement markers
(b) Infinitive verbs do not take tense markers.
(c) Infinitive verbs do not take negation markers.
(d) Infinitives behave like nouns in various respects. They also take
a feminine gender prefix.

The use of a locative verb in order to express an existential Situation
or a possessive construction is fairly conmion in languages (see e.g. Clark
(1970), or Lyons (1967:391)). The lack of a special 'habere' verb is ty-iical of verb-initial and verb-final languages according to Berman (1980).
The existential meaning of these possessive constructions above follows
from the fact that the subject noun .phrase is indefinite. If the possessed

This section discusses, or rather introduces a general syntactic phenomenon
of Turkana whereby definite noun phrases referring to animate entities precede indefinite ones in a sentence. It should be noted that the knowledge
of this phenomenon in the language is still far from complete.
The verb in a basic unmarked sentence occurs initially. With regard to
noun phrases following, several possibilities occur with regard to linear
ordering. Thus, it is not necessarily the case that the subject immediately
follows the verb. The Claim made by Heine (1980:45) that in Turkana "" the
place of the subject noun phrase is immediately after the verb, i.e. it cannot be preceded by any constituent depending on the verb, like an object'non-configurational languages', because the presumed verb phrase constituentnoun phrase or an adverbial phrase"", is incorrect. Furthermore, the secondis discontinuous.

object. As was noted in the section on sübjectiess sentences, a subject
is obligatory if an indirect object and a direct object occur in a sentence . Such constructions with the latter two types of functions expressed always require an Agentive subject noun phrase in other words. The word order
in such sentences is always: verb-subject-indirect object-direct object. Ägain, this can be related to the prominence hierarchy operating in Turkana.
The subject is always a definite and animate entity, because it can operate

The direct object,The one affected in the sentence above is more prominent (since it is defi-i.e. the entity serving as the Goal, can be definite and animate, but it doesnite and animate) in general terms than the causer of the event, in thisnot control the event. Accordingly, it occurs after the subject and the in-case 'a snake' , which refers to an animate, but indefinite entity.direct object. Most often the direct object is an inanimate object that isThe possessor with possessive phrases is more prominent, or salient, and
accordingly precedes the possessed. In the example below, an intransitivetransferred.
In sentences with a subject noun phrase and an indirect object noun phrase,verb occurs, followed by a noun indicating the possessor 'him' , which iswhereby the former is inanimate, whereas the latter is definite and animate,followed by the noun indicating the posssessed ('cubs').

(Compare a similar construction in German: -Dein Name is mir entf alien- .)
This type of construction may be compared with two-place verbs with a dummy
subject and an indirect object above in section 3.4. Again, the indirect
object does not necessarily follow or precede the subject. Its place is de-In sentences with adjunct!val phrases the hierarchy principle also operates.
If the adjunctival phrase contains a subordinate clause, whereby a participant of speech functions as the subject, the latter is obligatorily raised
from that clause into the matrix clause. Raising is not obligatory if a
third person pronoun, a proper name, an:animate or inanimate noun occur as
the subject in the subordinate clause. One example:

Note that because the pronoun -you (plural) @ functions as a direct
object of the verb in the subordinate clause, it occurs in the absolute case.
(Raising and related problems (e.g. case coding) are discussed in section 6.9.)
If in a sentence the direct object expresses the whole, and the locative
complement expresses the part in a construction expressing possession, the
direct object normally precedes the subject of that sentence. Although it
may follow the subject, most informants prefer the order VOS in such sentences . One example:
(9) k-a-koji-i 'that the subject can occur finally in transitive (and intransitive) sentences in Turkana and other Nilotic languages requires further attention from
the point of view of general linguistics, especially since it is also found
in unrelated verb-initial languages like Fijian, Malagasy and Tagalog, all
of which belong to the Austronesian language family.
In Turkana constituent ordering thus also depends on the potential definiteness (and animacy) of an entity starting from pronouns, via proper nouns
to common nouns that are animate and inanimate, as is further demonstrateda-yog't-me-bite-Amee-mun^lo-ki-moy-insnake (N) in-finger'A snake bit me in my finger (or I was bitten by a snake

i.n a verbal construction) are linked by an associative marker. Some examples:(3)e-yen-e'' ken' a ra-ane-1

The unmarked position of numerais and other quantifiers within the noun

When numerais are used in a predicative sense, they take the [-restrictive] agreement marker. It is possible, however, to leave out the agreement(See also Gulliver (1958) for an interesting account of counting with the
fingers among the Turkana.)
Other types of constructions with numerais involved are to be found in
section 5.6.3.3. (on ordinals) and section 6.8. (on quantification and
frequency).

"The inclusive/exclusive distinction is a common feature of the Teso group
within Eastern Nilotic. The first person plural inclusive form above embraces
'I and you', i.e. those participating in a Speech event, äs against the first
person plural exclusive form, which refers to 'I and somebody not participating in the Speech event', thereby excluding the addressee in the Speech act.
The presumed linguistic universal mentioned in Greenberg (1963:113), 'if
a language has gender categories in the noun, it has gender categories in the
pronoun' is contradicted in Turkana, and, therefore, requires further explanation. One possible explanation for this is the fact that in Turkana (and
Nilotic languages in general) pronouns are only used in those cases were ambiguity ""would otherwise result, or in marked constructions due to topicalization or contrastive emphasis where the pronauns perform an anaphoric function (see chapters 7 and 8). Because of the extensive agreement marking system on the verb, pronouns may be left out in intransitive and transitive sentences, i.e. Turkana is a 'pro-drop' language:(l) e-los-i'

with nouns with a basic form in the singular, as well as with nouns with abas ic form in the plural. One example:

One more example will illustrate the plural form of the anaphoric element:""wild fruit and honey constituted their food'(15) qa-bery,(Note also that the verb which follows the anaphoric pronoun occurs in the
Singular.)
The sentence above also provides a case of subject emphasis in a non-verbal sentence (the verb form being treated äs an auxiliary). As can be seen
from this example, the strategy for emphasis in this case is the same äs that
for noun phrases in verbal sentences. Some other examples of non^verbal-.^sen-keci e-a-twa-k-e-te,

Although a direct object or indirect object can be emphasized, only few
examples have been recorded in actual Speech. The examples with emphasized

Examples:relative clause. The predicate may also be emphasized. This is done by fronting

3-be-Ahim seif'he himself beat his wife'3-PA-beat-A wife'hisverbs. With specific emphatic predicates an anaphoric pronoun is inserted in
the position of the complement (COMP). Accordingly, a non-verbal sentence with
an emphatic predicate can be presented äs follows in a tree-diagram:a-yoqI W)entiy from other categories.
With regard to sentences without participants a further (phonological)
complication occurs with regard to the tonology of the final demonstrative
form. The basic form of the third person pronoun in sentence (2) above is:

following realization according to the regulär ruies of the language:NPAnaphoric Demonstrative

than the preceding high tone, i.e. key-'raising occurs:fronted, and the empty predicate slot is occupied by a demonstrative. Compare the following examples:->-nesina[nesi'na]'here he is'or: [nesi' + na](1) gesi' E-kadok-ot

constituent (compare the Situation with non-verbal sentences, äs discussed
in section 3.4.). Accordingly, one has to conclude that the pronoun occurs
in the slot termed COMP (Complement) here. When participants are involved,
a slightly different System occurs. Compare the following example:

Depending on whether the verb is an
The position of noun phrases following the verb is fairly free, but spe-cific ruies determined by the definiteness hierarchy do occur. The verb in
Turkana can stand on its own. These characteristics may be due to the extensive case-coding System on the verb. As VOS structures have not been re-action verb, a process verb or a Stative verb, the direct object functions
äs a Goal, a Processed or a Prodaimed entity. Some examples:

(6)a-^not-l-kin-U3.3.3. Three-place verbs
Three-place verbs are transitive verbs with an indirect object in addition
to the direct object and the subject. The indirect object precedes the direct
object in all basic sentence types. If a subject noun phrase and a direct
object noun phrase occur, the indirect object is placed in between. If the
direct object is absent systematically in a specific predicate frame (i.e.
if it cannot be expressed), the subject follows the indirect object. (For
examples of this see the sections below.)
The indirect object performs the semantic function of Beneficiary, Ex-(6) a-inoi-i-^iii-i @- "" @'-@' a-yoQ
3-look-e-DAT-A
I (N) -T(N)

Middle voice also occurs with verbs taking a dative extension. With this
type of predication, the dative refers to a location, as in the following
example:
(7)'e-tlb!@(s-3-kin-a nes^
3-drop-e-DAT-V
he (N)
'he has fallen down'periencer or Recipient. The verb itself is marked with a dative extension(The literal translation of the final verb form is: -he has thrown down(which is discussed in setion 4.5.5.) Some examples:himself .)

3-beat-e-DAT-pl
animals (N) squirrelphrase is in the nominative case. Contrary to other constructions, the dative

hands@the animals clapped hands for the squirrel'
(3)to-'^yak-a-k^ nest i-tuan; a-torob^
3-divide-e-DAT he (N) personchest'he shared the chest with the person'
As the English translations in (2) and (3) show, the Dative noun phrase
often corresponds to a noun phrase introduced by a preposition in English.
in Turkana prepositional phrases and indirect objects are also related syntactically, as is illustrated in section 6.2. Clauses with a prepositional
phrase indicating a comitative are sometimes due to the extraposition of
a second lexical item in a subject noun phrase, as in the following example.
This type of 'heavy-shift- is further discussed in section 7.7.place, or has taken place.","[42, 43, 44]"
"3.3.4. Subjectless sentences
There are three types of subjectless sentences in Turkana:
(a) Sentences where a subject noun phrase is absent, because it is understood from the context in which the utterance is used (ellipsis).
in that case the subject can always optionally be expressed. These
are regular sentences with a presupposed subject noun phrase (a pronoun) . Accordingly, Turkana can be called a -pro-drop' language. Oneexample:-21

Modifying particies are somewhat problematic in terms of categorial strucare. They are probably best analyzed äs modifiers with a focus function.
With regard to adjunctival constructions indicating location or time, 11
lould be noted that these very same categories may also function äs sen-One important note should be pointed out first. Given a locative or temporal phrase in a specific sentence, its syntactic Status äs either an adjunct or a sentence level adverb depends on the verb in that sentence. In
the traditional generative model äs developed in Chomsky (1965:102) and subsequent studies, locative constructions (and time phrases) may occur either
äs constituents of the verb phrase, or äs constituents of the predicative
phrase. In the present description, where there is no verb phrase assumed,

Prepositions indicate a location or direction in relation to a particularvent or Situation. They are also used with verbs without any localistic func-As these examples show, the underlying gender of the prepositions can be
deduced from their behaviour when they indicate source, or when they function

The prepositions probably originated from nouns (of either gender). Com-are the preposition indicating 'down, underneath' and the word for

Some nouns can also be used in a prepositional sense:

A few examples have been found where specific prepositions are used in
a non-locative sense in a way that is also common among Germanic languages.
The extension to the non-locative sense may therefore be a more general property of prepositions. (Note that the ventive and itive extensions, which clearly have a locative meaning with some verbs, have a non-locative function
with several other verbs (see sections 4.5.3. and 4.5.4.).)3-PA-CAU-think-A children of at-school

an adverb with an anaphoric function:Furthermore, the following geographical terms can be included:
kuju''north'kwap^'south'kide^'east'too'wesfIt is noted that the term for 'south' may also mean 'down, underneath'When adverbs of place function äs phrases indicating a source, they areor 'place where the water flows to' (i.e. the plains, with regard topreceded by the linker { ka } .

' wesf. The term for 'north' has one unique derivative form meaning 'God' :

Time complements may consist of one lexical item or a compound form, or
a simple form plus a relative clause, all of which are illustrated below.
Some examples of simple adverbs of time:A few compounds occur, which are based on time complements which also

offen consists of a noun, but the noun itself can take a modifier. The Instrument phrase may indicate a number of aspects:
(a) Instrument with which some verbal act is performed.complements in phrases indicating 'before' , 'within' and similar construotions. In order to indicate 'before' , a phrase is used with the auxiliary(b) The way in which a specific verbal act is performed.verb meaning 'still' , which precedes the time marker:(c) Means by which such a verbal act is performed.(l)to-bog-u e-roko

In order to indicate the concept 'within' a specific noun is put into
the locative case (l). The noun is treated äs a complement indicating a sour-following noun. This is another instance of the kind of process described
in section 2.3.4. above. The linker itself is widespread in Nilotic languages
(compare e.g. Nuer, äs described in Crazzolara (1933:186)).
The unmarked position of the Instrument phrase is after the direct object

wo, or three noun phrases. In the same way äs with modifiers in the noun
hrase, a fixed basic Order of constituents occurs. All modifiers given beow can occur äs adjuncts, but the presence or absence of one of these reuires the use of specific grammatical constructions. As with the noun phrase,here are strong indications that the adjunctival slot has an internal hier-cedes the complement in addition to the use of special locative gender prefixes, äs will be illustrated below. The linker preceding the complement with
the indication of source is {a} in the central dialect (described here), and
{ka} in the northern dialect. In addition, modifiers following nouns are preceded by either a linker {'k.a.' } (with demonstratives), or {a} (preceding all
other modifiers) when the complement äs a whole indicates a source. A few

For most nouns gender is inherent and unpredictable. Farina (1964:13) has
attempted to relate gender to specific semantic properties of nouns for the
closely related language Karimojong. As noted by Heine (1980:46), ""exceptions are numerous. The majority of nouns [in Turkana and Karimojong] do not

Turkana has a postnominal relative clause strategy, i.e. the relative
clause foliows the head noun. The relative clause itself may be verbal or'the boy hit me the other day'

boyand füll basic sentences are also outlined below.
The relative clause is introduced by one of the following agreement markers:that other day I-hit-AI (N)'the boy that I hit the other day'

When a par-Relativeclausemarkersticipant occurs äs the direct object or indirect object in the clause, the(qI)na'(i]u)na'adverb of time is further modified, äs in example (2) above.(qu)lu'slight modifications) of relative clauses presented in Keenan and ComrieSeveral of the clauses presented below are translations (sometimes with(gi)ni'

Ihus in order to distinguish a non-restrictive Stative relative clause from
an identical type which is used in a restrictive sense, word order change
occurs.
In relative clauses the same tense-aspect distinctions are found äs with
verbs in füll sentences. With resultative constructions and impersonal ac-VV-V-tive constructions, which are intransitive (or: detransitivized), one may
still find the (presupposed) force behind the resulting state, or event, in
the matrix clause. In this way, relative clauses and Subordinate clauses in*V = any vowel marking agreement with regard to person.)
As noted above, the clause is introduced by way of gender and number
sensitive agreement markers. The markers are preceded by the linker {ä}

Kenya in an area extending from the Sudan border, south and southeast to
the country of the Pokot, the Samburu and the Rendille, and from the border with Uganda eastwards äs far äs Lake Turkana (formerly Lake Rudolf).
The Turkana traditionally are predominantly pastoral herdsmen, who raise
cattle, sheep, goats and camels in hard climatic conditions. People living
in the northern and southern parts of the area also practice some agriculture. In more recent times, agricultural projects have been started throughout the area. Along Lake Turkana people also practise fishing, a means of
subsistence traditionally excluded, because of a taboo on fish-eating, äs
is the case with many East-African pastoralists (cf. Best, 1978).
The people call themseives /ni-turk(w)ana/ (singular: /e-turk(w)ana-it/) ,
and their language /na-turk(w)ana/. They call their country /turk(w)an'/
They are reasonably well known from anthropological descriptions, especially through studies by Gulliver (e.g. 1958, 1963, 1966). The oral tradition of the Turkana people äs well äs of related groups is presented in
Lamphear (1976). According to this tradition the Turkana and other groups
such äs the Karimojong all dispersed from the Koten area in northeastern
Uganda a few centuries ago. (A text dealing with the oral tradition of the
Turkana has been included at the end of this grammar.) The later, colonial'
history of the Turkana people is described in Barber (1968). More recently, Fedders and Salvadori (1977) have written an illustrated study of Turkana craftsmen.
The exact number of Speakers of Turkana is not known. According to the
Kenya Population Census of 1969 (Ministry of Finance and Econpmic Planning,
Nairobi) there were 203,177 native Speakers in that year, most of whom lived
in the Turkana district of Kenya. Others lived in the western part of the
Samburu district, äs well äs in Isiolo district, mainly in and around Isiolo town. The area inhabited by the Turkana probably is still expanding. More
recently, Turkana people have settled in and around Kitale (see also map).
Heine (1980:32) estimates their number at around 220,000. Some governmentofficials have stated more recently that the figure of 250.000 or even beyond may be more accurate. (For details of second language use and other
sociolinguistic aspects of Turkana see Whiteley (1974:13-68)).
The Turkana area is divided into territorial sections which seem to be
related to the migration and expansion of various Turkana groups over the
last few centuries (Lamphear, 1968). The borders are rather fluent, especially in the north across the Sudan border, where the Turkana share dry season
pastures with the Toposa and Nyangatom, who are also pastoralists. Some Turkana people stay permanently in the Ilemi triangle, which is formed by the
borders of Kenya, Sudan and Ethiopia. This area is Sudanese territory, but
is presently under Kenyan administration. In this area the Turkana compete
for grazing grounds with the Toposa and Nyangatom äs well äs with the (Cushitic) Dasanetch, who are known äs Marille (/ni -mar^-le/) to the Turkana. Thepresenting a general overview of the language, with specific questions being
treated in more detail, because they pose special problems for the field of
Nilotic studies and because they are particularly complicated. Such problems
are: gender, case, number, the verb morphology and word order.
Throughout the study reference is made to the comparative Status of various phenomena in an attempt to enlighten their historical Status, without,
however, trying to use comparative evidence for synchronic analysis.
It is hoped that this monograph is of some interest for the general linguist äs well. Although the study is data-oriented, and although its purpose
is not to prove or disprove particular theoretical issues, some aspects of
Turkana such äs non-voiced vowels, vowel harmony, prominence hierarchies and the
number marking System may be of more general linguistic interest.
Throughout the description reference is made to such variant culturallyrelated topics äs colour terminology, ox-naming, tree names, proverbs andborders on the south are also not very strict.
The dosest linguistic affiliations of Turkana are with the neighbouring
languages Karimojong, Jie, Toposa and Nyangatom (the Jiye of Sudan speakonomastics. The study of these topics was started out of sheer interest in
the traditional culture of the Turkana people. The topics turned out to be
linguistically significant after all, because of their idiosyncrasies of formToposa). Although these languages are spoken by ethnically distinct groups,
they are all mutually intelligible with Turkana. They mainly differ frorn each
other with regard to tone. Turkana together with these languages constitutesand meaning, and, therefore, they have been included in this grammar. They
may also serve ultimately äs instances of the 'ethnography of speaking"" for
the interest of anthropologists wishing to study the culture of one of thea group, with the Teso language of Uganda, often referred to äs the Teso
group. The Teso group is part of the Eastern Nilotic branch of Nilotic,last traditional peoples of Africa.
The study concentrates on the central dialect of Turkana, which coverswhich in turn is one of the ten branches of the Eastern Sudanic language
most of the area occupied by the tribe. Dialectal Variation is found in the
family according to Greenberg (1966:86) .
Earlier accounts of Turkana are to be found in Johnston (1902:885-935),
Barton (1921), Hulley (1923), Ernley (1927). One particular study, writtenareas bordering on other languages, due to interference from these neighbouring languages. Because of a lack of transportation facilities no proper
dialect survey could be carried out, although incidental trips were made toby a person without linguistic training, deserves special attention, i.e.

Although it does not distinguish all vowels proper to Turkana (nor is tone
indicated), it points out various irregulär forms and idiosyncrasies of Turkana. (The author of the present study did not have access to another sketch
prepared by a missionary working in the Turkana area, that of Kelly (1969).)
Recently, two studies dealing with aspects of Turkana have appeared, i.e.in the southwestern part of the Turkana area, mainly along the upper Turkwell river. These people are hunter-gatherers traditionally, though they
also practice some agriculture. Although the people can only remember that
their ancestors were Turkana, there are indications that their ancestors were
early Nilotic agriculturalists who lived in the area before the Turkana movedPolley and Jeffrey (1977), concentrating on phonological aspects of the language, and Heine (1980), which gives a broad overview of the language.
The primary aim of the present description is to communicate information
about an insufficiently known Nilotic language for the purpose of compara-in (cf. Lamphear, 1968). The root /.-Iboot/ means 'to be without cattle, to
be poor', äs these people do not own cattle.
The sections below summarize the most important topics of the chapters
given hereafter. Chapter 2 presents an outline of the phonological componenttive Nilotic studies. An attempt has been made to write a reference granmar,of Turkana. Phonological ruies are discussed mainly to the extent relevant
for an understanding of the morphology and syntax of the language. Three
topics are treated in a more detailed manner, because they turned out to be
crucial for the discussion of other problems dealt with in subsequent chapters. These are: vowel harmony, tone and syllable structure.
Chapter 3 sets out to describe a framework for a discussion of basic and
derived sentences in the language. An attempt is made on the basis of a grammatical model akin to, but not strictiy following the Functional Grammar pa-syntactic node to which sentence level adverbs may be attached is also used
for noun phrases that are topicalized or demoted, äs well äs for questionwords. This node thus functions äs the 'front-porch' or the 'back-porch' for
various syntactic categories.
Contrastive emphasis of the various major syntactic categories is dealt
with in chapter 8. It is also shown that a special technique occurs for verb
strengthening. This technique is distinct from the System used for emphasis
of other syntactic categories.
Interrogative and negative sentences are discussed in chapter 9. Theyradigm, to relate categorial structure to functional notions like subject

predisposition for topic-comment relations.

on the basis of a prominence hierarchy.
Chapter 4 gives a synopsis of the central element of the language: theincluded, since an extensive list of basic vocabulary is to be found in Heine (1980:84-96).
A number of problems not dealt with here remain to be investigated, suchverb. It disousses basic formal and functional properties of verbs. The various components of the verb form such äs person, number, tense, aspect and

thereby affecting the inherent semantic properties of verbs, äs well äs theäs: (l) the distribution of tense vowels, (2) the tonology of the verb, and

these problems, much more research is required with regard to these issues.
Some of the observations and proposals made may be regarded äs somewhatargument structure of verbs. No attempt has been made at formalizing the tonoiogy of the verb.
Chapter 5 discusses the noun phrase. The structure of the noun and its
features related to gender and number are treated in detail. Deverbative
nouns are discussed here, äs are pronouns. This chapter also treats case
marking (by way of tone) and modifiers like demonstratives, numerais and
relative clauses. The section on relative clauses constitutes a major part
of chapter 5. An attempt is made to show that the internal structure of aspeculative by the reader. This partly reflects uncertainty about the linguistic Status of these phenomena. It is hoped that the study provides enough data for alternative analyses. If the reader feels tempted to present

to be more common: /a -ta-aba'7 (Singular) , /qa-taba-b'/ (pluml) . The etymo-The various types of adjuncts, i.e. adverbial constructions that show

"55Chapter 3The noun phrase(s) bear(s) a specific semantic (or case) relation to the
verb. The semantic role is not an inherent property of the noun phrase, butSentence Structureis part of the composition plan of the verb. The type of semantic roles needed
is presented in the section following this one. The case relations are built
on top of an explicit categorial framework consisting of a verb (V) and one
or more noun phrases (NP's). The positions of syntactic constituents like
subject, direct object and indirect object in a sentence are determined by the3.1. The notion basic sentence
The term 'basic sentence' can be looked at from at least two points of view:
(a) From the point of view of 'pragmatics', in that a specific sentence
is marked for a certain context in which it can be used. With regard
to basic sentences, unmarked for any context, a distinction can be
made between simple (or 'kernel', or 'atomic') sentences, and 'extended' (or 'compiex') ones. The latter are more complex from a syn-semantic roles performed by these constituents, äs shown in section 3.7.
Verbs, furthermore, have inherent semantic features. They are either action
verbs, process verbs or Stative verbs. These inherent properties are discussed
in section 4.4. As section 3.2.1. below shows, this determines how a noun
phrase modifying the verb is to be interpreted (äs an Agentive etc.).
The core can be modified by various types of adjuncts, introduced in sectio
3.5. below. This can be represented äs follows in a tree-diagram:tactic point of view. Basic sentences below are first looked at from
a syntactic point of view, and then in section 3.2.3. pragmatic functions
dealing with topicalization of constituents and emphasis are introduced.
(b) From the point of view of predicate structure, which can be a basic
or a derived structure. Verbs have a basic and a derived predicate frame,
i.e. the intrinsic properties of verbs can be modified, thereby affecting
their argument structures among other things. This process is described
in section 4.9.2.
Turkana is a verb-initial language. As is argued below, Turkana is also a
verb-prominent language, i.e. the verb is the central element of the sentence.
Each verb has a specific 'composition plan', indicating the number of noun
phrases it may take, among other things. Verbs can be classified äs 'one-place'
verbs, 'two-place' verbs and 'three-place' verbs in this way. With regard to
simple sentences, constituting the core (CO) of any syntactic structure, aThe syntactic node S', which dominates the core and the adjunctival node
is itself the central part of the syntactic node S. The Symbol S Stands for
a syntactic structure consisting of S', and preceded or followed by a syntactic node here referred to by the term COMP, which Stands for 'complenent'.
Syntactic structures of this type are calied 'extended sentences'.
The syntactic node COMP is used for sentence level adverbs, äs well äs
for noun phrases and other constituents that have been removed from the coredistinction occurs between 'verbal sentences' and 'non-verbal' sentences, atsentence. Extended and derived sentences of this type are introduced inleast on the surface. The core of a verbal sentence consists of an initialsection 3.6. below. The structure can be represented äs follows:verb, either Standing on its own, or followed by one, two or three noun phrases:
SThis chapter only introduces some syntactic aspects of the verb and its
predicate frame. Further morphological and syntactic Information on what
probably is the most complex part of Turkana grammar, the verb and its func-• S56
but in order to motivate such a choice, various 'surface phenomena' need totions, is given in chapter 4.
Non-verbal sentences have the following internal structure:be accounted for first. The main problem is (äs shown in section 3.6. below)
that the subject noun phrase does not necessarily occur next to the verb,
or in sentence-final position. VOS (verb-object-sübject) is also a basic word
order pattern in the language, not being marked for any specific context.
This implies that the subject noun phrase cannot be determined on the basis(AUX)NPNP(AUX Stands for 'auxiliary verb' in the tree-diagram.)
Although the core can be preceded or followed by a complement (COMP) in
the case of a non-verbal sentence, this Situation rarely obtains.
No Claim is made here that the presentation of the basic sentence structure of Turkana in this grarnmar corresponds to any deep structure level of
the language. It is probably more accurate to call it 'shallow structure'.
The latter does not necessarily represent the abstract underlying structure.
Its purpose is simply to present a framework that makes it possible to refer
basic and derived sentences in a unified way.
Complex sentences tend to have a less elaborate System of tense and aspectual distinctions. They also tend to be more conservative from a diachronic
point of view. Thus, to take one example, with negation in complex verbal
sentences in Turkana the old Niio-Saharan negative marker {ma-} only occurs
in a restricted environment (see section 9.2.6.) . Core sentences tend to
have a more elaborate System of negation distinctions. These core sentences,
therefore, are more innovative. Given the historical-comparative purpose of
this grammar, the distinctions drawn above thus also provide a frame of reference for the historical dynamism of the various grammatical aspects treated.
This study does not follow any specific syntactic or morphological theory,
although an attempt has been made to present a clear-cut sentence structure.
The author has been influenced by ideas expressed in Case grammar äs developed
by Pillmore and others (see e.g. Fillmore (1968, 1971, 1976), R. M. Newman
(1971)), Furthermore, Functional grammar äs developed by Dik (1978, 1980) has
been influential. As a model of language it is very much like Case grammar.
For some points of convergence and divergence see e.g. Lachlan Mackenzie
(1980). The main advantage of such modeis is that there is no assumption of
a sequence 'NP VF' (or 'VP NP'), or 'NP Predicate phrase'. For a verb-initial
language like Turkana this would imply an ad hoc transformation moving the
initial (subject) noun phrase into a Position following the verb. Such a
transformation may be required 'in a deep-structure analysis of the language,of the syntactic configuration developed along the lines of Chomsky (1965),
since the constituents belonging to the verb-phrase (VP) are discontinuous
in Turkana, at least in surface structures with VSO word order. As both VSO
and VOS word order occur, the subject function, which is explicitly marked
in Turkana, cannot be determined on the basis of its position with regard
to the verb. This means that recourse is to be taken to other notions, in
order to be able to determine and predict the syntactic functions of noun
phrases which are explicitly marked.
The Turkana data suggest that semantic roles o£ noun phrases are relevant i
word order .Semantic roles are probably best studied within the framework
of Case grammar and of Functional grammar. As stated above, the main advantage of these modeis is that there is no assumption of a strict 'NP VP'
(or 'VP NP') order in the base. The lack of a clear-cut syntactic framework
in these modeis is probably also one of their weaknesses. The position taken
by the author of this grammar is that both a clear-cut syntactic framework,
äs well äs semantic notions like Ägentive are needed in order to account for
a verb-initial language like Turkana. In comparing Turkana with another verbinitial language which belongs to the Southern Nilotic branch of Nilotic,
Nandi, various differences can be found, concerning the structure of nonverbal sentences, the position of the subject and question words, raising
and other phenomena. However, the same observations can be made about the
Status of the subject noun phrase in both languages:
(a) Many sentences are subjectiess, i.e. the subject noun phrase is an
omissible syntactic constituent (see section 3.3.4.).
(h) The subject is explicitly marked by way of case inflection through
tone, whereas the direct object and indirect object are unmarked
for case, i.e. they occur in the absolute case.
(c) The transitive relation between the verb and the direct object (and,
less commoniy, between the verb and the indirect object, or prepositional phrase) is important at the logical level with various constructions, e.g. with nominalisations äs shown in section 5.4.2.","[35, 36, 37]"

accounted for in a theory of such morphological processes.
Turkana has very few compounds, äs the discussion in 5.4.5. illustrates.

into a resultative. If it is changed into an inchoative form, it cannot be changed into a resultative form. If completion is to be indicated, this is done with the means available to basic dynamic verbs,
i.e. by way of the regulär perfective (aspect) markers.
(b) A dynamic verb can be changed into a habituative form, and then in-4.9.2.1. Factitive
The factitive verb form is based on a dynamic verb root. Most often, the
construction expresses a generic state. It only occurs äs a distinct verb
form with simple verbs. With complex (derived) verbs, the construction of
this type may also have a resultative meaning, the two types not being
distinguished. For a description of the latter see the next section.
The factitive also occurs in other Eastern Nilotic languages. Tucker
and Mpaayei (1955) have suggested various names for this type of construction: 'neuter-passive', 'quasi-passive' or 'reflexive-reciprocal'. As in
Maasai, the construction takes the Stative voice marker {-a }. Accordingly,
the verb construction has the same form äs transitive verbs of state äs
presented in section 4.9.1.1.
As in Maasai the construction has a connotated, or implied meaning of
some generic state directed towards oneself, or for one's own benefi,t, theto an inchoative. However, if it is changed into a resultative form,resulting state having been accomplished by the subject itself. Tucker andit caimot be changed into an affective form. Affective verb forms areMpaayei (1955:135) note with regard to Maasai that the verb forms ''expressonly used in order to be able to express an indirect object withthe state a person or object gets into without the help of an outside agen-Stative verbs.

One thus notes that in the first case the reason has to do with the ten-se-aspect distinctions in the language, whereas in the second case it hasto do with argument structures of verbs.
Specific verb forms, presented in the sections below, which are basical-ly Stative in meaning, but which have the internal structure of affectiveforms (like ' to be lonely', äs one of the examples) no longer have asimpler form that is used. Also verb forms occur, that are basically dy-namic in meaning, but which have the internal structure of a habituativeverb form (like ' to be industrious' , äs one of the examples) without(1) a-yEn-^ a-yoq

groupe-bun-it
3-come-A'then he saw a group (of warriors) coming his way'4.9.2.2. Resultative
Resultative verb forms are based on transitive dynamic verbs. (Factitive
verb forms are based either on transitive or intransitive verbs.) They indicate a specific state in which some entity which functions äs the direct
object or indirect object in the corresponding dynamic verb construction
occurs. Although the resultative form may have functioned äs a passive form
with Stative meaning originally, it synchronically no longer functions äs
such. Contrary to the factitive, there is the connotated meaning of an external factor having produced the result, nevertheless.
Witih regard to the resultative a distinction is to be made between (a)
simple verbs and derived verbs used in active voice, and (b) reflexive or
reciprocal verbs, which are rendered in middle voice in dynamic verb constructions with regard to the way the resultative is formed.ni-kei]

In example (l) the derived subject noun phrase occurs in the nominative

As the resultatives are Stative, only [+past] and [-past] are distinguished.

forms already indicate a perfective form, One example based on the past tense:

(4)a-sak-'i a-yogReflexive verbs are always based on transitive verbs in Turkana. Howeveri-yon' i-ar-'iI-want-AIWyouäs noted in section 3.9., reflexive predicate structures only contain oneyou-klll-Anoun phrase. When such constructions occur in a Subordinate clause, the verb•I want you to kill (it)'is obligatorily rendered äs a conjugated form. This syntactic behaviour reThus, in the last sentence the subject of the main clause and the subordinate clause are not the same. Accordingly, the verb of the Subordinate
clause is conjugated. One further example of a Subordinate clause with a
raised subject:quires further investigation-(For an analysis see Dimmendaal (1983).)
Below, further examples are given with cornnlementizing verbs followed by
a subordinate clause with or without a raised subject noun phrase. Whether
the noun phrase is raised depends on whether it is definite and'animate.(5)to-ryam-^ gesi a-pa' keg' e-mamu

(Note also that raised subjects occur in the absolute case, because they
precede the verb of the clause in which they function äs a subject.)
The verb Infinitive which occurs in the Subordinate clause can be active
(both transitive and intransitive), äs shown above, or it can occur äs an
Infinitive form with impersonal active meaning, äs in the next example:

A second type of clause following complementizing verbs is introducedby the subordinatinq element ""thaf . This element is used when an other
than gerundive meaning is expressed by the verb form in the subordinate
clause, äs in the example below:Subordinate clauses may also indicate a purpose. If the prupose of some

it may contain an embedded subordinate clause:

"3.6. Extended sentences'The term extended sentence is used here in a syntactic sense. An extended
sentence consists of a basic S', preceded or followed by a phrase here
termed complement (COMP), äs illustrated in the first part of this chapter.
Although the basic (s') mostly contains a verb, it is nevertheless possible to have a basic sentence (S') consisting of a non-verbal sentence,
preceded or followed by COMP.
Phrases occurring under COMP are extended (or non-nuclear) arguments to3.5. Ädjuncts
The unmarked position of adjunctival phrases within a sentence is after thethe main predication in Turkana. The following categories can be found under
the heading COMP:verb and the core noun phrases. Various types of adjuncts (some of which
are mutually exclusive) occur in this syntactic slot: locatives, manner
phrases, instrument phrases and others. Sübordinate clauses can also be
generated under the heading adjuncts by recursion of the category S'.(a) Simple adverbs of place and time, äs well äs adverbial phrases with

One example of an irregulär

itiveverb roota-limw-or^'confess'(root absent)a-kokoy-arj;'steal away'-koko 'steal'In addition, the marker also has a more aspectual function, that of indicating retrospective meaning, i.e. the opposite of what the ventive renders äs a derived :meaning. The fact that the itive and ventive are alsomer mostly occurs with transitive verbs, whereas the latter generally occurs
with intransitive verbs, but there are exceptions. The form of the dative
verb rootextension in the Infinitive is {-kin^} (with two allomorphs depending on(root absent)the vowel harmony). With öonjugated verbs, the-following allomorphs occur:-koko 'steal'/-kin/, /-km/, /-k^/ and /-k^/. (The distinction between the two corresponding [+ATR] and [-ATR] vowels is determined by the regulär vowel harmony ruies of the language.)
Below, first regulär examples are presented (in the Infinitive):found with this function in defective verb paradigms (see chapter 10), and
that they may also have this function in other Eastern Nilotic languages
like Maasai suggests that this System was more elaborate at an earlier stage.
The extended use of the markers indicating direction is more common (Miller
(1972). Compare for instance the case of French, where the verbs 'to come'
and ' to go ' are used to indicate respectively retrospective' and prospective meaning:
'Je viens d'ecrire une lettre' (I just wrote a letter)

As can be seen from these examples, the constructions with a dative ex-Thus the System found in Turkana is exactiy the opposite of the one found

Two examples are given below. The first
one concerns a factitive construction, the second one contains a resultative
verb. Note that the verb in the second example forms the counterpart inentities.
As with the basic Stative verbs with a habitual extension, there is anthing Walternation between the number marker { -n} in the Singular and the marker {-k} in the plural. Clauses expression a habituative show up commonalities with non-verbal sehtences discussed in section 3.4., because of the
word order, and because of the fact that most often one does not find any
complement (COMP) expressed.

a-to-'I have been overtaken by the night'4.9.3. The subsecutive •mood
A widespread feature of Nilotic languages is the use of what is called here
the subsecutive mood. This verb form mainly occurs in Subordinate clauses,
or the second of two co-ordinated clauses. Crazzolara (1933) has described
this verb type for Nuer, a Western Nilotic language. Höre recently, Noonan
and Bavin (1981) have described the syntax and semantics of this verb construction for Lango, another Western Nilotic language.
The subsecutive mood with verbs differs from the indicative in a number
of ways, at least in the affirmative:
(a) Tense marking is absent. Although most often the verb has past tense
meaning, äs can be grasped from the context (see various examples below), this is not explicitly indicated. In the closely related lan-tion see Tucker and Mpaayei (1955:53).
(b) The specific set of agreement markers is completely different from the
set found with the indicative, conditional, exclamative or subjunctivesingulara-to-a-a-to-ki-ki-to-to-kl-kl-forms, in order to keep it distinct from the first person Singular. Whenever
a first person Singular or plural functions äs a direct object or indirect
object, and a third person occurs äs the subject, the marker {k-} is prefixed to these first person prefixes, but not to the second person prefixes.
Apart from the different set of person markers that is used, no major differences occur with the indicative in terms of aspect, voice, number or otherwise. However, in order to indicate an imperfective form the root or stem
of the verb is used without any aspect marking, äs shown by the following
examples:
(1)^-ä-bu' to-to-n
3-PA-come 3-dead-sg
•then he died'
(2)e-ä-pot^ to-to-k-a^
3-PA-come 3-dead-pl-pl

(3)a-to-pol-o-t'(with some exceptions for the latter), but identical (apart from theI-big-V-sgtone) with the set used with the imperative (where tense marking is'and I was big'also absent). In the negative this distinction is neutralized between(4)käpe^ to-lot'gopluralto-in the subsecutive the first person plural patterns with the other pluralguage Maasai this specific verb form has become the general form

When Suffixes are added to the stem, they are either (inherently) weak
or strong. When they are weak, their surface forms with regard to vowel
harmony can be predicted on the basis of ruie P-6 above. However, a number
of Suffixes are strong themselves. They trigger off vowel harmony on the
stem (and the prefix) after vowel harmony ruies have applied within theTwo complications occur, however, with dominant Suffixes with [-ÄTR]
vowels. The first one occurs when such a dominant suffix contains a vowel
/o/ or /e/, and is suffixed to a root (i.e. without any derivational suffixes
occurring between the two) with a vowel /o/ or /e/. In that case, the vowel
harmony is blocked, in that a semi-vowel /y/ in inserted between them, in
order to fulfill the structure conditions of the language. Thus:a-k-item-et ->• a-k-item-y-et 'attempt'stem (and on the prefix). Accordingly, one needs a ruie by which all vowels

Suffixes with [+ATR] vowels in Maasai seem to trigger off vowel harmony2.3.3. Tense vowels
In languages like Turkana tongue root advancing seems to praduce a wide pharynx and, possibly äs an articulatory correlate, breathy vowels. [-ATR] vowels
in Turkana sound tense, or harsh. This is the general pattern observable in
the language, but in addition the vowels /o/ and /e/ sound harsh in specific
examples, and in specific environments. These tense vowels do not have a
phonemic Status, since they are predictable, at least in those cases where28they have been noted. The tense mid vowels are indicated phonetically as
[e] and [o]. Synchronic and diachronic evidence suggests that the tense(1976:24) reconstructs such tense mid vowels for the common ancestor of the
(neighbouring) Kuliak languages. Furthermore, Tucker and Mpaayei (1955:241)
notice for Maasai that if the stem vowel is /e/ or /o/, or /i/ or /u/ whichvowels have two sources:come from /i/, or /u/, the high front vowel of the plural gender prefix pho-(a) From a [-ATR] vowel which has become [+ATR] in the immediate environment of a glide (which shares specific features with [+ATB] vowels) :-iryo -@ [try?!lbe

items, and they are indicated as such wherever appropriate.)netically is somewhere between /i/ and /i/. From this it is clear that in
Maasai vowel harmony is involved, as is the case in Turkana.
Tense vowels have been reported by Ladefoged (1971:14) for Teso (Eastern
Nilotic) and Lango (Western Nilotic). With regard to these vowels Ladefoged
notices that ""..the arytenoids are pressed inward so that the posterior portions of the vocal cords are held together and only the anterior ligamental(b) From a sequence of a high front vowel (or a glide /y/) plus a vowel

apparatus for the production of [-ATR] vowels, while a [+ATR] vowel is beingproduced.","[20, 21, 22, 23]"

Variation frequently occurs.
The verb root is followed by the Stative voice marker {-a}.

are to be distinguished, which occur in a mutually exclusive context:

In conjugated forms of such verbs, two basic patters occur: a Stative pa-Examples like the one with the verb ' to roast (in a ceremönial way) '
above suggest that (historically at least) some of these verbs are due to 'PP (prepositional) raising', i.e. they indicate(d) that some complement phrase
has been raised to the position of direct object, a process which is not possible synchronically in Turkana.
When the transitive ingressive verb is followed by a direct object in the
Infinitive, the instrumental (subjunctive) marker is replaced by the ventive
extension. As noted in section 4.5.3., the ventive is also used to indicate
prospective meaning. Some examples:tern, with forms conjugated äs Stative verbs presented in section 4.9.1.1.,a-k-lpey-o-re'welcome (somebody)'and a dynamic pattern, analogous to process verbs.

verbs have the most extensive basic verb conjugqtion, äs the following examples (from a much longer list, if mood is taken into account) show. The
forms all occur in the indicative mood:

'he almost died'becomes a class 2 verb. This shift of morphological class is in fact a common feature of causative formation with verbs in those Nilotic languages thahave morphological verb classes referred to äs class 1/2 verbs.
The form of the causative marker does not depend on whether the verb is
conjugated or occurs in the Infinitive, neither does its form depend on the
mood of the verb form.

Moreover, the fact that the direct object function with part-wholeThe importance of the notion 'participant in Speech', 'participant in adialogue' has been argued for in a number of studies. In the field of Africanlinguistics, the study by Schadeberg (1977) on this notion in Bantu languagesshould be mentioned. Turkana and other Nilotic languages further show the rele-vance of this concept, especially in the field of agreement marking.constructions behaves in the same way äs those that are clearly basic suggests
that these constructions are to be analyzed äs basic sentence types without
any movement ruie.
With regard to number marking (in Order to distinguish Singular and plural
forms), a distinction can be made between:Examples presented so far are with basic predicates äs defined in chapter3. Noun phrases can be rdised'from a Subordinate clause iato the matrix clause
(äs described in section 6.9.). Although in that case they occupy the positionaf direct object in the matrix clause, they still function äs subjects of theSubordinate clause. This becomes clear from the lack of object agreement whena participant occurs äs a raised constituent:
a-sak-'i a-yog
I-want-AI (N)you-go-Awhere plurals are.
(b) Constructions where both the Singular and the plural are marked with
a number suffix.
The first person plural verb form is distinct from the first person singulari-yon' i-los-1 lo-dwar^
you(a) Constructions where Singular forms are not marked for number, butLodwar'I want you to go to Lodwar'
In the example above, the second person Singular is raised. As the raisingi-s a derived function (determined by the prominence hierarchy), no agreementbecause of the person marker, except with the subsecutive mood, and a few verb
constructions with indicative mood. In those cases where it is distinct, it
patterns with the Singulars, in that no number suffix is required. In those
cases where it is not distinct, it patterns with the second and third person
plural, in that it takes a plural number suffix. This principle could becalled 'the principle of least efforf.and [-ATR], it could be treated äs an allomorph of {-t-o}.","[71, 72]"
"As the examples above illustrate, there is no restriction on the use of
the negative marker {jii-} , äs regards the formal or semantic features of
the verb (simple versus derived, and state versus process, or action), or
voice. The marker can only be used, however, in a context in which the nega-9.2.1.

Each of these four typesstate of affairs is particularly stressed, or where negation constitutes the
'theme' of the utterance, the nother negativer marker, {pe-}, is used, äsof constructions is discussed below.
The first type of negative constructions discussed is based on the imperfective (l) form (for which see section 4.9.1.). The prefixation of the
negative marker {jl i -} involves considerable tonal restructuring of the verb
form. This restructuring is not further discussed here. Below, sentences are
presented in which this negative marker occurs, illustrating its use with
simple and derived verbs, with the different voices that occur. Examples:

As the examples above show, the negative marker is used in order to focus{-a}, which has an extended function, that of aspect marker, äs noted
in chapter 4.
(c) The underlying subject is demoted to the complement (COMP) node, and,
accordingly, occurs in the absolute (unmarked) case.
(d) Regardless of whether a plural or singular noun occurs äs the (derived) subject, the verb is not inflected for number.
A further, syntactic, complication occurs, in that the demoted noun phrase
occurring äs a complement, has to precede the (derived) subject. This phenome.
