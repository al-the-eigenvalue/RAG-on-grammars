rules for the form of the genitive morpheme itself, the feminine -t- before it, and

There are two classes of postposition, according to their position relative to a

inseparable ones are the following ¥:
~’b(zero before a pronoun suffix): ‘in, about”;
(/'t/ before a pronoun suffix): like’;
(/s/ before a pronoun suffix): from, by”.
This last postposition may be followed by the morpheme -ka- (Which follows the
’
pronoun suffix), and the meaning is then either than or since’.

****a5. PRONOUNSPossessive pronoun suffixes5.1Possessive pronoun suffixes are added to the noun that refers to what is
possessed (e.g. /2i-gaw-uu-'k/* your (""k) house’). The noun to which a possessive
suffix is added may or may not have a definite article as well (cf. /gaw-uu-'k/
*a house of yours”). Before the possessive suffix there is a marker of case and
number, namely one of the vowels which also occur in the definite article (see3.3c):Nominative
AccusativeSingular(/Ygawewu-""k(/ Yinsgaw-00~""ePlural/
//Tiegaweaa-aa-'k
(/Ti-gaw-na-ee-""k/
/Before the case/number marker there is the feminine marker -t- if the noun isfeminine (¢.g. /ti-huus-aa-t-aa-’k/‘your knives’).
The possessive pronoun suffixes are as follows :Ist personi/t/*SingularPlural/a/2nd person

/*hiena/

Ifa genitive marker (see 4.1) is added to a noun containing a possessive pronoun
suffix, it must precede both the pronoun suffix and also the case /number marker
(/au/, /o0/, /aa/, /ee/ or /i/}—but not the feminine -t- belonging to the noun-root
or the plural marker -a- (e.g. /ti-?oor-t-ii-wu-’k/ your daughter's ""). However,

is a child of theirs), and /'s/ is found, as both singular and plural, after a numeral or an
ronominal root (see 5.3 below) and before the copular’clitic (e.g. /bar-wn-'k
“sew-a/* You (bar-uu-'k) are (ewea) him (bar-o0~')"").ag/h/Artaarz124R. A. HUDSON—
a case-number marker and (where relevant) a feminine -t- must also be addedto the genitive (according to the normal rules for concord in modifiers given in 3),to show concord with the second possessed noun (e.g. sons in your daughter's,
sons’). This concord is shown by the vowels before the pronoun suffix (/au/ etc.)
and the feminine +- after the genitive marker -F or -e (e.g. /ti-Roortii--aa-k 2ét/
“your daughter (ti-Poor-t. .. 'k)'s daughters (?ar)’, where -t-aa- shows feminine
plural nominative concord with ?ax). In other words, the pronoun suffix is
suffixed not only by the genitive morpheme
separated from the noun to which it
but also by the feminine -t- and case-number marker which show concord with
the noun possessed by this noun.
Similarly, if an inseparable postposition (see 4.2) is attached to a noun that
has possessive pronoun suffix the postposition comes first (¢.g. /ti-?oor-bii-s-oo-'k/
“from (-s-) your daughter’). In this case, however, the case-number marker
shows concord with the noun to which the possessive suffix is attached. (If the
-t- like ’, the possessive pronoun suffix has the form given
5.3
Postposition
below for object pronoun suffixes, as in /wi-?oorti-'t-hook/ ‘like your son ’.)
Possessive pronoun suffixes are also used to translate ‘ than me and so on:
they are suffixed to -ka- ‘ more ’, which is itself suffixed to adjective roots (and
relative clauses), and the possessive suffix again is preceded by the appropriate
case-number marker (and feminine -t-) required by the adjective or relative clause
(e.g. /dabalo-""kaa-t-oo-""k ?oor/ ‘a girl smaller (dabalo-""kaa-t-oo-) than you (‘k);
/Nisktden-hedb-kaa-t-o0-'k 2oor/ ‘a girl who knows (ticktden-) me (-heéd-) more

Complete elision of final unstressed short vowels seems more common in Beni Amer and
Hadendowa than in Arteiga.anThe accent system basically involves simply a distinction between accented
Arteiga,be14R. A, HUDSONand unaccented syllables, where accent’ is realized phonetically as a relatively
high pitch. However, contrary to the claims of Reinisch (1893: 55) (cf. also
Almkvist, 1881: 57), a single word may contain more than one accented syllable
(e.g. /ké-tam-a-'n/ ‘I don’t eat’), since the unit of distribution for accents is the
accent-unit, not the word (Hudson, 1973b). An accent-unit is a sequence of one
‘or more complete morphemes, comprising at least one syllable, within which only
‘one accented syllable is permitted ; that
if more than one of
morphemes
has an inherent accent (indicated in the dictionary of morphemes), only one of
these inherent accents can be realized (e.g. in /tam-a-n-ee-'k/ ‘if I ate’, both
~'n- ‘1’ and ~’k-* if"" have inherent accents, but since both are in the same accentunit only one accent can be realized,
this case that of ~'k-; cf. /tam-a-'n/* Tate’).
In general, the principle underlying the choice of accent
be realized is that the
later of two inherent accents in the same accent-unit
realized.
‘is,theinistothe realized accent is determined by the word's
morphological structure, and is not predictable (pace Reinisch, 1893: 55 and
Almkvist, 1881 : 57) from its purely phonological structure (e.g. /ti-rib-'a/ ‘ you
refused ', but /ti-dif-a/ you went’, whose roots belong to different accentual
classes but are otherwise morphologically the same). A morpheme may or may
not have an inherent accent, but
it does, there are two further variables to be
specified : the position of the accentual reference-point (usually on a vowel in the
last syllable of the morpheme) and
position of the accented vowel relative
to this reference-point, allowing us to speak of final accent (on the referencepoint itself) and penultimate accent (on the syllable—or mora—before the
reference-point). For simplicity we can show these two variables together in
the transcription, by using for final accent and for penultimate accent, and
locating these accent-marks on the reference-point itself Thus, /kitiab/*a book”
has phonetic high pitch on the first syllable, although this pitch is indicated by
the penultimate accent-mark on the second
syllable. By convention, the accentual
reference-point can be taken as the vowel over which the accent-mark is written,
if there is such a vowel, and as the first vowel to the left of the accent-mark if
there is not; this allows the accentual influence of a morpheme

over several other morphemes (e.g. in /ticrib-'a/ ‘you refused, the accent is
determined by the third morpheme,
reference-point
on the vowel of the
second morpheme, and
realization, as high pitch, is on the first morpheme)..
The position and nature of

there is no such vowel, then the high pitch is located on the vowel acting as

The third result is phonetically the same as the result which is always produced
by a final accent (e.g. /k*aa-'-t/ ‘a sister), and the difference is seen only when
a prefix is added to which the realization of the penultimate accent can be
transferred (¢.g. /2uu-yias/* the dog’, with high pitch on the prefix).

only one
sentence, but there may be several C’s, including direct objects, objects of
causation, indirect objects, and predicative complements. The normal order ofper‘elements is :SOVie. any C’s come between the S and the verb (V). The following are typical:examples/oar-uue'k 2araaw-oo~'n tickteen-'a/ ‘You (bar-uu-'k) know (ti-kteen-'a) a friend
of ours (?araaw-00-'n) °.
/oar-uu-' Yaraaw-oo-'n ki-t-'a/* You aren’t (k-t-t'a) a friend of ours’
(/bar-uu-'k ?araaw-oo-'n mhalag-aa-""b ti-niiw-a/ ‘ You give (ti-ntiw-a) a friend ofours money (mbalag-aa-b)""‘'a/ ‘You cause-to-collect (ti-s
(/bar-uu-'k araaw-oo-'n mhalag-aa-""b ti-s-dat
dabiil~a) a friend of ours money’.
Similarly, postpositional constructions (4.2), adverbial clauses (10) and other
adverbial constructions occur before the verb, though they may not be as restricted
positionally as are $ and C. According to Reinisch (1893: 73) the agent in a
passive construction (2.4, 7.7) occurs with the postposition which normally
(e.g. /wichada-’ Yi-yaas-ii-’ 2i-too-déar/
means from ’, and is put between S and
“the lion (wichada-') was killed (2i-too-déar) by the dog (i-yaas-ii-’)’),
The verb shows concord with the subject in person, number and gender (7.2),
and no subject is in fact necessary—for instance,
the sentences listed in the
‘
with
could
have had no subject
previous paragraph
/bar-uu-’k/ you’ as subject
at all with no change in either grammaticality or meaning, beyond a change of
emphasis. The complement—or rather one of the complements—may be represented by a suffix attached to the verb (5.3), and again if such a suffix is present
one is understood semantically (e.g. /ti-kteenno separate C is needed even
“arhedb/* You know (ti-kteen-""a-) me (-hedb) °), The 3rd-person complement suffixesV‘allif1116R. A. HUDSONhave no realization, except under rather special grammatical circumstances, so
there may be no overt reflex at all of a complement that is understood (e.g.
/Aickteen-'a/ You know him/her /it/them *).
The order S-C-V given above
only the normal order, from which deviations
and
are possible
quite common, apparently for reasons of emphasis and the like.
However, this is more true of main clauses than of subordinate clauses, since in
the latter the verb is almost always the last element, due to the rule that any
subordinating markers, corresponding
subordinating conjunctions in English,
take the form of suffixes added directly to the verb (9, 10); since this suffix really
is natural for it to be kept on the edge
the whole clause,

*isitto2.2.toofPredicative constructionsIn predicative constructions, the element referred to as ‘the verb’, and
represented in the formula above by V, may be either a proper verb (viz. a form
‘
of the irregular verb
be ’) or a ‘ copular clitic’ (6), based on the morpheme
-a-, which also means be’, but having a completely different kind of paradigm
from verbs. These two sets of forms are in complementary distribution: the
clitics are used in sentences that are positive, present tense and not embedded in
another sentence (i.e. in the most straightforward kinds of sentence), and the
verbs are used in all other kinds
sentence. Compare the following for instance :
‘ He
small (dabaloo-'-b=)
/dabaloo-’-beu/
/Aabaloo-'-b 7i-kti/ He used to be (2ii-ktt) small
/Aabaloo~=b i’-li-ké/ He isn’t small °
/Aabaloo-’-b ?i-katii-ee-""k/ ‘ If he is small’
In some respects the copular clitic is like a suffix: for instance, it causes
preceding short vowels to lengthen, and can even impose its own accent on the
is in the same accent-unit. On the other hand, it is
complement, showing that
less closely attached to the complement than a suffix would be: for instance, it
does not count as a syllable of the complement noun as far as the rule that
determines the length of the article is concerned (3.3c). Moreover,
has its own
internal structure, consisting of from one to three morphemes (¢.g. /t-oo-ndees't(e'-uw-y) the mother (-oo-ndees) ’), rather
uu-y/ ‘You (fem.) are
more like an
independent verb. The grammatical status of a copular clitic is thus ambiguous
between that of an affix and that of a word, and

complement
The complement
a predicative construction may be of two types :
() a normal accusative form of an adjective, a noun-phrase, a relative clause
(e.g. /saa-'-t tam-ii-nii-""b/ who (-""b) eats (tam-ii-nii-) meat (saa-’-t)*), or a
possessive (¢.g. /beén Yictakeii~’b/ that man (beén Zctak-)'s (-ii’b)

suffixes described in 3.2-3.4 are suffixed, just as though the whole clause was an
adjectival root. There are two ways in’ which adjectival clauses can be used :
predicatively ot attributively (unlike relative clauses in English, for instance,
which can only be used attributively), Compare, for example, /bar-uu-’ buin
beaagta?-dysu/ ‘He (tar-uu-’) doesn’t (or can't) drink (g""a2) coffee (buin)
literally He is not-drinking coffee and /tik butin b-aa-g""a?-iy k-ni-kén/
don't
know (K-ad-kén) a man (tk) who doesn’t/can’t drink coffee’, literally ‘I don’t
know a man not-drinking coffee ’. In either case, the clause has lost’ a nounphrase, in the sense that there is a function in its structure—subject or complement—which cannot be filled, and which should be filled either by the head
*I ’,,‘*”138R. A. HUDSONnoun that the adjectival clause modifies or by the subject of the clause in which

contrast with both
English and Arabic).
Ifthe function of the lost noun-phrase is complement, the genitive ’ morpheme
-e- is added directly to the base of the adjectival clause’s verb—i.e. before its
object pronoun suffixes (e.g. /?i-rabe-"" wi-?ane-"" ?a-s-dabil-ee-uu-'k kee-y-&/ ‘ Where
is (kee-y-8) the luggage (?i-rabe-"") which T (?ane-') caused (-s-) you (-'k) to collect
(dale) 2”; cf. /2uu-tik wi-2i-s-dabil-uu-'k kee-y-a/* Where is the man who caused
collect it ?""). There are also a number of morphological peculiarities in
you
the verbs of adjectival clauses, such as the presence of a suffix -n- in the Preterite
of weak stems
-y-a-n- instead of -y-a-, etc.).
The following classes of verb can be used in adjectival clauses: Present,
Preterite, Past, Bound negative, Past participle and Negative adjectival participle.
Of these only those that show concord with the
subject—i.e. Present, Preterite,
Past and Bound negative—allow the ‘lost’ function to be complement, and
Bound negative does not allow
to be subject, but otherwise there are no restrictions, except on the use of some forms
predicate position ; some can be used
only
if followed immediately by the comparative -ka- ‘more’ (eg. /buin
%4?-4n-kaa-'bsu/ ‘I drank coffee more ').
It is worth noting that the usual way of negating a Preterite or Past verb is to
use the Past participle in a predicative adjectival clause, with the negative of -k-y‘be’ (e.g. /ticrabe-’ dibl-aa~’d keai-kd/ *I didn’t collect the luggage’, literally
“I'm not having-collected the luggage’). This form is thus the negative corresponding not only to a clause where the only difference is that the negative of
-k-y-is replaced by
positive equivalent (a copularclitic)(e.g. /2i-rabe-""dibl-aa~'beu/
‘T have collected the luggage), but also to simple clauses containing Preterite
verbs (e.g. /?i-rabe-’ 2a-dbil/* I collected the luggage ’) or Past verbs (c.g. /Pi-rabe-""
‘iieabil/* I used to collect the luggage ’).isa(inis*to(i.itmorpheme is

negatives correspond in meaning

the

to negate other tenses it is necessary to use auxiliaries (¢.g. /tam-aa-'-b keil-ke/

(©) /tam-i/ he used to eat).to*7.4Non-concordial forms
The following forms of base do not show concord with the subject :
(i) Past participle (e.g. /Aibl-aa~’/, /tam-2a-'/ having collected /eaten *);
Present participle (c.g. /dibl-te/, /tam-te/ eating *);
(ii) Negative adjectival participle (e.g. /o-aa-dabitl/, /b-aa-tam-dy/ not
collecting /eating *) ;
(iv) Negative adverbial participle (e.g. /b-ai-dabisl/, /b-adetam-ty/ without
collecting /eating *) ;
Bound participle (used only before continuative ~t- ‘and’ or before
auxiliaries—see 2.3—e.g. /aibil-ti-’ tam-y-A/‘ having collected it he ate it
/sam-ee-ti ba?-4-nt/ ‘I keep on cating’).
However, although the base itself does not show subject concord, some of
forms (Past participle and Negative adjectival participle) can be used with
ival gender and case-number markers affixed to them, and before copular
which distinguish person as well, so that concord is shown with the subject,
not in the verb base (¢.g. /dibl-aa~bsu/ ‘he has collected ' (lit. he is
’
collected’), /b-aa-tam-ly-tzu/ she can’t eat (lit. she is not eating ’)).
As well as the above forms, which are all true verb bases in the sense that they
objects in the accusative case, etc., there are a large number of derived
‘based on verbal radicals (see Almkvist, 1881 : 275-9, Reinisch, 1893 : 163-75,
Roper, 1928 : 38, 56, 63).

In 7.2-7.4 above we distinguished 15 classes of stem, not counting the ’distinetions according to subject concord and those according to the strength of the
stem. These base classes are distinguished from one another partly by the form
of their stems, and partly by the prefixes and suffixes attached to the stem, as can
be seen clearly from the paradigms in the following section. Considering only the
distinguishing role of the stems, we find only seven relevant classes of stem. These
classes are distributed among the 15 base classes as follows

Although there is no obligatory gender distinction for object pronoun suffixes,
there is a rather odd optional gender distinction according to the addressee's sex
which can be made by adding -a- (masc.) or -i- (fem.) to a Ist person (sing./plur.)
or 2nd person singular object suffix (e.g. /2uu-yaas tam-yi-hetb-a/ (said to a man),
‘/uu-yias tam-yi-hedb-i/ (said to a woman) the dog bit me’). (Almkvist, 1881:
242-3, Reinisch, 1893: 109, Roper, 1928 : 29.)
There are three special cases where the forms listed above are not used but
are replaced by others :
(i After the future suffix -t- (see 7.2, 8.1) they are the same as the possessive
suffixes with the accusative singular marker -oo- before them (e.g. /diroo-'k/* I'll kill you’).
(i) If the clause is used adverbially, with a genitive’ morpheme -e- suffixed
verb (see 10.2), again the object pronoun suffixes are the same as
the possessive suffixes, and are preceded either by the nominative singular
-nu- (meaning, in this environment,
(e.g. /?ane-' rih-a-ny-ce-un-'k/
‘if [see (ane-"" rih-a-ny) you’)
by the accusative singular -00(€.g. /Yane-""rih-a-ny-ee-00-'k-hoob/ when I see you’).

is again that of the possessive suffix, with a case-number marker to suit

"‘**‘*-i--i-*itself‘3.2)GenderThere are two genders, masculine and feminine, which are determined
arbitrarily for inanimate nouns and according to sex for animates. The formal
distinction between the two may be made at one or none of several different places
in the noun-phrase, Feminine noun-phrases always contain at least one instance
of the feminine marker -t- (which is also found in nearly all feminine verbs), and
masculine noun-phrases may or may not contain an instance of the masculine-and-accusative marker -b-. The rules for using these markers are as follows :( feminine -—always prefixed to definite articles and demonstratives containing ~'n-“this”;508—always suffixed to any other modifier ;
—suffixed to the noun-stem before a possessive pronoun suffix (5.1) ;
—otherwise suffixed to noun-stems provided there is no definite article or
preceding modifier.(i) masculine -beae?",[10]
"(@) Noun and adjective stems: the main marker of
plurality is the suffix -a(c.g. /ragéd/* a leg’, /raged-aa-'-b/ ‘legs *), Not
nouns and adjectives take this
plural marker, however; another common one is the shortening of
final
vowel
a consonant-final root (e.g. /ginwit/ ‘a nose’, /gimit/‘ noses’). Roots
ending in a vowel generally make no distinction between singular and plural
other than the accent change described below.allintheor(6) Accents: if a noun
adjective ends, in the plural, in a vowel (irrespective
of whether this vowel is the plural marker -a- or part of the root), it always has a
penultimate accent (1.4) (which is also characteristic of plural verbs—see 8).
Otherwise, accents are cither the same in singular and plural (e.g. /einutt/,
/sinit/ nose(s)’), or contrast in either direction (e.g. /oarriad/, /oarréd/ ‘ tea*pots)’; /bikkéar/, /bikkir/*hut(s) °).

These distinctions are made whenever the vowel concerned is long: in articles
when the rest of the noun or adjective is

Singular and plural are also distinguished in the definite article if the following

"Auxiliary verbs‘An ‘auxiliary verb’ may follow the ‘main verb’, in which case the main
verb may be severely restricted in its grammatical form, and may assume a form
that is not possible in the absence of an auxiliary verb. Consequently such constructions may be assumed to have an embedded sentence (containing the main
verb and any complements it may have) as complement
auxiliary verb.
For instance, in the sentence /?uu-ték saa~'-t tam-l ?i-ndi/ the man (?uu-tak) will

so a morpheme -e- has to be added to clauses before postpositions can be added
to these. There are a number of other distributional similarities between this
morpheme and the ‘ genitive” morpheme, so we shall refer to it as the genitive

"127Survey OF VERB FORMSExtended verbs, verbs, bases, stems, roots and radicals
avoid confusion in the following sections, we shalll distinguish the following
concepts :
Extended verb: a verb plus any suffixes that are added
on behalf of the
whole clause (such as relative and adverbial suffixes described in 9,
10);
Verb: a complete verb word excluding the suffixes just mentioned ;
Base: a verb minus any object
pronoun suffixes, and including all markers of
specifically verbal categories such as mood, tense and subject-concord ;
‘Stem:
a base minus its inflectional markers, leaving only markers of derivational type ;
Root: a single morpheme
a stem minus any separable morphemes which
indicate derivational type ;
Radical: those aspects of the root's phonological structure which are determined lexically rather than by general morphological rules.
For example, take: /ti-takét Zi-rabe-’ ti-s-dabil-heéb-aayt ta? Yi-gawcii-’b 2eo-fe-""/
“Since (-aayt) the woman (ti-takét) caused-to-collect (ti-s-dabil-)

complete syllables.

distinctions for strong and weak stems : there is a lot of similarity, but there are
also important differences.

after /s/ or /s/) and -am- (/m/

noun-phrases and relative clauses, after which the copular clitic
distinguishes gender and number for all persons ; and adverbial words, phrases
and clauses, after which the clitic makes no gender or number distinctions for the
Ist and 3rd persons. We shall call the former type of clitic variable’ and the
latter ‘ invariable *.
Variable clitics are centred on a morpheme which is /a/ (or /w/ before a
vowel) in the singular and /a/ in the plural (for these vowels compare those in the
case-number markers given in 3.2). Before this morpheme may be added the
feminine marker -t- (if the subject is feminine, and the complement doesn’t already
end in the feminine -t-: /ti-k""aa-t-oo-""kst-u/ she is your sister ’, but /k""aa-'teu/

may be added one of the three 2nd person morphemes
-{~a- (masc. sing.)
(fem. sing.), -na- (plural), which are also found in verbs. The
forms are thus as follows : *

/twa-ngial/* the one’ and /gial/* one’);
(il) a postvocalic /a/ or /2/, which prevents the vowel-lengthening otherwise
caused by the addition of the suffixes (as described in 1.3), but which then
appears in the superficial structure before the vowel which it followed in
the underlying structure (e.g. -rih~ ‘see’, in rhit-A/ ‘she saw’, and

Where no vowel is provided by a prefix (¢.g. /?uu-ktiab/ ‘ the book *),
an epenthetic /i/ is added (e.g. /kitiab/*
book’).
If two vowels are adjacent, the first is made long (if

the study of Beja is to identify more
the main outstanding problems
precisely the meanings of these and other inflectional categories of the verb, so
the translations given should be taken only as rough guides to meaning (as should
the names given to the categories).
To
the extent that these forms show concord with the subject, they make
following distinctions, generally with the markers shown :
(i) Ist person singular (prefix -2a- in strong bases) ;
(ii) Ist person plural (prefix or suffix -n-) ;
(iii) 2nd person (prefix or suffix -t-)
(@) masculine singular (suffix -2-)
(6) feminine singular (suffix -i-)
(6) plural (suffix -na-) ;
(iv) 3rd person masculine singular (prefix or suffix -(2)i+ or -y-);
(v) 3rd person feminine singular (prefix or suffix -t-);
(vi) 3rd person plural (prefix or suffix -(2)i- or -y-; suffix -n(a)-).

other sets of distinctions apply to the stem: according to its intensification and
according to its derivational type (7.7). The meaning of a verbal radical can be
‘intensified in one of the following ways :
(i) by repetition of the whole root; irrespective of the type of radical
(yllabie or consonantal), all such stems are weak :

/Miemeuumin-na/ they used to shave together ’). Where the radical is
one that occurs only in stems intensified by lengthening, such as -b-d-n“forget ’, the M-form may be used in passive sentences (Roper, 1928 :
73-4), The passive use of M-forms may be restricted to Bishari and
Halanga (Reinisch, 1893 : 131).
The above are the most important forms for strong stems, but Reinisch, 1893:
