"In native
languages
of
South
America,
the
linguisic
area
in
which
Waraoa
Belongs,
there
are
styles
which
may
be
distinguished
without
any
knowledge
of
the
code
as
structure.
Such
is the
case
in Ghokleng
(Urban;
1985,
198éa,
if8é6b),
a
language
in
which
some
ceremonial
dialogues
characterize
by
formal
features
such
as the
level
of
pitch,
the
metered
syllibification,
the
explosive
phar yngealized
and
laryngealized
articulation,
and
sa
forth.
Thus,
any
listener--even
without
knowing
how
to
speak
Shokleng--will
accept
that
a specific
style
is
in use.
Style
and
structure
in
this
sense
are
opposed
concepts.
Nevertheless,
there
are
other
instances
in which
the
distinctiveness
of
structure
and
style
is a limiting
factor.
One
such
case
is
Xavante
(Graham,
1986),
a
language
in which
the
discoursive
sequences
of
the
ritual
specialist
known
as
the
‘<a’ama
involves
large
stylistic
lexical
substitutions
using
the
basic
morphology
and
syntax
af
Xavante,
This
style
of
the
‘a’ama
is not
marked
by
distinctive
intonation,
metering
or
voice
quality.
As
a result,
listeners
cannot
distinguish
this
style
of
use
from
ordinary
Xavante
language
just
by
listening
to
it.
In
this
sense,
Xavante
behaves
differently
from
Shoklieng
in which
the
different
style
of
the
ceremonial
dialogue
given
its
special
phonological
characteristics
may
be
identified
with
no
knowledge
of
the
structure.
Urban
(1987)
points
out
that
the
‘a'’ama
style
is
a
structure~-dependent
code
variant.
Insofar
as
it
is
structure-dependent,
the
features
that
allow
one
to pick
out
the
style
are
also
features
employed
in building
the
code
as
structure.
Based
upon
the
Xavante
experience,
Urban
(1987)
suggests
a view
of
the relationship
between
Language
and
style
as
in TABLE
23 below1a===PART
STYLE1| STYLE 5PART 2
| STYLE 2 || STYLE fe || STYLE 4| sTYLE é| STYLE 7 |[o...... |==PARTTABLE22:LanguageandstyleulAs
for
morphology
and
syntax,
the
speakers
of
any
language
may
accomplish
a great
many
communicative
tasks
with
the
sentences
of
their
language.
In this
regard,
Sadock
&
Zwicky
(1979)
note
that
speakers~

uses
let
narrate
a tale,
report
what
someone
knows
or
has
heard,
suggest
a joint
action,
give
permissian
to
do samething,
and
so on.
For
some
of
these
uses,
a language
will
have
specific
syntactic
constructions,
or even
specific
forms,
reserved
just
for
these
uses--special
particles,
affixes,
word

elliptical
arrangements,
@etc.--that
will
keep
ai
connection
with
the
roles
of
the
Participants
and
that
ultimately
will

styles.
All
of
the
above

to
