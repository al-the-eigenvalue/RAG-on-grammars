‘alternative’,
and the spelling out of the alternatives;
the particle haxa 'contrast'
can optionally precede
katt in the second of the alternatives,
and seems to give added
emphasis
(see 1.1.1.2.1-2).
In some cases the focus is accomplished by starting with a general question,
using a question
word, with a right dislocation that expresses the alternatives,
again using
(haxa)
katt.
The possibilities of expressing this
focus are seen in:
:not-wellwell,ornot(contr.)alt.well?'of 'topic' as used for a language like English as a case of
contrastive focus.
This is described in 1.11.2.1.3.1, where
it is noted that
'topic'
(in the sense generally used for
English)
is sometimes involved.
This seems to make the best
sense for Hixkaryana,
in which there is a single fronting rule
that covers various functions,
all of which involve emphasis,
focus or highlighting.
This leaves to treat as 'topic'
the kind of phenomenon that
occurs in the so-called
‘topic prominent’
languages,
such as
MandarinandHixkaryana
very largeLisu(LiandThompson,1976,alsoChafe,1976).is in no way a topic prominent language,
since a
proportion of its sentences have the normal gramma-tical
relations:
subject,
direct
object,
adjunct
(adverbial
phrases
and clauses),indirect
object
and
without
any separatecategory that could be defined as topic,
as distinct from,
say,
subject.
There are, however,
some sentences that do seem to
have exactly such a distinct category.
Topic,
in this sense,
has been defined by Chafe as ""the frame within which the
sentence holds""
(Chafe,
1976:51),
and this seems to fit the
cases that are found in Hixkaryana.
They always involve right
dislocation,
constituting a separate intonation group, and are
always nominals,
frequently derived nominals

"Thecollective forms relate to the person of the subject and/or
object, but never to the person categories I or I+III.
The
latter is always expressed by the free pronoun amna
'I+III',
which takes the same form whether the referent is to a single
third person or to a group of third persons
(see the pronoun
paradigm in 2.1.2.1 and also 2.1.2.1.4).
Subject to this constraint,
collective réfers to the person of the subject with
intransitive stems and the copula,
and to the person of either

2.2.1.5.
In some of these derived forms the underlying subject
andobjectfunctionsarenotrelevant,sothatthepossessorand wya relations are not expressed.
These are:
-no 'general nominalization'
(see 2.2.1.2(x)) - when appliedto
verb stems this process results in nouns which refer to some nonspecific person(s) or thing(s) associated
with the actionor state
expressed inthe verb stem: asanimno
‘thing raised up' e.g.
‘riverbank';onono‘eatingofpeople';-saho 'subject

(see 2.2.1.2(vi)):

(see 2.2.1.2(xi)
and 2.2.1.5):‘onethatisnotborn';ekarymahn+'thingthatisnotto- be told', ememnt
'one who does not steal’.
All these
derived nominals result in nouns whose meaning refers directly
to the subject
(if an intransitive stem)
or the object
(if a
transitive),
and in the latter case the underlying subject is
completely out of focus,
so that non-agentive constructionsnounelementsfiniteasenurhunuphrase that has undergone right dislocation.

'Waraka'sis usually sufficient to distinguish subject and object noun
phrases where both occur in the same sentence, since the object
nearly always occurs immediately preceding the verb;
the sub-.

precede the object:

and sometimes

At this point,
ambiguity as to whether it
is subject or object is usually avoided by the different prefixal forms in the verb: n(#)-~ 'IIISIIIO' when there is not a
‘preceding object noun phrase,
and y- ‘IIISIIIO' when there is
a preceding object noun phrase
(see, 2.1.3.6.2.1):

he-grabbed-it
'The man grabbed it (jaguar)'
(195e) nahosiye
'It (jaguar)
grabbed him (man)' or
'de (man) grabbed it (jaguar)!
Ambiguity only arises in (195e), where there isn't any noun
phrase, and this form is used only when the context makes the
meaning clear.
In the other cases the distinctive prefixal
forms avoid any ambiguity.
The verb prefix
does
not always
disambiguate
the
function
of
a preceding
noun phrase.
There
are
zero allomorphs
of both
niand y- which
occur
in the same
environment,
i.e.
precedinga stem-initial consonant
(see 2.1.3.6.2.1);
this
is an absolute conditioning factor when the preceding noun phrase functions as object:
:
(196a) woto
wono
(vb. stem:
-wo- -'shoot')
game-animal he-shot-it
:
‘He shot the animal'
(196b) Waraka hananthyakoni
(vb. stem: -hananthz- 'teach')
Waraka he-used-to-teach-him
'He used to teach Waraka'(196c)Therethokru
korokano
her-child she-washed-him
‘She washed her child'
are,however,two(vb.stem:possibilitieswhen~koroka-the'wash')precedingnounphrase functions as subject:
(i) the allomorph of the prefix
'IIISIIIO'
is zero if the preceding noun phrase
(subject)
is
not phonologically bound to the verb and thus constitutes a
separate
(phonological)
phrase;
i.e. there is left dislocation,
with pause occurring between the noun phrase and the verb
(in
examples cited such pause is signalled by a comma);
and
(ii)
the allomorph of the prefix
'IIISIIIO'
is n- if the noun phrase
(subject)
is phonologically bound to the verb;
thus, the possibilities where the preceding noun phrase functions as subject,
and the verb has a stem-initial consonant,
are:
:
(197a)romuru,wono(or)romurumy-son, he-shot-it
""My son shot it'
(197b)Waraka,
Waraka,hananthyakoné
he used
to teach-him'Waraka
(197c)wost,
woman,usednwonomy-son he-shot-it
‘My son shot it'toteach(or)Warakanhananthyakonz(or)wostnkorokano‘The woman washed him'
A comparison between
(196b)
and (197b)
shows the possibilities
when the same noun phrase precedes the verb, and how its object
function
(196b)
is differentiated from its subject function
(197b),
i.e. by the absence of pause and the n- prefix in the
verb.
Very occasionally there is left dislocation of the
object from the verb,
and this results in genuine ambiguity,
which is only resolved by the context.
Indirect object is expressed by means of a postpositional
phrase, more.specifically a noun phrase followed by the
by'.
The

functions

it functions

"Negative imperative forms follow the pattern of all
negative sentences,
in which the copula is the main verb and
is inflected as such, and in which the negated element is a
pseudo-nominal
form derived from a verb by the addition of the
suffix -htra
'negative'
(see 1.1.2.2.6,
esp.
(58); 1.4.1,
and
2.2.4.2
(iv)).
It is the copula that is marked with the
imperative suffix and with the person-marking prefixes
(II is
zero).
There is no motion category for the copula.
The imperative paradigm for the copula is similar to that given in

"Otherword-classes(1) Particles
.
Particles follow words of any class other than the ideophone,
and never occur as free forms or in isolation.
They are noninflected,
non-derived words and can be divided into three subclasses on the basis of function and position of occurrence in
relation to other particles in a sequence:
(i) modifying particles
(see 2.1.1.1.3), which usually occur first in any such
,
sequence and normally modify a noun
(where they occur in verb
ox adverb phrases they refer to some noun in the context);
(li) discourse particles
(see 2.1.8.1.7-8),
which usually occur
betweenthemodifyingandverificationparticlesin anysequence,and whose normal function is to relate the phrase or sentence
in which they occur to some other part of the discourse;
and
(111) verification particles
(see 2.1.3.4.8-9),
which always
occur last in any particle sequence,
and whose function is to
express the attitude or relationship of the speaker to what he
is saying.
(See also 1.2.3,
1.2.4.3,
1.2.5.2,
and 2.1.8).
(2) Ideophones
Theideophoneisanoninflected,onomatopoeicwordthatdenotes an action that is normally exoressed by a finite verb
form.
It is the only class of word that cannot be followed by
a postpositional particle.
It functions normally as a distinct
sentenceconstituent,carryingthesamemeaningasthatwhenitnormallyprecedesthatverb;(ii)asaseparatesentence,
occurring in isolation;
and
(iii) with an adverbial
element to constitute a separate sentence
(see 1.15.1(4)).
The ideophone may be a single morpheme
(e.g. kr#t#k
'action of
making with the hands')
or a sequence of reduplicated forms
(e.g. sth sth sth sth sth ‘action of walking');
in the latter
case the number of repeats of the form may be from two to ten

derived adverbs

, and postpositional phrases, which may have either simple or derived
nominal heads preceding a postpositional relator
(for those
with derived nominal heads,
i.e. adverb pseudo-clauses,
see
1.1.2.4.2).

The two classes are further marked
by different sets of person prefixes in the fully inflected
verb forms
(see 2.1.3.6.2.1).
Like the subject NP, the direct object NP may also be
deleted, where it is recoverable from the context, but it is
always marked in the person prefix of the transitive class
(the
prefix marks both subject and object - see 2.1.3.6.1).
The
direct object is, therefore,
obligatory in transitive verbs;
there is obligatory absence of direct object in intransitive

"ReciprocalsThe primary way of expressing the reciprocal relation is by
the detransitivizing verb prefixes, which can also have the
reflexive meaning.
A full description,
including examples with
reciprocal glosses,
is given in 1.6.1.3.
As noted in that section,
these prefixes also occur with
postpositional relators,
and can then usually have either the
reflexive or reciprocal meaning,
as shown in (142c).
There
are, however,
a few relators where the addition of the prefix
carries only the reciprocal meaning;
in these cases the
reflexive is marked by t4- 'third person reflexive’:

None of these forms of juxtaposition,
however,
is necessarily
a coordination relationship.
Both sentence sequences within a
discourse and clause sequences within a sentence can signal
other types of relationship.
Juxtaposition of phrases also frequently occurs with other
than a coordinating function,

The same suffixes
(-htni, -~mnt) can also be added to verb
stems to form nominals with the meaning:
'one that does not do
(the action)'
in the case of intransitive stems;
'one on which
(the action)
is not done'
in the case of transitives;
and ‘one
that is not' in the case of the copula
(see 2.2.1.2(xi)):
who does not steal'.
