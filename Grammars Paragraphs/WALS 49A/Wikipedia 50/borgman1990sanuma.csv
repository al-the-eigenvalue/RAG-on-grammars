The preceding has treated of unmarked subject and object, and the
reduction which takes place in first and second person short form pronouns
when used as subject of transitive and ditransitive verbs. There now follows
a discussion of subject and other cases which receive a marker.
15.1.1 Cases marked by -nd. The marker -nd is not phonologically stressed
and is written as a bound form. It marks the subject in transitive and
ditransitive clauses (except when only a short form personal pronoun is
used as subject). It thus functions as a morphological ergative marker, since
nontransitive subjects, like direct objects in transitive clauses, are never
marked. The same form -n6é also marks the superordinate subject in stative,
intransitive,andsemitransitiveclauses.",[106]
"The superordinate participant, which does not need to be expressed
overtly (28), is marked by the agent marker -nd, except in cases where the
short form plural personal pronoun constitutes the superordinate subject
and is marked by deletion of the final -k6 (466, 468). It might be argued
that kai functionsas a transitivizer, so that -ndé in this case wouldfunctioning as an ergative marker in a transitive clause.simply be122BorgmanThe superordinate and subordinate subjects

"Thei maybeomitted,usuallywhentheindefinitemarkerof therestrictive clause is wi. In this case the construction sometimes approachesthe meaning of a compound noun (536, 537) or, when the coreferential
anaphor is the third person general pronoun te without a noun, the
construction may be used to name an object, usually foreign to Sanuma
culture (538-540).
The head of the relative clause consists of a noun plus its classifier
pronoun, or just the classifier pronoun if the noun is already known fromcontext (525, 528, 534).

DPfor the 3rd personpronounditransitive constructions; these are markedsubjectsin transitive andby -nd.)The object in transitive and ditransitive constructions is always unmarked
morphologically, and occurs before the verb and after the subject except
when the subject is a short form first or second person pronoun. In this
case the object is discontinuous, with the classifier or pronoun following the
subject short form pronoun, but with the noun preceding it (60).
There is an instance in which the object assimilates phonologically into
the subject. This takes place when the object is the third person singular 4

In the above example the agent marker -no occurs on the long form

the short form can take the agent marker, as when the numeral is used tomodify the pronoun (603) and when there is an appositional phrase (604).

‘Return to the upper Mucajaf River by motorboat!’1.1.5 Transitive clauses. Both in transitive and ditransitive clauses there is
an obligatory object which is usually expressed overtly, but can be omitted
under certain conditions (sects. 3.1.2 and 3.1.3). Another distinguishing
feature of both these clauses is that the subject is the agent of that which
is expressed in the verb, and is marked by -nd (except in the case of short
form personal pronoun subjects—seesect. 15.1.1.1).",[14]
"Themarkersnihaand haindicate what in a broad sense can be labeled ‘goal’. The meanings differ
in accordance with the type of clause in which they are found. These
markers are discussed and exemplified in the section on emotion clauses
(sect. 1.1.1.5, examples 36-40), activity clauses (sect. 1.1.4.1, examples
49-53),motionclauses(sect.1.1.4.2, examples55, 57, 59), andditransitiveclauses where the niha/ha can indicate source as well as goal, depending on
the verb used (sect. 1.1.6, examples 77, 80, 81).
15.2 Possession. Possession is expressed either by one of two possessive
pronouns, or by a noun phrase or long form pronoun preceding the
possessed item. With inalienably possessed body parts, the short form
pronoun is used.
15.2.1 The personal possessive pronouns. There are only two possessive
pronouns, the first person singular ipa ‘my’ and the second person singular
au ‘your’. These immediately precede the possessed item.

3:SG15.2.2 Noun phrase or pronoun preceding possessed item. Possession is also
expressed by a noun phrase or a long form pronoun preceding the
possessed item. When possession is expressed in this way, usually the
specifier hai and the relative i follow the noun phrase or pronoun and
precede the possessed item. In this possessive construction, the singular
form of the classifier follows the possessed noun, unless more (or at least
equal) prominence is given to the possessor (492, 493).
Though less common, the noun may precede the possessed item without
the specifier and relative (491). It may be that in these cases identification
rather than possession is signified.
Although there is a possessive pronoun for the first and second person
singular and this is used most commonly, possession may also be expressed
by the regular long form first and second person pronouns. This probably
indicates that the possessor receives special emphasis.

1,330 entries in which these verbs occurred. There were only 20occurrences of two other verbs used in quote tag clauses: the first is the
compoundverbnoatha‘to order,urge,direct,retort’(whichcomesfromthe noun ‘payment, return’ and the verb ‘do, make’); the second is the verb
tha-ma ‘to be prompted or forced to say’ (lit., ‘to be caused to do’). These
verbs are transitive, with subject and object occurring in the quote tag110Borgmanclause, as in (438-440). (For Sanuma readers the following scheme for
quotation marks is used: the citation is marked at the beginning and end bythe dash [—], the embedded citation is marked by quotation marks [“ ”],
and the citation embedded in an already embedded citation is marked by
the single quotation mark [‘’]. In the English translation, single quotes are
used for the whole free translation as usual, double quotes [‘”] are used
for the citation, single quotes [‘’] for a citation within a citation, and
double quotes again for a citation within a citation which is embedded in

"Experienceclausesdescribeanemotionalorperceptional experience on the part of the participant. In these clauses the
object is unaffected in that there is no physical contact or change that

Some description verbs can become derived operation transitive verbs
either through the use of the causative marker -ma or through the
derivational process under consideration. In the latter case usually -pa or
-ta ‘extent of action’ is added to the verb phrase. The choice of whether to
use the causative -ma or the extent of action -pa/-ta depends upon whetherthe prominence is on the resultant state (with -ma) or on the action itself,
as in ‘Make it tight’ versus ‘Tighten it’. (See exs. 156-158.)
18.6 Direction, location, and clarification. There are direction and location
indicators within the verb phrase; they follow extent of action and change
focus markers and precede the tense-degree of knowlege-location and
degree of fulfillment markers. In a given verb phrase there can be
direction,location,or a combinationof bothwhenthedirectionalis -ima‘approaching’ (186, 831, 832).","[186, 187, 188]"

subjects in nontransitive clauses. As mentioned in sect. 1.1 there is a
comitative construction in which there is a leader-follower relationship. The
subordinate participant is marked by kai, which in rare instances has beenfound to occur without the noun or pronoun it is marking (469). Though
much less common, inanimate objects can be marked by kai (468).",[107]
"4.1 Reflexives. There are two types of reflexive: the direct and causative.
4.1.1 The direct reflexive. In the direct reflexive, the subject acts upon itself.
Even though semantically the referent is agent as well as recipient of the
action, only one argument is specified —the subject, and this does not take
the agentmarker-nd. Thesubject couldbe plural,but the singular is farmore common.
The receptive verb marked by -so ‘change focus’ and the adverb kd/ko
‘return, again’ are used in the direct reflexive, but these features in
themselves do not mark reflexivity. Along with these features there must be
either the adverb sapa ‘turn around and go back’, or the long form of the
personal pronoun,or both. If the subject is a noun, or if the short form ofthe pronoun is used, the adverb sapa normally occurs.

‘Like the old people were, like that you should be, too.’18 Verb phrase structure
The class of verb occurring as head of the verb phrase correlates with the
clause type in which it occurs, except in the one case in which the
existence verb occurs as head of an identification clause. Thus, in
description clauses there are description verbs, in motion clauses, motion
verbs, etc. Each class of verb, therefore, is basic to one clause type. It ispossible, however, for a verb to occur in a clause type other than its basic
one. The verb phrase in such a case is a derived verb phrase. For
example, a transitive verb occurring in a stative clause is a derived stative
verb. (See sect. 18.5 which deals with derivation.)
The verb phrase may be analyzed in terms of nuclear and peripheral
constituents. The peripheral constituents are adverbs and function to modify
the head. A maximum of four have been found in any one verb phrase. In
general, there are fewer in stative type verb phrases than in others. The
broadmeaningoftheclassesofadverbsare:time,location,manner,co-occurrence in relation to other participants, sequence in relation to other
actions, and limitation of action. This is also the usual order in which the
adverbs occur within the verb phrase. The adverbs are discussed in sect.
18.7.
The nuclear constituents are the head and combinations of constituents
indicating durative, punctiliar, iterative, and repetitive aspects, extent of
action,categorycontinuation,withthechangethreefocus,componentsnegation,of tense,direction,degreeasingleof knowledgelocation,andlocation, and degree of fulfillment.","[149, 150]"

In age-oriented existence clauses there is an obligatory referent

‘dual’, and /opo ‘plural’ occur with nouns which are used in a more general
sense, and include uncommon
objects, nominalizations,
mass nouns, acollective group of spirits or people, or one belonging to such a group such
as a female, a non-Indian, or a Brazilian.",[131]
"1.1.1.1 Identification clauses. Identification clauses are characterized by an
obligatory subject, which is the identifying element, an obligatory
complement, which is the item or person to be identified, but which is
often not overtly expressed if the complement is clear from context, and a
copular verb, which occurs only when non-present tense is used. The
complement distinguishes this clause type from the other stative clauses.
Following are examples given in the order of most common usage: with
subject only (6-9), with complement and subject (10-12), with subject andSanuma21copula (13, 14), and with complement, subject, and copula (15, 16). The
personal pronouns in the following examples function as classifiers that
form part of the noun phrase (sects. 15.3.1.1 and 16).

spacedtext,it occurred1,927times,624timesmorethanthecommonclassifier te.
16.5.1 Grammatical relationships of the relative pronoun i. As discussed in
sect. 15.3.2.1, the relative i often refers back to an immediately preceding
relative clause. This relative pronoun also can refer to an element beyond

16.1.4 Body part classifier. The body part classifier pili optionally occurs
with human and animal body parts. This classifier is different from the
others in that it precedes the noun and in that it has no dual or plural
forms, and usually the noun to which it refers does not take the dual orplural either.

"Therearefourtypesofclassifiers: specific, general, characteristic, and body part. The first three
types have a singular, dual, and plural form. Dual and plural are relativeterms. Dual can mean ‘few’ as well as ‘two’, and plural at times signifies
‘two’ as well as ‘more than two’ or ‘many’.
With some nouns the dual is rarely used, only the plural: sai pd ‘two or
more houses’ and sanédma tép6 ‘two or more Sanumas or people’. With
other nouns the plural is rarely used, only the dual: ilo kdk6é ‘red howler

Specific, general, and characteristic classifier pronouns are translated as
‘he,she,it, they’.",[130]

An adverbial phrase, such as locative, may occur in the quote tag clause,

14.5.2 The citation clause. Because (1) the usual verb of the quote tag is
intransitive, (2) the manner phrase i naha ‘like that’ introduces, or
potentially introduces, the quote tag, and (3) there is already an object
expressed in the quote tag when the verb is the transitive noa tha ‘to
order, urge’ or tha-ma ‘to prompt to say’, the citation clause is not
considered to have the function of direct object, but rather is considered tobe a complement to the quote tag clause. It should be noted that even
though it is labeled as ‘complement’, the citation clause may appear without
the quote tag clause, if the context makes it clear that the clause is indeed
a citation, and if the identity of the person making the quote is also clear.
This is the case in dialogue, for example, where there is a rapid exchange
of speakers with fairly short quotations.
