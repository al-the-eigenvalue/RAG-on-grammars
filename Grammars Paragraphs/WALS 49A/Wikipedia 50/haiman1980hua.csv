"If conditional clauses are the class of clauses whose verb
ends with the characteristic desinence Relative
+ mo/na,
then it is
not true of such clauses that they are necessarily hypothetical:
witness given conditions. Nor is it the case that they are causal:
witness the contrast between conditionals and coordinate medials.
Since these two characteristics are precisely what usually define
ordinary language conditionals, both in linguistics and philosophy,
(cf. Jespersen 1940, for the hypothetical character of conditionals,
and Strawson 1952 for the idea of causal relationship), the ques­
tion arises whether these clauses are characterized by any semantic
homogeneity whatsoever. The answer of course is yes.
The properties shared by all conditional clauses are shared as well
by the relative clauses and nominalized clauses in -ma '3 to which they
are morphologically similar. (Recall that -mamo3 is equivalent to
-ma '3 + the potential topic suffix -mo, while -hipana3
is equivalent to
-hipa3 - the relativized form of the irrealis -hine3 - + the nominal
suffix na) .
These properties, broadly speaking, are the following: unlike co­
ordinate medial clauses, which depend on the following clause in a num­
ber of ways, conditional clauses are independent of following clauses in
tense, mood, and sequence, and impervious to denial from such following
clauses. Their role in sentences is that of most subordinate clauses,
or, for that matter, of referential noun phrases: they mark entities, in
this case, propositions, whose validity is presupposed rather than
asserted.in the framework of discourse.
They differ from the other subordinate clauses enumerated in
section 13, and from relative clauses, in that they occur in the
nominative case. The nominative case, alone in Hua, has a twofold
function, relating to the systems of transitivity and theme, in the
system of transitivity, it marks the role played by
participants
in an event (e.g., subject of intransitive verb or object of tran­
sitive verb). In the system of thematic relations it marks the
background
for an event, and its function here corresponds rather
to that of the ablative absolute in Latin.
Conditionals, as clauses in the nominative case, mark back­
ground and serve as the topics of the sentences in which they oc­
cur: not ""what the speaker is talking about"" but rather, ""the old
information"" in the sentence. That this background is relevant to
the events described in the sentence is beyond question (otherwise,
presumably, it would not be included), but its exact relationship
with these events is left unspecified.
The essential independence of conditional clauses is illus­
trated in the following brief survey of their most characteristic
uses.",[471]

Nouns in the genitive, locative, and comitative cases have
already been discussed: they are clearly nominal forms acting as
qualifiers. The same is true of nouns in the nominativeabsolutive case, modifying the heads of compound nouns, and, in
the formula above, part of the noun complex itself. It is worth
emphasising here that these four categories of nouns may cooccur,
and do so in the order given above:

'The man's piq house down below'
It will become apparent shortly that most of the other prenominal
determiners to be discussed in this section are also underlying
nouns, capable of, but not limited to, acting as adjectives.
9.1DeicticsDeictics, like articles and demonstratives in English, cooccur
with common nouns only. While they are not obligatory, they are
rarely absent from subject
nouns.
9.1.1The indefinite deicticbgo'The only indefinite deictic bgo ' means either ""some"", ""a"", or
""(some) more"":
bgo'
bgo'de
Mni'(+mo) Koe
(+mo)'I saw some man (or another).'
'some (more) water'The word also occurs alone as a pronoun, as in bgo'
'a'ttne+e
'there isn't any more'. It may also be followed by one of the
postnominal qualifiers of section 8.2.3, namely rva'
'plain', to
form the numeral "" 1 "" , /bgotva'/.",[316]
"AppositionAgreeing ergativeAgreeing genitive-ta
-Kita-muta
-mita-mata
-ita(Ki)(mi)(genitive plural)The crucial syntactic difference between appositions and the
agreeing genitive is that the former do not occur on common nouns
at all.
8.2.5.7The utterance case: the vocativeThe vocative has been traditionally named a case on paradig­
matic grounds, although it differs syntactically from all other
cases: while true cases define the role a noun plays as part of a
sentence, the vocative form of a noun is in itself a complete
sentence. In Hua, the vocative case is not only syntactically,
but also morphologically distinct from other cases: although mu­
tually exclusive with them, it occurs in a different ""slot"", and
cannot be fully described until the appearance and distribution
of two further post-nominal suffixes, the citation suffix -a and
the potential topic marker -mo has been completed.
The restrictive quantifier Ko'8.2.6This suffix, meaning ""only"", may follow all case suffixes
listed here, with the exception of the genitive:

Benefactive: Busa'+hi'+Ko'(/busasiko'/) 'only for Busa'

"Nouns in the genitive case can act only as qualifiers. Nouns
in other cases (the nominative, locative/allative, inessive/illative, and comitative) may act as qualifiers in some cases. When
they act as nouns, they may occur with the suffix -mo-, when they
act as qualifiers, they may not.
The nominative (or absolutive) case is used for the first
members of N+N nominal compounds, where the first member qualifies
or limits the second: zu' 'house', fu±zu'
'pig house'. While theNOUN COMPLEXES247first member of such a compound may sometimes occur with the ci­
tation suffix -a (a notable example being ()Kia'+
a Koa /kianagoa/
'foot penis' or 'toenail'), it may never occur with the suffix
-mo: fu (*mo)±zu'
'pig house'; ube 'ancestor', Ke 'story', ube (*mo)
±Ke 'myth'; Kenaga 'long time ago', vede 'men', Kenaga
(*mo)±vede
'men of long ago'.
The long form of the adessive/allative case is used as a
qualifier: thus, for example, the phrase d#mu'+roga
'on my sore',
may function either as an adverb phrase, as in /osi' dmutoga baie/
'the flies are on my sores' or as a kind of relative clause
/dmutoga osi'/ 'the flies (which are) on my sores'. In the first
case, the suffix -mo is possible, while in the second, it is not.
The sentence

[d # mu'+roga

[d # mu'+roga] [osi1]baive
baive'Are you the flies on my sores?'
'Are (there) flies on my sores?'","[305, 306]"
"115The parts of speech: some morphological definitionsThere are three possible syntactic functions for a Hua word:
topic, modifier of topic, or utterance (=predicate). These func­
tions correspond roughly to the three categories Noun, Adjective,
and Verb, which exist in Hua as in other languages. Nevertheless,
the correspondence is not exact: nouns may function not only as
(potential) topics, but also as modifiers and as utterances; verbs
may function not only as utterances, but as modifiers and as top­
ics. Adjectives alone are defined as that class of words which
are possible only as modifiers. (This definition leads to a very
small class of true adjectives, whose membership is similar to
that of adjective classes in other languages with a small, closed
set of adjectives, cf. Dixon 1977.)
The overlap between nouns and verbs is not entirely a conse­
quence of derivational morphology. It is true that there are a large
number of nominalizing suffixes which may appear on verbs (and a
somewhat smaller number of verbalizing suffixes on nouns), but
there are cases when we find bare nominal roots acting as predi­
cates and bare verbal roots acting as topics. Consequently, the
most reliable criteria for identifying words as nouns, verbs, or
adjectives are generally phonological, morphological, or semantic:
that is to say, anything but syntactic. The following definitions
are phonological and morphological. (Semantically, a noun is the
name of a person, place or thing, while a verb or adjective is the
the name of a state or activity, etc.)
A verb complex consists of a verb, which may occur with a
number of affixes. Verbs are phonologically distinct from other
words in being subject to the ablaut rules (52), (53), and (58),
and to the syllable structure constraint SSC. 2. They are mor­
phologically distinct from other words in that they occur with a
variety of affixes which specify tense, aspect, and mood. A verb
complex as a whole is distinct from a noun complex in being able
to occur with the prefixes 'a' (a) 'negative' and u' 'already'.
A noun complex consists of a noun which may occur with a num­
ber of affixes and adjuncts. No special phonological constraints
characterize nouns. Only a noun complex or a derived nominal may
be inflected for case.
Adjectives
by definition are words which may occur only as
modifers on nouns. Most adjectives are prenominal, and are di­
vided into three groups, deictics,
quantifiers
, and
qualifiers.
A small number of qualifiers occur post-nominally.
Interjections
are uninflected words which function only as
complete utterances.",[174]
"(We would expect a form *zahi + ma + na in the second case, given
that the tense of the medial verb is non-future, while that of the
final verbis future.)276MORPHOLOGYAnother interrogative verb is aiga'thu,
a compound of the in­
terrogative ""which"", meaning ""do what"", or ""do how"". As a final
verb aiga'thu
means ""be how?"", as in /aigafane/ 'how are you?'.
As a same-subject medial verb, it means simply ""how"", as in
/aigafuka ai'ane/ 'How did you come up?', /aigafuna havie/ 'How
did he come up?' and so on. As a change of subject medial, it
means ""how is it that..."" as in /aigafigaka hane/ 'How is it that
you did it? How does it come about that you did it? ' , /aigaf igana
hie/ 'How is it that he did it?'.
11.2Interrogative nounsThe interrogative kzo'
'who' corresponds to nouns with human
referents. It occurs, like any other noun, with the full range
of case affixes, although there are two idiosyncrasies to be noted:
the genitive case suffix is zero, and an alternative enlarged
form of the pronoun, kzo'ama' T occurs optionally before the geni­
tive and the comitative case affixes:
Nominative: kzo' +0
Ergative : kzo' + mamu '
Genitive : Kzo' +0
Comitative: kzo! + Ki'
Locative : kzo ' + ro'
Inessive : kzo ' + vi '
Ablative : kzo ' + roti'
Elative
: kzo' + viti'(+mo)
'who'

(+mo)
' to whom '
(+mo)
' in whom '
(+mo)
' from whom '
(+mo)
'out of whom'There is no vocative. However, unlike all other pronouns
and common nouns, kzo' may be followed by the second person sin­
gular pronoun apposition (before which, like all words, it loses
its final glottal stop), and this form /kzoga/ functions some­
thing like a vocative.

"Morphology reflects syntax inasmuch as only those cases which
confer a nominal function cooccur with two further nominal suf­
fixes: the potential topic marker mo, and the actual topic markerve.
All case affixes follow all other suffixes discussed up to228MORPHOLOGYthis point. With the exception of the benefactive and the comitative (which may cooccur with other case affixes) they are mu­
tually exclusive.
8.2.5.1NominativeThe nominative or absolutive case is the case in which nouns
occur that are subjects of intransitive verbs, direct or indirect
objects of (di)transitive verbs, and qualifiers in nominal com­
pounds. It is invariably the unmarked case, its characteristic
mark, the suffix ø. There is however a special suffix -a, called
the citation suffix, which occurs regularly and exclusively on
nominal stems in the nominative case alone: although it is in com­
plementary distribution with the potential topic suffix -mo, and
discussed together with this suffix, its limited distribution may
lead in time to its reinterpretation as the characteristic sign of
the nominative case.
8.2.5.2The ergativeThe ergative is the case affix with which nouns occur which
are the subjects of (di)transitive verbs. It has distinct forms
in the singular and the plural.
Following a vowel, the suffix is invariably /mu'/: de+mu'
'the man boy', kra +'di+mu'
'my dog'.
'the man(erg.)', bade+mu'
Following a glottal stop, instead of the expected */bu'/,
the ergative suffix is phonetic ['ßamu']: [a'ßamu1] 'the woman
(erg.)', nono '+ ' dima[ ' ßamu ' ] 'my maternal uncle'. The phonetic
sequence ['ßamu'] can have three possible underlying sources:
'mamu',
'bamu' and 'vamu'.
A sporadically occurring -mamu'
ergative suffix on vowel final roots (e.g. de+mamu' 'the man'
(erg.)) can be explained as a back formation if the underlying
form of the ergative suffix following glottal stop-final stems is
taken as mamu' rather than *bamu' or *vamu'.
The dual and plural ergative ending -mi(post-glottal['ßi]):
epva' + Ki + mi /epvagimi/ 'their fathers (erg.)'; naga' + mi
/naga bi/ 'people (erg.)' is restricted to animate nouns. Nouns
forming a true plural (proper names, kin terms, and the handful
of common nouns listed in section 8.2.1.1, above) must always be
marked for plurality if they occur with the ergative plural suf­
fix: vede+mi
(*de+mi)
'men (erg.)' epva' + Ki + mi
(*epva'+mi)
' their fathers (erg.)'. Nouns which form collectives by the suf­
fixation of vza or vutavu
may either use this suffix or not be­
fore the ergative plural: mna (+vza) + mi '(flock of) birds229NOUN COMPLEXES(erg.)'. (This is further evidence for the contention that these
suffixes are not true pluralizing morphemes.)
8.2.5.2.1The agreeing ergativeA feature of the ergative suffix which distinguishes it from
other case affixes is that it is obligatorily marked not only for
number, but for person as well. This is most clearly shown in the
complete pronominal paradigm, where each of the personal pronouns
occurs with a distinctive ergative suffix, an allomorph of a spe­
cial ergative suffix - ( v i b a ) m u ' :

""in the bush'The embarrassment remains: in sentences (10b) - (13b), (14b),
and (15) - (17), a nominal expression is acting as a complete sen­
tence. No such nominal should allow the potential topic suffix
-mo.
All the nominal expressions in these sentences do.
To remove this embarrassment, it is necessary to recognize
two kinds of ellipsis in Hua. The first, which is particular to
Hua, was formally defined in section 7.3.2.1.2.3 and occurs where
a complete well-formed sentence signals the mood of the following
sentence. The second, which is universal, and which I call 5ellipsis
is a practical device whereby grammatical constraints on
well-formed sentences are
broken.
In all languages, sentence fragments are used occasionally as
complete utterances. A longstanding controversy exists as to
whether these fragments are derived from well-formed complete
sentences by rules of deletion (the transformationalist view) or
generated tels quels by phrase structure rules (the interpretivist
view) .
Neither view is totally persuasive: there are tremendous
mechanical difficulties associated with the transformational view,
of which the greatest seems to be that the deleted context is
simply not uniquely recoverable in most cases (at least, not from
purely grammatical information); on the other hand, there is a
perfectly justified and widespread feeling that to generateTRANSITIVITY349sentence fragments by exactly the same grammatical machinery as is
used in the production of well-formed sentences, is to overlook a
crucial distinction between the two.
I propose that sentence fragments, or S-ellipses, like after­
thoughts, occur as self-conscious violations of agreed rules of
grammatical structure. Their status in Hua is reflected in the
relative distributions of the potential topic suffix -mo and the
various predicate markers -e, and -vei ideally, the two should be
in complementary distribution. In fact, they may cooccur because
the former occurs on all constituents which are meant (by the
grammar) to be parts of sentences but which may be used (by the
speaker) as complete utterances. The latter occur only on con­
stituents which are actually used as complete utterances.
15.2ReflexivesIt is crucial to distinguish between verbs like ""shave"" whose
object is typically identical with the subject, and verbs like
""kick"" whose object is generally distinct from the subject.
Reflexive pronouns are used only with the latter set of verbs.
15.2.1Extroverted verbsReflexives such as ""I kicked myself"" are even more recherche
in Hua than they are in English, but they can be uttered. The re­
flexive pronoun is the same as the emphatic pronoun, and consists
of the free-standing pronoun followed by the possessive suffix in
the same person (cf. section 8.2.4.1).

8.2.4MORPHOLOGY
Pronominal appositionIn English, the phrase ""you guys"" is colloquial. The phrase
""I, Claudius"", on the other hand, is bookish. The only difference
between the two kinds of phrases is that in the first the pronoun
is an apposition (or an article, cf. Postal 1965) to a common noun,
while in the second, it is an apposition to a proper name. In
Hua, the situation is almost the opposite: pronominal appositions
are obligatory on all kin terms and proper names, and impossible
on common nouns (except as special forms of the genitive and
ergative cases: these will be discussed in the context of the case
affixes).
The pronominal appositions are similar to, but distinct from,
other pronoun forms:

Ka[3.","[284, 285]"
"252MORPHOLOGYIt is impossible, using either -Ve or -Ki, to conjoin nouns
in the ergative, genitive, or vocative cases (irrespective of the
phonetic shape of these case markers on the nouns conjoined):
Ergative: *de + mu'■/■ mo -f | ,| a' + mamu'+ mo + *\ . r'the man (erg.) and the woman (erg.)'
Genitive: *de + ma'+ (mo) V^>a ' + ma ' + (mo) \ ^ \(fu)'the man's and the woman's (pig)'
Vocative : *ma de + a + \ „ ,\ ma a' + a + \ „ . \
[Kl)
{Kl}
'You man and you woman!'
A partial explanation for this failure is the following: the po­
tential topic suffix -mo may not cooccur with either genitives or
vocatives; the citation suffix -a, which can occur only in voca­
tives, must cooccur with the predicate marker -e, which, however,
is mutually exclusive with both -ve and -Ki.
However, both the
conjunctions -ve and -Ki require that the immediately preceding
morpheme be one of either -mo and -a. The conflict between these
various constraints makes the conjunction of genitives and voca­
tives impossible.
The failure of the ergative suffix to occur with either of
the conjunctions -ve or -Ki correlates with the constraint that
the ergative suffix is possible only on nouns that are understood
as the only subjects of transitive verbs: nouns which are parts
of such subjects are hence excluded.
Some evidence for the generality of this constraint is forth­
coming when we begin to consider ways in which -ve and -Ki
differ,
in the vocative, genitive, and ergative.
While nouns in these cases may not be conjoined, the con­
junction of two nouns may itself be treated as a noun phrase on
which the ergative, genitive, and vocative suffixes are added.
But the only possible conjunction is -Ki,

and personal pronouns, is apparently zero.) To be understood as
vocatives, two noun phrases that are conjoined must each be fol­
lowed by the personal pronoun apposition of the second person
singular, -Ka.
The conjunction of these nouns may not itself be
followed by any of the regular vocative suffixes (-a+e, or -o),
but may be followed by the second person dual personal pronoun
apposition -Kita'a
'you two'. This form, it seems, is semantically equivalent to a vocative suffix, and is only possible, like
the other case suffixes above, when the two nouns are conjoined
by -ICi:

and+Clearly, strings of the form A+Ki B+Ki are treated as single
noun phrases, while strings of the form A+ve B+ve are not. They
may be diagrammatically distinguished as (1) and (2) below:But such a distinction is possibly what should be expected, given
that lists of items conjoined by -Ki are exhaustive, and lists of
items conjoined by -ve are not. The former constitute a welldefined group,
and the latter do not.
It has already been proposed that the ergative suffix can oc­
cur on noun phrases only when these are understood as the only
subjects of their predicates. This constraint correlates with the
failure of the ergative suffix to occur on the partial lists A+ve
B+ve.
Furthermore, there is evidence, again from English, that
the vocative at least is similarly constrained: it is possible on­
ly when the addressee(s) are exhaustively enumerated. Compare,

"Since the prefixes d- and p- in the above sentences obviously

16.1Ønogu'KaidgaiKoThe expression of possessionThere are three ways of indicating the possessor of a possess­
ed noun: the genitive case of the possessor noun (e.g. dgai'
fu
'my pig'), the possessive prefix (e.g. dnogu''rny maternal nephew'),
and the possessive suffix (e.g. fudi
'my pig'). The purpose of
this section is to discuss the relationship between these three
ways of marking possession.
Of these three means of marking possession, the possessive
prefix is limited to inalienably possessed nouns (note the impos­
sibility of saying, for example *dfu 'my pig'), and subject to
phonological constraints, is obligatory for these nouns. (Note
nogu' or *nogudima'
for 'my
that it is impossible to say *dgai'
maternal nephew', so long as prefixation is available).
The other two devices are available for both alienable and
inalienably possessed nouns.
Only the genitive case of the full possessor noun is in the
deep structure representation of the possessor: both prefixes and
suffixes of possession are the result of agreement transforma­
tions, which may be distinguished as prefix agreement and suffix
agreement.
On inalienably possessed nouns, prefix agreement must apply
wherever possible. Where prefix agreement is blocked for any
reason, suffix agreement must apply. However, where prefix agree­
ment yields a zero output (i.e. in the 3sg., where the prefix is
0 ) , suffix agreement need not apply. It is possible for both pre­
fix and suffix agreement to mark an inalienably possessed noun:
Prefix agreement only: d+nogu'

'our feet'Infixation whether in irregular nouns like e'gu'
'elder brother'
or in regular /ha../ initial nouns like hamu' 'namesake' is syn­
tactically equivalent to prefixation, as the necessary mark of
possession for inalienably possessed nouns: thus, the impossibil­
ity of *dgai'e'gu'
'my elder brother' or *hamu+kama' 'your name­
sake ' .
Inalienably possessed nouns which are marked by neither prefixation or suffixation for the person of the possessor are ungrammatical: thus, *dgai'ete
'my husband', *Kgai vza 'your mouth'.
On alienably possessed nouns, prefix agreement is impossible,
and suffix agreement optional. Possession must be marked in some
way, but this may be by either the genitive noun phrase, the pos­
sessive suffix, or both: dgai'
fu, fudi,
or dgai'
fudi
'my pig'.
Cooccurrence of both prefix and suffix of possession on those
inalienably possessed nouns which allow it seems to be no differrent from the appearance of just the prefix. However, cooccurrence
of either prefix or suffix with the free-standing genitive pro­
noun, or the occurrence of just the free-standing pronoun with
alienably possessed nouns marks emphatic or contrastive stress of
the possessor:
Possessor not stressed: d+nogu'~ d+nogu+dima'ete+di

"It seems plausible, then, that the suffix -hi',
like the
English word ""for"", is a polysemous morpheme with two apparently
separate, but in fact closely connected meanings. The fact that
it may follow medial verbs then provides further evidence that
these verbs are morphological nominalizations.
It may be that the nominalizing element in such medial con­
structions is the anticipatory desinence, which, as noted many
times above, is morphologically similar not to the verbal de­
sinences, but to the personal pronouns. Verbal desinences have
three forms, A, B, C, where A = lsg., 3sg., 2/3pl., B = dual,
C = 2sg., lpl.; pronouns have seven forms, corresponding to each
of the different persons, three singulars, two duals, and two
plurals.
If so, it is possible that medial verbs, and medial clauses,
could be analyzed as complements on a noun phrase head, as below:The anticipatory desinence, morphologically the final desinence
on a verb, is, according to this analysis, the head of a comple­
ment construction.
Once medial verbs have been identified with nominal forms,
all déverbal constructions occurring in syntactic configuration
III are analyzable as nouns: the distribution of the suffix -mo
is then justified by morphological, as well as syntactic, criteria.
We turn now to constituents occurring in syntactic configura­
tion II. It has already been shown that no noun phrase occurring
in such a configuration may occur with the suffix -mo, and it re-286MORPHOLOGYmains only to show that no true adjective may occur with this suf­
fix either. For the sake of completeness, we shall consider not
'big', but also quasionly the true adjectives like ferafera
adjectives like soko 'good', deictics like ma 'this' and numerals
like rori
'two', all of which, as we have seen, are actually ca­
pable of acting as independent nouns, and thus identified as un­
derlying nouns.
Not one of these may occur with -mo, clearly indicating that
the syntactic function of the word alone, rather than its morpho­
logical category membership, is responsible for the distribution
of the particle here (but recall that the category of morpholo­
gical adjective was defined in purely syntactic terms in the first
place: adjectives are those words which occur only in configura­
tion II.)

tic configuration I. Not only do noun phrases acting as complete
utterances fail to occur with -mo. No final clause, however
marked, should
occur with this suffix either. Thus, the suffix
-mo should not cooccur with any of the final verbs listed in section
7.2.2.1. This prediction is true in every case but one:

dressing a single man, woman, group of men, group of women, etc.
The variable prefix pronoun K- 'your (sg.)' and p- 'your (pl.)'
refers to the addressee(s), the possessor(s) of goa 'penis' or
gau 'vagina'. The invariable possessive suffix di clearly does
not.
It functions here, as on ega'adi
and Burodima',
as a mark of
affection and enthusiasm.
It would be possible to argue that the lsg. possessive suffix
on expressions such as these is in fact not a possessive suffix at
all, but an accidental homophone, were it not for the fairly clear
connection which exists even in languages like English between
expressions of possession and (proprietary) pride and affection.
In any case, it does not owe its origin to a copying transforma­
tion like T2.
Still another source must be posited for the use of the 2sg,
possessive suffix -ka, meaning ""a certain.."": keBiri
vi+ka
fumo
kaie:
'a certain stunted man took care of the pigs'. This man
does not belong to the addressee any more than his English
congener does in expressions like ""your average heroin addict"".
Finally, it is implausible that possessive suffixes added
to personal pronouns to form emphatic or reflexive pronouns are
added to these pronouns by a copying transformation. It is possi­
ble, but semantically pointless, to derive rgai-hti
'we ourselves;
just us' from underlying *rgai'
rgai
'our we' or kai'a
'she her­
self; just her' from an underlying expression *kai'
kai 'her she'.
This is particularly clear in the case of medial verbs whose
pronominal anticipatory desinence may be followed by a prefer­
ential possessive suffix with the same meaning ""just; only"":

Note that the auxiliary verb bai is subject to the predesinential
ablaut rules, since it immediately precedes the indicative de­
sinences e f 'e, and ne. But the main verbs hu, do, and mi, pro­
tected from the desinence by the intervening morpheme bai are
subject to a rule which fronts the final vowel of the verb stem
in the second person form of the non-singular numbers:
58The general ablaut rule
V> [+front]+When this rule is ordered after the other ablaut rules, no further
environment for its application need be specified.
Since the rule is so general, it is worth considering some
of the rather surprising cases where it does apply.
3.1.3.1 The general ablaut rule with subjectless verbs
In Hua, as in most other languages (Perlmutter's ""type B
languages"", Perlmutter 1971), unstressed pronouns are deleted by
a low-level rule. The fact that verbs agree with these pronouns
is not particularly unusual. As is the case with languages like56PHONOLOGYItalian and Turkish, the rule of agreement is simply ordered to
apply before pronoun deletion.
But there are other rules which delete subjects at a much
deeper level, rules like equi-noun phrase deletion and imperative
subject deletion which apply not only in type B languages, but in
type A languages like English as well. Of the resulting verb forms,
imperatives generally agree with their subjects, but infinitives
never, or seldom do.
The situation is different in Hua: before the imperative and
infinitive suffixes, verbs are subject to the general ablaut rule,
and thus agree with subjects which may have been deleted by imper­
ative formation and equi-noun phrase deletion.
Below are the imperatives of hu 'do', do 'eat1 and ml f give ! ,
in the singular, dual and plural forms:
singular:
dual
:
plural :hu
hi +'o
hi + odo
de +'o
de +homl
ml +'o
ml + oThe forms of the imperative suffix require further discussion,
but stems are as the general ablaut rule would predict.
The infinitive is formed by the addition of the suffix -dl'
to the verb stem, and occurs in a variety of contexts. The oper­
ation of the general ablaut rule may be seen if we consider one
of these, where the verb occurs as the complement of korlhu 'be
afraid', as in ""I am afraid to go"". Objects of korlhu
occur in
the benefactive case, so the infinitive will be followed by the
benefactive case suffix hi'.
In languages like English, the in­
finitive is invariable, irrespective of the person and number of
the underlying subject. In Hua, the infinitive has to appear in
one of two forms in obedience to the general ablaut rule.korlhue
korlhane
'hi1korlhle

8.2.5.6Genitive: the qualifying caseThe genitive in Hua creates possessive phrases. In English
such a possessive phrase as ""the man's"" may function as either an
adjective or a noun:
It is the man's boat, (adjective)
It is the man's.
(noun)
In Hua, only the adjectival usage is possible. Since there are
no verbs or postpositions in Hua which require genitive govern­
ment, nor any absolutive constructions in the genitive, it follows
that the sole syntactic function of a noun in the genitive case
in Hua is to act as an adjective. Like the ergative, the geni­
tive has both singular and plural forms.
The unmarked genitive singular suffix -ma'
['ßa']) follows all common noun stems:
de + ma'
a' + ma'(fu)
([a'ßa']) (fu)(postglottal'the man's (pig)'
'the woman's (pig)*The genitive on proper names, unsuffixed kin terms and per­
sonal pronouns is 0:
dgai'
Buró'
dnogu'(na)
(fu)
(zu')'my (thing)'
'Büro's (pig)'
'my sister's son's (house)'Personal pronouns occur with a final /'/ in the genitive, but
since this sound occurs before other case affixes such as the lo­
cative and the benefactive as well, /'/ cannot be identified as
an allomorph of the genitive. Note that the final /'/ of geni­
tives does not coalesce with the first consonant of the following
word: dgai' fu does not become */dgaipu/, nor does kzo' ru'
'whose
axe' become */kzotuf/.
The distinction between long and short possessive suffixes
is neutralized when these are followed directly by the genitive
case marker: the short forms add -ma',
the regular form of the
genitive singular, and the long forms (which already end in -ma')239NOUN COMPLEXESadd 0. An alternative formulation would have the genitive singu­
lar ending -ma1 added consistently to both suffix types, with a
rule of obligatory haplology converting the ungrammatical se­
quence *ma'+ma' to /ma'/:
ete
+ 'di
+ ma'
nono' + 'dima' + ma'>/etedima'/
>/nonodima'/'my husband's'
'my maternal uncle's'Like the ergative plural suffixes, the regular genitive plural
ending -'i' may be added only to nouns which are animate. Nouns
which form their ""plural"" with one of the collective suffixes
do not need to occur with this suffix in order to
vza or vutavu
be followed by the genitive plural ending:
mna + ' i'
mna + vza + 'i''birds''
'flock of birds's'However, both proper nouns and kin terms, which occur with one of
the true pluralizing suffixes ra or Ki must occur with this suffix
in order to appear in the genitive plural:
Norope' + Ki + 'i'
nono ' + ' dima ' + ra + ' i'(*norope' + 'i')
'the Norope family's'
(*nono ' + ' dima ' + ' i ' ) 'my maternal uncles' 'Finally, the handful of common nouns with human referents

ral forms as well:people

lar genitive ending is simply added to the plural stem. In the
third and fourth, the genitive plurals could perhaps be viewed as
irregular reductions of * v e d e ' i and *ade'i'
f by a rule which con­
verted /*e'i'/
to /!'/• T h e same rule could apply in the deriva­
tion of the fifth and sixth forms above, where the genitive plu­
ral ending was suffixed directly to the singular stems bade and
abade.
Two of the above nouns, vi and ade, have a special form of
the genitive plural which marks person as well as number:240MORPHOLOGY

function as adjectives in the case above. There is evidence,
however, that they are really déverbal nouns which, like numerals,
locative expressions, and nouns in the absolutive-nominative case,
are able to occur as qualifiers.
Syntactically bivalent nouns like rori
'two' and du' + roga
'on the breast' are disambiguated by the presence of the potential
topic suffix -mo: without this suffix, they are able to act as
either nouns or verbs; with it, they are able to act only as nouns.
Relative clauses seem to be disambiguated in the same way:
followed by the potential topic suffix -mo, they cease to be rel­
ative clauses, and become conditionals:
hima ' + mo
(/hirriamo/)
'when he did it; given that he did it.'
hi sima'
+ mo (/hisimamo/)
'if he does it'
(The final glottal stop disappears before -mo for unmarked condi­
tionals: however, a rarely used conditional form, apparently syn­
onymous with the above, does not have such deletion: /himabo/.
In any case, the absence of the final glottal stop is so frequent,
though irregular, a phenomenon in Hua morphological alternations,
that it does not prevent the identification of relative clauses
and conditionals here.)
At this point, conditional clauses will be analyzed, on pure­
ly morphological grounds, as nominal expressions:264MORPHOLOGYRelative clauses seemingly differ from other bivalent nomi­
nal expressions in that they cannot function as nouns (i.e., as
conditional clauses), without the disambiguating suffix -mo: the
expression hima', by itself, cannot be a conditional clause.
Nevertheless, the distinction between relative clauses and other
bivalent nominal expressions is more apparent than real: all that
is necessary, apparently, is that the relative clause be followed
by some suffix to be a nominal expression, and most of the suffixes
with which it may cooccur are found on nouns.
An example of such a suffix is the restrictive quantifier
-Ko' 'only', before which the relative clause loses its final
glottal stop, and becomes an unambiguous conditional clause,
whether or not the restrictive quantifier is followed itself by
-mo:hisima'+ Ko'(+mo)(/hisimagobo/)'only if he comes'Other examples are the case suffixes, most of which may be
adjoined directly to the relative verb to create subordinate
clauses of various types:
Adessive/Allative:
Inessive/Illative:hima'
hima'+ ro'
+ vi''when he did it'
'while he was doing it'Comparative evidence from Gimi, spoken to the West of Hua,
strongly suggests that the purposive desinence -mi'3 is actually
a combination of the relative desinence -ma'3 and the benefactive
case affix -hi':
in Gimi, -mi ' 3 is translated by -maj + ke, where
-ma3 is cognate with the relative desinence, and -ke is the benefactive case affix.)PRENOMINAL QUALIFIERS265The frequently idiosyncratic meanings of relative clauses
with case affixes are discussed in more detail in section 13, be­
low. The existence of such clauses, in the meantime, leaves no
doubt concerning the fundamental nominal status of the relative
clause construction.
Relative clauses with the copula verbs bai- (animate), no(inan.) and the pseudo-copula verbs ro- 'be' and hu- 'do' may
undergo a process of relative clause reduction whereby the rela­
tivized form of the verb is deleted, leaving the complement of
the verb to stand before the noun it modifies as an apparent ad­
jective. None of these complements, however, is a true adjective:
all of them, like relative clauses, are nouns capable of acting
as qualifiers.

adjectives or adverbs: in Hua, they may be only nouns. Any noun
capable of acting as the complement of a copula verb is able to
act as the subject of a sentence, to occur with case affixes, and
so forth.
Relative clause reduction is also obligatory when the copula
verb is ro-.
This verb, whose principle lexical meaning is ""burn"",
functions as the perfective auxiliary. It also occurs as the
copula with a small number of complements, all of them pejorative
and expressive of physical decrepitude or stuntedness: among them
are Kosita
'old' (man), tava 'old1 (inanimate object), Kagia
'bald', KeBiri,
Keva 'stunted' (animal or vegetable), and fuipa'
'stunted' (vegetable). There are more, but the semantic homoge­
neity of the group seems quite evident.

case affixes and other suffixes characteristic of nouns, and all
of them are able to act as the subjects of sentences.
The verb hu- is the most interesting: in some cases, it is
obligatorily deleted, in other cases, optionally, and in yet
other cases, deletion is blocked. Constraints on deletion are in
part syntactic and morphological, but mainly they relate to the
meaning of the verb compound, and thus help us to define three
degress of adjective-ness in Hua.
Following are a list of compound verbs of the form N±hufor which deletion of the relative -hima'
is obligatory. It will
be noted that many of these verbs are ambiguously transitive or
intransitive, but that deletion is possible only when the verb is
intransitive:

(fin.A)No generalization which works to predict the necessity of one or
another of the enlarging suffixes is known.
This enlarging function need not be exercised where the mono­
syllabic stem is part of a compound noun phrase, since it will
lose its stress before a polysyllable, or rob a following monosyl­
lable of its stress by productive stress rules (cf. 4.3.4.1,
4.3.4.2). And indeed, in compound nouns, neither enlargement oc-243NOUN COMPLEXESIa 1
fu- iø > ±
\*mo]pigzu'
houseThe suffix -a is only optional, the suffix -mo prohibited.
Nevertheless, this stress-separation function will acount
for only part of the distribution of the syllable enlargements.
Their role before the (invariably unstressed) postnominal suf­
fixes (a) - (e) above is entirely mysterious.
Although the two suffixes are in free variation on monosyl­
lables, -a tends to occur most often on nouns uttered in isolation
(e.g. in elicitation, and in the vocative case), and is hence
called the citation suffix. The suffix -mo, on the other hand,
occurs most commonly on noun phrases in connected discourse, and
could therefore be called a connective particle. Neither of these
terms is entirely appropriate, as will emerge from a detailed
survey of the distribution of each.
8.2.7.1The citation suffix -aNoun stems ending in the vowel /a/, as noted, undergo rule
(53). Nouns ending in the sequence /...Va/ in the citation form
are thus susceptible to two different analyses: ...7-faor
...Va+a.
Where suffix -mo is in free variation with -a, both roots occur:
thus kekia+mo alternates with keki+mo, the basis for this varia­
tion being the ambiguous status of /kekia/: keki+a ~ kekia+a
'fence'.
In most nouns ending in /J/,
the final glottal stop becomes
/r/ before the citation suffix: a' + a /ara/ 'woman', ko' + a
/kora/ 'bamboo', okruma'+a
/okrumara/ 'sky'. (This change, it
should be noted, is phonetically irregular, and occurs only be­
fore the citation suffix.)
In about a dozen nouns, however, final /'/ becomes /n/ be­
fore the same suffix: ()za'+a
becomes /zana/ 'hand/. Following
is an exhaustive list of these nouns:
hani'
()hau'
OKanu'
OKia'
Kire'
Kora''night'
'liver'
'vein'
'foot, leg'
'corn'
'blood'mni'

'red pandanus'
'axe'
'hand, arm'244MORPHOLOGYFor one common noun, dti'
'morning', we find an / r ~ n/ alter­
nation before the citation suffix: /dtira~ dtina/.
The citation suffix is severely limited in its distribution.
It can occur only on common nouns and personal pronouns, never on
proper names or kin terms :d ai* - {mo}fu- ÇojBüro'- iIdttsa'a'pig, pork'
['Büro'mo)(*a )
- <
>'my sister'(male ego)(It is interesting to note that three kin terms ete 'husband',
bade 'boy, son', and abade 'girl, daughter', anomalous in ending
with a vowel and in taking the short form of the possessive suf­
fixes, are also anomalous in allowing the citation suffix -a:
ete-a,
etc.)
Moreover, the suffix is possible on such nouns only if none
of the suffixes of sections 8.2.1 to 8.2.7 (i.e. none of the suf­
fixes that precede the suffix -mo) are present: no nominal suffix
may precede it. Once again, the suffix -mo has a broader distri­
bution here, being able to follow almost all suffixes:(*a ]: mni'+ rva'- ■<Possessive : kra+ 'di- ir'my d o g 'Benefactive : kra+ hi'- <>'for the dog'Restrictive: kra
Quantifier+ Ko'- 1
^(*a 1
r'only the dog'Qualifierr(*a ]'plain water'^Finally, unlike the suffix -mo, it occurs rarely on nominal stems
of more than two syllables in length, and is almost impossible to
elicit for glottal stop-final polysyllables: the citation form of
a noun like nobuta'
'throat', for example, should be /nobutara/,
but this is almost never heard, while nobuta'+mo
(/nobutabo/) oc­
curs frequently.
It would seem, then, that the suffix -mo can occur in a vari-NOUN COMPLEXES245ety of contexts where -a cannot, but that the reverse is not true.
This is not the case. A characteristic and unique function of
the citation suffix is to form vocatives, to which we now turn.
8.2.7.1.1Formation of the vocative caseMorphologically, it is necessary to distinguish the vocative
of proper names and kin terms (Büro!; My son!) from that of common
nouns (Boy!; Down there!).
Proper names and kin terms (which may be followed by posses­
sive suffixes), form the vocative case by dropping the final glot­
tal stop and adding an optional final suffix -o. The function of
this final suffix is similar to that of the optional homophonous
suffix on imperatives: it marks a stem, otherwise uninflected, as
having the function of a complete utterance:

"13.2Noun forming suffixes
A noun may occur with a variety of inflectional suffixes,DERIVATIONAL MORPHOLOGY293outlined in section 8.2. The only one which uniquely limits the
syntactic function of this word to that of a noun as defined in
configuration III, however, is the potential topic suffix -mo.
Only one derivational
suffix is equally explicit: this is
the ending -bo' which occurs uniquely on deictic expressions: ma
'this, here'; ma+ bo' 'this one'; a'ina
'this, the same'; a'ina+
bo' 'the same one'.
Similarity of form and of function prompt the speculation
that -mo and -bo' are cognate.
Most derivational suffixes, like most inflectional suffixes,
mark a nominal constituent as bivalent: capable of- acting as
either a noun or an adjective.
13.3Bivalent nomino-adjectival suffixesInflectional suffixes which create constituents capable of
acting as either nouns or verbs include (on nouns) the suffix en­
largement -Ka on adessives and inessives and (on verbs) the rela­
tive ending -ma'3 and the infinitival ending -di'.
Three derivational suffixes, na,
seem to perform a similar function.
13.3.1the glottal stop, and 'a,Nominalizer naThe nominalizing morpheme na is actually the free-standing
pronoun ""thing"", and all cases of Root + na lexemes may be treated
as compounds. Since na is a noun phrase, it may occur as the head
noun with not only other nouns and quasi-adjectives, but also
with true adjectives. Those cases where a form A + na are simply
translated as ""an A thing"" are of no morphological interest: ex­
amples are words like nupa na 'a black thing', za'za'
na 'a long
thing' and haga na 'a sweet thing'.
It is the cases where A + na may not be so simply translated
which provide evidence for the grammaticization of this suffix.
Already noted are such nomina actionis as kakora na 'initiation'
'from Kakora 'initiated person', zga na 'possum hunt' from zga
'possum'. Similar to these are abstract nouns like siro na and
Kopa na 'pollution' from the quasi adjective siro
'dirty' and the
noun Kopa 'menstruation'; the noun dodi'
na 'food' f rom the infi­
nitive do + di'
'to eat'; and the noun do'a'do'
na 'everything,
the universe' from the disjunction do 'eat' and 'a'ïïdo
'not eat'.
Finally, there are cases where the root A in A + na is a
bound morpheme occurring in no other collocation. Examples in-294MORPHOLOGYelude be' + na 'price' (where the root be' may occur in other
words such as bekva
'ant' [Kva means ""insect"") and beptu
'vaginal
odor' (ftu means ""odor""), but no common meaning of he' in these
three putative compounds can be discerned.)
Note that ferafera
na 'a big thing' is syntactically regular,
but that there exists another form fera na 'greatly, very much'
which is not, inasmuch as it is built on a non-reduplicated form
of the adjective, and inasmuch as the head noun does not serve to
refer:abadekamoferana(mo)kosie'Your daughter has grown very big (or 'very much 1 ).'
13.3.2The glottal stopA possibly accidental function of the glottal stop is to mark
the constituent on which it occurs as something less than a com­
plete utterance. This function is the outcome of a number of ran­
dom processes that have been mentioned earlier in the grammar,
and are recapitulated here.
(a) No final verbal desinence with the exception of the
triply anomalous purposive desinence -mi'3
ends in the glottal
stop, and this desinence, as we have seen, marks utterances which
are entirely old information, and hence, by definition, topics.
(b) Almost all non-final verbal desinences (i.e., those
which create subordinate clauses of various types) do end in the
glottal stop: the only exceptions are the participial ending -Ka
and the anticipatory desinences on medial verbs.
(c) All verb stems are capable of acting as complete ut­
terances in the imperative mood. However, no verb stem ends in
the glottal stop.
(d) Nouns differ from verbs in that noun stems may end in
the glottal stop and proper names of people always end in this
sound. However, when they are in the vocative case (and thus,
syntactically, verbs) proper names lose their final glottal stop.
Common nouns ending in a glottal stop substitute for this final
glottal stop one of the consonants /r/ or /n/ in the vocative
case.
(e) All interjections are functionally verbs: some of them,
like ita
'mother' and avu 'father' are clearly related to ordina­
ry nouns, and probably originated as invocations. They differ
from the nouns from which they are derived, however, in not al­
lowing a final glottal stop: the nouns are ita'
and davu'.","[351, 352, 353]"
"279Syntactic definitions of the parts, of speechDefining morphological characteristics of the parts of speech
were outlined in sections 6 through 11. (The limited membership
of categories other than nouns and verbs is reflected in the com­
parative brevity of sections 9, 10, and 11.)
In Hua, as in many other languages, it is possible for nouns
to act as verbs and adjectives; conversely, it is possible for
verbs to act as nouns and adjectives. Adjectives have been de­
fined as the miniscule group of words which cannot act as either
nouns or verbs.
In sections 8 and 9, it was shown how nouns in the nominativeabsolutive, genitive, locative, and comitative cases, could act
as adjectives, and how nouns in the vocative case could act as
verbs. The notions ""act as N, V, A"" may be defined both by syn­
tactic configurations, and by the distribution of the potential
topic suffix -mo:
Non- noun functionsNoun functionsMore generally, the potential topic suffix may follow any con­
stituent irrespective of its label, occurring in a configuration
like III, and may not follow any constituent, irrespective of its
morphological label, occurring in a configuration like I or II.
Configurations I, II, and III define the syntactic categories
verb (or sentence), qualifier (or adjective), and noun (or possi­
ble topic).
It is apparent that the morphological and syntactic criteria
for nouns, verbs and adjectives do not agree: note particularly
that the syntactic class adjective
is much larger than the morpho­
logical class adjective.
Nevertheless, the disagreement is not
as great as it may at first appear to be.
Morphological NP which act as VP occur with some of the same
inflectional endings found on VP: thus, it is no accident that280MORPHOLOGYthe predicate marker -e (on vocatives), the interrogative marker
-ve, and the vocative marker -(o)
(on vocatives of proper names)
are identical, respectively, to the final desinences -e^,
-ve^,
and the imperative ending
-(o).
Conversely, morphological VP acting as NP (nominalizations),
occur not only with the potential topic suffix -mo, but with a
variety of other inflectional endings characteristic of NP as de­
fined in section 8.
The purpose of this section will be to demostrate the coin­
cidence of morphological and syntactic criteria for nominaliza­
tions, and to justify the label ""potential topic"" marker for the
suffix -mo. In section 7.2.2.2 are outlined all the verbal de­
sinences which create subordinate clauses. They are, in order of
presentation Relative -ma'^r
Participial -Ka, Infinitive
-di',
Gerundial -mo, Gerundial -Kasi',
Purposive -mi'3,
Conditional
-mamo3, Irrealis Conditional -hipana-j,
and Medial -nay.
All but
a few of these may occur with the potential topic suffix -mo.
To deal with the exceptions first: the conditional -mamo3
may not occur with following -mo: the reason suggested is that
conditional clauses are in fact formed by a compound desinence
which itself contains the suffix -mo, and differs from relative
clauses in only this detail: relative clauses function as adjec­
tives and cannot take the suffix, while conditional clauses, semantically identical, but dominated directly by the node S, are
syntactically noun phrases, and thus do take the suffix. (cf..
section 9.3.1).
Gerunds in -mo also fail to occur with this suffix for the
same reason. They consist of the verb stem followed directly by the
potential topic suffix -mo, and are thus nominalizations. Com­
parative evidence for this contention comes from Gimi, where all
same-subject medial verbs have the form V + me {me being cognate
with Hua mo ~ me).
It is sufficient to show that medial verbs
are nominalizations to establish gerunds in -mo, which have simi­
lar functions, as comparable nominalizations.
Finally, participles in -Ka fail to occur with -mo.
This is
predictable where they act as adjectives on a head noun Kta'
(cf. 7.2.2.2.2.1), but inexplicable where they apparently act as
nouns before 'a'#hu(cf. 7.2.2.2.2.2). They constitute the only
mystery in this section.
Infinitives in -di'
relative clauses:
ebgi + di'(*mo)fail to allow -mo where they function aszga'Possum which he killed'SYNTACTIC DEFINITIONS OF THE PARTS OF SPEECH281but allow the suffix where they act as subjects or objects of
sentences:
va
+ di'
(mo)
soko
sleep (inf.) (p-t.) good
'To sleep is a good thing.'na
+ mo
thing (p.t.)ne
+e
be 3 (fin.A)Moreover, infinitives, like relative clauses, may be followed
directly by case affixes to form a variety of subordinate clause
types:
Allative
: hu + di' + ro'
'at doing it1 as in
Mna
+ mo
fuvu ± hu + di'
+ ro'
soko ± hi + e
flute (p.t.) blow do (inf.) (all.) good do 3 (fin.A)
'He is good at blowing the flute.'
Benefactive: hu + di' + hi'
'of doing it' as in
Fina -h mo
hu + di'
+ hi'
kor i ± hi
+ e
fight (p.t.) do (inf.) (ben.) flee do 3 (fin.A)
'He was afraid of fighting.'
Once again, the meanings of all of these constructions may be
dealt with in detail later: for the time being, their existence
is sufficient to establish the nominal nature of infinitival
clauses.
Gerunds in -Kasi'
occur with -mo, but with no other apparent
mark of nominal status, such as case affixes. The reason may be
that the gerundial desinence is again a compound one, consisting
itself of -Ka plus the benefactive case suffix -hi'.
Evidence
for this conjecture is, however, slim: gerunds in -Kasi',
on one
reading, are mutually substitutable for nominalized relative
clauses in the adessive/allative, i.e. verbs in -ma'^ + ro'.
Since in yet other nominalized relative clauses, as yet unmentioned, the case affixes -hi'
and -ro'
are mutually substitutable,
it is possible that the interchangeability of -Kasi'
and
-ma'+ro'
is evidence of the same freedom. This is possible if -Kasi ' is
analyzed as the quasi-relative participai desinence -Ka +
hi'.
Medial verbs are the most interesing of all subordinate verb
types. Whether they are coordinate, subordinate, same-subject,
or change-of-subject forms, all medial verbs may cooccur with the
potential topic suffix -mo:
Subordinate:
himamogana
Coordinate :
Same subject
: hurona
Changed subject: higana(+mo)'he did and he...'(+mo)
(+mo)'he.j_ did and he^... 1
'he- did and he....'","[338, 339, 340]"
"Nouns occur with topic suffixesIn Hua, noun phrases occur with the suffixes -mo and -ve of
which the second (the actual topic marker) may occur only if pre­
ceded by the first (the potential topic marker). All nouns imme­
diately but not exhaustively dominated by S may occur with -mo.
In Gimi, the suffix -ve seems to correspond to both -mo and
-ve of Hua. In Siane, the single suffix -ma corresponds to both.
Gahuku has -mo' (Deibler 1976: 50) and Fore -pa (Scott 1973: 16).
Among the languages of the Eastern Family, Usarufa has -ma
as a nominal suffix on nouns (Bee 1973: 220). From Bee's descrip­
tion, it contrasts with the ""predicative"" suffix -e, the first
being found on topics, the second on comments, of verbless sen­
tences. Auyana has a suffix -maN which McKaughan calls the ""nom-xlivINTRODUCTION
inative"" case marker. He himself provides evidence, however, that
it cannot be a case affix, but rather has a function similar to,
In the first place, it
if not identical with, that of Hua -mo.
cooccurs with other case affixes such as the inessive: ana + piN
+maN (=bamboo + inessive + maN) ""in the bamboo"". Second, it can
occur only on the head noun of a compound NP (i.e., like Hua -mo
it can follow only NP which are directly dominated by S ) .
Among the languages of the West-Central family, Kewa has the
topic suffix -re (Franklin 1971: 62).
No similar morpheme has been reported (as far as I know) for
other ENGH languages, but the feature is one which clearly is at­
tested outside the ENGH, and even outside the TNGP.
A topic suffix on NP is encountered in Wojokeso, a TNGP lan­
guage of the Angan family (West 1973: 4, 22); and Daga, a TNGP
language of the Dagan family (Murane 1974: 16). It is also cer­
tainly attested in Bilua, a language of the East Papuan Phylum
(E. Wheeler, personal communication).
A widespread secondary feature with which this morpheme is
associated is the marking of protasis clauses in conditional sen­
tences. Noting this secondary function in Kewa, Franklin (1971:
120) comments that ""any sentence whose topic and comment are ex­
pounded by verbal clauses has the semantic interpretation of a
condition ... the topic has the subfunction of protasis; the com­
ment, the subfunction of apodosis"". Similar observations are im­
plicit in the discussions of BenaBena (Young 1964: 46, 51), Fore
(Scott 1973: 16) and Daga (Murane 1974: 15-6).
If the categories of topic
and protasis were semantically
unrelated, their conflation in various languages of New Guinea
might provide evidence for their genetic relationship. In fact,
however, they are related and morphologically identical in a num­
ber of clearly unrelated languages, among them Chinese (Chao 1968:
81-120, passim).
The nature of their relationship is extensively
discussed in Haiman 1978.","[45, 46]"
"365Agreement phenomenaThe most pervasive syntactic fact in Hua is the rich and
complex agreement system whereby verbs agree with their subjects,
objects, and indirect objects, medial verbs agree with the sub­
jects of following verbs, and nouns agree with their possessors and
referents with respect to both person and number. The mechanics
of these agreement processes are the subject of this section.
The point of view adopted here is that all marks of person
and number of subject and object on verbs, and of possessor on
nouns, are the result of a transformation: that, while the surface
structure of a sentence may consists of only a single verb, its
deep structure will have as many NP as the verb has semantic argu­
ments; and that the reason a verb may function as a complete sen­
tence is that unstressed pronoun arguments are automatically
deleted once agreement has occurred.
The syntactic motivation for this position is that agreement
rules are necessary to mark agreement with stressed pronouns and
non-pronominal arguments in any case:
46a)Dgaimo d+ge
'He saw me.'b)Vedemo p+ge
'He saw the men.'",[424]
"258MORPHOLOGYAny common noun may be preceded by bgo'.
However, uninflected nouns, particularly if they are monosyllabic, are more often
followed by it:
bgo' usi
bgo'de~ usi
~ debgo'
bgor'some (more) tobacco'
'some man'At first appearance, this would simply lead to the identification
of bgo' as a postnominal qualifier like rgepa
'fine' and rva'
'plain, ordinary'. What distinguishes it from these words, how­
ever, is the fact that the noun stem it follows may itself occur
with the potential topic suffix -mo:
usi
usi(+mo)
bgo'
(*mo) + rgepa'some (more) tobacco'
'fine tobacco'Assuming that the distribution of the potential suffix outlined
in section 8.2.8.2, above, is correct, this would indicate that
bgo' is not a suffix on the noun, but a separate word. The evi­
dence above suggests that the label on this word is that of a
noun phrase.
9.1.2Definite deicticsDefinite deictics express distance, visibility, and direc­
tion. The basic set of these ""positional"" demostratives is
given in the table below:Close
DistantLevelUphillDownhillma; na; ora
bira;
burabuga
bigamuna
minama corresponds roughly to ""this"" (closer to speaker), while na
corresponds to ""that"" (closer to hearer). Ora is a general term
in which this distinction is neutralized. Bira refers to things
not seen, while bura refers to visible things. There is some
disagreement on the meanings of the forms biga/bugaf
and
mina/muna.
For some informants, the former term in each pair denotes an un­
seen referent.
In addition to the positional deictics, there are two which
signify identity of referent to some previously named entity, ir­
respective of position. They are (ha)re'
'same' and a'ina
'this,
same'. They seem almost interchangeable, although the first
emphasises identity more than the second (""this same"" as opposed
to ""this""), and the second occurs in some idioms which are pecul-PRENOMINAL QUALIFIERS259iar to it: an example is the formulaic a'ina+'a
na+e 'that's all'
(literally, 'it's thisness is it'), used to finish stories.
All of the deictics of this section with the exception of
hare'
are clearly nominal expressions in that they may be followed
directly by locative case suffixes to form adverbs of place, di­
rection, and movement from:
ma +ro'
buga+vi'
mina+roti'~ ma + roga
~ buga+vinga
~ mina+rogariti''here, hither'
'into up there; up there'
'from down there'Before all other case suffixes which confer a nominal func­
tion (nominative, benefactive, ergative, and comitative), the
deictics must be followed by a nominalizing suffix -bo1
(perhaps
cognate with the potential suffix -mo, but a cooccurring and hence
distinct entity):
Nominative : ma+bo' (+mo)
Ergative
: ma+bo'+mamu'
(+mo)
Benefactive: ma+bo'+hi'(+mo)
Comitative : ma+bo'+Ki'(+mo)(/ma bobo/)
'this (one)'
(/mabobamubo/)'this (one) (erg.)'
(/mabosibo/) 'for this one'
(/mabokibo/) 'with this one'All of these demostrative pronouns formed by the addition of
-bo' have inanimate referents: ma+bo' 'this one' can refer to ob­
jects, events, or situations, but never persons, or even animals.
It is perhaps for this reason that such pronouns do not occur
in the genitive case, the possessor being always, in Hua, an ani­
mate, more frequently human, being.
All polysyllabic deictics with the exception of a'ina
and
hare'
'same', form vocatives by the addition simply of the predi­
cate suffix -e (given that this suffix must follow the citation
suffix -a, the presence of this morpheme is assumed here as well,
although, since all the deictics occurring in the vocative end in
/a/, the citation suffix never appears in actual pronunciation):
mina
bira(+a) + e
(+a) + e'you down there'
'you unseen person over there'Monosyllabic deictic na means ""thus, or so"" and occurs as a
separate noun with this meaning :
na oe
na baipe
nathie'thus I have come'
'thus are you here?'
'he did thus'The other monosyllabic deictic ma means ""here"":260MORPHOLOGY

"Noun complexesThe noun complex, like the verb complex, is a morphological­
ly defined entity, a single word. Unlike the verb complex, it is
not necessarily an immediate constituent of the sentence in which
it appears: its syntactic function is to act as the head of a noun
phrase, which is such a constituent. While a noun complex may be
a noun phrase, it may also be preceded by a number of qualifiers
which are separate words. By the criteria we shall adopt, many
of these qualifiers are themselves noun complexes, and only a
very small number of them are adjectives: nevertheless, they will
be discussed together with adjectives in section 9, below.
The typical noun complex consists of a stem with a variety
of affixes. Section 8.1 will present an outline of the variety
of nominal stems, while 8.2 and 8.3 will deal with the suffixes
and prefixes respectively.
8.1Internal structure of the stemIn the same way that the minimal noun phrase is a noun com­
plex, the minimal noun complex is the nominal stem. Among stems,
we may distinguish among pronouns, proper names and kin terms,
and common nouns.
8.1.1Pronouns
The free-standing personal pronouns in Hua are
Singular
1. dgai
2. kgai
3. KaiDual
1. ra'agai
2/3. pa'agaiPlural
rgai
pgaiIt is easy to analyse these as bimorphemic words, consisting of
the personal pronoun prefixes (cf. p.199 ) and an invariable root
Kai,
Unfortunately, this root does not seem to occur either in
isolation or with any other affix which would allow us to identify
its ""underlying"" meaning in Hua. It is possible that the root oc­
curs as the first syllable of Kaiga,
a suffix added to proper
names to mark them as geographical place names (e.g. Huva + Kaiga
'Lufa', or, literally, 'Hua place').
Before a number of suffixes, among them the citation suffix
-a, the restrictive quantifier Ko' 'only', the potential topic
marker -mo, the ergative case suffixes -mu' and -vibamu',
and the216MORPHOLOGYcomitative suffix -Ki'
'with', the pronouns occur in the form
shown. Before all other suffixes, they add a final glottal stop,
which is then absorbed into the suffix by one of the rules of
coalescence (e.g. Kai' + ro' becomes /kaito'/ 'to him' by rule
(12); Kai' -f hi1 becomes /kaisi 1 / 'for him' by rule (16).) The
existence of two forms Kai ~ Kai'
'3sg.', etc., will be considered
as an example of the phenomenon of the fleeting glottal stop (cf.
2.2.3.4).
8.1.2Proper names and kin termsIn Hua, as in English, many proper names are originally com­
mon nouns, but they differ from these in that they occur invari­
ably with a final glottal stop (.cf. SSC. 3,4.2.1.1). As in Eng­
lish, names distinguish gender.
While there seems to be no strong taboo on the use of person­
al names, few people are either referred to or addressed by their
""formal"" names, except by their parents. Common alternatives in­
clude nicknames, teknonyms, and ""kin"" terms. Most Hua males at
least have one or more nicknames (brisu'()Ki
'laugh name 1 ). For
example, my principal informant Kamani (from Siane kamani 'hoop
pine') was alternatively referred to or addressed as
Kirino'
'big snake', or, less respectfully, as Kakapu'
'snail'. An older
man with the same name was occasionally referred to as ropa '
Kamani'
'elder Kamani', but commonly and disrespectfully address­
ed as aika teridi'
'You with the stuck-out anus'. The use of
such nicknames, of course, implies a certain degree of familiari­
ty. While almost all males were found on elicitation to have
nicknames, these names were in common repeated use for only a few.
Most adults were known by their teknonyms.
For official purposes (such as tax rolls and employment re­
cords) , Hua people have two names, of which the second is the name
of the father, or, in the case of a married woman, of the husband.
Thus, my principal informant was Kamani' Kutane',
and his wife
and daughter were Korua' Kamani' and Varere'
Kamani'
respectively.
While it is common for a person to give the names of his father
for purposes of identification, it is doubtful whether the prac­
tice of using two names in this way predates contact with Europe­
ans. There is however, another far more common kind of namegiving which is undoubtedly of greater antiquity, whereby a person
is known, not by the name of his father, but by the name of his
children. Kamani's wife, for example, is commonly referred to as
Var ere'
ira'
'Varere mother'. Kamani himself could be referred to
as Varere'
eva'
'Varere father'. Note that the words ira'
'moth­
er ' and eva'
'father' in such teknonyms occur without an internalNOUN COMPLEXES217glottal stop. There is thus a distinction between the common den­
ser iption Var ere1 e'va1
'Varere's father', and the proper name.
So common is the use of teknonyms for adults that they may
be bestowed as proper names on children. A man in Sara village
who in fact was childless had the name Kusiri'
eva'
'Kusiri fa-:
ther ' , by which he had been known since infancy.
Most common as terms of address, though not of reference,
for members of the same village or between affines, are a set of
terms which may be labelled ""kin"" terms. By this are meant all
proper names of shifting reference, whose reference is determined
by the nature of the relationship between ego and alter.
Phonetically, kin terms are similar to proper names in that
they generally occur with a final glottal stop. There are only
three kin terms which do not: bade (from ba'± de 'woman man')
'boy, son, child', abade (from a' ±ba' ± de 'woman woman man 1 )
'girl, daughter', and ete 'husband'. These three names also dif­
fer from other kin terms, and from other proper names in the na­
ture of the suffixes with which they occur, and thus are syste­
matically anomalous.
All of them are reckoned as inalienably possessed and thus
occur with possessive pronoun prefixes wherever prefixation is
allowed by syllable structure constraints or by the marked sylla­
ble rule. They fall into five classes.

"DISCOURSE
20.2467TopicsThere are two topic markers in Hua: the allative suffix -ro'
~ -roga,
and -ve.
These contrast with each other and correspond
to the two definitions which have been frequently assigned to topics
in the linguistic literature.
as a case affix, is
The adessive-allative suffix -ro' ~ -roga,
mutually exclusive with other non-null case affixes. As a conse­
quence, it can appear only on noun phrases with case affix zero,
that is, on nouns in the nominative case. Only one noun phrase per
clause may be topicalized by this suffix. Such a noun phrase is
marked by the allative as contrastive, the expression NP + ro'
being translatable as ""as for NP"".

"291Derivational morphologyDepending on the inflectional suffixes with which it occurs,
every nominal and verbal stem in Hua is able to appear as a noun,
verb, or adjective.
This polyvalence, defined in the syntactic configurations I,
II, III, is predominantly syntactic: for example, a proper noun
like Kamani' may act as a sentence in the vocative case, but it
cannot mean the same thing as a verb; it cannot describe an event
or a state.
In addition to the inflectional suffixes described in the
sections above, which create syntactic nouns, verbs, and adjec­
tives, Hua also has a relatively small number of derivational suf­
fixes which create lexical
nouns and verbs. Like derivational
suffixes generally, these are of limited productivity and varia­
ble meaning.
In opening a discussion of these suffixes, it is useful to
restate the traditional distinction that exists between deriva­
tion and compounding. Given a lexeme of the form A + B, this
lexeme is called a compound if both A and B are capable of acting
as independent words: it is called a derived form if one of the
morphemes (in the case of Hua, always the second) is a bound mor­
pheme .
It should be noted that by this criterion, Hua is rich in
compounds, and relatively poor in derivations. Corresponding to
such familiar notions as agent and action nominalizing suffixes
(English -er and -tion,
for example), Hua uses the free standing
nouns de 'man' and na 'thing1: thus, for example,
rusa 'white magic, healing': rusa
kakora
'initiated person': kakorade
na'medicine man, doctor';
'initiation (ceremony)'.",[350]

tinaBoth dialects have the same system of cases, but the morpho­
logy of the two systems differs. In Move, both genitive and
ergative case affixes are -ma' (Renck 1975: 35), while in Hua they
are distinct (genitive -ma', ergative -(ma)mu')
. In Move, the
comitative is ' e' ~ 'ese' (Renck 17), while in Hua it is -gi'. In
Move, the benefactive is -e' ~ -se', while in Hua it is -hi'

with inanimate nouns, the latter with animates. No such distinc­
tion is observed between the Hua cognates -roti ' and rogari ' (al­
though in both dialects only the shorter form is possible as the
marker of the instrumental case).
Two of the most striking differences in the verb complex are
significant. Move has a past tense suffix du- which is absent in
Hua (although the medial auxiliary -to- may be cognate with it,
cf. 7.2.1.9.3), and Move, unlike Hua, prefixes
the progressive
auxiliary verb (Hua bai: Move no).

stems are derived nouns, which must carry the verbalizing morpheme
hu-.
Frequently, such reduplicated verb stems take a final glot­
tal stop:

'scrabble in mud'

glottal stop may account for the frequent though sporadic alter­
nation of the sound sequences /'/ and /na/ noted at various
points throughout this grammar: it becomes a case of analogical
overgeneralization.
13.3.3The suffix'aOf all nominalizing suffixes, this is semantically the most
irregular. Added to adjectives and deictics, it often corresponds
to the identity of sense pronoun ""one""; added to nouns, it corre­
sponds to abstract noun-forming suffixes like -hood.
But in many
cases, it is idiosyncratic: so much so, that it is impossible to
assign to it a single underlying meaning, or even to be sure that
the meanings listed below are associated with a single morpheme,
or a number of homophones.
13.3.3.1On adjectives and quasi-adjectivesThe suffix may appear on two true adjectives (or rather, on
two true adjective roots),
*fera
'big' (only the reduplicated
'small'. On
form of which occurs as an adjective), and havána
these adjective roots, it is the identity of sense pronoun:
fera + 'a
havana + 'a'a big one'
'a small one'On the quasi-adjectival (actually bound nominal) roots ogo'
'short' and za'za'
'long', the compound suffix na + 'a serves the
same function:
ogo' + na + ''a
za'za
+ na + 'a'a short one'
'a long one'296MORPHOLOGYOn the other adjectives and quasi-adjectives listed below,
the suffix -'a occurs with a variety of unpredictable meanings:
Root
hauva
ru'
hava'Root + 'a'new'
'different,
other'
'bad'hauva'a
ru'a'(too) early; early days'
'again'hava'a'nothing; just; unaffected'Hauva'a (mo) ne + e
'It's early days yet.'
Ru'a
(mo) rmi + e
'He went down again.'
Hava'a (mo)
vo + (o)I
'Just (go to) sleep!'
Among the pejorative predicate nominals occurring as the
complement of TO- are several which cannot occur as free-standing
nouns in any other context. They are uva' 'overripe, shrivelled';
tava 'old' (referring to inanimate objects); fuipa'
'stunted';
Keva 'stunted'. In order to function as nouns elsewhere, these
nouns must occur with the suffix -'a, which may here be glossed
again as the identity of sense pronoun 'one'.

"8.2Nominal suffixes
Generally speaking, nominal suffixes are optional, mutually221NOUN COMPLEXESindependent, and occur in the order indicated in the schema below:
Noun Complexo (prefixes) Stem (Collective 1) (qualifier)
(possessive) (Collective 2) (pronominal
apposition) case (restrictive quantifier)^(citation suffix) J. r, .
[(conj.)JA possible diagnostic for nominal stems is the fact that they
must occur with some case affix, but since the nominative case
affix is generally null, this is not an infallible criterion.
Some complications in the relative ordering and cooccurrence of
these suffixes will be dealt with as they arise.
8.2.1The expression of quantity: collective suffixesAmong personal pronouns, three numbers, singular, dual, and
plural, are distinguished. However, these pronouns may have only
human referents: it is impossible to use Kai '3sg.' meaning 'it',
or pgai '2/3pl.' referring to clouds, mountains, or pigs.
Among nouns, the expression of plurality or collectivity is
more complex and it is necessary to distinguish between common
nouns on the one hand, and proper names and kin terms on the other.
8.2.1.1Common nounsThe most frequent common nouns with human referents have
genuine plurals, all of which are irregular:person
man
woman
boy
girlSingularPluralKnu; frosa
de; vi
a'; ba'
bade
abadenaga '
vede;viadebadevede
abadevedeAll but the first of these allow a dual as well, which is formed
by adding rori
'two' as a suffix to the post-glottalized singular
stem. For example, the dual of de 'man' is de' +rori /detori/
1
two men'.
Other common nouns form their plurals in one of two ways,
depending on whether they end in a vowel or the glottal stop.
Common nouns ending in a vowel add either the suffix vza222MORPHOLOGY'mouth', or vutavu
(no independent occurrences). While the two
suffixes are entirely interchangeable on elicitation, vza is more
common with animals and inanimate objects, vutavu
with garden
plants: mna+vza 'flock of birds'; bza + vutavu
'lot of sweet po­
tatoes ' .
A small number of vowel - final common nouns form plurals by
reduplication: zapu 'bone' zaputapu
'lot of bones'; aitene
'old
woman', aitenetbatene
'old women'.
Glottal stop-final common nouns undergo reduplication where­
by
a) in polysyllables, the first syllable is replaced by a$;
b) in monosyllables, the root is preceded by a$
in reduplication. Representative polysyllablic stems include
eva'
'rock, stone', eva'tava'
'rocks, stones'; huga'
'frog'
huga'±aga'
'frogs'; Kire'
'corn' Kire' tare'
'lots of corn';
vesnu'
'kind of insect' vesnu' asnu'
'insects'. Representative
monosyllables include Ku' 'cloth, bag' Ku'agu'
'clothes'; Ko'
'bamboo' Ko'ago'
'lots of bamboo'.
Unusual and irregular collective forms for bza ' sweet potato'
and ati
'fig' use the -Ku'agu'
form, itself the root + reduplica­
tion collective form of Ku' 'clothes, bags', as a collective suf­
fix:
bzagu'agu'
atigu'agu''lots of sweet potatoes'
'lots of figs'Both suffixation and reduplication express collectivity or
quantity rather than simple plurality.
Plurality, as such, is not an obligatory grammatical category
on common nouns in Hua. The word mna, for example, may mean ei­
ther ""bird"" or ""birds"". The suffix vza, which may follow such a
noun, is really inappropriate unless there are a flock of birds:
it would be wrong to refer to two birds as mnavza.
Similarly,
huga'aga'
can refer to a colony of frogs, or a bagful of frogs,
but not to two frogs.
Moreover, it is clear that both the devices of reduplication
and suffixation are available to mass nouns like Kire'
'corn' and
frava
'grease, fat', which cannot be said to have plurals at all.
It is possible that the suffixes vza and vutavu
should be
regarded as head nouns, and expression such as mnavza, as compound
nouns. The stress patterns are ambiguous. If vza, for example,
were either a suffix or a nominal head, it would not receive
stress. If vutavu
were a suffix, it would never receive stress;
if a head noun in a compound, it would always receive stress, rob-NOUN COMPLEXES223bing a preceding monosyllable of stress. Two pronunciations are
possible for words like bzavutavu
'lots of sweet potatoes';
[bzavutavu] and
[bzavutavu].
8.2.1.2Plurality on proper names and kin termsKin terms and proper names are united in their expression of
collectivity. The suffix -Ki, identical with the symmetrical con­
junction ""and"" (and almost certainly cognate with the identical
'peo­
word in Siane meaning ""group"", which translates Hua naga'
ple') forms the collective for both. Before this suffix, both
kin terms and common proper nouns lose their final glottal stop.
epva'
+ Ki
Norope' + Ki> /epvagi/
> /noropegi/'their fathers'
'Norope and his family; the
Norope family'.","[279, 280, 281, 282]"
"363TRANSITIVITYIn English, the ""because
"" clause is identifiable, trivially,
as the cause clause. It is also clearly not the subject of the
sentence in which it occurs. In Hua, the cause clause, occurring
with the ergative case inflection, shares the morphology of the
subject of a transitive verb:
45Mni'doma'na+mu'dnu'tgieNo such transitive verb, of course, appears in the surface struc­
ture of this sentence. On could posit an abstract verb ""cause""
and assign (42) the structureNP (S)NP (0)
1Mni domanamu'dnu'tgieV
(cause)On nominalized sentences as on ordinary noun phrases, the er­
gative case inflection is optional: further evidence beyond mor­
phological identity that the suffix we are dealing with in the two
contexts is the same one.
In summary, the functions of the -mu' inflection in Hua are
varied, but the best single approximation to a definition of this
ending is that it is an ergative case ending. Among the more or
less undesirable consequences of this position, however, are the
fact that the inflection can appear on the subjects of unambig­
uously intransitive
verbs of the form NP±hu- (if the meanings of
these verbs are to be unchanged), and the fact that its appearance
on nominalized clauses forces us to posit an unrealized causative
verb.
Is Hua, then, an ergative language? Yes, but to a very mild
extent.
Morphologically, subjects of intransitive verbs and objects
of transitive verbs are grouped together in their inability to
occur with a -mu' inflection, and opposed to the subjects of
transitive verbs, which can occur with such a suffix.
Syntactically, however, it is fairly clear that subjects,
whether of transitive or intransitive verbs, are grouped together
and opposed to objects. Subjects of verbs cause one kind of verb
agreement, expressed in a set of root alternations and suffixes on
the verb; objects, whether direct or indirect, cause another kind
of verb agreement, expressed in a set of prefixes on the verb.
The only syntactic fact which might support the claim that
Hua was an ergative language is the fact, already noted, that364SYNTAXthere exist a large number of transitive impersonal verbs, which
correspond to intransitive verbs in English. That the experiencer
of verbs of physical and emotional state is treated as the object
of such verbs in Hua, unlike English, suggests that to a modest
extent, and with a restricted set of verbs, Hua is syntactically
grouping together the single arguments of one-place predicates
(i.e. subjects of intransitive verbs) and the object complements
of two place predicates (i.e. objects of transitive verbs).","[421, 422, 423]"

Only the -di'
relative may occur in the vocative case: as
noted, this constitutes some evidence that it is more ""noun-like""
than the -ma'
relative.
A complete paradigm, in which all case affixes are repre­
sented, occurs only for -ma'3 relatives with the nominalizing suf­
fix -na.
The suffix -na is ambiguous: as noted, it may be analyzed as
the head noun ""thing"", or it may be a derivational suffix. In
this section we are concerned only with the meanings of construc­
tions in which -na occurs with the latter function.","[358, 359]"
"Further details attest to the intimate semantic connection between
hu- and hau-.
For example, a large number of impersonal verbs
occur in two forms: NP + hu and NP + ()hau-.
The only difference
in their meaning is that of expressed transitivity:VERB COMPLEXES213buko hu 'be hot'
contrasts, with buko ()hau- 'feel hot';
f tu hu 'smell'
""
""
f tu
()hau- ' smell something '
haga hu 'be sweet'
""
""
haga ()hau- 'taste sweet to one'
Kta hu 'be heavy'
""
""
Kta
()hau- ' be heavy f or one 1
In at least one transitive verb, two forms are in free vari­
ation: ""catch"" can be represented by either ()tva hu or tva
()hau.
Finally, in related languages of the area, the two verbs are
similar or identical. This is less impressive in a language like
Gimi, where the same etymon ho- renders both ""please"" and ""do"",
since cognates of homonyms are likely to be homonyms or identical
in any case. It is more striking in Siane, where the verbs are
ro- 'do' and eDo- 'please', and the suppletive alternant of ""do""
in the negative is aDo— eDo-. Here superficial similarity cannot
be attributed to cognation with a pair of homonyms, but argues
for underlying similarity of meaning.
There is a major apparent syntactic problem in identifying
hu- and ()hau- in compound verbs of the form Root + verb: ()NP + hu,
in which the pronoun object prefix precedes the NP is opposed to
NP + ()hau,
in which it precedes the verb. Perhaps, it could be
argued, this superficial distinction reflects a major difference
between hu- and ()hau-.
Given that the object prefix pronoun pre­
cedes the verb in all cases, the syntactic structure of ()NP + hu
is that of (1), while that of NP + ()hau is that of (2):Then, in impersonal verbs of the form illustrated at the bottom of
'cold', Kosa 'falling down', and
page 212, the root nouns fugo'na
their like are the subjects of transitive verbs.
There is syntactic evidence, however, that the analysis (2)
is incorrect. If it were correct, then the nouns fugo'na
'cold',
etc., should be able to appear with the ergative case suffix -mu ' r
reserved for the subject of transitive verbs. In fact, they never
can:
Fugo'na (**mu')
'He has a cold.'haie.","[271, 272]"
"To the MSR there exists one exception: words whose initial
syllable is /au/ invariably allow préfixâtion; words whose ini­
tial syllable is /ai/ sometimes do. Whether or not such words
allow prefixation in the latter case cannot be predicted. Some

'caress,
fondle, pat (a child or an animal)', which may allow prefixation
for some speakers.
Verbs and nouns which require prefixation on the basis of
their meaning but are phonologically prohibited from doing so by
either the syllable structure constraints or the MSR may resort
to a number of periphrastic devices whereby the categories of hu­
man object and inalienable possessor are expressed. Some of these
devices are common to both verbs and nouns; others are limited to
verbs, and others are limited to nouns. In the following sec­
tions, all constructions will be reviewed that are available to
verbs.
7.3.4.1No marking of object on verbThree very common transitive verbs, bro 'put, procreate',
do 'eat', and ai 'bash' simply do not allow the human object to
be expressed as an affix on the verb. The person of the object202MORPHOLOGYcan be expressed only as. a full noun or pronoun, a separate word
in the sentence in which these verbs occur:
rgaimo
bre
'He fathered us; She bore us.f
dgaimo
bre
f
He fathered me; She bore me. '•
This option is available for only three verbs, and for no nouns.
7.3.4.2 To- support on verbs
The verb to- 'leave, put, abandon', allows prefixation. Its
most important syntactic function is to act as a support verb
which carries not only the personal pronoun prefixes but also all
auxiliaries and personal desinences on transitive verbs which do
not allow prefixation. In the examples below, the forms in the
left hand column represent such verbs as they would be if they
were prefixed. All of them are ungrammatical. The right hand
column lists the same verbs in the same tense and form with the
support verb to^.

Huga' no'aima'

There is a morpheme-by-morpheme correspondence between these con­
structions:
a)
b)V + Ka
Kta'
V + ma ' 3 nahu
huVERB COMPLEXES173The analysis of (b) is fairly straightforward: nahu- is a verbal
compound like okemo hu 'song do' consisting of the noun na 'thus,
this, thing' and the verbalizer hu- 'do'. V + ma'^ is a relative
or complement clause on the head noun phrase na.
Therefore, the
entire clause hama' nahu'as they do, you do thus' has the struc­
tureGiven the parallelism of (a) and (b), it is proposed that they
have the same syntactic structure: in this case -Ka like ¿na'3
will be identified as an adjectival desinence that creates com­
plement clauses. (Later on, it will be possible to show that a
homonymous, perhaps identical suffix has the same adject realiza­
tion function when added to noun phrases in the locative and
inessive cases, cf. below 8.2.6.3).
7.2.2.2.2.2V + ka # a'-hhu-: clauses of prohibitionHua manages to exist without any single verb or verbal aux­
iliary signifying possibility or permission, necessity or obliga­
tion. (The extent to which this is a real lack is attested by
the frequency with which speakers resort to the Pidgin borrowing
inapmihu'can, be able' from Pidgin inap 'can'.) A number of peri­
phrastic constructions will actually cover most of the semantic
territory occupied by these auxiliaries in English, and the pre­
sent construction is one of them. It is used to render sentences
like ""X is not allowed to do Y"", and is comparatively rare.

afane
'You can't go up!'
havi - Ka

Where the form occurs in texts it is in all but one case
found directly before an imperative clause, and thus occurs with
the pre-imperative clause-final morpheme -Ke.
There seems to be
no necessity for this, but the collocation prohibitive + impera-174MORPHOLOGYtive seems to be frequent enough to justify being mentioned in
the grammar:

If the /a/ of afu- is truly the negative prefix, as indicated, it
is noteworthy that it cannot be omitted in this construction.
Sentences like *hauga hane 'you can go up' (?) are impossible.
7.2.2.2.3V + di': the infinitiveThe invariable desinence -di'
has two primary functions: the
first is to create infinitives, which are nominal, the second is
to create relative clauses, which are adjectival. Relative
clauses in -di ', like relative clauses in ma'3, may occur with a
variety of case affixes, and thus act as nominal expressions, but
the former may occur in the vocative case as well, while the lat­
ter may not.
The -di'
desinence, like -Ka, cannot cooccur with any future
auxiliary - compare the English infinitival complementizer to
which is also mutually exclusive with any modal auxiliary.
The nominal use of the infinitive calls for little comment
at this time: vo- 'sleep' vo + di'
'to sleep'.
The infinitive may also occur as a relative clause (but not
as a complement) on any head noun phrase, and differs from the
relative in -maj chiefly in its failure to indicate a number of175VERB COMPLEXESdistinctions of person, tense, and aspect which are possible for
the relative. Thus, while the relative allows one to distinguish
seven persons, the infinitive, like forms, in -Ka, allows one to
distinguish only two:
hu + di'
na
!
the thing which I, you, he/she, we two, we all did'
hi + di' na
'the thing which we two/ they two, you all/they did1
Since -di' may not occur with the future auxiliary, no distinction
of tense is possible: the result is not ambiguity, however, as
the tense reference of an infinitival relative clause is, rather
surprisingly, invariably noji-future.
Finally, -di' may not occur with either the perfective aux­
iliary ro- or with the compound habitual auxiliary ro+hu, and
here the result is a multiple ambiguity: hu+di'
na can mean not
only 'the thing which he did', but also the 'thing which he has
done', or 'habitually does'.
An obvious use for the infinitival relative is to mark rela­
tive clauses where the nature of the subject and specific details
of the time of action are of no interest: compare do+ma' na 'that
which I ate' and do + di' na 'that which is eaten', where the lat­
ter is the term for food.
Although both -di' and -ma'3 relatives may occur on any head
NP, only the former may occur as epithets without this head NP in
the nominative and vocative cases. Thus both (a) and (b) below
mean ""man with his anus stuck out"":

(or rather, per­
haps, a suffix -'a) as already noted, creates corresponding future
tense nouns: ega 'yesterday' ega + 'a 'tomorrow'. Possibly this
suffix is a mere homonym of the nominalizer, which, however, has
sufficiently diverse functions that it should be allowed to have
this one as well.
That the basic function of the suffix is to act as a nomi­
nalizer is obvious from the fact that it acts as a complementizer
on certain subordinate clauses: indirect questions.
All indirect questions, whether or not they are polar, occur
with the interrogative desinence -ve^. This desinence may
option­
ally be followed by the suffix -'a, whereupon the entire comple­
ment clause becomes a nominalization capable of occurring with the
potential topic suffix -mo:DERIVATIONAL MORPHOLOGY299Aigatoga

topic suffix -mo, they are syntactically nominalizations, ex­
pressing a variety of subordinate clauses of time, place, and
reason.
Such relative clauses may be followed by one of the nominal­
izing suffixes -na, -bo',
or -'a,
in which case they cease to be
bivalent: they may function only as nominalizations, irrespective
of whether they occur with a case suffix or the potential topic
suffix -mo.
Thus, we find clauses of the following three types:

ond and third persons in the. dual and plural: no third person
dual and plural pronoun in the ergative exists, while the ergative
suffix for the third person on common nouns is distinct for dual
and plural numbers.
It may at first appear that the agreeing ergative is in both
form and meaning a compound of the ergative suffix (mu' 'sg.1, mi
'pi.') and the pronominal appositions of section 8.2.4. For a
number of reasons, however, this analysis cannot be maintained.
First, although both personal pronouns and common nouns oc-230MORPHOLOGYcur with the agreeing ergative suffix, neither occurs with the
pronominal apposition suffix.
Second, from an examination of proper nouns, it is clear
that the pronominal appositions precede
case affixes (including
the ergative), while the agreement morpheme of the agreeing
ergative follows
the case affix. The two cooccur, but in differ­
ent slots.
However, since these two morphemes are mutually dependent
following proper nouns, it is easy to account for the formal
identity of the two, and for their cooccurrence, by positing a
copying rule:
pronoun apposition + ergative =>
1
21 2 1 (Obligatory)This hypothesis could not account for the presence of ergative
agreement on common nouns and pronouns, where, as noted, pronoun
appositions do not occur, and the rule would have nothing to copy.
These considerations demonstrate the impossibility of iden­
tifying the second part of the agreeing ergative with the pronom­
inal apposition. Moreover, it is impossible to identify the
first part of the ergative with the ""regular"" mu' ~ mi suffix,
since the alternation is not as predicted: if the agreeing erga­
tive truly consisted of ergative + pronominal apposition, one
would expect to find the syllable mu ( ') throughout for the singu­
lar, and the syllable mi throughout for the plural. As it happens,
however, mu(')
is found not only in the singular, but in the first
person of the dual and plural as well.
Another analysis which avoids these problems, but encounters
others, is the following:
The ergative singular suffix (which Hua shares with other
languages of the area) is mu'.
Given the sporadic alternation
/'/ ~ nar mu' could be interpreted as an allomorph of a (nonoccurring) *muna.
But this suffix is now identical with a same
subject medial verb mu- in the 3sg. A complete paradigm for such
a verb, given the general ablaut rule, and the form of the antic­
ipatory desinences, would be
muda
muka
munasg.","[288, 289]"
"Apparently, the root is reinterpreted as *Kovo + o, and the pro­
nouns are infixed after Kovo-.
An alternative explanation, that
the pronouns have allomorphs no-, go-, o-, etc., and are inserted
between the root and the personal endings, is supported by the
form of these pronouns in the progressive: kovo + go + mino + oe
(/kovogominoe/) 'I am hitting you', but the vowel /o/ could have
been inserted to break up the consonant cluster */gm/ (cf. a sim­
ilar case of insertion on page

people
(not geographical place names) invariably ends in - V' $#. This
is particularly noteworthy inasmuch as Hua has a large number of
proper names like English Daisy,
which are also common nouns.
Whereas the common noun in Hua may end in either -V$# or -V'$#,
the corresponding proper name invariably ends in -V'$#. The fi­
nal /'/ of proper names may thus be taken as a distinguishing
mark:

[ + segment] [+segment] o [ + syll.] [glottal stop] /$ #All stems and suffixes are subject to SSC. 1: so too, con­
veniently, are prefixes. If they are syllabic, they invariably
end in a vowel, or a vowel + glottal stop sequence. Thus ha#,
u' 'already', 'a'(a)
'negative', and the dual personal pronoun
prefixes ra'(a)
'we two' and pa1(a)
'you two, they two'. Nonsyllabic prefixes like d 'I', since they do not end syllables,
are naturally not subject to SSC (1).
Further subclassification of stems is impossible: common
nouns, adjectives, and adverbs are subject only to SSC. (1). Subclassification of suffixes, while possible, may not be very sig­
nificant. It is possible to note, for example that possessive
suffixes, anticipatory desinences, and plural case affixes end in
-V$#, while singular case affixes end in -V'$#, but it is doubtful
that subclassifications of this sort are much more general than
morpheme-by-morpheme descriptions.
There is, however, one distinction which is of potentially
greater significance. The final syllables of complete
utterances
invariably end in -V$#. Either verbs or nouns (in the vocative)
may act as complete utterances. Verb stems (=imperatives) invar­
iably end in one of the vowels /i,o,u/; verbal desinences which
form principle clauses suchas the indicative e , interrogative.
ve , and the concessive va always end in a vowel. Verbal end­
ings marking non-final of subordinate clauses, such as ga^ (me­
dial) , or di' (the infinitive), may end with either the glottal
stop or a vowel. Nouns in the vocative, including proper names,
lose their final glottal stop, fitome'
becoming [fitome (ho)],SUPRASEGMENTALS85and so on.
Since the vowel-final pattern is the result, at least in this
latter case, of a deletion process, the constraint on utterancefinal syllables applies not at the level of underlying, but of
superficial structure. It suggests, however, a possible morpho­
logical analysis of /'/ : marking proper nouns, possible on nouns,
impossible on verb stems, impossible on vocatives, this segment
/'/ marks the constituent which it ends as no more than part of a
sentence, never a full utterance in itself. Later on, we shall
see that it functions as a nominalizer.
4.2.1.1.1 Syllable codas on borrowed words
The foreign sounds /B,D,G/ exist only at syllable boundaries,
where they are syllabified as m$b, n$d, and n$g. Their existence
is entirely responsible for the creation of syllable codas in -VN
in underlying structure.
Glottal stops and nasals are thus the only consonants which
may occur in syllable-final position in Hua. Behaviour of this
sort, common to the glottal stop and (in particular) the unmarked
nasal /n/ will be encountered repeatedly, until it can no longer
be dismissed as fortuitous.
It is worth anticipating to point out that there is no dis­
parity between underlying and superficial structure with respect
to syllable codas. While there are a number of rules which elim­
inate syllable-final /""// a n ¿ other rules which create syllablefinal /'/ and nasals, the repertoire of superficial syllable co­
das is the same as the repertoire of underlying syllable codas:
-V$, -V'$, and -VN$.
4.2.1.2Constraints on syllable onsetsThe greatest variety of syllable onsets is found at the be­
ginning of syntactic words: complexes consisting of prefix + stem
+ suffix. Word-internal syllable onsets, however, do not seem to
be limited in any systematic way. The following statements, then,
while applicable to word-initial syllable onsets, will also apply
to word-internal syllables unless otherwise specified.
4.2.1.2.1Single segmentsThe foreign phonemes /B,D,G/ will never occur at syllable on­
sets.
Of the native phonemes, the glottal stop is suspicious.","[142, 143, 144]"
"210MORPHOLOGYIn the preceding paragraphs, infixation and absorption have
been described from a historical point of view, as our concern
was to provide an. explanation for the genesis of the object para­
digms on p. 204.
However, both infixation and absorption will
be treated as productive processes in a synchronic grammar of Hua:
the historically prior form *prefix
# ha ... will be treated as
the""underlying form, to which the ordered rules of absorption
and morpheme metathesis, described below, will apply in the order

Optional when 1 = ldl., obligatory otherwise.
The less important consideration favouring this analysis is
the fact that it makes it possible to derive the entire object
paradigm of /ha.../ words from one set of roots, rather than a
pair of suppletive alternants.
More significant is the fact that both processes are entire­
ly productive, and will apply to any root of the correct phonolo­
gical form irrespective of its meaning. A case in point is
haivuva
'root', an object which can be inalienably possessed only
by a tree. In Hua folklore, the personification of non-human
objects is possible, but not attested for trees. Yet informants
are confident that if trees could talk, they would refer to their
roots as handaivuva
'my roots 1 , hagaivuva
'your root', and so on.
7.3.4.4Other periphrastic constructionsA variety of more or less idiosyncratic constructions are
listed in this section: transitive verbs which do not occur with
pronoun prefixes. Were it not the fact that these verbs are some
of the most common in the language, they would be treated in the
lexicon rather than in the grammar itself.
7.3.4.4.1Suppletion of ebgi-'hit'The transitive verb ebgiis prohibited by the MSR from oc­
curring with objects other than 3sg.ø. With all other objects,
ebgiis replaced by hao- 'shoot', a verb which allows infixationVERB COMPLEXES211and absorption of the pronoun object. The object paradigms for
""hit"" and ""shoot"" are thus identical except in the 3sg.: hadae
means, either 'He hit me' or 'He shot me', and so on.
7.3.4.4.2The verb does not take pronoun objectsPronoun object prefixes are the result of agreement with a
pronoun object in the absolutive case. Of the common verbs hakoand hagaro'look for' furotoand hokuhu'find', and havi- 'hear',
and ri'take, hold, grab', all but the last are prohibited from
appearing with pronoun object prefixes for phonotactic reasons.
Pronoun object prefixes are avoided in one of three ways: the
verb takes an object in an oblique case; the verb never takes hu­
man objects; or the verb takes a support verb which may and does
occur with pronoun prefixes.
The two verbs hako- and hagaro'look for' take objects in
the benefactive case. Noun Phrases of the form NP + hi' are ex­
empt from agreement:Kgai si'hakoeyou (ben.) I looked for
'I looked for you.'
The verbs havi'hear' and ri'take, grab hold of', never
occur with human objects. Rather than say 'I heard you', a Hua
speaker will say 'I heard your talk'.
Rather than say ""He held
me', he will say 'He held my hand (leg, etc.)'. Consequently,
the object NP will always be 3sg., and the pronoun object, null.

Ke

The regular supporting verb for transitive verbs which cannot
allow object prefixes is ()to'leave, abandon': the main verb is
made into a same of subject coordinate medial, and the support
verb takes pronoun objects and all auxiliaries and personal de­
sinences. The verbs furotoand hokuhu'find' typically occur
with the support verb ()Ko- 'see1: here it is the support verb
which is made into a same-subject coordinate medial, and the main
verb which retains the auxiliaries and inflections of the origi­

"7.2.2.2Non-final desinencesVerbs may occur as complete utterances, but not all verbs do.
Non-final verbs are those which cannot stand as complete utter­
ances, elliptical or other. A number of such desinences are used
to mark subordinate clauses of purpose, conditionals, relative
clauses, gerunds, and infinitives. Medial verbs, which may be
marked by a second desinence are morphologically characterized as
a subclass of the group of dependent, or non-final verbs.
7.2.2.2.1The relative desinence-ma'3Relative clauses in Hua as in most SOV languages precede the
noun phrase which they modify. The verb in such a clause occurs
with the relative desinence -ma'3-, and the noun phrase within
the relative clause that is identical with the head is obligatori­
ly deleted after verbal agreement has applied:fu
pig eat 1 ass.A
pig
'The pig which I ate'eat 1rel.ApigRelative complements are formally identical with complement170MORPHOLOGYclauses which contain no noun phrases coreferential with the head,
and in the derivation of which no deletion is involved:
Ke
'The story that they fought.'
In future relative clauses, as in future interrogatives, the mor­
phological distinction between indicative and subjunctive auxil­
iaries is neutralized in favour of the subjunctive -su-:
hi-su - ma'Ke'the word(s) which I
(*hu - Ku - ma'speak'Ke'the word(s) which I will speak'.)
The prohibition on the cooccurrence of the future indicative aux­
iliary Ku and the relative desinence ma'3 is not absolutely gen­
eral. There are two constructions where it is regularly violated,
neither of them relative clauses.
7.2.2.2.1.1 Concessive clauses
Concessive clauses, which may be translated into English as
""S, but,..."" have the desinence -ma'3, followed by either borava
ornamava:
hu - e'I did it.'
hu -ma'borava'I did it but,...'
In this construction, both indicative and subjunctive future aux­
iliaries may occur, with different meanings; the post-desinential
particle namava is confined to subjunctive forms:
hu - Ku - ma'borava'I will do it but,...'
hi- su - ma'namava'I would do it but,...'
A noteworthy feature of concessive clauses, which clearly estab­
lishes that they are not relative clauses, is that they may stand
alone (and be optionally followed by the utterance completionVERB COMPLEXES171marker -o). A following clause is expected, but may be only in­
ferred. Further analysis of the particles borava and namava is
impossible, but it is likely that the final syllable /va/ in each
is identical with the concessive-expectant desinence va^. The
constant meaning of this desinence is a signalling that the fol­
lowing clause will be a balancing or contrasting assertion.
7.2.2.2.1.2""In case..."" clauses""In case..."" clauses have the desinence -ma'3, followed by
the particle nagisi'.
Either future or perfective auxiliaries
may occur in such clauses: what is essential is that at least one
do so. The choice of future or indicative or subjunctive auxilia­
ries is free, as in the avolitional mood. Consequently, any of
the following is a grammatical translation of ""In case he does
it ..."" :
hu
- Ki - ma' nagisi'
hi
si
- ma' nagisi'
- re - ma' nagisi'
hu
hu - ro - Ki - ma' nagisi'
hu - re - si - ma' nagisi'(future indicative)
(future subjunctive)
(perfective)
(future indicative + perfective)
(future subjunctive + perfective)The particle nagisi'
may be further analyzed as a nominal, from
the fact that it may occur as the complement of the inanimate cop­
ula verb ne (cf. below 15.1).
7.2.2.2.2The participle in -KaThe invariable desinence -Ka (phonetically always /ga/) fol­
lows the verb stem or the progressive form of the verb. It can
not cooccur with any future auxiliary. It occurs in two construc­
tions, of which one seems to be adjectival, the other, nominal.
7.2.2.2.2.1V + K a # Ktafu-: clauses of similarityThe verb Ktafu(from Kta' + hu: Kta' is probably a doublet
of Kota 'face, nose') means 'to be like' - compare English
like
from M.E. lik 'face'.
It is a transitive verb, and the expression ""X is like Y""
would be rendered with X as the subject, and Y as the object of
Ktafu-.
More common in Hua, however, are sentences like
X is like Y is.
X dances like Y
dances.
X sings like a frog croaks.","[228, 229, 230]"

Possibly -opa(o)
derives from 'a' (negative) + va(o) (con­
cessive expectant desinence) . Like most clauses in -va3, negative
predicates are followed by a balancing positive statement. (Com­
pare German nicht...
sondern.)
8.2.8.3The symmetrical conjunctionsNoun phrases in the same case may be symmetrically conjoined
by either -ve ""non-exhaustive and"" or -Ki ""exhaustive and"". Of
these, the first is identical with, and semantically related to,
both the topic marker and the interrogative marker, while the sec­
ond is more clearly related to the collective suffix Ki, and pos­
sibly to the comitative suffix -Ki'.
Like the topic and predicate markers, with which they are
mutually exclusive, the symmetrical conjunctions must be preceded
by either the citation suffix or the potential topic suffix on
each noun phrase to which they are affixed.
nutimupe
The unique exception occurs in the idiom aunimupe
hie 'He snivelled and snotted', the morpheme-by-morpheme transla­
tion of which is, presumably:

tears
(erg.)
and/or
hi
- e
do 3
(fin.A)ø
- nuti - mu'
his snot
(erg.)ve
and/orThis construction, if correctly interpreted, is doubly anomalous,
in that the conjunction -ve not only occurs directly after a case250MORPHOLOGYaffix without intervening enlargement, but in that this conjunc­
tion occurs with a case, the ergative, with which it does not
elsewhere cooccur.
Nouns conjoined by either -ve or -Ki must both be in the same
case: the only exception to this general rule is that -ro'
and
-vi' are counted as the same. It is thus possible to conjoin
adessive/allatives with inessive/illatives, and ablatives with
elatives. In spite of their phonetic identity, however, it should
be noted, adessives may not be conjoined with allatives, nor
inessives with illatives. That is, it is possible to say ""at the
house and in the garden"" (adessive and inessive) ""from the house
and out of the garden"" (ablative and elative), but not ""at the
house and into the garden"" (adessive and illative), or ""at the
house and to the garden"" (adessive and allative).
In a number of contexts, the two conjunctions are inter­
changeable , yet they are not synonymous. Ki marks exhaustive
listing: A+Ki B+Ki may best be translated as ""both A and B"". Ve,
on the other hand, marks an open-ended, or non-exhaustive list:
A+ve B+ve usually means ""A and B and..."". Another important dis­
tinction between the two is that while -Ki is invariably a con­
junction, -ve is actually an inclusive disjunction like Latin vel,
or legalese and/or.
Accordingly, the string A+ve B+ve has a sec­
ond reading ""A or B or..."".
There is evidence of a typological nature that suggests that
the correlation between non-exhaustive listing and inclusive dis­
junction is not fortuitous. In English, for example, the same
lexeme or has both inclusive and exclusive readings:
1.
2.","[307, 308, 309]"
"All of them may be followed, like nominal expressions, with
the restrictive quantifier -Ko',
which has much the same meaning
as the possessive pronoun suffix:
dgai+ 'di+ Ko''just me, myself, only me 1kai+ 'a+ Ko''just he, he himself,'Compare the medial verbs:
hu
+ 'da + di + Ko'
'I just did it and I...'
baito
+ 'Ka + 'Ka + Ko'
'just if you are, you...'
Finally, all medial verbs, like nouns, may be followed by at
least one case affix, the benefactive -hi'.
More accurately, they
may be followed by an apparently optional and meaningless sylla­
ble /hi 1 /, whose identity with the homophonous case affix remains
to be proven.
For all its seeming lack of meaning, the post-medial suffix
/hi 1 / is subject to a distributional constraint from which its
meaning may be inferred. This meaning, in turn, is related close­
ly enough to that of the benefactive case that the two morphemes
may be judged to be identical.
It is a characteristic common meaning of all medial clauses
that they imply a causal relationship between themselves and the
following clause. Thus, in most cases, a medial clause may be
translated as ""S and so...""
rather than simply as ""S and..."":SYNTACTIC DEFINITIONS OF THE PARTS OF SPEECH283Mu

way, Hua is behaving in a fashion similar to that of many European
languages: in Russian and Huangarian, the copula verb (at least in
the present indicative) may be deleted, but the homophonous exis­
tential verb may not; in Classical Greek, the existential verb is
stressed as a verb, while the homophonous copula verb (as in
Hungarian and Russian, deletable) is an unstressed clitic. In one
way or another, the existential verb has a prominence which the
copula verb does not.
The question remains whether in sentences (10) - (13), the
pairs of sentences are related by copula insertion

tences are basic, the (a) sentences derived), or by copula
dele­
tion

Surface structureThe deep structure of the one derivation is equivalent to the
surface structure of the other.
Both derivations pose an embarrassing problem for the puta­
tive distribution of the potential topic suffix -mo which is un­
questionably present in (10b) - (13b). By the criterion which
seems to govern the distribution of this particle everywhere else,
noun phrases which act as complete sentences (or are capable of
acting as such) should not occur with -mo, and in these sentences,
they do.
It is somewhat more consistent with the theory of the distri­
bution of the particle to hold that the predicate complement za
is at no stage acting as a complete sentence. This view is best
maintained if we adopt the derivation in which the copula is
derivation in which the copula is present in deep structure.
However, there is considerable evidence that the relationship
between the (a) and (b) sentences in the ecamples above is not
describable in terms of either copula insertion or copula dele­
tion. The (b) sentences are examples of a more general phenomenon
of what I will call Sellipsis.","[404, 405]"

the principal clause.
The situation in Hua is somewhat different: for most of the
agreement processes considered in the preceding pages, coreference
asserted is as good as coreference presupposed. There is, however,
a natural difference between agreement in principal clauses and in
relative clauses which will dicate the extent to which the lan­
guage is indifferent to such distinctions.

may trigger various kinds of agreement rules before it is deleted,
and thus leave a trace of its presence even after it has been wip­
ed out.
The deleted NP may be the subject
of the relative clause, in
which case the verb will show subject agreement by T9:AGREEMENT PHENOMENA

of some other
noun in the relative clause, and this possessed noun will then be
marked for agreement with the deleted possessor by Tl (prefix386SYNTAXagreement) or T2 (suffix agreement):
Deep structureSurface structure'The woman whose son died'
In all of the examples above, as in relative clauses generally,
the only deleted element in the clause is the NP which is coreferential with the head NP. The head NP, in other words, is the only
missing
element in the relative clause with which nouns and verbs
may agree.

The case endings are very closely parallel to those of Hua.
For convenience, they are compared with their Hua congeners in the
table below (all forms occur in both a post-vocalic and a postglottal form, the form shown below being the former):

roots which are ambiguous as to number. On pluralia tantum nouns
such as gi 'people1, only -su may occur: vana+ mosu 'man's'; vana +
misu 'men's'; gi + su 'people's'. (Note that gi is cognate with the
identical form in Hua, acting as the collective suffix.)
The allative ra(i) ~ (ta(i)) can be made into an adjective by
the addition of the suffix -isa:
kama' + ra 'here'; kama' + ra + isa
vana 'a man from here'.
An allomorph of the ergative singular -mamo occurs on proper
names, kin terms, and the interrogative pronoun kega 'who': vana +
mo 'man(erg.)'; Aza + mamo 'Aza(erg.)'; na + va + mamo 'my father
(erg.) ' .
The vocative -o as in Hua is confined to proper names and kin
terms. On proper nouns, the suffix -ve (post-glottal alternant
-re!)
occurs: Aza + o 'Aza!'; Kama' vana+ ve 'You man!'; Kama'

but do not seem to make any distinction between visibility and in­
visibility (it must be admitted that this last may be very marginal
in Hua also): kara' and ke' both correspond to Hua na 'that'; kama'
to Hua ma 'this'; kerne' to Hua bura, bira 'there, yonder'; komo'
to Hua mina muna 'down there'; avere' to Hua biga, buga 'up there';
and ara' to Hua a'ina 'this, same'. All may function as nouns in
the vocative: kerne' + re 'You over there!', and in the locative
cases: kerne' + raimi (ri)+ gateatarug(e)ove'I will stay over thereand come up.'.
Hua has two copula and existential verbs no- (inanimate) and
bai- (animate). Corresponding to these Gimi has hani- and miri-.
There exists a third, invariable root re- which.occurs only in neg­
ative statements of existence, in which context it is interchange­
able with hani-: one' ka + re = one' ka + hanie 'there is no water'.
In Hua, it seems that the copula verb stem may be omitted,
leaving the final or the interrogative desinence on the nominal
predicate. There are arguments in favour of this position, of
which the strongest is the identity of the post-nominal predicate
markers and ther verbal desinences. There are, however, also argu­
ments against it, most notably the fact that predicate markers
occur on Hua nouns which never could have acted as complements of
copula verbs. In Gimi, the arguments against a transformation of
copula deletion are stronger, inasmuch as the predicate indicative
and interrogative markers on nominal predicates are not even sim­
ilar to the verbal desinences as which they (by the deletion hy­
pothesis) originate. The indicative predicate marker is -ve (postglottal -re), but the interrogative marker, rather than *-vo, is
-ve also (post-glottally, -pe): Narepa+ ve? '(Is it) a casuarina?';
Narepa + ve '(It is) a casuarina.'; Nama' + vi' + ve? 'In the house?';
Nama' + vi' + ve 'In the house.' The last two, phonetically, are
/namapipe/and/namapire/.","[587, 588, 589]"
"On deicticsMost deictics can occur with a locative suffix to form ad­
verbs of place and direction. With all other case suffixes, they
must occur with the nominalizer -bo': ma + ro' 'here', but ma +
bo' + 0 'this (one)'.
There are, however, two deictics, on which the preferred
nominalizer is -'a. They are a'ina
'this, same', and aiga'
'which':

'much, many, plenty'. One of these quantifiers,

'all, every', cannot function as a free-standing noun without it:

+ 'a 'everyone'.

On all other quantifiers, the addition of 'a seems to result
in no change in meaning, but in the restriction of syntactic func­
tion to ""acting noun"":

Theoretically, intransitive verbs with ()tosupport should
have two possible syntactic sources:
(a) they are fundamentally middle or intransitive verbs which are
made transitive (=extroverted) or causative by ()tosupport,
as described in section 15.2.2.
(b) they are intransitive verbs with benefactive complements (as
described in this section.)
In practice, if a sentence may have (a) as its syntactic source,
it will never be interpreted in such a way as to have (b).
In the present language, ()tojust misses being a general
causative verb: transitive verbs with benefactive complements on
a support verb ()tocannot be interpreted as causativized forms
of the transitive verb. For example doda ktoe can mean 'I ate it
for you', but not 'I made you eat.'
Finally, the benefactive object must be distinct from the
subject. In English, we may say 'I built myself
a house.', but
this is impossible with ()tosupport in benefactive constructions
as in others:*Zu' kidadtoe'I built my self a house.'
Only the full form of the pronoun in the benefactive case may
occur:Dgaisi'zu'kue'I built a house for myself.'",[413]
"It would seem that the major problem in identifying condition­
al clauses with inconsequentials, however, must be semantic: the
traditional view of the meaning of conditionals, as echoed in a
number of modern writers (cf. Strawson 1952: 37; Ramsey 1935: 247)
is that they assert some kind of cause-consequent relationship
between themselves and the following clause. This view, if cor­
rect, would flatly contradict any identification of conditionals
with inconsequential clauses, which specifically deny a cause consequent relationship between themselves and the following
clause.
On this point, the traditional view is probably mistaken.
The mere fact that in most languages the morphology of ""even if..""
clauses is identical, or nearly so, with ""if..."" clauses should
be sufficient to refute the idea that the basic meaning of condi­
tionals is to mark a cause-consequent relationship. The true
meaning of conditionals is more likely that which is suggested by
their superficial form, not only in Hua, but in many other lan­
guages as well: since conditionals and topics are marked in simi­
lar ways, it is probable that they are semantically related as
well.
Evidence in favour of this contention will of course be of­
fered when the syntax of conditionals and other clause types is
considered in detail. For the time being, there is no insupera­
ble obstacle to regarding conditionals and inconsequential
clauses as related.
13.4.1.2AssertionsIt would seem that a major function of nominalized relative
clauses in the nominative case is to act as stylistic variants of
simple verb stems.
We begin the discussion of this function by examining a form
which shall be called the Emphatic
Habitual.
The E.H. for any
verb is formed by adding -ma' 3 + na ne+ to the verb stem. This
enlargement may in turn be followed by the personal desinences
-e3 (final) or - v e 3 (interrogative). Since the root ne is invaria­
bly 3sg., there is no allomorphy of the verbal desinences.",[364]
"The interrogative relative clauses in (232b) and (233b) correspond
to interrogative adjectives like ""what kind of"" or ""which"" in
English. Unlike such adjectives (which also exist in Hua) they are
not removed from the sentence in which they arise by any movement
transformation, nor does the matrix sentence acquire any of the461DISCOURSEmorphological characteristics (e.g. - v e 3 desinence) of an interrog­
ative sentence.
No other final clause mood is possible in a relative clause.
20.1.2Constraints on the relativizability of noun phrases in
simple sentencesThere are relatively few constraints on which noun phrase may
be relativized to act as the head of a relative clause. It may
originate as the subject, object, benefactive, genitive, locative,
or adverb in such a clause.

kuna
(adverb)
'the time when it rains; the rainy season '(subject)The following are the constraints on relativizability of noun
phrases: (a) when a noun phrase occurs in the benef active case as the
complement of a transitive verb which happens to take benefactive
government, it may be deleted under identity of reference with the
head of the relative clause. However, where a noun phrase occurs
in the benefactive case because it is a beneficiary, it cannot be
deleted. Hence the contrast between (235) and (236):
235236a)Ma gnuhi'
hadaie
'I like this person.'b)[Hadaima']
knumo
'a person that I like 'a)Ma dehi'
zubo kue
'I built a house for this person.'b) *[zubo kuma']
de
'a man I built a house for '462SYNTAXThe difference may be that the beneficiary may be incorporated into
the verb (cf, 234d) and relativizability is not allowed if the
option of incorporation, which leaves a trace of the deleted noun
phrase in surface structure, is not exploited.
(b) While a possessor noun phrase m a y be deleted, a possessed noun
phrase m a y not b e :237a)Vaza'

(c) No noun phrase m a y be relativized from a phrasal coordination.
This is equivalent to part of Ross'

'The man and the woman fought.'b) *[viagi 0 finamo ha'ma'] ara

Inherently reciprocal predicates like fina hu- allow conjunct
movement, in consequence of which verb agreement may be with either
the conjunction of NP which act as the deep structure subject, or
the single NP which acts the surface structure subject. The single
unmoved NP may then be relativized. Thus (239a) may be made into
(240a), which may then be relativized as (240b):240hie
