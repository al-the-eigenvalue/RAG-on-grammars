"(8)’, although in many cases there is no appropriate English equivalent.",[95]
"6.1.2 Quantifiers as Pronouns123[Boas 17.106]Quantifiers can also stand alone in the sentence, without any noun to modify. In these cases,the quantifiers themselves act a type of quantificational pronoun, e.g.sai/saiyu‘all of them’hats'u‘some of them’n'auya‘many of them’Another possible analysis is that they act of modifiers of the pronominal arguments marked
on the verb. Examples of this type are shown in (6)(6a)(6b)Sh'eesaini cha'aat'a.thenalldownthey PL sat INDThen they all sat down.","[137, 138]"
"Thirdly, many of the derivational and inflectional processes in the language involve some
type of change in accentual patterns. Syllable-final /‘/is affected by these processes, in some
cases being added, in other cases being deleted, as seen in the examples below.",[62]
"[Boas 30:463]as a discontinuousnounphrase,with duwaactingas ademonstrative adjective and dyeiyanyi as the head of the NP, much as is the case in the
English translation Boas provides.",[132]
"4.1.1 Uses as an InterrogativeAs an interrogative, dzii means ‘what? ’. It can be used in cases where the possible answers
are open-ended, as in (1).(la)Daiiduwa?whatthisWhat is this?(1b)Emidziikidru'uts'ipi?that's it| whatyou DL want it DIRIndeed, what do you (dl) want?(lc)Dziianyiugu?whatshe likes it DIR[Boas 06.063]76What does she like? (Boas 25.050]It is also used in cases where the range of possible answers is more limited, and where
English might use ‘which?’(2a)instead of ‘what?’, as in (2).","[90, 91]"
"In terms of word classes, Laguna has distinct noun and verb categories, although it also
has a fairly large number of roots which can serve as the basis for either nouns or verbs.
Nouns do not distinguish case or number, but they can be inflected for a possessor, with
distinct constructions for alienable and inalienable possession.",[24]
"If we look closely at the verbs in (14), we'll see that in all three cases it isJohn's role that isbeing marked in the PRMP prefix. In the first two sentences he is the actor, and the verb
carries a third person actor prefix.",[175]
"Despite any of these transcriptional shortcomings, in most cases once the Laguna
sentence had been matched up with its corresponding English sentence, it became
relatively easy to fill in the missing pieces of Boas's transcription at least enough to makeit intelligible to modern day speakers.","[23, 24]"
"In most cases, it is the first form, with the actor prefix, that gets used: this is the ""normal""
way of expressing an action involving a third person actor and a third person undergoer. The
second form, with the undergoer prefix, only gets used in cases where there is a “switch"" in
the action.",[173]
"For example:(39a)s'aapakéawany'i‘my axe’(39b)kidrayape‘you (pl) ate’(39c)dyaamihanutsida‘Tam Eagle clan’(39d)dziwaéhimatyishe‘those who believe, the believers’(39e)dzitmishchitsita‘he/she is fainting’However, there are a number of problematic cases which do not seem to fit this general
pattern. I discuss each of these below.",[48]

add a degree of uncertainty to astatement. In such cases, dzii may translate as ‘perhaps, if80efc..","[94, 95]"
"[Boas 19.136-138]In other cases, such as (10), there is no English translation.(10a)Maamedziik'adyaatyishch'uyuuna,very(what)he has a pet DIRmosquitodaukuna,

"162Laguna marks two roles morphologically: actor and undergoer The actor corresponds to the
subject in all cases except with impersonal verbs where it is simply adummy argument. The
undergoer corresponds to the subject with intransitive verbs, to the object with transitive
verbs, and to the recipient with ditransitive verbs.","[176, 177]"
"For example, consider the case of the noun hadraminyi ‘prayer sticks’, in Text 11 Origin
of the Hunting Customs, as told by Guudye. The noun first occurs in sentence 11.014 as the
Direct object.",[319]
"The basic rule, as formulated by Valiquette, doesaccount for the vast majority of cases of devoiced vowels in the language. However, as seen38above, it still leaves a notable minority of cases where vowels devoice unexpectedly, or
unexpectedly fail to devoice. Given these facts, we have to take voiceless vowels as being
phonemic in Laguna.","[52, 53]"
"{Boas 25.083]In some cases it can also translate as ‘why?’(12)“Guwa dza?""dyanaat'ahowhe said IND ChiefnoHuuchanyi.",[98]
"An exception to this pattern is found, however, in the case of reduplication.",[49]
"ForValiquette, there is only one set of prefixes, each with an essentially invariant meaning, used
in all cases.",[168]
"(4)iyadra-dza'a-nye
child-38G:ACT:DIR:‘when he was a child’
COPAUX-WHENWhile the simple copula is most often found with nouns, it can also be used with adjectives,
as in (5).(5a)dawaa-dza‘it is good’(5b)dawaa-nidaa-gu‘it will be good’(5c)naatsi-dza‘it is new’(5d)naatsi-nidaa-gu‘it will be new’(Se)hanaami-sidaTam naked’(5f)tsaya-sida‘Iam first’242Within a noun phrase, the adjective can come either before or after the noun. In either case,the simple copula will cliticize onto the final element in the phrase, pace Valiquette
(1990:96) who claims that the copula will always cliticize to the noun and not the modifier.
Compare the examples in (6).(6a)ubewidawaa-dzafoodgood-38G.ACT.DIR.SIMCOP‘it is good food; the food is good’(6b)dawaaubewi-dzagoodfood-3SG.ACT.DIR.SIMCOP‘it is good food; the food is good’Textual examples of this variation are shown in (7).","[256, 257]"
"4.8.1 Uses as an InterrogativeAs an interrogative, hauwi (or just hau) means ‘who?’. This can be used as an utterance
unto itself, in which case it is frequently interpreted as ‘Who are you?’ [Boas 16.0960,19.119].",[111]
"However, since duwa also acts as a demonstrativepronoun in many cases, the simpler analysis for this sentence is that duwa is itself the direct
object, and that dyeiyanyi is an appositive added after the verb as a reconfirming118elaboration of the demonstrative pronoun. As such, amore literal translation of this sentence
might be: ""7 brought these back, the pifion nuts.""","[132, 133]"
"It is for this reason that Laguna cannot be analyzed as having a fourth person or an obviative,
as Miller and Valiquette have done. In true obviative systems, such as those in Algonquian
languages, the distinction between the third and fourth person is maintained across both
(di)transitive and intransitive clauses, which is not the case in Laguna.",[176]
"In many cases, theresulting meaning is ‘never’, as in (26).(26a)Diisiy'aanyidzaadzihamadziianyeeright hereinfrontnotwhensomethingnicenupesrunu.
you will eat it NEGDIRFrom now on you will never eat anything nice.",[108]
"In this case,possession is expressed indirectly by means of an appositional construction involving the
nominalized verb stem -adyaashe ""someone's pet"" along with the name of the animal that
is being possessed. So, for example, to say “his horse"" -- or, more acturately ""his pet horse”
-- one says:(15) kawaayu= ik'adyaashekawaayu__—ik-adyaa-she
horse3/3:DIR-have.as.pet-NMNLZ‘his (pet) horse’lit. “horse, the one he has as a pet""In the example above, the Natural noun occurs first, and then the possessed form of the noun
for “pet"".",[76]
"In preparing this dissertation, then, I have used a combination of elicited data from
modern speakers, and textual data from Boas's corpus from the 1920's. Wherever
possible in this dissertation, I have used examples drawn straight from Boas's corpus to
illustrate a point. These examples have been rechecked with current speakers as to their
meanings, though not all of them were fully retranscribed, so there may be some
remaining transcriptional errors carried over from the original texts. In other cases, I
have used data from my own field sessions, or, where needed, forms from Valiquette
and/or Miller's work.",[24]
"2.2.2.2.2.3 Lexical ExceptionsBeyond these two cases discussed above, both of which could arguably be handled in one
way or another by appealing to the morphological status of the words involved, there are
quite a few other words where the devoicing and aspiration rules simply fail to apply, for no
clear reason.(45a)For example:srbiga(not: *srbika)‘woodpecker’(45b) édze(not: *étse‘and’(45c)gutidyi(not: *gutityi)‘give it fo me’(45d)sewinusrka(not: *sewinusrka)‘my heart’(45e)srk'uipe(not: *srk'uipe)‘my ear’Valiquette (1990:28) noted that most of the exceptional words are not verbs, but are instead
names (e.g.‘woodpecker’), body parts or function morphemes37such as conjunctions.",[51]
"For Miller, at least, all number marking is inflectional, and as such is outside thetheme. Valiquette is less commital on the topic, but still in the end excludes number from
the theme, except in cases of themes which are suppletive for number.",[203]
"Based on these data, we can develop a hypothesis about the relationship between a noun's
activation status (CITE) and morphosyntactic status. When a noun is mentioned for the first
time, it will tend to occur in pre-verbal position, signalling its maximally unactivated status;
this is the case in examples (13) and (14). A noun which has been mentioned recently in thediscourse, and therefore is somewhat activated, will tend to occur in a post-verbal position,
as in examples (15), (17), (18) and (20).",[323]
"4. With few exceptions, the forms they attach to are bound and do not occur independently
of these endings, which is parallel to the case of regular verb themes which do not occur238independently of their inflectional affixes.","[252, 253]"
"Thus, the si- prefix on siukacha J saw him/her/it’ marks a firstperson subject and a third person object (or, using his terms, a first person argument 1, and
a third person argument 2), while the si- prefix on siudraach'a ‘J fell off’, also marks a
first person subject and a third person object. The only difference between the two is that
in the latter case the object argument is a dummy.",[167]
"237While Miller and Valiquette analyze these forms as still being auxiliary verbs, I choose to
treat these simply as suffixes for the following reasons:1. They do not have the canonical -VCV(CV)- shape of the verb stem/theme found with
other (prefixing) verbs. In many cases, the verb theme appears to be simply -a- -- that is,
just a stem vowel, and no more stem after it.","[251, 252]"
"Secondly, tone distinctions are lost. All syllables with a final // are apparently low tone.
Again, this is not the case with syllables before a // which is in the onset of the following
syllable.",[62]
"However, it is not the case that ""make"" never marks the number of its direct object.
Consider the examples in (16).(16a)Sh'eesru.ch-uwawiidra-nahadraminyi.then3ACT:IND-PL:make.sth-PLprayer stickThen they made prayer sticks. [Boas 11.019](16b)Sh'eeseiyuch-uwawiidra-na.thenall3ACT:IND-PL: make. sth-PLThen they finished all of them.",[220]
"Compare thefollowing forms:(42a)ésuse‘I sneezed (once)’(42b)ésu'ésuse‘T sneezed alot’(42c)ésu'ésusidye‘we sneezed’In these cases, note that the second syllable /su/ is fully devoiced to /su/, even when the
next syllable has a -'- in the onset.",[49]
"Often the predicate in such a question is just a noun or pronoun, either singular or plural,
with no verb.",[111]
"[Boas 13.041-042]If the main verb of the sentence is transitive and hauwi is acting as the subject with another
third person human as the direct object, the verb will typically carry the appropriate form of
the third person patient pronominal prefix, since in this case the direct object will usually be
more topical than the unknown and unspecified subject (see Chapter 7).",[115]
"9.3.1 Simple Transitive ThemesSimple transitive themes have the following properties:* They haveno Voice prefix or Benefactive suffix. Their singular forms have no number
prefix, either, so in that case the stem and the theme are identical.",[207]
"This phenomenon may be what is behind the following quote from Miller (1965:12):Acomais alenis language. This feature is characteristic in the speech of Acomas whether
speaking Acoma or English. The principal objection to my pronunciation of Acoma was
that I spoke with too much force.",[31]
"Some commonquantifiers include:sai, saiyu‘all’n'auya‘many, a lot’hats'u‘some’k'uimi‘a little’While this is primarily a semantic grouping, distributional evidence shows that all quantifiers
can be used either as modifiers or as pronouns.",[134]
"In some cases hewrote them with a superscript vowel; other times he simply noted aspiration on the
preceding consonant; while other times he made no record of them at all. Vowel length
and tone were also problematic areas.",[23]
"2.2.2.2.2.2 Diphthongs and DevoicingFor the most part, diphthongs are immune to the process of vowel devoicing. For example:(43)ganasrgai‘his/her head’In this case, the low tone diphthong /ai/ is preceded by a non-glottalized obstruent /g/, and
is followed by a word boundary, and yet it remains fully voiced.",[50]
"In all four of these cases, the Direct mood is used because the speaker needs the listener to
accept the assertion that the information in the dependent clause is true, before they can
interpret the rest of the sentence. For instance, in (4), the listener needs to accept that it was,in fact, raining, before they can accept that the raining stopped. In (5), the listener needs to
accept that a rainy place does really exist before they can believe that Ted lives there.",[183]
"All vowels before a syllable-final /‘/ are short, or adiphthong. Note that this is not the case with vowels occurring before a /'/ which is in the
onset of the following syllable; in this environment, length distinctions are maintained, and
both long and short vowels are found.",[62]

[Boas 07.028]11.4 Possessive CopulaThe possessive copula (Valiquette's AUX #9) is used with nouns and noun phrases. It has
essentially the same meaning as the verb ‘get’ in English, in the sense of ‘come to possess’.
Like the locative copula, it does not cliticize to its complement.","[264, 265]"
"Note how in this case thereflexive prefix completely replaces the stem vowel.(6a)s'-ibuutsa‘I frightened him’1ACT:DIR-frighten.sb(6b)s-uu-buutsa‘I frightened myself”1ACT:DIR-RFLX-frighten.sbNote also how in both (5) and (6), the allomorph of the PRMP prefix changes between theSimple Transitive theme and its corresponding Reflexive theme.",[211]
"The three remaining voiceless vowels, /i/, /e/ and /#/, provide feweracoustic (or visual) cues as to their identity. In practice, the only way to be sure of the vowel
quality in such cases is to try to find a related word in which that vowel is not voiceless.
Compare:32(38a)(38b)_—its'‘ipe_‘ ts‘iubenyi‘he/she ate it’‘he/she has been eating (at) it’Note that voiceless syllables are indicated orthographically by underlining, as in (38a).","[46, 47]"
"6.2.3 Numbers[Boas 24.189]as NominalsNumbers can also be used as nominals, when there are no nouns in the sentence for them to
modify, or, alternatively, as modifiers of the pronominal arguments marked on the verb.
Examples are shown in (16).(16a)Sh'eesru.dyuuwedyuwaya.and thentwoshe gave birth to them (PL?) INDThen to two she gave birth.(16b)[Boas 23.061]Sh'ee chupehuusrumenye.",[148]
"[Boas 16.720-721]As an indefinite pronoun, dzaadzi hauwi can serve as an argument of the verb, as seenabove in (37). However, the same phrase can also serve as a modifier of an argument, with
the meaning ‘none ofus/you/them ’, as in (38). Note that the argument so modified is marked
as singular.(38a)“Dzaadzihauwiduweeisrgayasrunotsomeonethis wayontheothersidejustnyiyatisrunudi’hiyaanyi,""”dyanaat’a.you will travel NEGDIRhere___trailhe said IND""Nobody of you shall go along this trail,"" he said.",[119]

transitive and ditransitive verbs they also seem to code for a third person argument,
