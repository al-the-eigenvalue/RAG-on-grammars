"Thedifference between the manipulation of case and lexical compounding is thatthe former allows for an oblique argument to appear in the case position that
would normally be occupied by the incorporated noun.",[414]

the noun ‘bread’ is not an independent object.",[413]

While there are similarities between Type I and Type II noun incorporation,
Mithun (p.859) states that “Type II goes further than Type I [...] in having an
effect beyond the V itself. Instead of simply reducing the valence of the V by
one, it permits another argument of the clause to occupy the case role vacated by
the IN. The result is a lexical device for manipulating case relations within
clauses.”
Mithun’s Type III noun incorporation is referred to as the manipulation ofdiscourse structure and is “used to background known or incidental information
within portions of discourse”(p.859).","[414, 415]"
"Examples(79) and (80) illustrate fronted nouns, (81) a fronted noun marked for possession,
(82) an emphatic pronoun, (83) a personal noun, and (84) and (85) determiner
phrases.
Wh-questions are always in the form of some kind of fronting.",[116]
"This is also noted byAnderson (1992:82), who uses diminutive formation in Fula (Niger-Congo) andEnglish as a comparative example; the diminutive category is considered to be
inflectional in Fula, while in English diminutive forms are viewed as derivational.
Cases like this where one category can appear at different ends of a
spectrum depending on the language, involve more than just a distinction as to
where the operation actually takes place (i.e. the lexicon vs. syntax).",[66]
"This is not the case, however.",[342]
"She writes (1998:159),“[t]he morphosyntactic category as I am defining it includes morphemes that
reflect what are traditionally considered to be inflectional properties such as case,
number, gender, and aspect, but also includes morphemes that play some part in
determining or reflecting the syntactic frame or the argument structure of a Root.
In other words any entity that plays a role in the syntax is morphosyntactic,
whether that role is inflectional or functional”.",[43]
"405
A direct result of the MVC is that only pro can be generated in case-marked
positions, hence the fact that all polysynthetic languages show pro-drop for both
subject and direct object.","[417, 418]"
"This type ofnoun incorporation is like lexical compounding in that the incorporated noun is
not marked for definiteness, number or case. The noun is no longer a syntactic
argument in the clause, but instead qualifies the verb with which it combines.",[414]
"In each of the above examples the agent functions as the subject of the clause.
This is evidenced by the fact that it is the overt agent NP in (141) and (142) that is
in direct case, as opposed to the patient which is oblique.",[177]

"The first is the rootIf the phonological representationof the lexeme SWIM is nak’drm, how can the segments [k’ar] be isolated as a base
for morphological spelling operations, as appears to be the case with the
reduplicated form in (26)?
In cases like this, not just any segments can be isolated and targeted for
morphological spelling.",[55]
"92.6There is no overt morphological marker to indicate that the subject in (8) and (9)
is in fact 3rd person. This is determined by the absence of any overt agreement
for person and grammatical relation. Number, however, is overtly marked for 3rd
person pl. in the form of the clitic Ix, which almost consistently appears in second
position. This clitic never marks 1st or 2nd pl. as number is always co-represented
with person and grammatical function by a single morpheme in these cases.",[301]

"While the suffix -mis used to mark both antipassive and passive voice, note that unlike the passive,
antipassive voice is formed on intransitive stems only and never stems that have
been transitivized, as is the case with passive voice.",[177]
"Thus, while lexicalcompounding results in intransitive predicates, the manipulation of case results
in transitive predicates even though the incorporated noun does not serve as the
syntactic direct object.",[414]
"The fact that this is not the case further suggests that the structures ofincorporated noun clauses and bound stem clauses are quite different.

"With respect to the second property of Nxa?amxcin passives, the patient
argument is the only direct argument in the passive clause. There seems to be a
morphological split across the Salish family in that patient agreement for passives
in some languages is in the form of subject agreement (as is the case with
Nxaramxcin), while for others it is in the form of object agreement.",[170]

The “substantivals” of Selish and Wakashan, elements of substantival
significance but used only in combination with other stems or elements of
words and usually unrelated in form to the independent words of the same
significance, furnish apparent instances of incorporation, in that they are
sometimes used as objects of verb stems with which they are combined.
They are however also employed subjectively and adverbially, and are
therefore more than incorporated nouns. The essential nature and function
of these elements is still obscure, and until they become better understood
they also can furnish no proof of objective noun-incorporation.
A. Kroeber 1909:572-3
... it is clear that verbal affixes that refer to nouns, in other words, convey asubstantival idea, are not instances of noun incorporation if they are
etymologically unrelated to the independent nouns or noun stems with
which they seem logically connected. Such affixes are generally either
instrumental (Siouan, Shoshonean) or local (Kwakiutl, Salish) in character,
but may also be employed to represent the logical object or even, in the
case of intransitive verbs, subject (this use is characteristic of Kwakiutl,
Chemakum, and Salish). As long, however, as they are lexically distinct
from noun stems proper, they must be looked upon as grammatical
elements pure and simple, however concrete their signification may seem.
They are logically related to independent nouns of the same or allied
meaning as are tense affixes to independent adverbs of time.
Sapir 1911:251-2
The main reason lexical affixes have not fit neatly into any specific crosslinguistic category is due to their dual or ‘split’? behaviour.","[390, 391]"

"Only a subset of thesebound stems have emerged with a classifier usage, which seems to be the case for
other Salish languages as well. While numeral classifiers are homophonous with
their compound counterparts, they differ from the compound bound stems in
three important ways: (i) they combine primarily with numerals and quantifiers; (ii)
they can cooccur with a coreferenced direct noun; and (iii) their semantic
interpretations are much broader.
With respect to the first property, we see in examples (124) to (148) that
Nxaramxcin classifiers combine primarily with numerals (e.g. (124) and (141))
and quantifiers such as k’“inx ‘how many’ (e.g. (129) and (139)).",[388]

solely for number, and this only for the plural. Kinkade (1982b:49) points out
that the 1st and 2nd person clitics in (3) can be compared with the transitive
subject suffixes in the following section in that these clitics “consist basically of
k- plus the transitive subject suffixes except in the third person”.2
There is some variation as to the syntactic positioning of the 1st and 2nd

"(Number is markedseparately for third person, as shown below in example (59)). Anderson
(1992:76) remarks that “it seems to be the case that portmanteaux are much rarer

elements which combine inflectional and derivational categories in the same
portmanteau”.
(v) The Free Analog Test. As for the fifth and final criterion, Beard (1995)
points out that free morphemes, such as prepositions, postpositions, auxiliaries
and case markers, are assigned to specific structural positions in the syntax.
Because derivational operations take place before the level of syntax, we would
expect markers of derivational operations to never be realized as free morphemes.
Free morphemes must be restricted to inflection since it is only at the level of
inflection that structural positions are available for these morphemes.",[73]
