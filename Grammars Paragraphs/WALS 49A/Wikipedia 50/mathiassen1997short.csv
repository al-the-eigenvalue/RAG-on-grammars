"Note! the -Vm/(ies)-gerund cannot be replaced by the -oS-participle
(on which see below), but a subordinate ka-clause (that-clause) can beused instead:
Dzirdéju, ka Alma esot atbraukusi uz Stokholmu
I have heard that Alma has come to Stockholm
‘
b)-sot,refl.-sotiesThis gerund seems to be restricted to the relative mood, cf. example on p. 132.
c) -ot, refl. -oties
The function (so-called “absolute function”) of this gerund is toreplace adverbial clauses (see p. 211 ff.) if the grammatical subject of
the adverbial and the main clauses are not identical/not co-referential
(contrast with B below). The logical subject
struction (clause) is in the dative case, e.g.of the participlecon-Tuvojoties dienesta laikam, Grinis (vins) atgriezas Latvija
(quoted from A. Eiche 1983)
When the time for military service drew nearer, Grinis (he) returned to Latvia.
From a diachronic perspective, both the noun (or the pronoun) and the gerund
(which represents a petrified participle form) will have been in the dative case. Such a
construction, labeled “the absolute dative” or “double dative” construction, is found alsoin Lithuanian and has a parallel in Slavic. In other Indo European languages cases other
than the dative may be used to form gerundival clauses functionally equivalent to sub-THE VERB: NON-FINITE FORMS151ordinate clauses. Thus, in Latin the (double) ablative is used, in Greek the (double) genitive and in Sanskrit the (double) locative.","[147, 148]"
"2. Number
(Skaitlis)Latvian distinguishes between two grammatical numbers, singular
and plural. A peculiarity of Latvian — along with Lithuanian — is the
richness in plural nouns (so-called pluralia tantum, see p. 51 f. below).
3. Case
(Locijums)
Traditionally, grammars of Latvian have worked with a system of
seven cases: the nominative, the genitive, the dative, the instrumental, the
accusative, the locative and the vocative.
However, the status of the alleged instrumental (which is identicalin form with the accusative in the singular, the dative in the plural) in
modern Latvian can be questioned, since it occurs only with the
preposition ar with. As will be seen in the chapter on prepositions, all
prepositions in Latvian take the dative case in the plural. Thus, it seems
legitimate to assert that in modern Latvian there is no instrumental, and
that the preposition ar governs the accusative (as does, for example, par
about). However, departing from distributional criteria, it is problematic
to claim that a given preposition governs one case (variably the
accusative, genitive or dative) in the singular and another (invariably the
dative) in the plural. A solution to the dilemma would be to assume two
systems; i. e. one involving an accusative, genitive)» etc. for nonprepositional use, and another for prepositional use involving an accusative2, genitive2 etc., but this conclusion would pose an obstacle to
making simple generalizations. In this grammar we will agree with Fennell (1975, pp. 41-48 ), Létzsch (1978, pp. 667-671) and others, who
have denied the existence of a separate instrumental case in Latvian,
whence we arrive at a system consisting of six cases. For certain adverbialized residual traces of the Indo-European instrumental, see chapter
_ 8: Case.",[38]
"Thus, a sentence like the boy was helped should be rendered in Latvian
by zénam palidzéja and not *zéns tika palidzéts since the verb
palidzét to help requires the dative case and is consequently intransitive.
The unmarked (or neutral) word order of Latvian is probably
SVO. This order is obligatory in cases where the object cannot formally
be distinguished from the subject, e.g.: mates mil meitas mothers love
daughters.
Two ObjectsAs in the case of adverbial modifiers, there may be more than one
object in the sentence. A frequent case is that with an indirect (dative)ener,WORDORDER225object denoting a person + a direct accusative object referring to a thing,
e.g. meitene deva zénam gramatu the girl gave the boy a book. A
neutral reading of this sentence with no particular emphasis on any sentence member implies that the dative object is thematic, the accusative
object rhematic. This SVOjndOdir order will probably be the commonest(and consequently “neutral’”’) word order pattern for sentences containing
both a dative and an accusative object. If the order of the dative and the
accusative object is reversed, the latter will take over the thematic role
whereas the former will turn into a rhematic object: meitene deva
gramatu zénam the girl gave the book to a/the boy. In both cases the
objects both occur in postverbal position.
In the case of pronominalization the pronoun (be it the indirect or
direct object) will usually precede the noun object, e.g. meitene deva
vinam gramatu (or, may be, even more commonly: meitene vinam
deva gramatu), meitene deva to zénam the girl gave it, i. e. the apple,
to a (the) boy.","[221, 222]"

The idea behind this grammar is the same as that behind its “twin”,
A Short Grammar of Lithuanian (Slavica 1996).","[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]"
"I Adnominal Function
1. Non-Partitive Genitive
The governing word can here be a noun or an adjective.
A. The governing Word is a Noun
In this case the genitive is in pre-position. The following functional types should be distinguished:
a) The Possessive GenitiveThe meanings of this genitive are those of possession and belonging:masasgramata sister's book, kokazari the branches of thetree.
It is worth noting that where an adjective would appear in languages like Slavic, Germanic and Romance, Latvian will often use a noun inthe genitive case, e.g. latvieSu valoda the Latvian language (lit. ‘the
language of the Latvians’).
b) The Subjective and c) the Objective Genitive
The governing words are here exclusively verbal nouns.
Examples of the subjective genitive:
skolnieka atbilde the pu-pil’s answer, armijas aplenkums the
siege of the army, Kolumba atklajums Columbus’ discovery, cf. the
corresponding verb phrases skolnieks atbild the pupil answers, armija
aplenc the army is besieging and Kolumbs atklaja Columbus disco-CASE167vered with skolnieks and Kolumbs in the function of subjects. As is
seen from the ilustrations, the subjective genitive is found with verbal
nouns derived both from intransitive and transitive verbs,
An example of the objective genitive is Amerikas atklaSana the
discovery of America, cf. atklat Ameriku to discover America with
Amerikaas object. Observethat only verbal nouns which correspondwith transitive (i. e. non-prepositional accusative governing) verbs can
be construed with the objective genitive. Other examples: bérnu audzinaSana upbringing of children (: audzinat
bérnus), armijas
aplenkSana the siege of the army, i.e. the army is besieged (: armija
ir aplenkta).","[163, 164]"
"©Chapter 8CASE
(Locijums)Introduction
A chapter on case should include both prepositional and non-prepositional use. However, certain considerations — both practical and theoretical — have led the author to treat prepositional functions in a separate
chapter under the heading “Prepositions”.
The syntactic functions of the oblique cases in Latvian, i. e. all cases except the nominative and the vocative, can be of three kinds:
1} adnominal (= govermed by a nominal word class, i. e. a noun,
an adjective, a pronoun or a numeral),
2) adverbal (= governed by a verb),
3) adverbial (= with the same function as an adverb)
We consider this disposition a practical and adequate one despite the fact that 3)
is not parallel with 1} and 2), since adverbial does not mean governed by an adverb, but
functioning as an adverb. An alternative and in a way more consistent solution would
have been to work with the notions ‘government’ (Latv. parvaldijums, see p. 200) and
‘juxtaposition’ (or ‘adjunction’, Latv. piek/avums, cf. p. 200), but in that case we would
have had to put under the government heading that which is dealt with both under 1)
and (the bulk of) 2) above, which in our view would have meant a less transparent and
practical disposition. Furthermore, the notion of primykanie (“juxtaposition”) — well
known in Russian and Latvian (and other East European) grammatical traditions, but
less in the West — would be unfamiliar to many readers.
A second altemative, namely to follow a scheme object vs, adverbial relations
would not have paid due attention to point 1).","[161, 162]"
"Chapter 14WORD ORDER
(Vardu seciba)Introductory Remarks
The introduction of a bipartite communicative analysis of the utterance, in theme(i. e. given or known information) and rheme(= newinformation), by Czech linguists (Mathesius, and further elaborated by
Dane§ and others) signified no less than a revolution with respect to our
knowledge about the mechanisms and principles that govern word order.
In prosodically neutral declarative sentences, the position of the
theme is initial, while the rheme occupies sentence final position. The
theme-rheme segmentation seems to be important in all languages, but is
of special importance in a non-article language like Latvian. In Germanic
and Romance languages the articles are of great help in identifying the
theme and the rheme, since the former usually adopts a definite form in
opposition to the latter, which normally shows either indefinite or zero
article, cf. the following example from English: — Yesterday I met an
old man (theme). The man/he (theme) was sitting outside a little, red
house (theme). The house/it (theme) had small windows (rheme). Thenotions theme and rheme make sense only within a context which is
built up by theme-rheme chains as illustrated in the above example.
A context must necessarily start at some point, whence the introductory part will usually be context non-dependent and consequently
themeless. For examples, see p. 223.
Languages without a case system, such as English and the Nordic
languages, do not offer the same possibilities for variations in word order
as do case languages. In the former type of languages word order has a
grammatical function. Thus, in sentences containing the three constitu-ents subject (S), verb (V) and object (O), the subject must occupy the
initial position in caseless languages whereas this is not obligatory in a
language like Latvian where the subject can be distinguished from the
object through the case ending, whereby their place in the sentence is not
so vital. Thus, in Latvian it is possible to say Péteris sita Povilu (SVO)222WORD ORDERor Povilusita Péteris (OVS).","[217, 218, 219]"
"2. The Long (Definite) Form
The following guidelines should be given:
The long form of the adjective can be used only in the function of
the attribute and the apposition, not in that of the predicative (except for
the superlative, cf. p. 60 above).
Basically its function is thematic, i. e. it designates something
whichis knownfromthe situation or context(“giveninformation’):Maza meitene raudaja the little girl was crying (note the definite article in English; in German, Dutch and the Nordic languages there is an
additionallead in the form of the adjective das kleine Mddchen, hetkleine meisje, den lille piken (Norwegian)).
In addition a set of formalized rules can be given. Thus, the use ofthe long (definite) form is obligatory:
1. after demonstrative pronouns: Sis jaunais direktors this young
director,62THE ADJECTIVEa2. after possessive pronouns and possessors in the genitive case:mana/vinu/téva jauna automasina my/their/father’s new car;
3 a) after the pronoun viss: visi jaunie pilsoni all new citizens;
3 b) after abi/abas: abas mazas masas both the little sisters;4. with propernouns: PéeterisLielais Peter the Great, mazaMarta little Martha; Méina jira the Black Sea.5. in address (vocative function): MiJie draugi dear friends.
Observe that in the singular the nominative form of the adjective is used
if the noun is also in the nominative case (e.g. mila mamina dear
mother); if the noun has a special vocative form, the adjective can eitherhave the form of the nominative or the accusative, i. e. miJ4 mamin or
milo mamin; milais tétin or milo tétin dear father).
6. in the expression vien- no [...] one of: viensnoievérojam-akajiem (comparative/superlative) latvieSu rakstniekiem ir Karlis
Skalbe Karlis Skalbe is one of the greatest Latvian writers.

of the white’).8. in so-called generic use: melna birza the black market, baltais
lacis white/polar bear, Sarkanais krusts The Red Cross.
Note: Deviations from these rules can be found in fiction. In
addition, it should be stated that the norm was less stable in older
writings.
Observe finally that some few adjectives (e.g. galvenais chief,
main; pédejais last) are always long.","[58, 59]"
"150THE VERB; NON-FINITE FORMSA. Indeclinable Gerunds
a) -Vm, refl.- Vmies:This gerund is used with an accompanying accusative object after
verbs of perception (verba sentiendi) and similar:
Dzirdéju Almu atbraucam uz Stokholmu
I have heard that Alma has come to Stockholm (lit. I (have)heard Alma coming to Stockholm).
The construction is parallel to the one indicated in the word-for-word translation
into English. In Old Latvian, the participle was declinable and occurred in the accusative
case in the construction in question, since syntactically it occupied the function of an apposition (cf. p. 202) which was in agreement with the object (Almu in the above example). The construction corresponds to the so-called “accusativus cum infinitivo”-construction in Latin, German, Nordic and certain other languages: audivi eum venire, Ichhérte ihn kommen, Norwegian jeg hgrte ham komme, expressed in English by J heard
him coming.","[146, 147]"
"Chapter 2THE NOUN
(Lietvards)Grammatical Categories
The grammatical categories of the Latvian noun are the same as
those of the other nominal parts of speech (adjective, pronoun, numeral),
namely gender, number and case. Some general remarks should be made
about these categories:
1. Gender
(Dzimte)There are only two genders, masculine and feminine, in Latvian.
The masculine is the unmarked member of this binary opposition which
is seen (among other things) in the fact that it is the masculine and-notthe feminine which has replaced the lost neuter in examples like ir skaidrs, ka it is clear that and others. To a certain extent, adverbformsending in -i can be said to fill the gap after the loss of the neuter, in such
constructions as vinai ir auksti she feels (lit. is) cold, vs. the unmarkedmasculine adjective form in Sodien ir auksts today it is cold, cf. p. 207.
Nouns are said to have an inherent gender, expressed through
agreement with modifiers (i. e. adjectives, participles, certain pronouns
and numerals).","[36, 37]"
"2. Partitive
a) A partitive function is encountered after some otherwise transitive verbs (i. e. verbs requiring a direct object in the accusative case),
such as (no)pirkt in (no)pirkt piena/puku buy (some) milk/flowers.
The genitive is here contrasted with the accusative, cf. (no)pirktpienu/pukes buy (all) the milk/the flowers. Other examples: ést siera
eat cheese, gribéties auglu want fruit.
Thus, an important opposition is apparent between the genitive —
expressing a part (hence the notion partitive) of the object encompassed
by the verbal action, and the accusative — implying command of the
whole object. However, in contemporary Latvian it seems possible also
to use the accusative instead of the genitive without any real difference in
meaning: ést sieru, gribéties auglus.
The genitive:accusative case opposition often corresponds to the
indefinite :definite opposition in languages which have developed a system of articles, such as English, German and the Nordic languages.
In Standard Russian the partitive function is restricted roughly to verbs in the
perfective aspect (compare for example kupit’ (pf.) xleba (gen.) ‘to buy (some) bread’ :
kupit xleb (acc.) ‘to buy (all) the bread’, but always pokupat (ipf.) xleb (acc.) ‘buy (the)
bread’. This principle is not observed in Latvian, cf. the imperfective pirkt buy above.",[169]
"THE NOMINATIVE
The nominative case has four main functions in Latvian:
1) as grammatical subject in two part sentences (see p. 205)
which can be in the active or passive voice (p. 135 ff.), e.g. bérns zimé
(suni) the child is drawing (a dog) and maja tiek celta the house is
buing built. Observe also the type man ir velosipéds (p. 178).
2) as the only principal member (galvenais loceklis) in so-called
nominative one part sentences (p. 207), e.g. vakars (it is) evening, and
3) as part of the nominal predicate (p. 198), i. e. in the form of a
nominal word class (i. e. a noun, adjective or pronoun) after acopulative verb (i. e. verbs with the meaning of be in a non-existential
sense and become, cf. also p. 198), e.g. vins (ir) bérns he is a child,
vins (ir) jauns he is young. Note the use of the nominative, not the
genitive case in the corresponding negative statement vinS nav
(copulative verb) bérns/jauns he is not a child/ young in opposition to,
for example, te nav bérnu there are no children here with an automaticgenitive after the existential verb nav.
Observe also formula saukt ko kas: vinu sauc Janis his name is
Janis (lit. ‘they call him John’) as well as the construction klit par (+
the accusative) to become in the sense of German werden zu: kJut par
arstu to become a physician.
In connection with 3) one may also mention the nominative after
ka as in constructions of the type vina ir zinama ka Joti interesanta
dzejniece she is known as a very interesting poet.
4) as object in debitive constructions (cf. p. 130), e.g. man
jaraksta véstule / have to write a letter. If the debitive predicate consists of a phasal auxiliary plus an infinitive, either the nominative or the
case required by the infinitive can be used: man jasak rakstit véstule
(nom.)/véstuli (acc.) J must begin writing the letter. The nominativeobject is avoided with pronouns of the Ist and 2nd person: man tevi (not
*tu) jaredz J have to see you (but: man vins jaredz/ have to see182CASEhim). Observe that the logical subject of the debitive construction is always in the dative case (cf. p. 130).
5) A last, but marginal function of the nominative is encounteredin certain appositions (see p. 219), e.g. romana
the novel “The Times of the Landsurveyors” .","[178, 179]"
"OVS-structures are far more common in case languages than in caseless ones, since in the former sentence members in initial position areTHE VERB: VOICE14]identified as cither object or subject by virtue of their grammatical form,
while in the latter where the initial position is earmarked for the function
of the subject, both in active and passive sentences.
Constructions without an Agent
As mentioned above, agentless passive sentences in English can
be translated by formally passive constructions in Latvian. Thus, the
sentence ‘he is bullied every day’ corresponds to Latvian vins tiek ap-celts katru dienu (where the participle agrees in gender, number and
case [ nominative] with the subject vins). However, it is also possible touse a formally active one-part sentence (cf. p. 205 ff.) with the structure
OV: vinu apce] katru dienu with a formally active OV-structure. Both
solutions have the patient (vins/vinu) in the thematic initial position.
Verb in the 3rd Person Active without an explicitly expressed
Subject
A quite analogous example is biJetes tiek pardotas Kasé tickets
are (being) soldat the cashier’s desk, i. e. a formally passive construction which can be replaced by the isofunctional active solution biJetes
pardod kasé. In the latter case the 3rd p. of the verb is used without an
explicitly expressed subject, corresponding to man-sentences in German
or Nordic(cf. GermanmanverkauftKartenin derKasse) or lo aformally passive construction: Karten werden in der Kasse verkauft,
tickets are sold in the cash-box.
Constructions of the Type ‘it is/was confirmed that [...]’
The standard way of rendering such cases in Latvian is to use the
above mentioned construction, i. e. 3rd p. active of the verb without asubject: apstiprinaja, ka [...] if was confirmed that [...]. A parallel
example is: So jautajumu apspriez (or: Sis jautajums tiek apspriests)
this issue is being discussed.","[137, 138]"
"In context-bound, non-emphatic sentences, the theme appears at
the beginning of the utterance, the rheme at the end. This theme-before-rheme order should be considered as a general rule. Furthermore, in140THE VERB:VOICEarticle languages (English, Nordic, Romance) a thematic noun will appear with a definite article whereas a rhematic noun is usually accompanied by an indefinite article. In non-article languages (such as
Latvian), the criterion for recognition of the theme is in fact its initial
position; see p. 221. The same is observed in English with proper names,
cf. Peter (thematic) beat Paul
beaten by Peter (rhematic).(thematic)vs. Paul(thematic)was2. Agent Deletion
Agent deletion occurs under the following circumstances:
a) when the agent is self-evident, of little relevance or difficult
to express; for example, ‘the glue should be applied carefully’ (by
whom? the owner/purchaser / user of the tube?); ‘a person who has
committed a crime, will be sentenced to x days in prison’ (by the judge/
court/community/state?),b) when the agent is avoided on purpose (so-called “agent-hiding’’): ‘Major heavily attacked yesterday’ (by one MP / a few MPs / the
entire Opposition / all MPs?).
In such cases, languages with an active:passive opposition
(Latvian, English etc.) will use a passive (or passive-equivalent) construction; see below.","[136, 137]"
"PREPOSITIONS185The preposition uz takes the accusative in the sense of to. When combined with the genitive it corresponds to English on (and rarely in).
Onepreposition(lidz until) governs the dative case. /t should,however, be emphasized that all semi-prepositions/adverbs (cf. above)
also require the dative case. Notice also that accusative- and genitivegoverning prepositions in certain idiomatic expressions combine with the
dative when followed by the demonstrative pronoun tas: bez tam besides; pie tam moreover (but bez ta without that, pie tam at (near)
that). Observe also the conjunction péc tam kad after (when).
Eight prepositions govern the accusative case. They will be mentioned in alphabetical order and should be learned by heart by the student:ap around, ar with, caur through, gar along, par about (concerning),
par across, pret against, towards and starp between, among.
All remaining prepositions govern the genitive which consequently
is the case most frequently encountered after prepositions in Latvian. The
two postpositions dé] and labad (together with laika) also require the
genitive case (adnominal genitive, cf. p. 166 ff.), since they originally
represent petrified noun forms. The genitive governing prepositions are
the following (in alphabetical order):aiz behind; across; after; because of (for), Aarpus outside, bez
without; except (but), dé) because of; for (the sake of); kop§ since,
labad for the sake of, no from; out of, otrpus on the other side, péc
after; for, pie at; with; to, pirms before; ago, prieks before, virs over;
above, zem under; beneath.","[181, 182]"
"Note the use of the dative case in predicative function in general
statements and when the logical subject is in the dative: nav ir viegli but
mazam(masc.)/mazai(fem.) it is not easy (for anyone) to be small,Janim nav viegli but mazam it is not easy for John to be small, levai
nav viegli but mazai it is not easy for Eve to be small.
In functions (1) and (2) the short (indefinite) form is used in the
environments where the long (definite) form (see p. 61 f.) is not used.
Thus, the short form is encountered in the rhematic function (p. 221), i.e. it designates something which is new or unknown in the situation or
context(“newinformation”):mazameitene alittle girl (note theindefinite article in English).
In function 3) the short form is used, e.g. meiteneir maza thegirl is small.
Equivalents of English than
|
In Latvian both the preposition par + the accusative and the conjunction neka (most frequently followed by the nominative) can corre-—THE ADJECTIVE61spond to English than: vina ir jaunaka par mani/neka es she is
younger than me. In negative utterances neka must be replaced by ka:
vina nav/nebija jaunaka ka es she is/was not younger than me.
Latvia are lower than in Norway it is self-evident that only neka is
possible to the exclusion of the accusative governing preposition par.
The conjunction neka is most frequently encountered in sentences of the type x
is -er than y which explains its frequent affinity with the nominative. The etymological
meaning of neka is not as/like, cf. the above example vina ir jaunaka neka es (esmu)
lit. she is younger:(and) not as/like I (am). The etymology of this conjunction also
explains the use of ka and not *neka in negative utterances.","[57, 58]"
"THE SENTENCE197The Principal Members
The Subject
(PriekSmets)Here we have in mind the grammatical subject, which is most frequently expressed by a noun or a pronoun in the nominative case. It can
also be expressed by a nominal form of the verb, i. e. the infinitive. For
examples, see under predicate below. In one-part sentences (for definition, see next chapter / section) there is no grammatical subject.
Omission of Subject Pronoun
In Latvian deletion (omission) of a personal pronoun in the function of a subject may take place in compound sentences, p. 208 ff.
(including participle constructions) in instances of the following kind:
Més apgajam tam apkart, un tas nozimé, ka esam kjuvuSi
drusku svétaki
Wewent around it (i. e. the hill), and that meansthat we havebecome more sacred;
Kad iepazinos ar Plasido, vins teica, ka gribot man palidzét
When I had become acquainted with Placido (Domingo), he saidthat he wanted to help me.
Vina teica, ka nevarot She said that she couldn’t
Note also the following example from a dialogue:
Un jums roks nepatik? - Patik - tad, kad vadu maSsinu vai
mazgaju traukus And you don’t like rock music? Oh, yes, I like it
when I am driving (my car) or am doing the dishes.","[193, 194]"
"During the Middle Ages, history, culture and religion separated
Latvia from Lithuania because the latter entered the Polish sphere of influence, while the former experienced an impact above all from German
language language and culture. Thus, the Teutonic and other orders invaded the territory corresponding to present-day Latvia and later on
Germans (consisting of gentry, tradesmen and clergy) settled there. In
terms of language, Latvian was also influenced by the now almost extinct
Livonian, which along with Estonian, Finnish and some minor languages
(Karelian, Vepsian,Votic) constitutes the Balto-Finnic branch of theFinno-Ugric language family.
In the vocabulary of Latvian several layers can be distinguished.
First, there is a basic IE vocabulary — for instance, the word for ‘heart’,sirds, which has cognates in other IE languages. The same is true for the
words for ‘mother’, ‘sun’, ‘moon’, ‘day’ etc: mate, saule, méness, di-ena. Then, there is the Balto-Slavic stratum, containing words knownexclusively within these two groups of IE; for instance, Latvian galva,
Lithuanian galva, Russian golova, Polish gtowa, meaning ‘head’ in all of
thelanguages quoted. Another example is the word for ‘hand, arm’:
Latvian roka, Lithuanian ranka, Russian ruka and Polish reka (all from20INTRODUCTIONearlier *ranka). A third layer may be discerned of words limited to the
group of Baltic languages alone, e. g. Latvian kaja and Lithuanian koja,
both meaning‘foot, leg’. If we continuewith the body, the wordfor‘hair’ may serve as an example of where the Baltic languages are split
from another: the Latvians say mati, the Lithuanians plaukai. This
scheme of several layers should not be oversimplified and regarded as an
automatic indicator in terms of chronology, but should be looked upon as
a purely guiding and schematic principle. Finally, both Latvian and its
sister language, Lithuanian, have through the centuries adopted a great
number of borrowings and international words from different sources
and languages, most frequently from or through (Old and Modern)
Russian (e. g. gramata book, dzinsi jeans) and (Low) German (e. g.
brokastis breakfast, slims ill, un and), but a Finno-Ugric (Livonian)impact (e. g. maja house, the interrogative particle vai) is also strongly
felt. Today the impact of English on the vocabulary is (of course)
considerable.
Latvian is spoken by roughly 1.5 million people in Latvia proper
which means about 55% of the population (the bulk of the remaining inhabitants are Russian speaking). In addition, there are approximately two
hundred thousand ethnic Latvians living abroad — above all in Germany,
Great Britain and Sweden and overseas in America and Australia.
The Latvian language map can be split into a number of subdialects. The main division, however, is that between High Latvian (or
Latgalian, in the east where we find such cities as Daugavpils and
Rézekne), and Low Latvian. Low Latvian is divided between the Centraldialect (encompassing such centers as Riga and Jelgava) and the so-called
Tamian dialect (found on both sides of the outer parts of the Riga Bay,
as well as the area around the city of Ventspils). Although the standardization process took a relatively long time, the Modern Standard language came into use during the second half of the 19th century, on the basis
of the Central dialect (Latv. vidus dialekts). Several factors favored thisdialect to become the foundation of the Standard language; i. e., presence
of important economic, commercial and cultural centers within the region where this dialect is spoken, as well as a lesser degree of influence
from neighbouring foreign languages (Slavic and Finno-Ugric) than in
High Latvian and the Tamian dialects.
The use of the Latvian language was hampered by German supre-macy over the centuries. In this century, its use was limited during the
Soviet regime (1945-1991), but today it has regained the dominant role
it had achieved during the first period of independence (1920-1940). A
manifestation of this is the Latvian Language Law of 1989 (with
subsequent Amendments), according to which Latvian is given the status
of the official State Language of Latvia.","[16, 17]"
"B. SyntaxThe (logical) subject of the debitive is in the dative case, e.g.
Man (ir) jaruna / must/have to speak.
Note also that in sentences with an adjective in the function of apredicative, the adjective must be in agreement with the dative subject
and therefore appear in the dative case, ¢.g.
Studentiem jabut uzmanigiemThe students have to be attentive
Moreover, the object of a transitive verb appears in the nominative, and not the accusative case, e.g.man jalasa avize! have to read the newspaper
Note: The accusative should, however,be used in two contexts,namely after a transitive infinitive or if the object is a pronoun of the Ist
or 2nd person, cf.
Man jasak fasit avizil have to begin to read the newspaper
Ojaram bis mus jaapmekle Ojars will have to look for us
Observe that when the dative subject is deleted, a general meaning
(English “one”. German/Nordic “man”, French “on’”) is obtained:
Kad ddens smelas muté, jamacas peldét (Latvian proverb)THE VERB:WhenMOOD131the water is streaming into the mouth, one has to learn toswim,
C. Alternative Constructions
The debitive meaning can also be rendered in other ways, namely
by:a) the impersonal verb (cf. p. 206) vajadzet (pres. vajag, pret. vajadzéja), c.g. vinam vajag stradat he must work, $0 uzdevumuvajagpadarit this task has to be done (observe the accusative $0 uzdevumu
due to its object function dependent on (vajag) padarit — in contrast to
the example quoted under c) where Sis uzdevums is in the position of a
grammatical subject and therefore appears in the nominative case),
b) the impersonal verb nakties (pres. nakas, pret. nacas): mums
nakas aizbraukt we have to leave (go),c) the passive m-participle: Sis uzdevums ir padarams this task
has to be done.
Whereas the debitive construction implies objective necessity, the
vajadzét-construction designates obligation or moral necessity (Englishshall/should), Classical contrastive illustrations are jums jadzer téja you
have to drink tea (because there is no coffee) and jums vajag dzert
téju you have to (= should) drink tea (because it is healthy/good for
you). The nakties-construction as a rule expresses inevitability (like the
impersonal verb prichodit’sya in Russian).","[127, 128]"
"70THE PRONOUNNotice the locution kas par + accusative: what kind of (German
was fiir ein): kas
that)?(tasir) pardzivnieku? what kind of animal(isRelative Function
The relative pronoun agrees with its correlate in gender and number, whereas case is determined by its function (subject, object etc.) in
the subordinate clause, e. g. te ir gramata (fem. sg. nom.), kuru/ko
(fem. sg. acc. = object) tu man devi here is the book (which) you gave
me. Unlike in English (and some other languages, among them the
Nordic languages), the relative pronoun can never be omitted in Latvian.
The genitive of kas is used only after prepositions, e. g. to
cilvéku, pie ka més bijam vakar, sauc Valdmanis the person with
whom we were yesterday, is called Valdmanis.
In the non-prepositional function of whose? the genitive of kur§ is
used, i. e. kura for the masc. sg., kuras for the f. sg. and kuru for the
plural (both genders): te ir puika, kura tévs [...] here is the boy whosefather [...], te ir meitene, kuras tévs [...] here is the girl whose father
[...J, te ir bérni, kuru tévs [...] here are the children whose father [...].","[66, 67]"
"We will proceed below according to the scheme 1 - 3 and describe
the functions of the cases in the following order: the genitive, the accusative, the dative and the locative. The description will also include a
small typed note on the instrumental, for the status of which, see p. 41.
Finally, the functions of the two non-oblique cases, the nominative and
the vocative, will be dealt with.",[162]
"The Object
(Papildinatajs)
Like the subject, the object is usually expressed through one of the
nominal word classes, noun or pronoun, but — unlike the subject — it
must be in a dependent, i. e. non-nominative case (except for the nominativeobjectin debitive constructions,see p.",[196]
"219Kasis used with singular agreement, irre-spective of the number of persons or objects referred to: Kas ir atnacis —Janis un Péteris, vai tikai Janis? who has come — John and Peter or
just (only) John? (It should further be noted that in the Standard langu-age kas shows only masculine agreement, not feminine.)
H. Group Subjects
Finally, mention should be made of group subjects with quantifiers
in the role of grammatical head, accompanied by a noun or pronoun in
the genitive plural: jau ir atnacis daudz Jauzu lit. much people has alreadyarrived.",[216]
"Chapter 13AGREEMENT
(Saskanojums)Agreement is one of the three ways of expressing subordination in
Latvian (cf. p. 200) and can be defined as a morphological repetition
(through desinences) of one and the same grammatical category within
certain syntactic relations.
Relevant grammatical categories are: 1. gender, 2. number, 3.
person and 4. case, and the relevant syntactic relations are:
A. that between attribute and governing word, cf., for example,
jauna maja : jaunas majas : jaunu maju a new house : of a new
house : of new houses where the attributive adjective agrees in gender,
number and case with the head noun,B. that between the subject and predicate, e.g. maja ir jauna :
majas ir jaunas the house is new : the houses are new (agreement in
gender, number (and case) between the subject and the nominal part of
the nominal predicate), and
C. that between the antecedent and the anaphoric pronoun
(including the relative) as, for instance, in: kada parka sédéja virietis.
Ar vinu runaja sieviete there was a man sitting in a park. A woman
was speaking with him; [...] virietis, ar ko runaja sieviete [...]a manwith whom a woman was speaking.
For convenience, relation A. is generally referred to as attributive
agreement and B. as predicate agreement. Relation C. will only be marginally commented upon.
There are two kinds of agreement: formal (or grammatical), and logical
(semantic). The explanation above relates only to the former type. To cover logical
agreement, the definition should be modified as follows: systematic covariation between
a formal or semantic property of one element and a formal property of another. An
example of logical agreement would be: jau ir atnakuSi liels daudzums gaju putnu a
large number of birds of passage have already arrived, whereas formal agreement
would be jau ir atnacis liels daudzums gaju putnu a /arge number of birds of pas-sage has arrived with the participle atnacis in agreement with (liels) daudzums in
gender, number and case (nominative). The English translation illustrates logical vs.","[211, 212]"
"I Adnominal Dative
1. The governing Word is a Noun
The dative case may be accompanied by certain nouns derived
from adjectives and verbs which require the dative case (see below), e.g.
pateiciba kam gratefulness to sby (: pateicigs kam grateful to sby),
kaitigumsveselibaiharm(destructiveness)to health (: kaitigskamharmful to sby/sth., kaitét kam harm sby/sth.) atbilde kam answer to
sby (: atbildét kam answer sby), palidziba kam help to sby (: palidzét kam help sby), parmetums kam reproach to sby (: parmest
kam sby reproach sby).
2. The governing Word is an Adjective
The adjective lidzigs alike, similar is construed with the dative,
e.g. vins ir lidzigs tévam he is like his father, Sis trijstiris ir lidzigs
otram trijstirim this triangle is similar to another/the other triangle.
Another dative governing adjective is derigs useful, e.g. gramatika ir—CASE177deriga studentiem grammar is useful to the students. In this case, the
use of the dative is easy to grasp, in opposition to lidzigs. Adjectives
with the meaning of similarity are, however, often construed with the
dative case in Indo-European languages: for example, German gleich
(mir), Lithuanian
‘(a)like (sth.)’.lygus kam‘alike sby/sth.’,Russianravno(Cemu)Note that the adjectives vienlidzigs equal and proporcionals proportional are not construed with the dative case, but with the preposition
ar (+ the accusative).","[173, 174]"
"The Accusative in Exclamations
Finally and separately, mention should be made of the accusative
in exclamations, e.g. tavu muJki! you fool!
For the use of the possessive pronoun, cf. also Nordic din idiot ‘you fool’ which
may represent a genitive form of the personal pronoun reinterpreted as a possessive. If
this interpretation is correct, we would in a historical perspective be dealing with a genitivus definitivus, cf. p. 167f. Could the Latvian construction with an unambiguous
possessive pronoun be explained through Swedish intermediary? Besides this
construction,Latvianalso has at its disposalan alternative constructionwiththepersonal pronoun which is known from a number of European languages: tu muJki.",[172]
"Note especially the transitional case between the adverbial and adverbal functions. As adverbal function may be regarded the locative after verbs expressing motion with the prefix ie- in(to), e.g. ieiet istaba
go into / enter the room. This use of the locative is surprising to students
familiar with German or Slavic case languages, where this is a typical
accusative sphere. The situation is parallel to that after verbs expressing
motion, in cases like vilkt mugura take on (about clothes), lit. pull onthe back, likt galva mici put the cap on one’s head, aut kajas lit. take
/ put on the feet (about shoes and similar). Note finally sasalt ledu
freeze (in)to ice, as well as the adnominal type kalna kapéjs “alpinist”
(lit. climber onto the hill).",[177]
"2. Possessive Pronouns
A. Non-Reflexives
The pronouns of this class might also be labeled personal, along
with the preceding ones. It has, however, become customary to group
them under a separate heading as possessive pronouns, according to their
specialized function. The group encompasses mans/-na my/mine, tavs/va your(s), savs/-va one’s own (declined as short form adjectives, cf. p.
57-58) and vina his, vinas her(s), musu our(s), jisu your(s), and vinu
their(s), which are all undeclined regardless of the gender, number andcase of the word to which they refer.
The latter five are merely the genitive case of the corresponding
personal pronouns (see point 1 above). The others (mans, tavs, savs) aredeclined like the short form of the adjective (type masc. labs, fem.
laba).",[63]
"Il THE POSITION OF THE MEMBERS
NOUN PHRASEOF THEA noun phrase can be defined as a word group (vdrdkopa) consisting of a combination of two or more words of a nominal class, consti-tuting a semantic unit. One word (a noun) in the group occupies the role
of grammatical head, under which the other constituent/s is/are subordinated (through agreement, government or juxtaposition, see pp. 200 and
215).
Non-Participle Attributes
Examples: jauna maja (a) new house (agreement), téva maja father’s house (government). These are simple word groups in opposition
to complex: jauna téva maja father’s new house.
A typical example of “juxtaposition” (p. 200) could be the
combination of a verb and an adverb (e. g. iet atri to walk fast), butverbal word groups of this kind have practically already been dealt with
under I above.
The neutral position of attributes, both congruent (expressed by
adjectives, adjectival pronouns and numerals) and non-congruent
(expressed by nouns and certain pronouns), is before the governing noun,
i.e. jauna maja (maja jauna would be understood as the house is
new), téva maja (but: vina jauna maja his new house), alus pudele a
new house, father’ house, a beer bottle. Exceptions to this rule are

"Chapter 4THE PRONOUN
(Vietniekvards)The pronoun is a heterogeneous word class. The following
description will be based on more or less traditional classificatory criteria.
Many pronouns are characterized by a special pronominal inflection, whereas others follow the pattern of adjectives.
In terms of syntax a distinction is often made between adjectival
and non-adjectival (substantival) pronouns. Whereas the former are sub-ordinated to a head noun in gender, number and case (attributive function), the latter can be used “independently” like a noun. Certain pronouns can be used in both the adjectival and substantival function.","[61, 62]"

Oslo, in December 1996Terje MathiassenChapter 0INTRODUCTIONLatvian and Lithuanian (along with the extinct Old Prussian) to the
Baltic language group which constitutes a branch of its own of the IndoEuropean (IE) family of languages. To IE also belong the Slavic languages — among them Russian, Byelorussian and Polish — as well as the
Germanic languages, whose main members are English, German, Dutchand the Nordic languages. Thus, there is a remote link between English
and Latvian. Within the Indo-European framework the Baltic languages
are more closely related to the Slavic branch than to any other IE linguistic subdivision. The alleged similarities between Baltic and Slavic
should, however, not be exaggerated. At any rate, there is obviously no
mutual understanding between — let us say — a Russian and a Latvian
when they speak their mother tongues, whereas a Russian and a Pole will
(to a certain extent) be able to communicate.","[14, 15, 16]"
"Examples:
zenam neapnika skatities the boy didn’t get bored by looking,
mitrais gaiss kaitéja veselibai the moisty air did harm to the healthFurther mention should be made of some additional dative-governing verbs which are not so easy to incorporate in the framework of the
verba commodi et incommodi. Here belong verbs like atbildét kam answer sby, piederét kam belong to sby, parmest sby reproach sby, gatavoties kam prepare for sth.
Under this heading, one should also mention dative + nominativeconstructions (with the latter in the role of grammatical subject), e.g.
man(ne)garsogala/ (don’t) like meat, man(ne)patikSita filma /(don’t) like this film, cf. point 5 below.
4. Dative + ir/bija/bus etc. as Equivalents to haveConstructions in English
In opposition to have-languages, such as English, German, the
Nordic languages and Romance, Latvian (like Russian, Balto-Finnic
languages and many others) is a be-language, e.g. man ir (bija, bus, ir
bijis, bija bijis, bus bijis) velosipéds / have (had, shall have, have
had, had had, will have had) a bicycle (lit. for me is/was etc. bicycle).",[175]
"Reflexive Passives
As mentioned above (p. 136), Latvian admits formal reflexive
passives, but only within considerable constraints. Thus, reflexive
passives are not used where the role of an agent is important, e. g. in
*biJetes pardodas kasé or *plans izpildas veiksmigi. This use of the
reflexive in the function of a passive is felt to be a “Russianism” and is
avoided. In the former example one would have to choose one of the two
constructions mentioned above (i. e. biletes tiek pardotas kasé orbiletes pardod kasé). The same holds true for the latter, 1. e. plans tiek
izpildits veiksmigi or planu izpilda veiksmigi (‘the plan is carried out
successfully’).priya te142THE VERB; VOICEThe reflexive passive construction is possible in cases such as
gramatas glabajas biblioteka books are kept in the library and nazis
pilnigi nolietojies the knife is totally worn out (both cases quoted from
Ceplite & Ceplitis 1991).
Formal Passives with Intransitive Verbs
In a caseless language like English, passive participles are formed
from transitive verbs, i. e. verbs with an object. In case languages the
formation of passive participles is as a rule equally limited to transitive
verbs, but the definition of transitivity is different, since here transitiveverbs are understood to be verbs with an object in the accusative case. A
peculiarity of Latvian, however, is that formally “passive” constructions
are also possible with intransitive verbs.
Thus, “passive” constructions of this type are frequently encountered in Latvian. They must be in the form of a one-part impersonal sen-tence (cf. p. 206) with the participle in the (unmarked) masculine
(singular) form (see p. 40). A much quoted example in grammars of
Latvian is diezgan jau ir staigats lit. it has been walked quite a lot already. A parallel example would be visu nakti bija dejots, lit. it was
danced all night long. Note the correspondence with English constructions with a formal (semantically empty subject) it.
These were examples of intransitive (or intransitively used) verbs.","[138, 139]"
"B. Syntax
Declinablecardinalnumbers(withtheexceptionof simts,tukstotis, miljons) have adjectival syntax, i. e. they agree in gender,
number and case with an accompanying quantified noun: man ir divi
lati / divas gramatas / have two lats / two books, es iedevu divus latus
/ divas gramatas savam draugam / gave two lats / two books to my
friend, vins ir atbraucis uz Rigu ar diviem latiem / divam gramatam
he has come to Riga with two lats / two books.
Indeclinable cardinal numbersas well as simts, tikstotis,andmiljons have substantival syntax, i. e. they behave like nouns by requiring the genitive (plural) of the accompanying noun, e. g. (man ir)
desmit/vienpadsmit/divdesmit/simts/tikstotis/miljons latu/gramatu
(1 have) ten/eleven/twenty/hundred/thousand/one million lats/booksNUMERALSTt(like celasoma latu/gramatu a suitcase of lats/books, cf. the partitive
adnominal genitive, p. 169 below).
The claim that indeclinable numerals require a following genitive
needs an important modification since
1) this rule is restricted to cases where the numeral — or to be moreprecise, the numeral + noun group — occupies a nominative or accusative
position, i. e. as subject or object to a transitive verb (i. e. an accusativegoverning verb) or in the function of an adverbial of time; in other oblique cases the following noun must be in the genitive, dative or locative,depending on the syntactic environment;
2) in nominative (and partly accusative) position the noun can also
be in the nominative (or accusative with accusative representation).
Illustrations:subject function:gen. or nom.atnaca desmit zénu/meitenu or zéni/meitenes
ten boys / girls came
Note: the nominative construction is mandatory when a declinableattribute precedes the group, e. g. visi desmit zéni/meitenes atnaca all
ten boys/girls came.
object function:
after transitive
verbs:gen. or acc.més sastapam desmit zénu/meitenu or
zénus/meiteneswe met ten boys/girls
When preceded by a declinable attribute, the group must be in the
accusative case: més sastapam visus desmit zénus / visas desmit meitenes we met all ten boys / girls.
adverbial of
time:preferably
accusativevini bija / pavadija desmit dienas Riga
they were / spent ten days in Rigagenitive function:
desmit valstu okupacija
occupation of ten states78NUMERALSdative function:vins palidzéja desmit zéniem / meiteném
he helped ten boys/girls
locative function:
vinS atrada vinas fotografiju desmit
gramatashe found her photograph in ten books
Note: The numerals10-20 are declined only in connection withthe hours of the day (the clock), e. g. vina
desmitiem she cameat ten / aroundatnacaten (o'clock),/ ap—cf. the questiondesmitos—cikos vina atnaca? at what time did she come? Thus, constructions of
the type *ar desmitiem zéniem with ten boys, *desmitos darzos in ten
gardens are impossible. For further expressions of hours of the day (the
clock), see chapter 10.
In cases with quantifierslike daudz much, maz little, vairakmore and similar (cf. p. 170) a grammatical conflict may arise. The
following guidelines should be given: the genitive governing power is
lost in the plural after prepositions, cf. ar daudz gramatam with many
books(alternativeconstruction:ardaudzamgramatam).","[73, 74, 75]"
"For genitive-governing verbs with meanings ‘to be lacking’ and
‘to be sufficient’, see next paragraph.
B. Negative Constructions
a) Whereas in positive statements the direct object of transitive
verbs is in the accusative case, in the corresponding negated sentences the
object can be in the genitive, especially in the case of a double negation
(ne + ne), e.g. neredzét neviena makona not see a single cloud, nelasit avizu not read papers.
In today’s Latvian there is a tendency to use the accusative rather
than the genitive in such cases, e.g. nelasit avizes rather than nelasit
avizu.
The origin of this genitive of negation, which is also found in Slavic, with parallels in Balto-Finnic languages, remains obscure. Some scholars hold it to be of an ablative (deprivative) nature (cf. the b-verb sphere in the preceding paragraph), while others
tend to connect it with the partitive.b) The (logical) subject (= grammatical object) of negated existential and related constructions is always in the genitive in Latvian, for|172CASEexample: zoologiskaja darza nebija lauvu in the zoo there were no lions, téva paSlaik nay majas father is not at home at present.
In the corresponding positive statements, the genitive must be replaced by the nominative (in the role of a grammatical subject): zoologiskaja darza bija lauvas; tévs paSlaik ir majas.
The genitive is further used with the verbs netrukt not be lacking
(be sufficient), nepietikt not be sufficient (be lacking), e.g. nepietiek
spéka there is not sufficient strength/force.
Note: The genitive is mandatory with these two verbs, even when
they are not accompanied by a negation: triikst lidzekJu there is a lack
of means, pietiek lidzekJu there is enough/sufficient means. With the-se verbs a nuance of partitiveness is felt, cf. next section.","[168, 169]"
"B. Extended Sentences
a) Adverbial ExtensionsAdverbial modifiers can simply be placed before the V in VS type
sentences: istaba iegaja meitene into the room a girl entered; uz sienas
karajas glezna on the wall a painting is hanging. These AdvVS structures with thematic adverbial + rhematic subject are in contrast to SVAdvconstructions with thematic subject + rhematic adverbial: meitene iegaja
istaba the girl entered the room, glezna karajas uz sienas the painting
is hanging on the wall.
The structure AdvSVis also encountered, e.g. svétdienas avizesneiznaca on Sundays newspapers were not published.
b) Object Extensions
One Object
Such sentences have to some extent already been commented upon,
in the examples quoted above, namely SVO (Péteris sita Povilu) vs.
OVS (Povilu sita Péteris), under introductory remarks (p. 221 f.). For
that illustration a transitive verb (sist) was chosen. The definition oftransitivity in caseless languages, however, differs from that which is
valid for case languages. In the former group, a verb can be defined as
transitive without any constraint as to the nature of the object by which it
is accompanied,whereasin the latter (as a rule), onlyverbswhichgovern the accusative (without involvement of prepositions) can be
transitive, i. e. can be “transformed” from active to passive or vice versa.",[221]
"—Chapter 9PREPOSITIONS
(Prievards)This is a natural continuation of the immediately preceding chapter
on Case, which we found convenient to reserve almost exclusively fornon-prepositional use, even though a full description of case should
include prepositions as well. The purpose of this chapter on prepositions
is to give a brief survey of the prepositions most commonly encountered
in modern Standard Latvian and information on the case(s) required afterthem, their meanings presented in simple, illustrative examples. A less
practically oriented grammar should in addition have paid attention to a
number of theoretical, semantic and grammatical aspects concerning prepositions and case grammar.
Preposition vs. Prefix
In a number of cases prepositions and prefixes (see 159 ff.) show
the same form, namely aiz, ap, no, pa, par, par, pie and uz.
Preposition vs. Adverb. Semi-Prepositions
There is also a formal overlapping between certain prepositions
and adverbs, e.g. priekS/a in front (of).
Moreover, Latvian has a set of prepositions which may be said to
be primarily adverbs. They can be referred to as semi-prepositions or
prepositional adverbs. Some examples: cauri right through (cf. the
preposition caur below), garam (cf. the preposition gar) along, pari
across (cf. the preposition par), preti (cf. preposition pret) against.
IHustration of use: més gajam garam we went past (function as adverb):més gajam garam upei we went (were going) along the river
(function as preposition). Contrast further cases like pariet par ielu : iet
pari ielai to cross the street where the preposition par is used with theperfective verb, whereas the imperfective partner is accompanied by the
semi-preposition/adverb pari. For oppositions of this type, section on
aspect in chapter 6 should be consulted. These adverb-prepositions posit
a problem, in that they can be either preposited or postposited to the184PREPOSITIONSnoun, according to somewhat obscure rules. Thus, for example, iet pari
+ noun seems to be preferred to (the equally possible) sequence iet +
noun + pari. With cauri, however, the tendency seems to be the
opposite, i. e. noun + cauri rather than cauri + noun (cf. for example
Skérsliem cauri through obstacles). However, as a rule of thumb
preposition/postposition is optional.
As pointed out on several occasions in this grammar, Latvian is very interesting
in a typological perspective, i. e. in a transitional stage between Indo-European and
Finno-Ugric. With respect to prepositions Latvian can be said to offer a compromise
between the two groups of languages in that it has developed a set of adverbs (FinnoUgric type) alongside prepositions (Indo-European type). The former have partly adopted prepositional (or rather postpositional) properties.","[179, 180, 181]"
"The negated counterpart to the sentence just quoted is man nav
(nebija, nebus, nav bijis, nebija bijis, nebus bijis) velosipéda / don’t
have (didn’t have, shall not have, have not had, had not had, shall not
have had) with a logical subject (= velosipéda) in the genitive case, cf.p. 17I1f.
Here one may also mention the verb of belonging piederét whichis construed in a similar way, e.g. man pieder velosipéds/ have a
bicycle (lit. to me belongs bicycle), again with velosipéds in the function of a grammatical subject, whence the nominative is required. When
‘belong to’ has the meaning of “belonging to a category / class’ and not
‘as property’, the prepositional construction piederét pie must be used,
e.g. lauva pieder pie zvériem the lion belongs to the wild animals, cf.",[175]
"B. Syntax
Ordinal numbers have adjectival syntax, i. e. they agree with the
head noun in gender, number and case, e. g.
vina jau desmitaja klasé she is already in the tenth form
Years and dates are expressed by ordinal numbers.
To answer the question when? the locative case is used for the
year: vins ir dzimis tikstoS devinsimt devindesmit sestaja gada he is
born in the year 1996.
The Jocative is also used for answering the when-question for dates, e. g. Vins atbrauca piecpadsmitaja augusta he arrived on August
In the case of a month-yearcombination with a when-question,the date appears in the locative case whereas the year has the form of
a preposited adnominal genitive (cf. p. 158 below): vins ir dzimis
tikstos devinsimt devindesmit sesta gada piecpadsmitaja augusta he
“is born on August 15, 1996.
For translating a sentence like ‘today is August 15, 1996’ the nominative, not the locative, of the date expression must be used (becausesyntactically it occupies the function of a grammatical subject): Sodien ir
tuikstoS devinsimt devindesmit sesta gada piecpadsmitais augusts.
In written exposition numerals are, of course, usually encounteredinstead of written-out number words.",[76]
"Note also assimilations of the type:
*ljs > *I’'s > [lf ] (in, for example, celS way, road vs. cela, cf. p.
42),
*rjs > *r’s > [rf ] (in, for example, Kars war, vs. gen. kara, cf.p. 42). The r subsequently lost its softening, see p. 24.
The last assimilation which should be mentioned is:nk > yk: banka [’banka] bank
ng > ng: bungas [‘bungas] drum
(which means that the dental /n] is replaced by its velar allophone
[ny] before a velar stop).
The same kind of assimilation is known in English. In Nordic languages thesame phenomenon is observed in the case of nk. For ng it should be added that in many
cases [n] is spoken alone, without the subsequent [g], in Nordic.",[24]
"1) The simplest structure is represented by sentences consisting of
the principal member only. Here belongs a group of verbs incapable of
taking an object, for instance, the “meteorological” aust become light/
dawn, tumst becomedark, lit rain, smidzinat drizzle, snigt snow, zi-benot flash (of lightning), salt freeze.
Examples: tumsa it was becoming dark, salst it is freezing, sniga
it was snowing. With some of the verbs a tautological noun in the nominative case may be added, thus changing the structure into a personal
(automatically two-part) sentence: list or list lietus it is raining (lit. ‘the
rain is raining’).",[203]
"Note: consonant length is in this case not reflected in the orthography in contrast to:
b) words like balle ball, feast, dilemma dilemma where one long
consonant is pronounced, i. e. [l:] and [m:] respectively. Such gemination in orthography is not characteristic of Latvian, but is found in a—
number of borrowings (such as those just mentioned). In autochthonic
(indigenuous) words they are encountered only very rarely (e. g. mellene
[‘mel:ene] blueberry),c) two consonants in word final position are pronounced as one
semi-long consonant. This pertains also to cases where two consonants in
this environment become identical as the result of an assimilation (p. 26):ass (masc. sg. nom.) sharp, balss (masc. sg. nom.) voice, pareizs
[‘pareis-] correct, mezs [meJ-] forest.d) a long (or semi-long) consonant is also pronounced where there
is a prefix ending in the same consonant as the initial consonant of the
word root, for example attistiba [‘at:i:sti:ba] development, parraidit
[‘pa:r:aidi:t] broadcast. The same holds true for instances like atdot
[‘ad:uot] return, give back. Observe further compounds of the type pussala [‘pus:ala] peninsula, lappuse [‘lap:use] page.
In all other instances short consonants are spoken. It should be
emphasized that quantity relations may differ from those found in most
of the modern Germanic languages (English, German, Dutch, the Nordic
languages), since Latvian can have short consonants between shortPHONOLOGY
vowels, as for example
nom.) small.in labi [‘labi] well, maza39
[‘maza](fem.sg.","[35, 36]"
"III Adverbial Function
The adverbial function of the Latvian genitive is very marginal.
One can even question if it exists at all. The only possible candidate seems to be the genitive of time, in cases like ik (par)dienas every
(second)day, ik(par)nedéJas every(second)week, ik(par)naktisCASEevery(second)night, ik reizes every173time. The endings-as/ -es / -isare (at least in a diachronic perspective) most probably to be analyzed as
genitive singular forms, and not as accusatives plural (irrespective of cases like ik gadus, on which see below). The question arises as to whether
the genitive is not ultimately determined by ik, in which case we could
be dealing with a partitive genitive after a quantifier of the cik-type,
cf. p. 162. The etymology and grammatical status of ik, however,
remains obscure. Equally puzzling is the fact that in a number of cases,
the accusative (not the genitive) is used after ik, e.g. ik bridi every
moment (minute), ik minuti every minute, ik stundu every hour, ik
vakaru (beside the accusative plural vakarus) every evening, ik ménesievery month, ik gadu (beside the accusative plural gadus) every year.
From a synchronic point of view, both the genitive-like forms and the
accusative forms have been adverbialized. Instead of the ik-construction,one can use the pronoun katr- every: katru dienu, katru gadu etc. (i.
e. with an adverbial accusative, cf. p. 174).","[169, 170]"
"I Adverbal Accusative
Latvian verbs can govern different oblique cases, the genitive, the
accusative,the dative and the locative. Theabsolute majorityof the174CASEverbs, however, require the accusative (as a direct object) and are called
transitive, e.g. lasit vestuli to read a
house.letter, uzbuvétmaju to build a—A basic feature of verbs with the accusative is that they can be
transferred from active to passive forms, cf. lasit véstuli / uzbuvét
maju to read a letter / to build a house : lasama véstule / uzbuvéta
maja, cf. p. 157.
A special type of accusative object, so-called “inner object” is encountered in cases like domat domu lit. to think a thought, dziedat
dziesmu fo sing a song, dejot deju to dance a dance.
In opposition to the Slavic languages, where reflexive verbs are
more or less incapable of governing the accusative case, this restriction is
not observed to the same extent in Baltic, where an accusative object can
also be governed by a reflexive verb: for example, nopirkties jaunu
velosipédu to buy a new bicycle, macities matematiku to learn
(study) mathematics, izgaidities vilcienu to wait for the train, atceréties pasaku fo recall a fairy-tale. The meaning of the reflexive is
here “in one’s own interest” (cf. p. 143 under reflexive and non-reflexive
verbs).","[170, 171]"
"3. Reciprocal Pronouns
Latvian has two reciprocal pronouns, viens/viena otr- and cits/cita
cit-, both meaning each other, one another. There is, however, a differ-ence in use in that viens/viena otr- is applied with reference to two (or
pairs) whereas cits/cita cit- refers to more than two.
The first element (viens/viena; cits/cita) is always in the nominative case and singular in number, whereas the case of the second (otr-,cit-) is determined by its syntactic position!. Both elements are inflected
according to gender.
Examples:
Vini mil cits citu! they love each other (vini either points to a
group of males or a mixed group consisting of males and females — to
designate a group of females alone, the form vinas must be used); Aina
un Péteris mil viens otru Aina and Peter love one another; vini sédéja
viens blakus otram (i. e. vini s¢déja: viens blakus otram) they were
sitting next to each other; Aina un Andasédéja viena blakusotraiAina and Anda were sitting next to one another. If one says més
patikam viens otram we like each other, més (we) can imply more
than two, but in that case it seems that one is referring to pairs of two
and two.
Ithe construction can probably be understood in the light of historical syntax
through a bifurcation into two sentences *Vini mil and *Viens (nominative subject)
(mil) otru They love. One (loves) the other. The two sentences were then combined into
one unit: Vini mil viens otru with deletion (omission) of the second mil.",[64]
"The reason for the appearance of the participle in the dative case in
the infinitive is to be found in the section on syntax, p. 146,
For the choice of aspect, i. e. the prefixed (perfective) form of the
participle vs. the unprefixed (imperfective) form, see the general principles set forth in the section on Aspect (and Tense), p. 115 ff.
B. Other Moods than the Indicative (Marked Moods)Beyond in the indicative mood, the passive can also be expressed
in the subjunctive, the relative, the© imperative (rarely) and
at id (extremely rately) the debitive.

2. Expression of the Passive Voice in English
In the interest of a contrastive perspective, a coupleof wordsshould also be said about the formation of the passive in English.
In English the passive voice is expressed through the combination
of one auxiliary (be) with one participle (i. e. the past passive participle,
see the English translations in the above paradigms.
The Romance languages and (most of) the Slavic also have a passive morpho-logy of the same type as English.
The morphological make-up of the German and the Nordic Passive has analy

SOYMotivations for choosing Passive Constructions.
General Considerations
Generally speaking, there are two important motivations for choosing a passive construction over an active:Bote1, Passive constructions have a different functional sentence perspective (FSP) than the corresponding active, called “theme-rheme”
structure,
2. Passive constructions admit deletion (omission) of the agent
1. Functional Sentence Perspective (FSP)
The following two sentences have differing functional sentenceperspectives:
(1) The workmen are building a house
(2) The house is being built by workmenIn (i) ‘the workmen’ belongs to the theme (i. e. is part of the given information) whereas ‘a house’ is rhematic (i. e. brings new information). In (2) the situation is the reverse: ‘the house’ is thematic,
‘workmen’ rhematic.","[134, 135, 136]"
"Definitions
From a semantic point of view, a passive construction can be defined as an utterance in which the grammatical subject refers to the patient (literally ‘the suffering’), i. e. the one against whom the action is
directed. For example, in ‘I was bullied (by him)’, in contrast to an ac-tive, where the grammatical subject (‘he’) refers to the agent, i.e. the
performer of the action: ‘he bullied me’. (An alternative is to define thepassive in positive terms and the active in negative by stating that all
constructions which are not passive, are active.)In the active sentence quoted above, the agent is expressed by the
grammatical subject he, the patient by the object me. In the passive it isjlthe other way around: the patient is expressed by the subject / whereas
the (optional) agent is reflected in the complement by him.
The examples just quoted demonstrate that in English the verb ismorphologically different in the active voice than in the passive. The
same is also the case in Latvian.",[132]
"Preposition vs. Postposition
Except for the ambiguous (i. e. in terms of linear order) semi-prepositions, the majority of Latvian prepositions really are preposited;
only two (dé) because of, for the sake of and labad on behalf of, for
the sake of) are postposited, and hence strictly speaking postpositions,
even though they are treated under the same heading as the prepositions.
Case Government
The genitive, accusative and marginally the dative can be governed
by prepositions in Latvian, whereas the locative — and, of course, thenominative and the vocative — cannot. Genetically speaking, the locative
has an “imbedded” postposition. As mentioned (p. 41 above) we do not
see the necessity of working with an instrumental case in Latvian because
of the merger of this case with the accusative in the singular, the dativein the plural.
Only two prepositions govern more than one case, namely pa
(accusative and dative) and uz (accusative and genitive). When governedby the accusative, pa has the following meanings: along, on; through;
during/in; by; with the dative it has a “distributive” meaning, cf. below.",[181]
"Note that the English construction in order to + infinitive is not
rendered with an infinitival construction in Latvian, only with lai + the
subjunctive, see p. £27 f.
The participle component of the passive infinitive is in the dativecase if a logical subject in the dative case is referred to. The same holds
true for general statements (with omission of the dative subject).
Examples:
Skolniekiem nav labi but apceltiem
It is not good for schoolchildren to be mobbed (made fun of);
-Nav labi but apceltamhbIt is not good (for anyone) to be mobbed.
With reference to a nominative subject, i. e. grammatical subject,however, the participle must also appear in the nominative case, e.g.
Skolnieki negrib but apcelti
Schoolchildren don’t like to be mobbed.
The rules for the choice of aspect are the same as with finite
forms, cf. p. 115 ff.",[143]
"AGREEMENT217B. Personal Pronouns of the 1st and 2nd Person
The personal pronouns of the Ist and 2nd persons (es /, més we,
tu you (thou), jus you) are also gender differentiating: for example, es
esmu dzirdéjis (male) vs. dzirdéjusi (female) / have heard, jus esatdzirdéjuSi (male) vs. dziredéjusas (female) you have heard. If més and
jus refer to a group including both males and females, the unmarked
masc. gender has to be used.
For kas who, see section B, point g).
C. Indeclinable NounsThis point is devoted to indeclinable nouns. When the gender rules
given on p. 51 are observed, these nouns do not cause much trouble interms of agreement, e.g. jaunsauto a new car (agreement with theunmarked masc. gender). Observe, however, the case of proper names(geographical designations), e.g. gara Misisipi the long Mississippi
(river) where the noun is feminine through association with the feminine
common noun upe river. If the state of Mississipi is meant, masc.
agreement is encountered (due to the association with Stats state). Citiesshow feminine agreement, e.g. Oslo ir skaista (pilseta) Os/o is a beautiful city.
D. AbbreviationsFor abbreviations the guiding principle is agreement with the
grammatical head noun of the abbreviation, cf., for example: MLLVV
(= Miisdienu LatvieSu Literaras Valodas Gramatika) ir diezgan Sielathe MLLVG-grammar is rather big.
In some cases associative (or near to associative) agreement (cf.
pointc)isalsofound.","[213, 214]"
