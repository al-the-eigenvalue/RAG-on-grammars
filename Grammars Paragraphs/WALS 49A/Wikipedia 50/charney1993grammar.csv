(elicited) sentences as well, I have chosen to label it a topic marker,
as it can clearly be used to focus on what the speaker appears to
choose as the most important element of the sentence. [¢ is always
found on the first constituent, of the sentence. In at least one, and
possibly two constructions (the presentative and the comparative),
-tsa has-a predicative function (see sections 9.4 and 8.2.9).
A_second sentence marker, -se, functions much as -tsa does in
marking and highlighting information? In narrative it is employed
in subsequent senlences after the topic has been introduced in a
beginning sentence by -tsa, Like -tsa, the marker -se occurs on the
first constituent of the sentence. In isolated sentences it is seemingly interchangeable with -tsa (or with no sentence marker).
Armagost argues convincingly that, within narrative, -se is used to
signal contrast (i.e., a change of participants, referents, or scenes), 1
agree, and use his designation, with the caveat that this function is
not apparent in isolated sentences. Good examples of contrast are
found in (1) and (2)sentences, and a device for setting the stage in narrative,’ His anal-In many sentences, the topic of the narrative is marked by -tsa,

Some nouns may be inalienably possessed. Such nouns are
names for body parts, kin terms, and the word for a possessed horse
(puku). This area of Comanche morphology is difficult to ascertain,
as the speakers I have worked with are able to produce words with‘out possessive morphology during elicitation sessions. However, the
above terms are always found with possessive pronouns in texts.
Joseph Casagrande relates one way in which new nouns are
created in Comanche:3.1. Nominalpound, incorporated, or followed by a postposition. A rich system of
postpositions is used to express a number of locative and other
adverbial notions. A number of suffixes are used to nominalize

in the Great Basin. The relationships among the Numic languages1.1.of the two groups occurred before 1850.
Today the languages spoken by the two groups, although quite
similar, are best thought of as two separate languages, rather than
as dialects of the same language. That statement is based on
observations of differences between the phonology and syntax of the
languages. (The reader can observe a number of the phonological
differences by a careful reading of chapter 2. Differences in syntax

GRAMMARWord orderTwo conflicting factors affect word order: the basic SUBJECT
OBJECT VERB order of the language and the tendency to move the
subject into sentential second position,
The basic order for intransitive sentences is SUBJECT VERB, As
discussed above, the subject, when followed by -tsa or -se, is in first
position (SUBJECT VERB). There is a strong tendency in Comanche
for the subject to be moved into sentential second position (i.e., following the first constituent). The first constituent can be as lengthy
as an adverbial phrase but is generally one lexical item. If no other
elements are present, and if it is not suffixed by -tsa or ~se, the subject is moved into second position, resulting in the order VERE SUBJECT, If another element such as an adverb is initial in the sentence,
the subject occurs in second position and the verb is in final position, resulting in SUBJECT VERB word order.
In transitive sentences with full nouns, the basic word order is
SUBJECT OBJECT VERB, However, because subject pronouns regularly
are moved into sentential second position if they are not emphasized by -tsa or ~se, the resulting order is OBJECT SUBJECT VERB for8.2.2.the use of switch-reference suffixes (see section g.2), The markers

floshThe Shoshone preaspirated series remains in Comanche, though
in both languages forms with an aspirating final feature are rare.
These forms either surface as voiceless fricatives ({6] and [R]}) or
trigger voicelessness of preceding short, unstressed vowels ({Vt],
{Vk}, [Vkw], [Vts], [VR], [Vo]), thus remaining distinct from the
preaspirating series with p and with t after nonfront vowels. Ina
handful of forms the aspirated consonant appears as [hy] or [hr]
rather than either [b] or [R) because it occurs in a stressed or initial
syllable.
It has not been possible to cite Shoshone cognates as seen in theCOMANCHESHOSHONEThe Shoshone geminated stops are equivalent to the preaspirated stops in Comanche, so that Shoshone CC has a Comanche AC

it ‘generic aspect’. When it occurs as final aspect, -ti= basically has
a progressive meaning. It is related—at, least historically—to
homophonous forms used as a predicator and as a nominalizer (sections 8.2.3 and g.1.6), and to the -ti= found with the personal pronouns (section 4.1), the demonstratives (section 3.3), the postpositions (section 3.2), and some of the interrogative/indefinite pronouns (section 4.7) as well as with the colors (section 6.3) and

difference in meaning or context. One may end the sentence with
haame (‘to say yes’) (hda-me) (yes-QUOT/say) or with hai, The
latter is probably a form of the question particle ha; I have not
identified the i and there ia no nasalization, as there would be with
haa ‘yes’. As noted above, haame may slso be used in yes-no
questions, With both hai and haame there is a pause before the tag,

by Comanche people with whom I spoke (including many nonComanche speakers) is “isn't it?” For instance, one often hears
sentences such aa “She's pretty, isn't it?” or “They're busy, isn’t it?”",[223]
