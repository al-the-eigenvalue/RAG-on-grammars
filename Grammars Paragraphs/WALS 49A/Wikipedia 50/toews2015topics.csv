onThe third person singular pronoun à also functions as the definite particle.24 I will talk
about this more in 2.3.3.5 when I look at definiteness.
Notice that the second and third person pronouns have the same segmental form, but
different tone melodies. This is true for both the singular (á, à) and plural pronouns (yíi, yì).
Also, the singular and plural first person pronouns have the same segmental form but different
tone melodies (ń, n̂ ).2523The pronoun yíi is sometimes shortened to yí.
I am not sure of the syntactic status of the definite particle à, which is why I call it a definite particle rather than a
definite article. See Elbourne (2005) for a discussion of pronouns that have the semantics of definite determiners.
25
In other Kru languages, it is usually the first and second person pronouns that have the same segmental form, as in
Vata where the first and second person singular pronouns are n̍ and ǹ and the first and second person plural
pronouns are à and á (Marchese 1983:161).
24412.3.3.2 Bare Nouns: N
The simplest DP is a bare noun (36). The most salient interpretation for a bare noun is singular
and indefinite. However, bare nouns are usually number neutral, which means that they may be
interpreted as plural in certain contexts, as I discuss below when I talk about pluralization.

"Unlike the /tuw/ case, this morpheme has exactly the same distribution no matter which meaning
it receives, which can be seen in the phrases in (18). Moreover, it is possible to show that the
different functions of this morpheme are semantically related to each other.
The abstract meaning analysis states that the morpheme 's simply indicates that some
unspecified relation exists between two entities (Kay and Zimmer 1990, also see Partee and
Borschev 1998, 1999). The only way to determine the nature of this relation is to rely on context.
For example, the phrase in (19) could have any of the meanings listed in (19a-e).

a blanket I inherited from my grandmaSuppose I were to visit my mother-in-law and found that she had started on a new quilt using my
grandma's pattern. I might say to her, Oh, you're making my grandma's blanket! In that case, the
meaning would have to be the one in (19d). Or, suppose a friend came to stay with me for a
week, and needed some bedding to use. I have a big supply of blankets in the back closet, but
one of them is reserved for my grandma, so I tell her, You can use any of these blankets except
that one- it's my grandma's blanket. In that case, the meaning would be the one in (19c).
Higginbotham (1983) formalizes this theory as follows: A genitive phrase is represented
as in (20a), where NP1 is the genitive-marked noun phrase214 and N' is the thing that is possessed.
The meaning of 's is expanded in (20b), which states that for the unique entity, x, x is N' and x is
in some relation (R) to NP1 (from Higginbotham (1983:397–398). If the specific NP in question
is my grandma's blanket (20c), and the context is the one from (19d), then the representation in
(20b) can be filled out as in (20d).",[300]
"Each level of this tree is discussed in the following subsections, along with a few other topics
that are not part of the tree. The first section is about pronouns (2.3.3.1). Subsequent sections

possessives (2.3.3.6), and nominalized verbs (2.3.3.7).
2.3.3.1 Pronouns
There are two sets of pronouns. I am calling one set the emphatic pronouns (Table 2.21), and the
other set regular pronouns (Table 2.22; following Thiessen (2005)), but I do not know the rules
that govern the choice of one type of pronoun over the other. The regular pronouns are usually a
shortened version of the emphatic pronouns.

"Present Imperfective217Although the usual pattern is for imperfective utterances like (24a) to have a present time reference and
imperfective + ín utterances like (24b) to have past time reference, it is possible for imperfective utterances without

The French translation does not match the context: the pronoun is feminine, but the context is about a brother.
This is because the context is from one elicitation session, and the translation is from another when I was doing a
grammaticality check. Siamou pronouns do not have gender distinctions.

COP2.3.3.6 Possessor: Poss (ǹ) NP
I assume for now that possessors in Siamou are complements of NP.33 All the data is of
definite possessed nouns, which appear to be more common than indefinite possessed nouns.
Definite possessed nouns occur with the definite enclitic, as in (48) but not with the definite
particle, à (49). Inalienable possession (relations and body parts) is marked by the possessor
followed by the possessed noun.
48.",[68]
"125The verbs in (Table 3.37k-n) all have a coda r while none of the other verbs in this table do. In these verbs (but
not the others), /i/ is pronounced [ɪ], and this is likely related to the fact that they pattern differenctly in the
perfective and imperfective forms (Paul Thiessen p.c).
126
The verb form dénno is unusual. It often acts as the perfective of the verb don (go). However, the actual (regular)
perfective of don is dòn. There are rules governing the use of dòn versus dénno which I am not very familiar with.
However, the first form occurs more in negative clauses and the latter occurs more in affirmative clauses. The verb
form dénno patterns differently in the grammar as well. For example, dénno can occur with the non-finite particle ki,
which no other perfective can do, suggesting that it is probably not a perfective, although it functions as one in many
cases. It is possible that dénno is multi-morphemic. Siamou has a suffix -no which means something like 'go', and
this suffix can attach to some other bare verbs. I am not sure what the dén would be in that case.
Throughout this thesis, I have glossed dénno as go.PRFV?. The ? indicates that I am not sure of its status.",[188]
"He has been thinking.
* He is thinking-edIf we only looked at (64b), we might conclude that English does not allow aspect
stacking either, but that is clearly not true (see Cinque 1999). It just does not allow stacking on
the same verb. There is some evidence that this may be the case in Siamou as well. The utterance
in (65) expresses both prospective aspect and imperfective aspect. In order to accommodate both,
the utterance uses the verb tɛŋn ('be/become') with prospective aspect morphology. Imperfective
aspect is marked with an imperfective nominal táaŋn that is the subject of the verb.
65.",[167]
"4.4.1.4 Perfective Aspect Combines with Past Tense
The final test to show that a morpheme is not past tense is whether or not it can combine with
past morphology. This test is stronger than the previous two. First of all, if other past
morphology exists in the language, the role of past tense marker may already be taken, which
means the morpheme in question is likely not past tense.141 Secondly, we would not expect the
past tense to be marked twice by two distinct morphemes in one utterance. If one morpheme is
already marking past, the other one is likely doing something else.
4.4.1.5 Perfective Aspect Does Not Combine with Imperfective
If a grammatical morpheme is a perfective aspect, it is expected that it can not combine with
imperfective morphology.142 Perfectives and imperfectives are expected to be in complementary
distribution because by definition, an utterance cannot have both perfective and imperfective
aspect.143141I am not saying that languages cannot have more than one past tense morpheme. Many Niger-Congo languages
make distinctions between different degrees of pastness, such as remote past and recent past (Nurse 2008). In the
absence of such a contrast, we only expect one past tense marker.
142
The past morpheme, in contrast, can co-occur with the imperfective, as I show in 4.6.2.4.
143
Although see Comrie 1976:31–32 for one case where two aspectual categories labeled perfective and
imperfective do co-occur.",[216]

food eat-STAT
He ate (food).
French: Il a mangé de la nourriture. (C)There are two main ways to derive this: for Kayne (1994), it must be the case that Siamou has an
underlying head-initial (VO) word order. In this case the aspect head precedes the verb phrase
(Asp VP) and the verb has to raise and adjoin to the aspect head in order to derive the surface
(VP Asp) order, as shown in (33a). The object must also raise to a higher position (called Spec
AgrOP) in order to derive the surface (OV Asp) ordering (see Pollock 1989 and Roberts 1997).
The second possibility, which Kayne (1994) would reject, is that Siamou has an
underlying head-final (OV) word order. In this case, the aspect head follows the verb and can
attach to it via right-alignment (V Asp). This is shown in (33b).
33.a.b.",[149]
"144At this point there is no strong evidence to argue that this is a case of stacking because
the segmental form of the verb root of completive and stative verbs resembles the bare verb more
than it resembles the perfective. I conclude that there appears to be no stacking of aspectual
suffixes on the verb. In the next section I consider the possibility that aspect can stack in another
way.
3.3.2.4 A (Possible) Argument from Auxiliation
Languages sometimes use auxiliary verbs to allow more than one kind of aspect in a clause. For
example, in English, the auxiliary have (+past participle) introduces perfect aspect and the
auxiliary be (+present participle) introduces progressive aspect. These aspects can stack, as
shown with the perfect progressive sentence in (64a). However, it is not possible for these
aspects to stack on the same verb, as evidenced by the utterance in (64b) which attempts to stack
the past and present participial forms of the verb think.

"152the segmental form of the verb stem in those languages: the only difference between them is
tone. In Table 3.25 above, the imperfective also had the same segmental form as the verb stem
(or the same as the perfective in the cases where the verb stem is not explicitly stated). However,
those imperfectives are the exception rather than the norm. Usually, Kru imperfectives are
marked segmentally, and not just tonally.
3.4.3.2 Imperfective Usually Has a Segmental Form
Kru languages have two main morphological strategies for marking imperfectives. The
most common type is a verbal suffix (74a), and the less common type is a suffix on the subject
(74b).

"Abstract MeaningThe first possibility (homophony, (111a)) is that ín marks past tense, and also politeness and
doubt, but there is no connection between them. This is very unlikely. It is very common for past
tense to mark politeness and irrealis-type things (such as doubt) in many languages (see
Fleischman 1989, Klein 1994). Since this is not unique to Siamou, it is likely not an accident,
and we would prefer to find a connection between the two sets of meanings.
The second possibility (polysemy, 111b) is that the meanings are distinct, but that there is
some link between them. Fleischman (1989) frames the connection between them as a metaphor.
She suggests that just like the past tense distances us from the present, doubt distances us from
reality, and politeness distances us from the situation in a way that places less obligation on the
listener. However, if we adopted this analysis for Siamou, we would expect that it would have
either one reading (past tense) or the other (politeness or doubt). Since it can mark past tense and
doubt simultaneously, this explanation does not work (although the insight that temporal distance
can be a metaphor for social distance is interesting and useful).
Conversational implicature (111c) was explored above.
The fourth possibility, abstract meaning (111d), also makes use of the concept of
distancing. In this theory, ín has the function of taking a central point on a scale and giving as its
322value a displacement from that central point. The scale is not specified, which is how the
meaning comes to be more abstract than just past tense. It can be temporal, in which case the
central point (T0) is the present, and ín marks past tense (T0-1). The scale can be modal, in
which case the central point is the real world and ín marks an event as being some distance from
the real world, which is what causes it to be interpreted as doubt. The scale can also refer to the
speaker's investment in the situation, in which case ín marks politeness. If the scale is temporal,
T0 represents the speech time (the present), and then the function of ín is to place the reference
time of an utterance at some point preceding T0, which is past tense. If T0 is the present, then
T0-1 is the past. This is shown in the diagram in (112). (See Fleischman (1989) for discussion.)

""modulated"" tone. Here I have labeled it M!HL, since that seems to be the most common of the
modulated tones. However, this ""group"" actually encompasses a number of different complex
contour tones, but a rising-falling tone is the most common (Nicolson p.c). There are very few
nouns (2.8%, 15/538) and even fewer verbs (1.1%, 3/268) in this category. Many of them are
borrowed.

Words with M, M(L), and M(!H) tone melodies all surface as M in many contexts. This
means that in these contexts, the difference between these tone melodies is neutralized, and it is
impossible to differentiate between them (Thiessen 2005). One such context is uninflected verbs,
which are used in imperatives. The examples below show pairs of uninflected verbs that belong
to different tone melody groups, but which are indistinguishable in the given context: they all
bear a M tone. In (18), the verb gbal ('separate') is homophonous with the verb gbal ('unearth'),
even though the first one belongs to the M tone melody group and the second belongs to the
M(!H) tone melody group. Similarly, in (19), kyaŋ ('help'), which is part of the M group is
homophonous with kyaŋ ('scratch'), which is part of the M(L) group. In (20), fli ('survive',
M(!H)) and fli ('open', M(L)) are also homophonous in the imperative.

Other similarities between Siamou and other Kru languages include a number of grammatical
morphemes that appear to be cognates (such as the negative particle bo in Siamou and the
negative particle be in Grebo), and word order, both in the verbal and nominal domains. Person
(1966) also gives a historical explanation for the geographical distance between Siamou and the
other Kru languages, arguing that Kru languages were originally spoken further north than they
are now, in Ivory Coast and Liberia, until the Mandé and the Maninka pushed them out. Most of
them moved south, except for the Siamou, who fled north into Burkina Faso (Person 1966).

from the other dialects mainly in phonetics and phonology. He systematically works through the
possible sound combinations and syllable structures. He discusses how words borrowed from
Jula are changed to fit Siamou phonology (usually by changing three-syllable words into two60Plawi (or Plaoui) is spoken in Ivory Coast (Person 1966). Marchese (1983:115) lists it as a Grebo dialect.","[100, 101]"

"IMPF: MAgain, these facts match the Siamou pattern: when the perfective is marked, it is marked
by a low tone, whereas the imperfective is marked by a mid tone (and a nasal).
For the perfective, low tone is the only overt phonological marker there is in Kru. For the
imperfective, on the other hand, tone marking usually occurs in conjunction with segmental
content, which I now discuss.
3.4.3 The Segmental Form of Aspectual Inflection: Siamou Converges with Kru
I turn now to the segmental form and show that a typical Kru perfective, when it is marked, is
marked exclusively with tone. The imperfective, on the other hand, although it usually bears mid
tone, also has segmental marking in most cases.
3.4.3.1 Perfective Usually Lacks a Segmental Form
Table 3.26 above showed the tonal differences between the verb stem and the perfective
in a number of languages. It also showed that the segmental form of the perfective is the same as
114A HM contour is marked in (71b) with two stacked tones on the same vowel (kū ́ ). This is different than in the
Siamou orthography where it would be written with a vowel with H tone marking followed by an unmarked vowel,
as follows: kúu.",[174]
"Abstract Meaning (There is one meaning that is abstract enough to include all the
seemingly distinct meanings.)6.2.1 Accidental Homophony Hypothesis
Accidental homophony means that each instance of a multi-functional morpheme with its
particular meaning is distinct, and it is merely a coincidence that they all have the same
phonological form.
For example, in English, the form /tuw/ has a number of meanings, including a numeral
(two), an additive particle (too) and a preposition (to). There is no clear link between these
meanings. They have different spellings which reflect distinct origins. These morphemes also
have very different syntactic distributions. The numeral (two) modifies nouns, which the other

The factative is extremely pervasive in Kru languages (Marchese 1986). They may have
unmarked factatives, as in Dewoin (65), or marked factatives, as in Vata (66). Often if it is
marked, it is marked by a low tone suffix on the verb (66).

"269I am not sure if futures of any kind ever actually entail that an event is realized though. This would mean that
speakers have to know the future. What is important, I think, is whether or not the speakers believe the event will be
realized. In (34), supposedly the monkey actually intends to bite. With futures-in-the-past, as in (35), it is quite
common for the event not to be realized (Iatridou 2000).
270
See 7.3.3 for a brief discussion of why this diagnostic might be problematic. The diagnostics for future
expressions are now such that they almost rule out future tense altogether. This is interesting because maybe it says
something important about language: that there's no such thing as future tense at all. If that is the case, what is the
significance of that? Alternatively, perhaps we have just restricted the definition of future tense so much as to make
it useless. As Enç (1996) points out, if we define tense too strictly, we end up ruling it out altogether. In that case,
maybe we need to re-evaluate our criteria for future tense.",[366]

In this section I show that -n marks verbs as having an event time that extends past the
boundaries of the reference time, which is the definition of imperfective.
The following examples show that the verbs inflected with the -n suffix are understood to
begin at some point before the beginning of the time denoted by the temporal phrase and end at
some point after the end of that time. In this case, the temporal phrase is an adverbial. In the
imperfective examples below, the event is not contained in the reference time.

toIn this case, the perfective marked verb in (33a) has a stative interpretation ('I'm hungry') while
the imperfective marked verb in (33b) has an inchoative interpretation ('I started to get hungry').
This is expected for this type of verb because inchoative verbs consistently have an inchoative
interpretation when they are inflected for imperfective aspect. (See 5.2.2.10.) I would also expect
that the perfective phrase in (32a) could have a past inchoative interpretation depending on the
context. This remains to be determined.

unmarked, so the low tone (part of the mid-low contour) is not a marker of the perfective in this

"1944.4.1.6 Perfective Has Event Time Contained in Temporal Boundary of Adverbial Modifier
The remaining three tests (4.3.1.6-4.3.1.8) involve determining whether or not a morpheme
marks events as having an initial point, a final point or both (Klein's (1994) three types of
perfectives). One test is to show that an event has both an initial and a final point within the
reference time, the second shows an utterance to have a final point within the reference time,
without giving any information on whether or not it has an initial point, and the third shows an
utterance to lack a final point within the reference time. The third test has been used as a test for
initial points (Bar-el 2005), but I argue that it makes more sense to use it as a test for final points.
Without a dedicated initial point test, I find no way to conclusively determine if Klein's (1994)
second type of perfective exists (the one with a final point but no initial point, shown in (16b)).
The same morpheme can potentially mark all three types of perfective, depending on
factors such as context or the event type of the verb. This means, for example, that just because a
test shows a morpheme to have a final point in one context does not mean it has a final point in
all contexts. However, if a morpheme marks one or more of Klein's (1994) three types of
perfective, calling that morpheme perfective is warranted.
In the next few paragraphs I give a summary of the initial/final point tests. The third test,
the inceptive reading test, is the most controversial, so I spend extra time discussing it.
The first of these tests is a test for initial and final points. Its purpose is to show that in at
least some cases (and probably in most cases) utterances marked with this morpheme are
characterized by having an event time that is completely contained within a reference time,
which is a perfective with an initial and a final point (shown in 16c). I look at utterances with
temporal adverbial phrases that mark the reference time and show that an event described by a
verb inflected with this morpheme is understood to occur completely within the time frame given
by the adverbial phrase. For example, in the sentence She painted the house purple while I
watched, the temporal phrase while I watched provides the reference time. English speakers
understand the event painting the house purple to be completely contained within the time frame
of the period defined by the phrase while I watched. That is to say, the whole event of painting
was completed while I watched. If the Siamou morpheme in question has this property, it must
be a perfective (in both Kratzer's (1998) and Klein's (1994) theories).","[216, 217]"
"In this case, the modal base contains propositions that have to do with real-world facts: for
example, I am a graduate student. Graduate students write dissertations in order to graduate.
Finishing a dissertation requires working on it. These facts are all consistent with each other. The
ordering source in this case consists of the set of propositions expressed by the phrase what I
want. I have two relevant desires: I want to finish my dissertation, but I also want to never work
on it. The propositions in the modal base (the facts about the world) are not inconsistent with
each other. Nor are my desires inconsistent with each other. It is only when we try to combine
the worlds picked out by the modal base (i.e. the factual worlds) with the worlds picked out by
the ordering source (i.e. the worlds in which I get what I want) that we encounter inconsistencies.
Unfortunately, there are no worlds in which I can have everything I want because the world is260If there is a non-empty modal base, the ordering source ranks a subset of the worlds picked out by the modal

alwaysTo summarize, Siamou has some properties consistent with SOV languages, including
SOV word order, complement-head ordering of lexical heads and some functional heads, and a
preference for suffixes over prefixes. It also has a few properties consistent with SVO languages,
including head-complement ordering of some functional heads, and modifiers that follow their
heads. See 3.2.2.1 for more discussion of SOV and SVO properties.
Kayne (1994) would lead us to predict that all of the above structures that are head-initial
are un-derived, and all the ones that are head-final are derived by leftward movement. In the next
section, I look for independent evidence of leftward movement in Siamou.
3.2.1.3 Is There Evidence for Leftward Movement in Siamou?
This section explores three situations where movement commonly occurs cross-linguistically:
wh-questions, relative clauses and the formation of passives. (See Adger 2003.) Although this is
not the same type of movement as the verb-raising in anti-symmetry, we might expect that if a
language uses movement as a common strategy, it would be more likely to use movement to
derive its surface SOV word order. It turns out that Siamou does not use movement as a strategy
in wh-questions (3.2.1.3.1) or relative clauses (3.2.1.3.2), but it does in passives (3.2.1.3.3).
3.2.1.3.1 Wh-movement in Siamou? No
In many languages, wh-words raise to a higher position, leaving behind a trace (28a). Siamou,
however, has wh-words in situ (28b). Raising is ungrammatical (28c). Instead, an utterance like
(28c), without the trace, has a different interpretation, since the subject and object have inverted.

"271In this case, a word has one meaning that is so abstract that it can include all of its seemingly
distinct uses. Only context and other extra-linguistic factors determine which particular meaning
is employed. These possibilities are not mutually exclusive. It could be, for example, that the
meaning of ín is abstract enough to include some but not all of the meanings listed above, and
the rest are conversational implicatures.
The four possible ways of analyzing the meanings of ín that I discussed above can be
diagrammed as in (8): Homophony (8a) is represented by individual circles, one for each
meaning, and no link between them. The letters inside indicate different meanings. Polysemy
(8b) is represented by individual circles with lines linking them. Conversational implicature (8c)
has one basic meaning (a) in a circle surrounded by a larger, hazy circle that represents the
additional, unstated meaning. Abstract meaning (8d) is represented by one large circle labeled D.

E-S-RReichenbach's (1947) theory only has room for three R/E relations (which Klein (1994)
calls aspect): perfect, prospective and ""simple."" Klein (1994) introduces more fine-grained
aspectual distinctions by allowing R and E to overlap in more than one way. This means that the
aspect relation shown in Table 4.6a-c (i.e. R , E) is ambiguous. It includes both perfective and
imperfective aspect. These aspects are discussed in great detail in 4.2.
Klein (1994) lists all the logically possible kinds of tense and aspect allowed by his
theory. However, there is cross-linguistic variability in the ways that languages grammaticalize174tense and aspect. First of all, languages may combine more than one category. For example,
Matthewson (2006) argues that St'át'imcets has a covert morpheme that is indeterminate between
a past tense and a present tense reading. It simply specifies ""non-future."" Secondly, languages
may not necessarily mark all the potential tense or aspect contrasts. In such cases, a particular
tense or aspect construal may arise by default.128
The definition of aspect given in this section is sometimes called grammatical aspect to
distinguish it from lexical aspect. Furthermore, Liao (2005) argues that grammatical aspect can
be split into two kinds: temporal aspect, which includes perfect and prospective aspect, and
viewpoint aspect, which includes perfective and imperfective aspect (see 3.3.1 for more
information). In the next section I look first at grammatical aspect in more detail, and then at
lexical aspect and its interaction with grammatical aspect in 4.3.","[196, 197]"

The M(L) tone group contains syllables that are M tone in most contexts, which means that they
are indistinguishable from the M tone group. However, in some contexts the M(L) tone melody
surfaces as L tone (see 2.2.2, see also Déchaine 1993 for discussion of ambitonal tone classes in
Igbo). This group has many verbs (19.8%, 53/268), but very few nouns (4.1%, 22/538).

moderate number of nouns (11.1%, 60/538) and verbs (10.8%, 29/268).","[49, 50]"
"This suggests that the completive with ín parallels the perfective with ín, but I do not
have enough data to present a complete analysis at this time. It is possible that the default past
interpretation of the completive aspect is also cancelable in certain contexts, In that case, we
would expect that ín would also shift such utterances to the past.
To summarize, I have shown that ín can mark past tense in combination with all
grammatical aspect categories, as well as with non-verbal predicates. Since ín always marks past
tense, I conclude that this is its primary meaning. In the next section, I look at the remaining
meanings of ín.",[327]

3.2.2.3 The Structure of Aspect in Siamou Following Kru (Koopman 1984, Marchese 1986)
It appears that Siamou is even more strongly SOV than other Kru languages. Not only does it
have exclusive SOV word order, it also does not have some SVO characteristics that the other
Kru languages have. If Kru is underlyingly SOV, as argued by Koopman (1984) and Marchese
(1986), then Siamou would certainly be underlyingly SOV. According to this argumentation, the
best representation of aspect is not (54a), as Kayne's (1994) theory of anti-symmetry would
require, but (54b) in which the verb phrase is head final, and aspect adjoins to the right edge of
the verb phrase. In this case, no movement is required because this is exactly the surface order.

M(!H) and M(L), another context distinguishes M(!H) from M and M(L), and a third context
distinguishes M(L) from M and M(!H). Below, I discuss three contexts that allow us to
differentiate verbs that belong to these groups, and two contexts that allow us to differentiate
nouns that belong to these groups.
For verbs, inflected forms serve as diagnostic contexts. Verbs inflected with the HL tone
prospective aspect 2 suffix -bɛ̂ serve to distinguish M verbs from the other two. Verbs inflected
with the M tone imperfective suffix -n (or the prospective aspect 1 suffix -a) distinguish M(!H)
verbs from the other two. And verbs inflected with the L tone perfective suffix -L (or the low
tone stative suffix -ɲɛ̀n, or the low tone completive suffix -è) show that M(L) verbs are distinct
from the other two (Thiessen 2005). This is summarized in Table 2.18.

M(!H) group patterns differently than the other two (Thiessen 2005). For nouns, I am not aware
of a context in which M(L) patterns differently than the other two. However, the M(L) group is
differentiated in this case because it behaves like a M(!H) noun in context 1 and like a M noun in
context 2. Table 2.19 summarizes these details.

(which is only available for verbs, according to what is currently known) is useful to show that

melody group.
First I look at the three contexts for verbs. The first context is shown in (22). When
inflected with the HL tone prospective aspect 2 suffix -bɛ̂, M verbs have a M-L tone melody
(22a), while M(!H) verbs and M(L) verbs have a M-!HL tone melody (22b-c). The surface tones

In this notation, e stands for event and P for predicate. The λ is a notational tool that
serves to introduce a variable (here, an event). States are bare predicates. Activities are
predicates under the scope of the operator DO. Achievements are predicates under the scope of
the operator BECOME, and accomplishments are predicates that are composed of two sub-events.
The first sub-event predicate is under the scope of a DO operator and the second is under the
scope of a CULMINATE (CUL) operator.
The operator DO marks the predicate as being under the control of an agent (Dowty
1979:118). The operator BECOME marks a predicate as going from not being the case to being the
case. This is written formally in (29a), and diagrammed in (29b). BECOME φ is true at an interval

This section focuses on Siamou syntax, and in particular on head-complement ordering. I
approach this topic from two angles. In 3.2.1, I look at Siamou through a particular theory of
syntax, called anti-symmetry, which proposes that all languages have the same underlying
structure in which heads always precede their complements (Kayne 1994). In 3.2.2 I look at
Siamou as a member of the Kru language family, which often has (surface) complement-head
ordering (Koopman 1984). In anti-symmetry theory, Siamou is assumed to be underlyingly headinitial, like all other languages. As a Kru language, however, and disregarding anti-symmetry,
Siamou is predominantly head-final, which is the structure I adopt.
3.2.1 Siamou and Kayne's Conjecture
This section has three subparts. Section 3.2.1.1 briefly explains the theory of anti-symmetry.
Section 3.2.1.2 shows that Siamou has consistent surface SOV (i.e. complement-head) word
order. In anti-symmetry theory, Siamou's SOV word order must be derived by raising. In this
case, we might expect to find other instances of raising in Siamou syntax. I look for evidence this
in 3.2.1.3, with mixed results. Finally, 3.2.1.4 presents two possible structures of the Siamou
aspect phrase, and shows which one Kayne's (1994) theory predicts to be correct.
3.2.1.1 Kayne (1994) Predicts Consistent VO
Kayne's (1994) theory of anti-symmetry predicts that phrases universally have the order headcomplement, as shown in (18a). A complement-head ordering that does not involve movement is
ungrammatical (18b). Instead, a structure in which a complement precedes its head must be
derived (18c).93

My goal in the next chapter is to establish the truth and felicity conditions for two Siamoumorphemes: the low tone suffix that I have been calling perfective aspect, and the -n suffix that I
hav been calling imperfective aspect, and to see how closely they match commonly accepted
truth and felicity conditions for perfectives and imperfectives. In a language, when a certain
phonological form regularly occurs in an utterance in conjunction with a consistent meaning or
set of meanings, we associate that form with the meaning(s) accompanying it. We like to give the
form some kind of name or label to identify it. Since similar sets of meanings occur in many
different languages, if the interpretation of a particular form in one language is similar to one that
occurs in one or more other languages, it is useful, for the sake of cross-linguistic comparison, to
give them the same name. Therefore, I will test whether or not the Siamou low tone suffix fits
the general definition for perfective aspect, and whether or not the Siamou -n suffix fits the
general definition for imperfective aspect. I will also determine how closely the meanings
associated with these forms match meanings associated with other forms with the same label in
other languages. If the Siamou forms have meanings similar to forms in other languages that are
called perfective or imperfective, it is sensible to give the Siamou forms the same name. This is
not to say they are equivalent, but they have some basic features in common.
In order to reach the goal of establishing truth and felicity conditions, we need a way of
formalizing concepts so that a language can be examined systematically. This is the purpose of a
theoretical framework. It provides a vocabulary and allows us to define the terms perfective and
imperfective. Using these definitions, we can make predictions about the behaviour of these
forms, and then test these predictions by eliciting utterances, along with truth and felicity
judgments, from native speakers of a language. These tests are called diagnostics. Over the next
few pages, I discuss the theoretical framework that I adopt for my analysis of the Siamou verb
forms that correspond to the perfective and imperfective.
Perfective and imperfective aspect both belong to the category of grammatical aspect.
However, their deployment is sensitive to the lexical properties of the verbs that they combine
177with. Therefore, in order to understand the perfective and imperfective, which are instances of
grammatical aspect, we need to consider how lexical aspect interacts with grammatical aspect. In
the following two subsections, I look first at two theories of grammatical aspect (4.2.1) and then
at lexical aspect (4.2.2).
4.2.1 Theory 1: Event Time Fully Contained in Reference Time (Kratzer 1998)
This section explores two theories of grammatical aspect—from now on simply aspect— that are
very closely related, but different. The first is from Kratzer (1998) (4.2.1.1) and the second from
Klein (1994) (4.2.1.2). I show that while Klein and Kratzer have the same definition for
imperfective aspect, Klein's definition of perfective aspect is slightly broader than Kratzer's
(4.2.1.3), and I discuss the implications of adopting the second type of perfective.
For Kratzer (1998), perfective aspect arises when the event time is contained within the
reference time (time(e) ⊆ time(r)). Imperfective aspect arises when the reference time is
contained within the event time (or, in other words, the event time extends past the boundaries of
the reference time) (time(r) ⊆ time(e)). These two definitions are formalized in (12) below, from
Kratzer (1998:17).

Klein's three perfectives is not possible in Dëne Sųɬiné: the one in which the event time extends
past the end of the reference time.

"Therefore, if the noun is modified, the plural marking attaches to the adjective phrase (40a-b),
not the noun (40c). If the adjective is distributive (i.e. applying to each child individually), it is
reduplicated, as in (40b).
