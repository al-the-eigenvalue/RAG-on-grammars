"27.4Verb-finalcharacteristicsofSlaveAs discussed above, Slave has SOV word order. Greenberg (1963) discussed a number of characteristics of languages with different word orders. While Slave is typically verb-final based on Greenberg's criteria, it
differs from Greenberg's 'typical' verb-final language in some ways.
Slave shares the following characteristics with verb-final languages:
1. It is postpositional.
2. In postpositional langauges, the genitive precedes the
noun. This is true in Slave, as shown by the example in (22).
(22) Mary beno
3.mother'Mary'sgoverningmother'3. In SOV dominant languages, adverbial modifiers tend to precede the
verb. This is the case in Slave.
4. Determiners usually precede the noun in verb-final languages. They
do in Slave.
Slave differs from the verb final languages considered by Greenberg in
a number of ways.
1. In languages with postpositions, question particles are generally
sentence-final. The Slave question particle is sentence-initial.
2. In verb-final languages, adjectives normally precede the noun.
While Slave does not have real adjectives, adjectival type elements, the
lexical modifiers, follow the noun.
3. Relative clauses tend to precede the head noun in verb-final languages while in Slave they follow the head noun.
While Slave is clearly an SOV language, it does not have all the characteristics of a strict SOV language as generally characterized in the linguistics literature.",[1048]
"14.2UninflectedstemsA number of different stems can be used to modify nouns.
As
modifiers, these stems are never inflected for person or number. In many
cases, a dependent suffix -e, a suffix which never occurs in the inflected
form, is present when these stems function as qualifiers.
Many descriptive and dimensional verb theme category stems can be238Part III.","[281, 282]"
"30.6SummaryPossible coreference relations are determined in Slave by a rule of noncoreference, based on the notions of precedence and command, that designates when two noun phrases cannot refer to the same entity.
Apparent
anomalous sentences are accounted for by this rule if some postpositions
also occur in the category conjunction.
This chapter deals with one facet of coreference: that of assigning
possible coreference relations between nouns and pronouns. With the exception of anaphors, there are no cases in which nouns and pronouns must
be coreferential, while there are cases where they must be noncoreferential.
Other cases of coreference, anaphors (reflexive, reciprocal,
ye-),
where there must be an antecedent within the sentence, are discussed in
chapter 28. Cases where the interpretation of the subject of a complement
is controlled by the subject or object of the higher verb are discussed in
chapter 42.",[1091]
"986Part IV. The ModelWhen a constituent is moved, it leaves behind a trace in its base generated position. The moved constituent and the trace are coindexed.
The
trace is free in reference in its sentence, like the pronoun.
The constituents in topic position must have a reference somewhere in the sentence so that they can be interpreted: it and the coindexed trace are interpreted as having the same reference because they are coindexed.
Base generated noun phrases in topic and question complementizer positions are handled differently. These noun phrases must be linked to a
noun within the sentence to receive a reading. An interpretive rule does
this. Matching of features between the nouns within S and the noun in
topic or question complementizer positions filters out sentences where
there is no noun phrase within the sentence that can be interpreted as
coreferential to the dislocated noun. The dislocated noun is thus linked to
an argument position of the verb and is interpreted as coreferential to
that argument, taking on its grammatical and thematic roles.
26.4.2Interpreting grammatical relationsAs discussed in section 26.4.1, logical form is a projection from the lexicon. In the lexicon, each verb includes a subcategorization frame indicating transitivity. The grammatical relations of subject and object are defined from these subcategorization frames.
The subject of the sentence is the first NP immediately dominated by S
and the object is a noninitial NP immediately dominated by S. Subject and
object can thus be linearly defined. Oblique objects are NPS governed by
postpositions (or objects of verbs requiring oblique objects) and possessors are NPs governed by another noun.
Examples of these grammatical relations are shown in (163). Subjects
are labelled 1, direct objects 2, and oblique objects 3.

'John made Mary eat'
?
John Mary [ +3 shetj ] o l a
1 2
1The Model987Within each sentence, grammatical relations are defined. 'John' is the first
NP immediately dominated by S and is thus the subject. 'Mary' is the second NP immediately dominated by S and is the direct object. Within the
lower sentence, the pronoun is a subject.
These definitions also apply in sentences with nouns in topic and question complementizer position. In these cases, the dislocated noun is not
dominated by S, but by S' or S"". Therefore it does not get assigned a
grammatical relation directly.
Instead, it is interpreted as having the
grammatical relation of the noun to which it is linked by the rules discussed in section 26.4.1. (165) has a noun in topic position.

?s-[ NP[ ehkee ] s [li
1'the boy, the dog bit him' (Hr)
4 kayeyihshu ] ]
2In this sentence, 'dog' is the subject and the pronoun the direct object.
'Boy' is linked to the pronoun and gets interpreted as direct object.
Grammatical relations are assigned on the basis of full phrase markers
as projected from the lexicon.
26.4.3Thematic relations 31Every noun must be assigned a thematic relation (agent, theme, location,
goal, source, etc.). Thematic relations are assigned to nouns from the subcategorization frame of the verb in the lexicon.
Only nouns within a simplex sentence have thematic relations assigned
from the lexicon. Nouns in topic and question complementizer position receive thematic markings because they are linked with a noun within S,
thus receiving their thematic roles indirectly.
26.4.4Direct discourseThere is a small number of complement-taking verbs in Slave that take
what are usually called direct discourse complements. In the complement
sentence of these verbs, pronouns correspond not to forms used by the
speaker of the sentence but to forms used by the subject of the main
clause. In direct discourse, the point of view of interpretation of the complement is that of the subject of the main clause, not of the speaker.
Direct discourse verbs fail to take a complementizer. They also allow
long range dislocated nouns, both in topic and question complementizer
positions. These properties are discussed in chapter 45.
In logical form, a rule of direct discourse interpretation is needed to
interpret complement clause pronouns from the point of view of the
speaker of the matrix. Pronouns that are normally not coindexed must be
considered coreferential under direct discourse. This can be seen in (166).

b. sek'edutlasenihwhe
4il s g . a f t e r 3 opt.go 3 want lsg.
's/he wants me to go with him' (SI)
In (166a), the first person complement subject and the third person matrix subject must be interpreted as coreferential. In (166b), the complement subject is coreferential to the matrix object and the complement
oblique object to the matrix object.
Nouns that are marked coreferential in direct discourse do not share
features of person. Within the complement, the conditions discussed in
section 26.4.1 hold to determine coreference relationships.
Normal
conditions of coreference between sentences are suspended with direct
discourse verbs.
26.4.5ControlThere are some verbs in Slave that are control verbs: an argument of
the matrix must be coreferential to an argument of the complement
clause. There are subject control verbs, where the subject of the matrix
must serve as antecedent for an argument of the complement, generally
the subject, and object control verbs, where the object of the matrix must
serve as antecedent for an argument of the complement sentence. If the
controller noun and the subject complement do not agree in features and
thus cannot be marked as coreferential, the sentence is ungrammatical.
While verbs are marked as control verbs, the noun which acts as controller is determinable: a verb with an object assigns object control, one
without an object assigns subject control. Control is assigned as in (167).
(167) In the structure ΝΡχ S[ . . . NP2 . . .] V, where V is a control verb:
a. N P j is a controller if it is the NP closest to the verb.
b. Assign NP 2 the same index as the controller NP.
c. If such assignment is not possible, the sentence is ungrammatical.
Some examples of control verbs are shown in (168).

"24.17.2TheclassificatoryverbsAll the Athapaskan languages exhibit an alternation of verb themes that
is traditionally called classificatory. The classificatory themes describe the
nature of an object handled with respect to parameters such as extension
and dimension.
They restrict an action to certain classes of subject or
object.
The Athapaskan verb system has been discussed widely (for
example, Davidson, Elford, and Hoijer 1963, Garrison 1974, Carter 1976,
Witherspoon 1977).
The verb theme indicates the nature of the object handled while the
type of activity involved is expressed in the prefixes. In all cases, the
object delimited by the verb theme bears the thematic role relationship of
theme to the verb: it is the subject of an intransitive verb and the o b j e c t
of a transitive verb.
Davidson, Elford and Hoijer (1963), in a major description of the classificatory verb system, differentiate four sets of classificatory verbs, as in
(2).",[823]
"Syntaxplural. This can be seen in several examples given above: (145), (149),
and (152) through (159) with hi and (160) through (166) with hg. If one
of the conjuncts is first person, the inflectional pronoun must be first person plural; if one of the conjuncts is second person and the other third
person, the inflectional pronoun is second person plural; and if both conjuncts are third person, the inflectional pronoun is third person plural.
When the conjunction hi conjoins noun phrases, a plural inflectional
pronoun appears on the verb or postposition. This is not the case with the
postposition -hi.
As (190) shows, the subject of the verb is singular when
-hi is a postposition. Sentence (190) has the structure shown in (193).

31.3.2Other phrasal conjunctionsThe other phrasal conjunctions are also conjunctions rather than postpositions. The arguments for this are similar to those given in section 31.3.1
- optionality and plural inflection - and examples are not given here.
There are phrasal conjunctions that fall in the lexical category conjunction
in Slave.
31.3.3The sentential conjunctionsThe lexical category of sentential conjunction is not so clearly defined.
There are some arguments that suggest that some of these are conjunctions while others are postpositions.
Pronominal inflection on the postpostions/conjunctions in Hare suggests that some are conjunctions. Word
order also suggests this. Evidence from coreference phenomena also pro-Conjunction1075vides some evidence that some are conjunctions. See chapter 30 for discussion. Of these forms, -tl'$ah£ 'after,' -were 'before,' -t'äh 'because,' -he
'because,' -ghäri 'by means of,' and -k'i 'after' function as conjunctions as
well as postpositions, -ts'fh 'from,' -ts'p 'to,' and -t'gh 'since,' on the other
hand, pattern as postpositions only.
In Hare, the postposition/conjunctions
-were, -hi, -ghdri, and -k'i
can be preceded by yi. This form yi is an anaphoric pronoun, related to
the complementizer that marks relative clauses.
It occurs in sentences
such as those in (196) through (199). 9

nouns. It also occurs before the complementizers gha and ch'ä. What is
important here is that there are some postpositions that appear to function as complementizers.
There are a number of arguments that show
that the morphemes gha and ch'ä function differently from the other
postpositions and that these two are best viewed as complementizers.
One way in which these postpositions that can also be complementizers
differ from those that are only postpositions is that only the complementizers can be preceded by (ha)yi.
This anaphoric form does not appear to
be used with postpositions, only with complementizers.
If the postposition/conjunctions in sentences such as (196) through
(199) are conjunctions, then the anaphoric form yi can never occur with
postpositions, but only with conjunctions and complementizers.
If they
are postpositions, it is unexplained why yi fails to occur in many cases
where it would be expected. For instance, it cannot occur with the postpositions -ts'fh 'from' and -ts'§ 'to,' as shown in (200) and (201).","[1118, 1119]"
"(138)k'exeenaxeidhah's/he packed us around' (SI)In (138), there are both the incorporated stem xee- 'pack' and the direct
object agreement pronoun naxe- 'first person plural direct object.' The dclassifier is not present.
It appears that the presence of the d- classifier in forms such as (137) is
accompanied by a shift in transitivity, so the incorporated noun, a type of
reflexive, can occur but there cannot be an independent direct object.
When there is no d- classifier present, and thus no change in subcatego25rization, both an incorporated noun and a direct object may be possible.
The d- classifier used as a reflexive optionally creates an intransitive
verb. If there is not a change in subcategorization, the verb can have the
reflexive object ?ede- while if there is a change in subcategorization, this
object is not present.
It appears that the reflexive direct object pronoun
cannot occur independently of the 9 d-ft classifier while the classifier can occur independently of the pronoun.
The morpheme na- customary is optional while the d- classifier is obligatory in the customary form. This is illustrated in (139).
(139)nadet'oh
det'oh's/he goes customarily by boat' (SI)
's/he goes customarily by boat'The morpheme na- 'again, back' is generally present with the d- classifier.
The addition of the d- classifier creates passives, reflexives, reciprocals,
customary forms, and 'back, again' forms. The word formation rule introducing this classifier can cause syntactic and semantic changes as well as
morphological changes.
The h- classifier also creates changes in syntax
and semantics of the theme. These classifiers can cooccur with each other.
26.1.5The output of the lexiconThe theme is the basic unit of the lexicon. In addition to themes, the
lexicon includes affixes. Each affix and theme is listed in the lexicon along
with its idiosyncratic properties, phonological, morphological, syntactic,
and semantic.
This model of the lexicon does not have full words listed in the lexicon,
but rather forms words from themes by rules of word formation. The result of word formation is that many possible words will be generated, not
all of which are actually occurring words of the language.
The possible words can be divided into several types.
There are the
actually occurring words of the language. There are items that are accidental gaps: they could be words but simply do not exist, or exist in one
dialect but not in another. This type of word is well-formed in every way
but it is just not used. In addition to generating actual words and accidental gaps, the word formation rules can also produce words that are
systematic gaps. These are words that are morphologically and syntacti-978Part IV. The Modelcally well-formed but semantically ill-formed.
Semantically ill-formed words are basically those in which features fail
to match.
For instance, if a verb has a momentaneous prefix but a
semelfactive stem, it is semantically ill-formed.
Other examples of semantically ill-formed words include the following: a conjugation marker
present in the primary aspectual string that is not the conjugation marker
required by the verb theme category of that verb theme, a verb with one
mode marked by the prefixes and a different mode marked by the stem, a
verb with an adverb prefix requiring one conjugation marker but with a
different conjugation marker actually present, a verb with an aspect-determining prefix and a stem in a different aspect, a verb with a third person subject and a third rather than a fourth person object. These semantically ill-formed words are eliminated from the list of actual words by
rules of logical form, rules that filter out words whose features do not
agree.
All the examples of semantically ill-formed words given so far involve
feature matching violations.
Words may also be rejected on semantic
grounds because of an inconsistency between semantic properties of different morphemes.
For instance, the adverbial prefix ts'e- 'awaken' can
occur with classificatory themes, but only with those that allow animate
nouns as the thematic role theme. This prefix does not occur, for instance,
with the classificatory verb 'handle a sticklike object.' The fact that this
prefix and stem do not cooccur is not a morphological or structural fact,
but is rather a semantic fact. It would be possible to use the word 'wake
up sticklike object' in some other world context. As another example, operative theme category verbs can occur with the conative prefix u-, as in
ts'udgdla
'yell at.' Many transitive operative themes do not occur with
this prefix. For example, the form 'comb at' does not occur with it. This
gap too is due to semantic constraints on what activities can be done
without completion. These words simply receive no interpretation.
26.1.6Some sample lexical entriesEach verb theme includes information as to category, phonological form,
and semantics amongst other information. Verb themes must be marked
for theme category, for subcategorization features, and for thematic roles
of their arguments. Since all verbs require a subject, this subcategorization need not be lexically marked, although the thematic role of the subject must be indicated. Verb themes can be subcategorized for a direct or
an oblique object and this information must be lexically indicated.
Simplified lexical entries are given in (140) through (145). These include (1) a representation of the theme, (2) the lexical category, (3) the
theme category, (4) the subcategorization frame, and (5) the thematic
97
roles associated with the arguments in the subcategorization frame.

"Nouns
12.3Other stem163formativesIn the examples in section 12.2, the noun stem and the root are identical
since the stem is formed by the affixing a null suffix to the root. In some
cases, the stem is formed from the root by adding a stem formative suffix
that is not null. There are two of these in Slave. One, the suffix -e or -i is
common and the second, the suffix -I, is found with only a few words.
12.3.1-eThe suffix -e (or -/) is most likely a nominalizer historically. It has no
apparent function in the language synchronically, but is simply required
as a stem formative by some roots. This suffix occurs in the nonpossessed
form. In the possessed form it is deleted and replaced by the possessive
suffix -έ. Several examples of this suffix are given in the data in (3).

root vowels are never deleted.
Suffixed nouns may be related to verb forms as well.
(4) fole'merganser'-fo'be yellow' (Hr)12.3.2 -/
The suffix -/ is found on some nouns. Its identity as -/ is apparent from
the possessed form, where it surfaces as [1]. This suffix is historically an
instrumental, used to derive instrument noun stems from roots. It occurs
in the forms in (5) and (6). The fact that a suffix is present can be seen by
comparing the nouns with related verb forms, where -I is not found.

the object of an unincorporated postposition, as in (20). See unit 14 for
discussion of incorporated and inincorporated postpositions.
?e- is thematic in some cases. The verbs where it is thematic may have
originally been transitive, requiring a direct object. Now ?e- is part of the
verb theme and the theme is intransitive, never taking any other direct
object, either pronominal or nominal. Examples are given in (21) and (22).

words, a verb has a single direct object, either a noun or a pronoun.",[674]
"12.7CompoundnounsNouns can be formed by concatenating lexical items of major categories.
There are noun+noun compounds, postposition+noun compounds, and
noun+verb compounds in Slave. Two classes of compound nouns can be
defined in Slave, with the classes d i f f e r i n g
phonologically,
morphologically, and semantically.
12.7.1Compound nouns - type 1Type 1 compounds have a wide range of meanings. These include the
meanings 'belonging to, used by, used for, associated with, and consisting
of.'
Type 2 compounds are restricted in meaning, having only the
meaning 'made of.'
Some type 1 compounds are clearly compounds historically and
synchronically pattern as compounds phonologically.
However, they
cannot always be divided into meaningful parts. In some cases, one piece
of the compound is definable, while the meaning of the other element is
obscure. In other cases, neither element can be assigned a clear meaning.
These forms are classed with the compounds because they pattern like
compounds phonologically.
Several examples of these semantically
opaque compounds are shown in (79).

"11.1MajorcategoriesThere are three major lexical categories: noun, verb, and postposition.
11.1.1NounNouns are defined largely on the basis of inflection: they can be
inflected with the possessive pronouns. They are also defined on the basis
of distribution: nouns function as subjects and objects.
A variety of
morphological types of nouns fall into this category, including simple
nouns, obligatorily inflected nouns, compound nouns, and nouns derived
from verbs. Independent pronouns also fall into this class. They have the
same distribution as nouns but differ from nouns in that they can never
be inflected for possession. Included in the category of pronouns are the
emphatic pronouns (e.g. sen[ 'my' (Hr, Bl) and the interrogative pronouns
(e.g. ?amii 'who' (Bl, Sh Mt), "">ayli 'what' (Bl, SI, Mt)).
11.1.2VerbThe second major lexical category is that of verb.
Verbs are defined
primarily on the basis of inflection. The verb is the only category to show
inflection for mode and person. Verbs also are defined on the basis of
distribution: they are generally sentence final.
11.1.3PostpositionPostpositions are defined on the basis of inflection: they are inflected f o r
object with the possessive pronouns. The postpositions are defined as a
class distinct from nouns based on a syntactic criterion of coreference
marking. The reflexive pronoun de- is used as object of a postposition if
that object is coreferential to the subject. The reflexive pronoun is used as
possessor of an object noun only when the subject and object are
coreferential third persons. This is illustrated in the examples in (1) for
possessed object nouns and (2) for the object of a postposition.",[201]
"Syntaxonly with hanging topics that there is a noun in topic without a pronoun in

"Notes
1. As discussed in chapter 46, there is a complementizer ni that marks
relative clauses with areal double role nouns. Many of these sentences
with the complementizer ni are ambiguous between the two readings.
2. In some cases, a complement is interpreted as an indirect question if
ni is present but no question word is present.

for further discussion.",[1300]
"42.2Object nouns andpronounsThere are many verbs that are subcategorized for an object, direct or
oblique, and a complement sentence (2b, 2c, 2d, 2f). In many cases, this
object must be preferential to the complement subject. 7 In this section,
these matrix objects/complement subjects and the relationship between
the nouns and the pronouns that occur in them are discussed.
A matrix object and complement subject are often coreferential.
Some
examples are shown in (57) through (60).

are coreferential.
In (57) through (60), the matrix object and the complement subject are
both third person pronouns.
A noun can occur in object position and a
pronoun in complement subject position also.
This is apparent when third
and fourth person pronouns are involved.
If there is no lexical noun in either position, the object pronoun yecurs as matrix object, as in (64) and (65).

structures are different.
In (64) and (65), 'John' is the subject while in
(66) and (67) 'John' is an object.
In (66) and (67), the noun 'John' is part of the matrix sentence. This is
indicated by the lack of an object pronoun in the matrix. 8 It is also indicated by the fact that the reflexive pronoun can occur on the object noun.

'he knows where his brother lives' (Hr)
T h e r e f l e x i v e p r o n o u n occurs only in object position and must occur
within the same simplex sentence as its antecedent.
These two facts lead
to the conclusion that these nouns must be in the matrix.
So far, there have been examples of the matrix object and complement
subject both being pronouns and of the matrix object being a noun and
the complement subject a pronoun.
A third possibility exists: the matrix
object can be a pronoun and the complement subject a noun, as in the examples in (70) through (73).

'Jane is watching Mary play with the dogs' (Bl)
In these sentences, the lexical noun is subject of the complement rather
than object of the matrix. This is suggested by the following facts.
The
object pronoun present in the matrix indicates that there is not an object
noun there. The presence of the possessive pronoun be- in a sentence like
(70) indicates that the noun is the complement subject as well since feedoes not occur in object position if the subject is third person.","[1275, 1276, 1277]"

discussed in section 24.10.3.2.1.
The incorporated stems in section
24.10.3.2.1 function as direct objects.
The incorporated stems under
discussion in this section can cooccur with direct objects and are adverbial
rather than nominal in nature; in other words, they do not serve as
arguments of the verb. A particular noun can function in either way. The
examples in (171) and (172) show the stem xee- 'pack' as a noun (171)
and as an adverb (172).
(171)k'exeeechu's/he is walking around with a pack' (SI)(172)k'exeesaachu's/he packed me around' (SI)It is clear that the stem xee- 'pack' is a direct object in (171) since there is
no other direct object and the verb base is transitive, requiring a direct
object. A direct object se- 'first person singular object' is present in (172).
In Hare, when the incorporated stem xee- functions as an adverbial, a
pronominal direct object precedes rather than follows it.
This marked
ordering of incorporated stem and direct object apparently occurs only in
this construction. Some examples showing this marked order are given in
(173) and (174).
(173)tasexeedjshu'you sg. pack me down' (Hr)(174)kayexeedehshii's/he packed him/her out' (Hr)In (173), the object pronoun se- first person singular is present and in
(174) the object pronoun ye- fourth person occurs.
These pronouns
unexpectedly precede the incorporated stem.
Some speakers optionally include a direct object pronoun when xee- is
incorporated as an adverbial, even when the direct object is not normally
used.
The pronoun in these forms is a direct object rather than a
possessive pronoun.
If it were a possessive pronoun, the incorporated
stem would occur in the possessed form. The fact that it is not in the
possessed form indicates that the pronoun is an object.

an intransitive with only one thematic role results from the word

(pages 129-130)
There is thus a unity to the meaning of the d- classifier as a derivational
component: it produces intransitives and marks theme focus.
The h- classifier, in its derivational function, produces transitives and
marks agent or location focus.","[508, 509]"

Jackendoff names five semantic functions: GO (motional), BE

Complements of the other direct discourse-determining verbs report on
statements about someone.
Complement pronoun markings differ from
those in section 45.2.1.1 because with these verbs the complement is
spoken about rather than to the object of the direct discourse verb or is
simply spoken about something with no matrix object.
45.2.1.2.1 say
The simplest case of reporting about something in direct discourse is
with the verb ndilhadi
'say,' an intransitive verb.
First person in the

discourse verb, as in (37) through (39).

It is more difficult to ascertain whether other thematic prefixes are present in noun theme entries since it is difficult to know whether a noun
with thematic prefixes is derived directly from a theme or indirectly by
nominalization.
Nouns with thematic prefixes that are candidates for
showing that nouns and verbs share the same theme are shown in (10).

'potato'There is no nominalizer in these nouns and they may be cases of nouns
derived directly from themes rather than nouns derived indirectly by
nominalization of a verb.
In examples such as (6), the nouns and verbs share a theme consisting
of a classifier and a root. The theme is unlabelled for category in the lexicon if it can be a noun or a verb. If it can be only a noun or only a verb, it
is labelled for category.
Since the theme contains a root and thematic
prefixes, stem formation rules must apply to assign the stem level labels
of noun and verb. The rules that assign the label noun are the suffixation
rules discussed above.
The rules that are required to assign the label
verb are those that add stem-forming suffixes to the verb. In addition, a
second word formation rule is required for verbs. Every verb must have
at least one syllable preceding the stem. This syllable is added to verbs
by a word formation rule that inserts a syllable before a verb stem. This
rule is shown in (11).
(11)[syllable [X] v ] vIn nouns, the classifier is generally lost since it does not become part of a
syllable. If, however, a syllable is placed before it, as in (7), the classifier
remains.
The facts that it is generally only verbs that have a phonetic
classifier and that it is only verbs that require a prestem syllable are thus
related: the syllable allows the classifier a phonetic realization.
Postposition roots, themes and stems are identical since there are not
thematic prefixes present in postpositions and the stem-forming suffix is
null. Some examples are given in (12).

Summary
The lexicon contains a list of themes, which consist of a root and affixes.
Nouns, verbs and postpositions are formed from themes by suffixation.","[985, 986, 987]"
"Syntaxnouns: the precedence relation is more important than the command relation. Sentences where the pronoun precedes the noun ((20) through (22))
are generally of somewhat lower acceptability than those where the noun
precedes the pronoun.
While both precedence and command are important in Slave, it appears to be more valued for the noun to precede the
pronoun than for the pronoun to not command the noun.
Second, it appears that the postpositions in question are in the process
of being reanalyzed such that they have lexical entries as conjunctions as
well as postpositions. There are two syntactic arguments for this claim.
Some postpositions clearly function as conjunctions as well.
This is
clearest with the postposition -hi (Hr, Bl) / -ih (SI) 'with.'

'Joe went hunting with Robert'
'Joe and Robert went hunting'In (50) and (51), -hi is functioning as a postposition, while in (52) and
(53) it is a conjunction. The main evidence for this claim comes from verb
agreement.
In (50) and (51), the verb themes given require singular
subjects. The verb theme in (53) requires a dual subject. In addition, the
verbs in (52) and (53) show plural number agreement. If the subjects in
(52) and (53) are interpreted as conjoined, then this plural agreement is
accounted for.
Word order also suggests this reanalysis of postpositions into two categories.
Postpositional phrases are base generated following the subject.
Most postpositional phrases remain in this position. This is true of both
phrases with simple objects and those with sentential objects. See chapter
42. However, the apparent postpositional phrases discussed in this section
more commonly precede the subject. This is the position one would expect to find them in if they are not postpositional phrases, but one conjunct of a conjoined structure.
This suggests that sentences like (42) and (44) do not have the structures shown in (43) and (45) respectively, but that the structure given in
(54) is appropriate. 6Coreference
(54)1047S
/
I
\
S CONJUNCTIONSIn other words, these postpositions also fall in the lexical category of conjunction.
The lack of coreferentiality between the pronoun and noun in
sentences like (48) is accounted for by the noncoreference rule.
These
morphemes may also be analyzed as postpositions (although less commonly), as in (49), as shown by the fact that a coreferential reading is possible.
Two structures are thus available.
There may be a postpositional
phrase in topic position and coreference between a pronoun and a following noun is allowed or there may be a conjoined structure and coreference
is prohibited.
The move towards reanalysis of some postpositions as conjunctions also
and the tendency to prefer the noun before the pronoun work together to
make coreferential readings of sentences such as (48) highly marked.","[1090, 1091]"

'he gave us the fish Bill caught'These sentences show relative clauses where the double role noun is an
object, oblique (8, 9, 10) or direct (11, 12), within the restricting sentence.
Two facts suggest that the double role noun is contained within the restricting sentence. The first is word order. In sentences such as (6) and
(11), the word order within the restricting sentence is Subject Object
Verb. If the double role noun were part of the higher sentence, as in (4),
one would expect the matrix object to precede the complement subject.
The second fact that indicates that the double role noun is part of the
restricting sentence is the lack of pronouns as objects. If the double role
noun in a sentence such as (8) were part of the matrix, a pronominal object of the postposition would be required in the subordinate clause since
a postposition must have an object argument. Since there is no pronominal object, the noun must be within the same sentence as the postposition.
In internally headed relative clauses, there is no external head noun
and the double role noun occurs within the restricting sentence. A rule of
semantic interpretation indexes a noun phrase within a subordinate
clause with the noun phrase that dominates it, allowing the noun phrase
to be interpreted as part of both the higher and the lower sentences.
Sentences can be ambiguous: more than one noun in the restricting sentence can be interpreted as a double role noun, as in (13) and (14).

A reading of Ί like the woman who built the house' is not possible for this

'woman' is the first noun
of the restricting sentence because yenene
cannot serve as an object of
the higher sentence 'it is good for me.' The higher verb has an areal object go- and yenene

'you gave me the moose that your son shot with the gun' (SI)In (16), the verb theme 0-tln in the matrix requires an object that has the
quality of being extended and rigid. In (17), the verb theme in the matrix
requires an object that is animate. The choice of matrix verb restricts the
potential choice of nouns to fill the double role: semantically, only one of
the nouns within the restricting sentence can be interpreted in the matrix.
These examples show that relative clauses can have internal heads.
In
general, it is the first noun of the lower sentence that is interpreted as
head noun unless the matrix verb imposes restrictions that force the
choice of another noun as the head.
Before discussing externally headed relative clauses, a note on relative
clauses when relativization is into subject position is in order. In the rel-Relative Clauses1313ative clauses above, relativization is into object position and it is clear that
the double role nominal is in the restricting sentence. 5
When relativization is into subject position, it is not clear whether the double role noun is
part of the matrix or the restricting sentence.
Word order does not help
decide as the subject is the first word of the sentence. Pronouns also do
not help as the subject pronouns do not vary in form.
Sentences like
those in (18) through (22), where the double role noun is the subject of
the restricting sentence, may thus come from an internally headed structure, as in (4), or an externally headed structure, as in (5).

"Notes
1. While causing is bringing about an event, letting is ceasing to preventMiscellaneous Complement-Taking Verbs1307an event. Jackendoff (1976) posits that CAUSE and LET are different
semantic functions. While these functions are present in the Slave
verb stem, as, for example, in the existence of different stems for
'lower' (CAUSE) and 'drop' (LET), there do not seem to be different
verbs expressing just causing or letting. These functions must be distinguished by context.
2. There is dialect variation. Notably -id may be imperfective in Hare
((71)). This is not usually the case: -tee is more common ((57)). The
use of -td as imperfective appears to be restricted to first person
plural.
3. The structure required by these verbs is discussed in chapter 42.
4. The first person plural stem is subject to variation. It can be -did (47),
-yd (52, 53), or -Id (71). An individual may use more than one.","[1350, 1351]"

"45.4LexicalfeaturesVerbs allowing direct discourse interpretation of their complements
must be diacritically marked in the lexicon since there do not seem to be
features that this follows from.
Since there are two different kinds of
direct discourse-determining verbs, two features are needed, one for
direct statements (statements to someone) and one for indirect statements
(statements about someone).
This diacritic feature is apparently not a property of the verb theme, as
the following examples show. The verb theme 0-ni 'say, speak' requires a
direct discourse interpretation of the complement in some cases while in
other cases it requires an indirect discourse interpretation
(?ek0-e-de-0ni). The verb theme 0-when
(Bearlake form) is similar: the base
ye-ne-07
when
'want' takes a direct discourse complement while the base
a-hw h e n 'cause, affect' requires an indirect discourse complement.
It
appears that the diacritic indicating direct discourse is actually a feature
of prefixes rather than of themes since a given theme can take
complements of either discourse type. 445.5SummaryComplement-taking verbs in Slave are of two types, those requiring
direct discourse interpretation of the complement and those requiring
indirect discourse interpretation.
These types of interpretation differ by
the point of view from which the pronouns of the complement sentence
are interpreted.
Possible anaphoric relations in Slave are determined by rules of control
and noncoreference interpretation, (chapters 30, 42).
A similar rule is1292Part VSyntaxneeded to interpret coreference relations of complement pronouns of a
direct discourse verb.
The rule of direct discourse interpretation is
outlined in section 45.2.
Two rules are required, one for reporting
statements to someone and one for reporting statements about someone.
These rules are given in (36) and (44). A rule similar to control discussed
in chapter 42 marks possible coreference relations between the object of
the transitive 'want' and complement pronouns.
If there is no possible
coreference relation between the object and pronouns in the complement,
the direct discourse control filter marks the sentence as ungrammatical.","[1335, 1336]"
"Chapter 36
Yes/No QuestionsThere are three strategies for forming yes/no questions in Slave, each
with a different meaning. In one case, the questioner has no e x p e c t a t i o n
as to the response to the question. In the second case, a positive answer is
expected. The third case involves focus questions, where a particular constituent is questioned and the rest of the sentence is presupposed. These
three question types are discussed in this chapter.

"The Modelthey choose and which verb theme category or categories they occur with.
The lexicon thus contains themes, the minimal lexical specification of a
word, and affixes.
The nature of the themes and their relationship to
words is discussed below.
In many cases, there does not appear to be any difference between a
noun root and a noun theme.
Since nouns often are not prefixed, the
theme will not include any more lexical material than the root.
Noun words are often identical to noun themes (and thus to noun roots).
The noun word can be formed from the theme by zero derivation.
The
derived form is the noun stem. Some examples are shown in (3).
(3) t u
sah
ko
-kwi'water'
'bear'
'fire'
'head' (Bl)In these words, there is no difference between the theme and the word,
suggesting that the noun formative is a null affix, a suffix since category
determining affixes in Slave are suffixes.
Noun words are not necessarily identical to themes. Some nouns (noun
stems) differ from the theme by the presence of a final I I I in the word.
This consonant is historically a noun stem formative that derives instrumental nouns from themes. Examples are given in (4).

This consonant derives historically
from the Athapaskan instrumental suffix * - t . The suffix is not used productively in Slave but is lexicalized with some nouns.
There are some nouns that include an obligatory suffix. This suffix has
the form -e, as in (5). It too is a stem formative.

'be red'The question of whether nouns and verbs share not just a root but also a
theme can be posed. At a word level, more lexical material is required in
the verb than in the noun. While a noun word can consist of a stem alone
(root plus stem-forming suffix), a verb word must contain not only a root
and a stem-forming suffix but also a classifier and any thematic prefixes
(and inflection for person, number, mode). While at the word level verbs
and nouns which share a root differ, is this true at the theme level?
There is some evidence that nouns and verbs not only share roots, but
share themes. There are some nouns in Slave that occur with a prefix in
some dialects and that are related to verbs. When the related verb theme
has an h- classifier, this morpheme is present in the prefixed noun form.
Some examples are given in (7).

In prefixed nouns related to verbs with the 0 classifier, this h- does not
appear before the noun stem.

theme with the h- classifier also has the h- classifer since one related to a
verb with the 0 classifier does not have an h-. If the classifier is present
in the noun theme as well as in the verb theme entry, then the presence
of the classifier in the prefixed noun form can be accounted for. If the
classifier is not present in the noun theme, the presence of [h] in the
prefixed noun is idiosyncratic and unpredictable.
This suggests that
related nouns and verbs share a theme, a lexical entry unmarked for
category, and a function of stem formation rules is to assign category.
Further evidence that related nouns and verbs share a common theme
can be seen in some compound forms. In (9), the d- classifier occurs on
the second member of the compound.","[984, 985]"

Since both nouns and pronouns fill this role, only one of them can be present. With third person subjects, the subject pronoun is always null and it
is thus difficult to know whether or not a subject pronoun is present w h e n
there is a nominal subject.

Only humans are grammatically marked for plural in Slave.
The object pronouns go- and ku- appear to be markers of human plural
number, parallel to the subject form ke-lge-.
As with the person pronouns, the form of the human plural morpheme is dictated by its grammatical function. This is shown in the examples above where the object
pronoun is present only when the object is human. If the object is plural
nonhuman, no object pronoun is present. When noun objects are present,
the parallels beween ke-lge- and ku-lgo- become clear: they are markers
of human plural number. The use of go- and ku- as solely plural human
number is obscured when no nominal object is present because they are
extended in use to any plural oblique object.
In general, the third person pronoun can be considered as unmarked for
number. It can combine with a human plural number morpheme to give
a marked plural form.
When a noun is possessed by another noun, the same patterns emerge.
No plural number pronoun is present unless the possessor is human
plural.

Others are human number markers that cooccur
with third person forms. Still others indicate gender. The anaphoric pronouns (reflexive and reciprocal) are not included in the chart, but the
anaphoric pronoun ye- fourth person is.
The choice of pronouns other than third and fourth person is based on
the grammatical relation the pronoun bears to the verb. Choice of third
and fourth person pronouns is more complex, controlled by semantic as
well as syntactic features. These pronouns are the focus of this chapter.
28.1.1Singular pronounsThe pronouns 0 , be-lme-, ye-, and 7ede-/deindicate third and fourth
person objects and possessors. The required form is determined by syntactic and semantic factors. First, the form is determined by a syntactic
criterion: the grammatical relation of the pronoun to the category that
governs it.
Second, it is determined by semantic factors: features of
person, number, and potential humanness of the subject and the object.
28.1.1.1 yeye- is a fourth person object pronoun, an anaphor used when the subject is third person. It indicates that the object must be noncoreferential
to the subject. It functions as direct object (2), oblique object (3), and
possessor of an object noun (4).

"Syntaxas a fixed location in time or space. The noun must be interpreted as
nonareal if the pronoun is not present. Some nouns have only an areal
interpretation and the gender pronoun must be present (108).
Other
nouns cannot occur with the gender pronoun and have no areal interpretation (for example, nohbäli 'tent,' 7eki 'teepee,' -t'6o 'nest,' ?oghi
'den,
cave1).
Other nouns are sometimes interpreted as areal, as in (109)
through (111). Other such nouns are 7ek'ilu 'road' and shih 'mountain.'
Sentences are filtered out if a noun that is areal does not cooccur with
the gender pronoun and if a noun that must be nonareal does occur with
the gender pronoun.
With the nouns that can have either reading, sentences are interpretable whether the areal pronoun is present or not.
This gender marking system appears to be in a state of flux in most dialects. For many speakers, few nouns are marked for areal gender. Even
with those that are, the gender agreement does not always occur.
28.6.2The gender prefix de- (verb prefix position 9)The gender prefix de- marks wood, leaves, and branches. This gender
prefix is optional: some speakers seem to use it quite commonly while for
others it is rare.
This gender prefix, like go-, occurs when the noun of that gender fills
the thematic role of theme.
A number of examples are given in (112)
through (125). In (112) through (116) the gender marked noun is a subject, in (117) through (124) it is a direct object, and in (125) it is an

Whether the 0-h classifier relationship is that between process and
action-process, functions; or that between position and possession, modes;
is dependent on verb theme category.
Active verb themes fall into the
former category, relating a process and an action process while neuter
verb themes fall into the latter, relating a position and a possession.
This classifier productively forms causatives.
See chapter 46 for
discussion of periphrastic causatives with the verb ?a-0-ieh
'let, cause.'
24.2.3.2PassivesWhile the h- classifier changes semantic functions and modes, the dclassifier does not.
One of the primary derivational functions of this
classifier is that of passivizer. Semantically, it effects a change in focus,
causing a shift from agent focus to theme focus. Morphosyntactically, it
makes the direct object into the subject.
The /- classifier has the same effect as the d- classifier. The I- classifier
can be thought of as being phonologically secondary, derived from the
classifiers d + h. The d- causes voicing of the h- classifier, as in the first
person dual/plural forms of h- classifier verbs.
Both the d- and this
voiced segment are later deleted, showing their effect only continuant
initial verbs where the continuant is voiced throughout the paradigm.
Under this treatment, originally suggested by Stanley (1969) for Navajo,
the function of passive, reflexive and reciprocal are identified with only
one classifier, d-, rather than with two. The Z- classifier is thus found only
in those cases where it is thematic and is never used derivationally.
In (67) through (80), 0 classifier transitive themes are given in the (a)
forms and derived passives with the d- classifier in the (b) forms.

1. The numeral 'four' is often pronounced [ d j y ] in all dialects. This word

the usual development of velar-final forms in Slave: the velar is lost

consonant historically. (The forms tai 'three' and syläi 'five' had a final
velar historically. Compare with Chipewyan taye 'three' and sasyläye
'five.') The form [dj γ ], found in all dialects, shows an alternative
development: the final vowel is lost but the velar maintained.

The use of the third person oblique object be-lmerather than fourth
person y e - is correlated with the thematic role of agentivity: if the subject
can be interpeted as an agent, then ye- is used as oblique object while if it
cannot be interpreted as an agent, then be-lmeis used. A sentence such
as (24) can be grammatical.
(24)bebi y j t l ' a d a w e'the baby fell from his/her hand' (Hr)
(cf. (20b))In (24), the action is interpreted as volitional on the part of the baby, as a
controlled action. The (b) versions of (19) through (21) have a nonagent
reading as primary and thus the pronoun be-lmeis found.
Why is be-lmebe used this way?
Thompson (1979) suggests a discourse function for the pronoun *W9- (Slave be-lme-).
He points out that
a function of this pronoun in Athapaskan is to indicate an unstated object
when the subject is a nonidentical third person and the object a topic or
focus of the discourse. When a subject is nonhuman (or nonagentive), the
object is discourse topic, be-lmemarks that the object is discourse topic.
28.1.1.4?ede-lde-The reflexive pronoun marks direct (25) or oblique (26) objects that are
coreferential to the subject.
It also indicates the possessor of an object
noun when that possessor is third person coreferential to the subject (27).

"Relative Clauses13292. The head noun of the relative clause thus occurs to the left of the restricting sentence.
Such a structure is marked for SOV languages
where prenominal relative clauses are expected.
3. The term 'restricting sentence' is generally used to describe the embedded sentence in a structure like (5). It is not used to describe the
embedded sentence in (4). I will use this term in a very general way,
however, so that the embedded sentences in both (4) and (5) will be
called restricting sentences.
4. A complementizer does not always occur. It is most common in Hare.
In other dialects relative clauses are often unmarked for subordinate
status.
This is true of complements in general: complementizers are
common in Hare and less frequent in the other dialects.
5. When just third persons are involved in the restricting sentence, the
relative clause structure is unambiguous.
When other persons are involved, either structure is possible. For example, in (i) it is impossible
to tell whether liht'ie
'bread' is an external or an internal head noun
since there is no independent subject pronoun and the third person direct object marker is null when the subject is nonthird person.

"26.1.2Word formation rulesWords are formed in the lexicon by word formation rules that put together affixes and themes. The output of the word formation rules is a
list of possible words of the language.
26.1.2.1 A semantic description of word formation
Descriptions of word formation proposed in the Athapaskan literature
focus on formation of the verb. The verb offers an example of what is
called a bracketing paradox: the structure of the verb required by the
morphosemantics and the ordering of affixes in the verb are not identical.
Much discussion in the literature on verb formation focusses on semantic structure. Kari (1979) presents an explicit description of a possible
model of verb formation. In his model, there are several levels of word
formation. At levels one and two, verb themes and subthemes are listed. 4
Levels three through six are derivations built on the theme. Level three
is an aspectual derivation (mode and aspect), level four errative, level five
super (compounding) aspects, and level six is non-aspectual derivations.
At this level the base is defined.
Levels seven through nine are for
gender, negative, and pronoun marking, which are syntactically defined.
Kari's model includes a number of levels where the process occurring at
each level is semantically defined. The order of affixation is not linear.
Instead, prefixes are inserted in a way not discussed explicitly by Kari
into the correct linear position in the string.
A model such as this which does not impose linear ordering on prefixes
is appropriate as a semantic model of the Athapaskan verb. By adopting
such a model, many apparently anomalous facts about the Athapaskan
verb, such as inflection occurring inside of derivation, can be accounted
for. Just how the prefixes come to be linearly ordered must be accounted
for.
There is some phonological evidence suggesting that inflectional
pronominal prefixes in position 12 are added late: it is only in this
position that consonant clusters are allowed, stem and disjunct phonology
is similar while conjunct phonology is different. I will not deal with how
the verb is formed in any detail. Instead, I look briefly at some of the
rules required. Because many of these rules refer to syllable structure, I
turn to this structure in the following section.
26.1.2.2 Syllable structure
The phonetically possible syllable structures in Slave are limited to

The syllable structure template in (14) shows permissible syllables at

of a word, more than one consonant may follow a nucleus.
26.1.2.3 Noun formation
There are several topics to be considered under the formation of nouns.
These include possession, prefixed nouns, suffixed nouns, compounds and
nominalizations.
26.1.2.3.1 Possession
Most nouns are inflected for possession in two ways. A possessive prefix (or noun) indicating possessor is added to the noun. In addition, many
nouns take a possessive suffix of the form -e (alienable possession) or
high tone (inalienable possession). The suffix -έ is shown in (15).

There are several different types of nouns in Slave, as discussed in
chapter 12. These include the following:
(a) stem nouns. These are nouns consisting of a stem alone. The stems
are formed from themes by zero derivation. Examples are given in (17).

'bear'Prefixed nouns are derived from nounthemesAn Overview of Slave Grammar945where there is a derivational prefix in addition to the theme (root and
thematic prefixes). This derivational prefix is not part of the theme of the
noun since it need not be present in a related verb form. Some of the
prefixes occurring on prefixed nouns are go- areal, ?e- unspecified, and
de- 'wood.' Already discussed suffixation processes are found.
(18) gohkwj

?ehkee'axe'

'round stretcher'(c) other suffixed nouns. The nouns in (17) and (18) have a null form
suffix. Two other suffixes can occur, -/ and -e. See section 26.1.1.2.
(d) compounds.
There are two major types of compounds in Slave.
Type 1 compounds have the general meanings belonging to, used by, used
for, associated with, consisting of. Several examples are given in (19).
(19) a. tehzaä
'polar bear'
teh 'water' + xah 'bear' + -e possessive
b. gosimjle

?ah 'snowshoe' + tl'u 'string'
e. ? ahtl'ule
'babiche on snowshoe'

Type 1 compounds can be broken into three groups, depending on morphology. These are shown in (20).

Summary
Some of the prefixes of the shape de- in Slave have been presented.
These prefixes are generally not productive. The verbs they occur in are
probably best considered to be subthemes of themes.
24.5.2.2ne-24.5.2.2.1 ne- mind, feeling
There is a prefix with the form ne-, ni-, ?eni-, and ?edi-.
It occurs in
bases having to do with mental processes. This prefix is thematic in some
cases and non-thematic in others. It is related to the noun ni 'thought,'

"2.4LanguageStatusWhile each community is unique with regard to the use of the Slave
language, there are a few general patterns.
Some communities are
basically monolingual Slave and some are mixed Slave-English.
There are a few Slave communities that are basically monolingual
Slave. In these communities, all children enter school fluent in Slave and
many children have little or no English on entering school. Slave is
definitely the preferred language in everyday communication.
The
communities of Fort Franklin and Colville Lake fall in this category.
The majority of Slave communities can best be characterized as mixed
Slave-English.
In these communities, most adults are bilingual and many
children enter school speaking both Slave and English or with at least a
passive competence in one and active competence in the other.
The
communities differ considerably as to where they fall within this wide
range.
For instance, in Fort Good Hope, Wrigley, Fort Liard, and Fort
Norman, most children have passive competence in Slave and many speak
the language.
In Fort Simpson far fewer children speak or understand
Slave when they enter school.",[58]

Summary
In the Athapaskan literature, levels of root, theme, base, and word are
introduced.
While the level of root is clearly identifiable and well-defined, roots are not lexical entries. Themes form the basic entry, where a
theme consists of a root and any prefixes that must occur with that root.
26.1.1.2 The lexical entry
The lexicon consists of themes, a root and prefixes that must occur with
it, and affixes. The theme entry includes the following information.
1. syntactic category
Each item in the lexicon must be marked for syntactic category. Only
the categories of verb, noun, and postposition are considered here. 1
2. phonological representation
The segmental and tonal representation of each theme is given in the
lexicon.
3. semantic representation
Among the semantic features are the verb theme category of a verb
theme and the thematic roles allowed by a verb theme.
4. subcategorization information
Themes must be marked for subcategorization features.
Some nouns
are marked as requiring a subject (a possessor), postpositions are marked
as requiring an object. Verb themes are marked for transitivity.
They
may require either a direct or an oblique object and this too must be indicated in the lexical entry.
Lexical entries for affixes are similar.
following information:These entries must include the1. phonological information
2. subcategorization information
The lexical category an affix can attach to and the lexical category
produced is indiacted. Affixes have lexical representations as below:
X-[X[Y]v]vThis entry says that the prefix X attaches to a lexical item Y of the category verb (V) to produce a verb.
3. syntactic changes
The attachment of certain prefixes, namely the classifiers, can bring
about changes in syntactic subcategorization frames. This information is
part of the lexical entry of the prefix.
4. diacritics
For each verb prefix, it is necessary to indicate its level of attachment
and its position of attachment within the level. See section 26.1.3.
5. semantic representation
The semantic representation includes the meaning of the affix. Many
verb prefixes also include a feature indicating which conjugation marker940Part IV.","[982, 983, 984]"
