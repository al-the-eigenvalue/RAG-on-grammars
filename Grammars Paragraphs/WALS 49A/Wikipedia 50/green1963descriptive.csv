"The Part Played by Tone in Igho Grammar177qualified by a relative verb form this tone will fall on the last syllable of the verb. Thus we get
Ahyé firt uka “The market caused a dispute”. But we also get Ahya o ld! fara uka “His notleaving the market (lit. the market he did not leave) caused trouble”. There is also tonal
interaction between verb form and noun object in which the tone of verb as well as noun is
involved, for instance in the unsuffixed imperative and Subject Verb Form IT, main,
suffixed, of a low tone verb. Again, what is required here is a tonal relationship.un-With facts like these it is difficult to exclude the verb from expressing the category of case.
But as far as terminologyis concernedwe have not spokenof case, evenhave spoken rather of relations, in our descriptions of grammaticalfor nominals,butbehavior. This is in noway to deny that the eategory of case is present. Rather it is to draw attention to the way in
which this category is expressed in Igbo grammar.",[197]

"The Affirmative Verb Forms85used as a complete exclamatory utterance. In this case it is normally preceded by ka, and
though in some cases ka is omitted it always could, formally speaking, be there. The use
of this verb form in clauses of complete utterance, though frequent in colloquial speech,
is thus highly restricted, and is not comparable with the behaviour of Subject Vers Form I
and IT, main. We thus classify it as subordinate. Its exclamatory usage must not however be
overlooked and we give some examplesbelow.",[105]
"'This is also the case, in some instances, with w and 9, as in the verb inwé (inwo) “to shine”.
The same thing occurs with the consonants hw and h in some cases, as in the verb ihwi(thu) “to see”, “to roast’. Hw appears to be “deep” Qhwuhwy Qhuhu) and h more general.
In the table brackets are used as in this note.",[26]
"4. Nouns in Genitival Relationship
A noun can follow another noun in genitival relationship. The tonal behaviour of both
nouns is then involved. The situation is therefore different from that of a language like Latin,
for instance, where only the noun in the genitive case is inflected. For example, if ddha “eldest
daughter’ follows d/a in genitival relationship we get 0 zur dla ddha “He bought the eldestdaughter's land”’ (lit. land of eldest daughter). Both nouns have taken non-inherent tones.
In the same way, if ji “yam” follows wld ‘“house”’ in genitival relationship we get 0 hard
ulo jt,“He saw the yam store’’ (lit. house of yams). There are also instances where only one
of the nouns takes non-inherent tones, and others, all according to definite rules, where bothnouns retain their inherent tones. Always it is the genitival noun which comes second. The
noun preceding it may be said to be in pre-genitival position.",[40]
"4) Ci. L R. Palmer, “The Latin Language”,Faber and Faber, London1954, p, 308: ‘*Indo-Euro-pean, as we have seen in the previous chapter, had developed no grammatical category of tense, the
so-called tense sterns indicating different “aspects” of the verbal action. Latin, however, evolved acomprehensive system of references to present, future and past, with each of its two aspectual stems
and it was also meticulous in indicating the chronological relationship of events echeloned im time.
This, too, was a Latin innovation which is absent from Greek.” Cf. also H. Hoijer, “Relation of Language to Culture” in A. L. Kroeber, ‘‘Anthropology Today’’, 1953, p. 664, re “temp oral forms of verbs”,(«)WO!","[85, 86]"
"Except for the inflexional verbal prefix, grammatical relations are, as we have seen, expressed by word order and by tone. With a fixed word order, allowing of little deviation,
has tone a real part to play or is it merely an “extra’’, a frill that could be omitted
without being much missed? This is, of course, an improper question. It is not for the
student of language to decide which of the means of expression any particular language could
dispense with. It is for him to accept them as they stand and to try to understand the part
they play. And to an Igho speaker tone isas much a part of the linguistic apparatus as are
phonemes or any other of its means of expression. It is the European who is struck by its unfamiliarity. But it is none the less legitimate, while accepting tone as an essential part of Igbo
grammar, to ask whether or not there are times when it expresses grammatical relations
which, in terms of word order, would be ambiguous. The answer is, of course, that it does.
And the fact that the context also helps is neither more nor less relevant here than in anyother linguistic situation.
We have noted, for instance, how the tonal behaviour of a noun object may help to
distinguish two different verb forms otherwise liable to be confused. There is also the obvious
case of a verb form followed by two nouns which, according to the word order, might be
either a first and second object or a pair of nouns in genitival relationship. Thus with the
same tone classes of noun we have:O nyere Adha okuko“He gave Adha a hen’’Two noun objectsO nyere akhwa okuko“He gave hen’s eggs”Two nouns in genitival
relationship1) Op. cit.",[197]
"It is also expressed by aparticular inflexional tone pattern in the pre-genitival noun. What, in fact, is required is a
particular tonal relationship and this is achieved, sometimes by a change in the inherent
tone of one noun, sometimes of the other, sometimes of both. Tone, in Igbo, stresses the fact
that in any relationship at least two relata are involved. This fact tends to be obscured by a
linguistic terminology which, as in Latin, speaks of a noun as being in the genitive case. In
Igbo a noun is genitive not only in virtue of its own behaviour but of that of the pre-genitival
noun. For example, if the nouns odh% “tail” and oke “rat” are in genitival relationship, both
have non-inherent tones, od/hi dke “the rat’s tail”. Moreover a noun may, both by word order
and by tone, mark its relationship to what follows and to what precedes. In the followingsentence the noun madhu “person” has non-inherent tones both in relation to the preceding
noun, to which it is in genitival relationship, and to the following verb, to which it is in
subject relationship. Ndi kore akuko @ st wu ukpa madhi di iché iché. “Those who told these
stories were types of people of various kinds” (Text V, 1. 28).
What might be called this fore and aft system of grammatical relations expressed by toneis typical of Igbo. Tone relates each part of speech to that which precedes and that which
follows it within the clause.",[196]

"Chapter XXII
The SecondaryGrammatical CategoriesIn considering the secondary grammatical categories such as person, number, gender, case
it is important to remember that they will be differently expressed*) and will have a differentscope*) in different languages, if indeed they are present at all. To labour this would be to
flog a dead horse.
Gender does not appear to be grammatically expressed in Igbo.
Person and number are grammatically expressed only by pronoun sequence, so far as
we can see.

Consonant harmony occurs in the sense that nasality may, in some instances, persist fromone syllable to another. This has been found in the case of certain of the suffixes when they
follow a verb stem of which the initial consonant is nasal or nasalized.",[22]
"It will be rememberedthat,withtheseaffimativeforms,whentwo-ra suffixesare present one of them is represented by its alternant, a vowel which lengthens the vowel
of the preceding syllable. In the case of open vowels we should thus get
a suffix indistinguishable from the open vowel suffix. In the same way, the -ra(time) suffix is not found with

"Moreover its vowel harmonizes with the vowel of the preceding syllable not only in level but
in position. That is to say that a front vowel is followed by an open front one and a back

"In this connection an interesting point may be noted. In the tone pattern of nouns in
genitival relationship, with one exception, the tone which changes in the second, or genitive,noun is that of the syllable adjacent to the pre-genitival noun. In the case of N hh, however,
it is the tone of the second, or non-adjacent, syllable which changes, as in ist eght “goat'shead”’. This shows clearly that the unit involved in the tone change is the part of speech and
not merely the juxtaposed syllables. This principle of tone change on account of what precedes does not, however, carry further than two syllables. With a trisyllabic noun such, forinstance, as N hhh, we get isi akwukwo.",[42]
"176Green/Izwe, Grammar of IgboIn the three following sentences, for instance, the pronoun in the second clause varies according to the pronouns in the first clause, and in so doing is expressing both person and
number’):

traditional European linguistic facts as the relations of nominals to verbs as subject or object,
or to each other as genitives, or to prepositions, we find such relations expressed in Igbo by
word order and
or Latin.tone, but with many ramifications unknown to such a language as EnglishNot only, for instance, is genitival relationship of a noun to another noun expressed by
post-position and by a special tone pattern in the genitival noun.","[195, 196]"
"The only derivational affixes that have been conclusively found in nouns are prefixes. The
suffixes which often occur, like -/a in neéta, are lexical, or compoundingelements*)and arefound with other parts of speech as well as with nouns. Their most frequent occurrence is
with verbs and many examples will be found with the verb forms and in the texts.4) There
is however, a vowel suffix found in such nouns as aghud “‘hunger’’, or ukwut “greatness’’,
which may perhaps be derivational and may indicate a subclass of abstract nouns.
1) See p. 12 Note 3.
*) Caution would thus seem to be indicated in comparative studies of African languages in which
common roots are postulated. On the other hand, comparative studies may throw light on individual
languagos in this respect.
3) See chapter “Suffixes”’ infra.
') Wewrite them joined to the verb, and also joined to the noun in the case of suffixes like -ta, whichonly occur when the noun has a radical element. Other suffixes such as -kwa or -ni, which ean follow
any type of noun, we write separately, in accordance with present spelling usage. We have always recorded the tone of suffixes following nouns but have not fully worked out, and have not set out, the
rules of their tonal behaviour after nouns.",[34]
"‘‘Form” is being used in a different sense fromthe oneGreen/Igwe,54Grammar of IgboThe fact that in some dialects, though not in Ohuhu, the vowel of the element -cha, to whichwe referred above, harmonizes with the vowel of the verb stem it follows, is a piece of evidence
pointing to the verbal origin, in some cases at least, of suffixes.
With a verb stem containing a nasal or nasalized consonant the nasality runs on through
some suffixes but not through others. In compound verbs the position seems to be thatnasality will not run on from the first verb stem to the second if there is thereby any dangerof confusion of meaning.","[73, 74]"
"Verb FormsThe Imperative, NegativeThe morpheme constituents of this form are the cy verb stem with a harmonizing vowel
prefix, a-(e-), according to the stem vowel. The tone of the prefix is high. That of the verbstem is mid for high tone verbs before an object but low if no object follows. It is low for low
tone verbs in cither case.
Whereambiguity might arise a suffix is added, the -la suffix being often used.",[135]
"178Green/Igwe,Grammar of IgboMore complicated examples of identical word order but grammatical differentiation by
tone can be seen in the following pair of sentences, where no distinction of lexical tone
comes in.
O hida ozu éke nwiru“He has found the corpse of the rat whichn'ulodied in the house”
“He has eaten the nuts Adha hid in the house”’O taala akhu Adha 20r6 n’°uldIn the first, the nouns oZu dke are in genitival relationship followed by Subject Verb
Form I, sub., rel. A. In the second, Adha is not a genitive but the subject of Subject Verb
FormI, sub., rel. B, in a clause which qualifies akhw. In each case N hh ou, akhu is followedby N lh, dke, Adha.
In the following sentence not only word order and lexical tone but words are identical.
Grammatical differentiation is by tone and by a slight pausal factor, which occurs after
ohya in the first version and after aghw in the second.
Onye pyoro ohya ‘aghu na acu ya oso
Onye pyoro ohya aghh na acu ya oso“Anyone who roams
leopard chases him”aboutinthebush,a‘‘Anyone who roams about in bush where there
is a leopard makes him run (i. e. startles him)”Tone is, in fact, a sensitive barom®ter of grammatical change, or rather, a sensitive instru-ment. And in Igbo the relations of each part of speech to that which precedes and follows it
is expressed, either actually or potentially1), by tone, in addition to, or independentlyof,word order.
We have set out, in the preceding chapters, many of the systems of tone change that are
found in the language. But it must be remembered that any rule formulated for tonal
behaviour only holds good “‘all things being equal”. To say this is not to invalidate the rule.
It is, rather, to say that if something is, for instance, added to an utterance of which the
grammatical relations and their expression by tone have been described, there may be achange in the tone patterns even though the original grammatical relations remain unaltered.
We say, for example, that after Subject Verb Form II, main, noun objects of tone group I
retain their inherent tones. Example:O zvola dla “He has bought some land”.","[197, 198]"
"This sensitivity of tone to every kind of grammatical relation, and not only to that of
dependence*), is of special interest to structural linguistics, with its focus on the relations
between units. “Ferdinand de Saussure may in many respects be considered the founder of
the modern science of language. He too was the first to call for a structural approach to
language, i. e. a scientific description of language in terms of relations between units’). In
a tone language like Igbo a linguistic unit cannot be seized on or described except in some
relation. The lexical tones may be said to express relations of detachement. No doubt this
is also true where relations are expressed by word order. But it is not so manifest.
1) Depending on the lexical tone of the word in quostion. There are syneretisms of tone as there are
of inflexional morphemes in other languages, such as Latin, for instance.
*) This distinction can be seen by comparing the analysis of Text I into a hierarchy of dependences
(see p. 205) with the notes on ‘Text II (see p. 212).",[198]
"98treen/Igwe,Grammarof IgboWith the high tone verb it is unnecessary to give a further paradigm of the verb with high
tone suffix, since suffix and verb stem are on the same level. But the situation of the low
tone verb is rather more complex. As with the imperative and with Subject Verb Form I
subordinate,conditional, we find that, with an object, the tonal behaviour of the unsuffixedverb form is different from that of the verb form with suffix, ending on a high tone. In the
latter case, tone group I objects have their non-inherent tones. In the former this is not
possible for N. lh, with its non-inherent initial mid tone, so long as the verb form ends onalow tone. But we find a modification of the tonal behaviour of the verb form when an object
follows. We therefore give paradigms, with and without suffix, with pronoun objects. We
also give noun objects for the unsuffixed verb. Noun objects with the suffixed verb, with both
high and low tone verbs, will be found for the initiating form, which is the same in this
respect as the non-initiating').","[117, 118]"
"ChapterXVI. The Negative Verb Forms117Noun objects retain their inherent tones after V. h. and V. 1.
Many suffixes can be used with the imperative, negative, either in place of -la or together
with it. Examples are given below. The -ghi suffix does not appear to be used with this
form. If, for instance, in the place of O st wnu ajila anu “He says you are not to refuse meat’,
we had O si wunu ajught anu, the utterance would be interpreted as a question, ‘He saysdidn’t you refuse meat?’’ The form in the latter case would be Subject Verb Form I, main,
negative. Both this and the imperative, negative, form could, in these two examples, be used
unsuffixed, but only the context would show which form the speaker was intending. The
exclusion of the -ghi suffix from the imperative, and the use of the -/a suffix, lessens the ambi-guity of the form,
Examples with various suffixes:The -la suffix is optional.","[136, 137]"
"We find a variant tonal form in which tone group I objects retain their inherent
tones, as above, though the verb form no longer ends on a low tone. An example is
given below.

3. The Narrative Division of the Verb
Tn this much used verb form the ev verb stem has no prefix.
Its tone is high for high tone verbs and low for low tone verbs, except when the latter areunsuffixed and followed by certain objects. Whereas the Subject Verb Forms always have
a subject and the imperative often has one, the narrative is distinguished by the fact that
it has no subject. Example:with openvowelMgbé anyt gara ahya zug anureemanu’any}hurya(V-h.suffix in both instances) ‘When we went to market and bought meat andsold oil we saw him”. It may be said to be in co-ordinate relationship to the verb form it
follows since that verb form could, formally, be substituted for it,The narrative occurs only in clauses of incomplete utterance, and its tone level, in relation
to the last syllable of the preceding clause, involves the question of interclausal relations,as was also the case with Subject Verb Form II, main. When the narrative form of a high
tone verb occurs after a non-low syllable it is sometimes found on a higher tone level than
that syllable and bears a “higher than high” tone mark. This is usually the case when it
follows a main verb form, but not when it follows a subordinate form or when it immediately
follows the verbs of motion zga and ibyd. Its high tone is then level with the preceding syllable. This can be seen in the examples which are given below of these various syntacticalsituations. But it must also be borne in mind that even after a main verb form the narrative
clause will not have the “‘higher than high” tone level if its clause is final and if it expresses
close continuity with the action of the main verb form. Thus we find Agara ii ahya, ‘gaa
or “I went to market and went (also) to the farm”. But Agara m ahya gaa ory “I went to
the farm via the market’’. In the same way we get, Agard m ahya, ’zuo anu “T went to market,and I bought meat’. Here the two actions are, as it were, distinct. But in Agard m ahya zuo
an they are closely connected?).
Manysuffixes are found with this form, but not the -ra (time) suffix, so far as has beenobserved. The open vowel suffix frequently occurs.",[131]
"It is di n’ulowhich is substitutable by an adjective and which must be considered the adjectival clause.
The limited, adjectival nature of these clauses can be scen very clearly in the first example
where di n’uld is anchored to the preceding syllable by its mid tone, which, as we have seen previously, is tonally non-existent except after a preceding high tone. Noun clauses, on theother hand, have a variety of syntactical behaviour that adjectival clauses, like adjectives,
do not
A further noteworthy point about adjectival clauses is that they are so intimately bound
up with the construction in which they occur that that construction, in many cases, could
not stand formally unaltered without them. In the first example, if di n’ulo is removed, the
tone pattern of anu will be modified and we shall get And di mma “The meat is good”,
because a low, or high falling to low, tone is required before a Subject Verb Form I, main.",[194]
"Chapter II
TonologyFollowing the definition of Dr. Pike we may say that a tone language is one in which
contrastive pitch levels do not merely form the intonation tune of a sentence as, for instance,
in English, but enter as distinctive factors into the lexical elements of the language, and in
some languages, of which Igbo is one, into the grammar as well.
It has also been suggested by Dr. Pike!) that, on the basis of our present knowledge, tone
languages may be divided into two main types, the register-tone type with level tonemes of
contrastive pitch and the contour-tone type with contrastive glides of pitch. A language may
be predominantly of one type or the other but may yet have occasional features of the other
type.",[26]
"Chapter XVIT
The Auxiliary Verb
We have only found one true auxiliary verb. It has the stem na and is always followed by
a participle, as in O na dazu anu “He is (was) buying meat)” or “He buys (bought)
meat’.
Fullverbssuchasigad“togo”,or ijt “tohave,hold’,can be usedas auxiliariesfollowed by the participle, either immediately or, as is never the case with the true auxiliary,

auxiliary is usually followed by the infinitive in the Ohuhw dialect, as in 0 ga izk anu “Ho

:XIIIntroductionWe try, throughout, to see the language as a whole and the grammatical facts in relation
to the series of systems within systems within which they occur.) Only thus can the subtle,
large scale oppositions be appreciated and the relations between apparently remote facts
grasped. What increases the difficulty of setting clearly before the reader the outlines of the
grammatical system of Igho is the fact that lexical elements — suffixes and a lexical prefix*)
— may be, and usually are, added to the grammatical forms, particularly in the verbal
system, modifying their meanings, though not their grammatical form, and thus suplement-ing the somewhat slender resources of the grammar. This marked characteristic of the language
would seem to be of interest for comparative and general linguistics.","[17, 18]"
"Sentence Analysis into Clauses
If we look at our text we shall find a number of single clause sentences, that is to say, of
sentences containing only one verb form. Hach of these is a complete utterance. Sentence 10,for instance, is an example, Mgbé dura ob? ojod na éme ywa & “The child was always sad”.
Sentence19 is another, aékwe,“They agreed”. Sentences22, 36, 38, 40, 43, 53, 61, arefurther examples.
We shall also find many two clause sentences where division can only be into the clause
of complete utterance and the remaining clause. The immediate constituents are, in fact, atonce apparent. Thus sentence 2 divides into the clause of complete utterance, O mara mma
jke ukwu, and a co-ordinate clause, ‘tofitakwa madhy. Sentence 5 divides into the clause of
complete utterance, Ha dnaght ekwe, and a noun clause, ka ezi dt byara ya. Other exampleswill be found in the text and in the chapter on clauses‘).
We find, however, many sentences of more than two clauses. We start always by taking
the formally independent part of the sentence, the clause of complete utterance, as one part
at our first division. On the principle of dividing into as few parts as possible we take the
rest of the sentence as our second part whenever the clauses composing it are interdependent.
This is the case in sentences 18, 21, 35, 37 and 66 for example. If we look at 37 we see that it
divides into the clause of complete utterance (C.C. U.), Akika afzisia, and the rest of the

"118Green/Igwe,Grammar of IgboThere is, however, with pronoun subjects only, another tonal form in the negative, which
we may call Tone Formii. In this, both pronoun and prefix are on low tones. The tone ofthe verb stem is high for both high and low tone verbs. It is followed, in accordance with
the typical negative tone pattern, by another syllable on a mid or a low tone. Whether it is
mid or low depends on the tonal conjugation of the verb, the inherent tone of the suffix, and
the presence or absence of object. With a non-compound verb this syllable will be one of the
suffixes, and -ghi is frequently used. Example: Any? azughi anu (V.h.) ‘We didn’t buy meat’.
The low tone suffix -bd is often found also. Example: O cibo akhu (V.h.) “He hasn’t yet
taken away the nuts’’, But with a compound verb an extra syllable is supplied by the second
verb stem. Thus, with the compound verb imeéechi, ““to shut’’, we find, Anyi emechighi anya“We didn’t shut our eyes’. The -ghz (-ghi) is optional, the tone pattern being complete
without it'). This is not the case with a simple verb. The suffix appears to be required as a
tone bearing syllable.","[137, 138]"
"As for the relations between nominals and verbs, we have seen in the verb chapters that
not only is subject and object relationship expressed but it is differently expressed, tonally,
for different verb forms. Moreover it is not only tonally expressed in the noun. The low, or
high falling to low, tone required on the syllable immediately preceding a Subject Verb

"It ean be scen clearly, also, in the tonal behaviour, for instance, of two nouns in genitival
relationship. ‘Two nouns which have high high tones lexically, tsi “head”? and eghu “‘goat’’,have the tone pattern, isi eghu “goat’s head’, when they are in genitival relationship.
Only in the verb are grammatical relations phonetically, or segmentally, expressed.
Elsewhere, and also in the verb except for its inflexional vowel prefix, grammatical relationsare expressed by tone and word order. This will become clear as the grammatical system of
the language is examined.
There is also what may be called an intonational factor in Igbo. Certain minor modifications
of the grammatical tone patterns may at times be made for emotional reasons. Exampleswill be found in the verb chapters.",[28]
"The adjectives are distinguished from the other parts of speech both by their tonal and
syntactical behaviour. They are only found immediately following a noun, pronoun or otheradjective. If a noun qualified by a pronoun is also qualified by an adjective, the adjectives
of the first two groups can either precede or follow the pronoun. The demonstratives follow
the pronoun.

"A complete utterance may, as has been said, consist of one word. Such words will include
exclamations and linked utterances of the question and answer type. Or the complete utterance may consist of a group of words, a phrase, used in the same way. If the group ofwords contains a verb form we call it a clause. A clause may be a complete utterance of the
linked type for which a single word is formally substitutable. Or it may be found within amulticlausal sentence as an incomplete utterance for which, again, a single word or part of
speech is substitutable. We then call it a clause of incomplete utterance. But a clause which
is a complete unlinked type of utterance, for which no single word is formally substitutable,
we call a clause of complete utterance.*) In Part I, where a text is analysed in units ofdescending order, many clauses of this kind will be described by analytic definition as constituents of the more complex unit of the multiclausal sentence. Once formally identified in
this manner it will be seen that they can also occur as isolated complete utterances.",[31]

level. But comparative and general linguistics must always be kept in mind and we believethat Igbo has a contribution to make to them. Our knowledge of the tone languages of West
Africa is still very limited. Moreover, in his account of tone languages in general,!) Dr. Pike
does not record any with a mid tone of the particular kind found in Igbo, with the stresses
it sets up in the grammatical system through its occurence only in relation to a precedinghigh tone.
It is sometimes debated whether the study of a language should proceed from the largest
units to the smallest or in the opposite direction.?) We follow Dr. Haas in recognizing thatthe “total utterance” or sentence, is the datum from which all lingustic research must set:
out and to which it must return.) In what order the component units of such data are ex-plored would appear to be largely a matter of convenience.
As to the order of exposition, in this book we have first described the units from smaller
to larger, giving a brief account at the phonological level in so far as it is necessary for anunderstanding of the grammar. At the grammatical level we go on, in our first part, to
describe the grammatical system, still in ascending order, from morphemes to multiclausalsentences. In the second part we reverse the process and analyse a complete text from larger
to smaller units, from sentences, through descending levels, to morphemes.!) The “system’’ —la langue — is thus seen in action in the “‘text’’ — la parole —, and the text is explained by
reference to the system,°) each validating the other. In this way, too, the examples in Part Iare contextualised in a way which would be quite impracticable for each in its systematic
position.°)

Igbo is a language of West Africa spoken by about five million people in South Eastern
Nigeria’). It has many dialects, and the first essential for a deseription of the grammar suchas we have attempted here is that it should be confined to one dialect. It may then serve
as a possible basis for a comparative study of the others. The dialect we examine here is spoken
near Umuahia by the people known as Ohuhu?). Our analysis is based chiefly on the speechof three speakers living within a few miles of each other in this dialect area, all young and
travelled men and thus tending to speak their dialect, not in the “deep’’ version that would
be used among the older people, but in a rather more general form. All have a good knowledge
of English and have had a higher Western Edueation, and all have had some training in
the study — which is quite a different thing from the speaking — of their own language. We
have all, with various interruptions,been working on this dialect sinceLinguistic research is always on the horns of a dilemma.","[18, 19]"

a wide range of syntactical behaviour within the clause, and this, together with the tonal
behaviour involved, is set out in the following chapters. Wegive here simple examples ofnouns in their various grammatical relationships.

verb form given. With different tone classes and other verb forms the tone patterns will be
different: The detailed tonal behaviour of the nouns will only become intelligible when it is
seen as part of a systematic whole.

"The parts of speech are described in the following chapters, but their minimal differential
criteria,theminimumof characteristicsthatdistinguishthemfromeachother, canbevery briefly set, out first.
Verbs are distinguished from all other parts of speech in being the only one with which
an inflexional affix is found. This affix is a vowel prefix. This is the only instance of inflexion
phonologically, or segmentally, expressed. All other inflexion in the verb and all inflexion in
the other parts of speech, is tonally, or suprasegmentally, expressed. *)Nominals— nouns, pronouns, numeralssyntactical behaviour, much of which is common— are distinguished by a wide range of
to them, and by much tonal inflexion.*)Nouns are minimally distinguished from pronouns by the fact that in a linked utterance of the question type not initiated by an interrogative, the subject of the verb mustbe a pronoun, or a pronoun following a noun in apposition. It cannot be a noun alone.
Numerals are distinguished from pronouns in the same way, and from nouns by a
special tonal inflexion in genitivalrelationship.",[32]
"“TI did it?”, The pronouns are on high tones throughout,both monosyllabicand disyllabie.
As with other parts of speech, the grammatical relations of the pronouns are expressed by
tone and word order.
Pronouns oceur in many of the same syntactical situations as nouns. The tonal behaviour
of the disyllabic pronouns is, however,distinct from that of the disyllabic nouns.",[53]
"Green/Igwe,24Grammarof Igho5. Nouns in Subject Relationship to the Verb
In Igbo the noun immediately preceding?) the imperative or one of the Subject Verb
Forms may be said to be the subject of the verb if a pronoun is formally substitutable. This
grammatical relationship is expressed not only by word order but by tone. In the chapters
on the verb the tonal behaviour of the noun subjectshasbeenset outin detail,andassuch it presents a somewhat formidable appearance. But when it is seen as a whole the
system becomes apparent. In some verb forms all noun subjects retain their inherent tones,
In those where they do not, tone group I nouns take non-inherent tones in a certain set ofcircumstances and tone group II nouns in a different set.
The tonal behaviour of noun subjects in the non-auxiliary verb forms may be set out as
follows:
In the imperative and imperative negative, noun subjects retain their inherent tones.
In the Subject Verb Forms:a) Noun subjects retain their inherent tones in the main forms with vowel prefix, i. e.
Subject Verb Form II, main and Subject Verb Form I, main, negative, and in two subordinate forms, Subject Verb Form I, subordinate, conditional, and Subject Verb
FormI, subordinate, conditional, negative.b) Noun subjects have a tone falling to low or a low tone on their final syllable in the
main forms without vowel prefix. Tone group II noun subjects retain their inherent
tones. Tone group I noun subjects take non-inherent tones as follows:
The final syllable falls to low in Subject Verb Form I, main. Examples: N hh,
Egh@ tara ji “The goat ate the yam”. Nlh. Oké tard ji “The rat ate the yam”’.?)
Both syllables are low in Subject Verb Form II, main, negative. Example: N hh.","[43, 44]"
