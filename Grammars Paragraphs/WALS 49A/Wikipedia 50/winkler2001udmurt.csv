"ZUNOMINALCASEMORPHOLOGY2. Accusative: 0, -ez, -jez, -iz ~ -ti, -e/-es(23)2.1 The accusative is the case of the direct object of transitive verbs. The accusative without a
suffix is used, if the object is indefinite, whereas the other the suffixes -ez, -jez, -iz ~ -ti appear,
if the object is definite. According to the common definition the following constituents are
definite: personal names, personal pronouns, nouns with a PX, all constituents nominalized by
the suffix identical with PX 3SG and nouns with appropriate attributes (demonstrative
pronouns, adjectives, numerals, marked with DEF); the context, too, can determine the definite-ness of a constituent. In principle this definition is valid for pluralic direct objects too, but
definiteness is not as clear-cut as for singular constituents. As a rule the unmarked accusativemonknigalid3-iIbook(-ACC)read-PRET/1SGmon(ta)khiga-jezDEMbook-ACC(20)Istreet-ELmaliciousdog-ACC/nice house(-ACC)see-PRET/1SGis used if the object itself is focused, whereastheunmarked is employed if the action itself bears the logical accent.
2.2 Adjunets of time, distance etc. appear in ther accusative too; in such cases the verb need not
be transitive:

a wider sense. In this case the governing constituent bears a corresponding PX:Lenin jegit-jos-li

As mentioned above (see nominative) even the mere nominative serves as a possessive modifier. The difference between the possessive modifier in the NOM and in the GEN is that by the
help of the former a general relation is expressed whereas with the latter a concrete object isval-m-eshulesk-imeant:horse-1PL-ACCforest-ILL leave-PRET-1PLjua-§-ez-liotvetask-PART-NOMIN-DATanswer(-ACC)Sot-i-z

However, there are cases in which definiteness in the narrow sense does not explain the use of
the marked accusative. Definiteness seems to be connected with other semantic categories like(27) — nilderemgirldressvs(27°)nil-lenderem-ezgirl-GENdress-3SG‘a (concrete) dress of a (concrete) girl’‘girl’s dress’resultativity, totality or animacy (Konaparsepa 2000):If in the so-called habeo-construction - like most Finno-Ugric languages Udmurt has no verb
with the meaning ‘to have’ - the possessor is explicitly expressed, this adnominal constituent(21)also appears in the genitive:mon

In certain constructions the agent usually appears only in the form of PX agglutinated to
nominal verb forms. If the possessor is explicitly expressed (for contrastive reasons), this
constituent is used in the genitive, too:22(29)NOMINALminam Si-jem-eCASEMORPHOLOGYpot-eI-GEN eat-PART-1SG(36)_ leave-PRS/3SGee Zit(-ges)litr-le§¥

The last example reveals another function of the definite suffix, namely a kind of partitive;
literally ‘of the people much’.

Apart from word stems and affixes there are some clitics like -a (marker of yes/no-questions).
The order of stem and affixes is the following: (prefix) - stem - derivational suffix(es) - inflexional suffix(es) - clitic. Suffixes of the same type (case, number, possession) can occur in a morpheme sequence even twice, namely on the one hand in certain constructions - either pleonastically (for example til-e-d-li ‘you (PL; DAT)’ with e and /i marking the dative) or of a
different kind (for example ul-lan-e ‘downwards’, with /ari marking the approximative and e the
illative) - or on the other hand depending on contextual conditions (cf. 2.4.4.4 und 2.3.5).
On the whole, Udmurt is highly synthetic, the existence of analytical expressions is very limited.
2.2 Parts of speech
Udmurt nouns and verbs usually differ from each other (but cf. 2.1), as do the corresponding
derivational and inflexional (except possessive suffixes and personal suffixes, which are almost
identical) suffixes. Cases like mertéem ‘splinter; it went into [PERF]; has gone into [PART]’ are2.3.1.1 NumberUdmurt has two numbers, singular and plural. The singular has no own marker, that of the plural
is jos ~ os, the first after consonants, the second after vowels, gurt-jos ‘villages’, gurez-jos
‘hills’, w-jos ‘nights’ and korka-os ‘houses’, kidil'i-os ‘stars’2
The plural often remains unexpressed, if it is deducible from the context, as(7)pi-jezvanson-3SGEX/PRS‘She has a son/sons’
After numerals and quantifiers the singular is used as well, vit’ ad’ami ‘five men’, tros pol
“many times’; sometimes the plural occurs in such cases, which might be a young phenomenon
(perhaps due to Russian influence).
There are no pluralia tantum in Udmurt, but singularia tantum like vej ‘butter’, Zuzdala ‘height’
or expressions for paired things like Sin ‘eye, eyes’, kuas ‘ski, skies’; if the single thing has to bevery sporadic.",[9]

c) Portmanteau-suffixes, i. e. a suffix has more than one function at the same time: min-o (FUT/
1SG) ‘I shall go’, min-i (PRET/1SG) ‘I went’ or particularly the PX/3SG.
d) Zero morphemes: A category is expressed by the form of the word itself (i. e. without a
separate suffix), for example the nominative in general, the accusative of the indefinite object,
the dative of the personal pronouns (1SG minim ‘to me’ can only historically be analysed into
the stem min- and a PX/1SG) or the preterite of the stems ending in a.
The parts of speech usually have their own suffixes. There are however some suffixes occurring
in more than one part of speech, for example:
1) The PX/3SG -()ez is a nominalizer too. Almost every form of a word can be transformed into
a noun with the help of this suffix (cf. Alatyrev 1970), for example(1)tonponna-jezyoubecause of/POSTP-/NOMIN‘who/which is because of you’(2)vuza-no-jez
sell-PART-NOMIN‘which is to be sold’

particles as, for example, kad” ‘like’:RE en ee Aa“:(3)ee ONEne ee eee eeeeeseren-joston-enyou-INSTRWithin the area of the nouns the boundary is not as clear.

by the frequentative -al- (the -/- is preserved in the PRS 3PL). Morphologically these two stemsThe basis can be a declined noun (ton-en-ez ‘that, which is with you’, INSTR from ‘you’),
adverbs (like tatié-ez ‘that, which is from there’), postpositional syntagms (like ton ponna-jez
‘that, which is for you’, ponna ‘for’) and infinite verbal forms (like vuza-no-jez ‘that which is todiffer from each other: the a-stems always keep the stem-vowel (= -a), whereas in the i-stems
the alternations i ~ i ~ 0 occur:
:
a) The stem vowel disappears, when the anlaut of the suffix is a vowel: *mini-o > mino ‘I shall
i> V,/_#V, (-).be sold’, s. 2.4.5.2).go’:2) Deverbal categorizers only form substantives, like -on/-n (verask-on ‘conversation’ from
veraskini ‘to talk’; rarely used as adjectives too), -ef (jurtt-et ‘help’ from jurttini ‘to help’) or
-em/-m (puk-em ‘chair’ from pukini ‘to sit’); this last form is identical with the ending of thebefore non-palatal C j: mini-mte-jez ‘they say that he has not gone’; mini-sal ‘I would go’;
gozti-ti-ni ‘to let write’).participle perfect. There is no semantic difference between these two forms, but a syntactical:
While the participle form retains its government pattern, the deverbal derived substantive
behaves like a real noun in the sense that it governs only adnominal modifiers in the genitive. In
practice the difference is not always clear.
3) Denominal categorizers to a larger extent form adjectives - like -o (kuzZmo ‘strong’ from kuZim ‘strength’), -tem (vutem ‘without water’ from vu ‘water’) - and some substantives, like -/ik
(tazalik ‘health’ from taza ‘healthy’; suffix borrowed from Tatar). The suffix -jos identical with
the plural marker forms collective nouns, even from declined nouns like as-me-len-jos ‘those
who belong to us’ (reflexive pronoun + 1PL + GEN + COLL).
There are no morphological means for marking the categories equative, diminutive and aug-b) The stem-vowel changes into i before a suffix with initial palatal C (= § [):i> i/ #5(-) (butThe traditional approach says that there are two stems, a longer one with this -i and a shorter
one without this j (and i as part of the following suffix).
Udmurt has no conjugateable verb ‘to be’, but only two petrified forms of it, the preterital form
val and the form of the participle vilem also expressing modal nuances. These two forms are
also used as a kind of an existential verb, which has a corresponding form of the present: var.8
The negative forms are: present evel, preterite ej val and participle vilem evel resp. vilimte.

A finite verb-form is marked for the cate-youwelllive-PRS/1SGgories tense/mood and for person/number in agreement with the subject; there is no morphological finite passiv. These four categories are not limitlessly compatible with each other.
Besides the morphologically marked categories there are also those marked with the help oflit. “I live well having you’2.4 Verbal morphologyderivative or lexical means (2.4.5 and 2.4.2.2).
The main categories are synthetically formed. The order of these categories is the following:
(stem) - tense/mood - person (- number). Analytically formed are certain tense- and mood-forms
(by means of particles = infinite auxiliary verbs) and all negative forms (with the help of a
negative verb).
The infinite verbal forms are synthetically formed. They are used in functions typically fulfilled
by other parts of speech: participles (used as noun modifiers), gerunds (verbal adverbs),
infinitive and action nominals (verbal nouns).","[23, 24]"
"The personal pronoun of the 3rd person, identical with the demonstrative pronoun, is inflected

(3) Structures containing a participle can have different functions depending on the kind of

attribute to a constituent of the higher sentence. Time reference is the same as in the higherDifferent time reference can be inherent to the verbal form or expressed by appropriate postpositions.

personal name, a noun etc., it appears additionally and is marked by GEN.

‘still, yet’ (following), twz ‘very’, -ges (added to nouns) ‘just’ ete.

b) sentence-final or in the middle after a constituent: ke ‘if; when’; ke no ‘although’ (actually‘even though’); gine (no) ‘as soon as’;
c) sentence-initial: ugos, mali ke Suono ‘because’ (lit. ‘if why to say’).",[33]

Examples of the function:The genitive form is used for emphasizing the possessive relation:
korka-jeas-lam(88)2.3.2.5 Interrogative/relative pronounsThe most important interrogatives are simple words. Udmurt has the following inventory: kin
‘who (persons)’, ma, mar ‘what (non-persons)”*, kiée ‘what kind’, kud ‘which’ and kena ‘howmuch’; compounded: kud-iz (with DEF) ‘which’ and kud-mi, kud-di, kud-zi ‘which of us/you/
them’ (with PX1PL/2PL/3PL). Ma, mar are free variants. The use of kud (without DEF) is very
restricted (for example kud palas ‘from which side’).
The non-compounded interrogatives decline like nouns (for example kin-e (ACC), kin-len
(GEN), ma(r)-li (DAT), ma-in/mar-en (INSTR)), kud-iz is declined like an adjective + DEF and
the other compounded interrogatives follow the pattern of nouns with corresponding PX. Again
only the grammatical cases of kin are in use.house-1SGExamples:“my own house’(92)Pro-adjective functions:

3) The PX with -i- (instead of -e-) appear:

example ket-i ‘my stomach’, vin-id ‘your sister’;
b) after the plural marker, e5-jos-iz ‘his/her friends’.
4) The 1SG has its own (historically primary) suffix -7 in some oblique cases. In the accusative
this m follows directly after the stem resp. the plural marker: e§-m-e ‘my friend (ACC)’, e5-josm-e ‘my friends (ACC)’.
In all the other persons the consonant alone is used (voiceless obstruent after voiceless consonant) followed by the accusative suffix which differs in the SG from the PL: e-/-e ‘your friend

3.3.2.1.2 AsyndetonThis kind of subordination is connected with verba dicendi. Usually the object of these verbs
appears as indirect speech in a subordinate clause with the conjunction Suisa (s, 3.3.2.1.1). But
their object can be a clause of direct speech embedded in the higher sentence without conjunctions. As a rule the clause of the direct speech (as the object) is positioned directly in front of the
verbum dicendi. The order of the subordinate clause as well as the expression of its subject is
the same like in the unembedded case.",[39]
"1.4 Stress
The stress is of the quantitative-dynamic type and generally falls on the last syllable. In inflected
words it is always the inflexional suffixes that are stressed, never the stem itself (see below).
That means, depending on the length of the suffix order different suffixes are stressed: uknd
‘window’, ukno-ds ‘windows’ (PL), ukno-os-si ‘their windows’ (3PL), ukno-os-si-lén ‘of their
windows’ (GEN), ukno-os-si-len-éz ‘that of their windows’ (NOMIN) etc.
A stressed syllable is somewhat longer than an unstressed one. Other suprasegmental components (sound intensity, tone height) separate from fall on the first syllable (Baitchura 1973:
86f.).
Exceptions from the above mentioned rule are the following:
1) Verbal forms of the IMP 2SG/PL: véra ‘say!’, vérale (PL) ‘say!’; in the periphrastically built
forms of the 3SG/PL (cf. 2.4.2.2) the particle preceding the verbal form bears the stress: méd
minoz ‘let him/her go’.
2) Negative verbal forms (cf. 2.4.3): mon ug todiski/ug tédi/ej tédi ‘1 don’t know/won’t
know/didn’t know’ (except the sc perfect). In negative forms of the IMP 2SG/PL the stress falls
either on the preceding particle or on the first syllable of the verb: én vera ~ en véra ‘don’t1.5 Morphonology
1.5.1 SyncopeA word with the structure (C)VCVC shows syncope of an unstressed j (rarely o or e) in the
second syllable preceded and/or followed by a liquid or a nasal (sometimes plosives), when a
vowel-initial suffix is added and the word structure would result in a sequence of three (or
more) open syllables, cf. kuzijm ‘strength’ + adjective-forming suffix -o > kuzmo ‘strong’ or
turin ‘hay’ + verb-forming suffix -a- + INF -ni > turnani ‘to cut’, gibed ‘reat’ > gibdani
“smoulder’.
1.5.2 Paragogic consonantsIn some nouns with a final consonant in the nominative a k, m or f is inserted before a suffix
with an initial vowel: /iules ‘forest’, nulesk-in ‘in the forest’, but rules-mi ‘our forest’; um‘sleep’, umm-e ‘my sleep’, but um-tek ‘without sleep’; kik ‘two’, kikt-eti ‘second’, but kik-li ‘to
two (DAT)’. Exceptions: kik-e ‘my two’, riules-e ‘my forest’.
Historically the forms with the paragogic consonant represent the older state (with the exception
of some analogical forms): After the decline of the final vowel the consonant cluster in the
medial position came to be in the final position and the last part of the cluster declined (for
example in the nominative),

"0.1 Socio-and geolinguistic situation
Udmurt belongs to the Permian branch of the Uralic language family. Its closest linguistic
relative is Komi; the two languages are not mutually intelligible. Udmurt is the self-designation
(older name: Votyak).
According to the last census (1989), 747.000 people declared themselves to be of Udmurt
nationality. Of these approximately 520.000 (= c. 70%) speak Udmurt as their mother tongue.
About two thirds (c. 496.500) of the Udmurts live in the Udmurt Republic (Udmurtia; 1.609.000
inhabitants; 42.000 km?; capital: Izhevsk/Izhkar, 650.000), which forms a part of the RussianFederation and is located between the Vyatka and the Kama Rivers. The Udmurts are thus a
minority within their own republic (c. 31%, Russians 59%, Tatar 7%), although in the rural
areas they form the majority. One third lives outside the Udmurt Republic, mainly in the neighbouring republics of Bashkiria (c. 24.000) and Tatarstan (c. 25.000) and in the Kirov (c. 22.000)
and Perm region (c. 32.000); the remaining 150.000 Udmurts live in scattered settlements in the
former Soviet Union, chiefly in cities. While the former groups of Udmurts have preserved their
language very well, the mother-tongue speakers in the latter groups are already in the minority
and will probably become completely russified.
Usually the Udmurts are bi-, even trilingual. The second language is generally Russian, the third
Tatar. Russian is the language of the cities, of the administration and the official life, of themass media and traffic, while Udmurt is the language of the countryside, the family and agriculture. The younger generation speaks better Russian than the older, the older better Udmurt
than the younger. Extensive code-switching to Russian (phrases, semi-sentences, proverbs) can
be observed very often and is not always connected with the subject-matter, which may be better
expressed in Russian. Not seldom the reason is carelessness, an attitude depending on theI would like to thank R. Nohr (Freising), V. Napolskikh and N. Borlukova (Izhevsk), M. Geisler

In the Udmurt Republic only in a part of the schools (in 360 schools with about 31.100 pupils,
that makes about a third of Udmurts of school age) is Udmurt teaching language and school

"OZOTHER GRAMMATICALCLASSESCONJUNCIIONSThis group can be divided in subgroups with the help of syntacto-semantical criteria. This
classification implies that a lexeme can belong to different groups, depending on the position in
the clause. BauSev (1929: 36) mentions, for example: min al’i ‘go on!” (al’i here modal particle)
vs alii min ‘go now!’ (al’i here adverb of time). But there are cases in which a lexeme has
different functions in the same position and one can decipher the meaning only with the help of
the context (examples from BauSev):

yal weakening the illocutionary force of imperative sentences, ojdo (following) giving an
encouraging nuance to the illocutionary force of imperative sentences, etc.
c) Sentence/epistemic and attitudinal adverbials expressing the speaker’s attitude to the content
of the sentence: olo, /ega ‘perhaps, probably’, dir ‘probably’, pe ‘they say’, kad’ ‘it seems’ etc.
d) Indicators of the sentence type: the enclitics -a, -fe indicate a yes/no interrogative sentence.
e) Others: ben, o-o ‘yes’, evel ‘no’; tani ‘there, here’ (russ. vor), ut’ ‘behold!’, iske ‘so’ etc.
