Of course it i s always possible t o define it semantically ( r e c i p i e n t ,
benefactive) but t h i s i s without s y n t a c t i c consequences..
Leaving now t h e discussion of t h e f e a s i b i l i t y of a universally s i g n i f i c a n t
Is t h e r e
category ' I O ' , what i s t h e language s p e c i f i c s i t u a t i o n i n Imonda?

I t appears t h a t NPs whose
r e f e r e n t s a r e r e c i p i e n t s o r b e n e f i c i a r i e s p a t t e r n l i k e peripheral NPs but a l s o
have some core NP properties.
There i s c l e a r l y no j u s t i f i a b l e s y n t a c t i c

Let us now see how t h e s y n t a c t i c handling of
t h e prime candidates f o r I 0 s t a t u s , namely r e c i p i e n t and beneficiary, compares
with t h a t of t h e core and p e r i p h e r a l NPs.
In chapter 4 we have seen t h a t case
marking s i g n a l s the semantic function of peripheral NPs and t h a t these
p e r i p h e r a l NPs do not stand i n a p a r t i c u l a r s y n t a c t i c r e l a t i o n t o t h e
predicate.
Furthermore, none of those p e r i p h e r a l NPs i s cross-referenced on
the verb.
This i s i n c o n t r a s t t o t h e two core NPs, s u b j e c t and o b j e c t , which
a r e cross-referenced on t h e verb f o r non-singular number and a r e not case
marked, i n t h e case of s u b j e c t , o r ' o p t i o n a l l y ' s o i n the case of object.
AS
pointed out, t h e semantic function of t h e two core NPs i s dependent on t h e verb
and not indicated by morphosyntactic means.
Core and p e r i p h e r a l NPs are
t h e r e f o r e c l e a r l y d i s t i n c t i n a number of ways.

"1.5.1 A note on the use of glosses
The problem of choosing appropriate glosses for morphemes is a thorny one and
the solution adopted in this grammar may not be the best one.
Where a given
morpheme fulfils one function or a few very closely related functions, there
is no problem and we may use a consistent gloss.
Thus, the verbal prefix eis simply a subject number marker (dual) and never performs another function.
Often, however, what is clearly one and the same morpheme has various functions
and the question arises whether we should use different glosses accordingly.
If we do so in principle, then the further question is how different the
This is
individual functions have to be for us to choose different glosses.
where the difficulty lies.
Thus, the verbal suffix -na agrees with benefactives and possessors and these two functions could arguably be indicated by
different glosses.
On the other hand, the case marker -m has a host of
functions (7.3) the central one of which is that of goal marker.
Other
functions are more or less closely related to the one of goal marking and there
seems to be no non-arbitrary cut-off point for introducing new glosses. Besides
goal, -m marks recipients and benefactives, which may be regarded as goals,
objects that actually are goals, but it also functions as a disambiguator,
marking all [+~uman]objects.
It seems best to use just one gloss for all
these cases.
This has the additional advantage that we do not have to invent
glosses for those occurrences of -m where its function is entirely opaque (for
examples see chapter 7).
Therefore, one gloss is normally used for a given morpheme throughout this
grammar. Where this results in total obscurity, the reader is referred to the
index, which provides references to the appropriate places, where the functions
of these morphemes are discussed. Occasionally, and possibly inconsistently, I
have abandoned the principle of 'one gloss per morpheme'. Thus, the goal marker
sometimes substitutes for the locative marker and in this function it is
glossed accordingly (i.e. LQC); or the suffix - i a has the two distinct
functions of marking location and cause and it is glossed according to itsp a r t i c u l a r f u n c t i o n a s e i t h e r UX: o r CAU.
Apart from such minor exceptions,
however, t h e p r i n c i p l e of 'one g l o s s p e r morpheme' has been maintained
throughout t h i s grammar.","[13, 14]"

Pronouns may be divided i n t o four categories on semantic and formal grounds.

Those t h a t may not take case marking typically function as scene s e t t i n g

A l l of these dependent nouns have become s o fused with t h e case marker t h a tthey may not be separated by anything.
The i n t e n s i f i e r s , f o r instance, which
normally precede case marking when they determine a noun (3.3.21, follow case
marking with t h e above nouns.

Some adjectives derive adverbs by means of the c l i t i c -nam ( 3 . 2 . 6 ) .
Both the

the rule that adjectives have t o follow the noun.
For instance, the
adjective abka-1 small, which above i s seen occurring before tetoad bird, may
also occur a f t e r the noun:
(140) tetoad abka - 1
bird
small-NOM
small bird
However, it i s not the case that abka-1 may occur before any noun:
(141) *abka - 1

small -NOM pig
1 shoot-PER
I have shot a small pig
In f a c t , there i s a meaning difference between abka-1 tetoad and tetoad abka-1.
In the f i r s t case, with the adjective preposed, the referent must be one from
among those species o f birds t h a t are inherently small.
In the second case,
any bird t h a t happens t o be small may be the referent. Let us look a t
another example :
(142) f o

banana ripe-NOM
ripe banana
However,
The referent o f f o abu-1 may be any banana that happens t o be ripe.
with the adjective preposed, i . e . abu-l f o r the referent i s one from among the
species o f bananas that are eaten when ripe, without there actually being a
need for it t o be ripe.","[58, 59, 60]"

In t h i s example n6f i s t h e object of f e and t h e case-marked NP (ne) i s the

"systematic analysis of discourse is outside the scope of this grammar.
However, certain phenomena of grammar cut across the traditionally strict
division between sentence and discourse level.
Thus, topicalised clauses
have 'sentential' and 'discourse' functions -anda complete account of this
phenomenon cannot be given without appealing to discourse.
Topic clauses
with sentential functions are contrastive topics and correspond to adverbial
clauses in English.
Those with discourse function are resumptive topics.
They 'summarise' the information contained in the previous clause and present
it as a topic, that is, as a framework against which the subsequent clause
needs to be interpreted. These resumptive topics simply provide a backreference to the preceding clause, provide discourse cohesion and cannot be
said to be subordinate to the following clause.
This pattern is well known
from Philippine languages (also from New Guinea languages).
AFormally, topic clauses are marked by a suffix on the verb.
The same suffix
may also mark adverbial and NP 'topics,both clause-internal and clauseexternal topics.
Topic marking might therefore be described at least at
three different levels, namely clause, sentence and discourse.
However, what
is clearly one and the same phenomenon needs to be given a unified treatment
and this is provided in chapter 9.","[12, 13]"

"HAIMAN'S POSITION
Haiman invokes t h e notion of universal morphology, by which he means t h a t
"" s i m i l a r i t i e s of form a r e r e f l e c t i o n s of underlying s i m i l a r i t i e s of meaning""
(Haiman 1978:586).
I n Hua, a Highlands language of Papua New Guinea, he notes
morphological s i m i l a r i t i e s between t h e marking of t o p i c and t h a t of t h e
p r o t a s i s i n conditional constructions.
H i s p r i n c i p l e of universal morphology
would suggest t h a t t o p i c marking and t h e p r o t a s i s have something i n common.

However,

D I K ' S POSITION
A d e f i n i t i o n of t o p i c t h a t is broader than t h e t r a d i t i o n a l one seems a l s oJapanese has t h e
c a l l e d f o r t o cover c e r t a i n much discussed phenomena.

While t h e t r a d i t i o n a l d e f i n i t i o n of t o p i c would be t o o r e s t r i c t i v e t o handle
examples of t h i s s o r t , Haiman's would be broad enough.
However, Dik o p t s f o r
a different solution.
He introduces t h e term theme t o cover example (23) ,
maintaining t o p i c f o r example ( 2 2 ) .
Dik proposes t h e following sentence
schema :(Theme) , Predication, ( T a i l )
clause) , preceded by an optional
theme and followed by an optional t a i l .
While t h e t a i l covers cases of
c l a r i f y i n g afterthought character, t h e theme covers t h e l e f t - d i s l o c a t i o n and
t o p i c a l i s a t i o n s t r a t e g i e s , i . e . those s t r a t e g i e s t h a t have scene s e t t i n g
function.
Both theme and t a i l a r e linked t o the predication by way of t h e
p r i n c i p l e of relevance.
So, f o r instance, a speaker confronted with:
' a s f o r Joan's lover, I had s p a g h e t t i on t o a s t again l a s t night' would t r y and
unravel the connection between t h e theme and t h e predication, n a t u r a l l y

There must be co-reference of the subjects of matrix and embedded clause.
