should be the same as the one of the pronoun to which the referential case marker is
suffixed. In this function

"91, 1011568.5.5.2 Participant orientationParticipant orientation in Una usually does not cause any problems due to the fact that
the agent obligatorily is encoded not only in the verb, but also optionally, but frequently,
in the form of a personal pronoun, proper noun or descriptive noun or noun phrase (cf.
Figure 43). Unlike other languages Una, with its very precise agent reference system in
the verb, does not give too many opportunities for ambiguities with respect to who is doing
what to whom. The information is usually clearly encoded.sun OkbabIn this expository discourse we notice individual and unitary reference. There is
group reference, either to individual centred groups (as in sentence 38
'the people who walked to Okbab'), or to collective groups in which no
individual stands out: (e.g. , sentences 32-36: 'they . . . all people'). Some groups are
partitionable into smaller groups; (e.g. sentences 38 and 1 63 : 'the Kerabuk people who
went to Okbab . . . they' and sentence 41 : 'Nginngin, Dinab and Etum . . . they all').baramnyi nangReference to conventi onal groups occurs often in this di scourse so that 'they'
automatically refers to the entire society of Langda of which the narrator is a part, and
where most events occurred.
A certain amount of referential shifting goes on; groups expand and contract. There
is also change in the scale with which the narrator views the otherslhimself without
changing membership ; e.g. in sentences 1 26-131 in which he refers to himself as being a
part of a groups of young children:
(
- talk not
big not . . .
small children . . . while-I­
grew-up) ' 1 did not say that . . . we were not big . . . we were small children . . . while I grew
up .. .'. As seen above, the narrator sometimes focuses on himself, sometimes on the
group, without apparent reason.... ni weyk kibmasibok mynuram
... wekum . . nun weyk
we kum ... nun mitik mabwaSometimes zero (0) identification occurs in certain environments, usually in rapid
speech near the discourse peaks which show a high degree of excitement. However, in
those cases the identity of the participants which are in focus is completely clear to the
audience (cf. sentences 66, 1 01 , 1 50, 1 51 and 1 69).","[165, 166]"
"THE MORPHOLOGY OF THE VERB2.1General remarks about Una verb inflectionThe intricate verb structure of Una is like that in other Papua New Guinea - Irian Jaya
languages, often comparable in role and cohesion features to the clause root. Not
infrequently a single verb form is a complete clause including agent and personal
objects as undergoer, scope or benefactee, and a significant proportion of verb inflection
signals relationships among verbs in sequence. In comparison with other languages it
is therefore rather difficult in Una to isolate morphology from syntax. The feature which
Wurm (1 969:81) calls 'one of the most striking characteristics' of highland New Guinea
languages is also true for Una: the occurrence of a clause containing an independent
sentence-final verb preceded by one or more clauses containing dependent sentence­
medial verbs marked to indicate switch reference (i.e. identity or non-identity of
grammatical subjects of the verb in the two clauses). This phenomenon of stringing
clauses together was labelled 'chaining' by McCarthy (1 965) - see also Capell (1 962:1 1 5)
and has been reported for an increasing number of languages in the New Guinea - Irian
Jaya area.
The dependent aspect verb final suffixes such as simultaneous and
simulfactive aspects mark respectively the same or different subjects of actions
occurring at the same time, and in doing so keep track of the participants of actions. The
anticipatory and preview aspects mark consecutive actions marked in verbs which are
found in sequence, sometimes even beyond the sentence boundary. This phenomenon
was also noticed in Telefol to the east of Una (cf. Healey 1 966) and in Dani to the west of
Una (cf. Bromley 1 9 72).

This kind of agglutinative verb root compounding is a characteristic feature of the
Una language. The whole range of syn tactic and lexical functions such as intentional
mode, etc., of this formation cannot be described in this work. They yield either new
lexemes o r they assume syntactic functions (cf. Louwerse 1982a). In the case of
compounding of three verb roots the last verb root is a verb of motion.","[25, 26, 27]"
"NON-VERBAL CATEGORIESA major morphological distinction exists between verbal and non-verbal structures.
The latter usually occur without suffixes, while the verb stem never occurs without a
suffix and usually has more than one. The non-verb stem in most cases stands alone as
a complete word, being a grammatically independent utterance.",[79]

"In the sample text only a few cases of performative information have been observed,

In these cases the relation of narrator to hearer

discourse states the explicit separation between the time of the speech event and the
happening. The same is true for the contents of sentence
'Their father

'I

time of the happening). Labov and Waletzky

suffix of an independent sentence final verb indicates an action which very
likely will happen as a result of the action described in the preceding clause. This
marker refers to potential events. Those events might have happened in the past but did
not. In that case the semantic opposition between potentional mode and irrealis is
neutralized. Alternatively, those events might still happen in the future but are not
explicitly predicted or ordered by the speaker, in which case the semantic opposition of
hypothetical mode to potential mode is neutralized. However, the hypothetical mode is
marked obligatorily on both the dependent sentence medial and the independent sentence
final verbs while the potential mode is marked by the

In order to avoid sentences of disproportionate length, when the medial-final chain

Una, as one of these languages, has chains of clauses with one, and only one clause
- usually the last - containing a distinct verb. We can, however, safely say that
clauses occur within sentences, paragraphs, and discourse, and that they are
chunks of different sizes.1982f).",[211]

device frequently used in Una discourse, especially in narrative discourse. In this
expository discourse it is frequently used in the first paragraph where part or all of the
preceding sentence is repeated in the onset of the next sentence in an Adverbial Clause.
The Adverbial Clause has the function of maintaining discourse perspective between
successive parts of the sentence and paragraphs relative to the discourse as a whole. The
tail-head linkage can also give a summary of previous actions, or it can imply a script­
like movement; e.g. 'come--pass by--go'. In this case the tail-head linkage does not need
to be exact. See for example sentences
and
'they two came' and
'they two p assed by and went', in which the latter is a continuation of the
movement from the viewpoint of the narrator. In Una oral and written presentation of
discourse (especially in narrative discourse) tail-head linkage is automatic, so that
every successive sentence which moves the event-line forward in a narrative paragraph
will have such a tail-head linkage. H owever, it seems typical for at least some Papua
New Guinea/Irian Jaya languages like Dani, Yali and Una, that the tail-head linkage
infrequently gives way in some of the successive units to another conjunction, or to
asyndeton (cf. Bromley
Fahner
and others). This same phenomenon is
reported in Philippine languages such as Taboli (Longacre
Thompson and
Longacre
The effect of this occasional elimination, or substitution of the
subordinating adverb, is that the independent clause now functions as tail-head linkage.",[169]

its use in the description of languages in general, but according to its use in some
descriptions of languages with comparable features, e.g. , Loving and McKaughan19
1964:3; Bromley 1972:562ff; Heeschen 1978:25; and Fahner 1979:43, 44. Grouping verbs
into these classes has proven to be valuable since it makes the description of many
categories more intelligible and shorter7• The criteria to distinguish these verb classes
from one another are in the form of two triplets8, verb suffixation and final consonants.

"8.5.2 Surface structure encoding of information
From the following display (cf. Figure 43) different kin ds of information about the
story of the helicopters are readily displayed. The form of this display is according to
Thurman-Grimes (1 975), and the full display can be found in Appendix A.
The vertical columns correspond to the various kinds of information distinguished in
the text: The events which happened are indicated by predications (including quotations
in the case of speech events, and the verbs of motion are in italics), identification (I.D.),
setting (8.), background (B.), collateral (C.), and performative (P.). To prevent
crowding of the chart the convention is used that information of a particular kind begins
under the corresponding heading, but may be carried as far to the right as needed.
The parallel vertical lines are for the participants; one line per participant. For each
real-world event a line i s drawn from the predication that represents the event to the
vertical lines that represent the participants in the event. Where identifications are
given for the participants, lines are drawn from the right hand side to show which
identification belongs to which participant. A reference to one of the participants noted
above the vertical lines at the beginning of the chart is signalled by an asterisk* .
The Una text with a literal interlinear translation is placed to the left of the display in

"3.3 NumeralsThe Una people use a counting system which is to a base twenty-seven system. Most
often, counting takes place in a face-to-face encounter by which the speaker points to his
upper extremities and head. He starts with the little flnger of the left hand and
continuing via the arm up over the head and down the right arm ends up with the little
flnger of the right hand, which has a numerical value of twenty-seven.dina -bajiNumerals are formed, with the exception of one to three and twenty-flve and twenty­

the cardinal numeral. Twenty-five and twenty-six are distinguished from two and three

to show the distinction between second and third person plural m arkers. Elsewhere
tone will not be marked on these pronouns since the person and number will be
apparent from the verb inflection.",[210]
"4.2 Noun phrase
There are eight tagmemes (cf. Figure 28) in a Una noun phrase which may be filled,
although it is rare for all slots to be represented simultaneously. Only the nucleus is
obligatory and consequently many noun phrases consist only of a single noun or proper
noun.",[101]
"133The first distinction made in the analysis of this discourse is between EVENTS and
non-events. Primary predications (cf. 8.3.1 .4) are underlined. Long stretches of speech
are sometimes devoted to nothing but event information (especially by means of
quotations as in sentences 73-80, etc.). The rules of the reference system, by means of
verb inflection and optional pronouns, are such in Una that the hearer always knows by
deduction who is doing what (to whom). Two events, regardless of their relation to time
( C ircumstantial, B i ologi cal, Conventio nal, Natural Ph enomenal , Cultural o r
C ontextual ; cf. 3.5) are reported as Event A and Event B. Backflash is considered t o be
part of the main-line of events told out of order. They are distinct from narrative
subsequences that are told in an explanatory fashion without being in the main-line of
events.
The information that identifies the PARTICI PANTS in an event not only links
participants to events, but also links consecutive references to the same participant.
I D ENTIFICATION has to do with the linguistic means the speaker uses to
communicate to the hearer/audience who or what is involved. Quite often double
identification ; e.g. 'they . . . all people', or 'all of us . . . we' is shown in the surface
structure by means of a pronoun and verb inflection. Obligatory subject identification in
Una verbs (and optional pronouns or proper nouns) makes it easy and clear for the hearer
to determine who or what is being talked about without becoming confused.
SETTING is that part of the text which provides information about where, when, and
under what circumstances actions take place. Setting can be in space and in time.
BACKGROUND, or secondary, information is not a part of the actual development of
the topic of the discourse itself, but stands outside and clarifies it. Events, participants
and setting can be con sidered to be primary components of a di scourse, while
explanations and comments have a secondary role which in Una is often reflected in the
distinctive secondary predication morpheme
'same actor suffix'; (e.g. sentence 7 :
'carrying', and sentence 1 2 :
'jumping'; cf. 8.3.1 .5).bobokasakweteboka-akaCOLLATERAL text in a discourse informs the hearer/audience about what did not
happen, instead of telling what did happen; (e.g. sentence 3: ""In the Langda language we
didn't call it a helicopter""). In this example the non-event is a rhetorical underlining of
the previous event described in sentence 2.
PERFORMATIVE information shows the influence of the speaker-hearer-situation.
In this discourse the speaker-hearer interaction can be noticed, for example, in the
opening of the discourse in sentence 1 : ""I will tell (to you) the Story of the Helicopter"", in
the closure of sentences 1 8 1 -3, but also in the body of the discourse , for example, in
sentence 1 20 : ""Their father, that's you!"".","[142, 143]"

tagmeme indicates: (1 ) the undergoer, i.e. th e person or persons undergoing the action,
or (2) the scope, i.e. the direction or the goal toward or away from which the action is

"INTRODUCTION1.1General introductionThe Una languagel is spoken by approximately 3500 people living in 40 villages and
h aml ets along the southern slope s of the central cordillera of the Pegunungan
Jayawijaya (Orange Mountains) in the Ey, Sayn , Mo, Yamiyl, Kiynok, Ira, Mina, Be
and Yay River valleys. These valleys are located between 1390 50' and 1400 20' eastern
longitude and 40 32' and 40 54' southern latitude within the boundaries of the Kecamatan
Kurima, in the Kabupaten Jayawijaya, in the province Irian Jaya (formerly Dutch New
Guinea) of the Republic of Indonesia.
The Una2 1anguage is part of the Goliath stock level family (Voorhoeve 1975:18, 46, 67,
69) of the Central New Guinea macro-phylum (SchiefenhoveI 1977:270, 275) which is also
called Trans-New Guinea phylum (Voorhoeve 1975:16, 63). The term 'Goliath' (de Kock
1 91 2) is based on European nomenclature (Schiefenhovel 1977:266; 1978:2). Therefore it
has been suggested recently, on account of the linguistic and cultural homogeneity of the
people (Schiefenhovel 1978:2) who live within a surprisingly large area of the Eastern
Highlands of Irian Jaya to designate this people and their stock level language family
with the term 'Mek' meaning 'water', analogous to the term 'Ok' which is used as a
name for the neighbours of the 'Mek' to the East.
Four lexicographically distinct Una dialects were noticed:
1. Central Ey River Valley Dialect
2. Northern Ey River Valley Dialect
3. Sayn River Valley Dialect
4. Eastern Una Dialectrei]Besides lexicographical differences the lack of the voiceless glottal fricative [h) as the
onset of
and [e) in the Central Ey River Valley Dialect, is also a distinctive feature of
the above mentioned Una dialects. Real bilingual and multilingual speakers are rare .
'
However, it is p ossible that in a single village, e specially one situated near a
l anguage/dialect boun dary, up to seven different dialects/languages of the Mek
Language Family are spoken, which are all mutually intelligible. This is, for example,
the case in the village of Langda, where, besides the previously named four Una dialects,
the Eipo, Lower Sela, and Kimyal dialects are also spoken. This is mainly caused by
intermarriage from neighbouring valleys. The relationship between those languages
and Una as members of the Mek Language Family (Louwerse 1 9 76a, b, 1 978a, e, 1 9 82b),
and the relationships of the latter to its neighbouring Trans-New Guinea Language
Family Groups - Dani to the west, and Ok to the east - can be seen in Figure 1 .",[11]

refer to the location of the object in question. Their directions are not tied to any point of
the compass, but to levels in relation to an object on the horizon and the location of the
speaker (Louwerse 1 985a).
The spectrum of relative distance in Una from very close to distant is different from
English, and has a varying threshold depending on the contexts in which it is used;
specifically, whether a person (including self), things, or both are involved.
Overriding this, the relative size of the things being observed, or reflected on, and the
context in which they are observed determine the specific term used (e.g. some celestial
bodies might be called very close even though they are light-years apart). By means of a
tone distinction in the locational deictics two degrees of relative nearness or remoteness
can be indicated.",[85]

markers were de scribed and the formal elements corresponding with the specific38

tagmeme slot (cf. 2.15) will be described. In some cases the phonological fusion of these
morphemes has progressed to the degree that partials are difficult to define and describe
as such . In those cases we will treat them as portmanteau. As stated in 2.9.1 , this
treatment as portmanteau of partial s and patterns reflected in the subject suffix
portmanteau is not completely satisfying, but has to do for now since the necessary sub­
analysis falls outside the main scope of th is work. It is planned to describe the sub­
analysis of subject sufflx portmanteaus in another paper. If individual morphemes can
be identifled, we will treat them as a compound. The criteria to distinguish the tense­
actor suffixes from one another are in the form of the following seven triplets:

on whether the result is, or is not, current at the point of reference, or is a continuous
action. The incomplete aspect suffix
in combination with the tense-actor suffix is
normally used in narrative discourse because it describes an event which happened at a
previous time, but which is still relevant to the narrator or his/her audience and therefore
viewed as an incomplete event.{-rna}The ten se-actor suffixes can be grouped in three categories according to their
