"Free pronouns may be followed by the determiner eng, as regular nouns may.
But whereas the determiner indicates definiteness in the case of nouns, its
function following pronouns is slightly different. Although related in the
sense that 'given NPs' are potential topics.
Following a pronoun, the
determiner can be best glossed as 'as for':(26) wo engininou wau imâhe this ourgâsendeboy younger.brother like thus'As for him, he is like our younger brother'3.3.1Possessive pronounsThe possessive pronouns precede the possessed head noun, as in:(27) yonou munai
myhouse'my house'The possessor, when identified by means of a noun, precedes the possessive
pronoun. If the possessor noun is itself possessed or modified, it is virtually
a full NP, except that this NP may not be closed off with the determiner eng.
If the possessor noun has the nominal operator eng with it, intonational
features suggest that the possessed item stands in apposition. Let us consider
the following examples :(28) (a)manâib eng, wonou urgarden big this its(eng)father (the)'this big garden, its owner'MORPHOLOGY(b)manâib wonou urgarden big its55(eng)father (the)'the owner of the big garden'(c)manâib ur(eng)garden big father (the)'the owner of the big garden'In (28) (a) the NP man âib eng has a slightly rising intonation and is
followed by a pause.
I would analyze this example as consisting of two NPs
standing in apposition. The first NP seems to function as Theme.
Strictly
speaking, it is separate from the predication that is being made of wonou ur
'its owner', even though it is relevant to this predication.
In (28) (b) and (28) (c) we have instances of a single NP, with not much
difference in meaning. This may also be illustrated by the reduction of Yagos
wonou unor 'Yagos his mother' to Yagos unor 'Yagos' mother'. The reduction of a
possessive phrase by eliminating the possessive pronoun seems restricted to
phrases with a kin term as HN. When the possessor is animate and the possessed
item is inanimate, the possessive pronoun is obligatory:(29) (a)munon wonou bei
manhisaxe'the man's axe'(b) *munon bei
man
axe3.3.2Emphatic pronouns and reflexivesPossessive pronouns in Usan are also used in emphatic reference:(30)in _ârwonouderqâmâr-awe just herself get.up say-3sDSgasigubig-ounonly hear.SS be-lp.Pr'We are just hearing herself get up and speak'STRUCTURES AND THEIR FUNCTIONS IN USAN56Just as English uses the reflexive pronoun form to express emphatic
reference, Usan uses the possessive pronoun also for reflexives. However, in
this case the possessive pronoun forms a compound with ml 'something':
yonomi
'myself', nonomi 'yourself', etc. For example:(31)nonomiduiqibigo-ânne?yourself hand.over.SS go.SS be-2s.Pr and'You want to kill yourself, huh?'","[72, 73, 74]"
"[When someone walks ata dangerous place, e.g. near a precipice]Plural possessive forms may be reduplicated when expressing reflexivity for

The
reason is that possession may also be expressed with regular free pronouns, as
(35) illustrates.(35) ye wauIengis-oreichild this descend-3s.FP'My child has gone down'3.3.3Social distance in pronominal referenceIn 1.1.2.2 we have seen that the Usan society is characterized by a general
reluctance to use proper names. There is an outright taboo on the use of proper
names with respect to affinal relations, such as mund 'in-law of same
generation', ya-ga 'my father-in-law',
inemi
'mother-in-law'.
Singular
referents who stand in one of these relationships to ego have to be addressed
with the second person plural pronoun an. Similarly, when individuals of these
categories are referred to, the third person plural pronoun wuri has to be used.
According to Head (1978), such variation in number is the most widespread
device by which languages signal respect or social distance, as for example in a
number of European languages (Dutch, German, French, etc). It has also been
recorded for the Highlands language Kobon (Davies 1981:153). As in Kobon, Usan
predicates agree in number when the plural pronoun that refers to a singular
referent is the subject.
Comrie (1975) has shown that the more verb-like a
predicate is, the more likely it is to agree with the features of the surface
subject rather than with the real world number of its referent. In Usan, number
is only marked on verbs, not on adjectives or nouns, so that more detailed
comparison with Comrie's hierarchy is not possible.
The rule specifying which relations require polite reference has to be
qualified as follows. The reference of respect is not obligatory in the case of
say, mund 'brother-in-law'. Certain mund-s may have acquired a kind of brother
relationship. One knows them well, has a close friendship with them.
Then, a
singular pronoun in addressing or referring to them is acceptable. If one does
use the plural in such instances it is to signal some fear or awe.
Social
distance as a feature of plural address or reference to an individual may be
more appropriate than respect.
Father- and mother-in-law, however, are invariably addressed and referred
to by plural equivalents of second and third person pronouns. The relationship
to them is characterized as sig qau 'very sacred/taboo'.
Considering the overwhelming number of unrelated languages that Head quotes
as exhibiting this phenomenon, many more Papuan languages may have to be
included. As Head postulates, the usage of plural for social distance seems to58STRUCTURES AND THEIR FUNCTIONS IN USANpoint out the iconicity of language: a relationship to a group is less intimate
than that to an individual. The use of a plural pronoun and/or plural verb affix
in referring to an indivudual may be seen as a device to 'magnify' the other.","[74, 75, 76]"
"3.3PronounsUsan has a system of six personal pronouns.
The singular forms reflect
rather clearly the proto-forms of Set III, which Wurm (1975) has posited for
certain areas covered by the Trans New Guinea phylum, including the Madang
province (cf. 1.1.3.2.1): 1s da~ta~ya; 2s _na_; and either nu of Set III or wa of
Set II. The free pronouns are given in (22). They are used rather frequently
although each verb clearly identifies the person-number of the subject and, in
the case of animates, of the object. The free pronouns are recognizable in the
possessive forms as well as in the object prefixes that are required by certain
action verbs. These derived forms suggest that the present free pronoun forms
for first and second person plural are abbreviated forms.",[70]
"3.8.3PostpositionsTwo connectives are used for comitative relations: nob (which is used in
the colour adjectives) and ten, both meaning 'with' = 'accompanied with/by'.
Nob can be used both with human, animate and inanimate objects; ten is only used
with inanimate items, and it means something like 'with all that' or 'together
with'. As is the case in many other Papuan languages (also in West-African
languages, cf. Lord 1973; and e.g. in Russian, see Nichols et al. 1980), the
comitative may be considered as part of the subject for the purpose of marking
number on the verb.",[103]
"The whole nominalized clause (ur ... wurugumatarau) functions as the noun
phrase modifying the HN qomon 'custom'. In such contructions it is then very
unlikely that the HN will be further modified by adjectives and quantifiers, or
that the composite HN (=Nominalized clause + HN) will function as a HN of a
replacive relative clause (see 6.2), although, again, this is in principle
possible.
The formula for NP (1) shows that Usan is not an exceptional SOV language.
It conforms to Greenberg's universal
#20 in that the order of modifiers with
respect to the HN is: N_ + Adjective + Numeral + Demonstrative (1966:69).
Furthermore, Usan is postpositional and has the genetive preceding the noun,
which makes it, together with the general order of the NP, an example of one of
the
more
preferred
language types according to Hawkins' principle of
Cross-category Harmony (1980:224). According to Hawkins' predictions, non-rigid
Verb-final languages would be more harmonic with at least some operators on the
noun following it, whereas rigid V-final languages would be more likely to have
the operators precede the noun.
It will become clear that Usan is rather
rigidly V-final (but cf. 5.1.1 and 6.6 and 6.7 where possible 'leaks' are
discussed).
Since Hawkins' predictions are not meant to be absolute, Usan may
be seen as a rigid Verb-final language with a deviant Genitive-Noun order.
In 3.5.3 I already discussed the possibility of quantifiers following the
determiner, contrary to what is indicated in (1). If that is the case, as in
(5), the quantifier is no longer part of the NP, but stands in apposition,
leading to a partitive interpretation.(5) (a)wonou wau
eng ombur um-umirei

In the case of pa, _pi, and such distance-specifying words, here
isagain(asthe case with the temporal qoan 'old, before') the best analysis seems to bethat they are original adjectives with the head noun deleted.(71) (a)qumo-tigoqitebigdier-inenCompare:engsteep.down-at be.SS climb.up.SS come.up-2s.UF theaiqândpibur-ibâground quickly near become-3s.Fut'If you are steep down and were to climb up, the ground

"Concepts such as 'general simultaneity' as in the case of Anggor an-, and
'sequence' for Fore ma, seem to be more specific semantic labels for instances
of pragmatic presupposition.
Any event that is described as preceding or
enveloping the event of the main predication is ipso facto background. That is,
it needs to be taken for granted by the hearer if he wishes to identify the main
predication. Similarly, the concepts of 'contrast' and 'contra-expectation'
involve the presupposition of one event. As I have said earlier, assertion and
presupposition only form extremes on a continuum.
This would explain the
apparent historical shifts resulting in synchronic fuzziness with regard to
certain conjunctions (cf. 6.7 and 6.8).
Having seen that the forms translated by many researchers in Papuan
languages as 'but' are in fact the demonstratives for topic marking and
relativizing, it is not surprising that the history of English 'but' shows a
development from a preposition to a coordinate
conjunction.
Jespersen
(1917:127ff) shows how Old English be-utan developed from a preposition via a
negative relative pronoun to a
""natural conjuntion where the notion is
negative"" (p.131), which is frequent in an object clause after a negative
expression, as in:(97) It_ must not be denied but I_ am a plaine dealing villaine
(p.130)In the same way, Usan eng (or: ego for some speakers when the sense of
antithesis has to be conveyed) 'this given', Waskia mu 'that' and equivalent
forms in other Papuan languages convey a contrastive conjunction. As such, it
is not infrequently used to introduce new sentences (6.8). I take the embedding
by means of a preposition to be of the same nature as that by means of
demonstrative-like forms.",[266]
"In some verbs, as ârir 'throw', the m may be deleted, so that twoSTRUCTURES AND THEIR FUNCTIONS IN USAN48alternate forms are acceptable: ârir-e-m-om 'throw, sg.Imp' and arir-om. This
is exceptional.
When a process verb is formed out of a noun stem with a different final
consonant (i.e. not a / r / ) , the epenthetic vowel takes on the front or back
feature of the preceding stem vowel: itum 'night, darkness' itum-o-r-(â)-m-â
'it gets dark'.
The second epenthetic vowel harmonizes with the vowel of the
suffix only in very slow speech.
When a word is affixed with the causative si to make it into an action
verb, epenthetic /e/ is needed only in a few cases. It is not really possible to
state a rule for its presence. For example, the one-syllable stem mein 'calm,
gentle' , when affixed with si has mein-e-si only in slow speech, whereas in
(stem of inâb 'lie down') has in-e-si always. A stem with final stop like song
'idle' has song-e-si 'to confuse, scramble', but âib 'big' does not allow a
transition vowel before the suffix: aib-si 'to make big'.
In any case, fast speech in most cases does not seem to have problems with
the cluster Cs_, so that the rule of epenthetic vowel insertion may be on its way
out.
One final morphological rule for the suffixation of -si is that stem-final
/n/ in unstressed syllables is elided, compare:múmun
woyán3.2'corpse'
'?'múmu-si
woyán-si'kill off' and
'to mediate, appease'NounsNouns in Usan are those words that function as heads of term expressions.
Usan does not allow a definition in morphological terms,
since there is no
inflection of nouns.
The definition as given would also admit adjectives and
question words to the class of nouns.
But, when the latter two categories
appear
as the head of NPs , it is recoverable from the linguistic or
extra-linguistic context which nouns they qualify.
Given the established CV patterns (2.2) we can deduce that wherever a
(hetero-organic) consonant cluster occurs in a noun, the word consists of two
morphemes, even where the original parts are no longer identifiable as
autonomous items, as in qâb-turin 'Pinon imperial pigeon'. In contrast to the
other word classes (verbs, adjectives, adverbs, deictics), nouns are hardly ever
reduplicated (see further 3.9.3).
Some nouns are inherently reduplicated,
especially some yam species and bird names:dórundoru'kind of yam'qumb-qumb'a kind of sorumbi [a tuber]'qin-qin'a cockatoo'.","[65, 66]"

Z'graggen lists dual pronouns for the languages of the Adelbert Range
super-stock. But he makes explicit that for many languages the formation
consists of nothing else than the plural pronoun plus the numeral 'two'. Usan
is typical of this group. It does not show any evidence of a specific dual
category, as it may be recognized in Siroi (7), which represents the Rai Coast
stock of the same sub-phylum.","[33, 34]"

for a grammar of Usan. I will briefly illustrate and discuss the criteria for
the various word classes by referring to their semantic and
syntactic
peculiarities, with excursions into pragmatic exploitations that are allowed in
some cases. Following this I will discuss the various forms of affixation,
which is mainly restricted to verbs. The few non-verbal instances of affixation
are discussed in 3.9.2. Reduplication (3.9.3) affects all major categories,
such as noun, verb, adjective, and adverb.","[59, 60, 61]"
"3.5.4.1Non-scalar adjectivesNon-scalar adjectives seem to form a separate sub-class, in that they
invariably follow the head noun immediately. They are more noun-like than scalar
adjectives, and they behave similarly to material and other
non-scalar
adjectives in European languages.
Non-scalar adjectives are used for the
categories AGE, COLOUR, and some PHYSICAL PROPERTIES.
The category AGE cannot be expressed apart from SEX.
The adjectives
denoting these categories also signal SOCIAL STATUS when referring to humans:(51)Theyoung unmarriedmarriedwidowedmalemoibârâiqoifemaleyoróunâromqind6uadjectivebârâi is generalized in its meaning 'grown up/important' and canin that sense also be used with yâmângâr 'woman'.

sabúm'old, used' [now: second hand]Temen can be used for animate and inanimate entities. Bubun means 'for the
first time' and frequently refers to humans: munon bubun 'a new man' is someone
who is new to a certain activity. The antonym qoan 'old' denotes the opposite
of both temen and bubun.
In contrast to the terms in (54) qoan can be
intensified.
It may also be used as a temporal adverb. Presumably, its head
noun gen 'time' is so well understood that qoan by itself is used to mean 'long
ago' or 'before' (cf. 3.6.1).
A number of non-scalar adjectives are highly restricted as far as their
collocation with head nouns is concerned. Many of them do not have a lexical
item as antonym. This seems to be the case for adjectives that express a state
different to what would be naturally expected, e.g. quum 'deaf', igug 'deaf (of
nuts)', gog6r 'orphan' (=wau gogor 'child orphan').","[83, 84]"

'Accessory verbs' are used in relative clauses (her 'included' clauses), and are
more restricted in their inflection than finite verbs. It would appear that
Gahuku not only has prenomlnal RCs, but also replacive ones, in which case the
head noun is part of the RC:(24) agmina makisi na
thosemoq-ma-mogreens he.ate Top-Def-sg.subj'Those greens that he ate... said:voe-li
what?-it.said""What?"" (Deibler 1976:49)Deibler analyzed (24) as an instance of postnominal RCs: na 'he ate' as RC,
following the head noun makisi 'greens'. This RC structure, as alternate to the
one in (22), is preferred when no head noun is available (i.e. where English
would have 'the one that...' or 'those who...'), and when the RC exists of more
than one clause. Rather than analyzing (24) as a postnominal RC, I would see it
as a replacive RC: in stead of the equivalent HN within the RC, it is the
antecedent N that is not expressed. In fact, Gahuku allows the fully expressed
NPs to occur simultaneously, if the speaker needs to emphasize the, clearly
topical, head noun (Deibler, pers. comm.):(25) vegana lamana keza mihuka hora ale vegana nene...

"Conversely, Usan may choose when the number and person categoriesbothchange,in which cases Kewa has obligatory DS.
In both languages then the person category is more important than the number
category.
When the shift in number goes the other way, i.e. from singular to plural,
again with the singular participant being part of the plural set, as in (64),
Kewa and Usan agree in marking the change of person as DS:(64)3 sg shot a pig and 3 p1 carried it home

SS and Kewa may choose, except that Usan may choose also with the person lowest
on the hierarchy. Apparently, there are cases where it is at the discretion of
the speaker, within the general rules of the language whether he/she marks a
certain partitioning as SS or DS. The decisive factor for the choice seems to
be pragmatic : does the speaker consider the shift in participants important
enough to warrant a DS marking? In other words, if, for example, a Kewa speaker
has been thinking about a group of which he was a part and then shifts the
attention completely to himself as an individual, he would mark 1 p 1 → 1 sg as
DS. If he as speaker was the center of attention to begin with, he may choose
the SS marking when going from singular to plural.
With the person category
remaining the same, Usan can only choose when going from 3 sg → 3 p1.",[220]
"1.1.3.31.1.3.3.1Syntactic characteristicsWord orderIt can be safely said that most Papuan languages of the TNG phylum have the19THE USAN PEOPLE AND THEIR LANGUAGEverb in the sentence final position.
The order of the terms, i.e. nuclear
arguments and peripheral satellites as they are known in Functional Grammar (Dik
1978, 1980, etc.), is relatively free. Nevertheless, it seems that the Subject
(which covers the various semantic functions such as Agent, Positioner, etc.)
normally precedes the Object (Goal, Recipient) in most neutral orders in the
clause, so that we may speak of a basic SOV order in these languages (see
further chapter 4, where the order possibilities are discussed in more detail).
The majority of these languages have the adjective following the noun in
the NP. This is a fair generalization of the languages of the Madang-Adelbert
sub-phylum and the Finisterre-Huon group. A number of the Highlands languages
have some adjectives preceding the noun, others following it.
The Genitive preceding the Head Noun is a more general pattern.
This is
also
true
for
the
order
Adverb-Verb.
Most of these languages are
postpositional: 'axe-with'. The postposition may be either a free adposition or
a clitic that is attached to the last word of the NP.
The
following
preferred orders are also widespread: condition-main
predication; cause-effect; intention-main predication. For the latter semantic
relationship, the use of the verb 'to say' is a typical feature of TNG phylum
languages, somewhat in the form of: 'the woman 'getting yam' saying, to the
garden went' for ""The woman went to the garden in order to get some y a m "" . The
specifics of these constructions are discussed in chapter 6, where many
comparative notes are made which relate Usan to other Papuan languages.","[36, 37]"

adjectives, but then asserts that there is evidence that they are deverbal nouns
occurring as qualifiers (p.263).
His latter assertion seems to me more
plausible.
Hua, together with other Eastern Highlands languages such as Siane,
Gahuku and Fore, has at least some qualifying adjectives following the head
noun. In Usan all adjectives follow the noun (3.5), but modifying nouns precede
the HN:(34) (a) munon âib eng
man
big the(b) munai ginam eng
house place the'The big man''The house place = village'222STRUCTURES AND THEIR FUNCTIONS IN USANPrenominal RCs operate in the same way as prenominal nouns: iyau goter 'he bit
the dog' in (32) and munai 'house' in (34) occupy the same slot in the NP. This
suggests that a prenominal RC is in fact a nominalized clause. However, in (32)
the verb does not show the nominalization morpheme -au (3.2.2).
The prenominal RCs seem to be closely related to the more frequently used
replacive RCs, which take the place of noun phrases.
If there is a functional
difference between nominalized clauses as noun modifiers and prenominal RCs, it
is very subtle. I have not been able to detect it. Compare the two modifying
clauses in (35), which have the same gloss.(35) (a)(b)sarau ba-tar
igo
yâmângâr ger
work hold-pl.Ben.SS be.3s.Pr woman
onesarau ba-tar-auyâmângâr gerworkwomanhold-pl.Ben.NOMone'A woman who works for others = a servant'It is with this habitual aspect that prenominal RCs are likely to occur. A
nominalized clause as in (35) (b) MUST be habitual or generic, as seems to be
the case for processes of noun-incorporation in
other
languages
(cf.
Mardirussian 1975). But the prenominal RC, although it is most frequently used
with habitual or generic events, may also refer to specific events in which the
referent of the HN is engaged.
Thus, (36) (a) is not acceptable with the
indicated gloss, whereas (36) (b) is:(36) (a) *mani u-t-au

wash-CM-3s.Pa'She washed the eye which the mud had injured'Both these languages resemble Usan, although they belong to different
families, in that the verb of the RC is final, with full inflection.
It would
seem that some Highlands languages, such as Hua (Haiman 1980) and Fore (Scott
1978), differentiate the functions of Usan eng over two (perhaps more, as is the
case in Siane, D. James, pers. comm.) morphemes. Hua ma, which replaces the
indicative mode affix -e in RC verbs, is identified as a near deictic (Haiman
1980:258).
According to Haiman (1976) the connective
particle
mo
is
historically related to ma, and this marks potential topics.
Fore ma is called a delineator in a NP by Scott (1978:100). Its origin
might be the same as Hua ma. (In fact, morphemes equivalent to ma occur in most
Highlands languages.
In various languages some meaning of 'givenness' or
'specificity' seems appropriate, cf. Korafe amo in 6.3 (71)).
Fore does not seem to use ma for RCs, but besides the above-mentioned use
on NPs, it is also used with medial verbs. In the latter case, the clause with
ma seems to adopt some presuppositional status, cf. Reesink 1983a.
The Fore RC makes use of a final verb, i.e. with full inflection for tense,
and a special set of subject person-number suffixes, called Emphatic subject
morphemes. Fore ma, marking potential agent or actor, and a sequential
relationship between medial verb clauses, may well be related to some deictic.
Scott (1978:82) list m á : ' as the near deictic 'this', 'here', and compounds with
ma for various far decitics. My point here is that it is basically a deictic
form whose usage is extended to mark states of affairs the speaker takes for
granted.","[251, 252]"
"7.2.1.3Content questionsContent questions form the domain in which question words (3.4) function.
Again, Usan follows the general pattern of SOV languages, and Papuan languages
in particular, in that the position of question words is the same as that of the
corresponding non-interrogative constituent in declarative sentences. Since for
pragmatic reasons the order of constituents is relatively free, and hence the
Goal may follow or precede the Agent, this is also the case for a questioned

"1.1.3.2.4Medial verbsProbably the most characteristic feature of languages belonging to the
Trans New Guinea phylum is the use of special verb forms to signal clausal
conjunction.
Such verb forms are generally known as 'medial verbs'. The term
reflects the fact that they signal that at least one more clause needs to follow
to reach the end of a well-formed sentence. A second function served by medial
verb affixation is to indicate a switch-reference system, i.e. it indicates
whether the subject of the following clause is coreferential (SS for Same
Subject) or not (DS for Different Subject) to the subject of the clause in which
the medial verb functions as predicate.
There are languages in which the medial verb also indicates some temporal
relationship between two consecutive clauses.
It does not seem possible to
point to common factors in the morphology of medial verbs as they appear in the
TNG phylum languages.
Among the Highlands languages, the most frequent pattern of the medial verb
structure may be given as:(8)verb stem + medial morpheme + anticipatory subjectThe medial morpheme may be 0 if the subjects of the consecutive clauses are
coreferential. In that case, of course, the anticipatory subject is the same as
the subject of the medial verb. In some languages, e.g. Fore (Scott 19 78) of
the East-Central family, and Telefol (Healey 1965) of the Ok family, the medial
morpheme may signal simultaneity or sequence as temporal relationships between
the medial verb and the following clause.
Haiman (1980:xlviii) presents two other patterns for medial verbs, which
can be combined into :STRUCTURES AND THEIR FUNCTIONS IN USAN18(9) SS:
DS:verb stem + (in)variable ending
verb stem + (more complex) variable ending marking the

"261Lest the yam wither'It should be evident from this example that the meaning 'lest' is not captured
by the form qâmb. A culturally desirable state of affairs in the subordinate
clause would require the meaning 'in order that'.
As was the case with conditionals, temporals, and reason sentences,
likewise with purpose sentences one may subordinate medial clauses by adding
the demonstrative, in which case the purpose clause functions as the protasis of
a conditional:(129)is i s - i b
qâmb
eng song i s
you descend-sg.Fut.SS say.SS the i d l e descend.sg.Imp' I f you want to go down, j u s t go'Other languages may operate in the same way. They would embed a medial

by means of a demonstrative, as Siroi (130) illustrates (from Wells 1978:129):(130) tango wande kanger-am

"(52) I'm looking for a man that has traveled faster than
the speed of lightObviously, if RCs could only express presuppositions in a truth-semantic
sense, that would be a correct observation. Notice, however, that the head noun
of the RC in (52) is marked indefinite. That means that the speaker does not
claim the truth of the presupposition.
In other languages, the difference
between a proven fact and a supposed possibility can be expressed by different
verb forms.
This is the case for instance in Spanish. Consider the two
examples in (53), discussed by Rivero (1971).(53) (a) Losqueseconsiderán(Indicative)those that themselves they.considercapaces seránlos mejorescapable will.be the better(b) Los que se consideren (Subjunctive) capaces serán

people who consider themselves capable. The speaker who utters (53) (b) with a
subjunctive mode in the RC, says that IF there are people who consider
themselves capable, they will be the better ones.

semantic function that requires the oblique object marker -t (in (45) (b) -t

the main clause.
It is therefore the topic of the sentence. As such it may
occupy the sentence-initial position, but then it is stripped of its grammatical
relator -t Alternatively, the Ins may retain its unmarked position, as in (45)
(b) . It keeps the relator -t. If the item is not repeated as was the case with
the object NP in (30) (b), the resulting construction is acceptable, but it is
not frequently used. The RC construction of (45) (b) is only possible if the
Ins is marked as 'given' (topical) with eng. If the relator -t were simply
affixed to the noun, as bei-t 'with an axe', one could not relativize on the
Instrument.","[243, 244]"
"STRUCTURES AND THEIR FUNCTIONS IN USAN208these metaphors.
Central to the discussion of subordination in Usan is the function of the
determiner eng, which makes up about 9 percent of all word tokens in texts with
a total of 37500 words.
In 3.7 I showed that eng is made up of the near
deictic e 'here, this' and the suffix -ng (phonetically [ng]) which indicate
'givenness'. The determiner eng not only functions in 'Given NPs', which are
potential topics, but also with
nominalized predications. A nominalized
predication may function as a replacive relative clause, a conditional protasis,
or as a temporal adverbial clause. When the nominalized predication with eng as
its determiner is cliticized with the postpositional clitic -t, it expresses
cause or reason.
The nominalized predication, if followed by eng, is a
presuppositional nominal in all these cases.
In order to show the structural and functional relations, I will first
discuss in some more detail the pragmatic functions of Topic and Theme.
In
section 2 the relative clause will be discussed, followed by a discussion of
conditionals in 6.3, temporals in 6.4, and cause and reason in 6.5. The notion
of reason is semantically related to that of purpose. Purpose and related
relations make use of the periphrastic verb qamb 'to say' in Usan and other
Papuan languages.
This is a different form of subordination, which will be
discussed in 6.6.
Finally in this chapter I will compare some of these subordinate constructions
with coordinate relations (6.7) and illustrate how the morphological markers eng
'the, this, that' and ne 'and' may also be employed to conjoin sentences into
natural sequences.","[225, 226]"
"( 13 )John Ag gave a_ book Go to Peter Rec(14)The climate Fo gave John Rec new strength GoBut this implies that different verbs give have to be listed in the
lexicon, with different arguments. This solution does not seem superior to the
verb classification in case grammars, where each verb is given with its basic
case frame.
But if each verb is listed as such, it may no longer be so
revealing to classify them along the two coordinates of control and dynamism,
unless it is to define the total set of semantic functions a certain language
differentiates. In other words, Dik's classification necessitates two semantic
functions that have control over the state of affairs: Agent for Action verbs,
Positioner for Position verbs. Dik's classification is attractive, in that it
recognizes the presumably universal importance of volition that is involved in
controllable states of affairs. The dimension of dynamism I find a little more
difficult to handle. Just as with the concept of transitivity, one can ask what
it is that is being dynamic in some states of affairs describing psychological
states such as hate, love, believe, etc. If one wants to formulate some general
syntactic rules for various classes in Usan, a classification according to the
two parameters in Functional Grammar is insufficient.
It is true that Dik's Functional Grammar allows for a subdivision of the
four classes according to the nuclear arguments of the predicates. But such a
categorization would still not allow for optimal generalizations of syntactic
rules in Usan. The classification which I consider necessary for Usan predicates
is basically a semantic one, supported with various syntactic-morphological
rules. On the basis of various rule possibilities one can distinguish eleven
classes, which I will rank according to controllability and transitivity.",[146]
"Once a verb is suffixed with the distributive morpheme, it has changed its
conjugation class and become a member of class 6, ending in -i_. Example (150)
shows a verb with a different distributive suffix: -umi. This morpheme is not
as productive as -ri.
It may only occur on a few verbs. Since it is not
possible to give a general rule for the occurrence of -umi, it will have to be
specified in the lexicon.
The same example (150) illustrates the pragmatic freedom speakers have in
handling grammatical categories. Although the verb signals the distributive
plurality of the object, the addressee carried only one mat. The speaker can
refer to a single object by using the plural category if he wants to express his
indignation about the event. We saw that plural pronouns may be used to refer
to single individuals of a taboo class, the in-laws (3.3.4), and that
reduplication of deictics may be used to exaggerate a distance (3.7). The
metaphorical use of the distributive suffix forms another instance of the
principle that plurality is used to indicate psychological distance.",[130]

3p = wuri
wuru(w)oroThe referenced object may be present as a nominal constituent in the same
clause or sentence or in a preceding one.
As far as its affix status is
concerned, I may mention that it is as loose as the reciprocal prefix. That is,
the object pronoun may be detached from the verb, in which case it is
insensitive to the processes of vowel assimilation (2.1.8.3). Also, with verbs
like ab 'call' the pronoun functions as the purpose, affixed with the
postposition -t.
In 3.1 I have given three verbs which have the object pronoun (actually, it
might be better to speak of 'goal pronoun', but cf. 4.4.1; 4.4.2) incorporated
in the verb stem. That is to say, wâb 'to shoot', wârâmb 'to hit', and utâb 'to
give' change their stems considerably according to the person-number of their
goals. Other action verbs will have zero object prefix for third person
singular.
Since inanimate plural subjects are cross-referenced on the verb asMORPHOLOGY109singular (cf. 4.4.2), it is indeterminable whether the object prefix can
cross-reference only animate objects. Given the way plural inanimate objects
are conceived of as singular, the third person plural object prefix could never
refer to inanimate objects, and the third person singular does not have an
explicit object prefix.
The singular object prefixes assimilate their vowel to the vowel of the
verb stem in most cases. The process of vowel assimilation is rather weak in
Usan.
For example, duet 'to desire someone to stay' changes the object prefix
vowel of ye 'I' to a high back variant /u/ (and the alveolar stop is weakened to
a flap): yu-ruét. But suâb leaves the prefix unchanged: ye-suab 'cutting me'.
Some verbs drop the initial glottal: qoat 'wait' yields noat 'wait for you';
others leave at least a trace: na-qaiget 'carry you on the shoulder'.
Plural object prefixes also change their vowel features in the following
way: in 'lp' and an ' 2p ' are followed by an epenthetic vowel (or is it the high
front vowel /-i/ as is found in possessive pronouns?) preceding a verb stem with
initial consonant. This vowel harmonizes with the stem vowel. The vowels of in
and an. themselves are immune. This is not the case with wuri ' 3p ' . Preceding
stems with /a/, /a/, or /o/, the prefix becomes woro or oro. Preceding stems of
which the first vowel is /u/, only the prefix final vowel has to be assimilated:
wuru-bumani 'embrace them'.
When consonant-initial verb stems have a front
vowel (/i/ or /e/) as first vowel wuri remains unchanged:
wuri-qenungar
'like/love them'.
Verbs of the conjugation classes 1, 2, 3, 4a, and 4b have the SS medial
suffixes -et, -at, -ot, -âb replaced with -ar when their object prefix refers to
a plural object.
As an exception to this rule, it should be mentioned that
class 3, i.e. those ending on -ot, retain the back vowel /o/.
Thus we get:(144)irubét'wait impatiently' : an-irubar 'to waitgumát'spear' :wuru-gumár 'to spear them'mirimot'lie, deceive' :wuri-mirimo-ár 'to deceive them'impatiently for you.pl'The verb gab 'to see' distinguishes itself from all others by the fact that

submitted as a doctoral thesis to the Faculty of Arts of the university of
Amsterdam.
Usan is a Papuan language spoken by approximately 1400 people in the
MadangProvinceofPapuaNew Guinea. I would like to express my deepestappreciation to numerous Usan speakers who taughtmetheirlanguageandtheir culture, and who extended their friendship to me. My main teacher has
been Piniau Manat, who for years has beenmyfriendandcolleague.","[4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]"

function: (i) if a language allows both Go and Rec to occupy the Object
function; (ii) if a language has a 'Raising'-rule by which the Ag of a
subordinate clause is marked as Obj of the superordinate predicate; and (iii) if
a language allows a causative opposition between schema's such as x made y V z
and x made z to be V-ed by y. Usan has none of these possibilities.
This means that Dik's Functional Grammar would consider the syntactic
functions Subject and Object irrelevant for Usan. In spite of my affinity to
Dik's model, I have nevertheless appealed to these functions in order to account
for cross-reference of some semantic functions on the verb. Not only Ag is
cross-referenced for person-number on the verb. The functions Positioner,
Processed and Force (and Item, which is needed for State predicates formed by a
Position-taking verb + continuative igo 'be, stay') are cross-referenced by the
same verbal suffix. In the case of inanimate semantic functions (Proc, Fo, It)
number is not signalled as plural; inanimate entities are cross-referenced by a
third person singular subject affix (cf. Classical Greek, where neuter plural
subjects trigger only singular verb "" a g r e e m e n t "" ) .
Rather than having to specify that the verb agrees with a number of
semantic functions, I would suggest that it is the syntactic function Subject
that triggers verb agreement.
This allows us to formulate rules that pertain
equally to all semantic functions that are cross-referenced by the verbal
suffix. For example, the rules of switch-reference, as they will be given in
5.3, refer to the syntactic function Subject, albeit that factors of topichood
may override their application.
Within the framework of Dik's Functional Grammar, De Groot (1981) has
suggested to use the concept of
""First Argument"" for the set of semantic
functions that are cross-referenced like the Agent (for a similar solution cf.
Okombo 1983 for Dholuo). Given the definition of Subject as entertained by Dik
C.S., namely "" t h e point of view from which a state of affairs is described"", I
see no problem with a stipulation that in Usan the subject function is
invariably assigned to the semantic function Agent (at least in transitive
constructions).","[177, 178]"

a sentence-initial position, which can be either P 2 in (1), or if this position
is absent, P1 as illustrated by:(21) (a)munon engmanthe, wonou manTHEMEhissoauis-oreigarden l a n d s l i d e descend-3s .FP'Given the man [= as for the man], his garden went down

As Downing (1978) has pointed out, there are no universally valid syntacticcharacteristics of a relative clause (RC). Some general
presencefeaturesincludetheof a finite verb, or a distinctive non-finite form; the RC often has apronoun coreferential with a noun preceding or following the RC; the RC together
witha nominal forms a NP constituent; the RC begins or ends with a distinctivemarker.
As a semantic characterization, Downing states that a RC never stands aloneSUBORDINATION217as a complete sentence.
It is always linked, semantically at least, to a NP
which is part of another clause. In other words, a RC functions as (part of) a
term of a predication.
This characterization is compatible with the semantic definition given by
Keenan and Comrie (1977): "" A n y syntactic object is a RC if it specifies a
larger set, called DOMAIN of relativization and then restricted to some subset
of which the restricting sentence is t r u e "" .
Kuno (1976b) states what he calls
the thematic constraint on relative clauses as follows: "" A RC must be a
statement about the relative NP and thus about its antecedent"".
These characterizations hold for three Usan constructions. The first one
employs a nominalized predication with the verb in the form 'stem + au' (cf.
3.2.2), which precedes the head noun it modifies.
A
second
relative
construction also
precedes the head noun, but in this case the RC contains a
finite (i.e. final) verb. The third
relative construction contains the nominal
constituent about which it makes a statement. In this RC too, the predicate is
in the form of a final verb, which is normally followed by the determiner eng.
In other words, the whole predication takes the place of a nominal with eng as
operator. It is this third construction that is structurally identical to
subordinate clauses that function as a conditional protasis, a temporal
adverbial, or a reason adverbial. I will first discuss the form of the RC, in
comparison with some other Papuan langauges. An account of the (pragmatic)
function of the RC will provide a natural bridge to the discussion of the
structurally similar subordinate clauses.","[233, 234, 235]"

"4.4.1.8BeneficiaryBeneficiary (Ben) is always animate. Ben may be expressed as a satellite
(see 4.4.2) or be incorporated in the verb (cf. 3.9.1.3.3), or both in some
cases. Ben may co-occur with most action verbs [+ Go], perception verbs, some
process verbs, and the verb igo. With action verbs [+ Go], the Beneficiary term
may be marked with the postposition -t (75) (a), with the postposition on an
appositional free pronoun (75) (b), only on the verb (75) (c), or both on the
verb and on the term (75) (d).(75) (a)narau

be-1p.FPThe differences between the alternative expressions in (75) are subtle. In
general, a pronoun copy of a nominal constituent within the same sentence gives
emphasis to this participant. Such extra focus is given then to Ben in (75) (b)
and (75) (d). The explicit Beneficiary seems to be restricted to Action verbs [ +
Go], i.e. some verbs with the feature [ + Control]. The incorporated Beneficiary
does not necessarily imply that this participant benefits from the action. It
may in fact be adversely affected (recall example (44) in 4.2.9, which
illustrates this with a process verb).
The incorporation of Ben in the verb conveys a greater degree of
affectedness of the Beneficiary, as is the case in (75) (c) and (d). The latter
fact is borne out by the restriction on the co-occurrence of Ben with process
verbs and the verb igo. An explicit term Ben is not allowed with these verbs.
The following example is unacceptable:(76)*narau

verbs [+ Go], speech verbs, motion and perception verbs. With the latter three
classes the semantic restrictions are of course heavy, and only very few items
can be used as Ins: 'eyes' with 'to see', 'ears' with 'to hear', etc.
However, the semantic richness of many action verbs results in equally
strong selection restrictions. For example, gumat 'stab' is almost exclusively
done with an qauri ""spear'. Frequently, because of the restriction on the number
of terms per predicate, Ins is expressed as Go of a preceding predication and
understood in the predication that follows, as in :(79)wobeiheaxe Go take tree cut-3s.FPbanamsu-erei[= sorei]'He took an axe and cut the tree'When an Ins is expressed in the same clause as the Ag and Go, it is done so
mainly to contrast it with possible other Instruments. Alternatively, Go may be
expressed in a preceding clause and Ins in the following one. In this case Ins
has to be marked with the postposition -t:(80)wagar
arrowiring ba
rmut-et
i.
take fire-with I n siset
wogub

roast.SS cease.SS and'He took the iring arrow, roasted it in the fire and ...'","[172, 173, 174]"
"Qaulifying adjectives may be used both in attributive and predicative
positions. If no determiner or quantifier is present, it is difficult to
ascertain which of the two positions is occupied in a verbless clause, since
Usan lacks copula verbs. The verb 'to stay' or 'to be' igo may occasionally be
used as such, but, in the case of an adjectival predication, it is more often
absent than present. If a quantifier or determiner is present, the criterion
for determining whether the qualifier is used attributively or predicatively is
whether it precedes or follows these two categories. Compare(50) (a) qâsuri nanat eng

"(NOTE: One could possibly construe a situation where a boy habitually givesyam223SUBORDINATIONto someone, say, a very important individual, and identify the food
withthegivingboyexpression in (36) (a). In that case the recipient u- would not referto the head noun wau 'child', buttothereceiver. The construction remains highlyimportantindividualwhoisthequestionable though.)Nominalized clauses, which may theoretically be rather complex (cf. 4.1.1
(4)), may only modify head nouns referring to the agent of the action, the time,
place or manner.
If such nominalized clauses are seen as instances of a RC
strategy, then Usan violates the accessibility hierarchy set up by Keenan and
Comrie (1977). A similar problem is posed by the prenominal RCs in Usan, to
which we will now turn. I shall compare the prenominal strategy with the far
more frequent one of the replacive RC.","[240, 241]"
"3.2.2NominalizationVerbs are nominalized by affixing -au to the stem, which is at the same
time the form of the singular imperative. For the verbs of conjugations 4a and
4c this results in a change of the stem vowel /o/ into /â/, while the verbs of
conjugations 6 and 7 elide the vowel /o/ of the imperative form (see table 1 ) .
Nominalized verbs function as nouns or as adjectives. In this respect,
Usan nominalized verbs resemble the progressive participles of English and other
Indo-European languages. Compare the English forms in (15) with the Usan forms
in (16).(15) (a)

"1.1 The Usan as a_ speech community1.1.1 Location of Usan in relation to neighboring groupsHow does a language get its name? Quite a few languages in Papua New
Guinea are known by their word for "" w h a t "" , "" m a n "" , """"hand"", or simply by a
name neighbors used for the speakers of a language. Certain languages are known
by a variety of names, given by various explorers, missionaries, government
officials or others. When Z'graggen did his comparative work on the languages
in the Madang province during the late sixties (cf. Z'graggen 1971), he found
many languages for which no name was available. In those cases he named the
language after the largest village. One such language he named Wanuma, a member
of the Numugenan family. Language families Z'graggen named after a major river
in the area of a family of languages. The Numugen is known by the Usan as
Ibirin. Wanuma is derived from the Usan name Wonum, which designates one of the
eleven territorial groups.",[22]

"STRUCTURES AND THEIR FUNCTIONS IN USAN1825.1.1On so-called 'gapping' constructionsGapping constructions involve two (or more) instances of some state of
affairs, with different sets of terms. That is to say, the semantic and
syntactic function of the terms with respect to the predicate expressing the
state of affairs are the same, but their referential meanings are different.
One could say that in 'gapping' constructions the same scene is played with
different actors and/or props, which are then contrasted with each other.
It is the contrastive function of 'gapping' constructions that seems to me
of crucial importance. As Kuno (1976a:310) states as his assumption regarding
the intended function of Gapping: ""namely that of deleting contextually known
information and presenting contrastive (and therefore, new, unpredictable)
information."" Because of this function, there are many Usan constructions that
I believe to be related to Gapping, even if they may not look 'canonical gapping
constructions.' Beginning with Ross (1970), the theory has existed that gapping
possibilities are related to the ordering of constituents, in such a way that
SOV languages have either two possible Gapping constructions (SOV + SO and SO +
SOV) or just the one order SO + SOV. The latter case would hold for languages
that are strictly V-final. Now, Usan, even though it is strictly V-final, has
as the only possible gapping order SOV + SO, as in (21) (a); (21) (b) is
impossible.(21) (a)Seiru purat
S.(b)*Seiru purat
S.wâr-aneye qombbird.of.paradise shoot-3s.DS and Ineye qombbird.of.paradise and IGoura.pigeonw-ameiGoura.pigeon shoot-Is.FPA formal account of (21) (a) may be given by the general schema of (17)
with the necessary ordering principles, as in Dik (1980:207), with the proviso
that Usan's V-final nature does NOT have the strictly V-final pattern as e.g. in
Dutch subordinate clauses. That is, Usan requires that for coordination of term
n-tuples, ( α2) .... ( αm) is expressed following the complete expression of
V( α 1 ) .
In natural text, we also find sequences such as:(22)gobanu-t-ib-einereng waieng gobanshoulder him-give-sg.Fut-3s.UF the animal the shoulderu-t-ib-a
him-give-sg.Fut-3s183COORDINATION AND SWITCH-REFERENCE'To the one who 1 may give him j a shoulder, h e j will

u-t-ib-einer
eng qur
and belly him-give-sg.Fut-3s.UF the belly'And to the one who may give him a belly, a belly'The difference between (21) (a) and (22) is that in the former the first
conjunct has the predicate in a medial verb form, whereas in the latter example
the first conjunct is a fully expressed sentence with a final verb,
receiving
final intonation. This also appears to be the case in Korafe, another Papuan
SOV language:(23) Korafe: Mary nu isia mindira,
John nu kuta
M.
she taro she.ate.TP J.
he sweet.potato'Mary ate taro, John sweet potato'
(data from Cindy Farr, pers. comm.)The occurrence of sequences such as (22) and (23) suggests that 'gapping'
constructions, in Papuan languages at least, may originate from another source
than the expansion schema (17). The fact that the first sentence in (22) forms a
complete grammatical sentence with final intonation indicates that the second
sentence is the expression of a separate predication whose predicate is not
realized. Such a non-realization rule would be similar to zero anaphora when the
appropriate constituent has been mentioned in a preceding sentence.
Whether constructions such as in (22) and (23) are achieved by expansion or
non-realization(seebelow),theydoprovide,inmy view, instances of anexclusive SOV + SO configuration for SOV languages, which Ross (19 70) and others
haveruledout.","[199, 200, 201]"

has aninvariable ending, which is sometimes zero.
Languages such as Waskia (Ross and Paol 1978) and Siroi (Wells 1978) which
both belong to the Madang-Adelbert sub-phylum may be said to illustrate schema
(9). However, in both these languages, the DS medial verbs are morphologically
indistinguishable from final verbs. This means that DS medial verbs are affixed
for tense and subject person-number as final verbs are.
Usan also represents schema (9).
It is typologically
similar
to
Finisterre-Huon languages in this respect. The SS medial forms have endings
that vary only according to the verb conjugation. The DS medial forms indicate
person-number of the subject of the medial verb. The medial subject affixes
differ considerably from the affixes on final verbs: second and third person
are neutralized and their forms are totally different (cf. 3.9.1).
Haiman claims that from a morphological standpoint all medial verbs are
nominalizations (1980:xlviii). His arguments are based upon data showing that
the anticipatory subject affix in (8) is a personal pronoun in East-Central
languages, and, secondly, that medial verbs may co-occur with a number of
suffixes whose distribution is confined to nominal expressions. I am not
convinced by his arguments.
Firstly, Usan as well as the Finisterre-Huon languages do not indicate the
anticipatory
subject
in
the
morphology
of
medial verbs.
Secondly,
nominalization of verbs requires different affixation (cf. 3.2.1 and 3.9.1).
Thirdly, not only medial verbs but also final verbs used sentence-medially may
co-occur with material that is confined to nominal expressions (cf. chapter 6 ) .
Fourthly, Haiman himself suggests that the medial desinence in Fore and other
East-Central languages is possibly derived from the connector gi
'and', which
also occurs as a phrasal conjunction. I do not see why a construction like 'I
did something and (then) he...' should imply that the predication 'I did
something' must be nominalized.",[36]
"As in so many other languages, a request can also be made by asking whether
it will be the case in the future that the addressee does a particular action:(86) narau

4c yields yemb-âm etc. for singular subjects and yomb-oun for plural subjects.
Soae verbs display irregularity. The class of causative verbs, which have
their SS medial end with -si (not siâb), have future forms like conjugation 4a,
i.e. -si-erib — s i - o r u b .
So does the process class of verbs, formed with some
nouns and adjectives with -t(er), e.g. qoyam 'knowledge' >
qoyamet 'become
knowledgeable' , which yields qoyamterib and qoyamtorub as future stems. The
verb diâb 'come up', even though behaving like other verbs of class 4d,
nevertheless follows the 4a class in the future tense: di-erib.",[116]
"6.3.2ConclusionAll conditionals are found in sentence-initial position, in accordance with
Greenberg's universal # 14 (1966:66). Besides that, they are also marked with
the topic marker, which in many languages also indicates the term containing the
relative clause. What these constructions have in common is that they function
as presuppositions.
They form the ground for the assertion of the main clause.
The cited morphogical and syntactic evidence for Papuan and African
languages CHutchison 1980 gives other convincing evidence from Kanuri) suggests
that the close relationship between conditionals, relative clauses and topical
noun phrases is not accidental. In fact, this typological evidence points to a
possibly universal feature of language. The pragmatic feature of presupposition
seems to motivate the syntactic structure of given noun phrases, relative
clauses and conditionals with respect to their position and morphological
marking .",[262]
"6.6PurposePurpose is a subcategory of the psychological concept 'reason'. The reason
for doing an action X is often that some other state of affairs will eventuate
or be prevented.
Purpose clauses make explicit what speakers interpret the
intention of certain action to be. In particular actions that are ascribed to
agents can easily be, and often are, conceived of as being done with some
intention (Searle 1980).
I indicated earlier that various features of topics and subordinate clauses
could be 'explained' by reference to the metaphor DISCOURSE is SPACE. A
corollary of this metaphor is the conduit metaphor, which treats concepts as
containers, messages as going through channels (Reddy 1980). The notion of
intention may also be understood in terms of spatial or possessive relations.
We shall see in this section that purpose clauses in many Papuan languages are
different from the subordinate clauses discussed so far.
But before I present
various Usan constructions, it may be fruitful to point out some striking
similarities in some languages between purpose constructions and locative or
benefactive constituents. In 6.5 I showed how reason can be identified by means
of some locative element or the adpositions that are being
used
for
beneficiaries. The question 'Why did you do that?' may be answered be referring
to some preceding event (cause or reason) or to some following event (purpose).
This following event is the 'goal' of the main predication. Notice, as Searle
has made clear, that the intention as a mental event MUST precede the action, if
the action is to be called intentional. In other words, the mental event is the
reason or cause of the action.
When one gives something to someone, the recipient is the goal of that
action.
This presumably accounts for the fact that the semantic function
Recipient in many languages can easily be realized as syntactic Object. When I
do something for someone's benefit, again, this is the goal of my action. When
one goes to some place, one's destination is the goal of one's action.
Conceptually, all of these goals are rather similar.
This similarity is
reflected in the morphology and syntax of many languages, even though different
languages may divide the basic concept of 'goal' up into different components.
Consider the following English sentences:(113) (a) I gave this book to John
(b) The woman went to the store
(c) What I wanted to say...
(d) She watered the plants to let them grow better255SUBORDINATIONPurpose in English makes use of the same preposition as Goal.
Maybe not
many English speakers would recognize _to in (113) as the same word in all
instances. I would suggest that this failure is due to the same reason why dead
metaphors are no longer recognized as metaphors. Diachronic processes may not
reflect psychological reality, yet they do help to explain constructions that
are found in a synchronic description of a language. In Reesink (1982) I noted
as a significant fact that rather diverse languages use locative markers on
verbs with a purposive, or infinitive, character. Compare the English examples
of (113) with the Siroi locative -am in (114) and the infinitive marker -am in
the purpose clause in (115) (Wells 1978:8 and 86):(114) turnail-am
face-Loc(115) kite'in front of'ye pastor tuku fonde kus-amtoday Ipastor fork-atfence tie-Intent go-1s.Im.Pa'Today I went to fix the pastor's fence'When such diverse languages agree in marking purposives and loatives in the same
way, this may indicate some universal tendency to employ the metaphorDISCOURSEis SPACE: an intended event is like a spatial goal or reference point.","[272, 273]"
"STRUCTURES AND THEIR FUNCTIONS IN USAN1244.1.2The structure of the clauseOne of the typological characteristics of Usan is the predominance of verbs
and verb sequences, as mentioned in the introduction (1.1.3). In natural speech
there are very few utterances for which only one verb suffices. Most states of
affairs are expressed by combinations of verbs, many of which are highly
restrictive with regard to their semantic loading.
This makes explicit
reference to semantic functions in most cases redundant. Therefore the present
section as well as the one discussing semantic functions, is not as illustrative
of the typical nature of Usan as for example the chapters on coordination and
subordination.
Since sentences are mostly formed by the two mechanisms of coordination and
subordination of clauses the linguistic expression of a predication is termed
'clause'. However, I do not mean to imply some significant theoretical
difference between clause and sentence as one finds, for example, in Tagmemic
theory. Corresponding to the language independent schema given in Dik (1978),
we can adopt the schema (7) for Usan.","[141, 142]"
