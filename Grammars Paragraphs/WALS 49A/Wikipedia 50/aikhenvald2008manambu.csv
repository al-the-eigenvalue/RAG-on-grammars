This is a grammar of Manambu, a language of the Ndu family, which is, in terms of numbers of
speakers, the largest language family of the Sepik area of New Guinea. Manambu is spoken by
about 2,500 people in ﬁve villages—three of which, Avatip, Malu, and Yambon, are suﬃciently
big to appear on most maps of Papua New Guinea. I started studying the language in 1995,
as part of my work on classiﬁers, genders, and noun classes. I was interested in learning a
language with shape-based genders. Alan Rumsey was teaching a ﬁeld methods course at
the ANU, with Pauline Agnes Luma Laki as a consultant. I came along to the course, and
then carried on working with Pauline for more than ten years afterwards—this is how my
voyage of discovery started. I have since worked with several dozen speakers of Manambu,
mostly in Avatip. Pauline Agnes Luma Laki and myself are currently engaged in preparing a
comprehensive dictionary of the language.
This grammar contains an analysis of the Manambu language, starting from a brief characterization of the language and its speakers, then going on to phonology, morphology, syntax,
discourse organization, and semantics. The analysis is cast in terms of a cumulative typological
framework of linguistic analysis—which employs ‘the fundamental theoretical concepts that
underlie all work in language description and change’ (Dixon 1997: 128) and in terms of which
signiﬁcant typological generalizations are postulated; this has come to be called ‘basic linguistic
theory’. I have avoided employing any transient formalisms. This grammar is part of genuine
documentation of the Manambu language in its varied facets.
Every chapter of the grammar includes a presentation of the facts of the language interwoven
with arguments for their analysis within a typological framework. No attempt has been made
to separate pure ‘description’ from theoretical interpretation—which would not be a productive
task. A typological perspective for each phenomenon is crucial for the analysis given here.
Detailed exempliﬁcation is provided for every grammatical point. Most examples come
from texts, and a few from spontaneous—or carefully directed—conversation. An additional
objective was to convey as much of the Manambu culture as possible through using naturally
occurring examples. I avoid using elicited sentences; elicitation was limited to lexicon and to
paradigms.
English glosses are kept as close as possible to the glosses and explanations oﬀered by
my consultants. Readers should be warned against trying to draw conclusions concerning
Manambu grammar and semantics from study of the translations.
Examples, tables, diagrams, ﬁgures, charts, and footnotes are numbered separately within
each chapter. Footnotes are also numbered separately for each chapter. The orthography used
in the examples from languages other than Manambu, and language names, follows that of the
sources (unless indicated otherwise).
This grammar can be used as a sourcebook for further typological studies, and as a model
for further grammars of languages of the Ndu and of other families of the New Guinea area.
It is far from being the last word on Manambu—the grammar is intended to provide a sound
systematic foundation for further studies, reanalyses, and reinterpretations.
It is my hope that this book will encourage linguists to go out into the ﬁeld and document
languages threatened by extinction (before it is too late to do so). Nothing can compare with
the intellectual excitement of working out the grammatical system of a previously undescribed
language.","[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16]"

⎭steadfast rule: if another constituent is more topical than the O, then it will be cross-referenced.
We saw in 3.7 above that, with the verb ‘give’, either the gift or the recipient can be crossreferenced, depending on their topicality. Only the ‘gift’ can be marked with accusative/locative,
while the recipient is always marked with dative.
In 3.14, the place which is the topic of the stretch of discourse is cross-referenced on the verb
(with the feminine gender form). The indeﬁnite direct object, unmarked for case, is not.
3.14 a-d@
jag@r vyapra-tua-l
dem-masc.sg garﬁsh shoot-1sgsubj.vt-3fem.sgbas.vt
‘I shoot that garﬁsh (in this place we are in now)’
Alternatively, a completely aﬀected O marked with the accusative/locative case may be less
topical than the subject, especially if the verb is marked with the action focus -na-. In 3.15,
the angry man is determined to exterminate the moon who, as he thinks, is responsible for his
wife’s menstruation. The moon is marked for case and is the topic of the story, but is not crossreferenced: the action focus -na- shows that the focus is on the action and it is more important
than the O.

3.15Table 3.6 lists the examples illustrating the correlations between case marking and crossreferencing of O.
We conclude that cross-referencing on verbs and case marking on nouns follow diﬀerent
principles. Verbs distinguish between subject and (topical) non-subject, while nouns operate on
a principle reminiscent of nominative-accusative. In addition, nouns distinguish a rather large
number of forms for non-core participants. We return to the discussion of cases in Chapter 7.3.3 ‘ r e ac t i vat e d t o pi c’ d e m o n s t rat i v e s
There are three series of demonstratives marking ‘reactivated topic’—k@- series ‘proximal to
the speaker’, wa- series ‘proximal to the hearer’, and a- series ‘distant from both’ (discussed in
detail in §10.2.3). These always agree in gender and number with the S/O argument. They are
employed to bring an already established topic ‘back to action’, if it has not been mentioned
for some time. Consider 3.16, said to 5-year-old Kerryanne who was running around at a
local market, to remind her of the existence of her mother and myself (whom she ought to
be following):
yi-na-b@r
3.16 abra
dem.dist.react.top+dual go-act.foc-3dubas.vt
‘Those two are going!’ (I am reminding you of them; or else you will be left behind)
If an O constituent is a reactivated topic, it is obligatorily cross-referenced on the verb (using
the basic set in the second cross-referencing position). In 3.17, the bundle of sago established
as a topic in the previous stretch of discourse is mentioned again. Since it is topical, it is also
cross-referenced on the verb:
3.17 na:gw ada
ka-war-la-d
sago dem.dist.react.top+masc.sg carry-go.up-3fem.sgsubj.vt-3masc.sgbas.vt
‘She has carried up that previously mentioned sago’
With the ditransitive verb ‘give’, a reactivated topic marker refers to the recipient rather
than the gift if it is more animate than the gift, unless the gift is more topical. Example 3.18
comes from a story about a man (the topic of the whole story) who was considered dead by
his relatives. In the previous stretch of text the ﬂying fox who had been looking after the man
tells him that his relatives were arranging a mortuary feast for him. The man has not been
mentioned for a paragraph or so. Then, it turns out that the preparations for the mortuary
feast for the man are under way at the man’s house. The man is thus ‘brought back’ into the
text as the reactivated topic. The mortuary feast, in the O function in 3.18, is the gift; the
‘reactivated topic demonstrative’, and the cross-referencing on the verb, refer to the man:703 Grammatical Relationskui-da-d

‘They were giving mortuary feast to him (the reactivated topic)’
We will see, in §10.2.3, that a reactivated topic demonstrative can refer to the S of an
ambitransitive verb used intransitively. It can also refer to a location, as in 10.68. The content
of a direct speech report is never referred to with such a demonstrative. The problem of whether
the reactivated topic demonstrative forms one NP with a noun it refers to or not is discussed
in §10.2.3.
The predominantly absolutive (S/O) basis for the reactivated topic markers agrees with a
cross-linguistic tendency for a correlation between the S/O function and topicality (Du Bois
1987). That a demonstrative should operate on an absolutive basis is hardly surprising—in
Dyirbal and a few other languages, an NP including a nominal demonstrative may only occur
in S or O function (Dixon 2003: 83, 94–99; Aikhenvald and Dixon forthcoming). Reactivated
topic demonstratives provide a strong criterion for S (see, for instance, the discussion of
polyfunctional verbs and their argument structure in §4.2.2). The subject of a verbless clause or
head of non-verbal predicate is hardly ever referred to with the reactivated topic demonstrative
(the implication of this is that it is not treated on a par with S arguments).3.4 gra m m at i c a l r e lat i o n s i n m a na m bu: a s ummary
Cross-referencing on the verb and case marking on nouns in Manambu operate on diﬀerent
principles. The choice of cross-referencing depends on the tense-aspect-mood and polarity, and
on the presence of a participant more topical than the subject. Case marking is reminiscent
of a nominative-accusative system, with the occurrence of the object case depending on the
deﬁniteness and the degree of involvement of the O. Systems of this kind are cross-linguistically
attested (see Aikhenvald 1994 for a brief survey).
Cross-referencing on the verb is more unusual. It follows a subject-non-subject principle. The
subject of a verb, be it A or S, always has to be cross-referenced. Any non-subject constituent—
with the exception of copula complement, transportative, comitative, and substitutive constituents, and speech reports—can be cross-referenced. (This is reminiscent of Alamblak, from
the Sepik Hill family.) The same, ‘basic’, marking is used for cross-referencing the subject (A/S)
with no other topical constituent; and for cross-referencing a topical non-subject. In addition,
all of the A/S of all verbs are marked in the same way. The subject of a non-verbal predicate
head acquires a somewhat diﬀerent marking, and does not distinguish tense.
In addition, three series of demonstratives marking ‘reactivated topic’ operate on an absolutive basis, marking gender and number agreement with the topical S/O argument which is then
highly likely to be cross-referenced on the verb.
The three ways of marking grammatical relations allow for a highly elaborate way of specifying the topicality of participants and the involvement and deﬁniteness of the object.
A historical note is in order. The dependent marking on nouns appears older than the
unusual system of verbal cross-referencing. Cases for core arguments are a shared feature
of Ndu languages, while the personal marking of two arguments on verbs appears to be a
Manambu innovation also shared with Gala. Iatmul has only subject cross-referencing which
appears to be a relatively recent innovation.","[94, 95, 96, 97]"

d@y, dayNo cross-referencing is found in negative declarative non-habitual clauses, in positive completive and customary aspects and in a variety of non-declarative forms including prohibitive,
desiderative, and frustrative, and all same-subject medial clauses. These forms are uninﬂected.
See a summary in Table 11.1.
The number of cross-referencing positions on the verb only marginally relates to mood,
modality, polarity, and aspect. Most of the verbal forms which accept one cross-referencing
position or take no cross-referencing are non-declarative. Most negative forms take no crossreferencing at all.
The number of cross-referencing positions is independent of the verb’s transitivity. It
depends on the pragmatic properties of the non-subject constituent, and not so much the
lexical properties of the verb itself. This is partly reminiscent of Ugric and Samoyedic
languages.
There, a special verbal conjugation (called ‘objective’) is used for transitive verbs if the
object is deﬁnite or topical. A transitive verb with an indeﬁnite object appears in the ‘subjective’ conjugation (see, for instance, Moravcsik 1983 on Hungarian and Nikolaeva 1999 on
Northern Khanty). Diﬀerent sets of cross-referencing suﬃxes in Menya, an Angan language
from Morobe Province, Papua New Guinea (Whitehead 1991), mark more topical, and less
topical, subjects. However, in neither case is there a complete analogy with the Manambu
system.
The marking of A/S as the only cross-referenced constituent (‘basic’ marking set) is the same
as the marking of the second argument if it is more topical than the subject. This may seem
reminiscent of split ergativity whereby, under certain conditions, the S constituent (the only

a transitive verb). 1 However, the Manambu pattern is only superﬁcially similar to this, since:
(a) the basic cross-referencing set marks A/S and also O, a locative, a manner, or a time
constituent, that is, it is hardly comparable with a ‘real’ ergative/absolutive system, with
an opposition between S/O and A; and
(b) the occurrence of the marking is conditioned by the topicality of the participant and
only partly by its grammatical function (we can recall that some relations, such as copula
complement, or comitative, are never cross-referenced).
The closest analogy to the Manambu system comes from Alamblak (Sepik Hill: Bruce 1984:
184–8, 216–30). Here, an argument additional to the subject can be cross-referenced on the
verb ‘if it can be thought of as a crucial participant in the situation’ (219). Just as in Manambu,
the second argument marker follows the marker of the subject. However, unlike Manambu,
the same set of markers cross-references both arguments, and there are no special sets for nonverbal predicates. It is not clear whether there are any types of arguments which can never be
cross-referenced. Sare (or Kapriman), also from the Sepik Hill family, does not have this feature
(Sumbuk 1999). Is this similarity between Manambu and Alamblak a simple coincidence? Or,
given that some Manambu subclans claim their origins to be in the area of Chambri lake—
to the south of which Alamblak is spoken (see §1.5.3)—could this be an areal feature? The
question remains open. Also see §§22.2–3, where we return to the issue of areal diﬀusion.
We conclude that, though marking the pragmatic status of constituents through variation in
cross-referencing patterns on the verb is not unprecedented, no other system we know of is
fully comparable with the way Manambu verbs mark their participants.3.2 gramm atical relat ions marked on noun phrases
Cases in Manambu mark grammatical relations on a basic nominative-accusative principle.
Only deﬁnite and completely aﬀected objects are marked with the -Vm case ‘accusative/
locative’ (see §7.3 for a hypothesis concerning the motivation for this case syncretism). Table
3.5 summarizes the principles of dependent marking on nouns, and how these correlate with
the marking on verbs as heads of predicates.
Table 3.5 shows that grammatical functions covered by the second-position cross-referencing
suﬃxes only somewhat overlap with the ones covered by cases. The case syncretism does not
fully coincide with the syncretism of meanings available for the basic cross-referencing set
when it refers to a non-subject constituent. We can recall that this may refer to location (for
which three cases are available: a location can be unmarked, marked with a locative case or
the terminative case); to an object (one case available), or to an instrument or manner (one
case available). This illustrates one-to-many correspondences in the relationship between crossreferencing on the verb and case marking on nouns. Case meanings below the thick line in
Table 3.5 do not have a cross-referencing correlate: these constituents are not cross-referenced.
An object marked with the accusative/locative case is likely to be a topic, and is crossreferenced more often than an unmarked O, in terms of textual frequency. However, this is not a
1 Instances whereby a language has an ergative pattern of marking grammatical relations depending on the topical
continuity of S/O include Asheninca Campa (an Arawak language from Peru: Payne and Payne (2005) showed how
a split intransitive pattern marks the main story line, or foregrounded actions). In Yagua (Peba-Yagua) and Pajonal
Campa (Arawak), S is marked like O to highlight some new information (but not a new participant) (Dixon 1994:
211).","[91, 92, 93, 94]"

This grammar has been written as an integrated whole. To understand what follows one needs
to have digested what precedes. Chapter 1 provides a quick overview of the main points of the
Manambu grammar. Later chapters deal with a particular grammatical topic each.
Chapter 3 discusses the ways in which grammatical relations are expressed. This chapter
is basic for understanding the rest of the grammar. Chapter 2 contains a detailed discussion
of phonology; it is not necessary to read to understand the rest of the grammar. Chapter 4
gives an overview of all the word classes, and Chapter 11 concentrates on the organization
of verbal morphology, giving a preview of Chapters 12–17. Chapters 18 and 19 deal with
complex clauses. Chapter 20 draws together the structure of clausal constituents, clauses, and
sentences, and discusses the principles and functions of constituent order and of order of
grammatical words within each constituent. Issues in semantics are addressed in Chapter 21.
Those interested in cultural background and historical and comparative problems are advised
to focus on Chapters 1 and 22.
Examples are numbered separately for each chapter. Examples from texts at the end of the
grammar are referred to with the letter T followed by the number of the text and the sentence
(that is, T2.40 refers to sentence 40 of Text 2).
All the examples and texts are supplied with an interlinear morpheme gloss, and then translated into English. Homophonous morphemes are diﬀerentiated by their glosses. The symbol
‘+’ is used to indicate fused morphemes, e.g. taba- is glossed as ‘hand+lk’, its underlying form
being ta:b ‘hand’ (with the long vowel shortened when the linker is added) and -a- ‘linker’.
Portmanteau morphemes are glossed with ‘:’, for instance, mæy ‘come:impv’. All grammatical
morphemes are glossed in small caps while lexical morphemes are in lower case. Pronominal
preﬁxes are shown as 1sg, 3pl, in lower case. For polysemous morphemes, diﬀerent translations
in glosses correspond to diﬀerent meanings.
Cross-references are of two kinds:
r Those preceded by § refer to chapter and section number: for instance, §11.1 refers to
section 1 of Chapter 11;
r Those beginning with a number refer to examples in the grammar: for instance, 11.1 refers
to example 1 in Chapter 11.","[20, 21, 22, 23, 24]"

Case Marking
7.1 f o r m at i o n o f c a s e s : a n ov e rv i ew
Manambu has a system of nine case forms. One can distinguish nine cases each corresponding
to a form. By their functions and meanings, one can distinguish eighteen cases. At the end of
this chapter, we argue for an intermediate solution.
Core cases mark grammatical relations on a basic object–non-object principle (see §3.2).
Table 3.5 summarizes the principles of dependent marking on nouns, and how these correlate
with the cross-referencing of arguments on verbs as heads of predicates. All cases, except for the
comitative, can only be marked once per NP. Case markers occur on the head of an NP (which
is, in most instances, also the last word in the NP; the few exceptions include comitative, and
NPs with cardinal numbers, such as ‘three’ in 7.50, and quantiﬁers: see §§10.5–6; §20.1.1). Casemarked forms, and Ø-marked nouns, are underlined throughout this chapter. Some cases can
occur on verb stems and forms: see §7.11.
Case markers attach to a linker whose choice depends on the subclass of nouns (§4.1.1). The
sequence of linker -a and the V in accusative-locative, dative, and allative-instrumental cases
results in a long vowel a:. If the linker is @, the V of the case marker disappears. Third person
singular and dual pronouns and the interrogative s@ ‘who’ take the oblique marker -k@- as a
linker (homophonous with the possessive marker -k@- discussed in §8.2).7.2 f unct ions of a noun unmarked for case
A noun unmarked for case appears as (A) A/S and copula subject, (B) copula complement,
(C) the second argument of verbs of ‘turning into’; (D) object; (E) manner; (F) locations;
(G) purpose; (H) instrument; and also (I) nominal component of complex verbs. Topics and
afterthoughts also appear unmarked, no matter what function they are in.
A. Subjects (A/S and copula subjects) do not receive any formal marking, as shown in 4.16–17,
4.35–6, and 7.1 below. All subjects are cross-referenced on the verb (see §3.1). Their subject
properties (including behaviour in clause chaining) are summarized in §20.1.4.
B. Copula complements are also formally unmarked (see §7.9, for one exception); unlike other
non-subject arguments, they are never cross-referenced on the verb, as shown in 3.8–9 and 7.1
(also see discussion of copula verbs under B in §4.2.2).

C. The second argument of the verbs of change of state and turning into is formally unmarked
and not cross-referenced on the verb, as illustrated in 3.10, 7.2, and 15.116.","[170, 171]"

7.2 ta:kw2nd.argument saw@l-na
woman
be.transformed-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt emph
‘(The mango) turned into a woman’
These verbs are similar to copula verbs in that their second argument (which denotes a kind)
is obligatory and cannot be cross-referenced on the verb itself.
D. An object can be formally unmarked if it is indeﬁnite, non-referential, or generic, as in 3.14,
4.31–2, and 7.3, or its complete involvement in the activity is not in focus, as in 4.29–30 and
4.34–6. A topical object can be cross-referenced in the second position (see §3.1).
k@-kwa-na-wun
7.3 wun wali-kamna:gw ak@s

I
‘I never eat white people’s food’
In idiomatic expressions the object is always unmarked, as in T1.4 and 7.16, bap v@‘menstruate’, literally ‘see moon’. The object of the verb nay- ‘play’ is always unmarked, e.g.
politics nay- ‘play politics’, t@ p@t@ p@ka:u nay- (diving play) ‘play at diving’; it cannot be crossreferenced.
If the focus is on the activity (and this is marked with action focus -na-), the object is likely
to be unmarked:
b@
luku kur-na-di
7.4 [wun-a-di kaukau]
sweet.potato already steal get-act.foc-3plbas.vt
I-lk-pl
‘They already stole my sweet potatoes’
This is in contrast to 3.15 and 7.17 where the case-marked referents are completely involved
in the activity (see §7.3). Personal pronouns and proper names are usually case marked, unless
the grammatical relations are clear from the context. An example like 7.5 or 10.64 is unusual
(it was a cry of surprise by Gemaj when she realized I was carrying water into the house):
7.5 wun ñ@n ma: v@
you neg see+neg
I
‘I didn’t see you!’
E. A noun referring to the manner in which an action is performed appears unmarked for
case, as in 7.6. The manner is the topic, and so it is cross-referenced on the verb in the second
cross-referencing position. Manner is typically feminine (see §5.2.1).
7.6 sad-@-sa:d kur-l@-l
way-lk-way got-3fem.sgsubj.p-3fem.sgbas.p
‘It was in a variety of ways that she (cassowary) got him (the human child)’
In 7.7, the crocodile surfaces in diﬀerent form, disguised as diﬀerent beings. These forms are
what this stretch of the text is about, which explains the feminine cross-referencing on the verb.

the meaning ‘turn into’ (under C above). While the second argument of such verbs is obligatory
(that is, a sentence like 7.2 would be ungrammatical without it), form and manner in 7.6–7 are
optional.
F. Nouns referring to location, direction, and provenance can occur unmarked for case. This is
typical for inherently locational nouns and place names (see §4.1.2), as in 4.1, 7.8, and 13.34,
or if the direction is obvious, as in 4.56.

A noun which is not inherently locational can occur without locative marking if it obviously
refers to a location, as in 7.9 (‘nose’ of a canoe):

An unmarked noun can refer to direction, as in 7.10, and to provenance ‘from’, as in 7.11, if
these meanings are recoverable from the context and the verbs have directional semantics.

Inherently temporal nouns often occur unmarked, as in 4.3.
G. Nouns expressing purpose can be unmarked if the purpose meaning is clear from the
context, as in 7.12a; in this cases dative case would be expected, as in 7.12b (see §7.4).

Nominalizations in -ka:u occur unmarked (see §9.1.2):
7.13 kak@l-ka:u yi-k-na-b@r
surpass-nom go-fut-act.foc-3dubas.vt
‘They two were about to go for races’
H. Instruments can occur unmarked if the instrumental meaning is clear from the context, as
in 7.14:7.3 Accusative-locative case1477.14 ta:b kayk@t@-n
hand hold/lean-seq
‘Holding (him with) a hand’
A formally unmarked noun can be used to describe a property of an inanimate entity, as in
17.63–4, e.g. day yi v@r-k-na (mouth ﬁre burn-fut-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt) ‘Mouth will burn’
(lit. burn in terms of ﬁre) (if you eat hot pepper).
Functions E–H correspond to oblique arguments, none of which is required by the verb’s
argument structure.
I. Nominal components of complex verbs are always unmarked and never cross-referenced on
the verb. As shown in §4.1.2, these nominal components are often body parts, e.g. s@ p ‘skin’
in s@p ji- and s@p sakwi- both meaning ‘be fed up’, or states, e.g. ka:m ‘hunger’, as in ka:m
yas- ‘feel hunger’, and s@ ‘sleep’ as in s@ kwa- ‘be asleep’ and s@ yasa- ‘feel sleepy’. Other
nouns include gu ‘water’ in gu yaku- (water wash) ‘bathe; wash oneself’, sua:l ‘lie, story’ in
sua:l kur- (lie do) and sua:l taka- (lie put) ‘tell a lie’, and yanu ‘magic’ in yanu bla- (magic talk)
‘cast a magic spell’. (Similar constructions, e.g. gu ya:ku- ‘wash’, are attested in Iatmul: Gerd
Jendraschek, p.c.)
The nominal component cannot be cross-referenced on the verb. Unlike any other argument,
it cannot be questioned, focused, or negated separately. One cannot ask ‘what is she putting’,
and receive a reply ‘a lie’; one cannot say ‘it is a lie that she is putting’. This is because it is not
part of the verb’s argument structure. Further analysis of complex verbs is in §17.3.
Topics and afterthoughts occur unmarked, no matter what functions they are in. In 4.35, ‘child’
is an afterthought, and is separated from the rest of the clause with a pause. Case markers are
mutually exclusive with derivational suﬃxes -d@ka ‘only’, -r@b ‘fully’, -p@k ‘like’, and -k@r @b
‘together’, as in 10.147. (See §9.2.)
The functions and meanings of formally unmarked nouns in Manambu are summarized
in Table 7.1. Zero-marked nouns vary in terms of their functions discussed above and (1) how
obligatory they are; (2) whether they can or cannot be cross-referenced on the verb; (3) whether
they can alternate with a case-marked noun; and (4) whether they can be replaced with an
unmarked personal pronoun.
We conclude that zero-case marking in Manambu has nine diﬀerent meanings and functions
corresponding to the contexts A–I outlined here. Nouns in contexts A–E can be considered zero marked for case since zero is in paradigmatic contrast to segmental marking. In
contrast, nouns in contexts F–H are better considered as formally unmarked since there
is an underlying case form which can be omitted thus producing a surface zero (location can be marked with locative case, purpose with dative, and instrument with allativeinstrumental). Not all case markers can be omitted: there are no unmarked comitatives,
transportatives, or substitutives. Components of complex verbs are not special grammatical
relations.7.3 acc us at i v e -lo c at i v e c a s e
The accusative-locative case has two major functions discussed below.
A. Direct objects and recipients are marked with the accusative-locative case under the
following conditions.","[171, 172, 173, 174]"
"20.1 Major constituents533Another option is to cross-reference the experiencer on the verb—then the experiencer has
to be overtly stated, as in 20.66. The experiencer is highly topical: the hawk is stressing the
diﬃculty he has in entering the house without a key:
20.66 [wiya:r
wula-wula:k] [suan
yi-na-d@wun-@k]
house+lk+all enter-red+dat diﬃcult go-act.foc-1masc.sgbas.vt-conf
‘It is diﬃcult for me to enter the house’ (lit. I am diﬃcult to enter the house)
Such a topical experiencer has yet another crucial subject property: it controls switchreference. In 20.67, the same person experienced diﬃculties in talking and got into the hands
of an evil man:
20.67 [wun yi-y@

‘As it was diﬃcult for me to talk (lit. as I was diﬃcult to talk), I got into the hands of a
bad man’
Neither body part constructions, nor copula clauses or impersonal constructions, can form
imperatives or reﬂexives, or be used in constructions with modal verbs—which means that
these universal criteria for subjecthood are not applicable here.
Bodily and mental processes in Papuan languages are very often expressed with ‘impersonal’
constructions, which are problematic with respect to their subjecthood. The title of Pawley, Gi,
Majnep, and Kias’s (2000) ‘Hunger acts on me . . . ’ speaks for itself: the problems we have
just addressed for Manambu are pervasive in the whole area—also see Pawley (forthcoming),
Roberts (2001), and Priestley (2002). Compared to other Papuan languages, body part and
impersonal constructions in Manambu are fairly limited. And the experiencer is never marked
as an object. There is also a strong correlation between the topicality of an experiencer and its
potential subjecthood.
We conclude that in all such constructions in Manambu the topical participant has the
formal properties of a subject. This is congruent with the idea that subjects tend to be
grammaticalized topics (see, for instance, Keenan 1987: 103–4; and discussion in Dixon 1994:
11–30). It is interesting to note that subjecthood and topicality are closely intertwined just
in this instance, so much so that one is tempted to say that subjecthood in body part and
impersonal constructions is determined entirely by pragmatics.
Verbless clauses are also potentially problematic in terms of how their subjects are to
be identiﬁed. Clauses with non-verbal predicates other than adverbial and reactivated topic
demonstratives are pretty straightforward in this respect: we recall, from §20.1.3 above, that
their subject is cross-referenced on the predicate itself with cross-referencing enclitics. When
used in dependent clauses, non-verbal predicates have to be used with a support verb which
then also cross-references the subject constituent.
But verbless clauses and clauses with adverbial and reactivated topic demonstratives have no
subject cross-referencing. Neither can they be used in dependent clauses.
Since the predicate is marked with the suﬃx -n- in both clauses with adverbial and reactivated
topic demonstratives (see 20.52b), the other obligatory constituent can be safely identiﬁed
with the subject. This other constituent—e.g. ‘food’ in 20.52b—triggers gender and number
agreement on the demonstrative in the predicate slot, which makes it similar to a subject
(A/S). The order of constituents is ﬁxed: the predicate always comes last. We thus conclude
that the non-predicate noun phrase in non-verbal clauses with adverbial and reactivated topic53420 Clause Types and Discourse-Pragmatic Devicesdemonstratives as predicates is subject-like enough to be considered on a par with other
subjects.
The situation in verbless clauses is less clear. In clauses of the naming type, there is semantic
agreement between the ﬁrst and the second noun phrase. The order is ﬁxed; and the choice
of the second NP depends on the ﬁrst. And if a ‘naming’ verbless clause is rephrased as a
non-verbal clause, the ‘name’ is in the predicate slot and the person named is the subject. This
allows us to hypothesize that the ‘name’ occupies the predicate slot, and the person named is
the subject.
The same line of argument holds for verbless clauses with a reactivated topic demonstrative
in the second position—such as 20.52a. There is also some grammatical agreement between the
two constituents: so, in a verbless clause apawul ada (spirit dem.dist.react.top+masc.sg) ‘that
is a (masculine) spirit’ the masculine form is determined by the ﬁrst noun phrase. We can thus
suggest that the ﬁrst noun phrase is subject-like, and the second is not. Following the principles
of analogy with similar clauses, we can stipulate that the question word heads the predicate in
20.54, 10.98, 10.100–2. The situation with verbless clauses of other subtypes is just as murky:
the notion of subject does not appear to be applicable at all to the one-word clauses like those
in 20.53a and 20.55.
The category of a syntactic subject—A and S—is highly relevant for Manambu (despite its
limited applicability to verbless clauses). What about other grammatical relations?
B. The category of object (O). We saw in §7.3 that the direct object (O) is often marked with
accusative case. An O can also be cross-referenced on the verb in the second position—see
§3.1—and it can be referred to with a reactivated topic demonstrative (§3.3 and §10.2.3). The
O is added to an intransitive verb as a result of applying the morphological causative kay- (see
§16.2.1). But while accusative marking is just about exclusive to a direct object, the other two
properties are not. In particular, any non-subject constituent—with the exception of speech
reports and copula complements—can be cross-referenced on the verb in the second position,
provided it is topical. Then, an ‘object’ is just a part of a more general category which can
be negatively deﬁned as ‘non-subject’. This ‘non-subject’ shares a number of properties with
S—the subject of an intransitive verb: see below.
C. Linking together S, O, and ‘non-subjects’. All or most languages of the world display a
number of links between S (= subject of an intransitive verb) and O (= object of a transitive
verb) (see Dixon 1994: 55; and Aikhenvald and Dixon forthcoming). These links have nothing
whatever to do with ergativity of any kind. They are expected to be found in languages
with every pattern of syntactic and morphological alignment—that is, nominative/accusative,
absolutive/ergative, and so on. So, if a language marks quantiﬁcation on verbs, it is highly likely
that the number expressed will be that of S or O. And this is indeed the case with the marker of
complete involvement -tu- (see §12.4), e.g. kiya-tu-di (die-many-3plbas.p) ‘TheyS all died’ and
vya-tu-di (kill-many-3plbas.p) ‘They killed (all) of themo (all over the place)’; and not ∗ They
(all) killed them’ (see 12.22–4 and 12.72).
Besides this expected correlation between S and O, Manambu has a number of less obvious
ones. We saw in §3.3 and then in §10.2.3 that reactivated topic demonstratives can only refer to
an S, or an O, or, somewhat more rarely, to another non-subject participant—for instance,
recipient, location, and time. (That a demonstrative should operate on an absolutive basis
is hardly surprising—in Dyirbal and a few other languages, an NP including a nominal
demonstrative may only occur in S or O function which is the pivot function in Dyirbal: Dixon
2003: 83, 94–9.) These non-subject participants are the ones cross-referenced on the second
position—provided they are topical.","[559, 560, 561]"

In 10.54, a cross-referenced constituent referred to with a reactivated topic demonstrative is
someone with respect to whom the action is performed. Examples of this sort indicate that the
reactivated topic demonstratives operate predominantly, but not exclusively, on an S/O basis.
Alternatively, they can be described as operating on a non-A basis. As illustrated in 10.68, a
clause can contain two occurrences of reactivated topic demonstratives, but never more than
that.
The reactivated topic demonstratives do not appear to form one NP with the noun they refer
to. They agree with this noun in gender and number, but can never take any cases or suﬃxes
or be arguments of postpositions. There can be an intonation break between a demonstrative
and an NP it refers to (as in 10.68)—something atypical for an NP. Within a clause, they tend
to occur immediately preceding the verb (or the complex adverb+verb, as in 10.68). If the
constituent they refer to has a contrastive overtone, they follow it, as in 10.62. We will see,
in §20.1.1, that Manambu is not averse to split NPs; however, they are never split between
clauses.
In terms of spatial reference, the demonstrative stems employed in reactivated topic demonstratives have similar overtones to the nominal spatio-temporal demonstratives (§10.2.1, under
A). In 10.69, the ‘close to addressee’ demonstrative is used to refer to the names of men’s houses
which were enumerated for my (addressee’s) beneﬁt (just as in 10.25 above).

The last occurrence of aka (dem.dist.react.top+fem.sg) in aka kus@-na combines reference
to the O (‘story’) and to the action of telling itself: it supplies an aspectual overtone of ‘here
and now; ongoing action’ to a verb marked with action focus. Similar examples are under 10.56
and 10.78. We return to this in §12.1 and in §12.8.3 (C).
When reactivated topic demonstratives appear as predicate heads, they take the predicative marker -n followed by -a- and by gender-number agreement marker -@ka, e.g. k@ka-naka (dem.prox.react.top.fem.sg-pred-react.top.fem.sg) ‘this feminine singular (reactivated
topic) is’, often used as a summary statement, ‘this is how it is, this is how things are’. Its
distal demonstrative counterpart is often used in a similar way, meaning ‘so, this is how
it is’:22210 Closed Classes10.70 aw [k@-l-@m

In 10.71 (the end of Sepaywus’s recital of the names of men’s houses in Avatip), a plural
reactivated topic demonstrative heads the predicate. The gender and number agreement with
the subject is thus marked twice.

To conclude: reactivated topic demonstratives agree with a cross-linguistic tendency for
preferred argument structure whereby a topical element is never introduced in the A function. They are typologically quite unusual in that they combine reference to the constituent’s
topicality, its grammatical relation, and its position in space. The latter makes them somewhat
redundant, given that they often occur in the same clause as nominal demonstratives with the
same spatial reference.10.3 i ndefinites
Manambu has two indeﬁnites, with the meaning ‘other, another’. The agreeing modiﬁer fem.sg.
n@k@, masc.sg. n@k@-d@, dual n@k@-b@r , plural n@k@-di ‘another, other’ (see §5.1.1) refers to
another, additional and diﬀerent, participant, e.g. n@k@ ñ@ (another+fem.sg day) ‘next day,
another day’ and in 10.53 (’another story’). It can refer to ‘one’ and ‘another’ (members of a
pair), as in 10.55, or to several choices, as in 10.52. This example contains six occurrences of
n@k@ corresponding to the number of smoking grids in the spirit’s house. This pronoun can
also refer to an indeterminate location or time, or referent: n@k@ ñ@ (another+fem.sg day) can
mean ‘next day, another day’ (then its synonym is kwap@k ‘next day’). Or it can mean ‘some
other day, whenever’. This same pronoun may refer to additional objects, e.g. ‘two more plates’
as in 10.72.
10.72 n@k@-b@r plet viti akray!
other-du plate two impv+bring
‘Bring two more plates!’ (lit. two other plates)
The pronoun ‘other, another’ carries with it a distinct overtone of something undesirable
and potentially dangerous. In 10.3 above, ‘another man’, or a ‘stranger’ is a trespasser. A
similar example is 8.12 (the gist of it is that other people’s cats are strangers and do nothing
but damage).
The feminine locative form of the indefinite n@k@- ‘other, another’, n@k@m, means ‘halfheartedly; not fully’:10.3 Indeﬁnites22310.73 gura:m

This form can be repeated as n@k@m n@k@m (another.fem.sg+loc another.fem.sg+loc) ‘bit of
everything; in a random way’. In 10.74 it is used as modiﬁer to the noun, and in 10.75 as a
manner modiﬁer to the verb. In 21.44, repetition of n@k@m means ‘wherever’.

The pronoun n@k@- is usually employed as a prehead modiﬁer; only occasionally can its
head be omitted. In contrast, the indeﬁnite n@w@k ‘(an)other one’ is used only as a head. It can
be modiﬁed with nominal demonstratives, but, unlike any other nominal, does not take case
marking. It can have a singular referent, as in 10.76. It is in O function, but is not marked for
case.

n@w@k refers to ‘others among us’: the personal reference is obvious from the marking on the
verb.

n@k@- and n@w@k. The meaning of ‘someone; one . . . another’ can be achieved by using the
numeral ‘one’ (see §10.6). Repetition of a noun has a distributive indeﬁnite meaning, e.g. ag@k
‘one of the two sides’, ag@k ag@k ‘one side to the other’, tab@k ‘end of, side’, tab@k t@b@k ‘one
side and another’.10.4 i n t e r ro gat i v e s
Content questions are marked with a question word and slightly rising intonation, while
polar questions are marked by intonation only. Interrogative clauses are discussed in §20.1.3.
A question word does not have a ﬁxed position in a clause; like any constituent, if it is in
contrastive focus it tends to occupy the clause-initial position and acquire focus marking.
Interrogatives form a heterogeneous class in terms of their meanings, syntactic function,
focus marking, and grammatical categories. Interrogatives include nouns, adjectives, adverbs,
and quantiﬁers. There are no interrogative verbs. Manambu employs the following interrogative stems:
(i) s@- ‘who; whose’;
(ii) agwa- ‘what, which’;
(iii) ak@- ‘where; belonging to where; when’;
(iv) akr@l ‘where to’;
(v) agula ‘what’s up; what for; why’;
(vi) ata, ata ata, at@ta, atawa, at@tawa, at@taka, k@t@taka ‘how’; and
(vii) kas ‘how many/much; which (by number)’.
(i) The pronoun s@ ‘who’ has human reference, and can be used as an argument, as head of
predicate, and as a possessive modiﬁer (‘whose’). It takes all cases, except for transportatives
and substitutive. Unlike nouns, it cannot take any modiﬁer. As shown in §7.1, this form behaves
similarly to third person non-plural personal pronouns in that it takes a linker -k@-, as shown
in 10.79 (see §7.9 on the form of the comitative with ‘who’).

Unlike a personal pronoun, it cannot be reduplicated. A constituent in a medial completive
clause can be questioned, as in 10.80 and 9.33. This is one of the properties of these clauses
which diﬀerentiates them from other types, especially relative and conditional clauses (see
Chapter 19). The interrogative ‘who’ in 10.80 is in dative case, required by the verb ‘ask’ (lit.
‘ﬁrst plant’):

When used as a possessive modiﬁer, s@ takes the oblique marker -k@- and agrees in gender
and number with the possessee, as in 10.81.","[247, 248, 249, 250, 251]"

‘Just like that, silent, after she was carrying just her son on her breast . . . ’
The form taba-d@ka (hand+lk-only) ‘hands only, carrying nothing’ can be used in any
function, including a manner modiﬁer, or even as an elliptical greeting, in the meaning of ‘give
me your hand to shake, let’s shake hands’ (a more conventional way of saying the same thing
is ta:b kuru (hand get+1sgimpv) ‘may I take (your) hand’—see §13.2). Only occasionally can
this suﬃx appear on a case-marked noun, as in gan@r-d@ka (night+lk+instr-only) ‘only/just
by night’.
The suﬃx -d@ka can occur on the ﬁrst of a sequence of nouns repeated for expressive
purposes (§9.3), e.g. gan@-d@ka ga:n (night+lk-only night) ‘only night after night (and never in
daytime)’. This suﬃx occurs on the indicative positive form of the verb root, with the meaning
of ‘do just this’, e.g. waji-d@ka (laugh-only) ‘(he is) just laughing’ (§12.8.1).
It can also occur on a nominal component of a complex verb, especially if its verbal component is clear from the context, e.g. sa:-d@ka (sleep+lk-only) ‘(we will) only (do) sleeping’.
2. The suﬃx -r@ b ‘fully, totally’ occurs on uninﬂected forms of nouns and verbs and is not
compatible with any other inﬂections. A noun marked with -r@ b can occur in any function
except A. In 9.27, it occurs on a noun in an oblique function; in 9.28 it appears on a pronoun
(‘right there’).
9.27 ñ@d-@-ñ@d-@-r@b
adi:d
middle-lk-middle-lk-fully go.down.impv
‘Go down right in the middle (of a ladder)’
The suﬃx -r@ b is used in lieu of a superlative, e.g. kwasa-r@ b in 9.28. An elder sister is
teaching her younger sister how to shoot birds, and she is telling her to hit the really small
one.

‘(Can I hit it, said (the younger sister), no! (said the elder sister), that is a big one), you
hit this the smallest one (or: a really small one), right there’
Along similar lines, n@ma kudi-r@ b (big+fem.sg language/voice-fully) means ‘in a really loud
voice’. A headless adjective n@ma-r@ b (big+fem.sg-fully) ‘really big one’ was used to refer to
a very big teacup.
This same suﬃx is also used to express full identity with another entity. Yuamali’s reaction
to a list of cognates between Manambu and Gala was ñan-a kudi-r@b (we-lk language-fully)
‘(this is) our language fully!’ Similarly, Kulanawi said to me that his son’s name was Michael,
and added 9.29. A similar example is in 9.31.
9.29 ñ@n-a-d@
ñan sa:-r@b
you.fem-lk-masc.sg child name+lk-fully
‘It is exactly like your son’s name’
Just like -d@ka, -r@b attaches only to the indicative positive stem of a verb (see §12.8.1).
With personal pronouns, -r@ b may be used somewhat idiomatically to refer to a person’s
wishes. This is the only instance where a form with -r@ b takes nominal cross-referencing in a1909 Derivation and Compoundingnon-verbal clause, as in ñ@n-a-r@b-a (you.fem-lk-fully-3fem.sgnom) ‘it is up to you (lit. it is
fully you)’.
3. The suﬃxes -aba:b, -a:b ‘also’ are used with members of any word class, and can attach to
an inﬂected noun or a verb. There are no restrictions on the syntactic function of a noun. In
9.30, -aba:b goes onto the inﬂected verb in the form of predicate focus. That is, -aba:b can have
a whole clause in its scope:
9.30 kar-da-k@-m@na:l-aba:b
carry-down-fut-2masc.sgsubj.vt+3fem.sgbas.vt+3fem.sgnom-too
‘It is the case that you took her down, too’
Within a clause, -aba:b and -a:b more often attach to a constituent than to the inﬂected verb.
The diﬀerence between the two suﬃxes is subtle: -a:b is preferred when numerous additional
possibilities are enumerated, that is, when there is more than one additional participant in the
clause. In contrast, -aba:b tends to be used when there is just one additional participant. In
9.31 -a:b (underlined) occurs with enumerated body parts, and -aba:b (bold and underlined)
adds one extra body part (line 3) or participant (line 5):

beak, both (for) boy and (for) girl; their beards too are fully like chicken’s beards. She,
too, got the head like (that) of a chicken.’
This example also shows that the linker -k@- can occasionally be omitted (as in l@-aba:b in
the third line). These are the only suﬃxes with long vowels. Given that they do not trigger vowel
shortening in nouns with a long vowel as would be expected for suﬃxes, such as ta:m ‘nose’,
it is possible that these are better treated as clitics (note that they do not acquire secondary
stress).
The suﬃx -aba:b ‘also’ is probably etymologically related to the quantiﬁer aba:b ‘all’ (see
4.63 and §10.5).
4. The suﬃx -p@k has somewhat diﬀerent meanings depending on the class of word it attaches
to. As shown in Table 4.2 (§4.3.2), it means ‘like’ when used with verbs, ‘more or less; like’ when
used with nouns and other nominals, and is a comparative marker when used with adjectives.
The standard of comparison is not stated; a comparison is implied, as in 4.51 and 9.32

When used with nouns and pronouns, -p@k means ‘more or less, like’, as in 9.33. This was
a question to the oldest living Manambu man, Duamakwa:y, to determine how old he was at
the time of Behrmann’s expedition (see §1.4.2):

‘At the time when you knew Dangwan, who were you like (in terms of size and age) when
you knew him?’ (lit. having been like who you knew him?)
One grammatical word can contain only one suﬃx of the four suﬃxes contrasted in Table 9.2;
but in a noun phrase, one suﬃx can go onto its head and another one can attach to its end, as
in 9.34. The suﬃx -p@k typically attaches to the end of an NP, or a clause, as we will see below.

sky-lk-only language/voice-like say-hab-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt
‘It (earthquake) sounds just like the language/voice of thunder’
With the connective atan ‘then’, -p@k means ‘like this, this is how’ (§10.2.2). With a numeral,
-p@k means ‘more or less, approximately’, as in 9.35:
vitiya-p@k
9.35 akwur
l@-k@-k
impv+get she-obl-dat two+lk-approx
‘Give her two (Malay apples) or so’
A noun or a pronoun accompanied by -p@k can occur in the predicate slot and take personal
cross-referencing, as in 9.36.
9.36 wun aw m@n-a-p@k-awun-@k
I
then you.masc-lk-like-1fem.sgbas.vt-conf
‘Then I am like you’
A noun with the suﬃx -p@k can take further case suﬃxes, e.g. Malu-p@ka:r yi-di (Malulike+lk+all go-3plbas.vt) ‘they went a distance like (the one) from here to the Malu village’.
When used with a verb, the suﬃx -p@k implies comparison of activity. It then has a whole
clause in its scope—see 14.117, §19.3, and examples there. The suﬃx -p@k does not qualify
as a case marker: it can occur with cases and also, unlike any case-marked forms, a form
marked with -p@k can head a predicate. Unlike other derivational suﬃxes described here, it
is polyfunctional, being used as a derivational suﬃx ‘like’, as a means of clause combining,
and as a comparative marker on adjectives.
Further non-word class-changing derivations include reduplication of nouns. Full reduplication of nouns has distributive meaning (also see §4.3, and Table 4.2), as in ña-ñ@ (day+lk-day)
‘every day, day in day out’, bap-a-bap (moon-lk-moon) ‘month after month’, t@p-a-t@p ‘every
village’, gwalugw@ gwalugw@ ma:j (clan+lk clan+lk story) ‘story which goes from one clan to
another’, tamiy-a-tamiy (area-lk-area) ‘every area, every place’, wi(y)-a-wi (house-lk-house)1929 Derivation and Compounding‘every house’, and n@b-a-n@b ‘various strangers’. Such nouns can be used in any function, and
take case markers.
The reduplicated form of ga:n ‘night’ is irregular: ganap-ganap ‘every night’. The time noun
ganbab ‘early in the morning’ undergoes repetition rather than reduplication, in order to
acquire a distributive meaning, as in ganbab ganbab ‘every early morning’. The noun gra:b
is repeated in the locative case form: grab@m grab@m ‘every afternoon’. Time nouns denoting
relative time (tomorrow, yesterday, etc.) cannot be reduplicated.
The noun s@ ‘name’ has an irregular reduplication pattern: say-si ‘(call) each (person or
house) by name’. This pattern is reminiscent of that discussed in §12.8 (also see §16.1, on k@tayk@ti ‘look around and around’). In both k@tay k@tí and say-si, reduplication involves repeating
all the syllables of the form after its main occurrence, with the vowel of the last syllable lost
and y changed to i .
If a noun has a unique referent, it acquires an intensive meaning when reduplicated, as does
ñ@d ‘middle’ in ñ@d-@-ñ@d ‘the very middle’ (see 9.27 and 7.34). As shown in §4.3.2, reduplicated
adjectives also have intensive meaning, e.g. kwam ‘crazy’, kwam-a-kwam ‘very crazy’; yara
‘ﬁne’, yara-yara ‘very good’.
The reduplication of closed word classes produces intensive or distributive meaning, e.g.
adverbs m@ya-m@ya:b ‘really really; indeed’; s@ms@ma:b ‘well and truly (not) at all’ (s@ma:b
‘not at all’: see §14.6); k@p ‘just’, k@p-a-k@p-a ma:j (just-lk-just-lk talk) ‘words for nothing,
useless talk’. When the number ‘one’ is reduplicated, its meaning is idiosyncratic: nak-a-nak
(one-lk-one) ‘not many; each individually’ (also see §10.6.1; cf. Iatmul kita ‘that one’, kita kita
‘one each; each per unit’: Gerd Jendraschek, p.c.). The indeﬁnite determiner ka:p ‘on its own;
alone’ can be reduplicated in the intensive meaning ‘all alone’ (kap@-ka:p).
Inherently reduplicated roots are found in every word class except for verbs, e.g. ñauñau (t@)
‘smash’, l@kil@ki ‘soft’, n@mn@m ‘tired’, m@km@k, karkar ‘quietly’ (noun-like complements);
adverbs r @ka:r@k ‘properly’, apar apar ‘not properly’, mad@k mad@k ‘especially, namely’, and
r @ka:r@k ‘properly’; and quantiﬁers samasa:m ‘a lot’, and aba:b ‘all’.
Among one-oﬀ derivational formatives is the formative -b which derives the lexeme gan@b
‘morning’ from ga:n ‘night’, and -ab which derives the time noun ganba:b ‘early in the morning’
from gan@b ‘morning’. (This noun undergoes repetition rather than reduplication, to acquire a
distributive meaning, as in ganbab ganbab ‘every early morning’.) The formative -b may well be
cognate with the terminative case -Vb which is used as a derivational device on adverbs (§4.4).9.3 comp ounding
Manambu has a number of patterns of nominal compounding. Some noun phrases can be
realized as one or more than one phonological word depending on their syllable length. They
diﬀer from compounds in the number of grammatical words they form, and their semantic
compositionality. A compound always forms one grammatical word and tends to be semantically non-compositional. We saw in §2.5, that a modiﬁer-head noun phrase or a possessive
noun phrase (types A and C in §8.1.1) consisting of two or three syllables is pronounced as one
phonological word. Examples are: kula-má:j (new-word) ‘new word’, kwasa-ñán ‘small child’,
yala-wí (belly+lk-house) ‘the inside of a house’, m@w-mí ‘base of a tree’, taba-yí (hand+lk-ﬁre)
‘wrist watch’. They can be pronounced as two phonological words in slow deliberate register.
Similar structures are pronounced as several phonological words if more than three syllables
long.","[214, 215, 216, 217, 218, 219]"
"22610 Closed ClassesThe combination agwa ja:p is very frequent. In informal discourse, the noun ja:p ‘thing’ can
be used in the meaning of ‘what’, e.g. ja:p-al? (thing-3fem.sgnom) ‘what is it?’ as a synonym of
agwa ja:p-al? (what thing-3fem.sgnom) ‘what is it?’ The form agwa- can modify other nouns,
e.g. agwa kudi ‘what language?’, agwa ma:j ‘what talk/stories are there, what’s the gossip?’ It
can co-occur with adjectival modiﬁers, e.g. agwa kwasa-kwasa-di ma:j bla-dana-di? (what smallsmall-pl story talk-3plsubj.vt-3plbas.vt) ‘what little stories are they telling?’ In 10.86, agwa
modiﬁes a non-agreeing adjective ‘good’ used as head of predicate. Of all interrogatives, only
agwa can occur in exclamations, as exempliﬁed in 10.86.
10.86 agwa vyak@t-al
what good/beautiful-3fem.sgnom
‘What a beautiful (woman) it is!’
The form agwa- can be used as head only in non-core functions—that is, marked with
dative (agwa:k) meaning ‘why, what for’, as in 10.87, with locative (agwa:m) meaning ‘in what
location?’, with instrumental (agwar) meaning ‘with what; how’, and with comitative (agwawa)
meaning ‘with what’, as in 10.88.
Agwa:k is very similar in meaning to agwa jap@k (in 10.85); the diﬀerence is that the latter
presupposes a longer statement of reason or purpose, and may imply a material object as a
reason, while the former is more abstract and is often used in rhetorical questions:
atawa wa-ñ@na-d@wun-@k
10.87 a

‘Then why did you say thus to me?!’
10.88 agwawa
k@-k@r
what+com eat-des
‘What am I to eat (sago) with?’
Similarly to nominal demonstratives, agwa takes the accusative-locative case only in the
locative meaning. Unlike any other word class, the allative-instrumental case with agwa has
only instrumental meaning. Note that there is a special interrogative word with an allative
meaning, akr@l ‘where to’ (see (iv) ).
(iii) The pronoun ak@- ‘where, belonging to where’ is used as a modiﬁer to a noun whose
location is being questioned, and as predicate head. If it is used as a modiﬁer, the noun is
either the subject of a verbless clause, a temporal or a locative oblique, or the possessor.
The pronoun always takes gender and number agreement. Its feminine singular agreement
forms vary depending on whether it is used as head or as a modiﬁer. The masculine singular
agreement is, as expected, -d@, the dual is -b@r , and the plural is -di. This pronoun is only used
with third person reference.

(where.fem.sg time) is the only way of saying ‘when’, as in 10.89.
s@k@r ap
yi-b@r?
10.89 ak@
where.fem.sg time bone go/get-3dubas.vt
‘When did they two grow up’ (lit. ‘get bone’)
In 10.90, the masculine singular interrogative ak@-d@ is used to refer to a bamboo, in an
elliptical sentence. The bamboo is masculine because it is long:
10.90 wun asa:y a-d-a-wur
kañ@k
wa-na-d
I
father dem.dist-masc.sg-lk-up bamboo+lk+dat say-act.foc-3masc.sgbas.vt
ka:ñ?
ak@-d@
where-masc.sg bamboo
‘My father told me about that bamboo up (i.e. told me to fetch it). Bamboo which is
where?’
In 10.91, this interrogative refers to a possessor (here, a locality). This is the preferred way
of asking where a person is from:
tami-k@-l
ta:kw-a?
10.91 ak@
where.fem.sg area-poss-fem.sg woman-3fem.sgnom
‘What (lit. where) area’s woman (is she)?’
The form ak@- can take one transportative case, -say, as in 7.64. If the question focuses on
the location, and not on the participant in a location, the locative or the terminative case form
is used, as in 10.92:
kur-ñ@na-di
10.92 a-di
kway ak@m
dem.dist-pl shrimp where+loc get-2fem.sgsubj.vt-3plbas.vt
‘Where did you get those shrimp?’
Either terminative or locative case can be used in asking about the source, as in 7.29, 7.55,
and 10.93:
t@-l@-k]
10.93 oh, vyak@t-a ta:kw, [ak@m
oh good-lk woman where+loc be/stand-3fem.sg-compl.ds
karya-m@na
bring-2masc.sgsubj.vt+3fem.sgbas.vt
‘Oh, (what) a beautiful woman, where did you bring her from?’ (lit. ‘while she was staying
where, did you bring her from?’)
When focused, ak@- behaves similarly to reactivated topic demonstratives used as predicate
heads: the ak@- form takes a linking marker followed by -aka (glossed here as focus marker).
Unlike reactivated topic demonstratives, the marker is -m- (not n) for all forms, except ak@m
(where+loc) which does not take any marker (cf. -n- in aka-n-aka in 10.70). Focused forms
of interrogatives—unlike those for reactivated topic demonstratives—are not used as predicate
heads. Forms marked with the transportative -say and with the terminative -Vb do not occur
in the focus position at all.
As is always the case with focused constituents, focused locative interrogatives appear clauseinitially. In 10.94, a masculine singular form of ak@- is a modiﬁer in contrastive focus. As is
typical for a focused element, it is in the clause-initial position. The implication of the rhetorical
question in 10.94 is that there is no territory belonging to the cassowary’s son.","[252, 253, 254]"

Introduction: The Language and its Speakers
Manambu belongs to the Ndu language family, and is spoken by about 2,500 people in
ﬁve villages: Avatip, Yawabak, Malu, Apa:n, and Yambon (Yuanab) in East Sepik Province,
Ambunti district. About 200–400 speakers live in the cities of Port Moresby, Wewak, Lae, and
Madang; a few people live in Kokopo and Mount Hagen.1.1 l i n g u i s t i c ty p e
Manambu is synthetic, with elements of fusion, and predominantly suﬃxing. The imperative
marker a- is the only fully productive preﬁx (§13.2.1), while the causative-manipulative preﬁx
kay- occurs with a limited number of verbs (§16.2.1). The inﬁx -ka- marks intensive forms of
non-agreeing adjectives (§4.3).
Manambu has twenty consonants and nine vowels. There is a series of simple voiced and
voiceless bilabial, apico-dental, and dorso-velar stops (just like in other Ndu languages). Voiced
and voiceless bilabial and dorso-velar stops also have a labialized counterpart. All the voiced
stops and the voiced fricative j are prenasalized in word-initial, intervocalic, and word-ﬁnal
positions. Vowel length is contrastive. Long vowels a: and æ: are a recent innovation: older
speakers still pronounce these as sequences of identical short vowels interrupted by a glottal
stop. Syllable structure is (C)(C)V(C). Stress is movable and contrastive. Long vowels tend to
be stressed (Chapter 2).
Open classes are nouns and verbs. Nominal categories include case, three numbers, and two
genders in the singular. Grammatical relations are expressed with verbal cross-referencing and
with nominal case marking. Manambu has nine case forms, more than any other Ndu language. The subject case is formally unmarked. The same form marks locative and a deﬁnite and
fully involved object. Another form expresses direction and instrument. The dative case marks
beneﬁciary and maleﬁciary, and also has an aversive meaning, ‘for fear of’. The terminative
case means ‘on the very edge of’, and ‘up until’. Two cases mark ‘means of transportation’.
The substitutive case means ‘instead of’. The comitative case meaning ‘together with’ is
a major device for coordinating noun phrases. Its additional meanings are locative ‘along
(e.g. a road)’ and temporal ‘while’. Case markers may attach to verbal roots: the objectivelocative case marks completive aspect, dative case marks purpose, instrumental case derives
deverbal adverbs, and substitutive case marks dependent clauses meaning ‘instead of doing
something’.
Verbal categories include personal cross-referencing fused with tense, aspect, mood
(imperative-permissive, and irrealis), and modalities (optative, purposive, desiderative, and two
frustratives). The subject (A/S) is always cross-referenced on the verb. A second argument—
direct object, beneﬁciary, location, time, manner, or instrument—can be cross-referenced if
it is more topical than the subject. A copula complement, a speech report, and a comitative constituent are never cross-referenced. Members of word classes other than verbs take21 Introductioncross-referencing enclitics when they occupy the predicate slot (Chapters 3–4). This is unlike
most other Ndu languages which cross-reference only the subject.
A small closed class of agreeing adjectives has three members, ‘big’, ‘small’, and ‘ﬁne’; these
agree in gender and number with the head noun. About sixteen non-agreeing adjectives—
which cover semantic types such as value, dimension, colour, and age—share a number of
properties with nouns. Adverbs and time words are semi-closed classes which share a few
properties with nouns. Word class-changing derivations are limited.
A striking property of Manambu is its gender system. Two genders, masculine and feminine,
are assigned to nouns according to their referents’ sex and also shape and size. That is, a
large house is masculine, and a small house feminine. Genders are covert in the sense that,
rather than being marked on the noun itself, they appear on the agreeing modiﬁers, verbs,
and adverbial demonstratives, and in possessive constructions. The feminine gender is both
formally and functionally unmarked (Chapter 5).
Three numbers—singular, dual, and plural—are marked on the agreeing modiﬁers, verbs,
and in possessive constructions. Plural and dual are marked on most kinship terms and on
a few nouns with a human referent. Associative non-singular (X and his/her associates) is
restricted to just personal names (Chapter 6). The choice between ﬁve types of possessive
construction depends on the type of possessive relationship, of possessee, and of possessor
(Chapter 8).
The system of demonstratives is unusually intricate. Three demonstrative roots, k@‘proximate demonstrative: near speaker’, wa- ‘proximate demonstrative: near addressee’, and
a- ‘distal demonstrative’, are used in nominal demonstratives, in manner adverbial demonstratives, and in reactivated topic demonstratives. Nominal demonstratives express either spatiotemporal deixis or ‘current relevance’. The latter are derived from the former with the suﬃx
-na- ‘current relevance’, indicating that the object of pointing is being talked about, or is of
immediate or ongoing importance to the speakers. Spatio-temporal demonstratives distinguish
gender and number, and may also distinguish either three additional degrees of distance, or
ﬁve directions. ‘Current relevance’ demonstratives distinguish ﬁve directions, and two additional degrees of distance, but no number or gender. Reactivated topic demonstratives refer
predominantly to an S/O constituent (Chapter 10).
Negation is marked diﬀerently depending on aspect, tense, mood, and modality. Nonhabitual negative indicative clauses have no person marking. All dependent clauses are negated
diﬀerently from main clauses. Three prohibitives diﬀer in their illocutionary force.
Manambu has a productive system of verbal compounds (they can be alternatively analysed
as one-word serial verbs: Chapter 15). They express manner, aspectual and sequential meanings, and function as valency-changing devices. Many are lexicalized and have idiomatic
meanings.
Verbs divide into several subclasses depending on whether they can occur with directional
markers, and which directional markers they occur with. Inherently directional verbs
include the six basic verbs war- ‘go upwards’, da- ‘go downwards’, væki- ‘go across (away from
the speaker)’, væra- ‘go across (towards speaker)’, wula- ‘enter, come in, come in a direction
from the Sepik River’, and waku- ‘go out (including motion in direction away from the Sepik
River)’. These do not take any further directional speciﬁcations. Their roots are the base
for directional markers on other verbs, and on demonstratives. Intrinsically directional
verbs include four roots which must take directional suﬃxes, each of which corresponds
to an inherently directional verb. The majority of verbs are optionally directional. They
combine with bound forms consisting of s@- followed by a directional marker. Copula verbs,1.1 Linguistic type3the general motion verbs yi- ‘go’ and ya- ‘come’, and ingestive and stative verbs do not combine
with any directionals. Directionals also have a valency-increasing eﬀect. Directionals on verbs
and on demonstratives have similar origins, but display subtle diﬀerences in their semantics
(Chapter 16).
Manambu has a semi-productive causative-manipulative preﬁx kay- which causativizes a
limited set of intransitive verbs. When applied to transitive verbs, it indicates a special physical
eﬀort and the intensity of action. There is no passive. Instead, Manambu employs transitivityneutralizing constructions which involve clause chaining, and are ambiguous as to their status
as biclausal or as monoclausal. A reciprocal marker awarwa has an associative meaning
‘together with’. Reﬂexive meanings are expressed with a variety of means none of which
involves a verbal derivation (§16.2).
Ten polyfunctional verbs can each be used as an auxiliary or as a support verb, and also
as a copula verb (Table 4.1, and Chapter 17). Auxiliary verb constructions express aspectual,
positional, and modal meanings. There are also a variety of idiomatic complex predicates. Body
part constructions—expressing emotional, mental, and physical states—are a special subtype
thereof.
Clause linking in Manambu is achieved through a variety of means. The major strategy is
clause chaining via medial dependent clauses. In most cases this involves switch-reference (that
is, marking of dependent clauses may be sensitive to whether their subject (A/S) is the same as
that of the following clause or not). The tense and extent of action expressed in a medial clause
is determined by its relationship to the action of a subsequent dependent clause or a main
clause. There are also causal clauses, and ‘unlikely condition’ clauses. Other clause-linking
devices include juxtaposition of a dependent clause and a main clause (this is a preferred
manner of indicating conditional meanings); clause linking via a case marker ‘instead’ and
a suﬃx ‘like’, and clause linking involving connectives.
Relative clauses are similar to main clauses in most properties; they are negated like dependent clauses. Speech reports—direct, indirect, and ‘semi-direct’—are highly frequent. They
express a wide variety of meanings, including desire, fear, and reason. Manambu has no
complement clauses as a special clause type; instead, medial and other dependent clauses are
co-opted as complementation strategies (Chapters 18 and 19).
Constituent order in Manambu tends to be verb ﬁnal. It is often motivated by discourse
pragmatics. Word order within constituents depends on their type. For instance, quantiﬁers
can precede the noun head or follow it depending on the referent’s topicality. Chapter 20
oﬀers a comprehensive analysis of the principles of ordering words and constituents, and also
of the structure of constituents, and of clauses. An argument, or the predicate, can occur
in a highlighting focus construction. A focused constituent appears marked as a non-verbal
predicate head with the appropriate person markers, and the rest of the clause remains as it
was. Highlighting focus constructions may appear biclausal. A focused noun phrase has the
makings of a full verbless clause, since it contains the non-verbal cross-referencing markers.
However, it is not a full clause because it cannot be negated separately. Highlighting focus
constructions are an instance of grammar-in-the-making, similar to transitivity-neutralizing
constructions involving clause chaining (§19.9 and §20.3).
Manambu has a highly elaborate verbal and nominal lexicon. Typologically unusual semantic groups of verbs cover eating, drinking, and chewing, perception, and speech. Highly speciﬁc
terms coexist with highly generalized ones. A general noun ma:gw ‘whatever, whatchamacallit’
and a general verb m@gi- ‘do whatever’ are an option, if one cannot think of the right term, or
prefers to be non-speciﬁc. In the Manambu tradition, knowledge—tantamount to monetary41 Introductionriches—is viewed in terms of lexicon, especially the totemic names (which are nouns). The
issue of name ownership acquires particular importance at name debates (saki). Multiple
‘names’—each belonging to a diﬀerent clan—result in multiple synonymy. The totemic names
are used as address terms, as an integral part of Manambu speech etiquette, where the traditional patterns coexist with newly acquired Western imports.
In terms of the etymological make-up of its lexicon and grammar, Manambu is a central
member of the Ndu family. There are a number of loans from other languages of the area,
mostly Western Iatmul. Similarities between Manambu and the neighbouring Kwoma are
contact induced. All the speakers of Manambu are proﬁcient in Tok Pisin and many also
in English, and code-switching is pervasive. Signs of incipient language obsolescence look
ominous—however, a strong opposition to language loss gives room to hope that the language
will live.1.2 t he manambu: t h e p r e s e n t a n d t h e pa s t
The Manambu occupy ﬁve villages in the Ambunti District in the East Sepik Province
of Papua New Guinea (see Map). They live mostly on the Sepik River (Manambu ñab,
cf. Kwoma nabagey 1 ), and more precisely, on its section between the Hunstein Mountain range
and the Washkuk Hills. Avatip is the major village in terms of population, of physical size, of
ceremonial signiﬁcance, and of military exploits. We return to this in §1.2.2 and §1.4.
The Manambu and the neighbouring Kwoma have been fortunate, in terms of attracting
high-quality anthropological research. Useful and highly informative accounts of the Manambu culture in Newton (1971), Bragge (1990), and especially Harrison (1983, 1985a–b, 1987,
1990a–b, 1993) contain anthropological analysis and innumerable insights into the cultural
and cognitive patterns of Manambu ritual and everyday life over the years. This is why this and
the following sections are limited to a very brief sketch of cultural background, with just the
information necessary for understanding the grammar which follows.","[25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31]"
"1647 Case MarkingOf all the cases in Manambu, the comitative is the most complex semantically. It can be used
to coordinate nouns within an NP, to mark two oblique functions (concomitant participant
and perlative locative), and one core function (copula complement), and has developed into a
derivational marker.7.10 s u m m a ry: how many cases d oes manambu have ?
Manambu has nine case forms (including zero). Each has a number of meanings and functions,
and is in opposition to others. There are two ways of interpreting this system. We can distinguish nine cases each corresponding to one form (this can be called a ‘lumper’ approach).
Or we can distinguish eighteen cases, going strictly by their function (this can be called a
‘splitter’ approach). Table 7.2 contrasts a ‘lumper’ and a ‘splitter’ approach, with a summary
justiﬁcation for either.
The coordinating comitative on NP level is used to link constituents of an NP and does not
mark any grammatical relations; this is why it is not treated on a par with other cases here.
The terminative, two transportative and substitutive cases are semantically and functionally
straightforward, and constitute one case each. (As shown in Table 3.5, a form marked with
these cases, except for terminative, cannot be cross-referenced on the verb.)
A ‘lumper’ approach has two advantages—it is economical and allows us to capture a
notable semantic and syntactic connection between diﬀerent case meanings and uses, which
include
(i) ø marking for copula complements and for the second argument of verbs ‘turn into’
(which may be viewed as a variety of copula verbs of ‘becoming’);
(ii) the -Vm ‘accusative-locative case’ which has a shared meaning of complete involvement
of the O argument, the locative, or another argument completely aﬀected by the action;
(iii) the -Vk ‘dative-aversive’ case where the common syntactic core is marking arguments
which are not prototypical or not completely aﬀected objects; and
(iv) the -wa ‘comitative case’ which has a variety of meanings all of which can be captured
under the umbrella notion of ‘accompaniment’.
A ‘splitter’ approach allows us to separate diﬀerent meanings and functions of the same
form. It is appropriate when two or more meanings of a form have little in common semantically or syntactically or both.
Putting together the advantages of both approaches, we judge it most reasonable and
economical to postulate the following system of thirteen cases:
ø-case for subjects;
ø-case for copula complements;
ø-case for objects;
ø-case for manner;
-Vm ‘complete involvement of an argument (most often locatives and O arguments)’;
-Vk ‘dative case for third arguments and not fully aﬀected second arguments; aversive and
purposive’;
-Vr ‘allative case’;
-Vr ‘instrumental case’;
-wa ‘comitative case’;Table 7.2 Polysemous cases in Manambu: two approachess

Genetic and Areal Relationships, and New
Developments in the Language
We will discuss genetically inherited and areally diﬀused features of the Manambu lexicon
and grammar, before addressing code-switching with Tok Pisin and English, and further new
developments in the language.22.1 manambu as a ndu la nguage
All languages of the Ndu family show uniformity in their pronominal paradigms (see Appendix 22.1), and in a large part of their nominal and verbal lexicon. All the Ndu languages
have cases for core and peripheral arguments. Verbal categories vary in their marking and
semantics.
The Ndu languages are predominantly suﬃxing, with few preﬁxes, such as the imperative a-,
and the causative-manipulative kay-, both attested in Manambu. They are strictly nominativeaccusative, with pronominal cross-referencing for A/S recently evolved out of pronouns. Only
Manambu and Gala cross-reference more than one argument. A reconstruction of Proto-Ndu
phonology and morphology is in Aikhenvald (forthcoming b).
In terms of grammatical complexity and richness of forms, Manambu and Gala (or Ngala)
exceed other Ndu languages. Gala is unusual in a number of further ways, such as the pronominal system (see below), pervasive preﬁxing, complex vowel system, and lack of prenasalization
of stops. When, on my visit to the Swakap village, I ﬁrst enquired after the name of the
language, I was told that it was /gala duŸ
p/, and not /∗N gala/—the latter was condemned as a
way the Manambu refer to this language. (We can recall, from §1.4.1, that the old enmities
between the Gala and the Manambu dating back to the Gala wars are still alive in people’s
memories: the Avatip people recall recent hostile attacks by the Gala.)
Distinguishing two genders, roughly deﬁned as ‘masculine’ and ‘feminine’, is a pervasive
feature of the Ndu languages. In terms of its semantics, gender assignment is sex based
for human referents. It is shape and size based for referents of other groups (see Chapter
5 above), at least in Manambu, Iatmul, and Gala. In the Yangoru dialect of Boiken, the
assignment is based on size and also hardness or softness of the referent (hard objects,
such as ironwood and hard-textured yam varieties, are assigned masculine gender and soft
objects, such as soft tuber varieties, are female: Paul Roscoe, p.c.). Gender marking is overt
in personal pronouns and in verbs, and covert in numerous other contexts (such as adjectival
agreement).
Gender marking is uniform across the Ndu family. Cognates of the Manambu masculine
singular -d (cf. masculine singular pronoun d@) are found in Iatmul d1 ‘he; 3masc.sg agreement
marker’, Hanga Kundi (West Wosera) dé ‘personal pronoun; subject agreement suﬃx’ (Wendel
1993: 59), Ambulas dé (Kundama, Wilson, and Sapai 1987) ‘he’, and Boiken (Yangoru) d@
(Freudenburg 1979).","[617, 618]"
"1607 Case MarkingThe comitative marker -wa attaches to the linker, just like any other case. The only anomaly
is the comitative formed on s@ ‘who’: the comitative is s@ka:wa ‘with whom?’ rather than ∗s@k@-wa, as would be expected following the analogy of d@ ‘he’, d@-k@-wa ‘with him’.
A. Coordinating comitative is the most common means of coordinating two nouns within
one NP. Three options are available here:
A1. Comitative marked once in an np is used to coordinate any two nouns whose referents are
closely linked together, e.g. as co-participants in a story, such as tapwuk-a-wa yayib (roosterlk-com rock.wallaby) ‘rooster and rock wallaby’, waj@-wa sakibag (eel+lk-com wild.taro) ‘eel
and wild taro’, ñanugw-@-wa ta:kw (children-lk-com woman) ‘women and children’, or Y@sana-wa Mayau (Yessan-lk-com Maio) ‘people from Yessan and from Maio’ (representatives of
one group live next door to each other and speak the same language). The expression s@r-a-wa
mu: (tomorrow-lk-com day.after.tomorrow) means not just ‘tomorrow and the day after’, but
can refer to ‘next few days’ as a whole. In contrast, a list of disparate entities does not require
a coordinator.
A coordinating comitative requires dual or plural agreement on the possessive, e.g. Wargaba-wa Wapanab d@ya-k@-di a:s (Wargab.clan-lk-com Wapanab.clan they-obl-pl dog) ‘dog
(names) belonging to the Wargab and the Wapanab clans (lit. Wapanab and Wargab their
names of dogs)’, and on the verb, as in 7.69. (Another example of agreement of coordinate
comitatives with demonstratives, ‘his (two) bow and arrow’, is in 7.71).
takwa-wa
l@-k@
ñan] ata kwa-b@r
7.69 [a
dem.dist+fem.sg woman+lk-com she-obl+fem.sg child then stay-3dubas.vt
‘The woman and her child then stayed (there)’
If more than two nouns are coordinated, there are two options: the second and the third nouns
can be juxtaposed to the comitative marked noun, as in 7.70.
7.70 [Kuimag-a-wa Sirunki Lai] ata ya-di
Kuimag-lk-com Sirunki Lai then come-3plbas.vt
‘Kuimag, Sirunki, and Lai came then’
Alternatively, the connective wa can be used, e.g. Elizabet-a-wa Paul wa br@-k@ ñan Sandra
(Elizabeth-lk-com Paul and 3du-obl+fem.sg child Sandra) ‘Elizabeth, Paul, and their daughter Sandra’. The latter option is dispreferred by older and more traditional speakers. In each
case, the plural agreement on the verb indicates that the coordinate NP is one constituent.
There are no restrictions on the function of an NP containing a coordinating comitative of
types A1 and A2. Example 7.71 is an example of an adnominal comitative on the ﬁrst word of
the two NPs, and the dative and the accusative-locative at the end of the respective NPs.

noun phrase); note that the case markers go onto diﬀerent words within an NP constituent.
Coordinate comitative NPs are pronounced as one intonation unit, without a pause. The word
order is ﬁxed, and the NP cannot be split.
A2. Comitative in comitative-marked argument elaboration constructions was discussed
in §6.2.3. The major diﬀerence between such constructions with and without comitative is the
equality of participation: the comitative-marked participant is somewhat backgrounded (see
6.37–9). For innovative speakers highly proﬁcient in Tok Pisin, the comitative postpositions
wuk@n ‘with, together’ (as in 4.69–70 and 7.72) and nakamib (as in 6.39) are synonymous with
the comitative.
A comitative-marked inclusory construction can be in any case function. The case marker
goes onto the cover pronoun, as shown in 7.72. This is in contrast to most other types of NP:
wun-a-wa Yuakalu wuk@n]
7.72 kus@-d@-k
aw [an-a:k
die-3masc.sg-compl.ds then we.two-lk+dat I-lk-com Yuakalu together
an-a:k
kap@-n t@-da-l
aka
we.two-lk+dat wait-seq stay-3plsubj.p-3fem.sgbas.p dem.dist.react.top.fem.sg
‘After he died, that time they waited for us two, me and Yuakalu’
The word order within the NP is ﬁxed, just as in A1 above.
A3. Double comitative occurs in an NP consisting of two nouns marked with the comitative referring to one participant or event which can be in any function in a clause. Saying
t@p-a-wa kapayawi-a-wa k@-k-na-wun (coconut-lk-com sweet.potato-lk-com eat-fut-act.foc1sgbas.vt) means ‘I will eat coconut and sweet potato together’ referring to eating them
simultaneously (with shaved coconut spread on the sweet potato). In 7.73, m@r @-wa 3 walawa (strong.wind+lk-com rain+lk-com) ‘hurricane; strong wind and heavy rain happening
simultaneously’ triggers singular agreement on the verb. That wa:l ‘rain’ is the head of the
construction is corroborated by the choice of the weather verb j @- ‘to rain’ (see §4.2.2) which
can only be used with ‘rain’, and not with any other phenomenon:
wala-wa]
ata ja:d
7.73 [m@r@-wa
strong.wind+lk-com rain+lk-com then fall.of.rain+3masc.sgbas.p
‘Then there was (lit. rained) a heavy rain with simultaneous wind’
If the two participants are animate, the agreement on the verb is non-singular, as in T3.52
(‘Oselo and the snake the two together died that night’). This is not an inclusory construction:
the double comitative is one NP, and the ‘two together’ is another. There is an intonation break
between the two NPs.
A double comitative construction can consist of any nouns, e.g. amæy-@-wa ñ@n@-wa
(mother-lk-com child+lk-com) ‘mother and child together’, and even of pronouns: when I
showed a picture of myself with Kulanawi, his reaction was: ñ@n-a-wa wun-a-wa! (you.fem-lkcom I-lk-com) ‘you and me together!’ A double comitative construction does not allow any
other case morphology on the same NP.
B. Comitative as associated participant is an oblique, meaning ‘together with’; it is never
cross-referenced on the verb. Unlike adnominal comitative, the marker of the comitative of
associated participant goes on the head of an NP. The comitative-marked NP can be placed
before the verb or after it depending on its topicality: in 7.74 it is postposed to the verb.

Closed Classes
Closed word classes are personal pronouns (§10.1), demonstratives (§10.2), indeﬁnites (§10.3),
interrogatives (§10.4), quantiﬁers (§10.5), and numerals (§10.6). Most of them share some properties with nouns but do not take the full range of noun morphology discussed in Chapters 4–9.
This justiﬁes their recognition as separate classes. An overview of their morphological and
syntactic features is in §10.7.10.1 p e r s o na l p ro n o u n s
Personal pronouns are given in Table 3.3 (repeated here). They distinguish three numbers—
singular, dual, and plural—and two genders in second and in third person singular. There is a
clear etymological connection between independent pronouns, the two sets of tense-sensitive
verbal cross-referencing markers, and cross-referencing enclitics employed with non-verbal
predicates (listed in Tables 3.1–2 and 3.4). Grammaticalization of personal pronouns as crossreferencing markers appears to be relatively recent.
Personal pronouns share most properties with nouns. Just like nouns, they take the approximative suﬃx -p@k in the meaning ‘like’, e.g. wun-a-p@k (I-lk-approx) ‘more or less like me’.
A pronoun can occur in apposition with a noun or a noun phrase, e.g. wun ñ@n-a ñam@s (I
you.fem-lk+fem.sg younger.sibling) ‘me, your younger sister’. However, it cannot be modiﬁed
by adjectives or relative clauses, or head a possessive NP (see type D2 in §8.1.1, for possessive
constructions employed with a pronominal possessor).
All non-singular personal pronouns participate in argument elaboration (‘inclusory’) constructions (see §6.2.3; examples 6.32–3) as cover terms. A direct object expressed with a
personal pronoun tends to be case marked, unless the grammatical relations are fully clear
from the context (as in 7.5, in §7.2).
Non-third person pronouns stand apart from third person pronouns in the following ways:
(i) First and second person pronouns always have an animate (preferably human) referent, as
a speech act participant. Third person pronouns may refer to any entity.
(ii) Third person non-plural pronouns take the oblique marker -k@- (see §4.1.1; this form is
homophonous with the possessive marker -k@- discussed in §8.2) to form cases expressed with
a non-ø suﬃx, e.g. d@-k@-k (he-obl-dat) ‘to him’, d@-k@-wa (he-obl-com) ‘with him’, and to
combine with each of four suﬃxes discussed in §9.2. The linker is also obligatory if a pronoun
is used as an argument of a postposition (see §4.5), e.g. d@-k@ kuk@r (he-obl after) ‘after him’.
(iii) Third person pronouns take all case markers, while ﬁrst and second person pronouns do
not occur with transportative cases.
(iv) First and second person pronouns occur in identiﬁcation constructions (see §8.2.2) whereby
the notional possessor is the subject of a verbless clause, and the possessed noun occupies the
predicate slot. Such constructions with personal pronouns imply full ownership and complete19810 Closed Classes

d@y, dayidentiﬁcation between the possessor and the possessed. An orator would enumerate the totemic
names belonging to their clan, and then summarize his speech by saying 8.24 or 10.1:
10.1 ñan-adiyan
we-1plnom
‘These are ours’ (lit. ‘(these) are us’)
(v) Only third person pronouns are used as pronominal possessive markers in possessive noun
phrases of type D2, used if possessor is a noun with a speciﬁc referent (§8.1.1).
(vi) Only a third person pronoun can be used as a modiﬁer in noun phrases which contain a
functionally unmarked distal demonstrative. The agreement in gender and number with the
head noun is obligatory. The meaning of these combinations is akin to that of a deﬁnite article
with emphatic overtones, ‘that very one’ (see §20.1.1 on NP structure). This is a way of referring
to a previously mentioned important participant. Example 10.2 comes from a story about a
man who encountered a woman in the jungle.
10.2 [la
ta:kw] vyak@t-a ta:kw ma:, kuprap-@ ta:kw-al
she+dem.dist.fem.sg woman good-lk woman neg bad-lk woman-3fem.sgnom
‘That previously mentioned woman is not a good woman, she is a bad woman (she is an
evil spirit)’
Three clauses later, the woman is mentioned again; she is an important participant—the one
who is going to bring misfortune to the man. A noun phrase which contains a personal
pronoun in an article-like function, a distal demonstrative, and an indeﬁnite pronoun is in
10.3:

du] ata ya:d
he dem.dist-masc.sg other-masc.sg man then go+3masc.sgbas bush+lk+all
‘That very one (previously mentioned important participant) other man then went to the
bush’
Such sequences of a personal pronoun and a demonstrative do not belong to two separate
NPs, because there is no pause between them, and the two are often pronounced as one
phonological word.
These six features point towards the existence of subtle grammatical distinctions between
ﬁrst and second person pronouns (that is, speech act participants) and third person pronouns
(non-speech act participants). We return to this distinction in §19.5.4, on speech report techniques.","[223, 224, 225]"
"5.2 Semantics and markedness1255.22 agwa ja:p-ad?
what thing-3masc.sgnom
‘What is it (this loud noise)?’
The non-agreeing adjective ‘old’ which distinguishes two gender forms in the singular does
not have a plural form. Then the feminine form apaw is used as a general form, as in 5.23.
5.23 numa
apaw-adi
ñ@g
big+fem.sg old:fem-3plnom mosquito.net
‘Mosquito nets are truly/largely old’
A group of referents of diﬀerent sex (for animates), shape, and size (for inanimates) requires
agreement with non-singular numbers, where gender is neutralized. Coordinate compounds
whose referent is inherently non-singular require non-singular agreement on modiﬁers. Just
occasionally, they can trigger singular agreement. Then, if the last noun has inherent gender, it
determines the agreement. In 5.24, the masculine agreement on the possessor is determined by
the inherent gender of asa:y ‘father’.
5.24 ñ@n-a-d@
amæy asa:y v@vak
2fem.sg-lk-masc.sg mother father see+red+dat
‘(You) want to see your parents (lit. mother-father)’
B. The feminine agreement form is used with a number of non-prototypical controllers, including action and object nominalizations in the predicate slot: see 4.7–8. A purposive form as a
complementation strategy (in the function of the subject of a verbless clause: 5.25) and a copula
complement (5.26) requires feminine agreement.
numa
ja:p-a
5.25 t@p-a:r

suan
yi-na
village-lk+all go+red+dat diﬃcult go-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt
‘To go to the village is hard’
And we saw, in 4.65–6, that in modal constructions with n@b@ ‘be able’ (§4.5.1) the verb is
in the third person feminine form, no matter what gender and number the S or A is. A similar
example is 5.27.
5.27 n@b@ ya:n
suku-l
able come+seq write-3fem.sgbas.p
‘One can carry on writing’ (referring to the two of us writing together)
The feminine agreement form is used with loans with abstract meaning, e.g. numa apaw
tenkyu (big+fem.sg old+fem.sg thankyou) ‘thank you very much, a very big thankyou’ (lit. big
old thankyou).
C. The feminine form is the one consistently used in highlighting focus constructions—as
shown in 5.28 (see further discussion in §20.3):
yi-ba-l-a
5.28 Swakap-a:r
Swakap-lk+all go-1plsubj.p-3fem.sgbas.p-3fem.sgnom
‘It is (the case) that we went to Swakap’1265 Gender Marking, Semantics, and AgreementGeneric statements—often used for phatic communication—always require feminine agreement, as in 5.29 which is almost like a ﬁxed expression.
5.29 aka-n
aka
dem.dist.react.top+fem.sg-pred dem.dist.react.top+fem.sg
‘Here it is, this is how things are’
Example 5.30 illustrates a summarizing phrase which can be roughly translated as ‘this is how
things are, this is it’. The distal demonstrative a is in a highlighting focus construction (this
pronoun is typically used for textual deixis: §10.2).
5.30 al-al
dem.dist.fem.sg+3fem.sgnom-3fem.sgnom
‘This is how it is’ (lit. it is that, that is that)
The same principle applies to adjective forms. The feminine agreement form of the adjective
‘old’, apaw, is used in generic statements: 5.31 is a general comment about old people who had
lived all their adult lives outside the village:
5.31 apaw
apaw
t@-ku
t@p-a:r
yiya:k
vyak@t ma:
old.fem old.fem become-compl.ss village-lk+all go+red+dat good neg
‘Having become very old, it is not good to go to the village’
D. The feminine, rather than the masculine, form of agreeing adjectives and agreeing closed
classes is used as a default form in a number of grammatical contexts where the gender
agreement is not required.
The feminine form of agreeing adjectives is used when agreeing size adjectives appear in
adverbial functions, e.g. kwasa (small+fem.sg) ‘a little; almost’, numa (big+fem.sg) ‘in a big
way’ (also see 4.52 and discussion there), and in idiomatic expressions such as numa kwasa
kwa- (big small stay-) ‘spread the news’.
The feminine form of the indefinite n@k@- ‘other, another’ appears in the distributive
headless adverbial n@k@m n@k@m (another.fem.sg+acc/loc another.fem.sg+acc/loc) ‘bit of
everything; in a random way’.
The feminine form of the interrogative ak@- ‘which, where’ is used in the formation of a
general locational interrogative ak@m (which.fem.sg+loc) ‘where’. This form is also used to
enquire about the location of a singular object belonging to the feminine gender, and in a
complex construction to express the meaning ak@m t@-ku (which.fem.sg+loc stay-compl.ss)
‘where from’ (see §10.4). (See §6.2.4 on plural agreement with s@ ‘who’ to enquire about
someone whose sex is unknown.)
The feminine form of gender-sensitive demonstratives is used in adverbial demonstratives, such as kl@m (dem.prox+fem.sg+loc) ‘here’, al@m (dem.dist+fem.sg+loc) ‘there’. The
feminine form of the proximate demonstrative k@ is used in negative interjections kal or ka
(dem.prox+fem.sg+3fem.sgnom) ‘no! not that!’ (pronounced with falling intonation and high
intensity of the vowel).
The feminine form of the cardinal numeral nakam@y ‘one, only one’ (§10.6.1) is used
in counting, e.g. nakam@y, viti, mugul, a:li ‘one, two, three, four’. It often replaces the masculine form naka-d@-m@y in noun phrases (even when counting men). The adverb nakamib
(one.fem.sg+adv) ‘together’ is based on the feminine form nakam@y.
E. The ﬁnal piece of evidence in favour of the unmarked character of the feminine gender
comes from child language acquisition. Kerryanne, when she was 3, would use the feminine5.3 Overt gender marking127gender to refer to any unknown object or person, independently of their apparent sex or
size attributes. When looking at the photos of a white man and a boy (both obviously
male), she would invariably ask: Ka-l? (dem.prox+fem.sg-3fem.sgnom) ‘This feminine one is
(what)?’
Statistically, feminine agreement forms are more frequent than masculine, due to the fact
that nouns of quite a few semantic groups, e.g. time and manner, are typically feminine. The
feminine gender in Manambu shows an almost perfect match between a functionally and a
formally unmarked category. In the few instances where both gender forms are equally marked
and there is no formally unmarked choice (as in the case of the adjective ‘old’), the feminine
form is still unmarked functionally. The agreeing adjective yara- ‘ﬁne’ is an exception. It has
two gender forms, each of which is formally marked. The formally unmarked form yara is used
adverbially as well as in the copula complement function, rather than the formally marked
feminine singular yara-l. This conforms to the general tendency in the language to match the
two kinds of markedness.
Most Ndu languages have the markers d ‘masculine’ and l ‘feminine’, also found in personal
pronouns in all languages except Gala. Gala and Manambu share ø as a feminine marker,
e.g. Gala ki ‘she’, kir ‘he’ (related to Proto-Ndu k@ ‘proximal demonstrative’, attested in
Manambu in this function). I hypothesize that the ø-marking in feminine forms is a ManambuGala innovation, and that the forms containing -l are more archaic than the zero-marked
ones.5.3 overt gender marking
Natural gender can be marked on a noun with a human referent, to disambiguate hybrid nouns
(i.e. nouns which can denote either male or female). Lexemes ta:kw ‘woman’ and du ‘man’ are
used to disambiguate the hybrid noun ñan ‘child’, e.g. takwa-ñan (woman+lk-child) ‘girl’, dua-ñan (man-lk-child) ‘boy’.
The root du ‘man’ also occurs in one kinship term, du-a-ma:gw (man-lk-generic.noun)
‘brother’. Its female counterpart is jukwar ‘sister’ (which is non-segmentable, and does not
have any overt gender marker). The same construction can also be used with animate nouns
assigned a ﬁxed gender because of their shape (see B under §5.2.1), e.g. gwa:s ‘turtle’, du-a
gwa:s ‘male turtle’, takwa gwa:s ‘female turtle’. Gender reference of a few hybrid kin terms
can be disambiguated via a compound with the second element -du ‘man’ or -ta:kw ‘woman’,
e.g. yanan ‘grandchild’, yanan-ta:kw ‘granddaughter’, yanan-du ‘grandson’; babay ‘maternal
grandparent’, babay-du ‘maternal grandfather’, babay-ta:kw ‘maternal grandmother’.
A semantically redundant gender marking component -ta:kw ‘woman’ appears with some
kinship nouns with feminine reference: e.g. ña:p and ñap-a-ta:kw ‘mother’s sister’ are used
interchangeably. Along similar lines, ti:d is ‘co-wife; woman of the same clan and generation
as ego’. The term tid@-ta:kw has the same meaning but appears to be used in not quite so usual
contexts: a rare and archaic form tid@-takwa:gw (co.wife-woman+pl) was used to refer to stars
as my potential ‘co-wives’, since stars belong to the same clan group as the one I was adopted
into (also see F in §5.2.1).
Heads of noun phrases containing the noun asa:y as an augmentative marker are always
masculine, e.g. numa-d@ asa:y wuk (big-masc.sg father tooth) ‘huge big tooth’, or asa:y wuk
(father tooth) ‘huge tooth’, and 5.14. That is, asa:y in such noun phrases can be considered
tantamount to an overt gender and augmentative marker.","[151, 152, 153, 154]"

(ii) If the direct object is completely involved in the action, or completely aﬀected by it, it is
likely to be case marked. In 3.15 and T1.8, the man is planning to exterminate the moon,
that is, to fully kill her. The moon is marked with the accusative-locative. In contrast,
‘moon’ in the object function in an idiomatic expression, as in 7.16, is unmarked.

In all these instances the accusative-locative case is in paradigmatic opposition with a zeromarked object. We now consider verbs which allow for a choice between accusative-locative,
dative, and zero marking for their second argument.
(iii) The accusative-locative case with perception ‘see’ and ‘hear’ (see §21.1.2) and ‘ﬁnd, look
for’ indicates telic action whose result was achieved. In 7.18, the verb kwak@- with an
accusative-marked object means ‘ﬁnd’.

children mother look.for-come-1plsubj.vt+3fem.sgbas.vt

This same verb with an object marked by dative case has a frustrative overtone of ‘looking

Verbs of perception, v@ ‘see, look’ and wuk@- ‘hear, listen’, show comparable alternations. A
generic object of ‘see’ is unmarked, as in 7.16. Its O is marked with dative, if the object has
not been seen completely, or intentionally looked at. If the object is fully seen and the action
is volitional and/or telic (meaning ‘look’, or ‘see well’), the object is marked with accusativelocative—see 4.12. In 7.21 the object is deﬁnite and completely seen and the action is volitional:1507 Case Marking7.21 [ [a

‘Having seen the tree (whose leaf I put on the ground), do not go on that road’
In the non-volitional meaning ‘see, notice’, and ‘look around for’, the object is marked with
dative, as in 7.22 (also see 7.28). In 7.22 the head of the village is the topic, and this is why he is
cross-referenced on the verb:

‘Then the two looked around for the number one chief (of the village)’
This meaning of the dative case is consistent with its overtone of future projection: see §13.7.
As shown in §21.1.2, verbs v@- ‘see, look, try, experience’ and wuk@- ‘hear, listen, miss, feel
sorry, obey’ are polysemous. Body parts m@l ‘eye’ and wa:n ‘ear’ are used to diﬀerentiate their
meanings to do with perception: m@l v@- can only mean ‘see, look’, and wa:n wuk@- means
‘hear, listen’. The body parts cannot be cross-referenced on the verb; and a limited number of
constituents can intervene between the body part and the perception verb. The verbs remain
transitive—that is, they can take an object (either case marked or not). These collocations are
similar to complex verbs, and the zero-marked body parts behave like nominal components
in complex verbs (see under I in §7.2). In its meaning of ‘experience’, the verb v@- takes an
unmarked object, as in 7.23 and 21.7.

The verb wuk@- with the dative object means ‘listen to, try to hear’, as in T3.27–8 (‘the snake
sat listening for man’s name’ (trying to hear it)). This verb with an object in the accusativelocative may mean ‘listen to, obey’:

Dative and accusative-locative alternations are also attested with verbs of aﬀect, such as verb
vya- ‘hit, kill’. With an accusative-locative object it implies strong hitting and especially killing
(that is, hitting the victim until they die, as in 3.15 and T1.8). In 7.25, the mother asks the child
if anyone has attempted to hit her just slightly, and so the object is in dative case. The mother
knows that no one has hit the child, and the child is crying for no reason at all.

(iv) The accusative-locative case can mark a number of other arguments, including the third
argument of ditransitive verbs if it is topical and includes all the recipients, as in 7.26;
or if the beneﬁciary or maleﬁciary is fully aﬀected, as in 7.34 (‘for us’ in ﬁrst line).","[174, 175, 176, 177]"
"19.2 Relative clauses473This creates an unusual clause type, only found in relative clauses involving relativization of
possessor.
From a semantic point of view, the phenomenon of ‘extraction’ of an inalienably possessed
noun and change in its argument status is akin to the phenomenon known as double object
construction. For instance, in Tariana (Arawak: Aikhenvald 2003: 156–7) if a possessive construction containing a body part or any inalienably possessed item is in a non-subject function
in a clause, both possessor and the possessee acquire the non-subject case marking and are
treated as objects. In constructions known as ‘external possession’, the possessor is coded as a
‘core grammatical relation of the verb and in a constituent separate from that which contains’
the possessee (see Payne and Barshi 1999: 3).
We have just seen that in Manambu, relative clauses involving possession with a close
link between the possessor and the possessee have the surface structure of either double
subject or double object. And the relativization in Manambu appears to go against the NP
accessibility hierarchy proposed by Keenan and Comrie (1977): the hierarchy predicts that if a
language allows relativization on possessors, it should also allow relativization on arguments
of adpositions. However, the analysis above suggests that in Manambu possessors need to be
transformed into either a subject or an object (depending on the function of the possessive
construction in the main clause), before they can be relativized. Possessors as such cannot
be relativized on. That is, relativization in Manambu does in fact conform to the hierarchy
suggested by Keenan and Comrie.
If there is a close association between the process and the result, the ‘associated result’ can
also be relativized on. This is illustrated in 19.19: the man looked into the house and saw the
ﬁre lit by the woman (CA is O in the relative clause and in the main clause), and also saw what
literally translates as ‘the smoke that she was cooking’—that is, the smoke associated with, or
coming from, her cooking:

‘He saw inside (the house) the ﬁre lit by that old woman, the smoke of her cooking (lit.

Along similar lines, 19.20 literally translates as ‘these are the pictures which they spoke at
a name debate called “saki” ’, meaning ‘these are the pictures to do with (that is, taken at the
time of) a name debate “saki” ’:

‘These are the pictures of them speaking at the name debate “saki” ’ (lit. name debate

There are no grammatical restrictions on the nature of an associated participant.
Since any core argument can be relativized on, ambiguity may arise: 19.21 allows for two
interpretations—since both participants, the man and his companion, are marked with the
same third person singular masculine cross-referencing:47419 Other Dependent Clauses19.21 k@-d@

‘This companion of his said to that man whom he was about to hit: “I won’t hit you” ’
In the context of the story, only the second reading is appropriate. If the common argument
and the core argument(s) of the main clause require diﬀerent gender and number marking, no
ambiguity arises—see 19.28.
Overt expression of participants in a relative clause is an alternative way of disambiguating
the role of the CA. A clause kwa-na-d-@ wi (stay-act.foc-3masc.sgbas.vt-lk house) is ambiguous: adding an additional argument allows us to disambiguate between ‘a house that stays (is
located) on a hill’ and ‘a house where someone stays’:

wi]-ad
man stay-act.foc-3masc.sgbas.vt-lk house-3masc.sgnom
‘It is a house where a man stays (lives)’
Any relative clause can be used without a head. If the head is omitted, the verb takes the
case marking which the common argument would have taken had it been there. In 14.122 the
headless relative clause, ‘(people) who do not work’, is in the A function of a main clause,
and in T2.67 (‘those we were talking about’) it is in S function. A dative case-marked headless
relative clause is illustrated in 19.23a. The omitted common argument is in the O function in
the relative clause, and in the function of second argument of the complex verb ‘ask’ which
requires dative marking:
[a-di
19.23a g@ñ@r bas s@-k@-tua-di
later ﬁrst plant-fut-1sgsubj.vt-3plbas.vt dem.dist-pl
laku-mar-tua-di:k]
understand-neg.sub-1sgsubj.vt-3plbas.vt+dat
‘I will ask later about (the ones) I do not understand’
If the CA had not been omitted, it would have taken the dative case:
19.23b g@ñ@r bas s@-k@-tua-di
[a-di

laku-ma:r-tua-di
maj@k]
understand-neg.sub-1sgsubj.vt-3plbas.vt word+lk+dat
‘I will ask later about words I do not understand’
And in 19.24a the omitted CA is an S in the relative clause. In the main clause it is a location,
marked with the comitative case (see §7.9). Since the CA is omitted, the case marking goes onto
the verb.
19.24a [a

tamiya-wa]
mæy
dem.dist.fem.sg pot sit-3fem.sgsubj.vt+3fem.sgbas.vt area+lk-com come.impv
‘Come by the area where that pot sits’
This is how what looks like a fully inﬂected verb can take a case marker (see §7.11, for
the discussion of case marking on verbs). A similar example is in T3.43, with a headless
relative clause ata wa-tua-di-a-wa (then say-1sgsubj.vt-3plbas.vt-lk-com) ‘with those (the
words) which I was saying’.
We can recall, from 19.7–8, that a relative clause follows a demonstrative and precedes an
adjective modifying a common argument. This same order holds if the CA is omitted, as in
19.25. The CA is the O function in both relative and main clause:

‘I will tell that little (bit of a story) which I forgot’
A headless relative clause in an elliptical sentence looks exactly like a main clause would
look. A speaker heard a woman shout from the next-door house, and asked S@-k@-l-al? (whoobl-fem.sg-3fem.sgnom) ‘Who is this?’ Gemaj answered 19.26:
19.26 anaki

dem.curr.rel+across.away house+lk+loc sit-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt
‘(It is the one who) lives in previously mentioned the house across from us (meaning our
next-door neighbour Esther-Yuaya:b)’
An alternative interpretation for this clause could have been ‘She lives in previously mentioned the house across from us’; but this interpretation would not have made sense under
the circumstances. That is, a headless relative clause—if it is not negated—can sometimes be
distinguished from a main clause by context only. If it is negated, it takes the dependent clause
negator -ma:r- which a normal main clause does not take (except under special circumstances:
§14.5.3). In addition, all relative clauses, including headless ones, can be used as complementation strategies—see §19.8.
Relative clauses are very common in every genre of Manambu. An alternative strategy is
verb-noun compounds.","[499, 500, 501, 502]"
"20.1 Major constituents509A pronoun can also be followed by a personal name, as in wun Walinum ‘me Walinum’ and
20.11 (which contains three appositional NPs similar to those in 20.2).
A.Ib. Additional meanings of kinship terms asa:y ‘father’ and amæy ‘mother’ in appositional noun phrases. These have somewhat idiosyncratic meanings. We can recall, from §5.3
and 5.14, that the noun asa:y ‘father’ can be used with or without the adjective ‘big’ as a kind
of augmentative, e.g. numa-d@ asa:y wuk (big-masc.sg father tooth) ‘very big tooth’, or simply
asa:y wuk ‘very big tooth’. The noun amæy is also used as a kind of augmentative in amæy ta:b
(mother hand) ‘thumb’. The combination amæy ta:kw (mother wife) refers to the ﬁrst, elder
wife (the term for non-ﬁrst wife is g@ña ta:kw ‘last+lk wife’ (or tail+lk wife), as in T2.50).
A.II. A name of an object (typically, a ritually important one) followed by the word denoting
this object, e.g. Mak@mawi n@b@k ‘Makemawi mountain’ (Manambu name for Ambunti mountain), K@b@nwali kara:b ‘men’s house called Kebenwali’. The ﬁrst noun takes the linker (see
§4.1.1), e.g. Pakan@bra kara:b (Pakaneber+lk men’s.house) ‘men’s house called Pakaneber’,
Waikab-@ kara:b ‘men’s house called Waikab’.
A.III. An appositional construction denoting extension of class consists of a noun followed by
the generic m@wi ‘things like that’. This generic noun is not used anywhere else in the language
(and cannot occur on its own). It is semantically comparable to the associative non-singular
discussed at §6.2.2. And the two are in complementary distribution: we can recall that the
associative non-singular can only be formed on personal names, e.g. Nelma-b@r (Nelma-ass)
‘Nelma and others associated with her’ (6.29). The generic noun m@wi can be used with any
noun, except personal names, deﬁnite nouns, and nouns with a uniquely identiﬁable referent.
A noun phrase containing m@wi is indeﬁnite, and usually has no other modiﬁers (including
quantiﬁers), as in 18.14 (ñapwi m@wi ‘ﬁrewood and things like that’, gu m@wi ‘water and things
like that’), T3.24 and 14.155 (‘children and things like that’), and 20.3:

‘That very one (previously mentioned) (topical) snake having gone (and) killed pigs and
things like that brought (them) to her, so that she should not be hungry’ (lit. having said
‘she might be hungry’)
A noun phrase containing m@wi is one NP and not two coordinated ones, for three reasons.
First, it is pronounced as one intonation unit without any pause. Secondly, no other constituent
can intervene between the two. And thirdly, it takes one case marker at the end of the NP—see
20.4 (these criteria are addressed at E, at the end of the section).

yi
ma:
grass things.like.that+dat-too go:neg neg
‘(One) mustn’t go to get grass and things like that’ (lit. for grass and things like that)
The form m@wi can be used to modify a component of a lexicalized complex predicate (see
§17.3), as in 20.5. This shows that at least some such components are essentially nominal in
nature:51020 Clause Types and Discourse-Pragmatic Devices20.5 [wi

‘Cleaning the house, cooking and doing things like that, washing one thing and another,

If a mass noun occurs in a noun phrase with the generic m@wi ‘things like this, things of similar
nature’, the noun phrase requires plural agreement on the verb and on the reactivated topic
demonstrative, as in 6.21.
A.IV. Synonymous noun phrases consist of two near-synonyms (without a linker). These are
rare and are employed as a stylistic device for rhetorical purposes. Unlike the types A.I–III,
the order does not appear to be ﬁxed. In 20.6, ‘(paternal) grandfather’ and ‘ancestor’ refer to
the same person. These terms are almost synonymous: gwa:l on its own can be used to refer to
any paternal ancestor.

‘Having stayed there, he looked around, my grandfather-ancestor’
A similar example is karaki kabay (death.adder snake) ‘the snake death adder’ in T3.3. Both
components of the NP acquire a plural form if they have one, as in 20.7.

people) down by coming’
Appositional noun phrases of this type are very similar to synonymous compounds discussed
under §9.3 (type 4). However, unlike compounds, synonymous appositional NPs form two
grammatical and phonological words.
B. Recognizing the head of a noun phrase. The head of a noun phrase is generally easy to
recognize: it determines number and gender agreement on each of the agreeing modiﬁers (see
§4.3 and §§10.2–3), and cross-referencing on the verb. In 20.2, Kainu is the head of the NP and
is cross-referenced with the masculine singular throughout the noun phrase in brackets, and as
addressee on the verb of speech. As shown in Chapter 7, case markers go onto the head noun
which in most cases is also the last word in a noun phrase. Only the coordinating comitative
behaves diﬀerently: it occurs on each of the coordinands, or just the last one (see §7.9). If the
postposed modiﬁer is a number or a quantiﬁer, the case marking remains on the head noun as
in 7.50 and 10.142 (asa:k viti (dog+lk+dat two) ‘of two dogs’).
C. Noun phrase coordination and disjunction. Noun phrase coordination can be achieved
with a coordinating comitative case -wa (see §7.9), the argument elaboration (inclusory)
construction, or both (§6.2.3). A participant marked with the comitative or its equivalent20.1 Major constituents511(postposition wuk@n) has a lesser role in the joint activity. An alternative is the coordinating
connective wa (§4.5.3 and §7.9). This implies that the conjoined participants are equal, as
in 20.8.
20.8 ata war-b@r
[Lumawad@m wa Parmali]
then go.up-3dubas.p Lumawandem and Parmali
‘Lumawandem and Parmali then went up(stream)’
The connective can also be used in an argument elaboration construction, as in 20.9. This
appears in the speech of those who are highly proﬁcient in Tok Pisin and English, and may well
be a calque.

‘They two mother and son cassowary crossed the hole jumping’ (lit. they two mother
cassowary and child cassowary already crossed the hole well by jumping over it)
The connective wa can occur in a double comitative construction, as an additional mark of
joint activity of both participants, as in 7.79.
There may be a historical connection between the comitative -wa, and the connective wa.
This requires further investigation, as soon as further information on Ndu languages becomes
available. The connective is much rarer in texts and in conversations than any other coordinating device. It is never used to coordinate clauses.
If more than two participants are coordinated, several techniques may be employed. In
20.10, there are ﬁve coordinands (plus the speaker). The noun phrase contains a coordinating
comitative, and the rest of the participants are in apposition to each other. The adverb nakamib
‘together’ (see 6.39 on its use in lieu of argument elaboration constructions) is placed between
the complex noun phrase and the verb which is marked for ﬁrst person plural: the speaker was
among the participants.

‘Abasadu, the little classiﬁcatory granddaughter of my children with Demiyawi, Gabelmag, Yapikudi (and) father, together we went (that time)’
And in 20.11, the connective wa is placed between the last two coordinands. This pattern is
very similar to Tok Pisin and English (in which the speaker was highly proﬁcient). That is, this
may well be a calque from either of these contact languages:

"1809 Derivation and CompoundingI. Nominalizations unmarked for case are used as S in 4.7–8 and 9.1; and as O in 9.2. They
cannot be used as A.
9.1 [kasan war-war] vyak@t-a
peanut go.up-red good-3fem.sgnom
‘Peanuts are coming up ﬁne’ (lit. Peanuts going up is ﬁne)
Deverbal nominalizations in O function are employed as complementation strategies, with
the verb ‘know’, as in 9.2, and ‘ﬁnish’, as in 4.8.
9.2 [na:gw k@-k@] b@r b@ta:y laku-bra
sago eat-red 3du already know-3dusubj.vt+3fem.sgbas.vt
‘They were eating sago, they already knew how to eat sago’ (lit. they already knew sago
eating)
‘Peanuts coming up’ in 9.1 and ‘sago eating’ in 9.2 are diﬀerent from possessive constructions
of type B (§8.1.1), for two reasons. First, given the right pragmatic circumstances, another
possessive construction (types C–E) can replace a B-type possessive construction. In contrast,
no possessive construction can be used instead of an action-nominalization structure. Secondly,
an object of a nominalization can take the accusative-locative case if fully aﬀected, as in 4.7. In
all of 9.1–2 and 4.7–8 nominalizations are employed as complementation strategies (see IX in
§19.8).
An action nominalization can occur in the predicate slot, as in 9.3 (predicate is focused: see
§20.3).

kwa:j
dem.prox+fem.sg banana ﬂying.fox eat-red-3fem.sgnom-3fem.sgnom
‘This is the way of eating of bananas by ﬂying fox’
As can be seen from these examples, nominalizations are assigned feminine gender, in
accordance with its functionally unmarked character (see §5.2.3).
Nominalizations are frequently used as modiﬁers to nouns, e.g. vya-vy-a ta:b (hit+lk-redlk hand) ‘right hand, lit. hitting hand’, wusau-wusau s@p (itch-red skin) ‘itchy skin’, væt-@væt-@j @pis (bite-lk-red-lk ant) ‘an ant that bites a lot’. An alternative interpretation for these
constructions as analogous to relative clauses is in §19.2.2.
II. Dative-aversive-marked nominalizations are used to mark a purpose, or a goal expressed
with what translates as a clausal complement. These are used where one expects the dativeaversive case, as in 9.4 and 13.81–2.

The dative-aversive marked nominalizations are used with a variety of expressions with
negative meaning, such as ‘forbid, refuse’, literally, ‘say no’, as in 9.5, or ‘feel shame’, as in 9.6.

We saw that a nominalization unmarked for case can be used with the expression ‘be hard’ in
4.7 where the diﬃculty is not limited to the future. If a future diﬃculty is implied, a dativeaversive-marked nominalization is employed:
9.9 [apaw@l b@u-m

go-act.foc-1fem.sgbas.vt spirit-lk+acc see-red+dat
‘A spirit is in a haze, this is why it is hard for me to (try and) see the spirit (in future)’
The dative-aversive nominalization can be considered a type of complementation strategy
(§19.8). Unlike other complementation strategies, they often follow the inﬂected verb. This
same form is also used in clauses introduced with k@pa:b ‘in case’—see §13.7.
Dative-aversive nominalizations can be derived from any verb, with the exception of verbs
of C@l/r structure. So, the verb b@l-/bla- ‘talk’ forms a nominalization blab@l ‘talking’; but
not ∗ blabl@k; the same-subject purposive bla:k is used instead (see §13.4). Such gaps in the
paradigm of dative-aversive nominalizations show that their morphological possibilities do not
fully coincide with those of nominalizations discussed at I above. This could be an argument
in favour of analysing them as a separate category.
III. Terminative case-marked nominalizations marked with Vb can only be used with the
polyfunctional verb t@- as support verb. The meaning of the construction is ‘to be on the brink
of doing something; to do just so’:

t@-na-dian

majan
you.fem-lk-masc.sg funerary.ritual give-red+term have/be-act.foc-1plbas.vt
‘We are about to oﬀer you a funerary rite (because we thought you were dead)’
The support verb can be omitted, if its subject is coreferential with that of a juxtaposed
clause:

‘Sitting in the bad man’s hands, having come, here I sit, on the brink of dying’1829 Derivation and CompoundingThe meanings of -Vb with nominalizations agree with the general semantics of the terminative
case (see §7.6). Noun phrases marked with terminative case are typically used as obliques,
unlike nominalizations with the same marking.
IV. Nominalizations as parts of complex predicates with the verb t@- ‘be, stand, have’ as
a support verb have an intensive and habitual meaning, as in 9.12. Compare 9.12a, with an
inﬂected verb, and 9.12b, with a nominalization as part of a complex predicate.
9.12a day-a:k

‘He is angry at them’
9.12b day-a:k
warsam-warsam t@-na-d
they-lk+dat be.angry-red
be-act.foc-3masc.sgbas.vt
‘He is very angry at them’
The verb bla means ‘speak; say magic spells’; a person who keeps saying magic spells is called
yanu bla-b@l t@-kwa-na-d-@ du (spell say-red stand/have-hab-act.foc-3masc.sgbas.vt-lk man).
Similarly, wuk@mar means ‘forget’, wuk@mar wuk@mar t@- means ‘be forgetful’.
The meaning of a reduplicated nominalization may be only partially predictable: for
instance, reduplicated r@p ‘be full, satisﬁed’ within a complex predicate means ‘equal, same
as’, as in 4.47.
An analytical problem arises here. At the end of §4.2.2 we mentioned multiple word class
membership of fully reduplicated verbal roots. Most of them can be used as inﬂected verbs
(in which case they are interpreted as intensive aspect forms: see §12.8), and also as parts of
complex predicates. This was illustrated with examples 4.47–8; also see 9.13a–b:
t@-na-di
9.13a a-di
pato wali-wali
dem.dist-pl duck walk.around-red be-act.foc-3plbas.vt
‘Those ducks keep wandering around’
9.13b a-di
pato wali-wali-na-di
dem.dist-pl duck walk.around-red-act.foc-3plbas.vt
‘Those ducks are wandering around all the time’
For dynamic verbs, like wali- ‘wander around’, there appears to be a subtle diﬀerence:
nominalizations as parts of complex predicates refer to an atemporal action that keeps repeating, while inﬂected verbs describe something that is happening either right now or at some
particular time (this is why the action focus marker is preferred in examples like 9.13a–b). For
stative verbs there is no such diﬀerence.
In addition, a reduplicated verb root can occur as part of a complex predicate with support
verbs other than t@- ‘be, stand’, with the basic meaning of action nominalization. The noise
of rolling is described in 9.14, and this warrants the use of the polyfunctional verb na- ‘be (of
natural phenomena, including noise)’:
9.14 t@m@l-t@m@l ata na:l
roll-red
then be:nat+3fem.sgbas.vt
‘There was a noise of (him) rolling and rolling’9.1 Word class-changing derivations183The reduplicated root triggers feminine agreement, like any nominalization in S function.
Examples like 9.14 are infrequent; nevertheless, they point towards a diﬀerent nature of reduplicated verb roots with a support verb and verbal nominalizations.
V. Emphatic nominalizations are used as manner modiﬁers to a semantically similar (or the
same) verb, as in 9.15.
9.15 wuk@-wuk wuk@-tua
hear-red hear-1sgsubj.vt+3fem.sgbas.vt
‘I am just listening’ (not saying anything; lit. listening I listen)
The emphatic nominalization constructions often have a frustrative connotation: in 9.16
there is an overt contrast between ‘just hearing’ and ‘really talking’.
9.16 wuk@-wuk wuk@-na
yi-yi
suan yi-na
hear-red hear-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt talk-red hard go-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt
‘She does hear (understand) (the language), talking is diﬃcult’ (lit. hearing she hears,
talking is diﬃcult)
A nominalization containing a diﬀerent, but semantically similar, root can modify a verb,
denoting a manner in which the action is performed, as in 9.17:
9.17 væs@-væs ma:y
step-red go.impv
‘Go by stepping carefully’
Just occasionally can a reduplicated verb root be used to modify a verb of a diﬀerent
semantic group, as in 9.18:
9.18 wiya:m
aw
t@m@l-t@m@l aw
t@m@l-t@m@l ata gra:l
house+lk+loc in.turn roll-red
in.turn roll-red
then cry+3fem.sgbas.vt
‘At home she then cried in turn rolling and rolling (lamenting her drowned son)’
VI. Nominalizations in negative constructions as predicate heads are a means of expressing
negative obligation. This is consistent with a typologically widely attested pattern whereby
non-verbal forms are used to express curt commands and strong prohibitions (Aikhenvald
forthcoming a). In 9.19, the mother was trying to explain to her baby daughter that one does
not breastfeed while walking along the road:
9.19 yab@-wa
m@ñ k@-k@ ma:
road+lk-com breast eat-red neg
‘One does not breastfeed while walking’ (lit. There is no breastfeeding along the road)
Such negative statements can refer to something that has not happened yet (as in 9.19 said
before the girl had started breastfeeding—see 7.80), or to something that has already occurred.
The position of the negator is congruent with its position in clauses with a non-verbal
predicate (see §14.1.2). However, an additional problem arises here. We will see in §14.3.3 that
the negative form of the reduplicated intensive aspect of a verb coincides with the reduplicated
verb stem, that is, a nominalization. In negative future, the negator is postposed to the negative
form of an inﬂected verb, making a construction like 9.20 (and in T1.7) inherently ambiguous
between (a) a negated nominalization as a means of expressing negative obligation; and (b) a
negative future of the intensive aspect.","[206, 207, 208, 209, 210]"

Nominal case suﬃxes (with the exception of the terminative, transportative, and comitative
cases) can occur on verbal roots. None of the zero-case morphology applies to verbs: a verb
root cannot occur on its own. The resulting forms diﬀer in their status. In addition, all case
morphology can occur on headless relative clauses (see §19.2.1). Relative clauses in Manambu
have all the tense-aspect and person marking of the main clause (they diﬀer from main clauses
in how they are negated). An example of a headless relative clause marked with a comitative
is kui-kwa-na-di-a-wa (give.to.third.p-hab-act.foc-3plbas.vt-lk-com) ‘with those who usually
give’. These look like instances of case marking on what is homonymous with an inﬂected main
clause verb.
The marker -Vm ‘complete involvement of a second participant’ is reminiscent of -Vm
‘accusative-locative’ whose meaning involves completeness of involvement of an argument, or
an oblique. The marker -Vm occurs on verbal and other roots (see §12.6) indicating completion
of an action, or total achievement of a state, as in kuprap-@-m (bad-lk-loc) ‘it is totally bad’,
7.34, and in 7.85:
7.85 d@-k@-d@
ñan wuk@mar-@-m
he-lk-masc.sg child forget-lk-loc
‘(I) completely forgot his son’
A completive form of r@p ‘be enough’, r@p-@-m ‘fully enough’, is often used in the meaning
of ‘this is perfect; this is ﬁne’. The completive form can only be used as a copula complement
of na- ‘copula for abstract states’ (see §12.6).
Dative -Vk case on a verbal root has same subject purposive meaning (see §13.4.1 and
§19.4.1), as in 7.76 where such forms are used as purpose complements to verbs of motion.
This same form is used in a construction with the auxiliary kur- ‘do’ in its imminent meaning,
e.g. kiya-k kur- (die-purp.ss get/do) ‘be about to die’ (§17.1.2).
The instrumental -Vr appears on a few verbal roots, in a function of manner adverb, as in
væs-@-r mæy (walk-lk-instr come.impv) ‘come by stepping’ (see Aikhenvald forthcoming g,
for further discussion). It also occurs in one lexicalized V-V compound nas-@-k@ta:-r (countlk-try-instr) ‘by counting (when talking about the number of people or days)’.
The substitutive case -yæy on a verb can serve as a sequencing marker with the meaning
‘instead of, rather than’ (§19.3, and examples 19.36–7 and T3.40).
Using cases on verbal roots does not nominalize them. The resulting forms are less prototypically verbal: -Vm and -Vk- marked verbs belong to the group of uninﬂected aspectual
modal forms, and the combination of verb root plus -Vr case can be considered similar to a
manner adverb. The verb forms marked with the substitutive -yæy can be same subject (with
no special subject marking) or diﬀerent subject (and then the subject is marked on them:
see §18.1 for the discussion of this as a general principle in Manambu). The phenomenon
of verbal case as exponent of clausal meanings, and as clause-linking device, is widespread in
Australian languages (Dixon 2002a: 237–8) and in a number of languages from other parts of
the world. The discussion of Manambu verbal case in typological perspective is in Aikhenvald
(forthcoming d).","[192, 193, 194]"
"10.6.1 Numerals from one to ten
Numerals from one to ten are given in Table 10.8, together with an indication of their additional meanings and composition (for numbers over four).
Numerals ‘one’, ‘two’, and ‘three’ diﬀer from other numerals in that they have meanings
additional to counting. Numeral ‘one’ stands apart from other numerals in a number of
properties outlined in A below. Numbers ‘two’ and ‘three’ are discussed in B and C respectively.
Words for ‘ﬁve’ and ‘ten’ contain the term for ‘hand, arm’.
Numbers ‘two’ to ‘ten’ can be employed as prehead or posthead modiﬁers; their position in a
noun phrase depends on whether the noun referent is newly introduced or already established,
and whether it is focused on. Just as with quantiﬁers (§10.5), a newly introduced referent is
followed by the numeral. In contrast, number ‘one’ always follows the noun.
Numerals one to ten form one grammatical word. Numerals one to four are underived.
Number ﬁve contains the root for ‘hand’, ta:b-, and the formative -a:b, which could be cognate
to -a:b ‘too’, or to aba:b ‘all’ (see §22.1 on this being a possible calque from Kwoma). Ordinal10.6 Numerals235Table 10.8 Numerals from one to ten

to the linker, as in viti-a-yay (two-lk-ord) ‘second’, mugul-a-yay ‘third’, and so on. Ordinal
numbers are non-agreeing modiﬁers, similar to quantiﬁers and cardinal numbers ‘two’ to ‘ten’,
in that they occur postposed to a new or non-topical referent, as in 10.129:
10.129 kad

‘This is a third village; it is (the case) that we settled in the third village’
Ordinal numerals occur preposed to a topically established or deﬁnite referent (see §20.2):
10.130 a

yi-l@-l
dem.dist.fem.sg three-lk-ord house+lk+all go-3fem.sgsubj.p-3fem.sgbas.p
aka
dem.dist.react.top.fem.sg
‘It is that she went to that third house’
An ordinal numeral can be used without a nominal head, and it can then take the appropriate
case marker, as in 10.129. This is in contrast to cardinal numbers which do not take case
marking.
All numbers can be used in counting, as in ‘one, two, three’, and as modiﬁers; the number ‘one’
is unique in that the form used for counting (or number recital) is diﬀerent from forms used in
most other contexts.
A. Number ‘one’ has three forms. The form nakam@y has two uses: it occurs in counting ‘one,
two, three’, as shown in 10.131—an incitement for the two children who are diving to come up
again:
10.131 nakam@y viti mugul a:li, taba:b, a-war-@y
one
two three four ﬁve
impv-go.up-voc
‘One, two, three, four, ﬁve—up you go!’
As mentioned in §5.1.1, nakam@y can be used as a prehead modiﬁer meaning ‘only one, one
(of many)’. Then it optionally takes an inﬁxed gender agreement marker: naka-d@-m@y means
‘only one (masculine)’, and naka-m@y ‘only one’ is feminine. This refers to one turtle out of
many in 10.132:23610 Closed Classesgwa:s aka
ya-na
10.132 nakam@y-a
one.single.fem-lk turtle dem.dist.react.top.fem.sg come-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt
‘One single turtle (out of many) came’
In 10.133, the masculine form refers to the only child:
10.133 wun-a-d@
nak-a-d@-m@y-a
du-a-ñan
ad@ka
I-lk-masc.sg one-lk-masc.sg-very-lk man-lk-child dem.dist.react.top+masc.sg
t@-na-d
stand-act.foc-3masc.sgbas.vt
‘My only son (about whom we are talking again) is standing (here)’
This form is the only one in the language to distinguish two gender forms, but no number
forms. The use of nakam@y in counting goes together with the functionally unmarked character
of the feminine gender. These forms are likely to be compounds consisting of nak- ‘one’, -a‘linker’, followed by the gender marker (-d(@) ‘masculine’, ø ‘feminine’), and m@y ‘real; very’.
The two further forms, nak and n@, are both used as posthead modiﬁers and are almost
synonymous: one can refer to children of the same mother (or to those who belong to the
same maternal clan) as ya:l nak waku-di or ya:l n@ waku-di (belly one come.out-3plbas.vt)
‘they came out of the same belly’. Both jay@b nak and jay@b n@ mean ‘one moment, quickly,
instantaneously’. In enumerating objects one by one, the form n@ appears to be somewhat
preferred. Both nak and n@ can mark indeﬁnite and newly introduced referents. In 10.134,
from the very beginning of a story, the speaker introduced the referent as ta:kw nak (woman
one) ‘a woman’. A variant ta:kw n@ is also used in the same function.
ñan-ugw@wa
kwa:l
10.134 ta:kw nak l@-k@-di
woman one she-obl-pl child-pl+lk+com stay+3fem.sgbas.p
‘One woman lived with her children’
However, there are a number of diﬀerences between nak and n@, along the following lines:
1. The numeral nak, but not n@, can be used without a nominal head, as in:
wa-di
nak ata ka:l
10.135 kudi
nak ak
mouthful one impv+eat say-3plbas.p one then eat+3fem.sgbas.p
‘ “Eat one mouthful!”, they said, she then ate one (mouthful)’
It can also head a predicate, which is not the case for n@, and can have a meaning of ‘same
(as previous)’, as in 10.136:
10.136 ma:j
nak-al
word/talk one-3fem.sgnom
‘This is the same word’
2. The numeral nak (but not n@) often has the meaning of ‘another, one more’. In 10.137,
Walinum volunteers to tell another short story. Nak ‘another one’ is used headlessly; it can
have the same meaning as a modiﬁer.

ma: nak aka
I-lk+fem.sg small+fem.sg again one dem.dist.react.top.fem.sg
wa-k@-tua
tell-fut-1sgsubj.vt+3fem.sgbas.vt
‘I will tell another little one of mine again’10.6 Numerals237This use of nak is reminiscent of the use of the indeﬁnite n@k@ ‘another’, illustrated in 10.3
and 10.52. It is possible that forms nak, n@, and n@k@ are etymologically related. In rapid
casual speech, n@k@ can be pronounced as n@ (in agreement with A3 under §2.6), e.g. rapid
speech n@ ja:p n@ ja:p kur-ku, normal speech n@k@ ja:p n@k@ ja:p kur-ku (another.fem.sg thing
another.fem.sg thing get-compl.ss) ‘having taken one thing and another’. Unlike both nak and
n@, n@k@ is an agreeing prehead modiﬁer.
3. The numeral nak can be used in opposition to other numbers, while n@ is not used this way.
An example is under 10.138—a description of what happens during warfare:
kiya-kwa-na-d
d@y viti, mugul, a:li, ata
10.138 du nak ak@s
man one neg.hab die-hab-act.foc-3masc.sgbas.vt they two three four then
kiya-kwa-na-di
die-hab-act.foc-3plbas.vt
‘One man never dies, two, three, four die’
The form n@ is only occasionally used in opposition to another number, but never more than
one, as in 10.139:
o bap
viti t@-ku
10.139 bap
n@ t@-k@-na-d@wun-@k
month one stay-fut-act.foc-1masc.sgbas.vt-conf or month two stay-compl.ss
ya-k-na-d@wun-@k
come-fut-act.foc-1masc.sgbas.vt-conf
‘I will stay (away) for one month, or I will come back having stayed (away) two months’
4. Only nak and not n@ can undergo full reduplication. A reduplicated form nak-a-nak (onelk-one) has two meanings: ‘one by one’, as in 10.140, and ‘few, not too many’, as in 10.141.
10.140 nak-a-nak kur-ta:y
s@pur-taka-bana
one-lk-one get-cotemp shell-put-1plsubj.vt+3fem.sgbas.vt
‘Having got (peanuts) one by one we shell them’
10.141 wur@bi-adi
k@-di,
nak-a-nak adiya
large.mosquito-3plnom dem.prox-pl one-lk-one dem.dist.react.top+pl
‘These are large mosquitoes, they are few’ (since this is dry season)
This same form can be used adverbially, meaning ‘one by one’, as in 21.4. These uses may well
have resulted from a Tok Pisin inﬂuence: cf. Tok Pisin wan wan ‘few’; wanpela wanpela ‘one by
one’. Nowadays they are part of everyday usage. The ﬁnal k can be elided in fast speech.
5. The form nak is strongly preferred to n@ in complex numbers higher than ten (see §10.6.2).
In its use as a marker of newly introduced referents, the numeral ‘one’ is inﬂuenced by a similar
usage of the number ‘one’, wanpela, in Tok Pisin. Young speakers, especially children and
teenagers whose major language of communication is Tok Pisin, display a peculiar pattern
of code-switching, introducing a new referent, for example wanpela ta:kw (one:TP woman)
and then correcting this to ta:kw nak (as in 10.134). Some speakers even use both Tok Pisin
and Manambu lexemes in this same function, as shown in §22.4 (wanpela du nak (one:TP man
one) ‘a man’). This is unusual since the Tok Pisin numeral does not go into the same slot as its
Manambu correspondent, but rather keeps the Tok Pisin linear order. In most instances, a Tok
Pisin number occurs together with a Tok Pisin word, as in wanpela taim (one time) ‘once’ (see
Aikhenvald forthcoming c).
As shown in §5.1.1, the root nak occurs in two other forms, nak-a-l-@b (one-lk-fem.sg-term)
‘together’ (of a group consisting of women only, or of a mixed group) and its synonym nakamib23810 Closed Classes‘together’ (which is most likely derived from nakam@y and the terminative case frequently
employed in deriving adverbs)—see 16.106.
Unlike other numbers, ‘one’ has the adverb ta:y ‘ﬁrst’ in lieu of a corresponding ordinal
number, as in 4.61, 13.15, and T2.47. An alternative term is an adverb bas ‘ﬁrstly’, as in bas
yawi waku-n (ﬁrst work go.out-seq) ‘going out to work for the ﬁrst time’. The term for last is
gañ. Further terms involving the idea of being ﬁrst or last include g@m ‘ﬁrst pregnancy’, k@t@p-@ m@ñ (eat-close-lk breast) ‘last child’, amay ta:kw (mother woman/wife) ‘ﬁrst wife’, g@ñ-a
ta:kw (last-lk wife) ‘non-ﬁrst wife’; ap-a s@ (bone-lk name) ‘ﬁrst name’ (of the many names
one has), as contrasted to s@gliak ‘any name other than the ﬁrst one’. The term kuk@-s@buk
(late-sibuk) ‘the latest/most senior of all initiated men (simbuks)’ was suggested as a term for
‘ﬁrst priest’.
B. Number ‘two’ has an additional, non-numerical, meaning. We saw in Table 6.1 that the
numeral viti or its cliticized version -v@ti marks dual on several kin terms.
Case marking on NPs provides a way of distinguishing viti as a dual marker and viti as
number two (also see B in §6.1). When the number ‘two’ acts as a number, it does not take case
marking—we saw in 7.50 that this is a general property of numbers. This is shown in 10.142.
10.142 [asa:k
viti] yaga-na
dog+lk+dat two be.afraid-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt
‘She is afraid of two dogs’
In contrast, a noun marked for dual takes case marking:
10.143 d@-k@-b@r jukwar-a-v@ti:k wapa-ku
he-poss-du sister-lk-du+dat leave-compl.ss
‘Having left his two sisters . . . ’
The number ‘two’, when reduplicated, has a somewhat idiomatic meaning of ‘muddled’, as in
10.144—this was Kawindu’s explanation for a mess up in local ﬂights:
10.144 ma:j viti-viti t@-na-b@r
story two-two have-act.foc-3dubas.vt
‘They two tell muddled stories’ (lit. have two stories each?)
C. Number ‘three’ as a cardinal number has an additional, non-numerical quantifying meaning
of ‘a few, several’. Whether mugul is used in a numerical meaning or not is usually clear from
the context. In 7.50, we were leaving exactly three days later. In 10.131 and 10.138, mugul is one
of the numbers used in counting. In 10.145, mugul ‘few’ is contrasted to another quantiﬁer—it
cannot possibly mean ‘three’.
da-di
10.145 orait mugul æywan ma:, mugul-a-b@
alright few
many neg few-lk-already go.down-3plbas.p
‘OK, (there were) few, not many, few people went down (river)’
When an ordinal number is formed on ‘three’, its meaning is always strictly numerical, as in
10.130. A noun phrase with the quantiﬁer mugul ‘few’ can trigger dual agreement, if the number
of referents is about two, as in 6.40. Or it can trigger plural agreement, if there are more than
two referents, as in 10.146. If mugul means ‘three’, agreement is always plural.

10.146 gurawa
mugul-a bal-adi,
many-3plnom
you+lk+com few-lk pig-3plnom I
‘There are few pigs with you, I, (my pigs) are many’10.6 Numerals239The non-numerical quantiﬁer usage of mugul suggests that its numerical meaning is relatively
recent. This is corroborated by the data from other Ndu languages: while terms for ‘one’ and
‘two’ are relatively stable throughout the family, the terms for numerals from three onwards
vary. The Iatmul form for ‘three’ can also mean ‘few’ (Jendraschek forthcoming). (The two
forms equally reconstructible for Proto-Ndu ‘three’ are ∗ m@g@l and ∗ k@ p(w)@k; their reﬂexes
are scattered across the family: see Aikhenvald forthcoming b.)
Numerals ‘two’ and ‘three’ can take the derivational suﬃx -k@r @b ‘together’, as in viti-k@r @b
‘two together’ and mugul-a-k@r@b ‘three together’ (but not ∗ a few together). Both numbers have
a strictly numerical meaning in such derivations (see 10.47). A derivation containing -k@r@b can
be used to refer to humans, as in T3.52 (where it modiﬁes a pronoun, ‘they two, two of them
together’). It can modify a noun with a non-human referent, as in 10.147. This is an example
of a split noun phrase:
avæs
mæn
10.147 viti-k@r@b
two-together impv+step foot
‘Step with two feet together!’ (while walking on a narrow log in lieu of a bridge)
Just like any numeral, a derivation marked with -k@r@b can be used as a posthead modiﬁer, as
in 10.47, or as a prehead modiﬁer. In the latter case, the noun takes a modiﬁcation marker, e.g.
viti-k@r@b-a ta:kw (two-together-lk woman) ‘two women together’ (e.g. two co-wives).
Numbers from ‘two’ to ‘ten’ can occur with the approximative suﬃx -p@k ‘more or less’, e.g.
9.35, and with -r@b ‘fully’ (see §9.2.1). If combined with either suﬃx, the number mugul has a
strictly numerical meaning, ‘three’. The number ‘one’ does not combine with any suﬃxes.","[261, 262, 263, 264, 265, 266]"
"22.3 Loans from Western Iatmul and elsewhere601In Harrison’s (1990a: 20) words, ‘from an historical perspective, the circulation of ritual
forms in the regional trading system seems to have been a key formative inﬂuence on Manambu
society . . . , because the most valued scarce resources among the Manambu, and the items of
strategic prestige value in the political system of their villages, were rights in ritual property,
much of which the Manambu acquired from the Iatmul. Manambu ritual and cosmology
seem, in fact, to be not only a kind of patchwork of the ritual and cosmological traditions
of neighbouring societies, but a largely bought patchwork, acquired piecemeal through trade.’
Trading ownership of names and cults is a feature of numerous Sepik cultures—including the
Kwoma (Bowden 1983: 67), the Abelam, and the Iatmul (Bateson 1958).
These ‘acquisitions’ used to surface in various speech styles, many of them eﬀectively lost
in modern days. Harrison (1990a: 78) reports that shamanic spirits used to speak ‘through
their human mediums in a special, arcane language, intelligible only to those with many
years of experience of shamanic séances, which is actually a kind of Manambu-based jargon
with exaggerated outré Iatmul features’. Harrison stresses that in Manambu, ‘all speciﬁcally
“religious” forms of speech borrow heavily from Western Iatmul’. We will see, in §22.6.1, that
due to the encroaching inﬂuence of Western culture (including the virtual obsolescence of
initiation) most of the religious registers are rapidly falling into oblivion, and with them the
‘Iatmulized’ forms of speech.
Some Iatmul imports are still actively used in poetic register, and are identiﬁed by speakers
themselves as being originally Iatmul. The songs of foiled marriages and love aﬀairs, known as
namay and sui, and also mourning songs (gra-kudi) are a case in point. These poetic literary
forms (improvised by performers) consist of two parallel stanzas, each referred to either as ap@k
‘side, part’, or ag@k ‘side, counterpart (one of two)’. Such songs typically consist of a string of
not-too-complex sentences interspersed with totemic address terms and names (often relating
to the clan of the addressee or the ‘character’ of the song). The second stanza restates the
ﬁrst one in diﬀerent wording using what the Manambu speakers call ‘shadowy’ register, or ‘the
other side’ (ag@kem ‘on the (other) side of two’). This reﬂects the binarism, or ‘parallelism’, a
pervasive feature of the Sepik culture—in Bateson’s (1958: 239) words, ‘the idea that everything
in the world has its equal and opposite counterpart’ (also see Harrison 1983: 20, on binarism
in the song styles).
While gra-kudi, the mourning songs, are the prerogative of women (typically, old and knowledgeable ones), namay and sui can be sung by both men and women. Harrison (1983) put
together a collection of namay sung by men (also see his comment on the role of mythological
setting and secret knowledge in the creation of namay). Women also compose namay and
sui, and sing them—traditionally, on women-only ﬁshing expeditions or anywhere where men
would not be able to overhear them. I recorded over twenty namay sung by women (most of
them over 50); but was told not to share them with anyone since they discuss the foiled loves,
suitors, and nostalgic feelings for men other than their husbands, and if I disclosed them, this
might get these women into trouble.
My estimate is that the ‘other side’ register may have traditionally contained several hundred words. At present, few people have complete knowledge of it. A number of kinship
terms and items from other semantic groups have a ‘shadowy’ equivalent, while most do
not. The kin terms which are the same in both ‘sides’ include gwa:l ‘father’s father’, yæ:y
‘father’s mother’ (similarly to the ‘Mother-in-law’ language in some Australian languages:
Dixon 1990), kagr@s ‘son’s wife’, and kajal ‘brother’s wife’, as well as numerous body part
terms, such as m@l ‘eye’, and verbs, e.g. væk@r ‘fall’, v@- ‘see’. Many clan address names have
a shadowy equivalent—for instance, the equivalent of g@ñap ‘address term for Yimal clan’ is
kwalap.","[627, 628]"
"20.1 Major constituents515Only two such foreign elements have been observed in the domain of complex predicates, or
clauses. One is a Tok Pisin modal mas ‘must’ which can occur with third person imperative in
the meaning of strong obligation (13.22). The other is Tok Pisin nogut which was once used
by a speaker as a nonce code-switch accompanied by a dependent negative clause (14.125),
mirroring a corresponding structure in Manambu.
E. The limits of a noun phrase. A few more questions remain. First, how do we determine
the boundaries of a noun phrase? The relevant criteria include having one case per noun
phrase (see §7.1). So, for instance, the allative case form of an appositional noun phrase
Mak@mawi n@b@k ‘Makemawi mountain’ is Mak@mawi n@b@k@r . This is in contrast to 16.55
where [adaki n@b@k@r] [pause] [Mak@mawir] (dem.dist.masc.sg.across.away hill+lk+dat,
Makemawi+dat) ‘to (that) hill across (away from us), to Makemawi’ corresponds to two noun
phrases. This brings us to the next criterion—that of prosodic cohesion. The insertion of a
pause between the two allative-marked constituents indicates that these are indeed two noun
phrases.
Also, if a noun phrase appears in a highlighting focus construction it is focused as a whole: a
part of an NP cannot be focused separately. This explains why no constituent can be focused in
relative clauses, as shown in Table 19.1. That is, focalization is another criterion which helps us
determine the boundaries of an NP. Non-word class-changing suﬃxes detailed in §9.2 appear
once per noun phrase. And the emphatic enclitic -ya always goes onto the last word in a noun
phrase.
And, in addition to all this, we saw that the word order in a noun phrase is mostly ﬁxed—
except for the two instances of variable order in D above. For instance, an adjective followed
by a demonstrative belong to diﬀerent noun phrases, even if pronounced without a pause. An
example is in 20.19:
20.19 [wun kwasa
t@-lwun-@k]
[kwasa]
I
small+fem.sg be/stand-1fem.sgbas.p-conf small+fem.sg
[ [k@laki
Kudaway] l@-k@
ñ@np@k]
dem.prox+fem.sg+across Kudaway she-obl+fem.sg child+like
‘I was little (when the war started), little, like the daughter (lit. feminine child) of this
Kudaway across away’
This example contains two noun phrases: one is an adjective ‘small’ (feminine singular) used
headlessly, and the other is a possessive construction accompanied with the suﬃx -p@k ‘like’
with the possessor modiﬁed by a demonstrative. The speaker, Kukelyabau, spoke very fast,
and there were no pauses between the two. The placement of the demonstrative is indicative of
an NP boundary.
But are noun phrases in Manambu always contiguous? They are not. However, instances
of split noun phrases are limited to noun phrases with numerals and quantiﬁers as modiﬁers.
The numeral or the quantiﬁer can be split from the rest of the NP and postposed to the verb,
as a clariﬁcation (see §20.2). An example is in 20.20: the two women were staying together;
this togetherness is emphasized by positioning the numeral modiﬁer after the verb. There is no
pause before ‘two’—as would have been expected, if this were an afterthought.
[viti]

ta:kw] pause abra
kwa-b@r
dem.dist-du woman pause dem.dist.react.top+du stay-3dubas.p two
‘Those women stayed (topical) two (of them together)’
We return to the functions of this postposed numeral in §20.2.
If a relative clause contains an additional argument or oblique, it can be placed into a
sentence-initial position as a means of focalizing it. We can recall, from Table 19.1, that no51620 Clause Types and Discourse-Pragmatic Devicesconstituent of a relative clause can be focused independently. That is, removing an argument
or an oblique from within the relative clause and preposing it is the only available means of
focusing on it. Note that in such cases a relative clause—but not the whole noun phrase—is
discontinuous:

tayib
waku-d
before+term go.out-3masc.sgbas.p
‘That little boy who drowned (lit. to water that one which went) left home before (his
mother)’
The order of words without such preposition would have been:
20.21b [a-d@

yi-d-@

ñan]
dem.dist-masc.sg water+all go-3masc.sgbas.p-lk small-masc.sg child

before+term go.out-3masc.sgbas.p
‘That little boy who drowned (lit. went to water) left home before (his mother)’
We saw in §10.2.3 that reactivated topic demonstratives do not form one NP with the noun
they refer to (typically an O, an S, or a location). They agree with this noun in gender and
number, but can never take any cases or suﬃxes or be arguments of postpositions. There can be
an intonation break between a demonstrative and an NP it refers to (as in 10.66 and in 20.20)—
something atypical for an NP. Within a clause, they tend to occur immediately preceding the
verb, as in 20.20 and 20.22.

Summing up: the accusative-locative case in Manambu can mark (i) obligatory arguments as
well as (ii) obliques. In (i), it is in opposition to zero-marked nouns and to nouns marked with
dative case. In (ii), it is in opposition to allative and to terminative cases. What the two uses
have in common is the meaning of complete involvement of a non-subject constituent (object,
recipient, possessor, location, or direction) and the focus on result. This agrees with the way in
which the same marker is used on verbs. We return to this in §7.11.7.4 dat i v e -av e r s i v e c a s e
The dative case, marked with -Vk, has a wide variety of functions covering (A) addressee and
beneﬁciary; (B) purpose and destination; (C) cause and reason; (D) ‘lest, for fear of’; and (E)
bodily states. We saw in §7.3 (7.20, 7.22, 7.25, and also T3.28) that dative can mark the second
argument of a number of verbs if the argument is not completely aﬀected or the action is atelic.
Dative obligatorily marks the second argument of a number of verbs discussed under (F) below.
The dative case is highly polysemous. However, to simply say that the dative case always
marks an object which is not primarily aﬀected would be a simpliﬁcation. An argument or an
oblique marked with the dative case can be cross-referenced on the verb. The aversive meaning
of -Vk can be easily shown to ‘derive’ from a more general meaning of the dative as a marker of7.4 Dative-aversive case153second argument of verbs to do with emotions, such as fear. If a dative-marked noun is used in
isolation, it may acquire aversive reading depending on its semantics. The dative marker could
be cognate to the future and purposive markers -(V)k-—we return to this in §7.11.
A. Addressee, or beneficiary of ditransitive verbs, is marked with dative, as shown in 7.35–
6. Also see examples of ‘give’ in §4.2.2.

When I asked why Avatip women were so keen on smoking large quantities of ﬁsh, the answer

A nominal component of a complex verb ‘do cooking’ can be marked with dative, as in 17.44.
This is the only case this form can take.
C. Cause and reason are also marked with dative. A ﬁght between two women broke out in
front of our house in Avatip. I asked a young boy what was happening. His short answer was
du-a:k (man-lk+dat), meaning ‘because of a man (they are ﬁghting)’.","[178, 179, 180]"
"1567 Case Markingis used with directional nouns, such as mapa-taba:r (right-hand+lk+all) ‘to the right’, akitabar (left-hand+lk+all) ‘to the left’, and with demonstratives, e.g. al@-da:r (dem.dist.fem.sgdown+all) ‘that small (one) downwards’. It is very rarely used with animate nouns. Allative
with time nouns refers to a future time span, as in 7.50:
7.50 [ña:r
mugul] kwa-ku
yi-k-na-bran
day+lk+all three stay-compl.ss go-fut-act.foc-1dubas.vt
‘Having stayed for about three days, we will go away’
In its second meaning, the -Vr case is typically used with nouns with inanimate referents
used as instruments, e.g. mæn-@r (foot-lk+instr) ‘on foot’, and:
7.51 d@ wa:j mij-a:r
vya-d@-l
he eel ﬁsh.spear-lk+instr kill-3masc.sgsubj.p-3fem.sgbas.p
‘He killed an eel with a spear’
The instrumental of kudi ‘language’ means ‘in a language’, as in 7.52.
7.52 [t@p-a
kudi-r]
at@ta wa-u
village-lk language-instr how say-1sgimpv
‘How am I to say (this) in the village language?’
The -Vr case with non-locational inanimate nouns has a preferential instrumental reading:
sana:r (money+lk+all) normally means ‘with money’ rather than ‘towards money’. A few
nouns allow for multiple interpretations. The word kabak has two meanings, ‘stone’ and ‘lot of
money’; the form kabak-@r can be understood either as ‘towards a stone; into a stone’; ‘with a
stone’, or ‘with a lot of money’ (but hardly as ‘towards a lot of money’).
This case is often used with locational nouns used as a means for reaching a destination:
7.53 asay-wa
da-lwun
Sambri-r
val-a:r
father-com go.down-1sgbas.p Chambri-all/instr canoe-lk+instr
‘I went down with my father, towards the Chambri lakes, on a canoe’
The form Sambrir is ambiguous: it can mean ‘via the Chambri lakes’, or ‘towards the
Chambri lakes’. This indeterminacy can be resolved only by context, or with an appropriate
question. We will see in §10.4 that question words distinguish allative (akr@l ‘where to?’) and
instrumental (ak@-r (what/where-instr) ‘with what, which way?’ and agw-a:r (which/whatlk+instr) ‘with what thing, how?’) (as in 7.44).
The instrumental case with means of transport is synonymous with the transportative cases
(see §7.7), e.g. val-a-r, val-a-sap, val-a-say ‘by canoe, by car’.
Synchronically speaking, allative and instrumental are better analysed as homonymous cases
rather than two meanings of one, polysemous, case. We saw in §7.3 that locative and allative
are in a paradigmatic opposition. In contrast, instrumental case is not in any paradigmatic
opposition to other cases; it is almost synonymous with transportative cases when used on a
small group of nouns describing means of locomotion or of reaching a destination. In addition,
allative and instrumental meanings are marked diﬀerently in the interrogative system. The -Vr
form occurs on verb roots with the meaning of manner (§7.11).
The instrumental-allative polysemy is uncommon cross-linguistically. It is attested in a
couple of Australian languages (Dixon 2002a: 168). A formal connection between instrumental
and allative is a feature of various languages of the Sepik area, including a number of Ndu
languages and Kwoma (see Aikhenvald forthcoming b).","[182, 183]"
"60822 Genetic and Areal Relationships22.4.2 Morphological and syntactic integration of Tok Pisin and English
code-switches and calques
Foreign nouns and other non-verbs often occur in their root form. They can be fully inﬂected.
Nouns ending in a consonant can take the linker a, as does beg ‘bag’ in 22.32c, ailand in T1.10,
kar ‘car’; or @, as does ailan ‘island’ in T1.11; or i , as does bus ‘bush’ in T1.21.
The behaviour of verbs in code-switching deserves special mention. A code-switch consisting
of a verb plus its object cannot be inﬂected, and has to occur with a support verb, as in 21.22.
Loan verbs can be treated as parts of complex predicates with support verbs (see examples
in §17.2.2), e.g. stati t@ - ‘start’, pinisi t@ - ‘ﬁnish’, andestand t@ - ‘understand’. Or they can be
inﬂected, as in 22.3, from a speech by an orator at the name debate (8 October 2004). In the
examples, English forms are underlined and Tok Pisin forms are in italics.

The same ‘code-switched’ verb can occur without either inﬂection or support verb, and then
occur inﬂected, within one sentence. Example 22.5, also from the name debate, illustrates this:
22.5 wun aka

This variability in the treatment of code-switches and borrowings is indicative of their uncertain status as marginal—albeit dangerously frequent—insertions into ‘proper’ Manambu.
We will now turn to the issue of the linear position of borrowings and code-switches
in Manambu, and to the question of morphological and syntactic calques from Tok
Pisin.
The position of borrowings and code-switches in a sentence, clause, and noun phrase in
Manambu presents a researcher with a number of puzzles. Moravcsik (1978) suggested that
a grammatical word can only be borrowed if the linear order with respect to its head is
also borrowed—that is, if a preposition is borrowed from language X into language Y, it
has to be borrowed as preposition, even if the language Y has nothing but postpositions.
(Also see Curnow 2001: 430–1 on a potential counterexample from Basque.) Manambu
partly follows Moravcsik’s prediction, and partly goes against it (also see Aikhenvald
forthcoming c).
In agreement with her prediction, borrowed or code-switched conjunctions keep the same
place in Manambu as they have in the source language—Tok Pisin. This is the case with o ‘or’
in T2.50, tasol ‘but’ in T2.3 and 22.7, and sapos ‘if’ in 22.8.

The language-internal motivation behind this is that the few connectives Manambu has
occupy exactly the same position. The same applies to nau ‘then’ which occurs in the same
place in Manambu clauses as it does in the Tok Pisin spoken by the Manambu. This clausechaining insert accompanies the sequencing marker, and nau forms one phonological word
with the verb:
22.9 [Ya-tataka-nau]
ata wa-di
come-imm.seq-then then say-3plbas.p
‘On having come, they then said’
Within a noun phrase, non-agreeing adjectives of Tok Pisin extraction occupy the same place
as they would in Tok Pisin, and in Manambu, as shown in 22.17, and 22.10.
22.10 a
liklik ma:j wa-k@-tua
then little story say-fut-1sgsubj.vt+3fem.sgbas.vt
‘Then I will tell a little story’
A Tok Pisin indeﬁnite pronoun sampela ‘some’ or narapela ‘(an)other’ precedes a Tok
Pisin adjective, as would its Manambu equivalent n@k@- ‘(an)other, some’; it also precedes a
Manambu adjective, as in 22.11:61022 Genetic and Areal Relationships22.11 narapela ma:j wa-k@-tua
sampela kwasa
ma:j
(an)other story say-fut-1sgsubj.vt+3fem.sgbas.vt some
little+fem.sg story
‘I will tell another story, some little story (or other)’
A quantiﬁer planti ‘many’ precedes the noun, just like its Manambu equivalent samasa:m
(see 22.36); and a quantiﬁer olgeta ‘all’ follows the noun, just like Manambu aba:b ‘all’; 22.12b
was the speaker’s correction of his spontaneous code-switch in 22.12a.
22.12a ñan olgeta atawa kwa-na-dian

‘We all stay like this’
22.12b ñan aba:b atawa kwa-na-dian

‘We all stay like this’
In all the instances so far, the linear position of a Tok Pisin item was the same as that of its
Manambu counterpart. Not so for the numerals. We can recall, from §10.6.1, that numerals in
Manambu follow the head noun. In Tok Pisin, they precede it. When Tok Pisin wanpela ‘one, a’
appears in Manambu speech, it precedes the noun, following Moravcsik’s predictions that if a
term is borrowed, so is its linear order. Wanpela is quite frequent (and uniformly condemned as
‘bad language’). It appears with Tok Pisin nouns, as in 22.13–14, and with Manambu nouns, as
in 22.15–16 and 21.42 (where wanpela ta:kw (one:tp woman) is repeated as ta:kw nak (woman
one) ).

with Tok Pisin adjectives than with those from Manambu:

Occasionally, wanpela and nak ‘one’ occur in one noun phrase, reinforcing each other (as
in 21.42). We return to this in § 22.5.4. In all these instances, wanpela has nothing to do with
counting; it is an indeﬁnite introducer for a new referent. A story in Tok Pisin would start with22.4 Inﬂuence of Tok Pisin and of English611wanpela plus a participant—so this use of wanpela in Tok Pisin is an obvious consequence of a
tendency to ‘match genres’ in languages in contact (see Aikhenvald 2006b: 27), that is, sharing
pragmatic patterns and the ways of organizing discourse structures.
Other borrowed numerals do not behave this way. They always precede foreign nouns, as in
T2.21 and T2.40 tu wik ‘two weeks’ (from English). Code-switching in numbers is considered a
mistake—in T2.40 the speaker corrected himself by saying wik (tp, e) viti ‘two weeks’; in T2.41
he used sande viti ‘two weeks’, lit. ‘two Sundays’.
If used with a Manambu noun, Tok Pisin numerals typically follow them, just as a Manambu
numeral would, thus going against Moravcsik’s prediction. These numbers are used for counting, and often occur accompanied by Manambu terms, in ‘parallel’ structures:
22.18 n@k@-di t@n@b
foa faiv a:li taba:b kwa-na-di
other-PL household four ﬁve four ﬁve
stay-act.foc-3plbas.vt
‘Other (clan) households are four (or) ﬁve, four (or) ﬁve’
English and Tok Pisin terms are often used for numbers bigger than ten (as in T2.65)—see
§22.4.3 below, on the motivation for this.
The Tok Pisin preposition and adverb wantaim occurs in Manambu as a postposition, replacing the postposition wuk@n ‘together, with’ (see §4.5, and 4.68–9). The postposition wantaim is
used by younger speakers, and is considered highly substandard. An example spontaneously
produced is in 22.19:
22.19 m@n-a
wantaim yi-k-na-bran
you.masc-lk with
go-fut-act.foc-1dubas.vt
‘We will go together with you; you and I will go together’
Other numerous code-switches involve pro-clauses, e.g. orait ‘OK’ often used similarly to
Manambu ya:kya ‘OK’ (see §20.4.2) (also see T2.50, T2.60, T2.65), em nau ‘this is it’, and em
tasol ‘this is it, just this’. They are not morphologically or syntactically integrated. The question
about whether they can be assigned to a Manambu word class remains open.
As we saw at the end of §4.5, the word class assignment for a number of Tok Pisin inserts is
problematic (this may justify considering them as code-switches rather than borrowings). One
such problematic word is the modal mas ‘must’ (from Tok Pisin mas) which—unlike any other
modal—can occur with an imperative-marked verb as in 13.22. Another one is tabu, from Tok
Pisin tambu, ‘be prohibited’. This form never occurs inﬂected. It can head a predicate, as in
22.20:
g@ñ@r warya-wari tabu
22.20 Apat@pa-wa
Avatip+lk-com later ﬁght-red forbidden
‘Later on it was forbidden to ﬁght with Avatip’
Or it may form one constituent with an inﬂected verb in non-future or in future, in what
superﬁcially looks like a complement clause construction, as in 22.21–2:
22.21 abra-wur
b@yib ñan tabu

‘There is no hitting them, it is forbidden for me to hit (them)’ (lit. I am forbidden I will
hit)
In terms of its synchronic status, tabu forms a subclass of its own.
The Tok Pisin completive marker pinis also behaves in an unusual way when it occurs in
Manambu speech. It can head a predicate (and be modiﬁed by olgeta ‘altogether’, also from
Tok Pisin), as in 22.23, or form a whole clause, as in 22.24 (where it is preceded by a pause):
22.23 ata S@ruali pinis olgeta

If accompanied by an inﬂected verb, as in 22.25, it may be interpreted as an aspect marker: its
position is the same as that of the Tok Pisin pinis.
22.25 vya-da-k
olgeta

hit-3pl-compl.ds altogether compl
‘Having completely killed all . . . ’
Mas, tabu, and pinis may be interpreted as tokens of incipient ‘loan’ morphology in Manambu
(see §4.5.6).
Syntactic and morphological calques from Tok Pisin are diﬃcult to identify because of the
nature of Tok Pisin as a Creole language. Any structural similarity between Tok Pisin and
Manambu may well be due to the indigenous substratum in Tok Pisin itself rather than its
inﬂuence on Manambu. Such similarities include some compounds, e.g. Manambu mæn-ta:b
(leg-hand), Tok Pisin lekhan ‘hands and feet’, the polysemy of Manambu vya- ‘hit, kill’ and
Tok Pisin kilim, and numerous others.
If the Manambu patterns used by frequent code-switchers into Tok Pisin (most, but not
all, of whom are younger than 40–50) diﬀer from those employed by traditional speakers and
display striking structural similarity to Tok Pisin, we can suspect that calquing is at work. For
instance, code-switchers tend to use the postposition wuk@n in many contexts where a comitative would be expected (see §7.9), and even replace it with wantaim (see above). This reﬂects a
tendency towards analytic constructions possibly developed under Tok Pisin inﬂuence. Codeswitchers display more frequent verb-medial order than traditional speakers, which may again
be due to the Tok Pisin inﬂuence (traditional speakers have a pronounced verb-ﬁnal tendency
in their constituent order).
The more Tok Pisin the person uses, the more impoverished their Manambu sounds—such
speakers would prefer series of juxtaposed clauses to clause chains (see Chapters 18–19), and
would rarely use certain clause-chaining markers, such as -taka ‘immediate sequence’. This
takes us to the issue of incipient language obsolescence—taken up in §22.6.1.","[634, 635, 636, 637, 638, 639]"
"9.1.2 Other nominalizations and an adjectivizing derivation
Non-productive action nominalizations involve the syllable-weight-sensitive suﬃx -ka:u ‘action
nominalization’: it requires that the root it combines with should contain at least one light and
one heavy syllable (in the sense of §2.4.2). This suﬃx has been attested with one disyllabic root
kak@l ‘surpass, exceed’; the resulting form kak@l-ka:u (surpass-nom.act) means ‘races, competition’ (as in 9.22). All other roots this suﬃx occurs with consist just of one heavy syllable (of
CVC structure); they have to undergo full reduplication. The resulting forms are g@p-@-g@p-@ka:u (run-lk-run-lk-nom.act) ‘running around’, t@p-@-t@p-@-ka:u (dive-lk-dive-lk-der) ‘diving up and down’, and pakw-@-pakw-@-ka:u (hide(intr)-lk-hide(intr)-lk-nom.act) ‘hiding; hide
and seek’. A possible exception is rali-rali-ka:u (untie-untie-der) ‘game of untying (grass skirt)’,
as in kwa:r rali-rali-ka:u nayi-di (grass.skirt untie-untie-nom.act play-3plbas.p) ‘they playedTable 9.1 Meanings and functions of reduplicated verb root

morpheme. All the -ka:u derivations refer to a kind of game, or process. These nominalizations
cannot take case marking (see 7.14). They are freely used as heads of predicates as in 9.22, and
express unmarked purpose, as in 7.14. With the verb ‘play’ they refer to the game played, as in
9.23.

Unlike any other object it can never be cross-referenced on the verb. In these properties, it is
reminiscent of the nominal component of complex verbs.
The suﬃx -kay derives an object nominalization from one root, yab@r- ‘fan (somebody)’,
producing yabr@kay ‘fan’. Two suﬃxes occurring with one root each derive adverbs: -sap as
in yanu-sap (magic-der) ‘by magic’ (this suﬃx is homophonous with one of the transportative
case markers: §7.7) and -naral as in takwanaral (woman+der) ‘(row or sit in a canoe) in a
woman’s fashion (for a man)’.
The inﬁx -ka- ‘intensive’ accompanied by root reduplication is partly a word class-changing
derivation (see Table 4.2, and §4.3.2). It derives non-agreeing adjectives with intensive meaning
from numerous non-agreeing adjectives, e.g. s@mi ‘long’, s@mi-ka-s@mi ‘very long’. A few nouns
take this inﬁx, and the result is, in many cases, a non-agreeing adjective, e.g. laki ‘ginger’, lakika-laki ‘green; ginger colour’. Some nouns refer to colours when used as modiﬁers, e.g. wa:m
‘white cockatoo; white colour’. When used with the inﬁx -ka-, these are used only as nonagreeing adjectives, e.g. wama-ka-wa:m (white+lk-int-white) ‘very white’. Further examples
are in §4.3.2.
The inﬁx -ka- when applied to nouns does not always derive an adjective: as mentioned in
§4.3.2, this derivation with ya:l ‘stomach’ results in yala-ka-ya:l (stomach+lk-int-stomach)
‘empty stomach’, as in 4.58.9.2 no n-wo r d c la s s -changing derivations
Manambu has a few adverb-speciﬁc derivational suﬃxes (§4.4) and derivational formatives
occurring on personal names (§5.3). Verbal formatives whose status is ambiguous between
derivational suﬃxes and parts of compounds are discussed in §15.2.4.
Manambu has one non-word class-changing derivational suﬃx, a collective marker -ja:y
which applies just to nouns. This suﬃx has a fairly speciﬁc meaning: it deﬁnes a peer group
or a generation-based group of people, e.g. n@b@-takwa-ja:y (marriageable-woman+lk-coll)
‘young marriageable women’, naubadi-ja:y (young.man-coll) ‘young men’, du-a-ñanugw-aja:y (man-lk-children-lk-coll) ‘a peer group of little boys’, takw-a-ñanugw-a-ja:y (womanlk-children-lk-coll) ‘a peer group of little girls’. This suﬃx is also used with kinship terms,
e.g. amay-br@-ja:y (mother-pl-coll) ‘peer group of classiﬁcatory mothers’, asay-br@-ja:y ‘peer
group of classiﬁcatory fathers’, jukwar-ugw@-ja:y ‘peer group of siblings’, ñaju-gwu-ja:y ‘peer
group of paternal uncles’, away-bra-ja:y ‘peer group of maternal uncles’.
To refer to an exclusive group, the suﬃx -ja:y appears inﬁxed in between the reduplicated
parts of a fully reduplicated noun, as in takwa-ja:y-ta:kw (woman+lk-coll-woman) ‘a group9.2 Non-word class-changing derivations187of women only’, ñanugw-a-ja:y-ñanugw ‘a group of children only’, and du-a-ja:y-du (man-lkcoll-man) ‘a group of men only’.
Forms containing this suﬃx have plural reference and require plural agreement. The suﬃx
itself requires a plural form of a noun it occurs with (if the noun has one). If the plural form
of a noun is archaic and restricted in usage, it cannot occur with -ja:y, e.g. tid@-takwa-ja:y
(co.wife+lk-woman+lk-coll) ‘peer group of co-wives’ (i.e. women of the same clan who are
either married to the same man, or are eligible to marry men from the same clan), but neither
∗
tid-igw-ja:y nor ∗ takwagwa-ja:y (though the archaic forms tidi:gw ‘co-wives’ and takwa:gw
‘wives’ exist and occur in songs).
Note that -ja:y- follows the plural marking in the forms above. This may be considered as
an exception to an oft-quoted tendency to place inﬂectional markers (such as plural) after
derivational markers. However, as shown in §6.1, number marking on nouns themselves in
Manambu is highly restricted and quite irregular. It can be argued that plural on nouns is a
derivation, and not an inﬂection.
A collective form marked with -ja:y can modify a personal pronoun, as in 9.24; or occur in
S and in an oblique function, as in 9.25.

A suﬃx of the same segmental form occurs on the command marker jau ‘let it drop’ (Tok
Pisin maski) resulting in the adverb jau-ja:y ‘any old way, carelessly’. It appears impossible to
decide whether the two ja:y are indeed instances of the same aﬃx, or diﬀerent aﬃxes.
The unstressed non-productive derivational suﬃx -kara occurs with yara ‘all right’; the
resulting form is yara-kara ‘well’.
Four further suﬃxes appear to form one morphological system. They can combine with
any word class (that is, they are low in selectivity), displaying somewhat diﬀerent properties
depending on the word class they occur with. Their properties are summarized in Table 9.2.
All these suﬃxes require a linker (see §4.1.1). Third person singular and dual pronouns
require the linker -k@-, just as with case markers. One grammatical word cannot take more
than one of these suﬃxes—this is an argument in favour of them forming one morphological
system. However, they can occur on diﬀerent words within one NP, as shown in 9.34 below
(similarly to the way in which one noun phrase can contain two cases which occur on diﬀerent
words within one noun phrase, as in 7.71, where one is comitative and the other dative). We
discuss them one by one.
1. The suﬃx -d@ka ‘only, just, exactly’ can occur with members of any word class, with the
basic meaning ‘only, just’, e.g. takwa-d@ka t@p (woman+lk-only village) ‘village of women
only’, m@n-a-d@ka (you.masc-lk-only) ‘you only, just you’. A noun marked with -d@ka can
occur in any function. In 9.26, -d@ka occurs on an O and on a deictic adverb ‘like that’. The
suﬃx is pronounced as -da in rapid register (see §2.6).
The suﬃx -d@ka ‘only’ is unstressed. When it is added to a noun or a verb, the stress moves
to the antepenultimate position, e.g. a:s ‘dog’, asá-d@ka t@p (dog+lk-only+lk village) ‘village
of only dogs’.","[211, 212, 213, 214]"
"61622 Genetic and Areal RelationshipsWe saw in Chapter 21 that Manambu abounds in polysemous terms. Tok Pisin helps disambiguate polysemy. We can recall that wuk@- can mean ‘hear, listen, smell, obey, and worry’. By
using a Tok Pisin term wori ‘worry, miss someone’ to replace wuk@- a speaker avoids a potential
misunderstanding.
The same word suku- is used for ‘write, carve, record’—to disambiguate these, one often
says raitim and rikodim, keeping suku- just for ‘carve’. The Manambu word ñ@g means ‘leaf,
mosquito net, paper, letter’—but the Tok Pisin word pas only means ‘letter’, and its use makes
communication more eﬃcient (see 22.6 and 22.37). We can recall, from §21.1.1, that k@- means
‘eat, drink, consume (e.g. smoke)’. Tok Pisin distinguishes kaikai ‘eat’ and dringim ‘drink’—
and some speakers, especially mothers, use these words when urging children to eat or to drink,
to ensure that the distinction is made. Along similar lines, laku means ‘know’ and ‘understand’.
And one frequently hears wun save ma: t@ (I know neg have:neg) ‘I don’t know, I have no
knowledge’ rather than wun laku-n ma: t@ (I know/understand-seq neg have:neg) ‘I don’t
know/understand, I have no knowledge/understanding’. The compound gab@-ma:j refers to
a traditional story (e.g. Texts 1 and 3) and to a teacher; many people choose unambiguous
stori and ticha, to avoid potential confusion.
Traditional Manambu had the same word meaning ‘truth’ and ‘lie’ (sua:l); the two meanings
can be disambiguated with a special construction (see Chapter 21). But it is quicker and easier
to say giaman ‘lie’ (originally from English gammon) and tru ‘true’, or tru stori. And this takes
us to yet another function of Tok Pisin code-switches—that of a ‘shortcut’.
The Manambu speakers themselves often lament that Tok Pisin is a ‘shortcut’—a language
where brukim means ‘break’, no matter what sort of breaking we are talking about, karim
‘carry’ covers all sorts of carrying, and kukim ‘burn’ does not allow one to distinguish diﬀerent
types of ‘burning’. (I heard similar complaints from Gala speakers who plainly stated that Tok
Pisin is not a language at all, only a ‘shortcut’.)
However, the lure of a quick-and-easy shortcut is strong. It is easier to say stori ‘story’ than
to choose an exact term—gabu-ma:j ‘traditional story’, or wa-saki-ma:j ‘true story’ (21.37). A
short term hat ‘hat’ is easier than aba-wapi (head+lk-clothing) (see 21.38). A lengthy ap t@na-d-@ mi (bone/strength ‘stand’/have-act.foc-3masc.sgbas.vt-lk wood) ‘hard wood’ is liable
to be replaced with short strongpela (tp) mi (m), with the same meaning. Same for higher
numerals: we can recall, from §10.6.2, that numbers higher than ten in Manambu are complex
in structure. As a result, Tok Pisin and English numbers are preferred, as an ‘easy’ option (see
T2.65).
Manambu has several ways of saying ‘I am lazy, fed up, unwilling (to do something)’. Body
part constructions s@ p (skin) jina, sakwina (lit. skin is tired) mean ‘I am tired and fed up’
and s@p væt yina (lit. skin goes heavy) means ‘I am very tired, unwell’ (see §21.4). A complex
predicate kwas@k yinawun means ‘I am unwilling (to do something)’ (cf. 13.81). Tok Pisin
has one word, les ‘tired, unwilling, dislike’, which covers all these distinctions. Young people
and children often use les in combination with the functionally unmarked auxiliary yi- ‘go,
say’: one hears les yinawun instead of any of the four combinations above. This construction
has the same syntax as kwas@k yi- (it requires a dative-aversive-marked nominalization, as
in 9.8 and 13.81). The following example comes from a spontaneous conversation: a thirtysomething speaker refused to drink any more water (for fear of having to go down to pee at
night):
22.35 les yi-na-wun

‘I don’t want to drink water (or ‘I am fed up with drinking water’) for fear of urine’22.4 Inﬂuence of Tok Pisin and of English617And using brukim for ‘break’ means that one does not have to be speciﬁc—we can recall
that Manambu has numerous verbs for breaking, but no generic term. This is similar to the
ways in which some speakers use the general verb m@gi- if explicitly asked to avoid excessive
code-switching, as we saw in §21.3.2.
Speakers are aware of the fact that using Tok Pisin involves simpliﬁcation—and this attitude
is indeed reﬂected in how Tok Pisin appears to be used as ‘baby talk’. Along similar lines,
speakers of inﬂectionally complex languages—such as Bilingual Navajo—borrow ‘easy-toprocess’ words from English (Schaengold 2004: 52–7; Aikhenvald 2006b: 34). Using a Tok
Pisin word, or a whole phrase, results in levelling distinctions obligatorily made in Manambu.
A further function of Tok Pisin inserts is getting the point across; this is similar to ‘reiteration’ as one of the functions of code-switching recognized by Gumperz (1982). A frequent
technique here involves parallelism, whereby native and borrowed forms appear together (see
Hajek 2006; Aikhenvald 2006b), as in 21.22, 21.57, 22.9, 22.25, T2.54, and 22.36–7. Such
parallelism may involve repetition of a whole clause, as in 21.22, 21.57, and 21.42, or a noun
phrase, as in 22.36, or a noun, as in 22.37, or just a modiﬁer, as in 22.18.

Such parallelism has additional functions for diﬀerent speakers. Examples 22.36 and 22.37
were produced by relatively young men (around 40) who consider themselves knowledgeable
in the traditional lore. They typically code-switch with Tok Pisin, but are acutely aware of
this ‘deﬁciency’, and insert the Manambu forms whenever they can, as a sort of afterthought.
The parallelism in 22.33 had another additional function: stressing the point, and making the
speech more expressive. Note that the order of Tok Pisin and Manambu parallel forms in 22.37
diﬀers from that in 22.36 and 22.18. Example 13.22 also illustrates such a parallelism: the Tok
Pisin mas ‘must’ is accompanied by the third person command form of the verb ‘know’ (which
already has a deontic meaning of obligation: see §13.2.2). The function is to make sure the
addressee understands the importance of this obligation.
In addition to this, code-switching may be used to stress a particular point (see Hill and Hill
1986: 377). Tok Pisin forms often sound more expressive than their Manambu equivalents.
If someone really approves of something, they are likely to exclaim Nambawan! rather than
Vyakat-a-m@y (good-lk-very) ‘very good’; or tru-al! (true-3fem.sgnom) ‘it is true!’ rather
than m@y-a sual-a ‘it is really a true story!’ During the Saki (name debate) ceremony, such
exclamations were accompanied with an often unanimous sound of appreciation (sounding
like a very loud AAAŰ-111Ů). And a negative Nogat! reﬂects a much stronger rejection than
a simple Manambu ma: or even ka (see 10.24). This diﬀerence in illocutionary force between
Tok Pisin and Manambu can be linked together with the role of Tok Pisin as a ‘power-talk’.
We will see in §22.6 that Manambu is currently threatened by the encroachingly dominant
Tok Pisin and English. As a consequence, many speakers have word retrieval problems. And
this is where Tok Pisin insertions come into play—a Tok Pisin equivalent is the one they61822 Genetic and Areal Relationshipsremember ﬁrst. This is perhaps the saddest function of Tok Pisin, and the one speakers lament
most. For them, mixing Tok Pisin with Manambu results in a ‘rubbish talk’.22.5 new development s i n t he manambu lexicon
Despite extensive code-switching, there is a marked tendency to extend the meanings of Manambu words to refer to newly introduced items and activities. The maintenance of these items
is ensured by language purists (see §22.6) concerned with the survival of Manambu, and those
speakers who prefer to avoid ‘rubbish talk’—Manambu peppered with Tok Pisin inserts. In
public places outside the Manambu-speaking villages, many of these words serve the function
of ‘secret talk’—everyone would understand mani (Tok Pisin for ‘money’), but hardly anyone
would make any sense of kabak (lit. ‘stone’) or sa:n (lit. shell valuable). 4
For instance, a riﬂe is called jarkañ (a term for bamboo shoot originally used as a storing
tube), and jarkañ l@-k@ væy (bamboo.tube 3fem.sg-poss+3fem.sg spear, lit.‘bamboo tube’s little
spear’) is the word for ‘bullet’. A term for a long piece of bamboo kañgu is used to refer to a
policeman (by reference to policemen carrying a long bamboo-like riﬂe on their shoulder).
The word kabak ‘stone’ is used to refer to large sums of money, and sa:n ‘shell valuable’ is
used to refer to money (any quantity). The word j @l@g ‘ten shell valuables strung together’
is used for a ten-kina note. Kabas@k ‘seed’ now means ‘rice’, t@k-@-mi (seed/little.fruit-lktree) ‘seed, little fruit of a tree’ is a term for ‘medicine’; wali-na:gw (white.man-sago) refers
to ‘biscuit’, and wali-gus (white.man-paddle) means ‘outboard motor’. Few people say kar for
‘car’—most prefer val ‘canoe’, and hardly anyone says umbrella—aba-ñ@g (head+lk-leaf) is
used instead. The term for a plane is mi val (high canoe); though many do switch to balus,
a Tok Pisin term. Telefon is in competition with mi ma:j (high talk). The term j @b ‘design,
drawing’ is also used for ‘letter, literacy’; its major competitor is English letter. And the
term taba-ñ@ (hand+lk-sun) is used in the meaning of ‘watch’ more than the English word
watch.
Some new developments in the Manambu lexicon result in creating further patterns of
polysemy. An example of a newly evolving polysemy is kayik ‘image, picture, reﬂection (in
water), shadow, ghost’ (see §21.4), and nowadays also ‘photographs, pictures’ and ‘ﬁlms’.
(Examples 16.107 and 19.20 illustrate kayik in the sense of ‘photographs’.) A noun phrase
kayik v@-bana tami: (image see-1plsubj.vt+3fem.sgbas.vt area) can be understood as ‘area
where we see ﬁlms’, and ‘area where we see ghosts’. This is, of course, easy to disambiguate in
a context of real life. Another option, as we saw above, is to use a Tok Pisin or an English word
instead—neither ﬁlm nor piksa evoke any implications of ‘ghosts’.
The noun ñ@g ‘leaf, mosquito net’, also used for ‘letter’ (but hardly ever for ‘book’), presents
a similar problem. We saw in 22.6 and 22.37 that it is in stiﬀ competition with Tok Pisin pas.
As mentioned above, suku- means ‘carve, write, record (on a tape-recorder)’. This polysemy
posed unexpected problems for a ﬁeldworker as well as for the speakers, since it does not
allow one to easily distinguish between ‘writing’ and transcribing a story, and ‘recording it’.
The only way out appears to be a Tok Pisin code-switch (see §22.4.2 above). Another new
pattern of polysemy involves the verb v@- ‘see, look’ in the meaning of ‘read’ (see 21.13a, b). It
is diﬃcult to distinguish between ‘look at a book’ (as a child or an illiterate person would do),
and ‘read a book’—so Tok Pisin ridim ‘read’ comes to the rescue.
4 This category also includes terms for people from areas of Papua New Guinea other than the Sepik area, e.g.
m@g-a lap (unripe-lk banana) for the Tolai, and bal (pig) for Highlanders.","[642, 643, 644, 645]"
"22.4 Inﬂuence of Tok Pisin and of English615‘Power-talk’ is not the only function of Tok Pisin: it can be used as a sort of baby talk. All
the children address their mothers and fathers in Tok Pisin (see mama as in 22.31). A speaker
lovingly said to her little niece: sindaun na kaikai ‘sit and eat’. This is also reﬂected in frequent
parallel Manambu–Tok Pisin structures, as shown in 22.33. Here, the mother was trying to
placate a crying baby, and said the same thing twice—in Manambu and in Tok Pisin:
22.33 yata-u
mama i
karim yu
carry-1sgimpv mama pred carry you
‘Shall I carry you? Shall Mummy carry you?’
In 22.34, another mother was trying to convince her baby to go and wash hands together
with her other children:
22.34 yi-nak
mipela i
was han
go-1plimpv we
pred wash hand
‘Let’s go, we wash hands’
Speakers have an explanation for this function of Tok Pisin, saying that it is easier than
Manambu for small children. And indeed, the fact is that most children acquire Tok Pisin ﬁrst.
Little Joana (about 3 in 2004) was quite good at Tok Pisin, and did not speak any Manambu
at all. And no wonder: her carers talked to her almost exclusively in Tok Pisin. Her mother
was not concerned about this in the slightest, saying, on various occasions, ‘she will speak, (in)
the village language together with the white people’s language’ (cf. 4.73). We return to this in
§22.6.2.
Some relatives are always addressed with a Manambu term; then this is like a personal name,
and there is no code-switching. The child addressed in 22.28 always calls this grandmother yæy
(‘paternal grandmother’). This explains why the mother used this term within the noun phrase
containing a Tok Pisin code-switch.
In summary: the major function of code-switching between Tok Pisin, English, and Manambu is asserting one’s authority—that is, both Tok Pisin and English are used as ‘power-talk’;
nowadays, English is rapidly monopolizing this function. At the same time, Tok Pisin (but not
English) plays a special role in language socialization: it is considered ‘easier’ than Manambu
and is employed as a ‘baby talk’.
Another function of Tok Pisin is filling a perceived gap in the language. Manambu
does not have a dedicated contrast marker, so tasol comes in as in 22.7 and T2.3. A similar
explanation would hold for the introduction of sapos ‘if’ in 22.8 (Manambu has a fairly
elaborate system of conditionals, but not a word for ‘if’), and for the disjunction o (as in T2.50).
There is no special word for ‘everything’—no wonder an exasperated mother exclaimed about
her baby daughter trying to grab everything: everﬁng kur@-k! (everything get-purp.ss) ‘She is
going to grab everything!’
Similar examples abound for lexical items. Filling a lexical gap accounts for the use of
mas ‘must’, tabu ‘forbidden’, and the verb laik ‘like’. The concepts of ‘liking’ and ‘wanting’
can be expressed through using the desiderative modality, a speech report construction, a
complex predicate with the form m@yakw kwa-, or a body part construction with the noun
mawul ‘insides’. But each of these constructions is rather complex, and fraught with additional
overtones. Most speakers ﬁnd it easier to say wun laiki-na-wun ‘I like’ or wun ma: laik (I neg
like) ‘I don’t like’ rather than wun ma: wa-na-wun (I neg say-pres-1sgbas) ‘I am saying no’. Note
that the latter form is in fact ambiguous between ‘I don’t want’, ‘I don’t like’ and ‘I refuse’ (to
say ‘no’ to). Here, the introduction of Tok Pisin results in a resolution of potential ambiguity.
And this takes us to the next point.","[641, 642]"

Grammatical Relations
Understanding grammatical relations in Manambu is pivotal for understanding its grammar.
A member of any major word class can head an intransitive predicate, or be a modiﬁer in an
NP. A verb as head of either transitive or intransitive predicate takes tense- and topicalitysensitive verbal cross-referencing suﬃxes, to mark subject (A/S) and non-subject. In contrast,
if a member of most other classes is head in an intransitive predicate, it takes person-marking
enclitics (§3.1). Grammatical relations are also marked by cases on nouns, on subject-nonsubject basis (§3.2), and through a set of demonstratives, on an absolutive basis (§3.3).3.1 c ro s s -referencing
Nouns, adjectives, adverbs, verbs, and most closed subclasses (see Chapter 10) can head an
intransitive predicate. Only a verb can be head of a transitive predicate. In the indicative mood,
all Manambu verbs can cross-reference one or two arguments. One of these has to be the
subject—A or S. A non-subject argument can also be cross-referenced if it is more topical than
the subject, independently of the verb’s transitivity.
This is how it works. In 3.1, the S=A ambitransitive verb ‘know’ is used intransitively. The
suﬃx -na- ‘action focus’ indicates that the focus is on the fact of knowing, and not on what
is known. The subject (S), ‘I’, is cross-referenced on the verb. The cross-referencing suﬃxes
employed are in Table 3.1.
3.1 b@
laku-na-wun
already know/understand-act.foc-1fem.sgbas.vt
‘I know (already), I am knowledgeable’
This same verb can be used transitively, with an object. The object in 3.2 is not topical—
that is, it is not something to be further deployed in the discourse. The subject (A) is the only
participant cross-referenced on the verb:
3.2 (wun) a
yar@k b@
laku-na-wun
I
dem.dist+fem.sg news already know/understand-act.foc-1fem.sgbas.vt
‘I already know that news’
If a constituent other than the subject is more topical than the subject, both are crossreferenced on the verb. In 3.3–4 the object is topical, and it is cross-referenced in the second
position on the verb, with the same markers as the ones used for the S/A in 3.1–2 (Table 3.1).
The subject is also cross-referenced, but with a diﬀerent set of markers (Table 3.2). Person
marking on the verb can occur together with a full NP. Since the NP is optional, it is in
parentheses.
3.3 (d@ wun-a:m) laku-da-wun
he i-lk+obj know-3masc.sgsubj.vt-1fem.sgbas.vt

ma:j wun) laku-tua-d
dem.dist-masc.sg story I
know-1sgsubj.vt-3masc.sgbas.vt
‘I have understood it (e.g. a long story)’
An oblique can be cross-referenced on the verb, if topical. The destination, ‘road’, is the
topic of 3.5, and is cross-referenced in the second position on the intransitive verb ‘go’. The
road is in the allative case (§7.5).
3.5 (wun) a-d@
yaba:r
yi-tua-d
I
dem.dist-masc.sg road+lk+all go-1sgsubj.vt-3masc.sgbas.vt
‘I went towards that road’ (that we are talking about)
The choice of an argument or an oblique to be cross-referenced on a verb depends on the
topicality of this argument (or oblique), and also on the verb’s semantics. Out of context,
3.6 could be understood as ‘I ﬁnished that work (we were talking about)’ (then, the object
‘work’ would be cross-referenced), or as ‘I ﬁnished that work at that (topical) time’ (then,
‘time’ would be cross-referenced), or as ‘I ﬁnished that work in that (topical) way’ (then
‘way, manner’, of feminine gender (§5.2.1), would be cross-referenced). The cross-referenced
constituent can be overtly expressed, but does not have to, inasmuch as it is retrievable from the
context:
3.6 a
yawi kus@-tu@-l
dem.dist+fem.sg work ﬁnish-1sgsubj.p-3fem.sgbas.p
‘I ﬁnished that work (we were talking about)’
‘I ﬁnished that work at that (topical) time’
‘I ﬁnished that work in that (topical) way’
Example 3.7 also has two meanings—diﬀerentiated only by the context.
3.7 ñap-a-ta:kw
Dora kui-la-b@r
mother’s.sister-lk-woman Dora give.to.third.p-3fem.sgsubj.vt-3dubas.vt
‘Aunt Dora gave (us) these two (Malay apples)’
‘Aunt Dora gave (Malay apples) to the two (girls)’
Topical constituents which can be cross-referenced in the second position include time,
location, destination, and manner. The following can never be cross-referenced:
(a) A copula complement—see 3.8 and 3.9. The copula subject is always cross-referenced;
the second position can be occupied by location, manner or time.
3.8 a-b@r

(b) The second argument of verbs of ‘becoming’ or ‘turning into’:
patiaku-l

‘She has then already turned into a cassowary’3.1 Cross-referencing63(c) Nominal components of complex verbs (§7.2), e.g. gu ‘water’ in gu yaku- ‘wash in water,
bathe’; m@l ‘eye’ in m@l v@- (eye see) ‘see with eyes’; or wapruku- ‘be overfull’, as 3.11.
Here, ‘house’ (of masculine gender) is the subject:

wapruku-d
3du-obl-masc.sg house all

‘Their whole house was overﬂowing with money’
(d) A constituent marked with a transportative, substitutive, or comitative case—see
§§7.7–9.
(e) A speech report—see §19.5.
Ellipsis of noun phrases, frequent in speech, makes the exact reference of cross-referenced
participants highly context dependent. Statistically, some participants tend to be crossreferenced more often than others. For instance, the addressee of the verb wa- ‘say’ is more
often cross-referenced than the message. This has to do with the fact that wa- is frequently
used to frame direct speech reports which can never be cross-referenced. A form wa-k@-tua-di
(say-fut-1sgsubj.vt-3plbas.vt) can mean ‘I will tell (something) to them’, or ‘I will tell them,
e.g. stories’, depending on the context.
A form kur-m@na-d@wun (do/make-2sgsubj.vt-1masc.sgbas.vt) is more likely to mean ‘you
did (something) to me’, than ‘you created or made me’, if the story from which this example
comes is not a creation myth. With the verb ‘give’, the overall frequency of cross-referencing
either the ‘recipient’ or the ‘gift’ is the same (this goes against the frequently discussed preference, among the languages of the world, to mark the recipient rather than the ‘gift’ of
‘give’).
In contrast to verbs, non-verbal predicates cross-reference just the subject, with crossreferencing enclitics listed in Table 3.4.
Table 3.1 features the ‘basic’ set of cross-referencing markers used for
(i) the subject, if no other, more topical, constituent is to be cross-referenced—as in 3.1–2;
(ii) the more topical constituent other than the subject—as in 3.3–5.
In situation (ii), the subject is cross-referenced with a special set of cross-referencing suﬃxes
as listed in Table 3.2. A marker from this set is always followed by a marker from the ‘basic’ set.
The relevant verbal cross-referencing sets distinguish what we call ‘versatile tense’ (employed
for present, recent past, and in future contexts—see §12.2). The tense distinction is neutralized
in dual and plural of the basic set. The non-tense-sensitive suﬃxes in the subject set are the
ones used in partially inﬂected verbal forms (where only the subject is expressed: see §11.1.1).
The two sets of personal markers are similar, but not identical. The versatile tense basic set
diﬀers from its past counterpart only in the feminine singular forms. The versatile tense subject
markers diﬀer from their past tense counterpart in the quality of the ﬁnal vowel in all the forms
except for ﬁrst and third person plural where the present–recent past set has an extra syllable
-na.
The basic sets diﬀer from the subject sets in ﬁrst person (all numbers). The subject set has no
gender distinctions in ﬁrst person. The basic sets are easily segmentable: they contain gendernumber markers -d- ‘masculine’, -l/ø- ‘feminine’ in the singular, and number markers -b@r ‘dual’ and -di- ‘plural’, in dual and plural forms respectively.
All other forms are similar to personal pronouns featured in Table 3.3. The basic set shows
more similarities with the personal pronouns than the subject set. The ﬁrst person markers in
the subject sets are not related to the personal pronouns at all.","[87, 88, 89, 90]"
"54220 Clause Types and Discourse-Pragmatic DevicesWe saw, at §20.1.3 above, that the interrogative pronoun s@ ‘who’ is obligatorily marked for
focus if it occurs in subject function. This is the only instance of grammaticalized focus whose
occurrence is limited to S and A.
Highlighting focus constructions involving arguments and obliques cannot be negated separately. This is hardly surprising: we can recall that a constituent cannot be negated separately,
without the whole clause being negated.
We now turn to a rather unusual construction whose function is to contrast an action, or
a state, to other actions or states. Such ‘predicate focus’ constructions involve marking a fully
inﬂected verb as if it were a non-verbal predicate. Note that they cannot involve a predicate
already marked for action focus (§12.2). (If the predicate in ‘predicate focus’ contains an
uninﬂected verb, it requires a support verb—see §17.2.) In 20.87, the speaker is saying that
what they were going to do was to cut the pig, and not anything else. This is framed as predicate
focus—that is, the whole clause is within the scope of the focus. A similar example is at 11.8.
20.87 [au {k@-d@
bal ra-k@-bana-l}-a]
then dem.prox-masc.sg pig cut-fut-1plsubj.vt-3fem.sgbas.vt-3fem.sgnom
‘It is that {we are going to cut the pig}’ (rather than doing something else)
‘Predicate focus’ structures produced spontaneously often provide an explanation for an
unusual event or state. When we returned to Avatip from an exhausting trip to Swakap, people
would look askance at my bandaged arms. The answer—provided by Yuaneng—was:
20.88 [{Swakapa:r
yi-ba-l}-a]
Swakap+lk+all go-1plsubj.p-3fem.sgbas.p-3fem.sgnom
‘It is that {we went to Swakap}’ (and got sunburnt and tired)
A distal demonstrative as head of non-verbal predicate can be put in a focus construction,
as a form of a strong statement: a-l-al (dem.dist.fem.sg-3fem.sgnom-3fem.sgnom) ‘this is it’.
It is also used as a conversation sustainer, and as a summarizing statement indicating that the
speaker has ﬁnished one point, and may well start on something else.
Such predicate focus constructions cannot contain reactivated topic demonstratives. Neither
do they occur with a non-predicate-ﬁnal constituent order. This is to do with their pragmatic
organization: the event or the resulting state is viewed as a whole, and is thus contrasted to
another event, the participants being of secondary importance.
The diﬀerence between the English translational equivalents in 20.87–8 and 11.8 and the
Manambu structures is that there is no overt subordination marker in Manambu.
If the predicate in a highlighting focus construction is negated, it takes the subordinate
negator -ma:r-. We can recall, from §14.5.3, that this is indeed the most frequent context under
which a predicate of what looks like an independent clause may occur with -ma:r-. This involves
focusing a negated clause. Examples are at 14.134–5, and 20.89a. What makes life in Swakap
unbearable for the people from Avatip and Malu is that:
20.89a [{kwasa
wi
t@-ma:r-dana-l}-a]
small+fem.sg house have-neg.sub-3plsubj.vt-3fem.sgbas.vt-3fem.sgnom
‘It is that {they do not have toilet (small house)}’
This brings us back to the issue of whether highlighting focus involves a cleft or not. In
many languages, focus constructions are expressed via cleft clauses which, in their turn, involve
marking part of a clause as a dependent clause. That a dependent clause negator is used
in focused clauses shows that such clauses may be considered underlyingly dependent. That
is, at least predicate focus constructions may be considered clefted, but the evidence only20.4 Further issues in discourse organization543becomes apparent if they are negated. And this should not come as a surpise—it is also the
case in relative and juxtaposed dependent clauses whose status as dependent clauses is fully
revealed under negation. Highlighting focus constructions do not involve relative clauses (see
§19.2): the rearrangement of participants typical for possessor relative clauses does not occur
in highlighting focus constructions.
If a constituent in highlighting focus is contrastive, an option is to employ double focus. This
involves adding another nominal cross-referencing marker, as in 20.89b. Here, the fact that they
do not have a toilet is contrasted to the fact that other, more ‘cultured’ people do:
20.89b [{kwasa
wi
small+fem.sg house
t@-ma:r-dana-l}-a]-al
have-neg.sub-3plsubj.vt-3fem.sgbas.vt-3fem.sgnom-3fem.sgnom
‘It is that {they do not really have toilet (small house)}’
The existence of double focus structures demonstrates that focus constructions are diﬀerent
from verbless clauses with non-verbal predicate heads: no non-verbal predicate would take
double cross-referencing, outside the focus construction. Unlike 20.60, where a double focus
structure is obligatory, in 20.89b it is pragmatically determined.
Are highlighting focus constructions monoclausal or biclausal? The evidence goes both
ways. A noun phrase in highlighting focus has the appearance of a full verbless clause, since
it includes non-verbal cross-referencing markers. On the other hand, it is not a full clause
because it cannot be negated separately. It occupies the argument slot of the predicate. And
if it is to be questioned, the question word also has to be cast as a focused constituent.
We conclude that highlighting focus constructions combine features of biclausal and monoclausal constructions, and, just like transitivity-neutralizing constructions involving clause
chaining (§17.5), are an additional instance of grammar-in-the-making. A similar construction
in Iatmul was described by Jendraschek (2006b): their status as bi- or monoclausal is equally
ambiguous.20.4 f u rt h e r i s s u e s i n d i s c o u r s e o rga n i zat i o n
Manambu clauses form sentences which contain one main clause, and sentences combine to
form a paragraph. A paragraph—or a coherent stretch of discourse—is deﬁned as having a
topic of its own, and is normally separated from the next paragraph by a signiﬁcant pause.
As we saw above, a topic usually appears preposed to the predicate. A reactivated topic—
that is, a topic mentioned in a previous stretch of discourse and known to the speaker
and to the addressee, but not mentioned for some time—is marked with reactivated topic
demonstratives (see §10.2.3 and §3.3). This is a powerful device which allows speakers to
handle more than one topic at a time. The ways sentences can be linked together within a
paragraph, or across paragraphs, are addressed in §20.4.1. In §20.4.2 we discuss the function
of ‘boundary-marking’ clauses consisting of ya:kya ‘all right’ and its Tok Pisin equivalent orait
(§20.4.2).
We saw in §20.2 above that constituent order plays its role in identiﬁcation of topical participants. Narratives tend to be elaborate in stating participants, while conversational discourse
is highly elliptical, and heavily relies on context. Some of the recurrent principles of ellipsis in
the Manambu discourse are discussed in §20.4.3.","[568, 569, 570]"
"4.2.2 Semantically and grammatically determined subclasses of verbs
Verbs fall into several transitivity classes—see A below. Polyfunctional verbs are a special
subclass—see B. The verb ‘give’ forms a class on its own—see C. A small class of weather
verbs is discussed under D, and complex verbs consisting of a verbal root and a non-verbal
component are under E.
A few other verbs display unusual grammatical and semantic features. These include
ingestive verbs k@- ‘consume (eat, drink, smoke)’ and j @- ‘chew’; verbs of speech; generic
verbs; and verbs of perception. These are discussed in §§21.1–3. Verbs can be classiﬁed
with respect to how they combine with directional markers—see §16.1.1. Further, minor4.2 Verbs79properties of various semantic subclasses of verbs will be discussed throughout the grammar as
appropriate.
A. In terms of Transitivity Classes, Manambu has strictly intransitive, transitive, and ditransitive verbs. Strictly intransitive verbs include motion verbs, e.g. yi- ‘go’, ya- ‘come’, g@ p- ‘run’,
tabu- ‘escape’, posture verbs, e.g. kwa- ‘stay’, r @- ‘sit’, and a few others, such as gra- ‘cry’,
warsam(a)- ‘be angry’, and kawi- ‘come ashore’.
Over 80 per cent of verbs are S=A ambitransitives, e.g. laku- ‘know, understand’, used
intransitively in 3.1 and transitively in 3.2; other such verbs include k@- ‘consume (food, drink,
smoke)’, j @- ‘chew’, and wuk@- ‘hear, understand’. A few verbs can be used only transitively,
e.g. yi- ‘say, speak’ and kur- ‘do, make, get’.
As shown in §3.1, an O can be either unmarked for case, or marked with the accusativelocative -(V)m. The direct object of verbs with somewhat negative overtones takes the dative
marking. This agrees with one of the meanings of the dative case as a ‘maleﬁciary’ marker
(§7.4). For instance, the S=A ambitransitive verb yaga- ‘be scared’ takes the O in dative case,
e.g. kaykak yaga-na (ghost+dat be.scared-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt) ‘she is scared of a ghost’.
In its meaning ‘be worried about someone’, the polysemous verb wuk@- ‘hear, obey, feel, worry’
takes the object in dative, as in 4.11 and 21.19.
4.11 d@-k@-k
wuk@-na-wun
3masc.sg-obl-dat worry-act.foc-1fem.sgbas.vt
‘I am worried about him’
The verb ‘see’ is unusual in the case marking for its O constituent. It is unmarked if the object
seen is indeﬁnite or not completely seen. If the verb has an atelic meaning, ‘see’ (by chance),
the object is in the dative case, as in the ﬁrst line of 4.12. And it is marked with the accusativelocative if the object is fully seen and the action is telic, rather than atelic—that is, if the verb
v@- means ‘look’, as in the second line of 4.12. (The accusative-locative case marks the object
of this verb in its newly acquired meaning ‘read’: see §21.1.2.)

Strictly transitive and ambitransitive verbs diﬀer from intransitive verbs in their derivational
possibilities. Intransitive verbs can form causative compounds with the verb taka- ‘put’ as V2
(see §15.3.1 on its applicative-like meaning). The preﬁx kay- (limited in productivity) derives a
strictly transitive verb from an intransitive verb, e.g. wiy- ‘be broken’, kay-wiy- ‘break by hand,
e.g. nuts’. If used with an ambitransitive verb, kay- has a diﬀerent eﬀect—for instance, it may
imply a special eﬀort or an unusually large object, e.g. tapu- ‘hold, carry’, kay-tapu- ‘hold, carry
(an unusually large bundle)’ (see §16.2). Most verbs derived with the preﬁx kay-, or causatives
with wa- ‘say’ as V1 are strictly transitive, e.g. kay-napwi- ‘unwrap (e.g. a parcel)’, kay-puti‘take oﬀ’ (see §15.3.2 and §16.2.1 for further discussion).
Verbs of speech, perception, and giving, and most intransitive verbs (e.g. ‘die’ or ‘stand up’),
diﬀer from other verbs in terms of (a) whether they combine with directional markers at all,
and (b) what the semantic eﬀects are—see §16.1.
Verbs which are both S=A and S=O ambitransitives include all the generic verbs (§§21.1–3),
t@ p- ‘close’, kaykwa- ‘spill something intentionally (transitive); capsize (intransitive)’, wuka‘drop or spill unintentionally; fall’, wula- ‘enter; make enter’, s@luku- ‘forget something; be
forgotten’, gwaj- ‘turn (the handle); turn (by itself)’, rali- ‘untie something; untie (by itself)’,
kus@- ‘ﬁnish’ (4.13–14).","[105, 106]"
"764 Word ClassesAddress terms can be gender sensitive; for instance yab@n, yaban is a term of address for men
of the Maliau clan, and yab@nay is its correspondent for women. The form yab@nay is also a
name for the Iatmul clans which are totemically the same as the Maliau clan; this term has no
other meaning in Manambu. The same address term can be used for men and for women: for
instance, tapwuk ‘chicken’, gawi ‘eagle’, and wud@b ‘spirit’ can be used to address both men
and women from the Nabul clan.
Address forms are illustrated in 4.5–6. In 4.5 a cassowary (who has shed her skin and become
a beautiful young woman) is addressed in the way appropriate for a member of the Sarak clan,
to which she belongs, since the cassowary is its totem. This is said by a man who has just stolen
and hidden her skin, and is going to marry the cassowary-woman.

In 4.6, two diﬀerent address forms are used to one person. The more address forms one
knows and uses, the more elaborate one is as a speaker, and the addressee is likelier to listen to
what one has to say.

The address forms such as the ones shown in 4.5–6 can be used as vocatives. They can also
be heads of intransitive predicates and copula complements: to say that someone is of the
Vali:k clan, one can say: kanukaraki-a (death.adder-3fem.sgnom) ‘she is (to be addressed as)
“death adder” (a totem of the Vali:k clan)’. They are not used in any other function, and can
be considered a marginal subclass of nominals, restricted in their morphological and syntactic
possibilities.
The general ‘goodwill’ address term k@ p, plural k@pugw ‘my dear’ stands apart from all
other address terms. It is used exclusively as a term of address in farewells, greetings, and
expressions of best wishes, and is noun-like only in the way the plural is derived (see §6.1). It
can be considered a defective noun (see §21.2.2). (Since it cannot be modiﬁed, or used as an
argument, its gender is impossible to establish: see §5.2.)
Deverbal action nominalizations are derived via CV/CCV and CVCV reduplication of the
verbal root (the choice depends on the root structure; further discussion of nominalizations,
their argument structure and meanings is in §§9.1.1–2). They can occur in the S function, as in
4.7 (‘be diﬃcult’) and 4.8 (‘ﬁnish’).

They are used as complementation strategies—see §19.8. Unlike other nouns, but just like
verbs, nominalizations can be modiﬁed by nouns in local cases, e.g. t@p-a kudir nas-@-nas
(village-lk language+all count-lk-count) ‘counting in the village language’, but not by adjectives. A nominalization can modify a noun, e.g. tabu-tabu wa:l (escape-red rain) ‘a passing
rain, lit. a rain running away’. Nominalizations do not take any verbal morphology.
A subclass of nominals can occur only as copula complements, e.g. bwiyabwi ‘heat’ (copula
na-) and suan ‘diﬃculty’ (copula yi-). These also include terms for weather and times of day,
e.g. kat@lam ‘dawn’, and onomatopoeia, e.g. rou rou rou ‘growling sound’ (both occur with the
copula na-). Unlike other nouns (except for the address term k@ p) the gender of these nominals
is impossible to establish, since they cannot be heads of NPs or arguments other than copula
complements.
They cannot take any nominal (or other) morphological markers. Just a few can be used as
modiﬁers. For instance, the form s@pis@pi ‘drizzle, drizzly’ typically occurs with a copula na-,
as in s@pis@pi na-k-na (drizzle be:nat-fut-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt) ‘it will drizzle’. It can also
be used as a modiﬁer to the only noun with which it is semantically compatible: s@pis@pi wa:l
(drizzle rain) ‘drizzling rain’, and as a modiﬁer to a verb, as in wa:l s@pis@pi væker-na (rain
drizzle fall-act.foc+3fem.sgbas) ‘the rain is falling in a drizzly way’.
This is a potentially open class, since it comprises loans like bisi ‘busy’, isi ‘easy’, stati ‘start’,
save ‘know, knowledge’ (from Tok Pisin bisi, isi, stati, and save) or les ‘lazy, unwilling’ (from
Tok Pisin les). These always occur as copula complements, with a copula/support verb yior t@- (see §17.2.2), e.g. stati t@-na-wun (start ‘stand’-act.foc-1sgbas.vt) ‘I start’, ma: save
t@ (neg know ‘stand’:neg) ‘(I/you/she/he, etc.) don’t know’, and 22.35. They never occur as
verbs, despite the fact that, as we will see in §4.2, Manambu is not averse to borrowing
verbs.
Nouns of physical states are similar: they typically occur as copula complements, with
polyfunctional verbs (see §4.2.2 and §17.2), e.g. ka:m ‘hunger’ (copula yasa-/yas@-), n@k@r ‘cold’
(copula tay-). However, most of them can also take the dative case, be heads of possessive constructions, and occur with derivational suﬃxes, e.g. sad@ka (sleep+only) ‘(process of sleeping)
only’. A few can occur with more than one polyfunctional verb with a meaning diﬀerence, e.g.
s@ ‘sleep’ with the copula yasa-/yas@- means ‘be sleepy’, and with the copula kwa- means ‘sleep,
be asleep’. These nouns can be assigned variable gender depending on the ‘degree’ of quality
they express (masculine gender goes with a stronger degree, and feminine gender with a weaker
degree—see §5.2).
A number of deverbal aspectual forms (e.g. -j@b@r ‘customary aspect’: §12.7) and modal
forms (e.g. desiderative -k@r (§13.5) and frustrative -p and -(ya)k@ p (§13.6) ) appear to be more
nominal than verbal. First, they do not take any verbal cross-referencing or verbal sequencing
suﬃxes. Secondly, to express tense, or to be used in a non-main clause, these forms have to
occur as complements of the support verb t@- ‘be, stand’, as illustrated in 4.9.

syntactic function other than a copula complement. Since they express essentially verbal
categories and have verbal argument structure, we will consider them in the chapters dealing
with verbal morphology (Chapters 11–13).4.2 v e r b s
4.2.1 Verbal grammatical categories
Verbs are an open class. They constitute the most complicated part of the Manambu grammar,
from the point of view of both the richness of grammatical categories, and of morphophonological complexity. That verbs are an open class is corroborated by the facility Manambu
appears to have in adopting verbs as loans. We saw in §4.1.2 that verb roots are often borrowed
as nominals, and then used as copula complements. Verbal roots can also be borrowed as
verbs, and then take all the appropriate verbal morphology. It is hard to determine whether
these are established loans, or occasional nonce loans, e.g. a-pas (impv-tie) ‘tie!’, pasi-tua ‘I
tied’ (from Tok Pisin pasim ‘tie’), a-tik (impv-tick) ‘tick!’ Whether to borrow a verb as a
verb, or as a nominal employed as a copula complement of the verb t@-, is often speaker’s
choice (see Aikhenvald forthcoming c). The Tok Pisin verb kamap ‘take place, occur, get up’
is frequently used as a full verb in Manambu, e.g. kamap@-d ‘he got up, (it) happened’. The
same root can be borrowed as a copula complement of the verb t@-, as in kamap@ ta:d (get.up
‘stand’+3masc.sgbas.vt) ‘He got up (became ﬁne)’. Loan verbs integrated into the language
and used by most speakers include sali- ‘send’ (Tok Pisin salim), laiki- ‘like’ (Tok Pisin laikim),
puti- ‘put’ (Tok Pisin putim), paini- ‘ﬁnd’ (Tok Pisin painim), and lukauti- ‘look after’ (Tok
Pisin lukautim) (despite the attempts of the proponents of ‘pure’ Manambu to get rid of
them).
Verbal categories include personal cross-referencing, action focus, tense, aspect (Chapter 12),
moods and modalities (Chapter 13), and verbal negation (Chapter 14). Verb compounding is
employed for valency increase, and to express an array of aspectual and directional meanings—
see Chapter 15. Verbs take a set of directional aﬃxes (see §16.1). A non-productive transitivizing preﬁx derives a morphological causative (see §16.2). Verbs—unlike any other word
classes—can occur in the predicate slot of subordinate clauses (without requiring a support
verb: see Chapters 18 and 19). Verbs fall into at least ﬁve classes depending on root type and
vowel alternations in non-stressed syllables within the verbal paradigm. These are discussed in
§11.3.","[102, 103, 104, 105]"
"55621 Issues in Semantics and Features of LexiconUnlike in, say, Indo-European languages such as English (also see an overview in Evans and
Wilkins 2000), ‘see’ does not cover the meanings of ‘know’ or ‘understand’ (these are expressed
with laku- ‘know, understand’, and partly with wuk@- —see below).
In its meaning ‘try’, v@- typically describes trying something by taste or touch. The manner
of ‘trying’ is speciﬁed with a sequencing -n form of a verb, as in 21.8:
21.8 ka:n
v@-tua
eat+seq see/try-1sgsubj.vt+3fem.sgbas.vt
‘I am trying (the new food) by eating’
An imperative of v@-, ap, can mean ‘look!’ or ‘try!’ As is typical for imperatives, it has to have
a telic and volitional meaning—that is, ap does not mean ∗ ‘see!’ or ∗ ‘experience!’ However, a
permissive form remains polysemous—21.9 has both meanings ‘may I see/may I look’ and ‘may
I try’. It does not mean ‘may I experience’, because ‘experiencing’ denoted by v@- is beyond
asking for permission—this is something that just happens no matter what.
21.9 vau
see/try+1sgimpv
‘May I see/look’; ‘may I try?’
To avoid the ambiguity, one can use a verb compounding construction involving the bound
root -k@ta ‘try’ (discussed under A3 in §15.3.1; see 15.40). Forms with the bound root -k@ta
have no imperative.
21.10a [k@-k@ta-n] [vau]
eat-try-seq see/try+1sgimpv
‘May I try and eat’ (lit. try by eating)
∗
May I see and eat
Yet another alternative is a biclausal construction with a sequencing -n:
21.10b [ka:n] [vau]
eat+seq see/try+1sgimpv
‘May I try by eating’
∗
May I see and eat
If the verb v@- is used in such a biclausal construction and is marked with -n, the resulting
meaning is ‘try and see, try and look’, and not ∗ ‘see looking’:
21.11 [væn]
[ap]
see/try+seq impv+see/try
‘Try and see, try and look’
If the verb v@- appears with a completive medial clause as its clausal complement in O
function (see §19.8), it can only mean ‘see’, as in T2.4, T3.20, T3.48, and 21.12.
21.12 [waku-d@-k]
[v@-l@-d]
go.out-3masc.sg-compl.ds see-3fem.sgsubj.p-3masc.sgbas.p
‘She saw that he went out’
∗
She tried for him to go out
We saw in §16.1.1 that the form -k@ta- takes the directional markers to provide directional
speciﬁcations for v@- ‘see/look’. Since directionals make the verb telic (see §16.1.3), the translation ‘look’, and not ‘see’, is the only one appropriate for v@- with a directional (see 14.95, 16.7,21.1 Verb semantics55716.55, and 19.89). The directional forms of verbs of perception, ‘see/look’ and ‘hear/listen’,
indicate the direction of the gaze or listening. The directional suppletive forms of ‘look’ are
used adverbially, as modiﬁers, but never as verb roots. This is how ‘look’ diﬀers from all other
intrinsically directional verbs (see Table 16.2). If used with a directional, the verb v@- cannot
mean ‘try’, e.g. k@tu v@- (look.up see/look-) can only mean ‘look upwards’, and not ∗ ‘try and
look upwards’.
A recent extension of the verb v@- is ‘read’. The accusative-locative often marks the object of
‘see’ in this meaning, but does not have to (see §7.3):
21.13a a
l@-a:b
buk ma: v@,
d@-k@-d@ka v@-d@-l
then she-too book neg see+neg he-obl-only see-3masc.sgsubj.p-3fem.sgbas.p
‘She did not read the book, only he read it’
21.13b buka:m
v@-na
book+lk+acc/loc see-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt
‘She is reading a (speciﬁc) book’
We can also recall, from §17.4, that a formally unmarked body part m@l ‘eye’ can be used in
a body part construction with the verb v@-. Its eﬀect is to stress the perceptual meaning ‘see;
look’, as in 17.65 and 21.14. In 17.65 a child is instructed to look properly at what she is doing,
and in 21.14 the speaker was recounting her own experience:
21.14 k@tab@k-a
ja:p m@l v@-tua
this.way+pred+like-lk thing eye see-1sgsubj.vt+3fem.sgbas.vt
‘I saw this kind of thing with my (own) eye’
We saw in §7.3 that occasionally m@l ‘eye’ can take accusative-locative case if seeing with
‘one’s own eyes’ is focused, as in k@p-a m@la:m v@-k-na-ñ@n (own-lk eye+lk+loc see-futact.foc-2fem.sgbas.vt) ‘you will see (the Swakap people and their ways) with your own eyes
(as opposed to hearing about them)’. (No such examples have been attested for ‘ear’ with
‘hear’—see below.)
It was seen in §4.5 that the form kuk@- ‘back’ appears in a few modiﬁer-noun compounds,
including a partially predictable one kuk@-m@l, in kuk@-m@l v@- (back-eye see) meaning ‘look
back’ (see §4.5.2). If repeated, it can be used ironically to describe someone looking over and
admiring themselves, as in 21.15. This is how Kerryanne was supposed to react to a traditional
Papua New Guinea style female dress ‘meriblaus’ which I was instructed to buy for her:
21.15 kuk@-m@l kuk@-m@l v@-k-na
back-eye back-eye see/look-fut-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt
‘She will look at herself admiringly’ (lit. eye to the back eye to the back she will see)
The body part does not aﬀect the verb’s transitivity: the object can be understood from the
context, as in 21.15, or it can be overtly stated, as in 21.16:
21.16 k@p m@l v@-tua-d
kara:b
just eye see-1sgsubj.vt-3masc.sgbas.p men’s.house
‘It is that I saw the man’s house with my (own) eyes’
The verb v@- appears in a number of formations which marginally involve vision as a
means of perception, e.g. v@-s@m@l- (see-?-) ‘look for’, v@-s@m@l-s@m@l- ‘look for something very
carefully’ (see §15.3.1), v@-k@ka-n t@- (see-?-seq have-) ‘look after’ (15.27), and v@-v@-ka- (seesee-‘move’?-) in v@-v@-ka-taka- (see-see-?-put-) ‘watch carefully’ (15.28). An additional irregular55821 Issues in Semantics and Features of Lexiconform v@-v@-ka- means ‘see, watch’ in the following lexicalized complex predicate. A synonymous
expression is given in 20.17b:
21.17a m@l v@-v@-kan
kwa-na
eye see-red-?+seq stay-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt
‘She is watching (us talking) (not doing anything else)’
21.17b m@l væn
kwa-na
eye see+seq stay-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt
‘She is watching (us talking) (not doing anything else)’
In none of these cases can the verb v@- accompanied by m@l have the meaning of ‘try’ or
‘experience’. In just one instance does v@- combine with a directional form of the verb kar-/kra‘carry, bring’: v@-kraki- (see-carry.across-) means ‘recognize by seeing’. It also combines with
-sapwi- ‘open’, meaning v@-sapwi- (see-open-) ‘discover by seeing something’ (see below on
wuk@-sapwi- ‘discover by hearing’).","[582, 583, 584, 585]"
"Cognates of the Manambu feminine singular -l are attested in Iatmul l1 ‘she; 3fem.sg agreement marker’, Hanga Kundi lé ‘personal pronoun; subject agreement suﬃx’ (Wendel 1993: 59),
Ambulas lé ‘she’, and Boiken (Yangoru) l@ (Laycock 1965). Also see Appendix 22.1.
A ø-marked feminine could be a Manambu-Gala innovation, cf. Gala a ‘third person
singular feminine bound pronoun’ (Laycock 1965: 133), and third person feminine singular
free pronoun ki ‘she’ as opposed to third person masculine singular k@l, k@r ‘he’.
Cognates to the Manambu second person masculine pronoun and agreement marker m@n
are found throughout the family. And so are the cognates to the Manambu second person
feminine ñ@n. The only partial exception to this pattern is found in Gala—see Table 22.1.
Personal pronouns in Manambu are added for comparison (repeated from Table 3.3).
A striking feature of this paradigm is the gender distinction in ﬁrst person. The Proto-Ndu
∗
ñ@n(@) ‘second person singular feminine’ was reinterpreted as ﬁrst person singular feminine,
and yin co-opted as second person feminine. The form yin is cognate with the second person
feminine yine in Boiken (Freudenburg 1979; also see Aikhenvald forthcoming b). The third
person pronoun contains the stem k@- cognate to the Ndu proximate demonstrative (e.g.
Manambu k@-). The third person feminine form is formally less marked than the masculine
form k@r/k@l. The latter contains the masculine marker -l which is a regular correspondent of
Proto-Ndu ∗ d, as in Manambu du versus Gala lu ‘man’.
Manambu also shares a considerable amount of nominal, and of verbal, lexicon with other
Ndu languages. Structural and formal similarities between Manambu and Iatmul may have
been enhanced by constant contact (see below, §22.3, on the loans from Iatmul). A number
of innovations are shared with the Abelam-Wosera group. We can recall, from §4.2.2, that
Manambu shares the formal distinction and the marking of ‘give to third person’ and ‘give
to non-third person’ with Abelam-Wosera. This distinction is absent from all other Ndu
languages, and is not reconstructible for Proto-Ndu.
Historically, Manambu must have undergone a strong diﬀusional impact from non-Ndu
sources (such as Kwoma—see §22.2.3). This may explain why it is morphologically more complex than most other Ndu languages. For instance, Manambu has more case forms, modalities,
directionals, and negators than any other Ndu language. At the same time, certain morphemes22.1 Manambu as a Ndu language
non-singular
plural marker on kinship terms(C)593dual 3rd person/2nd person (A;B)associative plural(D)Chart 22.1 Putative semantic development of the polysemous morpheme -b@r in Manambufound in other Ndu languages have been lost in Manambu. We saw in §21.1.1 that the cognate
of a nominalizing suﬃx -va:k, highly productive in Iatmul as a word class-changing device, and
as a complementation strategy, survives in Manambu in just one formation: k@-k@-pa:t (eat-eatder) ‘raw food’ (see 20.58 and 20.65). Synchronically, this form is no longer segmentable.
Manambu underwent a number of phonological processes and mergers. We saw in §4.1.1
that Manambu lost the ﬁnal vowels of Proto-Ndu disyllabic nouns whose ﬁnal syllable ends
in a stop. In each case, the lost vowel surfaces as the linker when a noun occurs with a case
marker, or as a modiﬁer (cf. takwa:k ‘to woman’, ñ@ga:k ‘to leaf’, etc.). Some of the forms
Manambu shares with the unrelated Kwoma maintain the ﬁnal vowel in at least one Kwoma
dialect (Bangwis, documented by Bowden 1997: see §22.2.3). This may indicate that the early
Kwoma–Manambu contact pre-dated the Manambu ﬁnal vowel loss.
A number of Proto-Ndu distinctions in word-ﬁnal stops are neutralized in Manambu. Not
surprisingly, this has created numerous homonymous morphemes. Consider the suﬃx -b@r ,
which has four meanings in Manambu:
(A) second person dual basic and subject cross-referencing marker (see Chapter 3);
(B) third person dual number agreement marker on agreeing modiﬁers (see Chapter 5) and
in verbal basic and subject cross-referencing paradigms (see Chapter 3);
(C) plural marker on a limited number of kinship terms (see §6.1); and
(D) marker of associative non-singular with personal names only (see §6.1).
Synchronically speaking, this can be described as an instance of polysemy of a marker with a
general meaning of ‘non-singular’. An inventive analyst could invoke the widespread polysemy
of second and third person dual marking in New Guinea languages (and elsewhere)—this
would account for a link between (A) and (B).
Non-singular marking on a personal name often has an associative reading, as it does in
English (e.g. The Smiths, understood as ‘Smith and his associates’, rather than ?’many Smiths’:
see Moravcsik 2003). And it is well known that nouns with high animate and human referents
are more likely to be overtly marked for plural than nouns of other groups (see Smith-Stark
1974; Stebbins 1997; and Aikhenvald 2000). That is, (C) and (D) are also connected.
One can thus establish the semantic chain of Manambu-internal development for a putative
‘non-singular’ suﬃx -b@r as in Chart 22.1.
However, cognates with other Ndu languages tell us a diﬀerent story. The four synchronically
distinguishable morphemes (A–D) with the phonological shape -b@r go back to three distinct
markers:
(A) b@r ‘2du’ goes back to Proto-Ndu ∗ b@n(e) ‘second person dual’ (cf. Wosera beni, Abelam
béné, Gala ben (Table 22.1 above) (also see Laycock 1965: 152); Iatmul b1t (Staalsen n.d.b), bi’k
(Jendraschek, p.c.), Boiken ple (Freudenburg 1979)) (just as Manambu gwur ‘2pl’ corresponds
to Wosera, Abelam guni, guné, Gala gun, Iatmul guk, Boiken kle, from Proto-Ndu ∗ gun(e)).
(These correspondences are regular—see Aikhenvald forthcoming b.)
(B) -b@r ‘3du; dual agreement marker’ goes back to Proto-Ndu ∗ b@d (cf. Abelam bét, Wosera
ber (also see Laycock 1965: 152), Gala b@l; Iatmul b1t (Staalsen and Staalsen 1973), b1k59422 Genetic and Areal Relationships(Jendraschek, p.c.), Boiken ple). The second–third person syncretism in dual forms is found
in Iatmul, Manambu, and also in Boiken.
The morpheme ∗ b@n(e) ‘second person dual’ could be further analysed into ∗ -b@- ‘dual’ and
∗
-n(e) ‘second person’. Along similar lines, ∗ gun(e) ‘second person plural’ could be analysed
as ∗ -gu- ‘plural’ and ∗ -n(e) ‘second person’. The morpheme -gu ‘plural’ is found in restricted
contexts, in Manambu -Vgw (see §6.1), and also in Wosera -(n)gu, Abelam -gu (Wilson 1980:
46), where it is restricted to kinship nouns.
This analysis presupposes that number marking is followed by person marking. This is
indeed the case in Ndu, as can be seen from Manambu cross-referencing markers -d@-wun
(-masc.sg-1sg) ‘ﬁrst person singular basic set versatile tense’, or -di-gwur (-pl-2pl) ‘second
person plural basic set versatile tense’ (see further forms in Chapter 3). The morpheme ∗ -b@d
‘third person dual’ can be analysed as consisting of ∗ -be ‘dual’ and -∗ d ‘third person’.
(C) -b@r ‘plural marker with kin terms’ goes back to Proto-Ndu ∗ -bere, attested in Abelam
-béré ‘pluralizer’ (Wilson 1980: 36). This marker also survives in irregular plural marker -mbri
in West Wosera (Wendel 1993: 57–8: all examples are with kin terms).
It is likely to have developed an additional meaning (D), that of associative plural, when
used with personal names. The development of a reﬂex of ∗ -bere into a marker of associative
plural is attested in Abelam (Wilson 1980: 36). This is analogous to the way Manambu marks
associative non-singular with -b@r (and also consistent with typologically well-attested patterns
of development of associative plural: Moravcsik 2003). In addition, this illustrates another
shared innovation of both Manambu and Ambulas-Wosera.
This is an example of how the existing cognates can help trace the linguistic history of
several markers, and disentangle the problem of polysemy and homonymy in Manambu from a
historical perspective. In other cases, we are less lucky. The form ata in Manambu corresponds
to ﬁve morphemes:
(i) question word ‘how?’ (near-synonyms: ata ata, at@ta)—see §10.4;
(ii) manner adverbial demonstrative ‘thus’ used for textual anaphora and cataphora, with
a near-synonym atawa—see §10.2.2;
(iii) a marker introducing a speech report—see §19.5;
(iv) connective ‘then, and then’—see §19.6; and
(v) negator for purposives and desideratives—see §14.3.2.
Meanings (ii)–(iv) can be linked together: in these three instances the marker ata can be
seen as having a general sequential marker which acquires a special overtone when used in
diﬀerent constructions. However, ata can be in predicative focus (and then take the predicative
marker -n) only when used as (ii) and (iv)—this may be indicative of synchronically diﬀerent
form–function correlations.
When used as a manner adverbial demonstrative, ata appears to contain the distal demonstrative a- and is in paradigmatic opposition to similar adverbial formations containing the
proximal demonstrative k@- (see Table 10.6). This is indicative of the special status of ata in its
meaning (ii).
Whether ata ‘how’ (meaning (i) ) and ata ‘thus’ (meaning (ii) ) are connected or not is an open
question: a link between a manner interrogative and a manner demonstrative is tempting, but
hard to prove.
And ﬁnally, can a plausible connection between functions (i)–(iv) and function (v) be established? Perhaps it can if a typologist allows their imagination to run wild. But this is hardly
scientiﬁc. Unfortunately, comparative evidence from other Ndu languages provides little help.","[619, 620, 621]"

ﬁrst time, I was warned: wuk@l, diyak (careful, shit+lk+dat) ‘be careful, (beware) of (dog’s)
shit!’ We will see, in F that the second argument of the verb yaga- ‘be afraid of’ takes dative
case.
E. Bodily states and desires are marked with dative case. We saw in §4.2.2 that the verb t@preceded by a body part or a body state noun in dative case refers to something wrong with this
particular body part, e.g. aba:k t@- (head+lk+dat be, stand, have) means ‘be not quite right in
one’s head’; and kam@k t@- ‘be hungry’, as in 7.44. The verb kwa- ‘stay’ is used in a similar way,
as in 7.75.

‘When they are hungry, how will they eat (sago)?’
By itself, kam@k (for hunger), is easily understood as ‘(he/she/they) is/are hungry’. The
verb ‘say’ accompanied by a noun with an inanimate referent in dative case is interpreted as
‘wanting’ (see §19.5, on speech reports), or intention, as in 7.45a.

A headless possessive in dative case can have a similar meaning. A little boy desperately
wanted to get hold of his brother’s bow and arrow. This was phrased as:
7.45b [wun-a-br@k] wa:d

the verbs yaga- ‘fear’, bas s@- ‘ask’, kap@- ‘wait’, sa:l yi- ‘be short of something’, warsama- ‘be
cross at someone/something’, suguya- ‘help’, kal@pa- ‘teach’, and a few others:

The object of wuk@- ‘hear, worry about’ in the meaning of ‘worry about, be sad about’ is
marked with dative case—see 4.11. The objects of verbs of liking—including m@yakw kwa‘like’ and its equivalent, a Tok Pisin borrowing laiki- (in 7.47b), a complex verb mawul war(inside go.up-) in 7.47c, and mawul kur- (inside get) in 7.71—are marked with dative.
The polyfunctional verb yasa-/yas@- ‘be of physical state’ (see Table 4.1) can occasionally
occur with its copula complement in dative case. 7.47a–c are used as synonyms:
kamnagw@-k yasa-na-d@m@n
7.47a agw-a

7.47c agw-a
which-lk food+lk-dat inside go.up-act.foc-2masc.sgbas.vt
‘What food would you like?’
The dative case also marks theme for verbs of speech—that is, what the talk is about, as in 7.48.

‘Village people talk about you’
The dative case marker -Vk occurs on a few adverbs (see §4.4). The etymologically dative form
of the distal demonstrative a/al, al@k, means ‘this is why, for this reason’. We will see in §18.7
that this form has grammaticalized as a causal marker -l@k ‘because of’ on the verb.7.5 a l lat i v e a n d i n s t ru m e n ta l c a s e s
The same form, -Vr, has two diﬀerent meanings and functions—allative (‘towards’) and instrumental. 1 In 7.49 ‘direction’ of motion marked by allative is contrasted to location marked by
locative.

We saw under B in §7.3 above that locative can also mark direction with an implication that the
destination was fully reached, and also that the whole location was involved. Allative has no
such implications (see 7.31, in contrast to 7.32, with a locative-marked constituent). Allative
1-r in the allative-instrumental is often subject to the process of rhotic dissimilation detailed in A1 in §2.6.","[180, 181, 182]"
"844 Word ClassesThe choice between t@- and r @- as existential verbs is partly determined by the nature of
the copula subject. Similarly to many languages of Papua New Guinea (see Aikhenvald 2000:
166–9 for an overview), the verb t@- ‘stand’ is used with referents which are prototypically
vertical—humans, spirits, animate beings, and trees. The verb r @- ‘sit’ is used with large, squat,
inanimate referents, such as ‘pan’ in 4.19. This is reminiscent of classiﬁcatory verbs—see §17.2.3
for arguments against the analysis of Manambu copula as purely classiﬁcatory. The verb t@can optionally replace r @- as an existential. Both t@- and r @- have one suppletive imperative
ada.
The copula r@- ‘sit’ can take the adjective yara ‘well’ as its copula complement, e.g. yara r@na-wun ‘I am ﬁne’; as well as a number of nouns marked with the locative case, e.g. stua-m r@(store-loc sit) ‘be for sale in a store’ (see §17.2.3).
3. The copula kwa- ‘stay’ is used with some adjectives and nouns as copula complement, e.g.
yara ‘well’, as in 4.20, an answer to a conventional question ‘are you ﬁne’? The use of kwa- as
an auxiliary is discussed in §17.2.1; its use in lexicalized complex verbs is addressed in §17.3.
4.20 yara kwa-na-wun
well stay-act.foc-1fem.sgbas.vt
‘I am ﬁne’
4. The copula yi- occurs with a few abstract nouns, such as suan ‘diﬃcult’ in 4.7 and 13.80,
and some onomatopoeic-like expressions, e.g. kr@sakr@s (scratchy) in 4.21. Similarly to the
polyfunctional verbs discussed so far, yi- can be interpreted as a support verb as well as an
existential copula. Unlike the verbs under 6–10 below, yi-can also be used as an open-class
verb.
4.21 wun-a kwa:l kr@sakr@s yi-na
I-lk throat ‘scratchy’ be-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt
‘My throat is scratchy’
This same verb is used with the nominal s@kul@k ‘cooking’ to mean ‘cook’. This construction
can be used without a second argument (‘do the cooking’) or with a second argument (‘cook
something’). However, just as with the verb t@- in the meaning ‘have’, this second argument is
not an object: it cannot be cross-referenced or referred to with the reactivated topic demonstrative.
The verb yi- in combination with kwas@k (possibly, a dative case form of the adjective kwasa
‘small’) means ‘be unwilling to do something, or be tired of someone or something’ (kwas@k
can be replaced by Tok Pisin les, as in 22.35). It takes an additional, non-O, NP argument in
the dative case, as in 4.22. Or it can occur with a postposed irrealis complement clause, as in
13.81. This behaviour is somewhat unusual in Manambu (where the matrix verb tends to be
sentence ﬁnal: see §20.2 on discourse motivations for the constituent order).
4.22 l@-k@-k
kwas@k yi-na-wun
3fem.sg-obl-dat unwilling be-act.foc-1fem.sgbas.vt
‘I am fed up with her’
The copula yi- has the same form as the intransitive verb yi- ‘go’ and the transitive verb yi‘say, speak’ (see §21.1.3 on the syntactic diﬀerences between speech verbs in Manambu). These
three verbs share all forms, except the imperative: as we will see in §13.1, the verb ‘go’ has a
suppletive imperative ma:y, while the verb ‘say’ and the copula share a regular imperative a-y.
Given that, cross-linguistically, the verb ‘say’ often becomes a copula, we hypothesize that the4.2 Verbs85two could be linked in Manambu. The component yi- as V1 in a few compound verbs (§15.2.3),
e.g. yi-pa:kw- ‘hide something’ (where pa:kw- means ‘be hidden’), is also likely to be connected
to the verb ‘say’.
5. The verb kur- occurs as a copula verb in the meaning of ‘become fully, reach, arrive to be
something’, as in 4.23. Its copula complement is always a noun.
4.23 du-a-ñan
ata kur@-d
man-lk-child then become.fully-3masc.sgbas.p
‘He then reached the stage of being a boy’
This verb is also used as a transitive lexical verb meaning ‘do, make, get, take, procure’, e.g.
yawi kur- (work do-) ‘work, do a job’. With a same-subject purposive lexical verb, it forms an
imminent construction, ‘be about to’ (§17.1.2), as in kiya-k kur- (die-purp.ss do/get-) ‘be about
to die’.
As mentioned above, the remaining ﬁve verbs are inherently ambiguous in their status: they
can be equally well interpreted either as existential verbs, or as support verbs each used with a
limited number of nominals. For each of these, the ‘experiencer’ can be optionally added; this
is why it is in brackets. Without the overt subject, 4.24 means ‘it is hot’ (in general); 4.25 means
‘it is cold’ (in general), and examples at 4.26 refer to an unspeciﬁed experiencer (also see §17.2).
6. The copula or support verb na- takes physical states, natural phenomena, ideophones, and
expressives as its complements (also see 4.81).
4.24 (wun) bwiyabwi na-na

cold be:clim-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt
‘It is cold’, ‘I am cold’
8. The copula or support verb yas@-/yasa- occurs with nouns referring to physical states and
desires. These include ka:m ‘hunger’, gu ‘water’, and kwa:l ‘neck’ (Yuanab dialect) meaning
‘feel thirsty’, s@ ‘sleep’, wus ‘urine’, di ‘shit’, and ñiki ‘blood’ (for ‘feeling reckless’).

III. Reason, cause, and purpose are expressed as direct speech reports. Example 19.71 did not
involve any speech acts. This was an answer to a child’s question about why her mother had
gone out:

And 16.81 explains the intentions of 9-month-old baby who could not yet talk.
We saw, at §16.2.2, that speech reports are one of the biclausal causative strategies; examples
are at 16.84, 13.24–5, and T2.34.
IV. Apprehensives can be expressed as direct speech reports. In 19.72 a speech report with an
apprehensive meaning contains an irrealis form meaning ‘might’ (see §13.3):

‘So they were afraid, men too, lest the dogs might hit them (lit. having said “Those dogs
might hit us” )’
V. The end result of counting is usually expressed as direct speech report, as in 19.73 and
T2.21. Neither of these contains an actual speech report: the child we were talking about in
19.73 did not speak Manambu and was too shy to speak in the presence of a white woman
anyway.
19.73 nabi a:li wa:d
year four say+3masc.sgbas.vt/p
‘He is 4’ (lit. ‘he says four’)
We have seen that speech reports do not have to imply a speech act. However, there are two
major diﬀerences between speech reports which do not imply an actual speech act and those
reports that do.
First, a direct speech report can precede or follow the reporting verb (as we saw in §19.5.1
above) only if the actual speaking took place. If a speech report is used to express any of
the meanings detailed in I–V in this section, it always has to precede the verb ‘say’. Reported
commands as indirect speech reports also have to precede the verb of speech.
Secondly, speech reports which do not imply an actual speech act tend not to be introduced
by a speech introducer ata ‘then’ (see Aikhenvald 2008).
An additional way of making clear that a speech act has actually taken place is by using a
‘framing’ construction illustrated in 19.51. Then, if a speech report follows the framing clause,
another framing clause is often added at the end of the speech report of the kind ‘they said
[Speech Report] having said’. A typical example is at 19.74:19.6 Clause linking involving connectives49319.74 [wa:l ja-k-na-d]

then say+3masc.sgbas.p no
rain neg say-compl:ss
‘ “It will rain”, I said saying, then he said, “No, it won’t rain”, having said’
A speech report which does not imply a speech act cannot be used in such a ‘framing’
construction. Neither can the verb wa- in any of its ditransitive or transitive usages without
a direct speech report; nor if it is used in one of the lexicalized collocations, such as ma: wa‘refuse, reject’ or ya:kya wa- ‘agree’.
Framing constructions are very frequent. They also appear in speech reports in the local
Tok Pisin: one frequently hears a dialogue being reported using a quote frame na em i tok
olsem na em i tok (and he said thus and he said). This apparent redundancy serves a purpose:
it distinguishes speech acts as speech acts from their metaphorical extensions.19.6 c lause linking involving connectives
Connectives involved in linking clauses occupy clause-initial position. Connectives do not
occur in any of the medial clauses discussed in Chapter 18, or dependent clauses in this chapter.
The connective a-l@-k ‘because; this is why’ is an exception: it can occur in a causal clause (as in
19.75). This connective derives from that-fem.sg-DAT ‘for that’ and is employed only if explicit
statement of reason is appropriate:
19.75 [l@ wuk@mar-la]

ma:j]
say-1sgsubj.vt+3fem.sgbas.vt dem.dist+fem.sg story
‘She forgot (it), this is why I am telling it again, the story’
A similar example is at 4.16. Alternatively, the connective al@k can be used within a causal
clause, as in 19.76. This is an explanation as to why there is no men’s road and women’s road
in Malu village.

In T1.16 al@k occurs after the subject wun ‘I’, since the subject is fronted as part of a topicalization strategy (see §20.2). This connective can link sentences as well as clauses as in 18.25,
and T1.22. It often occurs in a main clause preceded by a medial causal clause, as in 18.49 and
19.77, or by another medial clause, as in 18.52.

their etymology: both come from a dative-marked feminine form of the functionally unmarked
distal demonstrative a-.
We saw in §18.3 that the medial clause form t@-ku (stand-compl.ss) operates almost like a
conjunction ‘thus, and so’ when it follows another medial clause (see 18.28). This form is indeed
in the process of grammaticalization as part of a conjunction: al@k t@-ku (dem.dist.fem.sg+dat
stand-compl.ss) is used as a clause linker meaning ‘and so, as a result’. It is pronounced as one
phonological word. This connective does not occur with causal clauses. An example is in 19.78:
19.78 [sana:k

this.is.why be-compl.ss neg have.neg
‘They (the neighbouring group) gave away the things from men’s house for money, this
is why they do not have (them anymore)’
The connective aw ‘and then; so; but’ links clauses and sentences. Its meaning may involve
contrast, as in 19.79:
wun ñan ma: t@],
[a-d@-r@b
19.79 [vyak@ta-d],

look.after-1duimpv
‘He (the foundling) is nice, and (surprise, surprise: unlike any normal woman) I don’t
have a child, (so) let’s look right after this one’
It occurs as a sentence linker in T2.5–6, and T2.8–9. Also see 19.72 for its sequential
meaning. When repeated, it refers to alternating actions, as in aw yi-n aw ya-n (and.then
go-seq and.then come-seq) ‘on the one hand coming, on the other hand going’ (T3.18). A
similar example, aw war-@n aw da-n (then go.up-seq then go.down-seq) ‘alternately going up
and coming down’ is in T2.8. This same form can link noun phrases, e.g. aw kami: aw lau-lap
(then ﬁsh then ripe-banana) ‘(we eat) sometimes ﬁsh sometimes banana’ (or both).
The connective a ‘then, as a result’ has a sequential meaning, as in T2.3 and 19.4. It can link
dependent clauses, as in T3.18 where it is similar to aw. It may have an adversative meaning,
roughly translatable as ‘but’, as in 10.22b. The form a probably comes from the feminine distal
demonstrative ‘that’.
Connectives which link sentences within a paragraph are ata ‘then’, and atawata:y (from ata
wa-ta:y ‘then say-cotemp’) ‘and so then, in summary, this is why’. The latter is a result of a
recent grammaticalization of ata and a medial clause form of ‘say’. The semantic development
is congruent with the use of wa- ‘say’ to express reason (see §19.5.6). The connective atawata:y is
often used without reference to an actual speech act, as in 18.33 where the speaker talks about
how the Avatip people lived during the Second World War when they had to hide from the
Japanese invaders. Or it may refer cataphorically or anaphorically to an actual speech report,
as in 19.80:

‘Thus/this way they lied to him about women (lit. put woman-lie to him), “You will
marry a woman, we will give you a young woman”, thus they said to him’
The connective ata often introduces speech reports which imply actual speech, as can be
seen throughout the texts at the end of this grammar. It typically precedes the verb and never
occurs on the ﬁrst sentence in a text (see examples 4.12 and T1.1, T1.8, T1.10, and T1.12). In
the third clause of T1.12 the connective ata is placed after the imperative verb ‘go’; this adds
to the urgency of the command.
Ata can intervene between parts of numerous multiword constituents involving verbs (for
instance, complex predicates: see §17.1–5, and negative constructions: see Chapter 14).
The question of whether the form ata meaning ‘how; thus’ and ata as a negator of desiderative and same-subject purposive (see §14.3.2) are related to each other and to the connective
ata remains open. Several instances of ata in its diﬀerent meanings do not occur; we can recall,
from §10.4, that a repeated form ata ata has just the interrogative meaning ‘how?’
When used in the predicate slot or as part of predicate focus, ata ‘connective’ and ata ‘thus,
how’ take the predicate marker -n (see §10.2.3 on its occurrence with reactivated topic-marking
demonstratives), as in 4.79 and 10.103. No other connective can be focused or head a predicate.
The connective k@pa:b ‘in case’ introduces dependent conditional clauses discussed at §13.7
and §18.8 (examples 13.88, and 18.52). This connective is most probably a terminative case form
of k@ p ‘just’ (§21.2.2). Just like any other connective, k@pa:b occupies a clause-initial position.19.7 j u xta p o s i t i o n o f m a i n c laus e s
Several main clauses can be juxtaposed to one another. Such juxtaposed main clauses do
not have a special rising intonation contour characteristic of dependent juxtaposed clauses
discussed at §19.1. There is usually a short pause between the clauses. Juxtaposition of clauses
has the following semantic eﬀects.
I. A subsequent clause oﬀers a comment or a clariﬁcation to the preceding clause, elaborating
on it. Examples include 19.79, and also 19.9, 19.29, 14.11, 14.12, 14.53, 14.95, 14.97, 14.104, and
T1.9, T1.19–20, T1.22, and T1.28. A similar example is at 19.81: Kuk@lyabau was explaining
that she was a little girl when the Second World War broke out. The fourth clause provides
additional information to the third clause.

rhetorical device, to make sure the hearer understands the point made. Similar examples come
from beginnings and endings of stories—this can be seen in T1.35, T2.68, and T3.1.
II. A subsequent clause oﬀers an alternative, or a correction, to the preceding clause, as in
14.102 and 14.105. If the subsequent clause is cast in irrealis (see §13.3), it acquires an apprehensive meaning—that is, is understood as a warning against something negative. Examples
are at 13.43 and 19.82.

A juxtaposed irrealis clause can be negated with the dependent negator -ma:r-, as shown
in 19.83 (the meaning is that of possible negative consequence). This is unlike irrealis in main
clauses which is negated with the particle ak@s (see §14.3.1); also see 13.35. This suggests that
juxtaposed irrealis clauses could well be treated as a subtype of dependent clauses.

III. If one of the clauses is negated, the relationship between juxtaposed clauses is that of
contrast, as in 14.41, 14.135, and 14.156. Juxtaposition of a positive and a negative clause can
be used as a means of clausal disjunction, as in 7.23.
IV. The subsequent clause marks consequence or reason if it contains an imperative or a
desiderative, as in 13.12, 13.20, 13.23–4, 13.58, 14.31, 14.90, 14.108, and 19.48. Both clauses
can contain either an imperative or a desiderative, as in 19.84.

‘Bring the pot inside (the house), (because) I want to cook’
V. A clause juxtaposed to another clause has a simultaneous temporal meaning if the verb
cross-references time in the second position. This is the case in 19.81 (second clause: ‘(time
when) the war came’) and 9.33. This illustrates the anaphoric or cataphoric function of crossreferencing time in the second position on the verb, which acts as an additional clause-linking
device.
VI. Juxtaposition of clauses may also reﬂect a sequence of actions, as in T1.27. Juxtaposition
of two clauses with positional verbs has a similar eﬀect, e.g. 19.85:

in clause juxtaposition, with just one exception: if juxtaposition of clauses reﬂects a sequence
of actions the subjects are always shared.19.8 c o m p l e m e n tat i o n s t rat e g i e s
Manambu has no complement clauses as a separate clause type. Existing clause types are
used in lieu of complement clauses depending on verb type, the semantics of complement
clause (whether fact or activity, or potential), and the relative tense of the complement clause
(see Dixon 2006, for the basic principles for a typological approach to complementation). A
clausal complement can be in S or O function (but never in A function). These correlations are
summarized in Table 19.4.
We discuss the existing complementation strategies one by one.
I. Completive medial clauses (discussed at §18.3) are used as clausal complements exclusively
in O function, with the verbs of perception such as ‘see/look’ and ‘hear/listen/obey’ (and
compounds and directional forms involving these: see Chapters 15 and 16). They indicate that
the action of the clausal complement precedes that of the main clause. The semantics of clausal
complement is activity or fact. If the subject of the main clause and of the clausal complement
are diﬀerent, diﬀerent subject forms are employed. Examples are at 19.86–7; also see T2.4,
T3.20, and T3.48.

II. Juxtaposition of main clauses (also see §19.7) is used for a clausal complement in O function with the same verbs of perception. Juxtaposition is used if the action of the complement
is either simultaneous or subsequent to the main clause—in contrast to the completive medial
clauses in I above. Examples of simultaneous action are at 19.48, 19.88–9, 19.93a–b, 19.94, and
also T1.11 and T3.16.

If the action of the clausal complement is subsequent to that of the main clause, it can be
cast in future tense, as in 19.90. Such constructions are polysemous, in that they can denoteTable 19.4 Complementation strategies in Manambu

with irrealis.

(a) ‘I will see her appear’ (lit, she will appear I will see)
(b) ‘I will see if she appears’
The sentence in 19.90 could also be understood as consisting of a juxtaposed dependent
clause and a main clause (see §19.1), if it had a characteristic intonation contour with sharp
rise on the last word of the juxtaposed clause. Then the reading would have been ‘If she had
appeared I would have seen her/it’. This highlights the importance of intonation.
A juxtaposed main clause can be used in lieu of a clausal complement of verbs ma: wa(no say) ‘refuse’ and ya:kya wa- (OK say) ‘agree’, when they refer to a fact or activity and
involve diﬀerent subjects. We will see, at IV below, that if their subjects are the same, the
same-subject purposive or dative-aversive-marked nominalization will be preferred. Potential meaning entails the use of either diﬀerent-subject purposive or a dative-aversive-marked
nominalization. In 19.91, a fact complement expressed with a juxtaposed clause (clause 1) is
contrasted to a potential complement expressed with a dative-aversive-marked nominalization.

Juxtaposition is also used if the clausal complement is in S function of the verb kus@- ‘ﬁnish’.
The clause which corresponds to the complement often cross-references time or manner in
second position. The main clause takes feminine singular cross-referencing as a default option
(see §5.2.3).

Juxtaposition of a main clause can also be used in lieu of a clausal argument in the O slot of
mental processes: knowing, as in 19.93a–b, and forgetting, as in 19.94. The juxtaposed clause
as a complementation strategy can be preposed or postposed to the clause containing the verb
of mental process:

Finally, one main clause juxtaposed to another may be used in lieu of a clausal argument
marking an activity in the S function in a verbless clause, as in 19.95.

[væra-m@na]

‘It is good you came/are coming’ (lit. it is good—you came/are coming)
In each case, the clause boundary is signalled by an intonation break (less than a second
duration).
III. A relative clause with or without an overtly stated head noun can be used to express
clausal complement referring to a fact, as in 19.96a–b. The way of saying ‘tell me why you
came’ is ‘tell me the reason for which you came’.
19.96a [ya-m@na

[wa-m@na]
[wuk@u]
say-2masc.sgsubj.vt+3fem.sgbas.vt listen+1sgimpv
‘You tell why you came, so that I listen’
Another way of saying essentially the same thing is 19.96b. The diﬀerence is that in 19.96a
the speaker is requesting the full story concerning the reason of the other person’s coming,
while 19.96b presupposes a simpler statement—a ‘thing’ fought about:
19.96b [warya-bra
ja:p] [ma: la:kw]
ﬁght+come-3dusubj.p+3fem.sgbas.p thing neg know:neg
‘I do not know why (lit. thing) they fought about’
Headless relative clauses, like the one at 19.25 (and 19.23a), can also be interpreted as
complementation strategies. They can express fact or activity. The syntactic context in 19.25
makes it clear that we are dealing with a headless relative clause: the common argument has
been omitted, but the adjective referring to it remains in its position in the noun phrase.
However, we saw above that a headless relative clause can be almost indistinguishable from
a main clause (cf. 19.26). And clause juxtaposition as a complementation strategy may also
be homonymous with a headless relative clause. So, 19.97a is inherently ambiguous between
reading (a), with a juxtaposed clause as a complementation strategy, and reading (b) as a
headless relative clause.

(b) ‘Do you see the one (female) sitting here further away?’19.8 Complementation strategies501The ambiguity disappears if the second clause is negated: a relative clause would take the
dependent clause negator -ma:r-, and the juxtaposed clause would be negated like any main
clause (§14.5). The negated relative clause is at 19.97b, and a juxtaposed main clause at 19.97c:

A similar example, with a verb of knowledge and understanding, is at 19.98, an angry shout at
a naughty and disobedient child:
19.98 [laku-ñ@na]
[wa-tua]
know/understand-2fem.sgsubj.vt+3fem.sgbas.vt say-1fem.sgsubj.vt+3fem.sgbas.vt
(a) ‘Did you understand that I was telling you (what to do)?’
(b) ‘Did you understand what I was telling you?’
IV. Same-subject purposive marks a purpose complement of any verb if semantically appropriate, as shown in 7.76 and 19.43 (see §19.4.1). Same-subject purposive can also be used as a
complementation strategy with the verb ‘say’ if the subject of the verb expressing purpose or
intention is coreferential with the subject of ‘say’—see 13.45, 19.57 (§19.5.4), and 19.99:

‘When I was a small girl you spoke of marrying me’
V. Different-subject purposive clauses can mark a purpose complement of any verb (see
§19.4.1 and §13.4.2, and 13.54–5). This is also used in indirect commands, as in 19.54 and
13.49. A purposive clause as a complement of the verb wa- ‘say’ is the only way of forming a
diﬀerent-subject complement clause for the concept of ‘wanting’: 19.100 is ambiguous between
‘we told them to go to the house’ and ‘we wanted them to go to the house’. This ambiguity can
only be resolved by context.

house+lk+all go-3du-purp.ds say-1plsubj.vt-3dubas.vt
(a) ‘We told them two to go to the house’
(b) ‘We wanted them two to go to the house’
In 13.51, only the ‘wanting’ reading is appropriate, since there was no speech act involved.
In diﬀerent subject ‘wanting’ constructions, the verb ‘say’ can be omitted, as in 19.101. Then,
there is no ambiguity between ‘telling someone to do something’ and ‘wanting someone to do
something’. Similar examples are at 13.55, and 14.70.

This use of the diﬀerentsubject purposive may be interpreted as an instance of desubordination—whereby the erstwhile
dependent clause becomes a main clause. Diﬀerent-subject purposive clauses are also used as
complementation strategies with verbs of asking, as in 13.52. An alternative is a direct speech
report, or a reported question, in VI below.
VI. Desiderative clause can mark a purposive complement of any verb—see §19.4.2 and §13.5
and 19.47. Desideratives in dependent clauses in O function can be used as complementation
strategies with potential meaning involving verbs of negative desire, such as ‘be unwilling’ in
19.102:
19.102 [wun tapwuk ba:d k@-k@r] [kwas@k yi-na-d@wun-@k]
I
chicken egg eat-des unwilling go-act.foc-1masc.sgbas.vt-conf
‘I am unwilling to eat chicken egg’
A desiderative clause in the direct speech report slot of the verb wa- is the only way of
reporting non-ﬁrst person’s desire—see 19.58 and 13.57. A desiderative clause can be in the
S slot of a verbless clause—see 13.65.
VII. Direct speech reports framed by the verb wa- ‘say’ can be used as complementation
strategies. We saw in §19.5 above that a direct speech report is a special grammatical relation.
The meanings of direct speech reports range from fact/activity to potential, and can involve
statements, questions, and commands.
VIII. Reported questions can be used as complementation strategies in the O slot of the verb
of knowledge/understanding:
19.103 [wun-aba:b ma: la:kw]
[agwa-mi d@-k@-di t@k@-mi-a-di]

du-ta:kw
t@-na-di]
I
neg know:neg how.many man-woman be/have-act.foc-3plbas.vt
‘I do not know how many people they have (in Malu)’
In 19.104, the interrogative quantiﬁer kas is postposed to the noun ‘people’ which is its normal
position (see 10.109–10 in §10.4). Reported questions typically refer to fact or activity. They
are rather rare in discourse of any sort, and may have been calqued from Tok Pisin or even
English.
IX. Nominalizations are widely used as complementation strategies. We can recall, from
§9.1.1, that deverbal nominalizations with Ø-case marking in O function are employed as
complementation strategies, with the verb ‘know’, as in 9.2, and ‘ﬁnish’, as in 4.8. A deverbal
nominalization in S function can also serve as a complementation strategy, as in 9.3. A
nominalization can be a complement of a verb ‘be diﬃcult’, as in 4.7, 9.9, 19.43, and T3.20,
T3.33, and T3.35. An action nominalization can occur in the predicate slot, as in T3.34 (where
it is negated). These nominalizations always refer to activity or fact.
Deverbal nominalizations marked with dative-aversive case -Vk are used in the O slot of
verbs to do with not wanting, refusing, forbidding, feeling shame, as in 9.5–6, 13.78, and 13.81,
waiting as in 9.4, forgetting as in 13.79, being afraid of doing something, as in 13.82, and in the
sense of ‘for fear of’, as in 9.7 and 13.83, or ordering not to do something, as in 15.111.","[518, 519, 520, 521, 522, 523, 524, 525, 526, 527, 528, 529]"
"17.2 Complex predicates containing support verbs43517.2.4 How to choose a support verb for a nominal
The semantic principles behind the assignment of a support verb to particular nominals are not
always straightforward. While ideophones, expressives, and descriptions of natural phenomena
almost exclusively warrant na-, for many nominals referring to physical states the choice
appears to be arbitrary, and the support verb has to be remembered. The nominal wiyaw
‘light and dry’ requires the support verb na-; and the nominal væt ‘heavy’ goes with yi-. The
nominal k@rk@m ‘silent’ requires na-, and its near synonym m@k@m@k requires t@-, as shown
in 17.40.
Alternatively, m@k@m@k (but not k@rk@m) can occur in an aspectual complex verb containing either r@- or kwa- —see 17.39 and 14.117. Both 17.39 and 17.40 have distinct positional
overtones.

Two support verbs can sometimes be interchangeable: karkwas yi- and karkwas kur- ‘squabble’ are a case in point. Not so for the nominal kaig@n ‘quiet’ which requires the support verb
t@-, r@-, or kwa- depending on the subject’s position and the aspectual value of the clause, as in
17.41a–c.

If used in the same clause as yi-, kaig@n can only be interpreted as a modiﬁer to yi- in its
meaning ‘go’ as a main verb—see 17.42.

The nominal component of a complex predicate can be questioned, with at@ta ‘how?’ (see
§10.4), as illustrated in 17.43a–b.
kag@l yi-na
17.43a ab-a
head-3fem.sgnom pain ‘go’:sup.vb-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt

at@ta yi-na?
head-3fem.sgnom how ‘go’:sup.vb-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt
‘Head is what?’ (lit. Head is how?), i.e. ‘What’s the matter with your head?’
This is unlike complex predicates of other kinds, where the non-auxiliary component cannot
be questioned. We can recall, from §4.2.2, that copula clauses are structurally similar to
support verb constructions; moreover, the copula complement shares features with the nominal
component of support verb constructions. The ability of being questioned is one such feature.
An additional complication comes into play. Polyfunctional verbs which form aspectual
and modal complex verbs and occur as support verbs also appear in what can be considered
lexicalized complex predicates. This is the topic of our next section.17.3 l e x i c a l i z e d c o m p l e x p r e d i c at e s
As we saw in the previous section, the choice of a support verb can be fairly unpredictable.
Many support verb constructions are lexicalized. Nominal components of lexicalized complex
predicates vary in their status: some are full nouns, and others have few nominal properties.
For instance, s@kul@k as in s@kul@k yi- (cook go/do) ‘do cooking, cook’ cannot head an NP in
any function other than purpose. Then it is marked with dative case, as in 17.44:
s@kul@k-a:k
17.44 ñ@n
adakw
al@dab
you.fem stay:impv dem.dist+fem.sg+down+term cooking-lk+dat
‘You (feminine) stay right down there, for (the purpose of doing) the cooking’
Whether a nominal component in complex verbs is part of the verb’s argument structure
or not is a diﬃcult question. The meaning of complex verbs is idiomatic to a varying extent.
For instance, the verbs ji- and sakwi- are used only in complex verbs with s@p ‘skin’, meaning
‘be fed up’. The nominal component m@yakw is not used anywhere except with the verb kwa‘stay’; the resulting complex verb meyakw kwa- means ‘like’.
Other complex verbs are semantically transparent. The noun gu ‘water’ in gu yaku- (water
wash) ‘bathe’ can be interpreted as the unmarked typical location for ‘washing oneself’; sua:l
‘lie, story’ can be interpreted as the object of taka- ‘put’, and kur- ‘do’, in expressions sua:l takaand sua:l kur- ‘to lie’. The verbs yaku- ‘wash’, taka- ‘put’, and kur- ‘do’ are transitive if used on
their own. Complex verbs ‘bathe’ and ‘lie’ are intransitive. That is, a nominal component of a
complex verb may aﬀect the transitivity of the whole.
Numerous complex predicates consist of a nominal which usually cannot head a predicate
on its own, followed by a verb from a closed class. They share the following features:
(i) they form two independent phonological and grammatical words;
(ii) their components tend to be contiguous, and only constituents such as ata ‘then’,
reactivated topic demonstratives, and adverbs can intervene between them;
(iii) the order of components can be reversed as a means of marking afterthought;
(iv) the nominal component cannot be questioned;
(v) the nominal component or the verb can be ellipsed if clear from the context;
(vi) it is often the case that the nominal component is not used elsewhere in the language;
and
(vii) they are translated into Tok Pisin or English as one verb, and when code-switching
takes place they are replaced with a one-word verb.","[461, 462, 463]"
"50419 Other Dependent Clauses19.9 de s u b o r d i nat i o n o f d e p e n d e n t c laus e s
What is an essentially dependent clause can come to be used as a main clause through regular
ellipsis of the erstwhile main clause. This phenomenon known as ‘desubordination’ has been
described for numerous languages, including English (see Stirling 1998). Desubordination and
the change of status of clauses can result in the creation of new tense-aspect-mood paradigms
(as in Australian languages: Dixon 2002a: 148–9), or evidentiality (as in Estonian: Aikhenvald
2004a: 281–3).
Just three of the medial dependent clause types in Manambu are used on their own (see
§18.2–4). In each case, this can be considered ellipsis; however, each use has its own semantic
overtones and can be analysed as a new clause type ‘in the making’.
Sequencing medial clauses with the verb marked with -n (§18.2) appear as strong commands,
as shown in 16.96, and 19.109—an annoyed order to a naughty child to be seated:
19.109 jupwi
taka-n
backside put.down-seq
‘Put your backside down!’ (lit. putting your backside down!)
A medial completive same-subject form on its own can also be used as a command, an
even stronger one. The illocutionary force is comparable to German participle commands, e.g.
hingesessen! ‘sitting here!’ An example is at 19.110—the mother was even more annoyed than
when she shouted 19.109:
19.110 t@k@r-@-m
da-ku
chair-lk-loc sit-compl:ss
‘Sit down on the chair immediately!’ (lit. Having sat on the chair!)
These command strategies ﬁll what can be conceived of as a ‘gap’ in the system. We saw
in §14.4.1 that Manambu has three prohibitive forms: a general prohibitive and two strong
prohibitives. But there is only one positive imperative (§13.2). The diﬀerent degrees of strength
of command corresponding to the degree of strength of prohibition are expressed through
command strategies employing desubordinated clauses. Rough correspondences, with numbers
of example sentences, are in Table 19.5.
A medial sequencing clause can be used as a complete sentence if it states the result of an
activity, as in 19.111. A pause of less than a second’s duration signals a sentence boundary.
There is no pause between the two sequential verb forms in the second sentence.

Manambu does not have a morphological resultative derivation—desubordinated medial
sequencing clauses play the part of ‘resultative’ strategies.
Medial completive clauses, typically same-subject ones, can be used on their own, with a
completive meaning. A speaker came into the house and showed us a ﬁsh, commenting on
how she had obtained it:
19.112 [sa:n yapi-ku]
money buy/pay-compl.ss
‘I have paid money (for it)’ (lit. having paid money (for it)
This completive use is semantically close to the meaning of the anterior complex predicate
with the auxiliary t@- discussed at §17.1.1. Yet, it is diﬀerent inasmuch as the focus is on the
completion of the action and the result achieved.
Desubordination has its roots in ellipsis. Yet the two are diﬀerent. Consider 19.113b, an
answer to the question in 19.113a:
19.113a ak@
s@k@r væra-k-ñ@na
what.fem.sg time come.back-fut-2fem.sgsubj.vt+3fem.sgsubj.vt
‘What time will you come back?’
19.113b [na:gw yapi-ku]
sago buy-compl.ss
‘After I had bought sago’ (lit. having bought sago)
This has a clear overtone of sequencing and of relative tense: ‘I will come back after I’ve
bought sago’. Not so with 19.112 which simply focuses on the completion of an action. (An
additional way of focusing on the completion of one action before the start of another is
through using ya:kya ‘OK’ or its Tok Pisin equivalent orait in lieu of a main clause. We return
to this in §20.4.2.)
Along similar lines, a cotemporaneous clause can be used on its own, to express prolonged
action that started before the moment of speech and goes on and on. An example is at
19.114—a mother was exhausted by her baby daughter’s drinking and peeing non-stop. Similar
examples are at 4.33 and 18.35.
19.114 [gu
k@-ta:y]
[wus yi-ta:y]
water consume-cotemp pee go-cotemp
‘All she does is drink and pee’ (lit. having drunk water having peed)
Desubordinated cotemporaneous clauses typically occur in pairs, as in 19.114, 4.33, and
18.35, referring to continuous alternate or simultaneous actions. Since Manambu does not
have a dedicated verbal form to cover this meaning, once again a desubordinated verb can be
said to ﬁll in a gap.
Desubordination of the three dependent clause types discussed here goes hand in hand with
grammaticalizing the most frequent desubordinated forms into connectives. We saw in §18.3
that the form t@-ku (stand-compl.ss) operates almost like a conjunction ‘thus, and so’ (18.28).","[530, 531, 532]"
"8.2.3 Possessor cross-referencing on the verb
Since the possessed noun, and not the possessor, is the head of any possessive noun phrase in
that it controls agreement on the modiﬁers and on the predicate, the possessor cannot normally
be cross-referenced on the verb. It can be cross-referenced occasionally, if in contrastive focus,1788 Possessionas in 8.26 (the possessive construction here is of D2 type). The cross-referenced possessor is
underlined.

‘They used to eat my ﬂesh’ (lit. they used to eat me (on) my ﬂesh) (said the turtle)
As shown in §7.3, under (iv), the locative-accusative -Vm case can mark a third argument
of ditransitive verbs, if the beneﬁciary or recipient is fully aﬀected, or the gift is permanent
(as in 7.27). Examples like 7.26 (‘The Gala married women from/of Washkuk’, or ‘belonging
to Washkuk’) and 8.27 can be considered instances of possessor raising since the possessor is
treated as the object:

‘He smashed the woman’s head’ (lit. he head-smashed that woman)
In 7.26 and in 8.27, the possessor (‘Washkuk’ and ‘woman’ respectively) does not form one
noun phrase with the possessed (‘woman’ and ‘head’, respectively). The possessive relationship is understood from the context; and the locative-accusative case indicates the complete
aﬀectedness of the possessor in each case. This ‘possessor raising’ is available for body part
possession only.","[204, 205]"
"16.1.3 Bound directionals and directional suﬃxes: a comparison
Bound directionals (A–C in §16.1.2) and directional suﬃxes (D in §16.1.2) share a major
semantic function: both provide directional speciﬁcation to the clause. Yet, they diﬀer in a
number of grammatical properties summarized in Table 16.4 and discussed below.
I. Valency changing is a property of bound directionals. A strictly intransitive verb with
a bound directional has a telic meaning and an obligatory directional speciﬁcation. There is
often a noun phrase specifying the direction of action. An example is at 16.57:16.1 Directionals399Table 16.4 Directional suﬃxes and bound directionals

‘That snake there jumped downwards, onto the ground, after he had jumped (there was
a sound) wa!’
A directional with an intransitive non-motion verb makes it telic, and adds a resultative
overtone, as in 16.63 (puku-su- (bulge/get.fat-up) ‘get big’).
A directional used with an ambitransitive verb of either S=O or S=A type has a diﬀerent
eﬀect: it restricts the verb’s transitivity to just its transitive use. We will see, in §16.2, that the
causative-manipulative kay- may have a similar eﬀect.
The verb t@p- ‘be closed, fence oﬀ’ is an S=O ambitransitive. With a directional, it is always
transitive, as illustrated in 16.23, 16.30, and 10.22b (also see 12.3). The eﬀect of a directional
is similar to that of -taka ‘put’ as V2 in asymmetrical compounds (see 15.62–3). The verb
piñu- ‘slide, slip’ is an S=O ambitransitive. If accompanied by a bound directional, it has a
transitive meaning: piñu-sada-tua (slide-down-1sgsubj.vt+3fem.sgbas.vt) means ‘I slide (it)
downwards’. The verb ‘look’ used with a directional means ‘look at something; in the direction
of something’, or ‘with a particular purpose’—see examples 16.12, 16.19, 16.34, and especially
16.55–6. If the verb ‘say’ is used with a directional, the addressee needs to be expressed, as in
16.6, or understood as in 16.10.
The valency-changing or, better, valency-adjusting eﬀect of bound directionals is especially
clear with the general verb m@gi- ‘do whatever, happen’, which is S=O=A ambitransitive.
Without a directional, it can have any transitivity value, depending on what the speaker has
in mind. In 16.58a it is used transitively:
m@gi-d@-d
16.58a kam@m
breadfruit+lk+acc do.whatever-3masc.sgsubj.p-3masc.sgbas.p
‘He did whatever to breadfruit’ (in the context: grabbed the breadfruit)
Its intransitive use is shown in 16.58b—this example shows that m@gi- is an S=A ambitransitive:40016 Directionals and Valency-Changing Devices16.58b yakraw m@gi-da-l
thunder do.whatever-3masc.sgsubj.vt+3fem.sgbas.vt-3fem.sgnom
‘It was that (that time) thunder did whatever’ (in the context: struck)
An example like 16.58c shows that the verb m@gi- is also an S=O ambitransitive:
16.58c l@-k@
mæn atawa
m@gi-l-a
she-obl+fem.sg leg like.that do.whatever-3fem.sgbas.p-3fem.sgnom
‘It is the case that her leg whatevered like that’ (in the context: her leg became paralysed)
If accompanied by a directional, m@gi- has to be transitive, and also refer to a telic action.
Examples are 16.16, 16.42 (also see the full paradigm at 16.2), and 16.58d (here the omitted O
is the foot).
16.58d [a-m@gi-su]
[k@
mæn n@k@r n@k@r kur-kwa]
impv-do.whatever-up dem.prox.fem.sg foot cold cold get-impv.3p+fem.sg
‘Whatever it (the foot) up (in context: put your foot up), may your foot get really cool’
In contrast, the directional suﬃxes -tay ‘sideways away from speaker’ and -tæy ‘sideways
towards speaker’ do not have any such eﬀect: m@gi-tay- (do.whatever-to.side.away) may mean
either ‘move or aﬀect (something) to side’, or ‘move itself to side’; piñu-tay-tayan (slideto.side.away-to.side.away+seq) means ‘sliding side to side’, and may also mean ‘make something slide side to side’, depending on the context.
That is, one set of directionals aﬀects transitivity, and the other set does not. The inherently
directional verbs—each of which corresponds to a bound directional (Table 16.1)—do not
aﬀect the verb’s valency (see §15.2, and also V below). The morphological make-up of the
bound directionals accounts for their valency-changing eﬀect. As mentioned above, they could
be composed of the transitive verb s@- ‘put, plant’ followed by an inherently directional verb.
We can recall that verbs sada- ‘put down’ and saku- ‘push outwards’ which contain s@- as an
intrinsically directional verb are transitive.
This corroborates our hypothesis that the transitive verb s@- ‘put, plant’ imparts a transitivizing value to these morphemes.
II. Adverbial usage is a property of a few bound directional forms, such as -su ‘upwards’ in
16.59–61 and -saku ‘outwards’ in 16.29. We can recall, from Table 16.1, that the directional
-su is unusual in that it is not directly relatable to an inherently directional verb, unlike other
directionals in the paradigm. In their adverbial usage, the directionals modify the verb, as does
the form wuk@-su (listen-up) used in the sense of ‘lending one’s ear’ while listening, in 16.59
(repeated from T3.30; a similar example is in T3.27).

‘Having gone to another house, she sat on the big post listening to what was above’
The versatile nature of the form wuk@-su becomes apparent in an adjacent sentence within
the same story (T3.31) where this same form occurs as a bona ﬁde verb, wuk@-su:n (listenup+seq) ‘having listened (to what was above)’. A similar example, with the directional -saku
‘outwards’, is at 16.29 (second line).
A directional verb used adverbially can mark manner, as in 16.60:16.1 Directionals40116.60 k@

‘He held on to (the tree) by throwing this ankle of his foot upwards, that old man’
This is reminiscent of the directionals used with ‘look’. But, unlike any other directional, it
can be used with the inﬂected predicate ellipsed, as in 16.8.
The directional -su ‘up’ used with the generic verb s@- ‘put, plant’ in 16.61 has a somewhat
idiomatic meaning, ‘upwards/upstream a little bit’.

then come-1masc.sgbas.vt
‘(A group from) Japanday having gone out a little bit upstream, established themselves
there (lit. put (line) ), then I came’
We can recall, from A above, that the directional -su ‘up’ does not refer to the upstream
direction—unlike the directional -war in ka-war- ‘bring/take upwards or upstream’. The form
s@su is unlike other directionals in an additional way—it can be used in a noun phrase, similarly
to a postposition, as 16.62.

‘Here it is (closer to you), upstream from where the high school is’
Verbal forms marked with directional suﬃxes -tay ‘sideways away from speaker’ and -tæy
‘sideways towards speaker’ are never used adverbially.
III. Reduplication of a directional is an exclusive property of the directional suﬃx -tay
‘sideways away from speaker’ (see 12.67, 12.70, 16.47). No other directional, including -tæy
‘sideways towards speaker’, can be reduplicated.
IV. Lexicalization is a property of many directionals, especially those meaning ‘across away’
and ‘outwards’— -saki and -saku, and -tay. A few verb roots only occur accompanied by
directionals, e.g. r@m-su (?-up) ‘come up (plants in a garden); heap up (ground)’.
V. Potential replacement with a partly synonymous directional verb is a property of
bound directionals. The directional suﬃxes do not have this option.
There are two alternatives. The ﬁrst one is to use a verb compound with an inherently
directional verb as V2 . The compound describes something happening while moving in one
of the six directions encoded in inherently directional verbs—that is, concomitant motion (also
see §15.2.2, examples 15.6 and 15.8–12).
Verb forms with bound directionals do not have an additional movement overtone. In
contrast, they indicate the directionality of the action upon an object. They may also imply
that the position of an object in space was aﬀected.
The pairs in Table 16.5 illustrate the diﬀerent semantic eﬀect of verb compounds with
inherently directional verbs, and of bound directionals, with the verb yak@- ‘throw’ which
implies motion and directionality, and with the verb yaku- ‘wash’ which does not.","[425, 426, 427, 428]"
"502 Phonologywith CCV∼CVC structure count as heavy, e.g. blà-taká ‘spoke and’, grà-taká ‘cried and’, vyàtaká ‘hit and’, grà-yak´@p ‘cry in vain’. That is, Manambu displays the phenomenon of ‘onset
moraicity’.
The same-subject purposive suﬃx (3 in Table 2.4) requires full reduplication of a light verb’s
root, e.g. k@-ká:k ‘so that (same subject) should eat’, kwa-kwá:k ‘so that (SS) should stay’, s@sá:k ‘so that (SS) should plant’. 14 With a heavy root, the form is -@k, as in kayk@t-´@k ‘so that
(SS) should hold on to’, war-´@k ‘so that (SS) should go up’. (With CCV∼CVC roots, the form
is -a:k, as in blá:k ‘so that (SS) should speak’.)
Suﬃxes 4–5 attach to verb root followed by person markers, and undergo CV reduplication
if the verb root is light, e.g. v@-tù-k@k´@k (see-1sg-purp.ds) ‘for me to see, so that I see’, v@tù-k@k´@b (see-1sg-as.soon.as) ‘as soon as I saw’. The resulting forms are partially inﬂected for
person (§3.1; §11.1.1). Unreduplicated allomorphs are used with heavy roots, e.g. wàr-tu-k´@k
‘for me to go up’, wàr-tu-k´@b ‘as soon as I went up’, wakù-tu-k´@k ‘for me to go out’, wakù-tuk´@b ‘as soon as I went out’, blà-tu-k´@k ‘for me to speak’; blà-tu-k´@b (speak-1sg-as.soon.as)
‘as soon as I spoke’. If a verb stem consists of a sequence of CV-CV roots it is treated
as heavy (each of the roots on their own would be light), e.g. wa-yà-tu-k´@k (say-come-1sgpurp.ds) ‘so that I carry on saying’. The future marker (6 in Table 2.4) attaches to the verb root
and is followed by person markers (§12.2); the resulting forms are fully inﬂected for person.
Examples with light root involve full reduplication of the suﬃx, e.g. wa-k´@-k@-tuà (say-futfut-1sgsubj.vt+3fem.sgbas.vt) ‘I will say it’. The unreduplicated form -k@- occurs with heavy
roots, as in wàr-k@-tuá ‘I will go up’, blà-k@-tuá ‘I will speak it’, kayk@t`@ -k@-tuá ‘I will hold
onto it’.
Each of the verb forms containing suﬃxes discussed here has an iambic stress pattern. They
can be seen as consisting of two feet each with an unstressed (light) syllable followed by a
stressed (heavy) one. The additional syllable created by reduplicating the initial CV of a CVCV
or CVC suﬃx or the initial CVCV of a CVCVC suﬃx serves to satisfy the requirement that
a multisyllable verbal word containing a monomorphemic suﬃx of heavy syllable structure
be divided into two feet of equal length (this agrees with the average length of a preferred
phonological word in Manambu: see §2.5.1). The iambic stress principle is restricted to verbs,
and thus provides an additional point of phonological diﬀerentiation between verbal and nonverbal roots. 152.5 phonolo gical word
2.5.1 General properties
The main criterion for a phonological word is stress (Dixon and Aikhenvald 2002). Most
frequent types include CV(:)C and CV(:)CV(:). A phonological word cannot contain more
than one long vowel. A word of a CV structure tends to contain a long vowel, e.g. yi: ‘ﬁre’, wu:
‘ton fruit’, ma: ‘again; negative’. (There are a few exceptions, e.g. s@ ‘name; who?’). Otherwise, it
tends to cliticize to another word, as does l@ ‘she’ (see §2.5.3). Or the vowel may be optionally
14 In contrast, the dative-aversive case marker -Vk, formally reminiscent of the same-subject purposive (see §7.11),
can attach to a monosyllabic noun without reduplication, e.g. s@ ‘name’, sa:k ‘for/for fear of name’.
15 The iambic principle does not apply if a suﬃx is of structure -CV(:)y (e.g. -ta:y ‘cotemporaneous sequencing’:
§18.4; -ga:y ‘unlikely condition’: §18.8), or -CVr (e.g. -k@r ‘desiderative’: §13.5). That it does not operate with the suﬃx
-l@k ‘because’ (§18.7) may be due to the fact that this suﬃx is a product of a recent grammaticalization of a free form
al@k ‘this is why, because’.","[76, 77]"
"4.2 Verbs81B. Polyfunctional Verbs: copula verbs, support verbs, and auxiliaries
Manambu has ten verbs which can each be used in two or three of the following functions—as
copula verbs, as support verbs, and also as auxiliaries. Five of them are also used as lexical
verbs. A summary of these verbs and their functions is in Table 4.1.
When used as copula verbs, they head the predicate of copula clauses which involve two
arguments but cannot be considered either transitive or intransitive (see Dixon 2002b for
a typological overview of copulas, and §20.1.3). In Manambu, the relationship between the
two arguments of a copula clause—the copula subject and the copula complement—covers
identity, attribution, location, and possession. Their choice depends (a) on the meaning of the
copula construction, and (b) on the semantic type of copula complement. Further meanings
typically associated with copula clauses can also be expressed with verbless clauses or nonverbal predicate heads—we return to this in §20.1.3.
When these polyfunctional verbs occur as auxiliaries in complex predicates, they impart
an aspect or modality speciﬁcation to the whole construction, and take further tense, aspect,
mood, and modality inﬂections (see §§17.1–4).
Some also occur as support verbs with uninﬂected verbs, carrying tense, aspect, mood,
and modality inﬂections. Such uninﬂected verbs include completive, completive-intensive, and
customary aspects, desiderative and frustrative modality, and a few other categories detailed in
Table 11.1. Loan verbs typically require a support verb, e.g. stati t@- (start support.verb) ‘start’.
Support verbs are similar to the so-called ‘light verbs’ (see a deﬁnition in Matthews 1997), used
to construct verbal expressions with accompanying nouns or with borrowed verbal roots (see
Haig 2001: 213 on similar use of ‘do’ in Kurmanjî and Zazaki, both Iranian). See §17.2 for
details. In addition, some polyfunctional verbs appear in lexicalized complex predicates—see
§17.3.
Five of the polyfunctional verbs can also be used as independent lexical verbs. These are
positional verbs ‘stand’, ‘sit’, and ‘stay’, and the verbs kur- ‘do, take, get’ and yi- ‘say; go’.
These have a full range of grammatical forms including imperatives. The other ﬁve verbs do
not have a full range of grammatical forms—for instance, they cannot form imperatives.
Each of the ten verbs featured in Table 4.1 can be considered polysemous and multifunctional. The regularity of their multiple functions points towards the appropriateness of a
polysemy, rather than a homonymy, analysis. But can we decide which of the uses is primary?
We address this issue in §17.2.
When these verbs are employed as copula verbs, their copula subject shares all syntactic and
morphological properties with subjects (A/S) of other sorts, including cross-referencing on the
verb and case marking. It behaves like an S in terms of its ability to control agreement with the
‘reactivated topic’ deictic marker (operating on an S/O basis)—see §3.3. Copula complements
are diﬀerent from any other argument in that they (i) never take any case marking and (ii)
are never cross-referenced on the verb (see §7.2). All copula clauses show the expected relational meanings—identity, attribution, and location. One copula (t@-) is also used to express
possession and ‘becoming’. See discussion below.
The verbs na- ‘be (of physical states; natural phenomena)’, tay- ‘be (of climatic states)’, yasa-/
yas@- ‘be (of physical states, e.g. hunger, thirst)’, say- ‘be (of some states, e.g. shame)’, and yæy‘be (of smells)’ occur with a restricted set of formally unmarked nouns or nominals, and can be
interpreted in either of two ways. They may be viewed either as copula existential verbs with the
corresponding nouns and nominals in the copula complement (CC) slot, or as support verbs
for such nouns and nominals. We can recall, from §4.1.2, that many nominals can only occur
as CC of such verbs. The copulas na-, tay-, and yasa-/yas@- allow the option of having a zeroAs copula verbAs support verbAs auxiliary verbAs open-class verb1. t @-‘become’,

A nominal part of the predicate containing a support verb shares morphological and syntactic properties with copula complements. Both are formally unmarked, cannot be negated or
questioned separately from the verb they precede, and have a ﬁxed position in a clause (they
can only be separated from it by the connective ata or the reactivated topic demonstratives).
The major diﬀerence is semantic: when used as copula verbs, the multifunctional verbs listed
in Table 4.1 reﬂect one or more of the relational meanings typically associated with copula
clauses (see §20.1.3 and Dixon 2002b). When used as support verbs, they are eﬀectively mere
‘placeholders’ for the inﬂectional categories which cannot be expressed otherwise.
The verbs listed under 6–10 can be seen as primarily support verbs with a strong semantic
and partially syntactic similarity to existential copulas. A broken line separating columns 2 and
3 for these verbs in Table 4.1 reﬂects this indeterminacy in their status.
We will now discuss the polyfunctional verbs in Table 4.1 one by one.
1. The copula t@- in the meaning of ‘become’ was illustrated in 3.8–9. It is used as a support
verb with uninﬂected frustratives in 4.9–10. It can also be used as an existential verb as
illustrated in 4.16–17; then it occurs with either a locative, or a reactivated topic demonstrative.

‘The ghost is (there)!’ (said, in fear, by Tanina, then 8 years of age)
The verb t@- can also be used in the meaning of ‘have’, as in 4.18. Its second argument is
similar to the copula complement in that it is not cross-referenced on the verb. If a reactivated
topic demonstrative occurs in such a construction, it agrees in gender and number with the
subject of t@- and not with the possessed entity. This indicates that the subject of t@- behaves
like an intransitive subject (S) no matter whether the verb is used with one argument, or with
two.

The verb t@- also occurs in idiomatic collocations. When preceded by a body part noun in
dative case it refers to something wrong with this particular body part, e.g. ab-a:k t@- (headlk+dat be/stand/have) ‘be not quite right in one’s head’ (see §17.2.3).
2. The copula r @- ‘sit’ can be used as an existential verb; then it requires either a locative or a
reactivated topic demonstrative (just like the copula t@-), as in 4.19.

shallow’; value, such as perfect or strange; physical properties, human propensity, qualiﬁcation,
e.g. r @ p- ‘be enough’, and position. Adverbs are used for speed, while diﬃculty is covered
with nominals. Similarity is expressed with postpositional structures (see §4.5.2 on k@t@k ‘like’).
Quantiﬁcation is marked with quantiﬁers (§10.5). Ordinal and cardinal numbers are a special
class (§10.6.1). An exception is ta:y ‘ﬁrst’ which is an adverb.4.4 a dv e r b s
Adverbs form a semi-open heterogeneous class of over forty members. They do not have any
grammatical categories characteristic of other word classes. Their major syntactic function
is to modify verbs. Unlike manner arguments, adverbs are never cross-referenced on the
verb.
Many underived adverbs are monosyllabic, e.g. k@ p ‘just’, ma:k ‘personally, in person’, b@
‘already’, ma: ‘again’, ta:y ‘ﬁrst, preceding’, the reﬂexive-emphatic ka:p ‘oneself, by oneself’
(4.63; §16.2.4). Some are disyllabic, e.g. (ma:) n@bay ‘not yet’, walba:b ‘close’, wayway ‘maybe’,
jaujay ‘in a sloppy, incorrect way’, and arguably also the reciprocal marker awarwa (in itself, the
comitative case form of the noun awar ‘side, sideways direction’: see §16.2.4). A few adverbs
come from nouns, e.g. s@k ‘far’, from s@k ‘long distance’; ma:k ‘in person’, from ma:k ‘face,
person’ (as in 4.69), or gañ ‘last’, related to g@ñ ‘tail’ (4.60–2).
4.60 S@sawi ta:y, d@ gañ ata yi-b@r
Sesawi ﬁrst he last then go-3dubas.p
‘Sesawi went ﬁrst, he (Kamkudi) last’
The alternative form of the same adverb is g@ñ ‘last’ which coincides with the noun ‘tail’,
and could be a back formation from the noun in its use as modiﬁer, where it also means ‘last’,
e.g. g@ñ-a ta:kw (tail-lk woman) ‘last/non-ﬁrst wife’.
Adverbs may contain derivational suﬃxes which have the same segmental make-up as case
markers. The suﬃx -Vb is similar to the terminative case -Vb and is used to derive adverbs
from some nominals (which are typically used as copula complements), e.g. kwam-a:b (crazylk+term) ‘by mistake, not thinking’, s@k-a:b (far-lk+term) ‘far, from afar, to a far point’,
from noun phrases, e.g. kwasa-m@y-a-b (little+fem.sg-very-lk-term) ‘little by little; a little bit’,
from nouns, e.g. ta:l ‘past’, tal-a:b ‘long time ago’, and from other adverbs, e.g. k@ p ‘still, yet,
just’ (see §21.2.2), k@pa:b ‘in case’, awar ‘one-sidedly’, awar-@-b ‘in turn’.
This same formative occurs in some adverbs which do not appear to be derived (synchronically), e.g. waya:b ‘in very recent past; just now’; s@ms@ma:b ‘no way’. This formative also
occurs in nakamib ‘together’, from nak, nakam@y ‘one’. The meaning of this suﬃx is hardly
predictable; similarly to the terminative case, it is stressed.
The suﬃx -Vr is similar to the allative-instrumental case -Vr. Unlike the case suﬃx, it is not
stressed. It is used to derive adverbs from nouns, e.g. g´@ñ@r ‘later’ (cf. g@ñ ‘tail’; g@ñ´@r ‘to tail;
with tail’), from some non-agreeing adjectives, e.g. s@mir ‘along’ (from s@mi ‘long’) and páp@r
‘a little later’ (from pa:p ‘short’) and from underived adverbs, e.g. ta:y ‘before, in front, ahead’,
tá:yir ‘previously; towards the front’; m@y ‘very’, m´@yir ‘really’.
This same formative appears in a few other adverbs, such as japwár ‘conveniently’, yapwur
‘quickly’. Note that the allative-instrumental case forms are reminiscent of adverbs in their
semantics and usage, especially if repeated, as in ab-á-r ab-á-r (head-lk-all head-lk-all)4.4 Adverbs101‘head ﬁrst’. The adverb kuk´@r ‘after, later’ is also used as a postposition (see §4.5.2). A
few inherently repeated adverbs are derived from verb roots, e.g. pakwúr pakwúr (hide+all
hide+all) ‘in a secretive way’ (from pa:kw- ‘be hidden’).
A formative -Vk, similar to the dative case marker -Vk, appears in mad@k mad@k ‘especially,
namely’. The comitative -wa appears to derive adverbs with the meaning of ‘all the referents’
from a few nouns, e.g. mi: ‘tree; high’, miy-awa ‘together; whole’, t@ p ‘village’, t@p-awa ‘the
whole village’ (see §7.9). A few derivational formatives occur on numbers (see §10.6.1) deriving
adverbs, e.g. -k@r@b ‘together’, as in v@ti-k@r@b ‘two together’. The formative -ta:y in b@ta:y
‘already’ may be cognate to the verbal cotemporaneous sequencing suﬃx -ta:y (§18.4). This
adverb is unusual in that it can occur with the verbal conﬁrmation marker -@k, beta:y@k ‘right
now, already’ (see §12.5). A few adverbs typically occur repeated, e.g. yapwur yapwur ‘quickly’,
or reduplicated, e.g. s@ms@ma:b ‘no way’, wayway, w@yw@yau ‘maybe’, and r @ka:r@k ‘properly’.
The adverbial derivational suﬃxes (none of which is productive, or semantically predictable)
are the only adverb-speciﬁc morphological property.
A few frequently used forms containing the suﬃx -@n ‘manner sequencing’ are on the
way towards becoming grammaticalized as adverbial manner modiﬁers (see §19.9). Examples include yi:n (go+seq) ‘all along’, as in ñikiñiki yi:n k@l@b say-na-di (red go+seq
dem.prox+fem.sg+term ﬁnish-act.foc-3plbas.vt) ‘red (colour) all along (the sheet) ﬁnishes
here’, kray-in (bring-seq) ‘up until’, and s@b@n-@n (return-seq) ‘back’, as in s@b@n-@n a-kray
(return-seq impv-take) ‘take (it) back!’ However, they have hardly any of the morphological
properties of the adverbs outlined in Table 4.4. They cannot be considered bona ﬁde members
of the class of adverbs despite their meanings and can be treated on a par with verbal forms,
with one proviso: they cannot be negated independently.
All three agreeing adjectives can be used adverbially (that is, to modify a verb, or an
adjective)—see 4.53 above. The agreeing value adjective yara ‘ﬁne’ forms part of a derived
adverb yara-kara (which contains a formative not found anywhere else in the language).
Just like verbs, nouns, and adjectives, all adverbs can be heads of intransitive predicates.
Most adverbs can be modiﬁers in noun phrases. They do not require a linker, e.g. bas wari
(ﬁrst ﬁght) ‘ﬁghting for the ﬁrst time’, ta:yir ñaj (early+adv father’s.brother) ‘the father’s
brother (who was here) earlier’, ta:y ta:kw (early/precedingly woman) ‘ﬁrst wife’ (also see
4.77, ‘previous hole’), miya-wa du (tree+lk-com man) ‘all the men; all men together’ (also
see 15.100).
Table 4.4 features a comparison of morphological properties and syntactic functions of
adverbs with the three other major word classes—nouns, verbs, and adjectives (see Table 4.2).
1. Negation. If an adverb is the head of an intransitive predicate, it is negated just like a
noun or an adjective in the same function: the negator ma: is placed after the predicate head
(which has no person markers); and no tense distinctions are made, e.g. s@k ma: (far neg) ‘it
is not far’—as a general statement which can refer to present, past, or future. If tense has to
be expressed, then a verbal negative construction with the copula (most often t@-) is used. See
§§14.1.1–2.
2. Compounding is typically not found with adverbs—a property they share with agreeing
adjectives. Just occasionally does an adverb form a compound, e.g. ab-a-gañ (head-lk-last)
‘very last’.
3. Reduplication of adverbs has an ‘intensive’ meaning, e.g. ka:p ‘alone, by oneself’ (also used
as a reﬂexive marker: §16.2.4), kap@-ka:p ‘really alone’, and also as in 4.61:1024 Word ClassesTable 4.4 Morphological properties and syntactic functions of adverbs in comparison with other

‘Thus stepping she went, right after (behind) him, she the very last, he the very ﬁrst’
4. Semantics of -p@k ‘like’ when it occurs with adverbs is similar to that with nouns and verbs,
e.g. miy-a-wa-p@k (tree-lk-com-like) ‘as if all, like it were all’, yabib-a-p@k (quickly-lk-like)
‘as if it were quick’. This suﬃx is not used with most monosyllabic and disyllabic adverbs.
5. The infix -ka- ‘intensive’ is used with just two adverbs: ka:p ‘on one’s own’, kap@-ka-ka:p
‘absolutely on one’s own’, and k@ p ‘just; for nothing’, k@ p-@-ka-k@ p ‘well and truly for nothing’.
6–7. An adverb can modify a verb, as shown in 4.63; this is a function adverbs share with
adjectives. An adverb can modify a nominal copula complement, but not an adjective.
8. An adverb can be a copula complement, e.g. k@p kwa-na-d (just stay-act.foc3masc.sgbas.vt) ‘he just stays, stays for nothing’. Some such constructions have idiomatic
meanings, e.g. ma:k kwa- (in.person stay) ‘be born’.
9–10. Just like a verb, an adverb cannot be head of an NP or an argument. An adverb can
be modiﬁed by m@yir—just like a verb, e.g. m@yir yapwur yapwur ma:j bla-kwa-na (real+adv4.5 Closed classes103quickly quickly talk speak-hab-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt) ‘she speaks really fast’. This is the
only instance of an adverb modifying another adverb. One adverb, gañ ‘last’, can be modiﬁed
by m@y- ‘real, very’, just like a noun or an adjective, as in 4.62:
4.62 ada
gañ kwa:d
m@y-a-gañ
dem.dist.react.top+masc.sg last stay+3masc.sgbas.p real-lk-last
‘Then he stayed there last, really last (the very last)’
As shown in Table 4.4, adverbs share some properties with nouns and adjectives, and some
with verbs. Adverbs can be positioned anywhere in a clause (unless they modify a noun, in
which case they precede that noun). A clause can contain up to three adverbs in the corpus
collected, as shown in 4.63 (adverbs are in bold):
4.63 a-di
t@p
ka:p aba:b b@
kiya-di
dem.dist-pl village alone all
already die-3plbas.p
‘Those (of) the village already all died by themselves’
This is a unique syntactic property of adverbs: a clause or an NP cannot contain more than
two modiﬁers of other sorts. Some connectives are connected with demonstratives (see §4.5.3).4.5 c lo s e d c la s s e s
Closed classes in Manambu include (a) personal pronouns (Table 3.3 and §10.1); (b) demonstratives (§10.2); (c) indeﬁnites (§10.3); (d) interrogatives (§10.4); (d) quantiﬁers, e.g, sama:sam
‘many, much’ (§10.5); and (e) numerals (§10.6). All of these, with the exception of demonstrative
and interrogative adverbs, are similar to nominals in most properties. They diﬀer in the
amount of nominal morphology they take; in their position within a noun phrase; and in their
syntactic functions (whether they can be heads of intransitive predicates, copula complements,
or modiﬁers). Demonstrative and interrogative adverbs do not take nominal cross-referencing
sets when they head a predicate.
Further closed classes are modal verbs, postpositions, emphatic particle, connectives, hortative, interjections, and onomatopoeia.","[126, 127, 128, 129, 130]"

Derivation and Compounding
Manambu has a few derivational mechanisms which change word class (§9.1) and a number of
those which do not (§9.2). Nominal compounding is discussed in §9.3.9.1 wo r d c la s s -changing derivations
Fully productive action nominalizations are derived through full reduplication of the verb’s
root. These are discussed in §9.1.1, in the light of other functions of reduplicated verbal root.
Non-productive deverbal nominalizations and a partially productive adjectivizing derivation
are addressed in §9.1.2. There are no morphological means for deriving a verb from a noun.
One adjective, vyak@t ‘good, beautiful’, is related to a verb vyakanaku- ‘correct, improve’ via a
unique process. (Neither has cognates in other Ndu languages.)9.1.1 Full reduplication of verbal root and its functions
Full reduplication of verbal root is a productive means of deriving action nominalizations, e.g.
war- ‘go up’, warwar ‘going up’; nas(@)- ‘count’, nas@nas ‘counting’ (see §2.2.1 on the insertion
of @ to break an unauthorized consonant cluster); kawar- ‘take up’, kawar-kawar- ‘carrying
and going up’; yawi kur- (work do) ‘work (verb)’, yawi kur-kur ‘doing work (noun)’.
If a root ends in -u and undergoes full reduplication, the ﬁnal vowel is reduced to -w and,
if it follows a stop, is realized as labialization of the last consonant, as in waku ‘go out’,
wakuwakw ‘going out’. If a verb root has a structure CVC1 C2 V, and C2 is y, the ﬁnal vowel
is dropped and y becomes i , as in warya- ‘ﬁght’, warya-wari ‘ﬁghting’. Monosyllabic roots with
the vowel a acquire the shape CaC@ when reduplicated, e.g. da- ‘go down’, da-d@ ‘going down’,
ra- ‘cut’, ra-r@ ‘cutting’. Nominalizations are stressed on the last syllable; whether they form
one phonological word depends on the syllable count (see §2.5). Nominalizations can occur
in S or O function, as obliques and as part of complex predicates (see §4.1.2). They cannot
be part of a possessive NP or be modiﬁed. All nominalizations have the verb’s argument
structure and argument marking (their A/S is Ø marked, as in 9.1 and 9.4, and their O can
be unmarked, as in 9.2–3, or marked with accusative-locative case following the principles in
§7.2, e.g. 4.7).
But is every reduplicated verb a nominalization? We will see below that the reduplicated
forms diﬀer in their semantics and in their syntactic possibilities depending on their function
and the type of additional marking they take. The broad meaning ‘action nominalization’
appears to be fully applicable to some combinations of form and function of reduplicated verb
root, and only partly so to others. We will use this term here for convenience. At the end of this
section we return to the problem of whether all these can be analysed as one category.","[205, 206]"
"14.1.3 Contiguity in non-future negative constructions, and the scope of negation
In future negative constructions, the verb and the negator are always contiguous, and form one
phonological word. In non-future negative constructions, contiguity is not required. Then the
order of the negator and the verb cannot be reversed: the negator has to precede the negative
verb.
The only form which obligatorily intervenes between the negator and the negated verb is the
adverb n@bay ‘yet, already’, as in 14.20. Any other order is ungrammatical (see 14.20a).
14.20 d@ ma: n@bay yæy
come.neg
he neg yet
‘He has not come yet’
14.20a?? ∗ d@ n@bay ma: yæy
he yet
neg come.neg
‘He has not come yet’—???
The following types of constituents may intervene between the negator and the negative verb
form. The eﬀect is focusing on the intervening constituent. As mentioned in §20.3, individual
constituents hardly ever occur in highlighting focus in negative constructions. Changing their
position in a clause is one way of focusing them.
1. The adjective yara ‘well, ﬁne’ used adverbially can intervene between the negator and the
negated verb, as in 14.21a where ‘well’ is in focus.
14.21a wun ma: yara la:kw
I
neg well know.neg
‘I do not know (this) well (contrary to what you may expect)’30414 NegationIn 14.21b, ‘well’ is not in focus:
14.21b wun yara ma: la:kw
I
well neg know.neg
‘I do not know (this) well’
2. The object can intervene between the negator and the negated verb, as in 14.22–3, with the
object in highlighting focus:
14.22 man-ta:b ma: ap
t@
foot-hand neg bone/force have.neg
‘(His) hands and feet had no strength’
14.23 k@ta wun ma: br@-k@-m
wuk@mar
now I
neg 3du-obl-acc forget.neg
‘Now I haven’t forgotten these two (white people) (despite the fact that we lost touch)’
3. The copula complement can intervene between the negator and the negated verb. In 14.24,
the narrator stresses that people and apawul spirits are not friendly because of a number of
misunderstandings—in contrast, they fear each other:
ma: kapawi t@
14.24 al@k
ñan-awa
this.is.why we-lk+com neg friend be.neg
‘This is why (they) are not friends with us (they are scared of us)
4. The subject can intervene between the negator and the verb. An example of the A of t@‘have’ is at 14.25—this is what a speaker said about her siblings:
ma: ñan t@
14.25 takwa-d@ka
du-a-ma:gw
woman+lk-only man-lk-’thing’ neg we have.neg
‘(We are) just women, we (in contrast to others) do not have brothers’
In 14.26, gu ‘water’, in the S function, intervenes between the negator and the verb:
r@
14.26 ma: gu
neg water sit.neg
‘There was no water (in contrast to what was expected)’
5. An oblique in a locative, or an allative case, can intervene between the negator and the verb,
as in 14.27–8, and T3.14:
14.27 [yæj
k@-na-wur
t@n@b-a:m
r@-na]

krakw
14.28 ma: ña:r
neg sun+lk+all take+outside
‘(The two brothers) did not take (their new sister) out into the sun’ (contrary to what
would be expected)
6. A part of complex predicate marked with the sequential -n (see §17.1.1 and §16.2.3) can
intervene between the negator and a posture verb, as a means of focusing on the lexical verb:14.1 Declarative non-habitual clauses30514.29 ñan [Malu kwa-na
nagw@m]
ma: væn
r@
we Malu stay-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt sago+lk+acc neg see+seq sit+neg
‘We did not sit watching the sago that was staying at the Malu village’
Examples like 14.21–9 are common to all generations of speakers of all levels of proﬁciency.
In most such cases, the intervening word does not exceed two syllables. An exception is at
14.24—but note that it comes from a story by an elderly man who was trying his best to be as
elaborate as possible.
Only highly elaborate speakers allow a whole clause to intervene between the negator and
the verb. Examples are at 14.30 and 14.31.
br@-k@-k
ma:k] ta:k
14.30 a-d@
a:s ma: [ya:n
dem.dist-masc.sg dog neg come+seq 3du-obl-dat face put.neg
‘That dog did not show his face by coming to them two’ (contrary to what they expected)
In 14.31, two constituents intervene between the negator and the negated verb—the adverb
n@bay (for which this is the only possible position) is placed close to the negator, and followed
by a dependent clause ‘like I stay’. The spirit of a dead woman refuses to give her living husband
the food she eats in the world of the dead:
ma:,
14.31 m@n-a:k

you.masc neg yet
‘I won’t give you these ﬁsh, those shrimp, you are not yet in the same state as I am
(contrary to what you may think)’
There is an intonation break between ma: n@bay ‘not yet’ and the rest. This is not surprising:
ma: n@bay behaves like a ﬁxed expression.
If a multiword complex predicate consists of an inﬂected auxiliary and an uninﬂected part
(see Chapter 17), the uninﬂected part of the complex predicate intervenes between the negator
and the inﬂected part. This is shown in 14.32.
t@
14.32 d@ væy ma: warya-n
he spear neg quarrel/ﬁght-seq have+neg
‘He hadn’t fought with spear’
To focus the uninﬂected part of the complex predicate, this has to be preposed to the negator.
Note that the uninﬂected part of the complex predicate cannot follow the negative form of the
auxiliary—this is in contrast to uninﬂected verbs which are not part of complex predicates
(§17.1–2). In 14.33, the speaker focuses on the fact that she had never ever seen European-type
long hair (she had heard of this, but this was her ﬁrst-time visual experience):
nab [ñ@n-a
14.33 wun tala:b væ-n ma: t@
I
before see-seq neg have.neg hair you.fem-3fem.sgnom
t@-na-p@k]
have-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt-like
‘I have never before seen hair like you have’
Complex predicates consisting of a nominal and a verb are negated just like other complex
predicates in 14.32: the whole complex predicate follows the negator, as in 14.34–5:30614 Negation14.34 wun ma: s@kul@k y@
I

‘I didn’t do the cooking’
ma: j@b@ kwa:r
14.35 wun k@
t@pa:m
I
dem.prox village+lk+loc neg image do/get+neg
‘I didn’t learn to write (lit. get image) in this village’
The position of negator and the eﬀect of reversing the order of the nominal, or the
dependent-marked verb, and the negated verb help diﬀerentiate superﬁcially similar complex
verbs containing auxiliaries (as in 14.33–5) and sequencing structures (as in 14.29).
In none of the examples discussed above does the change in the position of the negator
aﬀect the scope: the negator consistently has the whole clause within its scope. There is just
one exception. The adverb m@yir appears to be unique in that the scope of negation diﬀers
depending on its position in a clause. In 14.36, m@yir ‘really’ precedes the negator, and the verb
is within the scope of negation.
14.36 a-di
ma:j n@k@-di du-ta:kw
m@yir ma: la:kw
dem.dist-pl story other-pl man-woman really neg know.neg
‘Other people really do not know those stories’
In 14.37, this same adverb intervenes between the negator and the verb. Either the verb or
the adverb can be understood as being within the negator’s scope. The ambiguity is resolved
by context.
ma: m@yir la:kw
14.37 a-di
ma:j n@k@-di du-ta:kw
dem.dist-pl story other-pl man-woman neg really know.neg
‘Other people do not really know those stories’ or ‘Other people really do not know
those stories’
Manambu has no negative pronouns. The numeral ‘one’ in its indeﬁnite meaning is used in
negative clauses, meaning ‘not one’, as in 12.7 (nak-a:b@ ma: y@ (one-too neg go) ‘not one
escapes’), and T3.14 where the form nakam@y ‘single one (feminine)’ is used.
If a constituent other than the predicate is to be negated, it has to form an independent nonverbal clause negated by ma:. To say ‘not only in Avatip’ one literally says ‘only in Avatip—no’,
as in 14.38. The non-verbal negative clause is in square brackets.

A negative non-verbal clause can occupy the same position as a noun phrase. For instance,
the word for ‘bald’ is nab ma: t@- (hair neg have). How this term was used is shown in 14.39
(an example of the argument elaboration construction: §6.2.3). That ma: ‘negator’ forms one
constituent with nab ‘hair’ and not with the verb t@- ‘have’ is evident from the form of the14.2 Negation of habitual clauses307verb: it is inﬂected as a positive, and not as a negative verb. A negative form of t@- is shown
in 14.40—this sentence was used to describe a girl who is not bald, but whose hair had been
shaved because of lice. (Constituency is indicated with square brackets.)
14.39 [an
Bob wuk@n] [nab ma:] t@-na-bran

‘We two, Bob and I, are bald’ (lit. we have there-is-no hair)
14.40 nab [ma: t@]
hair neg have.neg
‘She has no hair’
Negating one constituent as a separate non-verbal clause produces the eﬀect of strong
contrast. One sister is saying to the other: ‘We two will eat that sago with coconut’, and the
younger sister replies 14.41:
ma:, bal-awa
14.41 ka!
t@p-a:wa
dem.prox+3fem.sgnom coconut-lk+com neg pig-lk+com
k@-k@-ta
eat-fut-1dusubj.vt+3fem.sgbas.vt
‘ “That? (meaning: no way!), not with coconut, we will eat (sago) with pork!” ’
A similar example is at 10.145 (‘few, not many, few people went down (river)’).
As we will see in §14.6, the negator ma:—unlike any other negator—can be used as a
complement of the verb wa- ‘say’ with the meaning of ‘forbid, negate, refuse’. This is illustrated
in 9.5, 13.78, and 14.42. In such constructions the verb wa- remains inﬂected as required. The
second occurrence of ‘say no’ is negated in the last line of 14.42.
wun-a:k
14.42 alaku

get.ﬁre-red-dat no, impv+go.out they.two neg say.neg neg
‘ “Across there they will refuse (say no) to me getting ﬁre.” “No, go out, they won’t
refuse” ’
This example also illustrates another usage of ma:—that of a general negative pro-clause.
We return to this in §14.6. Inherently negative lexemes (see §14.6) co-occur with clausal negator
ma:. They do not have the same scope eﬀects as does ma:. Neither do other negators.14.2 ne gat i o n o f h a b i t ua l c lau s e s
Habitual clauses (which require the verb in habitual aspect marked with the suﬃx -kwa‘present’, -yikwa- ‘past’: see §12.3) are negated with the negator ak@s which occurs with the
verb in habitual aspect (marked with the suﬃx -kwa-). Unlike the general negator, ak@s cooccurs with fully inﬂected verbs, as in 14.43–4, 10.5, and 10.60. The negative habitual refers to
what is typically not done.

14.43 ñ@n
you.fem neg.hab eat-ﬁnish-hab-act.foc-2fem.sgbas.vt
‘You never eat (things) up’30814 NegationThe copula t@- is obligatorily used to express a habitual non-occurrence involving a non-verbal
predicate head:
14.44 yabi:b ak@s
kuprap t@-kwa-na-di
quickly neg.hab bad
stay-hab-act.foc-3plbas.vt
‘They do not become bad quickly’
We can recall, from §4.2.2, that the verb kui- ‘give to third person’ is quite unusual in that it
has two alternative forms of the negative habitual. Unlike other verbs in the language, it does
not have to take the suﬃx -yikwa- ‘past habitual’ in the past negative form. Two options are
thus available for ‘give’ in past habitual; there is no semantic diﬀerence between the two. The
regular form, kui-kwa- ‘(not) give habitually’, is shown in 4.37 and 14.45:
14.45 ak@s
kui-yikwa-l
d@-k@
ta:kw
neg.hab give.to.third.p-hab.past-3fem.sgbas.p he-obl+fem.sg wife
‘She never used to give (them food), his wife’
The alternative non-habitual declarative form, kui-, with the habitual negator ak@s, is shown
in 4.38 and 14.46. Within the same story, 14.45 and 14.46 follow each other.
ak@s
kui-d
14.46 ñaj

paternal.uncle wife bad-3fem.sgnom neg.hab give.to.third.p-3masc.sgbas.p
‘Paternal uncle’s wife was bad, she never gave (children food)’
A negative construction containing the negator ak@s and an inﬂected verb forms two grammatical and two phonological words. A habitual negative construction with ak@s does not have
to be contiguous. In 9.21 the copula complement precedes the construction of ak@s followed
by an inﬂected verb, and in 14.44 the copula complement is positioned between the negator
and the inﬂected verb. The eﬀect of inserting a constituent between ak@s and the inﬂected
verb is essentially the same as that in constructions with the non-future negative structures
involving the declarative non-habitual negator ma: (see §14.1.3 above): the inserted constituent
is in highlighting focus.
In fact, any constituent, except for subject or object, can intervene between ak@s and the
inﬂected verb. In 14.47 gus ‘paddle’ is part of a complex predicate involving a typical instrument
(see §7.2).
gus
ka-kwa-na-wun
14.47 wun ak@s
neg.hab paddle paddle/row-hab-act.foc-1fem.sgbas.vt

‘I never paddle’
In 14.48, a series of dependent clauses intervenes between the negator and the inﬂected verb:
these clauses contain information which is contrary to what is expected of the river-dwellers:

occur with n@bay ‘yet’. An anterior complex predicate involving the habitual form copula t@and a sequential form of a verb is preceded by ak@s as shown in 14.49 (a non-habitual negated
anterior complex predicate is at 14.32). Any alternative ordering of ak@s and the inﬂected verb
in such structures appears contrived.

The negators ma: and ak@s share some similarities in terms of contiguity in negative constructions; but are not identical in their properties. Unlike ma:, the negator ak@s is not used
to negate non-verbs on their own—that is, without a copula (see 14.44). Consequently, it is
not used to negate a nominal constituent in the way ma: is employed (see 14.41). Neither is it
used as a complement of the verb wa- ‘say’. The negator ak@s can be used elliptically, meaning
‘never’: in its second occurrence in 14.50, ‘never’ is an elliptic clause recapitulating the previous
clause:
yak@-sada-kwa-na-b@r]
14.50 [l@ ñan-a-k@

neg.hab no.way neg.hab throw-down-hab-act.foc-3dubas.vt
‘This salt of ours they would never throw (into their food), never, never ever would they
throw (salt in their food)’
The general non-habitual negator ma: and the habitual negator ak@s are both used as proclauses in elliptical replies—see 14.51 and 14.42.
yaki k@-kwa-na-ñ@n?
ak@s
14.51 ñ@n
you.fem smoke eat-hab-act.foc-2fem.sgbas.vt neg.hab
‘ “Do you usually smoke?” “Never!” ’
Further similarities and diﬀerences between ma: and ak@s are addressed in §14.6.
The same negator, ak@s, is used to negate irrealis in main clauses, and in counterfactual
conditional clauses, and to negate the optative mood—this is the topic of the next section.14.3 ne gat i o n o f n o n- i n d i c at i v e m o da l i t i e s
All of the non-indicative modalities discussed in Chapter 13 can be negated, with the exception
of the frustrative. Irrealis and optative, on the one hand, and same-subject purposive and
desiderative, on the other, are negated in the same way (§§14.3.1–2). Diﬀerent-subject purposive
is negated in the same way as any verbal predicate in a non-main clause—see §14.3.2 and §14.5.
The negation of nominalizations as predicate heads is addressed in §14.3.3.","[330, 331, 332, 333, 334, 335, 336]"
"22.4.1 Borrowings or code-switches?
Distinguishing code-switches and borrowings in Manambu presents a problem.
Borrowings and code-switches are usually considered extremes on a continuum (see the
glossary in Aikhenvald and Dixon 2006). They can be potentially distinguished by (i) frequency
of occurrence (code-switches are often one-oﬀ occurrences); (ii) phonological integration; (iii)
morpho-syntactic integration; and (iv) a number of lexical criteria:
(a) Does an equivalent exist in the other language?
(b) If so, is it in use in the community?
(c) Is the equivalent known to the speaker?
(d) To which language does the individual regard the word as belonging?
(e) Is it in use by monolingual speakers?
Most Tok Pisin insertions are high in frequency. There are no monolinguals in Manambu,
and most ‘inserts’ can be provided with a Manambu equivalent. Even ad hoc and one-oﬀ occurrences of Tok Pisin—and of Papua New Guinea English—words tend to be phonologically and
morphosyntactically integrated.
The absence of full phonological integration may provide a partial clue. The phoneme f ,
shared by Tok Pisin and PNG English but absent from Manambu, is realized either as f or as
p; the two are in free variation, as in faivpela du, paipela, faipela du (ﬁve:tp man) ‘ﬁve men’.
The English tS appears in code-switches as a foreign import, as in tatSi-tukwa (touch-proh.gen)
‘don’t touch!’ Borrowings and code-switches may contain consonant clusters absent from Manambu, e.g. faivpela ‘ﬁve:tp’, i ntrestin t@-na (interesting:E stand/be-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt) ‘it
is interesting’, and the vowel e. Loans and code-switches may display variability atypical of
Manambu forms: for instance Tok Pisin loan, or code-switch, sekan ‘shake hands’ is often
pronounced in a somewhat Anglicized way sekhan. However, all these can be considered tokens
of loan phonology in Manambu. Borrowings, and code-switches, may also present a problem
in terms of how they are assigned to word classes—see §22.4.2, and §4.5.6.
Here is an example of how an ad hoc English import can quickly become morphologically
integrated. At the start of a whole-night working session with John Sepaywus, Pauline Yuaneng22.4 Inﬂuence of Tok Pisin and of English607Laki presented him with a lengthy list of totemic terms for various important objects she had
previously compiled (see the end of §21.5.3). She then asked me, in English, to ‘tick’ the forms
she had got right as we would go through each of them one by one. John Sepaywus tuned in
immediately, and, whenever the term was right, kept telling me a-tik (impv-tick) ‘tick (it)’. No
one in the Manambu community used this verb in their Manambu before or after. So, this
could be considered a one-oﬀ code-switch—yet it was highly morphologically integrated. And
that night it exceeded any other verb in its frequency.
Other foreign imports are more frequent than tik-, but less morphologically integrated. For
instance, some never occur with the imperative preﬁx: one says sekan, or sekhan ‘shake hands!’,
but never ∗ a-sekan, or ∗ a-sekhan—yet this is the term spontaneously used by most people (see
§21.5.3 on its Manambu equivalents). Alternatively, sekhan could be considered an interjection,
or an unsegmentable one-word command.
The only bona ﬁde borrowings could be the ones for which there is no Manambu equivalent,
and which are considered part of the language by at least some speakers. The problem is that
speakers vary in their judgements. Consider the term for ‘peanuts’, nowadays a major cash crop
for Manambu women. I asked one highly proﬁcient speaker how to say ‘peanut’ in Manambu.
Her response was kasan—which is one of the two Tok Pisin terms for ‘peanut’. Her husband,
one of the Manambu ‘purists’ (we return to this in §22.6), told her oﬀ for using a Tok Pisin
import; what he suggested instead was galip—which is also a loan from Tok Pisin galip ‘peanut’.
He did not seem to be aware of the Tok Pisin provenance for this word.
The expression m@n-a waya:m (you.masc-lk+fem.sg way+lk+loc) ‘(let it be done in) your
way’ was considered good enough Manambu by one speaker; where another one rejected it
as a blatant foreignism (he suggested m@n-a-r @b (you.masc-lk-fully) instead). Both speakers
rejected laiki- as a term for ‘like’ as an obvious Tok Pisin form (laikim), suggesting mawul kwana (inside stay-act.foc+3fem.sgbas.vt, lit. inside stay), or m@yakw kwa-na instead. The fact
remains that laiki- is used very frequently by all generations of speakers, even by those whose
Tok Pisin is not 100 per cent.
These examples show that Tok Pisin and English code-switches and borrowings in Manambu
form a hard-to-parse continuum. Borrowings and code-switches span all the open and semiopen word classes. They include:r nouns, e.g. ailan (T1.11), ailand (T1.10) ‘island’, mani ‘money’ (21.4), bus ‘bush’ (T1.21),
stori ‘story’ (21.37), taim ‘time’ (T2.54), pas ‘letter’ in 22.6, and taul ‘towel’ and beg ‘bag’
in 22.32a, c;
r non-agreeing adjectives, e.g. colour adjectives grin ‘green’, blu ‘blue’, dimension adjectives
such as liklik ‘small’, bigpela ‘big’, physical property adjectives, such as strongpela ‘strong’,
and indeﬁnite adjective sampela ‘some’;
r adverbs, e.g. hariap ‘quickly’, from Tok Pisin hariap ‘quickly’, olsem ‘thus, like this’, from
Tok Pisin olsem ‘thus’, ken ‘again’, from Tok Pisin ken ‘again’, the negator nogat ‘no, this
is not the case’, from Tok Pisin nogat ‘there is not’;
r numerals, e.g. wanpela ‘one’, tupela, tu ‘two’ (also see T2.21);
r quantiﬁers, e.g. planti ‘plenty’, from Tok Pisin planti (22.36);
r conjunctions, e.g. sapos ‘if, suppose’, from Tok Pisin sapos ‘if’ (22.8) and tasol ‘only,
contrastive linker’, from Tok Pisin tasol ‘only, but’ (T2.3, 22.7), o ‘or’ (T2.50), and even
clause-chaining markers nau ‘then, as soon as’ (Tok Pisin nau ‘then’) and pinis ‘completive’
(Tok Pisin pinis ‘completive aspect marker’).
We now turn to the morphological and syntactic integration of such forms.","[633, 634]"
