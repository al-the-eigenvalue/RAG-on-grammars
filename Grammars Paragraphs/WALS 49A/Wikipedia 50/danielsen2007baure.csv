"[RP-N3-70]In (58) the specific verb -esasa- ‘crack’ has been incorporated into a construction
with the empty verb root -ke-. In this kind of incorporation, there is generally the applicative suffix -čo attached after the compound verb, which refers to an instrumental
role of a possible argument. The question could also be translated as ‘What did you
crack it with?’.
3.8. Parts of speech
The main distinction in Baure is between nouns (3.8.1) and verbs (3.8.2). Adjectives
are a subcategory of nouns, even though they are distinguishable from other nouns.
The Baure corpus shows that there are at least three semantic classes of adjectives
with mainly nominal, but also some verbal morphology (3.8.3). Nouns, verbs and
adjective class III are open word classes. Adjective classes I and II seem to be closed.
Adverbs (8.1) have closed subclasses, such as place adverbs, but the rest of the class
is semi-closed. Chapter 7 shows how a preverbal particle has been derived from a
verb base and developed further into an adverb. In addition, it is sometimes difficult
to distinguish some adverbs from discourse particles and others from nouns. Closed
word classes include pronouns (8.3), determiners (8.2), clause connectors (10.1), preverbal particles (7), the negative particle (9.2), the interrogative particles (9.4), interjections (8.4.1), and discourse particles (8.4.2). I do not want to claim that all of the
closed classes are always easily distinguishable on the base of their morphology, but
I do claim that they can be distinguished on the base of their functions.
3.8.1. Nouns
As in other languages, nouns in Baure refer to “the most time-stable concepts”
(Payne 1997:33) and are prototypically names for “persons, [animals,] places, and
things” (Schachter 1985:7). Nouns function as arguments in a clause and as heads in
head-modifier constructions. They involve the following categories: inherent gender,
number (optional), possession, inherent class, and a peripheral case (locative). Gender is only apparent from related cross-reference clitics on predicates and demonstratives within an NP. Number distinguishes singular (unmarked) and plural, marked by
the morphemes -nev ‘PL’ or -anev ‘hPL’ for some human nouns. Plural marking is
generally optional, but seems to be obligatory on human nouns. Possession is an important category of nouns. It divides them into bound (obligatorily possessed) and
free nouns (optionally possessed or non-possessable). The possessor is marked by aCHAPTER 3 - MORPHOLOGICAL PROCESSES AND WORD CLASSES101personal proclitic on the noun that is possessed (head-marking). For a large number
of noun roots it is possible to derive a bound or free form by application of certain
affixes. The majority of bound nouns can also function as classifiers, in addition to
the approximately 21 grammatical classifier roots. Noun class is an inherent category
of nouns, as there is a kind of agreement marking on modifiers and incorporated into
verbs. Generally every noun is only part of one noun class and the classifier system
in Baure seems to have developed into a noun class system (cf. 4.7). An example of
an NP including classifier marking is shown in (59):
(59)nti’ nimono te mpose senti čose.
nti’ ni=imono te
mpo-se
1SG 1SG=buy DEM2m three-CLF:oval
‘I buy the three big watermelons.’senti
čo-se
watermelon big-CLF:oval
[LO/GP-18/7/04-72]Nouns are generally marked by a determiner within an NP, as te ‘DEM1m’ in (59).
The determiners consist of one article and three different demonstratives. Only a few
nouns can occur without a determiner when they refer to a mass concept.
The locative marking on nouns referring to locations could be considered an
oblique case. However, there are no core cases in Baure, as generally semantic roles
are marked on the verb (head-marking). Specific locations are derived by compounds
of nouns with locative noun roots, as e.g. -api ‘under’ in (60):
(60)mesi-ye
mesi-ye
table-LOC
‘on the table’mesapi-ye
mes-api-ye
table-under-LOC
‘under the table’Some other morphemes that are frequently, but not exclusively, attached to nouns are
diminutive -či and augmentative -ča, distributive -he, emphatic -i’, and the clausal
enclitics. Compounding is an important process for deriving new nouns.
Nouns may also function as predicates in a clause, as non-verbal predicates. The
distinction between verbs and non-verbal predicates is indispensable: The subject of a
non-verbal base is marked by an enclitic, whereas all verbs have subject marking by a
proclitic. This is contrasted in (61) and (62):
(61)nka peronowoni!
nka pero-no-wo=ni
NEG
be.lazy-NOM1-COP=1SG
‘I am not a lazybones!’(62)naperow.
ni=apero-wo
1SG=be.lazy-COP
‘I am lazing around.’Nominal morphology and the classifier system are described in detail in Chapter 4,
and the description of non-verbal predicates is discussed in Chapter 5. Therefore the
term “predicates” is used when referring both to verbs and non-verbal predicates andBAURE: AN ARAWAK LANGUAGE OF BOLIVIA102“predicate phrase” when referring to verb phrases and phrases headed by non-verbal
predicates.
3.8.2. Verbs
As in other languages, Baure verbs generally express the “least time-stable concepts”
(Payne 1997:47) and refer to “actions, processes, and the like” (Schachter 1985:9).
Their main function is that of a predicate in a clause. Verbs can be distinguished from
nouns, because they can only take the place of an argument in a clause when nominalized. Verbs cannot be pluralized like nouns, as shown in (63):
(63)*nošimonev
no=šimo-nev
3PL=arrive-PLbut:nošim
no=šim
3PL=arrive
‘they arrive(d)’Verbs are always bound and minimally have a subject proclitic attached (63). Transitive verbs can also have an object enclitic attached and ditransitive verbs two object
enclitics, in the order recipient–patient (cf. examples in 3.4.1). The majority of verbs
are transitive, with only a few exclusively intransitive verbs. The majority of intransitive verbs can also be used transitively under certain conditions or with some semantic extension. Ditransitive verbs are mainly derived.
Verbs can be very complex and they consist of the different levels of root, stem,
and base, to which different morphemes attach. The categories marked on verbs are
change of valency, aspect, irrealis, and directional. Further there is classifier and
noun incorporation.
Valency can be increased with the causative prefix i(mo)- ‘CAUS’, the benefactive
suffix -ino ‘BEN’, and the applicative -čo ‘APPL’. Valency can be decreased with the
perfective/reflexive suffix -po ‘PRFLX’, the reciprocal suffix -koko ‘RCPC’, and the
attributive prefix ko- ‘ATTR’. The attributive prefix derives i.a. stative verbs. In addition with the passive suffix -si ‘PASS’ these stative verbs can be interpreted as an
agentless passive.
Aspectual suffixes are -wa ‘TEMP (temporary)’, -wapa ‘COS (change of
state)’, -wana ‘DEP (departitive)’, -pa ‘GO (go, intentional, future)’, -poreiy ‘REP (repetitive)’, -poeiy ‘REPN? (negative repetitive, not anymore, never again)’, and -i ‘DUR
(durative)’. The copula suffix -wo ‘COP’ is also used as a verb root -wo- ‘be (locative)’, and its effect mainly depends on the semantics of the verb. Stative verbs and
verbs that refer to processes become imperfective with the copula suffix, but
achievement verbs are interpreted as perfective when the copula suffix is attached.
The irrealis suffix -ša ‘IRR’ plays a role in conditional clauses. Directional roots are
the already mentioned -pa ‘GO’ and its opposite -pik ‘COME’.
Further there are some specific suffixes, as e.g. the approximative -so ‘APRX’,
subjective -’ino ‘SBJ’, and the weather and environment morpheme -hi ‘WE’.
A number of suffixes are not exclusively attached to verbs, such as the distributive -he ‘DISTR’, emphatic -i’ ‘EMPH’, absolute -ko ‘ABS’, diminutive -či ‘DIM’, and
the linker -a ‘LK’.","[122, 123, 124]"

have a fixed position in relation to the predicate, whereas adverbs do not.
Adverbs are mainly different from other constituents in a clause because of their
relatively free positioning. Most of the adverbs are clausal adjuncts and occur clause
initially or clause finally, but they may also occur in other positions, e.g. preceding or
following a predicate they refer to.
One important function of temporal adverbs is the disambiguation of a clause in
respect to time reference. Verbs do not have a tense category. Therefore, temporal
adverbs function to specify time, as contrasted in (78) and (79):

considered adjectival homomorphs:

3.8.5. Pronouns and determiners
The classes of pronouns and determiners are closed. There are seven personal pronouns that have all been derived from the personal proclitics102, as e.g. piti’ ‘2SG’ <
pi- ‘2SG’. They are distinguished for person and number, and for gender in 3SG. The
possessive pronouns have been derived from the personal pronouns, as e.g. pitir
‘2SGP’ < piti’ ‘2SG’. Personal pronouns may replace a noun or refer to it as an anaphor, but generally they only occur in emphatic focus on the pronominalized argument. Otherwise arguments are marked by clitics on verbs. Personal pronouns also
occur in juxtaposition with unmarked non-verbal predicates. Possessive pronouns are
less frequently used for possessor marking, as this is done by possessor proclitics on
nouns. However, there are some otherwise not possessable and non-derivable nouns
that can get possessor marking by means of possessive pronouns. In this case they are
modifiers within NPs. This mainly holds for Spanish loanwords. Another important
function of possessive pronouns is that of non-verbal bases for possessive relations,
as in (84):
(84)nka ntirowor.
nka ntiro-wo=ro
NEG
1SGP-COP=3SGm
‘It is not mine.’[DC-17/4/06-23]Pronouns are described in 8.3. The closed class of determiners consists of one article
and three types of demonstrative pronouns. The article is actually gender-neutral, but
usually interpreted as masculine. The different types of demonstratives are distinguished for number and gender. They are used initial to an NP, but they can function
as free pronouns as well. Determiners do not take any affixation. Only clausal clitics
may be attached to the demonstratives, but not the article. Determiners are described
in 8.2.
3.8.6. Clause connectors
Clause connectors are grammatical particles that are used for clause linkage. They
always appear clause initially: [C1] [co C2]103. Subordinate clauses are only distin102
103Or the other way around: the clitics have been derived from the free pronouns by reduction.
C = clause or sentence; co = connectorCHAPTER 3 - MORPHOLOGICAL PROCESSES AND WORD CLASSES109guishable from coordinate clauses by the specific connective; dependent clauses do
not show any different morphological or syntactic behaviour than independent
clauses. There are a number of different coordinating connectives, conjunctive, disjunctive, and adversative connectives. Subordinating connectives are causal, final or
consecutive, negative consecutive, and temporal. One of the connectors also functions as a complementizer. Clause linkage and the use of the connectors are described
in 10.1. Other kinds of clause linkage are relative clause and multiple predicate constructions and clause chains, as described in 10.2 and 10.3.
3.8.7. Other particles
There are some other particles in the Baure language, of which some are discussed in
separate chapters and sections. Very important for predicate phrases are preverbal
particles and one postverbal particle (Chapter 7). Preverbal particles seem to take
over part of the tasks of verbal suffixes. In a fixed position preceding the predicate
they have an effect on the predicate phrase. Some of these particles are identical to
adverbs; others have been derived from verbs. The verbal particles express aspect and
mood. Some are used for different kinds of imperatives: cohortative, jussive, and an
intentional imperative for 1SG.
There is a general negative particle nka ‘NEG’, which can be used for the negation
of all kinds of predicates (cf. 9.2). The negative particle also functions as the negative
copula base, which is non-verbal according to the kind of argument marking: A subject is marked by an enclitic.
Further there are interrogative particles ko ‘why’ and kon ‘who, what’. The latter
developed from a phonologically reduced nominalized verb woyikwon (be.I-COPNOM1), as described in 9.4.
Other particles are interjections (8.4.1) and discourse particles (8.4.2).","[128, 129, 130, 131]"

[GP-N1/II-30]All demonstratives, but not the article, can function as pronouns as well. In relative
clauses and cleft constructions all determiners can function as heads or relative pronouns (cf. 10.2). The reason why to ‘ART’ is not used as an anaphoric pronoun is the
fact that it cannot be stressed and is bound to the following element like a clitic (cf.
8.2.1). Therefore clausal enclitics can also only be attached to demonstratives, but not
to the article.
Phonologically all determiners seem to be related. Table 8.8 demonstrates the
different determiners, although their exact meaning is often unclear.

DEM3Table 8.8: The article and demonstrative pronounsAs the table shows there are dotted lines between the article and the feminine demonstrative ti ‘DEM1f’. The Baure speakers might have partly incorporated the Spanish
article system and use ti ‘DEM1f’ like a feminine article for mainly human referents.
Meanwhile they can also use the gender neutral article to with feminine referents. In
the plural the categories article and present demonstrative are merged.
In the singular all demonstratives are distinguished for gender, just like personal
pronouns. The feminine form is derived from the masculine form by vowel change,
e.g. teč > tič. The proximate and distal demonstratives are morphologically more
complex than the present demonstrative te/ti. The present demonstrative seems to
constitute the basic form, whereas the proximate demonstrative is supposed to have
been derived with the morpheme -čo (possibly -čo ‘NOM2’ or -čo ‘APPL’), and the
distal form with the morpheme -no (possibly -no ‘NOM1’). The morphemes attached
are mainly attached to verbs in nominalization.
The plural forms are composed of the article and the plural demonstrative, as e.g.
to neč ‘DEM2PL’. The indefinite pronoun to ka is also marked by the article (cf.
8.3.5), possibly marking the nominal character of the pronoun. The plural forms can
only be used when the following noun is also marked for plural with the morpheme -(a)nev, as shown in (20):BAURE: AN ARAWAK LANGUAGE OF BOLIVIA312(20)nonik to neč etonanev.

neč eton-anev
3PL=eat ART DEM2PL woman-hPL
‘The women are eating.’[HC-2/7/04-13]The following sections attempt to differentiate the meaning of the article from the
demonstrative pronouns.
8.2.1. The article
The article to is a bound morpheme, has to be followed by an NP, and directly attaches to the following element within the NP. The article could be considered a clitic
and, indeed, shares many properties with the personal clitics. In some examples the
speakers used the article instead of a personal clitic. In these examples the neutral
form to replaces the 3SGm clitic ro-, and the feminine demonstrative ti replaces the
3SGf clitic ri-, as illustrated in (21) and (22):
(21)(22)“hehow”, tokoponier.

‘My aunt also fled.’[RP-N6-34]
ti=pino-po
3SGf?=flee-PRFLX
[RP-N14-3]I do not want to attach much importance to these examples, because when asked,
other speakers do not accept these expressions.
The monosyllabic article is frequently phonologically reduced, as e.g. in the negative indefinite pronoun nka to ka [ngat ka] ‘nothing’.
The article does not mark definiteness. It is generally used with proper names and
heavenly bodies, such as to ses ‘the sun’ or to kiher ‘the moon’, and nouns that refer
to weather phenomena, such as to vir ‘the wind’ or to sowon ‘the rain’. The article
does not introduce characters in a narration. That is done with teč/tič/to neč ‘DEM2’.
The article can then be used when the NP is already topic and known to the hearer.
The form to is the least marked or emphatic form of the determiners. It occurs
more frequently in specific constructions, such as cleft or relative clauses and before
nominalized verbs.
8.2.2. Present demonstratives
The present demonstratives are used like the article for topic NPs, but they are differentiated for gender (which has partly been merged with the article as well). As demonstratives they have a less pointing function than teč/tič ‘DEM2m/f’, but they are
generally used in contrasts, as in (23):

DEM1mThe demonstratives te/ti ‘DEM1m/f’ are called “present” because they are generally
used with something present, maybe visible, already mentioned or topic.
8.2.3. Proximate demonstratives
Proximate demonstratives are used for introducing a character, which may then also
be referred to by the same throughout the whole narration. Example (24) illustrates
the introduction of two main characters and two sentences a bit later in the same narration:

[GP-N1/II-25]
As example (24) shows, the demonstrative is widely used like an article and not necessarily deictically. It may also be related to foregrounding, as it is generally attached
to the main characters throughout in a narration. This foregrounding effect probably
also causes the interpretation of different semantic roles of te/ti and teč/tič/to neč. I
noticed that in an ambiguous position following a verb teč/tič/to neč ‘DEM2’ are interpreted as the agent, whereas te/ti is more frequently the patient, as demonstrated in
examples (25) and (26). The position is ambiguous when there is only one argument
following a verb, which could be agent or patient, especially when the marking on
the verb does not disambiguate it (as in (25)).

[RP-N4-34]
DEM2fThe pronoun tič in (25) is ambiguous, because both agent and patient are feminine
and therefore their semantic roles are marked on the verbs with the same clitic -ri
‘3SGf’. Nonetheless, the pronoun refers to the agent. This is supported by (26), in
which the only argument that follows the verb in the first part is ti ren ‘his mother’
and refers to the patient, while the NP tič ren ‘his mother’ in the second part clearly
refers to the agent.203
The pointing function of teč in contrast to te was already illustrated in (24). Another example with this demonstrative used emphatically with a pointing gesture is:

animal
‘I will kill this animal with an arrow.’[LO/GP-15/7/04-31]The demonstrative pronoun can also be used anaphorically, referring to an afore mentioned item. There it may refer to animate nouns, but more frequently to things or
facts, whereas the personal pronoun is used to refer to humans. This may be observed
in (28) and (29):

e.g. in (14).","[332, 333, 334, 335, 336]"
"CHAPTER 3 - MORPHOLOGICAL PROCESSES AND WORD CLASSES103The verbal morphemes that attach to the verb base can be divided into stative and
non-stative. This division is manifested in the different morphological behaviour of
stative verbs when the non-stative suffixes are attached. Stative verbs can get all stative morphemes suffixed directly, but the non-stative suffixes have to be linked by
the morpheme -a ‘LK’ with the base, already shown in (23) in 3.3.2 above. This rule
also applies to all non-verbal predicates.
The linker can also be found after incorporated classifiers, as shown and exemplified in 3.7.
The locative morpheme -yi is suffixed to a verb when it occurs in a subordinate or
interrogative locative construction, as in (64):
(64)rotikoe’ te ntir kam nti’ nimokiyow.
riti-koe’
te
ntir kam nti’ ni=imok-yi-wo
3SGm-EMPH DEM1m 1SGP bed 1SG 1SG=sleep-LOC-COP
‘Nothing else than where I am sleeping, this is my bed.’
[RP-N3-19]There are also a number of locative roots that are incorporated into verbs in order to
specify the place of an event. Examples are -poe ‘down’, -ači ‘different place’,
and -api ‘under’. Example (65) illustrates the incorporation of a location:
(65)vehpoekow (to poewok).
vi=eh-poe-ko-wo
to
1PL=wash-down-ABS-COP ART
‘We are cleaning the floor.’poewok
floor
[HC-2/7/04-34]The noun in (65) is not even necessary, as this information is already included in the
verb. The complex verb morphology is described in Chapter 6. The cross-reference
of arguments on the verb is the topic of Chapter 5.
3.8.3. Adjectives
Adjectives are “words denoting qualities or attributes” (Schachter 1985:13). Their
main function is to modify nouns. Baure has adjectives, but it is difficult to decide if
they really constitute a separate word class. Adjectives are all nominal. They can undergo all nominal morphology and function as modifiers in an NP. Some nouns can
also function as modifiers, but adjectives predominantly serve this purpose. Dixon
acts on the assumption that “all languages have a distinguishable adjective class”
(Dixon 2004:9). He argues that there are languages with adjectives that are similar to
verbs, and languages with noun-like adjectives (Dixon 2004:12). Baure belongs to
the second type. In Baure there are also a large number of stative verbs, which are
translated as adjectives into English, as e.g. -topok- ‘be dirty’ in (66):
(66)rotopokow te hikoč.
ro=topoko-wo
te
3SGm=be.dirty-COP DEM1m
‘The knife is dirty.’hikoč
knife
[HC-16/8/03-15]BAURE: AN ARAWAK LANGUAGE OF BOLIVIA104These verbs are definitely not part of the adjectives but of the class of verb. They are
bound forms with subject procliticization (ro- ‘3SGm’ in (66)) and verbal morphology.
It is much more difficult to distinguish adjectives from nouns. The problems for
the distinction are: adjectives are frequently identical to heads in an NP; nouns can
function as modifiers as well; adjectives take more or less all the nominal morphology; there is not only one modifier position within an NP, but two.
Example (59) above showed how modifiers may occur in an NP and modify the
head noun. However, more frequently, the head noun has been omitted in Baure, and
the modifier makes up the complete head (as mentioned by Dixon 2004:23), as in
(67):
(67)te čose račkow in apo marok.
te
čo-se
ro=ačko-wo
DEM1m
big-CLF:oval 3SGm=be.full-COP
‘This big glass is full of water or chicha.’in
apo
water ormarok
chicha
[MD-8/8/03-61]The NP te čose ‘the big glass’ is an elliptical expression and is only interpreted as
referring to the glass because the speaker is pointing at it, or he mentioned it before.
In other contexts čose can refer to big watermelons, boats, bottles or other items
(compare to (59) above). This shows very well that the NP is anaphoric and only
definite because of the preceding context. The real head to was ‘the glass’ has been
omitted and must be inferred. In Tariana (North Arawak) as well, “any adjective can
be used without a nominal head in a noun phrase” (Aikhenvald 2004:106).
Some nouns also function as modifiers in an NP, but the number is very restricted. These are mainly hir ‘man, male’, eton ‘woman, female’, and some other
generic nouns, like e.g. -per ‘domesticated animal’.
The different positions of an adjective within an NP are related to the morphological class the adjective belongs.
Even if adjectives in Baure share many properties with nouns and even a few with
verbs, they are also different for certain semantic and morphological reasons. The
most prototypical semantic fields associated with adjectives are dimension, age,
value and colour, as argued in Payne (1997:65) and Dixon (2004:3–4). These semantic classes are almost entirely expressed by adjectives of the morphological class I
(with colour as an exception). Adjectives of class I are right-bound morphemes that
usually attach to a bound noun root or classifier, as čo- ‘big’ in (67). Adjectives of
class II are absolute forms, which means, they remain in an unchangeable form and
do not get a classifier attached. An example is given in (68):
(68)tin monči monik
tin
monči
DEM3f
child
‘that pretty girl’moni-ko
pretty-ABS
[JC-13/8/03-99]Adjectives of class III are all derived forms. They resemble nouns and nominalized
verbs mostly. Classifiers can be incorporated into many of these derived forms. Colour terms are part of class III. One example with an incorporated classifier is (69):CHAPTER 3 - MORPHOLOGICAL PROCESSES AND WORD CLASSES(69)paš ka’an moseran
p-a-š
ka’an
one-CLF:animal-one animal
‘one red animal’105moser-a-no
red-CLF:animal-NOM1
[MD-7/8/03-18]The numerals and the word for ‘other’ (po-CLF) are morphologically part of the adjective classes. They are also right-bound roots to which classifiers or bound noun
roots attach.
Adjectives of class I are rather used for modification, but may also be used as
predicates. Adjectives of class II are mainly used predicatively. Adjectives of class
III are used for both.
The main position for a modifying adjective in an NP is following the head noun.
Class III adjectives always follow the noun. Class I adjectives also follow the head
noun, except for numerals (cf. (69)) and po- ‘other’. Class II adjectives may precede
or follow the head noun.
When used as predicates, adjectives are non-verbal predicate bases, just like
nouns. The subject is referred to by an enclitic, as in (70):
(70)ver anewapani.
ver
ane-wapa=ni
PERF old-COS=1SG
‘I am already old/ an old person.’[JC-13/8/03-95]Adjectives are like nouns in many respects, but they also have some properties in
common with verbs. Even though not used like verbs (not even when predicates),
some verbal morphemes that do not attach to nouns, can be attached to adjectives.
These are the approximative -so, and the quality nominalizer -pi ‘QNOM’, and productive reduplication for marking intensity.
Adjectives of class II and III may also modify verbs. They do so with predicative
adjectives mainly (comparable to other predicate chains, (71)), but also simple unmarked forms modify verbs, as illustrated in (72):
(71)(72)nka henowaperi riyonop.
nka heno-wapa=ri ri=yono-po
NEG

‘She is not good in walking any more/ She doesn’t walk well any more.’

rosoweporeiy-enš čonok.
ro=sowe-poreiy=enš čonok
3SGm=rain-REP=APRV big
‘It’s raining heavily again, isn’t it?’
[JC-1/4/06-5]3.8.4. Adverbs
Adverbs “function as modifiers of constituents other than nouns” (Schachter
1985:20). Semantically they “cover an extremely wide range of concepts” (Payne
1997:69). Just as Payne noted, adverbs are a “catch-all” category (1997:69). All those
words have been assigned to this class that are lexical, free morphemes that refer toBAURE: AN ARAWAK LANGUAGE OF BOLIVIA106the place or time of an event. In addition there are many other words in this class
referring to the aspect, epistemic evaluation, mode, intensity or quantity of an event.
The class of adverbs is semi-closed. Some subclasses are very small and closed, such
as place adverbs, and others are larger, such as temporal adverbs.
The morphology of adverbs does not distinguish them much from other word
classes. The adverb class is too heterogeneous to assign the same morphological
properties to all adverbs. Some basic adverbs are monomorphemic, but others may
show fossilized internal morphology. Some adverbs have been derived from verbs,
some of them by nominalization. Some temporal adverbs also occur with a determiner. Thus there are some adverbs that are similar to nouns.
Particles is the cover term, which includes adverbs, preverbal particles, interjections, and a few other specific forms, referred to in 3.8.7 below.
Especially time words are difficult to assign either to the class of nouns or to the
adverb class, as some of them may occur with a determiner. The words roseskoner
‘day’ and yotoer ‘night’ are presumably nouns, as they can occur with a determiner.
However when they occur together with a determiner, they usually constitute an adverbial phrase, as in (73):
(73)nowoyikow asaw nonik to yotoer.
no=woyiko-wo asaw
no=nik to
yotoer
3PL=make-COP fried.meat
3PL=eat ART night
‘They are preparing fried meat for them to eat at night.’[RP-N4-266]In very few examples roseskoner ‘day’ and yotoer ‘night’ can actually be used as
arguments, for which reason they are rather analyzed as nouns. Words that occur with
a determiner but are never used as arguments but as adjuncts in a clause are assigned
to the adverb class. Adverbs also differ from nouns because they cannot be pluralized, as shown in (74) with different adverbs:
(74)*nakanev, *nokopenev, *napirinev, *mohinev, *tekonev
naka-nev
nokope-nev
napiri-nev
moeh-nev
teko-nev
over.there-PL day.before-PL
also-PL
certainly-PL all-PLPlace adverbs do not get the locative -ye suffixed like nouns:
(75)*naka-ye,
over.there-LOC*noiy-ye,
there-LOC(*)ne-ye101
here-LOCHowever, there is one temporal adverb, used in narratives, which has been lexicalized
including the locative suffix: nakirok-ye ‘once upon a time, long ago’.
Many bound nominal roots form compounds or are incorporated. This is not observed with adverbs.
Some adverbs can also be used as non-verbal predicates with predicate morphology and argument marking, as in (76) and (77):101
It seems to be possible to use ne-ye in songs only, as a kind of place pronoun, but this construction has
probably been used for the matter of rhyme and rhythm.","[124, 125, 126, 127, 128]"
"3. Morphological processes and word classes
Baure is a polysynthetic, incorporating, agglutinative, and head-marking language
(Sapir 1921, Comrie 1989, Croft 2003, Nichols 1986). Words can consist of up to
nine morphemes with one, two or more lexical roots, as in (1):
(1)pehmoekpoeiyin-niš?
pi=eh-mo-i-ko-pa-yi-no=niš
2SG=wash-CLF:woven-DUR-ABS-GO-LOC-NOM1=EXCLA
‘Where are you going to wash clothes then?’[DC-8/3/06-73]The word in (1) consists of a person proclitic, a verb root, an incorporated classifier
(second lexical root), five suffixes, and a clausal enclitic. This is what traditionally
has been called polysynthetic: “to combine a large number of morphemes, be they
lexical or grammatical, into a single word, corresponding to a sentence of English”
(Comrie 1989:45). In a spot check in narratives (1583 words) the ratio was 2,74
(4201 total) morphemes per word95. The ratio is relatively low because there are so
many (monomorphemic) preverbal particles (cf. 7). These particles tend to replace
verbal suffixes. This may suggest a development of Baure into a more analytic language, possibly under the influence of Spanish. Originally Baure may have been
more synthetic, as the typology particularly of the southern group of the Arawak language family suggests (Aikhenvald 1999:86, 2001:171). Only taking the verbs of
these texts into account the ratio becomes 4,38 morphemes per verb.
Along with argument marking by cross-referencing clitics on verbs there is also
incorporation of noun roots and classifiers into verbs and other constituents. These
incorporated roots either refer to an argument of a situation or some other element
involved. Both argument-marking and incorporation lead to the morphological complexity. Further we can detect compounding of noun roots, classifiers, and even
grammatical morphemes into fixed units.
The degree of fusion is extremely low in Baure. Very few morphemes refer to
more than one grammatical category, such as e.g. the personal clitics, which denote
person, gender (only 3SG) and number. As (1) illustrates, each morpheme generally
has one meaning, and morphemes are separable.
The term head-marking has been coined by Nichols (1986): syntactic relations are
morphologically marked on the head rather than on the dependent of a phrase. Examples are the marking of the possessed noun by a possessor proclitic, the argument
marking on verbs, and the additional manipulation of the semantic roles of these arguments by causative, benefactive and applicative marking on verbs. There are no
core cases in Baure, only locative nouns are marked by a locative suffix, a possible
instance of dependent-marking.
If we take argument cross-referencing clitics as inflectional, Baure is a pro-drop
language, in which explicit arguments are frequently omitted. In narratives the subject proclitics, mainly for 3SGm, but also incidentally 3SGf, are omitted when topical.","[103, 104, 105]"

‘We go.’93[RP-4/8/03-16][LO-29/8/03-44](b) They are used as enclitics for object marking on verbs, as in (28) and (29), and
subject marking on non-verbal predicates (30):
(28)(29)(30)nikičowor.
ni=kičo-wo=ro

‘I give it to you.’[GP-21/7/04-28]nitovianowor.
ni=toviano-wo=ro
1SG=neighbour-COP=3SGm
‘He is my neighbour.’Personal enclitics are also used for subject or object marking on the interrogative
particle ko ‘why’, as in (31) and (32):
(31)(32)kopi kačowon?
ko=pi
kačo-wo-no

‘Why do you go?’[MD-30/8/03-4]koro pikomorikon?
ko=ro
pi=ikomoriko-no
why=3SGm 2SG=kill-NOM1
‘Why did you kill it?’[MD-6/3/06-27](c) Even though clitics share many characteristics with affixes, generally, clitics have
greater mobility with respect to the base than inflectional affixes (Halpern 1998:106).
As illustrated above, the personal clitics in Baure occur on different sides of the
hosts, depending on the kind of construction. Affixes in Baure always occur in specific orders and slots, with little variation.
(d) Personal clitics are the base of free pronouns, as e.g. roti’ ‘3SGm’ < ro- ‘3SGm’.
In addition they occur in some idiosyncratic forms (Aikhenvald 2002:55), as in (33):BAURE: AN ARAWAK LANGUAGE OF BOLIVIA94(33)roseskoner
ro=ses-ko-no=ro
3SGm=sun-ABS-NOM1=3SGm
‘day’(e) Cliticization is external to any affixation on the predicate (cf. Halpern 1998:108–
9). Only clausal clitics follow personal enclitics; personal proclitics are not preceded
by any clitics.
(f) Another phenomenon distinguishes the personal proclitics from affixes: The
pausal particle –ha– ‘HES’ cannot interrupt a unit of a base and affixes, but the pause
occurs frequently right after a personal proclitic. This happens when the speaker is
looking for a word, as in (34), where my consultant was searching the word pi’a
‘your body’.

‘You wash your (body), that –er– your, you soap yourself and I rub your –er–
so that we get rid of the dirt on your body.’
[HC-2/7/04-19]
The proclitic pi- ‘2SG’ occurs on its own, but is then again repeated attached to the
word pi’a-ye ‘on your body’. This is also due to the boundedness of the noun, which
cannot occur without possessor marking. Nonetheless, this shows the relatively free
character of this morpheme in contrast to all other affixes, but also to the personal
enclitics.
(g) The proclitics for 3SG on verbs are sometimes replaced by determiners: ro‘3SGm’ can be replaced by to ‘ART’, and ri- ‘3SGf’ by ti ‘DEM1f’. This was not observed with the other clitics.
There are also some important points to be brought forward against the clitichood of
the personal morphemes:
(h) personal proclitics are obligatory and show therefore more affix-like characteristics than personal enclitics. They co-occur with the explicit argument they refer to
and seem to be a kind of person and number agreement (cf. roti’ ‘3SGm’ in (35)).
(i) Personal enclitics, on the other hand, are not obligatory, but pronominal in nature.
They are generally in complementary distribution with the explicit arguments they
refer to, as in (35):CHAPTER 3 - MORPHOLOGICAL PROCESSES AND WORD CLASSES(35)95roti’ roemoner; roemono to nisopot.
roti ro=imono=ro
ro=imono
to
ni=sopot
3SGm 3SGm=buy=3SGm 3SGm=buy ART 1SG=shoe
‘He bought it; he bought me shoes (lit. my shoes).’
[GP-11/7/04-26/27](j) There are special rules that only apply to the personal enclitics -pi ‘2SG’, -ri
‘3SGf’, -ro ‘3SGm’, and -no ‘3PL’. These four selected clitics show an intensive phonological interaction between clitic and host, which cannot be found between base
and affixes (examples have been discussed in 2.5.6).
It is true that in general affixation takes place within the boundaries of personal
cross-reference cliticization. Nevertheless, there is one exception to this: The nominalizing suffix -no ‘NOM1’ can be attached to a verb with personal enclitic as a kind
of phrasal suffix in interrogative constructions (see above in example (15)). The
nominalizer then has the entire verb in its (clausal) scope, as in (36):
(36)rokomorokiyivin kove’?
ro=komoroki-yi-wo=pi-no
3SGm-bite-LOC-COP=2SG-NOM1
‘Where did the dog bite you?’kove’
dog
[RP-6/7/04-3]In conclusion, personal clitics appear on the path of grammaticalizing into agreement
markers, but are still rather clitic-like in behaviour (cf. also Aikhenvald 2002:57).
The result is a continuum, as illustrated in Figure 3.2:
boundfree
affixespersonal
procliticspersonal
encliticsclausal cliticsfree particlesFigure 3.2: The continuum from affix to free particlePersonal proclitics are closer to the bound side of the continuum due to their obligatoriness. Personal enclitics are considered to be more free (if we leave the phonological interaction aside). Clausal clitics are very similar to free particles, and they attach
to nearly any host, for which reason they are ranked closest to the other side.
3.4.2. Clausal enclitics
The clausal clitics are all enclitics. They comprise quotative -hi ‘QUOT’, exclamative
-niš ‘EXCLA’, and approval -enš ‘APRV’. Quotative predominantly plays a role in narratives (37), and it can be considered a second position clitic:
(37)rohirik-hi teč siy-ye teč sipori.
ro=hiriki=hi
teč
siy-ye
teč
3SGm=sit=QUOT DEM2m chair-LOC DEM2m
‘The frog sat down on the chair.’sipori
frog
[EU-N12-28]The other two clausal clitics are mainly used in direct speech for specific pragmatic
purposes, as in (38):BAURE: AN ARAWAK LANGUAGE OF BOLIVIA96(38)aw to –ha– kotis peropes-enš
aw
to
ha
kotis pero-pes=enš
and.not ART HES lizard long-leg=APRV
‘And the lizard has long legs, you know (unlike …).’[EU-N12-52]Theoretically all three clausal enclitics can be combined, but there are only examples
of two enclitics in the data. More details are discussed in 9.7.
3.5. Reduplication
Reduplication mainly concerns lexical morphemes or part of them. There is also reduplication of grammatical morphemes. Many nouns, particularly animal names,
consist of a reduplicated stem, as e.g. sorisori ‘owl’ (cf. 8.4.3). Reduplication is generally progressive and found mainly on verb, adjective, and some adverbial stems for
intensification or emphasis, as in (39):
(39)nihiškier, nihišhiškier
ni=hiš-ko=ro
ni=hiš~hiš-ko=ro
1SG=pull-ABS-3SGm
1SG=pull~INT-ABS=3SGm
‘I pulled it, I pulled it quickly.’[JC-14/3/06-72]Reduplication will be marked by ‘~’ and glossed for its function ‘INT (intensifying)’
(cf. Comrie et al. 2007). In many iterative verbs the reduplicated stem is fossilized as
the only form.
Furthermore, some particles may also be reduplicated for specific emphasis, such
as cohortative ši ‘HORT’ > šiši. Some suffixes may be reduplicated, as e.g. diminutive
-či and augmentative -ča. Other suffixes have been derived from the reduplication of
other suffixes, such as -koko ‘RCPC’ < -ko ‘ABS’.
Reduplication competes with emphatic marking by means of the suffix -i’ ‘EMPH’.
3.6. Compounding
Compounding is a highly productive process in Baure. It is closely related to incorporation and probably played a significant role in the evolution of classifiers. There are
compounds of two free nouns (40), or of a free and a bound noun (41):
(40)(41)kohises
kohi-ses
stone-sun
‘hail’kohi’
stone+ses
suntiporekpo’e
tiporek-po’e
chicken-head
‘chicken head’tiporek
chicken+-po’e
headIn general, compounds of two free nouns cannot be regarded as productive, reflected
in their special meaning. These kinds of compounds are usually fossilized. Very frequent are compounds with bound noun roots, particularly body parts, as in (41).
There are compounds of noun roots with classifiers:CHAPTER 3 - MORPHOLOGICAL PROCESSES AND WORD CLASSES(42)yakis
yaki-so
fire-CLF:stick
‘firewood’yaki
fire+97-so
CLF:stickThere are compounds derived from a verb root by attaching a classifier, which result
in a noun:
(43)konoropi
kono-ro-pi
-konowrite-ro-CLF:long&thin write
‘pencil’+-pi
CLF:long&thinThe morpheme -ro is currently unanalyzed, but it carries a function in temporal and
other subordinate relations (cf. 10.2.6). Here it may have been used as a kind of
linker. There are also many compounds with right-bound adjectives and a noun root
or classifier, as in (44) and (45):
(44)(45)čoser
čo-ser
big-tooth
‘big tooth’čobigčompe
čo-mpe
čobig-CLF:flat
big
‘big flat object (e.g. house)’+-ser
tooth+-mpe
CLF:flatThere are probably no compound verbs consisting of two verb stems. There is only
incorporation of a verb stem into specific predicate constructions (cf. 3.7).
Compounding has also created complex classifiers and grammatical morphemes.
Examples are (46) and (47):
(46)(47)pahakiš kanikon
po-ahaki-š
one-CLF:container.contents-one
‘one plate full of food’
ver pihanowapa
ver
pi=hano-wapa
PERF 2SG=be.healthy-COS
‘You are already healthy again.’kanikon
food-aha
+
CLF:container-wa
TEMP+-ki
CLF:contents
[RP-9/7/04-22]-pa
GO[DC-17/4/06-82]The classifier -ahaki- ‘(food) container contents’ (46) is composed of two other classifiers, as indicated. If only the containers are counted, only the classifier -aha- ‘container’ is attached to the numeral: pahaš nikirok ‘one plate’. Thus the meaning of the
whole has also been derived from the meaning of each element. Usually compounds
of grammatical elements have a specialized meaning, as is also the case in (47). The
change of state or changed state morpheme -wapa ‘COS’ is a fixed unit with a specificBAURE: AN ARAWAK LANGUAGE OF BOLIVIA98meaning, which is not directly derived from the meaning of the separate morphemes -wa ‘TEMP’ and -pa ‘GO’.
As mentioned in 3.3.2, the linker -a ‘LK’ is sometimes inserted between parts of
some compound, but not others, to link the two parts, as in (48) in contrast to (49):
(48)(49)tikorokapon
tikorok-a-pon
guava-LK-leaf
‘papaya tree’
porepon
pore-pon
mate-leaf
‘mate leaf’→tokorok
guava+-pon
leaf→pore’
mate+-pon
leafEven though composed of the same nominal root -pon ‘leaf’, in (48) the first nominal
root is connected by the linker -a, while in (49) the two parts are composed without
it. The linker also occurs after some incorporated nouns and classifiers (cf. 3.7), and
between grammatical morphemes. Within predicate constructions the application of
the linker is related to the difference between active and stative lexical stems (cf.
5.2), but elsewhere its occurrence cannot be predicted.
The rules for the linker could reveal more about the character of compounding
and affixation and their relation, but still needs further investigation. The linker finally also occurs in between a nominal base and a grammatical morpheme (50), or on
an adjectival base and a nominal root (51):
(50)nešari
neš-a-ri
meat-LK-NOM3
‘meat eater (carnivore)’(51)ikiyamonoe’
ikiy-a-mono-e’
middle-LK-young-EMPH
‘middle-aged’3.7. Incorporation
Incorporation is “a special case of compound formation” (Anderson 1985:6), involving a noun root or classifier and a verb. It is very productive in Baure. As mentioned
above (3.3), the insertion of classifiers may be regarded as derivational or inflectional. In general, it is the object argument that is incorporated into any kind of verb
base, as in -sipa- ‘wash’ in (52) and (53):
(52)pisipapoiyap
pi=sipa-poiy-a-po
2SG=wash-foot-LK-PRFLX
‘You wash your feet.’→-poiy
foot
[JP-20/8/03-14]CHAPTER 3 - MORPHOLOGICAL PROCESSES AND WORD CLASSES(53)nisipamirokop
ni=sipa-miro-ko-po
1SG=wash-face-ABS-PRFLX
‘I wash my face.’→99-mir
face
[JP-20/8/03-13]The two examples represent the two major types of incorporation: In (52) the noun poiy- ‘foot’ is followed by the linker -a, whereas in (53) the noun root -mir ‘face’ is
incorporated with a following absolute suffix, -ko ‘ABS’. This element is not part of
the verb base -sipa- ‘wash’ without incorporation. In other verbs this absolute suffix
is part of the base, and the incorporated noun with the linker -a is inserted exactly
into this slot. The major difference of the two incorporated arguments is presumably
that of definiteness, perfectivity, and individuation: the argument in (52) is incorporated as the complete argument, part of the action. It is definite (the feet of the subject), perfective, and individuated. In (53) the incorporated noun root -mir is rather
analyzed as a type reference, ‘the face’ as a Ground (Talmy 2000:311–344) where
the action takes place, instead of the patient that undergoes the action. This difference
can be better observed with the same nominal root in the different kinds of incorporation, as in (54) and (55):
(54)(55)raročipiaw
ro=aro-čipi-a-wo
3SGm=climb-roof-LK-COP
‘He is climbing the back of an animal.’[DC-16/3/06-21]raročipikow
ro=aro-čipi-ko-wo
3SGm=climb-roof-ABS-COP
‘He climbs (on) the roof.’[DC-16/3/06-20]The noun root -čipi ‘back, roof’ is also used as a classifier for roof-like animals.
However, here it is not analyzed as the classifier, as it refers to the back or roof itself.
In (54) the back of an animal is conceptualized as an argument. In (55), the roof of a
house is not an argument, but the Ground where the subject climbs upon. Therefore
the non-individuated incorporated noun (55) is followed by the absolute morpheme,
which is also used to derive unpossessed (generic) nouns. The same holds for incorporated classifiers, as in (56).
(56)iyowkopian
iyowko-pi-a-no
various-CLF:long&thin-LK-NOM1
‘various (e.g. snakes)’Classifiers and noun roots can be incorporated into a quantifier, as in (56), and also
into derived adjectives which are nominalized forms, as in (57). This kind resembles
the incorporation into intransitive verbs (cf. 5.4).","[114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 120, 121]"
"CHAPTER 10 - CLAUSE COMBINING AND CLAUSE EMBEDDING399If the RC has a head it can be described as an NP that modifies the head. That a “relative clause is one that functions as a nominal modifier” has already been argued by
Keenan 1985 (in Payne 1997:325). As the RC is generally postnominal, it has the
same position as the modifiers that modify a noun within an NP (cf. 4.10). The position of the RC is exactly that of a modifier, which has been brought up by Payne to
be a common parallel (cf. Payne 1997:326). Further it seems to be a common feature
of VO languages, such as Baure, to have postnominal RCs. In (50) there is a simple
modifying RC, comparable to the modifier NP in (51):

epenon
deadIn (50) the object NP nor ‘deer’ is directly modified by the RC nikasačon ‘that I
hunted’. The RC is a nominalized predicate that refers to the object and has the same
subject as the main clause, in both cases marked by ni- ‘1SG’. (51) is an example of
the object NP with a modifier epenon ‘dead’ in the same position.
Even though there is no specific relative pronoun, most relative and even complement clauses are marked by the indefinite pronoun to ka ‘something, someone’. Its
use may be obligatory in cases where the marking of the nominalized predicate is not
apparent or the RC is quite complex, but in general relative and complement clauses
that are marked by to ka can alternatively be expressed without it.
In the following sections (10.2.1–10.2.4) the different subordination types are
shown in detail, starting with the four nominalization types. Some general facts about
relativization are described in 10.2.1 but may refer to all nominalization types. Further on, the specific locative (10.2.5) and temporal (10.2.6) subordination are described. Section 10.2.7 demonstrates the cleft construction with tiow ‘this is’, and
10.2.8 makes clear how the indefinite pronoun to ka ‘something, someone’ plays a
role in relative clauses. Finally, in 10.2.9 appositions are shown to be an alternative
for modifying relative clauses.
10.2.1. Relative clauses with -no ‘NOM1’
The main nominalizers are the following: participant -no, action -čo, and product -ri.
These three nominalization types are used for RCs which refer to the core arguments
in the main clause, an event or the result of an event. In all three cases the predicate
may or may not show subject cross reference. The marking determines the semantic
relation of the relativized element and its head. If there is no subject cross-reference
on the subordinate and nominalized predicate, then the head is identical with the subject in the RC. This can be seen in (51), in which the nominalized predicate epenonBAURE: AN ARAWAK LANGUAGE OF BOLIVIA400‘dead’ may be regarded as a RC ‘that is dead’ which shows no subject marking (cf.
also (55) below). The reason is that the subject of the RC is nor ‘deer’, which is identical to the head of the RC. If there is subject cross-reference on the predicate in the
RC, then the subject in the RC is different from the head. This is demonstrated in
(50), where the RC nikasačon ‘that I hunted’ shows subject marking, because the
head nor ‘deer’ is different from the subject ni- ‘1SG’ of the RC.
There can also be object marking on the nominalized predicate of the RC. We
actually find all combinations: subject and object marking (52), subject and no object
marking (53), no subject but object marking (54), and finally neither (55). If there is
object cross-reference in the RC, then this replaces the participant nominalization
morpheme. The nominal form is thus “invisible”. Only when there is no object marking the subordination becomes apparent, otherwise it remains implicit. The object
may either be an additional object of the RC or an argument of the main clause that is
referred back to in the form of “pronoun retention” (Payne 1997:331–32). For each
kind of argument marking there are examples in (52) through (55). Relative clauses
will be shown with and without the indefinite pronoun to ka ‘something, someone’,
which generally functions as a head of the RC. There will be modifying and headless
relative clauses in the examples. The semantic role of the head in the RC is indicated
in the line above in parenthesis. The abbreviation “head=” means that the RC itself is
the head.

‘There is that witch that eats people.’401[GP-N4-39]The verb -nik- ‘eat’ has been turned into the noun nikon ‘eater’ in (55). The subject of
the RC is also the agent of this predicate derived by what I have called participant
nominalization. In the independent nominalization process for deriving nominals it is
most frequently an agentive nominalizer (cf. 5.2.4), but not exclusively. The same
morpheme has many applications and therefore it is difficult to tack down its meaning. The participant nominalizer is used in imperative, interrogative, counterfactual
conditional, and relative clauses.
Participant nominalization is the dominant way of marking a subordinate predicate. I want to stress again the change of the predicate into a nominal form. This has
the consequence that this nominal predicate can again function or be used and
marked like other nominal predicates. If we take into account what has been described in Chapter 5, then it is obvious that nominal predicates can have all morphemes attached, but the non-stative ones are linked with the morpheme -a. The copula -wo and other stative morphemes can be attached without the linker. The meaning
can be very complicated when this is applied to a relative clause. However, there was
already one example of this in (53). The predicate rimonow ‘that which she puts’ is
marked with the copula suffix -wo. The meaning of the copula in that example is not
clear to me, though it may be related to stative aspect.
(56) is an example of a nominalized predicate in a relative clause with subject
marking and a non-stative morpheme attached: -pik ‘COME’, preceded by the
linker -a.

[RP-N3-15]The preceding examples were exclusively of verbal predicates in the RCs, but also
non-verbal predicates can, less frequently, be the predicate in the RC. There are only
a few examples, however, as generally the RC refers to some type of active event and
non-verbal predicates are stative. The following example (57) is part of a longer sentence that introduces the characters in a narrative. I consider kotišen ne’ ‘this size’ to
be a RC, but if the adverb ne’ was missing it could not be distinguished from a simple modifier juxtaposed to its noun referent teč rišir ‘her son’.

it is not a subordinator. In (58) the non-verbal predicate in the RC in the question is

nominalization has to change the form of the predicate, and second, non-verbal
predicates are almost always intransitive. If there were marking of a subject, then this
would be done with an enclitic, which obeys different rules than the proclitic on
verbs and is not obligatory. Even though it could be possible that a non-verbal predicate occurs in a RC that refers to an object head, I cannot find such an example in the
data.
10.2.2. Relative clauses with -čo ‘NOM2’
The action nominalizer -čo ‘NOM2’ creates action nouns from verbs and is used for
relativization and complementation. It is the second most common morpheme in subordination, but more often it occurs in complementation than in relative clause formation. In some cases it is impossible to distinguish complement from RC constructions. In general, the determiner preceding the nominalized predicate has been taken
as a characteristic of a RC construction, in contrast to the complement construction,
which may include a determiner as well, but also occurs without it. There is a clear
relation between the two.
The predicate nominalized with -čo ‘NOM2’ is generally marked with a subject
proclitic, but there are also examples with object marking and both, subject and object marking, or neither. There is no example of the nominalized predicate with only
object marking. There are examples of the different kinds of argument marking in

"4. The noun and the noun phrase
In this chapter Baure nominal morphology and the noun phrase (NP) are addressed.
Nouns function as heads of NPs, arguments in a clause. As there are different kinds
of nominal roots, the chapter will be structured as follows: first the bound and free
common nouns are described, including the inherent grammatical categories of nouns
in 4.1–4.3. After a general definition of the boundaries of noun root, stem and base
(4.1), I turn to the categories gender (4.2) and possession (4.3). Then the specific
nominal morphology of the noun base is analyzed in 4.4–4.6. This involves number
marking, diminutive and augmentative, and compounding. Then a description of operations within the noun phrase follows in 4.7–4.10. In this part other specific nominal roots are introduced: classifying noun roots and classifiers in 4.7, locative noun
roots in 4.8, and modifying noun roots in 4.9. Noun classification, locative constructions, and nominal modification are based on compounding with specific kinds of
nominal roots. One part of the nominal modifiers are adjectives, defined as a subgroup of nouns in 3.8.3. Even though adjectives are basically nominal, they have
some specific semantic and morphological characteristics that distinguish them from
common nouns, as discussed in 4.8.4 and 4.8.5. Modification, studied in 4.10, only
refers to NP operations. Other uses of modifiers, such as predicates (cf. 5.2) and the
comparative construction (cf. 5.5), are treated elsewhere in the grammar. Determiners
are important grammatical constituents of the NP, analyzed in 8.2.
4.1. Noun roots, stems and bases
The noun in Baure minimally consists of a root, but there are the possible extensions
of a noun stem and a base. The noun root (4.1.1) is the most basic lexical element of
a noun and unanalyzable. Most nominal roots are disyllabic or trisyllabic (cf. 2.4.2).
The root carries part of the semantic contents, but may be modified by adding one or
two more noun roots (compound, cf. 4.6) or a classifier (cf. 4.7). In addition there is a
small class of lexical suffixes that can be attached to the root. The stem (4.1.2) may
be identical with the root, but as Baure is a compounding (or polysynthetic) language,
the meaning of a noun is very often composed of more than only the basic lexical
element. This extension is called the stem. The noun base finally (4.1.3), is the unit to
which all other nominal morphemes are added. Even though in the majority of cases
the base is identical to the stem, there may be further extensions, especially due to the
fact that possession can be a marked category in Baure. The composition of the noun
base is represented in Figure 4.2. Specific kinds of noun roots are described in the
appropriate sections (4.7 – 4.9).
The citation form for nouns used in this grammar is the noun base; and a distinction will be made between bound forms – with a hyphen in the place where the possessor clitic is attached, as e.g. in -weri ‘house, home’ – and free forms – without a
hyphen as they can stand alone, as e.g. pari ‘house’.
4.1.1. Noun roots
The majority of noun roots are disyllabic or trisyllabic, but there are also a few
monosyllabic roots. There are some nominal roots with more than three syllables, of
which the majority include reduplicated syllables. Phonologically many disyllabicBAURE: AN ARAWAK LANGUAGE OF BOLIVIA112nouns appear as monosyllabic with a heavy syllable, because with the frequent final
vowel elision one syllable is dropped (cf. 2.4). The noun roots do not include the possessor clitics, which are obligatorily attached to bound nouns, for which reason these
clitics are excluded from the phonological analysis of the requirements of a noun
root. The phonetic structure of a noun root is represented in Figure 4.1:
(-)(C)VCV[CV]
Figure 4.1: Basic phonetic structure of a noun rootOnly very few noun roots are monosyllabic (cf. Table 4.3). However, classifiers are
nominal roots as well, and grammatical classifiers are mainly monosyllabic. But
these particular roots are generally neither used as free forms, nor only with a possessor proclitic. They have to be bound to another nominal root (noun, adjective, numeral or verb). A few monosyllabic and disyllabic noun roots may function as classifiers as well (cf. 4.7). Among the few monosyllabic noun roots there are less bound
forms (obligatorily possessed) than free forms. There is at least one bound noun root
that only consists of one vowel, -a’ ‘body’. Free forms have the structure CV – as na’
‘egg’ – or CVV with a complex vowel, a diphthong – as nia’ ‘rainbow’ or poe’ ‘axe’.
Table 2.11 already represented all of the forms with monosyllabic nominal roots that
could be detected. Table 4.1 shows examples of bound and free disyllabic noun roots:

fireTable 4.1: Disyllabic noun rootsAccording to the phonotactics described in 2.4, we also have to include roots with the
disyllabic ones, which phonologically seem to have only one syllable. This is e.g. the
case with noun roots such as -ah ‘soup’ or hir ‘man’, for which there must be an underlying final vowel o presupposed (cf. 2.2.1). This means that the underlying forms
are *-aho and *hiro, which are disyllabic. The orthography, however, represents the
pronunciation rather than the underlying system.
Those roots terminating in the vowel i undergo word final devoicing of the vowel
and the palatalization of the preceding consonant (cf. 2.2.2), so that phonologically
they also come out as if they consisted of only one syllable. This accounts for nounCHAPTER 4 - THE NOUN AND THE NOUN PHRASE113roots such as aki [akj] ‘lagoon’, ani [a] ‘sky’, -čipi [tipj] and many others. However, the deletion of the final vowel o and the devoicing of the final vowel i are phonological processes which do not occur when other morphemes are added after the
root. Therefore the noun root -tip ‘nail, claw’ becomes -tipo-nev ‘nails, claws’ when
the plural morpheme is attached, or the noun root -čipi ‘roof’ becomes -čipi-ye
['tpi-j] when the locative morpheme is attached (for more details cf. Chapter 2).
Noun roots with three syllables are also very frequent. There may be slightly
more free trisyllabic roots than bound ones. Table 4.2 lists trisyllabic noun roots:

Even though I found some bound roots with more than three syllables, I suppose
these have been derived or they are loan words. In Table 4.3 some noun roots are
summed up that possibly have more than three basic syllables as an unanalyzable
form. Nevertheless, some of the listed examples have to be regarded as doubtful
cases, as is discussed below.

"CHAPTER 8 - CLOSED WORD CLASSES3198.3.3. Personal pronouns
The free personal pronouns have been derived from the clitics by attachment of the
morpheme -ti’. Compare the forms in Table 8.9 to the free forms of Table 8.10:
PERSONNUMBER
SINGULAR1
2
3 feminine
3 masculinenti’
piti’
riti’
roti’PLURAL
viti’
yiti’
noti’Table 8.10: The independent personal pronounsIn the 1SG the morpheme ni- has been reduced into n-, which results in the voicing of
-t in nti’ [ndi]. The morpheme -ti’ closely resembles the feminine demonstrative ti
‘DEM1f’. Even though the masculine form ro- is used for general reference and the
feminine only for biological feminine gender, the feminine demonstrative seems to
have served as the basis for the general form in this derivational process (cf. the earlier discussion about gender reversal in Baure). The demonstrative ti also occurs in
the cleft particle tiow ‘this is’ (cf. 10.2.7). The form ti in the free personal pronouns is
reanalyzed as the demonstrative by the speakers, supported by the occasional alternative use of other demonstratives instead, as e.g. the consultant Estéban Chipeno used
roteč in elicitation instead of roti’ ‘3SGm‘.
The free pronouns are only used for special emphasis (40) or in clauses without
any person marking on a non-verbal predicate for disambiguation and emphasis (41):

‘She said she didn’t like him because he was adopted.’
[LO/GP-D-22]In (40) the pronoun piti’ replaces the enclitic -pi, since a clitic cannot be emphasized.
In (41) the non-verbal predicate could carry person cross-reference in the form kariačsino-wo=ro (adopted-COP=3SGm) ‘he is adopted’. In general statements the juxtaposition of pronoun and attributive predicate is favoured.
8.3.4. Possessive pronouns
The possessive pronouns have been derived from the personal pronouns by attachment of a morpheme -ro, such as e.g. piti-r(o) ‘your’ (2SG). It is unclear where this
suffix originated. Matteson (1972:162) argues for a general marker for possession in
Arawak languages, which has the form -ri. However, in Baure there is no evidence
for such a possession marker, but the suffix that produced the possessive pronounsBAURE: AN ARAWAK LANGUAGE OF BOLIVIA320may still go back to a Proto-Arawak formative. Possessive pronouns are demonstrated in Table 8.11:

pronouns. They are mainly used in possessive constructions with Spanish loanwords
(cf. 4.3.2) and a few nouns that cannot be used in a derived possessed form with a
personal proclitic. Further the possessive forms are also found to mark a specific semantic role of an argument in certain constructions. This usage seems to be a more
recent development, as it cannot be observed in the data of Baptista & Wallin. In
these clauses the possessive pronoun is generally followed by the personal pronoun,
as in (42) and (43).

him
fishpitir piti’
2SGP 2SG
[RP-21/7/04-37]In both examples the possessive pronoun seems to mark a semantic role different
from agent and patient. In (42) the reason for this special marking seems to be a restriction on the transitivity of the verb -hino’inok- ‘think’, which can probably only
take a non-human object. In (43) the argument pitir piti’ refers to the recipient, a role
that can also be the direct object of a benefactive verb base. The speaker uses this
construction instead of the benefactive derivation (already mentioned in 1.2.4).
As Baure has grammaticalized the marking of possessors by procliticization, the
possessive pronoun has been reanalyzed as a possessed noun, as e.g. ro-tir ‘his’,
which can be analyzed as 3SGm=*possession. Thus these pro-forms are frequently
used like nominals with a preceding determiner and as real pronouns for the noun
referred to. The noun -tir is also translated as ‘doll’ that a child is playing with, as in
example (44):
(44)niporoč to ntir.
ni=poro-čo

[RP-22/7/04-46]CHAPTER 8 - CLOSED WORD CLASSES321This nominal base can also be used as the non-verbal predicate ‘possess’ in affirmative clauses (cf. 5.3.5 and 8.3.4 below).
8.3.5. Personal and possessive pronominal bases
Personal pronouns can be used as the base of adverbs. These adverbial forms are derived with the help of the absolutive suffix -ko and generally the reduplication of the
morpheme -ti, but they are always used in the emphatic form (cf. 8.1.4 on adverbial
morphology). An example is rotitikoe’ (45), which can be translated as ‘he all alone’
or ‘only him’.

‘And she left the child all alone there in the room.’[RP-N4-2]This derived adverb can also be used as a non-verbal predicate with and without the
reduplicated syllable. The emphatic morpheme is attached predicate finally, thus also
after the copular suffix -wo (46) or another verbal morpheme (47).

may be the copula or another verbal morpheme attached, as in (48) and (49):
(48)(49)nakirok-ye to čintinev nka notirow yaki.

‘They wanted to have it, but he already came to look for them.’[RP-N6-3]This use of the pronouns as non-verbal bases resembles the way any noun or other
non-verbal base is used as a predicate. In (49) there is even subject marking by encliticization on the predicate.
8.3.6. The indefinite pronoun
The indefinite pronoun to ka is used in many fixed expressions, and its meaning is
not always clear. It is mainly used as a relative pronoun (cf. 10.2.8), but the pronoun
to ka (ART IND) is translated as ‘something/somebody’. It may be negated as nka to ka
(NEG ART IND) ‘nothing/nobody’, a complex form consisting of three particles. The
form ka is marked by the article to. This form is also found in the plural demonstrative pronouns to neč ‘DEM2PL’ and to nen ‘DEM3PL’ (cf. Table 8.8). The complex
negative form is frequently used as a negative existential with nka ‘NEG’ as the negative existential predicate ‘there is not’ in juxtaposition with to ka ‘something’. In (50)
and (51) there are examples:

"30BAURE: AN ARAWAK LANGUAGE OF BOLIVIA1.4.3. The structural features of Baure: genetic and areal features
Geographically Baure belongs to the Amazonian region. Amazonia is generally defined as the “region including the two Guianas, most of the Amazon basin of Brazil,
and some eastern portions of Bolivia, Columbia, and Peru” (Derbyshire & Pullum
1986:1). Amazonia is probably “the most complex linguistic area in the world today”
(Dixon & Aikhenvald 1999:2) with approximately 300 languages that belong to 20
language families and around 12 isolates (Dixon & Aikhenvald 1999:2). There have
been people living in Amazonia for thousands of years, and because of the many different languages, it is not surprising that “[m]ultilingualism was (and is) the norm
among the Indian tribes of Amazonia” (Dixon & Aikhenvald 1999:5). Ethnic groups
in Amazonia share a lot of their culture and history. Since the time of colonization we
can observe the decimation or extinction of many Amazonian groups due to imported
diseases, enslavement and maltreatment. In the time of the rubber boom (as mentioned in 1.1.3) the whole area was affected by strong migration and the exploitation
of many indigenous people, which altogether led to language diffusion and death
(Dixon & Aikhenvald 1999:6). Many linguists (among these Derbyshire & Pullum
1986 and Dixon & Aikhenvald 1999) have come to the conclusion that Amazonia can
be regarded as a linguistic area, defined as “a region including languages from several genetic groups, with the languages sharing certain symptomatic features which
can be inferred to have diffused across the area” (Dixon & Aikhenvald 1999:8). Derbyshire & Pullum (1986:1) even argue that “Amazonian languages share a wide
range of similarities in grammatical and phonological structure that transcend currently genetic groupings”, and Dixon & Aikhenvald (1999:16) claim that we ought to
understand that probably for the Amazonian region the family tree model does not
hold after all. That means that it is important to consider areal features in addition to
the features of languages within the Arawak language family. The shared features of
Amazonian languages have been listed from two different perspectives. While Derbyshire & Pullum (1986:19) mainly list syntactic and pragmatic features, Dixon &
Aikhenvald (1999:8–9) have analyzed phonological and morphological features.
The grammar of Baure tallies with many of the Amazonian features, though not
all. In most cases Amazonian features correspond to Arawak features, because the
majority of Arawak languages are also Amazonian and have therefore also added to
the generalizations of the linguistic area. In addition, the authors (Dixon & Aikhenvald 1999) may also have taken Arawak languages into consideration to a greater
degree than other languages because of their own research interests. Thus Baure
shares the following features with Amazonian areal as well as with Arawak genetic
features:
Phonology:
(a) only one rounded vowel o or u
(b) only one liquid
Morphology:
(c) polysynthetic, head-marking, agglutinating with little fusion
(d) extensive classifier system
(e) noun incorporationCHAPTER 1 - INTRODUCTION31(f) no extensive case system
(g) verb agreement with S and O: thus many clauses with only a predicate
(h) mainly suffixing
Morphosyntax:
(i) split ergative or split stative system concerning argument marking
(j) subordination involves nominalized verbs
Lexicon:
(k) nouns distinguished for alienable/inalienable possession
(l) small class of lexical numbers
In addition to these areal (and genetic) features there are some Arawak features that
Baure shows, which cannot be argued to be Amazonian areal features. These are unstable stops (frequently palatalized) and the avoidance of consonant clusters in the
phonology. Furthermore, Amazonian languages tend to incorporate nouns or other
lexical material before the verb root, whereas at least in South Arawak languages
(Aikhenvald 1999:86) and in Baure they follow the root. It may still be questionable
if the predominant constituent order in Amazonia is in fact object before subject (cf.
Derbyshire & Pullum 1986:17–18), because the authors also counted Baure wrongly
as an instance of VOS order (cf. Chapter 9).
It is striking that Baure never disagrees with any Amazonian features that would
hold for Arawak languages. This shows that the genetic relationship is very clear, but
it cannot really be argued that Baure shows any more Amazonian areal features than
Arawak languages do in general.
On the other hand, there are a number of characteristics of Baure disagreeing with
both Amazonian areal and Arawak genetic features. There are for example no phonemically long vowels in Baure, nor do nasalization or glottalization play a major
role in the Baure phonology. The order possessor–possessed is found internally by
cross-reference of the possessor on the head noun in Baure (like in other Arawak
languages), but externally Baure uses partitive constructions of the form to tawe’ to
monči’ (ART ball ART child) ‘the ball of the child/ the child’s ball’, in which the possessed NP is juxtaposed and precedes the possessor NP. Conjunctions are not explicitly mentioned in Arawak generalizations, the most dominant features for subordination being nominalization and verb serialization. In Baure, however, there are many
clause combining and constituent combining conjunctions (called connectors in this
grammar, cf. Chapter 10), alongside with the possibilities of clause juxtaposition,
serial verbs and predicate chains, and complement constructions. Even though Baure
also shows a kind of split system, its characteristics do not coincide with those of the
ergative or stative split systems of other Amazonian and Arawak languages. There is
a split in argument marking in Baure, but it seems to be governed by word class
rather than by verb semantics, such as active and stative (cf. Danielsen & Granadillo
2007).
These deviations could be Baure specific features, but it is also possible that they
are shared by other languages of the area. Recent research (Crevels & van der Voort,
in press) has shown that a new linguistic area can be established between the Mamoré
and the Guaporé (Iténez) rivers, extending further into Rondônia (Brasil). It remains32BAURE: AN ARAWAK LANGUAGE OF BOLIVIAto be investigated how Baure tallies with the features of this linguistic sub-area in
Amazonia.
1.5. The structure of the book
After this introduction there is a description of the Baure phonology, phonotactics,
and morphophonology in Chapter 2. Chapter 3 describes the general morphological
processes and the different parts of speech. Chapter 4 deals with the nominal morphology and noun phrase operations. In Chapter 5 the main predicate types are discussed, including incorporation and specific non-verbal predicate constructions,
whereas specific verbal morphology is described in 6. Chapter 7 shows another important part of verb phrases: preverbal particles. In 8 adverbs and other closed classes
are discussed. Chapters 9 and 10 treat the Baure syntax, referring to word order and
clause types in 9, and clause combinations in 10. Some additional information, such
as word lists and text data are given in the Appendix.","[51, 52, 53, 54]"

Baure is spoken in northeast Bolivia, in the Bolivian part of Amazonia. It is a South
Arawak language (according to the classification of Aikhenvald 1999:67–71, and cf.
Figure 1.1)1. Today it is a seriously endangered language (cf. Crevels 2002:21). The
Arawak language family was once very large, spanning from the Carib islands down
to the Andean foothills of Peru and to Bolivian and Brazilian Amazonia, into northern Argentina and Paraguay, including up to 150 languages. Today there is only
about a fourth of these languages left, the others having been replaced by Spanish or
Portuguese. In the next years many of the endangered Arawak languages will have
been replaced and soon only a handful of those with greater speaker numbers will
remain, if any. This background of language decay and death calls for linguists to try
to at least document and study the last remains of these languages. Each language
also offers an insight to a specific image of the world and the categorization of items,
so that the loss of a language means also losing some knowledge about human nature.
The interest in less well studied languages and the urgent need to study them have
been my main concern when writing this grammar of Baure.
The aim of this book is to provide a grammatical description of the Baure language in the form of a detailed reference grammar, which allows linguists to compare
it to other Arawak languages, and that gives linguists from all backgrounds insights
into the phonological and morphosyntactic processes that we find in this specific language. For this practical reason, particular technical terminology has been avoided
where possible.
This chapter sketches the general historical background of the region where the
Baure people live (1.1). It focuses on the study and status of the Baure language earlier in history and today (1.2). In 1.3 the field research necessary for this new corpus
of linguistic data, the consultants, the field site and the kind of data storage are described. Baure can be categorized as an Arawak language genetically, as well as an
Amazonian language in a specific linguistic area, as discussed in 1.4. In 1.5 the structure of the present study is described.
1.1 Historical Background
The Baures live in the department Beni in the north-east of Bolivia, in a geographical
area called the Llanos de Moxos (Moxos Plains). This name derives from one of the
major ethnic groups, the Moxos, whose languages Trinitario and Ignaciano (both
generally referred to by the name Moxo or Mojo) also belong to the Arawak language family. The history of the people of this region is divided here into the following five rough periods and turning points: the prehispanic time (1.1.1), the time of the
Jesuits and thereafter (1.1.2), the rubber boom (1.1.3), the mid-20th century with important educational reforms (1.1.4), and the time of growing indigenous awareness
and politicization, expressed by an indigenous movement starting in the 1990s
(1.1.5).","[14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23]"

that can also be found in other Arawak languages is the word for ‘house’, which
is -wer in the possessed form in Baure, but the unpossessed form is pari. This means
that *ropari (3SGm=house) ‘his house’ is ungrammatical. None of the two forms
undergoes any kind of derivation. Therefore *werik ‘house’ is ungrammatical, and so
is *ewer ‘house of someone’ or *roparin (3SGm=house-POSS) ‘his house’. This is
again illustrated in (12):
(12)but:possessed

kinship terms are not derived as unpossessed forms. In these examples the unpossessed forms are vocative forms and are only used when addressing or greeting
someone. This does not hold for -šečenev ‘children, sons’ and ahinev ‘children’.
The majority of nouns belong to the class of optionally possessed nouns. Some of
these nouns are used as free forms, but can have a possessor marker procliticized as
well without any formal change. This is demonstrated in example (13):
(13)unpossessed
hačkis
→
hačkis
glasses
‘a pair of glasses’possessed
nihačkis
ni=hačkis
1SG=glasses
‘my glasses’Along with this zero derivation (or ambiguous forms in respect to possession) there is
a suffix that derives possessed forms. This morpheme is -no ‘POSS’, which is homophonous with the nominalizer -no ‘NOM1’, a multifunctional morpheme (cf. 5.2.4,
9.4, 10.2.1), and may also be considered to be identical with it. Examples of this
derivation are -romon ‘chief’ (< rom) or -yakison ‘fire wood’ (< yakis) in (14). In this
derivational process some nouns show a vowel change in the first syllable of the
noun base. In the examples I found this change was an opening of the rounded vowel
o into the unrounded vowel a, as e.g. nihapin ‘my jar’ (< hopi) in (15).

refers to the specific animal is preceded by a more general inalienably possessed
noun -per ‘domesticated animal’. Observe this solution of possessor marking in (16)
and (17):

dogsimori
pigThe noun -per ‘domesticated animal’ functions as a nominal modifier in (16) and
(17), a function that a few nouns can have (compare the use of hir ‘man (male)’ in
example (7) above).
Some other non-possessable nouns are preceded by the possessive pronoun instead of personal proclitic, identical to the way Spanish loans are marked for possession (cf. 4.3.2).
4.3.2. Possession of Spanish loans
Spanish loanwords are generally treated like non-possessable nouns, even when they
refer to kinship. This does not hold for all Spanish loans, as some of them have already been incorporated into the Baure language system, but it is certainly true for all
recent loans. Even though there is a Baure word for ‘grandmother’ -os or ‘grandfather’ -ašok, nowadays the Spanish loan avoel (from Spanish abuelo/a) is used much
more frequently111. It is, however, not possible for this borrowed kinship noun to be
simply marked with the possessor proclitic. Here the possessive pronouns are used
instead, as illustrated in (18):
(18)totiARTntir avoel
1SGP grandparent
‘my grandfather’DEM1f 1SGPntiravoel
grandparent
‘my grandmother’The possessive NPs consist of a determiner, the possessive pronoun and the noun.
The article is used only for male referents and the demonstrative, marked for feminine gender, is used for female referents. The possessive pronoun precedes the noun
just like the personal prefixes, but they have to be considered as independent elements in the construction, rather comparable to nominal modifiers like -per ‘domesticated animal’ in (16) and (17). Some non-possessable nouns that can logically be
111This may also have to do with the fact that the gender division in Baure kinship terms (one general
gender form plus two specific forms, sometimes dependent on the sex of the speaker, cf. 4.1.2) is so
different from the Spanish system that it is not as transparent for bilinguals as it used to be for
monolinguals.","[143, 144, 145, 146]"
"9. Clause types and utterance structures
In this chapter different clause types are introduced, while the following Chapter 10
focuses on clause combinations. As a basis for the analysis of clause types and argument structure I considered different text types: dialogues, narratives and personal
stories, and not predominantly the examples from elicitation. In the beginning of the
chapter a simple clause is defined and the possible constituent orders of the core arguments are demonstrated. Then further optional clause constituents are mentioned
and their typical places of occurrences are identified. Negative clauses are illustrated
in 9.2. Specific types of predicate clauses were already demonstrated in Chapter 5 on
predicate types. One specific clause type that is described in this section is the imperative clause (9.3). The various kinds of interrogative constructions constitute another type of non-declarative clause (9.4). The answers to questions may be more
reduced than simple declarative clauses, and they are described in 9.5. Finally,
clauses in narratives and conversation show some specific characteristics with the
attachment of clausal enclitics and the repetition of predicates or parts of the utterace.
The most important strategies are shown in 9.6 and 9.7.
9.1. The structure of simple clauses and order of the core arguments
A simple clause in Baure consists of minimally a predicate. This predicate may be
verbal or non-verbal (cf. Chapter 5). By reason of the cross-referencing strategies,
clauses with only a predicate, but no explicit arguments, are relatively frequent. Here
are examples of simple clauses consisting of only a predicate, verbal predicates in (1)
and (2), and a non-verbal predicate in (3):
(1)(2)(3)rokospot. rokačpow.

‘She killed it.’[GP-N1/I-11]veraperi.
ver-a-pa=ri
PERF-LK-GO=3SGf
‘She (already) left.’[RP-N4-77]The clauses in (1) both consist of only an intransitive predicate each, marked by the
subject proclitic ro- ‘3SGm’. In 11.3 predicate chains of the type in (1) are shown to
be a technique used very frequently for a chronological sequence of events. The
clause in (2) contains a transitive predicate marked for subject (ri- ‘3SGf’) and object
(-ro ‘3SGm’). Therefore both arguments may be present without explicit NPs. The
order of the arguments predicate-internally can be analyzed as S-V-O, which is not
identical to the preferred argument order of explicit arguments (see further below in
this section). In general, most verbs are ambitransitive, i.e. they can be used as anBAURE: AN ARAWAK LANGUAGE OF BOLIVIA332intransitive verb, but also as a transitive verb. The specific verb -ikomorik- ‘kill’ in
(2) is one of the few exceptions. This verb is obligatorily transitive and could not
occur without an object. Example (3) shows a non-verbal predicate which is used
frequently, formed on the base of the adverb ver ‘already’ (PERF). In (3) the predicate
is marked by an enclitic -ri ‘3SGf’ that refers to the subject. If there is no explicit NP
that refers to the subject the predicate generally has to be marked. With a subject NP,
on the other hand, it may occur in simple juxtaposition (cf. 9.1.1).
In addition to the predicate there may be up to three core arguments depending on
the kind of predicate base: a subject argument may be found with any predicate, an
object argument when the predicate is transitive, and two object arguments when the
predicate is ditransitive. The core arguments may be found being marked on the
predicate (as in (1)–(3) above), but they may also be represented by an NP or pronoun as explicit arguments. This section shows how the explicit core arguments are
related to the predicate and in which order they may appear. The main distinctions in
word order possibilities I found concern the difference between argument of an intransitive and a transitive predicate, the distinction between subject and object argument, but also whether the explicit argument is a complete NP or a simple pronoun.
A further minor distinction is animate versus inanimate, as will be shown below.
Some word order distinctions may be related to focus and topicalization. As this
grammar does not explicitly discuss these pragmatic features separately, there will be
brief reference to them in the sections where necessary. The general argument order
is demonstrated in Figure 9.1:
PRED(S)(O)Figure 9.1: Argument order with explicit core argumentsThe predicate (PRED) is in initial position, optionally followed by the explicit subject
(S) and an explicit object (O). The reason why this has not been called VSO in the
figure is to include non-verbal predicates as well.
9.1.1. The subject argument
In general the subject of an intransitive predicate follows the predicate, as demonstrated in (4). However, a transitive verb may also be followed by only one argument
that refers to the object, so that we cannot determine subjecthood on the basis of the
position alone. In this respect (4) is contrasted with (5):
(4)(5)roharow to yakis.
ro=haro-wo

3SGm=burn.intr-COP
ART
‘The firewood is burning.’yakis
firewoodrokow to yakis.
ro=kow
to
yakis
3SGm=burn.tr
ART
firewood
‘He is burning the firewood.’[RP-5/7/04-62][RP-5/7/04-63]The verb -har- ‘burn’ is intransitive and refers to the burning material as a subject, as
represented in (4), in which to yakis ‘the firewood’ is the explicit subject NP. TheCHAPTER 9 - CLAUSE TYPES AND UTTERANCE STRUCTURES333clause in (5) looks nearly identical in its structure, but the different verb -kow- ‘burn’
is transitive and the explicit NP refers to the object in this example. The different role
of the explicit argument is not apparent from either the position of the argument or
the cross-reference on the verb when there is only one explicit argument.
The order VSO is generally preferred, especially when no human argument is
involved. In the following example a speaker corrected the order to VSO, when I
tried to express it in VOS:
(6)(7)*V
*nonik
no=nik
3PL=eatO

ro=soki

3PL=eat ART bird
ART
3SGm=seed
‘The birds eat the seeds (of a tree).’[JC-13/7/04-96]In narratives, however, I also found examples with VOS order, particularly when
there is a human or animate argument involved, so that the roles of the arguments can
be understood from the context. In (8) the agent teč šiye’ ‘the fox’ is animate and a
main character in the narrative.

DEM2m
fox
[RP-N3-95]For special emphasis the subject NP frequently precedes the predicate. This mainly
accounts for verbal predicates (especially transitive ones) and is found when the subject changes. As there are no other switch-reference markers, the position of the subject is the pragmatic means of marking the change of the subject.

[RP-N2/II-37]Nominal NPs should be distinguished from pronominal NPs. If the subject is referred
to by a pronoun, the pronoun generally precedes the predicate. The personal pronouns are used for special emphasis, which is why they often precede the predicate.

(O)Figure 9.2: Argument order with pronominal subject NPs and subjects in focusBAURE: AN ARAWAK LANGUAGE OF BOLIVIA334Personal pronouns are not used frequently, and there are more examples with the
speech act participants, especially nti’ ‘1SG’ and piti’ ‘2SG’ than there are with 3SG or
3PL pronouns. (10) and (11) are examples:
(10)(11)“noka!” rokičowor-hi, “koe’ piti’ pinikoni!”

1SG tomorrow 1SG=work
‘I work tomorrow.’pi=niko=ni
2SG=eat=1SG
[RP-N3-118][RP-N11-13]In (10) the pronoun piti’ ‘2SG’ precedes the verb pinikoni ‘you eat me’, in which the
subject is also marked by the proclitic pi- ‘2SG’. It is also possible to find an adverb
in between the subject pronoun and the verb, as shown in (11). This is also the position of the negative particle nka when the predicate is negated.
In the case of non-verbal predicates in juxtaposition with the subject NP (cf. 5.3.1
and 5.3.2), it seems to be the unmarked case when the subject pronoun precedes the
predicate. This also means that when the pronoun follows the predicate, this puts
special emphasis on the predicate, as in (12):
(12)“monik piti’, čapak,” rokičowor-hi.

ro=kičo-wo=ro=hi

2SG spider
3SGm=say.do-COP-3SGm=QUOT
‘ “You are pretty, spider”, he said.’[SIL-N1-56]Even though preverbal particles have much in common with adverbs in general, subject personal pronouns tend to occur after a preverbal particle, thus in between the
particle and the main verb, as in (13). The same holds for complement constructions
(as described in 11.3.4), which must have been the source of preverbal particle constructions as well, so that it is not surprising that the constructions are similar.

[JP-N9-20]9.1.2. The object arguments
In Baure there are two possible object arguments, generally referred to as “direct”
and “indirect” in the linguistic literature. However, which one is the “direct” or “indirect” depends on being human or not, not on any kind of “directness”. In general the
concepts of recipient and patient are used in this grammar to classify the objects semantically. In addition there are oblique objects, which are discussed in 9.1.3. Usually a verb occurs together with only one object NP. The object NP follows the verb
(cf. (5)), and generally also the subject NP (7). Therefore VSO is the least markedCHAPTER 9 - CLAUSE TYPES AND UTTERANCE STRUCTURES335situation. In (14) an example is added with one subject NP and one object NP,
whereas in (15) there are two explicit object NPs.

3SGf=read=3SGm
‘I want to give the book to my sister so that she reads it.’[RP-P1-1]In (15) there are two explicit object NPs, related to the ditransitive verb -pa- ‘give’.
The order is patient – O(P) – before recipient – O(R) –, which is exactly the inverse
from the fixed order of personal enclitics on the verb (cf. 5.1.3 and Figure 5.1). Two
enclitics are only attached if one of them is a speech act participant, but the order is
then always recipient before patient, as e.g. in nipapir (1SG=give=2SG=3SGm) ‘I give
it to you’.
It is also possible to antepose an explicit object argument to the predicate for special emphasis. In general, the position directly following the predicate can also be
used to emphasize the object argument (at least with human agents, as shown in (8)),
but especially with causative verbs, where the object is identical to the causee, i.e. the
real agent of the action, the object NP can be anteposed to the whole predicate. This
downplays the role of the causer as the actual subject of the construction, as in (16):

narratives and conversation there are only two examples of pronouns referring to an
object. In one case the object pronoun follows the predicate (17), which seems to be
the least marked position. In (18) there is an example of the object pronoun preceding
the predicate, but it should rather be considered as a case of left-dislocation for pragmatic purposes, as the pronoun is followed by a short pause.

The main kind of oblique argument is the locative NP marked by the locative suffix -ye. Besides this there is sometimes an unmarked NP added as if it were an object
NP, but in fact this is an oblique argument that refers to a cause. This is analyzed as a
kind of juxtaposition, especially because the causal NP is frequently a nominalized
predicat. This is described in 10.2.4. In this section only locative arguments are described. The locative argument is treated like other locative or temporal adverbials,
and the position is more free than that of the arguments of the predicate. The least
marked order is considered to be the one following the main arguments. In (19) the
locative argument follows the object NP:

1PL=put-GO firewood field-LOC
‘We will bring the firewood to the field.’[JC-13/8/03-3]For emphasis on the location there are two strategies: the locative NP occurs in leftdislocation, as in (20), or the location occurs directly after the predicate, as in (21).

‘The frog went away to his cave.’[RP-N2/I-16]In the left-dislocation in (20) the main clause follows the locative argument without
any further changes in the order predicate-subject. In (21) the locative argument follows directly after the verb, and the subject follows after the location. The locative
argument frequently follows verbs of motion that already imply a location, but less
frequently a subject NP follows the location.
The locative argument can also be more complex with a possessive NP that is
simply juxtaposed to the location without any further marking (22). This may also
play a role in respect to the restriction of main arguments following the locative argument. Consider example (22):CHAPTER 9 - CLAUSE TYPES AND UTTERANCE STRUCTURES(22)V

[RP-N4-81]The verbs in (21) and (22) and other verbs of motion are generally intransitive. With
transitive verbs the subject NP usually does not occur after the location, but object
NPs follow frequently, as in (23):

example:
(24)V

In (24) it is apparent that for focus on the location in the first clause the subject NP ti
nihin ‘my daughter’ can follow the location, but in the following two clauses the
more general order of the arguments is used, namely LOC-predicate-subject.
Finally, there may also be two locative arguments following another, one specifying the other, as in (25):

In Baure there are two main strategies of negation: one involves particles that precede
the negated element (periphrastic negation), and the other one the privative prefix
mo- (morphological negation). Periphrastic negation is the general way to negate
propositions; morphological negation is not used so productively and cannot negate
every verb, but only a restricted number of lexicalized verbs, nouns, and adjectives
(cf. 4.9.3 and 5.2.3).
Starting with periphrastic negation, there are at least four different negative particles: nka ‘no(t)’, porok ‘never’, verek ‘not ever’, and wokow ‘not yet’. All of these
particles have a different etymology and are described one by one. What they all have
in common is the fixed position preceding the verb or non-verbal predicate. In this
and other respects negative particles are just like the other preverbal particles described in Chapter 7. So we have the negation pattern NEG PRED.
The negative particle precedes the negated element directly. There is a hierarchy
in the specificity of the negative particles: nka is the general negative particle, and the
others − porok ‘never’, verek ‘not ever’, and wokow ‘not yet’ are more specific.
9.2.1. The general negative particle n(o)ka
The particle that occurs most is the general negative particle n(o)ka ‘no(t)’. The phonological form ranges from the most clearly pronounced [noka], over the generally
used forms [nga] or [ga], to the emphatic forms [doka] or [daka]211. [nga] is the
product of first the elision of the vowel [o] and a subsequent voicing of the obstruent
[k] into [g] that follows the syllabic nasal (cf. 2.2.1 and 2.5.1). The emphatic forms
[doka] or [daka] show a phonological process that is not all too common in Baure:
the denasalization of [n] resulting in the voiced plosive [d] at the same place of articulation. They generally occur in isolation as a negative answer to questions.
The negative particle nka is used for general negation of a predicate. It therefore
only occurs before verbs or non-verbal predicates. In example (26) a negated verb
can be compared to the affirmative form:
(26)nken-hi neriki nka rosowe’, tiwe’ enevere rosowe’.
nken=hi
neriki nka ro=sowe’
tiwe’ enevere
ro=sowe’
I.think=QUOT now NEG 3SGm-rain but
tomorrow
3SGm-rain
‘I think today it doesn’t rain, but tomorrow it rains.’
[RP-22/7/04-111]The form of the negative verb nka rosowe’ ‘it doesn’t rain’ (26) only differs from the
affirmative form rosowe’ ‘it rains’ in respect to the preceding negative particle. Negation of intransitive verbs is identical to that of transitive verbs or non-verbal predicates. Examples (27) and (28) illustrate this:
(27)211pikahašer ač nka nohinokopi.
pi=ka-haše=ro
ač
nka no=hinoko=pi
2SG=ATTR-hat=3SGm and NEG 3PL=see=2SG
‘Put the hat on and they don’t see you.’[RP-N4-17]In the present spelling there will only be two different representations: The emphatic noka – [noka],
[doka] or [daka] – and nka [nga].","[351, 352, 353, 354, 355, 356, 357, 358, 359, 360]"

very common, though, that the head noun occurs in a phonetically reduced form. This
is the case with bound and free head nouns. This reduced form may be identical to a
classifier. Examples of compounds with a reduced N2 are in (57) through (59):

šorawok ‘cusi palm’ is composed of two parts, *šor ‘cusi (palm sp.)’ and -wok ‘tree’,
but the first part only exists in compounds. Right-bound nominal stems are generally
only found among adjectives (cf. 4.9.1). The two morphemes are composed with the
help of the linker -a, which I turn back to below. In Table 4.12 I give two paradigms
of plant parts, both based on a right-bound noun stem referring to kinds of palm trees.

linker is unclear to me, especially because it is employed in many other kinds of
morpheme composition. It may be partly related to phonological conditions, but the
multi-functionality of the linking morpheme remains a subject for future research.
Along with some examples in Table 4.12 there are some more examples where the
linker is inserted in the compounds in (63) through (65):
(63)(64)(65)sopirap
sopir-a-po
turtle-LK-bone

CLF:tinyExample (65) is a compound of a noun and a classifier, but also linked by the morpheme -a ‘LK’. It is simply coincidence that the reduced morpheme -po for ‘bone’ in
(63) is homophonous with the classifier. The free noun, however, is nop ‘bone’.
There are a number of left-bound nominal stems that only occur in compounds. It is
sometimes difficult to decide if they should be analyzed as classifiers. I do not consider the reduced form of ‘bone’ -po in (63) a classifier, as it only occurs in compounds. The morpheme -wok, on the other hand, is a left-bound morpheme that is
found in compounds, generally meaning ‘tree’. The same morpheme is used as a
classifier, attached to numerals and adjectives, which refer to trees. In compounds wok has even been semantically more extended. This extension in meaning may be
part of its development into a classifier. In Table 4.13 the different meanings of -wokCHAPTER 4 - THE NOUN AND THE NOUN PHRASE137are described, with the examples divided into the different steps of semantic extensions:

‘ground (poe = down)’
‘place in the sun (ses = sun)’Table 4.13: The semantic extension of N2: -wokTable 4.13 illustrates that the most specific (and probably original) meaning of -wok
is ‘tree’, as in (a). The general lexeme ewokoe’ ‘tree’ has been derived from the
bound root by attaching the unspecified possessor prefix e- and the final emphatic
suffix -i’. The morpheme -wok has been extended to a place where trees or plants are
cultivated: ‘plantation’, as shown in (b). Further the extension leads to the general
meaning ‘place’, as presented in (c).
A great number of classifiers are – apart from being used as classifiers – also part
of a lexeme, where they occur in compounds as N2. An example is the classifier -pi,
which refers to long and thin objects and animals. The most prototypical members of
this class are snakes and worms. In some worm names we do indeed find the classifying morpheme. The word koropi ‘liana’ is also a typical plant including the classifier
-pi. The body part -pih ‘throat, all around neck’ consists of almost only the classifier
morpheme. We can hypothesize that this classifier has also evolved from a full noun
stem meaning ‘worm’ or ‘snake’ or ‘throat’, which was then further extended to
things like kaharopi ‘thread’, yakopi ‘candle’, and virepi ‘horizon’. Payne (1991:383)BAURE: AN ARAWAK LANGUAGE OF BOLIVIA138supports this suggestion by arguing that “sets show cognacy between lexical nouns in
some Maipuran [Arawak, my comment] languages and noun classifying suffixes in
other languages”. He particularly refers to the mentioned classifier for “long, slender,
snake-like” (Payne 1991:383). In his cognate set some Arawak languages use a cognate form of Baure -pi as a lexeme for ‘snake’. He reconstructed the Proto-Arawak
word *aphi (cf. also Aikhenvald 2001:176). This is only one possible way of regarding the evolution of classifiers in general, however. Table 4.14 is a summary of lexemes and compounds supposedly including the classifier -pi ‘CLF:long & thin’ in
Baure.

In Baure noun classification is very important. This phenomenon has been studied in
a number of Arawak (Aikhenvald 1994, 2000; Shephard 1997) and Amazonian languages (Derbyshire & Payne 1990), and many linguists have described the typology
of noun classification in general (Allan 1977; Craig 1986; Dixon 1986; Senft 2000).
The confusion of terminology in this field has been mentioned among others by
Grinevald (2000). Allan’s (1977) overview of noun classification is still referred to as
one of the most useful summaries of noun categorization, particularly concerning
classifiers (e.g. Aikhenvald 2000:6). In his terms Baure has “numeral classifiers”, a
“paradigm type” (Allan 1977:286), classifiers which are “obligatory in many expressions of quantity” (Allan 1977:286). However, the terminology issue is not solved so
easily. Baure classifiers attach to numerals and adjectives; they are part of nouns and
incorporate into verbs. They may also be considered to be “verbal classifiers”, which
do “not classify the verb itself but rather one of the nominal arguments of the verb”
(Grinevald 2000:67). Baure classifiers are attached like agreement markers. Grinevald (2000) argues:
“Classifier systems seem to be secondary grammatical systems [1] which are
derived from existing lexical material [2] and syntactic constructions [3], and
which have long or short histories [4], and varying degrees of dynamism built
into it.” (Grinevald 2000:83)
With reference to this cited text, the main features of Baure classifiers are:CHAPTER 4 - THE NOUN AND THE NOUN PHRASE1391. The classifier system in Baure is a secondary categorization, the primary being
grammatical gender (actually feminine animate versus all others, cf. Figure 4.3) and
number.
2. By their form many classifiers have been derived from or are formally identical to
bound nominal roots, among them many plant parts. However, a subset of classifiers
consists of grammaticalized morphemes, mainly monosyllabic, which cannot be related to any existing lexeme (cf. Figure 4.7).
3. Classification presumably derives from compounding or incorporation (cf. Aikhenvald 1994:421).
4. Some classifiers are phonetically reduced bound nouns, and it seems as if the older
a classifier is, the less recognizable the relation between a classifier and a noun root.
Therefore, the grammaticalized morphemes may have been derived from nouns as
well; the process only leads further back in history.
Examples (66) through (71) illustrate how and where classifiers are attached in
Baure. The classifier in all these examples is -po ‘CLF:tiny’, which refers to insects,
fish, and tiny little things, tiny as powder-like material.

[LO-29/8/03-87]In addition to the examples in (66)–(71), classifiers may be part of a noun compound,
as already shown in Tables 4.13 and 4.14. Many nouns referred to by this classifier
include the form -po themselves. This probably goes back to a compound with the
classifier. Examples are insects like yomoep ‘bee’, seeds like čičorop ‘beans’, powder
like šep ‘chivé’ and yinirep ‘dust’, or other animals of the -po-class, like kočopon
‘caiman’.
The Baure classification system has some features in common with noun class
systems, as shown in Table 4.15. Here Baure is compared with respect to the properties of noun class and classifier systems suggested by Grinevald (2000:62):

–Table 4.15: Distinctions between noun class and classifier systems, with respect to Baure (adapted from
Grinevald 2000:62):Table 4.15 shows that Baure has the following properties of a classifier system: the
classifiers constitute a large number of items and it is a rather open system. The classifying constituent is independent of other grammatical categories, such as number or
gender. In general, the classifier is not attached to the noun classified, but it may be
when the noun has been derived by compounding. There are, on the other hand, also
some properties that are argued to belong to a noun class system: generally all
counted nouns are classified. The numerals are bound forms and have a classifying
element attached. But in addition, there are also classifiers that do not attach to numerals. The way how classifiers attach to elements in a clause resembles agreement
marking, even though it is more frequently anaphoric. Any counted noun is only assigned to one class with no variation. There is also no variation in speech registers.
An important factor is the assignment of every noun to a definite noun class. This
is a property of a noun class system (cf. Table 4.15). In some Baure phrases it mayCHAPTER 4 - THE NOUN AND THE NOUN PHRASE141look as if there are more classifiers referring to the same noun, but in fact this can
easily be explained: In partitive NPs (cf. Table 4.4) the first component may be a
numeral or other modifier with a suffixed classifier. This classifier does not necessarily refer to the noun itself, but possibly only to part of it or to a quantity of it, as illustrated in (72):
(72)apipoe erapoe’/
apičow erapoe’/
apiew erapoe’
api-poe
erapoe’ api-čow
erapoe’ api-ew
erapoe’
two-banana plantain two-CLF:circle plantain two-raceme plantain
‘two plantains, two circles of plantains, two racemes of plantains’The first classifier -poe is the one that actually refers to plantains as a single fruit.
The others are only numerals with a suffixed classifier that refers to a certain number
of plantains. While the first part of (72) is one NP, the other two have to be analyzed
as two connected NPs in a partitive construction (here without determiners).
Classifiers are distinguished for animacy, shape, dimension, texture, function, and
other criteria, but many assignments are not transparent or are only explained by multiple metaphorical transfer. Baure speakers are very sensitive to mistakes in the use of
classifiers. When I count caimans, for example, and I use the classifier applied to
quadruped animals -a ‘CLF:animal’ (73), then my consultants correct me (74). It has
to be referred to by the classifier -po ‘CLF:tiny’. The word šonoki ‘way, path’ is also
assigned to this and no other class (75).

[RP-5/7/04-53]Another example is how fruits are classified. There are two classifiers -i ‘CLF:fruit &
bird’ for sweet fruit (and birds) and -e ‘CLF:unsweet fruit’. The tree calabash rekirok
‘tutuma’ (76) is referred to by a different classifier than mokovore’ ‘papaya’ (78).
The classifier -e cannot be applied to any unsweet fruit, not even if the fruit is not
ripe yet (77). The ‘pumpkin’ mokovis is assigned to the same class as rekirok ‘tutuma’ (76), but, despite its resemblance to a pumpkin, senti ‘watermelon’ is put into
the class of boats and oval containers, cf. (78) and (79). There is a complete list of
which nouns go into which class in Appendix A.2.","[156, 157, 158, 159, 160, 161, 162, 163]"

The indefinite pronoun to ka ‘someone, something’ is used frequently to replace the
head of a RC, but it also functions as a relative pronoun. This type of RC is used
much more frequently than any of the above described by their own. This pronoun
can occur with any kind of subordinate constructions described in 10.2.1 through
10.2.7. There are three examples of the different positions of RC with to ka: anteposed in (84), postponed in (85), and inserted in (86).

[RP-N3-20]The indefinite pronoun to ka can be analyzed as an optional marker when subordination is itself marked on the predicate. But there are, on the other hand, subordinate
clauses that are only marked by to ka, as e.g. in (84) to (86). Only in negative andBAURE: AN ARAWAK LANGUAGE OF BOLIVIA410interrogative clauses the use of to ka seems indispensable for marking all types of
subordination. In (87) and (88) there are two more examples with to ka and a following RC that is marked, in (87) by the action nominalizer -čo ‘NOM2’ and in (88) by
the locative morpheme -yi.

‘You will load wherever you go, you will take your house.’[RP-23/7/04-6]In both examples (87) and (88) to ka is used as an indefinite pronoun, which is
‘something’ in the first and ‘wherever’ in the second, where the locative suffix adds
to the meaning of the pronoun.
The indefinite pronoun to ka in interrogative clauses is found in all constructions
described in 9.4.3. One example is shown in (89):
(89)aiy senior, woyikon-niš to ka nkotorekpa?
aiy senior

[HC-6/7/04-49]An alternative to the form of the question in (89) is woyikon-niš to nkotorekpa, and
there is no obvious meaning difference. It seems that to ka is only used to emphasize
the subordination.
The most common negative construction with the indefinite pronoun is nka to ka,
which literally means ‘nothing, no-one’, but it generally functions as an existential
predicate ‘there is nothing/no-one’. The verbal predicate that follows this predicate is
in fact a RC with participant nominalization -no ‘NOM1’ (10.2.1) or an unmarked RC.
The negative existential construction is demonstrated in example (90):
(90)nka to ka askoni.
nka to
kaasko=ni
help=1SG
‘There is no-one who helps me.’NEGARTIND[LO/GP-15/7/04-156]Further, to ka occurs on various negative complements. Whether to ka itself can be
analyzed as a complementizer, is a matter of analysis, as in the majority of examples
it gets the complementizer apo ‘if, that’ added. All examples in this section can be
thought of with the complementizer in addition (nka) to ka apo, but pronounced
[ngat kap]. In (91) the matrix verb -čo- ‘know’ is followed by a complementCHAPTER 10 - CLAUSE COMBINING AND CLAUSE EMBEDDING411marked by to ka, and in (92) the non-verbal predicate ihirikowon ‘maybe’ functions
as the matrix predicate.

‘Maybe I know (how to do it).’[RP-9/7/04-81]The pronoun to ka seems to function as a general separating element for main clause

principle in Baure.
10.2.9. The apposition (unmarked relative clause)
Very frequently an NP stands in apposition with another specifying NP. The technique of using another phrase of the same type in juxtaposition for specification is
also found in predicate chains or serial verb constructions (cf. 10.3.7). In principle
one NP is more general than the following NP apposition. The NP may be the subject
or object argument in the clause. Examples of such appositions are given in (93)
through (95):

woman
‘The eel, the husband of the woman, was long.’DEM2f[GP-N1/I-10]The apposition in (93) is the NP to neč sopirnev ‘those turtles’, which stands in juxtaposition with the object NP to neč čonomorinev ‘those companions’ and can be
understood as specifying or modifying the main NP.
In (94) and (95) the apposition consists of a complex NP which again includes
another NP in juxtaposition, which is unmarked, but stands in a possessive relation to
the head noun of the apposition. Thus the apposition teč riavinon tič eton is one complex NP, which includes the unmarked possessive NP tič eton ‘of the woman’ (partitive construction, cf. Figure 4.5). The apposition itself, on the other hand, is part of
the head NP of the main clause. Therefore the NPs that occur in juxtaposition are
divided on three different levels.
This section showed how complex subordination can be and was completed with
the juxtaposition of NPs as a basis for comparison to what is described in the following section.
10.3. Multiple predicate constructions, and predicate and clause chains
The most productive way to combine clauses is by chaining predicates or clauses. As
argued in Chapter 9, a clause minimally consists of a predicate, and it is indeed frequently the case that clauses only consist of a predicate. The predicate may be quite
complex, consisting of additional free verbal particles and a number of verbal morphemes directly attached to the verb or non-verbal predicate. Predicate chains are in
principle identical to clause (or predicate phrase) chains. The predicate phrase may
include explicit subject and object arguments in the form of NPs or free pronouns in
addition. This section will show how three types of multiple predicate constructions
can be distinguished: asyndetic coordination of predicates and clauses, verb–
complement constructions, and serial verb constructions. Asyndetic coordination of
predicates involves a series of events that happen one after the other, where the chain
of predicates represents the chronological order of the events. Verb–complement
constructions can again be distinguished in two different types: one type is an unmarked verb complement, in which case the first predicate can sometimes be analyzed as an auxiliary verb; the second type is a complement marked by the action
nominalizer -čo ‘NOM2’. Serial verb constructions are also a kind of chain of predicates. The main distinction between an asyndetic chain of multiple predicates and a
serial construction is that the first one refers to multiple events, while the second one
uses a complex predicate with multiple predicate constituents, but refers to one event
only. Serial verbs are like predicate appositions. In Table 10.2 the main different
types of multiple predicate combinations are summarized and exemplified.","[430, 431, 432, 433, 434]"

‘my shoe’(< Spanish zapato)(21)nikomis

Possessive NPs can be more complex when the possessor is not only cliticized but
also explicitly mentioned in the clause. This is the case in NPs like (22) ‘the lizard’s
house’. Instead of only saying teč rower ‘his house’, the possessor is explicit in the
NP to kotis ‘the lizard’. Example (22) illustrates that complex possessive NPs are
simply the juxtaposition of possessed NP and possessor NP, where the possessor is
already included in the possessed NP by the proclitic ro- ‘3SGm’.

DEM2m

‘the house of the lizard’[RP-N2/I-37]The speakers of the Baure language make extensive use of this kind of possessive
clauses. The same juxtaposition is not always a possessive relation, but may also be a
partitive NP construction112. In partitive NPs the first element in the juxtaposition is
not necessarily a noun, it may also be a numeral, a quantifier, or some other kind of
modifier. The most important fact in the construction seems to be the nominal status
of the second constituent. It functions like the partitive conjunction with of in English. Two examples of partitive NPs are given in (23) and (24):

chiliIn 5.3.1 I demonstrate how the juxtaposition of NPs is also used for equation.","[146, 147]"
"168BAURE: AN ARAWAK LANGUAGE OF BOLIVIAexamples (7) and (16), (17)). Modification within an NP is not very common in
Baure in general. A quantitative text analysis of 22 texts with altogether 9740 words
(cf. Table 4.29) shows this. The texts consisted of narratives, conversation, and artificial stories, four of them from Baptista & Wallin (T-287 through T-289). In all the
texts there were altogether 173 modifiers in NPs, not more than 1,78 % of all words.
In six texts of between 50 and 200 words there is only one modifier or none. The
reason for this is related to the predicative use of modifiers. Predicates are the most
important constituents in every clause in Baure. Among these are not only verbs, but
also a large number of non-verbal predicates. In addition there are strategies like incorporation and compounding. Furthermore adjectives are nominal and can be used
as heads themselves. This all leads to little need for modification within the NP, as
the predicate already contains most of the informational load. This means that the
adjectives introduced in 4.9 are more frequently used as predicates or head nouns
than as modifiers. Consider Table 4.29:

modifiers (2,7 %), 37 are possessive pronouns (1,61 %).
Modifiers can occur in two positions: preceding the head noun and following it.
The majority of modifiers (79,2 %) precede the head. These are possessive pronouns,
numerals, the word ‘other’, and nouns. Adjectives of class I and III generally follow
the head. Adjectives of class II (absolute forms) may precede or follow the head.
These different modifier positions are demonstrated again in Figure 4.9:CHAPTER 4 - THE NOUN AND THE NOUN PHRASE(DET)MOD1MOD2N169MOD3NUMADJ class I‘other’

ADJ class IIFigure 4.9: Position of modifiers in an NPThe figure also shows that the NP is generally introduced by a determiner. Before
numerals there is generally none, but it is possible to add one. Possessive pronouns
are more often preceded by a determiner than not.
Surprisingly, in the text corpus were few adjectives of class I with a suffixed classifier in the text corpus, whereas in elicitation they are numerous. This may again
explain that these forms can be used as head nouns themselves, which they presumably are more frequently. Especially with the “repeater” classifiers it seems redundant
to repeat the noun. This can be observed in (163), where the head noun koyorisoe’
‘totaí fruit’ is only mentioned once, but later in two other sentences the speaker refers
back to it only with adjectives including a classifier: poskiš ‘one (seed)’ and posoki
‘another seed’. The speaker could have added the noun koyoroesoki ‘nut of the totaí
fruit’, but this information is superfluous. In fact the adjectives even only refer to part
of the noun as metonymy.

head directly. This behaviour is comparable to that of modifying adjectives of class
III, which are frequently nominalized forms, marked by -no ‘NOM1’, one of the
nominalizers used in relative clauses (10.2).","[189, 190, 191, 192, 193]"

‘ “There at Mercedes’ place”, she said.’[RP-N4-128]4.8.3. The distributive suffix
The distributive suffix -he can be attached to nouns and verbs (cf. 6.3.6). It is frequently found attached to locative nouns, where it is mutually exclusive with the plural suffix -nev. When -he ‘DISTR’ is attached to a locative noun, it generally means
that there is a number of the item bound together or in a pile or some other kind of
bound plurality. Compare (129) and (130):
(129) yakiso-ye

than one item. Examples of the use of -he in a clause are (131) and (132):

The distributive functions like place noun stems in compounds involving locative

As explained in 3.8.3 Baure adjectives are mainly nominal by their form and morphological behaviour. They can function as modifiers in an NP, as shown here, but they
can also be used as predicate bases (cf. in 5.2). After a morphological description of
adjectives, I will illustrate the nominal (4.9.4) and verbal properties (4.9.5) of adjectives. In 4.10 I refer to modification within NPs.
There are three main morphological types of adjectives, distinguished by their
form. The closed class I of adjectives consists of right-bound roots and includes dimension and age adjectives and a few others. These roots occur as compounds with
classifiers, which agree with the noun they modify. Class II is semi-open, and the
adjectives are used in the absolute form, comparable to absolute nouns. This class
also includes some Spanish loans. The main characteristic of this class is that the
adjectives are unchangeable and do not show any agreement. Class III is open, and
the adjectives are derived forms, generally including the suffix -no ‘NOM1’, which is
also used in relative and interrogative clauses. These nominalized forms may incorporate classifiers and show agreement, but not necessarily.
4.9.1. Class I: Right-bound roots
The small closed class I consists of right-bound roots, which have to be completed
with a classifier or bound noun stem in order to form a word. Also numerals and the
pronoun ‘other’ belong to this class. One semantic group of these bound forms are
the adjectives of dimension in Table 4.20.
There are three distinctions of size: čo- ‘big’, hew- ‘medium size’, and ti- ‘small’.
Length has two degrees: pero- ‘long’ and mohi- ‘short’. The basic morpheme čo‘big’ served as the source of many lexemes that involve size or a big amount, such asCHAPTER 4 - THE NOUN AND THE NOUN PHRASE157čin- ‘old’, čišie’ ‘tall (lit. big vertical size)’, čowon ‘long ago’, čom ‘skin (lit. big
(woven) material)’, the diminutive suffix -či and augmentative -ča, and many others.

are in fact dealing with the morphological process of compounding, with the additional fact that now we also have a bound root on the left. This fact distinguishes
them morphologically from the majority of nouns. Examples are (135) through (137):

[DC-17/4/06-15][JC-13/8/03-81]Adjectives with classifiers can function as modifiers in an NP, as in (135) and (136),
in which case the classifier is an agreement marker that agrees with the modified
head noun. On the other hand, the same forms can also function as nouns themselves,
especially those with “repeater” classifiers, as (137).
The degree of tallness is expressed in a specific way for human beings, i.e. not
with the human classifier attached to the bound roots for size (čo- ‘big’, ti- ‘small’,
and hew- ‘medium size’). The word čon exists and means ‘friend, brother, compan-BAURE: AN ARAWAK LANGUAGE OF BOLIVIA158ion’; it may have been derived from the root čo- ‘big’ and the human classifier -no130.
The two other adjectives ti- ‘small’ and hew- ‘medium size’ have not been found
directly combined with the human classifier. Instead, the adjectival roots get the
bound nominal root -šie’ ‘vertical size’ attached, as illustrated in (138).
(138) čišie’, tišie’, hewošie’
či-šie’,
ti-šie’,
hewo-šie’
big-vert.size small-vert.size medium-vert.size
‘tall, small, medium size (person)’
The adjectives in (138) are restricted to human referents. The bound root -šie’ ‘vertical size’ has caused vowel harmony in the compound čišie’ (not *čošie’). The vowel
o of čo- ‘big’ is a weak vowel and gets generally replaced by the first vowel of the
classifier or a vowel inserted in harmony with the following syllable. Another important semantic group in class I are adjectives of age, represented in Table 4.21:
formmeaningčino-oldmono-youngkoto-newexample
čino-pi
old-CLF:long&thin
‘old (thread)’
ni=mono-pi
1SG=young-QNOM
‘the time of my being young’
koto-pi
new-CLF:long&thin
‘new (thread)’Table 4.21: Adjectives of ageThe adjective čino- ‘old’ can be used with humans and also inanimates, whereas
koto- ‘new’ is not used with humans in the sense of ‘young’. The bound root mono‘young’ is generally not used except for when referring to the childhood days. Age
can also be expressed by specific adjectives that can only be used with animates, or
mainly humans, which are ane’ ‘old (person)’ and monči ‘young, child’. Both are
absolute forms discussed in the next section. The word monči has probably been derived from mono- ‘young’ and the diminutive suffix -či.
Numerals and the root po- ‘other’ are also part of the class I adjectives. There are
only three numerals131, to which the classifier has to be attached. However, the
speakers of Baure have borrowed the numbers above three from Spanish, and they
attach the classifier to the loans as well, as illustrated in (139):

130It may likewise be the nominalizing suffix -no ‘NOM1‘ that derived this lexeme.
“Most [Arawak] languages have just the numbers ‘one’ (proto-Arawak *pa-) and ‘two’ (Proto-Arawak
*(a)pi and *yama: David L. Payne 1991). It is common to use numeral *pa- ‘one’ in the function of an
indefinite pronoun ‘one, someone’, ‘another’” (Aikhenvald 1999:85).

from po- ‘other’. The second part -š may be related to the exclamative enclitic -(n)iš.

roots in this class, as listed in Table 4.23. There may be some more bound roots that
did not occur in my data. The bound root heno- ‘good’ has been included here, as it
can be the base of a non-verbal predicate, like other adjectives. However, the classifiers are not attached to heno- like to other adjectival roots, but the absolute form
henok ‘good’ is preferred in attributive constructions.
Finally, with some variation, there are also two loanwords from Spanish used as
bound roots. These are vero- ‘green’ and asolo- ‘blue’. They are e.g. found in combination with the classifier for clothes and textile -mo, as shown in (140).

4.9.2. Class II: Absolute forms
Another semi-closed class of adjectives are the absolute forms, comparable to (derived) unpossessed nouns:CHAPTER 4 - THE NOUN AND THE NOUN PHRASE161formmeaningcommentsmonik

loan from Spanish pobre ‘poor’
loan from Spanish sonso ‘stupid’
loan from Spanish pícaro ‘rascal’Table 4.24: Absolute adjectivesThe members of this class are semantically diverse. Some forms have been derived
from the class I bound forms, originally possibly all of them. The adjective monik
‘pretty’ has been derived from the bound root of class I, moni- ‘pretty’, by adding the
absolute suffix -ko. The adjective čonok ‘big’ has also been derived from čo- ‘big’.
The suffix -no in čonok ‘big’ may either be the nominalizer -no ‘NOM1’, or it is an
epenthetic syllable. However, it has been lexicalized in this form and is an alternative
to the bound form that is always marked with a classifier. Other absolute forms do
not include the absolute suffix at all. Some are identical to verb stems, such as yak
‘ripe’; others are identical to nouns, such as ane’ ‘old (person)’ which is more often
used as a noun than as a modifier. The major characteristic of this class of adjectives
is the fact that they always remain unchangeable. The adjectives in Table 4.24 can all
stand alone, also in headless clauses or as nominal heads themselves. No classifier or
bound noun root can be incorporated into these forms. These absolute forms are
mainly used as predicates in a clause, as in (141):
(141) monik to pičahahi.

‘Your hair is pretty.’[RP-15/8/03-99]4.9.3. Class III: Derived adjectives
The largest number of adjectives is derived by means of the nominalizer -no ‘NOM1’
and/or with the prefixes ko- ‘ATTR/with’ or mo- ‘PRIV/without’. The open class III
can always get new members simply by deriving them from verbs or other nouns.
The derivational process is in fact a kind of nominalization, but the forms discussed
here are used as attributive and predicative adjectives. Again, the derived forms can
be split into slightly different types.","[176, 177, 178, 179, 180, 181, 182, 183]"

[DC-10/4/06-49]10.1.11 The connector iškon ‘until’
The connective particle iškon ‘until’ is in fact the nominalized form of the verb -iško‘(go, do) until’. It may be surprising that the meaning ‘until’ is generally expressed
by a verb, but this is much more common in Baure than the form iškon as a connector. However, it seems to be a perfect direct translation of Spanish hasta ‘until’ and is
found more and more in the most recent data. Maybe I have also encouraged that by
priming speakers using it myself as a more familiar construction. Older speakers favour the use of the verbal construction, as shown in (45):

[GP-N1/II-17]
Sometimes the connector is combined with the complementizer as iškon apo ‘until
that’, which is the method how an adverb takes a complement. The description of
iškon ‘until’ can be taken as a representation of the way adverbs are used in clause
combining. On the scale of the continuum between grammatical connector of clauses
and adverbs, iškon shall rather be settled closer towards the lexical category. I suggest a scale of the mentioned elements of this section as shown in Figure 10.2:

separateness of two clauses. By marking a predicate, which is preceded by a predicate, with ver ‘PERF/already’ separates this predicate from the other one, because in a
chain of multiple predicates ver as a preverbal particle would occur only once at the
beginning of the predicate chain. Sometimes ver replaces the complementizer apo ‘if,

[HC-8/3/06-69]10.2. Relative clauses and other subordinate clauses
In this section subordination strategies in Baure are described, which include what is
generally referred to as relative clauses. The predicate in the subordinate clause is
transformed into a nominal by different processes. The types of nominalization men-BAURE: AN ARAWAK LANGUAGE OF BOLIVIA398tioned in this section have been discussed in 5.2.4. There are participant, action, and
product nominalizations, by which a nominal is derived from a verb. Further there is
quality nominalization, which derives an abstract noun from attributive modifier
nouns (adjectives, cf. 4.9.5). In addition there are two more specific forms of subordinate marking: locative and temporal marking. Each type of derivation forms a different kind of relative or subordinate clause. Structurally all these subordinate clauses
are almost identical.
Turning now to other related constructions, the cleft construction with tiow ‘this
is’ is a specific type of construction for turning the focus on an element in the clause.
The cleft particle tiow is always followed by a relative clause, in which the predicate
occurs in a subordinate position. Nearly all of the major interrogative constructions
consist of a specific kind of relative clause. Relative clauses are finally compared to a
simple juxtaposition of noun phrases as apposition, which is an unmarked alternative
to modifying relative clauses.
The major type of relative clause (RC) is headless. A headless RC functions as a
head itself, it may represent the subject or object argument in the main clause, or an
oblique object. Payne (1997:328) states that generally, “languages in which nominal
modifiers are themselves nouns are more likely to employ headless relative clauses as
a major RC strategy”. This holds for Baure as well, which is a language with nominal
modifiers (cf. 4.9). They are in the same position as nominal modifiers, but see below. Generally there is no relativizing element, except for the nominalized status of
the subordinate clause, but the majority of RCs are introduced by an article or pronoun (demonstrative, personal or indefinite). How a headless RC functions as an argument in the clause is best understood when compared to predication without subordination. In (48) a simple example of a headless relative clause (subject) is shown
with a non-verbal predicate, which can be directly compared to a clause with the
same predicate and a simple subject NP in (49):

"BAURE: AN ARAWAK LANGUAGE OF BOLIVIA3108.2. Articles and demonstrative pronouns or determiners
What is summed up under the term “determiners” in this grammar includes one article, and three different kinds of demonstratives. Not included are other words like
quantifiers or numerals. In general all four determiners in Baure share many characteristics, and their individual properties are difficult to determine. Therefore I will
first refer to their common characteristics before the specific character of each one is
described.
The position of a determiner is always NP initial. This may be directly before the
noun or before one or two modifiers (of the type MOD1, cf. 4.10), as in (15):
(15)tečpon
other
‘that other person’DEM2mčinti
person
[JC-13/7/04-59]A determiner can also serve to trigger nominalization. This means that a modifier can
function as an NP with a determiner, and some predicates are simply marked for their
nominal character by a determiner (cf. nominalized predicates in relative clauses in
10.2). Determiners are noun class insensitive, i.e. they do not change their forms like
some modifiers do, but demonstratives are distinguished for gender and number (cf.
Table 8.8).
All determiners can also mark an element as referential, to a certain degree202.
When an NP is used referentially, a determiner is generally obligatory. Only a few
modifiers, such as pon ‘other’ or the possessive pronouns, can sometimes mark an
NP without a preceding determiner. A determiner has the effect of individuation of
the referent. This means that certain mass nouns may occur without a determiner
when referred to generically, but they are preceded by a determiner when the referent
is individualized. However, the number of non-individuated NPs in the Baure language is relatively small. The individualization effect is demonstrated in (17), contrasted with (16).

‘the next day’ in contrast with more general enevere ‘tomorrow’ (cf. 8.2.2).
Determiners are used in complex possessive (18) or partitive NPs (19). These consist
of a sequence of, generally, two NPs, of which at least the second one is marked by a
determiner (cf. 4.3.3), as demonstrated in (18) and (19):

privative prefix – ko- or mo- respectively – followed by the noun stem. An absolute
or possessive suffix may be attached to the noun stem – -ko ‘ABS’ or -no ‘POSS’ respectively. Finally certain lexemes are followed by the nominalizer -no ‘NOM1’, most
of all, nominalized verbs, but also a subgroup of adjectives (cf. 4.9.3). This whole
noun base is the unit to which the possessor proclitic is attached and to which diminutive, augmentative, plural, distributive, and locative suffixes are attached. There
may also be clausal enclitics added at the very end of the word, which are not word
class specific. There are some restrictions concerning the combinability of the morphemes. Nouns marked by the privative prefix cannot be possessed, but they are
mainly used as predicates (cf. 5.2.3). While the absolute suffix is attached to derived
unpossessed nouns, the possessive suffix is only attached to derived possessed nouns
(cf. 4.3). Therefore absolute and possessive are mutually exclusive.
Furthermore, diminutive and augmentative marking is mutually exclusive. The
marking for plural and the distributive marking seem to be mutually exclusive as
well. Example (2) illustrates the difference between noun stem and base:

base4.2. Gender
Gender is an inherent category in Baure, and it is mainly biological, not grammatical.
Only feminine animates are considered as grammatically feminine, and all other
nouns are masculine. The gender becomes apparent by agreement in crossreferencing clitics, and personal and possessive and demonstrative pronouns (cf. 8.2–
8.3). In these pronouns and clitics gender is only distinguished in the 3SG. The gender
distinction is demonstrated in Figure 4.3:CHAPTER 4 - THE NOUN AND THE NOUN PHRASE117NOUNSfeminine:
animate (mainly human)masculine:

generalFigure 4.3: Gender distinction in Baure nounsInanimates are always referred to by unmarked masculine, while animates can also be
unmarked for gender, as generally all animals. Only for human beings and a few pets,
domesticated animals or animals in a narrative the gender distinction is made. The
gender is not formally apparent in the noun, but there are suppletive forms for female
and male humans and kinship terms and a few animals. Some of these nouns have a
general form that refers generically to both genders, and there are gender specific
nouns in addition. There is e.g. a general noun -iron ‘parent’ and the specific
nouns -en ‘mother’ and -ia’ ‘father’. These general nouns are also of unmarked masculine gender, but then generally interpreted as masculine, while the feminine form
has to be marked by a feminine determiner (at least the feminine demonstrative108 ti
‘DEM1f’). Compare the interpretation of the general form as masculine and feminine
in comparison to the specific forms in examples (3) and (4):

feminine form for grandparents, but only two forms are present today. The
form -ašok is generally used for ‘grandfather’ and -os for ‘grandmother’,
while -aškanev means ‘grandparents’ and usually refers to the married couple of
grandfather and grandmother. This seems to be parallel to the Spanish system, where
the masculine form is pluralized and refers to both genders. However, it does not
necessarily have to be the original Baure system of subdivision, as we find different
traits elsewhere. Siblings (cf. (5) and (6)) are divided according to the point of reference, i.e. in reference to a man the noun -piri ‘sibling (of the same sex)’ means
‘brother’, whereas in reference to a woman the same lexeme means ‘sister’. This relative noun co-exists with the gender specific forms for the opposite cases: the

This has to do with the use of this demonstrative as a feminine article, opposed to the general article to,
which is interpreted as masculine (cf. 8.2).","[137, 138, 139]"
"CHAPTER 8 - CLOSED WORD CLASSES325A form similar to hesitative –ha– is used for a very distinct purpose in discourse. It is
generally nasalized as hã ‘what about?’, introducing questions or as a marker for elliptic questions. Nasalization is not phonemic in Baure, which may be one reason
why this interjection sometimes lacks the nasal quality of the vowel. It can also introduce a suggestion (60). Furthermore, this interjection is used to show agreement ‘yes’
or to demonstrate that the hearer is listening to what the speaker says (61). Examples
are found in (59) through (61):

‘Carajo, I eat you!’[RP-N3-49]In this section I also want to point at a phenomenon exclusively found in songs (cf.
Appendix B.2). In almost all songs a vowel -a- is either added word finally or replaces the final vowel -o. Sometimes it is even the syllable -ya, added after the final
vowel -i. It seems to be important for the musical binding of words, for the keeping
up the rhythm and so on. The following example is taken from an old recording of a
speaker who had already died in 1992. She spoke nearly exclusively Baure and is the
mother of three of my main informants.

[MP-S3-1]However, the younger speakers insert the rhythmic syllable as well. The sound made

8.4.2. Discourse particles
There are also a number of other particles in Baure used in discourse. Some of these
discourse particles are analyzable, but semantically not transparent, conventionalized
expressions. Discourse particles can be used for greetings, such as nte’ ‘hello’ or
hare’ ‘good day’. The word hare’ also means ‘clear, light’ with reference to the
weather. The already mentioned particle hãti’ ‘what about you?’ can be analyzed as a
blend of an interjection and a reduced pronoun. The word for ‘thank you’, asoropaiy,CHAPTER 8 - CLOSED WORD CLASSES327is the well-known Spanish loan Diós se lo pague ‘God will pay you for it’209. Table

-IRRTable 8.14: Discourse particles8.4.3. Onomatopoeic words
There are quite a number of onomatopoeic words or roots, most of which refer to
animal names and animal noises. The majority are nouns. In addition there are some
verb roots. In other word classes we do not come across onomatopoeia.
Among the animal names, there are mainly bird names that consist of syllables
that might resemble the sounds these birds make, generally reduplicated, such as
sirisiri ‘falcon’, sorisori ‘owl’, poepoe’ ‘trogón (bird sp.)’, tatasoe’ ‘woodpecker’,
and tarar ‘raven’. In some words sounds occur that do not fit within the Baure phonological system. On the one hand, some words may have been borrowed from another indigenous language, such as mehelele ‘cuyabo (nightjar, bird sp.)’, but in other
cases these sounds are simply unique to animal names. The most striking phonologi209This phrase has been widely borrowed into indigenous languages all over Latin America, as e.g. in
other languages of Bolivian Amazonia: Itonama (solopay, Crevels, p.c.), and Cavineña (yusurupai,
Guillaume 2004:88), or other languages, such as Ecuadorian Imbabura Quichua (diusulupagui, Rendón,
p.c.).","[346, 347, 348, 349]"
"233CHAPTER 10 - CLAUSE COMBINING AND CLAUSE EMBEDDING383koeč ‘because’. The semantically dependent clause introduced by the connector is
grammatically not marked for its dependency, but resembles the coordinate constructions with a connector. Therefore the term dependent clause will not be used in this
grammar.
In Payne (1997:319–320) conditional clauses and other (so-called “absolute”)
clauses are subsumed under adverbial clauses. In this grammar conditional clauses
are described in section 10.3, as the majority of them are simply juxtaposed clauses,
in which the verbal morphemes on the predicates show the irrelation. The complementizer apo ‘if, that’ only plays a minor role as an alternative in open conditional
clauses. Also other types of juxtaposition with specific “adverbial” interpretations
exist: locative, temporal and final.
10.1. Clause combining with a connector
Clauses may be combined by means of a connective element, a particle that links
these clauses and defines the relation between them, called connector in this grammar
(cf. Chapter 3.8.6). But even though these connectors parallel English clause linkage
with a conjunction, it has to be pointed out that most clause combinations use clause
juxtaposition or predicate chaining and complementation. When looking through a
Baure narrative not many connectors can be found, the ones present are divided by
fine-grained distinctions. There is probably a lot of speaker variation, and it may be
related to style and knowledge of the language how many connectors are used in a
narrative. I compared the narratives I collected with similar ones collected in the
1960s by Baptista & Wallin (unpublished), and I noticed very few connectors, though
more of them in the more recent data. Some of the connectors that the speakers use
today, have evolved from verbs and might even be relatively new in development.
Some others are used in different ways in the older data, and there are additional constructions that the speakers do not use any more today (this is e.g. the case with tiwe’
‘but’).
The connectors are distinguished into coordinating and subordinating and these
categories are distinguished further (as summed up in Table 10.1). As mentioned
above, there are no other signs of how the subordinate clause is dependent on the
main clause than the meaning of the events (cf. Givón 1990:826). The major constituent order can be symbolized as [C1] [co C2]234, where “co” stands for connector,
C1 for main clause and C2 for linked clause; and it is shown in a representative example in (1):
(1)C1
[connector C2]

a connector. The connector is indeed always clause initial. With subordinating con234In reference to Haspelmath (2004:6) [A] [co B], where “co” stands for coordinator.","[404, 405]"
"CHAPTER 3 - MORPHOLOGICAL PROCESSES AND WORD CLASSES873.3. Affixation
There are many processes of affixation which cannot definitively be categorized as
either inflectional or derivational.
Nouns are distinguished into possessed and unpossessed, where possessed forms
may be derived from the free unpossessed forms or vice versa. This may be considered an inflectional process, as e.g. in (9):
(9)unpossessed
yaki
→
yaki
fire
‘fire’possessed
niyakin
ni=yaki-no
1SG=fire-POSS
‘my fire’In (9) the possessive suffix -no creates the noun -yakin ‘fire’, which carries the same
meaning as yaki ‘fire’. The difference is the possessability. The new form is likewise
a noun, which is mainly used when the possessor is in focus. Thus the form -yakin
could be considered an inflectional form of yaki. In other possessive derivations the
new form differs in meaning from the source, as in (10):
(10)possessed
rowaki
→
ro=waki
3SGm=hand.palm
‘his palm of the hand’unpossessed
ewaki
e-waki
UNSP-crotch
‘a crotch of branches’The unspecified possessor marker e- in (10) derives the new lexical base ewaki
‘crotch of branches’ from the possessed noun -waki ‘palm of hand’. How closely
related derivation and inflection are, is shown by the fact that a second interpretation
of rowaki is the translation ‘its crotch of branches’, where ro- ‘3SGm’ refers to a tree
as the possessor. Therefore the meaning predominantly assigned to ewaki is already
present in rowaki ‘his palm of hand/crotch of branches’.
Another problem is the interpretation of classifier suffixes on various word categories. When a classifier referring to a noun in the immediate context is attached to a
right-bound adjective, this could be analyzed as agreement, and is thus inflectional
rather than derivational, as in (11):
(11)to pari činompe
to
pari čino-mpe
ART
house old-CLF:flat
‘an/the old house’[RP-15/8/03-72]The classifier -mpe- ‘CLF:flat’ refers to flat objects and houses. In the NP in (11) the
adjective činompe ‘old (house)’ modifies the head noun pari ‘house’ and is marked
by the classifier as a kind of agreement. However, this would presuppose agreement
is generally associated with noun class systems. In 4.7 it is argued that Baure seems
to be on the margin between a classifier and a noun class system. In fact classifiers
are also frequently used for the derivation of new lexemes, as in (12):BAURE: AN ARAWAK LANGUAGE OF BOLIVIA88(12)kahar
kahar
cotton
‘cotton’→kaharopi
kaharo-pi
cotton-CLF:long&thin
‘cotton thread’An even more complicated case is the conversion of verbs into nouns in subordinate
constructions, such as relative and interrogative clauses97 with the nominalizer -no
‘NOM1’. On the one hand this suffix derives nouns from verbs lexically, as in (13):
(13)nti’ imir nikon.
nti’ imir niko-no
1SG very eat-NOM1
‘I am a big eater.’[RP-4/8/03-78]The same derivational morpheme -no ‘NOM1’ marks the main verb of a relative
clause, as in (14):
(14)head
relative clause
kwe’ tin marip
nikon čintinev.
kwe’ tin
marip
niko-no činti-nev
exist DEM3f witch
eat-NOM1 person-PL
‘There is that witch that eats people.’[GP-N7-39]As is obvious from (13) and (14) this nominalization process leads to the same form
nikon ‘eater’, and in both cases the verb is changed into a noun that can be the argument in a clause. The category-changing effect in the interrogative clause in (15) appears much more to be an inflectional process, however:
(15)amo yinikon?
amo
yi=niko-no
why.not 2PL=eat-NOM1
‘Why don’t you (PL) eat?’amo yinikieron?
amo
yi=nik=ro-no
why.not 2PL=eat=3SGm-NOM1
‘Why don’t you eat it?’[RP-Q-34]The verbs in (15) carry the subject proclitic yi- ‘2PL’ and also function as the main
verbs in the interrogative clauses (also cf. (1)). The nominalizer is simply attached to
mark the different clause type. It is also striking that this affix is attached after a personal enclitic -ro ‘3SGm’ (second question), but in general affixation is internal to
cliticization. Another example of an interrogative clause with this suffix was given in
(1). Haspelmath (1996) argues that the traditional view of derivation referring to the
lexicon and inflection as word-class internal is simplistic, showing that inflectional
affixes may also change the word-class (Haspelmath 1996:43). Therefore it may be
argued that these nominalizing suffixes in Baure are indeed inflectional in some environments, but change the word-class as well.
In this grammar the distinction between inflectional and derivational morphemes
will not be made. The majority of processes can be regarded as derivational in traditional terms.","[108, 109, 110]"

5.2. Non-verbal predicates
Any other word class apart from verbs can be used as a non-verbal predicate. The
functions of these predicates are various. There are existential, possessive, attributive,
equative, and locative constructions, as described in 5.3. Some non-verbal predicates
may also be translated as English verbs, for example many predicates based on time
adverbs, as in (21):

PERF finish-COP=2SG ART
2SG=cook-NOM2-COP
‘Have you already finished cooking?’[JC-29/7/04-28]In (21) the meaning ‘go’ is included in both, the first and the second predicate in different ways. The imperative predicate kew is generally interpreted as motion away
from the speaker (cf. 9.3.4). The suffix -pa ‘GO’ adds the meaning of motion away
from the speaker to the second predicate. The form eto- in (22) is also glossed ‘finish’, but it should not be analyzed as a verb (cf. 5.2.2).
Most non-verbal predicates are based on adjectives and nouns, and are attributive
or equative. They are juxtaposed to the subject. Only in negative clauses and in the
case of pronominalization the subject is marked on the predicate by a personal enclitic, as in (23) and (24):CHAPTER 5 - PREDICATE TYPES AND SPECIFIC PREDICATE CONSTRUCTIONS179(23)a te erawok – napiri’ ver monikowaper.

1SG=son PERF man-COS=3SGm
‘My son is already a man.’[JI-22/8/03-32]As (23) and (24) show, the subjects are marked by -ro ‘3SGm’. Recall that objects on
verbs are marked by pronominal enclitics. They will be shown to be similar to those
on non-verbal predicates (cf. 5.2.1). In other Arawak languages there is also a subgroup of intransitive verbs that show this kind of argument marking: In a subgroup of
intransitive verbs the subject is marked by a suffix, whereas on transitive verbs this
suffix refers to the object. The phenomenon has been described as a Split-S system
(cf. Aikhenvald 1999:86; Facundes 2000a:278). The verbs with this kind of argument
marking (frequently referred to as objective marking, cf. Facundes 2000a) are referred to as stative verbs (Aikhenvald 1999), descriptive verbs (Facundes 2000a:274)
or absolute verbs (Wise 1986:571). Since Baure seems to deviate from other Arawak
languages, a different approach is taken in this grammar. In Baure there are no verbs
taking a suffix enclitic, but all predicates with this kind of subject marking are analyzed as non-verbal. All non-verbal predicates parallel nominal predicates and their
way of marking a subject. Stative verbs in Baure constitute a subgroup of intransitive
verbs, but they show exactly the same kind of argument marking as other intransitive
verbs, cf. (25):

1SG.eat because sick-COS=1SG
‘I cannot eat well any more, because I am very sick.’[JC-14/3/06-38]The major difference between the two predicates -kotive- ‘be sick’ and mavi ‘sick’ is
the way the subject arguments are cross-referenced: by a proclitic in (25) and an enclitic in (26). Further -kotive- is a bound form, whereas mavi is a free form. Even
though both words have been translated by ‘sick’ in the examples, they have a
slightly different connotation: -kotive- means that someone is sick and may recover,
while mavi is used for old people when they get sick before they die. The non-verbal
predicate based on the adjective mavi is thus interpreted as a rather permanent state,
and the verb -kotive- as temporary. The same effect can also be observed with nominalized verbs used as non-verbal predicates instead of the verbs they are derivedBAURE: AN ARAWAK LANGUAGE OF BOLIVIA180from. The stative verb -tiri- ‘know’ is frequently used in the nominalized form tirin
‘knowing’, which may be considered a derived adjective139. The nominalized form
expresses a permanent state, and the verb rather a temporary state or the process of
gaining knowledge, as in (27) and (28):

[JC-27/8/03-52][GP-4/7/04-53]Both predicates can take a complement, but the complement of the non-verbal predicate is marked for subordination by -čo ‘NOM2’ (cf. 10.3.6), and the verb -tiri- takes
an unmarked complement (cf. 10.3.5).
Stative verbs have much in common with non-verbal predicates, which are generally all stative as well. Stative predicates (verbs and non-verbal) can be distinguished
from non-stative verbs in Baure in relation to how certain base suffixes are attached.
The base suffixes described in more detail in 6.5 can be subdivided into stative and
non-stative suffixes. Stative suffixes can be attached to active and stative predicates.
Non-stative suffixes are generally only attached to non-stative verbs. When they are
attached to a stative predicate, the linking morpheme -a has to be inserted before
them (cf. 3.3.2). Table 5.3 shows all stative suffixes:

"BAURE: AN ARAWAK LANGUAGE OF BOLIVIA60In Baptista & Wallin’s version for the speakers (1960–1970) and Valenzuela’s version (1996) the voiceless and voiced allophones of one phoneme (see 2.1.3 and 2.5.1)
get two different spellings, i.e. p and b for /p/, t and d for /t/, k and g for /k/, and ch
and z for /t/. In their linguistic notes Baptista & Wallin already assigned both
sounds to a single phoneme, which is necessary, because the voicing effect can vary
and is not always obligatory. Even more problematic is that the spelling of the voiced
allophone of /p/ as b is not distinguishable from the phoneme /v/, which is spelt b in
all other suggestions. I will use v in order to keep these separate phonemes apart
more transparently.
In the suggestion of Valenzuela (1996) labialized consonants before the diphthong /oe/ are spelt as a sequence of the consonant and the vowel u, e.g. pu in /poe/
for [pw] or [po] or [pu], which is confusing and illogical, because this vowel /u/ does
not exist in the language otherwise. It is true that [u] is a frequent allophone of /o/
that is realized when consonants are followed by the diphthong /oe/ or the semivowel
/w/ (cf. 2.1.1 and 2.1.3). I see no reason for introducing another vowel beside the four
vowel phonemes of the language, especially not because the degree of labialization
can vary a lot (especially after delabialization of the diphthong, cf. 2.2.3).
The spelling of the glottal fricative [h] like the Spanish j [x] is misleading for
Spanish speakers concerning the place of articulation (velar instead of glottal fricative). The glottal stop, even though not phonemic in most cases (cf. 2.1.3), will be
spelt with the apostrophe ’, so that diphthongs can be distinguished from sequences
of two vowels (where it is on the edge of being phonemic) and so that strong and
stressed vowels can be distinguished. Here are examples:
(111) [nia]
[nia]/nia/
/nia/→ nia’
→ ni’a’‘rainbow’
‘my body’(112) [ij]
[ras]
[jti]/ije/
/rasoe/
/jiti/→ šiye’
→ rasoe’
→ yiti’‘fox’
‘orange’
‘2PL’Furthermore, I prefer one letter for one phoneme. Therefore I will spell [] and [t] š
and č respectively, instead of the diagraphs sh and ch. This is more economical and
gives a better overview of the polysynthetic and sometimes very long words. Stress
will not be marked, as it is not contrastive in general (cf. 2.4.3).
The language is only spoken by a few people above 60 nowadays, among which
six people can read and write. The language needs to be documented now, at the edge
of its death, as precisely as possible. The speakers prefer this alphabet, which was
presented, explained and contrasted with the one used in the latest publication (Olivio
2003) in the meetings of the indigenous organisation (Subcentral Indígena Baure).
The speakers decided upon the spelling that I use here, because it is more different
from the Spanish one and shows the distinct status of Baure as a real language and
not only a dialecto and subordinate to Spanish. In spite of all that I am aware of the
fact that it is more difficult to write the letters š and č on the computer (keyboard settings have to be changed and adjusted), and especially in comparison to other Bolivian Lowland languages the alphabet might have to be changed in favour of simplic-CHAPTER 2 - PHONOLOGY61ity. The only changes that would then be needed concern the three letters: š → sh, č
→ch, h → j.
2.4. Phonotactics
In this section the phonotactics and segmental phonology are described. In 2.4.1 the
syllable structure is shown, in 2.4.2 the phonological word is defined, and in 2.4.3
word stress is described.
2.4.1. Syllable structure
When analyzing the syllable structure in this language, it is important to distinguish
two different levels: the phonological level with all the underlying phonemes, and the
phonetic level with the actual pronunciation of the phonemes in combination and the
proceeded processes of vowel elision and palatalization (cf. 2.2.1 and 2.2.2)). It also
seems to be the case that the underlying level is the more characteristic of the language, and it is this level where stress rules are applied. That means that e.g. closed
syllables are only a result of phonological processes and exist on the phonetic level.
Therefore I will concentrate on the underlying level when referring to syllable structure in this chapter. There will be reference to the phonetic level as well. The basic
underlying syllable structure in Baure is:
(C) V or C V1V2 (V3)
Only the vowel (V), the nucleus of the syllable, is obligatory in Baure. This syllable
type is found less frequent than the most common CV syllable with a consonant in
the onset. The syllable type V is restricted to the vowels /a/, /e/ and /i/ word initially.
There are only two examples of the vowel /o/ in the onset and word initially: oš
‘capivara’ and okorem ‘singing bird sp.’. There can also be a complex vowel in the
syllable (V1V2(V3)), a diphthong or triphthong or vowel sequence of the types described in 2.1.2, but only with a consonant in the onset (C V1V2(V3)). In the underlying structure no consonant clusters occur within a syllable, except for Spanish loanwords. The possible syllable structures are exemplified in Table 2.8:

more than in the example presented here. The syllable structures in Table 2.8 refer to
the underlying structures, but in the actual phonetic realizations there are also many
more possible syllables. Because of regular vowel elision syllable finally, closed syllables are frequent (cf. Baptista & Wallin 1968:6). Then there are the following types
of closed syllables as a consequence:BAURE: AN ARAWAK LANGUAGE OF BOLIVIA62underlying sylla-phonetic rep-blesresentationntorini-tori[n-trj]my friendV + CVini-no[in]waterCV + CVpinpi-no[pin]twinnipoiyni-po-yi[ni-poiy]my foot

pineappleTable 2.9: Phonetic syllable structuresThe syllable consisting of one consonant can only be a nasal (N). This is very frequently the reduced 1SG person clitic for possessor or subject cross-reference ni-. The
underlying syllables are represented with a capital O referring to the elided vowel.
Generally I imply that it was the vowel /o/, because it is that vowel which occurs
when a morpheme is added. But there is historical and cross-linguistic85 evidence that
also the vowel /a/ can be elided. In addition, there can be observed a certain flexibility and vowel harmony of the vowel /o/. It is therefore not as stable in its phonetic
form as the other three vowels. Also the final vowel /i/, which generally palatalizes
the preceding consonant, may frequently be lost and therefore create phonologically
closed syllables. In the orthographic representation of words with deleted vowels, I
will write the most common isolated form (phonetic representation) and not a possible underlying phonological form. As long as the vowels do not have to be reconstructed historically, but can be found synchronically, they will be written when pronounced. This creates some variation in the data, but it may also show which words
are on the way of lexicalizing a reduced form, such as ntori ‘my friend’ in Table 2.9.
This word used to be *ni-tori (1SG-friend), but this underlying form is never pronounced as such or even judged to be wrong, so that the reduced form ntori can be
considered as the basic lexicalized form.
The final syllable of a word contains more often one of the weak vowels /i/ or /o/,
which cause the elision or palatalization process. Some syllables or specific combinations cannot be encountered at all in the data, summed up in Table 2.10:

86
The specific restrictions of the phonemes /v/ and /w/ have been summed up in Table 2.3.
84CHAPTER 2 - PHONOLOGY63Even though there are many closed syllables, consonant clusters are not allowed if
belonging to one syllable, with a few exceptions. First of all there are no underlying
consonant clusters in Baure, if the word is not a Spanish loan (cf. Table 2.4). Then
the type of consonant cluster that may occur phonetically is restricted to a nasal and a
following voiced plosive or affricate (cf. 2.5.1), as e.g. in mpon ‘three (people)’, but
generally the nasal is syllabic and can therefore not be considered to be part of the
syllable. This cluster of a nasal and a plosive or affricate is never found word finally.
2.4.2. The phonological word
There are certain restriction and minimal requirements for a phonological word.
These requirements are partly dependent on the word class. The main claims here are
made for nouns, while verbs are mentioned oly briefly. More information will be
prevailed in the specific chapters on the word classes.
Nouns are in general trisyllabic or disyllabic underlyingly. The phonetic form
may, however, be monosyllabic very frequently as well, when the final vowel is
elided e.g. The very few underlyingly monosyllabic nouns have to consist of a heavy
syllable, i.e. either include a heavy stressed vowel (cf. 2.4.3) or a diphthong. The
monosyllabic nouns that can be found in Baure are shown in Table 2.11:
free rootstranslationbound rootstranslationna’
ni’
nia’
poe’egg
mosquito
rainbow
axe-’a’
-hi’
-šabody
horn
furTable 2.11: Monosyllabic noun rootsBound noun roots are the nouns which are obligatorily possessed, i.e. they are always
preceded by a person proclitic. That produces actually disyllabic words phonetically,
and the person proclitics are not extrametrical (cf. 2.4.3). The vowel /o/ never occurs
in a monosyllabic noun, neither free nor bound root.
In the minor word classes there are a number of monosyllabic words, but the majority of particles, determiners, adverbs, conjunctions, are disyllabic underlyingly.
Grammatical morphemes are nearly always monosyllabic, so are classifiers and clitics, but these never form an independent word. Phonologically monosyllabic words
generally attach to the following lexeme87, as demonstrated in the following examples:

"CHAPTER 8 - CLOSED WORD CLASSES315As mentioned above, time adverbs are frequently used with determiners, but most of
the time with teč. This kind of marking is further found with verbs, where they turn a
clause into a temporal subordinate clause, as in (30) and (31):

The demonstratives ten/tin/to nen have been subsumed under the term distal, not necessarily interpreted in local terms. It can also mean disapproval and absence. When
the distal demonstrative is used with an NP, it generally moves the argument further
away from the speaker and hearer, as in (32):

to get eaten.

The descriptions of the demonstrative pronouns need more investigation, and especially a comparison with the place adverbs (Table 8.1) would be one promising aspect of future research.
DEM3f8.3. Pronouns and pronominal clitics
In this section the Baure personal and possessive pronouns are described. Both are
derived from the basic personal cross-referencing markers, used as pro- and encliticsCHAPTER 8 - CLOSED WORD CLASSES317for argument marking on verbal and non-verbal predicates (cf. Chapter 5) and for
possessor marking on nouns (cf. Chapter 4). I will also briefly refer to the unspecified
proclitic e- (8.3.2) and the indefinite pronoun to ka (8.3.6).
8.3.1. Personal clitics
I will start with the basic, but dependent forms: the personal clitics, from which the
free pronominal forms have been derived204. The underlying forms of pro- and enclitics are identical, but the actual form of some of the enclitics is rather different from
the basic form due to phonological rules (cf. 2.5.5). The basic forms of the person
marking clitics are represented in Table 8.9:
PERSONNUMBER
SINGULAR1
2
3 feminine
3 masculinenipiriro-PLURAL
viyino-Table 8.9: The personal proclitics205As Table 8.9 shows, the personal clitics are all monosyllabic. The form for 1SG is
frequently reduced to bare nasal n-, and this causes the subsequent voicing of the
following plosive or affricate, when it is the initial sound of the base that it is attached to (cf. 2.5.1). The plural forms have not been derived from the singular forms.
There is only a gender distinction in 3SG. It is striking that the Baure 3SG feminine
form (ri-) has developed from what is referred to as masculine or non-feminine in all
other Arawak languages. Almost all other languages of the family have a personal
form with a high front vowel that refers to non-feminine gender, and usually a (middle) back vowel which refers to feminine gender (cf. Aikhenvald 1999:88). In Baure,
however, the high front vowel is used for the feminine – ri- (3SGf) – and the middle
back vowel for masculine – ro- (3SGm). Matteson (1972:161) already remarked in
her reconstruction of Proto-Arawakan that “Baure reverses the gender markers”. The
predominance of the high front vowel also in other feminine forms is significant, as
in the demonstratives ti ‘DEM1f’, tič ‘DEM2f’, and tin ‘DEM3f’.
The personal proclitics are used for possessor marking on nouns and for subject
marking on verbs. The enclitic forms are generally used for object cross-reference.
There can also be two of them attached to one another, referring to two objects (cf.
5.1.3). Furthermore, the subject of non-verbal predicates is encliticized as well. The
proclitics are generally obligatory, whereas the enclitics are optional with an explicit
referent, and are otherwise pronominal in nature. Personal clitics can also be attached
to the interrogative particle ko ‘why?’ (cf. 9.4.1). Finally, the 3SGm personal enclitic204It is theoretically also possible that the clitics have been derived from the free pronouns.
The personal cross-referencing forms are very similar in almost all Arawak languages and generally
taken as one of the main factors to determine membership of the language family (cf. 1.4).
205BAURE: AN ARAWAK LANGUAGE OF BOLIVIA318can be found as a frozen morpheme in nouns, where it seems to have served for
nominal derivations. One example is given in Figure 8.3:
toerok
toero-ko
field-ABS
‘field’>toerkier
toero-ko=ro
field-ABS=3SGm
‘field worker’Figure 8.2: Nominal derivation with a personal clitic8.3.2. Unspecified eThe prefix e- ‘UNSP’ is only attached to nouns in my data, with the exception of two
examples where it is attached to verbs in the subject slot. The morpheme e- seems to
be more like a prefix, and its application is much more reduced than that of the personal clitics. There is no derived independent form like *eti’ ‘it’206 (compare 8.3.3). It
is mainly attached to nouns referring to body parts, which have to have a possessor
marker. The idea behind it seems to be that body parts always belong to the possessor
(animal or human being), but when e- is attached, it expresses that the possessor is
unknown and unspecified. An example is shown in (38) (repeated from 4.3.1):
(38)ntorak to eser.
ni=torak to
e-ser
1SG=find ART UNSP-tooth
‘I found a tooth.’[RP-5/7/04-59]One could expect that the morpheme is attached to verbs as well, if the subject is unknown. The examples occurred only in elicitation, but were later considered to be
ungrammatical by the same speaker. Nonetheless, it may be possible that the morpheme attaches to verbs like nouns, because all other personal clitics behave like that.
The relevant example is:
(39)(*)nka vičowokon ti esiaponow niweri-ye.
nka vi=čo-wo-ko-no

1PL=know-COP-ABS-NOM1 DEM1f

1SG=house-LOC
‘We don’t know who entered my house.’e-siapo-no-wo
UNSP?-enter-NOM-COP[RP-1/9/03-65]The verb -siap- ‘enter’ occurs in the nominalized form esipaonow in (39), because it
is part of a relative clause, introduced by the demonstrative ti ‘DEM1f’. Even though I
think it is theoretically possible that e- was also attached to verbs, there is an argument that holds against this hypothesis: There is a homophonous verbal prefix e‘verbalizer’, found frequently (cf. 6.3.1). This might lead to misunderstandings, generally avoided in this slot (the personal proclitics do not compete with any homophonous morphemes at all).
206
However, in Trinitario, the most closely related neighbouring Arawak language, eti exists as a pronoun
or article for 3SGm (Salvatierra p.c.).","[336, 337, 338, 339, 340]"

This pair of examples shows the difference in scope that results from the differently
ordered combinations. In (128) kač ‘GO’ has scope over the following phrase, including the particle avik ‘again’. Thus it means ‘he went to run again’. In (129) the particles occur in inversed order and thus the first element avikoe’, which is emphasized
and may thus also be analyzed as an adverb, has scope over the following phrase:
‘again they went …’.
Another particle that can be combined with various other particles is rom ‘IMM’,
which can be followed by ver ‘PERF’ (130), kač ‘GO’ (131), ito ‘PROG’ (132), and avik
‘REP’ (133):

Nonetheless, there are probably even more possible combinations.
The imperative particles ši ‘HORT’, pa ‘GO’, or ta ‘JUSS’ are not combined with
other preverbal particles at all. Instead of a preverbal particle the verbal suffixes can
be added. In (134) e.g. the verb is preceded by the cohortative ši ‘let’s’ and marked
by the repetitive suffix -poreiy. Even though in other cases the particle avik ‘REP’ can
replace -poreiy, the sequence of *ši avik ‘let’s again’ before the verb is ungrammatical.

The maximum sequence of combined preverbal particles that I found in the data is

other particles and so can ver ‘PERF’.

‘And recently we are remembering.’[GP-21/7/04-17]The negative particle can be added to some particle combinations. But in general the
preverbal particles occur in affirmative and not in negative clauses. In addition, other
negative adverbs may substitute a combination of the general negative particle and
another aspectual or modal particle, such as nka avik ‘not again’ is generally substituted by porok ‘never (again)’. The position of nka is before the other particles, except for ver, which it mainly follows. Here is one example with the negative particle
and a particle combination so that the position of nka ‘NEG’ becomes clear:

DEM2mThe adverb porok ‘never’ belongs to a small number of adverbs that can sometimes
be inserted between the particle and the main verb. Other such adverbs are imir
‘very’, maiy ‘much’, and verek ‘never ever’. In the beginning I was not sure if these
adverbs could not be grouped together with the preverbal particles as well, but I think
they are simply frequently used adverbs and show some of the syntactic characteristics of the grammaticalized preverbal particles. The insertion of the adverbs maiy
‘much’ and imir ‘very’ before the verb and the non-verbal predicate is shown in
(138) and (139):

In this chapter the Baure closed word classes are listed and described in some detail.
As claimed in Chapter 3, closed word classes are adverbs, demonstratives, pronouns,
interjections and discourse particles.
8.1. Adverbs
Adverbs in Baure were defined in 3.8.4. The main characteristics of adverbs are the
following: Many adverbs are monomorphemic, but they do not have a word class
specific form. By their form, adverbs look like nouns, and some adverbs, e.g. time
adverbs, may be accompanied by a determiner. Other adverbs show an internal morphological structure, but they are treated, like monomorphemic adverbs, as lexical
units. Adverbs are always independent lexemes and they differ from nouns because
they cannot be pluralized, nor have the locative suffix attached, nor form compounds.
In addition, nouns function as arguments in the clause, whereas adverbs are adjuncts.
Some adverbs have been derived from verbs, but in contrast to verbs, adverbs cannot
carry any person cross-referencing clitics. On the other hand, adverbs, just like
nouns, can be turned into non-verbal predicates with possible subject marking by
encliticization. This is in fact restricted to a part of the adverbs, namely in Baure, the
majority of adverbs are temporal, described in 8.1.2, but further there is a small class
of place adverbs, described in 8.1.1, and a large class of clause or phrasal adverbs of
different kinds, referred to in 8.1.3. The whole class of adverbs is closed. A morphological process that frequently occurs with adverbs is emphatic marking (8.1.4). Section 8.1.5 details the relation between adverbs and adjectives.
8.1.1. Place adverbs
Place adverbs form a small closed class. All the elements are morphologically simple, but some of the stems can be reduplicated. Place adverbs can never be preceded
by a determiner. Their position in the clause is relatively free, but most frequently
they are part of the predicate phrase and precede the locative argument marked by -ye
‘LOC’. Examples (1) through (4) demonstrate the possible positioning of the adverb
noiy ‘there’. The same possibilities exist for the other place adverbs in Table 8.1.

‘There where she was making patasca she said: …’
[GP-N1/II-22]
In (1) noiy ‘there’ directly follows the verb, whereas in (2) it follows the argument of
the non-verbal predicate kwe’ ‘exist’. On the other hand, in (3) the place adverb precedes the predicate kwe’ ‘exist’, directly following the clause-initial connector tiwe’
‘but’, and in (4) its position is completely clause-initial. In (2) noiy also precedes a
locative argument, which specifies the location and is marked by -ye ‘LOC’. This is
the most frequent use of the place adverb: followed by a more specific location, either an NP marked by locative -ye or a subordinate clause, such as the cleft construction tiow noiy ‘this is where’ (cf. 10.2.7).
Furthermore, a few place adverbs can be inserted between a preverbal particle and
the verb, as in (5):
(5)ver noiy rokomiračow-hi.
ver
noiy ro=komiračo-wo=hi
PERF there 3SGm=meet-COP=QUOT
‘Then he met (him) there.’[RP-N6-36]The basic forms of the place adverbs can be divided into three different distances –
ne’ ‘here’, noiy ‘there’, and naka ‘over there (far away)’ – which can be compared to
the three different demonstrative pronouns. The further analysis of these place adverbs and the probably related demonstratives is beyond the scope of this grammar.
There is also another adverb meaning ‘there’: nan, and it remains difficult to understand the difference of nan and noiy. It seems as if nan can mean that something is
‘not here’, maybe absent. The adverb nan has also only been found with stative verbs
or predicates, which may be important.
The distal adverb naka’ ‘over there’ generally refers to some place in a nonvisible far distance that someone still has to approach. The possible relation to the
demonstrative pronouns is suggested in Table 8.1, in which all four place adverbs are
represented:

thereTable 8.1: Place adverbs in Baure (in comparison to demonstratives)ten/tin/to nen? ‘DEM3’CHAPTER 8 - CLOSED WORD CLASSES303The relation to the demonstratives is not completely clear. I suspect a formal relation195 between nan and ten/tin, even though the term “distal”, applied to naka’ ‘over
there’ is also used with ten/tin/to nen ‘DEM3’.
The adverb naka’ can be found in two derived forms, as nakon and nakoš. nakon
seems to have been derived by attaching the nominalizer -no ‘NOM1’ to it, and it is
used in many imperative clauses, in which predicates are generally nominalized (cf.
9.3). Therefore it can be assumed that in an imperative clause this adverb may be
marked as well. Observe example (6):
(6)kewon nakon!
ke-wo-no
EV-COP-NOM1
‘Come here!’nak-no
there-NOM1
[DC-16/3/06-39]Example (6) shows that nakon (but also naka) can also refer to a large distance in a
dynamic sense, because it can mean ‘from there’, in other cases ‘to there’; the interpretation of each clause depends on the verb. The use and etymology of nakoš is unclear. There are only very few examples, and the speakers do not seem to make a
great difference between any of the distal adverbs in general196. The adverb naka can
also be reduplicated as nakaka, while noiy and ne’ are not reduplicated.
None of the place adverbs are used in a temporal sense, but one temporal adverb
has been derived from a place adverb by means of reduplication: nanan ‘later’.
Other more specific locative phrases consist of a noun marked by the locative
suffix -ye, which constitutes an oblique object in a clause (cf. 4.8 and 9.1.3). In general, it is not possible to mark a place adverb with the locative -ye, but in one text
type I found an exception (7)197. In a song this rule was ignored and, instead of marking the noun (širinkasowoko ‘rubber plantation’), the adverb ne’ ‘here’ gets the locative suffix attached. This seems to have been a matter of metre in the line, related to
the emphasis on the adverb:
(7)rokačow ne-ye širinkaswoko.
ro-kačo-wo
ne-ye
širinkas-woko
3SGm=go-COP here-LOC
rubber-plantation
‘He went away (here) to the rubber plantation.’[JP-S2-3]8.1.2. Temporal and aspectual adverbs
Time adverbs are numerous in Baure. They are used frequently, particularly because
Baure does not have any morphological way of absolute tense marking. A number of
time adverbs are monomorphemic, as listed in Table 8.2.","[319, 320, 321, 322, 323, 324, 325]"

[HC-2/7/04-40]The juxtaposition of NPs can have many functions. There are also e.g. unmarked
relative clauses, which simply consist of the juxtaposition of two NPs (the apposition
in 10.2.9). Equative and other predicate clauses may be a simple juxtaposition as well
(cf. 5.3.1 and 5.3.2). When a complex argument like the ones described in (22)
through (27) itself becomes a predicate, only the first NP is marked with the copula
or another verbal suffix, as illustrated in (28):CHAPTER 4 - THE NOUN AND THE NOUN PHRASE(28)tič ti retowori to navinon.

[RP-7/7/04-79]The second NP to navinon ‘my husband’ (the possessor) is added here like an oblique
argument, following the fully marked predicate retowori ‘she is his sister’113.
4.4. Number
In Baure singular and plural can be distinguished, singular being the unmarked form.
The plural marker -nev can be applied to any countable noun. This morpheme is unambiguous and is also attached to adjectives (cf. 4.9.4). There is also a subgroup of
human nouns that have a slightly different plural marking, the form -anev (cf. 4.4.2).
Unpossessed nouns can be pluralized just like possessed nouns. Furthermore, also
nominalized verbs are pluralized exactly the same way as underived nouns. First I
want to illustrate the forms of pluralized nouns. Then the use of pluralization is described in more detail (4.4.3).
4.4.1. Pluralization
Due to the preference of CVCV in Baure, the usually deleted word final vowels of
the singular forms of nouns are retained before the suffix -nev, as the plural suffix has
an initial consonant. For the orthographical representation this means that nouns spelt
with a final consonant in the singular form get an additional -o inserted before the
plural suffix, which is the generally deleted or default vowel word finally. Thus the
noun pari [parj] ‘house’ is pluralized into parinev [parinv] ‘houses’, which only
means difference in pronunciation of the vowel -i. But the word ka’an [kaan] ‘animal’, with a deleted -o word finally114, has the plural form ka’anonev [kaanonv]
‘animals’. Nouns that end in the sequence -iy have been subject to word final metathesis, reversed again in the plural, as e.g. nipoiy ‘my foot’ versus nipoyinev ‘my
feet’. The rules and exceptions of these morphophonological changes have been described in detail in 2.2.1 and 2.5.4. Table 4.9 gives some examples of nouns (unpossessed and possessed, nominalized) with their plural forms:113For more detail on this kind of predicates cf. 5.2 and 5.3.
As the vowel is deleted and phonologically not present, it is not represented in the orthography, cf.
Chapter 2.

vowel, as e.g. nipernev ‘my domesticated animals’ in Table 4.9. Spanish loans are

the case in the following examples:

‘children’but not:*ahi(30)nišečenev
but not: *nišeč(e)
ni=šeče-nev
ni=šeč
1SG=child-PL
1SG=child
‘my children (sons and daughters)’CHAPTER 4 - THE NOUN AND THE NOUN PHRASE129The forms that refer to ‘child’ in (29) and (30) cannot be used in the singular, but
there are suppletive forms, i.e. monči ‘child’ for the unpossessed form and nihin ‘my
daughter’ or nišir ‘my son’ for the possessed forms.
Certain specific nouns that refer to unique items, like celestial bodies, cannot be
pluralized. Generally mass nouns do not get pluralized either, or they have to be derived in order to be countable (33). Consider the following examples:
(31)ses
ses
‘sun’but not:*sesnev
ses-nev

water-place-PL
‘water places’The plural morpheme -nev is longer than suffixes usually are: it consists of two syllables (even though only one is pronounced), which makes it likely to be composed of
two morphemes originally, today not analyzable for us any more. Aikhenvald (1999,
2001) reconstructed “the markers: *-na/-ni ‘animate/human plural’; *-pe ‘inanimate/non-human plural’ ” (Aikhenvald 2001: 173) for Proto-Arawak. The Baure
form -nev (formerly given as -nebe – Asis Coparcari 1767, Magio 1749) may have
evolved from a combination of these two distinct suffixes: *-ni + *-pe = *-nipe > nebe > -nev (current form), and the human/ non-human distinction has become equalized in Baure. There is no clear distinction of human versus non-human or animate
versus inanimate nouns in Baure, even though there remains the subgroup of human
nouns with slightly different plural marking (4.4.2).
4.4.2. Human plural
As mentioned above, there is a small subgroup of human nouns that have a different
plural marking, namely with the suffix -anev ‘hPL’. This morpheme has probably
been composed of the linking morpheme -a ‘LK’ and the general pluralizer. This plural marker is predominantly applied to kinship terms, but also to a few other human
nouns, such as eton ‘woman’ and hir ‘man’, which form the plurals etonanev
‘women’ and hiranev ‘men’. But not all human nouns are part of this subclass, only a
well defined restricted number. There also seems to be a phonological restriction insofar that only nouns terminating in a consonant (or a deleted final vowel -o) get this
plural marker attached, whereas human nouns terminating in a vowel get the common
form -nev attached as the other nouns. Therefore the noun nipiri ‘my sibling’ is pluralized as nipirinev ‘my siblings’, and ni’aiy ‘my brother (of a woman)’ as ni’ayinev
‘my brothers’. In Table 4.11 all the human nouns that are pluralized differently are
listed:BAURE: AN ARAWAK LANGUAGE OF BOLIVIA130SINGULARhir

Plural does not seem to be obligatorily marked on every noun or NP that refers to a
plurality of items, just like in Arawak languages. Aikhenvald (2001:173) argues that
“plural is optional (unless the referent is human)” in North Arawak languages. This
seems to hold for Baure as well. Nouns with human referents are generally pluralized
when the speaker refers to more than one. However, the influence of Spanish on
Baure for approximately 300 years has had the effect that today many Baure speakers
who want to speak correctly have started to apply the plural suffix obligatorily to
every noun with a plural interpretation, like in Spanish, at least in elicitation. This
does not seem to reflect the original use of Baure plural marking. In narratives and
when the speakers are in conversation, plural is marked under different conditions
than in Spanish115. Generally, nouns unmarked for plural refer to either a single item
(one token) or to the concept as a mass (the type). All characters in a narrative have to
be marked when they are plural; unmarked nouns cannot refer to an individualized
plural. Domesticated animals, which are often bread in herds or groups, are usually
referred to by the unmarked (generic) form, as e.g. tiporek ‘chicken’ in (34) through
(36).

[JC-14/3/06-43]On the other hand we can notice a Baure-like generic use of singular/unmarked forms in the regional
Spanish as well, which intermingles with the lack of final -s (among others the plural morpheme)
pronunciation.","[147, 148, 149, 150, 151, 152]"

"CHAPTER 4 - THE NOUN AND THE NOUN PHRASE153The bound form -api ‘underside’ in (116) is possessed, and the possessor marker ro‘3SGm’ agrees with the noun to siy ‘the chair’, so that the locative relation becomes
clear.
In many cases it is possible to construct both, the compound and the partitive
locative NP, with the same noun stem. In some cases the specific place noun stem
cannot be bound into a compound, so that only the partitive construction can be used.
This is true for the noun ani ‘sky’, also used to refer to the space above an object. As
an obligatorily free form it cannot be bound into a compound, as demonstrated in
(117) in comparison to (118):
(117) *siyani-ye

+Table 4.19: Locative noun stemsThe forms ačiwani ‘different place’, -širiwani ‘behind’ and -poewani ‘next to’ both
include the morpheme -wani, which seems to mean something like a general ‘place’
or ‘space’. The basic forms -širi ‘behind’ and -poe ‘down’ are the ones incorporated
into verbs. The form -imir- ‘in front’ is derived from the same bound noun stem for
the body part -imir ‘face’. The same form can also be incorporated into verbs. The
bound root -še is derived from a part of a tree, namely the ‘tree branch’. Most of the
place noun stems are also used as classifiers or at least as bound roots that can be
incorporated into verbs and attached to adjectives. These roots are generally not attached to numerals and quantifiers and the word po- ‘other’.
The two spatial noun stems -šinie ‘pointed end’ and -čipi ‘top, roof, back’ show
different behaviour with body parts: they construct inverse compounds. Unexplicably, the bound forms occur as N1 in a compound with a body part, whereas they are
the head N2 in compounds with other nouns. Examples (119) and (120) are inverse
compounds with body parts, which can be compared to (121) and (122):154BAURE: AN ARAWAK LANGUAGE OF BOLIVIA(119) nišiniewhiso-ye

One further kind of locative construction is based on an adjective: ikiy-CLF-ye ‘in the
middle of’. There is always a classifier attached to the stem ikiy- ‘middle’; altogether
it is marked by locative -ye, as in (123):
(123) ikiyaki-ye
ikiy-aki-ye
middle-CLF:diameter-LOC
‘in the middle of the lagoon/river/etc.’
The position of the locative NP in a clause is discussed in 9.1.3.
4.8.2. Semantic extension of locative marking
In many languages the concepts of time and space are related. In Baure, however,
there is not much evidence for a connection of the two concepts. It could be expected
that locative marking could also be attached to time adverbs or nouns, but this seems
to be impossible. Only the adverb nakiroko-ye ‘once upon a time’ may be analyzed as
including the locative suffix. The names of the months can be used as temporal containers, as illustrated in (124), possibly calqued on Spanish. Also the week is interpreted as a time container (125):

encliticsFigure 6.3: Valency-increasing base affixes6.5.1.1. The causative prefix i(mo)- ‘CAUS’
The causative form adds an object to the verb phrase: the so-called causee. The subject proclitic takes the role of the causer; the causee or performer of the action is the
object enclitic. A transitive verb may thus be turned into a ditransitive verb. It should
be possible to add another object of the action, which follows the personal object
enclitic (even though there are no examples in the data). With ditransitive verbs the
order of the objects is recipient–patient (cf. 5.1.3). In causative verbs this holds for
causee–patient as well, as in (117):
(117) pimoekomorikonir
pi=imo-ikomoriko=ni=ro
2SG=CAUS-kill=1SG=3SGm
‘You make me kill it/him.’
The causative in Baure is marked by one of two prefixes: i-/imo-. The choice is phonologically driven: monosyllabic or disyllabic verbal stems tend to get the shorter
form of the causative prefix, i.e. i-, whereas the majority of verbs (many of them derived) get the causative prefix imo-. The forms derived by i- are generally more lexicalized, as in (118), and object marking is not obligatory.
(118) ninikiri.
ni=i-nik=ri
1SG=CAUS-eat=3SGf
‘I feed her (lit. I make her eat).’[GP-11/8/04-79]It is sometimes difficult to identify the short causative prefix i-, since it is phonologically assimilated by the personal proclitics, which tend to end in the vowel -i (cf. Table 8.9), except for two of them, as in (119) and (120):
(119) nisiap ač retorok nkomiračowor.

‘When I finish sweeping, I put it in (back into the room).’ [RP/EC-17/7/04-87]
Other verbs to which this causative prefix is attached are -nik- ‘eat’, -šim- ‘arrive’, -pin- ‘flee (run)’, -hirop- ‘dance’, -yon- ‘walk’. I will assume that the short
causative prefix has been lexicalized in the following verbs: -išoera‘cook’, -ikomorik- ‘kill’, -išom- ‘stand up’, and -iyin- ‘teach’. The causative prefix
imo- is used with most verbs, as e.g. in (121) and (122):
(121) pimokotorekowoni.
pi=imo-kotoreko-wo=ni
2SG=CAUS-work-COP=1SG
‘You make me work.’[RP-7/7/04-37](122) pimokokavi.
pi=imo-koka-wo=pi
2SG=CAUS-laugh-COP=2SG
‘You make me laugh.’[RP-7/7/04-10]In some examples this causative form may also have been lexicalized, as
in -imohinok- (CAUS-see) ‘show’, -imohirik- (CAUS-sit) ‘seat’, or simply in combination with other grammatical morphemes in example (123):
(123) nimowanapi
ni=imo-wana=pi
1SG=CAUS-DEP=2SG
‘I leave you.’[RP/EC-D3-8]The causative can be extended to mean to help or assist someone do something, as
was also argued for one causative form in the Arawak language Nomatsiguenga
(Wise 1986: 593), cf. (124):
(124) roempihinokiawor.
ro=imo-pihino-ki-a-wo=ro
3SGm=CAUS-cross-CLF:diameter-LK-COP=3SGm
‘He is helping him cross the river (lit. He makes him cross the river).’
[RP-7/7/04-125]
The distinction between two different kinds of causative affixes, as in Nomatsiguenga (Wise 1986: 593) is not observed in Baure, even though a kind of co-agent
causative can be derived with the applicative suffix (cf. 6.4.3). It is also possible that
the two causative affixes i- and imo- originally were semantically or functionally
different morphemes. But now they should be analyzed as allomorphs and in complementary distribution.
There is also an analytic construction with the verb -won- ‘send’ which can replace the morphological causative, compare (125) and (126):252BAURE: AN ARAWAK LANGUAGE OF BOLIVIA(125) rowononi royonpoek.

[GP-9/4/06-108]
6.5.1.2. The benefactive suffix -ino ‘BEN’
The benefactive suffix -ino ‘BEN’ also changes the role of the cross-referenced object,
the person for the benefit of whom the action is performed, or the recipient of the
product of the action (beneficiary). All transitive verbs can thus be changed into
ditransitive verbs that show double object marking, just like the ditransitive verb -pa‘give’. Examples of benefactive verbs are (127) and (128):
(127) nki’inow nakpinopi.
ni=ki’ino-wo
ni=ak-pi-ino=pi
1SG=want-COP 1SG=sing-words-BEN=2SG
‘I want to sing (a verse) for you.’
(128) pitoenoni.
pi=ta-ino=ni
2SG=weed-BEN=1SG
‘You weed for me.’[JP-9/7/04-2][GP-11/7/04-37]Double object marking can be observed in (129):
(129) niwo’ikinovir.
ni=wo’ik-ino-wo=pi=ro
1SG=butcher-BEN-COP=2SG=3SGm
‘I butcher it for you.’[GP/LO-21/07/04-96]After verb bases ending in the syllable -no, the benefactive suffix is reduced to -no
(instead of assimilation as -eno after -o), as in (130):
(130) roemonononi nisopot.
ro=imono-no=ni
ni=sopot
3SGm=buy-BEN=1SG
1SG=shoe
‘He bought shoes for me (lit. He bought me my shoes).’[GP-11/7/04-25]The same morpheme may also have a malefactive meaning, as in (131) and (132),
depending on the verb’s semantics:
(131) novepinoni.
no=vepi-ino=ni
3PL=tell.lies-BEN=1SG
‘They are lying to me.’[RP-7/7/04-1]CHAPTER 6 - VERBAL MORPHOLOGY(132) nka viyorinokokow
nka vi=yori-ino-koko-wo
NEG
1PL=be.angry-BEN-RCPC-COP
‘We don’t argue (lit. We aren’t angry with each other).’253[MD-2/4/06-16]The benefactive is thus like an applicative suffix, which in some cases simply derives
a transitive verb from an intransitive one, and it competes with the more general applicative suffix -čo. In (132) the valency has been reduced again by the reciprocal
suffix -koko ‘each other’.
The speakers frequently use the possessive pronouns as an analytic form to replace the morphological benefactive, as in (133):
(133) nayawor vitir viti’ – nayinovi – nayinovir.
ni=aya-wo=ro
vitir viti’ ni=ay-ino=vi
1SG=desire-COP=3SGm 1PLP 1PL 1SG=desire-BEN=1PL
ni=ay-ino=vi=ro
1SG=desire-BEN=1PL=3SGm
‘I desire it for us – I desire for us – I desire it for us.’[GP-21/7/04-24]6.5.2. Aspectual affixes
There are at least eight base suffixes (nine including the temporary suffix), most of
them related to the aspect or direction of the situation; only -ša ‘IRR’ is a mood suffix.
All of these base suffixes are attached externally to the verb base and the valencyincreasing affixes (cf. Figure 6.3). In Table 6.23 all possible combinations are indicated. Some morphemes are mutually exclusive, as e.g. -wana ‘DEP’ and -wapa
‘COS’. The base suffixes occur in the order presented in the table. However, as mentioned above, the base suffixes can also be attached to the root or stem. In such a case
the order of the morphemes is related to the level where they attach. In the example
of the verb -nowana- ‘say goodbye’ with the lexicalized departitive suffix -wana (cf.
(2)) the morpheme -wana may precede the directional suffix -pik ‘COME’. This would
contradict the order indicated in Table 6.23, if -wana ‘DEP’ were to be analyzed as a
base suffix.
(134) ninowanapikowovi.
ni=no-wana-piko-wo=pi
1SG=tell-DEP-COME-COP=2SG
‘I am coming to tell you goodbye.’[GP-9/4/06-78]Table 6.23 illustrates that these base suffixes can be sorted into post-base (Doris
Payne 1990:232) order classes and not semantic classes:BAURE: AN ARAWAK LANGUAGE OF BOLIVIA254-pik-poreiy-wana-wapa-pa-ša-po-woCOMEREPDEPCOSGOIRRPRFLXCOPx

xxTable 6.23: Possible combinations of base suffixes180The suffixes furthest away from the base are the most abstract in meaning. The copula suffix -wo and the perfective/reflexive suffix -po are the most abstract and can
have various effects, depending on the co-occurring suffixes. They can be attached to
nearly any suffix. The scope of the morphemes is always from right to the left. The
base suffixes presented in Table 6.23 are described in detail below.
6.5.2.1. Stative suffixes: the temporary suffix -wa ‘TEMP’
The suffix -wa ‘TEMP’ for brief duration or temporariness (Baptista & Wallin
1967:65) is very rarely used on its own, but more often in the combinations -wapa
‘change of state’ and -wana ‘departitive’. Baptista & Wallin may have deduced the
meaning of -wa by separating these complex morphemes, but -wapa ‘COS’ and -wana
‘DEP’ are fixed units or complex suffixes; there does not even seem to be a suffix
*-na, and their meaning does not seem to have been derived directly from the parts of
the compound.
It is however frequently possible to misinterpret a sequence of -wo and the linker
-a, which assimilate into -wa, as one unit. This may also explain that Baptista &
Wallin have analyzed it as a separate morpheme. But it is also possible that it is sim-180The gray columns refer to non-stative suffixes.","[272, 273, 274, 275, 276]"

[IS-12/4/03-16]As shown in (104), other verbal suffixes are simply attached to ko- ‘ATTR’. The emphatic suffix may only be attached word finally. The clause in (104) is translated as a
possessive clause, which is caused by the possessor proclitic on the NP reyon ‘his
wife’ (cf. 5.3.5).
5.3.4. Locative clauses
Location is indicated by the locative suffix -ye (cf. 4.8). There are no simple juxtapositions with a locative interpretation, but the copula predicate kwe’ is needed here as
well. In fact locative clauses are just a specific type of existential clauses, as in (106)
and (107):
(106) ne’ niwohiso-ye kowe’ to kopon.

‘There is a worm in the middle of the orange fruit.’
[GP-16/9/03-21]
Examples (106) and (107) can be considered to be introductory locative clauses, in
which the subject NP is introduced into the context. In other locative clauses, in particular those where the NPS precedes the location, the copula predicate is marked by a
personal enclitic, as in (108):BAURE: AN ARAWAK LANGUAGE OF BOLIVIA200(108) nti’ kwoni ne’ sorati-ye.
nti’ kwo=ni ne’
sorati-ye
1SG exist=1SG here village-LOC
‘I am here in the village.’[HC-3/8/03-1]Strictly speaking, the emphatic suffix is not attached to the existential predicate kwe’
‘exist’ for emphatic marking (cf. Figure 5.3), but presumably because of a phonetically minimal form. The same can be observed when personal enclitics are attached
to kwo- ‘exist’ that undergo the process of final vowel elision. The predicate base has
to be at least disyllabic (or with a heavy vowel or diphthong) in its outcome, for
which reason the emphatic suffix is added in some forms. The paradigm of the
marked existential predicate is therefore slightly irregular, as presented in Table 5.10:

kwone’ (ko-wo=no-i’) ‘they are’. The form kwovi is ambiguous between ‘you are’ or
‘we are’, because of the morphophonological change of the plosive in -pi ‘2SG’ after
the copula suffix -wo ‘COP’ (cf. 2.5.6).
Further examples of the copula predicate with person marking are (109)b and
(110)b, each time contrasted to the neutral form in (109)a and (110)a:

[HC-2/7/04-1]CHAPTER 5 - PREDICATE TYPES AND SPECIFIC PREDICATE CONSTRUCTIONS201Parallel to the negative existential, this type of locative clauses is negated by the
negative particle nka, with the copula suffix and a personal enclitic attached to it.
(111) and (112) are examples:
(111) nti’ nkawoni niweri-ye.
nti’ nka-wo=ni

to be marked: in affirmative clauses the copula predicate base ko- ‘ATTR’ (cf. Figure
5.3) gets the aspectual suffix attached, in negative clauses the negative particle
n(o)ka. In addition, the subject is marked by a personal enclitic. Examples are (113)
and (114):

[HC-L-49][JP-8/7/04-12]5.3.5. Possession
Possession cannot be expressed by the simple juxtaposition of NPs. There are three
main types of possessive clauses: existential possessive clauses, specialized possessive predicate clauses, and possessive clauses based on a verb.
Existential possessive clauses make use of the fact that a subclass of nouns is
obligatorily possessed. An existential clause with a possessed noun can then be interpreted as a possessive clause, as already illustrated in example (104). More examples
are (115) and (116):
(115) kwe’ nišir peron.
kwe’ ni=šir
peron
exist 1SG=son lazybones
‘I have a lazy son/ a son who is a lazybones.’[RP-1/9/03-50](116) teč kwe’ to roea’ ač kwe’ ti ren ač nti’ ver nkawapa to niron.

and 1SG PERF NEG-COS
ART
1SG=parent
‘That one has got a father and a mother, but I don’t have any parents anymore.’
The clauses in (115) and (116) could also be translated as ‘there is a son of mine’ and
‘there is a father of his’ etc. The existential clause type can also be used with unpossessed nouns. In this case the possessive pronoun can function as a possessive
marker, as in (117):
(117) kwe’ pitir kahap? – kowe’.
exist 2SGP manioc exist
‘Do you have manioc? – I have (There is).’[RP-15/8/03-23]Just like negative existential clauses in general, the negative particle with certain verbal morphemes can function as a negative copula predicate in existential possessive
clauses, if followed by a possessed noun, cf. (116). However, there is also another
possibility to construct a negative possessive clause, and this is closely related to
equative clauses (cf. 5.3.1). Instead of attaching the copula or another stative suffix to
the negative particle, it can be added to the possessed noun, as in (118):
(118) nti’ nka nihinow, nka niširow, nka nišečenew.
nti’ nka ni=hino-wo
nka ni=širo-wo
1SG NEG 1SG=daughter-COP NEG 1SG=son-COP
nkani=šeče-nev-wo
1SG=child-PL-COP
‘I don’t have a daughter, I don’t have a son, I don’t have any children.’
[JI-22/8/03-52]
The difference between negative equative/attributive and possessive clauses is that in
possessive clauses there is no personal enclitic attached. Compare the different meanings of the two clauses in (119):
NEGpossessive
(119) a. nka niširow.
nka ni=širo-wo
NEG
1SG=son-COP
‘I don’t have a son.’equative/attributive
b. nka niširowor.
nka ni=širo-wo=ro
NEG
1SG=son-COP=3SGm
‘He is not my son.’The only, but substantial difference between the two clauses in (119) is the additional
enclitic -ro ‘3SGm’ in the equative clause (b). However, with an explicit NPS the
equative/attributive predicate can also lack the enclitic.
Possessive predicate clauses are constructed on the basis of the possessive pronouns, unrelated to the following noun, which may be possessed or unpossessed. The
copula or another verbal suffix is attached to this possessive pronoun, as in (120)
through (122):CHAPTER 5 - PREDICATE TYPES AND SPECIFIC PREDICATE CONSTRUCTIONS(120) a. ritirow na’.

[RP-N6-37]In example (120)b the possessive pronoun is a modifier in contrast to predicate use in
(120)a. The construction is actually an equative clause on the basis of the possessive
pronoun. The possessed element referred to by NPs in (120) through (122) can also
be pronominalized by an enclitic, as in (123):
(123) ver rotirowore’ to hekoewok!

ARThekoewok

[RP-N6-35]The predicate based on a possessive pronoun can also be used without specifying
possession. This is a kind of absolute claim, which is generally only used in the negative form and together with quantifiers, as in (124) and (125):

exclusively used with unpossessed nouns, as already indicated by example (122) with

(ATTR + ring). The verbal possessive construction can be used like any other verb, as

"CHAPTER 9 - CLAUSE TYPES AND UTTERANCE STRUCTURES3759.6. Special strategies in conversation and narration
One of the main strategies in conversation and narration is the repetition of the main
predicate. This repetition is found in answers to questions or requests, but also for
showing approval of a statement, and finally, to indicate the actual repetition or duration of events. In example (175) one type of repetition is demonstrated:
(175) (ač rikew-hi riti’:) “nka pehmoekpap?”
ač
ri=ke-wo=hi
riti’ nka pi=ehmoek-pa-po
and 3SGF=EV-COP=QUOT 3SGf NEG 2SG=wash.clothes-GO-PRFLX

“heni, nehmoekpap, nen.”
heni ni=ehmoek-pa-po
ni=en
yes
1SG=wash.clothes-GO-PRFLX 1SG=mother
A: ‘ “Yes, I go wash clothes, mother.” ’[GP-N1/II-8/9]As (175) shows, the predicate in the question pehmoekpap ‘you go wash clothes’ is
repeated in the answer with the different subject marking: nehmoekpap ‘I go wash
clothes’. In a real conversation we can sometimes observe how one speaker says
something and the second speaker picks up the last part or the last main predicate,
repeats it and perhaps adds something. Then the first speaker again picks up the last
bit and uses it as the beginning of the new oration. Example (176) is taken from a
dialogue between Dolores Chimanacay (DC) and Asunta Durán (AD), which I overheard as I started recording.

generally coincides with the repetitive or durative character of the action. In (177)
one such typical example is shown, in which the verb noyonop ‘they walked’ is repeated three times.

9.7. Clausal enclitics
There are three pragmatic clausal enclitics: quotative -hi, emphatic or exclamative -niš ‘well’, and the approval marker -enš. The three clitics may also all attach to
one word or attach in various positions. If there are more than one on a word, they
can only occur in one possible order, as represented in Figure 9.7:
word =niš=hi=enšFigure 9.7: The order of clausal clitics on one element:Now each of the clausal clitics is described in some more detail.
The emphatic or exclamative enclitic -niš ‘well’ may also be considered a phrasal
clitic. It can attach to any kind of element in the clause that is emphasized, and generally attaches to the predicate. Semantically it is a clausal clitic in my analysis, because it affects the whole clause. There are many examples with -niš in this chapter:
(82), (109), (115), (121), and (122). All of these examples are interrogative clauses,
in which this enclitic is mainly found. It is generally translated as ‘well’ or ‘then’.
However, sometimes it can also have a different modal interpretation, as in (178),
repeated from (122) above:
(178) vikičin-niš viti’ ne’?
vi=kiči-no=niš
viti’
1PL=say.do-NOM1=EXCLA 1PL
‘What shall we do here then?’ne’
here
[JP-N9-22]CHAPTER 9 - CLAUSE TYPES AND UTTERANCE STRUCTURES377The same question without the enclitic – vikičin viti’ ne’? – would be translated as
‘what are we doing here?’. The attachment of the exclamative clitic leads to a slightly
different interpretation, namely a question that is asking for advice what to do.
The enclitic can also be used in exclamative (179) or affirmative (180) clauses.

‘My throat was aching, because well, I was hot and I drank that water, you

[GP-9/4/06-20]PERFIn (180) there are two clausal enclitics. For the approval marker -enš take note of
(187) and (188).
It seems to be the case that the clitic -niš is composed of the two elements -n
and -iš, because the latter may occur in isolation. Unfortunately I could only get examples in elicitation concerning the difference between -niš and -iš. Dolores Chimanacay argued that the clitics make the difference illustrated in the different answers below:
(181) pamoni te!

‘Yes (I already did).’
‘Yes (I will do it).’
[DC-9/3/06-19]
In spite of the different meanings and the different forms I tentatively analyze them
as identical clitics, because the reduced form exclusively occurs in this kind of answer to the adverb ver ‘already’.
Quotative -hi is predominantly a second position clitic, but the element it attaches
to has to have some verbal quality, which is true for all verbal and non-verbal predicates, but also for demonstrative pronouns (184) and adverbs or preverbal particles
(183). It is generally found in narration when quoting someone. There it attaches extremely frequently to verbs of utterance. In Spanish the speakers translate it as disqué, which has been derived from dice que ‘(he) said that’. Some typical examples
from narratives are found in (182) through (184):BAURE: AN ARAWAK LANGUAGE OF BOLIVIA378(182) rokičowor-hi: “piti’ nkompar mehoewokon.”

‘And the snake wanted to relax (in the tortoises’ house) and she (the tortoise)

[RP-N5-2]
The quotative clitic -hi generally occurs in the clauses that are statements of the narrator about the characters in the story. I further suppose it was also used in direct
speech as a kind of evidential, even though there is only one example (188) in my
data. In this example Guillermina (GP) is repeating me (SD), but marks the cited
clause with the quotative enclitic, because she does not agree with me. The topic was
the capacity of speaking Baure.

GP: ‘She doesn’t know yet, whe says! (laughing, talking to her husband)’
[GP-2/4/06-18/19]
The use of a different aspect (-wapa ‘COS’) in Guillermina’s clause is possibly a correction.
The quotative clitic abounds in narratives, and can also occur more than once in a
clause. I found an example with four occurrences in a single clause (186):
(186) boen, teč-hi rišir-hi mončiw-hi hir-hi.
boen teč=hi
ri=šir=hi
monči-wo=hi
hir=hi
well DEM2m=QUOT 3SGf=son=QUOT child-COP=QUOT man=QUOT

[SIL-N3-7]
The clitic -enš occurs only clause-finally, and is used to seek approval by the listener.
It can be compared to English ‘you know’. It is also an emphatic element. It is possi-CHAPTER 9 - CLAUSE TYPES AND UTTERANCE STRUCTURES379ble that it is somehow related to the formally very similar clitic -niš. There are two
examples in (187) and (188), and another one was already given in (180):

The combination of at least two clausal clitics on one word is frequent. I do not have
any example in the data, in which all three of them occur on one word, but it would
theoretically seem possible. Examples of two combinations are given in (189) and
(190):
(189) rokew-niš-hi.

‘He said to him (, it is said), you know.’[DC-9/3/06-28][RP-N3-158]10. Clause combining and clause embedding
This chapter will describe different types of clause combining and embedding in
Baure. Clause combining includes coordination and subordination, which can be represented by various kinds of constructions. A subordinate clause is not necessarily an
embedded clause. Matthiessen & Thompson (1988) argue that clause combining has
to be differentiated from clause embedding and that a clause generally called “subordinate” with a connector (conjunction) is not a constituent of the main clause (thus
not embedded), but a clause related to the main clause in a certain relation (Matthiessen & Thompson 1988:278, 279).
The chapter is organized in three main parts, differentiated according to how
clause types can formally be distinguished in the Baure language, so that similar constructions are found in the same section. The three main parts comprise a description
of clause combining with a connector (10.1), relative clauses and other marked subordinate clauses (10.2), and multiple predicate constructions, including predicate and
clause chains, complementation, and serial verbs (10.3).
Before each clause combination type is discuss in detail, some general remarks
about the predicate in subordination have to be made. The only marked predicates in
subordination are relative clauses and to some extent complement clauses. The predicates can be marked by nominalization; the relative clause in Baure is in fact a nominalized predicate and therefore an argument of the clause in headless relative clauses,
and a nominal modifier in relative clauses with a head. In complementation there is
one smaller group of verbs that take a verb complement without nominalization (subordinate marking). In this case the complement verb shows subject cross-reference by
a proclitic, and the verb base is complete, but in general there is no or only reduced
aspectual marking by base suffixes (compare Figure 6.1). Nonetheless, the subordinated complement verb still looks exactly like a main verb. This is important to mention, as in other languages we may find an infinitive or participle form or a somehow
reduced unmarked form in complementation. There is an open group of verbs that
take complements with marking. The complements in those cases are transformed
into a nominal argument by action nominalization with the morpheme -čo.
In predicate chaining or juxtaposition and in serial verb constructions each verb is
marked as if it were a main verb standing on its own. Serial verb constructions may
consist of three verbs in a chain, each of them equally marked by a subject proclitic
and possible aspectual morphemes. The difference between a predicate chain (10.3.1)
and a serial verb construction (10.3.3) is the fact that in predicate chaining231 different events can be identified for each of the predicate, whereas in serial verb constructions there is only one event described by a complex predicate that consists of more
than one verb. The latter can be regarded as a kind of verbal apposition, generally
with a more general verb coming first, followed by one or two more specific verbs,
meant to specify the event (such as go-walk-walk barefoot). Nominal appositions are
used frequently instead of relative clauses. Serial verbs seem to have the same function in relation to the verb or predicate.
231
This is not the same kind of predicate chaining that has been called “medial construction”, as in Papuan
languages and others (compare Longacre 1985:272).","[396, 397, 398, 399, 400, 401, 402, 403]"

are some words that refer to the day, the night and the times of the day, which are
probably both nouns and adverbs. I could also analyze them as nouns being used as
time adverbs, but I am really not sure which category they better fit in. All the words
used for the times of the day are represented in Figure 8.1:sunrise

it seems to be a nominalized verb199. The word yotoer may also include a person enclitic -ro. However, yotoe(r) ‘night’ and roseskoner ‘day’ are most likely to be nouns
used in adverbial phrases. They occur more frequently with a determiner, while ahikowon ‘in the early morning’, ča’ape ‘late morning’, reitonoe’ ‘midday’, koeskoe’
‘early afternoon’, and kope’ap ‘late afternoon’ are hardly ever used with a determiner.
Time adverbs are mainly found in clause-initial position, but may also occur at
the end of a clause. They generally do not get inserted within the predicate phrase or
between predicate and arguments. There are two examples in (8) and (9):

[JP-20/8/03-47]Some of the time adverbs can be derived as an emphasized form with emphatic marking, such as e.g. nerikikoe’ ‘right now’ (< neriki ‘now’), or with double emphatic
marking, such as romoekoe’ ‘very soon, right thereafter’ (< rom ‘soon’ via romoe’
‘very soon’). Besides the emphasis there is no meaning change in these derived
forms. Only in the case of the already mentioned nanan ‘later’ (< nan ‘there’) a new
lexeme has been created through reduplication.
Another interesting meaning change is the past reference when the copula suffix -wo is attached: pahare’ generally means ‘day after tomorrow’, but in the form
paharew (pahare + -wo) it is translated as ‘day before yesterday: The same holds for
other adverbs derived from the adjectival root po- ‘other’, like e.g. pomorekoe’ ‘next
year’ and pomorekoew ‘last year’ (not included in Table 8.3). One could probably
hypothesize that if po’itinew means ‘two nights ago’ with the copula word finally and
past reference, then there is probably also a possible lexeme *po’itin(e) ‘other night
(night after next night)’.
8.1.3. Other adverbs
Other adverbs include the adverbs of degree, intensity and quantity (Table 8.4), and
epistemic, modal and other phrasal adverbs (Table 8.5).","[326, 327, 328]"
"CHAPTER 8 - CLOSED WORD CLASSES3238.4.1. Interjections
Interjections form a closed class of words in Baure. They “are words, often of an exclamatory character, that can constitute utterances in themselves, and that usually
have no syntactic connection to any other words that may occur with them”
(Schachter 1985:58). As all Baure speakers are bilingual in Spanish, there is also frequent use of Spanish interjections. When people just start using Baure again with me,
or in elicitation the Spanish forms sometimes get mixed into Baure (a kind of codeswitching). Generally, the more the speakers reconnect to the Baure language again,
or the longer they talk exclusively in Baure, the more Baure specific interjections pop
up. Some of these interjections are also Spanish loans. (In many cases this does happen with unequal relations, e.g. Quechua interjections in Spanish, Muysken, p.c.).
The Baure interjections have not been borrowed into the local Spanish.
Interjections are used to express surprise, emphasis, pain, hesitation, etc. One of
the most frequent interjections is the hesitation form –ha– ‘HES’, used in pauses between words and sometimes also between clitics and bases. The pauses are a sign of
the speaker’s insecurity or searching for the appropriate lexeme. Since Baure is a
dying language, the speakers generally use this pausal form –ha– quite a lot, mainly
before nouns. Consider the following example, in which the speaker wants to say ‘my
finger is aching’, but he cannot find the word for ‘finger’207.

between subject NP and VP, between particles and main predicate (54), clause initially directly after a connector, such as ač ‘and’, or right before direct speech quotations in narratives (55).

combinability of the two prefixes, and they do not occur together very frequently.
It is possible that there once were more prefixes in Baure than there are today,
given the existence of lexical prefixes. Lexical prefixes are meaningful morphemes
prefixed to another verb stem, sometimes to derive opposites. They are more general
in meaning, not productive, and can only sometimes function as a verb stem themselves. Lexical prefixes are always closer to the stem, and grammatical prefixes must
precede them (compare (19) to (25) below). An example is ve-, which generally
means ‘undo’. It is part of the verb root -veha- ‘undo’. It is combined with a few verb
stems to derive the opposite, like the derivational prefixes de-, dis-, or un- in English:

meanings of these fossilized prefixes are so abstract that a translation for them can
only remain tentative:
(20)(21)rohačomoekir.
ro=ha-čomoe-ko=ro
3SGm=off-shell-ABS=3SGm
‘It (the squirrel) cracks the shell (of the cusi).’

3SGm=back?-ATTR-down-ABS-COP
‘He (the little boy) throws himself down (in anger).’[HC-8/3/06-1][LO/GP-15/7/04-99]Example (21) is derived from (16) above. The grammatical prefix is part of the verb
stem, for which reason the lexical prefix may precede it. In (20) the form -ha- ‘off’
functions as the lexical root, into which the argument is incorporated.
3.3.2. Suffixes
Nominal suffixes include plural, locative, diminutive, augmentative, distributive. The
plural suffix may also be considered to be phrasal rather than purely nominal (cf.
4.4.3). Verbal suffixes comprise aspectual, directional, mood, verbal number, and
valency-changing morphemes. As mentioned above, some suffixes predominantly
attach to roots, stems or bases. This leads to a restriction on their combinability. In
general there are no more than three base suffixes on a verb. Some suffixes can occur
more than once in one and the same word. Some suffixes are category-changing
morphemes, such as the four nominalizers -no ‘NOM1’, -čo ‘NOM2’, -ri ‘NOM3’,
and -pi ‘QNOM’. Some verbal suffixes can function as verbalizers. Verbal suffixes
can be attached to non-verbal bases when these are used as predicates.
Generally suffixes are monosyllabic, like e.g. -wo ‘COP’, -pa ‘GO’, -čo ‘APPL’, -ša
‘IRR’. Only a few suffixes are disyllabic or even trisyllabic and seem to have beenCHAPTER 3 - MORPHOLOGICAL PROCESSES AND WORD CLASSES91composed of other grammatical morphemes originally, such as -wapa ‘COS’, -wana
‘DEP’, -poreiy ‘REP’, -pik(o) ‘COME’.99
Some morphophonological rules apply to suffixes and may change final vowels.
On the other hand, there is quite a lot of homomorphism, as e.g. -čo can be the applicative or the action nominalizing suffix, attached in different slots. Many suffixes are
homophonous with clitics and classifiers: -ri can mean ‘NOM3’ or ‘3SGf’ enclitic; -ro
can be an as yet unanalyzed (derivational?) suffix ‘ro’ and ‘3SGm’ enclitic; -no
‘NOM1’ is homophonous with the enclitic ‘3PL’ and the classifier for ‘human’. However, some suffixes can be distinguished from the homophonous clitics because of the
different morphophonological changes they undergo (cf. 3.4.1).
Suffixation has in common with compounding and incorporation the linking morpheme -a ‘LK’, which may occur in between affixes and between noun roots when
attached to another. Whereas the rules for the application of -a ‘LK’ in noun compounds and incorporation remain unresolved, its application on verbs and non-verbal
predicates is predictable. The linker -a is always attached after a semantically stative
verb or non-verbal base when a non-stative verbal suffix is attached. Compare (22)
and (23):
(22)a. pinikow.
pi=niko-wo
2SG=eat-COP
‘You are eating.’b. pinikpa.
pi=nik-pa
2SG=eat-GO
‘You are going to eat.’(23)a. pive’inow
b. pive’inapa
pi=ve’ino-wo
pi=ve’in-a-pa
2SG=be.hungry-COP
2SG=be.hungry-LK-GO
‘You are hungry.’
‘You are going to be hungry.’The linker is only suffixed in (23)b, because the active suffix -pa ‘GO’ is attached to
the stative base -ve’ino- ‘be hungry’. In contrast, it is neither suffixed to the active
verb -nik- ‘eat’ (22), nor to the stative verb with the stative suffix -wo ‘COP’, as in
(23)a.
3.3.3. Circumfixal collocations
There are no real circumfixes in Baure, but at least two constructions have developed
into something like circumfixal collocations: the numeral po-CLF-š ‘one’ and the passive ko-V-si. The numeral ‘one’ has presumably been derived from the right-bound
form po- ‘other’ and a suffix *-š, which may be related to the exclamative enclitic -(n)iš or another unknown form. The other numerals api- ‘two’ and mpo‘three’ are both simply right-bound roots, to which a classifier is attached. The numeral ‘one’, however, is kind of circumfixed around a classifier, as in (24):99Baptista & Wallin (1967) have split these morphemes up into their possible components, as e.g. -wapa
‘COS’ into -wa ‘TEMP’ and -pa ‘GO’. I think that this separation is not very useful, because the meaning of
the complex morphemes does not directly derive from the meanings of the components. In addition the
speakers seem to perceive them as a unit.","[111, 112, 113]"

[RP-N3-15]The verb in (35) has been nominalized by -no ‘NOM1’ for subordination (cf. 10.2.1).
It now behaves like other stative verbs and non-verbal predicates, inserting the linker
before the morpheme -pik ‘COME’.
Other derived non-verbal predicates are preceded by the privative morpheme mo‘PRIV’. While ko- generally derives verbs, mo- derives adjectives, which are a subclass of nouns (cf. 4.9.3). This is further addressed in 5.2.3.
In Figure 4.1 in Chapter 4 the structure of the noun base was illustrated. When a
noun functions as a non-verbal predicate, the whole nominal word is taken as a predicate base. This means that the plural suffix -nev ‘PL’ is reinterpreted as part of the
predicate base, as in (36):
(36)ačow noti’ powor anenev ver nar’inokopaw koeč ver anenevewapa.

‘I am felling it’Even though the forms naškowor in (37) and (38) are similar, they have to be analyzed as completely distinct kinds of predicates: the base in (38) is the verb -ašok‘fell (trees)’, and the one in (37) is based on the possessed noun našok ‘my grandfather’. Therefore the personal proclitic in (37) is part of the predicate base and not
attached to it. In (38) the personal proclitic is attached to the base and refers to the
subject. In (37) the subject is marked by the enclitic -ro ‘3SGm’. In (38) the enclitic ro ‘3SGm’ refers to the object of the verb. For a further discussion of the semantic
alignment systems in Arawak languages, cf. Danielsen & Granadillo (2007).
5.2.1. Subject marking
Subject marking on non-verbal predicates is pronominal, almost like object marking
on verbs. In general, the predicate lacks subject marking when the subject NP occurs
explicitly in the clause, as in (39) and (40):
(39)(40)verwapa te kanikon.

‘And the glass is empty now and the frog is not there anymore.’ [GP-A4-30]The subject NP may follow or precede the predicate. The predicate bases here are the
adverb or particle, ver ‘already, PERF’, in (39), the adjective hetirik ‘empty’ in (40)
and the negative particle nka ‘NEG’ in (40). The negative particle as a predicate base
is the conventionalized form to express a negative existential, cf. 5.3.3. The same
predicates can have a personal enclitic attached, replacing the explicit subject NP, as
in (41) through (43):
(41)verowaper, nkičowor. pameron, rokičowoni

‘He is not here any more.’[DC-4/4/06-20]As will be shown below, equative and attributive clauses may be expressed by the
juxtaposition of NPs. In such a case the predicate remains completely unmarked,
formally identical to an NP as argument in a clause (cf. 5.3.1 and 5.3.2). However,
the predicate generally has to be marked at least by the copula suffix -wo ‘COP’ before a personal enclitic may be attached141. Exceptions to this rule are adjectives with
the final absolute suffix -ko ‘ABS’, such as hetirik ‘empty’ (42), adjectives derived by
the privative prefix mo- ‘PRIV’ (cf. 5.2.2), and the predicate eto- ‘finish’. Therefore, a
noun can only function as a predicate when a verbal suffix is attached to it, as in (44)
in contrast to (45).

2SG=mother=3SGfThe subject NP may frequently co-occur with subject marking, as in (44), which is
also the case with object marking on verbs. This is possibly more frequent with nonverbal predicates, though.
Any nominalized form can function as a predicate, but there always has to be
some verbal morpheme between the nominal base and the personal enclitic, as in:
(46)nka evririkowonowoni.
nka evri~ri-ko-wo-no-wo=ni
NEG
be.slow~INT-ABS-COP-NOM1-COP=1SG
‘I am not very slow.’[DC-16/4/06-37]The nominalized form evrikowon ‘slow’, derived from the verb -evrik- ‘be slow’,
already contains a copula suffix. But after the nominalizing morpheme -no ‘NOM1’,
which determines the border of the predicate base, the copula suffix is attached again
before the personal enclitic -ni ‘1SG’.
Non-verbal predicates also frequently occur without subject marking, when they
have a general reference, as a general fact, the weather or time. This is illustrated in
(47) through (50):
(47)141hehirewapa.
he-hi-ro-e-wapa
good-WTE-ro-DUR-COS
‘The weather is good.’Instead of the copula any other stative verbal morpheme may be attached.","[203, 204, 205, 206]"

Aikhenvald (1990:98) states that in Arawak languages “any non-verb can be used as
a predicate of existential, locative, equational or attributive clauses”. In this section
these types of predicate clauses are described in detail, summarized in Tables 5.10
through 5.12.
It will be shown that the juxtaposition of two NPs can be enough to construct
complete clauses in some cases, while in others a copula morpheme or copula predicate has to be added to varying elements in the clause. Some constructions are only
used in affirmative, others in negative clauses, again others in aspectually specified
clauses. The least marked case is always an affirmative clause with no time reference
(which gets a present interpretation by default in direct speech).
There is much overlap in the kinds of construction for the different predicate
clause types. The existential construction is for example also used as a locative existential and possessive existential construction. The description starts with equative
(5.3.1) and attributive clauses (5.3.2), followed by existential (5.3.3), locative (5.3.4),
and possessive clauses (5.3.5).
5.3.1. Equation
In equative clauses an NP functions as a predicate. In the unmarked case in an affirmative clause the subject NP (NPS) can stand in juxtaposition with the predicate
NP (NPV). The order of the elements depends on the focus. In equative clauses,
where generally the subject is in focus, the NPS precedes NPV , as in (76) and (77):BAURE: AN ARAWAK LANGUAGE OF BOLIVIA194(76)to Horian ntori.

‘And the daughter of Lucio Oni is his wife.’[JI-22/8/03-42]
Lucia Oni
Lucio Oni
[AD/DC-D2-156]Two NPs in juxtaposition can also be interpreted as the partitive NP construction,
described in 4.3.3. In (77) the second NP, the predicate NP, consists of such a partitive construction rohin to L.O. ‘the daughter of L.O.’. Sometimes it is only the reference and the intonation that distinguish partitive NPs from an equative NP juxtaposition, as in (78):
(78)rokičowori-hi teč rišir, to riavinon tič eton.
ro=kičo-wo=ri=hi

3SGm=say-COP=3SGf=QUOT DEM2m 3SGf=son
tori=avinon
tič
eton
3SGf=husband DEM2f
woman
‘Her son told her, the husband of that woman.’ART[GP-N1/I-24]The partitive NP in (78) could simply not work as an equative clause. It would have
to mean ‘her husband is that woman’, which is meaningless. Thus, in this case reference disambiguates the juxtaposition. Examples (79) and (80) are distinguished by
intonation, indicated above the lines:
(79)ti rihin ti eton
ti
ri=hin
ti
eton
DEM1f 3SGf=daughter DEM1f woman
‘the daughter of the woman’(80)ti rihin ti eton
ti
ri=hin
ti
eton
DEM1f 3SGf=daughter DEM1f woman
‘She is the daughter of the woman.’In (79) there is continuous falling intonation, which is interpreted as a partitive NP,
whereas in (80) the same constituents are interpreted as an equative clause. The
predicate character of ti rihin ‘her daughter’ in (80) is triggered by the rising intonation. In addition the intonation is interrupted and rises again in the subject NP ti eton
‘the woman’. The second time the intonation does not rise as high as the first time,
because intonation generally falls at the end of a clause. When the NPV is in focus, it
may also precede the NPS, as in (81):CHAPTER 5 - PREDICATE TYPES AND SPECIFIC PREDICATE CONSTRUCTIONS(81)nerikikoe’ ti howe’ tič eton.
neriki-ikoe’ ti

now-EMPH DEM1f
dolphin DEM2f
‘The woman was a dolphin now.’195eton
woman
[GP-N1/I-29]In (81) the predicate ti howe’ ‘a dolphin’ is in focus. The woman changes into a dolphin in that narration. It could theoretically also mean ‘the dolphin was a woman’ in
a different context.
In negative clauses and in the majority of affirmative clauses the predicate gets
marked by at least the copula suffix and a personal enclitic referring to the subject.
Other verbal suffixes can also be attached in order to mark aspectual distinctions.
When the predicate is marked by verbal suffixes, its function in the clause is clear,
and the position in the clause can vary. The explicit NPS mainly precedes the NPV,
but it is frequently simply pronominalized by a personal enclitic. In (82) through (84)
the predicates are marked as described:

In clauses with aspect specification, the predicate can be marked by the change of
state suffix -wapa ‘COS’, as in (85), or the intentional suffix -pa ‘GO’ (after the insertion of the linker -a), as in (86).

juxtaposition of attribute and subject NP the NPs follow different rules.
5.3.2. Attribution
In attributive clauses an NP functions as an attributive predicate of the NPS. This NPV
may be a noun or an adjective. Since modifying adjectives may also occur in juxtaposition with the head noun (cf. 4.9) within an NP, predicative adjectives in juxtaposition with another NP have to be distinguishable from modifying adjectives. Most
adjectives follow the head noun within an NP. Therefore predicative adjectives tend
to precede the entire NPS in juxtaposition, as in (87) and (88):
(87)(88)monik tin

big-CLF:flat-AUG DEM1m 1SG=house
‘My house is big.’[JI-14/8/03-49][DC-11/3/06-23]In (87) the predicative and the modifying adjective occupy their different positions. It
is, however, also possible to have a predicative adjective following the NPS, but with
an inserted pause, as in (89):
(89)to eton čišie’

[RP-15/8/03-63]In 4.4.3 it was shown how double plural marking (on the head noun and the following adjective) can lead to the identification of the adjective as a predicate, while an
NP with a modifier only gets marked once at the end of the phrase, take note of (90):

verbal suffixes and a personal enclitic, just like in equative clauses, cf. (92) and (93):

in this neutral form without any cross-reference. This predicate is presumably composed of the following parts:

"14BAURE: AN ARAWAK LANGUAGE OF BOLIVIAnot already exist before christianization. The Virgin Mary has been borrowed as ti
ven ‘the virgin’ from Spanish la Virgen. There are many Baure surnames, such as
Pinaicobo, Churipuy, Imanareico, Cajareico, Ohopi, Buripoco, and Emorisebocono.
However, all personal names are of Spanish origin, but have been adjusted to Baure
phonology, like e.g. Horian for Spanish Julián. Names of newly introduced animals
have also been borrowed, though not all of them. These borrowings are frequently
not perceived as such (as in the case of ‘sheep’: ves from Spanish oveja). More examples are listed in Table 1.2. Animal names that have not been borrowed, at least
not from Spanish, are tiporek for ‘chicken’, simori for ‘pig’, and poeh for ‘duck’.
The phonological explanations for the sound changes in the borrowing process
need a description of Baure phonology in general, which Chapter 2 contains. For
some borrowings in Table 1.2 there are more detailed remarks about the usage of the
loanword, as for instance the loan for ‘table’, which is mes, from Spanish mesa.
There does not seem to exist any alternative Baure word. It must have been borrowed
a long time ago, which can be concluded from the fact that most of the time the word
mes ‘table’ is referred back to by the newly created classifier -mes-. Classifiers occur
in numerals and adjectives and can be incorporated into verbs. Older speakers use the
classifier -amok- ‘flat & raised’ (cf. Appendix A.1). Thus they rather say pamokoš
‘one table’. But most of the younger speakers use the loanword as a classifier and say
pomesis ‘one table’ instead (with phonological change word finally). That mes is
used as a classifier, may also have to do with the fact that it is morphologically simple and disyllabic. A further example is the word haw ‘soap’ borrowed from Spanish
jabón. This loan can be used as a verbal root or incorporated into a verb, as e.g. in
nihawačor ‘I am soaping him’. The loan can also be found in a compound with the
classifier -pa ‘flat & round’, as in hawpa ‘soap paste’. This loan is definitely not
identified as a Spanish borrowing by the speakers today.
In the period between the 18th and the 20th century, Baures lived together with
many Spanish-speaking settlers, who learnt to speak the indigenous language, but
reinforced the inferior status of Baure. This difference in social acceptance had to
lead to the replacement of many Baure words by Spanish near equivalents. The
longer the words have been borrowed, the more they have been integrated into the
Baure phonology and morphology. An example of a rather recent replacement (because phonologically still similar) would be the word avoel for Spanish abuelo/a
‘grandfather/grandmother’, in spite of the fact that there are more specific Baure
words: -ašok ‘grandfather’ and -os ‘grandmother’. There may be an additional reason
for replacements of this kind: Baure grammar is very different from Spanish, and
many speakers have rather adapted the Spanish way of thinking, which sometimes
makes it difficult to understand the much more specific subdivisions of nouns we find
in Baure (cf. Chapter 4). In Table 1.3 there are some of the most frequently used replacements listed with comments on the original Baure words.
The majority of Spanish loans are nouns, but as tables 1.2 and 1.3 show, also
some other parts of speech are borrowed. Spanish borrowings are best identified by
their different phonology, that allows, for example, consonant clusters that do not
occur in Baure otherwise, and that includes different phonemes than we find in
Baure, for instance [l] as in livor ‘book’ derived from Spanish libro. There may alsoCHAPTER 1 - INTRODUCTION15be borrowings from other languages than Spanish, like the word for the bird ‘swallow’ mehelele, the only word with the phoneme [l] in Baure that does not seem to
have a Spanish origin. But there is more evidence for loans from another language
than Spanish. Some words simply do not fit in the typical Baure phonetic or morphological structure, and the morphemes do not seem to carry any meaning elsewhere in
Baure. The items tend to have an alternative word in Baure. Possible examples are
šokoma’ ‘deaf’ – with the two alternatives mosenokier and mosompoekon ‘deaf,
without hearing’ in Baure – and the word -čawriwe’/-čowrie’ ‘leg’, which was only
used by two speakers (and one of them used it only in a narrative) and co-exists with
the alternative -pes ‘leg’ and the more specific names for parts of the leg. It is especially difficult to find out more about the origins of loans because knowledge about
the surrounding languages is either scarce or was not obtained before the languages
became extinct.

Baure: sipor; borrowing contains Baure classifier -i’ (<-oe)’ for birds
There are Baure verbs for this meaning, e.g.soveč-Table 1.3: Replacement of Baure words by Spanish loansThe most recent borrowings of the speakers today are mainly very spontaneous – or
cases of code-switching – of a speaker who cannot find the word and is temporarily
urged to replace it by a Spanish one. Among these borrowings we find elements of all
kinds of parts of speech, many, more specifically, from the class of verbs. These borrowings are not stable or fixed parts of the Baure vocabulary, but they follow certain
rules. For example all borrowed verbs are suffixed by a so-called verbalizer -čo (cf.
Table 1.3), which functions as an applicative suffix in common Baure verbs (cf.
6.4.3). The longer a consultant speaks Baure during a fieldwork session, however, the
less Spanish borrowings of this type occur. A comparable phenomenon accounts for
grammatical constructions: for example benefactive and causative (very unlike Spanish) are constructions rather specific to Baure and unlike the Spanish construction. In
narratives speakers make frequent use of the typical polysynthetic predicates with the
causative prefix or the benefactive suffix, cf. (3) and (4):16BAURE: AN ARAWAK LANGUAGE OF BOLIVIABaure polysynthetic construction

The affixes for causative and benefactive are directly attached to the verb bases. This
process is complicated from the point of view of Spanish grammar. The isolating
constructions, on the other hand, do not derive new verb bases and therefore the
speakers can use these constructions, when they are not acquainted with the morphology of Baure so well any more, but still remember simple verb bases such
as -aya- ‘desire’, -kotorek- ‘work’, and -won- ‘send’.
It is sometimes very difficult to decide if certain constructions have been part of
the Baure grammar already before the intense and constant influence of Spanish. We
have to accept that influences from the side of Spanish have changed the language.
However, Baure speakers are aware of the borrowing of lexical items from Spanish,
and the ones who want to speak perfectly, are very keen to replace all the spontaneous borrowings by Baure words. The isolating constructions of the examples above
are not interpreted as Spanish borrowings.
1.2.5. The name Baure
The name of the language is Baure, the people are called Baures (in Spanish: los
Baures [bar] or [ar]), and the village, which was originally founded24 as Concepción de Baures, is called Baures today. In the literature we find either Baure or
Bauré as names for the language25. What this name means and where it has been derived from is completely unclear and can only be a matter of speculation. In general,
it should always be of some concern where the language name has come from, especially pejorative terms should be avoided26. In the case of Baure it is very difficult,
though. It is not sure if the name has been given by others or if the Baures used it for
themselves, as it is not clear whether it is part of the language at all. One of the theories, that seems a little bit too simple to me, is that the people’s name Baure goes
24
This is not meant to suggest that there had not already been a village and some communities before the
mission was founded, and that they might have had names. It is impossible to gain any knowledge about
the precolonial time in that respect, and the first missionaries must have had little interest in the native
name of the place they chose for the mission.
25
Moxo or Mojo is sometimes used as a synonym, other times it is used as a cover term for Baure and the
Moxo languages. Other synonyms have been mentioned: Maure and Chiquimitica (?) in Wilbert (1994:86);
Chiquimiti in Loukotka (1968:142) and Kaufman (1994:95).

Moxo e.g. may derive from the word for “scabies” (Block; Hervás in Pinto Mosqueira 2002:37).","[35, 36, 37, 38]"

‘Go and wash (him) his face!’[GP-11/8/04-49]5.5. Comparative constructions
There are various types of comparative constructions in Baure, discussed here, as
incorporation plays a major role in comparison. There are three verbs used for comparison: -erok- ‘surpass’, -kovik- ‘catch up with’, and -inok- ‘resemble’.
The verb -erok- ‘surpass’ is used for ‘more than’. The quality compared is generally an oblique object, whereas the arguments compared to another are core arguments, as in (158) and (159):
(158) rerokowoni te čomeki.156

‘He is taller than me (lit. He surpasses me in tall(ness)).’[DC-11/3/06-15]An alternative to (159) is a complex verb, with the quality -š(i)e’ ‘vertical size’ incorporated, as in (160):
(160) rerošekowoni.
ro=iro-še-ko-wo=ni
3SGm=surpass-vert.size-ABS-COP=1SG
‘He is taller than me (lit. He surpasses me by vertical size).’ [MD-12/3/06-23]
The absolute suffix -ko ‘ABS’ follows the incorporated root -š(i)e’ ‘vertical size’, as it
is an instance of Ground incorporation (cf. 5.4). It is theoretically possible that other
bound roots are also incorporated into the verb -erok- ‘surpass’, but unfortunately no
other examples could be elicited. The verb can also be used in a nominalized form, as
with derived adjectives, as in (161), taken from a narrative in which the fox wants to
tell the jaguar that cusi nuts are much better than his flesh, because he doesn’t want to
get eaten:
156The absolute stem suffix -ko is part of the base -erok- ‘surpass’, but glossed separately here for
transparency.","[232, 233, 234]"

‘They aren’t very small (watermelons).’[LO/GP-18/7/04-79]In addition, the particle nka itself is used as a non-verbal base of a predicate. In that
use it can have certain verbal morphemes attached, such as the copula suffix -wo in
nkaw ‘there isn’t’ or the change of state morpheme -wapa in nkawapa ‘there isn’t any
more’. This is mainly used for negative existentials (cf. 5.3.3). The general negative
particle is also used for negating morphological imperatives, as illustrated in 9.3.1
below.
The negator nka is also found in one complex lexeme, namely nka to ka, which
can be translated as ‘no-one’ or ‘nothing’. It is the negation of the indefinite pronoun
to ka ‘someone’ or ‘something’. The complex negative pronoun is significant in specific relative clause constructions (cf. 10.2.8). In addition it is found in negative
clauses of the following type:

IND
1SG=carry-REPN
‘I won’t carry anything anymore.’[JC-6/4/06-26]BAURE: AN ARAWAK LANGUAGE OF BOLIVIA340The complex morpheme nka -poeiy ‘REPN’ (negative repetitive)212 is exclusively
used in negative clauses. It is likely that -poeiy is directly related to -poreiy ‘REP
(again)’. The two morphemes provide an interesting semantic pair that explains the
specific meaning of nka -poeiy, which can be translated as ‘never again in life’ or
‘never ever again’, as pointed out in 6.5.2.8 (and examples (204) and (205) in 6). In
the negated form nka -poreiy ‘not again’ only seems to negate one occurrence, but
unlike nka -poeiy it does not mean a general negation. It is possible that the particles
porok ‘never’ and verek ‘not ever’ have replaced the morphological way of specifying these meanings on the verb.
In some clauses the verbal morphemes attached to the negated clause differ from
those in the affirmative clause. Lexical aspect inherent to the verb base is important
in Baure. Punctual verbs (or achievement verbs, Vendler 1967) are generally used in
the basic unmarked form in the affirmative (34), whereas the negative form always
has to get the copula morpheme attached (35):
(34)(35)ver netorok.

nka ro=etoroko-wo
NEG
3SGm=come.out-COP
‘He didn’t come out.’[DC-3/4/06-16]The verb base -etorok- ‘come out’ cannot be negated with the simple form. The same
holds for verbs such as -šim- ‘arrive’, -aparok- ‘break’, -epoč- ‘burst’, -porok- ‘get
lost’ etc. This is related to the aspectual interpretation of the negated form as a kind
of state: ‘he is in the state of not having come out’ (35). For more information concerning the copula suffix -wo cf. Chapter 6.5.2.4.
9.2.2. The negative particles porok ‘never’ and verek ‘not ever’
There are two particles that could be translated as ‘never’ in English; therefore they
have to be differentiated here. The particle porok means ‘never’, ‘never ever’ or
‘never again’. The particle verek means ‘not ever’ and refers to the future. It can also
be used for an imperative (warning). Both particles have considerably different derivations.
The particle porok has been derived from the identical verb root -porok- ‘get
lost’213. We can still imagine the negative connotation of ‘get lost’, the absence of
oneself, as having served as the source for the negative particle ‘never’. The following example illustrates the use of porok ‘never’ in a declarative clause:212
It could either be analyzed as the morpheme -po ‘PRFLX’ or -pa ‘go’ and the locative suffix -yi.
Unfortunately vowel assimilation causes the same diphthong in both combinations, so that the origin of the
complex morpheme is unclear (cf. . 6.5.2.8).
213
Comparison: Also other preverbal particles, like e.g. intentional kač ‘go’ or repetitive avik ‘again’, have
been derived from verbs, cf. Chapter 7.","[360, 361, 362]"

The direct object that can be part of the clause can occur in the question without
any additional verb that specifies the action, as e.g. an NP that is involved as a patient, as illustrated in (131):

verb root attached to the root -k(i)e- instead of the particle toeri ‘do how’. However,
when other verb roots are part of the predicate, the applicative suffix -čo has to be
added at the end of the base. The addition of this suffix leads to a question about an
instrument ‘what do you V with’, as in (132) and (133):

order to form the predicate -kie-wapa- ‘be in a recent state’. It is used for the question
‘How are you now?’ when someone has been sick. It is striking that this is another
example where the verb root is used to refer to a state (as in (124)–(126)), while in

Questions about a point in time, referring to a past or future event, are constructed
with the question word rekičin ‘when’. It appears at the beginning of the clause. The
time reference can only be inferred from the main predicate and its form. Example

‘When will you come here again?’[GP-16/9/03-96][JC-Q-55]As has been argued, every question involves a nominalized predicate. In this case it is
the question word rekičin ‘when’ itself. It can still be analyzed as a nominalized
predicate on the base of the root -kič- ‘say/do’. It is probably constructed of the following parts: ro-i-kič-no (3SGm-CAUS-‘say/do’-NOM1). In example (137) the rekičini
shows a certain degree of palatalization of the nasal, as it is common in interrogative
clauses. Even though there seems to be a person cross-reference marker on this interrogative predicate (ro- ‘3SGm’), it is unchangeable. Note that the question vikičin
(1PL=‘say/do’-NOM1) means ‘What do we do? (122), and it looks very similar.
The question word has a declarative form as its counterpart, which lacks the
nominalizer: rekič ‘when’. In the following dialogue, taken from a narrative, both
words can directly be compared.

The interrogative predicate can also include other verbal morphemes, such

‘When did you arrive again?’[DC-6/4/06-102]The question rekičin ‘when?’ seems to refer only to an action and a point in time. For
the question that refers to the time of day, e.g. when someone wants to meet, there is
another specific predicate: ro(e)koeshin ‘what time?’, as can be observed in the following excerpt from a narrative:
(140) rokičowori-hi: “ntori, viki’inow woyikow karer? […]” – “boen”, rikiew-hi tič

[RP-N6-4/6]DEM2f tortoiseThe etymology of this interrogative predicate is unclear.
9.4.8. Questions about the quantity of count nouns
This section deals only with the quantity of count nouns. Quantity questions are constructed with the help of a special question word, which again is a nominalized predicate. The subject proclitic is in general ro- ‘3SGm’, but in possessive relations the
subject may refer to the object counted (147). Within the predicate there is a slot for
an incorporated classifier or noun root, which refers to the counted object, as in:
(141) rowokompewon?
ro=woko-mpe-wo-no
3SGm=how.many-CLF:flat-COP-NOM1
‘How many bank notes are there?’[GP-Q-1]The root of the predicate rowokompewon ‘how many bank notes?’, -woko-, probably
consists of the copula -wo and the absolute suffix -ko. Only this specific combination
leads to the meaning ‘how many?’. The classifier -mpe- ‘flat’ is incorporated directly
after the root and is obligatory in that the question of ‘how many’ always refers to a
type that has to be marked on the predicate. The morphemes that follow the incorporated element include TAM specification of the clause. The final nominalization
marks this predicate as interrogative. Note these examples with different classifiers:
(142) rowokonowon to neč čintinev yašor-ye?
ro=woko-no-wo-no
to neč
činti-nev yašor-ye

ro=woko-i-no
3SGm-how.many-CLF:fruit&bird-NOM1
‘How many birds did you find?’367pi=torak
2SG-find
[LO-29/8/03-101]As mentioned above, in a possessive relation the subject marker is different, because
in this case it directly refers to the counted object:
(144) nowokonowon pišečenev?
no=woko-no-wo-no
pi=šeče-nev
3PL=how.many-CLF:human-COP-NOM1 2SG=son-PL
‘How many children do you have? (lit. How many are your children?)’
[DC-16/3/06-37]
In other cases the proclitic even refers to the subject itself. This can be observed in
questions about age: ‘how old are you?’ (145) and in questions about states (146):
(145) piwokmorekewapani?
pi=wok-moreke-wapa-no
2SG=how.many-year-COS-NOM1?

two-day-COP=1SG
DC: ‘How many days I was (there)? I was (there) for two days.’
[AD/DC-D2-83/84]
The questions about the speaker Dolores Chimanacay’s (DC) stay in the city Trinidad
(146) can be directly compared to (147), which also refers to the number of days:
(147) rowokseskonewon teč viaharon?
ro=wok-seskone-wo-no
teč
viaharon
3SGm=how.many-day-COP-NOM1 DEM2m journey
DC: ‘How many days is the journey (to Germany)?’[AD/DC-D2-29]In (147) the interrogative predicate is marked by ro- ‘3SGm’, because it refers to the
journey and its number of days.
9.4.9. Questions about the quantity of mass nouns
Just as in English the questions ‘how many?’ (count nouns) versus ‘how much?’
(mass nouns) are differentiated, the question concerning the quantity of a mass concept is constructed differently than the one described in section 9.4.8. The main element of the interrogative clause, again, is a nominalized predicate that incorporates a
classifier. Here is one example with the mass concept ‘water’, expressed by the classifier for liquids, -ar(o)-:368BAURE: AN ARAWAK LANGUAGE OF BOLIVIA(148) rokotiarowon? – pirihaki.
ro=koti-aro-wo-no
piri-haki
3SGm-how.much-CLF:liquid-COP-NOM1 half-pot.full
‘How much water is there (in the pot)? – Half a pot full.’[GP-21/9/03-5]The root of the predicate that is the base for the question ‘how much’ is -koti-, possibly related to the verbal root -kotir- ‘have’ (cf. 5.3.5). There are not many examples
in the data, but here is one more with the mass concept ‘time’:
(149) pikotiyepowon pikasoer228?
pi=koti-ye-po-wo-no
pi=kasoer
2SG-how.much-LOC?-PRFLX-COP-NOM1 2SG-stay
‘How much time/ How long will you stay (here)?’ [GP-21/9/03-5]
In example (149) the subject marker refers to the subject of the second predicate of
the clause, pi- ‘2SG’, and not to the element to be quantified, like in the case of the
age question (148).
9.4.10. Questions concerning location
Questions concerning location of a predicate are also constructed with a nominalized
predicate. There is no specific question word but only the locative marker -yi, added
to the predicate, and followed by a possible object marker and the obligatory nominalizing suffix. The form of the locative marker on predicates is phonologically
slightly different from the locative marker on NPs, which is -ye, but it seems obvious
that both forms go back to the same source. This interrogative construction is the
same as the locative subordinate construction (cf. 10.2.5). Example (150) demonstrates how questions are constructed:
(150) pitorakiyin te him čopoča?
pi=toraki-yi-no
te
him
2SG-find-LOC-NOM1 DEM1m fish
‘Where did you find this big fish?’čo-po-ča
big-CLF:tiny-AUG
[JC-18/9/03-21]The locative marker in (150) triggers vowel harmony of the preceding vowel that
connects the verb root and the following morphemes (see also (152) below). In general, it can be argued that the locative marker on predicates always produces strong
palatalization and vowel harmony of the environment. As already mentioned, there
may also be object markers included in the nominalized predicate with the locative
marker, as in (151) and (152):
(151) piviyeron?
pi=vi-yi=ro-no
2SG=take.away-LOC=3SGm-NOM1
‘Where did you take this away/ from?’229228
229This verb root -kasoer- is a Spanish loan from quedarse ‘stay’.
In Spanish: ‘¿Dónde lo sacaste?’[JP-12/7/04-8]CHAPTER 9 - CLAUSE TYPES AND UTTERANCE STRUCTURES(152) rokomorokiyivin kove’?
ro=komoroki-yi=vi-no
kove’
3SGm-bite-LOC-2SG-NOM1 dog
‘Where did the dog bite you?’369[RP-6/7/04-3]The questions described so far concern the location of an action. If the location of a
subject is queried, this has to be done with a different construction. One possibility
involves the empty verb root -kie- ‘EV’. The meaning ‘where’ is constructed by a
specific combination of morphemes: -kie-po- (EV-PRFLX). To the base -kiepo- ‘where
(stative)’ no other suffix may be attached, as it would manipulate the meaning. Finally it is nominalized as an interrogative predicate and shows subject crossreference. Consider the following examples:
(153) rokiepon to pavinon?
ro=kie-po-no
to
3SGm=EV-PRFLX-NOM1 ART
‘Where is your husband?’pi=avinon
2SG=husband

to
3PL-EV-PRFLX-NOM1
ART
‘Where are the ducks?’ni=eyon
1SG=wife
[GP-N1/II-42]pohi-nev
duck-PL
[RP-12/9/03-30]The different kind of subject marking in (153) through (155) show how the interrogative predicate refers to the main argument in the clause. The subject argument is also
present as an explicit NP in the examples.
Note further the manipulation of the meaning of the interrogative predicate with
the addition of another verbal morpheme. This can create a predicate like -kie-po-won (EV-PRFLX-COP-NOM1), which refers to the direction ‘where (go) to’. The addition
of the copula -wo in the predicate causes the difference in meaning. Here is one example, which can be compared to (155) above with a stative meaning:
(156) nokiepowon to pohinev?
no=kie-po-wo-no
to
3PL=EV-PRFLX-COP-NOM1 ART
‘Where are the ducks going?’pohi-nev
duck-PL
[RP-12/9/03-27]Finally, there is another way to ask for a location, which also includes the locative
marker -yi and forms a stative locative question. It involves the verb root -avi- ‘live
(be at a place)’, which indicates more permanence than the question -kiepon ‘where
is…?’. This interrogative construction is mainly used when asking for houses or fixed
places, like lakes, rivers etc., but it is also used with persons’ accommodation. Examples:370BAURE: AN ARAWAK LANGUAGE OF BOLIVIA(157) raviywon to piwer?

9.4.11. Polar questions
9.4.11.1. Simple yes/no questions
Polar questions can only be distinguished from declarative clauses by the rising intonation at the end of the clause. The rising and falling intonation in question/answer
pairs is demonstrated by the lines above the examples:

kwe’ pi=per

[RP/EC-D4-5/6]
Yes/no questions can also have a negative clause as their base. Taken from a later
conversation of the same speakers of (161), there are the parallel negative examples
in (162).

[RP/EC-D4-15/16]CHAPTER 9 - CLAUSE TYPES AND UTTERANCE STRUCTURES3719.4.11.2. Polar questions with the emphatic marker
Frequently speakers use the emphatic marker -i’ on an interrogative predicate of a
yes/no question. It does not mark the clauses as questions directly, but emphasizes
the predicate and allows rising intonation on the predicate as well, as in:
(163) kowe’i’ mayok arasoe’ ewokoe-ye.
kowe’-i’

‘Do you want to go and weed for me?’[SIL-T7][LO/GP-15/7/04-146]9.4.11.3. Tag questions
There is a kind of tag question formed with a declarative clause and an added ap(o)
nka? ‘or not?’. Here the intonation could be rising in the clause and in the additional
tag or only in the tag. Examples:
(165) moeh nihirik ap nka?
moeh ni=hirik apo nka

[LO-29/8/03-22]9.4.11.4. Questions introduced by ač
The connector ač ‘and’ frequently introduces any type of clause, also questions, as
can be observed in examples (75), (85), (95) and others in this chapter. I already described how ač ‘and’ attaches to an interrogative particle amo ‘why not?’ (87), resulting in the form čam. Sometimes, when there is much emphasis on the question, the
connector can also attach to personal pronouns, where it is metathesized as well, as in
(167) and (168):
(167) nka nitorapoekow. ča piti’? – nkaw napiri’.
nka ni=tora-poe-ko-wo

The interjection hã has been mentioned in 8.4.1. It is frequently used for a positive
answer. It is not clear if it is related to the pausal form –ha–. However, hã can introduce questions that express suggestions like ‘what about …?’. It only appears in a
few clauses in my corpus, mainly when a personal pronoun follows, as in (169) and is
comparable to ča piti’ in (168). The context of the example is a story in which some
friends tell the old people to leave the village. Observe how the question only consists of hã yiti’? ‘What about you?’.

emphatic marker on predicateTable 9.1: Different types of questions in Baure and their construction9.5. Answers to questions and ellipsis
Answers to questions can be even more reduced than a predicate clause, and consist
of only one NP or an adverb or any kind of other specific information asked for.
Sometimes clausal enclitics are added to the answer for more emphasis. Polar questions are replied to with affirmative or negative particles. Some specific questions are
paired with typical answers, such as greetings.
First of all, the particles used for answering polar questions are mainly heni ‘yes’
and nka or noka ‘no’, or in a more emphatic form nokaw (NEG-COP). Furthermore, all
other negative particles can be used, such as wokow ‘not yet’. Finally, if the speaker
wants to express insecurity, there are particles like hintani ‘I don’t know’ or ‘what do
I know?’ and herik/harik or harikontoe’ ‘maybe’.
Information questions can be replied to with only an (oblique) argument. Example
(170) shows a case where the question (Q) concerned a location. The answer (A)
does not consist of anything more than a locative phrase.
(170) pitorakiyin te him čopoča’?

A: ‘There in the river, in the white one (Río Blanco).’[JC-18/9/03-21/22]A very frequent answer is given when someone asks if something has already happened, consisting generally of ver ‘already’, instead of heni ‘yes’. This also holds for
the answer to a request or imperative, as in (171):BAURE: AN ARAWAK LANGUAGE OF BOLIVIA374(171) kew pisipap! – ver!

pi=sipa-po
ver
EV-COP
2SG=wash-PRFLX
PERF
‘Go and wash (your hands)! – I already did!’[JP-20/8/03-15]The particle ver ‘already’ does not always refer to a past event, however. In combination with the clausal enclitic, -iš ‘well’, it can also refer to the near future or the present, as demonstrated in (172).
(172) ver nkačap. – veroeš.
ver
ni=kač-pa vero=iš
PERF 1SG=go-GO PERF=EXCLA
‘I will go. – Alright.’[DC-8/3/06-95]In addition, other preverbal particles or adverbs can also function as complete answers to questions. In (173) the particle moeh ‘certainly’ appears in the question and
is repeated in the answer, accompanied by the emphatic particle -kik- ‘really’. This is
generally used to reassure oneself about the truth of something that has been said
before. The only difference between question and answer in (173) is the interrogative
suffix -no in the question230.

Q: ‘Is it true?’moehkik.

‘You will find her for sure!’[RP-20/7/04-121][RP-N4-97]Examples (95) through (98) demonstrate that the particle refers to a degree of certainty. The particle moeh is probably the result of the combination of the privative
prefix mo- + a root *-ih. Due to a morphophonological change after the combination
of the two vowels o and i > oe, the particle becomes moeh. The root *-ih is unknown
to me at the present stage of research, but metathesis may also have played a role. It
could therefore be possible that the morpheme is related to quotative -hi or another
homophonous root. Also the lexeme -ihe’ ‘power’ could be related to moeh.
The particle moeh can be used as a minor clause, just like perfect ver ‘already’. It
has to be the answer to a clause that asks for ability, certainty, a favour, possibility, orCHAPTER 7 - PREVERBAL PARTICLES291permission. The answer in (89) moeh vaskopi (CERT 1PL=help=2SG) ‘we can help
you’ could also just be only the elliptic moeh ‘we can’. Compare therefore (89) to
(99):

moeh yi=asko=ni

CERT 2PL=help=1SG

‘ “Can you help me?” – “Certainly(, we can)!” ’7.8 The cohortative (imperative) particle ši
The cohortative particle ši is only used in direct speech, and the speaker is making a
strong request, suggestion or demand for a 1PL addressee that includes the speaker
him- or herself. It works like English let’s (go/do). It is by its form (CV) and it is part
of a subclass of imperative particles: ši, pa, and ta. The lexical source for this particle
is unclear. ši can also be used as a minor clause on its own without any specific verb.
When used like that, it generally means ‘let’s go’. When it is a reply, it may also be
used as an affirmative clause and stands for the verb that has been mentioned in the
context, ‘yes, let’s do that’. Here are some examples of the particle preceding main
verbs:
(100) ši vikač!
ši
vi=kač
HORT 1PL=go
‘Let’s go!’[GP-N7-70](101) aiy, ši vihinokoper!
aiy
ši
vi=hinoko-pa=ro
INTJ
HORT 1PL=see-GO=3SGm
‘Hey, let’s go and look at it!’[RP-N11-28]The reference of the cohortative particle is also marked on the main verb by the personal cross-referencing proclitic for 1PL vi-, but generally the addressee of ši is always 1PL. Only in a few cases the verb does not have a 1PL subject, but the whole
action always includes more than one participant. In the following example there are
two participants of an action, an agent (1SG, the speaker) and a patient (2SG, the addressee), but both are connected by the particle:
(102) “boen, ši namopi”, rokičowori-hi.
boen ši
ni=amo=pi
ro=kičo-wo=ri=hi
well HORT 1SG=take=2SG 3SGm=say.do-COP=3SGf=QUOT
‘ “Well, let’s go: I take (carry) you”, he said to her.’[RP-N4-66]That there have to be several participants to which ši refers in direct speech, is also
supported by clauses in which ši is used without a main verb. As mentioned above, it
generally refers to a cohortative motion meaning ‘let’s go!’ in these minor clauses.
Consider the following examples:BAURE: AN ARAWAK LANGUAGE OF BOLIVIA292(103) iherik noiy kwe’. ši noiy, ši!
iherik
noiy kwe’ ši
noiy ši
maybe
there exist HORT there HORT
‘Maybe over there are (fish). Let’s go there, let’s go!’
(104) ši noiy nisori-ye …!”
ši
noiy ni=sori-ye
HORT there 1SG=village-LOC
‘Let’s go over there to my village …!’[LO-29/8/03-45][JP-N9-13]In both examples ši is followed by the spatial adverb noiy ‘over there’, which certainly specifies the meaning of motion in space in addition, but ši could also be used
without this spatial adverb.
7.9. The intentional imperative particle pa
The particle pa closely resembles the intentional suffix -pa ‘GO’. In very few examples in my data pa functions as a free particle. It directly precedes the verb, just like
the other two imperative particles. The particle pa was only found being used with
1SG and 2SG subjects in direct speech.
The clauses in (106) are both answers to the question in (105). In an unstressed
phrase it could be nikpa ‘I will eat’ (1SG.eat-GO). In the examples below we see that
in order to put special emphasis on the statement, this verbal suffix has been separated from the verb, and now precedes it as a verbal particle.
(105)kon to nikier?

1SG=EXCLA

[RP-15/8/03-36]In the next example pa is used with a 2SG subject in the direct speech in a narration.
It co-occurs with the nominalized verb, which is the way imperative is generally
formed morphologically (cf. 9.3):
(107) kač rokičiyaw –ha–: “to pa pihirikašan nan siy-ye!”

The jussive particle ta is used only in imperative clauses, but in a different sense than
cohortative ši, which refers to 1PL, or intentional pa, which refers to 1SG or 2SG. The
particle ta is mainly used for 2nd person arguments, singular or plural, but may also
refer to 3rd person arguments; only the 1st person is excluded. The particle ta expresses a demand that occurs only in direct speech, just as the particles ši and pa. In
(108) through (110) there are examples of the jussive particle ta:
(108) ta yikač, ta pikač, ta rikač!
ta
yi=kač ta
pi=kač ta
JUSS 2PL=go

[GP-N7-80]
(110) ta rinik te riveiyan!
ta
ri=nik
te
ri=veiyan
JUSS 3SGf=eat DEM1m
3SGf=lover
‘That she may eat her lover!’[GP-N1/II-24]The marking by jussive ta is one way of marking an imperative; it is less frequent. In
general, imperative mode is marked by the nominalizing suffix -no on the verb (cf.
9.3). In example (111) the particle ta is combined with the nominalized verb:
(111) ta pinikpan!
ta
pi=nik-pa-no
JUSS 2SG=eat-GO-NOM1
‘Go and eat!’[RP-19/7/04-13]It looks as if the particle can sometimes carry person cross-reference marking; it is
indistinguishable from the marked verb -ita- ‘continue’ because of vowel assimilation. This verb may in some way be related to the jussive particle, but there is no
clear evidence. In examples (112) and (113) below the particle ta carries subject
marking:
(112) “ah, boen, nti’ nahkoša.” – “pita!” rokičowor-hi.
ah
boen nti’ ni=ahko-ša pi=ta

[RP-N3-100]
(113) moeh, pita pinik!
moeh
pi=ta
pi=nik
certainly 2SG=JUSS 2SG=eat
‘Certainly, go and eat!’[II-4/8/03-20]I think that the speakers have indeed marked the particle ta in the above examples,
because the verb ‘continue’, which would also result in the same word pita (pi=ita:BAURE: AN ARAWAK LANGUAGE OF BOLIVIA2942SG=continue) with this person marking, does not make much sense. Nonetheless,
there are so few examples that this matter remains unresolved. The most important
and striking fact is the use with 3SG and 3PL subjects. The 3rd person is excluded with
the other particles ši and pa.
7.11. The postverbal particle toeri for potential
In Baure there is a potential verb root in the two forms -toeri- and -toer(o)-, translated as ‘do how’. The root mainly occurs in compounds with the empty verb root k(i)e- ‘EV’ in questions that refer to the manner of an action ‘how’ (cf. 9.4.6), as represented in (114).
(114) pikietoerin te pinisač?
pi=kie-toeri-no
te
2SG=EV-do.how-NOM1 DEM1m
‘How do you do the fishing?’pi=inisa-čo
2SG=fish-NOM2
[LO-29/8/03-15]The root -toeri- has evolved into a postverbal particle to mark potential. When the
same root -toer(i)- occurs in the compound interrogative predicate (114), its position
is also after the main verb base. This particle is the only postverbal particle that I
have encountered in Baure. The other postverbal elements are clausal enclitics -hi
‘QUOT’, -niš ‘EXCLA’, and -enš ‘APRV’ (cf. 9.7). The postverbal particle toeri ‘potential’ frequently occurs in questions, and there it always follows the clausal enclitics. It
forms a phonological phrase with the preceding predicate194. However, as generally
the clausal enclitics are the last elements of a word, I consider the particle to be a
separate element and not another clausal enclitic. Consider the following examples to
observe the position of toeri in a clause:
(115) “karaw”, rokew-hi, “neriki nkoetoeropon-niš toeri?”

"84BAURE: AN ARAWAK LANGUAGE OF BOLIVIAPersonal enclitics are pronominal in nature (cf. 5.1.2), which means that there is either an explicit object NP or the object enclitic on the verb.
In this chapter the different types of morphological processes are presented (3.1),
followed by an overview of the parts of speech identified in Baure (3.8). In the beginning root, stem and base of a word in Baure are defined. Then free and bound
morphemes are distinguished from another, followed by specific reference to the different kinds of bound morphemes. Morphological processes include affixation (3.3),
cliticization (3.4), reduplication (3.5), compounding (3.6), and incorporation (3.7).
3.1. Roots, stems, bases and words
Example (2) is a further case of a verb with quite complex morphology:
(2)nihinoekinašapir.
ni=hino-i-ko-ino-a-ša=pi=ro
1SG=see-DUR-ABS-BEN-LK-IRR=2SG=3SGm
‘I will look for it for you.’[RP-N3-74]The verb in (2) carries three clitics that cross-refer to the following arguments in the
clause: ni- ‘1SG’ to the subject, pi-‘2SG’ to the recipient, and -ro ‘3SGm’ to the patient. The verb root -hino- ‘see’ is followed by a number of grammatical suffixes,
which manipulate the meaning. The root can be distinguished from the stem and the
base of the verb. The verb base -hinoek- ‘look for’ is the actual unit that the grammatical morphemes -ino ‘BEN’ and -ša ‘IRR’ and the personal clitics are attached to.
There are three levels distinguished in a word: root, stem, and base.96 First the
levels are defined. Payne (1997:24) defined the terms root and stem as follows: “A
root is an unanalyzable form that expresses the basic lexical content of the word. […]
A stem consists minimally of a root, but may be analyzable into a root plus derivational morphemes”. In Baure the root is the most basic lexical morpheme of a word.
The root cannot be analyzed further, but it may still be very different in meaning
from the base. The stem is the meaning unit of a word, and it constitutes the level
above the root and below the base. The base is finally the complete form that inflectional affixes and cross-referencing clitics are attached to. The base is an extension
from the stem insofar that there are certain stem suffixes attached which are not directly related to the meaning and may be replaced in certain inflections. The word is
the phonological unit that Baure speakers distinguish. It is phonologically relatively
independent, but may be further affected by processes within the phonological phrase
(cf. 2.6). The verbal word may be identical to a whole phrase or even clause. The
base may be identical with the stem and the root, but in some forms the different levels need to be distinguished. Further certain root affixes can be identified, some of
them lexical or fossilized forms. Other affixes are stem suffixes and base suffixes.
The further away from the root, the more grammatical the morphemes generally are.
96
In the tagmemic grammars of Arawak languages some of these levels were also differentiated. However,
my distinctions are different from what Allin (1975) called root, stem, word, group, and phrase in his
grammar on Resígaro. My labels do also not coincide with root, core, base, stem, and theme, differentiated
for Baure by Baptista & Wallin (1967) or Amuesha by Wise (1963). Nonetheless their analyses helped me
a lot analyzing the verb morphology and the different levels in Baure.","[105, 106]"
"CHAPTER 3 - MORPHOLOGICAL PROCESSES AND WORD CLASSES85However, some grammatical morphemes have also been fossilized as part of the
base. Some other affixes are part of the base, but get replaced when certain morphemes are attached, given that the stem is the meaning unit and not the base. The
citation form used throughout the grammar is the base.
It best to illustrate the different levels with two examples from the most complex
word classes, verbs (3) and nouns (4):
(3)word:root:
stem:
base:nihinoekovi
ni=hino-i-ko-wo=pi
1SG=look-DUR-ABS-COP=2SG
‘I am looking for you.’[MD-12/7/04-102]*-hino- ‘see’
*-hinoe- ‘look for’
-hinoek- ‘look for’The absolute suffix -ko is part of the verb base, but is sometimes replaced, e.g. when
the suffix -wana ‘DEP’ is attached. The root -hino- occurs in the base -hinok- ‘see,
look’. The verb base -hinoek- ‘look for’ contains the stem -hinoe- [hino + i].
(4)word:root I:
root II:
stem:
base:viyakison
vi=yaki-so-no
1PL=fire-CLF:stick-POSS
‘our firewood’
yaki
-soyakis
-yakison[LO-29/8/03-80]‘fire’
‘classifier: stick’
‘firewood’
‘firewood (possessed)’In (4) there are two roots in a compound. One is a classifier root -so ‘CLF:stick’, the
other one a free nominal root yaki ‘fire’. The derived form yakis ‘firewood’ is also a
free nominal base, which cannot be possessed. The possessive morpheme -no derives
the bound base -yakison ‘firewood’, which needs to be marked by a possessor proclitic.
A noun can function as an argument in the clause, but also as a predicate. When
used predicatively, the non-verbal base is the unit verbal morphemes are attached to
(cf. 5). This is shown in (5) and (6):
(5)(6)riširanowor
ri=šir-a-no-wo=ro
3SGf=son-LK-POSS-COP=3SGm
‘It is her (the duck’s) brood.’
riširanonev
ri=šir-a-no-nev
3SGf=son-LK-POSS-PL
‘her brood (eggs)’[LO/GP-18/7/04-22][RP-19/7/04-28]BAURE: AN ARAWAK LANGUAGE OF BOLIVIA86Sometimes a root may also be a grammatical morpheme. One example is the copula
predicate, which behaves like non-verbal predicates. It is simply based on the attributive prefix ko-, as in (7):
(7)kowapa teč rotir howoki.
ko-wapa teč
rotir
howoki
ATTR-COS DEM2m
3SGmP hole
‘There is a hole in it (lit. there is its hole).’[HC-L13/9/03-22]Even though generally the word stem carries the meaning, there are many examples
where this is not so. In particular non-verbal bases are much more influenced by the
verbal morphemes than might be expected. A very frequently used non-verbal base is
the adverb or perfect preverbal particle ver ‘already, PERF’. This adverb can be combined with directional verbal suffixes like -pa ‘GO’ and -pik ‘COME’. Example (8)
shows how much the interpretation actually comes from the morphemes added rather
than from the base:
(8)verapikier nakoš teč vir.
ver-a-pik=ro
nakoš
PERF-LK-COME=3SGm from.there
‘The wind came from there.’teč
DEM2mvir
wind
[DC-10/4/06-86]Lexical roots are mainly disyllabic or trisyllabic, whereas affixes and clitics are predominantly monosyllabic. Those lexical roots that are predominantly monosyllabic
are grammatical classifiers and bound adjectives.
3.2. Free and bound morphemes
In Baure there are more bound than free morphemes. Free morphemes are nouns,
adjectives, adverbs, clause connectors, determiners, pronouns and particles. Bound
morphemes are all verbs, bound nouns (obligatorily possessed), classifiers, and rightbound adjectives (cf. 4.9.1). All affixes and clitics are bound morphemes, but most of
them are not exclusively bound to one word class. In general clitics can be distinguished from affixes because they are placed on the outside (Halpern 1998:106), as
in Figure 3.1:
––root––affixation
cliticization
Figure 3.1: The layering around a word in BaureThe specific kinds of cliticization are discussed in 3.4.
Bounded elements are represented by hyphens, e.g. -piri ‘sibling’ is a left-bound possessed noun; čo- is a right-bound adjectival root; ko- ‘ATTR’ is differentiated as a
prefix from the suffix -ko ‘ABS’ and from the free interrogative particle ko ‘why’.
Clitics are represented by a = sign in the glosses, e.g. ro= ‘3SGm’ and ni= ‘1SG’.","[106, 107, 108]"

‘Why don’t you, papa, want me to accompany you?’
[LO-29/8/03-26]In one example (80) the construction remains the same with the non-verbal predicate,
and the subject -pi ‘2SG’ is encliticized to the interrogative particle. This is not surprising, as non-verbal predicates actually mark subjects by enclitics, which occur in
the slot where objects, when marked, occur on the verb (cf. 5). Therefore the subject
should be expected to behave like the object does (in Figure 9.3 we see that transitive
verbs mark the object on the particle). Nevertheless the example has to be handled
with care. The other example (81) shows a different possibility represented in the
data: the perfective/reflexive suffix -po ‘PRFLX’ occurs in the person slot on the particle ko ‘why?’, whereas the non-verbal privative predicate moki’inan ‘not want’ does
not have any person marking, but a following personal pronoun refers to the subject
explicitly.
It is also possible to construct a ko-question with a kind of relative clause (cf.
10.2). In the following example (82) an adverb follows the particle, and the adverb is
specified by a relative clause introduced by the indefinite pronoun to ka. The verb in
the relative clause is semantically the main verb of the sentence; syntactically it is the
head of the relative clause.

[DC-10/4/06-34]Incidently, the clarification question ‘What?’ can be formed by the single particle ka,
which is formally identical to the indefinite pronoun, but also strikingly similar to the
particle ko or attributive ko-222. Still, as the relations to those morphemes remains
unclear, I will simply gloss this as an interjection.
(83)ka?
INTJ‘What?’[IS-12/4/03-26]Finally, it is also possible to construct a negative ko-question, even though this only
occurs in a restricted context. The negative particle follows the marked particle and
precedes the verb, just like adverbs or preverbal particles. But this question can only
be interpreted as a kind of suggestion of the kind ‘why don’t you …?’, as demonstrated in (84):
222In the neighbouring Moxo languages the attributive prefix has the form ka-.","[374, 375]"
