Case
Barasano is a nominative-accusative language. The subject in Barasano
bears no case marking whereas the object is generally marked when it is
definite. Regarding word order, the subject is sentence initial when first
introduced or in special focus and is sentence final elsewhere.
Barasano has four morphemes which mark case though not obligatorily:
-re occurs on noun phrases in the roles of object, experiencer, benefactee,
and manner; réka occurs on noun phrases of accompaniment andinstrument, -h# marks locations or times; and ya marks the genitive (see
§4.8).§.1-5.3 -reTheending-re is usedto marktheobject,theexperiencer,andbenefactee. It is also used to mark manner, which is discussed in §11.9.","[82, 83]"
"4.7-4.8 Noun-noun stractures
Barasano forms noun-noun structures by compounding and by use of the
case marker ya (genitive). Because of the classifier system and few independent
nouns, Barasano does not have many noun-noun structures.",[78]

"Predicatenominative,locative,existential,andpossessive clauses often share the same constituents in many languages.
This is true in Barasano, where all of these sentence types share the sameverb, yd ‘to be’ and its negative counterpart ba/badi ‘to not be’. The
possessive construction may also occur with the verb kzti/ku#to ‘to have’.
Predicate nominative. The following illustrate the predicate nominative
with the verb yd ‘to be’:110Barasano Syntax(334) gaw-a

That is Jim’s book.ya-a-hasibe-PRES--33inLocative. Locatives may be formed with yd ‘to be’, as in (336), or with
several stative verbs which refer more specifically to the location of an
entity, e.g., hesa ‘to be on top of and saya ‘to be inside’.

3inExistential. Existentials are formed with ya ‘to be’ and ba/badi ‘to not
be’. See (337) and (339). The participants of a discourse are usually first
introduced as existing. For example, (338) introduces Sue’s mother at the
beginning of a narrative.

Possessive. The possessive clause may be formed with ya ‘to be’ or
ba/badi ‘to not be’. In these cases, the possessor is encoded as an object.
For example, in (340) and (341), yw (1s) is encoded as an object.

Thepossessiveclausemayalsobeformedwith ke/kutior kvo,bothmeaning ‘to have’; ku/kzti is generally used when the possessed is perceived
as an inherent characteristic of the possessor, e.g., ‘A head has hair’, or ‘Thave the name John’ as in (342).

1shai ‘to be big’ is often used in possessive clauses. In such cases, hai is
generally nominalized with animate nominalizers which refer to the
possessor. In (343) hai-gu ‘one who has a lot of is the possessor and we-ri
‘dirt’ is the possessed:
(343) ie-ri

7.5, Juxtaposition. Juxtaposition is defined as the ordering of phrases
or clauses where there is no marking to show their relationship
grammatically. There are at least two types of juxtaposition, that of verb
phrases and that of noun phrases.
Juxtaposition of verb phrases is used to indicate a series of events in
sequence all performed by the same subject. These verb phrases may
consist of optional objects and may contain compound verbs © but there
is no subject and no tense or person marking on the verbs. Illustration
(344) has these juxtaposed verb phrases bracketed.","[127, 128, 129]"

inaseriesofstudiesofColombian languages produced by SIL members under the
tutelage of Dr. David Weber at a workshop held for that purpose
in the fall of 1984. The series is edited by Dr. Paul Frank, who
also authored the first volume of the series—Ika Syntax.
These sketches are based on a typological, functionalperspective which provides an excellent framework for writing
broadly useful, descriptive grammars. Linguists and nonlinguists
alike can derive a helpful understanding of what these languages
are like without the heavy demands of a rigorously theoretical
orientation.
Barasana is a member of the eastern Tucanoan language family
and is closely related to Taiwano. However, the Barasana and
Taiwana people are of different ancestry and thus form two
distinct social groups. These peoples live in southeastern
Colombia just above the equator along the Piraparand River and,
at the present time, number about 250 speakers.
Wendell Jones and Paula Jones have worked with the Barasana
andTaiwanasinceMarchof 1977undertheauspicesof theSummer Institute of Linguistics and the ministry of Government
of Colombia. They concentrated on studying three closely related
dialects, collecting the data which is the basis for the analysis
found in this volume.

"NounPhrase614.7, Compound nouns. Compound nouns are rare, undoubtedly due to
the productiveness of combining a noun and classifier to form a referring
expression. In the few that occur, the first noun attributes characteristics
or properties and the second provides the reference. For example, wai-sotu
‘fish pot’ (pot refers to the method of cooking), bode-kiibua (dragonfly
canoe) ‘helicopter’ and hea-guso (fire alligator) ‘cayman’.
4.8. Genitive constructions. Barasano uses the case marker ya (genitive)
to express ownership. It is generally used in referring expressions, and occurs
between the possessor and the possessed, e.g., Hdibe ya-wi (Jim GEN-house)
‘Jim’s house.’ The possessor is usually a pronoun, e.g., 7 ya-wi (3ms GEN-house)
‘his house’ or so ya-papera-tuti (3fs GEN-paper-stack) ‘her book’. The possessor
precedes the possessed unless the possessed is topicalized in which case it is
fronted. In illustration (163), ya (genitive) follows the head which is topicalized.
(163) hie
hammockiya-gu3ms GEN-hammockhis long hammock
There is a plural genitive form ye, e.g., bas-a ye sita (human-p GENp land)
‘the people’s land’. With plural inanimate referents (as well as for
nonindividuated items), ye (genitive plural) occurs without a classifiersuffix, e.g., ida ye ‘their things’.!8
Notions like part-whole and kinship relationship are expressed by putting
the possessor directly before the possessed. To indicate the possession of
body parts, a noun or pronoun is directly followed by the term for the
body part, e.g., Haibe abo ‘Jim’s hand’ or i 4bo ‘his hand’. The form -wi
‘house’ !9 may also occur without the genitive marker, e.g., Haibe wi ‘Tim’s
house’. Kinship terms are obligatorily preceded by a noun or pronoun
which refers to the person so related and which directly precedes the
kinship term, e.g., Haibe yike ‘Jim’s grandfather’, or i yikw ‘his grandfather’.","[78, 79]"
"NounPhrase59DIM) is viewing ‘few’ as a mass, whereas siguri perceives the individuals that
constitute ‘the few.
In cases where quantifiers modify nouns they generally occur before the
noun as in (157) where hdraé ‘many’ precedes basa ‘people’ and (158)
where hairo ‘many’ precedes gahetidi (J) ‘possessions’:!7
(157) héré

He gets a lot of things.
When a quantifier occurs with a noun which is new information or is in
some type of special focus, it follows the noun.
Quantifiers may also occur alone with suffixes that refer to an implicit
(or previously mentioned) head.
4.6. Numerals. Numerals occur with suffixes which generally refer to an
implicit head. When they occur with the head noun, they may precede or
follow it. When they follow it, we contend that the head noun is
topicalized or in some type of special focus. Thus comparing illustration
(159) with (160), (160) is considered a noun phrase where the head is in
focus.(159) hua-rahe— kGbe-rahe-ritwo-cylinder metal-cylinder-p

example, the classifier -r#bu ‘day’ functions as a noun yet does not occur
by itself, e.g., idia-raébu ‘three days’ in (161).""pahetidi (J) / gaheyetidi (E)60Barasano Syntax(161) idia-réibe ya-yu-hu

With animate nouns, numerals agree in number and gender. A list of
numerals for animate nouns is given in (162). The gender suffixes -x
(masculine), and -o (feminine) follow all the numbers except hxa ‘two’ and
idia ‘three’ which are the only numbers marked with -r4 (plural). If a group
is mixed according to gender, the -# (masculine) suffix is used. Numberagreement marking with numerals is strictly adhered to for animate nouns,
e.g., hua-rd (two-anp) ‘two living things’.

‘five-(m/f’
—‘five-(mf’With inanimate nouns numerals agree in class and number. For example,
the number Awa ‘two’ followed by the class marker -hdi ‘flat, thin objects’
produces the hxahdi ‘two flat, thin objects’, which may modify any object
in the -hdi class, e.g., hua-hai sudi-hai (two-flat“thin cloth-flat“thin) ‘two
pieces of cloth’.
The number ‘one’ has a different form when referring to inanimate
nouns. The inanimate form is koho-, e.g., koho-raibu ‘one day’.
By contrast to animate nouns, for which number agreement is rigidly
adheredto, with inanimatenounsthere is a certain amountof variation:hua ‘two’ is rarely marked as plural, idia ‘three’ is optionally marked as
plural, and numbers above four are usually marked as plural. For example,
‘two days’ is huwa-rébu (two-day); ‘three days’ may be idia-réibu (three-day)
or idia-réibu-ri (three-day-p); and ‘four days’ is babari-rébu-ri (four-day-p).","[76, 77, 78]"
"BAn exception to this is in the case of subordinate clauses which link with preceding
sentences or are used in switching topics. In such cases -ri (participle) most frequently occurs
with bahi ‘to be’ and seems to refer to the situation in general (event or state-oriented
rather than subject-oriented).
°The verb sure ‘to cut off many’ in (429) is a verb which agrees in number with its
object.",[156]
"Parts of Speech35
2,.17-2,.21 Nounadjuncts2.17, Case markers. The noun adjunct most commonly used is -re
(object) which marks objects of verbs or any nonsubject word which is
thematic, ie., of primary importance in the ongoing discourse. Generally
these objects are highly individuated. For example, all pronouns which
occur as objects take -re (object). In the case of nominalized clauses where
the verb is transitive, the object marker is crucial to the meaning. Compare
the genitive construction of (106) with the object in (107):
(106) 7
bue-g
3ms_study-ms
his student(107) i-rebue-gu3ms-Ostudy-msone who teaches himWhen the object is not thematic, it need not occur with -re (object) even
though it may be highly individuated. For example, in (108) kakw ‘dad’ is
only mentioned and does not become a real part of the story till later.
Thus the speaker did not mark kaku ‘dad’ as the object of ia ‘to see’.(108) ti-ribu-re— wadi-ka-huthat-day-ocome-far*pst--3kak-utia-gumy parent-mssee-msyeado-hudobigo_ya-ro1shere-placedomingobe-NoMOn that day I came here, a Sunday, in order to see dad.
Later in the account, kake ‘dad’ is introduced as a real part of the story,
in that he responds to the main participant’s speech, becoming an active
participant. Thus, -re (object) now occurs with kakz.(109) “to

(spacer), -hwa (selective focus), ridé (restricting focus), -b4 (contrastive
focus) and ya (J) / yuha (£) (temporal pointer). The clitic -dé (spacer) is
used to separate sentences or groups of sentences into two parts of
unequal importance. The order of the constituents may be from less
important (anaphoric information) to more important (nonanaphoric
information) or vice versa. In (110) -dé ‘spacer’ separates the anaphoric
information ‘got her pregnant at night’, and example (111) illustrates the
use of -hxa (selective focus) when switching from one main participant to
another,

2.19. Quantifiers. Quantifiers are inflected for animacy, e.g., ha-ra
(many-anp) ‘many (animate)’ and hai-ro (many-NoM) ‘much (inanimate)’.
The Barasana count by fingers and toes, and eventually by people. They
normally count up to five and beyond that would use ‘many’. The word for
‘five’ is koho-b6-k6-ro (one-hand-count-Nom), and ‘twenty’ is sig-u bas-uké-ro (one”an-ms human-ms count-NoM).
2.20. Classifiers. Approximately 140 classifiers have been recorded in
Barasano. Most of these are semantically based on shape. They are usually
nominal suffixes which cannot occur alone. Some classifiers are highly
referential in that nominals require them. For example, -# is the classifier
for trees or wood in ktibu-u ‘tree called kibuw’; -u (classifier for tree) is
replaced by a classifier for hollow objects in kibu-a ‘canoe’. However, kibuParts of Speech37by itself may refer to the nonspecific form for ‘canoes’ or ‘benches’ (whose
singular form is kfibu-ro).!° See §4.1 for a complete list of these classifiers.
2.21. Spatial relators. Spacialrelators of Barasanoare postpositions.","[52, 53, 54, 55]"
"62Barasano SyntaxThe genitive ya occurs with a suffix to indicate the possessed. For animate
possessed elements, a gender-number suffix is used: -# (masculine), -o
(feminine), and -r4 (plural). The /a/ in ya (genitive) is dropped when followed
by -# (masculine singular) and -o (feminine singular). For inanimate possessed
elements, a classifier suffix is used. The possessor is generally a personal
pronoun. The phrases so formed, like the following, refer back to some
previously-mentioned animate, possessed beings:”(164)—y-w

hammock’,Noun Phrase63(170) ba = ya-hai2sGEN-flat“thinyour flat, thin thing (e.g., machete)
4.9. Descriptive modifiers. Barasano is a verb-adjective language, which
is to say that there is a single set of roots which may take either regular
verbal inflection and serve as predicates, or may take nominalizers,
participials, and classifiers, and serve as modifiers in noun phrases. A
descriptive noun phrase is formed by a stative verb, (e.g., bai ‘be bad, ugly’,
boti ‘be white’, yoa ‘be long’, hai ‘be big, many, kéda ‘be good’, etc.’)
followed by either:
1. A gender-number marker or nominalizer, e.g., kéda-go (be*good-ts)
‘good woman’ and kéda-se (be“good-Nom) ‘good stuff; or
2. A participle and a classifier or, for humans,the word bés- ‘human’plus gender-number marker, e.g., keda-ri-bedo (be good-prcrt-ring)
‘a nice ring’ and sia-ri bas-w (kill-prcepL human-ms) ‘a man who kills’.
A head noun is not required, as in (171), where both modifiers are used
as referring expressions to the implicit head noun sudi-hdi (cloth-flat*thin)
‘cloth’.

4,10. Postpositional phrases. Postpositions occur following noun phrases.
They head the noun phrase and bear the phrase’s case markers. The following
are examples of postpositional phrases with the postpostions hoe ‘on top of
and gudareko ‘middle’.

"Causativized verbs showing the resultant state frequently follow other
uninflected verbs, which indicate the means employed to cause the
resultant state of the object. For example, in (311), the subject pounds
down the toucan he cut up with the result that it becomes soft (in this
case, edible). And in (312), in order to cause another person to enter a
house, s6 ‘to cause to enter’ is preceded by the means used to make the
person enter, i.e., by calling.

Such verb phrases also occur with ia ‘to see’ and eka ‘to feed’. When the
participant’s gaze is perceived as changing location, it may simply be a
change in direction such as ia two (see return“caus) ‘to look back’; or achange in the goal as with ia hd (see enter*room*caus) ‘to look into a
room’.45 The verb eka, with a causative suffix, may be preceded by various
other verb roots to signify ‘to cause to receive’. In such cases, the subject
commits an implicit action which causes him to receive the action stated by
the verbal complement and committed by the nominal preceding it as in
(313).

6.9. Motion. Motion verbs may occur with the regular tenses and
generally imply motion away. However when the speaker has a specific
point of reference in mind, -a (motion) occurs, followed by -di ‘toward

9.4. Quantifier negation. Inherently negative quantifiers do not exist in
Barasano. Instead, a deverbal noun phrase is negated by ba ‘to not be’
showing its nonexistence. For example, (406) means ‘No one will help me’
(more literally: “The one who will help me, he is not’).

Parts of Speech
This chapter briefly discusses the major grammatical categories of
Barasano, beginning with the open classes of nouns, verbs, modifiers in
noun phrases, and adverbs; and ending with the closed classes of
pronouns, other proforms, noun adjuncts, verb adjuncts, conjunctions,
interjections, and negators.
2.1, Nouns. Nouns in Barasano fill the roles of subject, object, benefactive,
location, time, manner, and instrument. They are divided into eight classes with
the most basic division being animate vs. inanimate. Animate nouns are
subdivided depending on their inflection for gender and number. These classes
are reflected in verb agreement with the class of the subject.
Class 1 nouns are inanimate nouns and may end in any vowel; a few
examples are hidobu ‘cassava squeezer’, ktibua ‘canoe’, ruhabedo ‘ring’, andwii ‘house’. Inanimate nouns are inflected for class and number. Classifiers
generally describe the shape of the object. For example, -h4j ‘flat, thin
object’ is a classifier which joins with kébe ‘metal’ to form the inanimate
noun kébe-hdi ‘machete’, and which may be pluralized with the suffix -ri,e.g., kdbe-hai-ri ‘machetes’.
Class 2 nouns are animate nouns which are unspecified as to their
gender and number; these must be inflected with gender-number suffixes.
For example, hak- ‘parent’, when inflected with -# (masculine singular)
becomes hak- ‘father’, when inflected with -o (feminine singular) becomes
hak-o ‘mother’, and when inflected with -wa (plural) becomes hak-ua
‘parents’. Other examples of this class are gaw-x/-o/-a ‘male, female, plural19Barasano Syntax20nonindigenous people’ and bed-i/-eo «), -e (£)/-erd ‘younger male, female,
plural sibling’. Domesticated cats and chickens also belong to this class.
Class three consists of nouns which are only plural. There are only two
words in this class, bésa (animate group) and ria ‘children’, e.g., 7 bésa ‘he
and those with him’. Neither of these two nouns occurs in the singular. To
refer to a child, one switches to bak-#/-o (progeny-ms/s) ‘son or daughter’.
Class four consists of nouns which refer to animates which do not have
any gender marking. The nouns of this class are mostly animals. In the
singular,theytriggermasculine,thirdperson,verbinflection,unless-o(feminine singular) is added to the word, or the word rdbio ‘female’ is
added to modify the noun causing it to refer to a female. Examples are
wekw ‘tapir’, weko ‘parrot’, habo ‘armadillo’, yai ‘wild cat/dog’, and yese
‘pig’. In order to speak of a female pig, one may say yese-o ‘female pig’.
Class five consists of nouns which are only masculine. This class has
nouns referring to kinship relationships and religious offices which are held
only by men. Examples are biaga ‘shaman who protects those performing
initiation rites’, hakoarébe‘father-in-law’, and baya‘dance leader’.","[35, 36, 37, 38]"
"Class six is comprised of nouns which are only feminine. These refer to
kinship relations. Examples are békaho ‘aunt’, dsibo ‘husband’s sister’ and
hého ‘son’s wife’. (Note that these all end in -o.)
Class seven consists of only one word, siika ‘baby’. It is not inflected for
genderbut maybe referredto throughthe verbas either masculineorfeminine depending on the sex of the child.
Class eight refers to speech act participants. This class consists of the
pronouns y# (is), y#a (1x), badi (1i), ba (2s), and bia (2p). Kinship terms may
also be used when referring to the second person along with one of the
above pronouns. When one of these pronouns occurs as subject, the verb
takes the nonthird-person-animate marking, except in certain tenses (see
§6.1).
Nouns may be pluralized in various ways. The prototypical marker for
animate nouns is -a (plural, animate) which serves to signal animacy in
nouns which have no gender marking in the singular, e.g., ydko ‘star
(animate, assumed masculine)’ becomes ydko-a ‘stars’.
Nouns which refer to collections are inherently plural and require a
singularizing suffix to refer to a single member. For example, the animate
noun ia ‘caterpillars’ refers to a collection of caterpillars. In order to refer
to a single caterpillar one says ia-b# (caterpillars-s) ‘caterpillar’, The
inanimate noun oho ‘bananas’ occurs with -ro ‘singularizer’ to refer to asingle banana, i.e., oho-ro ‘banana’.
The pluralizer for nearly all inanimate nouns is; -ri (plural, inanimate),
€.g., sott-ri ‘pots’. Besides a plural form, many inanimate nouns have aParts of Speech21form to refer to general, nonspecific objects (usually the simplest form).
For example, kibua ‘canoe’ has the plural form kdbuari ‘canoes’ and the
general, nonspecific form kébu ‘canoes’. In a context where the speaker
alludes to a group travelling by canoes without focusing on the number ofcanoes, he may employ the nonspecific form.
In addition to nouns as described above, the language relies heavily on
deverbalnouns, whichare also subdividedinto two groups, animateandinanimate.
Animate deverbal nouns are formed by adding a gender-number suffix to a
verb, e.g., bda-go (work-ts) ‘female worker’; or by adding -ri (participle) to the
verb plus b&s-#/-o/-a (human-n/-/-p) to form agentive nominalizations, e.g.,
béa-ri bas-o (work-prceL human-fs) ‘working woman’,
Inanimate deverbal nouns require a participial following the verb root, e.g.,
we-ri-ka (fly-prcpL-hollow) ‘airplane’; or they may be formed by adding general
nominalizers, e.g., wit-se (fly-Nom) ‘flying things (airplanesy’.”","[38, 39]"

2.9. Modifiers in noun phrases. Barasano is a verb-adjective language.
The verbal equivalent of a modifying adjective is a predicate verb in a
nonrelative construction. That is, a single set of roots may take either
regular verbal inflection and serve as predicates, or may take nominalizers,
participials, and classifiers and serve as modifiers in noun phrases.
Compare (84), in which buti ‘to be hard’ serves as a modifier with (85), in
which it serves as a predicate.

the grammars. Obviously, a terrific amount of work has been done since

have seen the light of day.

of the One who gave language to Man and of the speakers who—in using
language—continually shape it to serve their purposes in their

Introduction
Barasano and Taiwano! are closely related languages of the Eastern
Tucanoan family. The Taiwana people are of different ancestry than the
Barasana, and thus a distinct social group. It is upon this basis that the two
groups may intermarry.
These peoples live in southeastern Colombia just above the equator
along the Piraparana river at approximately six to seven hundred feet
above sea level. The rivers are, for the most part, not navigable and thusit has been one of the more isolated areas of the department of the
Vaupés.
Barasano and Taiwano are now spoken by about 250 people. These two
groups were once much more numerous. Today there remain five distinct
subgroups among the Barasana and at least four among the Taiwana. The
people disagree as to the naming of their various groups, making an
organized listing virtually impossible (Hugh-Jones 1979:282-85). This
confusion may be the result of their not wanting others to know too much
about their own group. Hence, in many cases the names given a group
have been given by other groups rather than by members of the group
itself. Also some names that have survived began as the way one group
disparagingly referred to another.
1We use the Spanish names Barasano and Taiwano when referring to el idioma barasano
‘the Barasano language’ and e/ idioma taiwano ‘the Taiwano language’, When referring to
the people themselves, we use Barasanaand Taiwana, thinking of la gente barasanaBarasana people’ and /a gente taiwana ‘the Taiwana people’. .‘lheBarasano Syntax2The authors have worked with the Barasana and Taiwana (both in and
out of their homeland) since March of 1977 under the auspices of the
Summer Institute of Linguistics and the Ministry of Government of
Colombia. We benefitted from prior work by Richard and Connie Smith
(see references for Smith). We have worked extensively with individuals of
the following four dialects (as the individual identifies his or her dialect).
Among the Barasana: Hilda Marin Leén and Roberto Marin N. of the
Yeba Masa; Jaime Reina G. of the Janeraé (Céme Masa) (1); Antonio and
Enrique Lagorio (Queti Masa) and Emilio (Uma Nara) of the Janera.
Among the Taiwana, Alejandro Motero of the Eduria has been very
helpful.
The major difference between Janera (Barasano) and Eduria (Taiwano)
is the position of pitch-stress on words. Come Masa, Queti Masa and Uma
Nara refer to themselves as Janera when relating to outsiders. Since Céme
Masa has some common dialectical differences in the choice of words fromthe other two dialects, we use the Céme Masa (ancestral name) and Uma
Nara (joking name) to distinguish them. We have concentrated our efforts
on studying these three dialects of Barasano and this grammar sketch is of
those dialects. However,of the differences

Although I saw you picking up (something), I didn’t see what you
picked up.
-re is used for the tenses of past conjecture and reportative signifying
that the speaker did not witness the event. The referent of these
nominalizations is nonsubject. For example, if -re were used in illustration
(469), yi-se-re would become yi-re-re and the translation would be:
‘Although she heard about what he had said...’ indicating that she got her
information regarding what he said secondhand.
-ti is usedfor the remainingtenses,far past andfuture, illustratedin(471) and (472) respectively.(471) i-reyuisi-boa-ka-ti-re3ms-O 1s give-BUT-far“PST-NOM-PROX-O

Classifiers are added to the nominalizers for nonspecific items to make
them refer to single inanimate items. Following are examples of the
classifier -b used with the various tenses—present, past conjecture tense
(speaker did not see him weave the basket), far-past witnessed tense
(speaker saw him weave the basket), and future.

trees, torsos, hammocks, nets and mountains), and -a (classifier for hollow
objects, objects with holes, spherical objects and appendages) are preceded
by -k in the present tense. For example, compare (477) with (478) and

11.7, Nominalizations in apposition. There seem to be no relative
clauses in Barasano just as there are no relative pronouns. What might
normally appear to be a relative clause is analyzed as a nominalized clause
in apposition to a noun, pronoun, proper name, or noun phrase in a
subject position. Or the nominalized clause may occur in apposition to an
object as a kind of modifier, or with a free noun form used as a classifier.
In each case, the nominalization alone can carry the meaning which is
understood with or without the noun or phrase to which it refers.
Examples of this phenomena follow.
Illustration (480) appears to have a relative clause following the head
noun Aix ‘hammock’. The problem with such an analysis is that the clause
661 (478), -ria + -# becomes -rii. The dropping of the consonant also occurs for
nominalizer -g# (masculine singular). Thus béha-ria-n can refer to ‘one who ascended
vertically’. To a few speakers -ria + -u becomes -riz. Also, in (479), -fi + -4# becomes -tii.","[165, 166, 167]"
"94Barasano SyntaxAs has been said, -kod goes beyond the scope of completive aspect to
express fulfillment of an expectation. The fulfillment may be the
expectation or the opposite of the expectation, depending on the context.
The opposite of the expectation is determined pragmatically and not
marked.‘
Illustration (276) is an often used expression for when a member of the
household returns from having gone to do some known activity. Here the
expectation was that the member would return and -ko& marks the
fulfillment of that.

be-FF-Q

Have you been? (You've done it, huh?)
Look at (278), a similar expression, and then contrast it with (279).
Sentence (278) is only used immediately after a person has bathed; (279)
is used at any time speaking of an earlier incident that day. In (279), the
speaker is simply asking the question if the hearer has bathed, while in
(278) the speaker presupposes that the hearer was bathing (having seen
him bathing, or ascending from the water hole, or having been told by the
hearer that he was going to bathe).

In (280) -koa (fulfillment) occurs with the durative construction (verb
plus yd ‘to be’) in order to indicate the fulfillment of an expectation. In
this case, the reality is the opposite of the expectation implied by the use
of the concessionary clause, viz., that ‘I’ will no longer care for the house,40in related languages, this type of contraexpectation is expressed as a distinct morpheme.
In Macuna the morphemes are -k4, which has been glossed ‘emphatic’ and -k6, which has
been glossed “completive’.","[111, 112]"

béka-bo ‘ant hill4.4, The nominal ruha. The semantically empty noun ruha is used with
classifiers to refer to an object without naming the object itself. The
classifier, then, supplies the referential properties of the resulting noun,
e.g., tuha-a ‘hollowed-out object, object with hole’. In the case where two
features are known, a suffix indicating design would follow the nominal
ruha and that suffix would then bear the classifier, e.g., ruha-piru-ro
(Q-striped-cL) ‘striped thing’ which could be used when referring to a
striped towel.
4.5. Quantifiers. Quantifiers may occur with or without a noun head
and are inflected for animacy. The marker for animate is -ra as in ha-ra
(be*many-anp) ‘many’, and for inanimate is -ro as in hai-ro (big-Nom) ‘much,
many’.!6 Exceptionally, siguri ‘few, some’ has what is generally an inanimate
pluralizer -ri following sig-# (one*an-ms) ‘one animate male’.
In the list of quantifiers in (156), note that several end with -aka,
(diminutive), and -k6é ‘to count’. The form -ka is perhaps -k6 where the 6
has become 4 when preceding raka ‘with’. (There is some idiolectal
variation in the use of quantifiers.)

"146Barasano Syntax11.6. Time-bound nominalizations. Nominalizations which are bound
to a specific time are formed from verbs (unmarked for gender-number)
by suffixing a tense-evidential suffix, a nominalizer, and in some cases a
classifier. The tense-evidential markers are listed in (463).
(463) AnimateInanimate-r#a (INTENT)-ri._-ka (far“pst)-ka-ti (far*pst-NoOM~PROX)(PRES/PST)-rla (CONJ’PST)-ria (CONJ‘PST)-ro (FUT)-ro-ti (FUT-NOM~PROX)There are two things to take note of here:
(a) For the animates, the absence of marking indicates present and
immediate past tense, except in the case of agentive nominalizations where
-ri (participle) is used before the generic noun, bas- ‘human’. This
construction is discussed under nominalizations which are not time-bound,along with other nominalizations which refer to present tense.
(b) When a nominalization with -ti (nonproximate nominalizer)
(inanimate for nonindividuated items, actions or abstractions) refers to
someindividuatedobject,aclassifierfollows,andhastheeffectofsignaling that the referent is more highly individuated. (It serves the same
function as -ri (participle) which is discussed in the previous section.) For
example, compare (464) with (465).

weave-farPST--PROXNOMthings he wove
(465) i = sua-ka-ti-bu
3ms weave-far“PpsT-NOM-PROX-basket
the basket (I saw) him weave or his woven basket
The nominalizers for animates which follow the tenses listed in (463) are
derived from the set listed in (122) by choosing the consonants -g, -k, 7, or
d and suffixing the appropriate gender-number markers -# (masculine), -a
(feminine), and -4 (plural). (The exception to the above is that the
nominalizers for past conjecture and intention have no consonants.)
Examples (466)-(468) illustrate the use of these nominalizers as they
refer to nonindividuated or nonspecific items: (466) shows the nominalizer
-ku referring to the subject of the verb sia ‘to kill’, and the object f-re ‘him’
preceding the nominalization; (467) demonstrates the nominalizer -kxSubordination147referring to the object of the verb sia ‘to kill’, andthe subject 7 ‘he’preceding the nominalization, and in (468) the nominalizer -go refers to
the subject of the intransitive verb eha ‘arrive’.(466) i-re — sia-ka-ku

(467)— sia-ro-ku
3ms__kill-FuT--PROXmsthe one whomhe will kill(468) ado

here — arrive-fs
one (female) who just arrived
The nominalizers for inanimates, are -se, -re and -ro which are suffixedto verb roots to refer to a particular event, and -ti which is used for past
and future tense. As a time-bound nominalizer, -se indicates the present
tense for nonindividuated items or actions. In (469), -se indicates that she
heard what he said when he said it.

Although she heard what he said, she didn’t respond.
-ro is also used for the present tense but in contrast to -se (often used
for actions), -ro is used for a quantity, place, time, or a general/nonspecific
thing. Note (470), where -se (nominalizer) refers to the action of picking
up and -ro (nominalizer) refers to the object that was being picked up
(which could be anything). For more on -ro, see §11.8.","[163, 164, 165]"
"Parts of Speech312.11. Personal pronouns. A personal pronoun is very often a noun phrase
in the subject position and is used in the noun phrase to enhance definiteness.
Personalpronounsdistinguishfirst, second,andthird person,andsingularversus plural. They also distinguish between first person plural inclusive and
exclusive. In the third person singular there is an animate/inanimate distinction
as well as separate forms for masculine and feminine. All of these pronouns are

"Foreword
Colombia, land of E] Dorado, land of gold and emeralds! But even moreprecious are the gems found—not beneath its soil—but within its
indigenous languages. Among these gems I would count the auxiliary verb
system of Kogi, the positional verbs of Ika, the compound verbs of Epena,
the evidential systems of Tucanoan languages, as well as their noun
classifier systems.
For ten weeks in the fall of 1984, it was my privilege to lead a workshop,
guiding several si. colleagues in writing grammar sketches from a
typological and functional perspective. What began as mere ‘sketches’ have
become valuable grammars, and now with the publication of the second of
these, we must acknowledge the authors’ success.
The following impress me as the most significant reasons why this project
yielded such rich fruit:
1. The typological/functional perspective provided an excellent
frameworkfor writing—aswasourintention—broad,useful,descriptivegrammars. Linguists and nonlinguists alike should be able to derive from
them an accurate and fairly complete picture of what these languages are
like, without the prerequisites that a more theoretical approach would
have demanded.
2. All of the participants brought to the workshop an extensive
knowledge of the language, acquired through months or years of study,
and (with some exceptions) an exhaustive morpheme concordance of texts
collected in their fieldwork. These slip concordances served as sources of
examples, insights, and challenging ‘residue’. And each participant broughtxiiixivBarasano Syntaxa terrific amount of energy, expended in long hours writing drafts at a very
arduous pace.
3. At the beginning of the workshop, the authors were given a very
general outline, and for each language, the corresponding files (empty
except for the headings) were created on the disk in the computer center.
The authors worked ‘on-line’, adding descriptive text and examples under
the various headings, all the while refining and modifying the initial outline
to fit the structure of the language being described. Consequently, there is
some commonality to the structure of the various grammars, but without
the negative effects of ‘squeezing’ the descriptions into a fixed,
predetermined outline. (Mark Nelson and Bob Reed made the
environment for working on-line very congenial.)
4,In addition to writing grammars, Paul Frank and Grace Hensarling
served as consultants-in-training to other authors. Other linguists
contributed occasional suggestions, most worthy of mention being Janet
Barnes, Terry Malone, and Bob Reed.","[14, 15, 16]"
"12.1. Subject ellipsis. Subject ellipsis may occur in either main clauses
or subordinate clauses. In main clauses, the listener is left to pragmatically
determinethereferent,whichis usuallyunambiguousbecauseofthecontext. In subordinate clauses, subject ellipsis is in most cases obligatory
when the subject is the same as that of the main clause, with the verb of
the subordinate clause marked for agreement of gender and number.
However,whenthereare a seriesof subordinateclauses,onlythefirstverb may be marked, and in some cases, none at all. (See §11.1.)
Subject ellipsis in subordinate clauses is illustrated in (533)-(535). In
(533), the subordinate clause guhi bagu yari ‘because (he) has no teeth’ has
no explicit subject and this indicates that the subject of the subordinate
clause is the subject of the main clause. The main verb of the subordinate165166Barasano Syntaxclause ba ‘to not be’ is marked to agree in gender and number with the
subject of the main clause. In illustration (534) there is marking for gendernumber on the first subordinate clause but the following subordinate
clauses have no inflection on the verbs. Again there is no explicit subject
in the subordinate clauses and this indicates that the subject ye ‘T is the
same as that of the main clause. In illustration (535) there is neither an
explicit subject nor gender-number marking in the subordinate clauses,
again indicating that the subject of the subordinate clauses is subject of the
main clause at the end of the sentence.

Subject ellipsis in main clauses is illustrated in (536)-(538). The first

subject of the sentence is pragmatically interpreted to be ‘they’ (excluding
their father). The choice is limited due to the person-number marking on

manner (besides location); adi ‘this’ is used with locations as affixes, e.g.,adi-tiikuro ‘this area’. It is also used with specific items. When adi ‘this’
occurs with -h# ‘place’ it refers to a specific small area, such as in speaking
of ‘this spot on my clothes’; ado ‘this’ refers to a broader area and does
not require -hx ‘place’ to refer to ‘here, this location’. The form i ‘that’
followed by -hw ‘place’ refers to an area at a distance yet visible to the
speaker, whereas 6 ‘that’, refers to a distance beyond the sight of the
speaker. Illustration (97) shows ado ‘this’ used to modify bahi-ro to express

adi-hai-ri (this-flat“thin-p) ‘these flat thin things’. Some deverbal nouns
(marked by -a/-ka, -/-k#, -ro/-se, and -h#) do not require -ri in the plural.
Instead, adi ‘this’, andti ‘that’, mayoccuraloneto refer to ‘these’and‘those’.
.
Demonstrative pronouns occur with suffixes which generally refer to an
implicit (or previously mentioned) head. When they occur with the head
noun, they follow it since the head noun is generally topicalized in this
position. Illustration (99) shows ti-a ‘that hollow thing’ following the head
noun buhua ‘blowgun’:

"These examples indicate that the nasality of -be (negative) is conditioned
not by the preceding morpheme, but by the following one.
A second example of nasalization spreading to the left is when personal
pronouns are used to form indefinite and demonstrative pronouns. The
personal pronouns are 7 (3ms), so® (3fs), and id4 (3p). These are added to theindefinite nominal gahe ‘other’ to form gahi ‘another male’, gaheo ‘another
female’ and gahéra ‘others’, respectively. Notice that the nasality of the
personal pronoun determines the nasality of the resultant indefinite
pronoun, even though the personal pronoun derivative occurs at the end
of the word. The same pattern occurs with the demonstrative pronouns.
The nominal adi ‘this’ fuses with the personal pronouns to form 4d ‘this
male’ and adio ‘this female’; ado ‘this place’ becomes 4dda ‘these beings’.
(adi ‘this’ is used for a highly specific thing or place whereas ado ‘this’ is
used for a more general area or in reference to manner.)
1.16. Glottal stop. Sentences which end with pronouns (e.g., ye (1s)), the
adverb kéda ‘again’, the discourse marker ya (yuha (£)) ‘now’, or the
sentence fragment #hax ‘yes’, may optionally occur with a final glottal stop.
We regard this phenomenon as outside the segmental phonology, and have
thus not listed the glottal stop as a phoneme.

"4.1-4.4 NounclassifiersBarasano has an extensive system of noun classifiers, which provide
concordance (agreement) within the noun phrase, and are used to form
referring expressions that head noun phrases.
Note examples (139)-(141) which illustrate agreement in the noun
phrase. In (139), -# (classifier for hammock) is the classifier added to hxa
‘two’ (the -a is dropped) which agrees with the object hii# () / hiiuge (Ee)
‘hammock’, In (140), -ga ‘hollow/having a hole’ is the classifier added to ya
(genitive) to agree with the noun kiébua ‘canoe’. In (141) -ka ‘hollow,
having a hole’ is the classifier added to the deverbal nominal hai-busa-ri
which agrees with wewo (specie of reed) (whose singularizer is -a ‘hollow,
having a hole’).",[67]
"32Barasano SyntaxNote that -hxa (selective focus) is added to the interrogative pronouns
for ‘who’ to form interrogative pronouns meaning ‘which’. Also, the root
forms for ‘who’ are yiba- and di-: /yiba + u/ becomes /yibu/ and /yiba +
o/ becomes /yibo/; /di + i/ becomes /di/. There seem to be no restrictions
in the alternation between yiba and di. However, di is used morefrequently for ‘which’ and yiba for ‘who’.
The interrogative pronouns are generally sentence initial and may either
stand alone as a noun phrase or modify the noun they precede. In (93),
the interrogative pronoun stands alone; in (94), it modifies the following
noun (chicken); and in (95) it is not sentence initial but follows a
topicalized phrase.

"12.12-12.13Discoursein TaibanoThis section is a discussion of how action continuity and discontinuity are
signaled in Taibano. Givén defines action continuity as follows: “Action
continuity pertains primarily to temporal sequentiality within (a) thematic
paragraph, but also to temporal adjacency therein... actions are given
primarily in the natural sequential order in which they actually occurred,
and most commonly there is small if any temporal gap... between one
action and the next.” (1983:8)
Action continuity and discontinuities within the paragraph are generally
signaled by means of participles. Participles are defined here as nonfinite
verbs which function as dependent clauses. Participles are categorized into
two classes: those which have no gender-number marking and those which
do. In this discussion we distinguish these two types simply as ‘unmarked
participles’ and ‘marked participles’ (with reference only to gender-number
marking). Unmarked participles are used to maintain action continuity.
Marked ones are those which signal divisions within paragraphs.
Unmarked participles are subdivided into those which have a switch
referencemarkerandthose whichdon’t.",[197]
"Introduction15child’. However, nasalization spreads through the k following a nasal
morpheme, siika-4k4 (baby-p1m) ‘little baby’.
The syllable beginning with b in the suffix -bw (past nonthird person
animate) is oral following an oral morpheme in ahi-be yu. (hear--3psT 1s) ‘I
heard’, but nasalization spreads through the b following a nasal morpheme,
yag6-ba yu (talk--3pst 1s) ‘I spoke.’
The syllables beginning with s and r in the suffixes -se (nominalizer) and
-re (object) are oral in 7 yi-se-re (3ms do-NoM-o) ‘what he did’. However,
with a nasal verb root such as 4bi ‘to pick up’ these suffixes allow the
nasalization to spread through them: i 4bi-sé-ré ‘his thing he picked up’.
The syllable beginning with # in -hw# (distal) is oral following an oral
morpheme as in to-hx ‘there-place’. But nasalization spreads through the
h following a nasal morpheme as in Tibi-y4-ha (otter-river-place) ‘to Otter
River’.
The consonant d occurs in only two suffixes, both of which are always
oral not allowing nasal spreading. However, in the formative verb stems,
nasalization penetrates -di (intransitive). For example, the syllable
beginning with d in budi ‘to exit’ is oral following the oral syllable bu
(which is the transitive verb ‘to make exit’), However, nasalization spreads
through the d following the formative nasal verb stem Addisi in hidisidi ‘to
be angry’.
The previous examples all show the spreading of nasalization to the right
in a word. However, there are a few cases of nasalization spreading to the
left. One such case involves -be (negative). When it occurs with the verb
4bi ‘to pick up’, inflected for nonthird person animate, it is oral as in (44).
From this we would assume that -be (negative) is an intrinsically oral suffix.
However, with the third-person-animate suffixes (which are all nasal) -be
becomes nasal as in (45).

Similarly, when -be (negative) occurs with verbs inflected for nonpast

plural forms of this tense, the suffix following -be (negative) is dé (animate
plural) (an intrinsically nasal suffix) and -be is nasal as in (47).","[32, 33]"

6.8-6.10 Other verb morphology
Theconstructions which indicate causative, motion,and contraexpecta-tion do not fit readily into the previous discussion of the verb phrase and
thus are described below.
6.8. Causatives. Barasano forms morphological causatives by affixing -o
to the verb root. Some examples of this are: wxbd-o (rise-caus) ‘to cause
to arise’, yayi-o (lost-caus) ‘to cause to be lost’, bék#-o (drunk-caus) ‘to
cause to be drunk’, and b&si-o (know-caus) ‘to cause to know’. In (308)
and (309), kati ‘to be alive, well’ is compared with kati-o ‘to cause to be
alive, well’.(308) kati-ya
alive-PRES IMPVbai
2sYou be well!(309) i-re
3ms-O—kati-o-ya
alive-CAUS-PRES
IMPVYoucause him to be well!ba
2sBarasano also has lexical causative verbs derived historically from
morphological causatives. Compare the following transitive verbs with their
intransitive counterparts: ked6 ‘to fix or make’, keda ‘to be good’; wuo ‘to
cause to be mixed’, wusa ‘to be mixed’; tuo ‘to cause to return’, tedi ‘to
return’; fo ‘to show’, fa ‘to see’; and sé ‘to cause to enter’, saha ‘to enter’.“4In causative constructions, the causee (the subject of the embedded
verb), when present, is marked by -re (object), Thus, the causative of a
transitive verb may have two objects (both potentially marked by -re), (See
§5.1-5.3 on the case marker -re.) Note that the direct object of the
causativized clause precedes the causee.44/8ha + of becomes /s6/,102Barasano Syntax(310) ti-re

2sTwo other verbs which may each have two direct objects are ki ‘to put’
and sé ‘to cause to enter’. The first object refers to the position attained
by the second object, which generally appears as a pronoun. For example,
in (78), the first object whw ‘chief is the position attained by the second
object 7 ‘he’.

2.7. Verbs with verbal complements. This kind of verb is called a
manipulative verb, defined by Givén as a verb whose object (usually
animate) is manipulated to perform the act or state referred to in the
verbal complement (1984:123). The verbs roti ‘to order, request’ and
eharébo ‘to help’ are the two verbs known to be used in this manner.",[45]

Morphology
This chapter is a summary of derivational morphology that is not
discussed elsewhere. It is divided into two major sections: noun
morphology and verb morphology.
The section on noun morphology includes a brief discussion of the
gender-number suffixes for nouns, the nominalizers for deverbal nouns, the
diminutive -aka, and the use of -a to combine nouns with nominals and
classifiers. The section on verb morphology includes a brief discussion of
verb roots and intensifiers.","[58, 59]"

pattern for ov languages. Accordingly, (a) it is a suffixing language; (b)
there are only postpositions (no prepositions); (c) in noun phrases, the
genitive precedes the head; (d) auxiliary verbs follow the main verb; and
(e) modals are verb suffixes. Although there is variation in the order of
descriptive modifiers (for pragmatic reasons), the typical order is that the
modifier precedes the head. There are no relative clauses,1.12-1.17 Phonology
1.12, Phonemes. Barasano has 23 phonemes: eleven consonants and
twelve vowels which are presented in (35) and (36). Vowels are of six
qualities, each with its nasalized counterpart (indicated by a tilde). The
symbols used here and throughout the examples represent a modified9Introduction
phonemic orthography. The phonemein parenthesis is found only in loanwords from Spanish or another Tucanoan language.

hearer based on the lexical content of the verbs and the general context. The
overt markers are employed only with adverbial clauses.
11.2. Switch reference morphemes. The same-subject switch reference
morphemes are the animate nominalizers listed in (122) in chapter 3. These
nominalizers show agreement in gender and number with the subject of the
main clause. In (430), the nominalizer -g# (masculine singular) identifies the
subject of the dependent clause as also the subject of the main clause.",[156]

with them’. However, the restricting clause may occur in the sentence
without sigo and be grammatically acceptable. See §11.4-7, for more on
this topic.

In (559), all the information of the conditional clause is anaphoric, in the
sense that the previous actions have been based on the assumption that
the participants are relatives. The effect of using -dé (spacer) within the
conditional clause is to highlight the information which precedes it (‘my

“You (will) do that too, if you are my relative,” (he) said to him.
The flow from more important to less important information may also be
marked by ridé ‘only, just’ in which the sense of -dé (spacer) appears to be
inherent. This word is used for conveying no change in a situation or
event, or for conveying the limit of number of persons or things. In (560),
ridé occurs in a recapping of the description of what the formerly dead
husband said when he arrived again at the house.” (See also §12.8.)PThe -hua (selective focus) in ria-hua-re-bd is used to show that there is a switch in
participants, in this instance in the objective case (markedby -re) and followed by -b4(contrastive focus) which signifies that what was done to the previously mentioned object is
not done to this object. -b4@ (contrastive focus) and -dé (spacer) are mutually exclusive.
Sentence (554) is similar. The effect of using -dé (spacer) is to highlight ‘meat’, the food
referred to in (553) which was not good food for humans,
The presence of ridé following i ‘he’ in (557) is similar to the use of dé in (554) as it
highlights ‘him’ over against ‘she made the good juices for’.","[191, 192]"

With verbs of motion which have -a (motion), the tense-evidential
markers for intention remain the same. The contracted forms for nonthird
person of the intention tense are formed by dropping h from -ha (nonthird
person), ¢.g., instead of -rva-ra-ha as in (270), one says -rea-ra-a
(DESID-anp--3). Theform-reo-ko-hais contractedto -reo-ko-a(DESIDfs-fs--3),and for third person the b is dropped, as when -r#o-ko-b6 becomes -rao-kd

becomes-ri-ki (DESIDms-3ms),6.7. Aspect. In addition to the various tenses discussed above, there are
further constructions which denote aspect—fulfillment, progressive,
anticipatory, habitual, durative and iterative.
Fulfillment. The aspect of fulfillment expressed by -kod includes both
completive aspect (defined here as viewing an event from its end point),
as well as the related idea of fulfillment of an expectation. The illustrations
below show first of all the completive aspect with -koa, followed by a
discussion of the fulfillment aspect.
In (271), -koa (fulfillment) is followed by -7i (sequential participle) with
the motion verb wa ‘to move’. Here the sense is that the act of going is
completed, which in this case, means that the participants arrived.

7.6. Subordinate clauses. Subordinate clauses generally precede main
clauses. The basic word order for subordinate clauses is object-verb. This
order accords with that of main clauses. However, when the subject of the
subordinate clause is different from that of the main clause, the subject is
generally an obligatory constituent of the subordinate clause and
immediately precedes the nominalized verb (except in those cases where
objects have been incorporated into verbs). Compare (346), where the
subject of the subordinate clause is omitted because it is the same as the
main clause, with (347) where the subject 7 (ms) of the subordinate clause
occurs before the verb yi ‘to say’.

11,20. Verb for commands. The verb roti ‘to order or request’ is used with
infinitival verbs as complements or with a verbal complement. When used with
an infinitive to express ‘in order to’, the subject of the infinitive is the same as
the object of roti which is marked by -re (object). The order is object/subject,
infinitive (embedded verb), and roti ‘to order or request’—see (527), The
embedded verb may have its own object in which case it also is marked with
-re (object) as in (528). Note the negated form of roti in (529) signifying ‘to
order not to’.

"184 Jess common way of expressing the genitive plural is by following ye (genitive plural)
with the noun to which it refers, e.g, ida ye sita (3p GENp land) ‘their land’. Also, at least in
one dialect of Janerd, it is acceptable to simply stale the possessor prior to the possessed
(without ya), e.g.,: 7 fie ‘his hammock’,
19.wi ‘house’ is not written as suffixed to proper nouns and pronouns (our own bias). wii
‘house’ is the word used when it is not suffixed to a noun.",[79]

Another specific method of coordinating nominalized constructions is
used when describing the various characteristics within a group. In such
cases, yd ‘to be’ occurs uninflected at the end of each nominalized
construction; and the main verb of the sentence is bahi ‘to be’, which refersto the manner in which entities exist—see (421).

10.2. Disjunction. Disjunction is defined as the coordinating of
alternative nominals or clauses. Such an expression begins with ba
(uncertainty), which is an interjection that signifies that the speaker is
uncertain of what he is about to say. (It may occur by itself as a response
indicating that the speaker is uncertain as to how to respond.)
Alternatives are often coordinated by first expressing a limitation before
proceeding with the alternatives. Once the limit has been determined in
the general context, the interjection ba (uncertainty) is the only
construction necessary to indicate that alternatives are being considered.
For example, in the conversation beginning with (423) the speaker
declared that he wanted one piece of cloth. He was then asked what sort
of cloth (color) it was that he desired and (424) was his response. NoticeCoordination135that there is no object marker on either of the alternatives. This also
indicates that the speaker does not have a specific piece of cloth in mind.(423) koho-hai

Following ba (uncertainty), when other than the present proximate tense
is used, the tense of the main verb is generally either past or nonpast
conjecture. Also, the two alternatives are often inflected with -hua
(selective focus), which reflects that the speaker is considering them as
parts of a domain he has set in his mind.
In (425), the two nominals Jim and Bob are coordinated and the markers
for the tense-evidential of nonpast conjecture is used. Or, the same
meaning will result by repeating a nominalized form of the main verb after
each alternative, and ending the sentence with an auxiliary verb inflected
for the tense of past or nonpast conjecture. In (426), kda-gu ‘send’ is
repeated, separating the two clauses and yi ‘to do’ is the auxiliary verb
referring back to both of the clauses.

1sA conditional clause is frequently added following the main clause, e.g., yxyi-haba ‘if I do it’ in order to emphasize even more the uncertainty of the
speaker. By adding this clause to (426), the expression could be translated,
‘I don’t know. If I send someone, I will either send Jim or I will send Bob.’136Barasano SyntaxAn extra cue that the speaker is considering alternatives is that he
hesitates between the alternatives, as English speakers often do, making
the sound #& as he thinks of the other alternative. Some speakers have
borrowed o ‘or’ from Spanish to use for this construction.","[151, 152, 153, 154]"
"In addition,onemusttakeinto accountthe areasofanimacy, subject or nonsubject of the verb, negation, and the
tense-evidential marking for nominalizations. The next section discusses
those markers which are not bound to any specific time, i.e., they have notense-evidential marking and are interpreted to signify the tense of current
relevance (present). Following that is a discussion of the negated forms of
the nominalizers not bound by time, then the tense-evidential markers for
nominalizers, and finally nominalizations in apposition.
11.4, Nominalizations not bound by time. The nominalizers which refer
to general or nonspecific items and beings are the same as those listed in (122)
in chapter 3. They occur immediately following the verb and indicate animacy
and number. The animate nominalizers distinguish masculine, feminine and
plural—see (439).
The inanimate nominalizers -ro/-do/-to are used for
quantities, places, times and manner—see (440)-(442); -ro may also be used
immediately following a verb root to refer to a single but general object—see142Barasano Syntax(443); and it may be used for referring to either the subject or nonsubject. Forexample,withthe nominalization giiba-ro (wrap*around“oneself-NoM)‘something to wrap around oneself -ro refers to the nonsubject item that might
be used to do the wrapping (not the wrapper). However with the time word
yoa-ro (long-NoM) -ro refers to the subject ‘time’.

with a nominalization which is anything other than the subject of the
verb—see (447)-(448); they are also used to refer to nonindividuated items

subject of the action, see (449)-(451).

The nominalizations used for referring to specific items or persons all
contain -ri (participle) immediately following the verb, followed by either
another nominalizer, a noun, a gender-number marker, or a classifier. Thisis used for both animate and inanimate—see (452)-(453), with animate
humans the nominal bas- ‘human’ is required following -ri. Nominalizers
which follow -ri are -ro and -se (depending on the dialect). The subject of
the verb may be a noun or pronoun preceding the nominalization which is
not marked for subject—see (454). Nominalizations which refer to items or
persons that are anything other than the subject of the verb have -a(nonsubject nominalizer) following -ri (participle)—see (455)-(456). © A

"The basic wordtypology overview
order in main,Barasano is ov, with the subject generally following the verb.
When a pronoun occurs which refers to the subject, it immediately
follows the predicate verb. Compare (2), a simple ov construction, with (3)
where the object and verb are followed by the pronoun ida ‘they’, followed
by two noun phrases which clarify to whom ‘they’ refers. This statement
was a response to the question, “Why have you come?’

"(41)kabié‘canoes’kiibu-4‘canoe’ari‘fish traps’ari-a‘fish trap’Class four consists solely of the suffix -ro (augmentative). This suffix is
always low in pitch and seems to draw the accent to the syllable preceding
it. Thus, hdai-ri-ka ‘big canoe’ becomes hai-ri-ka-ro ‘really big canoe/boat’,
and kdbé-rahe ‘can’ becomes kdbe-rahé-ro ‘big can’.
Now consider the high-pitch continuity of verbs. Most verb roots are two
syllables long with the stress on the second syllable. Where the stress falls
on the first syllable, the pitch usually remains high on the second syllable.
Verb suffixes fall into three classes:
1. Those which have low pitch. (This is the more general case.)
2. Those which pull the stress to themselves, hence carrying secondary
stress,
3. Those which carry the primary word stress: a) negative suffix, and b)
suffixes signifying proximity with the irregular motion verb wadi ‘to
come’.
Most verb suffixes fall into class one having low pitch. The following verb
illustrates three of these suffixes: buh4-koa-a-ha (find-FF-pREs--3) ‘I found
it. Notice that all three suffixes are low pitch, even though the final
syllable of the root is high.",[30]

which refer to nonsubject.
When referring to the subject of the verb, -be (negative) is used. It
follows the verb root and precedes a nonproximate nominalizer. For
animates the nonproximate nominalizers are -k¢# (masculine singular), -ko63]n the singular constructions -a (nonsubject) is dropped, ie. /ri + a + o/ becomes /rio/
and /ri +
classifier.a + w/ becomes /-ri/. This is also the case for inanimates which have -# as aSubordination145(feminine singular) and -da (ananimate plural)—see (458). For inanimates
the nonproximate nominalizer is ti, This is the negative counterpart of -se
(nominalizer). Thus, when -fi occurs alone (with no noun or pronoun
preceding it to indicate subject), it refers to the subject of the negated
verb, For example, the positive form with the stative verb aba ‘to be soft’
is aba-se ‘that which is soft’ and the negated form is seen in (459). A
classifier follows -ti for nominalizations which refer to specific man-made
items as in (460).

When referring to anything but the subject, the negated form of the
general nominalizer is -a (nonsubject), followed by the negative verb ba
‘not be’, which is inflected by the animate nominalizers -gw (masculine
singular), -go (feminine singular), -dé (animate plural), and the inanimatenominalizer di. Examples of this are (461) and (462), where the latter
refers to those animals which are not food, nor used for anything. (For
