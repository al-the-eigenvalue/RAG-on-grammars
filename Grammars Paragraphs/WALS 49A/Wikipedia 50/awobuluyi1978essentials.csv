"‘P, Oj6, Aind, Bist, etc. The logic of distinguishing between

one that has already occurred.
Similarly, the adjective kik? in:

As in the case of nouns/nominalisations, adjectives are
not derived from plain verbs, but rather from verb phrases.

English for guidance. Such a person must find guidance for
himself within the Yoruba language itself and there only.

the fact that they are differentiated for number and person,

36The number of adjectives in the language is quite large. The
vast majority, if not all, of such adjectives are derived. They
are derived from nouns and verb phrases in relative clauses
(see 6.18 below). For example:

(good (character) ) die
rere
(drinking)
mimu
(black)
dada
(cooked)
sise
funfun (white)

class are all derived from nouns with or without their own
qualifiers in relative clauses (see 6.18 below). Examples are

(brave hunter)in this class are traditionallyknownas nouns,and are said to be in apposition to the nouns they accompany.
Actually, however, such words are qualifiers, because theirrelation to the nouns they occur with is exactly the sameasthe one between adjectives, for instance, and the nouns they
qualify. Thus, in:
Sidi, iyaw6é mi(Sidi, my wife)the appositive qualifier iydwé mi narrows down the range of
people that Sfd{ could refer to.maerelative clauses qualifying ¢ni (person),
(while, period), and several other nouns.kindAdjectivesAn appositive qualifier and the noun it qualifies alwaysrefer to the same thing. For this reason, it is always possible
to drop the noun qualified without any significant loss of
meaning. Thus, these two sentences mean practically the
same thing:(My wife, Sidi, has returned.)
(My wife has returned.)Sidi, iyaw6 mi ti dé.

syntactic behaviour is used to arrive at the following subclasses of nouns.*2.12 Human Nouns
