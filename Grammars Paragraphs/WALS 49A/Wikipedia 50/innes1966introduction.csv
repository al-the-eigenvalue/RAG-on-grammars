both nasal; nasality of the vowels is therefore not marked:

Determinatives na and nc are probably to be identified with the first part of the
demonstrative adjectives (see p. 45).
ADVERBSThe class of adverbs, like the other major word classes, is syntactically defined.
The position which is relevant for the setting up of the adverb class is that occupied
by dé ‘again’ in the sentence Do nuna nc ne dé ‘Do did it again’, and the corresponding
position in other sentences of the same structural type. Of the words which occur
in this position, some are readily identified as nouns or as postpositions, since they
occur also in the test frames used for setting up these two word classes. But there
are others which are confined to occurrence in this position, and which do not belong
to any of the word classes so far established. These constitute the class of Adverbs.
Some common adverbs are:
baka 21
dekedeke 3232
dOdo 32very, greatly
from now on, henceforward

te 3-2although
when, since
as, in the manner that
not so thatEach of the above adverbs occurs with a considerable number of verbs, but there
are other adverbs, each of which is confined to occurrence with one particular verb,
or with only a very few verbs. Words of this kind, which are called Ideophones,
form a sub-group of the adverb class.
Some common ideophones are:
gbéu 33
huu 22
h~è 22of the sound of a clap
of the sound of steady wind or of a siren
of the sound of a small quantity of liquid boilingkodokodo 2222
kôkfl 2-12-I
kp~O 33steadily

of being very hot
stiffly, rigidly, erect.
CONJUNCTIONSA class is established of words which occur in place of blanc ‘nevertheless’ and
ke ‘but’ in sentences like:
flu fflad~ ne blanc ~ did~ ne
ne munade ne kc ne ylda na yiit rained yesterday, nevertheless he came
I went there but I did not see him.","[23, 24]"
"In compounds, the first noun has its lexical tone and the second noun has tone 3
(or 33 in the case of CVCV nouns), except where the first noun has final lexical tone
2-1 and the second has lexical tone 1, 2-1 or 2 (11, 21 or 22 with CVCV nouns); in
these latter compounds the tone pattern is 2 1 (or 2 11):

derived from du ‘marry’.
2. TENE GEDEBO NU WOE262 Gédébo: for the traditional Grebo account of the origin of the name Gédébo,
seep. 131.
263 dak~ no m~ Gédébo: ‘that nation which is Grebo’; a nominal phrase consisting
of antecedent daka no
relative clause m~ Gédébo; dak~ (p1. dakoc), though
formally singular, is here accompanied by the plural determinative no, and
is always referred to by a plural pronoun.
263 dede: a derivative verb from de, the secondary stem of da ‘call’; dade ‘call with,
call by’.
263 nec: contraction of ne ne ‘that it is’; the first ne is 3rd p1. emphatic pronoun,
the second ne is a particle (see p. 104).
265 nyene de ne m~ Gédébo: ‘the name Grebo’; a nominal phrase consisting of
antecedent nyene de ne
relative clause m~ Gédébo.
266 Pânyo: a compound whose IC’s are Pa and nyo ‘persons’ (sg. ny~). The people
known by the Grebo as Panyo are called Kran by Westermann in the Hand
book of African Languages; according to him the Kran are called Pahn (a
nickname) by the Grebo. The Kran occupy an area between the Rivers Cess
and Cavalla, inland from the Kru, and extending into the Ivory Coast.
268 Gb~bo: the name Gb~bo, which according to the tradition related in this text
was the earlier name of the Grebo, is said by Sapir to be the name by which
the Grebo are called by the Gweabo-speaking tribes (E. Sapir ‘Notes on the
Gweabo Language of Liberia’ Language 1931).
268 Pãnyo a do be: ‘some of the Kran’; be ‘other’ in this phrase expresses the notion
of the Kran as opposed to all other peoples, and may be compared with
autres in a French phrase like nous autres francais.
270 nenao ne: repetition of neo; ‘before yesterday’ tense; neo consists of ne ‘be’
-o ‘there’.
270 he ne a yie ~jwe: ‘what you have not heard’; a nominal phrase consisting of
antecedent he ne + relative clause a yie ijwe, which is the 2nd p1. ‘today’ tense
of the indicative mood negative of ijwe ‘hear’.
272 kpokpod~da: verbal noun from kpokpod~, a derivative verb consisting of CV
kpod~ ‘scrape’; ijwi n~ kpokpod~da ‘word scraping’, i.e. ‘argument’.
272 muna mu: repetition of mu ‘go’; ‘before yesterday’ tense.
273 hw~ena: ‘before yesterday’ tense of hw3ë, a derivative verb with causative
meaning from hw3 ‘fight’.
274 tadao ta: repetition of tao ‘look there’; tao consists of ta ‘see’ + -o ‘there’.
274 kona p0 mo ne m~: this is a common saying; kona is here used as a term of
address, and po is imperative mood
‘knee, help me!’ The meaning is of
course that safety lies in flight.
275 bá ne ha kwidé: commands in the 1st p1., which are expressed by the subjunctive
mood, are commonly preceded by ha ne, a 2nd p1. subjunctive form which
also expresses a command; ne is a defective verb which occurs only in corn—155mands
‘come along, come on’, hence ha ne bà kwidé is ‘come on, let us
flee’; ha ne may be omitted, with little change of meaning.
275 a ne te n~ we: optative mood negative, which here expresses a negative purpose
‘so that we may not be finished’; see p. 117.
276 ii yidé we: 1St p1. indicative mood negative of wede.
276 gbe: a circle of people surrounding combatants or a low barrier separating two
combatants, which allows them to exchange blows but prevents their pushing
each other, and thus makes fairer a fight between men of different weight.
276 wede e gbe: ‘be able for its barrier’, i.e. ‘to endure it, to withstand it’.
278 kpaeda: ‘before yesterday’ tense of kpee, a derivative verb with causative mean
ing from kpa ‘take’
‘it caused them to take a whole year’, i.e. ‘it took a
whole year’.
280 dabe a nyibétu: a switch from 3rd to 2nd person is not uncommon in narrative,
and several examples of it occur in this text.
280 bléé de: ‘things carried on the head, headloads’; bléé is a pre-nominal verbal
adjective derived from blé ‘carry on the head’.
280 a mina Ia: 2nd p1. ‘before yesterday’ tense of the optative mood of la; the op
tative mood here expresses a wish or intention.
282 kpuikpununa: verbal noun; ijme n~ kpiikpununa ‘butting’, i.e. ‘disagreement,
friction’.
283 be tee e te: ‘if it is its matter’, i.e. ‘if it is the case’.
283 ne p0: imperfective indicative mood negative of ~0 ‘throw’.
287 pod~: ‘after tomorrow’ tense imperative mood of p0.
287 tuu: pre-nominal verbal adjective derived from tu ‘say’; tuu te ‘matters for
discussion’.
288 nyebabo a pepe: ‘all the men’; pape occurs very commonly as the ‘possessed’
word in a genitival phrase like this.
289 k~ mó k~ bae: lit. ‘you and companion’; this phrase strengthens pepa
‘all
without exception, absolutely all’.
293 be yl nulé: conditional mood negative of nuié, a derivative verb from flu ‘do’;
nulé has passive meaning
‘if this is not done’.
294 e na m~: 3rd p1. subjunctive mood negative of m~ ‘be’.
296 he ne a ti: lit. ‘what we are discussing’, i.e. ‘soon afterwards’; a nominal phrase
consisting of antecedent he ne + relative clause a ti.
296 a kuplu: a is 3rd sg. possessive pronoun, referring to the secret discussions
mentioned; a kupiu ‘a fool connected with this matter’.
297 nya ylda nyene k~: lit. ‘a person did not have a wife’, i.e. ‘as if nobody else had
a wife’.
300 tébé ne a ne: ‘however it may be, whatever the outcome may be’.
301 iédêda: verbal noun from lédé ‘tell’, object of nuna ‘did’.
305 ~ ne hudidi: 3rd sg. imperfective indicative mood negative.
306 pie: yes/no questions are commonly marked by initial pie and final question
marker unit V4 (see p. 28).
307 koeo
ye: ‘about, concerning’; koco ha woda bio na no ke ye ‘concerning our
leaving this land’; ha wode bio n~ no ke ‘let us leave this land’ is a holophrastic
subjunctive (see p. 76).

"Relative
Sg.a, u 3/4P1.o, e 3/4The relative pronouns have tone 4 when they occur before a verbal stem which has
tone 4; in all other contexts they have tone 3.
The relative pronouns correspond in English to both ‘who’ and ‘whose’; they
occur in sentences like:
yu na a buô a ylda a ko ne
2-11311344221314314442334the chief who came yesterday said it4For particle ne which occurs finally in these three sentences, see p. 104; for na and
no which occur as second word in these sentences, see p. 47.
6.bia
dothe chiefs whose houses we saw yesterday have come44222k~ na a did;,;, tuda ne ne
1Pronoun ~ is used not only of small things but also of uncountables:1k~bo no o Ida a ylda o di ne
12the child whose father we saw is deadthe part of the body is that of a small animal like a mouse, or of a bird or insect.
Generally, in the case of things where a considerable range of sizes is possible, the
larger specimens are referred to bye, and the smaller by c: dakae ‘umbrella’ is nor
mally referred to by a, but when a toy umbrella is denoted, this is referred to by c.
Some things which are nonnally referred to by a may be referred to by c, this latter
then having a strong contemptuous or insulting connotation. Even a person may
be contemptuously referred to by e.
Some small things, on the other hand, which are normally referred to by £ are
referred to by~ when the referent is unusually large or expensive: ijwuna kpôbô ‘lip’
is normally referred to by e, but when it denotes a badly swollen lip, it is referred
to by a.",[26]
"Ne does not occur with the indicative mood forms listed on p. 78; with these the
subject is emphatic. Compare for example:
kë nuna ne
1324the chief did itk~ nuna ne ne the chief did it
12243ma nuna ne1324I did itne nuna ne ne I did it
11243Adjunct position
Adjunct position comes after object position; except in the case of indicative
mood sentences of tenses 1-4, adjunct position comes immediately after object po
sition; in the case of indicative mood sentences of tenses 1-4, particle ne (or no) can
occur between object and adjunct positions:
a duda bia ne teehe pounded rice wellIn this sentence tee occurs in adjunct position.
Since object position and adjunct position both follow the verb, it is necessary
to have some criteria for distinguishing these two positions. Two criteria are in
fact used:
1. In the affirmative indicative mood, ne (no after ma ‘be’) occurs after the object,
and thus marks off object position from adjunct position:
ne duda bla ne Male
ne dudi bia sil ne MaleI pounded rice on Monday
I pounded rice with a pestle on MondayIn the second sentence bla ‘rice’ and sfl ‘pestle’ are both in object position.
ne muna London ne Male I went to London on Monday
ne mana kë no Male
I was chief on Monday
1052. In the corresponding negative sentences formed with auxiliary verb the object
(or objects) occurs before the main verb:
ne yida bla du Male
ne ylda bla sfl dudi Male
ne yida London mu Male
ne ylda kê ma MaleI did not pound rice on Monday
I did not pound rice with a pestle on Monday
I did not go to London on Monday
I was not chief on Mondayne yida na ne kae
ne yida na ne ke kae ye
~3.déagain
ne nuna nc ne dé
I did it again
putu for nothing
a nuna ne ne putu
he did it for nothing
kodokodo (of tying) tightly
ne moana ne ne kodokodo I tied it very tightlyNouns
(a) denoting time: Male Monday
Do nuna ne ne MaleTwo (or, rarely, more) expressions can occur in adjunct position:Do did it on Mondayne yida na ne ke London Male 1 I saw him in London on Monday
ne yida na ne Male ke London(b) denoting place: s3 farm; London. These are preceded by ke ‘there’:
ne yida na ne ke s5
ne yida na ne ke LondonI saw him on the farm
I saw him in LondonIt will be recalled that several words like s3 ‘farm’ and London occur in object
position after mu ‘go’. That these are in object position and not in adjunct position
is shown by the place of ne in affirmative indicative mood sentences and by the oc
currence of s5 and London before the main verb in verbal phrases containing an
auxiliary verb:
ne muna London ne
ne ylda London muI went to London
I did not go to LondonVery common in adjunct position are nominal phrases whose 2nd IC is ka ‘manner,
way’; in Grebo literature ka is always written joined to the preceding word:
a ne ne boaka
a du fufu yabaka
a hlé ne yuka
a hlê Gèdébéka
2.he walks like a fat person
he has pounded the fufu soft
he speaks like a child
he speaks like a Grebocf. boa
cf. yaba
cf. yu
cf. Gédébébe fat
be soft
child
a GreboIn these two examples, ke London is best treated as a single syntactical unit. Both
ke London and Male are in adjunct position, and in this position the order of these
two expressions relative to each other is not fixed.
Nominal sentences
The shortest nominal sentences have two structural positions, the first of which
can be filled by a noun or nominal phrase, singular or plural, or by an emphatic
pronoun; second position can be filled only by particle no:
kë no 1 3
that is the chief
Sentences of this type occur more commonly as linked answers than as initiating
sentences:
(Nya ne?) Ma no
(Who is it?) It’s me.
There are no negative nominal sentences; the negative of sentences like kë no and
ma no is supplied by verbal sentences:
e yi ma
it’s not me.","[52, 53]"

1. Phrases in which the antecedent is picked up by the subject of the relative
clause, as in the English sentence ‘I saw the chief who came yesterday’.
In relative clauses of this type the indicative mood forms listed on pp. 78-79 occur.
Where the antecedent is a nominal clause whose 2nd iC is a demonstrative adjective,
94314121221that chief I saw yesterday (is dead)ke n~ no h~ n~ ne yad~ (~ ko ne)
11441121221Relative pronouns ~ 3, e 3 (p1. o 3, e 3) commonly occur as possessive pronouns in

common except in the case of a preceding nominal phrase whose 2nd IC is a de
monstrative adjective:
433the chief who came yesterday (said it)1442334314422. Phrases in which the antecedent is picked up by some word other than the
subject of the relative clause, as in the English sentence ‘I saw the king whom they
dethroned’.
The ordinary indicative mood (without particle ne) occurs in relative clauses in
phrases of this type:
1The antecedent of a relative clause may be a noun, a nominal phrase or a pronoun
(see p. 52).
The antecedent is followed by determinative n~ 1, ne 1 (p1. no 1, ne I), except where
the antecedent is a nominal phrase whose 2nd IC is a demonstrative adjective (see
p. 45):414423314the chief who came yesterday said itk~ n~ no ne yid~ (~ ko ne)Antecedent + Relative Clause11that chief who came yesterday said it3the chief I went to is dead1In all the above sentences h~ is optional, and this has been indicated by placing it
within brackets.
95Longer phrases
Only the shortest phrases of types 1 to 7 have been described above; also very
common are longer phrases of the same structural types in which a nominal phrase
occurs in place of a noun.
Some examples of longer nominal phrases are:
kae hwe lé behind the big house
This is a phrase of type 2, with the following IC’s:
1st IC: kae hwc big house
2nd IC: lé behind
kae hwc is a phrase of type 3, with IC’s kae ‘house’ and hw~ ‘big’
a k~ a kae our chief’s house
This is a genitival phrase, with the following IC’s:
1st IC: a k~ our chief
2nd IC: a (genitival link)
3rd IC: kae house
a kë is a phrase of type 5, with IC’s a ‘our’ and kë ‘chief’
a k~ kuu our wicked chief
This is a phrase of type 5, with the following IC’s:
1st IC: a our
2nd IC: kë kuu wicked chief
kë kuu is a phrase of type 3, with IC’s kë ‘chief’ and kuu ‘wicked’
a ké kuu a kae hwc our wicked chief’s big house
This is a genitival phrase, with the following IC’s:
1St IC: a k~ kuu our wicked chief
2nd IC: a (genitival link)
3rd IC: kae hw8 big house
Also to be noted here are nominal phrases of type 1 whose 2nd IC is the phrase
b~ ne~ ‘each, every’. B~ ne~ is probably related to the 3rd sg. subjunctive mood form
b~ neo ‘let him be’; neo is a derivative verb consisting of ne ‘be’
-o ‘there’.
B~ ne~ occurs with singular nouns in phrases like:
k~ b~ ne~ every chief~ each chief
IC’s: kê and b~ ne~
ny~ ba ne~ each person, each one, every person
IC’s: ny~ and b~ ne~
Ny~ b~ ne~ commonly occurs as 2nd IC in the phrases:
96a ny~ b~ ne~
322a ny~ b~ ne~
11212each of you11o nya b~ ne~
1each of us11each of them11These three are all phrases of type 5; the 1st IC is a possessive pronoun, and the
2nd IC is the phrase ny~ b~ ned.
Note on phrases containing d~ and de
The two nouns d~ and de, which are commonly translated by the prop-word ‘one’
in English, occur in most of the types of phrase listed above:
suku d~
d~ gy5ü
da na no
k~ a da
na daa school one
a red one
this one
the chief’s one
my oneType 4
Type 3
Type 3
Type 7
Type 5The differences in usage between da and de is comparable with that between pro
nouns a and ~ (see p. 52).
Nominal phrases of the types illustrated by the first three examples above com
monly occur as 2nd IC of a phrase whose 1st IC is a possessive pronoun:
na suku da my school one
IC’s: na and suku da
a da gy5ui his red one; a red one
IC’s: a and da gy3ü
na da na no this one of mine
IC’s: na and da na no; da na no has IC’s da and na no.
It is to be noticed that a da gy5ü means both ‘his red one’ and ‘a red one’. Compare
the pairs:
da gy5fl
a red one
a da gy5ü a red one; his red onedu gy5ü
s d~ gy3ü}a red oneWhere the meaning is ‘a red one’, there is agreement between pronoun and da, dc,
i.e. both have vowel a or both have vowel ~; pronoun a can occur before du gy5ii,
and the meaning of the phrase is ‘his red one’. Compare also:
da na nothis oneType 3; IC’s: da and na no
97d~i n~ no this one; this
one of his
dc ne no this one
c dc nc no this one
~ d~i nc no this one of hisType 5; IC’s: ~ and d~ n~ noCHAPTER 11Type 3; IC’s: da and nc no
Type 5; IC’s: E and da n~ no
Type 5; IC’s: ~ and dc nc noSIMPLE SENTENCESThere seems to be little or no difference in meaning between the members of pairs
like dc n~ no and c dc nc no.
Phrases consisting of do/dc + verbal adjective, either pre-nominal or post-nominal,
always occur as 2nd IC of a type 5 phrase (i.e. one whose 1st IC is a possessive pro
noun):
~ féké d~
~ d~ féké
~ d~ fékéb~a light one~sflfld~,
~ da suub~j~ a deaf one1cf. féké be lightcf. sube deaf~ süü d~ is a nominal phrase of type 5, with IC’s ~ and süü d~
sflu d~ is a nominal phrase of type 3, with IC’s süü and d~
~ d~ sflüb~ is a nominal phrase of type 5, with IC’s ~ and d~ süüb~
d~ süüb is a nominal phrase of type 3, with IC’s d~ and süüb~.
Phrases like ~ sflfl d~ and ~ d~ sflüb~ are of course comparable with phrases like:
naduubla

na bla duuba j my pounded rice
These are both nominal phrases of type 5, whose 1st IC is na, and whose 2nd IC is
duu bla and bla duuba respectively.","[47, 48, 49]"

Consonants
The consonant units are represented by the following letters and digraphs:
p, b, t, d, k, g, kp, gb, ky, gy, hm, m, hn, n, ny, ij, gm, hi, I, f, s, h, hw, w, gw, y.
Most of these have the values which they commonly have in West African languages
and call for no comment; a few, however, require a brief explanatory note:
ky and gy are palatal plosives
hm, hn, hi, hw are the voiceless correlates of m, n, 1, w respectively
gin is a voiced labio-velar nasal
ijw is a voiced nasal semi-vowel
1 has a nasal variant which occurs as second consonant in clusters which are
found as the result of syncopation in quick speech (see p. 15):
flã[fift]<fonawood-boring insecth and hw have each a nasal variant which occurs in nasal syllables only:
ho [hO]
hw~O[h*ftO]shark
shoulderVowels
Nine oral vowels are distinguished, and these are written:
I, e, é, a, a, ~,, 0, 0, U.
Of these, only the pairs e, é and o, 0 call for comment; e and é are both half-close
front vowels, and o and ô are both half-close back vowels. They are perhaps best
described in the terminology used by Sapir’ for comparable pairs of vowels in Gwea
bo, a language closely related to Grebo. In Sapir’s terms é and ô are ‘muffled’ vowels,
and e and o are ‘bright’ vowels.

"Verb with tense suffixThe tone of the tense suffixes has been described earlier (see p. 65). A noun object
has its lexical tone, except that a noun with lexical tone 2 (or 22 in the case of CVCV
nouns) has tone 1 (or 11) following -da ‘yesterday’; after all other tense suffixes a
noun with lexical tone 2 has tone 2 or tone 3 in free variation.
Particles ne and no
In affirmative indicative mood sentences of tenses 1 to 4, particle ne or no usually
occurs after the verb, or after the object, where there is one; no occurs with ma ‘be’,
and ne with all other verbs:
ne duda Ma ne

This suffix unit i~ of course of the trivial kind mentioned briefly at the beginning
of this chapter, and if all plurals formed with it were like those listed above it would
call for no comment. But as well as plural forms like the above, plural forms are
also extremely common in which stem-final vowel + suffix is realized as:
(a) a sequence of two vowels, with change of stem-final vowel, or
(b) a single vowel (a or a).
In some cases the realization of stem-final vowel
suffix as a sequence of two vowels
or as a single vowel is phonologically determined, and all such cases are noted below;
with all other stems it is not possible to predict from the shape of the singular stem
what the realization of stem-final vowel + suffix will be, and it would be necessary

24232you praised each other21The tones of the subject pronoun and of the verbal stem are constant in all tenses
within any given mood for all persons except the 2nd sg. and the 1st p1. Hence from
the paradigms in Table 1 and the description of the tone of the tense suffixes given
above, the tone patterns for all persons other than 2nd sg. and 1st p1. may be deduced
for all tenses of the indicative mood of CV verbal stems of all tone classes. In the
2nd sg. and 1st p1. the following tonal rules apply:
In the 2nd sg., verb stems of tone classes 2 and 3-2 have tone 3 before tense suffixes
-c, -da, -a, -da ‘after tomorrow’ and derivative suffixes -de and -e, and tone 4 in all
other contexts.
In the 1st p1., the pronouns and the verbal stem both have tone 3 where the verbal
stem belongs to tone class 2 or 3-2, and is followed by tense suffixes -c, -da, -a, -d~
‘after tomorrow’ or derivative suffixes -de ‘instrumental’ and -e ‘causative’, and
tone 4 in all other contexts. For example:
a du nc neyou set it for Do today2CV- and -de ‘reciprocal’The tone patterns of the reciprocal forms are most conveniently described by
means of paradigms. The tense 2 indicative mood forms are listed below; the tone
patterns of the 2nd and 3rd p1. are the same, hence it is necessary to list only one
of them:

It may be noted that in all tenses of the indicative, subjunctive, conditional and
result moods the 3rd sg., 2nd and 3rd p1. have the same tone pattern, and that in
69all tenses of the subjunctive, conditional and result moods the 2nd sg. and the 1st p1.
have the same tone pattern.
The perfective and imperfective forms of the indicative mood are distinguished
tonally where the verbal stem belongs to tone class 3-2, but not in the case of CV
verbal stems belonging to other tone classes. Verbal stems of tone class 3-2 have
tone 3 in the perfective indicative, and tone 3-2 in the imperfective:

43CVCV stems belonging to tone class 23 do not correspond to any of the CV tone
classes, but the tone of verbal forms based on stems of tone class 23 is comparable
with that of forms based on stems of tone class 22, with the difference that the second
tone of stems of tone class 23 is tone 3. Compare for example:

based on CVCV stems require little comment. The main tone classes of CVCV
stems are readily correlated with the tone classes of CV stems, and the tone patterns
of all verbal forms based on CVCV stems can be inferred from the tone patterns of
the forms based on CV stems. CVCV stems of tone classes 22, 21, 3-23, 44 correlate
with CV stems of tone classes 2, 2-1, 3-2, 4 respectively.

COMPLEX SENTENCESComplex sentences of the type described here are commonly used for specific ques
tions:
d~ ne a dudaa?
what did he pound?, what was it he pounded?
2In this chapter some of the commoner types of complex sentence are described;
attention is here confined to sentences containing two clauses, since sentences con
taining more than two clauses are comparatively rare and the clauses within them
are all such as are found in two-clause sentences. In complex sentences containing
two clauses, one clause may be nominal and one verbal, or both may be verbal.
Nominal ClauseVerbal ClauseAn expression which occurs in object position in sentences like a bida Do ne ‘he
beat Do’ can occur initially, followed by particle no 4 or ne 4, and this nominal
clause is followed by an indicative mood clause without ne. The initial expression
in this type of complex sentence is strongly emphatic:
DO no a bida
14 22it is Do he beat2Do ne a bida
14222No is commonly realized as a vowel of the same quality as the preceding vowel, but
with tone 4; the sequence of two like vowels is heard as a long vowel:

going to school’ can occur initially in a clause with no:
suku no ne ml
4141it is to school that I am goingke suku no ne mldé
4141it is to school that I am going11An expression which normally occurs in adjunct position may occur initially in a
complex sentence of this type. A locative expression in the first clause is preceded
by ke 1 ‘there’, and -de ‘there’ occurs with the verbal stem in the second clause:

1. STATEMENTSSentences which occur as statements are divided into:
(a) Verbal sentences
(b) Nominal sentences
9899Verbal sentences
Verbal sentences are described in terms of the number of structural positions
distinguished for each type of sentence, of the relative order of these positions, and
of the kinds of words and phrases which occur in each. Sentences containing the
minimum number of structural positions are described first, followed by description
of sentences containing additional structural positions. Sentences of this latter kind
are said to be expansions of sentences containing the minimum number of positions,
but this is not intended to imply that they are derived from the latter; description
in terms of ‘expansion’ is merely a convenient way of handling together sentences
of different structural length. (Nominal sentences are described on p. 109).
It should be noticed that in any particular sentence, a single structural position
may be filled by several words; for example, the three-word phrase kê a yu ‘the
chief’s child’ occupies a single structural position in the sentence:
kë a yu miii
cf. DO mu~the chief’s child went today
Do went todayIn these two sentences, first position is filled by k~ a yu and DO respectively.n~ 2muna 22
muna 32he went before yesterday
he went before yesterdayne 1
m~ 1muna 12
muna 32I went before yesterday
I went before yesterdayIn moods other than the indicative, subject position can be filled only by a subject
pronoun. Compare for example:
Indicative Mood:
Indicative Mood:
Subjunctive Mood:Apposition
In all moods a pronoun in subject position can support a noun or nominal phrase
in apposition before subject position:
DO ba flu nc
cf. b~ flU ~EThe shortest structural type of simple sentence which occurs as a statement has
two positions; in the indicative mood, first position can be filled by a noun or nominal
phrase, singular or plural, or by a subject pronoun; second position can be filled by
a verbal stem, either unaffixed or with any combination of affixes ordered according
to the table on p. 58:
Position 2
mun
munao
muc100Position 2
muna 22
muna 32In the indicative mood this is not common except where the expression in apposition
before subject position is a phrase consisting of antecedent + relative clause. A

occur as second immediate constituent in phrases whose first immediate constituent
is a possessive pronoun, and also as third immediate constituent in genitival phrases

ADJECTIVES, DETERMINATIyEs, AND CONJUNCTIONSOnly one suffix occurs with post-nominal adjectives (other than verbal adjectives);
this is plural suffix {-i}. The realizations of stem-final vowel

"Clusters in which the second consonant is IThe spelling bk is an accurate representation of the pronunciation of this word
in quick speech, but in slow speech bk (and words like it) is pronounced as a disyl
labic word with intervocalic consonant:
bk ‘frog’ is pronounced bode in slow speech
fla ‘snatch’ is pronounced foda in slow speech.
Words like bk are therefore regarded as syncopated forms of CVCV words. But
there are a few words like ffi ‘flea’ in which consonant clusters occur even in slow

meltThe spelling kwa is an accurate representation of the pronunciation of this word
in quick speech, but in slow speech kwa is pronounced koa; likewise kwe ‘top’ is
pronounced koc. These words are therefore assigned to the CVV type.
There are, however, some words in which a consonant cluster occurs even in slow
speech. Most, if not all, of these are loanwords.
Vowel Harmony
There is in the language a system of vowel harmony, which operates within roots,
and also to some extent between stems and suffixes.
Very briefly, for descriptive purposes, it is possible to divide the vowels into three sets:UIe0C
ca~ÔVowels belonging to any one set are mutually compatible; so are A and C, and B
and C, but A and B are mutually exclusive.
Some examples of vowel harmony in words consisting of stem + suffix are:16A + A
C + Bbié

in nouns and verbs, although fairly common in ideophones.
It may be noted here that the intervals between the levels are not uniform. The
results of several hundred tonometer readings of the speech of one informant may
be summarised schematically:

are average figures, but the intervals were in fact found to be remarkably constant

4 ironyFrom these examples it will be seen that tone 3-1 contrasts with tone 2-1 and also
with tone 3-2.
The four tone levels postulated for monosyllabic words may be expected to give
16 tone patterns for disyllabic words, and all of these are found, except tone pattern
34; tone 42 has been found with only one word, gbama 42 ‘whether or not’. Only
a few words have been found with tone pattern 24, and all of these are loanwords
from English, such as mato 24 ‘motor vehicle’, mafia 24 ‘scarf’.
All the tonal contours found with CVCV words are found also with CVV words.
Further, the ‘tonal behaviour’ of CVV and CVCV words is identical. This may be
illustrated by the words doc 22 ‘elephant’ and noa 22 ‘ear’, which are tonally com
parable with yidê 22 ‘monkey’ and nyena 22 ‘blood’, in the two contexts:

stress, and most of the former occur with all three styles of pronunciation.
In both EP1 and EP2 the syllable bearing the strong stress is uttered with con
siderably greater force and tenseness than in UP, and (inter alia), its releasing con
sonant is noticeably lengthened; when the strong stress falls on the second syllable
there is (inter alia) a noticeable sharp division of the syllables:
UP
‘sono
sono
‘bide
‘minaThere is an important characteristic of Grebo speech which can conveniently be
called stress. Stress in Grebo is a complex of several phonetic features, some of
which are very difficult to describe precisely, but others, such as lengthening of con
sonants, are more readily described.
Two degrees of stress are here recognised, ‘strong’ (maximal) stress and ‘zero’
stress. Two other terms used in this description are ‘front-stressed’ and ‘backstressed’; an example of a front-stressed word is sono ‘sting’, and of a back-stressed
word, so’no ‘smell’. These two words are differentiated only by the place of the
strong stress.
In considering stress it is necessary to distinguish three styles of pronunciation:
Unemphatic Pronunciation (UP), Emphatic Pronunciation 1 (EPI), and Emphatic
Pronunciation 2 (EP2).
A word which is front-stressed in UP is front-stressed also in EP1, but is backstressed in EP2; likewise a word which is back-stressed in UP is back-stressed also

likewise sono ‘smell’ in EP1 and sono ‘sting’ in EP2.
As well as differing in respect of place of strong stress, EP1 and EP2 differ also
in usage:
EP1 is commonly used in repeating a word not understood or believed by the
listener, or in contradicting a former speaker.
EP2 is used to denote a referent which is in some way extraordinary and outside
normal experience, very often in regard to size:

The ‘stress behaviour’ of this type of word, it will be noticed, is exactly comparable
with that of words of the pae type, and this has been considered one of several reasons
for regarding the finals of such words as consisting of sequences of like vowels.
19CHAPTER 3Alternants -ho and -bfl are in free variation after i, 1, é, fi, u, fl; only -bo occurs after
other vowels.
e.g. Palibo, with free variant Palibô
Gédébo, with free variant GédébóAFFIX ALTERNANTSNyabo, without variant.
The language contains several groups of affixes, each of which consists of two or
more members which have the same meaning but different, though similar, shapes;
for example, -da and -na, which occur in sentences like ne duda bla ne ‘I pounded
rice’ (cf. du ‘pound’) and ne muna ne ‘I went’ (cf. mu ‘go’) respectively, and which
both have the meaning of past tense. Since -da and -na have the same meaning and
their distribution is phonologically determined (-da occurs after oral vowels, -na
after nasal vowels), they can be grouped together as alternants of one unit, which
may be written -da
-na. Suffix units of this type are listed below, with a statement
of their alternants and of the distribution of these; the sign —~ is placed between
alternants whose distribution is phonologically definable, and the sign ~ between
alternants whose distribution is not phonologically definable and for which it is
necessary to list the stems with which each alternant occurs.
Listed first are certain two-member suffix units of a rather trivial kind, which can
be described very briefly, and which call for little or no discussion. These are ar
ranged on the basis of phonological similarity in three groups:

"131TRANSLATIONS
1. GREBO MARRIAGE CUSTOMSLovemaking
It is well known that a man and a woman do not rush into marriage. They must
know each other first as lovers. However, lovemaking does not wait for maturity
and old age, hence children make love, just as adults do. When you see young love,
you think it more pleasant than adult love. When you are children, love begins on
the beach. At play, you smear your companion with mud, your companion hits
you with a lump of earth. This goes on for some time before you come to know
each other well. The two of you who are choosing each other imitate married life
there on the beach. When the time for playing hide and seek arrives, it is you two
who hide by yourselves. If you see a nut and break it, you eat part and put part
aside for your companion. At home, when your mother gives you food, you work
a handful of rice into a lump and look for your companion to give it to. If you come
into a crowd, nobody touches your companion without your coming to blows over
it. Nothing comes near this for sweetness and pleasantness. This is what we have
in mind when we say, ‘Kpoa says, “A child’s play is pleasant.”
So you go on gradually developing; thus love goes on and blossoms forth in
various ways. If you keep your eyes open, you begin to be able to act on your own
initiative. If you are coming from the farm, a stalk of sugar has to be long and fine
looking before you bring it for your companion. If you go fishing for tane, at the
stream you take away your lover’s tane
only the large ones. In the case of a girl
if you come from removing the water from a dam, the dish of fish and palm butter
has to be tasty before you await your friend with it.
If you are indulging in this adolescent behaviour then mothers’ and fathers’ eye
is on you. If this lovemaking is real love such as is going to lead to marriage, the
young man’s parents, after questioning him about his current love affair, go to the
girl’s parents with the words, ‘Our child wants your child; he is very fond of her.
So that is what we have come for, to see if you agree that our child should marry
her at some future time’. The girl’s parents discuss the matter and put the question,
‘Is this child of theirs fit to marry anyone’s child, and in particular is he suitable for
our child?’ If things look encouraging to the girl’s people, they bring back word,
‘We have no objection; we agree’. If the young man’s people feel that the discussion
about their child’s wife is encouraging, they bring a splinter or similar object and
insert it in the girl’s hair as a sign that ‘we have chosen this girl for our son, till she
—132is mature.’ Thus so long as the splinter is in the girl’s hair a suitor cannot have
anything whatever to do with her.
Courtship
At this point the seeking of a wife by youths and that by adults converge, for if
you are an adult and you see a woman who takes your fancy, and if you have finished
meeting each other, then your parents or you yourself take the road and go to her
people after her. If her people agree, but you are not ready, then you stick a splinter
in her hair. Sometimes it is not a real splinter, but because you have chosen her, it
is the same kind of betrothal. This finding of a wife and courting her is what we
Grebo call ‘courtship’. If the courtship is acceptable to them, the girl’s people bind
her tightly to the young man with the words, ‘It is you alone that we know; if any
thing untoward happens, then we hold you responsible.’ This means that if anything
happens to the girl, her people have the power to question the young man.
As I said before, nothing is as pleasant as a love affair. If two lovers truly love
each other, then they express themselves in various ways. Eyes, fingers and also
handkerchiefs are what they express themselves with. If you are saying something
to your friend among other people which you don’t want them to hear, you take a
handkerchief and tie knots in it and give it to your friend. The number of knots it
has or how they are tied, is what your friend notices, and so knows your mind and
replies to you. In this way your conversation is a secret confined to you alone. Some
times if you think that the crowd should not see the passing of a handkerchief, you
go to your friend and shake hands with her in a special way. How you shake hands
lets her know that you want to talk to her. She immediately slips quietly away from
the crowd so that you can talk to her privately.
Regarding the joys of lovemaking, a lover does not see his friend’s faults, he does
not hear any ill of her, he does not feel the pain of injuries she causes. Consequently
when your friend strikes you a hard blow you say, ‘Oh, it is nothing; the blows of a
suitor and a young woman do not hurt.’ From this we Grebo derive the saying, ‘The
blows of a woman and her suitor do not cause pain’. This means that if a lover strikes
his friend, it does not cause a quarrel; one does not even become in the least angry.
Giving a child a water enema
When a love affair is going well, you, the suitor, rush off to the young lady with
whatever comes into your hands. The various small things with which a suitor seeks
a wife are what we call courtship things. These things with which a young man
presses his suit persuade the girl’s people to be well disposed toward the young man.
If this suit finds favour in the eyes of the girl’s people, and if the young man still
perseveres, then the girl’s people release her, that means that it is time that she went
133to her lover for a while, so that they may come to know each other’s character; and
that they may get to know each other. Then the young woman goes to the young
man for some time. During the time that the young man and the girl live together
they learn how things are going to be when they are married. This is what we Grebo
call ‘giving a child a water enema.’ Then we say, ‘The girl has gone for a water
enema.’ It is during the time that the girl spends with the young man that each one
learns his companion’s character
whether you are kind or not, whether you are
jealous or not, whether you are open-handed or not, whether you thrash women
or not
all these things come to light; each sees his friend’s real nature. You two
people are confident that each will be able to put up with his companion’s behaviour;
then you make a pledge (that means an agreement that one will not let his friend
down), each binding himself. This ‘giving a child a water enema’ sometimes takes
a few months. When the time for your getting to know each other well comes to
an end, the girl’s people come for her and take her away so that she can tell them
what she thinks of the young man. The girl is with her people, and then the young
man follows her in order to test what has been said, and to see if she will go back
on her word. But if nothing further happens, he withdraws for the time being.
——Mother-in-law money
Because the discussion about the young man’s girl has gone well, he takes the
road. During this time, in the course of a certain visit which he makes, he takes
some money along with him. The amount is 12/-, which he must take to the girl’s
mother, or to the person acting in her stead, for her to use like the present of a boy
to his girl friend. This 12/- is what we call ‘mother-in-law money.’ This motherin-law money the woman’s mother, or the person acting in her stead, has on her
own account; she takes it and spends it in the normal way, on account of the hardship
she has borne in connection with her daughter.
W~fe and husband
When the young man has finished paying mother-in-law money, he goes for his
wife, and tells her that the time has come for her to enter matrimony. The girl’s
people pack up all her belongings, and take her and bring her to the young man
during the night. Before they take her to you, you give her whatever you have so
that she may start life with it. Others have to give her advice. If you give a person
something before she or he has a husband or wife, then we say ‘he has initiated her
into married life’, which means that he has introduced her to matrimony. If the
girl’s people manage to bring her in the evening, then along with the young man’s
people they arrange themselves in a group so that they can give their collective advice
to their children. When this has been done, they take the girl and hand her over to
134the young man with the words, ‘Here is your wife.’ Then they face the girl and say,
‘Here is your husband. Henceforward you are husband and wife.’ So the married
life of husband and wife begins at that point. Then the husband is male head of the
household, and the wife the female head. Relatives of the wife or husband come
to stay with them to give them some assistance in beginning married life.
If the marriage goes well, after some time the wife’s people come to the fore again,
and come to the husband with the words, ‘This marriage is highly satisfactory; we
have come for our child’s bridewealth.’ This bridewealth is sometimes two cows,
depending on the husband’s ability to pay. They do not kill these cows either for
food or for money. They put them out to graze so that they may breed. It is the
older male relatives of the woman who brings them in who have charge of them,
and who raise them. These cows will be in the pasture and will breed as wealth
belonging to the clan. Consequently if a clan has many daughters, it is rich in cattle
on the pasture. But again, if a boy belonging to this same clan sees a woman whom
he wants to marry, then it is from these same cattle when they breed that they take
and give as bridewealth for the boy’s wife. Thus the wealth brought in by the girls
is cattle which pass backwards and forwards. They come from one clan and go to
another. If life has gone against the fathers, the cattle given as bridewealth for their
daughters are on the pasture, and if they breed, they can take a bull and kill it or
settle a debt with it. But they keep the cows for the payment of bridewealth by the
children, and other important matters. Consequently if you have a daughter and
she has not yet found a husband, this worries you; if you are a girl yourself, your
words carry little weight in the family because you have never at any time brought
your parents money which they could boast about, or which constitutes wealth.
But when a daughter manages to bring in money which the relatives, both male and
female, spend, and other wealth which they put in the pasture, then this confers
prestige; the girl herself has a say in family affairs.
Each clan has an elder who advises on all occasions. He it is we call the clan elder.
In a family, it is with the clan elder that all discussions end. If you have a problem,
you take it to him so that he may consider it wisely. The husband’s and the wife’s
disputes go to him for his decision; he finds one guilty, the other innocent
the
disputes are ended.
If the husband is self-reliant, and he sees another woman whom he wants to marry,
then he seeks her as he did in the case of the first wife. If he is successful, he marries
her, and that makes two wives; sometimes there are three, four, five according to
his ability. The first wife he marries is the one we call the head wife; the last wife
we call the junior wife, because very often she is a youngster among her companions.
The head wife gives instructions to her co-wives; it is to her that they look for the
running of the house, because she is the most senior of the wives. If one’s comrade
—135does something wrong, she it is who must settle the quarrel before it gets to the
husband. She must always conceal the unsavory conduct of her co-wives. Then
they like her and give her great respect. If married women love each other, they
work for the head wife and she does not touch a thing; she just gives directions to
others and her work is done for her. If a married woman addresses her comrade, she
says, bae nodo nyen~, which means ‘female comrade who is married to the same
husband as myself’. If two, three, four women marry the same man, then we say
they are married to one man, because all of them are under the authority of the same
person or of the same clan. It is the junior wife whom the husband often takes to
places as his carrier and personal attendant. At home, it is she whom the husband
calls and sends to places, and she always waits upon him. The most junior wife is
the husband’s choice for many reasons, such as; her and her husband’s love is still
fresh; that she may learn about the husband and not fear him; she is not familiar
with her comrades, therefore the husband should advise her; sometimes, if she has
not been married before, that she should watch her comrades and observe what
married life is. As a result, if you want to soften the husband’s heart, you go through
the junior wife, who may soothe the husband’s anger for you. So sometimes the hus
band’s enemies seek an opportunity to go through the junior wife and do him harm.
Therefore the husband must keep a sharp eye on his youngest wife’s behaviour.
If the husband marries many women, he builds them, if he can, houses which they
own individually. Sometimes he builds a long house, which he divides up for them,
and they divide it into apartments. Each wife has her own hearth, which must burn
all the time. Therefore the husband must be a man of some standing before he
marries several wives. If a wife has initiative, she helps the husband by doing farm
work which brings food, and sometimes work from which she obtains money with
which to buy clothes, without her husband’s knowledge. All women married to one
husband must feed him individually as if he had married one of them, who would
have done so. Each wife must have crockery in which she can put his food. Con
sequently when a meal time arrives, the husband sits down and his wives surround
him with food. He will take portions of all this food on to one plate to eat, because
if he did not do so, the wife whose food he did not eat would be angry, and say that
her husband did not love her, and so did not eat the food she had prepared. This
is an embarrassment to husbands, and so it comes about that some of them kill
themselves with food in order that a particular woman may not take offence at them.
There are two evils in this practice. Firstly, it keeps the husband constantly on the
alert; secondly, it wastes food. Consequently some husbands do not do it at all.
There are several alternative arrangements. Some combine and cook a single large
potful; others divide the cooking by days. The wife whose turn it is to do the cooking
cooks for the husband that day. The wives of one man show their love for each otherif, when the husband’s share has come out, they combine all their cooking pots and
eat out of a single dish. When they have finished, they form a circle for conversation,
and while some of them pick each other’s hair, others plait hair. This is what we call
domestic bliss; it confers prestige on the husband, and gives him a great reputation
and respect in the family.
If the husband marries several women, when he is clearing a farm he embraces
a wide area, which will make it possible for all his wives to have a share. Rice is the
staple food of us Grebo, hence every year we must grow rice. When a husband is
able to clear a big farm, he divides it into sections which he distributes among his
wives, and they make boundaries by which the plots are recognised. Each wife looks
after her own section. They hire people and do jointly the hard part of the work
before each woman who has her own plot turns to it. Thus we recognise the lazy
woman and the diligent.
It is a well known fact that married life is not always agreeable; it goes along
smoothly, and then a sudden change occurs and the husband and wife say nasty
things to each other. Sometimes it ends in a quarrel, and there is bad feeling between
them. What I have described shows that married life for us Grebo requires careful
handling, because when two or three women are gathered together anywhere there
is always quarrelling between them. But the position is much worse when they are
married to the same husband.
If a husband and wife have a disagreement, they try to patch it up peacefully
within the family so that it is settled. But when it comes to a particularly bad quarrel
such as ends in blows, they sometimes clash (of course we know that a woman has
a tongue, not fists), then the woman runs away and goes to her people. Sometimes
she takes her complaint to the husband’s people. Quite often before she goes far
she finds the clan elder and lodges a complaint. The elder comes and settles it pri
vately, and married life resumes its course. But if the woman bypasses the elder
and goes to her people, then it is more difficult for the husband, because he must
take the road and go after his wife. It is rare, when the wife goes to her people in a
temper, for them to take her back to her husband at once. If a man is having trouble
with his wife, he must take the road and follow in her tracks wherever she goes. A
good husband puts up with the distasteful aspects of the relation between himself
and his wife because he does not want bad reports about his wife, or their domestic
affairs, to be broadcast in an unseemly manner.
If the quarrel between husband and wife concerns the committing of adultery,
then the discussion of it goes on until it ends in court, if the husband says that he
cannot cover it up. Then all the unsavory facts come out. A quarrel of this sort
belongs to the chief’s court, where the law of the land is assembled, and judges
discuss the complaints. There are different kinds of laws which apply to different
137136kinds of cases. If a senior wife (who is head of all the wives) commits adultery the
law relevant to this is different from, and more severe than, the law relevant to the
other wives of the same husband. A young man who is proceeded against never
ceases to regret it. The law gives to a husband power to do as he thinks fit with the
young man
short of taking his life. Hence if one of the wicked ones catches the
young man in a corner, he thrashes him until he half kills him. That is the end of
the matter, because he has had satisfaction, and so it does not go to court.
If a woman has had money given for her, the clan whose member marries her have
charge of her. Hence if her husband dies, she is not allowed to go back to her own
people, unless her husband’s clan who have charge of her give permission. Therefore
when a married man dies, his wives and senior relatives assemble in the same house
and mourn him. When the fourth day arrives, all the wives of the same husband
must shave their heads on account of their late husband. The relative of any woman
who does not want to shave her head then comes forward with money, saying, ‘I
don’t want this relative of mine to shave, so I have bought the hair of her head.’
Those wives whose relatives come forward are all alike in that they do not shave
their heads. When the husband’s funeral celebrations are over, his clan assemble
and call his widows. When they have assembled, the clan address the widows, ‘Your
husband is dead, therefore let each look among us, the clan males, and let her choose
a new husband whom she likes.’ These women then begin to choose husbands; in
the case of each woman, the man her eyes rest on is the one she names, even though
he is young. Some choose children, for whose maturity they have to wait. Those
who choose adults are going to embark on a new married life at once. This shows
that the married women of a clan are tied to the family. If a woman’s husband dies
and she says that she does not want to remarry, the clan allow her to live in the
family and to look after herself, under their authority. She must be under the au
thority of the clan because their money is still on her. Sometimes it is a child under
marriageable age whom she names, and the result of this is that she does not live
as a married woman.
When a husband dies, his belongings do not go to his wives; they come into the
hands of the clan, who allocate them. If he leaves sons alive who are of age, then
it is they and the clan who share the belongings.
When a woman says that she does not want her husband on account of another
man, if she has money on her, the new person she wants must redeem her before
he can marry her. This means that the new person must seek and pay the money
to her husband. It is this money that her people will take to pay back her former
husband’s money. If this does not happen, then the former husband still has authority
over his wife. A woman cannot marry a new husband while the former husband’s
money is on her.
—138If a man does not seek the woman from her people and does not pay bridewealth
for her, or even does not come forward openly, and if they have a child, then the
woman’s people have power to claim this child as theirs. They hold this child as
long as its father will not come forward. But if the father is concerned for the child,
then he brings money and a petition to the woman’s people, and they hold a meeting.
If the woman’s people are satisfied on all counts,
because sometimes the father
must recompense them for the hardship that they endured in rearing the child
then they release the child, and its father takes it. A child of this kind is what we
call a love child. Many of them are lost to their father’s clan as they have no fathers,
but the woman’s clan look after them as their children.
——The ending or break up of a marriage
Apart from death, a marriage can end in two ways. Firstly, if a husband says
that he no longer likes being married to his wife, he packs a good box of clothes for
her; he gathers all her things and packs them. The husband goes to the woman’s
people with the words, ‘Your child whom I took as a bride
her marriage to me
is dissolved. Therefore I shall bring her back to you.’ Then the husband sends
people with the woman who take her to her people. If the woman’s people are fond
of her, they bring her before them and question her. If it is possible, they take an
axe (which is a petition) to the husband. But if the husband is determined, they
withdraw and accept their child willingly. This dignifies the husband more than if,
because he did not want her, he foolishly beat her and pushed her out, and she went
to her people by herself. Secondly, if the wife says that she does not want to remain
married to her husband, she constantly looks for a pretext. Consequently if her
husband does the slightest thing to her, she rushes off to her people. There she will
be for the husband to visit until he gets tired; sometimes until he gets annoyed and
leaves her altogether. Then she remains for good. By death or by either of these
two ways a marriage breaks up. If after consideration a husband sees that his mar
riage cannot be mended, he goes to his wife’s people for the money which he expended
on their child. This money does not mean the mother-in-law money, because the
wife’s mother, or the person acting in her place, spent it as the mother-in-law. But
the cows which he paid to the senior male relatives, these it is they must give him
back
this does not mean that it is the same cows that he gave that they must
return; it may be their offspring, or quite different cattle. That his cattle should be
numerically correct is the important thing. When they give him his cattle, it is then
completely finished between him and his wife. His clan has no longer any power
over this woman. In a nutshell, the woman is free to do whatever she wants. If her
people are not able to provide the husband’s cattle, then the husband still has power
to keep an eye on her whenever he sees her.
——139If husband and wife have children, and these are fairly old, then, when the parents
separate, they go to the father. But if they are very young, such as the husband
cannot look after, then the wife takes them and the father supports them in her
custody till they grow up. When they grow up, the father goes for them and takes
them to his home. But because children are the flesh of both mother and father, the
father cannot prohibit their going to their mother. Therefore although the mother
is married to another man, her former husband’s children are constantly going to
her. If a husband loves his wife and they have children, although they have separated,
yet on account of the children and their love, the wife still receives things secretly
from the former husband. Sometimes in this way they come to marry each other
again.
2. THE ORIGIN OF THE GREBOWhere the Grebo came from before they called themselves Grebo is what I wish
to discuss briefly.
The name ‘Grebo’ is of recent origin. At one time the people we now call Grebo
lived in the land of the Kran, far inland in the country we call Bedoye. At this time
they called themselves Gbobo
a name some Kran still call themselves at the
present day.
Things went well for some time, then the rumour spread, ‘You don’t know it, but
some of the Kran strangers are tapping palm trees in the land of us Gbobo.’ This
brought a misunderstanding between them and the Kran. Eventually it brought
war between these two peoples. This quarrel over the tapping of palm trees caused
the Gbobo and the Kran to fight two wars. The Gbobo considered the situation
and then they said, ‘Well, “Knee, help me,” let us flee from this land before we are
destroyed, because it is not they alone who are fighting us. Another people has
joined them, so we cannot withstand them.’ And so the Gbobo fled.
The Gbobo were unanimous; they packed everything up and ran away quickly.
They walked and walked for a whole year before they reached the people called
the Muniewe in French territory, in the neighbourhood of Béréby. The Muniewe
received these strangers peacefully. The strangers themselves put down their loads,
with the intention of settling. So the Gbobo lived with the Muniewe for some time.
But it was not long before friction arose between the Muniewe and their guests.
‘Goodness, comrades, what is the matter now? If it is the case that “a long journey
does not cause pus,” let us move on again. See to it, citizens, that intelligence of this
does not become known to the Muniewe.’
The Gbobo considered this proposal very carefully, and then said, ‘Citizens, let
us hold a secret meeting; let us not leave precipitately.’ Then they fixed a time that
‘on this day, if you are a man, get hold of your canoe. We shall go on an island so
—140that we may discuss these secret matters.’ When the day that they had appointed
arrived, all the men quietly left the town and went on to a big expanse of rock beside
the sea to hold a secret discussion because they did not want the Muniewe
and
even the women and children
to get an inkling of what was being discussed.
On this big stretch of rock they decided that, ‘We ought to leave this land; if this
is not done, then it will not go well with us in the future. Do not let this discussion
be known to the women.’ They grunted their reply. Then they dispersed, came to
town and went into their houses. Soon afterwards a fool who lived among them
distinguished himself. He seemed to think that he was the only man in the world
who had a wife whom he loved. This fool’s name was Gbaa. He suddenly turned
to his wife, who was called Yia, with the words, ‘My wife, I love you dearly, so I
must tell you what secrets we discussed on the big stretch of rock, whatever the out
come may be, because I am your god.’ And so Gbaa told Yia all that had been dis
cussed in secret. This delighted Yia; ‘Ah,’ she thought, ‘my husband really loves
me, for him to give me an inkling of these important matters that have been discussed.’
When day dawned, Yia took a water pot and went for water. At the well she saw
her woman friend and said to her, ‘Look, dear, my husband loves me well, and does
not hide anything from me. Do you know that our menfolk went on the big stretch
of rock beside the sea and held a secret discussion about our leaving this country?’
This friend of hers said no. Then Yia said, ‘Well, listen, let me tell you something;
we are going to leave this country soon
something you have not heard about.’
Then this woman was heart-broken; ‘Oh, mother,’ she said, ‘does my husband really
not love me? Well, it is between him and me now.’
Then this jealous woman became worked up; she set about finding her husband.
She found him among the Muniewe
surely one ought to call him aside. She made
no attempt whatever at concealment; right there among the Muniewe she delivered
a tirade against her husband. In the course of this the Muniewe heard all the secrets
of the Gbobo. Probably they organised themselves for keeping watch on the Gbobo.
Nevertheless the Gbobo were not discouraged. They held a secret discussion for
the second time. There a Yidabo youth called Pudi Nimle (he was a hunter) made
the observation, ‘Look, while out hunting I have seen a piece of land, admittedly
it is a long way from here, but it will do well as a dwelling place. Therefore we ought
to go there.’ Then they grunted their approval, and replied that they should leave
the land of the Muniewe at once. They fixed a definite day and said, ‘When this day
comes, watch day and night
fathers, mothers, children included
all of us shall
follow Pudi Nimle to this new land. Comrades, we beg you that no one divulge this,
especially those of you who have wives you love well and whom you worship as
goddesses.’
Pudi Nimle told them, ‘To get there quickly, we must go by sea.’ When the ap
——————141pointed day arrived, another matter cropped up
‘How are we to go, since we have
no canoes?’ Then they decided that they must seize the canoes lying on the beach,
which belonged to the Muniewe, since they would be asleep. So the Gbobo seized
the canoes of the Muniewe. During this flight, before they could be launched, some
of the canoes which were heavily laden began to capsize. This carried off many lives.
Some people who were unable to launch remained ashore. Even some of those who
had succeeded in launching became very angry and went back again. The people
who could not withstand the waves went back; when they had landed, they went
inland a short distance and settled. It is these people whom we call Wodebo
that
means the people who have capsized.
The Gbobo who persevered paddled for a long time, and struggled for long against
the waves before they eventually came ashore. They found a ship at anchor where
they landed. The name of the captain of this ship was Bostman. They were not
concerned with the question of the ship’s nationality, but what they did know was
that the people aboard the ship were engaged in slave trading.
This new land was not uninhabited. The Gbobo found two different peoples, the
Kru and the Blewe
the present day Baabo. These two peoples lived on the coast
as fishermen. After the Gbobo succeeded in landing, it was no time before bad
feeling arose between them and the Kru, which eventually brought war between the
Gbobo and the Kru. In this war which they fought, the Gbobo defeated the Kru.
So the Kru fled; they scattered in all directions into the bush. They went some
distance, and then regrouped before they went further west, where they live to this
day; they call themselves various names.
Those of the Gbobo who stayed behind in the land of the Muniewe were there for
some time, then they set off and followed their comrades. But when they caught up
with them, they bypassed them and went by the coast route. They pressed on till
they caine to the vicinity of the Kru, who ran away, and then they settled down.
These are the people we call Sekedewe, which means the people who stayed behind.
When the Gbobo had succeeded in driving the Kru from the land, the Baabo went
their own way, and the Gbobo were left by themselves. At this point a man called
Sie Nmable Gyide (he belonged to the Wodeabo section) raised another matter,
‘Comrades,’ he said, ‘I want to establish a town.’ His fellow countrymen agreed
to this, and they endorsed what he had said with the words, ‘Ah, that is a good idea,
because the place you have in mind is on the sea coast, so we can keep a look out to
sea for enemies.’
On this matter the Gbobo were divided, and a few of them joined Sie Nmable
Gyide and went and founded the town we call Taa at the present day. Of those who
stayed behind the elder was Dudi Poo.
While they were engaged in establishing this new town, the Muniewe raided them,
———142on account of their canoes, because when the Gbobo were leaving the land of the
Muniewe they seized all their good canoes. The name of the leader of the Muniewe
who brought them was Sede Kwa; they were extremely strong. The Gbobo took
one good look at them, and fled in the direction of the Weabo (whom we call Yoabo
at the present day). At this time the Yoabo were some small distance from the sea.
The Gbobo lived in Yoabo territory for two years and four months.
Before they returned they consulted a medicine-man about their future. The
medicine-man told them, ‘The medicine I am going to give you is in the water, and
a wreath of thorns is on top of it. It is into this wreath of thorns that anyone must
jump before he can get this medicine.’ Then they became afraid. Soon afterwards
a hero appeared among them. But there was more to it than meets the eye. A Glebo
youth called Nyema Kewe, of incomparable handsomeness
it was on account
of love for him that medicine-man Peewe’s wife became very agitated. We are told
that this Glebo youth’s eyebrows and hair were like the hair of a horse in smoothness.
When you see them, you exclaim, ‘Oh, his eyes!’; they were like a halo round the
sun. This completely infatuated the wife of Peewe the medicine-man, and she said
to Nyema Kewe, ‘Handsome youth, I love you very much; I can no longer conceal
it. Look, the wreath of thorns that my husband has told you about is not in the
water at all. It hangs on a tree. It is its shadow which is in the water, and which
rests on the medicine. Therefore when you go, I want you to volunteer. Have no
fear. Take courage and jump into the water so that you may take the medicine and
win a great reputation as a consequence.’ Then the handsome youth agreed.
When the Gbobo went for the medicine, Nyema Kewe (the girl had given him
a hint) went to watch so that he might verify what the young woman had said. He
looked about to see that he was not observed, and then he went behind a tree. When
he saw that the young woman had not told him a lie, he came forward; he struck
his chest, saying, ‘I shall dive into the water, regardless of the consequences.’ Then
the Gbobo shook their rattles for him. The warrior dived cleanly into the water.
When he had taken the medicine, they shouted, but he immediately became possessed
by a spirit and dashed off. They followed him; when he had climbed the big rock
we call Taa Hwe Lu, at once the spirit slowly came out of him. He put the medicine
down and placed a bundle of leaves on it. This medicine is at Taa at the present day;
this is the foundation of all us Grebo. We shall discuss this matter later. Thus the
Gbobo built Taa on a rock. This medicine has made this town sacrosanct, hence
war cannot destroy it.
When the building of Taa had made some progress, the Gbobo appointed elders
from the different clans in connection with the building of this, their first town. These
clan elders went and built the first town the Gbobo had had since leaving the land of
the Muniewe. When they had finished building it, their hero Nyema Kewe, said,
—143‘We ought to name this town after Pudi Nimle, because he brought us to this land.’
He had scarcely finished speaking when one, Gyoo Wea, immediately took up the
point, saying, ‘If there have been no mistakes so far, let there be none now. We
ought not to name this town after Pudi Nimle
and why?
he is just a hunter;
he does not own this land, consequently his name should not be attached to it.’ This
brought about a long discussion. When it had died down a little, they turned to
Gyoo Wea with the words, ‘As you have said, “The doctor who sees an illness cures
it,” therefore you will name it.’ At this point Gyoo Wea entered the discussion and
said, ‘I am going to name it wisely. We ought to call it Gbenogbenolu, because the
elders of the various clans who have assembled from all directions have built it.’
Then they grunted in agreement. This discussion Dudi Poo, who had authority over
all of them as elder, confirmed in the following terms, ‘Gyoo Wea, your words have
been most effective. In that case, you ought to suggest a name to us so you can get
rid of this Gbobo name.’ At once Gyoo Wea took up the point, ‘Indeed,’ he said,
‘I shall free you from the Gbobo name. Let it be recalled that when we were leaving
the land of the Muniewe several canoes capsized; there was heavy loss of life; some
people went back, some remained ashore without having launched at all. Those
companions of ours who intended to follow us passed us, others went up country
beyond us, some went in the direction of the Kru. It is well known that the people
who launched and then capsized went back and penetrated inland and are now living
inland from us. The name of these shall be ‘Wodebo’, because they capsized and
then came back. And those who remained behind did not launch at all, but remained
there and came to look for us, but they passed us and went toward the Kru area;
their name shall be ‘Sekedewe’ because when we were leaving the town of the Mu
niewe they remained behind; they did not attempt a launching at all.
‘Comrades, what about ourselves? We ought to bear in mind what we have been
through when we are giving ourselves a name. Our name should be ‘Gedebeo’,
because on our way here we mounted the waves just as the gede monkey climbs
trees.’ Immediately they sounded their rattles in support of him, and the resulting
uproar rose to the heavens.
When it had subsided they appointed people, telling them, ‘Go to Taa and tell
our comrades there, so that they may know about these new names.’ When this
news reached Taa, the inhabitants were very pleased with it. They gave it an en
thusiastic reception, and praised Gyoo Wea and their parent group. And they ap
proved these names also.
At this time the inhabitants of Taa said, ‘Well, if that is how it is, then we should
see that our medicine, which we have brought with us, is given a name too.’ So they
agreed on a name for their medicine; they called it Tegletegle a Hnabla. So it re
mained for a time, then they shortened the name and called it Tetegle a Hnabla.
—144—This name has come down to us, and we call it Glehnabla at the present day.
The name GédébéO which Gyoo Wea gave to the Gbobo, if we look into it, means
several things. The word glè is the name of a species of monkey that jumps a great
deal. That is why, if you climb a tree like this monkey, we say, ‘He climbs like glé,’
or especially if you grasp the tree with your feet and hands without your chest touch
ing it when climbing, that is what we call climbing like glé. Be means to knock
something gently against something else. When joined to glé it denotes how glé
puts its hands and feet on the tree in climbing or descending. When we are discussing
our name, we exclude the climbing part. We say Glébé or Glébo, not Glébé~ or
Glébéô. G1èbé~ means ‘climber’, Glébéô means ‘climbers’. But Glébé means one
individual of the Gbobo people, Glébo means several Gbobo.
Thus the Gbobo lost their Gbobo name, because at the present time we who are
their children’s children’s children’s..., when we call ourselves we say Glébo up to
the present day. Actually this name is Gédébo, but when we are talking we say Glébo,
because of the sluggish movement of the tongue.
Nevertheless the people whose land we originally came from and whose name we
took with us still call themselves Gbobo. Some of the ancient customs and crafts
which were there when we left are still alive up to the present day. Some of the
various peoples round us call us Gbobo. Those who have come to live with us and
others who have left us have languages related to ours, and all of us are Grebo.","[65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72]"

see p. 41.
69 gyeda habié: lit. ‘break a splinter’, hence ‘make an agreement, pledge’. Two
people who make an agreement take a splinter of wood, each person holding
one end; they then break this, and each of them keeps part.
69 ijwi ye leda: ‘a tying up of words’, i.e. ‘an argument’; ye leda is a verbal noun
phrase from la ye ‘tie’.
——148p70 nya na hao
lé ne: ‘that a person will not take away his foot from behind his
friend’, i.e. ‘that he will not let his friend down’; na hao ne is subjunctive mood
negative of hao, with particle lie (see p. 73).
71 ha yiyidôde na: 2nd p1. subjunctive mood; yiyidôde na is a derivative verb with
reciprocal meaning derived from yidô na ‘see clearly’.
72 die yidôe: verbal noun phrase from yidô na ‘see clearly’; time yu a die yidôe
(lit. ‘the seeing clearly of the young man’) is object of a nu ‘she has done’;
time yu a die yidOe is a genitival phrase, whose IC’s are time yu ‘young man’,
a ‘genitival link’, and die yidôc ‘seeing clearly’.
74 be yb tu: 3rd sg. perfective conditional mood negative of tuô, which consists
of ft + -ô ‘there’; notice that -ô occurs with the auxiliary verb, not with the
main verb.
75 da wudi: ‘mother-in-law money’. A suitor gives his prospective mother-in-law
12/- for her own use. This is quite distinct from the bridewealth, which is
paid later and in cattle. In the event of a subsequent divorce, the bridewealth
must be repaid, but the 12/- is regarded as a personal gift, and is not returned.
78 ba yl nil: 3rd sg. imperfective conditional mood of mu ‘go’; ml is the secondary
stem of mu; muc te ‘a certain going’ is in object position before ml ‘going’
‘if he is going a certain going’, i.e. ‘during a certain visit he makes’.
79 sédé: ‘shilling’. It may be noticed that this sum is given in shillings, although
the official currency of Liberia is no longer sterling.
79 yiba dc: lit. ‘face thing’, i.e. anything that a woman receives as a present, usually
from a lover.
81 na ka ne: ‘she has it’; na is 3rd sg. emphatic pronoun. The 3rd p1. object pro
noun ne which occurs here is not to be confused with the particle flC which
commonly occurs with the indicative mood; this latter is impossible here
since it does not occur in a sentence in which an emphatic pronoun is in sub
ject position.
81 koco
a sö~ a yb a taa: ‘on account of her daughter’s hardship she has seen’.
The first a is a 3rd sg. possessive pronoun referring to the daughter, the second
is a 3rd sg. subject pronoun referring to the mother.
The 12/- present is given by the young man as some compensation to his
mother-in-law for the trouble she has had in bringing up her daughter.
sO~: verbal noun from söã ‘suffer’.
83 kadé, kabuô: lit. ‘house mother, house father’. These two compounds have
as their first IC ka, which occurs only in compounds; elsewhere kae ‘house’
occurs. A few other words have a special compounding form, e.g. to ‘war’,
which has the compounding form ta.
It should be noticed that in phrases like kadé ka kabuô he the expression
denoting the female comes first, in contrast with the usual English order
‘husband and wife’. Compare also nyene ka nyebea he ‘wife and husband’
in line 92.
86 a ml tudi: ‘that she may begin life with it’; optative mood of tudi, instrumental
verb derived from ft.
92 kee: contraction of ke ne ‘thus it is, there it is’.
92 tifdc: tie + -dc ‘here’; tie is a causative/passive derivative verb derived from
hi; cf. hi hudu ‘begin’.

1. GED~BO A BLE TI TE3 o ne ijmona: ‘they do not jump up’; 3rd p1. imperfective indicative mood neg
ative of ijmona. The imperfective aspect is used for habitual action, and is
common throughout this text.
3 o ne dudide: ‘they do not marry each other’; 3rd p1. imperfective indicative mood
negative of dudide, a derivative verb with reciprocal meaning derived from
du ‘marry’. The reciprocal form consists of CV- + verbal stem + -de, and
hence dudude might have been expected here, but in speech the second vowel
is replaced by a front vowel.
4 kü~: ‘maturity’; verbal noun from kü ‘grow’.
4 kpoc: ‘old age’; verbal noun from kpe ‘be old’; see p. 24.

-ô ‘there’; ti is the secondary stem of tu ‘put’.
6 a yl sono ill: ‘while you are playing’; 2nd p1. imperfective indicative mood of
nu ‘do’; Iii is the secondary stem of flu.
7 ne hli: ‘you smear’; hli ‘smear’ is followed by two objects, the first denoting
what is smeared, the second what it is smeared with.
7 yibôédé: yibôé is a causative passive derivative verb from yibô ‘know’.
8 heede: ‘are choosing each other’; derivative verb with reciprocal meaning
derived from hede, the secondary stem of hade ‘choose’. The reciprocal form
consists of CV- + hede, and hehede would therefore have been expected; it
seems likely that this form had occurred at an earlier stage of the language,
but that the second h has been lost.

the secondary stem of p3 ‘seek’.

As will be seen from the above lists of pronouns, each series has two 3rd sg. pro

usage between the members of these pairs, statements about pronouns a and c are
valid for all pronouns with vowels a and ~ respectively; likewise for the plural pro
nouns o and e.
In very general terms, a may be said to be used of large, important or valuable
things, including human beings, and ~ of small, unimportant or worthless things.
Many nouns are referred to by both~ and s. A word denoting a part of the body,
for example, is referred to by~ when the part of the body in question is that of a
human being or of a large animal like a sheep, goat, leopard or horse, but by ~ when

"‘Until’‘Until’ clauses are of two kinds:
1. Those which do not imply whether or not they refer to an event that has
actually happened. Clauses with future time reference belong to this group, though
the group also includes clauses with past time reference.
The subjunctive mood is used in clauses of this kind; the same tense occurs in
both clauses. Subjunctive mood forms with auxiliary te are preferred; these are
confined to occurrence in clauses of this kind. The forms of the subjunctive mood
phrases with auxiliary te are set out below for tense 1 of di 2 ‘come’:

It should be noticed that many conditional mood clauses which have future time
reference or timeless habitual meaning are more appropriately translated in English
by a ‘when’ clause than by an ‘if’ clause. In sentences of this kind, the main clause
is commonly introduced by ne 1 ‘then’:232232232nedede be te di

time reference only.

"1966PREFACE© Copyright 1966 by Gordon InnesIt is hoped that this short Introduction to Grebo may be useful not only to those
who wish to acquire some practical knowledge of the language but also to scholars
working in the field of West African languages. The latter will be aware of how
little is at present known about the Kru languages, and I hope that they will find
this book is some contribution, however small, to our knowledge of one of these.
The book is divided into two parts, the first of which contains a grammatical
outline of the language, and the second of which contains two Grebo texts, together
with translation and annotation. The two Grebo texts are the work of Mr. 3. Y.
Dennis, who was a Research Assistant at the School for the two sessions 1955-1957.
The grammatical description presented here is based entirely on Mr. Dennis’s speech.
I wish to express my thanks to those of my colleagues who read the manuscript
in whole or in part and to whom I am indebted for many valuable suggestions; the
many discussions which I had with them of problems which arose during the writing
of this book were an immense and continuing help to me. My thanks are due also
to Miss Joan Oliver for assistance and much useful advice during the preparation
of the manuscript for publication.
Finally, I am grateful to the School of Oriental and African Studies for a total
subvention which has made publication possible.

something is given comes first:

"Object position
Do went before yesterday
Do went before yesterdayAs already described, the shortest structural type of verbal sentence which occurs
as a statement has two positions; slightly expanded sentences which have three
101structural positions are extremely common. Third position, which occurs after
second position of the minimum sentence type, will be called object position and an
expression in object position will be called the object of the sentence. Particle ne
(see p. 104), which commonly occurs in affirmative indicative mood sentences of
tenses 1-4, occurs immediately after object position.
Object position may be filled by:
1.
2.
3.gyé

"In phrases where the noun has lexical tone 1, 2-1, 3-2, 4:The noun has its lexical tone.
1st sg. pronoun has tone 2 before nouns with lexical tone I and 2-1, and tone 1
before nouns with lexical tone 3-2, 4. (For the tones of the other pronouns, seep. 51):

~ nen~,mine

The difference in usage between the members of the singular pair nen~ and nenc,
and between the members of the plural pair neno and acne is exactly comparable
with the difference between the members of the pronominal pairs ~ and c, and o
and e respectively (see p. 52).
In phrases whose second IC is nen~/nenc, the 1st and 2nd singular pronouns may
be omitted, and person is then marked by the tone of nen~/neng only:
nanen~221
nena 21
~nanen~ 3 33 1
mine
nen~ 33
yours
After all possessive pronouns other than na 2 ‘my’, nen~, nenc and neno, nene have
tone 33.
(b)Jdiii 33In Grebo literature the possessive pronoun and diii are written joined, and this
well established practice will be followed here:
nadfii 133
nadiii 333
~diii, cdiii 133myself
adii 333
yourself
adiii 133
himself, herself~ itself
odili, cdiii 133
e.g. ~ gada ~diii ne he consoled himself.ourselves

92(it is) I myself
I myself (have done it)
he himself (came)

cf. ba lelade

cf. be mu London

75For the difference in meaning between na be mu London flu ftc in (c) and be mu
London nu ftc in (a), see below.
A subjunctive phrase which occurs in those positions in which nouns occur is
regarded as a single syntactical unit; such a unit will be called a holophrastic sub
junctive.
A holophrastic subjunctive commonly occurs where the use of a verbal noun
would involve a sequence of two possessive pronouns:butbutna Ida
c lela

its killing; killing it
my killing it
‘my killing it’ is also possible; see below.na suku muc

my going to his school
‘my going to his school’ is also possible.","[37, 38]"
"Noun/pronounNumeralIn phrases of this type the order is noun/pronoun + numeral. Dfl ‘one’ occurs
with singular nouns, all other numerals with plural nouns. Both the noun and the
numeral have their lexical tones:
kaedO 14 3
kias3 14 2-1
besS 2-1 2-1one house
two houses
two tailsDo ‘one’ also occurs with emphatic pronouns m~ 1 ‘I’ and m~ 3 ‘you’, and with the
3rd sg. possessive pronouns ~ and c:
dO (no)kae lé
kia lé
mo léIn phrases consisting of noun
postposition, both the noun and the postposition
have their lexical tones, except:
(a) where the noun has final lexical tone 2-1, and the postposition has lexical
tone 2 or 2-1; then the tone patterns of the phrases are 2 1 and 2 2-1 respectively;
(b) where the noun has final lexical tone 4 and the postposition has lexical tone
2; then the pattern of the phrase is 4 3.
3.(a)a hmu
we five
o hmu
they five.
Also to be noted in this section are phrases whose 2nd Ic is tie ‘half, part, (in specific
questions) how much?, how many?’. Tie occurs as 2nd IC in phrases whose 1st IC
is a noun, singular or plural, or a possessive pronoun:

junctive mood phrases are found in positions in a sentence in which nouns and noun
phrases occur:ba Ia ne ya blidiour killing it has brought troublecf. ba la nelet us kill it32-14232-1I am pounding it (at this moment)

-3, alternant -3 consists of the substitution of tone 3 for
the final tone of the verbal stem:
—,Alternants -ô and -dé occur with stems which have final 1, 1, é, ô, u, ii; alternants
-o and -de occur with stems ending in other vowels.‘one individual’-~yeda 22‘~washyeda 23The distribution of the three alternants of suffix unit -da 3act of washing.
~‘-na 3-3 is as follows:21-3 occurs with CV(C)V stems whose final vowel is a/a and which has a tone higher
than tone 3, and also with one or two stems like heds 32 ‘read’.
-da and -na occur with all other stems, -da with those which have a final oral vowel,
and -na with those which have a final nasal vowel.
Suffix unit -da 3
-na 3
-3 does not occur with stems which have tone 21 or final
tone 2-1.
Alternants -da 3 and -na 3 always have tone 3. Alternants -da 2-1 and -na 2-1 have
tone 2-1 except when they occur with a stem which has final lexical tone 2-1; then
the suffix has tone I and the stem-final has tone 2.
Some examples of verbal nouns formed with suffix units -da 3

and two corresponding nasal alternants:
(a)Verbal suffix unit -di-de-ni‘.-‘-ne ‘instrumental’This suffix occurs with verbal stems to form derivative verbs whose meaning is
illustrated by the following examples:
du bla
dudi bla sfl
hli
hlidipound rice

smear withThe distribution of the four alternants is as follows:
-di occurs after stem-final i, u
22.~‘a~ —‘ ftSpecific verbal questions (see p. 108) are marked by this unit, which occurs after
the verbal stem, or after the tense suffix where this occurs:
Ida tie a kac?
cf. a kahow many houses has he?
he hasnya ne a dadaa? who is it he called?
cf. a dada he called~StemQuestion marker unit cThe distribution of the four alternants is as follows:
a occurs after a
c occurs after all other oral vowels
ft occurs after a
~ occurs after all other nasal vowels.
3. There are several units, the shapes of whose alternants are identical with, or
regularly related to, the shape of the stems (or part of the stems) with which they
occur. These units are best represented by formulae, rather than by a listing of all
their alternants.
(a)Verbal prefix unit CV- ‘reciprocal’This prefix unit occurs in verbal forms like:
a bibide ne
a nyenycne ne
a dododade ne
a yiyibôde newe have beaten each other
we have hated each other
we have missed each other
we have known each othercf. bi beat
cf. nyc hate
cf. doda miss
cf. yibô knowThe values of C and V in prefix unit CV- are:
C is the same as the stem-initial consonant
V is: (i) the same as the first vowel of the stem, except where this is c, a, a (or
their nasal correlates)
(ii) o/o where the first vowel of the stem is c/~ or a/ft. and the stem-initial
consonant is kp, gb, gm, f, w, ijw.
(iii) e/ë where the first vowel of the stem is c/~ or a/ft and the stem-initial
consonant is any consonant other than those listed in (ii).
(iv) o/ft where the first vowel of the stem is a/S.

element (always a vowel), CV represents the additive element.
ive
This suffix unit occurs with verbal stems to form verbal nouns which correspond
roughly in meaning to English verbal nouns in ‘-ing’. E.g.
duc pounding
cf. du pound
ne k~ duc
I have to pound
cf. k~
have
duc yakia ne
pounding is hard
cf. yakia hard
The distribution of -RCV and -v is as follows:
-RCV occurs with CV verbal stems whose vowel is a, s, ~ (or their nasal correlates)
-V occurs with all other stems,
The values of R, C and v are:
R: for R read:
I. o/ö replaces ~,/5 after all consonants; it replaces c/~ and a/i after b, f, kp,
gb, ijm, w, ijw. (Exception: e replaces £ after b).
2. e/ë replaces c/~ and a/i after all other consonants.
C: I. The same as the stem consonant where this is b, d, I, m, n.
2. The voiced correlate of the stem consonant where this is (i) hm, un, or (ii)
p, t, hi and the stem vowel is oral.
3. The voiced nasal correlate of the stem consonant where this is p or t and
the stem vowel is nasal,
4. Zero where the stem consonant is other than p, b, hm, m, t, d, hi, I, hn, n.","[10, 11, 12]"
"Imperative MoodThere are four tenses of the imperative mood:
Tense 1
Tense 4
Tense 5
Tense 6du bla 2 4
duc bla 22 4
dua bla 22 4
duda bla 22 4pound rice
pound rice today
pound rice tomorrow

As well as the indicative mood forms of du listed in Table 1, there are comparable
forms which differ from these in respect of subject pronouns and of the tone of the
verbal stem. Compare for example:my not going to London is good33na be yi London mu ~ t~

"Post-nominal adjectives
A class is established of words which occur in the position filled by hwi and pe
penadi in sentences like:
bli hwc no
bla pepenadc noit is a big cowit is a lot of rice,
but which do not occur in the position filled by di and ijmo in sentences like:
o di no
e gmo noit is their spear
it is their horn.
Some words occur in both sets of test sentences, e.g. ijmo ‘horn’:
bli gmo no
e ijmo noit is a cow horn
it is their horn.
These are nouns, since nouns are defined as words which occur in the test frame
o/e
no ‘it is their
(see P. 37).
Words which occur in the first set of test sentences, but not in the second will be
called Post-nominal Adjectives. (The qualification ‘Post-nominal’ is added to dis
tinguish words which occur in the above test sentences from words like pudóô
‘white’, which occur in phrases like pudóô kae ‘a white house’, and which are called
pre-nominal verbal adjectives; see below).
Some examples of post-nominal adjectives are:
——‘kuu

"Noun/pronounPostpositionPostpositions occur after nouns, both singular and plural, and also after object
pronouns:Eight types of nominal phrase are distinguished here, and all of these have two
immediate constituents (IC’s), except genitival phrases, which have three. The
shortest form of each type of phrase is described first; these (except phrases consisting

224382Tone
In verbal phrases containing an auxiliary verb, the main verb stem has the same
tone as it has in the imperative mood (i.e. its citation tone), except that stems be83longing to tone class 2 have tone 3 following an object with tone 4 (except in phrases
like ne ml na du m~, described in the previous paragraph).
114211242Future tenses of the imperfective indicative mood with auxiliary verb yi occur
in clauses in sentences where another clause expresses a contemporaneous action:
‘while I shall be pounding rice...’ The past tenses ne ylda ne dui ‘I was pounding
11 2433it before yesterday’ and ne yid~ ne did ‘I was pounding it yesterday’ occur only in

on the other hand, a possible answer is ne duida bia ‘I was pounding rice’. It will
11124be recalled that future tense forms corresponding to ne duida bia do not occur.
Subjunctive and Conditional Moods
All six tenses of both these moods are found.
In the subjunctive mood, as well as the 3rd person forms listed in Table 3 there
are corresponding forms which differ from them in tone, and which occur after
emphatic pronouns of all persons. The singular forms for verbs belonging to all
four tone classes are set out below for tense 1, preceded by the 1st sg. emphatic324132may I be killing it42-1m~ b~ yl ns gé

22221244Subjunctive mood forms of this type are found in all six tenses. For the corresponding
subjunctive mood forms without auxiliary verb, see p. 79.
Optative Mood
All six tenses are found.
Both forms of the 1st and 2nd sg. are current, but in the other persons the forms
enclosed within brackets are rare, and occur only in the speech of some older people.
The optative mood occurs only in the second clause of complex sentences. The
main uses of the mood are illustrated by the following sentences:12he told me to pound rice4The optative mood in the third example expresses an indirect wish, whereas the
subjunctive mood in the last sentence expresses an indirect command.
Negative conjugationNegative verbal phrases are formed with auxiliary verbs yi 2-1, yi 2, te 3-2 and
