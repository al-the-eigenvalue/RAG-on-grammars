"Morphologica1 investigation is primarily eoneemed wÏJth the systematie fonnal-sernantic correlations which may exist in the lexicon of a
language. It brings to light morphologica1 eategories, i.e. series of
words between which there is semantic and fonnal proportionality.l
Besides these morphologica1 categories proper, cart:egories of another
type may be found, which I sha11 call syntactica1 categories. Instead of
a formal-semantic proportionality, they show a forrnal-synttactic proportionality only: in opposition to other categories of words they share
both a forrna1 feature and a potential for entering into certain syn:tactic
constructions. All these proportionalities are best described in tenns
of a process tenninology.
In the second place, morphological investigation has to answer tbe
question to what extent and in what way the categories are imerrelated,
constituting systems which are generally called parts of speech or
(morphologica1) word classes. In a number of languages these systems
ean be thought of as being largely autonomous, 1mt for the frequently
occurring relations that are dealt with under the headings of 'transposition' or hypostasis. This morphologica1 model may be represented
by the following diagram: 2(1)II12IIIt is certain, however, that in other languages the word classes
show a smaller or larger amount of overlapping, because they mutually

in Javanese, in Por Roman Jakobson, The Hague, 1956, p. 569, and J. Kurylowicz, The inflectional categories of lndo-European p. 37 (1964).
2 An example of such a description is Schultink's study of the Dutch adjectives
(H. Schultink, De morfologische valentie van het ongelede adjectief in modern
N ederlands, Den Haag 1962). F or the terms part of speech and word c1ass

1106THE CARIB LANGUAGEshare a part of their categories. In such cases there are at least two
other conceivable mode1s of description. 3 The hierarchic model would
apply in those cases where systems form part of more-embracing supersystems. These super-systems in their turn may, of course, form part
of still larger wholes.
This might he symbolized as follows:
12(2)

4There are here, too, four different systems of categories which,
however, partly overlap. A represents categories which are found in
system 1 as well as in system 2, B represents categories which are found
both in system 3 and in system 4, while C represents categories that
occur in all four systems. 4
The chain-model would apply in those cases wh ere some relatively
autonomous system shares same of its categories with certain other
systems, and some of its other categories again with other systems.
What I mean may be illustrated by the following diagram:

The present descriptive study is not the place to raise the theoretical questiol1
how many different models it might he possible to conceive. The question as
to how far the first model has been developed under the influence of the
traditional theory of word classes also cannot he gone into here.
4 Hockett assumes that as a mIe a hierarchic presentation of the stem classes
described by him is possible. See C. F. Hockett, A course in modern linguistics,
New York 1958, pp. 221-222.","[125, 126]"

would eat') ; kuwa:imbo 'littie piece of a gourd', i.e. a small implement
cut from a gourd and used for moulding pots (kuwa:i 'gourd').
We have already come across suffixation with -mbo in the verbs
(3.1.3.2.2.). The process also occurs with the demonstmtives (3.5.2.),
the postpositions (3.3.6.), andthe adjectives 97 (3.4.4.). In all these
classes the mbo-category may he semantically defined by the term
'diserepancy' as it was used above; although not all the differences
found here were also found in classes other than that of the nOWlS.
Only I ('formerly, at one time') and 11 ('resembling, not real') were
found in all four classes; 111 ('bad, wretched, dear') and IV ('little
bit') are only known to me from nominal cases. On the other hand,
however, I do not know of any nominal cases where the 'discrepancy'
is to he taken in the sense of 'spatial distance or removal', as it occurs
in the verbs and d.emonstratives, and occasionally in the postpositions
(3.3.8E.) and the adjectives (3.4.6B.).
3.2.2.3. THE xpa-CATEGORYThe formation of the members of this category takes place by suffixation with one of the altemants:
1) -xpa
2) -'ma
3) -pa4) -main certain cases accompanied by prefixation of i-.
A simple rule determines this prefixation of i-: the prefix invariably
precedes initial C, replaees initial ï or ïi, but is not used if the initial
phoneme is avowel other than ï or ii.
The occurrenee of the suffix-altemants, on the other hand, is only
partly determined by rules. Fully predictable is, in the first place, the
occurrenee of the 3rd or the 4th alternant with nouns ending in a
diphthong. 98
Examples:
ka:rU/Ï 'blackness' , ika:raipa 'not blaek'; i:rui 'older brother', i:ruima
'without elder brother'.
With the postpositions and the adjectives -mbo occurs on!y in combination
with -no, apart from iso!ated instances Iisted in 3.3.8E. and 3.4.6B.
98 The occurrence of specia! alternants without x and y after diphthongs may
be seen as a consequence of a genera! sequentia! ru!e, see 2.1.1.4.1.
97226TUE CARIB LANGUAGEAlso prediatable is the occurrenee of -~ma when the monomorphematic noun ends in 1j or f'3 (which are dropped), and that of -~ma or -ma
when the monomorphematic noun ends in the syllable nï, which also
disappears when suffixation takes place 99. Again, -ma is used here
after a diphthong and -~ma after other vowels.
Examples:
PO:SI~1j 'sweetness', ipo:si~ma 'nat sweet'; e:rlDJ 'watchman', e:ra~ma
'unguarded'; ïxko:nï 'dirt', ixko~ma 'not dirtty'; a::~ 'heat', a:si~ma
'not hot'; exkïini 'smoke', exkiima 'not smoky'.
In all other cases either -xpa or -~ma is found without it being
possible to give a rule.
Examples with -xpa: wo:to 'fish, meat', iwo:toxpa 'without fish, meat';
ixka:rï 'anything living in water', ixka:rixpa 'without living inhabitants';
u:ra 'weeping', uraxpa 'without weeping'.
Examples with -~ma: pe:tï 'thigh', ipe:tï~ma 'without a thigh'; ïiyo
'husband', iyo~ma 'unmarried (woman)' ; are:pa 'cassava', ere:pûma
'without cassava'.
The fact that recent loanwords are suffixed with -xpa might he an
indica.tion that it is the productive altemant: e.g. bu:ku 'book', ibu:kuxpa 'not possessing books'. A further indication is perhaps the fact
that -~ma is not foond with verbs, although othe,rwise they form the
negative category in exactly the same way as nouns. 100
A number of noons loses the final syllable before -xpa and -~ma.
This phenomenon occurs in all cases en ding in nï in my material, and
in some of the cases in ti and ri, again without it being possible to
find a rule for the occurrence or Ilon-occurrence of the reduction.
Ni is lost in amo:ni 'avarice', am()~ma 'not avaricious'; ere~nï 'quickness, nimbleness', erûma 'motionless'; exkïinï 'smoke', exkïima 'not
smoky'; ïxko:ni 'dirt', ixko~ma 'not dirty'.
Ri is lost in me:rï 'drawillg, marking', imexpa 'without marking'
(said of skin of young animal) ; pi~'ri 'shyness', ipï:ixpa 'not shy';
ye:rï 'tooth, sharpness', iyexpa 'toothless, blunt'; ra:rï 'flat surface',
iraxpa 'without a flat surface' ; apo:rï 'arm', apoxpa 'armless'; eka:ri
'message' , ekaxpa 'without a message' ; ekï:ri 'thom' , ekixpa 'without
Not only nï but also the final syllables nu, f'ï, kï and ti are lost before the
suffix in certain cases; see further on in this section.
100 That is, as far as the transitive verbs are concerned. In intransitive verbs
there is yet another difference: initial tv is lost in the verbs, while in the
nouns w is treated as the other consonants, i.e. i- is prefixed before w. See
3.1.3.2.6.

ita:rïxpa 'without contents'; ïxka:rï 'anything living in the water',
ixka:rixpa 'without living inhabitants'; emïirï 'daugter', emïirïxpa

Ti is lost in epe:tï 'price, payment', epe~ma 'cheap'; i:pofi 'hair (on
the body)', i:poxpa 'hairIess'; tlxse:tï 'hair (on the head)', tlxsexpa
'baId'.

epi:tï~ma 'without medicine'.
FinaIly, something must he said about the nouns that are regarded
as bases for the formations described here. In generaI it may he
stated that the monomorphematic nouns serve as such, but a further
specification must he given for those nouns in which the syntactic
dist'inction discussoo in 3.2.1. is partly expressed by means of vowelalternation. Where this is the case, the same vowel appea.rs in the
negative formations as in the syntactic B-category. In the first place
this applies to the words with 0 I e-alternation; e.g.
A o:ma, B e:marï 'path', e:maxpa 'without apath'; furthermore to
the isolated case with ale: A are:pa, B ere:parï 'cassava-bread',
ere:pûma 'without cassava-bread'. lol aIso appIies, however, to the
two irregular cases with olï-altemation at the end of the word: A auxto,
B auxti 'house', aum~ma 'without a house'; A pa:to, B pa:tï 'place,
spot', ipa:tï~ma 'without a place, spot'.
The meaning of the memhers of the category may he described as
'without that which is designated by the corresponding monomorphematic noun'.","[244, 245, 246, 247]"
"3107MORPHOLOGYOf the four systems, 1, 2 and 3 share certain eategories, on the
one hand, represented by A. On the other hand, 3 shares some other
eategories with 4, represented by B. It is this double affinity of 3
which makes it impossible to arrange the systems in a hierarchic
structure.
N ow it seems to me that the most adequate method of description
for Carib is a combination of methods (1) and (3). The main COtlc1usion of my morphological investigation is that in this language there
are six morphologieal systems to he distinguished, one of which, that
of the numerals, is c1early separated from the other five: those of the
verbs, nouns, postpositions, adjectives and demonstratives; which
together ean he adequateiy described with the aid of model (3). Thus,
a schematic picture of the morphology of Carib may he given in the

indieation of the extent of the six systems and of the degree to which
they overlap.
Let us now first COtlsider the five systems of categories (or word
classes, the term that will he used from now on) which, while showing
differences, at the same time share same unmistakable agreements. As
to the differences, it is only the verbs (1) that have, for instanee,
eategories of tense and mood, only the nouns (2) that have a general-108THE CARIB LANOUAGEising category with the suffix -wa:no, only the postpositions (3) that

adjectives (3, 4) that have a no-category, the members of which
designate persons or things characterized by a property which is
designated by the corresponding monomorphematic word,5 while only

members of which characterize persons or things as belonging to a

TRANSLATIONS
WORD INDEX4. TEXTSIn my transcriptions of tape-recorded stories and conversations, I
have tried to reflect the special character of these spontaneous speech
documents. To this end, I have retained false starts, errors, hesitations
and anacoluthons, indicating them as such by a row of dots and, if
necessary, by an explanation in a note. Mutilation of word forms in
rapid speech has been indicated by placing in parentheses that part of
the word form, which was not audibly pronounced. In case of sandhi,
words have been written as they were heard, notes indicating how they
would appear in isolation. Words with free alternation of .X"" or ~ with
vowel length have in each case been written as they were actually
hoord.
Of the prosodie phenomena I can only give an incomplete picture.
Any interruption of the continuity of speech, Hnguistically relevant or
not, has been indicated by /; unless the interruption is associated with
a terminal pitch change, in which case / / has been used. Word accent
has only been indicated when it was clearly perceptible. For typographical reasons accent on ï had to he indicated by replacement of the two
dots by a circumflex: î. Stretching of vowels has been rendered by
repeating the vowel le'llter several times; e.g. kni 'oooh'.
In the English translations parentheses mark off insertions that have
no direct counterpart in the Carib text, but were added to facilitate
reading.
On the method used for recording and transcribing, see also the
section on field work, 0.4.3.","[305, 306, 307, 308, 309]"
"The meaning of the numerals with -no may be defined as 'something
containing so many components as indicated by the base, or: a member
of a group taking therein a place as indicated by the base'. E.g. o:wi:no
'a single one' (also a single-barrelled rifle), for instanee in o:wi:no me
roxkofJ si:woi 'let me deal him a blow as a single one only' (= 'let me
deal him a single blow only', me 'as', roxkofj 'only', si:woi 'let me deal
him a blow'); o:ruwa:no 'one who is third', for instance in no:kï ko
o:ruwa:no me na~? 'who is third?'
Unlike -pai and -mboto, -no may he combined with other morphological processes, viz. with:
1) Syntactical affixation, wirt:h y- and -ri, as found with many nouns 150.
2) Personal prefixation, with one of the five processes used with verbs
as weIl as with nouns and postpositions 151.
3) Plural suffixation, with the alternant -koij, as occurring in all word
classes 152.
Examples:
1) yo:morï yo:ruwa:norï mo:se ma~ 'he is the third member of my
family' (yo:morï 'my family', mo:sc ma~ 'he is').
2) o:we ko iyo:ruwa:norï 153 naijl 'where is tbe third one of it?'
(o:we ko 'where ?', na~ 'is').
See 3.2.1. The syntactical process consists here in the simultaneous addition
of a suffix -rï and a prefix y-. The occurrence of y- with these numerals is
remarkablc, because with the nouns it is confined to a few isolated cases:
as a rule, there is only -rï.
161 See 3.1.3.2.1.; 3.2.2.1.; and 3.3.2.
162 Sec 3.1.3.2.9C and D.; 3.2.2.4.; 3.3.5.; 3.4.3.; 3.5.2.
lä3 The personal prefixes (in this example, i- for third person) are always added
to thc words as thcy appear in the syntactic rï-category; see 3.2.2.1.
150284THE CARIB LANGUAGE3) mo:rokoiJ o:ruwa:nokofj se wa 'I want those triple ones' (mo:rokoij
'those', se wa 'I want').
Personal prefixation and -koiJ may he applied together:
iyo:ruwa:ncwïkoiij mo:se mafj 'he is the third of them'.
Suffixing with -no, with similar semantic correlate, bas also heen
found with the postpositions and the adjectives, e.g. eko:sa 'at, with',
eko:sano 'one who is at, with', ka:wo 'high', ka:wono 'one who is high'
(3.3.4., 3.4.2.). Yet, I do not believe that th is process is to he identified
with the process discussed here, because there are also important
differences, both with regard to their morphological and to their
semantic properties.
MorphologicaUy, both processes ean he combined with plu ral -koij:
o:ruwa:nokofj 'triple ones', eko:sano:koij 'those at, with', ka:wono:koij
'high ones'. Personal prefixation, however, may he combined with
numerical -no, but cannot he combined with adjectival -no. It is true
that with the postpositions, -no and a personal prefix may he found
within the same word (e.g. aye:ko:satlo 'one staying with you') ; but
still the situation is essentially different from the one we are finding
with th.e numerical category, because with the postpositions personal
prefixture may occur as weU without -no heing present (e.g. aye:ko:sa
'with you'), which is not tnte for the numerals. FinaUy, the syntactic
N-distinction does not occur together with the adjectival and postpositional no-process, but is strictly confined to tbe nouns and the
numerals witb -no.
Syntaotically, adjectival and postpositional no-formations may be
connected with an immediately foUowing noun, e.g. ka:wono we:we
ca high tree', aye:ko:sano kari~na 'a man staying with you'. Neither
numerical no-formations nor nouns can be used in groups of this type.
011 the other hand, the numerical no-category has one important
feature in common with the nouns, and with the noul1s only: the syntactic rï-distinction. Moreover, syntactically they are probably 154 fuUy
equivalent. Therefore, I am of the opinion that the numerical no-process
may weU he regarded as a means by which numerals are transposed
to the nominal class.","[303, 304]"
"Pinal positionIn this position only 1), 13 are found; and very rarely m, and the
cluster ~m.
Examples: aura1) 'language', e:ra'3 'guard'.
Only one case was found of both m and ~m in final position: am
'somebody, something, a little', ro~m 'otherwise, else'.
By the side of am, a:lnu occurs. It would seem plausible enough to
assume that am, with its exceptional fina,1 -111, is a reduced form used
in rapid speech. Yet this is not the case. In the case of ro~m, which
is doubly exceptional because it does not only end in m but is moreover
the only instance of a sequence of two consonants in final position, we
find a situation similar to that of a11l. By the side of ro~m the forms
ro:mu1) and ro~mu1) occur with a meaning which does not seem to he
different from that of the shorter fonn. Again, ro~m is by no means
confined to rapid speech.
When through suffixing 1] and 13 lose their final position, the following phenomena occur:
If the suffix has an initial consonant the result is different clusters
which can also occur in monomorphematic words: mb, nd (2.1.1.l.1Bl)
or ~m (2.1.1.1.1B2, the type wo:toxko~me).
1f the suffix has an initial vowel, 1) and 13 are replaced by n. E.g.
on the basis of aura1) 'language, speech', with -ïmbo, auranïmbo 'chat-70THE CARIB LANGUAGEting'; on the basis of wo:nel1j 'murderer' (which is fonned on the basis
of wo' 'to kill'), with -ïmbo, wo:nenïmbo 'mean murderer'.
Finally a remark about the frequency of finalfj and '3. It is strikingly
low in mooomorphemaJtic words: there are only 39 instances of fj in
my material, and even fewer instanees of '3 : S. On the other hand,
in polymorphematic words the frequency of fj and '3 is by no means
low, because a fairly large number of productive suffixes happen to
end in these consonants (see phonemics, 1.1.2.2.).
2.1.2.1.3.","[89, 90]"
"SYNTACTIC CATEGORIES3.2.1.1. FORMATION AND SYNTACTIC VALENCEIn a large part of the nouns we find two formaIly distinct categories,
between which there is no semantic difference but only a difference
in syntactic valenee. The members of these syntactic categories, here
provisionally designated A and B, are found as follows: A in isolation,
and besides in all word-groups where no members of the other category
occur, B in groups formed by the noun being directly connected with
a preceding other noun or nom,inal group, or also with a precedingMORPHOLOGY215demonstrative (3.5.), provided the latter refers to a separate person
or thing and does not perform the function of an article, in which
case A occurs. Examples:
A) kuri:yara! 'a baat!'; e:ro po:no kuri:yara 'a boat from here';
kuri:}'ara am wo:pïrï sene:ya 'I see a boat coming' (am 'a', wo:pïrï
'to come'); with a demonstrative: mo:ro kuri:yara wo:pïrï sene:ya
'I see the boat coming' (mO':ro 'that, the').
B) kasi:ri ku:riya:rarï 'boat for cassava-beer' (kasi:ri 'cassava-beer') ;
moxko ya:wo ku:riya:rarï 'my uncle's boat' (moxko ya:wo 'my uncle') ;
with a demonstrative: moxko ku:riya:rarï wo:pïrï sene:ya 'I see his
boat coming' (moxko 'he, his').
\\Te now pass on to the description of the formal difference between
the two categories.
Apart from certain cases with vowel-a1ternation, which will be discussed presently, the situatiOll is as follows:
The members of A are monomorphematic nouns;
The corresponding words in Bare forn1ed by suffixation with one of
the following a1ternants:
1) -rï
2) -rtt
3) -ni
4) -diThe first alternant occurs when the monomorphematic noun ends 111
avowel other than u, the second when it ends in ti. Examples:
A) kuri:yara
B) ku:riya:rarï
boat
to,'Ptt
to:puYtt
stone 86
The third alternant occurs when rthe mOllomorphematic noun ends in
a nasal, ex cept in one case, e:rafJ 'watchman', where the 4th alternant
was found: Examples:
A) a,'si~
e:rlIf3B) a:si:ni
e:randïheat
watchmanThe productive character of the formations with -nï, at least where e
precedes the nasal, is perhaps shown by the occurrence of -nï in two
recent loanwords from Sranan:86In a number of cases suffixation is accompanied by contract ion : we :we/we :rï
'wood', wï:wïjwï:rï 'axe'; we:yu/weiru 'sun', sese:wu/seseuru 'fringe on a
garment'; ki)'e:rejïxkerc :rï 'cassava'.","[234, 235]"
"276THE CARIB LANGUAGE4. Categories fonned by combination ofthe ba1J-, mbo-, and plural
processes.
3.5.2.1. THE bafj-CATEGORYSuffixation takes place with -baij.
Examples:
o:tïbaij se maij 'what kind do you want?' e:robaij 'one of this kind'.
o:'weba1j 'in what kind of a place?' mo:eba1J 'like yonder'.
o:yabaij kïno:saij? 'in what direction is he coming?'
o:yabaij itoxpa wa 'wherever it may be, I am not going' (itoxpa wa
'I am not going').
mo:nïbaij wa kïnï.rsaij 'he went to a point like that over there' (wa 'to,
as far as').
no:kïbaij tampo:ko? 'what kind of old man (do you mean) ?'
mo:scbaij 'somebody like him here', amo:robaij 'somebody like you'.
The meaning of the memhers of this category may he defined as:
'place, direction, thing or person as indicated by the corresponding
monomorphematic demonstrative, presented as referring 11:0 a kind'.
3.5.2.2. THE mbo-CA TEGORYSuffixation takes place with -mbo.
Examples:
o:wembo tuwo:se naij? 'where has he come from ?' mo:embo 'from over
there'.
e:ro ta:ro ro:teij e:rombo maij 'so far this story' (e:rombo 'this, now
helonging 1:(> the past', refers to the story just finished; e:ro ta:ro
ro:teij 'only lasting so far', maij 'is').
moxkombo ene:ko 'look at him, you know whom I mean'.
o:tïmbo a.nu:ku:tïxpa maij 'he does not know anything at all, even the
simplest .things' (anu:ku:tïxpa maij 'he does not know', o:tïmbo 'anything whatever, cóntrary to what one might expect').
Semantically, the category may he characterized by means of the
term 'discrepancy', as eXplained in the sections on the mbo-categories
within the other word classes (see especially 3.2.2.2.). The cases that
express a spatial removal: o:wembo 'from where', mo:embo 'from over
there', are most clearly paralleled by some verbal cases, and especially
by a few incidental postpositional and adjectival mbo-formations
(3.3.8E. and 3.4.6B.).
The anaphoric words irombo and ino:rombo, formoo with -mbo, areMORPHOWGY277used in a special way in stories, where they may serve to conclude a
passage and open a new one. In this - very frequent - use they can
he aptly rendered hy some sueh term as 'next'. E.g. irombo mo:ro po
maij 'next he lived there' (irombo 'the matter just mentioned, now dealt
with', mo:ro po 'there', maij 'he was') ; ino:rombo kï~ga:no ""yu:ta:pïi
ra/' 'next he said ""I have lost my way"" (ino:rombo 'he who is known
from the preceding part that is now finished', kï~ga:no 'said').
3.5.2.3. THE ne-CATEGORYThe name 'ne-category' for the plural has heen retained here for
the sake of uniformity. It is not meant to indicate that the alternant
-ne plays any part here in the fonnation of plurals.
In the same way as practically all nouns, the demonstratives referring
to inanimate objects have a plural fonned by means of the suffix -koij;
e.g. e:roko1j 'these', iro:koij 'those just mentioned'.
The plural of demonstratives referring to living ereatures, with the
exeeption of au 'I', is fonned by suffixing with either -aij (also found
with a few nouns) or -aro; combined with modification of the base.
The suffix i'S -aij in the following three cases:
no:kï
who
nort""kaij
who, plural
mo:kï
that
1nOrt""kaij
those
mo:se
this
mo:yaij
these
The suffix is -aro in the following four cases:
mort""ko

An isolated position is taken up by au 'I', which has for its plural

The plurals mort""ka:ro and nort""ka1j can OOth he further suffixed with
the ordinary plural suffix -koij. M o.rka:rokoij is used to refer respectfully to a third person (father, mother, wife's brother) ,139 while
noxkatjgo1j occurs as a plural of the taboo-word no.rkaij 'snake', which
to the speakers is probably identical with nort""kaij 'certain creail:ures'.
139There are analogous honorifics on the basis of pï:tï 'wife' aml tamil :si
'grandfather', viz. pï:)'atJgoij 'my respected wife' (pï:ya1J= plural 'spouses')
and ta:mukofj 'my respeeted grandfather'.","[295, 296, 297]"

In fact these 11 cases constitute the greater part of the very limited 91 material with a final nasal; I know of only 7 cases where the
syntactic cattegories do occur: su:rabaij j su :raba:nï 'beam of roof',
skeijjske:nï 'body', tefj/te:nï 'time', a:sifJja:si:nï 'heat', mo':siijjmo:si:nï

Finally, i:tuji:turu 'forest' is an isolated case, since the presence
or absence of ru has nothing to elo with a difference in syntactic
valence: both fom1s are syntacticaIly and semantically fully interchangeable.
3.2.1.2. NOM1NAL WORD-GROUPSIt is necessary to make same observations about the worelgroupcharacter of the constructions elesignateel B in the last section. As we
saw there, in many nouns a special syntactic suffixation with -rï
occurred, sometimes accompanied by vowel-alternation, e.g. A kuri:yara
'boat', B moxko ya:wo ku:riya:rarï 'uncle's boat'; whereas in cases
where the synt,actic category is lacking these constructions merely
contain the monomorphematic noun: e:tï 'name', moxko ya:wo e:tï
'uncle's name'.
WhaJt has so far not been mentioneel, however, is that in the Bconstructions the two componenfs must always immeeliately foIlow
each other,92 a fact which may weIl make us wonder whether these
constructions are not compounds rather than word-groups. The consequence of such an assumption would be that what we called 'members
of the syntactic B-category' in the last section could no longer he
assigneel the status of worels since they would only occur as parts of
compounds.
There are, however, three indications pointing to the fact that, in
9192A nasal as final phoneme is rare in monomorphematic words, see 1.1.2.2.
1t is true that mi 'late' and ~me plu ral .~makoiJ 'smaU' may be placed between
the two nouns, but it is doubtful wheth~r these elements themselves are words
and not parts of words. Mi itself cannot be separated by a third word from
the word to which it beloogs (ya:wo mi 'my late uncle'); ~me and imakojij
are perhaps identical with the words ï';>me, ï~makojij 'child, children' (loss of
initial ï is a normal sandhi-phenomenon) but, when used as diminutives, they
must always immediately foUow the word to which they belong (pïrï:wa ';>me
'smaU arrow', pïrï:wa ~makoiJ 'smaU arrows'). On ;>me, also 2.1.1.4.3B.·220THE CARIB LANGUAGEspite of the absence of clear separability, we have to do with wordgroups and not with compounds. 93
1) In analogous constructions with a rnonornorphernatic verb following
a noun there is clear separability, e.g. by na~net3 'first': moxko ya:wo
(na~net3) kura:ma kïnoxtaij 'he will (first) corne tI) look after uncle',
see 3.1.1.(lb).
2) The first nominal component of the eonstruction remains subject
to suffixation without any restriction, which is generally not the case
with compounds. E.g. maina e:marï 'path to a garden' (maina 'garden',
o:ma 'path'), imainarï:ko'Ïj e:marï 'a path to their gardens'.
3) Each of the two cornponents remains subject to the rules of wordstructure, formulated in chapter 2.
Finally, clear isolability exists in the A-nouns or, where the syntactie differentiati011 is laeking, in the rnonornorphematic nouns. They
rnay eonstitute the tatal word-content of a sentence, e.g. kuri:yara!
'a boat !', a possibility which m011omorphematic verbs (3.1.1.) and
postpositions (3.3.1.) do not have.","[238, 239, 240]"
"TRANSPOSITIONAL AD]ECTIVESEvery verb and every noun can probably he transposed to the system
of the adjectives. This is effected in the following ways.
1) Verbs, by suffixation with -sene, in certain cases attended by prefiXiture of i- or by removal of an initial w, according to the rules
fonnulated in 3.1.3.8. E.g. wo:pï 'to come', opï:sene 'just come'.
2) Nouns, except the five cases mentioned under 3, by prefixing with
t-, tï- or tu- and suffixing with -ke, -ne, -re or -me; e.g. on the basis
of wa:re 'song', tuwa:reke 'knowing many songs' (3.2.2.8.). The same
process is applied to a small number of verbs as weU, e.g. 11 :'u/a 'to
dance', tuwa:lle 'fond of dancing' (3.1.3.8. note).
3) Five nourus are tran,sposed by suffixation with -pe or -me and removal of a fragment of the base: panaxtorï I panaxpe 'strength' /,strong',
parixtorîl parixpe 'violence'/,violent', yaiJsikï:rï I yaiJsi:pe 'depth' I'deep',
mo:siiJlmo:si:pe 'length' I 'long', sa:niiJl sa:ni:me 'shortness' l'short'.
The transposed verbs with -sene have a no-category with -'rJ and
vowel change, exactly like the monomorphematic adjectives of the type
ipi:piye (3.4.2C.a.); e.g. opï:sene I opï:sena'rJ 'just come' /,one who has
just come'. Also the nc- and the mbo-processes, and their combination,
are applied in a fuUy regular way (3.1.3.8. and 3.4.5.).
Both the regular transposed nouns and the five irregular cases mentioned under 3, fuUy share the semantic distinctions as illustrated in
the paradigm of 3.4.5. FonnaUy ho wever , they show some deviations.
These concern:
131I have not found any semantic difference between this word and the next one.",[288]

grandmothers' .
3.2.2.5. THE no-CATEGORYWe .already found the substantivising no-process in the verbs
(3.1.3.2.13.), while - as we shall see later - it has a central position
in the system of the pos>tpositions (3.3.4.) and the adjectives (3.4.2.).
In the last two classes the process is applied direct1y to the monomorphematic postpositions or adjectives, whereas in the nominal class
it can only occur in combination with the negation-process discussed
in 3.22.3. 103
With postpositions and adjectives -no is the rnain suffix-altemant,
while -13 also plays some part. Although w~th the nouns it is only the
latter alternant that is found, we adhere to the names no-process and
no-category.
The suffix-alternant -13 is plaeed after the negation-suffix, which
undergoes the following modifications :
1) in the altemant -:rpa, a is replaeed by ï, P by b, and x is los.t. 1 0 4
2) in the altemant -~ma, a is replaeed by ï, and ~ is lost.
Examples:
1) ï:potï 'hair (on body)', i:poxpa 'hairless', i:pobï13 'a hairless one';
2) epe:"" 'priee, payment', epe~ma 'eheap', epe:mï13 'a cheap one'.
The meaning of the members of the category may he defined as:
ca thing or person to whichjwhom applies wh3Jt is design3Jted by the
corresponding word in the xpa-category'.
3.2.2.6. THE nano-CATEGORYThe members of this category are formed on the basis of monomorphematie nouns, by suffixation with one of the altemants:
1) -nano
2) -wa:noFurthermore, intial e or e: is always replaced by 0 or 0:.
For the verbs we find the same situation as for the nouns, with this
difference that with the former, the no-process may also he combined with
another process, that with -me; which does not occur with the nouns. See
3.1.3.2.13.
l04 This is not the alternation with length of x or :) often found in other cases,
such as, e.g., in e:kaxpa = e:ka:pa 'not bitten'. Here the vowel that
preceded x remains short, unless it has to be long in accordance with some
general mie of vocalic structure, see 2.1.3.

less complex than the shorter one follows from their semantic parallelism with the cases listed under A, B, C. a and b above, where it
was the shorter foml that was regarded as the less complex one.
Furthermore, to all the words of the type api:pime rule 2 cao also
be applied, in which case, however, final e before -13 is replaced by i,
not by a, as in the type apïimeI apïitnOftJ. Thus we find side by side
with the same meaning, api:pi and api:pimi13 'a shallow one', po:to and
po:tomï13 'a large one', etc.
The short form (po:to) and the long one (pO:tomi13) are freely
interchangeable in all syntactie contexts, except in direct coonection with a noun, where the form with mï13 is exc1uded. Thus we
find without any semantic difference po:to am se wa or po:tomÏfJ am
se wa 'I want a large one' (am 'a', se wa 'I want'), whereas in mo:ro
po:to ma:riya:rï tuta:se ma1j 'my big knife is lost' (mo:ro ma:riya:ri
'my knife'), po:to cannot he replaced by po:tmnï13.
The meaning of the members of the no-category may be defined as
'person or thing possessing the quality designated by the corresponding
monomorphematic adjective'. Cf., e.g., the meanings of ka:wo and
ka:wono in ka:wo ma:mïi 'you have built it high', mo:ro ka:wono
sa:mii 'I have built the high one' (mo:ro 'the', a:mi 'to build'), ka:wono
am sa:mïi 'I have built a high one' (am 'a'; the reference is to houses).
Omï:yame and poitome were feit by the informants to he c1early related to
the nouns o:miya:ko 'gir!' and poito 'young man, son-in-Iaw, paid labourer'.
There is, however, no question of identity of adjectival poito or omï:;).'a
'a young, beautiful one' with these nouns: apart from the fact that they
helong to a different morphological system, there is also a formal difference
in the case of omï:;).'a and o:mi).a:ko.
126 By the side of po:tome occur opo:/ollle and apo:tome, apparently without
any semantic difference. Thcre is, however, a morphological difference: of
the three no-forms po:to, apo:fo and opo:fo it is only the last one that
admits of possessive affixing and transposition; sec 3.4.6C. and 3.4.6E.
1215MORPHOLOGY263Unlike the monomorphematic adjectives, the memhers of the noeategory ean also he used in direct connection with a noun. This noun

"117255MORPHOLOGY3.3.7. COMBINATION OF THE POSTPOSITIONAL
PROCESSES WITH EACH OTHER
When we discussed the separate categories we already saw that
certain processes mus t occur in combimIltion with certain other processes: the plural process requires either personal prefixing, or reflexive
prefixing with as-, or suffixing with -no, the mbo-process requires
suffixing with -no.
Beside these compulsory combinations 0 p t ion a I combination is
als<> possible, namely of all prefixings (personal, and with as-) with
the no-process, and of the mbo-process with the plural process. This
means that in all 40 categories are formed, belonging to a system which
may be illustraJted by the following paradigm:
plural
processnoprocessawa:ra
Iike youawa:raine

Iike youawa:rano:koij

Iike youmbo-processmbo-process and
plural combinedawa:ranombo
one who is not
really like youawa:rano: konimbo
those who are not
really Iike youAll the words in this paradigm share the prefix a-, for second pers011.
Since instead of this a- it is possible for 4 other personal prefixes,
the prefix as-, or no prefix to be present, the system to be represented
in its entirity requires 7 paradigms in all. Five of these complete1y
share the structure shown above, two are different, in lacking an
equivalent for the plural awa:raine. This regards:
1) The postpositions without prefix, which always occur in connection
with an immediate1y preceding word, e.g. ayu:mï wa:ra 'like your
father'. Plural suffixing is confined to the word preceding the postposition, e.g. ayu:mïko~ wa:ra 'like your(plur.) father(s)'. The paradigm of these postpositions is in other respects equal to the one shown
above:

like -256THE CARIB LANGUAGE2) The postpositions containing the personal prefix for first person,119
e.g. wa:ra 'like me', ye:ko:sa 'with me, at my house', ï:ta 'in me'.
Their paradigm is equal to the one shown under 1): wa:rano 'one who
is like me', ye:ko:simo 'one who lives with me', etc.
As shown in the first paradigm, in the word formed by a combination
of personal prefixation and the plural process (awa:ra.ine) the plurality
pertains to the personal exponent: 'you, plural'. When hesides these
two also the no-process is applied (awa:rano:koij) the situation may
he more complicated. In the cases known to me, the plurality is related
to the non-personal part of the word: 'those who are like you'. However,
it is conceivable that the plurality may aIso pertain to the personal
part of the word, making possible two further interpretaJtions: 'those
who are like you(plur.), and 'one who is like you(plur.)'. Actually, this
kind of ambiguity has been found in similar verba! formations ; but I
have omitted to ascertain its existence with the postpositions (see
3.1.3.2.14 IV).
Finally, the position of the system in relation to the other word
classes may he summarized. The personaI prefixes are shared with verbs
and nouns, and furthermore the plural with -ne and diphthongization is
shared with the verbs only. The as-category, formed by means of a
prefix that can replace a- in the paradigm, is as a productive category
peculiar to the postpositions (for this reason it was not discussed in
3.3.2. together with the personal categories). Finally, the reduced
system as shown sub 1), without the ne-plural, is identical with the
complete system of the adjectives (see helow, 3.4.5.).
3.3.8.","[274, 275, 276]"
"Of the agreements the main one is the presence of the same set
of five personal prefix-categories in the verbs (1), nouns (2) and
postpositions (3); these categories are represented in the diagram by
area A. The foUowing examples show one of these five categories,
viz. the one with the value 'second person', formed by prefixing
with ay-:
(1) e:ne
to see
aye:ne
to see you
your medici ne
medici ne aye:pi:tï
(2) epi:tï
ayu:wa:po before you
(3) uwa:po beforeThe fact that the postpositions take part in these pers<mal formations,
while the adjectives do not, is one reason for regarding them as
different word classes. The second reason is that, whereas the reflexive
as-category 7 occurs with the postpositions, it does not with the adjectives. On the other hand, the adjectives do not have any categories
which are not found in the postpositions as weU. This is indicated in
the diagram by the shading of the bottom area, shared by the adjectives (4) and the postpositions (3). Whereas the adjectives are limited
to this bottom area, the postpositions belong to the two bottom areas,
as well as to the large area A, shared with (1) and (2).
It is true that this 1I0-category is not only found with postpositions and
adjectives but a1so with the nouns and verbs; with the latter, however, the
no-process requires combination with certain other morphological processes,
whose occurrence does nat depend on -no.
6 Suffixing is combined with modification of the base, con5isting in 105S of the
final syllable and replacement of c by o.
7 As discussed above.
IiMORPHOLOGY109The classes of verbs (1), nouns (2) and demonstratives (5) agree
in having a category formed by suffixing with -mbo, the members of
which share a value 'distance, discrepancy', either in a temporal or
in some other sense (area B in the diagram). Demonstratives (5) and
nouns (2) agree in having a plural formed by suffixing with -kofJ
(area C), nouns (2) and verbs (1) agree in having a category of
negation, formed by suffixing with -xpa or -~ma (area D). Examples: 8
to see
enembo
(1) e:ne
away from seeing
unseen
enexpa
medicine epi:tïmbo medici ne that is not effective or no
(2) epi:tï
longer used
medicines
epi:tïko~
epi:mma without medicine
this, no longer present
e:rombo
this
(5) e:ro
these
e:roko~
Class 6, that ofthe numerals, differs from the other five, in having,
among other things, a category with the suffix -mboto 'by . . . at a
time'; e.g.:
o:u!imboto once.
(6) o:wiiJ one
Whether there is any agreement between (6) and other classes is
open to doubt. The llUmerals have a category with the suffix -no,
which appears to show semantic agreement with· the no-category found
in the postpositions as well as in the adjectives, discussed above.
Examples:
(6) o:ko
two
o:kono
the second
(3) uwa:po before
uwa:pono one who is before
( 4) ka:wo high
ka:wono
a high ooe.
An important difference between the numeral no-formations and those
on the basis of adjectives and postpositions is, however, that the
former have all the morphological and syntaotic properties of the monomorphematic nouns, whereas this is not the case with the adjectives
and postpositions. lt would therefore he hetter to regard the numeral
no-category as a transposition to the class of nouns (represented in
the diagram by a long arrow) than to identify it with the no-category
in (3) and (4).
8The plural is also found in 1, both the plural and -mbo are also found in 3
and 4. In these classes, however, they require combination with certain other
morphological processes, whose occurrence does not depend on that of the
plural process or the mbo-process.","[128, 129]"
"271DEMONSTRATIVES3.5.1. THE MONOMORPHEMATIC DEMONSTRATIVES
First of all we are concerned with the twenty words in the table on
page 270, most of them clearly of a deictic character,134 which are
closely related bath semantically and formally. Later on we shall discuss
the morphological processes to which these words are subject.
Let us first consider the seman.tic aspeots. An important part is
clearly played by two distinctions: indefinite as opposed to definite,
and inanimate as opposed to animate. 135
Both indefinite and referring to an inanimate object are o:tï, o:we
and o:ya. Of these three words, o:we 'where' and o:ya 'whither', which
denote place and di rection , respectively, are distinguished from o:tï
'what, something', which does not have this spatial meaning. Examples:
o:we ko nafj? 'where is he?' (ko 'interrogative particle', naij 'is he'),
o:we na:re 'I don't know where' (na:re 'unknown to speaker').
o:ya ko nï:tofj? 'where has he gone?',
o:ya na:re 'I don't know where (whither)'.
o:tï ko e:ro na1j? 'what is this?' (e:ro 'this') ,
a:mu o:tï ye:nuru ta:ka nï:tofj 'something got into my eye' (a:mu 'a',
ye:nuru ta:ka 'into my eye', nï:tofj 'went').
A special feature of o:tï is that besides its function as a demonstrative, it ean also function as a noun or a verb. E.g. yo:tïrï 'something of
mine', kïno:tïyaij 'he does something'.
Corresponding to o:tï 136 'what, something' is no:kï 'who, somebody',
as an indefinite demonstrative word referring to a living creature.
The exceptions are o:tï 'something, what', and Ilo:kï 'somebody, who', as it
is not evident that they ""characterize with reference to the speech event or
its partiCipants"" (Roman Jakobson, Shi/ters, verbal categories, aJld the
Russian verb, 1957). On the other hand, same words that c1early do have
the ""shifting"" character of deictic words do not belong to the morphological
class described here: mi:}'a 'to the opposite side', mi).a:ro and miye:ro 'over
there, far away', and )'a:ro'wa 'hither'.
135 In this distinction animate applies to people and animais. inanimate to plants
and all other things.
136 Oxlo 'whatever' is c10sely related in meaning to 0: li; perhaps the only
difference is that oxto has an affective connotation. Oxlo, however, has no
counterpart referring to living creatures, such as o:tï has in no:kï 'somebody,
who', nor does it take affixes as o:tï does (see 3.5.2.). The same applies to
two other words which show same semantic and forma! resemblance to 0: ti:
oxtoro 'a certain number, how many', and oxtono:11Ie 'for same reasan or
other, why'; these words, toa, do not fit into the morphologica1 system of
the demonstratives. There is, however, a word oxtono:mlRj 'the reason why',
which occurs by the side of oxt01l0 :me in accordance with a process belonging
to the postpositions and the adjectives (3.3.4. and 3.4.2.).
134272THE CARIB LANGUAGEExamples:
no:kï ko me:nei? 'who did you see?' (ko interrogative partic1e),
imemboko no:kï e:bïrjke 'because he was not a small living creature'
(imemboko 'small', e:bïtJ ke 'because he was not').
o :we 'where' and o:ya 'whither' have no animate COUIIlterpart.
In the case of the definite demonstraJtÏves we also find the two
distinctions animatejinanimate and locational-directional as opposed
to non-Iocational-directional. Apart from these, however, there are
some further distinctions.
In the case of words referring to place or direction there is one
further distinction: near as opposed to far-oH. Corresponding to the
indefinite o:we 'where' there are i:ye 'there' and mo:e 'yonder', corresponding to o:ya 'whither' there are i:ya 'thither' and mo~ya 'to
yonder'. I:ye and i:ya are only used to refer to the immediate vicinity
of the spot where the speech event is taking place, otherwise mo:e and
mo~ya are used.
Examples:
mene:ya1j? 'do you see it ?', i:ye seta:e 'I hear it over there' (nearby,
speaker and hearer are looking for an animal in the bushes ) ,
o:ya ko nï:to1j? 'where has he gone?', i:ya nï:toij 'he has gone that way'
(speaker indicates the direction ).
o:we ko naij? 'where is he?', mo:e kïno~na:sa1j 'he is ea.ting over there'
(somewhere else in the village),
o:ya ko nï:to1j? 'where has he gone ?', mo~ya nï:to1j ya:rï :wa 'he has
gone over there, up the river'.
The distin.ction between nearhy and farther off is also present in
four of the five demonstratives which do not denote a place or a
direction. Thus e:nï refers to what is in the immediate vicinity of
the spot where the speech event is taking place, mo:nï to what is
farther oH.
Examples:
e:nï se ma1j? 'do you want this one here?' (se maij 'do you want'),
mo:nï para:Pi aitatJgo 'go and get that dish over there (para:pi 'dish'),
o:tï po:ko mo:ni po neixto1j? 'what were they occupied wÎlth over there?'
(o:tï po:ko 'with what', po 'at, in', neixtoij 'were they').1 37
131When combined with an indication of time, mo :1Ii refers to greater remoteness in time, e.g. mo:nï wi:ki 'next week'. When koro:po 'to-morrow' follows
mo:nï, a nasal is inserted: mo:nï fjgoro:po 'the day aftel' to-morrow'. The
addition of )IIC 'really, to a high degl'ee' produces mo:nï ~ne fjgoro:po 'two
days after to-morrow'. Perhaps these combinations with inserted fj are
compounds.","[291, 292]"
"147The nO'-categO'riesThe substantivising nO'-process is also found in the nouns (3.2.2.5.),
while it bas a central position in the system of the postpositions (3.3.4.)
and the adjectives (3.4.2.). In the last two classes the process is
applied directly to the monomorphematic postpositions or adjectives,
whereas in the verbal class it can only occur in combinart:ion with -xpa
(3.1.3.2.6.) and -me (3.1.3.2.11.).
With postpositions and adjectives -n~ is the main suffix-altemant,
while -tJ also plays some part. Although with the verbs it is only the
latter alternant that is found, we adhere to the names nO'-process and
nO'-category.
A) In the case of combination with -xpa, the alternant -tJ is placed
after this nega.tion-suffix, which undergoes the following modifications:
a is replaced by i, P by b and x is lost. 25
Examples:
etaxpa 'unheard', e:tabïtJ 'one who is not heard'; itundaxpa 'not arriving', itundabïtJ 'one who does not arrive'.
Irregular is the nO'-formation by the side of e:ixpa 'not being', viz.
e:bitJ 'one who is not', without i-.
B) In the case of combination with -me, the alternant -tJ is placed
after this suffix. The vowel e in me is replaced by a.
Example:
wO':to~me 'in order to kill', wO':tO'~matJ 'something to kill with'.
The meaning of the nO'-formations may he defined as: 'a thing or
person to whichJwhom is applicable what is designated by the corresponding xpa- or me-formation'.
Examples:
A) aurara:nO' ane:taxpa ma1J 'he does not listen to stories' (aurara:nO'
'talk, stories', e:ta ',tt> listen', maij 'he is'), aurara:nO' ane:tabïtJ me
suku:sa 'I know him as one who does not listen to stories' (me 'as',
suku:sa 'I know him').
B) pu:tu am ka:saij iwO':tO'~me 'he made a club to kill him with'
(pu:tu am 'a club', ka:saij 'he made', 'WO' 'to kill', i- 'him'), kïnixsaij
para:muru ~wa iwo:ta:11U1ltJ epe:ka:se 'he went to Paramaribo, to buy
something to kill him with' (wO' 'to kill', i- 'him', epe:ka:se 'to buy').
2.. This is not the free alternation of x with length often found in other cases,such as e.g. e:maxpa = e:ma:pa 'without a path'. Here the vowel that
preoeded x remains short, unless it has to he long in accordance with some
genera! rule of vocalic structure, see 2.1.3.",[167]
"The mbo-categoryThe members of the category are formed by means of the suffix -mbo.
Example: we:we ixko:to 'to chop wood', we:we ixko:tombo 'the farmer
chopping of wood, (coming home) away from wood-chopping (we:we
'tree, wood').
There are aIso mbo-formations which moreover contain a suffix with
a syntactic function, -ri or -se; it seems plausible to assume that the
possibility to combine each of the three types (-mbo, -rimbo and
-sembo) with other words, here toa, confarms to the rules formulated
in 3.1.2.1. This would mean thart: members of the mbo-category (without
-ri or -se) can only be expected to occur in a group (a) with se
'wanting to' or (b) with a verb of the type wo:pi 'to come', the latter
only, however, when the verb has na reduction of the final syllabie
and thus does not have the possibiIity of being suffixed with -se (see
3.1.2.1.).
In fact, my material does not contain a single case of type (a)
- which does not necessarily mean that these groups with se do not
occur - but only groups of type (b) containing a verb meaning 'come,
go', etc. E.g., we:7JJe ixko:tombo kïnoxsa1j 'he is coming from the woodchopping, which is now a thing of the past'. The additioo of wïino
'away from' is possible, without my being able to establish any semantic
difference: we:we i.t:ko:tombo wïino kinoxsa1j.
As long as one confines oneself to studying sentences like these,
one will be inclined to describe the meaning of the mbo-formations in
tenns like 'removal in space'. It is more likely, however, that in fact
the semantic wlue of -mbo is more general and comprises other forms
of diSitance or discrepancy besides the spatial one. We find confirmationMORPHOLOGY137for this when we consider mbo-formations that contain -ri- and thus,
in accordance with the rules of 3.1.2.1., no longer require the presence
of pre-eminently 'spa.tial' verbs like 'corne' and 'go'. The semantic value
of such fonnations may he expressed as 'not really taking place', e.g.,
in ya:saka:ri wo:marïmbo sapo:i 'I caught my friend who was falling',
(50 that his fall did not really take place; ya:saka:ri 'my friend',
wo:ma 'to fall' , sapo:i 'I caught'). Purely temporal removal is found
in mo:ro mata:pi ka:pïrïmbo i~wa eka:ri:ko 'teil about his fonner
making of the cassava-press' (mo:ro mata:pi 'the cassava-press', ka:pï
'to make', ~~wa 'by him', eka:ri:ko 'teil').
N on-spatial di stance or discrepancy is also found when the mboprocess is combined with other verbal processes (see below, 3.1.3.2.14.,
paradigm lIl), and with mbo-fonnations in other morphological
systems: nouns (3.2.2.2.), postpositions (3.3.6.), and adjectives
(3.4.4.).

of this limited material, both A and B may serve as the starting-point:
(A -+ B) In certain A-nouns with initial 0 or 0: formation of B
takes place partly by replacement of 0 or 0: with e or e:; or
(B -+ A) In certain B-nouns with initial e or e: formation of A takes
place by loss of -ri or -ru, and replacement of the initial vowe1 by
oor 0:.
An argument in favour of the first of these statements is that, as
is usually the case, the shorter farm is held to serve as the base. YetI
suspect that further investigation will show that the second statement
is to be preferred. For one thing it is an established fact that there
are nouns that always begin with 0 or 0:; e.g.
A) oko:mo
B) oko:mori

o:ti
o:tiri

This means that foreach of the A-nouns heginning with 0 or 0: it
would he necessary to state whether or not they replace the initial

B-nouns with initial e, e: have sa far been found, to which an A-noun
with o. 0: does not correspond. H fumher investigation. does not
bring to light such cases, the conc1usion will have to he that A is best
described on. the basis of B.
The belief that it is the words with e, e: that are best regarded as
the base is strengthened by what we found in three verbal categories:
those with -xpo, -topo and -ne13 (3.1.2.2.). There ejo-alternation was
found to occur, too, with the same function as is performed in the
nouns by -ri and e j o-alternation together. N ow in these verbal cases
there is a conclusive reason for considering the form with e as the
base, viz. the fact that it is the initial vowe1 of the monomorphematic
verb. E.g.:
e:ne

the fact of having been seen,
A) onexpo
B) enexpo

"THE STRUCTURE OF THE WORn FORMS103by a strong melodie rise on or towards the final vowel with the deviating
accent, a rise that seems to indicate a certain incompleteness. In most
cases this indication of incompleteness is as it were a prelude to a
supplementation by a wDrd-group or word in the same sentence; in
other cases such a supplementatiDn is lacking. We shall now consider
some sentences of both these types.48
1) Supplementation in the same sentence.
We find two word-groups, either pla.ced beside each Dther in an
enumeration, or connected with each Dther in a syntactic construction.
In bath cases we perceive by the melodic rise, which occurs in the
finrt group,49 thatt the rest Df the sentence will provide an addition Dr
a supplementation.
Between the tWD word-groups I generaUy perceived (in 21 out of
the 26 cases) a c1ear pause, here indicated by /. E.g. apo:rï ïmboka:tóij
/ isei:rï ïmboká:toij 'they untied her arms / they untied her legs'
(ïmboka:to~ 'they untied').
In the fDllowing case there was no pause. The boundary between
the two groups which - unlike the preceding 'enumeration' case stand in a syrutactic relation to each other, is indicated by -. a:mukó~
wo:ya:tóij - tïna:noká:rïko~ 'some they kiUed - to roost (them)'.
The word with deviant accentuation here is wo:ya:to~ 'they killed';
a:mukofj means 'some', tïna:noka:rïkoij 'what is rDasted by them'.
The melodie rise usually occurs at the end Df the first word-grDup,
but nDt in all cases. In the following case the phenomenon occurred
in the very first word, and the word-group does not end until aEter
mi:ya ~wa 'to the Dther side': tuwe:pa:to:sá~ me ro mi:ya ~wa / pa:poró mani~wi / keret3gá:to~ 'when they had thus passed through it tD
the other side / all the prickle-fish / they pulled Dff' (tuwe:pa:to:saij
'they had passed through it').
1t is prDbable thait in cases Iike these the words between the rise
and the pause never have a perceptible accent.
The melodie rise, and the expression of a certain 'incompleteness' are strongly
reminiscent of what Bolinger, writing about English, has called the B-accent;
in o.c. pp. 147, 143.
49 This rise and the relation between two word-groups as described here, also
occur when no shift of accent is possible because the word is always accented
on the last vowel, or even contains only one vowel. E.g. o:ruwá ~'u:1""It tïtunda
má!1, kasi:ri su:ka:toiJ kaba 'the third hoor just began, when they already
sieved the cassava beer'.
48104THE CARIB LANGUAGE2) No supplementation in the same sentence.
Two kinds of cases are known to me.
In the first place the melodie rise with shift of accent was found
in two sentences, expressing a question, respectively a request. In the
first sentenee the phenomenon occurs in ayu:pa:kái 'have you woken
up', in the second sentence in ipo:tna'J'jgakó 'stir it up': ""ayu:pa:kái he
ya:konó"" kïfJga:no i:wa ""'have you woken up, my friend"", he said to
him'. ""waxto ipo:'l'nafJgakó"" kifJga:no ""'stir up the fire"", she said'.
I think that, unlike the preceding cases, the rise does not link up
the first group with the second group. It seems more probable that
theanticipation expressed by the rise concerns the intended reaction
of the listener.
Secondly the phenomenon was observed more than onee in sentences
which, in the course of a story, merely indicated that the joumey was
continued: irombo kinïxsa:tóij 'then they set out', te kïnïxsa:tófJ na:pa
'then they set out again'. In these cases too, the rise can very weU be
explained as expressing incompleteness, hinting at the continuation of
the story.","[122, 123, 124]"
"MORPHOLOGY223of the tree ku:pesi:ni', as a name for the bushmasrer-snake. Here weinvariably find -po, not -mbo or -pombo (po:rirï = 'branch').95
The meaning of the members of the category may be defined as:
'what is designated by the monomorphematic noun, applied by the
speaker with some reserve because of the existence of a discrepancy
with regard to the real state of affairs'.
The discrepancy may be of various kinds:I. The noun used was at one time fuUy applicable to the thing in
question, but is so no longer. This temporal discrepan.cy may be expressed by terms like (A) 'formerly, at one time, originally'; other
cases, which may be rendered by (B) 'known for ages, you know what
I mean', probably also belong to this temporal interpretation of -mbo.
Examples:
A) paru:ru e:pïmbo aro:yalJ 'he took with him something that used to
he the stem of a banana-tree' (but has now been cut down and stripped
of its leaves; paru:ru 'banana', e:pï 'stem') ;
A) et""innbo xkuru mo:ro xudhop 'the original name of it, that was
formerly Good Hope' (but now the name has been changed to gudo:pu ;
e:ti 'name', xkurtt 'formerly', mo:ro 'that').
B) na:nambo am kïse~nï:ne 'let us eat some pineapple, you know what
I mean' (na:na 'pineapple', am 'some').
II. The noun is not fuUy applicabie: there is either (A) partial identity,
resemblance, or (B) irreality, non-genuilleness.
Examples:
A) apo:nïmbo 'what was his bench in a manner of speaking' (it was
not a real bench, but a rock that was used by a giant as a seat; apo:nï
'his beneh') ;
A) auxtombo 'species of fish, the form of which reminds one of a
house' (auxto 'house').
B) tako:nombo tïxka~ma:no 'her so-caUed friend made her trembie95At first sight maina:po 'old garden, where the forest is coming back, capoeira',
would seem to belong to this category, too. However, from a synchronic
point of view at any rate, this is a monomorphematic noun, alongside maina
'garden' and the formations with -po and -mbo which do correlate morphologically with it: mainapo, mainambo 'former garden, bad garden'. My informants showed no hesitation in distinguishing between maina:po and mainapo
which, for that matter, also differ formally from each other.","[242, 243]"
"***
To concIude this section, mention is made of fonnations which, in
my opinion, should be regarded as compounds, the components being a
noun and the verb ka 'to take away, to remove'. This is done becauseMORPHOLOGY241they strongly resembIe a transitive transposition-ca,tegory: for in stance,
we find side by side se:puxto 'to adom a person's legs with bands', and
se:puka 'to strip a person's legs of bands'; era:muxto 'to make a
person sweat' and era:muka 'to wipe the sweat from a person's brow';
ïxkondo 'to cause to become dirty, messy' and ïxkOfjga 'to clean,
clear up'.
In view of this clear parallelism it is perhaps possible to defend the
view that -ka is a suffix; it seems to me, however, that its description
as a component of a compound is unavoidable on account of (1) the
semantic similarity of -ka to the isolable verb ka '.to take away', and
(2) the fact that other verbs, too, may he combined with a preceding
noun to form a compound.
(1) The semantic similarity of -ka io ka becomes clearly apparent
when the constructions in question are compared with constructions
which are evidently word-groups, containing a word ka 'to take away,
remove' which may he separated from the noun:
Compound: i'ipu:puru ekï:ka se ma~ 'he waIllts to remove the thoms
from his foot' (tïpu:puru 'his foot', ekï:rï 'thorn', se ma~ 'he wants') ;
W ord-group: ipandarï ekï:rï ka se ma~ 'he wants to remove the thorns
of its branch'. Here separation is possible, for instance by na~n813
'first': ipandarï ekï:rï na~n813 ka se ma~ 'he first wants to remove the
thorns of its branch'.
Moreover the verb, with the required affixes, may he used without
any noun alt all: kïni:ka:no 'he removes it'.
(2) Other verbs may also he combined with nouns to form compounds;
and, as far as I could teIl, this is not subject to any restrictions.
Reduction of one of the components or of bath occurs frequently, and
always results in the compound being more in accordance with the
genera! rules of word structure, see 2.1.1.1.1C.
Thus we find by the side of the word-group pe :rï ka:no 'he removes
the hair from my forehead' (pe:rï 'the hair on my forehead') and the
compound pe:ka:no 'he removes hair from my forehead', the compound
pe:ko:to 'he cuts the hair 011 my forehead' (with pe:rï and ïxko:to
'to cut').
3.2.2.8. TRANSPOSITION TO THE AD]ECTIVESExcept in five cases to he discussed later, transposition to the
adjeotives takes place by simultaneous prefixaJtion and suffixation of
the monomorphematic nouns. Prefixation occurs with:242THE CARIB LANGUAGEa) tb) ti-c) tuSuffixaltion occurs with:
1) -ke
2) -ne
3) -re4) -meOf the prefix-altemants, a) is found when the noun begins with a
vowe1, b) when it begins with a consonant other than w, c) when it
begins with w. After t-, initial e, e: are replaced by 0, 0:. Examples:
u:ra 'weeping', tura:re 'whining, tearful'; mïirï 'snare' , tïmïike 'with
a snare'; wa:re 'song', tuwa:reke 'knowing many songs'; epe:rï 'fruit',
tope:ke 'fnlit-bearing'; e:kï 'pet animal', to:kïne 'having a pet animal'.
As to the suffix-altemants, there is again no hard-and-fast rule.
1t is true that with regard to 2) and 3) there is a considerabie similarity
in distribution to the verba! alternants discussed in the preceding
sections, but it is not complete.
-Ne is invariably found to occur with nouns ending in '1, ni or nu,
which have -na in the case of intransitive verbal transposition and -no
in that of transitive verbal transposition.
Examples with -na, -no and -ne: po:si1j 'sweetness', po:sina 'to become sweet', po:sino 'to sweeten', tïpo:sine 'sweet'; asi:woini 'c1earness', asi:woina '.10 become clear', asi:woino 'to make clear', tasi:woine
'c1ear'.
Of the two cases wiith ni, nu where the verbal transposition is irregular, one has -ne, while the other has the third alternant, -re:
ïxko:nï 'dint', ixkonda 'to becorne dirty', ixkondo 'to make dirty',
fixko:ne 'dirty'; me:nu 'blood', menda 'to bleed', metJga 'to cause to
bleed', tïme:nure 'bloody'.
The para1le1ism to the verbal transposition is incomplete, however,
in that -ne was also found with sorne nouns which do not end in '1, nï
or HIt, and which - in so far as the verbal transposÏition-forms are
known to me - do not have -na or -no in these forms.
The nouns in question are:243MORPHOLOGYauxto housee:kipet animalauxtïma to build a

-ndo, in yonái 'to cover', yondo 'to give cover', tïyo~ne 'provided with
a covering' ; wo':mï 'garment', wo:mindo 'to dress', tuwo:mïne 'dressed'.
We find the same sifuation for the third suffix-alternat1il: -re. It is
found with all nouns in which the transitive transposition takes place
by means of -ro, but also with some others. Examples of -ro and -re:
me:rï 'drawing', me:ro 'to provide something with drawing', tïme:re
'provided with drawing'; owaxpo 'caImness, kindness', ewaxporo 'to
caIm down, to put into a friendly mood', towaxpore 'calm, kind'.
There are also nouns, however, which are suffixed with a verbal
alternant other than -ro, but still have -re here:
a:ru

"A. The lingual stops.
The palatalized allophones of Iti and Id I are distinguished from
the non-palatalized ones by having a laminal 3 co-articulatio.n, voiceless
in the case of t Y • voiced in the case of dr. The situ3l1:ion is somewhat
different with I'lland I9 I: their non-palatalized allophones have a
velar articula1ion, their palatalized allophones (c and J) have an articulation which is lam in al only, without any velar co-articulation. This
means that the articulatory difference between t Y and c, dr and J 4 lies
in the fact whether the tongue tip is involved in the articul3ltion or
not: t Y and dr are formed with the tip and blade of the tongue, c and J
with the blade only.
The auditory resemblance hetween t Y and c, and hetween dr and J
was to me considerable, so that I found it difficult at first to hear any
difference. The reaction of my informants, however, made it c1ear to
me that there must he a contrast between e.g. pi:tY 0 'flatus' and pi:co
'littIe chap', or i:tYa 'in it' and i:ca 'to. get (something) out (of something e1se)'.
The articulatory terminology used is essentially that employed by Hockett.

symbolization of the laminals differs from that used by Hockett. c and Jare

pair of words was homonymous or showed a phonic difference uno
familiar to me, I proceeded as follows. I pronounced the two words of
which I wanted to find out whether they were homonymous, and then
gave the equivalent of each in the contact language. In all cases the
informants were able to state without any hesitation, either that a
difference which existed for them had been ignored by me, or that for
them too there was no difference between the forms of the two words.
The first proved to he the case e.g. with the pair cited above: pi:tYo
'flatus' and pi:co 'Httle chap', the second e.g. with awa:ra1 'species of
palm-fruit' and awa:ra2 (wa:ra with a-) 'in your way'. This did nat
mean, of course, that the informants, after having stated that there was
a difference, were able to say what the nature of the difference was or
what its place was in the sound-form.","[52, 53]"
"ACCENT IN CERTAlN TYPES OF SENTENCEIn a number of cases 47 the accent was found on the last vowel of

It is almost certain that this different position of the accent is
related to phenomena which belong to the larger units, word-group and
sentence. As, however, my investigation hardly concemed itself with
these Iarger units, it is not possible for me to ascertain whether this
shift of accent is subject to an absolute mIe, in the sense that the shift
invariably occurs in ce11tain types of sentence.
I only found that all the sentences in my material in which the shift
of accent occurs clearly agree in one respect: they are all characterized

"3.2.2.4. THE ne-CA TEGORYThe process by means of which plurals are formed is applicable to
the monomorphematic nouns. The name of ne-process was introduced
in an earlier chapter (the verbs, 3.1.3.2.9.) and is used here, too, aIthough in fact the alternant -ne does not play any part. Instead, two228THE CARIB LANGUAGEother alternants occur, the first of which was also found with the
verbs (by the side of -ne): 101
1) -ko~
2) -goijThe first of these is used when the monomorphematic noun ends in a
vowel, the second when it ends in a nasal. Examples:
1) wo:to 'fish', wo:toko~ 'fishes' ;
2) e:ra'fj 'watchman', e:r0/t3goij 'watchmen'; auraij 'speech, story',
aur0/t3go~ 'stories'.
In three cases suffixation with -ko~ is accompanied by a further
modification of the base: ï~me 'child', ï~mako1J 'children'; tamu:si
'grandfather', ta:mukoij 'grandfathers' ; kaxto:po 'uncle', kaxto:ko~
'uncles'.
In a number of cases the rule given above does not apply at all:
suffixation takes place with -sa~, -ya~ or -naij, and the final syllable
before the suffix is usually lost.
-Safj was found in three nouns ending in po: epïxpo 'pip, seed',
epïxsa~ 'pips, seeds'; upuxpo 'head', ttpuxsa~ 'heads'; ye:po 'bOlle',
ye:sa~ 'bones'.102 Also in uwa:poto 'prominent person', uwa:poto:saij
'prominent persons', where the final syllable remains.
Most words which form their plurals with -yaij or -naij refer to
re1atives:
-Yaij was found in apo:remïfJ 'owner', apo:reyaij 'owners'; no:tï
'grandmother', no:ya~ 'grandmothers' ; pa:rï 'grandchild', pa:yaij by the
side of regular pa:rïkofj 'grandchildren'; pï:fi 'wife', pï:yaij 'wives'.
In other cases the final syllable remains: pi:rï 'younger bro.ther'.
pi:rïyafj 'younger brothers'; wokï:rï 'man', wokï:rïyaij 'men'; also in
wo:rïi 'woman', wo:rïiyaij 'women' there is no modification of the base.
-Na~ was found in enauxti 'sister', enaunaij 'sisters'; ï:rui 'ol der
brother', iruina~ 'older brothers'.
With all words denoting relatives the plural can also he used
honorifically; this applies both to the regular plurals (with -koij) and
to the irregular plurals enumerated above. E.g. tï')wo 'brother-in-Iaw',
tOwokoij 'brothers-in-Iaw, honoured brother-in-Iaw'; no:tï 'grandmother', no:yafj 'grandmothers, honoured grandmother'. To the words
with -yaij or -naij the regular suffix may he added. as well, in which

"MORPHOLOGY197being present, but in th is case I have not found any semantic difference
from a groop which would arise if the form ma1j 'he, she, it is',
mentioned sub (a), was added. The word with tï- invariably precedes
the word directly connected with it, but need not precede it inunediately.
Examples:
a) tuta:se ma1j 'she has lost her way', tuta:se wa 'I have lost my way',
to:ne ma:na 'you have been seen';
b) tuta:se me:i 'you have really lost yom way' (me:i optative/
affirmative Znd pers. to we:i), toka:nuiye kïnoxsa1j 'he comes running'
(eka:numï 'to run', kïnoxsaij 'he comes), am anuiye toka:nuiye mïxsa
'you go to pick up a coupie, running' (am anuiye 'to pick up a coupie',
mïxsa 'you go') ;
c) tuwo:tapoiye tera:pa axtaine 'as they had already taken each other',
(tcra:pa 'already', axtaine 'as they') ;
d) ani po:to ixpori:rï ihva tïpa:to 'a big creek has been crossed by
him' (am po:to ixpori:rï 'a big creek', i~wa 'by him', pa:to 'to cross').
Thc semantic content of the sentence remains the same, as far as I
could ten, when ma1j 'he, it is' is added after tïpa:to. In my text-material
cases without maij are rare.
I do not know whether, apart from the verbs mentioned under a, b
abOove and axtla, any other verbs and postpositions may be connected
with the members of the tï-category. On the basis Oof my material it
would seem that the constructions with maij and we:i are much more
frequently used than those with the other verbs and axta.
As the examples cited showed, .the word connected with a member
of the tï-category gives, by means of its personal exponent, an indication
with ~rd to the person involved in the action. In the case of
intransitive verbs it is the person from whom the action proceeds, in
the case of transitives it is the person al\: whom the action is directed.
In order to indicate the performer of the action, too, in a transitive
tï-fom1ation, use may be made of a group with the postposition ~wa
'to, by', or of a personal derivation from this postposition: ï~muru
~wa tïka:se ma1j 'it has been made by my son' (ï~muru 'my son', ka:pï
'to make'), i~'wa tïka:se maij 'it is has been made by him'.","[216, 217]"

"C) A co-variant of xl:.
In those words in which alternation of V: with V x occurs, it sometimes happens that what is heard is neither a long vowelnor a sequence
of avowel and a clear fricative. The sound is merely a weak, hardly
localized noise without any voice, e.g. paHpora by the side of paxpora
and pa:poro 'all'. The voicelesssound which is here represented by H
can therefore occur only in those cases where x and vowel-Iength do
not COOitrast with each other: moxko 'he' can no more he replaced by
moHko than by mo:ko; po:ko 'with' no more by poHko than by poxko.
H also does not occur in those cases where there is alternation, not
of Vx and V:, but of V~ and V:.
D) The use of the forms with different alternants.
Little can be stated with certainty about the difference in use between
the forms with V x, respectively V~, and the corresponding forms with
V:. The only thing that is certain is that there is no semantic difference
and that the same speakers use V x and V: indifferently in the same
word. I had the impression that my informants - men of about 60 I am not certain whether 'mel:me 'small' and ï~melï:me 'child' are one
and the same word, the first being a shortened form of the second. Semantically this is not improbable: pïrï:wa ~me 'child of an arrow' = 'small
arrow'. An argument in favour of their' identity may he found in the fact
that both have the same irregular plu ral, with vowel change: pïrï:wa 'mako'Ïj
'small arrows', ï'mako'Ïj 'children'.
10 Morphologically, ~wal :wa is a normal postposition, behaving in the same way
as e.g. Ia 'in', má:ro 'with' (3.3.). ~mel :me perhaps is to be identified with
ï'melï:me 'child', which would make it a noun morphologically (see 3.4., and
the preceding note). There are still two other elements with an initial cluster,
both also showing the alternation with length of the preceding vowel: 'nel :ne
'really' and :rkurul :kuril 'already'. In these two cases, the choice of the
alternants to some extent depends on the structure of the preceding word.
Partly for this reason, they are discussed separately (enclitics, 2.3.). Neither
')nel :ne nor :rkllrul :kuru belongs to a morphological word class: there is
not any morphological process that may be applied to them.

and daughters. On one occasion I was struck by the fact that in a
conversation hetween afather and his son the fonner pronounced a
word with V:, and the son, in reply, used the fonn with Vx.
Finally I do not know how the fact that the same speaker uses
both V: and Vx or V, indifferently is to he accounted for. It does
not seem improbable that in emphatic speech the use of V x instead of
V: occurs more frequently, but even this is not certain.

'given to lying, mendacious'.
In cases other than those so far mentioned, alternant 1) occurs; e.g.
mauru 'cotton', tïmauruke 'provided with cotrt:on'; ye:rï 'tooth, sharpness', tïye:ke 'with teeth, sharp'; 'wa:re 'song', tuwa:reke 'knowing
many songs'.
An exception is formed, however, by five nouns in which transposition takes place in a very different way, viz. without prefixatiol1,
only with suffixation. Four have -pe, one has -me. They are: panaxtori
'strength', panaxpe 'strong' ; parixtorï 'violence', parixpe 'violent','
yafjsikï:rï 'depth', ya~si:pe 'deep'; mo:si~ 'leng;th', mo:si:pe 'long';
sa:ni~ 'shortness', sa:ni:me 'short'.
In this caJt:egory, too, affixation is in many cases accompanied by
reduction of the noun, in the process of which the final syUables ti,
ki, ku, ri, rtt, ni or nu often, but not always, disappear, without it
being possible to formulate a rule for this. It also happens that a
particular noun undergoes reduction in one process and not in another.
A list of these discrepancies is given here, but it is no doubt incomplete. The matter needs further investigation. The enumeration
given in 3.2.2.3. serves as a basis.
a) Nouns that are reduced in the negation-category (with -xp a or
-~ma) and in the transposition-categories as weU.
Example:
ï:potï 'hair, feathers on body'; i:po:rpa, ï:poxto, tï:poke.

the transposition-categories either.
Example:
ta:ri 'COtJJtents'; ita:rïxpa, ta:rïxto, tïta:rïke.
c) Nouns that are not reduced in the negation-category, but are in the
transposition-categories. The foUowing cases are known to me. Gaps
do not indicate that a particular form does not exist, but only that it
is lacking in my material.

130 As omuxka does not exist as a word and tuwo:mllxka does not appear to
have any semantic feature that can be specially correlatoo with fIlW-, the
word must be regarded as being monomorphematic. Strangely enough, it
behaves as if tllW- was a prefix, for this fragment is lost when -xpa is
affixed; while morcover tuwo :ul1Ixlw has a structure which is only found
in polymorphematic words (2.2.2.1.): .t' follows avowel other than the first

"30THE CARIB LANGUAGEIn accordance with this central position of the word in all subsyste:ms
of language, the phonemes of chapter 1 are units that have as their
function the marking and distinguishing of wor d s, and their inventory is made by seeking for oppositions by means of the comparison
of isolated words. No attempt has been made here to systematize the
phOlllemic inventory on the lines of ]akobson's general theory: a
conventional phonetic framework has been used. In one case however
- that of the nasal phonemes - it could he shown that adoption of
distinctive feature analysis will lead to a more satisfactory description
than the present one.
In morphology, too, the fundanlental unit is the word: the classes
in chapter 3 are systems of categories of words, in which the words
take up their place according to their mutual forma:l/semantic oppositions. Morphology heing conceived of in this way, the WP (word and
paradigm) style of morphological description 83 evidently is the most
suitable one. As rightly stressed by Robins, this type of grammatical
statement eau easily accommodate apr 0 ces s terminology ,84 while
on the other hand it also makes it possible to give due consideration
to the ent i tie s on which the processes ean operate. 85
As was stated above, morphological eategorization started from
regular formal and semantic differences hetween words. N ow it has
become clear that in Carib - as in other languages - many regular
formal differenees are not restricted to words belonging to a few
categories, but ean be seen as resulting from more general regularities
that pervade the whole lexicon. Snch general rules have been described
separately, within the framework of a general discussion of the phonemie make-up of the Carib words, which is found in chapter 2. For
further particulars the reader is referred to the introductory sections
of the third and the second chapters (3.0., 2.0.).
Problems properly pertaining to syntax, such as the formation of
word groups, had to he gone into at several points in chapters 2 and 3.
Iintend to devote a later publieation entirely to this subject.
Finally, some transcriptions of tape-recorded material have been
added.

Carib has 35 phonemes: 17 consonant phonemes and 18 vowe1
phonemes.
The consonant phonemes are (1) six stops: p, t, k, b, d, g, (2) four
nasals: m, n, ij, "", (3) wand y, (4) Y, (5) S, (6) x and ~, (7) h.
The vowel phonemes are (1) six short vowe1s: a, C, 0, i, ï, u, (2) six
long vowels: a:, e:, 0:, i:, ï:, U:, (3) six diphthongs: au, ai, ei, oi, ïi, ui.","[49, 50, 51]"
"***As was noted at the beginning of this section, many nouns lack the
distinction between a syntactic A- and B-category. Thus we find alongside exkïinï se:nei 'I have really seen smoke', waxto exkïini se:nei
'I have really seen the smoke of the fire', with the same form exkïinï,
without ,.ï or vowel-alternation.
I have not completely succeeded in fom1Ulating rules for the occurrence or non-occurrence of the formation of syntaotic categories.
This may be due to the fact that my investigation was not thorough
enough, but I believe that there is in fact no complete regularity in
this matter.
In sa far as it is possible to detect regularity, it lies in the faet that
(1) there is no formation of syntaotic categories in the great majority
of nouns ending in ï. There are, however, (2) also noons in ï where
syntactic categories are foond, and conversely (3) nouns ending in
avowel other than ï or in a nasal where they are not found. I have
not succeeded in finding any mIe enabling one to prc<liot whether a
noun belongs to 1, 2 or 3.
1) Examples of nouns in ï withOUJt syntactic categories: emexpï 'forehead', koxfi 'ery', e:kï 'pet animaI', wo:mi 'garment', ye:ni 'storage,
packing', ttnài 'treetmnk', wokï:rï 'man', ekï:ri 'thorn', isu~Wi 'lath,
split palm rib'.
2) The cases in my material en ding in ij with syntactic categories:
o:ti/o:firï 'thing', po:tï/po:firï 'upper lip', re:tï/re:tïrï 'top', ore:kï/
ere:kïrï 'wOUl1d', pï:mï/Pi:mïrï 'neck', ta:mï/ta:miiri 'tobacco'.
3a) The cases in my m.a.terial ending in avowel other than ij without
syntactic categories: epïxpo 'pip, seed', pi:po 'skin, bark', turu:po
'heart', ttpuxpo 'head', ye:po 'bone'; 90 ako:no 'friend' (male or female),
ektt:ntt 'waist', pll:nu 'flesh', ï~me 'child', ï~mo 'egg', Pmuru 'son',
ïmba 'shoulder-blade', ïiyo 'husband', uwembo 'helly'.
3b) The cases in my material en ding in a nasal, wÎJthout syntactic
~oAs against these 5 cases in po that are not suffixed with -ri, there are two
where this does happen: tllxPO/lllxpori 'spoon', wïrï:po/wï:rïpo:ri 'sweepings'.",[238]
"74THE CARIB LANGUAGEexeeptiO'nal structure in this case is eertain, in view O'f the great number
O'f bivocalie words in the material.
The second pattem is found in kuri:ta:nene 'noon, mid-night', which
may cO'ntain kuri:ta 'day' with an otherwise unknown reduplicatioo of
the encIirt:ie :ne 'rea!'.
The third type O'f vocalic structure occurs in ika:rikana:ri 'cinnamO'n
wood', the O'nly monomorphematic WO'rd with six vowels. This pattem
corresponds to a doubling of the trivocalic pattem - + -, so that
ika:rikana:ri gives the impression of being compounded of two trivocalic words. Yet is it improbable that we have a compound here. as
neither ika:ri nor kana:ri occur as separate words.
Let us O'nce more con si der the various types O'f vocalic structure
as set out in the tabIe. 1t is true for all of them that with regard to
the first twO' VO'wels only two arrangements are possible: either the
first vowel is short and the second long, or the first is long and the
second short. Further comparison shows that also the length of the
other vowels is related in a simple way to that of the first two: the
second vO'wel following the long first or second vowel is long as weIl,
provided it is not in final position or precedes a final consonant; since
according to a general mIe no long VO'wels ean occur in these positions.
We therefO're find with a long secood vowel, a long fourth VO'wel in
the pattern - + - + -; and with a long first vO'wel, a long third
one in the pall:tem -I- - -I- - ; while the second vowel follO'wing the
long O'ne is not long in the patterns -I- - - and - + - -, where it
has final position.
The fact that the table O'n page 72 also applies to agreat many polymorphematic words, implies bath the occurrence of affix-alternants
which differ only as to the being either long or shO'rt of their vowels,
and the occurrence of lengthening or shortening of vowels belooging to
the base. These alternatioos and modifications are generally determined
by the following factors:
1) the vocalic structure O'f the base,
2) the number O'f vowels added, either by single or repeated prefixing,
or single or repeated suffixing,
3) the identity O'f the affixes used.
The third factor is of less importance than ·the other two. Affixing
with the syntactical suffix -rï,14 the personal prefix y- (lst person),
14-ri, or one of its coalternants -ru, -ni and -di, are added to many lIIonomor-THE STRUCTURE OF THE WORD FORMS75or with both together, in certain circumstances may result in a shift
of vocalic pattern, one regular pattern (short-long) being replaced by
the other, corresponding, regular pattern (long-short). There are other
suffixes that also may modify in a special way the length of one vowel
in the base; however, this modification never leads to the emergence
of a new, still regular pattern, but always to disturbance of the
regularity. Therefore those other suffixes will be discussed later, in 2.2.
It would no doubt be better in our discussion to start from all the
types of vocalic structure conceivable on the basis of the combination
of the three factors mentioned above. My limited material, however,
does not admit sueh treatment. I shall therefore begin at the opposite
end and, starting from the available polymorphematic cases with a
regular vocalie structure, I shall examine what alternations and modifications have occurred in their formation.
We shall deal suceessively with polymorphematic words containing
2, 3 and 4 or more vowels. Those affixing processes which dot not
add avowel to the base need not be discussed; with the exception,
however, of prefixing with }'- which, as we have seen, may be attended
by special quantitative modifications. The words will be discussed in
this order: first those words whieh only contain sllffixes, next those
that only contain prefixes, and finaUy those that co11'tain prefixes as
weU as suffixes.
A) Polymorphematic words containing 2 vowels.
A.I) Only suffixes.
The mIe according to which bivocalic words have the vocalic structure + - also applies, without any limitation, to the polymorphematic
words. This implies that the short vowel of a base with one vowel, in
suffixing is always lengthened. E.g. on the basis of fa 'in', with -no,

phematic nouns. This process has not any semantic consequence (kuri:yara= ku:riJ'a:rarï 'canoe'), its function being purely syntactical (3.2.1.).
Personal prefixing in nouns is not applied to the monomorphematic forms,
but to thc members of this syntactical rï-category; e.g. kuri::yara 'canoe',
aku:riya:rarï 'your canoe'. As both the process of the Ist person and that
of the 3rd person have a zero alternant, nouns with -rï permit a personal as
weil as a non-personal interpretation, e.g. ku:riJ'a:rarï both 'canoe' and 'my
canoe', e :marï both 'path' and 'hls path' (3.2.2.1.).","[93, 94, 95]"
"EXPRESSIVE ACCENTA shifting of the accent to the first vowel has an expressive value,
as it has in certain other languages. A small number of cases were
found, both of the type with one, two and three long vowels and VCCsequences.
Examples:
para:nakï:rï wa:ra káre:ta po:ko kaxtaine 'if we had pap e r like
the Europeans (kare:ta 'paper')'; támpoko:rï 'tremendous !'; to'ko:ki
wó:pe:matopombo 'the dangerous place where (the monster) T. used
to go to the river' .
The second example, támpoko:rï, strikingly illustrates the affective
character of the shift of the accent. This word tampoko:rï, which means
'my old man', practically always has the accent on the first vowel when
it is used in the sense 'tremendous I'.
In one case I noticed a second accent besides the expressive accent:
i:ro po:ko mïne:pu wótï:toxpómbo iwo:tï:totóxkofj 'on that occasion a
flight of stairs came down (wótï:to.rpómbo came down, i.e. from
Heaven) as a means for them to go down by'.
Finally it should he noted that also a first vowel that is short (and
is nat followed by CC) can bear this expressive accent.
2.5.3.",[122]
"RULES OF ACCENTVATIONThe accent is a prominence which - it seems to me - is effected
in the first pla.oe, if not solely, by pitch variations. 42
Accentuation in Carib is regular. The position of the accent mainly
depends on the number of long vowels, diphthongs and VCC-sequences
occurring in the word. From an accentual point of view there is a
clear equivalence among these three.
1) If in a given word onIy one long vowel, diphthung or VCC-sequence
occurs, then the accent always falls on the last vowel.
In the available material the following types are represented:

2) If two long vowels, diphthongs, or VCC-sequences occur in a word,
the accent always falls on the second of these segmeI1l1:s.

4STHE STRUCTURE OF THE WORD FORMS97The available material does not allow us in all cases to st3l1:e with
certainty in how far the open spaces in the table are due to gaps in
the material, or reflect certain structure rules. The latter is certainly
the case in most of the open spaces in the fifth and the sixth column,
which show the second, accented, segment in final position. All combinations with a long vowel or VCC-sequence for their second segment
are excluded here, since these segments cannot occur finally.43
When a diphthong stands immediately before a CC-sequence, such
a segment (diphthong-consonant-consonant) is again coUl1ll:ed as one.
E.g.: kuixkasé:re, auxtá:rï, kïteixtá:toiJ, auxtómbo, amïixpómbo, kïna:mïixtafj.
In three cases I noticed a second accent, besides the accent according
to the rule: ini:pá:torîkofj, aye:Pá:nopïrï, mitu:wá:romatáke. The fact
th311: the accented vowel is followed by a fairly large number of vowels
(3, resp. 4) will have played a part in these cases.
These three words also occur, however, without the second accent,
without there being any difference in meaning.
No difference in degree between the two prominences was noticed
by me.
3) If three long vowels, diphthongs, or VCC-sequences occur in a word,
the second long vowel, diphthong or VCC-sequence bears the accent in
185 out of the 228 cases in my material.
If the available material is arranged according to type, the situation
is as follows: 444344See 2.1.2.1.2. and 2.1.2.2.3.
Of the 9 conceivable combinations with D as the first of the three segments
only D L L has been included in the tabie, this being the only combination
that was found (in kinaipa:sa:tO'ij).","[116, 117]"
"MORPHOLOGY145me in the type pa..-rkato~me is not identieal with this word me. For that
matter, the reverse possibility deserves oonsideration, too: is not it
possible that in other cases where combination of a verbal fonn with
this postposition me is assumed 22 we rea11y have to do with a suffixed
-me, just as in pa:rkato~me?
A c1ear distinction between word and suffix is made difficult in
this case because me, like all other non-prefixed postpositions, always
has to immediately follow the word with which it is connected and
thus resembles a suffix in this respect.23 AIthough there are, it seems
to me, three arguments against the altemative inrt:erpretations mentioned
above, I would certainly not exclude the possibility that, when more
facts have come to light, a more satisfactory analysis may be put
forward than the one given here.
I) On the whole there is no reason to regard me following a verbal
form as anything other than the postposition me, because replacement
by other poSitpositions is possible; e.g. ke 'with': aembo mo..-rko we:i:po
me 'when he had finished', aembo mo..-rko we:i:po ke 'because he had
finished.'.
2) Only in the formation of the type pa..-rkato~me on the basis of paxkato:po does the phenomenon of reduction clearly indicate that -me is
a part of a word and not a word. Nor is replacement of this -me by a
postposition possible.
3) The members of the topo-caregory ean also be combined with me
without red.uction occurring, and in this ease it is natural to regard
me as a postposition. It is not certain whether the thus-formed groups
differ sernantically from the corresponding formations with -me and
reduction. Perhaps such a difference may he found in the following
cases - the only ones in my material - where with the same verbal
This is the case with the formations with -ri (3.1.2.1.), with -:rpo (3.1.3.2.4.),
with -:rto (3.1.3.2.5.), and with -lIeJJ (3.1.3.2.8.). Examples:
1) am wo:)'a~ tïna:rori me 'he killed one, as something that was taken by
him' (i.e. as food for his journey; am wo: J'a~ 'he killed one'); 2) aembo
tuwe:i:po me ro kinï:rsa~ nona:pa 'as soon as he was ready he set off again'
(aembo 'ready', we:i 'to be, become', tu- '3rd pers. refl.', ro 'indeed, quite,
straightway', kinï:rsa~ nOlla:pa 'he set oH again'); 3) mo:rka:ro pita:ni
ne:ne:rtorï me ta:ro ma~ 'whiIe the children could not watch her, she was
abducted' (mo:rka:ro pita:ni 'the children', c:lle 'to see, wateh', ta:ro ma;)
'she was taken, abducted'); 4) kerki ene:/u13 me tï::ye ma?) 'he has been
appointed verger' (kerki 'church', ti:)'e ma~ 'he has been appointed').
23 What it lacks is the separability with regard to other words which is
characteristic of words, in contrast to parts of words. For the reason for
regarding, despite this, postpositions as words and not as suffixes, see 3.3.1.

The occurrenee of the suffix-alternants is partly determined by the
nature of the final phoneme: in notbus with a final nasal the formation
invariably takes place with -nano. E.g. tu:mufj 'mound', tu:muna:no
'mounds in general' ; uwe:tuij 'sleep', uwe:tuna:no 'sleep in general'
Wi.th nouns ending in avowel both altemants occur. It is fairly
certain tJha,t their occurrence is connected with the vocalic structure
of the polymorphematic word: we find that -nano is always preceded
by a short vowel and -'ltla:no by a long vowel. Yet I have only partly
succeeded in finding a mie which, on the basis of the form of the
monomorphematic noun, predicts which of the two altematllts wilt
occur; viz. only for the dissyllabic nouns. In these (1) -nano occurs,
except when (Za) the noun belongs to the type which, when suffixation
occurs, shortens the first vowel and lengthens the second 105, or when
(lb) the noun loses its final syllable when suffixation takes place;
in the last two cases we find -wa:no.
Examples:
1) e:kï 'pet animal', o:kïna:no 'pet animals In general' ; Omo 'egg',
Pmona:no 'eggs in general'.
Za) e:fi 'name', o!i:wa:no 'names in general'.
2b) pïirï 'shyness, shame', pïiwa:no 'general shame, a great scandal'.
On account of my limited material I have not been able to find
a rule applying to trisyllabic nouns:
Cases with -nano, final syllable remains:
pira:ta 'money', pïra:tana:no 'money in general' ; kare:ta 'paper', kare:tana:no 'paper in general'.
Cases with -nano, final syllable is lost:
po:rirï 'shin', po:rina:no 'shins in general' ; axka:rï 'shade, shadow',
axkana:no 'shade, shadow in generai'; uxse:ti 'hair (on head)',uxsena:no 'hair (on head) in general' ; aiya:rï 'hand', aiyana:no 'hands in

In words formed by combination of -xpa and -mbo I found -xpa both
before -mbo and after it. I do not know whether this difference in
order involves any semantic difference.

I have not further investigated the combination of the two processes,
but I would call attention to the possibility that they may be freely
combinable. If only from a semantic point of view (combination of
'generalizing aspect' and 'plurality'), this would be an important datum.
Combination of -nano with personal prefixation, -xpa and -mbo may
he ruled out as impossible.","[265, 266, 267]"
"192THE CARIB LANGUAGEin English. If we define the meaning of kïku:ra:mai always as 'I appeal
to you - either in a positive or in negative sen se - with respect to
looking after me', it would seem possible to conclude that we have
to do with one word, whose meaning may he interpreted either in a
positive sense ('may you look af ter me'), or in a negative sense ('do
not look after me').
There are, however, three arguments against identification. In the
first place there is no complete correspondence between the semantic
correlates of the pcrsonal prefixes in the vetative verbs and the formally correspon<iing prefixes in the optativejaffinnative verbs. As the
following table shows, in the transitive formations with ki- (first line)
there is not much difference between the personal exponent of the
vetrutive and that of the optative-affinnative: the only difference is
that the former, unlike rthe latter, does not seem to have the Ijyoureference as wel! as the youjme-reference. In the case of the formations
with kïsi:- however, there is no correspondence at all: to 'you' (left)
corresponds 'both of us' (right). In the case of the intransitives there

"POSTPOSITIONS3.3.0. INTRODUCTION
The poSitpositions constittlite a small class: my materlal comprises
not more than 31 monomorphematic words that belong to the system
described below. Theyare:

The monomorphematic postpositions, like the monomorphematic
verbs, are never used in isolation. The question whether nevertheless
they ean be accorded word status, is answered positively in a first
section (3.3.1.).
As to the polymorphematic eategories, the grmter part of the
postpositional system shows partial or complete correspondence to
certain parts of the verbal and nominal system.
2. Five personal categories (verbs 3.1.3.2.1., nouns 3.2.2.1.).
3. The reflexive category with as- (confined to the postpositions).
4. The no-category (verbs 3.1.3.2.13., nouns 3.2.2.5.).
5. The plural eategories (verbs 3.1.3.2.9., nouns 3.2.2.4.).
6. The mbo-category (verbs 3.1.3.2.2., nouns 3.2.2.2.).

he subject to any rule. We do find, however, that in the available

loanwords, while -:rto' and -ma were; e.g. areisi 'rice', areisixto 'to supply with rice'; po:si 'kiss', po:sima 'to kiss'.109 It may he concluded
from this that only -xto and -ma are possibly productive suffixes. If
one has to choose between these two, i.t seems most probable to me
that -xto is productive. The reasons are (a) the greater frequency of
-xto in the material, (b) the fact that verbs with -xto formed by
myself were often accepted, and (c) the fact that in at lea:st six
loonwords, where a form from Sranan, clearly recog:nisable as such,
precedes -ma} it is very doubtful whether the latter ever occurs by
itse1f, as a noun. This is the case with: fatJgama 'to receive', kara:rima
'to get finished', pa:sama 'to pass', pïreima 'to pretend something',
ru:ruma 'to spy, tie in wait for', wi:nima 'to win something'. A different
case, however, is po:sima mentioned above, by the side of which po:si
'kiss' does occur. Further investigation will he necessary as to this
problem of productivity. More examples and an enumeration of the
Transpositional suffixation with -ka (in case of final nasal with -ga) is
also found with onomatopoeic and soundsymbolic words; it results in transitive verbs. E.g. ko:ro 'depicts a scrubbing sound', ko:roka 'to scrub, rub,
sweep'; pi:ri 'flash !', pi:rika 'to make glitter, to make shoot sparks';
bO'Jbo"" 'bang bang I' ixsano:ri kïbo'Jbo,!ga:to;j 'its coldness (its, of the rain)
came bang bang down upon us' (ixsano:rï 'its coldness').
109 It should be noted that one of the extremely rare cases with 10) -pa happens
to be a loanword as weil: to:ri 'story', to:ripa 'to teil someone a story'.
The intransitive transposition, too, in fo:ri takes place, not with the regular
-ta, but with -'Wa (3.2.2.7.1.).
108MORPHOLOGY237cases in my material with the infrequent altemants 7-12, will he given
in the discussion of the semantic aspect.
Nouns where the formation of a syntactic category does not, or does
not only, depend on suffix3Ition with -rï or -ru, have the same vowel
in the transposition-category as in the B-category. Also in the case of
irregularities in the syntactic categories, the transpositional categories
always follow the B-category. E.g. A o:ma B e:marï 'path', e:maxto
'to make a p3lth for someone'; A auxto B auxtï 'house', auxtïma 'to
build a house for someone'; A kiye:re B ixkere:ri 'cassava', ixkerexto
'to give someone cassava'.
With regard to the loss of a final syllable ti, ki, ku, rï, or ru, the
situation is probably exactly the same as with the intransitive process
discussed in the last section. In practically all the cases mentioned
there, and in twelve further cases, it was established that they also
lose the final syllable when they are suffixed with -xto. The twe1ve
new cases are: yaxtï 'firewood', yaxto 'to put firewood on fire'; amo:tï
'strap, sling', amoxto 'to provide with astrap, sling'; apu:tï 'cover',
apuxto 'to provide with a cover'; u'lve:tï 'stool', uwe:ka 'to relieve
oneself'; ï:potï 'hair, feathers growing on body', ï:poxto 'to provide with
hair, feathers'; e~we:tï 'fringe', e~wexto 'to provide w~th fringe';
ïmbakï:tï 'lath', ïmbakixka 'to strengthen with laths'; ra:rï 'flat surface',
ra:ka 'to cause something to get flat surfaces' ; anu:ru 'tongue, vibrating
lath on drum-skin', anuxto 'to provide with such a lath'; aiku:ru 'liquid',
aikuxto 'to make liquid'; inda:rï 'mouth', ïndaxto 'to provide with
a mouth, an opening'; axsa:ri 'gutter', axsaxto 'to dig a gutter round
a house'.
Retention of the final syllable ti or rï, as with the intransitive verbs,
was found in a:rï 'foliage, wiek of oil-Iamp', a:rïxto 'to provide with a
wiek'; mo:rï 'noise', mo:rika 'to cause 10 make a noise' ; and also in
e:tï 'name', efi:ka 'to give a name'.
The meaning of the members of the transitive category may be
defined as:
(a) to cause to become,
(b) to make produce, to produce for another,
(c) to give, provide with,
(d) to handle, to apply to something,
that which is designated by the corresponding monomorphematic noun.
I suppose that we are again concerned here with one and the same
semantic distinction, and that it depends on the lexical meaning of238THE CARIB LANGUAGEa noun whether the resulting verb is to be interpreted in terms of a,
b, c or d. As to a, b and c, there is c1ear paralle1ism to the semantic
definition of the intransitive category: we find side by side (a) to
become versus to cause to become, (b) to produce by oneself or for
oneself versus to make produce, to produce for another person, (c) to
obtain versus to give, provide something with something else.
In support of the assumption that there is no semantic difference
among the nine suffix-alternants, even though their occurrence is not
subject to a hard-and-fast rule, as far as possible examples will now
to he given for each alternant which represent all the four semantic
types. For the rare altemants 7-12 all the cases in my material are

classes it should he 110ted that no account has been taken a) of categories of limitted size, i.e. categories that show correlates with only
a small numher of memhers of the other categories helonging to the
same class, and b) of categories which, though occurring in a certain
class, are not in direct correlation with the monomorphematic category.
Without these restrictions a slightly different picture would have
emerged. In a few cases a delimitation would have been brought out
more clearly: thus there is a category of direction with -naka which
is only found with some of the postpositions (class 3) and the adjectives
(class 4), and a caltegory of extent with -ro which is only found with
some postpositions (class 3). As against this, however, it may he said
that the picture of inner coherence would have tended to emerge even
more clearly. It will frequently be found, for instance, that categories
which are productive in one word class also occur in another word
class, but then only in a few isolated cases. Furthermore, the no- and
especially the plural- and the mbo-categories occur in practically all
classes when the restriction of b) above is not made.
Finally it should he noted that the demonstratives and the numerals
are so-called closed classes, i.e. they show a closed system of formalsemantic relations and consequently cannot freely take in new elements. 9
The posltpositions and adjectives, although not closed in this sen se,
nevertheless comprise a relatively small numher of words: in each of
these two classes not more than a few dozen mono-morphematic words
were found. The verbal class far exceeds all the other classes in the
number of its categories. 10910E. M. Uhlenbeck, Word classes, p. 336, 341.
A nwnber of words does not belong to any of the morphological systems, and
will therefore not he discussed here. Further research doubtless will show
that sernantically and syntactically they belong still to a nwnber of different
types. In the word index these words without morphological valenee are
marked with a (P). Apart from proper names and interjections, there are
e.g. words Iike na'nelj 'first', ro 'indeed', ko:ro 'please', ko 'interrogative
particIe'.",[130]
"NOUNSINTRODUCTIONIn the greater part of the nominal system we find either partial or
complete correspondence to certain parts of the - much more extensive - verbal system.
In the first place, agreat many nouns form syntactie categories,
although the rules that apply are for the greater part different from
those applying to verbs (see 3.1.2.).
Secondly, complete or partial similarity to· the verbs is found with
regard to the following morphological categories:
1. Five personal categories, formed with the same prefixes as described for the verbs in 3.1.3.2.1.,
2. The mbo-category (for the verbs, 3.1.3.2.2.),
3. The xpa-category (for the verbs, 3.1.3.2.6.),
4. The plural categories (for the verbs, 3.1.3.2.9.),
5. The no-category (for the verbs, 3.1.3.2.13.).
There are also categories, however, which are confined to the
nominal system:
6. The generalising category with -nano,
7. Two transposition-categories the mernbers of which have the morphological valence of verbs,
8. A transposition-ca.tegory whose members have the morphological
valenee of adjectives.
In a final section it will be shown how the various nominal processes may form further categories by combination with each other.

For mi- in the verbal sySltem, see 3.1.3.2.12.
C) The kepï-category.
Some nouns may be directly suffixed with the aspect-suffix -kepï
'to stop, cease', without a special transposition-suffix being necessary.
The resulting formation has all the properties of a verb. The cases in
my mart:erial are: o:nlt 'eye', enu:kepï 'to he dazzled'; are:pa 'bread',
ere:pake:pï 'to he left without any bread, to run out of bread'; auraij
'speech', aurOlY3gepï 'to stop speaking'; a:ri 'leaf', a:rif3gepï 'to he
stripped of leaves'. I cannot account for the introduction of a nasal in
this last: case. For -kePi in the verbal system, see 3.1.3.1.4.
D) The po-category.",[268]
"58THE CARIB LANGUAGEWith initial x or :> the following clusters were found:
xp
:>m
:>pxt
:>nxkxs
:>w:>y:>rThe cluster :> p was only found in one instance, yu:> pa 'good'. By the
side of yu:>pa the fonus yuxpa and }'u:pa occur with the same meaning,
as far as could be ascertained. Nor is the choice of any of the three
fonus influenced by the speed of speaking.
The other clusters occur, for instance, in the following, monomorphematie words: ambo:tï 'to break', undï 'trunk (of a tree)',
Ït'jga:na 'behind', waijsi:ri 'little bird', ituxpo 'waterpooI', 'li.I(1,X(O' 'fire',
moxko 'he', axsa:ri 'groove, neck', a:>mo 'to begin', a:>na 'we (exclusive)', mani:>wi 'little fish', mo:>ya 'over there', ita:>ro 'really'.
Mention should also he made of the cluster tr, whieh was only found
in the loan-word watrakaij 'jug'.
In the formation of polymorphematic words the only consonant
clustersthat result are the following ten out of the seventeen clusters
mentioned above:
fjg
xkxsTo put it in another way: all affixing takes place in sueh a way
that any sequences of consonants brought about by it are the same
as those thart: occur in non-affixed words. They occur in the following
cases:
A) In prefixing
A nasa! cluster is only found in some polymorphematic words
containing the prefix of the third person, fonued on the basis of the
words 'WÏ:to 'to go' and wï:ka 'to speak'. This prefix, which is kïni:when the base has an initial consonant, kïni:- with loss of the initial
vowe1 when this is ï of ï:, and kïn- when the base has an initial vowel
other than i or ï:, is here kïn-, c.q. kïfj-, with simw'taneous loss of the
sequenee wï: and replacement of tand k with d and g. E.g., kïnd~
'he went' (with -ij), kÏfjga:no 'he says' (with -:no).
The clusters xC and :>C only arise in a few words fonued by means
of the irregular prefix-altemants wox-/wo:>-. E.g. woxka 'to comeTHE STRUCTURE OF THE WORD FORMSS9outside' (on the basis of ka 'to get something ou1'), wo~wo 'to bump
oneself' (on the basis of wo '-to beat').
In all cases other than those mentioned above only prefix aItemants
ending in a vowel are used before consonants, whereas hefore vowels
only prefix alte.rnants ending in a consonant are used. An example
is the prefix of the third person, which we have already discussed.
B) In suffixing
As the clusters occurring ll1 suffixes are identical with those in
monomorphematic words, and as they can only he added to bases
ending in avowel, it goes without saying that the resttlting polymorphematic words do not conJtain any sequences of consonants other
than those mentioned above.
Sequences in which the first consonant belongs to the base, and the
second is part of the suffix also occur. They are brought about in two
ways. Firstly, there are formations from bases with a final consonant,
to which a suffix with initial consonant is added. Secondly, there are
somewhat more complicated processes involving not only suffixing but
also reduction of the base.
BI) Suffixing without reduction
The only consonants occurring 111 final posItIOn are the nasals ij
and tJ. By adding a suffix the clusters nd and t'Jg may arise; e.g. on
the basis of e:ratJ 'guard', se:randoya 'I put a guard there', (cf. with
a vowe1 in final position o:ma 'pa1h', se:maxtoya 'I lay out a pa1h
there'), on 1he basis of auraiJ 'language' , auratJgofJ 'languages' (cf. with
a vowel in final position o:ma 'path', o:mako'ij 'paths').
The chances of finding consonant clusters in this type of polymorphematic words are smaII, because in general final fJ and tJ have
a low frequency; besides, only some of the forms containing these
final nasals admit of suffixation.
B2) Suffixing with reduction
Consonant clusters also arise, however, when to the vast majority 3 of
verbs ending in pï, tï, kï, rï. mï, ku, or ru, or to the verb wï:to 'to go',
3The few instances in which reduction does not take place are all bivocalic:
a:tï 'to clean', kï:rï 'to make', a:tnï 'to build a house', 'Wo:mi 'to enter'. Thereare also bivocalic words, however, where reduction does take place: e.g.
'Wo:pï 'to come', ï:rï 'to give, to place', po:tnï 'to plant'. I have .not been ableto find a rule governing the occurrence or non-occurrence of reduction, in
these cases.","[77, 78, 79]"
"MORPHOLOGICAL CATEGORIES3.2.2.1. THE FIVE PERSONAL CATEGORIESThe five personal prefixations discussed in 3.1.3.2. may he applied
to nouns as well as to verbs. For ,the form of the various prefixalternants and the rules in accordance with whieh they alternate the
reader may he referred to the table at the beginning of 3.1.3.2.1.
All that need be added is a note on the special way in which the
personal processes take place with nouns beginning with i. The phenomenon in question could not possibly be operative in the verbal class
as i does not occur as an initial vowel in monornorphematie verb3.
With nouns having i- the five processes take place as follows:
lst pers.
initial i replaeed by ïi
2nd pers.
initial i replaced by ui
3rd pers.
initial i does not undergo any modification
3rd pers. refl.
initial i replaced by tïi
Ist + 2nd pers. initial i replaced by kïi
As a glance art: the table in 3.1.3.2.1. shows, 0-, tï- and kï- occur as
prefix-alternants. The diphthongs oio (t)ïi and (k)ïi rnay therefore he
regarded as a result of the coalescence of the prefix-vowel with the i
belonging to the noun itself.

Of these two sentences, the one with 4 might be spoken, for instance,
by a vigorous man who is still capable of undertaking long journeys,
while the one with 5 might be u500 by an old man talking about his
youth. Other examples:
4) e:ro po su weiyaine, paxporo :ne no~mato:koij 'I am always in this
same spot, all have left me' 60 (e:ro po 'here', su 'exactly', we:i 'to be',
paxporo :ne no~mato:koij 61 'all have left me') ;
5) ye:ma:miij po:ko weito 'I was all the time busy doing my work'
(ye:ma:miij po:ko 'busy doing my work'; the work was completed before the speech event).
11) The three categories in the third column are semantically more
complicated, and I am not sure that the interpretation given here is
perfectly correct. If I am not mistaken, the two temporal distinctions
of the first column are found here too, together with one and the same
modal value, which is of an affirmativejoptative nature. In certain
usages these categories denote that a) the speaker dedares, finds,
confirms or admits that some event is taking or took place; in other
cases they denote that b) the speaker wishes a certain evellit to take
place.
This modal value and the two temporal distinctions seem, furthermore, to inter-operate to some extent, as we shall see.
On comparing category 6 with the unmarked category 1 (column IA)
we find that the modal distinction can he established without any
difficu1ty, both in its affirmative and in its optative usage:
1) ba:siya me yandï~moyaij 'he appoints me deputy-chief' (ba:siya me
'as deputy-chief', andl1~mo 'to appoint'),
6) ba:siya me yandïhlI.oi (a) 'he really has appointed me deputy-chief',(b) 'may he appoint me deputy-chief'.
When, however, we include 7 in the comparison, we find an important difference between the optaltive (b) and the affirmative (a) usages.
In the case of an optative interpretation of 6 and 7, there is no
temporal difference to be discerned between these two categories,
whereas in the case of an affirmative interpretation the same temporal
difference emerges as was found between 2 and 1.
The speaker is a young man who has been left in the village all by himself
and is not allowed to leave it; the hearer is his first visitor after a long time.

First example, aHinnative use (a):
6) ba:siya me yanáf.~moi 'he has really appointed me deputy-chief'
7) ba:siya me yanánmo-ij 'he really appointed me deputy-ohief then'.
Second example, optative use (b):
6) kari~na am so:noi 'may I eat an lndian' (kari~na am 'an lndian',
o:no 'to eat').
7) upuxpo sewi:riwi:rika-ij 'may I pluck all the hair off his head'
(upuxpo 'his head', wi:riwi:rika 'to pluck off a person's hair').
These two sentences were used by two colibris for the purpose of
sca.ring an lndian who has lost: his way. There is nothing to show
any temporal or other difference caused by the use of a member of 6
or 7.
Third example, affirmative use (a):
6) mo:pïi? a:a wo:pïi 'so, you have come?' 'yes, I have come' (wo:pï
'to rome', a:a 'yes'),
7) paki:ra po:ko wo~ne'tJ 'I admit that I came then because of a peccary' (Paki:ra po:ko 'because of a peccary').
In these cases a (temporal) difference can be established again: the
sentences with 6 are commonly exchanged by way of greeting immediaJtely after a person's arrival, whe,reas by using the sentence with 7
the speaker, a huntsman who had lost his way, admitted a day after
his arrival that, as a result of his chasing a peccary, he had landed up
in the village of these animals.
A third modal category, 8, is distinct from 6 by the presence of
the value 'future'. Examples:
8) nimo:ku ewaxtoto:ko ï:rato ro. i:ya ro:te1j su:ropo:tï:se 'string up
a hammock next to mine. let me blow a little on her here and there'
(i:ya ro:teij 'a little', u:ropo:tï 'to blow on a person here and there';
a medicine-man is talking about his patient),
8) etu.'wa:romako ko:koro wara:ro eku:piko. po:to karOna me:i:se
'take good care of yourself, take a bath with herbs every morning. so
that you may lalter becorne a big man' (pa:U() kari~na 'a big man',
we:i 'to become').
The fact that in this category the differenee between affirmative and
optative usages is considerably less obvious than was the case in 6 and 7MORPHOLOGY179may very weIl he due to its combination with the value 'future': the
positlive statement that something is going to happen (a), and the
wish for something to happen (b), ean more easily be put under a
common denominator by the investigart:or than the positive statement
that something has happened (a) and the wish for something to happen,
which implies that it has not yet happened.lIl) The last column of the table contains a fourth modal category, 9.
Whereas by means of the categories in II the speaker coo.firms the
occurrence of a certain event or states it as desirabIe, he indicates
by using 9 that, according to him, the event does not take place or
cannot possibly take place. Combination with the two temporal distinctions is lacking here. Examples:
9) imï:pofixpa yaiya:n neirï, siwo:rï era:pa 'if my hands were not
tied on all sides, I would deal him a return blow' (imï:potïxpa 'not
tied on all sides', yaiya:rï 'my hands', wc:i 'to he', wo 'to strike, beat',
era:pa 'back') ;
9) o:'U.!e ko sepo:rï 'where could I have found it?' (o:we ko 'where ?'.
epo:n 'to find', ,the senrence is a reaction to the question o:we ko
mepo:rïi 'where did you find it ?').

"THE CATEGORIES WITH -xto, mï-, -kepï, -po, as-These five categories have so far not been mentioned. As they occur
only a few .times in my material and as attempts to obtain more cases
failed, I suspect that these are processes which, at any rate in the
nouns, are unproductive; in the verbal system, -xto, mï- and -kepï are
definitely productive, and as- is productive with the postpositions.
My researches on this point have not been thorough enough, however,
so that a further check will he necessary; especially with regard to
-xto and mi-.
A) The xto-category.",[267]
"250THE CARIB LANGUAGEimpossible in the case of analogous construetions with a noun for their
second memher (3.2.1.2.), but unlike the analogous verbal eonstructions where this possibility was fotmd to exist (3.1.1.).
Arguments for the view that, in spite of this, postpositions are
words can he found in .their analogy with the verbs and especially in
the fact th3lt they fully conform to the morphonologica1 rules for the
vowel strueture of words. As to the first point, the postpositions are
subject to prefixing in exaetly the same way as verbs, the result being
forms whieh in both classes show all the properties of words (3.1.3.2.1.,
and 3.3.2. helow). Compare, e.g.:
(A) moxko pita:ni ku:pi 'bathing the ehild' (B) aku:pi 'bathing you'
with:
(A) moxko pita:ni wa:ra 'like the ehild', (B) awa:ra 'like you'.
Since ku:pi (in A) was found to he a word, we assume the sanle for
the postposition wa:ra in the parallel eonstruetion. That we do have
parallelism here is eonfirmed by the two words in B with an analogous
strueture.
With regard to the argument based on the morphonological strueture of the postpositions it must first of all he admitted that the postposition ~wa 'to, by', because of its initial cluster, looks more like a
suffix than a word. We have already seen, however, that there are
:two more exeeptions to the rule whieh excludes a cluster in initial
position: the enclitics ~ne 'really' and -rl?uru 'formerly', both showing
the mobility within the sentenee held to he characteristie for words
(2.1.2.1.1. and 2.3.). What settles the matter for me, however, is
the fact that all postpositions conform to the vocalie strueture rules
for words. Two kinds of phenomena are involved: contrary to what
happens in the process of suffixing, a con1bination with, for instance,
ta never affects the vocalie strueture of the preceding word; and,
untike sequences of suffixes, the products of suffixing of ta, ete. always
take the kind of vocalic structure found in words. Some examples may
illustrate this.
When, e.g., wotu:rupo 'to ask' is suffixed with causative -po, in
accordance with a general rule (2.1.3C1.) lengthening of the fourth
vowel occurs in ,the resulting word: wotu:rupo:po 'to cause to ask'.
Further suffixing does not produee any new quantitative modifications:
wotu:rupo:poya1j 'he causes me to ask', wotu:rupo:poyakoij 'he eaused
me to ask'. Nowa strueture with three short vowels, as in the fragment
-poyakoij, is not found in any tri-vocatie word.
The situation is COOlpletely different when ta is placed after a wordMORPHOLOGY251eontaining four voweIs; there is no question of the vowel before ta
heing lengthened: kuri:yara ta 'in a boat'. And when ta is subjected
to further suffixing lengthenings occur resulting in vocalie structures
such as are found in words: kuri:yara ta:no 'what is in a boat', kuri:yara ta:nokofj 'who, which are in a boat', kuri:yara ta:noko:nïmbo 'who,
which were in a boot'.
The same thing is found in polysyllabie postpositions. Suffixing of,
for instanee, wotu:rupo with -take produees wotu:rupo:take 'I shall
ask', with regularly lengthened foul1th vowel; 115 cf. kure:wako wa:ra
'like a green parrot' , without modifieation in the first word, kure:wako
wa:rano 'one that is like a green parrot', kure:wako wa:rano:ko1J 'those
that are like a green parrot' .
3.3.2. THE F1VE PERSONAL CATEGOR1ES

3.3.3. THE as-CATEGORY
The members of this category are formed by prefixation with:
1) ase:2) asThe first is the case when the monomorphematic word begins with
a consonant or with i, the second when it begins with avowel other
than ï. The first altemant is placed before a consonant, but replaces
initia! ï.
Examples:
1) po:na 'against', ase:po:na 'against each other'; ï13ga:na 'behind',
aset'jga:na 'behind each other'.
2) apo:rito 'beside', asa:po:rito 'beside each other'.
Beside regular ase:ta 'in each other' (ta 'in') occurs ase:na, as far
as I could tell, with exactly the same meaning.
The meaning of the members of the category can he defined as 'the
mutual applicability to ,two persons or objects, or tbe applicability
to one person or object wiiI:h regard to him/itself, of what the monomorphematic postposition designates'. Cf. apo:rito kino:tandOmoyafj
'he is sitting beside him', with asa:po:rito kïno:tancii~moya:tofj 'they
sit next to each other'; i:ke kini:ka:safj 'he is making it with it', ase:ke
kïni:ka:safj 'he is making it himself'.
3.3.4. THE no-CATEGORY
The members of this category are formed by suffixation with:
1) -no
2) -13253MORPHOLOGYThe fonner is the case when the monomorphemaJtic word ends in 0
or a, the latter when it ends in e. 116 Before -tJ, e is replaced by a.
Examples:
1) po 'at', po:no 'somebody or something in a certain place'; eko:sa
'at, with', eko:sano 'somebody or something staying with someone else'.
2) me 'as, serving as', ma13 'somebody, something serving as'.
The meaning of the memhers of the category can he defined as
'person or object to whom/which applies what the corresponding
monomorphematic word designates' . Cf. para:muru po mafj 'he is at
Paramaribo', with para:mum po:no moxko ma1j 'he is an inhabitant of
