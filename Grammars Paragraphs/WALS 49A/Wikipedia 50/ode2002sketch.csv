"6 Nouns
Nouns are of the following types: simple nouns, compounds, alienable and inalienable
nouns. Nouns referring to human beings are marked for gender. Nouns have possessive
inflection by means of bound pronouns prefixed to inalienable nouns and by means of the
subject prefixed verb tar or bi 'to possess' preceding the alienable noun. Nouns as head of
noun phrases can be modified by adjectives, numerals and demonstratives following the
noun. Loans are predominantly from neighbouring languages: Numforese, Irianese Malay or
Standard Indonesian, but also from Dutch. Since loans do not behave differently from
original Mpur words, they will not be further discussed.",[16]
"2 Phonology
Mpur is a language with lexical tone contrasts. To my knowledge it is, together with the
neighbouring Abun language (Berry & Berry 1 999), the only Non-Austronesian tone
language in the Bird's Head area.
A detailed phonology of Mpur by G. Kalmbacher is in preparation, of which a draft
(Kalmbacher 1 996) was kindly offered to me by the author. The data presented here do not
necessarily agree with all data in Kalmbacher's phonology. This is especially the case with
respect to word stress and the tone system, but differences will not be discussed. Full
responsibility for this short phonology is mine.",[4]

criminal6.4 Alienable nouns
There are two possessive pronouns which are used with alienable nouns. Both -tar and -bi
always precede the noun. The possessive morpheme bi is identical to the Abun form (see
Berry & Berry 1 999:78). Examples of alienable nouns in a context with possessive pronouns
are presented below:(67)In-unsi n-tarjan.","[16, 17, 18]"
"4.3 Verb sequences
Sequences of verbs are a common phenomenon in Mpur. They occur without any
conjunction and all verbs in such a sequence are finite and thus obligatorily inflected.
There are a few criteria according to which sequences of verbs in Mpur actually could be
cases of verb serialisation: conjunctions do not occur between the verbs, a clause boundary
occurs only after the last verb, the subject is the same for all verbs, verbs may also occur
individually in a clause, verbs form together a prosodic group (no pauses between verbs, a
single intonation contour). Three examples are:(27)Do-undo-mimdo-fasubweAri-a a-tem.",[11]
"Cecilia Ode523 Pronouns
3.1 Free and bound pronouns
Mpur has free and bound pronouns. Bound pronouns are subject markers prefixed on
verbs and possessor markers prefixed on inalienable nouns. The free and bound forms are
presented below with an example on a prefixed verb and on an inalienable noun:

HE will go home.
(3)Ntonjan.
housenan an-jap.child 2S0 2S0-stay

Personal free pronouns are used as verbal or prepositional object, without special
emphasis, as in (4) and (5):
(4)A -fromnan.","[7, 8]"
"(85)N-kurem mamer a-tatherebwan mumdo-y-aw.
3DU-Y-runmek.deep there
3SF-enter k.o.tree 3SM-ANA hole
She went inside the deep hole of that mamer tree.
The forms (n-)ka and (n-)ki and mek can be specified further with elements from textual
deictics and other forms. This is discussed below.
Textual deixis is indicated by anaphoric ta and focus/topic marking ni, the latter most
likely of Numforese origin. Both can be prefixed with a- or ba-. For the time being, I
interpret a as '3SM ' ; but note that the origin of ba- seems to be bar 'thing', where intitial b- is
often omitted. The forms ba-ta, a-ta and ba-ni, as well as a number of more complex forms
(see below), occur equally frequently in my materials. A focus-marking form a-ni is in a
single case attested. Anaphoric ta can also be found in the free personal pronoun yeta '3SM'.
Sometimes ta is followed by a semivowel /w/: taw. The form nda 'that/there' does not occur
without n in my materials; it can also be followed by a final semivowel /w/: ndaw. A form
da is only attested with the meaning 'first, earlier', and as such is related to anaphoric ta o It
seems likely that nda consists of n '3SF' and anaphoric ta, where the initial stop is voiced
after n.
Examples of textual deictics are presented in the following examples:(86)Mamir mautbiasaa-tade-kum.person REL dead 3SM-ANA usually 3PL-smoke
The people who are dead they usually smoked.",[21]
"14 Classifiers
Mpur has a large number of classifiers that are obligatory in combination with numerals
which they precede. Though I don't know their exact number, I found over twenty different
classifiers. For example, bik for counting houses andfi for counting persons and animals:(226)janbikdenurhouse CLF three
three houses(227)ntonfirokir

testicles1 5 Relativisation and the form ma
The form rna is observed in various languages of the Bird's Head area. Reesink
( 1 998:626ff.) discusses the different functions of mao To supplement his article I present
some other functions which rna has in Mpur, in addition to sections 7- 1 0 where the form has
also been discussed.
My informants indicated that preposition rna 'at, to' and ma as relative marker have
different tones: high tone and mid tone, respectively. I analysed many examples of rna and
found that in both functions the tone realised in context fluctuates considerably; pronounced
in isolation I did not find any difference in tone: both were realised with mid tone. The form
is so frequently used, that a discrete difference in tone would have been noticed.
For the time being, the different rna, which, in spite of native speakers' judgements, are
considered homophonous, to be distinguished are:
(a)as relative marker, introducing relative clauses;(b)as relative marker in Headless RC, resembling a nominalising particle;(c)on attributive adjectives in RC;A sketch ofMpur
(d)as marking demonstratives;(e)in question words (examples (244}-(246));(f)as preposition (example (247)).","[39, 40, 41]"

the child and the dog10 Spatial orientation
In addition to the rather general locative prepositions, discussed in ยง9, Mpur employs a
number of spatial relator nouns to specify the spatial orientation of an object. Some of these
are clearly nouns in their own right, such as bwan 'hole', others transparently refer to body
parts, such as dir 'rib', again others can be classified as nouns, because they occur as object
of the preposition be. This preposition has not been discussed in ยง7, since it is rather
restricted to locative phrases with or without spatial nouns. Some spatial nouns are included
in this category on the basis of analogy to the items mentioned. That is, if a noun referring to
an object which serves as spatial anchoring point is present, the spatial nouns either followA sketch ofMpur 73
that noun directly, as in (1 50), or with an additional instance of the preposition be, as in( 1 5 1 ).

"48Cecilia Ode1 .2 A personal note
The present article is a sketch of Mpur. The main aim of my research was an experimental
phonetic study of prosody in Bird's Head languages, more specifically of Mpur and Abun.
Because of the time-consuming character of such studies, morphology and syntactics did not
get the attention it deserved. A description of Abun has recently been published (Berry &
Berry 1 999), but Mpur is still mostly a blank spot on the language map of the Bird's Head.
A phonology (Kalmbacher 1 996, MS), a limited wordlist and some other works have been
written by G. and C. Kalmbacher. Though a full description of the Mpur language was never
my intention, I nevertheless collected enough data to undertake the challenge of writing this
article, largely encouraged to do so by my fellow researchers. Yet quite a few issues remain
insufficiently described or explained, and in some cases that is even an understatement.
H owever, since I do have quite a bit of data from the language and since it is unlikely that
anyone else will study the language in detail soon, I have decided to present an analysis of
what I have collected so that the language will not remain completely undocumented except
for its phonetics.
Data for this article were collected during three periods of fieldwork in 1 99 3-94, 1 995
and 1 998 in the Kebar valley and in Amberbaken. Apart from the work by G. and C.
Ka1mbacher mentioned above, which became accessible to me only later, no data on the
Mpur language were available. I worked intensively with Amanda Ajoi and Seppy Wabia in
Anjai, the Kebar Valley, and in Saukorem, Amberbaken, with Seppy Wabia, Markus Wabia,
Moses Warijo and a few other people. Twice I met the Kalmbachers in Kebar and discussed
many Mpur issues with them. For a study of the three dialects I visited lenderau (East
Kebar) and Nekori (over the mountains behind Jenderau) and along the Amberbaken coast
the villages from Arfu to Wau. In all areas mentioned I worked with indigenous inhabitants
of the villages and recorded their speech on tape.
This article reflects the limitations explained above and will mainly present word classes,
morphological processes and, where this seems adequate, some syntactic information.","[3, 4]"
"6.7 Nouns with the same form as verbs
A number of nouns in Mpur have the same form as verbs with subject prefixation. For
example sor 'mountain/cross' and tum 'arrow/shoot' :(74)In-sordok.",[19]
"3SM-child-CL CLF-two 3PL-wait impossible 3PL-wait impossible already
His two children could not wait, they could not wait anymore.
As the following example shows, Mpur words from other word classes can be used as a
verb without the verbaliser bi- simply by taking subject prefixation:
(33)kum smokede-kum-athey smoke him4. 5 Causative verbal prefix faMpur makes use of a verbal prefix, which is most likely of Numforese origin indicating a
causative, for instance fa-ur 'to extinguish' consisting of the causative fa- and the adverb ur
'extinguished'. Fa- can be prefixed to words from different word classes making it a
transitive verb. Some examples are:A sketch of Mpur 57

to argue (lit. cAus-kill-RECIP)
to turn around, to capsizeIn a number of cases I do not know the origin of the stem of the transitive verb, for
instance fa-wop 'to close'. Note that Taba (South Halmahera) has ha-op CAUS-be covered 'to
cover' (John Bowden, pers. comm.). Some verbs like farkor 'to learn' and f(a)nander 'to
forget' are wholesale borrowings from Numforese (note that the vowel a of fa- is often
omitted).","[12, 13]"
"6.8 Nouns and word order

"There are no indigenous words for ' week', 'month' or 'year'. Mpur speakers use
I ndonesian words, but for 'year' the compound bra-n-ka-wa is sometimes used, from
classifier bra for long things, demonstrative pronoun n-ka '3SF-that' and aspect adverb pa

"Anja16 Clitics
Clitics are monosyllabic morphemes attached to lexical words of different classes, but
usually not on prepositions. Clitics are meaningful elements and in Mpur frequently have a
salient intonation and syllable lengthening. All clitics are enclitics which modify a word, a
clause or a whole utterance. The interrogative clitic -e is discussed separately in ยง7. The
same form is used with an apparently different function. The other clitics -a, -i, -0 function
in discourse as, for instance, vocatives, continuation, focus and temporal markers, as
expression of (emotive) emphasis. It is hard to tell the different meanings of the clitics apart,
and I did not study the issue thoroughly enough to explain the differences. Working on the
translations of texts, Mpur informants were often unable to indicate what a given clitic
means. Despite this some examples are presented below.
Clitic -a occurs as a vocative for persons: nen-a! 'Mum-voc!'. It is used to call someone
who is not far away (otherwise -0 is used, see below):A sketch of Mpur 87

"3.2 Reflexivity
Reflexivity is expressed by means of free pronouns. It can be emphasised by do 'self,
alone', which has subject prefixation and often occurs in combination with numeral tu 'one'
to express exclusivity. Examples of the two expressions of reflexivity are:
( 1 0)In-tik-warin.",[9]
"( 1 57)Maria-n
n-jut
tu
Maria-3SF 3SF-rasp coconut
Maria rasps coconut outside.be-yeo
Loc-outsideThere are a number of spatial nouns which can only follow the anchoring noun when they
themselves are marked with the preposition be. The whole locative phrase may be governed
by either be or by the locative prepositions ku 'to/at', ma 'in, at' and pu 'to/at.far.away' and si
'to'. Note that at the moment of speaking in such constructions instead of locative be, the
locative preposition ku 'to/at' expresses absence, ma presence. For example, in ( 1 58) and
( 1 59), instead of be, ma would have the aspectual meaning 'still present', and ku 'not present
anymore' (see also ยง9).
Spatial nouns are shown in the following examples:74Cecilia Ode

3SM-dead-CLAccording to my informants the forms ma-n-ki and ma-n-ka rather than n-ki and n -ka
are used to refer to something that has not been communicated yet. For example in the
phrase ni ma-n-ki 'this tree', 'tree' is new information, whereas in ni n-ki 'this tree', the
existence of the tree was already known to the listener. Informants are not consistent in their
explanations; this has to be checked further. For a discussion about the many puzzling
functions of ma the reader is referred to ยง 1 5 .
Next to (n-)ka 'there' a form mek 'there' exists. This demonstrative seems t o be used for
distances more remote than (n-)ka . Two examples are:(84)Do-tekkane(k)-mekarwar mek3DU-down that down-there stairs

There are reasons for positing a separate word class of adjectives distinct from either
verbs or nouns, although Mpur adjectives do have some similarities with Mpur verbs. Both
verbs and adjectives take subject prefixation in predicative position. In attributive position
verbs require the relativiser ma following the noun and preceding the prefixed verb.
Adjectives in attributive position occur with and without the relativiser mao
Some examples of adjectives, including the five terms for colours, are:(52)bapak

white), dapraw and bwa-bin (lit. ripe-leaf). Colours can be further specified by using the
adverbs dera or pit 'bright' which are only used for colours and by berep 'light' and dim
'dark', which all follow the name of the colour. The word for azure, for instance, is bwawop
dera 'bright green ' and the word for 'pink' is sum berep. To indicate the intensity of a
colour, the adverbs ten 'just' and tati, kaku 'very' are used: sum ten 'reddish', sum tati 'very
red'.
Adjectives follow the noun and can be specified with relative marker ma as shown in (53).
The relative marker ma occurs on attributive adjectives as in (53), but also introduces relative
clauses and occurs as relative marker in Headless RC. For a further discussion of ma seeยง1 5.

"7 Deictics
I n Mpur a distinction exists between spatial and textual deictics, the forms of which occur
in combinations as summarized in Table 4. As we will see, the deictic system is not a simple
issue at all. As said in my introduction, research carried out for the present article was
limited and does not answer many questions I still have, and the examples shown in this
section leave us with a great deal of uncertainty. Table 4 presents the forms of deictics:

is not indicated in Table 4. Note that the form ba-ni is used in Amberbaken and, according
to my Kebar consultant, equivalent to the Kebar form ka-ni.
Spatial deictics are expressed by the basic demonstrative pronouns ki 'here/this' and ka
'there/that' referring, respectively, to a distance near and a distance further away from the
speaker. The demonstratives are illustrated in the following example:(80)Ah n-bwar kananpan-bwarkian-bwar jan.ah I SG-say that you already I SG-say this 2SG-say
Ah, I already told you, I said don't you say anything.notThe basic demonstratives ki and ka are frequently prefixed by what is likely the
morpheme n '3SF'. They are shown in three nominal clauses:(8 1 )Baban n-ka?",[20]

intonation alone, question-marking clitic -e is realised with a salient, large rising or falling

elements of spatial and textual deictics. The demonstratives ki, ka and mek can be further

for', and they can be suffixed with topic/focus marker ni. All these forms can occur as
object of a preposition. The combinations are shown in the examples below:(9 1 )Seluruh yenba-ta-mekn-ketetsik.all

1.1 Background of the Mpur language
Mpur is a Non-Austronesian language with three lexical tones and is spoken by
approximately 5 ,000 speakers in the north east Bird's Head area, Irian Jaya, Indonesia. In
the literature Mpur is sometimes referred to as Kebar or Amberbaken, which are geographic
names for the two regions where it is spoken.
Mpur is a phylum-level isolate with dialectal differences in at least lexicon and prosody
between speakers in the Kebar Valley, in the mountains (East Kebar) and on the coast
(Amberbaken), respectively. The lexicon is of Papuan origin, but morphology and syntax
show Austronesian features (Reesink 1 998 :603ff.), such as subject-verb-object word order
and the absence of heavy verb morphology. Many loans entered Mpur from Numforese,
Irianese Malay, Standard Indonesian, and also some from Dutch. I ndonesian is taught in
village schools by non-Mpur teachers, but they play truant as much as Mpur children do. In
town Mpur children learn I ndonesian more properly and only they are fairly able to
distinguish between Indonesian and Mpur words. Only a few Mpur speakers are literate in
Mpur, though much progress has been made in Kebar since G. and C. Kalmbacher (Irian Jaya
Bethany Foundation and Summer Institute of Linguistics) began to give literacy courses with
educational materials in the villages of that area; literacy in Indonesian is much better.
Speakers of Mpur do not know the origin of the name Mpur. Coastal Mpur speakers refer
to Mpur speakers in the Kebar Valley as ma-ye 'who are outside' (lit. REL-outside), that is, at
the other side of the eastern Tamrau mountains. Kebar people call Papuan people maksam,
most likely from mam-kesam 'person from Irian' (lit. person-big.forest), in contrast to matem
'white people' from mam-war-tem 'person-mouth-river'. So far I have no explanation for the
term Mpur which is only used to refer to the language.
The Mpur-speaking community has been extensively described by Miedema ( 1 9 84) and
many examples of their oral tradition have been published in M iedema ( 1 997). The story
Kaman ja 'Squash seeds', for the first time presented in this article, is an old story but a new
item to Miedema's collection.","[1, 2, 3]"
"1 1.8 To be or be not: the presentative mu
The presence or existence of something is expressed by the presentative mu with verbs like
ut 'to stay', i 'to stand', jap 'to sit' or kon 'to lie, sleep'. The word class it belongs to is not80Cecilia Odeclear to me, so for the time being the presentative is discussed in this final section on adverbs.
The most frequent use is in combination with the verb ut 'to stay' forming the compound
construction umu and with the demonstratives ka 'that.there' and ki 'that.here'. Mu is always
preceded by a verb. Though its use is not yet clear to me, the presentative is shown in a few
examples:(205)pa.mu-kia-IFentor-aFentor-3SM 3SM-stand present-here already
Fentori is here already.","[35, 36]"
"4.7 Emotive verbs with waThere are a number of verbs expressing mental or physiological states with the initial
syllable wa-, mostly for negative feelings such as warmor 'to be angry', wanaw 'to be afraid',
wafnem 'to be lazy', waka 'to be jealous', wamar 'to be tired', wandar 'to be shy', wantek 'to
be ill '. The verb mom (see ยง4.6) also occurs with wa-: wamom 'to want not'. I have no
explanation yet for the origin of wa-. According to my language consultants the form wa
comes from wow 'body' or mwan 'face, appearance', for instance: wamar 'to be tired'
consists of wow-mar 'body-tired', wantek 'to be ill ' is claimed to be mwan-tek 'face-hot'.
Two examples are:58Cecilia Ode

"11 Adverbs
On the basis of meaning and function, adverbs can be subdivided into types of location,
time, aspect, mode and negation. Adverbs do not take prefixes or suffixes and occur in
clause-initial and/or in clause-final position. Adjectives such as mambom 'lazy', frenkak
'wrongly', mafun 'beautifully' etc., can be used adverbially, as can NPs, like put manki 'day
this' for 'today' . Examples are:(1 69)A-mambom a-tum
