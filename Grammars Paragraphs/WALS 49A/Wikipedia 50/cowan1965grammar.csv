"In the last category two types can be distinguished:
(a)
the two roots are different, the first of them indicating a movement and each being inflected differently, in which case the compound
denotes a sequence of events ;
(b) the two roots are the same; this is the case of repetition of root
forms indicating the gerund.",[26]
"The no.I series, which is probably composed with the emphatic
particle je, contains the stressed absolute forms of the personal pronoun.
The no. IT forms are at the same time the indifferent absolute forms
of the personal pronoun used as subject, the personal forms used with
postpositions, and the possessive forms. In quick speech they may
be abbreviated to d-, w-, etc. before vowel, except for the 1°* p. du., pl.
incl. and excl. No. III is a strongly stressed possessive, also used asabsolute (substantive) possesive (Eng.“mine, yours”), and hence asa kind of reflexive (Eng. “myself, yourself”). It is sometimes abbreviated to de, we, etc. The 3"" p, is also used sometimes as a demonstrative; and this may be the case also for na of the II series, if at
least na, na in the abstract nouns of ITI.2.1 and in certain adverbialexpressions as na-huwe, “in the evening(s)” (cf. huwe, “evening”’) ;
na-denijaj, “in the night(s)” (cf. denijaj, “night’”), and others (cf. V. 8),
must be regarded as demonstrative and not as possessive. The no. IV
series lastly represents a toneless proclitic possessive, which is often,
thoughnotnecessarily,abbreviatedto d-,w-etc.beforevowel,butwhich is not a prefix, and is not essentially different from no, II

in general use and is probably a dialectal form adapted to this specialized end
under Austronesian influence. For in the closely related Tanah Merah language
the unique form for the 1** p.du., pl, both inclusive and exclusive, is ee,
while it is mi, me in Nafri. Also in the inflected forms of the verb there is
not a single trace of separate inclusive and exclusive 1** p.du., pl. forms. The
series II type of this pronoun (e) is put between brackets because I have
never met it in actual usage, while my informants were divided in their
opinions on the point.",[24]
"There are ten types of subordinative combination of words: (1) noun
and nominal attribute (noun); (2) noun and noun in paratactical apposition ; (3) noun and nominal attribute (adj ective, including numerals) ;
(4) noun (including gerund) and pronominal attribute ; (5) noun and
verbal attribute; (6) adjective and adverbial attribute; (7) adverb and
adverbial attribute; (8) verb and adverbial attribute; (9) verb and object
or goal; and (10) combination of types (1) and (4) to form possessive
phrases.
In type (1) the attribute precedes the head, and the function is that
of a generalized relation of possession or origin. We have already briefly
mentioned this type in III.2.2 on borderline cases; e.g., aka’la obo,“jungle (i.e. wild) pig”; joku falam, “dog’s head” ; ondofolo fa, “chief’schild” ; ondofolo i’fa, “‘chief’s canoe” ; etc. The attribute may be accompanied by the postposition le ~ de, “with”, to indicate a possessive
relation in the sense of “having something on or with one”. The
attribute in this case is itself a (postpositional) phrase, e.g., ondofolole fola, “the chief’s bow-and-arrow”(that he has with him); Dasim58GRAMMAROF THE SENTANILANGUAGEKalawbew de omi, “D.K.’s daughter” (whom he has with him) ; ne-waw
de joku, “his uncle’s dog”; joku le falam, “the dog’s head” ; etc.
In type (2) the apposition follows the head, a slight pause intervening,eg., ney jo da awojdeHubulewJawbe-joda AbalaJakali nej —a bala-jo — da; “they both went to their own villages, H. to Jawbe
village (and) Jakali of Sbala to his — the Obalo village’; Ajokoj— Dasim Kalawbew de omi — ake kolukawna, “A. — D.K.’s daughter —went (and) held him”; etc.","[65, 66]"
"In the foregoing chapters certain subjects of a semi-syntactical nature
have been mentioned because they were marginal features showing
points which are reminiscent of both morphology and syntax, or because
they were necessary for a good understanding of morphological phenomena. In the latter category belongs, for instance, the discussion
in III. 4.4 on the aspectual value of tenses, which was necessary for
understanding the nature of what I have named the aspectual affixes.
In the former belong discussions on borderline cases, such as those
in III. 2.2 and III. 4. 11. Interpenetration of levels cannot always be
avoided in a complicated language as Sentani. In this chapter on Syntax
such features will be touched upon again, but only to the extent that
is necessary. Thus the discussion on borderline cases will only be
mentioned in passing, when giving examples of syntactic constructions
concerned therein, but the question of aspect and tense, which was
only briefly mentioned in III. 4.4, will be gone into in much greater
detail when giving examples of the distinctions between them, and
their use in the sentence.
V.2.",[59]
"In the foregoing sections we have mentioned several types of words
with the distinctive names of the traditional parts of speech. These
distinctions are obviously based on structural, morphological and
syntactical, features, characteristic for them, which will be clear enough
from the examples cited. But on some points further explanation and
justification seems necessary. It will be clear, for instance, that the
verb is characterized as such by its flexion; that the noun and the
adjective are distinguished from each other by their different syntactic
positions in word subordination with another noun; the demonstrative
pronoun from the adjective by its similar syntactic position as the
noun’s, and the personal pronoun from the noun by its pseudo-flexionof “genetive”(possessive) forms through apophony.",[69]
"NotablyThe “adverb” has no specific characteristics to distinguish it fromthe noun or the adjective. Often nouns can function as adverbial
expressions, e.g., huwe, “evening, afternoon”, but also “in the evening” ;makaj, “manner, way”, but also “apparently” ; etc. Similarly adjectives
may function as adverbs, e.g., nahinki, “sufficient(ly)”. The syntacticposition of the “adverb” as attribute to the adjective is not different
from that of the adjective to the noun. But many “adverbs” occur
only as such, i.¢., as attributes to adjectives or verbs, and never occur
as adjectives to nouns nor as nouns themselves, e.g., nahi’bi, “promptly,
suddenly, further”; manam, “still, yet”; ba, “only, just’; mo, “id.”;bamo, “id.” ; bamba, “exceedingly, violently” (bam, “not” + ba, “only,
a little’); mana, “to-day”; wena, “yesterday”; wahena, “tomorrow” ;
etc. Some are apparently formed with a preposed na or na, which may
be none other than the 3"" p.s. pronoun as a possessive or a demon-strative (cf. III.2.1
evenings”;na denijaj,and III.3.1),eg., na-hu’we,“in the evening,“in the night, of nights” ; and possibly also theexample already mentioned, nahi’bi. Others seem to be distinguished
by repetition, e.g., dala wahawowmi, nahinki-hinkt jejwowmi, “he dealt
out to them goods, sufficiently he gave to them” ; but bele nahinkt bamo,
“that (was) just sufficient”. But in such cases the repetition may62GRAMMAROF THE SENTANILANGUAGErepresent intensity rather than adverbial quality. Also many “adverbs”
seem to have an irregular stress, notably final stress even when the
word ends in a vowel, eg., na-hu’we, “in the evening’, cf. ’huwe,
“evening”, with normal stress; nahi’bi, “suddenly”; and with both
irregular final stress and repetition wa’la-wa’la, “quickly”. But, as we
have seen (III. 2) repetition is found in several adjectives as well; and
irregular final stress also occurs in other words. Yet the latter seemsto be more frequent in such “adverbs”.
As to syntactic position in relation with the verb, the relative freedom
of the “adverb” as compared with other attributive word-types is
certainly a specific feature, cf. the examples cited: nahi’bi duwawoke,“suddenly it sank”; but also dowke nahi’bi, “she took suddenly”. All
evidence taken together, I feel justified in regarding the adverbs as
a separate part of speech, although it must be admitted that its distinctive features are not very pronounced.
The “numerals” I have included in the adjectives. But a different
interpretation is, for some historically at least, equally possible. The
lower numerals 1-4 are, as far as we can judge at present, independent
words: ambaj, “1”; be, “2”; name, “3”; kali, “4”. They follow the
noun to which they refer and therefore can be classed as adjectives.
But if the construction of noun plus numeral is taken as a subordinative
combination of type (1) in section V. 7 (noun plus noun), these numerals
can also be regarded as nouns, meaning “unit”; “pair”; etc. And
certainly nouns are, historically at least, the higher “numerals” which
appear to be formed with names of parts of the body, eg., mahambaj
(< mafe ambaj,“onehand-palm’’),“5”;mahinaambaj,“6”;whichare derivational and partly derivational partly syntactical respectively(cf. III. 2.1 and V.6); ma be, “10” (lit. “2 hands”); ma be odo fe
ambaj, “15” (lit. “2 hands, one footsole”); u ambaj, (“one body”) or
odo be ma be (“2 feet, 2 hands”), “20” ; etc., which are fully syntactical.
For the sake of simplicity and unity, however, we do not distinguish
between the various types for our classification as part of speech.
V.9.","[69, 70]"
"The Sentani word is either a simple or a complex form. But a form
is not necessarily a word, because some forms occur in bound position
only. A simple word contains one root. A complex word consists of
one or more roots to which a morphological process has been applied.
The morphological processes are:
1.
2.prefixation to verbal roots of the negative prefix a- (unique case) ;
affixation, by which we understand the adding to the verbal structure of all flexional elements which follow the root, irrespective
of their own mutualorder;3.phonetic root change or apophony;4,
5.suppletion, including (unique case) zero feature;
morphological repetition (dialectally also represented
cation), as distinct from syntactical repetition ;6.composition ;byredupli-combination of two or more of these processes.
Complex words can be distinguished in derived and inflected forms,
according to the criteria set forth for this distinction by L. Bloomfield
(Language, London 1950, pp. 223-4), although, as we shall see, these
sometimes fail us.
Derivation is limited to the processes mentioned under nos. 5 and 6.

"The suppletive form naka, “mother”, also takes the 1** p. du., pL for
the 1** p.sg., but, having an initial consonant, the contraction affects
the possessive differently: ma-naka, “my, our mother”; na-naka, “his,
their, mother’. Here we have a borderline case between composed
and prefixed form; but for the sake of uniformity I prefer to treat

Therelationshiptermsawaw,“mother’snote that the vowelbrother”,andaka,“elderbrother, or sister”, follow the same rules, both as to the type of
possessive and the contraction, as ako, “father”, but they are not
suppletive possessive-determined forms themselves, e.g., ne-waw, “his
uncle’.
In the 2"" p. there is, as we have said, not even suppletion for the
words “father” and “mother”, and the normal “vocative’ forms of
all four relationship words mentioned may be used for the 2™ p. without
any indication of person. If it is necessary to stress the possessive,
however,theIII""seriesis usedherealso,eg.,ana,wejana,“thymother” ; aka, wej aka, “thy elder brother” ; etc.
Lastly it should be noted that in several cases nowadays younger
more regular forms appear besides these irregular, but more normal,
ones. This may be due to a growing modernization, reflected in the
language as well as in other spheres of life.
III.4.","[25, 26]"
"The so-called “tenses”, therefore, also have largely aspectual valueeven in primary form. The secondary forms, however, which are formed
with what I have named the aspectual affixes (see ITI.4.4), are
aspectual in this sense that the action is envisaged as to its goal, either
— in the case of transitive verbs — with reference to an “object”,
direct or indirect, or — in the case of both transitive and intransitive
verbs — with reference to direction, either in space or in time, or toself. The secondary forms are, then, determinate as to effect on goal,
whereas a perfective primary tense, as the primary aorist, is determinate
as to duration of action, the imperfective tenses being indeterminate.
This determinating power is characteristic of the aspectual affixes.
Hence they are very frequent with the only really perfective and
determinatetense,theaorist,if thisrefersto a definiteobject,andpractically indispensable with it if at the same time it takes a personal64GRAMMAROFTHESENTANILANGUAGEobject affix. As a rule, though not always, the object affix then refers
to the indirect object, the aspect affix referring to the direct goal as
describedabove,whichstatementreservation that “object”,must,however,be qualified“direct” and“indirect”in this connectionby theneed not always correspond to the English conceptions; e.g., i fowna-nake, “he jabbed fire at him” (in which i, “fire”, is the direct object,

"The Sentani verbal system is extremely complicated. A verbal form
consists of one or two verbal roots to which may be added affixes for
person (including number) both for the subject and the object (direct
or indirect), mood, tense and aspect. The only prefix in use is the
negative a-. These facts, together with the frequent contraction of
affixes, justify the analysis of the verbal structure on the basis of root
plus affixes only, without making distinction between suffixes andinfixes, and without introducing the notions of “stem” and of “immediate constituents” which would in most cases hardly be a simplification.
Structurally three principal types of verbal forms can be distinguished :
(1)primary forms, which are formed without an aspectual affix;(2)secondary forms, which contain an aspectual affix; and(3)composite forms, which contain two verbal roots.",[26]
"Onthe other handa constructionlike do mije, which we have already mentioned as a composite word
in III. 2. 1., has little else to mark it as morphological or syntactical14GRAMMAROFTHESENTANILANGUAGEthan its meaning, and, as subject in the sentence, its predicate. Thus
do-mije can mean “human being”
(“man-woman”) and is then constructed with a verbal predicate in the singular, eg., do-mije hadake,
“human being (who) died, dead person”. This is clearly a composite
word. The construction can also mean “people” and then takes a verb
in the plural, e.g. Ohej do-mije akajde, “the people of Ohej went off”.
This we can still regard as a composite word. But do mije may alsoverysimplymean“man(and)woman”or“men(and)women”,naturally with the verb in the plural or dual as the case may be. The
last mentioned construction is syntactical of the serial coordinative type
without coordinator (see V.6). But it should be remarked that these
distinctions are not always so clearly marked as our analysis would
lead us to suppose. Thus in a sentence like jej bi foma do da mije da
jejbojme da da bodojdobojme, “hey there, coconut rat, if you could
become a human being (litt.: to man (or) to woman), you would understand me”, the two constituents of what should be the one composite
word do-mije are each separately followed by the postposition da.
Similar cases are such constructions, already mentioned in III. 2. 1,as obo-joku, “animal” (litt. “pig-dog”) and kaji-i’fa, “canoe (in gene-ral)”, which can also have their litteral meaning of “pig(s) (and) dog(s)” ;“women’s(and)men’scanoe(s)”.","[21, 22]"
"The indication of person (with number) for the subject takes place
in different manners for primary and for secondary forms. In primary
forms the affixes for the subject person can formally be divided in
two main categories, which can be termed (1) the actual and (2) the
eventual. The two are, however, not always clearly separated, and
there is some interpenetration. The “actual” forms are found in those
tenses of the indicative which indicate that an action is actually taking
place in the present, or has actually taken place in the past, viz. thepresent, the habitualis, the imperfect and the aorist. The“eventual”affixes occur in those forms which indicate that an action will happen
or is expected, supposed, desired or forbidden to happen, viz., the
future, partly the adhortative and the conditional, and the vetative.
The deviations in the adhortative are the 3"" p.s.,du and pl., which
are similar to the “actual” forms, while in the conditional the deviation
in the 1** p.s. may well be so only in outward appearance, because the-d- element of the “eventual” 1°‘ p.s. may be concealed in the / of the
ending -le. The 2"" p.s. has elements of both categories; the 3"" p.s. issimilar to the “actual”.
Themoststrikingcharacteristicfeatureofthe“actual”andthe“eventual” person affixes as distinct from each other is, that, while
the former seem to have little or no formal relation with the absolute
personal pronouns nor with the personal object affixes, the latter for
the greater part do show such a relation. This is, as far as the future
is concerned, clearly the case at least for the 1** p.s. and pl., the 2™ p. du.
and pl., and (with the absolute pronoun, not the object affix) for the28GRAMMAROF THE SENTANILANGUAGE3° p.s., du. and pl. Even for the 2"" p.s. there is a possibility that a w
has been dropped before the modal ending -le; this -w- at least appears,
in forms with an incorporated person object affix, immediately before
it, and is also found in the secondary future.

Roughly three principal dialects can be distinguished : an eastern dialect,
chiefly including the villages of Buaj (wulgo: Puai), Sjafo (vulgo:
Ajapo) and Ohej (vulgo: Asei); a central dialect including the villages
of the central area of the lake from Noadali (vulgo: Netaar) as far west
as the western end of the strait of Fomfolo (vulgo: Simporo), and
a western dialect including the region to the west of this strait. Smaller
differences of dialect exist between the various villages within each
area. This grammar is concerned with the eastern dialect, more
particularly that of 3 jafo.
The Sentani language is one of a group of closely related Papuan
languages, which I have named the Sentani group, and which includes
Sentani proper in the Sentani Lake district, the language of Nafri on
the Jotefa Bay to the east, and the language of Tanah Merah on the
bay of that name to the west. It appears to be more or less distantly
related to the Demta language to the west of Tanah Merah, which
occupies only a small area, but seems to constitute a group by itself.
Both the Sentani group and Demta seem to belong to a much larger
supergroup of distantly related groups of languages, which I havenamed the “North Papuan phylum”, and whose nearest neighbour to
Sentani is the Nimboran language group. The exact nature of the
relations involved in this phylum, and the position of each group, and
notably of Sentani, within it, are, however, still very unclear.22 See my ‘‘Een tweede grote Papoea-taalgroepering in Nederlands Nieuw-Guinea”,
in Nieuw-Guinea Studién, I, 1957, 107ff, and the litterature cited there.

language in particular.","[9, 10]"
"Postpositional constructions consist of a noun, a pronoun or a verbal
form followed by a postposition, or, except with verbal forms, a postpositional phrase as relation marker. The postposition is enclitic; eg.,ifa na, “in the (men’s) canoe”; bu na, “in the water’; jo da, “to the
village”; ime da, “from the house”; do jele, “with the man’; da da,
“to me, for me”; naje jele, “with him’ (stressed); maka da, “for what,
what for’, to what end?” ; maka na, “in what, because of what, why ?” ;
bele na, “in that, because of that, therefore, hence”; dej na, “as mine,
as my own”; dika na, “yonder”; hina le, “whose?’; makale na (or
na), “in I came, i.e., when(or if or as or because)I came”;mokom-bonde na (or na), “when (or if or as or because) he will do” ; dakakawna
na, “because he awaited him”; adale da, “for I will see, i.¢., in order
that I shall see”; dowale da, “in order that we two will take’ nundew-boke da, “from (that) he disappeared, i.¢., after he disappeared” ; hadake
da, “from (that) he died, after he died” ; etc.
If a noun is followed by an adjective, the postposition follows the
latter, e.g., jo ahaw na, “in a far village” ; u kaban da, “for a big body,
i. in great style” ; do ambaj da, “to one (i.e. a certain) man” ; etc.
In postpositional constructions consisting of a noun or pronoun
followed by a postpositional phrase, the latter functions as a pseudopostposition itself, e.g., bu aj na, “in the water”, i.e. “mid lake” (lit. “in
the water’s inside”) ; bu a na, “beneath the water, under water” ; jakala
dan da, “from up south” ; na. buko da, “to his presence, before him” ; etc.",[62]
"With regard both to repetition and to composition there are cases
which may cause doubt as to whether they are derivational or rather
flexional, on the one hand, and whether they are at all morphological
or rather syntactical, on the other. To a large degree this may be due
to the very strong tendency of the language to phrase sandhi, whence
both morphological and syntactical constructions are close units, phonetically, while both stress and meaning are not always decisive. Hence
the basic criteria for morphological composition and repetition, as
distinct from syntactical, to be regarded as forming single words,sometimes fail us. Thus jobo, “tame pig”, is clearly composed,and(‘jo ‘obo would mean“thetherefore a morphological construction, both because of its contractedform, its stress and its specific meaningvillage’s pig”). But its opposite is aka’la ’obo, “wild pig” (litt. “jungle
pig”), and neither stress nor form, and hardly even its meaning, would
mark it as a composite word. Here we have the syntactical construction
of the subordinative type (1) of V.7. Similarly there is no doubt aboutwords like ambu-lo, “dead (man’s) body”, and ki-lo, “infant boy” (from
do, “man,male’), being composite.",[21]
"According to the position the object affixes occupy in the verbal
structure, three main types can be distinguished:
(1) the iterative (secondary habitualis) places all person object affixes
after the tense sign -ja-, and, as the case may be, after the subject
affix or in the ending, entirely in the same manner as the primary
habitualis ;(2) the adhortative and the conditional place all person object affixes,
and the tenses of the indicative, except the iterative, place the 1** and
3™ p.s., du., pl. object affixes, immediately before the aspect affix ;
(3) the indicative, except the iterative, is irregular as to the position
of the object affixes of the 2"" p.s.,du., pl., for which the following
peculiarities should be noted:
The affix is usually, though not always, placed at once before the
aspect affix and between the subject affix and the mood sign in the
ending,accordingto therulesstatedaboveforthe2™p.s., du., pl.object affixes in primary forms. It is thus indicated twice in the verbal
Verh.dl. 47334GRAMMAROFTHESENTANILANGUAGEstructure, but with this additional peculiarity that the 2™ p.s. has always
-w- before the aspect affix even if it has -j- before the mood sign, while
the 2"" p. du. has in the plural forms of the subject the plural form -mbefore the aspect affix even if it has its normal -b- in the ending. The
2"" p.pl. is regular in having only -m- in both positions. Sometimes,
however, the shorter, more regular, form with only the object affix
inserted before the aspect affix is also found side by side with the
longer form. This is even normal for the 2™ p.s. obj. aff. in the future,
the 2"" p.du. and pl. being entirely similar to each other (-m--mbe).
Otherwise the forms of the object affixes are the same as those in
primary forms, but in the 1** p.du. subject of the future and the
adhortative the 3"" p. object affixes are -nan- (or, through assimilation,
-nam-) for the singular, and -mim- (or, through assimilation, -min-)for the dual and plural, while the 2"" p. du., pl. object affix is -mam-.
The vowels are even more unstable than they are in primary forms.
Being non-distinctive, except for the 3"" p. du., pl., their type is more
or less free, but influenced by environment, viz. the vowels of neighbouring syllables and/or the position of the stress. As in primary forms,
the vowels may precede or follow the consonant, or, in some cases
already referred to, stand between the doubled consonants. Examples:how-na-bo-ke, but by preference how-no-bo-ke,
for him”or “he slew him”;ho-no-bo-be,but“he slew (something)
also ho-na-bo-be,“youtwo will slay (something for) him” (future) ; but always hoj-no-bo, “kill
thou (something for) him!” (because of the stress on -no-); ha-nam-bom, “we two must kill (something for) him”; and regularly hojbojana-le, “I use to kill (something) for him every time” (iterative), and
hojboj-an-e, id. 2"" p.s.; but with normal indifferent vowel a: hojbojowna, id. 3° p.s.; etc.","[41, 42]"
"Characteristic of certain types of phrase is that word junction in
them is accompanied by similar phonetic modifications, syntactophonemic features in this case, as we have seen occurring in morphology in the shape of morphophonemics (II. 1). This is not to say
that such phenomena are always entirely absent in other phrase types
or even in the wider context of the sentence, nor that in those phrases
in which they are common they are obligatory. But they are rare in
the former and frequent in the latter, and if in the latter they are not,
strictly speaking, indispensable, they are yet very regularly observed.
Such types of phrase are notably postpositional and subordinative
combinations, and those with the emphatic particle je; e.g., bum melejah jele, “and fat and round” (with postpos. jele, “with”); mandilin
na or mandilim ma, “in cold, for cold” (postpos. na after --m); Hubulew
fa (dial.) = Hubulew da, “to H.” (postpos. da); hakaj sa = hakaj da,
“for hakaj (a plant)” ; foj sala, “very good”, but na hala, “it (is) much” ;
nej seke, “his (own) garden”, but nej heke, “his (is) a garden, he has
a garden”; dej hakaj bolu najkaj sala, “mine (is) very extraordinary
hakaj-seed” ; ahaw we, “yet, still far-off” (with emphatic particle je);
etc. If in other typesof construction, notably coordinative combinations,
we find similar features, we are justified in doubting whether they
are at all syntactical or rather derivational and composite (III. 2. 1), or
at least in regarding them as borderline cases (III. 2.2), eg., balawsabakaj,“betel (and) tobacco”,ie. the ingredients of the betelquid,53SYNTAXand hence “betelquid”. As usual we shall write in our phonemicization

"Words derived by composition (derivational composition as distinct
from flexional composition) consist of usually two constituent words
which together have the characteristics of a single unit. They are
nouns denoting either a generality or collectivity of the combined
sememesof the constituents,or a determinationof the 2""* constituentby the first, or, if the determinant is an adjective, inversely, or a
relation of origin in which the second constituent stands to the first.

“J. village” ; u-foj, “slave”, from u, “body”, and fo7, “good” (as distinct
from u foj, “good, t.e. healthy, body”) ; but in inverse order: hoko’lo-fa,“the younger or youngest child (of a family)” (as distinct from fa
ho’kolo, “the or a young child”); ba’na-fa, “the elder or eldest child
(of a family)” (as distinct from fa’bana, “the older child’’); a’hamam,
“food”, from aha, “thing”, and am-am, i.e. an(a)-an(a), “eating” (with
shift of the stress to the contracted vowel);and with short phrases:a’han(a)jala, “rations”, from aha, “thing”, and anajjale, “he uses to13MORPHOLOGYeat”(habitualis);jokejjo[jokejgo],“enemy”,fromjo,“village,people”, kej, “throwing”, and again jo; etc.
A sort of abstract nouns is sometimes indicated by preposing

expressions with this pronoun (cf. III. 3.1 and V.8); eg. na-hala,
“Justice” (cf. hala, “right, true, rea *). na-bam, “badness, sin” (cf.

"Four main series of forms of the personal pronoun can be distinguished, which we can regard as inflected by means of phonetic rootchange or apophony,since, although historically they mayrepresent16GRAMMAROF THESENTANILANGUAGElittle more than different degrees of emphasis, they have largely specific

"59SYNTAXIf the adverb determines another adverbposition, eg., wala wala hala,(type 7), it has the same“very quickly”;foj moj sala, “veryexceedingly good” ; etc.
As attribute of a verb the adverb (type 8) may either precede or
follow the verb, the former position being favoured, notably (but not
exclusively) when the adverb is stressed, e.g., nahi’bi duwawoke,
“promptly it sank”; wala-wala jadonko, “quickly fetch” ; wahena dajekulum udale, “to-morrow I shall pack up”; banam dilowfoke, “again
he dived”: nawa dowke, “you’ve got it indeed, all right”; but also:
duwke mo fam, “it only just fell, started falling” ; w-om Jakali dowke
nahi’bi neji molo da, “thy daughter has suddenly taken J. for her
husband” ; nabe u nabe wa jewboke ama-foma, “it was restored entirelyin its original condition” ; etc.
If the verb has an object for attribute (type 9), the latter as a ruleprecedes the former, e.g., fi ukake, “he beat the sago”; dejmaj koma,
“let us make a feast”; na kada-nala awsajawboke, “he squandered his
possessions”;i fownanake,“hejabbedfire at him’;nakada-nalawahewmikoke, “he divided their goods to them”; aka mije jawawnohonde, “thou wilt accompany thy elder brother’s wife”; etc. But
for reasons of emphasis the order is sometimes reversed, e.g., wala-walajadonko malo, “quickly bring here clothes”; adajnobo gha!, “lodk at
the thing!” ; etc.
The object may be qualified or stressed by a postposition, in which
case the attribute is itself a two word phrase of the postpositional
type (V. 5). Postpositions are the rule, of course, for an indirect object
or, with intransitive verbs denoting a movement, for the direction. But
just as in the forementioned examples the incorporated object affixes
referred both to the direct object (aka mije jawawnohonde) and to the
indirect object (¢ fownanake and kada-nala wahewmikoke), a postposition may refer to a direct or an indirect object. The use and the
choice of postpositions with the object depends on the nature of the
action expressed in the verb. In so-called intransitive verbs as a-, “go”,
etc., a postposition indicates the direction of the movement, eg., jo da
ake, “he went to the village’; ime da owoke, “he descended from thehouse” ; etc. Similarly in Dajma da wawna, “he-said-to-him to Dajmo”,Dajmo is the indirect object with the postposition da to the verb wa-,
“say to, tell”, which is at the same time inflected for this same indirectobject by the person object affix -na. And the same situation is found
in Hijako da huwawnokoke, “she related (it all) to H.”. But in joku
na foke hoje, “a dog thou wentst kill”, and in ko na anke anke, “he60GRAMMAROF THE SENTANILANGUAGEhad eaten coconuts”, it is the direct object, which is accompanied by
the postposition na, “in”.
Type (10) lastly, contains two subtypes: (a) one in which the combination consists of a single noun as head preceded by a two-word
phrase of type (1) or (4), with a noun, interrogative pronoun, or theemphatic possessive,plus mej,“due”,as attribute;and(b) one inwhich the combination consists of a single noun as attribute, followed
by a two-word phrase of type (4), with the normal possessive of the
3 p. na
na plus another noun, as head. The first subtype denotes
a relation, possessive or other, in which the head is the due of, is the
thing destined or meant for, the attribute, eg., Nakahabo mej ko,“the Lobster’s coconut (his due, his part)”; hina mej habakaj, “whose
tobacco (due to whom) ?”; we7 mej ime, “thy house (meant for thee)” ;
nej mej kada-nala, “goods due to them’; etc. The second subtype
denotes a specialized relation of origin or possession, as distinct fromthe generalized relation of type (1); eg., joku na falam, “the head of
the dog”, as distinct from joku falam, “dog’s head”; Dajma na joku,
“D.’s dog”; am oloku na fe, “oloku-banana leaf”, as distinct from amfe, “banana leaf” (generally); ondofolo na fa, “the chief’s child”, as
distinct from ondofolo fa, “a chief’s child” ; Dasim n-omi, “D’s daughter” ; ondofolo na fala, “the bow-and-arrow of the chief” ; etc.

"Sentaniword,whosestructurewasdealtwithinthechapters on phonology and morphology, is a minimum free form, the
sentence is the maximum free form of an utterance which is a grammatical unit. It stands in absolute position and is not included in a
longer grammatical form. The sentence contains one or more phrases,
free forms in included position which in their turn consist of one or
more words. An example of a sentence which is at the same timea phrase and a word, is, e.g., hadake, “he (has) died” (3™ p.s. primaryaorist of hada-). An example of a two-word phrase which is not a
sentence, is, eg., ime kabam, “the (or a) big house”. But this same
form can, with or without a slight pause between the two words, also
mean “the house is big”, and then we have an example of a two-word
phrase which is at once a sentence. A sentence which contains more52GRAMMAROFTHESENTANILANGUAGEthan one phrase is, e.g., ka’jt Rabam nahi'bi duwawoke, “the big canoe

"The tenses, besides indicating a time element, also have other properties which belong in the aspectual sphere. We have named them “tenses”
because of that time element, and there is no more objection to this
than there is to the use of that term in other languages in which time
is not the only characteristic feature of the categories concerned. This
has, moreover, the advantage that we can use the term “aspectual” for
a category of affixes with which we shall now deal, and which, though
not aspectual in the sense accepted for certain better known modern
languages, do determine the aspect of a verb as to its goal. We shall
go into the temporal and aspectual features of both tenses and aspectual
forms in greater detail in the chapter on Syntax (see V.9). Heresuffice it to add that I had named
NotesonSentaniGrammar,the latter forms “modal”mentionedin theIntroduction,in my
becausethey “modify” the verb in the indicated sense. But this term is equivocal
in view of the real “moods” which Sentani possesses. Also the aspectual
affixes are not restricted to any one mood, but occur in all moods,
including the negative and the vetative, and are even found in the24GRAMMAROFTHESENTANILANGUAGEgerund. We shall name the forms with aspectual affixes secondary
forms as against the primary forms without them.
Morphophonemically the aspectual affixes are distinct from the other
verbal affixes, for both mood,tenseandperson,in that their vowelsare practically always constant, although this may be largely due to
the fact that in the verbal structure they happen to be always followed
by a consonant.19 Only -bo- in quick speech sometimes contracts with
the habitualis -7a- to -bajo-, bijo- for the more normal -bojo-. If the
aspect affix begins with a vowel and the preceding flexional element
of the verb ends in a vowel,the twovowelslinked by the consonant -j-, e.g., awa-j-amare not contracted,(for *aw-a-a-m),but“let ustwo row off”. In the indicative the aspect affix immediately precedes
the sign for tense, which means for the secondary future preceding its
-n- in all persons except the 2° p.du. where, the tense sign beingzero, it precedesthe moodending,eg.ho-do-bo-nde,“TI shall kill(something), but ho-bo-be (2™ p.du.). In the habitualis, which, with
the aspect affixes, forms a kind of iterative (cf. V.9), the preceding
root has the usual -j- extension, e.g., dawa-j-bo-j-ale, “I am used to
open (it) every time’. In the adhortative the aspect affix is found at
the extreme end of the verbal structure, except in the 1** p.s., du., pl.in which an additional -m follows it, e.g., ho-j-bo, “kill thou (some10 Historically speaking, the aspectual affixes, with the exception of -nu, may
well have been short verbal roots, and the secondary forms may really have
been composite forms originally. This is almost certain for some of the directive
affixes which, with the exception of -di- (verbs never end in a high vowel,
apart from the variants mentioned in III. 4.1), still occur as verbal roots as
well. And some of the objective affixes, such as -ko- and -bo-, may have had
something to do with verbs as ko-, “‘do, act”, and bo-, “aim, beat”, although
these meanings are not now recognizable. However, the secondary forms

A similar distinction in determination as exists between the aorist
and the imperfective tenses, is found between the secondary future
and the primary future. Hence the distinction between primary and
secondary future is very much like that in modern Greek between
a futurum praesentis (or continuum) and a futurum aoristt (or absolutum). The same is, mutatis mutandis, the case for the distinction
between primary and secondary adhortative and primary and secondary
conditional. Examples: ukawna hondombi fonde folonkonde, “he toldhim to go across (and) cut hondombi”(lit. “he told him he will goacross (and) will...”; in which fonde is in the primary future, but
folonkonde has the asp. aff. -ko- referring to hondombi 2° and determining the action as to this object and perfectivating it as to time) ;
foj am fe kamawbonde dawawmande, “go across to (lit. thou wilt)
tear off a banana leaf (and) to (lit. thou wilt) bring it home” (with

“voice, words”; while wajajde must contain the obj. aff. -jaj- of the2"" p.s., but must not take an asp. aff.) ; etc.

examples of the use of the aspect affixes in the uninflected and partly
inflected forms: the gerund, the negative and the vetative.","[74, 75]"

ie, without special indication of the possessive in this person unless
it is stressed, as the possessive-determined form for the 2"" person by
others addressing the parents’ child or children. The suppletive allo-morph ako, “father”, takes, in principle, the possessives of the ITI”

allomorph for the 1°* p.sg., and the construction, unless when the

be best described as a composite form as distinct from the simple
preposing of the possessives of series II, III and IV, which is a syntactical process (cf. V.7). It cannot be regarded as a prefixed form,
since me- and ng- are not bound forms, but also occur independently.

"By repetition of root forms is formed a verbal noun or gerund.
Structurally there are two types which are distinguished by (1) a dissyllabic or polysyllabic root, ending in -a preceded by one of the
consonants admitted as finals, and (2) all other roots. The former
tending, as we have seen (II. 4. 1 and III. 4. 1), to treat this consonant
as root-final, it repeats the root in this form, with the consonant as
final, e.g., hon-som (for *hom-hom < *hon-hon), “burning”, from
hona-,“burn,grill, roast”;am-am(for *an-an),“eating”,fromana-,“eat”? (cf. the composite word a’hamam, “food”, lit. “things (for)
eating’’); dow-dow, “taking, receiving”, from dowa-, “take”; etc. The
other type adds -7- to the root as in certain other flexional forms (seet.a. III. 4. 2-4), eg. a-j-a-j, “going”; from a-, “go”; o-j-o-7, “descending’, from o-, “descend”; be-7-be-j, “seeking’’, from be-, “seek”; he-jsé-j, “hanging”, from he-, “hang’”’; etc.
The gerund can also be formed from secondary forms, in which case40GRAMMAROF THE SENTANILANGUAGEthe repetition is omitted, and the aspect affix takes the place of the
second constituent of the repetition, eg., a-j-di, “going up” (withdirective asp. aff. -di-); 0-j-bo, “collapsing, falling down’ (from o-,
“descend”, with asp. aff. -bo-); de-j-ko, “penetrating, driving into” (as
of tree-roots); huw-bo,“feeling” (from huwa- and asp. aff. -bo-); etc.","[47, 48]"
"The Sentani language has 7 vocalic and 10 consonantal phonemes.
Apart from minor non-distinctive deviations, vowel phonemes have as
a rule very fixed phonetic values. But consonantal phonemes are very
rich in non-distinctive variants of often strongly deviating phonetic
types. These allophones are, generally speaking, “free”, although to a
certain extent combinatory influences play their part. Only in some
cases allophones are positionally “bound”.
However,inadditiontothe“normal”non-distinctivevariationreferred to above, in which the allophonic limits of the phonemes concerned are not exceeded, there occurs for certain phonemes under
certain combinatory conditions an equally non-distinctive variation
which does exceed the phonemes’ limits of non-distinctiveness. Here
there is, therefore, neutralization of the opposition between the phonemes involved in this type of variation. As in the case of the normal
allophonic variants, these heterophonemic variants are partly “free”,
_ partly positionally “bound”.
Thus the /h/ phoneme hasanafter nasal, /j/ and /i/, eg.kejsi,[s]allophonewhich“throw away!”is obligatory(with aspectualaffix -hi-), but kej-na-hi (with incorporated pronominal object affix).
But this allophone [s] also occurs after /w/, e.g. kewsike, “he threw
away (aorist)”, in which position, though, it is not obligatory. For
here a heterophonemic non-distinctive variant of this /h ~~ s/ phoneme
is also possible, and, as far as my observations go, even more frequent.
This variant is [f], itself a labiodental variant of the fricative phoneme
// which as such has both labiodental and bilabial allophones. Hence
there is, after /w/, freedom of choice between allophonic [s] and
heterophonemic [f], but this choice is obligatory, e.g. kewfike or kewsike,and not *kewhtke.
In certain speech-forms, notably in the central dialect, this [s] and
[f] may even occur as non-distinctive variants of the /d/ phoneme,
after /j/ and /w/ respectively. This may be due to the facts described
in note (5) hereafter. We will normally disregard these dialectal
peculiarities, except in those texts in which they happen to occur. We4GRAMMAROFTHESENTANILANGUAGEwill, of course, equally disregard in our spelling normal non-distinctivecombinatory changes, such as [fi] for /n/ and[d’} or [t’] for /d/after /j/ and /i/; etc. But we cannot, in our phonemic notation, neglect
the heterophonemic variation, which occurs in our eastern dialect. Nor
even can we, in my opinion, ignore in our notation the allophone [s]
of the /h/ phoneme, because of its obligatory nature and its deviating
phonetic type. Similar considerations apply to the partial neutralization
of /d/ and /1/, and the mutual assimilations of the nasals /m/ and
/n/, or their interchange in assimilation to other consonants; and
certain other phenomena.
In the following pages these phonetic phenomena, both of an allophonic and a heterophonemic nature, will be treated when dealing with
the phonemes concerned. Any further morphophonemic implications
of a more specific nature will be indicated when the morphological
constructions concerned are dealt with. They are not so complicated
as to justify a separate section on morphophonemics. Since similar
phonetic phenomena occur in certain syntactic constructions, this
syntactophonemic aspect will be discussed in its proper place also
(see V. 3. 1).

"(3)the first verb is in the imperfect and the second in the aorist, thissecond verb being either primary or secondary;
(4) the first verb is in the aorist and the second in the present;
(5) the first verb is in the aorist and the second in the imperfect;
(6) the first verb is in the aorist and the second in the aorist of
secondary form with directive aspect affix ;(7) both verbs are in the future, the second being either a primary
or a secondary form;
(8) the first verb is in the adhortative and the second either in simpleroot-form (with only the 1** p.s., du., pl. extended with the usual -m),
or in secondary form.
Structurally two principal categories can be distinguished in these
combinations :
(I) the first verb is in an imperfective or undeterminate form,
followed by the second verb in a perfective or determinate form, exceptthe secondary habitualis or iterative of type (2), which, though determinate, follows category (IT);
(II) all other combinations, with the exception of combination
type (7) (both constituents in the future), which, although the primaryfuture is more or less indifferent to aspect, always follows category (1),36GRAMMAROF THESENTANILANGUAGEand combination type (8) (adhortative) which also follows category (I),
but with some peculiarities of its own, particularly if the second constituent is a secondary form.
In other words: in category (I) belong only the types (3), (7) and (8),
in category (II) all the other types.
The characteristic difference in structure between the two categories
is the following:
In category (II) the 2™ constituent of the compound is fully inflected
according to mood, tense and person for the subject concerned as
primary or secondary form, as the case may be, while the only flexional
affixes occurring in the 1°‘ constituent are those for tense and person
for the subject, these latter being the “actual” forms of III. 4.5, with
the following exceptions: In type (4), (5) and (6) the 2""* p.s. has been
reduced to -a-, and the 3"" p.s. may have either -a- (a morphophonemic
variant of zero) or -w- (-aw-); in type (1) the 3"" p.s. has only -w-;
and in type (2) the only flexional affix appearing in the first verb is
throughout the -j- which is characteristic of the habitualis.
In category (I) the 2"" constituent of the compound has exactly the
same flexional affixes as those following the aspect affix in non-composite secondary forms of the corresponding tenses and moods (see
III. 4. 6). This means that (a) if the second constituent of the compound
is in the aorist (type 3), the singular persons are inflected fully in the
regular manner (-k-a-le, -k-e, -k-e), but the dual and plural persons
all have the one characteristic form in -ke similar to that of the 3"" p.s.;that (b) if the 2"" constituent is in the future (type 7), only the 2” p. du.
and pl. have the regular endings (-be, -mbe) but all the other persons
have the constant form in -n-de similar to the 3"" p.s. (m for the future
and -de for the indicative); and that (c) if the compound is in the
adhortative (type 8), an additional -m follows, in the 1*° p.s., du., pL,
the second (root-form) constituent. If, however, the 2™ constituent is
a secondary form, the -m follows the aspect affix with optional pleonastic addition after the 2“ constituent, whereas then a similar repetitionof the person affix of the first constituent is found in the 2™ and 3” p.s.
The flexional elements in the first constituent of such compounds
of category (I) also are in accordance with those which, in the corresponding tenses and moods of non-composite secondary forms, follow
the root and precede the aspect affix; with the following exceptions:
In type (3) the 1*° p.d., pl. have the regular -an- and -an- forms
respectively, in conformity with the normal “actual” flexion, as against
the forms -anda- and -anda- which we have found in the non-composite37MORPHOLOGYsecondary aorist (see III. 4.6). In the adhortative (type 8) the 3™ p.s.
has -an- like the future instead of the normal -w-.
There is thus a strong resemblance between the last-mentioned compounds and the corresponding non-composite secondary forms. The
differences are only few, as we have seen. Also a similar morphophonemic rule, as valid for the juncture between an aspect affix beginning with a vowel and a preceding flexional element ending in a vowel
in secondary forms (cf. III. 4.4), applies to the composite forms: if
the second constituent of the compound begins with a vowel and the
preceding flexional element of the first constituent ends in a vowel,
the two vowels are not contracted or assimilated but linked by -j-, eg.,ma-j-ana-n-ko-n-de, “we two shall come-eat” (1°* p. du. fut. of ma-,
“come”, plus ana- with asp. aff. -ko-, “eat”; type 7). But we have alsoseen (cf. note 10 supra), that there are several good structural objections to regarding these compounds and the non-composite secondary
forms as similar formations, at least synchronically; historically, of
course, they may well be of similar origin.","[43, 44, 45]"
"Type (5) consists of a noun followed by a finite verb form which,
however, has not finite, but participial or relative, function, eg., do
is, moreover, restricted to standing expressions like the one mentioned,
is really only functionally subordinated (as from our point of view),
but structurally it is not essentially different from the serially coordinative type of construction of phrases mentioned in V. 6.1, 374 para.
The adverb which determines an adjective (type 6) follows it, eg.,foj sala, “very good” (s for h after j); hele najkaj sala, “a very loud
shouting” ; mahs-mahe bamo, “only some, only a few”; do ambaj fam,
“even one man”; do halan nam, “so many men” for *halam +
fam ~ ham); etc.",[66]
"Person for the subject in secondary forms is indicated in different
waysaccordingto tense or, as the case maybe, mood;and, for eachtense or mood, according to person and/or number.
In the secondary habitualis or iterative the position of the person
subject affix is regular throughout, following the tense affix and
preceding the mood sign. In the aorist and in the conditional the
indication of person for the subject differs according to number, the
affix following the tense sign in the regular manner of III. 4,3 in
the singular, but following the root and preceding the aspect affix
in the dual and plural. In addition, in the singular persons of the aorist
a -w- immediately follows the root and precedes the aspect affix, thedual and plural having, like the 3"" p.s., throughout the ending -kefollowing the aspect affix. However, the 3"" p. du. and pl. have a
younger, more regular, form besides, in which the regular endings
-aj-de and -aj-de are added pleonastically after the tense sign -ka-,thus: -k-aj-de, -k-aj-de. This -w- may be a syllable-final allomorphand perhaps even a phonetic derivative of the / of the indicative sign -le.
The ending -ke is the contraction of tense and mood signs (< *-k (a)-le),
already mentioned in III. 4.2. The singular persons of the conditional
have -j- immediately following the root in the 1** and 2™ p.s., and -win the 3™ p.s., the dual and plural having, like the 3° p.s., throughout
the final -be, as described in III. 4.2. In the 1° p.du. and pl. both
aorist and conditional have -anda- and -anda- respectively instead ofthe “actual” -an- and -an-. With the forementioned restrictions and
personalexceptions,thecorrespondto theaffixes“actual”andof aorist“eventual”andconditionalformsotherwiseof the precedingsection respectively. Examples: (habitualis) mokoj-bo-j-a-le, “T am
used to make or do (something) every time” ; mokoj-bo-jo-j-e, id. 2™ ps. 5mokoj-bo-j-aj-de,id.",[37]
"The sign of the adhortative is zero; e.g., mada, “let me come”; maj,
“come thou!”; ma, “let us two come’; etc. For the adhortative in
secondary forms, see III. 4.4; and in composite forms ITI. 4. 9.
The conditional 9 has only endings of its own in the singular, both
primary and secondary, and in the secondary dual and plural, the
primary forms of the dual and plural being supplied by the present
of the indicative. The sign is b in all forms, except the 1°* and 2™ p.s.
8 A much more regular occurrence of the indicative mood sign is found in the
Nafri language, which is very instructive for the situation in Sentani too.
9 This mood, or at least its 2! p.s. which is quite identical in the two languages,
is used as a common imperative in Tanah Merah.",[29]
"There are four principal types of predicative constructions: (1) the
verbal, (2) the nominal (including pronominal), (3) the emphatic and
negative, and (4) the postpositional.
The first type consists of an inflected verb form as predicate which
may itself express the subject or may be preceded by a separate word
as subject. The predicate may or may not be accompanied by one ormore attributes of V.7, types (8) and(9) hereafter, the latter (theobject) as a rule intervening between subject and the predicate; e.g.,
ondofolo hadake, “the ondofolo (a clan chief) died”; Ajokoj anawole,
“A ate, was eating”; ka’ji nahi’bi duwawoke, “the (women’s) canoe
promptly sank”; bu na dilowfoke, “he dived off (over) into the water” ;
ko awajjajde, “they are all the time peeling the coconut’; J akaltna-hu'we ajboke nej jo da, “they transported J. in the afternoon to his
(own) village”; duka aj-saba maj-saba ahabaj-je, “don’t throw stones
hither and thither” (lit. “...go-throwing come-throwing”); etc. The
subject may be stressed by the emphatic particle je, e.g., do je male,“a man comes, it is a man who comes”; an no je dika na honole, “(it is)a banana tree (that) is lying yonder”’ ; etc.
The second type consists of a subject followed by a noun, adjective
(including the numerals) or pronoun as predicate; here too the predicate
may be accompanied by an attribute (including paratactical appositions),eg., da do Dajma,“my name(is) D.”; ime kabam,“the house (is)big”; ondofolo fa be, “the ondofolo’s children (are) two”, 1.e., “the o.has two children” ; daka nej, “this (is) his”; bele hina?, “that (is) who?,
who is that?’;daka maka?,child (is) where (or which)?;“this (is) what?”;wafa amba?,“yourbele naje, “that (is) he, there he is”.",[61]
"The coordinative combination of words to phrases can be realized
either by mere juxtaposition, i.e., without coordinator ; or — in nominal
constructions only — by the usually, but not necessarily, repeated postposition de ~ le or — more emphatic — jele, “with”; or again by be,
“two, both’’, placed after the second constituent, if there are two. E.g.,foke hoje, “thou wentst (and) thou killst, i.¢., thou wentst to kill” ;
fokajde molajkoke, “they (pl.) went (and) buried”; ake kolukawna,
“she went (and) held him”; fi ukake kajewkoke nawole, “he choppedthe sago, cleft (it), (and) picked (it out)”;19aj-saba maj-saba,throwingthither(and)come-throwing,7.e., throwing(and)“go-throwinghither”; kalu omi, “son(s) (and) daughter(s)”; aka beka, “kith (and)
kin”; do mije, “man (or men) and woman (or women)” (but see for
other possibilities of this combination, III. 2.2); Sbaw de Nakahabole, “the Tortoise and the Lobster”; Jakali le Ajokoj de, “J. and A.”;
do jele mije jele, “man and woman, husband and wife’; (obo) bum
mele jahi jele,“(pigs)fat andround”;SAbalaJakalHubulewbe,“both Jakali of Abala (and) Hubulew”’; etc.
As a specific syntactic type of word coordination must be regarded
word repetition, syntactical repetition, that is, as distinct from morphological, both derivational and flexional, repetition (cf. III. 1, III. 2,
and III. 2.2). The two constituents are quite identical both in form
(in the case of verbs in fully inflected form) and in meaning, nor is the
meaning of the combination essentially changed, apart from being
repetitive or frequentative; e.g., ja ja, “day (and) day, day (after) day,daily”; doko doko, “again (and) again”; fole fole, “he goes on (and)
on”; anke anke (for anake anake), “he ate (and) ate, had eaten (and)
eaten; awkajde awkajde, “the two (had) paddled (and) paddled”;
19 Since a one word inflected verb form may also constitute a phrase, some of
these verbal examples can also in a way be regarded as examples of phrase
coordination.",[63]
"If the composite form takes a personal object affix, it may have
various positions in the structure according to whether the form is one
of category (I) or category (II), and, in the former case, whether the
second constituent of the compound is a primary or a secondary form.
(a) If the compound is one of category (I), the object affix is treated
in the same manner as it is in non-composite secondary forms, as if
the first constituent were the verbal root and the second constituent the
aspect affix (cf. IIT. 4. 8).
(b) If, however, the second constituent of such a category (I) compound is a secondary form, the object affix may be placed either as
described in (a) supra — and this by preference —, or both as in (a)
and again in the second constituent at the same time, which latter is
then fully inflected as a non-composite secondary form with an. object
affix. The object affix thus may occur twice in the compound.
(c) If the composite form is one of category (II), the object affix is
placed in the second constituent according to the rules of the corresponding non-composite forms, although sometimes here too the double
indication is found — incorrectly, as one of my informants said — if
the second constituent is a secondary form.
Examples: (type a) a-w-na-wa-k-a-le, “I went-told him” (with 3""

"The Sentani vowel system is as follows:

€LowBacka)re)aAllophonic variants of these vowel phonemes, if compared with
the consonants, are generally slight. They are mostly limited to minor
differences in length and/or tenseness (narrowness) of articulation,
those in stressed open syllables being pronounced longer and more
tensely than those in closed or unstressed open syllables. In the case
of /o/, which is a mid back vowel, this goes parallel with a variation
between higher and lower positions, and for /a/, a mid indifferent
vowel, between [6] and [a] types respectively.3
3 There are indications that, from a historico-structural point of view, the /a/
phoneme has originally filled, in a different phonetic form, the empty place
now existing in the mid-back vowel sequence if compared with the mid-frontPHONOLOGY5/a/, though shown as a low indifferent vowel, is usually pronounced
frontally rather than backwardly.
In open accentuated syllables of words of more than one syllable
/i/ is often lengthened to such an extent that it even tends to diphthongize to [ij], which in an extreme type of articulation sometimes
even becomes [i&] in conformity with the fact that /j/ after /j/ or /i/
is frequently pronounced in its non-distinctive variant [g], e.g. wne,[ime, ijme, igme].“house”Nasalized vowels sometimes occur as non-distinctive variants of
vowel followed by syllable final nasal, notably before /k/, more rarely
before [s]. Sometimes the nasalization is dropped or almost dropped
and the vowel at the same time slightly lengthened. This lengthening
is no more phonemic than the one mentioned before, since the relevant
feature in question is not long vowel as opposed to short vowel, but
vowel -++ nasal (with variants) as opposed to simple non-nasalized vowel.[awbanks, awbako,E.g., awbaNkaawba:ka],“cassowary”;HaNsa

"MORPHOLOGY19An apparent third possibility of composition of similar roots in
inflected forms other than that mentioned in (b), is really that of a
verbal root indicating movement, which takes what seems to be originally a bound variant of the same root as an aspectual affix and
thereby stresses the direction of that same movement (see IIT. 4. 4. 1).
This belongs, therefore, in the category of secondary forms of (2) supra.
Repetition of fully and independently inflected verb forms is syntactical and does not belong in this chapter (see III. 2.2 and V. 6).
In the categories of non-composite, i.e., primary and secondary,
forms alone, a simple calculation will show that the number of theoretically possible verbal forms, including all moods, tenses and aspects,
and including both forms with and without object affixes, amounts to
more than 4,000, of which the indicative alone accounts for some 2,500.","[26, 27]"
"MORPHOLOGY17head”; but often also speech usage assigns the one or the other form
to definite words, eg., wa ma, “thy hand”; na dama, “his tail”; na
ime, “his house”;na jo, “his village”; na kalu,“his (brother’s)son” ;da u, “my body”; etc., but na fa, “his child” (though na hokolo-fa, “his
younger child”); na a’hanajala, “his rations”; na waku, “his drum” ;
na jam, “its (the house’s) roof”; etc. Neither euphony nor classification
of nouns plays a demonstrable part in this, although, naturally, the
latter may have existed in an earlier phase of the language and may
have had its influence at the time.
III. 3.2.","[24, 25]"
"Naturally these possibilities do not all occur for every single verb, and
some have similar forms for dual and plural object affixes. But the
calculation shows clearly enough that the actually possible forms do
number some thousands.

"Similarly the gerund of roots indicating a movementmay as firstconstituent enter into composition with other verbal roots as second
constituent, e.g., a-j-saba, “going-throw” ; ma-j-saba, coming-throw” ;i.e., “throwing thither” and “throwing hither” respectively, from haba-,
“throw, cast, strike’.
This gerund may also combine with another flexional form of the
same verb to intensify its meaning. This construction, though more or
less a borderline case, is to be regarded as composite and flexional for
the reasons set forth in III. 2.2, last para. Also it shows a peculiarity
which is also found in other composite flexional verb forms, viz. the
juncture consonant -7- between a final vowel of the 1** and an initial
vowel of the 2” constituent; e.g., de-j-ko - de-w-no-ko-ke, “penetrating,
it penetrated into it” (gerund of de- with asp. aff. -ko- plus 3"" p.s.
secondary aorist with -ko-, and with obj. aff. 3°° p.s. -no-); but o-j-bo-j- o-w-bo-ke, “collapsing it collapsed” (gerund of o-, “descend, fall”,
with asp. aff. -bo- plus 3™° p.s. secondary aorist with -bo-; the two
constituents linked by -j- between the final vowel of the first and the
initial vowel of the second) ; etc.",[48]
"Phrases of one word mayconsist of an inflected form, e.g., hadake,“he died”, or a root word, eg., ako!, “father, old man!”’; maka?,
“what?’; nal, “yes!; nawa, “indeed! good!’”.
Phrases of more than one word are formed by predicative, postpositional, coordinative, or subordinative (including appositional) combination of lesser free forms.
V.3.1.",[60]
"22GRAMMAROF THESENTANILANGUAGEIn the 2"" p.s. it is m; in the 1** p.s. it seems to coincide with the
indication of the person; e.g., a-le, “should I go, I would go”; a-j-me,
“shouldst thou go”; a-w-be, “should he go”; and with asp. aff.
-(secondary forms): jej-bo-le, jejbo-j-me, and jewbo-be; and in the
secondary plural: jendabo-be (1** p. du.) ; egbo-be (< *je-aj-) (3° p. pl.) ;
etc., these secondary forms of the plural being formed after a similar
structural model as the secondary aorist, the ending -be corresponding
to -ke in the latter (see III. 4. 6).
The sign of the negative is the prefix g- in combination with the
affix (or root extension) -7. If the initial of the root is itself a, the
prefix is either added by means of the junction consonant -j-, or it
contracts with the a of the root which is then somewhat lengthened
and takes the stress. The relevant element is this stress, not length.
In secondary forms, the aspectual affix which follows the root extension
-j-, is again followed by this element in addition. The negative thus
formed, is not otherwise inflected; e.g., a-’ma-j, “not come”; a-haba-j,“not hit”; but a-j-a-7, “not go”; a-j-ala-j, but also ’ala-7, “not speak”,
as opposed to a’/aj, “speak thou!” (adhort. 2 p.s.); da a-hojboj, “T do,
did, shall not kill (something)” ; na a-j-anajkoj, “he does, did, will not
eat (it); a-duwa-j-o-j,“it does, did, will not fall down’;etc.","[29, 30]"

"The first grammatical description of the Sentani language was
published by this writer in Oceania, vols. XXI (1950-51), pp. 214-228
and 302-309; and XXII (1951-’52), pp. 53-71 and 315-316, under thetitle of “Notes on Sentani Grammar”. It was the result of fieldwork
during my stay in West New Guinea in the years 1946-1950. As was
stated at the time in the introduction, this fieldwork could only be done
to the extent that official civil service duties permitted. But during
a furtheroftermservice,whichfinallyendedin1956,I hadtheopportunity of collecting more data concerning the language. This has
led to the present much more complete new grammar.
The following texts have been published by the author before:A-specimen text in the “Notes on Sentani Grammar” forementioned,(1)being a translation of part of the Story of the Prodigal Son, which is
now published in full in the present work ;

provided with an extensive grammatical annotation as well as a
translation in Dutch. This text is reprinted in this book in a slightly
revised form;“Drie verhalen in Sentani-taal” (in Bijdragen tot de Taal-, Land-(3)en Volkenkunde, 108, 1952). These texts too have been provided with
extensive notes as well as a translation, but reference was largely madeto the “Notes on Sentani Grammar”. A different version of the first

"There are five moods: the indicative, with the uninflectable negative,
the imperative-adhortative (here named adhortative only), with the
vetative (limited to the 2"" p.s., du. and pl. as far as the subject is
concerned), and the conditional or optative (here named conditional).
The sign of the indicative is -le ~~ -de~ -be, the morphophonemic
distribution of these three allomorphs over the various forms following
the obligatory “heterophonemic” variation in certain positions of /1/
and /d/ as far as the former two are concerned, while -be occurs after
labials (b, m and w, of which b + -be > -be). The modal sign follows,
generally speaking, the person subject affix and is the final element
in the verbal structure. However, in the 2 p.s. of the present, the
imperfect and the primary and secondary forms of the aorist and theMORPHOLOGY21habitualis, as well as in the 2™ p.du. of the primary and secondary
forms of the future, the indicative mood sign coincides with the person
subject affix, (-j)-e and -be respectively. In the 2 p.s. of the primary
and secondary aorist, moreover, the combined mood -++ person ending
contracts with the tense affix to -ke. In the 3"" p.s. of the primary
aorist and in all persons, except the 1° and 2™ p.s., of the secondary
aorist, the modal sign coalesces with the tense affix to -ke, but perhaps
reappears as -w- in the singular persons of the secondary aorist between
root and aspect affix (see IIT. 4. 6). For the morphophonemic rules of the
indicative sign in contact with object affixes, see otherwise II. 4. 7.8Examples for primary forms : ma-le, “I come” ; ma-j-e, “thou comest”’ ;maka-le, “I came” (aorist); mak-e, “thou camest”; mak-e, “he came” ;
but uka-w-na, “he told him”; makan-de, “we two came”; mawo-j-e,“thou camest” (imperf.); mawoj-de, “they two came” (impertf.);
mawaw-be, “you (pl.) came’; ma-be, “you two will come” (fut.);
mam-be, “you (pl.) will come”; mokojja-le, “I use to work all thetime” (habit.); mokojja-j-e, “thou usest to work all the time”; etc.
And for secondary forms: howboka-le, “I killed (something)” (aor.) ;howbok-e, “thou killedest (something)” ; howbok-e (3™ p.s. id.) ; hondabok-e, howbok-e, hojbok-e, etc. (1**, 2"", 3"" p. du. etc. id.) ; mokojboja-le, “I do, make (something) every time” (second. habit. or iterat.) ;
mokojbojow-be (2 p. du. id.) ; hodabon-de, “T shall kill (something)” ;howbon-de (2™ p.s. id.); hobo-be (2™ p. du. id.); etc.
In composed verbal forms the second constituent of the compound
carries the indicative sign, and this follows either the same rules as
for the present, the habitualis or the imperfect on the one hand, or
those for the secondary aorist or the secondary future on the other,
according to whether the compound is one of the II"" or one of the
I** category described in III. 4.9. For examples see ibid.","[28, 29]"
"As we have said, phrase coordination is usual, even where we would
have to translate with a subordinate phrase or clause (see V. 6. 1).
For clause subordination, however, there are other possibilities. In
subordinate clauses the postposition na ~ na may be used in the sense
of “when, if, as, for, since, because”. This meaning of the postposition
has already been noted in dealing with the postpositional phrase; herefollow some examples of full sentences: daje makale na (or na) naje
