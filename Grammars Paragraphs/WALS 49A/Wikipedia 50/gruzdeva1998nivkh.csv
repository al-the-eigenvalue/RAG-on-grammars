"For its part, a couple of sentences(76a) and (76b) demonstratesanother way of
coding subject and object case-roles,that is an initial consonant alternation of
the verb io-'bring', One can see that eybl'child' is a subject in (76a), but a
direct object in (76b), cf.:
(76) a.",[22]
"In the sentenceswithout overt be-copula the predicative noun or pronoun
usually occupies the final position and takes the predicative particle <AD, EsD>

rain-rrNA direct object forms a particularly close unit with the verb syntactically as well
as phonologically. As one must remember (see section 2.5), a direct object
triggers an alternation in the following verb. In view of the virtual absenceof
verb agreementand case-markingfor subjects,direct and indirect objects,and
nominal attributes,word order and initial consonant alternation are often the
only devicesfor differentiating syntactic constructions.
For instance,word order signalsthat k'elp'fox' is a subject in (75a), but
a direct object in (75b), while vazqx'heron' is a subject in (75b), but a direct
object in (75a), cf.:(7s) a.",[21]
"All plural personalpronouns can take the plural suffix, cf. n'yp-l, n'yq-gu'we',

spear',vi-nanak3.4. Verbs
There are two basic patterns of verbal form building: (a) R + suffix(es), (b)
prefix + R + suffix(es), *ith the obvious tendency of suffixation. Only object,Lw/M llr29NIVKHreflexive, and reciprocal markers cliticize on the verb as prefixes. Most commonly, the suffixes follow the root in the order R - transitive - negatitte- tense
/ aspectual- causative- modal - evidential - mood - number. More than one
aspectualor modal marker may appear on the verb. Consider the verbal form
consisting of 8 morphemes: j-uski-ivu-gu-iny-t'yyffi-d1un {oBr-pay-MpRF-cAUs'[I
MoD-EvID-FrN-ru]seethat they] are going to demand [that he] pays [for sth.]'.
Intransitivity / transitivity ofthe verb is reflectedin its phonetic structure.
As seenabove in section 2.3, intransitivesbegin with plosives,while transitives
- with fricatives. However, there exists a small class of verbs which carry the
'fall' -+
transitivizing suffix <ep, EsD>-u-, cf. polvol-u'throw down [sth.]',
'put
t'oz-'go out (about a fire)' -+ zoz-u
out [sth.]'. In the group of the most
ancient verbs the pronominal markers of a direct object j-, i-, e- are cliticized
'kill
as a prefix on the verb, cf. j-ar-'feed [sb.l', l-x[sb.]', e-v-'hold [sb. /
sth.]'. Someverbs denoting a placeof action contain the component <AD> hur-,
<EsD> hus!-'here, there', which is omitted when a direct object appearsin the
'lean
sentence,cf. hur-tov-'tie [to sth.]' - txas tov-'tie to a pole', hur-xzr[againststh.]' ryaysk'er-'lean againsta wall'.","[14, 15]"

Connectivewords involve postpositions,sentenceconnectives,and particles.
As mentioned in section 3.1.2,postpositionsfollow the nouns and specifr
locative meaningsexpressedby casesuffixes,By their origin postpositions are
divided into nominal and verbal ones.Of thesetwo only nominal postpositions
can take casesuffixes.
Consider for example, the postposition <a-a> vyj, <nsn> wAj 'under',
which is derived from the noun <AD> vyj, <nso> waj'bottom', cf. (56), and
can take case sufifixes,cf. (57), and the postposition tulku I rulku'across,
through', which is derived from the verb rulku-'get into [sth.], get through
[sth.l', cf. (58), and cannot take any casemarkers, cf. (59).",[19]

take-rtuIn its first meaning the pronoun p'i can be used in relative sentencesinsteadof
any personalpronoun when the subject of the dependentverbal form (= participle) is coreferentialwith that of the head verbal form, cf. @2).The pronoun
p'i is not marked for number, but occuring as a subject or an object, it is
marked for casein the sameway as nouns, cf. (al).",[14]
"Lw/M lllZJNIVKHThe parts of compound nouns may combine in accordancewith the
patterns of the following phrases:(a) attribute + head nouq cf. t'rf,yr'fre' + mu
'boat' -+
t'tyrmu'steamer', pila'big' + Co'fish' -+ pilaio'sturgeon', (b) direct

[swh.j' + tun'
compounded in conformity with the pattern direct object + verb, the deriving
process is accompanied either by adding the suffixes <Ar> -s, <EsD> -r, <AD,
EsD>-f, -tt, cf. to'fish' + rlyrp-'hunt' + -s -+ iorpyrls'instrument for fishing',

Compounding of stems may also occur according to the pattern subject

case a stem of the compound word sometimes takes the suffix I cf. rlirgu

3,1.1.Numberand comitative
CurrentlyNivkh noun morphologydistinguishes
two numbers,i.e.,singularand
plural. One can assumethat originally there was also a dual number, which
tracesremainin the forms of comitative,personalpronouns,and imperative.
Singularwith its -o- markeris opposedto plural with the suffix <e.p> -ku/ 1u
/ -gu / -xu, <ESD>-kun / 1un / -gun/ -xun, <ESD,ttso> -kunu / lunu / -gunu
/ -xunu (one or anotherphoneticvariantof the suffix is chosenaccordingto
the rulesof morphophonological
alternation),cf.n'iyx-o'man'- n'i{y-gu'men',
'arrow'
k'u-o
k'u1un'arrows'. In somecasesplural forms are derivedby
reduplicationof a stem, cf. eri'river' - eri+eri'rivers',p'-nax {nrru-plank.bed}Lw/M 1I1I7NIVKH'one's'one's

'man' n'iyx-o {man-sc}
n'ivy+n'ivy-gu {man+man-nr}'men'. A noun which is
not a subject of the sentence(sometimesthe one which is a subject) may have
a singular form even though it refers to more than one referent, cf. (l), (13).

system divided into 26 classeswith different numeral forms for each class.
Numerals from 19 classesare used only for counting certain objects,e.g. boats,
sledges,nets, poles, etc. Numerals from other classesare used for counting
objectsunited into setson the basisof some sign, e.g.paired objects (eyes,ears,
hands, legs,skis, skulls, etc.), small round objects (arrow-heads,bullets, teeth,
nuts, berries,eggs,etc.), thin flat objects (leaves,blankets,robes,shirts, etc.). In
addition, there is a class for counting all objects that do not fit into any other
class.
The principal phonetic distinctions are fixed for the numerals up to 'five'
inclusively.They can be segmentedinto two components:the first component,
a numeral, is common for corresponding numerals of all classes,while the
secondone, a classifier,is specificfor each class.The corresponding numerals
of different classestherefore differ from one another first of all by their second
components, which are often relatable to a noun denoting an object which
counting given classis used for, cf. iu'family' - n'iztu 'one (family)', miztu'two

usually do not occur word-initially in the dictionary forms of native words but
only as a result of morphophonological alternations. The exceptions are, in
particular, some participlesdenoting the intensity of a quality, cf. tuzla'cold' duzla'very cold'. As for ssp, there are no voicelessunaspiratedplosivesin this
dialect, voiced plosives occuring instead, cf. <AD, EsD,NsD> pal, <sso> bal

alternationof highvowels [i], [y], [u] and non-highvowels [e], [a], [o]. Now
it has been virtually lost, but the traces of a vowel harmony can still be discerned in a number of transitive verbs with the pronominal direct object prefixes
i- and e-, It has been noted that the prefix i usually occurs in the verbs which,
besidesthis marker, contain only the vowels [u] and [y], e.g. illu-'be afraid
'clear
up, take away [sth.]', i-ily- 'pull [sb. / sth.]', whereas
[of sb. / sth.f', i-vrythe prefix e- is found only in the verbs with the vowels [a] and fol, e.g. e-sNo'be
squeamish[about sth.], have an aversion[for sb. / sth.]', elna-'oil [sth.]',
e-yro-'hang [sth.]'. Whenever such verb takes a direct object, the pronominal
prefix is deleted,with-this in some verbs lost vowels are restored, cf. i-y- 'kilI,

In the course of history of the language,two diachronic phonetic processeshave affectedconsonants.Both processesare attestedmainly in e.p.As a
result of the first process,nasals [n], [r;], [n'], [m] have disappearedin final
and medial segmentsof some words and morphemesof Ao, whereasin rSp and
ssDtheseconsonantshave remained,cf. <rs-o>pund'int - <ln> pud'id' ' [smth.]

<EsD> -kun / 1un / -gun / -xun - <AD> -ku / 1u / -gu / -ru - plural
suffix of nouns, pronouns, and verbs. In the course of the second process,
wordmedial voicelessfricatives [y] and [$] have been lost. The loss of these
consonants was compensatedin the corresponding words by prolonging of
precedingvowels.As a result,there has ariseda new phonologicalphenomenon:Lw/M lllt2NIVKHin some words of an, long vowels are now opposedto the short ones, cf. <Es.o,

Reflexive verbal forms are derived with the reflexive-determinative
pronoun p'i which cliticize on the verb as a prefix. Typically, reflexive verbs

"Map:, The Nivl:hs (*)LWM lllNIVKHNivkh culture was coastal-subarcticand characterizedprincipally by fishing,
hunting (primarily coastal hunting), gathering wild plants, some for medical
and religious purposes, dog-breeding and some reindeer-breeding,the bear
festival,birchbark implements, canoe building, the dog-drawn sled.
For a long time the territory of the Nivkh residencewas under Chinese
dominance (from l27l to l34l Mongol, later under Manchu), then it was a
part of RussianEmpire. From 1858,accordingto the Russian-|apanese
Treaty,
Sakhalin was under joint control of Russiaand Japan. After signing the new
Treaty in 1875, Russiatook complete dominion of Sakhalin.
Russian-Japanese
In 1905, as a result of the Russian-|apanese
war, Sakhalin south of the 50""
passedinto the hands of Japan and was transformed into the |apanesegovernorship Karafuto. At that time, there beganan intensivesettling of the island by
the ]apaneseimmigrants (about half a million). Before 1945,the total number
of the Nivkhs was about 4,000, of whom about 2,300 lived on the continent,
1,600 on Sakhalin north, and 100 on Sakhalin south in the |apanesepart. In
1945, after the conclusion of the SecondWorld War, southern Sakhalin was
included into the realm of the Soviet Union, and practically the entire fapanese
population was repatriated. Together with the fapanesea small number of the
Nivkhs moved out to Japanand settled on Hokkaido Island.
In the 1960-70s,important changestook place in the life of the Nivkhs
in the Soviet Union because of their forced resettling. Thus, in the lower
reachesof the Amur, owing to the catastrophic scarcity of the river as a fishing
basin, fishing collective farms and artels were liquidated. Currently, there exists
only one fishing farm, where a small number of the Nivkhs lives. For its part,
the Nivkhs (about 1,800 persons) have settled in many villages, towns, and
seaports. At present, there are no dense Nivkh settlements on the Amur,
excepting the village of Aleevka. At the same period, on Sakhalin, due to
amalgamation of collectivefarms taken place at that time, inhabitants of small
national villagesof the Shmidt peninsula(Nyvrvo, Muz'ma, etc.) were transported to the village of Nekrasovka, and inhabitants of the northern villages of
former Rybnovskij region (Vivski, Tamlavo, L'ugi, etc.) to that of Rybnoe.
Inhabitants of all national settlementsof the easternseacoastwere concentrated
in the town of Nogliki. Old villages were liquidated. Resettling has been carried
out despite unwillingness of inhabitants to desert their old villages, rich fishinggrounds and has causeda considerablemigration of population becausea lot of
families did not want to move out to new settlements. They preferred to settle
in towns and began to labour at industrial works. So, both in the Amur region
and on Sakhalin,the traditional professionsof the Nivkhs were more and more
replacedby other occupations.According to the data ofthe 1989generalcensus
of the population, there were 4,681 Nivkhs in Russia,of whom 2,008 lived on
Sakhalin. By comparison with the previous decade,the number of the NivkhLw/M lllNIVKHpopulation a little bit increased:according to the data of the previous 1979
generalcensusof the population, there were 4,420 Nivkhs in Russia.
One of the linguistic complications is the fact that Nivkh has four
dialects, namely, the Amur dialect (hereafter,eo), the East Sakhalin dialect
(hereafter, rs.o), the North Sakhalin dialect (hereafter, NsD), and the South
Sakhalin dialect (hereafter, ssD).AD and rs.o are rather different: their speakers
afErm that they do not understand each other. Ns.o (or the Shmidt dialect)
occupies an indermediate position between these two. As for sso (or the
Poronaisk dialect), it has essentialdifferences in phonology, grammar, and
vocabulary from the other three dialects, especiallyfrom ep. At the close of the
last century, the number of speakersof eo and that of the Sakhalin dialects
were roughly equal. Sincethe speakersof ep continually lived on the continent
in close contact with the Tungus-Manchu peoples, it is suggestedthat this
dialect is a result of an influence of Tungus-Manchu languagesupon the Nivkh
parent language.Among the Sakhalin dialects EsDwas most widely practised. It
was used by the Nivkhs settled all over Sakhalin,with the exception of some
villages on tlle nortir-western sea coast where NSD was spoken and some
settlementsin the south of the island where a small group of speakersof ss.o
lived. Ssp was used till recently by the Nivkhs who moved out from the
Poronaisk region to )apan after the SecondWorld War. Furthermore, one.of
the Sakhalin dialects (probably, NSo) was also spoken by the Nivkhs who lived
along the right sea coast of the continental part of the Amur estuary and the
Tatar Straight coast. The sketch is based mainly on the materials of e.p and rs-p.
The question of genetic relationship of Nivkh to any other language has
not been finally solved. Though there are marked some typological similarities
to fapanese,Tungus-Manchu, Turkic, Chukchi, and Native American languages,
it has so far been impossible to assignit to any known stock. Nivkh is generally
classified as Paleosiberian(or Paleo-Asiatic) *ith some other languagesof
Siberia and Far East, which form a group of isolated languageswithout any
particular relationship. It is thought that these languages were spoken in the
area before the arrival of the Tunguses and the Yakuts.
One may note different hypotheseson the question of Nivkh genesis.
According to one of them, the Nivkhs who had occupied extensiveareas in
Asia, under pressure from other peoples, were forced to leave for Sakhalin.
Moving of the Ainus pressedby the |apanesefrom the south of Sakhalin to its
north in turn led to partial return of the Nivkhs to the Amur region on the
continent. Another hypothesis suggeststhat the Nivkhs moved to the places of
their current residence from more northern Arctic regions. Thus, the Nivkhs
together with the Chukchis, the Koryaks, and the Itelmens (the Kamchadals) is
considered to be one of tribes related to American race, which secondarily
moved to Asia. After the autochthonous theory the Nivkhs are ancient abori-LW/M lllNIVKHgines of the lower Amur and Sakhalin,who previously occupiedmore extensive
territories. By archeologicaland ethnographical data, the population which
formed an ancient substratum of the lower Amur differed widely from other
ethnic groups by its economic tenor (fishing, dog-breeding)and was known to
the neighboursby the name of Gilyaki. As for settling of the Nivkhs on Sakhalin, according to Nivkh legends,after arriving on Sakhalin,they met there the
Ainus. For its part, Ainu legends talk about the people named Ton'chi, who
lived there in earlier times and, as a result of lengthy wars with the Ainus, was
forced to desertthe island. Archeologicaldata give cluesto the assumptionthat
the Ton'chis are related to ancient Eskimo tribes, while toponymic materials
convince that they were nobody else than the ancient Nivkhs.
Historically, the Nivkhs have been in close contact with the TungusManchu tribes, namely, with the Oroks (the Uiltas), the Nanais, the Evenks,
etc., on the Amur, and the Oroks and the Evenkson Sakhalin.That is found in
numerous loan-words and phonetic interference.Moreover, the SakhalinNivkhs
have been living for a long time in close touch with the Ainus, especiallywith
those who lived in the south of the island. The historical ties with the Russians
have been establishedsince the mid-l9th century, when those beganto settlein
the Far East of Asia and on Sakhalin. During the same period the Sakhalin
Nivkhs were contacting with the Japanese.
At the turn of the 20th century the language situation in the area was
characterized by an active multilingualism caused by various socio-cultural
reasons(joint residing,common forms of economic activities,mixed marriages,
etc.). However, Nivkh has had little effecton neighbouringlanguages.It is often
contended that the aboriginal neighbours of the Nivkhs easily acquired a
knowledge of all the other local languagesin use, except Nivkh. That is why, the
Nivkhs had to expressthemselvesin Ainu, Orok, etc., not in their own language,in their relationswith the neighbours.A generalrule which characterized
the contacts between the aboriginal population and the immigrants, was
communication in the languageof the latters. Though the original population
was dominated by stronger nationalities,due to their isolatedlife as hunters and
fishermen, they could keep their native languageand culture for a long time.
After the SecondWorld War, an active processof massiveRussification
of the indigenious peopleswas set in motion, completelychangingthe linguistic
situation. At present, all the Nivkhs who know their native language are
bilingual and speak fluent Russian as well. The languagedoes not have any
official state and, as a whole, has a low retention rate. Only 23.3% of the Nivkh
population regard Nivkh as their mother tongue. For all the others amongst
them Russianis the mother tongue. My selectedsociolinguisticinspection (315
persons) carried out in the town of Nogliki (Sakhalin Island) in 1989 demonknow and
stratesthat ca 75 persons(the youngestare 40 yearsold), i.e.,23.8o/o,Lw/M lllNIVKHuse Nivkh. Moreover, those bilinguals who claimed to speak Nivkh as their
primary language nowadays prefer Russian even in routine situations. The
knowledgeof the native languageremains a passive,rarely used reserve.As one
can see,at presentit tends to completeousting of Nivkh by Russian.Nevertheless,some attempts are being made to revive the Nivkh language.Since 1981,
Nivkh has been studied up to the third form in the boarding schools for
children from the ethnic minorities in Nogliki and Nekrasovka on sakhalin
Island. Due to extreme dispersionof native population on the Amur river, there
are no schoolswith the studying of Nivkh in that region. In the systemof high
education,a courseon Nivkh is read at the Department of Northern peoplesof
the RussianStatePedagogicalUniversity in St. petersburg.
Nivl:h folklore is rich in epics,tales,riddles, songs,and ditties. They talk
about fighting of the Nivkhs with mountain, forest, sea, sky, or underground
people,monsters (about a dozendifferent beings),and cannibals,about adventures during hunting and fishing, about getting a wife (probably, a forest, sea,
or slcy woman), bear festivals, etc. The most valuable data on Nivkh folklore
were publishedby L.Ya. Shternbergin 1908.In 1996,owing to the efforts of K.
Inoue and A.F. Majewicz the facsimile of B. Pilsudski's collection of Nivkh
folklore texts was brought out. Historically, Nivkh had no script. The written
languagebased on the Latin alphabet was introduced in 1930s for ao. Since
then, severalissuesof a newspaper,booklets, an arithmetic book, and primers
have appearedin Nivkh. However, this written languagehas not survived since
the Nivkhs preferred to write in Russian.Later (1953), the Latin alphabet was
abandonedand replacedby the Cyrillic alphabet.At the same time, the written
system for rsp was introduced. G.A. Otaina, V.M. Sangi,Ch.M. Taksami, and
G.l. Paklina published severalprimers for en and rsn. Stories in Nivkh (l9BZ)
were written by V.M. Sangi,who also translatedsome texts by A.S. pushkin.
The initial work on Nivkh is generallyconsidered a brief article by N.
Zeland (1866). In 1892, W. Grube published a work based on the materials
collectedby L. von Schrenkand P. von Glehn in 1854-56 during the expedition
organized by Imperial Academy of Sciencesto the Amur region. A great
number of linguistic and ethnografic materials on Nivkh was collected at the
turn of the century by L.Ya. Shternberg together with B. Pilsudski. Among
Russiangrammarianswho studied Nivkh in the 20th century one can mention
first of all E.A. Krejnovich andY.Z, Panfilov, as well as V.N. Savel'jeva,G.A.
Otaina, V.P. Nedjalkov, L.B. Gashilova,V.A. Ruschakov,and A.A. Burykin.
Russian-Nivkh(1965) and Nivkh-Russian(1970) dictionarieswere published by
V.N. Savel'jevaand Ch.M. Taksami. Different questions on Nivkh internal
reconstruction,phonology, grammar, genesis,and sociolinguisticsare discussed
in the works of R. Austerlitz, R. Iakobson, P.G. Moellendori K. Bouda, O.
Tailleur, B. Comrie, T. de Graaf, N. Akira, M. Takahashi,and T. Hattori.","[3, 4, 5]"

"Some Nivkh verbs, like i-trry-'give [sth. to sb.]', si-'put [sth. swh.]', j-ty-'sew
[sth. on sth.]', take two nominal objects.One of these is a prototypical direct
object, that is an affected patient. The other is construed semantically as an
indirect object, that is not an affected patient, which neverthelessgets coded
syntactically as a direct object, i.e., stands in the nominative. Sentenceswith
such verbs are characterized by the following word order: subject- direct object
- indirect object - verb, cf. (77-78):father-Notlp'-meut'u-on'-ykyn-oREFL-gun-NOMI-elder.brother-tlou'Father gave his gun(78) Ytk-o

'Ifperson
ILw/M lII-Sar$aroTable 6: lmperatire markers
As one can see from Table 6, there is no separatelsc imperative form in ESD.
It should be also noted that nowadays the lou imperative form with the
corresponding lou personal pronoun has practically vanished.
When the prescription is addressedto an elder or unfamiliar person, a
special polite form with the marker -nave (probably, the combination of the 2pl,
iterative marker -na- and the 2pr imperative marker -ve) can be also used, cf.
!'.
Ra-nave!'Drink [please]
According to the materials of the first third of the 20th century the
imperative paradigm in .espincluded only one 3PLform, namely, the form with
the suffix -!aro, which like the corresponding form with the suffrx -fazo in to
was used both for singular and plural. The number opposition of the 3 person
forms, when the suffu -$aro is retained in the capacity of the 3sc marker, and
the reduplicated 3sc imperative marker -Sar$aro is used as the 3pt marker,
seemsto have been developedunder the influence of Russian,where 3 person
imperative verbal forms are opposed by number.
The prohibitive meaning is marked either by the specialized negative
particle t'4 which precedes- directly or non-directly - the corresponding
'Drink!' T'a ra-ja! {nrr:n'an:Hrcdrinkimperative form, cf. Ra-ja! {drink-nar:2sc}
'Do
rur:2sc|
not drink!', or by the negativeverb lavr- / lpvr- incorporated into
'Do not
drink!'. The 2 person
the finite verb, cf. Ra-!avr-ja! {drink-Nrc-nan}
forms with the preventive meaning agree with the subject in number. The
suffixes <ln> -jra, -yjra, -ijra, -nyra, <ESD>-inyfra, -ja1raare used in singular,
'Do
cf. Zosftu-nyral{break-rnEv:sc} not breakl', while the suffixes <AD> -jtla,
-fitla / -ujtla. <ESD> -inyr1ta, -jarSta are used in plural, cf. Zosfu-jtlal {break'Do
not break!'. There are specialized markers of the permissive
nnrv:nr|
meaning in ao, the 2sc suffix being -gira, and the 2pr suffix being -girla, cf. (52):There are two non-finite verbal forms, namely, the participle and the converb.
Participle displays mainly the verbal morphology, having overt expressions of tense, aspect, number, and modality and usually constituting a verbal
form without a finite suffix, cf. p'ry n'ivx {comeman} 'man who is coming', ir''beast
ny rla {eat-Fwbeast}
which [sb.] will eat', rajulyt xauzul {write-nnrpaper}
'paper
'meat
covered with writing', ra-iny t'us {roast-MoDmeat}
which [sb.] is
going to rojrst'. In eD, a participle sometimes takes the suffix -k, cf. rlyyr-kl
n'ivi'man"" who'is'looking forr [sth.]'. The plural number of participlesis
marked by reduplication of the stem, cf. t'os( mu-o {breakboat-sc}'broken boat'

Converbs are characterizedby aspectand modality, but, as a rule, are not
marked for number and tense.They have the following meanings and suffixes:

"The meaning of the reflexive-determinativepronoun <AD, EsD,-wso> p'i is
conditioned by its syntacticposition: being a subject, it denotes 'myself,yourself,himseli, etc.',cf. (40), being an attribute (usuallyincorporated into a noun)
it denotes'one's(my, your, his, etc.)',e.g.p'-mu'one's boat', cf. also (41), being

"The principal modal meaningscan be indicated in the sentenceby the following
ways.
The meaning of intention or desire is marked in the verb by the suffix
<AD, EsD> -iny-, cf. N'i ra-iny-d iI drink-r'.roo-rrNi'I am going to drink'. In EsD,
this suffix may be followed in the verb structure either by the stem of the verb

/

cf. latp ra-iny'[I

For indicating the meaning of possibility the analpical form consistingof
the finite verb and the verb <en> j-yjm-, <EsD> j-ajm- {ool-know} 'know [sb. /

(82) N'i

verbs habecause,therefore', ho$o4an'then', hoSaror/ ho$arot'after,after that', etc. They

"2.4. Suprasegmentals
As it was mentioned in section 2,2, one can found short and long vowels in Ao,
the latters being arised as a result of the loss of fricatives. Besides that, prolonged pronouncing of vowels with an updrift tone may be used for expressing
the following: (a) intensity of a quality, e.g. 1arla'very fat', (b) duration of an
'rising
action, e.g. myr-kE
[for a long time]', (c) remotenessof a person or an
object, e.g. dd""that [very distant]'.
The position of stressis not constant though it tends to fall on the first
vowel of a word. In the same words in ,4-oand rsp the stress may fall on
different syllables, cf. <,qp> dmamd' - <EsD> qmdmnt'[someone] walks /
walked'. Sometimes the stress is used to distinguish lexical items from one
another, cf. ydunt'[someone] calls/ called'- Xailnt'[someone] dries / dried'.
In Nivkh, stressis bound to the suffixes of the vocative, the imperative, and
'Go
'Mother!',
Vi-jd!
conditional converb, which are alwaysstressed,cf. Ymyk-d!
(2sc)!', Vi-vd!'Go (2rl)!', Vi-!aj...'If [I] go...'respectively.
It is assumedthat Nivkh makes a distinctive use of two types of tones,
which are opposed in monosyllablesand polysyllables:(a) monosyllables- with
'face', (ii)
the following tones: (i) updrift, cf. ki'footwear', n'ivx'man', r1yn'k2.5. Morphophonology
All the consonants,excepting[t], [d], [n], becomepalatalizedbefore t}re vowels
[e] and [i]. The final voicelessfricative of the word usually becomesvoiced if
the next morheme or the word begins with a voiced fricative, a plosive, a
'hoase'sonant,or a vowel, cf. tyf
tyrt mf inside'the houser' - tyv-uin'in
tlre house' - tyrl yy""u-z'do not know2 the housel'. The voicelessfricative [h]
is found only word-initially. It becomes voiced between vowels, cf. huin'there,
not far away' - dyuin'there, far away', and is Iost in the position between a
consonantand a vowel, cf. ha$.'cap'- n'alg'my cap',
Nivkh is characterizedby the regular initial consonant alternation of
words (or morphemes) which is determined by the final segment of the preceding word (or morpheme). The various seriesof plosivesand fricatives (the
trills [rj and [il are conventionallyconsideredas fricatives) alternatewith one
another in the context. The systemof alternations involves all the consonants,
excepting sonants [m], [n], [n'], [r]1, [], Ul and the fricative [h]. Different
seriesof alternatingconsonantsare presentedin Table 3 (the consonantsin the
left columns occur in the dictionary forms of native words, while those in the

- mu 74omi'from one side of a boat'.
As for the initial consonant alternation of words, it is found only in the
following types of syntactic constructions:
(a) an attribute calls forth alternation in the following head noun that
begins with a plosive (principally, they can also begin with fricatives), cf.
alternationtpl.- [v] I tbl inthe noun pyn'x'soup' t'ustpyn'i 'beefl soup2'to' vyn'*'fishr soupr' - ovt' byn'*'flourL soupz',and alternation[t'] - lzl I

.kyxkyxtt'o7?'swan'sl head2' ytt zop?'drake'sl
headz'- iamt d'or1f'eagle'siheadr'.
(b) a direct object calls forth alternation in the following verb that begins
with a fricative (as a rule, transitives begin with fricatives, whereas intransitives
begin with plosives,see section 2.3), cf. alternation tvl - [pj / [b] in the verb
'repair2
vyyvyy-'repair, treat': kil vyyyyy-2 'repair2 a footwearl' - tyf pn""n2
a housel', oylat bylvyy2'treat2 a childl', and alternation [z]

verb zosN-'break':^IaNl
zosls-z
a skil' - luvrr t'osf-2'break2a spoonl' 'breakz
tlir' d'osN-""
a cupr'.
As it was mentioned above,the alternationsare conditioned by the final
segmentof the precedingword or morpheme. In this connection it is necessary
to take notice of so-called ""historical"" alternations,which take place after the
words or morphemes historically ended in the nasal sonants [nl or [U]. It
would be recalled that these sonants are lost in a number of words in eo and
remained on the whole in EsD,NsD,ssD(seesection 2.2). Though lost, the final
sonants in question still determine the initial consonant alternation of the
following word or morpheme in ao. Languagedata demonstratethat in modern
A.othere is only one kind of alternationswhich involves alternationsboth after
the lost sonants and after the sonantswhich have remained in en (= ""strong""
sonants). On the contrary what is typical about ssD are two different kinds of
alternations,one of which is causedby the sonantswhich are nowadayslost in
Ao (- ""weak"" sonants) and another by the ""strong"" ones. EsD and ws.oconstitute to a certain extent an intermediate area since they display mixed and
unregulated picture of alternations.In ap and ssp the consonantsalternatein

As one can see, the system of initial consonant alternations in ssD is
somewhatdifferent from that in AD and has a more complex structure. In this
dialect the alternations after sonants are not only conditioned by a phonetic
nature of the initial consonantand the type of syntacticrelationshipsbetween
words at which boundariesthe alternation takesplacebut also reflect a historical processof sonant loss in NivLh.","[7, 8]"
