orthography, but is also very attractive for the native speakers, since
preservation of their language is very important to many of them. Oral
literature was gathered: proverbs, riddles, folktales, which is an excellent means

there are different processes by which nouns are derived from verbs (5.11.1).
Four morphological strategies are described, three of which are action-related.
The fourth strategy, tonally constrastive with one of the three action-related
strategies, marks the result of the action or an object related to the action,
Secondly, there is participant-noun formation (5.11.2). A distinction is madebetween participant nouns on the one hand, and agent nouns with expressed
abject. Two strategies of the former are described, and one of the latter,Finally, nominalisation processes take place in order to make the members of
a particular class of words take a nominal function in the sentence, In. thisway, modifiers, verbal modifiers, numerals, and postpositional phrases can benominalised. When nominalised, they may function in possessive constructions,
postpositional phrases, or as head of a subject or object noun phrase. All theseNounsconstituents undergo one and the same process of nominalisation, which is
described in’ 5.11.3.
§.11.1 VerbalThere are four strategies to derive non-participant nouns from verbs:

VERBS AND VERBAL MORPHOLOGA major division into two classes of postpositions can be made: postpositions
which take a nominal element as modifier: noun, noun phrase, or pronoun
(8.2), and postpositions which take an oblique phrase as modifier: a temporal
or locative modifier, or a postpositional phrase (8.3).needs to be subdivided into two classes according to the set of pronouns usedThe first group of postpositions, those functioning with a nominal modifier,as modifier in the postpositiona) phrase. Firstly, non-derived postpositions takethe regular personal pronouns as modifiers (8.2.1). The other class consists ofmodified by a noun or nounphrase, however, both the non-derivedinalienable nouns functioning as postpositions. They are modified by the set
of inalienable possessive pronouns (8.2.2). The resultant postpositional phrase
is tonally different from # noun phrase. In addition, there are a few
postpositions with irregular paradigms when modified by a pronoun (8.2.3).postpositions and those derived from inalienable nouns immediately follow theWhennoun or noun phrase and there is no apparent distinction between these two
ciasses of postpositions,For clarity of description, the postpositions derived from inalienable nouns are
subdivided into three sections. The first group consists of three postpositions
derived from body parts, which have two tonally contrastive forms each. The
difference can be explained in terms of directional versus locational and
general location versus specific location (8.2.2.1). The second group consists
of five locative inalienable nouns which function as postpositions (8.2.2.2).
Finally, there are a few compound postpositions whose second element is aheight assimilation and [ATR] harmony are mentioned whenever applicable.postposition derived from an inalienable noun (8.2.2.3). Features like vowelPosipositional phrases must be nominalised when they function in a nominal
slot (8.4). Within the clause, they may function as subject or object. Certainverbs require their subject or object to be a nominalised postpositional phrase.","[313, 314]"

2. The form araébha ‘seven’ seems in fact a combination of ar’ ‘eight’ followed
by ibhw ‘three’. If we look at the traditional numeral system, 9.3.1.3 below,there is a morpheme, -vi, which marks ‘lacking one’, or ‘one below’ the numeralto which it is attached, from otsi ‘twelve’ onward (otsi-vi, 12-1=11). In the
case of arébhé ‘seven’, ibhw may have taken on the same function: its originat
meaning being ‘three’, ic, one below the first unit of four. Following that,
one’, in this case from eight, ie., seven.attached to aré ‘eight’, which is the next unit of four, its meaning is ‘lacking3, The etymology of ‘nine’ is a bit clearer. The recognisable parts of ardgyétdi
are aré ‘cight’, and -tdi, ‘one’, which together make up ‘nine’. The middie
part, -gyé-, is not entirely clear. Some suggest that it originates from -do, ‘head,on’, which is pronounced gyo in the northern speech variety. Influenced byOrderthe [+ATR] front vowel in -tdi, gyo acquires a [+ ATR] front vowel, thereby
keeping its original vowel height: gye. There is free variation in fast speech
between dragyétdi and drigyétdi. In the latter form even the antepenultimate
syllable has exchanged its back vowel for a front yowel.","[362, 363, 364]"

obligatory element in conjunction with the free-standing subject pronoun. The
existence of both subject pronouns and agreement markers’on the verb in

to a diachronic development, possibly influenced by the structure of
neighbouring Bantu languages, by which the original free-standing pronounbecameagreement marker in conjunction with a free-standing pronoun (the “long

Pata7.8.6 O-Initial and a-Initial Verb StemsIt was mentioned above (7.8) that in general, if a verb has an O-initial or an
a-initial stem, that stem represents the base form from which other
stems
may
be derived. A verb root containing the vowel a always has a stem-initial
a,Verb roots with any other vowel may have O- or a- as stem-initial vowel.
Inmost cases, there is only one verb stem: either with O- or with a- stem-initially,
There are, however, about twenty roots which are found both with stem-initial
O- and a-, and whose meanings are closely related. It does not seem possible
to state unambiguously whether the O-initial stem or the a-initial stem is the
base form in these cases. A closer Jook at these pairs shows that some maybe used interchangeably; in other cases, there

Ddra-dha and Njaw-dha), Dja-dha is the speech variety which is used for radiobroadcasts as well as for the written standard of the language. Rrkpa is
considered by the people as a subgroup of Pi, and probably points more to
an ethnic subdivision, since their speech forms are almost identical. [1 must
be said here that those Lendu speakers who have written about their own
