15 Noun phrase structure
A noun phrase is a noun functioning as head with optional modifiers and
particle, or a pronoun. The demonstrative is not considered a constituent of
the noun phrase but is discussed in section 15.3.2.
15.1 Marking for case. The subject of a transitive verb is marked with the
enclitic -a *ERG' when this constituent occurs immediately before the verb
and is not associated with a demonstrative.

whereas in (293) it governs a noun phrase and is itself governed by the
dependent verb, which in this case is the dependent form of the auxiliary
hi, glossed here as 'be'. There is no significant difference in meaning
between the two uses of kaimoni.
There is, however, a significant pragmatic function served by the use of
the equative clause in all these examples (288-293). As noted in 14.6 and
section 9.2.3, whenever an equative clause is used in the sentence-initial
position, as a single constituent of that sentence, it adds a degree of
prominence to that constituent, whether it refers primarily to a participant
or, as in these examples, to a proposition. It has much the same effect as a
pseudo-cleft construction in English, so that (288), for example, could be
glossed something like: 'It is because I was hungry that she gave me food'.
The hi construction is also used as the second in a two-clause sequence
to express result. In this case, both clauses are main clauses, marked as
such by the verb-final thematic suffix.

"Finally in the constituent order parameter, the S and O nominals can be
postposed to the verb and right-dislocated. In this case, they retain their
case-marking enclitics. The pragmatic function here is that of clarification of
the referent, which is only marked for person, gender or number in the
verb of the main predication. Additional prominence is thus given for
purposes of disambiguation or emphasis.

"If the object is plural and animate then the plural object pronoun
obligatorily precedes the verb. A noun phrase object may also occur and
usually precedes the pronoun. In that case, both the noun phrase and
pronoun are usually tagged with -ra. This can result in either OVS order
(9) or SOV order.

The noun phrase part of the plural object may also occur following the
verb, leaving the pronoun in the immediately preverbal position. In this
case, only the pronoun has the -ra enclitic, but the noun phrase occurs with
the plural demonstrative.

soldier13 Ditransitive, The distinction between transitive and ditransitive clauses is
that in the latter there is a double object construction,
The enclitic -re OBJ' marks the (semantically) indirect object in the
immediately preverbal position. The (semantically) direct object, i.e.,
patient, is tagged with another enclitic, -a 'demoted object' (DEMOT:O), or
occurs with a demonstrative. In addition, the ditransitive verb is usually
clearly marked as such by the presence of one or more derivational affixes
(sect. 18.5.8).
The basic word order in ditransitive clauses is:
(S) OBJ-ra V AUX (DEM) DEMOT:O(-a)
The number, gender, person and noun class agreement remains the same
as for a transitive clause. An auxiliary verb hi- follows the main verb and
may be affixed for number, person, gender, noun class and theme, the
latter agreeing with the element in the demoted object for gender. Should
this be a complement clause, then the agreement marking is always
feminine singular. The main verb always has a dependent suffix when
followed by an auxiliary verb (sect. 18.8.2).

"15.2 Noun classes, gender, number and possession (genitives). These four
categories-class, gender, number and possession-interact with each other, so
that it is necessary to discuss them all together.
Nouns can be classified into eight different subclasses on the basis of:
masculine vs. feminine gender, non-ka- vs. ^a-NOUN CLASS and alienable
vs, inalienable possession. (See Table 1).

possessionThere is no distinguishing feature on the noun to indicate its gender, or
class, or number. Gender is shown by demonstratives and by the final suffix
on verbs and adjectives (-nil-na or -hil-ha) (sect. 18.4), Noun class is shown
by a ka- prefix on the noun modifier and verb. Number on inanimate
objects must be shown by a quantifying modifier. Larger animals and
humans show plural prefixes on modifiers and verbs. Smaller animals are
usually treated in the same way as inanimate nouns.
The demonstrative associated with each noun indicates its gender and
number;

The ka- nouns form a small subclass that do not seem to have any
semantic link with each other. Out of certain classificatory lists (e.g. birds,
fruit, objects) a few items will be ka- nouns. (Out of 45 animals 2 are ka-,
out of 80 birds 8 are ka-, out of 46 reptiles and insects 10 are ka-, and out
of 84 fish none are ka-,)
To give specific examples, all the following are ka- nouns: katopahian

kasi'i 'alligator*, kaboka 'type of ant', moka'a'a 'spider', barasia
'watermelon', jaro'oa 'corn', kabahai 'thigh', kajoi 'intestines', jokira 'salt',
kojira 'spoon*, kanava 'canoe', vanami 'paddle'.

agreement with a ka- class noun. (The class marker normally has the form
ka- (377a), but is sometimes a- (383), ko- or ki-.)
The agreement is governed by the head noun in the case of noun
modifiers (377a) and by the intransitive subject (377b) or the direct object
(377a) in the case of the ka- verb prefix.

"The verb in (141), 'bai 'eat', is normally intransitive. The final suffix, -ha
'THEME', agrees with vi- '3PL'. Siri amabokhoni 'turtle elbow* is marked
as direct object by the enclitic -ra. This form of prominence marking occurs
when a grammatically intransitive verb is used in a semantically transitive
way. The overt object may only occur clause final and is marked by the
object enclitic -ra. It may not occur in the normal pre-transitive-verb
position.
9.2.2 Uses of the particle vani. The particle vani is postposed to a noun
phrase or pronoun to indicate that the referent is being selected out of
other possible choices, or is in contrast with other referents in the
immediate context. The phrase with vani may be the subject or object of
the clause, and it is always pre verbal and usually in the clause -initial
position. There are three basic types of construction, each expressing a
different degree of prominence with respect to the referent
First, να/ΐϊ may occur alone following the noun phrase or pronoun. In this
case, the contrast or selection is being stated or implied, but without any
special prominence.

"14.3 Relative clauses. A relative clause has an inflected verb with the suffix
-fa. This suffix is glossed 'NONTHEME* when it occurs in a main verb and
'DESC when it occurs as a nominal modifier. In this function, it can often
be regarded as a simple adjective (sect. 15.3), as well as a relative clause.
The head noun which the clause modifies may be the subject (310, 311),
direct object (312, 313), or oblique constituent (314, 315) of the main
clause. There do not appear to be any restrictions on the syntactic
functions which the relativized constituent can have in the relative clause,
the following examples illustrating subject (310, 311, 312), object (313, 314)
and genitive (315) relativization. The relative clause normally follows the
noun it modifies (but can have another constituent of the noun phrase
following it, as in (314) and (315)), and the case markers -ra OBJ' and -a
'ERG' (311, 312) follow the relative clause when this is the final constituent
of the whole noun phrase and when that phrase functions as object or
subject, respectively, of the main clause in the preverbal position.

"9.2 Noun phrase marking to express prominence in relation to participant
reference. There are five principal devices used to highlight noun phrase
referents: variation in the order of clause constituents (9.2.1); postposing of
the particle vani 'CONTRAST, SELECTION' to the noun phrase (9.2.2);
placement of demonstrative in preverbal position (9.2.3); use of special
subject-emphasis pronouns (9.2.4); and the use of certain forms of hi 'AUX'
immediately following the noun phrase to express a contrastive focus
function (9.2.5).
9.2.1 Variation in the order of clause constituents. The basic orders of
clause constituents are (intransitive) VS and (transitive) SVO (sects. 1.1 and
1.2). Variations from these orders result in one or both of the S and Ο
nominale being marked as either more prominent or less prominent than in
the unmarked (basic) orders. Another common order in transitive clauses is
OVS (133), in which the Ο is given more prominence as a marked topic
by being fronted, and the S is demoted to postverbal position; the Ο is also
morphologically marked by the -ra case-marking enclitic (sects. 1.2 and
15.1). Both the S and O nominals can be further demoted by being omitted
from the clause (134).

1 Word order
The syntactically distinct clause types are: intransitive, transitive, ditransitive
and copular-equative,
1.1 Intransitive. The basic word order of the intransitive clause is VS. The
subject noun phrase obligatorily contains a demonstrative in the initial
position. There is no other form of case-marking.
There is no overt marking to distinguish an intransitive active verb from
an intransitive stative verb. The verb (frequently) and the demonstrative
(always) agree in number, gender and class with the noun of the subject
constituent (sects. 15.2 and 18.4).

Download Date | 3/29/17 5:37 PMPaumari 165There are two other constituent orders that frequently occur in transitive
clauses: OVS and SOV. In both, the object occurs immediately before the
verb and is marked by the enclitic -ra OBJ'. This signals that the
accusative system is now operating, and it is mutually exclusive with the
ergative system, so that the subject now does not receive any form of
case-marking and can occur before the object or after the verb, but cannot
occur in the immediately preverbal position (sect. 15.1). The pragmatic
conditions under which these orders occur are discussed in section 9.2. In
these -ra constructions, it is the subject that controls the number and
gender agreement in the verb-final suffix and the demonstrative (see (7); in
(8) the verb-final suffix is -ki 'NONTHEME', which is neutral as regards
gender). A demonstrative never co-occurs with -ra in the object noun
phrase in this preverbal position. See Chapman (1981) and Derbyshire
(1983 and 1986).

Where the predicate complement contains as its nucleus a dependent
verb form or a nominal derived from a verb, the gender distinction is
neutralized and the feminine demonstrative is used as the neutral form.
This rule applies irrespective of the gender of subject or object nominals
that may occur with the dependent verb. Either hida, the ""near"" deictic, or
Ida, the ""far"" deictic, may be used.

There are two types of predicate nominal involving kaimoni 'PURP* that
result in embedded equatives which function as adverbials. In one, the
particle kaimoni governs a noun phrase and the demonstrative takes the
gender of the head noun (337). In the other, kaimoni governs a dependent
verb construction and the demonstrative then has neutral (feminine) form
(338).

In these embedded constructions, the equative clause is always the first
constituent of the main clause. This fits the pattern of fronting constituents
and adding certain elements (in this case mani + DEM) for the purpose
of emphasis, contrast, or prominence of some kind. In the case of the
embedded equative construction, as we suggest in 14.1.3, the effect seems
to be much the same as the pseudo-clefting device in English, See also
section 9.2.3.
The equative clause, as a constituent of the main clause, usually stands
alone, without any enclitic or particle following it. Occasionally, as in (339),
a particle (yiahania) may follow, and it seems to function as part of the
(adverbial) constituent

When the predicate nominal is a dependent verb construction, this type
of equative clause never occurs as an independent main clause or sentence.
Its grammatical function appears to be restricted to the three categories:
subject, passive agent and adverbial; and the semantic functions seem to be
limited to agent, cause-reason and purpose. Equative clauses with noun
phrase complements can occur as independent main clauses (334a, b), and
also as direct objects (340), as well as subjects (341).

In the following subsections we discuss the various types of subordinate
clause constructions that occur in the language, distinguishing them primarily
by their syntactic function and/or the way the constructions are internally
organized: adverbial clauses (14.1); complement clauses (14.2); relative
clauses (14.3); nominalized verb constructions (14.4); indirect and direct
quotation (14,5); embedded equative clauses (14.6); and subordination by
juxtaposition of certain conditional clause constructions (14.7). We close the
section (14.8) with a few examples of complex, multi-embedded clauses, and
other examples of these are scattered through the other subsections.
14.1 Adverbial clauses. The main characteristic of adverbial clauses is the
verb-final suffix, which is either -vim 'DEP:TRANS' or -nij-na
'DEP:INTRANS, f/m'. This replaces the verb-final thematic suffixes that
occur in main clauses (sect. 18.6.1). Otherwise, the dependent verb has all
the potential for affixation of a main verb. This dependent verb form is not
restricted to adverbial subordinate clauses. It can also function as a subject,
object, or equative predicate complement (14.2). It also occurs at times as
the nucleus of an independent clause, with or without a form of the
auxiliary verb hi following it, but without any main verb to which it is
subordinated.
It is this latter characteristic that is common to the three main types of
adverbial clause construction we discuss below: dependent verb form alone
(14.1.1); dependent verb form and subordinating particle (14.1.2); and
dependent verb form and hi auxiliary construction (14.1.3). In the case of
the subordinating particles, they sometimes occur with thematic suffixes
instead of dependent suffixes on the verb. These adverbial clauses have the
same word order patterns as main clauses. They most often consist only of
the verb, but it is common to find a single nominal constituent plus verb,
and the sequences VS, VO and OV all occur frequently. It is rare to find
more than one nominal.
There is one other type of adverbial clause which occurs occasionally.
This is the participial, in which neither the thematic suffixes nor the
dependent suffixes occur (14.1.4).
14.1.1 Adverbial clauses in which the dependent verb form occurs without
particle or auxiliary. This is the most generally used type of adverbial
clause and it covers a wide semantic range, including: time (259, 260),
location (261), purpose (262), manner (263), and reason (264).","[64, 65]"
"The Ο nominal is given special prominence by being fronted and
left-dislocated. In this case it does not have the case-marking enclitic -ra.
The S can precede (137) or follow (138) the verb, or be omitted (139).

"3 Ellipsis
In a discourse or dialogue the subject and object nominals are frequently
omitted if the referent can be understood from the context. The context
may be the immediate discourse or the social setting. Kinship terms may be
used as referents, implying that the listener is familiar with the kinship
system and the speaker's role in it. One person may be named to
represent a whole group of participants.
When a native speaker, who is not the author, is checking a text, the
checker is often unable to supply specific information. This shows that
omitted material is not always recoverable, even by someone from the
culture.

following the verb may be deleted, the gender agreement shown by the

18.6 Other categories
18.6.1 Verb-final suffixes. All verbs have one of a small set of suffixes in
the final position which simultaneously indicate several different types of
information, such as primary/foreground vs. secondary/background; dialogue
vs. monologue; declarative vs. imperative; main vs. subordinate clause;
establishment of topics and settings; description; gender; and number. They
fall into three main groupings: thematic suffixes, imperative suffixes and
dependent verb suffixes.
1) Thematic suffixes:
-hi/-ha 'THEME': monologue event line, remote in time/space
from the speaker, conditional:

"15.4 Nominalizations. Most verbs can be nominalized by the addition of a
verb-final derivational suffix. Verb-final theme and dependent suffixes (sect,
18.6.1) do not co-occur with these nominalizing suffixes,
Most intransitive verb roots and a few transitive roots take the
nominalizer ~i. The resulting form can be possessed, this being marked by
the addition of one of the set of the alienable possession prefixes (15.2).
The focus of this nominalization is on the action or state, or the result of
the action or state. Examples:

followed by an inflected form of the auxiliary verb ni (sect 18.8.1). Their
roots can also have -ni suffixed to them to form a nominalization, which
can take the alienable set of possession prefixes. An example is the root

constituents, which are discussed in section 9,2.
The main differences between intransitive and transitive clauses are:
—the object is obligatorily absent in an intransitive clause,
whereas it is always structurally present in a transitive clause
even though it is sometimes not overtly expressed.
—case-marking clitics occur in transitive clauses, but never in an
intransitive clause.
—the 3SG. person prefix hi- occurs in transitive clauses as part
of the ergative-marking system, but it never occurs in intransitive
clauses.
—in the imperative mode the 2SG person suffix is omitted in
intransitive clauses but occurs in transitive clauses.
1.2 Transitive. The basic word order is SVO. When this basic pattern is
used, the ergative system always operates, so that the subject is marked by
the enclitic -a 'ERG' and the object noun phrase has a demonstrative in
the initial position (sect. 15.1).
In this constituent order the subject noun governs the person prefix on
the verb for person and number, and the object noun governs the number
and gender of the verb-final suffix and the demonstrative.

The subject and/or object phrases may be omitted in the surface
structure when the context makes clear who the referent is, but the omitted
phrase(s) must be considered structurally present since it/they still govern
the number, gender, person and noun class agreement in the verb and/or
demonstrative. In (6), the feminine form of the verb suffix -hi THEME' is
governed by the omitted object noun referring to a species of palm fruit.

"9.2.3 Placement of demonstrative in preverbal position. In the pragmatically
least marked clauses, the demonstrative is associated with the noun phrase
that follows the verb, whether this is the subject or the object, and it never
also occurs preverbally in the same clause (sects. 1.1, 1.2 and 15.3.2). There
are two ways in which it may be associated with noun phrases in the
preverbal position, and in each case it serves to give special prominence to
the referent of the noun phrase.
In the first construction, the demonstrative follows the noun phrase. It
then has the same form as an equative clause. (The copula mani may also
occur in these embedded equative constructions, just as in the simple
equative clause—see section 1.4, and compare section 14.6 for more
complex embeddings involving equative and subordinate clauses.) The
function of this placement of the demonstrative is to draw special attention
to the identity of the referent in the noun phrase, which may be the
subject (148) or object (149) of the clause.

AH the personal pronouns in the first and second person consist of a root
or enclitic and a person prefix: ho- '1SG', i- '2SG', han- '1PL' and a'oni'2PL'. The root to which these are affixed determines the kind of pronoun.
Either the demonstrative or the emphatic pronoun is used in the third
person. The demonstratives are: ida/oni/hida *3SG,f; ada/o/hada '3SGfm';
and adani/hadani '3PL' (see sect 15.3.2). The emphatic pronouns are

16.1 Subject pronouns. An unmarked clause does not have a free subject
pronoun because the person is marked by a verbal prefix. The subject
pronouns are therefore part of the pragmatic information system which is
discussed in section 9.2. Subject pronouns are either ""contrast/selection"" or
""emphatic"" forms.
The contrast/selection pronouns have the root vani 'CONTR' and almost
always occur clause initial.

Shirley Chapmanand
Desmond C. Derbyshire
Summer Institute of LinguisticsIntroduction
The Paumari tribe is located in the State of Amazonas in Brazil. There are
three main groups. Approximately 270 live on the Purus River, 50 on the
Ituxi River and 200 on the Tapaua River. The latter group does not have
contact with the other two groups. The Purus and Ituxi River groups have
occasional contact with each other. They are all semi-nomadic fishermen
travelling extensively within their own area. There are minor dialectal
differences, mostly regarding vocabulary» among the three groups. The
material used for this analysis was obtained during prolonged contact
(1964-84) with the Paumari living on the Purus River. Some members of
this group had originated on the Ituxi River and the Sepatini River.
Paumari is classified as an Arauan language, possibly remotely related to
the Arawakan family.
It appears that the Paumari began to have regular contact with
non-Indian travellers about 1900. During the past 50 years the number of
Portuguese speaking settlers in the area has steadily increased. This
increasing contact has led the Paumari into a negative attitude towards
their own language and culture and the adoption of many non-Indian
beliefs and customs. For example, their houses are now all built on land,
whereas traditionally they lived on raft houses; they have adopted local
patterns of dress and use many imported items (cloth, cooking and fishing
equipment, tools, kerosene, sugar, salt, etc.).
The language change is perhaps the most significant and disturbing. All
of the Paumari speak a complete mixture of Paumari and Portuguese. A
sentence is frequently a total mixture of both languages, the grammar of
neither being preserved. Some of the Paumari language spoken by the
older people is no longer used or even known by the younger generation,
yet no one has an adequate mastery of Portuguese grammar or vocabulary.
This process is more advanced among the Paumari on the Tapaua"" River,Brought to you by | Cambridge University Library

speak Paumari.
This analysis reflects the language, as far as possible, in its pre-modified
form. Numerous texts (over 200) have been collected on tape, transcribed
and analyzed. These were given by a cross-section of the people, old and
young, men and women. Texts were mostly first person experiences,
legends and letters. The person who gave the text was usually the one who
helped to transcribe it and who frequently edited out the Portuguese and
corrected the grammar that had been changed as a result of the mixture.
Most texts have been further edited or corrected by someone other than
the original speaker. In the initial stages there were no literate Paumari,
but now the readers are able to check older texts and write short stories.
Because the writers are consciously trying to write in one language there is
less of a mixture than in the daily spoken language.
The process of acculturation and devaluation of the Paumari culture and
language was very far advanced before the initial contact by Chapman and
Mary Ann Odmark in 1964. Continuing contact was made possible through
a contract between the Summer Institute of Linguistics and the Indian
Department (Fundacäo Nacional do Indio) of the Brazilian government.
We would like to acknowledge the contribution that has been made at
different times on various aspects of the language by Mary Ann Odmark,
Chapman's partner for many years in the Indian area, and by the following
consultants: Joan Boswood, Eunice Burgess, Thomas Crowell, Irvine Davis,
Robert Dooley, Joe Grimes, Ivan Lowe, and Mary Ruth Wise. For some of
the morphosyntactic characteristics presented here, see Derbyshire (1986),
which usually gives a more concise statement, but occasionally develops a
topic more fully than this description does (e.g., case marking of nominals).
The language material for this paper was gathered by Chapman, who
also did most of the analysis and preliminary writing. Derbyshire
contributed to the analysis and writing of the final manuscript.","[1, 2]"
"The final example is clearly a case of ellipsis of the verb. The demoted
object may be any suitable noun, but never an embedded clause. Example
(235) is probably an ellipsis also and the appropriate verb is sometimes
added.

different location.

"In the second type of construction, the demonstrative precedes or
replaces the noun phrase. In this case, the demonstrative is always the first
constituent of the clause and functions to give emphasis to a topic that has
already been established in the discourse. It may refer to the subject (150)
or object (151) of the clause.

The passive construction is clearly intransitive and differs from the
corresponding active (transitive) construction in the following ways:
a) Neither the ergative nor object marking enclitics occur.
b) The 3SG prefix bi-, associated with the ergative case-marking
system, does not occur.
c) The object of the active clause becomes the subject of the
passive, and an optional agentive phrase marked by the enclitic
-a may occur. That this is not the ergative marker is clear from
the postverbal position that this constituent has in the passive
construction.
d) There is an auxiliary verb hi, which co-occurs with one of two
types of subordinate verb form, either a nominalized form,
marked by the suffix -hi 'NOMLZR' (74), or a dependent clause
marked by the suffix -nil-na (DEP:INTRANS( (78) (sect. 14.1). It
is always the dependent intransitive suffix, never the dependent
transitive, that occurs in this construction.

can be embedded as a limited number of constituent types in a main
clause: subject, passive agent and adverbial clause. In this subsection we
discuss some general characteristics of these embedded equatives.
Equative clauses are described in section 1.4. Only those clauses that
have the copula mam are involved in these embeddings. In every case,
mani is followed by a demonstrative. In the simple equative clause, the
predicate complement is a noun phrase and the demonstrative agrees with
the head noun of that phrase.",[83]

nahina is the most general of the question words, with a wide
distribution of meaning and function. In non-interrogative contexts it may
mean 'thing' or ni-nahina 'nothing'. It may be possessed kodi-nahina 'my
personal possessions'. In a question it may function as an interrogative
adjective (181) or an interrogative pronoun. It is never inflected. It may
occur as the only constituent of a nominal question phrase (179), but it
frequently occurs in an equative identificational clause with or without mani
'COP' (cf. 180).
The following examples show nahina as: a noun phrase subject (176); a
predicate complement in an equative clause where the whole equative
clause functions as subject (177), direct object (178), or demoted object
(180); modifying a head noun in a temporal phrase (181); an oblique
constituent with a source (182) or instrument (183) function; or as a direct
object with the enclitic -ra (184, 185).

"9 Pragmatic and discourse characteristics
Certain types of discourse-conditioned phenomena are referred to in other
sections. See especially sections 13 (anaphora), 16 (pronouns), and 21.2
(particles). Here, we will describe some of the devices used to express
varying degrees of pragmatically-motivated prominence marking. This is
mainly in relation to noun phrases, demonstratives and pronouns, where a
particular referent is highlighted (Chapman 1981). We begin first, however,
with choices relating to certain verb suffixes, which signal prominence and
information status of the complete clause in the discourse context.
9.1 Verb marking to express prominence and information status of the
clause. The verb-final suffixes (sect. 18.6,1) have a variety of functions, but
they primarily indicate the status of the information being conveyed in that
predication in relation to the whole discourse. Thus, -hil-ha 'THEME, f/m*
is used mainly for primary, foregrounded information. This is normally
information that is on the main theme or event line of monologue/narrative-type discourse. It is given additional prominence (that is,
marked as being especially important) by the co-occurrence of the aspect
suffix -fi/-'a (sect. 18.2). In (128), the first clause has the final thematic
suffix, -ha, without the aspect suffix, but the second clause has both, -'i-hi,
thus signalling that while both clauses are on the main event line, the
second is more important in relation to that part of the discourse.

The question suffix -ti rarely occurs in modem Paumari, except in this

10.2 Content questions. The question word always occurs clause initial or
after a clause-initial demonstrative. The answer which substitutes for the
question also occurs clause initial. The term 'question word' refers to the
head of the question phrase. The term question phrase refers to the head,
along with other constituents (noun, enclitic, demonstrative, auxiliary verb,
or particle).
There are basically two kinds of question phrase; a nominal question
phrase and a verbal question phrase.
10.2.1 A nominal question phrase is understood to ask about a nominal
nuclear constituent, unless all the nuclear information is present in the
context. If the nuclear constituents are all present then the nominal
question phrase is directed towards a peripheral constituent of time,
location, or instrument -mani 'Q' is optional in content questions. The
question words that occur in the nominal question phrase are: nahina
'what?, who?', hana hi-nil-na 'which?', niha-fori 'when?, how much?' and
hana 'where?1.
hana is a locative interrogative pronoun and has the optional suffix -ja
'directional in time or space', -ja may be reduplicated -jaja without any
distinguishable change of meaning.

the class of body parts. Members of this class usually require the addition

function as verb stems without the addition of any derivational affix or verb

are discussed in section 14.
15.3.2 Demonstratives. Each nominal phrase potentially has a demonstrative linked to it. It is easier to describe the function and distribution of
demonstratives if they are not considered as part of the nominal phrase,
but as a separate constituent in the clause.
The same set of demonstratives may function as a locative (e.g., 'here',
'there') or a pronoun ('him', 'her'), or as a link between an embedded
clause or demoted object and the main clause predication (416).
The demonstratives are:
feminine masculinepluralhidahadahadanioniο
ado.adaniida'this, these, her, him, here
(where the speaker is), now'
'that, there (where the hearer is)'
'that, those, them, there
(distant from listener or
speaker or nonspecific in time
or location)'A demonstrative locative may co-occur in the same clause with a locative
phrase but they are two separate locative constituents and as such may
both be marked with the oblique enclitic (403, 404). Only when a
demonstrative stands as a locative phrase can it be marked with the
oblique enclitic -a (403—405).

21.2 Discourse particles. There are three particles used to mark boundaries
in narrative. There appears to be considerable flexibility regarding their
use, some speakers using them more than others in comparable texts.
Repetition and setting information may also mark new sub-topics. A
particle is not used to introduce a narrative. The particles all occur in the
clause-initial position followed by a pause. The particles are: hari 'then',
which in other contexts may be a verb root with an auxiliary verb
following, meaning 'finish, enough, goodby', and oniaro and oniani, which in
other contexts are the subject emphasis pronouns.

marks progression in the narrative, oniaroa may occur alone (782, 783) or

"The feminine agreement on the thematic verb suffix -hi agrees with the
number and gender of the omitted object, that is, 'palm tree'. This is
unambiguous, since the text was about getting palm fruit. The prefix bi'3SG' shows that the subject is third person. There were two possibilities in
the text-a man, Paulo, or a woman, Ka'ajo. An intransitive verb marked
for feminine gender by the thematic suffix occurs in the immediate context,
also with an omitted subject. Both clauses refer to the same referent, so
the bi- in the example given must refer to Ka'ajo.

While (286) is semantically a manner clause, it would be more accurate to
describe it syntactically as a demoted object (i.e., complement) clause than
an adverbial clause. The main verb meaning 'teach* is ditransitive and in
these constructions the recipient or beneficiary is always the direct object,
marked by the enclitic -ra OBJ', with the patient being the demoted object
marked either by -a OBL' or (as in 286) by a demonstrative. (See section
1.3 for discussion of ditransitive clauses.)
There is one other more complex type of adverbial clause with which the
hi construction functions as the main clause. This is an equative clause in
which the predicate nominal is expressed by means of a dependent verb
form. In this construction the whole equative clause is functioning as an
adverbial. (For other functions of equative clauses in complex sentences»
see 14.2 and 14.6). The equative clause always precedes the hi construction.
It consists of a predicate nominal, the copula mani and a demonstrative.
The predicate nominal may consist only of the dependent verb (288) or it
may also have a subject (289, 290) or object (291) nominal grammatically
related to that verb. The nominal always precedes the verb and, when the
verb is transitive, is marked by the appropriate enclitic, -a 'ERG1 (290) or
-ra OBJ' (291), The semantic functions expressed are either reason
(288-291) or purpose (292, 293).

DEM:LOCExample (485) is one way of expressing (semantic) subordination, i.e., by
means of juxtaposition of two main clauses, the first of which is
semantically subordinate to the other. For other, morphologically marked
ways of expressing subordination (e.g., suffixes and particles), see section
14, These include a number of different types of temporal subordinate
clauses that express relative time periods within a discourse.
18.2 Aspect There are overt forms for expressing the following aspects:
completive (or perfective), continuous, iterative and durative. Ingressive and
terminative meanings can be optionally expressed by using a regular verb.
The completive aspect suffix -'il-'a may occur before any thematic suffix
or dependent suffix (-7 precedes -ki, -a, -nil-na and -hi\ -'a occurs
elsewhere). In a dialogue, -'il-'a marks completive/perfective aspect.
