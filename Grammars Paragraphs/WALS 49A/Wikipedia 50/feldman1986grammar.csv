-wo/-aThis analysis assumes that functions are to be assigned to forms - the formal
case markers del imit the cases and each case has one or more syntactic or
semantic function s .
Whitehead ( 198 1 ) has developed a typology for case marking in Papuan languages
based on the distribution of case markers in nouns and pronouns and the i r
functions in marking Agents (=transitive sub j ects=A (Dixon 197 9 » , Actors (=S) ,
Patients (=0) , Recipients and Bene factive s . Awtuw ' s case marking system , for
both full NPs and pronouns , as well as its pronoun marking , fal ls into his
class l I b , which inc ludes those languages , 19 per cent of his sample of 3 5 ,
that have zero marking on As and Ss and a case marker on Os . Like 13 per cent
of the sample , Awtuw marks Bene factives , Recipients , and Patients in the same
way ( see Fe ldman and Seiler 198 3 ) .",[113]
"The interrogative pronouns take nominal case marking and may replace a nominal
constituent in any role .
( 16 )ye r a n Awt i y - r e d u - p uya - ka ?
who? Awtiy-o FA-hit- PF
who has hit Awtiy ?",[151]
"3 . 5 . 2 Aside from the various case markers to be discussed i n Chapter 6 , Awtuw
substantives accept two adverbi a l suffixe s , -wo just� a lone and -ye again .
These fol low the substantive immediately and precede any case marking , A l l
substantives accept them with apparently equal felicity and they d o n o t exhibit
differences in form when they occur on personal pronouns . But only -wo , in the
form -wa , may be followed by a case marker , and the only case marker that can
follow i t i s the unmarked form of the obj ect suffix - r e o The following examples

ful l in Table 3 . 10 .",[47]
"( 1 ) Fir s t , a s I mentioned above , the subj ect never bears case marking . But the
complementary nouns that co-occur obligatori ly with the idiomatic composite
verbs discussed in 5 . 4 never do so e i the r . Note that in clauses whose sub j ect
is a pronoun , a personal name , or an NP wi th any determiner or modifier , this
problem does not arise because the noun complement of idiomatic complement
constructions i s always a s ingle common noun .
A s imple subs titution test can distinguish the sub j ect in any clause where
there is a doubt as to its identif icat ion . The complementary noun in an
idiomatic composite construction is lexically specified . So if we substitute8788
an appropriate pronoun coreferential with the noun in question , and the clause
remains acceptable , we can be certain that that noun i s the subj ect of the
c laus e , I f such a substitution results in a n unacceptable c l ause , then w e can
identify the noun as a complementary noun .","[93, 94]"
"( 1 ) Although sub j ects never bear case marking, there are other nouns that may
occur in the c lause that never bear case marking e i ther ( c f . 6 . 1 and 5 . 4 ) .
( 2 ) Obj ect marking is obl i gatory on some di rect obj ects and optional on others
(cf. 6 . 2 ) .
( 3 ) Although indirect obj ects always bear obj ect marking , certain direct
obj ects do so too ( c f . 6 . 2 ) .
Furthermore , a lthough Awtuw ' s basic word order is readily identifiable as verb
fina l , indeed as 50V, as order and other permutations are far too common to
allow word order to be of any value in ident ifying grammatical relations .
It is possibl e , nevertheless , to i solate the three relations on the basis of a
more complicated s tatement of their case marking properties in combination with
other criteria . It is important to be able to identi fy grammatical relations
on formal grounds. and without re ference to verb semantics because the
classif icat ion of verbs in section 5 . 2 relies on the ir abi lity to co-occur with
NPs in various grammatical relations .",[93]

1 . The subordinate verb in any nominal construction may optionally bear the
suffix - re o As I wi ll discuss in section 10 . 3 , verbs in adverbial cons tructions
may bear the suffix - re - k . The se two suffixes are homophonous with the obj e ct
and instrumental/comitative case markers , respectively ( see Chapter 6 ) .
While a number o f the constructions di scussed in this section are , in fact ,
direct object complements , it i s interesting that subj ect complement s , although
marginal , may take - re , as shown in section 10 . 2 . 4 . Relative clauses may also
take this suf fix . It would appear therefore that this case marker has been at
least partially reanalysed a s a subo�dination marker . But since - re retains
its obj e ct-marking function in many case s , I wi l l continue to gloss it as such .
There i s no convincing evidence that the Instrumental/Comitative suffix has
undergone a similar reana lysi s .
2 . The embedded predications discussed i n the subsequent sections may , l ike
most constituents of an Awtuw clause , occur clause initially or final ly , a s
we l l a s clause medially . For the most part , I wil l exemplify only the c lause
medial construction , but I will insert il lustrative example s of these
constituents in other positions from time to time .","[162, 163]"

Wurm ( 1 9 7 7 a ) has drawn attention to a remarkable consistency among the diverse
languages of New Guinea in the forms of certain personal pronouns . Examining
the s ingular forms in all three persons and the first and second person plural s ,
h e finds that most of the pronouns marking these categories throughout New
Guinea fall into one of three basic sets and that a given language wi l l often
select most of its pronouns from the same set or in a predictable way from two
or a l l three set s . Because the pronominal forms in a given set crop up over a
geographically large area and in no way restrict themselves to s ingle genetic
groupings , Wurm concludes that personal pronouns are , contrary to popular
opinion , commonly borrowed from language to language .
Awtuw ' s personal pronouns are quite consi stent in their set membership . The
second person plural form bears no resemblance to the pronouns in any of the
sets Wurm has establ i shed . But the other four categories a l l display Set I
feature s .
One of the postulated Set I forms for third person singular i s / te / , which
resembles the corresponding female form in Awtuw quite c losely . There i s a l so
a predictable consonant alternation , character istic of Set I pronouns signal l ing
the gender distinction in the third person s ingular . A property of second
person s i ngular forms in Set l aX appears to end in a coronal consonant and
begin with a /y/ , as does the Awtuw form /ye n / . S imilar l y , Set I first person
forms typica lly contain an / n / , while Set X forms add to this a /wV - / in the
s ingular , and an /-m/ in the plura l , yie lding the Awtuw forms /wa n / and / nom/ .
Personal pronouns have a somewhat different set of morphological properties
from nouns , demonstratives , and interrogatives . With regard to the suff ixes
they may accept , nouns marked for number resemble personal pronouns . In other
respects , however , personal pronouns are unique .
First of a l l , only personal pronouns may bear the Possessive suffix -ke ,
described in 6 . 3 . Second , the Obj ect suffix on personal pronouns has the
canonical form -e , subj ect to vowe l harmony ( cf . 2 . 2 . 1 0 ) , and does not exhibit
the sex gender agreement characteristic of the corresponding suffix on other
substantive lexemes . And third , personal pronouns may never bear the Locative/
Direction suffix -e/ke , described in 6 . 5 .

context. Both have low functional loads and are probably arcane literary

pronouns and nouns marked for numbe r may take possessive , but not loca tive
marking ( see 3 . 6 . 2 ) . Nouns unmarked for numbe r , Demonstratives , Quanti fiers ,
Obl iviative s , and Interrogatives may take locative marking but not possessive
marking . A third person personal pronoun must follow such substantives and
bear pos sess ive marking for them ( see 7 . 6 ) . The pronoun agrees with the
possessor in number and if singular , optiona lly in gender .
This section considers primarily the functions o f the case markers , which I
list here , for convenience , together with thei r al lomorph s . Further discuss ion
of the morphophono logical alternations af fecting these suf fixes is to be found
in section 2 . 2 . 10 , and there is a di scussion of the formal properties of nouns
and pronouns in sections 3 . 5 and 3 . 6 .

the data it is based upon belong to the Awtuw speaking people of Kamlakwlape,
Wutlakwlape , Wiyuplape , Tupumlape, and Kalaktuwlape .
I am most deeply indebted to the people of Meleylape , who allowed me to live in
their hamlet for fifteen months, who helped me in many ways, and who patiently
taught me their language . Among those who were most forthcoming were Yowmen,
Takiy, Poliw, Altiy, Awkay, Awtiy, Eykiy, Kampo, Keriy, Mimpel , Momoy, Naytow,
Osiy, Ruwmay, Wawpey, Yinow, Napeyre, Nimpiy. I am particularly grateful to
Kewmaey, Yawur, Yakop, and Napeyre, who allowed me to tape their narratives and
to Peyaw, Mimpel, and Ruwmay, who dictated stories to me . There is no way that
I can ever repay my debt to Yawur and Yakop, who helped me to transcribe texts
and provided virtually all of the elicited material I have used.
I am also grateful to the Institute of Papua New Guinea Studies, the Department
of Language at the University of Papua New Guinea, the Sandaun Provincial
Government, the Lumi District Office, and Kewmaey, Councillor for the Awtuw­
speaking area, for their permission to study Awtuw.
A large number of people deserve my thanks for the accommodation they so
graciously provided. Wietze Baron accommodated me at Ukarumpa. Paul of the
Lumi Police Detachment, Ian Bagley and other staff at Lumi High School , Father
Terry and others at St Mary' s Catholic Mission, and Kewmaey allowed me to stay
in their houses in Lumi . And Brian McClintock put me up in Port Moresby.
Leo Yimiten and Lumi District Office Staff helped me in a variety of ways and
made the 1980 census data available to me .
Val Lyon of the Department of Geography, Faculty of Arts at the Australian
National University was kind enough to draw the map.
Ger Reesink, Wietze Baron, Ken McElhanon, Les Bruce, and Dave Scorza of the
Summer Institute of Linguistics (PNG Branch) discussed my proposed fieldwork
with me and provided me with access to some unpublished material in their
library.
Don Laycock, Cecil Brown, Bill Mitchell , and Keith Thomas corresponded with me
and encouraged me while I was in the field.
I would also like to thank Avery Andrews , Cliff Goddard, Ian Green, Walter
Seiler, Tim Shopen and David Wilkins for discussing my work with me, and Cliff
and David in particular for their valuable comments on draft chapters .
The Australian National University provided me with a generous scholarship
which made it possible to undertake this project at all .
Finally, my gratitude to Tanya and Adam McConvell for their support and
encouragement is unbounded.

I n addition to the properties they share with number-marked nouns , personal
pronouns have three dis tinctive morphosyntactic characteristics .
Personal pronouns take the suffix - yffin to form what we may call Emotive
pronouns . These are u sed when the speaker wants to e l icit sympathy for the
referent of the suffixed pronoun .e

I n origin , this suffix i s very probably a diminutive . I t is homophonous with
the noun yffin chi ld, which compounds fair ly productively with other nouns to
denote the young of an animal or a sma l l token of the type denoted by the bare
noun .

pronouns . Such forms have two bas i c functions - to emphasise an argument ,
usua l ly in contrastive s i tuations , and to s ignal coreference with the preceding
subj ect . In thi s latter case , emphatic pronouns bear the possess ive suffix
when the possessor i s coreferential with the subj ect , bear the reflexive marker44
' when the direct or indirect obj ect is coreferential with the subj ect , and mark
the subj ect of a succeeding clause , with or without the ref lexive marker , to
mark it unambiguously as coreferential with the preceding subject ( c f . 5 . 1 ,
10 . 6 ) .

"3 . 8 . 1 The suffix - neney i s enormous ly productive and regularly forms
apparently nonce express ions from any e l igible noun , i . e . any common noun .
Its basic meaning would appear to be to attribute the noun bearing the suffix
as a property or posses sion of the noun that the derived adj ective mod i f ie s .
The examples i n ( 3 8 ) illu strate these two meanings .

adj ective classes , many of the gaps in the inventory of basic adj ectival50
meanings are filled not by nouns or verbs ( cf . Schachter to appear p . 1S ) , but
rather by derived adj ectives with - n eney .

the morphological properties of personal pronouns rece ive fuller discussion in

-CHAPTER 4V E RBAL MORPHOSYNTAX4. 1Structure o f the verb compl exMany o f the aff ixes discussed in this chapter have already appeared in section
2 . 2 . There I was concerned with the changes phonemes undergo in the presence
of other spec i fied phonemes and boundaries in the verb complex and elsewhere .
Here , I descr ibe the formal morphological simi larities and differences among
verbs , the co-occurrence of affixes , and the meanings and functions of the
affixe s . I llustrative paradigms are to be found at the end of this chapter .
We can begin by examining a few highly expanded forms of typical verbs to
i l lustrate the overall structure of the verb complex and the order of the
elements that it compr ises . For the sake of intel ligibility , I wi l l f irst
display a table o f the slots i n the verb complex and the affixes that may f i l l
them , and then present the evidence for the analys i s . with the exception o f
slot +1 , the l i s t s o f affixes for each slot are exhaustive . I discuss the
aff ixes that occur in slot +1 fully in section 4 . 1 2 .
Co-occurrence restrictions make three examples neces sary to i l lus trate the
relative order of a f f ixes in all slots . I will discuss these in subsequent
section s .
Example ( 1 ) shows the relative order o f a f f ixes i n s lots -8 , - 7 , - 6 , - 5 , -4 ,

language in its social and sociolinguistic context, Chapter 2 provides an
overview of Awtuw's rich phonological and morphophonological system, Chapter
examines the structure of a few lexical fields of general interest, and Chapter
12 describes some paralinguistic phenomena.
111 . 1 . 3 The aims and methodology of linguistic theory and of linguistic
description are fundamentally different. The aim of theory is to delimit and
explain the functions of language in human society and human cognition. Its
methodology must therefore be to establish a set of explanatory principles that
will generate hypotheses about linguistic functions and the ways that languages
can express them. These hypotheses can then be tested against empirical data
about languages.
The aim of linguistic description is to identify the formal classes, categories ,
and structures of a language on empirical , language-internal evidence. Its
methodology must therefore be to examine and analyse such evidence and to
correlate the formal properties so isolated with their semantic functions.
In other words, it must describe language from the addressee's perspective
decoding forms into meanings, rather than from the speaker's perspective
encoding meanings into forms.
This is not to insist that every identifiable form is necessarily in a one-to­
one correspondence with a single meaning; we often encounter examples of
polysemy or structural ambiguity. But, as a heuristic, we do not expect a
mUltiplicity of forms to correspond to a single semantic category.
1 . 1 . 4 The approach taken in this description is therefore essentially
structuralist. I assume the utility of binary features and relative markedness
in distinguishing categories at all levels of structure. I further assume that
features used in a description should correspond to empirically identifiable
categories. Whenever possible, I have attempted to establish a correspondence
between formal categories and plausible semantic categories .
A feature-based analysis has two advantages . Features often cross-classify
such that a small set of formal/functional properties can distinguish a large
number of categories . It is also possible to make certain kinds of generalis­
ations regarding the properties of marked and unmarked categories.
For example, in the analysis of tense marking in Chapter 4, the feature
NONPRESENT at the same time distinguishes Present forms from Past forms, Future
from Desiderative, and Conditional from Frustrative. It also identifies the
morphologically unmarked Present with the semantically unmarked category of
non-NONPRESENT.
Throughout this description, I have aimed to express significant generalisations
intelligibly. When it seemed to further this aim, have borrowed formalisms
from Generative theory. I do not mean this to imply any credence in the claims
of the theory. The formalisms merely represent a handy and familiar convention
for schematising certain types of generalisations.
When a language is described in accordance with these principles, the hypotheses
generated by theory can be tested against the description. I have attempted
therefore to present an analysis that is empirically-based and relatively
theoretically neutral , and that reflects the structure of the language
faithfully.

between 142°29 ' and 142°3 1 ' East longitude and 3°3 4 ' and 3°3 6 South latitude in
an area of about 30 square kilometres in the southern foothills of the
Torricelli Range in north-western Papua New Guinea (see Map 1 ) . All five
villages are administered as part of the South-west Wapei Census Division of
the Lumi District, Sandaun (West Sepik) Province of Papua New Guinea.
The five Awtuw-speaking villages are located at altitudes ranging from 3 2 0 to
400 metres above sea-level. Rainfall in Kamlakwlape, recorded from May to
December 1980 , ranged from a low of 7 1 . 5mm in June to a high of 2 3 7 . 7mm in
December. Temperatures range from 19 . 4° to 3 2 . 2° Celsius, with an average of
2 2 . 2° at 0600 and 29 . 4° at 1500 daily, with no appreciable seasonal variation.
Table 1.1 lists the five villages with their vernacular names, their names in
Tok Pisin, their populations in 1980 , and the names of the component hamlets.

What i s odd is that when dffin i seems t o b e most determiner-like semantically,
when it signals indefiniteness , it must occur in the Quantifier s lot , where we
would expect it to be less determiner - like . And when i t occurs as a Determine r ,
it has the less determiner- like meaning . I t may be possible t o explain this in
terms of dffin i ' s prede liction to mean precisely one , in thi s pos ition . Dffin i
substitutes for the numeral n a ydowo one in many contex t s . I ndeed , naydowdowo
only one, alone appears to occur much more frequently than the bare nume ral ,
probably because dffin i is the unmarked form for one .
Once we have established that dffin i as a Quantifier is very much l ike the
numeral one , it requires no great leap to see how it has come to mean a , as
the numeral one has in many other language s .
For example , i n Tongan , despite a three-way di stinction o f re ferentiality - the
artic le ha ' non - referential ' contrasting with the article e/he ' referentia l '
which in turn contrasts with the article e/he with an accompanying shift in
stress to the last vowe l in the NP ' definite ' - the commonest way o f marking an
NP as non-referential is to use a construction with the numeral .

Three type s of lexemes may take Possessive marking . Any noun with the plural
suffix -m may take Possess ive marking . Forms with the dua l , plural , and generic
suffixe s also accept the Possessive su ffix . And all Personal Pronouns are
eligible to take - ke .
Nouns unmarked for number , including Proper and Place names , demons trative s and
interrogatives are followed by the possess ive form of a third person personal
pronoun . The pronoun carrying possessive marking agrees in number and gender
with the referent of the NP in accordance with the principles discussed above .

The rules are ordered and must apply sequentially . This i s particularly
important in the case of the vowel harmony ru les that affect the qual ity of the
Imperfective and Past suffixes ( 2 . 2 . 7 and 2 . 2 . 1 0) . Although nearly identical
in form, one must apply before , and the other after , the e l i sion rule ( 2 . 2 . 9 ) .
with the exception of the vowel gradation rule ( 2 . 2 . 2 0 ) , I have used the
traditional forma l i sms of Generative Phonology to capture the rules conc i sely .
But as I mentioned in Sect ion 1 . 1 . 4 , I do not mean to imply any credence in the
claims of the theory . The formalism mere ly represents a convention to
schematise morphophonological rule s .
Among the formal i sms I have adopted is the labe lled angle bracket notation
(Chomsky and Halle 1 968 : 394-395) . This convention , suggested to me by Avery
Andrews , permits parts of the environment for a rule to be keyed to the
presence or absence of a feature . The benefit of this forma l i sm is that a
single process with a complex environment can be represented as a single ru le ,
in conformity with the intuitive j udgement that the process is unitary in spite
of the complexity of its environment .
Features enclosed in label l ed angle brackets are interpreted as relevant parts
of the environment if the label is [+J, and are ignored when the label is [-J.
Greek letter values are multiplied by any operator on them . Thus , an angle
bracket labe l led [aJ has the same value as some f eature specified [aJ. But an
angle bracket label led [-aJ has the oppos i te value from the f eature spec ified
as [aJ. In example ( 2a ) , the feature F2 is a re levant part of the environment
when Fl is spec ified as [ + J , and irre levant when Fl is speci f ied as [-J. In
example ( 2b) , F2 is relevant when Fl is [-J, and irrelevant when Fl is [+J .
(2)(a)[aFIJ
[ +F2 J><ex(b)[aFIJ
[ +F2 J><-exThus , the environment in ( 2a) wi l l be read as either [ -FI J , or [ +F l , +F 2 J , and
( 2b) will be read as e ither [ +FI J , or [ -Fl , +F2 J .
I present each rule in a separate subsection , so references to , e . g . Rule 3 ,
refer to the rule presented i n subsection 2 . 2 . 3 . Note that this type of
analysis produces intermediate forms that are neither phonemic nor phonetic
( c f . Chomsky and Halle 1968 : 65 ) . I enclose all non-phonemic forms in square
brackets ([ . . . J) .","[22, 23]"

Locative marking,
(c) Interrogative Pronouns like y e ra n , which neither distinguish number nor

Direct Objects and it was for thi s reason that I recognised the category in 5 . 1 .

The l a s t point I want t o make here with regard t o the Pronouns is the function
of the third person Personal Pronouns . These are by far the most common
determiners in any di scourse . Their function is to mark an NP as definite ,
which accounts for the i r ubiquitousnes s . While definite NPs need not be
dete rmined by such a pronoun , all NPs determined by rev , tey , rrew , or rom are
de finite .","[127, 128, 129, 130]"
"30The other class, whose members accept the suffix as shown in examples (4c-d) ,
share the semantic property of constantly referring to tokens of the same type,
or CONSTANT REFERENCE, and I will accordingly denominate them Common Nouns .
A further feature, the ability to accept the Dual suffix, -wrew , serves to
divide each of these classes in two.
(a) '� Kam 1 akw-wrew

*two womenExample ( 5 ) illustrates the distinction among proper nouns. The proper nouns
that accept the suffix share the semantic property of referring uniquely to a
person, while those that do not refer to places and I accordingly denominate
them Personal Names and Place Names respectively.
Common nouns that accept
share the semantic property of referring to
relatives and are called Kinship Terms. Example (6c) shows that the distinction
is not between human and non-human common nouns or between animate and inanimate
common nouns. While in most respects syntactically identical to other common
nouns, it will become apparent in Chapter 7 that kinship terms need to be
distinguished from the other common nouns here. section 3 . 5 presents a
description of the other formal properties of nouns .
Table 3 . 2 displays the feature specifications for each of the subdivisions in
this class and Figure 3 . 2 illustrates the structure of the classification.

those that may not follow tade r this to form a single constituent. These
lexemes share the semantic property of referring to tokens of different types,
or SHIFTING REFERENCE. In accordance with the usual convention, I call them
Pronouns .
Two additional features divide the pronouns into four distinct classes.

while others do not.

- e / - o / - a after consonants .
The vowel quality of the suffix is determined by a
vowe l harmony rule described in 2 . 2 . 10 . I t occurs on NPs re ferring to places ,
inc luding Demonstratives , but never on personal pronouns . I t may occur o n an
adj ective or an intens i fier if it is the last word in such a noun phrase , as in
( 3 3d) and ( 3 3 e ) .

kapem wa r u k e - kepond bigL
to/from/at a big pondThe Location/Direction suffix marks the source or the goal of motion , i f it is
a place , . i . e . a place name , a direction , or denotes some physical locality ,
e . g . a house , a road, a river, a part of a house o r a tree , etc . It also marks
the location of a state , process , or action , again provided that the NP refers
to a place . The meaning of the as sociated verb determines the interpretation
of Locative NP as e i ther location or direction , and if direction , whether
from or to . Thus , unless the clause contains a Direction verb , the Locative NP
wil l refer to a location . I f the clause contains the verb �y go , one of the
other Goal verbs ( c f . 5 . 2 ) or a seriali sation with �y , then the Locative NP
wil l refer to a goal . And i f the clause contains the verb �y� come , one of the
other Source verbs ( c f . 5 . 2 ) , or a seriali sation ending in �y� , then the
Locative will be a source . There are a number of ' location ' nouns that commonly
compound with other nouns to make the reference of the Locative more explicit
( c f . 3 . 7 . 2 ) . The fol lowing list includes all such nouns that have come to my
attention .","[119, 120]"
"7 . 3 . 3 Quantifiers are more constrained than Pronouns in the range of Nomina ls
they may determine . A Quantifier may not determine any Nominal that is other­
wise quanti fied in any way , either by a Quanti fier in the Quanti fier constituent
or by number marking on the Noun . Furthermore , a Quantifier may not determine
any Proper Noun or S . Quantifiers may only determine otherwise unquanti fied
Common nouns .

that the referent of that NP is not the most sa lient instance of the type that

"5 . 1 . 3 In summary , then , I define the three identifiable grammatical relations
as follows :
( 1 ) The subj ect is that NP that never takes obj ect marking , even when
pronominal , that triggers person and number agreement on the verb , that is the
obligatory antecedent of an emphatic pronoun , and that may occur as the direct
obj ec t of the matrix clause in di rect perception constructions .
( 2 ) The direct object i s the NP that takes optional object marking when i t i s
a common noun and when i t s referent is lower in empathy than , o r less l ikely to
have performed the action than , the subj ect .",[96]

( 2 ) Second , only the subj ect of the clause can trigger person agreement in
those verb forms - Hortative , Imperative , and Debitive - that are marked for
person . As first- and second-person subj ects , where overt , are always
pronominal , and therefore readily identifiable as subjects by the ir lack of
case markin g , I will i l lustrate with the third person form .

*the children must hi t the two women4 . Fourth, Awtuw refers to an antecedent through a variety of ava i lable
strategies . Among these are zero anaphora , an ordinary personal pronoun , an
emphatic pronoun , or an emphatic pronoun in combination with a reflexive
marker . Where the pragmatics of the verb of a second c lause are such that the
sub j ect of the preceding clau se is at least as l ikely to have performed the
action depicted in the second verb as the obj ect , then it w i l l be interpreted
as the antecedent for any of these strategies .",[94]

thoseTo begin with the pronouns , we notice immediately that there are two
demonstrative roots , ( t ) a de and ( t ) opo , each of which codes a category of
proximity , within reach and out of reach respectively . The se are then marked
for plurality with the suffix -m . Non-plural forms further distingui sh female
from non-female referents . The optional t- in the pronouns and the manner
adverb does not appear to correlate with any grammatical category and forms
with and without the t- are in free variation . The eight manner adverb forms
also seem to be in free variation .
We may conveniently compress the demonstrative adverb forms into the fol lowing
constructs .

formal s imi larities that suggest that they ought to be treated together . There
are three basic interrogative adverbs and two pronouns , but the use of the
derivational suffix - kwo allows Awtuw to express a full range of WH- questions

A more complex embe llishment of the Ascriptive predication has the unusual
feature of the posse ssor of the body part appearing as an Obj e ct . As example
( 7 ) shows , such constructions may also have peripheral NP s , in this case , a

we two were cold in the piverA semantically similar type of predication has the posse s sor of the body part
unmarked for case . This makes ana lysis ambiguous . We could analyse the
unmarked possessor as the subject and the noun and adj ective as constituents of
a single NP in a classificatory predication (cf . 8 . 4 . 1 ) . But I bel ieve that it
i s pre ferable to analyse the adjective alone as an ascriptive predicate whose
sub j ect is the body part . This leaves the syntactic function of the unmarked
possessor in some doubt , but unmarked posse ssors are common in constructions
with �� ��y ( c f . 5 . 10 ) . Moreove r , the structural and semantic para lle l between137
thi s construction and those exemplif ied in ( 6 ) and ( 7 ) i s too strong to ignore .
The semantic parallel with a classificatory predicate , on the other hand , is

verb may be the first in such a compound , the second and subsequent roots are

of this set may themselves function as independent verb roots in meanings
reasonably closely re lated to the meanings they express in a compound . The
balance bear no phono logical resemblance to any independent verb root , although
they al l have a phonologica l shape that would be plausible for one .

But we will need to apply another substitution test to identify pronominal and
personal name direct obj ects in clauses wi th common noun subj ects , in other words ,
where the direct ob j ect is higher in empathy than the subj ect . In such clauses ,
pronominal and personal name direct obj ects take obligatory object marking and
are therefore indi stinguishable from indirect obj ects on formal grounds wi thout
reference to information about the meaning of the verb . We cannot substi tute a
human common noun , because it will nece s sarily be equal to or higher than the

substitute a non-human common noun for the pronoun or personal name in que s tion .
If the substituted common noun s t i l l requires ob ject marking , then it must be
an indirect obj ect . If the clause is acceptable whether the substituted common

3. 1Approach to parts -of- s peech a na l ys i sIn accordance with the descriptive strategy adopted throughout this grammar,
this section will endeavour to segregate on language-internal morpho syntactic
grounds discrete classes of lexemes in Awtuw, to identify subclasses of the
classes so segregated, and to relate the classes thus isolated to universal
semantic categories.
The most revealing way to view a part-of-speech system
is as a few large stem classes . . . divided into
successively smaller classes on the basis of additional
criteria. (Hockett 1958 : 2 2 1 - 2 2 8 )
Following Hockett, we can impose a structure on our analysis of the Awtuw
parts-of-speech system by dividing Awtuw lexemes into broad classes and
refining these into more restricted classes corresponding to the parts of
speech in Awtuw.
I refine Hockett ' s method by treating each identifying property as a privative
feature , which can segregate two classes according to the presence or absence
of the feature (Trubetzkoy 1969 : 7 4 ) . The presence of a feature characterises
the marked category.
The structure of a parts-of-speech system thus takes on the shape of a
bifurcating tree each of whose branchings represents the segregation of two
classes based on the specification for a given feature. When no additional
formal properties serve to segregate pairs of categories, the branch terminates
in a named class. In some cases it is possible to name superordinate classes .
Figure 3 . a exemplifies the structure.

To clarify the feature specification, I have included a matrix with each tree.
Once a class had been isolated at any level of structure, specification for
features associated with other classes becomes irrelevant to its classification.
Therefore, not all features used in this analysis cross-classify. For example,
referring to Figure 3.a, the specification of Named Class 3 for feature B is
irrelevant to its classification, and will therefore be enclosed in parentheses
in the associated matrix, Table 3 . a.

(+)-While it is assumed here that the assignment of words to
parts-of-speech classes is based on properties that are
grammatical rather than semantic, and often language­
particular rather than universal, it is also assumed that
the name that is chosen for a particular parts-of-speech
class in a language may appropriately reflect universal
semantic considerations . (Schachter, 1985 : 2 ,
cf. Lyons 1968:147 , 317-319)
I will therefore refrain from assigning names to the classes isolated in this
analysis until they have been refined sufficiently to suggest a correlation
with a universal semantic type (cf. Dixon 1977 :19-20, 24-30, Lyons ' 1 966: 214) .
The diagnostic properties used to segregate the parts-of-speech classes here
will identify all members of any class , including derived forms. But in
assigning names to classes, it is necessary to identify a focal subclass whose
members are necessarily monomorphemic.
3.2Maj o r c l a s se sFirst we can segregate those lexemes that accept the Perfect aspect suffix - kay
from those that do not and denominate the segregated class Class I .
Next, we can divide those lexemes that cannot bear aspect marking into two
additional classes. We call those that can occur as the unique constituent of
a noun phrase Class II �nd the residuum that cannot, Class III .
It may clarify this tripartite division to represent the identifying criteria
by binary features and display the specifications for each class on a matrix.
(Values for features that are irrelevant to the classification are enclosed in
parentheses) .","[29, 30, 31, 32, 33]"

Forms on this branch distingui sh Nonfactivity as marked in slot - 7 . A lthough
the Nonfactive prefix w- and the Factive prefix d- both make more than one
tense di stinction , it is preferable to identify Nonfactive as the marked form
for the purpose of this analy s i s .
S ince non-Debitive , non-Potential forms make precisely the same distinctions
regardless of their spec i f i cation for Negativity , further d i scussion w i l l be
neutral with respect to Negativity .
Nonfactive and non-Nonfactive forms distinguish tense through the feature
Nonpresent . Nonfactive forms spec i fied Nonpresent bear the Future suffix
and those specif ied non-Nonpresent bear the Desiderative suff ix . Non-Nonfactive
forms specif ied Nonpresent have past tense mark i ng , whi le those speci fied
non-Nonpresent are unmarked for tense .
This feature Conditional dist ingui shes forms with the Conditional suffix in
slot +4 from those that lack it. Condi tional forms are redundantly speci f ied
as Nonfactive . Thus non-Nonfactive forms wil l automatically be specif ied as
non-Conditional , while Nonfactive forms distingui sh Conditional and non­
Conditiona l .
Thi s analys i s conveniently specifies Conditional forms , which occur i n past
contrafactual condition s , as Nonfactive , Nonpresent , and Conditional , and
Frustratives , which depict frustrated de s i re s , as Nonfactive , non-Nonpresen t ,
and Conditional . Note that the only marker from s lot +5 that may co-occur with
the Conditional suf f ix i s the Desiderative suff ix .
I t is now appropriate to d i splay another diagram to c larify the feature
specif ications made thus far and the i r correspondence with verb suffixes .

Potential forms require Nonfactive marking and may bear either the Future
or the Conditional suffix. Redundancy rule 1 yields all possible forms under
this node.

Note that Potential forms must also be non-Debitive and non-Negative , but
because all three categories, potential, Debitive, and Negative are expressed
by affixes in the same slot, the redundancy rule need not specify it.
Potential forms may still be specified for Conditionality. Potential
Conditionals take the Conditional suffix and Potential non-Conditionals take
the Future suffix, as was the case with non-Potential forms specified as
Nonfactive and Nonpresent.
-+4.7.6Two additional redundancy rules will specify the mood and tense values
for Debitive forms. The first of these stipulates that Negative Debitives will
also be Nonfactive and Nonpresent, and so have Future marking, and
non-Negative Debitives will be neither.

and that non-Perfect forms that

non-Nonpresent must be specified are
as
Imperfective. In other words , forms with
any Debitive or tense marking may bear
either Perfect or Imperfective marking,
or be unmarked for aspect, while non-Debitive
forms unmarked for tense must
bear either the Perfect or the Imperfective suffix.","[68, 69, 70]"
