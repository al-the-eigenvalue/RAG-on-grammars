"The semanticrelationship of the verb to the noun, differs from case to
case.",[575]
"The two clearest cases are names ofTheword for 'hummingbird' is/memlew/ for mostinformants, but IE used the form /memlewhu/.",[496]

10.2.",[460]
"Such a formalso occurs occasionally in texts in cases where the word
that is the possessor of the noun has been previously
mentioned but does not immediately precede this prefix.
In this case the prefix might be said to have anaphoric
reference to this preceding word.",[448]
Further expansions in both cases may expressthe subject of the verb.,[473]
"In this case the Optative morpheme would haveallomorphs —h and —9, and the Impel* feet morpheme would have
allomorphs -i and -y.",[383]
"Ineach of these cases the group is isolated from other individ­
uals of like kind.",[552]
"This meansthat in the case of transitive verbs the subjects of the
underlying and the derived stems would be the same, but in
the case of intransitive verbs the subjects would be different,
that of the underlying stem being the inanimate object, but
that of the derived stem being the person.",[565]
"Some of these underlyingnouns are derived from verbs with <d-> Nominal, apparently
for purely formal reasons in the case of vowel-initial stems.
In this case the derived form has the same semantic relation­
ship to the underlying verb as it does without this inter­
vening layer of derivation.",[502]
"In this latter case a morphophonemie change is avoided by
the preferred analysis, as well as by the other alternative,
which would give us / 9 umma*s/.
1.7.10.",[96]
In this case this prefix acts muchlike an intransitive instrumental prefix.,[544]
The derived verbs in the former case express theoccurrence of the natural phenomena.,[571]
"Which of theseallomorphs occurs after the other AuxiliaryVerb Formative, g-, cannot be ascertained, since the result
would be the same in any case.",[393]
"All members of this class begin with aconsonant in at least some allomorphs, and in most cases in
all allomorphs.",[409]
"In this case the indica­tion of inclusiveness is added as a sort of afterthought,
while the number of possessors is redundantly expressed by
the suffix on the pronoun and by the Inclusive suffix.

"The derivationalprefix be- Indefinite Object is added to transitive and
intransitive verb stems, forming intransitive verb stems

"No morpheme belongs toThese classes contain derivedmembers in addition to the primary members, but the patterns
of derivation are very restricted in the case of restricted
noun stems and possessed nouns.",[409]
"In most cases the inserted vowelis /i/, but it is /o/ when the stressed syllable has 0uaB and
/u/ when the stressed syllable has either OnQ or OuiQ.

"The Reference Switchingsuffix -s occurs after finite verbs and sentence connectives
formed with <-a9> -a Aorist or -i Imperfect, and in the case
of the latter, does not inhibit further nominalizatj.cn or
adverbialization of the verb.",[683]
"This means that therule for vowel harmony must be amplified to state that QiQ
conditions /e/ except when preceded by BaQ> in which case it
conditions /a/.",[319]
"This type ofrule is sometimes referred to in what follows as ""insertion"".
Conversely, /$/ may be the phonemic representation of a con­
sonant, as in 3.6, or of a vowel, as in 3.15; this latter
case is sometimes called ""loss"".",[274]
"The commonly occurring Static prefixis addedto both intransitive and transitive verb stems,the resultant forms being intransitive verb stems in either
case.",[558]
"After this heading may come a symbolfor the distribution class, in the case of members of large

in the case of the former, when initial in the word.
4.15.",[368]
"This is basically similarto the pattern of section (1), in that in both cases it is
the consonant beginning the final syllable that is the con­
ditioning factor.",[345]
"However, the analysis that has been adoptedin this grammar sets up .unitary phonemes for two of these,
/z/ and /c/» and considers /ts/ to be a cluster of two
phonemes.
The case of /c/ and /z/ is probably the more straight­
forward.",[81]
"There are three different situa­tions in which a morphophonemic choice between /a/ and /e/
according to patterns of vowel harmony is made in a syllable
preceding the stressed syllable of the word, and the rules
for the choice are the same in each case.",[318]
"A zero is usually writtenon the morphophonemic level only when it is the complete
representation of a morpheme; the recurrent case in what
follows is the allomorph 0,0— B of the Third Person prefix
<’-> .",[274]
"This would not work, however, in the case of the twostems wherein the vowel is followed by a glcttalized stop,
as there is no parallel morphophonemic rule applying to such
an environment.",[396]
"This suffixmay occur twice in succession, in which case the form has
the meaning of a strong affirmation or the contradiction of
a negative assertion.

"The contrast between theThird Person Subjective and Objective pronouns is equivalent
to that obtaining between subjective and objective nouns
(7, 31*1-2 ), and these constitute the only instances in
the language of stems restricted to use as subject or object.
The two Third Person pronouns, aside from the Subjective/
Objective opposition, have a meaning much like that of the
demonstratives, but without the latter*s contrasts of person
or distance.",[460]
"One would not want tosay merely that we have here a portmanteau representation
of the two morphemes, because of the identity of the first
consonant of the Dual Inclusive suffixof the sequence/se/; a more tenable statement would be that this is a case
of including and included morphs, where the /§/ belongs
only to the Dual Inclusive suffix, but the /e/ belongs to
both morphemes.",[382]
"The rather infrequentlyoccurring suffix —emel9 Traditional seems to indicate that
the action expressed by the verb to which it is suffixed is
one that is or was done in accordance with traditional usage,
or, in the case of animals, in accordance with the natural
habits of the species.",[643]
"Some uncertainty of this nature was felt inthe case of the last two stems shown in the prededing section.
However, both the stems seem to be attested as dependent verb
stems, although the prefix, d12— , is not securely identified.",[555]
"As is the case with -gab DistantFuture, there is a strong tendency for a predication bearing
this suffix followed by -i Imperfect to also take a nominalizing suffix following these, with or without intervening

"The one derived verb that seems to occur freelywithout <kM-> gum-, gam- is Qbu.geye a9y[) Vt 'to talk to'.
In the case of some verbs expressing strong interaction, such
as Qgum bu.geweB Vi 'to gamble', the idea of ""togetherness""
seems to take precedence over the idea of duality, so that
forms of the verb may refer to actions of a group of more
than two persons.

"Theanalysis of [ts] as a unitary phoneme / c/ would also not con­

even be more in line with these patterns in the case of the

"With the exception of theCausative stiffix in some cases, it is impossible to determine
the relative order of addition of these stem-formative suf­
fixes and the prefixes that derive independent verb stems
from other independent verb stems (22).",[578]
"In most cases the stemdenotes an action, such as eating, sleeping, swimming, or
shining, which is discontinued after a short time, but in
several instances the reference is to the condition result­
ing from an action, which is nullified relatively quick1y
by a counter-action.",[589]
"In the case ofintransitive and transitive verb stems derived from dependent
verb stems with instrumental prefixes, the Plural affix is
thought to be added subsequently to the instrumental prefix,
