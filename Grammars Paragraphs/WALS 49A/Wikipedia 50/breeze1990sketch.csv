an object, a possessive pronoun,and as the pronoun used in adverbial cases.
There are three forms of subject pronoun:
The normal subject form functions as head of a noun phrase and generally
encodes known information and refers to a subject pervious1y mentioned, e.g.es3 3 3 4 4 .43 2 3

§3.l.6. CO-ORDINATION OF NOUN PHRASES:
There are two types of co-ordinate noun phrase:1.
Where the heads of the noun phrases have equal status, the coordinate marker-a4replaces the case marker on each of them and where the phrase issubject, the following verb will have the plural form.","[43, 44]"
"The clausespreceding the one bearing the case marker bear the noun phrase marker -a
e.g.",[47]
"In fast speech, it may be elided before the determiner.house-Loa be-Detthe man who is in the housemanWhere two nouns are in apposition, the first one bears the NP marker and the
second bears the case suffix, e.g.my sheep, Bokas
1 Pos sheep-NPMK Bokas-S
that old antelope
man-NPMK antelopeold-Det-O§3.l.4. FOCUS WITHIN THE NOUN PHRASE:
When a previously referred to head of a noun phrase has special
prominence in the sentence, an appropriate form of the pronoun may occur
following the determiner, or, in some cases, instead of it.",[42]
"THE NOUN PHRASE MARKER:In a noun phrase, any element other than a pronoun which precedes the
2element bearing the case suffix bears the marker -a ; see the above examples.
This marker, however, does not occur in a phrase where the head is a nonspecific noun, neither is it added to a relative clause which precedes the
head it modifies.",[42]
The case system40§ 3.1.3.,[4]
In all the other cases the suffix is obligatory.,[41]
"Also one element of the clause isreplaced by a question word bearing an appropriate case suffix, e.g.",[58]
"SYNTAX:§3.1. THE NOUN PHRASE:
§3.1.1. NOUN PHRASE STRUCTURE:
The normal structure of the noun phrase can be represented by the
following formula:
NP = (Modifier1) Head (Modifier 2)
Modifier(Determiner)(Case)(Quantifier)can be a possessive pronoun, a numeral, an adjective or a1relative clause.",[39]
"When the head of the phrase is a pronoun, however,the subject almost always bears the nominative suffix, whereas the object
only bears the accusative suffix when it is especially prominent in the
sentence.",[41]
"In 3rdbefore thenasal is added, e.g.ta4m3.5Y1 snto me
3to himWhen the head of the noun phrase is a noun, nominative and accusative
suffixes are obligatory when the noun is specific and optional when the41noun is not specific.","[40, 41]"

No more-than two optional elements other than the case marker have

"However,tone is important in distinguishing the cases of certain pronouns, certain
verb tenses, the morphological classes of certain words and the semantic
features of certain adjectives.
In this paper, the superscript tone numbers are marked following
each syllable.§l.4. THE SYLLABLE:
In Gimira, a syllable may be defined as a tone carrying unit and its
nucleus can either be a vowel or a syllabic nasal.
The structure of syllables with a vowel as nucleus can be shown by
the following formula;-3 3(C) V (CO)+ tone. v5trueExamples;-wood, treeancyapsttime2-3be foundInitial C can be any consonant except jrj,III 1 jsl, lej and /'G,/.",[8]
