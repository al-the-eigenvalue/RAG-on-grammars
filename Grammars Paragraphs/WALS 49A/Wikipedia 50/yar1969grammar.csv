person singular, which is not always the case with the direct (v. above).
In Takestani, jave is also used besides jd(v) for the masculine (an influence of the
nominal oblique form? Cf. Sag.jem-e, etc. v. §§ 240, n.L; 248, n.).
In Xiaraji indi (m.)/india (f.) ‘this’ are also frequently used as personal pronouns. In
the Resala, 61, undi and undiun are given for the 3rd person singular and plural,
respectively. The two forms are given by A. A., 170-171, as possessive and accusative
pronouns, but they are not attested in his texts.
a and aha given by A. A., 171, as 3rd person singular and plural accusative pronouns
are, in fact, direct case pronouns. As a demonstrative adjective, however, a is used also
in the oblique function.
In Ebrahim-abadi, whereas the demonstrative pronouns jijjia (m., f.) ‘that’, jime/jima
(m., f.) ‘this’ are employed for the animate, ana ‘that’ and mana ‘this’, which do not
show gender, are used for the inanimate (v. §§ 338-39).

"96MORPHOLOGYE. USE OF THE NOMINAL CASES1. General Remarks
149. a) Variations in the function of the cases, both within a dialect and
among the dialects, may generally be ascribed to the weakening use of
the oblique case and the increasing function of the direct. This is best
illustrated by the treatment of the agent in the passive construction (v. §
331 IT.) and of the object of a verb (v. § 154 flf.).
b) In the singular, nouns denoting human beings are more conservative
in the retention of the oblique case endings, nouns denoting animals less
conservative in this respect, and nouns denoting inanimate objects least
conservative.
c) With the object of a verb, the use of the singular oblique case
generally serves to define the object (v. § 90).
d) Except in Eshtehardi, the logical direct object in a passive con¬
struction is generally treated as a direct object in a non-passive con¬
struction, because of the weakening of that construction.
150. The direct case is employed for the following:
a)the subject (v. § 151)b)the vocative (v. § 152)c)the agent in most of the dialects (v. § 153)d)some verb objects (v. § 154ff.)e)the object of some postpositions (v. § 159)The oblique case is employed for the following:
a)the genitive (v. § 160)b)the agent in a number of dialects (v. § 153)c)some verb objects (v. § 154 flf.)d)the object of some postpositions (v. § 159)2. The Subject
151. The subject is expressed in the direct case45 in all the dialects.
Examples:
Cha.","[97, 98]"
"149ama pevl-emen unda Ali ‘we gave money to Ali’
dhen pevl-esen unda ‘they gave money’Esf.
az nidiama ‘I have not seen [it]’
c) as logical object,
Esh.az-es berestaym ‘he sent me (literally, I am sent by him)’216. In a few instances in Eshtehardi, it seems that the feminine mor¬
pheme is detached from the verb and attached to the 1st and 2nd person
singular pronoun, creating a feminine-like form for them, e.g.
Esh.az bieyma / aza bieym ‘I (f.) was’
az nieym / aza niem, a yi ‘1 (f.) am not, she is’
to bieysa / toa bieys ‘thou (f.) art’However, aza and toa are impossible, according to Sadeqi, in cases like:
az hama-ruza mivazem(a) ‘I run every day’,
since the gender is not marked in the present. Therefore, perhaps such
forms should be attributed to the loosening of the feminine morpheme
rather than to a feminine form for the 1st and 2nd person singular pro¬
noun. Cf. §§ 275-6, e, fn.; 277, a, fn.; 278, a, fn.
2. Oblique Personal Pronouns217. Oblique personal pronouns, basically collocations of prepositions
and oblique forms of the personal pronouns, are used also as possessive
pronouns and adjectives.3 They function as the genitive, as the direct,
indirect, and postpositional object, and in Eshtehardi also as the agent
in a passive construction. Chali has a separate set of agential pronouns
(see below).
The oblique-possessive personal pronouns are:

"POST- AND PREPOSITIONS123Considering i. and ii. and the general absence of genuine prepositions in
Chali, plus the fact that -u does follow the accusative object in some
examples when no dative object is required (v. above, d), one might
tentatively set up the following rule: in a number of cases u may be used
as a postposition for a non-human accusative object when a dative ob¬
ject of the same verb follows.20
181. -(e)ndu This postposition is primarily used in the instrumental
sense, but also occasionally in the meaning of ‘together with’ and ‘in’
(a meaning primarily expressed with the postposition u).
It occurs as -endu after a consonant, -ondu with words ending in -a or
-d, and -ndu after -i or -u. Examples:
Cha.","[124, 125]"
"B. GENERAL FEATURES OF THE DIALECTSThe most characteristic features of Southern Tati dialects may be sum¬
marized as follows:
1. The distinction of feminine gender in nouns (v. § 92 ff.), pronouns
(v. § 213 If.), and verbs (v. § 269 ff.).
2. The retention of an oblique case in nouns and pronouns (v. §§ 99,
104, 105 ff.).
3. The preservation and extension of an oblique case in -r (v. §§ 100,
104 ff.).
4. The absence of the ezafa construction as a genuine form (but v.
§ 147), and the use of the antecedent genitive or adjective instead (§ 204).
5. The frequent use of postpositions as against prepositions (§175 ff.).
6. The use of the same pronouns as possessive and oblique pronouns
(v. §§213, 217).20
7. The use of the passive construction with past transitive verbs and the
consequent difference in the conjugation of transitive and intransitive
verbs (v. § 331 ff.).
8. The retention of an old mode of the passive formation in verbs
(v. § 341).
To these features is to be added the tendency among the dialects to
treat the animate and the inanimate differently in a number of cases. For
instance, Chali and Xiaraji use the postposition ku ‘in, from for the ani¬
mate, but u for the inanimate (§§ 175, 176, 179, 180, 192); Ebrahim-abadi
employs different demonstrative pronouns for persons and things: jime/
jima ‘this’ (masc. & fern.) and ji/jia ‘that’ (masc. & fern.) for persons, but
mana ‘this’, ana ‘that’ (without distinction of gender) for things (§ 238);
Sagz-abadi makes the distinction of gender in demonstrative pronouns
19
20Cf. A.A., p. 17.
Chali, however, has preserved a set of ‘agential’ pronouns (v. § 218).",[23]
"160 The genitive, which precedes the noun it modifies, is generally ex¬
pressed in all the dialects in the oblique case, e.g.
61a is a shortened form of ra, which here follows the suffix pronoun -(e)s\ v. § 182.",[104]
"Hasan-e (A) beza-s (B-A) bevast (B) ‘Hasan hit [and] ran
off’Only Chali has preserved a set of agential pronouns (v. 218). In Ebrahimabadi the agent appears in the oblique case mostly in the speech of the
older generation. A plural agent, however, is generally put in the direct
case. This is also the case when the agent is a pronoun, e.g.
Ebr.qocen (A) ewa-sen (C-A) axa (B) ‘the rams drank water’
a (A) asb-em (C-A) beza (B) ‘I hit the horse’In the other dialects the agent is generally expressed in the direct case and
the logical direct object treated as the direct object in a non-passive con¬
struction (v. § 158), e.g.
Sag.raha amia-ferar-es (C-A) bedi (B) ‘he saw his cousin on
the way’
ra:yatun-es (C-A) migowast (B) (119) ‘he liked his
farmers’
salvdrun(C) bar-owarde (B) (95) ‘[they] have taken out
[their] trousers’The agent may be a noun or a pronoun. As a pronoun it may be inde¬
pendent or enclitic. When the agent is a noun or an independent pro¬
noun, it is often resumed by a corresponding enclitic pronoun (v. §§ 222224). Examples from Eshtehardi:
a) a noun as the agent,
Esh.",[238]
"74MORPHOLOGYever, in the peripheral Eshtehardi and Takestani) to genitives and direct
objects denoting a person (v. § 134 ff.).
101. All Southern Tati dialects make use of a number of postpositions
which are sometimes hardly distinguishable from case endings, and
create case-like forms (e.g. Cha. u; Tak., Ebr. a; Sag. d ‘in, from’).
Their nature is revealed, however, by their appearing also after the
oblique plural morpheme and the pronominal suffixes; v. § 175 ff.
102. The ezafa construction, borrowed from Persian, is occasionally
found in all the dialects; v. § 147.
103. The scope of the function of the oblique case depends mainly on
the case form employed for the agent in a ‘passive construction’.15 The
use of the passive construction with the past tenses of the transitive verb
can be discerned in all the dialects. The construction is found in almost
full force in Eshtehardi, where the agent is expressed in the oblique, the
logical direct object in the direct case, and the verb agrees in number
and gender with its logical direct object, when animate. With inanimate
objects, the concord of verb is generally abandoned, and the verb (in
fact, the verbal adjective) appears in the masculine singular form.
The most attenuated form of the passive construction is found in
Takestani, Xiaraji, Sagz-abadi, Danesfani, Esfarvarini, and Xoznini,
where the agent appears in the direct case and the logical direct object is
treated as the grammatical direct object, as if it were used with a present
transitive verb. Chali and Ebrahim-abadi have a middle position.","[75, 76]"
"PRONOUNS157intransitive verb, referring back to the subject of the verb, e.g.
Tak. belangasce (i.e., -st-se, v. below) ‘he limped’
Sag. hammam-esun besu (103) ‘they went to the bath’225. In Takestani a stem-final dental stop (-1, -d) of a transitive verb
merges with the 3rd person singular enclitic pronoun -s into an affricate
c, which is generally followed by a euphonic -e (v. § 298). The same
phonetic change occurs in the 3rd person plural, although much less
frequently, since in this case more frequent use is made of the connective
vowel (v. § 221), which separates the enclitic pronoun from the verb.
Tak.vace < vat-s-e ‘he said’
borce < bord-s-e ‘he brought’
vacun < vat-sun ‘they said’
borcun < bord-sun ‘they brought’By extension, this form may occur even when the enclitic pronoun has
appeared earlier in the sentence, e.g.
Tak.xazza-s bexarce ‘he slid (lit. he took a sliding)’
av gandem-es jdve-ra beborce ‘he brought wheat to him’
5. Possessive Personal Pronouns226. As has been seen (§ 217), oblique personal pronouns are used also
as possessive pronouns and adjectives. Examples:
Cha.em cemen-e ‘this is mine’Tak.az este-yme ‘I am yours’Esh.cemen-ya ‘it is mine’Xia.anai savi ba ‘bring his shirt’Sag.besa jem kid (119) ‘go to his house’Dan.ceme armaz bo ‘bring my clothes’Xoz.cemen dasa bigi ‘take my hand’V. § 217, a for further examples.
Enclitic pronouns (§ 220) may also function as possessive pronouns, e.g.
Tak.das-em-a yd darzena ‘there is a needle in my hand’Dan.bara-m adi da besarn ‘give [me] my spade, so that I go’
geysen-i anemidam ‘I don’t give [you] your ploughshare’V. 222, a for further examples.
227. In Chali the following set of pronouns, made up of the oblique
personal pronouns (v. § 217) and the suffix -kin, are also used as possessive
pronouns:
Cha.cemenkin ‘mine’
estakin ‘thine’
jaykin ‘his’158MORPHOLOGYjayakin ‘hers’
cemakin ‘ours5
sbmakin ‘yours5
jayokin ‘theirs5
cemenkin niago-ye ‘mine is here’
jaykin kiago-ye ‘where is his?5
Cf. eskakin ‘whose?5B. DEMONSTRATIVE PRONOUNS1. General Remarks228. Southern Tati has a system of two demonstrative pronouns,
proximate and remote, with at least two forms for each: direct and
oblique. Some of the dialects possess additional forms of the oblique:
Chali has two additional sets, here called agential (v. § 230, c) and post¬
positional (v. § 230, d). Takestani, Ebrahim-abadi, and Esfarvarini also
possess additional oblique demonstratives (v. below under each dialect).
Gender is distinguished in both direct and oblique demonstrative
pronouns, except in Ebrahim-abadi ma ‘this’ (masc. and fern, sg. dir.),
and Xiaraji and Ebrahim-abadi a ‘that5 (masc. and fern. sg. dir.).
The declension of the demonstrative pronouns follows the nominal
pattern always in gender (v. §§ 104, 133), often in number, and sometimes
also in case, e.g.
Xia.andi ‘that5 (masc. sg. obi.)
andi-a ‘that5 (fern. sg. obi.)
andi-un ‘those5 (pi. obi.)The 3rd person singular of the personal pronouns is identical with the
remote demonstrative pronoun.","[158, 159, 160]"
"Mammad Hasan-es xacar ujirat ‘M. married H.’s sister’Esf.soma nun-io bexord ‘you ate bread’224. As an agent, or a resumed agent, the enclitic pronouns may be
suffixed to a noun, an adjective, an adverb, a pronoun, a conjunction, or a
verb. When the logical direct object is a noun or a pronoun, the enclitic
pronoun is commonly suffixed to it. When the logical object is not men¬
tioned, or is a clause (as is generally the case with the verb ‘to say’),
it is the verb that most frequently attracts the enclitic pronoun. When the13According to the pronunciation of the Lower District; v. § 220, fn. 11.",[157]
"The proximate pronoun is also fre¬quently used as the 3rd person singular of the personal pronouns.
The use of the direct and the oblique case generally follows that of the
personal pronouns (v. below and §§ 214, 217).
The direct demonstratives are used as the subject in all the dialects
and as the agent in all but Chali, which has separate agential demon¬
stratives, and Eshtehardi, which employs the oblique demonstratives for
the agent.
The oblique demonstrative pronouns are used as a genitive (mainly
possessive), as the object of a verb,16 and as the object of a postposition.
The differentiation between the definite and indefinite object naturally does not
arise with pronouns.",[160]
"28INTRODUCTIONunity and coherence. So, as a rule, individual treatment of each dialect,
when deemed necessary, follows the general remarks.
The grammar deals with phonology and morphology only. Pertinent
syntactical matters, however, have been mentioned in the relevant sections
of the morphology (e.g., uses of cases, § 161 ff.; the passive construction,
§331 If.). Postpositions are discussed, because of their relevance to the
use of cases, under nouns rather than with other particles. The demon¬
strative pronouns, which presented some initial problems and seemed to
require clarification, have received a fuller treatment than some other
pronouns. Demonstrative adjectives are treated together with the demon¬
strative pronouns, as separating them seemed rather artificial. Adjectival
and adverbial suffixes are given under adjectives. Treating the adverbs as
separate from the adjectives did not seem to be warranted by the usage
of the dialects.
Since no printed texts are available37 for the majority of the dialects,
extensive examples are generally given to illustrate the rules. In such
arrangements, I have preferred to give weight to pragmatic convenience
rather than to strict methodology.","[29, 30]"
"156 The definite direct object, when singular, admits a variety of treat¬
ments with regard to its case. The main determining factors of these
variations are whether the object is inanimate, animate, or human, and
whether or not it is defined by an adjacent word.
a) When the definite direct object is a person, it is expressed in the
oblique case (but v. § 158, n.). When the definition is by a genitive or a
pronominal adjective, the oblique in -r (v. § 134) is used even if the noun
does not denote a family relative (v. § 136). Examples:
Cha.",[101]
"175 One of the distinctive features of Tati dialects is the frequent use
of postpositions with indirect objects. Prepositions are rare and generally
of borrowed origin, appearing mainly in affected speech.
All postpositions are unstressed. They may follow a noun or a pronoun.
When a noun is followed by an enclitic pronoun and a postposition, the
pronoun precedes the postposition (v. below, § 178 fT., for examples).
The object of a postposition is, generally speaking,1 expressed in the
oblique case. This is particularly clear when the object is plural, e.g.
Cha.kion-u ‘in the houses’Tak.culon-ada ‘in the pastures’Sag.darun-d becina ‘pick ye from the trees’When, however, a postposition begins with a vowel2 and its object is
singular, the -e ending of the oblique (v. § 104) disappears, and this creates
the impression of the object being in the direct case, e.g.
Cha.cemen jif-u ‘in my pocket’Ebr.ji zamin-a fayda ni ‘there is no profit in this land’Sag.jem cul-a ‘in this plain’Xoz.cdh-a ewa barow ‘bring out water from the well’Such postpositions, suppressing the oblique ending in the singular,
create case-like forms. The fact that they are not case endings is revealed,
however, by their appearing frequently also after the plural morpheme
and enclitic pronouns, e.g.
Cha. asbSn-a ci undi ‘give something to the horses’
umdlon-es-a maje ‘he tells his mates’
kia-ydn-u ‘from your house’
1
2The object of Esh. da ‘in, from’ is generally expressed in the direct case; v. § 190, a.
No postposition beginning with a vowel was attested in Eshtehardi; v. § 190.",[119]
"3. Agential Personal Pronouns218. Only Chali has preserved a set of agential pronouns:
men ‘I’
ta ‘thou’
&y, yi ‘he’
aya, ya ‘she’
amd ‘we’
soma ‘you’
ayo(n), yo(n) ‘they’
These differ from the direct personal pronouns only in the 1st and 3rd
persons singular, yi ‘he’, ya ‘she’, and yd{n) ‘they’ are, in fact, proximate
demonstrative pronouns (v. § 230 a).
These pronouns function as the agent in a passive construction. The
3rd persons singular and plural are also used as direct objects, both
logical and grammatical (v. § 230, c). Examples:
a) as agents,
Cha.men as(em) mipet ‘I used to cook food’
men quti esta da ‘I gave the box to you (sg.)’
men bekoste ‘I have killed’
yi kula gerat ‘he took [it] on [his] shoulder[s]’
ay-so banjand ‘they cut him’For further examples of the 3rd person, v. § 230.
b) as direct object,
ay berxin ‘buy it (referring to a ram)’
aya berxin ‘buy it (referring to a ewe)’
Note:Sot., 66, has Cha. az dardem ‘I had’, az midardem ‘I used to have’, which exhibit a
weakening of the use of the agential pronouns in Chali. My informants, however,
always used men in such cases.",[154]
"IV. PRONOUNSA. PERSONAL PRONOUNS213. Personal pronouns are divided into the independent and the enclitic.
The latter have but one form. The former, on the other hand, have at least
two forms: direct and oblique. Chali has preserved an agential set of
pronouns, which appear to have been used earlier in some other dialects
also; v. § 219. Independent pronouns generally distinguish the gender in
the 3rd person singular.1
1. Direct Personal Pronouns
214. The direct forms of personal pronouns (cf. Reseda, 63 ff.; A. A., 171)
are:

aztadaamasomaaynEsf.aztaaayaamasomaayend, aynXoz.aztaaayaamasomaahaThe 3rd person singular pronouns are the same as the remote demon¬
strative pronouns. Frequently, approximate demonstrative pronouns are
also used for the 3rd person personal pronouns (v. § 228 ff.). Feminine
pronouns generally follow the pattern of feminine nouns and end in an
unstressed -a when they have more than one syllable; cf. § 92.
Notes:1. Ur person singular - In Takestani and Sagz-abadi -z generally appears when the

indi midam ‘I give [it] to this one (him)’
andia mibarem ‘I take that one (her) along’
iii. as the object of a postposition,
andiun ku ugi ‘take from those (them)’
237. Xiaraji demonstrative adjectives are:
proximateremotedirectem, ema (f.)aobliquejejaXiaraji uses the feminine demonstrative pronoun ema also as an adjective,
e.g.
Xia.ema bara (f.) xara ‘this spade is good’Cf. em xuyyd (m.) xara ‘this shovel is good’
The use of ema with feminine nouns is not, however, constant; cf.
ema magowa baw ‘bring this cow’
but em beza (f.) pa deband ‘tie this goat’s foot’
Xiaraji direct demonstrative adjectives are employed also in oblique
cases as shown by the above two examples; cf. further the following:
Xia.em bar beba najjdre var ‘take this door to the carpenter’
em Hasane tetar bigir ‘marry this daughter of H.’
em qoce pa deband ‘tie this ram’s foot’

Gender is not distinguished in the direct singular (ma, a), but is distin¬
guished in the oblique I, when used for a person (cf. lack of gender
distinction in Xiaraji a ‘that’, § 236). For the object of a verb, separate
pronouns ('mana, ana) are employed in which gender is not distinguished.29
Oblique II is used in the dative and ablative sense, and also with the
postposition -a ‘in, from’. In the latter case a connective -r- generally
precedes -a (v. § 76). For jendi cf. Xiaraji indi (§ 236) and Esf. jindia
(§ 244). Fory'wa cf. Esh.jua (§ 234) and Esf.juro (§ 244).
-e in jime is probably an adoption of the nominal oblique ending (cf.
Sag.jeme, § 240; cf. further
Ebr.kemin naku-tar-e ‘which is better?’ (direct)but kemin-e ungurem ‘which shall I take?’ (oblique)
where the oblique of the interrogative pronoun is patterned after the
oblique nouns). Examples:
a) direct,

Ebr.jime/ji bebar ‘take this/that one (m.) away’
jima/jia bebar ‘take this/that one (f.) away’26 -e- is close, nearing i.
27 -a- in mahen is a close variety, apparently by the influence of -e-.
28 Normally dhen, occasionally aha, according to B. Dana’i of the Upper District.
29 I have no examples referring to animals, mana and ana examples were all obtained
from N. Dana'i from the Lower District. In these examples they do not appear as a
subject.","[166, 167, 168]"
"Thefeminine singular generally ends with an unstressed-a (but v §§92 n 2and 98).
In the oblique case, masculine singular nouns in all the dialects add an
The essential elements in a passive construction are: a) a past transitive verb; b) the
agent; and c) the logical direct object. Logically, the agent is the verb’s subject. Gram¬
matically, however, the agent does not stand in concord with the verb. It is the logical
direct object that is the grammatical subject of the verb, since the verb is in fact built
on a past participle and has a passive sense; v. § 331 ff. for further details75NOUNSunstressed -e. Feminine nouns, on the other hand, have the same ending
in the oblique as in the direct case, except in Eshtehardi where their
ending is a stressed -a in the singular.
Note:In Chali and Danesfani, the feminine singular oblique appears in some of my nota¬
tions with the stressed -a (cf. § 162, b, fn. 1) which would indicate a separate ending. In
Chali, however, the stress proved to be due to intonation or dominant sentence stress.
The same is apparently true in the case of Danesfani examples.","[76, 77]"
"96. In the case of nouns denoting animals, when no separate term is
used to distinguish gender, the feminine may be formed by adding -a to
the masculine, or, if the generic name is feminine, as in xara ‘donkey’,
the masculine may be obtained by dropping the feminine morpheme.
In some cases ma(ya)- ‘female’, or nar(a)~ ‘male’, is prefixed to the
generic noun to show its gender.",[72]
"They alldistinguish the two cases in both singular and plural, but not in the
feminine.
100. In all Southern Tati dialects an oblique case in -(a)r is employed
for a number of nouns denoting family relatives. This is a continua¬
tion of the older oblique ending of nouns originally ending in -tar. The
ending is extended in the majority of Southern Tati dialects (not, how13 Cf. also Cha. ambdri; Ebr., Sag. ambdri; but Tak. arimia; Esh. omberia (Zhukov¬
sky, Mat., II, 107b: onberia ‘pear’); -i- is, however, original here, from -u(d); cf.
Shandermani (Talesh) ambaru; Masulei amru\ Pers. amrud; Asalemi amb{u)ru
(suggested by W. B. Henning).
14 This assumption is also supported by the evidence of some closely related dialects
such as Nowkiani (in Upper Tarom), in which the same system is fully in force.",[75]
"D. CASE1. General Remarks
99. Among the Southern Tati dialects, Eshtehardi has a clear system of
two cases, direct and oblique. The distinction is extended in Eshtehardi
to both genders and numbers.
This system, which may be assumed to have been the basic system of
Southern Tati,14 appears in other dialects of the group only in weaker
forms.",[75]
"215. The direct case of personal pronouns is used for the subject in
all the dialects, and for the agent in all the dialects except Chali, which
has a set of agential pronouns (v. § 218), and Eshtehardi, which uses the
oblique pronouns.2 The direct forms are used in Eshtehardi also for the
logical direct object in a passive construction (v. § 165, d). Examples:
a) as subject,
Cha.ta az bom ‘until I come’Tak.ta-y da biru ‘you come, too’Ebr.ama naxesiem ‘we are sick’Esf.
b) as agent,az menome ‘I don’t come’Tak.az gandem-em esta ra bord ‘I brought wheat for you’Xia.az vindem he awa-s axwa ‘I saw that he drank water’
a farfa-s derutay ‘he has swept the snow’
a bevindes dozd difar-u miso jua ‘he saw the thief was
going up the wall’2For traces of agential pronouns in Xia. v. § 219.",[150]
"172MORPHOLOGYem and a are used also in oblique cases.
Note:In my materials only the remote demonstrative pronouns are used also as the 3rd
person singular of the personal pronoun.
emci and emcia were used only by ‘Amu’i.
jindia and juro are used in my material in a partitive sense.","[173, 174]"
"F. USES OF THE CASES IN EACH DIALECTIn the following section the function of the cases is illustrated separately
for each dialect.
1. Chali
161. The direct case is used in Chali for:
a) the subject, e.g.
Cha. Qamar Vazir pa-bu beso ‘Q. V. got up [and] left’
varziar-e bemandenda da sarbaz-e berasasend ‘the farmers
remained until the soldiers arrived’
b) the vocative, e.g.
Cha. Hasan ... mew berxin ‘H., buy [some] almond[s]’
ay pia-jon ‘O, dear father!’
52V. § 134.",[105]
"2. Inflection of Nouns
104. The singular — In the direct case, the masculine singular is expressed
in all the dialects by the plain (uninflected) form of the noun.",[76]
"97kiand xarab a-bind ‘the houses were ruined’ (v. 130, n. for
kiand)3. The Vocative
152. The vocative is expressed in the direct case, e.g.
Cha.zoma-jon-om xos omes ‘you are welcome, my dear
bridegroom’Esh.yd Hoseyn dad-em beras ‘O, H., come to my rescue’(v. § 161, b, n. 1. for a Chali exception.)
Note:In a Xiaraji example, the feminine morpheme is omitted after a feminine proper
name (v. § 120). Whether this is the case in some of the other dialects requires further
investigation. This is not the case with feminine nouns in general; cf.
Cha. kalaca-cesma, esbia-dandona ‘O thou, of black and white eye[s and]
white teeth (sg.)’
Tak. ey Narga nuya vaya ‘O new bride of Narga!’4. The Agent
153. In the syntactically more conservative Chali and Eshtehardi, the
agent, that is to say, the logical subject of a past transitive verb (v. §§ 103,
fn., 331 ff.) is expressed in the oblique.46 In Ebrahim-abadi the agent is
often expressed in the oblique, particularly in the speech of the older
generations, whereas in Xiaraji it is generally put in the direct case and
only occasionally, among some speakers, in the oblique. In the other
dialects the agent is expressed in the direct case.
1. Examples of the agent in the direct case:
Xia.
dada-m magawa-s bedust ‘my father milked the cow’
Sag.ta quce jem alafesun bexwa bemardend ‘as soon as theXoz.xarin bezastinda ‘the donkeys gave birth’rams ate the grass they died’
2. Examples of the agent in the oblique case:
Cha. sah-e bat ke ilci benda xedmat ‘the king said that the
envoys should come to [his] presence’
Esh.sir-e gawa beskiast ‘the lion crushed the cow’
gawd sir beskiast ‘the cow crushed the lion’Ebr.asb-e ewa-s dxa bemard ‘the horse drank the water [and]
died’46Cha. has even preserved a set of separate agential pronouns, v. § 218.",[99]
"24INTRODUCTIONIn Ebrahim-abadi, the sub-dialect of the Lower District24 has on and dm
(< an and dm, v. § 60) for the Upper District’s25 en and <?m.26 Again, in
the Qale District of the same village are found laqqe ‘branch’ and fe ‘was'
as against belazqe and bef, respectively, in the other three districts of the
village.
Such nuances account for a number of apparent inconsistencies in
spelling found in the examples quoted from the same dialect. Reference
has been made in the footnotes to such discrepancies in so far as it has
been possible to study them.
A second type of variation in each dialect results from the development
in time rather than the difference in place: the speech of the older gene¬
ration has occasionally preserved more archaic aspects of the dialect.
For example, in Esfarvarini the phrase xakaron-es-a ‘of his sisters’ was
given as an “old-fashioned” form of xakon-es-a (§ 134ff.) and apers-a
‘ask ye’, a good Tati word, as a form used by “old women” for the current
aval a-gir-a. In Eshtehardi, ia, the feminine of i ‘one’ (v. § 212), was still
used by my informants of advanced age, while only i was used by my
younger informants, xaka ‘sister’ is becoming more and more obsolete
in Eshtehardi and Esfarvarini, being replaced in Eshtehardi by bajia and
in Esfarvarini by dada.
In Ebrahim-abadi the use of the oblique case for the agent (§§ 153,
331 ff.) was found to be more common among the older than the younger
generation. It is interesting to note that the agential pronoun men ‘I’,
now lost to Xiaraji, occurs in the poems of Mira Kuru of that village.27
Generally the distinction of the feminine gender was found to be more
consistent in the speech of the older generations.28 As a rule, the general
tendency of the development of the dialects may be said to favor the
simplification and levelling of forms and the shedding of case and gender
distinctions.","[25, 26]"
"Hasan-e tetar agir ‘marry H.’s daughter’b) When the definite direct object is an animal, generally the oblique
case is employed. When such an object is defined by an adjacent genitive
or a pronominal adjective, occasionally the direct case is employed for
the singular. In careful speech, however, the oblique form tends to be
restored. Examples:
Cha. cemen ostbr-e berxin ‘buy my camel’
Esh.",[101]
"158 The logical object in a passive construction is generally treated as an
ordinary object except in Eshtehardi, where it is expressed in the direct
case (v. § 331 ff.). In Chali both cases are attested.
Note:Since the logical direct object is very often followed by a suffix pronoun, it is not
always possible to ascertain the ending of such an object, when singular.a) Examples in the oblique:
Cha. arusia mardemd... jibardrd ‘they gathered the people
(pi.) of the wedding’
Sah Ebrahimes zanar bard ‘Shah E. brought the wife’
Tak.ja gandeme bardem ‘I carried that wheat’
Hasane zanar ra da vindem ‘I saw H.’s wife on the road’Esf.bezon-es sar arbind ‘he slaughtered the goats’b) Examples in the direct:
Cha. do gave (pi.) -s ji bebard cul ‘and he took two cows to
(cf.pasture’ (v. § 110a)
dona gavon-es bebard cul ‘he took his two cows to
pasture’, a similar context in which, however, the logical
object is expressed in the oblique)60 Note that S. Tati does not possess a genuine post- or preposition equivalent to
dative ‘to’.",[103]
"PRONOUNS159Only in Ebrahim-abadi were separate demonstrative pronouns observ¬
ed in reference to inanimate objects (v. § 238). In Sagz-abadi gender is
distinguished in the singular oblique only when it refers to the animate.
229. Demonstrative adjectives17 have fewer forms than demonstrative
pronouns, since generally gender and number are not distinguished in
them (v. below under Esh., Xia., and Sag. for exceptions).
Whereas the direct demonstrative adjectives are always the same as
the demonstrative pronouns, the oblique ones have separate forms,
except in Eshtehardi, where the direct is used also for the oblique cases,
and in Sagz-abadi, which uses the oblique form of the demonstrative
pronouns also as demonstrative adjectives.
In Xiaraji, Esfarvarini, and to a lesser extent Chali, however, the use
of the oblique demonstrative adjectives is not consistent, and the direct
is used also for the oblique (v. under each dialect).
The demonstratives in each dialect will be treated separately below.
Demonstrative adjectives follow demonstrative pronouns under each
dialect. For a chart of the demonstrative pronouns and adjectives, v.

"Notice that the singular, inanimatedative object of a transitive verb is put in the direct case, as would be a
similar accusative object,50 e.g.

throw’, which are not followed as a rule by a postposition, generally
behave as direct objects, e.g.
Tak.qoc-e sang mazan ‘don’t throw stone at the ram’Esh.alaf-e misa da ‘give the grass to the ewe’Cf. § 156 6.

"INTRODUCTION22only when it refers to the animate (§ 240). Often a dative or accusative
object, when not defined by an adjacent word, is expressed in the oblique
only when animate (v. §§ 90, 154 ff.).
No attempt has been made here at a definitive grouping of the Tati or
Southern Tati dialects; it has been left for a subsequent work. However,
some general remarks concerning the relative position of the dialects
may be made.
The dialects, which properly speaking should be termed sub-dialects
(v. p. 17, fn. 4), may be divided first into Ramandi and Eshtehardi. The
Ramandi group consists of all the dialects spoken in the Ramand region
and also the dialects of Takestan, Ebrahim-abad, and Sagz-abad.21 The
geographical proximity of the Ramand villages corresponds to their close
linguistic affinity.
Eshtehardi, on the other hand, is spoken in a different bakhsh, and the
geographical distance between Eshtehard and Ramand is reflected in the
linguistic differences of their dialects. Whereas the Ramandi dialects are
easily mutually intelligible, Eshtehardi is a little less readily understood
by Ramandi speakers.
Eshtehardi differs from the Ramandi dialects by a combination of
features, the most important of which are:
1. The ending -ehd for direct plural nouns (v. § 114).
2. The possession of an oblique feminine singular ending for nouns
(-d), absent from the other dialects (v. §§ 104, 114).
3. The limited use of the oblique nouns in -r (v. § 140).
4. The ending -sin for the 2nd person plural in the imperative and the
past tenses of intransitive verbs (v. §§ 300, 317 ff.), and the present and the
subjunctive of the subatantive verb (v. § 347 ff.).
5. A more rigorous application of the passive construction (v. § 331 ff.).
6. The absence of the postpositions u/ku, a or a, and the presence of the
postposition beja ‘with’ (v. §§ 175, 190).
The Ramandi group may in turn be divided into Northern and Southern.
Northern Ramandi comprises Takestani, Esfarvarini, and Chali, with
yar/yard ‘to do’ as the most readily noticeable unifying isogloss of the
group, as against karjkard in Southern Ramandi.
Of the Northern Ramandi group, Chali appears to be more conserva¬
tive, as exemplified by its retention of agential pronouns in addition to the
oblique ones.
Takestani, on the other hand, is morphologically and syntactically less
21 Although these three villages do not technically belong to the Ramand rural
district (see above), they are actually a natural part of it and lie at its borders.","[23, 24]"
"48PHONOLOGYas a combination, as described in the case of Chali e (v. § 28), applies
equally here.
Before a nasal, e corresponds to Chali 6, e.g.
razen ‘gardens’ (Cha. razdri)
zema ‘son-in-law’ (Cha. zoma)
In a number of cases e is the result of the contact between a and a spread
front vowel, e.g.
naxose ‘she is ill’ < naxosa + e
besiese ‘you (sg.) have gone’ < besia -f- isa
61. In the dialect of N. Dana’i of the Lower District the vowel phonemes
were:
i, e, a, a, 6, o, u
d is [o(w)j (cf. § 32) and generally corresponds to e of the Upper
District before a nasal:
mon ‘middle’
boma ‘(that) I come’
In other cases e of the Upper District was replaced by ey in the speech of
N. Dana’i.","[49, 50]"
"155 The singular indefinite object is expressed in all the dialects in the
direct case. To make such an object definite, the direct case is replaced
by the oblique. Examples:
Cha.alaf undi cuare ‘give grass to the sheep’(cf. alafe undi cuare ‘give the grass to the sheep’)
Tak.saba gandem bar ‘tomorrow grind wheat’(cf. gandeme bar ‘grind the wheat’)
Esh.misa alaf mixare ‘the ewe eats grass’(cf. misa alafe mixare ‘the ewe eats the grass’)
Xia. pevl Hasane di ‘give money to H.’
(cf. pevle Hasane di ‘give the money to H.’)
Ebr.gandem bekiras yew a nakutare ‘it is better to sow wheat
than barley’Notice that since simple nouns, singular in form, generally have a generic or
indefinite plural sense, indef. dir. objects, plural in form, are bound to be rare.
48 Thus is to be read the sentence in the Arabic alphabet in the Resala, 57.
Since the fern. sing, does not generally change in the obi., this discussion concerns
only the masc. sing., except in Eshtehardi, where the fern. sing. obi. has a separate form*

"338. In Eshtehardi, and apparently in some other dialects (v. below), the
perfective morpheme and the copula sometimes follow the agent enclitic
pronoun (§ 332) when the latter is attached to the verb, e.g.
Esh.esta ta una hocco xers buindal bale buind-em-ia ‘up to
now have you [ever] seen a bear?’ ‘Yes, I have seen’

bed?’ ‘Yes, I have spread’Cf. cases of placing the perfective morpheme in the intransitive perfect
after the endings, § 317, n. 2 and 3.
In Takestani, beside vati-se ‘he has said’ and bexardi-se ‘he has eaten’,
103 -/- here is either a repetition of the 2nd person singular of the enclitic pronoun
followed by the perfective morpheme (v. below), or a borrowing of the intransitive
ending (?).
104 In the first part of the example la appears to be a feminine noun, but then one
would expect -ii in the second part (?) (v. § 317, n. 2).",[243]

"NOUNS67The use of the oblique case for the definite direct object, however, depends
on certain conditions. The rules of the Ebrahim-abadi usage, which is
typical, are given below as an illustration (v. § 156 for further discussion).
The use of the oblique case for a definite direct object in Ebrahimabadi depends on whether the object is inanimate, animal, or human,
and on how it is defined:
a) If the object is inanimate, it is expressed in the oblique unless
defined by a genitive or a possessive adjective, e.g.
Ebr.gandem-e beba ard ka ‘take the wheat [and] grind it’
ji gandem-e ard ka ‘grind this wheat (not that wheat)’
a mev-e me nen-a bare ‘pull out that hair from within the
bread’
cf. coma gandem beba ‘take out our wheat’
Hasan-e gandem ard ka ‘grind H.’s wheat’b) If an animal, the object is generally expressed in the oblique even
when defined by a genitive or a pronominal adjective, e.g.
Ebr.qoce beba ‘take the ram away’
cemen qoce sard berbin ‘slaughter my ram’
Hasan-e qoce sard berbin3 ‘slaughter H.’s ram’Some speakers, however, vacillate between the use of the oblique and
the direct.
c) If a person, the object is always expressed in the oblique; but when
the noun is defined by a genitive or a possessive adjective, the oblique
in -(a)r is used (v. § 134), otherwise the oblique in -e, e.g.
Ebr.cupun-e hamberaya beba ‘take along the shepherd’
ji miard-e beba ‘take along this man’butcoma cupun-ar beba ‘take along our shepherd’
dadar-em rayyat-ar mazan ‘don’t beat my father’s farmer’
Hasane amu-ar/bibi-ar beba ‘take along H.’s uncle/aunt’
cemen dosmen-ar raha-made ‘don’t admit my enemy’d) Masculine proper names of persons are expressed in the oblique in
-e, not in -(a)r, e.g.
Ebr. Hasan-e xdstane hamberaya beba ‘take Hasan together
with yourself’
Feminine proper names are expressed in the uninflected form, e.g.
Ebr.","[68, 69]"
"Bothnumbers generally distinguish a direct and an oblique case.4 Whereas
the dialects show general agreement in the oblique plural ending, the
direct plural ending exhibits considerable variety. (V. §§ 104, 105 ff. for
a more detailed discussion of number.)C. GENDER92. Southern Tati distinguishes two grammatical genders. Where there
is a natural gender it coincides with the grammatical one. The distinction
of gender may be observed in substantives, adjectives, certain pronouns,
and some verbal forms.
The gender morpheme in the singular is nil for masculine nouns and
unstressed -a for the feminine. In the plural, gender is not marked.
Notes:1. The feminine ending -a is generally less open and slightly less spread in Takestani
[e, a] than in Chali, Eshtehardi, and Xiaraji; v. §§ 30, 42.
2. Only rarely does a feminine noun end in a stressed -a, the three attested excep¬
tions being:
Cha. zania ‘woman’
nana ‘mother’
konya ‘houswife’93. a) Generally, the Southern Tati dialects agree in the gender of nouns.

range for most of the vowels, makes the determination of the phonemic
membership a task which requires much careful study. In addition, the
possible influence of Persian or Turkish on the commonly trilingual
Tati-speakers, as in the rounding of e similar to that in the speech of the
Qazvinis, as well as a tendency to harmonize the vowels, add to the
difficulty of the problem. These problems can be surmounted only by
access to extensive dialect materials. As the requisite amount of material
was not always available, the phonemic system presented here must, of
necessity, be considered tentative. In cases of doubt I have allowed for
variations of pronunciation in my otherwise phonemic transcription,
rather than deciding on a phoneme without sufficient grounds.36 Further¬
more, when occurrences of a given word with an assimilated sound are
infrequent, so that the phonemic nature of the sound may not be accura¬
tely deduced, a phonetic transcription has been preferred to a doubtful
phonemic one. Thus, Xoz. bo-xoras ‘that you (sg.) eat’ and Xia. db-roj
‘sweep!’ are transcribed as such even though the sounds which are
transcribed as o in bo- and 6 in do- might be allophones of -e.
Frequent dropping of final consonants (§ 79) presents another problem.
To decide whether Tak. ya or yard ‘(he) did’ is standard form is not dis¬
similar to deciding whether in spoken Persian e or ast ‘is’ is to be taken as
the standard form. In such cases the forms have been given as heard.
It goes without saying that further investigation is required to deter¬
mine details of phonology in the dialects and their subdivisions. For the
above reasons, phonological remarks, except for Chali, Takestani, and
Eshtehardi, for which more substantial materials were available, have
been kept to a minimum.","[28, 29]"

occurs an oblique form of xostan in -ar (cf. § 138, n.).48 Generally, re¬

explainable by the above general rule of thumb. In some of the dialects
(Xia., Dan., Xoz.) the distinction of gender is lost and -e serves as copula
for both the masculine and feminine.
In the other dialects, it seems that the feminine form represents - at
least in the majority of the cases - a combination of the feminine morphe¬
me -a and the copula for the masculine (v. §§ 28, 60, 81, 6; 116, a):

For examples of the distinction of gender in the substantive verb,
other than those given below under each dialect, v. § 346 ff.
For a chart of the gender distinction in verbs, v. § 285.
For possible cases of the feminine morpheme appearing after verbal
endings, v. §§ 275-276, e, fn. 1; 277, a, fn. 2; 278, a, fn. 1.
2. Chali275-276. Chali distinguishes the gender in the present of ‘to be’ (1st, 2nd,
and 3rd persons singular), in the preterit and the imperfect (1st, 2nd. and
3rd persons singular), perfect (1st, 2nd, and 3rd persons singular), and
the pluperfect (attested only in the 3rd person singular). Examples:
a) Present of the substantive verb,
Cha.yim(a)31/yem(a)31; enclitic, -im(a)/-em(a) ‘I am (m„ f.)’
yis(a)/yes(a); enclite, is(a)/-es(a) ‘thou art (m., f.)’
yi (or ye)/ya; enclitic, -e/-e ‘he/she is’
az yirna / az yema ta ta bayas ‘I stay (m„ f.) (lit. am)
until thou comest’
em dagga xwar-e ‘this male goat is good’
em beza xware32 ‘this [female] goat is good’30 One might treat the feminine forms of the copula as the result of -el-a ‘is’ and the
feminine morpheme of the word which precedes it; v. below.
31 For -(a), v. § 298 the euphonic -a/-e. For <?, v. § 81, d.
33 This may be analyzed as *xudra (fern. v. § 205) + e, but notice that ‘is’ has different
independent forms for the masculine and feminine.","[197, 198]"

330. Examples occur in Xiaraji of a conditional past of the substantive
verb, e.g.
Xia.agar vir-em fid mevatem ‘if I had remembered I would
have told’This form is used also in a pluperfect occurring in a conditional context:
Xia.agar bettati fia-ma berasasteyma ‘if I had run I would
have arrived’(cf. the same formation with the transitive verbs:
agar pevl-em gerd a-gerata fid meseyma Karbala ‘if I had
saved money I would go to K.’)96
Note:To decide whether the fia forms may be used in a non-conditional sense needs further
investigation.b) Transitive Verbs
1) The Passive Construction
331. The formation of past transitive verbs is marked by a particular
construction, commonly called ‘the passive construction5, which is
discussed here in some detail.97
The essential elements of a passive construction are: A) the agent, B) a
past transitive verb, and C) the logical direct object, e.g.
Esh. gawd (A) alaf (C) bexard (B) ‘the cow (A) ate (B) the
grass (C)5
Logically, the agent is the subject of the verb. Grammatically, however,
it does not stand in concord with the verb. The grammatical subject is the
logical direct object of the verb, since the verb is in fact built on a past
participle and has a passive sense.
In a passive construction one would expect the agent expressed in the
oblique, the logical direct object in the direct case, and the verb (a verbal
adjective in fact) to agree in number and gender with the logical direct
96 Cf. the transitive imperfect and common pluperfect in Xiaraji: agar midard-em ‘if I
had’, agar darda-m bef ‘if I had had’.
97 Cf. E. Benveniste, BSL, XLVIII, 1 (1952), where this type of construction is shown
to be, in fact, ‘possessive’.",[237]
"162 The oblique case is used in Chali for:
a) the genitive, e.g.
63V. § 81, a.
In this and the following example the object may be considered a direct one; v. §NOUNSCha.","[106, 107]"
"122MORPHOLOGYCha.dim-es u biabon yard ‘he turned his face toward the
desert’
das-em u esta damdn ‘[I stretch] my hand to your skirt
(i.e., I beseech your help)’If the dative object is not mentioned, u disappears and the accusative
object appears in the general oblique form, cf.
Cha.bar u zamin dsin ‘throw the door onto the ground’
bar u bon dsin ‘throw the door onto the roof’(but bar-e basin ‘throw the door’)
gel u difar ger ‘stick the mud to the wall’
(but gel-e soft a-yar ‘make the mud thick’)
dvo (i.e., ava + u) raz di ‘give water to the garden’
(but ava bebar ‘take away the water’)
When u is used as a postposition following a dative object, u may not
at the same time precede the dative object, cf.
Hasan-e pul u jar xaka yar ‘place Hasan’s money under
the earth (i.e., inter it)’
(but Hasan-e pul jar-u diar18 ‘hide Hasan’s money’ (jar
‘beneath’,19 Pers. zir)
The above examples encourage one to consider u also as a preposition
preceding a dative object. There are, however, the following points to
be taken into account:
i. When the order of the objects is reversed, i.e., when the dative
precedes the accusative, u generally disappears and the dative assumes
the oblique form, cf.
Cha.gel u difar ger ‘stick mud to the wall’(but difar-e gel deger ‘stick mud to the wall’)
zur u zamin di ‘give fertilizer to the land’
(but zamin-e zur undi ‘give fertilizer to the land’)
ii. When the accusative object is a person, u disappears, cf.
Cha.quc u pain19 dsin ‘throw down the ram’(but zaro (i.e., zaru + e, v. § 81, e) pain dsin ‘throw down the
child’)
barro (i.e., -a + u, v. § 81, c) bon dsin ‘throw the spade,
[up on] the roof’
(but Hasan-e bon dsin ‘throw Hasan [up on] the roof’)
18 According to Ameli Hasan pul u jar u diar is impossible. From the following
example it seems that when the verb has the -u- prefix, u does not precede the dative
object: zur u zamin di / zur zamin undi ‘give fertilizer to the land’.
19 An adverb which can be used as a noun.","[123, 124]"
"InChali the agent is expressed in the oblique case; in Ebrahim-abadi it is
expressed mostly in the oblique case, but also frequently in the direct
case (v. §§ 153, 161 ff.).",[76]
"Hasane sivun ce-s-da ‘give H.’s apples to him (inanimate
obj. defined by a genitive)’Sag.cappunun aziat macar ‘don’t bother the shepherds (def.
dir. obj.)’
besa Hasane razon ‘go to H.’s gardens (indir. obj.)’Ram. *besa bagd mardemun hun-zan baynda cema kid (57)48 ‘go
there [and] call people (pi.) to come to our house’
In the singular,49 however, the oblique case tends to give way to the
direct in a number of instances. The direct case is employed: i) when
the direct object is indefinite; ii) when an inanimate direct object is de¬
fined by a genitive or a pronominal adjective; iii) when the object is an
indirect one; and iv) except in Eshtehardi, when the object is a logical
direct object in a passive construction.
(a) Indefinite Object (cf. § 88 ff.).",[100]
"There is moredivergence among the dialects in the present and the subjunctive in this
respect.
The basic pattern of gender distinction may be seen in Eshtehardi (v.
below, § 378) which distinguishes the gender in the preterit, imperfect,
perfect, and pluperfect, i.e., all tenses built on the past stem (originally
a verbal adjective), and also in the singular present of the substantive
verb, but otherwise not in tenses built on the present stem.
In the other dialects, by extension, some tenses built on the present
stem also show the gender: all but Eshtehardi and Esfarvarini distinguish
the gender in the present. Takestani marks the distinction even in the
3rd. person singular of the subjunctive.21
Xiaraji, Danesfani, and Xoznini, on the other hand, do not distinguish
the gender in the copula, a distinction which is dying out in Esfarvarini
also.
Sagz-abadi, contrary to expectation, makes no distinction of gender
in the perfect or pluperfect (v. § 281, d).
The distinction in the 1st and 2nd persons singular, when it occurs at
all, seems to be rare.22
Past transitive verbs, which are governed by the passive construction,
do not mark the gender, except in Eshtehardi. Their concord in gender
in this dialect is, however, not with the logical subject, but with the logical
direct object (v. below, § 278, and § 331 IT).
The manner of marking the gender in verbs is basically the same as in
nouns, i.e., the feminine form ends in an unstressed -a when the masculine
form ends in a consonant, and in -ia when the masculine form ends in
-a/-e (v. §§ 92, 98). The forms of the perfect and of the present of the
substantive verb may, however, be considered special cases (v. below,
and § 346 ff.).
21 V. below, § 281, c, for the possibility of the same distinction in Sagz-abadi.
22 It should be noted that feminine forms in the 1st and 2nd persons singular have
sometimes been elicited in contexts made up for that purpose, or else in paradigms,
which lack the naturalness of the contexts produced by the informants themselves.
It is therefore not impossible that occasionally a rare form may appear as a regularform.",[195]
