"5.1.1.1 Case Marking
As mentioned earlier, Sidaama is a nominative-accusative language. Subjects are
in the nominative case, direct objects are in the accusative case, and indirect objects are
in the dative case. The following discussion shows how the grammatical relations are
coded by case marking on the heads of NPs (nouns or pronouns) (Chapter 3 section
3.2.1.1, Chapter 4 section 4.2.2.1.3) and adnominal constituents (attributive adjectives or
adnominal demonstratives) (Chapter 3 section 3.2.1.5, Chapter 4 section 4.2.2.2.1).
Nouns can be marked with case affixes, according to the patterns summarized in
Table 5.1 (see also Chapter 4 section 4.2.2.1.3).",[503]
"- 351 -Kazuhiro Kawachi A Grammar of Sidaama (Sidamo) Chapter 4: Morphology 3524.2.2.1.3 Case Affixes on Nouns
Sidaama is a nominative-accusative language. Case can be morphologically
marked by suprafixation (Chapter 2 section 2.3.2), suffixation, or both. The nominative,
dative-locative, allative, and ablative-instrumental cases are marked with suffixes, the
accusative and oblique cases are marked with suprafixes, and the genitive case is marked
both with a suffix and a suprafix. The following discussion deals only with case affixes
on nouns; see Chapter 3 (section 3.2.1.4) for case affixes on demonstrative pronouns.
The citation form of a noun, which occurs when it is a predicate followed by the
predicating noun-phrase clitic, =ho (M)/=te (F), has high pitch on its penultimate vowel
segment.16 The suprafix on a noun stem in the accusative, genitive, or oblique case
emerges as high pitch on its final vowel segment.","[372, 373]"
"- 484 -Kazuhiro Kawachi A Grammar of Sidaama (Sidamo) Chapter 5: Syntax 485When the head of an NP is a pronoun, the same relationship applies: subjects are
in the nominative case, direct objects are in the accusative case, and indirect objects are
in the dative case. Independent personal pronouns take the forms in Table 5.2 depending
on their case (Chapter 3 section 3.2.1.1). Although many of their nominative and
accusative forms look identical, they differ in their pitch accent patterns — high pitch
falls on the penultimate vowel segments of the nominative forms, and on the final vowels
of the accusative forms. The dative forms of the personal pronouns are formed by adding
the dative suffix -ra to the genitive forms.","[505, 506]"

Another set of demonstrative pronouns, which are derived from adnominal
demonstratives, also has distinct nominative and accusative forms (e.g., NOM: tini, ACC:
tee/tenne ‘this one (F)’, NOM: kuni, ACC: koe/konne ‘this one (M)’; see Table 3.15 in
Chapter 3 section 3.2.1.5).
Attributive adjectives and adnominal demonstratives are also case-marked. In
NPs whose heads are modified by these adnominal constituents, the grammatical
relations are indicated by the cases on the adnominal constituents as well as the head
nouns. An adjective that modifies the masculine head noun of the subject NP agrees in
case with that noun, and takes the nominative case suffix -u. An adjective that modifies
an accusative noun also agrees in case with the head noun, and both the noun and the
adjective will have the accusative suprafix, which is realized as high pitch on the final
vowel segment. An adjective that modifies a genitive noun also agrees in case with the
head noun, and is in the genitive case; thus, when a genitive noun is followed by the
dative case suffix -ra, an adjective that modifies it is also in the genitive. This also
applies to adnominal demonstratives, which can take different forms depending on the
case of the head noun (Chapter 3 section 3.2.1.5). See (5.2), where the cases of the
- 486 -Kazuhiro Kawachi A Grammar of Sidaama (Sidamo) Chapter 5: Syntax 487adjectives seeda, s i ima, and danc a agree with those of the nouns that they modify,
hanaat’icca, wot’e, and hakimic c  a , respectively, and the cases of the adnominal
demonstratives for ‘that’ and ‘this’ agree with those of the nouns that they modify,
hanaat’icca and hakimicca, respectively.","[506, 507, 508]"

Two sets of demonstrative pronouns (and their reduplicated forms) have the forms
in Table 5.3. Like modified masculine common nouns and /a/-ending masculine proper
nouns, their nominative forms end in the nominative case suffix -i (Tables 3.5 and 3.7 in
Chapter 3 section 3.2.1.4). Their accusative forms are marked with the suprafix, which
occurs as high pitch on their final vowel segments.",[506]
"Unlike thegrammatical cases on nouns, which can be morphologically marked, the grammatical
cases of pronouns are distinguished by their different forms. Many of the personal
pronouns for different cases may look identical in form, but as mentioned in Chapter 2
(section 2.3.2), different pitch accent patterns also distinguish the nominative case and
others on pronouns (as well as nouns) — high pitch occurs on the penultimate vowel
segments of the nominative forms and on the final vowels of the other forms.",[201]

Professor Jürgen BohnemeyeriiiDedicated to my family,
especially my wife and childrenivAck nowled gmentsFirst of all, I would like to express my deepest thanks to Dr. Abebayehu Aemero
Tekleselassie (PhD in educational administration), my Sidaama native speaker consultant
and teacher (from the Baansa district of the Sidaama zone in Southern Ethiopia), who has
provided me with data constantly over the years. He and I have had approximately one
thousand hours of consultation sessions so far. I owe most parts of my dissertation to his
friendship, his encouragement, and his patience as well as his Sidaama data and his
insightful comments on them. If I had not met him at the party for the Field Methods
class in Buffalo in 2001, I would not be able to be working on Sidaama, nor would I have
been able to write this dissertation.
Before I started to study Sidaama, I had worked on several different languages
(excluding English and Japanese) with their native speakers, hoping that I might be
inspired enough by one of those languages to write a dissertation. However, for various
reasons unique to each language, I could not continue to work on any one of them long
enough to generate a dissertation topic. After repeating the mistake of studying a
language halfway and saying good-bye to its speaker(s) several times, I was at a loss for
what to do for dissertation research. At that time, Dr. Abebayehu rescued me from
abandoning the idea of working on a language other than English and Japanese, by giving
me the chance to study Sidaama.
I am lucky enough to have been able to work closely with a person like Dr.
Abebayehu for a long time. He and I were only two floors away in the same building for
several years. He has always been cooperative, letting me ask him about Sidaama notvonly in my office and in our houses, but anywhere, including for example, at Tops
Supermarket at University Plaza, in my car, at the Buffalo Airport, and in one of the
surgery waiting rooms at Kenmore Mercy Hospital, he is always willing to make time for
my questions. He is very tough, and we have usually had a couple of two-hour sessions a
week, sometimes even a several hours’ session in a day. I don’t know how I can thank
him.
I would also like to express my profound thanks to my advisors for their
mentorship. I am very much honored to have been able to be one of their students. My
primary advisor, Professor Matthew S. Dryer, constantly gave me professional comments
and advice on my dissertation. Without him, I would never have been able to complete
my dissertation so fast. Professor Leonard Talmy gave me much advice and insightful
comments on my work over the long years. His every word has always executed a great
influence on me. I would also like to convey my sincere thanks to Professor Jürgen
Bohnemeyer for his constructively critical, detailed written comments and very
encouraging verbal comments on this study.
My gratitude goes to other professors in the Department of Linguistics at the
University at Buffalo for training me as a linguist, especially, Professor Karin Michelson
(who helped me decide on writing on Sidaama), Professor Jean-Pierre Koenig (who
always gave me encouraging advice), Professor Jeri Jaeger (who taught me basic
linguistic analyses and academic writing), Professor Wolfgang Wölck (who gave me
words of cheer and various delicious drinks), Professor David Zubin, Professor Robert
Van Valin, Professor Mitsuaki Shimojo, Professor Roger Woodard, and Professor
Colleen Fitzgerald. I would also like to mention that I gained tremendous benefit fromvithe Field Methods classes, which I took for three years straight here in Buffalo, and
learned very useful fundamental techniques of the elicitation of linguistic data from
Professor Karin Michelson, Professor Matthew S. Dryer, and Professor Colleen
Fitzgerald.
My special thanks go to Professor Norimitsu Tosu, my former advisor at Keio
University, for his continuous encouragement. If I had not studied linguistics under his
instruction, I would not be pursuing this discipline now. I am also indebted to Mr.
Makoto Ebihara, my ex-teacher at Keio Boys’ Senior High School, for directing my
interest to linguistic investigation in my younger days.
There are also many colleagues of mine who I would like to thank. First, Justin
Boffemmyer has read my entire dissertation and given me numerous helpful comments. I
would also like to express my thanks to my officemates, Valeria Belloro, Christopher
Phipps, and Rodrigo Romero-Mendez, for various discussions, and to my other
colleagues who gave linguistic and/or editorial comments on or who had discussion with
me about portions of my dissertation, especially, Justin Boffemmyer, Jerry Bove, Jennifer
Cornish, Ed Escott, Lilian Guerrero, Paul Heider, Sang-gu Kang, Heike Lehnert
LeHouillier, Atsuko Nishiyama, Luis Paris, Yukiko Sugiyama, Khaled Albahri, Yongeun
Lee (Northwestern), and Ichiro Yuhara (Chicago) (their titles are omitted).
My gratitude also goes to Carole Orsolits (Linguistics Department) and Heike
Jones (Center for Cognitive Science) for providing office space to work out of. I have
been able to collect data very efficiently thanks to this space.viiThanks also go to the Mark Diamond Research Fund, the College of Arts and
Sciences dissertation fellowship, and the Department of Linguistics summer research
grants at the University at Buffalo for partial support of the present study.
Saving the most important for last, I would like to convey many thanks to my
family, especially, my wife, children, and parents, for their support and patience. I
apologize for all the great inconvenience that I have caused (and am still causing) to them
because of the studies that I have been conducting over such a long period of time
without sparing much or any time for them and without earning any income. I will do my
best to compensate for this after I go back home.
Finally, please let me make an excuse. I would like the reader to be generous
enough to take my dissertation as a rough draft of my improved future work. Even
though my consultant is superb, I might have made some errors. Also, even though my
brilliant advisors have given me helpful advice, there are many portions that I have not
been able to revise. I have to submit this as my dissertation to the Graduate School now,
because of the deadline (coming in a few minutes!) set by a newly created rule. I hope
that I will be able to revise it as soon as possible. Maganu oohe! in advance again, Dr.
Abebayehu!viiiTab le of Conten ts

East Cushitic language spoken in the south-central part of Ethiopia. Sidaama is spoken
by over 1,800,000 people, but there has been relatively little research on the language.
Chapter 1 (introduction) gives background information on the Sidaama language
and the Sidaama people, briefly reviews previous studies, and discusses the methodology
used in the present study.
Chapters 2-5 use basic linguistic theory (Dixon 1997, Dryer 2006) to describe
the phonology and morphosyntax of Sidaama, and Chapter 6 examines the event
integration patterns (Talmy 1991, 2000b) as one property of semantic structuring in this
language.
Chapter 2 (phonology) lists the phonemes, the consonant clusters, and the
geminates, describes suprasegmentals (syllables and moras, pitch accent, intonation, and
pause), and presents morphophonemic rules.
Chapter 3 (parts of speech) describes characteristics of parts of speech. The
topics discussed in this chapter include types of nouns and verbs, similarities between
adjectives and nouns and between adjectives and verbs, various pronominal forms, and
clitics.
Chapter 4 (morphology) discusses reduplication of verb roots, suprafixes on
nouns and adjectives, and suffixes on nouns, adjectives, and verbs. It also examines the
ordering relationship of the suffixes.xviiChapter 5 (syntax) discusses four topics on the syntax of Sidaama. The first
section looks into grammatical relations in terms of how they are coded and in what
constructions they occur. The second topic of Chapter 5 is word order. The third section
of Chapter 5 discusses two types of external possessor construction, the oblique
possessum external possessor construction and the dative possessor external possessor
construction. The fourth section examines the structures of relative clauses and the types
of elements that can be relativized.
Chapter 6 (semantics) examines the semantic structure of Sidaama, which shows
characteristics of a verb-framed language, in terms of how it expresses different types of
events, using Talmy’s (1985, 1991, 2000b) typological framework of event integration.
It investigates how the schematic and the non-schematic components of the five types of
events (motion, state change, realization, temporal contouring, and action correlating)
appear morphosyntactically in this language.xviiiAbb reviat ions

grammatical structure of Sidaama, a Cushitic language of Ethiopia. Chapters 2-5 use
basic linguistic theory (Dixon 1997, Dryer 2006) to describe the phonology and
morphosyntax of Sidaama, and Chapter 6 examines the event integration patterns (Talmy
1991, 2000b) as one property of semantic structuring in this language.
This chapter is organized as follows.","[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22]"

noun.
Oblique arguments are either marked with case suffixes (specifically, the locative,
allative, or ablative-instrumental suffix; Chapter 4 section 4.2.2.1.3.6) or a suprafix (high
pitch on the final vowel segment). The latter type of oblique NP is headed by one of the
locational nouns (Chapter 3 section 3.1.1.3) or by the noun-phrase clitic =wa (Chapter 3
section 3.2.2.2), or is used in one type of external possessor construction, the oblique
possessum external possessor construction (section 5.3).11The oblique with the suprafix could be grouped with the accusative under a single case called the
“absolute” case (as is often done in the literature on Highland East Cushitic languages; e.g., Hudson 1976),
because the head noun of an oblique NP and that of an accusative NP are marked with high pitch on the
final vowel segment. However, the present study distinguishes the two, because unlike accusative NPs,
morphologically unmarked oblique NPs are always constituents not required by the valency of the verb.","[503, 504]"

sibling=NPC.PRED.MODIt should be noted that the use of adjectives like nouns is different from the use of
adjectives as nouns. In Sidaama, the noun modified by an adjective can sometimes be
omitted.33 In this case, the adjective modifying the omitted noun looks as if it were
serving as an argument. This happens when the referent of the omitted noun is
understood by the conversation participants to be a particular entity. It also happens
when the referent is compared to another entity that belongs to the category of the
omitted noun that has a property different from the one expressed by the adjective. For33Dryer (2004) points out that there are two types of cases where noun phrases without nouns (or
pronouns) (i.e., those consisting of elements that would otherwise be optional modifiers of “head” nouns)
are likely to be used: (i) “when the speaker does not know what kind of thing the thing that they are
referring to is” and (ii) “when the kind will be so obvious to the hearer that it can be left out” (p.70). Dryer
argues that in the case of (i), nouns do not have a privileged status in noun phrases, and proposes that all
noun phrases are headless; he questions the ‘head’ of an NP as a universal notion. On the other hand,
according to him, in the case of (ii), ellipsis of the noun is likely to be involved.
The use of noun phrases in Sidaama that do not contain nouns, as in (3.145) and (3.146), is an
example of the latter case. Such noun phrases in Sidaama can occur only when the hearer knows what the
ellipsed noun is.","[175, 176]"

Attributive adjectives agree in case with their head nouns. The agreement is
indicated with a case suprafix and/or a case suffix. The suprafix (high pitch on the final
vowel) occurs on adjectives in the genitive, accusative, and oblique cases just as on nouns
in these cases. Adjectives in the nominative case are not marked with the suprafix, and
have high pitch on their penultimate vowel segments (like predicative adjectives, which
occur before the predicative noun-phrase clitic =ho (M)/=te (F)).
When an adjective modifies a masculine noun, the adjective is marked with the
nominative/genitive case suffix -u if the noun that it modifies is in the nominative or
genitive case. For example, in (4.148) and (4.149), seeda ‘tall’, which modifies manc-i
‘person’ (in the nominative in (4.148) and in the genitive in (4.149)), is marked with the
nominative suffix and the genitive suffix, respectively. The nominative and genitive case
suffixes on an adjective have the same forms regardless of whether or not the adjective is
modified by an adverbial like lowo eessa ‘very much’.","[407, 408]"

Sidaama uses the word for ‘head’, umo, as the reflexive pronoun.46 It is always
followed by the possessive pronominal suffix. As shown in Table 3.5, the reflexive
pronoun morphologically behaves like a masculine common noun with a dependent or
the possessive pronominal suffix — it can be marked with the nominative/genitive suffix,
-i, and is morphologically unmarked when it is in the accusative case.","[203, 204, 205]"

5.3 External Possessor Constructions
Sidaama has two types of external possessor constructions (EPCs). Examples are
shown in (5.103a) and (5.103b). In one type exemplified by (5.103a), the possessum
noun is in the oblique case; the possessor, which is in the nominative case in this
example, is not in the same NP as the possessum. In the other type illustrated in
(5.103b), the possessor is in the dative case, and likewise does not form a constituent with
the possessum.(5.103) (a)hakku

In contrast, possession is internally expressed within an NP in (5.103c). In this example,
the possessor NP hakko manc-i [that.M.GEN person-GEN.MOD.M], which is in the
genitive case, modifies the possessum noun hat’o [nape(NOM.F)] within the NP hakko

As shown in (5.103a) and (5.103b), in EPCs, the possessor is expressed in a
constituent external to the possessum NP (e.g., Chappell and McGregor 1996, Payne and
Barshi 1999). Typically, the possessor is an extra participant, which is not required by
the valency of the verb but is still expressed as a core argument. Crosslinguistically the
most common construction types of EPCs are double accusatives (e.g., Bally
1996[1926]), applicatives (e.g., Blake 1984), possessum noun incorporations (e.g.,
Mithun 1996), and dative possessor constructions (e.g., Bally 1996[1926], König and- 532 -Kazuhiro Kawachi A Grammar of Sidaama (Sidamo) Chapter 5: Syntax 533Haspelmath 1998, Haspelmath 1999, Kawachi 2007b). An example of each construction

The suffixation for the genitive case involves the replacement of the final vowel of the
basic stem of a noun by the suffix or the addition of the suffix to the basic stem. The
dative-locative case suffix attaches to the basic stem or the genitive stem of a noun. The
allative and ablative-instrumental cases always attach to the genitive stem of a noun. The
nominative, genitive, and dative-locative case suffixes on nouns can have different forms
depending on three factors: (i) whether the noun is common or proper, (ii) the gender of
the noun, and (iii) (in the case of a common noun) whether or not the noun is Modified
by another element.
Note that “modification”, which is normally a syntactic notion, has to be used
here in a sense specific to Sidaama common nouns, and it is capitalized as
“Modification” (and its related forms are also capitalized whenever the distinction is
relevant: Modified, Unmodified, Modify, Modifier), as is done in Chapter 3 (section
3.2.2.1). Though affixation is not “modification” and nouns are not described as
“modified” (in the ordinary sense) by an affix, Sidaama common nouns accompanied by
the possessive pronominal suffix behave the same way in the selection of the allomorphs
of the nominative, genitive, and dative-locative case suffixes as those that have
dependents (in other words, those “modified” (in the ordinary sense) by genitive NPs or
adnominals), and these Modified common nouns behave differently from Unmodified
common nouns, namely those neither with a dependent nor the possessive pronominal
suffix. Thus, the use of the possessive pronominal suffix on a common noun counts as
Modification of the noun. As shown below, Modified common nouns behave more
similarly in some respects to proper nouns and pronouns than to Unmodified common- 353 -Kazuhiro Kawachi A Grammar of Sidaama (Sidamo) Chapter 4: Morphology 354nouns. The distinction between Modified and Unmodified common nouns is also
relevant to the selection of the predicative noun-phrase clitic when the noun is a predicate
(cf. Chapter 3 section 3.2.2.1).","[373, 374, 375]"

‘They told me that Lat’o kissed Dangura.’This clitic changes its forms, as shown in Table 3.18, depending on the gender and
number of the referent of the NP headed by the clitic, and inflects for case. The plural
forms used for (i) can be used regardless of the gender of its referents, but behave as a
masculine nominal. They are identical with the forms of the plural common noun for
- 240 -Kazuhiro Kawachi A Grammar of Sidaama (Sidamo) Chapter 3: Parts of Speech 241‘things’, re (SG: ricco ‘thing’), and serve as the noun-phrase clitic only when the referent
of the NP headed by them is animate.58 Note that, as shown in (ii) in Table 3.18, there is58The common noun for ‘a person’, manco and that for ‘people’, manna, are distinct in form from any of
the forms of this noun-phrase clitic.
There are several reasons to say that =re is a noun-phrase clitic when the NP is animate, and the
morpheme of the same form (re) is the common noun for ‘things’ when the NP is inanimate. First, only
when the NP headed by it refers to an inanimate entity can it be modified by adnominals other than genitive
NPs and relative clauses (specifically, adjectives including numerals and adnominal demonstratives).
Second, like =ta (F)/=ha (M), =re can be used for an animate referent only when its referent is already
known to the conversation participants; on the other hand, if its referent is inanimate, it is free from such a
restriction. Third, re, whose referent is inanimate, is number-neutral, and can refer to singular as well as
plural inanimate entities, whereas NPs headed by =re have to refer to plural animate entities.
However, there is one case where re can refer to animate entities. This transpires when followed
by one of the predicate forms of the noun-phrase clitic =ti in the predicate position, as in (i) and (ii).

either; as discussed later, there is actually neither a number nor a gender distinction made
for (iii), and =ta is used in most cases. In Table 3.18, there are two forms listed as nonplural, that is the feminine forms in (ii), =ti and =te; only =te contrasts solely in gender

When the masculine noun is in the accusative and is thus marked with the zero suffix and
the suprafix, the adjective that modifies it is also marked with the zero suffix and the
suprafix (e.g., duumo ‘red’ in (4.155)). When the masculine noun is marked with a case
suffix other than for the nominative/genitive cases (for example, the dative case suffix)
and is modified with an adjective, that case suffix is added to the genitive stem of the

former come before the latter, as in (3.117). Furthermore, both adjectives and nouns can
be marked with case (in (3.110) and (3.117b), the suffixes on the subject nouns have the
same form: seed-u and manc-u, respectively). However, the bases on which they are
case-marked are somewhat different. The case of an attributive adjective is determined
by the case of the noun that it modifies — for example, if the modified noun is in the
nominative case, the attributive adjective that modifies it is also in the nominative, as in
(3.109) and (3.110). On the other hand, the case of a noun that modifies another noun is
genitive, as in (3.117).","[160, 161]"

As discussed in Chapter 4 (section 4.2.2.1.3), the allomorphs of the genitive suffix
for masculine nouns are the same as those of the nominative case suffix for masculine
nouns, -u and -i, and the two allomorphs of the genitive case suffix and those of the
nominative case suffix occur in exactly the same set of conditions (Table 5.1; Tables 4.1
and 4.2 in Chapter 4). The locative suffix on both feminine and masculine nouns also has
the same forms as the dative case suffix, -te, -ho, and -ra, and these forms also occur in
almost the same set of environments (Table 5.1; Table 4.3 in Chapter 4) (the only
difference is that masculine and feminine proper nouns take -te and -ho, respectively, as
the locative case suffix, while both take -ra as the dative case suffix). Furthermore, the
genitive suffix on unmodified feminine common nouns has the same form as the dative
suffix on unmodified feminine common nouns, -te. Therefore, the grammatical relations
can be indicated by case marking, but the case and grammatical relation of an NP
sometimes cannot be precisely identified by the forms of the head noun alone.",[505]
"•There are lexical similarities among the HEC languages.1110Hudson (1976: 258) reports that unlike Burji, Gedeo, and Hadiyya, which have an independent genitive
pronoun, Sidaama and Kambata have a “genitive” (possessive) pronominal suffix and the use of an
independent genitive pronoun is uncommon in these two languages. However, this does not apply to the
dialect of Sidaama investigated by the present study at least. The genitive pronoun and the possessive
pronominal suffix are interchangeable in many cases, though the use of the genitive pronoun can be
emphatic in some cases; there are even cases where only the genitive pronoun can be used and the
possessive pronominal suffix cannot (Chapter 5 section 5.4.3).
11Lexical similarities among these languages are also investigated by Bender (1971).",[30]

-ra, and in (3.344), =re is in the nominative case.",[266]

Demonstrative pronouns are used to express locations deictically rather than
specifying particular locations with open-class forms. Basically, the demonstrative
pronouns make a three-way distinction in terms of three degrees of proximity of the
referent to the speaker in space: kawa ‘here’, hakka ‘there’, and ka’a ‘over there’; the
proximity of the referent to the hearer in space is irrelevant. Reduplication of kawa
emphasizes the closeness of the location (kawa kawa ‘very close’), whereas
reduplication of hakka and ka’a emphasizes the remoteness of the location (hakka hakka
‘way over there’ and ka’a ka’a ‘way over there’, respectively). The reduplicated forms
do not necessarily have to be used contrastively with their non-reduplicated counterparts.
The reduplicated forms, hakka hakka and ka’a ka’a, both indicate a remote distance, and
it is not clear whether there is a difference between the remoteness expressed by hakka
hakka and by ka’a ka’a. Like modified masculine common nouns and masculine proper
nouns ending in -a, the demonstrative pronouns take the suffix -i for the nominative and
- 189 -Kazuhiro Kawachi A Grammar of Sidaama (Sidamo) Chapter 3: Parts of Speech 190genitive cases. The forms of the demonstrative pronouns are shown in Table 3.6.

- 361 -Kazuhiro Kawachi A Grammar of Sidaama (Sidamo) Chapter 4: Morphology 3624.2.2.1.3.4 Dative-Locative Case Suffix
As indicated in Table 4.3, the dative-locative suffix is -ho for masculine common

the genitive stem of a noun. The genitive form of a Modified masculine common noun

(b)‘The woman’s son left.’
‘The man’s son left.’In (3.117a), the possessor noun (manco), which modifies the possessed noun (beett-i),
takes the genitive suffix for an unmodified feminine common noun, -te. In (3.117b), the
possessor noun (manc-u) that modifies the possessed noun (beett-i) has the suffix -u, but
this is different from the suffix -u of the attributive adjective (seed-u) in (3.109) and
(3.110) — the former is genitive and the latter is nominative. On the other hand, seeda in
(3.109) is not morphologically marked because the noun that it modifies (beetto) is
feminine and in the nominative case.
There are two other grammatical categories that adjectives have in common with
nouns: number and gender.
All adjectives make a number distinction. Unlike nouns, which can have
maximally three forms with respect to number (singular, number-neutral, plural), most
adjectives have two forms, singular/number-neutral forms and plural forms (Chapter 4
section 4.2.2.2.2).
Basically, as with the case marking on an attributive adjective, the number of a
predicative adjective corresponds to that of the subject noun, and the number of an
attributive adjective is subject to that of the noun that it modifies. As a general rule, the- 141 -Kazuhiro Kawachi A Grammar of Sidaama (Sidamo) Chapter 3: Parts of Speech 142plural form of an adjective is compatible with a plural subject noun or a plural head noun,
and the singular/non-plural form of an adjective is compatible with the singular or
number-neutral form of a subject noun or a modified noun. However, most adjectives
(e.g., dur-eette (F)/dur-eessa (M) ‘rich (M)’, du’ma ‘fat’, busule ‘smart’) do not have to
be pluralized for plural subject nouns and modified nouns, regardless of whether they are
used predicatively or attributively, as shown in (3.118)-(3.121), though a limited number
of adjectives (e.g., siima ‘small’, mikitiweelo ‘having no strength’) have to be pluralized
for plural subject and modified nouns, as in (3.120) and (3.121).","[161, 162, 163]"

In the IPC, the possessor NP and the possessum NP form a single constituent. For
example, in (5.109c), wosinc-u lekka forms an NP. On the other hand, both in the
Oblique EPC and the Dative EPC, the possessor NP and the possessum NP are separate
constituents. First, unlike the IPC, where the possessor NP and the possessum NP are
pronounced with a single intonational contour and without any pause between them, in
either type of EPC, the two NPs belong to different intonation contours, and a pause
usually occurs between them. Second, as indicated in in (5.109), the Oblique EPC and
the Dative EPC can use the pronominal object suffix (Chapter 4 section 4.2.2.3.6, section
- 537 -Kazuhiro Kawachi A Grammar of Sidaama (Sidamo) Chapter 5: Syntax 5385.1.1.2) that refers to an animate possessor. The pronominal object suffix is used usually
for a primary object or a beneficiary, and cannot be used for the possessor of the IPC, as
in (5.109c). This shows that, in (5.109a) and (5.109b), wosinco ‘guest’ is a dependent of
the verb and is not a dependent of the possessum lekka ‘foot’. Third, unlike the IPC,
which prohibits an adverbial from intervening between the possessor NP and the
possessum NP, as shown in (5.109a’) and (5.109b’), both the Dative EPC and the
Oblique EPC allow the occurrence of an adverbial in this position.(5.109’) (a)beett-u

constituents other than the verb is relatively flexible, though the possessor NP normally
has to precede the possessum NP. Thus, the agent NP cannot occur between the
possessor NP and the possessum NP in the IPC example (5.109c’’), whereas it can in the

wash-3SG.M-P.PRF.3Finally, in the Dative EPC, the possessum noun can be marked with the possessive
pronominal suffix that refers to an animate possessor, even when the possessor NP occurs
elsewhere, as in (5.109b’’’). In the Oblique EPC, the use of the possessive pronominal
suffix in addition to the expression of an animate possessor with a full noun or pronoun is
sometimes judged as redundant, though it is not ungrammatical, as in (5.109a’’’). On
the other hand, in the IPC, the possessum noun can never be marked with the possessive
pronominal suffix that refers to an animate possessor when the possessor NP is already
expressed with a full noun or pronoun in the genitive case, as in (5.109c’’’). The head of

For these reasons, the possessor NP is external to the possessum NP in both the Oblique
EPC and the Dative EPC. This applies not only to the two types of EPCs with a
transitive verb predicate like (5.109)-(5.109’’’), but also to the two types of EPCs with
other types of predicates (an intransitive verb and an adjective).","[557, 558, 559, 560, 561]"

with the preceding adnominal demonstrative, the use of the suffix -u rather than -i on it
for the nominative case and the genitive case, respectively, suggests that it is not
modified by the adnominal demonstrative. In (3.139), it acts as a noun — it does not
behave as an adjective here because the use of the genitive suffix -i rather than -u on it
indicates that it is modified by the preceding adnominal demonstrative. Unlike the words
in (3.130b) including eerco, which have uses both as adjectives and as nouns, those in
(3.130c) including seeda are basically adjectives, and cannot be used as nouns.
As shown so far, words that refer to a person’s property or ability or a person with
that property or ability can be used as adjectives, as nouns, or like nouns. These can be
classified into three types depending on whether they exhibit more noun-like or adjectivelike properties. The difference between the three types of words often emerges as a
difference in their order when they modify the same noun in the same NP. Although
multiple adjectives only infrequently occur as modifiers of the same noun, if they do, the
following ordering rule roughly applies: a pure adjective in (3.130c), which cannot be- 157 -Kazuhiro Kawachi A Grammar of Sidaama (Sidamo) Chapter 3: Parts of Speech 158used as a noun, comes before a word in (3.130b) that can be used as either an adjective or

"-2-Kazuhiro Kawachi A Grammar of Sidaama (Sidamo) Chapter 1: Introduction 3over the country including Sidaama.3 The literacy campaign lasted until 1991, when the
current central government came to power, and instead of taking over the campaign, the
new government started to permit the speakers of non-Semitic languages to develop their
own writing systems. After this change, the Sidaama people chose to employ the Latin
alphabet system, but the literacy rate at present still seems to be low.
As far as I know, there does not seem to be any dialectal study on Sidaama.
Hudson (1976: 233) states that Sidaama is “little differentiated into dialects” and that
“speakers of the different centers and Sidamo clans are identifiable by speech, but the
differences are minimal”. However, according to my consultant, there are large
differences among both regional and social dialects of Sidaama. In particular, there are
two clans whose varieties of Sidaama differ significantly from those spoken in the other
five or six clans. One of them is the yanase clan in the north, which is geographically
separated from other clans. The other is the haadiic c  o (Brøgger 1986: 34), whose
members are considered to do potters’ jobs and seem to be despicably treated by
members of other clans. Dialectal differences of Sidaama await further investigation.
Typological studies on Highland East Cushitic (HEC) languages (or Cushitic
languages, for that matter) tend to be based on phonological similarities and differences
of lexical items and the existence or absence of morphological categories, rather than3During this literacy campaign, some words were invented in Sidaama (e.g., ros- ‘to become educated’,
omma ‘tyre’, baabba ‘[honorific title (M)]’, kala ‘[honorific title (F)]’) so that it can express modern
notions.","[23, 24]"

When common nouns are used for the goal of a motion, the pronominal clitic =wa
is usually used, though the allative suffix can also be used in some cases with or without
a difference in meaning from the clitic (Chapter 3 section 3.2.2.2).
There are three types of nominals that always take the allative case suffix -ra and
do not take the pronominal clitic =wa when used for the goal of a motion: masculine
proper nouns for places, demonstrative pronouns, and locational nouns. All of these
types of nouns involve locations.18
First, when a masculine proper noun for a place precedes -ra, the noun is also
marked with the genitive case suffix -i, to form “STEM-i-ra”, as in (4.101a) and
(4.101b). When a destination is expressed with a feminine proper noun for a place, the
noun is used without any marker, and -ra is not used, either, as in (4.101c) and (4.101d).
18Note that the interrogative words for ‘where’, hiikko/mama, also require -ra (hiikk-i-ra/mam-i-ra
[where-GEN.PRON.M-ALL] ‘to where’), unlike ae ‘who’ and ma/maric c  o ‘what’, which take =wa
(ae=wa [who.GEN=place] ‘to whom’, m a-i=wa/maricc-i=wa [what-GEN.PRON.M=place] ‘to what’)
(Chapter 3 section 3.2.1.7).","[386, 387]"
"19Nevertheless, this analysis is based solely on my consultant’s intuition, rather than any grammatical
evidence. The oblique case has the same form as the accusative case, and there is no evidence that a
construction like (5.150) is not the Dative EPC; in other words, there is no evidence that k’ubbicco ‘finger’
is not in the accusative case.",[586]

The genitive suffix-marking pattern is similar to the nominative suffix-marking
pattern except that -te is used on Unmodified, feminine common nouns, as shown in
Table 4.2. Note that the allomorphs -u and -i replace the final vowel of a noun stem,
whereas -te is simply attached to a noun stem. The suprafix, which occurs as high pitch
on the final vowel segment of the stem, is also employed for the genitive case marking.
Thus, although the allomorphs of the genitive and nominative case suffixes of masculine
nouns, Modified feminine common nouns, and feminine proper nouns use allomorphs- 356 -Kazuhiro Kawachi A Grammar of Sidaama (Sidamo) Chapter 4: Morphology 357that are identical, their nominative and genitive forms are distinguished by the different
pitch accent patterns.","[375, 376, 377, 378]"

All these forms seem to modify a noun. Duuca basically means ‘many, much’,
but all the other forms mean ‘all.’ Wo’ma has a constant form, whereas duuca,
duuca-nta (F)/duuca-nka (M), and wo’ma-nta (F)/wo’ma-nka (M) inflect for the case of
the noun that they seem to modify, as in Table 3.20. Except for wo’ma, which has to
directly follow a noun, all the other forms can either immediately precede or follow the
modified noun; they can mean ‘all’ or ‘many, much’ depending on the position relative to
the noun, as shown in Table 3.21. The two pairs of inflecting forms, which contain the
emphatic suffix (-nta (F)/-nka (M)) discussed in Chapter 4 (section 4.2.2.2.3), show a
gender contrast. Duuca is only case-marked when the head noun is masculine and in the

The gender of such a noun usually emerges only morphosyntactically, for example, with
a case suffix on the noun and/or with a verb suffix, as discussed shortly.
There are also a few common nouns that are treated as masculine in some cases
and as feminine in some cases, depending on the gender of the proper noun that would be
able to be substituted for the common noun or on the gender of another common noun
that would refer to one of the subordinate categories. For example, k’ark’ara ‘village,- 82 -Kazuhiro Kawachi A Grammar of Sidaama (Sidamo) Chapter 3: Parts of Speech 83town’ is treated sometimes as feminine and sometimes as masculine. If a particular
village or town can be referred to with a proper noun (Feminine: ira, hula, yayie,
c’uuko; Masculine: bansa, awaasa, wondo, unuma), the gender of the common noun
k’ark’ara depends on the gender of the proper noun. If the gender of the place name is
not conventionalized, it can be either feminine or masculine (e.g., baffalo ‘Buffalo’).
There are also those common nouns whose gender depends on the gender of the
noun for a subordinate category (e.g., hakk’icco ‘tree’, c’e’icco ‘bird’, moicco ‘beast’).
For example, hakk’ic c  o ‘tree’ is feminine if the name of the tree is feminine (e.g.,
duuwanco ‘[name of tree]’, barzafe ‘eucalyptus tree’, weese ‘waasa tree’), and it is
masculine if the name of the tree is masculine (e.g., c’arric’o ‘euphorbia’, wajjicco
‘[name of tree used for lumbers]’, haeesa ‘[name of tree]’).
Feminine and masculine nouns have different morphological case marking
patterns. For example, in (3.6) and (3.7) below, where the subject is a noun that can be
used either as a feminine or masculine noun depending on its referent (manco ‘person’),
the nominative case on the subject noun manco is unmarked when it refers to a woman,
as in (3.6), and it is marked with the suffix -u when this noun refers to a man, as in (3.7).
The gender of a subject noun, together with its person/number, is also indicated on a
suffix on the main verb, as in (3.6) and (3.7) (-ø for 3SG.M vs. -t for 3SG.F; see Chapter
4 section 4.2.3.2).","[103, 104]"

A:The grammatical category of number in Sidaama nouns is mostly independent of
that of gender. As indicated in (3.13), the gender of a noun is arbitrary irrespective of
whether or not the noun is morphologically marked for number. The gender of a
particular number form of a noun is also unpredictable from that of another number form
of the same noun, though there are many cases where the unmarked or singular form of a- 95 -Kazuhiro Kawachi A Grammar of Sidaama (Sidamo) Chapter 3: Parts of Speech 96masculine noun has a feminine plural counterpart, and there seems to be no noun whose
unmarked or singular form is feminine and whose plural form is masculine.9(iv) Inherently vs. Optionally Possessed Nouns
In Sidaama, some nouns cannot occur by themselves and have to be accompanied
by a noun (in the genitive) or a pronominal (the genitive personal pronoun or the
possessive pronominal suffix), which refers to the possessor of their referent. (3.34) and
(3.35) show that iddo ‘inner part’ and lekka ‘leg’ are such nouns.10(3.34) a.*idd-u

(also, Teferra 2000: 41), but there are many counterexamples (including ‘iron’, ‘rock, stone’, and
‘elephant’).
10The locational nouns can occur without possessor nouns when the referents of the possessors are known
to the conversation participants, as in (i).

leg(NOM.F) exist.P.PRF.3‘There is somebody’s leg on that rock.’On the other hand, other nouns (e.g., mine ‘house’, kinco ‘rock’) are free from such a
requirement. The difference between these two types of nouns is between inherently (or
obligatorily) possessed nouns and optionally possessed nouns (Payne 1997: 40-41, 104107) (roughly, inalienably and alienably possessed nouns). Inherently possessed nouns in
Sidaama include nouns that refer to animate possessors’ body parts that are essential or
are not easily removable, kinsmen, spatial relations, and inanimate possessors’ parts and
spatial relations.11
However, if the referent of the possessor is clear from the context, animate
possessors’ body parts and kinsmen can occur without a possessor specified.12 First,
when possession is indicated with the verb of possession (af-i-- [find/get.to.know-EPMID] ‘to get, have’) or in the predicative possession construction (see section 3.1.2.3),Nouns that refer to relatively easily removable parts of body (e.g., dananco ‘hair’, hinko ‘tooth’, mundee
‘blood’) can stand alone. For example, their nominative forms can replace lekka ‘leg’ in (3.35b).
1112There is another type of case where the possessor is not required to be mentioned. When the general
function of a human body part is talked about, and the possessor is a person in general, it may not be
expressed, as in (i).

pronominal (e.g., ane rod-i [1SG.GEN sibling-NOM.MOD.M] or rod-i-’ya [siblingNOM.MOD.M-1SG.POSS] ‘my brother’).
Fourth, there are two types of constructions that allow inherently possessed nouns
to occur without possessor nouns in the same NPs. In the middle-voice construction
(Chapter 5 section 5.3.3; Kawachi 2004) and the external possessor constructions
(Chapter 5 section 5.3.1; Kawachi 2006a, 2007b), any possessed noun (not only
optionally possessed nouns but inherently possessed nouns) does not require the
possessor to be indicated as its modifier. In the middle-voice construction, where the
verb is marked with the middle-voice suffix, when the possessor (animate) is the subject
and the possessum is the direct object, the possessor does not have to be indicated as a
modifier of the possessum noun, regardless of the type of the possessum noun.","[116, 117, 118, 119, 120]"
"3.1.1 Nouns3.1.1.1 Properties of Nouns
When a noun is modified by another element or elements in an NP, the noun
comes at the end of the NP. NPs can serve as arguments, and it is only NPs that can be
arguments.
Schachter (1985: 7) lists case, number, class or gender, and definiteness as typical
categories associated with nouns. In Sidaama, case is marked with affixes on nouns, and
number and gender may be so marked, which is discussed below and in the next chapter
(Chapter 4 section 4.2.1). However, Sidaama nouns usually do not make a definiteness
distinction morphologically (except that as seen later in Chapter 4 (section 4.2.2.1.5), the
- 77 -Kazuhiro Kawachi A Grammar of Sidaama (Sidamo) Chapter 3: Parts of Speech 78suffix -nni can express the definiteness of the referent of a common noun used for the
goal of motion and for possession). For example, the referent of any of the NPs in (3.1)
and (3.2), can be interpreted as either definite or indefinite.1(3.1)seeda

(whether the noun form denotes a specific member of the category to which it refers or
refers to the category as a whole), which is a distinction similar to the definiteness
distinction, can be made (the choice of one of the number forms of a noun may lead to
only the generic interpretation when a verb predicate in the imperfect aspect or an
adjective predicate is used, though what form bears such a generic interpretation hinges
on the particular noun).","[98, 99]"

The event category of action correlating concerns what Talmy (2000b: 253) calls
“coactivity”, where one Agent performs an activity in correlation with a same-category
action performed by another entity, an Agency (either animate or inanimate). In a macroevent of action correlating, the co-event is in a constitutive support relation to the framing
event; the figure is the Agent’s action and the ground is the Agency’s same or samecategory action (or the Agency’s complementary action in the case of ‘demonstration’).
There are five subtypes of action correlating: ‘concert’, ‘accompaniment’, ‘surpassment’,
‘imitation’, and ‘demonstration’. In the first four, the Agent and the Agency perform the
same or same-category actions, whereas in ‘demonstration’, they perform differentcategory actions. English examples of concert, accompaniment, and surpassment are
given in (6.192)-(6.194), and German examples of imitation and demonstration in (6.195)- 800 -Kazuhiro Kawachi A Grammar of Sidaama (Sidamo) Chapter 6: Semantics 801and (6.196), where the framing event appears in a satellite (in italics) (Talmy 2000b: 257261).concert

Talmy (2000b: 257-261)The different patterns of mapping in S-languages and V-languages emerge in this event
category as well; S-languages express the framing event in the satellite, and V-languages
express it in the main verb. Compare (6.193)-(6.196) with the Spanish examples in

beautiful=NPC.F.PRED‘The rich woman is beautiful.’So far, it has been shown that adjectives and nouns can both be used either
predicatively or attributively, and that they inflect for case and may use the same
derivational suffixes. Despite these similarities, the ways that adjectives and nouns
utilize the three grammatical categories (case, number, and gender) are different. The
case, number, and gender of adjectives depend on those of their subject nouns or the
nouns that they modify. On the other hand, the case of a noun is determined by its
- 147 -Kazuhiro Kawachi A Grammar of Sidaama (Sidamo) Chapter 3: Parts of Speech 148relation to the structure of the whole clause, and the number and the gender of a noun
depends partly on both its referent and its lexical idiosyncrasy. This is mainly due to one
respect in which adjectives differ substantially from nouns — unlike nouns, which can be
modified by other nouns, adjectives cannot be modified by nouns. Another consequence
of this difference is that unlike nouns, which can be modified by a range of modifiers
(another NP in the genitive, a demonstrative, an adjective, a numeral, a quantifier, a verb,
and the possessive pronominal suffix; see the previous subsection), adjectives can be
modified only by adverbials.
Although adjectives and nouns in Sidaama have distinct characteristic
morphosyntactic properties, many of those words that refer to a person’s habitual
behavior, ability, and occupation, or to a person who has them, can be used both as
adjectives and as nouns. Examples of such words are shown in (3.130a) and (3.130b)
below.(3.130) a.oeessa ‘professional’

occupation, are less adjective-like than those in (3.130b). The words in (3.130b) have all
the morphosyntactic properties of both adjectives and nouns, and it is difficult to decide
whether they are adjectives or nouns. Many of them contain allomorphs of the singular
suffix, -aanc o , -co, -(aal)eette (F)/-(aal)eessa (M), or -(aall)itte (F)/-(aall)icca (M).
The present study treats the former as nouns and the latter as words that are
indeterminately adjectives or nouns, as discussed shortly (in the glosses for these words
in the examples, nouns are used for the former and adjectives are used for the latter).
There is another group of words that can be used to describe a person’s property or
ability, as shown in (3.130c). Unlike the words in (3.130a) and (3.130b), they are clearly
adjectives and do not behave as nouns. Most of them are adjectives that are not derived
from verbs or nouns (see (3.103)).
Words of these three types each show all the properties of adjectives. First, they
can modify nouns attributively, and their cases depend on those of the nouns that they
modify.","[167, 168, 169, 170]"
"3.2.2.2 Noun-Phrase Clitic: =wa
Sidaama has another noun-phrase clitic, =wa, which, like the noun-phrase clitic
=ta/=ha/=re, is bound to a genitive NP or a relative clause. This clitic is used when the
referent of a nominal is treated as an object rather than a location, and a vicinity of it is
the location or the source or goal of a motion; the clitic makes it possible to treat the
object like a location. Because a noun phrase formed with this clitic indicates a location,
the clitic is glossed as ‘place’.
When the clitic =wa occurs immediately after a genitive personal pronoun or
common noun, and is not followed by any suffix, it expresses the location of an entity or
the goal of a motion, specifically ‘at/to the location of the referent of the personal
pronoun or common noun or to an area where it is located’ (The following discussion- 258 -Kazuhiro Kawachi A Grammar of Sidaama (Sidamo) Chapter 3: Parts of Speech 259only uses ha- ‘to go’ as a verb that takes a goal complement, but applies to other verbs
as well).69
(3.370) and (3.370) are examples where the personal pronoun in the genitive case
isi [3SG.M.GEN] ‘his’ precedes the clitic =wa to express location and goal, respectively.","[279, 280]"

Also, as discussed shortly, constructions with the pronominal object suffix on the verb
that refers to a possessor, including those where the possessor is indicated not by a full
NP but only by this suffix, are limited to animate possessors.
Nevertheless, unlike EPCs in other languages, which tend to restrict possessor
NPs to certain types (typically, animate ones; sometimes, pronouns, especially the firstperson pronoun), neither type of Sidaama EPC imposes any restriction on the type of
possessor NP.
Fifth, as seen above, both have IPC counterparts which can always replace them
and are, in most cases, interchangeable with them, although there are often some
semantic and/or pragmatic differences among the different construction types, as
mentioned earlier and discussed later.
Sixth, when the possessor in either type of EPC whose predicate is a verb is
animate, the possessor may be indicated with the pronominal object suffix on the verb.
This may occur in the Oblique EPC when the predicate is a transitive verb, as in (5.144a),
- 562 -Kazuhiro Kawachi A Grammar of Sidaama (Sidamo) Chapter 5: Syntax 563and in the Dative EPC when the predicate is a transitive verb, as in (5.144b), or an
intransitive verb, as in (5.145). In these three examples, the pronominal object suffix -si,
which occurs at the end of the sentence, refers to the possessor, ‘that man’ or ‘him’.(5.144) (a)ise

In these examples, the possessor is already expressed with a full noun or an independent
pronoun, and the use of the pronominal object suffix on the verb is optional.18
A human possessor is often indicated only by the pronominal object suffix on the
verb, as in (5.146)-(5.150).
18Like the use of the possessive pronominal suffix on the PM noun in the oblique EPC, which is discussed
shortly, the expression of the possessor in this type of EPC with the pronominal object suffix can be very
emphatic or somewhat redundant when an independent pronoun is also used to express the possessor.","[583, 584]"
