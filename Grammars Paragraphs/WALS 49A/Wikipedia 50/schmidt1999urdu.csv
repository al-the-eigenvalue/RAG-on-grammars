Whenever a pronoun is followed by a postposition (for example, k6 reFirst and second person pronouns occur in the nominative case before theka , ‘of’, méth (+, ‘in’, SS , ‘from’ , etc.), it occurs in the oblique case,
as shown in the following examples.

postpositions (Chapter 5) as case markers. According to this school of thought, a noun followed

and I do hope it will serve as a model for future intrepid scholars in the difficult
terrain of South Asian grammatical studies.
New DelhiUrdu is a major language of South Asia which has been gaining in popularitysince the advent of independence of India and Pakistan. It is one of the eighteen
national languages listed in the Constitution of India, as well as the national
language of Pakistan. Unlike Arabic and Persian, Urdu is an Indo-Aryan language
akin to Hindi. Both Urdu and Hindi share the same Indic base, and at thephonological and grammatical level they are so close that they appear to be one
language, but at the lexical level they have borrowed so extensively from different
sources (Urdu from Arabic and Persian, and Hindi from Sanskrit) that in actualpractice and usage each has developed into an independent language. This
distinction is further marked at the orthographic level, where Hindi uses Devanagari
and Urdu uses the Arabo-Persian script indigenously modified to suit the
requirements of an Indo-Aryan speech. With this context in view, although the
grammars of these languages cover much common ground, nevertheless in order
to do justice to the differing sociolinguistic paradigms, separate materials have
to be developed for each of these languages, which taken together form the
fourth largest speech community in the modern world.
The grammatical tradition of Urdu and Hindi is now almost three centuries
old, beginning with Ketelaar in the seventeenth century and continuing through
Schultze, Forbes, Fallon, Platts, Shakespear, Gilchrist and others down to thenineteenth century. While Platts’ work has become a classic and is reprinted
time and again, the others have fallen into disuse. Lately, with inputs from
modern linguistics, and the fresh impetus given by Urdu’s new status as a
national language as well as a cultural vehicle of the Indo-Pakistani diaspora, the
need for new teaching materials is ever on the increase. The work of scholars
such as Barker, McGregor,Russell, Shackle, Glassman, Pray, Naim and othershas met some of the present need, however most of them have developed languageteaching books in which a discussion of the grammar is included as part of the
pedagogical requirement. As far as I know, no reference grammar of Urdu (or
Hindi) has so far been written, and it is precisely this gap which the presentvolume attempts to fill.
I have known Ruth Laila Schmidt for more than twenty years, since herstudy of Dakhini Urdu appeared. She is widely travelled in India and Pakistan,
spending years in research and teaching. Her research in the Dardic languageShina, and her Practical Dictionary of Modern Nepali, have in particular been
well received. She belongs to that brand of South Asian linguistic scholars who
deserve attention for their sense of dedication and thoroughness. It has been my
pleasure to interact with her on this grammar,and I found the work fulfilling.","[5, 6]"

"TRILITERAL ROOT STRUCTURE OF ARABIC WORDS
The TRILITERAL ROOT is the basic structure of the Arabic word. Most ArabicArabic elements in Urdu1501olse hisnazmpoetry259elaswinse Ui \e a5manzimtanzimmunazzam_intizamnizammetricorganization organizedarrangementsystemArabic derived verb formsArabic derives nine verb forms from simple verbs.' The simple verb is designated
as ‘Form I’, and the remaining forms are numbered from Form II to Form X.
Form IX does not occur in Urdu. Each verb form has its own verbal noun (VN),active participle (AP) and passive participle (PP). Arabic verbal nouns and
participles are common in Urdu, and the student will find it rewarding to learnthe formation of verbal nouns and participles.
The Arabic root ae(fa‘ala), which means ‘do’, is traditionally used as akey to demonstrate the affix and vowel patterns in the derived forms. The
function, derivation and formation of Forms I-VII and X of bs are shown in
Table 31 on p. 260. The verbal nouns and participles belonging to these forms
are shown in Table 32 on p. 261. Strong verbs (verbs which do not have the
letters « 9 <¢(’vy)as one of their radicals) conform to the pattern ofhe.words consist of three root consonants, or radicals (a few consist of four). ThePlatts, Dictionary of Urdu, Classical Hindi and English may be consulted forvowels do not belong to the root, but to the grammatical structure of the language.
Various derived verbs, with their associated participles and verbal nouns, are
formed by adding affixes and vowel patterns to the root ($1501). The derived
participles and verbal nouns (rarely the finite verbs) have been borrowed into
Urdu, and the Arabic grammatical patterns are evident mainly in semanticinformation about the derivations of Arabic vocabulary.
