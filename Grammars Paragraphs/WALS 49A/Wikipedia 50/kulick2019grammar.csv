"4.1.1 Noun phrase structure
Noun phrase structure is as follows:
[PossP Part HEAD Mod* Quant]=case
PossP is a possessive phrase and Part is a participle; the head follows these. In the
Mod(ifier) slot, either an adjective or a numeral, or both, in that order, can occur,
or a relative clause, or alternatively a possessive phrase. Non-numeral quantifiers
follow, and the final element of an NP is a case-marking clitic. The head noun
itself can be reduplicated.
Noun phrases themselves are readily elided, but if an NP is present, its head
is obligatory, or very rarely elided if retrievable from context. The head appears
together with any applicable case marking. The head can be a noun, modified or
not, or a pronoun. Some examples follow:
Subject NP expressed by free pronoun:
(4-1) ŋgɨ nam tankuro
ŋgɨ nam ta
-n -ku
-ro
3pl talk hear.r -s <3sg.f.r.o> -3pl.r.s
‘they heard the talk’https://doi.org/10.1515/9781501512209-0041064 Noun phrases: Structure, modifiers, case marking and possessionNumeral following the noun it modifies:
(4-2) nɨmɨr sene
stick two
‘two sticks’
Dative-marked noun functioning as oblique:
(4-3) ŋgomar =ana ŋgwok
fish
=dat go.3pl.r
‘they went for fish.’
Head noun modified by adjective and numeral:
(4-4) patɨr mokop manaw
patɨr mokop manaw
house little
three
‘three little houses’
Relative clause in modifier slot:
(4-5) ŋgɨ ŋgomar tarkwanŋgukŋa
ŋgɨ ŋgomar tar
-kwan
-ŋguk =ŋa
3pl fish
take.irr -3sg.f.ben.r.o -3pl.r =poss
‘they who were picking up fish’
Possessive modifier preceding and numeral following the head noun:
(4-6) ŋgan
nomb sene
3pl.poss name two
‘their two names’
The PossP element can be a possessive pronoun, e.g. yimen nirŋgar ‘our girlfriend’
or a full possessive NP:
(4-7) munjenum =mandama kokɨr
man.pl
=poss.pl
head
‘the heads of men’Participles with the non-finite suffix -(ŋ)gar107The head can be reduplicated, in the following cases to indicate plurality. The
first example has a rather complex structure, with ‘spouse’-‘spouse’ modified by
‘two’, all of which is taken up in the possessive pronoun ‘their’:
(4-8) ŋan omɨnde omɨnde sene ŋgan nomb sene ŋgankun

Note: A mbumjor snake is an extremely venomous black snake with shiny black skin
and blue stripes, well known to villagers because of the numerous deaths for which they
are responsible.","[125, 126, 127]"
"1.6 Tayap linguistic profile
Like many Sepik languages, Tayap is a synthetic language. Verbs are the most
elaborated area of the grammar. They are complex, fusional and massively suppletive, with opaque verbal morphology including unpredictable conjugation
classes, both in terms of membership and formal marking. There are very many
suppletive stem forms marking a basic realis-irrealis distinction as well as various
other TAM categories. Person/number marking also differs depending on the verb
type. This is a language of “baroque accretions” (McWhorter 2001); or what Dahl
(2004) calls “mature phenomena”.
There is a fundamental distinction in verbal morphology between realis and
irrealis stems and suffixes, but this distinction is overridden by transitivity in the
prohibitive and counterfactual forms.
Grammatical relations are marked by verbal suffixes, which distinguish
S/A versus O. In some conjugations S/A is marked by discontinuous morphemes. Free pronouns and noun phrases mark the ergative case (A) compared
to unmarked forms for the absolutive (S/O). As in many Papuan languages
which have an ergative case, the ergative marker is optional and is frequently
omitted.
There are two genders, masculine and feminine, marked not on the noun
itself but on deictics, the ergative marker, suppletive verbal stems and verbal
affixes. The unmarked, generic form of all nouns, including animate nouns,
even humans, is feminine: however, a male referent may be masculine. Another
criterion is size and shape: long, thin and large referents tend to be masculine;
short, stocky and small referents tend to be feminine. Again this type of genderassignment system is typical of the Sepik region.
Gender is only ever marked in the singular, never in the dual or plural. Nouns
generally do not mark number themselves, although there is a small class of
largely human nouns which mark plural, and a smaller class which mark dual.
These categories, where marked, are largely marked by partial or full suppletion. Oblique cases, largely local, are marked by clitics attached to the end of the
oblique NP. Two adjectives also mark number, with partially suppletive forms for
singular, dual and plural. A further two adjectives have partially suppletive forms
for singular and plural.",[45]

‘bad man’ (lit. ‘man who does bad things’)
In both the examples above, the participle formed with -(ŋ)gar carries the
meaning of habituality: the snake is (always) venomous; the man is someone who
is known for habitually doing bad things. These constructions also express agentive nominalizations – i.e. expressions like ‘killer of men’ or ‘doer of bad things’.
So a sentence like the following:
(4-13) yu yimbar andurgar
yu
yimbar
andur
2sg
canoe
carve.irr-gar
-nfn.sgmeans both ‘you carve canoes’ (often or habitually) and ‘you are a canoe carver’;
that is, the fact that you carve canoes is a characteristic by which other people
know you.
The same is true of the following sentence:
(4-14) ŋa sokoi aŋgar
ŋa
sokoi
1sg

consume.irr-ŋgar
-nfn.sgThis can be translated both as the habitual ‘I smoke’ (in the sense of smoking
regularly or habitually) and as the stative ‘I am a smoker’ (as opposed to being a
non-smoker).
The suffix-(ŋ)gar takes no TAM marking, even though it occurs in a position
after the verb stem that normally would be filled with an irr suffix (for intransitive verbs) or an object suffix inflected for TAM (for transitive verbs). The following sentence illustrates:
(4-15) munje kowot inde ŋɨ

person and number, according to the following pattern:

is add the negator wákare (see Section 5.2).
So compare:

neg4.3 The ergative case (erg)
Tayap optionally marks the subject (A) of a transitive verb with an ergative
case clitic, on noun phrases and free personal pronouns (note that subject and
object verbal pronominal suffixes follow a nominative-accusative system, see
Section 5.3).","[127, 128, 129]"
"4 Noun phrases: Structure, modifiers,
case marking and possession
4.1 Introduction
Noun phrases function as arguments of verbs: A, S, O and peripheral roles. Noun
phrase function is expressed with clitics marking A. O and S arguments are
unmarked, and oblique arguments are marked by clitics.
This chapter first discusses noun phrase structure, with a discussion of modifiers of the head noun. This is followed by a discussion of each case marker:
ergative, locative, ablative, perlative and dative. After this comes a description of
possession in Tayap. Young people’s Tayap is discussed in relation to ergativity
(Section 4.3.2) and peripheral case markers (Section 4.6).","[124, 125]"

are a subclass of nouns which function as bare locatives, i.e. they either do not
take case clitics at all or take them only sometimes, typically when they are in a
complex NP. Some examples:

Possession is marked by a possessive clitic on the possessor. Possessor clitics
mark higher animate singular (=ma), higher animate plural (=mandama) and
inanimate (=ŋa) possessors. Note also that Tayap has external possession constructions, discussed in Section 7.5 in the section on benefactives.
This clitic is also used to form relative clauses (Section 9.5), finite nominalizations (Section 9.6) and perception clauses (Section 9.7).
Example (4-44) shows the possessive clitic marking an NP consisting of a
modified noun ‘cold belly’, thus demonstrating the clitic rather than affix status
of these forms:
animate plural inalienable:
(4-44)imin pokemŋan munjema tɨk
imin pokem =ŋan
munje
belly cold
=poss man
‘the calm man’s story’=ma
=posstɨk
storyFor the purposes of possession, animals and humans are considered higher animates, and plants are considered inanimate. Possessive relations expressed with
this construction include alienable, inalienable, body part, association and partwhole possession. There is no morpho-syntactic distinction between these categories (but see Section 7.5 for the role of benefactive object suffixes in body part
possession).
Some examples:
animate singular body part (human):
(4-45)Mbanaŋma tokɨmot
Mbanaŋ =ma
Mbanaŋ =poss
‘Mbanaŋ’s chest’tokɨmot
chestanimate singular body part (animal):

The possessive clitic =ŋa(n) can also occur in construction with adjectives (see
Section 3.3 for more on adjectives). However in these cases the function is clearly
not possession but rather modification. For example:

The possessive clitic can also occur, similarly to the above examples, but on
nouns or verbs as well as adjectives, to create modifiers: for example, in (4-57)–
(4-58) it occurs on a noun, rendering it a modifier, and in (4-59)–(4-61) it occurs on
an adjective which here modifies a verb:

noun ‘child’. Example (4-60) has the same structure: the verb is followed by the
possessive-marked adjective, together modifying ‘woman’. Example (4-61) is more
complex. Here we have a head noun munje ‘man’, modified by adjective ‘bad’ and1344 Noun phrases: Structure, modifiers, case marking and possessionpossessive-marked verbs ‘sore’ and ‘smelly’. Note that these are the only constructions in which verbs can appear without person/status suffixes (see also Section 5.1).","[145, 146, 147, 148, 149, 150, 151, 152, 153, 154]"
"4.3.2 Ergativity in the speech of young people
Young villagers under thirty who narrated stories for me in Tayap produced ergative constructions in their speech, but they had a tendency to overuse the ergative
markers on intransitive verbs. The subjects of intransitive verbs like ‘be’, ‘cry’,
‘stand’, ‘talk’, ‘shiver’ and ‘work’ were all marked with ergative case marking in
various young people’s narratives.
Even when used in transitive verb phrases, the ergative morpheme was
sometimes attached to constituents that were not the subjects of the verb. For
example, one twenty-three-year-old man narrated a story about how a young girl
had accused him of having raped her.
In telling the story, he said the following (note that the ellipsis denotes a
series of false starts and repetitions that have been omitted, and the ergative morpheme is highlighted in bold):
(4-38) Mosi katota namnin, ‘Ŋayarke yu Yengia…morasi aproyi nitukun’?

is the ergative clitic, which the speaker attaches to the object noun phrase ‘bad
deed’ instead of to the subject of the verb phrase, ‘you’.
I suspect that this error occurred because the speaker seems to know that the
verb nir- (‘do’ or ‘make’) usually co-occurs with an ergative marker. But his sense
appears to be that the marker attaches to the noun or noun phrase that immediately precedes the verb; not necessarily the subject of the verb phrase.
This is a typical error made by speakers under thirty. It indicates that young
speakers have parsed the ergative case marker as a formulaic part of a verb
phrase involving certain verbs – in particular, the verbs ‘know’, ‘say’ and ‘do’.
But these speakers seem to be not entirely aware that the marker does particular
syntactic and semantic work. If the ergative case clitic was really a strong marker
of agency, control or animacy one might expect speakers to be aware of that,
albeit subconsciously, and make mistakes accordingly; however that does not
seem to be the case.
In addition to having problems with the placement and the function of
the ergative clitic, young speakers also often make mistakes of gender with it.
They overextend the feminine form =yi and use it when talking about males and
plural referents. So they say things like sas=yi (‘father=erg.f’, instead of sas=ŋi
‘father=erg.m’) and njenum=yi (dog.pl=erg.f, instead of the correct njenum=gi
‘dog.pl=erg.pl’).
This overextension of =yi probably occurs because =yi is the ergative ending
on the 1sg and 2sg pronouns (ŋa=yi and yu=yi). Speakers would have heard the
yuyi form all their lives, every time an older speaker ordered them to carry or take
or fetch or hit something. And since the narratives that people in Gapun tell one
another are almost invariably accounts of personal experiences – what the narrator him or herself saw, heard, dreamt, etc. – the ŋayi form would also be very
salient for speakers. Furthermore, the unmarked gender in Tayap is feminine see
Section 3.1.3. That young speakers would overextend the feminine form, rather
than the masculine =ŋi, is therefore not surprising.","[139, 140]"

Tayap examples in the grammar usually consist of four lines. The first is the Tayap
speech written in bounded, unsegmented words.
The second line is the same clause or sentence in which the words have been
separated into morphemes.
The third line is the interlinear gloss of the morphemes. The space separating
the morphemes in the second and third lines is larger than it is in most grammars
for reasons of readability. The usual manner of presentation, in which glosses for
morphemes are chained together in long, complicated strings, assumes readers
with a great deal of specialized knowledge, experience and patience. Separating the morphemes should make the glosses easier to process. The spacing does
admittedly make it a bit harder to see individual words, but those appear in the
first line of the examples.
The fourth line is the translation into English.
An example is as follows:
(1) Merewŋgrogi munje parŋgɨro
Merew -ŋgro =gi
munje par
-ŋgɨ
-ro
Sanae
-pl
=erg.pl man
bury.r -3sg.m.r.o -3pl.r.s
‘the Sanae villagers buried the man’
Suffixes are marked by hyphens (-) and clitics are marked with an equal sign (=).
In Tayap there are no prefixes, only suffixes, and enclitics rather than proclitics.
Some glossing conventions used throughout this grammar in the interlinear
glosses need to be noted. Tayap verbs – and other words – have a broad range of
meanings, and an o, for example, is consistently glossed as ‘strike’ in the interlinear glosses, but is translated to its context-specific meaning as ‘hit’, ‘stab’, ‘kill’,
etc. in the translation. Similarly, the Locative case has a broad range of meanings.
It is glossed as loc when it has a locational meaning but in other contexts it may
be glossed as temp for temporal, com for comitative or all for allative.
Further conventions need explanation are as follows:
The first is the pipeline symbol | which appears in example 3 below underneath the final morpheme -n. This symbol means that the morpheme it glosses
has more than one meaning. Disambiguation occurs through the use of pronouns
or nouns, or through context.
An S is used in glossing transitive verbs to show features of the subject. With
intransitive verbs, the person/number/status of subjects are marked in the language but there is no S in the gloss.
https://doi.org/10.1515/9781501512209-202Conventions and abbreviationsXIXAnother convention concerns Tayap’s discontinuous subject markers. Some
verbs have subject morphemes that occur both before and after the object morpheme. An example is as follows:
(2) ŋguyi aram tatɨŋgɨn
ŋgu
=yi
aram ta
-tɨ
-ŋgɨ
3sg.f =erg.f snake see.r -r.s -3sg.m.r.o
‘she saw a snake’-n
-r.sIn this verb, the combination of -tɨ before the object morpheme and -n after the
object morpheme encodes either a 2sg or 3sg.f subject in realis status. The
pronoun ‘she’ disambiguates the subject to be 3sg.f, in this case. Since it is the
combination of the two discontinuous subject morphemes that produces meaning,
the labeling convention adopted here is to gloss the first subject morpheme
with ‘s’ (‘subject’), and to gloss the combined meaning of the two morphemes
under the second morpheme. The object morpheme in verbs like this case occurs
between the two subject markers, and is bounded by < > instead of hyphens, to
show that it intervenes between the two discontinuous subject markers.
So in this grammar, the example above is written as:
(3) ŋguyi aram tatɨŋgɨn
ŋgu
=yi
aram ta
-tɨ
3sg.f =erg.f snake see.r -s‘she saw a snake’-ŋgɨ
-n
<3sg.m.r.o> -2sg|3sg.f.r.sThe abbreviations used in the interlinear glosses otherwise generally follow the
Leipzig glossing rules.
Note that the dictionary uses some different terms and abbreviations (see
page 351 for those).","[9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19]"
"2 Semantic error: the verb nam- ‘tell’ is incorrect here; the speaker wants kotar-(p)-e- ‘ask’.
Grammatical errors: the speaker omits the ergative clitic on the subject of the verb, and also
omits a locative case marker on Yengia, the undergoer of the verb. The grammatically correct way
of phrasing the question is:
ŋayar=ke yu=yi
morasi apro Yengia=nɨ
ni-tu-ku-n?
true=q
2sg=erg.f deed
bad Yengia=loc do.r-s<3sg.f.r.o>2sg|3sg.f.r.s
‘Is it true that you did something bad to Yengia?’Peripheral cases1214.4 Peripheral cases
Tayap has five peripheral cases. Three of the cases mark animate and inanimate
referents differently.
The possessive case marks possession, association and part-whole relationships, with no distinction between alienable and inalienable possession.
Possession is discussed in Section 4.5.
The locative case has the widest semantic scope of Tayap’s peripheral cases. It
specifies location in time and space, covering relationships that in other languages
are expressed in allative, instrumental, comitative, temporal and durative cases.
The ablative case expresses movement away from a person, place or object,
or an action of revelation in which something that was hidden becomes visible.
The perlative case expresses movement along, through or by means of.
The dative case is used to mark recipient, purpose, comparison and a number
of other relations.
All these peripheral case markers are clitics, as they occur attached to the last
element of an NP with scope over the whole NP: see for example (4-40i), (4-40j),
(4-42b), (4-43d), (4-43i), among others. Many of them contain optional material
(shown in parentheses), the conditioning factors of which are not known.
Examples (the relevant peripheral case clitics are in bold):

As noted above, ergative markers are clitics. They attach to the last element in
a noun phrase, and not just to the head noun (cf. Spencer and Luís 2012: 2). An
example of how they can attach to deictics and possessive pronouns that together
with their head noun compose a noun phrase is the following:

"4.6 Peripheral case marking in young people’s Tayap
For the most part, young people retain the ability to produce correct peripheral case
marking. They generally uphold the animate-inanimate distinction, and they correctly use the locative case. Locative =re sometimes causes problems when speakers
have analyzed words to which it attaches as whole constituents. So emb=re ‘in the
morning’ (morning=loc) is heard so often that it has been lexicalized by many young
speakers to mean ‘morning’, with the result that when they say ‘in the morning’,
they add the locative clitic and produce emb=re=re (lit. ‘in in the morning’).
Animate referents generally receive correct dative and locative marking. The
locative =nɨ on inanimate referents, however, is over-extended, probably because
of interference with Tok Pisin’s “long”. “Long” is a preposition that covers all the
meanings of Tayap’s various peripheral case markers, including ‘to’, ‘in’ and ‘for’.
So speakers say things like:
(4-62)a. oyaŋnɨ subimnakara
oyaŋ
=nɨ
subim
-nak
-ara
clam
=loc
dive (TP)
-1sg.f|1pl.r
-perf

Tok Pisin also influences the syntax of the case markers. A twenty-two-year-old
man produced the following sentence:Peripheral case marking in young people’s Tayap(4-64)135*ŋgɨ nunuk ŋa =nɨ
ŋgwek
3pl after
1sg =loc come.3pl.r
‘they came after me’The individual constituents that compose this sentence are all grammatically
correct. The problem is that the young man’s sentence is a calque of the Tok Pisin
sentence:
(4-65)ol
i
kam bihain long
3pl predicate come after
prep
marker4
‘they came after me’mi
1sgNotice that the locative clitic in the speaker’s Tayap sentence in (4-64) combines
with the 1sg pronoun (ŋanɨ) – just like the preposition in the Tok Pisin sentence
“long mi”. But while correct in Tok Pisin, the speaker’s Tayap is ungrammatical.
What he wants is as follows:
(4-66)ŋgɨ ŋaŋan
nunuk
3pl 1sg.poss after
‘they came after me’=nɨ
=locŋgwek
come.3pl.rA final consistent error made by speakers under thirty is that they use the locative
clitic to refer to named areas of the rainforest, whereas in Tayap convention these
nouns are bare adjuncts. So instead of saying yim mbok Konjamoran (‘we went
to Konjamoran’ – with no clitic added to Konjamoran, which is a named area of
the rainforest), young speakers consistently add a locative clitic, and say either
yim mbok Konjamoran=re, or yim mbok Konjamoran=nɨ, using the case marker for
villages (=re) or for unnamed places (=nɨ).
Young speakers may be doing this on the pattern of Tok Pisin, where such
marking, by the preposition “long”, is obligatory – in Tok Pisin, ‘we went to
Konjamoran’ would be “mipela igo long Konjamoran”.
But they may also be using locative markers because it is logical to do so in
Tayap: that fluent speakers do not use the locative endings on named areas of
the rainforest is a marked feature of this system. An alternative explanation of
why young speakers use the locative clitic here is thus that they are regularizing
Tayap’s case marking system.","[154, 155]"
"1.2 Past research on Tayap
The history of linguistic research on Tayap is very brief. In 1937, Gapun was visited
by one of the few white men ever to make it there. This was Georg Höltker, a
German S.V.D. (Societas Verbi Divini) missionary and anthropologist. Höltker
went to Gapun in the company of another missionary based in the coastal village
of Watam, and he spent three hours in the village. He took two photographs and
collected a word list.
A year later, Höltker published the list of 125 words, together with the weary
remark that “it will be awhile before any other researcher ‘stumbles across’
Gapun, if only because of the small chances of worthwhile academic yields in
this tiny village community, and also because of the inconvenient and arduous
route leading to this linguistic island” (1938: 280). (A translation of Höltker’s
short article is included here in Appendix 1, along with the two photographs he
took in Appendix 2).
Höltker’s brief squib remained all that was known about Tayap until the early
1970s, when the Australian linguist Don Laycock travelled around the lower Sepik
to collect basic vocabulary lists that allowed him to identify and propose classifications of the many languages spoken there. Laycock never visited Gapun, but
he did get as far as neighboring Wongan, and he interviewed two Gapun villagers who were staying there at the time, Kawi Waiki and Konjab Akumbi (Laycock
1973: 35).
On the basis of the word list and a few verb paradigms that he gathered
from Kawi and Konjab, Laycock classified Tayap (which he called “Gapun”) as a
sub-phylum of the Sepik-Ramu language phylum. In the classification terminology used by Laycock and his linguistic colleagues in the 1970s, this meant that
Tayap shared less than twelve percent of its basic vocabulary with other members
of the phylum, and also that it exhibited marked differences from other members
of the phylum – in Tayap’s case, gender pronouns and other differences relatedPast research on Tayap9to gender marking were mentioned. (The word list used by Laycock appears as an
appendix to his 1973 article. A discussion of the classifying criteria used to sort
out Papuan languages is in Wurm 1982: 65–72.)
Laycock included one other language in what he called the “Gapun
sub-phylum level family”. This was a language of over two thousand speakers, called Bungain. Bungain is geographically distant from Gapun (off to the
north and west of Map 1.2, see page 13), and Gapuners have no social, cultural
or economic ties or affinities with – or even knowledge of – Bungain speakers.
The relationship that Laycock postulated between Tayap and Bungain was not
based on any solid data or analysis – it was based on the basic vocabulary list
he used, as well as some rudimentary grammatical information, such as translations of ‘Give me tobacco’, ‘I cannot give you any, I have none’, ‘If I had some I
would give it to you’. Laycock himself noted that all his classifications of Sepik
languages were “tentative” and “impressionistic” (1973: 2). His description of
the supposed similarities between Bungain and Tayap, in its entirety, consists
of the following:
The languages show complex verb morphology, after the manner of Nor-Pondo languages
(subject marking by prefix in Bungain, and suffix in Gapun); but there is apparently no
noun classification, and no indication of number in nouns. Gapun has a third-feminine
pronoun; Bungain appears to lack this, but there is apparent gender concordance
in verbs.
(Laycock 1973: 35)Aside from the remark about complex verb morphology – which is a feature
shared by many Papuan languages – this description makes Bungain and Tayap
sound more dissimilar than similar (it also turns out that Tayap, in fact, does mark
number on a restricted class of nouns; see Section 3.1.3). In an attempt to assess
the feasibility of Laycock’s classification of Tayap and Bungain, I looked through
the field data on which he based the classification, namely his field notebooks D7,
D26 and D27, which are deposited in the Linguistics Department at the Australian
National University, where Laycock worked.2
Unfortunately, the notebooks turned out to be of quite limited use, because
Laycock often did not translate the vernacular words he noted down in his field
notebooks. He numbered the words, but his numbering does not correspond to2 I am grateful to the collective efforts of Melissa Crowther, Mark Donohue, Nicholas Evans,
Ewan Maidment, Doug Marmion, Malcom Ross and Nick Thieberger in helping me track down
and obtain scanned copies of these notebooks.","[28, 29]"
"4.3.1 Functions of the ergative case
In Tayap, ergative marking is “optional” (Foley 1986: 107; Dixon 1994: 58; McGregor
2010). This is typical in general of those Papuan languages which have an ergative
case (Foley 2000: 374; McGregor 2010: 1616). In many of these languages, ergativity
tends to be associated with a cluster of features, in particular agentivity, control and
animacy – most particularly agentivity, such that a more agentive transitive subject
is more likely to receive ergative case marking than a less agentive transitive subject.
However in Tayap, as in many other languages, ergativity seems to be sensitive to rather more factors than just agentivity.
The oldest speakers agree that most utterances that omit the ergative are perfectly fine Tayap. Speakers do not reflect on the grammatical role of the ergative
markers; the way they explain them is in terms of utterance length. They say, “if you
want to say it the long way, you say ‘ŋayi’ [i.e. ŋa=yi ‘1sg=erg.f’]. If you want to say
it shorter, you say ‘ŋa’” (“Yu laik skulim, em ‘ŋayi’. Yu laik sotim, bai yu tok ‘ŋa’”).
The functions of the ergative case in Tayap are rather opaque. The following
contrastive examples are intended to show that ergativity marking does not
equate simply to animacy, agentivity or control.

"Nouns59As the chart suggests, even though snakes and cassowaries are commonly
masculine, a short, fat snake or a squat, short-necked cassowary could be referred
to using feminine forms.
The shape-based assignment of gender is not entirely predictable, however.
A praying mantis is generally masculine, perhaps because its name is homophonous with ‘cassowary’ (i.e. ŋgat). And a millipede (kakámatik), even though it is
long, is generally feminine, perhaps because it is stubby, fat, and slow moving,
at least compared to a centipede (yandum), which is sleek and slithering (and
generally masculine).
Even though nouns tend to be generally classified as feminine, there are
some nouns which are always (in the case of natural phenomena and insects) or
tend to be (in the case of animals and birds) masculine.
The nouns in question are:
Natural phenomenaAnimals, birds and insectsarawer ‘sun’
ŋgudum ‘star’
nekan ‘earthquake’
aruat ‘thunder’
pora ‘wind’
urerŋgar ‘lightning’aram ‘snake’
kakarpwap ‘eagle’

kekékato ‘worm’
momɨk ‘guria pigeon’
nekan ‘stick insect’, Note:
homophonous with ‘earthquake’ŋgararik ‘monitor lizard’
ŋgat ‘cassowary’; ‘praying

This gender system shares some similarity with the East Sepik, Ndu family language Manambu, in which gender assignment is determined in part by the size
and shape of the referent (Aikhenvald et al. 2008; see also Reesink 2003 on North
Papuan languages). Aikhenvald et al. (2008: 112) note that shape-based gender
assignment is a feature of languages of the Sepik area, also citing Alamblak (Bruce603 Word classes1984). Other languages of the Sepik-Ramu region have gender, but very different
systems: Foley (2000: 366) notes for instance that Lower Sepik languages have a
phonological gender system; that is, gender assignment is based on the phonological form of the noun root.
On the other hand, the situational element to Tayap’s gender system – in
which gender is partly a matter of the discourse situation rather than a fixed
property of a noun – is reminiscent of that of Bilua, a Papuan language spoken
on Vella Lavella in the Solomon Islands. In Bilua, masculine gender is used
for third-person singular masculine human referents as well as “singulative”
non-human nouns. But all other nouns are marked feminine, the default form
(Obata 2003: 88, 105–109).","[78, 79, 80]"

"Most of these kin terms, and certainly their dual and plural forms, are moribund. Several of them – oiŋga ‘daughter-in-law, woman speaking’, njanimb
‘great-grandchild’, ombre ‘father-in-law, male speaking’, otre ‘mother-in-law,
male speaking’ – were produced only after several conversations among Gapun’s
oldest Tayap speakers. There is disagreement about whether one of them – eŋki,
‘husband of maternal aunt, male speaking’ – is even a Tayap word. Several people
suggested that it might be a borrowing from the Adjora language spoken in theNouns53nearby village, Sanae. However, since old men in the 1980s told me it was, and
since it has a Tayap plural, I include it here.
Villagers under forty all know common words like munje ‘man’, noŋor ‘woman’
and ror ‘child’, and they know their plural forms, but most do not know their dual
forms. Most kin terms have been either forgotten or replaced with words from Tok
Pisin. So oyeŋg ‘in-law’ has been replaced by Tok Pisin’s “tambu”, neni ‘grandfather’ has been replaced with “apa man”, and keke ‘grandmother’ with “apa meri”.
Words like mambrag ‘spirit of a dead person’ and kandap ‘forest being’ are kept
alive by mothers who use them to frighten their small children, so everyone knows
them. The plural forms, however, are not known by speakers under thirty-five.
The two non-human nouns that have plural forms are:
SingularPluraldognjenjenumpigmbormboreirum3.1.2 The animacy/genericness distinction in nouns
The animate-inanimate/generic distinction is fundamental in Tayap, and is
marked by two kinds of morphemes that are attached to nouns.
The first are peripheral case clitics, that denote relations like location or
dative (see Section 4.4). Several of these clitics have different forms for animate
and inanimate/generic referents. Note, for example, the different clitics that
express movement towards something or someone – an animate referent takes
=re and an inanimate referent takes =nɨ (see Section 4.4 for the complexities of
the animate/inanimate division):
(3-12) a. ŋgu
Mairum =re
wok
3sg.f Mairum =all (animate) go.3sg.f.r
‘she went to Mairum (personal name)’
b. ŋgu
mɨri
=nɨ
wok
3sg.f rainforest =all (inanimate) go.3sg.f.r
‘she went to the rainforest’
3.1.2.1 Animacy/genericness marked through possessive morphemes
Animacy/genericness is also marked on NPs by the enclitics that signal possession
(see Section 4.5 for discussion of possession). The possessive clitics express animacy/543 Word classesgenericness and number. They have optional consonant-final forms: The conditioning factors between the vowel-final and consonant-final forms are unknown.animate
inanimate/genericsingularplural=ma(t)
=ŋa(n)=mandama(t)
=ŋa(n)Examples are:
(3-13) a. mbor =mat ŋgagon
pig
=poss tail
‘pig’s tail’
b. Sopak =mat sapwar
Sopak =poss basket
‘Sopak’s basket’
c. mɨri
=mat mbor
rainforest =poss pig
‘wild pig’ – as opposed to a numŋa mbor, a domestic pig, of the village
d. num
sami =mat morasi
village many =poss custom
‘the custom of many villages’
The possessive clitics attach to the last word of the noun phrase expressing the possessor. The order between possessor and possessed is free, so both Sopak=ma(t)
sapwar (Sopak’s basket) and sapwar Sopak=ma(t) (basket Sopak’s), or mɨri=ŋa
mbor (forest’s pig) and mbor mɨri=ŋa (pig forest’s) are possible. Placing the np +
poss constituent last emphasizes it.
For animate plurals, the possessive clitic is =mandama(t). For example:
(3-14) a. Potow
=mandamat morasi
Wongan =poss.pl
behavior
‘the behavior of the Wongan people’
b. mbor rorsem =mandama tawk
pig
child.pl =poss.pl
plate
‘the baby pigs’ plate’ (that they eat from)
When speaking in general terms, =ŋa(n) is used even with animate nouns. For
example:Nouns55(3-15) a. munjeŋa morasi
munje =ŋa
morasi
man
=poss behavior
‘the behavior of man’ (as opposed to the behavior of pigs, or dogs)

3.1.3 Gender in nouns
Gender is a ubiquitous feature of Tayap. A common category in Papuan languages
in general (Foley 2000: 371), in particular in non-Trans New Guinea languages
(Ger Reesink pers. comm.), the pervasiveness of gender in Tayap, and the way it is
marked across the grammar, differentiates it from the languages that surround it
and gives it a reputation in the area as being a “hard” language.
Non-speakers of Tayap perceive the prominent role that gender marking
plays in Tayap because they hear speakers telling one another to do things, and
the imperative forms of intransitive verbs are inflected according to the gender
(and number) of the addressee(s).
So – to use the example that Gapun villagers themselves inevitably cite
whenever they explain the nature of Tayap to anyone – when you talk to a man563 Word classesyou say wetet (come), and when you talk to a woman you say wetak (come), using
gender-marked verbal affixes.
This feature of the language never ceases to astonish any Sepik villager who
hears it, and people from other villages who listen to Gapuners explain that they
have “two languages” invariably react as though such a language is so bizarre as
to stretch the bounds of credulity (see Section 7.1.2; see also Sections 3.5 and 5.3
for gender marking on pronouns and verbal affixes).
3.1.3.1 Gender marking
Gender in Tayap is a property of nouns, but is a morphologically covert category.
It is not marked not on the noun itself, but is expressed on the following targets:
(1) deixis markers (see Section 3.8); and/or
(2) ergative markers on the subjects of transitive verbs (see Section 4.3); and/or
(3) suffixes on the verb that encode subject and object (See Sections 3.5 and 5.3);
and/or
(4) suppletive verb stems (see Chapter 6)
For example, compare the following intransitive constructions:
(3-16) a. noŋor aŋgi patɨrnɨ wuk
noŋor
aŋgi patɨr =nɨ
wuk
woman dx.f house =loc be.3sg.f.r
‘the woman is in the house’
b. munje ainde patɨrnɨ kut
munje ainde patɨr =nɨ
kut
man
dx.m house =loc be.sg.m.r
‘the man is in the house’
Here, the gender of the subjects is expressed by both the deictic words (aŋgi/
ainde) and the gender of the inflected verb aku ‘be’ (wuk ‘she is’ versus kut
‘he is’).
Transitive verbs mark gender in object suffixes (see Section 3.5). Some classes
of transitive verbs (classes 4 and 5) signal gender and number on the subject suffix(es) as well. So compare the following non-future forms of the class 4 verb ŋgar
‘call out to’:
(3-17) a. ŋɨŋi ŋgu ŋganukun
ŋɨ=ŋi
ŋgu
ŋga
-nu -ku
-n
3sg.m=erg.m 3sg.f call_out.r -s
<3sg.f.r.o> -1sg|3sg.m|1pl.r.s
‘he called out to her’Nouns57b. ŋguyi ŋgu ŋgatukun
ŋgu
=yi
ŋgu
ŋga
-tu -ku
-n
3sg.f =erg.f 3sg.f call_out.r -s <3sg.f.r.o> -2sg|3sg.f.r.s
‘she called out to her’
In both examples, the object suffix -ku signals a feminine object (a masculine
object would be -ŋgɨ; see Section 5.3.1). But in a class 4 verb like ŋgar, the gender
and number of the subject is also obligatorily marked: in this example, gender is
encoded in the alternation between -nu + -n (combining to signal 1sg or 3sg.m or
1pl), and -tu + -n (combining to signal 2sg or 3sg.f).
Notice also the different ergative markers affixed to 3sg.m (=ŋi) and 3sg.f (=yi).
Other verbs (conjugation class 3 transitive verbs and some intransitive verbs)
also change their stem forms to signal the gender of the subject:
(3-18) a. mbori pap okun
mbor=i
pap
o
-ku
-n
pig=erg.f coconut consume.r <3sg.f.r.o> -3sg.f.r.s
‘the (female) pig ate coconut’
b. mborŋi pap kakun
mbor =ŋi
pap
ka
-ku
pig
=erg.m coconut consume.r <3sg.f.r.o>
-n
-1sg|2sg|3sg.m|1pl.r.s
‘the (male) pig ate coconut’
Here, again, the object suffix -ku signals a feminine object, ‘coconut’, and thus
remains the same in both sentences. But the verb ‘consume’ (a) is a conjugation
class 3 transitive verb, and in those verbs, the verb stem changes to signal the gender
(and number) of the subject, alternating between o and ka (see Section 6.1.4).
This verb-stem alternation is a source of serious difficulty for young speakers
of Tayap, as is discussed in Section 6.1.5.","[72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77]"
"1164 Noun phrases: Structure, modifiers, case marking and possessionFor those reasons, ŋɨ ŋgat poŋgɨn can potentially be understood to mean either
‘he speared the cassowary (with a spear)’ or ‘the cassowary struck him’ (that is,
pierced his body with the knife-like claws on its feet).
Using the ergative case marker resolves ambiguity by marking the transitive
subject who performs the action. So compare:
(4-30) a. ŋɨŋi ŋgat poŋgɨn
ŋɨ=ŋi
ŋgat
po
-ŋgɨ
3sg.m=erg.m cassowary shoot.r -3sg.m.r.o
‘he speared the cassowary’-n
-sg|1pl.r.sb. ŋgatŋi ŋɨ poŋgɨn
ŋgat=ŋi
ŋɨ
po
-ŋgɨ
-n
cassowary=erg.m 3sg.m shoot.r -3sg.m.r.o -sg|1pl.r.s
‘the cassowary speared him’ (with its claws)
Note that it is not the case that when two NPs (A and O) are present the ergative
marking must be used. The following example contains a verb that is highly transitive with two NP arguments present but there is no ergative:
(4-31) ŋgɨ ŋgomar tarmbrar ŋgwok
ŋgɨ ŋgomar tar
-mb
-rar ŋgwok
3pl fish
take.irr -3pl.r.o -ml go.3pl.r
‘They picked up fish as they walked’
However there are also many examples in which there can be no ambiguity, and
yet an ergative marker is used:
(4-32) mbumjorŋi minjikankɨ nda kokɨr kukupemiet
mbumjor=ŋi
minjikan -kɨ
Mbumjor_snake=erg.m nearby
-intensnda
dmkokɨr
headku
-ku
pemiet
bring -3sg.f.r.o rise_up.sg.m.r
‘the snake raised his head really close’
One verb that virtually always marks its subject with the ergative clitic is kirawwhen it conveys the meaning of ‘know’ (this verb also has a range of other
meanings, including ‘consider something’, ‘recognize something’ and ‘taste
something’); note that this example has the unusual structure of a preposed
head, with possessive phrase following.","[135, 136]"
"1104 Noun phrases: Structure, modifiers, case marking and possessionNote the difference in the first word of the following two sentences:
(4-19) a. Sopak wokara
Sopak
wok
Sopak-Ø
go.3sg.f.r
‘Sopak has gone’-ara
-perfb. Sopakyi taruŋg kratukun
Sopak =yi
taruŋg
kra
-tu -ku
-n
Sopak =erg.f firewood chop.r -s <3sg.f.r.o> -2sg|3sg.f.r.s
‘Sopak chopped firewood’
In (4-19a), there is no object, and the subject (S) of the sentence, Sopak, is
unmarked.
In (4-19b), Sopak performs an action on an object. That object, like the subject
of the previous sentence, is unmarked. But Sopak receives the ergative clitic =yi,
which identifies her as the subject of the transitive clause.
The ergative clitics that attach to the subject NP of a transitive verb also
encode gender and number. The markers that occur on NPs are:
=ŋi
=yi
=gimasculine ergative
feminine ergative (becomes =i when it follows r, t, nd, w and
often k)
plural ergativeNote that as in all other areas of Tayap grammar, gender is not indicated in the
plural number, so a word like rorsem=gi (‘children=erg.pl’) can refer to either
male or female children.
These ergative clitics are also attached to the personal pronouns in a pattern
that maintains the plural meaning of =gi but not the gendered meaning of =ŋi
and =yi on 1sg and 2sg. In other words, gender is not marked in 1st and 2nd
persons.","[129, 130]"
"There are also sets of object-marking suffixes, for the benefactive mood (Section
7.5), also used in the transitive progressive (Section 8.3.1.2), and also for non-final
verbs (Section 8.2). These forms are as follows, repeated here for convenience
(note that these forms are perhaps better organized by number than person, but
to parallel other paradigms they are organized here by person):

sense that for all singular subjects, including 1sg, gender is obligatorily marked
on verbs through various means that for some verb classes includes changes in
the verb stem itself.
For example, note how the imperfective form of the verb ‘go’ (o) changes to
express gender for singular subjects:

second person: feminine and masculine first-person singular are both ŋa; feminine and masculine second-person singular are both yu. The pronominal system
distinguishes gender only in third-person singular (ŋɨ ‘he’ and ŋgu ‘she’). For
plural subjects, there is no gender distinction, neither in the pronominal system
nor in the morphology of verbs.
A further divergence between the pronominal system and verb morphology is
that Tayap, as noted above, has no separate dual pronoun, but it does have a dual
verb inflection for both transitive verbs (-re) and intransitive verbs (-tike). This
inflection signals ‘we two’ (1dl) or ‘the two of them’ (3dl).
Note, though, that ‘you two’ (2dl) is expressed with the second person plural
(yum) form of the verb. Compare:
(3-73)a. dual

The lexical class of verbs is an open class which can be characterized as being
able to host realis/irrealis status and transitivity suffixes as well as subject and
object suffixes. A fully inflected verb can function as the sole word of a sentence.
There are two major subclasses of verbs: intransitive and transitive. Examples
of each are:

‘I saw you’
There are no ditransitive verbs in Tayap (see also Section 9.1). Semantically threeplace predicates express the recipient of giving, for example, with the benefactive
morpheme:
(3-30) is
-iata
-n
give.sbj -1sg.ben.r.o -sg|1pl.r
‘(you) give it to me!’
However the recipient can be omitted, indicating that the verb in question is transitive, not ditransitive, and that the benefactive morpheme is an optional oblique
argument:
(3-31) epi
i
-kru
-net
tomorrow give.irr -3sg.f.irr.o -1sg.m|3sg.m.irr.s
‘I (m) will give it (to someone) tomorrow’
Benefactive objects and regular objects cannot coocur in the same clause.
As well as being divided into transitivity classes, every Tayap verb falls
into one of nine conjugation classes, based on how verbs form their non-future
forms: there are five classes for transitive verbs and four for intransitives (see
Chapter 6).
Verb morphology in Tayap is entirely suffixing, with morphemes for object
and subject added – in that order, apart from discontinuous subject markers – to
verb stems. A characteristic feature of Tayap verbs is that status is marked across
the verb multiple times. The stem must occur in either an irrealis or realis form.
In addition, the object and subject morphemes that get suffixed to the stem also
encode realis/irrealis status.
This can be illustrated with an example from the transitive verb stem o, which
means ‘strike’ (and covers actions like ‘shoot’, ‘stab’ and ‘hit’). Note how irrealis
vs. realis is marked across the verb (in bold):Verbs65(3-32) a. pokun

The same thing happens with intransitive verbs, exemplified here with the verb
memkɨ ‘get up’:
(3-33) a. pemiet
pem
-iet

Status2marking on verbs, while mandatory, does not always occur in predictable
ways. Realis morphemes can occur as part of a verb that refers to an unreal event.
An example is the counterfactual mood (cf), which is a prototypical irrealis category, because it refers to events that never occurred, such as ‘If he had seen it, he
would have shot it’. However in Tayap, on transitive verbs, the counterfactual is2 Note that the negative verb requires irrealis marking, see Section 5.4.2.1.","[82, 83, 84, 85]"

‘He saw Akupi [’s spirit]’4.3.1.1 Ergative clitics on intransitive verbs
The main function of ergative clitics is to mark the subject of a transitive verb.
In Tayap, however, the ergative marker can also be attached to the subject of an
intransitive verb.
This marked use often carries a particular nuance, which can be illustrated
by an example taken from a narrative about a powerful crocodile water-spirit
named Ŋgayam. In telling this story, the narrator uses the ergative with an intransitive verb:
(4-35) Ŋgayamŋi mbet
Ŋgayam =ŋi
mbet
Ŋgayam =erg.m come.3sg.m.r
‘Ŋgayam came’1184 Noun phrases: Structure, modifiers, case marking and possessionThe ergative here carries the connotation of purposefulness. The implication
is that Ŋgayam didn’t just come – he came with a purpose, to do something, to
perform some kind of action. And indeed he did: the story tells of how Ŋgayam
flooded the rainforest and drowned an entire kin group as they stood gathering
his children – who had the form of fish – in his jungle streams. A version of this
story appears at the end of this grammar as Tayap Text 2.
Another telling instance of an ergative marker on an intransitive verb
occurred once when men from the neighboring village of Sanae arrived in
Gapun unannounced a few days after one of their relatives had been attacked
by a Gapuner. Everyone in Gapun was fearful of the Sanae men, because it was
assumed that they had come to fatally bewitch the attacker or one of his matrilineal relatives. As the Sanae men arrived in Gapun, villagers whispered to one
another:
(4-36) Merewŋgrogi ŋgwek
Merew -ŋgro =gi
ŋgwek
Sanae -pl
=erg.pl come.3pl.r
‘the Sanae [men] are coming’
The use of the ergative in this case meant that the Sanae men were not just dropping by Gapun on an innocent visit to socialize. They were coming to accomplish
a particular sinister purpose.
This use of the ergative to mark intentionality on intransitive verbs is also
apparent in cases where the ergative is used to denote a remarked-upon lack of
intentionality. The following example was uttered by a woman screaming abuse
at her relatives because her nephew littered the ground in front of her house with
seeds he blew from a homemade pea-shooter (i.e. in front of the house of the
woman having the “kros”, see Kulick 1992: 104–113 and Kulick 1993 for details on
these kinds of antagonistic speech events):

yum =ŋi
mburai
-ak
2pl =erg.m sweep.irr -link
‘you all never sweep!’aku

negHere the ergative clitic on an intransitive verb (mburai ‘sweep’) inflected in the
negative habitual aspect (see Section 8.3.2) highlights the consistent lack of
intention on the part of her addressees to perform an act that she thinks they
ought to consider doing occasionally.","[136, 137, 138]"
"Adverbs
up wodownstream ato81RAINFORESTupstream wuriMANGROVE LAGOON
down sireThe vertical axis refers to the spatial elevationals of ‘up’ and ‘down’, for
instance being up in a tree or down on the ground.
The horizontal axis refers to the geographical relationship between the rainforest and the mangrove lagoon. The mangrove lagoon that villagers have to cross
to get to the neighboring village of Wongan runs to the sea and lies to the north
of Gapun. The rainforest, in which the villagers live and into which they walk
every day to find sago palms to process and game to hunt, lies all around the
village, but most of the vast areas of their traditional land lies roughly south of
Gapun. In relation to the mighty Sepik River, which can be seen from the top of
the mountain where Gapun village was situated until after World War II, the mangrove lagoon is ‘downstream’, and the rainforest is ‘upstream’. This is the sense
in which villagers say they went ‘down’ to Wongan and then came back ‘up’ to
Gapun. These directionals are relative to one another, so that when one has gone
‘up’ into the rainforest, one comes ‘down’ to Gapun village when one returns.
Note that the terms also cover all space within the village.
The five other freestanding positionals are:
ari
ase
aro
ato
osi‘below’, in the sense of ‘down below’ on a slope
‘beside’, ‘on the edge of’, ‘on the periphery of’
‘inside’, in the sense of ‘enveloped in or covered by’

possessive-marked noun in (3-71a–c), to specify location. One of the tests I did for
positionals was to put a plastic box in the middle of my floor and then put a torch
(i.e. a flashlight) in various positions in, under, behind, etc. the box. Some of the
positionals I elicited in this way are as follows (Note: tos ‘torch’ and kontena ‘box’

Tayap has a single set of pronouns that occur in three different cases: absolutive,
ergative and possessive.
The possessive pronouns are formed by adding the possessive clitic = ŋa(n)
to the absolutive-case pronouns (with some irregularities), and the ergative pronouns are formed by adding the nominal ergative clitics (see Section 4.3) to the
absolutive forms, again with some irregularities. Note that bound pronominal
forms are listed below and discussed in Section 5.3.

"3.1.3.3 Non-particular nouns
Nouns that otherwise could be expected to be masculine can be feminine under
two circumstances.
The first is when the subject or referent of a verb is a general class of people
rather than a named or known individual. For example, the following utterance
is from a harangue by an older Tayap speaker who is chastising younger villagers for behaving badly. In the course of his harangue, the speaker wonders
rhetorically which big man (i.e. which old, knowledgeable man) is still alive to
teach young people about the good ways of the past. (The answer, he knows,
is ‘none’.)
His question was phrased as follows:
(3-22) Ani munje suman wuk?
who man
big
be.3sg.f.r
‘Which big man is here (i.e. still living)?’
Note that the verb ‘be’ is inflected in 3sg.f, even though the referent is unambiguously a male. The use of the feminine form here conveys generality. It refers to
the category or class of ‘big men’ rather than to a specific big man. If the speaker
had phrased the question using the 3sg.m form of ‘be’, kut, the question would
be referring to a specific named or known big man: ‘Which one of the big men we
all know is present here right now?’
Another example of the same phenomenon is the following (feminine forms
that denote the male referent are in bold):Nouns61(3-23) ŋgu munje ŋgo ŋgon pawrɨk tatukundre, nirkwanuk, noni namkru wákare

‘The man is of course finding his strength and doing it on his own,
nobody else is telling him to’
This utterance was spoken during a tense discussion about the incessant and disruptive drinking in the village that, by late 2009, had been plaguing Gapun for
some time. During a village-wide meeting, the mother of a fifteen-year-old boy
shouted angrily that her husband never tried to stop their son from drinking.
In response, a man in his late thirties made the comment above, which is
dismissive of the mother and supports the young man’s father by implying that
it wouldn’t matter what the father told his son. The son, this man is saying, is old
enough and would act according to his own desires anyway: no one is ordering
him to drink; he does it because he wants to. But as in the previous example,
(3-22), this utterance refers to a male using feminine grammatical forms.
The rhetorical effect is the same: the speaker’s use of feminine grammatical
forms when talking about a male conveys a meaning of generality. The speaker
is not overtly disputing anything the mother says about her son or her husband,
these grammatical forms say; he is making a general observation.
A non-literal but semantically more accurate translation of the man’s remark
would be: ‘As young men get older and stronger of course they decide on their own
what they want to do, they don’t do things just because other people tell them to’.
3.1.3.4 Gender in young people’s Tayap
Young speakers are aware that Tayap marks gender, and they know how to mark
it on verb stems, object suffixes, subject suffixes and through ergative markers.
A problem they have, though, is keeping straight the forms that mark masculine gender from the ones that mark feminine gender. This problem can be exemplified by a short extract from a narrative told by an eighteen-year-old woman.
This young woman is telling a story about a crocodile that she and some other
young women caught in the mangrove swamp. The women tied the 1.5 meter-long
crocodile’s jaws together, put it in a copra bag and brought it home. It lived for a
while, then, the speaker recounts, her father killed it (forms that express gender
are in bold):623 Word classes(3-24) orem aŋgi wuk embre sasŋi poŋgɨn

po
-ŋgɨ
-n
strike.r -3sg.m.r.o
-sg|1pl.s
‘the (female) crocodile was there, in the morning (male) father killed him’
All the words and morphemes that express gender are correctly formed. The masculine ergative case morpheme on ‘father’ is also the correct one. But note that
the grammatical gender of the crocodile here changes from feminine to masculine
in the course of a single utterance. Crocodiles are generally masculine in Tayap,
so the final verb here, poŋgɨn, is exactly what a fluent speaker would say. But the
deictic word used by this young speaker, aŋgi, as well as the first verb, wuk, are
semantically incorrect – they are the feminine forms, but what the speaker wants
are the masculine forms: ainde kut.
If the speaker had been talking about a female crocodile (for example if the
crocodile had been found to be carrying eggs), then the deictic aŋgi and the verb
wuk would have been correct. But in that case, the final verb should have had a feminine object morpheme – it should have been po-ku-n (kill.r-3sg.f.r.o-sg|1pl.s).
This kind of gender-mixing is characteristic of young speakers. Generally
speaking, the younger and less competent the speaker, the more gender will be
mixed in haphazard ways like this. As in many other areas of Tayap grammar, it
is clear that young speakers know that a particular distinction is expressed in the
vernacular. They are also capable of producing some of the forms that mark the
distinction. What they lack is the capacity to realize the distinction in a grammatically consistent manner.
In Young People’s Dyirbal, a situation of language death in Australia, weaker
speakers changed the semantic gender assignment system to a simple animacy/
gender system. That is, they kept the morphology and rearranged the class assignment system (Schmidt 1985). That is the opposite situation to what is happening
with Tayap: here, the assignment principles remain but what is changed is that
the morphological marking has become inconsistent.","[80, 81, 82]"

A number of words and suffixes in Tayap have no referential meaning. They function to draw attention to or emphasize the word they follow. So an angry shout
of ayáta! ‘enough!’ followed by the word kai expresses stronger disapproval than
ayáta without the kai.
A second group of words function as ways for speakers to do things like plan
discourse, stress particular constituents, hedge and change topics.
Tayap’s intensifiers and discourse markers are as followsIntensifiers and discourse markers1013.11.1 Intensifiers

ndɨdiscourse marker that draws attention to the noun phrase that precedes
it. It conveys the gentle nuance that whatever precedes it is known
or should be known by the addressee. Its meaning therefore extends
from what one might translate as ‘you know’, ‘right’ or ‘so’, to more
exasperated nuances like ‘in case you weren’t paying attention’ or ‘you
perhaps don’t know, but now I’m telling you’. An example expressing
impatience is as follows:(3-98) tukur non

When ndɨ occurs in a sentence that has at least one verb inflected in
the counterfactual mood, it also functions syntactically as a marker of
subordination (see Section 9.4.2).
ndadiscourse marker that is likely a reduced form of the deictic morpheme
ainda (see Section 3.8). Used like ndɨ to draw attention to the noun or noun
phrase that precedes it, and often carries a sense similar to English ‘then’:(3-100) mboka ŋa nda numbwan aproyi tatin

In a way that is similar to and probably related to the pragmatic function of
Tayap’s deictic words (see Section 3.8), discourse markers frequently occur multiple times in a single sentence, as in the following:

"1746 The formation of realis and irrealis verbsSo a class 2 verb like war ‘fill’ will be inflected as
(6-15) a. *war
-ku
fill.irr -3sg.f.r.o
‘I filled it’-n
-sg|1pl.r.sinstead of the correct form, which is:
b.par -ku
fill.r -3sg.f.r.o
‘I filled it’-n
-sg|1pl.r.sAn incorrect form like *warkun indicates that the speaker is using the verb root,
war, as the basis for inflection. All young people do this, and this kind of error
demonstrates a central feature of how young speakers produce Tayap verb morphology: they clearly perceive the morphological structure of verbs but they are
unable to produce them correctly.
The speaker who produced *warkun possibly had a sense that the verb she
wanted is associated with both the semivowel w and the plosive p. Having heard
parkun (‘I filled it’), warkrutak (‘she will fill it’, or ‘you (f) will fill it’) and warkru
wákare (‘X won’t fill it) all her life, the speaker who produced this utterance
probably intuitively knew the different forms that this verb can take. She has not
analyzed the different sounds as signifying different tenses and statuses, and so
what she ends up producing is a verb that mixes together realis and irrealis forms
and results in an ungrammatical neologism.
Young speakers who attempt to inflect class 1 or 2 verbs that they do not automatically know do one of three things:
The first thing they can do is illustrated by the above example: they include
both the irrealis and realis forms in the same verb. Other examples are *wurpukun
(instead of puwkun; from wuw ‘carry on shoulder’) and *woipokun (instead of
poikun; from woi ‘roll’).
The second strategy is to conjugate the class 1 or 2 verb as though it were a
class 5 verb. This means treating the verb root as though it is invariant, and also
using a discontinuous subject marker in the non-future. So a class 1 verb like
kotar-(p)-e ‘ask’ becomes *kotar and is inflected as:
(6-16) a. *kotar -tu -ku
-n
ask.irr -s <3sg.f.r.o> -2sg|3sg.f.r.s
‘she asked her’Transitive verb classes175instead of the correct form:
b. kotarpe -ku
ask.r
-3sg.f.r.o
‘she asked her’-n
-sg|1pl.r.sThe ungrammatical verb *kotar-tu-ku-n is a perfectly correctly formed class 5 verb
(see below, Section 6.1.7). The problem is that the verb in question, kotar-(p)-e-, is
a class 1 verb, not a class 5 verb.
At the same time, however, it is important to note that anyone hearing the
ungrammatical verb *kotar-tu-ku-n will have no trouble understanding its
meaning. The verb root kotar means ‘query’. It derives the noun ‘question’ (as
kotarŋgar) and the intransitive verb ‘ask’, kotarkɨ. Because this basic meaning of
the verb root is known to everyone, it does not make a great deal of difference for
comprehension if the verb is conjugated as a class 1 verb or as a class 5 verb.
This kind of separable relationship between the meaning of a verb root and the
details of its inflection will likely lead to the attrition of class 1 and 2 verbs. When
it doesn’t matter is if a verb is inflected as mbuspiŋgɨn (class 1, mbus-(p)-i ‘send’)
or mbustiŋgɨn (‘send’ inflected as a class 5 verb), the less regular inflection will
inexorably decline in use in the speech of young speakers who have not learned it.
At the same time as young speakers simplify Tayap verbal morphology in this
way – that is, treating verbs of other classes as though they were all class 5 verbs –
there is also a competing tendency to insert a p in verbs that do not take one. So
some young speakers produce forms like the following:
(6-17) a. *moserpi -ku
buy.r
-3sg.f.r.o
‘I bought it’-n
-sg|1pl.r.sinstead of
b. mose -nu -ku
-n
buy.r -s
<3sg.f.r.o> -1sg.m|3sg.m|1pl.r.s
‘I bought it’
verb root moser (class 4)
(6-18) a. *andpi
-ku
-n
follow.r <3sg.f.r.o> - sg|1pl.r.s
‘I followed her’
instead of1766 The formation of realis and irrealis verbsb. kandu
-ku
-n
follow.r <3sg.f.r.o> -1sg|2sg|3sg.m|1pl.r.s
‘I followed her’
verb root andu- (class 3)
Both (6-17a and 6-18a) are inflected as class 1 verbs in the non-future tense,
despite the fact that moser ‘buy’ is a class 4 verb and andu ‘follow’ is a class 3
verb. These cases exhibit the opposite of the tendency just discussed: instead of
collapsing class 1 and 2 verbs into class 5 verbs, verbs from other classes become
incorporated into class 1 and 2 verbs.
There may have always been some free variation in Tayap on this count. In
the speech of the oldest Tayap speakers, for example, I recorded two words for
the verb ‘sweep’; one mburai (class 5) and the other mburai-(p)-i (class 1). The
difference in non-future inflection between these two verbs is the element that
directly follows the stem: in the first verb that is n or t plus a vowel, in the second
verb it is a p.
So using the first verb, one would say that a woman mburaitukun her house;
using the second, one would say she mburaipikun.
When I asked if these two forms meant anything different the oldest speakers in
the village told me no, they were exact synonyms. And that they were both correct.
The co-existence of two different forms of the same verb suggests that there may
have always been some accepted variation in the classification of verbs as class 5 or
class 1 verbs. If this is the case, then it seems that some young speakers have honed
in on that variation and exploited it. They inflect verbs as class 1 verbs (i.e. inserting
a p in the non-future) much less frequently than they simply collapse all verbs into
class 5 verbs. But the fact that they can create class 1 verbs out of verb roots from
other classes shows, once again, that young speakers possess a broad repertoire of
grammatical competence in Tayap. What they lack is productive ability.
The third strategy that young speakers use when they are unsure of how to
conjugate a class 1 or 2 verb in the non-future is to inflect it in the progressive
aspect. This often makes little semantic sense. But as is discussed in Section
8.3.1, the progressive aspect is an “easy” inflectional form – all one needs to know
is three things: (1) the irrealis stem form of the verb; (2) the benefactive object
(which in most cases will be -kwan ‘3sg.f.ben.r.o’); and (3) the correct form of the
verb ‘be’. This relative morphological transparency appeals to younger speakers
and allows them to use verbs they otherwise would have a hard time inflecting.
Thus, rather than tackling the class 2 verb war ‘grate’, to generate the correct
non-future form parkun ‘I grated it’, or the class 1 verb o ‘shoot’, to generate the
correct non-future form pokun ‘I shot it’, young speakers telling stories about
their actions and adventures say things like the following:Transitive verb classes177(6-19) a. war
-kwan
-kuk
grate.irr -3sg.f.ben.r.o -be.1sg.f.r.s
‘I (f) was grating it’
b. o
-kwan
-kut
strike.irr -3sg.f.ben.r.o - be.sg.m.r.s
‘I (m) was shooting it’
These are perfectly formed progressives. However, the context in which they
occurred demanded the non-future tense. But by inflecting the verbs in the progressive aspect, the speakers who needed them were at least able to use them.
This phenomenon illustrates a general rule of grammatical decay in Tayap,
namely: the weaker the speaker, the more instances of the progressive aspect that
speaker will use (see also Section 8.3.1).","[193, 194, 195, 196, 197]"
"Villagers’ debates and language shift343In some cases – for example, two different verbs that mean ‘sweep’: mburai
(class 5) and mburai-(p)-i (class 1) – the words are true synonyms (although in this
case, it is clear that the verb is mburai; in the class 1 form it is constructed with i- ‘give’).
In other cases, the difference in the meaning of two words may have been lost.
I suspect, for example, that the two words for ‘bridge’, koŋgrik and nɨmɨrkokɨr,
at one time referred to different kinds of bridges – made of different material,
spanning different bodies of water or constructed in different ways. However, I
was unable to elicit any difference in meaning from the most senior speakers in
the village. Whatever difference may have existed is now forgotten.","[362, 363]"

A relative clause is a clause which modifies a noun phrase, which “delimits the
reference of an NP by specifying the role of the referent of that NP in the situation
described by the [relative clause]” (Andrews 2007: 206). Relative clauses in Tayap
are nominalized, marked with the inanimate possessive clitic =ŋa(n) which
appears on the verb of the relative clause. This possessive clitic =ŋa(n) is added
to a fully inflected verb, which then functions as a subordinate relative clause.
The common argument or head (“domain nominal” in Andrews’ 2007 terms) of
a relative and a main clause can be in S, A, O or oblique function in the relative
clause and in the main clause.
Tayap relative clauses are external. The relative clause generally directly
follows the common argument in the main clause. This is the position held by a
nominal modifier (e.g. adjective) as well (see Chapter 4).
The common argument may also be expressed with a deictic (Section 3.8)
functioning resumptively with respect to the head noun, and typically following
the common argument directly: for example, consider (9-29a-b). In both examples
there are two resumptive pronouns, in (9-29a) following the relative clause and as
the final part of the main clause and in (9-29b) following the common argument
and as the final part of the main clause. Note that these resumptive pronouns agree
in gender and number with the common argument. They are not an obligatory part
of relative clauses: see for example (9-29c) and (9-29f), which do not have them.
Note that the verb of the relative clause is fully inflected, and the relative
clause contains all the usual components of a clause. The relative clause mayRelative clauses269even contain a complex predicate: see for example (9-29f) which has a relative
clause with a serial verb construction involving kv ‘bring’ in construction with a
verb (see Section 8.2.3.1).
Relative clauses would appear to always be restrictive. No non-restrictive relative clauses have been found in the data. In the following example the possessive marker is in bold and the head noun in the main clause underlined.

Relative clauses are not very common and the corpus contains few examples to
show whether the common argument is syntactically a part of the relative clause
or part of the main clause. However the main clause of (9-29d) can be negated
using wákare before munje (and changing the verb kiraw to kirawŋgrɨ). This suggests that munje belongs syntactically in the relative clause rather than the main
clause. However more examples are needed to be certain.
Tayap used to have another relativizing suffix: the morpheme -gin (or perhaps
it was a clitic =gin, there is not enough evidence to show). This morpheme seems
to be synonymous with, and occurs in exactly the same morphological slot as,
=ŋa(n). For example:

‘the house there that my father built has collapsed’
The morpheme appears both in naturally occurring talk and in elicitation sessions that I recorded in the 1980s. By 2009, however, it was no longer used by
anybody. 49.6 Finite nominalizations with consequence clitic =ŋa(n)
Finite nominalizations are constructed, like relative clauses, with the possessive
clitic, and carry the meaning of consequence; that a particular state has been
brought into existence because of an action. For example:
(9-31)kokɨr mbɨdtia ŋaŋan noŋor kokɨr kratianŋa

‘my head hurts because my wife hit me on the head’9.7 Perception constructions
Sentences that describe an act of perceiving, like seeing or smelling, can be
expressed in two ways in Tayap: either paratactically as two separate clauses, or
with a nominalized construction.
In the perception construction, the perceiver is subject of the main clause,
and the person or thing perceived is object. In the subordinate (nominalized)
clause, always placed after the main clause, the action expressing the circumstances of the perception is indicated. Coreferential with the main clause object
is the thing perceived, which may be subject or object in the subordinate clause.
The two possibilities are exemplified below:4 This is a reduced form of mbɨd-t-iata-n (pain.R-S<1SG.BEN.O.R>2SG|3SG.F.R.S). See the note
that directly follows example (7-29) in Chapter 7.","[287, 288, 289, 290, 291]"
"Orthography452.8 Orthography
The Tayap orthography in this grammar and dictionary uses letters of the English
alphabet that correspond to the language’s phonemes, with two exceptions: ɨ
and ŋ. The phonemes /ɵ/ and /ŋ/ would be difficult to render using the letters
used to write English or Tok Pisin. Tayap is almost never written, and any villager
who does so invents his or her own nonce orthography. In my years of contact with
the villagers, I have received many letters from them, always written in Tok Pisin.
At the very end of these letters, though, after the writer has finished asking me for
money (which is always the sole reason for sending me a letter), he or she often
concludes with a line written in Tayap, to add coercive punch to the requests.
A typical example is the phrase Aowo grag engon yu na na, which occurred at
the very end of a letter that had just instructed me to send the writer the equivalent of $8,000 (at a time when the yearly income for the entire village was about
$500). The interjection aowo is an orthographic rendering of a sound used by
villagers to convey worry and longing, and the rest, ‘good evening to you’, is a
Tayap calque of Tok Pisin’s “gutpela apinun long yu”. The unambiguous meaning
of the Tayap phrase is: ‘I worry about you, so now you worry about me and send
me eight thousand dollars’.
The orthography that villagers have come up with to write Tayap varies from
writer to writer and from occasion to occasion. However, one convention that has
developed over the years regards /ɵ/, which is sometimes written as h, and /ŋ/,
which is often rendered as either nh or ngh. This convention may be the invention
of Amburi Waiki, who was in his late twenties and the village prayer leader in the
mid-1980s. Amburi was the only person in Gapun to write anything in Tayap at
that time, and his orthography – which he himself applied erratically – was seen
by others and perhaps adopted by them. (What Amburi wrote on loose pages and
in school workbooks were the names of villagers who had contributed money to
the village church, and the names of areas of rainforest that he wanted to note
down for various reasons.)
This way of handling Tayap’s phonemes results in a sentence like the following, which Amburi wrote down for me in the 1980s: Ngha nghing ana mbet (‘I have
come for them’).
The problem with the orthography used to write this sentence is that it is
difficult for villagers to parse and read. It makes no distinction between free and
bound morphemes (-ana, ‘for’ or ‘to’, for example, is a bound morpheme that
cannot occur on its own), and literate villagers, who have learned to read by being
drilled in school with texts in English, have difficulty with the sheer number of
letters used to denote simple sounds. (In the orthography used in this grammar
and dictionary the sentence would be written Ŋa ŋgɨnana mbet.)462 Phonology and orthographyA sentence produced in 2009 by a literate villager who I asked to demonstrate
to me how he would write something in Tayap shows that the same problems
have persisted: Nhang nhan patir engon nhayar (‘My house is very nice’). The
orthography is internally inconsistent – the word written engon is pronounced
[εŋgɔn], and thus should be written enhgon, if the conventions of this orthography were followed consistently.
This orthography also quickly gets messy. For example, in the sentence just
quoted, a common word like ŋaŋan (‘my’) is written as two words and spelled
nhang nhan. In other instances, simple pronouns like ŋɨ [ŋɵ] (‘he’) and ŋgɨ [ŋgɵ]
(‘they’) tend to stump village writers, who might write them as nghi and nghgh,
respectively – although they would more likely avoid writing them or give up
trying to write them.
Words with the consonant cluster /ŋg/ also pose difficulties. A name like
‘Saŋgi’ – which the villagers’ orthography should render as something like
Sanhgi – looks strange to the villagers when they see it written out in this way
(they would in this case write ‘Sangi’). Worse, a name like ‘Saŋgiŋgi’, which
might be written something like Sanhginhgi, would make villagers who try to use
their invented orthography throw up their hands in despair.
Because of those difficulties, which villagers perceive and talk about themselves, I do not adopt their orthographic inventions to write /ɵ/ and /ŋ/. Instead, I
introduce two additional letters, ɨ and ŋ. These letters are ordered so that ɨ follows
i in the alphabet, and ŋ follows n.
While I depart from the villagers’ attempts to write /ɵ/ and /ŋ/, I do follow
their loose convention of orthographically marking prenasalization on the voiced
word-initial stops /b/ and /d/ and on the affricate /dʒ/. Villagers vary on whether
or not they orthographically mark word-initial nasalization on the velar stop
/g/: a word like ‘cassowary’, spelled ŋgat in this orthography, would probably be
written ngat by most villagers.
On the other hand, though, some of them write ŋgrag ‘evening’ as grag (see
above, the example of a villager’s letter asking me for $8,000). Regardless of how
they would write a word-initial /g/, however, Tayap speakers consistently prenasalize the phoneme when they pronounce it in this position. Hence, I mark this
in the orthography.
This concession to village pronunciation and writing conventions means that
the orthography used here is not as economical as it otherwise might have been.
I could have omitted the nasalization in words beginning with /b/, /d/, /j/ and
/g/ and simply noted that those phonemes are all obligatorily nasalized wordinitially (this is what Christopher Stroud and I did in our 1993 sketch grammar).
In the end, though, I decided that since the only people who might conceivably ever actually use the orthography employed here are the speakers of Tayap,Orthography47their perceptual biases and already-established habits were more important than
an economical orthography. As I just noted, villagers who write anything in Tayap
vary in whether or not they mark the prenasalization before a word-initial /g/. But
they would find it counter-intuitive and odd to see or write bor ‘pig’, je ‘dog’ or der
‘path’ when they say – and would write – mbor, nje and nder.
I therefore write words the way the villagers pronounce them, with the result
that there are no words in the dictionary that begin orthographically with b, d, j
or g.
Word-medial and word-final prenasalized consonants are written as they are
most commonly pronounced, thus the j in munje ‘man’ is written as prenasalized,
as it is normally pronounced, versus mbubujiram ‘bubbles from fish, crocodiles,
turtles emerging from underwater’, which is written unprenasalized.
This orthographic convention would also logically entail changing the spelling of the villagers’ home, Gapun, to Ŋgapun. However, ‘Gapun’ is not a Tayap
word. Senior men in the 1980s told me that they had heard that Germans had
given the name Gapun to their village – which is called Tayap num ‘Tayap village’
in Tayap.
No one knows why ‘Gapun’ was chosen, but the most likely explanation is
that when German cartographers and labor recruiters first appeared in the lower
Sepik area in the early decades of the 1900s, they asked coastal villagers the
names of inland villages which they could not reach, and they wrote down some
version of the names they received in response. The Kopar-language name for
Gapun, for example, is Saŋgap.
No great leap of imagination is required to see how a name like that, through
various mis-hearings and confusions, could end up as Gapun. A significant percentage of the colonial records from the lower Sepik area were destroyed during
WWII, so I have been unable to uncover any information that directly sheds light
on the question of why Gapun is called Gapun.
But whatever the story behind the German naming of the village may be, the
spelling of ‘Gapun’ can remain unchanged, since it is not a Tayap word.
Note that stress is marked where it is a property of a lexical morpheme (for
example, wákare (‘no’), but in the rest of the grammar it is not marked it when it
is a product of complex morpho-phonemics e.g. like kakúndara in (2-14a) above.
Out of respect for villagers’ writing habits (and also to be consistent with the
analysis of the language’s phonology discussed above, where no VVV clusters
are permitted), I have also changed the spelling of the name of the language and
people from Taiap – as I have spelled it in all my previous work on Gapun – to
Tayap.
Whenever villagers write their name for themselves, they always spell it
Tayap. And the word is a popular one to write. The front of one house near the482 Phonology and orthographycenter of the village, for example, is adorned with large letters, painted in black
battery acid, that proclaims (tellingly, in Tok Pisin), NIU LUK TAYAP (‘New Look
Tayap’).
Another young man, upping the linguistic ante in the direction of what many
villagers have understood is the even more prestigious language, used similar
material to paint the words NEW HOME TAYAP on a wall in his house.
A young man with whom I was walking along the beach one day, making
the six-hour trip to the village of Watam to see if the local health worker there
had any medicine for a bad case of scabies I had acquired in the village (she
didn’t), paused at one point to scratch the words NICK OUTCAST PERSON K*B*H*
ROR TAYAP MUNJE into the sand. Translated, this means ‘Nick outcast person
K[ambedagam] B[lue] H[ill] child Tayap man’ – the K*B*H* part of the message
being a name the young villagers have given to their mountain.
Nick’s scribble in the sand doesn’t make much sense in either of the two languages in which it is written. But that is typical of the way that the word Tayap is
used in young villagers’ writing: it is used more as a marker or a tag than as an
attempt to convey referential meaning. Nick’s writing is a slightly more elaborate
variant of the words Tayap ror (Tayap child), which is a popular tag that young
men and women like to carve into trees or add after their signature at the end of
a love letter. The words are modeled on the Tok Pisin word “mangi”, which used
to mean ‘child’, but which during the past thirty years has acquired the sassier
meaning of ‘young person’ or, better, ‘kid’.","[64, 65, 66, 67, 68]"
"340Tayap-English-Tok Pisin DictionaryThe form of the verb stem that appears in negation is also the form that
constitutes the basis of all non-realis status and mood inflections; for example,
ir-kɨ-ndak ‘laugh.irr-irr-3pl.irr’ [they will laugh], and ir-ŋgarana ‘laugh.
irr-nd’ [X (any subject) better not laugh].
(2) The forms in the parentheses following the entry are the verb’s realis forms.
If the forms are regular, only a few will be listed, in order to allow a reader
to identify them by looking at Sections 6.2.1 and 6.2.2 of the Grammar. In the
case of ‘laugh’, a glance at Section 6.2.1 reveals that the endings -ot and -ok
indicate that ‘laugh’ is a Group IV intransitive verb, and that pirot means ‘I
(m) laughed’, ‘you (m) laughed’, or ‘he laughed’; pirok means ‘I (f) laughed’,
‘you (f) laughed’, ‘she laughed’ or ’we laughed’. The forms that verbs that
belong to this Group take for all other persons are found in that Section.
If the intransitive verb is irregular in realis, the irregular forms will be listed in the
parentheses following the entry.
Another example of an entry for an intransitive verb, this time for one whose
stem form does not change between realis and irrealis, is ‘say’, ‘talk’. The entry
for this verb looks like this:
namkɨ v.i. (-net/-nak), say, talk; tok.
This entry should be read to mean the following:
(1) The irrealis form of this intransitive verb is namkɨ, consisting of the verb
stem nam + the irrealis suffix -kɨ. This is the form the verb takes when it is
negated – so one says namkɨ wákare ‘X (any subject) didn’t/won’t talk’.
Once again, the irrealis suffix -kɨ is a morpheme separate from the verb
stem, but it is provided in the dictionary entry because there is no way of
knowing what the suffix is unless one sees it here.
The form of the verb stem that appears under negation is also the
form that constitutes the basis of all non-realis status and mood inflections; for example, nam-kɨ-ndak ‘talk.irr-irr-3pl.irr’ [they will talk], and
nam-ŋg rana ‘talk.irr-nd’ [X (any subject) better not talk].
(2) In those cases where all that follows an entry for an intransitive verb is
parentheses with endings like (-net/-nak), this means that the verb stem
remains the same between realis and irrealis. The realis person-endings of
these verbs can be reckoned through the following steps:
(a) remove the irrealis suffix -ki, -kɨ or -ku (in the case of ‘say’ or ’talk’, it is
-kɨ). This leaves only the verb stem (nam);
(b) suffix the appropriate subject endings to that stem.","[359, 360]"

gender agreement. Some examples (common nouns in bold):

‘Fucking black-holed Erapo!’3.1.1.2 Locational nouns
Some place names, particularly names of places in the rainforest, function as
bare adjuncts, whereas all other nouns must take a peripheral case clitic, either
locative, ablative or perlative. Some examples of locational nouns are as follows:
(3-7) Kandumsik ndow -kru

ainda mbek
Kandumsik leg

‘I’m coming to Kandumsik [stream] (to put my legs in the water)’
Note: in this example, the noun ‘leg’ is functioning as a transitive verb
(see also example (3-26).","[69, 70]"
"Transitive verb classes167Like class 4 verbs, class 5 verbs are inflected in the non-future tense with
discontinuous subject morphemes. Together these mark the subject of a verb. An
example of a class 5 transitive verb is ep ‘return’ or ‘give back’:

All transitive verbs can be assigned to one of the five verb conjugation classes
based on:
(a) the pattern of alternation that occurs between the realis and irrealis verb stems;
(b) the phonetic shape of the verb stem in its realis forms.
What makes this system difficult for young speakers of the language is that there
is little predictability about which verbs fall into which conjugation classes. For
example, most verb stems that begin with a are class 3 verbs. However, some, like
and-(p)-o ‘awaken’, and amai-(p)-i ‘search for’ are not (they are both class 1 verbs).
Another example: it is impossible to know, if one only hears the non-future form
of a verb like parkun ‘I filled it up’, whether the verb is a class 1 verb (in which case1686 The formation of realis and irrealis verbsthe stem would be ar), a class 2 verb (in which case the stem would be war) or a class
5 verb, in which case the stem would be par. (It turns out that ‘fill up’ is a class 2 verb.)
A similar problem presents itself with a verb like ‘let go’, ‘release’. Even if one
knows that a future form of this verb is orekrutak, ‘she will release it’ (or ‘you (f) will
release it’), one can only guess as to whether its non-future form will be porekun
(class 1) or oretukun (class 5), both of which are entirely possible – but both of which
are wrong. It turns out that the verb is a class 1 verb, but the expected p appears after
the e, rather than before the o, thus rendering orepekun (‘she released it’).
What follows below is detailed discussion of the five classes for transitive verbs.","[186, 187, 188]"

the formally identical progressive marker also -rɨk (see Section 8.3.1.1).
The counterfactual affix -rɨk is optional in those cases where the form of
the verb stem in the counterfactual differs from its form in the irrealis. So, for
example, a verb like ‘be’ is realized as a in its irrealis form, but in the counterfactual, it becomes awk. This partially suppletive stem change makes the counterfactual morpheme -rɨk redundant. Therefore, it can be omitted. But it doesn’t
have to be omitted.
The phrase ‘she would have been’ can thus be expressed in any of the following four ways:
awk-rɨk-rak
awk-rɨk-tak
awk-rak
awk-tak
Transitive verbs display a similar range of variation. They can be formed in ways
that either include or exclude the following morphemes in parentheses. Note the
realis forms of the subject and object affixes:Adverbial subordinate clauses267+ object.r +

(see Section

speakers insist mean the same:2

akrɨkkun
aknukun
akkunAs with intransitive verbs, all these options for variation only apply to verbs that
alter their stems in the counterfactual. They don’t apply to a verb like moser
‘buy’, for example, because that verb has the same stem form in both the irrealis
and the counterfactual (since moser isn’t a class 1, 2 or 3 verb; see the discussion
above about which verbs change their stem form in the counterfactual).3 In this
case, where the stem does not change to express the counterfactual, the counterfactual morpheme -rɨk is needed – even if the -nv/-tv subject morphemes are
optional.
So the full range of inflectional options listed above applies to verbs like o
‘hit’ or wawar-(p/w)-e ‘hang up’, because to express counterfactuality, those verb
stems change and become wak and wawarwek respectively. In those instances,
once again, the counterfactual affix -rɨk is redundant, since the stem change
already signals counterfactuality.
Negative counterfactual actions are expressed by simply negating the relevant subordinate verb as in a main clause, and following this with one of the
hypothetical particles (most commonly ndɨ), then expressing the main clause in
the counterfactual as usual:2 In the morphological combination -rɨknukun, the morpheme-medial n and u undergo metathesis, resulting in [ɾɵkunkun]
3 To lessen the risk for confusion, the verb stem of such verbs is glossed as cf in counterfactual
constructions, even though the stem is identical with its irr form. An example is (9-23).","[285, 286, 287]"
"Perception constructions273One argument, the subject or the object of the main clause, is coreferent with
either the subject or object of the nominalized clause. The verb of the nominalized clause is fully inflected. These clauses, while marked with the possessive
clitic (as relative clauses are), are structurally different from relative clauses.
Relative clauses modify NPs, and they occur in the modifier slot within an NP.
These nominalized clauses, on the contrary, while they share an argument with
their main clause, do not modify an NP but rather modify an entire main clause,
within the specific semantic domain of perception. The shared argument of the
clauses is expressed only once, in the main clause, while the nominalized clause
consists only of the nominalized predicate and any arguments.
These are not complement clauses either, as the nominalized clause does not
function as an argument of the main clause, but rather as a modifier. This can
clearly be seen for example in (9-32b), in which it can’t be the case that the nominalized clause is functioning as an argument of the main clause. The main clause
verb has 3pl object marking, so the object must be the women, not the clause
describing them going into the forest.
Other potential candidates for complement clauses, including constructions
of saying and telling, are expressed with verbal morphology involving indirect
commands (see Section 7.1.4).

predicates what is perceived.","[292, 293]"

"Adjectives follow their head noun. Some examples:
(3-36) munje
kemem
man
long
‘tall man’
(3-37) noŋor
kɨtɨŋɨn
woman short
‘short woman’
(3-38) orak
apro
thing
bad
‘bad thing’
(3-39) arawer mɨk
sun
sharp
‘hot sun’ (lit. ‘sharp sun’)
Adjectives can function predicatively as well as attributively, although this is less
common than in a language like English, because adjectives, like nouns, can
become verbs (see below, Section 3.3.2). So rather than saying something like “the
sun is hot” – which can be said, as arawer mɨk (lit. ‘sun sharp’), as in (3-39) – speakers of Tayap more readily say arawer mɨknet (lit. ‘sun sharpens’, i.e. ‘sun is hot’).
Examples of adjectives occurring predicatively are as follows:

when the head noun is understood:
(3-41) sawir aŋgo wuk

be.3sg.f.r
‘this black (one) is there’3.3.1 Number inflection in adjectives
Adjectives can take a plural suffix, as discussed in Section 3.6.2, but they can also
inflect for number using partial suppletion. Like nouns, which but for a handful
of exceptions do not inflect for number, the overwhelming majority of adjectives
have only one form, and they do not change for number or gender. There are four
exceptions to this.
Only two adjectives are inflected with partially suppletive forms in the singular, dual and plural: ‘little’ and ‘old’. The dual and plural forms are used only
for animate referents – so one says rorsem moprɨ (children little-dl, ‘two little
children’), but patɨr mokop sene (house little-sg two, ‘two little houses’).
The dual and plural forms recorded here are moribund: they were given to me
in the 1980s by senior men who have since died. Today, only the oldest speakers
are able to produce them:
(3-42) a. ‘little’
sg
mokop
dl
moprɨ
pl
moprob. ‘old’
sg
kowot
dl
kotiw
pl
kotoIn addition to ‘little’ and ‘old’, two adjectives meaning ‘young’ have singular and
plural forms, but lack a dual form:
(3-43) a. ‘young’ (used for both
males and females)
sg eiwɨr
pl eiwɨrob. ‘young’ (traditionally used only for
females; nowadays used for both sexes)

pl mambro703 Word classes3.3.2 Verbalized adjectives
Like nouns, all adjectives can be zero-derived as intransitive verbs by directly suffixing them with morphemes that encode realis/irealis status, subject and other
verbal categories. The verbs derived in this way are generally inchoatives; they
express a change of state:
(3-44) a. ŋgu kararkɨtak

‘the sun is getting yellow and will soon be gone (i.e. it will set)’
e. numbwan aprotak
numbwan apro -tak
thought
bad -2sg.f|3sg.f.r
‘the thought became bad’
Similarly, in the following example, the adjective ‘big’ functions as a medial verb
with a medial manner suffix -kar (Section 9.8.2):
(3-45) ŋgomar pɨtkwanŋgukre awin sumankar puwok
ŋgomar pɨt
-kwan
-ŋguk

puwok
water big
-mann ascend.sg.f.r
‘While they were washing the fish, the water continued to rise’ (lit.
‘became big rising)
Numerals, which are also adjectives, can likewise be verbalized in this way:
(3-46) yim imin nambartak
yim imin nambar -tak
1pl belly one
-2sg .f|3sg.f.r
‘We’ve agreed’ (lit. ‘our bellies have become one’)
Note, however, that adjectives inflected as progressives express a state, not a
change of state:
(3-47) yum moprokukemre, yumŋi kirawkru wákare
yum mopro
-kukem
-re
yum =ŋi

‘you were all small (i.e. you were all children) then, so you don’t know’3.3.3 Verbs as nominal modifiers
Verbs can function as nominal modifiers, using the non-finite suffix –(ŋ)gar (see
Section 4.2). For example:
(3-48) prukŋgar noŋor
pruk -ŋgar noŋor

Tayap has many closed classes of adverbs: common, -kɨ, temporal, frequency/
distributional or ‘not yet’, and elevational/positional adverbs. They will each be
described below.
3.4.1 Common adverbs
Tayap has a small closed set of common adverbs that specify the way in which the
action expressed by the verb is carried out. The full set is as follows:

aike
areinɨ
ariuta

‘for no reason’
‘directly’, ‘straight’Adverbssupwáspwa
tandiw‘badly’
‘well’tawaŋgenɨ
wákarerekɨ73‘ignorantly’, ‘unknowingly’
‘yet’Adverbs are normally placed before their head verb. Note that two adverbs can
cooccur as in (3-53 f):
(3-53) a. yumŋi supwáspwa ninkurem
yum =ŋi
supwáspwa ni
-n -ku
-rem
2pl =erg.m badly

‘you all did it badly’
b. Aŋges katkat prukakkut

‘stop dawdling, go a little more quickly!’ (said to a male)
g. Mbasamama patɨrnɨ urok, rɨt ŋayarnɨ urok
Mbasama =ma patɨr =nɨ urok,
rɨt
Mbasama =poss house =all go_inside.3sg.f|1pl.r without pausing743 Word classesŋayar -nɨ
urok
really -intens go_inside.3sg.f|1pl.r
‘she went inside Mbasama’s house, she went inside without pausing’
h. kukununumwetet!
ku
-ku
nunum we
-tet!
bring -3sg.f.r.o running come.sbj -2sg.m.r
‘bring it running!’ (i.e. bring it right this minute, fast)
Note also that (3-53h) has an adverb occurring between the verbs of a serial verb
construction.
Like adjectives, common adverbs can function as verbs (Section 3.3.2). So just
as it is possible to inflect an adjective to say something like ‘it will be bad’,
(3-54) aprorkɨtak
apro -r- -kɨ
-tak
bad -r- -irr -2sg.f|3sg.f.irr
‘it will get bad’ (The r after apro here and after supwáspwa in the next
example is phonologically motivated; see Section 2.6.)
Adverbs can also be inflected to produce sentences like the following:
(3-55) a. supwáspwarkɨtak
supwáspwa -r- -kɨ
-tak
badly
-r- -irr -2sg.f|3sg.f.irr
‘it will go badly’
b. ŋayartakara
ŋayar -tak
-ara
really -2sg.f|3sg.f.r -perf
‘it became the real thing’
In addition to modifying verbs, adverbs can also modify noun phrases, as in the
following, in which ŋayor ‘really’ modifies the possessive NP ‘illness’:
(3-56) kandawŋan munje ŋayor
kandaw =ŋan munje ŋayor
illness =poss man
really
‘a really sick man’Adverbs753.4.2 Adverbial functions of the suffix -kɨ
The affix -kɨ (rarely -nɨ) has multiple functions. It is one of the three irrealis affixes
for intransitive verbs (see Section 5.4.2). It is also an intensifier (see Section 3.11).
In addition, it expresses adverbial meanings when it is affixed to the following
components:
(1) -kɨ can be affixed to nouns to express a distributive meaning; that is, that an
action or event takes place on more than one individual occasion, involves an
undetermined variety of the same kind of referents, or denotes the way in which
something is distributed. These are usually reduplicated:
(3-57) a. orom -kɨ
orom -kɨ
time -adv time -adv
‘every now and again’
b. munje -kɨ
munje -kɨ
man
-adv man
-adv
‘different men’, ‘a variety of men’
c. menjikan -kɨ
menjikan -kɨ
nearby
-adv nearby
-adv
‘frequently’, ‘constantly’ (cf. Tok Pisin’s “klostu klostu”)
d. ambagaikɨ ambagaikɨ aku wákare ainɨ

e. senekɨ senekɨ isimbatan
sene -kɨ
sene -kɨ
isi
-mbata
-n
two -adv two -adv give.sbj -3pl.ben.r.o -sg|1pl.r
‘give them two each’
(2) -kɨ can be suffixed to adjectives, to convey the meaning of ‘still’:
(3-58) a. ror mokop kararkɨ ŋgu sisiek awinnɨ tuwŋgwar patɨrekenɨ
ror
mokop karar -kɨ ŋgu sisiek
awin =nɨ
child small red -adv 3sg.f descend.2sg.f|3sg.f.r water =loc

‘the baby was still red (i.e. newborn) when she came down from (i.e.
left) the maternity house’763 Word classesb. orak irokɨ mbatatukun

-kɨ
mbata -tu -ku
-n
thing new -adv ruin.r - s <3sg.f.r.o> -2sg|3sg.f.r.s
‘the thing was still new and you buggered it up’
(3) -kɨ can be suffixed to a verb, making that verb function as what in English
would be a gerund. The form of this construction is as follows:
TRANSITIVE VERBS
INTRANSITIVE VERBSirr verb stem + realis or ben object morpheme + -kɨ
irr verb stem + -kɨExamples:
(3-59) a. ŋaŋan nam tariakɨ, ŋgɨ Merewre ŋgwok

Wongan =all
‘Having turned the ladder, Mbowdi went down to Wongan’
(‘Ladders’ are notched poles leading up into a house, and they get
turned when people leave their houses so that the notches face
inwards. This makes it more difficult for dogs to climb up into a
house.)
c. ketukrakɨ, munje kowot ide orepeyin

Tayap has several types of temporals, which function adverbially, and which
express when an event occurred or will occur:AdverbsGeneral temporals:anombi
nunuk
nirere
rɨpam
rɨpɨm
rɨpɨmkɨ
rɨpɨmbarakɨ‘later on in the near future’
‘later’, ‘afterwards’
‘a moment ago’, ‘in a minute’
‘a long time previously’, ‘in the olden days’
‘before’, ‘previously’
‘quite a while ago’
‘a fair while ago’ (not as long ago as rɨpɨmkɨ)Divisions of the day:embeb
emb
arawer
ŋgrag arawer
ŋgrag
ikur‘just before dawn’ (4.30–5.30)
‘morning’ (5.30–7.00)
‘daytime, early afternoon’ (7.00–16.00)
‘late afternoon’ (16.00–17.00)
‘early evening’ (17.00–19.00)
‘night’ (19.00–4.30)77The locative clitic =re can be used in its temporal function with these words to
specify the time of an action:
(3-60) a. ikurre yim okɨtike
ikur
=re
yim o
-kɨ
-tike
night =temp 1pl go.irr -irr -dl.irr
‘the two of us will go at night’
b. embre kɨ ŋgwokara mɨrinɨ
emb

kɨ
ŋgwok
-ara
mɨri

morning =temp intens go.3pl.r -perf rainforest =all
‘they went into the jungle at the break of dawn’
=re also carries the adverbial meaning of frequency when the temporal phrase it
creates is repeated. See below, Section 3.4.4.
Calendrical time has the following nominal expressions:
aro
arawer
karep
ŋgudumŋa kɨt/
mbiruŋa kɨt‘day’
‘day’, lit. ‘sun’
‘month’, lit. ‘moon’
‘year’, lit. ‘Pleiades’=re is also attached to these words to specify the time of an action:783 Word classes(3-61)nunukŋa karepre oŋgrɨnetana okɨ
nunuk =ŋa
karep =re

-3sg.m.irr.o-net
-ana
o
-kɨ
-1sg.m|3sg.m.irr.s -intent go.irr -irr
‘next month I’m going to go hit him’
Duration over time – ‘for three days’ and similar – is expressed by adding an
intransitive verb ending, inflected for 3sg.f, to the number:
(3-62)ŋgɨ turkar ŋgwoka arawer senetak
ŋgɨ tur
-kar
ŋgwok
-a
arawer sene-tak
3pl sing_and_dance -mann go.3pl.r -and day
two-2sg|3sg.f.r
‘they sang and danced for two days’Days in relation to one another are expressed as:
muŋgit‘the day before yesterday’ (used generally to mean ‘recently’, ‘in
the recent past’)
ewar
‘yesterday’
ene
‘today’, ‘now’
epi
‘tomorrow’
tuemb
‘the day after tomorrow’
amen
‘3 days hence’
amamar
‘4 days hence’
amandukup ‘5 days hence’
ndukup
‘6 days hence’
aŋgisakup ‘7 days hence’
The above temporals differ from the others listed so far in that unlike them, the
words for days in relation to one another are never modified by the postposed
temporal -re.
Some examples of use are:
(3-63)a. muŋgit yim priekŋan ŋgɨ Ŋgasimbara patɨrnɨ ŋguk
muŋgit yim priek
=ŋan, ŋgɨ Ŋgasimbara
recently 1pl come_up.1sg.f|1pl.r =poss 3pl NgasimbaraAdverbs79patɨr =nɨ
ŋguk

‘recently, when we arrived Ŋgasimbara, they were in the house [there]’
b. ewar ikurre ŋa mbot sasik amaikrunana
ewar

amai
-kru
-nana
search_for.irr -3sg.f.irr.o -intent
‘last night I went to hunt (lit. ‘to look for’) bandicoot’
Speakers younger than about forty know the words in the above list of days up to
and including tuemb ‘the day after tomorrow’. Some know, but never use, amen
(three days from now). The words for four and five days in the future are known
only by speakers over fifty. I recorded aŋgisakup (seven days from now) during
elicitation sessions with old fluent speakers in the 1980s. Nowadays the word is
obsolete, remembered by only a few of the oldest speakers in the village.","[88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99]"
"663 Word classesexpressed by a verb stem inflected as counterfactual and suffixed by object and
subject morphemes that occur in their realis forms, rather than in their irrealis
forms, which in the case below would be -kru- (3sg.f.irr.o) and -net (for 1sg.m.s;
for the appropriate endings for other subjects, see Section 5.3):
(3-34) wakrɨkkun
wak
-rɨk -ku
-n
strike.cf -cf -3sg.f.r.o - sg|1pl.r.s
‘I (m or f)/you/he/she/we would have shot it’
For intransitive verbs, the counterfactual is expressed by a verb stem inflected
as counterfactual and suffixed by group I subject morphemes, which in this
grammar – for the sake of consistency with the pattern that is clear in transitive
verbs – are glossed as realis. In reality, though, group I subject morphemes are
the same in the realis and irrealis statuses (see Section 6.2.1).
(3-35) memrɨknet
mem
-rɨk -net
get_up.cf -cf -1sg.m|3sg.m.r
‘I (m) would have gotten up’ or ‘he would have gotten up’
Non-serialized independent verb stems can consist of a single vowel, like a
‘consume’, or up to four syllables, like mundumɨndi which means ‘hum’.
The morphology of Tayap verbs is the subject of Chapters 5, 6 and 7.","[85, 86]"
"3.6 Quantifiers
3.6.1 Counting
The traditional counting system in Tayap was based on a person’s fingers and
toes. This is a well-known areal feature (Laycock 1975). The Tayap system allowed
counting up to twenty, although in principle the system could count indefinitely,
because after reaching twenty, one could, I was told, begin counting again on the
body of another person (so ‘twenty-one’ could be ‘two hands and two legs and
one hand one finger on the other side’).
This laborious system, for which there seems to have been no shorthand, disappeared rapidly after villagers began speaking Tok Pisin among themselves in
the 1930s and 1940s. Today it is only vaguely remembered, and is regarded as an
amusing, cumbersome and primitive curiosity by everyone in Gapun.
Villagers still use the Tayap words for ‘one’ through to ‘five’, and they sometimes combine them to denote a number between five and ten. For example, I
once overheard a villager ask another in Tayap how many bags a cocoa buyer who
had come to Gapun had filled (this was a typical instance of using Tayap to “hide
talk” from non-villagers). The addressee, a thirty-year-old man who is a very weak
speaker of Tayap and who under other circumstances never speaks it, responded
by saying manaw towotowo (literally ‘three four’), which in this context meant
seven bags.
Villagers also sometimes use the Tayap word for ‘ten’, but never any of the
others, which are always said in Tok Pisin.
The traditional system, as I recorded it from senior men in the 1980s, is as
follows:
nambar
sene
manaw‘one’
‘two’
‘three’883 Word classestowotowo
ndaram nambar

‘one hand’ (i.e. five)
‘one hand one on the other side’ (i.e. six)
‘one hand two on the other side’ (i.e. seven)
‘one hand three on the other side’ (i.e. eight)
‘one hand four on the other side’ (i.e. nine)
‘two hands’ (i.e. ten)
‘two hands and one toe’ (i.e. eleven)
‘two hands and two toes’ (i.e. twelve)
‘two hands and three toes’ (i.e. thirteen)
‘two hands and four toes’ (i.e. fourteen)
‘two hands and one leg’ (i.e. fifteen)
‘two hands and one leg one toe on the
other side’ (i.e. sixteen)
‘two hands and one leg two toes on the
other side’ (i.e. seventeen)
‘two hands and one leg three toes on the
other side’ (i.e. eighteen)
‘two hands and one leg two toes on the
other side’ (i.e. nineteen)
‘two hands and two legs’ (i.e. twenty)When numbers occur together with other adjectives, they always occur last (other
modifiers can occur in any order; see Section 4.1.1). So:3
(3-75) naŋaw moprɨ sene
naŋaw
moprɨ
sene
woman.dl little.pl two
‘two little women’
There are no ordinal numerals in Tayap, and to express what English expresses as
adverbial numerals (‘twice’, ‘thrice’, ‘four times’, etc.), Tayap uses a construction in3 senea is sene (‘two’) with the conjunction -a; so ‘two-and’Quantifiers89which the number is the main verb and the event that happens a number of times is
nominalized by suffixing the irrealis verb stem with the non-finite suffix -(ŋ)gar (see
Section 4.2). This nominalized event serves as the subject of the number-as-verb.
Examples are:
(3-76)a. Kruniŋi rumb oŋgar manawkɨtak
Kruni =ŋi
rumb

Kruni =erg.m slit_gong_drum strike.irr-nfn.sg

As was discussed in Section 3.1.1.3, the only nouns in Tayap with non-singular
forms are the closed class of nouns denoting some humans, and pigs and dogs. All
other nouns have only one form. To indicate plurality in those nouns, the following
quantifiers may be used. They immediately follow the noun to which they refer:
sambgeneral marker of plurality, most often used with countable
nouns
non samb used with unquantifiable masses like water or food
sami
‘many’, ‘lots of’, ‘plenty’
-ŋgro
used to signify associative plurality on people or place names,
pronouns and interrogative words903 Word classesExamples:

"8.2 Serial verb constructions (svc)
From the previous chapters, it should be amply evident that Tayap has an exuberance of verb forms. Until now, the presentation of Tayap verb forms has for
the most part concentrated on what we might somewhat understatedly call
‘simple verbs’: single, independent verbs that can take the full range of TAM
marking, as well as the full range of subject and object affixes, and function as
sole predicates.
In addition to these ‘simple’ verbs, though, Tayap has the possibility of
joining together verb stems in serial verb constructions (svcs) or complex predicates with the verb ‘to be’ in habituals and progressives (discussed below,
Section 8.3).
Tayap svcs are sequences of verb stems that encode a complex series of
actions. An example is tapratkɨŋgɨatɨkɨtakana, a single complex predicate that
means ‘she will carry him down on her shoulders’:
(8-1) tapr
-at
carry_on_shoulders.irr -3sg.m.nfo-kɨ
-bring-atɨ
-kɨ
-tak

intentionalSerial verb constructions like tapratkɨŋgɨatɨkɨtakana, consist of three distinct
verb stems: two non-final verbs (tap ‘carry on shoulders’ and kv ‘bring1’), and the
final verb of motion atɨkɨ ‘go down’. The two non-final verbs take no marking
for TAM, but, being transitive, they do both take object morphemes. Note that
those two object morphemes -at and -ŋgɨ both encode 3sg.m. Furthermore, the
second one -ŋgɨ is inflected for TAM (in this case, realis status, since it is a non-final object suffix, as will be discussed in Section 8.2.2 below).
Two characteristics mark this word as a single predicate:
(1) the subject of the verb is shared, and encoded only once, on the final verb,
and the object of the first verb and subject of the second are shared; and
(2) the complex predicate can only be negated as a whole. Even though it consists of three distinct verb stems, tap, kV and atɨkɨ, only the final verb (the
same one that takes the subject marking) is negated.
So the negated form of this verb is:
(8-2) tapr
-at
kɨ
-ŋgɨ
carry_on_shoulders.irr -3sg.m.nfo bring -3sg.m.r.o
atɨ
-kɨ
wákare
go_down.irr -irr neg
‘(she) won’t (or didn’t) carry him down on her shoulders’
Further, tapratkɨŋgɨatɨkɨtakana is a single phonological word (see Section 2.7).
Note, however, that the boundary between the non-final object (nfo, which in
this case is -at; see below 8.2.2) and the main final verb that takes subject marking
1 The vowel harmonizes to the vowel of the object.","[249, 250]"
"923 Word classes3.7 Articles
Tayap has no definite article. The definiteness of a referent emerges either through
the context or because it occurs together with a deictic word.
The language does, however, have a word, non, which means ‘a’ or ‘some’ –
in the sense of ‘some man’ or ‘some child’ – and which can function as an indefinite article. The word does not mean ‘one’: to specify a singularity, the quantifier
nambar ‘one’ is used (see Section 3.6.1). The word non can occur independently,
as in the following request, which is heard ubiquitously in Gapun, uttered by
someone asking someone else for betel nut:
(3-80) non kukukwe
non
ku
-ku
-we
indef bring -3sg.f.r.o
-come.sbj
‘give me one/some’ (lit. ‘bring me one/some’)
When non occurs after a noun, it imparts indefiniteness. If non does not occur,
the referent will likely be interpreted as definite. An example is a sentence like
the following:
(3-81) rorŋi ŋgat tanŋgɨn
ror
=ŋi
ŋgat
ta
-n -ŋgɨ
-n
child = erg.m cassowary see.r -s <3sg.m.r.o> -sg|1pl.r.s
This sentence would likely be interpreted to mean ‘the child saw the cassowary’,
but it can mean both ‘the child saw the cassowary’ and ‘the child saw a cassowary’. The context of the utterance would usually make it clear if a definite or
indefinite noun were meant.
If a speaker wanted to emphasize indefiniteness, he or she could use non or
non samb (Section 3.6.2) after the nominal it modifies:
(3-82) a. rorŋi ŋgat non tanŋgɨn
ror
=ŋi
ŋgat
non
ta
-n -ŋgɨ
-n
child =erg.m cassowary indef see.r -s <3sg.m.r.o> -sg|1pl.r.s
‘the boy saw a cassowary’

-n
see.r -s <3sg.m.r.o> -sg|1pl.r.s
‘some (unnamed and possibly unknown) boy saw a cassowary’3.8 Deictics (dx)
Deictics in Tayap locate a referent in space and time, and can be translated as
‘this’ or ‘that’ and ‘here’ or ‘there’. The language has a word ai for ‘here, and anɨnɨ
for ‘there’. These words are used in simple commands to put something or bring
something ‘here’ or ‘there’:
(3-83) a. ainnɨ wo ŋgritukun

Note: the locative clitic =nɨ on anɨnɨ is optional and frequently omitted (as it is in
this example) probably because the word ends with nɨ, which is homophonous
with the locative clitic.","[111, 112, 113]"

"Villagers’ debates and language shift
Something similar to the ‘wind problem’ occurred with a word that I would have
thought was common and uncontroversial – the word for ‘rainbow’. One morning344Tayap-English-Tok Pisin Dictionaryafter a night of heavy rain, a large rainbow appeared in the sky. On my way to
wash my clothes in one of the village waterholes, I saw the rainbow and realized
that I didn’t know what it was called in Tayap. So I asked the first person I saw – a
fluent speaker of Tayap in his late thirties – what one calls a rainbow in Tayap.
“Renbo”, he responded, without missing a beat.
Um, no, I told him, that must be the Tok Pisin word – the Tayap word had to be
something else. The man told me that in that case, he didn’t know, and that I should
go ask his father, sixty-five-year-old Monei Mbanaŋ, who was my main language
informant at the time. I went off to find Monei and thus did my innocent query
launch a month of acrimonious debate from one end of the village to the other.
I found Monei sitting on his veranda and I asked him the word for rainbow.
He pondered for awhile. He told me he couldn’t remember the word offhand; he
needed to think about it. He thought for several days. Finally, he told me that
‘rainbow’ had no single word in Tayap; instead, ‘rainbow’ was expressed by the
verb phrase akɨn tamtiek, ‘cloud is marked with color’. This sounded reasonable
to me, and I duly recorded it. But when I repeated it to other speakers to check
their reactions, I was universally met with disdain. “Em giaman” – ‘He’s lying’,
everyone sneered, using their favorite expression to dismiss another speaker’s
expertise in Tayap. Even though no one could think of the correct term themselves,
they all told me they knew that the phrase Monei had volunteered was wrong.
Days went by and no one could come up with ‘rainbow’. Older villagers
explained to me that their parents and older relatives had warned them about
rainbows, saying they should never walk underneath one, because if they did,
their minds would become clouded and confused. But even though they remembered these cautions, no senior speaker could recall the word for ‘rainbow’
that their parents and relatives had used while articulating them. The word for
‘rainbow’, villagers told me, “i hait” – it was hiding. (In the villagers’ defense, I
should note that rainbows are not exactly common occurrences in Gapun – I only
saw that one the entire eight months I was there in 2009).
Eventually Monei’s old wife, Sopak Waiki, told me that she had a dream in
which the true word for ‘rainbow’ had been whispered to her by a dead ancestor.
The word, she revealed, was mɨnuomb – a word that otherwise means ‘large
round lake’. Sopak said that the way to say ‘rainbow’ in Tayap was to say akɨnnɨ
mɨnuomb utok, ‘a round lake appeared in the clouds’.
I told other senior speakers of Sopak’s revelation. They were unmoved. “Em
giaman”, they all pronounced, impassively.
A few days later, one of the oldest men in the village told me that he had
remembered the word – it was wagurmos.
The other speakers’ judgement fell predictably: “Em giaman”, they all said.
They explained that wagurmos meant the white film one sees in the sky at nightVillagers’ debates and language shift345– that is, the Milky Way. It doesn’t mean ‘rainbow’ at all. Many older speakers also
took the opportunity to disparage the linguistic knowledge of the old man who
had offered wagurmos. That speaker may be old, they said belittlingly, but he’s
“lapun nating” – he’s grown old without having learned anything. All he has,
people said, is “bebi sens” – the sense of a baby.
Weeks passed and frustration grew. But finally, having heard about the
senior speakers’ search for ‘rainbow’, a young man in his 30s one day came and
told me that he had once heard his grandfather, Kruni Ayarpa, say the word for
‘rainbow’. Kruni had been one of my language informants in the 1980s; he died
in the early 1990s. For the last few decades of his life, Kruni had been universally
respected and vaguely feared as an elder who knew everything about Gapun’s
history and who spoke flawless and eloquent Tayap. The young man reported
that as a child, he had once been together with Kruni when women from the
neighboring village of Wongan mentioned rainbows, which are called mamor in
their Kopar language. They asked Kruni what the word in Tayap was. Kruni told
them that it was mamar.
Rather than being a breakthrough, this word, too, was rejected. “It means
‘banana’”, all the old people responded dryly when, without telling them why, I
asked them to define mamar. And indeed, it does mean a kind of banana. But in
the end, unable to come up with a word or expression that satisfied them all, and
undoubtedly growing annoyed at my persistence in questioning them, the older
villagers begrudgingly agreed that mamar must be the word for ‘rainbow’ too,
since Kruni apparently had claimed it was.
My own conclusion is that mamar probably was the Tayap word for ‘rainbow’.
Tayap and Kopar share quite a few nouns, because speakers of the two languages
have been in contact with one another for a very long time. The kind of slight
phonetic variation between mamor and mamar are common in the words shared
by the two languages. For example:crocodile
cockatoo
turtle
lorikeet
hookTayap
orem
kaimwa
pawp
njijerɨk
pipiŋgabuKopar
oreo
keimwa
pup
njijerɨŋ
bibigabuFor those all those reasons, I have entered ‘rainbow’ as one of the definitions of
mamar. I recount the little epic of finally getting that word, though, in order to
illustrate the fact that not all of the entries contained in this dictionary will satisfy
all the current speakers of Tayap.","[363, 364, 365]"
"5.3 Object (o) and subject (s/a) suffixes
5.3.1 Object suffixes
Before going on to discuss the range of TAM distinctions made in Tayap, it will
be useful to distinguish the various forms of the object and subject suffixes that,
together with the verb stems, encode TAM on a verb.
Taking the object suffixes first, note how their forms in irrealis are simply
the realis forms with an r inserted before the vowel in all cases except 1sg, which
retains the same form in both statuses. Interestingly, only the 3pl is distinguished
from the other non-singular suffixes in both paradigms:

Tayap’s subject (S/A) suffixes can be compared in Tables 5.2 and 5.3 below. Irrealis
subject suffixes only mark gender for singular subjects, and realis subject suffixes
do not mark gender at all. Both paradigms collapse second person non-singular,
they distinguish third person plural, and they collapse first and third person
dual. Note that these complex syncretisms are different in different paradigms
(see Section 3.5 for other pronoun paradigms, including the free pronouns and
benefactive suffixes).

verb root belongs, and many are irregular. These subject markers are discussed
in Section 6.2.

"1906 The formation of realis and irrealis verbs6.2 Intransitive verbs in the realis
Intransitive verbs in the realis status display many of the same kinds of stem
changes as characterize transitive verbs. For example, some verb stems alternate between p and Ø, like class 1 transitive verbs, between p and w, like class 2
transitive verbs, between a and ka or o, like class 3 transitive verbs, or between t
and r, like class 4 transitive verbs.
Other alternations exist only for intransitive verbs – for example an alternation between m in the irrealis and p in the realis, as in memkɨnet → pemiet (‘I will
get up’ → ‘I got up’).
As is the case with transitive verbs, none of these variations are predictable,
and there are many verbs, especially verbs of motion, that are irregular. In these
verbs, stem changes between irrealis and realis do not adhere to any of the conventions discussed above.
Intransitive verbs in Tayap do not group into distinct conjugation classes as
neatly as transitive verbs do. Recall that transitive verbs, whatever changes their
verb stems may undergo, all take the same object morphemes. Their subject morphemes also remain largely the same; the only difference being that class 4 and
5 verbs take discontinuous subject morphemes. But even those discontinuous
subject morphemes have regular and predictable forms.
Intransitive verbs are different. There is little or no patterned correspondence between how a verb stem alters between irrealis and realis – say, for
example the m/p alternation just mentioned – and the subject endings taken
by that verb. Compare, for example, the following two verbs, ‘get up’ and
‘stand’:(6-37)future
a. memkɨnet

non-future
b. puŋgot
puŋg
-ot
stand_up.r -sg.m.r
‘I (m) stood up’, ‘he stood up’, ‘you (m) stood up’
Notice that even though both of these verb stems alternate between m in irrealis
and p in the realis, their final subject endings in the non-future are different from
one another: -iet in one case and -ot in the other. This lack of patterned relation
between stem alternation and subject endings is the reason intransitive verbs are
not classified here into “conjugation classes”.
Instead, they are labeled with the looser term “conjugation groups” and identified here and in the dictionary by the variation in endings that they exhibit in
the 1sg masculine and feminine.","[209, 210, 211]"
"2809 Simple and complex sentences9.9 Tail-head linkage
Tayap makes extensive use of tail-head linkage, a phenomenon in which the
last verb of one sentence is repeated as the first verb of the next sentence. It is a
coherence device for structuring discourse and is very common among Papuan
languages (de Vries 2005). In de Vries’s terms, Tayap’s tail-head linkage is the
chained type, utilizing the basic complex clause structures of the language,
namely coordination and subordination.
Some examples, which are taken from the Tayap Texts at the end of this
grammar, are presented below (see those texts for many more examples of this
phenomenon).
The following excerpt is a continuous stretch of speech taken from a narrated
story that is presented in its entirety in Text 1. The repeated inflected verbs are in
bold.

The next sequence is a continuous stretch of speech taken from Tayap Text
3, which describes a walk through the rainforest in which a young boy is
nearly bitten by a snake. Note the tail-head linkage at (9-48 b-c), and (9-48
c-d). In both cases the verb of the previous clause is repeated, with different
inflections.

‘It died and there…’
In most cases of tail-head linkage, only the verb is repeated. The second instance
of the verb usually occurs with a conjunction marker to connect it to the clause
that follows. However, other material can be repeated too: an example is the
oblique NP repeated with the verb in lines (9-47 a-b).","[299, 300, 301]"

Not all place names can function as bare adjuncts, for example Turuŋgwad in the
following example occurs with a locative clitic (glossed Allative):

‘Once upon a time, two men, the two of them went to Turuŋgwad’
When part of a complex NP, locational nouns can take a location affix. In the following example, Murar stream occurs in a locative-marked NP. The place name
Murar is the head of the NP, modified by ‘stream’ which then takes the locative
clitic to refer to the whole NP:

Nouns functioning as heads of NPs are discussed in Chapter 4. Peripheral cases
are discussed there in Section 4.4.","[70, 71]"
"583 Word classesThe first is particularity: the unmarked, generic form of all nouns, including
animate nouns, is feminine.1
The second is sex: a male referent may be specified as masculine and a female
referent feminine.
The third criterion is size and shape: long, thin and large referents tend to be
masculine; short, stocky and small referents tend to be feminine.
Snakes (long and thin) and cassowaries (tall and imposing), therefore, are
prototypically masculine; pigs (fat and stocky) are prototypically feminine. So in
a sentence like ‘he speared a pig’, the object ‘pig’ will be designated by the feminine object suffix -ku unless the speaker specifically wants to point out that it was
male, in which case the masculine object suffix -ŋgɨ would be used.
The difference is as follows:
(3-19) a. ŋɨŋi mbor pokun

"5 Basic verb morphology
5.1 General properties of Tayap verbs
In Tayap a single complex predicate can express the equivalent of an entire
sentence in English. This is most apparent in its serial verb constructions,
which can express a complex action like ‘she intends to carry him down on
her shoulders’ in a single predicate (tapratkɨŋgɨatɨkɨtakana). Serial verb constructions like this are discussed in Chapter 8. For basic sentence structure, see
Section 9.1.
Transitivity, TAM (tense, aspect and mood) and realis/irrealis status are morphologically encoded in verbs by suffixes, with the object suffix preceding the
subject suffix.
In transitive verbs, this occurs in the following manner:
(5-1) a. poŋgro
po
verb stem ‘strike’
in realis-ŋg
-object/undergoer ‘him’
in realis-ro
-subject/actor ‘they’
in realis-ŋgrɨ
-object/undergoer ‘him’
in irrealis-ndak
-subject/actor ‘they’
in irrealis‘they hit him’
b. oŋgrɨndak
o
verb stem ‘strike’
in irrealis
‘they will hit him’
Intransitive verbs, too, signal both subject and status, but many of them tend to
do so in a more fusional manner than is the case for transitive verbs, especially in
the non-future tense (which expresses events or actions that are occurring in the
present or that have occurred in the past).
An example of intransitive verbs is the verb poror ‘sing’. Some of the forms
that this verb takes in the non-future and the future tenses are as follows:
(5-2) a. poror-net
sing.r-1sg.m|3sg.m.r
‘I (m) sang’ or ‘he sang’https://doi.org/10.1515/9781501512209-005poror-nak
sing.r-1sg.f|1pl.r
‘I (f) sang’ or ‘we sang’poror-ŋguk
sing.r-3pl.r
‘they sang’General properties of Tayap verbsb. poror-kɨ-net

sing.irr-irr-1sg.f|
1pl.irrporor-kɨ-ndak
sing.irr-irr-3pl.irr‘I (f) will sing’ or ‘we
will be’‘they will sing’Verbs in Tayap are constructed around verb stems, which never occur alone
(except in certain modification constructions, see Sections 4.5.1 and 4.5.2), and
which also never occur without being marked for status, either realis or irrealis
(although some verbs, e.g. poror above have the same stem for both). The root
forms of these stems – that is, the forms that are available for derivational processes like nominalization, and the citation forms that are entered in the dictionary as the lexical entry for a verb – are the irrealis forms of the stem.
A note is in order on the terms “roots” and “stems” as they are used here.
Roots are the lexical parts of a word, the unanalyzable part left once the
affixes are all taken off. Stems are involved when inflectional affixes apply to
different forms of a root (Aikhenvald 2007: 38–40). So Tayap verb roots have
inflectional stems: that is, for instance, there are separate inflectional stems
for realis and irrealis. In this grammar, “stem” refers to the inflectional possibilities of a verb root, and “root” designates the basic underlying lexical part
of the verb.
Verbs in Tayap have the following structure:
V – O – (A)
V – (S)
Note that verbal morphology, unlike clausal relations, follows a nominativeaccusative alignment system.
Verbs in Tayap mark the following elements:
Status
Has the action of the verb happened or is happening? Has it not happened?
Tense, aspect and mood (TAM)
Is the action described by the verb occurring now? Is it completed? Has it happened or will it happen? Did it not happen? Temporal and modal relations like
these must be marked on the verb.
In transitive verbs, TAM is marked on the verb root, the object suffix and, if
there is one, on the subject suffix as well.","[155, 156, 157]"
"2.4 Vowel harmony
Vowel harmony and regressive assimilation are characteristic features of Tayap
verbs. The vowel of the object morpheme often influences the vowel of the verb
stem or subject morpheme that precedes it.
Compare, for example, the following two forms of the verb ‘set down’:(2-5) a. ŋa=yi
ŋgu ŋgun
-nu -ku
-n
1sg=erg.f 3sg.f set_down.r -s
<3sg.f.r.o> -1sg|3sg.m|1pl.s
‘I set her down’362 Phonology and orthographyb. ŋa=yi

ŋgɨn
-nɨ -ŋgɨ
-n
1sg=erg.f 3sg.m set_down.r -s <3sg.m.r.o> -1sg|3sg.m|1pl.s
‘I set him down’
The same process is evident in the subject markers of the following verb, ‘collect’:(2-6) a. ŋgu=yi
korat
-tu
3sg.f=erg collect.r -s
‘she collected it’b. ŋgu=yi
korat
3sg.f=erg collect.r
‘she collected them’-tɨ
-s-ku
<3sg.f.r. o>-mbɨ
<3pl.r.o>-n
-2sg|3sg.f.r.s-n
-2sg|3sg.f.r.sNote how the vowel immediately preceding the object suffix changes according
to whether the object suffix contains a mid vowel or a back vowel. That it is the
vowel in the object suffix that influences the vowel in the verb stem, and not vice
versa, is clear from the fact that object suffixes are invariant – they are the same
for all verb stems (see Sections 3.5, 5.3.1 and 5.3.2).
In (2-6a) and (2-6b), the morpheme preceding the object is the first part of
a discontinuous subject morpheme. The vowel in that morpheme, which will
always be /u/ or /ɵ/, is often either reduced to a schwa or is omitted altogether,
especially if it occurs after /n/ or medially between /k/ and /ɾ/. For example:
(2-7) a. ŋɨŋi koranukun (pronounced korankun)
ŋɨ=ŋi
kora
-nu -ku
-n
3sg.m=erg collect.r -s
<3sg.f.r.o> -1sg|3sg.m|1pl.s
‘he collected it’
b. ninukun (pronounced ninkun)
ni
-nu -ku
-n
do.r -s
<3sg.f.r.o> -1sg|3sg.m|1pl.s
‘I (m or f) did it’, ‘he did it’, ‘she did it’, ‘we did it’Stress37The orthography used in this grammar and dictionary reflects the vowel deletion.
Note that in those cases when the vowel was not pronounced, it is not written in
the word.
The only other phonotactic rule involving vowels is that following the bilabial nasal /m/ or a velar stop, a vowel can acquire the semivowel /w/, a case of
progressive rounding, as described for Sougb by Reesink (2002a); e.g.:
→ sumwan
(2-8) a. suman ‘big’
b. Mukar (male name) → mukwaɾ
→ aŋgwaɾ
c. a-ŋgar
be.irr-nfn.sg
‘being’2.5 Stress
Stressed syllables are realized as louder and longer than unstressed syllables.
Stress in Tayap is generally not phonemic, and unpredictable stress occurs rarely.
In the dictionary, unpredictable stress occurs on roughly two percent of words.
Stress usually falls on the final syllable of an uninflected word (but see below
for more information about stress on bound morphemes):
(2-9) ambagái ‘men’s house’
karép ‘moon’
kemém ‘long’
koŋgód ‘hour glass drum’
orímb ‘audible fart’
otár ‘fire’
makatók ‘green coconut’
minjiké ‘betel nut’ndugubár ‘backbone’
ŋayár ‘really’
piŋín ‘clitoris’
pokémb ‘cold’
puwás ‘white’
toŋgodíp ‘Malay apple’
tumbúr ‘shoulder’
wekók ‘obscenity’There are a number of non-predictable exceptions to the syllable-final rule. The
orthography used in this grammar and dictionary marks stress explicitly on those
exceptional words. Examples of two-syllable words with non-final stress:
mbímaŋ ‘leech’
símbu ‘maggot’
Examples of longer words with non-final stress:382 Phonology and orthography(2-10) arúmbatak ‘fly’
atáwo ‘older sibling’
mbíoŋgi ‘baby’
emári ‘ancestral spirit’pasákeke ‘frog’
ndagúnɨ ‘furtively’
supwáspwa ‘badly’
tandímɨrit ‘broom for swatting
mosquitoes’
kanjígogo ‘edible bamboo shoot’ uráŋgeba ‘large bullfrog’
nekénduko ‘sharp grass’
wákare ‘no’Syllables with unpredictable stress are far more common with the vowel a than
the other vowels. In the dictionary more than three times as many instances occur
with a as with any other vowel.
In general, stress is a property of a lexical morpheme, not an inflected word,
and thus stress placement is retained under affixation. For example:
munjé ‘man’ munjénum ‘men’
mɨrí ‘forest’ mɨrínɨ ‘in the forest’
There are some minimal pairs differentiated only by stress:
(2-11) a. verb stem tar
‘hear’, ‘take’b. verb stem e
‘hold’
verb stem er
‘fasten’
c.verb stem a- ‘eat’

énkurem! ‘you.pl

atukún ‘eat it!’
nok átukun! ‘pee!’ (lit.
‘pee expel’)
átukun! ‘chop it!’
átukun! ‘marry her!’Reduplicated words retain stress on both forms (reduplication is discussed in
Section 5.5):
(2-12) sumúsumú ‘bat’
towótowó ‘four’
ndɨdᵼ́kdᵼd́ ᵼ́k ‘lumpy’ tomᵼ́ktomᵼ́k ‘spider’Stress39Peripheral case morphemes and possessive morphemes are unstressed:

Inflected verbs take stress on the final syllable of the word as a whole, with
various exceptions, which are conditioned by the conjugation class of the verb,
as well as by TAM and other types of affixation.
Other instances of unusual stress include the following:
(1) In verbs inflected in the perfect aspect and the intentional mood, stress falls
on the syllable that precedes the perfect suffix (-(da)ra) and the intentional suffix
(-(n)ana):
(2-14) a. kakúndara

2sg sago jelly consume.irr -3sg.f.irr.o -intent =q
‘Would you eat sago jelly?’ (if I offer you some)
(2) In verbs inflected in the counterfactual, stress falls on -rɨk, the counterfactual
suffix:
(2-15) akrᵼḱ nukun
ak
-rᵼḱ -nu -ku
-n
eat.cf -cf -s
<3sg.f.r.o> -1sg|3sg.m|1pl.r.s
‘I would have eaten it’
Stress on the counterfactual suffix differentiates it from the progressive suffix
-rɨk- that occurs in some progressive constructions and is always unstressed (see
Sections 8.3.1 and 9.4.3).
(3) In most verbs inflected in the progressive aspect, stress falls on the final syllable of the verb stem for intransitive verbs, and on the ben object morpheme for
transitive verbs:
(2-16) a. yu anakŋa mernɨ warákakkut?
yu anakŋa mer=nɨ
warák

(4) Class 4 verbs in the non-future tense take stress on the last syllable of the verb
stem:
(2-17) a. ŋɨŋi namŋat aŋgi supwáspwa ŋanana nínkun
ŋɨ=ŋi

3pl=erg.pl collect.r -s <3pl.r.o> -3pl.r.s

(5) In the subjunctive mood, verb roots ending in /ɾ/ gain the vowel /ɛ/ before the
imperative ending, and that vowel is stressed, as in all imperatives, see (7) below:
(2-18) a. rar- (irr) ‘look’ → raré- (sbj, so: raré-tet, raré-tak, raré-nkem)
b. sir- (irr) ‘descend’→ siré- (sbj, so: siré-tet, siré-tak, siré-nkem)
(6) Intransitive verbs in irrealis dual forms take stress on the irr morpheme:
́
(2-19) a. ŋgrag ŋayarre okɨ tike
ŋgrag
ŋayar=re
o
-kɨ ́ -tike
afternoon really=temp go.irr -irr -dl.irr
‘let’s the two of us go in the really late afternoon’
b. pereipereikítike!
pereiperei -kí
-tike
race.irr
-irr -dl.irr
‘let’s the two of us race!’
(7) With imperative verbs, stress occurs on the final syllable of the imperative
stem rather than the word as a whole. For example moser ‘buy’ receives stress
on the final syllable of the stem rather than the word: mosé-tukun! (“buy it”). See
Sections 7.1.2.1 and 7.1.2.2.
(8) The subjunctive stems of class 4 verbs lose the final /ɾ/, if they have one, of
their irrealis stem and the remaining stem is always stressed. See Section 7.1.2.2.","[55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61]"
"The ergative case (erg)119Suter’s (2010) description of optional ergativity in the Trans New Guinea
language Kâte shows that the ergative marker is most likely to be used in
clauses with the marked word order of OSV (as opposed to the usual SOV) or
when a focus particle is used on the subject (Suter 2010: 435). In other Trans
New Guinea languages, factors include animacy, agency and control (Suter
2010: 436).
As we have seen, however, there seems to be no single factor or group of
factors which account for the use or absence of the ergative marker in Tayap.","[138, 139]"
"3.4.4 Adverbials of frequency and distribution and ‘not yet’
Two adverbials in Tayap express frequency and distribution (-re), and the temporal relationship ‘not yet’ (ŋgo wákare). Note the formal parallel with the locative =re (see Section 3.4.3 above and Section 4.4); presumably these forms, while
having different functions, have the same origin. The suffix -re occurs on nouns,
and always involves reduplication, as the following examples show.
-re ‘every’

The relative geographical position of objects and people is expressed in Tayap
much more frequently than it is in a language like English. When leaving
someone’s company, for example, one doesn’t just say ‘I’m going’, but rather,
‘I’m going up (in the direction of the rainforest)’ or ‘I’m going down (in the
direction of the mangrove lagoon)’. Similarly, if you have just arrived back
in Gapun from a trip to the village of Wongan, and someone asks you where
you have been, the correct answer is not ‘I was in Wongan’, but ‘I was down
in Wongan’.
Elevational and positional relationships are lexically encoded in Tayap’s rich
set of verbs of motion, virtually all of which are being lost because of their irregular inflectional patterns (see Section 6.2.3). But Tayap also has a set of two freestanding elevationals and seven positionals that are used to pinpoint the location
of an object or a person.
Four of these are oriented according to a spatial array consisting of two axes.","[99, 100]"
