SYNTAX OF PHRASE TYPES
15 Noun phrase structure
15.1 Marking for case.
There are several morphological ways for
distinguishing the syntactic and semantic functions of noun phrases. Peripheral
clause constituents with noun phrases have one of the set of postpositions
described in sect. 17, representing various semantic distinctions. Certain
occurrences of subject also require specific postpositions.
The subject of verbs denoting feelings such as fear, hunger, attraction, lust,
cold, etc. is marked by one of two postpositions: mä indicates 'temporary
state' and te 'habitual state'.","[39, 40]"
"The quotative is another type of transitive sentence (see sect. 14).
1.2 Stative transitive. This is a special form of transitive, directly related to
the Stative clause (see sect. 1.5). It has most of the formal characteristics
described above for transitive clauses, including the same word order, object
noun phrase or verb prefix, and subject noun phrase or prefix. In this case,
however, the postposition (to which the subject prefix may attach) can be
either te or m . When te occurs it carries the meaning 'habitual state' not 'past
tense' as in the non-stative transitive clauses. When m occurs it means
'temporary state'. Both te and m occur with the same meanings in simple
stative clauses (sect. 1.5). Free pronoun subjects do not cooccur with the
prefixed te and ma.",[3]
"Examples (372) and (373) show that to with intransitive verbs results in a
pseudo-transitive clause (te 'PAST' cooccurs with subject agreement prefixes,
see sect. 1.3).
(2) There is a sub-class of verbs which have stems that are inherently neutral
and which may be formed into either transitive or intransitive stems through
morphophonological processes. This is explained in sect. 23.
18.6 Modifier.
Adjectival verbs occur in their uninflected forms as modifiers
of other (inflected) verbs (see sect. 15.3 for a similar modifier function in
noun phrases):
ihcuran pej
intoj pej
ihkin hi
ihkrer jicu'(someone) killed it well'
'he jumped well'
'he stopped liking'
'he stopped eating'19 Adjective phrase structure
The possible combinations of modifier sequences in noun phrases are
discussed in sect. 15.3. Both adjectives (in noun phrases) and adjectival verbs
can be followed by the suffixes // 'augmentative' and re 'diminutive'. The
suffixes primarily modify the adjective/verb but in the case of re the noun is
often modified as well.
(374)rop ita
im-pej- ti
dog DEM 3- good-AUG
'This dog is very good.'",[60]
"(Numerals and quantifiers like crere 'few' act like verbs and always require
to be separated from another verb by ne 'and').
Equation is treated by linking the two nouns in a coordinate noun phrase
which is both the subject of a main clause in which the verb is ipipen 'be
equal' and of a subordinate clause which contains the attribute or action being
compared. In the case of an active verb, the subordinator is to. Within context
the attribute can be omitted.
(112)capi me kryt cati
pipen
Capi and Kryt big
equal
'Capi and Kryt are equally big.'",[17]
"Elsewhere, the subject is not morphologically marked, and the direct object
is also not marked. The syntactic function of noun phrases is distinguished
primarily by word order (sect. 1).
15.2 Genitives. Nouns are divided into two classes:
a) Inalienably possessed nouns occur with obligatory possessor person
prefixes or free form nominal possessors. Most of these nouns denote body
parts or kinship relationships. For possessor prefix forms, see sect. 16.
In inalienably possessed noun phrases, the possessor is followed directly by
the possessed.",[41]

"CANELA-KRAHÖ*
Jack Popjes and Jo Popjes
0 INTRODUCTION
The Ramkokamekra Canela are part of the Je linguistic family, spoken on
the great central plateau of Brazil. Other Je-speaking people include the
Timbira, Apinaje, Xerente, Xavante and Kajapo, located mosdy south west of
the Canela (Nimuendaju 1946, Crocker 1961).
The Canela language is spoken with minimal dialect variations by three
separate groups. The Ramkokamekra Canela live in a village of about 800
people about 50 miles south of Barra do Corda, Maranhäo. About 350
Apanjekra Canela live 30 miles west of the Ramkokamekra Canela village.
Some social interaction occurs, and there have been a few cases of
intermarriage. The language is also spoken by the 900 Kraho of Northern
Goias, over 200 miles south west of the two Canela villages. There has been
no social interaction to speak of in recent years between the Kraho and the
Canela villages.
The total number of speakers is thus around 2000. Bilingualism and
acculturation vary from village to village as well as between age groups and
between sexes. Generally die most bilingual are the young men in their teens
and early twenties. In the Ramkokamekra village at least 70 people can read
and write, at least to some extent, in Portuguese and in Canela. There has
been extensive contact for over 50 years with the surrounding Portuguese
speaking Brazilian population. The Canela-Kraho have, however, been able to
preserve their culture and life style, customs and language, to a remarkable
degree. Although both bilingualism and acculturation are increasing in all
locations, thus far the changes are relatively small. Both groups appear to be
growing economically dependent on the government.
SYNTAX OF THE SENTENCE OR CLAUSE
1 Word order
There are 10 clause types: six verbal clause types and four non-verbal. They
are distinguished on the basis of their obligatory constituents. In the listing that
follows, the constituents appear in their normal, unmarked order. Following the
discussion of the ten clause types (sects. 1.1 - 1.10), there is a summary of
basic word order patterns (sect. 1.11) and a description of peripheral clause
constituents (sect. 1.12).
1.1 Transitive. Differences between this clause type and the other types are
most clearly seen in the past tense forms. The clause nucleus consists of a

either a pronoun, a noun phrase or a prefix attached to the past indicative
tense marker te. (See sect. 16 for free and bound pronouns).
If the subject is a noun phrase, the tense marker te occurs immediately
following it, without a prefix. The object may be a noun phrase or a person
prefix bound to the verb. There is one subgroup of transitive verbs where the
object in the third person is not overtly marked by a prefix. The long form of
the verb occurs with the past tense. (See sect. 23). The examples that follow
include some with present and future tenses also.

'The knife cut me.'","[1, 2]"
"16 Pronoun system
The pronoun system has both bound and free definite personal pronouns.
There are also indefinite personal pronouns which differentiate between
specific, non-specific, negative indefinite and plural. There are also
demonstrative, reflexive and reciprocal pronouns.",[47]
"6 Causatives
Any verb can be made causative by the use of the transitive verb to I ton
'make/do'. The verb to be made causative is placed in a subordinate clause,
which is marked as such by the postposition na, and which immediately
precedes the causative verb.
The direct object of the causative verb agrees with the subject of the verb in
the subordinate clause. In the case of the third person, the direct object markerBrought to you by | Massachusetts Institute of Technology - MIT Libraries

subordinate clause is transitive, the subject is omitted.

"Vocalic release of consonants
All consonants, except kft(k), ts(x), rj(g) and h(h) have a vocalic release
utterance final, and in some dialects also utterance medial. The occurrence and
strength of this release varies and fluctuates freely between dialects. The
quality and occurrence of the release are predictable: v(w) and y(j) syllable
final always occur with release, the quality of which is as follows:
v(w) has a low central vowel quality [a];
y(j) has a high front vowel quality [i], except when the y(j) follows i in
which case its release has a low central vowel quality [a].
All other consonants have a release which has the quality of the preceding
vowel, except when the vowel is a, in which case it releases into a high front
vowel, [i]. None of these releases are written in the practical orthography.
Long vowels contrast with short vowels, but their occurrence is fairly rare,
and in the practical orthography vowel length is written only when it is the
only distinguishing feature between two otherwise identical words:
ma 'benefactive' and mää 'rhea'
caxwa 'night' and caaxwa 'salt'
pe 'DP' and pee 'until'
te 'PAST' and tee 'in vain'Intonation patterns
Some common intonation patterns are illustrated below.",[63]

The distinguishing characteristic of the adjectival clause is
the class of verb: all members of the class occur also as adjectives in noun
phrases and as adverbial modifiers in verb phrases (see sects. 15.3, 18.6 and
19). As verbs in adjectival clauses they are always inflected, by means of a
prefix, for person of the subject. A free form subject may also occur.

These forms are also used as interrogative pronouns, with the meanings 'who'
and 'what' respectively (sect. 10).",[49]
"A system of personal pronouns is also used as a means of anaphoric
reference. Complete lists of free and bound form are given in sect. 16. The
reflexive and reciprocal pronouns amji and ajpen (described in sect. 4) are also
a means of anaphoric reference.

The clause nucleus consists of a subject and a verb. The
subject may be a free subject pronoun, a noun phrase, or a person marker
prefixed to the verb. With the majority of intransitive verbs, the long form of
the verb (see sect. 23) occurs in the past tense, and the subject is prefixed to
the verb, unless it is a noun phrase. With a small sub-class of irregular
intransitive verbs, the long form of the verb does not occur in the past tense
unless the verb is non-final in the verb phrase. When the short form of the
verb occurs, the subject may be a free pronoun or noun phrase.

9 Pragmatic and discourse characteristks
In other parts of this paper there is discussion of a number of discourseconditioned phenomena: ellipsis and dummy verb (sect. 3), various types of
anaphora (sect. 13), free form pronouns used for emphasis (sect. 16), certain
anaphoric uses of demonstratives and cooccurring postpositions (sect. 16), and
the fronting and left-dislocation of the direct object, with cooccurrence of a
pronominal copy prefixed to the verb, for purpose of focus and emphasis (sect.
1).
Here I discuss ways in which foregrounding and backgrounding is
distinguished in Canela narrative discourse. These terms, for the two principal
types of discourse information, are used here in much the same way as by
Hopper and Thompson (1980) and many others: foregrounding consists of main
events that are important to the narrator's purpose, whereas backgrounding
includes both events and nonevents that generally support the foregrounded
material but are not themselves part of the main thread of the discourse, e.g.
setting, evaluation, description, reference to custom, flashback, recapitulation.
The two types of information are distinguished primarily by contrasting
aspect particles and past tense markers, and the (irregular) use of the long
form of verbs (foregrounded) and the short form of verbs (backgrounded).
Customary/habitual aspect is marked by hot pe (foregrounded) and ajco
(backgrounded). The regular past tense form te ('recent' in sect. 18.1) is used
in foregrounded, and a special form pe 'DISTANT PAST' in backgrounded,
sections of the discourse. The long form of the verb is used in foregrounded
clauses even when it occurs clause final, thus over-riding the usual syntactic
conditioning (see sect. 23). The short form of the verb is found in
backgrounded clauses, except when the continuative aspect particles apu and
ame occur.
Two examples are given below to show contrasting foregrounded and
backgrounded sequences from two texts. Single parentheses signal
foregrounding, and square brackets backgrounding (the specific devices are thus
marked in the Canela, and the whole sections in the English translation):Brought to you by | Massachusetts Institute of Technology - MIT Libraries

Location pronouns commonly occur with the postposition ri or mä indicating
place. The free form he which frequently follows location pronouns indicates
that the location is in sight of both the speaker and the hearer, and the speaker
may even be pointing to it.

Postpositions are not normally separated from the noun phrase although some
rare irregular occurrences have been noted. They cannot occur as independent
forms.
Postpositions relate to people, things, actions and locations. Below they are

"The negator affects the form of the verb in that it may be preceded only by
the long form (see sect. 23). Any constituent may be negated, subject, object,
indirect object, verb or any of the peripheral constituents, and the negator
usually follows the constituent to which it refers. Any word may be negated:
verbs, nouns, including nominalized verbs, pronouns, aspect or manner
markers, etc. When constituents which are marked by a postposition are
negated, the negator most commonly follows the postposition:

reflect a subtle distinction in meaning.
In a sentence the non-verbal constituents are commonly negated by placing
them clause initial and then negating the verb. Compare the normal order of
the positive statement (210) with the corresponding negative statement in which
the focus of the negation is on the instrument phrase (211):

23 MORPHOLOGYThis section discusses some general morphological characteristics of verbs
(see sect. 18 for treatment of particular verb and verb phrase categories).
Nearly all verb stems have two morphemic shapes, a long form and a short
form. A few verbs have only a single form, e.g. hitep 'cut', cucäc 'singe'.
For those with two forms, the long occurs whenever the tense is (recent) past,
and elsewhere whenever the verb stem is non-final in the verb phrase. (There
is a small sub-class of intransitive verbs which have the long form in the past
tense only when the stem is non-final, see sect. 1.4). The short form of the
verb occurs elsewhere. Examples:
long formshort formihcuran
ton
ihcahhyr
catorihcura
to
ihcahhy
cato'(someone) kills it'
'(someone) makes it'
'(someone) whips it'

There are eight peripheral clause

location, benefactive, instrument, directional, comparison, manner and aspect,
commonly occur between the subject and the object in transitive clauses,
between the subject and the verb in other verbal clauses, and before the first
nuclear element in non-verbal clauses. These peripheral elements may occur,
subject to certain semantic constraints, in all clause types.
Directional words and phrases are usually found in intransitive clauses with
intransitive verbs of movement. They usually precede the verb.

This number is further reduced to two if they take the form of long phrases or
