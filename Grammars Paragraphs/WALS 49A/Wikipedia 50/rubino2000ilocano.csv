This grammar outline is aimed primarily at introducing the fundamentals of Ilocano word
formation that may assist readers in using this dictionary. 1 I will break up the grammar outline
into grammatical classes and discuss morphological forms. For a more complete treatment of Ilocano morphology and a discussion of issues in Ilocano syntax, please see Rubino (1997).
SYNOPSIS FOR LINGUISTS: Ilocano, like its sister Philippine languages, is a predicate-initial
language with a complex, head-marking, highly-prefixing morphology. Affixes denote a wide
range of grammatical categories including aspect, focus, number, volition, transitivity, reciprocity, and some lexical categories such as pretense, smell, and relative size. Noun phrases may
function as predicates and arguments. As arguments, they are usually preceded by noun markers
(articles or demonstratives) that inflect for case (core vs. oblique), number (singular vs. plural),
and time. Articles also inflect for reference (common vs. personal). Pronouns inflect for person,
number, and case (ergative, absolutive, and oblique). There is an inclusive/exclusive distinction
in the first person plural forms. When core (non-oblique) pronouns are used with predicates, they
are enclitic. There is a pervasive particle (nga/a) used to link related constituents (heads and
attributes) called a ligature (§12), and a number of uninfecting adverbial particles (§7.2). All
roots (non-p/articles) may be nominalized or verbalized by morphology or syntactic function.","[35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41]"
"12. The Ligature (ng)a
The ligature (or linker) is a connective particle used in Philippine languages to connect various
syntactic parts of a sentence (heads and attributes). The Ilocano ligature has two written variants:
nga before vowels and a before consonants. However, in speaking, the ligature nga is usually
preferred regardless of phonetic environment.
Among the many uses of the ligature are the following: connect adjectives and nouns,
introduce complements or appositional constituents of all syntactic categories, separate the
negative particle saan from the verb in negative declarations, and separate repeated words in
emphatic constructions:
Sao a sao ni Kondring.
naimas a digo
Saankami a napan.
Nalaka a daiten.
ti kabsatko a lalaki
ti nuang a napigsaKondring is always talking.
delicious broth
We didn't go.
It is easy to sew it.
my brother
the strong water buffaloWhen the ligature (ng)a joins non-predicative syntactic elements, notice that the two
conjoined constituents do not predicate:
Naimas ti bibingka.
naimas a bibingkaThe rice cake is delicious,
delicious rice cakeNi Erlinda ti maestra.
ni Erlinda a maestraErlinda is the teacher.
Erlinda, the teacherGrammar Outline * lxxxi13. Clause Combining
Various processes are involved when Ilocano clauses are combined. In certain combinations, one
clause becomes a well-integrated (dependent) constituent of another. These include relative
clauses and complement clauses. Clauses may also combine where neither is the superordinate
clause; both may function independently. Such is the case with coordinate clauses. This section
will discuss the following clause types:
13.1
13.2
13.3
13.4Relative clauses
Complement clauses
Adverbial clauses
Coordination13.1 Relative clauses
A relative clause is a clause that modifies the head of the noun phrase (NP) to which it belongs; it
'relates' a piece of information to its head noun. Relative clauses are linked to their head noun in
Ilocano with the ligature (ng)a: NP = head noun + ligature (ng)a + relative clause.
ti tao a manakem
ti balasang nga agur-uray kaniak
ti al-alia a nakitanathe man that is wise
the maiden who is waiting for me
the ghost that he sawThe head noun taking a relative clause must be in the absolutive position with respect to
the predicate of the relative clause. A head noun that functions as an actor will take an actor
focus verb, a head noun that functions as a patient will take a patient focus verb, etc.
ti tao a nagsurat
ti mannala a sinuratanna
ti sarsuela a sinuratna
ti nagan nga insuratna
ti ubing a nagsangit
ti balasang a nakitak
ti al-alia a nakakita kaniak
ti tukak nga innalada
diay babai a kinasaok13.2the man who wrote (actor)
the dancer to whom he wrote (direction)
the opera he wrote (patient)
the name he wrote down (theme)
the child who cried (actor)
the maiden I saw (nonactor)
the ghost that saw me (actor)
the frog that they got (patient)
the girl with whom I spoke (comitative)Complement clausesComplement clauses are those that can be considered as embedded arguments of a matrix
predicate. Most complement clauses have the potential to stand alone as a complete phrase,
except those that are 'reduced', sharing a co-referential argument with the matrix clause that is
only overtly expressed in the matrix clause.
Kayatko nga agawidka.
Kayatko ti agawid.","[80, 81]"
"Grammar Outline * liii
Transitive verbs, on the other hand, take two core arguments. When encoding two
arguments by enclitic pronouns, the actor of the action is encoded by the =ko series pronouns
(ergative case), while the non-actor takes absolutive case (=ak series pronouns). All noun phrases
in these cases are given core case marking; all other nouns are peripheral and encoded in the
oblique.

3.1 Articles
Articles in Ilocano encode number (singular and plural), two cases (core and oblique), and
differentiate personal nouns (names, vocatives, etc.) from non-personal nouns as shown in the
following paradigm:
Non-personal articles
Singular
PluralCore
ti
dagitíOblique
iti
kadagitiCore
ni
daOblique
kenni (ken ni)
kadáPersonal articles
Singular
PluralThe core and oblique distinction in Ilocano can be summarized in the following way.
Core nouns may be morphological arguments of verbs. They may be replaced by an enclitic
pronoun of either the =ko or =ak series. Oblique nouns, however, are not verbal arguments in
that they cannot be replaced by enclitic pronouns, although they may play an essential role in the
semantic frame of a verb.
Grammatically intransitive verbs in Ilocano may take one enclitic pronoun in the =ak
series. When this particular argument appears as a full noun phrase, it takes core case marking:
nangán; nagsángit
Nangának.
Nangán ti babài.
Nagsángitda.ate (intransitive); cried (intransitive)
late.
The girl ate.
They cried.","[48, 49, 50, 51, 52]"
"Ilocano transitive verbs and possessed nouns may express both the actor and patient (or
possessor/possessed) pronominally with enclitics. In this case, the =ko pronouns express the
agent (or possessor) and the =ak pronouns express the patient (or possessed entity). Some of the
forms have fused together and are now portmanteau enclitics that neutralize certain combinations,
i.e. -mo/-na + -ak = -nak, -yo/-da + ak = -dak, -na + -ka = -naka, -da/-kami + -ka- -daka, etc.4

"THE DICTIONARY
The present dictionary is a culmination of my research as a Ph.D. graduate student and lecturer in
the Department of Linguistics at the University of Califomia-Santa Barbara and a senior
research associate at the Research Centre for Linguistic Typology at the Australian National
University. I began ""collecting"" Ilocano words, however, in the early eighties, reading the
weekly Ilocano magazine, Bannawag, which was often brought home by visiting or migrating
relatives. It was not until my college years at the University of California at Los Angeles that I
was aware that an Ilocano dictionary had been published in 1956 by Morice Vanoverbergh,
which served as a skeleton for the present dictionary.
As any Ilocano can confirm, the Ilocano language is not spoken uniformly in the northern
provinces of Luzon. Regional variations in intonation, grammar, and the lexicon have
necessitated several trips to all the Ilocano speaking regions, which resulted in my meeting many
esteemed Ilocano poets and writers and monolingual Ilocano speakers who served as consultants
for regional and literary vocabulary. Members of the Philippine Information Society in San
Fernando and Bangued, the Superior Court of Laoag, and DZNL radio in San Fernando
graciously volunteered their time to aid me in this respect, providing much encouragement to
complete this project. The Sanglay Law Office of San Fernando, La Union assisted me in many
matters while I was outside the Philippines.
The root-based format of the dictionary matches that of previously published dictionaries
of languages of similar typologies. As the morphology (affix system) in Philippine languages is
rather complex, compiling a nonroot-based dictionary might take the greater part of a lexicographer's life before a good portion of the important words in the language were documented. It
is my belief that a root-based dictionary would be more beneficial to native Ilocanos, students of
Ilocano, linguists, and anthropologists because it allows the users to see affixal permutations and
better understand the essence of the complex morphological system.
The grammatical affixes were put into the dictionary in the same section as lexical roots.
This was done merely for convenience in word searching by the user who is not expected to
determine the morpheme class before looking up each word. It may also be a useful method of
arranging lexicons of languages with highly prefixing typologies such as Ilocano.
Common Ilocano words or bases where the boundary between the root and affix has been
phonetically fused may be found in the dictionary under independent entries to simplify
dictionary searches. For instance, the word sumrek 'to enter' from the root serrek 'enter' may be
found under both entries. Even native Ilocano speakers experience some difficulty determining
the lexical roots in these cases.
A short introduction to Ilocano grammar has been included to outline rudimentary aspects
of Ilocano phonology, morphology, and syntax as an aid to natives and nonnatives alike. As theIntroduction * xiii
short grammar is merely a brief synopsis of the system, it is broken down in terms of
morphological classes, exemplifying paradigms that may aid users of the dictionary in their
lexical searches or in constructing simple sentences. It is by no means to be taken as a thorough
representation of the grammar of the language. Those interested in seeing the most thorough
grammar of the language are encouraged to try to acquire a copy of my Ph.D. dissertation or
Morice Vanoverbergh's 1955 Iloko grammar.
Nonnative Ilocano speakers using this dictionary will find the Affix Cross-Reference List
useful when looking up polymorphemic (derived and inflected) words. It lists the most common
prefixes and all suffixes, infixes, reduplications, and enclitics, which are written in Ilocano
orthography as joined to their roots. Since derivational morphology in Ilocano is extremely
productive, not all derivations are given with each root. I have tried to include the most common
derivational patterns with the most high-frequency roots for users who are not yet familiar with
the morphological system of the language, and also to show that the resulting meanings of many
derived items are not always semantically transparent. The introductory phonology section
outlines the pronunciation of native words and also introduces the user to the basics of Ilocano
phonology, including stress (vowel length), stress shift, morphophonemics, and syllabification.
Stress is shown with each root, but not with the derived forms unless it is idiosyncratic. Tagalog
equivalents are given for many of the entries, as are equivalents in many of the important
languages of Northern Luzon for a large number of basic words to aid comparativists.
As this is the first edition of a root-based dictionary written without financial support for
adequate field editing or typing/research assistance, it fails to be as thorough as I would have
desired. I welcome all comments, criticism, and suggestions, and encourage the users to contact
me regarding the dictionary or any aspect of the Ilocano language they find interesting. It is my
hope that the dictionary can be improved and expanded one day in the future from the comments
of the users so as to be of greater value. I can be reached via electronic mail at
ilocano@philippines.to or through regular mail at the Department of Linguistics, University of
California, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA.
Although the Ilocano language is spoken as a lingua franca of Northern Luzon and in

particular body that I am aware of is presently working to modernize the language or create
materials for its instruction in the Philippines. It is my fervent hope that such a committee will
evolve to research the role of the Ilocano language in the twenty-first century and perhaps decide
how the language can effectively deal with the changing world into the third millennium. If such
a committee were to develop, I would be honored to be able to offer my time, research, and

"Benefactive focus
The absolutive argument of benefactive verbs is usually the beneficiary of an action, but in some
cases the person encoded in the absolutive case can be seen as having the action of the verb done
in his/her place rather than for his/her benefit. It is formed with the circumfix i- -an (past: in -an),
morphologically a combination of a theme prefix and a directional suffix.

of this particular focus, derived pag- words usually appear in discourse as non-predicative nouns.

"Patient focus
Patient focus verbs take an argument in the absolutive case whose semantic role with respect to
the verb is that of a 'patient' (an affected entity or target of the action of the verb). The patient
focus suffix is -en (perfective -in-). The suffix -en typically forms transitive verbs in which the
absolutive argument is directly affected by a volitional actor.

'What did you eat?' (Perfective form of kaneri)DirectionalfocusThe directional focus is formed with the suffix -an. It indicates that the absolutive argument is a
locative of some kind or some kind of partially affected patient. The suffix -an may also be used
with certain verbs to indicate addition or removal. It is used with many roots to indicate a human
patient in the case frame, i.e., takawen 'to steal something' vs. takawan 'to rob someone'. The
morphological cover term directional focus is reserved for the -an verb class, not because of the
semantic properties shared by all the members of the class, but due to certain semantic changes
that may indicate the direction or location of an action with a number of roots, i.e., sagaden 'to
sweep (dirt)' vs. sagadan 'to sweep (the floor)'.

Actor focus
Actor focus verbs take at most one core argument in the absolutive case whose relationship to the
verb is that of 'actor' (semantic agent or experiencer). Actor focus verbs may be formed with the
prefixes ag- (durative), ma-lmaka- (stative or potentive), or the infix -um- (punctual or
inchoative). Transitive verbs may be detransitivized with mang- (distributive).

preceded by the complementizer no in this case:
Ammök no sinnö ti nagturpös.
I know who graduated.
Ammom no âpay a kasdiây?
Do you know why he is like that?",[78]
"3.2 Demonstratives
Ilocano demonstratives, like the articles, also inflect for plurality and case. There are no special
forms, however, to differentiate personal nouns from non-personal ones. Ilocano demonstratives
are traditionally classified with regard to three degrees of space and time.",[53]
"The prefix ma- (perfective form na-) is also used to form involuntary or stative verbs (and
adjectives) that take only one core argument in the absolutive case.
maldaang
maüyong
malmes
/natnägto be sad

root) or transitive potentives, where the agent is expressed in the ergative case.

"6.1 The categories of verbs
6.1.2 Focus (verbal orientation) and transitivity
One notable distinction present in every affixed verb is the encoding of what has been termed
'focus' in Philippine linguistics, referring to formal marking that reflects the privileged syntactic
status of the absolutive noun phrase. Ilocano verbs assign 'focus' to their absolutive nominal
(=ak pronoun NP), the nominal in the most syntactically privileged position in terms of the
semantic and grammatical relationship the nominal has with the verb. Simple intransitive verbs
such as ag-, -um- and mang- verbs, for instance, take at most one core nominal as the argument
whose semantic relationship to the verb is usually 'actor' or single-argument 'experiencer'.

"Certain affixes, however, such as -en and -an, encode transitive frames that may assign
two nominals in core case, an agent (actor) encoded in the ergative case, and a nonactor (patient,
location, recipient, benefactor, reason, or theme, etc.) encoded in the absolutive case. Since the
absolutive argument in focus for these verbs is a nonagent/actor, they are called ""goal focus
verbs"". Because these verbs can take two core nominals, they are grammatically transitive.

"6.2 Detransitivizing strategies for goal focus verbs
All goal focus (grammatically transitive) verbs in Ilocano can be changed into actor focus
(grammatically intransitive) verbs with detransitivizing affixes. This strategy is employed either
to form the antipassive, whereby an unindividuated patient (grammatical object) is put into the
oblique case and rendered indefinite, or it is used when the verb must be detransitivized as
required by the syntax, as in relative clause formation (see section 13.1). Note the differences
between the following sentences with transitive verbs and their detransitivized counterparts;

"1.2 The enclitic absolutive pronouns (=ak series)
The enclitic absolutive pronouns are referred to in the dictionary as the =ak series pronouns to
avoid confusion among many linguistic traditions of naming them (absolutive, nominative,
focus). In this grammar sketch, we will refer to them as absolutives, as they encode both single
arguments of intransitive verbs and patient (object) arguments of transitive verbs, the absolutive
category. As second position enclitics, they usually attach to the first constituent of their phrase.
The absolutive (=ak series) paradigm is as follows:

In negative constructions, the absolutive pronouns encliticize to the negative particle
(saan or di) in the verb phrase, the first constituent of the verb phrase:
Saânda a nangân.
Dida nangân.",[42]
"6.3.5 Immediacy with apagThe prefix apag- is used to indicate immediate fulfillment of an action or state. When denoting
the English concept as soon as, the actor is encoded in the ergative case. With stative roots, it
may indicate a state not fully attained.

1.3 The ergative enclitic pronouns
The ergative enclitic pronouns are used to indicate possession of a nominal (concrete noun or
nominalization) and to indicate the actor of a transitive verb (see section 6). In the body of this
dictionary, they are also referred to as the =ko series pronouns to avoid confusion in the many
linguistic traditions of naming them (actor, nonfocus subject, genitive). As enclitics, they have
the same morpho-syntactic properties as the =ak series pronouns. With verb phrases, they attach
to the first constituent.
The =ko series paradigm is outlined below:

theirThe first and second person singular pronouns have two forms =ko, =k\ and =mo, =m,
respectively. The forms =k and =m are used after vowels and fuse with the suffixes =en or -an
where the final -n of the suffix is lost, making these pronouns more like affixes than clitics:
balayko
pusam
inumek
Intedko kenkuana.my house (f. balay 'house')
your cat (f. pusa 'cat')
I (will) drink something, (f. inumen 'to drink something')

"6. Verbs
An interesting feature about Ilocano (and other Philippine languages) is that every root in the
language that can act as a noun can also be transformed into a verb by means of syntactic placement or verbalizing morphology. Because the initial position is reserved for the predicate, any
noun in that position may take on a predicative function. Conversely, verbs may occur in nominal
functions (after articles or demonstratives). Ilocano does not have a copular (to be) verb:
kayo
Napan.
ti napantree; It is a tree.
He went,
the one who wentdaytoy kayo
Kayo daytoy.this tree
This is a tree.lalaki
Lalaki.boy.
He is a boy.",[60]

"xiv * Introduction
The older Spanish system vs. the modern system
Although perhaps the majority of Ilocanos continue to use the older Spanish spelling system, I
choose to abide by the conventions accepted in most modem publications and the Bannawag
magazine. Here, I briefly outline the two systems:
Vowels are the same in both: a, e, i, o, u\ where e represents two distinct sounds in the
southern dialects (see Phonology).
Consonantal representation varies as follows. Differences between the systems are
highlighted in boldface. The starred consonants in the second (Spanish orthography) column are
used only in loanwords:Ilocano sound [IPA]Spanish orthographyPP*f

chalkboardThe idiosyncrasies of the older Spanish-based system are eliminated in the modern
system as follows:
The letters c and g used in the older Spanish spelling system no longer represent two
sounds. In the old system, c and g before a front vowel (;', e) represented [s] and [h] respectively.
In other environments, they represented [k] and [g], respectively:

Before the arrival of the Spaniards in the sixteenth century, the Ilocanos employed a syllabary
resembling the Vedic scripts of India used in various other languages found throughout the
Philippines and Indonesia. It is similar to the scripts used by the Tagalogs and Pangasinenses,
although unlike these, the Ilocano script was innovated to designate coda consonants. In the
Tagalog script, readers were expected to supply the coda consonants from the context, as only
consonants in initial syllable position were written, with a diacritic representing the appropriate
vowel. Although this script is no longer in use in modern Ilocano, I show it below, taken from
the Ilocano Doctrina Cristiana of 1621.","[13, 14, 15]"

/a/. The low central vowel is the most common vowel in the language. Of all the vowels, this one
is least subject to variation:

alawagi
atsara[ba:.sa]
[?a.la.wa:.gi]
[?at.tja:.ra]reading

picklesId. The orthographic symbol 'e' in Ilocano constitutes two separate sounds in southern speech, and
one sound in the northern dialects. In the northern dialects (Ilocos Norte, Ilocos Sur), it corresponds
to a front, central lax vowel [e] similar to the e in pet.
In the southern dialects, the letter 'e' represents two separate vowel sounds. In Spanish
loanwords, it is equivalent to the northern pronunciation. In native words, however, it is pronounced
as a high to high-mid, centralized back unrounded vowel [ui] that does not occur in word-final
position.

dandruffloi and lui. Historically, the vowels o and u did not meaningfully contrast. In the native syllabary,
they were both represented by one character (or by a small dot underneath the syllabic character
corresponding to their consonantal onset). After the arrival of the Spaniards and the incorporation
of many Spanish loanwords in Ilocano vocabulary, native Ilocanos were able to distinguish these
vowels and chose to do so in subsequent orthographic practice. The [o] vowel is a rounded upper
mid vowel similar to the Spanish o in no, while the [u] vowel is a rounded high back vowel similar
to the Spanish u in azul with a more lax interpretation in unstressed environments.
Word-finally, lui is realized as [o], while in word-medial positions and stressed environments, as [u]. In Spanish loanwords, the Spanish pronunciation is retained for these vowels.

contribute to a change of meaning in a few words. Stress assigned to an open syllable (syllable
ending in a vowel) entails that the vowel is long:

Stress in Ilocano falls on the last syllable if the penultimate syllable is closed, i.e., if the last
vowel is preceded by two consonants or a consonant followed by a glottal stop (written
in Ilocano

Each root carries an underlying stress on the penult or final syllable. The placement of the stress may
shift to the following syllable under the following conditions:
a. For stems ending in a consonant or the vowel a, the stress shifts one syllable to the right with
suffixation (the -en or -an suffixes). The stress does not shift one syllable to the right if the stressed
vowel of the root is preceded by two different consonants, a consonant and a glide (vowel i, u, or o
+ another vowel), or a consonant followed by a glottal stop:

The stress may shift one syllable to the left under the following conditions:
a. Certain kinship terms that refer to specific relatives (related to the speaker or addressee) such as
ama 'father', ina 'mother', and apo 'grandparent' shift their stress one syllable to the left following
the personal article ni or any of its variants {ken, kada, or da):

"A Note on the Orthography
In orthographic systems that have been used to write Ilocano since the 1600s, two systems have
predominated. The older system is based on Spanish orthography and the newer system is the
standardized alphabet accepted for the Tagalog language, as used in the weekly Ilocano
magazine, Bannawag. The orthography is mostly phonemically based for the consonants, but not
for the vowels. Among the five vowels (a, e, i, o, u) used in Ilocano writing, the letter e
corresponds to two separate phonemes in the southern dialects, a mid front vowel, and a high
back unrounded vowel. The orthographic symbols o and u originally represented one phoneme
with alternative pronunciations in specific environments (o word-finally). Due to the large
number of foreign loans in the language and high degree of bilingualism, however, these letters
now represent two contrastive vowel sounds, e.g. oso 'bear' vs. uso 'use, in fashion'.",[13]

mention), previous dictionaries, and a corpus of spoken Ilocano collected in various regions of the
Kailokuan. The dictionary used as the basic reference for the skeleton of this dictionary is Morice
Vanoverbergh's (1956) lloko-English Dictionary, which is the translated, augmented, and edited
edition of Rev. Andrés Cairo's (1888) Vocabulario lloco-Español. Words from ancient Ilocano texts
have also been included for use by Ilocanos and linguists alike interested in deciphering older materials.
Following is a list of linguistic and literature references used in compiling this edition of the
dictionary, as well as other basic references for those interested in Ilocano or basic Cordilleran topics.

"2. Nouns
I l o c a n o nouns m a y be classified into personal nouns and nonpersonal nouns based on their
morpho-syntactic behavior, the articles they take (see article section 3 . 1 ) , and their plural
formation. T h e y m a y also consist o f a simple root or a morphologically c o m p l e x derived form
(see section 2 . 3 ) .
Nouns m a y appear in discourse as predicate arguments, oblique referents, and even predicates. Postpredicate nominal slots are introduced b y determiners (articles or demonstratives).

In order to differentiate gender, the appositives a lalàki or a babài may be used to
designate masculinity or femininity respectively.

àding a babàiyounger brother
younger sisteranàk a lalàki
anàk a babàison
daughter2.3 Morphological formation of nouns—nominal derivation
So far I have outlined only simple noun roots. Ilocano has two ways of forming nominals. Any
lexeme in a nominal position (i.e., after an article or demonstrative) functions as a noun:
immay
dagiti immaycame
the ones who camenasingpet
ti nasingpetwell behaved, virtuous
the well-behaved personIlocano also has very productive derivational affixes that may nominalize a root that is
typically not substantival. I will list a few of the most common and useful of these prefixes here.","[47, 48]"

"BilabialstopsThe bilabial stops are /p/ (voiceless) and /b/ (voiced). They are unaspirated.
*Note: In the three columns below, the first column shows segments as they are spelled in Ilocano,
and the second column reflects the pronunciation in simplified IPA. The IPA pronunciation reflects
the dialect spoken in San Fernando, La Union, Philippines. In the northern dialects of Ilocos Norte
and Ilocos Sur, the high back unrounded vowel [ui] is pronounced as a mid front vowel [e],

touching the teeth. Like all stops in Ilocano, they are unaspirated and not released in final position.

The velar stops in Ilocano are /k/ (voiceless) and /g/ (voiced). They are never aspirated, and in final
position are usually unreleased. The voiceless stop / k j often fricates to /k""/ between vowels, or is
pronounced as a glottal stop [?] before consonants:

transparentstopThe glottal stop /?/ is produced with a quick closure and release in the glottal area. Due to the constraints of human anatomy, it is always voiceless. Vowel-initial words in Ilocano have the glottal
stop as their initial consonantal onset. For further discussion of the glottal stop, see section 4.

1.2 The fricatives
Ilocano has one native voiceless alveolar fricative [s], and a nonnative glottal fricative [h]. The
voiceless alveolar fricative is pronounced like the s in soda. Like the stops, it may geminate:
malas
susay
assawa
suso[ma:.las]
[su:.say]
[?as.sa:.wa]
[su.so]bad luck
species of fish
married couple
snailBefore the glide [y] or its counterpart (vowel i followed by another vowel), the fricative /s/
palatalizes to [J]:
siempre
siak
isyu[fern.pre]
[fak]
[?i:.ju]of course
I
issueThe glottal fricative [h] is not native to the Ilocano language and does not geminate. It often
appears in borrowings from languages like Spanish, English, Chinese, or Tagalog. The only native
word with a glottal fricative is haan 'no', a spoken variant of saan.
haan
ehe
husi[ha.?an]
[?e:.he]
[hu:.si]no
axle (f. Spanish)
pineapple fabric (f. Chinese)1.3 The affricates
Although there are no contrastive affricate consonants in Docano, affricates do occur in the language
as a result of palatalization in certain phonological environments or in foreign language borrowings.
The voiced alveo-palatal afficate [d3], like the English j in juice, is represented in the
orthography by dy or di + a vowel.
mandiak
dioga
dyus
dios[man.d3ak]
[d3o:.ga]
[d3iis]
[d30s]I don't
breast, slang
juice (f. English)
god (f. Spanish)The voiceless alveo-palatal affricate [tj~], like the English ch in China is represented in the
orthography by ts or ti + a vowel in borrowed words:
tsokolate
atsara
itsura
tianggi[tjb.ko.la:.te]
[?at.tja:.ra]
[?it.tjo:.ra]
[tjaij.gi]chocolate (f. Spanish)
pickles (f. Malay)
figure (f. Spanish)
store (f. Chinese)In native words, the alveo-palatal affricate [tj~] results from the palatalization of t occurring
before the glide y or its equivalent (vowel i followed by another vowel).
tian
agtiad[tjan]
[?ag.tjad]stomach

1.4 The liquids
Ilocano has two liquid consonants, M and IV. ftl is pronounced as a dental lateral in all environments.
It does not have a velarized variant like the English '1' in syllable-final position.
lalláki
agílo
nagádal[lal.lá:.ki]
[?a.gí:.lo]
[na.gá:.dal]boys

studiedThe consonant [r] is a dental tap pronounced like the Spanish r in araña. In careful speech,
it is often trilled like the Spanish rr of perro.
diário
agrugárog
naríri[d3á:.ryo]
[?ag.ru.gá:.rog]
[na.rí:.ri]newspaper
grunt
noisy; complaining1.5 The glides
Ilocano has two glides, /w/ and lyl. For their use in diphthongal codas, see section 2.1.
The labio-velar glide /w/ is formed with rounded lips and some obstruction at the velar part
of the mouth.
agbariwengwéng

high front vowel i.

shark1.6 The nasals
Ilocano has three nasal consonants, differentiated by the place of articulation in which the oral
airstream is blocked. The three nasals in Ilocano are /m/, /n/, and /ng/.
The bilabial nasal /m/ is formed by closing the airstream at the lips. It is equivalent to the
English m in mother.

bedThe dental nasal [n] is formed by obstructing the airflow in the mouth with the tongue
touching the upper teeth or the alveolar ridge slightly behind the upper teeth. It is equivalent to the
Spanish n in no.","[23, 24, 25, 26]"
