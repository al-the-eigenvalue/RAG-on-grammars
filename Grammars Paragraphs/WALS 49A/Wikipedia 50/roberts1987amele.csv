The S/R system is essentially a syntactic referential system
coreferencing the grammatical subject NP across clauses.
It
is not
influenced, for example, by a change in the semantic
role across
clauses
of
one
of
the
participants
in the
subject set
of
the marking clause.
The following examples
show a
change of semantic role across clauses of one of the
subject set participants in the marking clause from agent to
297MorphologyMorphologyrecipient in
one
case and from
agent
to
experiencer
in
another
case.
Also
a
change
across

NP's
from
experiencer to
recipient
is
given but in all instances of
change of
semantic role it is the syntactic contents of the
subject NP
that
is
tracked
and
marked
for SS since the
subject of
the controlling clause is either identical to or
a subset
of
the
subject
of the marking clause.
The fact
that one
of
the
participants
of
the
subject set of the
marking clause
has changed semantic role in the controlling
clause does
not
trigger
a DS
marking and in fact sucha
marking would be ungrammatical.

This

when

The phenomenon

In this construction clause 1 has a SS marking that does not
refer to
the immediately following clause, clause 2, but to
a more distant clause in the clause chain, clause 3, in this
case.
The subject coreferencing is therefore ""anomalous"" as

for
children
to

given
to
a
relative
to raise as their own child.
There appear to be a
number of reasons for this.
Sometimes it is to

obligation
to
a close relative, say a brother, and in this
case it is usually the firstborn child that is
given
away.
In
other
cases
it
may
be
that
the child has been bom
illegitimately or the parents have divorced or died or moved
away
to another area.
The child is given to a relative who
is willing to take it.
The term used for such
an
adoptive
arrangement
is
Uga ma utena. 'he gives him food'. In other
words the adopting relatives take on the
responsibility
of
raising
the
child and in all respects it becomes their own
child.
There is no special kinship terminology used for
an
adopted child however.
Sometimes a person may be taken into

a Subject

also a

Another way of

It is argued in this thesis, however,
that
these
are
not
incidents of clause skipping as diagrammed above; rather the
marking clause coreferences the immediately following clause
as
SS
when
syntactically
it
is
a change
of
subject.
Firstly, while it is most
common
in
text
to
find
these
incidents
of
anomalous
SS marking in a clause chain where
there is a third clause
for
the
reference
of
the
first
clause
to
skip down to, occasionally instances occur where
there is no third clause, as in
the
examples
given.
The
second
clause
occurs
as the final clause of the sentence.
Therefore the first clause must be coreferencing the
second
clause
directly
as
SS.
Secondly
if
the S/R marking is
""corrected"" on the first clause and it is made DS then
this
produces a different meaning as given below.
