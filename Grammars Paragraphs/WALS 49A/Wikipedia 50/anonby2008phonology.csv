"A final section provides anChapter 6, which is concerned with pronouns, is an appropriate transition between
chapter 5 on nouns and chapter 7, which is concerned with verbs. While, prototypically,
pronouns take the place of nominal referents, they also play an important role in the
verbal system, where they bear TAM (tense, aspect and mode) distinctions. The larger
part of the chapter is concerned with the basic categories of personal pronouns
distinguished in Mambay: subject, object and possessive pronouns. Each of these
pronoun types also has emphatic forms produced by various strategies. A final section
deals with interrogative pronouns.
Chapter 7 examines verbs. First, canonical morphologically simple stems are examined.
This is followed by a discussion of non-canonical stems, most of which are
morphologically complex; the most prominent group of non-canonical stems contain
verbal extensions. A description of verb word morphology then leads into a discussion of
verbal inflection, which is marked on the verb word, subject pronouns and by means of
expanded verb forms, including those which incorporate auxiliary verbs and TAM
adverbs and particles. A final section describes composite verbal expressions: these are
constructions composed of a verb stem recurrently found with another element (noun,
prepositional phrase, etc.) in the lexicon.
Chapter 8 deals with two classes of modifiers: adverbs and adjectives. Since ideophones
comprise a majority of adverbs as well as adjectives, they are also treated in this chapter
as a parallel topic with major implications for both of these word classes. One striking
trait of ideophones in Mambay is the existence of several derivational ideophonic
templates. Apart from ideophones, directional and TAM adverbs as well as a poorly
defined group of non-ideophonic adjectives are addressed.
Chapter 9 brings together three minor word classes, all of which are closed in the lexicon:
numerals, demonstratives and prepositions. Numerals in particular are morphologically
diverse; a small group of underived numerals is found, but many numerals are derived
from other parts of speech, especially nouns.
Chapter 10 serves to introduce the structure of clauses and clause combinations. The
section on clause structure, which comes first, deals with constituent order, clause and
clause constituent particles and verbless clauses; independent utterances other than
clauses are also considered. The section on clause combinations then concentrates on
strategies of coordination and subordination, giving special attention to conjunctions and
particles.
At the end of this study, a collection of five texts is transcribed and interlinearized. These
texts have been selected from a variety of genres—song, proverb, legend (account of
origins), and fable—in order to illustrate a range of morphological, syntactic and
discourse structures. In addition, there are two appendices: Appendix 1 provides an27inventory of inalienable possession paradigms, and Appendix 2 presents conjugations of
verbal inflection as it patterns with contrastive tonal verb classes.
One theme that is recurrently invoked in the description is that of canonicity.
Phonological structures from some of the word classes fall between two ends of a
continuum: canonical and non-canonical.
Canonical structures belong to the
homogeneous phonological core of the language and represent the vast majority of
structures in the language. However, there are small but persistent groups of marked and
highly varied structures in all of the lexically open word classes; and often, non-canonical
roots exhibit a cluster of uncommon features. The sections which discuss canonicity
reveal that some non-canonical structures, such as nasalized mid vowels (3.1.1), are
attested only a handful of times in the data. Words borrowed from other languages
usually exhibit the same behaviour as other non-canonical items in the same class (e.g.,
5.2.2.3, 7.1.2.3). In later chapters, canonicity is considered in reference to the following
topics:
- geminate consonants (2.1.2.7);
- repetition of consonants within a syllable (2.1.2.8);
- distribution of vowels within morphemes (2.2.2.3);
- syllable weight (2.4.3);
- inventory of nasalized vowels (3.1);
- noun CV structure (5.2.1.1) and tone melody (5.1.1.2);
- noun-to-noun derivation with prefixes (5.1.2.3.1);
- linked form (5.2.2.2) and plurality (5.5.1.1) templates;
- verb stem structure (7.1);
- ideophones (8.2; see also 5.11 and 7.1.2.2); and
- prepositions vs. locational nouns (9.3.3).
The Fulfulde examples given in the text have been verified using SIL (2003) and Noye
(1974), and Hausa examples are from Abraham and Mai Kano (1949) and Maarten
Kossmann (pers. comm. 2007).","[44, 45]"

TONE AND INTONATION
4TONE AND INTONATIONLike the vast majority of Niger-Congo languages, Mambay is tonal. All syllables in all
utterances are affected by tone, and its behaviour in the language is systematic.
In the context of a rich inventory of consonants, vowels, syllable and word shapes, and
contrastive nasality (Chapters 2 and 3), the functional load of tone in distinguishing
lexical items within word classes is moderate, and minimal tone pairs within classes are
surprisingly uncommon. However, its role in the language is much broader than this.
Among other things, tone is an important means of distinguishing among word classes
(4.1.2.4). In addition, tone plays a central role in the verbal system, where it is used as a
basic means of TAM (tense/aspect/mode) marking (7.3.2.2). Further, tone is sensitive to
boundaries of phonological phrases (4.3); the resulting limitation of tonal processes in
phrase-final position helps provide pragmatic coherence and contrast in discourse.
Two contrastive tone levels are found in Mambay: H (high) and L (low). Tones from
these two levels are organized into contrastive tone melodies and associated with
morphemes or, in some cases, phonological words (4.1).
Additional structural aspects of the tone system include floating tones, replacive tone
melodies, and interaction between tone and other phonological structures (4.2).
Four major processes affect the tone system. While tone deletion is a lexical process,
postlexical processes consist of downstep, H tone spread and L tone spread (4.3).
In addition to a complete tonal system, two important intonational phenomena are
attested in Mambay: tone register shift (which is different than downstep) and an
expectation marker. Both interact closely with the tone system (4.4).
Terminology and transcription
Whenever phonologically contrastive tonal elements are under discussion, the terms
“tone” and “tone melody” are used. In contrast, the term “pitch” is limited to phonetic
descriptions of tonal realizations.
Regarding the transcription of tone, several comments are in order. For typographical
reasons, the phonological orthography used in this study consistently limits tone marking
to orthographic vowels; the tone marked on vowels is thus applicable to the whole118syllable. This convention is pertinent for syllables with a VC coda, which have two tonebearing units (2.4.3). In cases where the tonal value of the coda C is different than that of
the preceding V, it is transcribed on the V as follows:
underlying
simplified
phonological phonological
form
orthographyexample/ká7`/
/kùmi/bowstring, drum snare
baobabkâ7
kuFmThis convention also applies to pharyngealized and glottalized vowels (whether
phonologically long or short; see 2.2.1, 2.3.3.2–3), which are represented with Vh and V’
in the phonological orthography.

The basic inflectional categories in Mambay are marked by length and tone on subject
pronouns (6.1.2) and tone on verb words (see 7.3.2.2 as well this section below).
Mambay verb forms may be divided into Indicative (7.4.1) and Optative (7.4.2) moods.
The clear majority of verb forms are Indicative, and are further subdivided according to
realis value, aspect, and tense.8 Optative forms, in contrast, do not reflect these
distinctions. This basic verb system may be schematized as follows:
Functions of basic verbal inflection in Mambay
mood
Indicativerealis value
RealisaspecttensePerfectivePerfective (basic)
Perfect
PluperfectImperfective
IrrealisFutureOptative
Indicative verb forms are used to express events (7.4.1). Optative verb forms, in contrast,
are used to express a speaker’s wishes, to express purpose in dependent clauses, and to
express the effect of causation (7.4.2). Formally, the classification of Indicative vs.
Optative mood corresponds to the use of the negation particles yá and gá (7.5.2)
respectively. In addition, Indicative verb forms are inflected for realis value, aspect, and
tense.
Indicative verb forms are specified for Realis and Irrealis values. In contrast to Optative
forms, which are inherently irrealis and not marked for realis distinction, Indicative
Realis (7.4.1.1) and Irrealis (7.4.1.2) forms are distinguished. Formally, this distinction is
marked on the subject pronoun: Realis pronouns are short (CV), and Irrealis pronouns are
long (CVV) (6.1.2). While Realis forms signal events which have happened or are
happening, Irrealis forms signal events that have not already happened and which are not
8In the present study, as has been common in the study of Niger-Congo generally, the term “tense” is
understood in a traditional sense: “any one of the different forms or modifications (or word-groups) in the
conjugation of a verb which indicate the different times (past, present, or future) at which the action or
state denoted by it is viewed as happening or existing, and also (by extension) the different nature of such
action or state, as continuing (imperfect) or completed (perfect)” (Oxford English Dictionary online 2007;
cf. Doke 1935:209, Dimmendaal 2000:162 and Crystal 2003:459–60). This differs from the use of the term
in Comrie (1976) and, subsequently, much of the literature (e.g. Lyons 1995:312 ff.), where event sequence
(“tense”) and the internal structure of events (“aspect”) are treated as distinct categories of verb
modification. In Mambay, there is no formal justification for such a distinction.","[355, 356]"
"6.1 Personal pronouns
In Mambay, thirteen pronoun slots are grammaticalized based on person, number and
related values (6.1.1). Pronouns are used to mark subjects (6.1.2), objects (6.1.3) and
possessors (6.1.4). Each category of personal pronoun is found with a corresponding set
of emphatic pronouns (6.1.5).

Mambay: first-and-second (6.1.1.1); impersonal (6.1.1.2); generic (6.1.1.3); and coreference (6.1.1.4).
Instances of formal redundancy between some of the slots are summarized in 6.1.1.5. In
particular, the third person generic (omitted in the main chart on the previous page; see
6.1.1.3) and third person impersonal slots are marginal, since in most cases they share the
form of other third person pronouns. Taking this into account, the basic pronoun system
of Mambay may be schematized as follows:
The basic pronoun system of Mambay

First-and-second (1&2) person pronouns are “inclusive,” that is, they involve (at least) a
speaker and an addressee. Mambay stands apart from most closely related languages and
other languages in the region not in that it has inclusive pronouns, but in that this slot is
distinguished for “singular” and plural (Duru / Yag Dii in north-central Cameroon also
exhibits this system; see Bohnhoff 1986:104). 1&2 singular pronouns refer to the
minimal communication dyad, namely, a speaker and an addressee.

1&2SG.POSSour (your (sg.) and my) stoolFrom a numeric point of view, these pronouns are dual rather than singular. However, in
the pronominal system, they pattern as singular by virtue of a grammaticalized opposition
to the 1&2 plural pronouns (cf. Thomas 1955:207–8, Corbett 2000:166–9, Cysouw
2003:85–90, 260–4 and 2005:5). 1&2 plural pronouns refer to a communication dyad
with a speaker, an addressee, and at least one other participant. The “other(s)” may be
aligned with either the speaker or the addressee.

1&2PL.POSSour (your and our / your (pl.) and my) stoolIn the above examples, it is evident that the form of the 1&2 singular is similar to that of
the plural (this is also the case in Duru; see Bohnhoff 1986:104, 129 footnote 3). In fact,
for verbal subject pronouns, 1&2 singular and plural forms are identical; the singular vs.
plural distinction is instead formalized on verbs through the use of the verbal plurality
affix 4zí (7.3.1.1) and singular vs. plural reflexive suffixes (7.3.1.2) on verb stems.

contains a morpheme with the consonant z. This underlines the 1&2 plural’s formal
alignment with other explicit plural marking in the language, which is also typically
found with z (5.5, 5.9.2.1, 7.3.1.1).
An alternative presentation of the same system using the more familiar distinctions of
inclusive vs. exclusive and singular vs. dual vs. plural has also been considered. In such
a presentation, the 1&2 singular slot shown above would be labelled “first person
inclusive dual” and the 1&2 plural slot would be labelled “first person inclusive plural”;
also—and importantly—the first person plural slot described in this study would be recast
as “first person exclusive plural.” Such a description is provided for a parallel system in
Margi (a Chadic language of Nigeria) by Hoffman (1963:72ff.). The two presentations
may be compared as follows:

1PL.EXCL2SG2PL2SG2PL1&2SG1&2PL3SG3PL3SG3PL3SG.COREF3PL.COREF3SG.COREF3PL.COREFThe latter presentation, which relies on more familiar distinctions, falls short in that it sets
up a dual vs. plural opposition, even though a “dual” category is not grammaticalized
elsewhere in the Mambay pronoun system (or anywhere in the language, for that matter;
see Thomas 1955:205, Plank 1996 and Cysouw 2003:87–8). In contrast, the presentation
with 1&2SG/PL slots recognizes a communication dyad as a basic person category; as
such, it brings out symmetry in the applicability of plurality to 1&2 person pronouns and
inherently singular pronouns (Greenberg 1988:3–4). The semantic confusion that arises
from the labelling of a “you-and-I” (i.e., 1&2SG) pronoun as singular can be addressed by
considering this pronoun, along with the inherently singular pronouns, as “minimal”;
remaining pronouns could be considered “augmented,” since they all involve the addition
of “other” persons to “minimal” slots (Bohnhoff 1986:104, Beavon 1986:175, Corbett
2000:199–9, Cysouw 2003:85–90, 2005:5).","[272, 273, 274, 275, 276]"
"5.4.2 Morphological constitution
Most compound nouns are composed of the linked form of one noun (5.3.3.3.1) followed
by the free (unmarked) form of another noun.
nàm kúù
wild animal
animal:LF bushland
sààrì tú ò
blood vessel
sinew:LF blood
As stated above, such compounds are formally equivalent to spontaneous possessive
constructions (5.3.3.1). Attested variations on the prototypical noun + noun compound
construction are as follows:
- three- and four-noun compounds (5.4.2.1);
- noun + numeral compounds (5.4.2.2);
- compounds containing prepositional phrases (5.4.2.3);
- clausal compounds (5.4.2.4);
197- compounds containing proper names (5.4.2.5); and
- nouns exhibiting reduplication (5.4.2.6).
Examples of compound nouns representing each of these structures are given in the
following paragraphs, and formally equivalent constructions are noted when they occur.
5.4.2.1 Three- and four-noun compounds
Some compounds are composed of three or even four nouns. In each case, these nouns
are internally organized such that one of the nouns in the construction is itself a
compound noun and/or a possessive construction. Examples of three-noun compounds
are as follows:
káà [và’zì dágà]
head:LF leaf:LF mouthlip (cf. và’zì dágà ‘lip area’)vbíílì [káà wáà]
drum:LF head:LF chiefdrum sp. (cf. káà wáà ‘chief (respect form)’)Four-noun compounds include the following:
nàm [[dâg tèNn] bà7gè]
gazelle sp. (cf. dâg tèNnú ‘bottom of the rib’)
animal:LF mouth:LF side(body):LF rust.colour
tí7gì [fàà [Nmàh zaFh]]
monitor lizard sp.
monitor.lizard:LF back:LF foot:LF ox
As these examples suggest, embedded compound nouns are more commonly found in the
possessor position rather than the possessed position of three- and four-noun compounds.
As is the case for spontaneous possessive constructions, which are formally equivalent,
the internal formal structure of the compound is ambiguous (cf. 5.3.2). For example, if
such a referential context were possible, nàm dâg tèNn bà7gè could also be understood
to mean ‘animal of mouth/edge of side of rust-colour.’
5.4.2.2 Noun + numeral compounds
Other compound nouns contain a numeral (9.1) as a dependent element.
hèègì dâg àt
knife:LF mouth:LF twocircumcision knife, scissorstòh dâg àt
snake:LF mouth:LF twosnake sp.vbîz bóm
fishhook:LF onefishing line198These compounds are formally equivalent to count constructions in which the head noun
is definite (5.14.3, 9.1.1.1). For example, depending on the referential context, vbîz bóm
may also be understood to mean ‘the one fishhook.’
5.4.2.3 Compounds containing prepositional phrases
A few compound nouns in the data contain or are comprised of prepositional phrases
(9.3):
páà bèè káálà
man:LF without headstupid personsáà dwaF’
inside bellywombThe prepositional phrases in these compounds are formally equivalent to normal
prepositional phrases (9.3.1). For example, depending on the referential context, sáà
dwaF’ may also be understood to mean ‘inside the belly.’
5.4.2.4 Clausal compounds
A number of compounds consist of combined clause elements. Minimally, there is a
subject and a predicate (most often represented by a pronoun and a conjugated verb
respectively). As shown by the example below, other components may include objects,
negation clitics, locative complements and clitics, and adverbial ideophones.

"4.4.2 The expectation marker m
The expectation marker (here symbolized as m ) is a non-segmental morpheme which
raises the pitch of a phrase-final mora. Although its phonological identity may initially
seem unclear, evidence suggests that like TRS (4.4.1), it is intonational rather than tonal
(4.4.2.2). It has three important roles in the cohesion of text, all of which broadly relate
to expectancy in a discourse: topicalization, the signalling of an incomplete utterance, and
rhetorical question marking (4.4.2.3).
4.4.2.1 Phonetic realizations
The expectation marker has the consistent effect of raising the register of a phrase-final
mora. When it links to a L-toned mora, this mora is realized with a high pitch equivalent
to that of an (actual or hypothetical) preceding H-toned mora; and when it links to a Htoned mora, the mora is realized with a super-high pitch several intervals (4.1.1) above
the baseline realization of the H-toned mora.

EXPECTm

bushland, …(cf. 4.4.2.3)[nàmh zá]

Phonologically, the expectation marker displays behaviour characteristic of both tone and
intonation. Its confinement to a single mora as well as its phonetically consistent effect
on pitch (4.4.2.1) are occurrences one might expect of a tonal element.
However, there is evidence that the expectation marker is essentially intonational. As
the examples in the preceding section show, the expectation marker may attach to and be
realized in words for which each TBU is already associated with a tone.
Because it does not require its own mora to be realized, it is necessary to address the
possibility that the expectation marker might be a replacive tone. However, the mora to
which it links continues to reflect the relative pitch of the underlying tone (the pitch of
raised L is still a consistent interval lower than raised H; see the examples immediately
above and 4.3.2.1). In this respect, the expectation marker functions intonationally rather
than tonally.
4.4.2.3 Pragmatic functions
The expectation marker has three important roles in the cohesion of text, all of which
broadly relate to expectancy in a discourse: topicalization (cf. 10.1.2.4), floor-holding (cf.
10.1.2.4), and rhetorical question marking (cf. 10.1.2.1). An example of each role is as
follows:148topicalization:

NOUNS
5NOUNSThis chapter is a description of nouns in Mambay. The first major section (5.1) outlines
the morphological structure of nouns. In particular, noun roots are presented in reference
to attested root shapes and allowable tone melodies. Prefixation is then analyzed as a
morphologically salient process involving a mixture of compounding and derivation.
Suffixation, in contrast, is referred to as a primarily derivational process which, although
it has significantly impacted noun structure, is synchronically unproductive and
morphologically indistinct. Reduplication, a minor phenomenon in regard to nouns, is
mentioned briefly.
A second major section (5.2) deals with a basic morphological distinction between free
(unmarked) and linked noun forms. Linked forms, which are subject to various
morphological templates depending on the structure of their free form, are used for head
nouns in most noun phrase constructions. Following this, a section on possessive
constructions (5.3) complements the discussion, since both free and linked forms are used
in this context. The description of possessive constructions, which are the most
important type of noun phrase construction in the language, revolves around three axes.
First of all, a continuum between spontaneous and fixed possession is established. The
issue of optional vs. obligatory possession is then considered. The greatest part of the
discussion, however, deals with the distributional and structural characteristics of
alienable vs. inalienable possession. A section on compound nouns (5.4) follows
naturally on that of possessive constructions, since most compound nouns are structured
in the same way. Formal and behavioural particularities of compound nouns are also
accounted for.
Plural formation, which comprises an additional topic (5.5), is achieved by means of a
loosely defined morphological template. In this section, the scope of pluralization is
delimited, and a range of possible structural alternations is recognized. Collective
constructions, which constitute an alternative plural-like strategy for some nouns, are also
considered (5.6).
In subsequent sections, four derivational topics are considered: participant noun
constructions (5.7), diminutives and augmentatives (5.8), verbal nouns (5.9) and the
promotion of modifiers to independent noun status (5.10). A mixture of derivational
strategies, including but not limited to affixation, is common to all four phenomena. For
verbal nouns in particular, complications in determining the direction of derivation are150acknowledged. Ordinal numerals, which constitute a closed category of nouns derived
from numerals, are dealt with in the presentation on numerals (9.1.3).
In later sections, ideophonic nouns (5.11) and proper names (5.12) are given special
attention, and the locative function of nouns is delineated in 5.13. In the final section, an
overview of noun phrase constructions is provided (5.14).","[165, 166, 167, 168]"

beginning of 5.12.1) that are identical, place names (cf. 5.12.3) are frequently used to
disambiguate between the two people.

and three of the names contain an obligatory prefix. Two of the clan names appear to be
compound nouns. While most of the names are semantically opaque, the meaning and/or
source of some of them may be determined.
Rather than plurals, the collective prefix tì4 (5.6.1) is used with clan names.

Some of these names include:

As is the case for prepositions (9.3), nouns may be used to indicate location (for formal
differences between the two word classes, see 9.3.3). Like objects of transitive verbs
(7.3.2.1.2), nouns functioning locatively are morphologically unmarked complements
which follow a verb.
Ø yàà fíílò
3:PFV stay:PFV house
cf. Ø kó fíílò
3:PFV see:PFV househe/she/it stayed at the house
he/she/it saw the house250Importantly, and similar to what is found in Mundang and some related languages (Elders
2000:253–4, Welmers 1973:216–7; cf. Ruelland 1992:230–1), there is no formal
difference between the two following a transitive verb. This may lead to ambiguity
which is only resolved in the referential realm, as the following example shows:
Ø làà4rì túrà
3:PFV eat:PERF-PERF millethe/she/it has eaten millet / he/she/it has eaten
at the millet (i.e., among the millet plants)When an object and locational complement are found in the same clause, the object
comes first.
Ø làà túrà )áà
3:PFV eat:PFV millet beanshe/she/it has eaten millet among the bean plantsØ làà )áà túrà
3:PFV eat:PFV beans millethe/she/it has eaten beans among the millet plantsAlthough a wide range of nouns could be used in a locative function, three categories in
particular are commonly used: locations in the referential realm, inherently locative
nouns, and body parts used in a locative capacity.
Examples of locations in the referential realm (see also 5.12.3) are as follows:
bèè kàhbí

3:PFV stay:PFV here thishe/she/it stayed right hereThat these words are nouns rather than prepositions is proven by their compatibility with
dependent noun phrase elements such as possessor nouns, possessive pronouns and
specifiers. This is shown in the example sentences above.
Body parts commonly used in a locative capacity are as follows:

5.3.3.3.1). The possessor may be a noun or an inalienable possessive pronoun (cf.
5.3.4.2.2).

Noun phrases are constructions involving a head noun and, potentially, additional
elements. Like clauses (10.1.1) and prepositional phrases (9.3), noun phrases are leftheaded in Mambay. The following noun phrase constructions are used commonly:
noun + noun (including possessive pronouns and noun phrases)
noun + adjective
noun + numeral
noun + specifier
noun + prepositional phrase
noun + relative clause
In the subsections below, examples of these constructions are provided.","[265, 266, 267, 268, 269, 270]"
"5.9.1True verbal nounsTrue verbal nouns (henceforth referred to simply as verbal nouns) exhibit characteristics
of nouns as well as verbs (Chapter 7). They are semantically predictable in that they
minimally refer to a verbal action or state which is brought about by the subject (whether
agent or another role) (cf. fossilized verbal nouns; see 5.9.2).

with similar semantic values (ex. 5.3.3.3.1, 5.5). For example, they may be possessed
(5.3.2).

hú%òpossessed form
hû% )íí
my dying/death
die:VN 1SG.POSSdying, deathhû% nàmá
die:VN animalanimal’s dying/deathStructurally, verbal nouns pattern with nouns in that they are minimally comprised of a
heavy syllable or two light syllables; this contrasts with verbs, since in the data there are
fifteen examples of verb roots comprised of a light syllable. In fact, a compensatory g is
inserted for verbal nouns derived from verb roots comprised of a light syllable (2.4.3,
7.1.1):
verbal noun
dòg
pàgverb stem
dó
pádrinking

doHowever, verbal nouns also exhibit some characteristics of verbs. By definition, all
verbal nouns correspond to finite verb roots, with which they are found in derivational
relationship. While complexities of derivation are discussed in the sections devoted to
each type of verbal noun (5.9.1.1 and 5.9.1.2), some general observations underline the
verb-like behaviour of verbal nouns. Importantly, verbal nouns are used in the Mambay
verbal system, where with subject pronouns they express the verbal function of the
Imperfective (7.4.1.1.2). A comparable situation is found in the well-known case of
Hausa (Dimmendaal 2000:171, Newman 2000:288–92) and in Kebi-Benue languages
such as Mundang (Elders 2000:327–30).

Adverbial functions, including those which are locational, are not restricted to
prepositions. In fact, nouns and directional adverbs are more commonly used to express428location (together with direction) than are prepositions. In addition, a number of high
frequency verbs express such information.
In Mambay, there are several types of locational nouns (this is described in greater detail
in 5.13). Most locational nouns pattern like prepositions in that they require a dependent
element to follow when they are used locatively (otherwise, they may stand alone). For
locational nouns, however, the dependent element is a possessor noun or possessive
pronoun rather than a complement (9.3.1).
nîn

eye/in.presence:LF sunin the sun (cf. nínù ‘eye, face, life’)nílé
in his/her/its (coref.) presence / in its presence
eye/in.presence:3COREF/IMPERS.POSS.INAL
The locational sense is an extension of the central meaning of a noun (usually a body
part), and there is no structural contrast between the two senses (5.13). There are, in
contrast, no non-locational nouns corresponding to true prepositions. As Hagège
(1975:155–6) points out in the context of the Kebi-Benue languages, these differences are
sufficient to treat locational nouns and prepositions as belonging to separate grammatical
classes.
Remaining locational nouns (5.13) are not derived from corresponding non-locative
nouns but fail to conform to the distributional criteria for prepositions in at least one of
two ways. First, like the locational nouns above, some have discrete linked forms (5.2.2)
and/or may be found with possessor nouns (5.3.2) and possessive pronouns (6.1.4) rather
than complements (as shown in 9.3.1 above).

toward:LF)ánzá
1&2PL.POSSthe place where we (incl.) come fromgâh
midst:LF)óró
2PL.POSSyour (pl.) midstSecond, a few locational nouns without a corresponding non-locative sense may be found
without any following dependent element. Examples of such nouns are:
fà4gbàh7
kaF’
kuFF’
là íoutside
here (i.e., this place)
there (i.e., that place)
left side429Locational nouns also show minor structural differences from prepositions. For one
thing, a noun’s minimal shape is a heavy syllable (5.1.1.1) rather than a light syllable (cf.
9.3), and may exceed one syllable (5.1.1.1). Also, attested tone melodies of prepositions
are more often than not H or L, unlike the usual HL or LH melody of canonical nouns
(5.1.1.2).
Like prepositions, directional adverbs (8.1.1) are also used to express locative concepts.
However, they differ from prepositions in that they may not themselves take a
complement (cf. 9.3.1), and in that they are always found with a verb.

"7.6.3 Complex inflectional constructions
There are two kinds of complex inflectional constructions: serial verb constructions
(7.6.3.1) and verbal constructions formed by means of auxiliaries (7.6.3.2).
7.6.3.1 Serial verb constructions
Two types of serial verb constructions are commonly attested in Mambay: these have
been labelled Realis Future 2 and Imperfective Progressive 2.
Realis Future 2
In Realis Future 2 constructions, two finite verbs are found together, and there is no
independent person marking on the second finite verb (as per the typical serial verb
constructions described in Payne 1997:308).
Structure: various forms of vè ‘go’ + Perfective verb word
mì
1SGvè
go:PFVtè’
walk:PFVI was going to walknà
1&2vè4zí
go:PFV-PLtè’
walk:PFVwe (incl.) were going to walkImperfective Progressive 2
Structure: optional Realis pronoun + tògó ‘be’ (7.3.3.3) + Imperfective
ex. (mì) toFg mì té’là
1SG be 1SG walk:VNI am walking / I am in the
process of walkingThe optional nature of the subject pronoun with tògó ‘be’ shows that two discrete types
of constructions are used to express the Imperfective Progressive 2. When tògó is found
with its own subject pronoun, the Imperfective Progressive 2 is a serial verb construction.
Evidence for its identity as a serial verb construction rather than an instance of juxtaposed
clauses comes from two directions: first, the subject of both tògó ‘be’ (when it is used)
and the subject of the following Imperfective verb form must be identical; and second,369tògó appears in the Imperfective Progressive 2 as toFg, which is its phrase-internal
realization (cf. its phrase-final realization; see 7.3.3.3; also cf. Payne 1997:308–9).
The optional nature of the subject pronoun with tògó ‘be’ suggests that tògó is in the
process of being grammaticalized as a TAM adverb (7.6.1.2) with progressive meaning.
7.6.3.2 Constructions with auxiliaries
A variety of complex inflectional constructions employ auxiliaries, that is, verbs which
are head of the verb phrase but which do not embody the main activity expressed by the
clause (Payne 1997:84). In addition, the examples below show that auxiliaries express a
meaning that is not fully compositional, that is, one which differs from the meaning
found when the same verb does embody a clause’s main activity.
When an auxiliary is used in Mambay, the main activity or state is expressed as an object
or adverbial complement of the auxiliary. Formally, there are two major types of
constructions with auxiliaries: those followed by verbal nouns (7.6.3.2.1), and those
followed by subordinate clauses (7.6.3.2.2).
7.6.3.2.1 Auxiliaries followed by verbal nouns
Most auxiliaries are followed by verbal nouns, which express the central event or state of
a clause. This given, there are three positions in which the verbal noun accompanying an
auxiliary may be found:
1. on its own;
mì
1SG%áá
find:PFVté’là
walk:VNI was able to walk2. prefixed with kì4 ‘place, time, situation’ (5.1.2.4.5);
mì
1SG)èr
get.up:PFVkì4té’là
place:PFX-walk:VNI was just walking3. as a complement of a preposition (cf. 9.3)
mì
1SGtìì
become:PFVmá
withté’là
walk:VNI walk (habitually) /
I walked (habitually)As is evident from the first and second examples here, the distribution of a verbal noun
vs. a verbal noun prefixed with kì4 does not appear to be semantically significant.
However, in most cases a given auxiliary is syntactically limited to one of the two
strategies; the reasons for the choice of one form over another are not clear. Both are
found with intransitive as well as intransitive verbs, so based on transitivity requirements
established elsewhere in the language (7.3.2.1), verbal nouns (with or without kì4) must
be viewed variously as adverbial complements (with intransitive auxiliaries) or objects
(with transitive auxiliaries).
370The inflectional categories expressed by constructions have been organized according to
form and labelled according to their function as follows:
- Habitual
- Potential
- Realis Future 3
- Recent Past
- Past-Imperfective 1
- Future-Imperfective 1
- Past-Imperfective 2
- Future-Imperfective 2
The structure and function of these forms is described below, and a chart summarizing
the structure of all the forms is found at the end of this section.

Usually, as in the above examples, plurality is not marked explicitly on a noun which is
modified by a numeral. However, it may be marked. This occurs more commonly with
human nouns (5.5.1.3).

In addition to their other functions, numbers may also be used in an absolute way. In
contexts which use mathematical operations—for example, school, counting games and
the calculation of money—numbers relate to one another rather than to a syntactic head.
In cases where both short and long forms are found (cf. 9.1), short forms rather than long
forms are used for mathematical operations.

7.4.1.1.1.2 Perfect
The Perfect tense is used for previously completed events with consequences for a point
in time contemporaneous with the sequence of events in a discourse (typically the
present). It is structured differently for intransitive and transitive verbs. For intransitive
verbs and detransitivized transitive verbs (7.3.2.1), reflexive suffixes are used:
subject pronoun +verbRealis pronoun (CV) stem (Perfect tone (see 7.3.2.2.3)) + reflexive suffix
ex. mì hèè4ní
I have climbed
1SG climb:PERF-1SG.REFL
rò hèè4ró
you (pl.) have climbed
2PL climb:PERF-REFL-2PL.REFL343For typical transitive verbs, a Perfect suffix 4rì (7.3.1.3) is used:
subject pronoun +verbRealis pronoun (CV) stem (Perfect tone) + 4rì
ex. mì làà4rì
1SG eat:PERF-PERF)ígà
thingI have eaten somethingrò làà4rì
2PL eat:PERF-PERF)ígà
thingyou (pl.) have eaten somethingAs is the case with the basic Perfective (7.4.1.1.1.1) and Pluperfect (7.4.1.1.1.3), third
person singular and plural forms (excluding co-referential forms) of the Perfect are
marked with a zero pronoun.

stem and a H suffix; * = replacive melody, i.e., dominates the entire verb word; see
7.3.2.2.3.)
Full paradigms are given for each class in Appendix 2. As is evident, the tonal nature of
Perfect forms in some tonal classes is complex: while Class 1 (CVX intransitive only)
and Class 2 exhibit a floating H tone on the left boundary of the verb word, some other
Classes (4, transitive only; 5; and 6) exhibit a replacive melody that applies to the Perfect
verb word as a whole. The tonal behaviour of these forms is reviewed in 7.3.2.2.3.
There is no negative form of the Perfect; negated Perfect constructions use negative
perfective forms (7.5.1).
7.4.1.1.1.3 Pluperfect
The Pluperfect tense is used for previously completed events with consequences for a
point in time subsequent to the event but prior to the point of reference in a discourse.
The Pluperfect is found with intransitive verbs as well as transitive verbs that take
reflexive suffixes (7.3.1.2). It is typically structured as follows:
subject pronoun +verbIndicative pronoun (CV) stem (Pluperfect tone) + reflexive suffix
ex. mì Qáá4ní
I had moved away
1SG move.away:PLUPERF-1SG.REFL

mì Qáà4ní
I have moved away
1SG move.away:PERF-1SG.REFL
rò Qáà4ró
you (pl.) have moved away
2PL move.away:PERF-2PL.REFL
As is the case with the basic Perfective (7.4.1.1.1.1) and Perfect (7.4.1.1.1.2), third person
singular and plural forms (excluding co-referential forms) of the Perfect are marked with
a zero pronoun.

are discussed in 7.5.
7.4.1.1.2 Imperfective
The Imperfective is used for events which, in reference to a given point in time, happen
but are not completed. In addition to carrying a generic imperfective meaning, it often
communicates a habitual meaning. Usually the events are anchored in the present, but as
the example at the end of this section shows, they may be expressed as events in the past.
Represented by a single tense, the Imperfective is typically expressed simply by using a
Realis subject pronoun (6.1.2) with a verbal noun (5.9). As is explained in the section on
verbal nouns, a comparable situation is found in the well-known case of Hausa
(Dimmendaal 2000:171, Newman 2000:288–92) and in Kebi-Benue languages such as
Mundang (Elders 2000:327–30).","[359, 360, 361, 362, 363]"
"5.14.1 Noun + noun
Noun + noun phrases, described here as possessive constructions, are the most common
type of noun phrase in Mambay (5.3). They are composed of a possessed head noun
followed by a dependent possessor. While the possessed noun exhibits a linked form
(5.2.1), the possessor’s form is free (i.e., unmarked).

PRONOUNS
6PRONOUNSBecause pronouns play a major role in verbal inflection (cf. 7.4), the description of
pronouns in Mambay provides a suitable transition between the description of nouns
(Chapter 5) and that of verbs (Chapter 7). Most of the present chapter is devoted to the
cataloguing and description of personal pronouns (6.1), and a final section (6.2) presents
interrogative pronouns.","[270, 271, 272]"
"7.4.2 Optative
The Optative mood is attested in three contexts. In main clauses, a general Optative
function prevails; prototypically, it communicates an imperative intention (7.4.2.1). It is
also found in subjunctive constructions following the subordinating conjunction kà
(7.4.2.2), and in subjunctive constructions formed with the causative auxiliary pá ‘make,
do’ (7.4.2.3). Negative forms of the Optative are discussed in 7.5.
7.4.2.1 In main clauses
Optative verb forms are most commonly found in main clauses. In this context, a general
Optative function applies, expressing a wish on the part of the speaker.
Typologically, Mambay stands out in that it has no verb form marked specifically for an
imperative function. Instead, Optative verb forms in main clauses prototypically
communicate an imperative intention—the idea that a member or members of an
audience must do something (cf. Bybee 1985:171, Payne 1997:303, Crystal 2003:227,
Palmer 2001:80). Most frequently, this audience is the second person (singular or plural),
and the illocutionary force is that of a command (“you…!, you must….”).
However, in Mambay the audience of a command may also be the first or the third person
(sample descriptions for which an imperative function has been described for all
pronominal persons are Robertson 1934:320–30, Lakoff 1968:172–6; Roberts 1990:369
and Mounce 1994:143–8; cf. also Palmer 2001:81, who discusses the theoretical352implications of such a system). For forms in which the first person is a speaker, orders
are given to oneself (the first person singular) or a group of which one is a part (first
person plural and 1&2 person forms); for the singular, this has the force of resolve (“let
me…,” “I must…”), and for the plural, exhortation (“let us…,” “we must…”),
respectively. For the third person (singular or plural), the Optative expresses the idea that
an audience which is not being directly addressed must do something; this carries an
obligative (“he/she/it must…”) force. For all three persons, the formal expression of
imperative constructions is equivalent; there is no formally discrete second person
conjugation (cf. Dimmendaal 2000:175, Watters 2000:203, who note that in most
languages the subject pronoun is omitted for second person imperatives).
More broadly, Mambay speakers use the Optative to communicate intentions other than
those which are strictly imperative. For example, third person Optative verb forms may
express a jussive (“may he/she/it”) force. Other more specific functions (for example,
suggestion or imploring) are expressed by using TAM indicators in conjunction with the
Optative forms (7.6.1).
Optative verb forms are found with all of the pronominal persons (cf. 6.1.1), and in all
cases a subject pronoun is obligatory. The Optative is structured as follows:
subject pronoun +verbOptative pronoun (CV)stem (Optative tone) (+ optional reflexive suffix)ex. mí

1SG:OPT climb:OPTlet me climb! / I must climbmá

Irrealis (i.e., Future) as well as negative Perfective and negative nonPerfective clauses, share a CVV structure; while the tone melody for the
affirmative Indicative Irrealis and negative Perfective pronouns is HL,
that of the negative non-Perfective pronouns is LH.

or negative.

"However, a couple of generalIdeophones, sometimes referred to as phonaesthemes (Dimmendaal 2000:183),
distinguish themselves from other morphemes and words primarily in the way that they
refer and mean. They transcend the arbitrary sound-symbol relationship characteristic of
most lexical items and enrich discourse by dramatizing salient real-world phenomena as
they are perceived by users of the language (Voeltz and Kilian-Hatz 2001:3): they are
“descriptive of sound, colour, smell, manner, appearance, state, action or intensity…vivid
vocal images or representations of visual, auditory and other sensory or mental
experiences” (Cole 1955:370).
In Mambay, the distinctive structure of ideophones, which often deviates from canonical
structural characteristics of the classes in which they are found (cf. Welmers 1973:462,
Elders 2001:98–100), is generated by these perceptions. As the later sections of the
chapter demonstrate, structural repetition is perhaps the most salient feature to result, and
is an important component of morphological structure as well as derivational processes.
Also, ideophones make significant use of intonation, more so than other words (4.4.1; cf.
Newman 2000:242).
At the level of discourse, ideophones are a basic means of establishing the importance of
an entity or an action. Anonby (2005:15) points out that in Mambay, the simple presence
of an ideophone highlights an element within a discourse; conversely, only important
elements are accompanied by ideophones (this is evident in all of the longer texts found
at the end of this study). This tendency is especially evident in the climax of stories,
where each verb is characteristically accompanied by an ideophone (p. 16). In addition to
its presence, the way in which an ideophone is presented is an important means of
marking emphasis. In particular, this presentation allows the speaker to regulate the
degree of emphasis. For example, the pitch intervals signalling tonal register raising and
lowering (4.4.1) are more drastic with ideophones than with other words. Further,
repetition (e.g. 8.4.2.1.2, 8.5) and lengthening of segments (e.g. 7.1.2.2, 8.5.3), which are
used as a means of echoing real-world phenomena (cf. Doke 1935:118–9, Watters
2000:196), starkly underscore the discourse elements to which the ideophones affected by
these processes relate.
In the present section, methodological issues relating to the description of ideophones are
addressed in further detail. The remainder of the chapter is then devoted to the structural
description of ideophonic adverbs (8.3), adjectives (which appear to be inherently
ideophonic; see 8.4) and a description of derivational issues pertinent to ideophones (8.5).
Ideophonic nouns and verbs are treated elsewhere (5.11 and 7.1.2.2), but the principles
presented in this section are applicable for these morphological subclasses.
Methodological issues
Rather than attempting an exhaustive analysis of ideophones in Mambay, the present
chapter provides a basic descriptive framework for an intricate but indistinctly structured385area of the language. The study of ideophones in Mambay is problematic, and several
methodological comments are in order.
First of all, ideophones are difficult to elicit (cf. Welmers 1973:461). Initially, the
researcher encounters the perception among speakers of a language that since ideophones
are poorly represented in the written languages with which they are familiar, they are
irrelevant as linguistic data. Once this idea has been countered, a deeper issue remains:
the relationship of ideophones to larger texts. A basic function of ideophones is to enrich
texts, and ideophones are inseparable from these texts (Voeltz and Kilian-Hatz 2001:3).
Whereas an inevitably small inventory of ideophones based on an French or English
wordlist might suggest that they are peripheral to the language, an examination of natural
speech, including texts such as those found at the end of this study, shows that they are
integral to both the structure and the flavour of discourse (as mentioned in 8.2 above).
Secondly, unlike other morphological classes, usage of ideophones varies considerably
from one person to another, and outside the context of discourse, speakers of the
language are often unable to determine the meaning of ideophones used by people from
other clans or villages (cf. Childs 2001:67–70). In the ideophonic lexicon, both the
words used as well as the meanings of these words are variable among speakers. And
even where people concur on the form and meaning of a given ideophone, they may
differ regarding its admissibility in the various host word classes (adverb, adjective, noun
and verb; see especially 8.5.6). Numerous speakers of Mambay have been involved in
this study of ideophones; however, in order to cope with the complexity of the
information, this chapter relies on data gathered from the researcher’s primary language
assistant.
Thirdly, it is difficult to draw a line between those words in a given class which are
ideophonic and those which are not (Welmers 1973:460). Transparent sound symbolism
and, secondarily, non-canonical structures provide a basis for deciding what is
ideophonic. In the present analysis, such words are used as structural templates for the
comparison of words whose ideophonic qualities are more difficult to establish.
The following example serves as a case in point. As stated above, ideophones dominate
the word classes of adverb and adjective (cf. 8.2, introductory discussion). However,
except in the case of directional adverbs (and to some degree, TAM adverbs), it is
difficult to identify any adverbs or adjectives which are not ideophonic. Quantifiers
(adverbial or adjectival) such as the following might be expected to distinguish
themselves formally from ideophonic qualifiers:
bî’
yâN7
gáb
lôNw
té%éa bit, slowly, almost
halfway (measured horizontally)
halfway (measured vertically)
very, much
completely, all, whole, together386However, in the language these quantifiers exhibit the non-canonical characteristics of
ideophones outlined in the discussion above (e.g., non-canonical structure, repetition and
repeatability, and highly variable intonation).
It is clear that ideophones present some fundamental challenges to morphological
classification. In the following sections, ideophones whose identity is unambiguous
(based on syntactic limitations) provide a structural framework for the consideration of a
given class. However, morphological ambivalence is an important feature of ideophones
in Mambay, and flexibility in class membership is revisited in (8.5.6) below.","[402, 403, 404]"

ex. mì héérà
1SG climb:VNI climb / I am climbingrò héérà

must accompany the noun (7.3.2.1).

thingThe verbal plural affix 4zí (7.3.1.1) is used with verbal nouns in Imperfective
conjugations. With intransitive verbs, it attaches following the first syllable of the verbal
noun. For monosyllabic verbal nouns, this is straightforward.
mì Qáà
1SG move.away:VNI move away / I am moving awaynà Qáà4zí
we (incl.) move away / we (incl.) are moving away
1&2 move.away:VN-PL
With disyllabic verbal nouns, morphophonological alternations are complex. If the
verbal noun has two light syllables and the vowel of the first syllable is an exact echo of
the second syllable’s vowel (i.e., V1=V2), the second vowel is deleted when 4zí is added.
mì vágà
1SG go:VNI go / I am goingnà vâg4zí
1&2 go:VN-PLwe (incl.) go / we (incl.) are goingOtherwise, the second syllable is maintained, and 4zí precedes it.
mì héérà
1SG climb:VNI climb / I am climbingnà héé4zí4rà
1&2 climb:VN-PL-VNwe (incl.) climb / we (incl.) are climbing (cf. héérà ‘climbing’)347The affixation of 4zí to some disyllabic nouns is accompanied by irregular morphological
alternations—even suppletion. For example, the final syllable of a two-syllable irregular
verbal noun changes to 4rV if the original suffix is 4gV. (This alternation corresponds
the domain of vestigial noun suffixes, which are otherwise opaque. Note also that
historically, the value of the final vowel has often assimilated partially to the stem; see
5.1.3.2 and Anonby 2007b:REF).

The tone of Imperfective forms of intransitive verbs is lexically determined and
unpredictable, because it is the same as that of the irregular verbal noun used in an
Imperfective function (5.9.1.2). Most commonly, it is HL (for Imperfective forms
corresponding to intransitive stems in any tone class; see 5.9.1.2). For transitive verbs,
the tone melody of the verbal noun is uniform within a given tonal class (5.9.1.1).
Examples of Imperfective forms from each of the six tonal classes (separated here for
transitivity) are as follows:349tonal class, v. word tone

Full paradigms are given for each class in Appendix 2. Negative forms of the
Imperfective, which are marked with a HL pronoun, are discussed in 7.5.
An example from the data which shows that an Imperfective may be anchored to past
events in a story line is as follows:

oneTaw took hold of them (lit. put his hand onto it), headed (lit. grabbed the path)
home, [and] sucked (lit. sucks / is sucking) them one by one.
7.4.1.2 Irrealis
Irrealis forms signal events that have not already happened and which are not happening.
They have in common a CVV subject pronoun shape. Irrealis verb forms are represented
by the Future tense and negated Indicative verb forms. Although this higher-level
grouping could seem like an ad hoc device to account for a coincidental formal match,
Payne (1997:244–5) and Palmer (2001:168–75) state that both future and negative forms
frequently pattern as irrealis in languages that mark this distinction; Roberts (1990) gives
examples of this (see especially p. 378).
While the Future tense is presented in this section, negated Indicative verb forms are
addressed in 7.5.","[363, 364, 365, 366, 367]"
"9.1.1 Syntactic distribution of numerals
Numerals often modify nouns, whether as a dependent element in a noun phrase or as a
predicate of a verbless clause (9.1.1.1). There are also cases in the data where they
appear to function adverbially (9.1.1.2). Finally, they are used for mathematical
operations even when there is no syntactic head in view (9.1.1.3).
9.1.1.1 As noun modifiers
Numerals are most commonly found as a dependent element in a noun phrase. Here, they
distinguish themselves syntactically from other noun modifiers in that they prototypically
follow the unmarked free form of a noun rather than its linked form (5.2.2). In this way,
a noun + numeral phrase resembles nouns in apposition (5.2.1) rather than a simple noun
phrase (5.14).

definite count constructions. These are composed of the linked (5.2.2) form of a head
noun followed by a numeral.",[427]
"9.3.1 Prepositional phrase structure
Prepositions head prepositional phrases, where they are located at the phrases’ left edge
(in this regard, prepositional phrases resemble noun phrases, which are also left-headed;
see 5.14). A preposition is always followed by a noun or a noun-phrase complement.

"10.1.3 Verbless clauses
Verbless clauses (chains) are common in Mambay. Except in the case of interrogative
pronouns, they must contain another element in addition to a noun or noun phrase (6.2,
43610.1.2.2). Verbless clauses are constructed by combining a subject noun phrase
(minimally consisting of a noun or pronoun) with one of the following elements:
- particle (10.1.3.1);
- noun (phrase) (0);
- adjective (10.1.3.3);
- numeral (10.1.3.4); or
- prepositional phrase (10.1.3.5).
The structure and, in some cases, function of each type of construction are considered in
the following subsections.
10.1.3.1 Noun + particle
The simplest verbless clauses are those comprised of a (pro)noun and an Indicative
particle (10.1.2).

yó

goodness indeed10.1.3.2 Noun + noun (phrase)
Equivalence-type (A is B / A is a kind of B / A is identified by B) clauses are constructed
by juxtaposing a (pro)noun with another noun or noun phrase.

zòògí kúù the guineafowl is [a kind of] wild bird
guineafowl bird:LF bushland
fíílò páhnà
house mudthe house is [made of] mudLocative clauses may be constructed in the same way, except that the second noun
necessarily refers to a place. This leads to structural ambiguity which may be resolved by
appealing to discourse-internal references as well as the text-external referential realm.
mì fíílò
1SG houseI am at the house (/I am the house)437Ká%à káàkààlá
Kada KaakaalaKada is in Kaakaala (/Kada is Kaakaala)When the predicate of a verbless clause is a noun which describes the quality of the
subject, the subject and the predicate noun are linked by the attributive copula ká.
Although this particle may have originated historically from a preposition (cf. Elders
2000:243), in Mambay it is not used synchronically in any other context.

languages (Elders 2006). In Mundang, for example, linked forms are attested for nouns
and some nominals (noun-like words including verbal nouns, adjectives, numerals and
possessive pronouns; see Elders 2000:102). However, the distribution of linked forms in
Mundang is more tightly based on occurrence in non phrase-final position.
Several of the basic numerals in Mambay exhibit linked forms in non phrase-final
position (9.1.2.1.1). This pattern is, like that of Mundang, defined by syntactic position
rather than grammatical relations.","[187, 188]"

dream of Africa and made it come true; and to Tinaga Parisa and Kyahrimi Nisse, my
hot-blooded little Mambay girls.
The present research on Mambay was conducted for a doctoral programme in the
Department of African Languages and Cultures at Leiden University in the Netherlands.
Fieldwork was funded within the context of a language development consultancy jointly
administered by SIL Chad and SIL Cameroon. Authorization for field research was
granted by MINREST (the Ministère de la Recherche Scientifique et Technique) of
Cameroon, permit 006/MINREST/B00/D00/D11.
I wish to thank my colleagues at Leiden University for their insight, humour, and
encouragement, in particular Christian Rapold, Maarten Kossmann, and K’es Mulugeta
Seyoum.
I thank my colleagues of SIL Chad and SIL Cameroon, many of whom contributed in
specific ways to the success this research and the enjoyment of our work together: Padeu
Dakouli, Diane Friesen, Marti Giger, Caroline Grant, Jeff Heath, Jérémie Mondy Mégay,
Julien Tchékoua, Bruce Jakeway, Gideon Noussi, Edward and Diane Tong, and Liz
Williams. Discussions on a wide range of linguistic topics with Jim Roberts, Lukas
Neukom and Richard Gravina were constructive. Vaughn and Mary Ohlman helped us
greatly during times of sickness.
I appreciated academic exchange with many other people working in the field.
Assessments of aspects of the present research by Roger Blench, John Esling, Ken Olson,
Cho Jun-Mo and Gordon Tisher were beneficial. In particular, Stefan Elders (deceased)
did all he could to ensure that I was well-prepared for fieldwork on Mambay by
furnishing me with numerous resources which would have been otherwise difficult to
locate, by sharing his own field notes on Mambay, by involving me in his other works-inprogress in the field of Adamawa languages. Paul Eguchi similarly laid the foundation
for the present research through his previous work on Mambay, and encouraged me to
engage in this field of study. I also thank Keith Snider for fostering in me a sense of
wonder and love of language, especially in the areas of phonology and tone, and so for
inspiring me to pursue further studies in African linguistics. His comments on the tone
chapter of the present research were invaluable.iiAu Cameroun, nous avons apprécié l’accueil que nous avons reçu dans chaque secteur.
Nous reconnaissons les administrateurs tels que le préfet de Guider, le sous-préfet de
Guider, le sous-préfet de Figuil et son adjoint. En plus, nous avons apprécié la sécurité
qu’ont pourvue la gendarmerie et le poste de police de Figuil.
D’autres personnes qui ont enrichi notre séjour à Figuil sont nos frères de la congrégation
EFL à Figuil, les pères à la mission catholique de Figuil (en particulier le père Vladislav),
le patron de Figuil Pierre Roca, et le directeur de l’École de Kolléré.
Parmi les Mambay, nous avons connu un accueil chaleureux depuis le premier moment.
En effet, le pays mambay nous est devenu un foyer. Les chefs des villages mambay nous
ont ouvert la porte au peuple : nous nous sommes présentés devant les chefs de Beepahna
(Biparé), Kaakaala (Kakala), Kaakyo’w (Katchéo), Kaaku’ (Kakou), Bisooli (Bissolé) et
Kaaguma (Kagouma), et nous avons reçu leur bénédiction. D’autres chefs nous ont
accueillis depuis leurs sièges.
Arrivés au pays mambay, c’était d’abord chez Swahy Kada Moïse que nous nous sommes
installés. Il nous à considéré comme ses enfants, et pour nos propres enfants il était
dazwa’ ‘grand-père.’ Nous le remercions pour son partage de lui-même et de sa famille.
C’était un grand privilège de pouvoir travailler avec la direction (ancienne et nouvelle)
de COLAMA (Comité de langue mambay) y compris Kam Kaagbungni et Moussa Tao,
et avec ses membres, en particulier Oussoumanou Bouba, Kwe Nathaniel, Koué Agabus,
Bégui Démas et Bouba Robert. J’ai apprécié aussi l’aide de Tao Justin et de Peevina
Salomon dans l’apprentissage de la langue.
Nos voisins à Kaakaala et à Figuil étaient pour nous un support et une grande joie : Saadu
Kami Taw, Younoussa Wouri, Kada Kaakaala, Amina Beezwa’ et sa famille, Adoum
Kami, Barnabas et Tigam Kaakaala, Parna paaru Samson, Napuga, Haman Kaakaala,
Njidda Robert, et les grands parmi les Mambay qui se rassemblèrent saa napuga chez
Kami Koué. En plus, nous étions à l’aise parmi nos frères de l’église à Kaakaala et avec
leur catéchiste.
Je remercie aussi ceux que nous connaissions hors du pays mambay. À N’Djaména, nous
avons eu le plaisir de connaître Oumarou Beïki, Abassi Moustapha, Mohamadou
Maouarmi et tous les membres du Comité des Ressortissants du Canton de Beepahna
(Biparé). À Maroua, Issa Haman et Souahibou Kassala m’ont orienté avec justesse.
C’est à Oussoumanou Bouba que je réserve un remerciement tout particulier. Il est
quelqu’un qui vit selon le proverbe, « Ku’l za’ ah paa bin, muu zyagri i am » ‘Si tu
apprends la danse du pied d’un autre, tu tromperas le tien.’ Cette individualité, ferme et
parfois rigide, lui a permis pourtant de se donner sans vacillation à la promotion de sa
langue pour l’honneur de ses parents et pour l’héritage des ses enfants et de son peuple.
Nous avons connu ensemble une collaboration enrichissante, et j’espère donc que j’ai pu,
en revanche, l’aider à réaliser ses propres aspirations. En ce qui concerne notre
cheminement divergeant, je lui affirme qu’il n’y aura pas un autre comme lui, puisqueiii« Heega hii haa saa fi naale ya » ‘Un couteau ne peut pas rentrer dans le fourreau de
son collègue.’
Finalement, je dis au peuple mambay, ri zoori ro! Nous vous saluons! Kiswa! Nous
vous remercions! Comme « Tuh bom hii marva ya » ‘Un seul bracelet ne fait aucun
bruit,’ que vous vous épanouissiez dans un esprit d’entente mutuelle. La’ fah kaa fuu
peh bee naa sigzi Kaakaala ma Lahzwa’, ró haan iro kinabom. Ná liizi ka ná

For third person singular as well as third person plural pronouns, there is a partial default
vs. impersonal contrast. Whereas default third person pronouns make explicit reference
to a discourse participant, impersonal pronouns are used when a participant is not in view
(i.e., is backgrounded or irrelevant) but the grammatical context still requires a pronoun.
The default vs. impersonal distinction is formalized only for independent pronouns
(6.1.2.1) used as subjects of verbless attributive clauses (cf. 8.4.1) and for possessive
pronouns (6.1.4).
An illustration of this distinction in verbless clauses is as follows:

A marginal generic third person category in Mambay is expressed using the third person
generic pronoun duFg ‘one, they, people.’ This pronoun differs from all other twelve
pronominal person slots in that it is not found with its own distinctive pronoun forms
(i.e., subject, object and possessive); instead, it patterns syntactically like a subject noun
or an emphatic subject pronoun (6.1.5.1), since it is found as the subject in clauses which
are already accompanied by a third person (singular or plural) pronoun. In the following
examples, the generic third person pronoun duFg is compared with the formally similar
emphatic forms of the third person singular and plural:

syntactically as an emphatic subject pronoun) are as follows:

they, people’), it is never found with Perfective verb forms, which signal events that have
taken place in conjunction with specific subjects (6.1.2.2).

does not have its own distinctive pronoun forms, it is not discussed in the sections which
deal with pronoun forms.
6.1.1.4 Co-reference
In addition to the person-related pronominal categories already catalogued in this section,
Mambay makes use of a system of co-reference with third person pronouns. This system,
which helps users of the language to keep track third person referents, has been described
in Anonby (2005:27–44). In the present section, generalities of co-reference in Mambay
are laid out.
Co-reference pronouns are used to show that a real-world referent is the same as one
which has been previously designated. In contrast to anaphoric demonstratives (9.2.2),
which are used to refer back over longer distances of text, co-reference functions within a
clause.
Although they comprise a single formal set in Mambay, co-reference pronouns are used
in two capacities: reflexive and logophoric (cf. Wiesemann 1986:438, Kutsch Lojenga
2007:143–5). Reflexive co-reference pronouns are used within a simple clause to refer
back to the subject of the clause. They are represented by reflexive object pronouns
(6.1.3.2) and possessive pronouns (6.1.4).

hàh7gí Qîh
3:PFV forget:PFV name:LF)úùrú
3SG.POSShe/she/iti forgot his/her/itsj nameFor their part, logophoric co-reference pronouns in Mambay show that a participant in an
Indicative complement clause refers to the same participant as the subject of the main
clause (cf. Watters 2000:225). Specifically, it is main-clause verbs of “speech, thoughts,
feelings, or general state of consciousness” followed by the complementizer bè (10.2.2.1)
which trigger the use of logophoric pronouns in the complement clause (Clements
1975:141, cf. Hagège 1974:290). When default (non co-reference) pronouns are used in
this context, it signals a switch in pronominal reference. A pair of examples contrasting
the use of logophoric co-reference pronouns with default pronouns is as follows:
logophoric co-reference pronoun:
Ø

Unlike third person subject pronouns found in Indicative complement clauses, which
exhibit a logophoric/default contrast, those found in Optative complement clauses are
invariable.

Because the domain of logophoric co-reference is within a single main clause (including
embedded complement clauses), referentially identical subjects in juxtaposed main
clauses are marked with a default pronoun.

6.1.1.5 Formal redundancy between categories
Of the thirteen pronominal person slots, five do not share forms with other slots: 1SG,
2SG, 3GEN, 1PL and 2PL. First-and-second person (6.1.1.5.1) and most third person263(6.1.1.5.2) pronouns, in contrast, exhibit partial formal redundancy with other pronouns
in the same group.
6.1.1.5.1 First-and-second (1&2) person pronouns
The distinction between first-and-second person singular vs. plural (6.1.1.1) is absent on
(non-emphatic) verbal subject pronouns (6.1.2). Instead, it is formalized on verbs
through the use of the plurality affix 4zí (7.3.1.1) and singular vs. plural reflexive suffixes
(7.3.1.2) with verb stems.

person pronoun forms (6.1.1.1).
6.1.1.5.2 Third person pronouns
There are two sets of third person pronouns which exhibit partial formal redundancy:
third person singular with third person plural, and third person (sg./pl.) with third person
impersonal (sg./pl.).
Similarly to what happens with first-and-second person pronouns (6.1.1.5.1), a distinction
of plurality is not marked on (non-logophoric) third person verbal subject pronouns;
rather, it is formalized through the use of the inflectional plurality affix 4zí (7.3.1.1)
and/or the third person singular and plural reflexive suffixes (7.3.1.2) on verbs.

(For a discussion of the function of these affixes in plural Future forms, see 7.3.1.2 and
7.4.1.2.1).
The distinction between default and impersonal third person pronouns is formalized only
for independent pronouns and possessive pronouns (6.1.2.1, 6.1.1.2).

3SG.COREF/IMPERS.POSS6.1.2 Subject pronouns
There are seven sets of subject pronouns:
- independent (6.1.2.1);
- Perfective (6.1.2.2);
- Imperfective (6.1.2.3);
- affirmative Indicative Irrealis (Future) (6.1.2.4);
- negative Perfective (6.1.2.6);
- negative non-Perfective (6.1.2.6); and
- Optative (6.1.2.7).
As this list shows, formal diversity among subject pronouns is largely a reflection of
mood, realis value and aspect marking (cf. Wiesemann 1986:x, Burquest 1986:73–80).
Distinctions are conveyed by means of contrastive vowel length, tone, and the patterning
of third person pronouns.
The structure of first and second person subject pronouns is regular. Pronoun forms
which pattern together for the first and second person are 1) Indicative Realis, 2)
Indicative Irrealis and 3) Optative.
1. Indicative Realis pronouns represent independent pronouns, Perfective
tenses and the Imperfective, and exhibit a common CV structure.","[276, 277, 278, 279, 280, 281, 282]"
"When used with the conjunction kóó ‘-ever, even if’ and the question particle nà
(10.1.2.1), interrogative pronouns become non-interrogative but still exhibit an ‘-ever’
type of indefiniteness (cf. Welmers 1973:435).

VERBS
7VERBSThe Mambay verb system exhibits richness in the types of available verb structures as
well as the functional distinctions represented by combinations of these structures. These
possibilities are outlined in the following paragraphs.
The first major section of this chapter (7.1) introduces verb stems. While some are
canonical and morphologically simple, others are non-canonical and, in some cases,
morphologically complex. Non-canonical verbs result from the application of verbal
extensions, derivation of verbs from other parts of speech, the ideophonic nature of some
verbs, and borrowing of verbs from other languages.
The set of verbal extensions is the most significant way in which verb stems are
composed, and is investigated in detail in 7.2. This set is reminiscent of systems found
elsewhere in Niger-Congo. While some extensions found in Mambay are synchronically
productive, others are not; also, the semantic transparency of verbal extensions varies.
The subsequent section (7.3) examines verb word morphology. Segmental affixes are
dealt with in detail, and the behaviour of tone in verb words is examined. In addition,
verbs are classified with respect to transitivity and tone melody. Irregular verbs are also
considered.
Verbal inflection is explored in 7.4. Specifically, this section treats basic inflectional
categories, which are marked length on subject pronouns and tone on subject pronouns
and verb words. It is shown that a division between Indicative and Optative mood is
fundamental to the verb system, and Indicative verb forms are also distinguished for
realis value and aspect. Negative verb forms, which pattern differently than their
affirmative counterparts, are treated separately in 7.5.
The expansion of verbal inflection by means of TAM indicators, possessive constructions
and complex inflectional constructions (specifically, serial and auxiliary verbs) forms the
substance of the discussion in 7.6. A final section (7.7) discusses composite verbal
expressions and their contribution to the verb lexicon.
Unless it has been otherwise specified, example verbs are given in their basic Perfective
forms (cf. 7.4.1.1.1.1).","[314, 315, 316]"
"1.3.1 Scope and overview of this study
This study is a description of Mambay as it is spoken today. The variety under
investigation is that of the principal collaborator, Oussoumanou Bouba (see 1.3.2) of
Kaakyo’w (Katchéo), Cameroon. This variety falls within the dialect spoken by Mambay
living south of the Mayo Kebbi (1.2.3.3).
Description revolves around the phonological and morphological structure of the
language. Pertinent issues in phonetics are treated within the framework of the
phonological system, and topics in syntax, discourse structure and semantics are treated
in reference to morphological classes. A number of linguistic theories and sub-theories
have been taken into account in the present study. These are, in particular, the
structuralist tradition, functional grammar, the generative movement and its progeny
25Autosegmental Phonology, Lexical Phonology and Optimality Theory.
When
1
appropriate, theoretical insights have been incorporated ; however, the descriptive focus
of the study assumes a minimal amount of theoretical background on the part of the
reader.
In this first chapter, the Mambay ethnic group is situated geographically as well as
historically. Existing studies on the Mambay language are catalogued, and the
classification of the language and its sociolinguistic situation are considered in detail.
The final section of this chapter presents the framework and methodology of the study.
The phonology of Mambay is addressed in chapters 2–4. In chapter 2, an overview of
the phonology is presented. Contrastive phonological constituents are examined starting
with consonants and vowels, and syllable and word structure are treated in turn. A
number of interpretive issues are probed; of these, the interpretation of pharyngeal and
glottal articulations is the most involved.
Chapter 3 examines the role of nasality in the language. Nasality is shown to be
contrastive for vowels as well as consonants, and the determination of its source is often
problematic. The distribution and spread of nasality is therefore treated in reference to
domains of association, within morphemes as well as across morpheme boundaries.
Chapter 4 is devoted to an analysis of the tone system. The Mambay tone system is
depicted as a register tone system with two contrastive levels, High and Low. These
levels are organized into seven contrastive tone melodies which may be associated with
morphemes. Tonal processes, both lexical and postlexical, are also addressed. In
addition, the role of intonational phenomena, which interact with tonal phenomena, is
accounted for.
The word classes in the language are dealt with in chapters 5–9. First of all, nouns are
described in chapter 5. Of the various classes, nouns show the greatest diversity in
attested root structures. Affixational and template morphology is also a significant
attribute of nouns: this is evident in the widespread occurrence of prefixation, some
instances of which have been lexicalized, and some of which continue to function
grammatically. Template morphology, for its part, plays an active role in pluralization
and in a pervasive free vs. linked distinction on nouns. The left-headed possessive
construction, which is the primary context in which linked forms of nouns are found, is
then described in reference to three axes: spontaneous vs. lexicalized, obligatory vs.
optional possession, and alienable vs. inalienable possession. Additionally, specific types
of nouns and noun-related constructions are considered: participant noun constructions,
ideophonic nouns, proper names, compounding and other types of derivation and the
1The contribution of Autosegmental Phonology (Leben 1973, Goldsmith 1990) is especially evident in the
description of the internal structure of consonants (2.1.5), syllable structure and syllable weight (2.4.2,
2.4.3), nasality (Chapter 3) and tone (Chapter 4); that of Lexical Phonology (Kiparsky 1982, Kenstowicz
1994) is evident in the lexical/postlexical distinction that has informed the description of tone association
and tonal processes (4.1–4.3); and the insights of Optimality Theory (Archangeli and Langendoen 1997)
have been incorporated in the discussion of constraints on the distribution of nasality (3.1.1, 3.4.1, 3.4.2)
and the distribution of vowels in adjectives (8.4.2.1.1).","[42, 43]"
"In numerous cases, however, the semantic relationship between a derived noun and its
apparent source is unclear.

borrowed nouns are reinterpreted as having noun prefixes. There appear to be two
reasons for this. First, the interpretation of existing word-initial syllables helps borrowed
nouns to conform to common root shapes (cf. 5.1.1.1).

5.1.2.3.3 Derivation of nouns from other parts of speech
The prefix )ì4 (5.1.2.4.12) is productively used to derive modifiers from a number of
word classes by promoting them to the status of independent noun (5.10).

In the present section, each of the noun prefixes is presented in alphabetical order along
with comments on productivity, frequency in the lexicon, historical origins, and semantic
value, as well as examples.
5.1.2.4.1 dàThe prefix dà4 is lexically determined, and is attested with two nouns in the data:
dà4vá7
dà4zwâ’minnow sp.
grandfather(cf. zwâ’ ‘ancestry’)Considering the meaning of zwâ’ in dà4zwâ’, it is possible to posit the origin of dà4 in
dàá ‘papa’ (compare also Mundang d ì / d ‘man, person’; see Elders 2000:125, 138–
40).
That the word dà4vá7 ‘minnow sp.’ is a prefixed CVC root rather than a CVCVC noun
is confirmed by the fact that high tone of the root does not flatten to L in the context of
the possessive construction, as is the case with LH nouns (cf. 5.2.2.1):
dà4vá7dà4vá7 )ííminnow sp. / my minnow sp.cf. tùlgúmtùlgùm )íífish sp. / my fish sp.5.1.2.4.2 fàThe prefix fà4 is lexically determined, and is attested with four nouns in the data:
fà4gbàh7
fà4Nmàhná
fà4pààrá
fà4syâhoutside (n.)
footprint
ground readied for cultivation
handprint
160(cf. Nmàhná ‘foot’)
(cf. pààrá ‘field, farm’)
(cf. syâh ‘hand’)It is likely that fà4 originates in the noun fààlá (linked form: fàà; cf. 5.2.2.2.6.1) ‘back,
skin, place,’ and this semantic value is appropriate given the nouns in the data. It should
also be noted, however, that Mundang has a prefix fà derived from fàn""` ‘thing’ (Elders
2000:125, 136–7).
For three of the four terms above, whose root is also independently attested, there is a
structural as well as semantic difference between nouns with fà4 as an obligatory prefix
and those with fàà as a possessed noun.
fà4Nmàhná footprint
(cf. fàà Nmàhná ‘top of the foot, area behind the foot, place of the foot’)
fà4pààrá
ground readied for cultivation
(cf. fàà pààrá ‘back of the field, area behind the field, place of the field’)
fà4syâh
handprint
(cf. fàà syâh ‘back of the hand, area behind the hand, place of the foot’)
In dialects north of the Mayo Kebbi, the prefix fà4 is synchronically productive rather
than lexically determined, and consistently carries the meaning of fààlá / fàà ‘back, skin,
place.’ Because of this, there is no distinction in these varieties between the noun pairs
directly above.
5.1.2.4.3 fíThe prefix fí4 is synchronically productive and exhibits the same range of meaning as its
historical source fíílò: ‘house, room, chamber, concession, dwelling, context.’ Since
there is no commonly used alternative linked form for fíílò (see 5.2.2.2.6), the prefixnoun constructions in which it is found function semantically like compounds and/or
possessive constructions. Prefix-noun constructions in which it is attested in the lexicon
include the following words:
fí4gòòrá
fí4kòòlá
fí4nìì4mírà
fí4súúbà
fí4sú7gà

also lexically determined; the reason for the appearance of two forms is unknown. It is
attested with twelve nouns in the data:161kà4 á’rè

(cf. kààlá ‘axe’)There does not seem to be any consistent semantic difference between nouns of each
tonal form. It is possible that ka4 originates in the common Mambay word káálà ‘head.’
Mundang also has a tonally ambivalent prefix ka and Tupuri has kV4 ; for both of these,
the historical origin is undetermined (Elders 2000:125, 146; Ruelland 1992:145).
5.1.2.4.5 kìThe prefix kì4 is synchronically productive and exhibits the same range of meaning as
kyaF’ ‘place, time, state, atmosphere, condition,’ from which it is historically derived. As
is the case for fí4, the prefix-noun constructions in which it found function semantically
like compounds and/or possessive constructions. Prefix-noun constructions in which it is
attested in the lexicon include the following words:
kì4gòh7rò7

(cf. zàà ‘cross,’ byàá ‘water’)kì4 is also used productively in verbal noun constructions involving place or intent (cf.
7.6.3).

5.1.2.4.6 maThe prefix ma4 is lexically determined and is attested with four nouns in the data:162má4nâ’
má4ràrírà
má4swàrì
mà4zwâ’man’s mother-in-law
oily substance
sorghum (Chad dialect)
grandmother(cf. Fulf. muskuwaari)
(cf. zwâ’ ‘ancestry’)The occurrence of ma4 in mà4zwâ’ ‘grandmother’ is parallel to is appearance in dà4
zwâ’ ‘grandfather’ (cf. 5.1.2.4.1). It may be historically derived from màánì ‘mother
(al.)’. That the H-toned form is indeed a prefix is underlined by the tone melody of má4
swàrì ‘sorghum,’ which does not exhibit a standard tonal association of HL starting on
the right edge of the word (cf. 4.1.2.2). Its appearance with H tone in Mambay could be
the result of borrowing or pressure from Mundang, which has a má$ noun prefix
originating in má$nì% ‘mother’ (Elders 2000:125, 132–6).
5.1.2.4.7 naThe prefix na4 is lexically determined, and it has two tonal forms (ná4/nà4) which are
also lexically determined; the reason for the appearance of two forms is unknown. Of the
obligatorily attached prefixes, na4 is the most common: there are 25 occurrences of ná4
and 146 occurrences of nà4 as obligatory components of non-compound noun roots.
Examples of words exhibiting both tonal forms are as follows:
nà4gbògò7gà waterlily bulb
nà4lèhgá
bat
nà4sâh
request
nà4sè7rá
toothache
nà4vàhlá
minnow
ná4gáhgù
ná4gbóglà
ná4kpìrvílè
ná4rìmnú
ná4tárgìcrow
toad, frog
dust devil
tongue, bud
seasonal riverThe largest group of nouns with which na4 is found are species names and other natural
phenomena, and there are also quite a few verbal nouns (see 5.9.2.1). The high
proportion of species names accords well with the positing of the historical origin of na4
in nàmá (linked form: nàm; cf. 5.2.2.2.3) ‘animal, meat.’ In Mundang a parallel prefix
nà is found, but no source noun has been identified for it (Elders 2000:125, 146).
5.1.2.4.8 páThe prefix pá4 is lexically determined and is attested with four nouns in the data:
pá4dálà
pá4dâg4vâh
pá4tá4kpáhbrùoribi (antelope sp.)
fish sp.
(cf. dágà ‘mouth,’ vâh ‘arrow’)

163pá4wâ%4nìì4gyàh whydah (bird sp.)(cf. wâ%4nììnú ‘buttocks,’ gyàh ‘longtailed’)It appears to be historically derived from páà ‘man, father,’ and resembles the Mundang
prefix pá which originates in pánì ‘father’ (Elders 2000:125, 127–31).
5.1.2.4.9 siThe prefix si4 is lexically determined and is attested with six nouns in the data:
dâg4sì4sí’
ná4sí4swaFh
sí4gâ’
sí4kètí
sí4nùú
sí4síìspots on skin

waxbill (bird sp.)(cf. dágà ‘mouth, edge’)
(cf. gâ’ ‘fulfillment of needs’)
(cf. kètí ‘sky, life’)
(cf. nùú ‘that (dem.)’)While five of the six occurrences of si4 are H-toned, one is L-toned. The reason for the
appearance of two tonal forms is unknown. The origin of si4 is, according to a popular
etymology cited by the principal informant, the noun síì ‘valley, river.’ A similar
Mundang suffix s ' has been attributed to the Mundang word síì ‘year’ (Elders 2000:125,
141), for which the cognate in Mambay is sììrá ‘year.’
5.1.2.4.10 taThe prefix ta4 is lexically determined and is attested with four nouns in the data:
pá4tá4kpáhbrù
tà4tàhrgú
tà4dúgrì
tà4vbêrcuckoo
rock pile
weakness (Chad dialect)
(village name)(= tì4dúgrì ‘weakness’)While three of the four occurrences of ta4 are H-toned, one is L-toned. The reason for
the appearance of two tonal forms is unknown. No convincing historical source noun has
been identified for ta4, but in Mundang the similar prefix tà (for which, similarly, no
source noun has been identified) is found (Elders 2000:125, 146).
5.1.2.4.11 tiThe prefix ti4 is represented by a synchronically productive augmentative/female form tí4
as well as the ambivalent form tí4/tì4, whose tonal value and distribution is lexically
determined.
The productive form tí4 carries augmentative and/or female connotations, which suggests
that ti4 (or at least the form tí4) may be historically derived from túù ‘mother’ and/or
tíìrá ‘matron’ (also compare Mundang t and Tupuri tV-; see Elders 2000:125, 141–4164and Ruelland 1992:146). Examples of this prefix, which is discussed in further detail in
5.7.2 and 5.8.2, are as follows:
tí4byàá
tí4kpèègálarge water-body
large tree(cf. byàá ‘water’)
(cf. kpèègá ‘tree’)tí4dìgì
tí4bùù sé%gàfemale neighbour
female potter(cf. dìgì ‘neighbourship’)
(cf. búú ‘build,’ sé%gà clay cooking pot’)A productive prefix tì4 is used as a collective marker for human nouns (see 5.6.1).
Examples in which this prefix appears are:
tì4màmbày
tì4ná4syàáthe Mambay people (cf. màmbày ‘(ethnic name)’)
white people
(cf. ná4syàá ‘fire, gun‘)There is not, however, any semantic evidence for a relation between the collective prefix
tì4 and the obligatory noun prefix of the same shape.
As is the case with ka4 and na4, when ti4 is an obligatory component of specific lexical
items, it has two tonal forms (tí4/tì4) which are lexically determined; the reason for the
appearance of two forms is unknown. There does not seem to be any consistent semantic
difference between nouns of each tonal form. The largest group of nouns with which ti4
is found are species names, and there are also a number of reduplicated nouns (5.11.2).
While an augmentative and/or female semantic value is not incompatible with the nouns
of which it is a part, neither is it transparent.
ti4 is well-represented in the lexicon: there are 65 occurrences of tí4 and 13 occurrences
of tì4 as an obligatory component of non-compound noun roots. Examples of words
exhibiting both tonal forms of the prefix ti4 are as follows:

10.2.2.3 Relative clauses
Relative clauses, which function as noun modifiers, are uniformly postnominal: they
follow the linked form (5.2.2) of the noun they modify and the invariable relativizer nàá
(cf. 5.14.6).

Relative clauses in Mambay are versatile: there appear to be few restrictions on the
distribution of TAM in relative clauses, and the antecedent nouns they accompany may
function as their subjects, objects or locative/temporal complements.
First of all, subject relative clauses—those for which the antecedent noun is the subject of
the relative clause—are common (relative clauses are shown in square brackets).

"2886.1.5.1 Emphatic subject pronouns
For most of the personal pronouns, any type of emphatic subject pronoun may be
produced by placing an independent pronoun (6.1.2.1) before a subject pronoun of the
same person.

(6.1.5.1.2) and third person plural (6.1.5.1.3), the emphatic pronoun template is more
complex than this. In all of these cases, the attested strategies include lengthening of
independent pronouns and the presence of a word-final L tone (compare emphatic
negative objects in 10.1.2.3). This is possible for these three pronouns only because they
are segmentally distinct from verbal subject pronouns, where length and tone are already
used to mark TAM distinctions (6.1.2.4–6.1.2.6).
6.1.5.1.1 Third person singular
For emphatic forms of third person singular subject pronouns, the pronoun dúù is used.
It resembles the default third person singular independent pronoun dú (6.1.2.1), but its
vowel is long and it carries a HL rather than a H tone melody.
For most verb forms, dúù patterns like other emphatic subject pronouns (6.1.5.1): it is
placed before a regular subject pronoun.

"7.3.3 Irregular verbs
There are three verbs with irregular conjugations in Mambay: vè ‘go’ (7.3.3.1), húm
‘come’ (7.3.3.2) and tògó ‘be’ (7.3.3.3).
7.3.3.1 vè ‘go’
The verb vè ‘go’ is morphologically irregular (7.3.3.1.1) and exhibits a Realis Future
category not found with other verbs (7.3.3.1.2).
7.3.3.1.1 Morphological irregularities
In its basic Perfective form, vè is conjugated like other verbs: the stem is segmentally
invariable (see Appendix 2). However, elsewhere vè has an irregular conjugation in
which, among other things, the stem vowel typically assimilates to the quality of the
vowel in the accompanying reflexive suffixes. This is illustrated by the following Future

short 2SG conjugation, even though there is no vowel in the reflexive suffix.

7.3.3.1.2 Realis Future
The verb vè ‘go’ is unique in that it exhibits an additional Realis Future conjugation.
Like Realis verb forms, it is found with a CV pronoun; this pronoun patterns in the same
way as the Imperfective pronoun (7.4.1.1). However, the tone on the verb stem is that of
the Future (which is normally Irrealis; cf. 7.4.1.2.1). Semantically, the Realis Future of
vè is more certain and more immediate than the Irrealis Future.

expansions of verbal inflection with similar meanings use the verb vè ‘go’; in one case, it
is in the context of a serial verb construction (7.6.3.1), and in the other case it is as an
auxiliary (7.6.3.2.1).
7.3.3.2 húm ‘come’
The verb húm ‘come’ is irregular in that it allows a contracted root form when it is
accompanied by the directional adverb suffix 4ìn ~ 4n` (from hîn) ‘to here’ (7.3.1.6,
8.1.1.1) in certain conjugations.
Segmentally, the root form of ‘come’ is normally húm. However, when 4ìn ~ 4n` ‘to
here’ accompanies the verb and there is no reflexive suffix (7.3.1.2), the hú of the first
syllable may be dropped. In addition, the quality of the stem vowel ú, which in the
normal conjugation is echoed before 4ìn ~ 4n` (ex. húmûn), is retained in the contracted
forms. This is evident in future forms of húm with 4ìn ~ 4n`:personpn.normal

follows that of the normal conjugation (múnzîn).
The normal paradigm for húm is accounted for by the tonal Class 1 paradigm in
Appendix 2. Contracted forms of húm with 4ìn ~ 4n` in other conjugations are tonally
regular and segmentally identical to the future forms given above.
7.3.3.3 tògó ‘be’

"10.1.1 Constituent order
In Anonby (2005:8–13), constituent order in Mambay is detailed, and the effects of
changes in order are also examined. In the present study, a basic summary is provided.
In Mambay, the basic (unmarked) order of major constituents in verbal clauses is rigidly
SVO (subject–verb–object).

recipient. Two strategies are available in such situations, and in both cases, the more
salient object in the discourse follows the other object. If the more salient object is a
patient, it simply follows the recipient:
Ø

1SG.OBJ axehe/she/it gave me an axeIf the more salient object is a recipient, it is introduced after the patient with the

to 1SG.OBJIn both cases, object pronouns (6.1.3.1) are used for a pronominal recipient.
Subsequent to the SVO complex, the following order is exhibited: directional adverb –
locative (spatial or temporal) adverbial complement – aspectual or descriptive adverbial
complement – particle. Examples which illustrate this ordering are as follows:

A small number of particles are used in reference to clauses and clause constituents.
(Particles which are used to define relations between clauses are discussed separately in
10.2.2).
Unlike adverbs, which are minimally comprised of a heavy syllable, clause- and clause
constituent-modifying particles uniformly exhibit a light (CV) syllable.
These particles fall into three groups: Indicative particles, Optative particles, and an
attributive copula ká. While Indicative particles are treated in the present section,
Optative particles are described in the chapter on verbs (7.6.1.1.2), and the attributive
copula is described in the context of verbless clauses (10.1.3.2).
Four Indicative particles are found in Mambay:
nà
yó
yá
rè(question particle; see also 4.4.2.3)
(affirmative particle)
(negative particle)
(topicalization particle)Indicative particles are used in reference to clauses as well as clause constituents. Since
the core of a clause is prototypically a verb, applying a particle to a verbal clause is
formally and functionally equivalent to applying it to the verb (see 7.6.1.1 for examples).
In the following section, each of the Indicative particles is shown (whenever attested) in a
verbless clause, with an Indicative verb, and with at least one other clause constituent.

When the question particle nà is juxtaposed with a noun, an interrogative clause results.

PHONOLOGICAL STRUCTURE
2PHONOLOGICAL STRUCTUREThe Mambay language is characterized by a rich system of phonological structures. In
this chapter, consonants and vowels are treated first (2.1 and 2.2). While some of the
phonetic phenomena that have been explored in Anonby (2006) are reviewed here,
analyses of phonological structures, in particular issues relating to both consonants and
vowels (2.3), are pursued in greater detail. These sections are followed by descriptions of
syllable structure (2.4) and word structure (2.5). Additional chapters have been devoted
to nasality (Chapter 4) and tone (Chapter 5); each of these phenomena represents an
involved system which functions in reference to the structures described in the present
chapter.
The section on consonants presents an inventory of twenty-nine contrastive consonants in
Mambay, with four additional consonants found in borrowed words (2.1.1). The six
attested places of articulation (labial, alveolar, palatal, velar, labial-velar and glottal)
reflect a system typical of the Niger-Congo phylum in general (Williamson and Blench
2000:37) and the Kebi-Benue languages in particular (Boyd 1974:21, Elders 2006).
However, the palatal series in particular is less developed than that which has been
described in closely related languages (ibid.); contrastive palatal stops, prenasalized
stops, fricatives and nasals are all absent in Mambay.
Nine distinct manners of consonant articulation are represented (see the chart in 2.1.1
below). These are, for the most part, the same as those of closely related languages.
However, the prenasalized stops found in other Kebi-Benue languages (Boyd 1974:21–
2)—albeit on a reduced scale in the Northern group (Elders 2006)—are lacking in words
of Mambay origin. Two other conspicuous components of the consonant inventory are a
profoundly phonologized labial flap (2.1.8) and a robust glottalic series consisting of
eight members, five of which are oral and three of which are nasal. Along with other
glottalic segments, the two implosives in the language pattern as sonorants rather than
obstruents, since they are sensitive to nasality (2.1.1 below and 3.2; see also Kaye 1981,
Creissels 1994:107 and Clements 2000:132).
The distribution of consonants, which is discussed in various syllable and morpheme
positions (2.1.2), is followed by an establishment of contrast among members of the
inventory (2.1.3). Further sections devoted to consonants regard interpretive issues
(2.1.4), internal structure of consonants (2.1.5), phonetic realizations (2.1.6), airstream
mechanisms (2.1.7) and the labial flap (2.1.8).","[48, 49, 50]"

In addition to being followed by verbal nouns (7.6.3.2.1), auxiliaries may be followed by
subordinate clauses. Past and Future 2 constructions are made possible by periphrastic373constructions in which the auxiliary verb %áá ‘find, succeed, have’ is followed by a
subordinate clause (cf. 10.2.2.2).

Composite verbal expressions constitute an important part of the verb lexicon; well over
a third of the verbs in the data (347 out of 948) are composite expressions. In contrast to
verb expansions, which have to do with enrichment of the inflectional system (7.6),
composite verbal expressions may be found as lexical items (Dimmendaal 2000:179). As
with compound nouns (cf. 5.4), composite verbal expressions are primarily distinguished
from spontaneously constructed verb phrases by recurrent usage rather than structure. As
fixed collocations, they tend to express a single verbal concept; and this semantic value is
often idiomatic.
The following structures have been attested for composite verbal expressions:
- verb stem + noun (7.7.1)
- verb stem + prepositional phrase (7.7.2)
- verb stem + directional adverb (7.7.3)
- verb stem + adjective (7.7.4)
- verb stem + ideophonic adverb (7.7.5)
For composite verbal expressions containing transitive verbs and whose additional
element is not a noun, an object or dummy object (7.3.2.1.2) (neither of which are
necessarily lexicalized as part of the composite verbal expression) must also be present.

ADVERBS, ADJECTIVES AND IDEOPHONES
8ADVERBS, ADJECTIVES AND IDEOPHONESThis chapter deals with adverbs and adjectives. Since ideophones comprise a majority of
adverbs as well as adjectives, they are also treated here as a parallel topic with major
implications for both of these word classes. The first major section (8.1) discusses
adverbs, with a focus on two categories: directional adverbs and TAM
(tense/aspect/mode) adverbs. The subsequent section addresses topics pertaining to
ideophones in general (8.2). The description then focusses on ideophonic adverbs (8.3)
as well as adjectives (8.4), the great majority of which are ideophonic. The final section
treats derivational phenomena associated with ideophones from various word classes
(8.5).","[390, 391, 392, 393, 394, 395, 396]"
"7.1.2 Non-canonical verb stems
Non-canonical verb stems, which exhibit formal differences from those which are
canonical, are of several types. While some non-canonical verb stems are derived from
verb roots in the language by means of verbal extensions (7.2), others are derived from
various parts of speech (7.1.2.1). In many cases, verbal derivation is historically
significant rather than synchronically productive. Along with derived stems, ideophonic
verbs (7.1.2.2) and verbs borrowed from other languages (7.1.2.3) pattern as noncanonical verb stems.
Non-canonical stems are uniformly transitive. In contrast to canonical stems (7.1.1), they
allow a wide range of consonants in the coda of the stem-initial syllable. Non-canonical
stems are also distinguished in that they are limited to tonal Classes 5 and 6, which they
represent exclusively. Like morphologically simple stems, non-canonical stems in tonal300Class 5 are monosyllabic; however, non-canonical stems in tonal Class 6 range from one
(superheavy; see 2.4.3) to four syllables. Vowels in the non-initial syllables of the stem
are either echo vowels (in CV.CVC stems) or the default vowel i (in all other cases).
In total, there are 294 non-canonical verb stems of Mambay origin in the data. Attested
CV shapes of these stems, along with the number of occurrences and illustrative
examples, are as follows:

In addition to arising from derivation by means of verbal extensions (7.2), it appears that
a few verb stems are derived from nouns and adjectives; while there is no verb root
corresponding to certain verb stems, these other parts of speech from which they are
presumably derived are attested. For monosyllabic roots, the derivational template adds
gi to the end of it, and assigns the word to tonal Class 6 (cf. 7.3.2.2).

A small group of ideophonic verb stems is found in Mambay. The ideophonic nature of
these verbs is, like that of ideophones in other word classes, pervasive but difficult to
demonstrate for all examples; and as for Mambay ideophones in general, it is put forward
in light of the recurrent convergence of non-canonical structures and sound symbolism
(1.3.1, 8.2).
Ideophonic verb stems exhibit basic structures limited to non-canonical verbs: a CVX.CV
stem shape, and Class 5 or 6 tone melody (7.1.2, 7.3.2.2.1). And like other non-canonical
verbs, they are uniformly transitive (7.1.2, 7.3.2.1.2).
Ideophonic verb stems exhibit, in addition, consonant distribution patterns that are not
found with other types of verb stems. In the following examples, four geminate
obstruents are attested. In addition, the consonants t, b and vb, which are never found in
the second syllable of any other type of verb stem, are attested among ideophonic verbs
in the data. Finally, the nasalized vowel o, which is found in only two morphologically
simple items in the data (3.1.2), appears in this list of ideophonic verbs:

A handful of verb stems borrowed from Fulfulde are used in Mambay. Usage is much
more frequent among Mambay speakers in ethnically mixed communities (cf. 1.2.3.1).
The tone melody associated with these verbs is the same as that of other derived verbs,
namely Class 6 (7.3.2.2). While four of the five examples below conform to CV patterns
found with other non-canonical verb stems of Mambay origin (cf. beginning of 7.1.2), the
CV pattern of màrí ‘possess’ is unique (Fulfulde source vocabulary for these examples is
from Noye 1974).

Verbal extensions are the primary way by which verb stems in Mambay become derived
(cf. 7.1.2). Several verbal extensions may be easily recognized by virtue of their
productivity and because their semantic and morphological contribution is readily
identifiable; however, others are less productive and are better considered vestiges of a
historical system of verbal extension within Niger-Congo. These historical origins will
not be addressed here, but the methodology and findings of Elders (2000:172–94)
concerning Mundang are relevant to a discussion of this topic in Mambay.
In addition to their role in the Mambay verb system, verbal extensions appear to be
related to vestigial suffixes found on nouns (5.1.3.2). This topic has been addressed in
Anonby 2007b:REF.
In the sections that follow, an inventory of verbal extensions is provided (7.2.1). After a
discussion of the distribution of verbal extensions (7.2.2), both synchronically productive
303and unproductive extensions (7.2.3 and 7.2.4) are described. Attested combinations of
verbal extensions are catalogued (7.2.5), and a problem concerning the semantic and
phonological relationship among several of the suffixes is examined (7.2.6).","[317, 318, 319, 320, 321]"

Relative clauses (10.2.2.3), like the modifiers described above, may also be promoted to
the status of independent noun with )ì4. However, in contrast to the other modifiers, the
antecedent concept to which they refer must be expressed.
Example noun phrases comprised of a head noun and a dependent relative clause are as
follows:

a thing that happened
îg nàá nú4lé káá4mi

child HEAD-REL sleep:PERF-3SG.REFL head:2SG.POSS.INAL
the child that has gone to sleep before you do5.11 Ideophonic nouns
Unlike the categories of adjective and adverb, in which ideophones are dominant,
ideophones are marginally represented among nouns.
There are no syntactic indicators which separate ideophonic nouns from other nouns, nor
are there any precise morphological criteria whereby they can be distinguished.
However, there is a strong correlation between non-canonical noun structure (5.1.1.1) and
ideophonic function (as described in 8.2). For example, species names and unusual items
whose phonological forms reflect perceptual realities are well-represented (and perhaps
even normative) among non-canonical nouns (examples are given in 5.11.1). In
particular, this is the case for noun stems which exhibit reduplication (5.11.2). In
addition to nouns which are inherently ideophonic, ideophonic nouns derived from
adjectives also exist (5.11.3).","[258, 259, 260, 261]"
"7.4.2.2 Subjunctive constructions with kà
Optative verb forms are also found in subjunctive constructions with the adverbializer kà
‘when, and then’ (10.2.2.2). Semantically, a purpose clause (‘so that, in order to’) results
from the combination of kà and the Optative verb form. The structure of the Optative in
this context is the same as that found in main clauses (7.4.2.1).
Examples of Optative verb forms used with kà are as follows:

7.4.2.3 Subjunctive constructions with pá ‘make, do’
Finally, Optative verb forms are found in subjunctive constructions which pattern as the
object of pá ‘make, do’ (7.6.3). In this case, a periphrastic causitive construction results:356mì pàg4rú

)ígà
eat:OPT thingI made him/her/it eat something7.5 Verbal negation
Five of the six basic inflectional categories (7.4) have corresponding negative forms
(7.5.1). The segmental and tonal form of a verb word remains constant when it is
negated. Verbal negation is instead marked by negative particles (7.5.2), and with
Indicative verb forms, by negative subject pronouns (7.5.3). A summary of negative
verbal forms is provided in 7.5.4.","[373, 374]"
"Three of the underived numerals ( àtì ‘two,’ tàrnágà ‘seven’ and fwàrnágà ‘eight’)
exhibit contracted forms reminiscent of nouns subjected to a linked noun template
(5.2.2). However, in contrast to the linked noun template, contraction of these numerals
has no grammatical significance. Rather, it is a predictable phenomenon which applies in
non phrase-final position. In each case, the final vowel is dropped and the tone melody
remains stable. Example alternations are as follows:

Of the numerals from one to ten, the short form of ‘nine’ and the long forms of ‘eight,’
‘nine’ and ‘ten’ have been derived. Of these, three of the numbers are derived from
clauses, and one from a noun phrase (in another dialect, it is derived from a prepositional
phrase).
The meanings of component morphemes are semantically transparent, referring to hand
motions used in counting. Dialect differences in the short forms of ‘nine’ stem from use
of contrasting senses of the word syâh (linked form: sêh; see 5.2.2.2.2): ‘hand’ / ‘finger.’
These derived numerals are as follows:
eight (long form), derived from a clause:

9.1.2.4 Higher numeral values
Words indicating the higher numeral values ‘hundred,’ ‘thousand,’ and ‘million’ have
been borrowed from other languages. These numerals are as follows:
tèèméérè
)ùzìnéérè
gàmbù
mìlyô7hundred (cf. Fulf. teemerre ~ te’merre )
thousand (cf. Fulf. ujineere)
thousand (calque from Fulf.; see below)
million (cf. Fr. million))ùzìnéérè is the more common term for the numeral ‘thousand.’ gàmbù, which is used
primarily but not exclusively for counting money, means both ‘bag’ and ‘thousand.’
While gàmbù does not constitute a lexical borrowing, it is likely a calque from Fulfulde,
which has extended the term booro ‘bag’ to denote ‘one thousand francs’ (Eguchi
1971:164–5, cf. Elders 2000:151).
As is the case with káálà ‘head, ten,’ these higher values act as numerals rather than
nouns in count constructions (Welmers 1973:289). This is demonstrated by the nonapplication of linked noun morphology (cf. 5.2.2) which would be present on the head
noun if the numerals were nouns.

In Mambay, fractions are used to express approximate numeric proportions, and
comparison of whole numerals expresses exact proportions.
The following fractions expressing approximate proportions of nouns have been attested:
dágà

preposition má ‘with, and.’

‘half’ more exactly. Eguchi (1971:165) also gives the term réétì réétà (lit’ ‘half of
half’) for the concept of ‘one quarter’; however, this term has not been accepted by
Mambay speakers in the context of the present research.
Two adverbs are also used to express fractional proportion:

Ordinal nouns are, prototypically, nominalized numerals (9.1.2) which express the place
of a noun within a series. In Mambay, most ordinal nouns are formed by adding the
ordinal suffix 4rì to a numeral. Ordinal nouns range from ‘first’ to ‘tenth’ and also
include the word ‘last.’ They are given here, alongside the numerals to which they
correspond (when relevant):

dialect difference (1.2.3.3).
Except for dâg tômná ‘first’ (9.1.3.1), ordinal nouns are found in head (initial) position
in the noun phrases in which they are found (cf. 5.2, 5.14).","[430, 431, 432, 433, 434, 435, 436]"
"5.3.1 Semantic relations
In Mambay as well as other languages, the semantic relations signalled by possessive
(i.e., “genitival” or “associative”) constructions are much more varied than possession.
In possessive constructions, possession is prototypical but semantic relations are varied
and flexible; those commonly signalled by the dependent noun in reference to the head
noun include the following (these examples are alienable possessive constructions; see
5.3.3.3):
possession:hûg vwáà
bone:LF dogsocial relation: túù ígà
mother:LF childbone of dog

Possessive constructions are minimally composed of a possessed head noun followed by
a dependent possessor noun. As is typically the case for head nouns followed by a
dependent element, the head noun exhibits the linked noun form; the dependent noun
exhibits the unmarked free form (5.2.1, 5.14). This is evident in the following N + N183possessive constructions composed of the nouns ‘hole’ (free form: nwâ’; linked form:
nû’) and ‘mud wasp’ (free form: hámzà; linked form: hámzì) (alternations between free
forms and linked forms of nouns are addressed in 5.2.2 above):
nû’ hámzà
hole:LF mud.wasphole of mud wasphámzì nwâ’
mud.wasp:LF holemud wasp of holeWhen the dependent possessor noun is the possessed head of another element, it exhibits the
linked form of the noun. This is evident in the following N + [N + N] constructions:
nû’ [hámzì só’lé]
hole of large mud wasp
hole:LF mud.wasp:LF greatness
hámzì [nû’ só’lé]
mud wasp of large hole
mud.wasp:LF hole:LF greatness
There is no formal bracketing of internal phrase structure. Consequently, the above
examples could be construed as [N + N] + N constructions:
[nû’ hámzì] só’lé
large hole of mud wasp
hole:LF mud.wasp:LF greatness
[hámzì nû’] só’lé
large mud wasp of hole
mud.wasp:LF hole:LF greatness
Both internal structures are commonly attested. In cases of formal ambivalence, only the
referential context may clarify which meaning has been invoked.
Like other nouns, possessive pronouns are commonly found in the dependent position of
possessive constructions. An additional formal distinction, that of alienable vs.
inalienable possession, is attested with possessive constructions composed of certain
nouns followed by possessive pronouns (it is not, however, available to constructions
with two typical/non-pronoun nouns; cf. 5.3.3.3):
páà )íí
man:LF 1SG.POSSmy colleaguepáy

There are two categories of object pronouns in Mambay: basic (6.1.3.1) and reflexive
(6.1.3.2).
6.1.3.1 Basic object pronouns
Basic object pronouns are as follows:274Basic object pronouns

3:PFV greet:PFV-1&2PL.OBJhe/she/it greeted us (incl.)Phonological evidence for treating these object pronouns as suffixes is presented in the
section on verb word suffixes (7.3.1.5).
As shown in the table above, the third person singular object pronoun 4 `rú is also attested
as 4 `wú; the variant 4 `wú is associated with informal speech.

are common: a phonologically independent morpheme zìnzá and a suffix 4zíná. Either
form may be used with no change in meaning. Variation between the forms is likely
sociolinguistic rather than linguistic, reflecting a process of contraction that is taking
place; however, the precise factors influencing usage have not been identified (see also
7.3.1.5 for discussion of the formally similar 1&2PL reflexive suffixes).

segmental contrasts. This is shown in the following examples:

Members of a set of reflexive object pronouns are used whenever the object of a simple
clause is co-referential with its subject. Similar to what is found in many other African
languages (Watters 2000:213), reflexive object pronouns in Mambay are composed of the
noun )ínù ‘body, self’ and an inalienable possessive pronoun (6.1.4.2). Reflexive object
pronouns are as follows:

2SGzóó

body:1SG.POSSyou (sg.) greeted yourselfLike reflexive verb suffixes (7.3.1.5), reflexive object pronouns reduce the number of
semantic participants in a transitive verb construction. However, they achieve this using
different strategies: while reflexive suffixes result in the detransitivization of a transitive
verb (7.3.2.1.2), reflexive object pronouns satisfy transitivity requirements by supplying
the transitive verb with an object. The detransitivization strategy is only moderately277productive and is often accompanied by semantic shift (7.3.2.1.2), but the use of reflexive
objects is fully productive.

co-referential) third person pronouns are absent from the reflexive object pronoun
paradigm.","[291, 292, 293, 294, 295]"
"1133.4.3.6 Negation particle yá
The particle yá is used in negation (10.1.2.3). In terms of nasality, it functions as a clitic:
whenever it follows any morpheme ending in a nasalized vowel or nasal consonant,
nasality spreads from that morpheme onto the clitic.

Nasality spreads across morpheme boundaries only in the six contexts described above
(3.4.3.1–3.4.3.6). Even within phonological words, the spread of nasality is sensitive to
morphological boundaries (cf. 2.5.1, 4.1.2.2). For example, nasality does not spread
across prefix-noun or other noun-internal boundaries:
prefix-noun boundary (5.1.2.2):
ná4)áà
nà4rúvò
tí4náánì
tí4kà4ràhgúbean leaves
phlegm, moist object

tâw4nîn4gáhlà7
tôr4nà4múùrákingfisher sp. (cf. gérmù ‘women’)
fish sp. (cf. tâw ‘(male proper name),’ nínù ‘eye,’ gáhlà7
‘faceted’)
maize (cf. tórà ‘seed,’ nà4múùrá ‘jinn’)114Conversely, while nasality spreads across the boundary to the negation clitic yá from the
word that precedes it (3.4.3.6), tonal boundaries remain intact in this context. This is
evident in the following example:
múùrá=yá
silt = NEG
(in: mùú kó múùrá=yá you did not see the silt)
If there were no tonal boundary between the two morphemes, the sequence would
constitute a single tonal word múúràyá with a HLH melody, like other HLH words of
the same shape (4.1.2.2). However, this is not the case.
3.4.3.8 Loss of the nasal feature
There are four contexts in which a nasal feature is lost. In the first case, it is lost from a
consonant (3.4.3.8.1), and in the other cases it is lost from a vowel (3.4.3.8.2–3.4.3.8.4).
3.4.3.8.1 The ideophone plural template
In the plural template used with ideophones (8.5.1), the nasal feature is lost from a
consonant. In this context, the consonant Nm is copied to a position immediately before
an oral vowel íì; as a result, its nasality evaporates and it is realized as .
source ideophonederived ideophoneNmíNn4NmíNn
very thiníì4NmíNn
very thin (pl.)The data contain no examples of the derivation of ideophones beginning with other nasal
consonants.
3.4.3.8.2 Plural marking on nouns
When a plural template containing z (5.5.2) applies to a noun ending in a light syllable
with a nasalized vowel, the nasal feature is lost from that syllable. This happens because
when it is preceded by the obstruent z, the short nasalized vowel is deprived of the
minimal domain required for the hosting of nasality (3.4.2).

breasts3.4.3.8.3 The 1SG inalienable possessive suffix 4í
It appears that when the 1SG inalienable possessive suffix 4í (6.1.4.2) attaches to one of
three obligatorily possessed nouns (5.3.3.2), its nasal feature is lost. As is the case with
plural marking on nouns (3.4.3.8.2), a constraint against a short nasalized vowel after an
obstruent (cf. 3.4.2) is active here.

(see Glossary)The underlying forms of these three nouns have been established with reference to their
shapes throughout the inalienable possession paradigms (see Appendix 1). They may be
historically composed (note the consistent 4zi ending). Still, whatever morphological
complexities may be present, the loss of the suffix’s nasal feature is clear.
An alternative explanation, and one which is ad hoc but admissible, is that the 1SG
inalienable possessive suffix is a floating H tone without segmental support (the deletion
of the excess H tone in )ázì T is discussed in 4.3.1.4).
In the two other examples of nouns ending in an obstruent-V syllable which are found
with inalienable pronominal possession, the suffix 4í retains its nasality.
súgò
ear4í
1SG.POSS.INALsúgí
my ear (inal.)sábà

and b) are unclear, but it is worth noting that neither of the final examples is obligatorily
possessed, and that both refer to body parts rather than social relations.
1163.4.3.8.4 Irregular verbal nouns
Long nasalized vowels found before an obstruent in the context of irregular verbal nouns
(5.9.1.2) alternate with V7. In these cases, the nasal value of the vowel evaporates.

head noun which it follows (cf. 4.1.2.3).

inalienable pronouns and nouns, is described in 5.3.4.2.5.
In most cases, the segmental structure of an inalienable noun-pronoun possessive
construction is a simple amalgamation of the linked form (5.2.2) of the head noun and the
inalienable possessive pronoun.

are summarized in the following subsections according to the segmental context offered
by the linked forms of head nouns they accompany.
Complete paradigms of regular inalienable possession are provided for all shapes in
Appendix 1, and all of the numerous idiosyncratic paradigms are also given.
6.1.4.2.1 With linked forms ending in a long vowel
Inalienable possessive constructions involving nouns with linked forms ending in a long
vowel insert n before the first person singular suffix 4í as a means of avoiding illegal
VVV structures, which are not found elsewhere in the language.

In constructions involving nouns with linked forms ending in a consonant, the second
person singular suffix 4mi is realized as 4Vgm (where V is an echo of the vowel in the
previous syllables, but which carries the High tone of the underlying suffix 4mi). This is a
means of avoiding an illegal CC coda, since no other such structures are found in the
language (2.4.1).

Constructions involving nouns with linked forms ending in an obstruent differ from other
constructions in that the third person singular co-reference/impersonal suffix 4lé is
realized as 4é:

Constructions involving nouns with linked forms ending in a sonorant differ from other
constructions in several ways. First, most CV suffixes that begin with a sonorant displace
the final sonorant of the linked form of the head noun:

d/r alternation more likely reflects a historical d r softening in word-internal positions
other than after r (see 2.1.2.2). However, since 4 `rú is synchronically represented in a
wider range of environments, it has been selected as the underlying form of the third
person singular pronoun.)284Additionally, the 4zíná variant of the first-and-second person plural suffix is optionally
reduced to 4zá when it attaches to n-final linked forms:

nouns are as follows:

fâhzímember of )àzgárà (see Glossary)
member of fààzárà ( ” )
member of fàhzárà ( ” )They pattern differently than other nouns in three ways. First, the nasality on the first
person form (usually marked by the suffixation of the nasalized pronoun 4í) does not
appear in the resulting possessive construction.

This contrasts with intransitive stems, with which reflexive suffixes function
inflectionally (7.3.2.1.1). With transitive stems, the reflexive suffixes appease obligatory
object requirements, resulting in valence reduction; in other words, transitive verbs are
detransitivized. Such verbs are inflected like intransitive verbs belonging to the same

Irregular verbal nouns correspond to intransitive verbs stems. In addition to their
intransitivity (cf. 7.3.2.1), they differ from regular verbal nouns (5.9.1.1) in their
derivational behaviour.
Importantly, there is no synchronic process by which irregular verbal nouns are derived
from verb stems. Historically, irregular verbal nouns appear to have undergone a
historical wave of unevenly applied derivational suffixation along with the rest of the
nouns in the language (5.1.3.2; this has been further described in Anonby 2008). This
process has resulted in irregular, lexicalized verbal nouns as follows:

sùù ‘lie down’ + *4gV%áárà ‘alighting’

show segmental and semantic correspondences to specific verb stems. However, in other
respects they are like nouns in general. Over one hundred fossilized verbal nouns have
been identified in the data; this is out of a total of 1525 non-borrowed, lexicalized nouns.
Fossilized verbal nouns correspond to transitive as well as intransitive verbs.

pullFossilized verbal nouns are like irregular true verbal nouns (5.9.1.2) in that there is no
synchronic process by which they are derived from verb stems.
However, they differ from true verbal nouns (regular and irregular) in three important
ways. First, fossilized verbal nouns cannot participate in verbal constructions, notably
those involving Imperfective verb forms (cf. 7.4.1.1.2); second, although they exhibit
more structural complexity than true verbal nouns, transitivity does not influence their
structure; and third, they are semantically unpredictable.
In the subsections that follow, the morphological structure and semantic values of
fossilized verbal nouns are described (5.9.2.1 and 5.9.2.2). Following this, the direction
of historical noun/verb derivation is considered (5.9.2.3).
5.9.2.1 Morphological structure
The structures of fossilized verbal nouns are a significant subset of those found with
nouns in general (5.1). The inventory of CV shapes of fossilized verbal nouns in the data
is as follows:234CV shapeverbal nounCVV

undergone a historical wave of unevenly applied derivational suffixation (Anonby 2008,
5.1.3.2; but see 5.9.2.3). However, the structure of fossilized verbal nouns is more
varied. For example, while irregular true verbal nouns contain a maximum of two
syllables (5.9.1.2), there are many fossilized verbal nouns with three-syllable stems.
Also, in addition to historically fused suffixes (5.1.3.2), there are also two semantically
salient suffixes found principally with fossilized verbal nouns: 4(g)VrV and 4zi. 4(g)VrV
is a fused generic suffix found with nouns historically derived from intransitive verbs,
and is described in 5.1.3.2. Examples of this suffix are:
fìmgórò

cf. sòò get hot, boil, sòògá hotness, smithyheaviness

heatThe suffix 4zi, which is formally reminiscent of the noun plural template (5.5.2.1), verbal
plural person affix 4zí (7.3.1.1) and the verbal extension 4zi (7.2.4.4), appears to have a
pluractional meaning when it is found in the context of fossilized verbal nouns. With a
single exception (lóózìrá ‘tiredness, difficulty’; see list below), it is found only in
fossilized verbal nouns derived from transitive verbs.

contain obligatory prefixes (see 5.1.2 for a discussion of noun prefixes). These prefixes
are not attested with irregular true verbal nouns (5.9.1.2). The prefix nà4 is quite
common with fossilized verbal nouns, and all fossilized verbal nouns with this prefix are
derived from transitive verbs. The single example of a verbal noun with the prefix tì4 is,
in contrast, derived from an intransitive verb.

In contrast to true verbal nouns (5.9.1), fossilized verbal nouns are semantically
unpredictable. True verbal nouns minimally refer to a verbal action or state which is
brought about by the subject (whether agent or patient), and this is the case for some
fossilized verbal nouns.

derived. This is evident for the following examples of fossilized verbal nouns:

It is often difficult to establish the direction of historical derivation between fossilized
verbal nouns and corresponding verb stems. In contrast to what happens with regular
verbal nouns, whose derivation from verb stems is marked by the possibility of
suffixation with the dummy object suffix 4na (5.9.1.1), there is no productive synchronic
affixation on fossilized verbal nouns. Rather, as demonstrated by the previous sections
(5.9.2.1, 5.9.2.2), the morphological structure and semantic value of fossilized verbal
nouns is varied, and does not correspond systematically with related verb roots.
Obviously, there are two historical derivational possibilities for each pair: verb-to-noun,
and noun-to-verb. On the one hand, it is technically possible that noun-to-verb derivation
has taken place, and that verbs have been historically derived from corresponding nouns
by means of CVC(CV) morphological templates.

Synchronically, however, verbs which are demonstrably derived from nouns or any other
part of speech are disyllabic and always have LH tone in their basic Perfective form
(7.4.1.1.1.1).

fossilized verbal nouns reflect a historical noun-to-verb derivation (or, at least, one that
functioned in the same way as the synchronic noun-to-verb derivation).
On the other hand, there are a couple of modest indicators of historical verb-to-noun
derivation. One indicator is, with one exception, the limitation of fossilized verbal noun
prefixes to nà4 (5.9.2.1 above). This is very different from nouns in general, with which
any of ten different prefixes may constitute an obligatory component (5.1.2.1). If many or
most corresponding verbs were derived from nouns, a range of prefixes would likely be
represented.
A second indicator of historical verb-to-noun derivation is the repeated occurrence of
more than one noun corresponding to a single verb.","[248, 249, 250, 251, 252, 253, 254, 255]"

alienable possessive pronouns to fill in gaps (see Appendix 1). Gaps reflect usage:
singular forms are more complete than plural pronominal forms, and address forms (‘my
friend,’ etc.) are more complete than non-address forms.
The paradigm of túù ‘mother’ has, in addition to other irregularities, a suppletive root.

1925.3.4.2.4 Tonal structure
Like the segments of inalienable noun-pronoun possessive constructions, which are fused
into a single phonological word, a simplified tone melody is found on inalienable nounpronoun possessive constructions. The tone melody of the resulting forms is dependent
both on the tone of the linked noun roots and the tone of the possessive pronouns.
5.3.4.2.4.1 Linked forms corresponding to HL nouns
When a linked form corresponding to a HL-toned noun is fused with a H-toned
inalienable possessive pronoun, the resulting melody of the composite phonological word
is usually H. This is shown by constructions involving káálà ‘head’ (linked forms are
accounted for in 5.2.2):

constructions, is the most common. The second and third forms (ex. páà zínzá ~ páà

pronoun dùgú in that the tonal form of its possessed head noun—as in alienable
constructions—is not fused with the suffix. Still, as is sometimes the case with dùgú, a
semantically inalienable construction is expressed (6.1.4.2). Although the issue has been193probed, no semantic difference has been identified among the three tonal forms found
with constructions involving the noun páà or other kinship terms.
However, when the same tonal forms are found with body parts which can be used to
indicate location (5.13), the third form (only) indicates locative (see 5.3.1) rather than
part-whole semantic relation. This is shown in reference to káálà ‘head’:

Compound nouns are extremely common in Mambay; of the non-borrowed lexicalized

differences between compound nouns and noun phrases are reviewed (5.4.1). The
morphological and semantic constitution of compound nouns is then examined in 5.4.2
and 5.4.3.
Pluralization of compound nouns is described in 5.5.2.4, and the behaviour of compound

object is different item than the one which the listener expects. In the following cases,
the object’s final syllable is lengthened and a low tone is associated with it.

10.1.2.4 The topicalization particle rè

boastingThe morphological templates which produce linked forms may also add phonological
information, but it is predictable. For example, in linked forms of nouns with certain CV
shapes, the noun’s final vowel is replaced with a uniform vowel i (5.2.2.2.4, 5.2.2.2.5).drum

constructions are highly irregular. These forms are addressed in the discussion on
inalienable possession (5.3.4.2, 6.1.4.2).
Linked forms are always produced with a subsequent noun phrase element (5.2.1).
Because of this, most of the examples below are given in this context. While there are
many possible items with which linked forms may be found, the first singular possessive
pronoun )íí ‘my (al.)’ has been used throughout for the sake of simplicity and uniformity.
5.2.2.1 Tone melody
Tonally, the melody of the linked form is often the same as that of the free form, although
it may associate differently depending on the availability of tone-bearing units (4.1.2.2).
This is the case for linked forms corresponding to nouns whose free forms are associated
with H, L and HL tone melodies. (As noted in the previous paragraph, the pronoun )íí
‘my (al.)’ has been used throughout to provide a natural context for example linked
forms).","[188, 189]"
"9.1 Numerals
In Mambay, as in other languages, numerals are words used for counting. Numerals
often modify nouns, whether as a dependent element in a noun phrase or as a predicate of
a verbless clause (9.1.1.1). Occasionally, they appear to function adverbially (9.1.1.2); in
addition, they can fulfill mathematical operations even when there is no syntactic head in
view (9.1.1.3). Basic numerals (9.1.2.1), which are used for values from one to ten, are
as follows:
one

9.1.2.1.2.
409In the following sections, various aspects of numerals are described. First, the syntactic
distribution of numerals is defined (9.1.1). Following this, numeral categories ranging
from basic numerals to those with higher values are examined (9.1.2.1–9.1.2.4). Three
additional elements in a description of numerals in Mambay include proportions
(9.1.2.5), ordinal nouns (9.1.3), and other nouns with numerical value (9.1.4).","[426, 427]"
"339happening. The Future tense (typically; see 7.4.1.2.1) as well as negated forms of
Indicative verbs (7.5) are expressed using Irrealis pronouns (this grouping is defended in
7.4.1.2). All other Indicative verb forms fall under the domain of Realis.
Among Realis verb forms, a distinction is made between Perfective (7.4.1.1.1) and
Imperfective (7.4.1.1.2) aspects. Perfective forms communicate events which have been
completed in reference to a given point in time, and Imperfective forms refer to events
which happen but which have not been completed in reference to a given point in time.
Perfective forms are represented by three distinct tenses (basic Perfective, Perfect and
Pluperfect), but there is only one basic Imperfective tense. The two aspects differ
formally in several respects. First of all, the segmental shape of the Perfective is the verb
stem, but that of the Imperfective is the verbal noun (5.9). Secondly, while the third
person is invariably marked in the Perfective with a zero pronoun, it is marked in the
Imperfective with a segmental pronoun )à whenever there is no nominal subject
(7.4.1.1.2). Thirdly, the negated form of the Perfective is found with a LH pronoun, but
negated Imperfective forms are found with a HL pronoun (7.5.3).
The Optative and the five Indicative tenses (basic Perfective, Perfect, Pluperfect,
Imperfective and Future) are distinguished from one another by contrastive tone melodies
and by the inventory of verbal suffixes which may found with each (7.3.1). The tone
melodies associated with the possible forms of a given verb fall into six tonal sets or
classes (7.3.2.2). If the tone melody is known for the basic Perfective, Perfect and
Future, melodies for the remaining forms can be predicted. Concerning the inventory of
verbal suffixes, reflexive suffixes (7.3.1.2) are obligatorily found with Perfect and
Pluperfect forms of intransitive verbs, and optionally found with Future and Optative
forms of intransitive verbs. Further, the Perfect forms of transitive verbs always take the
suffix 4rì, and Imperfective forms of transitive verbs must take the dummy object suffix 4
na if there is no explicit object.
An additional minor verb form, a Realis Future, is found uniquely with the verb vè ‘go’
(7.3.3.1.2). It is composed of an Imperfective pronoun and a Future verb stem.
Each of the basic infectional categories is presented in the sections below (7.4.1–7.4.2).
Negative verb forms are considered separately (7.5). Criteria used for distinguishing verb
forms, all of which have been presented in this section, are summarized in the following

"8.4 Adjectives
Adjectives play an important role as noun modifiers in noun phrases and attributive
predicates (5.14.2, 10.1.3.3). Adjectives are syntactically distinct from nouns (8.4.1,
10.1.3.2, 10.1.3.3) and ideophonic adverbs (8.3), and although there is overlap in attested
morphological structures, the frequency of these structures is very different among the
classes.
Of the four word classes in which ideophones are found in Mambay, that of adjectives is
the most inherently ideophonic (cf. 8.2). In fact, it is difficult to establish the existence of
adjectives which are not ideophonic. In many Niger-Congo languages, the category of
adjective is restricted to a small, closed set of basic vocabulary items (Creissels
2000:249). In Mambay, however, the category labelled as adjective contains an open set
of items, and non-ideophonic core vocabulary is the exception rather than the norm. The390following items could be considered “real” adjectives, since they express core concepts
and since it is hard to establish an ideophonic contribution to their phonological structure:
fyàh
gáà
syáàfree, cheap
simple, only
femaleImportantly, however, there is no discernable syntactic or morphological distinction
between such adjectives and those whose ideophonic nature is transparent. It is true that
all the adjectives in the above list are monosyllabic; however, this selection is as likely as
not a result of the fact that the ideophonic nature of monosyllabic adjectives in Mambay
is harder to identify because there is little or no place for repetition, a phenomenon which
is otherwise common among ideophones.
Considering the overwhelmingly ideophonic nature of the class of adjectives as a whole,
and considering the structural similarity among core and peripheral members of the
adjective lexicon, all adjectives are addressed together in this section.","[407, 408]"

"5.12.1.1 Canonical names
There are exactly ten Mambay canonical personal names (nà4wâgrá) in common usage.
Four of the names are for males, and six are for females. Birth order, parent’s nà4wâgrá,
and a child’s temperament are factors which play into the choice of the name. This name
also emphasizes a person’s membership in the ethnic group. The four canonical personal
names for males are:
kwéé
kà%ákàmì
tâwThe six female canonical personal names are:
àrá
%èví
gaFm)ìzá
pàná
nàgáAll of the canonical names contain two morae: either two light syllables or one heavy
syllable. While male canonical names exhibit four tone melodies (H, L, HL, LH), all of
the female canonical names are LH.
For married women, the augmentative/female prefix tí4 (5.8.2) is normally used with the
name as a means of conveying respect:
tí4 àrá
tí4%èví
tí4gaFmtî’zá

Situational names are given as a way of marking the circumstances surrounding a child’s
birth: for example, they may be used to respond to a lie or an insult, to complain, or to
show thankfulness. Most such names are unique to individuals, and they are formed in
the same way for males and females. One situational name comprised of a noun has been
attested (nà4kàrá ‘cane, guide’), but most names are comprised of a complete clause.

Almost all Mambay now claim adherence to either Islam or Christianity (1.1.3.4), and
this is reflected in the normative use of religious names. The Mambay associate Fulfulde
with Islam, and French with Christianity; consequently, it is from these two languages
that religious names are selected and applied along the religious lines within the ethnic
group. Interestingly, religious names tend to conform to the CV and tonal norms of the
Mambay canonical names (cf. 5.12.1.1): those names that are more than two syllables
often have short (two-mora) forms, and short names are pronounced with LH tone.","[264, 265]"
