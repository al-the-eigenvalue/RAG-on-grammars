wál'each'
'upper' (cf. kór N M 'top, surface')
'topmost, uppermost, high'
'far, further, beyond'
'near, close'
'each, every'Nouns modified by the adjective wál are usually followed by the adverbial ba
'any' (4.10.4), i.e. nin walba 'each man, every man'. For some speakers this
combination is frozen into a composite attributive adjective. This can be seen
from subject marking, where instead of nin waliba with the nominative suffix -i
attaching to the adjective (as the last element in the nominal), the form used is
nín walbi (←walba-i), where the nominative case suffix attaches after the
adverbial.
Another element which is intermediate between an attributive adjective
and an adverbial is the word uun 'some, other, only, just, mere(ly)', discussed in
4.10.5. This word appears adjective-like as a post-nominal modifier, e.g.:
(101)már uun 'sometime or other'
méel uun 'someplace or other'
wáx uun 'something or other'(már N M 'time')
(méel N F 'place'
(wáx N M 'thing')4.4.4 Agreement features
Adjectives show no gender differentiation in agreement with nouns but the
reduplication process described in 3.5 marks plural agreement, e.g. nirnán
yaryâr 'small men', naagó waawèyn 'big women'. The use of these reduplicated
plural forms is subject to some variation, with the tendency being that the longer
the adjective the less likely speakers are to use the reduplicated forms. Because
of the phrasal operation of case marking in Somali (described in 4.1.1.4)
modifying adjectives do not agree in case with the head noun: as with all noun
phrases only the last element carries case marking. I f the adjective is the last
element then subject marking will apply in the usual way, i.e. to lower any high
tones in the adjective and since all regular adjectives end in a consonant, to add
the nominative suffix -/' described for nouns in 4.1.1.4. See for example:
Ab solutive case
dhèer
wanaagsán
yárNominative case
dheeri
wanaagsani
yari'tall'
'good'
'small'GRAMMATICAL CATEGORIES109Note that the purely attributive adjectives, except for wál 'each', end in vowels,
and thus do not show the nominative suffix but still have lowered tones, e.g.
savé ABS 'topmost' → scire NOM (but wál ABS 'each' →wali NOM).
4.5Verbal appositionsIn Somali as in other closely related languages like Boni, Rendille, Elmolo,
Dasenach (Appleyard 1990) and Arbore (Hayward 1984)36 there are pre-verbal
morphemes which semantically govern oblique elements of the predication much
in the way that nominal adpositions do in other languages. In fact these
elements functionally parallel nominal postpositions and oblique case suffixes in
less closely related Cushitic languages like Oromo (Owens 1985). The four
morphemes are given below with their main meanings:
ú
kú
ká
lá'to, for'
'in, into, on, at, with (by means of)'
'from, away from, out o f
'with (in company with)'As we can see, the English glosses are prepositions and these pre-verbal
morphemes serve very similar functions. These include marking nominals as
having the semantic roles of location (102) & (103), source (104), goal (105),
beneficiary (106), instrument (107), manner (108) and comitative (109), where
the morphemes and relevant governed nominals are underlined:
(102)(103)( 104)(105)Wúxuukáshaqeeyaa warshádda.
Wáxa+uu ká shaqeeyaa warshád-da

"GRAMMATICAL CATEGORIES674.1.2 Names
Names are nouns: they have inherent gender and are case marked, as we have
seen. Names do not normally occur in plural forms, with determiners, or as
heads of restrictive relative clauses, except in special circumstances, for example
Caligée 'which Ali?' and its possible reply:
(32)Cáligli Berbera jóogi jiray
Cáli-kíi Berbera jóogi
jiray
Ali-the
Berbera stay:in:INF used
'the Ali who used to stay in Berbera'Many personal names are of Arabic origin, for example the male names
Áxmed, Cábdi, Cáli, Maxámed, Sacíid and female names Faadúmo ('Fatima'),
Cáasho ('Ayesha'), and Maryámo ('Miriam'). Somali names are also regularly
used, for example, the male names Róoble 'Rain Bearer' and Warsáme 'Bearer
of Good News' and female names like Káaha 'Distant Light, Dawn', Déeqa
'Gift' and Hódan 'Wealth'. The naming system for both men and women
consists of a personal name followed by the father's personal name and then the
grandfather's name, forming a compound genitive list ' X (child) o f Y (child) of
Z', etc. The three names in normal use can be extended to a complete lineage.
Women do not change their names on marriage. Since case marking is phrasal
only the last element in a complex NP is case marked and thus only the last
name carries genitive case, the preceding names being in the absolutive:
(33)(a)(b)Maxámed
Axmed
Mohamed:ABS Ahmed.ABS
'Mohamed Ahmed Hasan'
Câasha
Xásan
Ayesha:ABS
Hasan:ABS
'Ayesha Hasan Ahmed'Xasán
Hasan :GEN
Axméd
Ahmed:GENNicknames are commonly used and are useful since many people
share a relatively small stock of the commonest personal names. The nicknames
may reflect an attribute of the person's physique or character or may be tied to
specific incidents, perhaps in childhood. The nicknames are usually also nouns,
e.g. madóobe N M 'the black one' in Aadan Madóobe 'Adam the Dark' or
musmàar N M 'nail' in Cali Musmàar 'Ali "" N a i f "" . Such nicknames are
frequently in public use. Name and nickname combinations act accentually like
compound nouns (5.4.1), thus these examples have just one high tone on bothSOMALI68names. This allows contrasts like the following, pointed out to me by B.W.
Andrzejewski:
(34)(a)
(b)Cali Khàyr
'Ali Khayr' (whose nickname is khàyr N M 'goodness')
Cali Khàyr
'Ali (son) of Khayr'4.1.3 Independent pronouns
The independent pronouns, which are also sometimes called substantive or
emphatic pronouns, contrast in function with the clitic or verbal pronouns
described in 4.2. The independent pronouns are grammatically nouns. They are
case marked, have inherent gender and show the syntax of nouns, including
functioning as subject and object, occurring as heads of relative clauses, being
focused by the nominal focus words bàa and ayàa, and occurring in isolation as
one word utterances. In Standard Somali they occur with the suffixed nonremote definite article -kal-ta but may occur in an unsuffixed short form when
followed by a conjunction or focus word. The suffixed and short forms are
shown below, in (35) followed by the verb phrase conjunction -na 'and' and in
(36) by the focus word bàa:
(35)(a)(36)(a)adígana
adi-ka-na
you:SG-the-and
'and you...""
adigàa
adi-ka-bàa
you: SG-the-FOC
'YOU' (focused)(b)(b)adna
adi-na
you:SG-and
'and you
adàa
adi-bàa
you:SG -FOC
'YOU' (focused)The set of independent pronouns is given below, with the determiner
separated off by a hyphen to show the short form. They provide an eight-person
system, with EXC 'exclusive' meaning 'not including the addressee(s)' and INC
'inclusive' meaning 'including the addressee(s)'. As the suffixed determiners
show, all of the pronouns are masculine in gender, except iyáda 'she, her'.

idin-ka
iyá-gaThe independent pronouns can occur with other determiners like demonstratives
and even the interrogative determiner, for example anigée? 'which me?7, an
expression that may be used to protest when unfairly accused.
As described in chapter 9, independent pronouns like other nominals can
occur with coreferential clitic pronouns, for example:
(38)Adiga, maxàa ku keenày?
adi-ka
maxáy+bàa
you:IPRO-the
what+FOC
'You, what brought you?'ku
you:CPROkeenây
broughtSince independent pronouns normally occur with the suffixed determiner, we
deal with subject marking in the discussion of case marking on determiners in
4.6.
4.1.4 Numerals
The cardinal numerals are nouns: they are case-marked, have inherent gender,
allow the full range of suffixed determiners and show nominal syntax, including
functioning as subjects, objects, heads of relative clauses, etc. The set of
numerals 1-10 and examples of higher numerals are given below in the
absolutive case; they are case marked regularly as described in 4.1.1.

its prepause or isolation form with AP2; before other elements the absolutive
has A P I , i.e. labá. The numerals sagáal 'nine', tobán 'ten', labaatán 'twenty'
and boqól 'hundred' undergo the rule of Accent Lowering (3.4.3).
The numeral 'one' has several suppletive forms. When counting, the
numeral is ków, which becomes kóob when followed by iyo 'and' as shown in
(40). When used with nouns this word is replaced by hål 'one', e.g. hål
baabúur 'one truck'. When the numeral occurs alone as the argument of a verb,
it is replaced by mid 'one', e.g. mid kèenV 'Bring one!' This word mid is also
used in isolation when a verb is understood:

(a man's name)
(a man's name)There is some variation in the use of these vocatives because of their sensitivity
to pragmatic factors: their use reflects the speaker's estimation of the
relationship with the addressee, including such factors as solidarity, respect,
affection, etc. The distinction between names and nouns is, of course, itself
subject to speaker control, for example in animal fables where we find animals
addressing each other, using nouns for species with name vocatives, e.g.
Shimbirèy 'Bird!' and Shinniyèy 'Bee!'.
When nouns form noun phrases, case is marked phrasally, i.e. just once
on the final element of the noun phrase. Since noun phrases are head initial in
Somali, this means that the exponents of case may be marked not on the noun
but on modifying non-nominal elements such as determiners, adjectives, and
subordinate clause verbs. In subsequent sections we shall see the effect of this
phrasal case marking on a range of non-nominal categories. When the case
marking occurs on this phrase final position, the noun occurs in the default
absolutive case, as we can see in the subject marked noun phrases in the (b)
sentences below:
(29)(a)(30)(a)(31)(a)(b)
(b)(b)nin
nin

[NOM]Only when the noun nin 'man' stands alone, as in (29), is case marked on it; in
(30) the marking shifts to the determiner ka 'the', and in (31) to the adjective
dhèer 'tall'. In (30) and (31) the head noun nin shows absolutive case, though
the whole NP is subject.","[80, 81]"
"Sentence-level intonation patterns do exist in Somali and carry signals of the
speaker's attitude and of emotional colouring, in ways that have not been
studied so far. However the use of pitch at word level means that intonation has
a smaller communicative load than in languages like English.
A fourth feature of the tonal system is the relatively restricted set of tone
patterns. As noted by Andrzejewski (1964, 1968, 1979) and Hyman (1981), all
roots of common nouns, verbs and adjectives have one of three basic tone
patterns in their citation, or isolation, form, which we can represent as:
(32) Pattern 1 : High on the last mora, Low on all others
Pattern 2: High on the penultimate mora, Low on all others.
Pattern3: Lowonallmoras.
As we shall see in subsequent chapters, knowing the declension and gender of a
noun or the conjugation ofa verb, allows one to predict the tone pattern ofthe
basic form. There are of course some complications, especially in other
categories: some proper nouns, for example, also allow a fourth pattern:
(33) Pattern 4: High on the first and last mora, Low on all others, e.g.
Bôoramé [ ←Bóoramć] the Somali town of Borama.
Furthermore, as we discuss in chapter 3, some sentence type markers, like the
question word ma, have variable tone depending on the presence of High tones
in their environment. Nevertheless it is very clear that the mapping between
tone patterns and words is very restricted and predictable: Somali does not
show the full range of tonal patterns we would expect if each syllable or mora
were independent of others in the word.
The basic tone patterns of roots are changed by grammatical or
derivational processes. This will become very clear in later chapters, but we can
select two typical examples here. When nouns are assigned case as part of23PHONOLOGICAL UNITSsentences, this is marked largely by tone. Example (34) below shows the case
forms of the proper noun Cáli ' M ' revealing the associated tonal and suffix
changes:
(34) absolutive case (= citation):
Cali
nominative case:
Cali
genitive case: Cali
vocative: Cáli or Cáliyôw [←*Cáliyów]
We discuss accentual case marking further in chapter 3. As a second example
we take one ofthe derivational processes where an affix is used to create verbs
from nouns and adjectives, in this case the suffix which has the form -êe (Falling
tone) in the imperative form used for verb citation forms. The addition of this
suffix flattens any High tones in the stem to Low, leaving the derived verb with
Pattern 2 in (32) above, High on the penultimate mora. This is phonetically
realised as a Falling tone on the final long vowel. We can see examples ofthis:
(35)cásho
N
'eveningmeal'
cashêe V
dháb N 'truth' dhabêe V 'confirm'
dhêer ADJ 'long' dheerêe V 'move fast''eattheeveningmeal'In fact a wide range of morphological and syntactic processes change the basic
tone patterns of word roots. These changes will be described in the relevant
sections of this book. What is clear is that tone patterns in Somali are wordbased and reflect a combination ofthe word's inherent syntactic class and the
tonal markers ofgrammatical information.
These basic features allow us to commentbriefly on the typology ofthe
Somali tone system. If we adopt the traditional distinction between intonation
languages, tone languages and pitch accent languages, it seems clear that Somali
is not an intonation language. As we have seen, Somali does not use pitch
patterns for the types of sentence level information that we find in English and
other European languages. Somali uses tone to make contrasts of meaning at
the word level. However, the position of Somali in relation to the distinction
between tone languages proper and pitch accent languages is less immediately
obvious. We may take the defining characteristics ofpitch accent languages like
Japanese to be as follows: words may have no more than one accent per word;
this accent is realised by pitch prominence; and the accent is relatively
unaffected by intonation (Cruttenden 1986). The features we have seen in
Somali word roots: their restricted tonal patterns, in particular the fact that
common nouns, verbs and adjectives contain only one High tone in their basicSOMALI24form, makes an accentual analysis seem plausible and such analyses have been
proposed by Hyman (1981) and Banti (1988b). The basic idea ofthis type of
approach is that underlyingly, or lexically, Somali roots have no inherent tone.
Rules of accent placement determine the position of a single accented mora in
each root, which is then phonetically realised as a high pitch segment. These
rules ofaccent placement are governed by grammatical information, for example
what syntactic class the root is, which declension or conjugation, etc.
Subsequently morphological and syntactic rules may change the placement of
this accented mora and thus ofthe associated High tone. This seems a plausible
line ofapproach for Somali and we discuss it further in chapter 3. What is clear
is that Somali uses tone quite differently from Asian tone languages like Chinese
and Korean and with significant differences from better known types of African
tone languages like Igbo, Hausa, or the Bantu languages. Similar tone accent
systems have been reported for other Cushitic languages, notably Oromo
(Andrzejewski 1970, Owens 1980, 1982, 1985, Banti 1988b).
Tone is not marked in the official Somali orthography. In the rest of this
book we will mark the tone of words and constructions recorded from speech
but not attempt to tone mark texts and examples taken from published Somali
sources. We will adopt a conservative strategy in the marking of tones,
identifying the three 'surface' tones on syllables, rather than the underlying
moraic structure, as follows:
(36)High tone:
Low tone:
Falling tone:on short vowels
on long vowels and diphthongs
on short vowels
on long vowels and diphthongs
on long vowels and diphthongsά
áa
a
aa
àaáy
ay
àyWe will only mark underlying moraic forms, for example the sequence of High
and Low tones underlying the Falling tone, when discussing the details of the
tonal system.","[37, 38, 39]"

'president' from màdax NM 'head, leader' and wèyn ADJ 'big'. Another
consists of nouns formed from simple verbs by an agentive suffix -e, e.g.
baré 'teacher' from bár v 'teach'.
Some examples are:

agaasimé
danjiré
tuké
xakamé'father'

agaasimayáal
danjirayáal
tukayáal
xakamayàal'fathers'
'directors'
'ambassadors
'crows'
'bridles'In addition to these seven major declensions there are a small number of
nouns which have idiosyncratic ways of forming plurals. Some loans from
Arabic, for example, maintain for some speakers their Arabic form of plurals,
e.g. kúrsi M 'chair', kuraasi F 'chairs'; mârkab M 'ship', maraakiib F 'ships'. It
is interesting though that these exhibit gender polarity. Some speakers however
'somalicize' these nouns further by placing them in declension 2A, allowingGRAMMATICAL CATEGORIES63kursiyó 'chairs'. Another small group form their plural by suffixing -aan or -an
and changing AP2 to A P I :
(19)úgax
dhágax
qálinF 'egg 1
M 'stone'
M 'pen'ugxàan
dhagxâan (dhagxàn)
qalmàanF
F
F'eggs'
'stones'
'pens'Again these forms are under pressure from more regular plural formation rules
and qálin can be treated as a declension 2 noun and pluralized as qalimmó. A
third group, perhaps only two words but in very common use, are masculine
non-polar nouns with A P I in both singular and plural: réer 'family', reeró
'families' and waláal 'brother', walaaló 'brothers'. These nouns undergo
Accent Lowering in both singular and plural.
The basic system of seven declensions is affected by regional variation in
two ways that we cannot adequately explore here. The first is that for some
nouns there is variation within Standard Somali about the declension they
belong to. For example the noun tùug M 'thief is in some varieties treated as a
declension 4 noun and given a plural tuugág M 'thieves', in others as declension
5, giving túug F 'thieves', while in still others it is a declension 2 noun, giving
tuuggó F 'thieves'. The second is that other dialects have quite different
distributions of plural forms, including some suffixes not found in Standard
Somali; see Banti (1985) and Lamberti (1986) for some details of these.
4.1.1.4 Case
As described briefly in chapter 3, the marking of case on nouns is largely
accentual, with some use of suffixes. The basic unmarked case we termed the
absolutive (ABS). This is the case nouns show when in isolation, as objects of
verbs and adpositions, or when focused. It is convenient to treat it as the base
form because it is the most basic form morphologically and also because its
accentual patterns are less predictable than the other cases. There is a general
tendency for feminine singular nouns to have A P I in the absolutive, while
masculine singular have AP2 and all plurals, A P I .
However there are
exceptions: masculine nouns in declensions 2 B and 7 have A P I in the singular
while declension 6 nouns have AP2 in the plural. The other cases are more
predictable and can best be viewed as modifications to the underlying absolutive
form. In chapter 3 we gave the following typical accentual case marking
pattern:
(20)
ABS→Nominative (NOM)
AP3Genitive (GEN)
APIVocative (VOC)
AP464SOMALIAll nouns follow this pattern for the genitive case and for vocatives marked by
accentual change alone. We discuss other vocatives below. Most nouns follow
this pattern for nominative case too except for non-plural feminine nouns ending
in -o and masculine nouns ending in -e which have AP2 in the nominative, for
example hooyó F ABS 'mother' → hóoyo NOM; tuké M ABS 'crow' → túke NOM.
In addition to these accentual changes the case system involves suffixes.
In the nominative and genitive cases suffixes attach to phonologically specified
classes of nouns. In the nominative, feminine nouns ending in a consonant have
a suffix -/, for example nàag F ABS 'woman' → naagi NOM. In the genitive
case, feminine nouns not ending in -o add a suffix -eed, (or -yeed i f the noun
ends in i), for example:
(21) áf shimbiréed
âf
s hi mbiré ed
mouth:M:SG:ABS
bird:F:SG:GEN
'mouth of bird, a beak'
A few nouns for domestic animals, e.g. ló ' F 'cattle', daméer F 'female donkey',
hál 'female camel' take a suffix -aad, e.g.
(22)caanó lo 'áad
caanó
lo 'áad
milk:M:COLL:ABS cattle:F:SG:GEN
'cow's milk1Polar masculine plurals ending in o, formed from feminine singular nouns, have
a genitive suffix -od, e.g.
(23)hádal naagóod
hàdal
naagóod
talk:M:SG:ABS women :M:PL: GEN
'women's talk'Names and nouns used as forms of direct address occur in the vocative
case. There are two basic forms: vocatives by accentual change alone, as we
have already seen, and those formed with suffixes. Cross-cutting this formal
distinction there are two functional classes: the first is used for people's names,
nouns of kinship and friendship, for the names of occupations when used
respectfully, and for the names of God. This class reflects degrees o f solidarity
and/or respect. The second class is more neutral and tends to be used with
common nouns. We can call the first class name vocatives and the second nounGRAMMATICAL CATEGORIES65vocatives, and show the relationship between the formal and functional classes
as follows:
(24)
Name
NounAP change
√-Suffix
√
√Turning to suffixed forms first, both name and noun vocatives have two forms.
One is used with feminine singular nouns, including feminine collectives and
mass nouns which take singular concord, and the other with masculine singular
nouns and plurals:

These suffixes also occur in short vowel variants: -èylàylòy. When name
vocative suffixes are added to stems ending in the short vowels e, a or o the
vowel is deleted, losing any associated tone. Stems ending in /' will usually have
an epenthetic consonant y inserted. All vocative suffixes append their own AP
without altering the stem's original AP. 27 See below for some examples of these

As described in chapter 8, for the most part verbs in subordinate clauses are
distinguished from corresponding main clause forms by a combination of
accentual pattern and, to a lesser degree, segmental inflection. The differences
are caused by the intersection of two marking systems. The first marks the
syntactic distinction between main and subordinate clauses; the second is case
marking. Clauses may perform various sentential functions such as subject,
object and adverbial and consequently are case marked. Again, as with
nominals, this case marking applies to the final or rightmost element in the
constituent. Since subordinate clauses usually are verb final, this case marking
falls on and influences verbal inflection.33 In outlining the system it is useful to
distinguish between relative clauses on the one hand, and other subordinate
clauses like complement clauses, and adverbial clauses introduced by elements
like márka 'when', haddíi ' i f , ilaa 'until', etc. All clauses share many of the
features we describe but relative clauses have some extra formal distinctions, as
we shall see.
The first marking system differentiates main clause verbs from subordinate
clause verbs in their basic absolutive case. The differences are both segmental
and accentual. The segmental differences are limited to forms where the main
verb ends in -aa; here the subordinate clause forms end in -o, or optionally -id
for 2SG. The paradigms affected include present general, and present
progressive, as shown below in the subordinate clause forms of súg 'wait for':1SG/3SGM

main clause verb accentual patterns:
(84) (a) The last syllable becomes high tone if short; falling tone if long.
(b) If the last syllable is already high, as in some negative paradigms, it remains
so.
Thus we can compare the main clause and subordinate verbs in the (a) and (b)
pair below:
(85)(a)(b)Wùm keenaa.
waa+uu keenaa
DM+he
brings:MAIN:PRES GEN:3SG M
'He brings it'
innu keenó
in-uu keenó
that-he brings:SUBORD:PRES GEN:3SG M
'that he brings it'We can show the second marking system, of case, by comparing subject
marked and absolutive subordinate verb forms. Segmentally, subject marked
verb forms have the same ending as main clause verbs; in other words the
change -aa to -ol-id found in absolutive forms does not occur. Accentually,
subject marking follows the main rule for nominals: the verb becomes AP3, i.e.
any high tones are lowered. Since most main clause positive verbs have AP3,
this means that subject marked positive subordinate verbs have the same form as
the corresponding main clause forms. However, as can be seen from the
paradigms earlier in this section, many main clause negative verb forms have
high tones and for these verbs, subject marked subordinate clause forms (with
AP3) are distinct from main clause forms, e.g.:
(86)(a)(b)Inaanán arkini waa yàab
in-aan-aan arkini
waa
that-not-I
saw:NEG:SUBJ DM
That I did not see it is surprising.""
Má 'aan arkin.
má-aan arkin
not-I
saw:NEG
T did not see it.'yàab
surpriseGRAMMATICAL CATEGORIES95Since the clause in (86a) is subject of the sentence, the verb arkini carries the
markers of subject case: AP3, i.e. all low tones, and the subject case suffix -i
described in 4.1.1.4. The corresponding main clause verb arkin in (86b) has
neither of these inflectional features.
We can see in this asymmetry between positive and negative verbs the
result of an interaction between different uses of the same accentual distinction.
high versus low is a marker of absolutive versus subject case in nominals, while
in the verbal system low tones are characteristic of positive paradigms and high
tones of negative paradigms. When the two systems interact in the case
marking of clauses, we find that subordinate absolutive forms and main negative
forms pattern together accentually, while subordinate subject forms and main
positive forms are accentually similar.
All subordinate clauses verbs are case-marked in this way. Relative clause
verbs, however, show some extra agreement features compared with other
clause verbs. The structure of relative clauses is described in 8.1; we might note
in particular that the relative clause follows the nominal it modifies and that
there is no relative pronoun: the position of the relativised element, coreferential
with the head nominal, is marked by a gap. Our first observation is that, as
phrase final elements in the NP, relative clause verbs are marked for the role of
their head nominal in the main clause. Compare the following where we
schematically represent the relative clause structure (REL = relative clause):

Grammatical CategoriesIn this chapter we outline the main grammatical categories or word classes of
Somali. We concentrate here on the morphology ofthe basic members ofeach
category, leaving those members derived by productive rules ofword formation
to chapter 5 and discussion oftheir phrasal syntax to chapters 6 and 7. Somali
is characterised by a high degree of inflectional complexity, especially in the
verbal system, and while sometimes it is possible to capture generalisations with
rules, often these rules would be so complicated that it is more effective to
present the forms in a paradigmatic display.
We identify ten basic categories, with the following abbreviations:
(1) Noun (N)
Clitic pronoun (CPRO)
Verb (V)
Adjective (ADJ)
Verbal adposition (ADP)
Determiner (DET)
Focus word (FOC)
Sentence type marker (STM)
Conjunction (CONJ)
Adverb (ADV)
Three of these categories are open, that is new members can freely be added:
noun, verb and adjective. Six others are closed in that they form systems that
cannot easily be extended: clitic pronoun, determiner, focus word, sentence type
marker and conjunction. The category of adverb is somewhat marginal, as we
shall see, and falls somewhere between an open and closed category.
Most of the categories have subcategories: nouns are divided into such
subclasses as common nouns, names, independent pronouns, etc.; verbs into54SOMALImain and auxiliary verbs, and so on. There are also two groups of rather
idiosyncratic elements which we will not list as major categories: ideophones,
discussed in 4.11, and the interjections, attention-gainers, etc. described in 4.12.
4.1NounsWe can identify four main types ofnoun: common nouns (CN), names or proper
nouns (NAM), independent pronouns (IPRO), and numerals (NUM). The defining
grammatical characteristics of nouns are that they are marked for case and that
they occur as subjects ofverbs, governing agreement features on the verb. They
may act as the heads of noun phrases, which share these characteristics, as
discussed in chapter 6. These main types or subcategories also have
characteristics which distinguish between them, as we shall see; for example, in
the modifiers that they allow. Common nouns and numerals, for example, occur
with determiners and restrictive relative clauses, while proper nouns and
independent pronouns normally do not. We begin our description with common
nouns.
4.1.1 Common nouns
Common nouns typically carry information from the grammatical systems of
gender, number and case, which are marked by the morphological processes of
accentual change, suffixation and reduplication.
4.1.1.1 Gender
There are two genders: all nouns are either masculine or feminine. For the most
part gender is not predictable from the meaning of nouns. The exceptions
include nouns for people and animals: nin 'man' is masculine and náag 'woman'
is feminine, for example. Even here though there are arbitrary cases: the
collective noun hawéen 'women' is masculine.
This arbitrariness ofgender is emphasised by the fact that Somali exhibits
the gender polarity found in other Cushitic languages. Many nouns reverse their
gender in the plural, as shown in the examples below, where the polarity extends
over different types ofplural formation by suffixes and accentual change:
(2) Masculine → Feminine
sánnad M 'year'

túke M 'crow'

'spears'Gender is reflected grammatically in three important forms of agreement:
agreement with the set of suffixed determiners, subject-verb agreement, and
agreement with clitic subject pronouns. We can show these first with singular
nouns.
The determiners, discussed in 4.6 below, include definite articles,
demonstratives, possessives, etc. and divide into two formal agreement classes:
a masculine class which has basic forms with initial k֊ and a feminine class with
initial t-. We saw in chapter 3 that these forms undergo complex rules ofsandhi
when attached to the noun but simple examples with the remote definite article
-kίil-tίi are:
(5) baabùurN M
náag N F'truck'
'woman'+kíi
+tíi→
→baabuurkii 'thetruck(remote)'
náagtíi
'thewoman(remote)'Subject - verb agreement is marked on the verb by a set ofagreement affixes. In
the majority class of suffix verbs these are attached after the stem composed of
the verb root and any derivational affixes, while in the minority class ofprefix or
strong verbs, they attach as prefixes to the root. For example in prefix verbs a
distinction is made between the affixes y- 3sGM and ŕ- 3SGF:
(6)Baabuurkii wu.u yimi.

woman:F-the DM+she 3SG F : came
'The woman came.'","[66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71]"
"We assume that the accentual patterns (APs) on the possessives in (125) are the
category's inherent APs. The absolutive and subject case markings are the phrasal
exponents of nominal case marking. We will assume that possessives, unlike nouns, do
not have as their default an absolutive case form because they are not nouns and
therefore do not have inherent case.",[285]
"However there is a construction in which a noun may occur within the verbal
group immediately preceding this adjective:
(60)Nín-ku
wuu
xòog
man-the DM+he strength
'The man is very strong.'badan-yahay.
much-isFor any noun N preceding the adjective badán the meaning is something like
'much in N'; thus we can find:
(61)Gabádh-dhu way
qurúx
girl-the
DM+she beauty
'The girl is very beautiful.'badan-tahay.
much-isThe problem here is how to treat combinations like xòog badán and qurúx
badán. The accentual patterns do not identify a single word, a compound
adjective like *xoogbadán 'great-in-strength' or quruxbadán 'great-in-beauty'.57
Accentually, the nouns remain independent, showing the same tonal pattern as
when, for example, heading a noun phrase, e.g. qurúx badán 'beauty which is
much, great beauty'. However the nouns xòog and qurúx in (60) and (61) are
occupying positions inside the verbal group not normally available to nominals
(see chapters 6 and 7). Thus it is not possible to analyse qurúx badán as a
nominal complement of the copula yahay in (61) (meaning something like 'She
is a great beauty'): such a complement cannot occur between the sentence type
marker waa and the verb. What we seem to have here is a process somewhere
between straightforward compounding and normal phrasal syntax, where this
adjective may incorporate nouns to form a phrase. Moreover the process is
fairly productive: any semantically plausible nominal may participate.58 It may
seem preferable on balance to view this as a syntactic rather than a lexical
process but the decision is not an easy one. With such difficulties in mind we
outline some of the major types of compounding.
Compounds can be classified in a number of ways, for example by the
category of the derived word, the relationship to syntactic phrases, whether theSOMALI156meaning of the compound is predictable from its parts, etc. In this section we
discuss compounds by their grammatical category.
5.4.1 Compound nouns
Compound nouns are very common and consist of a number of different types.
One class we could call lexicalised noun phrases. These have the form of
syntactically well-formed noun phrases, though of course their accentual pattern
identifies them as single words. These compounds are therefore head-initial and
may include various types of modifier elements, for example adjectives in (62);
nouns with genitive case endings in (63); and as described earlier, relative clause
constructions containing a head, a complement noun and the adjective Iéh
'possessing' in (64):

WORD DERIVATION157A second class of compound noun is composed of the sequence noun +
noun (N + N). These compounds are also head-initial and parallel independent
genitive constructions, though once again they are tonally marked as words, for
example:
(65)(a)(b)(c)(d)(lit. 'language-of-house')
Ν Μ 'dialect'
áf

from:There are few examples of N + N compounds where the head occurs
finally: one productive exception is provided by compounds with the noun
aqóon N F 'knowledge' as the second element, for example:
(66)beeraqóon
N F 'agronomy'
cayayaanaqóon N F 'entomology'
cìraqóon
NF 'meteorology'
nololaqóon
N F 'biology'cf. béer
NF 'farm'
cf. cayayàan N M 'insects'
cf. cír
N M 'sky, atmosphere'
cf. nolól
NF 'life'The third and perhaps the commonest class of compound nouns are
deverbal, or synthetic, compounds, where the final element is a verbal noun
derived from a verb root.
In these compounds the preceding noun is
semantically related to the verbal noun in the same way as it would be to a verb
in a corresponding clause. We can classify these compounds by the particular
role the first noun bears in relation to the verbal noun. We begin with probably
the commonest type: where the verbal noun is formed from a transitive verb
stem and the preceding noun functions semantically like its object. Here there
are two sub-types. The first, exemplified in (67) below, consists of compounds
where the verbal noun is derived by category shift of the root as described in
5.3.1 (sometimes called 'zero affixation' or 'conversion'), and the subject
argument is unspecified.","[170, 171, 172]"
"The second major feature ofthe Somali tone system is that its function is
to signal grammatical rather than lexical contrasts. In our noun examples so far
we have seen tone patterns marking distinctions of gender and number. In fact
tonal patterns in nouns are predictable from the noun's number, gender and
declension class. As we shall see in chapter 4, it is possible to establish
declensions of nouns, each with their characteristic tonal pattern, gender, and
way offorming plurals. Similarly individual verbal conjugations have associated
tonal patterns. Any apparently lexical contrasts, such as between the nouns inan
'boy' and inán 'girl' are by-products, so to speak, ofthe primary grammatical
distinction, in this instance of gender. Other functions of the tonal system
include case marking on nouns, as we shall see below.
A third feature of the tonal system is its independence from sentence
intonation. Because the tonal system employs pitch for essentially word level
grammatical information, it is not free to carry sentence level information such
as sentence type distinctions or information structure contrasts such as
emphasis, or focus. Thus questions, for example, are not distinguished from
statements by pitch tunes as in some other languages like English, but by the use
ofspecific morphemes, as shown in (30):
(30)(a)Máimáneyaa?
QM is:coming
'Is he coming?'
(b)
Wâa imáneyaa.
DM is:coming
'He is coming.'",[36]
"Other suffixes have no effect on the stem AP except to append their own
inherent accentual pattern to the new stem, for example the remote definite
article -kíil-tíi 'the' :
(64)gúri N M [AP2] 'house'
mìis N M [AP2] 'table'
arrín N F [AP1] 'affair'→
→
→gúrigíi
mìiskíi
arríntíi'thehouse(remote)'
'thetable(remote)'
'theaffair(remote)'SOMALI44naag NF[AP1] 'woman'→náagtíi'thewoman(remote)'Note that this suffix thus creates a noun phrase with two High tones.
Another important role ofAP changes is to mark case on nominals. These
accentual changes are also accompanied by suffixation in some noun declensions
but the marking is predominantly accentual. There is a basic unmarked case
which we term the absolutive (ABS); this is used with nominals in a range of
contexts: in isolation, as objects ofverbs and adpositions, when focused, etc.
The other cases are nominative, genitive and vocative, each of which can be
conveniently viewed as modifications to the basic absolutive form. In order to
describe case marking we need to add another accentual pattern:
(65) AP4: High tone on the first mora, Low elsewhere.
Once again word syllable structures will produce various realisations of this AP
and some neutralisations: for example, words with two short syllables will not
distinguish AP1 and AP4, and ofcourse short monosyllables may collapse AP1,
AP2 and AP4.
Although there are exceptions (4.1.1.4), the typical pattern of case
marking is for the inherent absolutive case AP of a noun to be changed in the
other cases as follows:
(66)Nominative (NOM)
AP3ABS→Genitive (GEN)
APIVocative (VOC)
AP4For example:
(67)ABS
Cali
Faadúmo
díbi
bisád
carrúur
(←*carruur)NOM
Cali
Faadumo
dibi
bisadi
carruuriGEN
Calí

bisád
carrúur
(←*carruur)VOC25
Cáli
NAM M 'Ali'
Fàadumo NAM F Fatima'
NM
'bull'
NF
'cat'
NF
'children'Accentual patterns are also sensitive to, and markers of, other kinds of syntactic
information. To take one example, verbs whose subjects are focused are marked
by a distinct pattern: they have a HIGH tone on their final mora. Compare for
example the forms of arkay 'saw' in the following:PHONOLOGICAL RULES45(68) (a) Axmed bàan arkay.
Axmed bàa+aan arkay
Ahmed FOC+I
saw
'IsawAXMED.'
(b) Áxmed bàa i arkay.
Áxmed bàa i arkáy
Ahmed FOC me saw
'AXMED saw me.'
3.4.3 Contextual effects
We claimed in 3.5.1 that the accentual pattern ofwords is predictable from their
grammatical status. This is largely true but there are a small number ofwords
belonging to functional categories whose accentual pattern is dependent upon
the surrounding context. The declarative sentence type marker waa and the
interrogative sentence type marker ma, for example, exhibit what we might call
a seesaw accentual pattern. If the following word contains a High tone mora,
they are Low tone; however if the following word is all Low tone then they
have High tone on their first mora, realised as waa and ma:
(69) (a) Waan diray.
Wàa+aan di.ray
DM+I
sent:lSG
T sent
it.'
(b) Waan dirayaa.
Waa+aan dirayaa
DM+I am : sending : 1SG
'I am sending it.'
(70) (a) Má dirtay?
má dirtay
QM sent:2SG
'Did you send it?'
(b) Ma diraysaa?
ma diraysaa
QM are:sending:2SG
'Are you sending iL?'
Interestingly however, ifa following High tone occurs before a pause and is thus
lowered to a phonetic Mid tone, then waa will have High tone. See for example
waa's sensitivity to the presence ofa pause after the following High tone:46SOMALI(71) (a) Wàa kán.
DM this:one
'It is this one'
(b)
Waa kán ee qaadó.
waa kán ee qaadó
DM this:one and take:IMP:SG
'It is this one, take it!'
This suggests that the accentual seesaw is sensitive to phonetic rather than
phonological tone.
Another example of contextual variation is exhibited by the verb phrase
conjunction 00 'and'. Before a following word this has High tone while before
a pause this becomes Falling tone:
(72) (a)
Wuu kacay 00 baxay.
wáa+uu kacay 00 baxay
DM+he rose and left
'He got up and left. '
(b)
Wuu kacay 00, baxay.
wáa+uu
kacay 00 baxay
DM+he rose and left
'He got up and, [pause] left. '
We may treat the accentual pattern on 00 in (72b) as a form of discourse
marker, where the speaker uses a marker of intended continuation to defend
against interruption. In other contexts, for example fast speech, 00 may be deaccented and cliticized onto a preceding element. This often occurs when 00
marks an appositive relative clause on an independent pronoun (8.2):
(73)iságoo
hurdá
he+and
sleeps
'he, who sleeps', 'while he is/was sleeping'In addition to these variable elements there are a range of contextual
accentual changes which remain to be investigated. For example, most plural
nouns, and the singular nouns in declension 8, have in their basic absolutive case
High tone on their final mora which lowers to a Low tone in certain contexts.
This rule, which we can call Accent Lowering, is also associated with a deletion
of stress. The contexts form a rather heterogeneous phonetic and syntactic
class: lowering does not take place when the noun is before a pause (including
isolation), when it is the head ofdependent elements like determiners, adjectivesPHONOLOGICAL RULES47or relative clauses, or when focused by the focus word ayàa. The lowering
does occur when the bare unfocused noun occurs before the verbal group, or as
noted by Banti (1988b), before the focus word baa and the clitic bá 'any':
(74) Non-lowering contexts
(a) nimán
'men'
(b) nimánka
'the men (non-remote)'
(c) nimánkíi
'the men (remote)'
(d) nimányaryár
'smallmen'
(e) Nimán ayàa yimíd
men
FOC came
'SOME MEN came.'
(75) Lowering contexts
(a) Niman bàa yimíd.
men
FOC came
'SOMEMENcame.'
(b) Nimanbá má arag.
niman-bá má arág
men-any not saw:NEG
'I didn't see any men.'
(c) Niman má aragtay?
men
QM saw:2SG
'Did you see some men?'
Banti (1988b), citing evidence for a similar lowering rule in nouns in another
Cushitic language Arbore, spoken in Ethiopia, suggests that this rule is a relic of
an earlier common Cushitic rule.
A further accentual rule, which we can term Accent Shift, affects singular
nouns ofdeclensions 6 and 7 and shifts their absolutive case pattern ofAP1 to
AP2 before a pause, for example:
(76) hooyó F 'mother' →
baré M 'teacher' →hóoyo
báreThis rule also affects some collective nouns, e.g. socotó F 'travellers' → socóto.
Since isolation is a subset ofthe pre-pause position, these AP2 forms will occur
as elicited forms.
In our present state of knowledge rules like Accent Lowering and Accent
Shift can be described but not given any more general explanation. As we have
said, the full range of processes that alter accentual patterns in various
phonological and grammatical contexts remains to be investigated.","[58, 59, 60, 61, 62]"
"SIMPLE SENTENCES185The verb form in a declarative shows distinctions of tense (past, present, fixture)
and of aspect (simple, progressive, habitual). The main modal use of declaratives
is to describe actual states of affairs. The future tense is used to express a
judgement that an event is certain to occur. This sentence type may also be
used to express ability and permission by using the auxiliary verb kár 'can, be
able', for example:
(3)Wàad
і
sóori
DM+you me feed:INF
'You can feed me.'kartaa.
can:PRES:2 SGTypically, declaratives with waa are used when all the nominal referents are
known and may be omitted. Noun phrases, when used, act like adjuncts or
topics and may occur before or after the verbal group, for example:
(4)
(5)waanadii
waan 
qaatay.
advice-the
DM+I you+from took
Ί took the advice from you'
[SHN 124. 22-3]
waannu
is
mehersannay
aniyo isagu.
DM+we:EXCL
RE
married
I-and
him
'We married each other I and him'
[SIIN 126. 23]The position and order of these NPs is free and does not reflect their
grammatical functions, unlike clitic pronouns within the verbal group which, as
we saw in chapter 6, have a subject-object-verb (s-o-v) order. Wherever they
occur such NPs are case marked; thus the NP aniyo isagu ' I and him' is subject
marked, carrying the nominative case form of the definite article -gu on the final
syllable.
Since waa declarative sentences are typically used when all the referents
are known, they are common in casual conversation but much less common in
narratives or the written prose of newspaper reports, letters, etc., where new
information is more frequent and thus focus is used.
Negative declaratives without focus are distinguished by two
characteristics: the sentence type marker waa is replaced by the negative word
má\: and the verb occurs in a special negative form. As described in 4.3, each
verbal paradigm displaying a tense and aspectual distinction has both positive
and negative forms. The negative past paradigms (past simple, past progressive
and past habitual) are characterised by invariable forms which do not show
person agreement. As mentioned in chapter 6, the negative word má 'not'
occurs within the verbal group and often occurs without subject clitic pronouns,
for example:SOMALI186(6)(a)
(b)Qálabkíi
má
jebín.
machine-the not
break:CAUS:PAST:NEG
'I/you/he/she etc. did not break the machine.'
Kumá
arkin.
you-notsaw:PAST SIMPLE:NEG'I/he/she/etc. did not see you.'
This suggests that negative declaratives are more context-dependent than
corresponding positive declaratives. It is possible however to use subject clitic
pronouns in negatives, where they follow má 'not':
(7)(a)(b)Ku má
uu
garánéyn.

'He did not understand you.'

"The possessive determiners occur without the article ka/ta to mark a semantic
distinction similar to the distinction between alienable and inalienable possession
found in many languages: possessives without suffixed articles are used with
nouns for family members, parts of the body, and by extension for close friends:

'your mother
'her leg'SOMALI116saaxìibkìin'your (PL) friend'When possessives occur in this way without a following second determiner, they
are noun phrase final elements and must carry case marking, exhibited by
accentual changes.
The accentual patterns on the pre-article possessive
determiners in (125) above on the other hand show no case marking 38 . When
possessives are noun phrase final, they show a distinction between absolutive
and nominative case as follows (shown on aabbé N M 'father'):

numerals. In this function the possessives are used in their inalienable form.

"173PHRASESComparing the position of uu in (35)-(36) and (38), we can see that subject
clitic pronouns occur in different positions in negative and positive sentences.
Note that this does not happen with the non-specific subject pronoun la which
remains in the position given in (1) earlier in both positive and negative
sentences, for example (where lóo ← la 'one' + ú 'in'):
(39)Muuska
sidáas
lóo
má
banana-the way-that one+in NEG
'One doesn't eat banana like that.'cunó.
eats:NEGSimilarly, in subordinate clauses subject clitic pronouns follow the
complementiser, for example in 'that', or the head NP of a relative clause, which
as described in 8.4.1, immediately precedes the clause, for example:
(40)Wuu
dóonayaa in
ay
sóo
iibsató.
DM-he wants
that she VEN buys
'He wants her to buy it.' (lit. 'He wants that she buys it.')This behaviour means that in subordinate clauses the subject pronouns may be
separated from the VGP by NPs, for example:
(41)Afádii wáxay kú tashatay ín ay gabdháha iyo adóogóod
wife-the what-she on decided that she girls-the
and father-their
isku dirtó όο uu gúriga

RE-on turn
and he house-the from throw: out them
'The wife decided that she would turn the girls and their father against each
other so that he would throw them out of the house'In the subordinate clauses in (41) the subject pronouns ay 'she' and uu 'he'
(shown in bold) are both separated from their VGPs by full NPs.
To summarise, subject clitic pronouns occupy different positions in
negative and subordinate clauses. This variability of position within, and
potential detachment from, the VGP differentiates subject clitic pronouns from
other elements in the VGP and may justify excluding them from the VGP template
in (1) earlier.
6.2Noun phraseNoun phrases in Somali are head-initial: the noun is followed by various
dependent elements. Some, like determiners, attach to the noun as clitics whileSOMALI174others, like modifying clauses and adjectives, follow the noun as
morphologically independent items. In addition noun phrases may be conjoined
by iyo 'and', described in 4.9, to form larger noun phrases with several equal
heads, e.g.:
(42)(a)
(b)
(c)Xásan iyo Cáli
'Hasan and Ali'
hílib iyo barìis
'meat and rice'
hilib, barìis iyo caanó
'meat, rice and milk'In this section we concentrate on the dependent elements which may occur with
head nouns.
6.2.1 Nouns modified by determiners
Each of the determiners described in 4.6 may modify nouns and occur as
suffixed clitics, for example with gèed Ν Μ 'tree' and mindi N F 'knife':

article: nouns for family members, body parts and by extension, close friendsPHRASES175occur without this final article, e.g. aabbáháy 'my father'. When combinations
of determiners on a noun occur they are always in the following order:
(47)
Noun+possessive+6.2.2 Nouns modified by nominals: possessive noun phrases
Noun phrases expressing possession occur in two types: the first, as we saw in
the last section, involves the use of a special possessive determiner on the
possessed noun. The order of nominals is possessor - possessed:
(46)Cáli
gúrigìisa
Ali:ABS
house-his-the:ABS
'Ali's house' (lit. '1і his house')Note that in the unmarked case both nominals occur in absolutive case. The
second type of possessive noun phrase shows the order possessed - possessor,
for example:
(49) gúriga Calí
house-the:ABS Ali:GEN
'Ali's house' (lit. 'the house of Ali')
Here in the unmarked case the possessed nominal occurs in the absolutive case
while the possessor occurs in the genitive. In typical expressions of possession
either construction is possible: we assume that the choice is influenced by the
information structure requirements of the discourse context, for example what
the current topic is, or which elements the speaker wishes to foreground.
Each possessive construction also occurs in extended uses where they
are not interchangeable. For example, as mentioned in 4.1.2, the genitive
construction is used in genealogies and by extension in the form of proper
names:
(50) Xásan Calí
Hasan:ABS Ali:GEN
'Hasan child of Ali' (lit. 'Hasan of Ali')
The possessive determiner construction is not used in this way in names.","[187, 188, 189, 190]"
"We can briefly discuss each of these characteristics. Firstly, the range of
sentence types found in main clauses (interrogative, imperative, optative, etc.)
does not occur in subordinate clauses. The latter have a single type that most
closely resembles declarative main clauses, except that the declarative marker
waa does not occur. Indeed sentence type markers (STMs) do not occur at all in
subordinate clauses. Thus, as we saw in the last chapter, there are no
subordinate interrogative clauses, or 'indirect questions', in Somali. The
function of these is performed by relative clauses on non-interrogative nouns of
time, place, manner, etc., for example:
(2)(3)Weydii
hálkuu
tégayó!
ask:IMP
place-the+he is:going
'Ask him where he is going!' (lit. 'Ask him the place to which he is going')
Má
garáneyó
inta
nín
hálkáa
kú dhimatáy.
not know:NEG amount-the man place-that in died
' I don't know how many men died there.'
(lit. ' I don't know the amount of men that died in that place')Secondly, as described in chapter 7, the focus markers bàa, ayàa and
wáxa(ä) do not occur within subordinate clauses, though the whole clause maySOMALI210be focused. Hence, for example, no NP within a subordinate clause may be
focused.
Thirdly, as we saw in chapter 4, subordinate clause verbs are distinguished
from main clause equivalents by a combination of accentual pattern and
inflection. This is further emphasised when subordinate clauses are case marked
for their grammatical fonction within the larger sentence.87 In addition to these
main features other differences occur: for example the negative word má 'not'
does not occur in subordinate clauses, always being replaced by aan 'not'.
Also, as we shall see, clauses acting as complements of certain verbs, like dòon
'wish, want', have a restricted range of tense and aspectual differences.
One striking feature of the system of subordinate clauses is the important
role of relative clauses. Indeed it is possible to see all subordination as relative
clause formation, though in some cases the head elements have been
delexicalized and are no longer foll nouns. In most cases though their historical
relationship to nominals is clear. Because of this we begin with relative clauses
proper in 8.1 and 8.2 before moving on to other kinds of subordinate clauses.
8.1Restrictive relative clauses8.1.1 Basic features
Restrictive relative clauses are used to help identification of the head noun from
a larger set.88 In the terminology of Keenan (1985), Somali restrictive relative
clauses are post-nominal external relatives with the relativised position in the
clause marked by a gap. See for example sentence (4a) below, which contains
the head nominal and modifying relative clause (4b):
(4)(a)
(b)Nínka
taló
xún taliyaa dhaxálkèeda ayùu
helaa.
man-the advice bad advises legacy-its
FOC+he finds
'The man who gives bad advice receives its legacy.' (Proverb)
ninka
taló
xún taliyaa
man-the advice bad advises
'the man who gives bad advice'In (4b) the head noun is nín 'man' which attracts the determiner -ka 'the' and
occurs before the relative clause. There is no relative pronoun in the clause.
The head nominal always precedes the clause whatever position in the clause is
relativised.
The relative clause resembles a main clause in syntax except that the
tendency for verb final order is much stronger. In addition certain elements such211SUBORDINATE CLAUSESas subject clitic pronouns, like uu 'he, i t ' in (5) below, and the negative w o r d
aan ' n o t ' in (6) are attracted t o the head nominal and thus move away f r o m the
verbal group, for example:
(5)(6)meeshuu
awal sadcaalka
ka
bilaabay
place+the+it first journey-the from began
'the place from which the journey first began'
[BCH
nímáan
waxbá
oqóon
man+not
anything
know:NEG
'a man who doesn't know anything'9.38]Where the head NP ends in a v o w e l these elements may coalesce onto the head
in the same way as w i t h the focus w o r d báa, described in 3.1.2, f o r example:
(7)Wáxaanád
ahayni

not
catch :NEG
'The thing you are not does not catch you,' 'False rumour cannot harm you.'
(Proverb)
(where wáxaanád
→*wáx+a+aan+aad)
A n y argument position may be relativised, as in the f o l l o w i n g examples(where the head and relative clause are underlined where necessary): subject i n
(8), direct object in (9), and oblique arguments in (10) and (11):

M u l t i p l e restrictive relative clauses are j o i n e d by the conjunctions oo ' a n d 'i f the head nominal is indefinite and ' a n d 'i f the head nominal is definite, f o r
example:SOMALI212(12)(13)niman uu

I f the head nominal is complex, for example consisting o f a genitive orpossessive construction, or a numeral f o l l o w e d by a dependent noun (6.2.2),
relative clauses must be introduced by a conjunction: 8 9

'the first six verses of the poem' (lit. 'the six of verse which first start the

Consequently, given the phrase final nature o f case marking, the head nominal
never receives main clause case marking and always occurs in the default
absolutive case. The relative clause verb, as the final element o f the phrase,
carries the formal case marking. For example in (16a) b e l o w the head nominal
ninkíi 'the man' is object o f the adposition lá ' w i t h ' and the accentual marking
o f absolutive case applies t o the relative clause verb raacèen.","[224, 225, 226, 227]"

ungrammatical; or reconstructed form
semantically anomalous
contextually inappropriateGlosses: Because of the morphological complexity of Somali and the frequency of
coalescence rules, it is often difficult to segment the surface forms into their constituent
morphemes. For clarity, in chapters 2-4 each example is accompanied by a morpheme
by morpheme breakdown which makes the underlying morphological structure
transparent. A gloss and translation accompany this. A simple example is:
Wày iigá yeeshay
waa+ay
i+ú+ká
yeel+t-ay
DM+she me+for+from
accept+3SGF-PAST
'She accepted it from me for him.'
The following symbols are used: the hyphen - marks surface morpheme boundaries, e.g.
nin-ka 'man-the'; the colon : marks unsegmentable grammatical features, e.g. súg
wait:IMP:SG, or when one word in Somali corresponds to several in the gloss, e.g.
xanàaq 'grow:furious'; the plus sign + marks the underlying morphological structure
before rules of cliticisation and coalescence apply, as in the above example.
The glosses are designed to aid the reader and thus clarity has been a greater priority
than exhaustiveness or consistency. Thus translations are often used in place of list of
features, so that ahay is glossed as 'am' rather 'be:PRES: ISG'. Similarly, when the
context makes it obvious, information is omitted, so when its subject is overtly a
masculine singular noun, a verb like tegay will simply be glossed as 'went'. From
chapter 5 onwards, the morpheme by morpheme breakdown is omitted for reasons of
space. Since the main coalescence and sandhi rules have been described by then, it is
hoped that readers will be able to 'read' the morphological structure more easily for
themselves.
Data sources: The sources of examples taken from publications are cited in the text in
square brackets containing the initials of the publication (listed in Appendix I), followed
by page and line numbers, for example [SHS 25.17-19], meaning lines 17-19 on page 25
of Sheekoxariirooyin Soomaaliyeed, Folktales from Somalia.","[12, 13, 14, 15]"
"Perhaps a better English gloss for this particular usage would be 'case' or 'instance'.
Compare the related use of the word in the expression haddíi kalé 'otherwise' (lit. 'the
other case').",[291]

noun phrase; in (91) the relative clause head is subject of its main sentence and
kéenayaa is marked for nominative case. This example enables us to see the
syntactic information carried by the inflectional system in verbs. The present
progressive form kéenayä in (90) signals three independent pieces of syntactic
information: (a) that the verb is in a subordinate clause; (b) that its subject is a
gap coreferential with the relative clause head; and (c) that this head nominal is
not subject of the main clause.34
4.3.5 Prefix Verb Paradigms
As mentioned earlier, in Standard Somali there are four prefix or 'strong' verbs:
yidhi 'say', yimi 'come', yiil 'be (in a place)' and yiqiin 'know', giving them in
their reference forms of 3.SG.M past simple. We mentioned too that under
pressure from the suffix verbs, there is considerable regional variation in the
forms of these verbs. The following are the forms commonly used in northern
varieties of the language, with some common variations shown by the use of
parentheses. We list the verbal paradigms in the same order as for suffix verbs,
abbreviating the description somewhat to avoid repetition. Note that unlike
suffix verbs these verbs distinguish between 1SG and 3SGM in simple forms.
4.3.5. J Imperative
The main forms are as follows:SG
PLyidhi
dhé(h)
dháhayimi
Malay
kaalayayiil
dol
óollayiqiin
oqòow
oqåada (oqóodd)(aqóodd)The imperative forms of these verbs are irregular in a number of ways. Firstly
we might note that the positive imperative forms of yimi 'come' are suppletive,
not reflecting the root shape. Secondly the forms given for yiil and yiqiin are
not commonly used since these are stative verbs. They are usually replaced by
dynamic verbs, for example, for 'Know it!' speakers commonly use the suffix
verb forms ogòwì (SG) and ogäada (PL) derived from the adjective óg 'aware,
cognisant'. The negative imperatives, used with the sentence type marker ha,
are:SG

"The specific type of third person has to be recovered from context. Note that
for economy we have not given an English gloss for all the third person options
in each example in this book, simply giving whichever pronoun seems likeliest in
context, or in some cases writing 'him etc.', 'her etc.' and so on. One effect of
this use of a gap is that the argument structure of a verb is always filled: it is not
possible in Somali to remove an argument from a verb simply by omitting it as in
the English pair He ate lunch/He ate. In Somali omitting an overt NP will
trigger a third person object pronoun interpretation as in (54a); to express theSOMALI74English He ate, Somalis must use an indefinite object wáx N M 'thing,
something' as in (54b):
(54)(a)(b)Wùu cunay.

kunAgain, these pronouns also have a gap for third person. The second series
pronouns are used when two overt object clitic pronouns occur in the same
verbal group. This most commonly occurs when one is the object of a verb and
the other the object of an adposition.28 Thus, i f only one object pronoun occurs
it will be a primary series form, whether governed by a verb or adposition:

object of the adposition ka 'from'. Note that in (57) the object of qàad 'take' is
marked by a gap.
The second series forms only occur when two overt pronouns are
required, that is when two non-third person object pronouns occur in the sameGRAMMATICAL CATEGORIES75verbal group. This limits their occurrence somewhat in conversation. An
example is:

4.1.1.2 Number
As with other Cushitic languages, the number system in Somali nouns is quite
complicated. Firstly there are a number of categories of number and secondly
the morphological marking of plural, where applicable, has a number of
exponents. We can begin by dividing common nouns into four number types:
countable, mass, collective and transnumeral.
Countable nouns form the majority. When used unmodified they refer to
an individual entity, for example: kòob 'a cup', maalin 'a day'. They can be
counted directly by being used after a numeral, for example labá kóob 'two
cups', áfar maalmóod 'four days'. As described in 4.1.4., these are genitive
constructions where the numeral is the head and the counted noun occurs in the
genitive case, in some instances in the singular and in others in the plural, as weGRAMMATICAL CATEGORIES57shall see. Countable nouns otherwise regularly occur in plural forms, e.g.
koobáb 'cups', maalmó 'days'.
Mass nouns form a smaller group which do not refer to individuals but
name a substance or material, for example: biyó 'water', búr 'flour', caanó
'milk', saliid 'oil', shàah 'tea', sonkor 'sugar', súbag 'clarified butter', timó
'hair'. These nouns can only be counted indirectly by using a relevant unit of
measurement, for example:
(10) labá kóob 00 shàah áh
labá
kóob
00
shàah
áh
two-ABS
cup:GEN and
tea:ABS
be
'Two cups oftea' (lit. 'Two ofcup and which are tea')
Mass nouns do not normally display a singular/plural distinction but the class is
divided into nouns which always occur with singular verbal agreement and those
with plural verbal agreement; for example, the two masculine nouns shàah 'tea'
and caanó 'milk', respectively:
(11) Mass noun, singular agreement
Shàahii wùu qubtay.
shàah-kii
wàa+uu
tea-the
DM+CPRO:3SGM
'Thetea spilled.'
(12) Mass noun, plural agreement
Caanihii way qubteen.
caanó-kiì
wàa+ay
milk-tl1e
DM+CPRO:3PL
The milk spilled/qubtay
spilled:3SG Mqubteen
spilled:3PLSince the mass nouns which take plural agreement all end in final -ό (caanó,
biyó, etc.), and since this is, as we shall see, a common plural suffix, we can
suggest a possible explanation for this agreement pattern. These represent
plural forms historically which no longer have a singular form, i.e. what are
sometimes called plurale tantum forms.
Collective nouns are another restricted group of nouns, which are used to
refer to sets ofindividuals. They can identify either the usually experienced set,
for example gèel 'herd ofcamels' or the universal set, e.g. rag 'men, mankind'.
Ifthe context allows either interpretation is possible, so that gèel can mean ' a
herd ofcamels' or be used generically for 'camels'. Other examples include:
adhi '(herd of) goats and sheep, carrúur 'children', dad 'people', dúmar
'women, womankind', habló 'girls', idó '(flock of) sheep', ilmo 'children', / o '58SOMALI'cattle', xοοlό 'livestock'. As with mass nouns, collectives cannot be counted
directly, but can be counted indirectly using a relative clause on a head numeral,
for example:
(13)Saddex carriiur
ah
three
children:ABS are
'three children' (lit.: 'three who are children')Collectives do not normally show a singular/plural distinction but as with mass
nouns, forms ending in -ό always take plural agreement:
(14)Collective noun, plural agreement
Hablihii wàyyimaadeen.
hablo-kii
wàa+ay
yìmaadeen
girls-the
DM+CPRO:3PL came:3PL
'The girls came'Speakers do sometimes pluralize collectives when the set referred to is smaller
than the universal set. Thus for example, one can hear geelal 'herds of camels'
fromgèel '(herd of) camels'.
Transnumeral nouns, to use the term introduced by Serzisko (1992), are a
small group of nouns which can be used with the semantic force of any of the
categories described so far. Thus kalliiun 'fish' can be used to refer to an
individual fish, or the substance, or a collective, so that the nominal kalluunkan
{<r-halluun - kán 'this') can be used for 'this (one) fish', 'this fish meat', or 'this
group of fish'. Other examples include: heed 'egg', cambe 'mango', liin
'orange, lemon', muus 'banana', sigaar 'cigarette(s)', ukiin 'egg'.
Transnumeral nouns cannot be counted directly by numerals; they require the
use ofa relative clause with as its head a numeral or a unit ofmeasure:
(15)(16)xabbad liin
ah
unit
orange be
'one orange' (lit.: 'a unit that is orange')
laba
liin
ah
two
orange be
'two oranges' (lit.: 'two which are orange(s)')As we have noted, of these types of common noun, only countable nouns
regularly form plurals. Plurals are formed by a range of morphological
operations which we describe in the next section when we discuss declensions of59GRAMMATICAL CATEGORIEScountable nouns. We postpone discussion ofcase to section 4.1.1.4, since the
noun declensions are helpful in discussing case marking.
4.1. L 3 Noun declensions
There have been a number of declension systems proposed for Somali nouns.
Some approaches, as in Hyman (1981) and Banti (1988b), are predominantly
phonological in orientation and classify nouns according to accentual patterns.
Others, like Andrzejewski (1964, 1979), Caney (1984) and Saeed (1993a), have
established declensions on combinations of phonological and grammatical
Of>criteria. Here we follow Saeed (1993a) with one or two modifications. This
system classifies countable nouns according to their gender, how they form
plurals and their resulting accentual patterns. In this discussion and our account
of case in the next section, we will make use of the major accentual patterns
introduced in chapter 3 :
( 17)AP1 : HIGH tone on the last mora, LOW elsewhere;
AP2: HIGH tone on the penultimate mora, LOW elsewhere;
AP3: LOW tones on all moras;
AP4: HIGH on the first mora, LOW elsewhere.","[71, 72, 73, 74]"
"After years of heated debate about choosing between Roman, Arabic and
indigenous orthographies, a Roman orthography was adopted for Somali in the
Somali Republic in 1972 and Somali was adopted as the official language ofthe4SOMALIstate. Great strides were made in the development of literacy and the
introduction of Somali as the medium of government, education and mass
media. Arabic was adopted as the second language ofthe state. At this level of
official state languages, Somali thus joined its neighbours Amharic in Ethiopia
and Swahili in Kenya, making this region one of the most important in the
development of African languages as official media. Though the development
of Somali as an official language has been halted by the recent civil wars, it
continues to be the written medium in all parts ofthe Somali-speaking Horn and
among and between expatriate communities abroad. Andrzejewski (1974,
1978) and Laitin (1977) give descriptions ofthe Somali experience oflanguage
planning.
Somali shows considerable dialect variation. There are three main dialect
groups, Northern, Benadir and May. The Northern dialect group is the most
geographically widespread of these; indeed this is a somewhat misleading term
since, because of clan migrations, this dialect group is spoken in a broad sweep
across the northern, western and southernmost parts of the Somali-speaking
area. This dialect seems to have been used as a lingua franca amongst other
dialects. It enjoys the most prestige, not least because it has been the dialect
used by the greatest Somali poets and by the various political élites since the
formation ofthe Somali state. Not surprising then this dialect formed the basis
of the standard used for official purposes in the Somali Republic. Because of
this some writers have called this dialect Common Somali. It is this dialect that
forms the subject ofthis book, though we will use the term StandardSomali.4 A
second large group is formed by the Benadir (Benaadir) dialects spoken along
and behind the central Indian Ocean coast, including Mogadishu. There is a fair
degree of inter-comprehensibility between Benadir dialects and Standard
Somali. The third major dialect group consists of the May (Maay) dialects
spoken in a broad band of southern Somalia stretching from almost the
Ethiopian border to just short of the coastal strip between Mogadishu and
Kismayo. The largest urban centre in this dialect area is Baydhaba (Baidoa).
The May dialect group shows considerable differences from Standard and
Benadir dialects at all levels and these latter two groups and May are mutually
incomprehensible. Because of the role and status given to Standard Somali
many May speakers are able to use it as a lingua franca. There has been little
use of May dialects in education, official media, or publishing. In addition to
these main groups there are a number of smaller, more localised dialects in the
southern inter-riverine region and in the southern coastal towns. These include
the Jiddu (Jiiddu) dialect (Moreno 1951); the Tunni dialect spoken in the coastal
region around Brava (Tosco 1997); the Karre dialect of Qoryooley (Tosco
1989); and the Ashrafdialects ofMogadishu and Merka (Moreno 1953).5DISCOURSE5The overall picture of the dialects contrasts the relative homogeneity of
Standard Somali over its vast range with the much greater dialectal variation in
the more sedentary areas of the southern riverine regions and around the
southern ports ofMogadishu, Merka, Brava and Kismayo.61.3Linguistic studiesAlthough Somali is possibly the best documented and most studied Cushitic
language, in many areas the linguistic description is still very sketchy. Perhaps
the most developed area is lexicology. Here there exists a major Somali-Italian
dictionary ofmore than forty thousand entries (Agostini et al. eds. 1985), with a
related thirty-five thousand-entry Italian-Somali dictionary (Puglielli ed. 1998).
There is also a twenty-six thousand-entry Somali-English dictionary (Zorc and
Osman eds. 1993), a substantial Somali-French-Somali dictionary (Maxamed
1986) and a monolingual Somali dictionary (Keenadiid 1976). In the area of
grammar, there are relatively recent concise reference grammars in English
(Saeed 1993a), and in German (Lamberti 1988), as well as older studies in
Italian (Moreno 1955, Panza 1974), and Russian (Zholkovskij 1971). A series of
grammatical studies, Studi Somali, has been published by the Italian
Government's Dipartimento per la cooperazione allo svilippo (see for example
Cardona and Agostini ed. 1981, Puglielli ed. 1981, Puglielli ed. 1984). Teaching
handbooks have been published in English (Zorc and Issa 1990, Orwin 1995),
German (El-Solami-Mewis 1987) and French (Abdullahi 1996). Perhaps the
weakest areas are in phonetics and phonology where there is still no book-length
study published 7, and perhaps less surprisingly, in pragmatics and discourse,
though Biber (1995) includes Somali in a study ofregister variation.
If we move from books to academic articles and papers there has been a
steady increase in the number of linguistic studies published. There is notably a
three-yearly congress held by the Somali Studies International Association
whose Proceedings (e.g. Labahn ed. 1984) contain many linguistic papers.
Finally any survey, however brief, must acknowledge the groundbreaking series
of Somali grammatical studies published by the late B.W. Andrzejewski; for a
bibliography see Hayward and Lewis (eds. 1996).
1.4Design ofthis bookThe book has nine chapters with an appendix of selected texts. Chapters 2 and 3
deal with the sounds ofSomali: Chapter 2 outlines the phonological units ofthe6SOMALIlanguage, and Chapter 3 describes some of the most important phonological
rules. Chapter 4 sets out the basic word classes, or grammatical categories, of
the language, while Chapter 5 describes the derivational processes which
operate to extend the categories ofverb, noun, and adjective. This chapter also
discusses compounding. The next three chapters deal with syntax. Chapter 6 is
principally concerned with the internal structure of noun phrases and the verbal
group. Chapter 7 describes the structure ofsimple sentences and establishes the
major sentence types. Chapter 8 goes on to deal with subordinate clauses,
highlighting the central role of relative clauses. Finally, Chapter 9 is concerned
with those discourse processes that most fundamentally affect grammatical
structure, in particular the roles of focus and topic. Appendix II contains a brief
selection of extracts from various types of Somali texts, including both prose
and poetry, with morpheme by morpheme glosses and translations.
The Somali examples in this book are taken from a combination of
sources. One of my main preoccupations in writing this study has been to use
language material that is as authentic as possible. Many of the examples were
recorded from native speakers over several years of fieldwork in Somalia and
Kenya, and from Somali speakers visiting and resident in the UK and Ireland.
Other examples are taken from a variety of published materials: textbooks and
other books published by the government ofthe Somali Republic, newspapers,
collections ofpoems and tales, etc. The principal published sources are listed in
Appendix I. As described in chapter 2, tonal accent plays an important role in
marking grammatical distinctions in Somali. Since it only makes a restricted
number of lexical distinctions, tonal accent is not marked in the official
orthography. In examples that were recorded from speech by the author, tonal
accent is always marked; in extracts from published sources it is not marked.","[18, 19, 20, 21]"
"SOMALI240(b) Waa kúmal
'Who is it?'
(c) Waa xaggée?
'Where is it/are they?'
Discussing these and similar problems I argued in Saeed (1984) that there is no
overt verb focus word in Somali and that waa should be viewed, like the
question word ma, as merely consistent with verb focus. In this approach waa,
like the question word ma, and the optative word há, is analysed as a sentence
type marker (STM), in this case identifying positive declarative sentences. This
has the advantage that it explains why waa is replaced by other markers in other
sentence types, and by the negative word ma in negative declaratives.104
Of course in this approach we must explain why waa does not occur with
bàalayàa and waxa{a) in positive declaratives with focus. We might take note
here of Ajello's (1995) observation that focus can be viewed as part of the
modality system in Somali. He suggests that nominal focus asserts the existence
of the referent: ""In altre parole, anche quando la focalizzazione verte su un
sintagma nominale, essa rappresenta l'asserzione che un tale sintagma nominale
non è virtuale, ipotetico, ma reale e che esso ha un certo ruolo all'interno della
predicazione principale."" (Ajello 1995: 16). Waa sentences on the other hand
involve the assertion of the whole predication. This identification of a functional
contrast may help explain the complementary distribution of the
constructions.105
9.1.4 Word order and topics
As we have seen, the description of word order, or more properly constituent
order, has to make reference to both syntactic status and information structure.
Inside phrases the order of elements is generally fixed, and the constituents of
verbal groups (6.1) and noun phrases (6.2) can be described by templates. The
relative order of noun phrases and verbal groups, however, is dependent on
information structure. It is possible to discern an underlying preference for the
verb final clause structure described for other Cushitic languages. One piece of
evidence is the rigid order of subject-object-verb we find in clitic pronouns in
the VGP (6.1.1). Another is the fact that the basic focus strategy, bàalayàa
focus, requires focused elements to occur before the verb. Speakers must use a
wáxa(a) cleft to position focused elements after the verb. This is related to a
further significant feature: the tendency for post-verbal NPs to be known and
activated. Indeed it is reasonable to view post-verbal NPs, other than in clefts,
as afterthought topics. As Gebert (1986) points out, in an all-new context
provided by a question like (39a) below, reply (39c) is inappropriate:DISCOURSE(39)(a)(b)(c)241Maxàa
dhacáy?
what+FOC happened
'What happened?'
Càli bàa Maryám diláy.
Ali
FOC Mariam hit
'ALI hit Mariam'
#Cáli
bàa diláy Maryám.
Ali FOC hit
Mariam
'ALI hit Mariam'The nominal Maryam can appropriately be new in (39b) but not in (39c).
This observation needs qualification, however, since there are a number of
cases where this tendency does not hold. Adverbial expressions for example can
occur post-verbally even when new. Gebert (1986) provides the following
examples:
(40)(a)
(b)(c)Maxaa dhacay?
'What happened?'
#Cali baa dilay Maryam.
Ali
FOC hit
Maryam
'ALI hit Maryam.'
Cali baa dhintay shaley.
Ali FOC died
yesterday
'ALI died yesterday. 'Here the adverbial shaley 'yesterday' but not the object Maryam is appropriate
as new information in post-verbal position. Similarly, locative NPs governed by
verbal adpositions may occur post-verbally when new; to use Gebert's examples
again:
(41)(a)(b)(c)Wax cusubi ma jiraan?
thing new
QM are
'What's the news?'
#Cali
baa tegay Marka.
Ali
FOC went-to Marka
'ALI has gone to Marka. '
Cali baa ku dhintay Marka.
Ali
FOC in died
Marka
'ALI has died in Marka. '242SOMALIRepresenting new information in (41), the town name Marka is appropriate
post-verbally when governed by the adposition kú 'in' but not when it is an
argument of the verb tág 'go to'.
Interestingly this seems to be more dependent upon the function role of
the governed nominal than the simple syntactic fact of government by an
adposition, since in the following exchange (42c) is less appropriate than (42b):
(42)(a)(b)(c)Wáx cusubi má jiraan?
thing new
QM are
'What's the news?'

"3.4.1 Basic assignmentoftonalaccentIn this approach accentual patterns are assigned to words on the basis of their
grammatical status. Thereafter rules of morphology and syntax alter the basic
patterns. This means that the details ofindividual APs and changes on them are
best described in the relevant grammatical sections of this book. We can
however provide a few examples.
Thus for example the feminine nouns of declension 1 have AP1 in the
singular: for example, warqád 'letter', and by the rule in (58c) above, cayáar
'game'. The masculine nouns ofdeclension 2 on the other hand have AP2 in the
singular: for example, síxir 'magic, sorcery', by rule (58b) above, qiràal
'confession'; and by rule (58c) above, múudal 'miser'. It is clear that it is the
grammatical distinction between these declensions that is responsible for the
different accentual patterns. Some roots, for example, may enter either
declension: for example the unaccented underlying form *wiyil 'rhinoceros' may
surface either as a declension 1 noun wiyíl 'female rhinoceros' or a declension 2
noun wiyil 'male rhinoceros'. Similar pairs are quite common and include: inán
'girl', ínan 'boy; ma1ían 'female twin', matàan 'male twin'; daméer 'female
donkey', damèer 'male donkey'.
In the verbal system individual paradigms are distinguished by a
combination of inflection and accentual pattern. The accentual pattern alone
does not normally distinguish forms but there are some minimal pairs, for
example kéen (past independent 3.M.SG) 'He brought (it).'and kèen (imperative
SG) 'Bring (it)!'. Other grammatical categories have their associated accentual
patterns.
To use examples we have already seen: adpositions have a
characteristic pattern of AP1, while verbal pronouns have the pattern AP3.
There are some minimal pairs distinguished by this, for example the object
pronoun ku 'you' and the adposition kú 'in, into', the impersonal subject43PHONOLOGICAL RULESpronoun la 'one, someone' and the adposition lá 'with'. Given the overall
pattern of the Somali accentual system, it seems preferable to identify the
accentual pattern of these forms with their grammatical category rather than as
lexical information. This is supported by the fact that there seem to be no cases
where words with the same grammatical features are distinguished by accentual
pattern. We give the accentual patterns of individual grammatical categories as
they are introduced, for example in chapters 4 and 5.
3.4.2 Accentual patterns and grammatical rules
As will become clear, many grammatical processes influence the basic accentual
patterns of word roots. Rules of morphological derivation, for example, often
have a tonal as well as segmental element and will produce a single output AP
from various input APs. See for example the two following rules of nominal
derivation which produce negative antonyms and abstract nouns, respectively,
and which both have as their output feminine nouns with AP2:
(61)ayàanNM [AP2] 'luck'(62)carrúur NF
childhood'[AP2]'child'→→ayaandárro NF 'badluck'
díin NF [AP1] 'religion' → diindárro N
irreligion'
carruurnímo NF 'beingachild,dóqon NM [AP1] 'fool' → doqonnímo N
foolishness'
Similarly the attachment of the interrogative suffix, -kéel-tée 'which, what',
lowers any High tones in the stem:
(63)gúri NM [AP2] 'house'
→
mìis NM [AP2| 'table'
→·

náag NF [AP1] 'woman'

The marking of subordinate forms follows basically the same pattern as for
suffix verbs: subordinate clause verbs are distinguished from main clause verbs
and will carry the case marking for the role of the clause in the main sentence.
Relative clause forms show reduced agreement when their subject is
coreferential with the head of the clause. The effect of this reduction is shown
below for present general and past simple forms, where the forms exhibit the
default absolutive case:

"In (87a) the head nominal qálabka 'the equipment' is object of the verb èeg
'look at' and the absolutive case marking occurs on the relative clause verb
shaqèe 'work'. In (87b) the same head nominal is subject of a verbless sentence
and here the relative verb carries subject marking. We can compare the different
inflection on the relative clause verb shaqèe 'work'.
A second agreement pattern emerges when the gap in the relative clause is
subject of the relative clause verb. When this occurs the relative verb shows a
reduced agreement pattern, called 'convergent' by Andrzejewski (1968). These
reduced agreement forms show a smaller number of person distinctions and, in
present tense forms, a segmental change. The person reduction alone can beSOMALI96s h o w n i n the past simple forms o f súg ' w a i t f o r ' below, w h i c h can be compared

"H o w e v e r , as w i t h English prepositions, some verbsrequire them to introduce a second or third obligatory argument (for example

will continue to call them verbal adpositions, while recognising the shortcomings
of the label. The position of adpositions in the verbal group is described in
chapter 6, and the coalescence rules which affect them are described in chapter
3.
We might note that there are other ways of marking spatial and temporal
relations: firstly, Somali has borrowed one nominal preposition from Arabic,
ilâa 'until', which therefore forms a class of its own. It is used pre-nominally to
form prepositional phrases, e.g. ilâa berrito 'until tomorrow', iláa Hargeysá 'as
far as Hargeysa'. Secondly, a very productive way of describing location
involves nominal possessor-possessed constructions using the suffixed
possessive determiners, as described in 4.6.4, for example:
(111)(112)gúriga hóostìisa
gúri-ga
hóos-tììsa
house-the underneath-its
'underneath the house' lit. 'the house its underneath'
(cf. hóos NF 'underneath')
gúriga hórtìisa
gúri-ga
hór-tìisa
house-the front-its
'in front of the house' lit. 'the house its front' (cf. hór NF 'front')In these constructions both elements are noun phrases. Such nouns of location,
ág N F 'near(ness)', dhéx N F 'middle, centre', hóos N F 'underneath', hór N F
'front', etc. may also function as adverbs: occurring immediately before the verb
in the verbal group to modify the meaning of the head verb, for example:
(113)biyaha
wasakhda ah laga
dhex helaa
water-the dirt-the
is one-in middle finds
'one finds (them) within dirty water'4.6Determiners[BCH25.11-12]The determiners are a class of elements that are suffixed to nouns. There are
four types: definite articles, demonstratives, interrogatives and possessives.
Each type has a masculine form beginning with k- and a feminine form beginning
with t- to agree with the head noun's gender. The determiners do not show
plural agreement with the head noun. Their initial consonants undergo various
sandhi processes when attached to nominal stems, as described in 3.2.1. ManySOMALI112of the determiners can stand alone as verbal arguments like a kind of
pronominal, as we shall see.
4.6.1 Definite articles
There are two definite articles, carrying a distinction of distance in space and
time, shown with examples below:
(114)
Masculine
Feminine
náagta
nínkaNon-remote article
ka
ta
'the woman (non-remote)'
'the man (non-remote)'Remote article
kii
tíi
náagtii 'the woman (remote)
ninkii
'the man (remote)'I f the referent of the noun is distant from the speaker, or is in the past, the
remote forms kíiItíi are used; the article ka/ta is unmarked spatially, and is used
for referents temporally located in the present and the future. This distinction
has a discourse analogue: the determiner kíiItíi is used as a form of discourse
anaphora, picking out entities introduced earlier in the discourse, as described in
chapter 9.
When the article is the last element in the noun phrase it will carry subject
marking, and undergo the changes exemplified below:
(115)Absolutive
ninka
náagta
ninkii
náagtiiSubject
ninku
nàagtu
ninkii
nâagtiiThe article ka/ta undergoes a segmental change to ku/tu, while the article kiiltii
undergoes a tonal lowering.
The articles may occur without a head nominal as a kind of pronominal,
e.g. (116); in this function they may occur in the plural forms in (117),
undifferentiated for gender:
(116)(a)
(b)kii
yimi
the:M came
'the one (MASC) who came'
tii
kalé
the:F
other
'the other one (FEM)'GRAMMATICAL CATEGORIES(117)(a)
(b)kúwa
kúwíi113'the ones (non-remote)'
'the ones (remote)'There is no indefinite article, nor as exist in some Cushitic languages, paucal or
individuating suffixes.37 There is however one element ku 'one' (feminine tu;
plural kuwo) with a very limited distribution, which may be a relic of such an
element. This word does not occur suffixed to nominals but as the head of a
few constructions, especially with the adjective kalé 'other', e.g.:
(118)ku kalé
kuwo kalé'another one (MASC)'
'some others, some more'4.6.2 Demonstratives
There are four demonstrative determiners, which are suffixed to the noun and
which undergo the same rules of sandhi as other determiners (3.2.1). The
demonstratives divide up the space around the speaker into four zones:
(119)Masculine
kán
káa(s)
kéer
kóoFeminine
tán
táa(s)
té er
tóo'this, these' (close to speaker)
'that, those' (further away from speaker)
'that, those' (in the middle distance)
'that, those' (in the far distance)The basic use then is to provide four zones of increasing distance from the
speaker. The demonstratives kán/tán and káas/táas are also used for temporal
and discourse deixis.
When carrying the phrasal subject marking for the NP, these
demonstratives undergo the changes exemplified below, with optional variants
in parentheses:
(120)AbsolutiveSubjectninkán
náagtán
ninkáa(s)
náagtáa(s)

'that man' (middle distance)
'that woman' (middle distance)
'that man' (far distance)

role have plural forms which are not differentiated for gender, e.g.:
(121)\bsolutive
kúwán
kúwáa(s)
kúwéer
kúwóo4.6.3InterrogativesSubject

used to question nouns, for example:
(122)ninkée'which man?'naagtée 'which woman?'","[125, 126, 127, 128, 129]"

do not exhibit the morpho-syntax of nouns. Clitic pronouns can only occur with
a verb and must occur in the strict sequence of clitic elements in the verbal
group described in chapter 6. They form two main sets, subject and object
pronouns, and also include the impersonal subject pronoun la 'one' and the
reflexive and reciprocal pronoun is 'self, each other'.
4.2.1 Subject clitic pronouns
The set of these pronouns is:

3PLaan
aad

'inclusive' means 'including the addressee(s)'. The forms in parentheses are
optional short forms that may be used when the context permits. Note that 3 SG
F and 3 PL are both ay; however the ambiguity is resolved by the accompanying
verb forms. The 1 SG and 2 SG pronouns may be used for their corresponding
plurals, especially in informal conversation.","[86, 87]"

PhrasesIn this chapter we outline how the lexical categories described in chapter 4
combine to form phrases, the syntactic units that form the building blocks of
sentences. Here we concentrate on their internal structure; in chapter 7 we will
outline how they combine with other elements like sentence type markers and
focus words to form complete sentences of different types. There are two main
phrasal elements: the verbal group, where a verb combines with elements like
adpositions and clitic pronouns, and the noun phrase. One feature of Somali
phrasal syntax is that dependent elements often occur as clitics and in a fixed
order. Apart from these two main types of phrase, it is possible to view the
combinations of verbal adpositions and the noun phrases they govern as forms
of discontinuous phrases, as we discuss in 6.3.
6.1Verbal group (VGP)The verbal group is the core element of a clause and consists minimally of a verb
but may also include adpositions, clitic pronouns, adverbial clitics, and in
auxiliary verb constructions, a dependent verb. We use the term verbal group
rather than verb phrase since the latter is associated in languages like English
with a syntactic unit comprising a verb and its phrasal complements, particularly
noun phrases. As described in Saeed (1984) there is no syntactic evidence for
such a unit in Somali: noun phrase objects, for example, do not form a
constituent with the verb, nor occur in a fixed position relative to the verb, as
we shall see in chapter 7. The verbal group on the other hand may contain clitic
pronouns representing any argument of the verb, including subjects, and they
occur in a fixed position relative to the verb and other elements.","[176, 177, 178]"
"SOMALI244Although the study of these discourse processes in Somali has scarcely
begun we might venture a couple of simple hypotheses which might be tested in
future work. We can take as two basic sentence types: (a) focus sentences with
hàalayàa and (b) non-focus sentences with waa. We can identify in each a core,
as follows:
(50) Focus sentences with bàalayàa
X-[CORE FOCUS...Z...VPG]-Y(51) Non-focus sentences with waa
X-[CORE waa - VPG]-YIn both sentence types typical participant NPs can only occur in positions X and
Y if they are activated and represented by clitic pronouns in the core.106 We can
call position X the topic and position Y the afterthought topic, respectively,
understanding that more than one NP can occur in either position. As we have
seen certain unactivated or new elements may occur in these positions without
being topics: adverbials and locative NPs can occur in both X and Y, and 'heavy'
elements like complement clauses can occur in position Y. In the focus sentence
pattern (50) position Z may be occupied by either new or activated nominals but
the latter do not act as topics in this position.
This is only the slightest sketch but allows us to reflect that a combination
of overt focus markers (hàalayàa), word order, and clitic pronouns linguistically
signal certain important pragmatic roles, particularly of focus and topic. It will
require the study of different sentence types in texts across of range of different
genres to fill out these few tentative suggestions.
It is perhaps worth noting that the relationship between a topic and the
core predication may be of various types. Most frequently, the topic is
coreferential with a core argument expressed by a pronoun, as in (52) below:
(52)Anigu geel,
Me
camelsido
sheepiyo
andriyo
goatsbadan
many' M e , I have MANY CAMELS, SHEEP AND GOATS.'baan
FOC+Ihaystaa.
have[TD 84.33]Though this coreferential element is most commonly a clitic pronoun, it may
also be another element with a referential function, for example a possessive
determiner as in:
(53)Hooyo, artiga ilmahaygu wacal
ma aha.
mother me
child-my
bastard
not is
'Mother, (as for) me, my child is not a bastard.' [SHN 106.1]DISCOURSE245In this example, since the topic aniga 'me' is not coreferential with the subject
of the sentence ilmahaygu 'my child', it is not subject marked.
The topic may also be in a set-subset, or partitive, relationship with an
argument in the core, as in (54) below:
(54)hase yeeshee
saddexdii bakheyl mid
ka
mid
ah
however
three-the
miser

be
ayaa diiday inuu wax ka
bixiyo qiimihii feynuuska.
FOC refused that-he thing from pay
cost-the light-the
'however, the three misers, ONE OF THEM refused to pay anything towards the
cost of the light' [SNR 14. 2-3]9.2Reference assignmentThere is a range of nominal forms available to speakers to help manage
reference to entities within a discourse. Indefinite nominals, which are often
used to introduce new entities into the discourse are unmarked, i.e. there is no
indefinite marker or article in Somali. See for example the first line of a story:
(55)Waa baa waxaa israacay
laba nin oo saaxiib
time FOC wáxaa RE-accompanied two man and friend
ahaan jirtey
be:INF used-to
'ONCE there travelled together two men who were friends.'
[MCI 12.17]In this sentence the two referring nominals waa 'time', and laba nin 'two men'
(lit. 'two of man') are new and undefined.
When the first mention has been made an entity is activated as part of the
frame of attention and may be referred to by a range of definite nominals and
pronouns. In this story the two men are referred to in the second sentence by
the subject clitic pronoun ay 'they' (4.2.1), and the possessive determiner koodl-tood 'their' (4.6.4), both marked in bold below:
(56)Goor ay
labadoodu meel marahayaan bay
waxay
time they two-their
place pass:PROG
FOC+they wáxa+they
iswarsadeen in

RE-askedthat
man

thing-the+he liking be
that
Eebbe ugu
roonado sheegto.
God
to+for grant
tell.
'As the two of them were passing along, they agreed that each man should say
what he would like God to grant him.'[MCI 12.18-19]246SOMALIAs can be seen, within this sentence the pattern is repeated. A new quantified
nominal nin walba 'each man' is introduced by an indefinite NP and then this
nominal is anaphorically referred to by a subject clitic pronoun uu 'he' and then
later in the sentence by the zero third person object pronoun (4.2.2).
In subsequent sentences the men, singly or together, are referred to by
noun phrases containing the remote definite article -kiiltii 'the' (4.6.1) which is
used for referents distant in space or temporally in the past and which in
discourse has an anaphoric function. Thus in successive sentences we find ninkii kale 'the other man', laba-dii nin 'the two men', as well as further uses of
the subject clitic pronouns ay 'they', uu 'he' and zero third person object
pronouns.
In the middle of the story another character is introduced by an indefinite
noun nin rati subag uu  saaran wata 'a man driving a camel loaded with
clarified butter' :
(57)Markaas muddo yar dabadeed baa iyagoo meel marahay
time-that period little after-its FOC they-and place pass:PROG
waxaa
ka
hor yimid nin rati
subag
uu 
wáxaa
from front came man camel clarified:buttter he on
saaran
wata.
loaded
drive.
'A short time after that, while they were passing a place, there came before
them a man driving a camel loaded with clarified butter.' [MCI 13.9-11]In the next clause following (57) the two men are referred to again, this time by
a noun phrase containing a demonstrative determiner -kaasl-taas 'that, those'
(4.6.2) used deictically for objects in the middle distance, laba-daas nin 'those
two men'. The new character is referred to with the remote definite article -kiil­
tii: nin-kii safar-ka ahaa 'the man who was a traveller'. In this way the
demonstrative picks out the entities, the two men, 'on the other side', so to
speak, of the newly introduced character. The two types of determiner are used
to operate a form of discourse deixis.
Thus we can see a series of nominal forms being used to manage reference
to entities within the discourse: indefinite nominals, clitic pronouns, nominals
with the remote article -kiiltii, and with the middle distance demonstrative kaasl-taas. One other feature of this system is worth noting: clitic pronouns
must occur within the verbal group; therefore when a pronoun is selected
elsewhere in a sentence, to act as a topic, or head of a relative clause, or in
focus, then an independent pronoun must be used. Thus in (56) above we findDISCOURSE247the appositive relative clause iyagoo meel marahay 'they, passing a place'
headed by the independent pronoun iyága 'they, them' (4.1.3).
9.3Analysis of a textTo look at the features of information structure in a little more detail we may
examine some brief extracts from a traditional story Guurdoon 'Choosing a
Bride' in Axmed Xartan Xaange (1988:49-50.). This story is given in its
entirety in Appendix II. The first sentence of the story is (58):

livestock they cared:for
'Once there was a man and his wife and they had some livestock which they
raised.' (i.e. 'and they raised livestock for their living')In this sentence, the initial element, the time adverbial waa 'one time, once' is
focused by bàa, while the first characters, the man and his wife are introduced in
a wáxa(a) cleft. A second cleft introduces a relative clause on an indefinite NP
xoolo 'livestock'. The second sentence is:
(59)Waaggii dambe baa mil  dhashay reerkii,

aháynThese are the absolutive case forms which occur when the relative clause is not
subject of the main clause; when the clause is subject, all high tones will be
lowered and the present general form a(h) will carry the nominative suffix -i,
becoming ihi by vowel assimilation.","[117, 118]"
"SOMALI152There are also a number of more restricted ways of forming verbal nouns,
including the affix tin, for example báq V INTR 'be afraid' →baqdín (←*baqtin)
N F 'fear'; kúf V INTR 'fall, slip' → kuftín N F 'falling over'.
5.3.3 Noun to noun derivation
There are a number of suffixes which alter the meaning of nouns to form derived
nouns. Once again such suffixes form a continuum from very productive
elements to others which are more restricted and in some cases have become
semantically opaque.
Here we list some of the more productive and
semantically transparent suffixes.
5.3.3. J Derived abstract nouns
There are several suffixes which when added to concrete nouns create related
abstract nouns. The difference of meaning between these affixes is sometimes
difficult to characterise. This difficulty is compounded by degrees of variability
and semantic shift associated with particular words. We attempt to reflect
semantic distinctions in the English glosses but these are of course only
approximations.
A suffix nimo is added to a concrete noun N to form an abstract noun
'being N' or 'the state of N'. The derived nouns belong to declension 6 and are
therefore feminine, for example:
(52)Noun
Derived noun
askár NF
'soldiers'
askarnimó
'being a soldier, military service'
dóqon NM
'fool'
doqonnimó
'being a fool, foolishness'
míd
N M/F 'one'
midnimó
'being one, unity'
náag N F
'woman'
naagnimó
'being a woman'
saaxiibNM
'friend'
saaxiibnimó
'being a friend, friendship'
wìll
ΝΜ
'boy'
wiilnimó
'being a boy, boyhood'A suffix tooyo is more restricted in use: typically for concrete nouns
denoting people it creates abstract nouns meaning variously 'acting like N',
'experience of N' or 'role of N'. Once again the derived nouns belong to
declension 6 and are therefore feminine, for example:
(53)Noun
bóqor N M
'king'
mádax N M
'head'
saaxiib Ν Μ
'friend'
walàal NM
'brother'Derived noun
bortooyó
'kingdom'
madaxtooyó
'presidency'
saaxiib tooyó ' friendliness '
walaaltooyó
'brotherhood'WORD DERIVATION153One suffix (i)yad seems to be a borrowed affix from Arabic, -iyat, and is
used to form feminine abstract nouns from loan words, for example:
dibloomasiyád
'diplomacy',
teknoolojiyád
'technology',
Maarkisiyád
'Marxism'.
5.3.3.2 Possessive suffix le
The addition of the suffix le to a noun N creates a masculine noun belonging to
declension 7, meaning 'owner of N' or 'possessor of N', for example:
(54)Noun
biyó
Ν Μ 'water'
géel
N M 'camels'
hílib N M 'meat
wáran NM 'spear'Derived noun
biyóole 'water-owner, one who possesses water'
géelle
'camel-owner'
hílible
'possessor of meat, butcher'
wáranle 'possessor of spear, warrior'As shown above, if the base noun ends in  the vowel is lengthened before the
suffix.
These derived nouns are in fact on the borderline between derivational
suffixes and compounds since they are clearly related to headless relative clauses
with the adjective léh 'possessing, owning'. See for example the relative clause:
(55)ran
dukàan léh
man
shop
owning
'a man who owns a shop'By deleting the head noun phrase and suffixing the adjective (dropping h) we
can form the associated derived noun dukáanle 'shop-owner'. Thus it is possible
to view these derived nouns as the result simply of suffixation on a base noun,
like dukàan N M 'shop', or as a way of nominalising a clause. Moreover,
depending on the analysis of le, this can be seen as either morphological
derivation or as the kind of noun-verb/adjective compounding we describe in
5.4.3 below.
5.3.3.3 Antonym suffix darro
The suffix darro may be attached to certain abstract nouns, usually denoting
something good or praiseworthy and forms a feminine declension 6 noun
denoting an unfavourable antonym, for example:
(56)ayàan N M
aqóon N F'good luck
'knowledge'ayaandarró
aqoondarró'bad luck'
'ignorance'SOMALI154âxdi N M

'injustice, wrong'The affix can also be used as a more general privative suffix with concrete
nouns:

afdarró
áf
N M 'edge, sharpness'
afdarró
dhìig N M 'blood'
dhiigdarró5.4Compounds'muteness, speechlessness'
'lack of edge, bluntness'
'anaemia'Despite the fact that Somali has a wide and productive range of compounding
processes, this area of the grammar has received little attention.56 The important
role of compounding in the creation of new vocabulary after the adoption of
Somali as the national language of Somalia is described in Caney (1984).
However there have been very few linguistic studies of compounds. Here we
limit ourselves to an overview of the main types. Since, as outlined in chapters
3 and 4, accentual patterns (APs) are associated with words, they provide a
formal criterion for identifying compounds. We can take as an example the
sentence in (58), in which each independent word has its own accentual pattern:
(58)Hór
ú
márii
front
to
pass-CAUS-IMPER:SG
'Move it to the front, move it forward!","[166, 167, 168, 169]"
"SOMALI176Another important use of the genitive construction is when numerals are
used to count nouns, for example:
(51)labá
meelóod
two:F:ABS
place:F:PL:GEN
'two places' (lit. 'two of places')Here the numeral is the head of the construction and the counted noun is
dependent: the whole noun phrase has the gender of the numeral and the
numeral will attract any determiners: see for example the following feminine
noun phrase:
(52) labáda і
two-the:F:ABS man:M:SG:GEN
'the two men' (lit. ' the two of man')
These two examples also show a distinction in the behaviour of the counted
noun: all nouns except declension 1 occur in a singular form after all numerals,
as in (52), while declension 1 nouns occur in plural genitive forms after
numerals greater than one, as in (51). This genitive construction also occurs
with some other quantifying nouns, for example immisa 'how many', méeqa
'how many?' and dhawr 'several', for example:
(53)dhàwr
nín
several:ABS man:SG:GEN
'several men' (lit. 'several of man')
As described in 4.6.4, the possessive determiner construction has
extended uses in expressing partitive quantification, as in (54), and spatial and
temporal location, as in (55):
(54)(a)(b)(55)(a)dádka
sáddexdóod
people-the
three-their
'three of the people'
dádka
gíddigóod
people-the
all-their'
'all of the people'
mìiska
hóostìisa
table-the underneath-its
'underneath the table'PHRASES(b)177habeennimáda hórtèeda
nightfall-the
front-its-the
'before nightfall' (lit. 'nightfall its front')6.2.3 Other modifiers
Nouns and noun phrases may also be modified by the following dependent
items.
6.2.3.1 Adjectives (4.4, 6.1.5)
Adjectives used attributively follow the head noun and suffixed determiners and
are formally equivalent to restrictive relative clauses, as discussed in 6.1.5
above.70 Some adjectives agree with plural head nominals by a process of
reduplication, described in 3.5. Sequences of adjectives follow the rules for
restrictive relatives clauses, i.e. are linked by oo 'and' on an indefinite head NP
and by  'and' on a definite NP (8.1). Some examples are:
(56)(a)(b)(c)(d)shúqul adág
work
hard
'hard work'
buuró
dhaadhèer
mountains high
'high mountains'
wìil dhèer όο dhuubán
boy tall
and thin
'a tall thin boy'
wìilka dhèer  dhuubán
boy-the tall
and thin
'the tall thin boy'6.2.3.2 A ttributive adjectives (4.4.3)
Attributive adjectives are not used predicatively and do not mark plural
agreement by reduplication. When co-occurring with predicative adjectives or
relative clauses they occur first after the head nominal. There seems little
justification to view these as a form of relative clause modification. Examples:
(57)(a)(b)xáragga saré
skin-the topmost
'the outer skin'
dhínac kastá
side
every
'every side'SOMALI178()márkíi

The details of relative cause structure are given in chapter 8. It is very common
for an attribute of a head nominal to be described by a relative clause containing
a noun as complement of yahay 'be' or the adjective léh 'having', for example:
(60)(a)(b)(c)(d)(e)nín
xòog
léh
man strength has: SUBORD
'a strong man' (lit. 'a man who has strength')

kelí
áh
food-the
solitude is:SUBORD
'the only food' (lit. 'the food which is aloneness')6.2.4 Multiple modifiers
One rule is common to all nominal modifiers: after the first modifier all others
must be introduced by a conjunction, oo or , both meaning 'and'. So for
example if one adds a further nominal modifier to a genitive NP, it must be
introduced by a conjunction:
(61)[ head taariikhdii] [mod Soomáaliya]  [modberyihii horé]
[history-the ABS ]
[Somalia GEN]
and [times-the
early GEN|
'the early history of Somalia' (lit. 'the history of Somalia and of early times')Similarly with any further modification of a quantified nominal:
(62)labá kóob
óo
shàah áh
two
cup:GEN and tea
is:SUBORD
'two cups of tea' (lit. 'two of cup and which are tea')In examples (56) and (57) above we saw this same behaviour with ordinary and
attributive adjectives. The distinction between the conjunctions oo and  is
discussed further in chapter 8. Basically: on indefinite heads only oo is possible
and there it is a marker of appositive relative clauses; on definite heads  marks
restrictive modification and oo appositive modification. Genitive constructions
necessarily involve restrictive modification so oo is never found in multiple
genitives like:
(63)[head wakaaládda] [mod warárka]  [mod dálka
Ciráaq]
agency-the
news:PL-the
and country-the Iraq
'the Iraqi News Agency' (lit. 'the agency of news and of the country of Iraq')6.3Discontinuous phrasesFrom the examples and analyses thus far in this chapter it may be clear that
much of the information about the semantic relations of a clause is encoded in
the verbal group. With one relation in particular this means that an important
semantic relationship is not reflected syntactically: the governing of NPs by
verbal adpositions. As described in 4.5, the adpositions ú, kú, ká and lá assignSOMALI180various semantic roles to nominals outside the VGP including location, source,
goal, instrument, manner, comitative, etc.
One major function of this
relationship between a verbal adposition and a nominal is to provide adverbial
modification of the clause, in particular ú governing the noun si N F 'manner,
way'. See for example:
(64) Sidée bàad ú sameysey?
way-which FOC+you in did
'How did you do you it?' (lit. 'In which way did you do it?')
(65) Si
xún bùu
ú sameeyey.
way
bad FOC+he in did
'He did it badly.' (lit. 'in a bad way')
The noun si may be modified in any number of ways by determiners, adjectives
and relative clauses to form adverbial expressions and it is useful to refer to the
discontinuous elements as an adverbial unit, e.g.:
(66)sidán... ú
sidáas.
..ú
si diiran ...ú
si qaabdarán...ú
si uun... ú
si wanaagsán ...ú
si badán áh...ú
si cad
áh...
si gàar áh...úú'thus, in this way'
' like that, in that way '
' warmly '
'improperly, incorrectly'
'somehow, in one way or another'
' well'
' abundantly '
'clearly, plainly'
'especially'When talking of these adverbial units we are in fact identifying a
discontinuous adverbial phrase, a strategy which is also useful in discussing the
commonly used intensifying phrase àad...ú 'much, a lot', e.g.:
(67)Áad bùu
ú jecélyahay.
much FOC+he in liking-is
'He likes it very much.'","[190, 191, 192, 193, 194, 195]"
"SOMALI76It is clear that in form the second series object pronouns are quite distinct from
the primary series and resemble the possessive determiners -kàyl-tày 'mine' etc.
described in 4.6, except of course that the pronouns have no overt third person
forms.
4.2.3 Non-specific subject pronoun
The non-specific subject pronoun la, which we gloss in English as 'one', takes
third person masculine singular verbal agreement and is typically used with a
transitive verb when the speaker does not know or wishes to suppress the
identity of the subject, for example:
(61)(62)Wàa la xaday.
wàa
la
xaday
DM
one
stole: 3 SG M
Tt was stolen/, lit. 'One stole it'
Wàa lagu arkay.
wàa
la-ku
arkay
DM
one-y ou:SG saw:3 SG M
'You (SG) were seen/, lit. 'One saw you (SG)'This pronoun is also used when the subject is so general as to be vague, for
example in the formulaic beginning to stories wáxaa la yidhí 'what one said...'
or 'It is told... ', or as in the following example:
(63)Dúmarku waa beló tóo haahànyahày.
dúmar-ku
waa
beló
la+ú
baahan-yahay
women-the DM
disaster
one+of needful:ADJ-is:3SGM
'Women are a necessary evil',
(lit. 'Women are a disaster which one is needful o f )These uses mean that constructions with la are functionally equivalent to some
uses of passive constructions in other languages, and indeed there is no syntactic
passive in Somali. There are other grammatical mechanisms which share the
functional domain of passives in other languages, as we shall see, for example
the verbal derivational affix -am described in 5.1.4, which removes an agent
from a causative verb and promotes the causee to subject.
The pronoun la has often been called an impersonal subject pronoun but
we avoid the term here because unlike some impersonal constructions in other
languages, such as impersonal passives, la cannot be used with intransitiveGRAMMATICAL CATEGORIES77verbs. Thus one cannot say (64a) below but must instead use a full nominal qóf
N M 'person' in (64b):
(64)(a)*Wàa
la
dhinlay.
DM
one died
'One died', 'Someone died'
(b)
Qóf
bàa dhintay.
person FOC died
'A person died', 'Someone died'Note too that la can only be used for human entities and is thus restricted to
verbs which could have a human subject.
As described in chapter 6, la occurs in the verbal group in the same
position as other subject pronouns and thus precedes adpositions and object
clitic pronouns, with which it coalesces. Earlier, in 3.3.3 we described its
coalescence with adpositions. The following shows la combining with object
clitic pronouns:
(65)la
la

+

+i
ku
na
ina'me'
→
'you (SG)' →
'us (EXC)
→
'us (INC)
→lay
lagu
nala
laynaAn example is in (63) above. Note that la undergoes metathesis when combining
with a monosyllabic morpheme beginning with a nasal, as in nala in (65). This
also occurs in combinations with the negative word má, which normally
precedes the elements of the verbal group; compare (66a) and (66b):
(66)(a)(b)Má'uu cunó.
må-uu cunó
not-he
eat:NEG
'He doesn't eat it.'
Lamá curio.
la-má
cunó
one-not eat:NEG
'One does not eat it.', It isn't eaten.'","[90, 91, 92]"
"I n other verbal forms subject marking involves a v o w e l change in addition t o the
accentual change; compare the case marking on the verb wád ' d r i v e ' in (17a)
and (17b) below:SUBORDINATE CLAUSES(17)(a)

"4.6.4 Possessives
The possessive determiners show once again the class features of being suffixed
to a head noun, of agreeing with it in gender and of undergoing the sandhi rules
in 3.2.1. The set is:GRAMMATICAL CATEGORIES(125)Masculine

'his horse'
'our (EXC) camels'115'my'
'your (SG)''his''her'
'our (EXC)'
'our (INC)'
'your (PL)'
'their'For example:
(cf. gúri N M 'house')
(cf. fáras N M 'horse')
(cf. gèel N M COLL 'camels')These forms are interesting in their morphology. Firstly we may note that
k- forms attach to masculine nouns and t- forms to feminine nouns as usual with
determiners. However these forms consist of two elements: a possessive
determiner followed by the definite article kalta described in 4.6.1, e.g. kày-ka
→ kàyga 'my'. In this case the definite article undergoes normal determiner
sandhi but there are also some unusual rules. Firstly, wherever the possessive
element ends in a consonant other than n the first consonant of the article is
dropped, e.g. kìis-ka → kìisa rather than the predicted *kìiska. Secondly when
the possessive ends in n, the initial consonant of the article assimilates to n, e.g.
kèen-ka → kèenna 'our (INC MASC)', tè en-ta → tèenna 'our (INC FEM)'.
This combination of possessive and article is the basic form but
possessives occur with the full range of determiners, with associated meanings,
for example:
(126)remote article kíi/tìi :
demonstrative káas/táas:
interrogative kée/tée:gúhgàagii
'your house (remote)'
gúrigàagáas 'that house of yours'
gurigaagée? 'which house of yours?'","[129, 130]"
"'Ali came'
'Ah'
'Ah'Example (34b) is not a possible reply.
In addition to these features, bàalayàa constructions display a range of
morpho-syntactic behaviours which seem unusual when compared to other
sentences. These are particularly evident when the focused element is a subject.
We have mentioned some of these features before but we can summarise them
below:
(35)(a) A focused subject is not subject marked but occurs in the absolutive case.
(b) A verb agreeing with a focused subject shows a much reduced set of
agreement markers (Andrzejewski's (1968) 'restrictive paradigm') and a
distinct accentual pattern, API (4.3.4.13).
(c) A focused subject may not be doubled by a clitic pronoun in the verbal
group (6.1.2).
(d) Negative bàalayàa sentences employ the constituent negative word άαn
'not' rather than the main clause mà 'not' (see below).",[207]

"SOMALI323.2.3 Verbal causative affix
As will be discussed in 4.3.1, the structure ofthe main suffix type ofverb can be
described schematically as:
(21)[ROOT - LEX - AGR - INFL]In (21) ROOT represents the verb's root; LEX represents one or more ofthe set
of lexical affixes which create derived verbs; AGR are the affixes which mark
agreement with the person, number and gender ofthe verb's subject; and INFL
are the markers of tense, mood, and aspect. At each morphological juncture,
marked -, phonological changes take place. In this section we provide one or
two examples of sound changes at the juncture between ROOT and LEX, using as
an example the causative affix. This affix has the form -/ in most verbal
conjugations.20 When this is added to verbal roots ending in g or q these
consonants palatalise to j:
(22)dég INTR 'alight'
déji
jòog INTR 'stop, stay'
jóoji
dàaq INTR 'graze' dáaji TR 'puttograze'
rúq INTR 'be uprooted' rúji TR 'uproot'TR
TR'cause to alight, unload'
'cause to stop, halt'This affix is also involved in a vowel assimilation rule similar to that described in
3.2.2: verbs consisting ofshort monosyllables ending in x, c, or the glottal stop '
have their root vowel assimilated to the affix:
(23)box INTR 'go out'
bíxi TR 'cause to go out, take out'
dhác INTR 'fall, happen'
dhíci TR 'make something happen, cause'
bá' INTR 'beruined' bí 'i TR 'ruin'Once again this rule does not apply to long vowels: ràac TR 'follow', ráaci TR
'cause to follow, send along', but not *ríici.
3.2.4 Verbalmiddle voice affix
In this section we provide some examples of sound changes associated with the
middle voice affix, discussed in 5.1.6. This affix has the underlying form -at in
most verbal forms21. To show the sound changes it is useful to give a typical set
ofverbal endings: we use the past simple paradigm ofthe root verb kèen 'bring':33PHONOLOGICAL RULES(24)(Clitic PRO)

t + ay
n + ay
t + een
~ + eenAs can be seen, the person markers t, n and ~ (representing a null marker or
gap) intersect with the INFL elements to provide a five way person distinction
that is extended further by pronouns.
When the middle voice affix -at- is positioned between the verb stem and
the verb ending, a number of sound changes result. Firstly, if the affix is
followed by a vowel, then its final t becomes d:
(25)joogsaday'I stopped myself(←*joogsatay)Secondly if -at- is followed by a person marker t, then the sequence tt simplifies
to t:
(26)joogsatay'she stopped herself(←*joogsattay)Thirdly this affix often produces the environment for the stem contraction rule
described in 3.1.4:
(27)*dubatay
*gurataydubtay
gurtay'(I) baked (it) for myself
'(I) collected (it) for myselfAs can be seen, stem contraction forms a juncture between the remaining t
consonant of the affix and the verb stem: in this position the affix t undergoes
the same sound changes as the t ofthe nominal determiners (3.2.1) with one
important difference. The parallels are:
(28)(a) t → d after x, c, q:
*seextay
→
seexday
*goctay
→
gocday
*fíiqtay
→
fíiqday
(b) t may become dh after dh:
xidhtay or xidhdhay'(I) wentto sleep'
'(I) remembered'
'(I) peeled (it) for myself
'(I) closed (it) for myselfSOMALI34The difference is that when the verb stem ends in d, we find regressive
assimilation at thejuncture, then simplification:
(29)*qaadatay
*qaadtay
*qaattay
qaatay'Itook (it) for myself
(stem contraction)
(regressive assimilation)
(simplification)→
→
→This form contrasts with:
(30) *qaadattay
qaadatay'You took (it) for yourself
(simplification)→There are two interesting points here: firstly the intervocalic -t- produced by
simplification does not voice intervocalically like an underlying single t, e.g.:
(31)waanjoogsaday
waan qaatay(←*joogs-at-ay)
(←*qaattay)'I
'Istoppedmyself'
took (it) for myself'Secondly the regressive assimilation of the sequence dt → tt with the middle
voice affix contrasts with the progressive assimilation of the sequence dt →dd
with the nominal determiners (e.g. bád+ ta → bádda 'the ocean'). We shall see
further examples of this dependence of phonological rules on grammatical
status.
3.2.5 Verbal agreement affixes
In this section we provide one or two examples of sound changes at the juncture
in verbs between the verbal stem and the agreement markers, AGR. The
agreement marker t (2sG and 3SGF) undergoes progressive sound changes at the
juncture with the verb stem and thus acts like the t of the determiner suffix and
not the t of the middle voice affix, for example: *qaad + tay → qaadday

coalescence rules which apply when words form part of phrases and sentences.
This merging of forms, a kind of external sandhi, is sometimes a feature of the
style of speech: whether the speech is fast or slow, formal or informal.
However many of the rules are not dependent on the style of speech and are
obligatory. There has been very little study of the variation in coalescence
across speech styles but in our examples we try to note those cases which seem
obligatory. As will be seen, it is the functional categories like verbal adpositions,
focus and negative words, verbal pronouns and conjunctions which are involved
in these rules of phonological merger. We might identify these elements as
clitics, entities whose grammatical status lies between the affix and the
independent word. However it is important to note that cliticisation and
coalescence are in principle distinct: some clitics like the conjunctions -na 'and'
and -se 'but' (4.9) must attach to a preceding host but do not undergo
phonological merger with them, while the elements described below only merge
under certain conditions. Some coalesce only when adjacent to certain
grammatical categories, as do the verbal adpositions, for example ú 'to, for',
while others, like the verbal pronouns, do so only in certain phonological
environments. We select here a few characteristic examples; further examples
appear in the texts in Appendix II.
3.3.1 Verbal subject pronouns
The subject pronouns, which as described in 6.1.1 occur in first position in the
verbal group, obligatorily coalesce with the sentence type marker waa (34
below) and with the focus words baa and ayàa (35-6) when they precede the
verbal group:SOMALI36(34)Wàan raagay

was:late
'I was late.'
Other examples: *waa + aad 'you' → waad, *waa + uu 'he' → wuu, *waa + ay'
she/they' →way, *waa + aannu 'we (EXC)' → waannu, *waa + aynu 'we (INC)' →
waynu, *waa + aydin 'you (PL)' → waydin.

Other examples: *bàa + aad 'you' → bàad, *bàa + uu 'you' → bùu, etc.

man-the FOC +I with spoke
'I spoke with THE MAN.'
Other examples: *ayaa + aad 'you' → ayàad, *ayàa + uu 'you' → ayùu, etc.
There is some dialectal variation in the behaviour of these pronouns with the
negative word má. In northern dialects the pronouns cliticise onto the negative
word má with an epenthetic glottal stop at thejuncture and do not coalesce: má
+ aan →má 'aan, má + aad → má 'aad, má + uu →mú 'uu, etc. In central and
southern dialects of standard Somali, coalescence occurs, together with vowel
assimilation, for example: ma + aan → máan, má + aad → màad, má + uu →
mùu etc. The two forms are:
(37)Má'uulMuu helín
má+uu helin
not+he
found:NEG
'He did not find it. 'In subordinate clauses, these pronouns are attracted out ofthe verbal group and
position after the initial constituent of the clause. This may be a noun phrase
heading a relative clause (38), including one ofthe noun phrases oftime, manner
etc. whose relative clauses act adverbially (39), or the phrase waxa 'what, the
thing' introducing a cleft (40). If these elements end in a final -a vowel the
pronouns will always coalesce with them, as shown, with wáxa also undergoing
vowel assimilation:PHONOLOGICAL RULES(38)(39)(40)37baabùurkuu wadó

"213[NON-SUBJ]
[SUBJ]The effects on verbal morphology of this case marking are described in 4.3.4.13.
8.1.3 Subject-verb agreement
As described in 4.3, verbs normally show agreement with their subjects.
However since the relativised position in a relative clause is marked by a gap,
the relative verb may have this gap as its subject. When this happens a special,
reduced form of agreement is marked on the relative clause verb. Compare for
example the relative clause in (18a) below, where this happens, with that in
(18b), where it does not (note that all of the nominals are masculine plural):
(18)(a)
(b)nimánka buugágga keená
men-the books-the bring
'the men who bring the books'
buugágga nimanku keenàan
books-the
men-the
bring
'the books which the men bring'In (18a) above this reduced agreement, part of what Andrzejewski (1968, 1969,
1975a) calls the convergent paradigm, occurs because the subject of the relative
clause verb keená 'bring' is a gap, coreferential with the head nimánka 'the
men'. In (18b) the relative clause verb keenàan has an overt subject nimanku
'the men' and thus full agreement, part of what Andrzejewski (op.cit.) calls the
divergent paradigm, occurs.
This inflectional distinction survives under the main clause case marking
described in 8.1.2. The subject-marked version of (18a) occurs in (19) below;
and the subject-marked version of (18b) is in (20):
(19)(20)Nimánka buugágga keenaa waa kúwán.
men-the
books-the
bring
DM
these
'The men who bring the books are these.'
(i.e. 'These are the men who bring the books')
Buugágga nimanku
keenaan waa kúwán.
books-the men-the
bring
DM
these
'The books which the men bring are these.'",[228]
"GRAMMATICAL CATEGORIES83In (77b) the auxiliary verb jir signifies the past habitual TAM form and carries the
inflection.
As we shall see in sections 4.3.4-6, there are four auxiliary constructions
that act as part of the tense-aspect-mood system. The future marked by dóon
'will'; the past habitual with jír 'be, exist'; the conditional with the fused
adjective and verb form lahaa 'was possessing', from léh ADJ 'possessing' and
yahay 'be'; and the progressives marked by partial coalescence with hay 'have'.
In these constructions the auxiliary verbs have lost their independent lexical
content and function as markers of the relevant TAM distinction. In addition
there are a small number of verbs which act like these auxiliaries while
maintaining their lexical content. The most important of these are given below:
(78)Verb

Waan tégi
gaadhay
DM+I
go:INF almost:do-PAST
T almost went, I nearly went'Since they do not function as part of the TAM system and retain lexical content,
we will analyse these verbs as main verbs which, unusually for Somali, take
infinitival complements; these are discussed further in 6.1.3 and 8.4.2.
4.3.3 InflectionalcategoriesVerbal inflection carries information from a number of sentence-level semantic
and syntactic systems. We provide a basic list of these below:
(79) Inflectional categories of the verb
Tense
Aspect
Mood
Negation
Sentence subordination
These systems interact on a relatively restricted number of inflectional endings
and auxiliary verbs with the result that verbal inflection in Somali is mostSOMALI84economically and clearly represented in a paradigmatic form, as in the next
section. These sentence-level systems also interact with lexically-based semantic
distinctions, such as those of aktionsart, or situation type, for example between
stative and dynamic verbs. Stative verbs occur in all three morphological classes,
for example:
(80)(a) Suffix class statives
búk
'be ill'
haysó
húb
hürud'have, possess""
'be certain'
'be asleep, sleep'
'be (in a place), remain, stay
jòog
muuqó
'appear, seem'
(b) Prefix class statives
yiil
'be (in a place)'
yiqiin
'know'
(c) yahay
'be'
(c)As the terms suggest, stative verbs portray situations as static or unchanging for
their duration, whereas dynamic verbs, such as inchoatives and causatives, allow
speakers to view situations as having internal temporal structure, or subparts.
This distinction has an impact on the sentence-level systems of aspect and
mood. Stative verbs do not, for example, occur in progressive forms or for the
most part in imperative sentences.29 In addition, in paradigms where both do
occur, stative and dynamic verbs may have different aspectual interpretations.
With dynamic verbs the paradigm we label present habitual describes a repeated
or regular activity, like kèen 'bring' in Wùu keenaa (maalín kastá) 'He brings it
(every day)'. With stative verbs, on the other hand, it signifies a state ongoing
at the time of speaking, like huh 'be certain' in Wàan hubaa ' I am certain'.
In this chapter we simply identify the verbal inflectional forms, leaving all
but the sketchiest discussion of the use and meaning of forms to later chapters.
The inflectional categories in (79) above exhibit the following formal contrasts:
(81)Contrasts in inflectional categories

Past/Present/Future
Aspect:

Mood:

Negation:

example, tense and aspect are only marked in declarative sentences; there is no
negation in potential sentences, etc. We can group the possible combinations
into the twelve verbal paradigms below, details of which are given in the next
three sections for suffix verbs, prefix verbs and yahay 'be':

Simple sentencesIn this chapter we examine the structure of simple sentences consisting o f a main
clause. The various ways of joining simple sentences by conjunctions were
described in 4.9 earlier and we leave complex sentences containing subordinate
clauses until the next chapter. When looking at sentences it is useful to
distinguish between three semantic and pragmatic systems which influence their
structure: sentence type, focus and negation. The interaction between these
systems is not symmetrical, for example focus is restricted to declarative and
interrogative sentence types. Moreover each system is sensitive to the
distinction between main (root) clauses and subordinate clauses: sentence type
differentiation and focus are restricted to main clauses, and negation shows
different forms in main and subordinate clauses, as we shall see in chapter 8.
Nonetheless the structure of main clauses is determined by these systems and we
organise this chapter in terms of them. We begin with a brief discussion of
sentence types, then go on to describe declarative and interrogative sentences,
for each type distinguishing the effects of negation and of focus. Thereafter we
move onto the other major sentence types.
7.1Sentence typesThe basic pattern is for sentence type to be marked by a combination of verbal
inflection and a sentence type identifying morpheme, which for convenience we
term a marker ( S T M ) (4.8). As we shall see, not all sentence types are unique in
both markers. The sentence types can be classified pragmatically by their
conversational uses, for example allowing the speaker to make questions,
requests, wishes, etc. or semantically, as making various distinctions of
modality, for example expressing judgements of states of affairs as actual orSOMALI184hypothetical. Grammatically, sentence types fall into two groups distinguished
by their ability to mark tense:
(1)SENTENCE TYPES
TENSEDdeclarativeinterrogativeUNTENSEDimperativeoptativepotentialDeclarative and interrogative sentences share the same verbal forms, and
express the full range of tense and aspectual distinctions described in 4.3 earlier.
The other moods each have a unique verbal inflection that does not show tense
or aspectual distinctions. The distinction in (1) corresponds to other differences,
for example, as mentioned above, nominal focus may be used in the tensed
sentence types but not in the untensed types. We begin our discussion with the
sentence types which show tense and aspect differentiation: declaratives and
interrogatives. In each case there are major morpho-syntactic differences
between sentences containing focus and those without.
7.2.","[196, 197, 198, 199]"
"'These are the books which the men bring')The morphological details of reduced agreement forms are given in 4.3.4.13. 90
8.1.4 AttributiveadjectivesAs discussed in 4.4 and 6.1.4, attributive adjectives seem closely related to
restrictive relative clause constructions. They perform the same function
semantically and significantly, it is not possible to form relative clauses with a
copula verb and adjective; compare for example:
(21)(22)nin
géesi
áh
man
b rave: man
is
'a man who is a brave man', 'a brave man'
(a)
nin
dhèer
man
tall
(b)
*nin
dhèer áh
man tall
is
'a tall man', 'a man who is tall'As (22b) shows, it is not possible to form a relative clause where the copula
yahay 'be' occurs with an adjectival complement like dhèer ADJ ' t a l l , as is
possible with a nominal like géesi NM 'brave man, hero'. Multiple attributive
adjectives are joined by oo and  in the same pattern as restrictive relative
clauses:91
(23)(a)(b)hàad
wèyn oo madów
bird
big
and black
'a big black bird'
hàadkíi wèyn  madów
bird-the big
and black
'the big black bird'It is very common for nominal modification to involve restrictive relative
clauses. One consequence is that combinations of attributive adjectives and
relative clauses often occur, joined in the same way:
(24)shaati cad

white and
arms

dhiiqday
mouthful-the small
and milk-the was
and camel-the gave
'the small mouthful of milk that the camel gave' (lit. 'the small mouthful which
was milk and which the camel gave')
[SHS 71.1]A further consequence is that it is common for relative clauses to be stacked
inside each other, for example:
(27)silsilad
dheer
oo
xirmo
furayaal ah
ka
lulata
chain
long
and bunch
keys
be
from
hang
'a long chain from which hangs a bunch of keys' [MF 82.11-12]Here the relative clause xirmo furayaal ah 'a bunch which is keys' is inside the
relative clause xirmo furayaal ah ka lulata Trom which hangs a bunch of keys',
which is the second dependent element on the head nominal silsilad 'a chain',
the first dependent element being the adjective dhèer 'long'.
8.2Appositive relative clausesAppositive, or non-restrictive, relative clauses are used to add new information
about the head nominal. They only occur on definite heads, typically names and
nouns with suffixed determiners. Since restrictive relatives do not occur on
names, this means that the two types of relative normally only co-occur on
nouns with determiners. Appositives are very similar in form to restrictives
except that the conjunction oo 'and' links the head NP and an appositive relative
clause, for example (where again the head and relative clause are underlined):
(28)Gabaygan
waxaa curiyey

FOC

Ahmed Barre and
Daraawiishtii
Sayid
Maxamed
ka
mid ah
Dervishes-the
Sayid
Mohamed
from one be
'This poem was composed by Sheikh Ismail Ahmed Barre, who was one of
Sayid Mohamed's Dervishes.'
[S2 26.3-4]Since with a single restrictive relative the clause attaches directly to the head,
this oo is a formal marker of appositives. When multiple relative clauses occur
this formal distinction is maintained since in the only context both can occur, on216SOMALInouns with determiners, restrictives are joined by  'and' (8.1) while
appositives continue to employ oo 'and', for example:
(29)aabbáháa
oo
da' áh
oo
άαη welí fásax
qaadán
father-your and age is
and not ever
holiday taken :NEG
'your father, who is aged and who has never taken a holiday'Appositive relative clauses have an important sub-type in which the
appositive is attached to, and often coalesces with, an independent pronoun, for
example:
(30)(31)iságoo
hurdá
he+and
sleeps
'he, who is/was asleep', 'he, being asleep'
iyádoo shaqéynaysá
she+and is: working
'she, who is/was working', 'she, working'These clauses are untensed. Only one form is possible: the present progressive
(4.3.4.7) for dynamic verbs (as in (31) above) and the present general (4.3.4.6)
for stative verbs (as in (30)). There is however no present tense meaning
associated with these forms, which we reflect by using English participle glosses
above.
These untensed appositives function as absolutive adverbial clauses, in the
terminology of Thompson and Longacre (1985); that is they can be used to
imply a range of adverbial relations between a backgrounded predication and the
main predication. These include temporal relations such as 'during' or 'while'
as in (32) below; a circumstantial or contributory factor as in (33); or
simultaneity as in (34):
(32)(33)Hab een baa isagoo lo 'dii

[SHS58.2]In the examples so far the independent pronoun is coreferential with a
participant in the sentence. There is also an impersonal use of this construction,
using the feminine singular pronoun iyáda 'she, it ( ғ ) ' , for example:
(35)lyadoo berigii
hore
uusan jirin
dharku, Soomalidu

sheep:and:goats-their
There being no cloth in early times, the Somalis used to wear the skins of their
sheep and goats.' [4 64. 5-7]Here the head of the clause is the feminine pronoun iyáda (translated above as
'there') even though the noun phrases in the clause, the adverbial bérigii 'the
time' and the subject dhárku 'the cloth' are both masculine. In this example the
appositive carries an implication of reason or cause.
8.3Adverbial clausesSomali employs a range of subordinate clauses to modify sentences adverbially.
In nearly all cases these adverbial clauses are relative clauses on noun phrases of
time, location, manner, etc. In this section we exemplify some major types,
dividing them into semantic categories.
8.3.1 Time
A number of temporal nouns are used to head relative clauses acting as sentence
adverbials. To convey the meaning 'when' nouns such as már N M 'time,
occasion', kól N M 'time, period', and wàa N M 'period, era' are used, with
suffixed definite articles -ka/-ta, -kiil-tii (4.6.1), where appropriate. Some
typical examples are given below:SOMALI218(36)(37)(38)(39)Márkii
