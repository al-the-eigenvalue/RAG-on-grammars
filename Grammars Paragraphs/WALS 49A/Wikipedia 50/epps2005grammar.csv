Hup has a case system that marks both core and oblique arguments of verbs.
Grammatical alignment is strictly nominative-accusative, both morphologically and
syntactically. Subjects in Hup are unmarked, while nouns occurring in a variety of nonsubject roles are object-marked with the suffix -a‡n, provided they conform to certain
semantic restrictions relating to the noun’s placement on the animacy/ definiteness
hierarchy. Oblique arguments (which are not subject to any animacy restrictions) are
marked with the suffix -Vêt in instrumental, comitative, and locative roles, and with what
is apparently an unstressed variant of the Object marker -an (glossed ‘Directional’) in
locative and allative/ablative roles. A noun can take no more than a single case marker at
a time. These patterns are summarized in Table 4.3.

The patterning of core case marking—depending both on the semantic role of the
nominal and on its semantic status (with respect to animacy and definiteness)—isdiscussed in this section. When marking core arguments, the stress on the object marker
-an‡ is quite strong: it is often equal to that on the noun stem itself, and in certain cases it
may be noticeably stronger (especially with pronouns and demonstratives) and could
arguably be considered to be primary stress.
The interaction between the semantic roles of core non-subject participants and
object marking is considered in §4.3.1.1, and the phenomenon of differential object
marking (reflecting animacy and definiteness) is addressed in §4.3.1.2.","[240, 241, 242]"
"3616. The noun phrase: modification and definiteness
This chapter deals with issues relating to the noun phrase and its behavior within
the clause, with a particular focus on modification and definiteness. While chapter 5
dealt with the compound noun, an NP composed of two (or more) associated members of
the open class of nouns, this chapter examines the closed classes of nominal modifiers—
demonstratives, quantifiers, and adjectives—and their roles within the NP. In addition, it
addresses the ability of members of closed word classes to act as nominal heads in their
own right, occurring in lieu of a noun or noun phrase as the argument of a verb. A few
additional non-nominal functions (adverbial, determiner, etc.) of these closed word
classes (specifically interrogative pronouns and demonstratives) are briefly considered
here as well. In the final section of this chapter, I also briefly introduce NP coordination.
Locative postpositions, which typically combine with a noun to form an adverbial phrase
within the clause, are not discussed here but in §10.2.3.
A basic phrase structure template for the NP (in which the noun stem N may be
either compound or simple) is provided here. The order of the constituents is fairly rigid
within the NP itself; when numerals, demonstratives, or possessors follow the noun, they
are probably best interpreted as appositional NPs in their own right, or even as predicate
nominals.
NP Æ (Dem—POSS PN—Numeral) N (Adj)3626.1. Pronouns
While the form of the Hup personal pronouns and their inflected variants are covered in
§4.1.2 (and §5.2), the present discussion deals briefly with their syntax—that is, their
ability to represent NPs in the clause. A discussion of the differences in clausal
constituent order between pronouns and full NPs relative to the verb is given in §17.3.1.
The subject pronouns are here re-summarized in Table 6.1. As can be seen in the
more detailed paradigm given in Table 4.1, §4.1.2, Hup pronouns—like nouns in
general—take basic inflectional and derivational forms relating to case, number, and
possession, as well as various bound focus and discourse-marking forms (chapter 7).
With the exception of suppletive forms (formed via phonological reduction) for the first
person singular object (/a‡n) and possessive (nˆ‡) pronouns, inflected pronouns are
essentially regular.","[377, 378, 379]"
"90517.3.1. Constituent order in the declarative clause
Constituent order in Hup is relatively free, but the formally least-marked pattern is clearly
verb-final. Defining the order of nominal arguments in the transitive clause is more
difficult, but the ‘basic’ constituent order can arguably be identified as AOV. The actual
order of all constituents appears to be determined primarily by pragmatics, with the most
important parameter being the fronting of new information. Other relevant factors that
correlate with word order are verbal tense and aspect, and the identity of nominal
constituents as pronouns or full lexical nouns. Both context and the existence of
morphological core case-marking (see §4.3.1), which corresponds to a consistently
nominative-accusative alignment system, help to disambiguate syntactic arguments.
The dropping of arguments is common in Hup when they can be recovered from
the discourse context; this is particularly true for objects (example 1). Subject dropping
also occurs (example 2), but is less frequent. In general, Hup speakers seem to prefer
clauses with only one full nominal (i.e. non-pronominal) argument, and will sometimes
even repeat the clause, dropping an argument each time, in order to conform to this
(example 3). In providing information in response to a question or related solicitation
from an interlocutor, an utterance may consist of only a verb (plus inflection), or only a
noun or adjective, but in most other discourse contexts a predicate with at least one
nominal argument (usually the subject) is the norm.","[921, 922]"
"4.4.1. Differential plural marking (plurality split) and animacy
Plural marking in Hup conforms to an animacy heirarchy, and follows essentially the
same parameters as does differential object marking. This accounts for the fact that
object marking and number marking pattern together, as discussed in §4.3.1.2 above; that
is, if an entity is conceptually distinctive enough to be number-marked, then it should
also be case-marked.
Smith-Stark (1974) uses the term ‘plurality split’ to describe the phenomenon of
differential plural marking, and observes that “plurality splits a language in that it is a
significant opposition for certain categories but irrelevant for others” (Smith-Stark 1974:
657). Plurality splits are almost always closely linked to animacy. They occur in many
of the world’s languages (Corbett 2000: 55), and are reported as common in North
America (cf. Mithun 1988: 212).
In Hup, nouns with inanimate referents are generally unmarked for number,
although—unlike the restrictions governing differential object marking—number
marking on inanimates is possible. When counting inanimates, the numeral alone usually
suffices to indicate plurality (e.g. ka/ap mç‡y [two house] ‘two houses’); classifiers are
also used in certain cases (see §4.4.3). Nouns referring to animals are found both with254and without number marking, whereas it is required for humans. While languages
with split plurality systems have many options in arranging their systems of differential
number marking, languages like Comanche and Kannada (Corbett 2000: 70) exhibit
patterns very much like that found in Hup.","[270, 271]"
"21.1. Linguistic profile of Hup
Hup grammar exhibits a combination of features that it shares with its Nadahup (Maku)
sister languages, and a number of language-specific innovations, many of which are due
to contact with eastern Tukanoan languages, principally Tukano.
In its phonology, Hup has nine contrastive vowels and twenty-one contrastive
consonants, including a series of eight glottalized consonants. Nasalization in Hup is a
morpheme-level prosody, and the language has a word-accent (restricted tone) system
made up of two contrastive tones (rising and high). There is a strong tendency toward
isomorphism of the morpheme and the syllable.
Hup’s nominal morphology is considerably more isolating than its verbal
morphology, which tends toward polysynthesis and can be relatively complex. Hup
morphology involves both compounding (of as many as five verb stems) and the
association of multiple bound formatives in a series of slots. It is relatively agglutinative
with very little fusion, and bound formatives are predominantly suffixing or otherwise
post-stem.
Hup has nominative-accusative alignment and employs morphological case
marking. In general, it favors dependent marking (realized mainly as nominal case
marking and possession marked on the possessor). Hup grammar shows sensitivity to an
animacy hierarchy and particularly to humanness; this is particularly evident in its
systems of differential object case marking and differential or ‘split’ plural/collective
marking, which reflect the animacy of the referent. Such differential grammatical
marking is a feature of the languages of the Vaupés region generally.","[18, 19]"

(P.F.125)F. Plural nouns
Object marking is always required when the Plural/collective marker =d’´h is present,
regardless of the animacy or definiteness of the noun. Typologically, this appears at first
glance to be a peculiar twist on differential object marking. However, it in fact makes
sense in light of the fact that number marking in Hup involves essentially the same
semantic parameters as does differential object marking, conforming to an
animacy/definiteness hierarchy (see §4.4.1 below). Moreover, Hup is not alone among
languages in displaying an interaction of plural with case marking. For example, animate
nouns in Russian have a different way of forming the accusative case in the plural, as do
male human nouns in Polish (cf. Comrie 1981: 132)—which may reflect an interaction
between differential object marking and an animacy-based plurality ‘split’ like that found
in Hup.
The combination of Plural marker + Object marker in Hup is usually realized as
the fused form =n’a‡n, although the unreduced form =d’´h-a‡n is heard occasionally and is
typical of exaggeratedly slow speech.58 This unreduced form is also always found with
plural demonstratives (see Table 4.2), and corresponds to their unique stress pattern (i.e.
unstressed stem and stressed plural marker, the opposite of the normal stress pattern).
The order of the Plural and Object markers in this form is important; compare the distinct
58Note that the fusion results in a phonologically monomorpheme-like form which is fully nasalized, in
keeping with nasality’s role as a morpheme-level prosody in Hup generally (see §2.3.1).","[253, 254]"
"4.3.1.2. Differential object marking
With the exception of recipients/ beneficiaries of ditransitive constructions, object
marking crucially depends on the semantics of the nominal. In general, object marking is230obligatory for human nouns, pronouns, and demonstratives, optional for animals, and
ungrammatical for inanimates.
It is relatively common cross-linguistically for object marking to be sensitive to
animacy, specificness, and even topicality (cf. Silverstein 1976, Croft 1990: 112, Blake
2001: 119-20). This phenomenon, by which some objects are marked and others are not,
depending on their semantic features, has been termed ‘differential object marking’
(Aissen 2003, Bossong 1998; cf. Zuñiga 2004). Aissen (2003: 437) discusses two
dimensions along which prominence of objects can be assessed for the purposes of
object-marking: animacy and definiteness. With respect to animacy, she posits a crosslinguistically general ranking to be the following: Human > Animate > Inanimate, and
with respect to definiteness, the following: Personal pronoun > Proper name > Definite
NP > Indefinite specific NP > Non-specific NP. The higher an entity falls on these
hierarchies, the more cross-linguistically likely it is to be overtly object-marked.
Examples of other differential object-marking languages include Hindi, in which nouns
are marked only when the referent is both specific and animate (Blake 2001: 120);
Sinhalese, where optional object marking is limited to animate-referring objects; and
Hebrew, where object marking is obligatory but limited to definite objects (Aissen 2003:
436).
Aissen (2003) characterizes the degree to which differential object marking
extends across the class of nouns in different languages as being determined by the
tension between two factors, economy and iconicity. Economy pushes the language to
avoid unnecessary additional morphological material, whereas iconicity fosters the use of
morphological complexity to facilitate comprehension. In a slightly different231interpretation of differential object marking, Hopper and Thompson (1980) consider
the presence of object marking in such languages to register a high degree of Transitivity
in the clause, specifically vis-à-vis the degree of individuation of the nominal entity.
In Hup, differential object marking corresponds closely to the animacy and
definiteness hierarchies. When examined in more fine-grained detail, certain
idiosyncrasies in this pattern only serve to reinforce the conclusion that the phenomenon
has to do with the individuation of entities, as the examples and discussion below
illustrate.
Despite the fact that both subjects and some objects are unmarked and that
constituent order is fairly free in Hup (see §17.3.1), ambiguity is easily avoided. Given
that differential object marking reflects the fact that humans are more prototypical agents,
whereas inanimate objects are more prototypical patients, any potential ambiguity
between agents and patients in Hup discourse is mostly limited to cases of interaction
between animals. When such cases do come up, context and the optional application of
object marking are the primary means of differentiating agents from patients, but if no
other clues are available speakers interpret the clause according to SO constituent order
(see §17.3.1).","[246, 247, 248]"
"2144. The noun and nominal morphology
The noun stem in Hup is identified as the minimal nominal word, which in most
cases is monomorphemic. As discussed in §3.1.1, the defining features of the noun
include its ability to occur as a bare stem lacking a Boundary Suffix (unlike verbs, which
usually require inflection), its functioning as an argument of a predicate or as an
attributive modifier of another noun, and its bearing of lexical (contrastive) tone. Unlike
verbs and adjectives, nouns can in general be possessed, and can be negated with the
existence negator pãÙ (see §16.2).
In this chapter, I present the simple noun stem and the categories of nominal
morphology that are most basic to it, case and number. I also offer a brief discussion of
the lexical phenomenon of reduplication in nouns, and summarize the processes of
nominal derivation. Processes of nominal compounding are treated in chapter 5, and
multi-word noun phrases are covered in chapter 6.","[230, 231]"
"54810.2. Adverbs and adverbials
Adverbial expressions in Hup function as modifiers of the verb phrase, or in a few cases,
of other adjectives (note that adjectives are more often modified by bound emphasis and
intensifier morphemes; see §15.1-2). There is no distinct word class of adverbs; many
adverbial expressions are simply adjectives used in an adverbial role, but nouns, verbs,
and entire clauses can also function as modifiers of a verb phrase, as can ideophones
(§15.7). This section focuses on simple adverbial expressions in Hup, including the
clause-initial adverbial element hi‚ê, as well as Hup’s strategies for expressing
comparison—which generally rely on adverbials to indicate the standard of comparison.
The variety of strategies that are used for deriving adverbial expressions from full clauses
are discussed in §18.2.4.1 and §18.2.6.
Adverbial expressions in Hup are very frequently marked with the enclitic =yˆ/.
This form is nearly ubiquitous in the language, and has a number of functions which
appear to be synchronically quite distinct—in addition to its role with adverbials, it
appears as a verbal Telic suffix (§12.6), and as a marker of contrastive focus on nominal
arguments (§7.1.2).119 On adverbials, =yˆ/ plays a marginally derivational role
(extending to adverbial clauses; see §18.2.6.1). In some adverbial expressions, =yˆ/ is
obligatory and appears to have the primary function of marking the phrase as adverbial,
especially where its syntactic identity and function might be otherwise in doubt because119The historical and/or functional relationship (or even whether one actually exists) between these
different manifestations of yˆ/ is not yet understood. Even the exact factors governing its use with
adverbials are not at this point entirely clear.","[564, 565]"

hˆ¤dAs can be seen in Table 6.1, a number distinction (singular/ plural) is lexically encoded in
pronouns. Although gender is not encoded, it can be specified if necessary; in such cases
the pronoun has a determiner-like function: hˆ¤d /ãêy=d’´h (3pl FEM=PL) ‘those women’.
The singular and plural forms of the ‘Intangible’ demonstrative (see §6.2 below)
are common variants of the basic third person pronouns (and can appear as such in any363grammatical role: subject, object, or oblique).81 They are particularly preferred in
clause-final (post-verbal) position in subject function, where they require the Declarative
marker (like all post-verbal subjects; see §17.3.1). Thus post-verbally one typically finds
the Intangible forms yúw-úh and yˆ-d’´‡h-´¤h, rather than tˆ¤h-ˆ¤h and hˆ¤d-ˆ¤h (example 1).

When they precede the verb in the clause, subject pronouns in Hup are typically
immediately preposed to the verb. They appear to be developing a marginally
procliticized status: in this position, they are unstressed, and in the Umari Norte dialect
the third person singular pronoun (the most frequent in narrative) is phonologically
dependent on its verbal host in some contexts (undergoing loss of final [h] and
assimilating the vowel of the verb stem), as example (2) illustrates. This process may
represent the incipient development of cross-referencing prefixes in the verb.

(RA.MJ.58)
As in most languages, Hup pronouns (including their possessive variants, as in
example 3) are deictic forms that occur as arguments of predicates, in lieu of a noun
phrase; they refer anaphorically to an entity that would otherwise be indicated by a full
NP, or else refer deictically to the physical context.
(3)tˆh=po‡gtˆnˆ‡h-ˆ¤h3sg=big3sg.POSS-DECL‘The big one is his.’ (EL)
81Such double-duty of a demonstrative form is quite common cross-linguistically; Diessel (1999: 119)
observes that third person pronouns often derive historically from pronominal demonstratives.","[379, 380]"
"5.1.4. Nominal compounds involving adjectives: attributive uses of aspect
Certain complex nominal expressions in Hup are formed from the combination of a noun
and an adjective. This role of adjectives is distinct from their typical use as productive
modifiers in noun phrases (see §6.6), in that they do not simply modify a nominal head
within the noun phrase, but themselves are an intrinsic component of a complex nominal
head, that in most cases can itself be modified. The adjectives in this distinct role are
morphologically marked, setting them apart from the more conventional modifiers. It is a
peculiar feature of Hup grammar that there is a formal overlap between the
morphological means for marking these compound-internal attributives, and the marking
of aspect (primarily on verbs) elsewhere in the language.
Hup has two types of these compounds or complex nominals, which both form
very small, closed sets; the productivity of these strategies appears to be extremely
limited. In one, the adjective follows the noun (the typical order for adjective modifiers288and nouns in Hup), and the adjective is marked as a compound-internal attributive by
reduplication. In the other, the adjective precedes the noun, and is marked by the suffix
-Vyê , which appears elsewhere as a Boundary Suffix on verbs and marks Dynamic aspect
within a declarative clause.
A near-comprehensive list (in my corpus) of the nominal compounds involving
reduplication is given below (24-25). Elsewhere in Hup, reduplication appears semiproductively in Hup verbs (see §12.9.3) and in Hup nouns (see §4.5), and relates to
iterative aspect; its use in compounds, however, appears to be completely unrelated to
this aspectual function. In these noun-adjective compounds, the reduplication signals that
the adjective is involved in a nominal unit with its own specific semantics, rather than
simply modifying a noun; for example, the reduplicated form cob popo‡g ‘thumb’ can be
contrasted with the modified noun cob po‡g ‘big finger’. Primary stress in reduplicated
compounds is on the N2, as expected for lexically specific compound forms.","[304, 305]"
"367Question words are always clause-initial, and their use generally requires a
clause-final verb taking the interrogative marker -V/ (see §17.4 for a full discussion of
interrogative clauses and their syntax). These forms also occur in non-interrogative
clauses as indefinite pronouns (§6.4 below).
Examples (8-10) illustrate the use of interrogative /u‡y ‘who’. In (8-9), it stands in
for a noun phrase, as subject and inflected object; in (10), it occurs in combination with a
bound human noun in a compound construction, as a type of modifier or determiner.
Note that—like the lexically singular personal pronouns—/u‡y cannot inflect for number,
but does take the Associative plural form -and’´h (see §4.4.6). The form /u‡y has one
additional use, beyond its function as an interrogative pronoun; it occurs as an enclitic in
constructions meaning ‘one from/associated with’ (see §7.5 below).","[383, 384]"
"3.1.4. Other word classes
Hup has several additional word classes, which play a relatively minor role in the
grammar compared to the major classes of nouns, verbs, and adjectives. Small closed
classes of words that can occur as heads or modifiers in noun phrases are pronouns,
demonstratives, interrogative pronouns, and numerals (which can all be considered
subsets of the noun class more generally; see chapter 6). Locative and temporal
postpositions also form a closed class (itself made up of two sub-classes), whose
elements occur either within noun phrases or independently as adverbs (§10.2.3).
Interjections and ideophones form a (potentially open) class of phonologically and160morphosyntactically idiosyncratic words that are for the most part never modified or
associated with formatives at all; these are discussed along with sentence-level affectmarking strategies (which mostly involve formatives) in chapter 15. Finally, h´‡/ ‘yes, all
right’ and /am ya/ápa/ ‘I don’t know’ make up a small closed class of proclauses.","[176, 177]"

4.3.4. Oblique case -Vêt
A variety of non-core participants in the clause are marked with the catch-all oblique case
form -Vêt. The Oblique marker is always required where applicable; unlike the Object
marker, its presence is not dependent on the animacy, definiteness, or number
specification of the noun. Nonetheless, the interpretation of the semantic role of the
oblique-marked referent is necessarily somewhat dependent on the parameter of animacy.",[262]
"4.6.2. Derivational uses of bound nouns
The addition of a bound (usually a classifying) noun to a verb stem often serves a
nominalizing function, as discussed in more detail in §5.6. This produces either an277instrument nominalization (‘thing for doing V’), as in (174a), or an object
nominalization (‘thing that does V’), as in (174b). The default classifying noun teg ‘tree,
stick, thing in general’ is the most common of the bound forms found in these
constructions. It is not altogether clear to what extent the addition of a bound noun to a
verb stem actually derives a noun, however, since (via the strategy described above) a
bare verb stem can itself act as a nominalization.(174) a)b)hˆ‡/=teg

Subordinated clauses, formed by the addition of Dependent marker -Vp or the
Plural/collective marker =d’´h, function as nominalizations, as discussed in §18.2.3-4.
Addition of the bound preform tˆh= to adjective modifiers also produces a
nominalization, as discussed in §6.6. Finally, as covered in §18.2.5, the form -n’ˆ‡h
follows verb stems and nominalizes entire clauses, which usually appear as complements
(example 175).

classification
Hup has several strategies for combining full nouns, pronouns, or nominal
elements into complex or compound nouns (i.e. noun combinations that act as phrasal
constituents). Syntactically, all involve the juxtaposition of two or more nominal
components, and these combinations serve a range of semantic functions. The slot
sequence for the Hup complex noun is the following:
(Possessor [+Alienable possession marker]) [N1...[N1 N2]]
On the most basic, productive level, we find simple noun compounding, which
can be used to express several distinct relationships between the associated entities. The
expression of alienable possession likewise involves the combination of nouns in an NP,
but in this case the possessor is crucially marked with an additional possessive
morpheme. Hup also has a heterogeneous set of obligatorily bound and/or inalienably
possessed nouns, which must occur in a compound construction, preceded by some other
nominal element. Finally, a subset of these bound nouns occur in combination with other
nouns and serve a primarily classificatory function, by which they categorize the noun
they occur with on the basis of some abstract semantic component.
In Hup, the phenomena of compounding, possession, and noun classification are
all functionally closely related. I therefore consider them together in this chapter, while
other word classes (adjectives, demonstratives, etc.) that occur as modifiers with nouns
and form NPs are considered in chapter 6. Below, I discuss each of the three nominal
construction types in turn, and also address clausal alternatives in the expression of279possession. Finally, I consider the classificatory function of certain bound nouns in
terms of an incipient system of noun classification.","[293, 294, 295, 296]"
"335For most bound nouns (though with the exception of human nouns), negative
existence expressions also render the singular unbound form grammatical (and obligatory
in the case of kin terms), as in (142-43).

sleep-TEL-DYNM‘The little fatherless ones fell asleep.’ (I.M.3)5.6. Bound nouns and semantic extension: noun ‘classification’
As we have seen, obligatorily bound nouns relating to plant parts, eggs, and other entities
tend to occur in paradigmatic sets, and individuate a referent out of a mass of potential
referents. As such, particularly in the case of plant parts, the bound construction typically
serves a classifying function—types of leaves, types of wood, types of feathers, etc. The
bound N1 and N2 correspond either to a whole and its parts, or to two entities in a
possessor-possessed or otherwise inherently associated relationship.
In other cases, the same bound construction, with the same set of bound nouns—
most relating to plant parts—does not indicate a possessor-possessed or whole-part
relationship between two entitities, but instead serves merely to relate a property or other
identifying feature to an entity (i.e. the third type of relationship that is typically encoded
in the more general compound construction; §5.1). The examples of this subtype of
bound noun construction all involve some level of semantic extension (which again is a336typical property of noun compounds generally; see §5.1.1), usually of the head noun
(N2).
These extended bound constructions can be characterized according to two types
of extension: (a) extension involving the semantic type of the construction as a whole
(from whole-part to property-entity) and (b) extension involving the N2 (from a literal
part of a plant to an entity with some abstract semantic feature characteristic of that plant
part). Like the non-extended plant-part compounds, these constructions also have to do
with the classification of types of entities—but according to a distinct classification
strategy, resembling that found in noun classification systems in other languages.
As Grinevald (2000: 54) has observed, a functional-typological perspective allows
us to recognize the various grammatical systems encountered in the world’s languages,
such as noun classification, “as more or less prototypical, and at various stages of
development and disintegration”. Accordingly, the following discussion will consider the
arguments for characterizing the extended bound constructions in Hup as an incipient
system of nominal classification, and as an example of how a noun classification system
may arise in a language (see also Epps, to appear-b). For reasons that will become clear,
I will examine names for native objects and for culturally foreign objects separately.","[351, 352, 353]"

In some cases, the number marker does not indicate a plural number of referents
of the noun with which it occurs, but rather a group of animate (usually human) entitities
that are associated with the noun. As such, it serves a primarily collective function. This
function is illustrated in example (114), which relates to the group of stars,
mythologically embodied by a group of young men, that make up the Pleiades (‘StarHollow’) constellation.

season.’ (H.txt.48)
This collective function of the number marker is also manifested when it occurs with
(nominalized) verb roots, such as/ˆ¤d=d’´h (speak=PL) ‘those who speak the same
language’.
It should also be noted here that while almost all generic nouns referring to
humans are obligatorily bound (usually preceded by the default 3sg pronoun tˆh=), they
(like most other bound nouns) may appear unbound in plural form. For example, the
form tã/ãêy ‘woman (sg)’ (a reduced form of tˆh=/ãêy, involving the bound noun =/ãêy)
can appear as /ãêy=d’´h in the plural, as in example (115). The explanation for this258phenomenon lies in the individuating function of the bound construction, as discussed
in §5.5; this is essentially incompatible with generic semantics.

Number marking is common on nouns referring to animals, as in examples (116-18), but
it may be absent (examples 119-20). In general, an animal-referring noun that is
conceptually plural but lacks number marking is judged grammatical by speakers,
whereas most human nouns in this context are not. In discourse, the presence or absence
of number marking on animal nouns patterns according to specificity; more specific
references to animals are usually marked, whereas more generic references are not—this
is especially typical for game animals, as in (119-120). This is consistent with the pattern
of differential object marking on animal nouns (§4.3.1.2), as well as with the absence of
number marking on certain generic human nouns, as in examples (109-110) above.

A referent may be inherently non-specific in a negative clause, and in this case number

negative clause in (122), which makes reference to a specific bunch of fish, and is
therefore marked for number.

Certain nouns referring to types of insects that typically occur in large swarms are
essentially mass nouns. These may occur in a bound construction with the singulative
bound noun =/ãêw ‘swarming insect’, or with the Plural marker, or even with both, as
illustrated in (123).

Although number marking is not ungrammatical on countable nouns with inanimate
referents (unlike object marking), these nouns are almost always formally unmarked for
number in discourse, as illustrated in (124-29). This is the case regardless of whether or
not number is otherwise specified with a numeral or other quantifier. Like non-specific
humans and animals, inanimate entities are typically of relatively low conceptual
salience, and differentiation for number is thus apparently of low importance.

Note, moreover, that even when their referents are non-singular, inanimate entities
unmarked for number are typically referred back to with a singular pronoun, as in261(130)—unlike non-specific unmarked human nouns like ‘people’ in example (110)
above, which take a plural co-referential pronoun.

As nominal heads referring to non-singular entities, demonstratives occur as the
lexicalized free-pronoun forms nˆ-d’´‡h ‘these’, n’i-d’´‡h ‘those (distal)’, and yˆ-d’´‡h
‘those (intangible)’ (see Table 4.2 in §4.1.2 above), as in examples (131-32). Note that
the lexicalized stress pattern of these forms results in stress falling on the Plural marker,
whereas =d’´h is always unstressed elsewhere in Hup. The Plural marker can also occur
with various other derived demonstrative forms, such as that in (133). It is important to
note that the combination of a bound demonstrative morpheme with the Plural marker
results in a nominalization; in other words, =d’´h has a nominalizing effect on these
forms.

(133) yá/a‡p=d’´h=yˆ¤/
that.ITG.QUANT=PL=TEL‘That’s all of them (her siblings).’ (D.int.112)262Hup’s animate/ inanimate distinction in number marking applies to adnominal
demonstratives. When occurring within an NP, the (DEM + d’´h) forms above are usually
restricted to animate referents, and can only modify an inanimate referent when the
inanimate-referring noun is explicitly number-marked with =d’´h (which, as we have
seen, is almost never the case in natural discourse). For inanimate referents,
corresponding fused forms built on the nominalizer -n’ˆ‡h (see §4.6.3 below and §18.2.5)
are used. These (DEM + n’ˆh) forms are realized as nˆ-n’ˆ‡h ‘these’, n’i-n’ˆ‡h ‘those (DST)’,
and yˆ‚-n’ˆ‡h ‘those (ITG)’, and are never used for animate referents. For a countable
inanimate noun like ‘fruit’, the -n’ˆ‡h demonstrative form requires a plural interpretation;
thus nˆ-n’ˆ‡h=tat means ‘these fruits’, whereas núp=tat means ‘this fruit’ (compare nˆd’´‡h dó/=d’´h ‘these children’). For a mass noun, the demonstrative may be either
inanimate plural or singular; e.g. nˆ-n’ˆ‡h j’ˆ‡k; núp j’ˆ‡k ‘this smoke’.
Numerals (other than ‘one’), like demonstratives, also require the Plural marker
when acting as nominal heads, i.e. when they stand for an explicitly plural (usually
animate) referent, as in examples (134-36). Also as in the case of demonstratives, Plural
=d’´h has a nominalizing function here, and may take the place of a head noun. This is
supported by the fact that numerals representing inanimate referents are usually
accompanied by a bound or classifying noun (see §4.4.3 below, especially example 153,
ko/ap=te‡g ‘two [helicopters]’), whereas adnominal numerals need not, but may, take=d’´h (example 137). Numerals themselves are discussed in detail §6.5.1, while their263use as adnominals within the plural noun phrase is covered in §4.4.4 below.

The Plural marker’s collective function is especially clear when it follows the
numeral ‘one’ in reference to a single set of countable entities, as in (139-41).

(142) /ayup mú(*=d’´h) kç¤w-ç¤h
onemound (*PL)hot.pepper-DECL‘One pile of hot peppers’ (EL)
The use of the Plural marker with pronouns also illustrates its collective function.
Although the first, second, and third person plural pronouns are already lexically
specified for number, they can nevertheless occur with =d’´h, indicating a well-defined
set or group of individuals, as illustrated in examples (143-45). On the other hand, =d’´h
is ungrammatical with the first, second, and third person singular pronouns.
Corbett (2000: 118) observes that collectives derived from pronouns appear to be
very rare in the world’s languages, but the Hup collective pronoun construction does
seem to be a bona fide collective in Corbett’s sense of a group of items “considered
together as a unit”. As the examples below illustrate, the collective is not spatial so much
as conceptual; it is usually used in reference to an ethnic group, as distinct from a more
contextually defined group of referents (which would be referred to with the simple
pronominal form).

Similarly, =d’´h can occur as a collective marker on the interrogative pronoun hˆ‚n’ˆ‡h
‘what’, in reference to a set (but only the Associative plural -an-d’´h is possible with /u‡y
‘who’):

Inanimate nouns conceived as a mass cannot, in general, receive plural marking at all
(whereas countable inanimate nouns usually do not, but in principle can):
(147) /adócu(*=n’a‡n) /ˆnwQ¤d-Q¤yrice(*=PL.OBJ)eat-DYNM1pl‘We’re eating rice.’ (EL)

An inanimate mass noun can be made countable by specifying a unit; this is
usually done by means of a bound noun (see §5.4), as in the following example:
(149) peyãêw
peyãêw=wˆg
peyãêw=tat‘beans’
‘bean seed’ (=individual bean)
‘bean fruit’ (=bean pod)For a few mass nouns, the plural marker may in fact be grammatical, but only in a
collective-type sense:266(150) pãÙt
pãÙt tˆ¤t
pãÙt=d’´h‘hair’
‘strand of hair’
‘lots of hair’The use of measure terms (which are frequently bound nouns) is required when
mass nouns are modified with numerals, as in examples (151-52).
(151) ko/ap b’ç‡/d’u‡çdeh tˆh /´g-yˆ¤/-ay-áh,twotimbówater 3sg drink-TEL-INCH-DECL twocuiako/ap b’ç‡/

ya/áp=yˆ/t ˆhnç¤/-ç¤hthat.much=TEL3sggive-DECLshe gave all this.’ (P.txt.93)
This use of measure terms has a formal parallel in the common (though not obligatory)
use of noun classifiers or other bound nouns when numerals modify countable inanimate
nouns, as in examples (153-54). This supports the notion that nouns unmarked for
number in Hup are conceptually akin to mass nouns; in the same way, it suggests that the
function of the bound construction—and more specifically, the noun classifiers—is one
of individuation, closely linked to that of measure terms (see §5.5-6).64

(154) ka/ap=te‡g!
two=THING‘Two of them!’ (helicopters: pˆpˆh=teg) (OS)
Also compare the use of the ‘singulative’ bound noun =/ãêw ‘swarming insect’ (§4.4.1.B above) with
mass-like insect nouns, and the obligatory participation of human nouns in the bound construction (§5.4.2
and §5.5).","[273, 274, 275, 276, 277, 278, 279, 280, 281, 282, 283]"

(69)pán=w´d
sloth=full.of‘Many Sloths’ (i.e. one who encounters many sloths); ‘Lord of Sloths’
(personal name)
The various uses of =w´d can probably be explained via the semantic and
pragmatic links between old age, the social status accompanying it, and the large quantity
of years, children, hunting-and-gathering experience, and the like that also are associated
with it. While grammaticalized markers of respect, or honorifics, are not uncommon in
the languages of the world, they are considerably less common in highly egalitarian, nonstratified societies like that of the Hupd’´h. Nevertheless, age is clearly a meaningful
measure of social status in such societies. This is reflected linguistically not only in Hup,
but also in languages such as Tunebo (Colombia) and Guugu-Yimidhirr (Australia; cf.
Foley 1997: 326-28). Example (70) illustrates the co-occurrence and marginal ambiguity
of the ‘respected’ and ‘full of’ manifestations of =w´d:445(70)hç‚Ùp=w´d=mahyúw-úh,cç¤=w´d!fish=full.of/lord=REPthat=DECLrainbow=old/respected‘He’s lord of/ has lots of fish, Old Rainbow Man’ (H.40)7.5. Indefinite Associative /u‡y (‘who’)
The ‘Indefinite Associative’ construction involves the attachment of the interrogative
pronoun /u‡y ‘who’ to a noun N, usually following an intervening Directional/Object case
marker (-Vêt or -a‡n), to indicate ‘a person from N, associated with N’. This use of ‘who’
is probably linked to the more general function of interrogative pronouns to mark
indefinite reference (see §6.4); however, it is more grammaticalized. In the Indefinite
Associative construction, /u‡y is typically pronounced [du‡y] due to assimilation with the
preceding dental stop [t] or [n] of the case marker. Some speakers maintain this
assimilation even in slow speech, and do not even recognize a connection between this
form of /u‡y and the interrogative pronoun.108
The Indefinite Associative construction almost always contains a case marker;
this is usually the Object (or possibly the Directional oblique) form -an (71), but in many
cases the Oblique -Vêt is also acceptable (examples 72-73). There are also a very few
examples of this construction where no case marker is present, as in (74) below (note that
in this environment /u‡y is not pronounced [du‡y]). Finally, the construction is almost
always followed by a bound nominal form; this is usually the masculine, feminine, or
108According to the morphophonological parameters defined for Hup formatives in §3.4, the peripheral
formative /uÙy should be labeled a postpositional ‘particle’, rather than an ‘enclitic’, because it receives446plural enclitic, but may be another bound noun when the referent is inanimate, as in
example (73), which refers to a piece of plastic pipe.

The Indefinite associative construction can also follow a personal pronoun, as in
the expression /ãêh-an-/u‡y=d’´h (also /ãêh-ãêt-/u‡y=d’´h) [1sg-OBJ/OBL-who=PL] ‘my
friends/those who are with me’. It is found with demonstratives (example 75) and with
interrogative pronouns (example 76) as well.","[461, 462, 463]"
"5.5. Making sense of the bound noun construction
Why should such a heterogeneous group of phenomena—kin terms, humans, plant parts,
game animal body parts, and a few other entities—be expressed by a single syntactic
construction type? And why should human body parts not be encoded in the same way?
Taking a step back, we can ask what the bound construction has in common with
the nominal compound construction in general (§5.1). Syntactically, these are clearly
equivalent; both involve a N1 N2 combination in which N2 is the head noun, N1 the
modifier or possessor. I propose that the formal and constructional similarity among all
of these forms in fact reflects a functional unity: all of the Hup compound constructions
have to do with the individuation of the head noun out of the indeterminate mass of
potential referents.
In the case of the noun compounds composed of free lexemes, this individuation
is signaled via a possessive relationship, a whole-part relationship, or qualification by a
certain property; in the case of the bound nouns discussed above, the relationship326between them is likewise that of possessor-possessed or whole-part (or more loosely,
an inherent association between two entities). The set of bound nouns in Hup thus bears
a resemblance to the class of inalienable nouns in the Australian language Mayali; Evans
(1995) describes these as characterized by the existence of some other entity, a ‘whole’ to
which they belong or are associated. In Hup, these relationships between the components
of the compound construction all entail that the N2 or head of the compound is defined
and specified by the N1, or modifier. The functional relationship between this
individuating function and the more general phenomena of definiteness and specification
is illustrated by the use of forms like tˆ¤h=/ãy, tˆ¤h=/i‚h (3sg-FEM ‘that woman’; 3sg-MSC
‘that man’) in examples (96-97) above.
Furthermore, I argue that this individuating function of the bound construction in
Hup applies specifically in the context of human interaction. While Chappell and
McGregor (1995: 8) propose a cross-linguistic characterization of the inalienable
construction as a function of the ‘personal domain’, this is not in itself enough to explain
the patterning of the bound construction in Hup, since human body parts are not included
in the set. Finally (in keeping with Chappell and McGregor 1995), a full account of the
membership of the set of bound nouns in Hup must appeal to the socio-cultural context of
its speakers.
Below, each of the subsets of obligatorily bound nouns is considered in turn, visà-vis the proposal that their participation in the bound construction is determined by their
association with another entity, and that this in turn relates to their individuation relative
to a set of potential referents.","[342, 343]"

Finally, Focus -áh occurs in one other context involving a clause-final affect
marker, but here its distribution is somewhat different from the cases described above. In
this construction, rather than marking a focused argument elsewhere in the clause, -áh
always immediately precedes a clause-final nominal argument that is marked as a topic
by the Dependent marker -Vp (cf. §7.1.5) (note -Vp also acts as a clausal subordinator;
see §18.2.4.1). The Focus marker -áh usually falls on the immediately preceding
predicate of the clause, and the resulting construction as a whole is relatively emphatic
(see §7.1.5). Note that in a more neutral affirmation, subject-final constituent order in the
clause typically requires the Declarative marker -Vêh instead of the Dependent marker,
and the preceding predicate has no special marking.

The so-called ‘Filler’ syllable -Vw- is perhaps the most neutral morpheme in Hup, in
terms of carrying a particular semantics. It appears in a number of distinct contexts: it
appears to play a role in clause linkage and subordination, as discussed in §18.1.2 and
§18.2.3 (see also below); in other contexts the main role of -Vw- appears to be one of
conveying emphasis, which corresponds to and is perhaps even iconically motivated by
the phonological weight the Filler syllable adds to the word. The connection between
these various uses, and the motivation for the Filler syllable in some of these contexts, is
not yet fully understood; however, certain other mechanisms used in signaling clausal
linkage—most notably the Dependent marker -Vp (see §7.1.5 and §18.2.4)—are also
used as discourse-markers on main clauses, so this dual-duty is not unique to the Filler
syllable. This section focuses on its use as an emphasis marker in main clauses.
Formally, Filler -Vw- is limited to contexts preceding a vowel-initial Boundary
Suffix, and is the only case in Hup of a vowel-initial form that is not itself a Boundary
Suffix. Its function is in many cases largely determined by that of the vowel-initial suffix
that follows it. Filler -Vw- tends to occur on a clause-final constituent, but can appear
both clause-internally and clause-finally in a single clause.
Filler -Vw- frequently occurs with clause-final nominal arguments (subjects or
objects), followed by Declarative -Vêh or the Dependent marker suffix -Vp (which here
serves an emphasis-related function), or (particularly in the case of demonstrative
pronouns) by a case-marker (Object -a‡n or Oblique -Vêt). In this context, -Vw—which is
purely optional—functions to place additional emphasis on the participant in question.","[846, 847, 848]"
"568related functions. While the use of locative adpositions to express temporal concepts
is not rare cross-linguistically (e.g. compare English ‘before’, ‘after’), the particularly
salient semantic overlap between spatial, temporal, and conceptual relations is also a
feature of Hup grammar more generally (cf. Appendix I). The semantic extensions of the
locative adpositions are included in the tables below.
The Hup locative postpositions fall into two sets, based primarily on their
morphological properties. The forms in the first set, given in Table 10.1, are relatively
heterogeneous. They are all morphologically frozen forms, although some appear to
contain identifiable inflectional markers that occur elsewhere in the language (such as
Directional/object -an, Locative có/, Sequential -yo/, Telic/adverbial =yˆ/, and Measure
=tQn). Most can also take additional inflectional markers, particularly Directional -an
and Locative có/, and the Diminutive intensifier =mQh can follow the locative
postposition to emphasize closeness in the spatial relationship; e.g. ‘just above’, ‘just
below’, etc. (see §15.1.4). The postpositions in this set are akin to adjective modifiers or
bound nouns, in that they follow nouns in noun phrases, and case marking and other
inflection occurs NP-finally. The locative NP as a whole typically functions adverbially.
Most of these postpositions must be preceded by a noun, and cannot appear ‘bare’ (i.e.
with no object at all), as adverbs; minimally, they take the default nominal form tˆh= (as
do adjectives and bound nouns).","[584, 585]"

There is some evidence that the instrumental function is in some sense more basic
to Oblique -Vêt than is the locative function. In cases where the interpretation of the
noun’s semantic role is potentially ambiguous between instrumental and locative, -Vêt is250preferred for the instrumental role, and Directional -an for the locative, as in example
(94a) and (b). That this preference only surfaces in cases of ambiguity is illustrated by
the related but locative -Vêt-marked example in (95).","[266, 267]"
"246The semantic roles indicated by this form include locative (inanimates), instrumental
(inanimates), and comitative (animates);62 such an overlap of semantic roles and
grammatical relations is not particularly uncommon (cf. Blake 2001: 63).
In certain cases (see discussion in §18.2.6.2), the ‘Filler’ form can intervene
between the noun stem and the Oblique marker (although elsewhere this is usually found
only between verb stem and case marker in a relative clause). When the ‘Filler’ form is
present, an optional variant of -Vêt is -ˆ¤t (or, with some speakers, nasal -ˆ‚tê ), as in example
(84) below. The two forms appear to be in free variation in this context.
The different semantic roles indicated by the Oblique case are discussed below.","[262, 263]"

of modifier + noun, in which the modifier is marked by the suffix -Vêy (elsewhere a
Boundary Suffix on verbs and predicate adjectives indicating Dynamicity—i.e. temporal
continuity, usually vis-à-vis the speech moment—in declarative clauses; see §12.2). This
strategy differs from that involving reduplication in several respects. Perhaps most
importantly, this construction bears perhaps a greater resemblance to a relative clause
than to a compound, in that it involves a modifier + subordinating morphology + head
noun (compare the prototypical relative clause: verb + Dependent marker -Vp + head
noun; see §18.2.3.1). Unlike relative clauses, the first element of the construction is not a
verb; however, it is also not invariably an adjective, but in a few cases is a nominal form,
or even an interrogative pronoun, as in (28) below. Finally, some of these complex
nominals are marginally productive in the sense that the same adjective + Vêy can appear
with different head nouns, as is the case of póh-óy ‘high’ in example (26) below. In
keeping with this semi-productivity, stress in these constructions falls on the first
component rather than on the second. However, these forms are semi-lexicalized, and are
not productive in the sense that any adjective can combine freely in this way with any
noun.","[305, 306]"

"15.5. ‘Whatchamacallit’ morpheme hãêy
The function of the ‘whatchamacallit’ form hãêy is to fill the space left by a mental block,
maintaining the flow of speech and the conversational turn of the speaker; it is thereforesomething like English ‘watchamacallit’ and ‘um’. Whatchamacallit hãêy can act as an862interjection (allowing the speaker to hold the floor while searching for words), and it can
also occur in place of a lexical item within the clause (but not a grammaticalized particle
or bound morpheme), typically a noun or verb stem. In this case, hãêy itself takes the
inflectional morphology of the replaced stem. Note that this ability of a single root to
inflect as either a noun or a verb stem is not unique to hãêy (cf. §3.1), but hãêy is extreme
in its flexibility.
The interjection-type use of hãêy is illustrated in (173), where the speaker uses it to
correct himself when he absent-mindedly called someone by the wrong name. Note the
similarity between this use and that of Protestive bá/ for self-correction (§15.3.5) in
example (154) above.

In examples (174-76), Whatchamacallit hãêy fills in for a noun within the clause,
and inflects for case and number just like a normal noun. Interestingly, the ability of hãêy
to take object case and number marking is governed by the animacy of the referent, just
as it is for any normal noun. This suggests that even though the speaker has a mental
block on the word itself, information pertaining to the animacy and number of the
referent is still available.179

"59In indicating morpheme juncture, a hyphen is used to indicate boundaries
between (compounded) verb stems and affixes, while an equals sign marks juncture for
clitics and bound nouns. Particles (defined in §3.4.2.2 as grammatically bound
formatives that are phonologically relatively free) are written as unattached forms (i.e.
separated from their grammatical host by a space), as are most constituents of NPs. In
cases where an internally analyzable form has been relexicalized as essentially
monomorphemic, no juncture is indicated in the transcription, but the semantic
breakdown of the parts is indicated in the gloss line; the general meaning of the full unit
as a whole is given in the translation line.
The examples used in this grammar are drawn from a number of sources. The
majority come from texts of traditional stories, personal narratives, spells, speeches, and
descriptive and hortatory discourse (recorded, transcribed and translated in the field);
these examples are coded with a series of letters and numbers corresponding to the text in
which they occur. A few examples come from songs (coded as (Song)), and others from
spontaneous conversations, coded as (cv.txt); both of these text genres were also recorded
and transcribed in the field. Still other examples come from speech I happened to
overhear or that was addressed to me in the context of daily life (which I checked
afterwards with consultants), glossed (OS) (for ‘Overheard Speech’). Finally, elicited
examples are of two types. Many are statements that were volunteered more or less
spontaneously by a consultant, often in the context of an elicitation setting (i.e. ‘we say X
when…’); these are coded (RU) (for ‘Reported Utterance’). Others are explicit
grammaticality judgments and direct translations, glossed as (EL) (for ‘Elicited’); these
are relied on as little as possible, but sometimes could not be avoided. Almost all of the60examples herein were double-checked with consultants when the grammar was in draft
form.
Additional conventions used in this grammar are the following. I have chosen to
capitalize the grammatical labels applied to individual Hup formatives (e.g. Perfective
aspect, Future tense). This reflects the fact that these labels are all language-specific to
some degree, even when they appeal to categories that are widely attested typologically.
Also, in the comparative sections of the grammar involving the other Nadahup languages
(Yuhup, Dâw, and Nadëb), I have adapted the orthographies of Martins, Ospina, and
Weir to correspond as much as possible to that used with Hup, in order to facilitate
comparison on the part of the reader. In some cases, however, the changes necessarily
reflect my own analysis of phenomena in Hup phonology, and do not always accurately
represent the analyses of these authors. Finally, the orthographic conventions used in this
grammar to write the Hup language are discussed in §2.5.","[75, 76, 77]"

pronouns in argument positions of verbs and adpositions (where they are used in lieu of
nouns or noun phrases and inflect for case, number, and so on just as nouns do), and they370occur together with nouns in noun phrases as determiners (Hup has no
definite/indefinite articles per se). Demonstrative forms can also occur as adverbs
modifying a verb, and as demonstrative ‘identifiers’ in copular and nonverbal clauses.
This discussion focuses on the semantics, morphology, and syntax of the Hup
demonstratives (with the exception of the interrogative particle, which is discussed in
§6.2 above). The Proximal, Distal, Intangible, and Alterative terms are discussed in turn.","[386, 387]"
"3.4. Formative classes and their combination
While roots—the smallest units of syntax—were discussed in §3.1, this section focuses
on formatives. These are morphemes that do not head phrases, govern/ be governed, or
trigger/ undergo agreement. Two general classes of formatives, and several finer
distinctions, can be defined with respect to the structure of the Hup word (i.e.
corresponding to slots in the word template). These are the ‘core’ formatives, which are167made up of prefixes and suffixes (including Inner Suffixes and Boundary Suffixes),
and the ‘peripheral’ formatives, which include clitics and particles. Hup morphology is
almost exclusively suffixing (or otherwise post-stem), a common feature of verb-final
languages.
Definitional morphosyntactic criteria for classifying the Hup formatives include
their distance from the root (i.e. position in the core vs. the periphery of the word,
especially the verb) and the obligatoriness of the formative vis-à-vis the word class of the
host. Important definitional phonological features for classifying formatives include
stress/tone, vowel harmony and other morphophonemic processes, and underlying
syllable structure. In general, the degree of phonological integration of formatives with
their host stem corresponds to their degree of syntactic and semantic integration. There is
some flexibility between the Inner Suffix and the enclitic position, an issue which is
discussed in §3.5 below.
Hup nominal morphology is relatively isolating, whereas its verbal morphology is
quite rich (note that this is largely focused on the marking of tense-aspect-mode and of
discourse-related phenomena such as focus and emphasis, rather than agreement). Both
nouns and verbs can associate with affixes, clitics, and particles, but prefixes are strictly
verbal (with the exception of nominals derived from verbs). Likewise, the distinction
between Inner and Boundary Suffixes only has a distinct reality with regard to verbs; in
the few cases in which formatives identified as verbal Inner Suffixes (based on their
behavior with verbs) associate with nouns, they appear formally indistinguishable from
Boundary Suffixes or enclitics. In fact, most of the core formatives in general (with the
exception of case markers) arguably are primarily verbal forms, although many do occur168with predicate nominals as well and even with nominal arguments. When they
associate with nominal arguments, these suffixes often have significantly different
functions from when they associate with verbs; for example, many verbal aspect/mode
markers have focus- or emphasis-related functions when occurring in combination with
nouns (see §7.1).
In relation to the semantic and functional categories by which reference grammars
are typically organized (e.g. aspect, tense, mood, etc.), each subset of formatives
(Boundary Suffixes, enclitics, etc.) in Hup is largely heterogeneous; in other words, it is
in many cases impossible to predict the function of a formative based on its form-class,
and vice versa. This organization of this grammar employs a breakdown of grammatical
morphemes by semantics and function (such that formatives relating to aspect, valency,
etc. are grouped together), which is judged more user-friendly, rather than attempting to
organize according to the formal identity of each class of morpheme. The formatives are
treated purely according to their slot-class membership in this chapter alone. However,
there are certain broad generalizations that can be drawn to relate form-class to semantics
and function; these will be discussed in this chapter and also addressed in the relevant
chapters throughout the grammar.
The verbal template is summarized here (see also §8.3); note that the minimal
verb word usually requires a stem and a Boundary Suffix (although the latter is absent in
the imperative and apprehensive moods, and in some cases of clause chaining).","[183, 184, 185]"
"911eat-CNTRFACT-DYNM PRX.CNTR 1sg.OBJ-DECL‘A spirit nearly ate me up!’ (M.NS.68)
As is common in many languages, pronominal subjects in Hup (which tend to be
highly topical) almost always immediately precede the verb in the clause (examples 1415) (resulting in a default OAV order). Because pronominal objects are obligatorily
case-marked, ambiguity in the identity of core syntactic arguments is always avoided
when one argument is a pronoun. Probably as a result of this preference for pronominal
subjects to directly precede the verb, they have acquired some of the characteristics of
proclitics when in this position in the clause (i.e. lack of stress, and a tendency for the
third person singular pronoun tˆh to be phonologically dependent on the verb in the
Umari Norte dialect; see §3.4.2.1 and §6.1).",[928]

There is considerable evidence that these constructions involve the incorporation
of a noun into a verbal construction, and that they form a distinct, probably closed class
vis-à-vis the open, fully productive set of intransitive clauses of the type [noun ni-],
which have the meaning ‘X exists’, ‘X is here’. First, the incorporated [noun + ni-]
compounds form single phonological words: they take a verbal stress pattern (where
stress falls on the final stem and/or inflectional affix), there is no pause phenomena
dividing the noun from the verb, and the incorporated noun lacks distinctive tone
(contrastive tone is characteristic of Hup nouns, but is not usually realized on Hup verbs;
see §2.3.2.2). Second, the idiomatic meanings of some of these constructions supports
their analysis as a set of compounds distinct from intransitive clauses; for example, bab’ni- (sibling-be) ‘be accompanied by; accompany’ may refer specifically to siblings, but
need not; also compare hç-ni- (liver-be) ‘think about something’, etc.
In addition to these factors, incorporating forms differ syntactically from
intransitive clauses with ni-. For example, the incorporated verbs take a nominative
pronoun, whereas non-incorporated nominal constructions can only take a possessivepronoun. This is illustrated in example (127) for cç‚h-ni- ‘dream’ and (128) for wan538ni- ‘knife exists’:(127) a)/ãh cç‚h-ní-íy

which is distinct from the incorporated noun. That the incorporated noun is itself not a
direct object is evidenced by the fact that it cannot be marked for case, despite its number
and animacy, whereas case-marking is obligatory for plural and human direct objects.","[553, 554, 555]"

Joãoold.man-FUT-INCH-DECL‘João will get old’4.2. Nominal morphology
Hup’s nominal morphology is considerably less complex than its verbal morphology.
Nevertheless, a given nominal root can often take multiple formatives, including suffixes
as well as enclitics. In keeping with Hup morphological patterns in general, these always
follow the stem—with the marginal exception of the procliticization of the third person
singular pronoun tˆh to some bound nouns (see §5.4). In general, formatives attach to the223last element of the noun phrase in Hup, rather than to the head noun within the NP,
regardless of how phonologically integrated the bound morpheme is with its host stem.55
A morphological slot sequence for the noun is given here:
STEM—Number[-d’´h]—(Filler[-Vw])—Case[-a‡n, -an, -Vêt]/Dependent marker[-Vp]
—Aspect/Focus—Declarative[-Vêh]
The discussion of nominal morphology in this chapter concentrates on the
inflectional marking of case and number; these forms are considered to be
morphosyntactically maximally ‘basic’ to the noun, since they relate intrinsically to the
identity of the individual nominal referent and to its syntactic role in the clause.
However, the list of formatives that can be associated with nouns is in fact much longer,
and most of these are addressed in chapter 6. In general, the primary function of these
latter forms is one of marking pragmatic focus and other functions related to the larger
focus of the discourse context. In addition, many of them are highly ‘promiscuous’, in
that they are also found on other parts of speech and in a variety of constructions, often
with quite distinct functions for a single form; for example, several occur as aspect
markers on verbs. Still other promiscuous forms can be associated with virtually any part
of speech—which frequently functions as a convenient host in a key position within the
clause—with no substantial difference in semantic contribution; most of these are
discussed in chapter 15 (see also Appendix I).","[239, 240]"

In addition to the focus on a cooperative activity linking participants, use of -nˆ‡N in

highlights the role of some object that is required for the activity (i.e. with which the

~ ‘which would allow him to medicate/enchant the women’ (LG-C.16)
In addition to its use with both singular and plural forms of first and third person
subjects, Cooperative -nˆ‡N may be used with a singular second person subject:(72)760/ám/ç‚h-nˆ‡N2sgsleep-COOP‘You can sleep with it.’ (handing someone a hammock) (EL)
However, the use of the -nˆ‡N verbal marker is ungrammatical with the second person
plural pronoun, creating a gap in the paradigm. The only readily apparent motivation for
this is that the second person plural pronoun nˆ¤N is essentially identical to the
Cooperative suffix. Their incompatibility may be a clue to a diachronic relationship
between these two forms; alternatively, it could possibly be motivated by a desire to
avoid repetitive forms, especially since pronominal nˆ¤N is extremely common in Hup
discourse.
The form nˆN plays another role in Hup grammar, in addition to its use as second
person plural pronoun and verbal suffix. It acts as a verb root relating to a personal
association between human participants, meaning roughly ‘expect someone, await
someone’s arrival’, as in (73):
(73)cãp=/i)h-a‡ntˆh nˆ¤N-ˆptíh !other=MSC-OBJ 3sg expect.somone-DEP EMPH2‘He was expecting a different person!’ (P.DP.84)
It frequently occurs together with the frustrative marker in the expression nˆN-yQ‚êh-Q‚êh
‘hope for, expect someone (in vain)’, typically used in situations where the speaker had
thought someone was coming but was mistaken. People in the village reportedly said
(74) when they were expecting me and heard another boat pass by on the river.","[775, 776, 777]"
"A) Derivation
To the extent that the N1 members of compounds can be considered heads of the noun
phrase, the classifying nouns—in cases where N1 is a verbal stem—can be understood to
have the derivational function of creating an object or instrument nominalization from the
verb stem, as in (173). Such derivational functions are common for noun classifiers in
other languages (see Aikhenvald 2000: 220), especially those of Western Amazonia
(Grinevald and Seifart, forthcoming).

‘hollow for throwing out trash’ = ‘wheelbarrow’
B) Anaphoric reference
One of the most common functions of classifier terms in Hup is that of anaphoric
reference, as in examples (174-76). Classifying nouns can refer anaphorically back to the
full compound (or directly to a physically present object) in constructions where the N1 is
the default/possessor form tˆh=, a demonstrative (174), a numeral (175), or a relative352clause (176). An anaphoric function is a common feature of noun classifiers
generally, especially in Amazonian languages (cf. Derbyshire and Payne 1990: 243).

non-semantically extended use, the plant-part forms and various other bound nouns can

With relative clauses, numerals, and demonstratives, the bound or classifier form
may be interchangeable with a distinct monomorphemic head noun, depending on how
specific the speaker chooses to be, as in (179). However, the slot cannot be filled by a
full compound if a bound form is available. Thus either the lexeme cug’Q‡t ‘leaf, paper,book (generic)’ or the bound form =g’Qt ‘leaf, paper, book’ can follow a relative353clause, but not pˆhˆ¤t=g’Qt ‘banana leaf’ or hˆ‡/=g’Qt ‘notebook’.(179) a)[/ãh kéy-ep]g’ogcak-yˆ¤/-ˆ¤y1sgtiti.monkeyclimb-DYNMsee-DEP‘The titi monkey I saw climbed up.’

Hup classifying terms can arguably serve a marginal agreement-marking function by
virtue of appearing, optionally, on multiple constituents of the clause (as with noun class
marking in Bantu, for example), as in (180). This concord has been identified by
Grinevald (2002) as a hallmark of a true nominal classification system. However, this
agreement-like phenomenon is extremely rare in natural discourse in Hup (being
confined mostly to elicitation contexts), and may be better characterized as apposition of
distinct noun phrases, rather than as marking concord within a single noun phrase.

Typologically, the Hup system is best characterized as an incipient classifier or ‘class
term’ system (cf. DeLancey 1986, Grinevald 2000). It falls near the lexical end of the
Grinevald’s proposed scale of classifier grammaticalization:354
<Lexical------------------------Grammatical>
measure terms
noun classes—gender
class termsThe arguments for considering the Hup system to be incipient are the following.
a) Only a small subset of Hup bound nouns—and even of plant-part terms—are
consistently used in metaphorically extended ways (see the list in 150 above).
b) For the most part, the contexts of semantic extension have to do with newly
introduced cultural items, and the influx of these items is a relatively recent
phenomenon—the majority have become available within the lifetime of adult
speakers. Some bound nouns appear to have been only recently extended in
semantically specific ways, in order to classify a particular variety of new item;
the best example of this is leaf Æ book.
c) The bound classifier nouns have undergone little grammaticalization and
essentially no phonological reduction; they are all recognizable nouns that can act
as heads elsewhere (cf. the incipient classifier systems in some Australian
languages (e.g. Reid 1997, Wilkins 2000, Grinevald 2000: 84).
d) The classifying terms are used for derivation (see §5.7.4.2A), but are used only
minimally for agreement-marking purposes (§5.7.4.2C).
e) The presence of the classifying form is sometimes optional in the NP (see §5.6.4.1
above), and is absent altogether from most nouns in Hup.","[368, 369, 370, 371]"
"5.2. Alienable possession
Like noun compounding, the expression of possession in Hup involves the conjunction of
two nouns into a noun phrase. Most Hup nouns are non-obligatorily or alienably
possessed; that is, they can appear by themselves as complete NPs. When these nouns
are possessed by another entity, an additional morphological marker of the possessive
relationship is required. This is the postpostional particle nˆ‡h (which receives stress and
rising tone); this marker is associated with the possessor (phonologically so in the case of
pronouns), and usually precedes the possessum, as in examples (29-30). (Note that this
form is homonymous with the clausal Negative suffix -nˆ‡h.)(29)292tQ¤=d’´h nˆ‡h,yˆ-d’´‡h nˆ‡hde‡hant.sp=PL POSSthat-PLtˆnˆ‡hg’o‡d-ót,hib’ah-tQ‚h=/i‚h nˆ‡hmç‡yg’o‡d-ót…inside-OBLcreated-son=MSChouseinside-OBLPOSSwater‘The water (saliva) of those ones, those tQ¤ ants.’ (M.70)
(30)mç‡y3sg.POSS housePOSS‘Inside his house, the created one’s house…’ (MD.DT.82)
The possessive pronouns are formed from the fusion of the subject pronoun and
the possessive suffix. These forms are somewhat phonologically reduced (via
simplification of consonant clusters) in the Tat Deh and Barreira dialects, but are almost
fully transparent in the dialect spoken in Umari Norte, with the exception of the 1sg form.
The paradigm for the possessive pronouns is given below in Table 5.1 (restated from
§4.1.2), and examples of their use in text are provided in (31-33).","[308, 309]"

Case marking in Hup is not limited to the individual nominal word, but also occurs on
noun phrases and relative clauses. In these cases, it marks the phrase as a whole, rather
than attaching to phrase-internal nominal heads or other constituents, and occurs phrasefinally—even following nominal enclitics.59 In this section, I provide a short discussion
of the patterning of object marking with demonstrative and adjective NPs (which are
discussed in more detail in §6.3 and §6.6.), and with headless relative clauses (see
§18.2.3)239A. Demonstrative + Noun NPs
Just as object marking is required on all demonstratives acting as nominal heads, NPs
containing a demonstrative also receive obligatory object marking, regardless of their
animacy or number. The case marker usually attaches to the final constituent of the NP,
as in examples (51-54).","[255, 256]"
"397Given their common resemblance, the forms for ‘two’ and ‘three’ seem to be
reconstructable across the Nadahup family, although they have retained semantic
transparency. The ‘fraternal’ form for ‘four’ is perhaps even more intriguing, since it is
common not only to three of the Nadahup languages, but also to the Vaupés region and
beyond: calqued equivalents of ‘has a brother/companion’ for ‘four’ are found in the
Tukanoan languages generally, in Tariana (probably due to diffusion from Tukanoan,
since it is not found in the related language Baniwa; cf. Aikhenvald 2002: 107-8). The
‘fraternal’ term for ‘four’ also occurs in several Witotoan/ Bora languages (Colombia),
including Miraña (Frank Seifart, p.c.), Murui and Mˆnˆca (Huber and Reed 1992: 183);
some also use ‘without a brother’ for ‘three’ (Huber and Reed 1992: 183). Finally, in
Kakua/Nukak ‘two’ is literally ‘brother’, and the same word is contained in the other
even numerals (Huber and Reed 1992: 180-84).
The ‘has a sibling’ strategy is clearly a widespread areal phenomenon, although it
does not appear to be a more generally cross-linguistically common strategy for
representing ‘four’ (cf. studies of numeral etymologies, e.g. Blaz‡ek 1999). It is possible
that the ‘fraternal’ tally system present in Dâw might once have been a more widespread
strategy, later superseded (in some cases) by a base-five system (also probably a tally
system). There may also be a cultural explanation for the equation of ‘four’ with two
pairs of siblings: in the Vaupés region (and beyond it), having and living among one’s
actual and classificatory siblings is culturally extremely important; these are one’s fellow
clan members (and in the case of the Vaupés River Indians, the fellow speakers of one’s
language). Moreover, as Pozzobon (1997: 167) points out, sister-exchange is the ideal398marriage pattern in the region, in part because this allows spouses to return to the
community of one of their parents; thus if a person has an opposite-sex sibling, he/she is
more likely to find a partner. This involves two sets of two; two married pairs of
siblings—four individuals. Thus there is a culturally highly salient reason to associate
the quantity 3 with a ‘failed’ set (‘without a sibling’) and 4 with a full set (‘has a
sibling’).99
Hup and Yuhup closely fit the Vaupés areal profile in having language-specific
lexical forms for 1-3, a calqued form of ‘has a sibling/ is accompanied’ for ‘four’, and
terms based on hands and feet for five and up. Interestingly, the range of numeral
strategies across the family corresponds to their geographical proximity to the Vaupés
region: Nadëb (the most distant) has lexical forms for 1-3; Dâw (peripheral) adds a
minimally lexical ‘fraternal’ system for 4-10; and Hup and Yuhup have these strategies
plus a base-five system for 5-10. The current systems in Hup and Yuhup may represent
historical layers of developing complexity, which are currently reflected in geographical
distribution (across the Nadahup languages) as well as diachronically. I therefore suggest
the following stages of development for the Hup and Yuhup numeral systems:
1) A basic 1-3 system (like that found in Nadëb);
2) Adoption of a minimally productive ‘fraternal’ system (like the one in Dâw);
3) Adoption of a base-five system (probably borrowed from the Tukanoan
languages); this would have stranded ‘four’, giving it a specific quantitative value
to replace the general meaning ‘even number’;
4) Currently: adoption of Portuguese numerals for 6+, resulting in the stranding of
‘five’ as a distinct lexical item, rather than part of a more general system.","[413, 414, 415]"

The form /ap is most commonly encountered in the quantifier/a‡p-yˆ/ ‘every, all’, which
involves the Telic (contrastive focus) marker =yˆ/ (see §7.1.2). This quantifier acts like
an adjective in that it can follow the noun or pronoun that it modifies (as in examples 98100), but it can also occur by itself as a nominal head (example 100). Objects modified
by /a‡pyˆ/ do not take case marking.",[420]

appears strictly as a verbal preform in its manifestation as a valency-decreasing Reflexive
marker. As a Reflexive, hup- indicates generally that the grammatical subject is being
directly acted upon. Interpretations of the constructions in which it occurs can vary; the
use of hup- can result in a standard reflexive reading (i.e. the subject acts on him/herself
directly), a passive (some other participant acts on the subject), or—more marginally—a
reciprocal (coordinated subjects act on each other), depending on the semantics of the
verb and on the general context.
A correlation between passive, reflexive, and reciprocal constructions is not
uncommon cross-linguistically. Shibatani (1985: 826) observes that many languages
exhibit such a correlation, including Spanish, Russian, Quechua, and Yavapai, and he
offers the explanation that this similarity “arises largely from a semantic property of these
constructions: in all of them, surface subjects are affected” (1985: 840). In other words,
these constructions all involve a reduction in the Transitivity of the clause (in the sense of579Hopper and Thompson 1980), in that the grammatical subject is in some way also a
semantic patient.
Formally, the Reflexive form hup- displays the properties typical of Hup
preforms: it is unstressed, is not separated from its verbal host by pause phenomena, and
no other constituents can come between it and the verb (with the exception of an object of
a ditransitive verb; see below). Requirements for the use of Reflexive hup- include the
stipulation that it can occur only with a transitive or ditransitive verb; it is ungrammatical
with an intransitive verb, as illustrated in example (6a). In any case where the form hup
does occur in a clause with a subject nominal and an intransitive verb, it can only be
interpreted as a Reflexive intensifier, encliticized to the noun, as in (6b); it cannot act as
an impersonal subject, since a subject is already present.","[595, 596]"

them from most bound nouns) is their ability to occur in an explicitly nominalized form
in association with other nouns. This results in a noun phrase composed of [N tˆh=Adj].
Grammatically, this can be considered as two appositional NPs, since both elements can
take case and number marking separately; by contrast, in an NP formed from [N Adj]
without intervening tˆh=, inflection can only attach to the end of the NP. Examples of
appositional NPs involving nominalized adjectives are given in (131-32).

Where multiple adjectival modifiers occur in reference to a given entity, consultants
judge tˆh= to be obligatory on all of them:

this=fruit 3sg=big3sg=badfall-TEL-DYNM‘This big ugly fruit fell.’ (EL)Adjectives taking tˆh= are clearly nominalizations. For example, a nominal416negator is required when tˆh= is present (example 134a-b), whereas a predicate adjective
(or a ‘bare’ adjective modifier within an NP, see above) takes a verbal negator (135).(134) a)cadaka‡/ tˆh=po‡g /a‡p

(135) /amˆ‡hpãêt w’´t-nˆ¤h2sg.POSS hairlong-NEG‘Your hair is not long’ (EL)
The [N tˆh=Adj] type of NP may optionally also pattern like a single NP
constituent, with inflectional marking occurring only once, at the end the unit, regardless
of the presence of tˆh=. Moreover, in many cases neither pause phenomena nor
consultants’ Portuguese translations of [N tˆh=Adj] constructions provide support for two
distinct NPs, and consultants often judge the variants ([N Adj] and [N tˆh=Adj]) to be
interchangeable.
Within NPs of the form [N tˆh=Adj], the main function of tˆh= appears to be one
of placing additional focus on the quality conveyed by the adjective. In particular, the [N
tˆh=Adj] construction always indicates a quality that is inherent or permanent, while an
adjective modifier without tˆh= may be either permanent or temporary. (Note that this
association of the more nominal form with a more time-stable attribute, and the more
verbal form with a more fleeting attribute, parallels the prototypical semantic distinction417between verbs and nouns across languages; it is also a characteristic of the bound
nominal construction, which typically signals a whole-part or inalienably possessed
relationship.) For example, a naturally dark-skinned hand is described as dapu‚êh (tˆh=)j’á
(hand [3sg=]black); but tˆh= is ungrammatical when referring to a soot-blackened hand,
which would be dapu‚êh j’á(-áy) (hand black[-DYNM]). Some adjectives, such as color
terms, almost always appear with tˆh=, and a few have even undergone phonological
reduction (consonant cluster simplification and vowel harmony), e.g. tuhúp ‘beautiful,
new’ and tˆdó [tˆRó] ‘red’ (Umari Norte dialect only). Examples of this type of adjectival
NP are given in (136-37).(136) j’ám

Where it occurs between noun and adjective in what appears to be a single NP
constituent, the marker tˆh= may be developing an identity as an attributive marker,
functioning to signal the connection between the nominal and the modifier in the NP.
While the above discussion has argued that the bound noun and the adjectival NP cannot
be considered the same construction synchronically, it is very likely that they are
historically and/or functionally related. Typological work has shown that there is crosslinguistic precedent for the grammaticalization of a possessive marker to an attributive
marker (e.g. in Oceanic languages, Ross 1998; Rießler 2004); in a number of cases, such418as in Ural-Altaic languages (cf. Rießler 2004), intermediate stages apparently include
a nominalizer, marker of definiteness, and marker of anaphoric-demonstrative focus. In
Hup, as this discussion has shown, one and the same marker tˆh= has the role of a marker
of inalienable possession (and individuation, related to definiteness) with nouns, and of
nominalization and—to some degree—focus and attribution with adjectives.","[431, 432, 433, 434, 435]"

Example (83) illustrates two Obliques in a single clause, one marking an instrumental
role, the other a locative role. Note that the case marker occurs on the final constituent of
the (N + Adj) NP and of the compound nominal, as is standard for all case markers in

The Oblique’s locative function indicates that X is at the place of Y. In this semantic role
(but not in the comitative or instrumental), consultants usually judge Oblique -Vêt to be
grammatically interchangeable with the (object-like) Directional marker -an, and can
give no insights into any semantic difference between the two options (this is the case, for
example, in 84-88 below).63 Nevertheless, a comparison of how the two pattern naturally
in discourse suggests that -an is preferred where the spatial range in question extends
beyond the point of reference, while -Vêt is preferred when the event is carried out
completely within the given location, without reference to directional movement from, to,
or through it.","[264, 265]"
"Desano=PLTuyuca=PL3pl-INCH=EMPH.COthat.ITG-FLR-DECLthe Desanos… the Tuyucas, it’s so for them too!’ (M-Kap.121)
The Declarative suffix -Vêh can also signal coordinated nominal entities (example
141), and is likewise sometimes used to indicate clause coordination (cf. §17.3.2 and
§18.1.2)

Other strategies for coordinating multiple nominal arguments include use of the
‘Parallel’ marker =hin ‘also’ (§7.7), which—among other related functions—is used as
an optional emphatic coordinator (example 142), and the ‘Associative plural’ marker
-and’´h, which is links associated participants who are acting together (see §4.4.6). Note
that these two markers cannot serve a clause-linking function, unlike the strategies above,
but are limited to use with nominal arguments within the clause.(142) yúp=mahhˆd yçhçy-pˆ¤d-ˆ¤h,that.ITG=REP 3plya/ambo‡/=hin yçhç‡y,search-DIST-DECL dog=also‘So they were searching, the dog also searching,

This chapter presents the wide range of bound morphology associated with the
noun phrase and having functions relating generally to discourse marking. The forms
discussed here all associate primarily with nominal arguments, or else have specific
functions in combination with nominals that differ from their functions with predicates.
In general, these forms have functions relating to focus, emphasis, topicality, etc.
Nominal morphology relating more narrowly to the semantic or syntactic status of the
referent (primarily case and number marking) is covered in Chapter 4. Other forms in
Hup that combine relatively freely with various parts of speech (including nominals) and
undergo little or no change in function from one host to another are discussed in Chapter
15.
The forms, slot classes, and functions of the formatives discussed in this chapter
are summarized in Table 7.1:421Table 7.1. Nominal discourse-marking formatives in Hup

In general, Hup bound morphology tends to be highly promiscuous, as discussed in §3.3
(see also Appendix I). Even the forms that are most closely integrated phonologically
with their hosts (i.e. the vowel-copying formatives defined as Boundary Suffixes in
relation to verbs) are usually able to attach to various parts of speech, often occurring in a422range of distinct constructions, and serving a variety of functions. Accordingly, very
little nominal morphology in Hup is strictly nominal. As discussed in Chapter 4, even the
markers of case and number—the main inflectional forms that can be considered
primarily nominal—are not strictly limited to nominal hosts; the case suffixes are capable
of combining with verb stems to form adverbial clauses, and the case and number
markers attach to verb stems in relative clause contexts (producing nominalizations).
Bound formatives in Hup sometimes perform much the same function regardless
of the word class of their host, but in other cases their function may be quite distinct
depending on whether the host is a predicate, a nominal argument, or even a main or a
subordinate clause. One of the most striking cases of this involves the set of markers that
indicate aspect when occurring on verbs (and typically on predicate nominals and
adjectives as well), but which on nominal arguments tend to serve discourse-related
functions of marking focus, topic, or emphasis. Nevertheless, the distinction between
these forms’ functions with predicates (verbal, nominal, or adjectival) versus nonpredicate constituents of the clause is often blurred. A single form is often able to convey
a range of meanings, depending not only on its host and on the construction in which it
occurs, but also on the pragmatic context. The many possible variations are not all fully
clear in this work, and will have to await future clarification.
Among verbal morphological forms, some can also combine directly with a nonverbal predicate (adjective or nominal) with no change in either function or form, while
others require a copula host. To the extent that these forms are predicative, they are
treated together with verbal morphology (primarily in Chapter 12; also see 13 and 14).

"3485.6.4.1. From bound nouns to classifiers: a grammaticalization story
Clearly, a subset of bound nouns—mainly plant part terms—have ‘turned into’ noun
classifiers. But how did the shift from plant parts to classifying terms come about?
Where and how, exactly, have the two diverged?
Most importantly, while both non-semantically extended plant-part compounds
and classifying compounds have to do with individuation, they may differ as to what is
being individuated. In particular, the simple paradigms of noun-noun compounds (in
which no semantic extension is involved) have a certain ambiguity regarding which
component is being specified. This is especially the case with the plant-part compounds.
As we have seen, a plant-part compound can be interpreted either as encoding a
whole-part relationship, or as encoding a property-entity relationship—which is
inherently one of classification. A speaker may be dealing either with a banana tree and
focusing on its leaf, or with a pile of leaves and picking out a particular banana leaf.
Does the Hup speaker start with ‘banana’ and restrict it to ‘leaf-part-of’, or with ‘leaf’
and restrict it to ‘banana-type’? Is he or she foregrounding the property, as defined by
the entity, or the entity, as defined by the property? The compound itself is neutral as to
what counts as the ‘figure’ or new information, and what as the ‘ground’ or given
information (cf. Talmy 1978).
In defining a given set of compounds, this question of figure and ground translates
into the question of which slot in the compound—the slot expressing the different types
of leaves, or the different parts of a tree—is likely to be more salient in speakers’ daily
lives. For Hup speakers, as discussed in §5.4.3, the most prototypical paradigmatic
oppositions in plant-part compounds involve a constant form as the second member of349the compound (N2) and a varied set of forms as the first member (N1); moreover, the
stress pattern (where N1 receives primary stress) reflects the fact that the speaker’s
attention is more likely to correspond to the variable form than the constant one. This
higher salience of one paradigm type over the other reflects the typical interaction of
speakers with their environment: a Hup speaker is much more likely to be concerned
about the identity of a leaf or stick, because that is crucial to what he or she can do or
make with that object.
In the case of the classifier-type constructions, this tendency to foreground the
(N1) property has become crystallized—it is now the only option. Just as ‘banana-leaf’
gives us information about the identity of the leaf, ‘study-LEAF’ gives us information
about the type of book, but here no whole-part construal is possible. The first member of
the compound (N1) has now become the focus of the construction; in some sense, it can
now be considered the semantic head. The fact that phonological stress already falls on
the N1 form in these constructions surely helps to reinforce the interpretation that it is
also semantically stressed. At the same time, the bound N2 form in these classifying
constructions is becoming a grammaticalized morpheme, and as such is becoming
categorially distinct from ‘regular’ bound nouns. Its lack of stress and its compound-final
position give it a resemblance to the unstressed enclitics that are extremely common
elsewhere in Hup grammar. Finally, while metaphorical extension is a frequently
encountered feature of compound constructions in Hup (especially metaphors involving
N2), the existence of large plant-part paradigm sets of the variable N1 type (as in set 7
above) probably fostered the conventionalization of particular metaphorical extensions,350which in each case became codified along one specific semantic parameter, notably
shape (cf. Lakoff’s Idealized Cognitive Model, 1987).
There is also evidence that the reinterpretation of the semantic head in these
classifying compounds is being played out in the syntax of these constructions as well. In
some cases, the N1 of the construction is now arguably the syntactic head, as well as the
semantic head. The most likely force behind this change is lexical borrowing from
Portuguese and/or Tukano; this generated new terms, which Hup speakers would have
organized according to the system already present in their language for dealing with
manufactured or manipulated items. However, since the new terms first came into the
language as independent monomorphemic nominals, they naturally assumed the function
of nominal heads, to which the classifying form was subsequently added. Given the large
(and growing) number of these borrowed nominals, the classifying forms are gradually
coming to be perceived as something extra, tacked on to the main entity. In some cases,
the presence of the classifier is in fact optional:(171) píta (=b’ah)
mandádiya (=wˆg)
wéda (=teg)
badãêw (=tat)‘cassette tape’
‘medallion on necklace’
‘candle’
‘balloon’(Port. fita=SPLIT.WOOD)
(Port. medalhão=SEED)
(Port. vela=STICK)
(Port. balão=FRUIT)This ‘tacked-on’ effect of classifying terms is even found with a few native
words, such as those in (172), in which the classifier appears optionally:
(172) nçg’Q‡d (=b’ah)
núh(=tat) pog‘tongue’
(tongue=SPLIT.WOOD)
‘a big head’ (head=FRUIT big)
(when emphasizing shape/size of head)3515.6.4.2. Functions of the Hup classifier system and the typology of noun classification
The transitional appearance of the Hup classifier-like system brings us to the next
question: How do the Hup noun classifying terms fit into a general typology of
classifiers? Below, I consider the various functions of the Hup classifier-like bound
forms vis-à-vis the functions of noun classifiers cross-linguistically, and evaluate the
arguments for characterizing the Hup case as an incipient noun classifier system.","[364, 365, 366, 367, 368]"
"1543.1.1. Nouns
Prototypical members of the noun class are those roots that head noun phrases and
typically function as arguments of the clause. Unlike verbs, nouns can regularly appear
bare in the clause, without any inflectional morphology or other associated formatives,
and they contrast lexically for tone (see §2.3.2.2). Examples of nouns are given in (1-2):
(1)tˆnˆ‡hmç‡m3sg.POSS axenç¤h-ç¤h
fall-DECL‘His axe fell.’ (M.NS.65)
(2)yawa‡ç=mahtˆh cç¤w-ç¤h,capuchin.monkey=REP 3sgko/a‡pshoot.with.blowpipe two‘He had shot two capuchin monkeys with his blowpipe.’ (M.NS.65)
Nouns and verbs are also distinguished by the formatives with which they
combine, and under what circumstances the formatives occur. Nouns regularly inflect for
case and number, whereas members of the verb class can only take case- and numbermarking formatives when they are themselves nominalized or head adverbial clauses
(where the case marker arguably has a distinct function from its usual one; see §18.2.6.2).
Unlike verbs, nouns can be possessed (alienably and/or inalienably), and can be
quantified and otherwise modified by numerals, adjectives, demonstratives, etc.
Moreover, nouns and verbs are negated via distinct strategies (‘existential’ vs. ‘clausal’
negation, see chapter 16). Example (3) illustrates inalienable possession and case
marking on the noun:
(3)yˆnˆy=mah,/ãh=yawám-a‡nhˆdthat.ITG.be.like.DYNM=REP 1sg=younger.brother-OBJ 3plmQh-yˆ¤/-ˆ¤h
kill-TEL-DECL‘Then (he said) they killed my younger brother.’ (TD.Cv04.28)155Hup’s rich system of aspect-mode morphology is primarily associated with
verbs; nevertheless, many of these markers can also combine with nouns. Nouns acting
as predicates of clauses can take many (although not all) of these markers. Even when
acting as arguments, nouns can take some formatives that are (sometimes primarily)
associated with verbal predicates, although these markers often have distinct functions
depending on what part of speech they combine with; for example, the verbal Inchoative
aspect marker signals focus when occurring on nouns (see §7.1.1).
Nouns in Hup undergo regular compounding (which is also a feature of verbs), as
example (4) illustrates. A distinction exists between nominal roots that are ‘bound’—i.e.
that can appear only in a compound construction—and those that are free; this formal
difference corresponds roughly to the semantic distinction of inalienable vs. alienable
possession (see chapter 5).
(4)tecáphç)Ùp yam /ãh yam-té-htomorrowfishsong 1sgsing-FUT-DECL‘Tomorrow I’ll sing the Fish Song.’ (M.K.118)
The majority of the members of the noun class function exclusively as nouns, and
have no derived variants in other word classes. However, as discussed below and in
§4.6.1, some nouns can be considered to be derived from verbs (by removing the verbal
inflection and allowing the stem to function as a bare form, and assigning it rising tone).
In principle, this derivation can also go in the opposite direction, to derive verbs from
nouns; however, this does not appear to be a particularly productive process. Where a
verbal and nominal form of the same root do coexist, the verbal form usually appears to
be more basic and the nominal form more derived. In other cases, however, there is no
clear argument for directionality one way or the other; e.g. coh- ‘walk with cane/stick’,co‡h ‘cane/stick for walking’. A small subgroup of nouns yield derived verbal forms156via a different process: noun-incorporation with the verb ni- (see §9.6); e.g. hç‡m
‘wound’, hçm-ni- ‘have a wound’, while as a bare verb stem itself *hçm- is
ungrammatical.","[170, 171, 172, 173]"
"615contour and/or a focus on the resulting state that the event brings about or causes in
one participant; hi- is for this reason glossed ‘Factitive’.
Crucial to the use of hi- are the semantic roles of actor and undergoer, in addition
to the syntactic roles of agent and object. In many cases hi- is essentially signaling that
these roles do not match up according to the prototypical model.139 To the extent that this
construction relates to “subject affectedness”, or that it is “intermediate in transitivity
between one-participant and two-participant events”, it bears some resemblance to the
middle voice (Kemmer 1993: 2-3). However, it is unlike a typical middle voice form in
that it normally results in a multi-valent construction.
Factitive hi- usually occurs with stems that normally take only one argument,
particularly adjectives and stative or state-change verbs. In most cases it adds a
participant, increasing the valency of the clause, and has a causative reading. In (80-81),
the Factitive adds an agent, and the grammatical object O would be the subject SO—
semantically the undergoer—of the corresponding intransitive clause, as the non-Factitive
examples in (b) illustrate.","[631, 632]"
"INTERJ 3sg=black-FLR-DECLdarn it; (it was) a black one!’ (B.Cv.93)
In (127), the interrogative form hˆ‚-n’ˆh ‘what’ (a derived nominal) occurs in place of an
adjective (some unspecified color value), preserving the bound nominal construction.
(127) tˆh=hˆ‚-n’ˆ‡h /am túk-u/ ?
3sg=Q-NMZ2sgwant-INT‘What (i.e. which color beads) do you want?’ (OS)
Stress and tone (word-accent) patterns for adjectival NPs are not fully consistent
across speakers and speech events. The underlying lexical tone value for adjectives is
almost always high tone, with the primary exception of bˆÙg ‘old’ (it is possible that this
may be at least partially motivated by the contrast with bˆêg ‘tapir’). In general, a noun
phrase composed of [N Adj] is treated phonologically as a single lexical unit, with
primary stress on the second constituent. In the case of tˆh=Adj constructions, this stress
pattern is quite consistent: tone always falls on the adjective and is realized as rising
(except in the case of CV roots, which always have high tone). In NPs involving full
lexical nouns, on the other hand, tone on the adjective may vary. The pattern in less
careful speech tends to favor a pattern like that of the tˆh= form (including rising tone on
the adjective), but in more careful speech (especially in cases of potential ambiguity, such
as when the speaker is confronted with a minimal pair set contrasting by tone), the noun
may receive equal stress and take tone. In these cases, the following adjective assumes411its underlying tonal value (and so is usually high). In at least one case, this general
pattern gives rise to a minimal pair contrast:
(128) tˆh=po‡g
tˆh póg(3sg=big)
(lie big)‘big one’
‘liar’ (literally ‘big liar’, although tˆh by itself is not
generally used in this sense)Note that this pattern for tˆh= adjectival NPs is consistent with the most frequent wordaccent (stress/tone) pattern for bisyllabic (monomorphemic) lexical items in general (see
§2.3.2), and bound nouns with tˆh= are also always stressed on the N2.
The fact that adjective modifiers must take an explicit preceding nominal, for
which the default is the tˆh= preform, gives them a formal resemblance to bound (and
inalienably possessed) nouns in Hup (see §5.4). Compare, for example, the human noun
‘child’ and the adjective ‘big’ in the nominal constructions in (129):(129) a)tiyi‡/=dó/
tˆh=dó/‘male child’
‘child’b)tiyi/ po‡g
tˆh=po‡g‘big man’
‘big one’Functionally, too, there are parallels between the two constructions. The
prototypical bound noun construction signals an inherent relationship between two
entities, where the first possesses and/or defines the second (e.g. in a whole-part
relationship; see §5.5); likewise the adjective denotes a property that is inseparable from
the entity that ‘possesses’ it, and may be difficult or impossible to even conceptualize
without some kind of physical embodiment. Similarly, the association indicated by the
bound noun construction also helps to individuate the entity in question from other412entities like it (i.e. by restricting a set), just as the denotation of a property may have a
restrictive function, helping to pick out an individual referent from the set of possible
referents—although adjectives do not just restrict reference, but also enrich the semantics
of a known entity.
Given the formal and functional parallels between the adjectival NP and the
bound noun NP, could these actually be one and the same construction? If so, then the
relative order of modifier and head in the adjectival NP must be the opposite of what it
seems, as defined earlier in this section: [(Nom) Head + (Adj.) Modifier], where the
adjective is the modifier and the noun the head. As example (129a) above illustrates, the
bound noun construction involves the order [Modifier + Head]; is this actually the
structure of the adjectival NP as well? This does indeed seem to be the case for
adjectival NPs taking the dummy nominal tˆh—which is both semantically contentless
and phonetically unstressed, as in (129b) above (tˆh=po‡g ‘the big one’); here the
adjective (and final element of the NP) is a plausible head, at least semantically. This
type of adjectival NP really does appear to mirror the bound noun construction.
On the other hand, it seems much less plausible to assume that a noun-adjective
NP containing a full noun—such as tiyi/ po‡g (man big) in 129b—should have the order
of [(Nom) Modifier + (Adj) Head]; that is, that the adjective should be the head of the
construction. Yet could the adjectival NP in Hup be internally inconsistent, in that one
type has one order, and the other the opposite order?
It is difficult to resolve these questions definitively, since there are few syntactic
clues to headedness in Hup. However, to the extent that heads can be determined at all,413there is actually no reason to think that head-modifier order cannot vary within the
Hup NP; in fact, such syntactic inconsistency already exists among different subtypes of
the bound noun constructions. In §5.6, I argue that the semantic head of the bound-noun
NP may be ambiguous, and that for many NPs involving classifying bound nouns, this
ambiguity has fostered a switch of the syntactic head of the construction from N2 to N1.
Thus interpreting one type of adjectival NP as having head-modifier order while the other
has modifier-head order is not inconsistent with the facts of Hup more generally.
Given that significant differences between subtypes of bound-noun NPs and
adjectival NPs are possible in Hup, the question of whether the two constructions should
themselves be considered one and the same becomes less meaningful. Instead, it makes
more sense to consider them as distinct types of NP that simply share a number of
features. In fact, upon closer inspection, quite a few differences between them can be
identified.
First, were the parallel with the bound noun construction complete, we would
have to assume that the ‘adjective’ head of the adjectival NP is itself no more than a
bound noun; however, the set of bound nouns and the set of adjectives in Hup do not
actually pattern in the same way at all. Adjectives must be preceded by a nominal when
acting as the argument of a predicate, but appear alone (i.e. bare) as predicates
themselves; most bound nouns, on the other hand, can appear outside the bound
construction in contexts where semantic individuation is irrelevant, but otherwise can
only function as predicate (nominals) while bound. As the discussion in §3.1.3
illustrates, the identity of adjectives as a formal class of their own hinges on their
possession of both nominal and verbal qualities, and their ability to move freely between414argument and predicate constructions—usually retaining attributes of the one while
functioning as the other, and vice versa.
Other features of adjectival NPs that differentiate them from purely nominal NPs
include their stress pattern: while bound noun constructions with a full noun as N1
typically have primary stress either on the N1 only, or on both members of the compound
construction (e.g. tiyi‡/=dó/ (man=child) ‘male child’), stress in noun + adjective NPs
usually falls on the adjective (this difference can be seen in example 129 above). Yet
another difference involves the verbal negation strategy, which can be applied to
adjective modifiers within NPs (see 119 above); in the case of bound nouns, on the other
hand, the entire NP (and not simply the bound noun within it) must be negated by a
nominal negation strategy. Finally, another difference is the fact that unmodified
adjectives—unlike bound nouns—do not directly follow a numeral acting as N1
(although they can follow a demonstrative, see above). Instead, the adjective appears in
nominalized form with tˆh=, as in (130).

The differences between the adnominal adjectives and the bound nouns are
summarized in Table 6.9.","[427, 428, 429, 430, 431]"

In example (80), the relativized nouns are the subjects of the relative clauses and the
direct object and recipient, respectively, of a ditransitive main clause:(80)g’ájya/ám wç¤y-ç¤h,cutivara jaguar[g’ájhold.back.from-DECLwç¤n]-çw-a‡n-áh,cutivara follow-FLR-OBJ-DECL‘The jaguar protects the cutivara, from the one that follows the cutivara,

In (83-86), the relativized noun is the object of the relative clause and the subject of the
main clause. As expected (vis-à-vis the discussion above), case marking on the relative
clause (whether headed or headless) corresponds to its role within the main clause, not its
role within the relative clause.","[1020, 1021]"
"358father’s) language. This cultural focus on the emblematic function of language has led
speakers of many Vaupés languages to consciously resist lexical borrowing, even while
unconsciously allowing their languages to converge on a structural level (e.g. Sorensen
1967, Jackson 1983, Aikhenvald 2002). Probably for this reason, Hup speakers often
create a word from all-Hup components (verb/noun stem + classifier) for a new item,
even when they are aware of its name in Tukano or Portuguese. Likewise, when Hup
speakers do use a borrowed word, they typically tack on an extra piece of Hup
morphology, a classifying term, to give the new name a clear Hup stamp.
Finally, language contact with Tukano was surely an additional motivating force
behind the development of the classifier system. While at first glance this would seem to
be diametrically opposed to linguistic conservatism as a catalyst, the two factors manifest
themselves in different ways, which are not at all incompatible. It is a general fact among
Vaupés languages that intense language contact has led to considerable structural
convergence, despite speakers’ conscious efforts to keep their languages free from lexical
mixing. In fact, classifier systems in other Vaupés languages have been shown to be
sensitive to language contact (Gómez-Imbert 1996 for Cubeo-Baniwa, Aikhenvald 2002
for Tukano-Tariana).
Classifiers are an important feature of Tukanoan grammar, and in many ways the
Hup system looks like an incipient version of the Tukanoan one: Tukanoan languages
classify physical objects on the basis of shape, and animate entities on the basis of gender
(see Gómez-Imbert 1996, Aikhenvald 2000, etc.), just as we have seen for Hup.
Moreover, classifiers in Tukanoan languages appear in noun phrases with numerals,359adjectives, and demonstratives, with nouns as derivational markers, and with
relativized verbal forms (Aikhenvald 2000), just as they do in Hup.
From a typological point of view, the Hup case is particularly intriguing because
it represents a classifier system in its initial stages of development, with its nuts and bolts
still visible. Moreover, this is one of the relatively rare cases in which the effect of an
identifiable cultural change is clearly visible in the grammar of a language. Finally,
despite the likelihood that culturally novel experiences have driven the development of
the Hup noun classification system, its dependence on plant parts shows that the Hupd’«h
have dealt with these new experiences in ways that make sense within their world view,
in keeping with life in the rainforest.","[374, 375, 376]"

(space/time)18.1. Coordination
Hup has a number of strategies for indicating a conceptual link between two clauses,
where both are on the same syntactic level and neither is dependent on the other. These
strategies include simple juxtaposition of linked elements, as well as additional968morphological means for signaling the relation between them. In some cases, the
clause-level strategies can also apply to linked phrases or constituents within the clause.
As discussed in chapter 9, many distinct activities (usually performed by the same
subject) are expressed in Hup not through clause-level coordination, as they would be in
English, but through verb compounding, as in the following example:(1)(hˆd) /´g-yamhi)dç/-/e‡-h
3pldrink-sing-PERF-DECL‘(They) were drinking and singing (at the same time).’ (TD.Cv.98)
Such compounding involves co-subordination at the nuclear level (in the terminology of
Foley and Van Valin 1984), whereas in Hup linking or ‘nexus’ at the peripheral level (i.e.
involving whole predicates) is preferred for events that are conceptually relatively less
integrated. This latter type of linking is the subject of this chapter.","[983, 984, 985]"
