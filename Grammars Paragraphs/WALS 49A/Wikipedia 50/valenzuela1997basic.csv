Case-Marking in Shipibo-ConiboAs is typical in Panoan languages, SC exhibits an ergative-absolutive pattern in
most parts of its grammar. This is seen in the case-markers added to noun phrases or free
pronouns. As in most languages of this type, the ergative case is marked overtly, while
the absolutive case is marked by zero. SC can be considered as a rigid morphologically
ergative language, except for a few marginal constructions that will be discussed below.
The ergative morpheme {-n} has the allomorphs /-n; -an, -en, -in; -kan, -ten,
-tan; -man; -nin; -on; -ton, -tonin; -baon/, mostly depending on the number of moras the
underlying root has (Faust 1973, Valenzuela 1994a and b). This same morpheme, besides
playing the ergative function, is used to mark the genitive, the instrumental, and two other29
oblique functions, locative-directional and temporal. While it is the only way to mark the
ergative, genitive, and instrumental functions, there are alternative ways to mark locativedirectional and temporal functions. On the other hand, zero marking is also used for
recipients or goals. The following examples show the -nin allomorph playing theergative, genitive, and different oblique functions; the zero morpheme is marking objects
and the subject of an intransitive verb:

“Yerro ate (meat).”
Panare (Carib, Venezuela) is another instance of a language that signals morphosyntactic transitivity overtly; intransitive verbs have distinct tense/aspect/mode suffixes
and person marking prefixes than those exhibited by transitive verbs (T. Payne
1990:431). For example, Panare has different intransitive and transitive imperfective
aspect allomorphs. While -nëpëj is used with intransitive verbs, -mpëj is used with
transitive ones3 (examples taken from T. Payne et alia 1992:176, 183):A-s-awantë-nëpëj

Case-Marking Typology
According to Givón (1984:136), the case-marking typology of a language is its most
central typological parameter, since almost all other parts of the grammar interact with it.
The different case-marking systems are typological solutions to the same functional bind
between semantic role and pragmatic function of the arguments in a clause. There are
three basic ways in which languages respond to this need: nominative-accusative,
ergative-absolutive, and active-stative systems
It is now generally assumed that there are three basic syntactic-semantic primitives,
that for ease are referred to with the symbols A, S and O (Dixon 1979, 1994); or A, S and
P (Comrie 1978, as the first to so refer to them). S refers to the single argument of an
intransitive verb. In verbs involving two (or more) core arguments, the assignment of A
and O relations depends on the prototypical meaning of the verb used. A refers to the23
most agent-like argument, while O refers to the most affected or patient-like one.
Systems in which S and O show the same behavior, while A has a different behavior, are
called ergative-absolutive; systems which treat A and S alike, and differently from O, are
called nominative-accusative. As the terms are most commonly used, a nominativeaccusative language is one which marks subjects (i.e. A and S together) in the same way,
and differently from the object of a transitive verb; that is, these languages express the
opposition between subject and object. An ergative-absolutive language is one that marks
intransitive and transitive subjects differently; the subject of an intransitive verb is
marked in the same way as the object of a transitive one.
Split-S languages, also referred to as active-stative languages (among other
denominations, see Mithun 1991), are those that follow a middle strategy between
nominative-accusative and ergative-absolutive systems, marking some Ss like A and
others like O. Sa stands for the single argument of an intransitive active verb, while So
stands for the single argument of an intransitive stative verb. Seki (1990) points out that
although active systems have been treated as a variant of an ergative system (Comrie
1978, Dixon 1979), other studies (Seki refers particularly to Klimov 1972, 1977) claim
that the active type is a typologically separate system defined by a set of related
structural features on different levels of the language. Among other possible
characteristics of active languages (such as lack of adjectives, a split between active and
inactive nouns, and active and stative verbs), the subject of active verbs is marked
differently from the subject of statives; the subject of statives is marked in the same ways
as the object of transitive verbs. The structure of languages of this type is oriented to
express the relations between active and inactive participants, rather than the relations
between subjects and objects (Seki 1990).
Clausal Level and Inherent Transitivity
Hopper and Thompson (1980) challenge the traditional notion of transitivity which
restricts itself to the presence of a direct object in the clause, so that an activity is
“carried-over” or “transferred” from an agent to a patient. According to these authors,
transitivity is a global property of a clause that involves a number of components. They
identify ten parameters according to which clauses can be ranked along the transitivity
continuum. Each one of these parameters “...involves a different facet of the effectiveness
or intensity with which the action is transferred from one participant to another”
(1980:242). The values of these parameters are: two or more participants (rather than
one), action (rather than non-action), telic aspect (rather than atelic), punctual action
(rather than non-punctual), volitionality (rather than non-volitionality), affirmative (rather
than negative), realis mode (rather than irrealis), agent high in potency (rather than low),
highly individuated object (rather than non-individuated), and a totally affected object
(rather than a partially affected or non-affected object). Kibrik (1996:279) suggests that24
Hopper and Thompson’s list should include a parameter dealing with agent individuation or
definiteness. Kibrik points out that many languages (such as Ute, Navajo, Lithuanian, and
GeniuSiene) have been shown to be sensitive to the referential status of the agent.
Specifically, in these languages indefinite “actors” (Kibrik employs two macro-roles of
which “actor” corresponds to the most agent-like) trigger a morphosyntactic transitivity
decrease of the clause.
A prototypical transitive clause will exhibit a realis, punctual, completed action,
involving at least two participants, in which A is a definite/individuated initiator and
controller, acting purposefully on an affected and individuated O. A crucial consequence
of Hopper and Thompson’s definition of transitivity is that a single-participant clause
may rank higher along the transitivity continuum than a two-participant one, if it shows
more relevant transitivity components. They argue that morpho-syntactic markings tend
to be sensitive to clause-level transitivity.
Based on her analysis of Yagua (isolate, Peru) verbs, D. Payne (1985) contrasts the
notion of “inherent transitivity” with that of clause-level transitivity. Payne argues that
in Yagua there are degrees of transitivity that depend on the properties of the verb roots
themselves. Verb roots are sub-categorized according to three criteria: number of
participants (obligatory object participant, optional object participant, single participant);
semantic role of expressed direct object (patient vs. instrument); and allowance for taking
valence-increasing or valence-decreasing morphology. While the first two parameters
have a universal nature, the last one is specific to Yagua. Payne shows that these
properties cannot be attributed to clause-level transitivity, since they do not depend on
either larger semantic or syntactic contexts. To the contrary, it is the sub-categorization
properties of the verb roots themselves which partially determine the contexts where
they may be used. Payne claims that clause-level and inherent transitivity are similar and
partially overlapping concepts, and that a universal theory of transitivity must include
both of them.
A central aspect on which the different authors cited above agree is that transitivity
is a graded phenomenon that depends on a cluster of properties; therefore, we expect to
find better and poorer examples of (in)transitive verbs, rather than absolutely discrete
categories. As has been discussed in the section on prototype theory, these views
constitute the core of the categorization framework adopted in this study. Also, I will
make use of the notions of inherent and clause-level transitivity. While most SC verbs
will be shown to be inherently transitive or inherently intransitive, clause-level
transitivity will allow us account for most of the exceptions.
Identifying a Verb Argument
Probably the most important criterion for establishing verb classes is the number
of obligatory arguments that a verb requires. However, the determination of what25
constitutes a verb argument is not always straightforward. There does not seem to exist a
clear, well-established definition of argument. Within the transformational-generative
tradition, van Riemsdijk and Williams (1986) recognize the “more or less unanalyzed
intuition” of what is and what is not an argument of a determined predicate. This
intuition turns out to be “unreliable” in certain cases. The study of “selectional
restrictions” provides an alternative way of distinguishing arguments from non-arguments.
That is, a verb will place semantic selectional restrictions on its arguments and not on
anything else. The following English sentences illustrate the selectional restrictions test:
a. The sail seems to luff.
b. The hour seems to elapse.
c. The mole seems to die.
d. The train seems to derail (van Riemsdijk and Wiliams 1986:241)
The fact that the verb seems places no restrictions on the kind of surface subject
that occurs with it suggests that this surface subject is not an argument of seem. On the
other hand, the fact that the selection of the surface subject does appear to depend on the
embedded verb suggests that it is an argument of that embedded verb. Consider also the
copular verb be in English. This verb imposes no semantic restriction as to the kind of
subject or complement the clause may have. However, selectional restrictions do operate
between the subject and the complement. This observation might be considered as a
typical characteristic of copular verbs.
I will adopt the following definition of argument of a predicate: An argument of a
predicate is an (overtly expressed or not) obligatory complement (NP or adpositional
phrase) whose semantic nature is imposed and restricted by that predicate.
Lexical Argument vs. (Bound) Pronominal Argument Languages
After defining what constitutes a verb argument, it is necessary to briefly discuss
the different ways in which these arguments are encoded in languages. In the literature a
distinction has been made between two different language types: those with free lexical
or free pronominal arguments, and those with bound pronominal arguments (often called
just “pronominal arguments” (see for instance Jelinek 1984, 1985, Sandoval and Jelinek
1989, among others). In the former type, lexical expressions or free pronouns stand as
the verb arguments, with or without additional agreement on the verb. In bound
pronominal
argument languages, the bound forms syntactically express the verb arguments, making
additional free forms syntactically unnecessary. This latter type has been referred to as
“substitute” arguments (Nida 1946:142), as “cross-referencing” arguments (Gleason
1961:166), and as “head-marked clause relations” (Nichols 1986:61). In discussing
Panare, D. Payne (1995) considers that “a bound affix on a verb or auxiliary is argumental26
when it, alone, satisfies the argument requirements of a non-imperative, main clause verb.
A lexical NP expression may perhaps co-occur, but is not necessary in terms of the
syntax of the clause itself.” On the other hand, “a lexical NP expression or free pronoun
is argumental when it both expresses a core argument of the verb and is required in order
for a main non-imperative clause to be grammatical” (1995:3).
It is also possible that a language exhibits a combination of these two argument
types. Spanish is an example of such a split-argument type language, with bound
pronominal arguments for subject, and free lexical or free pronominal arguments for object
(Jelinek 1984:48-9). The sentences below illustrate the optionality of a free pronominal
subject expression, but the obligatority of a free lexical or free pronominal object
expression4:

“We found the perfect place.”
(Nosotras)
lo

(1PL:FEM) 3:MASC:OBJ found:1PL
“We found it.”
*Encontramos.
found:1PL
Payne (1995) further observes that “zero pronoun” languages such as Chinese and
Japanese have been viewed in phrase structure theories as belonging to the basic Lexical
Argument type. In certain languages, such as SC, “zero pronoun” forms are used for the
third person singular. Therefore, I am considering “third person zero pronoun” languages
as a subgroup of “zero pronoun” languages. As will be shown in the following chapter,
SC belongs to the Lexical Argument type.","[21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26]"

INTRANSITIVE VERBS
Dixon (1994:6) establishes three different language types according to the way they
treat transitivity. In some languages, almost every verb root is strictly classified as either
transitive or intransitive (Latin, Dyirbal). In a second type of language, the transitivity of
verbs is more fluid; that is, many roots in such a “fluid” language can be used either as
intransitive or as transitive without adding any overt marking (English). In a third type of
language, almost every verb root can be used as transitive or as intransitive, although often
by adding certain morphological markers (Fijian). In SC, there is a significant number of
verb roots that can either have an intransitive or a transitive use. But in most cases, the
root seems to be intrinsically intransitive or transitive and the forms with a different
transitivity value result only from addition of a specifically derivational (de)transitivizer
suffix. Therefore, SC seems to be a language that belongs to the third type described
above. In this chapter, I will focus on inherently intransitive verb roots.
Intransitive verbs are those involving a single participant whose case role is either
agent or patient. Syntactically, intransitive verbs allow a single core argument whosegrammatical role is subject. In an ergative-absolutive pattern, this single argument is
marked absolutive. As illustration, consider:
51)Same-0-ra
ishto-ai.
Same-AB-AS run-INC
“Same is running.”","[41, 42, 43]"
"Semantic and Morpho-Syntactic Transitivity
Semantic Transitivity
When dealing with the semantic structure of verbs it is important to take into
account that case roles, like any other semantic categories, encode mental representations
of events rather than objective facts (DeLancey 1991:346). The semantic representation
of events is a mental construal that departs from reality and does not exactly match with
it. Case roles are defined and assigned in terms of constraining event schemas and not
with reference to the larger more amorphous scenarios found in the lexical semantics of
verbs (1991:343). For example, a verb such as buy has four semantic arguments (the
seller, the buyer, the merchandise, and the payment); however, languages encode this kind
of event in terms of two or three-argument clauses.
Givón (1995:76) offers a semantic definition of transitive events subsuming the
notion of transitivity in the following three central features present in the clause:
a. Agent: “a volitional, controlling, actively-initiating agent who is reponsible for the
event, thus its salient cause.”
b. Patient: “a non-volitional, inactive, non-controlling patient who registers the event’s
changes-of-state, thus its salient effect.”
c. Verbal modality: a “perfective (non-durative), sequential (non-perfect) and realis (nonhypothetical) [event]. The prototype transitive event is thus fast-paced, completed,
real, and perceptually-cognitively salient.”
Semantically, an intransitive verb is one that involves a single participant, which
can play the semantic roles of agent, dative, patient of change or patient of state. A
transitive verb is one that involves two or more participants, most normally described in
terms of agent and patient. The prototypical transitive verb has an initiator, volitional,
controller, salient agent subject, and involves a “physical, obvious, concrete, accessible to
observation” change in the state of its patient object (Givón 1984:96).
Morpho-Syntactic Transitivity21
Morpho-syntactic transitivity has to do with the mapping between case roles and
grammatical relations that takes place in the clause. Transitivity has profound
consequences in the way the core arguments of the clause -agent and patient- will be
encoded, and particularly in the way this coding corresponds to the grammatical relations
of subject and direct object of the sentence.
Syntactically, verbs can be classified according to the number of arguments they
require. An intransitive verb is one which requires a single argument, whose grammatical
relation is subject. A transitive verb requires two or more arguments, whose grammatical
relations are subject and direct object. Often, languages have overt signals of morphosyntactic transitivity. For example, languages with ergative-absolutive case-marking
differentiate intransitive subjects from transitive ones. Yup’ik, an Inuit language of
Central Alaska, makes use of special suffixes to indicate whether a verb stem is
intransitive or transitive, in addition to ergative-absolutive case-marking. The sentences
below (taken from T. Payne 1997) show that intransitive verb stems are marked with the
corresponding suffix -u, while transitive ones require the suffix -a2:
Pam-aq
aya-llru-u-q.
Pam-ABS travel-PAST-INTRNS-3SG
“Pam travelled.”
Tom-aq
quyi-llru-u-q.
Tom-ABS cough-PAST-INTRNS-3SG
“Tom coughed.”
Nerre-llru-a-nga.

“I ate it.”","[20, 21]"
"27CHAPTER III
MAJOR FEATURES OF SHIPIBO-CONIBO
Morphologically, SC can be characterized as a dominantly agglutinative, suffixing
language. In morpho-syntactic terms, a fairly rigid ergative-absolutive case-marking
system allows for word order flexibility in this basic SOV language. The following
sections describe major features of the language that are relevant for the argumentation
contained in this study, such as the expression of arguments, case-marking, verb
inflection, use of pro-verbs, and the definition of transitivity.
Shipibo-Conibo as a Lexical Argument Language
Shipibo-Conibo is a lexical argument language, as defined in chapter II, for both
subject and object functions, since there is no marking of arguments on the verb.
Omission of required subject or object is normally understood as a zero third person
singular form. Consider the examples below5:1)Ja-n-ra
ea-0 jamá-ke.
3-ER-AS 1-AB kick-INC
“(S)he kicked me.”","[26, 27]"
"Shipibo-Conibo Verb Inflection
In this section, I briefly describe verb inflection in SC. In this language, a
declarative finite verb consists of at least a root and an aspect marker. There are two
aspect distinctions: The incompletive -ai (INC) indicates that an event takes place
habitually, that the event is taking place at the moment of the utterance, or that the event
will take place soon after the utterance. The completive -ke (CMPL) indicates that the
action has been finished by the time of some temporal point of reference, usually the
moment of utterance. Aspect markers occupy the last position on a main verb. When
evidentiality clitics (which are second position clitics) are attached to a main verb, aspect
markers are placed after them, thus suggesting their relatively recent grammaticalization.
Other finite constructions are those with the copula iki, including the future root-no(n)x
iki (root-FSSI7 AUXILIARY), and the narrative past construction root-a iki (rootPARTICIPLE AUXILIARY). In this language, noun, adjective and some adverb roots
can also function as predicates by adding the corresponding affixes directly to the root.
This is analogous to the English root paper, as in the sentence “He papered the wall.”
SC is a suffixing language, except for a set of body part prefixes (and maybe a
couple of classifiers) that can be attached to certain nouns, adjectives and verbs. Besides
these prefixes and the aspect suffixes mentioned above, SC verb suffixes can be classified
into three major groups: transitivity alternation suffixes, modifiers, and time/aspect
suffixes (Loriot et alia 1993:50-3).
Transitivity alternation suffixes include the “reflexive” (a gloss that will be
questioned in chapter VI) and reciprocal markers, the transitivizer suffixes -a and -n, the
causative marker -ma, and the applicatives (that is, oblique promotional suffixes) -xon
(usually benefactive), -(V)naan ~ -(V)n (malefactive), and -ki(i)n (associative).
Modifiers include the desiderative -kas, adverbial markers such as -kean “almost,”
-ribi “also,” -yora “much,” -tani “hardly”/“barely,” -res “only,” -na “warning,” -men
“quickly,” and -i “come (do x)”; direction of the action and aspect markers such as33
-tan “go and come back,” -kain/-bain “going,” -kiran/-beiran “coming,” -pake “going
down,” -ina “going up,” -shin “all night long,” -bai “all day long,” -yon “completely,”
-bekon “two people,” and the negative -yama.
Time/aspect suffixes include -ya ~ -yat “tomorrow,” -wan “earlier the same day,”
-iba “yesterday,” -yantan “some months/years ago,” -kati imperfect far away past, -kato
perfect far away past, -ni remote past. The plural marker -kan follows any time suffix
except for the remote past. The following sentence shows a verb root followed by
suffixes from these three major groups, and the plural and completive aspect markers:

oin-ma-kas-yama-wan-kan-ke
see-CAUS-DES-NEG-PST1-PL-CMPL
“The foreigners didn’t want to show us the money.”
Shipibo-Conibo Switch-Reference SystemThe SC switch-reference system operates between main and dependent clauses and
is expressed in the form of a suffix attached to the verb of the dependent clause. SC
subordinators can express three different kinds of information: 1) the relative temporal
order of the events of the main and the dependent clauses; 2) co-referentiality or noncoreferentiality of the subjects in the dependent and the main clauses (where “subject” is
the conflation of S and A); and 3) transitivity or intransitivity of the main verb. The
system is extremely rich and I cannot give a full treatment of it in this work, though I will
make a few observations.
Since the dependent verb occurs at the end of its clause, and the most common
order in a sentence is DEPENDENT CLAUSE-MAIN CLAUSE, switch reference
markers tend to be sentence medial. However, given that the main clause can also precede
the dependent one, switch-reference markers also occur in sentence-final position.
Note that when the subjects are non-coreferential, (in)transitivity of the main verb
is not signaled (these are the cases the term “neutral” refers to). Here the distinction
appears to be unnecessary since there is no potential case-recoverability problem when
the subjects are different. An instance of a case-recoverability problem would be one in
which the subjects of a dependent and a main clause with different transitivity values are
co-referential and thus undergo “equi-NP deletion.” In such an instance, the case-marking
on the overt subject NP will necessarily conflict with the case-marking predicted by the
transitivity value of one of the clauses (though not of the other clause).","[32, 33]"
"126
According to Kemmer’s typology presented above, SC can be grouped within the
one-form (reflexive)-middle type, since the stem resulting from the addition of -t may
have both a reflexive and/or a middle sense. There is also a set of “reflexive pronouns” in
this language; however, in most cases the presence of these pronouns is not required. The
following examples show the presence of the de-transitivizer allomorph -kaa in both
reflexive and middle clauses, as well as the optionality of the reflexive pronoun. Note also
that an inherently transitive verb becomes intransitive when this suffix is added:
Transitive
336)E-n-ra
rera-ke.
1-ER-AS cut-CMPL
“I cut it (down).”","[125, 126]"
"The fact that the same morpheme is used to express ergative, genitive, instrumental,
and locative/directional functions is a characteristic shared with other Panoan languages
such as Amahuaca andYaminahua (Hyde et alia 1980:139, Eakin 1991). (This also
indicates something about the diachronic development of the ergative morpheme, though
that cannot be explored here.)
The ergative pattern in SC is (in most cases) realized through a syntactically based
case-marking system (see Dixon’s distinction between semantically vs. syntactically
based case-marking systems, 1994:23-5). That is, the marking of core arguments that a
verb requires has been grammaticalized based on the prototypical meaning of the verb,
without regard to the actual instances of use. Therefore, the subjects of verbs such as
“kill,” “hit” or “defeat” will always be marked as ergative and their objects as absolutive,
even if in particular sentences they lack crucial agent or patient properties. This is
illustrated by the following examples of SC:
Non-volitional, non-controller, non-initiator agents

Verbs That Do Not Take Pro-Verb Forms
As mentioned in chapters III and VI above, when giving short answers to yes/no
questions, most verbs with absolutive subject marking take the “be”-based forms ik-í (beSSSI)/ik-ama (be-NEG) for yes/no, respectively; and most verbs with ergative subject
marking take the “make”-based forms a-kin (make-SSST)/ak-ama (make-NEG) instead23.
However, there is a closed set of intransitive and transitive motion verbs that does not
follow this pattern. Instead of making use of the pro-verbs ik-/ak-, these few verbs keep
their own roots in short answers to yes/no questions:149Intransitive rootsShort answerska- “go”

CONCLUSIONS
In this study I have made use of the notion of transitivity as the main criterion for
establishing major verb classes in SC. Morpho-syntactic transitivity has been described
as having a multi-componential nature, since it involves a set of properties, namely the
possibility of taking a direct object, the imposition of an ergative-absolutive case-marking
frame, the requirement of transitivity agreement in same-reference markers and certain
adverbs, the possibility of taking the malefactive, de-transitivizer, and reciprocal suffixes,
and making use of the transitive pro-verb ak- “make” in short answers for yes/no
questions. Some of these properties are more strongly associated with each other; for
instance, there is even an implicatory relationship between ergative-marking of the
subject, ergative agreement in the switch-reference system and intra-clausal adverbials,
and the use of the transitive pro-verb. However, the case-marking frame is not
necessarily associated with the possibility of taking the reciprocal suffix, nor does this
latter property imply the possibility of taking the de-transitivizer suffix. Also, some of
these properties seem to be more central to the definition of transitive verbs than others;
the possibility of taking a direct object, as well as taking the de-transitivizer suffix, have
surfaced the strongest criteria for identifying a transitive verb. Not all verb roots
necessarily bear the whole set of properties assigned to their class; therefore, there are
prototypical members of a category and non-prototypical ones. On the other hand, some
verb roots bear characteristics that pertain to more than a single class, thus falling into
different categories and constituting instances of double membership.
The notion of inherent transitivity accounts for the dominant patterns in SC; that
is, most verb roots are lexicalized as either intransitive or transitive in that certain
properties are either true, or not true, for all instances of use of the root in question.
However, clause-level transitivity has allowed us to account for some non-prototypical
members, and for what I am calling the instances of split-ergativity in the language such as
case-marking alternation in desiderative clauses to signal a highly referential individuated
object, or in order to accomplish a contrastive effect. The choice of the <ER AB> frame
in these cases, instead of the expected <AB AB> frame, seems to support Hopper and
Thompson’s (1980) claim, that clauses with a highly individuated object rate higher in
transitivity and this is then reflected in the syntax. Another instance of split-ergativity
that cannot be accounted for by the notion of inherent or lexicalized transitivity is the
controller vs. non-controller distinction with the verb root kinan- “vomit.” Certain
irregularities may be better explained by the need to avoid conflation between two
different verbs (such as the use of an unexpected case-marking frame in order to152
differentiate join-ai as opposed to joi-n-ai), or due to the derivational history of the verb
in question.
Intransitive verbs include the copula and existentials, motion verbs, verbs with
sentential subjects, meteorological/nature verbs, noun/adjective/adverb-derived verbs, and
two-argument intransitives (i.e. <AB OBL> frame). Copular clauses show alternative
zero copula forms. The negative existential yama behaves both as a copular predicate and
also as a regular intransitive verb root taking tense/aspect suffixes (yama has also
grammaticalized as the verb negative suffix). Inherently directed motion verbs take
locative and clausal complements; closed sub-sets of this group also have differentiated
singular/plural roots, and the alternative of taking a locative object. Also, a few
intransitve verbs can take nominalized sentential subjects. In all three kinds of
meteorological/nature verbs, the single argument is mapped onto the grammatical relation
of subject. It is possible to get intransitive roots derived from nouns, adjectives, and
certain adverbs, without requiring any verbalizing device. These verbs tend to express
(change of) states. A group of these derived verb roots referring to emotions/sensations
seem to be on their way to becoming two-argument intransitive verbs. These verbs might
be considered as non-prototypical intransitives, since they tend to occur in two-NP
clauses and, most interestingly, they tend to allow the attachment of the reciprocal suffix.
The verb mapet- “go up (obliquely),” has the possibility of taking a locative object and,
therefore, constitutes another instance of a non-prototypical intransitive.
In SC, transitivization processes include causativization and applicativization;
causative and applicative suffixes are different. The distinction between inherently
intransitive verbs and noun/adjective-derived intransitives accounts for the different
causativization possibilities that apply to each verb sub-class. While inherently
intransitive verbs take the causative morpheme -ma only, noun/adjective-derived
intransitives add the possibility to causativize by taking either -a or -n. The transitivizers
-a and -n correspond to a set of unaccusative (descriptive inchoatives and descriptive
states) and unergative (body movements, positions, and states) verbs, respectively; and
they are, with very few exceptions, mutually exclusive alternatives. When two
transitivization devices are possible (-ma, and either -a or -n), -ma tends to indicate
indirect rather than direct causation. On the other hand, -a and -n tend to indicate direct
causation, including physical intervention. Applicatives are the “benefactive” (also
malefactive when attached to intransitive verbs) -xon, the associative -ki(i)n, and the
malefactive -(V)naan ~ (V)n; while the first two can be added to both intransitive and
transitive verbs, the malefactive applies to transitive verbs only. In SC a predicate can
combine two applicatives, a causative and an applicative, or even a causative and two
applicatives simultaneously; the causative always precedes the applicative(s) in the verb
string.
Prototypical transitive verbs have been semantically defined as having an initiator,
volitional, controller agent, that causes a physical, obvious, concrete, observable change in153
the state of its patient. In the prototypical case, agent and patient are mapped onto the
grammatical relations of subject and direct object, respectively, and take the <ER AB>
case forms. Prototypical transitive verbs in SC bear all the transitivity properties
described above. This pattern has been metaphorically extended to perception, cognition
and memory verbs, in spite of having an experiencer subject (rather than agent) and a nonpatient second participant.
Complement-taking verbs have been organized according to the form of their
complement clause. A first sub-class of complement-taking verbs (keen- “want,” raan“send someone to do something”, yono- “order,” axea- “teach, make someone get used to
do something”) marks the complement verbs with the infinitive/nominalizer suffix -ti.
With the exception of axea- “teach,” these verbs correspond to the semantic class of
manipulation verbs. However, the verb keen- “want,” functions as a modality verb also
when the subjects of the main and dependent clauses are co-referential. A second subclass of complement-taking verbs (yoi- “say/tell,” onan- “know,” shinan “think/plan”),
marks the complement verbs either with -ti, or with the present and past participle
suffixes, -ai and -a, respectively. Finally, a third sub-class of complement-taking verbs
(namat- “dream,” ninkat “hear/ listen/understand,” oin- “see/realize”) seems to mark the
complement verbs with the participle suffixes only. Although further research on the
distribution of -ti as opposed to -ai/-a remains to be done, an hypothesis to be tested is
whether the infinitive suffix -ti is used in clauses with a more irrealis sense, while the
participles -ai and -a are used in clauses with a more realis sense. Transitive verbs with
aspectual meaning (peo- “start,” keyo- “finish,” and jene- “stop doing something”) are not
grouped as complement-taking verbs since the dependent verbs take simultaneous samesubject markers, like other intransitive and transitive verbs do. Furthermore, these
aspectual verbs can “exchange positions” with the semantically main verbs; that is,
aspectual verbs can also occur as dependent verbs, and thus be marked with simultaneous
same-reference markers, while the semantically main verb functions as the independent
verb. The group of SC verbs that allow direct quote complements includes yoi- “say/tell,”
yokat- “ask,” yono- “ask for, order,” and saí ik- “cry.”
Di-transitive verbs are a sub-class of transitive verbs that take two NP objects. In
SC, there does not seem to exist any morpho-syntactic difference between the two
objects; both are marked absolutive, they can exchange word order without changing the
meaning of the clause; and it is possible to relativize on both of them. Passivization for
direct objecthood is not available as a test for SC.
The non-prototypical transitive verb class includes cognate object verbs, the roots
keen- “want” and shinanbenot- “slip the mind,” and predicates that tend to occur with a
single overt argument. These verbs differ from the prototypical transitive class in that
they may impose a different or an alternate case-marking frame, which may cause
intransitive rather than transitive agreement properties, as well as the intransitive proverb forms. Also, some of these verbs do not allow an unmodified direct object NP,154
and/or may not take the malefactive, de-transitivizer or reciprocal suffixes. Some verbs in
this class exhibit more transitive properties than others.
De-transitivization strategies include the desiderative -kas, the de-transitivizer -t,
the reciprocal -(ana)nan ~ -nan, and the “be” verb -ik (discussed within onomatopoeic
verbs). The desiderative -kas lowers the transitivity of a predicate, since it refers to an
irrealis, non-implicative non-action, with a non-agentive subject and an unaffected object.
When the de-transitivizer suffix -t is attached to a verb root the resulting construction can
have a reflexive, middle, or passive meaning. A hypothesis to be tested is that these
resulting effects depend on semantic components of the verb such as event or state,
physical contact, and anymacy of the participants. Several verbs allow more than one
interpretation. The reciprocal -(ana)nan ~ -anan also has a de-transitivizer effect, since
(generally) the clause becomes objectless and the plural subject of the resulting stem is
marked absolutive. As mentioned above, most of the roots grouped within the twoargument intransitive verbs class (chapter IV) can also take the reciprocal suffix,
suggesting their higher transitivity status with respect to prototypical intransitives. As
for the de-transitivizing function of -ik “be”, it makes certain onomatopoeic verbs have a
reflexive meaning.
Finally, certain verb-types are grouped independently from the notion of
transitivity. The auxiliaries atipan- “can” and ja- “have to” lack an argument structure of
their own. Onomatopoeic verbs are very productive in SC; generally, they are formed by
attaching -ik “be” or -ak “make” to onomatopoeic words in order to form intransitive and
transitive verb roots, respectively. Also, there is a closed set of fluid verbs which can
occur in either an intransitive or transitive frame without taking any derivational device.
Furthermore, a set of verb roots take body part prefixes; the prefixed stems usually keep
the transitivity value of the root. Intransitives that take these body part prefixes seem to
bear motion/position, (change of) state semantic components; while transitives seem to
code events involving cause and contact. In addition, a few inherently directed motion
verbs do not take the intransitive/transitive pro-verb forms for short answers to yes/no
questions, but use forms based on their own roots instead. Besides these motion verbs,
also the existential and negative existential use their own roots for short answers to yes/no
questions; however, differently from motion verbs, existentials exhibit usual finite forms.","[148, 149, 150, 151, 152, 153, 154]"

The Verbs “want,” “love,” and “forget” in Western Muskogean Languages
Given that verbs such as “want,” “love” and “forget” are neither prototypically
transitive nor prototypically intransitive, it is not surprising that cross-linguistically there
is a tendency to code them by making use of peculiar case-marking frames. In this section
I briefly describe how Chickasaw, a genetically non-related and typologically different
language from SC, codes these verbs in a comparable way.
Chickasaw is a Western Muskogean language dialectically related to Choctaw.
Chickasaw has three sets of pronominal affixes which Munro and Gordon (1982) refer to
as I, II, and III. Overgeneralizing, Set I is used to mark the first argument of a transitive
verb and the only argument of an active intransitive verb. Set II is used to mark the
second argument of a transitive verb and the only argument of a stative verb. “The most
important use of the III afixes is to mark Datives of verbs, with I arguments. These may
include semantic Recipients, Benefactives, Goals, and Ablative” (Munro and Gordon
1982:84). Interestingly, these authors point out that many two-argument stative verbs
mark the first argument either with II or with III affixes. An example of a two-argument
stative verb that marks the first argument with II affixes is banna “want”; a two-argument
stative verb that marks the first participant with III affixes is alhkaniya “forget.” This
situation is comparable to the Shipibo-Conibo verbs keen- and shinanbenot- that mark
first participants absolutive instead of ergative (recall from chapter III that there is no
morpho-syntactic distinction between patient and dative in SC). Furthermore, in
Chickasaw, while transitives involving physical action mark an affected patient with a II
prefix, most non-active transitive verbs with I first arguments mark the second argument
with III. An example of the latter is hollo “love.” There is also a class of “more-or-less
active verbs” that mark a non-affected patient with a II prefix (1982:85-6). Although the
marking of the first argument differs from that of the Shipibo-Conibo equivalent verbs,
the fact that second arguments can be marked with either II or III pronominal affix sets is
reminiscent of the alternation between the <AB AB> and <AB OBL> case-marking
frames in Shipibo-Conibo. As a conclusion, the possibility of alternate expression of
arguments in SC reflects the intermediate transitivity status of these kinds of verbs and
their clauses, something to which case-marking seems to be sensitive in many languages.
Transitive Verbs with Low Frequency Objects
Wina- “row” and jono- “pull the boat” can be considered as transitive verb roots.
Both allow an object argument and impose the <ER AB> case-marking frame:
301)Rawa-n-ra
nonti-0
wina-ai.
Rawa-ER-AS canoe-AB row-INC
“Rawa is rowing the canoe.”","[109, 110]"
"151)Ea-0-ra
mi-on wini-ai.
1-AB-AS 2-OBL1 cry-INC
“I am crying because of you.”
Intransitive Verbs: ConclusionsIn this chapter I have presented the major types of intransitive verbs and their
clause constructions. Firstly, I have described the different kinds of copular clauses
(nominal, adjectival, locative, and possessive); in most cases, the zero copula construction
is also possible. Secondly, I have described existential constructions, which show a
different pattern for the affirmative and the negative forms. The negative-existential yama
seems to function as a copular predicate and also as a regular intransitive verb root taking
tense/aspect suffixes. Yama has also grammaticalized as the negative verb suffix.
Thirdly, it has been shown that inherently directed motion verbs exhibit special
properties: jo- “come” and ka- “go” have differentiated singular/plural roots (be- and bo-,
respectively). Together with other motion verbs, these can also take locative and clausal
complements. At least one of these motion verbs, mapet- “go up (obliquely)” has the
alternative of taking a locative object. Furthermore, a few intransitve verbs such as “be
possible/easy,” and “be impossible/difficult” can take nominalized sentential subjects. In
addition, I have distinguished three kinds of meteorological/nature verbs; in all three kinds
the single argument is mapped onto the grammatical relation of subject. Finally, nouns,
adjectives, and certain adverbs can function as intransitive verb roots without requiring
any verbalizing device other than the simple addition of verbal inflectional morphology.
These verbs tend to express change of states and states. A group of these derived verb
roots referring to emotions/sensations might be on their way to becoming two-argument
intransitive verbs because of the frequency with which they co-occur with an oblique67
phrase. The oblique suffixes -ki and -n show a fairly consistent distribution when used
with these predicates. While the former tends to code the recipient of the
emotion/sensation, the latter tends to code the participant in whom the subject is
interested. When the participant marked by -n takes a pronominal expression, a special
oblique set, different from the absolutive and the ergative pronominal paradigms, is used.
In chapter V, I will show that distinguishing between non-derived and the kinds of derived
intransitive verbs discussed in this chapter might have consequences in understanding
some transitivization processes in SC.","[66, 67]"
"The verbs associated with middle morphology can be grouped into different
semantic classes, such as: grooming or body care, non-translational motion, change in
body posture, indirect middle (self-benefactive middle), natural reciprocals, translational
motion, emotion middle, cognition middle, spontaneous event, and logophoric middle
(Kemmer 1993:16-19). The same author proposes a typology of middle and reflexive
markers in which she establishes three distinctions:
a) One-form middle systems.- the same marker functions as both a reflexive and a middle
morpheme (Guugu Yimidhirr, Changana, Pangwa, and German).
b) Two-form cognate systems.- the reflexive and the middle are similar, historically
related markers. The middle marker has less phonological “body” than the reflexive
marker (Djola, Russian, Old Norse, and Surselvan (Rhaeto-Romance)).
c) Two-form non-cognate systems.- the reflexive and the middle markers are two
different, historically non-related forms (Latin, Turkish, Bahasa Indonesia, Classical
Greek, Hungarian,and Sanskrit).",[125]
"102
Cognate Object Verbs
Cognate object verbs are those that take as their object an NP which does not
contribute to the meaning of the sentence. The overt expression of their object tends to
be more acceptable when these objects are somehow modified. In some of these cases,
the modifiers contribute to the meaning of the clause, functioning rather like an adverbial
(Levin 1993:95-6). The name “cognate object verbs” is due to the fact that the object is a
noun-form of the verb (and thus “cognate”), or of a semantically-related verb. In general,
clauses with cognate object verbs tend to conform to the agent-subject and patient-object
syntactic case-marking pattern, thus resembling a transitive clause (Givón 1984:105). In
this paper the notion of “cognate object verb” has been extended to instances where their
object NPs are very restricted semantically and do not contribute to the meaning of the
sentence, even though the verb roots and their objects are not genetically related. Some
SC cognate object verbs are: baken- “deliver (a baby),” bewa- “sing,” ae ik- “eruct,”
joti- “smoke (tobacco),” bekan- “spread (cotton),” axan- “poison (fish),” beax- “mix (the
new manioc beer with the fermented one),” and beten- “cook beten (kind of thick soup).”
The examples below illustrate the use of these cognate object verbs with created objects.
Some cognate object verbs impose an <AB AB> case frame:
271)Nokon awin-0-ra
westiora benbo-0 baken-ke.
POS1 wife-AB-AS one
male-AB give birth-CMPL
“My wife gave birth to a baby boy.”","[101, 102]"

CHAPTER I
INTRODUCTION
Introduction
Cross-linguistically, it has been shown that verbs fall into different semantic and
morpho-syntactic categories (Chafe 1970, Perlmutter 1978, Rosen 1984, Givón 1984, D.
Payne 1985, Levin 1993, Watters 1996, among many others). Categorizing verbs is
important since it is widely argued that it is the properties of the verb which determine
the number and kind of arguments that the verb will have, the relation of these arguments
to the verb, and also the possible alternate expressions of arguments and their
interpretation. For example, Chafe (1970) makes an initial distinction between states
(conditions and qualitites) and events; events can be further divided into change of state,
action, and change of state plus action. States and change of state events involve a single
argument, namely a patient; actions also involve a single argument, which plays the
semantic role of agent. A change of state plus action verb involves both, a patient and an
agent. The following examples can illustrate these four basic verb types and the semantic
roles they imply:
“The wood is dry.”
“The wood dried.”
“Harriet sang.”
“Harriet dried the wood.”(state -> patient)
(change of state -> patient)
(action -> agent)
(change of state plus action -> patient, agent)Furthermore, Chafe distinguishes verbs that involve all-encompassing states or
events; that is, that cover the total environment and not just some particular “thing”
within it. He refers to these verbs as “state ambient” and “action ambient.” Examples of
sentences containing ambient verbs are It is hot (state ambient), and It is raining (action
ambient) (1970:95-104).
Within the Relational Grammar framework, it has been claimed that in some
languages (such as Italian, Sanskrit, Choctaw, Lakhota and Dutch) there are several
syntactic phenomena sensitive to two classes of intransitive verbs: unergative and
unaccusative. This claim is known as the Unaccusative Hypothesis, and was first posited
by Perlmutter (1978). For the sake of exposition, I will describe unergative verbs as those
intransitive verbs whose single argument plays the semantic role of agent, as in the
English sentence He jumped. On the other hand, intransitive verbs whose single argument
is a patient are called unaccusative, as in The glass broke (Perlmutter 1978, Rosen 1984).
This paper intends to identify the basic verb types in Shipibo-Conibo (SC). This
is a challenging task to accomplish, since many of the “tests” employed in other languages15
are not applicable to Shipibo-Conibo. For example, in spite of being a basic SOV
language, SC seems to have a fairly flexible word order. When considering case-marking,
the same suffix can have an ergative, a genitive, or various oblique functions (instrumental,
locative-directional, and temporal). Third person singular subject and object are often
omitted from the clause, person marking in the verb is non-existent, and number marking
is basically restricted to the third person. Besides, it seems that the grammatical status of
recipient and patient with di-transitive verbs is the same. Finally, it is not clear that there
are morpho-syntactic voice alternations of the familiar sort in this language. Therefore,
this paper is devoted to looking for general and for language-specific morpho-syntactic
and semantic criteria in order to distinghish among different kinds of verbs in ShipiboConibo. An exhaustive description of the rich verbal constructions in this language is far
beyond the aim of this paper. However, I hope to make a significant contribution to the
understanding of verbs and verbal constructions in this fascinating language.
Chapter II presents a discussion of general concepts that are crucial in verb
classification such as the approach to categorization I adopt (Prototype Theory), the
notion of transitivity, the identification of verb arguments, and the ways that these are
expressed cross-linguistically. Chapter III describes central characteristics of ShipiboConibo that are necessary to understand the argumentation of this study; namely, casemarking, verb inflection, switch-reference, and transitivity parameters. Chapters IV and
V are devoted to showing different types of intransitive verbs and their behavior under
transitivization, respectively. Chapter IV describes copular and existential clauses,
properties exhibited by motion verbs, verbs that take sentential subjects,
meteorological/nature verbs, intransitives derived from non-verbal roots, and twoargument intransitives. Chapter V examines the use of different causativizers and
promotional affixes (henceforth, applicatives). I show that it is possible to sub-categorize
intransitive verbs according to the causativizers they take. The malefactive applicative (V)naan ~ -(V)n will be shown to be one criterion for differentiating between intransitive
and transitive roots.
Chapter VI discusses the properties of prototypical transitive verbs and the effects
of adding the desiderative -kas. Besides the prototypical mono-transitive type, this
group includes perception/cognition/memory verbs, complement-taking verbs, verbs with
direct quote complements, and di-transitives. Within the non-prototypical transitive
types are grouped cognate object verbs, verbs with alternate case-marking frames, and
transitives that seldom take an object. Furthermore, Chapter VI discusses phenomena
that cannot be accounted for by the notion of “inherent transitivity,” and that might be
considered as instances of split ergativity in the language. In addition, chapter VI
describes de-transitivization strategies; that is, the de-transitivizer suffix -t and the
different interpretations it triggers (reflexive, middle, and passive voice), as well as the
reciprocal16
-(an)anan. Chapter VII presents other minor verb types, such as auxiliary verbs,
onomatopoeic verbs, fluid verbs, body part prefixed verbs, and verbs that do not take
pro-verb forms. Finally, Chapter VIII summarizes the conclusions of this study.
The Shipibo People
The Shipibo are an Amazonian ethnic group that lives in the Ucayali area, between
approximately 6 and 10 degrees of latitude south, in Central Eastern Peru, Departments
of Ucayali and Loreto. There are approximately 23,000 jonikon “true people” settled in
about 130 villages along the Ucayali River and its main tributaries: Cushabatay, Pisqui,
Aguaytía, and Bajo Pachitea on the left margin; Maquía, Cashiboya, Roaboillo, Callaría,
Tamaya, Sheshea, Caco, and Amaquiría on the right margin. In the past, they considered
themselves as three different ethnic groups: Shipibo (the Pichico-monkeys), Conibo (the
Eels), and Xetebo (the Rinahuis, a kind of small vulture). However, presently these three
groups constitute almost a single unit that names themselves Shipibo. Their culture
shows great vitality, in spite of their long and extensive contact with the mestizo society1.
“Shipibo-Conibo” (henceforth, SC also), as the language is often referred to, is the
dominant language for the Shipibo people, or even the only one for many of them.
SC belongs to the Panoan family. There are around twenty Panoan languages
spoken in Peru, Brazil, and Bolivia. Since the whole Panoan population is estimated at
less than 40,000 people, SC is by far the language with the highest number of speakers in
this family, and one of the most significant of the Amazon rainforest. The most
important general descriptive sources on this language remain Lecciones para el
aprendizaje del idioma Shipibo-Conibo (Faust 1973), and Diccionario Shipibo-Castellano
(Loriot, Lauriault, and Day 1993).
The Data
The data upon which this paper relies have different sources. Most of it originates
from my own work and friendship with the Shipibo since 1990. Published materials have
also been used; namely, Faust (1973), Bardales (1979), Instituto Lingüístico de Verano
(ILV) (1979), Ministerio de Educación and Instituto Lingüístico de Verano (1982), and
Loriot et alia (1993). The sources of the illustrative sentences included here are indicated,
unless they come from my own fieldwork. The analysis of all the examples is my
responsibility.
The symbols employed in the SC examples are the same as those of the practical

Split-Ergativity and De-transitivization: ConclusionsIn this chapter, I discussed the marginal instances of split-ergativity in ShipiboConibo. I showed that at least for one transitive verb root, kinan- “vomit,” the controller
vs. non-controller distinction proved to be relevant. In this case, the notion of inherent or
lexicalized transitivity by itself could not account for this distinction. Also, I offered two
plausible hypotheses to account for the fact that a couple of verb roots require their
subjects to be marked ergative in spite of not allowing an object. In addition, certain
inherently transitive roots make use of case-marking alternation in desiderative
constructions (that is; they take an <ER AB> case-marking frame, instead of the expected
<AB AB>) if there is a highly referential individuated object, or in order to accomplish a
contrastive effect. The choice of the <ER AB> frame in these instances is in accordance
with Hopper and Thompson’s (1980) claim, that clauses with a highly individuated
object rate higher in transitivity and this is then reflected in the syntax.",[133]
"11Some noun-derived intransitives can also transitivize by taking the suffix -a. Consider
the verb root yometso- “be(come) thief” illustrated in 125) above. This verb transitivizes
by adding the suffix -a, in which case the resulting meaning is the transitive stem “steal.”
This transitive stem imposes an <ER AB> case-marking frame that links to the agent and
the dative semantic roles, respectively. The thing stolen is marked either as absolutive, or
as oblique with -n:

Derived Intransitive VerbsSC distinguishes different word classes such as pronouns, nouns, determiners,
adjectives, verbs, adverbs and postpositions. Besides verb roots, nouns, adjectives and
some adverbs can take verb inflectional suffixes directly and function as verbal predicates.
(Crucially, verb roots require nominalization suffixes such as -ai, -a, -ti, -mis, -yosma, kas in order to work as nouns.) Most of these single-argument verbs derived from nouns
and adjectives express a change of state undergone by the participant (that is, are
inchoative), or a state. As will be shown below, some derived intransitive verbs exhibit
particular transitivization properties.
Intransitive Verbs Derived from Nouns
In SC, nouns can be used as verb roots just by adding inflectional verb suffixes, and
without any other verbalizing device. Consider the following examples:bimi
“fruit”
ino
“tiger”
kapé
“alligator”
yometso “thief”
124)bimi“yield fruit”
ino“become tiger”
kapé“become alligator”
yometso- “become/be thief”Yoashi-ko Inka-n shinan-ketian-ronki rabe joni-0 kapé-ni-ke.
Stingy-DIM Inca-ER think-PDS-hsy
two man-AB alligator-REM-CMPL60
“It is said that when the Stingy Inca concentrated on it, the two men turned into
alligators.”
The verb yometso- “become/be thief” turns out to be intransitive and not the
transitive “steal.” A second NP, corresponding to the thing stolen can be added; however,
this would be encoded as an oblique rather than as a direct object. Consider the following
example:
125)Nawa-0-ra
yometso-ke
nokon santira-nin.
outsider-AB-AS thief-CMPL POS1 watermelon-OBL1
“The outsider stole my watermelon.” (Lit. “The outsider became/is a thief by
means of my watermelon.”) (Loriot et alia 1993:428)Intransitive Verbs Derived from Adjectives
Adjectives in SC behave similarly to nouns in the sense that they also can function
as verb roots without the addition of any verbalizing device other than the regular verb
inflection:
xana “hot”
ani
“big”
joshin “red”
bená “new”
siná “angry, fierce, brave”
raké “fearful, scared”

"134
De-transitivization strategies in SC include the desiderative transitivity decreasing kas, the de-transitivizer -t, and the reciprocal -(ana)nan ~ -anan. The addition of the
desiderative suffix -kas to a transitive verb results in a case-marking change on the subject
from ergative to absolutive. This case-marking change can be accounted for by Hopper
and Thompson’s notion of clause-level transitivity, according to which desiderative
clauses rank lower in transitivity than the prototypical transitive ones. This decrease of
transitivity responds to the fact that a desiderative clause violates all the semantic
principles of a prototypical transitive clause, since it refers to an irrealis non-action, with
a non-agent subject, and a non-affected patient. It can also be added that a desiderative
clause, unlike a non-desiderative one, encodes a non-implicative proposition.
According to Kemmer’s typology on the cross-linguistic coding of middle and
reflexive clauses, SC falls within the one-form (reflexive)-middle type, since the same
suffix is used for both functions. There is also a set of “reflexive pronouns,” but these are
not required in most reflexive clauses. When the de-transitivizer suffix -t is attached to a
verb root, the resulting SC construction can have not only a reflexive or middle meaning,
but also a passive one, probably due to the analogical extension of the reflexive-middle
construction to a passive-voice. The reciprocal -(ana)nan ~ -anan also has a detransitivizing effect, since (generally) the clause becomes objectless and the plural subject
of the resulting stem is marked absolutive. Unlike the de-transitivizer -t, the reciprocal
applies to most of the roots grouped within the two-argument intransitive verbs class
(chapter IV).","[133, 134]"
"Austin (1993:25) mentions that in a few Australian aboriginal languages, ditransitive verbs like “give” take two NPs marked like transitive objects; however, these
verbs constitute a very limited set. Diyari, for example, has only three verbs showing this
characteristic. The majority pattern in Australian languages is to mark the goal as an
oblique with dative case. Unlike the languages described by Austin, SC seems to treat the
objects of all di-transitive verbs like transitive objects.
Non-Prototypical Transitive Verbs
We have already seen some instances of semantically non-prototypical transitive
verbs, such as “see,” “smell,” and “forget,” that are morpho-syntactically coded as
prototypical transitive predicates. In this section, I discuss non-prototypical transitive
verbs that morpho-syntactically deviate from proto-typical transitive ones; namely,
cognate object verbs, the verbs keen- “want” and shinanbenot- “slip the mind,” and verbs
with low frequency objects.",[101]
"Transitive Verbs: Conclusions
In this chapter I first discussed the properties of prototypical transitive verbs,
particularly those that were not addressed in chapter III. The transitivity associated
properties in SC are: <ER AB> case-marking frame, same-subject transitivity agreement
in the switch-reference system or multi-clausal sentences, adverbial transitivity agreement
in mono-clausal sentences, the possibility of taking the de-transitivizer and reciprocal113
markers as well as the detrimental applicative, and having the forms a-kin/ak-ama as
short answers for yes/no questions. Verbs expressing perception, cognition and memory
violate the semantic principles of prototypical transitive verbs; semantically, they have
an experiencer subject (rather than agent) and a second participant that does not undergo
any change. However, the formal pattern for coding prototypical transitive verbs has
been metaphorically extended to the members of this class.
Complement-taking verbs have been structurally organized into different subclasses depending on the form of their complement clause. A first sub-class of
complement-taking verbs (keen- “want,” raan- “send someone to do something”, yono“order,” axea- “teach, make someone get used to do something”) marks the complement
verbs with the infinitive/nominalizer suffix -ti. In a second sub-class of complementtaking verbs (yoi- “say/tell,” onan- “know,” shinan “think/plan”), the complement verbs
can be marked either with -ti, or with the present and past participle suffixes, -ai and -a,
respectively. Finally, a third sub-class of complement-taking verbs (namat- “dream,”
ninkat “hear/ listen/understand,” oin- “see/realize”) seems to mark the complement verbs
with the participle suffixes only. Further research on the distribution of -ti as opposed to
-ai/-a remains to be done. Transitive verbs with aspectual meaning are not grouped as
complement-taking verbs since the dependent verbs in these aspectual sentences take
simultaneous same-subject markers, like other intransitive and transitive verbs do.
Furthermore, these aspectual verbs can occur as dependent verbs, and thus be marked
with simultaneous same-reference markers, while the semantically main verb functions as
the independent verb. The group of SC verbs that allow direct quote complements
includes yoi- “say/tell,” yokat- “ask,” yono- “ask for, order,” and saí ik- “cry.”
Di-transitive verbs are a sub-class of transitive verbs that take two NP objects. A
characteristic of di-transitive verbs in this language is that there does not seem to exist any
morpho-syntactic difference between the two objects; both are marked absolutive, they
can exchange word order without changing the meaning of the clause; and it is possible to
relativize on both of them. Passivization for direct objecthood is not available as a test
for SC.
Cognate object verbs are non-prototypical transitive verbs. When applying the
transitivity tests to the members of this class, the results show their intermediate
transitivity status. For example, while some cognate object verbs impose the <ER AB>
frame (as prototypical transitive verbs do), others take an <AB AB> or even an <AB
OBL> frame. Further, although some of these verbs can take the malefactive applicative,
none of the cognate object verbs take either the de-transitivizer or the reciprocal suffixes.
The verbs keen- “want” and shinanbenot- “slip the mind” also show intermediate
transitivity status. In spite of not marking the most agent-like participant with the
ergative morpheme, both verbs can have an object NP, thus imposing an <AB AB> casemarking frame. However, in terms of their inherent possibilitites, these verbs can also
take an alternative <AB OBL> frame. For these verbs, when the second argument is114
pronominal, the special set of oblique pronouns is used. The verb shinanbenot- exhibits
more transitive properties than the root keen-.
There are certain transitive verbs, such as wina- “row” and jono- “pull” that, in
spite of marking their subjects ergative and in spite of structurally allowing an object
second argument, statistically occur with just one overt argument. A question that arises
is whether the infrequency of making use of the two-argument frame will ultimately result
in a change in the grammatical transitivity status of these verbs, giving rise to an
unergative sub-class of intransitive verbs; that is, marking the beginning of a split-S
system.","[112, 113, 114]"
"Another cognate object verb that imposes an <ER AB> case-frame is beten- “cook
beten (kind of thick soup).” This verb root has the same form as the noun root beten,
which is a kind of thick soup; however, differently from other noun roots (described in
the section on derived intransitives, chapter IV), beten- has the peculiarity of being able to
function as a transitive root directly, without requiring any transitivization device. Here
are some examples:

CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK
Prototype Theory
As stated in chapter I, this study aims at identifying the basic verb types in SC;
therefore, it is important to discuss the approach to categories adopted here. This
philosophical choice will define the nature of the verb classes and of the grammatical rules
to be expected. The particular model adopted here is that of prototype theory. Many
functionalists in the linguistic field view prototype theory as a categorization model that
responds to the nature of human languages, and therefore to the kind of grammatical rules
necessary to talk about them. Before looking at particular instances of prototype-based
approaches to language, let us outline what is understood by prototype theory.
The traditional categorization model previous to prototype theory can be traced
back to Aristotle and Plato. It is based on criterial properties; that is, for any given
entity, a feature is either present or absent, and things belong to the same category if and
only if they share certain features which are necessary and sufficient conditions for
defining it. Following this approach, linguistic categories belong to a single class with
clear-cut
boundaries, all members are equally good examples, and grammatical rules are expected to
be exceptionless.
It was Eleanor Rosch who first proposed that thought in general is organized in
terms of prototypes and basic-level categories. However, the philosophical basis of
prototype theory can be traced back to Wittgenstein’s fuzzy-edged categories and
“family resemblance” (Lakoff 1987). According to the prototype model most members
of a category will be clearly distinguishable from most members of a contrasting category;
however, at least some categories will have degrees of membership instead of clear-cut
boundaries. Another principle of prototype theory is that categories are formed of
multiple criterial properties (instead of just one), some of which may be displayed by
more members. Attributes do not occur independently but they are strongly associated;
this means that in the majority of cases, having one attribute implies having many of the
others. Psychological categories possess a core meaning and instances of categories differ
in the degree to which they fit this core meaning; as a result of this “internal structure,”
some members may be better examples than others. Furthermore, the properties of
certain categories are a consequence of the nature of human biological capacities and of the
experience of functioning in a physical and social environment. Finally, it is due to the19
fuzzy-edged nature of prototype categories that metaphoric extension is possible (Rosch
1973, 1977, 1978; Givón 1984, 1997; Lakoff 1987).
As mentioned above, a prototype view has been embraced by several scholars in
the linguistic field. For example, Keenan (1976) describes grammatical relations in terms
of a cluster of semantic, pragmatic and grammatical properties. According to these
properties, languages will exhibit degrees of grammaticalization of their syntactic
relations. Givón (1995, 1997) has interpreted Keenan’s work as a prototype-based
approach. Another example of a prototype-based frame is Hopper and Thompson’s
(1980) influential article on transitivity. These authors question the traditional definition
of transitivity based on a single criterial property and identify ten parameters according to
which clauses can be rated along the transitivity continuum. Shibatani (1985) explicitly
adopts the framework of prototype theory to account for the fact that passives form a
continuum with active sentences, and that there is a passive prototype as well as partial
resemblances of passives with other constructions such as the reflexive, reciprocal,
spontaneous, potential, honorific and plural formation. Levin’s (1993) view of verb
classification constitutes another instance against the traditional notion of criterial
properties. Levin claims that the behavior of a verb is to a large extent determined by its
meaning. However, it is unlikely that a single meaning property in itself can be sufficient
to characterize a particular class of verbs; rather, it is the conjunction of properties that
together reflect the meaning components shared by the class members. Furthermore,
since many of these meaning components are common to other verb classes, the
properties attributable to a single meaning component will be present in various verb
classes (1993:16-7).
The prototype categorization framework is crucial in this study. For example, I
will claim that transitivity in SC is a componential notion involving a cluster of associated
properties, and that there are prototypical and non-prototypical members of the major
classes of intransitive and transitive verbs; therefore, we do not expect a clear-cut
boundary between them. A specific advantage of adopting a prototype-based approach
is that it accounts for the fact that certain verbs exhibit double membership. An instance
of double membership is the verb root keen- “want,” which can take a nominal
complement with alternate expression of arguments (<absolutive absolutive>/<absolutive
oblique>), a clausal complement with co-referential subjects (modality verbs), and a
clausal complement with non-coreferential subjects (manipulation verbs). Given the
characteristics described above, the rules posited here are not expected to be
exceptionless.
The Notion of Transitivity20
There are different ways to approach transitivity. It can be viewed semantically
and morpho-syntactically; we can also refer to “clause-level” as opposed to (but
complementary with) “inherent” transitivity. Transitivity can also be viewed as a
discrete vs. a gradient phenomenon.","[17, 18, 19, 20]"
"Properties of Prototypical Transitive Verbs
In this section, I will present the morpho-syntactic properties of transitive verbs in
SC. Firstly, a prototypical transitive verb inherently calls for two arguments, a subject
and a direct object (which prototypically correspond to the semantic roles of agent and
patient, respectively), and imposes an ergative-absolutive case-marking frame <ER AB>:

INTRNS “intransitive,” 3SG “third person singular,” TRNS “transitive,” ERG “ergative,”
3SG/3SG “third person singular acting on third person singular,” INSTR “instrumental”.
3The glosses for the Panare examples include the following: NEU “neutral,”
DETRANS “detransitivizer,” IMPERF:I “imperfective intransitive,” NONSPEC:I “nonspecific intransitive,” TRNS “transitive,” IMPERF:T “imperfective transitive,” 1SG
“first person singular,” OI “object initial sentence.”
4The glosses for the Spanish examples include the following: 1PL “first person plural,”
FEM “femenine,” DET “determiner,” MASC “masculine,” OBJ “object”.
5A glossary for the Shipibo-Conibo sentences can be found in the Appendix, at the end
of this paper.
6Arapaima gigas, also known as “pirarucú” in other Amazonian regions. This is the
largest scaled fish in the Amazon.
7The switch-reference markers are glossed in accordance to the following conventions:Order of the event of the dependent clause with respect to that of the main clause
P
“previous”
S
“simultaneous”
F
“subsequent (following)”
Co-referentiality/non-coreferentiality
SS

DS
“different subject”Intransitivity/transitivity of the main verb

8Besides the instances of transitivity agreement presented in the chart below, other
Panoan languages have different infinitive forms for transitive and intransitive verbs
(Amahuaca, Hyde 1980:145), as well as different associative case markers based on the
same distinction (Yaminahua, Eakin 1991:68).","[162, 163]"
"Therefore, the use of this verb root with the meaning “die” might be considered as
the lexicalization of an antipassive construction.
Case-Marking Alternation to Indicate a Referential Individuated Object
The Desiderative -kas
One way of forming desiderative constructions is by adding the suffix -kas to the
verb root. This morpheme can be attached to both intransitive and transitive verbs.
When added to transitive verbs, the case-marking of the subject changes from ergative to
absolutive. This case-marking change can be accounted for by recalling Hopper and
Thompson’s notion of clause-level transitivity discussed in chapter II. According to their
transitivity parameters, desiderative clauses are lower in transitivity than non-desiderative
ones. Among other characteristics, a prototypical transitive clause refers to a real action,119
in which A is an initiator and controller, acting purposefully on an affected and
individuated O. Differently from this, a desiderative clause is an irrealis non-action,
whose subject is semantically a dative (rather than an agent), and whose patient is nonaffected. (We will go back to the desiderative -kas in the following section on detransitivization.) Examples 321a)-322c) show that the subject of a transitive verb goes
from ergative to absolutive when this verb takes the suffix -kas:321a) Bima-n-ra xenan-0 koko-ai.
Bima-ER-AS guaba-AB suck-INC
“Bima is eating guaba (fruit).”
321b) *Bima-0-ra xenan-0 koko-ai.
Bima-AB-AS guaba-AB suck-INC
“Bima is eating guaba.”
322a) Bima-0-ra
xenan-0 koko-kas-ai.
Bima-AB-AS guaba-AB suck-DES-INC
“Bima wants to eat guaba.”
322b) *Bima-n-ra xenan-0 koko-kas-ai.
Bima-ER-AS guaba-AB suck-DES-INC
“Bima wants to eat guaba.”
However, as the sentences below show, case-marking alternation on the subject of
desiderative clauses can still be used to distinguish between a non-referential object as
opposed to a referential one:
323a) Ea-0-ra
yapa-0 pi-kas-ai.
1-AB-AS fish-AB eat-DES-INC
“I want to eat fish (referential or non-referential).”
323b) E-n-ra
yapa-0 pi-kas-ai.
1-ER-AS fish-AB eat-DES-INC
“I want to eat the fish (referential only).”
The next sentence could be heard from a Shipibo speaker who is in the capital city,
Lima, where the kind of fish referred to (paiche) does not exist; therefore, the subject
necessarily has to be marked absolutive:120
324a) Ea-0-ra wame-0
pikas-kiran-ke.
1-AB-AS paiche-AB eat-DES-coming-CMPL
“I would like to eat paiche when I come.” (But there is no paiche in the place
where I am now).
324b) *E-n-ra wame-0
pi-kas-kiran-ke.
1-ER-AS paiche-AB eat-DES-coming-CMPL
The ergative case-marking on the subject of desiderative clauses seems to be even
more acceptable when choosing between two or more things; that is, when the goal is to
more clearly individuate the object from surrounding items:
325)E-n-ra
wame-0

The instances of this kind of lexical transitivity alternation are very limited in
Shipibo-Conibo.
Body-part Prefixed Verbs
SC is a suffixing language, except for a group of prefixes that refer to parts of the
body and that are usually formed by taking the first syllable of the correspondent nouns.
These prefixes can be attached to nouns, adjectives, and to verb roots. They do not
occupy the object slot, but add information about particular parts of the body, thus
forming a sort of compound noun, adjective, and verb. The prefixes are the following:PrefixProbable root sourcebe-bero

prefixing the first syllable of the body part to the verb, as a sort of noun incorporation.
There does not seem to exist a single criterion to distinguish verbs that take body part
prefixes from those that do not. However, this class of verbs might be accounted for by
considering a cluster of meaning components, such as contact, motion/position, causation,
and (change of) state.
Some of these verbs present a shorter root form when prefixed. Therefore, in these
cases the verb stem is composed of a body part prefix and a reduced verb root. Consider
the following list of verbs that take body part prefixes:

SPLIT-ERGATIVITY AND DE-TRANSITIVIZATION
The present chapter discusses what can be considered as the instances of splitergativity in SC, as well as the de-transitivization strategies available. These two topics
are grouped together since phenomena such as lack of control of the subject, absence of a
second argument, and non-individuation of the object relate to a decrease in transitivity of
the clause, and also are relevant when dealing with split-ergativity in SC.
Split-Ergativity
Most morphologically ergative languages have some degree of split-ergativity; that
is, they exhibit an ergative pattern in one part of their grammar, but a non-ergative one in
some other parts. Shipibo-Conibo shows a dominantly ergative-absolutive case-marking
system, depending on the inherent transitivity of the verb used. However, there is a
marginal group of constructions that deviate from this fairly rigid pattern. Some
deviations suggest a different logic based on the properties of the clause and/or on the
semantic/pragmatic context. Firstly, there is a dominantly transitive verb root that is
sensitive to an agenthood-based logic, since an unmodified object (that is, an object that
lacks a modifier) is only allowed when the agent is a controller of the action. Secondly,
there are a couple of verb roots that cannot take an object but nevertheless require that
their single argument be marked ergative instead of absolutive. Thirdly, certain transitive
verbs make use of alternate case-marking frames in desiderative constructions depending
on the individuation of referential objects. These kind of clauses deviate from the quite
rigid syntactically-based ergative-absolutive pattern described in the preceding chapter,
and illustrate that there is some (minimal) degree of split-ergativity in Shipibo-Conibo.
The Controller vs. Non-Controller Distinction
We can say that kinan- “vomit” is an inherently transitive verb, based on the
following criteria: Its subject is marked ergative, it requires inter-clausal and intra-clausal
transitivity agreement, it takes the a-kin/ak-ama pro-verb forms as short answers to
yes/no questions, it can take the malefactive, de-transitivizer, and reciprocal suffixes.
However, kinan- has the peculiarity of not allowing the presence of an unmodified object
(typical of cognate object verbs), unless the subject controls the action. Consider the
examples below:116311)E-n-ra
kinan-ke.
1-ER-AS vomit-CMPL
“I vomited.”312a) *E-n-ra kinan-ke
aros-0.
1-ER-AS vomit-CMPL rice-AB
“I vomited the rice.”
313a) *E-n-ra kinan-ke
yapa-0.
1-ER-AS vomit-CMPL fish-AB
“I vomited the fish.”
But:
312b) E-n-ra
kinan-ke
aros-bires.
1-ER-AS vomit-CMPL rice-only
“I vomited pure rice”
313b) E-n-ra
kinan-ke
yapa-bires.
1-ER-AS vomit-CMPL fish-only
“I vomited pure fish.”
In Amazonian cultures beverages that induce vomiting are drunk to acquire desired
qualities or skills. Interestingly, when kinan- refers to a provoked action, it allows the
presence of an unmodified object, as shown below:
314)Inon Sina-kan-ra kinan-ke
manxa-man kawá-ti-0.
Inon Siná-ER-AS vomit-CMPL heron-GEN bridge-AB
“Inon Siná vomited manxaman kawáti (kind of herb prepared as beverage and
drunk to become good fisher/hunter).”","[114, 115, 116]"
"73
162c) E-n-ra
ompax-0 xana-ma-ai.
1-ER-AS water-AB become.hot-CAUS-INC
“I heat the water (taking constant care of it).”
As the examples above show, when there is a semantic distinction between the
verbs transitivized with -a and those transitivized with -ma, the forms that take -ma
imply a greater involvement of the agent in getting the action executed, such as taking care
while things undergo a change. However, the suffix -ma also seems to indicate that the
agent is not the most immediate cause of the change the patient undergoes. Let us see
another example with a derived intransitive verb which confirms this kind of indirect
causation:
163a) E-n-ra
bená-a-i
soro-0.
1-ER-AS become.new-TRNZ-INC sol-AB
“I make the coin (look) new.”
163b) *E-n-ra soro-0 bená-ma-i.
1-ER-AS sol-AB become.new-CAUS-INC
“I make the coin (look) new.” (e.g. I exert some sort or effect such that the inner
force or action of the coin itself produces the new appearance.)
Sentence 163b) is not acceptable since it would imply that the coin has some
possibility of becoming new by itself, without the subject’s direct causation. This
unacceptability of 163b) is consistent with our interpretation of -ma with these kind of
verbs as an indirect causation marker. On the other hand, the derived verb root bimi“yield fruit” can take the causativizer -ma indicating indirect causation, but not the suffix
-a since trees yield fruit by themselves without requiring of an external causer. However,
the transitive stem bimi-ma- also indicates a greater involvement of the participant, in the
sense of taking constant care while the patient undergoes the change:
164a) E-n-ra
kaimito-0 bimi-ma-i.
1-ER-AS caimito-AB yield.fruit-CAUS-INC
“I am taking care of the caimito till it yield fruits (I don’t let anybody touch it).”
164b) *E-n-ra kaimito-0 bimi-a-ai.
1-ER-AS caimito-AB yield.fruit-TRNZ-INC
“I made the caimito yield fruit”.
Not all intransitive verbs derived from adjectives can take the -a transitivizer (for
example, benes “lowered (referent to the water)” but *benes-a-). At least one74
unaccusative derived intransitives can take both the -a and -n transitivizers (bata “sweet,”
bata- “become sweet,” bata-a-/bata-n- “sweeten”). Finally, some intransitive verbs
derived from nouns can also transitivize by taking -a (axe “custom/use,” axe- “get used
to/learn,” axe-a- “teach”; bobon “boil,” bobon- “boils appear,” bobon-a- “cause boils”;
bonko “virgin forest,” bonko- “grow impenetrable forest,” bonko-a- “make forest grow”).
The Transitivizer -n: Unergative Verbs
There is a closed set of intransitive verbs that transitivize by adding the suffix -n.
These verbs seem to refer to body movements or positions that can be intentionally
assumed. However, this group includes a few derived intransitives coming from nouns
and adjectives. When compared with the verbs that transitivize by adding the -a suffix,
these verb roots seem to refer to activities more likely to be controlled by the participant,
and more interestingly, the single argument of these verbs is semantically an agent, thus
corresponding to the definition of unergative verbs as intransitive verbs whose single
argument plays the semantic role of agent.13 Consider the following verbs that take the
suffix -n:
chankat- “stand on two feet”
charot-“be standing (people)
ashpat- “open the legs”
beba- “cross to the opposite side”
oxa- “sleep”
wenit- “stand up”
rakat- “lie”
mapet- “go up obliquely”
tsamat- “group oneself”
bata- “become sweet”chanka-n- “make something stand”
charo-n- “stand (things)”
ashpa-n- “open the legs to somebody”
beba-n- “cross/trepass something”
oxa-n- “make somebody sleep”
weni-n- “make somebody/thing stand up”
raka-n- “lay something”
mape-n- “open/uncover something”
tsamá-n- “group, pile up” (tsamá “group”)
bata-n- “sweeten something” (bata “sweet)
bata-ma- “sweeten something”
(bata- also transitivizes with -a).","[72, 73, 74]"
"84
There are three applicative suffixes in SC: the benefactive (also malefactive when
attached to intransitive verbs) -xon, the associative -kin ~ -kiin, and the malefactive
-(V)naan ~ (V)n. As indicated above, while -xon and -kin ~ -kiin can be added to
intransitive and transitive verbs, the malefactive can be added to transitive verbs only;
therefore, this is an additional criterion for distinguishing between intransitive and
transitive verbs. It is possible for a predicate to take two different applicatives
simultaneously.
There seems to exist a major difference between Australian aboriginal languages and
Shipibo-Conibo with regard to transitivization strategies. According to Austin (1993:5),
there are some Australian languages with two or more suffixes; one used with
unaccusative verbs to form causatives, and the other with unergative verbs to form
applicatives. Other Australian languages have one affix only, that forms either causatives
or applicatives depending on the type of verb root to which it is attached. On the other
hand, Shipibo-Conibo has different causative and applicative suffixes, and these two
different transitivization devices can be attached to all intransitive verbs, even in the same
clause. In these latter cases, the causative always precedes the applicative.","[83, 84]"
"99Furthermore, these aspectual transitive verbs can “exchange positions” with the
semantically main verb, thus occurring as dependent verbs:258a) E-n-pari-ra
chicha
xea-kin
peo-ke.
1-ER-first-AS maize.drink drink-SSST begin-CMPL
“I was the first one to begin drinking chicha.” (Loriot et alia 1993:321)

chicha
peo-kin
xea-ke
1-ER-first-AS maize.drink begin-SSST drink-CMPL
“I started to drink the chicha first.” (Loriot et alia 1973:321-1)
Verbs with Direct Quote Complements
SC allows direct-quote complements with utterance verbs such as yoi- “say/tell,”
yokat- “ask,” yono- “ask for, order,” and saí ik- “cry”:
259)Jo-xon-ki,

DET child-AB ONOM be-PART AUX 1-AB receive-IMP uncle:VOC

“The child cried: ‘Receive me, uncle,’ he said.” (ILV 1979:55)
Di-transitive VerbsDi-transitive verbs constitute a sub-class of transitive verbs that take two nominal
semantically-obligatory objects. Many languages have morpho-syntactic means of
distinguishing between the direct object and the indirect object of a di-transitive verb. In
some of these languages indirect object advancement, also known as “dative-shift,” is100
possible (for example, English and Indonesian). There is another group of languages that
treat the two objects of a di-transitive verb alike. In SC there does not seem to exist any
morpho-syntactic basis for grammatically distinguishing direct objects from indirect
objects. As mentioned in chapter III above, the patient and the dative of a di-transitive
verb such as meni- “give” are both marked absolutive. Furthermore, both objects can
exchange positions without undergoing any morpho-syntactic change:
261a) Papa-n-ra
ainbo-0
koríki-0
meni-iba-ke.
father-ER-AS woman-AB money.ABS give-PST2-CMPL
“Father gave money to the woman.”
261b) Papa-n-ra
koríki-0
ainbo-0
meni-iba-ke.
father-ER-AS money-AB woman-AB give-PST2-CMPL
“Father gave money to the woman.”
To mark either the dative or the patient with any oblique suffix would make the
sentence ungrammatical. In addition, it is possible to relativize on both objects:
262)Koriki nokon papa-n
ainbo-0
meni-ibat-a-0-ra
icha iki.
money POS1 father-ER woman-AB give-PST2-PART-AS much COP
“The money that my father gave to the woman yesterday was a lot.”","[98, 99, 100]"

"It has been shown above that both roots, keen- and shinanbenot-, allow alternate
<AB AB> and <AB OBL> case-marking frames. These two verbs resemble twoargument intransitive verbs expressing emotions/sensations (described in chapter IV
above) in three important ways. Firstly, keen- and shinanbenot- allow the <AB OBL>
frame (which actually seems to be the preferred one). Secondly, when the second
argument takes a pronominal expression, keen- and shinanbenot take the oblique set of
pronouns. In addition to this, keen- and shinanbenot- have the pro-verb forms ik-í/ikama as short answers to yes/no questions, thus following the intransitive pattern.
However, differently from two-argument intransitive verbs which take only <AB OBL>,
these two roots allow the alternative options of an overt second argument marked
absolutive; i.e. <AB AB>.
When applying other transitivity tests, keen- and shinanbenot- exhibit different
behaviors from one another. While shinanbenot- can take both the de-transitivizer and the109
malefactive suffixes (which can be attached to transitive stems only), keen- cannot. The
examples below show the verb shinanbenot- taking the de-transitivizer and the
malefactive suffixes:
298)Oa-bo-0-res
topon-i-ra
ea-0 enbix-bi
that-PL-AB-only count-SSSI-AS 1-AB myself-EMP
shinanbeno-kaa-ke.
slip.the.mind-DTRNZ-CMPL
“Counting them only, I forgot (to count) myself.”","[108, 109]"
"Therefore, to mark the presumed subject of join- absolutive, as expected, would
cause a potential confusion between 316a) and 318), and this might be solved by requiring
the subject of join- to be marked ergative. However, example 318) above also suggests
that joi- “word” might be the ultimate root in the verb “breath” to which the causitivizer
-n is added, making it into a transitive verb. If this second hypothesis is correct, the
history of the form would explain the ergative case-marker.
Similarly to the verb root join- described above, the verb rebes- “die” requires its
subject to be marked ergative, in spite of allowing no object:
319)Moa-ra
papa-n
rebes-ke.
already-AS father-ER die-CMPL
“My father died already.”",[118]

"44Copular Verbs and their Clauses
A copula is an element whose primary function is to link a predicate nominal to a
subject. Copular constructions in SC can be divided into: nominal, adjectival, locational,
and possessive. Since the aseverative second position clitic -ra can either be suffixed to
the first constituent of the clause or prefixed to the copula verb, the copula iki can occur
by itself or prefixed, in which case it turns out as r-iki.
Nominal Copular Clauses
Nominal copular clauses can be equational or attributive in function:
54)Oa joni-0-ra
nokon papa iki.
that man-AB-AS POS1 father COP
“That man is my father.”","[43, 44]"
"13Note that most of these verb roots end in -t, and that this -t is lost when adding the
transitivizer -n! An alternative analysis would be to consider these roots as neutral in
terms of inherent transitivity, requiring either -t or -n in order to function as intransitive or
transitive verbs, respectively. The fact that -t is a de-transitivizer suffix (as shown in
chapter VI below) supports this interpretation.
14I am including the interpretation given to me by a Shipibo speaker, although Faust
(1973:71) translates the sentence above as “The father helped his son go up.”
15Modality distinctions such as the English “may,” “might,” and “must” are also
expressed by making use of dependent verbs marked with same-reference suffixes and
adding particular markers on the main verb ik- “be”:
Ea-0
natex-kas-i-ra
i-bir-ai.

"135CHAPTER VIII
OTHER VERB TYPES
Up to this point, I have made use of the transitivity parameter in order to
distinguish verb sub-classes. In this chapter I will discuss verb types that either cannot
be classified as intransitive or transitive, or that have both intransitive and transitive
members but deserve treatment as a unified verb class. While some of the verb types
considered in this chapter have not been mentioned before (auxiliary, onomatopoeic, and
fluid verbs), others part-take in sub-classes of intransitive and transitive verbs already
described in previous chapters.
The Auxiliary Verbs atipan- “can” and ja- “exist/have to”
Atipan- “can” and ja- “exist/have to” differ from other verbs that can take clausal
complements in that they lack an argument structure of their own; the case-marking
assigned to their subjects depends on the transitivity value of the accompanying verb.
Therefore, atipan- and ja- are auxiliaries rather than matrix verbs, and their subjects arearguments of the verb phrase composed by the auxiliary plus the semantically main verb.
Similarly to the complements of the verb keen- “want,” and other complement-taking
verbs, in these verb phrases the semantically main verb takes the non-finite suffix -ti.
Atipan- “can”

1-ER-AS bring-IMP-make-CMPL ax
two-AB
“I ordered (him/her) to bring the two axes.” (Lit. “I told (him/her) ‘Bring!’ the
two axes”).
Fluid Verbs21Most SC verbs are inherently transitive or inherently intransitive. However, there
is a limited set of roots that can be used in transitive or intransitive clauses without formal
marking of a change in transitivity. The actual valence of these roots in a given clause is
recognized by the number of verb arguments, and through case-marking. Below I present
pairs of instances that illustrate the intransitive and the transitive uses of these few fluid
roots:
bepo- “have sleep in the eye” <patient>
bepo- “cover somebody’s eyes” <agent patient>
399)Nato bake-0-ra
bepo-ke.
DET child-AB-AS have.sleep-CMPL
“This child has sleep in his eyes.”","[139, 140]"
"In this case, the probable explanation of the unexpected case-marking is different.
The intransitive verb rebes- “die” seems to originate from the transitive one rebes- “reach
the end of ,” illustrated in the following example:
320)Moa-ra
e-n
paro-0
rebes-ke.
already-AS 1-ER river-AB reach.the.end-CMPL
“I reached the end of the river already.”",[118]
"The Verbs Keen- and ShinanbenotThe verbs keen- “want, love” and shinanbenot- “slip the mind” constitute twoargument non-prototypical transitive verbs that, unlike others, allow two alternate casemarking frames <AB AB> and <AB OBL>.
The verb keen- “want, love”
There are two different keen- lexical entries. One of them corresponds to the
prototypical transitive predicate “call,” which imposes an ergative absolutive casemarking frame. This is not the one we are concerned with here. A separate lexical entry
keen- “want, love” always requires two noun phrases; this verb alternates between an
<AB AB> and an <AB OBL> case-marking frame with no obvious differences in
meaning. This alternation is illustrated in the examples below:
286a) Ea-0-ra keen-ai
westiora xobo-0.
1-AB-AS want-INC one
house-AB
“I want a house.”286b) Ea-0-ra keen-ai
westiora xobo-n.
1-AB-AS want-INC one
house-OBL1106
“I want a house.”
287a) Ea-0-ra [Sani rete-kan-ti-0]
keen-ai.
1-AB-AS Sani kill-PL-NLZ-AB want-INC
“I want them to kill Sani.”
287b) Ea-0-ra [Sani rete-kan-ti-tonin] keen-ai.
1-AB-AS Sani kill-PL-NLZ-OBL1 want-INC
“I want them to kill Sani.”
The following examples are extracted from a narrative text about the “Stingy Inca.”
These examples suggest that the case-marking alternation exhibited by keen- may not be
pragmatically significant:
288)Jaska-ra ninkat-ax; [jawen jimi-n,
tawi-n,

“Hearing that, wanting his blood, bilis, stomach, all that, they came, all the

The example above lists the things that the animals wanted (blood, bilis, liver, and
stomach); that is, we can assume that all these props have the same discourse-pragmatic
status. However, even within the same sentence, a second argument of keen- can be
marked either oblique or absolutive.
The examples below are extracted from the same story, and refer to what men
wanted to get from the Stingy Inca. While “plantain” and “fire” are marked oblique,
“pineapple” is marked absolutive:

"While the coding of the non-referential/referential distinction in desiderative clauses
through case-marking alternation does not seem to operate with other transitive verbs, the
use of this case-marking device for individuation of a referential object has been attested.

Complement-Taking VerbsIn this section I present transitive verbs whose direct object is a verbal or even a
clausal complement. Complement-taking verbs are grouped into different sub-classes,
depending on the form of their complement clause. Another possible way of organizing
this section would be from a semantic perspective such as modality, aspectual,
manipulation, and cognition-utterance verbs (Givón 1984:chapter 4). However, the verb
classes that would arise from such a semantic classification do not coincide with the
classes that arise from structural criteria. It must be pointed out that further research is
necessary in order to fully describe complement-taking verbs in SC.
The -ti Complement-Taking Verbs
In this sub-class I group complement-taking verbs whose complement verbs are
marked with the infinitive/nominalizer suffix -ti (glossed as NLZ). With the exception of93
the verb keen- “want” whose subject can be either co-referential with that of the
complement verb or not, complement-taking verbs in this group seem to require noncoreferentiality of the subjects.
Keen- “want”
The verb keen- “want” does not behave as a prototypical transitive verb in terms
of its case-marking, in that it imposes either an <AB AB> or an <AB OBL> frame. (This
is discussed in a following section of this chapter dealing with non-prototypical transitive
verbs.) As mentioned above, the subject of keen- can be co-referential with the subject of
the complement clause. This co-referentiality allows for “equi-subject deletion”; that is,
the dependent clause does not have an overtly expressed subject. In these cases, keenfunctions as a modality verb. Consider the following illustrative sentences225)Ompi-0-ra
[to’ati-n
maro-ti-nin]
keen-ai; monso-0-ra
Humberto-AB-AS shotgun-OBL1 buy-NLZ-OBL1 want-INC mestizo-AB-AS

Inca-AB hill-turtle
eat-NLZ-OBL1 want-PART AUX
“The Inca wanted to eat the tortoise.” (Ministerio de Educación and ILV 1982:1)Also, the verb keen- can function as a manipulation verb in sentences with noncoreferential subjects:228)Ea-0-ra [Sani-0 rete-kan-ti-0]
keen-ai.
1-AB-AS Sani-AB kill-PL-NLZ-AB want-INC

168b) Ja-n-ra Sani-0 raká-ma-ke.
3-ER-AS Sani-AB lie-CAUS-CMPL
“He made Sani lie down (physically or not).”
We can conclude that while the stems transitivized with -n indicate that the agent is
a direct causer, the stems transitivized with -ma tend to indicate indirect causation. This
conclusion is compatible with the observations regarding the use of the -a transitivizer as
opposed to the causative -ma.
Applicativization
Applicatives can be defined as a (generally) valence-increasing morphological
device, that adds a verb argument with a semantically restricted object function. Kinya
Rwanda (Bantu), Nez Perce (Sahaptian), and Nomatsiguenga (Arawakan) are languages
which have rich sets of applicatives. When applicatives are added to an otherwise
intransitive root, “the derived A of the transitive stem corresponds to the S of the
intransitive root and an O argument is introduced” (Austin 1993:3).
Shipibo-Conibo has three applicatives: the benefactive (sometimes malefactive)
-xon, the associative -kin ~ -kiin, and the malefactive -(V)naan ~ -(V)n. Interestingly,
while the first two morphemes can be suffixed to both intransitive and transitive verbs,
the third one can be attached to transitive verbs only.
The Benefactive -xon
The benefactive -xon can be added to intransitive or transitive verbs. When added to
an intranstive verb it works as a transitivizer, adding a second participant; in these cases,
the subject or derived A (fromerly the S) takes the ergative marker, and the beneficiary is
marked absolutive. When attached to intransitive verbs the applicative -xon can function
either as a benefactive or as a malefactive, depending on the context. As will be described
below, the reason for this double function is that intransitive verbs cannot take the
malefactive suffix. The following are examples of intransitive verbs taking the
benefactive (sometimes malefactive) -xon:
169a) Nokon wetsa-0-ra
tee-ke.
POS1 sibling-AB-AS work-CMPL
“My brother worked (in the garden).”","[75, 76]"
"The following example illustrates the -a (previous absolutive) marker, indicating
that the object of the dependent clause is co-referential with the subject of the intransitive
main clause:
31)No-n
bo-á-ra
mia-0 yoyo i-ti-ma
iki.
1p-ER carry-PAB-AS 2-AB
speak-INF-NEG AUX
“ When we carry you, you must not speak!” (ILV 1979:48)This typologically rare absolutive co-reference marker is the same form as the past
participle suffix (glossed as “participle” PART) which appears in relative clauses and
other verbal complements.
More than one switch-reference marker can occur in the same sentence. The next
example refers to two twin brothers who shoot arrows up in order to make a ladder to the
sky. The subjects are always the same, the two twin brothers:
32)(a) Ja
DETpia-n-ribi,

“(a) Again, with this arrow they shot at another arrow’s end, (b) making (the
arrow ladder) longer, (c) so that they reached the ground. (d) After this, they went
back to their house.” (Ministerio de Educación and ILV 1982:23)
In all cases in sentence 32) the dependent verb refers to an event which is previous
to the one expressed in the main clause. The marker -xon indicates that the next verb is
transitive (“make something long” and “meet/reach something”), while -ax indicates that
the following verb is intransitive (“go”). In example 33) below, the same-reference
markers -ax and -xon indicate that the subjects of “go” are co-referential with the subjects
of “fall” and “behead,” respectively; the switch-reference markers -ketian and -aitian36
show that the subjects of “fall” and “behead” are different from the subject of the main
verb, “finish”:

some Australian languages such as Western Desert (Pitjantjatjara dialect), Warlpiri,
Warlmanpa, the Mantharta languages (Jiwarli, Thiin, Warriyangka and Tharrkari), and the
Kanyara languages (Payungu, Thalanyji and Purduna) (Austin 1981, 1988). SC exhibits
various instances of the switch-reference system operating at the discourse level. I will
present a folk story below for the reader’s perusal, though I cannot give a full analysis of
it here for reasons of space.

The Complement of Means/Interest Pronominal Set65
Another property of the class of verbs discussed in the preceding section is that
when the oblique complement (or argument) marked by -n is pronominal, it takes a
special set of pronouns that has been called “complemento de medio” (Loriot et alia
1993:34). This complement codes “the person or thing in whom one is interested” (Faust
1973:81; the translation is mine). This set of pronouns is as follows:1

"The Verbs join- “breathe” and rebes- “die”
The verbs join- “breath” and rebes- “die” do not allow an object, in spite of
requiring their subjects to be marked ergative. The verb root join- “breathe” can be
considered as closer to the intransitive prototype, since except for case-marking and the
agreement properties associated to it, join- lacks other characteristics of transitive roots
such as the possibility of taking the malefactive, de-transitivizer, and reciprocal suffixes.
Let us recall sentence 21) which shows the verb join- with a single overt argument, the
subject, marked ergative:

The -ti/Participles Complement-Taking VerbsIn this sub-class I group complement-taking verbs whose complement verbs are
marked either with -ti, or with the suffixes -ai and -a. Further research is necessary in
order to determine when either -ai/-a or -ti are used. The suffix -ai is the incompletive
aspect marker for declarative and interrogative sentences; the suffix -a is the completive
aspect marker for interrogative sentences and also the participle in the narrative past
constructions root-a iki. In addition to these functions, Faust (1973:84) considers -ai as a
“present-active” marker and -a as a “past-passive” marker. Consequently, the suffix -ai
is used when the action referred to in the dependent clause has not been completed at the
point in time set up in the discourse, while the suffix -a is used for completed
actions/events. (In the following examples, these two morphemes continue to be glossed
as incompletive INC and as participle PART, respectively.)Yoi- “say to, tell (someone to do something)”
