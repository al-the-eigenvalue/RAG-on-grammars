"4.1.2.6. The adjective suffix -s
The positive and comparative take the suffix -s when the adjective follows wat
something’, neat ‘nothing’, wat foar ‘what kind of’, and some other words:
wat dlds
neat nijers
wat foar raars is der no bard?hast neat betters te fertellen?“something old’
‘nothing newer’
‘what kind of awful thing happened
now?’
‘have you nothing better to tell?’Except for the plural ending, nouns in Frisian are essentially undeclined. There
are a few isolated holdovers from an earlier case system, but these are insignificant in the language today. Hence, as is true for English and Dutch also, the
function of a noun in a sentence is indicated not by its case, but by its position
in the sentence.",[32]
"Used substantively, soks occurs in the meaning ‘such a thing, something like
that’; sa’nen or sa’n(en) ien in the sense ‘one like that’ or ‘one such as that’; and
sokken with the meaning ‘some of that kind, those’:
sokken hoech ik net ‘I don’t need that kind (of things)’yn ’e tin‘in the garden’oan ’e kant‘on the side’When stressed, however, the full form always appears.
Certain relics of a more elaborate case system in the articles have survived into
the modern language. These tend to be preserved in phrases like op ’en doer
‘eventually’; mei der tiid ‘in time’; des Heare ‘of the Lord’; te’n ein ‘finished,
to the end’.
Another relic of this nature is the use of de for the dative case of it in a few
established contexts, as in it ’e hits ‘out of the house’; yn ’e Ais ‘in the house’
(cf. it his). The utilization of de in this sense is restricted almost entirely to
prepositional phrases of location, most frequently with h@s or midden as the
object of the preposition.
Expressions of time withfan present another peculiarity in the use of thearticle. The phrase fan 't jier, for example, means ‘this year’. Yet the seasons,though not neuter, sometimes take fan ’t as well, despite the fact that fan de (orfan ’e) would be expected: fan ’t winter ‘this winter’; fan ’t hjerst ‘this autumn’;
fan ’t maitiid ‘this spring’; and fan ’t simmer ‘this summer’. Other expressions
of time do not share this aberration: fan ’e moarn ‘this morning’; fan ’e wike
‘this week’.ik wol sa’nen ien hawwe ‘I want one like that’
soks liket my hielendal net aardich ta ‘that kind of thing doesn’t look nice
to me at all’
NOTE: Sa’n is a shortened form of sa in ‘soa’, corresponding to hoe’n from hoe in ‘how a’.
An adjective following in takes the ending -en when it stands alone or before ien (as in grienenien, sec. 4.1.2.3), which is thus a likely source for the ‘extra’ -en in sa’nen ien and hoe’nen
ien.",[29]
"5.3.3.2. Gerunds
Under gerunds are understood any verb forms which consist of an infinitive with
the ending -n. Infinitives which already terminate in n (stean ‘stand’, gean ‘go’
etc.) do not add another suffix. Such gerunds may function as verbs (with or
without a preceding te), in which event they are very similar to infinitives; or as
nouns, in which case they are true gerunds.
5.3.3.2.1. Gerunds as nouns
Any verb in the gerund form may function as a noun:
silen is moai wurk ‘sailing is nice work’
sizzen is neat, mar dwaan is in ding
“saying is nothing, but doing is something’
ik hald fan fiskjen ‘I like fishing’115nei it melken binne we klear ‘after the milking we are finished’
it jaan fan in earmban oan syn mem wie in hiele ferrassing
‘the giving of a bracelet to his mother was quite a surprise’
it briiken fan fergif is hjir ferbean ‘the use of poison is forbidden here’
This type of gerund may have an object standing directly before it, creating a
noun-plus-verb compound: it tsiisiten ‘the eating of cheese’; it weinmeitsjen
‘wagonmaking’. More often, the object is expressed in a fan phrase: it meitsjen
fan tsiis ‘the making of cheese’, etc.
NOTE: Apart from ‘external’ arguments, which take the form of a post-nominal prepositional
phrase (e.g. it sjongen fan ferskes troch de famkes ‘the singing of songs by the girls’), gerunds
may have ‘internal’ arguments (and adverbial modifiers), provided that they are introduced
by a determiner (e.g. dat lid ferskes sjongen ‘that loud song-singing’). Instead of a gerund,
a bare infinitive can sometimes be used as a noun (e.g. sjongen/sjonge hdld ik net fan). For
full discussion of the properties of the various types of nominal infinitives, see de Haan (1986,
1992), Visser (1989), and Looyenga (1992). Noun incorporation in Frisian (as in fuotfeie(n)
‘wip(ing) one’s feet’, etc.) is discussed in much detail in Dyk (1998).",[65]
"4.1.4.4. Reflexive pronouns and sels
In many cases there is no special marker for the reflexive
in Frisian; instead, the
regular object forms of the personal pronouns are used:
ik skamje my
se wasket har
hy stiek him yn ’e finger
heit skeart him twa kear deis‘I’m embarrassed’ (lit.: ‘I shame myself’)
“she washes herself”
‘he stuck himself in the finger’
‘father shaves (himself) twice a day’When there is ambiguity possible, and/or the speaker
wishes to emphasize that
the action is reflexive, -sels is suffixed to the pronoun:
se wasket harsels
heit skeart himsels‘she washes herself’‘father shaves himselfIt may be more accurate to state that the plain pronoun
is preferred with verbs
which are grammatically reflexive (skamje ‘shame’ , for
instance, which must havean object which refers back to the subject) or with
verbs which are most oftenreflexive (skeare ‘shave’, an action normally, but not
always, done to oneself).
In other cases, pronouns with -sels are preferred
and sometimes virtually obligatory, since with non-reflexive verbs the expected
interpretation of a sentence
like hy sjocht him yn ’e spegel is the non-reflexive
‘he sees him in the mirror’,
despite the fact that the interpretation ‘he sees himself
in the mirror’ is logically
just as possible. Even in the first person, where
absolutely no ambiguity js61Morphologyconceivable,’e spegelthe form with -sels is often preferred: ik sjoch mysels yn‘I see myself in the mirror

""When the sels precedes

it carries the meaning ‘even’:Sels Diirk hat yn tsjerke west
Durk hat sels yn tsjérke west‘even Durk was in church’‘Durk was even in church’To better see the contrast between these two varieties of sels, compare:
ik ha har séls sjoenik ha har sels sj6én‘I saw her myself’
‘I even saw her’iomc,;.4.5. Reciprocal pronounsand elkoar [elkwar] or [alkoor], translated into English as‘eachare
other’ or ‘one another’, are the reciprocal pronouns in Frisian. The two forms
wholly interchangeable:

The relative pronoun dy’t occurs following common nouns
and dat after neuter
nouns. Dér’t is used to designate a place: de pleats
dér’t wy wenje ‘the farm
where we live’. When an entire sentence is relativized,
wat is used. Examples of
all of the above are in sec. 5.3.4.
When a relative clause is preceded by an unspecified
head, as in the English
expressions that which or he who, an article or demonstrativ
e pronoun with the
suffix -jinge occurs: dejinge, itjinge, ditjinge, datjinge,

3plFrisian verbs can be divided into those whose preteri
te and past participle
formation is determined by rule (and are hence regular) and
those whose principal
parts are not regularly derived. The former are traditionally
known as weak verbs
and the latter are mostly (but not always in today’s langua
ge) strong. The weak
verbs are further subcategorized into class I and class Il,
remnants of an original
Germanic classification of weak verbs into four categor
ies. Class I weak verbs
are characterized by an infinitive which ends in -é, while
class II infinitives end
in -je.
The ensuing three subsections will discuss the formation
of the past tense and
past participle (the principal parts) of each of these three
classes of verbs, plus
giving the conjugations of the various tenses. Sectio
n 4.2.4 contains a list of
irregular verbs, and in section 4.2.5 the formation of
complex tenses like the
future tense, the past perfect, and the passive are discus
sed.

ending in -e, and are
indistinguishable in the infinitive from strong verbs.
There are only two tenses
in Frisian - the present tense and the preterite - which
are formed by inflecting
the verb. The rest are formed by the use of auxiliary verbs.

tense forms for two class I weak verbs, miene ‘think,

"46There is further the possibility for a normally inflected adjective to be uninflected
in certain collocations. This occurs in two main situations:(1) Before the word man and occupations which refer to a trade or profession:in fingewoan man ‘an unusual man’; in grut skriuwer ‘a great writer’. This
occurs only after the article in.
(2) When the adjectives ld ‘old’, jong ‘young’, lyts ‘little’, and grut ‘large,
great’ and some others precede nouns with which they enter into a close
relationship semantically: de did feint ‘the old fellow’ ; dat nij his ‘that new
house’; dy ald skuorre ‘that old shed’; de jongfaam ‘the young woman’ ; dat
grou fanke ‘that big girl’. These collocations are very much like compounds,
including how they are stressed, and are sometimes indeed written as one
word. Ald feint has stress on the latter element, as ina compound, while aide
feint stresses both elements. In every case the inflected adjective may also be
utilized: de jonge faam is every bit as grammatical as de jongfaam, but the
relationship between the two words is more intimate in the latter phrase,
giving it more the sense of referring to a specific, known person, a connotation
which the former phrase lacks.

"2.1.2.6. Breaking
The phenomenon known as breaking involves
(unbroken) and rising (broken) diphthongs:falling diphthong[ie]
[ra]therising diphthong[ju][je]alternationof fallingFrisian Reference Grammar18[ua]
[oa]PronunciationOnly one ‘regular’ verb, sliepe ‘sleep’, has breaking in its conjugation. The
relevant forms for this verb are:[wo]
[wa]There are some isolated cases of breaking of [ya] to [j@] - the related words
sluere and sljurkje, both meaning ‘(to) slide’ exhibit this, along with one or two
other examples. This is so rare that it will not be considered further.
As with shortening, to which it bears a certain resemblance, breaking is most
common in nouns, where the falling diphthong in the noun singular is replaced by
the corresponding rising diphthong in the diminutive or the plural:
doar[door]‘door’—hier{hior]‘hair’>foet[fust]‘foot?","[16, 17]"
"Notice that with all of these sentences the inflected verb is in second position and5.1.9. Adverbial order in simple sentencesIn place of an actual passive, Frisians often prefer to use impersonal active
constructions: se ite hjir in soad tsiis ‘they eat a lot of cheese here’.
Unlike English, sentences with an intransitive active verb and a human logical
subject (which need not be expressed) may also be passivized. In that case, der
generally occurs as a dummy in subject position:Most of the conditions on word order pertaining to nouns, adjectives, and verbs
are outlined in other sections. What concerns us here is the positions that adverbs
may occupy in the sentence. Since many prepositional phrases have an adverbial
function, they will be included in this discussion on adverbs.
It is useful to categorize adverbs into groups of those relating to time, manner,
and place. Below are examples of those (and prepositional phrases) belonging
to each group:all other verbs come at the end of the clause (i.e., the normal word order for
declarative sentences).der wurdt moarn meand ‘mowing will be done tomorrow’
der waard hjir altyd diinse ‘there was always dancing done here’
der wurdt hjoed wrotten ‘hard work is being done today’
In many ways these may be regarded as passive equivalents of sentences with the
indefinite pronoun jen ‘one, a person’ or se ‘they’: the indefinite se hawwe hiel
wat opiten ‘they ate quite a bit’ is quite similar semantically to der is hiel wat
opiten ‘there was quite a bit eaten’.
An important restriction on these impersonal passives is that they must co-occur
with verbs which can take an agent, although the agent is understood. For
instance, miene ‘think, be of the opinion’ is not a verb whose subject may be an
agent; therefore, *hjir wurdt wakker miend ‘much thinking is done here’ is not
a grammatical sentence.
Similar to the above are passive sentences which have existential der in subject
position, but which may also contain a subject (logical patient), indirect object,
or troch clause:der waarden twa minsken troch de soldaten deasketten
‘there were two people shot to death by the soldiers’
der sil moarn in hynder ferkocht wurde
‘there will be a horse sold tomorrow’
der binne trije skiep skeard (wurden)
‘three sheep have been shorn’
As usual in existential sentences (see sec. 5.1.2), the verb agrees with the surface
subject (the logical patient).
Various elements in this type of sentence may be preposed (sec. 5.1.3). When
this occurs, the preposed element displaces der, which is placed behind the verb.
The der may then sometimes be deleted: moarn wurdt (der) in hynder ferkocht,
etc., lock’: nei

(3) place: hjir ‘here’; nei Snits ta ‘to Snits’; yn Terherne ‘in Terherne’; this ‘athome’; oan ’e sleatswal ‘on the side of the ditch’; by és ‘at our house’.
The above scheme does not include all adverbs, omitting, for instance, thosewhich modify adjectives. Perhaps a simple way of determining which adverbs are
which is to note that those in (1) answer the question when, those in (2) the
question how, while those in (3) tell where.",[58]

When what is being relativized is an adverb of place (or a prepositional phrase
functioning as an adverbial), the relative pronoun is dér’t: oer dy brége leit de
pleats dér’t wy wenje ‘over that bridge lies the farm where we live’. The relative
pronoun represents the entire prepositional phrase yn dy pleats. Like where in
English, dér’t introduces only relative clauses that modify adverbials of place,
not nouns of place. Compare ver dy brége leit de pleats dy’t wy bewenje ‘over
that bridge lies the farm which we live in’, where the relative clause dy’t wy
bewenje modifies the noun phrase de pleats.

"4.1.2.1. Adjective inflection
When an adjective stands alone, most often as a predicate adjective, it has no
inflection:
dy hiin is ald

goed iten
goede lju
goede minsken
goede bieren“good milk’
“good beer’ (neuter)
“good food’ (neuter)
“good people’
“good people’
“good beers’ (neuter)The addition of a determiner complicates the situation somewhat. Leaving aside
a few exceptional cases for the moment, it is safe to say that any adjective which
modifies a common noun or any plural noun will be inflected, regardless of what
precedes it:
rike minsken
grutte huzen
goede wyn
de rike minsken‘the rich people’in goede wyn‘a good wine’‘rich people’
‘large houses’
“good wine’jimme
(ete.)~Yet when the determiner is it, dit, or dat, the adjective must be inflected:
-it
dit
dat‘that dog is old’
‘our house will remain green’With a noun phrase consisting only of an adjective plus noun, the adjective is
inflected (i.e., the suffix -e is added) before a common noun and is uninflected
before one which is neuter. In the plural it is always inflected:goede molke—‘a.(etc.) white sheep’wyt skiep[dit] wite skiep‘the (etc.) wite skiepThe general situation can be summarized by two rules:
(1)
(2)An adjective is inflected before a common noun and before any plural
noun.
An adjective is inflected before a neuter singular noun only when
preceded by it, dit, and dat; elsewhere it takes no ending.",[30]

may include or refer to the speaker: men moat altyd

(one) always have to do the dirty work’. Compare men
rydt yn Amearika yn
grutte autos ‘one drives big cars in America’, which
is appropriate if one is, in
actual fact, driving a big car in the United States. The
objective form of men is
Jin and the possessive is jins (predicative Jinnes), both
derived via breaking from
ien ‘one’: men kin der neat oan dwaan ‘you (one) can’t
do anything about it’;
men moat jin oan jins wurd halde ‘you must hold yourself
to your word’; soks
docht jin goed ‘such things do you a lot of good’; wat

the indefinite pronoun
as well: jo meie tsjintwurdich net hurder as hiindert
kilometer ride ‘you (one)
may not drive faster than one hundred kilometers (per
hour) these days’.

whether breaking does or does not apply. For example, it is impossible to tell
from the spelling of doarke ‘small door’ if the pronunciation should be [doerke]
or [dwarko]. It happens to be the latter. Yet a similar word, boarke ‘small drill’,
is never broken to [bwarke], but can only be pronounced [boerke].",[17]

"3.3. Some spelling rules
One of the most important rules of the Frisian spelling system is that, for the most
part, long vowels must be represented by a double letter in closed syllables. A
closed syllable is one which ends in a consonant, either as in sit or in sit-te. Thus
a long vowel like [e:] is doubled in reed, but is not in the plural redens, since this
word is divided into syllables as re-dens, and a single vowel in an open syllable
is assumed to be long.
Short vowels are indicated by the fact that they occur singly in orthographically
closed syllables - pet and petten, for example. Notice that this can lead to some
alternation in the spelling of related words, even when the pronunciation of the
stem remains the same:kat
pet
hoopje
wiid

consonant the presence of a broken, or rising diphthong:
soan

‘tone’ad
>soannen
toanen[swann]
[toonn]‘sons’
‘tones’4.1. The noun phraseYet this rule really only works with any consistency on plurals, since the
diminutives toantsje [toontsje] and soantsje [swantsja] are indistinguishable in
spelling. An exception to this is the broken variant of oe, which is spelled as uo
[wo], as in foet ‘foot’ + fuotten ‘feet’, and where even in the diminutive fuotsje
the presence of a broken diphthong is evident.
Furthermore,note that[u]and[u:], aswellas[y] and[y:] cannotbedifferentiated in the spelling. Similarly, i in an open syllable can represent either
long or short [i]: compare wide [vi:da] ‘wide’ with side [sido] ‘side’.

The sounds [y] and [y:], which can neverIn Frisian, a noun phrase may consist of a noun standing by itself, of oneor more

"1.3.3. The status of FrisianFor many of the years that Friesland has been part of The Netherlands, some
dialect of Dutch was the prestige language and Frisian was relegated to the
status of “farmers’ language.” As such it was used almost exclusively in the
home and in social gatherings in rural settings. In the schools, in church, in the
cities, and in most governmental offices the medium of communication was some
Dutch dialect. A person who spoke Frisian in such Dutch language domains was
not seen as making a statement that Frisian could be used in speaking to, for
example, a doctor, but was generally regarded as too ignorant or provincial to
speak Dutch to someone who obviously deserved more respect than to be
addressed in a peasants’ tongue.
While few would describe the situation in Friesland today in those terms, this
legacy of Frisian not being considered appropriate under certain circumstances
has survived as part of the consciousness of many Frisians. At the same time,
there have been significant strides made recently in expanding the domains in
which Frisian can be used. The increasing attention being paid to minority ethnic
groups and languages throughout Europe and the traditionally strong sense of
pride which most Frisians have fostered regarding their culture and their speech
have combined to breathe new life into the Frisian Movement during the past few
decades.
A study undertaken in 1980 sampled the language attitudes of a representative
group (some 1100) of the approximately one-half million inhabitants of the
province (Gorter et al., 1984). It was discovered that approximately 54% of the
respondents considered Frisian a first language. Some 73% claim to be able to
speak it, and 94% can understand it. The percentages of those who can read the
language (65%) and especially those who can write it (10%) are considerably
lower. It should be emphasized that this survey includes all of the province, even
those areas which have been essentially non-Frisian speaking for centuries.
In terms of language loyalty, it is interesting that 52% of those sampled speak
exclusively Frisian to a spouse/partner, and that another 4% speak both Frisian
and some Dutch dialect (Town Frisian, Standard Dutch, etc.). Approximately24% use Standard Dutch exclusively for this purpose, while 13% use a local
dialect (mainly Town Frisian or a Saxon dialect). Of those in the sample who
speak Frisian, only 60% speak it to a shopkeeper, and only 42% report that they
converse with the doctor in their first language. Apparently, some Frisians fear
that people of perceived higher social status (who are often a more mobile
segment of the population and therefore are less likely to work in their area of
birth) either will not understand Frisian or will find it impolite to be addressed
in the local language.the curriculum of all Frisian schools for approximately one hour a week. Many
regional governmental bodies in the province have begun to include knowledge
of Frisian as one of the qualifications for employment as a civil servant, a radical
departure from former practices.
Meanwhile, the Estates of Friesland have begun to take a more active andpositive role in Frisian affairs. And the Fryske Akademy (Frisian Academy) in
Ljouwert continues its work in promoting and investigating all aspects of Frisian
language and culture. Perhaps its most ambitious project to date is the compilation of a multi-volume dictionary, intended as an exhaustive listing of all the
lexical items of modern West Frisian. The Frisian programs of the Dutch
universities (in Amsterdam, Leiden, and Groningen) also contribute a great deal
to furthering our knowledge about both old and modern Frisian.
No one can predict with any certainty what will become of languages like
Frisian in the next few centuries, or for that matter, whether even more established languages like Danish or Dutch will be able to withstand sociological
factors — increased population mobility and the spread of mass communication,
for instance — which militate against the survival of smaller languages. At the
same time, the value of maintaining one’s culture, in which the preservation ofthe language plays a pivotal role, is being increasingly recognized, especially in
those parts of the world which through modernization and industrialization have
lost much of what once rendered them distinct from others. In the final analysis,
to maintain one’s identity as a Frisian, one must speak Frisian. And to understand the Frisians, one must first understand their language.
NOTE: For further information on the sociolinguistic status of Frisian, see Pietersen (1969),
Smith (1980), Boelens (1976), Boelens et al. (1981), Feitsma (1981), Gorter (1981), Gorter
et al. (1984), and various articles in Zondag (1982). A follow-up of the language survey of
Gorter et al. (1984) is Gorter and Jonkman (1995). For a critical evaluation of the results, seeDe Haan (1996b).",[11]
"4.2.4.4. Use of the tenses
Some of the tenses in Frisian are used in different ways from their English
counterparts, and thus require some comment here. Any Frisian verb tense, first
of all, may also be translated as a progressive in English (in the appropriate
context, of course): ik mean may mean either ‘I mow’ (which in English implies
that it is a repeated or habitual act) or ‘Iam mowing’ (i.e., something being done
is
right now). In order to emphasize in Frisian that the action is in progress, it

work’. Often the present perfect is used to relate isolated
ik ha dy man ferline wike sjoen ‘I saw that man last week’; hawwe jimme juster
yn Ljouwert west? ‘were you in Ljouwert yesterday?’
Because the future is often expressed through the present tense, the true future
with sille takes on a more emphatic connotation: compare ik gean fan ’e middei
de stéd yn ‘I’m going into town this afternoon’ with ik sil fan ’e middei de stéd
yn (gean), which is more emphatic.
The past perfect tense may be used in the same way that it is in English: ik hie
noch net sketten ‘I hadn’t shot yet’ or (with verbs which take the auxiliary wéze)
se wienen al fuortgongen ‘they had gone already’. Beyond this, the past perfect
may express certain types of counterfactual statements: Jelle hie soks noait dien
‘Jelle would never have done something like that’ (essentially the same as the past
conditional Jelle soe soks noait dien hawwe). Compare also ik wie om twa oerethiiskommen ‘I would have come home at two o’clock’ or ‘I had come home at
two o’clock’, the meaning depending on the context.
The above are similar to the counter-to-fact statements made with the preterite
or preterite form of the auxiliary (see sec. 5.4.1), such as wie hy mar thiskommen
“if he had but come home’ or wie se mar op har keamer ‘if only she were in her-Frisian Reference Grammarroom’.","[43, 44]"

(indicates an impossible form or sentence)(indicates a questionable form or sentence)Frisian is one of a number of Germanic languages, a family which also includes
English, German, Dutch, Afrikaans, Norwegian, Danish, Faroese, Swedish, and
Icelandic. Of these languages, the last five comprise what are known as the
Scandinavian (or North Germanic) languages, while those remaining are
classified as West Germanic. Dutch, Afrikaans, and German are closely related,
just as the relationship between English and Frisian is, at least in historical
terms, a close one.
Frisian, which is thus the living language most similar to English, is spoken
in three main areas in The Netherlands and in Germany. Some ten thousand
speakers of North Frisian live on the western coast of Schleswig-Holstein in
Germany just beneath the Danish border. This region includes the environs of
Naibel (Ger. Niebiill) and much of the rest of the area north of Braist
(Bredstedt), as well as the islands of Sél (Sylt), Feer (Féhr), Oomram (Amrum)and Deat Lun (Helgoland). (Note: throughout this book names of Frisian places
are given in Frisian). The dialects spoken in these areas differ substantially from
the other varieties of Frisian and also among themselves, to the extent that
speakers from one region often cannot understand those from another. At this
time virtually all varieties of North Frisian are severely threatened by German,
although perhaps in part on account of this threat, there is increased appreciation
of the cultural value which the survival of this language offers its speakers.
In a different region of Germany, located between the city of Oldenburg and
the Dutch frontier, is the last remaining pocket of speakers of East Frisian. Real
East Frisian should not to be confused with a type of Low German called
Ostfriesisch. The real East Frisian was once extensively spoken throughout the
countryside of what is known as Ostfriesland. Its use receded until the last
speakers of the East Frisian Island dialect of Wangerooge died at the beginning
of this century, leaving the inhabitants of Saterland as the only representatives
of this variety of the language. In the villages of Schiddel (Ger. Scharrel),
Strukelje (Striicklingen), and Roomelse (Ramsloh), some one to two thousand
souls use East Frisian (Seeltersk) for their daily communicative needs.
This grammar will describe West Frisian, the language of three to four
hundred thousand residents of the province of Fryslan in The Netherlands. The
Dutch province of Groningen and the uppermost portion of the province of North
Holland (still referred to locally as Westfriesland) were also heavily Frisianspeaking at one time, but the language has been displaced there by various
Netherlandic dialects and, more recently, by Standard Dutch (Algemeen
Nederlands).","[7, 8]"
"5.3.1. Coordination5.3.1.1. Sentence coordination
The most basic way to connect simple sentences into a larger whole is by means
of coordinating conjunctions like en, mar, of, dus, want, etc.:de brége wie stikken, dus ik koe net fierder gean
‘the bridge was broken, so I could go no further’
wy wenje al tweintich jier yn Austraalje, mar prate noch altyd Frysk
‘we have been living in Australia for twenty years, but still speak Frisian’
mem moat molke keapje en Jitske wol in kammeraatske opsykje
‘mom has to buy milk, and Jitske wants to look up a girlfriend’
ik bin wat let, want ik hie in lekke ban‘I am a bit late, because I had a flat tire’Coordination essentially joins two independent sentences, hence the word order
of the conjuncts does not change.
Not uncommon in Frisian is to have a period (phonetically, a pause) between
two conjoined sentences, with the result that a coordinating conjunction may begin
a sentence. The following are some such sentences from De Siinde fan Haitze
Holwerda by U. van Houten:
Dat de boer mocht ris oer it skouder sizze...
‘So the farmer would say over his shoulder...’
Mar sa mocht men ek wer net!
‘But that was also not permissible!’
Want hy mocht dan syn lekken en brekken hawwe...
‘For he may have had his faults...’
En hja wisten him te finen as der eat dien wurde moast
‘And they knew where to find him if something needed to be done’
Ineach of these cases, the conjunction must act as a transition from a previously
expressed sentence or theme without physically connecting the sentences.
Information in the second conjunct which is a repetition of that in the first may
often be deleted. For instance, when the subjects of two conjuncts are co-referential, it is only expressed in the first (material which may be deleted is listedin parentheses):110Frisian Reference GrammarJan arbeide oerdeis yn in fabryk en (Jan) learde jiins
Jan worked by day in a factory and studied at night’Identical verbs may also be deleted, with or without the subject:
ik yt sop en Gerrit (yt) grauwe earten‘I eat soup and Gerrit (eats) marrowfat peas’
Geartsje laket te folle en Durk (laket) te min
*Geartsje laughs too much and Durk (laughs) too little’
juster lake ik te folle en hjoed (laitsje ik) te min
‘yesterday I laughed too much and today (I laugh) too little’
Notice that in each case the same verb must be involved, but not necessarily in
the same form. In linguistic terminology the deletion of identical verbs in
conjoined structures is called gapping. This process also applies with more
complex verb phrases:ik ha net in skiep sjoen, mar (ik ha) in hin (sjoen)
‘I didn’t see a sheep, but (I saw) a dog’
hawwe jo in appel keazen, of (hawwe jo) in par (keazen)?
‘did you choose an apple or (did you choose) a pear?’
It needs to be mentioned that gapping — the deletion of the verb and, when they
are identical, its complements and modifiers — may take place only when some
element following the verb is left standing (hence the name gapping). For
instance, Durk drinkt hjoed bearenburch en Jan drinkt hjoed bearenburch
cannot be reduced by gapping to *Durk drinkt hjoed bearenburch en Jan, since
nothing which followed the verb in the second conjunct remains; the entire
predicate has been deleted. But Durk drinkt hjoed bearenburch en Jan jenever
is well-formed. Often the adverbs al, wol, ek, and net suffice for the purpose of
leaving some element of the VP behind:ik sil nei de film ta, en hy ek
‘I'll go to the movies, and he will, too’
mem wol hjoed fervje, mar heit net
‘mother wants to paint today, but father does not’
Toppenhuzen hat gjin swimbad, mar Snits al
“Toppenhuzen has no swimming pool, but Snits does’
de hiele hishdlding sil nei Braban, dus Sikke ek
‘the whole family will go to Brabant, thus Sikke will also’
Durk drinkt bearenburch en Jan ek
“Durk drinks bearenburch and Jan does also’
Conjoined sentences with multiple objects may become ambiguous when deletion
occurs: Jetze joech mem in tit en heit in han may mean ‘Jetze gave moma kiss
and he gave dad a handshake’ or ‘Jetze gave mom a kiss and dad gave her a
handshake’. The ambiguity rests in the fact that once the verb is deleted, it is noSyntax11longer possible to determine the function of each NP from its position relative tothe verb.
The conjunction want does not allow for deletion, as a rule. Compare hja yt de
beantsjes op en ik de woartels ‘she eats up the beans and I the carrots’ with the
ungrammatical *hja yt de beantsjes op want ik de woartels. Correct here is hja
yt de beantsjes op want ik yt de woartels op ‘she cats up the beans becauseI eat
up the carrots’. Even identical subjects cannot be deleted: *Sytse soe nei de winkel
want moast wat keapje is ungrammatical without a subject hy in the second
conjunct.
5.3.1.2. Phrasal coordination
Closely related to the above (and sometimes considered derived fromit) is phrasalcoordination, where two separate constituents (not clauses) are conjoined by a
conjunction into one larger constituent of the same category. Thus the two nouns
Jan and Pyt may be joined into one larger constituent Jan en Pyt, which acts like
a plural noun. The sentences which have such phrasal conjunction must be considered, at least at the surface level, to be simple rather than complex. Compare
the conjoined (and reduced) sentences ik ha in skiep sjoen en in hin and hawwe
jo in appel iten of in par? with the examples of phrasal conjunction below:
ik ha in skiep en in hin sjoen ‘I saw a sheep and a dog’
hawwe jo in appel of in par iten? ‘did you eat an apple or a pear?’
Similar is the common process in Frisian by which derivational prefixes, verb
particles, or first elements of compounds are conjoined and reduced. Again, the
material which may be omitted is placed in parentheses:
op(geande) en delgeande twaliiden
‘rising and falling diphthongs’
de foar(dielen) en neidielen fan dit projekt
‘the advantages and disadvantages of this project’
is it dy ta(fallen) of offallen?
‘was it better than you expected or worse?’
se kin sawol piano(spylje) as gitaarspylje
‘she can play the piano as well as the guitar’
dit binne tis pake(sizzers) en beppesizzers‘these are our grandchildren (grandfather-sayers and grandmother-sayers)’
meane jo hjir(mei) of dérmei?
‘are you mowing with this or with that?’Incontrast with most other types of deletion, here material before the conjunction
is deleted. In writing, the deleted word is usually indicated by a hyphen:
is it in op- of @ndergeande sinne? ‘is it a rising or setting sun?’11zFrisian Reference Grammar5.3.2. Subordination
Subordinate clauses in Frisian have several characteristics:(1) they are introduced by a subordinating conjunction, most of which are listed
in sec. 4.7.2;
(2) they have dependent clause word order, with the finite verb (V1) at the end
of the clause, following any non-finite verbs (V2);
(3) the subordinating conjunction is almost invariably followed by dat or oft or
the reduced form ’t.
Below are some sentences that illustrate subordination; in each case, the mainclause is followed by a subordinate clause:Aukje siet te eameljen, wylst Brechtsje it wurk die
‘Aukje sat chattering while Brechtsje did the work’
Haitse gong werom, omdat it min waar wie
‘Haitse turned back because it was bad weather’
wy wiene klear, nei’t wy tis lessen leard hienen
‘we were finished after we had done our homework’The dependent clauses are introduced here by the subordinating conjunctionswylst, omdat, and nei’t, and the finite verb (die, wie, and hienen) occurs at the
end of the clause, following the non-finite verbs (V2), if there are any. As wasmentioned in sec. 4.7.2, the subordinating conjunction is almost always followed
by dat ‘that’, oft, or the reduced form ’t. This ’t does not appear when the
conjunction ends in t, however. An overview of the order of verbs in subordinate
clauses is given in sec. 5.5.2.
Some subordinate clauses function like sentential adverbs (introduced by no’t,
doe’t, wylst, om’t, etc.). They enjoy much the same freedom of movement as other
adverbs, and may thus be placed at the beginning of the independent sentence or
at various places internally. When a subordinate clause opens a sentence (as in
the first example below), it functions as the first element, causing the subject to
be moved to directly behind the verb:doe’t Hinke yn ’e auto stapte, riin de motor al
‘when Hinke stepped into the car, the motor was already running’
it seil moat makke wurde foar’t wy moarn sile
‘the sail must be repaired before we sail tomorrow’
hy fertelde, om’t er der net foarwei koe, de wierheid
‘he told, because he could not get out of it, the truth’.
5.3.3. Complementation and nominalization
5.3.3.1. The complementizer ‘dat’
A sentence may function as a subject or object of a main verb. Independent
clauses like ik leau it ‘I believe it’, jo witte it ‘you know it’, or hja sizze it ‘they113Syntaxsay it’, all of which may take it (or some similar pronoun) asa complement, may
also have an entire sentence as a direct object. The object sentence either has no
complementizerandindependentwordorder,orit is a subordinateclauseintroduced by dat:
ik leau, hy wint it moarn or:ik leau dat er it moarn wint ‘I believe that he will win tomorrow
Pyt yt gjin biter or:
jo witte,
te witte Ee Pyt ajin biiter yt ‘you know that Pete doesn’t eat butter’
hja sizze, der hat in man op ’e moanne wenne or:
hja sizze dat der in man op ’e moanne wenne hat
‘they say that a man used to live on the moon
Like a simple noun, a sentential complement may be moved to the front of the
sentence for emphasis:
_
dat Pyt gjin biter yt, witte jo al lang
time
long
a
for
known
‘that Pete eats no butter you have
A clause introduced by dat may also function as subject of a sentence:
dat dy jongkeardel studint is, fernuvert my
‘that that young man is a student, puzzles me’
dat se hjir gjin harken ferkeapje, is wat frjemd
‘that they don’t sell any rakes here is somewhat strange
dat Wytske gjin sinten hie, die juster bliken
‘that Wytske had no money became evident yesterday
By means of what is called extraposition, an it (which functions as a dummy)
may be placed in the subject position and the subordinate clause moves tothe end.
This occurs mainly when the dat clause is the underlying subject:
it fernuvert my dat dy jongkeardel studint is
it is wat frjemd dat se hjir gjin harken ferkeapje
it die juster bliken dat Wytske gjin sinten hieThe sentential complement of some verbs can only appear in extraposed form,
like lykje ‘appear, seem’: compare it liket dat er heas is ‘it seems that he is
hoarse’ with the ungrammatical *dat er heas is, liket. Sentences of this type (with
lykje ‘seem’ , skine ‘appear’, or blike ‘turn out’) may additionally be expressed

I convinced him (of it) that he could better stay in bed’
Boate wiisde derop, dat it no al te let wie‘Boate pointed out that it was now already too late’
This is generally a property of verbs which are conventionally associated with
a particular preposition, as are wize op ‘point out’ and vertsjiigje fan ‘convince’.
NOTE: When the main verb of the sentence denotes a feeling, statement, or observation, and
when it is a positive, factual sentence (without negation or modals in the matrix sentence)
dat may optionally be followed by main clause word order:ik sei dat er my sjoen hie
or: ik sei dat hy hie my sjoen ‘I said that he had seen me’
ik leau dat se har wol réde kin
or: ik leau dat se kin har wol réde ‘I believe that she can handle it’Contrast the ungrammatical *ik leau net dat se kin har wol réde. This is a different dat from
that which means ‘so, therefore’ (sec. 4.7.2), which also is followed by independent word
order. On dependent clauses with independent word order, see further De Haan (1983, 1990a)

like:NOTE: In choosing the proper diminutive suffix, there
is some vascillation between -ke and
-tsje with certain words. Following /, t, and nit is possible
to have -keas a diminutive marker,
but these involve largely fossilized constructions, especial
ly names: holke ‘small head’; Tetke
(name); Hylke (name). Words ending in vowels traditio
nally take -ke, but more recentlyborrowed words quite often take -tsje: autootsje ‘small car’;Breuker (1982) and Hoekema (1958).kadootsje ‘small gift’. See alsoDiminutives can be formed for almost any concrete, counta

are most words for periods of time (dei, wike, moanne,
etc.) and money (giine,
Sint, etc.), which form diminutives less readily. In their
most basic sense, diminutivesgnize

fistSince diminution is such a productive process, the meanin
g of the diminutive
seldom deviates from that of the stem - fearke is simply
a small fear ‘feather’,
At times, though, the diminutive can have a signification
which the stem lacks.
Hiiske, for instance, refers not merely toa little house, but
to an outhouse or toilet.
Kaartsje ‘ticket’ is different from kaart ‘map’, and a muiske
‘jokester’ is more
than a small mouse. In some instances there are two diminu
tives which have been
formed
from the same stem (doublets): compare muske with
miske ‘small mouse’and hiske ‘toilet’ with hiske ‘small house’. Diminutives
are in a few cases based
on words other than nouns, as are the egg-seeker’s terms
formed from numbers:
ientsje ‘nest with one egg’, and twake ‘two eggs in
a nest’, trijke ‘three eggs in
a nest’.
NOTE: Diminutives can also be based on non-cou
ntable nouns (ark ‘tools’ - arkje ‘tool,
instrument’), adjectives (sleau ‘dull’ - sleauke ‘dull girl’),
adverbials (foar iten ‘before dinner’
- foaritentsje ‘aperitif’ ) and verbs (fertelle ‘tell’ - fertelts
je ‘story’). For these extensions of

"yuF. risian Reference Grammarorder. In that case the conjunction morpheme is never expressed.
The following are the main subordinating conjunctions in Frisian
:
as ‘if, as if, as’: it wie krekt as soe se oerein gean ‘it was
just as if she were
going to stand up’; hy die as hied er it net murken ‘he acted
as if he hadn’t
noticed it’. In this usage, as is followed by independent word
order (verbs
soe and hie in second position in the clause). Notice
that there is
subject-verb inversion after as. It is also possible to have
as followed by
oft in this sense, in which case dependent clause word
order is required:
it wie krekt as oft se oerein gean soe (the verb soe is at the
end). As is used
like English in expressions of the kind as Skipper
‘as skipper’.
Furthermore, as is utilized to express comparison (sec.
4.1.2.4). In colloquial language, one sometimes hears as as a coordinating
conjunction
in place of of: wolle jo molke as net ‘do you want milk or
not?’
As is often used in the sense of ‘if’ in sentences like as
it net kin sa’t it
moat, dan moat it mar sa’t it kin ‘if it can’t be done
as it must, then itmust be done as well as it can’. This use of as is, at least
in the spoken
language, often replaced by at.
at ‘if’: at means ‘if’ in conditional sentences like at ik
thits west hie, wie dit
noait bard ‘if I had been at home, this would never have
happened’; at
Thea werom komt tit Braban, dan krijt se fan my in tit
‘if Thea comes
back from Brabant, she’ll get a kiss from me’. In this
sense as is also
possible; indeed, it may be preferred in formal styles.
At may also
sometimes be used instead of oft (see below).
NOTE: Until recently, the conjunction at was seldom
written, as and oft being penned instead.
Recently, however, at has been gaining increasing accepta
nce, especially for conditional as,
although many conservative writers who say at still
shun it in favor of as or oft in script. Theproblem has at least two dimensions. One is that many olderFrisians write oft where they sayat - both of these words are pronounced {ot]. The other
is that ar appears to be displacing as
in certain types of sentences, although this trend is
also resisted by many writers.dat ‘that, so that, so’: when followed by independent
word order, dat can
generally be translated by ‘so’: hy moast nei skoalle
, dat hy helle de fyts
Ut it hok ‘he had to go to school, so he got the bike out of
the shed’; dar,
do bist Jildert ‘So you are Jildert’. As with coordinating conjun
ctions like
dus, which is similar in meaning to this use of dat, the
clitics er and -sto
do not occur after dat when independent word order
follows. With
dependent word order, dat may mean ‘so that’: se fytste
hurd dat se net
de léste wéze soe ‘she cycled fast so that she wouldn’t be the
last one’. Dat
is used in exclamatory sentences like hyt dat it wie! ‘hot
that it was!’ or
sile dat se koe ‘sail that she could, how she could sail’. The
use of dat as
a complementizer is the topic of sec. 5.3.3.1 and its use
as a relative

"2.2.2.2. Syllabification
As a rule, a vowel is a necessary element in any syllable. It is possible, however,
for certain consonants to carry a syllable when the vowel is deleted. This occurs
in most dialects of English, as in words like button [btn], bottle [bot]], and center[op ti][senty], where the vowel of the last syllable has been deleted and its function of
carrying the syllable transferred to the final liquid or nasal. This final liquid or
nasal has come to be syllabic, as indicated in the phonetic transcription by the
mark under the letter.
In an analogous manner, when a schwa in Frisian is followed in the same[net tot]syllable by an /, r, m, n, or ng, the schwa[yt tut]

by a word which begins with any voiced consonant or vowel:
baas die

thiis wéze
misdied[vie za][bagd bo:le]Obviously, assimilation will not occur if there is a pause separating the two words.
A relatively systematic exception to the above generalization is found when the
second element (the voiced consonant) is a d in various pronouns or function
words, including dit, dat, dizze, dy, do, dyn, dij, doe, dan, dére, der, and dus.
When one of these follows a word terminating in a voiceless stop, both often
become voiceless:op dy25[vz in][ov yt][sjoy ion]Only unstressed syllables are subject to syllabification. Syllabification and assimilation are less common after stems ending in [y], however: eagen ‘eyes’ [tayon].
The en suffix used to mark the plural and sometimes the past participle is also
syllabified in all but the most formal speech. This syllabic n, which hence oftenAnother exception to voicing assimilation is that the s of se, a reduced form ofcomes to stand directly after another consonant, will normally assimilate to the‘she’, which as a voiceless fricative should not be subject to assimilation initially,place of articulation of that consonant (cf. sec. 2.2.2.1):26Frisian Reference Grammarhappen

words with an internal word boundary.[riny]NOTE: Though it is a very old process in Dutch and German, records indicate that final
devoicing in Frisian is a phenomenon of recent origin. In the phonetic study of the languageNOTE: Nasalization, syllabification, and assimilation can interact in rather complex ways. For
instance, fekenst ‘(you) draw’ can either undergo nasalization to [te:kdst], or the n can be
syllabified and assimilate to the preceding consonant, producing [te:ky st], either one of whichof Grou by Eijkman (1907:19), b and d are said to be largely voiced at the end of a word. But
in Sipma’s grammar (1913), there are signs that devoicing has started to set in. His
transciptions, although not entirely consistent, suggest that devoicing had taken place following
long vowels, falling diphthongs, and liquids, but not after short vowels or rising diphthongs.is acceptable Frisian. Or look at the suffix -ens, which normally is nasalized, as in smoargens
[smwaryés] ‘dirt’. But following a dental consonant, the en may be syllabified rather than
nasalized, as we see in wissens [visps] ‘certainty’, alongside [visds]. The nature of the consonant directly following is also of some importance. The complicated interplay of these
processes is the topic of Riemersma (1979). Syllabification is further discussed in Dyk (1987)
and Visser (1997, Ch. 6). On the historical development of this phenomenon in Frisian, seeVan der Kuip (1987),2.2.2.3. Final devoicing
The voiced obstruents [b d y v z] cannot occur at the end of a word in Frisian.","[20, 21]"
"5.1.1. Basic sentence structureThe simplest sentence may have only a subject and a verb:
ik libje ‘1 live’
Piter sykhellet ‘Peter breathes’Copular verbs like wéze ‘be’ and bliuwe ‘stay’ may be followed by predicate
adjectives (always without inflection) or predicate nominatives:Andrys is in goede keatser ‘Andrys is a good keats player’
it gers wie giel ‘the grass was yellow’
tis heit bliuwt advokaat ‘our father will remain a lawyer
NOTE: When the predicate nominative lists an occupation, the indefinite article in does not
normally appear: Durk is boer ‘Durk is a farmer’. But when an adjective modifies the noun,an article is required: Durk is in minne boer ‘Durk is a bad farmer’. Furthermore, when the
predicate nominative does not as much list an occupation as it states an opinion of sorts {wherethe occupation is used figuratively), in is usually present: Durk is in boer ‘Durk is a boor’.
verbwaeaephrases include not only the main verb, but auxiliary verbs like wéze,etc. The verbs which are inflected for person and number are calledfinite verbs, referred to here as V1. The other verbs within the sentence occur innon-finite form (as infinitives and participles, for example), and are referred to
here as V2. The basic rule in the declarative sentence is that the V1, of whicheachsimple sentence has only one, is always in second position in the sentence and that
the V2 is at the end:ik sjoch har ‘I see her’
ik ha har sjoen ‘I have seen her’Syntax5.1.2. Existential sentences with ‘der’ik sil har sjoen hawwe ‘] will have seen her’Notice that when the main verb stands alone, it occurs in

bumped”, as it were, to final place in the sentence. The verb hawwe is always
followed bya verb in the past participle form, so sjoch becomes sjoen ‘seen’. And
when sille ‘will’ is added in the third example sentence, it occurs in inflected form
in second position. The verb associated with modals like sille is usually in the
infinitive form, so the infinitive hawwe is placed at the end of the V2,sjoen, to create ik sil har sjoen hawwe.behindNOTE: For further details on the verb-second constraint, see sec. 5.1.3.","[54, 55]"

"2.1.2.3. The diphthong [a:i]
Many older speakers still make a systematic distinction between the long
diphthong [a:i] and the shorter [ai]. There is thus an opposition, reflected in the
spelling, between dei [dai] ‘day’ and daai (da:i] ‘dough’, as well as between kleie
[klaia] ‘complain’ and klaaie [kla:ia] ‘dress’. Also, the long diphthong can be
shortened under the appropriate circumstances: [a:i] ‘egg’ becomes short in [aiko]
‘small egg’ and in [aisikja] ‘hunt for eggs’ (for details see sec. 2.1.2.5).hikje
hikken

‘small bottle’
‘bottles’Truncation also takes place when other suffixes are added to nouns ending in
schwa, as when -ich is suffixed to sinne, producing sinnich ‘sunny’.
With noun compounds there is no hard and fast rule. Sometimes the final vowel
is retained, as in sinnebril ‘sunglasses’ and in sinneljocht ‘sunlight’. Other times
it is deleted, as the forms sydpaad ‘side path’ and sydstrjitte ‘side street’ (from
side) attest. A few words admit both possibilities - either hikpeal or hikkepeal is
permissible for ‘gatepost’ (from hikke ‘gate’ and peal ‘post’). This is a lexical
matter which must be determined by looking in a dictionary.
In conversational styles of speech, final schwa is also truncated quite frequently, especially in rapid speech. This is an optional process, for it is never
required that the vowel be dropped. Truncation of this kind occurs most often
when a verb that ends in a schwa is directly followed by a vowel, as in wy binn(e)
altyd this ‘we are always home’ or wy witt(e) alles oer syn mem ‘we know
everything about his mother’. Before consonants it can also happen: jimmm(e)it(e)wol ris te folle “you sometimes eat too much’. Notice that the pronoun jimme can
undergo truncation, as can nouns: hoe let giet de sinn(e) op? ‘what time does the
sun rise?’ Nonetheless, optional truncation is most common with verbs in rapid
speech. Schwa is never truncated before a pause, except that jimmne ‘you’ can
sometimes occur as jim, in which case it is better considered an independent
variant of jimme.",[15]
"5.2.2. Specification questions
Unlike alternative questions, specification questions ask for information without
presenting two alternatives or choices to the hearer. The question words used for
this purpose are listed in section 4.6; they generally are placed at the very
beginning of the sentence, although a coordinating conjunction may precede. TheSyntax107verb comes in second position, followed by the subject, if there is one:a
wér wenje jo? ‘where do you live?’
child?’ this
is
old
‘how
berntsje?
hoe Ald is dit
in the living room?’
sitting
‘who’s
?
foarkeamer
’e
yn
wa sit
wat leit hjir op ’e griin? ‘what is lying on the ground here?
dus wannear sile wy? ‘so when do we go sailing?’
wat ytsto? ‘what are you eating?’
When the question word is in a prepositional phrase, the entire phrase may be
fronted (pied piping) or the object of the preposition may be preposed, leaving
the preposition behind (preposition stranding):
mei hokker famke hast praat? ‘with which girl have you spoken?”
hokker famke hast mei praat? ‘which girl have you spoken with?
As mentioned in section 4.5, when the object of the preposition is wat, expressions
like wérmei ‘with what’ take the place of the expected *mei wat. These
expressions do not normally undergo pied piping, but are preferably split in
normal discourse. Some examples:wér moat ik dit blikje mei iepen meitsje?
‘with what should I open this tin can?’
wér komt soks fan?
‘from what do such things come?’
long with the
isi wa, iti may be fronted along
ition
of the preposition
j
When the object
preposition or, alternatively, the preposition may be stranded. In the latter case
it is quite often replaced by wér:njonken wa hast justerjiin sitten?
‘next to whom did you sit yesterday evening?’
wa hast justerjtin njonken sitten?
wer hast justerjiin njonken sitten?
The answer to a question regarding wérmei may be dérmei ‘with that’ or hjirmei
‘with this’. The constraints which operate with constructions like wérmei are also,
roughly speaking, valid for dérmei, hjirmei, etc., when they come to stand at the
beginning of a sentence (usually for emphasis); i.e. they are usually split:ik sil it dérmei besykje ‘I will try it with that’
or: dér sil ik it mei besykje
NOTE: On preposition stranding in Frisian, see Hoekema (1955), Wadman ( 1989), and
Hoekstra (1995). The near-obligatory splitting of adverbial pronouns like dérmei, etc. is
discussed in Hoekstra (1994b).",[61]

peirticiple67NOTE: The principal parts of strong or irregular verbs are, not surprisingly, subject toa greatdeal of dialectal and idiolectal variation. What is interesting is that when such changes take
place with verbs which belong to rime groups, more often than not the entire rime group
changes. Sprekke, for example, has the principal parts sprekke-spruts-sprutsen for many
Frisians. But the speaker who has the pret. spruts will probably also have similarly-formedpreterites for the remaining words in this rime group; ¢.g., bruts (from brekke) and stuts (fromstekke), etc. The importance of rime in this aspect of the language is thus quite clear.
Putting aside traditional classifications of the verb system, there are really only two classesof verbs in Frisian, based on the personal endings in the present tense: class I, which includeswhat are traditionally called class I weak verbs and the strong verbs, and class II. The former
are verbs which end in -e in the infinitive and the latter end in -je. Both of these classes can
have regular verbs which go according to the patterns listed in the previous sections, or they
may be irregular. Thus hingje-hong-hongen ‘hang’ and bergje-burch-burgen ‘hide’ are
examples of irregular verbs which take class II personal endings but in other ways act like
what are traditionally called strong verbs. This two-way division seems to make much moresense in terms of how the language really works.
The strong verbs traditionally have an -en suffix in the past participle. Often the -en is nolonger transparent in today’s language: bain ‘bound’; sjoen ‘seen’, dien ‘done’. Because theending is not transparent anymore, many speakers add a -d (phonetically the marker of thepast participle in class I verbs) to forms of this nature: bind, sjoend, diend, etc. This is
especially common in certain areas to the west of the province.",[41]
"4Frisian Reference GrammarIntroduction51.3. West Frisian1.3.2. Standard Frisian1.3.1. The West Frisian dialectsThe vast majority of the languages of the world do not possess a “standard”
variety. Rather, the most common situation, which once held also for now
well-established languages like French, English, and Dutch, is when a language
is divided into a number of dialects, none of which is considered superior to the
others. This was essentially the state of affairs in The Netherlands during the
Middle Ages, for example. Several Germanic dialects were in use at the time,
and the few people who were literate in the vernacular wrote essentially as they
spoke. This situation began to change as the region of Holland consolidated its
influence over the surrounding areas. The language of Holland thus came to be
increasingly used in administration and trade throughout The Netherlands,
especially after the Union of Utrecht in 1579. This led to its being recognized asWest Frisian is spoken throughout the province of Fryslan, with the exception
of the following areas. It is traditionally not spoken in It Bilt (Dutch Het Bildt),
an area which was reclaimed from the sea in the sixteenth century and was
subsequently settled by Dutch farmers. The people in It Bilt now speak a dialect
of Dutch with a number of Frisian characteristics. Furthermore,in the Stel-lingwerven, a narrow strip of land between the river Tsjonger (Dutch Kuinder)
and the province of Drenthe, as well as in the area around Kollum in the northeast corner of the province, Saxon dialects are spoken, albeit with varying
measures of Frisian influence.
As Frisian ceased to be the official language in the sixteenth century, the
language of government and commerce increasingly became Dutch, a trend
which only recently has begun to swing back to Frisian in a limited number of
domains. Government and trade being largely the prerogative of the cities, it
came about that the residents of the larger towns developed dialects based on
Dutch, although heavily influenced by Frisian. These dialects, called Stedfrysk
or “Town Frisian”, are today spoken in the cities of Ljouwert (Leeuwarden),
Snits (Sneek), Dokkum, Frjentsjer (Franeker), Boalsert (Bolsward), Harns
(Harlingen), Starum (Stavoren), and in the village of Kollum. Many of these
“mixed” dialects are being supplanted by Standard Dutch at present.
Of the four Frisian islands, the language is indigenous today to Skiermfintseach (Schiermonnikoog) and Skylge (Terschelling). Each of these islands must
be considered a separate speech area, for their dialects differ significantly not
only from those on the mainland,but also from one another. All the islanddialects are severely threatened by Dutch. The island of Amelin (Ameland) has
long had a Dutch dialect with Frisian influence.
The mainland itself forms a much more homogeneous speech community. One
fairly divergent dialect, showing certain similarities with the speech of the
islands, is that of Hylpen (Hindeloopen). The surrounding land, the southernmost part of the province known as the Stidwesthoeke, is one of the major dialect
areas of mainland Frisian, although its speech is easily understood by others. It
is distinguished from Klaaifrysk, spoken roughly in the western half of the
province, and Wdildfrysk, the language of the eastern section, largely by the
absence of the phonological process of breaking (see section 2.1.2.6). One of the
most salient features identifying speakers of W4ldfrysk is that they pronounce
pronouns such as hy (Klaaifrysk: [hei]) ‘he’ and my (Klaaifrysk: [mei]) ‘me’ as
[hi] and [mi], respectively. A subgrouping of Klaaifrysk is the Noardklaai
dialect of the area known as the Dongeradielen.
NOTE: On the dialects of West Frisian, see Boelens and Van der Woude (1955) and Hof
(1933).the standard dialect of all of The Netherlands, making it the medium of theschools, churches, and of government. Similar scenarios describe the development of many other standard languages. In a linguistic sense, then, a language
is simply a group of closely related dialects. One of these dialects, often that
spoken by the largest number of speakers or by those having the greatest power,
is accepted by all other speakers, or is forced upon them, as a ‘standard’.
While leery of the inherent pressure towards homogeneity which the development of a standard language entails, Frisian scholars and activists, in part
because of a need for an interregional variety of the language to be used for
writing, in bilingual education, in schools, and to be taught to interested nonFrisians, developed a literary language which is based largely on the Klaaifrysk
dialects. As with other such languages, Standard Frisian is quite conservative in
nature, often resisting the use of Dutch loanwords long after they are firmly
entrenched in spoken Frisian. But in view of the ease with which Dutch words
are accepted into Frisian, sometimes supplanting very basic vocabulary items,
these purist tendencies are certainly understandable.
Because Dutch remains the predominant language of church, state, and most
importantly, of education, Standard Frisian has had limited opportunities to
make significant advances. If anything, the “watering down” of Frisian through
the acceptance of ever more Dutch elements into the language has accelerated
with the advent of mass communication and increased mobility of the population.
At the same time, however, Standard Frisian has gained some important support
in the past decade or two through greater use of the language in the schools and
by the regional and provincial governing bodies, to the extent that some nonFrisian-speaking residents of the province have declared themselves discriminated against when available civil service positions are advertised in Frisian
only!
Nonetheless, because a fair amount of dialectal diversity is still found in the
literary language, Standard Frisian does not have as strict a norm as do many
other standard languages. In this grammar I have attempted, where variation
exists, to include the most common form found in the literary and spoken
language. At the same time, I have sometimes added, often in parentheses or with
a note to the effect, variants which are widely accepted in the written and/or
spoken language. Still, this work adheres closely to the literary standard in that6Frisian Reference GrammarDutch loanwords or constructions are avoided unless they are so well establishedthat they cannot be ignored.","[9, 10, 11]"

past participle by a change in the vowel of the stem, rather than by the addition
of a suffix. At one time the vowel changes, or ablaut as it is sometimes called,
were quite well defined on the basis of seven categories. In today’s language,
however, the system has become so muddled - this holds true for some other
Germanic languages as well - that strong verbs must essentially be considered
irregular, although a few patterns may still be discerned.
The stem for the preterite and the past participle is thus not predictable by tule
for the strong verbs. Given the principal parts, though, the various tenses can be
built by adding the appropriate suffixes. The present and preterite conjugations
are illustrated below with nimme ‘take’ and ite ‘eat’. Notice that the personal
endings are identical to those of the class I verbs, so that strong verbs are
distinguished from class I verbs solely by the irregular formation of the principal
parts:Present Participle:

"A general limitation on breaking is that it never occurs before an immediately
following g or ch. Words like each ‘eye’ will never be broken in the plural:
eagen. Beyond this, the rule is very rare with stems ending in f or v. The only
common examples are /eaver ‘rather’ and leafst ‘most of all’, which in the
synchronic language are not semantically a true comparative and superlative, and
the diminutive form briefke [brj.fke] from brief ‘letter’. The plural brieven is
never broken.
Yet few other rules can be formulated. It is not accurate to say that certain
stems always undergo breaking and others do not. For example, does the stem ear
‘ear’ undergo the process? Well, the plural is never broken, but as first member
of a compound ear is subject to the alternation in earizer [jeri:zar] ‘woman’s
headdress’ but not in earbel [verbel] ‘ear ring’. Similarly, ien ‘one’ is broken in
iennich [jinex] ‘only’ but not in ienheid [ienhit] ‘unity’. Nonetheless, it is a
general tendency for a particular stem to be broken in most cases or never.
It is further impossible to state that any particular suffix motivates breaking
while others do not. Virtually any morphological suffix may be an environment
for the process. Some stems will undergo breaking with a specific suffix while
others will not. With -/ik, for example, the rule applies to ien ‘one’ and goed
“good’, producing ienlik [jilak] ‘single’ and guodlik [gwodlok] ‘goodly’ , but does
not apply to sierlik ‘decorative’ and leaflik ‘dear’.
One tendency which does hold, for the most part, is that if the plural of a nounis subject to breaking, the corresponding diminutive will be also. Thus, if we
know that the plural of hier ‘hair’ is hierren [(h)juren], we may assume that the20Frisian Reference Grammardiminutive is [(h)jurko]. CommonexamplesPronunciationof where this otherwise generalNOTE:Breaking is obviouslya complexphenomenonwhichhas essentially only beensummarized in this discussion. More details on the historical development are available in
Miedema (1958), Markey (1975), Van der Meer (1977, 1986), Booij (1989) and Visser
(1990). The synchronic situation is described in Tiersma (1979, chapter 1) and Tiersma
(1983), while phonetic details are to be found in De Graaf and Tiersma (1980).
The extent to which breaking is applied varies somewhat from dialect to dialect. In the
Stidwesthoeke, breaking does not take place at all - where broken diphthongs occur in
mainland dialects (and in Standard Frisian), these dialects tend to have shortened vowels
instead. Even among the mainland dialects there are differences in how consistently breaking
is applied, and often there is variation from speaker to speaker as well. Where one person may
pronounce koalen ‘coals’ as [kwalon], another may say [koolon]. In general it is true that use
of breaking is gradually receding throughout the language. Older grammars attest broken
forms (like deafet (djefet] ‘coffin’) which strike one as antiquated or bizarre today, and older
speakers use more breaking than does the younger generation. See in this regard Boelens
(1980, 1987) and Boelens and Ytsma (1989).‘hear’

as it geriis ‘the noise’ or it finthald ‘the memory’. Nouns formed from adjectives

"IntroductionFrisian Reference Grammar21.2. OriginsThe first historical mention of the Frisians was made just after the time of Christ
by Pliny, who locates them near the mouth of the Rhine. Tacitus later
corroborates this. Nonetheless, the exact extent of Frisian territory in early times
cannot be determined with absolute accuracy. What seems fairly certain is that
Frisian was spoken along the North Sea coast between what is now the Iselmar
(Du. IJsselmeer) in The Netherlands and the Weser River in Germany. It was
also the language of the upper part of the province of North Holland and appears
at times to have been spoken even further south along the coast. North Friesland
was colonized from East or West Friesland in two migration waves in the 8th/9th
century and the 11th/12th century, which accounts for the fact that the regions
between East and North Friesland are not traditionally Frisian-speaking.
The earliest documentation of the Frisian language comes from East and West
Friesland, mainly in the form of runic inscriptions and isolated words or names
in Latin texts. The oldest complete texts in Frisian are legal documents which
date from the thirteenth century, although they almost certainly reflect a
language older than that. Until approximately 1550 several manuscripts containing mainly Frisian legal texts were compiled in both East and West Friesland. The language of this period is referred to as Old Frisian, even though Old
Frisian does not overlap chronologically with other “old” Germanic dialects like
Old English.
Although the hypothesis that Old Frisian and Old English are derived from a
common mother tongue known as Anglo-Frisian is an oversimplification, it
remains true that Frisian is genetically the closest related language to English.
The tremendous influence of French on English and of Dutch on Frisian, along
with natural changes over time, has obscured this, but even today certain
features common to Frisian and English (as opposed to Dutch and German)
document this relationship. One common development in English and Frisian is
that eg became an ei or ai sound in certain positions, as the following words
attest:Frisian

4.1.1.2. The definite article
The singular forms of the definite article are de [da] and it [at], both meaning
‘the’, and de for all plural nouns: de man ‘the man’; it has ‘the house’; de
mannen ‘the men’; de huzen ‘the houses’.
The choice between de and it is almost entirely a lexical matter. At one time
Frisian had a three-way gender system (masculine, feminine, neuter), much like
that in German or Latin. Because of certain phonological changes this distinction
has been reduced to two: words with it are a reflex of the former neuter gender,
and those with de can be traced back to the masculine and feminine. For that
reason, words using it are here referred to as neuter and those taking de as
common.
It must be emphasized that the terms neuter and common have no clearcut
relationship to natural gender. A woman may be referred to as it wiif ‘the wife,
woman’ and a girl or boy as it famke or it jonkje, even though all of these terms
are grammatically neuter. When speaking about it famke, however, the pronounhja or sy is utilized.",[28]
"44Frisian Reference GrammarDit, dizze, dat, and dy are all used substantively (as nouns) in the singular: datis healwizerij ‘that is craziness’ ; dizze is te fersliten ‘this one is too worn down’,etc. In the plural dizzen ‘these’ and dyen (or dy) may occur: dizzen binne beferzen
‘these are frozen’; jou my dy mar ‘give me those, please’; fan dyen kin men soks
ferwachtsje ‘you can expect that from those’
NOTE: Dit is and dat is are sometimes pronounced [dis] and [dos] in colloquial Frisian.

Sommige and inkel(d)e assume an -n suffix when used

‘a bunch of’. Another
such quantifier is folle ‘much’, but be aware that folle
never stands alone before
a noun - it must always be part of a larger expression,
as in te folle ‘too much’
or net folle ‘not much’. The word min also acts as a
quantifier, but only in the

means ‘bad’: te min iten

tredde ‘two thirds’; in fjirde (part) ‘a fourth’; etc.
Heal ‘half’, which is inflected
as an adjective, is often broken: healwei ‘halfway’
is [jelvai], [jelvi] or [jelve];
healbroer ‘half brother’ is [jelbruer]. The number
oardel (originally oardeheal)
means ‘one and a half’, and remains uninflected.
The same is true for the much
less common treddel ‘two and a half’ and the higher
compositions of this type.
Multiplicatives like once and twice are expressed
by the cardinal number plus
kear, which always remains singular: ien kear
‘once’; trije kear ‘three times’;
etc. Kear may also occur with ordinals: de tweintichste
kear ‘the twentieth time’.
Compounds like twaris ‘two times’ and trijeris
‘three times’ are more literary.
Numbers take an -en under specific conditions
when in certain types of
prepositional phrases. It is quite common in phrase
s of time: ik kom foar trijen
‘T'll come before three o’ clock’; ’t is tweintich Soar
fiven ‘it’s twenty before five
(o’clock)’; but: wy ite om seis oere ‘we eat at six
o’clock’ (note that in the last
example, vere is expressed). Numbers with -en
are also encountered in phrases
beginning with mei, as in mei tis fjouweren ‘with
a group of four, all four of us’.
Expressions with containers for measures are direct
ly followed by the relevant
substance, without a preposition: trije glézen bier
‘three glasses of beer’. When
the word forthe container is omitted, the name
pluralized: twa bier ‘two beers’, not *twa
bieren.‘just, merely’: : ik ha mar twa ‘T just have two’; hy woe mar ite ‘he jus

bs in Frisian: moai ‘pretty’
is unaltered - hja skildert moai ‘she paints nicely
’; or hy koe goed sjonge ‘he
could sing well’.
There are words which are strictly adverbs, withou
t an equivalent adjective.
Often these are in the form of diminutive plurals, or
they may have the suffix -ling
or -lik: stintsjes ‘softly’; efkes ‘just, briefly’; hoasf
uotling ‘on stockinged feet’;
earsling ‘ass-backwards’; ryklik “generously’.
A particularly interesting set of adverbs may be called
emotives. They are words
which express the emotions of the speaker regarding
the validity, the importance,
or the duration of a particular action. Some examp

wérmeli
wérnjonken‘for what (reason)’
‘out of what’
‘with what’
‘next to what’ouFrisian Reference GrammarMorphologyNote that the prepositions behalven, fanwegen, te, and sant
do not form
compounds in this manner: behalven dat ‘except for that’
instead of
*dérbehalven. Yet te and siint do not take dit or dat as an object.
Prepositions often have a wide variety of meanings which
are difficult to
categorize. Below is a list of the most important Frisian preposi
tions with some
illustrations of how they are used:and Jirnsum’.
tusken ‘between’: tusken Grou en Jirnsum “between Grouachter (or efter) ‘behind’: se siet achter my ‘she sat

the noun phrase. Some examples:

and daalder ‘one and one — half guilders’ from original *keller and *daler. Here
the d is now simply part of the word, rather than being inserted by rule.
Rather more subtle are cases of a stem plus suffix which, often due to
irregularities in meaning, are no longer generated from the base form by rule. Thus
even though they can be analyzed into separate morphemes, they act as words and
the d is therefore part of that lexical item, rather than being viewed as inserted.
An example of this is minder ‘worse, fewer’, which is strictly speaking the comparative of min ‘bad’ but deviates from it semantically. Similar is the word bjinder
‘brush’, which is technically an agentive of bjinne ‘scrub’, but is no longer a true
agentive in meaning. It is therefore a word unto itself, and the d is part of that
word. Bjinner is the real agentive of bjinne in the meaning of ‘a person who
scrubs’.
With other stems ending in n or / the insertion of d is essentially optional,
although some comparatives and agentives are preferred with it ( postrinder
‘postman’) and others without. For the most part, older and more conservative
speakers tend to insert d frequently in this environment, while younger people do
so seldom or never.
NOTE: See Tiersma (1980), chapter 2, for further information on d-insertion.","[23, 24]"
"4.2.4.5. Verbs with the auxiliary wéze in place
of hawwe
There are certain verbs that involve motion
and change of state. These verbs
typically form complex tenses with wéze ‘be’
instead of hawwe ‘have’. This is
true in Dutch and German also, as it was in
older English (J am come for present
IT have come, and he is risen for modern he has
risen). One difference with these
other languages is that in Frisian, wéze itself
usually takes hawwe as a helping
verb: ik hie west ‘I had been’.
Verbs which use wéze include barre ‘happen’,
begjinne ‘begin’, bliuwe ‘stay’,
falle ‘fall’, farre ‘sail’, fleane ‘fly’, gean
‘go’, groeie “grow’, komme ‘come’,
ophalde ‘stop’, reizgje ‘travel’, ride ‘ride’,
rinne ‘walk’, sakje ‘sink, be
lowered’, sile ‘sail’, sinke ‘sink’, slagje
‘succeed’, springe ‘jump’, stjerre
‘die’, tsjen ‘trek’, Antstean ‘originate’, and
wurde ‘become’.
Some further examples:ik bin flein
ik wie kommen
ik sil fearn wéze‘I have flown’
‘T had come’
‘T will have sailed’These verbs must be intransitive; if used
transitively, they take the auxiliary
hawwe:
ik ha de fleanmasine flein‘I flew the airplane’4.2.5. Irregular verbs

"5.4.2. Conditional statementsA conditional (if... then) statement is generally preceded by at or as. As ca
to counterfactual statements, the verb tense is in the future or present, rather tha
in the preterite:
atsto (asto) moarn komst, (dan)sille wy wille hawwe‘if you come tomorrow, (then) we will have funat (as) de kat gers yt, (dan) begjint it aansten te reinen
‘if the cat eats grass, it will soon begin to rain
it hea droeget min, at (as) de sinne net skynt
‘the hay dries poorly if the sun doesn’t shine
The conjunction at or as may be left out of some of these clauses, in which case
the sentences open with the condition and the verb is in first position:
komsto moarn, dan sille wy wille hawwe
yt de kat gers, dan begjint it aansten te reinen
skynt de sinne net, dan droeget it hea min
Another type of conditional statement consists of the condition,
conjunction, as the second part of a sentence:
der moat in dokter by komme, sil er better wurde
‘a doctor must come to him, if he is to become mg
moatte betiid fan béd, wolle we moarnier te silenwithnobit""he must get out of bed early, if we are to go sailing tomorrow morning

"In native (or nearly native) words of more than one syllable, the stress isgenerally on the first vowel:
‘biizehappert’boargermantel*susterNon-native words, especially those of French origin, are stressed on the final
syllable:
pa’pierlo’kaalka’dokabi’netka’jutfat’soenstu’dintWhen the last syllable is inherently unstressable, that is, a schwa or syllabic
consonant, the stress in words of French origin is penultimate:
mi’rakelga’raazjemirt’adeCompounds (words made up of two or more independent lexical items) often have
main stress on the first element, especially when the first is a noun:
’easthiis’biisdoek’figebeam‘heitelan’manlju’molkkarre’finsterbankWhen the first element is an adjective, the stress is on the stem of the second
element:
wiid’weidichAlder’wetskjong’faamreade’koalwankel’moedichjonge’manswak’sinnichbarm’hertich34Frisian Reference GrammarPronunciationbiithiis’doaraldjiers’jiinskoarstien’mantelCertain compound geographical names and compounds relating to time also have
a tendency to receive stress on the second element:
see’dykPrinse’tiinJuster’jiinmoarn’ierMin’einOffen’wierSuffixes can have varying effects on stress. Indigenous ones like -lik, -ich,
-achtich, -ens, -dom, -heid, -skip, -ster and others, as well as all inflectional
suffixes, do not carry primary stress:""guodlik
’boadskip
’skriuwster ’doarke
’grienachtich
_—’smoargens
frijdom*doarren
’*wierheid*hillichThe affixes -inne and -es, both signifying female agents, take primary stress, as
do suffixes of French origin and -erij:freon’dinne
sli’taazjeboer’inne_prin’ses
buorke’rij bakke’rijdemon’straasjedemon’strearjeThe state of affairs with prefixes is more intricate. First of all, there are prefixes
which are never stressed, like be-, ge-, fint-, fer-, and te-:
te’gearre
te’minstenbe’dekke
tint’hdldebe’ gjinnefer’ heegjege’woange’ rlisOther prefixes, mainly oar- and ant-, always receive primary stress:
’oardiel’antwurd’antlit*oarkonde’bystan by’ienkomste
’tagong
’yngong’omtinkenRelated to the above is the alternation present in certain noun-adjective pairs:ienfald
*tagong
""earmoed
*freonskipien’faldichta’gonklik
ear’moedich
freon’ skiplikA class of adverbs which goes counter to those above is those formed with inoar
or elkoar, which are roughly synonymous:
*metinoar’ynelkoar‘titelkoar’trochinoar’trochelkoarStress in verbs, like that of many Germanic languages, is often dependent upon
whether the prefix of the verb is separable or not. Separable prefixes are those,
like the foar in ’foargean ‘to go ahead’, which can stand alone, as in wy geane
foar ‘we go ahead’. These are always accented on the prefix. The inseparable
prefixes are never stressed, on the other hand, except obviously when they are
prefixes which are inherently stressed. Note the stress differences in the following
sets of verbs:Separable:’bystean
’delsette
foljitte
’oanhelje
‘opfrette
’foargean
*indergean
’tawinskje
Inseparable: fol’dwaanoer’winneiinder’fine’oersmite*omkearefoar’sizzeThe inherently unstressed prefixes be-, ge-, fer-, te-, and ant- might simply be
viewed as inseparable prefixes, which accounts for why they are never accented.
But notice that the opposite is not true - the inherently stressed syllables ant- and
oar- are never separable, and hence their inherent stressability cannot be related
to separability.
Non-primary stresses have been largely ignored in this discussion, not because
they do not exist, but rather because their presence is largely predictable given theprimary stress. As is true also in English, the basic rhythm of Frisian is anBeyond these general guidelines the syntactic category of a word is of great
importance. With words containing prefixes which are not inherently stressed or
unstressed, it is usually true that nouns will be accented on the prefix itself, while
adjectives, adverbs, and prepositions will receive stress on the stem:
Nouns: ’oandacht
‘finnocht
'misdieta’gonklikAdverbs/prepositions: by’lans foar’op foar’by fan’sels fan’nacht om’heech
oer’ein fan’wegenETboere’feintAdjectives: iin ’mooglik fol’slein fol’woeksenitNormally, when an adjective and a noun come together, each is stressed equally:
jonge ‘man. In contrast, the stress of jonge’man indicates that it must be
considered a compound, rather than simply an adjective and noun.
There is a further set of compounds in which the first part is a noun, but which,
unlike compounds like ’ gasthiis, have stress on the second element. The explanation may lie in part in the fact that often the first element, though a noun,
somehow modifies the second. Whatever the reason, these compounds are stressed
as though the first element were an adjective:‘foarpoat’tindergongalternation of accented and unaccented syllables. Thus the general tendency is forthe syllables directly adjacent to the one with main stress to be unaccented, andthe ones adjacent to that to have secondary or tertiary stress:
bithisdédrfinsterbankbiizehappertlédekdntwiidwéidichIn each of the above words the basic stressed-unstressed rhythm is maintained asthe syllables directly adjoining the main stress are unaccented and those that aretwo syllables away receive secondary stress.","[24, 25]"

"5.1.11. ModalsModal verbs are those which express a mood or an attitude towards a particular
action. A modal is therefore usually associated with another verb, although
sometimes in actual discourse the verb may be understood. Most modals are inorigin preterite-present verbs, a class of words in Germanic which, for historical
reasons not relevant today, is characterized in the present tense by the fact that104105Frisian Reference GrammarSyntaxthe third person singular has no overt suffix: hy kin ‘he can’, not *hy kint. TheWhen a modal occurs with gean as the main verb in a sentence in whichfollowing are the Frisian modal verbs. The conjugation of the modals, which is
somewhat irregular, is listed with the other irregular verbs in sec. 4.2.5.doare‘dare (to)’: doarsto oer de sleat springe? ‘do you dare jump over
the ditch?’ As in English, the gerund with te may also be used:
doarsto oer de sleat te springen? ‘do you dare to jump over the
ditch?’
hoege
‘needto’. This occurs only witha negative in the sentence, and takes
a verb with te: jo hoege dat net te dwaan ‘you don’t have to do
that’; Jan hoecht neat te keapjen ‘Jan doesn’t have to buy
anything’. Note that doare and hoege both take te plus the gerund,
and that they also distinguish themselves in taking the -t suffix in
the third person singular, although more conservative varieties of
the language generally have hy doar. The g or ch is not always
pronounced in conversational speech: hoecht is pronounced [hut],
and hoech and hoege may both be [hu] before consonants other than
[h]. In dependent clauses hoege may also occur without te: ik
hoopje dat ik dat net dwaan hoech ‘T hope that I don’t have to do
that’.
kinne
‘can, be able to, be possible’: dat kin net ‘that is not possible’; iis
beppe kin goed skake ‘our grandmother can play chess well’.
meie _— “may, like to’: se mei net swimme ‘she may not swim’; omke mocht
altyd graach in piip smoke ‘uncle always liked to smoke a pipe’.
Meie with lije ‘suffer’ means to like someone or something; often
the lije is not expressed: ik mei syn koart hier net lije ‘I can’t stand
his short hair’; Aukje mocht gjin siipe ‘Aukje didn’t like buttermilk’.
moatte ‘must’: do moatst in nije biezem meitsje ‘you have to make a new
broom’; jo moatte net te gau in eigen kompjiiter keapje ‘you should
not buy your own computer too soon’.
sille
‘will, shall’: ik sil weromkomme ‘I will return’; ik soe weromkomme
‘I was going to return’; soe Sytse dat wol kinne? ‘would Sytse be
able to do that?’ Sentences with sille and the particle wol express
probability: dat sil (’t ) wol ‘that’s probably so’; jimme sille wol
this bliuwe moatte ‘you will probably have to stay at home’.
wolle
‘want to’: ik woe tige graach reedriden leare ‘I wanted very much
to learn how to skate’
NOTE: Modal verbs, with the exception of doare and hoege, have a deontic and an epistemic
meaning. In the former case the modal says something about the capability, wish, etc., of thesubject, in the latter it says something about the possibility, desirability, etc., of the whole
proposition. Compare Hylke koe fytse ‘Hylke could ride a bicycle’, which is about Hylke’scapability to ride a bike, and Hylke koe wol siik wéze ‘Hylke might be ill’, which refers to the
possibility of Hylke’s being ill. On this distinction, see Hoekstra (1990).movement from one place to another is fairly predictable, the verb gean is usually
left out:Hette soe moarn fuort “Hette was going to go away tomorrow’
ik wol ek nei Loaiengea ‘I want to go to Loaiengea also
NOTE: This phenomenon of infinitive ellipsis is discussed in detail in Hoekstra (1997, Ch.","[59, 60]"

"5.1.10. NegationSentences are normally made negative by words like net ‘not’, noait (or more
literary nea) ‘never’, gjinien ‘nobody’, neat ‘nothing’, noch ‘nor’, gjin ‘no’
nimmen nobody’, and so forth. Noait (nea) functions essentially as an adverb
of time, nimmen and gjinien as pronouns, and noch as a conjunction.
Gjin is a determiner, hence uninflected, and is the negative form of in ‘a’. In
other words, instead of saying hy hat net in fyts ‘he does not have a bicycle’, one
normally says hy hat gjin fyts ‘he has no bicycle’. As can in, gjin can be followed
by adjectives: gjin tike boer ‘not a competent farmer’; gjin skerp mes ‘no sharp
knife’. Indefinite plural and mass nouns also take gjin: gjin skerpe messen ‘no
sharp knives ; gjin siipe ‘no buttermilk’. Gjin can also be used substantively, as
in ik ha gjin ‘I have none’ or ik ha gjinnen.",[59]
"The symbols used to represent the diphthongs are in some ways a bit arbitrary.
For example, the first element of [gy] does not occur in the standard language as
an independent vowel, and so the [9g] is used only as an approximation of this
sound. In addition, a diphthong like [ai] is not just the vowel [a] followed by an
[i], as[have rather simplistically described it above, but instead represents move-ment from a sound near [a] to a sound near [i], including all the articulatory
positions between the beginning and end points. What distinguishes a “pure”
vowel from a diphthong, then, is that the former is one protracted articulatory
gesture, while a diphthong involves movement from one point of articulation to
another.
Frisian is often analyzed as having triphthongs, such as [iou] in leauwe and
bleau, [uai] in moaier, or [uoi] in muoike and muoite. It is also possible,
however, to regard these as the glides [j] or [w], followed by a vowel ordiphthong, as I do here.tins

‘lie in’[u:s]
[ifolo]
[iveje][ija:n]
[irune]{ilze]When a short vowel plus 7 is followed by an s, the vowel is not simply nasalized,
but also lengthened. So winst ‘profit’ (from winne) is pronounced [vé:st]. Note
also examples such as those below:
prins
geunst
ferskynsel

‘favor’
‘phenomenon’

[feskT:sel]
[mé:st]TT[ai]phonetically by the presence of a tilde [~] over the vowel. Thus the word yn [in]
‘in’ when followed by sjen [sjen] ‘see’ becomes [Tsjen] ‘look in’. To phrase it a
bit differently, a vowel plus n becomes a nasalized vowel before any continuant
consonant besides h. Some examples:FTEin Eng. high or Dutch saai. In many areas it is
presently pronounced as [o:i].s, 2, f, v, j, r, l, or w becomes a nasalized vowel. A nasalized vowel is indicatedTTTttt[sy]2.1.2.1. Nasalization

[mwa:s]A number of speakers, often older, lengthen nasalized vowels before the st suffix
of the second person singular verb form:
winst*(you) win’=[vé:st]gunst
wynst‘(you) favor’
‘(you) wind’>
od[gd:st]
[vi:st]However, most Frisians today keep the short vowel throughout the verb
paradigm, as in [vist] and [g@st]. Usually, the long vowel remains in other forms,
as in the nouns above like geunst ‘(a) favor’.
The lengthening of nasalized vowels before s occurs only when the vowel is
stressed. While prins is pronounced [pré:s], the corresponding unaccented vowel
in prinses ‘princess’ [pri’ ses] remains short. Compare also provinsje [pro’vé:sja]
‘province’ with provinsjaal [provi’ sja:]] ‘provincial’.",[14]
"5.3.3.3. The complementizer ‘om...te’
Whole sentences may function as subjects or verbal complements of other
sentences. Such an embedded sentence is preceded by om, and the verb which
would stand in second position (V1) of the embedded clause if it were independent, actually occurs at the end of V2 and is preceded by te:hja frege om meigean te kinnen ‘she asked to be able to go along’
om hjir te swimmen is net ferstannich ‘to swim here is not advisable
5.3.3.3.1. The type ‘om fuort te gean is noflik’
A clause with the complementizer om...te may function as the subject of a
sentence, as the following examples show:om in boeresoan in horloazje te jaan is in Gld gebritk
‘it is an old custom to give a farmer’s son a watch’
om Jelle mei te nimmen liket my wol aardich ta
‘to take Jelle along seems pleasant to me’
om op ’e moanne rinne te wollen is net in finbegryplike winsk
‘to want to walk on the moon is not an incomprehensible wish’
Notice that with the above examples the nominalized sentence does not have a
specified subject — it is assumed that the subject is anyone or someone. Nor can
the subject be expressed in this type of construction; sentences like the EnglishSyntax
