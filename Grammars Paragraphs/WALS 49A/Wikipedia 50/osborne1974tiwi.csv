2.3 Embedding
A sentence may be embedded in a noun phrase or relator-axis phrase. A sentence
embedded in a noun phrase is inserted immediately following a noun which is its
underlying object. There is no relative pronoun or other overt sign of the embedding
process.

cribed in 3.1, 3.2, and 3.3 respectively. The noun phrases function like a noun, i.e.
as subject or object, or in any other syntactic slot filled by nouns, the verb phrases
function like a verb, i.e. as VP in a verbal sentence, and the relator-axis phrases
fill the locative slot in sentence structure.
3.1 Noun phrases
The processes for forming noun phrases are coordination, attribution, apposition,
possessor orientation, and goal orientation. These are described in 3.1.1, 3.1.2,
3.1.3, 3.1.4, and 3.1.5 respectively.
3.1.1 Coordination
The coordination of mutually independent nominals within a phrase is usually
achieved through juxtaposition and intonation alone, as there is no form equivalent
to English ‘and’. The process is recursive and there is thus, in principle at least,
no limit to the number of nominals which can be coordinated.
rjunirja jiliya
possum (and) carpet snake
kajiwa jurupuni
needle (and) vine
It is usual for the coordinated nominals to have the same syntactic function in
sentence structure, e.g. mampuya jiikajimi kajiwa jurupuni ‘He used to make canoes
with needle and vine’, in which both kajiwa ‘needle’ and jurupuni ‘vine’ function as
instrument, but this is by no means always the case. It is quite common for nominals
which function as subject and object respectively to be coordinated, e.g. jipuyipa
yar uwani kayi pijaja, purukupajli japara ‘He hit his brother in the eye, Purukupajli
and Xapara’. (Purukupajli is subject and Tapara object.)
Human nominals are sometimes coordinated by means of the personal pronoun
wuta ‘they’, inserted either at the beginning of the sequence, or between each member
of the sequence, or both.
purukupajli wuta tapara
Purukupajli and Japara
wuta japara waijai
Japara and Waijai73
wuta ta^ksfiaijki wuta jardma'jii wiita tuitjini
Xagkanaqki, Jarsma'ju and Jijigini
Some speakers insert a form awi between coordinated nominals to indicate the
non-finality of the first, e.g. purukupaul awi mauimpunini ‘Purukupajli and
Majimpunini’, but this is entirely optional and appears to be restricted to a few'
speakers.
3.1.2 Attribution
The deep structural relation of ‘quality’ concepts to ‘thing’ concepts finds expression
in syntax through either of two processes — predication and attribution. That is,
a quality may be either predicated of a thing (e.g. murukupwaua pumpuka ‘The girl
(is) nice’), or attributed to it {pumpuka murukupwaja ‘a nice girl’). The two con¬
structions are transformationally related, going back to a common thing-quality
relationship in deep structure, and are distinguished in surface structure solely by
the different orders of the constituents.
In surface structure a noun and its attribute are brought together in a headmodifier construction, which is signalled by means of class (noun and adjective),
juxtaposition (nothing can be interposed between the constituents), order (modifier
preceding head), concord (modifiers agree in number and gender with the head),
and intonation (a single phrase contour extends over the construction).
auikulani prakapai
big
crocodilea big crocodilepiija mampuija
a bad canoe
bad
canoe
The modifiers in this construction are of three kinds — demonstratives, quantifiers
(i.e. numerals and quantity adjectives) and qualifiers, each class filling a slot to the
left of the head, in the order demonstrative + quantifier -t- qualifier + head. Each
of the slots is optional and each may occur independently of the others.
pumpuwi palapamwawi
good dogs
juraua palaijamwawi
two dogs
kapinatjki palaijamwawi
these dogs
juraua pumpuwi palaijamwawi
two good dogs
kapinaijki pumpuwi palaijamwawi
these good dogs
kapinayki juraua palaijamwawi
these two dogs
kapinaijki juraua pumpuwi palaijamwawi
these two good dogs
Attribution is not a highly developed process in Tiwi —nor probably in any
Australian language. There is no potential for generating elaborate strings of
adjectives, and even the limited potential which does exist is used very sparingly.
The tendency is to use adjectives predicatively rather than attributively. For example,
ijauapiuni mauini. tuniwini ‘I killed a possum. (It was) a black one’, might very well
be preferred to ijauapiuni tuniwini mauini ‘I killed a black possum’.
3.1.3 Apposition
Apposition is the process for relating within a phrase two nominal expressions
having the same referent, one serving to identify the referent and the other to define
or characterise it. The identifying nominal is placed first and the defining nominal
follows it.
waijai jimpaulina
Waijai the woman
purukupauli ijunantani
Purukupajli the bereaved man
The apposition may be between a personal name and a kinship term, a personal
name and a common noun, a kinship term and a common noun, and even between
two kinship terms, but not between two personal names or between two common
nouns. The general principle is that one nominal should uniquely identify the
referent while the other places it in the context of its relationships.","[87, 88, 89]"

0WORD CLASSESThe word classes are defined by reference to the kind of meaning they express,
syntactic function and morphological structure. The main division is between full
words (those which express ‘lexical’ concepts such as ‘man’, ‘tree’, ‘water’) and
function words (those which are used to establish syntactic relations and express
grammatical concepts such as ‘past’, ‘plural’, ‘first person’, and which do not ‘occur
by themselves’ in the same sense that full words do). Full words are items of semantic
substance, as it were, while function words are among the signals which are used
in organising these items of substance into sentences expressing the relations between
them. Full word classes are usually large and open while function word classes are
small and closed.
The two major word classes are nominals and verbs, and the other full word classes
are verbal nouns, predicatives, adverbs and interjections. The function words are
pronouns, negative adverbs, tense markers, introducers, conjunctions and prepositions.
Nominals are the names of ‘things’ in a very general sense (i.e., persons, animals
or inanimate objects), have a characteristic morphology expressing gender and
number, and can function as subject or object of a sentence, as well as in other
roles such as instrument. They are subdivided into nouns (e.g. tdraka, ‘wallaby’,
iaputa, ‘camp’, ajawunirjkui, ‘spear’) and adjectives (e.g. pumpuni, ‘good’, j^uti,
‘bad’, ajikulani, ‘big’). Adjectives refer either to a ‘quality’ (again in a quite general
sense) or to a thing having that quality. They share all the syntactic functions and
the morphology of nouns {pumpuni, for example, may mean ‘the good one’ as well
as ‘good’, auikulani may mean ‘the big one’ as well as ‘big’), but differ from nouns
syntactically in their ability to function as modifier of a noun or verb.
Nouns are subdivided into proper nouns (e.g. iipuwalaniwiti'wi (personal name),
marakawijaija (place name)) and common nouns (e.g. tiijati ‘sand’, wiija ‘sea’), and
adjectives are subdivided into common adjectives (e.g. jurukuni ‘long’, kauuwuni
‘short’) and numerals (e.g. jiraja ‘two’, pu^iniijita, ‘five’).
Verbs are words which name ‘activities’, have a characteristic morphology ex¬
pressing tense, aspect and mood, among other things, and function syntactically
as the predicate of a sentence. They are subdivided into full verbs (e.g. iuwuffjlsraumani
‘she was cooking’, jinipakupauli ‘he came back’) and auxiliary verbs (e.g. yduimi
‘I did’, jjduima ‘I did’). The function of auxiliary verbs is to fill the Auxiliary slot
in Periphrastic verb phrase (e.g. joi tjdjimi ‘I danced’, literally ‘dance I-did’). There
are only four auxiliary verb stems-mi, -ma, -pi and -kauimi—but the last of
these also functions as a full verb.
Verbal nouns are words which have verb-like meaning but lack the morphological
structure and syntactic function of verbs (e.g. joi ‘dance’, kutupi ‘jump’, ani ‘give’).","[72, 73, 74]"
"The cover symbols used in the syntax (e.g. ‘S’ for Subject, ‘O’ for Object) are
explained in the sections in which they are introduced. Phonetic symbols used are
those recommended by the International Phonetic Association, revised to 1951.

1THE LANGUAGE1.1 Location
Tiwi is the language of the Aboriginal people of Melville and Bathurst Islands near
Darwin on the north coast of Australia. i The two islands constitute a single
geographical unit and tribal area of approximately 3000 square miles, being
separated by only a narrow channel, in places not much more than half a mile across.
They are separated from the Australian mainland by the Clarence Strait to the
south and the Dundas Strait to the east, and their distance from the continental
coastline varies from about fifty to about fifteen miles at the narrowest points. The
fifteen-mile gap to the south, however, between Cape Gambler (the southern
extremity of Melville Island) and Gunn Point on the mainland opposite, is partly
bridged by a chain of small islands extending north from the mainland, and the
channel between Cape Gambler and the northernmost of these islands is only eight
miles wide. In former times the Tiwi were distributed fairly evenly over the length
and breadth of both islands — i.e., over a total area approximately one hundred
miles from east to west and thirty miles from north to south — but today, as a
result of contact with European culture, they are concentrated in four small settle¬
ments — a Catholic mission in the south-east corner of Bathurst Island, two welfare
settlements in the north-west of Melville Island and a forestry settlement also in
the western part of Melville Island. Apart from these settlements, the islands are
uninhabited and untouched by the hand of man.
1.2 Physical isolation
The close proximity of Melville and Bathurst Islands to the Australian mainland
would naturally lead one to suppose that there must have been a long history of
close contact between the Tiwi and the mainland tribes nearest to them. This sup¬
position would certainly be erroneous, however, as all the available evidence indicates
that there was scarcely any contact between the Tiwi and the mainland tribes, and
that the Tiwi were, in fact, virtually isolated from the outside world before the first
successful settlement of Europeans on the islands early in the twentieth century.2
The evidence which bears on the isolation of the Tiwi is of three main kinds
cultural, linguistic and historical — and may be briefly summarised as follows.
Firstly, Tiwi material culture differs from that of the mainland in a number of
striking, although not fundamental, respects. The boomerang and the woomera —
two of the most characteristic artefacts of the mainland — are missing on the islands,
on the other hand, the most important objects of Tiwi ritual and ceremonial, their
grave posts, are not found anywhere on the mainland. Tiwi art, too, is very unlike
that of the mainland, being more highly conventionalised and indeed almost nonrepresentational. The differences between Tiwi and mainland culture cannot be2
fully described here, but it can be stated that they are such as would not be expected
if close contact had existed between the Tiwi and mainland Aborigines.3
Secondly, the Tiwi language, while it is clearly of Australian Aboriginal stock,
differs very considerably from the languages of the nearby mainland. On the lexical
level especially, the dissimilarity is almost total as there are virtually no lexical
cognates. This degree of lexical dissimilarity suggests a very long period of isolation
from mainland languages.
Thirdly, Europeans who lived in the area in the nineteenth century (either on
Melville Island itself or on the nearby mainland) all gave the same picture of lack
of contact between the Tiwi and the mainland tribes. Major John Campbell, who
was commandant of the British garrison on Melville Island from 1825-1829 never
saw any non-Tiwi visitors during his time there, and was of the opinion that the
Tiwi never went to the mainland (Campbell 1834:158). The ethnologist Earl, who
spent some time at Port Essington to the east of Melville Island in the 1840s, makes
it clear that there was complete lack of contact between the Tiwi and the tribes of
Cobourg Peninsula (Earl 1853). Foelsche, a police inspector in Darwin in the latter
part of the nineteenth century, mentions the occasional raids the Tiwi made on
the mainland for the purpose of stealing women, but had apparently never seen
any Tiwi himself and had no other knowledge of them (Foelsche 1881). There is,
in fact, every indication that Europeans living on the mainland opposite Melville
and Bathurst Islands knew virtually nothing of the Tiwi and had never even seen
them before the islands began to be opened up to the outside world at the beginning
of the twentieth century.
The reasons why the Tiwi did not cross to the mainland regularly are not hard
to find. First, there was the lack of motivation for making the crossing. The Tiwi
were not short of food or of any of the necessities of Aboriginal life. There was
nothing they lacked which could be supplied by going to the mainland, and hence
no reason for crossing. Secondly, there was the lack of suitable boats for making
the crossing. Like all other Aborigines, the Tiwi had only frail canoes made out
of a single strip of bark, and while long journeys in these were by no means im¬
possible, any sea voyage in such a craft would have been a hazardous enterprise
and would not have been undertaken very often without suflBcient motivation.
Thirdly, the currents in the narrow part of Clarence Strait south of Cape Gambier
are rapid and dangerous, even for modern boats, and much more so for bark canoes.
1.3 Typological characterisation
Tiwi is a polysynthetic mainly agglutinative language,^ predominantly prefixing,
noun incorporating, and of the type in which synthesis is in the verb. In other
words it is a language in which all the elements of a sentence may be combined in
a single highly complex morphological structure. The Tiwi verb is, in effect, a
sentence in miniature, containing within itself not only pronominal reference to
subject and object but also markers of tense, aspect, mood and voice, besides various
other kinds of information, such as proximity and time of day. For example, the
sentence ‘He came and stole my wild honey this morning while I was asleep’ may
be translated by the single word jinuatdmamtjilipaijdmajlaiumafjsbpia^kina, and
‘He grabbed me by the foot as I was dancing in the evening’ by the single word
jimanikdmarikuaydpBmalitja. This potential for developing morphological structures
of such a very high degree of complexity, while fairly common in North America,
is quite exceptional in Australia. Nothing quite like it has been found anywhere
else in the continent, or on the Australian islands.5
Most striking and unusual of all (for an Australian language) is the capacity which
Tiwi has for incorporating noun-like forms into the structure of the verb, principally
as direct object. For instance, in the first of the two examples given above, the noun
object ‘wild honey’ is represented by the incorporated form majlajluma^abpi-, and,
in the second, the noun object ‘foot’ is represented by mali-. In this feature of its
syntax Tiwi is almost unique in Australia, as, although noun incorporation has
been reported in a few other Australian languages,^ its development in these3
languages is only in a very embryonic stage. Strangely enough, almost exactly
similar noun incorporation is found in certain American Indian languages.”^
1.4 Genetic relations
Although it is clear from the deep structure, semantics, general morphological
type and phonology that Tiwi is an Australian Aboriginal language, there is very
little that can be said at present about its genetic relations with other Australian
languages. Work done by Capell (Capell 1940, 1942) has shown that prefixing
languages are mainly confined to an area in the north of the continent, and that
noun-classifying languages (like Tiwi) are also mainly in the north; Tiwi is con¬
sequently shown to have more in common with the languages of its area than with
the languages of other areas. There are a great many languages in this northern
area, however, and the work of establishing Tiwi’s genetic relationships with these
other languages has not yet made any progress.
Lexical comparisons are quite useless for the purpose of establishing Tiwi’s
genetic relationships, as all that such comparisons ever reveal is that Tiwi has
virtually no lexical cognates with any other Australian language — even with
Jiwadja and Larakia, the two languages which are its closest neighbours geographic¬
ally, each being separated from it by only about fifteen miles of water. It is to be
assumed that Tiwi has been isolated from the mainland for several centuries, and
that, owing to the very rapid rate of lexical replacement under Aboriginal conditions,8 the vocabulary has been almost entirely replaced during this period.
Occasional cognates may be found in languages here and there, but the number
would never work out at even one per cent if expressed as a percentage of an
adequate sample. It is thus fairly certain that Tiwi’s genetic relationships will riever
be established through lexical comparison but only through structural comparison,
but this work of structural comparison has yet to be undertaken.
1.5 Dialects
Before their concentration into the present settlements by European influence in
the twentieth century, the Tiwi were divided into fourteen regional groups or
sub-tribes, each of which lived and hunted in its own area, and, except on the
occasions of big tribal gatherings, did not have much contact with other groups,
except for those immediately adjacent to it. The most distant groups were separated
by well over 100 miles and must have had very little direct contact with one another.
There is thus some reason to expect to find appreciable dialectal differences in the
language.
Whether there are in fact dialectal differences in Tiwi has not yet been established
as no formal study of this question has been attempted. It can be said, however,
that, if there are dialectal differences, they cannot be of a major order, as the
material collected for the present work was obtained from informants belonging
to various regional groups both on Melville Island and on Bathurst Island, and
does not reveal any obvious dialectal differences. Now it is probable that dialectal
study cannot be very fruitfully attempted, as the various regional groups have been
living together at settlements for some decades.
Hart’s view that there is a special variety of the language for use in song and
ritual (Hart 1930a: 178) was substantiated, but time did not permit much study of
this variety of the language. It differs from normal spoken Tiwi very considerably
in lexis, as many old words and incorporated forms which have died out in speech
have been retained in song. However, it is unlikely that it differs from ordinary
spoken Tiwi in syntax and morphology. The view expressed by some researchep
that the women speak a different variety of the language from the men is entirely
without substance. There is also no parallel in Tiwi to the ‘mother-in-law’ language
(used for addressing certain relatives) found by Dixon in Dyirbal (1968:19).
1.6 The present state of the language
Tiwi is today one of the very few Australian languages which are still in full use
as the normal medium of communication for an entire tribe. The majority of4
Aboriginal tribes have already either disintegrated or disappeared completely, and
their cultures and languages have either already vanished or are on the point of
vanishing, but, protected by their isolated situation from the full impact of contact
with European culture, the Tiwi have been fortunate enough not only to survive
as a tribe but to increase their numbers, and to retain something of their culture,
including above all their language. Tiwi is thus in the remarkable situation of being
spoken as first language by as many as 1400 people (a large number by Australian
standards) at a time when the majority of Australian languages have been reduced
to no more than a handful of speakers.
In spite of its success in surviving up to now, however, it cannot be expected
that Tiwi will survive as an effective medium of communication for very long into
the future. Education in English at the mission and settlement schools and constant
exposure to English in their everyday lives is rapidly diminishing the ability of the
Tiwi to speak their own language. People under forty speak and understand it much
less than those over sixty, and the present generation of children understand it less
still. It is to be expected that Tiwi will cease to function as a living language within
two or three generations, unless something is done to arrest the decline by en¬
couraging the use of Tiwi among young people, especially at schools.
2THE DESCRIPTIONThe description is quite informal and is neither based on any of the well-known
models nor in fact an attempt to justify or demonstrate a model of any kind. Concepts
and techniques are drawn from a variety of theories just as they seem necessary,
the primary purpose throughout being the empirical one of describing the facts of
the language, not to use the language as a means of demonstrating a theory.
The main influences on the work have been Boas-Sapir theory (for the basic
distinction between grammatical concepts and the formal devices which are used
to express them, and for the general mentalistic attitude to language which underlies
this distinction, see Boas 1911 and Sapir 1921); tagmemics (for the notion of
functional element used in the syntax, see Pike 1954 and Longacre 1964); trans¬
formational grammar (for the distinction between deep and surface structure, and
for the distinction between basic and non-basic structures and the use of trans¬
formation-type processes to derive the latter, see Chomsky 1957 and 1965); and
system-structure theory (for the distinction between transitivity and theme levels
used in explaining Tiwi word order, see Halliday 1967).
The basic attitude underlying the whole work is mentalism — the belief that
language exists in the mind and that writing a grammar is the attempt to discover
and describe conceptual schemes and general principles underlying actual observable
linguistic forms. The form and arrangement of the description — beginning with
the phonemes and working up to the syntax — is dictated by the needs of exposition,
not by the writer’s theory of grammar. If the arrangement were based directly on
this theory it would be in the reverse order, beginning with meanings and ending
with the noises, but a description of a language can no more be the direct reflection
of a theory of competence than of a theory of performance. It has to take account
of the ways in which readers assimilate information.
3EARLIER WORK ON THE LANGUAGEThe only other linguist to have worked on the language in any detail is Capell, whose
three papers (1940, 1942 and 1967) were the only work of any substance on the
language, previous to the present description. All three are concerned with the verb
morphology and together they provide a useful rough sketch of this part of the
grammar. The two earlier articles are surveys of very large numbers of north Aus¬
tralian lanjguages and are thus unavoidably very brief in their treatment of Tiwi,
but the third and more recent article provides a more substantial treatment.
The other work on the language is not of any importance and consists of a word
list with a few grammar notes by Spencer (1914), a short paper by Pilling (1960)5
dealing with some recent changes in the language and a study of a point of phonemic
analysis by Oates (1967).
The language is now being studied by members of the Summer Institute of
Linguistics whose aim is to produce a Tiwi translation of the Bible.
The present description does not derive in any way from previous work on the
language, but was done independently and based on entirely new data.
Explanatory Notes
1 The people of Melville and Bathurst Islands have no true tribal name. Living
in isolation from the rest of the world they never conceived of themselves as a
tribe any more than they thought of Melville and Bathurst Islands as islands.
Melville and Bathurst Islands were not islands to them but simply the world in
which they lived and they themselves were not a tribe but simply the people of
this world. They consequently called themselves simply tiwi — i.e., ‘human beings’
as opposed to animals — as this was the only contrast which was relevant in
their situation. When in relatively recent times the Melville and Bathurst Islanders
began to come in contact with the outside world, the outsiders could not be called
tiwi as they were simply not part of the conceptual structure within which the
word has meaning. The islanders have thus gone on restricting the use of the
term tiwi to themselves alone, and it has thus come to function, in effect, as a
tribal label. The use of the word as a tribal name was first suggested by Hart
(1930a: 169).
2 The Tiwi are known to have had sporadic contacts with Europeans from 1636
onwards and there must also have been a certain amount of contact with
Indonesians, as the latter are known to have visited the north coast of Australia
regularly from the eighteenth century on. The Tiwi are also known to have carried
out occasional wife stealing raids on the mainland. When viewed in proportion,
however, these various contacts are seen to have been rather insignificant from
the point of view of the history of the language. The picture must remain one
of a language developing in virtual isolation.
3 See Hart and Pilling (1960) for a brief account of some of the differences between
Tiwi culture and mainland Aboriginal culture.
Tiwi is agglutinative in the sense defined by Sapir (1921:129) in that the elements
(or at least some of the elements) of the verb structure are ‘juxtaposed’ rather
than ‘fused’ — that is, they remain psychologically distinct — and the meanings
expressed by these elements are ‘radical’ rather than ‘relational’.
5 See Capell (1942^:24).
6 Capell 1956:35 mentions Groote Eylandt and Nunggubuyu as two other north
Australian languages in which noun object may be incorporated.
7 See Sapir (1911). Tiwi noun incorporation resembles the noun incorporation
described by Sapir in North American Indian languages — especially that of
Nahuatl and Paiute — in all of the following respects: (a) incorporation is
restricted to only the commonest cultural items and to parts of the body; (b) any
class affixes found in the independent nominal are lost in the incorporated form.
Only the stem is incorporated and even this may be in a reduced form; (c) the
incorporated stem usually functions syntactically as direct object but it may
also have other functions — for example, instrument or locative. The morpho¬
logical structure is the same regardless of the syntactic function of the incor¬
porated stem; (d) in prefixing languages the incorporated nominal follows all the
inflexional affixes and immediately precedes the verb stem.
8 The very rapid rate of lexical replacement under Aboriginal conditions was a
result of the practice of placing a taboo not only on the names of dead people
but also on all words which sounded similar to those names. It is quite likely
that under these conditions the complete vocabulary of a language would be
replaced in the course of several centuries, and in the case of an isolated language
like Tiwi, the replacements would not be words borrowed from other languages
but new formations. See Hart (19306:281) for a discussion of this practice.","[15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21]"
"48
In the lists which are given below, incorporated forms are placed side by side with
the corresponding free forms or verb stems for the purpose of comparison, and
(t) is used to indicate cognate pairs. Incorporated forms and free forms are generally
not cognate, however, as the free forms which were cognate with the existing in¬
corporated forms have long since disappeared, owing to the rapid rate of lexical
replacement in Australian languages.
The number of incorporated forms is small compared with the number of free
forms and verb stems in the lexicon, and it is thus apparent that there are many
free forms and verb stems which have no exact equivalent in the list of incorporated
forms. The reason for this is that the meanings of the incorporated forms are
generally less specific than those of the free forms. For example, there are about
fourteen words referring to different types of wild honey, but there is only one
incorporated form referring to honey, and this has generic meaning — i.e., it does
not discriminate between the different types. In this way a relatively small number
of incorporated forms can cover the same semantic area as a much larger number
of free forms, but finer distinctions of meaning are lost as a result.
The incorporated forms undergo a number of morphophonological changes, or
induce changes in other morphemes, as follows: (1) Forms marked Ilb take initial
p, t, t or r, depending on the morphological environment (see Morphophonology,
2.3), e.g., ipanirji-, ‘egg’ -> pitjanipi-, tipaniiji-, tipanipi-, or rujanitji-. (2) Forms listed
with final fja- in parentheses have final tja- inserted preceding certain short stems
such as - mu, ‘sit’. (3) Forms with final a require the insertion of initial r in a
following lib stem, e.g., ji-, ‘he’ + paniija-, ‘raw meat’ + -amaunipa, ‘get up’
ji-i-paniija-ramajnipa, ‘He got up with the raw meat’.

2NOMINALSThe class of nominals includes both nouns and adjectives, the distinction between
these being that nouns are the names of persons, animals or things and adjectives
are the names of properties or qualities. Adjectives agree with nouns in number
and gender and the two classes are marked for these categories by the same formal
devices. Nominals are not inflected for case in Tiwi.
2.1 Noun classes
2.1.1 Concepts
The conceptual scheme which underlies the classification of Tiwi nouns is twodimensional, one dimension having the poles masculine and feminine and the other
human and non-human. There are thus four noun classes — masculine human,
masculine non-human, feminine human, and feminine non-human.
The two genders have a natural basis in that all male human beings and male
animals are classified as masculine and all female human beings and female animals
are classified as feminine. Animals whose sex cannot be determined by observation —
e.g., birds, fish, reptiles and insects — have their gender established in traditional
mythology. For example, waijai, the bush curlew, is known as the wife of
purukupauli; kujipurani, the frilly lizard, and ijan^a, the black cockatoo, are known
as brother and sister; jla^kanarjki, the white-breasted sea eagle, is the husband of
ijajiija, and so on.
Sex (actual or mythological) is not the sole basis of gender in Tiwi, however.
Physical size and shape are the factors controlling the assignment of gender to
inanimate things, the semantic features correlated with masculine gender being
‘small’, ‘straight’, ‘thin’, and those correlated with feminine gender being ‘large’,
‘round’, ‘ample’. The same features are used to assign gender to animals whose
sex is not known either from direct observation or from traditional mythology.
Consequently, wherever there are two similar things or animals which are distin¬
guished in Tiwi semantics as different kinds, the smaller or thinner one is classed
as masculine and the larger or broader as feminine:
FeminineMasculine
waliwalinismall antwaliwaliijalarge antmiautismall pandanusmiauiijalarge pandanusmutjkwanismall stone axemuijkwaijalarge stone axematjianismall stickmatjla^alarge sticklutjkwalUinarrow headed spearauawuniijkui broad headed spearupuniblade of grassuputjagrassAll trees are feminine (except in some cases when not fully grown) because they
are large, round and ample compared with mere sticks, which are all masculine.
Logs, pieces of bark, bark baskets and bark canoes are also all feminine, because
of their connection with tree trunks. All boats and ships are feminine presumably
because they are placed in the same category as bark canoes. Parts of the body are
of the same gender as their possessor, except for the genital organs, which are
invariably of the opposite gender to the possessor.
The semantic basis of the human and non-human categories is self-evident,
except that certain animals which are closely associated with humans come in the
former category. The animals concerned include palarjamwani, ‘dog’ (and all other
words meaning ‘dog’), tajamini, ‘dingo’, and muani, ‘goanna . The special association
of dogs and dingoes with man is obvious, but it is not clear why goannas should
also be placed in the ‘human’ category.","[63, 64, 65, 66, 67]"

Goal orientation is the process for forming a phrase consisting of two nominals,
which are related to one another in deep structure as action and goal, the two being
juxtaposed in either order without any case inflexion or other overt mark of their
relationship.
ijaputjkajqjini Jlaraka
a good hunter of wallaby
good hunter
wallaby
praka
rjapu^kauajini
a good hunter of wallaby
wallaby good hunter
This type of phrase may be regarded as derived by a nominalisation process from an
underlying sentence in which there is a verb corresponding to the action nominal,
e.g. fjapuijkauajini j[araka ‘a good hunter of wallaby’ from auapimi iaraka ‘He kills
wallabies’.
3.2 Verb phrases
The only type of verb phrase recognised in this description is the Periphrastic verb
phrase. Verb modification was dealt with in the description of sentences and thus
no head-modifier type of verb phrase is set up here.
Verbal meanings may be expressed in Tiwi either by a bound form (a verb stem),
e.g. ^akupauli ‘go back’, -ajjauaya ‘talk’, -kauawala ‘sing’, or by a free form (a verbal
noun), e.g.joi ‘dance’, ani ‘give’, kutupi ‘jump’. There is no general rule for assigning
one type of expression rather than the other to any particular verbal meaning and
it even happens sometimes that a particular meaning is expressed in both ways,
by a synonymous pair of forms, one bound and one free, e.g. -aija-iaya ‘talk’, and
namara ‘talk’, -akauai ‘give’ and ani ‘give’. Usually, however, a verbal meaning is
expressed in one way or the other, not in both.
The main difference between these two kinds of verbal form is the way in which
grammatical concepts such as person, tense and mood can be assigned to them.
In the case of the bound stems, grammatical concepts are combined with the stem
directly by af^ation, but, in the case of the free verbal stems (verbal nouns, as they
are called in this description), direct affixation is not possible, as these forms are
entirely uninflected, and an auxiliary verb has to be introduced as the means of
carrying the grammatical information. The construction which results from this
combination of verbal noun and auxiliary verb is called a Periphrastic verb phrase.
The Periphrastic verb phrase is thus a structure consisting of two functional slots
— Nucleus (filled by a verbal noun) and Auxiliary (filled by an auxiliary verb),
in that order.

ijadimi
I danced
dance I-did
'mwauliki

namara

he-dur-dopiuamaj[iri
they-did-recipHe’s swimming
They talked to one anotherThere are four auxiliary verb stems-mi, -ma, -pi and -kauimi, (all of which may
be translated ‘do’) — and the verbal nouns fall into four classes according to their
co-occurrence with one or other of the stems. There appears to be no way of
predicting the class of a verbal noun from its form or meaning.","[90, 91]"

1.3 Ordering
Word order is generally very flexible in Australian languages owing to their greater
dependence on alternative means of expressing syntactic relations — especially
concord and context — and Tiwi is typical in this respect. But, although flexible
to some extent, Tiwi word order is still far from being entirely free. Order is not
fixed, but there are norms, and rules governing departure from these norms.
Variations of order are permitted, but only on a principled basis, not just as a matter
of indifference.
The order of subject and predicate
The normal order of subject and predicate is SP.
S
P
kmupurani jinuu'ui
Kujupurani came
S
JlaparaP
J(uunaiS
tamdraMpawaijaiP
pitjafound WaijaiA woollybutt is no goodBut this order may be reversed when S is not the theme of the sentence.
P
jinuu'jiS
kujupuraniKuJupurani camePS
jluu{jaiwaijaijaparaP
jiipaS
tamarauiijaX^P^ra found WaijaiA woollybutt is no goodThe difference of meaning between SP and PS can be understood in terms of
the concept of ‘theme’ introduced by Halliday (Halliday 1967). Theme is not a
syntactic concept, but refers to the level at which the information content of the
sentence is organised, and means, roughly, ‘the thing being talked about’. It always
comes first in a sentence, regardless of its syntactic function. In a Tiwi sentence
such as jarakati jiikauimi mampupa ‘Jorakati made canoes’, for example, the subject
jarakati is placed first because it is functioning as theme, that is, the speaker introduces
jarakati first as the thing he is talking about, and then goes on to say something about
this theme — namely that he made canoes. In the reversed sentence, however,
mamputja JUkauimi jarakati, the speaker introduces the object mampupa ‘canoes’
as his theme, and information about who made them is then treated as a mere ampli¬
fication of this topic. The theme structure is reversed although the syntactic structure
remains the same, apart from order. Usually a subject which is being announced
for the first time in a discourse is treated as theme, but, having been thus announced,
it can then be relegated to an amplificatory role, if it is not deleted altogether. This
fact is the basis of one of the commonest Tiwi stylistic devices, the balanced coupling
of a pair of mirror-image sentences, e.g. jauua jiikipa kwoka, kwoka jiikipa autjira
jimpaulitja jama ‘XsJua cracked xamia nuts, she cracked xamia nuts that womanXsjua’.
The inversion of the non-verbal sentence is usually accompanied by the insertion
of a pronoun subject, owing to the absence of a subject prefix in the non-verbal
predicate.
P
S
para mamtipa purukupajli
Purukupaili (is) boss
P
para jipwati
P
parapijualiniS
japkanapki
S
japaraXaflksnagki (had) some honey
X^P^r^ (was) beautiful63
Another common feature of inverted sentences is the insertion of a demonstrative
in the subject phrase.
P
lihjaS
aufjiraP
auikulanitomarajitjaS
awara(It’s) no good, that woollybuttpurikikini(He was) big, that PurikikiniThe motivation for these devices is to signal structure and to distinguish forms
which would otherwise be homophonous. For example, the sentence murukupwaja
pumpuka ‘the girl (is) nice’ is distinguished from the phrase pumpuka murukupwaja
‘a nice girl’ solely by order. If the former were inverted no formal signal of structural
difference would remain. If a demonstrative is inserted in the subject phrase, however,
the structure becomes clear, as pumpuka aunira murukupwaja ‘(She’s) nice, that
girl’ cannot be mistaken for a modifier-head construction.
The order of verb and object
In the transitive verbal sentence the normal order of verb and object is ’VO.
S
V
ajikulani juuj(iara
S
jimpajlinaO
ijaruwaniThe old man told his brotherV
O
tiimaru'ji puni^kapaThe woman took the meatThis order may be reversed, however, provided S is either deleted, pronominalised
or moved to sentence-final position.
O

pujdmapapaV
pujamarjapakukuniThey drank the water
They drank the waters
kakuijluwiSp„Owutakukuni pujamaijapaVThe children drank the waterS
kakuijluwiThe children drank the waterAt this point it may be useful to summarise the combinations of S, V and O
permitted by the bracketing rules and constraints on inversion. These are: SVO,
VOS, OVS, SV, VO, OV, VS, V. The combinations excluded are SOV, VSO and OSV.
No doubt occasional instances of each of these might be found, but their probability
of occurrence and level of acceptability are very low. SO, OS, S and O are also
excluded, of course, as these are regarded as only fragments of sentences. Examples
of the permitted sequences are given below.
mampurjaJarakati made canoes
Jarakati made canoesOVSmampurja j3r3kati
mampurja jiik3jimi j'3r3katiSVj3r3kati jiik3jimiJarakati made themVOjiik3jimiHe made canoesmampurja jiik3jimiHe made canoesVSj'iik3jirm j'3r3katiJarakati made themVjiik3JimiHe made themSVOj3r3kati jiik3jimiVOSjiik3jimimampurjaJarakati made canoesAn alternative method of expressing object in surface structure is its incorporation
within the verb as a bound nominal stem, immediately preceding the verb stem,
e.g. ijd-J3-mari-ijiliwat}Ji3ij-u'ji ‘I took the wallaby’ (I-lk-with-wallaby-go),
a-wur}iiij3-mari-panir}3- mu ‘He’s got some meat’ (he-dur-with-meat-sit). Incor¬
poration has its limitations, however, as the number of forms which can be incor¬
porated in the object slot is quite limited, and, apart from those referring to parts64
of the body, tend to be generic rather than specific in meaning. For example, there is
an incorporated form for ‘fish’ in general, one for ‘bird’ in general, one for ‘shellfish’
in general, and so on, but none referring to particular species of fish, birds or shellfish.
For this reason, it is usual not to incorporate an object until specific reference to
it has been made liy a free nominal. For example, a sentence like li-i-mari-kBidmauipu'ji ‘She took the cooked bird’, would almost certainly be preceded by a sentence
containing specific reference to the bird, e.g. aunaijka lu-wurjld-raum-ani, jli-i-marik^Tpmajip-u'ji ‘She was cooking a goose, then she took the cooked bird away’.
(See Morphology 1.2 for a full account of the incorporation of stems into the verb.)
The expression of structural relations
It is commonly believed that structural identification of subject and object is achieved
either by case inflexion or by fixed word order, and that therefore languages which
are without one must have the other. Tiwi, however (like many other Australian
languages), has neither case inflexion nor fixed word order, and yet manages to avoid
structural ambiguity, and it is thus a matter of some interest to observe how this
is achieved. SVO and OVS both occur. How are they distinguished?
The means which are used are as follows: (1) normality of order, (2) phonological
signals, (3) concord, (4) seicctional restrictions, (5) knowledge of the cultural/situational
context.
As already stated, Tiwi word order although not fixed is not entirely free. Every
structure has a normal order, and departures from this are governed by bracketing
rules and other constraints. SVO is a normal order and OVS an inverted one, and,
for this reason, given no other structural cues of any kind, a native speaker of Tiwi
will interpret a sentence such as jardkati juutjai kuuupurani as ‘Jarakati found
Kujupurani’ not ‘Kujupurani found Jarakati’. When any danger of structural
ambiguity arises the normal order is always reverted to in order to avoid this.
Phonological signals, too, play an important part in the interpretation of sentence
structure, principally as an indication of inversion. When the order of subject and
predicate is reversed, a distinct pause may occur following the predicate phrase,
signalling that the predicate ends at this point and that the subject is only added for
amplification. For example, in a sentence such as kujupurani juu^ai, jarakati ‘Jarakati
found Kujupurani’, the pause after the predicate phrase signals the bracketing,
showing kujupurani to be object and jarakati subject.
Concord between the verb and the nominals related to it as subject and object
is another of the main means of signalling structure. As verbs include information
about the person, number and gender of both subject and object, subject and object
nominals which differ in any one of these respects can be easily distinguished. For
example, in the sentence waijai iuutjai lapara ‘Japara found Waijai’, Waijai (the
woman) is identified as object, no matter in what order the words are arranged, by
the initial prefix on the verb, /«-, which indicates third-person singular subject acting
on third-person singular feminine object. Concord is thus a sufficient means of
distinguishing subject and object, even without the assistance of order and phonology,
except, of course, when subject and object arc of the same person, number and
gender.
Selectional restrictions on the choice of nominals as subject and object also play
a great part, especially a severe restriction on the use of inanimate nominals as
subject of a transitive sentence. For example, the sentence jikwani juurjau purikikini
‘Purikikini threw fire’, can only be interpreted in one way, no matter in what order
the words are arranged, because the interpretation ‘Fire threw Purikikini’ is
semantically deviant, and precluded by selectional restrictions.
Finally, knowledge of the cultural/situational context is of the greatest importance
in the structural interpretation of sentences, and would, in fact, often be sufficient
for interpreting them even if all other means were absent. Take for instance the
inverted sentence lapara jipuijipa purukupajli ‘Purukupaali hit J^P^ra in the eye’.
In this case order, concord and selectional restrictions all fail to distinguish subject
and object (as the order is inverted and the two nominals have the same person.","[77, 78, 79, 80]"
"59
Being entirely without inflexion for person, tense, etc., they cannot stand alone as
predicate but have to be supported by an auxiliary verb which conveys the necessary
grammatical information (e.g. ani auimi ‘he gives’, literally ‘give he-does’).
Predicatives are words with adjective-like meaning (e.g. jitana ‘sick’, paj^wani
‘hungry’, pujluki ‘thirsty’), but which lack the morphological structure of adjectives
and the capacity of adjectives to function as modifier in a head-modifier construction,
and are restricted to predicative function (e.g. kiijlini jitana ‘the baby (is) sick’,
ijia pauawani ‘I (am) hungry’).
Adverbs are words which function as a verb modifier. These are subdivided into
temporal, locative and manner adverbs (e.g. patjari ‘tomorrow’, maji^ara ‘on this
side’, mamana ‘quietly’).
Interjections are words which do not have any syntactic role in sentence structure
but occur in isolation (e.g. aja ‘hey!’, a'yi ‘oh!’, kuwa ‘yes’).
Pronouns are words which stand for a noun, in the sense that they can be used to
replace a noun in most of its syntactic functions. They have no lexical meaning,
however, and are restricted to expressing the grammatical concepts such as person,
number and gender, which are abstracted from the noun. They are subdivided into
personal pronouns (e.g. ijia ‘T, tjara ‘he’), demonstrative pronouns (e.g. ya'ni ‘that one’,
tjanaijki ‘this one’), interrogative pronouns (e.g. kuwani ‘who?’, kamini ‘what?’) and
negative pronouns (e.g. karakuwani ‘no one’, karakamini ‘nothing’).
The negative adverbs are kau'lu and ajnuijkwa, which are freely interchangeable,
both meaning ‘not’. The tense markers are waija ‘past’ and wi ‘future’. The introducers,
whose function is to introduce paragraphs and serve as signals of discourse structure,
are ki, au and amantia. The conjunctions, which are all subordinating, are kari
‘when’, pili ‘because’, and ijani, a general subordinator with no specific meaning.
The prepositions (of which there are only two — kapi and kayi) function as general
relators in relator-axis phrases, e.g. kapi tiijata ‘to the beach’, kayi tiijuwini ‘in a
hollow tree’. Neither has any specific locational/directional meaning and either
may be translated ‘to’, ‘at’, ‘on’, ‘in’, ‘by’, etc., indifferently. Specific locational/
directional meanings have to be expressed by locative adverbs such as jila'ju ‘below’,
kaji'u ‘above’, e.g. jipaputi kaui'u kapi jutjuijkwa ‘he went up above, to the sky’.
1SENTENCES1.1 Predication
Predication, the basic sentence-forming process, is the deep structural relation of
a noun phrase as subject with a verbal or non-verbal phrase as predicate.
Sentence -> SP
Predication may be either verbal (expressing an action of the subject) or non-verbal
(expressing a state or quality of the subject).the baby (is)hungryVerbal predication may be either intransitive or transitive, intransitivity selecting
an intransitive verb as predicate and transitivity selecting a transitive verb with a
noun phrase object.","[74, 75]"

Two kinship terms which are placed in apposition have to have the same referent,
of course. In the final example above ijinjla mduani is ‘your son’ for a man and ^ia
mwauti is ‘my son’ for a woman.
Both slots in the construction (Identifier and Definer) may be filled by a nominal
phrase of any type, including another appositional phrase.

to a demonstrative.

‘That one Jarakati did it’, ijara purukupauli ijunantani jiikauimi ‘He Purukupajli
the bereaved man did it’, and so on.
3.1.4 Possessor orientation
Possessor orientation means the relating of a nominal to another nominal which
stands as its possessor, the two being juxtaposed in the order possessor-possessed
without any case inflexion or other overt mark of their relationship.

"Part ThreeDICTIONARYtINTRODUCTION
The dictionary consists of Tiwi-English and English-Tiwi alphabetical lists and a
short thesaurus (a semantic classification of the nouns). Alphabetical lists, although
necessary for the purpose of reference, convey nothing of the range or structure of
a people’s experience, and the thesaurus has been added in the hope of remedying
this deficiency. It should give the reader at least some idea of the kind of world the
Tiwi live in, and of the way in which they see themselves and organise their lives.
The writer’s aim throughout was to present the vocabulary as far as possible as it
was before extensive culture contact began, by the exclusion of almost all the foreign
words which are used by the Tiwi today. Tiwi knowledge of the outside world dates
mainly from about 1900, and, since that time, a great many new words have been
acquired to deal with this new body of experience. Some of these new words are loan
words acquired either from English or from Jiwadja (the mainland tribe through
whom Tiwi knowledge of the outside world was initially acquired), and others are
new formations derived by existing processes from native Tiwi elements. Some English
loan words, for example, are pmuki ‘smoke’, tilipi ‘tea leaf’, Jlukwa ‘sugar’, Jlinikini
‘sneak up’, paki ‘tobacco’, pwajiki ‘swag’, mariti ‘married’, and waki ‘work’. Some
words from Jiwadja are kapala ‘boat’, palijara ‘mast’, pmpala ‘sail’, kuli ‘rudder’,
iipi'lu ‘playing cards’, p'/w ‘matches’, kurampali ‘house’, kupli ‘door’ and walimani
‘steel axe’. (Some of these Jiwadja loan words were in turn borrowed by the Jiwadja
from the Macassans in the nineteenth century — e.g. pra ‘paper’, from Malay or
Macassarese surat, and pmpala ‘sail’, from Macassarese sampala.) Some examples of
words newly formed from native Tiwi elements are ajikatBraputai ‘cross’, ampajakitikimi
‘trigger’, apaputi ‘steps’, papupkarimia ‘looking glass’, papapukia ‘hair oil’,
papanipimapapa ‘cup’, and papupkariparaja ‘towel’. Altogether, there must be
hundreds of such culture contact words in the current vocabulary but, apart from a
few very common ones, these were excluded from the present dictionary for the reason
stated above.
The vocabulary is naturally very small compared with that of any European
language owing to the far greater range of demands made on the latter. Obviously
a language which is used by a very large number of people for a very wide variety of
purposes is bound to have many more words than one which is used by a tiny group
of people for a very limited range of purposes. English, for example, has a vast number
of literary, learned, technical and scientific terms, and Tiwi naturally has nothing
corresponding to these. The 2000 or so words collected in the present dictionary
undoubtedly represent a substantial part of the Tiwi vocabulary, as is easy to tell
from the difficulty of collecting more. However, it should be stressed that the everyday
vocabulary of the average speaker of English is probably no larger than that of the
average speaker of Tiwi. The English speaker has access to a very much larger
vocabulary but he does not generally make much use of it.
The most obvious general characteristic of the vocabulary is its concreteness. To
take some examples at random, there are no Tiwi equivalents to abstract nouns such
as ‘size’, ‘shape’, ‘texture’, ‘colour’, ‘quality’, ‘quantity], or to generic terms such as
‘animal’, ‘mammal’, ‘marsupial’, ‘vegetable’, ‘plant’, ‘limb’, ‘organ’. Although there
are names for many species of birds, reptiles and shellfish, there arc no generic terms
meaning ‘bird’, ‘reptile’ or ‘shellfish’, and, although there arc narnes for a variety of
weapons, tools and implements, there are no generic terms meaning ‘weapon], ‘tool’
or ‘implement’. Also, there are no general colour words other than two which can
be loosely translated ‘black’ and ‘white’, but these refer to the dark-light dimension
of contrast, not to the colour spectrum.
Perhaps it should be added, in ca.se any reader should draw wrong conclusions
from the foregoing remarks, that the small size and concreteness of the Tiwi vocabulary
should not be taken as evidence of the general primitiveness of the language. Tiwi
grammar is so far from primitive, in fact, that it took the writer several years to unravel118
its intricacies. The verb morphology and morphophonology, in particular, is a device
of incredible cornplexity and sophistication which can be used to express a wide range
of subtle distinctions with great precision and economy. The reader who has mistaken
notions about ‘primitive’ languages has to be told that he could never, by any con¬
ceivable expenditure of time and intellectual effort, attain the degree of fluency in
the use of this device which is possessed by the older Tiwi. The subtlety and precision
of their thought, as exhibited in their use of this very complex system of rules, is equal
to anything found in European languages.
Another interesting feature of the vocabulary to which the reader’s attention should
be drawn is its provision of two, three, or sometimes even four names for most of
the more important things in the Tiwi world. For example, ‘crocodile’ is jaraykspai,
jaratjkapijluni, tajuni or takampurja (with no distinction of meaning), ‘dog’ is
palaijamwani, katariijani, waijkini or pamulampur^ini, and ‘barbed spear’ is ajawunipkui,
tilipajiya or toyontilau. This proliferation of synonyms is not a luxury, as in English,
but a necessity arising from the Tiwi practice of placing a taboo on not only the names
of dead people, ljut also on all common nouns or other words which resemble these
names phonologically. In most cases one of the names of a thing has favourite status,
but, if this becomes taboo, the existence of synonyms means that another name is
always available to take its place.
For the purpose of alphabetising, the letters of the Tiwi alphabet are arranged in
the following order: a, i, j, k, 1, m, n, n, p, o, p, r, j, t, %, u, w, y. a is
treated merely as a variant of i, as these cannot be distinguished phonologically,
although both are used for the sake of phonetic realism.
Nouns are marked m or f (masculine or feminine) to indicate their gender, verbs
and incorporated stems are marked I, Ila or Ilb to indicate their morphophonological
class, and verbal nouns are marked -mi, -ma or -kajimi to indicate the auxiliary verb
stem which they require. For other abbreviations see Symbols and Abbreviations,

This work, which consists of a Tiwi grammar, a collection of texts and a dictionary,
was begun in 1966 when the writer was a research scholar in Aboriginal Linguistics
at the University of Queensland, continued during 1967-70 at the University of
London, and completed in 1971-72 during a second period of field work in Australia.
It was supported throughout by grants from the Australian Institute of Aboriginal
Studies. The writer is most grateful to the Institute both for this support and for
the cooperation which they gave in all other matters.
An earlier version of the grammar was submitted for a Ph.D. at the University
of London in 1970, and this was supervised in part by R.M.W. Dixon and in part
by R.D. Huddleston. Both gave much good advice and encouragement, and I wish
to thank them both for the many valuable improvements in the work which resulted
from their suggestions.
Thanks are also due to the Welfare Division of the Northern Territory Adminis¬
tration and to Bishop J. O’Loughlin for their permission to work on Melville and
Bathurst Islands and for the assistance which they gave in all matters connected
with the work.
The success of my periods of field work on Melville and Bathurst Islands — nine
months in 1966-67 and twelve months in 1971-72 — depended very greatly on the
cooperation of the superintendents of the settlements at which I stayed. I have to
thank Father John Fallon, Acting Superintendent of Bathurst Island Mission during
my stay there, and Jack Doolan and Ian Rodger, Superintendents of Snake Bay
Welfare Settlement at different periods, for their unfailing hospitality and cooperation
during the time I spent with them.
I am also indebted to Dr Maria Brandi for her kindness in devoting some of her
valuable time to helping me to check some of my material.
The heaviest debt of all of course is to the informants, who actually gave me the
material and taught me their language, and especially to Laurie Nelson (i[ukuliai]3nila),
Geoffrey Mungatopi (qapilimuquraja), Tobias Pilakwi (Juwujti), and Big Don
(purupumaliua), who between them bore the main burden of many months of hard
informant work with great patience and endurance. Their deep knowledge of the
language and the perceptive way in which they explained it to me were the basis
on which the description was built.","[8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]"

3.2 Emphatic pronouns
Emphatic pronouns, somewhat similar in function to the English emphatic forms
‘myself’, ‘yourself’, etc., are formed by adding a suffix -ila to the basic personal
pronouns listed above. Both -ila and the pronominal stems undergo morphophonological changes in combining, but these changes are not described as all the emphatic
forms are listed below.
yaw ila
ourselves (we ex)
t]ilawa
myself
nuila
yourselves
fjiniila
yourself
wutawa
themselves
ijatawa
himself
yawila
ourselves (we inc)
ffitawa
herself
muwila
ourselves (you sg and I)
Note that the emphatic forms, like the basic forms, may have any syntactic function
— e.g., subject, object or possessor — as they are unmarked for case:
ijilawa i]3-pa-kdMmi
I’ll do it myself
myself I-fut-do
kuwani ji-i-k3jimi? pir}Jiila?
Who did it? You?

he-lk-do

Ijiuiila

bossyour boss3.3 Possessive pronouns
Possessive pronouns, which are the translation equivalent of English ‘ipy’» ‘your’,
etc., or of ‘mine’, ‘yours’, etc., depending on whether they are used attributively or
predicatively, are formed by adding a class prefix ydtti-, ‘masculine’, ayi-, ‘feminine’,
or kapi-, ‘plural’, to the emphatic forms listed in 3.2.

replace or to which they stand in an attributive or predicative relation;

jimpajliya ayiy^ila
yaniyilawa pumpuniThe male one is mine
The female is yours
Mine is goodBoth the basic personal pronouns and the possessive pronouns can be used as
possessor and the difference between them can be suggested by the difference be¬
tween English ‘my’ and ‘my own’, e.g., yawa pajlini, ‘our custom’, yaniyawila
pojlini, ‘our own custom’.
The plural prefix kapi- has a variant yampi-, e.g., yampiyilawa, ‘my own ones’,
instead of kapiyilawa.","[70, 71]"

1.4 Restrictions on occurrence
There are various restrictions on the occurrence of the phonemes relative to word
boundaries and stem boundaries and these are stated below. Restrictions on the
occurrence of the phonemes relative to syllable boundaries are given in section 2.
The restrictions on the occurrence of the consonants are as follows; (a) no
consonant may occur in word-final position; (b) one group of consonants —
/, r
and y — never (or rarely) occur in word-initial position; (c) another group — the
nasals n, n and ij — have their word-initial occurrences almost entirely restricted
to one or two small classes of morphemes; (d) p, k, m and w are the only consonants
which may occur initially in verb stems.
The restriction on the occurrence of r and y is absolute, as no word in the lexicon
begins with either of these two phonemes. (The form ri'tjani, ‘father’, begins with r,
but kinship terms are always so closely related to the obligatory personal pronoun
which precedes them that they have to be regarded as bound forms. The point is
that ri'ijani can never occur by itself and so r never occurs initially in the utterance.)
The restriction on the occurrence of u and /, on the other hand, is not absolute,
as there is a tiny percentage (much less than one per cent in each case) of words
which begin with these phonemes, for example mtu'wati, ‘island’, uu'wuti, ‘heart’,
lanika'pini, ‘smoke’. The Tiwi find considerable difficulty in saying word-initial j,
and, in the few words in which this phoneme occurs initially, it is often preceded
by a slight introductory vocalic glide. Thus uatu'wati, for example, is often pro¬
nounced [ajati/wati]. The introductory glide in these cases has no phonemic status
but is merely a conditioned feature of u in this position.
It is evident, from the restriction on their occurrence, that j, /, r and y have some
kind of secondary status as consonants in Tiwi. What they have in common, from
an articulatory point of view, is absence of a complete closure, and perhaps it is this
which disqualifies them for word-initial use. Historically, it may be that these
phonemes were a late development in the history of proto-Australian, resulting
from phonemic splitting in intervocalic position, and that their use has never become
more generalised.
The word-initial occurrences of tj, n and ij are almost entirely restricted to personal
pronouns, subject prefixes, certain pronominal prefixes, conjunctions and preposi¬
tions, in much the same way (and for much the same reason) that word-initial d
is restricted to pronouns and articles in English. The effect of the restriction is to
distinguish nominals (which rarely begin with n, n or rj) from verbs, pronouns, and
particles, which often do. The number of nominals beginning with n, n or rj is very
small — in each case less than one per cent of the total inventory of nominals in
the lexicon. Some examples are ni'ijani, ‘spirit’, namatja'rau, ‘red ochre’, and
ija'jiija, ‘black cockatoo’.
The restrictions on the occurrence of the vowels are as follows: (a) word-initial
position — a is the only vowel to occur at all frequently in word-initial position.
/ and o do not occur word-initially, and u does so only very infrequently (e.g., in
u'puija, ‘grass’, u'pwani, ‘fly’). Word-initial ji can be mistaken for i as the semi¬
vowel is difficult to perceive in this environment. Morphophonological changes of
the vowel, however, make the semi-vowel quite apparent. For example, j is difficult
to perceive in the third-person prefix ji- as in ji-i-ka'uimi, ‘He did it’, but quite obvious
when the vowel is changed as in ju-'apa, ‘He ate’. The presence of J in Ji- is proved
by its presence in Ju- as there would be no way of accounting for the alternation
i-'^ju-; (b) word-final position — unstressed word-final vowel is restricted to i or a,
though u may occur in word-final stressed syllables. This restriction is a means of
marking word-final boundaries.j,1.5 Statistical data
The statistical data assembled in this section is intended to provide evidence of
significant differences of functional load between the phonemes, where such differences
exist. The data is of two kinds — list-frequency data and text-frequency data —16
the first providing information about the frequency of occurrence of the phonemes
in a word list and the second information about their frequency of occurrence in
texts. The two sets of figures may differ considerably in places because of the in¬
fluence of the morpheme frequency factor on the text frequency figures for phonemes.
The list frequency figures are based on a list of 1000 words of all classes and the
text frequency figures on a text of 500 words. The margin of error attributable to
accidental features of the sample is probably in the region of one or two per cent —
that is, any given figure would probably not be more than two per cent different
if based on a different sample of the same size. The figures of less than one per cent
would have a much smaller sampling error. All the figures given are percentages
of the total of consonants or vowels occurring in the relevant position.
Consonants
The data on the consonants give information on their overall frequency of occur¬
rence and on the frequency of their occurrence in word-initial and non-initial positions.

Non-verbal predication, which is effected by mere juxtaposition, without a copula,
selects a noun, noun phrase, adjective or predicative as predicate and expresses one
of three different meanings — equational (x is y), possessive (x has y), and attributive
(x has the attribute y).

by the different manifesting class of P, as attributive sentences have an adjective
or predicative as predicate and equational and possessive sentences have a noun
or noun phrase as predicate. Equational and possessive sentences are not differentiated
structurally in any way, however (e.g. purukupajli majntina might mean either
‘Purukupajli (is) boss’ or ‘Purukupajli (has) a boss’), and have to be distinguished
in other ways. The distinction is effected primarily by selectional criteria, as, in the
equational sentence, where the two nominals have the same referent, there is
necessarily concord on the animate-inanimate, human-non-human and masculinefeminine dimensions. Where this selectional congruity between S and P is absent,
it is evident that the relation between them cannot be one of equivalence, and therefore
must be one of possession. For example, kakUiluwi jirjwati (literally ‘children honey’)
can only be understood as ‘The children (have) the honey’ as selectional constraints
exclude ‘The children (are) the honey’ (S is animate, human and plural while P is
inanimate, non-human and singular).
Ambiguity arises only in those sentences in which selectional congruity exists
between S and P, but these can usually be interpreted correctly through knowledge
of the cultural and situational context. For example, purikikini pakilij^ipa might mean61
either ‘Purikikini (was) a young man prepared for initiation’ or ‘Purikikini (had)
a young man prepared for initiation’. Only knowledge of the cultural context makes
it clear that the latter is the meaning intended.
The time reference of non-verbal sentences has to be inferred from the context,
as they are not marked for tense in any way.
1.2 Deletion and pronominalisation
Both subject and object may be deleted in surface structure, independently of one
another, and the deletion of either is virtually obligatory when it is supplied by the
linguistic or extra-linguistic context — for example in a non-initial sentence in a
sequence of sentences having the same referent as subject or object in deep structure,
or in a situation in which identification of the subject is achieved by pointing or
looking at the referent.

may be pronominalised — that is, a pronoun expressing the grammatical concepts
abstracted from it may be substituted for it and fill its syntactic function. Subject
is pronominalised much more readily than object, and, while subject may be either
a personal pronoun or a demonstrative, pronoun object is nearly always a demon¬
strative.

He made itThe use of a pronoun substitute for a deleted subject or object is optional, however,
as every verb in any case incorporates obligatory pronominal reference to subject
and every transitive verb also incorporates obligatory pronominal reference to
object. For example, the verb jipampuna means ‘He followed him’ and is a sentence
by itself. Nothing is added to the meaning of the sentence by the use of separate
pronouns, as in ijara Jipampuna awara ‘He followed him’. The Tiwi do in fact often
use separate pronouns for subject and object, but their use is quite superfluous from
the point of view of syntax, and, as a matter of style, they tend to be avoided in
sentences in which the verb is rather long.
Even in non-verbal sentences (which have no pronominal reference to the subject
within the predicate phrase) the use of a pronoun substitute for a deleted thirdperson subject is not obligatory, as the subject can usually be inferred from the
context. For example, ‘He’s dead’ may be either tjara pajutjwani or just paju^wani
‘dead’, and ‘It’s good’ is just pumpuni ‘good’, ‘It’s bad’ just Jluti ‘bad’, and so on.
In the possessive type of non-verbal sentence, however, pronominal substitution for
a deleted subject is necessary, e.g. ijara Jiijajti ‘He (has) a lot’ as contrasted with
Ji^ajti ‘(There is) a lot’.","[75, 76, 77]"

1PHONEMES1.1 Phonemic systems1.1.1 Consonant system
The Tiwi consonant system is a quite normal example of the general Australian
type. This type has a maximum of six places of articulation — bilabial, dental,
alveolar, alveo-palatal, retroflex and velar — but not all of these are used contrastively in every language. In many languages dental and alveo-palatal sounds are
merged in a single phoneme, and, in some, alveolar and retroflex sounds are
similarly merged. There are thus some languages with four, some with five, and
some with six contrastive places of articulation. There is always a complete set
of nasals, with one nasal corresponding to every stop. In addition there are always
at least one lateral, an alveolar flap, a retroflex vocoid, and two semi-vowels (palatal
and velar). There are generally no fricatives and features of a secondary type such
as voice, aspiration, aflfrication, velarisation and glottalisation are not used contrastively. The result is a fairly simple system with usually not more than about
fourteen to eighteen consonants. (See Capell, 1956 and 1962 for an account of the
common Australian consonant system, and for some examples of the type.)
The Tiwi system is one of those which have only four contrastive places of articu¬
lation, dental and alveo-palatal sounds being merged in a single phoneme, and
similarly alveolar and retroflex. It differs from the norm in one trivial respect —
the possession of a single fricative phoneme.
There are fourteen consonant phonemes, as follows: four stops — bilabial, jpj,
dental, /i/, alveolar, ///, and velar, /^/; four nasals with corresponding places of
articulation — bilabial, /m/, dental, /«/, alveolar, /«/, and velar, //;/; an alveolar
lateral, ///; an alveolar flap, /r/; a velar fricative, /y/; a retroflex vocoid, /i/; and
two semi-vowels — palatal, ///, and velar, jwj.

of the palatal semi-vowel in the ‘dental’ column and of the retroflex vocoid in the10
‘alveolar’ column, as ‘palato-dental’ and ‘alveolar-retroflex’ are in fact single places
of articulation in Tiwi.)
Minimal or near minimal pairs are given below for those contrasts which may
seem less obvious.
/// — ///Iman'tafjal, ‘woman friend’, jman'jlatjal, ‘a stick’./«/ — luljni'tjanil, ‘today’, Ini'tjaml, ‘spirit’.lyl — /W‘we inc.’, j'^awaj, ‘we ex.’.jrj — /j/lan'jloral, ‘wallaby’, Iji'^ouaj, ‘cabbage palm’.
NOTES1. Treatment of alveo-palatal sounds
It should be noted here, with regard to the apparent absence in Tiwi of the series
usually labelled ‘alveo-palatal’ or ‘palatal’ in descriptions of Australian languages,
that the Tiwi ‘dental’ series is in fact the same series differently labelled. As already
mentioned, Tiwi is one of the many Australian languages in which dental and alveopalatal sounds are merged as members of a single phoneme. In this situation, many
linguists have chosen to identify the phoneme by its alveo-palatal member, and this
may have been the correct thing to do given the data they were describing, but, in
the case of Tiwi at least, the data suggests that the apico-dental member of the
phoneme is its basic form.
2. Treatment of retroflex sounds
Although retroflex sounds [^], [//] and [/] all occur very commonly in Tiwi no evidence
could be found which would require the setting up of a retroflex series of phonemes,
distinct from the alveolar series. The retroflex sounds never occur initially in words
or utterances. In the intervocalic positions in which they do occur it is always possible
to postulate that the retroflexion is due to the presence of an immediately preceding
/j/, and this is in fact what has been done in the present description, jut is established
by independent evidence and, as ///, jtij, and ///, (if these phonemes were set up)
would never be distinguishable from /.///, Imj, lulj, a separate retroflex series seems
redundant.
Even more compelling is the following evidence. There are a great many masculine
nominal forms such as [mi'ali], ‘pandanus’, ['mwali], ‘son’, [jiati'tjali], ‘boy’ in which
the masculine suffix -ti has an initial retroflex stop instead of the usual alveolar stop.
This fact seems an inexplicable anomaly until one considers the corresponding
feminine forms, which are [mia'ji^a], [mwa'ji^a], and [latiija'Jirja]. What these feminine
forms prove is that a morpheme boundary occurs following the retroflexion and
preceding the stop. A separate /.// phoneme is shown to be present in the masculine
forms and the retroflexion of the stop is thus shown to be merely a conditioned
feature.
3. The velar fricative
The one unusual feature of the Tiwi consonant system is its possession of a single
fricative phoneme — the voiced velar fricative, /y/ — as friction is generally not
used as a distinctive feature in Australian languages. Tiwi may not be alone, however,
in its possession of this phoneme, as the same sound appears to have been observed
in some other north Australian languages (Jiwadja and Maung; see Capell 1962:
129). The phoneme remains an isolated, unintegrated oddity in the system, however,
as there is not the slightest indication in Tiwi of the development of a systematic
stop-fricative contrast. Moreover, the very low incidence of jyj, and the restrictions
on its occurrence — it can occur only in intervocalic position — both tend to suggest
that the phoneme is a relative innovation, which may have arisen either as a result
of outside influence or by a phonemic split from jwj, and which has not yet estab¬
lished itself as an equal member of the system.
In articulatory terms /y/ is somewhat similar to jwj, as the place of articulation
is the same for both and as the rounding of the latter is generally rather slight. Both11
sounds are pronounced with the back of the tongue raised towards the soft palate
but the height of the tongue is slightly greater for /y/, producing a very narrow aper¬
ture which results in audible local friction. Unusual as it is (for an Australian
language) the contrast is not in doubt, as the two sounds occur in exactly the same
phonological environment, and one cannot be freely substituted for the other.
4. The glottal stop
Another possibility which had to be considered in the course of analysis was that
of setting up a glottal stop phoneme, as the glottal stop does in fact occur in Tiwi
and it would not be correct to say that it was without linguistic function. It has a
function, certainly, but, as this function depends on syntagmatic rather than para¬
digmatic relations, it is not of a kind that can easily be accommodated within the
framework of a phonemic description. The significance of the glottal stop in Tiwi
depends on the restriction of its occurrence to sentence-final position. It signals the
end of sentences, in fact, but, as it does this not by contrastively replacing something
else but merely by being kept in a constant position relative to the sentence, its
significance is of the kind that is best handled by prosodic theory rather than of the
kind which has traditionally been dealt with by phonemics.","[22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27]"
"5 SANDHI
Sandhi is a special type of morphophonological process in that the morphemboundary at which the process is operative is also a word boundary. The only situe
ation in which sandhi occurs in Tiwi is when unstressed word-final vowel precedes
word-initial vowel, and the only formal process for meeting this situation is the
deletion of word-final vowel:
nua -f- {fiampi + awuta
nua T}iamp awuta
you
straight
they
They are your straight ones
no^a + auijctru
other
there->notj auga'ru
Another one is thereSandhi is especially noticeable affecting personal pronouns when they occur
preceding a kinship term with initial vowel. There is a high degree of morphological
cohesion between personal pronoun and kinship term, as the latter never normally
occurs without the former, and this is reflected by a correspondingly high degree
of phonological fusion, resulting in the almost invariable loss of the final vowel of
the personal pronoun:
ijia + uwani -> iji uwani
my
brother my brother
rfira + ilimani -> pir ilimani

uncle

1VERBSTiwi verbs are sentence-words, capable of functioning as complete utterances in
themselves, and potentially expandable to a high degree of complexity by means
of affixation and noun incorporation. The verb is a layered structure having as its
nucleus a theme, to which various affixes expressing grammatical concepts such as
tense and aspect may be attached. The theme may consist simply of a verb stem
or of a verb stem preceded by one or more incorporated stems expressing lexical
concepts such as ‘fish’, ‘meat’, ‘sleep’. Each stem consists of one or more roots,
with or without derivational affixes. The study of stem structure is not attempted
in the present description, however, as this would be a matter of historical rather
than syntactic relevance. Present-day speakers of Tiwi are not aware of the morpho¬
logical structure of stems and thus, in attempting to analyse them, one would be
engaged in diachronic description rather than in explaining the currently productive
processes of the language.
An example may help to clarify the preceding description of the layered structure
of verbs. The verb ji-ni-mdni-ka-marikua^apd-pufjipa, ‘He came and hit me in the
eye while I was dancing in the evening’, consists of a theme marikua/jdpa-pu^ipa,
‘dancing —hit eye’, preceded by ji-, ‘he past’, /»-, ‘distance’, wan/-, ‘me’, and ka‘evening’. The theme consists of the verb stem -putjipa, ‘hit in the eye’, preceded by
the incorporated stem marikuaijdpd-, ‘dancing’. The internal structure of both the
stems is somewhat obscure but -puijipa probably consists of puiji-, ‘hit’, and -pa,
eye , and marikuatjapa- probably consists of mari-, ‘with’ plus obscure morphemes
kua- and ijapa-. The obscurity of the structure of the stems is indicative of the fact
that these forms are no longer felt to be morphologically composite.
1.1 Word structures
The description of the word structures consists of an account of the grammatical
concepts which are expressed in the verb (1.1.1), a list of the morphemes (1.1.2),
and an account of the ways in which the concepts are expressed, using the mor¬
phemes (1.1.3 - 1.1.13).
1.1.1 Grammatical concepts
The grammatical categories which are expressed in the verb are as follows: person,
number, gender, tense, aspect, mood, voice, location/direction, time of day, stance,
emphasis. All verbs have to express person, number and (for third-person-singular)
gender of subject, and all transitive verbs have to express person, number, and
(for third-person-singular) gender of direct object. Tense is also an obligatory category
as subject prefixes generally carry a tense meaning as well, but verbs may remain37unmarked for all the other categories. That is, there is an unmarked aspect, mood,
voice, etc., as well as a number of marked ones. The concepts in each of the categories
are stated below.
person: The system of person concepts is based on a two-dimensional scheme, one
dimension being inclusion or exclusion of the speaker(s) and the other inclusion or
exclusion of the person(s) addressed. This scheme yields a set of four persons, as
follows: first person, inclusive of speaker but exclusive of person addressed; second
person, exclusive of speaker but inclusive of person addressed; third person, exclusive
both of speaker and of person addressed; and fourth person, inclusive both of speaker
and of person addressed. The same system of persons is found both in the singular
and in the plural.
number: There are just two numbers — singular and plural — fourth person singular
being singular in the sense that there is just one speaker and one person addressed.
gender: There are just two genders — masculine and feminine. Entry into this system
is dependent on previous selection of third person and singular number.
tense: There are three tenses — non-past, past and future. The non-past tense has no
time reference in itself but may acquire present or future time reference from the
context.
aspect: There are six aspects—-unmarked, durative, repetitive, moving, beginning
and inceptive, and there is also the possibility of combining the concepts of duration,
repetition and movement, resulting in durative-repetitive and durative-repetitivemoving verbs.
mood: In addition to an unmarked indicative mood, there are imperative, subjunctive,
compulsional and incompletive moods.
voice: The marked voices are reflexive, reciprocal, collective and causative.
location/direction: The system of location concepts is simply ‘there’ and ‘here’,
and the corresponding direction concepts are ‘from there’ ‘and from here’.
time of day: The time of day concepts are morning (up to about noon) and evening
(from late afternoon).
stance: The stance concepts are standing up and walking along.
emphasis: Emphasis is restricted to imperative verbs and contrasts just with lack
of emphasis.

"Chapter TwoMORPHOPHONOLOGY
The morphophonology consists of three main sections — general processes, verb
morphophonology and nominal morphophonology, in that order — and two short
sections on enclitics and word sandhi. The verb morphophonology and nominal
morphophonology treat morpheme classes in their order of occurrence from left
to right, beginning with the first order of prefixes and ending with the last order
of suffixes, and give a full description of the variation in the form of every morpheme
of each class.
Every morpheme has a postulated underlying morphophonological representation
and one or more phonemic representations generated by morphophonological
processes. Processes which are not restricted to a particular morpheme class but
are conditioned solely by phonological factors are described in the opening section
on general processes. The verb morphophonology is rather complex (because of
the complexity of verb morphology) but the nominal morphophonology is quite
simple because of the small number of affixes involved.
The majority of the morphologically restricted processes also have some kind
of phonological motivation, and, in most cases, this is to overcome the difficulty
of combining morpheme-final vowel with morpheme-initial vowel, but other types
of phonological motivation are also apparent — e.g., consonantal dissimilation and
avoidance of excessive length. The processes used are of all possible formal types,
including insertion, deletion, replacement, permutation, and various combinations
of these, and a variety of different processes may be used for the same phonological
purpose. For example, V -I- V combination, which is very common in verb morphology,
may be dealt with (a) by merely running the two vowels together (so that they sound
like a single long vowel); (b) by linking them with an intervocalic glide, y or w;
(c) by inserting a consonant (any one of several, depending on the morphemes
concerned) between the two vowels; (d) by deletion of morpheme-final vowel;
(e) by deletion of morpheme-initial vowel; (f) by metathesis, and (g) by some
combination of vowel deletion and consonant insertion. This no doubt seems a
rather bewildering array of formal processes to deal with a single problem of com¬
bination but the variety is not entirely pointless. For example, deletion of final
vowel is mainly restricted to morphemes of more than one syllable, as, if it were
generally applied to monosyllabic morphemes, the effect would be to reduce them
to a single phoneme and this would make them more difficult to identify. The variety
of processes, moreover, has the value of distinguishing different morpheme classes,
as each class has its distinctive type of morphophonological change.
1GENERAL PROCESSES1.1 Vowel combination
The general process for combining morpheme-final vowel with morpheme-initial
vowel, which applies wherever none of the morphologically restricted processes for23
V + V apply, is the insertion of a vocalic glide between the two vowels. There are two
variants of this general process — j insertion and w insertion — the two types being
conditioned morphologically. All morphemes with initial vowel are either j
morphemes or w morphemes (i.e., take either j insertion or w insertion) and there
is no case of a morpheme taking both types, either in free or in conditioned variation.
In combination with the final vowel of a preceding morpheme, j morphemes require
the insertion of an intervening j glide and cause morpheme-final a to change to /,
while w morphemes require the insertion of an intervening w glide and cause both
morpheme-final a and i to change to u. Thus, for example, a j morpheme with initial a,
when combined with morpheme-final a, yields aja, and, when combined with
morpheme-final a, ija; while a w morpheme with initial a, when combined with
the same phonemes, yields awa and uwa respectively. In many cases the j or w letter
can be omitted from the spelling forms as the vowel combination can be read in
only one way — e.g., ia and ua are much neater than ija and uwa and quite
unambiguous — and this is generally done in the examples which follow.
Examples of J insertion
Ca- -f- -akupauli -> ta-jakupauli
imp

pa- -f- ka- -t- -inti -> pa-ja-ki-inti
I

pa- + marikuapapa- -f -akalawini -> pa-ua-marikuapapi-apkalawipi
I
dance
see
I saw him dancing
(Note that (1) /q/o/ is phonetically [eja] owing to the raising of jaj preceding ///;
(2) ua- is inserted by a morphophonological process described in 2.2; (3) the inter¬
vocalic glide is not represented in the transcription except where this is unavoidable.)
Examples of w insertion

tellpu-u-nu-utiara
I’ll go and tell himMorpheme-final a is also decentralised in certain consonantal environments,
the general principle being that a changes to u in environments in which the pre¬
ceding consonant is a labial and the following consonant labial or velar, a preceding
p having a much stronger rounding effect than an m\

There is also some dissimilation, a being advanced to / in the environments k-p
and p-p, as either a or m would tend to disappear in these environments:

1.2 Prenasalisation of intervocalic stops
Many intervocalic stops (in morphemes of all kinds — both stems and affixes) are
optionally prenasalised — that is, a homorganic nasal may be inserted preceding
the stop, e.g., mauntupiiija, ‘skinny fish’,
majntumputja, papmiijata, ‘pregnant
woman’,
papujiijanta, and jdvdkdpai, ‘crocodile’,
jdrdijkdpai. The process does
not apply to all intervocalic stops, however, but only to some — e.g., pupimi, ‘good’
-> pumpuni, but kukuni, ‘water’ does not -> *ku^kuni — and there is no general
principle of any kind, either grammatical, semantic, or phonological, which could
predict the cases where the process applies. There is a general rule that the process
does not operate across a morpheme boundary, and this helps to limit the number
of cases where prenasalisation might occur, but a great many cases still remain
for which there is no general rule. It is simply necessary to learn by heart the cases
where prenasalisation may apply. In a few cases prenasalisation does even apply
across a morpheme boundary but this is only where the degree of morphological
cohesion is very high.
Nasals which are inserted optionally by the prenasalisation process have to be
distinguished from nasals which are present in the underlying morphophonological
representation of the morpheme and are therefore obligatory. For example, the
nasals in larjkdijaijki, ‘eagle’, and in mamputja, ‘bark canoe’, cannot be omitted
in any occurrence of these words, and it has to be assumed that they are present
in the morphophonological representation and are not merely inserted by an
optional prenasalisation rule.
1.3 Deletion of y and u
y and u are deleted in specific vocalic environments — y in the environment a-a
and A in the environment i-i — in all but the most careful and formal types of
pronunciation, e.g., purjintaya, ‘head’, ^ pufjintaa; aya, ‘Hey!’, ^ aa; kuijiini,
‘little boy’,
kiijlini', juikdjimi, ‘He did it’, ^ jiikajimi. Although most speakers
use the shorter forms most of the time, they remain aware of the ‘correct’ forms
(i.e., the underlying morphophonological representations) and tend to insist on
these in correcting the linguist’s pronunciation. The deletion of u in the specified
environment is not quite general but is certainly not restricted to any particular
morpheme class.
2 VERB MORPHOPHONOLOGY
The description of verb morphophonology consists of four main sections — 2.1,
prefixes, 2.2, jd- insertion, 2.3, stems, and 2.4, suffixes. 2.1 describes changes in
the forms of prefixes, 2.2 the insertion of the segment ja- preceding stems and other
changes which are dependent on this, 2.3 changes in verb stems and incorporated
stems and 2.4 changes in suffixes in combining with each other and in stems in
combining with suffixes.
Reference is made throughout the description to the three stem classes — I, Ila
and lib. These classes are defined in section 2.3.
As stated in 1.1 all mo^hemes with initial vowel are either j morphemes or w
morphemes — i.e., determine either j insertion or w insertion under the general
process for vowel combination. In verb morphology the j morphemes are the prefix
i- and Ilb stems and the w morphemes are the prefixes
ata-, u^iija- and Ila stems.
Suffixes have initial vowel but do not combine by the general process.
2.1 Prefixes
2.1.1 Subject prefixes
The subject prefixes are rja-, ‘I’, na-, ‘you sg np’, ti-, ‘you sg p’, a-, ‘he np’,y/-, ‘he p’,
a-, ‘she np’, li-, ‘she p’, mu-, ‘you sg and I’, ija-, ‘we ex’, rja-, ‘you pi’, wu-, ‘they np’,
pu-, ‘they p’, and ija-, ‘you pi and we’, and these constitute a single order. The types
of morphophonological change which affect at least some members of the class
are (a) general vowel change (described in 1.1), (b) nasal closure, and (c) deletion
of final vowel.","[37, 38, 39, 40]"
"52
2.1.2 Formal processes
Nouns do not necessarily have any overt mark of gender, although the class of
nouns is always apparent from concord with adjectives, which are invariably marked.
The means of marking both nouns and adjectives is suffixation, the masculine suffix
being -Ni and the feminine suffix -Ka. -Ni has morphologically conditioned variants
-ni and -ti, and -Ka has morphologically conditioned variants -tja and -ka, but no
explanation can be oflered for the selection of suffixes by any particular stem.
-ni and
are the more common and currently productive pair, and it seems possible
that -ti and -ka are older prefixes which have gradually been superseded. Some
examples are given below.
Masculine

mantani
palarjamwani

The approximate percentages of nouns with and without class suffixes (based
on a sample of 200 masculine nouns and 200 feminine nouns) are as follows:
Masculine
Feminine
-ni
54'0
-rja
54'0
-ti
17-0
-ka
24-5
no suffix 29 0
no suffix 21'5
There are some exceptional instances of masculine nouns with final -ya or -ka
(e.g., malakanipa, ‘young boy’, numwajijaka, ‘barbless spear’) and feminine nouns
with final -ni or -ti (e.g., kamtukuni, ‘ironwood’, pulauti, ‘woman’s breast’).
man
male friend
male dog

male goanna

mangrove worm
young man

sharkNo overt mark of any kind is used to distinguish human from non-human nouns
and (with a few exceptions) none is necessary, as the classes are obvious in any case.
Classification on this dimension is shown by concord with the numerals meaning
two and three . Each of these numerals has a human, a masculine non-human
and a feminine non-human form, as follows:
human
m. non-human
f. non-human
Iwo
juraja
jiraja
Mtaua
three
juraj[9riina
jiratdrima
laldrima
The class of every noun is known from its concord with these forms, e.g., juram
wawuruwi, two men’, jira.ta lapara, ‘two months’, jiplaja umwja, ‘two days’.
2.2 Plural forms
Plural nominals are formed by either of two methods — suffixation or reduplication
plus suffixation. Suffixation alone is by far the more common (and currently the
only productive) method, reduplication being restricted to a small number of
nominals which are listed below. Generally, only human nouns are used in the
plural, other nouns being used in the singular in all of their occurrences, e.g.,
laldrima unnaja, ‘three days’, (literally ‘three day’), taikuw'ani waliwalini, ‘many
ants (literally ‘many ant’), munikuwutja lipunukua, ‘He lined up his throwing sticks’
(literally ‘throwing stick he lined up’). As pointed out in 2.1.1, however, the ‘human’
class includes at least three animals — pdlatjamwani, ‘dog’, tajamini, ‘dingo’ and
muani, ‘goanna’ — and these are used in the plural like any other ‘human’ noun.","[67, 68]"

The word stress pattern consists of an optional Prelude and an obligatory
Nucleus, in that order, the Prelude being one or more stress groups each having
a secondary stress as its nucleus, and the Nucleus being a single stress group having
a primary stress as its nucleus;

mdpsldnidirty waterfogmikikmiduckkwdkaxamia palm nutsmdt]upujdnlipure waterjiijkitifoodliirukukuniowlkithendjikatamaninimanduipiajlumaijupuddlethjawomankumaPNThe stress groups are of two basic types — a predominant type, A, having an
unstressed syllable following the stress and functioning as a closure (e.g., each of
the stress groups in idtjkdnd^ki, ‘sea eagle’, thmukdka, ‘floating tree’, mdkathja,
‘fresh water creek’), and a minority type B, having no such final unstressed syllable
(e.g., the final stress groups of dwuriawi, ‘mother of a male child’, jdrdrmju, ‘wedgetailed eagle’, ijhamuhki, ‘I’m full up’). Ninety-seven per cent of the primary stress
groups in the lexicon are of type A and only three per cent of type B. There are
no secondary stress groups of type B. Either type may have one or more unstressed
syllables preceding the stress and functioning as an onset (e.g., kamma, ‘dance
movement’, msjdka, ‘throat’, kuku, ‘yam’), but stress groups with an onset do not
occur word-initially except when the word consists of only one stress group. The
closure of a non-final type A stress group may contain two unstressed syllables
(e.g., ij3ntdJ9-kdjmi, ‘we did it’, pujdka-mu, ‘they sat down’), but a stress group
occurring in word-final position may not have more than one unstressed syllable
in its closure, with the single exception of mwdjliki, ‘swim’, which is the only word
in the language to have two unstressed syllables following primary stress. In longer
words, where there are two or more unstressed syllables between stresses, it is often
impossible to decide to which stress group these belong, but perhaps the decision
is unnecessary in any case, as the stress groups are really wave-like motions and
there is thus little point in trying to find boundaries between them.
The location of primary stress is generally predictable by the rule ‘occurs on
the penultimate syllable of the word’, and, where it occurs elsewhere, its location
can be easily indicated by the use of a stress mark. The location of secondary stress
is a more difficult matter, however, except in words having no more than three
syllables preceding primary stress. In these words the location of secondary stress
can always be predicted as the word-initial syllable is always stressed (except in
words having only one syllable preceding primary stress) and as no two consecutive
syllables may be stressed. These rules allow only the types '(-),
'-^(■""). and
'—e.g., Jluma, ‘basket’, kukuni, ‘water’, dwurmi, ‘man’, miirukupwdm, ‘girl’.
In longer verb forms, containing one or more incorporated items, the secondary
stresses cannot be located without the use of morphological information, as the
general principle is that each stem has a stress on its penultimate syllable. For
example, in li-ni-pa-kapi-w’ammi-amamipa, ‘she came over for some cooked oysters’,
each of the stresses after the word-initial stress is located on the penultimate syllable
of an incorporated stem. To pronounce these long verb forms with the correct
stress pattern, therefore, one has to remember the following rules: (a) primary
stress is on the penultimate syllable of the word (except where otherwise marked);
(b) the first syllable of the word always has the first secondary stress; (c) other
secondary stresses occur on the penultimate .syllable of each incorporated stem.","[36, 37]"

Noun phrase negation is achieved by substituting a negative pronoun karakuwani
‘no one’ or karakamini ‘nothing’ for a particular noun phrase. In this type of negation,
too, verbs have to become subjunctive.
karakuwani jinimatakupauli
No one will come back
no one
he-come back
karakamini jila'ju
(There is) nothing inside
nothing
inside
The Tiwi usually avoid negative pronouns as object. For instance they would not
say ‘I saw no one’ but ‘I looked. No one!’.
1.7.3 Prohibitions
Commands are negated by the insertion of the form pajiti ‘don’t!’ initially in the
imperative sentence, and the negation requires a change of mood in the verb from
imperative to future incompletive. (See Morphology, 1.1.8.)

Sentences may be related to one another by processes of coordination, subordination
and embedding. Coordination is the process for linking sentences in a relation of
mutual non-dependence, and subordination the process for placing one sentence
in a relation of unilateral dependence on another. Embedding is the process for
including one sentence within another, as the functional equivalent of a lower level
structure. The processes are recursive — that is (in principle at least) there is no
limit to the number of times they may apply, although in practice of course the
number of applications is usually very small. The structures which result from the
coordination or subordination of sentences are called complex sentences, and any
sentence which is included in a complex sentence may be referred to as a clause.","[84, 85]"
"Irregular forms
The indirect object prefixes ma-, ‘him’, mara-, ‘her’, and japa-, ‘them’, have irregular
forms in word-initial position and following
‘you’. ‘Him’ is anta- in word-initial
position and ta- following
‘her’ is ija- both in word-initial position and following
tja-; and ‘them’ is apa- both in word-initial position and following i}a-:
ma- -H Ca- -f -kauimi -> anta-ra-kauimi

There are a number of mutually independent morphophonological processes affecting
the form of this morpheme, as explained below.
(a) The initial syllable is deleted in combining with an object prefix:
^3. + ra- -f ma(}i- + ulitja- -b -piuni + -ani -> ya-ra-majj-iitja-pUn-ani
I
p

dur

(b) The final syllable is deleted preceding lib stems and Ca-, and optionally preceding
some stems with initial consonant (Ilb stems and Ca- take initial r following ujlitja-,
and unstressed / becomes a preceding r):
a- -b ulitja- -b -inti -> a-uj(a-rinti
he
dur
stand
He’s standing28
//a- + uiiij3- + -k3jimi -> tju-utd-kduimi
I

(c) Preceding Ila stems (which do not take an initial r) only the final vowel is deleted;
ijd- + Mi/z/a- + -apa
iju-utuj-apa
I
dur
eat
I’m eating.
(d) The stop Q) is optionally prenasalised by the general process for this described
in 1.2;
a- +
he
dur+ -mu
sita-urfjlipa-'/nu
He’s sitting down2.1.9 Ca-, ‘connective-emphatic’
The prefix Ca-, which is used in non-imperative verbs in the construction of
‘walkabout’ forms and in 'imperative verbs as a means of signalling emphasis,
exhibits a rather complex type of consonantal alternation which may be called
lib alternation as it is practically the same as that which characterises the Ilb class
of stems. The initial consonant is p, /, t, r, or /, depending on the morphological
environment, p occurs when the morpheme follows a subject prefix (other than
t}3- in imperative verbs), the tense markers p3-, t3- and ra- (except in subjunctive
verbs), and the ‘morning’ prefix at3- (except in imperative verbs). / occurs when
the niorpheme follows r3- in subjunctive verbs or a-, ‘incompletive’, or at3-,
‘morning’, in imperative verbs, t occurs when the morpheme is in word-initial
position or following ma-, ‘subjunctive’, or a direct object prefix, r occurs following
an indirect object prefix in non-imperative verbs and following
‘durative’.
/ occurs following wa-, ‘you’, in imperative verbs and following indirect object
prefixes in imperative verbs;

Ca- has initial p, /, /, or r, depending on the morphological environment, p occurs
when Ca- follows a subject prefix (except in modally marked verbs), any of the
tense markers pa-, t3- or ra- (except in subjunctive verbs^ the ‘morning’ prefix
at3- or the ‘emphatic’ prefix Ca-. / occurs following ra- in past subjunctive verbs,
following a-, ‘incompletive’, and following a direct object prefix with final dental
nasal, t occurs when the morpheme is in word-initial position, or in subjunctive
verbs following ma-, ‘subjunctive’, or a non-past subject prefix, or follows a direct
object prefix other than mart/-, ‘you sg’, or follows the indirect object prefix mara-,
‘her’, r occurs when the morpheme follows «a- in imperative verbs, or a- in compulsional verbs, or any indirect object prefix except mara-, ‘her’;

2.1.11A:a-,‘evening’
The vowel of ka- is deleted preceding a Ila stem but retained preceding a Ilb stem.

2.2 ua- insertion
Stems with initial consonant may not be immediately preceded in the phonemic
representation by any of the following prefixes: any subject prefix; either of the
tense markers pa-, ‘non-past’, or ta-, ‘past’; na-, ‘locative’, or ata-, ‘morning’. If
any one of these prefixes occurs immediately preceding a stem with initial consonant
in the morphophonological representation, a meaningless segment ua- has to be
inserted between the prefix and the stem:
pa- -f -kauimi -> pa-ua-kauimi
I
do
I do it
pa- + na- + -mapapa -> pa-na-ua-mapapa
I
loc
drink
1 drank (at a distance)
pa- -f- ata- + -majaripi -> pu-ata-ja-majaripi
I
morn lie down
I lie down (in the morning)
Following ji-, ‘you sg p’, ji- ‘he p’, or ji-, ‘she p’, ua- ->
(The vowel is advanced
by the attraction of the vowel in the prefix and j is deleted by a general process for
j deletion between two close front vowels.):
ji- -I- -kauimi -> ji-ua-kauimi
ji-i-kauimi
The ‘evening’ prefix, ka-, which belongs to a very late order and, when it occurs,
is usually the last prefix before the stem, determines ua- insertion in exactly the
same way as a stem with initial consonant. That is, if ka- occurs and is immediately
preceded in the morphophonological representation by any of the morphemes
listed above, ua- has to be inserted preceding ka-:
pa- -I- ka- + -apa -> pa-ua-k-apa
I
eve
eat
I eat in the evening
pa- + na- + ka- -1- -kauimi -> pa-na-ua-ka-kauimi
I
loc
eve
do
I did it in the evening30
When k3- is preceded by C3- a meaningless / is inserted automatically between them
(and this affects the vowel of Ca-):
//a- + ra- + Ca- + ka- + tja- + -apa
ija-ra-pi-i-ki-rj-apa
I
p
cv
eve
hw
eat
I ate on the way (in the evening)
J3- insertion has an effect on the morphology in the following way: (a) Past tense
verbs are formed by the insertion of a past tense prefix ra- or ta-, e.g., ija-ra-pakupauU,
‘I went back’, (b) Wherever ra- is present in the underlying structure immediately
preceding a stem with initial consonant or the prefix ka- it has to be deleted, as the
meaningless ja- is inserted automatically in these environments and there is a general
prohibition of the sequences uau, rar, jar, or rau. Thus, for example, ^a- + ra- +
-kajimi -> r/a-ja-kajimi. {ua- is inserted because of the initial consonant of the
stem, and ra- is deleted because of the initial j of ja-.) There is, however, no reason
to delete ra- if another morpheme is present preceding the stem or ka-, as this either
precludes the insertion of ja- or at least prevents ra- and ua- from being juxtaposed,
e.g., pu-, ‘they’, + ra-, ‘past’, + mani-, ‘me’, + -puni, ‘hit’
pu-ra-mani-puni,
‘they hit me’, (ua- precluded by the presence of the object prefix mani-.) ija-, ‘I’, +
ra-, ‘past’, + ata-, ‘morning’, + -kajimi, ‘do’, -> ija-r-ata-ja-kajimi, ‘I did it in the
morning’, {ja- insertion determined by the initial consonant of -kajimi, ra- not
deleted because, in this case, ata- comes between ra- and ja-.)
To sum up, then, the surface structure of verbs depends to some extent on merely
automatic morphophonological processes of insertion and deletion. If the stem
has an initial vowel it may be immediately preceded in the phonemic representation
by a subject prefix or by any prefix which is not excluded on morphological grounds,
e.g., ya- + -apa -> tju-apa, ‘I eat’ — but, if the stem has an initial consonant,
ja- has to be inserted under the conditions stated above, e.g., pa- + -mapapa
pa-ja-mapapa, ‘I drink’. In forming the past tense of verbs ra- is inserted, e.g.,
pa- + ra- + -apa
pa-ru-apa, ‘I ate’, but where ja- has to be inserted ra- has
to be deleted, unless another prefix comes between them, e.g., pa- + ra- + -mapapa
-> pa-ja-mapapa, ‘I drank’. What this means, in effect, is that verbs from the surface
structure of which ra- has been deleted are ambiguous as regards tense, unless the
subject prefix itself carries a tense meaning.
2.3 Stems
Tiwi verbs have as their nucleus a unit called a theme which may consist simply of
a verb stem or of a verb stem preceded by one or more incorporated stems. (See
Morphology, 1.2 for a description of theme structures.) The morphophonology of
verb stems and of incorporated stems may be described by a single set of state¬
ments as there is no difference between them. Both verb stems and incorporated
stems fall into three classes — I, Ila and Ilb — according to their initial phoneme.
Class I stems are those which have an initial consonant, not only in all their phonemic
representations, but also in their underlying morphophonological representation
(e.g., -kajimi, ‘do’, -puni, ‘hit’). Class Ila stems are those which have an initial vowel
in their morphophonological representation and also in all their phonemic rep¬
resentations, except in certain cases where a w has to be inserted or the initial vowel
deleted (e.g., -apa, ‘eat’, -u'ji, ‘go’). Class lib stems are those which, although they
have an initial vowel in their morphophonological representation, take an initial
consonant (p, t, or r) in most of their occurrences, depending on the morphological
environment (e.g., -akupauli, ‘go back’, -inti, ‘stand’).
Stems may occur in any one of three positions: (a) theme-initial position;
(b) preceded by the prefix mari-', (c) preceded by another stem. In the description
that follows the three positions are treated separately and in the order given. The
morphophonology of stem-suffix combination is treated in section 2.4 following.
2.3.1 Theme-initial position
Stems with initial consonant (Class I stems) undergo no initial change in themeinitial or in any other position but determine ja- insertion under the conditions
described in 2.2:31
T)3I+ miiniija- + -utja
fight^3-J3-munifja-tja

prefix Ca-, and are w combining as explained in 1.1:
fj3- + alipi- -I- -atjkina
iju-alipi-arjkma
I
meat
steal
1 steal the meat
lla stems with initial close vowel lose this vowel following Ca-:
Ca- 4- -utiara -> ta-tiara
imp
tell
Tell him!
(An exception is -u'ui, ‘go’, which combines with Ca- by means of metathesis, e.g.,
Ca- + -u'ji
tu-a'ji, ‘Go!’.) Ila stems with initial a, however, retain this vowel
under all circumstances and combine with a preceding a without any glide, deletion,
or insertion:
Ca- + -apa -> ta-apa
imp
eat
Eat!
Ilb stems in theme-initial position take an initial consonant {p, t, or r) except
when the preceding prefix is Ca-, ‘future-imperative’, or ka-, ‘evening’. The initial
consonant is p except following ma-, ‘subjunctive’, an object prefix,
‘durative’,
tjd-, ‘half way’, or raja-, ‘walking along’:

a- 4- ujitja- 4- apujifja- 4- -'mu
he
dur
talk
sita-unja-rapunjlitja-'mu
He’s sitting talkingWhere an initial consonant is not inserted (i.e., following Ca-, ‘future-imperative’,
or ka-, ‘evening’), the general process of j combination is operative (see 1.1 for a
description of this process):
pa- 4- ka- 4- -inti -> pa-ua-ki-inti
I
eve
stand
I stand in the evening
Ca- 4- -akupauli -> ta-jakupauli
imp
go back
Go back!
An alternative method of combination with the imperative prefix is deletion of
stem-initial vowel (e.g., ta-kupauli, ‘Go back!’) but this method cannot apply to
bisyllabic stems like -inti, ‘stand’.
2.3.2 mari- -f stem
mari- loses its final vowel in combining with a Ila stem but the stem undergoes no
change:
pa- 4- mari- 4- alipi- 4- -mu -> pa-ua-mar-alipi- mu
I

meat
sit
I sat with the meat
paI4-mariwith4-atapa- 4- -u'ui
kwoka
gopa-ja-mar-atapu-'ji
I took the kwoka32
The Ha stem draami-, ‘bundle of spears’, has to combine with mari- by the process
usually reserved for lib stems as there is a general prohibition on the sequence
rar. When mari- precedes a Ilb stem the final syllable of the prefix is deleted and the
stem takes initial j(:
IJ3- + mari- + iliijanta- + -u'.ii

preceded by another stem:
}]3- + malamuniija- + -wja
ijd-ja-ma^amuniija-ija

Ha stems with initial a retain this initial vowel when preceded by another stem,
and the LH stem has its final vowel deleted:
ijd- + ra- + dmdnapi- + -apa -> ija-ra-pumanaij-apa
I
p
get up
eat
I ate before getting up
Ilb stems combine with a preceding incorporated stem in either of two ways, depend¬
ing on the morphophonological class of the latter. One group of incorporated stems
combine with a succeeding Hb stem by the insertion of r:
}]3- + mari- + pani^3- + -amajnipa -> p3-u3-mari-panip3-ramajnipa

Other incorporated stems do not require the insertion of r and in this case the general
process of j combination (for which see 1.1) is applicable:

tj3-ru-utani-amajnipa

I
p
grave post see
1 saw the grave post
The list of incorporated stems which require r insertion amounts to approximately
half the total inventory of these forms, and excludes all forms with final a. Apart
from this, however, a phonological motivation for the distinction is not immediately
apparent as both lists (the list of r forms and the list of non-r forms) consist mainly
of forms which have final a in a neutral environment. The explanation (if indeed
any phonological or morphophonological explanation is to be found) may possibly
be that those instances of morpheme-final a which determine r insertion are derived
historically from u, and those instances which preclude r are derived from i, but,
as no material from earlier periods of the language is available, this explanation
must remain purely hypothetical.
2.4 Suffixes
The verbal suffixes are -amia, ‘reflexive’, -ajliri, ‘reciprocal’, -amiyi, ‘causative’,
-arjimi, ‘collective’, -ami, ‘movement’, -ani, ‘repetition’, and the ‘locative’ suffix
-iia which is restricted to imperative verbs. (See Morphology 1.1 for an account of
the co-occurrence relations of the suffixes.) The enclitics -ana, ‘interrogative’, and
-la, ‘repetition’, may also be suffixed to verbs, as well as to words of most other
classes.
2.4.1 Unstressed final vowel
The general rule for verbal suffixation is that unstressed morpheme-final vowel is
deleted preceding a suffix with initial vowel:33
)j3- + -pimi 4- -amia -> tjd-Jd~pun-amia

ji- + -kdJimi + -ami + -ani -> ji-i-kdjam-am-ani

He kept on doing it
2.4.2 Unstressed final a
The exception to the general rule stated in 2.4.1 is that unstressed stem-final a is
not deleted preceding -ami or -ani. In this environment -ami and -ani take initial w,
and the a of -ani is changed to i, (i.e., -ami
-mami and -ani -> -mini):

2.4.3 -apa 4- suffix
The verb root -apa, ‘eat’ (which may either occur independently as a stem or as
part of the stem -maijapa, ‘drink’), is unique in its method of combining with suffixes
(other than -and). This method is the insertion of k instead of m, and, in this case,
there is no change in the initial vowel of -ani, but the final a of -apa is changed to u:
ga- 4- i- 4- -apa 4- -ami -> tji-i-apu-kami

I

I kept sitting down2.4.5 Stem 4- -ua
Stems combine with the locative suffix -ua, whose occurrence is restricted to im¬
perative verbs, in the following ways;
(a) Unstressed stem-final / is deleted:
Ca- 4- -puni 4- -ua -> ta-pun-ua
imp

Go and hit him!
(b) Unstressed stem-final a is retained and -ua

(c)-pa:ta-kajawala-pa

It also has to be noticed that both human and non-human nouns are used in the
singular when the whole class is referred to rather than specific members of it, e.g.,
murukupwaua pumpuka, ‘Young girls are nice’ (literally ‘young girl nice’), palimajiija
lUUja, ‘Barren women are no good’ (literally ‘barren woman no good’).
The plural suffix is -Wi and this has morphologically conditioned variants -wi
and -pi. There is no general principle for predicting whether any particular stem will
take -wi or -pi, but the -pi plurals are quite few and can easily be listed. - Wi replaces
-Ni and -Ka in the plural forms so that the gender contrast is neutralised in the
plural. Some examples are given below.

Reduplicating plurals have — in addition to the plural suffix - IT/
a plural
prefix Ca-, the initial consonant of which is a reduplication of the initial consonant
of the stem. The formula for such plurals is thus Ca- -f- stern + -Wi. As there are
only nineteen reduplicating plurals in the data these are all listed below. There are
irregularities in the form of many of them but there is no need to specify these
irregularities as the forms are all listed.

NOTES1. Kinship terms are for male Ego and do not occur without personal pronouns.
2. The singular form from which maminiijkuwi, ‘women’, is derived, is extinct.
Similarly, some of the other plurals appear not to be derived from the existing singular
forms, e.g., kmjkdualipi, ‘half siblings’, kakanutjkdluwi, ‘adults’, and papuruluwi,
‘old men’.
3. Ca- is optional in mamuruntawi, ‘white people’, and in kakdtiupkdluwi, ‘adults’.
4. mamanta, ‘friends’, is the only reduplicating plural which does not also have
a suffix. It may be that this represents the older plural pattern in an unmodified
form, mamanta varies freely with a regularised form mantawi.
5. Contrary to appearances, the location of Ca- in auikakulapi and in
jaritjapapdAanJiuwi is not the result of infixation but of prefixation. The nominal
stem ajikula- found in ajikulani is probably a fossilised verb consisting of a subject
prefix a-, ‘he’, the link form ji-, and a verb stem -kula perhaps meaning ‘to be big’.
The location of Ca- in the plural form auikakulapi is the result of prefixation to -kula,
not of infixation in auikula-. Similarly, jdrhjapduanti, ‘good singer’, is probably
a fossilised verb with a stem -pduan^i. Ca- is in this case prefixed to -p3uanj(i.
3PRONOUNS3.1 Personal pronouns
The system of person concepts is based on a two-dimensional scheme, one dimension
being inclusion or exclusion of the speaker and the other inclusion or exclusion
of the hearer. This scheme yields a set of four persons, as follows: first person
(includes speaker but excludes hearer); second person (includes hearer but excludes
speaker); third person (excludes both speaker and hearer); and fourth person (includes
both speaker and hearer). There are two numbers — singular and plural — fourth
person singular being singular in the sense that there is only one speaker and one
hearer, and two genders — masculine and feminine — but entry into this system
is dependent on previous selection of third person and singular number.
The personal pronouns are listed below:

extra-linguistic), mani-, ‘you sg and me’, being related in deep structure to the personal
pronoun mua, mani-, ‘you pi’, to nua, and mani-, ‘us inc’, to ijaya. The i- \nji-i-pimi,
‘He hit him’, is not an object prefix but merely a meaningless segment introduced
by the morphophonology (see Morphophonology, 2.2).
Third-person-singular direct object is inferred from the absence of a prefix, and
gender of such an object (except when it co-occurs with third-person-singular subject
in past tense verbs) is expressed by means of the tense marker p3- or t3-, depending
on the tense of the verb. These two morphemes have multiple function. They always
signal tense but they are also used wherever necessary to signal gender of object
or gender of subject. In transitive verbs with third-person-singular direct object
(other than past tense verbs which also have third-person-singular subject) either
p3- or t3- is inserted to express feminine gender of object. The absence of p3- or
t3- in such a verb indicates masculine object:
f}3m-p3-J3-pimi
^3n-t3-J3-pimi
ij3-j3-puniI’ll hit her
I hit her
I’ll hit him or I hit him40
In past tense verbs, when third-person-singular direct object co-occurs with thirdperson-singular subject, the subject prefixes ji- and ti- are used to express gender
of object, and gender of subject is neutralised. That is, these two prefixes are still
third-person-singular subject prefixes, but the gender meaning which they also
carry is transferred from subject to object:
ji-i-puni
Jli-i-puniHe hit him or She hit him
He hit her or She hit her1.1.5 Indirect object

NOTES1. Verbs meaning ‘give’ (stems -akauai and -ilud) have direct object prefixes as
the translation equivalent of English indirect object, e.g., pu-ra-mawan-takauai,
‘They gave it to us (ex)’, ji-wan-tilua, ‘He gave it to them’.
2. Verbs meaning ‘spear’ have indirect object prefixes as the translation equivalent
of English direct object, e.g., am-pu-rjapa-kapuji, ‘He’s going to spear us (ex)’.
3. The stem -kuja, ‘to die’, takes indirect object prefixes as the translation equivalent
of English subject, e.g., ti-ma-kuua, ‘He died’, p-mara-kuua, ‘She died’, ti-uapa-kuja,
‘They died’.
1.1.6 Tense
There are three tenses — non-past, past and future. Non-past has no time reference
except what is given to it by the context, but is used like the English non-past tense
for the statement of general truths or habitual actions. Tiwi non-past differs from
English non-past, however, in that it is also commonly used with either present
or future time reference, provided the linguistic or extralinguistic context makes
this time reference clear. For example, a-parjulimai may mean ‘he walks’ (regularly
and repeatedly) or ‘he’s walking’ (now) or ‘he’ll walk’ (in the future), and only the
context can make it clear which meaning is intended. The time reference of past41
and future tenses is obvious, but, as there is no perfective aspect in Tiwi, the past
tense forms are used as the translation equivalent not only of English past but also
of English present perfect and past perfect. For example, a past tense form such
as ii-ni-u'ji may be translated ‘she came’ or ‘she has come’ or ‘she had come’, depend¬
ing on the context.
Non-past verbs have one of the non-past set of subject forms listed in 1.1.3, but
are not otherwise marked for tense. Past tense verbs are formed by (a) selecting
one of the past tense set of subject forms, and (b) inserting the past tense marker
ra- wherever the subject form carries no tense meaning. (An exception to this is
that ra- is inserted following pu-, ‘they’, which has a distinctively past tense meaning.)
For example:
non-past
past
I eat
tju-apa

phonology (i.e., preceding a verb theme with initial consonant or the prefix ka-,
‘evening’, — see Morphophonology, 2.2) ra- is not inserted unless another morpheme
is present which would separate ra- and ua-:

locative and past subjunctive verbs, but these are dealt with in the appropriate
sections.
Future tense verbs have non-past subject forms and are marked by the insertion
of Ca-, ‘future’ (see Morphophonology, 2.1 for an account of the morphophonological
variation of this morpheme):
fja-pa-apa
I-fut-eatI’ll eat^a-pa-kajimi

a-ma-ra-kauimi
he-me-fut-do
ija-man-ta-jakauai
I-you-fut-giveI’ll do it
He’ll do it for me
I’ll give it to you42
1.1.7 Aspect
There are five marked aspects, as follows: durative, repetitive, moving, beginning
and inceptive. Durative aspect expresses the continuation of an action through
some period of time or at some point of time. Non-past durative is used for an
action which is actually taking place at the moment of speaking, past durative is
used for an action which was taking place throughout some past period of time
or at some past point of time. There is no future durative form. Repetitive aspect
— which is restricted to past tense — expresses the repetition of an action either
on some particular occasion or over a period of time. That is, it is equivalent to
either ‘kept on’ (doing) or ‘used to’ (do). The use of the moving aspect is dependent
on the previous selection of a durative form. This aspect means that the action is
being performed or was being performed while moving about. The beginning aspect
means that the action spoken of is just beginning and the inceptive aspect that it
is just about to begin. Neither of these last two aspects has a past or a future form.
That is, one can say ‘I’m just beginning to do it’, but not ‘I was just beginning to
do it’ or ‘I shall be just beginning to do it’. Durative, repetitive and moving aspects
can be combined to give durative-repetitive, durative-moving and durative-repetitivemoving forms.
Durative aspect is formed by inserting the durative prefix
fju-ujlif}-apa
I’m eating
I-dur-eat
a-uniiij3-kdjimi
He’s doing it
he-dur-do
ijd-ru-u^iiitj-apa
I was eating
I-p-dur-eat
iu-ur}id-raumi
She was cooking
she-dur-cook
Repetitive aspect is formed by inserting the repetitive suffix -ani:
ji-i-kajdm-ani
He kept on doing it
he-lk-do-rep
u-ui}j(i-k3J3m-am
he-dur-do-repHe kept on doing ittjd-ru-uf}iiij-apu-kani
I-p-dur-eat-repI kept on eatingpu-tu-wuuii-k3J9wala-mini
they-p-dur-sing-repThey kept on singingThe ‘moving’ aspect is formed by inserting the ‘moving’ suffix -ami:
a-uf}Jliy-apu-kami
He’s eating moving about
he-dur-eat-mv
am-p-uiti(i-k3J3wala-mami
he-np-dur-sing-mv
ju-unjli-kajdm-am-ani
he-dur-do-mv-repHe’s singing moving about
He kept on doing it as he moved aboutThe ‘beginning’ aspect is formed by inserting the ‘beginning’ prefix wi-, the
‘future’ prefix Ca- and the ‘moving’ suffix -ami:
yu-wi-Jia-apu-kami
I-bg-fut-eat-mvI’m just starting to eata-wi-ia-k3J3m-ami
he-bg-fut-do-mvHe’s just starting to do ita-wi-Jla-p un-ami
he-bg-fut-hit-mvHe’s starting to hit him43
The inceptive aspect is formed by inserting the inceptive prefix /- and the
‘moving’ suffix -ami:
iji-i-apu-kami
1-iv-eat-mv
a-i-kajdm-ami
he-iv-do-mvI’m just about to eat
He’s just about to do itam-pu-ijani-i-pun-ami
she-np-me-iv-hit-mvShe’s just going to hit me1.1.8 Mood
In addition to the unmarked indicative mood, there are four marked moods. These
are imperative, subjunctive, compulsional and incompletive. The imperative mood is
used for giving commands, and for this only. The subjunctive mood is the mood
for whatever is thought of as merely possible or hypothetical rather than actual,
and has three main obligatory uses: (a) in negative clauses; (b) in non-past or future
interrogative clauses; (c) in the expression of whatever is possible but unlikely —
e.g., ‘If I wanted to I would hit him’. There are past, non-past and future subjunctive
forms. The compulsional mood expresses compulsion, obligation or necessity, and
is equivalent to ‘must’ (do) or ‘have to’ (do). There are both non-past and future
compulsional forms. The incompletive mood is used for whatever is merely attempted
or begun but not completed, and translates ‘try to’ (do) or ‘begin to’ (do). There
are past, non-past and future incompletive forms. The second-person forms of the
future incompletive are also used in prohibitions. The five moods are mutually
exclusive — it is not possible to combine subjunctive and incompletive, for example.
Nor is it possible to combine marked mood with marked aspect. A verb may be
marked either for mood or for aspect, but not for both.
Imperative verbs are marked by the insertion of the future-imperative prefix Ca-.
Singular imperative forms are distinguished from all other verbs by the absence of
a subject prefix. Plural imperative forms have the subject prefix tja-, ‘you’:
ta-apa
Eat! (you sg)
imp-eat
ta-kauimi
Do it! (you sg)
imp-do
ijan-ta-iiara
Tell me! (you sg)
me-imp-tell
rj3-ra-apa
Eat! (you pi)
you-imp-eat
Qa-ra-kauimi
Do it! (you pi)
you-imp-do
(ja-^an-ta-jliara
Tell me! (you pi)
you-me-imp-tell
Non-past subjunctive is formed by inserting the subjunctive prefix ma- and selecting
one of the past tense subject forms:
ojnutjkwa ji-ma-kauimi
He doesn’t do it
not
he-sb-do
j(i-ma-'mu autjwara
Does she sit here?
she-sb-sit here
Future subjunctive is formed in the same way as non-past subjunctive but the
‘future’ prefix Ca- is also inserted:
ojnu^kwa ji-ma-ta-kauimi
He won’t do it
not
he-sb-fut-do
He won’t hit me
amu^kwa ji-ma-ijan-ta-pUni
not
he-sb-me-fut-hit44
pu-ma-ta-wari
they-sb-fut-fightAre they going to fight?","[55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60]"
"56
3.4 Collective pronouns
Collective pronouns, the use of which is demonstrated in the examples below are
formed by inserting a prefix rjati-, ‘all’, in the possessive forms listed in 3.3, after
the class prefix but preceding the pronominal stem:
rjdniyatmwila
ijdnUjatmuwila
rjdnvjatiwutawathe whole lot of us
the whole lot of you
the whole lot of them3.5 Reflexive pronouns
Reflexive pronouns are forrned by adding the reflexive suffix -amia to the emphatic
orms listed m 3.2. Thus ijilawa -> yilawamia, ijintila -> ijintilamia, and so on:
ijdpaumi yilawamia
I’ll cook my own
iiikduimi ijintilamia
Did you make your own?
3.6 Demonstrative pronouns
The demonstrative pronouns express proximity, number and gender, and are as
follows:
Masculine
ijinakiFeminine
aijinaki
d^i'niPlural
kapinaki
kapi'nithis
thatThe ^ of naki- is optioiially prenasalised — e.g., ijinaijki instead of ijinaki—and
kapi- has a variant ijampi-e.g., ijampinaijki instead of kapinaki.
These pronouns may either replace a nominal as subject or object or in any other
syntactic position, or may be used as attribute to a nominal. In either case there
IS agreement of number and gender between pronoun and nominal:
aijinaki pilimuija
This is a road
ijuwitBmaunti ijinaki
I want this one
ta^iara ijVni
Tell that man
Ijinaki pdlaijdmwani pumpuni
This dog is good
aijinaki pslaijdmwaka pumpuka This bitch is good
kapinaki pdlaijdmwawi pumpuwi These dogs are good
There is also a set of demonstratives which are unmarked for proximity —
awara (rnasculine), awutjira (feminine) and awuta (plural). These may be translated
that, that one, those’, ‘those ones’, or ‘he’, ‘she’, ‘they’, according to context,
iheir typical uses are illustrated in the following examples:
awara jiikdjimi, purukupauli
Uafa awara jiikauimi
iipauliyi, awunira pmirjiariijaHe made it, Purukupaili
He made it
It fell down, that tree3.7 Interrogative pronouns
The interrogative pronouns are as follows:
Masculine
Feminine
Plural
kuwani
kuwaija
kuwapi
kamini
kamuija
kamuwi
For example:
kuwani j(iik3J3wala
kamini nampitamamti

What do you want?
Whose is this?who?

"13
/w/ The phonetic norm of the close bnck rounded vowel, /w/, is between close and
half close and somewhat less than fully back — i.e., approximately [(/], e.g.,
jku'kunij, 'water', [ku'kuni]. Slightly closer and more open realisations are in free
variation with this. The rounding is typically realised by a momentary bilabial
glide from a close to a less close type of rounding. Following /p/, /k/, Imj and jijj,
especially, this glide may sound like a semi-vowel, jwj, although it is not interpreted
in this way phonologically, e.g., Ijtu'kutal, ‘whisper’, [jiu'kwuta]; Imi'putil, ‘fish’,
[mi'pwuti].
fal The phonetic norm of the open front unrounded vowel, /a/, is close to the
cardinal position, [a], e.g., Iman'taijaj, ‘woman friend’, [man'daija]; ha'putaj, ‘camp’,
U^'pvld\. The vowel is closer (between open and half open) preceding”y or / and
also following j, e.g., Ita'jintil, ‘stand up!’ [tx'jinti]; /tjampaka'jail, ‘I give it’,
[tjampaka'j^i]; I'jatij, ‘one’, [jaeti]. Between /h’/ and any velar or bilabial consonant
jaj is retracted and rounded so that the juj - joj contrast is neutralised, e.g.,
Iwatfkinij, ‘dog’, [wo^'kini]-, Iwa'mutal, ‘hand’ [wv'muta].
joj The phonetic norm of the open back rounded vowel, /<?/, is close to the cardinal
position, [d], e.g., jam'toijij, ‘jabiru’, [aarfiotji]-, I'nofjaj, ‘other’, ['noija]. The vowel
is somewhat closer following j, e.g., I'jonij, ‘other’, ['jo:ni]. The rounding of the
vowel is typically realised by a momentary glide from a close to a less close type
of rounding, e.g., lan'toraj, ‘male wallaby’, [an'tuvra].
Vowels are nasalised preceding //// if the preceding consonant is jpj, /kl, jm! or
/(;/. e.g., [ji'miijdl, ‘sun’; [ji'mwja], ‘cheek’; [aum'puja], ‘young female wallaby’;
[mara'putja], ‘spear’.
Word-final unstressed /// frequently has no physical realisation following a
bilabial consonant as the bilabial closure is generally not released in this position,
e.g., Iku'tupil, ‘jump’, [ku'tup]-, jpu'aimil, ‘they did it’, [pu'aim/. The psychological
presence of the vowel is made apparent in more formal articulations.
1.3 Unstressed vowels
The vowel phonemes described in 1.1 and 1.2 are established in syllables with
primary word stress. In most unstressed syllables and in syllables with secondary
stress there is a weakening of vowel contrasts (mainly a weakening of the /// - /w/
contrast) brought about by a tendency to centralisation, and this leads to difficulty
in the phonemic identification of vowels in these syllables.
Tiwi words usually have primary stress on the penultimate syllable. This is preceded
by an indefinite number of weak (unstressed and secondarily stressed) syllables,
which together constitute some kind of an onset to the stress nucleus, and followed
by a single unstressed syllable which functions as a closure. Some typical examples
would be ^mtauakauawdla, ‘I sang’, and jaratjkali/jdpa, ‘face’. The problem of vowel
reduction has to be seen within this framework, as absence of primary stress is the
immediate cause of the weakening of vowels.
Even in syllables with primary stress the distinction between /// and /«/ is not
always clear, but, in this position, the tendency to centralisation is generally not
strong enough to bring about a complete neutralisation. Somewhat centralised
vowel sounds do occur in stressed syllables but the phonemic identity of these usually
becomes apparent in a more precise articulation.
In word-final unstressed syllables there is no tendency to centralisation at all.
In this position /w/ and joj are excluded and the system of contrasts is limited to a
distinction between a very clear /// and /a/. The especially close, tense nature of ///
in this position is one of the features which signal the end of the word. In longer
words, consisting of two or more stress groups, the same tense, close realisation of
/// is used to signal the end of each stress group, particularly when stress groups
coincide with incorporated stems, as they often do.
The neutralisation of the /// - /u/ contrast thus does not affect either syllables
with primary stress or word-final unstressed syllables, but is confined to the un¬
stressed or weakly stressed syllables preceding primary stress. If there is only one
such syllable the distinctiveness of the vowel may be retained, but, if there are two14
or more, the front-back contrast tends to disappear (e.g., as in fdpatapuni, ‘owl’,
and praijk3pijluni, ‘crocodile’). As joj rarely occurs in weak syllables the system
of contrasts in these syllables is in practice reduced to a simple binary opposition
between ‘open’ and ‘close’ vowels, a and a, and even this opposition is constantly
threatened by a tendency to centralise the open vowel as well. For example,
jtarika'lanil, ‘turtle’, is sometimes realised as [tardka'lani]. There is thus, in Tiwi
unstressed and weakly stressed syllables, a tendency to dispense with vowel con¬
trasts altogether, although this tendency is usually resisted sufficiently to keep the
open-close contrast operative.
The phonemic identity of the weakened close vowels generally cannot be re¬
covered through morphophonemic processes or by other means. That is, it is
usually not possible to say with any confidence of such a vowel whether it is derived
— either diachronically or synchronically — from an /// or a /w/. It would evidently
be useful for the purpose of phonemic transcription if every one of these weakened
vowels could be traced back to its source, but there is no way of doing this.
In English we are always easily able to recover the phonemic identity of our weak
centralised vowels, both through our knowledge of the traditional spelling forms
(which are a constant reminder of the underlying identity of any particular weakened
vowel), and through our knowledge of the morphophonemic processes which syn¬
chronically relate unstressed vowels to their stressed counterparts (as, for instance,
the unstressed first and third vowels in /fa'tvguafil are traced back to their underlying
values in I'foutdguafl). In Tiwi, however, these means of phonemically identifying
unstressed vowels are not available, as there are no traditional spelling forms to
refer to, and as — Tiwi stress being in a fixed position relative to the word boundary,
regardless of the class of word — vowels which appear in an unstressed position
in one word are almost certain to appear in a similarly unstressed position in any
related words. There is thus little hope of discovering the phonemic identity of
Tiwi weakened close vowels.
The actual phonetic quality of the weakened close vowels varies very considerably,
as there is no contrast at all on the front-back dimension in weak unstressed syllables.
The phonetic norm for the close vowel unit which results from the neutralisation
may be considered to be [a], as this is about the centre of the area of variation, but
actual realisations vary all the way from [j] to [u], the variation being partly free
and partly conditioned. There is a strong tendency for the vowel to be retracted
and rounded between a labial and a velar consonant — e.g., in environments such
as /p-kl and Ip-ijj — and for it to be advanced to a close front position following
/// or preceding /a/, but, in other environments, the quality of the vowel varies
freely from [/] to [v]. The following verb forms, which all contain the incorporated
stem meaning ‘egg’ (roughly dtjandtjd-), will give some indication of the nature of
the difficulty. ijdAama^iijanBiju'Ai, ‘I took the eggs’; awdniiij9matdij9niijd'mu, 'Ut's
sitting with some eggs’; jimdntiijaniijapu^ita'puni, ‘He hit me on the ear with an
egg’; ijantapuijdnirjiatjkdld'wini, ‘I saw the eggs’. As the examples show, the vowels
of the stem meaning ‘egg’ are all close but they vary so considerably on the frontback and rounded-unrounded dimensions that no phonemic identification is possible.
In this situation, the spelling of the weakened close vowels is a problem of some
difficulty, to which there is no entirely satisfactory solution. Briefly, since a phonemic
identification of these vowels is impossible for the reasons given above, there are
just two ways of approaching the problem of spelling them. These are: (a) to represent
every weakened close vowel as a, regardless of its actual phonetic quality; (b) to
attempt a phonetically impressionistic rendering of them using a variety of phonetic
symbols, (a) has the advantage of being phonological (since a is the symbol which
identifies the close vowel unit which results from the neutralisation of the /// - /w/
contrast), but the disadvantage of being too conventional for reading purposes,
as vowels which are retracted or advanced by the environment to [c/] or [i] cannot
very happily be transcribed as a. For this reason solution (a) has to be abandoned
and (b) preferred, although this leads to constant uncertainty in the spelling forms
because of the free variation referred to above.","[28, 29, 30]"

3 NOMINAL MORPHOPHONOLOGY
The description of nominal morphophonology consists of just two sections —
3.1, Prefixes, and 3.2, Suffixes. Both of these sections are very brief owing to the
simplicity of the nominal morphology.
3.1 Prefixes
The only riominal prefix is the plural prefix Ca-, the initial consonant of which
is a reduplication of the initial consonant of the stem;
Ca- + kuijli- + -Wi
ka-kui^u-wi
pi
small
pi
children
Ca- + murukupwaua + -Wi -> ma-murukupwau-uwi
pi
girl
pi
girls
There are certain irregularities in the combination of Ca- with stems with initial
vowel, but, as all the irregular forms are listed in Morphology 2.2.2, there is no
need to describe them here.
3.2 Suffixes
Each of the three nominal suffixes-Ni, ‘masculine’, -Ka, ‘feminine’, and -Wi,
‘plural’ — has two morphologically conditioned variants, the variants in each case
having different but homorganic consonants. The variants of -Ni are -ni and -ti,
the variants of -Ka are -ya and -ka, and the variants of - Wi are -wi and -pi\
Masc
Fern
Plural
‘human’
tini
titja
tiwi
‘good’
pupuni
pupuka
pupuwi
‘child’
mwauti
mwauitja
mwojuwi
‘greedy’
puijkauini
puijkdjika
puijkdjipi
The variation is conditioned morphologically, there being no general phonological
or semantic factors which could account for it. Although -ni, -pa and -wi form a
set, and -ti, -ka and -pi another set, there is no guarantee — as the above examples
show
that any given nominal stem will take all three suflfix forms from the same
set. As -ni, -pa and -wi are much more common than -ti, -ka and -pi, the easiest
method of generating correct nominal forms is to memorise all the nominal stems
which take any member of the latter set. All other stems can then be assumed to
take -ni, -pa and -wi. The probable historical explanation of the present facts is
that -«/, -pa and -wi are a relatively new development and have gradually been re¬
placing the older set of forms. Currently, -ti, -ka and -pi have ceased to be productive.
Except in monosyllabic stems, stem-final i is changed to u preceding w or between
labial and velar consonants (as explained in 1.1):
Masc
Fern
Plural
‘black’
tuniwini
tuniwupa
tuniwuwi
‘wallaby’
aumpini
aumpupa
aumpuwi
Recutting of nominal structures — perhaps only in relatively recent times —
has led to the appearance of new forms of -ni, -pa and -wi having an initial vowel.
Historically, the correct analysis of forms such as tuniwini, tuniwupa, tuniwuwi is
tuniwi-ni, tuniwu-pa, tuniwu-wi, but present-day speakers of the language have re¬
located the morpheme boundary in at least some forms of this kind and reinterpreted
them as, e.g., tuniw-ini, tuniw-upa, tuniw-uwi. That is, the suffixes are now felt to
be -ini, -ipa and -uwi, although, historically, the initial vowel does not belong to
them but has been acquired from the stem. The evidence of the recutting is that,
whenever a new nominal stem-f suffix structure is to be generated, this is done by
deleting the stem-final vowel and adding -ini, -ipa or -uwi. For example, the newly
formed feminine equivalent of alawuua, ‘boss’, is alawuuipa, not *alawujapa as it
would have been if it had been formed in the same way as the old-established
feminines, and the newly formed plural of pwajla, ‘shell’, is pwa^uwi, not *pwaj[awi.","[49, 50]"

3.3 Relator-axis phrases
A relator-axis phrase consists of a Relator (manifested by a preposition) and an
Axis (manifested by a nominal or nominal phrase), in that order.
kayi makatifja
at the creek
kapi tiijata
to the beach
ka upuija
in the grass
There are just two prepositions — kayi (variant form kd) and kapi (variant form
ijampi), and both of these have an entirely general locative/directional meaning,
the translation equivalents of both being ‘at’, ‘to’, ‘in’, ‘on’, ‘by’, etc. In order to
express a more specific locative or directional meaning, it is necessary to use a
locative adverb such as jila'ju ‘inside’ or kdji'u ‘above’, e.g. jipaputi kdui'u kapi
jutjwjkwa ‘He went up above, to the sky’.","[91, 92]"

however, as there are always alternative means of expressing the same concepts
outside the verb. A minimal verb theme — i.e., one into which nothing has been
incorporated — consists simply of a verb stem. Either one or two forms, typically
functioning as adjunct and object, may be incorporated into this structure, preceding
the stem. If two are incorporated adjunct precedes object — i.e., the maximum
structure is adjunct + object + verb stem:
ji-mon-taijkina
he-me-stealHe stole it from meJi-rmn-alipi-aijkina
he-me-meat-stealHe stole my meatji-m3ni-tjilimpatj3-raijkina
he-me-sleeping-stealHe stole it from me while I was asleepji-m3ni-ijilimpa^-alipi-atjkma
he-me-sleeping-meat-stealHe stole my meat while I was asleepThe incorporation as object of forms referring to parts of the body is restricted
to very few verbs — notably -ni, ‘hit’, -tja, ‘grab’, and -kuwirarji, ‘burn’:
ji-m3ni-rja
he-me-grabHe grabbed meji-m3ni-k3Ji-ija
he-me-hand-grabHe grabbed me by the handji-m3ni-marikuatj3pi-^a
he-me-dancing-grabHe grabbed me while I was dancingji-m3ni-marikuai]3p3-k3ji-ija
he-me-dancing-hand-grabHe grabbed me by the hand while I was dancingIntransitive verbs naturally can have no object, incorporated or otherwise, but a
few very common intransitive stems — notably -u'ui, ‘go’, - mu, ‘sit’, and -amaunipa,
‘get up’ — allow the incorporation as adjunct not only of all the verb-like forms
listed below but also of the noun-like forms, provided these are preceded by man-,
‘with’, and such incorporated structures are generally the translation equivalent
of English object:
ju-u'ji
he-goHe wentji-i-mar-u'ui
he-lk-with-goHe took itji-i-mari-tjiliwariiu^-u'ji
he-lk-with-wallaby-go

she-loc-lk-with-get upShe got up and brought itii-n3-ui-mari-kiaw3l3ij3-ramajnipa
she-loc-lk-with-crab-get upShe got up and came with some crabs1.2.2 Incorporated forms
The incorporated forms are divided into three groups — first the forms with verb¬
like meaning, which typically function as some kind of adjunct; secondly the forms
with noun-like meaning, which typically function as object but which can also
function as adjunct (in the few verbs specified above) if mari- is prefixed to them;
and thirdly, the forms referring to parts of the body, which can only function as
object and only in the few verbs mentioned.","[62, 63]"
"How did he do it?
Why have you come?
NOTES1. In questions about the identity of a person represented by a personal pronoun,
this pronoun, not the interrogative, functions as subject, e.g. yipla kuwani?
‘Who (are) you?’ (literally ‘you who?’), not * kuwani ijinta?
2. kamini translates ‘what’ only in the sense ‘what thing’, e.g. kamini jipakauai?
‘What did he give him?’ ‘What’ in the sense ‘in what manner’ is translated
au^ana, e.g. auyana tiimi? ‘What did you do?’ Note that ‘What’s your name?’
is pip^a awjana jintapa? (literally ‘you how name’).
3. ‘Why?’ in isolation is translated not just kama? but pili kama? (‘for what?’).
kama? does occur by itself, but then tends to mean something like ‘Well then,
what about it?’.
1.7 Negation
There are two types of negation — predicate phrase negation (i.e. the negation of
the predicate phrase as a whole) and noun phrase negation.
1.7.1 Predicate phrase negation
The negation of the predicate phrase is usually achieved by the insertion of a negative
adverb ka/lu or aunuijkwa at the beginning of the phrase.

number and gender, and are both human and animate), and let us suppose that
phonological signals of structure are also absent (as they might be). Disambiguation
is still achieved through knowledge of the cultural context, as all Tiwi are familiar
with the story of Purukupajli and Japara, and thus know in advance who hit who
in the eye.
1.4 Expansion
The sentence may be expanded by the insertion of optional elements whose function
is to place the action referred to in its spatio-temporal context, and to add information
about the persons and things involved in it in a peripheral way. These elements are
T1 (Temporal), L (Locative), Ma (Manner), In (Instrument) and B (Benefactive).
Tl, whose function is to indicate the time at which the action took place, is mani¬
fested by time adverbs such as lapinaui ‘in the morning’, av.’ulanaui ‘in the afternoon’,
parjari ‘tomorrow’. L, whose function is to indicate the place at which the action
took place, is manifested by place names such as marakawijatja and wuhaij'ku,
common nouns such as wauta ‘bush’, tiijata ‘beach’, and relator-axis phrases like
ka uputja ‘in the grass’. Ma, whose function is to indicate the manner in which the
action was performed, is manifested by a small number of manner adverbs such as
mamana ‘softly’, and the adjectives pumpuni ‘good’ and tUti ‘bad’ and their synonyms.
In, whose function is to indicate the thing (if any) with which the action was performed,
is manifested by nouns and noun phrases of appropriate meaning such as taijini
‘stick’, wauapa ‘stone’. B, whose function is to indicate the person for whom the
action was performed, is manifested by personal names, common animate nouns
and relator-axis phrases.

"19
The facts which suggest that the Tiwi interpret all their vowel sequences as
bisyllabic — regardless of how they actually sound in phonetic terms — are as
follows: (a) The Tiwi vowel sequences are historically different from their apparent
counterparts in English. English ai, au, a:, etc., are each historically one phoneme
(derived from Old English i:, u:, a:), but the Tiwi sequences are historically —
as well as currently — two phonemes. English speakers always have regarded —
and still do regard — ai, for example, as one phoneme, and therefore one syllable
nucleus, but Tiwi speakers certainly regard the ai in their language as two phonemes,
(b) The monosyllabic appearance of the vowel sequences, although it is usual in
ordinary, rapid speech, tends to disappear in a more careful articulation. For
example, the VV sequences in amat/kini, ‘new’, taiku'wapi, ‘many’ and ta'apa,
‘Eat!’ normally sound like single syllables in rapid speech, but, in a more careful
type of articulation, it is easy to hear the informant actually separating the two
vowels in each sequence and making each a separate syllable nucleus, (c) The diph¬
thongs always function as two syllables in the word stress pattern. In the normal
pattern stress comes on the penultimate syllable, and word-final diphthongs will
only fit into this pattern if they are understood as two syllables. For example,
jarakd'pai, ‘crocodile’, and ndtnaijd'rau, ‘red ochre’, only conform to the norrnal
stress pattern if ai and au are bisyllabic. (d) When a monosyllabic suffix or enclitic
is added to a word, the stress has to be shifted one syllable to the right in order
to remain in penultimate position. When this is done to a word which ends in a
diphthong the stress shifts to the second element of the diphthong. For example,
'joi, ‘dance’, + -la, ‘repeatedly’, is jo'ila, ‘dance repeatedly’, niki'nau, ‘you will
throw fire’, -t- -la, ‘repeatedly, is nikina'ula, ‘you will throw fire repeatedly’, and
pu'nai, ‘husband’, -f -tja, ‘feminine’, is puna'itja, ‘wife’. As there can be no doubt
that jo'ila, -na'ula, -rufii^a, etc., are each three syllables, the bisyllabic nature of
any diphthong can be made plain by shifting it to an environment where stress
comes on the second element.
2. Syllabic consonants
Another problem is that concerning the use of consonants as syllable nuclei. The
four nasals and the trill r are used in this way when they fill the place of an un¬
stressed vowel which has been weakened to the point of disappearance. For example,
ij'kana is a realisation of jitj'kana, ‘tooth’, and 'ijia r'rjani is a realisation of 'yia
ri'yani, ‘my father’. This information is not included in the description of syllables
given above because that description is primarily concerned with phonological
facts not phonetic facts. On the phonological level (i.e., in the speaker’s mind) the
vowels are ‘really’ there, no matter how the forms come out in terms of phonic
substance, and the description has to be primarily concerned with mental facts of
this kind.
3. Initial consonant clusters
A problem in the description of the syllable margins is the phonological interpre¬
tation of the lip rounding which is represented by [w] in the sequences [pw], [^w],
[mw], [/;w]. There are three possible ways of interpreting this feature: (a) as the
labialisation in a labialised series of consonants Ip'^j, Ik'""!, Infl, lu'*'!', (b) as the
rounding of the immediately following vowel; (c) as a separate phoneme segment,M.
The evidence for (a) is as follows: (i) the labialisation is simultaneous with the
consonant articulation phonetically, i.e., the lips are rounded before the release
of the consonant; (ii) the feminine forms of nominals such as juru'kuni, ‘long’ and
ajlu'kuni, ‘digging stick’, which have lip rounding present in the penultimate syllable,
are not *ju'ruka, *a/luka, etc., as one would expect, but ju'rukwa and a/lukwa.
As the process involved in the derivation of feminine forms of this kind requires the
retention of stem-final k and the addition of a, it is hard to explain the lip rounding
in the final syllable except on the hypothesis that it has been retained with the k,
i.e., that it belongs to the k and is part of it.","[34, 35]"
"Part TwoMYTHSINTRODUCTION
Myths are primitive man’s source of authority for his institutions. He normally
seeks to justify his laws and customs not on the grounds of their utility or rationality
but solely on the grounds of their derivation from the gods and ancestors of the
remote past. The permanence of his institutions is all that stands between him and
chaos and he feels compelled to find some supernatural or semi-supernatural
authority for them. Thus the Tiwi answer to questions about the reasons for their
customs is always ‘Purukupaali made it’ or ‘Maaimpunini made it’.
Tiwi myths are thus mainly an explanation of the origin of things, and the source
of authority for them. Purukupaali made the funeral ceremonies and taboos con¬
nected with death, Maaimpunini and Tokwampini made the totemic groups and
laws governing marriage, and Purikikini and X^putupuni made the initiation system
and the ceremonies connected with it. Other mythological figures were the
discoverers of fire, hunting, bark canoes, and similar things of importance to the
Tiwi.
The main story — that of Purukupaali and Japara. — tells how death first came
into the world, through the frailty of the woman Waijai. According to this story,
long ago, when all the animals lived on earth as human beings, there was no
death in the world. The first death was that of Purukupaali’s baby son Tifiani,
brought about through the sin of his wife, Waijai. After that, Purukupaali made
the harsh law of death for all. Japara (the moon), who the Tiwi believe to have
the power of regeneration, offered life for Tifiani, and for us all, but Purukupaali
would not agree. ‘He was a hard man,’ the Tiwi always say. A strong sense of the
transience of human existence is at the centre of Tiwi spiritual experience, and this
is summed up in Purukupaali’s words ""'ijawalajampunammi t]ia majani, taikuwapi
pajlutjwam, karakuwani jinimatakupaulC, (‘We shall all have to follow my son.
Everyone will die. No one will ever come back.’)
The poignancy and pathos of the Purukupaali story, however, is not the
characteristic mood of the texts, for the Tiwi are a cheerful people and always ready
to find humour in the situations they are describing. The funny side of things is
always ready to come uppermost in their minds — as in the story of Kuaipurani
and IJaaiqa, for example, and in that of Aantogi, the jabiru, who made the sea salt
with her urine.
What the reader will inevitably fail to appreciate unfortunately, unless he takes
the trouble to obtain copies of the tapes and listen to them in conjunction with the
transcriptions, is the poetry of the Tiwi language. The best example in the collection
is Text 1, the story of Purukupaali and Japara, as told by Foxy Jipanwuti, but
almost any text chosen at random affords ample evidence of the power and diversity
of the language. The translations generally convey little of the effect of the original,
as the semantic complexity of the verb forms is lost in an English paraphrase.
Simple phrases, too, like waijai jimpajliffa purukupauli ijara punajitja, (Waijai the
woman, Purukupaali’s wife), and waija jimukuua ijara mauani kiijini, (His little son
was already dead), have an emotional power derived from familiarity which the
translations regrettably fail to convey. For the reader who wishes to be able to
respond to effects of this kind, merely reading the transcriptions is not enough.
He has to listen to the tapes as well, until the rhythms and cadences of the language
have pervaded his mind.
The power of myths is founded in their antiquity, in their transmission from
generation to generation, from our grandfathers and great-grandfathers and from
their grandfathers and great-grandfathers before them, from the dawn of time down
to us who are living today. They are an expression of the continuity of life and of80
our bond with the dear, familiar world we were born in, and constitute an affirmation
of our identity as a people. The old Tiwi, who told these stories, were proud men
with a strong sense of their ancient tradition. They respected the white man’s culture
but knew it was not for them. They knew they never could or would turn into black
Europeans. What they felt is best expressed in Allie Miller’s words in his account
of the origin of the kujlama ceremony: mia'tu nua muruntawi tjsninuwila
paulini . . . tjawa'tu tuniwuwi — ijawa tiwi, pawa tiwi — ijawa ka/lu
ijdinatamwaji pdiiiijawila . . . ijawa ka/lu tj^matamwaji pili ijawa kaj'lu
murmtawamaji. ijawa ijinta tiwi, ijawa tuniwuwi. ‘You white people have your
own ancient tradition, and we black people — we Tiwi, we Tiwi — will never give
up our own. We will never give it up because we are not white people. We are Tiwi.
We are black people.’
The Informants
The informants were as follows; texts 1 and 14, Foxy Jipanwuti (qawuntipatamiri);
texts 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 16 and 17, Allie Miller (wuraputuwai); texts 4 and
5, Harry Carpenter (mi^amijau); text 13, Laurie Nelson (tukuliapanila); text 15,
King Larrie (takampuga). At the time when the recordings were made (1967), Allie
Miller and Laurie Nelson were in their fifties. Foxy Xipanwuti over sixty, and
Harry Carpenter and King Larrie both over seventy. Foxy Xipanwuti was the only
Bathurst Islander among them, the rest being from Melville Island. Allie Miller
and Laurie Nelson were brothers, and both died in 1968. Their elder brother. King
Larrie, died in 1971.","[92, 93, 94, 95, 96]"
"1.1.2 Vowel system
The Tiwi vowel system, in common with that of a small number of other north
Australian languages, differs from the basic triangle generally found in Australia
by the possession of a fourth vowel, joj. The system is thus a quadrilateral based on
two dimensions of contrast and having the following vowel phonemes: a close
front unrounded vowel, ///; a close back rounded vowel, /«/; an open front un¬
rounded vowel, lal; and an open back rounded vowel, /o/.
iua0The four vowels are shown in stressed position in the following examples:
I'ti^aj, ‘woman’, I'tu^aj, ‘basket’, I'tatjal, ‘Grab it!’ laun'torjil, ‘jabiru’.
NOTES1. The a-o distinction
The distinction between /a/ and jo! is neutralised following /w/. The word for
‘crow’, for example, could equally well be written as jwakwa'kinil or /wokwo'kirtil.
The functional load of joj is very low. It does not occur in word-initial or wordfinal positions, and even word-medially its incidence is very low. This makes it
difficult to find good examples to demonstrate the laj — joj contrast, but, never¬
theless, the contrast is not in doubt as the two sounds do occur in exactly the same
phonological environments, and, where they occur, one is not freely substitutable
for the other, e.g., Iji'latil, ‘knife’, Iji'lotil, ‘for ever’; !iaru'mwaka!, ‘road’, /ar^'jioral,
‘male wallaby’.
2. Vowel length
Differences of vowel length are not phonemic in Tiwi. The absolute length of stressed
vowels varies considerably but this variation is of no linguistic relevance. Sequences
of two identical vowel phonemes (as in jta'apaj, ‘Eat!’ and jkii'iinil, ‘little boy’,)
are sometimes realised phonetically as a single long vowel, but these sequences
are really interpreted as two syllables.
3. Diphthongs
Although a number of diphthongs occur phonetically these are all interpreted
phonologically as two phonemes. There are no diphthong phonemes like English
Jail. (See section 2, note 1 for a discussion of this subject.)12
1.2 Realisation of the phonemes
1.2.1 Consonants
The stops — IpI, Itj, jtl and /^7 — are bilabial, apico-dental, apico-alveolar and
dorso-velar respectively. The four nasals — //??/, //?/, //?/ and /y/ — have corresponding
places of articulation. The lateral, ///, is apico-alveolar; jrj is an apico-alveolar flap,
/y/a voiced dorso-velar fricative, and l.il a retroflex vocoid. The two semi-vowels,
Ijl and /w/, are palatal and velar glides. All the more important variation in the
realisation of the consonants is dealt with in the following paragraphs.
(a) Aspiration and voicing of stops
The stops may be either voiced or voiceless, aspirated or unaspirated, fortis or
lenis, and the variation is free in most phonological environments. Voicing is mainly
restricted to /t/ following a nasal (e.g., [man'dani], ‘friend’, [muwn'dani], ‘white man’)
the other stops seldom being fully voiced. Typical realisations are voiceless or only
slightly voiced, unaspirated, and lenis, but these realisations vary freely in all
phonological environments with aspirated, fortis, wholly voiceless realisations.
There is no tendency to voice stops intervocalically or (except for ///) following
a nasal.
(b) Lamino-palatal allophones of the dental consonants
The basic realisation of the dental consonants /// and //;/ is apico-dental, the tip
of the tongue being placed on the back of the upper front teeth, e.g. Itmjka'nmjkij,
‘white-breasted sea eagle’, [wjka'naijki], Ina'tiijaj, ‘one’, [na'tuja]. Preceding the
close front vowel ///, however, the front of the tongue is raised and advanced in
anticipation of the vowel, resulting in palatalised realisations which may be rep¬
resented here as [tj] and [«/], e.g. Itui'pinil, ‘red-backed sea eagle’, [tjui'ijini],
Ini'rjanil, ‘spirit’, [nji'pani]. The distribution of the two allophones overlaps to some
extent, as [(] does sometimes occur preceding a close front vowel and [tj] does some¬
times occur preceding a close back vowel, e.g. jtu'apal, ‘she ate’, may be [tu'apa]
or [ryu'apa], but [r] has the less restricted occurrence and is clearly the basic allophone.
(c) Retroflexion of alveolar consonants
The apico-alveolar consonants, jtl, jn! and ///, are retroflexed following the retroflex
vocoid /a/, e.g., ['wauta], ‘bush’, [a/riapa], ‘Wait!’ [aj'lukwa], ‘fighting stick’. In other
phonological environments also the realisation of these phonemes may be slightly
retroflexed as, although the tongue tip is typically on the alveolar ridge, it may
be slightly above it.
(d) Labialisation of consonants
All consonants are labialised preceding a rounded vowel, e.g., jan'joral, ‘male
wallaby’, phonetically [an' f^ara].
(e) Variation in the realisation of r
jrj is usually an apico-alveolar flap [/•] — e.g., IJarama'jul, ‘eagle’, phonetically
[Jarama'ju] — but trills also occur sometimes especially when the phoneme has
syllabic function, e.g., ['rjia fijani], a realisation of I'rjia ri'tjanil, ‘my father’.
There is no other important variation in the realisation of the consonants.
1.2.2 Vowels
/// The phonetic norm of the close front unrounded vowel, ///, in syllables with
primary word stress, is a lax vowel between close and half close and considerably
retracted — i.e., [/], e.g., Imim'pinil, ‘louse’, [mim'pini]. This quality varies freely
with a somewhat less retracted sound, [/]. In word-final stressed syllables the quality
is close to [/] but the length is much greater, e.g., [panampi'ti:], ‘mother of a female
child’. The vowel is closer and further front (near to the cardinal position) both
preceding and following J and in unstressed word-final or stem-final position, e.g.,
[ijiJimaijapukami], ‘I’m just going to have a drink’. The realisation of /// in non¬
final unstressed syllables is explained in 1.3, which is a discussion of the neutralisation
of the /// - /«/ contrast in these syllables.","[27, 28]"
"3WORD SI RIXS |•A^^^;RN.S'I'iwi word stress is normally fixed on (he penultimate .syllable, rcgardlc.ss of the
class of the word or its morphological structure, (c.g., 'wi/ja, ’.sea’, 'kapi, ‘at’, ti'tjata,
‘beach’, nymara, ‘talk’, tuni'wlni, ‘black’, /j.ij,}nuip'rii>i, ‘I lay down’). If the stem
is in word-final position stress comes on the penultimate syllabic of (his, but, if
suHixcs arc added, stress is shiftcti to the right so as to keep it on the penultimate
syllabic (d the woril (c.g., Jiikyjinii, ‘he ilid it’, Jlik.uyniani, ‘he kept on doing it’,
jiik.UiVnynumi, ‘he kept on moving about and doing i(’). In this way strc.ss functions
as a means of locating word bouiularics in the stream of speech, as it is usually
sale to assume that there is a word boundary after (he syllabic following the stress.
It also means, of course, that there is normally no means of distinguishing
phoncmically identical worils by a ilill'erence in (he location of stress. I'hcrc arc,
in fact, a number of stems which have stress on the fund syllable, but these only
amount to about three per cent of the total number of stems in (he lexicon and
include a number of loan words fiY)m .liwadja (a language of the adjacent mainland).",[36]
"Explanatory Notes
1 The pandanus palm was used as a kind of umbrella, to provide shade.
2 The Tiwi use a flexible stick to climb trees. This is passed round the trunk and
takes the weight of the body in climbing up.
3 That is, if there were two honey nests, the man would cut down the branch.
4 rrr, rrr, rrr represents the sound of the man sliding down the tree.
5 The Tiwi distinguish several different types of honey, some of which are classified
as masculine and some as feminine. The types mentioned in the text are taliijini
(masculine), jimpaua (feminine), maijuna (masculine), and lipiitjkinii (feminine).
According to the informant, jimpaja is the wife of taliijini and Jipiirjkimi is the
wife of maijuna.

When an old man is sick, he counts the days.! After three, four, five, six days, he
says to his wife, ‘Hey! You must go. Everyone will have to come. Everyone will
have to come.’2 ‘What for?’ ‘I’m going. I’m dying.’ The others go and tell them.
Everyone comes to his camp. ‘What, then?’ they ask. ‘You are welcome. I’m going.
I’m dying. I shan’t come back. I’m dying now. It’s for ever.’
Then, ‘Wife,’ he says — ‘Yes,’ she says — ‘Give me some water.’ ‘What for?’
‘I’m going now. I’m dying.’3 ‘Oh.’ ‘But first I shall ask you, when I am dead, who
do you want to have you? How about so and so?’** ‘All right.’ ‘Well then, nephew,’
he says. ‘Yes,’ he answers. ‘Well then, brother-in-law, how about your sister?’ ‘Yes,’
he answers too.5 Then, ‘Well, give me some water, because I’m going now.’ She
gives him water and they all start crying. He is dead for ever. They wrap him in
stringy bark, take him away, and bury him.
‘You people here are not pukamani. These others are pukamani.'^ One month
goes past and then they dance.^ They make the grave posts.8 Five men go to make
them. No woman can come there. No, it’s much too sacred. There would be a lot
of trouble. Then they finish.^Ill
Explanatory Notes
1 He counts the days he is sick. If he does not get better after five or six days he
believes he will die.
2 The Tiwi think it proper for a big crowd of relations to be present when a man
dies. Privacy is something almost unknown to them. Every important action in
their life has to be conducted in public. The old man wants all his relations to
to be present, first as a sign of his own importance, and secondly, to try and
influpce their actions after his death by binding them with promises. The male
relations want to be present at the death bed in order to demonstrate that the
old man’s authority, and control over his women, has passed to them. Everyone
jockeys for position and no one feels any real grief, although grief is simulated.
3 The Tiwi believe that a dying man’s life will depart through his mouth if he opens
it wide to eat or drink. The old man asks for water as he does not wish to protract
his dying indefinitely, but wants to get it over quickly and easily.
4 The main preoccupation of a Tiwi man’s life is to gain control over women.
Even when he is dying, he still tries to influence the remarriage of his widows.
The widows may be young and attractive, as Tiwi wives may easily be fifty or
sixty years younger than their husbands, and, in any case, all are expected to
remarry.
5 The old man asks his nephew-in-law and brother-in-law to see that his wishes
about his wife’s remarriage are carried out. -piniwini (translated ‘nephew’ in the
text) is the man with whom one exchanges sisters’ daughters. He is thus both
one’s sister’s daughter’s husband and one’s wife’s mother’s brother, -nimini is
the man with whom one exchanges younger sisters, and hence both one’s sister’s
husband and one’s wife’s brother.
6 pukamani is the state of being of the close relations of a deceased person. In this
state they are not allowed to touch food or take part in the preparations for the
funeral ceremony. It is necessary to establish at once who is pukamani and who
is not, as only the people who are not pukamani can make the posts and other
objects needed for the grave, and organise the funeral ceremony.
1 A Tiwi funeral ceremony consists of a series of dances held over a period of several
months, the first dance being held in the month following the death.
8 The grave posts are carved, painted posts, anything from five to fifteen feet high,
which are stood in the ground round the grave.
^ The ceremony is finished when the final dance (called jiloti) has been held. This
is not until several months after the death.","[125, 126, 127]"

1. -amia, ‘reflexive’, -atiri, ‘reciprocal’, -animi, ‘collective’, -amiyi, ‘causative’.
2. -ami, ‘movement’.

There is also a suffix -ua, ‘locative’, but, as the occurrence of this morpheme is
restricted to imperative verbs, it cannot be assigned to an order.
1.1.3 Subject
Person, number and gender of subject are expressed by means of the subject prefixes
or (as some of the subject prefixes are homophonous) by means of a subject prefix
plus a tense marker pa-, or ta-. The expression of subject is generally inseparable
from the expression of tense as, in most cases, the two are done by the same mor¬
phemes or morpheme sequences. Third-person-singular direct object also has its
expression in the ‘subject’ forms, as explained below.
The subject forms in non-imperative verbs (except for transitive verbs with thirdperson-singular direct object) are as follows:

Textual Note
1 The informant broke off at this point and apologised for using an English word.
Translation
When his son, XiQani, was dead, he called outi ‘Go, all of you! You must go and
make grave posts. Go and make grave posts!2 First there will be a preliminary
dance,’3 (that’s when they clap.** It’s a little dance) ‘then, when you have finished
— when you have finished, when you have cleared the ground,^ come and tell me.’
Then,<5 ‘We’re going, as there’s a big dance now!^ A dance. A big one. A dance.’
Then they danced. She too the woman Pamatikimi.8 She too Pamatikimi the woman.
Then she sat down. Then the other woman — the other woman.9 But first the
bereaved Purukupaali stretched out his arms,io for he was a big man.n He
was not young. He was a big man. First he sat down, then he danced. The woman
Pamatikimi danced as well. Our mothers were big. Waijai as well, Waijai danced.
They were Purukupaali’s wives.
Explanatory Notes
1 Both pronouns refer to Purukupaili. The death of Xio^ni occurs in the story of
Purukupajli and X^para (Text 1). Text 6, like Text 5, is an account of the original
funeral ceremony — that held by Purukupajli for his dead son.
2 The grave posts are carved painted posts, anything from five to fifteen feet high,
and anything up to fifteen in number, which are stood in the ground around the
grave. The only reason the Tiwi can give for making the posts is that Purukupajli
commanded it.
3 A Tiwi funeral ceremony consists of a series of dances held at intervals over a
period of several months. There are first a number of small preliminary dances
(called jilaniya), and then the whole series culminates in a big final dance (called
jiloti).
The Tiwi clap their hands on their buttocks to provide the rhythmic beat for
dancing.
5 A circular space is cleared for dancing by removing all stones and other objects
which might hurt the dancers’ feet. The ground is, of course, only soft dust, so,
once the stones are removed, the dancers can stamp as hard as they like.
6 The reader has to imagine a time interval at this point, during which all the
preliminaries have been gone through and the day of the final dance has arrived.
2 That is, the final dance, yV/o//.
8 Pamatikimi (angel fish) was one of Purukupajli’s wives.
9 Waijai.
10 The informant suddenly remembered that, before the women could dance, the
proceedings had to be begun by Purukupajli. Purukupajli begins the ceremony
by extending his arms horizontally in imitation of the outspread wings of
Xaqkanagki (white-breasted sea eagle), and intoning the necessary ritual phrases.
The congregation respond to each phrase with a shout of ‘ia/\

1. The informant unfortunately omitted the important part of the story dealing
with Xapara’s offer to bring Xifiani back to life. To remedy this deficiency, I obtained
the portion of text from ‘‘nayinta mua majmV down to yi-i-kdtduumi kayi naniara
ji-i-mV from another source and inserted it at this point.
Translation
Long ago Purukupajli lived at Jaqajnti.i We call that country Jagaanti. Long ago.
His son, the little boy, his name was X*Oani — Purukupajli’s son. XilJani. Well
he became sick. He became sick. Then he looked after his son.2 He became really
ill. It went right through him.^ Then he said to Waijai his wife . . . Waijai . . . Long
ago Waijai — when she was a woman^ — well her name . . . her name . . . was Pima.
Pima was her name, Waijai the woman, Purukupajli’s wife.
Then she said to her husband, ‘Hey!’ she said. ‘Yes?’ said Purukupajli. ‘I’m going
hunting for our food^, because we are hungry. When our son is dead we shall be
hungry.’^ So she went. Then Xapara""^ sneaked up there and those two met.® They
met, X^para and Waijai. Pima. They met, and those two — those two were sitting
on the grass, Waijai and Xapara.^
He sang out that he was dead,ia that little boy Purukupajli’s son, dead. ‘Alas,
my dear wife, your son is no more,’ he kept saying. Then ‘Oh!’ she kept calling,
but he stopped her mouth. He stopped her mouth that Xapara. ‘Kwai! Kwai! Your
son is dead,’ he kept calling.ii Then she came — she came — ‘Waijai! Waijai!
Waijai!’ she kept on calling.12 ‘Waijai! Waijai!’ Then Xapara too. Xapara came as
well.
‘Give me our son,’ he said.i3 ‘No.’ ‘Give me our son.’ ‘No.’ ‘Give me our son.
In three days I shall make him well.’i^ ‘No. I shan’t give him to you. Now that
my son is dead we shall all follow him. We shall all have to follow my son. No one
will ever come back. Everyone will die.’ Purukupajli made that law. He was a hard
man in what he said.
He grabbed his throwing sticks — his forked throwing sticks. Purukupajli. He
and his brother started fighting. He too had some forked throwing sticks, Xapara.
They fought and fought and fought and fought until at last he hit him in the eye.is
Purukupajli won the fight. He hit his brother in the eye. He kept hitting him with
his fighting stick. Purukupajli won the fight. Then — ""T^ri, jiuri, Juri, j[uri, luri,
iuri,
He went up.i^ Above. To the sky. That place up in the sky, our
ancestors long ago called it Jugupi. Jugupi they called it long ago. Long ago. We
don’t know, I don’t know. Only my grandfather and my father told me. He told
me. Long ago.
Then, he grabbed his son, he grabbed him, that Xiljani. He took him — ‘We shall
have to go to Xip^n^punumi.is We shall have to go to X'P^rnpunumi. No one will
ever come back. Everyone will die.’ He kept stamping his foot.He left his fighting
sticks behind there.20 Once again — ‘We shall all have to go to Xlp^rnp^i^’J^*No one will ever come back,’ he kept saying, that Purukupajli. He kept stamping84
his foot. He kept stamping his foot. He made some pits with his foot. He has his
mark there. He has his mark in the pits that he made. He has his mark. He lined
up his fighting sticks right through, grabbed his son, and took the dead body. The
sea rose to his middle. The water kept on rising and he kept on stamping his foot.
Now here, now here, now here — then, the sea took him.
Dead body. He took that baby — Purukupaili took TiQ^ni — he took the dead
body lying in the sun.21 He took it. Then only the sea remained. Waijai came
running. She ran — ‘Waijai, Waijai, Waijai, my son, my son, my son, my son’ —
into the sea. She cried for a while. Then it was over. She was still.
Explanatory Notes
1 The informant comes from Xik^la’ru, in western Bathurst Island, and evidently
has very little knowledge of the geography of eastern Melville Island, where
Purukupajli is supposed to have lived. The Melville Islanders place Purukupaili’s
home not at Jaqainti (in north-east Melville Island) but at a place called Taulampi,
near the eastern extremity of the island.
2 That is, Purukupajli looked after
3 That is, the sickness went right through Xitjani.
4 After her death as a woman, Waijai became the curlew.
5 Women do not hunt wallaby, of course, but gather crabs and oysters and
vegetable foods such as yams and wild potatoes.
6 People in mourning enter a state called puijkdmwani in which they are not allowed
to touch food. Waijai foresees that, when their son is dead, they will not be able
to hunt and will have to be fed by their relations.
2 Xapara, Purukupajli’s younger brother and Waijai’s lover, became the moon
after his fight with Purukupajli.
8 They met by previous arrangement, not by accident.
9 Waijai and X^para met to make love. The informant started to say that ‘those
two were copulating’, but broke off and amended this to ‘those two were sitting
on the grass’.
10 Purukupajli sang out that the baby Xipani was dead.
It That is, Purukupajli kept calling.
12 Waijai keeps calling out her own name in guilt and remorse. The name Waijai
is evidently imitative of the cry of the curlew.
13 Xapara has to say ‘our son’, not ‘your son’, because, in the Tiwi kinship system,
his relation to the child is the same as that of Purukupajli. That is, -mduani means
both ‘son’ and ‘brother’s son’.
14 The Tiwi believe that Xapara, the moon, dies every month and comes back to
life on the third day. In offering to bring X'Oani back to life he was offering eternal
life to all men, but Purukupajli refused the offer and chose death for everyone.
15 Purukupajli hit Xapara in the eye.
15 ‘JwH, iuri, etc.’ represents Xapara’s cries of pain as he flew up into the sky and
became the moon.
12 That is, Xapara went up.
18 Xipampunumi was the old Tiwi name for the Australian mainland, which they
could just see from the eastern extremity of Melville Island. They believed it

2.1 Coordination
The coordination of clauses within a complex sentence has to be effected in Tiwi
by intonation alone, as there is no form equivalent to English ‘and’. The end of
the sentence as a whole is marked by a fall of intonation, while the non-final character
of the included clauses (other than the last) is signalled by a final rise of intonation.
In the examples given below a full stop is used to indicate a sentence-final fall of
intonation and a comma to indicate a non-final rise.

Note the optional use of the form apa to signal non-finality, and of ki ‘then’
(sometimes combined with apa) to mark the final clause in a sequence of coordinate
clauses referring to a chronological sequence of events.

Sometimes a sequence of two verbs which are very closely related, in that they
share a single subject, are treated as one clause and given only one clause intonation
pattern, i.e. there is no pause or rise of intonation at the end of the first verb.

There arc two types of questions — yes-no questions and k-questions (the latter
corresponding to the wh- questions of English). K-questions are a requc.st for sub¬
stantial information but yes-no questions seek no more than the confirmation or
denial of information.
1.6.1 Yes-no questions
Yes-no questions arc marked by the use of an interrogative intonation contour
(rising at the end) and, optionally, by the insertion of an interrogative enclitic -ana,
which is suffixed to the final word of the sentence, but refers not just to that word
but to the sentence as a whole. The commonest and simplest method is by intonation
alone.
Jliikajimi?
Did you do it?
you-do
waija
juapa?
Have you eaten?
already you-ate
pipjla pajawani?
Arc you hungry?
you
hungry68
Alternatively, intonation and suffixation may be combined, and there is apparently
no difference of meaning between the forms which are marked by intonation alone
and those which are marked by both intonation and suffixation.
iiikdudm-ma?
Did you do it?
you did-int
waija
alreadytuap-ana?
you ate-intHave you eaten?ijipta pajawan-ana?
Are you hungry?
you
hungry-int
In non-past verbal sentences the verb has to be changed into the subjunctive in
yes-no questions, e.g. auakauimi ‘He does it’ -> jimakdjimi ‘Does he do it?’ apakauimi
‘He’s going to do it’
jimatakajimi ‘Is he going to do it?’ (See Morphology, 1.1.8
for details of subjunctive verb forms.) In past tense questions the verb is in the
indicative.
1.6.2 K-questions
k-questions are formed by inserting a question word in any structural slot and by
placing that slot in sentence-initial position. An interrogative intonation contour
may also be used. The question words are kuwani ‘who?’, kamini ‘what?’, maka
‘where?’ auijari ‘when?’, aupana ‘how?’, and kama ‘why?’.
kuwani tiikajawala?
kamini nampitamaunti?","[83, 84]"
"2SYLLABLES
Tiwi has both syllables with initial margin and syllables without initial margin
and either type may be either open or closed, i.e., CV (as in the initial syllable of
ma'manta, ‘friends’), CVC (as in the initial syllable of mim'pini, ‘fiea’), V (as in the
initial syllable of u'pwani, ‘fly’) and VC (as in the initial syllable of am'papa, ‘she
eats’).
The syllable-initial margin may be any one of the fourteen consonant phonemes
or any one of the four permitted initial consonant clusters /pw/, Ikwj, Imwj,
e.g., pwa'mika, ‘death adder’, kwam'pini, ‘fighting man’, mwa'uini, ‘mangrove worm’,
wuru'ijwaua, ‘spirit’. The syllable nucleus may be any one of the four vowel phonemes,
but a is the only vowel to be preceded by an initial cluster. The nucleus may be
followed by a retroflex vocoid /j/, as in I'wautaj, ‘bush’. Syllable closure is by any
one of the four nasals, jmj, Inj, jnl, fijl, or (rarely) by the lateral, ///, e.g., mam'pupa,
‘canoe’, an'jlora, ‘male wallaby’, man'tani, ‘friend’, muij'kwani, ‘stone axe’, walta'riija,
‘clothes’. Post-nuclear juj is restricted to occurrence preceding alveolar consonants.
Syllable-final nasals or laterals are homorganic with the initial consonant of the
following syllable.
The generalised formula for Tiwi syllables would be (Ci) (C2) V (C3) (C4), taking
Cl as any consonant, C2 as w, V as any vowel, C3 as j, and C4 as any nasal or lateml,
and observing all the restrictions stated in the preceding paragraph. The syllable
types permitted by this formula (with the restrictions) are tabulated below.

clusters are not very common.
PROBLEMS OF ANALYSIS1. Treatment of diphthongs
There are a number of diphthongs in Tiwi and the problem which arises in analysing
them is to know whether they are one syllable or two. For example, are kwai, ‘shout’,
and joi, ‘dance’, monosyllabic or bisyllabic?
The vowel sequences which actually occur are ia, ua, aa, iu, uu, au, ii, ui, ai, oi,
e.g., 'yia, ‘I’, 'nua, ‘you’, tcfapa, ‘Eat!’ tjiu'wani, ‘my younger brother’, tuu'lua, ‘head’,
ff'‘Throw it!’ kii'j(ini, ‘little boy’, ijuUd'mamti, ‘I want it\ jaraka'pai, ‘crocodile’,
'joi, ‘dance’. Of these sequences, ia, ua, iu and ui could be regarded as certainly
bisyllabic. The remainder — aa, uu, ii, au, ai, oi — present a problem. The native
speaker of English, listening to these sequences, would certainly hear ia, ua, iu and ui
as bisyllabic, but would probably hear most instances of the remaining sequences
as monosyllabic. The question is, to what extent does what the Tiwi speaker ‘hears’
differ from what the English speaker ‘hears’? On the level of phonic substance,
aa, uu and // differ very little from the English long vowels a:, u: and
and au,
ai and oi differ very little from the corresponding English diphthongs, and, as these
English long vowels and diphthongs each constitute a single syllable nucleus, it is
natural for the native speaker of English to suppose that the corresponding Tiwi
sequences are also monosyllabic. English and Tiwi speakers are conditioned
differently, however, and it is necessary to disregard the interpretation of the data
which seems natural to a native speaker of English and to try to find out how the
Tiwi interpret it.","[33, 34]"

9 They now leave the dancing place and move off towards the grave, a few yards
away.
They all creep up quietly towards the grave. When they are close enough, there
is a great shout of ‘Oau!’, they all throw their spears, run forward, and hurl
themselves onto the grave. The purpose of the whole procedure is presumably
to drive away evil spirits.
i^The crying is a highly conventionalised crying and wailing. The principal
mourners pretend to be about to hit themselves with bottles and tins, and have
to be restrained in case they do themselves some harm.
12 They start clapping their buttocks with their hands to provide the rhythmic beat
for dancing.
1^ The chief mourner has to pay the ‘workers’ who made the grave posts and assisted
at the burial. In former times payment used to be in the form of spears and other
artifacts, but these days payment is in cash, hundreds of dollars changing hands
at a big ceremony.
1'^ He dances round the circle, finishing in front of the ‘worker’, but facing away
from him. He then bends down and passes the belt or other object to him
between his legs.
15 Each worker shouts ‘Ail’ as he receives his payment.
16 The final stage of the ceremony is when the grave posts are taken and stood in
the ground round the grave.
12 When the posts are stood up, the five men who made the posts dance by themselves.","[129, 130]"

Explanatory Note
1 Text 9 is an account of the preparation of kwoka (xamia palm nuts) by Xajua
(the friar bird), when she was a woman. The nuts are first roasted, then cracked
open and mashed, and then left to soak in fresh water for three days to remove
the poison in them. The process was discovered by Xs-iua and has been handed
down through successive generations of women to the present day. The xamia
palm is very plentiful on Melville and Bathurst Islands, and, being so readily
available, kwoka used to be the basic item of Tiwi diet, functioning roughly as
bread does in our own society.10

Translation
Long ago they called him Puruti,i when he was a man, He used to catch turtles
and fish. They called him ‘good eyes’.2 They called him that. He caught turtles,
he caught dugong, he caught stingrays — barramundi, skinny fish, red snappers,
bream, catfish, fresh water fish.3 When the water was dirty, he didn’t mind. He
used to go out in the morning — when they fished with a spear.^ He used to go right
out in the middle water — in the middle. He used to catch big fish in the morning
with a spear.
Explanatory Notes
Puruti is the osprey.
The Tiwi are strongly impressed by the osprey’s ability to see and catch fish no
matter how murky the water is. They believe his eyes have some kind of magical
power.
3 Actual ospreys, of course, only catch fish, not turtles and dugong.
“t Before they came into contact with mainland Aboriginal culture (about 1900),
the Tiwi had no fishing spears. They used to fish with a plain wooden spear without
barbs, called munipuija. They learned about fishing spears from the Jiwadja people,
soon after 1900. These are long poles with three sharpened wire prongs fastened
to one end, and are a much more effective means of catching fish.

Jarakati made bark canoes.• He said to X’J'Oini, he said to
‘Hey! We’ve
got to make bark canoes.’ ‘Well, which tree are you going to have? I’m going to
have a woollybutt,’ Ji-iioini said. ‘No good at all,’ Jarakati said, ‘No good at all.
How about this stringy bark? A stringy bark will be all right.’2100
Well, they made them, and his was easily the best. Jarakati made a good canoe
and Xi-iiqini made a bad one. A bad one. Then he scolded him — ‘Why have you
done it so badly? Why have you been so stupid?’ he said. Juigini thought for a
while. ‘Why yes, you are right, brother-in-law,’ he said — Jarakati and Juigini
were brothers-in-law. Ji-bgini had been introduced to kmlama by him.3
So it was Jarakati who made the best canoes.
Explanatory Notes
1 The text deals with the making of the first bark canoes by Jarakati (white-breasted
sea eagle) and Xijioini (red-backed sea eagle). The Tiwi acquired dug-out canoes
through their contact with the Jiwadja people (a mainland Aboriginal tribe)
about 1900. Before that they had only bark canoes. The Aboriginal bark canoe
consisted simply of a piece of bark eighteen or twenty feet long, bent into the
shape of a canoe and sewn up at both ends with vine. The stitching was caulked
with resin and two sticks acted as thwarts. There were no seats, rudder, mast or
sail.
2 Stringy bark is good for canoes but woollybutt bark is no good at all, as it cracks
too easily. In the text the knowledge and experience of the mature Jarakati is
contrasted with the ignorance of the younger Xi-iir|ini3 Xi-iii]ini was Jarakati’s pakili^ipa, that is, the young man introduced to the third
stage of initiation by him at a kujlama ceremony. (See Text 3.)12

Translation
Mutati and Jarama'ju.i ‘Hey!’ said Jarama'ju. ‘Yes?’ said Mutati. ‘What are we
going to do?’ ‘We’ve got to rub fire. We’ve got to make fire sticks.’2 ‘All right then.’
‘Because we’re going for wallaby because we are hungry.’3 Mutati rubbed his fire
stick and Jaroma'ju did the same. He made fire.^ He held the fire in his hand. ‘It’s
hot, it’s hot, it’s hot!’ he kept yelling. He burnt his hand.
Jaroma'ju made fire as well. ‘You go that way,’ he said, ‘I’ll go this way.’ They
made fire — and wallaby spears. Those wallaby spears are what we hunt wallaby
with. They used to call Jaromo'ju ‘good hunter’, and we follow him, all us people,
because he started it first, him and Mutati.5 We call him ‘the one who can hunt in
stillness.’^ Jorsms'ju is a good hunter of wallaby. He used to kill ten or twenty.
A good hunter of wallaby.
Explanatory Notes
1 Mutati is the fork-tailed kite and Jarsmo'ju the wedge-tailed eagle.
2 The Tiwi fire stick was a stick of hard wood sharpened at one end, which was
placed in a hole in a piece of soft wood and spun very rapidly between the palms
until the friction generated enough heat to start a fire. Mutati invented this in
the distant past, when he was a man.
3 The Tiwi set fire to the grass when they are hunting as this drives the animals
out of their hiding places, and makes it easier to see them afterwards when the
fire has died down and the ground is left bare. This is why Mutati and Jsromo'ju
have to have a fire stick before they can start hunting.
4 That is, Mutati did.
5 Jarama'ju invented the art of hunting and Mutati invented fire. The wedge-tailed
eagle is, in fact, very expert in catching wallaby, but the fork-tailed kite lives
on much smaller game.
<5 It is very difficult to catch wallaby when there is no wind to cover the noise of
one’s approach. The Tiwi admire the wedge-tailed eagle’s ability to do this.13

while he was making spears.We give him that name because he ran while he was
making spears.® The sea! He went under, under, under, under, under, under, and
then —the spear came up first. ‘You are the crocodile now,’ they said.9 Tajuni,
takampuija, they called him, jaratjkapajluni.^^ They called him that because there
are many crocodiles in the sea.n In the beginning he lived as a man.
Explanatory Notes
t Jarokapai is the salt water crocodile.
2 Cape Fourcroy, at the western end of Bathurst Island.
3 Mashed xamia palm nuts were one of the basic items of Tiwi diet. (See Text 9).
4 He was making the heavy, broad-headed ironwood spears called ajawunirjkiji.
The alternative name for these is tilipajitja. The crocodile is associated with these
spears (and with the type called jutjkwaliti), because of the resemblance the Tiwi
see between the row of long barbs on the head of the spear and the row of points
on the crocodile’s tail. The resemblance is closer in the case of the Jutjkwaliti, as
these have barbs on one side only while the ajawunitjkui have barbs on both sides.
5 That is, the other wives were all making baskets.
<5 They shouted as they ran forward to attack him.
2 When he ran, he took the spear he was making with him.
® That is, the crocodile is given the name jarakapai because he ran while making
spears.
^ The spear came up first and became the crocodile’s tail.
tajuni, takampuija, jaraijkapajuni and jarakapai are all alternative names for the
crocodile. It is the custom among the Tiwi to place a taboo on the names of
deceased persons, on all names bestowed by them, and on all words which closely
resemble any of these names. Consequently, the Tiwi need to have at least two
names for every important item of their experience, so that, if one name becomes
taboo, the other is still available. (See Hart 1930b for an account of this custom.)
11 It is not clear why any of the crocodile’s names should have been given to him
for this reason.","[113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118]"

Long ago — long ago Maaimpunini spoke.i ‘All of you are to come tomorrow for
a meeting.’ ‘All right,’ said number two, er number two, er his younger brother.2
He answered his elder brother.
Everyone came to Maaimpupini’s camp. They all sat down. ‘We have to exchange
women. We have to exchange women. Brother-in-law! Brother-in-law,’ he said.^
‘Yes?’ ‘I shall give you my sister. You will have to give me your sister. Nephewin-lawl’^ ‘Yes?’ he said. ‘Give me your sister’s daughter. I shall give you my sister’s
daughter. Then I shall give you . . . first I shall give you my sister.s Then, when
she has had a lot of babies, you will all have to give to one another.<5 You others
here — when my sister’s daughter has had many babies, you will have to exchange
for them. Give them your sisters’ daughters. Give them to your nephews-in-law.
And you must give one to me as well, so that, when I have got many daughters of
my own, I can give them to my sisters’ sons.”^ And then he — you will have your
mother-in-law.8 You will have your mother-in-law, man of the Red Ochre clan.
You man of the Red Ochre clan, you will have your mother-in-law. And you, man
of the Stingray clan, you too will have your mother-in-law. Just one. And I
Maiimpunini, I too shall have one mother-in-law. And you, man of the Flying Fox
clan, you too have one mother-in-law. Give to your sisters’ sons, you man of the
Flying Fox clan. Men of the Bird clan! You too are a group by yourself. You are
one big group — a totem — a clan. You are one clan. You are one totem. You
must exchange your younger sisters. You men of the Flying Fox clan, too, are one
totemic group.’Explanatory Notes
1 Text 2 is concerned with the establishment of Tiwi marriage laws and totemic
groups by Maaimpuijini (a small bird). Other texts suggest that Tokwampini
(another small bird) also took some part in the establishment of these laws and
groups, but the present text makes no mention of the part he played. The names
Tokwampini and Maiimpunini do not refer to particular species but are both
general names for unidentified small birds.
There are twenty-one totemic groups — jimiija or pu'kwi as the Tiwi call them
— and these are arranged in four large groups (only three in Majimpunini’s
time, but a regrouping has occurred since then). Membership of the groups is
by matrilineal descent and marriage is exogamous. A man usually marries his
mother’s brother’s daughter (as she cannot possibly belong to the same totem
as Ego), but, as the number of wives is unlimited, other wives are sought through
a system of exchange. The usual thing is to exchange younger sisters or sisters’
daughters with men of another totem (more strictly with men whose mothers
and sisters are of a different totemic group from Ego).
A full list of the totemic groups is given in the Thesaurus.
2 Apparently by ‘number two’ the informant meant Wujiuponila, ‘man of the
Fire clan’.
3 Tiwi -nimini (here translated ‘brother-in-law’) is the man with whom one ex¬
changes younger sisters. He is thus one’s wife’s brother and one’s sister’s husband.
-piniwini (translated ‘nephew-in-law’) is the man with whom one exchanges
sisters’ daughters. He is thus both one’s sister’s daughter’s husband and one’s
wife’s mother’s brother.
5 MajimpuQini is here again speaking to his -nimini, of course.
<5 That is, when the man who gets Majimpuqini’s sister has a lot of daughters,
he will have to give them away in exchange for other girls.
It was usual to marry one’s mother’s brother’s daughter as she could not belong
to the same totem as oneself.
8 Majimpurjini here starts to enunciate the totemic groups. As marriage is outside
the group, and as membership of the group is by matrilineal descent, a Tiwi man
has to know which women are his potential mothers-in-law.","[100, 101, 102]"

(b) Nasal closure
Apart from //-, ‘you’, ji-, ‘he’, ti-, ‘she’, and perhaps wu-, ‘they’, subject prefixes
take a homorganic nasal closure {m or n) preceding morphemes with initial p or t.
The process is primarily concerned with the combination of subject prefixes with
either of the two tense markers p3- and t3-, but is sometimes extended to cover
combination with other morphemes with initial p or t:) - + p3- -h -punii)3m-p3-J3-puni1I hit her (non-past)1 3f.nphit1)3- 4- t3- -t- -punii)3n-t3-J3-puniII hit her (past)f.phitNasal closure of the subject prefix is obligatory only in certain morphological
combinations in which the degree of morphological cohesion is very high — i.e.
1)3- + p3-, a- 4- p3-, and t)3- (‘we’ or ‘you’) 4- p3- or t3-. In other morphological
combinations the process is optional.
(c) Deletion of final vowel
The only subject prefixes to have their final vowel deleted preceding a morpheme
with initial vowel are wu-, ‘they’, and n3-, ‘you’:
wu- + -apa -> w-apa

Preceding morphemes with initial p (i.e., preceding Cd-, Ca- and Ilb stems, all of
which have an initial p inserted by a morphophonological process) pd- becomes
completely fused with this p and ceases to have any separate manifestation in the
phonemic representation, although it remains distinct in the morphophonological
representation:

by means of a w glide. Initial w is inserted when atd- occurs in word-initial position
and initial p when it occurs following ma-, ‘subjunctive’. The final vowel is subject
to change preceding a vowel or semi-vowel in the normal way:

2.1.7 Object prefixes
The object prefixes are as follows: direct object prefixes — mani-, ‘me’, maiji-, ‘you
sg’, mani-, ‘you sg and me’, mawani-, ‘us ex’, mani-, ‘you pi’, wani-, ‘them’, mani‘us inc’; indirect object prefixes — ma-, ‘me’, mat}la-, ‘you sg’, ma-, ‘him’, niara-,
‘her’, ma-, ‘you and me’, mapa-, ‘us ex’, maka-, ‘you pi’, japa-, ‘them’, ma-, ‘us inc’.
These prefixes arc subject to both initial and final changes, as described below.
Initial changes
The initial m of those object prefixes which begin with this phoneme is changed
to tj following pa-, ‘non-past’, or ma-, ‘subjunctive’, and in word-initial position:

campTextual Notes
1 Text 4 is only a small portion of a long narrative in which the informant wanders
freely over much of Tiwi mythology. The rest of the material in this long narrative
is omitted from the present collection of texts because of the informant’s un¬
fortunate tendency to confuse the Tiwi myths with those of the Jiwadja people.
The informant (Harry Carpenter) is half Jiwadja, and the two tribal cultures
are very mixed up in his mind. Linguistically, however, his material is good Tiwi,
and it is a pity that more of it could not be used.
2 lu-u'ui ji-na-ui-mari is ungrammatical as the two subject prefixes should agree
in gender. It should read ju-u'ui ji-na-ui-mari (he went and got water), as
Kujipurani (the subject of both verbs) is masculine. The third-person-singular
past tense masculine subject prefix is ji- (variant ju-), except when there is a thirdperson-singular feminine direct object. In this case the feminine prefix ji- (variant
ju-) is used as the subject prefix as it has the additional function of expressing
gender of object. This explains why ji-i-maru-'ui pupkauipa, ‘He took the paper
bark’, is grammatical, as the direct object, pupkauipa, is feminine.
3 A portion of the text is omitted at this point as the informant wandered off onto
another story.
4 Another digression is omitted at this point.
5 Another error of gender occurs in pa-tawa puuipjaripa, ‘the tree on top’.
puuipjaripa, ‘tree’, is feminine and should have selected the feminine pronoun
pi-tawa.
Translation
Then he went and found her, Jarakati’s wife, IJajiqa.i She was cooking wallaby.
She was cooking wallaby, that woman IJajiga. Then Kujipurani came and found
her. She went on cooking, and when he saw what she was doing, ‘Oh!’ he said,
‘Oh!’2 ‘What do you want?’ she said, ‘The liver?’ ‘No.’ ‘Well, what do you want?
The intestines?’ ‘No.’ ‘What do you want then?’ ‘No.’ ‘Oh!’ Now she guessed it,
that woman IJaJii]a.3 ‘You had better go for water. Go and get water,’ she said.4
He took a paper bark basket, like this one.s Then he went and got some water.
She looked at it — ‘Oh! It’s dirty. Throw it away.’ She threw the water away. ‘Go
back again. Bring some clean water.’ He went back again. He already had an92
erection, that Kujipurani, Kujipurani already had an erection because he had
looked — he had looked out of the corner of his eye. He went running about, he
went waddling about, that Kujipurani.6 He kept looking — dirty water. He kept
looking — dirty water. He kept looking — dirty water. Then here was some clean
water. He brought it back. He’s coming. She looked — ‘All right.’ She drank the
water and he rolled her over. He rolled her over. Then he had finished. Then he
had finished having sex with her, that Kujipurani.7 She was his elder sister,
Kujipurani and IJaiiga.s
Then he found some honey there. Jaqkanagki found some honey.9 He came
back. ‘Brother-in-law! We are going for some honey. You will have to climb up as
you are more agile.’ He was lying because he wanted to hit him out there.
Then they went and he climbed up for the honey. The other one climbed up
behind.io They started chopping it and ‘Crack!’ it went. ‘Hey! Brother-in-law!
I think it’s going to crack.’H ‘No, no. It’s my knuckles. It’s my knuckles.’ They
went on chopping and ‘Crack!’ it went again that tree. ‘Hey! Brother-in-law! I’m
going to fall.’ ‘No, no. Go further out. No really. It’s my knuckles. Go further out.’
Then he fell down. He fell down. He fell down, that Kujipurani. The branch was
on top.i2 IJajiga was standing there on the ground. When he fell down, that was
it. She smashed him. She kept on hitting him, that woman IJajiqa. They kept on
hitting Kujipurani. Finished. He went waddling back to camp.
Explanatory Notes
1 That is, Kujipurani went and found IJajipa. The three characters in the story
are Kujipurani (frilly lizard), his sister ijajiga (black cockatoo^ and her husband
Jarakati (white-breasted sea eagle). Jarakati’s alternative name is Xapkanagki.
The text relates the seduction of IJajirja by her brother and Jarakati’s subsequent
revenge.
2 IJajiga was sitting with her legs open and Kujipurani’s exclamation was caused
by sexual excitement.
3 That is, IJajiqa guessed that her brother had come after her for sexual reasons.
4 She sends her brother off to get water as a way of putting off his sexual advances.
5 The Tiwi usually carried water in a stringy bark basket, not paper bark. When
the informant said ijdniijaii ijd-naijki, ‘like this one’, he pointed to a tin.
6 Kujipurani waddles because he is impeded in running by the erection. The frilly
lizard has, in fact, a rather comical waddling gait.
2 The actual Tiwi expression used at this point was ti-i-pimi ji-i-kuu'ui, ‘he had
finished hitting her’, but this is a euphemistic expression.
8 Some informants say that IJajiqa was Kujipurani’s younger sister.
9 Xagksnagki used the honey as an excuse to get Kujipurani to climb the tree.
Xhe honey is in a hollow branch high up in the tree.
10 Kujipurani climbed up first and Xar)k3nagki climbed up behind.
11 Kujipurani is sitting out on the branch and Xagkonagki is sitting close to the
trunk. They are chopping the branch to make a hole in it so they can get the
honey out.
12 The branch fell on top of Kujipurani,93

pl-thisTextual Note
1 The informant actually said wuta japkanapki wuta narakati, ‘eagle and eagle’,
but what he meant to say was wuta japkanapki wut alikampwajni, ‘eagle and
pelican’, and I have amended the text accordingly, jarakati (pronounced narakati
by this informant) is simply an alternative name for japkanapki, the white-breasted
sea eagle.
Translation
They made a dancing place, a dancing place for Alikampwajni and his brotherin-law Xarjkanagki.i Then they danced at the dancing place. They competed with
one another, Alikampwajni and Xarjkonagki. They did the waruma.’^ And these
people here follow them in that when they dance, these people on these two islands.
And, when they are all dead, others will dance just the same. Women and men will
dance that same one that was made by Alikampwajni and X^^Dksnagki.","[105, 106, 107, 108, 109]"

(a) the overall incidence of y is very low. This provides factual support for the
view expressed in 1.1 that this phoneme is not a properly integrated member of
the system; (b) the functional load of / and t in word-initial position is relatively
low, compared with that of p or A:; (c) /, r, y and a rarely or never occur in wordinitial position; (d) the list-frequency figures for word-initial tj, n and // are very
low because of the restriction on their occurrence stated in 1.4. The text frequency
figures are considerably higher because of the initial occurrence of these phonemes
in several of the commonest personal pronouns and subject prefixes; (e) the non¬
initial figures for j are very low because of the difficulty of distinguishing this
phoneme intervocalically from a merely automatic glide between vowels. The
sequences written as ia, iu and ii could always be written as ija, iju and iji, respectively
(e.g., '^ia, T’, could be written '////a), and if this were done, the figures for non¬
initial j would be greatly increased.",[32]

Subordination and coordination are not mutually exclusive processes. A sub¬
ordinate clause may be dependent on a whole sequence of coordinate clauses, and
subordinate clauses may themselves be coordinated so that one sequence of clauses
as a whole may be dependent on another sequence of clauses as a whole.
