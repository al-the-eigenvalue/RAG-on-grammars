"POSSESSIVES
1. Possession
is shown by placing the possessor noun after the
noun that is owned.
The two nouns
(or noun phrases)
are connected by the -a/null enclitic
if the possessor
is a common noun and
by the -as/-s enclitic
if the owner is a proper noun.
Unless
itissomethingthatisconsideredtobeapartoftheowner,thepossessed noun has a na- prefix.
This prefix comes before the
plural prefix.
Some kinship terms do not have the na- prefix
when they are possessed.
This fact implies
that some kinsmen areconsidered,insomeway,gyigyeda huwaap

Reduplication
is a morphological
device in which part of
a word is copied or repeated.
Verbs agree in number with their
absolutive
(transitive object or intransitive
subject).
Adjectives agree in number with the nouns they modify.
Verbs and
adjectives
show number agreement
in the same way that nouns show
number.
There are several types of reduplication.
2. The most common type of plural reduplication consists of
copying the first consonant of the word and prefixing
it to the
word along with a vowel and a kay
(k).
This type of reduplication is referred to as Class
I, or CVk-,
reduplication.
The
vowel that occurs
in the prefix is determined by the first consonant of the prefix.

It takes an -a or
null enclitic connective:
-a if it ends in a stop,
affricate or
fricative
and null if it ends in a vowel or sonorant.
Numerals
for humans,
long objects,
canoes,
humans aboard a conveyance,
and unit measures
can stand alone as nouns.
General numerals
are used for houses,
dreams,
masks,
flowers,
ghosts,
spheres,abstractthings,andanythingelsenotspecificallydesignatedby the other classes.
Animal numerals
are used garments,
skins,
anything
flat,
e.g., mats,
also for bak'wis
(Bigfoot),
hawhaw
(a supernatural
animal),
and naxnox
(supernatural beings).
The
numerals
for canoes are used for any vehicle.

—DETERMINERS1. Definite
articles
and demonstratives
occur after the nouns
they determine.
The noun takes an -a or null enclitic
suffix
when it is followed by such a determiner.
Determiners do not
occur in the same noun phrase with numerals.
The determiners
are:

the noun they modify.
A noun phrase may have both a numeral and
an adjective.

A noun phrase

when attached to words,
change
their grammatical
relationships
(actor,
recipient of action,
etc.)
and sometimes
their grammatical
function
(noun, verb,
etc.).
2. The suffix -x
(sometimes
-k)
derives
a word that refers to a
thing,
place,
or activity that is touched by or affected by the
original word,
or that is in some way a consequence of the original word.
The relationship between the original word and the derived word is often metaphorical.

The purpose of this reference grammar is to provide bilingual teachers,
teacher's
aides and other interested persons with
a nontechnical
introduction to the Coast Tsimshian
language.
This grammar is designed to be used in conjunction with A Prac-ttealDtettonaryoftheCoastTsimshtanLanguage,compiledandedited by John Dunn,
published by the National Museum of Man,
Ottawa,
Ontario.
It is also designed for persons who speak and
write English and who understand the basic grammatical
structure
of English.
It is not intended as a set of lesson plans.
However,
the teacher of Tsimshian might use it as a guide for developing instructional materials.
The grammar should also prove
useful to advanced students
of Tsimshian.
The idea for a reference grammar
for Tsimshian was conceived
in Metlakatla,
Alaska,
in the summer of 1976,
during a community
workshop
in Tsimshian grammatical
analysis.
This project was
given further impetus by the language workshop
sponsored by the
Hartley Bay Band in Hartley Bay,
British Columbia,
during the
summer of 1978.
The participants
of both these workshops have
contributed enormously
to the completion of the reference grammar.
Finally
the National Museum of Man has supported the
preparation of this manuscript
as well as much of the field
research upon which it is based.
While an enormous amount of time and effort has gone into
the preparation of the grammar,
even after more than ten years
of field work and analysis,
it is still only a beginning.
Many
of the more sophisticated and complex intracacies
of Tsimshian
syntax and semantics
still remain to be studied.
The interrogatives,
negatives
and complex sentences have not been so thor-oughlystudiedastoprovideacompletemanuscript
undoubtedly contains many
other shortcomings,
for all of which
sible.","[14, 15]"
