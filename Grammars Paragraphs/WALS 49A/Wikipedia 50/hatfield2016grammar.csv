"556Appendix E: Animal and Plant Species
This appendix is a trilingual dictionary including only Mehek names of animal and plant
species. Section E.1 includes all the animals, and section E.2 includes all the plants. Within these
sections, the names are listed first alphabetically by category, then alphabetically within each
category by species name. A generic English and Tok Pisin gloss of each species is listed in most
cases, as there are not common names for most Mehek species in these languages. However, in
cases where a specific name does exist in either English or Tok Pisin, it is listed. Included below
in the KEY are two main lists: a schematic representation of each entry showing what
information is included and the formatting of each section, followed by a summary of all the
categories used for ease of look up of specific species names.","[572, 573]"
"99Gender is syntactically important in verbal agreement in the third person singular
only. In cases where the gender is overtly marked, the verb will agree with the noun
phrase. However, there are many instances where the gender is not overtly marked or
changes to the diminutive in the course of the utterance. In these cases, the agreement
on the verb will be with the most recently used gender marking. However, the
overwhelming majority of cases of gender-marking in the third person singular are
masculine. Only in cases where there is a clear feminine actor will the feminine marker
be used.
Most animate nouns with exclusively feminine gender are those which are not easy
to identify the sex of, particularly insects and other small creatures. There are some kin
terms that are exclusively feminine (though many kin terms can be applied to men and
women, see ยง10.1). There are only six inanimate nouns which have feminine gender.
Table 21 lists all the attested nouns that only appear with feminine gender.","[115, 116]"
"A GRAMMAR OF MEHEK

Adam Hatfield
June 1, 2016A dissertation submitted to the
Faculty of the Graduate School of
the University at Buffalo, State University of New York
in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the
degree of
Doctor of PhilosophyDepartment of LinguisticsAcknowledgements
The work in this dissertation was made possible by two grants from the National
Science Foundation (NSF). The first grant was under Matthew Dryer, my major
professor. The second grant was an NSF Dissertation Improvement Grant, BCS1263554,
designed to allow for additional data collection. Below are lists of the main consultants
who provided data, time, generosity and hospitality to me while learning Mehek. The
primary consultants are the ones who provided ongoing and/or daily time for long
periods. The secondary consultants provided large amounts of data over a fixed time
period, either hours or multiple times over several days. In addition to those listed
below, there were well over 50 different people who gave different kinds of language
data. Their time and assistance are graciously appreciated. I would also like to thank the
members of my dissertation committee (listed below), and the faculty, staff and
students of the Linguistics Department at the State University of New York at Buffalo.

This is a grammar which provides a detailed linguistic description of the phonology,
morphology, syntax, discourse, lexicon and cultural environment of the Mehek language
and its speakers. Mehek is a language spoken in Papua New Guinea by approximately
6300 people. It belongs to the Sepik language family, Tama branch. The theoretical
background employed is Basic Linguistic Theory. Mehek shares general features with
many non-Austronesian Papuan languages, including: a relatively simple phonological
system; verb-final word order, typically SOV; agglutinative verbal morphology; and the
morphology of other word classes is relatively simple.xviChapter 1: Introduction
1.0 Overview
Mehek (ISO code nux) is a language of the Tama branch of the Sepik family spoken
in Sandaun Province of Papua New Guinea. There are approximately 6300 speakers
(Gordon 2005) spread out over an area of roughly 65 square miles. The data for this
study were gathered in three field trips during the summers of 2010, 2012 and 2014.
The total length of the trips was nine months and time was spent in each of the Mehekspeaking villages, though the primary location was the village of Wilwil (see ยง2.1 below).
There is no prior published grammatical information on Mehek, though some
neighboring languages have had partial Bible translations done or a grammatical sketch
done.
The goal of the present grammar is to provide a detailed linguistic description of the
phonology, morphology, syntax, discourse, lexicon and cultural environment of Mehek
and its speakers. In the present chapter, information on the language and speakers is
given and the following areas will be discussed: linguistic scene and language vitality
(ยง1.1), genetic classification of Mehek (ยง1.2), previous research (ยง1.3), dialects (ยง1.4),
fieldwork (ยง1.5) and theoretical background (ยง1.6). Chapter 2 will discuss topics relevant
to culture and environment. After that, chapter 3 will provide a brief grammatical sketch
of the language and its primary features. Chapters 4-11 will discuss linguistic topics of
the language, specifically: phonology (chapter 4), word classes (chapter 5), nouns and1noun phrases (chapter 6), verbs and verb phrases (chapter 7), clause types (chapter 8),
clausal relations (chapter 9), discourse and paralanguage (chapter 10), and lexical fields
(chapter 11). Following these chapters are several appendices of additional information
and reference. These include sample texts (Appendix A); multi-lingual dictionaries:
Mehek-English-Tok Pisin (Appendix B), English-Mehek (Appendix C), and Tok PisinMehek (Appendix D); lists of animal and plant Species (Appendix E); thematic vocabulary
(Appendix F); personal name index (Appendix G); names, songs and whistles (Appendix
H); place and clan names (Appendix I); and garamut drum beats (Appendix J).","[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18]"

There is no marking of number on nouns in Mehek, though the noun phrase clitics
serve as an indication of number within the noun phrase. Number is also coded on the
verb. The language distinguishes three numbers, singular, dual, and plural. However,
though not common, dual number, whether it involves a dual pronoun, a dual noun
phrase clitic, or dual agreement on the verb, can be used to indicate a small number of
people or items rather than exactly two. While the dual typically literally indicates two
of something, in contexts where it is clear that exactly two is not strictly implied, the use
of the dual takes on a paucal meaning. In example (23), a group of children was
exhorted to each go gather a small amount of edible leaves and then to pool their
findings to give away. It was clear that they would not each gather only two leaves each,
as a typical collection of leaves would involve more than two leaves. In this case, the
dual was meant to indicate a smaller than usual number of leaves.","[124, 125]"

Except in cases of complete reduplication (R), there can be a change of consonant
from the first word to the second (C) or of vowel (V and V*). In the case of a vowel
change, in most cases, the second word has a lower vowel than in the first word (V). In a
few instances, the second vowel has the same height, but is further back (V*). The
commonality between these is that the vowel which changes is always a high or midfront vowel in the first word and is either lowered or backed in the second. There are
also a few forms which have a common variant form which may have a different type of
change. These are listed in parenthesis.
Most of the parts of the following ideophonic adverbs do not occur outside these
combinations as independent morphemes; these only occur in the combinations listed
in Table 44. However, those marked with an asterisk have parts that can appear as
independent morphemes. When they do, they are nouns or verbs, but not adverbs.","[288, 289]"

There are two types of morphemes that serve to mark a noun for roles other than
subject or object, signalling a semantic relationship between a noun phrase and a verb.
These are the locative/instrumental clitic =k, discussed in ยง5.10.1, and relational nouns,
discussed in ยง5.10.2.
5.10.1 Locative and Instrumental =k
The clitic =k counts as a noun phrase clitic in the sense that it cannot co-occur in a
noun phrase with a noun phrase clitic coding number and gender and occurs in the
same position in the noun phrase as the other noun phrase clitics, following the noun
and following an adjective or possessive pronoun but preceding a demonstrative or
numeral. Semantically, however, it functions differently from the other noun phrase
clitics in that it does not code number or gender and functions as a case marker covering
a variety of meanings, the most common being locative (LOC) or instrumental (INS).
Examples (230) to (233) illustrate the locative use.

"5021As noted above, some of the relational nouns and some uses of other relational
nouns might be analyzed as postpositions. For one thing, they often signal a semantic
relationship between a noun phrase and a verb (or noun), like adpositions in other
languages, rather than denoting something the way noun phrases normally do. This is
especially true for some relational nouns, like kana 'with' and yungu 'like'.
Although relational nouns do not occur with noun phrase clitics when they are
functioning as adjuncts of the verb, they do occur with noun phrase clitics when they
function as part of a noun phrase. In (288), for example, the masculine noun phrase
clitic =r occurs on kana, but in this case lam kana 'with spines' is modifying the noun
kufu 'vine' and the noun phrase clitic occurs on kana only because kana is the last word
in the entire noun phrase kufu lam kana. That is, it is not marking the relational noun
phrase lam kana but rather the entire noun phrase kufu lam kana 'a vine with spines'.
(288) kufu lam kana=r
vine spine with=M

but contains three constituents, the determiner di, the demonstrative ora and the
relational noun phrase lam fringi kana 'with long spines'.",[194]

In asymmetrical compounds, both nouns have the same primary stress typically
associated with that noun, but the stress on the first noun will be somewhat reduced
and the stress on the second noun will be somewhat enhanced. That is, differences in
stress can help determine whether two nouns are in a compound relationship, or
whether they are separate noun phrases. In the case of separate noun phrases, both
nouns will have the same relative stress level. Furthermore, in a compound, only one
clitic will be present.
5.11.2 Symmetrical Compounds
In the compounds discussed in the last section, there is an asymmetric relationship
between the two nouns in that one noun is more head-like while the other is more like a
modifier. But there are also symmetrical compounds, where the two nouns play the
same role in the compound, where the meaning is similar to conjunction. There is a
difference in stress between these compounds and the asymmetric compounds .
Namely, in these symmetric compounds, both nouns carry an equal primary stress.
These symmetric compounds behave like single nouns, rather than conjoined noun
phrases, in that they occur with a single noun phrase clitic. In (319) and (320), the two188nouns are both kin terms and the compound denotes the pair of individuals, treating
them as a group.

nanda=fun=ka
7037

older.sister-3DU=INT

Note that the number of the clitic is only appropriate for the totality of the nouns
taken in conjunction: in both (319) and (320), the clitic is dual, although in (319) it is a
noun phrase clitic, while in (320) it is a predicate clitic.
5.11.3 Animals and Plant Names
Animal and plant names are a type of asymmetrical compound, but they are worth
separting them out since unlike most asymmetical compounds the head of the
compound is the first noun rather than the second one. That is, the type of animal or
plant is the first noun and the second noun is the sub-type of the first. This system of
naming is not unlike the Linnaean classification system in Western biology, where the
more generic genus name precedes the specific species name. There is a limited set of
classificatory categories which are all common nouns and can also be used as generic
terms for the entire class of individual species within a class. Table 36 lists all these
category names for plants and animals.","[203, 204, 205]"
"202Example (351) shows two occurrences of the determiner di in its less frequent
position following the noun. In both cases, it follows an adjective, but the two
occurrences differ in that in the first instance, there are two noun phrase clitics in the
noun phrase, one on the adjective samba 'big', the other on the determiner, while in the
second instance, there is only one occurrence, on the determiner.

Example (352) illustrates a postnominal relational noun phrase modifying a noun.
The fact that the relational noun phrase is followed by a noun phrase clitic shows that
such relational noun phrases behave like adjectives and possessive pronouns and unlike
demonstratives and numerals in preceding the noun phrase clitic.

an English name, Pidgin name (after the source language, Tok Pisin), or Christian name.
These names are all typical English names which have been incorporated due to
extensive contact with the West over the last 100 years (and perhaps the difficulty of
foreigners in pronouncing native names).
9.7.2 Bad Name sir kaha
The most commonly used form after the given name is the sir kaha which means
'bad name'. The name itself does not have negative connotations, nor is it considered
rude to use the name. The name is considered โbadโ because it is used when the
speaker believes that the addressee has behaved badly. Its use reflects the fact that its
owner has violated some social convention. The choice to use the sir kaha is a reflection
of the speakerโs attitude toward the addressee. Typically, however, the speaker will not
be angry with the addressee, but will be using this variant to help enforce some social
norm which the addressee has violated. In some contexts, the sir kaha is similar to
nicknames in the English speaking world and can similarly be used affectionately (akin to
calling friends by names that highlight negative personal qualities). The sir kaha is still392used widely by most speakers and most speakers will know the kaha form of most given
names, whether or not they know someone who has that name (this is not the case with
the other name variants, see ยง9.7.3 - ยง9.7.5).
The most common usage of the sir kaha is by parents towards their children. As
children age, the likelihood that they will be addressed by their sir kaha is lessened. The
purpose of the sir kaha, the speakers say, is to โspoil the nameโ of someone when they
have done something wrong. When the ordinary given name consists of morphemes,
the typical method of forming the sir kaha is to replace one of the morphemes of the
given name with a different morpheme. This has the effect of changing or altogether
removing the meaning of that personโs name. For any given name, there is a unique sir
kaha. Therefore, all people with the same given name will always be addressed by the
same variant form in the sir kaha.
There are a couple of less formal ways to form the sir kaha of a name. One is to
simply shorten the name by replacing the second morpheme of the name with /ks/,
which has the sense of friendly ribbing. Example (46) gives two examples of this.
(46) nanda timba becomes nandeks
'older.brother not.have'solaku becomes solaks
(no meaning)A more affectionate shortening of the name involves dropping final syllable(s) and
stretching out the remaining final vowel. In the case of final /u/, this often transitions to
/i/ as in the second example in (47).","[407, 408, 409]"

The only unique imperative forms are those for first person. The third person forms
are identical to the third person demonstrative pronouns (see ยง5.4.6) while the forms
for second person are identical with the second person subject pronouns. Verbal
marking for imperative mood is accomplished by use of a bare verb stem, and the use of
an imperative pronoun together with the verb stem is otherwise the only way to
indicate a command. For second person commands, the dual and plural pronouns are116obligatory with the bare verb, while the second person singular pronoun is optional.

"9.12 Tok Pisin
Due to the widespread use of Tok Pisin as a medium of communication (see ยง1.1),
most people freely mix Tok Pisin words into their Mehek speech. In fact, they are often
unaware that they have done so if it is pointed out. One salient example of this
unawareness of the intrusion of Tok Pisin words is the word kawil. This was given as the
name for a cross-section of a particular type of bamboo that is hollow but has spoke-like
supports which children often play with. It follows the sound patterns of Mehek and
could very easily be a native Mehek word. At a later point, however, it became clear404that it was not a Mehek word, but rather the Tok Pisin ka wil 'car wheel'. Upon extensive
questioning, speakers did acknowledge that it was Tok Pisin, though they had at first
insisted that it was indeed a Mehek word.
Children under the age of 18 or so are particularly apt to not only incorporate Tok
Pisin extensively, but to speak it almost exclusively. Most people in this age group
understand Mehek to varying degrees of proficiency, but for the most part do not speak
Mehek actively. There are exceptions to this generalization of course, but most young
people are most comfortable with Tok Pisin. This is the language of all school instruction
above the primary level (about third grade) and the language used to communicate with
all people who are not from the Mehek-speaking villages. There is frequent contact with
the Eho-speaking villagers just south of Wilwil (the southernmost non-Kafle village).
Also, women who marry into the Mehek-speaking community from outside villages
initially communicate in Tok Pisin, but typically learn Mehek to some extent. However,
due to the widespread use of Tok Pisin, it is increasingly uncommon for women who
marry in to learn to speak Mehek with any degree of proficiency. Some topics are nearly
always discussed in Tok Pisin. These include politics and religion in particular, though
many topics are discussed in Tok Pisin intermittently. Topics dealing with traditional
village life are mostly discussed in Mehek, including planting, hunting, village gossip, and
family matters. Tok Pisin words and phrases frequently enter Mehek conversations and
most speakers, when asked about this, think it is a bad thing. However, every speaker
does use at least some Tok Pisin words in their speech. When children are present, a
405primarily Mehek conversation will proceed, but when the children are addressed
directly or when their understanding is particularly desired, they will be addressed (and
respond) in Tok Pisin. In these cases, people initially make a statement in Mehek and
then repeat it in Tok Pisin. If these trends continue, it is likely that Mehek will cease to
be the primary means of communication within two generations. Below are some of the
main ways that Tok Pisin interacts with Mehek in daily conversation.
9.12.1 Borrowings and Translations
There are two broad categories of Tok Pisin borrowings: those that are for words or
concepts that pertain to Western goods and culture and therefore do not have a Mehek
equivalent; and those which do have a Mehek equivalent, but are very commonly used
in Tok Pisin and are either more succinct than the Mehek equivalent, or are perceived as
preferable for some reason. Especially with the latter group of words, speakers will be
more aware that these words come from Tok Pisin and will sometimes express
embarrassment about using them while speaking Mehek. As for the first group, there
are some words for Western goods and culture which have been created, calqued, or
borrowed into Mehek and which are perceived as Mehek words. Table 54 gives a list of
the most common Tok Pisin borrowings for which there is no Mehek equivalent. Of note
is the word for 'clan'. The Mehek kinship system does involve a clan structure (see
ยง2.3.3), but there does not seem to be a word meaning 'clan'. The word sambo is406sometimes used, but it refers to the garamut beat (see ยง9.10) pertaining to a person or
clan.

On the other hand, many Tok Pisin nouns are adopted despite the fact that there
are already Mehek words for those concepts. One reason for this is that Mehek makes
many finer distinctions in meaning where the Tok Pisin has a more general word. As an
example, the Tok Pisin word kari (from English 'carry') means more or less the same as
its English equivalent. However, in Mehek it is not possible to refer to carrying without
specifying the type and manner of carrying from ten different verbs. A different
situation arises in the case of the numerals. Tok Pisin numerals come from English and
are phonetically quite similar to the English. Mehek, however has a restricted counting
system with poly-syllabic numerals. Many speakers have difficulty even remembering
the numerals above five. In the past, this was not an issue, as counting was not an
important skill. But with the intrusion of Western culture and money, it is often407necessary to refer to specific and large numbers. The Mehek system allows for counting
up to approximately 24, but is not easy or practical to use. In practice, numbers above
ten are not useful at all.
Tok Pisin is so widely used even by proficient Mehek speakers that it is often simply
easier to choose a word from Tok Pisin despite the Mehek equivalent being equally
prominent. Table 55 lists the most commonly used Tok Pisin exemplars of this type.

With a minority of animal and plant names, the head comes second. For example,
the compound won gulma 'Won mantis', illustrated in (324) is an exception to the
general pattern whereby the head is first; in this case the second noun gulma 'mantis,
grasshopper' is the head.

plant names in which the head comes second are ones where the modifer is a
description of where the animal or plant can be found rather than simply a word for the
particular species. Example of this include aka samdo 'house spider' and wuwr gulma
'cane grass grasshopper'. In aka samdo 'house spider', the modifier is the noun for
'house' while in wuwr gulma 'cane grass grasshopper', the modifier is the name for a
type of cane grass.
In addition to these compounds, there are some species which do not have a
compound name and can only be referred to by a single noun. Due to language loss, the
less common species names are being lost by younger speakers, though older speakers
191still know them. The generic category terms are also widely used when specificity is not
called for or when the specific type was not known. For example, if a bird called out,
most speakers would know the specific name by the birdโs call and would refer to it by
its species-specific name. However, if someone was going hunting for birds, the
category name would be used, unless only one species of bird was sought.
5.11.4 Series Compounds
In addition to noun-noun compounds, groups of nouns consisting of more than two
nouns listed in series can also be a compound, as in (325) and (326).

These compounds are simply more general instances of the symmetric compounds
discussed above in that they have semantics that is more like conjunction. These series
compounds are still treated syntactically as a unit and can only host one noun phrase

In series compounds (mentioned in the preceding section), several nouns will be
juxtaposed and treated as a single syntactic entity. The series of nouns is a simple list (as192above)and will take dual or plural agreement as appropriate. There are also complex
compounds consisting of more than two nouns, which have a hierarchical structure in
that they can be broken down into parts, some of these parts being themselves
compounds, similar to English Boston baked beans, which consists of the noun Boston
plus the compound baked beans. With compounds consisting of three words, there are
in fact two possible constituent structures. One possibility is that the first two nouns
form a compound which together modify the final noun in the structure (NN)N. This is
illustrated in (327). In this case, mundu 'centipede' and bi 'tooth' combine in a
asymmetrical compound with bi 'tooth' as head (since mundu bi is a type of tooth), and
this compound in turn combines with siki 'hole' to form a second asymmetrical
compound with siki 'hole' as head (since the whole compound denotes a kind of hole).
(327) mundu
bi
siki=k
5062
centipede tooth hole=LOC
in the hole [made by] the centipedeโs tooth.
It is also possible for the final two nouns to form a compound which together combine
with the first noun in the structure N(NN). This is illustrated by fer ama yirkwe 'pig
bamboo knife' in (328).
(328) fer kefu=r
ra-wa-m
fer ama
yirkwe mu
pig blood=M get-PAST1-3PL pig bamboo knife
3PL
They got the pig blood and the bamboo knife for killing pigs.ra=ka 6040
get=REALNote that regardless of the constituent structure, the compound conforms to the
general principle that the modifier occurs first and the head second. In (328), fer ama193yirkwe 'pig bamboo knife' denotes a type of bamboo knife and the compound ama
yirkwe 'bamboo knife' denotes a kind of knife.
It is also possible for the embedded compound to be a symmetrical compound. For
example, in (329), the compound afa nanda wur, literally 'father older-brother stoneaxe' but meaning 'ancestor stone-axes', the first two words afa nanda, literally 'father
older-brother' is a symmetrical compound meaning 'ancestor' that in turn modifies wur
'stone axe' in an asymmetrical compound.
(329) afa
nanda
wur
father older.brother
stone.axe
ancestors stone axes from long ago[mele kusa]
[long.ago]fenda=r
from=M6097The opposite situation is also possible: one can have a complex compound where the
component parts combine together in a symmetric compound. Example (330) illustrates
this possibility, where the the component parts are suwa fringi 'leg long' and lesu fringi
'arm long' and they combine together symmetrically to denote someone with long legs
and long arms. Again, note the single noun phrase clitic at the end of the entire
sequence, showing how the entire sequence behaves like a noun.

fringi=r

long-leg and long-arm person5084With all types of compounds, the whole compound behaves like a noun in that one
gets a single noun phrase clitic at the end of the entire sequence, as in (330). Note that
the number of the noun phrase clitic can be singular or dual or plural depending on the
194semantics of the compound. For example in (330) above, the compound is followed by a
singular clitic since although the set of long arms and long legs is plural, the compound
denotes (or can denote) a single person with long arms and long legs. Contrast this with
(331), where the compounds ari yoko 'bottom side' and kondu yoku 'top side' occur with
dual clitics because they each denote pairs of teeth.

uses, biki is used with humans or nonhumans and bu with nonhumans. The word biki is

other interrogative expressions (ยง7.7.4). The indefinite adnominal use with humans is

5.4.8 Reflexive kuna
The reflexive word kuna has two uses. The first use is the one most commonly

analysis of (125) might be something like 'I cut myself on the hand'. However, this is not a possible
analysis for (127).","[155, 156, 157]"

Demonstratives make a three-way distance distinction, though it is one that is
roughly based on person rather than distance per se, since they corresond to first,
second, and third person. The three types are proximal (close to the speaker), distal
(close to addressee, but away from speaker) and remote (far from both speaker and
addressee). The proximal and distal demonstratives are formed by combining a
demonstrative stem, ke- in the case of the proximal, o- in the case of the distal, with a
suffix coding number/gender/diminutiveness. These suffixes are identical in form to the
corresponding noun phrase clitics. The remote demonstrative is really a combination of
the distal demonstrative with the word yal (examples (102) and (103) below illustrate
this word). The proximal and distal demonstratives are listed in Table 30.","[142, 143]"

Onomatopoeia is not a common process in the language at large; however, a

the animal names known to have an onomatopoeic component.

That is, these are the names that speakers will repeat in the tone of the call that the
animal makes. There are likely other names which have onomatopoeic components
which are no longer consciously known to speakers (particularly reduplicative names
that consist of words that are otherwise not found as independent morphemes). The
only non-name words that are known to have an onomatopoeic element are yo 'a sound
made while calling another' and kra 'cry'.
Sound symbolism is also not a productive system, though there a few words where
one of the vowels can vary in relationship to the size of the object being described. In
these cases, the smaller size is associated with a high vowel and the larger size is
77associated with a (relatively) lower vowel. The known examples are given in examples
(20-22).

4.0 Introduction
The purpose of this short chapter is to provide a general overview of some aspects
of the grammatical system of Mehek. In ยง4.1, I summarize the morphology, primarily
the morphology of verbs, while in ยง4.2, I discuss one of the more unusual features of
Mehek, a set of noun phrase clitics that code the number and gender of noun phrases,
plus a similar set of predicate clitics which appear on nonverbal predicates.","[92, 93, 94, 95]"

Table 16: Orthographic Consonants75The conventions of note for the consonants include the voiced stops. When wordinitial, they are very often not pre-nasalized and therefore are spelled with the single
stop symbol (b, d, g). However, in any word-medial position, particularly following a
vowel, the nasalization is quite apparent. Therefore, in those cases the digraphic form is
used (mb, nd, ng). An additional reason for this is that the speakers themselves prefer
this dual convention. When literate speakers write Mehek, they do not write nasals
word-initially and do (sometimes) write them word-medially. It is thought best to
respect this native-speaker judgment. An exception to the rule about medial position is
when a stop consonant is preceded by another consonant rather than a vowel, or is
preceded by a different nasal. In these cases, the prenasalization is minimal or nonexistent. The examples in (16) and (17) show an example of each of these cases.

/alลgan/
'fly'(17) [weinbeni]
/weinmbeni/
'limbum bark variety'In words where /m/+/r/ occurs word-medially (i.e. with a following vowel), there is
often an epenthetic [b] pronounced between them. The most salient examples of this
include the personal pronouns with emphatic ra (see ยง5.4.5) and the distal
demonstrative pronouns (see ยง5.4.6). These are shown in examples (18) and (19). In
these cases, because the [b] is a predictable phonetic variant, it is omitted
orthographically.","[90, 91, 92]"

dependency status of the second clause to the first. (This is real-world, rather than
grammatical dependency.) The first type listed, conjunction, merely requires the
juxtaposition of the two clauses and no further ordering or dependency is implied
(though these may both be implied by context). Going down the list, the different clause
types impose restrictions, first on the temporal relationship, then on the dependency
status of the second clause. The final type listed, conditional, requires not only a
temporal sequence and a dependency relationship, but the further requirement that the
first clause itself may not actually occur.
The syntax for the clausal particles yombo 'simultaneous', yungu 'dependent', and
rokor 'causal' relationships is similar. Unlike the verbal aspectual particles (ยง7.2), these
particles are not affixes, but are instead separate words with their own stress and (in
some cases), capable of taking their own agreement markers. As for the syntax of the
clauses themselves, in the default, unmarked context, they each require the verb
immediately preceding to have no inflection and to end in the gerundial suffix โm (see
ยง8.3.3). It is also possible for the preceding verb to have no inflection when imperative,
as well as the conditional marker if the speaker wishes to emphasize that the action has
not yet happened. The syntax of the two clauses linked by a particle is the same in the
case of all three. These cases are summarized in Table 48 below. The abbreviations used
include V for verb and INFL for full verbal inflection.","[357, 358]"
"118There are also two imperative suffixes on verbs, -tn and -ta, discussed in ยง6.5.
5.4.4 Possessive Pronouns
The possessive pronouns are formed by combining a possessive prefix with the
stem -ko ~ go. This is the only morpheme in Mehek that occurs with prefixes. The forms
of the possessive pronouns are given in Table 26.
DualPlural1Singular
ongo ~ godungonumgo2nokofungokumgo3Mroko33FsokofokomokoTable 26: Possessive Pronouns

wasuwarme=3SG.M
His name is Wasuwarme. [It is his name. It is Wasuwarme.]
Examples (54) and (55) illustrate the first and second person dual possessive pronouns,
where the form of the possessive stem is -go rather than -ko, since the prefix in both
cases ends in a nasal consonant.

possessive pronoun roko occurs with the 3M.SG noun phrase clitic =r. This form resembles a monomorphemic word rokor which is a causal marker and frequently occurs at the end of clauses (see ยง8.2.3).","[134, 135]"
"8Descriptions โ Once the domains of plants and animals seemed to be fully covered,
verbal descriptions of each plant and animal were recorded. These recordings included
descriptions of physical characteristics, locations where they could be found, and uses
employed by the community.
Stories and myths โ These include traditional tales, histories of clans and individual
people, family histories, explanations about why the world is the way it is, and
explanations of processes, such as scraping sago and house construction.
Written material โ Very little native-produced written material was gathered,
though some speakers did write short stories or letters for me. The knowledge of
writing in Tok Pisin was applied to Mehek and was often very similar to the orthography
that I had developed. In addition, some basic educational materials had been created by
local primary school teachers and these were shared with me.
Natural speech โ by this is meant speech which was spoken in my presence or
overheard. These often provided excellent insights into the way the language is actually
used and also provided examples of things never encountered in any of the above
settings. There were at least a dozen instances of natural speech (often a single word or
phrase) that provided the impetus for further documentation. In nearly every case,
follow-up yielded fruitful results.
All of the collected data were either written directly in a notebook from the elicited
speech or audio-recorded. The recordings were made with a Tascam DR-07 Portable9Digital Recorder. Several brief videos were also recorded. In every case, each recording
was later transcribed by me with the help of a consultant (the one who originally made
the recording when possible). All of these data were typed and entered into a database
of materials. The database contains approximately 105,000 words or 225 pages of
single-spaced text. This includes the notebooks and other notes I wroted in the field.
The total of distinct entries in the dictionary is just over 3200 words. All consultants gave
their permission for their speech to be used in whatever manner is appropriate for the
preservation of the Mehek language. It is my ultimate goal to present a basic grammar,
full dictionary, collection of stories, and, possibly, basic educational materials to the
Mehek speakers as a gift for their generosity in spending time assisting in this work.","[24, 25, 26]"
"393(47) anele becomes ane

'heart bad'9.7.3 Good Name sir nalingi
A lesser used, but still very prominent name variant is the sir nalingi. The word
nalingi by itself does not have a meaning, but it is related to the verb nali 'smile, laugh'.
This is appropriate as the sir nalingi is always used in situations of happiness and joy. An
appropriate translation of nalingi would be โgood nameโ, as it shows it in
contradistinction to the sir kaha, in both meaning and usage. Just as is the case with the
sir kaha, the use of this form is an expression of the speakerโs attitude towards the
addressee. The form of the sir nalingi is also a unique form that is associated with a
particular given name. Any speakers with a particular given name will have the same
nalingi. There are fewer distinct forms of the nalingi than there are sir kaha forms; there
are several instances in which an entire set of given names share the same nalingi. The
nalingi is primarily used in greetings and when the addressee has said or done
something praiseworthy or pleasing to the speaker. The nalingi is not used for most dayto-day greetings, but rather when the addressee has been gone for some time.
9.7.4 Name Whistle isi
There is a whistle associated with every name, called the isi. Because the isi is still
so widely used, most forms are still well-known to most speakers. Other than very small
children, all speakers know the isi for their own name. Almost without exception, every
name has its own unique whistle, though there are a few names that do share a single394whistle call. The whistling is, in contrast to most other instances of whistle languages
reported, restricted almost entirely to the domain of names (Busnel and Classe 1996).
The speakers report that they are the only group they know of to use such whistles to
communicate, though other forms of spoken communication are common over long
distances in other areas. Many cases of whistle languages have been reported to be
restricted mainly or exclusively to the men in the community (Cowan 1948), but the isi
has no such restriction; women were observed to use it just as frequently as men and
with no reservations in doing so. A list of names and their accompanying whistles can be
found in Appendix H.
9.7.5 The Name Song hokwa
There is finally a hokwa, or name song, that is a short melody that, like the other
above-mentioned types of names, are associated with every given name. Each given
name has its own unique hokwa. This is a phenomenon which is not completely
unknown in Papua New Guinea (Niles 1992). As with the isi, however, there are a few
hokwa that are associated with more than one name. Each hokwa melody is short,
between four and 15 seconds. It will not be sung for common, day-to-day greetings, but
on special occasions and after long absences. The use of the hokwa is typically
associated with one of two taps, the mambunge fu or 'forehead tap' and the taku tongo
or 'chin slap', which are performed on the person to whom the hokwa is sung by the
singer. These are performed lightly, with about the same amount of pressure as when395applauding. The forehead tap is done with the side of the hand (with fingers extended)
in the middle of the forehead and the chin slap is performed with a grasping motion on
the underside of the chin. Each of these is usually done two to five times in quick
succession after which the other is performed. The hokwa is not used outside of the
conventionalized greeting scenario . The hokwa is the least used of the name variants
nowadays (as opposed to the isi and sir kaha) and consequently is being lost the most
quickly amongst most speakers. A list of names and their accompanying songs can be
found in Appendix H.","[409, 410, 411, 412]"

+ (noun phrase clitic) + (Dem/[Num + noun phrase clitic])The formula in (345) does not include relative clauses (see ยง5.9), which always precede
the noun, or relational noun phrase modifiers of nouns, which either precede or follow
the noun (see below) or adnominal interrogative words; it is not clear how these are
ordered with respect to other modifiers of nouns. All of the constituents in (345) are
optional since one can have noun phrases consisting only of nouns and noun phrases
lacking nouns. Where possibilities are indicated as alternatives, namely with8The formula in (345) and the labels on examples below use the following abbreviation:

The fact that gwasi 'pepper' is the head is also clear in this case because manbo gwasi is

There are exceptions to the normal compound order. In duwan nawa 'a large type
of basket' in (316), the head of the compound is the first noun duwan 'basket' while the
second word nawa 'mother' specifies a sub-type, the larger basket used by adults.

The second element of the compound can also metonymically stand in for action
accomplished with that noun. The most common usage in this respect is with lesu
'hand'. Here, the hand is meant to signify the action done by hand, specifically, planting,
as illustrated in (317). In these cases, the second noun is indeed a noun and not a verb,
in that it is ungrammatical to use verbal morphology with the noun of the implied
action, as illustrated in (318).","[202, 203]"

This alternation between diminutive and masculine or feminine can reflect a shifting
focus on the properties of the referent of the noun phrase as perceived by the speaker,
vis. the size or affection towards the object.
There are a few places in Mehek grammar where there is either no possibility of a
diminutive value or the diminutive form is rarely used, although coding of
person/number/gender is possible. One situation where there is no possibility of a
diminutive value is in the possessive pronouns (ยง5.4.4), where one must code the
possessor as masculine or feminine. A similar situation arises with the object form of
personal pronouns (ยง5.4.2). There is again no diminutive form, though curiously the
form of the feminine object pronoun is te, the form we would expect if there were a
diminutive object pronoun, rather than what would be the expected form se (which
does not exist). With the subject form of personal pronouns, there is a diminutive form
tu, but it is rarely used.
Within a text, it is possible for a given referent to be treated as masculine or
feminine part of the time but as diminutive part of the time. For example, the text in
Appendix 1 (Text A.1), there are two women, both wives of the male character in the105text. The first wife is treated as feminine in sentence (4) and continues as such until
sentence (28), where she is treated as diminutive, though this occurs in a direct
quotation by the husband. And in sentence (30), she is treated as feminine, though this
too occurs in a direct quotation, but by the second wife. In sentence (33), she is treated
as diminutive but although this is not a direct quotation, the sentence is saying that the
husband feels bad for her, so the choice of diminutive may reflect the husbandโs
feelings. In sentences (36) and (37) and subsequent sentences, she is again treated as
feminine. The second wife is initially treated as diminutive in sentence (5). However, in
subsequent sentences she is treated as feminine.
It is possible to have alternations between diminutive and feminine or masculine
gender or plural number for the same referent within the same sentence. In (15), the
subject aye barmbar has a coreferential feminine pronoun su following it, but the two
predicates of this clause, kandat 'thin' and kaiembot 'small' both bear diminutive
predicate clitics (and the verbs of the next two clauses, both suknat 'sleep', also bear
diminutive inflection). However, this could be attributed to the fact that the diminutive
subject pronoun tu is rarely used.

106A similar example is given in (16), where the mosquito is treated as diminutive in
the first clause, both by the noun phrase clitic on fit 'mosquito' and the predicate clitic
on ata 'very', while in the next clause the possessive form is sokom, which now treats
the mosquito as feminine. However, this can be explained by the lack of a possessive
pronoun indicating a diminutive possessor.

Another example of this is given in (17). The noun phrase naku walo 'walo sago' is the
possessor of kulka 'leaf' and the possessive pronoun sokot bears feminine inflection for
the possessor, while in the clause at the end, it is treated as diminutive, as illustrated by
the diminutive predicate clitic on kufet 'good'.

might expect the resulting noun phrase to be plural, but instead we get diminutive
predicate clitics on the three predicate adjectives.","[120, 121, 122, 123]"
"135ni-m-s
see6055While one might not analyze the demonstrative system as a three-way contrast, since
the remote form combines with the distal and does not itself inflect, one reason for
analyzing it this way is that demonstrative adverbs more clearly illustrate the same
three-way contrast, as discussed in ยง7.3.2.2.
5.4.7 Interrogative/Indefinite Pronouns
There are two words that function either as interrogative pronouns or as indefinite
pronouns, namely em 'who, someone' and bu 'what, something', shown in Table 32.
Interrogative words will be described as a group in ยง7.7.4. I treat the final consonants
that occur in the singular, dual and plural forms as instances of noun phrase clitics.

"153The numeral system is a base-five system in that expressions of meanings like 'six'
take the form 'five plus one' and meanings like 'eleven' take the form 'five plus five plus
one'. The counting system of Mehek can be extended up to 20, though in practice it is
typically limited to counting objects ten and below. The pattern for numerals five and
above is shown in Table 34.

Following the pattern of morphological combinations does yield numerals above
ten, though they become quite unwieldy and difficult to produce on the fly. In practice,
Tok Pisin numerals are used for numbers above about five. To create numbers five and
above, the forms become structurally complex and are partially based on body part
terms. These kinds of restricted counting systems are quite common throughout Papua
New Guinea. The numeral for 'five' has two variant forms that are composites of lesu
'hand', dambe 'fruit species', butu 'put hands together' and the relational noun yoko
(see ยง5.10.2). Both include the morpheme for 'hand', lesu. To generate the numerals
fifteen and above, a new form is introduced modeled on the word for 'five', but
154replacing lesu with the word for 'foot', suwa. This gives it a meaning something like 'foot
fist'. The form for 'twenty' already includes two instances each of words which refer to
hands and feet and so this is the limit of the system. Example (179) gives an example of
a numeral for 'five' in use.

"1.1 The Linguistic Scene and Language Vitality
Papua New Guinea is the most linguistically diverse country in the world (Gordon
2005). There are more than 800 languages spoken in the country, and more than 1000
spoken on the island of New Guinea. These languages are still not well documented and
language family groupings are often tenuous and disputed. The primary linguistic
grouping in Papua New Guinea is the โTrans-New Guineaโ language family, which
contains almost 500 languages. With more documentation, many smaller family
groupings have been established, though these are often uncertain as well. The Sepik
family to which Mehek belongs is one of these smaller families.
Languages of Papua New Guinea have some broad features in common, many of
which Mehek shares. These shared features include: a relatively simple phonological
system; verb-final word order, typically SOV; complex, agglutinative verbal morphology2(though Mehek verbal morphology is not overly complex); and the morphology of other
word classes is usually simpler. Beyond these generalizations, it is difficult to otherwise
group all (or even most) languages of Papua New Guinea based on any specific criteria.
The origin of the name of the Mehek language is unknown, though it does follow
the naming pattern of many other languages in the immediate geographical area, up to
the Torricelli Mountain Range. This is a practice of the Lumi District administration
wherein languages are named after their word for 'no'. (Laycock 1968) The name is
sometimes pronounced without the /h/ or instead with a glottal stop [mษษk] or [mษษษk].
In careful speech, it is sometimes pronounced with both, [mษhษษษk]. The people, for the
most part, adhere to this practice and call their own language Mehek or Mehek Suma
'Mehek Language'. According to Ethnologue (Gordon 2005), it is also known as
Indinogosima, Driafleisuma and Nuku. The former two names have been attested from
some speakers. Suma is a word meaning 'voice' and the words indi numgo are a
demonstrative and possessive pronoun meaning 'our'. The term driaflei is an erroneous
rendition of dinafle, 'one'. Naming the language Nuku, after the most prominent village
where it is spoken, is another common naming practice in the area, though typical of
languages that are only spoken in one village (Laycock 1968). This is an exonym rather
than a term the speakers use for their own language.
The language is currently still used on a daily basis by most of the adult speakers.
Their attitudes towards the language are good, though it is only irregularly transmitted3to children. Despite this, most children primarily have a passive understanding of the
language and do not actively use it except in limited form with adults. Amongst each
other, children (roughly, those under the age of about 20), speak Tok Pisin almost
exclusively. See ยง2.4.3 for more information on intergenerational transmission.
Tok Pisin is a creole language spoken by most people within Papua New Guinea. Its
lexifier language is primarily English, though many core vocabulary items come from
nearby Melanesian languages (primarily Malay and Tolai) as well as German. Tok Pisin is
spoken by all but the most elderly and English is spoken only by those who have had
schooling beyond the sixth grade. Children (ages approximately <14) do not have as
great a command of Mehek as do adults, particularly in the lexical domain. They do not
speak it as often or as readily as adults, though they do understand it and can respond
to basic utterances. The use of Tok Pisin in the schools is likely the reason that children
use Tok Pisin in more situations than adults. Because children seem to be using Tok Pisin
more than Mehek, the youngest generation will likely speak Tok Pisin to their children
even more than their parents currently do. This may lead to the decline in the vitality of
Mehek in the coming generations. See ยง9.12 for more information on the influence of
Tok Pisin on Mehek.","[18, 19, 20]"

Table 53: Mehek Deaf Signs403The basic word order of Mehek sign language follows that of spoken Mehek, i.e.
SOV. This must be obeyed as there are not any grammatical signs to connect each sign
to its grammatical role. Often, there is a preparatory clause which sets the stage for the
specific clause which is to follow. For example, to express the concept: โa man and
woman foughtโ, there would be an introductory clause showing the relative heights of
the participants. A flat hand parallel to the ground would be held low, then higher to
show the heights of the participants. This is a standardized way to indicate a woman and
a man. Following that, the signs for man, woman, and fight in that order would be given
to give the specifics of the encounter. The very same introductory clause could also
serve to precede โa child and her mother went to the gardenโ. In that case, the signs
that would follow would be: child, mother, garden, go. No sign for possession is used.","[418, 419, 420]"

Nominal possession can involve embedded possession, when the possessor is itself
possessed. The resultant noun phrases involve two possessive pronouns, one within the
possessor noun phrase, the other accompanying the higher possessed noun. For
example, in (208), the possessive pronoun numgo modifies the noun maure 'ancestor'
and bears the noun phrase clitic =s for the noun phrase maure numgo 'our ancestor',
160but this noun phrase is itself the possessor of hokwa 'song' and the possessive pronoun
sokora (the emphatic form of soko) follows the common pattern of a possessive

The next set of examples illustrate multiple modifiers preceding a noun. The part of
the formula in (345) that describes the prenominal modifiers as
'(Det/Dem/Poss/Num/PossNP)' is so formulated because I do not have much data on
which prenominal modifiers can co-coccur if they can, what their relative order is. The
only thing that is clear is that the determiner and possessive pronoun can co-occur and
when they do, the determiner precedes the possessive pronoun. Both (354) and (355)
illustrate this, differing only in that (348) also includes a postnominal adjective.

There are two verbs in Mehek which serve in a role of โlight verbsโ. They are full
verbs capable of serving as the main verb in a clause and taking the full range of verbal
markings, including tense, aspect, and person. They also occur as tenseless verbs in
clauses which require them. What sets them apart from other verbs is the following:
they are most frequently employed in combination with another verb; they have
relatively general meanings which can cover a broad range of cases; and they occur
quite frequently. Because of their frequency, these verbs are the most common verbs in
Mehek. The two verbs are eku 'do' and rete 'put', discussed in ยง7.10.1 and ยง7.10.2
respectively.
7.10.1 eku 'do'
The verb eku can be used as a main verb meaning 'do, make', as in (388) and (389).

Though less common (due to the ease of simply incorporating Tok Pisin words),
Mehek speakers often use Mehek words or expressions for meanings associated with
western culture and hence meanings not expressed in traditional Mehek, especially by
metaphorical extension of Mehek words. There are not many common examples, and
even those listed in Table 59 are often simply replaced with the Tok Pisin equivalent.

an appropriate Mehek equivalent for a Tok Pisin concept to avoid having too many Tok
Pisin words in their speech. This appears to be mainly because they are making a
conscious effort to preserve Mehek language and culture.
9.12.2 Code Switching
In addition to the single lexical items that frequently make their way into speech,
there are many instances where grammatical particles from Mehek make their way into
speech that is primarily Tok Pisin, or where Mehek verbs head phrases which are
otherwise completely Tok Pisin. Most of the time, a given conversation will take place
mostly in Mehek, with occasional Tok Pisin lexical items sprinkled throughout. The
reverse is less common, but does occur, particularly with cultural items or practices
which Tok Pisin does not have a word for or has a cumbersome phrase rather than a
single lexical item. Code switching, by distinction, is when grammatical elements from
one language interact with the other. This mostly happens with verbs and also
sometimes discourse particles, such as klei. In the case of verbs, if the utterance is
primarily Mehek, the Tok Pisin verb will occur at the end of the clause as required by
Mehek grammar, despite the fact that Tok Pisin constituent order is usually SVO.
However, the reverse does not hold. When an utterance is primarily Tok Pisin, the
Mehek verb, which will take the appropriate tense and person agreement for the clause,412still occurs at the end of the clause. In each of the overheard examples below, the Tok
Pisin word and its gloss are in bold, to simplify the distinction between the two
languages. Examples (48) to (53) are overheard utterances with this kind of code
switching.
(48) hariap

"5.4 Pronouns
There are five sets of personal pronouns, one for subjects, one for objects, one for
possessors and two more specialized sets, one that is used in imperative constructions110and one that is used for emphasis. Pronouns show the same gender and number
distinctions as nouns (see ยง5.1 to ยง5.3): they distinguish singular, dual, and plural
number along with a distinction in the third-person singular only between masculine
and feminine gender and diminutive. Except for the possessive pronouns, the personal
pronouns have unique mono-morphemic forms for each of these distinctions in each
set. The possessive pronouns inflect for the person, gender and number of the
possessor.
Pronouns are used quite frequently and, after something has been introduced in
discourse by a proper or common noun, the noun will often not be repeated again in
the discourse. Even if there are two participants both of the same gender in stories, the
two participants will not be distinguished with nouns and only pronouns will be used. As
most stories are well known to all listeners, it is assumed the listener already
understands who is doing which action and therefore disambiguation is unnecessary.
5.4.1 Subject Pronouns
There is a distinct set of pronouns used for subjects. Table 23 lists all of the subject
pronoun forms.","[126, 127]"
"3.4 Allophones
The following two sections list the allophones of the consonants and vowels along
with their conditioning environments.
603.4.1 Consonants
The phonetic realization of the stop consonants is shown below in Table 5.
Example
[bau]
/bau/
[sumbu] /subu/
[dana]
/dana/
n
[ka da] /kada/
[gome] /gome/
[nuลgul] /nugul/Gloss
'loose'
'follow'
'daybreak'
'thin'
'axe'
'cold'Table 5: Stop Allophones
The pre-nasalized variants of the stops can occur in any environment, though they
are most audible between vowels within a word. They are also quite prominent wordinitially when following a word which ends in a vowel. In these cases, the nasal
component is pronounced as if it is the final consonant of the preceding word, as shown
in example (4).
(4) [sukna ndana] โ /suknan dana/
sleep dawn.break
'sleep until the morning'
Another context which occurs somewhat less frequently is that of a word-final nasal
being followed by a pre-nasalized consonant. In these cases, the phonemic nasal
โoverridesโ the pre-nasal and the latter is not pronounced. Examples (5) and (6) show
this phenomenon.","[76, 77]"
"96Chapter 5: Nouns and Noun Phrases
5.0 Introduction
The primary defining feature of nouns in Mehek is that they possess inherent
gender (ยงsee 5.1). Although nouns frequently occur with noun phrase clitics (ยง4.2), this
is a feature of noun phrases, not nouns. There is no inflectional morphology on nouns.
Because nouns are not obligatory in noun phrases (see ยง5.14), the occurrence with noun
phrase clitics is not a defining characteristic for nouns. The words that are most like
nouns are adjectives. There are a couple of ways in which nouns are different from
adjectives. One is that nouns are associated with gender, while adjectives are not.
Adjectives can take noun phrase clitics, but only if they happen to be the last word in
the noun phrase. A second difference between nouns and adjectives is that if they cooccur in the noun phrase, the noun will always precede the adjective. This chapter does
not discuss noun phrase clitics; these are discussed in ยง4.2.
This chapter considers properties of nouns and the possible constituents of noun
phrases. Sections ยง5.1 to ยง5.3 discuss three variables associated with nouns and noun
phrases: ยง5.1 discusses gender, ยง5.2 discusses the diminutive, and ยง5.3 discusses
number. Most of the remaining sections discuss the various possible constituents of
noun phrases: ยง5.4 discusses the various types of pronouns; ยง5.5 discusses the
indefinite determiner di; ยง5.6 discusses adjectives and adjective phrases; ยง5.7 discusses
numerals; ยง5.8 discusses nominal possession (both pronominal and nominal
possessors); ยง5.9 discusses relative clauses; ยง5.10 discusses relational nouns and the
97locative/instrumental clitic; ยง5.11 discusses compound nouns; ยง5.12 discusses place
names; ยง5.13 discusses conjoined noun phrases; and ยง5.14 discusses the structure of
noun phrases, how the various types of constituents discussed in the preceding sections
combine with each other.","[112, 113, 114]"
"7.6 Passive Clauses
The structure of what I analyze as passive clauses seems, initially, to violate the
rules of verbal agreement in the area of person/number/gender agreement (see ยง6.1).
In all other clauses, the verb agrees with the subject noun phrase. In the passive,
however, it appears either that it is the object which triggers agreement marking on the
verb. However, we can account for this if we analyze such clauses as passive clauses. To
describe the structure of passive clauses and how they differ from corresponding active296clauses, it is useful to use the labels 'A' and 'P' for the arguments that are subject and
object respectively in an active clause. A passive clause is constructed from the
corresponding active clause by three changes: (1) placing the P before the A; (2) using
the subject form for the A, which will always be a pronoun (See ยง5.4); and (3) changing
the agreement on the verb so that it agrees with the P. The difference between passive
and active clauses is schematized in Table 45.

sentences, either in the protasis clause, as in (57) to (61), or the apodosis clause, as in
(62), or in both clauses, as in (63) and (64). It most often occurs without person marking.",[241]
"269In these cases, a more distant location is being made to seem nearer, either in distance,
or in emotional quality, to the listeners. A similar function can be accomplished by
pairing two demonstratives, a proximal and a distal.
7.3.2.3 Temporal Adverbs
There are six adverbs which refer to specific time periods, mostly specific days.

are masculine singular, is judged to allow only one interpretation, one where the first

Subject pronouns are optional, but are in fact often present. In the first thirty
sentences in the text given in story A.1 in Appendix A, there are twelve clauses with
248personal pronouns as subject, one clause with a demonstrative pronoun as subject and
twelve clauses where there is no overt noun phrase functioning as subject. However,
whether a pronoun occurs or not in these thirty sentences is almost entirely predictable
from whether the next verb is finite or not: in most of the examples where the verb is
finite (where the verb codes the person, number and gender of the subject), a subject
pronoun is not used, while in most of the sentences where the verb is nonfinite (the
verb does not bear a subject suffix), the pronoun is used. The examples in (16) and (17)
illustrate the two possibilities. In (16), the verb bears a 3DU subject suffix and there is no
subject pronoun, while in (17), the verb occurs with only the realis clitic and there is a
3DU subject pronoun fu.

gender of the possessee. However, when the possessive pronoun precedes the noun, it
does not occur with a noun phrase clitic, since that clitic always occurs at the end of the

and because the subject suffixes on verbs appear last on the verb, one might be
tempted to analyze the subject suffixes on verbs as instances of the predicate clitics. The
reason I do not do so is that there are some places in the verb morphology where the
tense suffix and the subject suffix fuse together into a single portmanteau morpheme.
Namely, as discussed in ยง6.2.3, the future suffix -ka and the first person singular suffix yun fuse together to form a single morpheme -kun, which refers specifically to future
today, as in (61).

a first person singular subject can be expressed by the suffix -n without a tense suffix
and this form codes both present tense and a first person singular subject and is distinct
from the first person singular predicate clitic =yun. However, apart from these cases, the
subject suffixes on verbs could be analyzed as instances of the predicate clitics.","[111, 112]"

This section lists all the possible consonant sequences in mono-morphemic forms.
Sequences of different vowels do not occur, i.e. two vowels will only occur together in a
mono-morphemic form if they are the same. As mentioned in ยง3.3.1, the two vowels
will often be separated by an epenthetic [h]. Therefore, this section deals only with the
possible combinations of consonants in syllable onsets and codas. Consonant clusters
are never separated by an epenthetic element.
3.7.1 Onset Combinations
The following Table 12 lists the possible onset consonant clusters. The horizontal
row lists the first member of the cluster, and the vertical column gives the second
member. An onset cluster can consist of two or three consonants, with the restrictions
given in the table. For onsets with only a single consonant, any phoneme can occur./b/

-Table 12: Onset Consonant Clusters
There is, in addition to these clusters, a single word which in some dialects of Kafle
is pronounced as /stii/. The word in most other dialects is simply tii 'remove'. This is the68only known example of a word that begins with a cluster including /s/. The first person
singular possessive form /n+go/ (see ยง5.4.4, note 3) also has an underlying initial cluster.
In this case, the cluster is created through a morphological process of prefixing the 1SG
form n to the possessive stem go. However, this is realized phonetically simply as the
normal prenasalized (see ยง3.4.1) velar consonant, /ลgo/, rather than as a sequence of
two consonants.

Codas are limited to two consonants, and only certain consonants can occur in
either position. Only those that can be in a cluster are given in the table. The horizontal
row lists the first member of the cluster, and the vertical column gives the second
member. Coda clusters are almost exclusively the result of morphological processes, so69after each consonant in the first horizontal row, its morphological meaning is given in
parenthesis. The glosses listed are only the primary lexical meaning without taking the
suffix into account. Codas with only a single consonant can consist of any phoneme
except the voiced stops /b/, /d/, and /g/. In addition to the table below, there is a firstperson singular imperative verbal morpheme ('I will do X now') which itself is a
consonant cluster, /tn/ (see ยง6.5). This is shown in example (7).

When two vowels occur in sequence, they will either create a diphthong or will
coalesce. In the case of coalescence, one vowel in a sequence of two is either reduced
or not pronounced at all. Diphthongs occur when a pair of vowels occur within a word
(see ยง3.2.1); a sequence of two different vowels within a word always results in a
diphthong. When two vowels occur across a word boundary, there will often be
coalescence. The general rule is that the second vowel will be realized, while the first
vowel will not be pronounced. That is, when a word that ends in a vowel is followed by a
word that begins in a vowel, the word-final vowel is not pronounced in favor of the
word-initial vowel. There are three exceptions to this generalization. These are: 1) when
two identical vowels occur across word boundaries they are both pronounced fully, in
the same manner as when they occur within a word; 2) words ending in /i/ do not
participate in coalescence โ both vowels are pronounced with an intervening glottal
70stop; 3) word-final /u/ is not eliminated, but rather reduced to /w/. (See ยง3.3.2 for more
information about exceptions 1 and 2.) Table 14 gives examples of each of the nonidentical two-vowel pairs in both phonemic and phonetic forms, along with a brief gloss.

Most words consist of one or two syllables, the great majority of syllables being V,
VC or CV. Some words are tri-syllabic, though this is uncommon. Words longer than
three syllables only exist as compound nouns or verbs. Stress is indicated by a higher
impressionistic intensity on the stressed vowel. Unstressed vowels are not reduced in
any way; they are just not pronounced as prominently as the stressed syllable. Stress in
single words almost always falls on the penultimate syllable; there are a few exceptions
as detailed in ยง3.3.1 and ยง3.3.2. There is also a tendency for words where the final
syllable contains a complex coda (i.e. two consonants) to have the primary stress.
Examples (8) to (10) have penultimate stress, while (11), with a complex coda, has final
stress.

'he cut'Stress placement in two-word compounds varies based on the semantics of the
compound. In some two-word compounds with a total of four or more syllables
between the two words, the primary stress can be on the antepenultimate. Otherwise,
in these compounds, the stress will fall in its natural position on each member of the
compound, with the stress on the second member of the compound being a weaker,
secondary stress. In noun-adjective compounds (see ยง5.6), the second element (the72adjective) has primary stress and the preceding noun has weaker stress. In noun-noun
compounds (see ยง5.11), each element has its own full stress, as it would if it were alone.
Examples (12) and (13) demonstrate these different stress patterns.

when calling someone. This latter example is typically heard with kin terms, such as
nawa 'mother' ata 'grandmother', etc. Also, the presence of affixes does not affect
stress placement; the stressed syllable prior to affixation in verbs, for example (see
Chapter 6) retains the stress after tense and person/number/gender marking is added.","[83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89]"
