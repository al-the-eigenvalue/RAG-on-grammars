Derivative affixes (always suffixes) modify the theme (4.122) to which they are affixed

and demonstrative formation. In the case of the majority of demonstratives, derivative
suffixing is obligatory.g-jamen-om

The grammatical processes of Fogny include affixation (prefixation and suffixation),
reduplication, compounding, word order and, in two lone instances, symbolism. Of these
processes, affixation (especially suffixing) is by far the most important.-teb-a
ba: b-eSYNTAXtion (3.42), forms noun and pronoun distributives. Partial reduplication, based on consonant reduction (3.41) and nasal assimilation (3.3), is used in secondary verbal theme
formation and as a syntactic marker.1In an effort to give a general over-view of Fogny, I have chosen in this chapter to isolate
salient features of the grammar, discussing them in terms of function rather than formal
details, the latter being reserved for subsequent chapters (5-12). The features are:
grammatical processes and basic word categories, the noun class system, verb inflections,
modifiers and basic sentence types.
4.1AND1 It is worth noting that a fair number of primary themes show complete phonetic reduplication:
e.g. -rabarab ‘before dawn’, kangorikang ‘a type of tree’. These might at one time have been
derived themes. There is the form ~rab ‘be late’, and like -rabarab, it too refers to time: balarzbburabe ‘the sun is late’ i.e, late morning.
2 E. Sapir (1921 :106).",[20]
"25AGRAMMAROFDIOLA-FOGNYcomplement object. In these cases, the noun phrase may either precede or follow the verb.
For example: In the sentence sijamenas sijol ‘the goats came’, the noun sijamenas acts
as the subject to the verb sijol and thus maintains concord. In the sentence sijamenas
kubuje ‘they killed the goat’, or ‘it is the goat that they killed’, there is no concord between
the noun (sijamenas) and the verb (-buj). Instead, the verb shows concord via the prefix
ku- with an understood subject.
Used independently of finite verbs, noun phrases function as genitives (4.343), as infinitive complements (4.36), and in concept juxtaposition (4.72).
‘There are seven major types of noun phrases (4.31-4.36): nouns, pronouns, nouns plus
adjectives, possessive phrases (4.312), phrases and sentences introduced by a concord
relational, infinitives, and infinitive phrases. Each of these types can occupy the samestructural slot.
A further category comprised of seminominals (4.37) functions as noun-phrases in all
ways except as finite verb subjects.
Noun phrases and seminominals, when used as verb complements, can be preceded by
a relational particle. This results in a prepositional phrase (9.4).
nijukojuk di kalimbisak ‘I saw him in the room’ (Here the complement kalimbisak
‘the room’ is preceded by the relational di indicating proximity.)
4.31Nouns4.311 Noun class markers: Each concord morpheme, henceforth called NouN CLASS
MARKER, defines a noun class, and each noun belongs to the class of its affixed marker.
By altering its marker a noun can change class. Marker alternation permits extensive
nominal inflection with the most important distinction being number (singular, plural,
collective, and mass), personal versus impersonal, and relative size. Beyond these, noun
classes specify semantic categories that range from the general, such as designating
abstract nouns, to the specific, e.g. indicating trees, boney objects, etc. Frequently, they
are used simply to define difference.

suffixes: definite articles and bound possessives. The definite article repeats the noun
class vowel or consonant and is thus an integral part of the concord system. The definite
26MORPHOLOGYANDSYNTAXarticle may in turn optionally suffix one of the locative vowels (6.11), usually the indefinite
-u.6 When the noun class marker is a vowel, the article cannot take this locative.

‘the hyenas’ also: si-mungun-asuThe bound possessive suffix includes a full set of person markers plus the general
subject/object pronoun Co (where C=the class consonant). These forms are nonemphatic when contrasted to the disjunctive possessives (7.35). Regardless of emphasis,
however, kin terms and words for ‘name’ (family, personal, etc.) use only the suffixed forms.

include personal and separate concord forms.","[21, 22]"
"4.341 The relative subject pronoun introduces the concord regent as the subject of a
subordinate verb. Verbs entering into the relative clause take complements. As already
noted (4.332), the relative subject pronoun is used in forming adjectives.

except that it introduces the regent noun as the object of the subordinate verb.

‘the babies belonging to his wife’4.344 ‘The quantity indicator appears directly before any numeral (except -akon ‘one’)
or any higher number series. It is not obligatory and a numerical phrase loses none of its
meaning, save emphasis, without it. The quantity indicator also joins with the morpheme
bu ‘how?’ to form an interrogative phrase.
simitas soni sibarkir
simitas soni bu nubaje‘four years’ (years-the there-are four)
‘how old are you? (years-the there-are how? you-have)4.35 INFINITIVES
Infinitives are forms that satisfy the definition of nouns: they take class prefixes and
require, when necessary, class concord. They affix, however, as verbs with limited vowel
assimilation (3.2) and are based on themes and secondary themes that normally functionas finite verbs. Unlike nouns they take complements (4.36).
28MORPHOLOGYANDSYNTAXInfinitives suffix bound verb objects and, when the infinitive refers to a specific act, the
definite article.

object)(-i second person singular4.36 INFINITIVE PHRASES
By taking complements, infinitives expand into potentially complex phrases. These,
like infinitives, have the same distribution as nouns. The infinitive takes a definite article
when the complement takes one, or is otherwise modified.enes asek is a simple infinitive phrase consisting of the infinitive e-pes ‘to look for’ and
the object complement a-sek ‘woman’. In the sentence nimamman ees asek ‘I want to
look for a woman’, the phrase can be replaced by a noun, e.g. nimamman
money’.
epesey asekaw ateyombakori ‘I want‘to look for the woman who ran from me’ (note the definite
article: -ey)4.37 SEMINOMINALS
Seminominals have a partial nominal distribution. Like nouns, they act as finite and
infinitive verb complements, as genitives and enter into concept juxtaposition constructions (4.72). Unlike nouns, they do not require nor take concord, nor do they ever function
as finite verb subjects. The two major categories of seminominals are time and place
locatives and interrogatives.

the concord consonant which, in about half of the cases, can be thought of as being based
on a noun. Thus the consonants b- and w-, which act as seminominals, are respectively
derived from the noun bin ‘place, general reference’ and waf ‘thing’. When the particular
expression permits, these noun-based forms can act as adjectives. The other consonants,29AGRAMMAROFMORPHOLOGYDIOLA-FOGNYsuch as m- which has an antecedent reference (‘this that is being referred to’) have no
such corresponding noun. A number of these latter consonants are completely outside of
the nounclass system.wanowan nutokon mi‘you eat anything’bin ube
mo mukan jak‘this place’
‘this (what has been said) is good’4.8FINITEVERBSA FINITE VERB functions as a predicate centre. It is based on a primary or secondary
neutral theme (4.122(a) ) and is tied to its stated or implied subject by concord inflection.
Besides concord, a finite verb inflects for complements and mood. The latter category
includes such varying functions as tense, voice, aspect, negation, and syntactic subordina-tion and emphasis. Other verb modifications, including a large number of aspects and
various progressive constructions, are formed, respectively, by verb combination and
concept juxtaposition, These will be discussed in the section devoted to sentence types(4.7).
4.51 CONCORD INFLECTION AND THE IMPERSONAL
Each finite verb, with the exception of the past subordinate (4.533(5) ) and the positive
imperative of some speakers (4.57), expresses concord with its expressed or implied subject. Except when taking a personal pronoun (apart from the 3rd person plural) finite
verb concord follows the usual alliterative pattern.
‘There are two forms to the three singular and the 1st person plural person markers:
a full form (e.g. ni-) and a stripped form (e.g. i-). In most instances the two forms
are in complementary distribution. At times, however, they contrast with the stripped
form, giving the subject an emphatic nuance which usually indicates emphasis (cf. discussion : 4.533 (A)), but at times indicates interrogation (4.74) or the imperative (4.577).
When a finite verb is neither imperative nor past subordinate and yet docs not inflect
for concord, the verb becomes impersonal. Such constructions are used primarily in
reference to a time period, to a general state, or with certain themes describing qualities.

‘if it is that you want’ (make-VE as you-want-NE)
‘it does not please me’ (please-not-me)4.52 Bounp COMPLEMENT SUFFIXES
Person suffixes, identical to those used as noun possessives (4.321), and pronouns of the
type Co (including locatives) serve as bound complements. In contrast to disjunctive
complements the bound forms are weak in emphasis.

Before attempting to set up any sort of structural paradigms or scales it would be best
to consider, in turn, each of the mood markers. In order to do this I have divided them
30ANDSYNTAXinto three rough categories: tense, mode, and syntactic emphasis and subordination. As.
will be come apparent from the discussion, a number of these markers show functional
overlap between categories. The imperative, which can be considered outside the system,
will be dealt with separately (4.57).
4.531 Tense: The alternation, combination, and absence of two markers allows us to
generate six moods that have tense as their primary, though never exclusive, reference.
These are: aorist (unmarked), future, future in the past, absolute past, remote past, and
past hypothetical.With the exception of the aorist and the future tense, marking is primarily used either in simple declarative sentences or, more commonly, in situations
requiring a direct time contrast. When employed for contrast they are usually confined to
single compound sentences (4.714), or to simple sentences with relative clauses (4.713).
Normally, only one verb or verb string (4.712) appears on either side of the ‘contrast
equation’. Thus one verb (or string) marked for some tense is contrasted against one otherverb (or string) and no more.
A variety of past conditionals are formed by using tense contrasts in combination with
an adverb expressing hypotheticalness (12.152(B) ).
Three other markers, viz. the contingent, the past subordinate and the indefiniteemphatic, clearly give a tense reference. In these cases the reference is subordinate to
other functions.
In verb strings it is only the head verb that can take tense markings.
a. Aorist: An utterance entirely unmarked for tense is assumed to indicate a recent past
or a present.ebay ninare‘I took/take the cow’ (cow-the I-take-NE)The aorist can be placed in a general tense context, including the future, by way of a
time locative. For example: funak fakon ‘one day’, sunken ‘last year’ etc. marks the past;
sa ‘now’ or jat ‘today’ marks the present; and kajom ‘tomorrow’, bulay ‘next year’ etc.
mark the future. The expression emitey ekan ‘God makes’ (i.e. God willing) or emitey
emang ‘God desires’ can be used without the future marker to indicate a wished-for
future event.
pa ninare ebe
sunken ninare ebe
kajom ninar ebe
emitey eman nujol‘now I take a cow’
‘last year I took a cow’
‘tomorrow I take the cow’
‘God desiring you will come’B. Absolute Future (F): The absolute future, i.e. the future with respect to the moment
of speaking is usually indicated. A future tense so indicated defines the over-all tense of
the discourse as definite and entirely expected. It may refer to a near or a remote time.
paninar eboy
‘I will take the cow’
c. Future in the Past (FP): The future marker can be used in a past context to define
a verb as future with respect to a preceding verb. The future in the past appears only in
contrast constructions. In a text describing a past event we have:
nanitubim akon penapuru telum ‘when I converted one (person) he left ‘Telum’
(when-I-convert one will-he-leave-from T.). The phrase ponapuru is placed in the
future to indicate that -puru ‘leave from’ is future to (resulted from) the verb under
consideration: -tubi ‘convert’. Another example:
31AGRAMMAROFDIOLA-FOGNYMORPHOLOGYANDSYNTAXno muyu kakilum pikulap lejigor ‘you who own (are in charge of) the funeral would
not touch (the body)’ (at-that-time you who-own funeral-the future-negative-youtouch). Here the future phrase lejigor is contingent on the prior state of owning
-kil; i.e. you have to be in a position of owning before you can be prohibited from
touching.waikun paniloein dekolaney ‘I nearly fell into the well’ (little F-I-fall-PA in-well-the)
manter basen nupgse:ne barbe, letujukeznol ‘if you had been looking for Bassen,
you might not have seen him’ (perhaps B. you-look-PA-NE here, F(neg)-you-seePA-him)D. Past Absolute (PA): The past absolute defines an action or state that no longer
exists at the time of speaking or at the time being spoken of. It is used in declarative
sentences and in ‘contrast equations’.manter basen nupese:ne barbs, letujukol ‘if you had been looking for Bassen, you
would not have seen him’.sunken nibaje:mbaj bekori, bare peme ibajut bo ‘last year I had money but now I
have none’ (last-year I-have-PA-VE money, but now I-have-not it)
This sentence could simply be:
Contrast:nibabaj bukori ‘last yearI had money’ (whether I still do is not underconsideration).
If the contrast between the past absolute and the more recent past (etc.) spills over into
an extended discourse involving a number of sentences, the past affix, following the general
rule, is not used. In its stead the text might open with the concord locative n> ‘at that
time’ or the particle nanin ‘in former times’ and then shift into the present with the particle pa ‘now’.
n> muyu panjiteb cebul . . . pa muyu kakilum anaw fagul jijem .. . ‘At that time
you (pl) would carry (it) yourselves . . . now you (pl) who own the man, yourselves
you go’ (at-that-time you (pl) F-you-carry self-you . . . now you (pl) who-own
man-the self-you you-go-hab-SS)
In certain set phrases the absolute past marker can appear as an independent theme
which indicates past being:
inje en
ten mo ern4.532 Mode: I have rather arbitrarily labelled as mode four markers that are loosely
grouped together by one common property: their presence defines a function; their
absence defines a contrast or opposite. If the unmarked alternates are taken into account,there exists eight possible modes.
A. The negative contrasts with the unmarked positive. With the negative future both
tense and negation are marked by one morpheme. A special variant of the negative mean-sunken nibajezmbaj bukorj ‘last year I had money’ (but not any longer)sunkenContrast the latter with:‘it was me’
‘if this (what is spoken about) was’ etc.","[23, 24, 25]"
"4.714Compound Sentence:A COMPOUND SENTENCE relates two distinct acts or twodistinct states. It is comprised of two independent sentences which may themselves be
simple or verb string sentences, or sentences with relative clauses. There are two basic
types: parallel and tense or contingency sentences.
A. Parallel sentences, which are separated by means of a connective, place two acts in
juxtaposition. The quality of the juxtaposition is determined by the connective.
namanay do kama nisend
niregoreg bareamanutro= ‘he wants it, therefore I gave (it) to him’
‘I told him, but he doesn’t want it’B. Tense and contingency sentences contrast two acts or states, in terms of tense,
contingency, or some combination of the two. They may be separated by one of the
connectives.
aman ja paniseno“if (when) he wants (it), I shali give (it) to him’sunken iyabut ani eleter yoli, nibone:nule:mibop sife:gir
‘last year I received no letter from you (even though) I had sent you three’ (last-year
I-take-not even letter yours, l-send-RP-ts-you-VE)
A compound sentence can join together with another sentence to form a compound of
2 higher order. (// indicates the higher order break; / indicates the lower.)
aregom ja / paniseno bekori // najaw esukey yola ‘If he speaks to me I will pay
him some money and he will go to his village’ (he-speaks-me C / F-I-give-him
money // and-he-go village-the his)
4.72CONCEPTJUXTAPOSITION4.721 Simple Juxtaposition: The juxtaposition of two noun phrases (including seminominals), or a noun phrase plus an impersonal verb construction describing a quality,
produces a simple juxtaposition.
Tense and location can be established by combining the appropriate locative or locatives
with the phrase. In these constructions place locatives form an immediate constituent
with the initial element while time locatives form an immediate constituent with the entire
juxtaposition.
inje ajaburun
‘I am a stranger’
inje ba:be / ajaburug
‘around here I am a stranger’
sunken / inje ajaburun
‘last year I was a stranger’
sunken // inje barbe / ajaburun ‘last year around here I was a stranger’47AGRAMMAROFDIOLA-FOGNY4.722 ‘Three types of progressive constructions are formed by juxtaposition construction. One emphasizes the subject, another the verb, and the third describes a state. The
latter two make use of finite verbs.

A juxtaposition phrase can join with a finite sentence to form a verb string or a compound sentence.kupilak koke di katirkor yok kugal ‘the children are fighting till they tire’
inje baregerul inje ejaw bo:t ‘having spoken to you I am going home’
4.74 INTERROGATIVE5SENTENCESAll interrogative utterances are marked by a slight rise in intonation over the last few
words. There are three common interrogative constructions: 1. Sentences formed with
one of the interrogative pronouns (4.322) and interrogative seminominals (4.37):
jilibaj jumba bey jam ‘where is my knife?’ (bey ‘where?’)
kupilak kokey ‘where are the children?’ (kokey ‘where are they?’)
uru wa ‘what’s that?’ (wa ‘what?’)
betekan bu ‘how (is one) to manage?’ (bu ‘how?’)
2. Sentences taking the stripped form of the personal pronoun (4.51):
itiger fugolaf ‘should I break off the stick?’3. Any positive construction can mark interrogation provided that it appears in the
appropriate speech context and is marked with the necessary intonation rise:
letulak sinanas
which can be glossed either as ‘you won’t start cooking’ or as ‘won’t you start cooking?’
For the sake of emphasis and precision Types 2 and 3 are optionally marked at the
beginning of the utterance by an adverb that indicates hypotheticalness. These adverbs
are also used in conditional constructions.
mante panujaw dakar‘perhaps (is it that) you will go to Dakar?’In the case of Sindian speakers these adverbs may be replaced by the question indicator
ban in phrase final position. ban is a Manding loan word.
‘will you go to Dakar?’
panujaw dakar banSECONDARY
Neutral themesNEUTRALare usually transformedFORMATIONinto secondary themesby affixing derivativemarkers that are classified, according to their distribution, as either nominal or verbal. Ingeneral, nominal markers appear only in nouns, while verbal markers can appear in both
nouns and verbs. For example, the agentive (5.111) suffixed to the theme -lib ‘makeslices’ gives the noun eliba ‘knife’ (nc-lib-agt) while the causative (5.211) suffixed to the
theme -ful ‘be dragged’ gives either the noun fufulen ‘snake’s track’ (nc-ful-caus) or the
verb -fulen ‘cause to drag sth.’
Both nominal and verbal derivative markers further sub-divide into productive and
unproductive groups. Productive markers can serve, where semantically feasible, with
any neutral theme. In contrast, unproductive markers have restricted use, being limited
to a finite number of themes. In both cases the meaning of the derived form can usually
be predicted as the sum of the primary theme plus derivative. At times, however, the
secondary forms have unpredictable and quite specialized nuances. Further, in the case
of several unproductive markers, the meaning of the secondary form is not at all, or only
partially, definable as the simple sum of the two morphemes.
There are certain limitations to the general distribution of nominal and verbal derivatives. First, in one recorded instance the abstract nominal (5.112) was observed functioning in a verbal construction (5.226). Secondly, not all of the verbal markers can appear in
nouns and those that do (primarily the productive ones) are limited to a finite number of
forms. ‘Thus, in the capacity of secondary nominal formers, verbal derivatives are unproductive. Thirdly, one of the derivative suffixes acts as a productive marker in both
nominal and verbal derivation. By the general rule this should define the suffix as a verbal
derivative. However, in contrast to the other verbal derivatives, it is entirely productive
when used in noun constructions. Also, its semantic function with nouns is distinct (albeitsimilar) from that with verbs. I have therefore chosen to consider it as a special case and
have listed it both as a productive noun (5.113) and as a productive verb (5.216) marker.
More than one derivative marker can be used in forming a secondary theme. ‘These
multiple derivatives (5.3) are of two common types: (1) two (or more) verbal derviatives
forming a verb or noun; (2) a verbal plus a nominal derivative forming a noun.
‘There remains two other processes for secondary theme formation. First, a number of
themes are formed into nouns by suffixing one of the inflectional verb markers (5.4). And,
secondly, compound themes can be formed by joining two themes together (5.5). Both
such types of forms are only rarely encountered and are entirely unproductive.","[32, 33]"
"0.2THE DioLa LANGUAGEDiola makes up a dialect-cluster with considerable inter-village variation. ‘The accom~panying map indicates the spread of the different dialects as well as the distribution of
Bainouk, a neighbouring language spoken in isolated pockets throughout the region. It
is Kennedy’s opinion (personal communication) that the Buluf variant will, upon further
study, prove to be three or four separate dialects.
Within the Diola cluster there are two important dialects, Fogny and Kasa (Casa),
which are structurally quite similar, and which, sociologically speaking, can be thought
of as variants of ‘standard’ Diola.
Kasa is spoken in and around the town of Ziguinchor, the regional capital, and in a
number of scattered areas to the west. It is used and understood throughout all of the
Diola region south of the Casamance.
Fogny corresponds to the ethnic sub-group of the same name and is spoken by about
85,000 native speakers in the area around Bignona. This dialect is understood by practically all Diola. Radio Dakar (the Senegalese national radio) uses Fogny in its Diola
language broadcasts.
The Diola group joins at some genetic distance with Bainouk and such languages as
Manjaco and Balanta (spoken in Portuguese Guinea) to form, in all probability, a subsection of the Western Atlantic Branch of the Niger-Congo family. ‘The Western Atlantic
Branch includes such other languages as Serer and Wolof (spoken in Senegal), Coniagui
and Baga (spoken in Guinea), Temne (spoken in Sierra Leone) and the far-flung Fulbe
(Peul, Fulani).
0.3 Diora Lancuace Srupirs
Aside from occasional word lists, only two extensive studies have ever appeared on
Diola: a grammar and dictionary of the ‘Carabanne’ dialect (which seems to be equivalent
to Kasa) published in rg09 by R. P. Wintz, and a grammar and lexicon on Fogny published in 1940 by R. P. Weiss. Wintz’s study gives a good account of the noun-class
system, but fails, because of Latin conceptualization, to give a clear picture of the rest of
the language. His dictionary is substantial and appears to be quite accurate. Weiss’s
grammar, though accurate and well-conceived, tries to cover too much ground in too
little space. Unfortunately he gives only a French~Fogny lexicon. I have occasionally made
use of some of his grammatical examples.
‘The Rev. Kennedy has written a short unpublished sketch of Kasa, as well as a brief
discussion of Diola dialects (1964) and Huluf noun classes (1963). W. A. A. Wilson, in
two survey articles (196rb, 1963) touches on Diola (Huluf dialect) noun classes and
numeration.",[9]

Text Analysis
MorPHEME INDEX
BIBLIOGRAPHYACKNOWLEDGEMENTSThe field work for this monograph was generously financed by the West African Languages Survey, while a grant from the American Council of Learned Societies facilitated
the initial stages of the writing.
I am particularly indebted to the Chairman and the Field Director of W.A.L.S.,
Joseph H. Greenberg and Robert G. Armstrong, for their interest, help, and encourage-ment.
While in Senegal, I have worked under the auspices of the Institut Francais d’ AfriqueNoire. Its Director, Th. Monod, gave me permission to use the facilities of the Institute
and kindly provided an office and lodgings during the period of final revision. Discussions
with Maurice Houis and Serge Sauvageot of the linguistic section at 1.F.A.N. have been
immensely profitable.
L-V Thomas of the Université de Dakar took particular interest in my work, introducing me, through his writings and conversations, to the details of Diola ethnography.
During the last month of the field period, while working on the dialect of Kwatay, I
spent much time with Rev. and Mrs. Alistair Kennedy. Rev. Kennedy placed at my
disposal his extensive knowledge of Kasa Diola, and our conversations over points of
comparison between the Fogny, Kwatay, and Kasa dialects gave me a much needed
perspective.
Kennedy and Thomas have provided the material for the Diola dialect map included
in this monograph.
Without the patience and perseverence of my two principal informants, Alassane Badji
and Paul Sagna, little progress would have been made in the painstaking task of linguistic
analysis. A number of other Diola friends, in particular Fofana Badji, Fidéle Badjian,
Dominique Coudjabi, and Souleymane Sané, provided additional material. I would also
like to thank all of the Diola people of Sindian and of Katinong who kept insisting that
[ get on with the business of learning their language.
Floyd Lounsbury, William Welmers, and especially Dell Hymes have taught me what
I know of linguistics. My debt to them is immeasurable. Richard Diebold and Karl
‘Teeter, as my thesis advisors, were most helpful in their comments on the earlier version
of this work that served as my doctoral dissertation.
Finally, my wife not only gave needed encouragement throughout the entire course of
work, but also took on the frightful job of typing the lion’s share of the manuscript.","[3, 4, 5, 6]"

EXTENDED NOUN AND SEMINOMINAL
PHRASES: SUBSTANTIVES - PART III
9.1 ADJECTIVALS
Considered in this section are higher numbers, genitive and possessive phrases and the
grouping of adjectives into single phrases. Higher numbers and genitive phrases are
functionally equivalent to adjectives; they may act either as noun modifiers or as substitutes. Possessive phrases, however, differ in that they must always include the regent, or,
as is possible in a group of special cases (9.132), its substitute.
Subject and object relative phrases are, like genitive phrases and higher numbers,
equivalent
to adjectives. Since their construction involves finite verbs, etc., I have deferred
their discussion
to the chapter
on syntax (12.13).
9.11 HicHer Numpers AND NuMBER PHRASES
g.111 Higher Cardinals: To the four concord numerals (7.361) are added four numerals
based on multiples of five. Each is formed with a neutral theme and is a noun in its own
right. They never show concord with the noun they modify, and if they are used as a
noun substitute they usually
take the quantity indicator (9.113).
futok
‘five’
cf. -tok ‘reach (for sth.), find s.o. at a place’
upen
‘ten’
kanen/upen
‘hand’
butinken
kabanan‘fifteen’
‘twenty’eban
finish’
-an
‘person’
Two decimal numbers have been borrowed(?) from Manding. Although they do not have
noun clase markers they are assigned to either class 3 (€) or 4 (si-).
ceme
‘hundred’ (Mdg. keme, WIf. temer)
wilj
‘thousand’ (Mdg. wull)
All other numbers are indicated as the sum or as the multiple of basic forms. Sums are
arranged in order of descending quantity and are separated from each other by the general
connective di. The concord numerals continue to maintain accord with their regent when
they are used in sums. If the form -okon ‘one’
is used in such series it takes the singular
class alternate
of its regent.sijamen futok di sigaba
‘seven goats’
uba:r kabanan di bekon
‘twenty-one trees’
kusek kabanan di butinken di kuba:kir ‘thirty-nine women’
Multiples consist of two numbers: a multiplicand followed by a multiplier. The two
numbers are placed one after the other and are NoT separated by a connective. Only the
form kabanan ‘twenty’ and the two borrowed forms ceme ‘hundred’ and wilj ‘thousand’
can serve as multiplicands. When so employed kabanan becomes bukan ‘people’. The
concord forms -gaba ‘two’, -fe:gir ‘three’, and -ba:kir ‘four’ serve as multipliers. Theselatter accord with the multiplicand by taking class 2 with bukan and class 4 with ceme
and wilj. A neutral theme numeral or a numeral sum may be used as a multiplier. In84
Urheberrechtlich geschutzies MaterialMORPHOLOGYANDSYNTAXconstructions of this sort concord themes accord with the multiplicand, while neutral
themes maintain their proper noun class marker.
bukan kugaba
‘forty’
ceme sife: gir
‘three hundred’
wilj sibazkir
‘four thousand’
ceme futok
‘five hundred’
ceme futok di sigaba
‘seven hundred’
ubs:raw wil] kabanan di upen di sigaba‘thirty two-thousand trees’In order to separate a numeral from a multiplier sum the regent must be restated. If the
number is abstract, the quantity indicator is used instead (9.113).
sijamenas ceme futok di sijamenas sigaba ‘five hundred and two goats’
ceme futok di soni sigaba
‘five hundred and two’
If the regent has a different class marker than the multiplicand, the separation can be
indicated by the concord pattern.
kusekak ceme futok di sigaba
‘seven hundred women’
kusekak ceme futok di kugaba
‘five hundred and two women’The regent must be restated, regardless of class, if a neutral theme is to be separated
from a multiplier sum.
uba: raw wilj kabanan di uba:raw unen diugaba‘twenty thousand and twelve trees’Multiples can be combined into sums and, following the rule of descending quantity,
multiples precede single numbers and higher multiples precede lower multiples.sijamen bukan kugaba dupen di sife:gir ‘fifty-four goats’
uba:r ceme futok di siba:kir di bukan kugaba di upen di bakon ‘nine hundred and
fifty-one trees’
9.112 Higher Ordinals: Ordinals higher than -foken ‘fifth’ (7.362) are formed by using
cardinal numbers in one of two types of subordinate verb sentences introduced by a
relative subject pronoun. One of these sentences shows a feature unique to Fogny
(though common in other Diola dialects): a definite article that is in concord with the
regent noun is suffixed to the last number. Since the ordinal sentence begins with a relative
subject concord the entire phrase can be thought of as something like an extended nounwith a definite article suffix.
In both sentence types, if the regent noun is plural, then -akon ‘one’ takes the singular
class alternate of the noun and, contrariwise, if the regent is singular the other concord
numerals take the appropriate plural alternate.
Sentence type I:
sjlu:pas sakanum futok di yakon
‘the sixth (group of) houses’ (houses-the thatmake-SS five and one)
asekaw akanum unen di kugaba
‘the twelfth wife’
ejameney yakanum ceme di yakon ‘the hundred and first goat’
Sentence type II:
sjlu:pas sakanum futok di yekonas ‘the sixth (group of) houses’ (houses-the thatmake-SS five and one-the)
asekaw akanum unen di kugaba:w ‘the twelfth wife’
ejameney yakanum ceme di yakoney ‘the hundred and first goat’85A GRAMMAROFDIOLA-FOGNY9.113 Quantity indicator: All cardinal numeral phrases, including those based on
single concord forms, may optionally be introduced with the quantity indicator -oni or
-on>. When the consecutive markers pa- and ma- (8.1 (E-F)) are used with a nominal
numeral the use of -2ni is obligatory. It is usually used to introduce extended number
series or numbers made up entirely of nominal numerals. ->ni is never used with an
ndependent -akon ‘one’.
natek> noni futok
‘he hit him five times’
simitas soni upen di siba:kir
‘fourteen years’
kupil koni kabanan di butinken di kufe:gir ‘thirty-nine children’
9.12 GENITIVE PHRASES
The genitive particle can introduce any type of noun or seminominal phrase. In certain
rapid and emphatic constructions the particle is simply dropped, or is dropped with the
position of the regent and genitive nouns being reversed. The independent concord
genitive mati (8. (1)) can introduce a finite verb sentence.nibebet funakaf fati ejay kasa‘I determined the day for going to the Casa’ebaj to fere yeti betey
pankumanj mati apolil nakeket
di kunen di jibal jikun mitay‘he (hyena) had there a means of running away’
‘they will know about their son’s death’
‘and they placed on (the floor) a small bowl of
palm oil’ (normally this would read: . . . jibal
jikun jeti mjtay)
kafokak watay ‘the time of the burial’ (cf. watay yeti kafokak)
9.13 PossEssIvE PHRASES
9.131 A noun marked with a bound person marker (7.132) can be extended into apossessive phrase consisting of two (or more) nouns linked together as possessor and
possessed. The possessed noun, which acts as a regent, follows the possessor and is
linked to it by way of the person marker.
Although functionally equivalent to the disjunctive possessive adjective (7.35) and the
genitive relational (9.12), possessive phrases are limited in that the possessor is usually a
personal noun.
When a possessive phrase is used to designate kinship links, several possessed nouns
can be strung out together.
asekaw esuko elujluj § ‘the woman’s village is far’
yisuf ampa> ati apola = ‘Yisuf’s father’s brother’s son’
9.132 ‘Self Phrases’: Fogny has a number of frequently employed phrases used to
designate uniqueness. Their structure is roughly equivalent to that of possessive phrases.
They consist of a noun phrase (which may be a noun substitute or seminominal) plus a
theme suffixed with a bound person or subject/object marker referring back to the noun or
seminominal phrase. When used as a finite verb subject the noun phrase acts as the
regent, and when used as a verb complement, the noun phrase may be reduced to a
relative object pronoun (7.412) or to a bound object (4.52).
86A GRAMMAROF DIOLA-FOGNY9.22 be
The seminominal be can introduce any kind of noun or seminominal phrase. When
it is
used with an infinitive it implies
a near future; otherwise, it has the sense of ‘towards’.inje be dakar
‘I (go) towards Dakar’
inje bejaw dakar
‘I am going to go to Dakar’
be banaki:znum
‘towards where he lives’
be reru fatiya
‘towards way up high’
inje nimamman beteb buyinab be sindey yumbe ‘I want to take the body to my
home’
(In this sentence the second be phrase is a complement of the
infinitive introduced by the first be.)9.3 NOUN AND SEMINOMINAL STRINGS
Two or more noun phrases, or two or more seminominals or seminominal phrases, can
be placed in series with the connective di optionally separating each member off from the
others. A noun or a pronoun, plus di, plus an infinitive placed as a verb complement,forms a progressive.
inje dakila ‘I and he’
ejameney uye di ebay uya ‘this goat and that cow’
asekaw di kupilak koni kugaba ‘the woman and two children’
ubsa:raw uwa woni unen di sjba:ras use soni futoksticks’
fuken di fukenum nije sinjan‘those ten trees and these five‘yesterday and the day before I went to Sindian’niken to di fankaf (di) nike bati atio‘sometimes there in the courtyard, sometimesat his brother’s home’
toke yo di furi ‘(this) found him eating’ (note impersonal (4.51))9.4 NOUN PHRASE AND SEMINOMINAL PREPOSITIONS
A number of relational forms are used as prepositions to introduce noun phrases and
seminominals, Although such constructions do not appear in genitive phrases (9.12),
they otherwise have the same distribution as seminominals and seminominal phrases.
Most of the relational forms also serve as verb string and compound connectives (12.123,
12.151).
A. The general connective di is frequently used as a preposition, It indicates proximity
and can be glossed, depending on the context, as ‘on’, ‘in’, ‘with’, etc.
anilaw smb ba:ba di fankaf
‘the child is there in the courtyard’
nen jiliba:j di tabuley
‘put the knife on the table’
di kalibisak nijuko
‘I saw him in the room’
B. The connective nen ~ nin has the sense of ‘as’ or ‘like’.
narem nin alulumew
manomabom nen iper
kakemunek kumanji nin kawa>‘he is like the European’ (he-stops-SS as E.-the)‘that is why we are here as now’
= ‘his foot is as well known as his face’c. The forms kabirin~birin~bupor~kabupor have the sense of ‘since’ and are used
to introduce time locatives or some noun phrase defining past time.","[57, 58, 59, 60, 61]"
"MORPHOLOGYDIOLA-FOGNY‘the small goats ate’ (not: “the goat ate any kind of food)If the noun is absent a personal pronoun, a concord pronoun or adjective, or a phrase
introduced by a concord relational, may act in its stead as a substitute. Finite verbs can
be thought of as substitutes only in so far as the regent noun need not be present to form
a grammatical utterance. A finite verb cannot replace a noun. In all cases where the noun
is absent, even when a finite verb stands alone, the concord morpheme implies the
structural presence of the noun.
Within a series, concord is strictly maintained whether or not the regent is present, and
whether or not there are intervening words that interrupt the sequence.§
si-jamen-as si-jol ‘the goats came’
si-gaba si-jol ‘two came’s-o si-jol‘they came’si-nifan-as si-jol ‘the old ones came’
si-jol ‘they came’
si-jamen-as s-eti alasan si-jol ‘the goats belonging to Alasanne came’
s~eti alasan si-jol ‘those of Alasanne came’
But not: *s-eti si-jol (which makes as much sense as English “of came)4.3NOUNPHRASESA concord series breaks into two structural units: noun phrases and finite verbs. Hach
can appear without the other, although, as stated above (4.2), a concord prefix on a verb
refers to a regent noun even when the latter is not overtly expressed. A noun phrase can
function vis-a-vis a verb either as its subject or as its predicate complement. When the
noun phrase shows concord with the verb it is acting as the verb subject. In such cases
the noun phrase always precedes. When a finite verb does not show concord with a
particular noun phrase to which it is adjoined the noun phrase can be taken as the verb’s
4 A purely formal definition of nouns, put forth by Harris (1951:183) for Swahili, and by W. A. A.
Wilson (1961a:41) for Balanta, is based on the idea of limited possibility. Within a concord series
one of the neutral themes is observed to take only a few of the concord morphemes. Such a form is
defined as a noun and considered the concord regent. Thus, the Fogny word -rj qua noun can take
fueri, mu-ri, ji-ri, but gua verb can take the full lot plus the special bound personal forms.
Aside from the fact that one such neutral theme might just be able to take all possible concord
morphemes, this limited possibility approach fails to define, in formal terms, the fact that all the concord forms are completely dependent on the noun. This is self-evident if one considers the meaning.
5 There are a number of nouns that do not, or only optionally, join in a concord series. These
words are usually, but not always, loan words. Their class membership can always be determined
by the behaviour of other concord forms in the series (7.12).",[21]
"The more important ones are -em ‘be’, -sno ‘exist, be’,and -en quotation marker ‘say’. Only one was observed to function as a noun. They are
referred to as defective verbs.
4.2 CONCORD
Fogny has a system whereby one discontinuous morpheme finds multiple expression in
several words within an utterance. As is characteristic of many Niger-Congo languages
with similar systems, expression is primarily by phonetic repetition, usually consonant,
but sometimes vowel, alliteration, Such alliteration is called concorD, and the sum of
words expressing concord in any one utterance is called a CONCORD SERIES. Fogny has
nineteen discontinuous concord morphemes. These morphemes are usually prefixed, or
occasionally both prefixed and suffixed, in each environment. Concord morphemes
formed with consonants always have the phonetic shape CV when used as prefixes. This
V is subject, in most cases, to elision before other vowels (3.21).
(The concord morpheme is set off by a double stroke / /):
/fuj-goxl-a/f/ /f/-umbe /f/-o-/f/-e ‘this is my stick’ (stick-the mine here)/si[-jamen-a/s/ /s/-umbea /s/~2/s/-e ‘these are my goats’
/bu/-berr-a/b/ /b/a-mak-a/b/ /bu/-lolo ‘the big tree fell’ (tree-the which-(is)-big itfell)
/u/-borr-e/w/ /w/e-mak-a/w/ /u/-lolo ‘the big trees fell’ (3.21, 3.24)
The word categories involved in concord include all neutral themes and concord forms.
In each series there is present or implied one neutral theme (-go:|, -jamen, and -barr in
® Considered quantitatively, themes that function primarily as verbs have the phonetic shape CVvc,
CVNC, and CY, with most, but by no means all exceptions being loan words. By contrast, themes
serving mainly as nouns (i.e. those referring to concrete objects) quite often have complex phoneticshapes. Consider: ~musijonkon‘candy’, -jambarijas ‘a kind of spider’.",[21]

There are two sets of mutually exclusive optional noun suffixes: definite articles and
possessives.
7.131 Definite article: The definite article consists of a- plus the class consonant. In
three cases where the class is marked only with a vowel, classes 1, 3, 8 (a-, €-, u-), the
definite article is -aw, -ey, and -aw respectively (3.24). All of the definite articles, except
class 17 (wa-) and those without a class consonant, may optionally suffix one of the demonstrative vowels, usually the indefinite -u (6.11).

7.132 Possessive suffixes: The personal markers which serve in nouns as possessives
and in verbs (10.21) as object complements are as follows:
=m
‘my’
-ola ~-olal ‘ours (incl)’
‘ours (excl)’ (regional variants)
-uli ~-olj
‘your (sg)’
“|
‘your (pl)’
ou ~ -ul
‘his’ (3.7)
-~-31
“i: ~-il
‘their’
68MORPHOLOGYANDSYNTAXThere is a distinction which seems to have died out between an inclusive dual and plural
1st person, a distinction which seems to include not only the person markers but also the
disjunctive possessive and subject/object pronouns (6.2) and the discontinuous subject
verb affix (10.12).4 For the person markers the respective forms are ->la and -lal. Since
these two forms parallel exactly the morphophonemic alternation V~VI (3.7) observed,
in the case of person markers, for-> ~ -3l,-u ~-ul, and-i: ~-il, the disappearance of the
dual indicates a morphophonemic structure interfering with a semantic contrast.
All my informants, whose ages range from 20 to 30 years, denied the existence
of the
contrast. However, in a series of conversations between two elders (aged about 75) the
contrast appears to have been made. In two instances between words, and once within a
word, the predicted morphophonemic forms did not appear and from the context it was
certain that the two old men were distinguishing dual from plural. Further, although all
other instances of the plural inclusive followed the expected morphophonemic pattern,
none contradicted the dual-plural distinction implied by the context of the conversation.
Instances where the morphophonemic alternation was ‘violated’ did not involve the
person markers, but instead the disjunctive subject/object pronoun and the suffixed section of the bound 1st person plural inclusive subject marker.
wala ulakoae
‘we stay’ (context indicates dual (the expected form would have
been: walal ulakoale — especially the -al))
wala usofam
‘we take care of’ (dual context)Some examples where the dual-plural context parallels the ——eexpecta-tions are:emitey ekatolam‘God leaves us’ (dual context)birin walakaikun
jamamay yololal‘since we were small’ (dual context))
‘our times’ (plural context)etc.","[46, 47, 48]"
"74MORPHOLOGYANDSYNTAX7.363 The neutral theme -lamu:ka (‘back’-++ -a agentive (5.111)) indicates the last of
a series. It optionally takes the definite article.
sjlu:pas sjlamu:ke:s
‘the last houses’
elu:pey elamu:kay _— ‘the last house’
7.37 NEUTRAL THEME ADJECTIVES
All neutral themes can function as adjectives. Their formation as such varies, however.
There are four basic types:A. Those formed by juxtaposition and without any accord whatsoever. (These can be
thought of as reduced genitive phrases (9.12).)
B. Those formed by ordinary concord agreement, i.e. those that follow the pattern of
other concord forms.
c. Those formed with a relative pronoun (7.41).
D. Those that may be formed by either methods B or c.
Themes that function as nouns normally use methods A or B; themes that function as
verbs use method c, and themes that function almost exclusively as adjectives use method
D. There are very few themes in this latter category. There is always considerable variation between Bignona and Sindian speakers as to the assignment of specific themes. Thus
when the theme -lu:p ‘house’ is used as an adjective it is assigned to A by Sindian speakers:butun elu:p § ‘house granary’
and to B in Bignona:
butun bulu:p
And in another example the form -njne ‘male’ is assigned to B in Sindian:
eyenenine‘male dog’and D in Bignona:
eyen enjne ~ yanineConstructions formed by ordinary concord may optionally take one of the following
suffixes: the definite article (7.121), or the abstract derivative -ay (5.112) with or without
definite article. Thus the pattern:
CV + theme +$
sc
ay + (-aC)Those formed by way of the subject relative pronoun obligatorily take one of the following
suffixes: the simple subordinate marker mi (4.533) (thus forming a subordinate clause
(12.131)) the noun emphasis marker (4.533), or a definite article. Thus the pattern:
Ca + theme +.-aCThose forms that take both the CV- and the Ca- concord (category D) optionally suffix
the definite article:CV
a } + theme + (-aC)

7.411 The relative subject pronoun consists of the morpheme -a- prefixed with a classconsonant. It is prefixed directly onto the verb theme. Personal forms ordinarily take class
1 or 2 depending on the number. The singular personals and the 1st person plural can
optionally, when the regent noun is present, dispense with the relative pronoun altogether.
The 2nd person plural optionally takes ka- or ja- as its relative pronoun.kupilak karinulsm — ‘the children who arrive’
eyeney yagonse
muyu kakilum
muyu jambom
Injenom
inje ambom‘the dog that is mad’ or ‘mad dog’
‘you (pl) who own’
‘you (pl) who are there’ (<ja-+-em-++-bo-+-m) (3.221)
‘I who am’
‘I who am there’7.412 The relative object pronoun consists of the morpheme -an~~ani prefixed with a
class consonant. It is placed directly before the subordinate verb subject which may be
simply a bound verb prefix or an entire noun phrase. When the verb is impersonal the
pronoun is prefixed directly to the verb theme.

The genitive particle Cati ~ Ceti (3.222) is invariant. In certain expressions, however,
the form Cata is used. This is actually a dialect variant and is common for the Fogny of
Bignona and for the Carabanne or Kasa (Wintz, p. 57; Kennedy, 1963:109) dialect.kunjnak kati esukey

The quantity indicator Coni or Cond (the latter for Bignona) is invariant. The Cono
version brings to mind the defective verb -nd ‘be like, exist’ (4.581 (B)).
76MORPHOLOGYANDSYNTAX7.5 INFINITIVES
Infinitives always take a noun class prefix and can optionally suffix a definite article or
person marker, The two suffixes can co-occur.
The infinitive noun class marker is usually predictable. Forms of one syllable take class
3 (€-) and those of more than one syllable take class 7 (ka-).

‘to show’kajijiren

markers other than 3 and 7. Classes 5 (fu-), 9 (bu-), 10 (ji-), rz (mu-), 13 (ba-), and 16
(ja-) were recorded acting in this capacity. When these ‘irregular’ themes function as
nouns they usually use the same marker. All of these irregular forms that have a onesyllable theme will take, without change in meaning, the regular Class 3 prefix. This alternation, though accepted by all informants, was never observed in actual practice.

7.61 TIME AND PLACE LOCATIVES
Seminominal time and place locatives subdivide formally into noun-like forms, concords, and independent themes, ‘The noun-like seminominals are forms of two or more
syllables with initial atonic phonemes that parallel noun class markers. Their referenceis always specific. For the sake of convenience, I have considered these initial phonemes
as disfunctional noun class markers. (They never enter into a concord series, the sine
qua non of a class marker, and thus cannot be called functional). Several facts suggest
that they actually are noun class markers. First, one form shares a neutral theme with77
Eléments sous droits d'auteurA GRAMMAROF DIOLA-FOGNYseveral nouns: bu-lay ‘next year’, cf. ba-lay ‘sun’, fu-lay ‘day’, ku-lay ‘days’. Secondly,
another form, in a manner similar to nouns, alternates its class markers in order toachieve different meaning: fa-tum ‘underneath’, ba-tum ‘between the legs’. Thirdly, oneform functions as either a noun or as a place locative: balamu:k ‘back’ or ‘in back of’. And,
finally, all of the forms can be assigned to one of the existing classes.
A number of the forms, especially the time iocatives, optionally take the derivative
suffix -aray (5.122), and four of the time locatives take the time position suffixes (6.12).
From available information place locatives take class markers 13, 14, and 18, while time
locatives take markers 4, 5, 7, 9, and in one instance, 18. Some examples are:

— ‘in back of?’
‘above’
‘outside’
‘afternoon’The concord locatives, of which there are six, act as independent concord forms (8
(a-F)), and, within the limitations imposed on seminominals in general, their function
and distribution is identical to these forms. A special set of concord place locatives
regularly take the demonstrative suffixes (6.11). (A fuller discussion of concord locatives
follows directly in chapter 8.)
Only a few locatives formed with independent themes were recorded. They all refer to
unspecific time.
jfia~ per ~ peme ~ ipenowpemeneme ~ ipeine‘soon’, just nownana ~ nanin ~ nona
jat‘in former times’
‘today’7.62 INTERROGATIVE: wa
The seminominal form wa asks for the specification of an object rather than its differentiation as in the case of the concord interrogative Cay (7.221). The difference betweenthe two is roughly similar to the English contrast of ‘what?’ versus ‘which?’ (or, ‘who?’).
Thus, in a sentence constructed with a concord interrogative we might have yey nubaje
‘which one do you have?’ with some member of class 3 as understood. In contrast, the
sentence wa nubaje ‘what do you have?’ has nothing understood.
wa can take the form way or way ma. The latter, way ma, usually has the meaning
‘what’s the matter?’. When it is used with the indefinite demonstrative ure (8.1(G)) in a
concept juxtaposition construction (12.21) it becomes waw to form ure waw ‘what is
this?’. It also combines in a special phrase with the form -mban to form wamban ‘why?’
(cf. ay amban ‘who is it?’) and with the genitive mati (8.2(1)) to form mati wa ‘concerning
what?’, ‘why?’.
wa forms a progressive using a juxtaposition construction (12.223) where the redundant
pronoun can be either wa or wo.wa nukane di wa ~ wa nukane di w>‘what are you doing?’

INDEPENDENT CONCORD FORMS:
SUBSTANTIVES - PART II
This chapter considers in detail the independent concord forms (4.4) enumerated in the
accompanying table (Table 7). The discussion deals first with the seminominal and then
with the nominal forms. The section letters correspond to those in the table.
8.1 SEMINOMINALS
A. (b-) The forms prefixed with the consonant b- are ultimately derived from the noun
bin ‘general area’ (e.g. ‘around here’). The form b> has a special alternate ba:b- that
obligatorily takes one of the demonstrative suffixes (6.11). A free variant
of bazb is
bob(-), and when the form takes the demonstrative vowel -u the alternate bub- is possible:
bubu. The stressed emphatic pronoun (7.23) can take bo in lieu of a demonstrative
suffix. bey and bobey both have the same meaning, ‘where?’; their distribution, however,is different. bobey can only appear in concept juxtaposition constructions (4.72). ban is
not to be confused with the neutral theme -ban ‘finish’ and the connective ban ‘and then’.
banoban
has the sense of ‘everywhere’, ‘each place’, ‘nowhere’, etc. bati and bumbs (etc.)
have a special meaning referring to place of residence.ply> nalako bo

‘at Yisuf’s brother’s home’
bumbe suma:nsum
‘home pleases me’
B. (t-) Forms prefixed with t- are based on the noun tin ‘a restricted circumscribed area’
(eg. a table top). It parallels the forms based on bin except that t- is never used with the
disjunctive possessive nor the genitive. The demonstrative
alternate of to is ta:t- ~ tot-.

nanonan (naznana, etc.), ‘always, never’, nakon ‘at one time, once upon a time’. nakon
can be used interchangeably with funak fakon ‘one day’, and both are occasionally used atthe beginningof a folktale. nike can be made into a distributive: nikenike ‘from time totime’.

All number series (9.11) use one of the ordinal verb phrases. pakon can have the sense of
‘together’. Two other forms are nalamu:zka ‘the last time’ (7.363) and pamene ‘several
times’ (-men ‘be full’).

"The present chapter is devoted to the individual forms; Chapter 8 deals with independent
concord forms (4.4), and Chapter 9 with extended noun phrases. Consideration of
phrases introduced by relative pronouns have been deferred to the chapter on syntax
12.13-14).
7.1 NOUNS
7.11 Noun Crass MARKERS
The noun class markers group into singular-plural pairs, collectives, mass, abstract,
infinitive, seminominal, and adverbial markers. All of these, except the latter three (cf.
7.5, 7-6, and 11(c)), are covered in this section. 7.116 gives examples of extended nounclass alternation. A glance at part £ of this section clearly demonstrates the extensive use,
beyond number and alternation, to which noun class markers may be put.
The entire group of noun class markers can be fully distinguished only when they are
prefixed to nouns. All other forms taking class concord, viz. pronouns, adjectives,
relationals and finite verbs, prefix class markers of the shape Ca as Cu.
In all cases, verbs excepted, the vowels of noun class markers are subject to assimilation
before themes beginning
with a vowel (3.21).
The nineteen noun classes with their respective functions are as follows:

48THEME49NOUNMARKERSAGRAMMAROFDIOLA-FOGNY5.111 Agentive: The suffix -a usually defines the noun as the agent by which the act
described by the theme is accomplished. For example: -lib ‘make slices’ gives eliba
‘knife’, -tsp ‘build’ gives ateba ‘builder, one who builds’, -lob ‘talk, gossip, scandalize’
gives aloba ‘one who talks, gossips or scandalizes’,
In a number of cases the agent-act relationship is not so clear-cut: thus kara ‘women’
(<ku--ar-+a) is based on -ar which also forms the noun for ‘belly’ (fu--ar), and era:fa
‘bottle’ comes from the theme -ra:f ‘suck at the breast’. These variations in the semantic
relationship represent only a very small minority of the derived themes.
5.112 Abstract: The suffix -ay always gives the theme an abstract or general reference.
From -lob ‘talk, scandalize’ we have mulobay ‘scandal’, from -ti ‘same sex sibling’ weMORPHOLOGYcan also be buwiyab), -kizn ‘inhabit’ gives bakirn5.113Resultive:(which also appears as a productive verb marker(5.216)) forms a noun that designates the result of the quality expressed by the primarytheme. For example: -lib ‘make slices’ gives -libum ‘cuts (resulting from slices)’ as in:bulibum bati karazfa ‘cuts from (broken) bottle’; also batium ‘association of same sex
sibling’, i.e. ‘group that results from being same sex siblings’ as in:
betjum baji ‘the brothers (sisters) Badji’; and mulobum
feelings’, etc.‘the result of scandal, i.e. bad5.114 Instrumental: The suffix -ume and its free variant -uma define the noun as the
instrument whereby the act described by the theme is accomplished. ‘Thus: -pito ‘climb’
gives enitorme ‘ladder, stairs’, -jin “filter water’ gives kejinume ‘water filter’ etc.
It can be profitably argued that the instrumental is simply a combination of the resultive
-um with the agentive -a, and indeed the gloss ‘instrumental’ can be read as: ‘the agent of
the result’. However, because of its lax variant and such common usage it seems best to
give it independent structural (if not historical) status.
The link between the instrumental, the agentive and the resultive comes out ja certain
instances where themes formed with the instrumental receive the same gloss as those
formed with either the agentive or the resultive. In all cases where this happens closer
inspection reveals that the instrumental gloss is always more precise or specialized. For
example, when -lib ‘make slices’ suffixes the agentive to give eliba the gloss is the general
word ‘knife’, whereas the derivative formed with the instrumental, elibume gives ‘sharp
knife used for making slices, such as one used for ciccumcising’. Similarly bupolum (from
~pal ‘friend’) is glossed as ‘result of friendship, e.g. an association’, while bupalume is
specifically an ‘association of friends’.

In certain circumstances, especially when it is used with an intransitive theme, the
causative has the appearance of a ‘transitive former’.
‘I ran’ (I-ran-VE)
nitetey‘the sun made us run (seek shelter)’ (sun+the it-ran-caus-bala:b buteyenslateyenus (incl)-VE)
The idea of causality, however, only overlaps with, and is by no means equivalent to, that
of transitiveness. A causative suffix used with an intransitive theme can produce an intransitive derivative. For example, the theme -fal ‘change age status’ gives:
‘you are (have become) old’ (you you-change-caus-NE)
aw nufalene
The sense of causality remains, but this time it refers to the subject. A literal gloss would
be something like: ‘you have been caused to change age status’. This particular secondary
form can also be used in a transitive construction:anolo nafalene‘she weaned her child’_If the causative is affixed to a transitive theme to form a transitive derivative, a double
object must be used. In this construction the subject causes object-1 to act on object-2
(which may be an infinitive). Thus for the theme -fum “break open sth’ we have:
‘I broke open peanuts’

remotely related to the secondary form. Some examples are, for the seminominals:
bujomuray ~ bujom ‘morning’, tiyenerey ~ tiyan ‘outside’, fukaray ~ fuk night ; and

Bound person markers and bound concord pronouns are grouped as second position
suffixes. All suffixes that precede person markers and concord pronouns are first position
suffixes, and all those that follow are third position suffixes. In one case, part of a first
position suffix may optionally follow a person marker (cf. £ below). The passive mode
and the noun emphasis markers are mutually exclusive with person markers and concord
pronouns and thus could be thought of as second position suffixes. For functional reasons,
however, I have placed the passive with the first position suffixes (where one finds the
negative and habitual modes), and the noun emphasis with the third position suffixes
(a position occupied by the simple subordinate and verb emphasis markers).
When two person markers come together, the second position sub-divides, with the
indirect object preceding the direct.
The third position includes all of the emphasis/subordination markers except the past
subordinate. The contingent and the mi variant of the simple subordinate are ‘loosely’
tied to the verb. They may be separated from it by partial juncture and need not respond
to vowel harmony. Because no other form can be placed between them and a bound
complement, they cannot be thought of as postclitics. The reduplicated verb and the
noun emphasis markers always respond to vowel harmony.nibone

the emphatic) would be taken merely as a prediction: ‘you will sit down here’.
In a text the expression menoman pambijol was glossed as ‘at all costs (manoman) PILcome’. The use of the emphatic stressed the ‘at all costs’ and also expressed the wish and
33AGRAMMAROFDIOLA-FOGNYthe idea of coming, rather than the fact. This was borne out later in the passage where
the fact of coming was contradicted: ani kajom letinolen . . . ijaw ... etc., ‘not even tomorrow will I be able. . . to go. . .’ (This latter sentence, a statement of fact, did Not
use the emphatic).
The sentence, pambiriben mbijaw itoka bo ‘I’ll follow so as to find him there’, was
differentiated from an identical sentence without emphatic markings (paniriben manijaw
itoko b>) in terms of emphasis and indefiniteness. The former is to be taken as ‘une sorte
de menace’ (a kind of threat), while the latter was described as merely factual. A situation
calling for the original emphatic phrasing was given as follows: ‘you ask someone and he
fails to show up; you are annoyed (emmerdé) and decide to follow after him yourself’.
The emphatic, used independently of the future marker, maintains its future (or moreexactly non-past) reference. It will not accept a past time locative (e.g. fuken ‘yesterday’):
“fuken mbunar (non-grammatical); it will only accept those referring to the present orfuture:MORPHOLOGYA. Immediate E/S

reduplication, the simple subordinate shifts emphasis from the verb to its immediate,usually post-verb, environment. It is used primarily in verb strings and relative clause
constructions.‘now you should take’aninaw aket mi nasenarnsen eborykajom mbunar‘tomorrow you should take’who-died SS he-gave-me-VE cow-the)This reference finds its most common use with the negative imperative (4.57) where it

with:
takumbugor
which can be freely translated as ‘don’t let me see you touch (it)’, or, as it was originally
translated into French, ‘j’amerais bien que tu ne touches pas’.
It is worth noting that the emphatic marked with a future time locative (e.g. kajom
‘tomorrow’) will inflect for all persons, but when marked with a present locative (e.g.
Jia ‘now’, jat ‘today’) will inflect for all persons except the 1st person singular and plural.

verbal affixes (as well as theme reduplication) that serve in a variety of different ways to
relate the verb to its syntactic environment. There are three dimensions which define
each of the markers: any relationship is (1) either general or precise, and (2) either with
respect to the immediate or with respect to the external environment. And (3), in any
relationship the verb is defined either as subordinate or as emphasized.
I have considered the immediate environment as being confined to the verb, its subject,
and its complement, and the external environment as extending beyond to include the
two sections of a compound sentence (4.714). The operation of the external markers
(p and E below) produces structures similar to those involved in tense ‘contrast equations’
(4.531), a similarity that is all the more striking because the two external markers themselves define tense. In the case of the external markers, however, the dimension of
emphasis-subordination and the idea of a contingent relationship are both more important
34‘the man who died gave me the cow’ (man-the3. Noun Emphasis (NE) (immediate, general, subordinate): Functionally equivalent
to the simple subordinate, the noun emphasis marker deflects emphasis from the verb.
Except in certain special constructions (12.152(D) ) it is used exclusively to emphasize the
subject or the complement, most particularly a pre-verb complement. In most situations
the SS marker can be used in its stead. The reverse, however, is not true.
ebe ninome‘I bought a cow, it is a cow that I bought’ (cow I-buy-NE)The placement of immediate emphasis-subordination can be greatly varied by altering
the position of the complement and by using a disjunctive subject pronoun. Generally,
complements that precede the verb, and subjects that are directly preceded by a disjunctive pronoun, have more emphasis than, respectively, complements that follow the verb
and subjects without disjunctive pronoun support. Consider the paradigm:

”As noted above (4.51), several personal pronouns have two forms that, im certain
positions, contrast in terms of subject emphasis. One of the forms (the stripped) emphasizes the subject, while the other (the full form) does not. This contrast elaborates even
further the placement of the emphasis.

a disjunctive pronoun.

di can be placed between the subject and the finite verb in order to mark an emphasis
which stresses the action of the verb. This construction cannot be used when there is a
pre-verb object or when the verb is reduplicated for verb-emphasis. This is used most
frequently in narrative constructions (4.54) and with the second section of a compoundparallel sentence using di as a connector (12.121(a)).
bukanak kati esukey di kumanje ‘the people of the village knew’
B. External E/S
4. Contingent (C), (external, precise, emphasis): The contingent suffix marks a verb
as a prior condition or state. It functions in conditional sentences, in certain interjections,
and in tying together a series of contingent acts describing how something is done. The
contingent suffix never appears in the past, even when tense is indicated by a time
locative.
ucamom ja paniseniebeANDSYNTAXThe two types contrast nicely in folktales and narrations. Here the description of
events takes the unmarked, or narrative form; an event simply leads to the next. Conversations, events that stand out, and statements describing the general scene or situation,
however, invariably take either NE or VE markings.
The simple subordinate marker can be used in either situation. When it describes
events it is in free variation with the unmarked narrative; when it describes the scene, etc.,
it is in free variation with the noun emphasis. A short exert would be:
funak fakon atiom nabopa:mbonco:bon‘one day my brother sent me to Tiobon’This is the opening sentence stating the topic. The verb -bop receives verb emphasis.","[25, 26, 27]"
"5.216 Directive: When used in verb constructions the suffix -um (already seen as a
noun derivative (5.113)) relates the verb directly with a stated complement. Depending
on the context the relationship can be glossed as ‘by way of’, ‘because of’ or ‘by means of’.
A number of examples contrasting the presence of -um with its absence should make its5.22 UNPRODUCTIVE‘go out via that way’where the latter can be rephrased by substituting the preposition
(9.4(£)) for the -um:
pur bajam bobajam‘by way of’peniribenum uja:maw wola‘cut starting with the neck (by way of)(mo or yo, cf. 8(#-1)). Hence the gloss “because of’.
‘because of this (what you said/did) I like you’
(ni+-maj-++um--i-+-m,I-like-dir-you-SS)A rather specialized use of -um appears in comparative phrases using -fan ‘be more’
(11.142) where what is being compared precedes:
aw nufalenfalen bare inje ifanume ‘you are old, but I am more so’
Compare:‘I am older than you’5.217 The suffix -ali, or -eli, always has the sense ‘be early’.
finki penuwepoli
‘this year you'll cultivate early’.
5.218 Negative: The suffix -ati or -arti forms a negative. It is used primarily with
infinitives, most finite constructions taking the negative inflectional marker instead.
Examples: -baj ‘have’ gives -bajet] ‘not to have, be in mourning’; -lak ‘start cooking’
gives -loketi ‘refuse to cook’, etc.

"‘The alternation of consonants (or nasal plus consonants) with vowels gives the language a
‘cut and dried’ feeling that is especially noticeable to English speakers accustomed to a fair
amount of consonant clustering and to extensive diphthongization.
The juxtaposition of vowels brought about by morphemic processes leads either to
assimilation, to elision, or to the maintenance of each vowel’s syllabic independence. The
morphemic juxtapositions of consonants (outside of N plus C, where the N always
assimilates) invariably leads to consonant reduction or separation. The avoidance of
consonant clustering is so basic that in rapid speech these morphophonemic mechanisms
function across word boundaries.
Vowel harmony is based on the contrast of tense versus lax. This distinction permeates
the entire word affecting, albeit only allophonically, the consonants as well as the vowels.
When tense and lax words are compared one against the other the contrast is so great that
one’s immediate impression is that they represent the sound systems of two unrelated
languages.",[11]

12.114 Single complements — Infinitives: When an infinitive, or an infinitive phrase,
is placed as a post-verb complement, a construction functionally similar to a two-verb
string
is formed (12.12). A construction of this type permits the use of auxiliary verbs. In
such cases the infinitive is always the main verb (cf. 12.121 for extensive listing of
auxiliaries).
nimamman furinan>:len ekan do‘I want to eat’
‘he is able to do it’12.115 A simple sentence can take a large variety of different complement combinations. In the following paragraphs some of the more typical ones are described.
A. Two noun phrases (including bound person markers (10.21)) can be related to each
other as direct and indirect object. Since the position varies according to the placement
of emphasis one has to rely on the meaning of the words to determine which object is
which. Thus, according to where the emphasis is placed, the sentence ‘I gave the food to
the goat’ can be translated
in Fogny as:
ejamency furlaf nisenefuriaf ejameney nisene
ejameney nisene furiaf
furiaf nisene ejamencynisene furlaf ejameney
nisene sjameney furiafIf there is a possibility of ambiguity, an informant will always place the direct object
next to the verb when both objects appear on the same side.
nisene akambanaw ajana
,
—
ajana akambanaw nisene } ey
eeIf the objects straddle the verb one has to rely on the general context to differentiate one
from the other. The sentence
akambanaw nisene ajanaw
can be glossed: ‘I gave the Boy to the girl’ or ‘I gave the girl to the Boy’.
Io!","[69, 70]"
"|10.11 Noun Crass MARKERS
The entire concord marker is prefixed directly onto the verb theme. As with adjectives
(7.3), markers of the form Ca prefix as Cu. Verbs in concord with class 1 nouns prefix
the 3rd person singular form (10.12). In rapid speech when the regent noun or its substitute directly precedes the verb, class markers of the form V can optionally be dropped.

The bound personal pronouns are:

jiku-ist person singular
2nd person singular
3rd person singular
1st person plural exclusive—_—s rst person plural inclusive

The alternation of the two allomorphs of the singular and 1st person plural prefixesis
morphologically determined. The two sets are both in complementary distribution and
in contrast.
Complementary distribution: The full form (i.e., ni-, na-, etc.) is used with the initial
verb of a simple sentence and with the initial verb of both sections of a compoundsentence when the verb is neither contingent (4.533 (4)) mor negative (4.532(A)), and
when it does not take a second position prefix (10.4) or the verbal preclitic connectives

is used.
}
Contrast: The stripped form may substitute for the full form. Depending on the
context this transformation indicates an imperative (4.57), an interrogative (4.74), or the
the fact that emphasis is placed on the subject (4.533(4)).
utiger fugolaf
‘you broke the stick’ or ‘did you break the stick?’ or
‘break the stick’
nutiger fugolaf
‘you broke the stick’ (narrative construction (4.54)).
When the contingent marker (ja) appears in parallel compound construction (12.151
(a)) the full form is used:
|
‘if you have time, then come’
nubaj> ja nujolThe full form, when used in this situation and when used to mark the second section of a
compound sentence, becomes.the functional equivalent of di-+ marker. Thus in the
above example if the 3rd person plural should substitute for the 2nd person singular we
would have:
di kubaj> ja di kujol
‘if they have time then let them come’
When taking the 1st person plural inclusive, the defective verb -en> ‘exist’ (4.581(B))
infixes the suffix -al between en and 9:
wala nonaloe‘we (incl) are’ (nu .. . al -+ end + &)10.13 PLURAL CONCORD WITH SINGULAR REGENTS
When a bound verb subject referent is the plural alternate of its singular regent, asecond noun is implied as interacting with the regent. The understood noun can optionally be placed as a verb object complement introduced by the connective di (9.4(D)).
emunguney silak> ejaw

10.3 MOOD10.31 TENSE
10.311 The future and the future in the past (F and FP) are marked by pan-~ pi
when positive and le-~ let- when negative. pan-, le- and let- are second position prefixes,
whereas
pi is a preclitic.
The common distribution of the positive alternates is: pi obligatory
for relative
clauses;
pan- elsewhere.
When pi joins with the relative object Can- it forms the preclitic Capi or Campi, and
when it joins with the relative subject Ca- it forms the prefix Capi-. Since
the object
relative variant Capi is identical with the subject relative, the context (semantic
and
formal) must be relied upon to differentiate the two.

g2Urheberrechtlich geschitztes MaterialMORPHOLOGYANDSYNTAXOne Bignona informant refused to accept Capi- as a subject relative. According to him,
in order to form a future subject relative, a complement phrase using the seminominal be
(9.3) as a proximate future must be used in combination with the auxiliary -jaw ‘go’
marked as habitual.
anilaw aje mi bepos
‘the child who will wash’ (or literally: ‘the child
who will always go to wash’)
The alternate pi may substitute for pan- when the verb is preceded by its complement.
This shifts the emphasis to the complement (4.56).

tate pjregum‘I will speak here’pa pirin
‘now it (the time) arrives’
The distribution of le- and let- is morphophonemically determined (3.7). Relative clauses
cannot take this morpheme. This is due to the alternate role of le- and let- as non-concord
-modifiers (11.A). Thus the following phrases are structurally the juxtaposition of two nouns
phrases (4.721):
sijamenas le sankubuj mi
‘the goats are not the ones they killed’
sijamenas le sapikubuj mi
‘the goats are not the ones they will kill’
anilaw let apos mi
‘the child is not the one who washes’
A construction identical to those used for the indirect future subject relative must be used
in order to express future negative:
sijamenas sankujerit mi bebuj ‘the goats which they will not kill’ (i.e. ‘the goats
which they never go to kill’)
anilaw ajerit mi bepos
‘the child who will not wash’ (i.e. ‘the child who
never goes to wash’)10.312 The past absolute (PA) is always marked with the first position suffix -e:n.

Both subject and object relative constructions, either with or without the regent noun,
have the same distribution as other noun phrases (4.3). It is the relative phrases, especially
the object relatives, that turn basically simple sentences into complex structures. This is
particularly true when two relative phrases appear in a single sentence.
A relative phrase consists of a single finite verb, or a verb string, plus optional complement(s) and adverb. The initial verb can mark for tense and mode. The only permissible
syntactic markers are the simple subordinate and noun emphasis. From available evidence,
subsequent verbs do not take mood markers.
When used in neutral theme adjective constructions (7.37) the subject relative construction can optionally take a definite article.
If two relative phrases appear in the same sentence they tend to be independent members of the same noun phrase. There is no reason, however, why one relative phrase
could not be ‘built’ into another, either as a complement or as a subject.bala:b bagilene

The relative phrase functions here as a place locative: at-hut-the where-theydig-SS they-go-around like-this; mah is an adverb which is always accompanied
with a gesture. The relationship of delamaney ‘at the hut’ and tankuwokum
‘where they dug’ presents a problem. From one point of view they can be
thought ofas making up a single locative phrase. By reversing their position
and reducing tankuwokum to ta:te ‘here’ we have a simple locative phrase:
ta:te delampaney ‘here at the hut’ (cf. locative phrases 9.21). Another similar
interpretation would have the two join into a ‘reduced’ genitive phrase (9.12):
delampaney: (yeti) tankuwokum, which is similar to delampaney yeti ta:te.
Otherwise they could be thought of as separate complements, one the immediate constituent of the other.

"GS4.713 Relative Construction: The basic RELATIVE CONSTRUCTION consists of two verbs
placed so that the subject or complement of one (the subordinate verb) becomes an
integral part of a noun phrase that acts as the subject or complement of the other (the
main verb). There are, therefore, four possible arrangements:The complement of the main verb acts as the complement of the subordinate.

jat ‘today’ and -om the bound object ‘me’.
Another important complement is the infinitive or infinitive phrase that permits the
expression of a variety of aspects and tense nuances. In such cases the auxiliary or supporting verb is finite and the main verb is the complement infinitive. A construction of this
type is functionally equivalent to a two-member verb string (4.712).nijaw esend bekori

"The last example appeared in phrase final position where the use of -a ~ -al is in free
variation. In the recording, the -al of yololal was particularly clear.
(Part of this text appears in the appendix.)
Other evidence comes from Weiss(p. 421) and from Kennedy (personal communication).5
Weiss has this to say: ‘lorsqu’il s’agit seulement de deux personnes, on dit ola au lieu de
olal. Ex: ola kugaba ola: nous deux’. Kennedy was kind enough to furnish me with the
following: “The dual inclusive plural certainly exists and is often used, but (the informant)
consistently insisted that the more common -al form can always be used in its place even
“The neighboring dialect of Kwatay has a very distinct first person dual-plural contrast. It is formally
distinct from the Diola version. For example:
inclusive plural:UuMNe, U-inclusive dual
wane, Wa*Since the MSS has gone to press there has been no further evidence on the survival of a dual
inclusive in Fogny. This is with the exception
of one Sindian informant who contrasts a disjunctive
subject/object dual-trial inclusive with a plural inclusive.wula jup ‘we are many’
wala kugaba, kufe:gir ‘we two, three’This contrast does not extend to person markers nor to any other forms. In the Buluf speech
of
Tendouk the dual is fully operative:dual: >/a> -ola
plural: slal> ->lal + t vy? ola: +C69A GRAMMAROF DIOLA-FOGNYwhen only two persons are involved. Ex. ola kugaba ola he (the informant)
accepted, but
more than once said that olal kugaba olal is equally correct.
. . . When I asked him to translate ‘at our house’ . . . he first of all would only allow
sindeolal but later changed his mind and said that two people could say sindeola.’
(Kennedy’s informant was about 35 years old.)
The subject/object class form C> (7.21) can be used, in contrast with the disjunctive
possessive (7.35), a8 a weak possessive paralleling the personal markers. Since there is
seldom, if ever, clear junction between the noun and the Co form, the latter
can be
considered as a ‘postclitic’,
karesuy>
‘its name’ (kares y> (3.42))
7.14 DISTRIBUTIVE NouN FORMATION
A distributive noun can be formed by reduplicating completely a neutral theme plus
its noun class marker. Such forms take neither definite articles nor bound possessives. A
distributive may be positive or negative depending upon the verb with which it is associated.

‘I have nothing’ (w-af ‘thing’)
nababaj wafowaf

7.2 PRONOUNS
7.21 Supyect/Osyect PRONOUNS
7.211 All of the personal pronouns, except the two 3rd persons, are independent
themes. The 3rd persons are based on the concord pronoun Co (7.212).
inje
1st person singular (‘I, me’)
aw
2nd person singular (‘you’)
9
3rd person singular (‘he, him’)
uli
1st person plural exclusive (‘we, us’)
wala ~ walal
1st person plural inclusive (‘we all, us’)* (3.8)
muyu ~ muyul
and person plural
ko ~ buko
3rd person plural
The archaic buko (cf. note 1 (7.111(A)) is used quite as frequently as ko.
‘I don’t know them’
inje imanjut buk>
‘you (sg) gave birth to us (excl)’
uli aw uwaluli(us you you-give-birth-us)‘you (pl) will know me’ (you F-you-know me)
‘he and we (incl) didn’t see them’
7.212 The subject/object pronoun consists of the noun class marker plus > (joined
together with appropriate assimilation (3.21)). This concord pronoun (except class 2) can
also be used as a noun possessive marker (7.132) and, under certain circumstances, as a
bound verb complement (4.52).

79°Eléments sous droits d'auteurMORPHOLOGYANDSYNTAX7.22 INTERROGATIVE PRONOUNS7.221 There are three interchangeable variants to the interrogative pronoun: Cey ~
Cay ~ Cay ma. The forms Cey and Cay can be followed, for emphasis, by the invariant
form amban, which, when used independently, has the meaning of ‘why?’.
These interrogative forms, which are class bound, should be contrasted with the general
seminominal interrogative wa (7.62).
apitem ta:tu ay
‘who is chopping there?”
bukey nujuke
‘whom did you see?”
umu ay amban
‘who is this?’
yantomi yay ma
‘what is that (class 3) which is there?’
7.222 The combination of the general pronoun Co and the interrogative Cey produces
an interrogative locative pronoun CoCey which is always glossed as ‘where is it? (etc.)’.","[48, 49, 50]"
"PSTAND‘and how is one to get out of this?’ (then is-this towardsto-make how?)B. When the form -gno takes an object complement it glosses as ‘be like’, otherwise it
serves as an emphatic version of -em ‘be’. It frequently appears with the independent
concord m- (4.4) in the formation of a unique type of phrase that emphasizes the validity
of an antecedent statement.

In order to maintain the general V(N)C pattern, whenever two consonants come together
one of two processes come into play, viz., consonant reduction and consonant separation.
Different grammatical situations call for one or the other.

In normal speech a number of morphophonemic processes operate between words. Of
these, consonant loss, consonant separation, nasal and vowel assimilation, and r ~~ d and
V ~~ VI alternations are the most important. In each case the general morphophonemic‘going to run’
‘Tran’rules apply.","[17, 18]"
"5.5 COMPOUND SECONDARY NEUTRAL THEMES
Very rarely nominal and verbal secondary themes are formed by compounding. The common pattern is: theme + noun class marker + theme. For example: -jaw ‘go’ plus the
noun class marker bu plus the theme -nar join the form -jabunar as in ajabunar ‘voyager,
stranger’, where bunar, taken separately, glosses as ‘road, path’. Thus the literal gloss:
‘one who goes on the road’.
In one case the compound is made up of two themes separated by the phoneme /: -n
‘being’ and -fan gives -nifan as in anifan ‘old man, elder’. And in yet another instance the
compound is made up of a genitive particle (4.343) plusa noun class marker + seminominal
(4.37): -atl ‘of’, ka- noun class marker, and -j>m as kajom ‘tomorrow’ give: fatikajom
‘next morning’, or, ‘literally, ‘of tomorrow’.
Finally, the verb theme -bonket ‘pardon’ is considered by folk-etymology to consist of a
wo-theme compound: -bom ‘dance’-+ -ket ‘die’ and thus literally ‘dance to death’.
Structurally it seems more likely that the form consists of the primary theme -bonk (no
recorded gloss) plus the verbalizer -et (5.223).",[39]

7.116Noun class alternation:A. The alternation of augmentative and diminutive pairs and the Class 13 (ba-) diminu-tive collective produces, with most nouns assigned to a singular-plural set, the following
type of paradigm:

When applied to persons the augmentative alternations have a pejorative connotation.
In cases where a theme, by using more than one prefix pair, has several meanings,
the
diminutive-augmentative alternations are limited. For example, the theme -bo:r can beused
with a class pair 9/8 to mean ‘tree/trees’, and with 3/4 or 5/6 to mean ‘large stick’

or ‘broken-off branch’ (singular or plural). In this instance the alternations produce only:

concerned with the language of the Diola (Dyola, Jola) people living near the
Casamance River in the region of Senegal historically known as the Basse-Casamance.
The study looks specifically at the important dialect Fogny, which can be thought
of asvariants of ‘standard’ Diola. At the time of the monograph’s publication, the
Fogny dialect was used by approximately 85,000 native speakers in the area around
Bignona, Senegal, and was understood by practically all Diola people. This grammar presents a descriptive study of the dialect covering phonology, morphology
and syntax.","[86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92]"

12.152 Tense and contingency:
A. Two sentences can be drawn together to indicate tense contrasts. The four tense
markers and the past subordinate, with or without the support of connectives, serve to
indicate these relationships.
The following juxtapositions occur:ANTERIOR SENTENCE § POSTERIOR SENTENCE
aorist
future, past subordinate +- orut (not yet)
past absolute
aorist
remote past
aorist
past subordinate
aorist, future
If the past subordinate
is marked for tense (either past absolute or remote past) the
posterior phrase takes the same tense markings.
Examples: (the two sentences are separated by a comma (,) )
ani kaporak kep kugore , panel> ‘(when) the dust alone touches him, he will fall’
nipurulopur dakar , aw barokorut di sidi ‘I left Dakar, before you had started
working with Sidi’ (you PS-work-not yet)
sunken nibaje: mbaj bakorj , ner pop nibabaj ‘last year I had money, now also I (still
have (it))’
sunken iyabut ani eleter yoli , nibopeznule:nibap sife:gir ‘last year I received no
letter from you, (even though) I had sent you three’ (posterior sentence pre-cedes) (ni+-bon-+-e:n ... e:n-+-uld+-i-+bop, I-sent-RP-ts-youVE)

types occur:
CONDITIONSENTENCEaorist
past absoluteRESULTANTSENTENCEfuture
future, past hypothetical,past subordinate + past absolute
remote past
future, past hypothetical
contingency
aorist, future
The condition sentence is introduced with an adverb indicating hypotheticalness. If the
general context implies a conditional relationship, the adverb becomes optional. At no
time does a contingency construction take this modifier. A conditional sentence cannot
be marked for verb emphasis.

c. In extended discourse describing how something is done, a series of contingent acts
are linked by repeated use of the contingent marker. The rough gloss is something like this
‘when (if)... then this... then this . . . etc.’ It is used to link two thoughts, whether or
not these two thoughts are formally related via two separate sentences, via the main verb
and relative clause, or via main verb and complement. The following excerpt from a text
describing customary procedure at a funeral will illustrate its use.1. fa

A: now when-F-they-come-SS they-carry-C. Sentence B: they-arrive-from.
2 consists of the first section of a verb string with the first ‘thought’ being: you-kill-C it, and the second: mah ‘like this’. mah, an adverb always accompanied by a gesture, can
be thought of as marking a shift from talk to gesture.
IIoMORPHOLOGYANDSYNTAX3 consists of the second section of the verb string introduced
by the connective man
plus another verb string. (‘The over-all structure of 2. and 3. must be considered as a
compound consisting of two verb strings.)
In 4 ja links a relative time locative to the main verb string.
(Translation: ‘When they arrived from carrying (the corpse) you will kill it (a cow?)
so that you (can) give them (meat) which they go and roast. When the corpse
is put
down, after they have finished eating, you will take a cloth and cover (it).)
p. The verb connector man (12.123(A)) can be used as a conjunction with the glosses
‘before, as soon as, already’ to mark tense contrast. The verb introduced by man is
marked for noun emphasis and is optionally followed by the completive auxiliary -ban
(12.121(A)). When the verb is marked for the remote past, noun emphasis becomes
optional, and when it is marked for the past absolute, the completive is obligatory.

time locative complement.

SYNTAXAGRAMMAROFMORPHOLOGYDIOLA-FOGNYSuperimposed on the core paradigm are three rows that take into account the presence
and absence of the external syntactic markers, viz. contingent and past subordinate
(which are mutually exclusive). The past-subordinate combines with only three tenses:
the aorist, the past absolute and the remote past; the contingent,which defines its owntense as present-future, combines with none.
REMARKS concerning TABLE I
A. ‘The emphatic and the habitual can co-occur in only one construction, the negative
contingent:
mbanarerit ja‘that if he should never take’This form was not accepted by my Sindian informant.
B. The positive indicative forms of the aorist, the absolute past and the remote past,
can appear without E/S markers only in limited circumstances. In such circumstancesthey can be considered as neutral with respect to emphasis and subordination (4.54).
c. In order to specify a habitual contrast in constructions taking the future, the past
hypothetical, the past subordinate, the emphatic (except for a. above) or the positive
contingent, it is necessary to use the frequentive auxiliary -men ‘be full’ (12.121). This is
similarly true for constructions taking the negative ‘not yet’. For example:
panimen burok
‘I will be working continuously; I will be full of work’
bamener irok iban inje bo:t ‘having finished working continuously, I am going home’
(PS-full I-work I-finish I go-home)
imenorut burok
‘I haven’tyet continuously worked; I haven’t had yet enough work’
The entire paradigm expressed in Table 1 is marked as active (i.e. — passive) and contrasts against the passive. When the subject is inanimate the entire paradigm may be
transformed to the passive mode by suffixing the marker -i in the appropriate position.
The passive cannot combine with noun emphasis -e and thus must use, in an immediatesubordinate construction, the simple subordinate mi. When the subject is personal the
paradigm becomes greatly restricted. This can be seen in Table 2 which has been
written for the rst person in the passive mode. It must be noted that outside aorist and
contingent constructions the use of the passive was considered forced or unnatural by my
informants. In more complicated constructions it was invariably mistaken for the 2nd
person singular marker (10.21) which is identical in shape and in position.
4.56 ‘THE Co-OCCURRENCE OF Moop Markers: VIEWED SYNTACTICALLY
A certain overlap of function becomes apparent if we consider the degree to which the
general Emphasis/Subordination markers can co-occur with the Tense and Mode markers:

relative clausesANDSYNTAXA glance at Table 3 shows that the future (also the future in the past and the past hypothetical), the emphatic and the negative fall together by combining with the general E/S
(the simple subordinate) only in relative clauses. In contrast, the past absolute (and the
remote past) combines with all three, and the habitual and passive with two.8 The lack of
co-occurrence on the part of the former group invites two interpretations: viz., any verb
taking one of these three mood markers and not appearing in a relative clause either is
neutral, or defines its own emphasis-subordination. The latter contention seems the
correct one. There are two alternates for the future: pan-, pi (10.311) and three for the
emphatic: mambi, mbi--~bi- (10.324). In both cases the former alternate (pan- and
mambi) is considered stronger than the latter. This permits a direct parallel with the
immediate E/S markers. The weak version is functionally equivalent to the noun emphasis
and the strong version is functionally equivalent to verb emphasis. The weak version of
the future, apart from relative clauses, is accepted, however, only when a complement
precedes, and, according to one Bignona informant, only when the complement is alocative demonstrative and the verb is impersonal or in the 1st person. Other informants,

mambijaw barbaplacement,accepted a wider variety of constructions‘I went there’
‘T will go there’
‘I should go there’contrasts with:barba nije
ba:ba pijawba:ba mbijaw
As with verbs marked for immediate E/S, considerable supplementary variation can be
achieved by varying the position of the complement (possible only with the emphatic) and
by using a disjunctive subject pronoun (cf. 4.533(A) for a complete paradigm).
The negative markers do not have strong and weak alternates and thus, in order to
express varying shades of emphasis, must rely entirely on complement positioning and
on the presence or absence of disjunctive subjects. For the sake of structure, however, it
will be convenient to consider the negative as defining its own E/S which, if meaning is
taken into account, must surely be emphasis rather than subordination.
If the above thesis holds, we can go on to say that the second group (past absolute,
habitual, passive, etc.) are entirely neutral with respect to emphasis/subordination. They
must rely on appropriate E/S marking for ‘syntactic’ placement.
This discussion suggests a scale that would group together, in terms of syntactic involvement, all the tense, mode and E/S markers. Using Sapir’s (1921:107-8) distinction
8 The inability of the habitual and the passive to co-occur with the noun emphasis marker poses a
problem that is more formal than functional. Whenever a passive or the habitual enter a frame
calling for the noun emphasis, the latter is always replaced by the simple subordinate:bey nuje
bey nuje midakar nibope
dakar nibopi mi‘where were you?’ (nu-+jaw-}-€ you-go-NE)
‘where did you habitually go?’ (you-go-hab-SS)‘I sent to Dakar’
‘I was sent to Dakar’® The latter forms are obligatorily used in relative clauses, a fact that certainly stresses their inherent
weakness.","[27, 28, 29]"
"10.323 The passive (pas) is marked by the suffix -i.

waf warieriti

10.324 The emphatic (emph) is marked with the prefix mbi- ~ bi- or, in its full form,
the preclitic mambi. This latter is actually a combination of the verb connective man
(12.123(A)) and bi. The shorter forms combine with the future marker pan- and the
negative imperative marker takun- to form pambi- and takumbi- respectively, and with
the object relative preclitic Can- to form Cambi. The alternate bi is never used with the

2. Four of the verbs that begin with ¢ (or €:) and that have special prefix assimilation
(3.221) indicate verb emphasis by reduplicating the entire form, including the concord

with -€:t ‘ought, go home’.

-en ‘say’,
and -eken ‘have in hand’. In these cases the initial vowel of the reduplicated

mainly with themes referring to tieing, closing, covering, etc. Thus -lo:p ‘have cord tied
around the neck’ gives -lo:pul ‘untie cord from around neck, undress’, -bab ‘close’ gives
-babul ‘open’, and -fim ‘be turned over’ gives -fimul ‘uncover’ (compare -fimen ‘cover’)
A number of other forms also use the reversive. In these cases, however, the semantic
link between the primary and the secondary themes is not always clear. For example,
~bat ‘swear by God’ gives -batul ‘remove a curse’ and -paj ‘trim stick with a blade’ gives
-pajul ‘separate out from a group of similar objects’.
5.222 Iterative: In a fair number of instances, but by no means universally, a secondary derivative can be formed by suffixing either -en or -2r to a reduplicated primary
theme. These forms usually have some type of durative, repetitive, or emphatic meaning
which is only partially predictable from the root. Those taking -en are usually transitive;
those taking -or are usually intransitive.
From -kob ‘wait for s.o.’ we have -kokoben ‘yearn, long for’, from -lob talk, scandalize’,we have -lalobor ‘be crazy’. The verb -tey ‘run’ can take either the -en or the -or: -teteyen
‘cause to run (hard and continuously)’, -teteyor ‘run from left to right, disentangle’.
5.223 Verbalizer: ‘The suffix -et, wherever it appears, always defines a theme as being a
verb. With one semantic realm the use of the verbalizer is entirely productive. A verb
meaning ‘to gather or harvest a fruit, vegetable, fish, etc. in large quantities (usually for
commercial purposes)’ can be formed by suffixing -et to the name of the produce in
question. The noun bana (ba-+-na) ‘type of small fish’ gives -neet ‘to catch bana with a
special type of net’; funane (pl. kunene) ‘banana’ gives -neneet ‘gather lots of bananas’,

The imperative, which is used as an interjection, asserts a command. It has a positive
and negative form and is used with all the persons and classes. ‘The positive form consists
only of a verb theme plus a concord or bound personal subject. The latter, when feasible,
is always stripped (4.51). Some speakers drop the second singular and plural subjects.
The negative consists of a special prefix which can combine with the emphatic (4.532(D))
to indicate an indefinite future imperative.jol, ujol‘come!’ajaw

ajaburunaw ajaw ri ‘let the stranger go and eat’B, The remaining markers, all of which have relational functions, are either precise or
general. Since the precise markers describe a clear semantic relationship (past subordinate, contingency) it seems reasonable to consider them as slightly more concrete than the
general markers which define, in a rather vague way, simple emphasis or subordination
without explaining the kind.(pan-) — (mbi)(mi)
Cc8 | Ce)The defective verb -e:t ‘ought’ (4.581(D)) can be used as an auxiliary to emphasize the
positive imperative. Frequently the Wolof loan -ware ‘ought’ or the modifier fo~foke
(from the Fr. ‘faut’ in the expression ‘il faut que’) is used in its stead.

4.58 DEFECTIVE VERBS
4.581
Four verbs, all using the special method of prefix assimilation (3.221), have
limited and specialized functions.
a. The most important defective -em ‘be’ serves in progressive constructions, in attributives, and to state existence. Simple juxtaposition (4.721) to a certain extent parallels
-em in performing these functions. -em, however, being finite has the advantage of taking
a number of the inflectional verb affixes, especially tense and the simple subordinate
markers, which give it greater semantic flexibility.
burok nen di bo
‘T am working’ (work J-am and it) (nen di<nem di)
en dere
‘T am within’2 ajola nam
nilalan manemeinNE
(-€)
The most striking contrast is between the future and the past absolute markers, a contrast that fits perfectly with their relative syntactic involvement.
Further, the emphatic in its full form mambi (actually a combination of the connective
man -+ bi) becomes a preclitic:
mambi bakari acamom
‘so that B. should pay me’‘c’est un Diola’ (Wss) (he Diola he-is)
‘I return as I was (before) (I-return and-I-am-PA:
man-+i--em+tern)The defective -em takes a special demonstrative suffix of the form -am plus one of the
demonstrative place forms (-e, -a etc. (6.11)). This suffix is reserved for a number of set
expressions,
ajaburun anamamu
‘the stranger who is like this’ (an-+-at+em-+am-+u personwho-is-this)mba mame betskan bu42SYNTAXtakumbugor
‘don’t let me see you touch’
‘Two verbs may be combined in an imperative statement. In such cases the second verbA. Mode and tense have been ranked with respect to the number of general E/S markers
with which they can co-occur: the fewer they accept, the greater their syntactic involvement.",[30]
"AND‘I had him break open peanuts’ (I-break-caus-him-VE)5.212 Descriptive-Reflexive: The suffix -2 can be thought of as a descriptive (suggesting a passive) or as a ‘weak’ reflexive (in contrast to the strong reflexive (5.21 3)). In most,if not all cases the verb either describes a state or indicates the subject as acting on itself
1 Thomas(1959:590) suggests the correspondence.
SIAGRAMMAROFDIOLA-FOGNYMORPHOLOGYwithout relation to an object. In the former context the reflexive sense is absent; in the
latter it is present, but never emphasized. Because in these circumstances no object is
permissible, the descriptive reflexive, in exact reverse of the causative, can be taken as an
ntransitive former, especially when it is suffixed to a transitive theme.nab>bal eliwey‘he roasted the meat’nabolobolo‘he is burnt, he burnt himself’Contrast:
lako tarte‘sit (yourself) here, be seated’laken jipilaj tacte‘sit the baby (down) here’with:
The suffix -> has, however, a semantic reference that does not preclude its use in
transitive constructions. Thus the verb -rarn ‘drink’ becomes -rarn> ‘desire, crave’, or
literally, ‘drink self’, and is always used as a transitive:
buluteb fan bo nirarnoraino‘I even crave millet’There are many derivative forms using the reflexive-descriptive that show (as in the case
of -rarnd) rather roundabout relationships to their primary theme. In all such examples
the basic subject and/or descriptive reference is nevertheless in play. For example, -jam
‘sense, hear’ gives -jam> ‘be celebrated’ or, literally, ‘hear of self (from the tongues of
others), be heard of’ and -cim ‘sing’ gives -cimo ‘cough’, literally ‘sing to self’, etc.
5.213 Strong reflexive: The suffix -oro always indicates a clear reflexive differing from
-> (qua reflexive) in terms of emphasis. Thus -pos ‘wash sth’ gives:
niposopos> iban‘I have finished washing (self)where the fact of ‘self washing’ is not really under consideration, in contrast to:
nipossroposora iban‘I have finished washing myself’5.214 Reciprocal: The suffix -or indicates that two or more actors act together or
reciprocally. Reciprocal themes may be either transitive or intransitive. The verb -jim
‘forget s.o.’ gives:
panujimoral‘we will forget each other’ (F-we-forget-recp-incl)and -bo:t ‘grab sth.’:
kubo:tobo:tor= “They (both or all) grabbed for the money’In a number of cases the reciprocity is with respect to subject and object rather than
between two subjects:
esarmay nilupore‘I hunted the leopard’At other times the idea of reciprocity is rather remote.
becomes -nomor ‘walk in a circle’:di kunomor delampeneyThus,‘and they walk around the hut’.
52-nom‘turn a corner’SYNTAXWith a fair number of forms the ->r indicates a reflexive and not reciprocity. These cases
might be taken as being a reduction of the strong reflexive -2r>. Two examples are: -lako ‘sit
self’ which can also be -lakor and the reflexive of -raw ‘stretch sth’ which is always -rawor.
5.215 ‘The suffix -ulo and its two allomorphs -u and -ul refer to an area other than the
one occupied by the speaker, or other than the one referred to in the discourse. When used
with verbs of motion it indicates that the motion is from a removed area (stated or implied) and towards either the speaker, or the area referred to as immediate (i.e. as ‘here’)
in the discourse. When it is used with other verbs it indicates that the action takes place
at some distance from the speaker or from the area referred to in the discourse.
For example, to indicate that one is to arrive where the speaker is, the ‘towards speaker’
must be used:
penerinu dakar
‘he will arrive at Dakar (speaker at D.)’In contrast we have:
panerin dakar
‘he will arrive at Dakar (speaker NOT
Some other examples are:jify kusofulo bapalum di agamorat D.)’‘J makes (traps) friendship there with A.’niwonkulo:wonk
‘T called him from a place (to here)’
iriloxt bignona
(ni+-ri-- ulo-+ ut) (3.23) ‘I did not eat at Bignona’
Formally, the ‘towards speaker’ derivative stands apart form all other derivative markers.

‘T went out early’ (I-leave-e-PA-NE)
nipureu mi
‘T went out habitually from’ (I-leave-hab-ts-SS)
2. In infinitives (7.6) the addition of this marker to one syllable themes does not change
the infinitive marker from class 3 to class 7 (e- > ka-), as do other derivatives:cf, ebajThe difference comes out clearly in the French glosses, viz, kapos> ‘se laver’ versus
kaposoro ‘se laver lui-méme’.
At times the contrast is more than one of simple emphasis, with the respective markers
each giving the primary theme a distinct meaning. For example: -buj ‘kill’ becomes:
~bujo ‘be wounded, wound self’ in contrast to: ‘-bujoro ‘kill self’.","[34, 35]"

vowel assimilation (3.2), consonant separation (3.42), reduction (3.41), and loss (3.5) and
nasal assimilation (3.3). There is also an alternation between r and d (3.6) and a set of
phonemically regulated morpheme alternates (3.7). Most of these processes operate
between words (3.8). Finally, there is evidence for a non-operative process of consonantaddition (3.9).
3.1VowErLHarmonyThe outstanding feature of Fogny morpho-phonemics is a system of vowel harmony
where the ten (twenty if length is considered) vowels divide into two mutually exclusive sets
that are distinguished by the opposition of tense vs. lax.1 There are no ‘neutral’ vowels.?

invariant with respect to general tongue position:

-rork/-rork
bu-/bu-‘make’
‘load’
noun class prefix g (4.2 et seq.)‘Themes that are variable with respect to vowel harmony are always lax in isolation.
Further, the only morphemes that are invariably lax are those with which tense morphemes cannot combine. These two facts suggest: a. morphemes are basically eithertense or lax; and b. tense vowels control harmony. A lax vowel in the presence of a tense
vowel becomes tense. Therefore, remembering that general position is invariant, we have
the following very simple rules:
i ++ tense vowel

j and u vs. U) where I was unable to detect any significant difference in height.
2 A neutral vowel would be one that could occur in both sets (cf. Greenberg 1963:34). The Fognysystem contrasts with the Huluf dialect of Diola (described by Wilson,
vowels are neutral (a, €, 9) and the remaining five divide into two
versus I, U, 4 (these latter are equivalent to Fogny i, u, 9).

unit. Certain verb affixes that are loosely connected to the theme may or may not, depending on the speaker and his rate of talk, respond to vowel harmony.

derivative suffix (5.215) assimilates to its environment. Derivative suffixes (5.) and mood
markers (4.53) of the form -uC and -uC assimilate to back mid and high vowels. Preclitics of the form (N)Ci assimilate when joined directly onto the verb. Verbs beginning
with a assimilate in prefixing, those beginning with € or e: have special assimilation
(3.221), while those beginning with high vowels do not assimilate at all.
When a noun theme consists of a single vowel there is never any suffix assimilation.","[14, 15]"

This particularly complex example breaks down as:
verb: babaj ‘(there) are (impersonal)’
direct object: bukanak kariem pontiter ‘the people who eat potatoes’
indirect object introduced by a preposition: nin kujola:k ‘as the Diola’

than to an antecedent sentence: mankuriem ema:no ‘like this they eat rice’
The entire sentence could be reduced to the simple form:

B. Comparative constructions: The basic comparative construction is: subject (object
being compared) -+- -fan ‘be more’-+ complement (quality of comparison, usually an
infinitive) + complement (object against which the subject is being compared). The
relationship between the two complement objects is essentially that of direct to indirect
object. If the objects of comparison are A and B, and the quality of comparison is X,
then a literal gloss would be: A is more X (than) B.

time and place. There does not seem to be any restriction on where these markers are
placed, though place markers usually stand closer to the verb when they are both placed
on the same side. Time markers never appear between the subject and the verb.ta:te nilakoe kabirin na:nana‘I have always been sitting HERE’ (chanted whileplaying ‘king of the castle’).(here I-sit-NE since always)

mainly with themes referring to tieing, closing, covering, etc. Thus -lo:p ‘have cord tied
around the neck’ gives -lo: pul ‘untie cord from around neck, undress’, -bab ‘close’ gives‘go out via that way’Other examples would be: -ribenMARKERSThe unproductive secondary verb markers are:function clear.
For the verb -pur ‘go out from (sortir) we have:

purum boVERB‘if you have from’545.222 Iterative: In a fair number of instances, but by no means universally, a secondary derivative can be formed by suffixing either -en or -or to a reduplicated primary
theme. These forms usually have some type of durative, repetitive, or emphatic meaning
which is only partially predictable from the root. Those taking -en are usually transitive;
those taking -or are usually intransitive.
From -kob ‘wait for s.o.’ we have -kokoben ‘yearn, long for’, from -lob talk, scandalize’,we have -lolabor ‘be crazy’. The verb -tey ‘run’ can take either the -en or the -or: -teteyen
‘cause to run (hard and continuously)’, -teteyor ‘run from left to right, disentangle’.
5.223 Werbalizer: The suffix -et, wherever it appears, always defines a theme as being a
verb. With one semantic realm the use of the verbalizer is entirely productive. A verb
meaning ‘to gather or harvest a fruit, vegetable, fish, etc. in large quantities (usually for
commercial purposes)’ can be formed by suffixing -et to the name of the produce in
question. The noun bane (ba-+ns) ‘type of small fish’ gives -nset ‘to catch bene with a
special type of net’; funane (pl. kunena) ‘banana’ gives -neneet ‘gather lots of bananas’,
etc.",[37]
"5.3 MULTIPLE DERIVATIVE MARKERS
A derivative suffix can be added as an immediate constituent to a secondary theme in
order to produce a multiple derivative, or what Wintz (p.45) calls a ‘dérivé secondaire’.
There are two common types: theme+ verbal derivative+- nominal derivative to forma noun; theme ++ two (and occasionally more) verbal derivatives to form a verb. In the
former pattern the verbal derivative is almost always the reciprocal -or and occasionally
the reflexive ->:atekora‘boxer’elako:ma ‘seat’(-tek‘hit’)(e+ lak + 2-+ ume)The only unproductive marker to be used in the multiple verbal derivative is the reduplicated iterative (5.222). The meaning is almost always predictable as the sum of the
constituents. Thus -j>j ‘gather, assemble sth’ (-jojen ‘cause to gather’, -j>j> ‘gather self’)
gives -jojoren ‘cause to gather each other’; -kumor ‘hum, grumble, whisper’ gives kunkumen ‘stifle a cry’ and -kunkumend ‘stifle one’s own cries’, etc.
A multiple derivative, formed by the ‘towards speaker’ and the directive, occurs with the
theme -jaw ‘go’. This form, combined with a place locative, glosses as ‘come from’, dakar
najomul> ‘he has come from D.’ (3.51). The directive disengages the subject from the
locative, something not possible if the ‘towards speaker’ derivative appears alone, dakar
nijal> ‘I have come to D. (speaker at D.)’. If an object substitutes for the locative, the
subject and object have the same locality.

THEME FORMATION
In four recorded instances a verb inflectional marker appeared functioning as a derivative
former: the passive suffix -i combines with -wol ‘give birth’ to form kawoli ‘birth (n)’;
the past subordinate (4.533) with -kan ‘make’ to form bakaner ‘finished product’ and the
negative -ut (4.532) to form sumut ‘be sick’. The negative -ut also joins with the theme
-ju ‘be in good health’ to form -ju:t ‘be sick’. This secondary form, however, cannot be
reduplicated even though the status of -ut as a derivative is assured by its position.
Consider the double derivative formation: -ju:talenor ‘pretend to be sick’ in the phrase
aju:talenorerit ‘he never pretends to be sick’, a phrase which would be impossible if -ut
was functioning in its normal capacity as mood marker.","[38, 39]"
