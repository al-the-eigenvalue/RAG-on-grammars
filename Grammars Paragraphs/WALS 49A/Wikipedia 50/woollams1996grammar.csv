Older brother is shooting birds.
In each of the above cases the noun expounding the Object slot refers only to the general
category of items bearing that meaning, and not to any particular instances of the category.
Less elegantly, but more accurately, these clauses could be glossed as 'I am water-fetching'
or 'Brother is bird-shooting', where the object is semantically incorporated into the predicate.
Indeed from a functional viewpoint, such cases could be equally well classified as
intransitive. akin to the cases of noun-incorporation described in §5.5.2. That the objects
above are indeed non-referential is demonstrated by their inability to be modified by
adjectives. noun-classifiers or demonstratives:( 6 . 22)MediIperik*6nda kaka.",[199]
"4. 1 .2 NOUN HEAD
The Head slot of the NP may be expounded by:
a personal pronoun (§4. 1 .2. 1 )an interrogative pronoun (§4.1 .2.2)
an indefinite pronoun phrase (§4. 1 .2.3)
a noun, of which there are a number of subclasses, including common nouns,
identificational nouns (§4. 1 .2.4), locative nouns (§4. 1 .2.5), and nouns derived by
morphological processes (§3.7)
a demonstrative (§4. 1 .2.6)
numerals and certain quantifiers (Sections 4. 1 .3 )
nominalised forms, including nominalised adjectives, whole clauses (§4. 1 .2.7) and
headless relative clauses (§8. 1 .6)4 . 1 .2. 1 PERSONAL PRONOUNS
The personal pronoun system in Karo is formally somewhat asymmetrical, with most but
not all pronouns having both independent and dependent (clitic) forms, as illustrated in Table4. 1 .
The independent pronouns expound the following clause-level slots: subject, predicate of
identificational clause, and object of active clause (except for ia '3 SGIPL ' , which, in the
latter environment, has a special objective form -sa). For example:(4.6)Aku tubuh i Juhar.
Ibornat JuharI was born in Juhar.",[117]

Further afield, similar constructions are described by Siewierska ( 1 984:93 ff.) and
Keenan ( 1 985:273 ff.), drawing upon data from a wide cross-section of language families:
Indo-European (Latin, Classical Greek, Dutch, German, Irish), Finno-Ugric, Altaic,43 Passive verbs lacking active counterparts are found sprinkled in neighbouring languages. Percival
( 198 1 :74) cites such ""defective stems"" in Toba Batak, whilst in Indonesian one finds the passive form
dikarenakan 'caused by' without an active counterpart *mcngarenakan . McGinn (1 982:48) mentions
similar instances for Rejang. A few such cases occur in English as well, for example, 'He was
rumoured/reputed to be a spy' .",[211]

[ull:n]3.3.3 FUNCTIONS
In this description, affixes are classified according to their function. Primarily a distinctionexists between paradigmatic and derivational affixes. Paradigmatic (or inflectional) affixes donot change the lexical identity of the stem to which they are attached. Their function is to fitthe stem for use in a syntactic frame. for example, voice marking for transitive verbs, or
predicative and degree marking for adjectives. By contrast, derivational affixes create new
words; that is, they change the lexical identity of the stem to which they are attached. This
usually involves a change in categorial status (e.g. from noun to verb, or vice versa), but in a
number of cases the resultant form belongs to the same word class as the stem from which it
is derived. For example, the circumfix per-... -en derives collective nouns from other noun
sterns : nini 'grandparent' ---> peminin 'the grandparents' (§3.7.4).
Although derivational affixes are mostly ""inner formations"" and inflectional affixes ""outer
formations"" (Cook 1969: 1 1 9, 1 25), there are cases where the reverse is true, that is, where a
stem containing a paradigmatic affix is further equipped with a derivational affix. For
example, the distributive intransitive verb formative si-... -na, which operates on inflected
transitive verb stems (§3.6.8), and the nominaliser -na, which, when attached to a predicative
adjective stem in a relative clause, marks superlative degree (§3.7.8).
The affixes are now described individually, in categories according to their function: first,
paradigmatic affixes, then derivational affixes deriving transitive verbs, intransitive verbs,
nouns. and finally miscellaneous items. The descriptive format for each affix focuses first on
formal aspects, then on function and meaning. These are exemplified in short lists of usually
single-word examples, but where it is necessary to clarify some special sense of what the
affix conveys, extra context in the form of a phrase or clause is provided. Morpheme breaks
are not indicated as they are felt to be evident from the individual accounts given. Finally,
homophonous affixes belonging to different functional sets are not distinguished from each
other, but where they occur within the same set, they are differentiated by superscript
numbers. An exception to this practice is the regular use of superscript numbers to identifythe five different affixes whose representation is N-.","[52, 53]"
"6.3. 1 .2 EXPONENTS
The Predicate Centre is expounded by a transitive verb stem prefixed with the passive
marker i- (§3 .4. 1 .2). Although it is sometimes dropped by some speakers in informal
contexts, or in situations where other syntactic andlor pragmatic clues exist to define the
clause as passive, this i- prefix can always be attached to the verb when the Agent is in post­
verbal position, that is, when it is manifested by a noun or noun phrase, or independent or
,
enclitic pronoun. The glossing convention '(PASS) is used below to indicate that the
passive prefix has not been realised on a particular verb, but is nevertheless recoverable.
However, when the actor is realised by a pronoun denoting first person singular (aku) or
first person plural inclusive (kira), then the Agent slot is pre-verbal , and expounded by the
proclitic forms ku- 'I' or si- 'we (inclusive) ' ; in such cases the passive prefix i- is
obligatorily absent.
The complete regular passive paradigm for a typical transitive verb pekpek 'to hit' , is
illustrated below, together with English glosses. It should be noted that the rendering of the
latter in the active voice in idiomatic English is simply a reflection of the different functions
which the passive performs in the two languages. This will be pursued in §6.5.

Active clauses in Karo are all monotransitive - that is, there are no cases of dual objects
(one direct, one indirect) in this language.",[197]
"In this chapter the term WORD will be used in the sense o f 'grammatical word' (Pike &
Pike 1977: 1 13; Matthews 1 974:32), as distinct from the notion of 'phonological word'. For
instance, the utterance lrumahtal is a single phonological word, with characteristic stress on
the penultimate syllable (§2. 1 . I . 1 ), but is grammatically a sequence of two elements, rumah
' house' and -ta 'our' , the latter morpheme being a clitic form of the first person plural
(inclusive) pronoun kita. Since the construction rumahta 'our house' (including theaddressee), expounds a noun phrase (§4 . 1 ) analagous to rumah karni 'our house' (excluding
the addressee), it is analysed as consisting of two grammatical words, not one.
CLITICS are a special subset of words; they are monomorphernic, unstressable forms
which never occur freely but are phonologically bound to an adjacent word. As the above
example shows, they affect the stress placement of the word to which they are attached. Karo
has only two sets of clitics:(i)the personal pronoun agentive and possessive forms, ku- , -ku, -ndu, -mu,-naJ-sa, si- and -ta17-agentive clitic pronouris expound clause level slots (§6.3 . 1),whereas possessive clitic pronouns expound the possessive slot of the noun phrase(§4. 1 .4) ;
(ii) the operators nge (§7.4.S.2.9) and me (§7.4.5.3.4) which, upon loss of their vowel
under certain environmental conditions, merge phonologically with an adjacent word.
AFFIXES are similar to clitics, in that they are also phonologically bound forms, but
differ in that their structural domain is restricted to word formation. In the simplest cases,
affixes combine with ROOTS to form words (e.g. baba 'carry' + -en ' (nominaliser:
undergoer) ' = baban 'burden, load'). However, since this resultant construction is itselfcapable of being further affixed to create a verb, as in er- '(verbaliser) , + baban 'load' =1 7 This description is therefore at variance with the analysis by Verhaar (1984a:3,4) of analagous structures
in Indonesian, wherein he classifies clitic pronouns as affixes.",[47]
"3 . 1 TERMINOLOGICAL PREUMINARIES
The complexities inherent in establishing a universal definition of the notion of 'word' are
well-recorded in linguistic literature (Lyons 1 968: 194 ff. ; Pike & Pike 1 977: I l l ) . Even
within the one language, it is often the case that no single criterion or set of criteria can be
applied to identify and define all those structural units ,one wishes to call 'words ' .",[47]
"Such forms are homophonous with, but morphemically distinct from, cases of pe- verb
stems ( § 3 . 5 .3 . 1 ) suffixed with iterative -i (§3 .4.2.2), which involve plurality of the
Undergoer:(3.58)PesusurisidktuaJahenda.",[73]
"In both cases the regular reflexive forms (bana and bangku respectively) are overridden by
the pronoun aku which is retained for special emphasis. Contrastive emphasis may also be
signalled by a change in constituent order. This applies only to passive reflexives, and
involves fronting the Dative-2 phrase over the predicate:(6. 1 44)Man bangku ngekupekpek!to
me
EMPH Lhit
It was myself I hit!

only
(PASS).CAUS.in.order.he
He never gave anybody else any consideration. He only looked after himself.",[220]
"Aside from their usual voice-marking functions (with the passive directed more at actor­
demotion rather than undergoer-promotion - see §6.3.2.4), active and passive also correlate
very highly with imperfective and perfective aspect. at least in certain environments.
However, since aspect is signalled by other (morphological) devices when the surrounding
grammatical conditions dictate the selection of one voice over the other, it is concluded that
aspect marking is a secondary function associated with actives and passives in this language.
As they outnumber actives by more than two to one. and as it is possible to more clearly
define the distributional patterns and meanings of actives than those of passives, it is evident
that passives play a more central role in Karo than they do in many other languages.
Furthermore. given that the passive prefix i- is often dropped (as opposed to the
indispensable active marking prefix N-), it is tempting to conclude that - contrary to the case
for English, for example - the passive is the more basic. unmarked voice, and active is the
marked voice. At this point. however. questions of cross-linguistic comparability arise.
along with the complex issue of whether the Karo passive should in fact be regarded as a true
passive at all. A number of recent studies on transitivity in other Austronesian languages
have claimed that these languages exhibit ""discourse ergativity"" (Hopper 1 983. 1 98 8 ;
Cooreman, Fox & Giv6n 1 984; Verhaar 1 988b), although a response b y Cumming and
Wouk ( 1 987) argues for caution in adopting such terminology for languages which are not
unambiguously ergative at the level of morphology. It is impossible to address such far­
reaching issues here, but in so far as the description provided above might give a better idea
of the fonus and functions associated with actor and undergoer marking in another relatively
unstudied Austronesian language. it is hoped that the Karo data might be of some small use
in assisting in the resolution of some of these problems.",[230]

The term 'possessive' is used here to designate a structural relation of modification of one
NP by another. Although in the majority of cases this modification is accompanied by a
semantic role-structure of possessed-possessor, the semantic relation between the two NPs is
not limited to 'possessive' in the strict sense (see Durie 1 985b: l 09; Verhaar 1 988a:6 ff.). A
number of different semantic relations are expressed by possessive NPs, including:
(i) possession or ownership : property + owner

Although possession in Karo is expressed by means of word order, the language does
possess some vestiges of a case-marking device denoting the kind of semantic relations
described above. As described in §4.2. 13, the genitive marker ni = nu = u occurs with an
NP Complement in certain archaic expressions to expound the Possessive s10t:33(4.207)gedang-gedang u dalin
long-longof roadalong the road (Le. for the length of the road)32This expression is ambiguous. It may refer to the one who is literally our father, or to a male clan mate
whom we should address as bapa, or to the father of somebody to whom we are expressing respect and
solidarity.
3 3 The occurrence of the nasals in the enclitic pronominals -ngku , -ndu , -nra and -na might also be
interpreted as remnants of this genitive marker.","[144, 145, 146, 147]"
"This is analagous to the process of 'subject-raising' as described in transformational
analyses of English and other languages, although in English one has the benefit of case­
marking on pronouns and tense-marking on verbs to support such an analysis. Such features
do not play a part in Karo morphosyntactic organisation,69 but there are three other
grammatical features which provide some corroborative support for the notion that the lower
clause subject can in fact assume a granunatical role in the higher clause:
(i) Reflexivisation
The predicator akap 'think, consider' is frequently found with a complement clause
containing a subject which is coreferential with the agent of akap. For example:(8. 1 40)Kuakap (maka) aJru kalak bujur.
1. think that
I
person honest
I think (that) I am an honest person.",[325]
"PASS.hang.he himselfBut at night while I was asleep he hanged himself.
Such syntactic behaviour points to the strongly nominal origins of such conjunctions, and
is in fact analagous to the situation described for NPs when a noun head is modified by a
Descriptive slot expounded by an independent clause, in which case any personal pronoun
subject of the descriptive clause is 'advanced' and attached in enclitic form to the noun head(§4. 1 .5 .5). For example:
(8.273)ingan leita jumpa
place weinganta>---meetjumpaplace.our meetthe place where we meet, our meeting place
Constructions with janah, dingen, etc. could therefore be classed as a special set of
temporal noun phrases. However, from a functional perspective they do resemble nonnal
conjunctions, in that alternative, regular behaviour is attested in the following circumstances:
(i) when the subject of the subordinate clause is coreferential with the subject of the main
clause, and thus omitted:(8.274)Dingen ngoge
whileaku manACT.read IgaJuh.",[346]
"(PASS).bring tolockup thiefTake that thief to the lockup.that before149
In such cases ndai serves the same function as it does when expounding DET 1 , that is, to
identify a discourse participant which has either recently been referred to or has played a rolein the context of shared experience between speaker and addressee.
Some ambiguity concerning the function of ndai is possible. For example:(4.290)Enggo kabang perik e
already flybirdndai.that beforeHere, ndai could be referring to the time the action occurred (,Those birds flew away a little
while ago' ) or to the birds which had been present in the discourse ( 'Those birds - the oneswe were speaking about earlier - have flown away'). The potential for movement of ndai to
another position in the clause (usually to i mmediate post-predicate position) would
disambiguate the interpretation, in this case by establishing the role of ndai as a temporal
adjunct.","[158, 159]"
"2. 1 . 1 .4 IRREGULAR STRESS
Around ten words have been found which, from a purely synchronic perspective, exhibit
irregular stress placement, nearly always on the final syllable. However, when viewed from
other perspectives, their failure to conform to the regularities of the system described above
may be seen to be systematic:
(i)One case, /bagel [bagel 'like that, thus' is a contraction of preposition plus
demonstrative pronoun /bagi e/ [bagi e], with the stronger phrase stress dominant over
word stress after the process of contraction.",[22]
"3.3.2 FORMS
Karo has more than sixty different morphemes which are realised as affixes. Yet the total
number of different affix fonns in the language is 2 1 . This means that a number of different
morphemes are manifested wholly or partially by the same morphs. For example, as
described in §3.2, the suffix -en represents four different morphemes. It also occurs in a
number of circumfixes: the verbalisers ke-... -en, ter-... -en, si-. . . -en, and the nominalisers
peN-... -en, per-... -en, ke-... -en, kini-. -en. In all cases the suffix alternates between I-en! and
I-n!, according to a regular morphophonemic rule. Rather than repeatedly describing this
..process for each of the morphemes in which such an affix occurs, a single statement is
provided here to account for the allomorphic changes such forms regularly undergo. Any
special variations which pertain only to a particular morpheme are described later, together
with the individual account of that morpheme. Those recurrent fonns for which a general
morphophonemic statement is given are as follows.",[50]

By the time of my second and third visits to the field, I had established a good many
hypotheses about the language as well as acquired a passable fluency in it, such that I was
able to conduct most of my subsequent inquiries monolingually in Karo. On those occasions
I also had the opportunity to travel to a number of different parts of Karoland and do some
preliminary studies on dialect differences. Apart from collecting a substantial number of
publications in the language (see Bibliography), I was able to assemble a large corpus of data
from my observations and recording of speech in a variety of everyday situations.
The aim of this study is to describe the phonological, morphological and syntactic
structures of Karo Batak. In analysing the data I have adopted an eclectic approach rather
than attempt to align myself with any particular theoretical persuasion. Although the general
foundation employed here is structuralist (in many respects identifiable as an attenuated
version of tagmemic analysis, minus the extreme formalism), I have attempted to borrow
insights from other approaches when these seem better suited to describe the facts at hand.
Some issues of theoretical significance have emerged from this study, such as the interplay
between voice and aspect marking in the transitive system of Karo, but I have been motivated
more by the objective of describing and explaining how the structures of Karo work, rather
than attempting to support any particular theoretical position. It is my hope that the
conclusions arrived at in this study may be of some assistance to others wishing to use Karo
for communicative purposes.
For ease of reference, this description is organised into seven chapters as follows: Chapter2 deals with the phonological system, Chapter 3 deals with the morphology, Chapter 4
describes noun phrases and prepositional phrases, Chapter 5 looks at non-transitive clauses,
Chapter 6 describes transitive clauses, Chapter 7 describes aspects of clause-level syntax
common to all clause types, and Chapter 8 provides an account of the ways in which clauses
combine with each other. When, as often happens, phenomena from different levels of the
language converge and interact, then a good deal of cross-referencing will be found. Despite
the fact that there is no separate chapter devoted to the study of Karo discourse by itself,
information about the discourse significance of particular constructions is provided together
with the description of the relevant forms.
With the exception of Chapter 2, each of the language examples presented is accompanied
by an interlinear gloss, plus a rendering into idiomatic English. Although an attempt is made
to keep them as uniform as possible, the interlinear glosses sometimes vary to suit the
demands of the discussion. In most instances they provide a morpheme-by-morpheme
account, but where larger constituents need to be identified, this is indicated using the
appropriate symbols and parentheses. Apart from the special orthographic conventions
adopted here to distinguish the different phonological values represented by the grapheme 'e'
(see §2.6.2), the format of the Karo language examples reflects the orthographic practices
employed by native speakers. Thus morpheme breaks within the word are not indicated in
the vernacular examples, but are marked by the use of a full stop in the interlinear gloss. The
full stop also serves to join together a number of words which collectively refer to a single
fonn in the vernacular, where Karo-English morpheme correspondences are not readily
expressible, for example, perlahangna 'the.not.being.the.case.of. In vernacular examples
the hyphen serves to indicate reduplicated forms (see §3.9); in those cases where such forms
have a single meaning, no corresponding morpheme break. is indicated in the interlinear
gloss.","[17, 18]"

In that way the field was sown.
Each of the clauses in examples (6. 1 ) , (6.2) and (6.3a) contains a verb relating two
nominal participants, identifiable in semantic terms as ACTOR and UNDERGOER. These
terms are used here as defined by Foley and Van Valin ( 1984:29):
Provisionally we may characterise the actor as the argument of a predicate which
perfonns, effects, instigates or controls the situation denoted by the predicate,
and the undergoer as the argument which expresses the participant which does
not perform, initiate or control any situation but rather is affected by it in some
way.
Actor and undergoer are generalised semantic relations, or macroroles, which admit the
possibility for further specification of say, the actor as agent, experiencer, instrument, or1851 86
source, and so on.37 However, such expansion of case-roles is not especially relevant to
Karo grammatical organisation.
It can be seen from examples (6. 1 ) and (6.2) that in each pair of clauses, the semantic
relations hold constant; that is, propositional meaning is unchanged. In the (a) clauses, the
actor is the first-mentioned participant. It occupies the subject position, and its role as actor is
marked by the inflectional prefix NL on the verb stem (§3.4. 1 . 1 ). This correspondence of
actor with subject fits with the conunonly accepted definition of an ACTIVE clause. By
contrast, in the (b) clauses, it is the undergoer which occupies subject position, with the verb
prefix i- marking this undergoer-as-subject role, and the actor being relegated to post-verbal
position. In example (6.3b) there is no actor present in the clause at all. In so far as it serves
to undo the choice of actor for subject and replace it with undergoer instead, plus in some
cases delete all reference to an actor, this (b)-type configuration clearly corresponds to the
PASSIVE.38
The above data provide merely an introductory glimpse of the transitive system in Karo,
which as will emerge below, exhibits a number of interesting complexities and apparent
anomalies, some of which may raise the question of whether 'active' and 'passive' are truly
applicable to the phenomena encountered in Karo transitive clauses. The position taken here
is that for the purpose of describing transitivity in Karo, it is not inappropriate to employ the
terms ' active.' and 'passive' as labels for construction types of the kind exemplified above. It
is emphasised, however, that the use of such familiar terms as labels for constructions of a
particular morphosyntactic type, should not be confused with the meanings or functions
associated with those constructions.39 As will emerge from the following account, the
function of the Karo passive is not entirely congruent with that of other languages, even
those which are closely related, such as Indonesian. Nevertheless, as long as this limitation
is borne in mind, the use of this conservative terminology is felt to be more a convenience
than a hindrance in embarking upon a discussion of the Karo transitive system.
A detailed description of the formal aspects of active and passive clauses is now provided,
followed by an account of their relative frequencies of occurrence, their relationship to each
other, and their functions.","[195, 196]"

"7.7 LEFr AND RIGHT-DISLOCAnONS
-7.7. 1 LEFr-DISLOCATION
This is a construction whereby an NP occurs preceding a clause, from which it is marked
off by a separate intonation peak and a potential pause (indicated orthographically by a
comma). This NP is linked to the clause by means of an anaphoric pronoun, which can bear
any of the following grammatical roles: subject (examples (7.447), (7.448)), agent «7.449),(7 .450)), object « 7.45 1 ), (7.452)), possessor « 7.453), (7.454)), or complement of a
prepositional phrase «7.455), (7.456)). Of these, possessor is the most common. (For the
sake of clarity, the pronoun referring to the initial NP is underlined.)(7.447)Aku, lawes aku.

"60Ellipsis does not cover cases of systematic omission of elements such as the second person addressee in
imperatives (§7.2. 1 ), or the absence of agents in passive clauses where the identity of the actor isunknown or irrelevant (§6.3 . 1 .3). There are several other cases of omission of elements, however, where
it is debatable as to whether ellipsis is involved'or not:
(i) the omission of the locative preposition i 'in, at, on' in speech (a feature especially of the lowlandswestern dialect) and the preposition man 'to, for' in Dative-2 PPs (§4.2.4.2). For example:(I)(2)Kempungkusi. .gelah ula

My oldest grandchild is attending school [in] Medan.
.banta kejadin silamehuli.come to.us event
REL not good
... so that something bad does not happen to us.
(ii) the omission of a Dative-2 PP in the presence of a verb expressing transfer, or in the case of pseudo­
reflexive clauses (§6.4.3). For example:(3)Adi ka/imbubu,arussibert5ken manuk(man bana).if

As for the kalimbubu, we must present a chicken (to them).
(iii) the omission of conjunctions expressing time, condition, reason and antithesis when two clauses are
linked paratactically (§8.5).
In each of the above cases, the frequency of omission of the elements is such as to make their absence
virtually systemic, yet their reinstatement to the clauses is universally recognised by native speakers as
effecting grammatical completeness.",[297]
"8 .3 . 1 ROLE RESTRICTIONS AFFECTING THE SHARED NP
As stated above, the clauses thus combined in series are linked by a common nominal
element which is usually the subject of both. As the above examples show, the semantic role
of this shared subject may be actor (example (8.200» , undergoer (example (8.209» , or
simultaneously both (example (8.206».
One other possibility exists for the shared constituent: it may be a possessive NP whose
head is expounded by a noun referring to some inalienable body part or action possessed or
performed by an animate entity which is both the referent of the Possessive slot of the NP
and the putative subject of the second clause. Such cases occur only in accordance with the
second ordering possibility described above (i.e. between the two clauses).

"1.2 LINGUISTIC AFFILIATIONS AND RELATED SPEECH VARIETIES
Following Voorhoeve (1955:9), the Batak languages may be divided into two mutually
unintelligible groups: the Northern, which comprises Karo, Pakpak and Alas, and the
Southern, which includes Toba, Angkola and Mandailing. Voorhoeve places the
geographically intermediate Simalungun as linguistically midway, though in a more recent
study, Adelaar (1981) concludes that Simalungun is more closely related to the Southern
group.
It remains an open question as to how many of these different Batak tongues ought to be
regarded as distinct languages, as opposed to dialects of the one language. Against the north­
south grouping adopted above is the reality that a line of mutual intelligibility may be traced
between adjacent languages in the chain from north to south. Yet the fact that each of the
groups recognises and asserts its identity on the basis of clan names and social organisation
suggests that sociocultural factors play a role equally as important as linguistic ones in
determining where dialects end and new languages begin. In many ways the issue of the
Batak linguistic divisions seems to parallel the case of the Scandinavian dialect continuum.",[13]
"PASS.crawl weAfter we got a bit closer, we crawled along on our hands and knees (towards
the tree).
These clauses are structurally identical to the passive reflexives described in §6.3.2. 1 , in that
they contain a (more or less obligatory) prepositional phrase in place of the usual nominal
undergoer. In so far as the verbs in these clauses are typically locative (either implicitly so, or
explicitly marked with the locative suffix-i-see §3.5. 1), or in the case of thecommunication verbs, typically associated with phrases designating the substance of the
communication or thought, then the referential content of the accompanying prepositional
phrases is - from a semantic perspective - consistently compatible with a verb-undergoer
relationship. As was the case with the passive reflexives, this 'undergoer-like' material is
encoded not as a fully-fledged, syntactically central constituent (i.e. subject) but as a
grammatically oblique or peripheral element instead. Why this should be so, when the
language demonstrably possesses the means to elevate such (semantic) undergoers to ahigher syntactic status, is not entirely clear. Part of the reason may be that their identity isoften too vague or 'unfocusable' to be relegated to the status of a true undergoer. Consider
for instance the nebulous and imprecise identity of the location referred to in clauses such as
the following:(6.83)si nguda-nguda ku kawes kemuhen.",[209]

"8.2.9 NOUNS WHICH TAKE COMPLEMENTS
As described above, the majority of cases of complementation involve a complement
clause bearing some relation to a particular adjectival or verbal predicator. It is also possible
for complement clauses to occur with certain nouns, which may be roots themselves, or
derived from adjectives and verbs (principally from the sets described in §8.2.2 and §8.2.3).
Structurally, a complement clause associated with a particular noun is usually encoded as an
exponent of the Descriptive slot in the NP (§4. l .S.5):Bagendam carn majekken rumah adat.",[331]

functors, it has a very high potential for occurrence in words which bear phrase
stress. For example:

"CHAPTER 4PHRASE STRUCTUREThis chapter describes two major phrase types in Karo: noun phrases (§4. 1 ) and
prepositional phrases (§4.2). Other phrasal constructions are also found in the language, but
for reasons of descriptive cohesion are dealt with in other chapters. They include:
- incorporated nominals (§3.6.8, §5.5.2);
- passive predicate phrases (§6.3 . 1 . 1 - §6.3.1 .3);
- constituents modified by operators, such as negatives, adjective modifiers, aspect
markers, quantifying markers and various particles (§7.4. 1 - §7.4.5).","[115, 116]"
"These facts militate against Adelaar's (1981:2) conclusion that Karo possesses a set of long
vowel phonemes. The argument that vowel length is distinctive on the basis of examples
such as man 'for' versus ma:n 'eat' is only valid as long as the latter receives phrase stress,78This is also the case for certain other forms, such as Indaharl [ndahaf] 'near', which has a regular variant
Indih;;)rl [ndlha f], although the stress placement on this word can be accounted for by the statement in
§2.1 . 1 .1 (i).
Neumann's dictionary lists this as a probable corruption of Inandekul 'my mother'. in which case it is
clearly vocative in origin.",[23]
"Following any class of predicator except phasal verbs (set IV above), the complement
clause may be introduced by the conjunctions maka(nay 'that' , geJah 'so that' (in the case of
verbs of request or recommendation), or entah ' if, whether' (in the case of higher clause
constructions expressing ignorance). For example:(8. 1 23)La pediatna

The participant fronted in these cases is usually 'old' (previously mentioned) information

always post-modified by pe (§7.4.5.2. 10). NPs fronted in this way usually have a low
discourse salience; that is, they are merely incidental or peripheral to the story-line or
situation being described. Thus the reason for fronting appears not to be associated with
topicality, either new, sustained or resumed. Furthermore, investigation with informants
reveals that in the above examples, the S-P clauses concerned could be just as easily and
acceptably rendered as P-S, in which event the marking with pe would be dropped. These
facts suggest that the fronting of subject NPs in the above circumstances is optional and non­
thematic, and that the obligatory marking with pe indicates that the fronted NP is 'out of
position' . As much as anything else, the function of fronting in these cases may simply be to
provide variation for its own sake, from the usual predicate-first ordering.",[292]
