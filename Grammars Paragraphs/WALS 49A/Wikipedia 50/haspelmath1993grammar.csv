Verbal valence15.1. Verbal valence patterns: introduction
Verbal valence patterns are represented here in the following format:
V (ACASEI/ BCASE2/···)where V stands for the verb, and A and Β stand for arguments in the case
indicated by the subscript (the order of the arguments is arbitrary). The letters used as variables for arguments are arbitrary and serve only to distinguish different arguments. However, I will often use letters that can be
thought of as mnemonic for particular semantic roles (A: ""agent"", T:
""theme"", L: ""location"", E: ""experiencer"", R: ""recipient""). Otherwise no attempt is made to systematically describe the semantic roles expressed by the
arguments; this information is left implicit in the translations of the individual verbs.
Let us take a concrete example: The verb ilisun has the valence pattern:
V (AERG/ TABS/ LSRESS)and means Ά presses L by putting Τ in contact with L (= A presses L with
T)'. This means that it has an (""agent"") argument in the Ergative case which
corresponds to the subject of 'press' in the translation, a (""theme"") argument
in the Absolutive case which corresponds to the object of 'put in contact
with', and a (""location"") argument in the Superessive case corresponding to
the object of 'press'. This is all the information contained in a valence
frame, and it is sufficient, for example, to obtain the correct translation of
the following sentence:
(717) Adahe(ERG)knopka.da-lbutton-SRESSt'ubilis-na. (R66:9)finger press-AOR'He pressed the button by putting his finger in contact with it.'
(= 'He pressed the button with his finger.'
Lit. 'He pressed his finger on the button.')15.2. General characteristics of verbal valence patterns
There are very tight restrictions on possible verbal valence patterns, especially the following:
(i) There are no verbs that take fewer than one argument. Weather situations (rain, snow, etc.), which are expressed by zero-argument verbs in many

etc. (However,
predicative adjectives may be subjectless, cf. 17.3.)
(ii) There are no verbs that take more than three arguments.
(iii) Most of the valence patterns contain an Absolutive argument. There
are a few exceptions which belong to the ""non-standard valence patterns""
and are discussed in 15.4. below.
(iv) For each intransitive valence pattern with an Absolutive argument
there is a corresponding transitive valence pattern which contains the same
arguments plus an Ergative argument.
(v) Except for the purely adnominal Genitive case and the rare Directive
cases, all cases occur in at least one valence pattern together with an
Absolutive argument (but see 15.3.15. for ""Genitive arguments"").
Thus, the valence patterns in (718) are the most typical, and they are
therefore called ""standard valence patterns"" here. Each of them is exemplified in one subsection of 15.3.

restrictions on the form that the adverbial will take).
V (TABS, L A D V)V (A E R G , TABS, L a d v )(15.3.14.)In addition, there are two groups of ""non-standard valence patterns"". In
the first group, there is a Dative argument with subject properties (15.4.1.),
and in the second group, the Absolutive argument has been incorporated
into the verb so that there is no Absolutive argument in the valence pattern
(""Absolutive absorption"", 15.4.2.1.).
The valence patterns of verbs that take clausal arguments (=complement
clauses) have not been taken into account here. For such complement-taking verbs, see Ch. 20.
The general principles to which Lezgian valence patterns conform
(especially (i)-(v) above) are not particularly exotic or exceptional. Aside
from Ergativity, there are only two features that set Lezgian off from the familiar European languages: Dative experiencers and consistent Absolutive

expressions (cf. 15.4.1.), the experiencer is expressed in the Dative case:
(719) Zamira.di-zDianaZamita-DATDianaaku-na.
see-AOR'Zamira saw Diana, (lit. Diana was visible to Zamira.)'
And themes are consistently in the Absolutive case, even where a patient
argument is also present and would be the direct object in the familiar
European languages. In Lezgian, this patient is expressed in one of the local
cases. For example, the patient arguments of the verbs 'stroke' and 'sweep'
appear in the Adelative and Superelative cases, respectively, in the following examples (an analogous example is (717) above).
(720) Emirmet.a
Emirmet(ERG)qhilqw.e-wajgilgiic'-na. (Q81:113)cheek-ADELhandstroke-AOR'Emirmet stroked her cheek with his hand.' (Lit. 'Emirmet stroked his
hand along her cheek.')
(721) Aminat.a
Aminat(ERG)k'wal.e-lajkkulelä-na. (Talibov 1958:241)room-SRELbroomsweep-AOR'Aminat swept the room with a broom.' (Lit. 'Aminat swept the
broom through the room.')
In the familiar European languages, the Lezgian local patients have to be
rendered as direct objects, and the Lezgian Absolutive themes correspond to
instrumental phrases. These instrumental phrases sound somewhat redundant in the translations of (720M721) because the verbal actions ('stroke',
'sweep') are such that they are exclusively or typically carried out with these
instruments. But this is not the case in Lezgian because quite generally verb
meaning is more general than in the familiar European languages. For example, gilc'un not only means 'stroke', but also 'wipe' (stoldiwaj pek giic'un
'wipe a table with a cloth') or 'rub', and elägun not only means 'sweep', but
also 'wave (with a cap)' and 'nod (one's head)'.
These characteristics of Lezgian valence patterns can be generalized and
we can say that Lezgian shows a tendency toward a closer correspondence
between semantic roles and case-marking: Agents are always in the Ergative
case, themes are always in the Absolutive, recipients and experiencers are
always in the Dative, patients are always in one of the local cases. This is in
marked contrast to the familiar European languages, where nominative
subjects can be agents, themes, experiencers, and sometimes even patients,
accusative direct objects can be themes, patients, or experiencers, etc. It is
true that there are exceptions in Lezgian as well; for instance, the Absolutive
argument of kiligun (CABS/ DDAT) ' C looks at D' would appear to be an agent
rather than a theme, and Lezgian also has metaphorical expressions like i
banka.di pud litr q'ada (Talibov & Gad2iev 1966:207) 'this can holds three
liters'. But it cannot be denied that there is a tendency toward a closer link
between semantic roles and case-marking, so that we can call Lezgian a
""role-dominated language"" (cf. Foley & Van Valin 1984, A. E. Kibrik 1980b).","[287, 288, 289, 290]"
"16.1. Grammatical relations: the notion of subject
16.1.1. Subject properties
Notions such as subject, direct object, indirect object, etc. (i.e. grammatical
relations, or syntactic functions) are generally used sparingly in this book.
The reason is that their use is not as straightforward in role-dominated languages like Lezgian as it is in reference-dominated languages like English.
There are very few generalizations that need to be stated over grammatical
relations.
The subject is the most important grammatical relation, and I will mostly
be concerned with this notion in this section. There is some evidence, albeit
rather slight, that a notion of subject is needed in Lezgian grammar. The arguments that have subject status are the Absolutive argument of intransitive verbs, the Ergative argument of transitive verbs, and the Dative argument in the Affective Construction.
However, most of the properties that often serve to identify subjects in
other languages do not uniquely identify subjects in Lezgian. Following
Keenan (1976), we can divide subject properties into coding properties and
behavioral properties. Coding properties are case marking, subject-verb
agreement, word order and the like. Case marking would of course identify
the Absolutive argument both of intransitive and of transitive sentences as
the subject. However, case marking is not normally considered sufficient
evidence for grammatical relations in languages with ergative case marking.
Subject-verb agreement is lacking in Lezgian. There is some weak evidence
from word order that Ergative agents and Dative experiencers are both subjects, because both precede the Absolutive argument in the unmarked order:

and Maxaikala who spent many hours with me, patiently answering questions whose points were mostly obscure to them: Muminat M. Gusejnova,
Maisa Xalimbekova, Muradxan Axmedov, Fizuli and Salbuzdag Kurbanov,
Nizam Zagirov, Etibar Bagirov, Farid I. Gusejnov.
I am very grateful to Professor Axmedula G. Gjul'magomedov for his
hospitality in Maxaikala, to Muminat and Ibrahim Gusejnov for making
me feel at home in their house, and to Farid Gusejnov for his friendship.
I also profited from discussions with Bukar B. Talibov, Enver M. Sejxov
and RadZidin I. Gajdarov in Maxaikala, and with Sandro V. Kodzasov,
Mixail E. Alekseev, Vjaieslav A. Cirikba, and Aleksandr E. Kibrik in
Moscow.
Georg Bossong read the whole manuscript and suggested various improvements. Sandro Kodzasov, Matthias Butt, and Michael Job read earlier
versions of the phonological chapters and provided numerous valuable
suggestions. And special thanks are due to Matthias Butt for solving all my
computational problems.
This work would not have been possible without the generous financial
and organizational support of the German Academic Exchange Service
(DAAD). I thank Moscow State University and especially the Linguistics
Department for their hospitality (Irina Μ. Kobozeva, Aleksandr E. Kibrik).
And I would also like to mention some of my Moscow friends and colleagues who made my stay there such a unique experience: Sergej A.
Krylov, Mira Β. Bergel'son, Andrej A. Kibrik, Vladimir A. Plungian, Ol'ga
Ju. Boguslavskaja, Igor' M. Boguslavskij, Yakov G. Testelec, Leonid I.
Kulikov, Vera I. Podlesskaya and (from Leningrad/St.Petersburg) Vladimir
P. Nedjalkov.
Most of the actual writing of this grammar was done while I had the privilege to work in the ideal environment of the European Science Foundation
Programme in Language Typology (EUROTYP), together with its Programme Director Ekkehard König and dozens of linguists from all over
Europe, whose interest in Lezgian has always kept me motivated.
Finally, I have to thank Hans-Jürgen Sasse, George Smith, Stefanie
Eschenlohr, and Albrecht Hofheinz for help of various kinds.

Introduction1.1. The Lezgian language and its genetic affiliation
Lezgian is spoken by about 400,000 people in southern Daghestan and
northern Azerbaijan in the eastern Caucasus. (See 2.1. for details on Lezgian
speakers.) Lezgian has been written since 1928, first in the Latin alphabet,
from 1938 onward in the Cyrillic alphabet. This grammar describes the standard language, which is based on the lowland Güne dialect. (See 2.2. for
more on Lezgian dialects, and 2.3. for more information on the status of
Lezgian and the standard language.)
Lezgian is a member of the Lezgic branch of the Nakho-Daghestanian
family of languages. The family tree of Nakho-Daghestanian is shown in (1)
(following Hewitt 1981a:197).

(1961), GiginejSvili (1977), Kibrik & Kodzasov (1988), (1990). Comparative
studies of the Lezgic languages include Alekseev (1980) and Schulze (1983).
The Nakho-Daghestanian family is also sometimes called ""North-East
Caucasian"" or ""East Caucasian"". Such terms are avoided here because they
could strengthen the still widespread misconception (see, e.g., Voegelin &
Voegelin 1966, Ruhlen 1987) that the Nakho-Daghestanian family is part of
a larger ""Caucasian"" family, comprising also the Kartvelian (""South
Caucasian"") family and the Abkhazo-Adyghean (""North-West Caucasian"")
family. However, the main feature that these families have in common, besides being spoken in the Caucasus region, is that they are not related to any

although they also share a few typological features (ergativity, ejective consonants). Of course, it cannot be excluded that the Nakho-Daghestanian,
Kartvelian, and Abkhazo-Adyghean languages will some day turn out to be
related after all, but so far a genetic relationship has not been proved.","[4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22]"

However, this construction is never used in the modern language, where
the instrumental function is expressed by the Superelative or Superessive
cases (cf. 7.2.2.14., 7.2.2.16.).
7.2.2.3. The Genitive case. The Genitive has an array of functions that is typical for many languages. It expresses alienable and inalienable possession,

However, the Genitive cannot be used in constructions like 'the city of
Bombay', which are expressed by an appositional constructions (14.3.).
A non-referential Genitive noun often corresponds to a Russian or
English relational adjective, as in (154). Since Lezgian lacks special relational
adjectives, this is the only way to express such notions.

to an English first compound member.

The Genitive has one non-adnominal use. The Genitive is used to express a distance with spatial expressions (cf. 156) or a time interval with
temporal expressions (cf. 157).

Genitive NPs resemble adjectives in that they can be substantivized by
means of the substantivizer -dil-bur (cf. 8.1.1.). This substantivization is
obligatory when the Genitive NP is used predicatively, e.g.
(159) a. Balk'an
horsewi-dituS,imyou:GEN-SBST.SGCOP:NEGthis:ABS we:GENpaöah.di-n-dija. (X89:115)king-GEN-SBST.SGCOPöiT h e horse is not yours, it's our king's.'
b. Axpamajdana f t e r w a r d placeöi-dija. (M83:31)we:GEN-SBST.SGCOP'After that the place is ours.'
For a special use of the substantivized form of the reduced Genitive, cf.
7.1.2.5. (the ""paucal plural"").
Finally, the Genitive is governed by many postpositions, cf. 12.2.
7.2.2.4. The Dative case. This case expresses recipient, experiencer, direction,
time, and the like. In its local directional meaning it replaces the missing
""Indirective"" case. Examples (160) and (161) show the recipient function
with verbs of transfer of things (160) and information (161).

of clauses (cf. the examples in (658)). They are therefore not discussed in this
chapter; see 19.1.2. for substantivized relative clauses, 20.3. for Masdar noun
clauses, and 20.4. for participial noun clauses).
Pronouns in the strict sense are first and second person pronouns (zun,
wun, Hun, kiin), reflexive pronouns (zuw, wiö, öeb), and interrogative pronouns ( w u i w u i ) . The other ""pronouns"" are all substantivized NP modifiers, e.g. im 'this one', am 'that one, he/she/it' (substantivized forms of i
'this', a 'that'), sadni 'nobody' (substantivized form of sa-...-ni 'no', lit.
'even one'). See Ch. 11 for details on pronouns.
Non-pronominal NPs generally have nouns as their head, but the head
may also be a substantivized NP modifier: a substantivized adjective, a substantivized quantifier or demonstrative, or a substantivized Genitive NP (cf.
8.1.1.).
For apposition, see 14.3.
Note that the above list of possible nominal modifiers does not include
postpositional phrases, NPs in oblique cases, or adverbs. Thus, a noun
phrase like 'stories about farm life' needs an additional verb ('written') to
make a relative clause:
(659) Kolxoz.di-n[kolkhoz-CENja£aji£.di-kaj
life-SBELk&e-nwa-jwrite-PRF-PTP]rasskaz-ar
story-PL(E56:3)'stories about collective farm life'
Or an adjective based on a postposition may be used, e.g. wilikan
for wilik 'before'.
(660) revoljucija.di-laj
revolution-SRELwilikanprevious'previous'ilmilrlife'life before the revolution'
Not infrequently the participial form of the copula tir is used to create a possible nominal modifier.
(661) a. hajwan-r.i-kaj tir
[animal-PL-SBELCOP:PTP]max-ar (Du85,3:114)
story-PL'fairy tales about animals (lit. fairy tales which are about animals)'
b. Cexoslovakija.d-aj tir
[Czechoslovakia-INELCOP:PTP]ajal-ar (K85,7:l)
child-PL'children from Czechoslovakia'
However, the rule that postpositional phrases, oblique-case NPs, and adverbs may not be nominal modifiers is now sometimes violated under the
influence of Russian.","[271, 272]"

There are four main types (or series) of indefinite pronouns: ordinary, freechoice, specific, and negative indefinites. Some of the indefinite pro-forms
from this series are illustrated in (453).
(453) ordinary
sa wui jat'anifree-choice
wui &ajit'anispecific
kasnegative
sa kas-nisa wuö jat'aniwuöStajit'anisa zat'sa zat'nisa musjat'animusitajit'anisadrasadranisa hinajat'anihinaAajit'anisanasananietc.etc.sa'a person''anyone''someone''something'
'sometime''somewhere''anything'
'anytime''anywhere'etc.'a thing''nothing'
'never''once'
'at a place'etc.'nobod/'nowhere'The formation of ordinary and free-choice indefinites is quite straightforward: The indefiniteness-marking particle jat'ani /Aajit'ani follows the
corresponding interrogative pro-form, and in the case of the ordinary indefinite, the numeral sa 'one' in addition precedes the interrogative. The formation of specific and negative indefinites is somewhat more complicated,
cf. 11.6.3.-4.
When indefinites function as nominal modifiers, the particle iajit'ani
follows the whole noun phrase, while the particle jat'ani tends to follow
the interrogative immediately:
(454) a. hiwhichwaxt.und-a
time-lNESSAajit'aniINDEF'at any time'
b. sahi&tin jat'anione whichINDEFqalabuluxconfusion'some sort of confusion'
The formal makeup of the two indefiniteness-markers jat'ani
and
itajit'ani is quite transparent: They are concessive conditional verb forms of
the standard copula ja and the verb £un 'be', respectively. Thus, the meaning of wui itajit'ani is literally 'whoever it may be' (cf. 21.8.4., and the quite
analogous French form qui que ce soit).
11.6.1. Ordinary indefinite pronouns
This series of indefinites generally corresponds to the English so/ne-series.
(Note that the sa is occasionally omitted, as in (455f).)
(455) a. Cilkwer.asa wuö jat'aniCükwer(ERG) one what INDEFcwa-zwa-j.sew-IMPF-PST(S88:10)'Cükwer was sewing something.'

"1.2. An overview of Lezgian grammar
This section is an introduction to the typologically most striking features of
Lezgian. Detailed information on each topic can be found in later chapters.
1.2.1. Phonology and morphophonemics
Lezgian has six phonemic vowels which form an asymmetric system which
is typologically rather unusual. Distinctive length of /a/ and /as/ is marginal.
iey
aeu
aWith its 54 members, the Lezgian consonant inventory is quite rich.
There are 34 occlusives, in six places of articulation (labial, dental, dental sibilant, postalveolar sibilant, velar, uvular) and four series (voiced, voiceless
unaspirated, voiceless aspirated, voiceless ejective). Dental, velar, and uvular obstruents have a labialized and a non-labialized variant.

Until recently, Lezgian had only syllables of the structure CV, CVC, and
CVCC. The last type occurs only at the end of a morpheme (e.g. /wertfh/ 'hen',
/halth-zawa/ 'meets'), and morpheme-internal consonant clusters (CVC-CV...)
are restricted to a few types in native words.
Quite recently Lezgian has undergone a sound change of vowel syncope
that eliminated high vowels in pretonic position between voiceless obstruents, e.g.
/tfhu'xun/
/sv'pekh/
/kn'tf'e/
/sith'%a/>

progress, a large number of new morpheme-initial consonant clusters has
arisen. In addition, the syncopated vowels often leave the preceding consonant labialized (in the case of syncopated Inf) or palatalized (in the case of /i/)
or both (in the case of /y/), so that a whole new class of palatalized and labialized-palatalized voiceless obstruents has come into being. This change complicates the description of Lezgian phonology considerably.
Another prominent feature of Lezgian is the occurrence of various consonant alternations in nouns. The Absolutive Singular form, which ends in
zero, often differs from the other forms, e.g.
Word-final Ejective Aspiration
/ne't'er/'lice'/net*1/'louse'/t'ab/'block (Abs.)'Word-final Ejective Voicing
/t'a'p'uni/'block (Erg.)'Word-final Unaspirated Voicing
/tse'kwer/'ants'/tsegw/'ant'Pre-obstruent Unaspirated Aspiration
/tsykh/'flower'/tshlflcwer/'flowers'Lezgian also shows palatal (/e, i, y/ vs. /a, u[) and labial (/u, y/ vs. Of) v o w e l
harmony, but only in the first two syllables of a word. For instance, the
oblique stem suffix -Uni has the alternants /-ini/, /-uni/, /-yni/:

Lezgian morphology is overwhelmingly suffixing and agglutinating.
Nouns, adjectives, and verbs can be easily distinguished by morphological
criteria.
Nouns are inflected for number (Singular, Plural), case (Absolutive,
Ergative, Genitive, Dative, Essive, Elative, Directive), and localization (Ad,
Sub, Post, Super, In). The locative cases Essive, Elative, and Directive occur
in combination with the localizations (Ad-essive, Sub-elative, Super-directive, etc.). All cases other than the Absolutive are based on a special oblique
stem whose suffix is idiosyncratic for many nouns. An example (hül 'sea'):

postpositions, and noun inflections tend to express more abstract relations.
The only inflections of adjectives are the substantivizing suffix -di (e.g.
c'iji 'new', c'iji-di 'new one') the adverbial suffixes -(di)z / -dakaz
(e.g.jawaS
'slow', jawa$-diz 'slowly').
Verbs are inflected for tense-aspect, negation, several mood forms and
various non-finite forms. There are no person-number agreement forms.
The most important inflected verb forms are (from gun 'give'):

ta-ga-j-laThere is little derivational morphology in Lezgian. The most important
nominal derivational suffix is the abstract suffix -wal (c'iji-wal 'new-ness').
Verbs can be derived from verbs by means of the causative suffix -(a)r
0aqwaz-un 'stop (intr.)', aqwaz-ar-un 'stop (tr.)'). Some derivational affixes
have been borrowed along with loanwords and are so common that they
must be considered Lezgian affixes, e.g. nominal -6i (e.g. lawga-ü
'proud
person'), adjectival -lu, -suz (e.g. meSreblu
'pleasant', me Srebsuz
'unpleasant'), verbal -lamiSun (e.g. leke-lami§un 'stain, soil').
1.2.3. Syntax
Word order patterns in Lezgian are overwhelmingly head-final. This order
is obligatory in noun phrases (Genitive-noun, adjective-noun, numeralnoun, demonstrative-noun, etc.), adjective phrases, and postpositional
phrases, and it is preferred for clauses. However, alongside SOV order other
orders are also possible, especially in the spoken language.
The case-marking patterns in clauses is uniformly ergative, as shown in
(2) (for notational conventions used in example sentences, see 1.3.4.-5.).

Dative subjects occur with some experiential verbs, e.g.
(3) Wax.a-zstxaaku-na.sister-DAT brother(ABS) see-AORT h e sister saw the brother.'
There is no agreement in Lezgian, neither in noun phrases nor on finite
verbs. Personal pronouns are normally used if there are no full noun
phrase arguments. (However, these may be omitted if they can be recovered
from the context.)
(4) Adaaburk'wal.i-zshe(ERG) they(ABS)raqur-na.house-DATsend-AOR'She sent them home.'
Lezgian has practically no rules that change grammatical relations. There
is only a derivational suffix -(a)r (causative) which turns intransitive verbs
into transitive verbs.
Subordinate clauses are normally non-finite, i.e. marked by special subordinating verb forms, and they generally precede the superordinate clause.
Relative clauses make use of the participles, which have no inherent orientation and can therefore be used to relativize almost any constituent.

Complement clauses are of three major types: Masdar (verbal noun)
complements (6), Infinitival complements (7), and participial complements
(8).","[22, 23, 24, 25, 26]"
"10.2. The anticausative
A considerable number of transitive weak verbs allow the derivation of a
corresponding anticausative. This is formed from the stem of the base verb
and the verb xun 'become, be'. (Alternatively, one could say that the anticausative is derived from the Periphrasis form of the base verb. Since antiBrought to you by | Max-Planck-Gesellschaft - WIB6417

identical to their stem, it is impossible to decide whether the anticausative is
derived from the stem or from the Periphrasis form.)

as occurring without an external agent (i.e. the agent is not just backgrounded, as it is in passive constructions in other languages, but completely eliminated from the conceptual structure). This semantic property
accounts for the restricted nature of the anticausative derivation: many
transitive events simply cannot be conceptualized as occurring without an
external agent. For instance, horn geqigun 'compare', there is no *geqig £un
'undergo comparison' because comparisons are not conceived of as occurring without an agent who does the comparing.
In some cases the process denoted by the anticausative is not inactive —
in such cases an English translation by means of a reflexive verb is sometimes appropriate.

'arrive at a conviction'When a transitive verb is derived from a noun or adjective by means of
awun (cf. 10.6.) or -ar- (cf. 10.6.3.), a corresponding intransitive verb also
often exists. The relationship between these two verbs then looks very similar to the relationship between transitives and anticausatives as in (375).
However, in the following pairs (377-378) the intransitive members are not
derived from their transitive counterparts, but both are derived from the
same third word. The examples in (375-376) are crucially different in that the
transitive member of the pair is a primary verb (at least synchronically).

Preverbs are verbal prefixes with an original locative meaning, quite similar
to Indo-European preverbs as in trans-fer, con-fer, de-fer, etc. In contrast to
all the other derivational categories described here, preverbs are no longer
productive in Lezgian (they are still quite regular and productive in the
closely related Tabasaran).
About 18 preverbs can be identified, and two dozen verb roots occur with
identifiable preverbs. Six roots occur with more than ten different preverbs,
but quite a few are not combined with more than a handful.
In most cases, the meaning of the preverb is no longer clearly discernible,
and it may be that the majority of preverb verbs listed below are no longer
analyzed by native speakers, so that the analysis is only diachronically valid.
Nevertheless, in some cases the meaning of the preverb and its contribution
to the derived verb's meaning are quite clear, e.g.
(379) preverb Aq- 'out'
aq-atun
'fall out'
eq-eö'un
'go out'
aq-udun
'take ouf
eq-isun
'stick out'

al-udun
'take off'
al-azun
'tear off'
al-atun
'fall off
al-at'un
'cut off'
The preverbs not only modify the meaning of the root of a verb, they also
co-determine the valence pattern of the verb (cf. 10.3.2.). These valence patterns are usually preserved even where the meaning is totally idiomatic.
10.3.1. The forms of the preverbsThere are three or four preverbs consisting of just one consonant.

a single consonant. The quality of the vowel (a or e) is determined by vowel
harmony (see 4.4.).

front vowel: il-igun (~ el-igun) 'beat', il-it'un 'tie around', ig-isun 'approach'
(cf. 3.2.2.2.).
There are four or five preverbs of the form CAC-, and three preverbs of
the form ACAC-. Since all the consonants that occur in these biconsonantal
preverbs also occur in the monoconsonantal preverbs, one can think of
these preverbs as compound preverbs, consisting of a combination of
monoconsonantal preverbs (cf. Talibov 1958). Also, verbs with the biconsonantal preverbs are often semantically quite similar to verbs with the corresponding monoconsonantal preverbs.

(385) xk-xk-eö'un (< xik-)xk-atun (< xuk-)Some of the consonants that show up in preverbs, namely k, ui, q, and I,
are identical to the consonants that signal the localizations in the nominal
declension (cf. 7.1.2.1.). That this is not an accident is shown in the next section.
10.3.2. The syntax of verbs with preverbs
It should have become apparent from the above examples (and it becomes
even clearer in in the complete list of preverbs below in 10.3.3.) that the
meaning of the preverb is not transparent synchronically in the majority of
cases. But the preverbs have one effect that turns out to be more durable:
Their influence on the verbs' valence patterns.
Several preverbs are associated with particular localizations. A verb with
a preverb generally governs a local case of the localization with which its

is transitive, the Ergative case). For instance, the preverb Al- is associated
with the Super localization, and a verb with the preverb Al- will generally
have an argument in the Superessive or Superelative case in its valence
pattern. Thus:

This situation strongly reminds one of preverbs in Indo-European languages, as in the Latin and German examples in (388)-(389).

(389) German
Als
sie
whensheausfromder Kutsche
thecoachaus-stieg,...out-stepped'When she got off the coach...'
In these examples, one locative expression ( a d and aus, respectively) is
used twice in two different syntactic positions: As a preverb and as an adposition. Similarly, the original meaning of a sentence like (386) must have
been 'Ali put-on his shoes on his feet'. On the analogy of the well-documented situation in Indo-European we may confidently speculate that the
consonants k, w, q, and I are the remnants of earlier locative adverbs that
have become grammaticized in two positions: as localization suffixes on
nouns, and as locative preverbs on verbs.
The following list shows which preverbs are associated with which localizations:

In addition to the association of preverbs with localizations, there is also
an association with postpositions and adverbs based on nouns in these localizations, e.g. the postposition k'anik 'under' (Subessive of k'an 'bottom')
is associated with the preverbs Ak-, kw-, xk-, e.g.

"22.1. Pronominal anaphora and pronoun dropping
The substantivized demonstrative am (11.4.) 'that one' serves as a personal
pronoun corresponding to 'he/she/it'. Since Lezgian verbs do not show
agreement with their arguments, personal pronouns are in principle necessary to distinguish between different persons and numbers. Thus, Lezgian is
not a pronoun-dropping (""pro-drop"") language. The examples in (1117) represent the standard case of coreference expressed by the personal pronoun of
the third person.

Lezgian and its speakers2.1. The Lezgians
The Lezgians live in an area of about 5000 km 2 in southern Daghestan and
northern Azerbaijan, in the high mountain area of the eastern Caucasus
and in the plains between the mountains and the Caspian sea. In addition,
there is a sizable Lezgian diaspora in many major cities of the former Soviet
Union.
According to the 1989 census, there were 466 000 Lezgians in the Soviet
Union. Since the rate of language retention for the Lezgians is around 90
percent, the number of speakers of Lezgian must be well over 400 000.
Most Lezgians live in villages where they make a living out of agriculture (especially in the plains) and stockbreeding (especially in the mountains). The Lezgians have traditionally been Sunni Muslims, and until the
incorporation of Daghestan and Azerbaijan into the Russian empire in the
19th century, their further cultural contacts were mainly with the Ottoman
empire and with Persia. Both the older contacts with the Oriental world and
the more recent contacts with Russia are reflected by large numbers of loans
in the Lezgian language.
2.1.1. Population figures

347 556 (90.8%)The language retention rate is 100 % in the Lezgian villages of Daghestan,
but in the Daghestanian cities (espacially Maxaikala) and in the diaspora the
language tends to be lost in favor of the dominating Russian by younger
people.
The main potential inaccuracy in the census data concerns the Lezgians
in Azerbaijan. They have been undergoing a process of (apparently sometimes forced) assimilation to the Azerbaijanis, and since identification as
Lezgian can be disadvantageous in Azerbaijan, it is possible that many
Lezgians were counted as Azerbaijanis. The number of Daghestanian
Lezgians is somewhat higher than the number of Lezgians in Azerbaijan:

Federation outside of Daghestan, 13 905 (3.0%) live in Kazakhstan, and
10 425 Lezgians (2.2%) live in Turkmenia.
More detailed figures are available for the 1979 census (CSU 1984). In 1979,
347 556 Lezgians (90.8%) gave Lezgian as their native language, 18 069 (4.7%)
gave Russian as their native language, and 16 986 (4.4%) gave some other
native language (mainly Azerbaijani, cf. below). 3 452 Lezgians said they
speak Lezgian in addition to their (non-Lezgian) native language (9.8% of
those whose native language is not Lezgian). 181 969 Lezgians (47.6%) said
they know Russian.
Within Daghestan, 185 563 of the 188 804 Lezgians (98.3%) gave Lezgian as
their native language, 1922 (1.0%) gave Russian, and 1190 (0.6%) gave another Daghestanian language as their native language. 121 486 Daghestanian
Lezgians (64.3%) know Russian, and 489 Daghestanian Lezgians (0.3%)
know another Daghestanian language.
Within Azerbaijan, 134 873 of the 158 057 Lezgians (85.3%) gave Lezgian
as their native language, 14 426 (9.1%) gave Azerbaijani, and 8571 (5.4%)
gave Russian. 73 613 Azerbaijanian Lezgians (46.6%) know Azerbaijani, and
37 184 (23.5%) know Russian.
2.1.2. Geographical location
Lezgian is spoken in an area of about 5 000 km 2 in southern Daghestan and
in northern Azerbaijan (""Lezgistan"").
In Daghestan, the Kuraxskij, Sulejman-Stal'skij (formerly Kasumkentskij), Magaramkentskij, and Axtynskij rayons are completely occupied by
Lezgians. Some Lezgians also live in the adjacent Rutul'skij and Xivskij
rayons. In Azerbaijan, the Lezgians live in the Kusarskij, Kubinskij,
Xudatskij, KutkaSenskij and Kunaxkentskij rayons.
Further geographical details can be found on the map on the following
page (adapted from Mejlanova 1964).
2.1.3. Some remarks on Lezgian history
References to a Daghestanian people Legoi, Lekoi or Geloi can be found in
several ancient writers (Herodotus, Strabo, Pliny the Elder). This probably
refers to the Daghestanian peoples in general. Arab authors of the 9th and
10th centuries mention a kingdom Lakz in southern Daghestan.
In the 7th and 8th centuries Daghestan was conquered by the Arabs. As a
consequence of this, the Daghestanian population was converted to Islam in
the following centuries.
In the 18th century, feudal relations replaced the older free peasant communities in many places. Lezgians became part of the Quba khanate in the
southeast, of the Derbent khanate in the northeast, and of the Kazikumux
khanate in the northwest. In 1812 the Küre khanate was founded in the

Samur river (with the administrative center in Q'urah/Kurax). The
southeastern areas (along the valley of the middle Samur river) did not
belong to a feudal territory, but consisted of associations of independent
peasant communities (vol'nye obSiestva, 'free communities') such as Axtypara, Alty-para, Doquz-para, and Rutul.
The incorporation of Daghestan into the Russian empire began in the
early 19th century. Because of the fierce resistance of part of the population,
it was not until the 1860s that all of Daghestan was under Russian control.
After the defeat of the Daghestanian resistance, many Lezgians were forced
to emigrate and settled in Turkey (cf. Moor 1985 on Lezgian villages in
Turkey).
The Küre khanate was transformed into the Kjurinskij okrug of the
Daghestanian oblast' (center in Q'asumxür/Kasumkent). The free communities along the middle Samur became the Samurskij okrug. The Quba
khanate became the Kubinskij uezd of the Baku gubernija.
The economy of the Lezgians has traditionally been based on agriculture
and stockbreeding. Agriculture is most widespread in the eastern plains region, whereas the western mountain region supports practically only sheepbreeding (cf. AgaSirinova (1978: Ch. 1) on the traditional Lezgian economy).
In the late 1920s, a standard written language was introduced, and teaching of Lezgian in schools and regular publication activities in Lezgian began
(cf. 2.3.).
After 1929 agriculture in Daghestan was collectivized. By the 1960s, electricity was brought to most of the villages. Several mountain villages were
resettled in more accessible places, some of them quite distant from their
original location (e.g. the village KuruS in the Axtynskij rayon was resettled
in the Xasavjurtovskij rayon, 300 km from the original location).
The liberalization of the Gorbachev years led to a revival of Lezgian national self-awareness. The Lezgian national movement Sadwal (""Unity"")
was founded in 1990. Lezgians living far from Lezgistan are increasingly interested in preserving their national heritage. The territorial division of
Lezgistan between Daghestan and Azerbaijan is seen as a big problem by
many Lezgians.
After the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991/92, the Lezgians found
themselves in two different countries: Russia (of which Daghestan is a part)
and Azerbaijan.
2.1.4. The ethnonym Lezgian
The word Lezgian
corresponds to the Lezgian self-designation lezgi
'Lezgian' (Russian lezginskij, lezgin). This term has been used in the present
sense since the 1920s. Before that, the term Lezgian had been used to refer to
all non-Turkic mountain peoples of Daghestan, while the term Küre (or
Kilri, Russian kjurinskij) was used for the people and the language that are
now called Lezgian (cf. Uslar 1896). (Küre is more properly the name of the
Lezgian dialect spoken in the eastern plains, the region most accessible to
outsiders.)
Various spelling variants of Lezgian
have been used in English
(Lezghian, Lezgi, Lesghian, Lezgin, etc.). The variant Lezgian is chosen

"14.4. Word order in the noun phrase
Noun phrases are strictly head-final. All types of modifiers precede their
head: quantifiers (see 14.2.), appositions (see 14.3.), demonstratives (cf. 683),
adjective phrases (cf. 684), Genitive NPs (cf. 685), and relative clauses (see
19.1.).

The order of noun modifiers with respect to each other is relatively free,
and the generalizations below reflect only the orders that are used most
commonly. Native speakers tend to accept most possible orders. In many
cases there may be semantic differences between different orders (e.g. reflecting different scope relations), but they are too subtle to be described here.
14.4.1. The position of the Genitive NP
The Genitive NP generally precedes all other modifiers because otherwise
those modifiers could be taken as modifying the Genitive noun rather than
its head. In example (686), the Genitive NP precedes an adjective (a), a
demonstrative (b), a quantifier (c), a numeral (d), and even a relative clause
(e) (but see 14.4.2. for the order of relative clauses).

However, two types of Genitive NPs prefer a position closer to the head
noun: short pronominal Genitives (cf. 687) and non-referential Genitive
modifiers that correspond to English first compound members and to
Russian relational adjectives (cf. 688).

All these examples are syntactically ambiguous, but since the other reading
is extremely unlikely in (687) (personal pronouns are hardly ever modified),
and non-referential Genitives form fixed expressions with their head nouns
in (688), the danger of confusion is small.
When a plausible meaning results, two Genitive NPs may modify the
same head noun:
(689) a. öiawe:GEN t h a t6'aw.a-n predsedatel'
time-GENchairperson(R66:12)'our chair of that time'
b. ziI:GENgat.u-nsummer-GENkanikul-arvacation-PL(M83:64)'my summer vacations'
14.4.2. The position of the relative clauseThe participial relative clause is generally the first constituent of its NP because of its heaviness. If other modifiers preceded the relative clause, these
would be relatively far away from their head nouns. E.g.
(690) wa-ltapSurmiS-da-j[you-SRESS entrust-FUT-PTP]sa c'iji kar (E56:14)
one newjob'a new job that will be entrusted to you'
When this preference is in conflict with the preference that the Genitive NP
should be the first constituent of the NP (14.4.1.), both orders are possible,
and the order which causes least ambiguity in the context wins out.","[279, 280, 281]"

7.2.2.1. The Absolutive case. Lezgian is ergative in the standard way: The
Absolutive noun phrase is the single argument of an intransitive verb (136)
or the patient/theme argument of a transitive verb (137).

The Absolutive case is also used with noun phrases in predicate nominal
function (cf. 17.1.):
(138) Jugdaynäninightxa-na. (K88,9:5)
become-AOR'The day became night.'
Some nouns denoting a span of time are used in the Absolutive to express
duration:

The Absolutive case is used for vocative noun phrases:
(140) Can

sleepgalama-t(A90:39)be.behind.still-NEG'Dear grandmother, I am not tired anymore.'
Finally, the Absolutive case has a number of special uses: (a) partitive
phrases (cf. 14.2.2.), (b) apposition (cf. 14.3.), argument of the postposition
patal (12.2.2.4.).
7.2.2.2. The Ergative case. The Ergative case marks the agent argument of
transitive verbs.

Noun morphology7.1. Nominal inflection
7.1.1. Plural formation
The plural is generally formed with the stress-attracting suffix -Ar or its
stress-neutral variant -ar (7.1.1.1.-4.). Minor patterns are described below in
7.1.1.5.-9.
7.1.1.1. The default plural suffix is stress-neutral -ar. Almost all polysyllabic
nouns (with the exception of the cases mentioned in 7.1.1.6.) form their plural in -ar. E.g.
muhmdn
balk'dn
ρβηϊέΓmuhmdn-ar
balk'dn-ar
pen&r-ar'guests'
'horses'
'windows'7.1.1.2. Nouns ending in a vowel (regardless of the number of syllables) also
form their plural in -ar, but a j is inserted to avoid the hiatus. E.g.
didi
giizgii'
lididi-jar
güzgii '-jar
li-jar'mothers'
'mirrors'
'hides'7.1.1.3. Most monosyllabic nouns that end in a consonant form their plural in -Ar, i.e. -ar or -er as determined by Palatal Vowel Harmony (4.4.1.) (for
exceptions see 7.1.1.4.-5., 7.1.1.7.-8.). E.g.
tar
tum
pel
gil
giiltar-dr
tum-dr
pel-ir
gil-έΓ
ffil-ir'trees'
'tails'
'foreheads'
'hands'
'husbands'This pattern also applies to many monosyllabic loanwords, e.g.
'parks', fil-är 'elephants'.park-dr7.1.1.4. Many monosyllabic loanwords take the default suffix -ar, e.g.
pek
tek
tipp4k-ar
t4k-ar
tip-ar'silk'
'unit'
'type'A few native monosyllabic nouns also show this suffix:

'faces'
'enclosure'
'shed'A diachronic explanation has been given for these cases: These words used
to be disyllabic but lost their first syllable (Zirkov 1941:48).
7.1.1.5. A few monosyllabic nouns with a back stem vowel form their plural
idiosyncratically in -ir:
kal
kac
k 'ankal-ir
kac-4r
k'an-ir'cows'
'cats'
Tjottoms'Likewise: k'waö 'foot', k'wal 'house', qwan 'stone', wan 'voice', kul 'bush,
bunch', k'ul 'shoulder', xwal 'ditch, furrow'. As 2irkov (1941:48) observes, it
is striking that most of these nouns begin with a voiceless velar or uvular
consonant.
7.1.1.6. Nouns derived with the suffix -wal (cf. 7.3.1.1.) form their plural in
-er.
Säd-wal
Säd-wil-er
'lit. joys'
zumärt-wal
iumärt-wil-er
'lit. generosities'
7.1.1.7. A few monosyllabic nouns have the suffix -lAr, i.e. -lar or -ler as determined by Palatal Vowel Harmony.

groups. This provides a clue for the diachronic origin of -Arar: In such
nouns it was natural for the plural to be reinterpreted as the basic form, to
which another plural suffix -ar was then attached. However, the old monosyllabic basic forms continue to exist as singulars in these cases.

7.1.2. Case formation
7.1.2.1. Introduction. There are eighteen cases in Lezgian: four grammatical
ones (Absolutive, Ergative, Genitive, Dative) and fourteen local cases divided into five localizations (Ad, Post, Sub, Super, In), each of which has
three locatives (Essive, Elative, Directive) One combination, the ""InDirective"", is missing, so there are only 3 χ 5 - 1 = 14 combinations.
To start with a concrete example, the singular inflection of sew 'bear' is:

individual cases see 7.2.2. Note that the specific local relations that were
originally expressed by the local cases are now generally expressed by postpositions, while the local cases mainly express more abstract senses.
The main difficulty is the formation of the oblique stem from the simple
stem (7.1.2.2.). Otherwise case inflection is straightforward and regular for all
declinable words (except for a few irregularities in pronouns, cf. 11.1.). The
Absolutive case is identical to the basic stem, and the Ergative case is identical to the oblique stem. The Genitive and Dative cases are formed by adding
-n and -z, respectively, to the oblique stem. The localizations are formed
from the oblique stem by adding their characteristic consonants -w (Ad), -qh
(Post), -k (Sub), respectively, and the Elative and Directive suffixes -aj and
-di are added to the localization suffixes. Only the In localization (7.1.2.3.)
and the Super localization (7.1.2.4.) require further comment.

Farid

'Farid'
Cexov

This is also true for native personal names derived from common nouns.
These have a different oblique stem when they are used as common nouns,
e.g. cilkw-er 'flowers', obi. ciikw-er-i; but Cilkwer (female personal name),
obi. Ciikwer-a. The suffix -a also occurs in the oblique variant of the substantivizing suffix (8.1.1.), e.g.jaru-di 'red one (Absolutive)', oblique stem
jaru-da.
The oblique stem suffix -a is also used in a small number of common
nouns, e.g.
apaj
q'üzekobi. apaj-a
obi. q'iizek-a'father-in-law'
'old man'(C) Abstract nouns derived with -wal (7.3.1.1.) and Masdars (verbal
nouns, 9.3.1.1.) in -(u)n form their oblique stem in -i.

balk'an-ar
buba-jar
dag-larobi. balk'dn-r-i
obi. bubd-jr-i
obi. dag-ldr-i'horses'
'fathers'
'mountains'There are a few non-derived nouns that take the oblique suffix -i in the singular. Some of them end in -(u)n or -r, which suggests that they represent
old lexicalized Masdar forms and former pluralia tantum which have been
reanalyzed as singulars.

Pronouns11.1. Personal pronouns
The personal pronouns are: 1SG zun T , 2SG wun 'you', 1PL tun 'we', and 2PLkiln 'you-all'.
The 2PL pronoun kiin is sometimes used as a form of polite address, apparently under the influence of Russian.
For the 3rd person, the demonstrative am (lit. 'that one') is used (cf. 11.4.,
22.1.).
The case inflection of the 1st and 2nd person pronouns shows a few irregularities in the Absolutive, Ergative, and Genitive cases. Also, the
oblique stem on which the Dative and the local cases are based is not identical with the Ergative case.

These personal pronouns are the only series of personal pronouns. There
is no distinction between 'lighf and 'heavy' (or 'reduced'/'full', 'clitic 7 /'free')
pronouns.
As Lezgian lacks verb agreement, the use of personal pronouns is in principle obligatory in finite clauses such as Za-z wun akuna Ί saw you' (not:
*akuna). In practice, however, the personal pronouns are often omitted
when they are recoverable from the context (cf. 22.1.).","[203, 204]"

Besides the suffixes mentioned in this section, there are various participial
suffixes which derive participles (=verbal adjectives) from verbs. Since participles are part of the verbal paradigm, they are considered inflectional affixes and are described in Ch. 9 (9.3., 9.3.3.2., 9.9.2., 9.10.4.).

frequent and productive adjective-forming affixes in Lezgian. They are

Verbal inflection
9.1. Introduction
There are two morphological verb classes, strong verbs and weak verbs.
Strong verbs are stressed on the thematic vowel (i.e., on the syllable following the verb base), e.g. rax-ύ-η 'talk', whereas weak verbs are stressed on the
base and do not have a thematic vowel, e.g. kis-un 'fall silent' (the citation
form of verbs is the Masdar, which ends in -n/-un).
The verbal inflectional suffixes can be divided into three groups depending on the form of the stem to which they are attached. The three stems,
which are called Masdar stem, Imperfective stem, and Aorist stem here, are
distinguished only in strong verbs. In weak verbs all three coincide with the
base. The following partial paradigms illustrate this (see below 9.3., 9.4. for
more complete paradigms):

"11.3. Correlations between demonstratives, interrogatives and

specifically indefinite stem. From each of these stems, a whole series of proforms are formed.

are not connected with these stems, are described in 11.4. - 11.6. Here only
the forms derived from these stems will be discussed.
In Table 5, examples are given only for the two most frequent demonstrative stems, i- and α-, and for the interrogative and indefinite stems. The
other four demonstrative stems (at'a-, ha-, aga-, wini-) have the same
forms exhibited by the two demonstratives i- and a-. These forms are omitted from Table 5 for lack of space.

'whereabout?''in some places'Table 5 shows that the patterns for forming pro-forms from these stems are
quite regular. Only the stem sa differs in the way it forms its substantivized
form (suffixing of -d rather than -m, cf. 13.1.1.), and in that it lacks forms
corresponding to i&tin and iq'wan.
The words iMin, iq'wan, etc., denoting quality and quantity, respectively,
are obviously related to the comparative particles xtin 'as, like' and q'wan
'as much/many as' (cf. 24.2.2.-3.).
The presentative -nhe does not combine with the interrogative stem, but
it does combine with the other demonstratives (at'anhe, etc.).
The local pro-adverbs can all be considered as derived from a place noun

ina 'here' is the regular Inessive case, iniz is the regular Dative case, inaj is
the regular Inelative case, etc. In fact, many more forms than those that are
listed in Table 5 are possible. There is also a Postessive iniqh 'hither', an

also further plural forms like inriz 'to hereabouf.
While there is no noun *in (pi. *in-ar) 'this place', from which all these
local case forms could be regularly derived, there is in fact a ""local noun""
charecterized by the suffix -nag (pi. -nag-ar) in the Absolutive case, e.g.
at'anag 'yonder place', wininag '(that) upper place', etc. The local adverbs
can be analyzed as derived from an irregular oblique stem of this word. Here
are two examples for the use of the local noun.
(435) a. Inagqeninjiq.a-lajwimakanja. (AM87:13)t h i s . p l a c e today'sday-SRELyou:GENdwellingCOP'From today on this place is your dwelling.'
b. Insan-r.ipeople-PL(HRG)anag-arthat.place-PLbag-lar.i-z-nigarden-PL-DAT-andnik'-er.i-zfield-PL-DATelqiir-da.
turn-FUT'People will turn those places into gardens and fields.' (L86,3:17)
Besides the eight demonstrative, interrogative, and indefinite stems considered above, there are a few other stems that can have local adverbs of this
kind. In particular, the universal quantifier wiri 'all' has a corresponding local noun wir inag
'every place', as well as local case forms like
wirina / wirinra 'everywhere', wirinaj 'from everywhere', etc. The identity
pronouns masa 'other' and miikii 'the other' also have forms like masana
'elsehwere', miikixna 'at the other place'.
Finally, the plural personal pronouns tun 'we' and kiln 'you-all' have local case forms of the kind described here: öina 'at our place', küna 'at your
place', öiniz 'to our place', kü'niz 'to your place' etc. These forms are based
on the Genitive case forms 6i 'our' and kii 'your'. Note in particular that the
case forms of Hun and kiln are quite different from the above-mentioned
secondary local-noun-based case forms, cf.

experiencer or other roles that are typically filled by human referents.

The antecedent may also be within the relative clause part of a cleft sentence
(cf. 19.4.):

COP:PSTWhat he saw were the walls and the roof of their poor cabin.'
And the antecedent may be the Genitive modifier of a noun phrase when
the reflexive pronoun occurs within the noun phrase, e.g.

the antecedent may occupy. While it is possible to maintain in most of the
cases above that the antecedent is a subject or a quasi-subject, this is completely impossible in the following cases.
(1149) a. ISttin äadwal
[suchpleasureöin-a-niface-INESS-alsowiH-Zi-niAu-n.i-kdiRahman.a-niSad qhwerhat-na. (J89:21)self-DAT-also become-MSD]-SBDIR Rahman-GENglad smileappear-AOR'Since such a pleasure had also happened to him, a happy smile

Daghestan.'
In both cases the controller is a Genitive NP used attributively within another NP and therefore a very unlikely syntactic (quasi-)subject. But note
that the head noun on which the controller NP depends refers to a mental
situation which is spelled out in the rest of the sentence. The controller NP
is therefore pragmatically very salient, so any generalization concerning
possible controllers of reflexivization in Lezgian must refer to pragmatic factors, or perhaps to the semantic factor 'human/non-human'.
Sometimes the antecedent of the reflexive pronoun is even in object position:
(1150) a. Tagi=xaluwiöi-nTagi=unclefikir-r.iself-GEN thought-PL(ERG)ak'ai-nawa-j.torment-PRF-PST(J89:32)'Uncle Tagi was tormented by his thoughts.'

This is only possible when the antecedent is animate and no other possible
antecedent exists in the clause.

The reflexive pronoun may be in any position of the clause that is not occupied by the antecedent. It may be an immediate constituent of the clause:
(1151) a. Ali.diwiögata-zwa.","[430, 431, 432]"
"22.4. Reflexivization
The usual means for marking coreference within a clause are the reflexive
pronouns (11.2.): wit for 3rd person singular, 6eb for 3rd person plural, zuw
for 1st and 2nd person singular. As in the case of coreferential omission, the
precise syntactic conditions for the use of reflexive pronouns are not easy to
determine, and a lot depends on the pragmatics.
22.4.1. Syntactic function of the antecedent
The antecedent of the reflexive pronoun must occupy a prominent syntactic
position. For instance, it cannot be the direct object or a possessor when the
reflexive pronoun is the subject:
(1139) a. *Wi6iAligata-zwa.self(ERG) A l i beat-IMPF'Himself is beating Ali.'
b. *Wiöi-zself-DATAli.di-nAli-GENruS-ardaughter-PLaku-na.see-AOR'Himself saw Ali's daughters.'

a non-subject argument or a noun modifier. Example (1140) shows an
Absolutive subject antecedent, and (1141) shows Ergative subject antecedents.

"1.3. A user's guide to this grammar
This book is intended as a reference grammar of Lezgian for linguists who
wish to learn more about Lezgian grammar as a whole or about particular
aspects of it.
Since it was written for linguists, the grammar presupposes familiarity
with a large number of fundamental grammatical notions which greatly facilitate the concise formulation of grammatical regularities. However, it
contains no framework-specific jargon, idiosyncratic formalisms, or other
unnecessary obstacles.
1.3.1. User-friendly features
An attempt has been made to make this grammar maximally user-friendly
even for readers who need a particular piece of information (e.g. for a crosslinguistic investigation) and have no time to wade through the whole
grammar. This grammar has the following features that make it easy to use
as a reference work:
(A) Morpheme-by-morpheme glosses with brackets marking subordinate
clauses for better readability (cf. 1.3.5.).
(B) A detailed subject index which, in addition to normal entries referring
to places in the book, contains entries that do not occur elsewhere in the
book. Such entries are names of grammatical phenomena that do not occur
in the language. Thus, looking up the subject index suffices to find out that
Lezgian has no passive, no dual, no tones. There are of course no negative
statements about these categories in the grammar, and since the mere absence of a category in the index proves nothing, the negative information in
the index might be useful.
(C) An index to the example sentences. Since the examples (most of
which were taken from original Lezgian texts) usually show other interesting phenomena in addition to the point which they illustrate in the particular place in the text, such an index makes a lot of additional information
available. By looking up the number of an example in the index, the reader

(D) A more or less complete bibliography of scholarly works on Lezgian.
Most of these are not mentioned in the text, but a reader who is interested
in further information or different points of view is given the chance to
look them up. The subject index simultaneously serves as an index to the
bibliography. This step was taken so as not to clutter the text with references
that few readers will find useful because most of the publications are difficult to get outside of Daghestan.
(E) An index to the grammatical morphemes of Lezgian.
1.3.2. Structure of the grammar
The structure of this grammar follows the well-established traditional order:
phonology — morphology — syntax — texts. This ensures that the amount
of information that is presupposed in a given section but comes later in the
book is minimized.
The morphological chapters deal with the form and the meaning of the
grammatical items of the language. For inflectional categories, the inflection
as a whole is first described, followed by a description of the meanings of the
individual inflectional categories. For derivational categories, form and
meaning are treated together.
While the morphology takes the analytical perspective (from form to
function), the syntax takes the synthetic perspective (from function to form),
with chapter topics such as coordination, relative clauses, complement
clauses, adverbial clauses, coreference, questions, and comparison. All these
are taken as functional notions. For example, participial relative clauses and
correlative relative clauses show no formal similarities, but they are treated
together in Ch. 19 because of their similar function.
Thus, this grammar to some extent fulfills the theoretical requirement to
present the grammatical information both from an analytical and from a
synthetic perspective (von der Gabelentz 1901, Lehmann 1980). For example,
the functions of the Dative case are described twice: First from an analytical
perspective in the chapter on nominal inflection (7.2.2.4.); and then from a
synthetic perspective in the sections on verbal valence (15.3.2., 15.4.1.), on
adjectival valence (14.5.1.1.), and on spatial and temporal adverbials
(16.3.1.1., 16.3.2.1.). Similarly, the functions of the Aorist converb are described twice: First in the chapter on verbal inflection (9.9.4.), and then in
the sections on adverbial clauses (21.1.) and on complement clauses (20.6.1.2.). Sometimes only cross-references are made to avoid unnecessary repetitions.
However, this grammar, too, has an analytical bias. Not everything is described from a synthetic point of view. For example, there is no function-toform treatment of tense meanings, or of number meanings. For such phenomena, the form-to-function description must suffice.","[28, 29]"

7.2.1. Functions of the plural
The plural indicates plurality of objects, e.g. ktab 'book', ktab-ar
'books'.
(Note that the singular is used when the noun is modified by a cardinal
numeral, e.g. wad ktab 'five books' (*wad ktabar); cf. 13.1.1.)
However, the plural can also be formed from non-count nouns, and then
the meaning it conveys is not so straightforward. Examples are:
(125) rug
nek
q'el
wirt
mürqhrukwar
nek'er
q'eler
wirt'er
mürqher'dusf
'milk'
'salt7
'honey'
'rust'The plural of such nouns is rarely used, and it seems to imply a great
quantity, e.g.
(126) Nek'-erbulAu-raj.abundant be-OPT
'May the milk be abundant.'
Plurals can also be formed from nouns denoting unique objects (127) and
from nouns denoting abstract concepts (128), as well as from surnames (129).

stxawalzumartwiler

'brotherhood'(129) ArabovArabovar'the Arabovs (i.e. the family)'There are also a number of pluralia tantum in Lezgian. They mostly denote substances or diseases, cf. (130). Russian pluralia

tantum must not be confused with nouns in -ar/-er
that
take the oblique suffix -i in the singular, e.g. gurar 'stairs', purar 'saddle',
meqher 'wedding' (7.1.2.2. (C)). These are apparently old pluralia
tantum,
but synchronically they behave like ordinary singular nouns and take the
plural suffix -ar (gurarar 'staircases', purarar 'saddles', meq^erar

suffix (*jararar), they also show plural agreement with substantivized predicative adjectives (8.1.1.3.), e.g.

There are a few pluralia
tantum that show mixed behavior, e.g. surar
'cemetery7 (sur 'grave'), regwer 'mill' (regw 'mill, millstone'). These denote
countable objects, but they do not take the plural suffix yet ( * s u r a r a r ,
*regwerar). They do, however, combine with quantifiers, e.g.
(133) a. saonesurarcemetery'one cemetary'
b. gzaf

agreement.

11.5.1. wui 'who?' has the suppletive oblique stem n-i- (Erg. ni, Dat. niz, etc.,

11.5.2. wuö 'what?' has the suppletive oblique stem k(w)-ü- or kwe- (/kw/)
(Erg. kü, Dat. kiiz/kwez, etc., Iness. kwe).
In addition to its use as a substantival pronoun, wuö can also be used adjectivally with the meaning 'which?, what kind of?' In this function it is
more or less synonymous with hi.

Another feature that contributes to the user-friendliness of this grammar is
the avoidence of opaque grammatical category labels such as ""5th Elative
case"" or ""3rd Past tense"". Instead, grammatical labels with some mnemonic
descriptive content have been chosen, such as ""Superelative case"" and ""Past
Perfect"". This meant that traditional Lezgian terminology had to be abandoned in several cases. However, the traditional terminology itself is by no
means uniform. For example, Gajdarov's (1987a) textbook differs substantially from the earlier standard accounts of Talibov & GadZiev (1966) and
Mejlanova (1967). Other works such as Zirkov (1941) and Moor (1985) use
still different terms.
The following table is a comparative list of the most important terms that
are most widespread in Russian-language studies of Lezgian and of the terminology used in this grammar (my terminology is closest to Mel'iuk's
1988a).","[29, 30]"
"Baku-INESS [know-FUT-PST] one person-even be.in-NEG-PST'Weled did not have anyone [he] knew in Baku.' (S88:5)

about, but [I] was shy and [I] didn't ask.'
The examples above are from relative clauses. Omission of personal pronouns in adverbial clauses, especially converbal adverbial clauses, is even
more common. Looking at Lezgian from the point of view of Russian or
English, pronoun dropping in relative clauses is unexpected, while coreferential omission in converbal clauses is natural because Russian and English
converbs require coreferential omission. Cf.:

c. ?? He having said goodbye...
But it seems that from the point of view of Lezgian, anaphoric omission of
the type seen in (1118M1121) is the same phenomenon as omission of the
type in (1122a). There seems to be a difference in the extent to which personal pronouns and reflexive pronouns are omitted: More commonly in
converbal clauses, less commonly in relative clauses and in main clauses.
But I know of no evidence for a difference in the grammatical status of these
types of omission. It is important to note that the use of a pronoun is never
excluded (unlike in English or Russian). For instance, in the following sentence the subject of the subordinate clause might well have been
dropped/omitted, but it is present.

Adjectival adverbs are also used copredicatively, i.e. modifying a noun
phrase rather than the verb.

Adjectival adverbs resemble the Imperfective converb of verbs (-z, cf.
9.3.2.1., 9.9.3.) not just formally. The two also show intriguing functional
similarities. Thus, the adjectival adverb may be used as a kind of complement of the verb akun 'see', much like verbal converb forms (20.6.2.).
(263) Abur.u-z har
they-DATeverysadeq'iq'aone minutebaha-zdear-ADVakwa-zwa-j.see-IMPF-PST(J89:24)'Every minute seemed valuable to them.'
Furthermore, both adjectival adverbs and converbs are used with the local copula ama 'be still' (17.6.6.1.), and adjectival adverbs may be reduplicated, like the Imperfective converb (21.2.):

8.1.2.2. Minor adverb suffixes. The suffix -k'a forms adjectival adverbs from
a small number of adjectives, e.g.:

be regarded as an adverb-forming suffix. It is really the Superdirective case

the corresponding adverb in -dakaz, e.g.:

8.1.3.1. The predicative suffix -da. The Lezgian grammatical literature mentions a suffix -da that can be attached to adjectives and gives them a predicative function (Uslar 1896:93-95,190-194; GadZiev 1954:48; Ramaldanov 1980).
There is also a corresponding Past tense form -da-j.
(271) öimi
meq 'i
q^san
giSin
Sirin'warm'
'cold'
'good'
'hungry'
'sweet'öimida
meq'ida
qhsanda
giSinda
Sirinda'(it) is warm'
'(it) is cold'
'is good'
'is hungry'
'is sweet'This suffix is not used in the modern standard language, except in the
cases k'anda 'wants', öida 'knows', t'ada 'hurts', kiö'eda 'fears' (9.5.2.1.-4.),
which are treated as verbs in this grammar.
The Future suffix -da is clearly also related to predicative -da and to -da
in k'an-da etc. The most likely scenario that relates these three instances of
-da is the following: -da is originally a copula, closely related etymologically
to the standard copula ja and the local copulas aw a etc. (d/j are originally
different gender markers, and aw- etc. are preverbs). It was suffixed to adjectives, yielding forms as in (271) and to (some kind of participial form of)
verbs, yielding a general present tense which was later restricted to habitual
and future uses (9.3.2.4.). Adjectival forms as in (271) then fell into disuse,
surviving only in forms like k'anda etc. (which had become verbs).
Most examples of predicative -da that are given in the sources are from
adjectives denoting environmental and psychological states, often lacking a
subject (or at least an Absolutive subject).

However, some other adjectives are also mentioned:

c. Inahereö'urpastureqacu-da.green-PRED(Uslar 1896:94)'Here the pasture is green.'
8.1.3.2. The Imperfective suffixes -z(a)wa/-z(a)ma on adjectives. The verbal
Imperfective suffix -z(a)wa and the Continuative Imperfective suffix z(a)ma (cf. 9.3.2.2.-3.) are occasionally used as predicative suffixes on adjectives. This use seems to be restricted to adjectives ending in a vowel or -τι,
which is not surprising in view of the following considerations: The
Imperfective in verbs is based on the Imperfective converb -(i)z plus awa (>
-z(a)wa). The adjectival form that corresponds to the verbal Imperfective
converb in several respects is the adjectival adverb in -dizl-z (8.1.2.), but
this has the form -z only in adjectives ending in a vowel or -n. Thus, an adjectival Imperfective form can arise in a similar manner only in these adjectives:
(274) a. Verbal Imperfective:
Imperfective converb + awa
fi-z awa
> fizwa
'is going'
kilig-iz awa
> kilig-zawa

b. Adjectival Imperfective: adjectival adverb (-z) + awa
6imi-z awa
> öimizwa
'is warm'
giSin-z awa
> giSinzawa
'is hungry7
The few examples of the use of the adjectival Imperfective are mostly
from the same type of adjectives that take the predicative suffix -da (8.1.3.1.),
i.e. adjectives denoting environmental and psychological states.
(275) a. Ada-z gi§in-zawa

pharyngealized to a greater or lesser degree (Kodzasov 1986:33-34,
Mejlanova 1964). Most roots in which it occurs are loans of Arabic origin
with an Arabic pharyngeal consonant (Ϊ or h)), e.g.:

manfaiat/ae/ does not occur at the beginning of words in the standard language. This
may be due to the spelling system (/ae/ is represented by the Cyrillic letter
<H>, which at the beginning of a word has the value /ja/, see 3.1.1.3.). All
words that begin with /ae/ in the Güne dialect begin with /e/ in the standard

marginal status. They occur in those forms of the verbs jagun 'hit' and the
verbs in -ägun in (27) which lose the /κ/ before suffixes beginning with a

compensatory lengthening.

'out of the heart'However, this pronunciation is not obligatory, and a pronunciation closer
to the spelling is also possible, especially in careful speech.
3.2.2. Allophonic variation
3.2.2.1. /aJ has two main allophones which are perceived as rather different
by the speakers: the mid [Λ] and the low [a]. The low [a] occurs before
uvulars and Μ in closed syllables, and [λ] occurs elsewhere (Kodzasov
1990:341). However, the precise phonological conditions for [a] are more
complex and have not been completely determined yet; thus, [a] also
appears in many cases before non-uvular voiceless stops, e.g. lap 'very'
[laph], zak [zakh ] 'under me'. After labialized consonants /a/ is very often
rounded, e.g. k'waC 'foof [k'wo(fh] or [k'otfh].
3.2.2.2. /e/ is pronounced as [ε] in stressed syllables and as [e] or [i] in prestress syllables, especially when followed by Ν in the next syllable. This
variation is the cause of some variation in the spelling: ixtibär ~ extibär
'confidence'; ecigun ~ icigun 'put; build'; etc. In the environment of
labialized consonants /e/ is often pronounced as [0, ce], e.g. ekw 'light' [cekh].

3.3.1. Consonant inventory
See Table 3 on the next page.
In addition to the consonants of the standard language (as given in Table 3),
many dialects have some of the following consonants:
—the voiced alveolar and postalveolar affricates /dz/, /dzw/, and /φ/;
—the postalveolar labialized obstruents /(fw/, /tfhw/, /tf'w/, //w/, /3W/, /<£w/. These
are characteristic of the Samur dialect group. There is even one word in the
standard language with such a consonant: maiw /macfew/, plural mac'war
/ma'tfwar/ 'astragal', as well as the sound-symbolic words c'wärq' 'slap in the
face', ö'wäq'räq' 'click' (Mejlanova 1964:387);
—the voiced uvular stop /g/;
—the voiced velar fricative /γ/;
—the epiglottal fricatives Λ/ and /h/.
The aspirated labialized alveolar affricate /tshw/ is part of the system but is
extremely rare (Mejlanova 1970:40). It occurs at least in the Güne dialect
form /rytshwer/ 'grass snakes' (standard rilcer /rytsher/).
The alveolar affricates /dz/ and /<&/ occur in the Küre dialect group, but in
the other dialects they mostly fell together with /z/ and ITJ, respectively.
According to Mejlanova (1970:38) /z, dz/ and /3, <fe/ are not distinguished in
the standard pronunciation. Here it is not quite clear what the orthoepic
norm is. As in the case of /as/ above, the orthography, which only uses <>κ> /
and <3> z, apparently has an effect on what is considered the standard
pronunciation. In those dialects where /z/ and /dz/ are distinguished, there
are rather few words containing /dz/ (Mejlanova 1970:37), e.g.
(30) /ladz/
/qadz/
/wardz/
/medz/

The recent phonological change of Pretonic High Vowel Syncope has led
to the emergence of quite a few obstruents that are distinctively palatalized
(cf. 4.1.1.). They are not included in the consonant inventory here because
the change is quite recent and all its implications have yet to be worked
out—this is a fruitful area for further research.","[50, 51, 52, 53]"

Comparison24.1. Comparison of inequality
24.1.1. The comparative degree
The comparative degree is expressed by the Superelative case (cf. 7.2.2.15.) on
the standard of comparison. Like all modifiers, the standard of comparison
precedes the parameter of comparison (adjective or adverb). This construction is only possible when the standard of comparison consists of a single
noun phrase. Example (1216) shows adjectives, and (1217) shows adverbs in
the comparative construction.

The explicit standard, i.e. a standard expressed as a number takes the same

cannot be in the Superelative case, it cannot be used in this construction and
a comparative clause (24.1.2.) has to be used. H o w e v e r , in some cases very
similar declinable forms are available, e.g. relative adjectives of temporal
adverbs (cf. 8.2.1.3.), as in (1219), or participial forms of converbal postpositions, as in (1220). N o t e that adjectives and participles have to be substantivized before they can be inflected for case.

(Example (1219) contains the word artux 'more'. This could be considered a

Strictly speaking, (1220) is an example of a comparative clause. The literal
translation w o u l d be: 'It is easier to eat the soup with a spoon than (that)
there is no spoon.'
When the standard of comparison is only implicit in the context, the particle madni 'still' (cf. 13.2.3.) can be used to make the comparative meaning
explicit.

"16.3. Clausal adjuncts
Most of the clausal adjuncts (=adverbials) are described in other places in
this grammar, especially in the sections on the functions of the cases (7.2.2.)
on adverbs (12.1.), on postpositions (12.2.), and on adverbial clauses (Ch. 21).
This section deals with clausal a d j u n c t s f r o m a semantic
(onomasiological, function-to-form) point of view. Since detailed description of the forms and illustration is provided elsewhere, much of this section consists of mere cross-references. It can largely be regarded as a systematic index to the form-to-function parts dispersed over the book where adverbiale are described.
Adverbials can be divided into two main semantic groups: predication
adverbials and sentence adverbials. Predication adverbials are dealt with in
sections 16.3.1.-16.3.3, sentence adverbials in sections 16.3.4.-16.3.5.
16.3.1. Spatial adverbials
Spatial notions can be decomposed into two components: type of location
(e.g. interior, posterior, inferior, etc.) and type of orientation (position,
source, path, direction) (cf. Comrie & Smith 1977). The type of location is expressed by one of the localizations (Ad, Post, Sub, Super, In) or by the stem

Elative, Directive), or by an oblique-case form of a postposition.
Furthermore, there are various spatial adverbs that are often formally identical to postpositions.
Position is expressed by an Essive case or by the basic form of a postposition; source and path are expressed by an Elative case or by an Elative form
of a postposition; direction is occasionally by a Directive case or a Directive
form of a postposition, but it is more commonly expressed in the same way
as position (except in the most general type of location, where direction is
expressed by the Dative case). Below only the expression of position is given

Phonotactics4.1. Vowel syncope
4.1.1. Pretonic High Vowel Syncope
Apparently quite recently a phonological change has taken place in many
dialects (including the dialect on which the standard language is based)
which radically altered the phonotactics of the language: Loss of pretonic
high vowels after voiceless obstruents. This vowel syncope is largely ignored by the standard orthography (thus presumably facilitating its use by
speakers of non-syncope dialects). I will sometimes use the term ""pre-syncope"" here to refer to the state of the language before the loss of the pretonic
high vowels.
In quite a few cases the spelling vacillates — sometimes the high vowel is
written and sometimes it is omitted. In the following examples, the nonstandard (but occurring) spelling is marked by an asterisk (*).

'catkins'The fact that syncopated /i/, /y/, and /u/ are often preserved in the spelling
may be due to the fact that in many cases the relevant contrasts do not disappear together with the vowels, being preserved as secondary articulations
of the preceding obstruent. For instance, the word kifer 'plaits' is pronounced /khJfer/, without the /i/, but with a palatalized preceding consonant
(indicated here by superscript j). Likewise, syncopated /u/ is still reflected in
the labialization of the preceding consonant, e.g. tup'al 'ring': /t hw p'al/; and
syncopated /y/ is still reflected in simultaneous palatalization and labialization of the preceding consonant (indicated here by superscript φ, e.g. küäe
'street': /kh4tfe/ (this description is due to Kodzasov 1990:341-42). However,
retention of residual secondary articulations is not very regular, or its conditions are obscure.

means that theoretically one would have to add more than a dozen palatalized and labialized-palatalized obstruent phonemes to the consonant inventory. This is not done here because the change of vowel syncope is very recent and more research is needed to determine precisely all its implications.
However, this preservation of the high vowel contrasts is not possible in
all environments. Distinctive labialization is possible only on consonants
which can be phonemically labialized (see 3.3.1.), and distinctive palatalization is impossible on postalveolar consonants.
The hypothesis that i, u, and ü in the spelling can reflect these residual
secondary articulations (Sandro Kodzasov, p.c.) could also explain a curious
paradox in Uslar (1896), involving the interaction of syncope and Pre-obstruent Unaspirated Aspiration (see 5.4.).
But clearly another factor involved is analogy: Pretonic high vowels are
preserved in the pronunciation and in the spelling much more regularly in
words having a non-syncopated alternant (i.e. in monosyllabic nouns) than
in non-alternating environments. Thus, kic'er 'dogs' and tup'ar 'fingers'
regularly have palatalization/labialization and are spelled with the vowels
because of their singulars (kic' and t'ub) without syncope. Words with syncope in a non-alternating syllable, like ktab 'book', tilfeng/tfeng 'rifle', sufra
'tablecloth', tend to lose the palatalization/labialization in the pronunciation and the vowel letters in the spelling even when the phonological environment would favor their retention.
Between two fricatives, high vowels are not in general syncopated:
(36) SüSe
sühür
sifte/Jy'Je/
/sy'hyr/
/sifte/'glass; bottle'
'magic
'firsfWhen the high vowel comes between an obstruent and a sonorant
(followed by a stressed vowel), the vowel may or may not be syncopated.

way through all environments and lexical items. The rather recent date of
this change seems to justify the strategy (adopted in sections 4.2.1.-2., 6.1.-2.)
of ignoring it for certain purposes.
4.1.2. Post-tonic Vowel Syncope
There is also a tendency for post-tonic vowels in non-final syllables to be
syncopated if they are followed by only one consonant. However, the precise
phonological conditions for this syncope are even more difficult to identify
than for pretonic syncope. Again, the high vowels seem to be most prone to

to be restricted to inflectional suffixes (but cf. 4.1.2.4.).
In this section I will mention mainly the cases that result in alternations
and the cases that showed spelling vacillations before the definitive standardization of the spelling in the 1960s.
4.1.2.1. Post-tonic Vowel Syncope resulted in the alternation between the
Imperfective suffixes -zawa and -zwa (9.3.2.2.), and the Perfect suffixes
-nawa and -nwa
(9.3.3.3.) (as well as the corresponding Continuative
suffixes -zama/ -zma, -nama/-nma).
The Imperfective and the Perfect go
back to periphrastic constructions with the auxiliary verb awa (locative
copula, cf. 17.6.1.), which are still described as periphrastic constructions in
Uslar (1896).
The Imperfective con verb plus awa yielded the Imperfective, and the
Aorist converb plus awa yielded the Perfect (the Continuative tenses are
due to combination with ama 'is still'):

If there are two medial vowels in succession {JM - /a/ in Sexiz awa), the first vowel is dropped, even if this results in a
three-consonant cluster, as in (39).
(39) hdlt-izawa>hdlt-zawa'is meeting'However, in some varieties of the language, the /a/ has been syncopated in
this environment. Forms like (40) are sometimes found in writing
(especially in older texts).

4.2.1. Pre-syncope CV-structure
The syllable structure of Lezgian words was considerably changed by the
rather recent change of Pretonic High Vowel Syncope (4.1.1.). The first two
subsections of this section describe the syllable structure of pre-syncope
Lezgian, and 4.2.3. then describes the present, post-syncope situation.
In pre-syncope Lezgian, only syllables of the type CV, CVC, and CVCC occur. At the beginning of words the consonant may be lacking (#V, #VC,
#VCC). Syllables with a final consonant cluster occur only at the end of a
root morpheme. In the following examples, syllable boundaries are marked
with ""="". The exemplifying syllables are underlined.

handful of exceptions to this generalization, e.g. öigirtma 'kind of dish',
iilcme 'measure', artmisun 'increase'; these are Turkic loanwords containing the Turkic suffixes -mA and -mUs, so that etymologically there is a morpheme boundary between them.)

suffix is attached to a root ending in -CC, e.g.:
(48) baxt-suz
baxt-lu
halt-zawa
halt-na
park-d-a'unhappy'
'happy'
'is meeting'
'met'
'in the park'More than three consonants in a cluster do not occur in Lezgian, since there
are no suffixes beginning with more than one consonant. (The suffixes
-zwa, -zma do occur after stems ending in a vowel, but after stems ending
in one or two consonants their allomorphs -zawa, -zama are used, 4.1.2.1.).
In general, all non-initial syllables begin with exactly one consonant.
However, there are a few Arabic loanwords like dila 'prayer', Sair 'poet', in
which there are vowel-initial medial syllables. These may be pronounced
with a glottal stop (JAylaJ, /Ja?ir/, but the glottal stop may also be omitted.
4.2.2. Pre-syncope morpheme-internal consonant clusters
In this subsection the following abbreviatory conventions are adopted:
Τ stands for an obstruent
L stands for a liquid /l, r/
Ν stands for a nasal /m, n/
W stands for a glide /m, η/
R stands for a sonorant (L, N, W)
Η stands for a laryngeal /h, ?/
In this subsection possible morpheme-internal consonant clusters are described. There are no restrictions on consonant clusters at morpheme
boundaries: Any consonant-initial suffix can attach easily to any consonantfinal stem, without any restrictions or morphophonemic alternations.
The restrictions on possible morpheme-internal consonant clusters are
very different in native Lezgian words and in loanwords. Although most
loanwords are well-integrated and it would not be possible to exclude them
from a phonological description of the language, it seems useful to describe
first the possible consonant clusters of native, Nakho-Daghestanian words.
4.2.2.1. Consonant clusters in native words. The only type of consonant
cluster that is common in native words is /-rT-/, i.e. /r/ plus obstruent, e.g.

all verbs with the preverbs Al-, hAl-, gAl-, etc. (10.3.). So these cases are not
originally morpheme-internal, even though it is in many cases impossible
to identify two separate constituent meanings corresponding to the preverb
and the root.

loanwords is not so much determined by Lezgian grammar as by Arabic,
Turkic, and Persian grammar. For instance, the non-existence of the clusters
*/h?/ and */7h/ in Lezgian is almost certainly due to the non-existence of such
clusters in Arabic. Nevertheless, all the loanwords discussed here are inteBrought to you by | Max-Planck-Gesellschaft - WIB6417

them as well. (Russian loanwords, however, are not included because the
almost universal Lezgian-Russian bilingualism makes it very hard to determine which words are integrated and which words are used in their
Russian form.) Furthermore, not all clusters allowed in Arabic are allowed
in Lezgian: For instance, Arabic words ending in a cluster of the type TR, e.g.
sabr 'patience' cannot appear as such in Lezgian (*sabr), and a vowel must
be inserted: sabur. (However, it may be that the necessary adjustments have
been made in the mediating Turkic language, cf. Turkish sabir; it seems
that there are no consonant clusters in Turkic that are impermissible in
Lezgian.)

As was observed above, Pretonic High Vowel syncope resulted in a rather
drastic change of admissible syllable, structures (Post-tonic Vowel syncope,
4.1.2., had no such effect because it does not apply within roots and is itself
in part dependent on syllable structure.). Whereas only (C)VC syllables used
to be allowed, word-initial CC- and even CCC- clusters are now common,
e.g.ptul 'great-grandchild', Stkana 'swept' (see (33)-(34)).
Such clusters occur only word-initially because the vast majority of
Lezgian words with a syncopatable vowel were stressed on the second syllable, so the syncopatable vowel is virtually always in the first syllable of a
word. (The few words that are stressed on the third and fourth syllable and
have a high vowel in the right environment do not show syncope, e.g.
istismär 'exploitation', haqiqät 'truth, reality'. That there is no syncope in
haqiqät
is also apparent from the lack of Pre-Obstruent Unaspirated
Aspiration (5.4.) in this word.)
Because of the conditions on pretonic syncope, the word-initial CC- clusters consist of two voiceless obstruents (ptul) or a voiceless obstruent and a
sonorant (ö(i)niba 'secretly'), and the CCC- clusters consist either of three
voiceless obstruents, or of two voiceless obstruents and an /r/ between them
(kröargan 'rein', turpar [thwrpar] 'turnips'. The third consonant of the CCCcluster may also be a sonorant to the extent that morpheme-internal obstruent-sonorant clusters are allowed in pre-syncope syllable structure, e.g.
kk'lam 'tick, mite', öxra 'spinning wheel'.","[55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66]"

15.4.1. Valence patterns with a Dative subject argument:
the Affective Construction.
When Dative arguments represent experiencer participants, they play a
privileged role and the case can be made that they are subjects (cf. 16.1.). The
construction with a Dative subject is called the Affective Construction in
Daghestanian linguistics (cf. Alekseev 1975, Sejxov 1986). The special status
of the Dative argument is one of the reasons why valence patterns with
Dative experiencers are given special treatment here. The valence pattern in
(742) is formally identical to the valence pattern in 15.3.2.1., but the two arguments correspond to different semantic roles and show different syntactic

9.9.1. Masdar
The Masdar is conventionally used as the citation form of the verb. Verbs
are listed in dictionaries in this form. The Masdar is an action nominalization. For instance, the verb stem aqwaz- 'stop' has the Masdar aqwaz-un,
which means '(the fact or action of) stopping'.
The Masdar is noun-like only with respect to its external syntax: It can be
inflected for any case (the oblique stem is in -(u)n-i-, cf. 7.1.2.2. (C)), and it
can occur in all environments where NPs can occur. However, in its internal syntax, it behaves completely like a verb. It does not take adjective or
Genitive modifiers or determiners; but it does take adverbial modifiers, and
the verbal arguments appear in the same form as in finite clauses.

could perhaps be described as resulting from conversion (or lexicalization)
of the (verbal) Masdar to a noun. The nominal Masdar is not very common
and is lexicalized only for a limited number of verbs. Nominal Masdars
often have result meaning rather than situation meaning, and unlike the
verbal Masdar, they may be pluralized.

manijar. Manijar luhun is practically a noun-verb compound with the
meaning 'sing'.

"15.5. Free omission of arguments
The arguments specified in a verb's valence pattern must normally be present for the sentence to be grammatical. However, arguments can be omitted under certain conditions. The most common reason for the absence of
an argument is pronoun dropping (22.1.).
In this section I describe cases of missing arguments that cannot be recovered from the discourse context, but that do not involve a different valence
pattern either (thus contrasting with labile verbs, 15.6.).
A very common type of argument omission is the omission of the subject
argument (cf. 16.1. for the notion of 'subject'). The interpretation is 'an unspecified participant' or 'people in general'. When the verb is transitive,
such subjectless sentences are best translated by means of passive sentences:

Not only the Ergative subject of transitive verbs can be freely omitted with
the same interpretation, but also the Absolutive subject of intransitive
verbs. This shows that the omissibility of the Ergative argument in sentences like (778) cannot be due to a special peripheral status of Ergative arguments (as claimed by Mel'iuk 1988). Languages that lack a subjectless pasBrought to you by | Max-Planck-Gesellschaft - WIB6417

"16.2. Word order at the clause level
Like noun-phrase-internal and adjective-phrase-internal word order,
clause-level word order is generally head-final, i.e. verb-final. However,
whereas head-final word order is obligatory in noun phrases and adjective
phrases, verb-final order is only the preferred word order in independent
sentences. Alternative orders are possible, especially in the colloquial language. The order of the other major constituents of the clause (arguments
and adjuncts) is quite free, although there is a strong tendency for the subject to precede the other arguments.

The finite verb is in the sentence-final position in the overwhelming majority of cases, at least in the written standard language. This is illustrated by
(810) and by many other examples in this grammar.
(810) Kamalov.aKamalov(ERG)itim.di-zstol.di-qflman-DATäkatable-POESSqalur-na.p l a c e show-AOR(M90:76)'Kamalov showed the man a seat at the table.'
In subordinate clauses the clause-final position of the verb is practically
obligatory, as illustrated in (811) and in many other examples, especially in
Ch. 19-21.
(811) Xilr-e-wa-jö'exi buba[[village-INESS-be.in-PTP] great f a t h e rata-j-la,come-AOP-TEMP]aq'wanöiniz, seh.er.di-z

am so happy!'
However, there are certain conditions under which non-verb-final order
in independent sentences is possible or even required. One such condition
is in reporting clauses where the object argument represents direct speech.
This appears to be something of a literary convention (much like in
English), but in narrative prose writing it is practically exceptionless. The
reporting verb follows the direct speech immediately, followed by other
constituents of the clause.
(812) a. Bedel,sa[Bedelmanione songlah, —teklif-naAbil.a. (Q81:114)say:IMPV]propose-AORAbil(ERG)'Bedel, sing a song, — proposed Abil.'

— said Rahman, putting his arm on Ali's shoulder.' (J89:27)
This convention is so strong that it is followed even when the reporting
verb is not strictly speaking a speech act verb.

and in emphatic or emotional speech (cf. 816).

"14.3. Apposition
Appositions (NPs that serve as modifiers of nouns and have the same referent as the modified noun) precede their head noun and are always in the
Absolutive case, independently of the case of the head noun.
Most instances of apposition involve a proper name. When the additional information consists of just a single noun, this single noun may be
the head of the NP and the proper name the apposition. The head noun in
this construction is typically a kinship term (673), a title (674), or a noun that
indicates which type of place a toponymic refers to (city, river, etc.) (675).

the Masdar, although much less common. See 20.8.1. for its use in complement clauses. The Causal converb -wiläj (21.5.2.) is originally the Inelative
case of this form.
The suffix -wal is homophonous with the Purpose/Manner converb in
-wal (9.3.4.6.), and it is perhaps etymologically identical with it.
7.3.1.2. -wi. This suffix productively forms nouns of origin from place
names, e.g. axcehwi 'person from Axceh'. This suffix is optionally replaced
by -iuwa in the oblique cases of the singular, so we have:

type NIN2, where the compound denotes the pair constituted by N j and N2.
N i and N2 may belong closely together as a pair (as in (239)), they may represent two particularly salient members of a larger class (as in (240)), or they
may have more or less the same meaning (as in (241)), so that the resulting
compound has roughly the same meaning as N j or N2.

Quantifiers comprise the following classes: (i) cardinal numerals, (ii) partitive phrases, (iii) universal quantifiers (wiri 'all', har sa 'every7), (iv) scalar
quantifiers (t'imil 'little', bäzi 'a few',gzaf 'much, many').
Cardinal numerals are treated in 13.1.1., universal quantifiers in 11.7.1.-2.
Here only scalar quantifiers and partitive phrases are described, as well as a
special construction of quantifier float in existential sentences.
14.2.1. Scalar quantifiers

count nouns.

c. sa bäziajal-arone several child-PL(K87,2:6)'several kids'
The expression sa Sumud 'some, several' consists of the interrogative pronoun Sumud 'how many?' (11.5.5.) plus the numeral 'one'. (The regular indefinite pronoun according to the pattern in 11.6.1. would be *sa Sumud
jat'ani, but this is not used.) Like the cardinal numerals, sa Sumud takes
singular nouns.

Some scalar quantifiers were originally partitive noun phrases (cf. 14.2.2.),
e.g. sa q'adar, originally 'a number, a quantity' (cf. bes q'adar 'sufficient
quantity', etc.). However, the fact that sa q'adar can be used with the substantivizing suffix -bur as in (666b) shows that it has been grammaticized to
a determiner-like quantifier.
14.2.2. Partitive phrases
Partitive phrases are NPs in the Absolutive case which express a certain
quantity of the modified head noun which they precede. This Lezgian construction corresponds to the English ""pseudopartitive"" construction. The
nouns used in partitive phrases typically denote containers (667), collections
(668), quantums (669), or abstract quantity nouns (670), and they are typically
preceded by a cardinal numeral. Syntactically, partitive phrases are much
like appositions (cf. 14.3.), but they are not treated as such here because their
meaning is quantificational and not at all like the meaning of real appositions.

9.3.2.1. Infinitive (or Imperfective converb). Its suffix is -z in strong verbs
and -iz in weak verbs. Since the Infinitive is also used in converbal function, it will sometimes be referred to as the Imperfective converb. There is
no formal difference associated with the two functions, except that the converb is sometimes reduplicated (cf. 21.2. for details). Unlike the Masdar, the
Infinitive cannot be inflected like a noun. In view of its likely origin in a
Dative case marker, this is not surprising.
9.3.2.2. Imperfective. Its suffix is -zwa in strong verbs and -zawa in weak
verbs. This form is a rather recent formation from the Imperfective converb
plus the locative copula awa:
gu-z 'giving'
kat-iz 'running'+ awa 'is'
+ awa 'is'>
>guzwa
kat-zawa'is giving',
'is running'In weak verbs, alternative forms are sometimes found where the a is
deleted instead of the i: kat-izwa (especially in older texts, e.g. Gad2iev
1954). The Imperfective suffix is also occasionally used on adjectives
(8.1.3.2.).
9.3.2.3. Continuative Imperfective. Its suffix is -zma in strong verbs and zama in weak verbs. This form has resulted from a combination of the
Imperfective converb plus the cont^ative copula ama (cf. 17.6.6.1.).
9.3.2.4. Future. Its suffix is -da both in strong and in weak verbs. The fact
that it has the two rather disparate meanings future and habitual (9.6.2.)
seems to have a diachronic explanation: Before the Imperfective forms
came into existence, it used to be a very general non-past form. After the
Imperfective took over first the progressive and later the general present
meanings, all that was left for this form was the future and habitual meanings. This hypothesis is corroborated by the fact that a few irregular stative
verbs still have the present-tense use of the form in -da (see 9.5.2.1.-4.,
8.1.3.1.).
9.3.2.5. Hortative. Its suffix is -n in strong verbs and -in in weak verbs. Note
that the Hortative of strong verbs is identical in form to the Periphrasis
form (9.3.5.) in Imperfective-stem forms.
9.3.2.6. Prohibitive. Its suffix is -mir both in strong verbs and in weak verbs.
This suffix -mir has been grammaticized from the old Prohibitive of awun
'do', mijir 'don't do' (the current form is iji-mir). This form, m-iji-r, consists
of an old Prohibitive prefix m-, the Imperfective stem -iji-, and the participial suffix -r (9.10.4.). Topuria (1959:118) cites similar archaic or dialectal
forms like me-qwa-r 'don't go', ma-gu-r 'don't give'.
Like the Imperative, the Prohibitive cannot be negated, and one could in
fact regard the Prohibitive simply as the negative form of the Imperative.
This is not done here because it would complicate the description of the
morphology considerably (the Imperative is derived from the Masdar stem,
while the Prohibitive is derived from the Imperfective stem).

9.3.2.7. Posterior converb. Its suffix is -daldi both in strong verbs and in
weak verbs. It can be thought of as derived from the Future, to which it is
also semantically related. The suffix -(da)ldi is in some way related to the
Superelative case suffix -Idi, which also sometimes means 'until' (7.2.2.15.).
9.3.2.8. Graduative converb. Its suffix is -rdawaj
in strong verbs and
-irdawaj in weak verbs. It seems to be originally the Adelative form of a
substantivized Imperfective participle in -r (9.10.4.), but the semantic development is obscure.
9.3.2.9. Immediate-Anterior converb -z(a)maz. The form is -zamaz in weak
verbs and -zmaz in strong verbs. Formally, it looks like a secondary converb
formed from the Continuative Imperfective, but this does not fit the
meaning very well. Am fizma means 'she is still going', but am
fizmaz
means 'as soon as she goes'.
9.3.3. Forms derived from the Aorist stem
9.3.3.1. Aorist. Its suffix is -na both for strong verbs and for weak verbs. The
affirmative Aorist is homophonous with the Aorist converb (9.3.3.4.).
9.3.3.2. Aorist participle. Its suffix is -aj for weak verbs (or rarely and archaically -ur) and -r/-j/-ji for strong verbs. The form -r is used after a high
thematic vowel (u, ü), and -j/-ji is used after a low thematic vowel (a, β).
The form -j is used after polysyllabic stems, -ji is used after monosyllabic
stems:
awu-na
t'ii-na
ata-na
qhwa-na
fe-naawu-r
t'ü-r
ata-j
qhwa-ji
fe-ji'(having) done'
'(having) eaten'
'having come'
'(having) drunk'
'having gone'Note that verbs like kitin 'write', qhfin
vowel by syncope count as disyllabic:
k£e-na
qhfe-nak£e-j
q^fe-j'go away' which have lost their stem
'(having) written'
'having gone away'9.3.3.3. Perfect and Continuative Perfect. Their suffixes are -nwa l-nma in
strong verbs and -nawa/-nama
in weak verbs. They are originally complex
forms built on the Aorist converb plus the copulas aw a and ama,
respectively, completely parallel to the Imperfective and the Continuative
Imperfective ( a t a n a 'having come' + awa 'is' > atanawa > atanwa
'has
come'). Since the Continuative forms are rarer, their degree of
grammaticization is apparently lower and non-syncopated forms like
ksanama
'is still asleep' (instead of standard ksanma)
are sometimes
heard.","[149, 150, 151]"

'two villages'. The forms with -d are used when the numeral stands alone,
i.e. in counting or when it is substantivized. An example of anaphoric substantivization of sad is given in (580):

Some Repetitive forms that are formed synthetically have a deviating lexicalized meaning, e.g. qhfin (Repetitive of fin 'go') means 'go away', not 'go

10.5. The-lamis-formAmong the many verbs ending in -miS that were borrowed from Turkic,
there is a group of verbs that also have the Turkic denominal suffix -la, e.g.

qaräilamiäun(cf. Turkic όοδ 'head')
(cf. qarSi 'opposite')'begin'
'meet'In some cases, the Turkic base word was borrowed into Lezgian along with
the derived verb. In this way, -lamiSun has become a productive suffix
deriving transitive verbs from nouns (mainly loanwords). The meaning
often corresponds to English -ize.

verbs awun 'do, make' and £un 'be, become'. Their meaning in the noun +
verb combinations is often so general that it reduces to the transitive/intransitive distinction. Verbal compounds are particularly common
with loanwords. A few examples are shown in (405)-(406).

ajaWhen the noun or adjective ends in a vowel, the reduced forms are generally not used. However, in a few frequent verbs reduced forms do occur. In
such cases a final -i is dropped and a j is inserted after a final -a to avoid a
hiatus: öimi awun ~ öimun 'warm up', aq^a awun ~ aq^ajun 'open, release, tell'.

full form and in a reduced form in the same text on the same page (e.g.
iStirak awuna and iMirakna, S88:164). One regularity that seems to hold is
that frequent verbs tend to be used in the reduced form (thus fikirun 'think',
k'walaxun 'work'), while rare verbs tend to be used in the full form (thus
inkar awun 'deny', haqh awun 'justify'). According to Gjul'magomedov
(1978:35-38) the full form is particularly characteristic of the poetic language.
Sometimes reduction of awun takes place even when awun is not used
as a function verb in a compound. Gjul'magomedov (1978:42) gives the following example, where meilisna is the reduced form of meilis
awuna.

21.5.4. Other causal clauses
In a very bookish style, the particle £i can be used in combination with a
demonstrative in constructions similar to degree consecutive constructions
(cf. 13.5.1.). This type of clause seems to have been calqued from Russian.

Purpose clauses can be either non-finite, marked by (a) the postposition
patal, (b) the Infinitive (Imperfective converb), or (c) the Purpose/Manner
converb, or they can be finite, marked by luhuz / lahana (converbs of luhun

21.6.1. The postposition patal 'in order to'
Patal 'in order to/for' is identical to the postposition patal 'for' (cf. 12.2.2.4.).
It takes a Masdar clause in the Absolutive case. ΡαίαΖ-clauses may have a
subject of their own, as in (1091), but their subject is most often controlled by
a salient argument in the superordinate clause, as in (1090).

"14.1. General properties of the noun phrase
A noun phrase (NP) consists of either (i) a pronoun (in the strict sense, i.e. a
pro-NP), or (ii) a noun head and optional preceding modifiers (quantifiers,
demonstratives, adjective phrases, Genitive NPs, relative clauses), or (iii) a
nominalized clause, i.e. either a substantivized relative clause (with a substantivized participle as its head) or a noun clause (with a Masdar or a substantivized participle as its head). Examples:
