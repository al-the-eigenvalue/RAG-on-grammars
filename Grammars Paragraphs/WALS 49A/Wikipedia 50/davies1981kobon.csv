An adjective clause may be derived
from a
clause or sentence by the same process
{see 1.1.2.3,.3-4).
A
simple or derived adjective phrase follows
4 ead
+
noun and
a derived adjective clause precedes the head
noun(132a)(132b)(132c)(132d)(seeAdjective clauses
(relative clauses)
precede the head noun
which is in turn optionally followed by a demonstrative pronoun
as an integral
part of the adjective clause constructionAll pronominal forms may function alone as nominals
or as
attributive
elements
within a noun phrase,
except for the
object forms which
function only as free forms.
Pronouns
functioning as possessive
adjectives
follow the noun and fall
into three subsets:
neutral;
emphatic/exclusive;
and emphatic/
benefactive.
The possessor
is often
further specified
either
by a noun or noun phrase preceding the head, or by a noun,
noun phrase,
numeral or quantifier
following
the possessive
adjective.
This is never the case with first and second
person singular,
and is not usnaily the case with first dua
and plural,
but it is often the case with third singular
an
second dual and plural,
and usually the case with third duaTE DT aert US ed[eet60
