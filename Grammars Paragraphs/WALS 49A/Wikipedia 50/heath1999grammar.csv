"Since ci links a subject NP with a postverbal NP, it resembles a transitive verb.
In many languages, an equational sentence with copula would be distinguished from a
transitive by case marking (copular 'X-Nominative be Y-Nominative' versus transitive
'X-Nominative hit Y-Accusative'), but KCh has no overt case marking for the
postverbal NPs in either case. If a third person pronoun functions as predicate NP after
ci, it takes the form 3Sg ga or 3P1 gi, just like direct object pronouns, as in (223), a
particularly common phrase.",[159]

DatIn (9), the noun slot is essentially obligatory except that an understood noun may
be omitted after a possessive (as in the pattern: 'Which house? Mine, or my
father's?'). Possessor, adjective, and numeral are optional. In the defmiteness slot, the
choices are Def di and zero. In the plurality slot, the choices are PI yo and zero
(usually interpreted as singular). The DF slot may be filled by a topic, emphatic, or
similar morpheme. In the final position, there are several nonzero postpositions such
as Dative se and Locative kuna. Subject and direct object NPs have zero case, and may
be said informally to be in the Nominative. Some adverbial modifiers like nee 'here'
can be analysed as zero case forms of (defective) nouns.
Personal pronouns can, of course, be used as NPs, but they do not fit neatly into
the schema (9). For example, the (third person) logophoric plural pronoun has a
discernible (but often phonologically altered) PI ending yo, as in (13). Any pronoun
can take a DF morpheme, a postposition, or both (14).

'to (for) me'The more complex sentence structures that we will briefly introduce here are topic
and focus constructions, relative clauses, and complement clauses (reported speech,
subjunctive, serial verbs).
Topic constituents (usually NPs) are usually preposed and set off from the
sentence proper by a pause. In this preposed position, they optionally take a Topic
morpheme. One common Topic morpheme is bine (also a noun 'heart'), often in
contrastive-topic function. A preposed topical NP often corresponds to a pronoun (in
any syntactic function or position) in the sentence proper, as in (15).

"3.7.8 Deletion of word-initial vowels (apheresis)
Except for French loans and a few grammatical morphemes such as personal pronouns,
words do not normally begin with vowels. The two chief exceptions are Arabic loans
beginning in a, and certain nouns and adjectives beginning in /'. Many of the Arabic
loans probably entered KCh from other African languages (cf. §3.10.8), which
probably accounts for the variation in their form.
Arabic has a definite prefix al-, which undergoes a special assimilation to a
following coronal consonant (affricate j is treated in Classical Arabic as noncoronal,
but in most modern Maghrebi dialects as coronal). As with Arabic loans into European
languages (algebra, algorithm), Arabic nouns borrowed into KCh often include the old
definite prefix, though the prefix is no longer segmentable and no longer marks
defmiteness. This gives rise to the KCh surface patterns in (43), where T is a coronal
consonant and K is a noncoronal (velar, labial) consonant:
(43)Four onset types of nouns borrowed from Arabic
a. alKV... , as in albacir 'miser';
b. a/V... after loss of glottal stop or pharyngeal, as in alaahidu 'promise';
c. IV... , as in (b), with further elision of the initial *a, as in ladab 'polite
person';
d. aTTV... , as in adduhaa 'mid-morning'.
The Arabic sources here are al-baxii!, al-Taahid(u) (or other form of the root
, al-'adab, and ad-duhaa.",[53]
"3.9.2 Stress, incorporation (tight compounding), and cliticization
Stress is nonphonemic, with neither lexical nor grammatical significance, in the
analysis and transcription used here. In a few cases, an unusual phonetic stress3.10 Historical phonological notes49placement may be a surface indicator of vowel length in a position (before a consonant
cluster) where duration is an unreliable surface cue; see §3.7.9.
As in many languages, multisyllabic words tend to have reduced phonetic stress
(intensity, pitch, vocalic duration, etc.) on final syllables, especially CV syllables.
Even stem-final CVV syllables in nonmonosyllabic words tend to be heard as
unstressed short-voweled phonetic [CV] when prepausal or at the end of syntactic
phrases, so the length of final vowels is best determined by adding a grammatical
formative, e.g. Def di in the case of nouns. The lack of intrinsic stress on final
syllables allows speakers to use final syllables to express higher-level intonational
patterns (e.g. rising pitch marking interrogation or a desire to keep the floor).
Many grammatical morphemes, though transcribed as separate words, are regularly
unstressed and tend to pattern as proclitics or enclitics to nouns, verbs, and other
lexical stems. We do not emphasize this issue here since the phonological
consequences are usually nonexistent or subtle. For that matter, there are no
completely reliable phonetic indices of affixation or incorporation (tight compounding,
§4.6), as opposed to word sequencing, and our decisions about which morpheme
sequences to recognize as single-word compounds and which to separate
transcriptionally are based largely on semantic lexicalization and morphosyntactic
patterning.
The best case for cliticization as a formal feature of the grammar involves
postverbal pronominal objects and pronominal PPs. These elements normally
immediately follow the verb, preceding other postverbal constituents that involve full
(noun-headed) NPs (§9.1.1). The dative forms of two pronouns, ISg and 2Sg, also
show special forms in this postverbal position, as opposed to the regular forms they
have in fronted (focalized, preverbal) position (§3.8.1-2).","[64, 65]"
"5.9 Adpositions and case-marking
5.9.1 Unmarked case versus adpositions
The distinction between subject and direct object is expressed by constituent order.
Subject NPs precede MAN morphemes and the verb, which is followed by direct
objects and PPs. When a direct object is fronted in the focalization construction it
precedes the subject NP and is normally followed by Foe morpheme na. Although
subject and direct-object NPs lack case markers, there is rarely any difficulty in
identifying these case functions. (135) is a simple transitive example.

'The man sees the woman.'[woy
[womandi]
Def]Certain personal pronouns (3Sg, 3P1) have distinct forms for subject and object
function, the subject variants also being used before postpositions (§4.1.1).
Topic NPs ending with Top bine ('as for'), which precede the sentence proper, are
also unmarked for case; see §5.8.2.
Many ""adverbs"" can be thought of as nouns or simplified NPs denoting times,
locations, and similar concepts. If so, they can be analysed as NPs unmarked for case
on the surface, though some kind of locative is implied ('tomorrow' = 'at tomorrow').
Most other grammatical relations are expressed by postpositions to be described in
the following sections, though in some cases the postposition can be omitted.",[119]
"5.11.1 Conjunction of personal pronouns
That the pattern X [nda Ύ] 'X and Y' is asymmetrical even when X (left conjunct) and
Υ (right conjunct) are of the same syntactic type is most clearly seen by studying the
forms they take when X and Υ are personal pronouns. There is a standardized ordering
of the pronoun categories along a (grammaticalized) topicality hierarchy, and certain
pronominal categories take different forms as left and as right conjuncts.
The ordering of categories normally follows the hierarchy in (157), as seen in
(158). Counterexamples with ordering inverted occasionally occur in direct elicitation,
probably reflecting interference from French cues, but are unidiomatic and do not occur
in texts. Simple 3Sg or 3P1 pronouns never occur as left conjuncts since this is an
""exposed"" syntactic position forcing replacement of (unmarked) 3Sg by 3SgF and of
3P1 by 3P1F (§8.4.2).

3SgOLogophoric pronouns fit somewhat variably into the hierarchy (157), reflecting the
fact that a (third person) logophoric pronoun in reported speech represents a first person
pronoun in the original speech event (Ί am coming' becoming reported-speech 'Hex
said he, (LogoSg) was coming'). See end of §10.1.2 for examples and discussion.
Some subdialects of KS express Ί, and hey' as 'we,y and hey' and so forth, the left
conjunct being pluralized to subsume the denotation of the two conjuncts. This1145 Nominal inflection and N P syntaxconstruction does not occur, to my knowledge, in KCh, and combinations like (158a)
with singular left conjunct are normal.
From (158c-d) we can see that the right conjuncts take the same form as directobject pronominals. This is most obvious with 3P1O gi ~ ji and 3SgO ga, but all other
pronominal right conjuncts are at least compatible with this morphological equation.
The left conjunct might then be taken to be associated with subject status. There is
some syntactic evidence for this, since expressions like 'hex and hisx mother' require
reflexivization of the possessor pronoun. However, (158d) shows that a 3Sg left
conjunct appears as 3SgF ijga rather than as ordinary 3SgS a. Left conjuncts are
therefore an ""exposed"" syntactic position in the sense of §3.8.8 and §8.4.2, unlike the
usual (proclitic) subject position.
The subject-object asymmetry supports a bracketing [X [nda Y]], in which the
right conjunct is the immediate complement of nda. However, this judgement depends
in part on our overall interpretation of the morphosyntactic status of object pronouns,
on which see §9.1.1.
In ""correct"" English we say he and I went, his and my (=our) house, and you saw
him and me. That is, case is assigned to the pronouns on the basis of their syntactic
function in the larger sentence, as in [you saw him] and [(you saw) me]. In colloquial
English, on the other hand, freezing of conjoined pronominal forms occurs as the old
accusative forms generalize, resulting in e.g. [him and me] went. However, this is not
usually extended to the possessive: W[him and me's] house.
In KCh, pronominal conjunctions are invariable in form and are therefore not
sensitive morphologically to surrounding syntax, even when functioning as possessors.
Consider (160).","[129, 130]"

Introduction1.1 Generalities about Songhay
Songhay is often described loosely as a ""language,"" but in fact it is a large complex of
varieties, some of which are quite clearly distinct languages. Languages of the
Songhay family are linguistically dominant in northeastern Mali along the Niger
River, and others of the family occupy much of the Republic of Niger (""Kaado"" and
""Zarma""). Additional varieties are spoken in Bonin, and perhaps still residually in the
Dori area of Burkina Faso (formerly Upper Volta). Some ""nomadic"" or ""northern""
Songhay languages, not yet well studied, are spoken by small beduin groups in far
northern Niger, with one offshoot each extending into Mali ('Tadaksahak"" near
Menaka) and in southwestern Algeria (""Korandje"" in the Tabelbala oasis). The major
work on the internal genetic classification of Songhay varieties is that of Nicola'i
(1981), who puts considerable emphasis on sound changes and phonological typology.
My work on Songhay has focused to date on the four main varieties spoken in
Mali. The following sets of designations are partially interchangeable. One set
consists of transcriptions of the native terms; the second is simply the name (in
English or French) of the respective major town; the third is the cardinal-direction
system developed by Nicola'i.

eastern Songhay (S. oriental)
central Songhay (S. central)For Gao, koroboro senn-i co-occurs with other variants such as koyra senn-i and
koyra senn-e.
The nouns ciini and senn-i ~ senn-i (with variant senn-e ~ senn-e) are noncognate,
though both mean 'speech, speaking, language', cf. verbs cii (<*ciin) and selaq seien. In the cases of Djenne and Hombori, both of which are (in effect) Songhay
enclaves rather than parts of extended Songhay-speaking regions, the first term of the
compound is simply the name of the town. Timbuktu and Gao, on the other hand, are
merely the largest cities in extended Songhay-speaking regions, and the terms for these
varieties are more general: koyra-ciini 'town language' and koroboro-senn-i
(contraction of koyra-boro senn-i 'town-person language') distinguish the sedentary
Songhays from the nomadic Arabs and Tuaregs. The Songhay are also sometimes
called 'river people' (Timbuktu isa-boro), but no related expression for their language
is in common use.
For the native sense of sonoy, see beginning of §1.2.
We will use the informal transcription ""Koyra Chiini"" to denote the unbroken
koyra ciini complex of dialects in the region along and near the Niger River beginning21 Introductionwith Timbuktu. This includes the towns of Dire"", Tonka, Goundam, and Niafunke
going upriver (west) from Timbuktu. There is a thinly populated northern extension in
Araouane, on the caravan route from Timbuktu to Taoudenni. There is a relatively
sharp linguistic break between Koyra Chiini and Koroboro Senni (the ""Gao"" variety)
just east of Timbuktu. Koroboro Senni is the traditional language even of Gourma
Rharous and Bamba, the first important towns on the Niger River going east from
Timbuktu.
Most of my Koyra Chiini data are from Timbuktu itself. I have a corpus of some
six hours of transcribed recordings, mostly dyadic (interviews, conversations, or
narratives with an interactive listener). I have supplemented this data base with elicited
material obtained chiefly in the final field sessions (1996-97).
I also have some transcribed recordings from Niafunke"" and Goundam, which can
serve as representatives of the larger complex of ""upriver"" dialects (""upriver"" from the
perspective of Timbuktu). I also spent about a week in this area in 1996 to clear up
some problems in the analysis of these tapes and to do some follow-up elicitation and
ethnobiological vocabulary elicitation and specimen collection. A summary of
observable differences between the upriver dialects and the Timbuktu dialect is given in
the short Appendix 1. In the much larger Appendix 2, I describe the distinctive and
geographically separated variety of Djenno, which I refer to as ""Djenne Chiini"" (for
jenne ciini, literally ""Djenn6 language""). Abbreviations for the Malian Songhay
languages and varieties used in this grammar are KCh (Koyra Chiini, the present
object of study), DjCh (Djenne Chiini), KS (Koroboro Senni of Gao, etc.), and HS
(Humburi Senni of Hombori). Names of other Songhay languages are not abbreviated.
The wider genetic affiliation of Songhay is controversial. It is one of the few
African languages for which Joseph Greenberg (1966) did not make a confident
assignment to a large genetic stock, though he suggested Nilo-Saharan as a possible
connection. Nicolai (1984, 1990) has suggested a possible Creole origin in which
Tamashek (Tuareg) played a major lexifying role, but this has not won wide
acceptance. It might be advisable to defer reconsideration of the wider affiliation of the
Songhay complex until we have better descriptions of the several varieties within the
complex and can thus do serious reconstruction of Proto-Songhay.","[4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18]"

These examples show various combinations of presence or absence of postposition
wane. We get wane after both possessors in (97a), after the rightmost only in (96),
after the leftmost only in (97b), and after neither in (97c).
5.2.3 Possessors as apparent heads of the higher NP
In the English sentence My dog ran away but John's is still here, the possessor John's
appears to function as head of the higher NP and denotes John's dog. Alternatively, we
could say that the head noun is expressed by zero (John's 0 is...).
The same pattern occurs in KCh. In this case, the postposition wane is
obligatory. In the ordinary definite case, wane is directly followed by Def di, a
combination which is irregularly realized as wan di (§3.8.4). Examples in (98), with
the position of the unexpressed head noun marked by 0.","[101, 102]"
"Chapter 5
Nominal inflection and NP syntax5.1 Overview
In the previous chapter we introduced the morphemic material of NPs and examined
processes of noun-stem formation. In the present chapter we focus on the larger NP
syntax and on the analysis of relevant grammatical categories.
The simplest NPs are personal pronouns (§4.A), which take no further marking for
definiteness or plurality. In this chapter, however, we are concerned chiefly with ""full
NPs"" headed by a lexical noun, or by another stem capable of functioning as NP head.
The latter set includes adjectives or numerals converted into NP heads by means of the
Absolute prefix a- or i- (§4.4.3, §4.5.1), demonstrative pronoun woo, and possessive
phrases with postposition wane. A ""full NP"" is any NP not consisting of a personal
pronoun.
The maximal structure of an NP (or PP), excluding relative clause modification, is
that shown in (92).
(92){
coreNP
} post-core elements
possessor - N - Adj - Num - Dem - Def - PI - kul - DF - PostpThe ""core"" of a full NP consists of the lexical information necessary to specify the
denoted referent. This core NP is syntactically equivalent to a personal pronoun. Either
the core of a full NP, or a personal pronoun, may be followed by any of the post-core
elements: kul 'all'; a DF (discourse-functional) morpheme such as Top[ic] or
Emph[atic] (also Only' or 'also'); or a postposition. The position of kul is more
variable than indicated in (92), and it can follow DF morphemes under some
conditions. If a postposition is present, the entire phrase is a PP (postpositional
phrase).
The lexical head is the noun in the second position of (92). It is preceded by a
possessor NP, which itself contains an NP. The head N may be followed by a
modifying adjective, a numeral, the demonstrative pronoun woo 'this, that', Def di, and
PI yo. All the positions except the noun are optional.
Even the noun may be omitted if there is another element present that is capable of
carrying the basic information (possessor, adjective, numeral, or demonstrative). When
a possessor NP, adjective, or numeral functions as head of the NP in the absence of N,
certain morphological restrictions and adjustments apply (§5.2.3, §5.3.1, §5.4.1).
A few examples of NPs headed by nouns or demonstrative woo are given in (93).
Post-core elements are included in the NP with universal quantifier (93d) and in the PPs
(93e-f), one of which (93f) has a DF morpheme before the postposition.","[98, 99]"
"4.3.2 Zero-derived nominals and minor nominalizations
Many stems are used both as nouns and verbs without overt derivational modification.
In such cases there is no morphological test for determining which function (if any) is
basic and which derived, though in individual cases we can make a judgement based on
meaning and frequency. An exhaustive analysis is beyond the scope of this grammar,
but a few examples, given in (71), will hint at their range.

The cases in (71a-b) involve stems ending in L In some of these cases the noun is
actually an old abstractive in suffix *-i (still productive in KS). This is clearly true of
gaaniand haawi (7la), where comparative evidence points to verbs *gaan 'dance' and
*haaw 'be ashamed', and to nominalizations *gaan-i 'dance' and *haaw-i 'shame';
KCh has generalized the old noun forms to both functions. There are a few other
apparent vestiges of the *-/ suffix. Related to duma 'sow (millet)', aside from
duma-rey 'seeds' mentioned in the preceding section there is another form dumi
'seeds', ciimi 'truth' (*oiim-i) and ciini 'language' (*ciin-i) are discussed in §3.10.7.
In (71b), there is no comparable direct evidence that the noun originally had the *-i
suffix and the nominal and verbal forms may simply involve the same stem.
The cases in (71c-d), a very small sampling of the many observed examples,
illustrate the difficulty of determining the direction of derivation (verbalization of noun,
or nominalization of verb). (71c) involves verbs of adjectival quality, and the nouns can
be taken as derived on semantic grounds. (7Id) involves more active verbs. If we take
the (7Id) verbs as basic, we can analyse some nouns as product-of-action nominals
('song', 'fold', perhaps 'bubbles'), Instrumentals ('key'), verbal nouns ('beginning'), or
characteristic patient ('kid'). In several cases, though, we could also take the nouns as
basic and analyse the verbs as expressing some more general action involving the
denoted entities, e.g. 'sing' = 'make a song', 'be bubbly' = 'make bubbles', 'lock' =
'shut with key', 'pamper' = 'treat like a kid'.
Compound verbs of the type [verb ka verb], linked by Infinitival ka, can have
zero-derived nominals: koy ka kaa 'go and come' (verb) or 'going and coming'
(noun). Derivatives, especially causatives, are easily nominalized: jur^ndi 'cause to run,
drive' (verb) or 'driving' (noun).
There are a handful of cases where a noun-verb pair of the same general type as in
(7 Id) involves a small phonological difference. These presumably reflect old
derivational mechanisms, no longer productive. Entirely irregular are fun 'pierce'
versus rune 'hole'; fiisi 'sweep' versus fisaa 'broom'; and hawru 'eat evening meal'
versus hawre 'evening meal (noun); eat evening meal (verb)'.","[81, 82]"
"The type (649a) has been verified in elicitation. However, such koon phrases are
best analysed as adverbial ""small clauses"" tightly bound to the preceding VP, since
negation and other inflectional categories of the main clause include the koon phrase in
their scope; see discussion of the same example as (397a) in §8.5.2. So there is a
reason why (649a) has a 3Refl pronoun while (648a-b) have simple 3Sg pronouns.
We now turn to relative clauses. Here we need to keep track of two potential
antecedents—the head NP (which can play any role in the matrix clause) and the
subject NP of the matrix clause. The two are sometimes one and the same ('the man,
[who, hit me] has come'), but need not be ('the man, saw the boyy [whoy was eating
the mango]').
The head NP is coindexed with some NP within the relative clause. However, this
coindexed NP usually appears as zero (we often represent it as a trace, reflecting
extraction in the form of the Rel morpheme ka ), rather than as a 3Refl (or other)
pronoun. Even when the corerefential NP is expressed in the form of a resumptive
pronoun, the pronominal category is nonreflexive 3Sg or 3P1 rather than a 3Refl form
(§8.3.2-3, §8.3.8). We disregard cases where the pronoun is 3Refl by virtue of
coindexation to a clause-mate antecedent, as in Ί saw the dog, [which, bit its, (own)
tail],' where 'its' is expressed in KCh by a 3ReflSg pronoun because of its
coindexation with the clause-mate subject (not because of coindexation with the head
NP of the relative clause).
So coindexation of a relative-clause NP with the head NP does not result in
reflexive binding. However, coindexation of a relative-clause NP with the matrixclause subject (if the latter is not also the head NP) does result in its expression as a
3Refl pronoun under most conditions. This is seen in (650). There are several textual
examples involving 3Refl pronouns functioning within the relative clause as subject
(650a-b) and direct object (650c). However, 3Refl marking within relative clauses,
with matrix-subject as antecedent, is not as rigorous as Logo marking in reported
speech. In particular, 3Refl marking seems to be avoided in left or right conjuncts,
whereupon we get instead a ""3F* pronoun as left conjunct (650d) or a simple third
person pronoun as right conjunct (650e). 3Refl marking is also disfavored in
complements to PPs (650f), though the informant accepted a 3Refl version ending in
ggu beene. In assessing the use of 3Refl pronouns in this syntactic context, it is
essential to weed out examples like (650g-h), where it can be argued that singular ggu
or plural ijgu-yo ~ tjgi-yo has logophoric function.",[353]
"4.1.4 Subject and Object forms of pronominals
The simplest type of NP is a bare personal pronoun. The basic forms are shown in
(58); variants and irregular allomorphs are commented on below.

On the optional reducation of 2SgS ni to n in some but not all morphosyntactic
positions, see §3.8.2. For irregular ISgS yc and 2SgS ma in certain combinations, see
§3.8.1-2. For numerous additional variants of rjgi-yoandrjgu-yo, see §3.8.8.
(58) shows distinct subject and object forms for the ISg, 3Sg, and 3P1. The other
pronouns have a single, invariant form (shown in a central S=O column between the
S-only and O-only columns). In the case of ISg, the orthographic distinction reflects
what is arguably a subphonemic positional variation in the pronunciation of the
diphthong nucleus (§3.3.1). The only real subject-object variation is therefore in the
""3"" category, where the object form (which directly follows the verb) is 3Sg ga or 3P1
gi (sometimes palatalized to ji, §3.6.4). Some examples of the ISg, 3Sg, and 3P1 are
given in (59); the syntactic order is subject + verb + object as in English.
(59)Examples of subject and object personal pronouns (with kar 'hit')

c. i kar ga

"4.1.1 Person and number categories
The morphologically distinct categories of personal pronouns are ISg, 1P1, 2Sg, 2P1,
3Sg, 3P1, 3SgF, 3P1F, Logo/3ReflSg, and Logo/3ReflPl. We sometimes use ""1,"" ""2"",
""3,"" ""3F,"" and ""Logo/3Refl"" (note the quotation marks) as cover terms for the
respective singular and plural categories. There are no gender or noun class distinctions;
""F* stands for ""Full"" (not ""Feminine""). An additional S or Ο at the end of a morpheme
label means ""subject"" or ""object."" Most pronouns have invariant forms, but the simple
3Sg and 3P1 forms have morphologically distinct object forms (3SgO, 3P1O), and we
make liberal use of the subject and object specifications in interlinear morpheme
glossing to make the syntax clearer.
ISg denotes speaker, and 2Sg denotes an individual addressee. All other singular
categories (3Sg, 3SgF, Logo/3ReflSg) exclude speaker and addressee. For the semantics
of plural pronouns, see the following section.
There is no specifically generic pronoun (Fr. on, German man), but 2Sg is
common in a generic (universal) human sense (§10.3.1).
For the forms of third person pronouns, see §3.8.8. The primary grammatical split
in this subsystem is between ""3"" and ""3F* on the one hand and the undifferentiated
""Logo/3Refl"" (logophoric and third person reflexive) on the other. To a large extent the
difference between ""3"" and ""3F* is automatically determined by syntactic position, ""3F'
occurring in more ""exposed"" (autonomous) positions and ""3"" occurring in more or less
cliticized positions. However, both are possible as postpositional complements and as
possessors (§8.4.2).
The Logo/3Refl pronouns express coindexation with a specific antecedent, either
the attributed source (speaker-thinker) of the proposition (as with logophorics), or a
syntactically specified NP (as with reflexives). It is possible for a Logo/3Refl pronoun
to have both functions simultaneously, as in the final pronoun of 'He, (3Sg) said [he,
(LogoSg) would hit himselfx (LogoSg & 3ReflSg),' which is coindexed both with the
quoted speaker and with the clause-mate subject. For details see §10.1.1-4 on
logophorics, and §10.2.1-4 on reflexives.
A few examples of third person (including ""3F,"" ""Logo,"" and ""3Refl"") pronouns
are in (53-56). English gender distinctions may be helpful in keeping references clear
but have no KCh counterpart.",[71]

Here we discuss cases where the same verb stem is used with variable valency. In
§4.3.2 we discussed similar cases where a stem may be used as a verb or noun without
derivational affixes. Subsequent sections will describe overt morphological derivations
which change valency.
In (204), S and Ο stand for the referents functioning as subject and direct object,
respectively, in the transitive case.

object of the transitive. In (204a), the intransitive events or states can occur in the
absence of an external agent, so we might argue that the transitive usage is the
semantic factitive-causative of the intransitive. On the other hand, in (204b) the
intransitive events or states strongly imply the presence of an (unexpressed) agent, so134 6 Verbal voice and verb derivation
we could argue that here the intransitive usage is a semantic passive based on the
transitive. In (204c), the intransitive omits the direct object of the transitive, so the
intransitive can be thought of as a kind of antipassive.
In (204d), the connection between 'come* and 'become' is less transparent, but
English come to be, and the use of motion verbs to mean 'become' in many other
languages (Fr. devenir, Spanish volverse), makes the connection more reasonable.
KCh kaa 'become' is formally a transitive verb, and the direct object can be a pronoun
like 3SgO ga, as in (205).","[149, 150]"
"4.4.3 Adjectives as NP heads with Absolute prefix iWhen the adjectival forms of §4.4.2 are used as apparent lexical heads of NPs (i.e.
when they follow an empty noun slot), they additionally require an Absolute prefix.
For modifying adjectives of the sort described in the preceding section, and for -nte
participles when treated as adjectives (rather than as nouns), the prefix is /'-. See §4.5.1
for the more complex system of numerals, several of which have a-.
The Absol prefix may be compared roughly to English one (as in α big one, two
big ones), which likewise allows an adjective to occur in a NP without a true noun.
Some examples of verbs of adjectival quality and their adjectival derivatives are given
in (80). We include one verb (futu 'be bad') which adds Participle ending -nte to form
the corresponding adjective (§4.3.4).

The Participle futu-nte in (80c) may also be treated as a noun and therefore can
occur without Absol i-, as in futu-nte di 'the bad one'.
The combination of 3Sg a or 3P1; (as possessor) with a following Absol adjective
beginning in a- is somewhat awkward because of the vowel sequence. Allowing
VV-Contraction (36) to apply would obliterate the distinction between 3Sg and 3P1,
turning both a_^ i-konn-o di 'his hot one' and £ i-konn-o di 'their hot one' into
[i:kon;odi]. In such cases, informants generally insisted on including the overt
Possessive postposition wane, hence a wane^ i-konn-o di and / wane^ i-konn-o di,
respectively. The same applies to numerals with Absol i- (§4.5.1).","[89, 90]"
"483 Phonology3SgF qga and Logo/3Refl qgu are normally indistinguishable as subject markers
before Impf o, since VV-Contraction (§3.7.1) applies, giving [rjgo:] in both cases. In
our practical transcription we maintain the underlying distinction, using the ligature to
indicate that contraction occurs: qga^ ο versus ggu^ o. In transcribing texts, we must
use judgement in deciding which transcription is valid in each instance, and readers
have the right to second-guess our judgements.
The morphosyntactic environments which allow unmarked ""3"" pronouns, and
those which require a shift to ""3F' (Full) pronouns, are given and exemplified in
§8.4.2. In general, unmarked ""3"" pronouns are used when they are not directly modified
(by a following Top, Emph, Foe, or other DF morpheme, by demonstrative woo, or
any adjective or quantifier), and when they function as arguments of a following
element or phrase (subject, postpositional complement, possessor). These can be
described informally as ""proclitic"" positions. The variant ""3"" pronouns, 3SgO ga and
3P1O gi ~ ji, are used in direct object function (immediately following a verb), and as
complements of the preposition nda 'with, and' (including right conjunct position in
""X and Y""). These can be thought of informally as ""enclitic"" positions. By contrast,
the ""exposed"" positions requiring the shift from ""3"" to ""3F' forms are those where the
pronoun is a phrasal head followed by a modifier or DF morpheme, or occurs in
isolation.
Typical examples of 3SgF gga are qga bine 'as for 3Sg' and the left conjunct in
ηga nda gi (""3SgF and 3ΡΓ). 3Sg a would be ungrammatical in these positions: #a
bine, #a nda gi. The sequence a bine is grammatical in a different sense 'his heart'.
In possessor function, ""3F' pronouns can be used instead of 3Sg a or 3P1 i. This
option is especially common when the following noun stem begins with a vowel,
which could trigger VV-Contraction and therefore cause the 3Sg or 3P1 morpheme to
disappear. Thus instead of tila^albarka 'its spiritual power' we normally get either ijga^
albarka with 3SgF pronoun, or a wane^ albarka with overt possessive postposition.
However, ""3F' pronouns are also sporadically used instead of 3Sg or 3P1 in possessor
function even before C-initial stems.","[63, 64]"
"10.1.2 Logophorics and deictic shifts in reported speech
We begin by noting that KCh has no analogue to the tense shifts that typically occur
in reported (past) speech in languages like English, where Ί want a mango' is reported
as 'she said she wanted a mango.' The basic KCh VP categories are imperfective and
(unmarked) perfective aspect, which require no adjustment due to the temporal
displacement of reporting past speech. Schematically, Ί Impf want [mango one]'
becomes [3Sg say, LogoSg Impf want [mango one]].
The most systematic indexical shift in reported speech is the replacement of
original first person pronouns by a type of pronoun known as ""logophoric,"" which is
used only for this purpose. In KCh, logophoric pronouns are identical in form to third
person reflexive (""3Refl"") pronouns. The basic Logo/3ReflSg pronoun is ijgu, with
plural counterpart ggu-yo or ggi-yo, the latter variant homophonous to the plural of
3SgF pronoun rjga (§5.8.2, §8.4.2). For analysis of the forms, with further variants,
see §3.8.8.
Logo/3ReflSg ijgu ~ ηυ is easy to distinguish from 3SgF rjga in most
environments. However, both combine with a following Impf o to give phonetic
[qgo:]. Our transcriptional system uses underlying representations plus a ligature to
indicate that contraction (§3.7.1) has occurred, hence we write qgu^ ο or qga^ ο
depending on which pronoun is involved. Readers working through published texts
presented with this ligature format should appreciate that each such transcription
represents an interpretation of the text fragment in question. On occasion a serious
analyst of KCh texts may disagree with the transcriber's interpretation, or conclude
that alternative readings are possible.
In interlinear glosses, I not only distinguish between ""3F* and ""Logo/3Refl""
forms, I also try to specify logophoric and reflexive functions of the latter. This
functional distinction is often straightforward, but in quite a few textual instances the
pronoun in question has both functions. For example, in 'shex said [she, would prepare
herselfj,' 'herself,' is both 3Refl (within its clause) and Logo (coindexed with the
quoted speaker). In ambiguous or doubly-marked cases we will use the noncommittal
""Logo/3Refl"" label in interlinears. It is also possible to have doubly logophoric
pronouns, as in 'she, said [shex would tell him [to hit her,]],' where the final pronoun32410 Anaphora, logophorics, and reported speechhas the same referent as antecedent at two higher levels, but we do not distinguish
double from single logophoricity in interlinears.
Examples of (nonreflexive) logophoric pronouns are in (619).

""They (=masons)x will consider you now that (=as though) you arc

The logophoric pronoun is used in any syntactic position whatever (e.g.
possessor, object of PP, subject of embedded relative). See the following section for
more on the syntax. Note also that a single quotative clause with har 'say' (or kaabu
'consider, reckon') can bind any number of logophoric pronouns. In fact, a single
chunk of reported speech may be a long second-hand story, in which case logophoric
pronouns can (in theory) be used throughout the narrative.
Logophoric pronouns are not used when the quoted speaker also happens to be the
current speaker or hearer. Instead, first or second person pronouns are used in the
quoted segment. With first person plural or singular speaker, we get examples like
(620a-b). There is no alternative construction.","[339, 340]"
"5.4 Numerals and other quantifiers91It is clear that kul here has scope over the already quantified inner NP. Compare
English every single side. Note that in (109b) the subject NP is treated syntactically as
singular, and therefore binds a singular (not plural) 3Refl pronoun later in the sentence.
In (109b), yer kuna (literally 'in us') is partitive in function (§5.4.10).
When kul 'all, every' is used as (apparent) NP head in the absence of a real noun,
it is expressed phonetically as singular [akul] or as plural [ikul]. There are two possible
ways to analyse (and transcribe) these forms. First, we could take the initial vowels as
special cases of the Absolute prefix, which is prefixed to adjectives and numerals when
they function as NP heads, the usual form being i- before ordinary adjectives and abefore numerals (§4.4.3, §4.5.1). We would then have to specify that, before kul, we
get a unique number differentiation of the Absol not found with adjectives or numerals.
The transcriptions would be a-kul and i-kul. This is the system we will actually use in
transcriptions. We will gloss a- as AbsolSg and i- as AbsolPl in these combinations,
instead of just as Absol as elsewhere. Examples in (110).
(110)a.a-kul
ο
baa-baa
AbsolSg-all
Impf
Rdp-break
'All of it will break' (= 'It will all break')
b. no-o
soo
i-kul
2SgS-Impf
pour
AbsolPl-all
'You(Sg) will pour (tea) for all of them.'se
DatThe alternative would be to take the forms as a kul and i kul, i.e., as ordinary 3Sg
a and 3P1 / pronouns, followed by kul. These would then be parallel to combinations
like yer kul 'we all', war kul 'you all', etc. Since 3Sg a and 3P1 / are elsewhere
replaced by 3SgF rjga and 3P1F rjgi-yo when followed by an attached particle or
modifier (e.g. rjga woo with a demonstrative), the fact that the quantified forms here
have a and i instead of ""3F* counterparts would force us to interpret a kul and / kul as
possessives ('his or her allness', 'their allness') to save the analysis. This would be
awkward but not beyond the pale. This possessive analysis would also explain why the
a and / do not take the forms 3SgO ga and 3P1O gi ~ ji when directly following a verb
in object function. Contrast 3SgO ga in (11 la) with a kul (not #ga kul) in (11 Ib).","[106, 107]"
"4.1.5 Pronominal forms as possessors and before postpositions
Pronouns used as possessors of a following head noun take the same form used in
subject function, allowing of course for regular phonological rules. Examples with
harme 'brother' (abbreviated ""B"") are ay harme di 'my B', yer harme di Our B', IM
h rme di 'your(Sg) B', war harme di 'your(Pl) B', a harme di 'his or her (3Sg) B',
ι harme di 'their (3P1) B', ηgu harme di 'his or her (Logo/3ReflSg) B', and ijgi-ya
harme di 'their (Logo/3ReflPl) B'. There is no general avoidance of or reluctance to
use simple 3Sg or 3P1 pronouns in possessive function in KCh. (KS, on the other
hand, does avoid 3Sg and 3P1 possessive pronouns.) However, ""3F' pronouns are
sometimes used instead of 3Sg and 3P1 in possessor function, as noted in §3.8.8.
Postpositions specify marked cases, generally spatial in nature. Personal pronouns
use the subject rather than object form (if overtly different), before a postposition. In
the dative only, the ISg and 2Sg have special irregular forms in the normal postverbal
(enclitic) position. In (62), last column, ""=S"" means ""same as subject form.""

1For analysis of the irregular ISg and 2Sg postverbal dative forms, see §3.8.1-2.
When a ISg or 2Sg dative form is fronted in focused position, we get the regular forms
ay se and ni se, respectively.
For the -yo- -ye alternations in the 3P1F and Logo/3ReflPl forms, see §3.8.6.
The unrounded -ye variant is also heard as -ya.
A few examples of postpositional phrases in their usual postverbal position are
given in (63), where the PP is bracketed even when (arguably) monomorphemic. Verbs
are noo 'give', har 'say', haijga 'follow', and too 'arrive'.",[75]
"The use of simple reflexive pronouns like 3Refl in direct-object function is
therefore basically limited to verbs where agent-patient merger is common, and indeed
where the two roles are not sharply distinguished in the event structure. Even within
this semantic type, reflexive transitive verbs are nowhere near as common as in
French, Spanish, and other European languages.",[349]
"(438)Here there are not one but two pronominal postverbal constituents, direct object
ga and Dat war se. We may consider this to be an enclitic string, attached as a whole
to the verb bar. In such cases, the direct object enclitic obligatorily precedes any
cliticized PP.
The cliticization analysis is useful in accounting for pronominal morphology as
well as constituent order. In (438) we have an instance of 3SgO ga, which differs in
form from a short 3Sg allomorph a. The longer ga is used in direct object function, in
which case it immediately follows the verb (for a 'give' construction with two such
object clitics, see the following section), ga is also the 3Sg form following the
preposition nda 'and, with'. The a variant is used in other functions including subject,
possessor of NP, and object of postposition. The 3P1 variants gi and i follow the same
pattern (§4.1.1). We could argue that the gV variants are required when the third person
pronominal is a) enclitic (to a verb or ndä), and b) is not bracketed with another
following morpheme (i.e., a postposition).
Alternatively, we could limit enclitic status to direct-object pronouns, in which
case condition (b) could be dispensed with since PPs would not be covered. But a good
case can be made for taking certain pronominal PPs as clitics. First, the ordering of
pronominal PPs before nonpronominal complements, as in (437), seems to be
obligatory with certain postpositions; the rare counterexamples in texts probably
reflect clause-internal repairs and are not confirmed in elicitation. Second, irregular
forms for the ISg and 2Sg dative combinations, used only in postverbal position, are
best analysed as special enclitic forms. Consider (439).

"4.5 Quantificational adjectives
4.5.1 Modifying and Absolute forms of simple numerals
Numeral stems are not used as verbs. They are commonly used as modifying adjectives,
following a head noun (and any descriptive adjectives). They may also be used as NP
heads, for example in counting, in which case some of them require an overt Absolute
prefix. As modifiers or as NP heads, they may be followed by Def di and
postpositions. The simple numerals are given in (81). For ordinals, see §4.3.4.

following section.
a- is the regular nonzero Absol prefix in true numerals, versus i- with ordinary
adjectives: a-woy 'ten'. Note that foo forms a-foo as numeral One', but i-foo as
interrogative 'which (one)?'. The only other alternation of Absolute a- and i- in
Timbuktu is a-kul 'all (of it)' versus i-kul 'all (of them)' (discussed in detail in
§5.4.3). In expressions like 'two or three Xs' for some noun X, the first numeral is
non-absolute since it is directly attached to the modified noun X, but the second
numeral has the Absol prefix. It seems best to bracket such phrases as in (82).

Absol-three]Several numerals have zero Absol prefix; alternatively, we could say that they do
not allow this prefix. The numerals from One' to 'ten' which have no overt Absol
prefix are '6, 7, 8, 9'. These happen to be the numerals with stem-initial i or y, so
there is a possible phonological characterization of this set, but the fact that these four
constitute a consecutive sequence in counting may also be significant. Other numerals
lacking an overt Absol prefix are 'hundred' and 'thousand', but in these cases the
explanation may be that they are syntactic nouns rather than adjective-like numerals.
Like ordinary nouns, 'hundred' and 'thousand' are themselves commonly quantified over
('five hundred', 'three thousand'). Finally, the suppletive ordinal lawal 'first' does not
take an overt Absol prefix: lawal di 'the first one'.
Very large numbers are expressed using French terms (million 'million', milliard
'billion, thousand million').
In §4.4.3 we noted that 3Sg a and 3P1 i as possessors are phonologically awkward
before ordinary adjectives beginning with Absol a-. The same awkwardness is observed
when these pronouns occur as possessors before numerals (e.g., ordinals) beginning
with Absol a -. Once again, the usual pattern is to include Poss wane, as in a wane^
a-hirjka-nte di 'her second one', or a ""3F' (Full third person) pronoun as possessor, as
mgga^a-hiqka-nte d/(same gloss). There is no difficulty with other pronouns, hence
ay a-hiijka-nte di 'my second one'.
boro 'person* is sometimes used as a kind of numeral classifier between a
quantified noun and a numeral. See §5.4.8 for some of the nuances when the quantified
element is a pronoun.","[90, 91]"
"1.3 Format of grammar
The present grammar of KCh is written in a fairly strict format to facilitate
comparison to the appendices and to my forthcoming parallel descriptions of other
Songhay languages. The numbering of chapters and sections thereof will be held
constant to the extent possible, although this means that in each grammar some
subsections are blank (e.g., ""tonology"" in the present grammar). In Appendix 1 on the
""upriver"" (Goundarm, Niafunke) varieties, and to a lesser extent in Appendix 2 on
DjCh, we disregard areas where their grammars do not differ significantly from that of
Timbuktu KCh (perhaps giving an example or two), reserving extended analysis for
areas where they differ from Timbuktu.
The format of the grammar is not revolutionary, and its general nature can be
gleaned from a pass through the table of contents. We begin with a brief overview
chapter (2), designed to give readers an idea what a simple Songhay sentence looks
like. Fortunately, the language is simple morphologically and readers should be able to
pick up its basic sentence structure quickly. A brief chapter on phonology (3) leads to
two chapters (4, 5) on nominal constructions, the first focusing on derivational
processes (also including information on personal and demonstrative pronouns), the
second describing NP inflection and phrasal syntax.
Verbs likewise get two chapters (6, 7), one mainly on voice categories expressed
by suffixation (or by zero), the other on mood-aspect-negation (MAN) inflection and
VP structure.
The next chapter (8) turns to ""information packaging"" issues such as focus, topic,
and relativization. These are all of great importance in Songhay discourse, and it turns
out that there are important differences among the Songhay varieties in the respective
forms and functions. This is followed by a chapter (9) on complex (interclausal)
syntax, in which various types of ""serial verb"" construction play important roles. The
final grammatical chapter (10) is on anaphora; the most significant topic here is the
use of logophoric and reflexive versus ordinary personal pronouns.
The last chapter (11) looks at selected lexical semantic matters, including the
lexical division of labor in expressing spatiotemporal concepts, and some
ethnosemantic issues such as kinship and emotion terminology.
A volume of Texts in Koyra Chiini (Songhay of Timbuktu) is in press with
Koppe Verlag, Cologne. It includes texts from Timbuktu, Niafunke (an ""upriver""
dialect), and Djenne. A set of three Songhay-English-French dictionaries is to be
published by rHarmattan, Paris. One of the three is KCh (Timbuktu to Niafunke), and
another is for DjCh (the third is KS of Gao).",[21]
"The minimal ""small clause"" generally consists of just a NP (often a pronoun)
plus koon, and it is not immediately obvious whether this is a subject-verb, nounadjective, or possessor-noun sequence. However, in a case like qga koon di (397c),
Def di excludes the subject-verb reading, and the use of 3SgF qga instead of simple
3Sg a seems to argue against the possessor-noun reading, leaving noun-adjective (here:
pronoun-adjective) as the preferred analysis; see §8.4.2 on the use of ""3F"" rather than
simple third person pronouns with following modifiers. We therefore tentatively
extrapolate from (397c) and suggest the same noun-adjective analysis for e.g. (397a-b).",[239]
"5.5 Demonstrative woo
Dem woo 'this, that' (§4.2.1) follows nouns (123a), as well as modifying adjectives
and numerals (123b), but precedes Def di and PI yo. It can also occur after personal
pronouns (123c), in which case our free translation is of the type Ί here'.",[113]
"Note that the ""appositional"" noun, like boro in (153), can be grammatically
singular when it has generic reference, as an alternative to the pattern in (152a-b) where
the noun has the same number marking as the preceding pronoun. The apparent
independence of number marking on the pronoun and noun in (153) is evidence in favor
of a possessive analysis (Our [typical] Timbuktu person').
A possessive analysis would be awkward with a singular pronoun denoting a
person. A phrase like 'ISg chief normally means 'my chief, and allowing it to also
have an appositional reading Ί, the chief would result in considerable confusion. In
fact, such juxtapositions do not normally allow appositional readings, unless the noun
is a personal name or other noun not ordinarily possessed, as in (154), where (as in
some other examples) the original name has been replaced by the linguist's name for
reasons of informant confidentiality. For Ί, the chief see the following section.

Another common device for expressing (English) appositions, whether or not one of
the elements is a pronoun, is a relative-clause construction of the type 'X which is Y'
as in (155).",[127]
"4.6.4 Nominals of essential nature (-ferey)
As a noun, ferey denotes the area immediately outside a house. As a compound final
(or derivational suffix), X-ferey is usually translatable as 'X-hood' or 'X-ness'. A

The first few examples involve ethnic groups (87a), occupations (87b),
socioeconomic statuses (87c), and biological and kinship statuses (87d). In these cases,
the ""X"" noun, used by itself, denotes a person of the relevant type ('Bozo person',
'mason', 'noble', man'), and -terey generalizes this to the respective larger class. Like
e.g. English nobility, the KCh compounds can denote either the idealized essential
nature of this class (skill in masonry, the proper exercise of noble class, the ideal
emotional attachments and sense of obligation in kinship relations), or the set of
members of the larger class ('His nobility impresses me' vs. 'The nobility oppose any

In (87e), we get more general abstractions that are not prescriptively connected
with prior statuses, alhaasidi 'self-centered person' denotes a person of the relevant
type, but alwaajib means Obligatory' and leselmeans 'authentic'.
In (87f) we have a couple of special cases where the compound can or must be used
as a verb. These are probably secondary verbalizations of older nominal compounds.

"10.2.2 Simple reflexive pronouns
Leaving aside the rather marked boro reflexives (preceding section), we have another
syntactic category of reflexives, the forms of which are given in (633).
(633)Forms of the simple reflexive pronouns
a. first and second person: same as the regular forms
b. third person: 3ReflSg qgu, 3ReflPl qgu-yo - qgi-yoThe forms of the 3Refl pronouns are completely identical to those of Logo
pronouns; for further variants see §3.8.8. For the many speakers who use i rather than
u vocalism in the Logo/3RefIPl qgi-yo, this is additionally homophonous to 3P1F.
The corresponding singulars are easily distinguished by vocalism (Logo/3ReflSg qgu
versus 3SgF rjga) unless contraction occurs with a following Impf o, in which case
what we transcribe as rjgu^ ο and nga^o, respectively, are merged as [ggo:].
We have noted before that the Logo/3Refl pronouns are sometimes
overdetermined, in that a given mention of a referent is locally reflexive (coindexed
with the subject NP) and is additionally coindexed with a quoted speaker (§10.1.2).
Consider the referential patterns (634a-c), where X has a constant reference, and their
KCh surface realizations schematized in (635a-c).
rjgu is 3ReflSg in (635a), and LogoSg in (635b). In (635c), the first ggu is
LogoSg, but the second is both LogoSg (coindexed with the attributed source of the
quotation) and 3ReflSg (coindexed with the subject of its own clause).",[347]
"188 8 Discourse-functional constructions and relativization
Head NPs may be personal pronouns ('you who ...') or nouns functioning as
surrogates for them ('you are a person who ...'). In such cases, the pronoun sometimes
recurs inside the relative clause ('you, who youx were sitting here'). Examples are
given in §8.3.1. When the head NP is generic boro 'someone', coreferential pronouns
inside the relative clause are often expressed as 2Sg pronouns in generic function; see
§10.3.1.
Some high-frequency ""light"" nouns tend to have shortened forms before Rel kaa
(§3.8.7).","[203, 204]"
"Chapter 4
Nouns, pronouns, and nominal derivation4.1 Personal pronouns
Personal pronouns can occupy the same kinds of syntactic positions as the lexical cores
of ""full"" NPs. That is, a personal pronoun corresponds syntactically to an NP structure
consisting maximally of a possessor, a head noun, an adjective, a numeral, a
demonstrative, Def di, and PI yo (§5.A).","[70, 71]"
"5.3 Adjectives875.3 Adjectives
5.3.1 Syntax of simple adjectives
We can define ""adjective"" syntactically as an element which may occur immediately
after a lexical noun (as head of NP), preceding a numeral if the latter is present. Most
of the common adjectives are derived from intransitive verbs of adjectival quality
(§4.4.1), for example jeen 'be aged', Adj[ective] form jeen-o. Adj suffix -o is very
common in such adjective forms but there is some lexical variation (§4.4.2).
Another class of syntactic adjectives are the -nte ordinals (derived from numerals)
and participles (derived from various types of verb, and rarely from nouns), § 4.3.4.
Examples are hirjka-nte 'second', albarka-nte 'powerful', and tey-nte 'wet'.
Examples of adjectives (including participles), with following numeral, are in
(100).

Def
'the four wet boubous (men's outer garments)'
If an adjective is present but the head noun is absent, the adjective can be said to
function as the head of the NP. In this case, an Absolute prefix is added; this is,
arguably, a dummy element which fills an otherwise vacant ""noun"" slot. The Absol
prefix is /- (§4.4.3), as in (101).

DefIn these respects, adjectives are similar morphologically and syntactically to
numerals, though numerals take a different Absol prefix, either a- or zero (§4.5.1). The
quantifying adjectives bobo 'much, many' and ciina 'few' are morphologically
indistinguishable from ordinary adjectives.","[102, 103]"
"945 Nominal inflection and NP syntax5.4.6 Generalized quantifiers ('many, much, few')
Quantificational adjectives are, formally, special cases of ordinary adjectives of the sort
discussed in §4.4.1-3. Specifically, as modifiers they follow the head noun (and any
descriptive adjectives), and when they function as heads of NPs they take an Absol
prefix. However, they differ from ordinary adjectives in some respects. The basic
generalized quantifiers are 'many, much' and 'little, few'. Each is used with both mass
and count nouns.
For 'many, much' the intransitive verb is bow 'be abundant, numerous'. The
modifying adjective corresponding to tow is bobo 'much, many'. On these forms, see
§3.10.1. The Absol form is i-bobo. Following the pattern observed with numerals,
even when added to countable nouns bobo is not directly followed by PI yo (116b), but
yo is added if there is an intervening Def di (116c).

as a modifying adjective, in this function it is usually replaced by keyna 'little, few,
small, young'. The Absol forms are i-ciinaand ΐ-keyna Unlike bobo, keyna in the
sense 'few (in number)' can be followed directly by PI yo. This usefully makes
possible a surface distinction between 'a small X' (X keyna) and 'a few Xs' (X keyna
yo. keyna is not in normal use as an intransitive verb. Examples in (117).

"In both the enumerating and possessive constructions, the pronoun in question
precedes the quantifier. When the quantifier is kul 'all', we get clearcut enumerating
expressions like war kul 'all of you(Pl)'. However, with numerals, the preferred965 Nominal inflection and NP syntaxsurface expression adds a head noun distinct from the pronoun. The usual noun used for
this purpose is boro 'person', as in (119).
(119)yer
boro
1P1

'we three'hinja
threeHere yer might be said to be in apposition to boro or perhaps to boro hinja. But
it is also possible to construe (119) syntactically as a possessive expression, glossable
as Our three persons' (cf. English the three of us). This is because possessors
(including pronominal possessors) precede the heads nouns they modify and only
optionally take Poss postposition wane (§4.1.5, §5.2.1).
What then about unambiguously possessive constructions like Our three'
(simplified from Our three dogs' or the like), with an unexpressed but understood head
noun? The expected maximal version of this is of the type [yer ( wane )] 0 i-hinja,
lit. '[1P1 (Poss)] 0 Absol-three,' with ""0"" representing the vacant head-noun slot. This
is quite grammatical and relevant examples occur in texts. However, again bow
'person' is optionally added as a dummy noun stem, sometimes even when the referent
in question is nonhuman, as in (120).

threeNote that possessive (120) is distinguishable from enumerating (119) only by the
presence of the optional Poss postposition, and the latter is more often omitted than
present. The syntactic distinction between enumerating and possessive types is
therefore shaky. For an English parallel note the phrasing of the three of us, which has
enumerating function but which is expressed in possessive form (of).","[111, 112]"
"10.2.4 Syntax of reflexive pronouns
In this section we complete the analysis of the syntactic configurations requiring
reflexive pronouns. We will focus on third person constructions, since only 3Refl is
overtly distinct from corresponding nonreflexive pronouns. For first and second
persons we can imagine covert [+reflexive] marking if we wish, but no empirical issue
is involved. We consider in turn simple clauses, then conjoined NPs beginning with
(646), then adverbially juxtaposed clauses beginning with (647), then relative clauses
beginning with (650), and finally subjunctive clauses beginning with (654).
The configuration accounting for most examples of reflexives is of the general
type (639).
(639)[s NPX - verb - ... NP, ...]
where the first NPX is the subject of the sentence SWe will refer to the subject NPX as the ""antecedent,"" and to the postverbal NPX as
the ""coindexed NP."" If the antecedent succeeds in ""binding"" the coindexed NP, we get
an anaphoric (3Refl) pronoun. We first consider simple cases where the coindexed NP
is not part of an embedded clause, and is not a possessor to another NP. This applies
to direct objects, objects of postpositions, and complements of prepositions like InstrComit nda 'with'.
In these syntactic functions, the coindexed NP is usually realized as a bomo
reflexive, in which case the anaphor is expressed as the 3Refl ""possessor"" of bomo
'head'. In §10.2.1, above, (630) shows instances following Instr-Comit nda (line 2 of
KCh text) and preceding Dat postposition se (line 6), while (631b-c) illustrate direct
objects, bomo is indeed normal in all of these syntactic functions.
The less common alternative is to use simple pronouns, including 3Refl for third
person. I have no textual or elicited examples of such pronouns following nda 'with,33410 Anaphora, logophorics, and reported speechand'. In direct object function, we noted in the preceding section that the construction
with simple reflexive pronoun such as 3Refl occurs only with a handful of verbs for
which subject-object coreference is very common. Likewise, pronouns such as 3Refl
are used instead of homo reflexives in certain PPs where coreference to the subject NP
is expectable rather than accidental. The chief example of this is doo 'at (the place of),
chez', which occurs very often in combinations like (640) with a motion or locational
verb and with a subject NP coreferential to the complement of the postposition.
(640)i
koy [qgi-ye
doo]
3P1S go
[3ReflPl at]
'Theyx went to their, home.' (= 'They went home.')One can say i koy [ggi-ye bomo doo] ""Theyx went to their, own home,' but
except in contrastive contexts this phrasing is awkward since it excessively highlights
the coreferentiality. A more idiomatic English equivalent (they went home) omits the
second pronoun entirely.
However, if the possessor of one of these postverbal NPs is coreferential to the
subject, this possessor is regularly expressed as a simple reflexive pronoun such as
3Refl. The basic pattern is therefore X [yp Verb ... [X's Y]] for some possessed NP Y.
This applies to the bomo reflexives themselves, since they are formally possessed NPs
of the type 'X's head'. When a bomo reflexive has a third person antecedent, it takes
the form gu bomo ('3ReflSg head'), or its plural rjgi-ye bomo ('3ReflPl head'), an
example of the latter being (63 Ib) in §10.2.1. This is just a special case of a more
general pattern by which simple reflexive pronouns are strongly preferred to the more
highlighted bomo reflexives in possessor function, whether or not the Poss
postposition wane is present. Further examples are given in (641), where the
possessor is attached to a direct object (641a), a postposition (641b-c), or the
complement of preposition nda (64Id).

"190 8 Discourse-functional constructions and relativization
I doubt that a competent syntactician would use (324a-b) to demonstrate that the
fluently spoken counterparts (e.g. nda gaabi bisa gaabi) have underlying third person
pronouns following the subject NPs (#//nda gaabi a bisa gaabi/Γ). Similarly, it
should not be rashly concluded from (323) that subject relatives require subject
pronouns following Rel kaa.
When the head NP is a first or second person pronoun (Ί who ...', 'you who ...'),
or a surrogate for such a pronoun (Ί am are a person who ...'), the coreferential
arguments within the relative clause may be expressed by the same pronominal
category as the head (325a), or may follow the apparently subjectless construction
described above (325b-c).

'you who know farming'Again the type (325b-c) without overt subject pronoun appears to be normal. The
type in (325a) seems to be favored by a hesitation (indicated by the comma), and did
not occur in elicitation.
When the relativized noun is itself focalized within the Rel clause, it appears in
the form of a ""3F"" pronoun such as 3SgF qga; see (432) in §8.6.5. However, one can
again suspect that a restart has occurred.
A further argument against underlying representations with resumptive third
person subject pronouns is the grammaticality of kaa nono 'which it is', see (467a)
in §9.3.3. This is because the identificational quasi-verb ποπό does not allow surface
expression of the implied ""subject"" referent, and hence disallows e.g. #a nono 'it is'
or an imperfective variant #a-a nono.
The data seem to point to two distinct analyses for subject relatives. One the one
hand, there are occasional examples where kaa is clearly followed by an overt subject
pronominal, suggesting that kaa is a nonpronominal relativizer. The relevant
examples include (323a-b) and (325a). However, these and other similar examples
arguably involve mid-stream restarts, resulting in main-clause instead of embedded
structures for the ""relative"" clause. In the great majority of smoothly uttered examples,
textual or elicited, kaa in subject relatives is followed by no audible pronominal
subject marker, and in the case of nono 'it-is' no such pronominal subject is possible
underlyingly. Although a surface [ka:] is in many cases phonologically compatible
with a contracted multi-morphemic underlying string including 3SgS a, e.g. kaa^ a or
imperfective kaa^ a-a, absence of an anticipated parallel pronunciation [ki:] in cases
where the (resumptive) subject pronoun should be 3P1 i is a serious blow to such an
analysis. So the bulk of the evidence favors the view that kaa is a relative pronoun
extracted out of subject position, leaving (at most) a phonologically null trace in the8.3 Relative clause constructions191original subject position. Though this is our preferred analysis, we will not use trace
notation tx in transcriptions except where it is specifically relevant.","[205, 206, 207]"
"5.11 Instrumental, comitative, and conjoined NPs
nda is very common as a clause-initial 'if subordinator in the antecedent clause of a
conditional (§9.5.1). However, in the present chapter we are concerned with the syntax
and semantics of the sentence-internal phrase type nda NP. In the following sections
we interpret ""NP"" broadly to include pronouns and NP-like adverbials, except when (as
in §5.11.2) we speak specifically of ""full NPs"" (i.e., NPs headed by a noun stem).
In the conjunction X nda Y, where X and Υ are NPs, the morpheme nda appears
at first glance to be an operator which handles its left and right conjuncts
symmetrically, producing a phrase of the same syntactic type as the conjuncts. In the
following two sections we will question the apparent symmetry of nda.
The phrase type nda NP with a single overt argument NP is also common. It is
the basic instrumental phrase, and can also be used as a comitative phrase. It usually
functions semantically as part of a VP (see §5.11.3).
As an 'and' conjunction, nda is restricted to conjoining syntactic NPs (including
pronouns) and NP-like adverbials. To a limited extent, it can also conjoin
postpositional phrases involving postpositions with noun-like character, but it does
not seem to work with the most highly grammaticalized postpositions and cannot
conjoin prepositional phrases (with Instr-Comit nda or with bilaa 'without', §5.11.6).
Furthermore, nda cannot be used as an 'and' conjunction linking two verbs, inflected
VPs, or clauses. The closest functional equivalent to ""conjunction"" in such cases is the
addition of an infinitival VP beginning in ka (§9.7.1, §6.3.2) to a preceding VP. When
nda is clause-initial, it functions not as an 'and' conjunction, rather as an 'if
conjunction in conditional antecedent clauses (§9.5.1).
An apparent counterexample to the claim that nda 'and' is not used to conjoin
clauses is (156).",[128]
"5.4 Numerals and other quantifiers895.4.2 Existential quantification
Existential quantifification is generally associated with the initial introduction of a
referent into a discourse. This may be accomplished either by an overt predication of
existence or location ('There was a dog'), or by using an indefinite NP in a larger
sentence (Ά dog was sitting on the lawn,' or Ί saw a dog on the lawn'). For
predications of existence, see §7.1.2-3.
Within a NP, KCh has no special form specifically for existential quantification,
corresponding to the English indefinite article (a dog), the bare plural (dogs) for count
nouns, the bare singular for mass nouns (water), or existential some (some dogs, some
water).
The numeral foo One' can sometimes be translated as an English singular
indefinite article, viz., when a new singular discourse referent is introduced with no
special focus on its number. Therefore the NP boro foo can be rendered as either One
person' or 'a person'. However, when a new referent is introduced, the foo is merely
optional, and it always seems to have more of its numerical value than does English
a(n). Moreover, foo cannot normally be used with a mass noun. See the examples in
(105).

Some examples of reduplication and parallelism discussed in §5.4.4 also have
existential implications, though no such construction is purely existential.
5.4.3 Universal quantification (kul 'all')
The only serious candidate for universal quantifier ('all, every') is kul (<Ar. kull 'all').
However, this morpheme has a considerably wider syntactic and semantic range than
does an ordinary universal quantifier. For the important use of kul in marking the right
boundary of a conditional antecedent or similar background clause, see §9.5.10.","[104, 105]"
"6.3 Compounds
6.3.1 Noun-verb compounds
Noun-verb compounds are rare, but they are easy to spot on grounds of word order (NV) and semantic skewing. The examples I know of are in (214). The compounds

There are many other combinations which have some resemblance to such N-V
compounds as (214). These are cases where the second stem is a verb, which is
followed by an Adj or (nominalizing) Abstr ending. The sequence N-V-Adj can
theoretically be bracketed either as [N-V]-Adj, with a N-V compound feeding into
adjectivization, or as N-[V-Adj], with a noun stem added as compounding initial to an
already adjectivized verb. Likewise for the sequence N-V-Abstr. In the cases known to
me, the inner N-V compound is not independently attested, and in view of the
productivity of N-N (and ""loose"" NP-N) compounds I am strongly inclined to favor the
N-[V-Adj] (and N-[V-Abstr]]) bracketings. Examples in (215-16). Zero-derived

6.3.2 Verb-verb compounds
It is very easy to combine VPs, by putting the second one in infinitival VP form
(beginning with Inf ka); see §9.7.1. This can be used to combine two VPs, both of
reasonable internal complexity. It can also be used to combine a specialized serial verb
with an internally complex second VP (§9.7.2).
The limiting case is a tightly-knit combination of two verb stems linked by ka
with no further frills, or with following postverbal material (direct object, PPs) that140 6 Verbal voice and verb derivation
appears to be attached to the verb-combination as a whole rather than just to the
second verb. In such combinations, which we refer to as verb-verb compounds, the
order of elements is usually fixed, and the compound as a whole can be nominalized or
form other verbal derivatives.
A common example is sar ka julli 'do somersaults', with sar 'jump' and a
second verb that is not attested outside of this compound. Other examples generally
involve paired actions that commonly occur together in some activity (cf. English cut
and run). That the system is potentially productive is shown by (218).

additionally have an Abstractive derivative in -ey, as do other types of verbs (§4.3.1).
The phonological relationship between the simple verb of adjectival quality, and its
form preceding -o and -ey, may involve minor, lexically specific irregularities. In only
two cases (42), a CVCVC verb stem with identical vowels undergoes syncope to

'bothersome'Participles function as nouns or modifying adjectives. (KCh does not use
participial clauses in DjCh fashion for resultative backgrounded clauses in narrative.)
Participles can be derived from numerals, from verbs of adjectival quality, from motion
and other action verbs, and in a few cases apparently from nouns.
The ordinal type in (76a) is productive and applies to all basic numerals. The
Absolute prefix a- is used in the same way in the cardinals and ordinals for those
numerals which take this prefix. An example of an ordinal based on a complex numeral
phrase is (a-)woy^cindi-hiijka-nte 'twelfth', the -nie taking the entire phrase in its
semantic scope, lawal 'first' (<Arabic) is suppletive, cf. (a-)foo One'. However, we do
get ordinal -/bo-niein complex numerals ending in One', as in a-woyjcindi-foo-nte
'eleventh' (Absol-ten-remainder-one-Ordinal).
(76b) shows that -nie can produce adjectives from nouns. This pattern is relatively
rare and lexically restricted. Further lexicographic study might suggest that some of
these are really deverbal (like the following sets), but of the four in (76b) only dowla
is even attested in my data as a verb, and even this stem is normally a noun.
(76c-d) show -nie participles forming adjectives from intransitive verbs of
adjectival (i.e., involuntary and enduring) quality. Other verbs of adjectival quality form
adjectives by zero affixation (adjective = verb) or by suffixation of -o (§4.4.2). The
choice between -nie, zero, and -o is partly lexical, but there are strong hints of
phonological factors at work. The stem shape CVVC predominates in the set of stems
taking -o, for example, but no stem of this shape takes -nie and only one (beer 'big')4.4 Morphology of adjectives71takes zero. On the other hand, a final diphthong, a final o in the verb itself, or a
lexicalized CVCV-CVCV reduplication favors -nte over -o.
The examples in (76e-f) mostly involve action verbs. Here the -nie participle is
generally an adjective (occasionally a verbal noun) denoting a state resulting from the
action. Semantically, the entity described by the adjectival cases is generally a patient
or theme. However, in the case of totro-nte 'bothersome, annoying, irritating' in (76g),
the participle appears to denote the agent (botherer) rather than patient (botheree).
As noted above, ordinals in -nte take Absolute prefix a- under the same conditions
as do cardinals. Other participles in -nte can take Absol i- when the preceding noun slot
is vacant, as in i-futu-nte di 'the nasty one' (§4.4.3). This indicates that participles can
be treated as adjectives. However, certain participles can alternatively be treated as noun
stems and so dispense with ;-, as in ruf u-nie di (same meaning).","[84, 85, 86, 87]"
"Each of (6-8) begins with a subject NP, which in (7-8) is a personal pronoun. The
MAN position is occupied by Impf o in (6), by zero in (7), and by Neg na in (8).
Except with equational and locational quasi-verbs, a zero MAN position is interpreted
as perfective positive, which is extremely common in past tense narrative. The verb
stem, here guna 'see', has no inflectional affixes for either pronominal agreement or
MAN categories. The direct object NP follows the verb (though not always
immediately), whether it is a pronoun as in (7) or a full NP as in (6,8). Further
constituents such as adverbial modifiers generally follow the direct object NP, as with
doodi 'there' in (6-7) and the Locative PP in (8). However, when a verb is followed by
two or more complements (NPs and PPs), their linear ordering reflects morphological
and discourse considerations as well as pure syntax.
The maximal internal structure of a NP or PP is schematized in (9).
(9)possessor - noun - adjective - numeral - demonstrative - Definite Plural - DF[discourse-function] - postposition
Examples of this structure are (10-12).",[27]
"138 6 Verbal voice and verb derivation
There are similar examples involving koy-nda, yee-nda, gey-nda, sawa-nda, and
tilasu-nda. For kubey-nda I have no example of the type seen in (212), since with
object separated from verb by an intervening dative, informants preferred to use the
synonymous underived kubey.
The fusion of -nda with the verb is strong in the case of the motion verbs in
(211 a). Note that in cases like 'S brings O', both subject and object are in most cases
jointly in motion. The apparent historical shift from 'S came [with O]' to 'S brought
O' is therefore straightforward and is known from many languages. The remaining
examples, lumped together in (2lib), are fairly diverse in type. Aside from the
smallish number of verbs affected, we notice considerable semantic divergence. In the
case of hima, the simple stem is a serial verb used in the Ought to' construction,
which has little connection to 'resemble'. Note that tilasu-nda has a different logical
relation to the corresponding simple stem than do the other examples.
When a causative is made from VERB-nda Y, we get VERB-Caus X [nda Y],
where nda 'with' is liberated from the verb and forms an independent constituent with
its (comitative) complement NP, generally not immediately adjacent to the causative
verb. Compare kubey-nda 'encounter' in (21 Ib) with causative kuboy-ndi ... nda
'cause to meet' in (213); cf. beginning of §5.11.3, above, (kubey and kuboy are
variants of the same stem.) The complement of nda has been extracted by
relativization in (213a), but this is irrelevant to the point at hand.

"61 Introductionl .4 Transcriptional conventions
KCh is quite simple morphologically and there are few productive phonological rules
disguising underlying (lexical) phonological representations. Double slashes // ... //
enclose underlying representations (not italicized). In the grammar text, brackets [ ... ]
enclose phonetic representations. The ordinary phonemic transcription is italicized
without slashes or brackets. We use the hyphen ""-"" as a morpheme boundary in a fairly
restricted set of cases where it seems justified. Examples are verb stems containing a
derivational suffix (Fact-Caus or Mediop -ndi), such as dira-ndi 'cause to walk'.
It has been difficult to decide whether to use hyphens in noun-noun compounds,
noun-adjective combinations, and similar close-knit stem sequences showing various
degrees of lexicalization. There is no consistent phonological test for lexicalization of
such combinations, and other criteria (frequency, semantic specialization) are gradient
rather than categorical. In general, I use hyphens in compounds sparingly (when the
combination seems fairly clearly lexicalized), and in combinations involving highfrequency finals such as -ije 'child' and -fiaa 'mother'. However, readers should not put
too much stock in these transcriptional decisions.
My most idiosyncratic transcriptional decision is to use the subscripted ligature
""^"" to indicate assimilations across word or morpheme boundaries. This enables us to
show the basic forms of the morphemes in question, maintaining the transparency of
the morpheme structure, while at the same time at least hinting at the surface
pronunciation.
In the case of nasal consonants, a ligature indicates point-of-articulation
assimilation to a following segment, generally n —> [η] before velar stop. The
expected parallel shifty—> [n] before alveolar consonant is moot in Timbuktu KCh,
where lexical stem-final η is normally absent, but occurs in upriver KCh dialects
which allow stem-final η.

A ligature between two vowels indicates contraction to a single surface long
vowel with the quality features of the second input vowel; this is especially common
in sentences containing Impf preverbal morpheme ο preceded by a subject NP or1.4 Transcriptional conventions7pronoun. Contraction may also occur in combinations involving a verb followed by
ISg object marker ey, or a verb followed by a postpositional phrase beginning with
any V-initial pronoun. A few examples are given in (3), below; see §3.7 for a full
discussion and more examples.

[qgo:]
Logo3ReflSg + Impf
[rjgo:]
SFoc + Impf (or: 3SgF + Impf)Note that this transcription usefully distinguishes ijgu^ ο from rjga^ o, which have
identical surface pronunciations.
In the underlying combinations 3Sg Impf a^ ο and 3P1 Impf ^ o, we again get a
long vowel but this time the quality of the first vowel prevails, so the outputs (in
Timbuktu) are [a:] and [i:], respectively. Note that the regular rule would merge them
as #[o:] with unfortunate consequences. I therefore transcribe them a-a and i-i rather
than as underlying forms with ligatures. I also choose to use no-o rather than ni^ o for
the high-frequency 2Sg Impf combination. In general, my transcription is designed to
be user-friendly rather than to be strictly consistent.
One important case of the assimilation //yj// to jj is intramorphemic, namely, the
form of the noun ije 'child' after a vowel-final morpheme, especially in compounds:
//tira-ije// —> tira-jye 'pupil in Koranic school' (lit., 'talisman-child'). Rather than try
to make the morphemic composition transparent by showing a morpheme-internal
ligature, i.e. as tira-ije, I prefer to just write tira-jjeand put cross-references between
-jje and ije in the dictionary. The form -jje is quite frequent and readers will soon
become familiar with it.
There are also a number of cases where an underlying segment is deleted. For
example, 2Sg ni optionally contracts to n in certain positions (before a verb or a
postposition), and a number of minor consonantal deletions occur in verbal derivatives
with Fact-Caus or Mediop suffix -ndi: dinrndi (pronounced [dindi]) 'be taken (Mediop)'
or 'set afire' (Caus); underlying //kam-ndi// — > kam-di 'cause to fall'. Where the
deletion involves one of two identical consonants, as in 'be taken', I use the ligature
notation, though the dictionary has pointers (e.g. ""din-di"" See din^ndi). Where the
deletion involves nonidentical consonants, as in 'cause to fall', my transcription
reflects the deletion.
I have chosen to make selective use of square brackets [ ... ] in transcriptions to
indicate phrase or clause boundaries that might otherwise be unclear to readers. My use
of these boundary devices is designed mainly to help readers navigate through difficult
(but interesting) textual passages, with an emphasis on clarifying scope relationships
and other semantic as well as syntactic structures. For instance, one example from
Chapter 2 is presented as (4).","[21, 22, 23]"
"4.5.2 Compound numerals
Multiples of ten, from 'forty' to 'ninety', are constructed by compounding woy 'ten'
and a following numeral from 'four' to 'nine', with irregular phonological contractions
in the cases of '50', '60', and '70' to shorten final long vowels or to reduce bulky
consonant clusters: woy-taaci 'forty', woy-gu 'fifty', woy-du 'sixty', woy-ye
'seventy', woy-yaaha 'eighty', and woy-yaaga 'ninety'. Note in particular that gnu76 4 Nouns, pronouns, and nominal derivation
'five' loses its vowel length in woy-gu 'fifty', even in combinations like woy-gu di
'the fifty' where vowel length (if present) would be clearly audible.
These combinations could be analysed as 'four tens', etc. Although woy in the
sense 'ten' takes the Absol prefix (a-woy) where syntactically appropriate, the larger
multiples such as woy-taaci do not, and so are used without modification as heads of
NPs (and in counting).
Regular (unconnected) numeral phrases are used for hundreds (jo g ) and thousands
(jember): jorjgu hinja 'three hundred', jember guu 'five thousand'. One hundred' is
usually just jorjgu, while One thousand' is always jember foo including the numeral
One'. The French loan milyo 'million' has the same pattern: milyö foo One million'.
Compound numerals from 'eleven' to 'nineteen' are expressed as woy^cindi-... 'tenremainder-...' plus the uncontracted single-digit numeral, e.g., woy^cindi-guu 'fifteen'
and woy^cindi-iiye'seventeen'. Note that here guu 'five' preserves its long vowel. In
Timbuktu, the y of woy- regularly assimilates to the following palatoalveolar to give
[tif] (§3.6.3). The Absol prefix is used where appropriate in such combinations:
a-woy^cindi-guu 'fifteen (of them)'.
The same kind of compound with cindi 'remain' as linker is used for compound
numerals involving a multiple of ten plus a single digit, e.g., waraqka-cindi-yaaha
'twenty-eight' and
[woy-gu]-oindi-hirjka'fifty-tv/o\
Combinations involving two or more parts (thousands, hundreds, 1-99) stitch the
parts together with nda 'and, with' (§5.11). For example, '1,500 riyals' is expressed as
(83).
(83)allaara
riyal[[jember
[[thousandfoo]
one]nda
and[jorjgu
[hundredguu]]
five]]4.5.3 Other quantificational modifiers
For predications of existence (There is an X'), see §7.2. Within a NP, there is no pure
existential quantifier, but foo One' sometimes approaches it. For this and other
relevant constructions see §5.4.2.
The morpheme kul is often used as a kind of universal quantifier. It occurs in a
wide range of syntactic positions, both within NPs and clause-finally. See §5.4.3 for
its role as quantifier within NPs, and §9.5.10 for its clause-final uses.
Numerals may be reduplicated, as in a-foo-foo One by one, one each' and
a-higka-hirjka 'two by two, two each'. As heads of NP, as in these two examples, the
Absol prefix is used once and is not repeated before the repeat occurrence of the
numeral. These reduplicated numerals generally have distributive function (§5.4.4).
When a set is divided into two or more complementary subsets of one or more
individuals, to which different predications are applied ('Some stayed here, the others
left'), KCh generally uses symmetrical segments of the general type 'some ones ... ,
some ones ...' or 'the one ... , the one ..."" See §5.4.5 for details.
The primary generalized quantifiers are ciina 'few, infrequent, rare' and bobo
'many, much' (corresponding to intransitive verbs oiina and bow). Formally, these are
ordinary adjectives like those treated in §4.4. For details on usage, see §5.4.6.","[91, 92]"
"11.3 Perception
Perception predicates, as in English, have a subject NP representing the perceiver
and a direct object representing the perceived object or its sensory emanation. The
primary verbs, all transitive, are given in (710). mom normally means 'hear, listen,
understand (words, language)', but has the sense 'smell' in connection with an object
like hew 'wind, air, odor'. The verb maata is a more abstract stem meaning 'become
aware of, through unspecified sensory channels.",[382]
"10.3 Generic and indefinite reference
10.3.1 boro 'person* and 2Sg pronouns
The primary term used to introduce an indefinite or generic human discourse referent
('someone, anyone') is the bare indefinite noun boro '(a) person*. The initial
introduction of such a discourse referent may be in any syntactic position. Among the
common sites for an initial introduction are conditional antecedents ('if someone
comes, ..."" or 'if you see someone, ...'), and the head of a relative clause ('someone
who ...'). The latter is expressed as bor kaa ... (§3.8.7).
Subsequent mentions of the indefinite referent often take the form of 2Sg
pronouns. Generic you is familiar enough from English; what is distinct about KCh is
that the introduction is often in the form boro 'a person', with 2Sg then used as a kind
of anaphoric pronoun—whether in the same clause or in an embedded or following
clause. Some examples combining boro and 2Sg pronoun in generic function are in346 10 Anaphora, logophorics, and reported speech
(668); the ""free"" translations retain the original pronominal categories, so the English
is awkward.

'So, [someone (=you)]x can go, (with the result that) your, whole
day's output may turn out to be (merely) debris?'
ws_*JThis pattern is very common and may be considered the normal treatment of
generic referents in simple passages. However, it is also possible for boro in generic
function to be repeated in subsequent mentions as boro or as a 3Sg pronoun. This
pattern can be applied when for some reason it is inappropriate to offer the addressee an
opportunity to symbolically enter the role of the generic personnage in question, or
(more cogently) in passages where the 2Sg category has been pre-empted by a distinct
discourse referent, denoting either the addressee as such or a second generic discourse
referent.
This is the case in the examples in (669). In (669a), 2Sg is initially used to
denote the addressee in a (meta-)pragmatic comment, after which 2Sg is used
generically. When a second generic discourse referent is introduced as boro 'someone'
in 'you call for someone,' it must remain distinct from 2Sg and so is mentioned in
3Sg form (a) in the following subjunctive clause. In (669b), two distinct generic
discourse referents (subscripted indices ""p"" and ""t"" in the free translation) are introduced
as boro. The first is then repeated in 2Sg form, which forces the second to adopt 3Sg
agreement (a in a na dam).

"8.6.5 Relativization and focus
In many languages, relative clauses make use of a construction that operates, in main
clauses, as either a topicalizing or a focalizing mechanism. That is, a construction that
functions in main clauses to indicate more or less clearcut discourse categories is
appropriated in relatives to indicate coreference between the relativized NP and the head
NP. It follows that the relevant construction is not available to mark true topic or
focus in relative clauses.
In KCh, relativization formally resembles the main-clause focus constructions,
since both front (extract) an NP, leaving at most a phonologically null trace in the
original site. Nonetheless, relativization and focalization are autonomous and may cooccur. We need to consider in turn four cases defined by the intersection of two240 8 Discourse-functional constructions and relativization
variables: a) the relativized NP (or a PP containing it) is the same as or different from
the focalized constituent; and b) the focalized constituent is subject or nonsubject.
When a nonsubject NP is relativized on, it is fairly common for the subject NP to
be separately focalized, as in (431).

'people, whomx you [focus] have brought tx ''Ants' (43la) and 'you' (43Ib) are the focalized subjects, with SFoc rjga. (43la)
has a resumptive pronoun (3Sg ga), suggesting that the intervening focalization has
blocked extraction of the relative pronoun. The result is that the relative clause has the
form of a main clause, and one can argue that a ""restart"" has occurred. The type in
(43Ib), where extraction has occurred in spite of the intervening focalization (note the
phonologically unrealized trace), is less common but is attested several times.
It is not so common for a relativized subject NP to also be overtly focalized.
However, (432) shows that this can be done when the relativized subject NP is
expressed as an overt (i.e. resumptive) pronoun. In the usual situation where this is a
third person pronoun, it takes ""3F"" form (3SgF rjga, 3P1F rjgi-yd) since it is focalized
(by the following SFoc rjga). This construction, seen in (432), perhaps really involves
a ""restart"" resulting in main-clause form.

(433b).","[255, 256]"
"4.4.2 Adjectives as noun modifiers (suffix -o or zero)
Verbs of adjectival quality can ordinarily be used as modifying adjectives in NPs, in
which case they take a lexically specified form. Those which do not take the participle

is -kasine 'mate, companion' and whose first member appears to be a true verb (90).
-kasine is used only as a compound final, cf. cere 'mate, peer, friend' and other lexical
choices for the simple noun.

bey the Abstr nominal is bey-rey).
The noun noqgu 'place' can be used as a compound final with a broad range of
initials. (KS uses -doo 'place' in similar compounds.) In (91a), the initial is clearly a
noun, compare the related verbs waafaku 'agree' and waa 'defecate'. However, the
initials in (91b) are identical to intransitive or transitive verb stems, and can be
construed as true verbs or in some cases possibly as zero-derived nominalizations.

'work' [verb or noun]The noun cere 'friend' is used (like English each other) in reciprocal constructions
('help friend' = 'help each other'). The combination of cere (in direct object function)
and a preceding verb can also be treated as a nominalized compound ('help friend' =
'mutual assistance'). For examples see the end of §10.2.6.",[97]
