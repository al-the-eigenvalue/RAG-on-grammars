Finally, the adverbial notion of a temporal negative, ‘never’, involves the cooccurrence of the generic negative marker ket with what could be analyzed as a temporal

structurally as a “circumclitic”. The temporal marker precedes the element under the
scope of negation, and the negative marker ket follows it, occupying the constituent final

Keenan (1976) proposes a set of criteria, which may apply to different languages to a
greater or lesser extent, for a definition of Subject as a universal category. The idea of
grammatical relations as a universal category has been questioned by Dryer (1997), who254points out that, while a set of criteria may be helpful to establish what similarities there
are amongst languages, these similarities do not explain why languages are the way they
are. Any similarities are, he claims, the reflexes of functional and cognitive processes
which themselves may be universal. Thus, it is not grammatical relations as such that are
universal. Each language displays its own relevant grammatical relations, which may or
may not coincide with the notions of “Subject” and “Object” as found in other languages.
In the analysis of Apinajé, I share Matthew Dryer’s view that the grammatical
relations of a language are specific to that language and may be defined according to
language internal criteria. In section 3.3 I have pointed out how distinct systems of
alignment interact in Apinajé. Thus, coding patterns and control properties relevant for
the establishment of grammatical relations in Apinajé include:(82) Relevant criteria for the establishment of grammatical relations in Apinajé
(a) word order
(b) person prefixes
(c) independent pronouns
(d) person inflection in imperative clauses
(e) the use of reflexives
(f) the occurrence of the realis marker in noun phrase coordination
(g) switch-reference strategies
(h) valency-changing operations
(i) ergative marking in subordinate clauses
(j) equi-deletion in complementation
(k) coreferential deletion in coordinationThe SOV word order (criterion (a)) is fairly rigid in Apinajé and serves as a useful
criterion of the identification of A and O. The use of person prefixes (b) reveals a split-255intransitive system in simple main clauses, and an absolutive pattern in nonfinite clauses.
To go along with the absolutive pattern, criterion (i) reveals an ergative case-marking
system that is conditioned by subordination environments. All other criteria (c-h; j-k)
betray a nominative pattern and provide strong support for the grammatical relation
Subject in Apinajé.
On the other hand, Direct Object is a less robust grammatical relation in the
language. The O argument forms a tight constituent with the following verb, and if the O
does not occur as a free form, then a personal prefix on the verb must index the person of
O. In addition to this morphosyntactic pattern, the accusative prefix set contains a uniqueform, the prefix ku-, which is the one criterion that unquestionably identifies the Direct
Object. Note that these criteria only identify the canonical O as Direct Object, leaving no
syntactic or morphological evidence for the combination of the canonical O category with
the many proposed noncanonical O arguments: these latter bear case-markers, cannot be
indexed on the verb, and show no evidence of constituency with the V. As such, we push
them to the next category, that of Indirect Object.
If Direct Object in Apinajé is not particularly robust, the evidence in favor of the
grammatical relation Indirect Object is limited to a single criterion: obligatoriness. In the
traditional ditransitive predicates, the third argument bears the dative case-marking, and
in the various noncanonical verb types seen in section 3.3.2, the second argument bears
one of four different case-markers, lexically determined by the verb. Thus, the category
of Indirect Object could be defined as those obligatory arguments that otherwise have no
morphological or syntactic patterns to unite them.","[266, 267, 268, 269]"
"IntroductionThe present chapter discusses those construction types that encompass more than one
predicator within a single syntactic unit. Arguments are typically shared, but that may not
necessarily be the case. In functional terms, what I will be discussing here are the
domains of (a) complementation, understood, in the sense of Noonan (1985), as a
complex structure involving a clause that serves as argument of a matrix verb; (b)
relativization, a clause that serves as modifier of a head noun, thus belonging within a
noun phrase; (c) adverbial clauses, those expressing contextual or circumstantial
information that serves as a frame for the main event described by the matrix verb, that is,
clauses that modify a verb phrase or clause; (d) constructions expressing aspectual
meanings, such as the inchoative, the progressive, and the continuous; and (e) the
comparative of superiority. Causative constructions, discussed in section IV.5.2, also
constitute one type of complex construction in Apinajé, since they are expressed by the
types of syntactic strategies described here.
In structural terms, these functional domains are expressed in Apinajé by means
of subordination embedding, parataxis, and serialization. Many cases of
complementation make use of embedding, while in others parataxis is used (Noonan2741985: 44; 55). The alternation between one type of construction and the other within this
domain is determined by the syntactic properties of complement-taking verbs, which are,
in general, of the non-canonical marking type. The alternation between subordination
and parataxis is observable also among the different types of adverbial clauses, although
parataxis is more frequently used.
On the other hand, relative clauses are always embedded inside the noun phrase.
Certain properties commonly found in subordinating constructions, such as the use of the
nonfinite form of verbs, are also necessarily employed in the expression the comparative
of superiority and one type of inchoative construction. The structural properties observed
in the latter cases, which are typologically less common, are crystallized and presumably
result from the diachronic development of source biclausal constructions, in which the
modern main verb was subordinate and the modern postverbal particle was the main verb.
The original main verbs eventually became reanalyzed and grammaticalized as function
words, which they still are in the synchronic stage of the language.
Serialization is a structural strategy often used for the expression of the
progressive and continuous aspects, as well as the more adverbial manner nuance.
The discussion proposed here is intended to be broad enough that it will touch on
the various structural strategies observed in the corpus for the expression of typologically
common functional domains, but it is by no means intended as an exhaustive account of
the inventory of complex predicates and constructions found in Apinajé. That is a task
that requires continued analysis of the data already found and yet to be included in my
database. For the time being, however, the present chapter should serve as a275representative sample. The formal properties of subordination, parataxis, and
serialization in Apinajé are introduced briefly in the remainder of this section; subsequent
sections elaborate on structure in further detail, along with the functional domains
expressed by each structure.
Subordination in Apinajé requires that the relevant verb be inflected for
nonfiniteness. The ergative case marker may or may not mark the A argument,
depending on coreference conditions. In complementation, the distribution of a
subordinate predicate is the same as that of the equivalent nominal. The matrix verb
occurs in final position, postposed to the subordinated element.
Paratactic clauses are finite, displaying the very same structure as independent
simple clauses. Parataxis may require the same-subject or different-subject switchreference markers, where pertinent, and it often involves morphemes from the TAM clitic
inventory.
Serialization requires the nonfinite form of verbs when the (causative or
instrumental morpheme) verb  ‘do’ is involved. Otherwise, it is just the bare form of
verbs that occur in a sequence; in this case, the verbs involved are usually from the class
of intransitives (i.e. they take no inflection in their finite form). In Apinajé, serialization
always involves either a movement verb or a position verb. Not all verbs belonging to
each category are eligible for serial constructions expressing aspectual meanings, but
only a selected few. When verbs from outside this inventory are used, the resulting
overall meaning of the construction is more literal than grammatical, sometimes yielding
awkward or jocose meanings.","[287, 288, 289]"
"202Noun modification is also expressed by noun phrases consisting of a noun and a
nonfinite verb form. In these cases, the nonfinite verb is the head of the noun phrase,
which derives from a verbal predicate construction, whereas the other nominal involved
serves as the modifier (6). That the nonfinite verb is part of a noun phrase is
demonstrable by its distribution and its function in the clause: it is surrounded by a noun
and the definite article ja, and it is an argument of the main predicator (6.b). Note that
the relational prefix occurs, since the head of the noun phrase, ire, begins in a vowel; the
pattern is comparable to that of the genitive construction introduced above.(6) a. [br -ire]

washDeterminers. In phrases where the head noun co-occurs with a determiner, the head does
not appear phrase finally, since determinants are positional clitics that necessarily follow
the nominal element they refer to. Determiners include the definite articles ja ‘singular’
and je ‘collective’, and the indefinite article õ ‘some; a; one’ (8).2 Demonstrative
pronouns also fall in this functional and distributional category, following the head noun

noticeable, among other things, by the distribution of each: the determiner follows the head; the

3
In this context, the indefinite article õ is pronounced as [õt]. It is not yet clear whether the reduced
consonant at coda position is morphological material, the result of a phonological process, or merely a
phonetic effect. Compared to that, there are instances in which the definite article ja in pronominal
function is also pronounced as the more “extended” form [ari]; under these circumstances, however, it
usually has the more adverbial meaning ‘here’. Thus, the alternation in shape is justifiable as the result of a
morphological process.","[215, 216, 217, 218]"
"298The morphosyntactic and distributional facts about the negative morphemes
suggest that they may have all originated diachronically from verbal sources. At least in
regard to the morpheme ket, a plausible hypothesis is that it must have started out as a
monosyllabic negative predicator of tV structure, and that the kV- syllable is a reflex of
the accusative prefix ku-, also noted in other function words, such as kumrc ‘INTS’ and
kt ‘3.ERG’, among others (see chapter IV). The hypothetical predicator *tV must have
been responsible for the negation of the proposition described in the clause, thus
requiring the nonfinite form of the subordinate verb; whereas the morpheme ku- could
have operated as an anaphoric/resumptive pronoun, referring back to the negated
proposition. Verbs do take noun phrases as arguments; and it is quite possible that the
distribution of ku- was restricted to cases of propositional, not nominal, negation in a past
stage of Apinajé.1 However, since the most frequent scope of negation is the proposition,
the use of the *kVtV form may have become more standardized, leading to its reanalysis
as the negative stem of Apinajé thus replacing other related forms elsewhere in the
grammar. As far as phonological changes, one could speculate a path such as *kute >
*kete > ket, for Apinajé, with vowel harmony and eventual deletion of the stem final
vowel. In any case, it is no longer possible to speak of ket and ketne as true verbs in1In Kaingang (Southern Jê), one of the negative markers is indeed a monosyllabic morpheme beginning in
/t/: tõ ‘NEG’ (Wiesemann 1986). However, in that language this form of the negative is employed in narrow
scope negation, specifically, in the negation of nouns; sentential negation is expressed by a similar ket
morpheme. (Thanks to Eduardo Ribeiro for calling my attention to this piece of data, in personal
communication.)299Apinajé. These morphemes have now become positional clitics which do not display the
full morphosyntactic behavior and semantic content of a lexical verb.
Other elements that may have involved the prefix ku- in earlier times include the
ergative markers and the intensifier kumrc. While it seems plausible that the intensifier
may have evolved from a verb, given its final position in the clause and the role it
performs, as a modifier of the predicate, the same may not be said of the ergative
markers.
The ergative markers t and kt must have evolved from a nominal source. My
claim is based on their distribution in the sentence and their function in present-day
Apinajé syntax, as case markers of nominal elements. However, the possibility that the
prefix ku- may have participated in the development of the suppletive third-person form
of the ergative is also present here – a path that I propose for the other two postpositions
that display suppletive forms, namely, the detrimentive and the dative, as well. The
hypothesis is displayed schematically below:(1)*ku-m

kt‘3.DAT’
‘3.DTR’
‘3.ERG’The idea proposed in (1) is that all three postpositional markers may once have
been used with the third person prefix ku. With the frequency of use, the vowels involved
underwent certain phonological changes, such that non-low vowels ended up in full
harmony, whereas in the environment of a low vowel, only partial asimilation took place,300such that the high back vowel became lowered. Eventually, all word-final vowels were
lost, giving way to a heavy monosyllabic word.
In this vein, it is hoped that this description of Apinajé will serve as a basis for
future historical and comparative work, which will allow the testing of the various
internal reconstructions proposed here, and which will also allow the creation of new,
fruitful comparative hypotheses for the reconstruction of the phonology and grammar of
Proto-Jê.","[311, 312, 313, 314]"
"3.1.3. Postpositions
Postpositions constitute a (rather large) closed class in Apinajé. Postpositions occur
postposed to their object noun phrase or, in the absence of an overt dependent noun
phrase, they inflect for person in the same way as Verbs and Nouns. The set of person
prefixes used is the same for all three lexical categories, as is the complementary
distribution between prefixes and noun phrases.
The fact that Postposition is viewed here as a lexical category might seem at odds
with the fact that postpositions are function words. However, even though a clear set of
standard postpositions (monosyllabic, high frequency of use, with more grammatical than
lexical meaning) does exist in the language, other members of this category seem more
like postpositions-in-the-making, evolving from a class of nouns that I will term here
“relator nouns.” For that reason, it is almost innaccurate to speak of postpositions in
Apinajé as constituting a closed class; perhaps this might be best described as a “halfway
open” class.
Relator nouns are lexemes whose semantics extend metaphorically into
grammatical meanings related to space orientation and position. Typically, relator nouns
are body part terms, or part-whole terms which pattern as inalienable nouns in languages
that make this distinction (DeLancey 1997). This kind of diachronic development is140fairly common crosslinguistically. In Apinajé, it is possible to observe, at the synchronic
level, hints of the grammaticalization of some nouns into postpositions, as will be seen.
Although there seems to exist a tendency for postpositions to evolve from nouns
in Apinajé, there is at least one instance of a postposition having a verb as its diachronic
source. That is the case of the instrumental postposition  and the verb  ‘do’ (Oliveira
1998).
The set of grammatical postpositions and some selected relator nouns are
introduced in what follows.","[153, 154]"
"232The noncanonical marking of core arguments is understood here, with Onishi
(2001), as those patterns that deviate from the standard patterns of argument marking
used in a given language. In the case of Apinajé, the canonical pattern is the use of free
pronouns to indicate SA/SO/A (nominative pattern), and bound person markers to indicate
SO/O (absolutive pattern). Noncanonical marking in Apinajé then involves the use ofvarious postpositions for the expression of what appear to be core arguments, that is,
participants that are obligatorily required by verbs.
In the remainder of this section, I will tentatively depart from the assumption that
the patterns of Apinajé laid out here involve the noncanonical marking of core
arguments; at this point, this assumption is based simply on (a) the frequency and
consistency with which certain postpositions come associated with certain verbs; and (b)
the fact that these combinations sometimes result in significantly distinct meanings from
those of the base verbs, as if in a derivational relation. Supporting grammatical evidence
is presented in section 4.
Noncanonical marking in Apinajé is noticeable with verbs of cognition, emotion,
utterance, and sensation, among others. The patterns observed with these verbs all depart
from the basic canonical patterns of argument marking and involve many sorts of
postpositions – from locative, to dative, to instrumental to ergative. The semantic subcategorization of such predicators corresponds somewhat to the kinds of postpositions
used, but not necessarily so.","[245, 246]"
"235Bivalent non-canonical predicators. Bivalent non-canonical predicators come in a
variety of patterns. The primary difference between the patterns is whether A or O is
noncanonically marked, and secondarily whether we should think of some of these as
extended intransitives rather than noncanonical transitives. We begin with two clear
cases of noncanonical A: some verbs require that the A be marked as a dative, others that
it be marked as ergative.
The verbs that require a dative A include verbs of liking, disliking, refusal, fear,
and desire. The latter three occur as complement-taking verbs as well, as may be seen in
the examples. The clause begins with the nominative pronoun in first or second position,
followed a bit later by a coreferential dative-marked A argument; the O follows the
canonical pattern, either occurring as a noun phrase immediately adjacent to the verb, or
indicated morphologically with bound pronouns ((51-52); O-NP’s are within brackets).","[248, 249]"
"Noun modification. Noun modification may be expressed by the juxtaposition of nouns,
with the difference that no genitive marking needs to be involved. In (4), the phrases
consist of all alienable nouns. The relative ordering of dependent and head elements is
the opposite of the standard pattern in (4.b): the modifier follows the head noun.
Examples such as this are exceptional; there are only two such cases in my database, both
of which involve the word kupe ‘non-Indian’.1(4) a. kupe
foreigndi
woman‘foreign woman’b. kupe
foreignpai
Indian‘Indian-like foreigner’The function of noun modification may be performed by noun phrases involving
inalienable nouns (5).",[215]
"RelativizationRelativization in Apinajé is necessarily expressed by means of subordination. Thus,
other morphosyntactic properties internal to Apinajé relative clauses include the facts that
the verb must occur in its nonfinite form and, if it is a transitive verb, the ergative case
marker must occur on the first nominal constituent of the subordinate clause.
Additionally, the definite marker ja must occur at the end boundary of the clause, being
optionally preceded by the agent nominalizer cw, which occurs most often (though not
strictly) with verbs of action or activity. The order of elements remains basically the
same as in simple clauses.
Relativization is carried out by means of both internal and external relative
clauses (meaning “internally headed” and “externally headed,” as in the terminology and
typology proposed in Keenan 1985, inter alia). The choice for one or the other strategy
depends on the position being relativized. Positions that may be relativized are A, S, O
and the dative/recipient (Keenan and Comrie 1977; Givón 2001b). When an external
relative clause is employed, it will be of the postnominal type, as the RC will come
postposed to the head noun.
Of the positions that may be relativized, S and O form verb phrase-internal
absolutives and are thus grammatically required to occur in internally headed relative
clauses; however, the head may occur externally if a third person resumptive pronoun is
employed in the required position. The ergative A is always external to the RC, with the
person prefix (or the suppletive form) of the ergative marker serving as a resumptive282pronoun. A relativized dative participant is external to the RC, with no need for a
resumptive pronoun.
The examples in (6) illustrate these points. (6.a) shows the regular use of the verb
are ‘tell’ in a simple clause, for comparison with the other constructions. In (6.b), the
noun b ‘man’ is the understood head of the RC and occurs within the restrictive clause.
That is so because b is the second argument of the verb are, and accordingly, it occurs
immediately preposed to the verb, which takes the relational prefix; the same is true of di
‘woman’ in (6.c), the S argument of the verb ca ‘stand’. In (6.c-d), on the other hand, the
relativized element di ‘woman’ is the A argument of are ‘tell’. The external relative
strategy applies in this case, with the restrictive clause following the head noun. Notice in
(6.d) the presence of the third person ergative marker kt inside the subordinate clause;
the ergative case marker is coreferential with the external head noun and serves as a
resumptive pronoun.(6) a. pa

‘This woman who told me about you has already left.’The examples in (7-9) further illustrate the point. In (8), the relativized element is
the dative participant, which also occurs internally in the relative clause. Thus the
instances in which externally headed relative clauses occur include mostly cases of
ergative relativization, but are not limited to this. For instance, consider (9.b), where the
second argument of the verb, mekdc ‘medication’, appears in initial position in the
sentence. Inside the relative clause, the subordinate verb appears without the relational
prefix, since its object is not contiguous to it. Examples of this kind were not very
frequent during elicitation sessions. It is possible that this fronting of the object of the RC
is a pragmatic strategy for placing it under focus, in which case this construction would
be more marked than those in which the relativized object occurs internal to the relative
clause. It is also possible that this is all artefacts of elicitation; further (textual) examples
are still needed for clarification of this point.","[295, 296, 297]"
"Noun phrase coordination. Three distinct strategies for noun phrase coordination have
been noted in my database. The first involves the use of the conjunction ne; the next
employs the associative morpheme me in conjunction with the dual marker wa; and the
last strategy involves the expression (ne) kacw, which translates approximately as ‘in
addition to; along with’. The conjunction ne is also used for clausal coordination, in
which context it performs the more specialized function of ‘same subject’ marker (see
further details in section 4).
The examples in (17) illustrate the use of ne. The coordinate noun phrases are the
arguments of the transitive verbs bu ‘see’ and gõ ‘give’, and the intransitive te ‘go’. In
(17.a), only the conjunction is used, whereas the dual marker co-occurs with it in (17.bc). In the latter examples, we notice two tokens of the realis marker na – once210introducing the coordinate noun phrases, and the second time introducing the clause as
such. Here, the dual marker wa refers back to the noun phrase referents, which are
somewhat emphasized in this type of construction.(17) a. pa

giveFactors that may be of relevance for the double occurrence of the realis marker in
this context are (a) that the arguments expressed by the coordinate noun phrases are A/S,
and (b) that they are not encoded by pronouns. Were these arguments to be expressed as
pronouns, the pattern for syntactically encoded emphasis on them would be the double
occurrence of the pronoun itself; and had they been O arguments, the dual clitic could
have been dispensed with, as in (17.a).
As pointed out earlier, the number clitics wa and m generally precede the noun
phrase they modify, follow the pronoun they modify, and precede the verb whose bound
prefix they modify. In these conjunction examples, the first impulse might be to assume
that they modify the preceding noun phrase, which would be structurally odd. However,211this is not the case: the realis clitic na marks the right boundary of the conjoined S/A noun
phrase in (17.b-c), leaving wa to serve as a resumptive pronoun.
When a conjoined noun phrase is in O function, the resumptive pronoun slot is not
available. In this case, wa can occur only as a modifier of the third person form of the
verb (18.a), in which case the O noun phrase is not within the verb phrase, but stands as a
preverbal adjunct. The attempt to force an analysis with wa as a post-NP modifier fails,
as seen in (18.b): wa cannot be interpreted as the dual marker when it comes between the
conjoined noun phrase and a transitive verb bearing a relational prefix (indicating
contiguity with its O argument). Here, wa can only be interpreted as the homophonous
noun ‘tooth’, and the conjoined noun phrase must be its possessor.(18) a. pa

valid for the examples involving the expression (ne) kacw, which has the same

that, here too, the dual marker may be dispensed with, when the coordinates constitute
the O argument of the verb (19.d). The morpheme kacw can also function as an
inchoative marker in a different type of construction (section V.4).","[223, 224, 225]"

‘3’)Person inflection occupies the most external morphological slot in a word. Person
prefixes encode first, second, and third persons, that refer to the objects of Postpositions,
the possessor in Nouns, and the absolutive arguments of Verbs. There are three third
person prefixes: ku-, i- and Ø-. The zero prefix is the only one used with all three word
classes. The prefix ku- occurs exclusively with transitive verbs (there is one instance of
ku- with a postposition) and the prefix i-, very marginally, with nouns. The accusative
prefix ku- has further distributional restrictions: it occurs exclusively with the finite form181of verbs, only in monosyllabic stems, and is employed when the accusative noun phrase
is not contiguous to the verb, but elsewhere in the clause (section IV.2.3).
The nonfinite form of a verb performs a more nominal role in the syntax (section
IV.2.1). The set of prefixes employed with nonfinite forms is reduced, as compared tothat of finite verb forms, because only the third person zero prefix (not ku-) may occur.
The third person form i- does not occur very frequently. Although the occurrence
of i- seems to coincide consistently with the absence of a dependent noun phrase
contiguous to the head noun (137), Ø- may also appear in this context (138). It seems,
then, that the use of i- is lexically, rather than phonologically or grammatically,
motivated.(137) a. [[Ken kr] krat] õ

classes. There is a set each of noun, verb and postposition stems that include the
formative i- (sections 3.1.1.2 and 3.1.2.2). The formative ku- does not seem to occur on
postpositions, except – hypothetically – as the source of the suppletive forms found in
some postposition paradigms. The distinction between person prefixes as productive
morphology and i- and ku- as formatives resides in the fact that stems containing either of
these formatives may be inflected for (any) person.
An accusative person prefix is in complementary distribution with its referent
noun phrase, as seen above. The pattern with descriptives seems more like one of
agreement, since both the prefix and an independent pronoun indicate the same referent
in the clause (section IV.2.3); however, it is the prefix that actually encodes the argument
of a descriptive: in casual speech, the independent pronoun may be omitted, but not the
prefix (see chapter IV).","[194, 195, 196]"
"277As already mentioned, the use of subordination for the expression of
complementation requires that the subordinate verb be in its nonfinite form. The
subordinate clause occupies some position between the matrix verb, which occurs in final
position, and the positional clitics normally occupying sentence-initial position. Since
the complement-taking verbs noted all involve the use of a postposition for marking one
of the core arguments (which could be either A or O, depending on the verb), it is often
the case that the clausal complement will be immediately preceded by this case marker,
when A is the noncanonically marked argument.
The examples in (1.a-d) illustrate the parallel distribution of clausal complements
with that of an O noun phrase. The noun phrase in (1.a) occurs immediately preposed to
the matrix verb (which therefore displays its relational prefix-equivalent form pubu) and
postposed to the dative phrase that indicates the A argument of the verb in question.
In (1.b-c), the subordinate verbs are transitive and intransitive, respectively; the
internal structure of the clausal complement thus reflects this difference in transitivity.
Comparing (1.b) with (1.d), in which both subordinate verbs are transitive, it is possible
to notice the presence of the ergative marker in the latter, but not in the former. The
ergative case marker in (1.d) indicates that the A argument of the subordinate verb is not
coreferential with that of the matrix. The subordinate A arguments is thus overtly
expressed in the embedded clause.(1) a. nai-m [kuke]

verb is slightly different than that of (1). In (1), the matrix verb stem follows a transitive
pattern of inflection, whereas in (2), the matrix verb follows a descriptive pattern of
inflection. That is, in (2), the first argument of the matrix verb is indicated by both an
independent pronoun (when it occurs) and the person prefix attached to the verb. In its
turn, the dative marker attaches to the constituent that refers to the (noncanonically
marked) O argument of the verb in question. When that constituent is a clausal
complement, the dative marker follows the final boundary of the subordinate clause.","[290, 291, 292]"
"The list certainly includes criteria that cannot be taken to the letter, or, as Dixon
and Aikhenvald put it, they must be “tempered by a number of caveats”. In the case of
Apinajé, at least two of those certainly do not apply, namely, criteria (d, e). As will be
seen, relational prefixes, for instance, can certainly appear more than once in a word
(section 3.1.2.4, example (63)). In addition, a relational prefix must necessarily co-occur89with a person prefix in the context of a vowel-initial stem; and both relational and person
prefixes are inflectional morphemes in Apinajé.
Dixon and Aikhenvald call attention to the fact that a phonological word – or, the
word as defined by its phonological properties – in a given language, may or may not
coincide with a grammatical word in the same language. Thus, a grammatical word may
consist of more than one phonological word or, likewise, a phonological word may
consist of more than one grammatical word. In the first case, they cite the example of
Yimas (Foley 1991: 86, cited in Dixon and Aikhenvald 2002), in which compounds
(grammatical words) are composed of more than one phonological word (the
participating nouns), in that they bear individual primary stresses. As an illustration of
the second case, they cite examples of one positional clitic in Dyirbal (p. 27-28).
In Apinajé, as will be seen, a grammatical word may comprise more than one
phonological word. The grammatical and phonological criteria for the delimitation of the
word in Apinajé are addressed next.","[102, 103]"

Onishi (2001) observes that languages with clear syntactic derivations have
constraints on many clause-linking devices; for instance, they may required that one of
two coreferential arguments be deleted in such contexts (what Dixon 1994 terms “pivot
conditions”). Languages in which semantic roles dominate the process typically lack
these constraints, whereas languages with noncanonically marked arguments have an271intermediary status. In general, noncanonically marked A/S are more likely to control
pivot constraints than to become targets of such constraints. Some languages allow
predicates with non-canonically marked A/S to occur both in the main and the
complement clause. In general, restrictions on the occurrence of predicates with
noncanonically marked arguments are more likely to apply when they function as target
of coreferential deletion in the complement clause.
In Apinajé, most, if not all complement-taking verbs are noncanonical predicates.
There seems to be no restrictions as far as the occurrence of noncanonical predicates in
complement positions either. Under coreferentiality conditions, all relevant arguments are
marked with person prefixes on the verb and the postposition, as applicable. However, no
independent pronouns occur in the subordinate clause, that is, there is A/S coreferential
deletion. On the other hand, when there is no coreferentiality between A and/or S of both
clauses, the occurrence of the ergative marker in the subordinate clause is obligatory.(107) a. i-m

At this point, sufficient evidence has converged to argue for a convincing
grammatical category of Subject, a morphologically heterogeneous category that is united
by syntactic behaviors. In future research, this category might become even stronger, as
the database lacked examples of noncanonical predicates with noun phrase coordination,
in sentences that engage the switch reference system, and in valency-changing
derivations. In any of these, the noncanonical A arguments might share yet one more
syntactic pattern with the canonical A.
In contrast, the search for syntactic properties that distinguish the categories of
Direct Object and Indirect Object was unsuccessful, leaving a potentially interesting topic
for future research.","[284, 285, 286]"

Inflectional and derivational affixes are often monosyllabic morphemes whose structure
is restricted to the V(C) and CV(C) syllable patterns. Certain inflectional affixes may
consist of a single consonant, as is the case with relational prefixes and nonfiniteness
suffixes (sections 4.1.2. and 4.1.3.). Affixes do not display any particular stress
properties in Apinajé; they simply contribute segmental material to the phonological
word, submitting to the overall stress rule applicable to that word. The verb pi ‘kill’ is
inflected for person in (5). The finite form of the verb is shown in (a), and its nonfinite
form in (b).(5) a. ic-pi

they too were affixes at an earlier stage in the development of the language. For instance,
it is possible to identify personal prefixes that have been reanalyzed as part of some
stems, which take productive inflectional morphology at the synchronic level (6).(6) a. kupe

Clitics may be of three kinds: positional clitics, phrasal clitics and word clitics, all of
which display specific stress properties and, like the roots, may come in any of the
syllable patterns available. Positional clitics occupy specific slots in the structure of the
clause, and they usually encode grammatical categories that pertain to the proposition as
a whole, such as mood, tense, aspect and the like (7). Few phrasal clitics indicate the
initial boundary of a phrase; the tendency is for them to occur phrase finally (8). The
same is true of word clitics, except that their structural domain is restricted to the
(grammatical) word (9).22As mentioned in footnote 3 of chapter II, throughout this dissertation I will use the symbol “=” to indicate
clitic boundaries, but only in the case of word clitics. Positional (phrase and clause) clitics will be simply86(7) a. pa

territory (Nimuendajú 1983).172.1. Genetic affiliation
Apinajé is classified as a Northern Jê language, along with Panará, Suyá, Kayapó, and
Timbira. Other branches of the family are Central Jê, which includes the Akwe
languages (Xavante and Xerente) and Southern Jê, consisting of Kaingáng and Xokléng.
Most Jê languages are spoken in cerrado areas, with the exception of Kayapó and Suyá,
spoken in rainforest areas (see e.g. Rodrigues 1986; 1999).
A brief examination of data from Apinajé, Suyá, Kayapó and Timbira may reveal
the many differences (e.g. prenasalized stops, nominative case-marking in independent
clauses) and similarities (e.g. simple morphology, SOV word order, ergative marking in
subordinate clauses) existing among them. Panará, on the other hand, is dramatically
distinct from the other languages of the branch. It displays a more polysynthetic
morphological typology, with agent, patient and tense/aspect/modality (TAM) marking on
the verb; ergative marking in independent clauses and SVO word order, among other
things.1816The area is known in Brazil as “Bico do Papagaio” (‘the parrot’s beak’).","[40, 41]"

One set of nouns includes prefixes that occur more productively in verbs, namely,
the middle prefixes (a-, aw-, am-; see section 3.1.2.4). When attached to verbs, these
prefixes typically result in detransitivization of the base. A similar result holds with
nouns, in that the valency of the noun may also be reduced: inalienable nouns become
alienable after the derivation (44.a). There is one instance in which the opposite is true,
with the derivation departing from an alienable noun (44.b). Other cases involve the use
of verbal roots as bases, a role that may be performed by transitive, intransitive or
descriptive verbs (44.c-d). Sequences of morphemes belonging to the “middle
inventory,” such as aw- and am-, apply to these verbal bases for noun derivation.(44) a. akro

"IntroductionFor the unacquainted observer, Apinajé may appear as a morphologically plain language
of the analytic kind, consisting of rather short words, and having much of its grammatical
categories expressed by function words rather than bound morphemes. That impression
is justified: Apinajé morphemes are monosyllabic indeed, and the grammatical
categories found in the language are often expressed by function words that may or may
not be phonologically dependent, or by syntactic constructions that often times employ a
subset of these very function words.
However, Apinajé words are not necessarily monomorphemic – nor
monosyllabic, for that matter. Words consisting of more than one syllable usually consist
of as many morphemes; and Apinajé morphology is rather rich, especially in regard to
content words. Thus, Apinajé may be typologically characterized as an agglutinating
language of analytic spirit, with compounding and prefixation playing major roles in
word formation. The predominance of prefixes over suffixes is reminiscent of the fact
that Apinajé is a head final language: syntactically dependent elements serve as a
diachronic source for phonologically dependent ones.",[95]

The purpose of this dissertation is to present a description of the language spoken by the
Apinajé, one of the Northern Jê peoples of Central Brazil. The study is based on original
data collected by the author in various trips to the field between October 1995 and
August 2000, as well as in interviews with speakers of the language in the city of
Goiânia, Goiás State, Brazil. Rather than a definite account of the language, this work is
intended as the kernel of what will evolve into a more comprehensive grammar as further
analysis is conducted; for the time being, my main goal is to lay out as many patterns as
can possibly be distilled from the available data, regarding the phonology, morphology,
lexicon, and syntax of the language. From a broader perspective, I hope this study will
serve as an effective source for historical-comparative work aiming at the reconstruction
of the Jê linguistic family, and thus constitute an additional piece for the better
understanding of the Macro-Jê stock, a still hypothetical classification for a number of
little-documented South American languages.
The dissertation discusses the principal facts about Apinajé and includes three
appendices: selected maps, a sample collection of texts and a preliminary dictionary. The
remainder of this chapter presents general information about the Apinajé people,
including some details about their culture and social organization; geographical,
historical, and demographic facts; observations about language contact situations and the2school system available in the communities; as well as details about the genetic affiliation
and previous studies done on the language. Methodological considerations and
information about the database for the study, as well as conventions used in the text, are
also presented in this chapter.
Because most previous studies focus on the phonology of Apinajé, the core of my
research project has been devoted primarily to the study of its grammar. Nonetheless,
facts about its phonology and morphophonology were also captured during my time in
and out of the field. These observations are presented in Chapter II, along with a
discussion of previous literature on Apinajé phonology. Chapter III is an introduction to
Apinajé morphology in which the relevant morphological units and categories are
presented. Chapter IV presents the syntactic and morphosyntactic properties of phrases
and simple clauses. Subordination, serialization and other kinds of complex
constructions are discussed in Chapter V. Chapter VI is the concluding section; it
summarizes the major facts about Apinajé discussed in this work, includes some
language internal hypotheses about the development of certain forms and structures, and
points to areas that deserve further investigation. Illustrative maps regarding the history
and geographical distribution of the Apinajé are found in Appendix A. Appendix B
provides three text samples: a traditional story, a personal experience narrative, and an
instructional narrative. Appendix C, the Apinajé Dictionary, was created out of the
material available the general database I started in 1995, in addition to the items I
collected primarily my the lexicographical project. Appendix D is a list of abbreviations
used in the glosses.","[9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16]"

may replace the noun phrase headed by a postposition. Otherwise, in the absence of a
full noun phrase, it is a person prefix or the reflexive or reciprocal clitics that attach to the
postposition, serving as cross-reference markers (26).(26) a. jakamDEF.ARTb.atpe

postpositions take a zero prefix for third person; others have irregular third person forms
(see diachronic hypothesis in section III.3.1.3). In these cases, the quantifier occurs
preposed to the postposition itself (27).",[229]

languages as the noun for ‘thing’ (cf. e.g. Ribeiro (2004) and references therein). Even
though this may be true from a diachronic point of view, evidence indicates that
synchronically this is not the case in Apinajé. This morpheme õ – not to be confused with
the indefinite article õ – is limited in distribution to genitive constructions: it does not
occur anywhere as an independent lexical item. In addition, there are other words that
presently encode the meaning ‘thing’: bj ‘thing’ and kukre ‘belongings’ (76.a-b).m=bj

Spike GildeaThe dissertation is a preliminary grammatical description of the language spoken
by the Apinajé, one of the Northern Jê peoples of Central Brazil. It discusses the core
facts about Apinajé phonology, morphology and syntax from a functional-typlogical
perspective, and provides three appendices: selected maps, a sample collection of texts
and a preliminary dictionary. The phonological analysis proposes an alternative
interpretation for the inventory of phonemes as compared to earlier analyses, pointing to
phonemic distinctions not previously noted, which might lead to interesting findings
regarding the historical development of the language. Apinajé morphemes are typically
monosyllabic and the language makes ample use of function words for the expression of
grammatical categories, properties that are characteristic of analytic languages.
Nonetheless, Apinajé morphology is more complex than it might seem at first, especially
with respect to the major lexical categories of the language: Nouns, Verbs andv
Postpositions. These word classes, especially Nouns and Verbs, are characterized
morphologically by the presence of formatives, which are recurrent morphs that are either
semantically empty or of elusive meaning, but which subcategorize words in formal or
semantic terms. The categories of nonfiniteness, person, and syntactic constituency
constitute the core of inflectional morphology, the last applying to nouns, postpositions,
and verbs. Verbs are subcategorized morphosyntactically into transitives, intransitives
and descriptives, displaying a split intransitivity system with respect to verbal personmarking. Word order is predominantly SOV. Syntactically complex constructions
include verb serialization and clause subordination, with ergative case-marking a
characteristic of subordinate clauses.","[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]"
"2293.3.1. Canonical predicates
The major morphosyntactic classes of verbs, as seen in section III.3.1.2.1, are those that
comprise (di)transitive verbs, intransitive verbs, and descriptive verbs. It should be noted
from the start that, for each verb class, specific participants are understood as core
arguments (A, S, O, E) because they are necessarily required by the verb. However, the
core argument status of some of these participants may or may not be supported by a
robust set of grammatical criteria in Apinajé, as will be seen in section 4.
Transitive and descriptive verbs are inflected for person according to an
absolutive pattern. In the former class, person prefixes are pronominal, that is, they stand
for the O argument itself; this is what is referred to here as “cross-referencing”. In the
latter class, person prefixes agree with independent pronouns in the indexation of the sole
argument of the verb, i.e. S.
Intransitive verbs do not take person inflection in simple clauses, and thus form a
split intransitivity pattern along with descriptives, as both types are monovalent. The
split between descriptives and intransitives corresponds in large part to the semantic
distinction between states as against events and activities, but it is not guided by it. The
sub-categorization is basically of a morphosyntactic nature (for a detailed discussion
about descriptive verbs see Oliveira 2003).
Contrasting to bound person inflection, the use of independent pronouns follows a
nominative pattern. Indeed, nominative free pronouns are nearly obligatory in any simple230clause. Pronouns express the pertinent (S/A) arguments of all intransitive, descriptive and
transitive verbs.(47) a. naka

RLSThus, the structure of simple clauses in Apinajé betrays a combination of split
intransitivity and nominative alignment patterns – all this relative to agreement and crossreferencing, however. It is only in the context of subordination that ergativity is overtly
expressed by case markers (see chapter V). These patterns comprise the canonical
marking of arguments in Apinajé verbal clauses.","[242, 243, 244]"
"2.2. Postpositional phrase
The structure of postpositional phrases is quite consistent regardless of the
morphosyntactic properties of the noun phrases involved. Vowel-initial postpositions
require relational prefixes, as usual. Objects of postpositions may be simplex noun
phrases, coordinated noun phrases and nonfinite clauses (22-24).(22) a. [i--õkw]

"164The alternation between m õ, wa õ and m u, wa u appears to be phonetically
motivated; these pronouns seem to result of a combination of the indefinite pronoun õ
with each of the number markers m and wa.
In addition to these two pronouns, the form mbj ‘something’ also consists of
two morphemes, the plural/nonreferential marker m plus bj ‘thing’. This form also
serves as an interrogative pronoun, as will be seen.(109) a. Ka

3-hearDemonstrative pronouns. Demonstrative pronouns observed in the database are ja, muj,
ne, and stems formed with the deitic tar. The latter morpheme occurs in the
demonstratives ictar ‘here’, atar ‘there.PRX’ and mutar ‘there.DST’. Although the
morpheme tar is morphologically and semantically comparable to postpositions, in that it165takes person inflection and is deictic in nature, its distribution is restricted to the lexical
items just presented; that is, tar does not occur productively as head of postpositional
phrases. In addition, its semantic content is not transparent, if analyzed in isolation.
The word ja has the primary function of a definite article within a noun phrase;
muj and atar are demonstratives that operate either as full pronouns or as determiners of
the noun. The present section focuses on the pronominal role of these markers. For
details about their function, distribution, and morphological properties within the noun
phrase, see section IV.2.1. The forms ictar and mutar are used mostly as locatives and are
not discussed here.
The semantic contrast between ja and muj is that the former operates as a
proximal demonstrative pronoun, while the latter is a distal demonstrative. When in
demonstrative function, ja is typically stressed; thus, the root-initial glide /j/ is realized as
a voiced alveo-palatal fricative [z]. Ja does not seem to carry any specification as to a
particular deictic center: it may indicate a referent close to both speaker and listener,
away from both, or close to either one or the other. On the other hand, muj and atar do
each refer to a particular deictic center.
The demonstrative muj ‘that’, which has the alternate form mu (apparently
phonologically motivated), points to a referent away from listener and speaker. Atar ‘that
[close to you]’ consists of the second person prefix a- and the deictic morpheme tar. The
presence of the second person prefix is overt indication of the deictic center for this
demonstrative.","[177, 178, 179]"

"Postpositions. As mentioned previously, oblique participants are targets of reflexivization
controlled by the subject. In cases of oblique reflexivization, the reflexive pronoun
attaches to the relevant postposition, which may occur with a relational prefix, as needed.
Among all postpositions, the dative frequently allows for phonological truncation, being
realized simply as a bilabial nasal consonant in word-final position. In this case, the
stress of the reflexive clitic is the relevant one in the phonological word. Compare

The declarative, interrogative and imperative speech-acts correspond to morphological
and structural distinctions in Apinajé. Declarative clauses have the structural properties
of the types just introduced.
Polarity questions may be expressed with exactly the same kind of structure as
simple declarative clauses, but with a distinct intonation pattern; or the question may be
introduced by the positional clitic c (alternative form co, depending on the speaker),
which co-occurs with the mode markers, but at absolute clause-initial position (45.a-b).

‘Which one is sleepy?’There are two strategies for the expression of imperative constructions. One of
them is the use of an irrealis clause whose nominative participant is the addressee of the
command (46.a). This strategy is employed when the speaker is making a request or
giving advice to the addressee. The other strategy is used in more direct commands, and
that is reflected in the structure of the imperative construction (Haiman 1985; Givón
2001: 34-35). Here, no mode marker is employed. The proposition is expressed, instead,
by the bare or inflected form of the verb, depending on its morphosyntactic class. This is
the only construction type in which a transitive verb may display a nominative pattern of
inflection (i.e., it takes the second person prefix, as one might expect of an imperative
context (46.b)).kaj

Verbal clauses have a structure distinct from nominal ones, not only because they –
obviously – are centered around verbal predicators, but especially because they involve
an interesting combination of alignment patterns (cf. section 4).
In the present discussion, I will be employing the notation A, S, and O, proposed in
Dixon (1979, 1994) and later expanded to include E, in Aikhenvald, Dixon and Onishi’s
(2001) framework. The characterization proposed by Dixon for these symbols, as
representing universal syntactic-semantic primitives, has been critiqued by other
linguists. Some of the problems that have been pointed out include (a) inadequacies in the
semantic characterization of these primitives; (b) the fact that their definition is based on
a mixture of semantic and grammatical properties; and (c) that certain languages do not
seem to follow these kinds of patterning, and therefore such primitives should not be
regarded as universal (Mithun and Chafe 1999; Comrie 1978; 1989). Nonetheless, these
symbols are amply used in the literature as a means to refer to core arguments of
transitive and intransitive verbs.
Keeping in mind the problems raised in the literature regarding the theoretical
implications carried by these symbols, in the present discussion I will use them more as
useful mnemonic devices than as strict theoretical constructs. On the other hand, I will
follow the typology proposed in Aikhenvald, Dixon and Onishi (2001) when laying out
patterns of participant marking noted in Apinajé. Once these patterns have been laid out,
I will propose a set of language internal criteria for identifying what relevant grammatical
relations there are in Apinajé (section 4; cf. Dryer 1997).","[238, 239, 240, 241, 242]"

‘Have a seat, you all, let’s have a seat and gather.’In pragmatically marked use, a token of the pronoun occurs outside the clitic
sequence; in fact, it precedes the sequence clause initially. When the pronoun is thus
placed under focus, it is stressed, and morpheme initial plosives are necessarily voiceless.
Notice that only the realis form of pronouns participates in this strategy.(104) a. Pa

necessarily the case: the pronoun/referent in focus position may be distinct from that in
nominative position (105).","[173, 174, 175]"

‘I know you.’The motivation for these verbs to occur in their nonfinite forms is not clear yet;
further data and analysis are still needed for a better understanding of the occurrence of
nonfinite forms in what otherwise appear to be simple clauses (cf. section V.4).
The next set of patterns could be analyzed in two different ways: either they
present a noncanonical O or they present formally intransitive predicates with an
obligatory oblique argument (E) instead of an O. In favor of the former analysis is the
obligatory nature of the second argument. In favor of the latter analysis is the fact that the
putative A for some verbs follows the standard A/SA pattern (unmarked, clause-initial);
but for other verbs, it follows the pattern for subjects of descriptives (clause-initial
nominative pronoun, SO verbal prefix).
The verbs shown in (55) are based on intransitive stems, which take no person
marking. Thus, both arguments of the predication must be marked outside the verb stem.
For this set in particular, the A/SA argument is indicated with the nominative free pronoun,238and the O argument is marked with either the dative, instrumental, locative or inessive
postpositions. These are mostly utterance verbs, in addition to one emotion verb.(55) a.","[250, 251, 252]"
"Ebc

lieVerb arguments may be expressed by full noun phrases within the verb phrase or
by person prefixes; either way, vowel-initial predicators must take relational prefixes.
Relational prefixes, as already mentioned, indicate distributional contiguity and syntactic
constituency between the elements of the phrase. When such contiguity is breached, the
relevant argument is understood as being under focus, as it occurs elsewhere in the
clause. In the case of transitive, monosyllabic predicators, an argument under focus is
replaced in the verb phrase by the third person accusative prefix ku-, which serves as a
resumptive pronoun (35-36).",[233]
"Genitive constructions. The structure of a genitive construction is determined by the
subclass – alienable or inalienable – of the head noun (section III.3.1.1.1). Thus, a noun
phrase headed by an inalienable noun is characterized structurally by juxtaposition (1.a-b)
or, if person prefixes are involved, by prefixation on the head noun (1.c-d); in either case,
a relational prefix occurs between a vowel-initial head and its dependent noun or person
prefix.(1) a. kuwe=r

2-RP-ear‘your ear’On the other hand, when the head of a noun phrase is a member of the alienable
class, the structure of the genitive construction involves the occurrence of a
postpositional phrase headed by the genitive postposition õ, which requires the relational200prefix - (2). The postpositional phrase encodes the genitive element and is dependent on
the alienable noun that heads the higher structure; note that the alienable noun does not
take any kind of prefix – relational or personal – despite the constituency relation it holds
with the genitive postpositional phrase (2.c), as indicated by intonational, distributional
and semantic factors.(2) a. [i--õ]

contiguity between the elements involved, which may not be interrupted by extraneous
morphological material; the intonation pattern, with all elements encompassed under a
single intonation contour; and phrasal stress, which falls on the last element of the phrase,
that is, the head (3).","[213, 214]"

reduplication in Apinajé is more a lexicalized result than a fully productive process.
Another point is that the semantic relationship between reduplicated stems and
their respective bases may be completely obscure, as illustrated by the verb preprek ‘be
fast; rush’, based on the root prek ‘tall’ (but see kapreprek, section 3.1.2.2).
Although reduplication is more common in the formation of verbs, a few noun
stems are also formed in this way. However, some of these stems may result from the
conversion of reduplicated verbs into nouns (25.b), or are compounds that include
reduplicated verbal stems (25.c).(25) a.brbr

"4.2. Imperatives
In imperative clauses, bound person inflection also displays a nominative pattern, in what
seems to be a unique occurrence of this pattern for person marking in Apinajé (85-87). In
(85.a), the O argument of the verb is overtly expressed, forming a phrase with it. In
(85.b), the O argument is not overtly mentioned, in which case, the verb inflects for A.
This occurrence forms a nominative pattern with the person agreement marking of the
descriptive predicates; combine (85.b) and (86.a-b), which contrast with the intransitive
predicate in (87).(85) a. kag

pronouns, which are zero in many cases, but which may also come attached to the
ergative marker (or expressed by its suppletive form, in the case of the third person).
Otherwise, it is pragmatics that indicates which grammatical relation is being relativized.","[297, 298]"
"1971. Criteria for the establishment of constituency
Phrasal and clausal constituency are detectable in Apinajé according to three types of
criteria: prosodic, morphological, and distributional. By prosodic criteria I mean (a) the
intonation contour that characterizes phrases and larger constituents as internally
cohesive units, and (b) stress patterns characteristic of such combination of elements.
Another phonological criterion that may help identify the boundaries of a constituent is
the echo-vowel phenomenon, which is indicative of final boundary and must be followed
by silence (sections II.4.5 and III.2.1). This criterion, although helpful, is not as
specifically indicative of constituency, since it may delimit a word said at random, that is,
one that is not necessarily in a constituency relation with some other element (a word
uttered as a citation form, for instance).
The main morphological criterion to be considered is the use of relational prefixes
(section III.4.1.2), which are precisely the overt grammatical marking of phrasal
constituency in Jê (and other Macro-Jê) languages. Relational prefixes are common to
noun, verb, and postpositional phrases, and indicate contiguity between the head of a
phrase and its dependent. Such contiguity is one of the clues for the constituency relation
between the elements, and a violation of this state of affairs has overt grammatical
repercussions as well, such as the use of specific person prefixes for head marking
(section 2.3). Even though the relational prefix strategy indicates the bond between twoword units, and thus would not seem as useful for larger units, it may reccur in sequences
of more than two words thus indicating relevant constituency relations among the units
that participate in the hierarchy (provided the elements involved are vowel-initial).","[210, 211]"
"4.1.2. Relational Prefixes
Relational prefixes constitute another morphological category common to Nouns,
Verbs, and Postpositions. These morphemes are overt indices of the constituency
between a head and a dependent element. In formal terms, relational prefixes serve as
linkers between a given root and some element that immediately attaches to it, including
certain derivational morphemes (139.a), personal prefixes (139.b) or, at a more syntactic
level, dependent noun phrases ((139.c); see section IV.1). The role of relational prefixes183is precisely to indicate this bond between units that belong together, either as constituents
within a phrase, or as the component morphemes of a word, even compounds (139.d-e).(139) a. aw-j-apro

motivated, with the proto-form having been a coronal – presumably palatal – segment
(Davis 1966; Ribeiro 2004), whose reflexes in present-day Apinajé includes some six
different forms. In addition to those, there are elements beginning in a bilabial stop that
display distribution and function similar to those of relational prefixes; however, in
addition to form, other idiosyncrasies indicate that these morphemes must have evolved
historically from a distinct source.","[196, 197]"

of postpositions, resulting in fixed, compound expressions where specific postpositions
and relator nouns associate. The inventory of postpositions noted in these cases is broad,
although it seems to exclude the associative me, the allative wr, and the ablative rum.
The inventory of relator nouns found in the database includes those listed in (88).
Notice the use of the postpositions  ‘locative’, kam ‘inside’, pe ‘detrimental/ablative’,149kot ‘after; behind’, as compared to the particle ri ‘demonstrative’, which has semantic
content typical of postpositions, but does not display their morphological characteristics.","[160, 161, 162, 163]"

goSome alternative hypotheses are possible for the analysis of the morpheme  in
this context, since this marker appears in various positions with distinct meanings, in the
grammar of the language. One hypothesis could be that  is the instrumental postposition
in the examples above, and that would even justify the nonfiniteness of the preceding
verb; after all, in order for it to be the object of a postposition, it must be more nominal
than verbal – and that is what nonfinite verb forms are, in Apinajé.
Another hypothesis is that the morpheme  appearing in these contexts is the
transitive verb ‘do’, which likewise could require a more nominal form of the lexical
verb. According to this interpretation, the sequence of elements involved could be
analyzed as a case of verb serialization, including the lexical verb, the verb , and the
movement or position verb.","[308, 309]"
"Verbs. The nominative argument of a simple verbal clause controls reflexivization and
reciprocity. One target of reflexivization is the direct object of a transitive clause. In this

clausal coordination. The strategies employed include the conjunctions ne and um,

juxtaposition of phrases. The distribution of these markers is also ruled by the contrast
between speech-act and third person participants.
Ne indicates same subject (see discussion of grammatical relations in section 4)

such that both referents are third person participants, the conjunction um is employed
(38.c). When there is switch of reference to a speech-act participant, however, there is
juxtaposition of clauses such that the second referent is introduced by a free pronoun

the same language, with respect to control over reflexives. In Hindi-Urdu, for instance,
dative, genitive and locative arguments control reflexivization, but instrumentals do not
(Onishi 2001).
In Apinajé, noncanonical predicates of the set presented in ((49) section 3.3.1) do
not allow reflexivization (103), which means that these are really monovalent predicates,
and not predicates that involve third-person impersonal verb forms.","[282, 283]"

‘You are cold.’FCTAt a closer look, one could hypothesize that the predicator in these cases may be
taking a zero third person marker, in which case the predicator could not be adequately
descibed as monovalent. The difficulty with confirming this hypothesis is that, in some
cases, a regular verb adopts an alternative form which is specific to this kind of
predication. Take the example of m kr ‘feel cold’: elsewhere, the form of the predicator
is akr ‘be.cold’, which may take person inflection, thus also employing the relational
prefix j-. In the case of a zero third person form, the relational prefix would not occur; but
the formative a- would not be lost either. Therefore, the best criteria for deciding whether
these are mono- or bivalent predicators, and even whether the participants marked with
postpositions are or are not core arguments, must come from syntax. For the time being,
I will simply lay out the morphological patterns involved, and will postpone a discussion
of the syntactic evidence until section 4.",[248]

irrealis contexts, however, the third person is overtly and necessarily encoded by ja,
which occurs immediately postposed to the irrealis marker kt (107.c). The presence of
the irrealis morpheme is also mandatory in this case. The third person (demonstrative)
pronoun ja is realized alternatively as [da] or [ra], the initial coronal segment resulting
from assimilation to the coronal coda of the mood clitic kt (107).nam

emphatic forms. Emphatic first and second person pronouns include an oral open vowel163and the suffix -m in root-final position; the stem initial plosive is always voiceless, since
the pronoun carries discourse stress. The emphatic third person pronoun is also realized
with an open vowel. The inventory of emphatic personal pronouns as compared to their
nonemphatic counterparts is listed in table III.2. The example in (108) is illustrative.","[176, 177]"

FCT154This morpheme is transparently related to itc ‘be strong’, which is a descriptive
stem in all respects: it inflects for person, in which case it takes the relational prefix c-;
and operates as a predicator, though it may be a noun modifier, as other descriptives.

strong
‘My husband is strong.’The morpheme rac (and its variant raci) has the lexical meanings ‘large; much’. It may
occur as a noun modifier, and in compound noun stems, such as go rac ‘river’ (lit.:
“water=large”) and kri rac ‘city’ (“sitting=large”). As a modifier of the predicate, it may
be further modified by kumrc. Similarly to ru, and in contrast to tjc, this marker
usually modifies predicators which encode a permanent property (97.c), in addition to
more eventive ones (97.d-e). Structurally, this morpheme never appears inflected or
derived, in my database; it occurs only in its bare form.
One morphosyntactic property of raci that is worthy of notice is that, this
morpheme modifies descriptive verbs derived with the morpheme -ji. In this respect, it
contrasts with ru, which does not suit that purpose (97.b). Additionally, evidence155indicates that, if used with a transitive verb, this morpheme may refer to the quantity of
the direct object (97.d-e), even though it appears syntactically as an intensifier of the
verb.i-m bc
